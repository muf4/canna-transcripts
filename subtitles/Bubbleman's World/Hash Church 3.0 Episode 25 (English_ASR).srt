13
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:39,719
days almost a hundred days since the

14
00:00:37,878 --> 00:00:42,718
last time we did a hash church if you

15
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:44,520
can imagine it was a bit of a long break

16
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,120
I know that everyone's been busy doing

17
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,399
all sorts of different things and uh I

18
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:52,000
just thought it was a good time to throw

19
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:55,198
one been talking a lot with Addison

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,799
Deora and the 800 pounds Mantra these

21
00:00:55,198 --> 00:01:00,238
guys are throwing the legends of hash

22
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:02,280
dinner down in California and I thought

23
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:03,878
well let's do a little hash church we

24
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,840

25
00:01:03,878 --> 00:01:09,079
talk about some past Legends of hashes

26
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:12,799
and really most importantly just to see

27
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:15,079

with my veterans Action Council dude

it's been awesome yeah we had had a

35
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:37,040
wonderful conversation with gome Chomsky

36
00:01:33,078 --> 00:01:37,039
last Friday which dude I saw

37
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:42,719
that just crazy I I watched that bro

38
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,040
manufacturing consent was one of my

39
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:48,239
favorite books back in the day that [ __ ]

40
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:51,799
is no joke yeah one of our members

41
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:54,399
Ricardo pra uh basically went to one of

42
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:56,920
his classes there in Arizona at the

43
00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:00,359
college and um he's one of our members

44
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:02,200
so he asked him and he said yeah so we

45
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:05,319
were very fortunate to have that

46
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,960
discussion and literally we spent some

47
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:10,959
time crafting the questions because we

48
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:15,519
didn't want to come off um you know not

49
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:17,840
prepared gnome chsky bro gnome Chomsky I

50
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:20,680
know it's have you read manufacturing

51
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,039
consent of course

52
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,800
dude I mean I've been reading gnome

53
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:27,079
since I was

54
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,599
teenager so to actually sit down and

55
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,360
have a conversation with him was

56
00:02:28,598 --> 00:02:33,439
humbling beyond all measure but it also

57
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,319
validated our work that we're doing at

58
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:37,878
the national and international level I'm

59
00:02:35,318 --> 00:02:40,958
working with Michael crowz I actually

60
00:02:37,878 --> 00:02:43,919
spoke at the UN in April and uh we're

61
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:46,199
preparing to go to Vienna uh in the

62
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:49,479
spring as well as we're preparing for a

63
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:51,199
Lobby day in Washington DC so we vets

64
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:54,318
are really putting on the pressure

65
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:56,560
really trying to put the US VA system

66
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:59,079
and the Canadian VA system together

67
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:02,560
because we want what you have in Canada

68
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:05,480
which is the access as the availability

69
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,319
to literally order on your cell phone

70
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:09,878
right now and have your medicine within

71
00:03:07,318 --> 00:03:13,479
three days you get a rating per certain

72
00:03:09,878 --> 00:03:14,878
amount of grams per day so I won't go

73
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:17,318
all into it I see we've got our other

74
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:18,719

Marcus whoops

180
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,800
you know what I'll be honest I have

181
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,800
starlink and every once in a while

182
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,639
starlink just glitches for about like

183
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,000
five five 10 seconds otherwise it's

184
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:43,680
incredible shout out to Elon Musk for

185
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,759
putting satellites out into space and

186
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,560
creating the internet where you know I

187
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,439
live in an area that doesn't have good

188
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,879
internet so when he first put up his

189
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:53,800
first 2,000 satellites he put it up into

190
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:55,240
an area where a lot of indigenous people

191
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,360
live a lot of people that live that

192
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:00,319
don't have access that's where he put up

193
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,800
the first thousand or so and so I guess

194
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:05,039
he's eventually going to get to 60,000

195
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,680
uh eventually he'll eliminate cell phone

196
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:08,360
services because everything will be

197
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:10,319
WhatsApp and Wi-Fi calling because

198
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:13,080
you'll have Wi-Fi literally everywhere

199
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:15,598
you go in the world kind of scary kind

200
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:17,120
of awesome I figured I'd get on the beta

201
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:19,399
and support someone who's thinking

202
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,399
outside of the box because uh I don't

203
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:27,000
know I really appreciate thinking

204
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:27,000
outside of the box uh that's that's my

205
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:32,158
trip kind of all of our trips if we all

206
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,479
stayed within the Box we all wouldn't be

207
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:36,479
here

208
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:38,839
correct no exactly we're trying to get

209
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,038
the star get the office we're trying to

210
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:42,519
get the star link at the office for 800

211
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:46,199
because we have terrible internet over

212
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:48,879
there so and we have no good

213
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:52,640
options actually you don't need a box

214
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:55,759
anymore because the most pot is seedless

215
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:58,519
you needed a box when you wanted to uh

216
00:08:55,759 --> 00:09:02,679
you know clean your seeds out of your

217
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:05,039
weed but those days are gone no you're

218
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:08,000
right I fought for a long time to get

219
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:09,078
out of the box so I'm glad to be on this

220
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,399

get his dabinator through Max because

242
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:09,639
Max is such a [ __ ] awesome guy but

243
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,680
when I first got mine and I don't I

244
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:14,039
finally killed mine but it took me

245
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:17,120
almost four

246
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:19,159
years left it on pretty much every

247
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,278
single day and when Sam says he's left

248
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:24,319
his on every single day I can promise

249
00:10:22,278 --> 00:10:27,240
you I bet you

250
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,760
that or it's probably rusted into place

251
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:32,519
because it's never been used uh I've

252
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:35,799
also took it to Jamaica with me and it

253
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:37,120
works fine with uh Jamaican electricity

254
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:38,879
and you could even use it with

255
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,919
motorcycle

256
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:44,958

00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:10,519
do a Legends in California I was like

330
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:13,600
dude I mean obviously does the bear [ __ ]

331
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:15,519
in the woods and uh I did find out that

332
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,959
indeed um the bear does [ __ ] in the

333
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:22,480
woods I'm not sure if you guys have seen

334
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:25,319
this but uh yeah it's been proven guys

335
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:28,600
the bear does [ __ ] in the woods right

336
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:29,720
there that's proof I need a I need a

337
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,800
picture of

338
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,040
talking I need a picture of the Pope

339
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:34,240
[ __ ] in the woods that's the other

340
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:36,559
one I

341
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,360
need that's a good oh yeah does the pope

342
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:40,159
[ __ ] in the woods there you go the pope

343
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:44,800
represents Faith but drives around in a

344
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:47,399
bulletproof vehicle enough said God

345
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:50,159
willing who's he really trust so anyway

346
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:53,000
we started yeah exactly he doesn't trust

347
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:55,159
anyone um so we started talking about it

348
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,958
you know he he's you know and for me I

349
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:59,838
wasn't avidly searching Legends has

350
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:02,198
always been the most organic thing and

351
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:05,519
for those of you that are living under a

352
00:15:02,198 --> 00:15:08,319
rock and don't know what Legends of hash

353
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,919
is and maybe Sam I would love to hear

354
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,480
your perspective as well because I bet

355
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:16,159
you we have slightly different memories

356
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:18,800
or perspectives of how it came to be but

357
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:21,120
from my sense I kind of remember sitting

358
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:24,958
around with you at your place and and

359
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:27,720
Rob probably was there um Michael

360
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:29,719
definitely wasn't there I don't think

361
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,879
for the first conversation but we sort

362
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,639
of started talking about you know well I

363
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:35,759
think it started really with Sam talking

364
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:37,680
about how he'd been at every Cannabis

365
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:40,159
Cup from day one and that him and Rob

366
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:42,039
always got gifted tickets from Hagar and

367
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:43,439
they would show up at everyone and kind

368
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:45,799
of walk

369
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,240
around kind of talking a little bit

370
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:48,958
about some of the stuff we didn't like

371
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:50,720
about it you know it was always it was

372
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:52,559
always a cool thing to bash on high

373
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,959
times for whatever reason even though at

374
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:57,119
the time it was the only gig in town and

375
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:58,479
really it was amazing you know the fact

376
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,679
that they pulled off what they pulled

377
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,000
off it was amazing and it was really

378
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:05,120
also the birth of Legends because we

379
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,559
sort of I remember us talking like hey

380
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:10,240
like if we could just get the best kind

381
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:12,439
of 50 hash afficionados out of this

382
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,440
group of I don't know how many went to

383
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:17,759
the cup like a thousand or 2,000 people

384
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,759
maybe between a, and 1500 in those early

385
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:22,278
days I don't really remember uh and for

386
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:23,600
me it became a metaphor of like yeah

387
00:16:22,278 --> 00:16:26,000
let's run all these people through the

388
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,040
Bubble Bags filter out all the 220s and

389
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,480
the 190s and the 160s and we'll just

390
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:35,318
collect a party of 90 I just want 50 90

391
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:36,639
Micron people at this party and uh is

392
00:16:35,318 --> 00:16:38,759
that how you remember the first

393
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:43,120
conversation going Sam or what's your

394
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:47,240
memory of it I I remember that uh our

395
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:48,560
Focus was really can people didn't have

396
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:51,198
to be

397
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:54,198
necessarily maker in the very very

398
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:54,198
beginning

399
00:17:01,078 --> 00:17:07,438
canvas industry you know and you were a

400
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:10,279
heavyweight and uh appreciated smoking

401
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:12,880
then you got an invite because it was

402
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,879
Invitation

403
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:17,838
Only it definitely wasn't the first year

404
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:20,079
that I was asking to see people's hashes

405
00:17:17,838 --> 00:17:23,038
that Modified by the second or third

406
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:24,318
year I it turned into this like you know

407
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:25,879
because we had this incredible group of

408
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:28,480
people in there the first year it was

409
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:29,679
really an amazing group of people truly

410
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,599
like

411
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:35,240
it's almost sad that we didn't have just

412
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:37,119
one person videographing and have that

413
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:39,599
tape locked in a vault somewhere because

414
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:42,599
to open that in 30 or 40

415
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:44,879
years would have really been something

416
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:48,480
uh incredible to leave behind but at the

417
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:50,799
time for you know of various reasons uh

418
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,319
we and we've always stuck with this that

419
00:17:50,798 --> 00:17:56,359
cameras just should not be allowed um at

420
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:58,038
Legends in Barcelona the last year uh I

421
00:17:56,359 --> 00:18:00,959
did allow one guy to come in to

422
00:17:58,038 --> 00:18:03,798
videograph and we controlled those audio

423
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,798
and videos and there was no you know

424
00:18:03,798 --> 00:18:07,918
everyone was let know at the known at

425
00:18:05,798 --> 00:18:09,879
the door it kind of got to the point too

426
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:12,280
where you know cannabis is becoming more

427
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:14,280
and more legal and there's less and less

428
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:16,399
illegal activity you know in the first

429
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:18,440
years you know there were some people

430
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,320
that that moved large amounts of hash

431
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:23,240
that ended up at the party and in

432
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:24,960
respect to them because not that you

433
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,839
know me and Sam were smoking on that

434
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,480
hash or whatever but it was important

435
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:30,279
that that hash went to where it needed

436
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,079
to go and it was important that those

437
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:35,000
people that would smoke that hash like I

438
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:37,119
was talking to Addison earlier on the

439
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,919
different you know compounds that we

440
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:41,558
consume and if you read Michael Poland's

441
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:43,840
newest book uh this is your mind on

442
00:18:41,558 --> 00:18:46,000
plants or this is your brain on Plants

443
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:48,678
great yeah great book caffeine and he

444
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,679
goes all into the I liked when he talked

445
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:53,280
about how conversations were created

446
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:55,759
that shaped the world after work beers

447
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:59,720
at the bar turned into tea houses and

448
00:18:55,759 --> 00:19:01,759
caffeine coffee coffee houses new people

449
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:03,960
intellectuals started having different

450
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:05,879
conversations in those environments and

451
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:09,279
those conversations started to shape the

452
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:12,280
world and now you know what Legends

453
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:14,399
could potentially really become and

454
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:17,000
maybe it even was a little bit back in

455
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:20,440
the day is to have an event where real

456
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,359
chusy people hashish people get together

457
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:26,080
and now in rooms where we're allowed to

458
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:28,359
get together it's not illegal and we can

459
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:30,000
have conversations that now shape the

460
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:32,240
future future world that we're going to

461
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,038
leave to our children and that [ __ ]

462
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,798
excites me and that's why when you hit

463
00:19:34,038 --> 00:19:38,720
me up Addison and has this not just been

464
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:40,480
super easy too Addison like has this

465
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:43,319
been difficult has there been like lots

466
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,960
of obstacles or is to me it's just felt

467
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:47,720
really flowing and smooth you know

468
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:50,120
everything you guys keep bringing to the

469
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:52,480
table I've talked enough why don't you

470
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:54,599
and Kevin uh mention a little bit about

471
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:58,798
your perspective on this and the plan

472
00:19:54,599 --> 00:20:01,558
for Legends of hash California one

473
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:03,519
definitely thank you man um I think

474
00:20:01,558 --> 00:20:06,319
first thing to speak to what you just

475
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:09,119
said one of the things that I think

476
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:12,399
nowadays is that we all have phones

477
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:15,479
those phones are cameras and bringing

478
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:17,360
the whole tradition of not having phones

479
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:19,440
or cameras is is something that I think

480
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:22,558
is really important we're allowed to do

481
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:24,240
what we do but technically to throw this

482
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:26,558
event in California we're not allowed to

483
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,400
do it so it's still kind of at that not

484
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:30,200
allowed phase in that place and that's

485
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,200
why that's why we have to outwardly

486
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:35,080
build this thing as a dinner which I

487
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:36,759
think though adds to all of adds to what

488
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:39,720
makes this thing so great and makes it

489
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:41,519
so unique compared to any other event

490
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:45,120
you're never told I mean most of these

491
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:47,079
guys these makers um you know they're

492
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:48,759
they're sort of been if it was Legends

493
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:50,960
they were being invited because they had

494
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:53,599
the hash what we tried to incorporate

495
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:56,079
here is when we invite a maker your plus

496
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:58,399
one we we recommend that your plus one

497
00:20:56,079 --> 00:21:00,359
is either the breeder or the farmer and

498
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,759
that way we're putting everybody in the

499
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:05,079
room together on this one and and we're

500
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:07,558
also now Marcus and I were talking

501
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:10,038
earlier and it's like hash makers are

502
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:11,480
awesome you know they're forensic

503
00:21:10,038 --> 00:21:13,798
they're guys that are doing forensic

504
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:16,120
work that are separating things and and

505
00:21:13,798 --> 00:21:17,599
able to like really get it down to the

506
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:20,119
point where it's pure where it's

507
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:22,199
completely isolated that's that's hard

508
00:21:20,119 --> 00:21:24,639
work but in order for them to do their

509
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:27,600
job they can't do it without great

510
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:29,640
material it's just it's how many people

511
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:32,639
are coming to your event do you have any

512
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:35,559
idea yes so we have I'll break it down

513
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:37,759
real quick there's 25 makers those

514
00:21:35,558 --> 00:21:40,480
makers each get a plus one which will be

515
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:44,000
either the farmer or the breeder then

516
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:46,400
there's 20 guests that are industry you

517
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,240
know people that we think those 20

518
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:51,480
makers would benefit from being in the

519
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:53,319
room with industry guys guys that are

520
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:55,120
hash that are hash guys guys that are

521
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:57,399
literally legitimately have a reason to

522
00:21:55,119 --> 00:22:00,399
be in the room with them whether it's

523
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:02,400
you know being in the room with uh Brian

524
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,640
from vital Garden Supply which is one of

525
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,400
you know Brian has put more organic

526
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,640
inputs into the Cannabis Supply

527
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,919
production for California than probably

528
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,919
most people over the years we just want

529
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:15,759
them to be a room full of guys like that

530
00:22:12,919 --> 00:22:18,000
so those 20 will be those type of cats

531
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:20,319
not necessarily influencers but just

532
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,839
people who have really lent to the

533
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:27,119
production of good material good hash

534
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:27,119
and and a lot of guys too that have

535
00:22:31,038 --> 00:22:34,839
of one before but we're we're hoping

536
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:37,119
that there's going to be more of these

537
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:39,199
and we want to just get that those those

538
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:42,278
acers to be guys that might have not

539
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:44,080
been invited the 20 are people that are

540
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:46,038
pretty much you know industry guys that

541
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:51,199
really should be there and then we have

542
00:22:46,038 --> 00:22:54,158
15 spaces um that are that are staff and

543
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,759
uh sponsorship so that's where we're

544
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:56,919
kind of fitting fitting that all

545
00:22:55,759 --> 00:22:59,079
together putting it together so it'll be

546
00:22:56,919 --> 00:23:02,600
85 people total

547
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:04,678
um lebanes dinner it's going to be uh

548
00:23:02,599 --> 00:23:06,719
you know I knew that this thing was I

549
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:08,120
knew that this thing was green lit and

550
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,519
by the culture and everyone else when I

551
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:12,439
reached out to deppy and I invited him

552
00:23:10,519 --> 00:23:13,759
as a guest and deppy came back and was

553
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:16,880
like well we want to do a Mothership

554
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:20,240
drop during your event um so now what's

555
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:22,880
cool is he's he's producing glass that's

556
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:25,120
specifically designed and and and sort

557
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:29,200
of the Aesthetics he did a he did a

558
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:31,359
series called um uh Botanicals which was

559
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,600
a series that kind of not did a nod back

560
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:35,719
to to Hash which was kind of cool

561
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:39,038
solventless hash now he's going to

562
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:40,519
incorporate chemistry with Botanicals

563
00:23:39,038 --> 00:23:42,200
and they're going to do that drop at

564
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:44,839
Legends which is kind of cool so

565
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:47,240
specifically for hash makers kind of um

566
00:23:44,839 --> 00:23:48,720
he was pretty stoked about it so it's

567
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:50,640
it's I knew that it was going to be

568
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,319
something different uh as soon as we got

569
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,400
his Blessing and as soon as we started

570
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:56,960
to see uh you know the the the biggest

571
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,679
guys that we reached out to I I was

572
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,000
calling everyone we wanted to keep keep

573
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:03,038
this thing in line with Legends and I

574
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,839
figured you know in my mind I'm like

575
00:24:03,038 --> 00:24:06,839
what would Marcus do would Marcus would

576
00:24:04,839 --> 00:24:08,879
Marcus send you an email with all the

577
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:11,038
information in it probably not I was

578
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,559
like Marcus would would just message you

579
00:24:11,038 --> 00:24:14,558
and be like I need to give do a call

580
00:24:12,558 --> 00:24:16,240
with you you know like an old drug deal

581
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:18,200
so we wanted to make sure that every one

582
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,120
of the contacts that go on for Legends

583
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:23,120
is just like an old drug deal it's a

584
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:25,678
phone call you know it's it's a hey bro

585
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:28,519
if I text you just call this number back

586
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:31,759
so everything's done in in line with the

587
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:34,720
old way and it's like a phone call uh no

588
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:36,359
cameras no phones we're making sure that

589
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,519
uh you know it's secretive in that sense

590
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:39,038
we're making sure that anyone talks

591
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:41,639
about it talks about it as a dinner so

592
00:24:39,038 --> 00:24:44,079
it's cloaked in that original sort of

593
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:45,840
secret you know how it was back in the

594
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:48,240
day which I think is helping the event a

595
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:49,480
bunch because um it it's just kind of

596
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,599
making people understand that it's an

597
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:55,000
exclusive event that it's that it's

598
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:56,558
invite only um and that it's going to be

599
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,759
a celebration of hashes you know we

600
00:24:56,558 --> 00:25:01,038
wanted to this year incorporate after

601
00:24:58,759 --> 00:25:03,240
Afghanistan as the cultural sort of

602
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:05,359
focus for it with what's going on there

603
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:07,079
and I think it's a good time to kind of

604
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:09,199
to to let everybody know that the United

605
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:11,158
States is gonna get a bunch of Afghan

606
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,960
refugees uh a bunch of people from

607
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:15,399
Afghanistan and hopefully we get some

608
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,759
guys that make great hash that we can uh

609
00:25:15,398 --> 00:25:19,319
that can come and show us and teach us

610
00:25:16,759 --> 00:25:21,558
some other cool stuff so um yeah it's

611
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:23,839
it's G to be an event that or not even

612
00:25:21,558 --> 00:25:26,158
an event it's a dinner we're we're

613
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:28,158
really just honored to be able to put it

614
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:30,960
on and and there's not a day goes by

615
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:33,000
that I I don't wake up and be like all

616
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,798
right is this going to fall apart today

617
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,640
you know is this going to and and it

618
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:37,960
it's done the complete opposite every

619
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,480
person that's wanted to be involved has

620
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:42,640
reached out um we've got big guys behind

621
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,278
it that want to help with it and it was

622
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,679
really hard for us to kind of figure out

623
00:25:44,278 --> 00:25:48,398
how to pay for it how to take care of it

624
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:52,120
because we don't want to bring in just

625
00:25:48,398 --> 00:25:53,558
any sponsor um but it is a dinner it is

626
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:55,879
you know when we when we've gone to

627
00:25:53,558 --> 00:25:58,000
other events and we've seen other things

628
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:59,720
uh what's going on we just looked at it

629
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,240
uh one of the big conversations that

630
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:04,159
Marcus and I had was you know how do you

631
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,720
take Legends which has been so secretive

632
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:08,480
and so protected and bring it out to the

633
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,798
public now and put it into a

634
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:13,319
recreational State how do you do that

635
00:26:10,798 --> 00:26:15,278
you know and it's like well there's

636
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:17,079
certain components that have to transfer

637
00:26:15,278 --> 00:26:19,079
and one of them is going to be you know

638
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:20,839
it has to be marketed in some way it has

639
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:23,158
to be we want to eventually open this

640
00:26:20,839 --> 00:26:24,879
thing up to a larger Community uh and be

641
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:26,880
able to allow people to sort of enjoy

642
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,919
hashish at the same level and

643
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:31,480
appreciation for hashish at level may

644
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:33,640
never be at like the geeked out you know

645
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:35,880
nerdy level that we are at but at the

646
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:37,919
same time to educate them on hash and to

647
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:40,120
get them open to like what the [ __ ] is

648
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:41,880
Hash you know I I I talk to some people

649
00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:43,759
and they think hash is like opium or

650
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:45,520
something they don't even [ __ ] know

651
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:48,079
like they they still to this day are

652
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:49,679
like oh that's weed mixed with Heroin

653
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:52,000
right and I'm like what the [ __ ] are you

654
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:54,600
talking about so the broader public

655
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,000
really doesn't understand you know what

656
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:59,119
hash is about me and Marcus talked about

657
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,558
it and and the big picture the big dream

658
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:04,439
would be to throw a massive hash event

659
00:27:01,558 --> 00:27:05,918
in California recreationally legal and

660
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,960
invite all kinds of people and educate

661
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:10,799
them and then within that event on one

662
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:12,319
of the nights we we tuck Legends into

663
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:14,000
that night because now we've got

664
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:15,558
everyone there we can bring you know

665
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,720
glass culture everything to this and

666
00:27:15,558 --> 00:27:20,359
then at some point now you know I was

667
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:22,440
thinking Marcus can finally monetize

668
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:23,839
this thing and actually take it to other

669
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,320
places and build something so other

670
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:28,359
people can start to enjoy it because

671
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:30,158
weed's legal now it's not illegal it's

672
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:31,839
not what it used to be and it's not like

673
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:33,480
uh you know in some places we still have

674
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:34,839
brothers that are you know sitting

675
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,480
behind bars we still have brothers that

676
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:39,038
are that are you know having to duck and

677
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:41,360
run but we all know the fun of the duck

678
00:27:39,038 --> 00:27:44,640
and run like I I I honestly in a lot of

679
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:46,798
ways miss the duck and run days of of

680
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,360
hammering it and and you know the bank

681
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:51,798
of the earth and all this cool [ __ ] that

682
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:54,000
we lived a part of um nowadays it's like

683
00:27:51,798 --> 00:27:55,679
you know we can [ __ ] legally do [ __ ]

684
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,240
and it's sort of some of the taste has

685
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:59,798
been taken out of it so um I don't know

686
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,839
I think this we want to keep this so

687
00:27:59,798 --> 00:28:03,558
that taste is still there but then at

688
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:04,879
the same time how the [ __ ] do you bring

689
00:28:03,558 --> 00:28:07,079
this thing to the bigger public there's

690
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:10,559
a lot of nerves and kind of doing that

691
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:12,918
so um love that you I love that you guys

692
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:15,960
are connecting it to the Farms that it's

693
00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:18,640
really all about like let's get hash

694
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:20,519
cultiv ours like where all these new

695
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,919
people in Cali and old folks that have

696
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:24,399
been growing forever that produce

697
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:27,840
something really special one year where

698
00:28:24,398 --> 00:28:30,000
can we put that where it's on display

699
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:32,240
and gets the attention it deserves to

700
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,519
get by the people that it needs to get

701
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,599
from so not only is it promoting

702
00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:39,798
promoting hash makers and and the love

703
00:28:36,599 --> 00:28:41,879
of hash but of course the root which is

704
00:28:39,798 --> 00:28:45,319
you know that organic regenerative

705
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:48,559
biodynamic farmer who's producing and

706
00:28:45,319 --> 00:28:51,240
loving this resin into being and they

707
00:28:48,558 --> 00:28:53,678
you know it's all just like a really we

708
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:56,278
never did that at Legends it was always

709
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:58,440
kind of individuals and Independence and

710
00:28:56,278 --> 00:29:00,558
you could even go buy great hah if you

711
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:03,278
wanted to uh you know end up at a legend

712
00:29:00,558 --> 00:29:06,759
you know if you had what was nice about

713
00:29:03,278 --> 00:29:08,919
Legends what was nice about Legends was

714
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:12,398
because it was in Amsterdam at the high

715
00:29:08,919 --> 00:29:16,320
times we had such an international

716
00:29:12,398 --> 00:29:18,239
selection of people it it I mean except

717
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:20,879
for there was a lot of Canadians there

718
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:23,240
more than anybody I'm joking mostly

719
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:25,799
Californians and then

720
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:27,720
Canadians oh yeah dude it was awesome it

721
00:29:25,798 --> 00:29:30,599
was I remember literally counting people

722
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:32,720
from over 20 countries at a Legends

723
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:35,240
dinner yeah like there's people

724
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:37,480
representing for from so many countries

725
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:39,399
right now and uh you know one thing I

726
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:41,360
will say about Legends as well is I I

727
00:29:39,398 --> 00:29:43,000
never left the Legends and got the

728
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:46,759
Cannabis co uh

729
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:49,319
cough that was always uh at other places

730
00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:53,278
so no but there were several times when

731
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:54,798
the uh uh restaurant arti the Lebanese

732
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:58,440
restaurant where we used to hold the

733
00:29:54,798 --> 00:30:01,319
event was so filled with smoke that I

734
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:04,600
had to go outside and breathe some fresh

735
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:08,359
air yeah yeah I know that was

736
00:30:04,599 --> 00:30:10,480
gnarly that wobbly is uh that that thing

737
00:30:08,359 --> 00:30:12,240
is unlike anything I've ever hit in my

738
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,399
entire life I remember that I waited

739
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,679
every time I went I would wait as long

740
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:19,199
as I could to hit that thing because I

741
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:22,480
knew that after I hit it it was just

742
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:24,880
[ __ ] space used to blow my mind where

743
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:28,360
was that girl from Denmark or something

744
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:32,440
that used to Marcus that used to hit on

745
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:35,079
it like crazy oh she even lit a few for

746
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:37,399
us that's right oh my God I almost

747
00:30:35,079 --> 00:30:38,839
forgot about her she was from Denmark

748
00:30:37,398 --> 00:30:41,479
that's

749
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:43,678
right unbelievable listen it wasn't just

750
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:47,278
that Hubbly Bubbly either Addison it was

751
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:50,000
it was it was Sam's hash like that hash

752
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:51,359
is not normal and it wasn't back then

753
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,599
even when I had already been smoking

754
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:56,000
full m and I felt like oh yeah dude I

755
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:57,759
know what quality is I went to his house

756
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,720
and the first time I smoked a bowl of

757
00:30:57,759 --> 00:31:04,158
his cash and I'm [ __ ] you not this

758
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:07,558
is not a lie I literally got so high so

759
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:09,559
fast I I was like oh no what if I [ __ ]

760
00:31:07,558 --> 00:31:11,398
myself or vomit or I just went through

761
00:31:09,558 --> 00:31:15,359
all these crazy thoughts and then he fed

762
00:31:11,398 --> 00:31:16,319
me like 20 more no joke while he himself

763
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:18,638
took

764
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:20,638
50 like over the course of a couple

765
00:31:18,638 --> 00:31:22,798
hours I left that guy's house so [ __ ]

766
00:31:20,638 --> 00:31:25,879
up in my head I was just

767
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:27,599
like I remember Rob saying like oh yeah

768
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:29,960
I was really stoned last night I was

769
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:31,439
like I mean how stoned could you be Rob

770
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:33,919
I mean come on what did you eat like an

771
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:36,000
ounce of resin and then I found myself

772
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:38,159
in that position walking home from Sam's

773
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:42,159
one late night in Amsterdam and just

774
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:44,120
being absolutely floored at how strong

775
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:46,320
that man hash was and then of course I'm

776
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:48,278
like oh okay so he went and lived in the

777
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:50,240
hash producing country collected the

778
00:31:48,278 --> 00:31:53,240
seeds grew hundreds of thousands to pick

779
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:55,798
the varieties bred them with his Savant

780
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:57,960
like capabilities then processed them

781
00:31:55,798 --> 00:32:01,079
with his own [ __ ] incredible

782
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:03,319
processing methods uh that's a full meal

783
00:32:01,079 --> 00:32:05,759
deal that's like a a full house if it's

784
00:32:03,319 --> 00:32:09,720
the deck of cards I remember to Marcus

785
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:13,158
that the first couple events it was

786
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:15,038
mostly my house we were smoking then

787
00:32:13,159 --> 00:32:17,240
everybody started bringing better and

788
00:32:15,038 --> 00:32:19,679
better and better especially with water

789
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:22,798
has that's what really changed the world

790
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:25,399
first water has came in and and really

791
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:27,879
lots of people had really high quality

792
00:32:25,398 --> 00:32:30,000
water hash and then it just kept growing

793
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:32,440
growing and growing and

794
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,079
growing which you could also tell based

795
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:37,240
on on Sam's level of utter and complete

796
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:38,839
snobbery it was like at a level back

797
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:41,159
then that was like you couldn't even

798
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:43,798
[ __ ] imagine it it was palpable he

799
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:46,799
would just not smoke anyone's hash he

800
00:32:43,798 --> 00:32:49,240
would only smoke his own hash I would

801
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:50,960
smoke anybody's hash I would smoke

802
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:54,278
anybody's that was as good or better

803
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:57,840
than mine and there wasn't any is what

804
00:32:54,278 --> 00:33:00,519
I'm saying back back back I know that

805
00:32:57,839 --> 00:33:02,038
you were just fing your own I was like

806
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:03,960
this [ __ ] won't take like a hit

807
00:33:02,038 --> 00:33:07,038
of my five

808
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:10,639
star oh I wish I had po the

809
00:33:07,038 --> 00:33:12,558
seven could you imagine Marcus if if um

810
00:33:10,638 --> 00:33:14,798
there was a selection of hash from each

811
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:19,200
of the legends that would have been put

812
00:33:14,798 --> 00:33:21,359
away and saved stored cryogenically for

813
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,480
uh for someday to come out and get

814
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:25,000
smoked could you imagine I mean that's

815
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:26,639
that would have been better than any

816
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:30,960
footage of anything I think just the

817
00:33:26,638 --> 00:33:33,038
taste do it at California 1 at the first

818
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:35,000
annual California Legends you can do

819
00:33:33,038 --> 00:33:36,240
that very thing this is what happens you

820
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,679
get together with your

821
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:42,839
friends what you need to do is put put a

822
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:44,798
kilo away of each of the winners it's

823
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:48,199
it's gonna be tough

824
00:33:44,798 --> 00:33:50,720
yeah Kevin I think we just raed we're

825
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:54,200
gonna need a kilo and 40 grams to make

826
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:56,919
this thing sorry guys kilo and a 40 gr

827
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:59,038
but I mean thinking of that like that

828
00:33:56,919 --> 00:34:01,519
like a hash ball like that would be

829
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:05,158
incredible and the Legends you know

830
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:08,559
event really could uh I guarantee if you

831
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:12,039
keep it from oxygen and you freeze it

832
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:15,639
and you keep it out of the light and it

833
00:34:12,039 --> 00:34:18,119
does not change in a decade or two

834
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:20,119
really or if changes so little you could

835
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:22,919
barely notice it

836
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:24,480
even well built root seller would store

837
00:34:22,918 --> 00:34:28,559

838
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:31,760

citrusy yes it is Sam it's the it's the

914
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:18,440
Eric 77 cut

915
00:38:14,199 --> 00:38:20,639
actually that's a rare one 877 cut or if

916
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:23,079
that's if the kids are even calling it

917
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:23,078
that these

918
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:30,599
days many people have told me that I

919
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:33,039
made a hybrid with skunk number one and

920
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:36,599
California Orange two of my favorite

921
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:41,079
indicia sativa hybrids back in the

922
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:43,838
80s and uh that's what I've been told

923
00:38:41,079 --> 00:38:47,000
Tangi was selected

924
00:38:43,838 --> 00:38:48,559
from I think that's the same cut Sam

925
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:52,079
Actually I think it's the California

926
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:56,000
Orange that that's uh that's the

927
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:57,599
surviving cut might be that same one Sam

928
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,239
from what I understand that's it's

929
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:05,000
believed to be that yeah because not all

930
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:07,399
California Orange was uh citrusy uh some

931
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,920
of them were barely citry and some of

932
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:12,599
them were really pronounced citry and

933
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:14,519
those are the ones I liked yeah this is

934
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:17,039
that was yeah that's the one Shanty Baba

935
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:20,039
had Shanty Baba had the super citrusy

936
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:22,480
one and he had like a multi-acre

937
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:24,920
greenhouse in bellan Zona in the south

938
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:27,119
of Switzerland and I remember walking

939
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:29,639
into it and they were all about six to

940
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:31,880
seven feet tall Christmas trees Citrus

941
00:39:29,639 --> 00:39:33,318
had my eyes watering because I was

942
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,800
literally crying it was one of the most

943
00:39:33,318 --> 00:39:37,639
beautiful things I'd ever seen I asked

944
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:40,400
him right away I said how who grew these

945
00:39:37,639 --> 00:39:43,279
plants this is incredible then he told

946
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:46,599
me it was their first year growing them

947
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:48,920
and they were the local Swiss Rose

948
00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:51,079
gardeners that he just took and said

949
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:54,519
okay listen this is just like roses

950
00:39:51,079 --> 00:39:56,280
except uh instead of thorns it's a resin

951
00:39:54,519 --> 00:39:57,838
that you can get in your eyes so don't

952
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:59,359

00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:05,599
included Rosen into res into uh the

978
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:09,318
Legends for uh California 1 nice I I I

979
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:11,880
would let rosin into any contest because

980
00:41:09,318 --> 00:41:15,838
technically it's not old school hash for

981
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:19,358
sure but it can be just as clean as

982
00:41:15,838 --> 00:41:21,599
potent and as beautiful and tpping rich

983
00:41:19,358 --> 00:41:23,960
as any of the dry sit I ever made in my

984
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:25,400
life we let it in because of how it

985
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:28,519
makes us

986
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:30,480
feel are you uh requiring that it's only

987
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:33,559
hash rosin or you letting letting flower

988
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:37,199
stuff in um no they get to they can

989
00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:40,000
select either melt or rosin so it's

990
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:42,759
their choice if they want to do flower

991
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,480
rosin they're more than welcome to um we

992
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:46,720
don't really see a bunch of guys that

993
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:50,159
are doing flower rosin it's mainly it's

994
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:53,078
all gone to um hash rosin at this point

995
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:54,920
but um yeah I mean it's it's we wanted

996
00:41:53,079 --> 00:41:57,800
to incorporate the grower on this one

997
00:41:54,920 --> 00:42:00,480
for the main reason that when I got into

998
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:02,240
cannabis it it I was a grower at first

999
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,800
and I grew some plants and I didn't

1000
00:42:02,239 --> 00:42:06,598
become a hash maker till I became a

1001
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:08,680
grower and it was that lifestyle of

1002
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:11,318
hiding in there and you know trimming my

1003
00:42:08,679 --> 00:42:14,199
own [ __ ] and I'd get the finger has then

1004
00:42:11,318 --> 00:42:17,239
then i' Mark I was Mark's rep for bubble

1005
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:19,000
bags in uh Northern California when I

1006
00:42:17,239 --> 00:42:21,159
was a sales rep in the snowboard

1007
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:23,039
industry and that's how Mark and I met

1008
00:42:21,159 --> 00:42:25,598
so I was running around meeting people

1009
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:27,239
at snowboard shops and at night I'd come

1010
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:29,240
home from being a rep and I'd work my

1011
00:42:27,239 --> 00:42:32,039
grow room and i' you know Saturday I'd

1012
00:42:29,239 --> 00:42:34,118
make hash and [ __ ] you know so we

1013
00:42:32,039 --> 00:42:36,159
wanted to make sure that the grower was

1014
00:42:34,119 --> 00:42:38,039
there because we feel like there

1015
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:41,078
wouldn't be a hash maker without the

1016
00:42:38,039 --> 00:42:42,960
grower it wouldn't exist and some of us

1017
00:42:41,079 --> 00:42:46,800
the way we got into it was through that

1018
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:49,960
door was through like that lonely lify

1019
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:54,079
you know also too for for resin there's

1020
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:58,079
actually dry shift rosin there's water

1021
00:42:54,079 --> 00:43:01,559
has rosin there's fresh frozen rosin

1022
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:05,480
there's from plant so I mean it just

1023
00:43:01,559 --> 00:43:10,240
goes on and on but uh to me it's all

1024
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:12,039
good if at the end you like it yeah hey

1025
00:43:10,239 --> 00:43:12,838
somebody can blast and you know what

1026
00:43:12,039 --> 00:43:16,519
this

1027
00:43:12,838 --> 00:43:18,519
isn't this isn't an Instagram post this

1028
00:43:16,519 --> 00:43:20,280
isn't for clout this is just for how it

1029
00:43:18,519 --> 00:43:23,400
makes you feel and wouldn't it be

1030
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:25,640
amazing at some crazy Legend dinner if

1031
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:29,200
someone came in with hash r or flower

1032
00:43:25,639 --> 00:43:31,960
rosin and SM mashed everyone off the

1033
00:43:29,199 --> 00:43:34,199
we're open to that I'm open you got to

1034
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:36,760
chuckle to exactly you got to be open to

1035
00:43:34,199 --> 00:43:38,480
anything or I even think I think hash

1036
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:41,280
makers out there make sure that doesn't

1037
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:45,318
happen maybe I mean I think if someone

1038
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:49,319
enters with with real sift like actual

1039
00:43:45,318 --> 00:43:50,719
sift quality made sift instead of melt

1040
00:43:49,318 --> 00:43:52,159
instead of some of these other things I

1041
00:43:50,719 --> 00:43:55,759
think that's something a lot of people

1042
00:43:52,159 --> 00:43:57,838
don't see is actual sift like you know

1043
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:00,280
[ __ ] you can look at SI long enough

1044
00:43:57,838 --> 00:44:02,599
and it turns to [ __ ] melt that's how

1045
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:04,240
sensitive that [ __ ] is so it's you're

1046
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:05,800
talking the purest of the pure and when

1047
00:44:04,239 --> 00:44:07,639
I talk to a lot of people they don't

1048
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:10,400
know they're like oh yeah sift and I'm

1049
00:44:07,639 --> 00:44:13,279
like that's not sift like that's sift is

1050
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:14,838
so different you know like someone could

1051
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:16,599
slap you in the face with CFT and you

1052
00:44:14,838 --> 00:44:18,440
would just be happy no matter what

1053
00:44:16,599 --> 00:44:20,599
because there's something about CFT

1054
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:22,318
compared to any of those other moves

1055
00:44:20,599 --> 00:44:25,480
like like you know Dave was saying it's

1056
00:44:22,318 --> 00:44:28,358
it's just I'm really I'm excited and we

1057
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:30,880
did this in a way because where I would

1058
00:44:28,358 --> 00:44:32,279
I would be blown away if I saw real sift

1059
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:34,160
and someone brings that to the table I

1060
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:36,880
hope they do and I'd be blown away if

1061
00:44:34,159 --> 00:44:39,558
someone does actually turn heads with

1062
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:41,920
flower rosin not that it can't be done

1063
00:44:39,559 --> 00:44:44,599
it's just I think the cultivar has to be

1064
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:46,720
specific the grower has to be specific

1065
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:48,640
um in order to make it happen you know

1066
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:51,279
can I ask this question it might be a

1067
00:44:48,639 --> 00:44:53,239
little little off but this is a good

1068
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:55,160
panel of folks to ask because I'm I'm

1069
00:44:53,239 --> 00:44:59,000
not as experienced in hash as all you

1070
00:44:55,159 --> 00:45:01,239
folks um I'm a grower but uh do you see

1071
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:04,440
difference in in hash made with made

1072
00:45:01,239 --> 00:45:06,039
sensia versus Mia um with seeds you know

1073
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:08,720
I'm breing so I have a lot of pollen

1074
00:45:06,039 --> 00:45:12,119
flying around no

1075
00:45:08,719 --> 00:45:15,759
absolutely it's it's not as good it's

1076
00:45:12,119 --> 00:45:19,640
not as it could still be great but the

1077
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:24,000
turpine levels are the are down by about

1078
00:45:19,639 --> 00:45:27,960
25% or more and the uh canono can be

1079
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:30,599
slightly down and there's less yield for

1080
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:32,280
the plant of course sure because you're

1081
00:45:30,599 --> 00:45:34,920
making

1082
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:36,400
seeds we had we had I had done a bunch I

1083
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:37,960
mean I've been doing a lot of this

1084
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,559
because I have a lot of pollen flying so

1085
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:42,240
it's kind of like only thing I can do is

1086
00:45:39,559 --> 00:45:44,359
to to to make process it that way and it

1087
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:45,919
ends up coming out really good I mean

1088
00:45:44,358 --> 00:45:47,318
compare it's not like the [ __ ] stuff

1089
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:49,240
that you're G to remember for the rest

1090
00:45:47,318 --> 00:45:50,759
of your life but it's good A minus

1091
00:45:49,239 --> 00:45:52,399
quality stuff and I put on the market

1092
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:54,240
and people are you know really happy

1093
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:56,318
about and and I've actually had some

1094
00:45:54,239 --> 00:45:57,959
people come up to me and be be curious

1095
00:45:56,318 --> 00:46:00,079
like you know something extra that's

1096
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:02,800
getting me high in there and that's why

1097
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:04,400
I asked because I smoke so much goddamn

1098
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:07,359
I don't have sense to pet you know you

1099
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:10,920
do understand that all of the important

1100
00:46:07,358 --> 00:46:12,960
sifted hash in the world is from seed

1101
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:14,760
plants right right

1102
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:17,800
right of

1103
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:20,800
course makes sense but those but those

1104
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:24,079
those entries are not generally winning

1105
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:25,800
sure either you know it's my whole brain

1106
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:27,680
has really gotten onto this in the last

1107
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:30,760
like two months I've been thinking a lot

1108
00:46:27,679 --> 00:46:33,399
about hash because I am breeding and

1109
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:37,880
when I have someone process my material

1110
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:39,920
I lose 50% 40% of my work and so I've

1111
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:41,880
been I finally got myself a freeze dryer

1112
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:43,159
and I was like holy [ __ ] it dawned on me

1113
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:45,680
I just what you guys were talking about

1114
00:46:43,159 --> 00:46:47,279
I could store this stuff freeze dried

1115
00:46:45,679 --> 00:46:49,078
and sell it and hold it you know I could

1116
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:51,400
do a big run of this one thing that's

1117
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:53,480
really cool right now and save the whole

1118
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:55,039
thing or half whatever and and 10 years

1119
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:58,800
later open that up and be like yo I got

1120
00:46:55,039 --> 00:46:58,800
some GMO anybody

1121
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:06,480
doing it you know on a bigger level

1122
00:47:04,719 --> 00:47:09,358
where you're bringing in super highend

1123
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:11,240
producers and washers and um being able

1124
00:47:09,358 --> 00:47:14,358
to you know hold it that

1125
00:47:11,239 --> 00:47:16,919
way yeah it's crazy it's it's the where

1126
00:47:14,358 --> 00:47:18,799
it's gone too like just looking at it

1127
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:20,760
from we get the we get the privilege to

1128
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:23,039
visit all these facilities and we're

1129
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:26,200
going into them and and my favorite part

1130
00:47:23,039 --> 00:47:28,039
is when you walk through their setup and

1131
00:47:26,199 --> 00:47:29,838
my second or probably my favorite part

1132
00:47:28,039 --> 00:47:31,400
is when they bring you to the freezer

1133
00:47:29,838 --> 00:47:33,400
and they open that freezer and you're

1134
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:36,838
looking

1135
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:40,358
at400 $500,000 worth of [ __ ] melt

1136
00:47:36,838 --> 00:47:42,199
like jars massive and everyone has this

1137
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:43,558
this is you know and and we joke about

1138
00:47:42,199 --> 00:47:45,919
it we're like oh that's actually where

1139
00:47:43,559 --> 00:47:48,160
their money is it's in that freezer that

1140
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:49,800
they've got stored there but the other

1141
00:47:48,159 --> 00:47:52,399
the other nutty part is when you walk

1142
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:55,160
through their processing areas and I can

1143
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:57,680
sit there and and it's Marcus's you know

1144
00:47:55,159 --> 00:48:00,118
those those kokos those these machines

1145
00:47:57,679 --> 00:48:02,078
these [ __ ] freeze dryers all this new

1146
00:48:00,119 --> 00:48:05,318
equipment that you see wasn't here

1147
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:07,880
before and now it's like finally Nick

1148
00:48:05,318 --> 00:48:10,679
can have dry hash right like you know

1149
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:10,680
it'll be

1150
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:23,000
dry available and uh uh the fact that

1151
00:48:21,159 --> 00:48:24,480
it's not cheap to produce this stuff

1152
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,519
like some of the big stuff at Whistler

1153
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:28,679
Tech is insane you know we're trying to

1154
00:48:26,519 --> 00:48:30,000
get to get us a large machine just to

1155
00:48:28,679 --> 00:48:32,000
have at the event or something you know

1156
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,280
so people can be like what the [ __ ]

1157
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,039
because this thing is gone so far I can

1158
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:38,559
see behind you like the dehydrators it's

1159
00:48:36,039 --> 00:48:42,480
just there's so much that's now here and

1160
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:44,839
present for guys to be able to you know

1161
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:47,400
process and and it's it's I like

1162
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:49,639
California you can have six plants right

1163
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:52,318
you could take those six plants you can

1164
00:48:49,639 --> 00:48:53,798
you can flower that year your six plants

1165
00:48:52,318 --> 00:48:56,318
you could take that flower you could

1166
00:48:53,798 --> 00:48:58,639
sell all of it I always joke that like

1167
00:48:56,318 --> 00:49:01,798
you could move move a you can move a box

1168
00:48:58,639 --> 00:49:03,239
and [ __ ] open a a solventless lab

1169
00:49:01,798 --> 00:49:05,159
well that's that's where that's where my

1170
00:49:03,239 --> 00:49:06,639
brain was going because I'm paying all

1171
00:49:05,159 --> 00:49:08,358
these people to process I'm paying all

1172
00:49:06,639 --> 00:49:10,920
these people and I'm like wait a sec I I

1173
00:49:08,358 --> 00:49:12,920
have you know a couple big 30 by 96 I

1174
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:14,760
run the whole thing by myself and I'm

1175
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:17,000
like I could hire a crew to come in for

1176
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:19,000
five days bring it down and if I got a

1177
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:21,119
big machine like Marcus's or the

1178
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,559
Whistler Tech um I could watch the whole

1179
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:24,318
goddamn thing in three or four days by

1180
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:25,599
myself and then I'm done you know and

1181
00:49:24,318 --> 00:49:26,960
I've wrapped up I saved some for

1182
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:28,760
long-term storage and I can sell a

1183
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:30,519
little bit and move on I was just like

1184
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:33,160
holy [ __ ] dude then you could at least

1185
00:49:30,519 --> 00:49:36,199
you could rent out your machine too

1186
00:49:33,159 --> 00:49:37,879
right once I've seriously put a ton of

1187
00:49:36,199 --> 00:49:41,199
time into this I've just been wanting to

1188
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:43,119
call you on it you know but um it would

1189
00:49:41,199 --> 00:49:44,439
change my game entirely as as a breeder

1190
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:46,200
because then I can just focus on my

1191
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:47,880
plants you know and I can and I can sip

1192
00:49:46,199 --> 00:49:49,759
through everything and melt really easy

1193
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:51,680
and like God damn it I took me a long

1194
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:53,520
time to get here I feel kind of stupid

1195
00:49:51,679 --> 00:49:56,759
because I was

1196
00:49:53,519 --> 00:49:58,159
actually you know but um I just kind

1197
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:00,480
took a break on it for years because of

1198
00:49:58,159 --> 00:50:03,519
it sorry I didn't hear now you can breed

1199
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:05,719
specifically for hash dumping totally

1200
00:50:03,519 --> 00:50:09,519
I'm been working on that yeah for sure

1201
00:50:05,719 --> 00:50:13,399
man and that's you know I think it's not

1202
00:50:09,519 --> 00:50:16,119
so easy but yes it can be done uh

1203
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:18,318
there's a path yeah yeah you have to

1204
00:50:16,119 --> 00:50:21,079
spend the time and and really focus on

1205
00:50:18,318 --> 00:50:23,039
on all the data points and you know just

1206
00:50:21,079 --> 00:50:25,960
where the loss is and isn't through the

1207
00:50:23,039 --> 00:50:27,358
process but it's you know I I I find it

1208
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:30,159
really rewarding and I recommend

1209
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:33,119
everyone to do it um it's something that

1210
00:50:30,159 --> 00:50:35,239
I've found I was a grower first and then

1211
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:38,318
I wanted to make hash like most of of

1212
00:50:35,239 --> 00:50:40,078
you on here and it's you know look you

1213
00:50:38,318 --> 00:50:42,239
you hone in on what's important and to

1214
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:45,640
me it was it was tping profile and yield

1215
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:47,679
and I just knew that if I didn't do that

1216
00:50:45,639 --> 00:50:49,879
I'd just be looking at you know less

1217
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:52,679
than 2% yields all the time and and can

1218
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:56,680
you know always wonder why right

1219
00:50:52,679 --> 00:51:00,078
so with dry sift if you really want just

1220
00:50:56,679 --> 00:51:03,960
your heads you only get about 3% from a

1221
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:07,599
kilo of weed with water you can get you

1222
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:12,440
know 10 maybe even 12 or whatever with

1223
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:15,760
uh rosin you you got a similar number so

1224
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:18,400
I mean economically if you just growing

1225
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:22,400
a few plants you want to make your own

1226
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:25,079
rosin or water has makes more

1227
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:27,880
sense the highest I've ever gotten with

1228
00:51:25,079 --> 00:51:30,720
rosin and water hat is it's close to

1229
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:33,680
30% those are rare but they they did

1230
00:51:30,719 --> 00:51:37,358
happen I did that where is my that's

1231
00:51:33,679 --> 00:51:39,598
tremendous that's CRA it's tremendous

1232
00:51:37,358 --> 00:51:42,598
tremendous get

1233
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:47,119
20% not many people are gonna hit those

1234
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:51,079
numbers no milk four to 5% fresh frozen

1235
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:53,920
like Sam when he was talking um uh three

1236
00:51:51,079 --> 00:51:56,599
uh those low percentages four or five

1237
00:51:53,920 --> 00:52:01,358
percent he's talking fresh frozen which

1238
00:51:56,599 --> 00:52:04,720
four or 5% is like 16 to 20% dry yield

1239
00:52:01,358 --> 00:52:06,400
yep when Sam's saying 3% he's talking

1240
00:52:04,719 --> 00:52:09,919
dry

1241
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:12,838
yield I start with dry plants

1242
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:15,200
correct and I get rid of all the crap

1243
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:18,199
and all the crap and all the crap to

1244
00:52:15,199 --> 00:52:21,000
finally all that's left is little resin

1245
00:52:18,199 --> 00:52:25,318
heads and I never have more than two or

1246
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:28,159
three% yeah makes sense good company

1247
00:52:25,318 --> 00:52:30,639
that's good compy is hard to to

1248
00:52:28,159 --> 00:52:33,078
accomplish all the

1249
00:52:30,639 --> 00:52:35,279
time you know if you're hitting % that's

1250
00:52:33,079 --> 00:52:37,798
a really amazing place to be you know

1251
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:39,599
hone in on on whatever ritols and parent

1252
00:52:37,798 --> 00:52:41,960
stock that's doing that the GMO root

1253
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:43,599
beer man I'm telling you guys this [ __ ]

1254
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:45,159
is [ __ ] fire I'll have test numbers

1255
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:48,559
on all the varieties here in a few days

1256
00:52:45,159 --> 00:52:51,879
but it's taen that for sure so I don't

1257
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:54,480
like GMO players well fair enough they

1258
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:57,760
weird no that's a joke don't you get it

1259
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:59,079
GMO plants

1260
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:00,440
hey since we're since we're talking

1261
00:52:59,079 --> 00:53:03,318
numbers and

1262
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:05,760
yields Kevin and I have been working at

1263
00:53:03,318 --> 00:53:07,519
at uh 800 for the last probably like 18

1264
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:09,839
months selling fresh frozen in the

1265
00:53:07,519 --> 00:53:13,039
market pretty much being a broker to the

1266
00:53:09,838 --> 00:53:17,719
fresh frozen and you know what we saw

1267
00:53:13,039 --> 00:53:20,239
was disappointment sadness anger deceit

1268
00:53:17,719 --> 00:53:22,798
uh you know bad stuff going on you what

1269
00:53:20,239 --> 00:53:25,118
you saw was Farmers that had these

1270
00:53:22,798 --> 00:53:27,280
ingenuitive cats that would come in

1271
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:29,720
logistics guys that would come in with

1272
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:31,720
Reaper trucks and they had the grand old

1273
00:53:29,719 --> 00:53:33,598
idea of you know what uh we're going to

1274
00:53:31,719 --> 00:53:35,239
come in here we can use your staff we're

1275
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:36,920
going to harvest and freeze all this and

1276
00:53:35,239 --> 00:53:38,639
when we freeze it you can get your

1277
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:41,519
Harvest you can get your next grow going

1278
00:53:38,639 --> 00:53:41,519
and we're going to sell it

1279
00:53:46,318 --> 00:53:51,159
all so they kind of duped a lot of the

1280
00:53:48,838 --> 00:53:53,639
farmers into thinking that this was the

1281
00:53:51,159 --> 00:53:55,759
way to do it what happens then is the

1282
00:53:53,639 --> 00:53:57,279
stuff's not selling the reaper truck's

1283
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:59,599
sitting there on the Farmers land at

1284
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:01,480
1,600 bucks a month all the profit

1285
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:03,838
starts to get eaten away and then the

1286
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:06,079
farmers literally has a bunch of [ __ ]

1287
00:54:03,838 --> 00:54:07,558
material that the reaper truck leaves

1288
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:08,760
and they have to either drop the price

1289
00:54:07,559 --> 00:54:10,839
to the point where they didn't make

1290
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:12,839
anything and lost a bunch of money so we

1291
00:54:10,838 --> 00:54:15,199
saw this everywhere we're just like and

1292
00:54:12,838 --> 00:54:18,039
the other thing we saw as hash consumers

1293
00:54:15,199 --> 00:54:21,318
was that it was the same [ __ ] 16 to

1294
00:54:18,039 --> 00:54:23,358
22 strains over and over and over and

1295
00:54:21,318 --> 00:54:25,400
over and then these [ __ ] started to

1296
00:54:23,358 --> 00:54:28,000
[ __ ] us again because they started

1297
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:29,720
taking the same six to 22 strains and

1298
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,239
mixing the Melt and pressing that and

1299
00:54:29,719 --> 00:54:33,919
calling it a modified and making a new

1300
00:54:32,239 --> 00:54:37,199
skew which is good for business but

1301
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:39,159
shitty for my [ __ ] receptors so hey

1302
00:54:37,199 --> 00:54:41,838
Addison hey Addison I gotta ask a

1303
00:54:39,159 --> 00:54:44,318
question so what you say about hashing

1304
00:54:41,838 --> 00:54:46,920
is certainly true I think with cultivars

1305
00:54:44,318 --> 00:54:49,358
but not necessarily extends over to

1306
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:52,079
solvent-based extraction and so as you

1307
00:54:49,358 --> 00:54:54,960
know there's an incredible market for

1308
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:57,280
fresh frozen in for solvent based

1309
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:58,119
extracts especially in I mean just the

1310
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:02,440
way

1311
00:54:58,119 --> 00:55:04,079
that it doesn't really it's most

1312
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:07,318
production is not based on vertical

1313
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:11,079
integration where you have control of

1314
00:55:07,318 --> 00:55:13,400
the grow and certainly if you're making

1315
00:55:11,079 --> 00:55:15,880
if you're making live resin and you're

1316
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:18,760
doing fresh frozen extraction just like

1317
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:21,200
with hash you can't you can't make a

1318
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:23,280
good extract out of bad starting

1319
00:55:21,199 --> 00:55:25,078
material right you could certainly

1320
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:28,039
certainly turn good starting material

1321
00:55:25,079 --> 00:55:32,000
into a bad ract but not the other way

1322
00:55:28,039 --> 00:55:36,319
around so I think that the the pressure

1323
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:39,798
on those Growers now is that you know

1324
00:55:36,318 --> 00:55:43,119
they could easily dump that stuff um

1325
00:55:39,798 --> 00:55:45,719
probably at a much lower cost higher

1326
00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:47,920
volumes to the guys who are just buying

1327
00:55:45,719 --> 00:55:49,959
it and extracting it as much as they

1328
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:52,920
possibly can to make sauce and diamonds

1329
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:54,358
on the solvent side and they and they do

1330
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:56,480
and from what we're talking about within

1331
00:55:54,358 --> 00:55:59,078
that 18-month period we saw that there

1332
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:01,119
was some you know we'll call them Bottom

1333
00:55:59,079 --> 00:56:02,839
Feeders like guys that didn't give a

1334
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:05,079
[ __ ] and they would buy it up but even

1335
00:56:02,838 --> 00:56:07,199
the BHO guys were only getting

1336
00:56:05,079 --> 00:56:09,240
1.8% so you're talking about [ __ ]

1337
00:56:07,199 --> 00:56:12,558
material and what it was was now this

1338
00:56:09,239 --> 00:56:13,959
system was concentrating [ __ ] material

1339
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:15,400
that was then trying to be sold in the

1340
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:18,039
market so we looked at that and we're

1341
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:19,880
like this is kind of [ __ ] up we're

1342
00:56:18,039 --> 00:56:22,280
lucky enough that a lot lot of our

1343
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:23,599
friends are big breeders so we would go

1344
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:25,519
and be with our buddies and we'd be

1345
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:27,480
smoking hash and they would have this

1346
00:56:25,519 --> 00:56:29,679
[ __ ] strain or something and they'd

1347
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:31,079
be like oh this is my blah blah blah and

1348
00:56:29,679 --> 00:56:32,759
we'd be like well how come this isn't in

1349
00:56:31,079 --> 00:56:35,160
the hash market and this happened

1350
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:37,640
multiple times oh well you know I put it

1351
00:56:35,159 --> 00:56:39,078
out and 710 grabbed it and they do it in

1352
00:56:37,639 --> 00:56:40,759
like limited runs but that's like the

1353
00:56:39,079 --> 00:56:42,519
only big you know guy that grabbed it

1354
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:44,280
and it's out there and we were just like

1355
00:56:42,519 --> 00:56:47,119
what the [ __ ] is wrong with you and then

1356
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:50,280
we realized oh you're a breeder not a

1357
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:52,000
marketer you're a breeder not a this

1358
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:54,319
you're a breeder not of that and so your

1359
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,480
focus is to breed to just be in there

1360
00:56:54,318 --> 00:56:59,000
making genetics and and love your life

1361
00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:00,760
in that place and so we were like okay

1362
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,920
it's our job to now figure out how to

1363
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:05,839
fix this so we went to those breeders

1364
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:09,358
and said listen I've got a network of a

1365
00:57:05,838 --> 00:57:11,440
hundred you know of uh 36 40 something

1366
00:57:09,358 --> 00:57:13,199
Farms that are going to be able to

1367
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:15,280
produce this you know these specific

1368
00:57:13,199 --> 00:57:17,719
cultivars that you have that are hash

1369
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:19,599
specific solventless specific we can get

1370
00:57:17,719 --> 00:57:21,159
those into production if we get them

1371
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:22,680
into the washrooms and we can help

1372
00:57:21,159 --> 00:57:25,000
popularize the strains would you be

1373
00:57:22,679 --> 00:57:26,279
willing to just take these genetics

1374
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,400
whatever you have that you think are

1375
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:30,519
right and give them to us and we'll make

1376
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:32,240
sure that your name is you know

1377
00:57:30,519 --> 00:57:33,920
recognized the whole time and that

1378
00:57:32,239 --> 00:57:36,318
there's Integrity in what we do with the

1379
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:38,358
with the Farms that we work with so we

1380
00:57:36,318 --> 00:57:40,279
got breeders to agree to that we then

1381
00:57:38,358 --> 00:57:43,279
went and we know we knew that we needed

1382
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:45,319
a a an actual Nursery so we went and

1383
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:47,359
found a nursery we have about right now

1384
00:57:45,318 --> 00:57:51,079
we have seven or eight breeders we got

1385
00:57:47,358 --> 00:57:52,838
about 40 45 or 46 strains that are all

1386
00:57:51,079 --> 00:57:55,280
brand new for solventless hash according

1387
00:57:52,838 --> 00:57:58,239
to the breeder and they're all producing

1388
00:57:55,280 --> 00:58:01,039
at least at four % for solventless

1389
00:57:58,239 --> 00:58:03,919
production so that's kind of the that it

1390
00:58:01,039 --> 00:58:07,079
has to produce at least 15% THC dried

1391
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:09,639
weight and it has to be at least a 4% to

1392
00:58:07,079 --> 00:58:11,720
get into pipeline as a brand new strain

1393
00:58:09,639 --> 00:58:14,598
that's going to come in from a breeder

1394
00:58:11,719 --> 00:58:17,558
now what we did was we also realized

1395
00:58:14,599 --> 00:58:20,318
that we had to figure out how to take

1396
00:58:17,559 --> 00:58:22,160
the plant material from the farm within

1397
00:58:20,318 --> 00:58:24,798
the farmer's model and what he's doing

1398
00:58:22,159 --> 00:58:27,719
in harvesting so the farmer knows when

1399
00:58:24,798 --> 00:58:29,880
it's ready pulls it starts to dry it and

1400
00:58:27,719 --> 00:58:32,318
cures it that's what they do what we did

1401
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:36,358
was built a system that fits into their

1402
00:58:32,318 --> 00:58:38,239
model and allows us to take a test wash

1403
00:58:36,358 --> 00:58:40,199
at the right time specifically at the

1404
00:58:38,239 --> 00:58:42,519
right time we have a network of buyers

1405
00:58:40,199 --> 00:58:45,679
that we're already shopping the list of

1406
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:47,639
strains to and the the harvest dates

1407
00:58:45,679 --> 00:58:49,639
once we do that the guys that are that

1408
00:58:47,639 --> 00:58:52,000
are buying they can look at that list

1409
00:58:49,639 --> 00:58:53,519
based on strains or cultivars and say oh

1410
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,679
these are coming down on these dates let

1411
00:58:53,519 --> 00:58:57,280
me set up my test washes on that date

1412
00:58:55,679 --> 00:58:59,399
and we've been doing this over the last

1413
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:02,039
two months and orchestrating this and

1414
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:05,119
it's been perfect the test washes so if

1415
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:06,920
we have a lab that test washes with us

1416
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:08,798
if they like the product they get first

1417
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:11,079
right to refuse it so we're moving

1418
00:59:08,798 --> 00:59:13,719
through 2,000 3,000 pounds of material

1419
00:59:11,079 --> 00:59:15,839
at a time the farmers stoked because

1420
00:59:13,719 --> 00:59:18,439
we're like hey pull the leaves 12 hours

1421
00:59:15,838 --> 00:59:20,358
before then come in apply this this pull

1422
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:22,000
you know this Harvest bucking method

1423
00:59:20,358 --> 00:59:24,199
make sure that they're frozen and stored

1424
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:27,798
this way so this whole entire thing is

1425
00:59:24,199 --> 00:59:30,199
all done specifically for the process

1426
00:59:27,798 --> 00:59:32,920
because now if we do it that way we can

1427
00:59:30,199 --> 00:59:34,960
advertise to the B to the makers hey we

1428
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:36,639
followed all these protocols and Sops

1429
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:38,880
we're using these strains here's the

1430
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:41,318
Harvest dates and this thing is knocking

1431
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:43,400
off now doing so well that we already

1432
00:59:41,318 --> 00:59:45,719
have guys that we went to and pitched it

1433
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:47,838
to that were so stoned that they came

1434
00:59:45,719 --> 00:59:50,879
back and pitched it to us which I think

1435
00:59:47,838 --> 00:59:52,759
is awesome and you know we had to remind

1436
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:54,760
them that look we built this in a way

1437
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:56,520
where you can't really do this without

1438
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:57,880
the relationship with the Breeders

1439
00:59:56,519 --> 00:59:59,838
without a relationship with a really

1440
00:59:57,880 --> 01:00:01,680
great Nursery that you can trust and

1441
00:59:59,838 --> 01:00:02,960
without the relationship then with

1442
01:00:01,679 --> 01:00:05,118
existing makers that you're already

1443
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:06,519
selling material to and a lot of these

1444
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:08,440
guys that are trying to copy us are the

1445
01:00:06,519 --> 01:00:10,880
guys the logistics guys that came in and

1446
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:13,000
[ __ ] everybody the last couple years

1447
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:15,318
um so we just like we approach it with

1448
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:17,838
loving kindness we approach it with

1449
01:00:15,318 --> 01:00:20,400
logic and we just look at it and say

1450
01:00:17,838 --> 01:00:22,239
very selfishly how the [ __ ] do we make

1451
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:25,160
it so that there's better strains for us

1452
01:00:22,239 --> 01:00:27,199
to smoke Ash that was really the selfish

1453
01:00:25,159 --> 01:00:30,960
approach to it and then we figured it

1454
01:00:27,199 --> 01:00:36,318
would there clear you're talking about

1455
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:39,760
clones yes not seeds seeds seeds from

1456
01:00:36,318 --> 01:00:43,759
seed well there's got to be variation

1457
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:45,319
every got to be yeah there will be so

1458
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:47,640
that's why the nursery partner that we

1459
01:00:45,318 --> 01:00:50,400
have we selected a very specific Nursery

1460
01:00:47,639 --> 01:00:52,199
partner that's very good at propagation

1461
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:54,798
and very good at communication so we can

1462
01:00:52,199 --> 01:00:56,679
have them work directly with the breeder

1463
01:00:54,798 --> 01:00:58,199
that bred it and help them understand

1464
01:00:56,679 --> 01:01:00,759
what characteristics they're looking for

1465
01:00:58,199 --> 01:01:02,919
through the process and that's that it

1466
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:05,280
took a long time it took a lot of

1467
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:07,400
looking but we did find a partner that's

1468
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:10,200
willing to take the genetics but then we

1469
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:12,639
also have a very rich uh scene in

1470
01:01:10,199 --> 01:01:14,598
California with tissue culture so we

1471
01:01:12,639 --> 01:01:16,719
have access to the genetics in Clone

1472
01:01:14,599 --> 01:01:19,480
form that we can tissue culture and

1473
01:01:16,719 --> 01:01:21,519
bring those labts in and be able to also

1474
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:24,079
uh then use the specific strain that the

1475
01:01:21,519 --> 01:01:27,199
breeder talking about the actual one

1476
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:29,839
that they selected um but it's also fun

1477
01:01:27,199 --> 01:01:31,399
for the for the the nursery to be able

1478
01:01:29,838 --> 01:01:33,599
to get in there and open it up and see

1479
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:36,039
because they may see one that's a great

1480
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:37,920
flower version they may see one that's a

1481
01:01:36,039 --> 01:01:39,440
great hash version and that's why we

1482
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:40,920
want to start defining things

1483
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:44,599
differently that

1484
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:47,519
way I I I'm in favor of colonal

1485
01:01:44,599 --> 01:01:50,079
production I mean I I'm a seed guy that

1486
01:01:47,519 --> 01:01:53,000
that's honest truth but what I do is I

1487
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:55,599
grow thousands of seeds to select out

1488
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:58,519
the one or two that I want to clone yeah

1489
01:01:55,599 --> 01:02:03,278
yeah so you know I I don't use clones

1490
01:01:58,519 --> 01:02:05,318
for production per se I oh clones clones

1491
01:02:03,278 --> 01:02:08,119
are the way not seedlings because

1492
01:02:05,318 --> 01:02:10,038
seedlings are just too variable and uh

1493
01:02:08,119 --> 01:02:12,160
that's both good and bad for the reason

1494
01:02:10,039 --> 01:02:13,960
you're saying but uh when you're

1495
01:02:12,159 --> 01:02:16,598
producing a product you don't really

1496
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:18,599
want variability you want it to be

1497
01:02:16,599 --> 01:02:20,400
consistent yeah and that's why we have

1498
01:02:18,599 --> 01:02:23,200
the cult the the guys that we're working

1499
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:24,920
with at the nursery they're very good at

1500
01:02:23,199 --> 01:02:26,679
doing selection they've done they do

1501
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:28,920
selection with compound they do

1502
01:02:26,679 --> 01:02:30,399
selection with some really big guys and

1503
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:32,519
they they've got an eye for it they know

1504
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:34,119
what they're doing and they they they

1505
01:02:32,519 --> 01:02:37,159
tend to be able to lean a little more

1506
01:02:34,119 --> 01:02:39,079
toward hash as well so we figure some of

1507
01:02:37,159 --> 01:02:40,519
it will come through in Clone form you

1508
01:02:39,079 --> 01:02:42,440
know because some of it's rare you know

1509
01:02:40,519 --> 01:02:44,798
it's they don't have it in seed form yet

1510
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:48,278
or they haven't produced it that

1511
01:02:44,798 --> 01:02:51,920
way but we just we we look at it as uh

1512
01:02:48,278 --> 01:02:54,079
if we're able to give these great guys

1513
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:56,599
at the nursery these great Growers the

1514
01:02:54,079 --> 01:02:59,680
ability to pop the beans and find what's

1515
01:02:56,599 --> 01:03:01,640
in there um then we're it's a good start

1516
01:02:59,679 --> 01:03:04,000
at least it's going to give us a strin

1517
01:03:01,639 --> 01:03:06,159
or a cul ofar that we can narrow down on

1518
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:08,358
and run test washed and hey if the test

1519
01:03:06,159 --> 01:03:11,078
washed come back and it's at five six

1520
01:03:08,358 --> 01:03:12,639
seven percent we got a winner what's

1521
01:03:11,079 --> 01:03:15,880
crazy about what's going on now that

1522
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:19,440
we're seeing we we just watched Taylor f

1523
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:20,880
tasel um we watched him you know start a

1524
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:23,200
brand new seed company he's been working

1525
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:25,400
on for the last two and a half years and

1526
01:03:23,199 --> 01:03:27,159
out of the seeds that he bred he started

1527
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:28,920
to put out test batches that went out

1528
01:03:27,159 --> 01:03:30,639
that are now coming back and and guys

1529
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:33,119
have had time to mess with them there's

1530
01:03:30,639 --> 01:03:34,000
one of them called twins um which is

1531
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:39,079
fully

1532
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:39,079
purple uh you know coming out at%

1533
01:03:44,719 --> 01:03:49,519
yield doing these what he's doing is

1534
01:03:47,079 --> 01:03:53,440
he's making crosses with his shallot

1535
01:03:49,519 --> 01:03:56,079
shashimi and his fana and both of those

1536
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:59,039
are Bas base as what he's using for

1537
01:03:56,079 --> 01:04:02,240
progenitors for hash breeding the shalot

1538
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:04,440
shashimi is a GMO cross the fofana is a

1539
01:04:02,239 --> 01:04:07,038
banana cross which are both you know

1540
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:10,119
well known for dumping heavy heavy snow

1541
01:04:07,039 --> 01:04:12,039
um so what he did was is created cross

1542
01:04:10,119 --> 01:04:15,119
crossbreed and created some versions of

1543
01:04:12,039 --> 01:04:17,119
those that he then bred in and did what

1544
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:19,920
you're saying you know did a thousand

1545
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:22,119
crosses it's not so it's not so easy

1546
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:24,639
believe me I've been breeding for resin

1547
01:04:22,119 --> 01:04:27,599
longer than anybody I know but for

1548
01:04:24,639 --> 01:04:30,879
example two two of the easiest ones to

1549
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:35,160
drop resin after you dried the plants is

1550
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:38,920
SLE stack from DNA boys oh yeah and uh

1551
01:04:35,159 --> 01:04:40,879
skunk number one from me I made a hybrid

1552
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:44,159
between the two in fact I made a bunch

1553
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:45,640
of them and none of them dropped resin

1554
01:04:44,159 --> 01:04:49,759
as

1555
01:04:45,639 --> 01:04:49,759
easy it goes

1556
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:04,838
but it takes so long for those guys to

1557
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:06,798
be able to put stuff out sometimes what

1558
01:05:04,838 --> 01:05:08,880
we're trying to do is accelerate that

1559
01:05:06,798 --> 01:05:10,400
process by getting a lot you know this

1560
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:11,760
Nursery that we're talking about this

1561
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:14,519
group that we're talking about they're

1562
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:17,720
$150 million company but they're owned

1563
01:05:14,519 --> 01:05:20,239
by a Mendo grower a single guy that's a

1564
01:05:17,719 --> 01:05:22,358
Mendo grower that that you can hang out

1565
01:05:20,239 --> 01:05:25,000
with and talk with and he's and he's

1566
01:05:22,358 --> 01:05:26,798
also a generational strawberry and

1567
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:29,278
tomato Farm

1568
01:05:26,798 --> 01:05:31,920
so what this guy's able to do what I've

1569
01:05:29,278 --> 01:05:34,239
seen in terms of quality control on a

1570
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:35,680
large scale you know understanding what

1571
01:05:34,239 --> 01:05:37,558
steep hill and quality control and

1572
01:05:35,679 --> 01:05:39,879
testing what this guy's able to do I've

1573
01:05:37,559 --> 01:05:42,920
never seen anyone do I've seen him was

1574
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:44,838
he a strawberry grower or a strawberry

1575
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:48,039
breeder he was

1576
01:05:44,838 --> 01:05:49,358
a strawberry uh grower with with

1577
01:05:48,039 --> 01:05:51,039
generational family members that were

1578
01:05:49,358 --> 01:05:52,838
breeders of both tomatoes and

1579
01:05:51,039 --> 01:05:55,720
strawberries yeah because strawberries

1580
01:05:52,838 --> 01:05:58,759
are so similar to cannabis with

1581
01:05:55,719 --> 01:06:00,159
strawberries you start at 20,000 seeds

1582
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:05,039
or

1583
01:06:00,159 --> 01:06:06,798
more the maybe the 10 best for whatever

1584
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:11,000
criteria that you're interested in

1585
01:06:06,798 --> 01:06:13,559
selecting for and then you uh use that

1586
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:16,039
both selections maybe to breed one step

1587
01:06:13,559 --> 01:06:18,519
further then what you do is you make

1588
01:06:16,039 --> 01:06:19,880
Runners you basically clone it and

1589
01:06:18,519 --> 01:06:23,480
that's what you deliver to the

1590
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:26,720
strawberry Farmers the runners the

1591
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:28,599
Clones yeah he's he's uh this guy's very

1592
01:06:26,719 --> 01:06:30,318
impressive man we we were pretty

1593
01:06:28,599 --> 01:06:32,440
selective on who we would even work with

1594
01:06:30,318 --> 01:06:35,079
and we work we were looking with and

1595
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:37,079
talking with a number of big nurseries

1596
01:06:35,079 --> 01:06:39,880
and what we like about him is that he

1597
01:06:37,079 --> 01:06:41,960
owns the whole thing himself he has one

1598
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:43,960
partner who's a big Tech guy that

1599
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:45,838
handles a lot of the tech end of

1600
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:48,318
everything and then Tristan handles all

1601
01:06:45,838 --> 01:06:50,558
of the grow um we've met his entire

1602
01:06:48,318 --> 01:06:53,318
staff we love the vibe of everyone so we

1603
01:06:50,559 --> 01:06:55,880
trust them um and and the idea again is

1604
01:06:53,318 --> 01:06:56,960
to get them to put them in a position

1605
01:06:55,880 --> 01:06:58,480
where they're in a well enough

1606
01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:00,760
relationship with the Breeders and

1607
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:02,400
pipeline that were able to get that

1608
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:03,640
information to them and do some

1609
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:05,680
selection and get to see what that

1610
01:07:03,639 --> 01:07:07,920
selection delivers but we also have a

1611
01:07:05,679 --> 01:07:09,440
lot of clones that have come from the

1612
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:11,720
Breeders as well that have gone into

1613
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:14,880
tissue culture and we have labts of

1614
01:07:11,719 --> 01:07:16,598
those in original format that are proven

1615
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:18,318
uh for genetic stuff that they've done a

1616
01:07:16,599 --> 01:07:20,400
lot of these guys they breed stuff and

1617
01:07:18,318 --> 01:07:21,880
they don't put it out it only stays to

1618
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:24,039
themselves or in their small circle so

1619
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:26,240
we've got them to give us the Clones now

1620
01:07:24,039 --> 01:07:29,359
and we can start pop popularizing their

1621
01:07:26,239 --> 01:07:30,798
genetics if they're hash dumpers um and

1622
01:07:29,358 --> 01:07:32,798
it's working it's actually doing really

1623
01:07:30,798 --> 01:07:34,318
well it's in phase one now what we've

1624
01:07:32,798 --> 01:07:35,960
done in phase one is we've gone to the

1625
01:07:34,318 --> 01:07:39,000
farm and the nursery that we're working

1626
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:42,240
with we as hash guys have reviewed their

1627
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:44,159
lists of genetics that they have um and

1628
01:07:42,239 --> 01:07:46,078
also recognize that they work with some

1629
01:07:44,159 --> 01:07:48,078
really big breeders in the state they're

1630
01:07:46,079 --> 01:07:49,400
very close with compound uh they're

1631
01:07:48,079 --> 01:07:51,400
really close with a couple other guys so

1632
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:53,680
we know that they're uh they're they're

1633
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:55,240
in it they know what they're doing and

1634
01:07:53,679 --> 01:07:57,519
phase one is to look at the genetics

1635
01:07:55,239 --> 01:07:59,278
that have and we're starting to do that

1636
01:07:57,519 --> 01:08:01,159
Harvest scheduling based on the genetics

1637
01:07:59,278 --> 01:08:03,000
that they have and we found some you

1638
01:08:01,159 --> 01:08:05,318
know we just found some really amazing

1639
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:07,920
Grease Monkey we just found some really

1640
01:08:05,318 --> 01:08:10,920
great Sunday driver uh and what I mean

1641
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:12,920
by found is we are able to get a hold of

1642
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:15,200
the plant we're able to do a test wash

1643
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:18,880
on it that Sunday driver came back I

1644
01:08:15,199 --> 01:08:23,119
think at um four four and a half

1645
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:26,319
4.48% the the Sunday driver um the

1646
01:08:23,119 --> 01:08:28,719
Grease Monkey was it gree monkey was 4.4

1647
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:30,480
and the Sunday driver was uh

1648
01:08:28,719 --> 01:08:33,920
3.8%

1649
01:08:30,479 --> 01:08:36,318
so those are gravimetric isolated yields

1650
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:38,319
of hash you're talking about correct

1651
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:41,480
that's a fresh frozen yeah so from fresh

1652
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:44,960
Frozen um to the dried the dried

1653
01:08:41,479 --> 01:08:47,919
material so so what what would those if

1654
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:51,679
you if you tested those plants and got a

1655
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:53,399
COA based on on dried uh plant material

1656
01:08:51,679 --> 01:08:55,960
what what would they analyze for in

1657
01:08:53,399 --> 01:08:58,838
terms of total canono

1658
01:08:55,960 --> 01:09:01,198
content and the dry weight of uh for

1659
01:08:58,838 --> 01:09:03,719
most stuff here in California the

1660
01:09:01,198 --> 01:09:05,838
highest you ever see is maybe up to 20

1661
01:09:03,719 --> 01:09:07,960
you know uh in a concentrate or in a

1662
01:09:05,838 --> 01:09:09,798
flower yeah no I'm just trying to

1663
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:12,439
qualify like the potency of that

1664
01:09:09,798 --> 01:09:16,359
material versus what you would normally

1665
01:09:12,439 --> 01:09:18,479
see on a COA for dried

1666
01:09:16,359 --> 01:09:20,480
flour oh it's going to be you know the

1667
01:09:18,479 --> 01:09:22,000
dried flour like we said is roughly most

1668
01:09:20,479 --> 01:09:25,959
of the time in California you're about

1669
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:28,560
15 to 22% THC realistically a lot of

1670
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:31,239
guys here like to take thca

1671
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:34,400
THC and some other THC and add it up and

1672
01:09:31,238 --> 01:09:37,639
say that their stuff is 30% THC which is

1673
01:09:34,399 --> 01:09:41,318
total [ __ ] I mean in my wait wait

1674
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:46,079
you can have cannabis that's 30% TC you

1675
01:09:41,319 --> 01:09:48,920
absolutely can Delta 9 THC absolutely

1676
01:09:46,079 --> 01:09:51,439
especially the acid especially the acid

1677
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:52,920
form because it's a little bit heavier

1678
01:09:51,439 --> 01:09:56,079
you're talking about thca you're not

1679
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:59,880
talking about THC

1680
01:09:56,079 --> 01:10:01,359
Del either and or I've looked at more ta

1681
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:03,119
I've looked at more Cannabis Testing

1682
01:10:01,359 --> 01:10:05,679
data than any other person in the United

1683
01:10:03,119 --> 01:10:09,559
States easily I've looked at more I

1684
01:10:05,679 --> 01:10:12,640
honestly I have my doubts because sced

1685
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:16,800
through more than anybody

1686
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:20,159
else I've had my own lab for the last 30

1687
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:23,239
plus years how many samp have you run

1688
01:10:20,158 --> 01:10:25,439
thousands and thousands we were breeders

1689
01:10:23,238 --> 01:10:29,439
we've done at Steep Hill in one year

1690
01:10:25,439 --> 01:10:34,000
we've done over I'd say 150,000

1691
01:10:29,439 --> 01:10:36,399
runs and at one location who's doing the

1692
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:40,760
analysis for you

1693
01:10:36,399 --> 01:10:47,039
150,000 um the final analysis Paul

1694
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:47,039
Daly and what lab is that that's Steep

1695
01:10:48,679 --> 01:10:53,279
Hill so when it comes to data I've

1696
01:10:51,079 --> 01:10:55,519
looked at the data I've seen it you're

1697
01:10:53,279 --> 01:10:58,639
telling me now that if I had a grand of

1698
01:10:55,520 --> 01:11:01,400
that dried flour in my hand 30% of that

1699
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:04,560
gram in dried flour in my hand is pure

1700
01:11:01,399 --> 01:11:07,759
THC well actually the highest that I've

1701
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:11,800
ever run in myself was

1702
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:17,320
29.6 of dried of Delta 9 THC dried

1703
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:22,039
material and it was a Delta 9 THC not

1704
01:11:17,319 --> 01:11:26,960
thca because I ran it on my DC yeah 30

1705
01:11:22,039 --> 01:11:28,760
30% THC would equate to

1706
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:32,039
38.5%

1707
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:34,400
thca and yeah I I call I call [ __ ]

1708
01:11:32,039 --> 01:11:36,560
on that you can't have plant material I

1709
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:38,920
mean if you're if you're plucking the

1710
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:41,560
top of your of your colas and you're

1711
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:43,800
testing nothing else and there's no

1712
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:46,360
other stem material in there because any

1713
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:48,920
non-t trcom producing material is going

1714
01:11:46,359 --> 01:11:51,439
to dilute that but in a typical biomass

1715
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:53,279
sample what you would do is you would an

1716
01:11:51,439 --> 01:11:55,039
at knows this because I'm sure he sees

1717
01:11:53,279 --> 01:11:57,800
this all the time and this purchasing is

1718
01:11:55,039 --> 01:12:00,560
that there are sampling protocols for

1719
01:11:57,800 --> 01:12:04,600
basically sampling large sums of

1720
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:09,080
cannabis for uh an accurate COA that

1721
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:10,800
then atn's price on that material is B I

1722
01:12:09,079 --> 01:12:13,519
understand all of this Mark I've been

1723
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:16,639
doing this a really long time I know but

1724
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:19,280
what we did was we used a sample that

1725
01:12:16,639 --> 01:12:23,119
was heavily manicured the way it would

1726
01:12:19,279 --> 01:12:27,079
be as a consumer would smoke so we

1727
01:12:23,119 --> 01:12:28,800
wasn't unmanicured it was very manicured

1728
01:12:27,079 --> 01:12:32,880
but it was

1729
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:35,360
29.6% THC I just know that is that is

1730
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:37,199
rare Sam and I have to say we are not

1731
01:12:35,359 --> 01:12:39,559
seeing anything like that that's why I'm

1732
01:12:37,198 --> 01:12:42,119
mentioning it no no no I understand it's

1733
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:47,120
the highest I've ever seen most of mine

1734
01:12:42,119 --> 01:12:49,479
was in the range of 22 25 was high yeah

1735
01:12:47,119 --> 01:12:51,198
for you I would say I would I I you

1736
01:12:49,479 --> 01:12:53,799
would probably be the only one but for

1737
01:12:51,198 --> 01:12:56,359
us on the ground in the market we do not

1738
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:59,079
see that here on the ground we have not

1739
01:12:56,359 --> 01:13:01,880
never never seen close to that we have

1740
01:12:59,079 --> 01:13:05,158
people come up and say that we've seen

1741
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:09,000
Laboratories that aren't reputable spike

1742
01:13:05,158 --> 01:13:10,879
samples in that we even saw in the

1743
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:13,520
categories when I did the emerald cup

1744
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:16,480
how they were actually mixing in the

1745
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:18,960
live rosin Etc to try to spike the

1746
01:13:16,479 --> 01:13:21,879
numbers so they hit certain THC ranges

1747
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:24,439
so it is happening there's manipulation

1748
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:26,880
in the scene but at the same time I just

1749
01:13:24,439 --> 01:13:29,439
got to give a shout out Addison proud of

1750
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:31,159
you really proud of you because uh

1751
01:13:29,439 --> 01:13:33,319
you're one of the ogs in the sense of

1752
01:13:31,158 --> 01:13:34,439
what California for those who don't know

1753
01:13:33,319 --> 01:13:36,920
Addison had one of the early

1754
01:13:34,439 --> 01:13:39,879
dispensaries got busted fought the

1755
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:42,800
system started Steep Hill Laboratories

1756
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:45,000
and has just stayed in and stayed true

1757
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:47,719
because I worked with him back in 07 and

1758
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:50,600
'08 actually on the original testing

1759
01:13:47,719 --> 01:13:53,000
here in the United States so much love

1760
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:55,400
great respect and I I don't see it as a

1761
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:59,198
pissing contest between you guys number

1762
01:13:55,399 --> 01:14:02,638
wise it's just you've seen rare air Sam

1763
01:13:59,198 --> 01:14:04,479
and we on the ground do not see re

1764
01:14:02,639 --> 01:14:07,679
anything close that rir we're lucky to

1765
01:14:04,479 --> 01:14:08,839
see the 20% besides the 22 to 25 you

1766
01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:11,600
know what I'm saying that's more common

1767
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:14,520
to see in the under 20 then you're gonna

1768
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:17,239
see anything over 20 unless I'm mistaken

1769
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:19,239
Addison yeah when I tested all the

1770
01:14:17,238 --> 01:14:22,000
samples that were entered into the High

1771
01:14:19,238 --> 01:14:25,279
Times Cannabis Cup here in the

1772
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:29,000
Netherlands which I did each year uh

1773
01:14:25,279 --> 01:14:33,559
yeah they they sell them were 20

1774
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:37,279
22 maybe one or two were 25 maybe but uh

1775
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:40,280
they there was no uh 29.6 ones there

1776
01:14:37,279 --> 01:14:44,039
what varietal was that

1777
01:14:40,279 --> 01:14:44,039
29% and it just

1778
01:14:44,359 --> 01:14:53,359
[ __ ] M [ __ ] yep that's the

1779
01:14:49,039 --> 01:14:55,639
word you know what wow you know what ATN

1780
01:14:53,359 --> 01:14:57,439
when we first when we first started and

1781
01:14:55,639 --> 01:14:59,199
and we first got into everything we

1782
01:14:57,439 --> 01:15:01,960
learned pretty quickly that Sigma

1783
01:14:59,198 --> 01:15:04,319
aldrich's standards are trash and that

1784
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:06,319
they weren't correct um and here's you

1785
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:08,759
know Sigma [ __ ] Aldrich right you're

1786
01:15:06,319 --> 01:15:11,158
like come on and then when you got it's

1787
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:15,199
not only Sigma Aldrich it's

1788
01:15:11,158 --> 01:15:18,039
also if you if you order theyy them they

1789
01:15:15,198 --> 01:15:19,519
buy them so they they Sigma Aldrich is

1790
01:15:18,039 --> 01:15:20,960
just a middleman they don't make

1791
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:23,440
anything they just have a chemical

1792
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:25,600
warehouse and Shuffle around one

1793
01:15:23,439 --> 01:15:27,799
purchase order from one uh client to

1794
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:30,239
another so you're buying basically the

1795
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:32,800
quality of what Cayman and other people

1796
01:15:30,238 --> 01:15:35,399
are able to produce yeah Addison that's

1797
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:37,800
not a problem today I mean as you know

1798
01:15:35,399 --> 01:15:39,960
you need a DEA license to basically

1799
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:42,400
delve out those standards so those

1800
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:44,880
standards cost an awful lot of money

1801
01:15:42,399 --> 01:15:47,399
they do end up spoiling especially the

1802
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:49,239
cannaboid acid standards they only good

1803
01:15:47,399 --> 01:15:50,638
for like I don't know I think they're

1804
01:15:49,238 --> 01:15:55,599
good for just a couple months and you

1805
01:15:50,639 --> 01:15:55,600
have to keep them Frozen but

1806
01:16:01,439 --> 01:16:06,919
we're not handling nuclear waste we're

1807
01:16:03,359 --> 01:16:10,719
just handling pure compounds here so

1808
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:13,719
it but it's an unnecessary tax just like

1809
01:16:10,719 --> 01:16:17,079
the tax on 200 proof ethanol that

1810
01:16:13,719 --> 01:16:19,039
handicaps the industry just like 280e

1811
01:16:17,079 --> 01:16:21,679
and all the other [ __ ] right you are

1812
01:16:19,039 --> 01:16:24,039
correct about the problem with getting

1813
01:16:21,679 --> 01:16:26,719
analytical samples when we set up our

1814
01:16:24,039 --> 01:16:29,719
lab 30 years years ago what we did was

1815
01:16:26,719 --> 01:16:32,560
we got our standards both from Geneva

1816
01:16:29,719 --> 01:16:36,158
United Nations drugs and we got them

1817
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:39,560
from uh Sigma also and one other place I

1818
01:16:36,158 --> 01:16:43,279
forget but what we did was we sent the

1819
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:48,239
sample to Dr mum we sent the sample to

1820
01:16:43,279 --> 01:16:50,679
Dr bran Eisen and Dr El solle and all

1821
01:16:48,238 --> 01:16:54,079
four of our results came back we felt

1822
01:16:50,679 --> 01:16:55,960
pretty good except for that the results

1823
01:16:54,079 --> 01:16:59,439
were

1824
01:16:55,960 --> 01:17:02,920
88% instead of

1825
01:16:59,439 --> 01:17:04,238
99 hey Sam just turn Sam just turn away

1826
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:06,840
from your mic slightly you're you're

1827
01:17:04,238 --> 01:17:07,519
breathing directly into your mic okay

1828
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:10,400
I'm

1829
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:11,520
sorry yeah it's interesting how we we

1830
01:17:10,399 --> 01:17:13,158
eventually got to the point where we

1831
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:15,360
were just making standards because we

1832
01:17:13,158 --> 01:17:17,759
couldn't trust um what we were getting

1833
01:17:15,359 --> 01:17:19,319
we were just using a preparative hplc

1834
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:22,400
and just making our own [ __ ] at that

1835
01:17:19,319 --> 01:17:24,559
point um what's funny is Sigma Aldrich

1836
01:17:22,399 --> 01:17:27,279
is one of the best places to buy LSD

1837
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:29,400
from so if you go to Sigma Aldrich you

1838
01:17:27,279 --> 01:17:31,439
can get their standard for LSD and just

1839
01:17:29,399 --> 01:17:32,879
eat it and get lit it's actually a

1840
01:17:31,439 --> 01:17:36,238
really [ __ ] cool trick that you can

1841
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:39,039
pull so anybody who has access Sigma

1842
01:17:36,238 --> 01:17:42,799
Aldrich has some pretty dope

1843
01:17:39,039 --> 01:17:44,920
LSD I speak from you gotta fill out a

1844
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:47,199
pretty extensive questionnaire before

1845
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:49,760
you get an account with Sigma Aldridge

1846
01:17:47,198 --> 01:17:52,000
to make sure that you know you're

1847
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:54,400
licensed to handle anything that you get

1848
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:57,520
from them and if they smell anything

1849
01:17:54,399 --> 01:17:59,920
fishy you can't buy from Sig Aldridge

1850
01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:01,840
but there's plenty of chemical vendors I

1851
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:04,480
mean you can go up to Amazon these days

1852
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:06,560
and buy chemicals so I mean there's lots

1853
01:18:04,479 --> 01:18:10,439
of places that you can buy you know

1854
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:13,280
stuff from also stands Sigma sold me

1855
01:18:10,439 --> 01:18:14,519
with no problem so they ate that clever

1856
01:18:13,279 --> 01:18:15,599
yeah they sold the Steep Hill we didn't

1857
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:17,679
know what the [ __ ] we were doing in the

1858
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:19,440
beginning yeah now they're they they

1859
01:18:17,679 --> 01:18:22,560
they're they're pretty careful I I've

1860
01:18:19,439 --> 01:18:25,519
had to I've had to get reapproved and

1861
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:27,320
approved and reapproved again with

1862
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:30,159
yeah well you're on a special list Mark

1863
01:18:27,319 --> 01:18:32,439
let's be honest yeah exactly there

1864
01:18:30,158 --> 01:18:35,279
there's a company that actually sells

1865
01:18:32,439 --> 01:18:38,479
sells the uh The Columns that are widely

1866
01:18:35,279 --> 01:18:41,759
used in the shimadzu system so a company

1867
01:18:38,479 --> 01:18:43,879
called resc up here in bont Pennsylvania

1868
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:47,079
has a schedule one license and their

1869
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:48,960
standards are right on the [ __ ] money

1870
01:18:47,079 --> 01:18:51,880
and I've had to rely on their standards

1871
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:57,279
now for machines for for several labs

1872
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:59,279
and so rese re s TK and their Raptor

1873
01:18:57,279 --> 01:19:01,960
column is one of the best columns that's

1874
01:18:59,279 --> 01:19:05,359
out there for doing reverse pH also

1875
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:07,520
several companies in Europe that uh well

1876
01:19:05,359 --> 01:19:13,198
and in Europe the only thing that's

1877
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:14,960
controlled is THC 9 and uh uh delta8

1878
01:19:13,198 --> 01:19:17,519
everything else is

1879
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:20,119
available how it should including

1880
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:20,120
including

1881
01:19:21,399 --> 01:19:26,759
thcp Weir that's a that's very

1882
01:19:24,319 --> 01:19:28,679
interesting the what's odd too is that

1883
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:33,119
we ended up getting standards from El

1884
01:19:28,679 --> 01:19:35,319
soy and then um I think uh we we settled

1885
01:19:33,119 --> 01:19:37,719
on what you were just saying we ended up

1886
01:19:35,319 --> 01:19:41,198
just getting them from uh digipath or no

1887
01:19:37,719 --> 01:19:43,000
from uh resch resc yeah is kind of where

1888
01:19:41,198 --> 01:19:45,238
they've gone at this point and and to be

1889
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:47,520
honest with everyone I I had a great

1890
01:19:45,238 --> 01:19:49,559
time at steep pill I learned so much it

1891
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:52,360
was it was a great opportunity it was

1892
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:56,080
really something that like it it was

1893
01:19:52,359 --> 01:19:57,599
training that allowed me to to to to

1894
01:19:56,079 --> 01:19:59,800
understand [ __ ] when I heard it in

1895
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:02,000
the scientific area and it helped me

1896
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:04,279
also you know it was cool because I went

1897
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:07,439
back and through the Cannabis industry

1898
01:20:04,279 --> 01:20:09,279
learned chemistry you know organic chem

1899
01:20:07,439 --> 01:20:12,198
every one of the organic chem schedules

1900
01:20:09,279 --> 01:20:14,198
you could get because we had phds there

1901
01:20:12,198 --> 01:20:17,119
and oddly enough I was their boss which

1902
01:20:14,198 --> 01:20:19,158
was [ __ ] weird and I just absorbed

1903
01:20:17,119 --> 01:20:21,279
all that information and learned so much

1904
01:20:19,158 --> 01:20:23,238
I got educated on it I think testing's

1905
01:20:21,279 --> 01:20:25,319
great I just think right now in our

1906
01:20:23,238 --> 01:20:27,678
industry the testing industry is just

1907
01:20:25,319 --> 01:20:31,279
rampant with [ __ ] it's you're trying

1908
01:20:27,679 --> 01:20:34,560
to fit and monetize a business um I

1909
01:20:31,279 --> 01:20:37,559
would agree with you that and coupled

1910
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:42,080
with the simple fact that okay the stuff

1911
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:46,440
that tested the highest both the 28

1912
01:20:42,079 --> 01:20:49,238
29 uh 61 and the other ones that were

1913
01:20:46,439 --> 01:20:52,678
even 25 or something they weren't the

1914
01:20:49,238 --> 01:20:55,039
preferred smoke of people people liked

1915
01:20:52,679 --> 01:20:57,279
the stuff that was really Turing rich

1916
01:20:55,039 --> 01:21:01,238
and had a really loud flavor and had the

1917
01:20:57,279 --> 01:21:01,238
right effects that's what they

1918
01:21:01,639 --> 01:21:09,359
wanted DC works you'll know that there

1919
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:11,639
can be very subtle changes in the method

1920
01:21:09,359 --> 01:21:15,880
used to make the sample that can give

1921
01:21:11,639 --> 01:21:19,000
you very vastly different results and so

1922
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:21,880
it's it's probably more about sample

1923
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:24,000
prep and the the individual operator

1924
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:25,960
that's running the hlc other than the

1925
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:28,639
machine it's itself the machine is

1926
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:30,920
basically going to the concentration of

1927
01:21:28,639 --> 01:21:33,679
the sample that you put in there but if

1928
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:36,319
the tech is not you know knowledgeable

1929
01:21:33,679 --> 01:21:38,960
enough on on how to make a sample and

1930
01:21:36,319 --> 01:21:41,599
how to do a reproducible measurement and

1931
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:44,439
make sure that s sample is run on a

1932
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:46,800
machine that's properly calibrated and

1933
01:21:44,439 --> 01:21:49,000
their Baseline is nice and flat and

1934
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:51,400
doesn't like drop off a cliff at the end

1935
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:55,039
and they're not just running some quick

1936
01:21:51,399 --> 01:21:58,279
method I mean hlc can be very very

1937
01:21:55,039 --> 01:22:00,198
accurate and what I will say is that I'm

1938
01:21:58,279 --> 01:22:02,639
actually uh on the other side of the

1939
01:22:00,198 --> 01:22:06,238
coin Addison I think the testing

1940
01:22:02,639 --> 01:22:08,880
industry on the Cannabis side has come a

1941
01:22:06,238 --> 01:22:11,439
long way in the last handful of years

1942
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:14,400
compared to where it was say like four

1943
01:22:11,439 --> 01:22:16,719
or five years ago where yeah you send a

1944
01:22:14,399 --> 01:22:18,439
similar sample to 10 different labs and

1945
01:22:16,719 --> 01:22:20,960
you're going to get 10 different results

1946
01:22:18,439 --> 01:22:22,960
because everyone runs a different method

1947
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:25,039
I think there's been a lot more

1948
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:27,679
standardization you know I said on that

1949
01:22:25,039 --> 01:22:30,760
group of people ATM that's trying to

1950
01:22:27,679 --> 01:22:32,719
standardize a set of tests and there's a

1951
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:34,280
lot of you know Cooks in the kitchen on

1952
01:22:32,719 --> 01:22:37,279
that but ultimately at the end of the

1953
01:22:34,279 --> 01:22:40,279
day there are very reliable methods for

1954
01:22:37,279 --> 01:22:40,279
quantifying

1955
01:22:45,479 --> 01:22:51,919
canab that are present in delta8 that's

1956
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:55,120
made from CBD are not Baseline resolved

1957
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:58,199
by hlc and there needs to be a GC

1958
01:22:55,119 --> 01:23:01,119
measurement to basically look at uh the

1959
01:22:58,198 --> 01:23:04,000
purity of of d8 that's derived from from

1960
01:23:01,119 --> 01:23:06,960
CBD and so the folks at KCA labs are

1961
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:09,639
actually working on that and so yeah

1962
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:12,719
Addison definitely like Steep Hill was

1963
01:23:09,639 --> 01:23:14,600
one of the first you know uh Labs that

1964
01:23:12,719 --> 01:23:16,960
sort of you know carry the flag of we

1965
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:20,280
really need to do standardized good

1966
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:22,520
measurements there's a lot of innovation

1967
01:23:20,279 --> 01:23:25,679
and a lot of people who have basically

1968
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:28,800
entered the testing industry

1969
01:23:25,679 --> 01:23:30,480
and I do a lot of testing now Sam I

1970
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:33,199
don't know how much testing you do

1971
01:23:30,479 --> 01:23:35,119
lately I don't do nothing anymore and

1972
01:23:33,198 --> 01:23:37,439
what I can tell you is when I send

1973
01:23:35,119 --> 01:23:40,000
samples to five or six different Labs I

1974
01:23:37,439 --> 01:23:42,198
see correlation of results I see that

1975
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:45,439
labs are actually getting their acts

1976
01:23:42,198 --> 01:23:47,638
together and when I send one sample to a

1977
01:23:45,439 --> 01:23:49,399
lab and I get one measurement I can

1978
01:23:47,639 --> 01:23:51,600
basically predict that measurement based

1979
01:23:49,399 --> 01:23:54,079
on the own hplc measurement that we've

1980
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:57,079
made in our own lab and so the last

1981
01:23:54,079 --> 01:23:59,679
thing is that I think the more and more

1982
01:23:57,079 --> 01:24:02,000
testing happens the more and more weak

1983
01:23:59,679 --> 01:24:05,920
sisters are going to be knocked out

1984
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:09,039
because producers have to rely on a good

1985
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:11,679
COA so their product is sellable and if

1986
01:24:09,039 --> 01:24:13,600
their COA is not good that means they

1987
01:24:11,679 --> 01:24:16,158
can't sell their product so there are

1988
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:19,120
are relationships that are starting to

1989
01:24:16,158 --> 01:24:21,599
stratify between producers and testing

1990
01:24:19,119 --> 01:24:23,639
labs in the industry because they're

1991
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:26,960
getting more reproducible results

1992
01:24:23,639 --> 01:24:30,239
they're selling more product and I think

1993
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:33,000
that the needle is moving closer to

1994
01:24:30,238 --> 01:24:35,839
actually characterizing these samples

1995
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:38,279
more accurately than they were say just

1996
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:40,760
three or four or five years ago you're

1997
01:24:38,279 --> 01:24:45,519
right Mark and it's even more than that

1998
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:45,520
because the industry only started in

1999
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:50,520
2008 you know

2000
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:52,360
right the fact is is that is that

2001
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:54,679
there's nothing unique about cannabis

2002
01:24:52,359 --> 01:24:56,399
that makes it different than of the

2003
01:24:54,679 --> 01:25:00,118
other foods that we eat and if you look

2004
01:24:56,399 --> 01:25:02,198
at any food product or any FDA label

2005
01:25:00,118 --> 01:25:04,599
required you could see that there are

2006
01:25:02,198 --> 01:25:07,599
Labs like Euro fins and other labs that

2007
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:10,400
basically do measurements of food you

2008
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:12,360
know products all the time and and part

2009
01:25:10,399 --> 01:25:15,359
of that is not only you know just the

2010
01:25:12,359 --> 01:25:17,319
the the standard regulation but it's

2011
01:25:15,359 --> 01:25:20,399
just also you know part of the marketing

2012
01:25:17,319 --> 01:25:22,158
thing you know and you know Addison what

2013
01:25:20,399 --> 01:25:25,279
I would say too you know is again you

2014
01:25:22,158 --> 01:25:28,000
know like I I think that where you guys

2015
01:25:25,279 --> 01:25:32,118
were in in assessing that there needed

2016
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:34,560
to be a testing industry parallel with

2017
01:25:32,118 --> 01:25:36,399
the producing of cannabis products I

2018
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:39,560
think that's where the vision was I mean

2019
01:25:36,399 --> 01:25:41,920
it's like you can't just produce stuff

2020
01:25:39,560 --> 01:25:43,800
and not have third-party testing you

2021
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:46,399
have to produce it and then you have to

2022
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:48,800
throw it over the fence to a lab that's

2023
01:25:46,399 --> 01:25:51,359
hopefully certified and it you know that

2024
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:53,440
means that their hlc's are all

2025
01:25:51,359 --> 01:25:56,000
appropriately calibrated and they've

2026
01:25:53,439 --> 01:25:58,319
hired you know good people to run those

2027
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:01,118
hlc's so the results you're going to get

2028
01:25:58,319 --> 01:26:04,118
are actually meaningful hopefully that

2029
01:26:01,118 --> 01:26:06,880
Loop is becoming more and more

2030
01:26:04,118 --> 01:26:10,880
productive and we could ask aten because

2031
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:13,679
atn's business is basically a a catalyst

2032
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:16,239
for that Loop between producers and

2033
01:26:13,679 --> 01:26:19,118
testing labs to produce products that

2034
01:26:16,238 --> 01:26:20,638
are legal and compliant under the law

2035
01:26:19,118 --> 01:26:23,000
you know you know what's interesting the

2036
01:26:20,639 --> 01:26:25,359
biggest problem is accurate labs and

2037
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:27,719
I'll explain why the more accurate that

2038
01:26:25,359 --> 01:26:30,799
a lab is the better that they're going

2039
01:26:27,719 --> 01:26:32,520
to reveal the issues that Growers are

2040
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:36,600
having in getting their potency up now

2041
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:39,199
etan will tell you this if if a lab if a

2042
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:41,840
The Growers will shop their product to

2043
01:26:39,198 --> 01:26:44,238
different labs to get the highest THC

2044
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:46,039
percentage so that it sells better

2045
01:26:44,238 --> 01:26:47,519
they'll they'll run the same sample at

2046
01:26:46,039 --> 01:26:50,039
five different labs and when they find

2047
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:51,840
that lab that's a little Loosey Goosey

2048
01:26:50,039 --> 01:26:53,359
that bumps the higher numbers that's

2049
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:56,079
their [ __ ] lab and when you're

2050
01:26:53,359 --> 01:26:58,079
selecting BAS B on that there's a

2051
01:26:56,079 --> 01:27:00,600
problem with the system itself it's not

2052
01:26:58,079 --> 01:27:01,840
regulated enough on the laboratory side

2053
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:04,440
to make sure that they know what they're

2054
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:06,600
doing the main problem there is the BCC

2055
01:27:04,439 --> 01:27:09,359
in California doesn't know what the [ __ ]

2056
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:10,960
Cannabis Testing is so you've got people

2057
01:27:09,359 --> 01:27:12,839
in there that don't know what they're

2058
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:15,039
doing when those guys are the ones that

2059
01:27:12,840 --> 01:27:16,719
are setting the rule it creates this

2060
01:27:15,039 --> 01:27:18,479
environment and that's our environment

2061
01:27:16,719 --> 01:27:20,840
right now we have lab the more accurate

2062
01:27:18,479 --> 01:27:23,198
you are when I talk to Labs they're like

2063
01:27:20,840 --> 01:27:25,079
the more accurate that we are the less

2064
01:27:23,198 --> 01:27:27,719
customers we have when we send them the

2065
01:27:25,079 --> 01:27:30,319
test result right that's the lowest of

2066
01:27:27,719 --> 01:27:33,399
of of their and they tell them this the

2067
01:27:30,319 --> 01:27:35,759
the the company tells the lab oh man we

2068
01:27:33,399 --> 01:27:37,479
love you guys you have great pricing but

2069
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:40,000
we can't you I mean the test results

2070
01:27:37,479 --> 01:27:41,519
come back fast everything's good but

2071
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:44,679
you're everything we run with you guys

2072
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:46,400
is low and then these guys they take a

2073
01:27:44,679 --> 01:27:48,679
little longer to get it back but we get

2074
01:27:46,399 --> 01:27:51,679
higher numbers there so they're there

2075
01:27:48,679 --> 01:27:53,399
there's a system that allows [ __ ] to

2076
01:27:51,679 --> 01:27:55,000
in Washington that happened and they

2077
01:27:53,399 --> 01:27:57,799
actually called it out

2078
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:59,800
and they closed down one one whole Lab

2079
01:27:57,800 --> 01:28:02,840
was running like 80% of the

2080
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:04,679
state um every single lab in Oregon went

2081
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:08,760
away pretty

2082
01:28:04,679 --> 01:28:12,000
much it's hard guys labat hard from the

2083
01:28:08,760 --> 01:28:12,000
beginning and and in

2084
01:28:15,158 --> 01:28:23,158
can British Columbia last week I'm

2085
01:28:17,719 --> 01:28:24,760
talking to Labs over in in in Calgary

2086
01:28:23,158 --> 01:28:28,879
and they're talking about they have to

2087
01:28:24,760 --> 01:28:31,920
fit 6% THC on your rosin in order to

2088
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:35,359
have it available to the market and if

2089
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:38,960
you don't fit if you make so they have

2090
01:28:35,359 --> 01:28:42,158
to buy the the herb from a producer in

2091
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:45,158
faith then bring it to their laboratory

2092
01:28:42,158 --> 01:28:47,118
wash it and then find a lab and maybe

2093
01:28:45,158 --> 01:28:49,238
it's the one lab they work with and it

2094
01:28:47,118 --> 01:28:51,079
has to fit within that threshold window

2095
01:28:49,238 --> 01:28:54,399
so everything that you're saying is

2096
01:28:51,079 --> 01:28:57,279
unbelievably disheartening to a family

2097
01:28:54,399 --> 01:29:00,679
farmer or a family grer you know maybe

2098
01:28:57,279 --> 01:29:02,759
if you have like an investor business

2099
01:29:00,679 --> 01:29:05,600
that you can just fold and start a new

2100
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:07,159
one you know it might be okay to you

2101
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:08,600
know play in that game but a lot of the

2102
01:29:07,158 --> 01:29:10,759
Breeders you're talking about Addison

2103
01:29:08,600 --> 01:29:12,560
and California Are Family Farm breeders

2104
01:29:10,760 --> 01:29:14,119
and they can't just fold up because of

2105
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:17,360
that and it's the same here in the cies

2106
01:29:14,118 --> 01:29:20,079
in British Columbia so you know I would

2107
01:29:17,359 --> 01:29:23,399
appreciate less regulation on us if they

2108
01:29:20,079 --> 01:29:25,639
don't have a system that's viable for us

2109
01:29:23,399 --> 01:29:29,719
to play in because otherwise it's

2110
01:29:25,639 --> 01:29:31,719
just ah it's that it's a waste of energy

2111
01:29:29,719 --> 01:29:34,840
well and again you're only dealing with

2112
01:29:31,719 --> 01:29:36,679
this snapshot in time and that's is also

2113
01:29:34,840 --> 01:29:38,800
the problem I have with California

2114
01:29:36,679 --> 01:29:41,158
Cannabis is because once you have that

2115
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:43,079
snap snapshot in time you have a year to

2116
01:29:41,158 --> 01:29:44,920
get rid of that product and of course

2117
01:29:43,079 --> 01:29:47,719
what we're seeing now is we're about to

2118
01:29:44,920 --> 01:29:50,239
see a huge glut here in California we're

2119
01:29:47,719 --> 01:29:53,079
seeing price is plummet from last year's

2120
01:29:50,238 --> 01:29:55,000
Harvest because it's now harvest season

2121
01:29:53,079 --> 01:29:56,880
we haven't seen this type of event we

2122
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:59,399
saw it with Oregon but it was right

2123
01:29:56,880 --> 01:30:01,440
after they harvested now we're seeing

2124
01:29:59,399 --> 01:30:04,000
the opposite end in the sense here in

2125
01:30:01,439 --> 01:30:07,399
California is that we now have so much

2126
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:09,719
now old cannabis two it's a snapshot of

2127
01:30:07,399 --> 01:30:12,439
that cannabis in that form not how it

2128
01:30:09,719 --> 01:30:14,158
actually comes in that form so even in

2129
01:30:12,439 --> 01:30:16,279
the form that it's tested at doesn't

2130
01:30:14,158 --> 01:30:18,879
mean that's that's what I'm selling it

2131
01:30:16,279 --> 01:30:21,960
at in the dispensary because even this

2132
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:25,480
wonderful you know water hash Etc that I

2133
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:27,800
get still has so much oxygen uh trapped

2134
01:30:25,479 --> 01:30:29,638
in the container etc etc there's still

2135
01:30:27,800 --> 01:30:32,039
degradation that's happening and

2136
01:30:29,639 --> 01:30:34,600
especially if you look at the jars of a

2137
01:30:32,039 --> 01:30:37,600
in the amount of oxygen nobody's taking

2138
01:30:34,600 --> 01:30:40,360
the time and do an 8020 nitrogen CO2

2139
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:43,360
shoot in to actually protect the flow so

2140
01:30:40,359 --> 01:30:44,880
that it doesn't actually degrade you

2141
01:30:43,359 --> 01:30:47,319
know and they're definitely not doing

2142
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:49,719
that at the concentrate level no way

2143
01:30:47,319 --> 01:30:52,439
shape or form to actually stabilize the

2144
01:30:49,719 --> 01:30:54,520
product so even the system itself is

2145
01:30:52,439 --> 01:30:56,118
kind of [ __ ] because only dealing

2146
01:30:54,520 --> 01:30:58,199
with that snapshot in time when that

2147
01:30:56,118 --> 01:31:01,039
particular representative sample was

2148
01:30:58,198 --> 01:31:02,118
tested not what the actual person is

2149
01:31:01,039 --> 01:31:04,479
receiving at the time of their

2150
01:31:02,118 --> 01:31:07,039
purchasing which is the real market and

2151
01:31:04,479 --> 01:31:09,439
the real reality and the big problem

2152
01:31:07,039 --> 01:31:11,118
then it goes beyond just the you know

2153
01:31:09,439 --> 01:31:13,960
the testing and the instability of

2154
01:31:11,118 --> 01:31:16,319
testing you know it's the also

2155
01:31:13,960 --> 01:31:18,039
maintaining that product consistently

2156
01:31:16,319 --> 01:31:20,000
through the distribution centers and

2157
01:31:18,039 --> 01:31:22,359
points all the way till it gets to the

2158
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:25,279
individual person at the counter and

2159
01:31:22,359 --> 01:31:27,759
that's a huge problem issue being

2160
01:31:25,279 --> 01:31:29,519
ignored yeah it happens here all these

2161
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:31,119
things that you guys have discussed have

2162
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:33,000
happened here are happening here in

2163
01:31:31,118 --> 01:31:35,439
Canada as well like people with their

2164
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:37,719
fresh frozen CRS in containers paying

2165
01:31:35,439 --> 01:31:40,279
1,700 a month from and they still have

2166
01:31:37,719 --> 01:31:42,399
last year's CRS that still fresh frozen

2167
01:31:40,279 --> 01:31:44,319
that's going on we have Labs that are

2168
01:31:42,399 --> 01:31:46,920
pumping numbers and giving people better

2169
01:31:44,319 --> 01:31:49,039
numbers than other labs you know we have

2170
01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:51,239
a whole situation where we have an

2171
01:31:49,039 --> 01:31:53,920
industry of people selling produce that

2172
01:31:51,238 --> 01:31:56,718
doesn't realize it's produce and is like

2173
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:58,920
first question is your Vault cooled oh

2174
01:31:56,719 --> 01:32:00,800
man I'm like oh so all of your Tarpin

2175
01:31:58,920 --> 01:32:02,520
are currently off gasing in your Vault

2176
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:04,639
right now and you're representing

2177
01:32:02,520 --> 01:32:06,840
companies that are only in the one to

2178
01:32:04,639 --> 01:32:08,920
1.5 tpine range in the first place

2179
01:32:06,840 --> 01:32:12,119
instead of the three to five exceptional

2180
01:32:08,920 --> 01:32:14,039
range so you don't have any movement you

2181
01:32:12,118 --> 01:32:15,679
have no movement you need to keep this

2182
01:32:14,039 --> 01:32:17,679
[ __ ] cold I was telling people in the

2183
01:32:15,679 --> 01:32:19,000
Prairies dude build a [ __ ] tunnel

2184
01:32:17,679 --> 01:32:21,279
through the center of your building that

2185
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:24,760
goes into your Vault and pull the minus

2186
01:32:21,279 --> 01:32:27,679
40° Canadian Air uh out there into your

2187
01:32:24,760 --> 01:32:30,880
Vault because to keep all of this stuff

2188
01:32:27,679 --> 01:32:32,920
at room temperature is absolutely

2189
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:35,279
batshit you imagine hey Addison I'm

2190
01:32:32,920 --> 01:32:38,000
going to send you a container of spinach

2191
01:32:35,279 --> 01:32:41,000
but I'm not going to be cooling it it

2192
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:43,399
would get to Addison and it would be

2193
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:46,560
liquid we're in the produce business

2194
01:32:43,399 --> 01:32:48,638
here right yeah I think Marcus is

2195
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:51,000
bringing up a really good point in into

2196
01:32:48,639 --> 01:32:54,880
what ATN and also Dr Mark was talking

2197
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:56,760
about and all of us really I think like

2198
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:58,480
from a formulation standpoint it's

2199
01:32:56,760 --> 01:33:00,320
really important to have this snapshot

2200
01:32:58,479 --> 01:33:02,479
but that snapshot is really limited so

2201
01:33:00,319 --> 01:33:06,039
there's only so much is telling me so I

2202
01:33:02,479 --> 01:33:08,399
can only you know be so educated to make

2203
01:33:06,039 --> 01:33:11,639
products that are based on a system that

2204
01:33:08,399 --> 01:33:13,559
yes to atn's point is inherently broken

2205
01:33:11,639 --> 01:33:15,199
Mark's you know working really hard hard

2206
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:17,800
behind the scenes to try to fill those

2207
01:33:15,198 --> 01:33:19,678
holes and try to fix it but then we have

2208
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:22,079
the responsibility of everyone else

2209
01:33:19,679 --> 01:33:24,520
including ourselves for supply chain

2210
01:33:22,079 --> 01:33:26,760
which Marcus just just out line which is

2211
01:33:24,520 --> 01:33:28,760
super important because once it leaves

2212
01:33:26,760 --> 01:33:32,840
our hands it's really up to everyone

2213
01:33:28,760 --> 01:33:35,400
else now to then have that same care and

2214
01:33:32,840 --> 01:33:37,159
compassion to make sure that this this

2215
01:33:35,399 --> 01:33:39,879
you know these chemicals or this these

2216
01:33:37,158 --> 01:33:39,879
products I should

2217
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:50,279
say seems to be like walking on the moon

2218
01:33:47,399 --> 01:33:52,719
these days but you know I think it's

2219
01:33:50,279 --> 01:33:54,679
it's important that you know if we can

2220
01:33:52,719 --> 01:33:56,639
just agree on something at the at the

2221
01:33:54,679 --> 01:33:59,079
testing level I think that would really

2222
01:33:56,639 --> 01:34:02,039
help and then again then I think we

2223
01:33:59,079 --> 01:34:04,679
should hold people to accountability on

2224
01:34:02,039 --> 01:34:07,679
the supply chain aspect if you don't

2225
01:34:04,679 --> 01:34:10,520
have a freezer and you're a you know a

2226
01:34:07,679 --> 01:34:12,960
distribution center maybe you know there

2227
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:14,920
should be fines for that you know maybe

2228
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:17,439
there should be some consequences for

2229
01:34:14,920 --> 01:34:20,960
for these people that are not taking the

2230
01:34:17,439 --> 01:34:23,359
care that you are the advantage Colin

2231
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:25,679
yeah Advantage right I always told

2232
01:34:23,359 --> 01:34:27,880
people if you want an advantage freeze

2233
01:34:25,679 --> 01:34:29,719
your [ __ ] make it cold make it as cold

2234
01:34:27,880 --> 01:34:31,679
as possible some of it won't be able to

2235
01:34:29,719 --> 01:34:33,800
be frozen you'll just want to keep it

2236
01:34:31,679 --> 01:34:35,719
really kind of refrigerator cold and

2237
01:34:33,800 --> 01:34:38,119
you're going to have to pay a couple of

2238
01:34:35,719 --> 01:34:39,520
prices by learning which ones are the

2239
01:34:38,118 --> 01:34:42,238
right ones to freeze and which ones

2240
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:44,840
aren't the right ones to freeze and so

2241
01:34:42,238 --> 01:34:48,158
right yeah it is what it is people are

2242
01:34:44,840 --> 01:34:50,560
gonna have to get on it I mean Supply

2243
01:34:48,158 --> 01:34:54,479
Chain's critical and I think in every

2244
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:54,480
part of this business like

2245
01:35:00,639 --> 01:35:05,760
was pound they go from 85 to 200 bucks

2246
01:35:03,679 --> 01:35:07,760
depending on their viability that hasn't

2247
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:10,119
changed everything else arounds It

2248
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:12,079
Changes Everything Changes except for

2249
01:35:10,118 --> 01:35:14,319
that price and when we saw that we were

2250
01:35:12,079 --> 01:35:16,198
just like you know wait a minute I can

2251
01:35:14,319 --> 01:35:20,198
still go to a grower and go hey look I

2252
01:35:16,198 --> 01:35:23,158
can get you 950 bucks for a k you know

2253
01:35:20,198 --> 01:35:25,638
for the the for the 2008 grams or

2254
01:35:23,158 --> 01:35:27,679
whatever the hell we need and a lot of

2255
01:35:25,639 --> 01:35:30,319
guys you know when we go into these

2256
01:35:27,679 --> 01:35:33,319
girls and talk to them um if we're if

2257
01:35:30,319 --> 01:35:36,319
we're offering a farm $60 a pound for

2258
01:35:33,319 --> 01:35:38,279
wet material they're profiting they're

2259
01:35:36,319 --> 01:35:39,840
making money they're making money

2260
01:35:38,279 --> 01:35:41,719
because they're not having to dry it

2261
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:43,960
they're making money because it it it's

2262
01:35:41,719 --> 01:35:46,520
out of there very quickly and it and

2263
01:35:43,960 --> 01:35:48,880
that model works now if they're getting

2264
01:35:46,520 --> 01:35:51,440
60 and we're able to sell it for 85

2265
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:54,079
there's room for us to do that with our

2266
01:35:51,439 --> 01:35:56,118
partners if we're getting if they're

2267
01:35:54,079 --> 01:35:57,639
getting 60 and we're able to sell it for

2268
01:35:56,118 --> 01:35:59,759
200 there's even more so we give them

2269
01:35:57,639 --> 01:36:02,359
more than 60 we now bring them up with

2270
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:06,159
us and say hey here's how you can get

2271
01:36:02,359 --> 01:36:09,039
$80 a pound wet and you add up those 80

2272
01:36:06,158 --> 01:36:11,198
pound those five 80 you know wet pounds

2273
01:36:09,039 --> 01:36:14,279
they equal more than what you'd get for

2274
01:36:11,198 --> 01:36:15,719
a dry pound when you start showing that

2275
01:36:14,279 --> 01:36:17,399
and you show that model and you

2276
01:36:15,719 --> 01:36:18,679
understand the supply chain that way

2277
01:36:17,399 --> 01:36:21,238
that's where you want to be and that's

2278
01:36:18,679 --> 01:36:22,639
where hash is that's that's the only

2279
01:36:21,238 --> 01:36:25,519
thing in our business that's doing it

2280
01:36:22,639 --> 01:36:27,679
right now is is that and that's the only

2281
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:30,360
place that it's left now BHO there's

2282
01:36:27,679 --> 01:36:32,679
room in BHO at the highest end of the

2283
01:36:30,359 --> 01:36:34,519
market at the diamond end of the market

2284
01:36:32,679 --> 01:36:36,399
but there's only room at the highest end

2285
01:36:34,520 --> 01:36:38,119
of the market for BHO there's no other

2286
01:36:36,399 --> 01:36:40,599
room at the bottom you got to see where

2287
01:36:38,118 --> 01:36:43,479
the room is and then be able to do it

2288
01:36:40,600 --> 01:36:44,880
and it's like you know a maker can buy

2289
01:36:43,479 --> 01:36:48,158
Frozen pounds at

2290
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:50,600
$200 wet and and put them out and sell

2291
01:36:48,158 --> 01:36:52,839
them and and still make really great

2292
01:36:50,600 --> 01:36:54,199
money they don't know that or understand

2293
01:36:52,840 --> 01:36:56,800
it they're they're they're just not

2294
01:36:54,198 --> 01:36:59,158
educated to the point where they have to

2295
01:36:56,800 --> 01:37:01,840
trust and commit and what we've done has

2296
01:36:59,158 --> 01:37:03,479
introduced the ability to say hey on

2297
01:37:01,840 --> 01:37:05,840
those 2,000 pounds that are in the

2298
01:37:03,479 --> 01:37:07,799
ground right there let me apply this

2299
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:10,239
model to it and see if it works it does

2300
01:37:07,800 --> 01:37:12,760
work um and and it's G it'll move more

2301
01:37:10,238 --> 01:37:14,718
material it'll actually what we think is

2302
01:37:12,760 --> 01:37:16,199
that good work is going to lower the

2303
01:37:14,719 --> 01:37:19,679
price of hash

2304
01:37:16,198 --> 01:37:22,198
slowly um and make it more affordable uh

2305
01:37:19,679 --> 01:37:24,719
I see BHO as a lower barrier of Entry to

2306
01:37:22,198 --> 01:37:26,638
Hash consumption you know it costs less

2307
01:37:24,719 --> 01:37:28,800
it's easier to get into um and then

2308
01:37:26,639 --> 01:37:30,560
you'll see guys sort of start to step up

2309
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:31,960
their glass game because they start to

2310
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:33,600
understand that they have a piece of

2311
01:37:31,960 --> 01:37:36,118
tpine analysis equipment in front of

2312
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:37,800
them and how do I use that oh what nail

2313
01:37:36,118 --> 01:37:39,799
do I have what's the surface area and

2314
01:37:37,800 --> 01:37:41,440
nail how much air is coming through here

2315
01:37:39,800 --> 01:37:43,800
how can I cap that air and control the

2316
01:37:41,439 --> 01:37:47,118
flow to get it to use my column that I

2317
01:37:43,800 --> 01:37:49,039
have here to get you know it's like you

2318
01:37:47,118 --> 01:37:52,118
accelerate your understanding to the

2319
01:37:49,039 --> 01:37:55,519
point where you start to only want to

2320
01:37:52,118 --> 01:37:58,359
smoke very good rosin because it's easy

2321
01:37:55,520 --> 01:38:00,040
to clean up or melt because it has a

2322
01:37:58,359 --> 01:38:02,359
different taste and a different approach

2323
01:38:00,039 --> 01:38:04,079
that's really where and we know this we

2324
01:38:02,359 --> 01:38:07,158
all know this because we're here we've

2325
01:38:04,079 --> 01:38:08,880
been doing this but the public and

2326
01:38:07,158 --> 01:38:10,799
opening the public up to this and

2327
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:12,319
starting to get them into it there's a

2328
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:13,639
lot of profit there's a lot of money to

2329
01:38:12,319 --> 01:38:16,118
be made the biggest problem in our

2330
01:38:13,639 --> 01:38:18,560
industry is that people don't use their

2331
01:38:16,118 --> 01:38:20,880
brain and logic to figure out how to

2332
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:22,920
work with one another and make things

2333
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:24,039
and so we all make money everyone wants

2334
01:38:22,920 --> 01:38:26,039
to crook

2335
01:38:24,039 --> 01:38:28,519
and everyone wants to control and be the

2336
01:38:26,039 --> 01:38:30,840
and it's like what I love about hash is

2337
01:38:28,520 --> 01:38:33,719
we as a community are starting to teach

2338
01:38:30,840 --> 01:38:36,480
everybody else collectively not as a

2339
01:38:33,719 --> 01:38:38,760
master but just as a learning a learning

2340
01:38:36,479 --> 01:38:40,879
entity that's moving forward that if we

2341
01:38:38,760 --> 01:38:42,960
work together and we approach things in

2342
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:44,880
an open source way and we make it so

2343
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:47,000
everyone can make money we can do this

2344
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:48,880
for longer and we can do this forever

2345
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:50,920
and and we all do really [ __ ] well

2346
01:38:48,880 --> 01:38:53,639
like I'm sick and tired of these small

2347
01:38:50,920 --> 01:38:55,920
growers in California coming out that a

2348
01:38:53,639 --> 01:38:57,800
wreck and being like I can't I'm not

2349
01:38:55,920 --> 01:39:00,000
making it I can't make any money stop

2350
01:38:57,800 --> 01:39:02,079
[ __ ] lying dude you're you're selling

2351
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:04,079
50% of your Harvest on the black market

2352
01:39:02,079 --> 01:39:06,039
you're selling 50% the other way and you

2353
01:39:04,079 --> 01:39:07,679
have to look this way in order to

2354
01:39:06,039 --> 01:39:10,760
continue to do what you do you can

2355
01:39:07,679 --> 01:39:13,520
either go full wreck or I I honestly I

2356
01:39:10,760 --> 01:39:15,520
think do both I did both I did one

2357
01:39:13,520 --> 01:39:17,800
before and I think do both until you get

2358
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:20,560
caught right until you get in trouble

2359
01:39:17,800 --> 01:39:23,599
because that's always been our thing but

2360
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:25,599
it look it there's more [ __ ] material

2361
01:39:23,599 --> 01:39:28,520
being sold for fresh frozen in

2362
01:39:25,599 --> 01:39:30,239
California then there is then there if

2363
01:39:28,520 --> 01:39:32,199
you produce all of that fresh frozen

2364
01:39:30,238 --> 01:39:34,238
into hash you'd have five times the

2365
01:39:32,198 --> 01:39:37,638
amount of [ __ ] hash it's being

2366
01:39:34,238 --> 01:39:40,319
sold whose fault is that it's not my

2367
01:39:37,639 --> 01:39:42,960
fault it's the bcc's issue and and

2368
01:39:40,319 --> 01:39:45,920
honestly I think a lawyer would be able

2369
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:48,840
to prove in court that the BCC is

2370
01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:50,840
complicit in drug smuggling and and

2371
01:39:48,840 --> 01:39:51,920
because of this reason for this purpose

2372
01:39:50,840 --> 01:39:54,079
because they're the ones that are

2373
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:58,639
watching it if you see the numbers and

2374
01:39:54,079 --> 01:40:00,439
you just made $887 million on tax okay

2375
01:39:58,639 --> 01:40:03,039
that you're allowing more production to

2376
01:40:00,439 --> 01:40:04,638
occur more sale to occur than what's

2377
01:40:03,039 --> 01:40:06,599
going out into the into the actual

2378
01:40:04,639 --> 01:40:08,239
dispensary then you know where that's

2379
01:40:06,599 --> 01:40:09,880
going and you're complicit in that

2380
01:40:08,238 --> 01:40:11,279
you're actually a part of that and

2381
01:40:09,880 --> 01:40:14,599
that's what's happening in our industry

2382
01:40:11,279 --> 01:40:17,719
so just to correct Addison it's now the

2383
01:40:14,599 --> 01:40:19,639
DCC it's the department now it's being

2384
01:40:17,719 --> 01:40:21,719
Consolidated into one so it's no longer

2385
01:40:19,639 --> 01:40:23,800
just BCC we have to change our

2386
01:40:21,719 --> 01:40:26,840
nomenclature so people are where we're

2387
01:40:23,800 --> 01:40:28,560
talking about now the department of

2388
01:40:26,840 --> 01:40:32,079
cannabis control which we are now

2389
01:40:28,560 --> 01:40:34,960
currently under 90-day emergency RS

2390
01:40:32,079 --> 01:40:37,158
bigger and Blinder than ever before like

2391
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:38,760
I just also just agree with the

2392
01:40:37,158 --> 01:40:40,960
community aspect and that's what I love

2393
01:40:38,760 --> 01:40:42,960
about Rosen and with h the the pure

2394
01:40:40,960 --> 01:40:44,960
certification that we created you know

2395
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:47,000
we have a lot of farms and also

2396
01:40:44,960 --> 01:40:49,520
producers in California and that's been

2397
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:52,279
our whole entire model from the

2398
01:40:49,520 --> 01:40:54,400
beginning was not a mon monetary model

2399
01:40:52,279 --> 01:40:57,279
but more of a community model and how we

2400
01:40:54,399 --> 01:40:58,839
can all survive and be a business in

2401
01:40:57,279 --> 01:41:01,198
five our our whole thing is like are we

2402
01:40:58,840 --> 01:41:03,560
a business in five more years from now

2403
01:41:01,198 --> 01:41:05,839
because if not all we're doing is just

2404
01:41:03,560 --> 01:41:07,440
everything we're doing is just Folly so

2405
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:10,079
and we recognized from the beginning

2406
01:41:07,439 --> 01:41:12,799
that you know solventless and and

2407
01:41:10,079 --> 01:41:14,760
non-chemical extractions were more

2408
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:16,239
valuable and more heady so part of our

2409
01:41:14,760 --> 01:41:19,079
certification from the beginning was

2410
01:41:16,238 --> 01:41:20,678
only solventless so all of our Farms the

2411
01:41:19,079 --> 01:41:23,639
only thing they could have produced all

2412
01:41:20,679 --> 01:41:26,319
these years was solventless and they are

2413
01:41:23,639 --> 01:41:28,840
really amazing companies coming out and

2414
01:41:26,319 --> 01:41:30,840
working solely with pure certified farms

2415
01:41:28,840 --> 01:41:34,239
and getting it out to the market that

2416
01:41:30,840 --> 01:41:36,840
definitely doesn't solve the the the DCC

2417
01:41:34,238 --> 01:41:39,559
or the BCC issue because the bottleneck

2418
01:41:36,840 --> 01:41:42,319
is a huge problem but um you know being

2419
01:41:39,560 --> 01:41:44,760
able to you know have the fresh frozen

2420
01:41:42,319 --> 01:41:47,000
pounds is also sort of the beginning of

2421
01:41:44,760 --> 01:41:49,639
starting a product it's taking it out of

2422
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:51,279
the biomass it's like you know having

2423
01:41:49,639 --> 01:41:53,319
vegetables fresh at the market and

2424
01:41:51,279 --> 01:41:55,719
getting a penny per pound or a dollar

2425
01:41:53,319 --> 01:41:57,479
per pound or freezing them or beginning

2426
01:41:55,719 --> 01:42:00,319
to preserve them it's the beginning of

2427
01:41:57,479 --> 01:42:03,519
preserving them and making a value added

2428
01:42:00,319 --> 01:42:05,559
product so it's nice that those you know

2429
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:07,679
it's and obviously the tpin are

2430
01:42:05,560 --> 01:42:10,199
something that you know people really

2431
01:42:07,679 --> 01:42:12,399
resonate with and I like that resonate

2432
01:42:10,198 --> 01:42:14,519
has resin in it but you know resonating

2433
01:42:12,399 --> 01:42:17,960
with the tpin and one of the you know

2434
01:42:14,520 --> 01:42:19,760
early tpine mind expansion times was

2435
01:42:17,960 --> 01:42:22,840
going to steep steep hill back in the

2436
01:42:19,760 --> 01:42:24,960
day and talking to Dr kimron and uh Dr

2437
01:42:22,840 --> 01:42:28,000
Kim on that you know Steve pill was just

2438
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:30,399
such an amazing uh mind at the time and

2439
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:33,238
just like a freaky hippie I I really

2440
01:42:30,399 --> 01:42:35,158
loved his uh his depth and his his his

2441
01:42:33,238 --> 01:42:37,439
dedication and also you know Reggie

2442
01:42:35,158 --> 01:42:39,638
godino is is also a really amazing

2443
01:42:37,439 --> 01:42:41,638
person and uh you know everyone that

2444
01:42:39,639 --> 01:42:43,480
came out of that and went went in in

2445
01:42:41,639 --> 01:42:45,760
different directions is something really

2446
01:42:43,479 --> 01:42:47,198
valuable in fact Dr kimron would be

2447
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:49,079
really interesting to have on here I'm

2448
01:42:47,198 --> 01:42:51,000
not sure if he's where where he's at

2449
01:42:49,079 --> 01:42:54,920
these days but he's he's not a doctor at

2450
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:58,800
all okay he does not have a PhD I do not

2451
01:42:54,920 --> 01:43:00,440
believe he was a a uh a a research

2452
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:04,679
instructor at one of the local

2453
01:43:00,439 --> 01:43:06,759
universities right Davis he's actually

2454
01:43:04,679 --> 01:43:09,960
he's not a PhD but I

2455
01:43:06,760 --> 01:43:11,480
think um I you know what I I don't think

2456
01:43:09,960 --> 01:43:14,800
he's a PhD but he was a research

2457
01:43:11,479 --> 01:43:18,079
instructor with Don who is a PhD PhD so

2458
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:20,400
don kind of gets the the bulk of the

2459
01:43:18,079 --> 01:43:22,639
doctor comes in but kimron is without

2460
01:43:20,399 --> 01:43:26,559
question one of the most brilliant

2461
01:43:22,639 --> 01:43:29,359
[ __ ] Minds uh I mean never mind just

2462
01:43:26,560 --> 01:43:31,239
a great dude to hang out with and I when

2463
01:43:29,359 --> 01:43:33,319
I talked earlier about learning I

2464
01:43:31,238 --> 01:43:35,319
learned so much from kimron I learned so

2465
01:43:33,319 --> 01:43:37,079
much from Don like we would be sitting

2466
01:43:35,319 --> 01:43:39,118
in my office smoking hash with some of

2467
01:43:37,079 --> 01:43:41,118
the biggest you know hash makers in the

2468
01:43:39,118 --> 01:43:42,679
country in this country or in the state

2469
01:43:41,118 --> 01:43:43,880
and then I would we would just be high

2470
01:43:42,679 --> 01:43:45,800
and we'd be talking about something and

2471
01:43:43,880 --> 01:43:48,359
we'd knock on the wall and we'd invite

2472
01:43:45,800 --> 01:43:50,480
kimron in and then Don would come in and

2473
01:43:48,359 --> 01:43:52,519
then Reggie be in there and and these

2474
01:43:50,479 --> 01:43:54,519
weed guys would be asking questions

2475
01:43:52,520 --> 01:43:57,880
directly and you were getting this

2476
01:43:54,520 --> 01:43:59,119
really amazing kind of uh build of of

2477
01:43:57,880 --> 01:44:01,480
understanding but I think you're right

2478
01:43:59,118 --> 01:44:04,158
Mark I I don't think kimron is a doctor

2479
01:44:01,479 --> 01:44:06,399
per se but I think he is a uh I think he

2480
01:44:04,158 --> 01:44:09,598
does have a doctorate in something yeah

2481
01:44:06,399 --> 01:44:11,638
so I think he he wor he worked at UC

2482
01:44:09,599 --> 01:44:14,520
Davis and I think he was the guy that

2483
01:44:11,639 --> 01:44:17,400
basically made all the reagents for all

2484
01:44:14,520 --> 01:44:19,840
the undergrad and graduate laborator so

2485
01:44:17,399 --> 01:44:22,559
he's got an incredible wealth of

2486
01:44:19,840 --> 01:44:24,520
experience at doing solution phase

2487
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:26,360
chemistry in terms of like diluting

2488
01:44:24,520 --> 01:44:28,679
stuff and knowing like what the right

2489
01:44:26,359 --> 01:44:31,519
strengths are and stuff like that and

2490
01:44:28,679 --> 01:44:33,760
yeah I I met him so Pinsky introduced me

2491
01:44:31,520 --> 01:44:35,920
to him early on I think he's like oh

2492
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:37,679
okay here's a weed nerd that you can go

2493
01:44:35,920 --> 01:44:40,440
like talk with and everything and so we

2494
01:44:37,679 --> 01:44:43,039
chatted at a high times Cannabis Cup

2495
01:44:40,439 --> 01:44:45,439
booth for several hours and yeah I mean

2496
01:44:43,039 --> 01:44:47,719
I I think that you know what you guys

2497
01:44:45,439 --> 01:44:50,359
started there certainly I think you guys

2498
01:44:47,719 --> 01:44:55,039
were U maybe a little bit ahead of like

2499
01:44:50,359 --> 01:44:55,039
where SC was because I know

2500
01:45:01,118 --> 01:45:05,519
know what they're doing I love their

2501
01:45:03,198 --> 01:45:08,359
customer interface you know when you we

2502
01:45:05,520 --> 01:45:10,560
set up an account at SC it's a it's an

2503
01:45:08,359 --> 01:45:13,279
HTML interface and so you can look at

2504
01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:15,199
your data in real time and see when it

2505
01:45:13,279 --> 01:45:18,279
really comes in and so yeah there's been

2506
01:45:15,198 --> 01:45:22,359
a lot of I think Innovation on the

2507
01:45:18,279 --> 01:45:25,000
customer service side of testing and you

2508
01:45:22,359 --> 01:45:27,399
know when comes to uh just for your to

2509
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:30,719
to speak back to your point SC lab's

2510
01:45:27,399 --> 01:45:34,198
founder Josh was our chemist at Steep

2511
01:45:30,719 --> 01:45:36,599
Hill yeah Josh wer right so we hired

2512
01:45:34,198 --> 01:45:39,399
Josh wer gave him his gave him his first

2513
01:45:36,599 --> 01:45:41,639
job in cannabis and then after being

2514
01:45:39,399 --> 01:45:44,559
with us for about five or six months he

2515
01:45:41,639 --> 01:45:46,239
started to slow down the ability for our

2516
01:45:44,560 --> 01:45:48,159
test results to go out because he had

2517
01:45:46,238 --> 01:45:49,879
started to found an investor to help

2518
01:45:48,158 --> 01:45:52,000
work with him to start another lab to

2519
01:45:49,880 --> 01:45:54,279
compete with us so steill was actually

2520
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:57,679
the first Cannabis Testing Lab in the

2521
01:45:54,279 --> 01:46:00,479
United States um you can you can you can

2522
01:45:57,679 --> 01:46:02,960
go back to a article in uh the East Bay

2523
01:46:00,479 --> 01:46:05,638
Express that David that David Watson

2524
01:46:02,960 --> 01:46:08,760
wrote or no uh what's his name David uh

2525
01:46:05,639 --> 01:46:10,359
uh David the journalist I can't remember

2526
01:46:08,760 --> 01:46:11,840
his name but he he wrote the first

2527
01:46:10,359 --> 01:46:13,799
article because everyone always comes to

2528
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:15,679
me and they're like oh this lab was the

2529
01:46:13,800 --> 01:46:18,840
first or this lab and I'm like listen

2530
01:46:15,679 --> 01:46:22,760
when we opened Steep Hill that was when

2531
01:46:18,840 --> 01:46:26,679
that was when um um Paul dy's uh guy

2532
01:46:22,760 --> 01:46:28,039
there uh that and that did L what's that

2533
01:46:26,679 --> 01:46:30,158
were you were you working with David

2534
01:46:28,039 --> 01:46:33,719
lampack wasn't he one of the original

2535
01:46:30,158 --> 01:46:35,559
folks David David lampac and I um I was

2536
01:46:33,719 --> 01:46:36,960
the the head of the medical cannabis

2537
01:46:35,560 --> 01:46:38,520
Association the director of the medical

2538
01:46:36,960 --> 01:46:41,319
cannabis Association I had just got

2539
01:46:38,520 --> 01:46:44,440
raided I had a dispensary in the Central

2540
01:46:41,319 --> 01:46:46,639
Valley very very aggressive area for

2541
01:46:44,439 --> 01:46:48,158
cannabis at the time um I woke up one

2542
01:46:46,639 --> 01:46:51,400
morning and I saw an article in the

2543
01:46:48,158 --> 01:46:53,679
newspaper that said that uh that the

2544
01:46:51,399 --> 01:46:56,799
city of Oakdale that I lived

2545
01:46:53,679 --> 01:46:58,319
um was was in danger of uh someone being

2546
01:46:56,800 --> 01:46:59,639
able to open a dispensary because they

2547
01:46:58,319 --> 01:47:01,559
didn't have the laws on the books to

2548
01:46:59,639 --> 01:47:03,679
protect them and by the time I put the

2549
01:47:01,560 --> 01:47:05,920
[ __ ] newspaper down I was in the car

2550
01:47:03,679 --> 01:47:08,000
going over to the city to get a business

2551
01:47:05,920 --> 01:47:09,719
license for a dispensary and I got the

2552
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:13,399
license I had the dispensary the

2553
01:47:09,719 --> 01:47:13,399
sheriff's came in hard and heavy I got

2554
01:47:14,760 --> 01:47:19,119
right I know you're in a pretty [ __ ]

2555
01:47:16,760 --> 01:47:20,880
up position um you know the only money I

2556
01:47:19,118 --> 01:47:23,399
had was from like six pounds of weed I

2557

2564
01:47:37,679 --> 01:47:42,880

01:47:49,880 --> 01:47:53,679
said [ __ ] it you know I got to turn to

2570
01:47:51,599 --> 01:47:55,279
activism at this point right I need to

2571
01:47:53,679 --> 01:47:57,359
get some attention on my case I got to

2572
01:47:55,279 --> 01:47:59,880
draw some attention so went and started

2573
01:47:57,359 --> 01:48:02,519
working with Rob there as the Director

2574
01:47:59,880 --> 01:48:04,679
and David lampack was on the board um

2575
01:48:02,520 --> 01:48:06,320
David lampac and I Rob was like hey you

2576
01:48:04,679 --> 01:48:08,079
guys should brainstorm about finding

2577
01:48:06,319 --> 01:48:10,559
ways to create revenue for the for the

2578
01:48:08,079 --> 01:48:12,559
medical Canabis Association me and Dave

2579
01:48:10,560 --> 01:48:15,280
sat down um I went up to Dave's Farm in

2580
01:48:12,560 --> 01:48:17,159
mesino met with them sat down and kind

2581
01:48:15,279 --> 01:48:19,399
of just came up with some ideas one of

2582
01:48:17,158 --> 01:48:21,719
them was why don't we introduce quality

2583
01:48:19,399 --> 01:48:23,759
control to cannabis and the reason was

2584
01:48:21,719 --> 01:48:26,439
is because I had just got in an argument

2585
01:48:23,760 --> 01:48:28,679
with the sheriff because he was doing a

2586
01:48:26,439 --> 01:48:30,319
a news conference and saying that you

2587
01:48:28,679 --> 01:48:32,880
know cannabis is dangerous because it's

2588
01:48:30,319 --> 01:48:34,519
tainted it could have other drugs in it

2589
01:48:32,880 --> 01:48:36,239
so in me and Dave's conversation I'm

2590
01:48:34,520 --> 01:48:37,560
like you know and this [ __ ] sheriff

2591
01:48:36,238 --> 01:48:38,919
is saying there's other drugs and he's

2592
01:48:37,560 --> 01:48:41,119
like you know what there's no other

2593
01:48:38,920 --> 01:48:43,039
[ __ ] drugs in weed like who the [ __ ]

2594
01:48:41,118 --> 01:48:44,960
gives you other free drugs in your weed

2595
01:48:43,039 --> 01:48:46,158
like that's [ __ ] you know and and

2596
01:48:44,960 --> 01:48:47,679
and Dave's like well the only way we

2597
01:48:46,158 --> 01:48:49,839
could prove it is if we did testing and

2598
01:48:47,679 --> 01:48:51,760
I'm like H so I walk up to the dryer

2599
01:48:49,840 --> 01:48:54,039
race board and I'm like testing and that

2600
01:48:51,760 --> 01:48:55,840
was on the board you know and and and I

2601
01:48:54,039 --> 01:48:57,519
think I actually have in a phone

2602
01:48:55,840 --> 01:48:59,319
somewhere I think I actually have it on

2603
01:48:57,520 --> 01:49:01,840
one of my computers that picture of that

2604
01:48:59,319 --> 01:49:03,920
dry erase board that says testing it

2605
01:49:01,840 --> 01:49:06,159
says all these different ideas on it so

2606
01:49:03,920 --> 01:49:07,719
when we left there um we kind of just

2607
01:49:06,158 --> 01:49:10,158
said hey you know let's try to do some

2608
01:49:07,719 --> 01:49:12,560
testing uh I I left Dave and said that's

2609
01:49:10,158 --> 01:49:14,879
what we need to do well that [ __ ]

2610
01:49:12,560 --> 01:49:17,159
about five days later calls me up and he

2611
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:19,920
says hey I got us a space in Emoryville

2612
01:49:17,158 --> 01:49:23,039
we're going down to [ __ ] uh we're

2613
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:25,359
going down to pick a GC up up in the bay

2614
01:49:23,039 --> 01:49:27,118
at the at the maker and I think it was

2615
01:49:25,359 --> 01:49:30,960
uh I don't know who our first GC was

2616
01:49:27,118 --> 01:49:32,799
from but um we go and we we literally

2617
01:49:30,960 --> 01:49:34,760
yeah it's agilant we drove down to

2618
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:36,960
agilant and I'm like what the [ __ ]

2619
01:49:34,760 --> 01:49:38,840
going on he picks me up we I'm in the

2620
01:49:36,960 --> 01:49:40,960
bay he picks me up we drive to agilant

2621
01:49:38,840 --> 01:49:42,800
we pick up this [ __ ] machine we don't

2622
01:49:40,960 --> 01:49:44,359
know what the [ __ ] we're doing he brings

2623
01:49:42,800 --> 01:49:45,840
me back to this spot that we leased

2624
01:49:44,359 --> 01:49:48,439
which ended up being the original steep

2625
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:53,079
hill we brought the machine in we found

2626
01:49:48,439 --> 01:49:57,279
a chemist on um on Craigslist and then

2627
01:49:53,079 --> 01:50:00,719
lo and behold etn and Debbie got

2628
01:49:57,279 --> 01:50:05,319
involved and uh uh what was his name

2629
01:50:00,719 --> 01:50:07,719
John Gilmore yeah yeah John Gilmore just

2630
01:50:05,319 --> 01:50:10,599
put up the money and approach John

2631
01:50:07,719 --> 01:50:13,239
Gilmore went to Paul daily and said

2632
01:50:10,599 --> 01:50:15,279
these guys have a good idea um I'll put

2633
01:50:13,238 --> 01:50:18,759
the money behind it would you be willing

2634
01:50:15,279 --> 01:50:21,759
to help these guys and Paul Daly who was

2635
01:50:18,760 --> 01:50:24,400
working with uh Sasha shulan at the time

2636
01:50:21,760 --> 01:50:26,280
Paul Dy came over and that's how we met

2637
01:50:24,399 --> 01:50:28,519
Sasha and sha Sasha came and they both

2638
01:50:26,279 --> 01:50:30,679
were like oh you guys are sweet little

2639
01:50:28,520 --> 01:50:32,480
kids have a seat and they sat us down

2640
01:50:30,679 --> 01:50:35,760
and they looked at all of our [ __ ] and

2641
01:50:32,479 --> 01:50:39,319
and thank you etn because our numbers

2642
01:50:35,760 --> 01:50:41,760
were trash etn was paying us to do tests

2643
01:50:39,319 --> 01:50:44,039
and our numbers were trash right so etn

2644
01:50:41,760 --> 01:50:45,639
Ln ultimately seated Ste pill Steve

2645
01:50:44,039 --> 01:50:47,880
D'Angelo at Harbor Side seated Ste

2646
01:50:45,639 --> 01:50:50,000
seated Ste pill these guys we didn't

2647
01:50:47,880 --> 01:50:52,239
know what we were doing but then once

2648
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:54,719
Paul got involved and Paul came in we

2649
01:50:52,238 --> 01:50:57,039
had the equipment Paul was able to reach

2650
01:50:54,719 --> 01:50:59,480
out to the rest of the community um at

2651
01:50:57,039 --> 01:51:01,719
that point you know we got everybody

2652
01:50:59,479 --> 01:51:03,718
involved I mean I think every single

2653
01:51:01,719 --> 01:51:06,279
cannabis chemist of any type at that

2654
01:51:03,719 --> 01:51:08,760
point were so interested from mulam all

2655
01:51:06,279 --> 01:51:10,639
the way into Eli and we had the network

2656
01:51:08,760 --> 01:51:12,599
to kind of get these guys involved every

2657
01:51:10,639 --> 01:51:15,639
one of those guys got involved in one

2658
01:51:12,599 --> 01:51:18,039
way or another at thean a lot of people

2659
01:51:15,639 --> 01:51:21,800
um and I always say that that it's crazy

2660
01:51:18,039 --> 01:51:24,000
that Microsoft essentially seated Steep

2661
01:51:21,800 --> 01:51:26,599
Hill because the money that John Gilmore

2662
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:29,800
made from selling Sun systems is what

2663
01:51:26,599 --> 01:51:33,239
funded Steep Hill facts so facts we

2664
01:51:29,800 --> 01:51:35,320
oddly enough Microsoft funded the

2665
01:51:33,238 --> 01:51:37,359
quality control component of cannabis in

2666
01:51:35,319 --> 01:51:39,238
the entire industry like Steep Hill came

2667
01:51:37,359 --> 01:51:43,719
in and also a

2668
01:51:39,238 --> 01:51:47,319
Sasha Sasha shulan um component is very

2669
01:51:43,719 --> 01:51:49,520
significant very significant really cool

2670
01:51:47,319 --> 01:51:53,000
can't I mean I can't even I'm so I'm

2671
01:51:49,520 --> 01:51:55,280
more honored to be name to be thanked in

2672
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:57,078
those books that Paul wrote than

2673
01:51:55,279 --> 01:51:59,238
anything else that I've ever done in my

2674
01:51:57,078 --> 01:52:00,920
career ever you know that to me like

2675
01:51:59,238 --> 01:52:03,519
having those books up there and I take

2676
01:52:00,920 --> 01:52:05,679
those out and I'm like just seeing my

2677
01:52:03,520 --> 01:52:08,000
stupid little name in there as like a

2678
01:52:05,679 --> 01:52:10,760
shout out of somebody involved that to

2679
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:13,039
me and it's serendipitous it's like how

2680
01:52:10,760 --> 01:52:15,000
would it have come together and then

2681
01:52:13,039 --> 01:52:17,800
after that when I would take MDA I'd be

2682
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:20,719
like yeah you know like the molecule so

2683
01:52:17,800 --> 01:52:22,279
like all this comes so full circle and

2684
01:52:20,719 --> 01:52:24,279
and even with the fresh frozen thing

2685
01:52:22,279 --> 01:52:26,399
even even with the Legends thing now I

2686
01:52:24,279 --> 01:52:28,000
feel like it's just an energy that's

2687
01:52:26,399 --> 01:52:30,238
that's outside of all of and we all know

2688
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:32,639
it it's the plant it's feeding us this

2689
01:52:30,238 --> 01:52:33,598
energy we're just a conduit to this [ __ ]

2690
01:52:32,639 --> 01:52:35,840
because I don't know where I get the

2691
01:52:33,599 --> 01:52:38,319
energy to do half this stuff so it's

2692
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:40,639
it's definitely you know when I look at

2693
01:52:38,319 --> 01:52:44,799
we look at the last year how the [ __ ]

2694
01:52:40,639 --> 01:52:47,719
did we survive that year and come

2695
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:49,840
out talking to Kevin who was here with

2696
01:52:47,719 --> 01:52:52,198
me you know we both were sitting here

2697
01:52:49,840 --> 01:52:55,440
struggling working our asses off and

2698
01:52:52,198 --> 01:52:56,759
then somehow some way it happens and it

2699
01:52:55,439 --> 01:52:59,039
clicks and everything's moving and the

2700
01:52:56,760 --> 01:53:01,520
work that you did before happens and I I

2701
01:52:59,039 --> 01:53:03,760
mean I'm just rambling but this is the

2702
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:05,840
plant this is that compound that made

2703
01:53:03,760 --> 01:53:07,599
this happen and that and it's done it

2704
01:53:05,840 --> 01:53:10,560
with other compounds because the group

2705
01:53:07,599 --> 01:53:11,400
of people are compound guys which is

2706
01:53:10,560 --> 01:53:14,840
really

2707
01:53:11,399 --> 01:53:17,158
weird was Jeffrey rer and Samantha

2708
01:53:14,840 --> 01:53:18,800
Miller in there or is Jeffrey rurn and

2709
01:53:17,158 --> 01:53:22,679
Samantha Miller came after a little

2710
01:53:18,800 --> 01:53:24,639
after that or je Jeffrey came in um so

2711
01:53:22,679 --> 01:53:28,480
it where it went from it went from from

2712
01:53:24,639 --> 01:53:31,359
Paul Daly then Jan Maru got involved on

2713
01:53:28,479 --> 01:53:33,559
the micro side because he was at a UCSF

2714
01:53:31,359 --> 01:53:36,000
so then we were able to expand micro

2715
01:53:33,560 --> 01:53:38,280
testing um and it was about the at about

2716
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:41,920
the same time that those asilis patients

2717
01:53:38,279 --> 01:53:43,960
had died from consuming medical cannabis

2718
01:53:41,920 --> 01:53:46,560
and the and the the people that were

2719
01:53:43,960 --> 01:53:48,639
researching the death went back to the

2720
01:53:46,560 --> 01:53:50,960
person's house got the Cannabis tested

2721
01:53:48,639 --> 01:53:53,039
it saw that it had aspergillosis and

2722
01:53:50,960 --> 01:53:54,560
fusarium and then they figured out that

2723
01:53:53,039 --> 01:53:56,359
that's how the immune deficient patient

2724
01:53:54,560 --> 01:53:57,639
died that was one of the things that

2725
01:53:56,359 --> 01:54:00,158
actually allowed us to get a lot of

2726
01:53:57,639 --> 01:54:01,880
support from San Francisco to be able to

2727
01:54:00,158 --> 01:54:04,158
push Cannabis Testing forward when we

2728
01:54:01,880 --> 01:54:06,319
did this this is when dispensaries were

2729
01:54:04,158 --> 01:54:08,598
getting raided left and right you know

2730
01:54:06,319 --> 01:54:10,279
so we kind of came out and we're like ah

2731
01:54:08,599 --> 01:54:12,279
[ __ ] you know me and Dave sat there one

2732
01:54:10,279 --> 01:54:14,238
day and I'm like if you think being a

2733
01:54:12,279 --> 01:54:16,198
grower is a Target and if I think being

2734
01:54:14,238 --> 01:54:18,319
a dispensary owner was a Target we just

2735
01:54:16,198 --> 01:54:20,399
made the biggest [ __ ] Target because

2736
01:54:18,319 --> 01:54:22,039
we're dragging mulam into this we're

2737
01:54:20,399 --> 01:54:24,519
dragging all these other chemists into

2738
01:54:22,039 --> 01:54:26,639
this now and the government hates them

2739
01:54:24,520 --> 01:54:28,119
and and I for a minute there I thought

2740
01:54:26,639 --> 01:54:29,800
we were going to get raided and wiped

2741
01:54:28,118 --> 01:54:32,359
out I thought they were going to hit the

2742
01:54:29,800 --> 01:54:33,480
chemist with a $10,000 per sample and

2743
01:54:32,359 --> 01:54:35,719
they were going to wipe the whole thing

2744
01:54:33,479 --> 01:54:37,439
the [ __ ] out but luckily for us they

2745
01:54:35,719 --> 01:54:39,719
were too focused on other things and I

2746
01:54:37,439 --> 01:54:41,039
think that the fact that testing got

2747
01:54:39,719 --> 01:54:43,078
through not because of steep hill

2748
01:54:41,039 --> 01:54:46,760
because of everybody that got involved

2749
01:54:43,078 --> 01:54:48,840
you know SE Labs later on um you know um

2750
01:54:46,760 --> 01:54:50,679
Halen all these guys that got the lab I

2751
01:54:48,840 --> 01:54:53,599
worked with the lab I worked with

2752
01:54:50,679 --> 01:54:56,118
stopped working because it was just so

2753
01:54:53,599 --> 01:54:59,279
risky their investors didn't want to

2754
01:54:56,118 --> 01:55:01,559
take the risks on their 6 uvh plc's

2755
01:54:59,279 --> 01:55:03,439
because they were the least etc etc you

2756
01:55:01,560 --> 01:55:06,280
know how it goes and that's an ungodly

2757
01:55:03,439 --> 01:55:09,839
amount of money so I mean I brought Arno

2758
01:55:06,279 --> 01:55:12,679
over and the the reason that I worked on

2759
01:55:09,840 --> 01:55:15,560
a suspended solution was because of the

2760
01:55:12,679 --> 01:55:18,960
$10,000 fine per test and so we worked

2761
01:55:15,560 --> 01:55:21,239
with Arno who did the testing solutions

2762
01:55:18,960 --> 01:55:23,520
for the Dutch government brought him

2763
01:55:21,238 --> 01:55:25,598
stat side and worked with our lab after

2764
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:27,639
we invert we fired Steve Hill because we

2765
01:55:25,599 --> 01:55:30,440
weren't happy with the numbers so you

2766
01:55:27,639 --> 01:55:33,279
know I worked then with uh Ethan Russo

2767
01:55:30,439 --> 01:55:35,598
helped find me Arno and then Arno we

2768
01:55:33,279 --> 01:55:38,679
worked on actually getting cannabis

2769
01:55:35,599 --> 01:55:41,119
suspended in 100% alcohol so that now it

2770
01:55:38,679 --> 01:55:45,679
was a testing solution so now it was

2771
01:55:41,118 --> 01:55:47,319
legal to take into a dispensary I mean

2772
01:55:45,679 --> 01:55:50,078
pardon me into a laboratory and you

2773
01:55:47,319 --> 01:55:53,399
would no longer be subject to that

2774
01:55:50,078 --> 01:55:55,840
$110,000 fine per test so there were

2775
01:55:53,399 --> 01:55:57,519
mental steps along the way once you took

2776
01:55:55,840 --> 01:56:00,078
those initial steps that many of us

2777
01:55:57,520 --> 01:56:01,400
around saw that we needed to fill that

2778
01:56:00,078 --> 01:56:03,679
or now

2779
01:56:01,399 --> 01:56:06,920
standards no it took it took a village

2780
01:56:03,679 --> 01:56:09,279
man it took

2781
01:56:06,920 --> 01:56:12,480
everybody we were there I'll go ahead

2782
01:56:09,279 --> 01:56:15,078
Sam Addison what was the name of the

2783
01:56:12,479 --> 01:56:19,319
other lab besides Steep Hill that

2784
01:56:15,078 --> 01:56:21,880
eventually fused together T Talent yeah

2785
01:56:19,319 --> 01:56:22,799
Halen that's where that's where Hal

2786
01:56:21,880 --> 01:56:24,520
that's right

2787
01:56:22,800 --> 01:56:27,000
yeah Halen that's where kimron and Dawn

2788
01:56:24,520 --> 01:56:29,199
came from which was sort of a it was

2789
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:31,520
built out of UC Davis which was

2790
01:56:29,198 --> 01:56:35,319
interesting um you know they were a UC

2791
01:56:31,520 --> 01:56:37,440
Davis lab that came in a bit after SC uh

2792
01:56:35,319 --> 01:56:39,078
and they they pushed things very far

2793
01:56:37,439 --> 01:56:41,359
like they they were the the one main

2794
01:56:39,078 --> 01:56:42,759
reason why I think the merger the merger

2795
01:56:41,359 --> 01:56:44,519
with them is what helped Steep Hill

2796
01:56:42,760 --> 01:56:46,239
survive to the point where he was able

2797
01:56:44,520 --> 01:56:47,639
to rip off all of the founders and be

2798
01:56:46,238 --> 01:56:51,359
the company that is

2799
01:56:47,639 --> 01:56:53,880
now that's that's really the juice that

2800
01:56:51,359 --> 01:56:56,039
they had there right after that was when

2801
01:56:53,880 --> 01:56:58,279
we started our certification because we

2802
01:56:56,039 --> 01:56:59,880
started our certification based off the

2803
01:56:58,279 --> 01:57:02,439
testing that was happening and one of

2804
01:56:59,880 --> 01:57:05,039
the early you guys at Steve pill did a

2805
01:57:02,439 --> 01:57:08,919
sleeper study I believe where you went

2806
01:57:05,039 --> 01:57:08,920
out and bought a bunch of pens and

2807
01:57:14,920 --> 01:57:19,399
then and then you know there was like

2808
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:21,760
you know talk about people getting

2809
01:57:19,399 --> 01:57:23,598
lesions and their you know in their

2810
01:57:21,760 --> 01:57:25,239
their you know when it was really bad

2811
01:57:23,599 --> 01:57:27,840
and and getting lesions in their their

2812
01:57:25,238 --> 01:57:30,078
lungs and whatnot and uh clean green

2813
01:57:27,840 --> 01:57:32,920
started you know a certification down

2814
01:57:30,078 --> 01:57:35,799
there Chris and then we started it right

2815
01:57:32,920 --> 01:57:38,359
after that and ours was free because we

2816
01:57:35,800 --> 01:57:40,760
were farmers and producers and we just

2817
01:57:38,359 --> 01:57:42,839
recognized that people that were caring

2818
01:57:40,760 --> 01:57:45,159
for the Earth and bringing in living

2819
01:57:42,840 --> 01:57:47,400
soils and putting their plants into the

2820
01:57:45,158 --> 01:57:48,679
Earth and being a positive impact on

2821
01:57:47,399 --> 01:57:51,000
their it was kind of like the revelation

2822
01:57:48,679 --> 01:57:52,760
of finding out cannabis was good for you

2823
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:55,359
the revelation of real realizing that

2824
01:57:52,760 --> 01:57:57,760
you could grow cannabis in harmony with

2825
01:57:55,359 --> 01:58:00,439
the Earth and then produce resin that

2826
01:57:57,760 --> 01:58:03,320
was of higher quality than anything else

2827
01:58:00,439 --> 01:58:05,439
it was this amazing full circle thing so

2828
01:58:03,319 --> 01:58:09,799
the revelation of Laboratories and

2829
01:58:05,439 --> 01:58:13,039
testing as ill as they are as we stated

2830
01:58:09,800 --> 01:58:15,639
earlier you know did help bring cannabis

2831
01:58:13,039 --> 01:58:20,800
forward and then when you add in heavy

2832
01:58:15,639 --> 01:58:22,679
metals now and uh um uh pesticide

2833
01:58:20,800 --> 01:58:24,719
residues and glyphosate residues you

2834
01:58:22,679 --> 01:58:27,599
know that that really also completes the

2835
01:58:24,719 --> 01:58:31,039
picture I would love for you know Canada

2836
01:58:27,599 --> 01:58:33,599
to learn how to uh get rid of their

2837
01:58:31,039 --> 01:58:36,198
microbial testing up here and get more

2838
01:58:33,599 --> 01:58:37,679
towards just human pathogenic testing

2839
01:58:36,198 --> 01:58:39,678
and I think that might be one of the

2840
01:58:37,679 --> 01:58:42,520
things that actually saves the Cannabis

2841
01:58:39,679 --> 01:58:45,199
industry up here in Canada because

2842
01:58:42,520 --> 01:58:46,920
you'll be hard pressed to find quality

2843
01:58:45,198 --> 01:58:49,198
cannabis coming out of any licensed

2844
01:58:46,920 --> 01:58:51,520
producer in Canada because of the

2845
01:58:49,198 --> 01:58:53,479
microbial testing that's required which

2846
01:58:51,520 --> 01:58:56,400
is even more stringent than when it

2847
01:58:53,479 --> 01:58:58,519
started so now you have all kinds of

2848
01:58:56,399 --> 01:59:00,920
different different things that they can

2849
01:58:58,520 --> 01:59:02,840
do and gamma radiation is one and light

2850
01:59:00,920 --> 01:59:04,399
light therapy is another and every

2851
01:59:02,840 --> 01:59:06,840
single one of those things diminishes

2852
01:59:04,399 --> 01:59:08,759
the turpins and the whole entire purpose

2853
01:59:06,840 --> 01:59:11,760
of this conversation and rosin and

2854
01:59:08,760 --> 01:59:13,119
everything is how to bring tpin up so

2855
01:59:11,760 --> 01:59:15,320
it's it's almost like bringing

2856
01:59:13,118 --> 01:59:17,960
everything up so that we can get smacked

2857
01:59:15,319 --> 01:59:20,319
in the face with a brick wall so I I

2858
01:59:17,960 --> 01:59:23,000
would love for you know the intelligence

2859
01:59:20,319 --> 01:59:25,479
of this community to continue to reach

2860
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:27,800
out to people in Canada and to different

2861
01:59:25,479 --> 01:59:30,678
policy makers as we you know continue to

2862
01:59:27,800 --> 01:59:33,840
form our federal legislation or make

2863
01:59:30,679 --> 01:59:36,960
sure in America you know as as those

2864
01:59:33,840 --> 01:59:38,719
Federal uh uh legislations get formed

2865
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:42,319
that you know you don't get crushed with

2866
01:59:38,719 --> 01:59:44,078
the microbial um you know dilemma let's

2867
01:59:42,319 --> 01:59:45,960
say so I you know that's just one of the

2868
01:59:44,078 --> 01:59:48,319
things in one of the things in our in

2869
01:59:45,960 --> 01:59:50,679
our area also packaging and trash and

2870
01:59:48,319 --> 01:59:54,118
all those types of things so yeah yeah

2871
01:59:50,679 --> 01:59:56,920
there's a lot to Community regulation is

2872
01:59:54,118 --> 01:59:58,759
tough it's it's they try to use uh an

2873
01:59:56,920 --> 02:00:00,319
approach where you know they're

2874
01:59:58,760 --> 02:00:02,920
protecting the people but at the same

2875
02:00:00,319 --> 02:00:04,799
time it it never translates into that

2876
02:00:02,920 --> 02:00:06,960
it's always it's always so limiting I

2877
02:00:04,800 --> 02:00:09,920
mean who the [ __ ] in their right mind

2878
02:00:06,960 --> 02:00:10,840
would limit microbes in a growroom the

2879
02:00:09,920 --> 02:00:14,719
[ __ ] are you

2880
02:00:10,840 --> 02:00:17,279
doing like in the have to there's tons

2881
02:00:14,719 --> 02:00:19,359
of biological inputs that you can't use

2882
02:00:17,279 --> 02:00:21,800
legally in your grow as far as soil

2883
02:00:19,359 --> 02:00:24,920
inputs too you have to have everything

2884
02:00:21,800 --> 02:00:26,840
uh approved every single input which in

2885
02:00:24,920 --> 02:00:28,880
some cases can be extremely difficult

2886
02:00:26,840 --> 02:00:30,880
you know things like em and mic or risal

2887
02:00:28,880 --> 02:00:33,639
fungi and those things for for a long

2888
02:00:30,880 --> 02:00:36,000
time were not allowed over the Border a

2889
02:00:33,639 --> 02:00:38,560
lot of them are becoming available and

2890
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:43,760
are being used and there there are some

2891
02:00:38,560 --> 02:00:43,760
really Forward Thinking LPS in Canada

2892
02:00:45,920 --> 02:00:51,560
doing doing work to make it happen so

2893
02:00:48,399 --> 02:00:54,238
big up to them and uh and so yeah I know

2894
02:00:51,560 --> 02:00:56,520
there's there and moving forward it's

2895
02:00:54,238 --> 02:00:59,479
it's important I mean I think that uh

2896
02:00:56,520 --> 02:01:01,760
like you said we're we're trying to find

2897
02:00:59,479 --> 02:01:04,479
as much as we can in the plant and that

2898
02:01:01,760 --> 02:01:07,599
leads us to to to rosin that leads us to

2899
02:01:04,479 --> 02:01:10,638
melt in the most purest form um and it's

2900
02:01:07,599 --> 02:01:12,560
and it's just in order to get there for

2901
02:01:10,639 --> 02:01:13,880
so many years it was just isolation and

2902
02:01:12,560 --> 02:01:16,199
now that it's so open and there's so

2903
02:01:13,880 --> 02:01:19,078
many distractions and there's so much

2904
02:01:16,198 --> 02:01:22,039
going on the the cream is rising to the

2905
02:01:19,078 --> 02:01:23,359
top like you're when I you know I'm on

2906
02:01:22,039 --> 02:01:25,399
Instagram all the time just posting

2907
02:01:23,359 --> 02:01:26,920
stupid [ __ ] and just kind of you know

2908
02:01:25,399 --> 02:01:28,319
it's it's a distraction that allows me

2909
02:01:26,920 --> 02:01:30,199
to kind of take away from the work and

2910
02:01:28,319 --> 02:01:32,279
the other stuff but in the same time you

2911
02:01:30,198 --> 02:01:34,559
see people that are so invested that

2912
02:01:32,279 --> 02:01:36,000
think that our industry is in there and

2913
02:01:34,560 --> 02:01:37,960
it's like if anyone thinks our industry

2914
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:40,679
is in Instagram you're out of your

2915
02:01:37,960 --> 02:01:43,039
[ __ ] mind because you may see one

2916
02:01:40,679 --> 02:01:46,158
thing but for us what our industry is to

2917
02:01:43,039 --> 02:01:48,639
me is when I drive up and and I'm trying

2918
02:01:46,158 --> 02:01:51,039
to find my way to this piece of property

2919
02:01:48,639 --> 02:01:52,800
and when I get to the property and I get

2920
02:01:51,039 --> 02:01:55,000
there and I see the green houses and I

2921
02:01:52,800 --> 02:01:56,639
see the plants and I you know and you

2922
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:58,760
get the tour and you see everything and

2923
02:01:56,639 --> 02:02:00,480
then you get to the lab tour maybe and

2924
02:01:58,760 --> 02:02:02,320
you see the the material and you're with

2925
02:02:00,479 --> 02:02:04,319
the people it's like that's what this

2926
02:02:02,319 --> 02:02:05,840
industry is about it's and that's what I

2927
02:02:04,319 --> 02:02:07,279
love about Legends and I love about what

2928
02:02:05,840 --> 02:02:09,560
we're going to do we're going to put

2929
02:02:07,279 --> 02:02:12,759
those 25 makers with their with their

2930
02:02:09,560 --> 02:02:16,360
guests in a room with no [ __ ] phone

2931
02:02:12,760 --> 02:02:18,119
no camera and and that to me is like

2932
02:02:16,359 --> 02:02:19,559
every person I've talked to on the phone

2933
02:02:18,118 --> 02:02:22,000
that when I call them to tell them about

2934
02:02:19,560 --> 02:02:23,440
the event they're like oh [ __ ] thank God

2935
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:26,560
and you know the only place where we get

2936
02:02:23,439 --> 02:02:27,719
that nowadays is at a comedy show

2937
02:02:26,560 --> 02:02:29,480
because when you go to a comedy show

2938
02:02:27,719 --> 02:02:30,920
they take your phone now because they

2939
02:02:29,479 --> 02:02:32,638
don't want you filming and showing the

2940
02:02:30,920 --> 02:02:35,319
person's comedy before they're ready to

2941
02:02:32,639 --> 02:02:37,359
release it and I think that by taking

2942
02:02:35,319 --> 02:02:38,759
that away from it and removing that from

2943
02:02:37,359 --> 02:02:40,920
it and putting people more in front of

2944
02:02:38,760 --> 02:02:40,920
each

2945
02:02:44,920 --> 02:02:49,319
other of love and kindness to push the

2946
02:02:47,399 --> 02:02:52,039
message of working together because the

2947
02:02:49,319 --> 02:02:54,840
more that and and of health and people

2948
02:02:52,039 --> 02:02:57,198
Health you know gut health uh foot

2949
02:02:54,840 --> 02:02:58,560
Health uh all those things that [ __ ] is

2950
02:02:57,198 --> 02:03:00,319
going to make it so you can keep doing

2951
02:02:58,560 --> 02:03:01,800
what you're doing for longer you're

2952
02:03:00,319 --> 02:03:03,399

2953
02:03:01,800 --> 02:03:05,199
these blessings to everybody else do you

2954
02:03:03,399 --> 02:03:07,319

2955
02:03:05,198 --> 02:03:09,519

2959
02:03:14,399 --> 02:03:18,319

02:03:22,039 --> 02:03:26,039
industry we're seeing Health become more

2964
02:03:24,039 --> 02:03:27,399
important and it's starting to align

2965
02:03:26,039 --> 02:03:29,479
with what we've always known is that

2966
02:03:27,399 --> 02:03:31,000
cannabis is healthy and it's a healthy

2967
02:03:29,479 --> 02:03:32,839
way of life and that's like we're

2968
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:36,800
getting to sit in that position we sit

2969
02:03:32,840 --> 02:03:38,760
now as cannabis guys I sit now with like

2970
02:03:36,800 --> 02:03:40,599

look at and talk to that are that are

2979
02:04:04,520 --> 02:04:09,119
the top fitness guys in the country and

2980
02:04:06,479 --> 02:04:11,558
they dab or they use ures or they use

2981
02:04:09,118 --> 02:04:13,839
cannabis or they're using CBD so it's

2982
02:04:11,559 --> 02:04:16,840
all growing you

2983
02:04:13,840 --> 02:04:18,559
know yeah like it's because the you know

2984
02:04:16,840 --> 02:04:20,559
it's because it it touches the you know

2985
02:04:18,559 --> 02:04:22,119
the EC right it's just let's face it

2986
02:04:20,559 --> 02:04:24,079
it's it's the same you know when you're

2987
02:04:22,118 --> 02:04:26,558
when you're running you're you're the

2988
02:04:24,078 --> 02:04:28,599
same receptors are firing off and you're

2989
02:04:26,559 --> 02:04:30,400
you're feeling these same exact things

2990
02:04:28,599 --> 02:04:32,719
and and that's why we're we're drawn to

2991
02:04:30,399 --> 02:04:34,558
them and you're right I think um you

2992
02:04:32,719 --> 02:04:36,719
know I've always looked at cannabis as

2993
02:04:34,559 --> 02:04:38,360
some sort of a biohacking agent like

2994
02:04:36,719 --> 02:04:40,439
you're you're you're isolating these

2995
02:04:38,359 --> 02:04:42,558
compounds and you can put them back

2996
02:04:40,439 --> 02:04:44,558
together or you can allow the you know

2997
02:04:42,559 --> 02:04:47,599
Nature's chemist as I call it to kind of

2998
02:04:44,559 --> 02:04:50,480
guide you and let specific cultivars um

2999
02:04:47,599 --> 02:04:53,078
do it for you so totally agree I think

3000
02:04:50,479 --> 02:04:57,279
there's a lot to to look at and and you

3001
02:04:53,078 --> 02:04:59,439
know explore in that alone you know it's

3002
02:04:57,279 --> 02:05:01,399
cool to see people you know excited

3003
02:04:59,439 --> 02:05:03,399
about cannaboids and cannaboid therapy

3004
02:05:01,399 --> 02:05:05,839
in general it's it's been I mean I can't

3005
02:05:03,399 --> 02:05:08,000
imagine what Sam has seen through his

3006
02:05:05,840 --> 02:05:10,279
time you know let alone what we're

3007
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:13,439
seeing right now in contemporary times

3008
02:05:10,279 --> 02:05:16,800
you know I think weed workouts are are

3009
02:05:13,439 --> 02:05:19,558
key and and I think the ganja has to be

3010
02:05:16,800 --> 02:05:22,119
regeneratively grown and and healthy to

3011
02:05:19,559 --> 02:05:24,039
begin with otherwise you know just

3012
02:05:22,118 --> 02:05:26,598
processing the residue chemicals and

3013
02:05:24,039 --> 02:05:29,719
that really doesn't serve you so in in

3014
02:05:26,599 --> 02:05:31,960
moving forward like health and ganja go

3015
02:05:29,719 --> 02:05:34,399
together we also started demm pure

3016
02:05:31,960 --> 02:05:37,679
athletes so we have a whole other realm

3017
02:05:34,399 --> 02:05:40,238
called deure athletes where you know a

3018
02:05:37,679 --> 02:05:43,639
lot of you know top athletes in the

3019
02:05:40,238 --> 02:05:46,000
world don't really understand nutrition

3020
02:05:43,639 --> 02:05:48,639
and they don't really understand

3021
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:51,198
detoxing specifically injury

3022
02:05:48,639 --> 02:05:53,118
healing injury heal and unfortunately in

3023
02:05:51,198 --> 02:05:55,799
a lot of professional sports you can't

3024
02:05:53,118 --> 02:05:59,238
bring in cannabis because they still

3025
02:05:55,800 --> 02:06:02,760
testing THC levels for performance which

3026
02:05:59,238 --> 02:06:04,558
is totally ridiculous but a lot of uh

3027
02:06:02,760 --> 02:06:06,760
top athletes are turning towards

3028
02:06:04,559 --> 02:06:10,360
cannabis during their downtime knowing

3029
02:06:06,760 --> 02:06:13,280
that it's going to out of their system

3030
02:06:10,359 --> 02:06:14,759
within two months so they're turning to

3031
02:06:13,279 --> 02:06:16,800
anything that they can to be able to

3032
02:06:14,760 --> 02:06:19,440
utilize plant medicine because they know

3033
02:06:16,800 --> 02:06:22,800
that their healing is going to be in

3034
02:06:19,439 --> 02:06:26,118
half they know that when they go back

3035
02:06:22,800 --> 02:06:27,239
into the doctor check that bone injury

3036
02:06:26,118 --> 02:06:28,880
when they're going to be putting on

3037
02:06:27,238 --> 02:06:32,158
another cast those don't have to go on

3038
02:06:28,880 --> 02:06:34,400
and get that second cast they can go and

3039
02:06:32,158 --> 02:06:36,558
start working on their livelihood which

3040
02:06:34,399 --> 02:06:38,920
absolutely imperative and I just think

3041
02:06:36,559 --> 02:06:40,920
it's crazy that many doctors don't even

3042
02:06:38,920 --> 02:06:42,760
ask about that fast healing or how they

3043
02:06:40,920 --> 02:06:45,039
even got there nor do their sponsors

3044
02:06:42,760 --> 02:06:47,400
even want to know or Chinese bone break

3045
02:06:45,039 --> 02:06:49,000
soup and Bone knitting and Bone healing

3046
02:06:47,399 --> 02:06:50,839
together bones actually come together

3047
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:53,039
pretty fast which comes back into the

3048
02:06:50,840 --> 02:06:54,360
compound of plant medicine which is

3049
02:06:53,039 --> 02:06:55,880
exactly what you all are just talking

3050
02:06:54,359 --> 02:06:58,118
about I've been listening but I've been

3051
02:06:55,880 --> 02:07:01,440
doing a lot of work so been really

3052
02:06:58,118 --> 02:07:04,558
awesome listening to how ironic is it

3053
02:07:01,439 --> 02:07:07,558
that the only sport that allows cannabis

3054
02:07:04,559 --> 02:07:09,960
now is the most brutal sport that you

3055
02:07:07,559 --> 02:07:12,520
could be involved in so the UFC is the

3056
02:07:09,960 --> 02:07:14,800
only sport that allows you to test

3057
02:07:12,520 --> 02:07:17,880
positive for THC and you're and you're

3058
02:07:14,800 --> 02:07:19,159
not banned from the sport what how come

3059
02:07:17,880 --> 02:07:21,719
and when I think about it I'm like how

3060
02:07:19,158 --> 02:07:23,399
come well it's a neuroprotectant

3061
02:07:21,719 --> 02:07:25,279
cannabis is a [ __ ] neuroprotectant

3062
02:07:23,399 --> 02:07:28,039
it's been proven to be a neuroprotectant

3063
02:07:25,279 --> 02:07:30,359
I've had six concussions in my life from

3064
02:07:28,039 --> 02:07:32,279
being a professional snowboarder from

3065
02:07:30,359 --> 02:07:34,279
being an athlete in my life six times

3066
02:07:32,279 --> 02:07:36,599
I've had concussions my brain shouldn't

3067
02:07:34,279 --> 02:07:39,238
be working the way that it does but

3068
02:07:36,599 --> 02:07:39,239
cannabis as a

3069
02:07:46,319 --> 02:07:52,000
neuro big money Grabbers you know huge

3070
02:07:49,800 --> 02:07:54,760
moneyers also the military

3071
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:57,920
the military we could be using CBD Rich

3072
02:07:54,760 --> 02:08:00,360
components right after a TBI a traumatic

3073
02:07:57,920 --> 02:08:02,719
brain injury for those who aren't aware

3074
02:08:00,359 --> 02:08:06,158
which is a huge component of the most

3075
02:08:02,719 --> 02:08:09,719
recent Wars is the uh large explosions

3076
02:08:06,158 --> 02:08:12,598
that cause immediate concussive and huge

3077
02:08:09,719 --> 02:08:15,800
uh injuries and costs overtime which if

3078
02:08:12,599 --> 02:08:17,360
they were given something CBD Rich right

3079
02:08:15,800 --> 02:08:18,960
out the gate like they would give some

3080
02:08:17,359 --> 02:08:21,639
of the other medications like I was

3081
02:08:18,960 --> 02:08:23,480
given morphine when I went down I mean

3082
02:08:21,639 --> 02:08:25,520
think you would see a significant change

3083
02:08:23,479 --> 02:08:28,039
and we want to see and so that's one of

3084
02:08:25,520 --> 02:08:30,000
the thresholds we're pushing for but

3085
02:08:28,039 --> 02:08:32,039
that's a different methodology which I

3086
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:36,399
think it may permeate through the

3087
02:08:32,039 --> 02:08:38,760
private Market of an NFL or a UFC before

3088
02:08:36,399 --> 02:08:40,879
unfortunately it will make that uh crack

3089
02:08:38,760 --> 02:08:42,239
hole through the veteran situation but

3090
02:08:40,880 --> 02:08:43,800
but it's happening and that's where it's

3091
02:08:42,238 --> 02:08:45,879
going to happen I think that that's

3092
02:08:43,800 --> 02:08:48,719
where because if you look at the NBA and

3093
02:08:45,880 --> 02:08:50,520
you look at there's a weird thing going

3094
02:08:48,719 --> 02:08:52,960
on where the NBA is very popular in

3095
02:08:50,520 --> 02:08:55,079
China very popular in Japan in those

3096
02:08:52,960 --> 02:08:58,039
places and you look at what Kobe BR or

3097
02:08:55,078 --> 02:08:59,399
what is it uh um you know the greatest

3098
02:08:58,039 --> 02:09:01,359
basketball player in the world got into

3099
02:08:59,399 --> 02:09:04,158
a weird situation when he was

3100
02:09:01,359 --> 02:09:06,359
criticizing some stuff the my point is

3101
02:09:04,158 --> 02:09:08,118
is that when you look at big Sports if

3102
02:09:06,359 --> 02:09:10,238
big Sports start to allow cannabis to

3103
02:09:08,118 --> 02:09:11,558
come in that's the acceptance level

3104
02:09:10,238 --> 02:09:13,638
that's the Breakthrough for the rest of

3105
02:09:11,559 --> 02:09:15,599
it because there's so much money behind

3106
02:09:13,639 --> 02:09:17,599
that end of it and that entertainment

3107
02:09:15,599 --> 02:09:19,119
value it's it's happening that's the

3108
02:09:17,599 --> 02:09:22,119
point is that we're seeing it and I

3109
02:09:19,118 --> 02:09:22,118
think

3110
02:09:30,920 --> 02:09:35,399
do well from it um and and that's my

3111
02:09:33,279 --> 02:09:38,198
biggest fear is that like you know when

3112
02:09:35,399 --> 02:09:40,279
Johnson and Johnson uh decides to

3113
02:09:38,198 --> 02:09:41,638
compete with us uh it becomes a

3114
02:09:40,279 --> 02:09:43,840
different story you know it'll be a

3115
02:09:41,639 --> 02:09:45,559
different thing but um you know hey if I

3116
02:09:43,840 --> 02:09:48,039
have to go live in the woods in in

3117
02:09:45,559 --> 02:09:49,960
[ __ ] Alaska or something somewhere so

3118
02:09:48,039 --> 02:09:51,920
I can grow and enjoy can or even a

3119
02:09:49,960 --> 02:09:53,480
better region and have gun and protect

3120
02:09:51,920 --> 02:09:55,279
myself I will I don't give a [ __ ] and I

3121
02:09:53,479 --> 02:09:57,000
think we have enough veterans in our

3122
02:09:55,279 --> 02:09:59,479
country that will nothing's going to

3123
02:09:57,000 --> 02:10:00,960
change in that way in a sense um I think

3124
02:09:59,479 --> 02:10:02,479
we're all you know heading in the right

3125
02:10:00,960 --> 02:10:04,319
direction but these are the signs like

3126
02:10:02,479 --> 02:10:07,158
the when I saw the UFC make that

3127
02:10:04,319 --> 02:10:09,519
decision and then I'm watching postf

3128
02:10:07,158 --> 02:10:13,158
fight conferences and [ __ ] Nate Diaz

3129
02:10:09,520 --> 02:10:16,320
is smoking joints on the stage I'm

3130
02:10:13,158 --> 02:10:20,399
like you have that golden hour once you

3131
02:10:16,319 --> 02:10:22,439
hit that that TPI to actually you know

3132
02:10:20,399 --> 02:10:25,799
stop as much Dam D AG as you possibly

3133
02:10:22,439 --> 02:10:29,000
can so it's really critical that you

3134
02:10:25,800 --> 02:10:33,279
know they find or start to create those

3135
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:36,479
specific types of uh uh uh point of

3136
02:10:33,279 --> 02:10:38,920
attack mechanisms specifically with

3137
02:10:36,479 --> 02:10:41,598
cannaboids um and I think that's a new

3138
02:10:38,920 --> 02:10:44,078
frontier I mean I'm saying it's most

3139
02:10:41,599 --> 02:10:46,400
likely through the private scenario but

3140
02:10:44,078 --> 02:10:49,759
I mean the VA is the largest you know

3141
02:10:46,399 --> 02:10:52,039
medical system in the world currently so

3142
02:10:49,760 --> 02:10:54,159
and you know government does hold a

3143
02:10:52,039 --> 02:10:56,719
patent you know so at the same time

3144
02:10:54,158 --> 02:10:58,799
there's a lot of big things at play here

3145
02:10:56,719 --> 02:11:01,960
and uh you know let's not forget we

3146
02:10:58,800 --> 02:11:04,599
still got a lot of work to do and also

3147
02:11:01,960 --> 02:11:06,559
you know one of the Forbidden cures in a

3148
02:11:04,599 --> 02:11:08,599
in being healthy is the medicinal

3149
02:11:06,559 --> 02:11:10,119
mushrooms you know and it it gets talked

3150
02:11:08,599 --> 02:11:11,840
about and then you gets forgotten about

3151
02:11:10,118 --> 02:11:14,158
and then talked and forgotten and then

3152
02:11:11,840 --> 02:11:16,920
you start realizing you know wow when

3153
02:11:14,158 --> 02:11:18,679
you put the two I mean Corps for one was

3154
02:11:16,920 --> 02:11:21,359
one of the russan I think it was the

3155
02:11:18,679 --> 02:11:22,760
Russian wrestling team or something or

3156
02:11:21,359 --> 02:11:24,519
the weightlifting team that couldn't be

3157
02:11:22,760 --> 02:11:26,800
beaten through the 80s and one of their

3158
02:11:24,520 --> 02:11:30,480
big things was you know taking Corps and

3159
02:11:26,800 --> 02:11:33,719
and chaga as a as a daily nutritional

3160
02:11:30,479 --> 02:11:33,718
supplement and

3161
02:11:35,078 --> 02:11:42,639
now Mar has put up our micro canic caps

3162
02:11:39,078 --> 02:11:44,000
and and putting their polyes are for the

3163
02:11:42,639 --> 02:11:46,000
most part you know of course there's

3164
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:48,920
tons of people that understand but the

3165
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:50,559
poly medicine is not written about it's

3166
02:11:48,920 --> 02:11:54,960
not a thing that's studied and we're

3167
02:11:50,559 --> 02:11:58,279
here getting ready for for

3168
02:11:54,960 --> 02:12:00,319
yeah a lockdown you know and we have

3169
02:11:58,279 --> 02:12:02,599
this magical

3170
02:12:00,319 --> 02:12:04,599
medicinal compounds in the forest which

3171
02:12:02,599 --> 02:12:05,800
they want to fire smart and get rid of

3172
02:12:04,599 --> 02:12:07,559
all the branches and get rid of the

3173
02:12:05,800 --> 02:12:09,599
polypores I feel like I'm I don't know

3174
02:12:07,559 --> 02:12:10,880
what world I live in right now and I

3175
02:12:09,599 --> 02:12:12,960
think that it's really important you

3176
02:12:10,880 --> 02:12:15,480
know as we're talking about isolating

3177
02:12:12,960 --> 02:12:17,198
cannabis we also need to recognize that

3178
02:12:15,479 --> 02:12:18,718
if we're going to be isolating a lot of

3179
02:12:17,198 --> 02:12:21,238
things we could be getting into

3180
02:12:18,719 --> 02:12:23,880
detriment so I hear a lot about like

3181
02:12:21,238 --> 02:12:25,759
like isolating you know parts of the

3182
02:12:23,880 --> 02:12:27,520
industry and what what the federal

3183
02:12:25,760 --> 02:12:30,039
government is going to start wanting us

3184
02:12:27,520 --> 02:12:31,960
to do is not talking to each other is

3185
02:12:30,039 --> 02:12:33,760
that the distributor is not talking to

3186
02:12:31,960 --> 02:12:36,000
the to the grower and that the grower is

3187
02:12:33,760 --> 02:12:37,920
not talking to the breeder but our

3188
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:40,238
success in our industry has been

3189
02:12:37,920 --> 02:12:42,199
holistic in a manner the reason why

3190
02:12:40,238 --> 02:12:43,598
we've been so successful and the reason

3191
02:12:42,198 --> 02:12:45,678
why we still have our health and

3192
02:12:43,599 --> 02:12:48,400
well-being and we're still having

3193
02:12:45,679 --> 02:12:50,039
beautiful relationships with this plant

3194
02:12:48,399 --> 02:12:52,118
is because we've looked at all

3195
02:12:50,039 --> 02:12:54,840
attributes of it you know Addison what

3196
02:12:52,118 --> 02:12:58,519
you were saying before is that you know

3197
02:12:54,840 --> 02:13:00,360
um a grower before had to have the

3198
02:12:58,520 --> 02:13:02,599
knowing of what was going on with their

3199
02:13:00,359 --> 02:13:04,519
distributor they had to know what was

3200
02:13:02,599 --> 02:13:05,840
going on and now it's like Yay you know

3201
02:13:04,520 --> 02:13:07,960
it's going out the door it doesn't

3202
02:13:05,840 --> 02:13:10,800
matter where it goes you don't even have

3203
02:13:07,960 --> 02:13:14,520
to look at it and it creates sort of

3204
02:13:10,800 --> 02:13:16,880
this isolating feeling and a disconnect

3205
02:13:14,520 --> 02:13:19,239
that is not going to help out the Legacy

3206
02:13:16,880 --> 02:13:23,000
Growers or the Legacy breeders or the

3207
02:13:19,238 --> 02:13:25,279
Legacy uh you know extractors or even

3208
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:27,920
the canabo or the health and well-being

3209
02:13:25,279 --> 02:13:30,479
or the message of the plant if we don't

3210
02:13:27,920 --> 02:13:34,039
always have full access and full

3211
02:13:30,479 --> 02:13:37,638
communication with all parts of this you

3212
02:13:34,039 --> 02:13:39,198
know uh uh industry and and

3213
02:13:37,639 --> 02:13:41,480
unfortunately right now I call it an

3214
02:13:39,198 --> 02:13:43,479
outdry because I feel like we could do

3215
02:13:41,479 --> 02:13:46,198
so much better but these conversations

3216
02:13:43,479 --> 02:13:48,759
are really helping people say oh you

3217
02:13:46,198 --> 02:13:50,158
know on that and oh that's really

3218
02:13:48,760 --> 02:13:52,960
interesting that's something that's been

3219
02:13:50,158 --> 02:13:55,679
uncovered by today or or has been

3220
02:13:52,960 --> 02:13:57,960
uncovered you know consistently by Mark

3221
02:13:55,679 --> 02:14:00,880
and so you know continuing to uncover

3222
02:13:57,960 --> 02:14:02,399
the veils of separatism that they want

3223
02:14:00,880 --> 02:14:04,599
to put us into these different

3224
02:14:02,399 --> 02:14:07,238
compartments is going to be the death of

3225
02:14:04,599 --> 02:14:08,679
the industry competition with each other

3226
02:14:07,238 --> 02:14:10,959
is going to be the deaths of the

3227
02:14:08,679 --> 02:14:13,639
industry so we have to know what's going

3228
02:14:10,960 --> 02:14:15,599
on and bring each other up with the good

3229
02:14:13,639 --> 02:14:17,039
practices that are happening of course

3230
02:14:15,599 --> 02:14:19,920
surrounding health and

3231
02:14:17,039 --> 02:14:21,760
well-being and um I just did I just had

we've had since Frenchie's passing it

3249
02:15:07,399 --> 02:15:12,158
would be rough it would be rough for us

3250
02:15:08,960 --> 02:15:14,800
to not mention uh Frenchie canoli a true

3251
02:15:12,158 --> 02:15:17,039
hash afficionado and and lover of hash

3252
02:15:14,800 --> 02:15:18,840
and you know I I've known Frenchie for

3253
02:15:17,039 --> 02:15:21,078
quite a few years and bumped into him

3254
02:15:18,840 --> 02:15:22,639
many times and he's been on hash Church

3255
02:15:21,078 --> 02:15:24,639
we kind of saw things a little

3256
02:15:22,639 --> 02:15:27,000
differently but we're always able to get

3257
02:15:24,639 --> 02:15:30,000
together through our love of hashish and

3258
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:32,000
it was just nice to see everyone talk so

3259
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:34,599
nice about him and you know all the

3260
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:36,279
pictures that circulated about of him I

3261
02:15:34,599 --> 02:15:37,840
realized I don't even think I have a

3262
02:15:36,279 --> 02:15:40,399
picture where Frenchie wasn't just like

3263

on his face like bigest smile and then

3265

3266
02:15:44,840 --> 02:15:49,119
with Frenchie because uh I am French and

3267
02:15:47,198 --> 02:15:50,759

3268
02:15:49,118 --> 02:15:52,920
I always had that going with Frenchie

3269
02:15:50,760 --> 02:15:55,520

3270

in this movement and there's very

3278
02:16:21,359 --> 02:16:25,558

3279

me smile made me laugh always had the

3280
02:16:25,559 --> 02:16:29,800
most [ __ ] eating grin on his face and as

3281
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:32,439
much of his love for cannabis he had a

3282
02:16:29,800 --> 02:16:35,599
love for chocolate so he and I would

3283
02:16:32,439 --> 02:16:38,760
speak and love chocolate and uh you know

3284
02:16:35,599 --> 02:16:40,719
I got to uh ask him my 200 cannabis

3285
02:16:38,760 --> 02:16:43,359
questions of which a lot of you I'd love

3286
02:16:40,718 --> 02:16:46,959
to get on at some point and also love to

3287
02:16:43,359 --> 02:16:48,719
get you on our vac round tables but um

3288
02:16:46,959 --> 02:16:51,000
you know I got to ask him 200 questions

3289
02:16:48,718 --> 02:16:53,879
about cannabis and just they're all

3290
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:57,159
specific and it was just such a fun time

3291
02:16:53,879 --> 02:16:58,438
and we were went over to get high and we

3292
02:16:57,159 --> 02:17:00,359
just got so engrossed in the

3293
02:16:58,439 --> 02:17:03,079
conversation and his wife was recording

3294
02:17:00,359 --> 02:17:05,359
us so it was very small and intimate and

3295
02:17:03,079 --> 02:17:08,200
very fun and it wasn't until I was like

3296
02:17:05,359 --> 02:17:10,000
on 150th question that we're like we

3297
02:17:08,200 --> 02:17:12,159
should probably get high I think we

3298
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:14,879
forgot to get high and you know we Sheed

3299
02:17:12,159 --> 02:17:17,239
up and you know we finally arrived there

3300
02:17:14,879 --> 02:17:21,398
but you know from the first time he came

3301
02:17:17,239 --> 02:17:22,840
and met me which is over a decade ago uh

3302
02:17:21,398 --> 02:17:25,718
I was one of the first people we came in

3303
02:17:22,840 --> 02:17:28,280
the bay and talked to and he was you

3304
02:17:25,718 --> 02:17:31,079
know because of you know the the know of

3305
02:17:28,280 --> 02:17:33,399
BPG and I looked at his hash and said

3306
02:17:31,079 --> 02:17:36,359
we're not ready for this the industry is

3307
02:17:33,398 --> 02:17:38,558
not ready for this we can't afford this

3308
02:17:36,359 --> 02:17:40,719
uh compared to the realities of what we

3309
02:17:38,558 --> 02:17:43,558
were seeing at the time and I just kind

3310
02:17:40,718 --> 02:17:46,039
of gave him the honest lay of the land

3311
02:17:43,558 --> 02:17:47,718
and I told him his hash was great and he

3312
02:17:46,040 --> 02:17:49,920
always appreciated that he's like I

3313
02:17:47,718 --> 02:17:52,598
always appreciated your honesty you know

3314
02:17:49,920 --> 02:17:55,478
we've all tried the Frenchy accent you

3315
02:17:52,599 --> 02:17:59,880
know it is so thick it is so French it

3316
02:17:55,478 --> 02:18:01,718
is so so amazing and I uh every time I

3317
02:17:59,879 --> 02:18:05,159
even you know I'm from Louisiana I'm

3318
02:18:01,718 --> 02:18:08,000
cinjun and I had a hard time hearing him

3319
02:18:05,159 --> 02:18:09,760
and his French depending was I mean I

3320
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:12,478
don't know about you I speak French too

3321
02:18:09,760 --> 02:18:15,079
but it was definitely Sometimes some

3322
02:18:12,478 --> 02:18:18,119
words depending on how they were stated

3323
02:18:15,079 --> 02:18:19,359
you were like what the [ __ ] was that try

3324
02:18:18,120 --> 02:18:22,000
that in another way yeah it was

3325
02:18:19,359 --> 02:18:25,159
certainly not it was certainly not KCA

3326
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:30,200
French it was very very f

3327
02:18:25,159 --> 02:18:32,638
f but his stories and especially to hear

3328
02:18:30,200 --> 02:18:35,719
over the years all the different his

3329
02:18:32,638 --> 02:18:38,759
travels were amazing I mean there the

3330
02:18:35,718 --> 02:18:40,598
incredible risks that he took I don't

3331
02:18:38,760 --> 02:18:42,519
think an American couldn't could have

3332
02:18:40,599 --> 02:18:46,719
gotten away with some of the [ __ ] that

3333
02:18:42,519 --> 02:18:50,200
he did it's definitely had agree but uh

3334
02:18:46,718 --> 02:18:55,000
he was just an amazing spirit and I was

3335
02:18:50,200 --> 02:18:57,760
just I I it's it hurt to lose him um it

3336
02:18:55,000 --> 02:19:00,760
still hurts I will miss him I will miss

3337
02:18:57,760 --> 02:19:04,000
him especially when I see him at the um

3338
02:19:00,760 --> 02:19:06,000
when I don't see him at the emerald cup

3339

3340
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:12,359

02:19:29,200 --> 02:19:33,679
on about what the name was going to be

3349
02:19:31,439 --> 02:19:36,120
and so we're just launching the new

3350
02:19:33,679 --> 02:19:39,519
strain called Frenchie

3351
02:19:36,120 --> 02:19:43,639
Force why it's called Frenchie's force

3352
02:19:39,519 --> 02:19:46,439
is because he was such a force such an

3353
02:19:43,638 --> 02:19:48,759
incredible force of tenacity and what I

3354
02:19:46,439 --> 02:19:50,840
had said and we were also so incredibly

3355
02:19:48,760 --> 02:19:52,920
honored thank you so much Kimberly for

3356

3357
02:19:52,920 --> 02:19:59,639
at his uh at his memorial and I just

3358
02:19:56,359 --> 02:20:02,920
feel like tenacity was it man when he

3359
02:19:59,639 --> 02:20:05,680
was coming up to you and he was coming

3360

3363
02:20:10,760 --> 02:20:14,359
because he's coming for you and he's

3364
02:20:12,478 --> 02:20:16,679
gonna be talking about what you know

3365
02:20:14,359 --> 02:20:18,600
you're up to what we need to do in the

3366
02:20:16,680 --> 02:20:20,159
future all the 10 billion things that

3367
02:20:18,600 --> 02:20:22,318
need to be checked off the list to get

3368
02:20:20,159 --> 02:20:24,879
the farmer was up there to make sure

3369
02:20:22,318 --> 02:20:26,398
that the industry was still working to

3370
02:20:24,879 --> 02:20:31,199
where it was Community built and

3371
02:20:26,398 --> 02:20:31,199
Community monitored and Community run I

3372
02:20:45,959 --> 02:20:52,839
just and if you could and if you can die

3373
02:20:49,920 --> 02:20:55,719
with all of that work seriously being

3374
02:20:52,840 --> 02:20:57,920
put out to the universal flow and it

3375
02:20:55,719 --> 02:21:00,279
being circulated to where it's actually

3376
02:20:57,920 --> 02:21:02,960
regenerative and it's growing new ideas

3377
02:21:00,280 --> 02:21:06,200
and new Bounty and and it's creating all

3378
02:21:02,959 --> 02:21:09,119
of this health and wealth and knowledge

3379
02:21:06,200 --> 02:21:11,920
um for all of us I just you know that's

3380
02:21:09,120 --> 02:21:14,600
all that we can ever ask for so you know

3381
02:21:11,920 --> 02:21:17,280
if you only got One Life to Live [ __ ]

3382
02:21:14,600 --> 02:21:19,239
live it like Frenchie because he just

3383
02:21:17,280 --> 02:21:21,560
really took every single day and it's

3384
02:21:19,239 --> 02:21:24,318
not surprising to me

3385
02:21:21,559 --> 02:21:26,760
you know maybe he did die too young

3386
02:21:24,318 --> 02:21:29,398
because every single day was like three

3387
02:21:26,760 --> 02:21:33,079
days every single day maybe it was like

3388
02:21:29,398 --> 02:21:35,519
six days you know the brother was G and

3389
02:21:33,079 --> 02:21:37,520
he also really brought home you know

3390
02:21:35,520 --> 02:21:39,840
that connection to the farmer and the

3391
02:21:37,520 --> 02:21:41,680
resin you know and he always said from

3392
02:21:39,840 --> 02:21:44,680
the beginning you know I cannot do any

3393
02:21:41,680 --> 02:21:45,920
of this without the farmer and also

3394
02:21:44,680 --> 02:21:48,800
bringing

3395
02:21:45,920 --> 02:21:51,520
in and bringing in the Appalachia and

3396
02:21:48,799 --> 02:21:55,398
terroir and that whole flavor pallet you

3397
02:21:51,520 --> 02:21:57,960
know that whole like true connoisseur

3398
02:21:55,398 --> 02:21:59,840
you know way of connecting with the

3399
02:21:57,959 --> 02:22:02,159
plant and the resin and and you know we

3400
02:21:59,840 --> 02:22:04,719
were really blessed because he really

3401
02:22:02,159 --> 02:22:06,359
took on the pure the pure certification

3402
02:22:04,719 --> 02:22:08,920
and the farmers and really recognized

3403
02:22:06,359 --> 02:22:11,479
you know how how having a connection

3404
02:22:08,920 --> 02:22:14,159
with them was like he came to our Hive

3405
02:22:11,478 --> 02:22:15,639
gathering at Hartwood um a couple years

3406
02:22:14,159 --> 02:22:19,039
ago and he was like I thought I was

3407
02:22:15,639 --> 02:22:21,398
coming here for you here to just make it

3408
02:22:19,040 --> 02:22:23,479
awesome and be Frenchy and then after

3409
02:22:21,398 --> 02:22:25,599
the weekend at The Hive Gathering he was

3410
02:22:23,478 --> 02:22:29,920
just like oh my God I did this this was

3411
02:22:25,600 --> 02:22:32,040
for me he just felt so full in his heart

3412
02:22:29,920 --> 02:22:35,359
and it wasn't an industry thing it was a

3413
02:22:32,040 --> 02:22:38,479
heart thing like you're talking about we

3414
02:22:35,359 --> 02:22:40,200
aru it wasn't a thing of you know

3415
02:22:38,478 --> 02:22:43,199
content and

3416
02:22:40,200 --> 02:22:46,200
stuff and then also at the regenerative

3417
02:22:43,200 --> 02:22:48,000
cannabis uh you know events that we did

3418
02:22:46,200 --> 02:22:49,840
we had some also some really beautiful

3419
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:53,280
conversations with him and he was always

3420
02:22:49,840 --> 02:22:55,719
ready to rock the boat and and in that

3421
02:22:53,280 --> 02:22:57,920
and and in that I want to say somehow

3422
02:22:55,719 --> 02:22:59,679
there was still heart and soul and there

3423
02:22:57,920 --> 02:23:02,200
was still room

3424
02:22:59,680 --> 02:23:03,639
for uh being wrong yeah being wrong

3425
02:23:02,200 --> 02:23:06,159
trying to find the right way out and

3426
02:23:03,639 --> 02:23:09,879
even and even in his way of being like

3427
02:23:06,159 --> 02:23:12,200
so steadfast on his path he even evolved

3428
02:23:09,879 --> 02:23:14,559
and started using freeze dryers and

3429
02:23:12,200 --> 02:23:15,880
started using you know mechanical

3430
02:23:14,559 --> 02:23:18,680
separators and all these different

3431
02:23:15,879 --> 02:23:21,239
things so and even recognizing rosin so

3432
02:23:18,680 --> 02:23:23,398
you know huge love to fr you know for

3433
02:23:21,239 --> 02:23:25,159
upholding the Ruth but also evolving

3434
02:23:23,398 --> 02:23:25,879
with the community he was a true legend

3435
02:23:25,159 --> 02:23:28,920
of

3436
02:23:25,879 --> 02:23:32,159
hashish he was a passionate disruptor

3437
02:23:28,920 --> 02:23:34,799
for sure like he had such like I

3438
02:23:32,159 --> 02:23:37,559
remember my my my memories of him are

3439
02:23:34,799 --> 02:23:39,759
more Visual and like he would always

3440
02:23:37,559 --> 02:23:41,840
he'd have like a something rolled up and

3441
02:23:39,760 --> 02:23:43,559
he'd kind of be leaning in he'd always

3442
02:23:41,840 --> 02:23:46,120
be close to you because he always wanted

3443
02:23:43,559 --> 02:23:48,079
to communicate like and it was just like

3444
02:23:46,120 --> 02:23:50,680
anytime I ever saw him I didn't know him

3445
02:23:48,079 --> 02:23:52,879
very well but we knew each other but

3446
02:23:50,680 --> 02:23:55,439
anytime I ever saw him he always like

3447
02:23:52,879 --> 02:23:58,000
came to you give you a hug and then

3448
02:23:55,439 --> 02:24:01,279
you'd see him like float away and do the

3449
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:04,159
same thing to every booth in the place

3450
02:24:01,279 --> 02:24:05,920
with every and like he just shared space

3451
02:24:04,159 --> 02:24:07,600
even to like I'd be at the High Times

3452
02:24:05,920 --> 02:24:10,359
company it would be like let's see

3453
02:24:07,600 --> 02:24:10,359
Frenchie

3454
02:24:15,200 --> 02:24:20,840
or you know like La gangster grow dudes

3455
02:24:18,760 --> 02:24:22,439
and [ __ ] and he'd be like ah see those

3456
02:24:20,840 --> 02:24:24,120
dudes and then I'd see him went to the

3457
02:24:22,439 --> 02:24:27,520
next booth and it was just such a person

3458
02:24:24,120 --> 02:24:30,960
that that I mean p his passion was tough

3459
02:24:27,520 --> 02:24:33,760
to to to beat because he the but also

3460
02:24:30,959 --> 02:24:35,759
just when it comes to leaving a legacy

3461
02:24:33,760 --> 02:24:38,840
every hash maker that I talk to now

3462
02:24:35,760 --> 02:24:40,239
that's whether it's a tryhard a guy

3463
02:24:38,840 --> 02:24:41,960
who's just kind of getting into it and

3464
02:24:40,239 --> 02:24:44,559
figuring it out or like a legendary

3465
02:24:41,959 --> 02:24:47,559
person that they always um when it comes

3466
02:24:44,559 --> 02:24:49,278
to to you know they know who Frenchie is

3467
02:24:47,559 --> 02:24:51,398
and and they and they all know about

3468
02:24:49,279 --> 02:24:53,479
Temple balls and the reason is because

3469
02:24:51,398 --> 02:24:56,719
he was such an educator like the dude

3470
02:24:53,478 --> 02:24:59,119
was always teaching people all the time

3471
02:24:56,719 --> 02:25:01,559
and and and he would argue with you you

3472
02:24:59,120 --> 02:25:04,240
know M me mine and his argument was that

3473
02:25:01,559 --> 02:25:07,719
like I call everything that's a

3474
02:25:04,239 --> 02:25:09,318
concentrate hash I'm like that's hash

3475
02:25:07,719 --> 02:25:11,318
like they even have a food that's kind

3476
02:25:09,318 --> 02:25:12,879
of named after it because it's a mix of

3477
02:25:11,318 --> 02:25:14,840
things like and we would have this great

3478
02:25:12,879 --> 02:25:18,039
argument of stuff but like he's just

3479
02:25:14,840 --> 02:25:19,960
such such a beautiful person and to to

3480
02:25:18,040 --> 02:25:22,200
finish off we're going to be doing a

3481
02:25:19,959 --> 02:25:25,438

3482

subcool who is definitely kind of how I

3514
02:26:49,120 --> 02:26:54,279
heard about first Matt rise and then

3515
02:26:51,639 --> 02:26:56,039
eventually sub cool and bity dank just

3516
02:26:54,279 --> 02:26:57,560
had written this in the chat room I

3517
02:26:56,040 --> 02:27:00,279
hadn't heard of Frenchie until he hooked

3518
02:26:57,559 --> 02:27:02,559
up with subcool and cannabis afficionado

3519
02:27:00,279 --> 02:27:05,560
and did the hunters of the Dank with

3520
02:27:02,559 --> 02:27:07,199
TC so yeah that was kind of how I heard

3521
02:27:05,559 --> 02:27:09,519
about Frenchy for the first time was

3522
02:27:07,200 --> 02:27:12,640
through subol who I had known like

3523
02:27:09,520 --> 02:27:14,439
really since like gez I don't know Colin

3524
02:27:12,639 --> 02:27:16,079
when were we on those chats was that

3525
02:27:14,439 --> 02:27:18,279
like in the like

3526
02:27:16,079 --> 02:27:22,398
90 n or

3527
02:27:18,279 --> 02:27:24,560
something yeah I mean like up

3528
02:27:22,398 --> 02:27:27,318
remember can you hear

3529
02:27:24,559 --> 02:27:29,519
me yeah yeah yeah it was true Stoners

3530
02:27:27,318 --> 02:27:31,398
right yeah like true Stoners and then

3531
02:27:29,520 --> 02:27:33,760
also Laughing Moon and then Laughing

3532
02:27:31,398 --> 02:27:37,358
Moon eventually became

3533
02:27:33,760 --> 02:27:39,760
overgrow and you know so on and so forth

3534
02:27:37,359 --> 02:27:42,640
right but yeah I

3535
02:27:39,760 --> 02:27:45,359
mean he was like one of the first guys

3536
02:27:42,639 --> 02:27:47,039
that I think as a breeder that was

3537
02:27:45,359 --> 02:27:50,279
working with different varieties I mean

3538
02:27:47,040 --> 02:27:51,760
all of his stuff was like just I mean

3539
02:27:50,279 --> 02:27:54,079
not all of it yielded well but it was

3540
02:27:51,760 --> 02:27:56,478
like the resin was incredible you know

3541
02:27:54,079 --> 02:27:58,600
like all of the resin was just like

3542
02:27:56,478 --> 02:28:01,199
always really

3543
02:27:58,600 --> 02:28:03,479
topnotch I know it's one of the things I

3544
02:28:01,200 --> 02:28:05,479
always had to give up to sub and why I

3545
02:28:03,478 --> 02:28:07,478
always had a good relationship with sub

3546
02:28:05,478 --> 02:28:09,599
even as he was kind of having his own

3547
02:28:07,478 --> 02:28:11,760
internet dramas and all there was always

3548
02:28:09,600 --> 02:28:13,040
people like oh [ __ ] I'm some cool and I

3549
02:28:11,760 --> 02:28:14,279
was like I don't know man I you know I

3550
02:28:13,040 --> 02:28:15,560
don't have a relationship with them

3551
02:28:14,279 --> 02:28:17,439
other than the fact when I get together

3552
02:28:15,559 --> 02:28:20,119
with because resident killer and every

3553
02:28:17,439 --> 02:28:23,600
time I run [ __ ] no matter who Brew it

3554
02:28:20,120 --> 02:28:25,120
it's also killer Super Sub subcool was

3555
02:28:23,600 --> 02:28:28,359
one of the first ones to sell

3556
02:28:25,120 --> 02:28:31,079
dispensaries seeds too in the early days

3557
02:28:28,359 --> 02:28:33,399
you know he was the fir one of the first

3558
02:28:31,079 --> 02:28:35,600
because earlier on it was clones I know

3559
02:28:33,398 --> 02:28:37,959
because I worked for Ed I was Ed's

3560
02:28:35,600 --> 02:28:41,439
general manager I was pushing out 5,000

3561
02:28:37,959 --> 02:28:44,358
clones a week in the Bay Area so there

3562
02:28:41,439 --> 02:28:46,760
were no seed and it wasn't until I was

3563
02:28:44,359 --> 02:28:49,239
then finally working at BPG that you

3564
02:28:46,760 --> 02:28:51,398
know uh people like him actually would

3565
02:28:49,239 --> 02:28:53,520
come in and actually have seeds or take

3566
02:28:51,398 --> 02:28:55,719
the chance to come in and actually have

3567
02:28:53,520 --> 02:28:58,279
seeds available so that people could

3568
02:28:55,719 --> 02:29:00,239
grow something besides the standard

3569
02:28:58,279 --> 02:29:02,640
genetics that we had and as you people

3570
02:29:00,239 --> 02:29:05,239
were talking early about Cali orange we

3571
02:29:02,639 --> 02:29:09,599
were the main peret perpetrators of that

3572
02:29:05,239 --> 02:29:14,159
genetic in the Bay Area for years so you

3573
02:29:09,600 --> 02:29:16,600
know get up but subcool was the one of

3574
02:29:14,159 --> 02:29:20,318
the early ogs for us here in the

3575
02:29:16,600 --> 02:29:22,479
California Dispensary scene to get see

3576
02:29:20,318 --> 02:29:25,559
genetics out there because none of the

3577
02:29:22,478 --> 02:29:28,519
Europe EU seeders were you know playing

3578
02:29:25,559 --> 02:29:30,840
in America or trying to until you know

3579
02:29:28,520 --> 02:29:33,600
decades later you know it was subcool

3580
02:29:30,840 --> 02:29:35,318
and it was bog those were the the two

3581
02:29:33,600 --> 02:29:36,359
that I remember you could get in like

3582
02:29:35,318 --> 02:29:38,519
the

3583
02:29:36,359 --> 02:29:41,399
dispensaries and and funny enough those

3584
02:29:38,520 --> 02:29:43,840
were two of my first like customers it

3585
02:29:41,398 --> 02:29:45,959
was actually highgrade who was from

3586
02:29:43,840 --> 02:29:48,799
overgrow and he did these bubbler

3587
02:29:45,959 --> 02:29:50,318
buckets he was like like if you were on

3588
02:29:48,799 --> 02:29:51,920
those sites back then you knew knew who

3589
02:29:50,318 --> 02:29:54,879
highgrade was and in fact he was my

3590
02:29:51,920 --> 02:29:56,600
first customer and and afterwards I

3591
02:29:54,879 --> 02:29:59,239
think about a year into it he ended up

3592
02:29:56,600 --> 02:30:01,520
getting busted and going to jail and I

3593
02:29:59,239 --> 02:30:03,559
kept I would like send him magazines and

3594
02:30:01,520 --> 02:30:06,159
commissary money and stuff to kind of

3595
02:30:03,559 --> 02:30:08,159
keep them going but then you had subcool

3596
02:30:06,159 --> 02:30:10,799
you had bog you had all these guys that

3597
02:30:08,159 --> 02:30:12,600
were growing the Dank strains and the

3598
02:30:10,799 --> 02:30:14,799
way I was selling it to them was I was

3599
02:30:12,600 --> 02:30:16,720
like listen everyone thinks their shit's

3600
02:30:14,799 --> 02:30:19,000
the best but these bags are going to be

3601
02:30:16,719 --> 02:30:20,679
like the word of God even if you don't

3602
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:22,559
believe in God they'll be the word of

3603
02:30:20,680 --> 02:30:24,720
whatever you do believe in because when

3604
02:30:22,559 --> 02:30:26,799
you run your material through these bags

3605
02:30:24,719 --> 02:30:29,519
your resin will not be able to hide from

3606
02:30:26,799 --> 02:30:32,840
you once you've unveiled it from

3607
02:30:29,520 --> 02:30:35,359
everything else that was present and uh

3608
02:30:32,840 --> 02:30:38,520
subcool and you know I was talking to

3609
02:30:35,359 --> 02:30:40,520
this uh about this with Addison today

3610
02:30:38,520 --> 02:30:42,279
when you know I first started doing this

3611
02:30:40,520 --> 02:30:44,319
I caught Sam's attention because not

3612
02:30:42,279 --> 02:30:46,200
many people were doing what I was doing

3613
02:30:44,318 --> 02:30:48,239
you know then when Matt rise came out

3614
02:30:46,200 --> 02:30:50,159
and then eventually Nick they caught my

3615
02:30:48,239 --> 02:30:52,000
attention I was like oh what are these

3616
02:30:50,159 --> 02:30:53,559
guys doing what I've learned over the

3617
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:56,000
years from all of these unique

3618
02:30:53,559 --> 02:30:59,039
characters sure yeah we might be able to

3619
02:30:56,000 --> 02:31:01,680
follow clean Sops and have Chef likee

3620
02:30:59,040 --> 02:31:04,960
standards but really what we have is an

3621
02:31:01,680 --> 02:31:08,200
old factory that allows us to track down

3622
02:31:04,959 --> 02:31:10,039
incredible breeders and Growers and

3623
02:31:08,200 --> 02:31:11,600
suddenly when you're running material

3624
02:31:10,040 --> 02:31:13,640
like that because I remember the first

3625
02:31:11,600 --> 02:31:16,559
four five six times I

3626
02:31:13,639 --> 02:31:18,680
ran material through bags it was

3627
02:31:16,559 --> 02:31:21,239
terrible and it wasn't until breeder

3628
02:31:18,680 --> 02:31:23,920
Steve was like I got some uh shisha

3629
02:31:21,239 --> 02:31:26,559
Berry the yellow line I was like o the

3630
02:31:23,920 --> 02:31:28,680
yellow line that was my favorite line of

3631
02:31:26,559 --> 02:31:31,278
the red and the yellow afan that were

3632
02:31:28,680 --> 02:31:33,200
used to produce the two phenos of

3633
02:31:31,279 --> 02:31:36,279
shishka

3634
02:31:33,200 --> 02:31:39,120
berry anyway the first time I ran that

3635
02:31:36,279 --> 02:31:41,359
and actually saw full melt and prior to

3636
02:31:39,120 --> 02:31:43,880
that I had only ever seen full melt in

3637
02:31:41,359 --> 02:31:45,800
like Sam's bong when Rob puffed me down

3638
02:31:43,879 --> 02:31:47,119
in this Thai restaurant in Amsterdam and

3639
02:31:45,799 --> 02:31:49,199
said if it don't bubble it ain't worth

3640
02:31:47,120 --> 02:31:51,040
the trouble and I watched it all boiling

3641
02:31:49,200 --> 02:31:52,800
and bubbling I was like oh my God I have

3642
02:31:51,040 --> 02:31:56,840
to find that it took

3643
02:31:52,799 --> 02:31:59,920
me it took me almost four years to find

3644
02:31:56,840 --> 02:32:02,239
that because I saw it in 95 and then I

3645
02:31:59,920 --> 02:32:05,600
didn't have it myself till around like

3646
02:32:02,239 --> 02:32:09,239
the end of 98 the start of 99 which is

3647
02:32:05,600 --> 02:32:10,079
when fresh Hades and Bubble Bags was uh

3648
02:32:09,239 --> 02:32:13,439
was

3649
02:32:10,079 --> 02:32:15,359
founded you know I gotta I gotta come in

3650
02:32:13,439 --> 02:32:16,960
and and put in a beautiful word because

3651
02:32:15,359 --> 02:32:19,399
we were talking so much about Frenchie

3652
02:32:16,959 --> 02:32:22,119
and then came on with sub you know talk

3653
02:32:19,398 --> 02:32:24,719
about someone who was out there

3654
02:32:22,120 --> 02:32:27,200
incredibly passionate also about the

3655
02:32:24,719 --> 02:32:29,879
soil and not something I say very often

3656
02:32:27,200 --> 02:32:32,840
but he didn't give a [ __ ] and I really

3657
02:32:29,879 --> 02:32:35,079
appreciated that about him because that

3658
02:32:32,840 --> 02:32:37,639
was sort of the energy that needed to

3659
02:32:35,079 --> 02:32:39,639
push forward for the genetics to be able

3660
02:32:37,639 --> 02:32:42,559
to get out there for the information to

3661
02:32:39,639 --> 02:32:45,239
get out there and he came up with his uh

3662
02:32:42,559 --> 02:32:48,199
you know subsoil recipe which was

3663
02:32:45,239 --> 02:32:52,318
organic he did start to bring the term

3664
02:32:48,200 --> 02:32:53,680
organic to to the World flavor and as

3665
02:32:52,318 --> 02:32:57,239
much you

3666
02:32:53,680 --> 02:32:59,639
know I became and the Rev a little bit

3667
02:32:57,239 --> 02:33:02,199
yeah you know we always say that people

3668
02:32:59,639 --> 02:33:03,559
can't change or that you know we we

3669
02:33:02,200 --> 02:33:05,640
stick with something and we may stay

3670
02:33:03,559 --> 02:33:08,318
with it our whole lives I I became

3671
02:33:05,639 --> 02:33:13,799
really close to sub um after his house

3672
02:33:08,318 --> 02:33:13,799
burned down and the heart and

3673
02:33:15,318 --> 02:33:22,359
soul that he came

3674
02:33:18,359 --> 02:33:25,760
to um in his life was just astounding

3675
02:33:22,359 --> 02:33:28,680
and I just had so much love for the life

3676
02:33:25,760 --> 02:33:30,318
that he lived you know um big up to miss

3677
02:33:28,680 --> 02:33:32,960
Jill because we're talking a lot about

3678
02:33:30,318 --> 02:33:35,799
his genetics but she was a big part of

3679
02:33:32,959 --> 02:33:38,799
that as well and you know just just so

3680
02:33:35,799 --> 02:33:41,358
much love for for being human and and

3681
02:33:38,799 --> 02:33:42,799
ending with with heart and soul so you

3682
02:33:41,359 --> 02:33:45,120
know Big Ups

3683
02:33:42,799 --> 02:33:47,398
to now he had a great impact he

3684
02:33:45,120 --> 02:33:48,720
definitely I mean subcool was that was

3685
02:33:47,398 --> 02:33:53,199
like the first

3686
02:33:48,719 --> 02:33:57,199
real you know um like a a laser point

3687
02:33:53,200 --> 02:33:58,680
focus on a specific flavor that for me

3688
02:33:57,200 --> 02:34:00,760
for like to some of the stuff that I had

3689
02:33:58,680 --> 02:34:03,200
tasted from him it was like so different

3690
02:34:00,760 --> 02:34:04,639
from like an Afghan or anything else

3691
02:34:03,200 --> 02:34:06,840
because it had such like a a really

3692
02:34:04,639 --> 02:34:08,799
interesting flavor to all of his stuff

3693
02:34:06,840 --> 02:34:10,600
and then and then when it came to like I

3694
02:34:08,799 --> 02:34:13,559
think maybe the first purple hash I ever

3695
02:34:10,600 --> 02:34:15,439
saw was was was when Matt rise ran some

3696
02:34:13,559 --> 02:34:18,159
of his stuff and it was and I was just

3697
02:34:15,439 --> 02:34:20,159
like holy [ __ ] what's hash can be purple

3698
02:34:18,159 --> 02:34:22,119
like what the [ __ ] is this and like so

3699
02:34:20,159 --> 02:34:23,879
he he definitely had a strong influence

3700
02:34:22,120 --> 02:34:25,800
on on everything and I think other guys

3701
02:34:23,879 --> 02:34:28,278
at the same time were like that I was

3702
02:34:25,799 --> 02:34:30,199
just thinking were like DJ Short you

3703
02:34:28,279 --> 02:34:33,520
know his stuff was was cracking at the

3704
02:34:30,200 --> 02:34:35,399
same time Soma you know I was I was

3705
02:34:33,520 --> 02:34:37,040
nothing changed my life I was an indoor

3706
02:34:35,398 --> 02:34:39,519
grower that was setting up houses my

3707
02:34:37,040 --> 02:34:42,120
buddies were were real estate dudes that

3708
02:34:39,520 --> 02:34:44,239
were loan officers so they were just

3709
02:34:42,120 --> 02:34:46,680
they were building track houses in the

3710
02:34:44,239 --> 02:34:48,680
in the Central Valley and I would just

3711
02:34:46,680 --> 02:34:50,639
go and they'd get a new house and I'd go

3712
02:34:48,680 --> 02:34:52,479
in and rip the thing apart and boom set

3713
02:34:50,639 --> 02:34:54,199
up the growing and I had a landscape

3714
02:34:52,478 --> 02:34:56,799
company and I would just go there and

3715
02:34:54,200 --> 02:34:59,040
mow the lawn and tend I had this system

3716
02:34:56,799 --> 02:35:01,358
set up and I did that and my life

3717
02:34:59,040 --> 02:35:04,200
changed when I found New York City

3718
02:35:01,359 --> 02:35:06,600
Diesel because it was so thick and so

3719
02:35:04,200 --> 02:35:08,880
citrusy and that was like s stuff at the

3720
02:35:06,600 --> 02:35:12,079
same time and it was just like that that

3721
02:35:08,879 --> 02:35:14,639
whole that whole era that we're talking

3722
02:35:12,079 --> 02:35:15,719
about like BPG and you know what the

3723
02:35:14,639 --> 02:35:16,599
other one I thought about the other day

3724
02:35:15,719 --> 02:35:18,920
was

3725
02:35:16,600 --> 02:35:23,720
Romulan like I would love to wash

3726
02:35:18,920 --> 02:35:27,879
Romulan right now and just see what

3727
02:35:23,719 --> 02:35:30,199
goes I was cuts too you know how I got I

3728
02:35:27,879 --> 02:35:32,358
was telling somebody this is how o OG it

3729
02:35:30,200 --> 02:35:36,399
was back in the day this is how I got

3730
02:35:32,359 --> 02:35:39,920
Romulan I was working for Ed and he said

3731
02:35:36,398 --> 02:35:44,199
we're going to a clone exchange we go to

3732
02:35:39,920 --> 02:35:47,680
an undisclosed location a van meets us

3733
02:35:44,200 --> 02:35:50,800
we put on blindfolds we put hoods on we

3734
02:35:47,680 --> 02:35:54,520
get in the van and we are driven around

3735
02:35:50,799 --> 02:35:57,759
for an hour then we are we arrive

3736
02:35:54,520 --> 02:36:01,439
wherever we arrive we take our boxes get

3737
02:35:57,760 --> 02:36:03,719
out we led into a house when we got in

3738
02:36:01,439 --> 02:36:06,760
the house then we took our hoods then we

3739
02:36:03,719 --> 02:36:11,239
were allowed to take our our I I eye

3740
02:36:06,760 --> 02:36:15,239
masks off and then we got high we showed

3741
02:36:11,239 --> 02:36:17,318
each other our plants and uh I got

3742
02:36:15,239 --> 02:36:20,398
Romulan and that's when we got

3743
02:36:17,318 --> 02:36:25,719
grapefruit as well but grapefruit was

3744
02:36:20,398 --> 02:36:28,879
what year was that uh that was

3745
02:36:25,719 --> 02:36:30,239
2000 yeah 2000 dude I'll tell you I'll

3746
02:36:28,879 --> 02:36:33,278
tell you the fact that you got

3747
02:36:30,239 --> 02:36:35,680
grapefruit and Romulan lends a lot to

3748
02:36:33,279 --> 02:36:37,960
your story that you got those

3749
02:36:35,680 --> 02:36:40,239
simultaneously because and I go way back

3750
02:36:37,959 --> 02:36:42,839
with Romulan since who I I don't know

3751
02:36:40,239 --> 02:36:45,719
who Romulan Joe got it from but I knew

3752
02:36:42,840 --> 02:36:47,680
Romulan Joe and how I met Romulan Joe

3753
02:36:45,719 --> 02:36:50,679
was Hillary hit me up one day and was

3754
02:36:47,680 --> 02:36:52,239
like listen one of you know the Growers

3755
02:36:50,680 --> 02:36:53,920

3756
02:36:52,239 --> 02:36:55,600
many Growers can you possibly have it's

3757
02:36:53,920 --> 02:36:57,279
been like six months she might she might

3758
02:36:55,600 --> 02:37:00,000
have had three of us and I was one of

3759
02:36:57,279 --> 02:37:01,960
them and so the other one was this dude

3760
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:03,279
Romulan Joe I didn't know it at the time

3761
02:37:01,959 --> 02:37:05,079
but she was like can you help out and

3762
02:37:03,279 --> 02:37:06,880
get this guy back set up I was like yeah

3763
02:37:05,079 --> 02:37:09,680
of course so I invested some money to

3764
02:37:06,879 --> 02:37:12,119
get his grow built up met him eventually

3765
02:37:09,680 --> 02:37:14,520
giant of a man teddy bear of a man

3766
02:37:12,120 --> 02:37:18,160
incredible but I got turned on to that

3767
02:37:14,520 --> 02:37:20,680
true true Romulan and it was just like

3768
02:37:18,159 --> 02:37:24,039
my god dude we could not get enough of

3769
02:37:20,680 --> 02:37:27,600
that [ __ ] someone's got to it's got to

3770
02:37:24,040 --> 02:37:30,760
and yeah it's funny enough I saw ramula

3771
02:37:27,600 --> 02:37:32,640
I saw ramul and Joe years later and he

3772
02:37:30,760 --> 02:37:34,359
just he was walking with a big jar of

3773
02:37:32,639 --> 02:37:35,639
weed and he gave it to me and I was like

3774
02:37:34,359 --> 02:37:37,640
what's this he's like oh it's freeder

3775
02:37:35,639 --> 02:37:38,920
Steve's old grapefruit cut you know I've

3776
02:37:37,639 --> 02:37:40,719
been I've been growing it you know the

3777
02:37:38,920 --> 02:37:42,600
Romulan and the grapefruit those have

3778
02:37:40,719 --> 02:37:45,719
always been my go-to so when you said

3779
02:37:42,600 --> 02:37:47,120
you got the Romulan and the grapefruit

3780
02:37:45,719 --> 02:37:49,039
that could very well have been from

3781
02:37:47,120 --> 02:37:51,479
Romulan Joe it would have to be if it

3782
02:37:49,040 --> 02:37:54,560
was the deal

3783
02:37:51,478 --> 02:37:57,799
anyway was huge I do remember he was

3784
02:37:54,559 --> 02:38:01,920
huge so this was 90 this was 90 uh

3785
02:37:57,799 --> 02:38:05,759
97 yeah so this I met ramul and Joe yeah

3786
02:38:01,920 --> 02:38:09,760
this was 2000 at an undisclosed location

3787
02:38:05,760 --> 02:38:12,279
in an area where I don't know so it's

3788
02:38:09,760 --> 02:38:15,559
just one of those actually actually it's

3789
02:38:12,279 --> 02:38:18,279
99 because I came in 99 so it was

3790
02:38:15,559 --> 02:38:21,760
actually in 99 because I worked from Ed

3791
02:38:18,279 --> 02:38:26,040
from uh 99 to uh just before an

3792
02:38:21,760 --> 02:38:28,000
01 um so yeah yeah and so then the same

3793
02:38:26,040 --> 02:38:29,680
thing once we did our exchange we then

3794
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:32,799
had to put the mask on then put the

3795
02:38:29,680 --> 02:38:35,200
hoods back on we were LED back outside

3796
02:38:32,799 --> 02:38:37,438
and then driven back to our undisclosed

3797
02:38:35,200 --> 02:38:40,600
location of which we then just all

3798
02:38:37,439 --> 02:38:42,639
dispersed so be thankful you can

3799
02:38:40,600 --> 02:38:44,960
actually go to a store and actually get

3800
02:38:42,639 --> 02:38:47,439
your [ __ ] cuz that [ __ ] was

3801
02:38:44,959 --> 02:38:48,759
nerve-wracking dog I'm not going to deny

3802
02:38:47,439 --> 02:38:50,239
dude they never he didn't give it away

3803
02:38:48,760 --> 02:38:52,478
to anyone just just so you know like

3804
02:38:50,239 --> 02:38:54,318
that had to have come like from a very

3805
02:38:52,478 --> 02:38:57,398
strong source to say hey you need to

3806
02:38:54,318 --> 02:39:00,840
give this to these people over here like

3807
02:38:57,398 --> 02:39:03,879
that people could have done that it was

3808
02:39:00,840 --> 02:39:05,880
By Invitation Only and Ed Rosenthal was

3809
02:39:03,879 --> 02:39:08,719
a genetics known guy in Northern

3810
02:39:05,879 --> 02:39:11,278
California so it could very well have

3811
02:39:08,719 --> 02:39:12,920
been I I it was so long ago I can't

3812
02:39:11,279 --> 02:39:15,920
recall

3813
02:39:12,920 --> 02:39:18,279
would we'd have to ask Hillary about

3814
02:39:15,920 --> 02:39:21,760
that yeah but it would have to have come

3815
02:39:18,279 --> 02:39:24,000
from Joe if it was the real ROM oh that

3816
02:39:21,760 --> 02:39:26,159
was the the the Romulan at BPG was

3817
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:29,398
definitely the real ROM that [ __ ] was

3818
02:39:26,159 --> 02:39:30,879
great fire that [ __ ] was so good I

3819
02:39:29,398 --> 02:39:33,199
remember that stuff hey you know I was

3820
02:39:30,879 --> 02:39:34,839
thinking at the end I I would bet money

3821
02:39:33,200 --> 02:39:36,960
right now that K from triome

3822
02:39:34,840 --> 02:39:40,359
Technologies was at that undisclosed

3823
02:39:36,959 --> 02:39:43,239
location uh where he

3824
02:39:40,359 --> 02:39:44,960
was definitely he he has that same he

3825
02:39:43,239 --> 02:39:46,680
has a a funny ass story I think he told

3826
02:39:44,959 --> 02:39:49,759
it to High Times about like haraldo

3827
02:39:46,680 --> 02:39:51,840
Rivera didn't he like blindfold Heraldo

3828
02:39:49,760 --> 02:39:54,520
or something like that yeah yeah yeah

3829
02:39:51,840 --> 02:39:56,680
yeah yeah that's just how it was done

3830
02:39:54,520 --> 02:39:58,880
you know because you didn't want people

3831
02:39:56,680 --> 02:40:00,639
to remember a location where you were

3832
02:39:58,879 --> 02:40:02,438
you didn't want a picture of an angle

3833
02:40:00,639 --> 02:40:05,559
because people could figure out at night

3834
02:40:02,439 --> 02:40:08,359
where triangulation of a star was I mean

3835
02:40:05,559 --> 02:40:10,600
get robbed like that's right and Romulan

3836
02:40:08,359 --> 02:40:14,680
got lost because of the white powdery

3837
02:40:10,600 --> 02:40:17,640
milde surge of the early o and it was

3838
02:40:14,680 --> 02:40:20,040
just one of those plants that was just a

3839
02:40:17,639 --> 02:40:22,719
[ __ ] magnet for it unfor fortunately

3840
02:40:20,040 --> 02:40:25,399
and it just you know that's why it kind

3841
02:40:22,719 --> 02:40:27,599
of made its way out and but I've yet to

3842
02:40:25,398 --> 02:40:29,318
find a genetic with that type of flavor

3843
02:40:27,600 --> 02:40:31,239
profile that it had it was Wonder

3844
02:40:29,318 --> 02:40:33,680
there's there's a cat in Sacramento

3845
02:40:31,239 --> 02:40:36,359
right now that has a genetics company

3846
02:40:33,680 --> 02:40:38,479
called Romulan genetics and they and

3847
02:40:36,359 --> 02:40:39,640
they have some crosses and some other

3848
02:40:38,478 --> 02:40:41,519
stuff and I've been communicating with

3849
02:40:39,639 --> 02:40:43,358
them but I want to see if it's actually

3850
02:40:41,520 --> 02:40:45,040
uh if it's actually the Romulan I

3851
02:40:43,359 --> 02:40:47,520
haven't I haven't gotten in touch with

3852
02:40:45,040 --> 02:40:50,160
them you you could tell a that's the

3853
02:40:47,520 --> 02:40:51,760
thing about the Romulan

3854
02:40:50,159 --> 02:40:55,359
if he gets

3855
02:40:51,760 --> 02:40:57,000
mold oh really yeah exactly everyone

3856
02:40:55,359 --> 02:40:59,318
that said they had the Romulan since

3857
02:40:57,000 --> 02:41:01,478
Romulan Joe stopped growing it just did

3858
02:40:59,318 --> 02:41:04,159
not have the Romulan I met one guy on

3859
02:41:01,478 --> 02:41:07,000
overgrow that had some Romulan cross and

3860
02:41:04,159 --> 02:41:09,079
I was like that has Romulan in it

3861
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:10,879
because it's kind of the Romulan is kind

3862
02:41:09,079 --> 02:41:13,680
of like the Shish ber in that sense

3863
02:41:10,879 --> 02:41:15,920
anything you put the Shish Berry into

3864
02:41:13,680 --> 02:41:18,559
I'm not sure if it was osine or what

3865
02:41:15,920 --> 02:41:20,559
profile it was but it just had this you

3866
02:41:18,559 --> 02:41:22,318
just always knew that the shishka berry

3867
02:41:20,559 --> 02:41:26,159
was in there it's in the Nicole from

3868
02:41:22,318 --> 02:41:27,879
marinos it's in the the Barb from uh uh

3869
02:41:26,159 --> 02:41:30,639
Matt the great Gardener you know you can

3870
02:41:27,879 --> 02:41:33,519
taste it in those cultivars that shishka

3871
02:41:30,639 --> 02:41:36,398
Berry and yes shout out to DJ Short

3872
02:41:33,520 --> 02:41:39,880
because he was uh yeah he was also a big

3873
02:41:36,398 --> 02:41:43,959
uh you know just producing fire uh at

3874
02:41:39,879 --> 02:41:47,358
that time you know early 90s late 90s

3875
02:41:43,959 --> 02:41:49,318
early 2000s and that yeah we were a big

3876
02:41:47,359 --> 02:41:52,159
part of those those growing you know you

3877
02:41:49,318 --> 02:41:55,680
know and Eugene in that

3878
02:41:52,159 --> 02:41:58,119
area mid 90s we were definitely I was

3879
02:41:55,680 --> 02:42:01,040
early 90s early early blueberry

3880
02:41:58,120 --> 02:42:04,640
everywhere blueberry and Trinity huge

3881
02:42:01,040 --> 02:42:07,760
strains in those times kind on

3882
02:42:04,639 --> 02:42:10,719
tour the kind on tour and that was all

3883
02:42:07,760 --> 02:42:13,800
DJ Short stuff out of Eugene also and

3884
02:42:10,719 --> 02:42:16,438
that was being all put on to tour also s

3885
02:42:13,799 --> 02:42:19,358
lived in Eugene before he moved to

3886
02:42:16,439 --> 02:42:21,359
Holland and then there was kind of cray

3887
02:42:19,359 --> 02:42:23,640
crazy stuff behind that what's

3888
02:42:21,359 --> 02:42:27,600
that did you know

3889
02:42:23,639 --> 02:42:29,478
Seuss Seuss s and Seuss they yeah s and

3890
02:42:27,600 --> 02:42:31,680
Seuss he was the parrot guy he had all

3891
02:42:29,478 --> 02:42:35,639
the birds he also the same area

3892
02:42:31,680 --> 02:42:37,639
abolutely yeah yeah that's those guys go

3893
02:42:35,639 --> 02:42:40,879
back the Blue Dream the Blue Dream the

3894
02:42:37,639 --> 02:42:42,559
flow and the blueberry were all created

3895
02:42:40,879 --> 02:42:44,438
right around the same time what do you

3896
02:42:42,559 --> 02:42:47,239
got there you got is that a is that a is

3897
02:42:44,439 --> 02:42:49,760
that a blueberry no this is Flo this is

3898
02:42:47,239 --> 02:42:52,079
actually Flo I actually

3899
02:42:49,760 --> 02:42:54,719
a bud of the flow that I grew when I was

3900
02:42:52,079 --> 02:42:56,439
living in La when I when I was had moved

3901
02:42:54,719 --> 02:42:58,519
to LA was working with Todd McCormack

3902
02:42:56,439 --> 02:43:01,639
there and I was growing on my own at

3903
02:42:58,520 --> 02:43:03,079
home and I grew this flow I loved it so

3904
02:43:01,639 --> 02:43:05,439
much I literally brought it into my

3905
02:43:03,079 --> 02:43:07,000
tattoo artists and said I want that here

3906
02:43:05,439 --> 02:43:10,520
he's like

3907
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:13,159
okay and then it the genetic disappeared

3908
02:43:10,520 --> 02:43:15,159
the flow made great hash too yeah he's

3909
02:43:13,159 --> 02:43:18,719
still make seeds of it I I have a few

3910
02:43:15,159 --> 02:43:21,639
packs of it actually I've good I gotta

3911
02:43:18,719 --> 02:43:23,760
say that DJ shortz genetics you know

3912
02:43:21,639 --> 02:43:25,840
really made a stance on dead tour

3913
02:43:23,760 --> 02:43:29,359
anytime that those genetics were brought

3914
02:43:25,840 --> 02:43:31,920
out on to shake down you could smell it

3915
02:43:29,359 --> 02:43:34,079
you know before it even even hit the

3916
02:43:31,920 --> 02:43:37,439
street and it was what everybody was

3917
02:43:34,079 --> 02:43:39,879
looking for so his genetics really spoke

3918
02:43:37,439 --> 02:43:45,120
volumes without you know having a name

3919
02:43:39,879 --> 02:43:47,119
attached to it at that time so yeah yeah

3920
02:43:45,120 --> 02:43:49,359
so many

3921
02:43:47,120 --> 02:43:51,920
different it's like now I look at it and

3922
02:43:49,359 --> 02:43:56,479
it's it's crazy because you have

3923
02:43:51,920 --> 02:43:56,478
different types of breeders now there's

3924
02:43:59,959 --> 02:44:05,559
like so big now so much so open that

3925
02:44:03,559 --> 02:44:07,278
it's crazy and it's like I just love

3926
02:44:05,559 --> 02:44:08,840
going to the the Breeders that aren't

3927
02:44:07,279 --> 02:44:10,880
hash breeders and looking at those

3928
02:44:08,840 --> 02:44:12,439
genetics and being like I wonder wonder

3929
02:44:10,879 --> 02:44:13,920
how that would be in hash or I wonder

3930
02:44:12,439 --> 02:44:16,559
this or or looking at the old school

3931
02:44:13,920 --> 02:44:18,040
stuff and thinking that's that's the

3932
02:44:16,559 --> 02:44:19,920
most painful thing to do to yourself is

3933
02:44:18,040 --> 02:44:21,800
to think of old school ICS and then how

3934
02:44:19,920 --> 02:44:24,680
good it would have been in like in like

3935
02:44:21,799 --> 02:44:26,639
rosin form or something like that it's a

3936
02:44:24,680 --> 02:44:29,439
good way to torture yourself right there

3937
02:44:26,639 --> 02:44:34,840
oh can you imagine the Romulan and rosin

3938
02:44:29,439 --> 02:44:34,840
oh that's what I'm saying that grape

3939
02:44:35,120 --> 02:44:41,359
flavor it keeps me up at night at the

3940
02:44:37,600 --> 02:44:41,359
end right that's what it

3941
02:44:41,520 --> 02:44:47,960
is original ha good grave we need a germ

3942
02:44:45,200 --> 02:44:51,240
plasm Institute of North America we need

3943
02:44:47,959 --> 02:44:53,599
a germ plasm of North America so that

3944
02:44:51,239 --> 02:44:56,000
all these genetics are saved so that

3945
02:44:53,600 --> 02:44:57,800
they're kept for posterity so that we

3946
02:44:56,000 --> 02:45:00,000
can't continue to have these stories of

3947
02:44:57,799 --> 02:45:02,159
lore so that they're actually protected

3948
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:03,559
so whoever's watching this get on it we

3949
02:45:02,159 --> 02:45:05,879
need that [ __ ]

3950
02:45:03,559 --> 02:45:07,840
yesterday I'd be okay for some of my

3951
02:45:05,879 --> 02:45:09,478
taxes going to pay for stuff like that

3952
02:45:07,840 --> 02:45:11,120
in society you know it's like well you

3953
02:45:09,478 --> 02:45:13,000
know we pay a certain amount for all the

3954
02:45:11,120 --> 02:45:16,200
philosophy strains that have been found

3955
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:18,040
in the twi we pay a certain amount for a

3956
02:45:16,200 --> 02:45:20,600
things stuck in there that have to be

3957
02:45:18,040 --> 02:45:22,960
bio remediated that Serra and others

3958
02:45:20,600 --> 02:45:26,159
have found out via genetics that they

3959
02:45:22,959 --> 02:45:28,000
have to pull out so if you you can TC

3960
02:45:26,159 --> 02:45:31,359
them but if you don't actually clean the

3961
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:34,159
genetic out of those bio problems you're

3962
02:45:31,359 --> 02:45:37,479
just perpetuating those issues and

3963
02:45:34,159 --> 02:45:39,959
inconsistency so there's yes it's just

3964
02:45:37,478 --> 02:45:41,358
it's a step further so we have we have

3965
02:45:39,959 --> 02:45:43,239
to get Reggie involved is what you're

3966
02:45:41,359 --> 02:45:46,840
telling me yeah pretty

3967
02:45:43,239 --> 02:45:49,359
much we gotta call on the flip side of

3968
02:45:46,840 --> 02:45:51,600
that you know also regener generating

3969
02:45:49,359 --> 02:45:53,279
old strains through really deep soil

3970
02:45:51,600 --> 02:45:56,079
multi- diversity

3971
02:45:53,279 --> 02:45:57,720
multi-species uh you know biome is

3972
02:45:56,079 --> 02:46:00,359
another great way to do it because then

3973
02:45:57,719 --> 02:46:03,639
you're just flooding that that that

3974
02:46:00,359 --> 02:46:06,120
plant's Endo fidic system and and and

3975
02:46:03,639 --> 02:46:08,719
flooding it with different microbiology

3976
02:46:06,120 --> 02:46:11,200
and then that really also cleans it so

3977
02:46:08,719 --> 02:46:13,358
just the opposite spectrum of when it

3978
02:46:11,200 --> 02:46:16,680
comes by utilizing our Farmers when it

3979
02:46:13,359 --> 02:46:16,680
comes out of tissue culture you got to

3980
02:46:17,079 --> 02:46:26,000
make inoculation Point

3981
02:46:21,760 --> 02:46:27,680
yeah out of retirement get you to to

3982
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:31,959
bring skunk back

3983
02:46:27,680 --> 02:46:34,079
Sam yeah what up one back we need it

3984
02:46:31,959 --> 02:46:36,119
like the yeah that's very important

3985
02:46:34,079 --> 02:46:39,279
there's there's some I'll wait another

3986
02:46:36,120 --> 02:46:42,920
few years until people really appreciate

3987
02:46:39,279 --> 02:46:45,920
it because why didn't anybody keep a

3988
02:46:42,920 --> 02:46:45,920
clone

3989
02:46:46,559 --> 02:46:51,199
good again

3990
02:46:49,079 --> 02:46:52,760
about the skunk one or the fruit one

3991
02:46:51,200 --> 02:46:55,560
because the skunk one all those people

3992
02:46:52,760 --> 02:46:59,680
got busted and they couldn't keep

3993
02:46:55,559 --> 02:47:02,959
skunk skunk one was originally skunky I

3994
02:46:59,680 --> 02:47:06,520
bred it sweeter I like the sweet version

3995
02:47:02,959 --> 02:47:10,278
had a better High flavor and effects to

3996
02:47:06,520 --> 02:47:15,000
me but uh yeah uh you gotta remember

3997
02:47:10,279 --> 02:47:18,920
skunk was never more than about 177% THC

3998
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:22,239
it was not no ball buster but people

3999
02:47:18,920 --> 02:47:25,639
consistently pick it over stuff that was

4000
02:47:22,239 --> 02:47:28,239
2025 because they liked it better yeah

4001
02:47:25,639 --> 02:47:31,079
yeah when I worked for Richard Lee who

4002
02:47:28,239 --> 02:47:32,559
did the Bulldog here in America I was

4003
02:47:31,079 --> 02:47:34,959
the guy who worked in his Gardens

4004
02:47:32,559 --> 02:47:38,318
because he was in a chair he loves skunk

4005
02:47:34,959 --> 02:47:40,519
number one but he liked that cut cut at

4006
02:47:38,318 --> 02:47:42,318
six and a half weeks that's where he

4007
02:47:40,520 --> 02:47:44,600
liked it as opposed to letting it go to

4008
02:47:42,318 --> 02:47:44,600
eight

4009
02:47:45,279 --> 02:47:52,880
weeks Rob liked it a bit earlier than me

4010
02:47:48,398 --> 02:47:56,680
too but I liked it maxed out because I'm

4011
02:47:52,879 --> 02:47:59,719
a resin producer I don't smoke weed what

4012
02:47:56,680 --> 02:48:01,279
was your max for

4013
02:47:59,719 --> 02:48:04,199
skunk

4014
02:48:01,279 --> 02:48:05,800
uh maybe 10

4015
02:48:04,200 --> 02:48:09,120
weeks

4016
02:48:05,799 --> 02:48:10,398
wow could you imagine skunky uh uh

4017
02:48:09,120 --> 02:48:14,640
rosing right

4018
02:48:10,398 --> 02:48:18,000
now I like the road I can remember

4019
02:48:14,639 --> 02:48:19,920
skunk that's what all skunk was it was

4020
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:22,680
Roadkill in the

4021
02:48:19,920 --> 02:48:25,879
beginning didn't Todd McCormack just do

4022
02:48:22,680 --> 02:48:28,200
a big skunk number one seed release that

4023
02:48:25,879 --> 02:48:30,679
he he did from like last year I heard I

4024
02:48:28,200 --> 02:48:32,359
heard that myth in that rumor Todd's a

4025
02:48:30,680 --> 02:48:33,559
good friend of mine I don't know what

4026
02:48:32,359 --> 02:48:35,559
that means

4027
02:48:33,559 --> 02:48:39,920
did

4028
02:48:35,559 --> 02:48:39,920
yes I heard that he may be at

4029
02:48:41,760 --> 02:48:48,120
Legends Todd Todd's a serious smoker so

4030
02:48:45,959 --> 02:48:49,559
I I've never seen him smoke a Hubbly

4031
02:48:48,120 --> 02:48:51,399
Bubbly though

4032
02:48:49,559 --> 02:48:53,799
Sam are you gonna come to

4033
02:48:51,398 --> 02:48:56,639
Legends no I'm not GNA come to

4034
02:48:53,799 --> 02:48:59,719
California uh first of all I don't think

4035
02:48:56,639 --> 02:49:02,278
it's safe to travel are you gonna do the

4036
02:48:59,719 --> 02:49:03,199
uh The Telecast with us so that we can

4037
02:49:02,279 --> 02:49:06,960
say

4038
02:49:03,200 --> 02:49:08,800
hi I'll consider it we can talk about it

4039
02:49:06,959 --> 02:49:12,079
but uh

4040
02:49:08,799 --> 02:49:14,438
yeah as soon as we can travel I'll be

4041
02:49:12,079 --> 02:49:17,159
glad to come to California and I'll be

4042
02:49:14,439 --> 02:49:20,720
glad to go many other places in the

4043
02:49:17,159 --> 02:49:23,639
world uh awesome but uh it it's still a

4044
02:49:20,719 --> 02:49:26,278
bit iffy to me there's just not enough

4045
02:49:23,639 --> 02:49:30,278
people are vaccinated in the world or

4046
02:49:26,279 --> 02:49:33,600
have had it already to make me feel safe

4047
02:49:30,279 --> 02:49:35,279
enough Y no it's true it's a definite

4048
02:49:33,600 --> 02:49:37,720
Factor at this point for sure for travel

4049
02:49:35,279 --> 02:49:39,880
I mean Mark can can people or Canada

4050
02:49:37,719 --> 02:49:42,358
just opened up I think but it's can we

4051
02:49:39,879 --> 02:49:44,799
can Americans go to Canada I don't think

4052
02:49:42,359 --> 02:49:46,960
we can yet right yeah I think the I

4053
02:49:44,799 --> 02:49:49,278
think the ones that have had their their

4054
02:49:46,959 --> 02:49:51,839
Jabs are allowed to come here I think we

4055
02:49:49,279 --> 02:49:55,238
opened actually to all International

4056
02:49:51,840 --> 02:49:57,079
Travelers recently that have uh their

4057
02:49:55,238 --> 02:49:59,238
vaccination which I get that the

4058
02:49:57,079 --> 02:50:02,159
vaccination keeps them from getting uh

4059
02:49:59,238 --> 02:50:05,559
really deathly ill or dying doesn't keep

4060
02:50:02,159 --> 02:50:08,159
them from getting the the virus so that

4061
02:50:05,559 --> 02:50:10,719
seems kind of strange it's like okay so

4062
02:50:08,159 --> 02:50:14,398
you're vaccinated or not you you can

4063
02:50:10,719 --> 02:50:18,959
bring the virus into the country my

4064
02:50:14,398 --> 02:50:21,199
brother-in-law was vaccinated twice

4065
02:50:18,959 --> 02:50:25,358
and he got the

4066
02:50:21,200 --> 02:50:29,760
virus so he was he had already had it he

4067
02:50:25,359 --> 02:50:33,040
was vaccinated twice and he got it

4068
02:50:29,760 --> 02:50:35,478
again also in British Columbia on no

4069
02:50:33,040 --> 02:50:39,600
comment no comment I'll leave that alone

4070
02:50:35,478 --> 02:50:39,599
as well um but I'll just

4071
02:50:45,760 --> 02:50:51,639
just so if you come to British columb

4072
02:50:48,639 --> 02:50:55,119
colia and for British Colombians

4073
02:50:51,639 --> 02:50:56,920
now some people who do believe in true

4074
02:50:55,120 --> 02:50:59,079
health and have other ways of healing

4075
02:50:56,920 --> 02:51:00,920
themselves will be banned from society

4076
02:50:59,079 --> 02:51:06,039
so you will not be able to go to any

4077
02:51:00,920 --> 02:51:08,200
restaurant no Club no music no uh you

4078
02:51:06,040 --> 02:51:10,800
can't have weddings public

4079
02:51:08,200 --> 02:51:13,239
transportation public transportation

4080
02:51:10,799 --> 02:51:17,119
public transportation um and from

4081
02:51:13,238 --> 02:51:19,478
September 13th till January 30th so it

4082
02:51:17,120 --> 02:51:20,960
might be a long time where you see a

4083
02:51:19,478 --> 02:51:23,760
good amount of people from British

4084
02:51:20,959 --> 02:51:27,959
Columbia CU some people need to stay at

4085
02:51:23,760 --> 02:51:30,920
their house he that's

4086
02:51:27,959 --> 02:51:32,839
ridiculous oh I suspect it'll end up

4087
02:51:30,920 --> 02:51:36,159
being like Austria where they just have

4088
02:51:32,840 --> 02:51:38,159
these really fast tests and if you don't

4089
02:51:36,159 --> 02:51:40,159
have that jab or whatever they'll just

4090
02:51:38,159 --> 02:51:41,760
get you to do the quick test and then

4091
02:51:40,159 --> 02:51:43,719
it's like yeah there you go I I don't

4092
02:51:41,760 --> 02:51:47,238
think it's going to be quite like uh

4093
02:51:43,719 --> 02:51:49,159
we're going to be a segregated apar tide

4094
02:51:47,238 --> 02:51:51,039
uh you know uh

4095
02:51:49,159 --> 02:51:53,200
obviously the conspiracy freaking me is

4096
02:51:51,040 --> 02:51:54,920
always like oh overbearing powers of

4097
02:51:53,200 --> 02:51:56,479
governments are somewhat terrifying

4098
02:51:54,920 --> 02:51:57,559
these guys do tend to [ __ ] it up more

4099
02:51:56,478 --> 02:52:01,760
often than

4100
02:51:57,559 --> 02:52:04,318
not on Marcus tell the truth what you

4101
02:52:01,760 --> 02:52:09,719
want is you want people to wear a little

4102
02:52:04,318 --> 02:52:11,920
yellow uh vaccination star on their

4103
02:52:09,719 --> 02:52:14,039
shoulder dude that's what they did in

4104
02:52:11,920 --> 02:52:15,920
North Vancouver near where I lived they

4105
02:52:14,040 --> 02:52:19,080
were giving gold stars away to people

4106
02:52:15,920 --> 02:52:22,840
who got two vaccines and I guess an

4107
02:52:19,079 --> 02:52:25,398
elderly woman um from like Poland was in

4108
02:52:22,840 --> 02:52:28,040
there and she lost it she was just like

4109
02:52:25,398 --> 02:52:30,159
what the what what are you what are you

4110
02:52:28,040 --> 02:52:32,399
doing it's interesting too because

4111
02:52:30,159 --> 02:52:33,799
someone someone I spoke to the other day

4112
02:52:32,398 --> 02:52:36,000
was like you know this is terrible to

4113
02:52:33,799 --> 02:52:38,478
make these correlations between like a

4114
02:52:36,000 --> 02:52:40,760
vaccine passport and the Holocaust and

4115
02:52:38,478 --> 02:52:43,559
I'm like okay but like this did happen

4116
02:52:40,760 --> 02:52:45,600
and it was in our paper and it was kind

4117
02:52:43,559 --> 02:52:49,079
of a connection between the vaccine

4118
02:52:45,600 --> 02:52:50,760
passport and you know the Hol cost

4119
02:52:49,079 --> 02:52:52,799
because the gold star was the thing that

4120
02:52:50,760 --> 02:52:54,439
got her it was a gold star now it wasn't

4121
02:52:52,799 --> 02:52:56,398
a six-pointed gold star it was

4122
02:52:54,439 --> 02:52:57,920
five-pointed gold star which of course

4123
02:52:56,398 --> 02:52:59,879
people in the comments section started

4124
02:52:57,920 --> 02:53:01,520
having huge arguments about but you

4125
02:52:59,879 --> 02:53:02,839
could imagine from someone from the

4126
02:53:01,520 --> 02:53:04,319
perspective of someone that lived

4127
02:53:02,840 --> 02:53:06,760
through the Holocaust that that would

4128
02:53:04,318 --> 02:53:09,159
leave a bad taste in their mouth and

4129
02:53:06,760 --> 02:53:12,880
maybe just do it a different way

4130
02:53:09,159 --> 02:53:15,559
thinkink Americans come to most places

4131
02:53:12,879 --> 02:53:18,719
in Europe unless they can prove they've

4132
02:53:15,559 --> 02:53:22,920
been vaccinated

4133
02:53:18,719 --> 02:53:27,358
yeah I think Canada's the same thing

4134
02:53:22,920 --> 02:53:27,359
oh yeah I'm lucky that I'm happy right

4135
02:53:27,719 --> 02:53:32,599
here yeah I mean I live in a forest with

4136
02:53:30,478 --> 02:53:34,199
the ocean out in front and I got some

4137
02:53:32,600 --> 02:53:36,159
food growing on my deck and some

4138
02:53:34,200 --> 02:53:38,800
cannabis PLS I'm feeling pretty good in

4139
02:53:36,159 --> 02:53:40,799
the in the area that I'm that I'm in and

4140
02:53:38,799 --> 02:53:44,519
I feel pretty healthy too I don't feel

4141
02:53:40,799 --> 02:53:48,159
that I'm you know yeah but it's fun to

4142
02:53:44,520 --> 02:53:50,200
travel and I haven't traveled a long

4143
02:53:48,159 --> 02:53:52,318
time

4144
02:53:50,200 --> 02:53:54,600
yeah know that's why be that's when I

4145
02:53:52,318 --> 02:53:56,719
see you Sam when I travel anywhere I go

4146
02:53:54,600 --> 02:53:59,760
in Europe boom into Amsterdam boom over

4147
02:53:56,719 --> 02:54:02,840
to Sam if I go to Spain well [ __ ] he's

4148
02:53:59,760 --> 02:54:06,279
like I'll come to Spain let's get a

4149
02:54:02,840 --> 02:54:08,719
place but he used to wear a mask and

4150
02:54:06,279 --> 02:54:14,279
just suck it up you know I've been

4151
02:54:08,719 --> 02:54:16,519
traveling you know it's not that bad

4152
02:54:14,279 --> 02:54:17,960
important sorry Marcus I think that it's

4153
02:54:16,520 --> 02:54:20,600
really important no matter how you feel

4154
02:54:17,959 --> 02:54:22,919
about the vaccine or or not the vaccine

4155
02:54:20,600 --> 02:54:27,520
that we all still need to come together

4156
02:54:22,920 --> 02:54:29,960
on um you know separatist uh ideology

4157
02:54:27,520 --> 02:54:32,439
and separatist roll out like this I

4158
02:54:29,959 --> 02:54:34,879
think that it's incredibly dangerous

4159
02:54:32,439 --> 02:54:37,159
those people who are showing vaccine

4160
02:54:34,879 --> 02:54:38,839
passports to get into a restaurant and

4161
02:54:37,159 --> 02:54:42,079
think that it's okay for them to sit

4162
02:54:38,840 --> 02:54:43,520
down and eat food it's not okay because

4163
02:54:42,079 --> 02:54:45,920
there's a lot of people out there who

4164
02:54:43,520 --> 02:54:48,439
cannot be vaccinated because of their

4165
02:54:45,920 --> 02:54:50,279
health and well-being of all different

4166
02:54:48,439 --> 02:54:51,840
kinds of reasons maybe they don't

4167
02:54:50,279 --> 02:54:54,439
believe in it because of of their

4168
02:54:51,840 --> 02:54:57,520
religion and that's a true thing maybe

4169
02:54:54,439 --> 02:55:01,479
they've had trauma with it we all need

4170
02:54:57,520 --> 02:55:04,359
to recognize that there is one major

4171
02:55:01,478 --> 02:55:07,199
sort of energy that's bearing down on us

4172
02:55:04,359 --> 02:55:11,720
right now and joining together is of

4173
02:55:07,200 --> 02:55:14,800
utmost importance it doesn't matter how

4174
02:55:11,719 --> 02:55:17,318
you feel about the vaccine or what your

4175
02:55:14,799 --> 02:55:19,000
Visions are about it we cannot be

4176
02:55:17,318 --> 02:55:21,719
separating out people people like this

4177
02:55:19,000 --> 02:55:23,879
it's not good it's just not good for all

4178
02:55:21,719 --> 02:55:26,119
different uh facets of humanity and nor

4179
02:55:23,879 --> 02:55:28,159
for our future generations and nor for

4180
02:55:26,120 --> 02:55:30,720
our health and well-being come on people

4181
02:55:28,159 --> 02:55:32,318
never have we been more sick than from

4182
02:55:30,719 --> 02:55:33,840
this and I'm not talking about just

4183
02:55:32,318 --> 02:55:36,519
sickness of covid I'm talking about

4184
02:55:33,840 --> 02:55:38,520
mental emotional illness that people are

4185
02:55:36,520 --> 02:55:40,040
having with separations of their family

4186
02:55:38,520 --> 02:55:42,600
because some people might feel that the

4187
02:55:40,040 --> 02:55:45,040
vaccine is okay other people are feeling

4188
02:55:42,600 --> 02:55:46,880
it's not okay when has it ever been that

4189
02:55:45,040 --> 02:55:48,479
somebody got a m measles vaccine and

4190
02:55:46,879 --> 02:55:50,238
then another person didn't but they went

4191
02:55:48,478 --> 02:55:52,438
to war with each other and they don't

4192
02:55:50,238 --> 02:55:54,639
speak with each other anymore this is

4193
02:55:52,439 --> 02:55:57,920
happening everywhere if we don't rise

4194
02:55:54,639 --> 02:56:00,719
above this then we lose all of us lose

4195
02:55:57,920 --> 02:56:03,238
vaccinated or not vaccinated so that's

4196
02:56:00,719 --> 02:56:05,438
my high horse and I hope that you all

4197
02:56:03,238 --> 02:56:07,719
hear this out of love and out of

4198
02:56:05,439 --> 02:56:12,479
kindness and out of togetherness this is

4199
02:56:07,719 --> 02:56:12,478
not about separatism this is not about a

4200
02:56:14,959 --> 02:56:21,039
vir our communing species that we need

4201
02:56:18,318 --> 02:56:23,039
need each other to be able to have a

4202
02:56:21,040 --> 02:56:25,319
healthy species into the

4203
02:56:23,040 --> 02:56:27,560
future yeah well you need to be able to

4204
02:56:25,318 --> 02:56:29,439
have dialogue we need dialogue and

4205
02:56:27,559 --> 02:56:31,478
that's the key what they did was you

4206
02:56:29,439 --> 02:56:33,960
know a little while ago they started to

4207
02:56:31,478 --> 02:56:35,398
compel speech and you know they did it

4208
02:56:33,959 --> 02:56:37,639
here in Canada where they went through

4209
02:56:35,398 --> 02:56:39,680
the universities and they were like hey

4210
02:56:37,639 --> 02:56:42,000
we've now made some new rules you got to

4211
02:56:39,680 --> 02:56:43,960
call uh people what they want to be

4212
02:56:42,000 --> 02:56:46,159
called and here's a bunch of pronouns

4213
02:56:43,959 --> 02:56:47,679
that come into play and there was like

4214
02:56:46,159 --> 02:56:49,559
there was this dude in Toronto a

4215
02:56:47,680 --> 02:56:51,800
university Professor was like no no you

4216
02:56:49,559 --> 02:56:53,680
can't compel speech and then of course

4217
02:56:51,799 --> 02:56:54,879
everyone was like oh you're against

4218
02:56:53,680 --> 02:56:56,359
Jordan Peterson they're like you're

4219
02:56:54,879 --> 02:56:58,719
against the transgender Community he's

4220
02:56:56,359 --> 02:57:00,960
like no I'm not against the trans you're

4221
02:56:58,719 --> 02:57:02,959
an anti-semite no I've actually tght

4222
02:57:00,959 --> 02:57:04,959
about the Holocaust they're throwing all

4223
02:57:02,959 --> 02:57:07,159
this [ __ ] at this guy and really all he

4224
02:57:04,959 --> 02:57:09,639
ever stood up for was the compel of

4225
02:57:07,159 --> 02:57:11,840
speech and who see who controls speech

4226
02:57:09,639 --> 02:57:13,760
controls what is defined as hate and

4227
02:57:11,840 --> 02:57:16,760
it's a very slippery slope you can

4228
02:57:13,760 --> 02:57:18,680
create um you know these discussions

4229
02:57:16,760 --> 02:57:20,398
that are now one-sided because and I

4230
02:57:18,680 --> 02:57:22,479
kind of try to remind people cannabis

4231
02:57:20,398 --> 02:57:25,599
was one of those things for a very long

4232
02:57:22,478 --> 02:57:27,478
time the people in the Cannabis World sh

4233
02:57:25,600 --> 02:57:30,880
I'll wait till I come

4234
02:57:27,478 --> 02:57:30,879
back am I

4235
02:57:31,079 --> 02:57:39,079
back Eland am I back you're back sorry

4236
02:57:35,719 --> 02:57:42,719
you're back the whole time yes

4237
02:57:39,079 --> 02:57:44,398
you you did one of these entire time I

4238
02:57:42,719 --> 02:57:46,318
was saying I was saying some good stuff

4239
02:57:44,398 --> 02:57:50,639
I don't know if I'll pull it back out

4240
02:57:46,318 --> 02:57:54,519
but um yeah I guess uh I guess that's

4241
02:57:50,639 --> 02:57:56,920
gone uh what were you smoking

4242
02:57:54,520 --> 02:58:00,600
again uh the last thing I hit was some

4243
02:57:56,920 --> 02:58:03,799
strawana 120 Micron F out

4244
02:58:00,600 --> 02:58:06,120
six-star okay don't expound in strawana

4245
02:58:03,799 --> 02:58:08,920
ladies and okay no I was you know what I

4246
02:58:06,120 --> 02:58:11,479
was gonna say I was just gonna say about

4247
02:58:08,920 --> 02:58:13,040
that they've removed the dialogue there

4248
02:58:11,478 --> 02:58:14,719
it's like through this Jordan Peterson

4249
02:58:13,040 --> 02:58:16,080
conversation of compelling speech now

4250
02:58:14,719 --> 02:58:18,159
they're controlling what you can and

4251
02:58:16,079 --> 02:58:20,680
can't talk about and it's reminiscent of

4252
02:58:18,159 --> 02:58:22,439
of the pot days where it was Prohibition

4253
02:58:20,680 --> 02:58:24,318
only the gnarly of us were willing to

4254
02:58:22,439 --> 02:58:27,040
speak we all seemed like we were kind of

4255
02:58:24,318 --> 02:58:29,119
insane no one really had to listen to us

4256
02:58:27,040 --> 02:58:31,560
because we were just crackpots and now

4257
02:58:29,120 --> 02:58:33,840
they've done the same thing for you know

4258
02:58:31,559 --> 02:58:36,478
whe could even get high

4259
02:58:33,840 --> 02:58:38,238
times no that's what I mean and so now

4260
02:58:36,478 --> 02:58:40,238
they're doing this similar thing on this

4261
02:58:38,238 --> 02:58:42,959
other discussion it's like look okay I'm

4262
02:58:40,238 --> 02:58:45,039
not going to choose a side right now

4263
02:58:42,959 --> 02:58:47,238
here but I'll tell you that at least let

4264
02:58:45,040 --> 02:58:49,960
both sides have a dialogue because if

4265
02:58:47,238 --> 02:58:52,199
you make one side so afraid 90% of

4266
02:58:49,959 --> 02:58:54,079
people won't be speaking that group

4267
02:58:52,200 --> 02:58:56,279
anymore and the people who do navigate

4268
02:58:54,079 --> 02:58:59,478
that group might come across this as

4269
02:58:56,279 --> 02:59:01,359
being a bit uh off thewall so you have a

4270
02:58:59,478 --> 02:59:03,679
better quality and a better caliber

4271
02:59:01,359 --> 02:59:06,439
dialogue if you can allow everyone to

4272
02:59:03,680 --> 02:59:08,720
not have to feel afraid for their

4273
02:59:06,439 --> 02:59:10,760
lives they want to have a discussion

4274
02:59:08,719 --> 02:59:13,639
about something so that's where I stand

4275
02:59:10,760 --> 02:59:16,079
and that's what I wanted to say yeah my

4276
02:59:13,639 --> 02:59:18,199
my opinion is it's not that I it's not

4277
02:59:16,079 --> 02:59:19,478
that I uh don't care about it it's it's

4278
02:59:18,200 --> 02:59:22,200
just that there are so many other things

4279
02:59:19,478 --> 02:59:24,438
that I care more about it's really what

4280
02:59:22,200 --> 02:59:26,159
it comes down to I'm just like it's sure

4281
02:59:24,439 --> 02:59:27,639
it's a conversation but it's just a

4282
02:59:26,159 --> 02:59:29,959
conversation if someone tells me that

4283
02:59:27,639 --> 02:59:32,358
they got the vaccine or not I don't

4284
02:59:29,959 --> 02:59:33,719
think any differently it's more you know

4285
02:59:32,359 --> 02:59:35,399
I'm like do whatever the [ __ ] you want

4286
02:59:33,719 --> 02:59:37,119
man I never and that's why I love being

4287
02:59:35,398 --> 02:59:38,680
a cannabis person because it's like I've

4288
02:59:37,120 --> 02:59:41,640
always wanted everyone to feel that way

4289
02:59:38,680 --> 02:59:43,960
about us so I don't [ __ ] care I'm

4290
02:59:41,639 --> 02:59:46,079
like I mean I like seeing people get

4291
02:59:43,959 --> 02:59:48,238
fired up I think that's interesting but

4292
02:59:46,079 --> 02:59:50,639
at the same time I I also think think

4293
02:59:48,238 --> 02:59:53,199
that it's like yeah we're losing we're

4294
02:59:50,639 --> 02:59:54,398
losing an understanding and and that

4295
02:59:53,200 --> 02:59:55,920
understanding is that like people should

4296
02:59:54,398 --> 02:59:57,559
have an opinion like let them have their

4297
02:59:55,920 --> 02:59:59,398
opinion you should ask yourself why you

4298
02:59:57,559 --> 03:00:01,318
get so worked up about someone else's

4299
02:59:59,398 --> 03:00:03,519
[ __ ] opinion that really should be

4300
03:00:01,318 --> 03:00:07,079
the question like you know why do you

4301
03:00:03,520 --> 03:00:08,960
care so why is it why is it that it

4302
03:00:07,079 --> 03:00:11,318
always becomes so political and it's

4303
03:00:08,959 --> 03:00:13,759
pretty interesting that the entire world

4304
03:00:11,318 --> 03:00:15,719
is dealing with this but yet American

4305
03:00:13,760 --> 03:00:19,960
politics comes into every single

4306
03:00:15,719 --> 03:00:19,959
conversation like I I really think we

4307
03:00:21,000 --> 03:00:28,318
separating our own medical freedoms own

4308
03:00:24,398 --> 03:00:30,719
body freedoms from politics people this

4309
03:00:28,318 --> 03:00:33,398
isn't about American politics they're

4310
03:00:30,719 --> 03:00:35,238
just making you believe it is yeah so I

4311
03:00:33,398 --> 03:00:39,599
think that really important that our

4312
03:00:35,238 --> 03:00:39,600
owns and our own medical

4313
03:00:40,279 --> 03:00:44,800
freedoms look at different things and

4314
03:00:42,840 --> 03:00:46,960
the information to be able to look at

4315
03:00:44,799 --> 03:00:48,879
all sides of it we need to be able to

4316
03:00:46,959 --> 03:00:51,119
gain education by looking at all

4317
03:00:48,879 --> 03:00:53,159
different facets of it and if we don't

4318
03:00:51,120 --> 03:00:55,760
have all different facets then we have a

4319
03:00:53,159 --> 03:00:58,520
very small conversation going that just

4320
03:00:55,760 --> 03:01:01,318
goes around in circles and that's what

4321
03:00:58,520 --> 03:01:02,880
happens when you politicize anything so

4322
03:01:01,318 --> 03:01:06,959
when you politicize things that's what

4323
03:01:02,879 --> 03:01:06,959
you do you politicize it so come

4324
03:01:08,040 --> 03:01:12,800
On's president of the United States

4325
03:01:10,719 --> 03:01:14,799
elect the clown expect the circus this

4326
03:01:12,799 --> 03:01:18,840
is all part of that circus ladies and

4327
03:01:14,799 --> 03:01:21,199
gentlemen sorry yeah I mean elect a

4328
03:01:18,840 --> 03:01:24,238
reality star as the President of the

4329
03:01:21,200 --> 03:01:27,040
United States end of story how about

4330
03:01:24,238 --> 03:01:29,159
don't allow who's the to affect what

4331
03:01:27,040 --> 03:01:29,960
we're trying not to talk about politics

4332
03:01:29,159 --> 03:01:33,119
right

4333
03:01:29,959 --> 03:01:35,478
now yeah you guys went there so I went

4334
03:01:33,120 --> 03:01:37,239
there too right I look at it from a

4335
03:01:35,478 --> 03:01:39,599
health perspective I take care of

4336
03:01:37,238 --> 03:01:43,439
patients I've been dealing with patients

4337
03:01:39,600 --> 03:01:43,439
the whole reason Addis and I knew each

4338
03:01:44,600 --> 03:01:49,279
other that got me an upper respiratory

4339
03:01:47,279 --> 03:01:52,800
infection because there was something I

4340
03:01:49,279 --> 03:01:55,319
couldn't see okay so that's still

4341
03:01:52,799 --> 03:01:58,159
ongoing you know even though the the

4342
03:01:55,318 --> 03:02:00,519
traditional Market is still going going

4343
03:01:58,159 --> 03:02:03,279
strong and going stronger than the legal

4344
03:02:00,520 --> 03:02:05,079
Market it's it's still not testing and

4345
03:02:03,279 --> 03:02:06,960
doing the things that need to be done to

4346
03:02:05,079 --> 03:02:08,879
protect the consumer at the end of the

4347
03:02:06,959 --> 03:02:11,039
day and that's the whole reason we did

4348
03:02:08,879 --> 03:02:13,398
it now the overabundance and the

4349
03:02:11,040 --> 03:02:16,080
overregulation has kind of ruined the

4350
03:02:13,398 --> 03:02:18,959
idea and thought but you know I am a

4351
03:02:16,079 --> 03:02:22,760
medical patient for one I have golf War

4352
03:02:18,959 --> 03:02:25,398
syndrome so I have my own sensitivity to

4353
03:02:22,760 --> 03:02:27,600
whatever however I have employees that I

4354
03:02:25,398 --> 03:02:30,719
have to take care of that we've worked

4355
03:02:27,600 --> 03:02:32,800
through we were declared actual people

4356
03:02:30,719 --> 03:02:34,159
who could actually go out in the world

4357
03:02:32,799 --> 03:02:36,639
and serve

4358
03:02:34,159 --> 03:02:40,318
others and we were also the first one to

4359
03:02:36,639 --> 03:02:42,519
allow the vaccine and I want to continue

4360
03:02:40,318 --> 03:02:44,079
to see people and take care of people so

4361
03:02:42,520 --> 03:02:46,479
yeah I don't believe there's two kinds

4362
03:02:44,079 --> 03:02:48,318
of science I believe there's one science

4363
03:02:46,478 --> 03:02:50,318
which is the replicatable science that

4364
03:02:48,318 --> 03:02:52,719
anyone could do which I think Dr Mark

4365
03:02:50,318 --> 03:02:55,000
and of course I would call him Dr Deora

4366
03:02:52,719 --> 03:02:55,000
because

4367
03:03:00,359 --> 03:03:05,960
he uh you know it's just one of those

4368
03:03:02,840 --> 03:03:08,000
things that science is replicatable and

4369
03:03:05,959 --> 03:03:09,559
you know let's fall upon science belief

4370
03:03:08,000 --> 03:03:12,079
is one thing but when you cross over

4371
03:03:09,559 --> 03:03:15,398
your door and effect and kill people who

4372
03:03:12,079 --> 03:03:17,478
I know which I know I just had multiple

4373
03:03:15,398 --> 03:03:19,840
friends die in Louisiana because they

4374
03:03:17,478 --> 03:03:22,438
decided Ed not to get the vaccine and

4375
03:03:19,840 --> 03:03:25,799
they had their obituaries and it's

4376
03:03:22,439 --> 03:03:27,920
terrible it's painful to watch it hurts

4377
03:03:25,799 --> 03:03:30,079
but at the same time you know I'm in

4378
03:03:27,920 --> 03:03:32,639
favor of vaccines but I'm not in favor

4379
03:03:30,079 --> 03:03:36,120
of mandatorily seizing people's ability

4380
03:03:32,639 --> 03:03:38,318
to speak or have their choice but at

4381
03:03:36,120 --> 03:03:40,600
what point do it cross over and it

4382
03:03:38,318 --> 03:03:42,359
affect other people when you're out and

4383
03:03:40,600 --> 03:03:45,760
about and going because that's the

4384
03:03:42,359 --> 03:03:48,760
reality is I have enough deaths on my

4385
03:03:45,760 --> 03:03:51,520
conscience from war try not to add any

4386
03:03:48,760 --> 03:03:53,719
more scalps to my reality sorry to use

4387
03:03:51,520 --> 03:03:56,960
that terminology it wasn't meant any

4388
03:03:53,719 --> 03:03:59,278
type of uh of attack of any one shape or

4389
03:03:56,959 --> 03:04:02,238
form it's just a reality of War

4390
03:03:59,279 --> 03:04:05,399
sometimes uh that's just the reality

4391
03:04:02,238 --> 03:04:07,079
that we face so uh I agree that

4392
03:04:05,398 --> 03:04:09,199
everybody has their right but I also

4393
03:04:07,079 --> 03:04:10,799
agree with science but at the same time

4394
03:04:09,200 --> 03:04:14,120
when we're out as a society and we're

4395
03:04:10,799 --> 03:04:16,159
seeing worldwide situation you know we

4396
03:04:14,120 --> 03:04:17,960
have to realize that we all have a

4397
03:04:16,159 --> 03:04:20,200
responsibility to our fellow fellow

4398
03:04:17,959 --> 03:04:22,759
brothers and sisters and what that is is

4399
03:04:20,200 --> 03:04:24,960
your choice to decide however I know

4400
03:04:22,760 --> 03:04:27,238
I've made my choices and I'm double

4401
03:04:24,959 --> 03:04:29,238
vaxed at the moment yeah and I just

4402
03:04:27,238 --> 03:04:31,520
wanted to I just wanted to add to that

4403
03:04:29,238 --> 03:04:33,520
that we all do have our own choices and

4404
03:04:31,520 --> 03:04:36,079
we also have a responsibility that when

4405
03:04:33,520 --> 03:04:38,520
we're sick with the flu or anyone has a

4406
03:04:36,079 --> 03:04:41,398
cold that you stay home everybody does

4407
03:04:38,520 --> 03:04:43,800
that you don't feel good you stay home

4408
03:04:41,398 --> 03:04:45,920
but we're not out there you know asking

4409
03:04:43,799 --> 03:04:48,639
for people's records on whether they

4410
03:04:45,920 --> 03:04:51,559
have HIV or whether they have syphilis

4411
03:04:48,639 --> 03:04:53,398
or whether they have Hepatitis A B or C

4412
03:04:51,559 --> 03:04:56,519
because all of those things are actually

4413
03:04:53,398 --> 03:04:58,119
contractable in restaurants so you know

4414
03:04:56,520 --> 03:04:59,200
I I think that it's really important

4415
03:04:58,120 --> 03:05:01,920
that if we're just going to be

4416
03:04:59,200 --> 03:05:04,239
separating out this one thing that we

4417
03:05:01,920 --> 03:05:06,960
need to really truly have the science

4418
03:05:04,238 --> 03:05:11,279
and the science is not just

4419
03:05:06,959 --> 03:05:13,599
hyperfocusing on this one virus let's

4420
03:05:11,279 --> 03:05:15,840
talk about all of it and all of the

4421
03:05:13,600 --> 03:05:19,079
contagion that humans are walking around

4422
03:05:15,840 --> 03:05:21,318
with so you know to be focusing on one

4423
03:05:19,079 --> 03:05:23,478
just really I'm sorry it doesn't truly

4424
03:05:21,318 --> 03:05:25,879
make sense if we're looking at the

4425
03:05:23,478 --> 03:05:29,760
science and if we do look at science we

4426
03:05:25,879 --> 03:05:32,318
can find lots of GMO style agricultureal

4427
03:05:29,760 --> 03:05:35,159
which creates super bugs and super

4428
03:05:32,318 --> 03:05:37,238
sicknesses so there's no guarantee that

4429
03:05:35,159 --> 03:05:38,680
everyone's going to get fully vaccinated

4430
03:05:37,238 --> 03:05:40,079
the whole thing's going to go away what

4431
03:05:38,680 --> 03:05:42,439
there is a guarantee is that it's going

4432
03:05:40,079 --> 03:05:46,639
to transform

4433
03:05:42,439 --> 03:05:50,680
and it's going to become something

4434
03:05:46,639 --> 03:05:54,318
different so if we're going to get into

4435
03:05:50,680 --> 03:05:56,960
mandating things let's get

4436
03:05:54,318 --> 03:05:58,920
mandating chemicals out of our packaging

4437
03:05:56,959 --> 03:06:00,679
and garbage going away and and and

4438
03:05:58,920 --> 03:06:03,120
acting health and well-being regimens

4439
03:06:00,680 --> 03:06:04,639
because uh the government's not

4440
03:06:03,120 --> 03:06:07,439
responsible for our health and

4441
03:06:04,639 --> 03:06:09,278
well-being we we are responsible for our

4442
03:06:07,439 --> 03:06:11,639
health and wellbeing or maybe instead of

4443
03:06:09,279 --> 03:06:14,880
spending billions of dollars on hand

4444
03:06:11,639 --> 03:06:16,799
sanitizers and masks that really po

4445
03:06:14,879 --> 03:06:18,759
possibly if we are doing the science

4446
03:06:16,799 --> 03:06:20,639
then we're actually recognizing that

4447
03:06:18,760 --> 03:06:22,079
that may not be to the best of our

4448
03:06:20,639 --> 03:06:23,719
health and well-being and actually

4449
03:06:22,079 --> 03:06:26,000
fighting this virus that we're all

4450
03:06:23,719 --> 03:06:29,358
dealing with if we spent billions of

4451
03:06:26,000 --> 03:06:31,478
dollars on actual knowledge and actual

4452
03:06:29,359 --> 03:06:34,880
science that when people get out into

4453
03:06:31,478 --> 03:06:36,920
the air and out in in into nature that

4454
03:06:34,879 --> 03:06:39,398
they're they're uptaking a healthier

4455
03:06:36,920 --> 03:06:42,000
microbiome when we laugh with people

4456
03:06:39,398 --> 03:06:45,318
when we share a joint in a circle are we

4457
03:06:42,000 --> 03:06:48,359
really truly passing more negativity or

4458
03:06:45,318 --> 03:06:51,119
are we passing more positivity so really

4459
03:06:48,359 --> 03:06:53,000
and truly Gathering and at and I hear

4460
03:06:51,120 --> 03:06:55,120
everything that you're saying I totally

4461
03:06:53,000 --> 03:06:56,639
want to respect what you're saying and

4462
03:06:55,120 --> 03:06:58,359
you're saying freedom of choice and I'm

4463
03:06:56,639 --> 03:07:01,079
saying right on brother thank you so

4464
03:06:58,359 --> 03:07:03,159
much for saying that but also I just

4465
03:07:01,079 --> 03:07:05,680
wanted to speak that there is science

4466
03:07:03,159 --> 03:07:07,799
and other facets that we aren't testing

4467
03:07:05,680 --> 03:07:10,760
for that we aren't isolating people out

4468
03:07:07,799 --> 03:07:13,119
for for providing their medical tests at

4469
03:07:10,760 --> 03:07:15,880
restaurants or in public Gatherings

4470
03:07:13,120 --> 03:07:17,960
because it doesn't make sense oh it's

4471
03:07:15,879 --> 03:07:20,519
illogical but speaking of science this

4472
03:07:17,959 --> 03:07:23,759
one goes to Sam specifically I just got

4473
03:07:20,520 --> 03:07:26,399
the iacm bulletin and apparently they've

4474
03:07:23,760 --> 03:07:28,079
gone under and are restructuring which

4475
03:07:26,398 --> 03:07:29,879
is the International Association of

4476
03:07:28,079 --> 03:07:32,799
cannaboid medicines do you know anything

4477
03:07:29,879 --> 03:07:32,799
about this or the

4478
03:07:45,079 --> 03:07:51,000
restructuring and how to try to do this

4479
03:07:48,719 --> 03:07:54,559
online thing which I believe they

4480
03:07:51,000 --> 03:07:56,879
cancelled for this October and uh I

4481
03:07:54,559 --> 03:07:59,559
think all the weight was on frano and

4482
03:07:56,879 --> 03:08:03,879
just a few people and so they're trying

4483
03:07:59,559 --> 03:08:05,600
to spread it out and reorganize it and

4484
03:08:03,879 --> 03:08:08,398
and also they're going to be more of an

4485
03:08:05,600 --> 03:08:12,680
umbrella Organization for all the

4486
03:08:08,398 --> 03:08:15,000
national versions of

4487
03:08:12,680 --> 03:08:18,680
them thank you for that clarification I

4488
03:08:15,000 --> 03:08:18,680
was Cannabis curious

4489
03:08:19,760 --> 03:08:25,040
I really like the work they do and fro

4490
03:08:23,200 --> 03:08:27,640
is a very special

4491
03:08:25,040 --> 03:08:29,520
friend and I appreciate what they do and

4492
03:08:27,639 --> 03:08:31,278
I hope they're able to continue because

4493
03:08:29,520 --> 03:08:33,399
they're stay at the Forefront of

4494
03:08:31,279 --> 03:08:36,319
cannabis research and getting asked to

4495
03:08:33,398 --> 03:08:39,159
us canaban nerds out here who you know

4496
03:08:36,318 --> 03:08:41,879
just want to see what's going

4497
03:08:39,159 --> 03:08:44,159
on and you know we're of course we're

4498
03:08:41,879 --> 03:08:47,799
hyperfocused on cannabis and because

4499
03:08:44,159 --> 03:08:49,639
it's a cannabis uh you know talk and

4500
03:08:47,799 --> 03:08:51,079
because we're also so totally entrenched

4501
03:08:49,639 --> 03:08:53,680
in cannabis and thinks it's the best

4502
03:08:51,079 --> 03:08:56,000
thing in the world and also the reason

4503
03:08:53,680 --> 03:08:57,639
why the endocannabinoid system was even

4504
03:08:56,000 --> 03:09:00,559
discovered is because there started to

4505
03:08:57,639 --> 03:09:02,559
be a little bit of money you know Sam as

4506
03:09:00,559 --> 03:09:05,799
you know money started to be flowing

4507
03:09:02,559 --> 03:09:08,600
into you know hemp and and cannabis

4508
03:09:05,799 --> 03:09:10,519
research for us to be able to even find

4509
03:09:08,600 --> 03:09:12,920
that but I wanted to open up the

4510
03:09:10,520 --> 03:09:15,840
conversation of you know there's all

4511
03:09:12,920 --> 03:09:17,680
facets of nature that are corresponding

4512
03:09:15,840 --> 03:09:19,520
within our body that are communic ating

4513
03:09:17,680 --> 03:09:21,318
within our body that have yet to be

4514
03:09:19,520 --> 03:09:24,040
discovered what about the herbal

4515
03:09:21,318 --> 03:09:26,760
cannaboid system so we talk about you

4516
03:09:24,040 --> 03:09:28,680
know compounding you know cannabis but

4517
03:09:26,760 --> 03:09:30,880
we have such a connection with all

4518
03:09:28,680 --> 03:09:32,920
different types of plants it's why we're

4519
03:09:30,879 --> 03:09:34,879
able to get high off of peyote it's why

4520
03:09:32,920 --> 03:09:37,799
we're able to get high off of cannabis

4521
03:09:34,879 --> 03:09:40,119
it's not just an endocannabinoid system

4522
03:09:37,799 --> 03:09:40,119
that's

4523
03:09:44,680 --> 03:09:50,920
just knowledge of us to understand

4524
03:09:47,879 --> 03:09:53,920
how Herbal Remedies are such a huge

4525
03:09:50,920 --> 03:09:55,879
factor in our health and well-being um

4526
03:09:53,920 --> 03:10:00,760
all the way down to you know repairing

4527
03:09:55,879 --> 03:10:02,358
our cellular DNA well into into future

4528
03:10:00,760 --> 03:10:05,238
Generations that's like what I was

4529
03:10:02,359 --> 03:10:08,079
saying earlier about health and and like

4530
03:10:05,238 --> 03:10:11,600
optimizing Health through biohacking you

4531
03:10:08,079 --> 03:10:13,520
know focusing on gut health focusing on

4532
03:10:11,600 --> 03:10:16,439
these other things so that you can enjoy

4533
03:10:13,520 --> 03:10:18,640
life like once I started on focusing on

4534
03:10:16,439 --> 03:10:20,479
gut health and and understanding that

4535
03:10:18,639 --> 03:10:22,959
all of this mitochondria is built in the

4536
03:10:20,478 --> 03:10:25,398
gut and and all your body's made of

4537
03:10:22,959 --> 03:10:26,919
cells which is mitochondria driven like

4538
03:10:25,398 --> 03:10:30,318
once you figure that [ __ ] out and you

4539
03:10:26,920 --> 03:10:32,760
start eating correctly to whoever you

4540
03:10:30,318 --> 03:10:34,760
are and I just say that because people

4541
03:10:32,760 --> 03:10:37,398
can eat you know there's food that's

4542
03:10:34,760 --> 03:10:39,960
served everywhere but have you ever sat

4543
03:10:37,398 --> 03:10:42,398
down and kind of figured out what you

4544
03:10:39,959 --> 03:10:44,959
eat best like what your what's best for

4545
03:10:42,398 --> 03:10:46,519
you like listen a lot of people aren't

4546
03:10:44,959 --> 03:10:48,079
listening they're not slowing down

4547
03:10:46,520 --> 03:10:50,640
they're not taking the time to do the

4548
03:10:48,079 --> 03:10:52,520
research to figure out what that post

4549
03:10:50,639 --> 03:10:55,318
really meant and and they want to speak

4550
03:10:52,520 --> 03:10:57,279
about it and that's the I mean you would

4551
03:10:55,318 --> 03:10:59,318
think that more people would smoke hash

4552
03:10:57,279 --> 03:11:00,880
because it slows you down and and it and

4553
03:10:59,318 --> 03:11:04,559
it makes you focus on little different

4554
03:11:00,879 --> 03:11:06,318
things and like my whole my whole J

4555
03:11:04,559 --> 03:11:09,519
everything I'm doing my whole Mantra in

4556
03:11:06,318 --> 03:11:11,439
my whole life is Hash it's simple it's

4557
03:11:09,520 --> 03:11:14,880
one thing it's that

4558
03:11:11,439 --> 03:11:16,960
direction and that exactly cream hash

4559
03:11:14,879 --> 03:11:19,278
that direction that one thing and all my

4560
03:11:16,959 --> 03:11:21,079
business falls into that everything else

4561
03:11:19,279 --> 03:11:23,159
falls into that and it makes everything

4562
03:11:21,079 --> 03:11:26,000
much more simple and anything outside of

4563
03:11:23,159 --> 03:11:28,719
that doesn't attract my attention that's

4564
03:11:26,000 --> 03:11:30,639
all you know it's like that's why I

4565
03:11:28,719 --> 03:11:32,920
called and was like

4566
03:11:30,639 --> 03:11:35,199
laugh because you're saying that all I

4567
03:11:32,920 --> 03:11:37,159
got to do is just you know focus on hash

4568
03:11:35,200 --> 03:11:39,760
it's going to be so simple but what

4569
03:11:37,159 --> 03:11:43,200
you're focusing on is a fractal medicine

4570
03:11:39,760 --> 03:11:46,680
that has 10 billion possibilities so

4571
03:11:43,200 --> 03:11:50,120
that's on that becoming so simplified

4572
03:11:46,680 --> 03:11:53,559
life work it's I like it it's working

4573
03:11:50,120 --> 03:11:56,560
out incredibly well up to this point

4574
03:11:53,559 --> 03:11:58,799
so staying in my Lane I'm just

4575
03:11:56,559 --> 03:12:01,680
continuing to do this and I'm grateful

4576
03:11:58,799 --> 03:12:03,879
that like how many people get to do what

4577
03:12:01,680 --> 03:12:06,559
they really [ __ ] love and I think all

4578
03:12:03,879 --> 03:12:08,839
of us get to do what we [ __ ] love I

4579
03:12:06,559 --> 03:12:10,879
mean Mark loves what he does Mark has

4580
03:12:08,840 --> 03:12:13,719
the fish thing and we all have this [ __ ]

4581
03:12:10,879 --> 03:12:15,959
in our life that we get to do because of

4582
03:12:13,719 --> 03:12:17,879
this because we understand that like

4583
03:12:15,959 --> 03:12:19,559
this is what we love this is what we do

4584
03:12:17,879 --> 03:12:21,639
but we're so blessed for that too we're

4585
03:12:19,559 --> 03:12:23,680
so much more we're that's why that's why

4586
03:12:21,639 --> 03:12:25,238
I started giving weed away when I did

4587
03:12:23,680 --> 03:12:27,520
because I would meet people that weren't

4588
03:12:25,238 --> 03:12:28,799
in such a good position and you'd Stoke

4589
03:12:27,520 --> 03:12:31,040
them out with weed and they'd be like

4590
03:12:28,799 --> 03:12:34,478
[ __ ] yeah and then you changed their day

4591
03:12:31,040 --> 03:12:37,479
and you had an impact on that

4592
03:12:34,478 --> 03:12:39,438
so it it was it's just that that's the

4593
03:12:37,478 --> 03:12:42,318
type of [ __ ] that I think people need to

4594
03:12:39,439 --> 03:12:44,318
understand that simplify first but start

4595
03:12:42,318 --> 03:12:46,439
with your health and then figure out

4596
03:12:44,318 --> 03:12:47,959
what you love and run in that direction

4597
03:12:46,439 --> 03:12:50,200
and be brave

4598
03:12:47,959 --> 03:12:51,759
and that's what life's about and do that

4599
03:12:50,200 --> 03:12:54,200
and all this [ __ ] falls into place and

4600
03:12:51,760 --> 03:12:56,600
be kind and loving and do that [ __ ]

4601
03:12:54,200 --> 03:12:58,960
right you know and that's the note we're

4602
03:12:56,600 --> 03:13:01,318
leaving it on right there that's the one

4603
03:12:58,959 --> 03:13:03,398
I like that I we you know we got into

4604
03:13:01,318 --> 03:13:06,079
some good stuff there for a bit but I

4605
03:13:03,398 --> 03:13:09,000
was going to crush this out at 12 I let

4606
03:13:06,079 --> 03:13:10,840
us go 13 minutes over got my little guy

4613
03:13:21,079 --> 03:13:26,478
hundred days since we had a hash church

4614
03:13:23,359 --> 03:13:28,238
so uh we'll see if maybe we can uh make

4615

everyone for coming and sharing their

4618
03:13:32,680 --> 03:13:40,238
truths and uh yeah fan Legends of hash

4619
03:13:37,959 --> 03:13:41,679
next month talk about that again some

4620
03:13:40,238 --> 03:13:44,478
