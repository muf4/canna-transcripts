6
00:00:14,669 --> 00:00:22,410
did we somehow have we somehow waken

7
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:24,210
banked 81 times together in the last 81

8
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,679
or so days I know we've been missing

9
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,118
Sunday's but we don't really miss

10
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:29,339
Sunday's because let's be honest

11
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:32,099
Sunday's are all about one thing hash

12
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:33,869
Church and last week two days ago or one

13
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:36,659
day ago actually holy [ __ ] that was only

14
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:38,099
yesterday that was a powerful Church for

15
00:00:36,659 --> 00:00:39,929
those of you that didn't watch it I

16
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,420
would definitely suggest going and

17
00:00:39,929 --> 00:00:44,460
checking it out we had Peter from soil

18
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:46,859
balance we had Brian from vital garden

19
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,500
supply we had Wade from the house of

20
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:51,899
Harlequin we had forest from the khalad

21
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,719
rias Network and then of course all the

22
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:56,250
old regulars we had mark Sheldon dr.

23
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,170
mark was in the house Etienne made it

24
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,850
back after his computer died stuntman

25
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:02,730
Sam was in the house to share his

26
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:04,530
knowledge with us as always it was one

27
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:06,810
of my favorite panels in a long time I'm

28
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:09,239
not gonna lie it was nice to see it full

29
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:12,750
almost all the way right up to the end

30
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:14,640
of church that shows that there was some

31
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,859
mixing up that was necessary there was a

32
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,019
little bit of stirring of the pot that

33
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:20,700
was necessary because it's been a while

34
00:01:19,019 --> 00:01:23,310
since we've actually had a full panel

35
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:26,150
like that and I'll tell you it felt good

36
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:30,180
in the meantime I'm puffing on some

37
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:34,250
heavenly days resins here we got three

38
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:39,719
different flavours from the green crack

39
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:41,909
sweet skunk and congolese yeah it was

40
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:43,408
great to see yea well jhonny bee wasn't

41
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:45,390
there Johnny bee was doing his thing but

42
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:47,909
you know what it's nice to see some d

43
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:50,489
420k wasn't in the house either and as

44
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:52,680
much as I love Johnny B &amp; D 40 for 20k

45
00:01:50,489 --> 00:01:54,780
it was nice to have some new people in

46
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,700
the room as well and that's you know

47
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,930
it's a hard thing when you start hashed

48
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,478
Church when I first started hashed

49
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:02,100
Church all my friends after inviting

50
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:03,868
them 3 or 4 times in a row kind of

51
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:06,000
became quite comfortable with the fact

52
00:02:03,868 --> 00:02:08,159
that they had a spot on hash Church and

53
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,889
that they would always be there so

54
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:12,539
yesterday D 420k was too busy and Johnny

55
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:13,250
bee was too busy and it opened up the

56
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:14,959
opportunity

57
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:16,849
for us to invite some other people into

58
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,920
the room and some of those other people

59
00:02:16,849 --> 00:02:21,530
were sharing a great deal so I guess

60
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:23,599
it's kind of the the hard difficult

61
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:25,520
choice to invite new people tell your

62
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:27,289
friends they have to wait I'll get them

63
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,050
back in next week obviously or the week

64
00:02:27,289 --> 00:02:33,349
after it's definitely not like a trading

65
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:36,230
in the good folks but it's hard to give

66
00:02:33,349 --> 00:02:39,439
other people opportunities if you don't

67
00:02:36,229 --> 00:02:40,699
you know ask your other friends or have

68
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:42,639
the opportunity come up that your

69
00:02:40,699 --> 00:02:45,349
friends aren't able to make it in so

70
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:47,238
John and Dee are awesome in the sense

71
00:02:45,349 --> 00:02:50,090
that anytime someone wants to come into

72
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:52,189
the room they're willing to move out for

73
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:55,219
so I've always appreciated them for that

74
00:02:52,189 --> 00:02:56,659
as well it can be a little bit of a hard

75
00:02:55,219 --> 00:02:58,459
decision you know sometimes when I don't

76
00:02:56,659 --> 00:03:00,109
invite someone they'll text me the next

77
00:02:58,459 --> 00:03:02,000
day hey are you mad are you mad at me or

78
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:03,530
they'll text me during church hey why

79
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,650
did I not get a link what's going on

80
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:09,229
it's like well hash Church is its

81
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:10,969
ever-changing experience and I think

82
00:03:09,229 --> 00:03:11,750
you're going to see it change more and

83
00:03:10,969 --> 00:03:13,669
more and more

84
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,659
yeah when Tony showed those mice I'm

85
00:03:13,669 --> 00:03:16,250
telling you I felt like I was getting

86
00:03:14,659 --> 00:03:20,209
pulled over by the police my heart

87
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:23,389
started beating um I don't know

88
00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:25,580
stink Bob you know we all get impressed

89
00:03:23,389 --> 00:03:27,829
by different things and so I don't know

90
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:30,290
it was a person at all I don't know it

91
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:32,390
was a smoker and it would be hard for me

92
00:03:30,289 --> 00:03:36,919
to answer you why you're not excited

93
00:03:32,389 --> 00:03:43,759

94
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:45,379

106
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,840

00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:36,550
there it is okay I need you to send me

111
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:38,470
an email I want you to say that it's

112
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:39,879
episode 81 I want to say that you won

113
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:41,530
the karma cup shirt and then I want to

114
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:43,240
see your address so I can just copy and

115
00:04:41,529 --> 00:04:45,099
paste it that makes it the easiest for

116
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,930
me there have been a few people who said

117
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:49,240
they didn't get their materials that I

118
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:50,978
sent that's a bummer I'd rather have it

119
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,990
get lost in the mail than not send it

120
00:04:50,978 --> 00:04:55,209
and be a sketch bag so please make sure

121
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:57,400
you send me that email the other day

122
00:04:55,209 --> 00:04:59,349
when I gave away the two pins only Arne

123
00:04:57,399 --> 00:05:01,569
sent me the email for the pin I can't

124
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:03,580
remember who won the other pin but they

125
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:05,110
never sent me an email so obviously in a

126
00:05:03,579 --> 00:05:07,569
couple of weeks when they text me and

127
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:09,970
say hey I never got my pin I'm gonna be

128
00:05:07,569 --> 00:05:12,069
like well you never sent me a message

129
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:14,710
you never sent me your your your address

130
00:05:12,069 --> 00:05:16,870
and stuff so it's hard for me hard for

131
00:05:14,709 --> 00:05:18,939
me to send that [ __ ] out without an

132
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:21,579
address not impossible I'm sure I could

133
00:05:18,939 --> 00:05:24,939
probably track it down but I think it's

134
00:05:21,579 --> 00:05:26,649
time for a wake and bake before grinding

135
00:05:24,939 --> 00:05:28,418
up the herb before making bubble hash I

136
00:05:26,649 --> 00:05:31,810
wouldn't do it you know I would maybe

137
00:05:28,418 --> 00:05:33,969
try that way at the end anything that is

138
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:37,060
going to be about you trying to get the

139
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:38,830
most out of it which is very much so why

140
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:41,259
you would want to grind the herb up

141
00:05:38,829 --> 00:05:45,728
anything that's really going to make it

142
00:05:41,259 --> 00:05:47,379
so you focus on getting the most don't

143
00:05:45,728 --> 00:05:48,939
do it it's counterintuitive and it's

144
00:05:47,379 --> 00:05:50,918
tricking you and it's going to [ __ ] up

145
00:05:48,939 --> 00:05:52,629
your quality I can promise well not so

146
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:54,310
much equality but your purity which will

147
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:56,079
[ __ ] up your quality if you break up the

148
00:05:54,310 --> 00:06:00,339
herb too small and you don't have

149
00:05:56,079 --> 00:06:03,009
surface area for the herb to float no

150
00:06:00,339 --> 00:06:05,739
survivor it won't shred the heads

151
00:06:03,009 --> 00:06:07,839
surprisingly the only thing that I've

152
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:12,668
seen that shreds the heads is micro

153
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:14,500
planing well I mean if you're planning

154
00:06:12,668 --> 00:06:16,569
on running it into rosin anyway then it

155
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:18,788
sounds like you just have swag I mean if

156
00:06:16,569 --> 00:06:19,319
you are grinding your bud and then

157
00:06:18,788 --> 00:06:21,719
running it

158
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:23,939
the hash that hash is obviously no good

159
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,200
because you want to make it into rosin

160
00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:27,629
uh don't get me wrong

161
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,519
rosin isn't like this horrible thing and

162
00:06:27,629 --> 00:06:31,290
happy 7/10 to all of you out there I'm

163
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:33,990
gonna have my rosin dab here in a second

164
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:37,310
but I prefer hash all day long today's

165
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:40,680
7/10 we're gonna smoke some oil but hash

166
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:42,780
doesn't hold oil doesn't hold a candle

167
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:45,180
to hashish so when I hear people that

168
00:06:42,779 --> 00:06:47,250
are like I'm just gonna you know make a

169
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,930
bunch of hash and press it I can tell

170
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:50,970
that the hash they're making is not five

171
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:54,150
or six star but it's more along the

172
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:55,680
lines of a two or a three star maybe a

173
00:06:54,149 --> 00:06:59,699
four star but when you're getting into

174
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:01,050
that high of a level of equality who the

175
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:04,889
hell wants to press it in the first

176
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:07,020
place not me that's who all right let's

177
00:07:04,889 --> 00:07:08,550
have a melty day and indeed yeah it's

178
00:07:07,019 --> 00:07:09,959
the holy grail dude I can't get enough

179
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:14,250
of it that's all just that's all I can

180
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:19,229
say about that all right so let's get a

181
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:26,250
little a little Congolese on the 710 for

182
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:28,230
our 710 rip oh yeah let's blaze I'm

183
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:31,050
telling you we haven't even had nothing

184
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:33,710
really gets the conversation going like

185
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:33,710
having a little

186
00:07:34,709 --> 00:07:42,810
say no to growing schwag say no to just

187
00:07:38,069 --> 00:07:44,399
growing swag well that's cool you know

188
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:45,780
some people do make it out of five and

189
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:47,038
six star although it's funny because

190
00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:48,599
when you actually get to their house and

191
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:50,279
you see their five or six star you're

192
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:53,720
like I think that might have been a four

193
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:56,819
star I think we're a little bit more

194
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:58,740
picky when it comes to saying what a 5

195
00:07:56,819 --> 00:08:00,930
or a 6 star is particularly because

196
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:02,639
we're grading not to sell but just to

197
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:26,098
tell people the melt factor of the

198
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:28,189
actual hash there we go Congo tastes

199
00:08:26,098 --> 00:08:28,189
amazing

200
00:08:30,709 --> 00:08:38,218
[Music]

201
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:39,810
you got terpene alene you got piney I'd

202
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:42,289
love to actually see a full terpene

203
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:51,239
profile down on it because there is some

204
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:55,828
definite magic going on there yummy now

205
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:59,450
it's time to get rid of this mild mild

206
00:08:55,828 --> 00:08:59,449
Chaz that's on my bowl

207
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:06,269
what's the genetics of schwag I don't

208
00:09:03,299 --> 00:09:08,609
know just ask anyone they're all smoking

209
00:09:06,269 --> 00:09:09,389
it and I don't actually mean that that's

210
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:12,180
not the truth

211
00:09:09,389 --> 00:09:16,528
really but holy [ __ ] let's be honest a

212
00:09:12,179 --> 00:09:18,539
lot of people are smoking schwag it's

213
00:09:16,528 --> 00:09:20,250
not something that I'm proud of to see

214
00:09:18,539 --> 00:09:22,319
out there in the world let me say that

215
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:23,909
much I just wish people were smoking

216
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,060
better I wish people took it more

217
00:09:23,909 --> 00:09:29,578
seriously and really tried to acquire

218
00:09:27,059 --> 00:09:31,708
the quality that they're seeking rather

219
00:09:29,578 --> 00:09:33,809
than just give up and decide you know

220
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:36,750
what this super swaggy garbage weed is

221
00:09:33,809 --> 00:09:39,869
fine good enough for me and I'm just

222
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:44,100
gonna blast it into some some shitty oil

223
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:46,440
and that'll be that for me no that's no

224
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:48,420
good that's that's not the high road I

225
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,160
mean if you watch the church last week

226
00:09:48,419 --> 00:09:52,110
it was or yesterday I keep saying that

227
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:54,149
like it was a week ago I really loved

228
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:55,860
the episode the whole conversation about

229
00:09:54,149 --> 00:09:58,110
quality the conversation about

230
00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:02,490
pesticides you know on one side you got

231
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:03,870
mark Michele Doan talking about how

232
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:05,730
people could potentially clean it up

233
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:07,289
using different things but then you have

234
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:09,778
like conscious individuals like skunk

235
00:10:07,289 --> 00:10:12,179
man Sam saying no we don't want to let

236
00:10:09,778 --> 00:10:15,720
people know that they can clean up

237
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:18,000
anything we want people to grow better

238
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,550
we don't want people to grow utter and

239
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,190
complete [ __ ] full of powdery mildew and

240
00:10:20,549 --> 00:10:26,159
and full of bugs and you know all these

241
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:30,420
different things we want like Wade was

242
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:33,120
saying like to grow resilient cultivars

243
00:10:30,419 --> 00:10:35,009
you know people like Sam I would say

244
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,019
that it would balance it well for your

245
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:38,549
Tomatoes Peter uses that product on

246
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:41,250
everything now I haven't used soil

247
00:10:38,549 --> 00:10:43,058
balance Pro but I like what Peter has to

248
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:46,239
say and I like his knowledge

249
00:10:43,058 --> 00:10:48,458
and I feel that he's a pretty honest

250
00:10:46,239 --> 00:10:49,689
fellow from the conversations that I've

251
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:52,568
had from him so I'm very much looking

252
00:10:49,688 --> 00:10:56,738
forward to trying his product on on the

253
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:58,509
roots of our plants Oh what do we got

254
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:59,739
pesticide free do you think that gave it

255
00:10:58,509 --> 00:11:01,449
ever back for the fire to make it legal

256
00:10:59,739 --> 00:11:02,109
against stating that it'll never be safe

257
00:11:01,448 --> 00:11:04,538
for consumption

258
00:11:02,109 --> 00:11:06,429
well Daniel Cruz that's you know a bit

259
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:08,818
of a tricky situation because keep in

260
00:11:06,428 --> 00:11:10,598
mind cannabis seems to be the only

261
00:11:08,818 --> 00:11:12,278
industry where people have a

262
00:11:10,599 --> 00:11:14,829
consciousness whatsoever because if you

263
00:11:12,278 --> 00:11:17,349
look at any under industry even the food

264
00:11:14,828 --> 00:11:19,778
industry the majority of foods that are

265
00:11:17,349 --> 00:11:22,239
sprayed with deadly chemicals and GM

266
00:11:19,778 --> 00:11:24,068
owed with deadly chemicals are not safe

267
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:26,528
for human consumption but somehow

268
00:11:24,068 --> 00:11:29,168
through that system they have managed to

269
00:11:26,528 --> 00:11:32,168
pay the bribes to get it so it is so in

270
00:11:29,168 --> 00:11:34,379
reality many many many things are not

271
00:11:32,168 --> 00:11:36,728
fit for human consumption

272
00:11:34,379 --> 00:11:38,709
cannabis just seems to bring to the

273
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:40,959
forefront we were talking about it how

274
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:42,458
some people will you know they it's the

275
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:44,228
most important thing to clean their oil

276
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:46,388
and make it as clean as possible and

277
00:11:44,229 --> 00:11:48,038
they will spend a day or a week or a

278
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:50,469
month trolling someone on Instagram

279
00:11:48,038 --> 00:11:52,958
because they have dirty beaut poop soup

280
00:11:50,469 --> 00:11:54,729
butane oil but in the meantime they will

281
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:56,438
eat fast food they will be a hundred and

282
00:11:54,729 --> 00:12:00,009
fifty pounds overweight they will have

283
00:11:56,438 --> 00:12:01,868
no personal hygiene and these are the

284
00:12:00,009 --> 00:12:03,668
things that sort of like are the

285
00:12:01,869 --> 00:12:06,399
dichotomies most of the things in life

286
00:12:03,668 --> 00:12:08,769
don't teach us about raising our bar

287
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:11,109
about like becoming more conscious but

288
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:13,119
cannabis does and I'm quite certain that

289
00:12:11,109 --> 00:12:15,549
it's because of the relationship we have

290
00:12:13,119 --> 00:12:19,749
with smoking it I don't think it would

291
00:12:15,548 --> 00:12:21,698
teach us that the same thing if if it

292
00:12:19,749 --> 00:12:23,199
were not being ingested into our bodies

293
00:12:21,698 --> 00:12:25,868
the way it is so you have this amazing

294
00:12:23,198 --> 00:12:28,899
plant that can feed us and clothe us and

295
00:12:25,869 --> 00:12:30,969
get us medicated and it teaches us

296
00:12:28,899 --> 00:12:32,558
consciousness it teaches us to be more

297
00:12:30,969 --> 00:12:35,289
conscious whether you're eating a meat

298
00:12:32,558 --> 00:12:37,509
eating diet or a vegetarian diet perhaps

299
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:40,178
you want to eat non tortured flesh

300
00:12:37,509 --> 00:12:41,979
perhaps you want to eat you know non-gmo

301
00:12:40,178 --> 00:12:43,718
vegetables you know there's levels to

302
00:12:41,979 --> 00:12:45,899
this [ __ ] and you learn about it in

303
00:12:43,719 --> 00:12:48,849
cannabis by starting as a kid smoking

304
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:50,168
seeds and stocks and thick paper and

305
00:12:48,849 --> 00:12:51,669
glue and eventually getting rid of the

306
00:12:50,168 --> 00:12:53,318
seeds in the stock and eventually

307
00:12:51,668 --> 00:12:54,689
getting thinner paper and eventually

308
00:12:53,318 --> 00:12:56,159
getting no glue

309
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:57,960
and eventually starting to take the butt

310
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:59,579
away from the paper and put it in a pipe

311
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:01,350
and then eventually taking the bud and

312
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:03,180
breaking it up and collecting the resin

313
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:05,399
and eventually taking the resin and

314
00:13:03,179 --> 00:13:06,929
separating it out from the non resin to

315
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:08,939
the resin and then eventually taking the

316
00:13:06,929 --> 00:13:11,939
resin and separating that out into

317
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:15,030
micron diameter increments and that's

318
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:18,290
how far we have come in this beautiful

319
00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:20,970
thing of you know the cannabis industry

320
00:13:18,289 --> 00:13:22,829
hey let's get sila I hope it's not too

321
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:25,560
crazy we got a lot of people in here

322
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:27,060
there's 234 people and what I find about

323
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:30,029
the group of people that like to come in

324
00:13:27,059 --> 00:13:32,219
here is that I try to make it

325
00:13:30,029 --> 00:13:34,230
comfortable for you to ask questions no

326
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:35,670
matter what they are you're not gonna be

327
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,500
ridiculed you're not gonna be laughed

328
00:13:35,669 --> 00:13:39,599
out we might make jokes and laugh with

329
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:41,970
you but we're not going to laugh at you

330
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,040
so whatever I like the idea of everyone

331
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:45,480
who's watching really being a part of it

332
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:47,069
and really asking their questions

333
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:49,050
sometimes you might have to ask your

334
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:51,120
question a couple of times because it is

335
00:13:49,049 --> 00:13:54,299
going fast and if you notice I'm talking

336
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,980
while reading as well as thinking about

337
00:13:54,299 --> 00:13:58,169
the next thing that I'm going to say I

338
00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:00,060
agree well water really good people in

339
00:13:58,169 --> 00:14:02,009
here I saw that you came into hash

340
00:14:00,059 --> 00:14:04,139
Church late yesterday I hope you did get

341
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:06,299
a chance to rewatch it you came in quite

342
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:08,100
late if I'm correct I remember seeing

343
00:14:06,299 --> 00:14:11,729
something about you at around the

344
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:18,330
three-hour mark Oh Matt my email address

345
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:20,220
is BC bubbleman at icloud.com the

346
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:21,840
history of the 710 I don't know it kind

347
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:25,320
of happened with the oil community it

348
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:28,470
certainly didn't exist 20 plus years ago

349
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:30,090
but maybe 10 or 15 I can't even remember

350
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:34,139
now as you get older you sort of lose

351
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:36,300
track of years and how you remember like

352
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:38,460
what oh that was just a year ago it's

353
00:14:36,299 --> 00:14:44,279
like no it was like seven years ago oh

354
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:45,870
[ __ ] crazy ah they're nice to hear Cuban

355
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:48,600
chronic nice to hear Cuban chronic

356
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:50,820
somehow got blocked out of our chat for

357
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,649
a while so welcome back to him you did

358
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:57,000

360
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,279
t-shirt right there in fact I should

361
00:14:59,129 --> 00:15:04,230
pull it out right now he's set a large

362
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:06,449
and there is his t-shirt oh I didn't

363
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:08,220
even see the front that's pretty nice

364
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:11,640

tshirt that good that good let's thank

366
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:15,949
Sara Sunday for that you know Sara I've

367
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:19,710
said it before and I'll say it again

368
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:22,200
she's an extremely capable person so you

369
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:24,120
know for me my whole worry is when I go

370
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:26,100
to an event that my money that I spend

371
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,690
is going to be made worthwhile but the

372
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,250
person putting on the event is going to

373
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:31,680
make a point on touching enough people

374
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:32,970
that they bring to the event and that

375
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:35,819
the venues and everything you're gonna

376
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:37,620
be good and like I said Sara can do it

377
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:39,090
Sara can pull it off so I hope to see

378
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:41,639
some of you guys out there at the Karma

379
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:46,320
Cup September 9th and 10th I'll be out

380
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:47,939
there should be fun should be good do

381
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,040
you have any UK retailers to get your

382
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:53,750
bags from well so atlas UK yes you can

383
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:56,399
get my bags from pure sativa that is my

384
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:59,909
distributor for over 10 years now emit

385
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:02,309
from pure sativa great guy great company

386
00:15:59,909 --> 00:16:04,799
he has good products as well like if you

387
00:16:02,309 --> 00:16:06,149
get his catalogue you'll see that it's

388
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:08,819
good stuff I'm not sure if he actually

389
00:16:06,149 --> 00:16:11,819
does retail as well as wholesale

390
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:15,480
although I suspect he would just Google

391
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:17,820
pure sativa UK and you'll get that in

392
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:27,060
touch with them hey what's going on Ken

393
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:29,520
Sharky Carribean trichomes I'm sure I

394
00:16:27,059 --> 00:16:31,019
mean if you buy yourself a karma cup I'm

395
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,189
pretty sure you just get like a big I

396
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:33,750
don't even know how it works to be

397
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:36,720
honest I would get in touch with them at

398
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:39,149
the Karma cup calm and ask any of your

399
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,190
more detailed questions that require

400
00:16:39,149 --> 00:16:43,889
answers like about the contest and I

401
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:45,210
don't think you'll need a card but yeah

402
00:16:43,889 --> 00:16:47,720
if you have your Michigan card you

403
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:49,769
should be fine Canada is pretty chill

404
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:52,410
it's kind of an interesting thing

405
00:16:49,769 --> 00:16:55,769
because you know from the way I look at

406
00:16:52,409 --> 00:16:59,750
it is this it's a double standard in the

407
00:16:55,769 --> 00:17:02,490
sense that showing a card for a medical

408
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:04,799
for something medical seems to be a

409
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:07,289
breach of our Charter of Rights here in

410
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:10,049
Canada like why would I have to tell you

411
00:17:07,289 --> 00:17:12,920
that I have something that I need to

412
00:17:10,049 --> 00:17:14,849
take a medicine for that would be

413
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:17,130
ridiculous that would be like giving

414
00:17:14,849 --> 00:17:19,759
diabetics a card so if they got caught

415
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:22,970
with syringes they could say oh no no no

416
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:25,548
this is just a diabetic syringe I have a

417
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:27,740
diabetes card and I'm allowed to have

418
00:17:25,548 --> 00:17:30,558
these syringes it's completely [ __ ]

419
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:32,240
ridiculous and so when I opened my vapor

420
00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:34,609
bar in 2003

421
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,200
I would never card anyone because it was

422
00:17:34,609 --> 00:17:37,428
not in my position I'm not the police

423
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,558
I'm not the government

424
00:17:37,429 --> 00:17:42,048
I have no reason why I would want to

425
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:44,240
know if someone has a card and so I

426
00:17:42,048 --> 00:17:46,250
allowed in a sense everyone who wanted

427
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:51,109
to vaporize with their own material at

428
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:54,250
my vapor bar because it was not my right

429
00:17:51,109 --> 00:17:57,709
to ask people about their private

430
00:17:54,250 --> 00:18:00,619
medical records are confidential you

431
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:02,960
understand even your dental records are

432
00:18:00,619 --> 00:18:04,369
confidential so come on medical records

433
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,009
and then people are just gonna be like

434
00:18:04,369 --> 00:18:10,639
hey I want to know if you use cannabis

435
00:18:07,009 --> 00:18:12,410
medically I never claimed that the

436
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,690
sessile heads are not that good actually

437
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:17,269
Mike Michaels the sessile capitate

438
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:19,279
sessile and the capitate stocked are two

439
00:18:17,269 --> 00:18:20,960
of the heads that you those are the ones

440
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:23,029
that you're mostly getting when you do

441
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,819
extractions with screens whether bubble

442
00:18:23,029 --> 00:18:28,308
bags or dry sifting that's just a fact

443
00:18:25,819 --> 00:18:32,119
the bulbous heads tend to stick to the

444
00:18:28,308 --> 00:18:33,678
leaves on their singular cellular stocks

445
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:35,209
it's almost looks like they have no

446
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,530
stock at all they just look like a head

447
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:38,960
and they're stuck on the leaf and

448
00:18:36,529 --> 00:18:41,690
because of that they don't have quite

449
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,160
that motion and snapping you can get

450
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:45,730
some of them don't get me wrong and I'm

451
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:49,610
sure the 25 micron bag is ripe with them

452
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:51,650
but oil gets the majority of them and

453
00:18:49,609 --> 00:18:54,709
that's why you see bubble hash never

454
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:56,240
gets the same yield as oil and for the

455
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:59,779
longest time people were convinced that

456
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:02,839
they were acquiring oils that were

457
00:18:59,779 --> 00:19:05,178
inside the plant I am still not on that

458
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:06,678
page from what I know about science all

459
00:19:05,179 --> 00:19:09,460
of the glandular trichomes and

460
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:09,460
cannabinoids and terpenoids

461
00:19:10,869 --> 00:19:16,129
not inside anywhere else of the plant

462
00:19:13,669 --> 00:19:18,259
I've separated the plant all out and bio

463
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:19,970
assayed it and I found with my own mind

464
00:19:18,259 --> 00:19:21,619
when I smoked all the components of the

465
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:24,679
plant that only the glandular trichomes

466
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:26,949
gave me actual effect of cannabinoids

467
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:26,950
and terpenoids

468
00:19:29,509 --> 00:19:34,039
they come from and so you it's very easy

469
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:37,009
to run a batch of something with through

470
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:39,259
bubble bags and then run it through run

471
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:41,569
the same stuff but that hasn't been run

472
00:19:39,259 --> 00:19:43,220
you know separate two piles run one

473
00:19:41,569 --> 00:19:45,259
through water hash and one run through

474
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:46,940
run one through oil and you'll see

475
00:19:45,259 --> 00:19:48,829
clearly that one is going to yield

476
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:51,380
higher and that's going to yield higher

477
00:19:48,829 --> 00:19:53,509
because of those bulbous heads not

478
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:56,150
because there's resin hiding inside the

479
00:19:53,509 --> 00:19:58,160
plant or though hey science could tell

480
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:59,990
me that that is the case tomorrow and

481
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,240
trust me I would learn about it and I

482
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:04,490
would accept it I'm mostly accepting

483
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:08,750
like stuntman Sam of the truth whatever

484
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:10,640
the truth may be the first strain of

485
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:12,890
real bubble I ever made was shish kebab

486
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,420
I had made a couple of batches prior to

487
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:17,180
that and I don't even remember and then

488
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:20,000
really the real real bubble the real

489
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:24,920
first bubble that kind of beyond blew me

490
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:26,539
away was yeah 15 times that's well if

491
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:29,750
you put enough material in there you

492
00:20:26,539 --> 00:20:31,430
could wash it 15 times absolutely for me

493
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:34,579
here's the thing there's only a certain

494
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:36,350
yield to be had on these materials it's

495
00:20:34,579 --> 00:20:38,750
very easy to find that yield you can

496
00:20:36,349 --> 00:20:40,969
squish it with your hair straightener or

497
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:43,519
your rosin press and that will give you

498
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:45,230
your glandular trichomes full-spectrum

499
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:49,639
yield it'll tell you whether you have

500
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:51,860
17% or 21% or 13% and through that

501
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:53,960
number you can then go and run it

502
00:20:51,859 --> 00:20:56,329
through bubble and really get an idea

503
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:58,730
bubble hash is extremely efficient I can

504
00:20:56,329 --> 00:21:00,529
get 90 plus percent of the medicine off

505
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:02,089
of the plant the medicine that I'm

506
00:21:00,529 --> 00:21:04,759
looking for the medicine that I want to

507
00:21:02,089 --> 00:21:08,419
inhale the micro encapsulated trichome

508
00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:09,950
heads that I'm looking for and you know

509
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:11,539
so I've always found people that are

510
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:13,069
washing it many many many many many many

511
00:21:11,539 --> 00:21:16,279
times or they're trying to make their

512
00:21:13,069 --> 00:21:18,919
freezer colder or their washer colder I

513
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:21,019
just asked them are what is the deal

514
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:23,000
with that like what are you improving on

515
00:21:21,019 --> 00:21:25,069
because water hash is so simple and so

516
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,289
perfect that it's like you use water and

517
00:21:25,069 --> 00:21:30,799
ice and you break the glands and they

518
00:21:27,289 --> 00:21:33,889
sink if you're getting your yield you

519
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:35,899
know what is the purpose you know what I

520
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:37,790
mean is are there claims that oh I

521
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:40,009
watched it 15 times so instead of giving

522
00:21:37,789 --> 00:21:42,049
12% I got 29%

523
00:21:40,009 --> 00:21:43,879
I guarantee you not

524
00:21:42,049 --> 00:21:46,519
tu you can get the majority of your

525
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:48,740
yield in a very very short period of

526
00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:50,240
time so these people they're coming up

527
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:52,940
with all sorts of unique things and I

528
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:55,880
get it I think personally it's more

529
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:57,380
connected to the way we all are and how

530
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:00,080
we want to do things through our own

531
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:02,330
lenses and it's it's kind of like it

532
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:03,829
makes it ours as well I saw that from

533
00:22:02,329 --> 00:22:05,839
day one of starting the bubble bags

534
00:22:03,829 --> 00:22:08,210
because I would just put the directions

535
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:10,459
out I never felt like I owned the

536
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:12,440
directions I felt like I was sharing

537
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:14,569
them and as I was sharing them people

538
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:15,860
would say oh I do it different I do it

539
00:22:14,569 --> 00:22:18,230
different I do it different they were

540
00:22:15,859 --> 00:22:19,909
all coming up with their own tax which

541
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:23,089
coincidentally enough created their own

542
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:25,160
companies that's fine for me I never

543
00:22:23,089 --> 00:22:27,319
felt like I owned it I felt like I was

544
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:29,540
sharing information that people needed

545
00:22:27,319 --> 00:22:31,189
to know and so the only reason I even

546
00:22:29,539 --> 00:22:33,740
came up with the name bubble and bubble

547
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:36,320
hash and bubble man was because I didn't

548
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:38,120
want to bite anything that the isolator

549
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:40,789
company had already done I wanted to

550
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:42,529
stay away from any type of that energy

551
00:22:40,789 --> 00:22:45,950
so I could just do my own thing

552
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:50,930
and since I did that it's turned in much

553
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:53,660
more to a just everyone kind of creating

554
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:56,779
it like oh well I make ice oil I make

555
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:58,370
ice wax I make solvent list I make and

556
00:22:56,779 --> 00:22:59,599
people would contact me and say what's

557
00:22:58,369 --> 00:23:01,629
the difference and I'd be like well to

558
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:04,849
be honest they're all guys using my bags

559
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:06,500
making water hash so I would call bubble

560
00:23:04,849 --> 00:23:08,839
hash I started calling it water hash

561
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:10,970
because it was more accurate in the

562
00:23:08,839 --> 00:23:12,649
sense that you know all the bags will

563
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:15,620
make water hash it's just about

564
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:17,300
isolating glandular trichomes heads to

565
00:23:15,619 --> 00:23:20,149
the to the best of your abilities and

566
00:23:17,299 --> 00:23:22,339
then there are simple sort of little

567
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:24,680
truths little tips that if you follow

568
00:23:22,339 --> 00:23:27,139
the simple tips like keeping it cold

569
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:29,450
keep lots of ice present don't overmix

570
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:31,670
don't overstuff simple things that you

571
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:34,069
realize when you do those things the

572
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:35,870
sweet spot of your extraction and by

573
00:23:34,069 --> 00:23:38,059
that I don't mean quality that's another

574
00:23:35,869 --> 00:23:40,099
thing people got all wrong its purity

575
00:23:38,059 --> 00:23:43,009
bubble hash is about purity we're

576
00:23:40,099 --> 00:23:44,839
isolating glands to 99.9% gland head

577
00:23:43,009 --> 00:23:48,019
ratios it had nothing it has nothing to

578
00:23:44,839 --> 00:23:50,509
do with quality it may unveil quality

579
00:23:48,019 --> 00:23:52,730
but trust me when you're using bags to

580
00:23:50,509 --> 00:23:55,240
make hash you are not making or

581
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:59,679
responsible for the quality of said hash

582
00:23:55,240 --> 00:24:02,049
now if you grew that material then you

583
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:04,990
are somewhat responsible you and the

584
00:24:02,049 --> 00:24:08,289
genetics did a great job and the resin

585
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:10,210
is melty and the bubble bags have spoken

586
00:24:08,289 --> 00:24:12,308
they are the Word of God when it comes

587
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:15,130
to purity and quality because generally

588
00:24:12,308 --> 00:24:18,099
if you purified a 99.9 percent heads and

589
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:20,050
it's not mounting everyone always says

590
00:24:18,099 --> 00:24:22,869
the same thing what's wrong with my

591
00:24:20,049 --> 00:24:25,149
material and I'll start with it could be

592
00:24:22,869 --> 00:24:27,609
your genetics it could be you it could

593
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:29,860
be you and your genetics like those are

594
00:24:27,609 --> 00:24:32,019
the three main combinations that are

595
00:24:29,859 --> 00:24:34,149
going to be responsible for why your

596
00:24:32,019 --> 00:24:38,019
bubble is not melting if you're the

597
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:40,480
grower of your material I wash a couple

598
00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:42,759
hundred grams dry you know maybe six to

599
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:45,720
seven hundred wet in a five gallon batch

600
00:24:42,759 --> 00:24:48,549
and I make sure there's a ton of yeah

601
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:51,250
lack of and you can call it lack of love

602
00:24:48,549 --> 00:24:52,960
you can call it lack of focus lack of

603
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:56,109
attention but that's what it is people

604
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:59,079
are just being loose with things and the

605
00:24:56,109 --> 00:25:01,149
bags the bags were always meant to be a

606
00:24:59,079 --> 00:25:03,549
very simple tool that you could you know

607
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:05,860
test materials with you could learn

608
00:25:03,549 --> 00:25:07,869
about how well you grew you could you

609
00:25:05,859 --> 00:25:10,899
could check your your efficacy your

610
00:25:07,869 --> 00:25:15,219
efficiency I should say how well you

611
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:16,960
grew that resin will be shown in the

612
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:18,579
resin that you extract from the bags

613
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,929
they are bags of truth I've always

614
00:25:18,579 --> 00:25:21,609
called them the word of god when it

615
00:25:19,929 --> 00:25:23,650
comes to the quality of your product

616
00:25:21,609 --> 00:25:26,109
because they're gonna get everything

617
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:28,090
else away and then all these different

618
00:25:26,109 --> 00:25:30,849
methods started popping up of people

619
00:25:28,089 --> 00:25:32,709
because people if you ever do yoga you

620
00:25:30,849 --> 00:25:34,959
will learn that what people love to do

621
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:37,150
is compensate and they love to lean and

622
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,250
they love to kind of take the easiest

623
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:43,390
path whatever it is they'll compensate

624
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:46,029
to get there and so those compensations

625
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:48,490
happened in water hash with fresh frozen

626
00:25:46,029 --> 00:25:50,589
and with micro planing when you use

627
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:53,558
fresh frozen you are using a wax

628
00:25:50,589 --> 00:25:55,750
membrane latent crystal head that is

629
00:25:53,558 --> 00:25:57,160
filled with moisture okay there's a lot

630
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:59,289
of moisture in there and you can see it

631
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:00,910
in the photos when you photograph fresh

632
00:25:59,289 --> 00:26:03,549
herb if you've seen mine it looks

633
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:05,650
beautiful like a like a full blown water

634
00:26:03,549 --> 00:26:07,279
balloon I just happen to have a

635
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:09,769
beautiful picture here in a frame

636
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:11,809
on my desktop so you see the quality

637
00:26:09,769 --> 00:26:14,029
there there you have sessile trichomes

638
00:26:11,809 --> 00:26:17,359
and capitate stocks capitate stock being

639
00:26:14,029 --> 00:26:19,460
the tall one and the low ones the small

640
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:21,079
ones being the sessile now if you look

641
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:24,259
closely on the tall one

642
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:26,119
you see these tiny tiny two little dots

643
00:26:24,259 --> 00:26:28,190
right here you might not be able to make

644
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:30,169
them out but what those are and they're

645
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:32,930
actually all over here I can tell

646
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:35,870
because they just it every little dot of

647
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:37,910
shining shimmery circle is one of them

648
00:26:35,869 --> 00:26:42,259
and these are male pollen this is one of

649
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:44,420
dr. Atomics breeding projects that he

650
00:26:42,259 --> 00:26:47,539
did this was a DJ short blue berry and I

651
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:49,789
believe he smacked it up with I want to

652
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:52,339
say one of his powerful powerful strong

653
00:26:49,789 --> 00:26:55,730
Northern Light men so I'm not sure

654
00:26:52,339 --> 00:26:57,859
whatever became of that but yeah these

655
00:26:55,730 --> 00:27:00,470
fresh frozen methods leaving the

656
00:26:57,859 --> 00:27:02,449
moisture content in the membrane a lot

657
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:04,039
of people nowadays just don't believe

658
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:06,640
you can even make full melt with dry

659
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:10,430
material because people are so far from

660
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:13,160
the tens the perfectly grown perfectly

661
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:14,840
you know terpene rich cultivars and I'm

662
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:17,779
not saying everyone don't get me wrong I

663
00:27:14,839 --> 00:27:20,149
see some beautiful bubble hash being

664
00:27:17,779 --> 00:27:22,430
posted on Instagram so shout out to all

665
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:25,250
of you guys and girls that are making it

666
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:27,560
happen it's great to see but I think

667
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:29,480
that the majority of people still aren't

668
00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:31,460
really learning that one of the aspects

669
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:33,529
of bubble bags is is that they can teach

670
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:35,750
you how to get better and if you ignore

671
00:27:33,529 --> 00:27:38,569
that lesson and you just start blasting

672
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:41,119
your [ __ ] and going down the oil path I

673
00:27:38,569 --> 00:27:42,980
think that you won't be as well off for

674
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:44,869
it you know not to say you can't do the

675
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:47,329
oil path as long as you're also still

676
00:27:44,869 --> 00:27:49,459
learning the best weed that I've ever

677
00:27:47,329 --> 00:27:51,829
seen that's a hard one I see a lot of

678
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:55,069
best weed if you can imagine you know

679
00:27:51,829 --> 00:27:59,149

00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:07,189
[ __ ] that you can see the the the the

683
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:09,170
texture from across the room when it's

684
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:10,910
sitting on your table I remember one

685
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:12,690
Gold Coast came out one time with some

686
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:15,840
really nice cookies they had on my

687
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:18,450
table in Amsterdam but also all sorts of

688
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:20,398
exotic Hayes's the moment bimba madness

pictures of it I really have an affinity

691
00:28:23,249 --> 00:28:28,288
for cannabis so I appreciate all aspects

692
00:28:26,098 --> 00:28:33,148
of it and I appreciate much more than

693
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:36,419
just one particular style if you can

694
00:28:33,148 --> 00:28:40,768

700
00:28:49,829 --> 00:28:53,728

gotten around we slay the trolls here

702

710
00:29:13,888 --> 00:29:19,108

711
00:29:17,098 --> 00:29:20,759
people in the room not quite to the

712
00:29:19,108 --> 00:29:23,608
level of hashed Church at this point in

713
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:25,618
time but hey it's a small group and I

714
00:29:23,608 --> 00:29:27,839
like it yeah we try to run a tight ship

715
00:29:25,618 --> 00:29:30,178

a bowl for the troll how about that you

717
00:29:30,179 --> 00:29:34,979
ever do cocaine you know I did cocaine

718
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:38,579
only a handful of times maybe even only

719
00:29:34,979 --> 00:29:40,879
no no I did it twice I remember I did it

720
00:29:38,579 --> 00:29:44,210
twice and both times I absolutely

721
00:29:40,878 --> 00:29:46,738
[ __ ] hated it I was quite young

722
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:48,358
definitely you know for my style of

723
00:29:46,739 --> 00:29:50,190
personality someone who's already going

724
00:29:48,358 --> 00:29:51,298
very fast and who processes information

725
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:53,849
quite quickly

726
00:29:51,298 --> 00:29:56,069
cocaine is no bueno for the bubble man

727
00:29:53,848 --> 00:29:58,019
and of course I was very young the one

728
00:29:56,069 --> 00:30:00,418
time I did it was also the same way as

729
00:29:58,019 --> 00:30:01,979
trying coffee which also didn't agree

730
00:30:00,419 --> 00:30:04,499
with me and [ __ ] me up and put me in

731
00:30:01,979 --> 00:30:06,749
the [ __ ] for an hour I just wanted to

732
00:30:04,499 --> 00:30:09,419
stay awake I was traveling across Canada

733
00:30:06,749 --> 00:30:12,028
all the way from Manitoba to BC and you

734
00:30:09,419 --> 00:30:14,190
know these [ __ ] degenerate i was with

735
00:30:12,028 --> 00:30:16,048
were like oh yeah try try a bumpin s

736
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:18,430
well let me tell you a bumper that was

737
00:30:16,048 --> 00:30:22,230
like the worst experience I ever had

738
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:24,220
so not good not a fun experience and

739
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:26,890
yeah I just can't do it

740
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:28,529
Oh surely your SIL you need to meet the

741
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:31,330
banhammer you want me to suck your balls

742
00:30:28,529 --> 00:30:33,849
how about I slam your balls into this

743
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:35,919
[ __ ] how about that

744
00:30:33,849 --> 00:30:37,569
all right did you could do no I don't

745
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:39,310
consume caffeine like I said the same

746
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:41,019
trip after having that horrible

747
00:30:39,309 --> 00:30:43,329
experience which lasted way longer than

748
00:30:41,019 --> 00:30:45,609
I wanted it to I ended up trying

749
00:30:43,329 --> 00:30:48,490
caffeine to stay awake I was really

750
00:30:45,609 --> 00:30:51,009
exhausted and I just I didn't want to

751
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:53,289
sleep and wake up dead in this vehicle

752
00:30:51,009 --> 00:30:55,269
cuz the guy driving was like maybe he

753
00:30:53,289 --> 00:30:57,009
shouldn't have been driving either way I

754
00:30:55,269 --> 00:30:58,930
tried the coffee and then that was even

755
00:30:57,009 --> 00:31:01,990
worse it was just you know I never did

756
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:04,750
try math I'm kind of glad because of the

757
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:06,789
cocaine experience I was like I was good

758
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:11,170
with psychedelics and cannabis from a

759
00:31:06,789 --> 00:31:14,829
young age never tried heroin no need to

760
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:17,820
try some of these more extreme drugs but

761
00:31:14,829 --> 00:31:21,069
I did I have to admit I did try cocaine

762
00:31:17,819 --> 00:31:24,339
I'm not proud of it I'm not proud of it

763
00:31:21,069 --> 00:31:25,629
I think that if more if most people were

764
00:31:24,339 --> 00:31:27,490
honest when you're younger that's the

765
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:29,320
thing about raising kids is kind of

766
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:30,970
scary that when you're younger and

767
00:31:29,319 --> 00:31:34,720
you're becoming who you're gonna become

768
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:37,990
you try things and so that as a parent

769
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:40,390
is of course the scariest thing I tried

770
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:43,720
opium one time as well and it was no

771
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:46,270
good no good for me as well I thought

772
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:49,329
that that was bad I said I did I did try

773
00:31:46,269 --> 00:31:51,549
opium it was it made me feel much like

774
00:31:49,329 --> 00:31:53,409
alcohol to be honest real Spinney in my

775
00:31:51,549 --> 00:31:55,389
head and I don't like alcohol either I

776
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:57,940
tried it a handful of times and just

777
00:31:55,390 --> 00:32:01,030
never liked it at all so I felt pretty

778
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:03,460
lucky to not have it in my life all

779
00:32:01,029 --> 00:32:06,279
these years yeah shrooms for the wind

780
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:08,860
probably one of my most how does harmala

781
00:32:06,279 --> 00:32:12,460
affect a mushroom trip well its Harmelin

782
00:32:08,859 --> 00:32:16,179
and harmine they're two components that

783
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:19,029
sort of potentiate the tert the trick to

784
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:23,289
mean hi Terence Mckenna talks about it a

785
00:32:19,029 --> 00:32:26,349
little bit in I think it was archaic

786
00:32:23,289 --> 00:32:28,210
revival now may be true that no archaic

787
00:32:26,349 --> 00:32:29,919
revival it was about his brother they

788
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:33,069
did this crazy to

789
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:34,539
it's basically like you know tryptamine

790
00:32:33,069 --> 00:32:37,779
can be a very short trip

791
00:32:34,539 --> 00:32:39,549
you can intensify it with the harming

792
00:32:37,779 --> 00:32:42,730
and the Harmelin you got to Google these

793
00:32:39,549 --> 00:32:45,190
companies and you probably find out a

794
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:47,259
lot more information than what I

795
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:53,890
currently know but it's definitely

796
00:32:47,259 --> 00:32:57,039
interesting oh really I will smoke you

797
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:59,020

00:32:59,019 --> 00:33:09,579
stomach yeah no [ __ ] all right are we

800
00:33:05,019 --> 00:33:10,480
hitting again hey Bubba man I have to

801
00:33:09,579 --> 00:33:12,299
ask you what's your opinion about

802
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:16,329
extraterrestrials and if you ever minute

803
00:33:12,299 --> 00:33:19,629
unacknowledged unacknowledged what does

804
00:33:16,329 --> 00:33:21,789
that mean by dr. Steven Greer the name

805
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:24,460
sounds so familiar I don't think I have

806
00:33:21,789 --> 00:33:27,420
been unacknowledged by Steven Greer my

807
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:29,319
and what do I think about

808
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:30,940
extraterrestrials that's a good one you

809
00:33:29,319 --> 00:33:33,279
know that's a pretty good one because I

810
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:35,019
will say that I was I read all the crazy

811
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:38,200
conspiracy books back in the day from

812
00:33:35,019 --> 00:33:39,879
Robert Anton Wilson led me into Terrence

813
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:42,460
and all the psychedelic visionaries but

814
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:45,010
then I kind of got into David Icke who

815
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:49,269
was just out there completely and I read

816
00:33:45,009 --> 00:33:51,129
like Graham Hancock and I read what's

817
00:33:49,269 --> 00:33:53,289
the other guy draw all all of it like

818
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:57,000
from all the little walks from like

819
00:33:53,289 --> 00:33:59,680
about you know Enki and Enlil and oh oh

820
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:02,079
zecharia sitchin the 12th planet series

821
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:05,259
which I felt was just a really enjoyable

822
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:08,590
book whether it was true or not the

823
00:34:05,259 --> 00:34:10,570
stories were incredible and they sort of

824
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:13,690
resonated with me that there was this

825
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:16,419
potential of a planet on an elliptical

826
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:18,610
orbit with our planet that you know came

827
00:34:16,418 --> 00:34:20,079
here to mine gold for their planet

828
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:22,269
because they [ __ ] their [ __ ] up with

829
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:25,599
their technology pretty interesting

830
00:34:22,269 --> 00:34:27,668
story written on Sumerian you know multi

831
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:29,648
thousand ten and fifteen and twenty

832
00:34:27,668 --> 00:34:32,079
thousand year old stone tablets found

833
00:34:29,648 --> 00:34:33,759
all over the world and I found it

834
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:35,889
interesting I try not to really grasp

835
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,630
and believe anything fervently these

836
00:34:35,889 --> 00:34:39,549
days other than cannabis truths and

837
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:41,260
knowledge otherwise I just I'm always

838
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:43,419
afraid of people like that that just

839
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:45,399
that they believe what they

840
00:34:43,418 --> 00:34:47,588
so fervently that's why it's so easy to

841
00:34:45,398 --> 00:34:49,058
laugh at the flat earthers and not just

842
00:34:47,588 --> 00:34:51,369
the flat earthers but also the people

843
00:34:49,059 --> 00:34:52,778
who argue with them and say no no no the

844
00:34:51,369 --> 00:34:55,419
world is round

845
00:34:52,778 --> 00:34:57,579
I have no card in the game but it just

846
00:34:55,418 --> 00:34:59,170
sounds so ridiculous that it's allowed

847
00:34:57,579 --> 00:35:01,329
me to be a little more open with my

848
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:02,829
belief system but yeah sakuradite

849
00:35:01,329 --> 00:35:07,150
Sitchin had some pretty good information

850
00:35:02,829 --> 00:35:08,798
about you know and it sort of kind of

851
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:11,559
combines and resonates with me in the

852
00:35:08,798 --> 00:35:14,230
sense that you know we seem like we're

853
00:35:11,559 --> 00:35:16,119
these different versions of the apes

854
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:18,219
that are naturally here and in the story

855
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:20,079
of course they took the ape DNA and put

856
00:35:18,219 --> 00:35:22,358
it into their DNA and created they're

857
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:25,809
their servants which were humans and

858
00:35:22,358 --> 00:35:28,568
then the story goes that the Apple of

859
00:35:25,809 --> 00:35:32,109
knowledge the Adam and Eve story which

860
00:35:28,568 --> 00:35:33,940
this predates by like 8,000 years which

861
00:35:32,108 --> 00:35:35,949
it predates all the religious textures

862
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:37,690
by many many thousands of years which is

863
00:35:35,949 --> 00:35:39,368
unique because all of the religious

864
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:41,200
stories repeat themselves and when you

865
00:35:39,369 --> 00:35:43,778
know that these stories were even older

866
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:46,058
and they're slightly different it's

867
00:35:43,778 --> 00:35:47,980
pretty cool but you know does it change

868
00:35:46,059 --> 00:35:50,319
my day to day life do I go around trying

869
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:52,179
to convince people yeah possibly I see

870
00:35:50,318 --> 00:35:53,739
that there's a dichotomy in the human

871
00:35:52,179 --> 00:35:56,199
beings on this planet that some of us

872
00:35:53,739 --> 00:35:57,699
want to just hang out by the bonfire and

873
00:35:56,199 --> 00:36:00,278
live in a teepee and smoke the peace

874
00:35:57,699 --> 00:36:02,828
pipe and then others want to build metal

875
00:36:00,278 --> 00:36:05,528
spaceships and fly to other planets it

876
00:36:02,829 --> 00:36:09,309
seems like we have a little bit of both

877
00:36:05,528 --> 00:36:14,259
going on there so who thinks satellites

878
00:36:09,309 --> 00:36:17,259
and dinosaurs are fake yeah I try open

879
00:36:14,259 --> 00:36:19,059
morning FATA mike korean natural farming

880
00:36:17,259 --> 00:36:20,409
can repair the world and grow our full

881
00:36:19,059 --> 00:36:23,559
melt hash for pennies on the ground well

882
00:36:20,409 --> 00:36:26,288
that's my [ __ ] gig I want to grow

883
00:36:23,559 --> 00:36:28,869
hash for pennies on the ground you know

884
00:36:26,289 --> 00:36:31,630
who thinks dams are real I agree bubble

885
00:36:28,869 --> 00:36:33,910
man yeah you know go with it on your own

886
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:36,519
try not to believe blindly in anything

887
00:36:33,909 --> 00:36:40,568
you know particularly the opposite of

888
00:36:36,518 --> 00:36:43,298
what you believe yeah John Dover I have

889
00:36:40,568 --> 00:36:44,889
a few of them on my on my Facebook but

890
00:36:43,298 --> 00:36:47,170
you know what I have to say I laughs

891
00:36:44,889 --> 00:36:49,420
equally at the people who argue with

892
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:52,059
them because the funny thing is they

893
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:52,519
start talking about math oh I know math

894
00:36:52,059 --> 00:36:54,050
that

895
00:36:52,519 --> 00:36:55,699
prove it it's like the bottom line is

896
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:59,360
this have you been outside of the earth

897
00:36:55,699 --> 00:37:01,219
and looked at it the answer is no so

898
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:03,200
then that's why I laugh at everyone you

899
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:04,849
know using using other people's

900
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:07,879
information that could easily be

901
00:37:04,849 --> 00:37:09,650
manipulated as proof to the other person

902
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:11,480
why you're right and they're wrong it's

903
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:14,210
just seriously the most ridiculous thing

904
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:17,990
ever so I think it's time for another

905
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:20,059
dab what do we say anyone in here use

906
00:37:17,989 --> 00:37:22,309
ativan no Mike Michael's out stay the

907
00:37:20,059 --> 00:37:25,670
[ __ ] away from that stuff it turned my

908
00:37:22,309 --> 00:37:27,380
friend into a zombie really and you know

909
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:30,250
for those people that say it works okay

910
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:33,650
I'm sorry but I worry about using

911
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:36,369
pharmaceutical drugs to regulate your

912
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:42,800
anxiety or how you feel that's a very

913
00:37:36,369 --> 00:37:46,069
dangerous dangerous game what friend you

914
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:48,350
wouldn't know him it was a long time ago

915
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:49,990
now but he was the most normal of people

916
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:52,639
and I'm telling you that ativan

917
00:37:49,989 --> 00:37:56,089
completely changed his personality he

918
00:37:52,639 --> 00:38:04,420
became really aggressive really really

919
00:37:56,090 --> 00:38:04,420
aggressive don't do it that's what I say

920
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:15,900
good for you Larry what do you think

921
00:38:13,889 --> 00:38:18,960
about alchemy and hermetics bubbleman

922
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:20,610
well what little I know about it I think

923
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:32,460
it's quite interesting I love the

924
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:34,349
concept of alchemy and often tell people

925
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:36,420
that's what bubble hash was maybe like

926
00:38:34,349 --> 00:38:49,019
this is science I'd be like it's

927
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:50,130
actually a little bit more alchemy yeah

928
00:38:49,019 --> 00:38:51,719
there's just got to be better ways to

929
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:54,510
deal with these anxieties I think it's

930
00:38:51,719 --> 00:38:57,480
very important that we find them because

931
00:38:54,510 --> 00:39:01,560
these pills that mimic you know and and

932
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:06,420
try to regulate these feelings and then

933
00:39:01,559 --> 00:39:10,829
coincidentally have side effects that

934
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:13,110
are suicidal thoughts these these that's

935
00:39:10,829 --> 00:39:16,829
not good to go from a little bit anxious

936
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:19,800
or even a lot anxious right to suicidal

937
00:39:16,829 --> 00:39:21,630
thoughts that's something that I think

938
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:23,850
we should be looking at in our society

939
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:26,280
you know we're not allowed to smoke

940
00:39:23,849 --> 00:39:28,079
cannabis and drive a vehicle but

941
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:31,170
potentially the person who's driving the

942
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:33,569
school bus that your kid sits on is able

943
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:36,780
to take an extra a divan if he or she so

944
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:37,980
chooses it's kind of freaky I'm not

945
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:40,019
saying they shouldn't be allowed I'm

946
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:43,139
just saying maybe I'd like to know so I

947
00:39:40,019 --> 00:39:44,550
could make the decision you know rather

948
00:39:43,139 --> 00:39:46,289
than just I'm not all about trying to

949
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:48,870
make everyone not be able to do anything

950
00:39:46,289 --> 00:39:51,269
that's not my intention here the jazz

951
00:39:48,869 --> 00:39:55,859
dissolving off yeah just cleaning the

952
00:39:51,269 --> 00:39:59,969
Chas Chas and Chas and cleaning the Chas

953
00:39:55,860 --> 00:40:01,650
and it's good to get it clean yeah I

954
00:39:59,969 --> 00:40:12,480
wish we could share photos on here too

955
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:16,860
that would be kind of a nice thing yeah

956
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:18,159
yeah I can I can that I don't have to be

957
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:20,990
for tomorrow though

958
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:24,079
let's see what we got Chaz prevention is

959
00:40:20,989 --> 00:40:25,639

Bangor or chazzy bangers on Instagram

962
00:40:28,489 --> 00:40:31,669
it's almost too hard to believe it's

963
00:40:30,409 --> 00:40:33,259
almost like looking at a car accident

964
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:36,800
you just can't stop watching as you

965

972
00:40:56,570 --> 00:41:00,080
memory when it comes to that [ __ ] so

973
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,750
when I saw the other day and hashed

974
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:05,150
heard someone say FSS I was like ah

975
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:07,460
there it is I get it

976
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:09,050
hope you're doing well anyway brother it

977
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:10,789
was nice talking with you the other day

978
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:13,430
and talking to you right now

979
00:41:10,789 --> 00:41:14,029
say hi to your wife Katie for me Katie's

980
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:16,369
a sweetie

981
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:17,780
doing the good job loving her husband

982
00:41:16,369 --> 00:41:19,789
it's nice when our partners can take

983
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:22,670
care of us like that and just step out a

984
00:41:19,789 --> 00:41:24,320
little bit to do something special those

985
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:27,170
are the important things those are the

986
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:28,519
signs of true love but you know someone

987
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:33,920
loves you when they go out of their way

988
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:36,590
to just shoot an arrow out Griffin will

989
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:40,909
someone explain to me what is this I

990
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:42,740
guess that depends on what this you're

991
00:41:40,909 --> 00:41:44,569
referring to are you holding something

992
00:41:42,739 --> 00:41:46,159
in your hand that we can't see are you

993
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:50,000
referring to this live chat that

994
00:41:46,159 --> 00:41:52,339
currently were all-in what what what

995
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,929
yeah cuz this is just a chat this is

996
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:55,840
kind of a like trying to get you going

997
00:41:53,929 --> 00:41:58,489
on the day maybe a little bit of

998
00:41:55,840 --> 00:42:00,829
inspiration while we puff a few bowls

999
00:41:58,489 --> 00:42:02,449
you know we're all cannabis aficionados

1000
00:42:00,829 --> 00:42:04,250
here so we're promoting the

1001
00:42:02,449 --> 00:42:06,109
endocannabinoid system which is of

1002
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:09,829
course a system that uses cannabinoids

1003
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:11,599
which cannabis is ripe with to regulate

1004
00:42:09,829 --> 00:42:13,009
our biological functions from the first

1005
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:15,380
breath to the last breath that we take

1006
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:18,740
basically our entire lives all of our

1007
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:20,180
biological functions so this is kind of

1008
00:42:18,739 --> 00:42:22,099
what we talked about it used to it

1009
00:42:20,179 --> 00:42:24,139
started out as oh we're all smoking weed

1010
00:42:22,099 --> 00:42:27,319
and it's illegal and then we learned

1011
00:42:24,139 --> 00:42:29,389
that it actually regulates our

1012
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:30,080
biological functions and can keep a lot

1013
00:42:29,389 --> 00:42:32,389
of disease

1014
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:35,809
sickness out of our lives if we just

1015
00:42:32,389 --> 00:42:38,029
prevent it by staying in homeostasis and

1016
00:42:35,809 --> 00:42:40,219
what homeostasis is think of the

1017
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:43,130
endocannabinoids system as the crank on

1018
00:42:40,219 --> 00:42:44,869
your bicycle and each pedal one is the

1019
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:46,849
immune system and one is the central

1020
00:42:44,869 --> 00:42:48,589
nervous system when all the ball

1021
00:42:46,849 --> 00:42:49,610
bearings and the grease is all working

1022
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:51,950
perfectly

1023
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:54,740
you have homeostasis and what that does

1024
00:42:51,949 --> 00:42:56,960
in the body obviously is it feels good

1025
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:58,759
you feel good when you're in homeostasis

1026
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,889
and you're healthy you go to the

1027
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:03,950
bathroom regularly you sleep well you

1028
00:43:00,889 --> 00:43:08,170
have a good memory your appetite is

1029
00:43:03,949 --> 00:43:11,439
healthy all of these things stay

1030
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:14,329
regulated when you are preventing

1031
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:16,579
endocannabinoid deficiency by consuming

1032
00:43:14,329 --> 00:43:18,219
cannabinoids now if cannabis isn't your

1033
00:43:16,579 --> 00:43:20,269
bag don't worry you can produce these

1034
00:43:18,219 --> 00:43:23,419
endogenously in your body which also

1035
00:43:20,269 --> 00:43:25,190
tells us how important they are not only

1036
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:27,320
endogenously through the consumption of

1037
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:29,269
essential amino acids which you can get

1038
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:32,210
through hemp seed once again thank you

1039
00:43:29,269 --> 00:43:34,489
cannabis or different things like salmon

1040
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:38,150
and different fish that have fatty acids

1041
00:43:34,489 --> 00:43:41,359
in them gl na s and GLA s they're all

1042
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:43,550
there for our consumption and our

1043
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:46,220
enjoyment and then one more thing to lay

1044
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:48,920
on you when we start our life if you can

1045
00:43:46,219 --> 00:43:50,689
imagine that the the negative

1046
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:52,280
stereotypes against cannabis like oh

1047
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:54,079
look at that guy's got puffy red eyes

1048
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:56,210
he's all stoned or look at them they got

1049
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:58,369
the munchies well those actually flip in

1050
00:43:56,210 --> 00:44:00,679
the medical world puffy red eyes he's

1051
00:43:58,369 --> 00:44:02,269
stoned equals granny's not going to lose

1052
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:04,839
her sight because she's able to reduce

1053
00:44:02,269 --> 00:44:07,309
her ocular pressure with cannabinoids

1054
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:11,480
stimulating one's appetite may look

1055
00:44:07,309 --> 00:44:15,259
funny to the stoner stereotype looking

1056
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:17,630
out at it but in reality stimulating an

1057
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:18,860
appetite of one suffering from wasting

1058
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:21,170
syndrome from some of the AIDS

1059
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:24,050
medications or when one is starting

1060
00:44:21,170 --> 00:44:26,480
one's life and suckling on the nipple of

1061
00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:28,250
your mother the breast milk is ripe with

1062
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:30,559
cannabinoids these cannabinoids are

1063
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:32,750
inducing appetite and the the initial

1064
00:44:30,559 --> 00:44:37,789
latching of the baby to the breast is

1065
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:40,320
the is the absolute stereotype of the

1066
00:44:37,789 --> 00:44:43,079
munchies that's how all life on Earth is

1067
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:45,690
sustained cannabinoids produce and

1068
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:49,980
regulate biological functions so there

1069
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:51,360
it is from me to you that's what this is

1070
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:54,659
I think that was a pretty good little

1071
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:56,789
drop I'm gonna let you guys go because

1072
00:44:54,659 --> 00:44:58,619
I've been babbling on for probably a lot

1073
00:44:56,789 --> 00:44:58,920
longer Oh Thank You Griffin right on

1074
00:44:58,619 --> 00:45:00,989
brother

1075
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:02,940
we will appreciate having you here dude

1076
00:45:00,989 --> 00:45:04,259
this has good information that you can

1077
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:06,389
share with people that might still be

1078
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:08,640
locked away into the propaganda based

1079
00:45:06,389 --> 00:45:11,429
prohibition based mentality of cannabis

1080
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:12,960
that is showing them that they still see

1081
00:45:11,429 --> 00:45:14,609
the negative stereotypes and you might

1082
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:16,590
need to flip the coin for a few of those

1083
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:18,300
people and I think it'll be easier for

1084
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:20,130
you to flip that coin if you have some

1085
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:22,650
of this knowledge that I just shared I

1086
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:24,869
do this six days a week and then on the

1087
00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:26,930
seventh day it's kind of a steroid

1088
00:45:24,869 --> 00:45:29,819
version where I invite a panel of

1089
00:45:26,929 --> 00:45:32,399
amazing cannabis aficionados to come and

1090
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:37,320
share their information with all of you

1091
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:38,880
so yeah be men very locked away so many

1092
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:40,769
don't care it's true trichome City

1093
