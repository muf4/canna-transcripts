1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:07,119
Quick question in regard to that Sam. In

2
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:10,279
regards to when did you guys come across

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:14,280
tarpen as a modulator to can to the

4
00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:14,279
canabonoid profile?

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:23,000
Uh well about

6
00:00:17,239 --> 00:00:28,479
2000 Rob and I well I obtained some pure

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:32,640
THC 100% pure and uh what we did was we

8
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:36,600
vaporized 25 THCA.

9
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,280
Yeah, it was THCA. But thank you. We we

10
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:44,799
vaporized

11
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:49,120
uh 25 uh milligrams each in a volcano on

12
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:51,359
one of those little uh they're like a

13
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:55,359
little stainless steel brillo pad. Those

14
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:58,079
little pads that they have. Okay. So, we

15
00:00:55,359 --> 00:01:01,198
were blown away because I mean, if you

16
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,000
smoke 25 milligrams of hash or 25

17
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:06,560
milligrams

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,560
of you you you get stoned and you it's

19
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:13,040
pretty good. But with this, it the most

20
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,400
describable thing about it was that it

21
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:19,600
had no individuality whatsoever like

22
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:23,359
cannabis products do. It was really

23
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:26,158
flat, one-dimensional, kind of boring.

24
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:28,478
Uh Rob, I think at the time actually

25
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,759
said, "If this is all there is to

26
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:34,438
cannabis, I wouldn't be a smoker." Yeah.

27
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,759
If this is what you got turned on to in

28
00:01:34,438 --> 00:01:39,118
uh high school or

29
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:40,478
whatever, instead of the real thing, you

30
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:41,920
I don't think any of us would have

31
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:44,159
really been interested. It's sort of

32
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,159
like

33
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,680
uh being a fan of Everclear, you know,

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,280
the

35
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:54,640
the 180 something app proof um liquor

36
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,879
you can get in Nevada. It's not even

37
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,040
legal in the state of California. But

38
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:01,280
it's ethanol essentially and nobody

39
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,040
drinks it straight. I mean, you nobody

40
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,239
just dilutes it with water and drinks it

41
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:08,159
because they like it. It's uh it's a

42
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:12,639
novelty. THC was the same thing. It's it

43
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:17,359
had no color at all. So later that day,

44
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:22,519
what we did was we uh mixed it with a

45
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:26,879
little bit of uh 50% dry sip skunk

46
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:31,920
resin. And what that allowed was uh to

47
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:35,039
create a material that was 75% THC, so

48
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:37,919
less than 100%. But it was also tarpin

49
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:39,919
rich from the resin from the dry sip.

50
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:43,280
When we smoked that, the effects were

51
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:46,318
twice as strong as a pure THC. And uh a

52
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:49,120
light went in in our heads because from

53
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:52,839
the early 70s, both Robert and I, even

54
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:56,480
before we met, had felt that

55
00:02:52,840 --> 00:03:00,800
tarpen might well contribute to the

56
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:03,479
synergistic effects found in cannabis.

57
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:07,519
I think one of the primary reasons was

58
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:11,119
because haze when it was tested for its

59
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:14,239
THC level was to be, you know, in the

60
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:17,239
high end of cannabis, but when you

61
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:20,200
smoked it, it was in the outer space of

62
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:23,039
cannabis. I mean, it was really really

63
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:25,679
active and uh I think that was because

64
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:28,878
of the tarpen. I I think that's how you

65
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,480
felt. Well, the the other amazing thing

66
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:32,959
in the

67
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:34,798
early 70s was that people started

68
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,039
growing cannabis. You know, they started

69
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:40,799
growing senia and that's when you really

70
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:44,239
noticed what the difference was between

71
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:46,439
fresh homegrown and what imported weed

72
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:50,039
of whatever kind you ever got

73
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:52,878
before. What that was, you know, it was

74
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:55,759
it that was a profound difference, you

75
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:57,438
know, just to see something fresh, you

76
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:59,840
know, the way mother nature gives it to

77
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:03,840
you. the essence of most of the weed

78
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:07,039
that you smoked back in the 70s, a

79
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:10,080
moldy, musty essence, you know? I mean,

80
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:13,438
I remember my first bag of weed, 1974,

81
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:16,639
it was it was moldy. Now that I I think

82
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:19,759
about it, it it certainly was mold. I

83
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,439
think most mo most of what I think most

84
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,520
of what Robert and I got, even though it

85
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:25,199
was imported, it was not moldy. Or if it

86
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:27,519
was, it was very very very very

87
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,840
slightly. Yeah. But a lot of trying to

88
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:32,319
make a lot of ways though a general

89
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:34,918
statement that most of commercial weed

90
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:38,639
at the time essentially which came from

91
00:04:34,918 --> 00:04:40,478
Mexico was probably uh fouled with with

92
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,478
mold and all kinds of different

93
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:43,918
microbes. If you look very hard, you

94
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:45,758
would have found things for sure. And

95
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:48,079
some of it, of course, is unsmokable as

96
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:51,520
you know. Just plain it was just plain

97
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:55,120
ry. Yeah. But uh young kid on dead tour

98
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:57,198
in the mid70s by 1980 I was hooked up.

99
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,800
Yeah. Yeah. Well, meanwhile, back to

100
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:03,840
tarpine. So, we we smoked the pure THC.

101
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:07,038
We rise. This ain't it. We smoked THC

102
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:10,638
mixed with resin 50/50, which made 75%

103
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:13,199
THC by dry weight. And wow, that that

104
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:16,400
was very interesting. So then what we

105
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:19,840
did a year or two later, we obtained all

106
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:21,799
the canabonoids. So all the top 10

107
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:27,359
canabonoids THC,

108
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:31,000
CBD, CBG, THCV etc etc. And we also

109
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:33,360
obtained the top 10

110
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,478
turppins. And then we were able to try

111
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,639
the different canabonoids. And we found

112
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:43,120
out that a couple of interesting things

113
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:45,120
like number one if you smoke pure CBD in

114
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,840
a fairly large amount, a tenth of a

115
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,800
gram, 100 milligrams.

116
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:54,560
Then what happens is it blocks the

117
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:56,600
activity of even the strongest dry sit

118
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,519
for about 8 to 12

119
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:02,400
hours. So that was interesting. The

120
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:05,680
other interesting thing was that THCB is

121
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:07,638
not psychoactive at all. The because a

122
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,400
lot of people at that time believed it

123
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:12,199
was. Then we tried all the different

124
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:16,399
tarpen with

125
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:19,919
THC. Uh so we tried 25 milligrams of THC

126
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:22,318
all double blinded with one tarpine you

127
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:25,198
know as tiny amount as we could put it

128
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:27,680
with it and what we found out was that

129
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:30,960
meine boline

130
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:34,959
uh tinine and a few other definitely

131
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:38,000
potentiated THC and most of the others

132
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:40,799
or a lot of the others also modulated

133
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,439
THC to different uh levels. So, some

134
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:46,400
made you couch locked, some made you uh

135
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:49,360
speedy, and it was like a revelation. I

136
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:51,918
mean, we had suspected it, but we never

137
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,240
never really dreamed it would be that

138
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:56,560
clear because we did it with 12

139
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,519
different double blinded test subjects

140
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:02,319
with a 100 question survey before and

141
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:04,079
after, and we all agreed on the same

142
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,560
things.

143
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:11,839
different people preferred the couch

144
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:14,240
lock or the uh uh the uplifting but they

145
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:20,638
all agreed that that particular compound

146
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:22,639
with THC had that effect. So yeah it so

147
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:25,439
this was all you know maybe 12 years ago

148
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:28,800
or 13 years ago although we started it

149
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:32,399
practically 15 years ago and it's uh

150
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:34,160
yeah it's it's not at first I was afraid

151
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:36,000
to release the information because I

152
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,080
thought people would start coming out

153
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,240
with

154
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:46,399
uh Skunky Sam's improve your weed spray,

155
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:48,879
turn mold to gold. And they have to a

156
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:50,638
certain degree, but what the better side

157
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:53,360
of it is when people are extracting

158
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,598
tarpen from the natural cannabis sources

159
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,919
and then adding them back to the same.

160
00:07:55,598 --> 00:08:00,159
That's that's pretty benign as long as

161
00:07:57,918 --> 00:08:03,598
no chemicals and solvents are being left

162
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:06,240
or Yeah. I I don't know what to say, but

163
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:08,878
the truth of it is it's changed cannabis

164
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:12,120
and our understanding will continue to

165
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:14,400
learn, but it's a really big step

166
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,879
forward. What I'd really like to see

167
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:18,239
done is is

168
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:20,360
uh something much more sophisticated

169
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:24,160
than we were able to do, you know, and

170
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:27,520
and see see science put to bear on this

171
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:29,199
situation and see what we can learn

172
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:31,519
about different tarpine combinations

173
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:33,839
with different canabonoids. Oops.

174
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:36,879
There's 140 of them. Seems the most

175
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,959
interesting uh avenue for me at the

176
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:42,320
moment.

177
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:44,479
That's 140 known, right? That's just

178
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,480
what we know so far. Yeah. And some of

179
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,080
them are really in trace amounts and

180
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:52,399
that doesn't mean they're not important.

181
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:55,440
That but uh yeah, about 20 of them make

182
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:57,519
up most of the turppines in in uh

183
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,360
cannabis we smoke today. But there's a

184
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,278
smattering of other other compounds and

185
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,519
they could be key also. So yeah, there

186
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:06,080
could be a couple hundred tarpen. We

187
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:08,560
just haven't IDed them yet. Yeah. But

188
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:12,080
the smaller the amounts, the less

189
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:15,399
significant they are likely to be just

190
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,399
by odds.

191
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:22,399
There's probably also heavy selective

192
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:24,159
uh pressures involved recently, you

193
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:28,278
know, in the way of people breeding. I

194
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:30,120
mean, there's there's aromomas people

195
00:09:28,278 --> 00:09:33,360
like and

196
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:36,000
there's effects they expect based on

197
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,680
that aroma. It's this feedback loop

198
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,320
thing that makes it all kind of hard to

199
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:42,559
study in a more detailed way. And and

200
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,640
it's and it's it's

201
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:46,000
[Music]

202
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:49,759
uh it's important and those things are

203
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,120
somehow related, but they're not as rel

204
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:52,958
related in the way I would have thought

205
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:56,159
in a biochemical sort of way. They're

206
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:57,838
more related in in what we individually

207
00:09:56,159 --> 00:10:00,559
make of each variety and our

208
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,560
relationship with it. It's gets I know

209
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:03,879
I'm sounding a bit cosmic for the

210
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:06,879
scientist guy,

211
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:09,200
but it's impossible to separate one from

212
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:12,879
the other. I'm not even sure exactly how

213
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:15,040
you would do a a statistically rigorous

214
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:18,078
test of the tarpine and and can and

215
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:19,679
canabonoid data. It'd be interesting for

216
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:21,759
somebody to set it up. There's a lot

217
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:24,319
more powerful tools now that we uh have

218
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:26,159
had They are biochemically related.

219
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,839
There's no question about it. Of course,

220
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:30,399
but of course, but that's not the only

221
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,680
relationship is what I'd say, right? I

222
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,440
mean, I've always wondered if they're

223
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:35,759
competing pathways. I mean, they use the

224
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,519
same precursors. So, what exactly is

225
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:40,600
going on? Hard to say, but we've

226
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:43,360
certainly jacked up both pathways and

227
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:46,879
modern varieties. I mean, these these

228
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:49,600
hybrids are uh big producers of all of

229
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:52,159
the above. Yeah. It's not like there's a

230
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,920
shortage of one thing or another. they

231
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:57,519
the turppines seem to have become sort

232
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:59,838
of a mishmash and uh it's more now what

233
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:03,200
what plants don't have rather than what

234
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:07,200
they have in my mind that's sort of that

235
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,800
uh what makes a a variety and that's

236
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,320
characteristic in the way it smells to

237
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:14,240
me is a key tarpine it has or a couple

238
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,680
of them but also all the turppins that

239
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,399
it's lacking so that it doesn't smell

240
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:22,159
like everything else.

241
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,159
It's pretty uh inbred at this
