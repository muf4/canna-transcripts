00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:33,420
bake here in Kingston Jamaica I have no

51
00:02:31,889 --> 00:02:35,819
real idea what's going on today I think

52
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:38,399
there might be a Kabakov pyramid later

53
00:02:35,818 --> 00:02:41,968
Kabakov pyramid show along with marcia

54
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,250
griffin and some others at the Randy

55
00:02:41,968 --> 00:02:45,930
Williams Center so I'm pretty excited

56
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,908
about the opportunity to get it over

57
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:50,849
there hopefully Tony's going to join me

58
00:02:47,908 --> 00:02:52,438
and who knows perhaps Tony Tony will

59
00:02:50,848 --> 00:02:55,078
come out and join me for a little bit of

60
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:57,449
a wake and bake puff here I'm gonna have

61
00:02:55,079 --> 00:03:05,120
one more little hit Lemmon death pie

62
00:02:57,449 --> 00:03:05,119

63
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,760
all right eleven week and baking in

64
00:03:12,509 --> 00:03:16,409
Jamaica it's one of the rare times that

65
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:19,829
I'm actually in the room alone we

66
00:03:16,409 --> 00:03:21,659
usually have a dozen people or more so I

67
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:23,760
thought I'd start this puff Wednesday

68
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:25,409
out by literally even if we don't go

69
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:28,229
anywhere in the least what I'll do is

70
00:03:25,409 --> 00:03:30,389
I'll just share everyone's first puff

71
00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:31,469
that they come into the room for it like

72
00:03:30,389 --> 00:03:33,089
I said hopefully we get over to

73
00:03:31,469 --> 00:03:34,229
emancipation apartment the camera and we

74
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:36,240
can talk to some of the people that are

75
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:37,919
just walking through the park get their

76
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,870
opinions on what they think the gun to

77
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:41,280
laws here in Jamaica and whether or not

78
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:44,310
it's time to change the whether or not

79
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:49,459
they're embracing this opportunity for

80
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:49,459
Jamaica so all right here we go death by

81
00:04:04,669 --> 00:04:07,859
[Music]

82
00:04:09,229 --> 00:04:15,789
yeah that's the stuff it's gonna be a

83
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:19,220
good puff winds they keep watching I

84
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:22,550
guess this is Wednesday bubble man said

85
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:26,150
that I have taken full meltdown first

86
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:32,000
thing in the morning so I I'm gonna try

87
00:04:26,149 --> 00:04:34,129
out this news silicon carbide now yes

88
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,019
they tried it out for the last couple

89
00:04:34,129 --> 00:04:40,069
days and I you know I actually kind of

90
00:04:36,019 --> 00:04:42,379
like it it's better than it's better

91
00:04:40,069 --> 00:04:45,978
than definitely better than titanium

92
00:04:42,379 --> 00:04:48,529
I haven't had I haven't had really a lot

93
00:04:45,978 --> 00:04:50,060
of time to mess with temperatures and

94
00:04:48,529 --> 00:04:54,500
things like that and compared to course

95
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:56,560
but one thing is it's got a very even

96
00:04:54,500 --> 00:05:00,649
distribution in the way the heat

97
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:02,329
vaporized the full melt and it was

98
00:05:00,649 --> 00:05:04,579
really easy to clean and it hasn't

99
00:05:02,329 --> 00:05:06,168
unbelievable taste I think these are

100
00:05:04,579 --> 00:05:08,439
probably gonna end different place and

101
00:05:06,168 --> 00:05:12,649
all the titanium that you see out there

102
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:15,350
but yeah we've had a couple puffs

103
00:05:12,649 --> 00:05:15,979
Wednesday you might see I see a couple

104
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:18,980

different parties to go to a bank and i

109
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:34,759

[Music]

122
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:44,218
it's why they call puff Wednesday to

123
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:46,079
thumbs up for to tears down well hey

124

125
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:51,228
world knocking keeps Jamaican came

126
00:06:48,088 --> 00:06:51,228
Jamaica ready to do it

127
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,860
[Music]

128
00:07:11,928 --> 00:07:16,468
because it warms up so I'm gonna hold

129
00:07:14,189 --> 00:07:19,019
control he's gonna melt it a little bit

130
00:07:16,468 --> 00:07:21,418
first if they went to go I'll tell you

131
00:07:19,019 --> 00:07:28,189
mine you'll see it's gonna turn or die

132
00:07:21,418 --> 00:07:28,188
and it's Wednesday it is you think oh

133
00:07:28,218 --> 00:07:34,079
and it's worth one is this

134
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:36,360
just getting it warmed up a little bit

135
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:38,789
so the wax it plays away yeah it just

136
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:43,040
kind of heats it up into a more liquidy

137
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:43,040
state and then you ready

138
00:08:00,158 --> 00:08:19,808
taking a trip on the mothership it's

139
00:08:18,009 --> 00:08:22,629
just telling heavy a little bit about

140
00:08:19,809 --> 00:08:24,849
the prana line so what that does is make

141
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:28,349
categories so instead of saying one

142
00:08:24,848 --> 00:08:31,658
string to help you catalogs strange

143
00:08:28,348 --> 00:08:35,379
groups so this one would be sativas that

144
00:08:31,658 --> 00:08:48,740
rth seems TLC eight yeah this one is

145
00:08:35,379 --> 00:08:52,100
high CBD yeah that's like CBD the THC

146
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:54,889
remember pureplant profiles so it's like

147
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:58,670
taking cold pressed oil so it's a rock

148
00:08:54,889 --> 00:08:59,419
is raw concentrated forms of plant

149
00:08:58,669 --> 00:09:01,939
cannabinoids

150
00:08:59,419 --> 00:09:05,829
terpenes and everything

151
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:08,830
all right and then this ones

152
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:10,690
she became CBN is there one he should

153
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:12,820
hit before a dab or just after death

154
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:16,390
this right here is the p1 it's been

155
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:23,140
activated so if you like if you like the

156
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:24,458
way which I'm guessing he does because

157
00:09:23,139 --> 00:09:27,958
I'm not sure I've ever seen heavy

158
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:27,958
without a spliff in his hand actually

159
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:55,990
you almost dropped that right on the

160
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:58,200
ding of the phone yeah it was pretty

161
00:09:55,990 --> 00:10:00,700
cool

162
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,170
all right now it's time for that sort of

163
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:04,959
like bones when I take a few minutes

164
00:10:02,169 --> 00:10:06,429
ladies thought they might have some

165
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:08,859
Center pants at yeah all right no

perturb that once I drop whatever you

167
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:11,850
looking for that point

168
00:10:14,029 --> 00:10:22,159
all right like that in a second or do

169
00:10:17,539 --> 00:10:31,039
you want to try business ie so give it

170
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:33,409
about I'll give an example

171
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:35,899
Hugh Rowland's look you're smoking maybe

172
00:10:33,409 --> 00:10:39,379
a grant 3/4 on the ground so that's

173
00:10:35,899 --> 00:10:44,000
going to be like 50 to 60 milligrams of

174
00:10:39,379 --> 00:10:47,470
THC exactly so what I gave you

175
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,470
and usually lose

176
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:55,790
70% of the effectiveness by just smoking

177
00:10:52,269 --> 00:10:59,659
this year's Combusken not vaporizing and

178
00:10:55,789 --> 00:11:00,929

00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:03,868
sublingual

180
00:11:00,929 --> 00:11:05,129
for militants of two drivers it's your

blood

182
00:11:05,129 --> 00:11:10,120
this you have to look at

183
00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:13,289
in sections of 60 milligrams she smoked

184
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:13,289
the joint right

185
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:22,360
that's like the equivalent

186
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:22,359
the drives you

187
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:26,259

348
00:21:58,259 --> 00:22:05,940
release of any sort of off gassing at

349

363
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:10,799
they legalized bus the errors no we said

364
00:23:06,339 --> 00:23:10,799
that we worked out is nicely Oh

365
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:14,280
participle players

366
00:23:18,619 --> 00:23:29,319
and the reason agnostic it was that or

367
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:29,319
suggested the farmers get 180 companies

368
00:23:31,909 --> 00:23:36,979
and their work in cooperatives

369
00:23:34,449 --> 00:23:39,859
foreigners as investors we want to

370
00:23:36,979 --> 00:23:42,828
compare the split to joint venture

371
00:23:39,858 --> 00:23:47,208
photographs with them this is what they

372
00:23:42,828 --> 00:23:50,898
were at that conference so you're there

373
00:23:47,209 --> 00:23:55,159
was it a to three day conference two

374
00:23:50,898 --> 00:24:03,998
days two days okay another little bit I

375
00:23:55,159 --> 00:24:03,999
suppose we see so that's health justice

376
00:24:05,108 --> 00:24:19,128
okay I'm learning all these ministers in

377
00:24:14,618 --> 00:24:21,618
industry and our worst commerce yeah and

378
00:24:19,128 --> 00:24:28,009
then even maybe another development mmm

379
00:24:21,618 --> 00:24:30,769
weird um Wallenberg Albert right see

380
00:24:28,009 --> 00:24:32,239
right will join us for a little example

381
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:34,038
don't you guys remember

382
00:24:32,239 --> 00:24:35,269
yeah well just kick kids is telling a

383
00:24:34,038 --> 00:24:36,798
little bit about the conference that

384
00:24:35,269 --> 00:24:40,149
just happened and what these guys were

385
00:24:36,798 --> 00:24:43,249
talking what they were offering to

386
00:24:40,148 --> 00:24:45,228
started collogues farm there's an acre

387
00:24:43,249 --> 00:24:47,179
at a time with creating coops and then

388
00:24:45,229 --> 00:24:49,019
joint ventures so that foreigners that

389
00:24:47,179 --> 00:24:52,100
come in and can't just start their own

390
00:24:49,019 --> 00:24:54,650
projects but required to make partners

391
00:24:52,099 --> 00:24:58,429
and so that all sounds pretty reasonable

392
00:24:54,650 --> 00:25:00,570
but the job's not the JumpStart

393
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:01,950
excellent it's good to see that things

394
00:25:00,569 --> 00:25:04,019
are moving forward each time we come

395
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:05,009
back there's more to be said there's

396
00:25:04,019 --> 00:25:08,190
more to good so let me know what you

397
00:25:05,009 --> 00:25:10,490

398
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:18,750
