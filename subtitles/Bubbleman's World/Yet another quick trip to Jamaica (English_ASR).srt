00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:25,820
hey guys welcome to bubble man's world I

3
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:28,368
am in Toronto I'm actually at the

4
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:29,960
Pearson International Airport I flew in

5
00:00:28,368 --> 00:00:31,820
a couple of hours ago for those of you

6
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,259
that pay attention to the Facebook page

7
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:36,500
you might have seen my funny little

8
00:00:33,259 --> 00:00:38,539
quote about well our last trip through

9
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,340
back home from Jamaica John and I ended

10
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:42,799
up going through security and security

11
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:46,280
was just being unbelievably difficult

12
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:48,140
with me for no apparent reason actually

13
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:51,890
no that's not true there was a reason in

14
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:54,500
the end they found a knife kind of like

15
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:56,658
a razor blade I brought for taking

16
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,789
clones while in Jamaica it ended up in

17
00:00:56,658 --> 00:01:00,259
the wrong bag they were looking at it I

18
00:00:58,789 --> 00:01:02,000
kind of made a mention and I can we

19
00:01:00,259 --> 00:01:04,969
hurry this out but she got snappy with

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,890
me that's how it started well in the end

21
00:01:04,969 --> 00:01:08,810
of it after she sort of went over my

22
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:10,760
stuff with a fine-tooth comb and John

23
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:12,680
was very much in pain standing there

24
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:15,228
watching he finally kind of lost it and

25
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:17,090
told the girl she was a [ __ ] [ __ ] at

26
00:01:15,228 --> 00:01:19,250
which point she pushed the button called

27
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:22,969
the police security airport everything

28
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:26,959
and then proceeded to tell me you said

29
00:01:22,969 --> 00:01:29,659
that and I said what and she said you

30
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:32,089
said that and so it was just this big

31
00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:33,469
sort of silly thing John and I got well

32
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:35,090
it was our puffs time actually it was an

33
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:37,189
hour that we would have spent vaporizing

34
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:39,409
before our flights that we ended up

35
00:01:37,189 --> 00:01:41,090
getting searched hardcore interviewed by

36
00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:43,129
the police interviewed by the airport

37
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:46,130
security finally allowed to get on the

38
00:01:43,129 --> 00:01:49,280
plane and yeah that was the last time I

39
00:01:46,129 --> 00:01:50,899
was in Toronto so I'm here again I'm

40
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,700
actually heading to Jamaica tomorrow

41
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:54,080
morning beautiful Jamaica we'll be

42
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:56,150
flying into the Norman Manley

43
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:59,120
International Airport in Kingston

44
00:01:56,150 --> 00:02:00,710
Jamaica and I'm gonna try and film a

45
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,810
little bit differently this time for you

46
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:04,640
guys I'm not sure if I'm gonna be

47
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:06,590
visiting any big gone you feels although

48
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,090
that seems silly to say because almost

49
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:11,090
definitely I'll end up visiting some

50
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:12,739
really big ganja fields but if not I

51
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:14,469
want to show you a little bit of Jamaica

52
00:02:12,739 --> 00:02:16,659
so I'm gonna be

53
00:02:14,469 --> 00:02:18,729
just different things that I might not

54
00:02:16,659 --> 00:02:21,819
otherwise show I'll try to get to a

55
00:02:18,729 --> 00:02:23,469
reggae concert I'll try to interview a

56
00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:26,650
couple of friends of mine that are in

57
00:02:23,469 --> 00:02:28,599
fairly well-known bands out there and of

58
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:31,300
course you know show you as much ganja

59
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:34,120
and hash as possible which brings me to

60
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:35,560
the moment I just realized this window

61
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:39,280
doesn't open here at all

62
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:43,030
I've got myself a pure hash joint right

63
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,560
here in the straw and I figured we could

64
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:47,080
go inside and puff this have a little

65
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,250
bit more of a talk and then I'll leave

66
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,770
you guys because it's already midnight

67
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:53,259
here I got to wake up early in about six

68
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:56,680
hours I suspect it'll be about five

69
00:02:53,259 --> 00:02:58,840
hours up to this joint and get myself on

70
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,909
a plane and fly to Jamaica it's a

71
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,620
four-hour flight from Toronto so not too

72
00:03:00,909 --> 00:03:04,120
bad it was about a four hour flight for

73
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:07,060
me to get here as well so eight hours

74
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:10,569

75
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:13,509
between I got the Pearson Airport behind

76
00:03:10,569 --> 00:03:14,859

77
00:03:13,509 --> 00:03:16,419
come with me we'll go inside and smoke

78
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:18,490

79
00:03:16,419 --> 00:03:22,059

[Music]

87
00:03:54,409 --> 00:04:02,090

88
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:02,089
to smoke it with me see what happens

89
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:25,090

00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:25,090
the second floor so this is the way out

91
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:42,668

92
00:04:38,288 --> 00:04:45,139
the street from the airport in fact I

93
00:04:42,668 --> 00:04:47,659

where John and I had our session the

95
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:51,760
last time we were here I think it's just

96
00:04:49,339 --> 00:04:51,759
over there

97
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:58,100
that isn't that a small world if it is

98
00:04:54,860 --> 00:05:02,710
or is it over here or is it down one

99
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:02,710
level not sure

100
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:10,340

278
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:57,609
that's a DeRose ago and then there's no

279
00:18:54,279 --> 00:19:00,569
battery charger and then the body and

280
00:18:57,609 --> 00:19:03,369
also comes with your death toll yeah

281
00:19:00,569 --> 00:19:05,470
that is such a nice little tool I got

282
00:19:03,369 --> 00:19:06,969
one of every room in my house and I

283
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:08,679
gotta say I saw these guys hitting it

284
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:10,470

285
00:19:08,679 --> 00:19:12,940
stick which I still love with the glass

286
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:14,650
chamber but it was really impressed with

287
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:17,380
this unit in the sense that wasn't a

288
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:19,509
copy of all the pens that already exist

289
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:21,940
and it actually seemed like innovation

290
00:19:19,509 --> 00:19:23,589
and it actually seemed like what Byrd

291
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:25,630
was trying to do was rather than just

292
00:19:23,589 --> 00:19:28,149
get in on the marquee to make some money

293
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:30,100
he was improving the quality of this pen

294
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:32,009
I can tell you these hit like almost no

295
00:19:30,099 --> 00:19:34,949

00:22:28,358 --> 00:22:34,478
yeah but I like what he sings it's got a

326
00:22:31,819 --> 00:22:34,479
good message

327
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:41,919
you feel good when you re singing those

328
00:22:39,009 --> 00:22:44,259
lyrics you know it's one of the things

329
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,640
as artists that it's important sometimes

330
00:22:44,259 --> 00:22:47,230
if you're trying to sing consciously

331
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:49,840
that you want other people to feel good

Oh

348
00:24:29,869 --> 00:24:35,669
I get the idea that this song is from

349
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:43,828
personal experience

350
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:43,829
[Music]

351
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:52,590

[Music]

353
00:24:52,589 --> 00:24:57,298
so hopefully maybe this trip we're gonna

354
00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:01,019
get a plan to help film a video for

355
00:24:57,298 --> 00:25:02,788
Ritchie for this song yeah that's what

356
00:25:01,019 --> 00:25:04,349
we got to do I've been talking to Tony

357
00:25:02,788 --> 00:25:06,869
about it Tony's already got a good

358
00:25:04,349 --> 00:25:08,428
outline for the song to show it in a

359
00:25:06,869 --> 00:25:11,459
really good light to show the medicinal

360
00:25:08,429 --> 00:25:14,100
purposes of cannabis take it outside of

361
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:17,700
just the smoking to get high and really

362
00:25:14,099 --> 00:25:19,649
show about more than one reason we know

363
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:27,830
the one reason already now we wanted to

364
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:30,509
share the more than one reason exactly

365
00:25:27,829 --> 00:25:43,250
the creams and the salves and the

366
00:25:30,509 --> 00:25:47,909
patches and the little foils clothing so

367
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:50,210
yeah even concrete making plastics out

368
00:25:47,909 --> 00:25:50,210
of it

369
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:58,059
they say over 50,000 commercial products

370
00:25:54,429 --> 00:26:02,559
for cannabis yeah and I personally seen

371
00:25:58,058 --> 00:26:05,349
hemp metal-metal stronger than titanium

372
00:26:02,558 --> 00:26:09,240
and lighter than aluminum to cut through

373
00:26:05,349 --> 00:26:11,469
glass yeah so this stuff is out there

374
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:13,569
and Jamaica's getting on board with

375
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:15,220
first decriminalization we're gonna see

376
00:26:13,569 --> 00:26:17,619
more things come out of Jamaica here in

377
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:20,200
the upcoming years I see Jamaica as

378
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:22,119
being a real contender in the I mean

379
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:25,659
what country has been promoting ganja

380
00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:28,569
and ganja use more through the model of

381
00:26:25,659 --> 00:26:30,010
reggae music and guys like Richie I mean

382

00:33:39,829 --> 00:33:42,829
our buddies

452
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:47,169
working that's all we need we just need

453
00:33:42,829 --> 00:33:49,769
a spot where we can all be

454
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:49,769
dad

455
00:34:16,869 --> 00:34:20,529
I was a giant pothole probably like I

456
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:22,000
don't know that looks like one of the

457
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:24,100
ones you see in the country when a cow

458
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,190
gets hit on the road or a horse

459
00:34:24,099 --> 00:34:29,650
no they burn it with tires on top of it

460
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:31,450
yeah and then the tires burned through

461
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:33,670
the concrete and make a giant hole like

462
00:34:31,449 --> 00:34:36,219
that but I don't think they would do

463
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:40,090
that up here I don't know

464
00:34:36,219 --> 00:34:41,529
well this is the buildings so we just

465
00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:44,170
got to a friend's property here he's

466
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:45,820
building up a really beautiful cool 3/4

467
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:48,730
of an acre it goes all the way up to the

468
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:51,250
top sorry for were here by the vehicles

469
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:53,829
and then goes down into this corner here

470
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:56,260
so this is potential property we could

471
00:34:53,829 --> 00:34:58,529
be looking at if we made our way out

472
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,530
