tango and rice IFFT give the tool a wipe

20
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:34,559
good etiquette never put a dirty tool

21
00:01:31,469 --> 00:01:37,079
into a man's clean hash very important

22
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,689
rule number one potentially of dabbing

23
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:43,500
etiquette a lot of you wondering can you

24
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:46,219
dab drop dry sift and bubble that is all

25
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:53,118

26
00:01:46,219 --> 00:01:53,118
next up run a dry sift dabbing it Oh

27
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:16,579
Renee she's got that close your eyes

28
00:02:12,689 --> 00:02:20,599
property I'm not sure what it is but it

29
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:20,600
pretty sure we used to call it the funk

30
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:31,140
all right so let's follow that up with

31
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:34,229
some sweet skunk 99% pure heads made

32
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:38,699
this just the other day grown by the

33
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:41,389
great gardener this is some definite

34
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:41,389
dank

35
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:17,290
yeah that's the one let's hit the barb

36
00:03:13,539 --> 00:03:22,519
this is beyond sticky and ridiculous

37
00:03:17,289 --> 00:03:26,599
also it's gonna destroy me cancer I'm

38
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:29,269
gonna follow it up with another hit so

39
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:30,889
let's go somewhat reasonable I say

40
00:03:29,269 --> 00:03:33,709
someone reasonable because we can't be

41
00:03:30,889 --> 00:03:36,318
completely reasonable anyway this is

42
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:44,709
what we're doing here this absolute

43
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:44,709
ridiculousness share that with you there

44
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:12,680
now to give you a little bit of a

45
00:04:11,329 --> 00:04:15,500
low-down on these hits that I've just

46
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:17,810
taken we started with the congolese

47
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:21,048
which is just a really beautiful exotic

48
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:22,850
African sativa very euphoric and

49
00:04:21,048 --> 00:04:24,918
uplifting and sativa

50
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:28,600
very inspiring makes you feel real

51
00:04:24,918 --> 00:04:32,959
positive followed that up with a Renee

52
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:34,610
dry sift hit dry sift renee is is rare

53
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:38,029
you don't see it too often but when you

54
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:39,470
do you get that full full body of

55
00:04:38,029 --> 00:04:41,359
terpenes although I can't say they were

56
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:43,310
washed away in the water process it was

57
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,580
really the Renee that first showed me

58
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:48,168
what alcohol soluble terpenes were so

59
00:04:46,579 --> 00:04:51,050
that was a great rip Renee's always

60
00:04:48,168 --> 00:04:53,839
strong fruity smell hazy overtones in

61
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:57,710
the in the smoke afterwards followed

62
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:59,329
that up by sweet skunk some 99% heads

63
00:04:57,709 --> 00:05:01,848
that I cleaned over with the grey

64
00:04:59,329 --> 00:05:05,149
gardener grown grown by them too darn

65
00:05:01,848 --> 00:05:07,628
near perfection that rip actually was

66
00:05:05,149 --> 00:05:10,878
the one that I took the break after a

67
00:05:07,629 --> 00:05:11,629
very good hit and followed that up with

68
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:16,129
the barb

69
00:05:11,629 --> 00:05:18,770
and the barb is the Afghani crossed with

70
00:05:16,129 --> 00:05:20,539
the shish kebab and the shish kebab was

71
00:05:18,769 --> 00:05:22,339
from the red line so there were two

72
00:05:20,538 --> 00:05:24,019
Afghani is used in the original creation

73
00:05:22,339 --> 00:05:27,859
of shish kebab there was a red line and

74
00:05:24,019 --> 00:05:29,718
a yellow line and the red line was the

75
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:32,870
one that was used in the creation of the

76
00:05:29,718 --> 00:05:35,689
shish kebab that was used in the barb so

77
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:43,009
going to finish it off now with a little

78
00:05:35,689 --> 00:05:47,120
of D 420 K's OG Kush dry cept and this

79
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:48,158
was actually made made by him and smoked

80
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,370

81
00:05:48,158 --> 00:05:51,370
