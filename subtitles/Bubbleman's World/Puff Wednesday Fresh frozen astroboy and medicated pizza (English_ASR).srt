grown an actual crop and it's been 20

10
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:46,600
years since I harvested an actual crop

11
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:49,839
and I've never taken my own plants and

12
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:51,558
just wash them into fresh frozen so as

13

doing this with you John you were really

104
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:02,918
you're really quite integral in

105
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:06,360
getting me back into growing getting me

106
00:05:02,918 --> 00:05:09,478
back into having the ability the access

107
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:11,919
the equipment all I did was uh open a

108
00:05:09,478 --> 00:05:14,279
door for you yeah but it was a it was a

109
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:16,758
very a door that you've already known so

110
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:19,239
well I still muchly appreciated you

111
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:20,680
opening it I'll tell you still do and

112
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:23,000
you can open that door too and you

113
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:25,478
should learn to grow like we're doing

114
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,079
here and the best thing about this is is

115
00:05:25,478 --> 00:05:29,120
this is exactly what you need to do to

116
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:30,918
produce real medicine is is what we're

117
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,000
doing this is the the cleanest and the

118
00:05:30,918 --> 00:05:34,879
freshest and probably I would say the

119
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,079
most efficacious way of for consuming

120
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:39,439
your endoc canabo well this is the

121
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:41,439
equivalent of ordering the pizza and

122
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:43,600
opening the box and eating the pizza not

123
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:44,800
the box with the pizza we're really just

124
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,600
people are sitting there watching and

125
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:50,120
they maybe thinking is this really worth

126
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:52,240
it is that really worth it well if is it

127
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,879
worth it to extract the medicine the

128
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,400
thing that you love about cannabis the

129
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:56,959
reason that you're growing it is it

130
00:05:55,399 --> 00:06:00,359
worth it to extract it so you can

131
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:02,959
acquire it in an unadulterated fashion

132
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:07,240
I absolutely think so man this thing has

133
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:09,120
a lot of uhct on it and how it is and as

134
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,519
this is gradually filling up I'm going

135
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,879
to say you're going to get roughly about

136
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:17,198
350 to 400 G of froze of wet out of this

137
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:19,399
which in in return is going to what I

138
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:22,759
equal out to what I always do got about

139
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:25,560
12 G or something yeah excellent yeah

140
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:27,080
exactly 10 to 12 gr that'd be surreal if

141
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:29,560
I even got close to that just from the

142
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:31,038
one little plant but and and actually

143
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,519
this was the little one there is that

144
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:35,800
great big one in the in the other

145
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:39,598

00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:50,199
mhm and so this is a actually I found

381
00:19:48,038 --> 00:19:52,519
this in your fridge and I kind of liked

382
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:56,440
it excellent and it's

383
00:19:52,519 --> 00:19:58,519
um basically veggie Ground Round but

384
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:00,840
it's the Mexican style so to me was like

385
00:19:58,519 --> 00:20:02,558
having a taco pizza oh yes you had the

386
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:05,319

pizza what's next um a little bit of

392
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:24,000
cheese I

393
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,279
guess I'll go over complex on my

394
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,038
toppings will probably put a little bit

395
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:30,918
more sift on top of

396
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:33,480
cheese so I got some on the bottom and

397
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:33,480
some on the

398
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:44,880

Hearts so this is just our medicated

409
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,798
piece and the best thing about with the

410
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:28,879
hemp seed Hearts it helps digest a lot

411
00:21:27,798 --> 00:21:29,879
better

412
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:34,360
yeah I'm definitely going to be doing

413
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:34,360
hemp seed Hearts right on top of these

414
00:21:44,798 --> 00:21:49,079

really is you can really feed your Endo

444
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:26,480
canomo system and I think we're going to

445
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:29,038
be saying this quite a bit because of um

446
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:31,519
Dr David Allen

the oils and even the leaf there's so

450
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,960
many different ways you can actually

451
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,320
ingest cannabis as a medicine we've be

452
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,960
doing it all through history just we

453
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:45,439

a essential amino acids and there's just

455
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:50,360
great ways of being able to uh the plant

538
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,558
welcome back John and I got uh pretty

539
00:29:14,558 --> 00:29:18,798
high on that pizza you know what we

540
00:29:16,558 --> 00:29:22,678
actually had na we melted out there we

541
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:26,000
we had we we of course dabbed open 420

542
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:28,038
and um here we are you know yeah here we

543
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,278
are we're going to finally run this

544
00:29:28,038 --> 00:29:31,720
batch we've been kind of wasting uh

545
00:29:30,278 --> 00:29:34,759
takes a lot to get ready you know we

546
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:38,159
lined um here's one cool thing we did we

547
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:41,679
lined pizza boxes with parchment paper

548
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:49,159
and on each box we marked them 190 and

549
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:52,840
160 120 120 90 Micron 73 73 and of

550
00:29:49,159 --> 00:29:55,320
course 45 and 25 so I thought that was

551
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:57,519
pretty uh pretty cool you know inside is

552
00:29:55,319 --> 00:30:00,200
uh lined with the parchment paper

553
00:29:57,519 --> 00:30:01,960
unbleached so we'll be able to easily

554
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:04,278
put our resins on there with lots of

555
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:06,558
room for it to sort of allow the

556
00:30:04,278 --> 00:30:08,880
cardboard to close over it be protected

557
00:30:06,558 --> 00:30:10,678
no dust no debris and uh course sucking

558
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,640
the moisture through the top end and

559
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:14,679
exactly so today we're going to use the

560
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:18,960
bubble now I've got actually a bunch of

561
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:21,159
new um Bubble now prototype um M washing

562
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,558
machine bags this one's a 20-gallon one

563
00:30:21,159 --> 00:30:25,080
and you could actually use two of these

564
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:27,759
in the 20-gon machine and it's just sort

565
00:30:25,079 --> 00:30:29,918
of one of uh uh my uh my manufa act's

566
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:32,158
old designs he sort of revamped it and

567
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:33,519
he's actually thrown his uh label on

568
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:35,960
there for the first time when you start

569
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:37,679
seeing Acme label you'll know that

570
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:41,679
that's been my manufacturer for the past

571
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:43,679
12 or so years and uh yeah he uh helps

572
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:45,960
helps make uh makes make the product a

573
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:48,038
little bit better for you guys out there

574
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:51,558
so here's another flatter design a nice

575
00:30:48,038 --> 00:30:53,398
big open zipper in the middle you can

576
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:55,558
just stuff that full this is also for a

577
00:30:53,398 --> 00:30:56,839
larger washing machine kind of a cool

578
00:30:55,558 --> 00:30:59,240
design not something we're going to play

579
00:30:56,839 --> 00:31:00,638
with today today um although he does

580
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,880
have a smaller one right here that could

581
00:31:00,638 --> 00:31:05,038
potentially fit in here a little bit big

582
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,200
compared to uh the barrel shaped bag

583
00:31:05,038 --> 00:31:08,679
which fits just perfect but a lot of

584
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,159
people are using different machines a

585
00:31:08,679 --> 00:31:11,919
lot of people are using larger washing

586
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:14,519
machines so we wanted to start offering

587
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:17,278
the marketplace um some alternatives to

588
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:19,798
the standard same old same old bags um

589
00:31:17,278 --> 00:31:23,240
today I think I'm going to go with my

590
00:31:19,798 --> 00:31:25,879
old standby um I've got quite a few runs

591
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:27,638
to do so I'll get to the Prototype bag

592
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,679
uh probably on the second or third plant

593
00:31:27,638 --> 00:31:30,759
but for now we're going to use the

594
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:32,038
barrel-shaped bag and we're going to

595
00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:34,919
pretty much do it just like we did with

596
00:31:32,038 --> 00:31:38,158
yours John we're going to stack ice herb

597
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:40,600
ice herb ice herb right to the top nice

598
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:44,039
and I'm thinking uh Bubble Bag Originals

599
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:47,918
we've got the three tiers um Bubble Bag

600
00:31:44,038 --> 00:31:51,278
lights these ones uh are the the the the

601
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:55,159
money saver 150 bucks uh for a eight bag

602
00:31:51,278 --> 00:31:57,000
5 gallon kit John's holding the bubble

603
00:31:55,159 --> 00:31:59,519
bag standards these ones are an eight

604
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:02,679
bag kit as well you get all the colors

605
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:05,558

606
00:32:02,679 --> 00:32:07,840
$275 for an eight bag kit nice and then

607
00:32:05,558 --> 00:32:09,918

660
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:46,838
it sitting also packed chalk full of ice

661
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:49,918
it's uh definitely

662
00:34:46,838 --> 00:34:54,239
4° that ice is not going to be melting

663
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:57,078
away on us so I guess uh go with pouring

664
00:34:54,239 --> 00:35:00,639
a little bit of this in first I'm

665
00:34:57,079 --> 00:35:00,640
sitting back watching this whole thing

666
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:17,800
happen what we got there I'll

667
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:17,800
put make sure it's good to

668
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:25,079
go water everywhere all right not a ton

669
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:27,039
ton of ice in inside the machine but a

670
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:28,200
decent amount nice job you hit the that

671
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:32,279
perfect it's like you've done that

672
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:32,279
before i' top it off just the tiniest

673
00:35:33,079 --> 00:35:39,400
bit bring it up another inch or

674
00:35:36,358 --> 00:35:44,639
so close that

675
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:44,639
up and let's go for a little mixing I

676
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:51,838
say 4 and 1/2

677
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:55,199
minutes 4 and 1/2 minutes 4 and A2

678
00:35:51,838 --> 00:35:58,559
minutes time to do a rip huh yeah catch

all right so while that's over there

681
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,760
mixing it up we thought we would show

682
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:05,240
you guys even though I'm sure you guys

683

order do they go in that's what we're

686
00:36:09,559 --> 00:36:13,759
going to go through right now there you

687
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:17,400
go a lot of people always want to use

688
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:19,480
the 190 and go right to the 45 it's true

689
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:21,720
there's a reason for this people listen

690
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:24,400
so we go in an order the this it's a

691
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:26,719
seeve stack the 220 is the largest bag

692
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:32,119
the blue bag and it goes down through

693
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:34,239
220 190 160 120 90 73 45 and 25 the

694
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:36,079
first bag you put in in a stack like

695
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:40,318
that of course is going to be the bottom

696
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:41,720
one the 25 that's a purple bag so we'll

697
00:36:40,318 --> 00:36:44,079
get that guy in

698
00:36:41,719 --> 00:36:46,439
there fits in nicely into the bubble

699
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:48,800
bucket yeah help me wrap that around

700
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:51,000
there perfect we could actually lift

701
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:53,720
that one up even a tiny bit there we go

702
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:57,280
perfect y

703
00:36:53,719 --> 00:36:58,959
second the 45 micron

704
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:05,160

awesome

708
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:17,920
yeah second bag complete next comes my

709
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:21,519
favorite uh John's favorite is the gold

710
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:24,639
73 I like the 73 wearing the 73 today on

711
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:27,039
my shirt I think it gives me my Pain

712
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:29,598
release with my with my medicine with my

713
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:31,199
medic push and that's the 73 that works

714
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:33,960
for me and you'll find the bag that you

715
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:36,439
like the most some people like the 45

716
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:40,400
some people like the 160 yeah I'm a 90

717
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:44,119
fan 90 and 73 I I kind of happen 120

718
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:45,800
them all I know right it's kind everyone

719
00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:49,079
but I mean the one that always runs out

720
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:51,519
for me is always the the 90 70 then the

721
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:53,519
120 the 73 it's the order that lets you

722
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:56,039
know really what is the best and what

723
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:58,318
you want so we're at the 90 this is my

724
00:37:56,039 --> 00:38:02,358
favorite almost exclusively it's just a

725
00:37:58,318 --> 00:38:05,759
good bag you get some fire in the in the

726
00:38:02,358 --> 00:38:08,838
90 all right crack that

727
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:10,560
open getting a little bit tighter on our

728
00:38:08,838 --> 00:38:12,239
with all the bags we put in now we put

729
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:15,440
in

730
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:19,358
four so it's good to keep the so

731
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:23,280
remember spreading it up these 90

732
00:38:19,358 --> 00:38:24,480
120 7390 the 120 that the following you

733
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,880
don't take

734
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:29,240
out you don't take out what do you mean

735
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:31,119
well I have you know cuz I do work at a

736
00:38:29,239 --> 00:38:32,959
local hydroponic store and they're like

737
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:34,800
oh we just used the 160 in oh so you're

738
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,559
talking about leaving the bag out of

739
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,640
even using it yeah of course you never

740
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:41,358
take any bags out in fact I'll just to

741
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:43,759
reiterate always use all the bags it's

742
00:38:41,358 --> 00:38:45,960
going to help you understand more of

743
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:48,119
what's going on each time and it may

744
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:49,679
surprise you sometime and if you if you

745
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:51,838
cut yourself off from that and you just

746
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:53,480
use a few of those bags you don't get

747
00:38:51,838 --> 00:38:55,039
the out do they ever have anything

748
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:56,000
inspiring they they're like oh mine

749
00:38:55,039 --> 00:38:58,358
doesn't smell like that and you don't

750
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,559
want to hit it kidding of course not and

751
00:38:58,358 --> 00:39:02,358
they're excited like well uh yeah I just

752
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:04,559
I got the three B I want you to hit this

753
00:39:02,358 --> 00:39:07,159
it's like well why would you do that

754
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:09,599
three bag system I was like ribon yeah I

755
00:39:07,159 --> 00:39:13,199
mean three bag system was something in

756
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:15,079
1999 2000 oh I think I heard that b stop

757
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:17,519
over there excellent well we'll rush

758
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:20,200
over there once we uh finish with our

759
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:23,280
last three bags how about that we've got

760
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:25,719
our 160 left we just put our 120 the

761
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:28,720
orange bag in after the 90 Micron there

762
00:39:25,719 --> 00:39:31,159
we go this is our 160 it is red we're

763
00:39:28,719 --> 00:39:32,879
going to get that in there and then

764
00:39:31,159 --> 00:39:36,759
we'll literally walk this Bucket over

765
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:42,200
there and we will filter some

766
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:44,400
hash I might even do a second run almost

767
00:39:42,199 --> 00:39:46,838
immediately with that material just to

768
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:48,880
see how efficient we've been always a

769
00:39:46,838 --> 00:39:50,599
nice idea to check some people like to

770
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,280
run and run and run and run I'm going to

771
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:56,039
do two runs and then I'm going to soak

772
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:58,599
my material um in a coconut oil and do a

773
00:39:56,039 --> 00:40:00,199
little extraction like that something

774
00:39:58,599 --> 00:40:02,599
that I haven't done that I'm going to do

775
00:40:00,199 --> 00:40:03,679
next time myself I love the idea

776
00:40:02,599 --> 00:40:06,400
everybody's talking about the Rick

777
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:09,118
Simpson Oil and stuff well you know what

778
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,960
coconut oil guys yeah and not not just

779
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:12,960
using your shitty uh you know I'm not

780
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,280
going to only use the left over bubble

781
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,519
material I'm going to use some of my

782
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:20,480
good dry sift and some of my good bubble

783
00:40:16,519 --> 00:40:23,039
to actually produce some nice uh coconut

784
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:26,000
infused oil I think we should pull this

785
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:27,599
one down a little bit more it's tight

786
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:33,440
but we can do

787
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:35,519
it try and do there we go it's coming

788
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:37,280
nicely sometimes all it takes is a

789
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:39,119
friend to give you a hand here well it's

790
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:41,280
also how well you like on this side I

791
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:42,838
pulled mine down very well because you

792
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:45,319
see how it goes down below the bags on

793
00:40:42,838 --> 00:40:47,119
this side the way he's the way the bags

794
00:40:45,318 --> 00:40:49,199
are added and this little metal piece is

795
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:51,160
catching up on his side so we could have

796
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:53,480
easily removed this little metal piece

797
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:55,239
but uh we kind of spaced it but that's

798
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:57,159
the reason the bags are are catching up

799
00:40:55,239 --> 00:41:00,039
cuz John had the whole metal piece on

800
00:40:57,159 --> 00:41:02,639
his side so yeah there you go one more

801
00:41:00,039 --> 00:41:04,960
bag and we're good one more bag yeah

802
00:41:02,639 --> 00:41:07,358
it's not too bad it's only up a little

803
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:10,519
bit try to keep that one up as high as

804
00:41:07,358 --> 00:41:11,559
we can go ahead take your side first

805
00:41:10,519 --> 00:41:14,759
there we

806
00:41:11,559 --> 00:41:18,318
go perfect yeah this bag's a little bit

807
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:20,640
wider I keep that nice and

808
00:41:18,318 --> 00:41:22,679
open yeah just leave that like that

809
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:24,960
almost like a little bit off the tip of

810
00:41:22,679 --> 00:41:28,000
the lip and it lifts the screen up for

811
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:30,280
us now this is the 220 bag we are using

812
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,920
a 220 bag in the machine over there but

813
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:34,280
it's never a bad idea to double up on

814
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:36,480
bags I like that even if you had extra

815
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:38,160
bags in your kit like an extra 160 or an

816
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,639
extra 120 you could throw them in there

817
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:43,000
and you'd be surprised at what you uh

818
00:41:40,639 --> 00:41:44,480
might find yourself keeping from the

819
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,199

836
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:45,880
we'll have to first have it a little bit

837
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:52,159
lower just for the drain let's see what

838

841
00:42:58,199 --> 00:43:03,358
through some Kool-Aid colored water

842
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:06,480

844
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:12,639
was 4 minutes 4 and 1/2 minutes maybe

845
00:43:09,719 --> 00:43:15,358
and I'll probably fill this back up with

846
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:19,920
water plug it in over the Over Yonder

847

00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:26,359
water I'll fill another bucket up to

850
00:43:24,159 --> 00:43:28,838
cool it with ice water and then I'll do

851
00:43:26,358 --> 00:43:30,880
one second run once we pull this we'll

852

Yonder we'll get this guy up here right

873
00:44:23,159 --> 00:44:28,879
in between us now is this where we're

874
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:31,318
going to do our cleaning right here

875
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:33,800
right here this is where our cleaning is

876
00:44:31,318 --> 00:44:35,279
done so this I'm going to switch sides

877
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:37,280
cuz I'm going to be cleaning over here

878
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:39,040
okay and then what I'll do real quick

879
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:41,040
I'll get R of here is I'll move a few of

880
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:44,599
these things out of the way mostly

881
00:44:41,039 --> 00:44:47,639
cannabis plants telephones and

882
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:50,920
such and I'll make a little bit of

883
00:44:47,639 --> 00:44:54,759
room cleaning right

884
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:57,519
here um basically you know microing I

885
00:44:54,760 --> 00:45:00,640
should say not cleaning

886
00:44:57,519 --> 00:45:03,400
here's we're getting ready here Johnny

887
00:45:00,639 --> 00:45:06,519
here's your micr planer perfect SW for

888
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:09,160
it ah yes my SE my SE that is my SE

889
00:45:06,519 --> 00:45:10,679
there we go we're sing now and and

890
00:45:09,159 --> 00:45:13,078
reason why is because we saw the microp

891
00:45:10,679 --> 00:45:14,399
planing and I think we were damaging

892
00:45:13,079 --> 00:45:17,318
those heads I never was into

893
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:19,559
microplaning yeah no no never got into

894
00:45:17,318 --> 00:45:21,079
it no I did I'm not against those who

895
00:45:19,559 --> 00:45:22,440
were into it I don't claim that they're

896
00:45:21,079 --> 00:45:24,000
destroying anything I don't think

897
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:26,559
they're degrading anything worse than I

898
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,039
am I just don't I don't like the way it

899
00:45:26,559 --> 00:45:29,760
looks under the macro lens I don't like

900
00:45:28,039 --> 00:45:32,119
the way it makes me feel when I go into

901
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:35,800
that world and I see those heads just

902
00:45:32,119 --> 00:45:38,240
ripped mated like I I I did it I we did

903
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:41,440
that video you know what I will always

904
00:45:38,239 --> 00:45:45,639
use the sift yeah I like the SE I like

905
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:47,679
the SE so little bit of uh 220 there

906
00:45:45,639 --> 00:45:49,039
nothing much might just wash it what

907
00:45:47,679 --> 00:45:51,000
like to do oh I know what we're going to

908
00:45:49,039 --> 00:45:54,800
require all right so we set up the

909
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:56,559
pressing screens inside its own box um I

910
00:45:54,800 --> 00:46:00,240
got a paper towel laid down to absorb

911
00:45:56,559 --> 00:46:01,640
moisture so we've got our um our spoon

912
00:46:00,239 --> 00:46:03,799
and we're sort of ready to start

913
00:46:01,639 --> 00:46:06,639
collecting we got a little spray bottle

914
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:08,760
nice um we can start collecting bags oh

915
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:10,759
you know what would really be nice the

916
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:12,920
small bucket that we used last time to

917
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:15,280
flip all the bags inside out that's the

918
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:17,599
last thing I will be right

919
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:19,519
back all right I ended up getting that

920
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:22,000
bucket super important to have this just

921
00:46:19,519 --> 00:46:24,480
to be able to flip the bags over we are

922
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,920
likeing a bucket I've always liked the

923
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:28,079
bucket you know it's just a nice little

924
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:29,559
little option this one's a little bit

925
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:31,880
smaller than the actual size of the

926
00:46:29,559 --> 00:46:33,480
screen but I mean how convenient is that

927
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:38,318
that's so

928
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:40,159
convenient a little spray mostly

929
00:46:38,318 --> 00:46:41,639
contaminant did I tell you how much I

930
00:46:40,159 --> 00:46:46,159
love this spray

931
00:46:41,639 --> 00:46:46,159
bottle dude use it all the

932
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:51,159
time it's a good little

933
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:57,880
bottle all right well little bit of 220

934
00:46:55,960 --> 00:47:00,280
not too much to see there on the

935
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:03,358
camera basically

936
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:06,519
nothing yet something but always yet

937
00:47:03,358 --> 00:47:09,519
something it's resin basically

938
00:47:06,519 --> 00:47:11,000
nothing but something the tiniest it

939
00:47:09,519 --> 00:47:12,519
just shows at the work bag that was

940
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,159
initially in there do you want to take

941
00:47:12,519 --> 00:47:15,838
that with the bucket for

942
00:47:14,159 --> 00:47:18,440
cleaning

943
00:47:15,838 --> 00:47:21,358
okay all right so as John's doing that I

944
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:21,358
will lift the next

945
00:47:22,838 --> 00:47:31,279
bag also very little there

946
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:31,280
little well that one's almost

947
00:47:34,639 --> 00:47:39,440
nothing there you go s thank you thank

948
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:51,079
you this one is is even less John even

949
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:53,440
less very little 160 which makes a lot

950
00:47:51,079 --> 00:47:56,359
of sense when you're running fresh

951
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:58,240
Frozen um

952
00:47:56,358 --> 00:48:00,400
you're not using a lot of dry material

953
00:47:58,239 --> 00:48:02,799
it's fresh it's Tricom heads are

954
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:04,559
breaking off and almost nothing else and

955
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:06,760
you're

956
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:08,160
uh you're not going to see too much on

957
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:10,280
these in the 160 all you know what's

958
00:48:08,159 --> 00:48:11,598
going to happen we're going to just get

959
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:13,559
the

960
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:18,039

964
00:48:24,639 --> 00:48:32,078
nail here we go just a tiny little bit

965
00:48:28,679 --> 00:48:34,799
of contamination on there the slightest

966
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:37,318
little amount bar barely able to scoop

967
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:37,318

968
00:48:38,039 --> 00:48:44,159

1025
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:07,559
just to see how effective we were I

1026
00:52:05,679 --> 00:52:10,480
really didn't break the Nuggets up so

1027
00:52:07,559 --> 00:52:13,160
we're going to get what I would call the

1028
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:17,280
best of the

1029
00:52:13,159 --> 00:52:19,798
best awesome there we go a

1030
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:24,000
second yeah I'm going to do it in my in

1031
00:52:19,798 --> 00:52:24,000
my different uh all screen

1032
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:29,920
bag

1033
00:52:27,039 --> 00:52:29,920
let's see go

1034
00:52:31,039 --> 00:52:38,239
there just to give it that last little

1035
00:52:34,159 --> 00:52:38,239
rinse inside the bag before

1036
00:52:41,519 --> 00:52:47,039
you that's nice and cold water it's so

1037
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:49,559
cold it's not very sticky yet but I

1038
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:53,279
suspect once the water evaporates off my

1039
00:52:49,559 --> 00:52:57,040
hands but it could get a little stickier

1040
00:52:53,280 --> 00:53:00,040
well that water really is Rose Colored

1041
00:52:57,039 --> 00:53:00,039
you see it in the white

1042
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:15,639

different um I try not to make any

1060
00:54:53,159 --> 00:54:57,920
assumptions based on a couple of runs

1061
00:54:55,599 --> 00:55:00,559
yeah

1062
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:03,440

plus you'll have like covered it bred it

1065

with this bred it with that you know

1066
00:55:07,838 --> 00:55:12,358
what I mean like be interesting I like

1067
00:55:10,039 --> 00:55:15,480
seeing this right

1068
00:55:12,358 --> 00:55:17,039
now yeah it really is I'm excited to run

that again because I know there's more

1070
00:55:17,039 --> 00:55:22,279
material in

1071
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:26,960
there I saw it with my macro

1072
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:29,240
lens all right L 25 Micron that last

1075
00:55:31,838 --> 00:55:35,038
most of the tricomes I

1076
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:40,480
photograph but I guess that's uh could

1077
00:55:37,838 --> 00:55:40,480
be deceiving

1078
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:45,240
too who whoops we're coming around I

1079
00:55:43,798 --> 00:55:47,880

1083
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:57,000
egag system I got the last one right

1084

00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:17,838
micron last but certainly not

1090
00:56:14,119 --> 00:56:17,838

1091
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:27,358

00:56:52,679 --> 00:56:58,159
I'm just looking for is like here how

1100
00:56:55,559 --> 00:57:00,599
that The Bu

1101
00:56:58,159 --> 00:57:03,279
excellent all right well uh I guess

1102
00:57:00,599 --> 00:57:04,519
we'll get to moving some of this water

1103
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:09,200
out of the

1104
00:57:04,519 --> 00:57:12,318
way my back that's pretty good eh look

1105
00:57:09,199 --> 00:57:15,000
how awesome it looks high five far yeah

1106
00:57:12,318 --> 00:57:17,599
dude I like this one's already dry okay

1107
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:19,280
yeah because it dried on my back nice it

1108
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:21,280
pushed up against my back and then let

1109
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:22,760
out all the water but I don't mind

1110
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:25,359
getting a little wet especially when I'm

1111
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:28,240
making bubble hash so uh we got

1112
00:57:25,358 --> 00:57:29,759
ourselves a nice little miniature yield

1113
00:57:28,239 --> 00:57:32,199
much smaller than I was expecting

1114
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:34,400
actually but you know this still could

1115
00:57:32,199 --> 00:57:36,679
be 2 to three gr and we might have only

1116
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:40,079
run a couple of ounces dry so there's

1117
00:57:36,679 --> 00:57:42,118
probably still another 3 to four G on

1118
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:43,839
that material I I would say those big

1119
00:57:42,119 --> 00:57:45,720
buds that weren't broken down yet and

1120
00:57:43,838 --> 00:57:47,078
breaking all those buds apart it was

1121
00:57:45,719 --> 00:57:50,279
just kind of throw it in there let's

1122
00:57:47,079 --> 00:57:51,960
just do get the best that we can get so

1123
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:54,039
now we're going to do that while I let

1124
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:57,280
this still absorb itself from the water

1125
00:57:54,039 --> 00:57:59,680
cuz it's not ready yet to be sifted to

1126
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:02,440
to be seed sorry um we'll leave this for

1127
00:57:59,679 --> 00:58:05,000
about maybe 3 to 5 minutes if that and

1128
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:08,240
I'm going to go prepare the machine for

1129
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:11,400
a second run so I will sweet second run

1130
00:58:08,239 --> 00:58:14,598
yeah second run it will be nice and open

1131
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:16,838
and he'll be able to see what Tri you

1132
00:58:14,599 --> 00:58:18,760
want to put this into uh under bucket

1133
00:58:16,838 --> 00:58:19,960
I'm not too worried about it just want

1134
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:21,359
to get it done and I want everyone to be

1135
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:23,720
able to see what we're

1136
00:58:21,358 --> 00:58:26,719
doing

1137
00:58:23,719 --> 00:58:26,719
so

1138
00:58:31,838 --> 00:58:36,679
yeah all right that's so the zipper

1139
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:40,079
doesn't open in man does that thing work

1140
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:42,399
you do not want this thing opening up in

1141
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:42,400
mid

1142
00:58:42,679 --> 00:58:48,000
run okay oh look at that one big solid

1143
00:58:46,039 --> 00:58:51,039
butt yes it

1144
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:53,199
is I'm going to break these off they

1145
00:58:51,039 --> 00:58:56,720
they're coming off so perfect just

1146
00:58:53,199 --> 00:58:56,719
stripping from this stock

1147
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:05,000
yeah we're definitely

1148
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:07,400
um I can already see we can just see all

1149
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:08,960
the tries in there look at that excuse

1150
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:10,599
me if I could just get my hand for a

1151
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:13,159
second to grab another big negative

1152
00:59:10,599 --> 00:59:15,519
sorts there must be more big ones in

1153
00:59:13,159 --> 00:59:16,558
here oh yeah these are there's a big one

1154
00:59:15,519 --> 00:59:19,358

1155
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:21,599
want a big new

1156
00:59:19,358 --> 00:59:23,199
Jay you can see these are all just full

1157
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:24,318
of Frozen ice in the middle is kind of

1158
00:59:23,199 --> 00:59:26,279
cool when you break them apart they're

1159
00:59:24,318 --> 00:59:28,199
all Frozen yeah they do they split and

1160
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:29,160
have ice all throughout them yeah all

1161
00:59:28,199 --> 00:59:30,798
the way through the sunent that's why

1162
00:59:29,159 --> 00:59:32,239
they break so perfect you don't I've

1163
00:59:30,798 --> 00:59:34,159
actually never done this before so it's

1164
00:59:32,239 --> 00:59:36,558
really cool to see us that in the middle

1165
00:59:34,159 --> 00:59:39,118
of the buds there's like just like

1166
00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:41,200
ice i don't think I need these scissors

1167
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:47,039
no we don't

1168
00:59:41,199 --> 00:59:47,038
I more huge nuggets nice Frozen

1169
00:59:47,358 --> 00:59:52,279
nugs it's definitely nice and easy to

1170
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:52,280
break them

1171
00:59:52,599 --> 00:59:59,039
up quite a bit our our smaller so it's

1172
00:59:55,920 --> 01:00:01,880
really just those few large pieces that

1173
00:59:59,039 --> 01:00:01,880
we needed to break

1174
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:11,318
up let me finish it up

1175
01:00:07,838 --> 01:00:14,759
there and I will

1176
01:00:11,318 --> 01:00:19,519
get the next batch of bags

1177
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:21,839
ready oh look at this B I found here

1178
01:00:19,519 --> 01:00:23,920
excellent we like those big and in the

1179
01:00:21,838 --> 01:00:25,558
center it's like these little yeah just

1180
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:26,960
it's it's really cool to actually see

1181
01:00:25,559 --> 01:00:29,119
this way I've never looked at it this

1182
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:30,639
way that's cool taking these buds apart

1183
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:32,160
and how it's still just nice and Frozen

1184
01:00:30,639 --> 01:00:34,759
in the middle you can see how the ice

1185
01:00:32,159 --> 01:00:37,920
working away in here we are cold all

1186
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:40,400
right so

1187
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:42,559
Frozen I love the way I can just access

1188
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:44,920
the bags through the uh through the spin

1189
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:47,079
wheel through the spin wheel yeah maybe

1190
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:48,639
you can get yourself a spin wheel I like

1191
01:00:47,079 --> 01:00:51,240
it it's a good

1192
01:00:48,639 --> 01:00:53,519
idea just happen to be just happen to be

1193
01:00:51,239 --> 01:00:55,199
hanging around just happen to be hanging

1194
01:00:53,519 --> 01:00:59,038
around

1195
01:00:55,199 --> 01:00:59,038
I wonder how many times not a standup

1196
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:06,719
comedian well this is definitely

1197
01:01:07,159 --> 01:01:13,118
um getting more broke up there all

1198
01:01:10,679 --> 01:01:15,639
nicely broke up now all right I'll just

1199
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:17,400
pack another bag of ice into that I have

1200
01:01:15,639 --> 01:01:19,358
one more bag of ice that'll one more bag

1201
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:22,318
of ice pack in there

1202
01:01:19,358 --> 01:01:26,440
and we'll do a nice quick second

1203
01:01:22,318 --> 01:01:26,440
run see if we can't

1204
01:01:28,199 --> 01:01:33,480
up the anti on our our

1205
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:35,358
yield not that I'm personally too

1206
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:36,960
worried whatever I get is the medicine I

1207
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:39,679
get and I'm going to be soaking this

1208
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:41,559
plant matter and coconut oil afterwards

1209
01:01:39,679 --> 01:01:44,558
doing this the two batches through the

1210
01:01:41,559 --> 01:01:47,280
bubble bags and I still have more plants

1211
01:01:44,559 --> 01:01:48,960
left so it's just new ground not a lot

1212
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:51,839
of people really can tell you how much

1213
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:53,440
resin they get off of a plant you know

1214
01:01:51,838 --> 01:01:56,038
that they

1215
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:58,480
grew

1216
01:01:56,039 --> 01:02:00,480
awesome oh you pulled the last one out

1217
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:02,119
see I was leaving that one for you I see

1218
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:03,880
a bunch more look at this one look at

1219
01:02:02,119 --> 01:02:06,920
this giant one I'm trying joking no

1220
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:08,720
you're doing killing you're killing it

1221
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:10,798
this isn't your first rodeo although

1222
01:02:08,719 --> 01:02:12,838
that's a pretty big butt yeah have you P

1223
01:02:10,798 --> 01:02:15,199
that one I just dug you just said it

1224
01:02:12,838 --> 01:02:17,119
wasn't my first Ro you don't know how

1225
01:02:15,199 --> 01:02:19,239
many Ro I figured you've been to a few

1226
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:21,798
though

1227
01:02:19,239 --> 01:02:25,519
couple all right

1228
01:02:21,798 --> 01:02:28,119
so we got this plant matter all wet and

1229
01:02:25,519 --> 01:02:31,038
goopy breaking these buds down a little

1230
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:33,200
bit by finger they're very cold I

1231
01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:35,880
suggest doing it when they're cold all

1232
01:02:33,199 --> 01:02:38,000
nice and Ice Yep they're not sticking to

1233
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:39,880
my fingers whatsoever nothing at all

1234
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:42,400
that's what's really cool if you

1235
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:43,880
actually want to grab the bag of ice

1236
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:48,240
just behind

1237
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:48,240
you get rid of this guy over

1238
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:56,359
here we'll get him in

1239
01:02:53,358 --> 01:02:56,358
there

1240
01:02:58,318 --> 01:03:03,159
beautiful stuffed it I love that stuffed

1241
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:06,480
it that's what we like to see it's all

1242
01:03:03,159 --> 01:03:09,519
about the ice the more the merrier the

1243
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:11,358
colder the more heads fall off yeah you

1244
01:03:09,519 --> 01:03:12,880
want to ensure your cold temperature so

1245
01:03:11,358 --> 01:03:14,159
I mean obviously it's going to get to a

1246
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:16,760
certain temperature and then it's going

1247
01:03:14,159 --> 01:03:20,639
to Plateau but if you can get it to

1248
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:25,520
4° four yeah four is

1249
01:03:20,639 --> 01:03:29,118
great 4.2 brittle 4.2 and then we will

1250
01:03:25,519 --> 01:03:32,038
use our chilled tarpine Rich water that

1251
01:03:29,119 --> 01:03:34,440
we filtered through a 25 micron to

1252
01:03:32,039 --> 01:03:36,599
remove any sort of little bits or bats

1253
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:41,039
that would have been from the

1254
01:03:36,599 --> 01:03:41,039
last all right going to drop that in

1255
01:03:41,239 --> 01:03:47,000

great at the top that's okay a little

1260
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:57,400
bit little bit of Overboard on the Rosé

1261
01:03:55,239 --> 01:03:59,719

1265

1271
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:12,679
bubble dabbing while we

1272
01:05:12,838 --> 01:05:18,480

1278
01:06:04,230 --> 01:06:07,320
[Applause]

1279
01:06:12,519 --> 01:06:17,278
so second run you know we left that out

1280
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:18,920
for the tiniest little bit there I was

1281
01:06:17,278 --> 01:06:20,599
like oh it looks pretty fresh I'll just

1282
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:22,440
leave it out and then I'll I'll I

1283
01:06:20,599 --> 01:06:25,960
thought I was a pretty good judge of the

1284
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:27,760
seeve that [ __ ] is the Gummi gooiest

1285
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:30,920

01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:34,240
stuck to the pressing screen snot I had

1287
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:36,680
to go uh put it in the freezer and we're

1288

going to have to se that one so that's

1289
01:06:36,679 --> 01:06:40,480
just the way that is and uh I guess

1290
01:06:39,318 --> 01:06:43,480
we're at the point where we're going to

1291
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:48,039
do another drain the the watercolor was

1292

01:07:13,639 --> 01:07:18,639
definitely not the same uh color that it

1305
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:21,838
was when we started with the first bat

1306
01:07:18,639 --> 01:07:21,838
so it's creamy

1307
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:28,159
though just stinks the h

1308
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:30,679
oh does it ever smell so good it's great

1309
01:07:28,159 --> 01:07:31,798
doesn't love that and what's interesting

1310
01:07:30,679 --> 01:07:33,838
what's going to be the best part about

1311
01:07:31,798 --> 01:07:35,599
it is actually like what I've done on my

1312
01:07:33,838 --> 01:07:38,038
second rent at my house I've actually

1313
01:07:35,599 --> 01:07:40,119
saved it dried it up I have it all

1314
01:07:38,039 --> 01:07:41,920
sitting there and one day I might have a

1315
01:07:40,119 --> 01:07:44,318
test it and worth looking at it but you

1316
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:46,039
know what photograph it too I can

1317
01:07:44,318 --> 01:07:48,119
photograph it that's what I kind of plan

1318
01:07:46,039 --> 01:07:50,880
on doing with this he photographing it

1319
01:07:48,119 --> 01:07:53,400
after I ran it and seeing uh seeing what

1320
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:54,798
we got going on can always do this with

1321
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:56,440
the machine there's always just a tiny

1322
01:07:54,798 --> 01:07:59,239
little bit of water that'll Fe fit in

1323
01:07:56,440 --> 01:08:01,240
the spinner disc at the bottom and just

1324
01:07:59,239 --> 01:08:03,639
lean it

1325
01:08:01,239 --> 01:08:08,000
over get it all

1326
01:08:03,639 --> 01:08:09,078
out get some cold water awesome I like

1327
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:11,599
the idea of just getting this out of the

1328
01:08:09,079 --> 01:08:13,160
way right away I unpluging it for you I

1329
01:08:11,599 --> 01:08:15,838
know how you like to do that you're the

1330
01:08:13,159 --> 01:08:17,318
man you're the man best assistant on the

1331
01:08:15,838 --> 01:08:19,880
whole

1332
01:08:17,319 --> 01:08:22,640
planet always is more helpful than

1333
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:27,319
helpful I used to work

1334
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:28,798
outr okay so I guess we will start start

1335
01:08:27,319 --> 01:08:30,239
again we got the screen we got the

1336
01:08:28,798 --> 01:08:33,319
squirt

1337
01:08:30,238 --> 01:08:35,838
bottle we got the bucket so we're a

1338
01:08:33,319 --> 01:08:37,560
little more of a longer mix that time

1339
01:08:35,838 --> 01:08:38,880
and we did break the buds up more so it

1340
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:41,440
doesn't surprise me that there's a

1341
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:43,159
little bit more contaminant not like you

1342
01:08:41,439 --> 01:08:45,599
want to be all excited seeing this bag

1343
01:08:43,158 --> 01:08:45,599
full

1344
01:08:50,158 --> 01:08:55,798
but

1345
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:55,798
awkward 220

1346
01:08:59,238 --> 01:09:01,519
all

1347
01:09:03,039 --> 01:09:08,198
right the puddle of the

1348
01:09:05,719 --> 01:09:10,640
220 you know I'll photograph it we'll

1349
01:09:08,198 --> 01:09:10,639
see what it

1350
01:09:16,838 --> 01:09:22,359
is and I will definitely spray the [ __ ]

1351
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:25,119
out of it awesome this is the bag we do

1352
01:09:22,359 --> 01:09:26,679
not put in this bag this is definitely

1353
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:29,318
at least the bag there's usually a

1354
01:09:26,679 --> 01:09:30,880
couple of them yeah we don't often do it

1355
01:09:29,319 --> 01:09:34,759
with the next one

1356
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:36,319
either but it has happened on a river

1357
01:09:34,759 --> 01:09:38,880
yes on a

1358
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:42,400
Riv yes yes on a river no I even mean

1359
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:42,400
like on purpose like it was worth

1360
01:09:43,399 --> 01:09:48,679
it all

1361
01:09:46,238 --> 01:09:51,959
right most of the contaminant got caught

1362
01:09:48,679 --> 01:09:54,600
up in the uh in the 220 there's still a

1363
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:55,840
little bit here in the 190

1364
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:58,079
just enough

1365
01:09:55,840 --> 01:10:01,560
to just enough to make it noticeable

1366
01:09:58,079 --> 01:10:01,559
when I put all the the grades

1367
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:05,000
together

1368
01:10:07,679 --> 01:10:11,039
excellent thank you

1369
01:10:18,399 --> 01:10:27,439
sir yeah just a few little chunks pretty

1370
01:10:21,158 --> 01:10:27,439
much the same color as the bag very

1371
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:35,960
green is it

1372
01:10:36,039 --> 01:10:40,960
green little bit green little bit green

1373
01:10:39,319 --> 01:10:44,119
but you know what I when I think of the

1374
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:46,399
coconut oil this is all just

1375
01:10:44,119 --> 01:10:48,000
perfect you know there's medicine in

1376
01:10:46,399 --> 01:10:49,719
there yeah and I want to make all the

1377
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:51,399
grades of the coconut oil I don't want

1378
01:10:49,719 --> 01:10:53,800
to just do it with my worst I want to

1379
01:10:51,399 --> 01:10:58,439
take some of my 90s some of my 73 some

1380
01:10:53,800 --> 01:11:00,520
like 120 sort of experiment with uh the

1381
01:10:58,439 --> 01:11:02,759
different

1382
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:05,760
grades all right

1383
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:05,760
so

1384
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:13,880
160 a little bit

1385
01:11:11,439 --> 01:11:16,519
more tiles

1386
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:18,600
are much more substantial than last time

1387
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:20,600
but still quite small then again it

1388
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:23,039
could have been you know

1389
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:26,239
only uh well it could have been as

1390
01:11:23,039 --> 01:11:28,039
little as 40 G that I ran if you do if

1391
01:11:26,238 --> 01:11:29,439
it's sometimes it's a quarter sometimes

1392
01:11:28,039 --> 01:11:32,600
it's

1393
01:11:29,439 --> 01:11:32,599
1/5 the

1394
01:11:34,319 --> 01:11:38,920
amount and I definitely did give those a

1395
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:41,159
lot of water the other

1396
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:44,399
day might be something to experiment

1397
01:11:41,158 --> 01:11:47,638
with John what would that be uh cutting

1398
01:11:44,399 --> 01:11:50,399
down on the water about 5 days 4 days

1399
01:11:47,639 --> 01:11:52,319
before you cut your fresh frozen down

1400
01:11:50,399 --> 01:11:54,879
stress it out produce more

1401
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:59,039
resin and and

1402
01:11:54,880 --> 01:12:02,199
uh yeah potentially uh get a lot less

1403
01:11:59,039 --> 01:12:05,119
water weight in the fresh plant matter

1404
01:12:02,198 --> 01:12:05,119
because it doesn't have

1405
01:12:16,158 --> 01:12:20,759
it well we definitely um you

1406
01:12:21,679 --> 01:12:26,800
sir all right 20

1407
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:29,639
bag this is the one we're going to have

1408
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:32,230
to be careful with this is the one we're

1409
01:12:29,639 --> 01:12:33,520
going to want to be very careful

1410
01:12:32,229 --> 01:12:36,718
[Music]

1411
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:39,800
with we haven't managed to strain any of

1412
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:41,319
this bubble yet because it is just so

1413
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:42,960
it's also a very nice day so we're

1414
01:12:41,319 --> 01:12:45,279
actually working in a pretty warm

1415
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:47,079
environment I think I might end up sing

1416
01:12:45,279 --> 01:12:50,479
it all but we'll see what happens once I

1417
01:12:47,079 --> 01:12:52,439
pull there you the 120 out here thank

1418
01:12:50,479 --> 01:12:55,439
you

1419
01:12:52,439 --> 01:12:55,439
John

1420
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:17,000
definitely got a lot more

1421
01:13:17,639 --> 01:13:24,840
that yeah 100% twice as much three times

1422
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:27,279
as let say at least three times as much

1423
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:28,760
this is the 120 this could be even four

1424
01:13:27,279 --> 01:13:32,399
or five times as

1425
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:34,000
much so definitely this second run is uh

1426
01:13:32,399 --> 01:13:35,479
giving us a lot better yields after

1427
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:37,079
breaking up those buds because they were

1428
01:13:35,479 --> 01:13:38,839
just those big solid nugs that you

1429
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:41,119
showed that we showed you that we just

1430
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:44,600
threw in there just TOS right in just

1431
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:47,800
toss them right in that was the whole

1432
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:49,480
idea wanted to get the maximum since see

1433
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:52,880
and then that first would you like to

1434
01:13:49,479 --> 01:13:55,359
clean that um yeah you can dump that in

1435
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:55,359
there

1436
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:59,280
so because it is the 120 and the 120 is

1437
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,560
so nice we're just going to give it a

1438
01:13:59,279 --> 01:14:03,000
quick

1439
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:04,679
little rinse just like

1440
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:07,399
that

1441
01:14:04,679 --> 01:14:08,920
excellent next up is the 90 and you know

1442
01:14:07,399 --> 01:14:10,960
what it actually has a little bit of

1443
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:13,199
hold this time

1444
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:16,239
around after a little bit longer of a

1445
01:14:13,198 --> 01:14:16,238
mix pardon

1446
01:14:16,359 --> 01:14:21,519
me what's that bud if it's got a hole

1447
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:25,279
that means that's a good sign always a

1448
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:25,280
good sign yeah absolutely

1449
01:14:27,679 --> 01:14:32,520
little bit

1450
01:14:29,279 --> 01:14:35,880
anyway nice to see something

1451
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:35,880
there in the

1452
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:48,440
90 got a little bit on the side of the

1453
01:14:47,119 --> 01:14:51,079
bag

1454
01:14:48,439 --> 01:14:55,279
there perfect chance to use the

1455
01:14:51,079 --> 01:14:55,279
mister don't catch it back up

1456
01:14:57,119 --> 01:15:00,399
this has a real nice color to it this is

1457
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:03,319
going to look

1458
01:15:00,399 --> 01:15:07,359
surreal that's going to be

1459
01:15:03,319 --> 01:15:10,198
snot ah the definitely that's that's a

1460
01:15:07,359 --> 01:15:13,599
once again yeah I'm so much more

1461
01:15:10,198 --> 01:15:13,599
enjoying the second

1462
01:15:14,238 --> 01:15:22,198
R yes well it's always a good idea

1463
01:15:18,079 --> 01:15:25,279
top it just shows you know what I mean

1464
01:15:22,198 --> 01:15:27,759
hey we're here showing you what

1465
01:15:25,279 --> 01:15:29,800
uh well just you know what how else do

1466
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:32,760
you know how efficient you are you just

1467
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:37,159
assume well a lot of us just do assume

1468
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:39,840
so this is why we have to first don't

1469
01:15:37,158 --> 01:15:43,079
succeed R it again and I think the first

1470
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:45,800
one was a success so one is crazy that

1471
01:15:43,079 --> 01:15:48,000
will be like the first sift I think that

1472
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:51,000
is some of the most the way it just cure

1473
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:52,439
it up in there oh I know I'm excited

1474
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,880
it's like it's like first bounce with

1475
01:15:52,439 --> 01:15:56,319
dry sip that's

1476
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:58,159
it does no truly that's exactly what I'm

1477
01:15:56,319 --> 01:16:00,960
uh first bounce with fresh frozen I'm

1478
01:15:58,158 --> 01:16:04,158
feeling that I'm feeling that as well

1479
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:06,800
it's exciting making some fresh Frozen

1480
01:16:04,158 --> 01:16:06,799
with my buddy

1481
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:17,840
John little bit of contamination found

1482
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:21,639
its way in easy to get the finger in

1483
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:24,079
there and pull it out when it's that

1484
01:16:21,639 --> 01:16:26,199
small looks like a single piece but

1485
01:16:24,079 --> 01:16:28,760
there could be another oh I think I see

1486
01:16:26,198 --> 01:16:31,399
another I think I see

1487
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:34,440
another this is never a bad idea to do

1488
01:16:31,399 --> 01:16:36,719
don't you know if you can see it and you

1489
01:16:34,439 --> 01:16:39,519
can access it just get it out don't

1490
01:16:36,719 --> 01:16:41,600
think oh I'll wait till later when uh

1491
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:44,480
when it's out on the parchment or

1492
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:46,440
whatnot I already know there's only

1493
01:16:44,479 --> 01:16:49,559
three bags left CU I'm running out of

1494
01:16:46,439 --> 01:16:52,599
hooks ah

1495
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:55,080
yes that is a good way to know isn't it

1496
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:55,079
it is

1497
01:17:00,719 --> 01:17:03,000
oh

1498
01:17:06,679 --> 01:17:11,039
yeah this one's almost a bluish

1499
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:17,279
Ting oh there's a little bit of

1500
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:20,000
contaminant too always nice to be able

1501
01:17:17,279 --> 01:17:23,359
to use the spray bottle for just

1502
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:24,679
that I was looking for this healing tool

1503
01:17:23,359 --> 01:17:26,279
walk in front of I'll pull it out I'll

1504
01:17:24,679 --> 01:17:29,560
pull it out with my fingers like I just

1505
01:17:26,279 --> 01:17:32,479
grab it yeah I see that's a pretty big

1506
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:32,480
piece of whatever it

1507
01:17:33,039 --> 01:17:40,920
is there it is right there you can blow

1508
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:43,840
it right out you going blow there you

1509
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:45,800
go so definitely seeing better yields on

1510
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:50,639
the second

1511
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:53,159
round I found a a bug in the in the

1512
01:17:50,639 --> 01:17:56,920
last that wasn't a bug it was a stigma

1513
01:17:53,158 --> 01:18:00,759
hair stigma stigma stigma a capitate or

1514
01:17:56,920 --> 01:18:02,880
a pistolet sorry stigma hair all right

1515
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:06,159
so this is our

1516
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:09,440
73 we certainly did up our yield by many

1517
01:18:06,158 --> 01:18:12,279
many times I'm anticipating this 45 is

1518
01:18:09,439 --> 01:18:14,198
going to be like two and a half

1519
01:18:12,279 --> 01:18:15,479
minutes yeah I know it's not going to

1520
01:18:14,198 --> 01:18:16,839
fit on the pressing screen I'll tell you

1521
01:18:15,479 --> 01:18:19,439
that much that's what I'm looking at we

1522
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:22,199
already know that so as looking here now

1523
01:18:19,439 --> 01:18:24,279
we're definitely seeing uh twice as much

1524
01:18:22,198 --> 01:18:27,439
as our last one so we're getting upwards

1525
01:18:24,279 --> 01:18:29,399
of uh it's twice as much right now yeah

1526
01:18:27,439 --> 01:18:33,039
before I pull this bag which will

1527
01:18:29,399 --> 01:18:33,039
probably make it three times as

1528
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:38,400
much and this is the great thing with

1529
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:40,079
water extraction if you feel the need to

1530
01:18:38,399 --> 01:18:42,638
just keep running your material there's

1531
01:18:40,079 --> 01:18:44,600
no one you'll know when the quality is

1532
01:18:42,639 --> 01:18:47,319
down it's not like you just want to keep

1533
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:49,480
getting you want to get quality right

1534
01:18:47,319 --> 01:18:52,158
now we're pulling

1535
01:18:49,479 --> 01:18:54,919
quality you know I I could probably even

1536
01:18:52,158 --> 01:18:54,920
do a third one

1537
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:59,199
yeah but I'm going to do the coconut oil

1538
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:00,719
so but doing the coconut oil is just

1539
01:18:59,198 --> 01:19:03,439
going to be our method so some people

1540
01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:05,158
might coconut oil exactly but it is a

1541
01:19:03,439 --> 01:19:08,559
great way to get this stuff into your

1542
01:19:05,158 --> 01:19:08,559
body just eat

1543
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:20,800
it all right here we there we

1544
01:19:16,359 --> 01:19:24,079
go big 45 that Weir have the bags out

1545
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:25,760
there we go come on

1546
01:19:24,079 --> 01:19:29,920
was being a bit

1547
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:32,440
weird holding the goods here nice 45

1548

beautiful spray that up beautiful

1549
01:19:32,439 --> 01:19:36,879
beautiful oh a little bit of contam

1550
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:40,600
there now she's

1551
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:45,079
gone but yeah I'm I'm seeing yeah the 45

1552
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:48,760
is just the watermelon loving the 45 oh

1553
01:19:45,079 --> 01:19:51,279
yeah could be that sativa in

1554
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:53,600
there cuz that looks

1555
01:19:51,279 --> 01:19:55,279
creepy that look Beau

1556
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:57,320
oh

1557
01:19:55,279 --> 01:19:59,719
yeah yeah I guess we better give them a

1558
01:19:57,319 --> 01:20:02,559
little s sight here I think that's about

1559
01:19:59,719 --> 01:20:02,560
three G

1560
01:20:04,238 --> 01:20:12,678
there even more maybe

1561
01:20:07,719 --> 01:20:16,359
yeah a nice a nice yield for a small

1562
01:20:12,679 --> 01:20:18,560
fresh frozen frozen batch for one plant

1563
01:20:16,359 --> 01:20:21,158
you know we we're looking at maybe

1564
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:21,159
getting another

1565
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:25,199
screen

1566
01:20:23,399 --> 01:20:28,158
well we will yeah we're going to put

1567
01:20:25,198 --> 01:20:30,399
that right into a CER right now and just

1568
01:20:28,158 --> 01:20:30,399
hash

1569
01:20:36,238 --> 01:20:41,678
it

1570
01:20:38,039 --> 01:20:43,279
woo so that's a nice little pile guys

1571
01:20:41,679 --> 01:20:45,199
yeah this is a real nice pile yeah

1572
01:20:43,279 --> 01:20:46,639
definitely um excited decent yield this

1573
01:20:45,198 --> 01:20:49,638
is the kind of yield you get off of when

1574
01:20:46,639 --> 01:20:53,639
you run uh like a couple hundred

1575
01:20:49,639 --> 01:20:56,279
GRS of of dry material oh nice big fat

1576
01:20:53,639 --> 01:20:58,480
45 like that but that's surprising to

1577
01:20:56,279 --> 01:20:58,479
get it

1578
01:20:59,719 --> 01:21:03,639
out what were you going to eat it I was

1579
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:05,079
s in the B man I got to you know what I

1580
01:21:03,639 --> 01:21:07,159
got to treat this guy better the next

1581
01:21:05,079 --> 01:21:09,479
time I have a spoon full of resin he's

1582
01:21:07,158 --> 01:21:11,439
eating it you know what he's eating it I

1583
01:21:09,479 --> 01:21:14,439
got to feed this guy's endoc canabo

1584
01:21:11,439 --> 01:21:18,359
system he's working overtime all the

1585
01:21:14,439 --> 01:21:21,638
time so I much appreciate it thank

1586
01:21:18,359 --> 01:21:25,399
sir 25

1587
01:21:21,639 --> 01:21:25,400
micron it's water

1588
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:36,080
steady lifting the water allows or

1589
01:21:34,158 --> 01:21:37,799
lifting the water with the resin allows

1590
01:21:36,079 --> 01:21:40,359
the water to push down and fit through

1591
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:44,239
the screen without being

1592
01:21:40,359 --> 01:21:47,519
blocked much quicker way

1593
01:21:44,238 --> 01:21:49,079
of draining the bag you don't want to

1594
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:51,360
wait for this to happen you want to help

1595
01:21:49,079 --> 01:21:51,359
it

1596
01:21:51,639 --> 01:21:54,639
happen

1597
01:21:55,158 --> 01:22:00,119
I think the best part about this is we

1598
01:21:57,079 --> 01:22:02,800
cut down that plant at around lunchtime

1599
01:22:00,119 --> 01:22:05,158
and here we are getting close to dinner

1600
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:06,639
and I think we might even do a hit off

1601
01:22:05,158 --> 01:22:09,439
of

1602
01:22:06,639 --> 01:22:12,119
it so

1603
01:22:09,439 --> 01:22:13,960
um you can't crop your weed and dry it

1604
01:22:12,119 --> 01:22:19,158
and get it all run in one day that's for

1605
01:22:13,960 --> 01:22:22,079
sure nope this way look at the 25 look

1606
01:22:19,158 --> 01:22:24,039
at how nice and white it is there's a

1607
01:22:22,079 --> 01:22:26,079
lot of it

1608
01:22:24,039 --> 01:22:28,399
I'm going to squeeze that over here the

1609
01:22:26,079 --> 01:22:31,439
25 I find is the one you really don't

1610
01:22:28,399 --> 01:22:35,238
need the spray bottle for it's like Silk

1611
01:22:31,439 --> 01:22:35,238
the spoon moves it around

1612
01:22:36,158 --> 01:22:43,158
perfect the

1613
01:22:38,238 --> 01:22:43,158
silkiness the silky 25 silky

1614
01:22:48,039 --> 01:22:51,039
25

1615
01:22:51,198 --> 01:22:55,359
well we definitely have

1616
01:22:56,000 --> 01:23:00,840
uh

1617
01:22:57,880 --> 01:23:04,359
pulled uh by looking at there there's

1618
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:04,360
there's spoon for

1619
01:23:07,880 --> 01:23:12,039
John all right excuse me

1620
01:23:12,779 --> 01:23:15,920
[Music]

1621
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:20,760
what

1622
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:26,800
see this here alone should be a drink in

1623
01:23:24,198 --> 01:23:29,559
your local store

1624
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:33,159
someday the flavor is amazing it's like

1625
01:23:29,560 --> 01:23:36,320
a Kool-Aid that you've never tried

1626
01:23:33,158 --> 01:23:37,719
before it's so good it's nice I really

1627
01:23:36,319 --> 01:23:42,238
enjoy

1628
01:23:37,719 --> 01:23:45,639
it bubble bubble a bubble a bubble

1629
01:23:42,238 --> 01:23:47,519
a I mean this would probably go for like

1630
01:23:45,639 --> 01:23:51,480
$50 a

1631
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:53,280
bottle yeah you can get it here for

1632
01:23:51,479 --> 01:23:54,718
free

1633
01:23:53,279 --> 01:23:58,960
yeah this did the same thing this is

1634
01:23:54,719 --> 01:24:00,960
snot done s it up sealed awesome um

1635
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:02,600
let's show them what it looks like okay

1636
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:05,800
and then uh we'll take the camera we're

1637
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:05,800
going to show you guys what that looks

1638
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:19,679
like so here's our 220 190 160 120

1639
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:19,679
9073 45

1640
01:24:21,359 --> 01:24:25,759
25

1641
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:28,679
look at that

1642
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:33,000
45 it's

1643
01:24:28,679 --> 01:24:36,920
nice so I guess freeze them up get the

1644
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:38,719
seeve out or the uh microplane I should

1645
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:41,480
say we're going to be microplaning this

1646
01:24:38,719 --> 01:24:44,480
PCH there you go you want to spin that

1647
01:24:41,479 --> 01:24:44,479
uh around a few

1648
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:54,359
times this is how we dry our bags is it

1649
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:54,360
tightening that's awesome

1650
01:25:02,039 --> 01:25:05,840
so just to add finally that we've

1651
01:25:03,960 --> 01:25:08,359
cleaned the machine out the bubble now

1652
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:10,880
machine is all cleaned out and rinsed

1653
01:25:08,359 --> 01:25:12,920
bag's all Nic and cleaned the all screen

1654
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:14,520
bubble nail bag is is nice and clean

1655
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:17,600
we've separated the

1656
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:21,080
ice from the plant matter so this was

1657
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:22,800
the 250 fresh I'll dry it out and I'll

1658
01:25:21,079 --> 01:25:25,600
let you guys know what it was

1659
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:29,639
um in regards to dry weight and I'll

1660
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:32,239
also um microplane uh the resin was just

1661
01:25:29,639 --> 01:25:34,400
too sticky to uh be able to see that

1662
01:25:32,238 --> 01:25:36,439
especially with the warmer temperatures

1663
01:25:34,399 --> 01:25:38,439
it's pretty much snot yeah it's pretty

1664
01:25:36,439 --> 01:25:40,599
snotty so um I'm not sure if I'm going

1665
01:25:38,439 --> 01:25:42,079
to do it tonight or not pro probably and

1666
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:43,800
I'll make sure I set up the camera when

1667
01:25:42,079 --> 01:25:46,039
I do that just going to be simply

1668
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:49,159
microplaning it onto each cardboard uh

1669
01:25:46,039 --> 01:25:51,238
Pizza Box on top of the parchment paper

1670
01:25:49,158 --> 01:25:53,638
and then I'll stack them and uh probably

1671
01:25:51,238 --> 01:25:56,039
photograph it with the m macro lens nice

1672
01:25:53,639 --> 01:25:58,400
do some melt videos there and this video

1673
01:25:56,039 --> 01:26:00,719
will be complete I'm coming back for the

1674
01:25:58,399 --> 01:26:02,559
Melt video oh of course yeah absolutely

1675
01:26:00,719 --> 01:26:04,279
I will make a point on not smoking this

1676
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:06,280
hash until I smoke it with I'm going to

1677
01:26:04,279 --> 01:26:09,238
sleep downstairs and put the coton just

1678
01:26:06,279 --> 01:26:11,198
to make sure yes excellent good call

1679
01:26:09,238 --> 01:26:14,559
good call you know I'm a

1680
01:26:11,198 --> 01:26:17,678
very shady kind of character

1681
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:19,639
so so we got our uh our water that we

1682
01:26:17,679 --> 01:26:20,800
used our tarpine Rich water you know you

1683
01:26:19,639 --> 01:26:23,199
can do what you want with this some

1684
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:24,719
people claim uh they they praise feeding

1685
01:26:23,198 --> 01:26:26,839
the plants with it I think today that's

1686
01:26:24,719 --> 01:26:28,439
what I'm going to do give my plants a

1687
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:31,279
little bit of uh a little bit of this

1688
01:26:28,439 --> 01:26:32,960
bubble water um it is quite cold so I'm

1689
01:26:31,279 --> 01:26:34,559
going to let it warm up a little bit

1690
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:36,840
before I give it to the plants probably

1691
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:41,119
I'll give it to them tomorrow uh in the

1692
01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:43,440
morning nice yeah so loving this uh

1693
01:26:41,118 --> 01:26:45,479
bubble bag uh

1694
01:26:43,439 --> 01:26:49,919
wheel very

1695
01:26:45,479 --> 01:26:51,399
cool we'll uh see see you guys at the

1696
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:53,440
next step yeah happy hash making that

1697
01:26:51,399 --> 01:26:56,359
was a long day medicated

1698
01:26:53,439 --> 01:26:58,359
Pizza major bowls beforehand major bowls

1699
01:26:56,359 --> 01:27:01,039
during and after um we're going to do

1700
01:26:58,359 --> 01:27:02,479
major bowls now I suspect and uh I guess

1701
01:27:01,039 --> 01:27:05,560
we'll see whether or not we're going to

1702
01:27:02,479 --> 01:27:06,839
do that um that micro planing you go

1703
01:27:05,560 --> 01:27:08,840
yeah I'm kind of interested in seeing

1704
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:10,600
what we got cuz after actually doing the

1705
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:13,199
first and the second run I'd say what

1706
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:15,159
our yields are well I don't know I'm not

1707
01:27:13,198 --> 01:27:16,839
going to jump out there but by just by

1708
01:27:15,158 --> 01:27:18,799
looking at what's seen there and stuff

1709
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:21,440
like that you know you pushing probably

1710
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:24,440
you know anywhere from 7 to 10 I'd say

1711
01:27:21,439 --> 01:27:26,000
we got probably around 7 G which is not

1712
01:27:24,439 --> 01:27:28,919
too bad when you think that was a

1713
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:31,238
smaller plant I only had six of them in

1714
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:34,000
the tent the tent could have easily fit

1715
01:27:31,238 --> 01:27:36,158
10 of them I'd say at least eight one

1716
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:37,800
plant yeah one plant and we actually we

1717
01:27:36,158 --> 01:27:39,599
don't even know say you did seven yeah

1718
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:41,679
exactly we're guesstimating but it it's

1719
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:45,119
a neat idea of what we're doing we're

1720
01:27:41,679 --> 01:27:47,079
focused on how much resin that we got

1721
01:27:45,118 --> 01:27:48,920
and the profile of that resin I'm not

1722
01:27:47,079 --> 01:27:51,359
worried about the yields but I love the

1723
01:27:48,920 --> 01:27:53,359
idea of sharing with you guys how much a

1724
01:27:51,359 --> 01:27:55,399
plant yielded not in vegetative weight

1725
01:27:53,359 --> 01:27:57,439
first but resin and then we'll let you

1726
01:27:55,399 --> 01:27:59,238
know the veg numbers we'll make you go

1727
01:27:57,439 --> 01:28:01,319
through and do the math and you'll start

1728
01:27:59,238 --> 01:28:04,039
understanding the value of the plant is

1729
01:28:01,319 --> 01:28:09,079
in the resin not in the diluted plant

1730
01:28:04,039 --> 01:28:10,600
matter so there it is awesome okay well

1731
01:28:09,079 --> 01:28:13,198
M planning up

1732
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:16,920
next okay just to show you one last

1733
01:28:13,198 --> 01:28:18,919
thing um I got all the ice put away and

1734
01:28:16,920 --> 01:28:21,520
frozen in the freezer so I can use that

1735
01:28:18,920 --> 01:28:22,960
ice again um I took all the plant matter

1736
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:25,360
out of the pl plastic bag and I've

1737
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:28,480
actually got it inside this pizza box

1738
01:28:25,359 --> 01:28:31,118
right now so this is the bud that I ran

1739
01:28:28,479 --> 01:28:33,319
the whole plant I'm going to uh dry it

1740
01:28:31,118 --> 01:28:35,759
out and I'll weigh it and then I've got

1741
01:28:33,319 --> 01:28:39,679
a coconut um extraction that I'm going

1742
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:42,400
to do so I'll show you guys that and uh

1743
01:28:39,679 --> 01:28:44,118
yeah pretty stoked on all of this I'll

1744
01:28:42,399 --> 01:28:46,399
uh show you what's up on the microp

1745
01:28:44,118 --> 01:28:46,399
plane

1746
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:51,600
next hey guys welcome to Bubble man's

1747
01:28:49,158 --> 01:28:54,158
world the final stage here after

1748
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:56,840
whipping off a fresh batch of uh fresh

1749
01:28:54,158 --> 01:28:59,719
frozen Astro Boy with John yesterday um

1750
01:28:56,840 --> 01:29:02,639
I did leave the hash in the freezer it

1751
01:28:59,719 --> 01:29:04,920
seemingly some of it won't even freeze I

1752
01:29:02,639 --> 01:29:07,319
I pull it off the the uh pressing screen

1753
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:10,440
and it's just the goopi I'm so excited

1754
01:29:07,319 --> 01:29:13,840
to get this hash broken up so um we got

1755
01:29:10,439 --> 01:29:16,359
small amounts uh maybe four or five g

1756
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:18,319
once all said and done we'll see but uh

1757
01:29:16,359 --> 01:29:21,519
I'm going to get I've got our boxes here

1758
01:29:18,319 --> 01:29:25,799
you can see that each box is marked with

1759
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:26,840
a mic on and each box is lined with

1760
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:29,719
parchment

1761
01:29:26,840 --> 01:29:31,760
paper so we'll keep all the parchment

1762
01:29:29,719 --> 01:29:35,920
folks out there happy all the anti-c

1763
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:41,079
cardb boarders but I can still use my

1764
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:44,960
cardboard all right so I've got some ice

1765
01:29:41,079 --> 01:29:46,719
packs here these are cryle pack they

1766
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:48,679
don't leak they don't produce moisture

1767
01:29:46,719 --> 01:29:50,000
on the outside they're [ __ ] awesome

1768
01:29:48,679 --> 01:29:51,440
and then I've got another one here that

1769
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:54,880
it's sitting on as well this one's a

1770
01:29:51,439 --> 01:29:57,479
paramedic this one gets hot and cold and

1771
01:29:54,880 --> 01:30:00,039
uh yeah just nice to have the hash

1772
01:29:57,479 --> 01:30:02,718
pushed between the

1773
01:30:00,039 --> 01:30:07,960
two and I think we're going to

1774
01:30:02,719 --> 01:30:09,198
start with the 220 actually let's get

1775
01:30:07,960 --> 01:30:13,319
our gloves

1776
01:30:09,198 --> 01:30:15,919
on always nice to protect the

1777
01:30:13,319 --> 01:30:17,158
hands from the resin you got to be

1778
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:19,158
careful when you're wearing gloves and

1779
01:30:17,158 --> 01:30:22,479
you're microplaning that you don't get

1780
01:30:19,158 --> 01:30:24,399
too close to the planer um and PL off

1781
01:30:22,479 --> 01:30:28,319
any of the

1782
01:30:24,399 --> 01:30:28,319
plastic so this is our

1783
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:35,960
220 breaking up quite nice cuz it really

1784
01:30:32,920 --> 01:30:37,880
is just mostly

1785
01:30:35,960 --> 01:30:40,840
contaminant there's going to be a little

1786
01:30:37,880 --> 01:30:44,159
bit of resin in there but not too much

1787
01:30:40,840 --> 01:30:49,279
not really too too worried

1788
01:30:44,158 --> 01:30:49,279
about how that works out

1789
01:30:50,840 --> 01:30:55,800
okay

1790
01:30:53,238 --> 01:31:00,279
excellent so couple of little chunks

1791
01:30:55,800 --> 01:31:00,279
with the 220 not too

1792
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:11,159
worried so 220 190 160

1793
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:12,719
120 90 73 45 25 okay so we can throw

1794
01:31:11,158 --> 01:31:16,599
these into here as

1795
01:31:12,719 --> 01:31:16,600
well these little guys

1796
01:31:20,760 --> 01:31:23,760
here

1797
01:31:25,639 --> 01:31:31,920
all right there's that

1798
01:31:27,279 --> 01:31:33,800
190 very small piles on these almost uh

1799
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:36,319
almost nothing there at

1800
01:31:33,800 --> 01:31:38,639
all but it's what we got so we're going

1801
01:31:36,319 --> 01:31:38,639
to run

1802
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:44,960
it I'll just add that I did freeze the

1803
01:31:42,399 --> 01:31:47,719
microplane it does help to have this

1804
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:47,719
thing as cold as

1805
01:31:48,359 --> 01:31:53,359
possible okay

1806
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:55,639
so

1807
01:31:53,359 --> 01:31:59,880
we've got our 190

1808
01:31:55,639 --> 01:31:59,880
160 and we're going to go next up to

1809
01:32:03,158 --> 01:32:08,479
120 it's a good sign it's cracking I

1810
01:32:06,158 --> 01:32:08,479
hear it

1811
01:32:11,399 --> 01:32:16,638
peeling almost immediately I feel it

1812
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:20,000
stick to my

1813
01:32:16,639 --> 01:32:25,118
fingers that is some nice

1814
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:25,118
hash loses its cold really

1815
01:32:25,880 --> 01:32:31,960
fast man can you smell the goodness woo

1816
01:32:29,679 --> 01:32:31,960
tell

1817
01:32:32,359 --> 01:32:37,479
you been a while since I actually made

1818
01:32:34,920 --> 01:32:39,880
some fresh frozen that's

1819
01:32:37,479 --> 01:32:43,000
just just all going to stay here I'm so

1820
01:32:39,880 --> 01:32:43,000
used to making it for my

1821
01:32:43,039 --> 01:32:48,479
friends never a bad idea to give the

1822
01:32:45,399 --> 01:32:53,638
micop plane of whack to give it a

1823
01:32:48,479 --> 01:32:53,638
clean nice small amount of 120

1824
01:32:53,840 --> 01:32:59,719
now you got to see how easy it is to

1825
01:32:56,639 --> 01:33:02,440
have the bubble in the pizza box line it

1826
01:32:59,719 --> 01:33:05,000
with parchment close it up the the the

1827
01:33:02,439 --> 01:33:07,519
the desicant of cardboard will work

1828
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:10,158
without even touching just having that

1829
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:13,840
moisture getting pulled out from the

1830
01:33:10,158 --> 01:33:17,599
whole full uh covered

1831
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:20,079
cardboard so this one's the

1832
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:23,560
90 this one we're going to stand up for

1833
01:33:20,079 --> 01:33:23,559
get a little more serious

1834
01:33:31,960 --> 01:33:38,560
oh yeah starting to starting to stick

1835
01:33:36,359 --> 01:33:38,559
right

1836
01:33:41,158 --> 01:33:46,559
away so sometimes when the when the

1837
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:49,920
resin starts to stick especially with

1838
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:52,880
this particular microplan you can just

1839
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:54,079
gently bring it over the microplane and

1840
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:56,600
you can

1841
01:33:54,079 --> 01:33:59,679
actually when you think All Is Lost and

1842
01:33:56,600 --> 01:34:02,920
all is hopeless you can still get that

1843
01:33:59,679 --> 01:34:05,560
resin broken up that's not too bad I got

1844
01:34:02,920 --> 01:34:08,279
a little bit on my

1845
01:34:05,560 --> 01:34:10,840
fingers it's uh it did lose a little bit

1846
01:34:08,279 --> 01:34:14,000
of its

1847
01:34:10,840 --> 01:34:16,520
uh I'll be able to freeze that and pull

1848
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:19,359
that resin off no

1849
01:34:16,520 --> 01:34:22,000
problem I have a nice light microplane

1850
01:34:19,359 --> 01:34:24,639
this one is just called microplane um

1851
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:27,399
the bumps are very small it doesn't rip

1852
01:34:24,639 --> 01:34:28,600
the plastic it doesn't shred My Fingers

1853
01:34:27,399 --> 01:34:30,079
um you do want to pay attention

1854
01:34:28,600 --> 01:34:32,760
depending on what kind of microplane you

1855
01:34:30,079 --> 01:34:34,000
do have because some of them will shred

1856
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:38,480
shred your

1857
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:38,479
fingers all right so there's our

1858
01:34:40,819 --> 01:34:45,920
[Music]

1859
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:47,800
90 and I'm going to do a quick refreeze

1860
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:50,480
of the material because I find that it's

1861
01:34:47,800 --> 01:34:54,119
getting a little bit

1862
01:34:50,479 --> 01:34:57,559
warm and uh we'll be back to uh

1863
01:34:54,118 --> 01:34:59,920
microplane the 73 the 45 and the 25 and

1864
01:34:57,560 --> 01:35:02,880
then we'll get it all put away I'll add

1865
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:04,679
some photographs of the final material

1866
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:07,440
and uh hopefully we'll do some melt

1867
01:35:04,679 --> 01:35:09,079
videos and we'll just keep on uh

1868
01:35:07,439 --> 01:35:12,519
processing the plants out of my garden I

1869
01:35:09,079 --> 01:35:15,800
have two more Astro boys I have um a

1870
01:35:12,520 --> 01:35:17,239
baba chm and I have a medic Kush uh as

1871
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:20,119
well as the My Little Pony but that's

1872
01:35:17,238 --> 01:35:23,919
still uh quite a ways from being done so

1873
01:35:20,118 --> 01:35:26,839
we will get back soon here all right so

1874
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:29,520
I refroze the hash this is going to

1875
01:35:26,840 --> 01:35:31,039
happen often when you're when you're

1876
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:34,000
doing microp

1877
01:35:31,039 --> 01:35:36,079
planting um so we got number 73 next up

1878
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:39,800
to

1879
01:35:36,079 --> 01:35:41,279
that great sound of that coming off

1880
01:35:39,800 --> 01:35:46,199
quite

1881
01:35:41,279 --> 01:35:46,198
proper and they're nice thin patties so

1882
01:35:50,399 --> 01:35:56,839
they're oh there we go that got me

1883
01:35:53,920 --> 01:35:58,880
about I think I was microplaning for

1884
01:35:56,840 --> 01:36:00,000
about 4 seconds before the hash decided

1885
01:35:58,880 --> 01:36:02,679
to turn

1886
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:04,719
into a nightmare to work

1887
01:36:02,679 --> 01:36:06,960
with that's

1888
01:36:04,719 --> 01:36:09,399
okay long as you can get it broken into

1889
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:12,679
smaller pieces you're you're okay I I

1890
01:36:09,399 --> 01:36:15,039
really do prefer my seeve but I made a

1891
01:36:12,679 --> 01:36:18,880
mistake with this hash in the sense that

1892
01:36:15,039 --> 01:36:22,560
I allowed it to sit for a little bit too

1893
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:25,719
long and it just gums

1894
01:36:22,560 --> 01:36:25,719
I've never actually

1895
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:33,079
uh produce resin of this level myself

1896
01:36:31,279 --> 01:36:36,198
but I haven't been doing this for 20

1897
01:36:33,079 --> 01:36:37,880
years so reminds me of some very well-

1898
01:36:36,198 --> 01:36:38,799
grown resin I'll tell you that much that

1899
01:36:37,880 --> 01:36:41,440
fresh

1900
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:44,679
frozen

1901
01:36:41,439 --> 01:36:44,678
really all

1902
01:36:48,198 --> 01:36:52,960
right tap make sure you're not losing

1903
01:36:50,679 --> 01:36:54,960
any resin

1904
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:56,520
other than what I've managed to lose on

1905
01:36:54,960 --> 01:36:59,480
my glove there which I'll be able to

1906
01:36:56,520 --> 01:37:01,280
crack and snap that right off never a

1907
01:36:59,479 --> 01:37:04,359
worry

1908
01:37:01,279 --> 01:37:06,840
there can always get it

1909
01:37:04,359 --> 01:37:09,559
off it's also a good idea why we wear

1910
01:37:06,840 --> 01:37:12,440
the gloves if this was on my fingers it

1911
01:37:09,560 --> 01:37:14,840
would be a super

1912
01:37:12,439 --> 01:37:17,519
nightmare all right number

1913
01:37:14,840 --> 01:37:20,199
73 sealed and

1914
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:25,040
dealed last but certainly not least we

1915
01:37:20,198 --> 01:37:27,759
have our 45 and our 25 so our 45 is a

1916
01:37:25,039 --> 01:37:30,760
real nice Patty came out real solid and

1917
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:33,679
lovely fairly thick it should hopefully

1918
01:37:30,760 --> 01:37:33,679
microplane out

1919
01:37:37,639 --> 01:37:42,760
nice this microplane

1920
01:37:40,479 --> 01:37:47,238
is

1921
01:37:42,760 --> 01:37:47,239
definitely gummed up but

1922
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:53,360
working this is usually more along the

1923
01:37:50,439 --> 01:37:57,118
lines of how microplaning Works those

1924
01:37:53,359 --> 01:37:58,759
other resins are just insanely sticky

1925
01:37:57,118 --> 01:38:01,399
this one's actually allowing me to grip

1926
01:37:58,760 --> 01:38:06,199
the 45 and really grind it

1927
01:38:01,399 --> 01:38:09,439
down and you can see that it is and can

1928
01:38:06,198 --> 01:38:11,879
be a bit of a messy messy

1929
01:38:09,439 --> 01:38:13,879
job the microplane is going to need a

1930
01:38:11,880 --> 01:38:15,480
good amount of cleaning after this I'll

1931
01:38:13,880 --> 01:38:18,480
tell

1932
01:38:15,479 --> 01:38:20,118
you all right get those pieces as small

1933
01:38:18,479 --> 01:38:22,118
as we

1934
01:38:20,118 --> 01:38:24,000
can

1935
01:38:22,118 --> 01:38:25,479
ah clean cleans the microplane up real

1936
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:27,599
nice when you give it that little whack

1937
01:38:25,479 --> 01:38:31,158
it's it's always the same you kind of

1938
01:38:27,599 --> 01:38:33,119
feel that uhoh I gummed it up it's all

1939
01:38:31,158 --> 01:38:36,198
rued it's not going to come

1940
01:38:33,118 --> 01:38:38,759
out just get it cold give it a good

1941
01:38:36,198 --> 01:38:42,719
whack it'll come

1942
01:38:38,760 --> 01:38:42,719
out this is filling up

1943
01:38:43,359 --> 01:38:48,880
nicely I'd say I'm definitely close to

1944
01:38:46,118 --> 01:38:53,118
having to clean this thing cuz it's

1945
01:38:48,880 --> 01:38:53,118
barely planing at this point

1946
01:38:58,039 --> 01:39:00,359
all

1947
01:39:01,479 --> 01:39:05,519
right little reverse planing there

1948
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:08,400
coming in through the bottom of the

1949
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:12,599
plane wherever I can access

1950
01:39:08,399 --> 01:39:12,598
the little bit pieces of bent

1951
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:17,679
metal and generally if I can like I've

1952
01:39:16,079 --> 01:39:19,039
mentioned a few times I'll try to leave

1953
01:39:17,679 --> 01:39:20,440
the right amount of moisture and if I

1954
01:39:19,039 --> 01:39:21,560
have the time and the temperature's

1955
01:39:20,439 --> 01:39:23,118
right

1956
01:39:21,560 --> 01:39:26,320
it really was that it was too warm

1957
01:39:23,118 --> 01:39:30,118
yesterday we had about 14 or 15° uh

1958
01:39:26,319 --> 01:39:33,759
Celsius which must be around 70 or 75

1959
01:39:30,118 --> 01:39:36,399
Fahrenheit just warm enough to to make

1960
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:40,239
some problems with the with the

1961
01:39:36,399 --> 01:39:42,638
hash this is the last real part once you

1962
01:39:40,238 --> 01:39:44,678
can get it into

1963
01:39:42,639 --> 01:39:46,639
this you

1964
01:39:44,679 --> 01:39:49,158
know that your hash is going to be

1965
01:39:46,639 --> 01:39:51,599
drying properly and that's a good thing

1966
01:39:49,158 --> 01:39:54,839
to know once you've you know grown a

1967
01:39:51,599 --> 01:39:57,239
plant for several months process the

1968
01:39:54,840 --> 01:40:00,000
whole thing live no

1969
01:39:57,238 --> 01:40:03,158
trimming it's nice to know that uh

1970
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:03,158
you're doing it as right as you

1971
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:12,960
can all right I think we're

1972
01:40:09,960 --> 01:40:12,960
good

1973
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:21,520
45 and our 25 which

1974
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:23,560
I you know

1975
01:40:21,520 --> 01:40:26,719
because it's such a thin

1976
01:40:23,560 --> 01:40:29,039
Patty it'll probably go into medibles

1977
01:40:26,719 --> 01:40:31,719
and I've just used all the room for the

1978
01:40:29,039 --> 01:40:34,359
one that I had for 25 and 45 I'll just

1979
01:40:31,719 --> 01:40:37,079
place that right down on there it's the

1980
01:40:34,359 --> 01:40:40,158
one patty I've actually believed could

1981
01:40:37,079 --> 01:40:42,079
potentially dry without breaking it all

1982
01:40:40,158 --> 01:40:44,279
up now I don't suggest doing it but if

1983
01:40:42,079 --> 01:40:46,719
you have to do it it's not the end of

1984
01:40:44,279 --> 01:40:49,559
the world um it's going to it's going to

1985
01:40:46,719 --> 01:40:52,439
still turn out fine um you can still use

1986
01:40:49,560 --> 01:40:53,880
it it's still medicinal and uh yeah I

1987
01:40:52,439 --> 01:40:57,118
mean if you if you have the space in the

1988
01:40:53,880 --> 01:40:59,480
room great idea to break it all up if

1989
01:40:57,118 --> 01:41:01,880
you don't the 25 micron is the one you

1990
01:40:59,479 --> 01:41:04,718
can kind of get away with without

1991
01:41:01,880 --> 01:41:08,118
worrying about uh without worrying about

1992
01:41:04,719 --> 01:41:10,319
potential moisture problems so there it

1993
01:41:08,118 --> 01:41:12,799
is nicely

1994
01:41:10,319 --> 01:41:14,439
microplaned uh spread not quite as thin

1995
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:15,599
as I like to I did get a little bit more

1996
01:41:14,439 --> 01:41:19,198
here than I would have I could have

1997
01:41:15,599 --> 01:41:22,920
spread more out this way but

1998
01:41:19,198 --> 01:41:26,118
uh it is on the parchment it is sealed

1999
01:41:22,920 --> 01:41:33,719
in the box and just like that I've got

2000
01:41:26,118 --> 01:41:36,719
my 220 190 160 120 90 73 45 and 25 all

2001
01:41:33,719 --> 01:41:40,800
microplaned up and

2002
01:41:36,719 --> 01:41:42,319
all easily held in a hand you can place

2003
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:43,920
these wherever you want in your house

2004
01:41:42,319 --> 01:41:46,279
they're not going to be getting dirt or

2005
01:41:43,920 --> 01:41:47,880
dust dog hair they're not going to be

2006
01:41:46,279 --> 01:41:52,519
getting knocked over by

2007
01:41:47,880 --> 01:41:55,239
children these are easily to to put away

2008
01:41:52,520 --> 01:41:56,719
and to leave and to allow to dry um the

2009
01:41:55,238 --> 01:41:58,919
humidity is fairly High here we're

2010
01:41:56,719 --> 01:42:01,520
probably looking at about 35

2011
01:41:58,920 --> 01:42:04,800
40% I'll get these into a room that is

2012
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:06,960
about 30% humidity I have a dehumidifier

2013
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:09,360
downstairs and I have the room sitting

2014
01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:12,158
at about because it's in the coldest

2015
01:42:09,359 --> 01:42:15,880
part of my house it's probably around 60

2016
01:42:12,158 --> 01:42:18,039
65° Fen right now so that's where this

2017
01:42:15,880 --> 01:42:20,279
stuff's going uh thank you guys for

2018
01:42:18,039 --> 01:42:21,599
watching this is the first of of of my

2019
01:42:20,279 --> 01:42:23,920
garden I'm I'm going to be running all

2020
01:42:21,599 --> 01:42:27,239
my plants so stay tuned this was the

2021
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:29,760
first Astro Boy and I'm drawing the the

2022
01:42:27,238 --> 01:42:31,439
Cannabis right now I do believe it's

2023
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:34,079
going to be less than a couple of ounces

2024
01:42:31,439 --> 01:42:35,839
it looks you know it barely fits uh

2025
01:42:34,079 --> 01:42:37,599
fills the inside of the pizza box and

2026
01:42:35,840 --> 01:42:40,400
even today it was shrunk down quite a

2027
01:42:37,599 --> 01:42:41,760
bit more so it makes it our assumptions

2028
01:42:40,399 --> 01:42:42,960
of the higher yield that we thought we

2029
01:42:41,760 --> 01:42:45,320
were going to get there's that

2030
01:42:42,960 --> 01:42:47,760
prohibition based mindset sneaking in

2031
01:42:45,319 --> 01:42:48,759
even with me and John um always thinking

2032
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:50,840
that oh we're going to get this much

2033
01:42:48,760 --> 01:42:52,360
we're going to get that much you will

2034
01:42:50,840 --> 01:42:54,079
get what's there if you know you're

2035
01:42:52,359 --> 01:42:55,920
efficient and you know the job that

2036
01:42:54,079 --> 01:42:58,840
you're doing you know how to do it you

2037
01:42:55,920 --> 01:43:00,599
will get what's there so the final thing

2038
01:42:58,840 --> 01:43:01,960
I'm going to show you on all of this is

2039
01:43:00,599 --> 01:43:04,279
I'm going to show you some macro

2040
01:43:01,960 --> 01:43:06,000
photographs of the final product I want

2041
01:43:04,279 --> 01:43:09,800
to show you some melt videos of the

2042
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:11,560
final product and uh then we're going to

2043
01:43:09,800 --> 01:43:13,159
I guess these will be separate parts

2044
01:43:11,560 --> 01:43:16,039
from this video this is the final part

2045
01:43:13,158 --> 01:43:19,158
of this video um the next video I'm

2046
01:43:16,039 --> 01:43:20,519
going to show uh coconut oil extraction

2047
01:43:19,158 --> 01:43:22,559
I'm going to take the material that I

2048
01:43:20,520 --> 01:43:25,440
have have wrap it in a

2049
01:43:22,560 --> 01:43:28,080
cheesecloth um put it up to a very very

2050
01:43:25,439 --> 01:43:30,238
low boil like just a boil inside a

2051
01:43:28,079 --> 01:43:32,359
double boiler we'll heat that coconut

2052
01:43:30,238 --> 01:43:34,678
oil up we'll stick the cheesecloth in

2053
01:43:32,359 --> 01:43:37,118
there with the uh plant matter and we'll

2054
01:43:34,679 --> 01:43:39,679
steep we can soak that I mean in a crock

2055
01:43:37,118 --> 01:43:41,598
pot you can leave it up to 8 hours you

2056
01:43:39,679 --> 01:43:44,359
can get the job done in about 2 to 3

2057
01:43:41,599 --> 01:43:45,880
hours just on a stove top and uh that's

2058
01:43:44,359 --> 01:43:47,799
what we're going to do next on the video

2059
01:43:45,880 --> 01:43:49,880
so I hope you guys are loving this stuff

2060
01:43:47,800 --> 01:43:53,100
and there's more to come so thanks for

2061
