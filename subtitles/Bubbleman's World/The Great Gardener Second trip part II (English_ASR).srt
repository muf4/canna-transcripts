all

34
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:50,400
right so this room is uh all the canonic

35
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:54,280
uh CBD High hybrids uh we got Afghan

36
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,319
digweed Warlock and Renee in here and

37
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,640
some of them we have multiple phenotypes

38
00:03:56,318 --> 00:04:02,219
so let's have a look at them and uh you

39
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:05,318
can you can uh see which one you

40
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:09,560
[Music]

41
00:04:05,318 --> 00:04:13,000
like so here sits the

42
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:15,000
Afghan ah the Afghan now you're going to

43
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,600
short Christmas

44
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,918
tree Indica all the way right so we

45
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,960
wanted to create a high CBD version so

46
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:25,000
we crossed it with the canonic that you

47
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:29,399
saw

48
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:32,319
upstairs now I have two phenotypes here

49
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:35,120
of The Afghani cross with the canonic

50
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:38,159
this is the Afghan canonic number eight

51
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,079
this is The Afghani canonic number six

52
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:44,160
you can see this one's a little bit more

53
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:47,758
short Stout the bed structure is similar

54
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:51,000
to the bed structure of the Afghan

55
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,960
whereas this one shows this one shows

56
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,240
you know side branching out sort of the

57
00:04:52,959 --> 00:05:00,239
main stock uh and more of the canonic

58
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:01,720
traits that like we saw upstairs

59
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,918
when

60
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:10,440
choosing you know which one is going to

61
00:05:04,918 --> 00:05:14,639
be the Afghani catonic or CBD Afghan but

62
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:14,639
right now our bet is right

63
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,038
here interesting and that's just from uh

64
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,800
how it looks and how it grows and then

65
00:05:20,038 --> 00:05:23,800
and then the final one will be sort of

66
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:26,918
how it smokes we'll make sure that it

67
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:29,280
smokes similar to The Afghan and then as

68
00:05:26,918 --> 00:05:32,159
long as it does then sort of the CBD

69
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:34,638
afgh will be born now we know it already

70
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:38,759
does uh that's why it was chos and we're

71
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:41,800
down to two we started with 50 uh

72
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:44,038
so excellent oh they look great find

73
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,800
some gems I like them right side by side

74
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:49,519
too these ones are definitely a little

75
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:50,918
bit taller and have that more pronounced

76
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:55,680
Cola

77
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:58,959
yeah stretchy right they're stretching

78
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:01,079
yeah perfect right perfect example A lot

79
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:04,478
of these we hav't top but some of them

80
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:06,560
we have so like this one we never topped

81
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:10,279
this one we did but so you can see this

82
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,500
one has four large tops where this one

83
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:11,679
that

84
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,319
[Music]

85
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,120
doesn't I got uh in another room I'll

86
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,840
show you top versus uh non-top

87
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,680
experiment everything in this room has

88
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:23,959
been top uh no has most think some of

89
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,598
them haven't been top this whole table

90
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:29,239
hasn't really been

91
00:06:26,598 --> 00:06:32,279
toed look at the got a good experiment

92
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,280
the other to show

93
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:40,079
it I love the difference in the color of

94
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:42,680
the leaves there yeah the light green

95
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:45,079
and a little bit of the intensity off of

96
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:47,759
the adjusted Wings there'll be two

97
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:50,079
strips that go down and work it's just

98
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:54,120
it gets enough of the crossover light

99
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:57,318
that that set that strip requires a

100
00:06:54,120 --> 00:07:00,478
little bit more nutrient than say down

101
00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:03,120
the middle strip right um you know I've

102
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:04,560
tried everything to raising the lights

103
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,439
lowering the lights you can raise the

104
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,038
lights within the adjusted Wings you can

105
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:11,918
squeeze the adjusted Wings in and out we

106
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:14,560
always end up with those two strips but

107
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:16,439
oh well yeah it's interesting yeah it's

108
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,439
interesting stuff but here we get we

109
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:20,079
really get the advantage of the adjusted

110
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:22,399
Wings cuz the adjusted Wing hits the

111
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:25,439
adjacent table whereas normally you

112
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:27,638
would have a wall here you get the light

113
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:30,079
to come here and bounce to come back in

114
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:31,560
well here it bounces off of that that

115
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:33,719
and comes over here and this what

116
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:36,199
bounces it comes over here oh it's great

117
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:39,199
so this is a great experiment to sort of

118
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:42,919
show how many

119
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:45,680
uh tables you can do and and you sort of

120
00:07:42,918 --> 00:07:48,198
gain light by adding

121
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,680
tables and so we've got our afghanis

122
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:53,030
then we've got our Afghan

123
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:54,759
canonic and then we got

124
00:07:53,029 --> 00:07:59,918
[Music]

125
00:07:54,759 --> 00:08:02,479
our over here it say dig weed

126
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:06,359
ah the digweed and what is the digweed

127
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:09,120
the digweed is uh now it's a sweet too

128
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:11,158
cross it was a member of the Vancouver

129
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:14,280
out Capac Society they started up a

130
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:15,918
couple sweet uh Sweet Tooth seeds and he

131
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:20,239
ended up getting two really nice

132
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:21,878
phenotypes one ended up becoming the POI

133
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,598
which is a very popular strain at the

134
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:25,599
vix and then he ended up giving us the

135
00:08:23,598 --> 00:08:28,199
other one and we loved it just cuz its

136
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:31,719
flavor and its structure it's easy to

137
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:35,038
grow it's it's uh you know super thick

138
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:37,560
stocks it could really hold its weight

139
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:40,199
so we ended up taking that sweet tooth

140
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:42,199
and then Crossing it with the Afghan

141
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,919
that you guys saw over there to try to

142
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:47,360
give it a little bit more of that

143
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:49,240
Christmas tree structure and and

144
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,879
strength

145
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:54,879
uh and then it got its name because dig

146
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:57,519
weed the cat it's his favorite strain he

147
00:08:54,879 --> 00:09:00,439
loves it so he's a he's a famous cat

148
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:02,959
that's known to trim bu

149
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,839
and he has a good old time so this is

150
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:08,919
his strain digweed and then we cross

151
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:11,399
that with the canonic to get some uh CBD

152
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:13,719
in it now this is the only phenotype

153
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:18,000
that made it all the way through the

154
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:19,560
gauntlet uh to the end of uh you know

155
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,519
looking like

156
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:26,479
digweed uh you know finishing growing

157
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:32,039
everything that sort of digweed is and

158
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:32,039
has the CBD marker in it so this di

159
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:38,639
we just have a couple little extra acgh

160
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:41,070
canies thr some of this and if we come

161
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:44,919
down

162
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:49,839
[Music]

163
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:52,199
here we have the CBD warlock now this is

164
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:54,680
one phenotype this isn't the phenotype

165
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,920
this is actually the phenotype that I

166
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:58,559
don't

167
00:09:55,919 --> 00:10:01,278
particularly like uh it doesn't really

168
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:04,000
have the the Warlock it's just that sort

169
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:08,360
of diesel

170
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:12,759
gasoline uh petroleum sort of smell so

171
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:16,399
greasy and and uh it's such a such an

172
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:19,360
amazing flavor and taste and feel that

173
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:21,600
to have a CBD warlock it really has to

174
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,560
have all these traits to it so I have

175
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:28,000
another one it's not not here uh it's at

176
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:30,838
another room uh it's a little bit better

177
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,120
but it's

178
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:36,200
it still had you smell it it still has

179
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:40,200
it still has that uh it has the the

180
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:43,600
smell just not it's

181
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:46,440
there it's definitely there and then on

182
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,920
this table we have the Renee the end of

183
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:51,079
the Renee project the

184
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:53,719
Renee I'm definitely going to be stoked

185
00:10:51,078 --> 00:10:57,759
on Rene as always

186
00:10:53,720 --> 00:11:00,879
yeah so here we have the Renee number

187
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:03,480
two this is the a number seven this one

188
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:07,000
isn't uh this one doesn't have the cvd

189
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:10,320
marker for it but it's it it was such a

190
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,200
a beautiful plant that we had to keep it

191
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,839
and then it didn't have the CBD marker

192
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,920
yeah it doesn't have the CBD marker but

193
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:19,600
it's such a beautiful cross between the

194
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:22,078
two that we just had to keep the the

195
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,879
phenotype you can see you can see how

196
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:27,638
beastly it is

197
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:30,120
yeah and then this is the

198
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:32,039
rc11 rc1

199
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,919
and then you can see so if you zoom in

200
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:39,078
if you sort of zoom in on those tops

201
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:41,919
yeah you'll see that you know they're

202
00:11:39,078 --> 00:11:45,000
not very small and the

203
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:48,639
hairs don't really extend like I want

204
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,440
them to now if you come over to like

205
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:54,720
this one's the this one's the seven you

206
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:57,320
can see how it has that sort of

207
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,959
Snowball Effect to it and even and then

208
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:03,760
even the number two the number two

209
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:05,239
it's not it's not as good as the as or

210
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:08,919
as the number

211
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:11,759
seven but it's just it's the way they're

212
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:14,559
stacked and and the healthiness of the

213
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:16,480
of the plant compared to the 11 but

214
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:18,638
these are both renes they're both renees

215
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:22,199
and they're both High CBD so we just got

216
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:25,000
to figure out which one's better well

217
00:12:22,198 --> 00:12:28,259
Rene sure has an amazing tpine

218
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:31,330
profile yeah yeah

219
00:12:28,259 --> 00:12:31,330
[Music]

220
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,919
awesome so yeah this room will finish up

221
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:48,439
in the next 4 weeks and I guess we'll

222
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:51,240
shut down oh well or John Conroy will or

223
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:55,680
Kirk tuca the great lawyers in our

224
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:58,639
community will get the injunction and

225
00:12:55,679 --> 00:13:01,120
get us our personal grow rights back

226
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,120
because

227
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,079
because look at all the great work

228
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:06,639
you've been

229
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:08,838
doing gives us the

230
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:11,278
opportunity figure out what the members

231
00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:13,760
are you know they what they want so

232
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:16,600
we'll we'll actually take say those two

233
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:18,679
afghanis and and we'll give them to the

234
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:21,519
members of the

235
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:24,000
club and let them choose let them choose

236
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:26,720
which one's best sure cuz it's they

237
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,720
always they'll always let you know for

238
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,639
me man that one I got up I got I've had

239
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:34,199
ladies I've had ladies show up and they

240
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:37,120
be like I got out of bed for the first

241
00:13:34,198 --> 00:13:39,958
time in 2 weeks because of that specific

242
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,759
strain just like I'm here today because

243
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:43,439
I smoked out strain and allowed me to

244
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:44,879
get out of bed and now they want to tell

245
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,440
you that you can't grow it anymore I

246
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:49,278
likeed your analogy earlier of uh you

247
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,519
know you can't you can't make food at

248
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:54,838
home anymore yeah yeah it's illegal to

249
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:56,480
make food it's illegal to make food at

250
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:58,920
your home now you have to go buy it in a

251
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:02,839
restaurant that's the analogy to what

252
00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:05,278
the the mm mm cancellation is is you

253
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:07,079
can't buy food anymore or you can't make

254
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:09,759
food at home anymore you can't use your

255
00:14:07,078 --> 00:14:11,958
stove at home anymore because your stove

256
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:13,440
is a fire hazard it has the capabilities

257
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:15,679
of burning your house down it's going to

258
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,079
burn the community down so you can't do

259
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:19,679
that you have to go out and you have to

260
00:14:17,078 --> 00:14:22,799
take your family to a restaurant every

261
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:25,039
single night and eat every single day

262
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:27,639
every be a little more expensive but uh

263
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:29,759
you know what it'll be safer it's safer

264
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:32,680
for the community right right that's a

265
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:34,440
great that's a great that's a great uh

266
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:37,758
plan I don't know I got to I got to say

267
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:40,360
I feel pretty safe right

268
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:43,959
here like in this

269
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:46,120
Garden I feel safe

270
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:48,599
warm yeah

271
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:50,720
wonderful it can't go away the house of

272
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,920
the greatek gardener can't go away and

273
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,519
nor can any of the other Canadian

274
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:56,519
Growers who have licenses and are

275
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:59,799
licensed to either grow for themselves

276
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:01,480
or friends family loved ones

277
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:03,399
we need to have these rights we need to

278
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:07,159
be able to access this

279
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:10,278
medicine and most importantly we need to

280
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:13,120
have it be an open gene pool you know

281
00:15:10,278 --> 00:15:15,919
you can't Corral it into such a small

282
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:18,440
amount of companies because you'll

283
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:20,399
inevitably turn the Jean Pool into a

284
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:22,519
into a bit of a trailer park well you

285
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:26,120
just regulate the clubs right the clubs

286
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:28,639
that are existing already service tens

287
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:31,078
of thousands of people why why are you

288
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:33,278
not just regulating the clubs like it's

289
00:15:31,078 --> 00:15:35,958
just you're just a ridiculous

290
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:38,278
program uh you know the only people that

291
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:40,599
can access it are people that have

292
00:15:38,278 --> 00:15:43,519
millions and tens of millions of dollars

293
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:46,399
that can build these super sophisticated

294
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:48,000
systems to grow a plant that's already

295
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:51,198
been helping people

296
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,440
for Millennia million

297
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:55,879
years like if you need a really you need

298
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,839
to really grow it in a in a sterile

299
00:15:55,879 --> 00:15:59,439
environment like it's these aren't

300
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:02,160
pharmaceutical things these are like

301
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:04,240
tomatoes do you grow your tomatoes in a

302
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:05,879
super sterile lab and then irradiate

303
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,198
them and then iriate them and then send

304
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:09,799
them back grind them into pulp right you

305
00:16:08,198 --> 00:16:12,198
want to make your own

306
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:14,039
alcohol make that we can make that at

307
00:16:12,198 --> 00:16:17,479
home you can make beer at home you can

308
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:19,599
make you know why why can't why can't

309
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:22,278
people just grow their own medicine why

310
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:25,399
we why why you allow people to grow

311
00:16:22,278 --> 00:16:28,198
medicine for 12 years and then all of a

312
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:29,720
sudden say nah you can't do that anymore

313
00:16:28,198 --> 00:16:31,559
well the bottom line is it's not going

314
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:33,440
to happen we're going to fight it no

315
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:36,039
one's going to allow this to happen the

316
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,800
government has to sort of give their

317
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:39,639
head a shake and realize that it's fine

318
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:42,278
to bring in licensed producers but not

319
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:44,399
at the expense of personal

320
00:16:42,278 --> 00:16:46,120
production definitely not at the expense

321
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,519
of personal

322
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:51,318

Civ and just you'll find things like

531

hyoma and so you've got MP for the

536
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:22,919
microplane yeah MP for microplane the

537
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:24,918
size the date should be on actually this

538
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:27,159
one this will be

539
00:29:24,919 --> 00:29:29,759
microplaned but most of the new ones all

540
00:29:27,159 --> 00:29:34,480
Mark either

541
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:36,599
or uh how dark that one is I have gy 25

542
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:39,480
oh yeah that's the other one that's dark

543
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:42,199
like that the JT these are the early

544
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:45,240
early early

545
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:47,919
Civ uh techniques where there was a lot

546
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:51,759
of water still trapped in there they

547
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:54,480
went really dark mhm compared to

548
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:58,038
uh just let me go grab the sweet skunk

549
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,038
ones sure

550
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:09,440
nice big bags to sift in

551
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:12,519
the oh here comes some sweet skunk

552
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,519
coming through coming

553
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:19,079
through got

554
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:22,398
it sweet skunk gets her own

555
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:26,158
section as it should be sweet skunk so

556
00:30:22,398 --> 00:30:28,759
with this one because we waited a little

557
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:34,278
longer for our

558
00:30:28,759 --> 00:30:37,558
patties to dry before we sifted

559
00:30:34,278 --> 00:30:40,319
them I just want to find the same size

560
00:30:37,558 --> 00:30:44,678
sift 45 what are you looking for 90

561
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:47,879
plain 45 that would be the big one

562
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:50,759
so whereas the other one the Civ was

563
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:53,440
darker we've we've got it to a point

564
00:30:50,759 --> 00:30:56,440
where it's a little bit lighter but

565
00:30:53,440 --> 00:31:00,038
still the micr

566
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:02,798
plane is a little little bit

567
00:31:00,038 --> 00:31:05,638
lighter mhm but not a not such a

568
00:31:02,798 --> 00:31:05,638
dramatic

569
00:31:17,638 --> 00:31:22,638
difference that one looks nicer they

570
00:31:20,638 --> 00:31:25,398
both look

571
00:31:22,638 --> 00:31:27,678
great I appreciate both their textures

572
00:31:25,398 --> 00:31:29,558
and their colors and they I just know

573
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:31,880
this when I look at a hash up close like

574
00:31:29,558 --> 00:31:34,480
this and I want to smoke it then

575
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:39,159
everything's

576
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:39,159
right so let's smoke some shall we all

577
00:31:39,798 --> 00:31:45,480
right you can't be right next to a

578
00:31:42,638 --> 00:31:48,719
freezer full of hash this nice and not

579
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:50,440
just smoke a bunch of it so we're going

580
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:53,120
to get back to a bunch of puffing and

581
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:55,278
we'll catch you in a little

582
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:59,199
bit

583
00:31:55,278 --> 00:32:02,119
73 73 73

584
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:05,038
sweet scope coming right very good very

585
00:32:02,119 --> 00:32:09,638
good and is that the 73 with the 90 bag

586
00:32:05,038 --> 00:32:11,319
or the AKA real 73 pre 90 bag I don't

587
00:32:09,638 --> 00:32:13,959
know what you're talking about well

588
00:32:11,319 --> 00:32:16,960
before I added the 90 Micron bag all the

589
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:19,360
90 Micron hash used to go into the 73

590
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:21,360
bag so for those of us that used to make

591
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:23,000
it back in the day that don't that that

592
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:26,319
now the 90 came along and it really

593
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:30,440
robbed the 73 of a lot of what made it

594
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:34,759
special and so basically we call the 73

595
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:37,519
that's pre 90 Micron bag we call it the

596
00:32:34,759 --> 00:32:40,240
real 73 cuz it's got all that 90 in it

597
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:41,558
too take a hit of the 90 and the 73 and

598
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:45,319
that's the real

599
00:32:41,558 --> 00:32:47,918
73 all right all right 73 we're doing it

600
00:32:45,319 --> 00:32:52,038
so it looks like we pulled sweet skunk

601
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:54,880
73 microplane out of the freezer this is

602
00:32:52,038 --> 00:32:54,879
a very light

603
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:00,399
color and I just put it next to the dry

604
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:02,799
sifts here to show you kind of the

605
00:33:00,398 --> 00:33:04,599
different colors this is you know two

606
00:33:02,798 --> 00:33:07,638
dry sifts this is H

607
00:33:04,599 --> 00:33:10,798
99 this is Homa 99 and this one is and

608
00:33:07,638 --> 00:33:12,798
this this one's a afgh heom mix right

609
00:33:10,798 --> 00:33:15,240
definitely have more of a yellowish look

610
00:33:12,798 --> 00:33:17,119
to them but then again this one these

611
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:20,798
never were exposed to water and they

612
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:22,959
were never um Frozen for for that matter

613
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:25,319
either so this was both this was made

614
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:27,399
with water and also Frozen basically

615
00:33:25,319 --> 00:33:31,359
kept in the freezer after probably out

616
00:33:27,398 --> 00:33:34,678
