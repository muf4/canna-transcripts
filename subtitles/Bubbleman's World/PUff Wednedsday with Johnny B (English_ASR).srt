49
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,800
a nice little dunk on this a dunk d a

50
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,759
little dunk and doodle so what it was is

51
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,000
is I found this bag of Congo in my

52
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:28,560
closet hold on that and it definitely

53
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,280
had your name on it just because I think

54
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,318
last AUM on your birthday

55
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,159
yeah we smoke Congo makes sense it

56
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:36,318
wouldn't it make sense y totally makes

57
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:38,959
sense I'm just saying so this is a nice

58
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:40,839
clean it was only a one static pass

59
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:44,360
because I didn't have time to make it

60
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:45,640
like your brand of bubble yeah yeah sft

61
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,360
you know what I mean oh I think it'll be

62
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:48,719
wonderful but I know it melts and I know

63
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,959
you're going to love the

64
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:52,359
taste so I guess the one thing with

65
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,039
these Club bangers is you really just

66
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,840
have to gauge the time that you hit them

67
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:58,280
for I'm not sure it's especially this

68
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,519
early on in its life cycle I I doubt

69
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,719
that it will turn any different color

70
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:06,080
it's white exactly well they you can get

71
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:08,719
them orange eventually I know but uh and

72
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,440
I've always been told to hit these like

73
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:13,000
you know kind of evenly don't just hold

74
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:15,000
the torch in one

75
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,400
spot I'm sure someone out there is

76
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,919
laughing at how I'm heating this up

77
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,840
right now dude he's totally [ __ ] it

78
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:23,119
up he's totally doing it WR actually

79
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,719
bubble man doesn't know how to use a

80
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,200
[ __ ] torch if you had two you could

81
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:27,519
heat it up quicker well you're kind of

82
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:29,039
right I kind of don't know how to use a

83
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,879
torch you actually don't know how to use

84
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:32,840
a torch not a big torch guy you know I'm

85
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:34,158
not going to lie not a torch guy my

86
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,280

88
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:41,759
feeling I use my hand usually to uh it's

89
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,598
windy oh to gauge the uh the heat we got

90
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:46,919
helicopters all around I'd rather hit it

91
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:49,759
a little cooler than a little hotter we

92
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:52,318
like the flavor I'm not going to lie I a

93
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:53,959
cooler nail gives you a better flavor

94
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:54,958
well this wind is cooling it down Wicked

95
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:57,000
I'll tell you that much I think I'm

96

104
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:17,840

109
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:27,319

in Jamaica with Bobo Bobo he asked me

121
00:04:52,038 --> 00:04:55,719
for a bud and I didn't have one and then

122
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:57,840
I talked about the Jamaica the Toronto

123
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,520
thing and how bad I felt because I had

124
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,918
just given your butt away to Marcel and

125
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:03,399
and then when Bobo came up and asked for

126
00:05:00,918 --> 00:05:06,079
the bud I just wasn't able I just was

127
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:08,439
like dude I I can't it's not my bud I

128
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:10,959
already tried the giving it away and it

129
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:12,719
it it didn't really work out very well

130
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:14,038
and uh so we had another funny

131
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,080
experience in Jamaica I'll have to tell

132

143
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,800
chef like nowhere like yeah we're in the

144
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:47,160

145
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:49,439
Buon fck and this guy starts cooking

147
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:52,839
dude so we're going to Puff a couple of

148
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:54,318
bowls in a couple of different parts of

149
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:56,359
the park just to show you the beauty and

150
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:58,199
have a little conversation but I also

151
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,520
brought the Drone out today so I thought

152
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:02,639
we would show you a little bit about

153
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:04,719
about like the aerial uh view of where

154
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,759
we are right now so I'm going to do an

155
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,160
aerial view of each spot but probably

156
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:10,240
towards the end cuz I'm not sure I

157
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,479
should be puffing and droning

158
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:17,000
simultaneously how was that

159
00:06:13,478 --> 00:06:19,159
hit off the ceramic Bowl The

160
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,639
Banger did you hit it at the right time

161
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:25,039
did you hit it a little early a little

162
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:26,560
late I hit that thing perfectly nice

163
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:28,800
that's that's the way to do it I got

164
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,399
some experience in this stuff yeah I'll

165
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,400
put it off for you

166
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:36,318
I'll give it a cook ski for you I've

167
00:06:34,038 --> 00:06:38,800
actually been trained in puffing full

168
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:41,280
melt trained in puffing dry sift and

169
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:44,360
bubble has by you oh my gosh over the

170
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:46,239
last few years man I mean we were I was

171
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,520
talking with my friend today about years

172
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,960
ago we said we were just scratching the

173
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:52,240
surface now we got tpes and we got sifts

174
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:53,719
and this and rosins and it's just like

175
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,960
and the and then the bubbles and all the

176
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:59,039
different changes it's like it's

177
00:06:55,959 --> 00:07:01,159
ridiculous no matter how much we have

178
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:02,918
what at gets pulled out first the sift

179
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,919
the full male dyon always the sift the

180
00:07:02,918 --> 00:07:08,000
full male dyon who in their right

181
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:09,878
[ __ ] mind would would say anything

182
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,680
other than that I think someone that

183
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:14,599
maybe doesn't have all of the choices

184
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,319
but then again we are all different

185
00:07:14,598 --> 00:07:18,279
maybe there's someone out there it's

186
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,240
completely [ __ ] insane I prefer it's

187
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:21,719
just smoke weed yeah there you go just

188
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,400
just bud you never know we support you

189
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,879
if you're out there we're all insane and

190
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:27,159
our own rights and uh I think it's time

191
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:29,599
for a little Drone footage what do you

192
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:32,360
think oh God I was stoked that you had

193
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:34,759
your phone hooked up I was like what the

194
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,240

195
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:37,680

196
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,598

198
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:44,120
like kidding me oh yeah dude this thing

199
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,560
okay so don't put your hand here this

200
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,079
thing is hella fun so I'm going to uh

201
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:50,120
leave that camera on so we still have

202
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:52,680
the audio and uh sorry I had to do that

203
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:56,158
we're going to send this bad boy

204
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:58,439
off okay this is pretty cool I've I just

205
00:07:56,158 --> 00:08:00,879
have to say like we've seen them I know

206
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:03,918
people have had them this one

207
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:05,759
small it's pretty tiny it's it's very

208
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:07,279
tiny it's definitely like a small can

209
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,720
can can it like quarter on a pound and

210
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:09,959
drop it off at local dispensaries you

211
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,159
know definitely one of the things they

212
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:15,598
say about these is to not apply anything

213
00:08:13,158 --> 00:08:18,879
to them do not put uh any weight to them

214
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:20,519
any weight on them so let's see what we

215
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,879
got here okay I like how the camera

216
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:24,680
moves back and forth that's pretty cool

217
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,039
yeah I'm still trying to like learn it a

218
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,240
little bit okay so in other words don't

219
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:32,199
sit right here when he turns it

220
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:34,918
on my face and and and and hits the

221
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:38,560
titanium in my

222
00:08:34,918 --> 00:08:42,360
neck no titanium in Johnny we moving out

223
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:47,119
of the way all right so let's close this

224
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:47,120
off oh normal they just

225
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:53,278
firmware loing satellite M May cost a

226
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:55,919
lot of no problem apparently it's going

227
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:58,360
to kill your battery no uh data usage

228
00:08:55,919 --> 00:09:00,199
cuz dat I'm usually hooked up to the uh

229
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,399
to the internet

230
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:04,278

231
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:07,159
internet connection in Stanley

232
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:07,679

262
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:19,719

295
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:26,439
project or whatever they work for the

296
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:27,958
movies and TV I just like like well I

297
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:31,320

298
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:34,759
kidding me she just shames my drone oh

299
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:37,278
your little mini drone is cute boy yeah

300
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:38,559
we got one with 100 Grand it does

301
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:40,679
high-end

302
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:43,638
digital that's well that's the whole

303
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:45,599
thing about technology right I

304
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:47,519
mean you got it that's the whole thing

305
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:51,079
about technology it doesn't want to Pi

306
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:53,879
up cuz it's cold it's cold but I could

307
00:13:51,078 --> 00:13:56,120
be heating this up I'll heat it up get

308
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:57,759
it on it so this is actually the camera

309
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:00,078
cover which I thought was pretty

310
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:02,320
cool flying

311
00:14:00,078 --> 00:14:06,278
everywhere yeah it's important for the

312
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:08,600
gimbal to be um you know held in place

313
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:12,159
when in storage this has to be done so

314
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:13,839
it can deliver a gram of hash it very

315
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:16,198
well made but one of the things they say

316
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,040
right off the bat is to not put stickers

317
00:14:16,198 --> 00:14:20,319
to not offset the balance of it because

318
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:21,639
it is a fairly precise instrument I'm

319
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,199
going to say we have to put a gr on each

320
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:26,440
Corner though well it's it would

321
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:28,439
definitely somehow be able to work we

322
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:30,639
got to do a gram delivery it has to

323
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:32,720
happen today like right you'd have to

324
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:35,159
put it right on the top and scrape it

325
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:38,040
off just rosin just press it on and then

326
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:40,958
we'll watch the Drone fly into the ocean

327
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:42,399
in the most hilarious of ways and and

328
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:44,439
the thing is is is the footage will be

329
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,600
on the phone yeah so that's the best

330
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:48,120
part we didn't lose footage no the

331
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,600
footage is on the chip on the on there

332
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:52,720
you can only watch it through that wire

333
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:55,560
that I have set up so somehow we have to

334
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,680
record it while watching the Drone it

335
00:14:55,559 --> 00:15:00,359
won't go into the

336
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:02,479
ocean but definitely a um a new

337
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:04,600
perspective on taking a better look at a

338
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,560
lot of things I mean I'm curious on the

339
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,920
laws around drones can we fly them

340
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:10,239
downtown Vancouver um can we fly them

341
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:11,599
outs side of the apartment building

342
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,079
there are no fly zones and you can go

343
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,440
online and find out where they are fly

344
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:17,958
zones airports are big no fly zones I'm

345
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:20,720
pretty much okay so I can't fly these

346
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:21,838
near my place not near your airport but

347
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,320
you can definitely fly it around your

348
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:26,880
property yeah you go to the Fraser R

349
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,399
River and get unbelievable footage all

350
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:29,679
up and down the river oh dude I was at

351
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,318
the you could wait for someone to catch

352
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:33,599
a sturgeon and

353
00:15:31,318 --> 00:15:35,559
go I was on top of veter mountain

354
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,959
yesterday that's where I went I went for

355
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:38,679
a little little trip and you know what

356
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:40,638
bringing that thing up there and seeing

357
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:43,919
the world is is all high and overlooking

358
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:47,079
all of the valley would be so amazing if

359
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:50,039
we go on the Argo I can set I can set it

360
00:15:47,078 --> 00:15:52,399
to so we don't have to do this part we

361
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:54,159
just push a button and it follows us

362
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,360
well no there's no he said if I was like

363
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:58,879
yeah that's

364
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:00,120
happening there's no ifs or ANS but I'm

365
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:01,679
going to have to wait probably another

366
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:04,240
I'm going to wait till the surgeon on

367
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:08,399
May 17th gives me the okay that's a good

368
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,399
idea I knew my lid was blown

369
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:13,719
away like see that's a fly zone right

370
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,600
there so I probably couldn't fly the

371
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,720
drone over the water

372
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,278
there

373
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:21,639
sir so I'm still learning we can go on

374
00:16:20,278 --> 00:16:24,278
the website too and check it out and

375
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:26,759
make sure we're not uh breaking on any

376
00:16:24,278 --> 00:16:29,039
unnecessary laws the best part about a

377
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:32,199
friend having a drone friend having a

378
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:33,719
drone a friend having a drone uh I think

379
00:16:32,198 --> 00:16:35,958
there's a responsibility too to make

380
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:37,759
sure that you're not creeping people out

381
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:39,439
flying near people's homes and looking

382
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,919
in their windows and that sort of thing

383
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,519
so I'm avoiding that at all costs just

384
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:46,000
trying to have fun with my drone and get

385
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:48,399
some footage and uh definitely don't

386
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,078
want to be uh stepping on anyone's toes

387
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:52,639
unnecessarily so that's Johnny B's

388
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:54,278
second dab we're going to head over to

389
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:57,159
the totem poles get some more Drone

390
00:16:54,278 --> 00:16:59,360
footage and we'll uh see you

391
00:16:57,159 --> 00:17:01,198
soon all right so we found ourselves

392
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,279
another Zone here nice little bench in

393
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:06,519
front of a big vast open field uh we're

394
00:17:04,279 --> 00:17:08,199
kind of on a peninsula in the back of it

395
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:09,879
and there's north and west Vancouver

396
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:11,880
over there and then you have Vancouver

397
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:14,520
the convention center in downtown over

398
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:16,240
here and we thought we would a puff some

399
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:17,160
more bowls out of Johnny's little head

400
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,078
piece

401
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:24,679
here got a little West Coast concentrate

402
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:28,078
120 Micron Green Crack God oh really

403
00:17:24,679 --> 00:17:30,480
[ __ ] it smells so good really super nice

404
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:32,079
so so we're going to do that and uh I

405
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,038
guess I'll fire this drone up and get a

406
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:37,960
little bit of the footage so I can enjoy

407
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:41,400
my bowl maybe I'll we got planes we got

408
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:45,079
helicopters we got Army um we got a

409
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:47,480
whole a whole wide variety of yeah we do

410
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:49,759
things in the air yeah we do we're about

411
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:51,360
to put one more up there so so you know

412
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:53,640
what I I just kind of maybe we can get

413
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:56,038
some some views of some other uh

414
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:57,400
airplanes probably not yeah let's see

415
00:17:56,038 --> 00:18:00,079
what we can do

416
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:01,960
here this car have what I've been using

417
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:05,439
was as a kind of

418
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:07,880
like my drop down all right all right

419
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:10,840
only one I

420
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:13,200
have that was my aircraft engaging

421
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:15,119
aircraft engaging when you hear that

422
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:18,159
sound you know there an aircraft being

423
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:20,439
engaged all right let's do this let's uh

424
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:23,760
let's take off e

425
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:26,400
hey just dab that out e oh it's

426
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:28,679
initializing I moved it it's on a little

427
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,519
bit of an angle so it's got to be yeah

428
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:34,159
the IMU reinitializes and so it'll just

429
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:35,359
take a few seconds before it does that

430
00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:37,320
in the meantime we're going to keep this

431
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:38,879
torch yeah there you go heat that up

432
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:41,678
going to get this

433
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:44,760
ready heat that

434
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:47,519
up I AMU is initializing do not move the

435
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:50,720
aircraft until initialization is

436
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:52,319
complete all right is going to be

437
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,000
hard

438
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:57,079
what pull it out gently a little bit you

439
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,319
know loosen a bit and then flip the jar

440
00:18:57,079 --> 00:19:00,960
upside down in your hand and then press

441
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:04,798
it between your fingers it's very high

442
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:07,279
quality so it would be quite easy to do

443
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:07,279
that's what I
