doing if it's legit or not I don't know

127
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,040
if they still have anything that they

128
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,790

00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:43,069
I told you that I would bring my kazoo

165
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:46,580
but I couldn't find it the only thing I

166
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:50,560
found was a rusty old Jews heart that I

167
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:53,600
bought in Afghanistan about 45 years ago

168
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:56,819
well maybe you could play the spoons

169
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:59,470
[Laughter]

170
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:01,600
Wow I played you know how I played

171
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:04,420
spoons i hammered them out with a hammer

172
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,850
and I used them as hot knives because

173
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:11,458
they just have a wider surface area this

174
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:11,459
was back in the late 80s but true story

175
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:18,310
story so Marcus is a really interesting

176
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:20,519
topic that you and Sam are talking on we

177
00:09:18,309 --> 00:09:23,049
had I had mentioned hey these guys are

178
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:25,750
seen their presents come back online all

179
00:09:23,049 --> 00:09:28,838
of a sudden and I had asked you directly

180
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:30,759
hey what do you know about this and it

181
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:32,470
sounds extremely interesting especially

182
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:34,778
since there's such a Renaissance of this

183
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:37,959
super sativa Club because it brings such

184
00:09:34,778 --> 00:09:41,289
a mythology to to everything that I

185
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:43,588
think entices everyone so it's really

186
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:47,319
interesting to hear Stan's perspectives

187
00:09:43,589 --> 00:09:52,290
to be honest their real specialty I mean

188
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:52,290
they did produce seeds because I think

189
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:59,440
what was really special about these guys

190
00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:02,198
back in the day when they started is

191
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,899
they were experts at light and

192
00:10:02,198 --> 00:10:07,419
everything else indoor growing they knew

193
00:10:04,899 --> 00:10:09,240
how to water our houses so that they did

194
00:10:07,419 --> 00:10:11,289
not burn down

195
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,209
yeah that's pretty important especially

196
00:10:11,289 --> 00:10:15,939
back in the day when they were kind of

197
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:19,599
looking for anything to paint a dirty

198
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:22,180
picture about us you know any any

199
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,009
possible dirty picture they could could

200
00:10:22,179 --> 00:10:25,809
could write about us or where did the

201
00:10:24,009 --> 00:10:31,990
sativa go man I mean I remember going

202
00:10:25,809 --> 00:10:34,419
into the Tatsu and it was like ah you

203
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:36,100
know it smelled potal haze it was it's

204
00:10:34,419 --> 00:10:37,870
like now it seems like the only haze

205
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:40,240
the only fake haze you can get knowledge

206
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:43,240
is Blue Dream I know it's Blue Dream has

207
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,620
hazing it but where's the real like I

208
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,089
made you get that [ __ ] up in Canada I

209
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:50,019
was up in Canada the day I got some of

210
00:10:46,089 --> 00:10:51,370
rock and hash is like you know you guys

211
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:53,350
may be on the East Coast you could find

212
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:55,328
that but the same thing with sativa

213
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:57,250
it's like where did this Siva go that

214
00:10:55,328 --> 00:10:59,739
was the illest illest illest that

215
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:01,720
nevile's haze and the super silver just

216
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:03,909
like and then if someone cries it out or

217
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,949
some lemon hey you know it's not really

218
00:11:03,909 --> 00:11:06,730
it don't it's not that same that same

219
00:11:05,948 --> 00:11:12,448
light

220
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:12,449
that that that that distinct like really

221
00:11:12,809 --> 00:11:24,069
the basic problem is that haze to take

222
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:26,350
up to 24 weeks our price up in the West

223
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:28,120
Coast is going it's going hella down you

224
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:29,800
think some mug will get his boutique on

225
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,659
and just go for it and just have and

226
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:35,129
then sell it ship for two to two G's a

227
00:11:31,659 --> 00:11:35,129
pound sell or whatever you know I'm

228
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:41,409
surprised to know you know what it's so

229
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:44,050
true though it's the how much can I get

230
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:47,708
and how fast can I get it mentality that

231
00:11:44,049 --> 00:11:50,019
really know that drove that haze just

232
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:52,208
right out of the marketplace I I've got

233
00:11:50,019 --> 00:11:54,879
some extremely turpino lien rich I've

234
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:57,278
got some where's my bike going on here

235
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:59,049
right now that's got the amnesia Hazen

236
00:11:57,278 --> 00:12:00,669
and it's got what that kind of funk that

237
00:11:59,049 --> 00:12:03,789
you're talking about that terpene alene

238
00:12:00,669 --> 00:12:05,708
rich sort of exotic flavor profile it

239
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:07,569
only takes like 10 to 12 weeks so it's

240
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:09,129
not quite that you know the last time I

241
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:11,589
was in Barcelona with soma he had

242
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:15,458
something that was 26 weeks of flowering

243
00:12:11,589 --> 00:12:19,420
Wow I have some some golden road here

244
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:21,250
from Bodhi that are grower that's our

245
00:12:19,419 --> 00:12:24,610
leat one of our leads and Massachusetts

246
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:28,299
grew and it's fantastic it really it's

247
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:31,269
really delicious but it's you know it

248
00:12:28,299 --> 00:12:35,139
definitely brings you back to this super

249
00:12:31,269 --> 00:12:37,560
that super sativa Club vibe where it's

250
00:12:35,139 --> 00:12:40,870
you know it really brings you back

251
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:42,909
listen one of my first like the true

252
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:45,399
cultivars I fell in love with was haze

253
00:12:42,909 --> 00:12:47,860
obviously my son's middle name is haze I

254
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:51,190
have an affinity for it but in Manitoba

255
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:53,829
my old mentor Ron Hickey used to have

256
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:56,800
this he they had the original haze and

257
00:12:53,828 --> 00:12:59,559
it was so dank and so like almost cat

258
00:12:56,799 --> 00:13:02,019
pissy and terpene lee and rich and

259
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:06,969
frankincense II and yeah it was it took

260
00:13:02,019 --> 00:13:08,409
like 16 to 18 weeks to flower and a lot

261
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:09,430
of people just really you know when

262
00:13:08,409 --> 00:13:12,129
you're breaking the law and you're

263
00:13:09,429 --> 00:13:14,289
facing jail it's this how much can I get

264
00:13:12,129 --> 00:13:15,730
and how fast can I get mentality that

265
00:13:14,289 --> 00:13:17,679
you know people thought we were not

266
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:19,149
screwing something that took 16 to 18

267
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:22,239
weeks to flower yet

268
00:13:19,149 --> 00:13:24,610
when it was burning you could you could

269
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,620
hone in on someone in a busy club with

270
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:28,629
that haze you'd literally like I just

271
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:32,049
had people attach themselves to me like

272
00:13:28,629 --> 00:13:34,990
is that the haze you're smoking yeah it

273
00:13:32,049 --> 00:13:37,539
was distinctive as cush in terms of the

274
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:39,340
smell just different no doubt on the

275
00:13:37,539 --> 00:13:41,110
East Coast we had the Washington Heights

276
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:45,009
haze which was commonly on the street

277
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:47,800
called as the piff and that you know

278
00:13:45,009 --> 00:13:49,990
that that was historically the one you

279
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:51,159
know if you were grabbing the piss you

280
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:54,940
were the one in the room everybody

281
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:56,589
wanted to be close to ya I mean remember

282
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:58,240
the katsu though there's a whole coffee

283
00:13:56,590 --> 00:14:02,200
shop in I don't know if the cops are

284
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:04,149

285
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:06,700

286
00:14:04,149 --> 00:14:08,860
Holland for both raw deep old-school

287
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:10,900
Hayes's dude trust me we went right past

288
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:13,570
the counter we went right to the

289
00:14:10,899 --> 00:14:15,699
backroom we linked up with the owner and

290
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:17,980
he pulled she pulled his personal stash

291
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:20,080
out of his pocket and was hitting us

292
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:23,139
with bong rips of some quite lovely

293
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:25,990
resin but was it for sale at the katsu

294
00:14:23,139 --> 00:14:27,429
no it was not do they still have a Hayes

295
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:29,980
menu at the katsu

296
00:14:27,429 --> 00:14:31,809
they had some Hayes menus we weren't

297
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:34,120
interested in flour we went right for

298
00:14:31,809 --> 00:14:36,129
concentrates and hey Sam do you remember

299
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:40,929
what the owner of the katsu pulled out

300
00:14:36,129 --> 00:14:43,000
of his pipe that we smoked in March was

301
00:14:40,929 --> 00:14:46,209
that a haze was that something exotic I

302
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,490
can barely remember it was yeah you were

303
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:50,950
with me we would yeah yeah no that was

304
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:55,389
haze he pulled it out because it was

305
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:58,330
special I was yeah he certainly did he

306
00:14:55,389 --> 00:15:01,659
was he was he was actually an awe of Sam

307
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:03,100
he was like.he it's funny that how long

308

is the cat's who've been there first of

309
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:14,529
all really maybe 30 years or least 25 so

310
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:16,990

311
00:15:14,529 --> 00:15:18,879
zoo and meet the owner I have been there

312

a couple of times but I don't go to

313
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:25,689
coffee shops yeah no I know I'm kind of

314
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:27,580
in the same boat but at the same time

315
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:29,740
what a funny experience bubbleman and

316
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:32,050

does he have anything special in his

319
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:44,950
pocket we asked somebody who was working

320
00:15:41,589 --> 00:15:47,019
there correct I said what to get the

321
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:50,140
owner he says he doesn't want to be

322
00:15:47,019 --> 00:15:51,220
bothered I said well what you just asked

323

324
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:56,649

00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:59,980
cocaine made me deserve to go to jail

342
00:16:57,419 --> 00:17:04,389
drugs should be legalized stop fronting

343
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:06,970
yeah I agree with you but using cocaine

344
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:09,100
that's a serious sign of stupidity

345
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:12,400
don't be drug prejudice I ain't used

346
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:14,139
cocaine for 25 years but what do you

347
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,300

350
00:17:18,939 --> 00:17:24,240

351
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:30,069
like whatever I'm so over it

352
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:31,808
cokehead friends over to your house we

353
00:17:30,069 --> 00:17:33,250
have the options you know so I got the

354
00:17:31,808 --> 00:17:34,928
option you got the option do whatever

355
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:37,579
you want I got the option not to hang

356
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:39,259
out with you too

357
00:17:37,579 --> 00:17:45,949
you have why do you have crackhead

358
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:48,109
cokehead friends exactly blackhead

359
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:49,789
cokehead friends and neither is my

360
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:54,199
brother that you're speaking about that

361
00:17:49,789 --> 00:17:57,200
desert whatever the situation is it was

362
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:58,370
and to be like oh you deserve to be in

363
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,350
jail without known the full situation

364
00:17:58,369 --> 00:18:02,389
it's kind of presumptuous you know I

365
00:18:00,349 --> 00:18:11,449
mean but still my question is why did

366
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:14,540
that prank your cocaine friends I know

367
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:22,610
somebody's using coke even occasionally

368
00:18:14,539 --> 00:18:25,039
recreationally all right you know I I'm

369
00:18:22,609 --> 00:18:27,019
more of the of the feeling like I saw

370
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:29,869
the whole bougie thing play out I saw

371
00:18:27,019 --> 00:18:32,269
the footage and stuff yet I still felt

372
00:18:29,869 --> 00:18:34,549
deep down and I don't know Buju at all

373
00:18:32,269 --> 00:18:36,109
I've never met him I have friends that

374
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:38,089
are friends with him but I've

375
00:18:36,109 --> 00:18:40,699
appreciated his music a lot over the

376
00:18:38,089 --> 00:18:42,829
years and I just felt like there I don't

377
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:45,380
know why maybe it's a conspiracy person

378
00:18:42,829 --> 00:18:47,480
in me but I just always feel like you

379
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:50,240
know society wants to take down the

380
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:52,940
black man who gains power and who gains

381
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,859
a voice for himself and I just felt like

382
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:56,960
there was some like shenanigans going on

383
00:18:54,859 --> 00:18:59,479
like maybe Buju was entrapped maybe

384
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:02,480
there was some sketchiness going on I'm

385
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:04,700
glad that he's out personally and I will

386
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,829
absolutely be at the first concert that

387
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:09,700
I can be at that he's that he's playing

388
00:19:06,829 --> 00:19:12,259
at I hope it's in Jamaica personally

389
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:15,259
it's gonna be a beautiful beautiful

390
00:19:12,259 --> 00:19:19,430
thing when he hits the stage again so

391
00:19:15,259 --> 00:19:23,779

392
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:26,690

395
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,850
we do is we get together almost every

396
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,710
Sunday it was kind of a

397
00:19:31,849 --> 00:19:37,009
spur-of-the-moment thing when I was able

398
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:38,450
to YouTube stream live and I've got a

399
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:40,759
lot of sort of friends in the industry

400
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:42,350
and I started inviting them in and we

401
00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:44,059
just started having dialog through

402
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:45,889
dialogue you know like just like what

403
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:48,470
just happened maybe a little bit of

404
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:50,030
opinions that clash maybe some some

405
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:51,120
information and some knowledge we like

406
00:19:50,029 --> 00:19:53,190
to go deep down the

407
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:56,129

416

Morgan heritage rather well we just

432
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:08,699
released the the Africa Jamaica single

433
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:12,480
featuring diamond platnumz from Tanzania

434
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:14,940
is you know a multi-award winner MTV

435
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:18,150
Europe Awards and all these things and

436
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:20,490
I'm you know like the probably biggest

437
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:24,380
effort artists coming out of East Africa

438
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:26,940
and also featuring stone boy from Ghana

439
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:33,090
arguably the biggest artist coming out

440
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:36,740
of Ghana right now and it was what I

441
00:21:33,089 --> 00:21:42,659
funny but you know we work with we were

442
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:46,769
successful not we gained success in the

443
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:49,200
early 2000s and there was no social

444
00:21:46,769 --> 00:21:59,369
media at that time you know what I mean

445
00:21:49,200 --> 00:22:01,799
you had messenger and so I forgot

446
00:21:59,369 --> 00:22:04,979
Jamaica for us was probably our first

447
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:07,950
viral hit like a lot of numbers that we

448
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:09,960
least on our own I mean we experienced

449
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:12,630
it with diamond Platinum's last year

450
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:15,620
with a song called hallelujah that did a

451
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:17,790
million views in 12 hours it's a

452
00:22:15,619 --> 00:22:21,089
different world it's a different world

453
00:22:17,789 --> 00:22:24,808
today how they consume music and how and

454
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:27,000

two

467
00:22:52,440 --> 00:23:00,390

was the way it is now we're talking

471
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:12,779
about people going to jail what they

472
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:15,058

476
00:23:22,589 --> 00:23:26,399
the growth you know even now in the

477
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,669
state of New York that people can walk

478
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:32,970
into a pharmacy and get herb legally

479
00:23:29,669 --> 00:23:35,549

480
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:38,160
degrees like about fierce you know the

482
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:44,190
regards to how people view herb it's not

483
00:23:40,589 --> 00:23:49,230
something that you know is cliche or

484
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:51,090
only to niche only apply a certain image

485
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:52,740
because you have the Wall Street guys

486
00:23:51,089 --> 00:23:56,689
you have the college students you have

487
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:58,380
the purpose the yuppies the Latinos the

488
00:23:56,690 --> 00:24:03,840
african-americans the aisle and people

489
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:05,850
that Africans oh so how's that different

490
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:08,159
in than in Jamaica in terms so now we

491
00:24:05,849 --> 00:24:10,199
see it's mad accepted I mean I live on

492
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:11,790
the west coast you go to an office party

493
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,710
on the west coast people are smoking

494
00:24:11,789 --> 00:24:17,369
weed with their like cohorts it ain't no

495
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:18,779
thing but in Jamaica you know you guys

496
00:24:17,369 --> 00:24:23,129
have this kind of this English

497
00:24:18,779 --> 00:24:24,359
Commonwealth history and and and you

498
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:25,860
know it's like an Amsterdam you know

499
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:28,349
when I lived there twenty years ago and

500
00:24:25,859 --> 00:24:30,329
and and weed was you know quasi legal

501
00:24:28,349 --> 00:24:32,009
and all my friends were smoking and all

502
00:24:30,329 --> 00:24:33,839
this cuz smoke in the coffee shop some

503
00:24:32,009 --> 00:24:35,519
bars you can even smoke in but really

504
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:38,730
weed was still stigmatized by the

505
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:40,289
mainstream Dutch culture and you

506
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:42,299
couldn't smoke at an office party in

507
00:24:40,289 --> 00:24:43,740
Holland 20 years ago you know I got

508
00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:48,419
kicked off a train smoking some weed

509
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:50,819
once in Holland and you know I mean and

510
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:52,680
and I'd smoked all over in trains in

511
00:24:50,819 --> 00:24:54,869
Europe never done I got kicked off and

512
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:56,880
the Dutch Mac trip so I'm wondering if

513
00:24:54,869 --> 00:24:58,589
there's any of that like English

514
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,990
Commonwealth overflow this kind of

515
00:24:58,589 --> 00:25:02,579
proper thing in Jamaica where you know

516
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:04,019
you have their ass down one side and

517
00:25:02,579 --> 00:25:08,970
then you have you know you have your

518
00:25:04,019 --> 00:25:10,829
your your your political class in in

519
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:13,980
business class and the other what go on

520
00:25:10,829 --> 00:25:17,399
in in je a right now I'm curious well I

521
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:20,009
mean in Jamaica even when we moved to

522
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:25,800
Jamaica in the late nineties the vibe

523
00:25:20,009 --> 00:25:28,789
there was you know very tolerate it was

524
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:33,149
it was tolerated you know on low levels

525
00:25:28,789 --> 00:25:37,139
the only body that was being persecuted

526
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:40,080
for weed in in the 90s was you know

527
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:42,360
people that was being obvious with it

528
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:44,759
you know where the police can sit where

529
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:47,990
they get caught with it in their car but

530
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:50,279
for the most part you you can smoke weed

531
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:53,549
freely in Jamaica few years now even

532
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:56,789
before no you know 20 years later it's

533
00:25:53,549 --> 00:25:59,789
legal and you know there are shops where

534
00:25:56,789 --> 00:26:01,559
people can walk in and it's and purchase

535
00:25:59,789 --> 00:26:03,599
marijuana recreationally but the funny

536
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:09,269
thing about it is is just like Brooklyn

537
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:13,199
it was deemed to be a niche um drug you

538
00:26:09,269 --> 00:26:17,460
know where it was something done by

539
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:20,460
uptown people just like in in in America

540
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:22,710
it's it's some more affluent drug it was

541
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:24,390
never a thing in the hood Oh nobody in

542
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:27,539
the hood sniffing cocaine in Brooklyn

543
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:29,520
now you know I mean it was when crack

544
00:26:27,539 --> 00:26:30,899
was introduced that it got crazy but

545
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:32,759
people smoked marijuana

546
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:34,500
always in the

547
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:37,319
Brooklyn it was the same thing in

548
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:39,210
Jamaican nobody in a country a sniff

549
00:26:37,319 --> 00:26:43,409
quote you know I mean I heard man smoke

550
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:46,259
a country but up some people used to do

551
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:48,450
it too you know in their privacy and now

552
00:26:46,259 --> 00:26:51,450
culture exchange the culture is just

553
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:54,720
completely changed now you know and it's

554
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:57,090
not too different from what I have a

555
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:59,660
question you say that their shops in

556
00:26:57,089 --> 00:27:01,799
Jamaica where you can legally buy

557
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:09,660
recreational marijuana I didn't know

558
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:11,119
that change yeah the law passed but they

559
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:14,970
weren't selling it recreationally

560
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:17,729
medically yes recreationally not legally

561
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:21,809
rosters were distributed they were sort

562
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:23,970
of quasi allowed to but it wasn't have

563
00:27:21,809 --> 00:27:26,579
you ever seen illegal shops on the

564
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:28,890
recreational market you know what I

565
00:27:26,579 --> 00:27:31,199
would have to I just contacted bird eye

566
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:35,040
he used to be in the nomads and he owns

567
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:37,559
a spot in MoBay called Island vibes so

568
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:40,769
he's selling cannabis now whether it's

569
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:42,389
under the the medical cannabis banner or

570
00:27:40,769 --> 00:27:44,970
whether it's under a recreational banner

571
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:47,820
I'm not a hundred percent sure but I'm

572
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:50,910
pretty sure anyone over 18 or 19 can go

573
00:27:47,819 --> 00:27:53,039
into his shop and buy herb so it's it's

574
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:55,470
pretty it's it's pretty loose in the

575
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:57,359
sense of and like mojo was saying it's

576
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:59,880
not like the island was ever like a real

577
00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:01,919
it was only at roadblocks and airports

578
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:03,870
and like police stations that you kind

579
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:06,240
of had to be really careful about herb

580
00:28:03,869 --> 00:28:08,699
and pretty much anywhere else I mean

581
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,559
I'll never forget in my life driving

582
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:14,400
through a cane field with my friend

583
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:16,849
Vincent this was about 1995 I'm driving

584
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:19,700
through a cane field to get to a place

585
00:28:16,849 --> 00:28:23,069
what place was that roaring river

586
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:25,710
between savoir Mar and and Negril and

587
00:28:23,069 --> 00:28:27,750
beautiful beautiful place with beautiful

588
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:29,370
people and beautiful food and just like

589
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:33,660
one of my favorite places in the world

590
00:28:29,369 --> 00:28:35,609
actually right of course I did i I loved

591
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:37,380
Roaring River so but I was going through

592
00:28:35,609 --> 00:28:40,109
a cane field and Vincent was leading the

593
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:41,880
way and you know it was 2 or 3 o'clock

594
00:28:40,109 --> 00:28:43,199
in the afternoon it was that straight up

595
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:45,150
you know 3 o'clock

596
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,500
roadblock sort of thing and like we see

597
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:48,300
the roadblock and it

598
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,950
this little kind of gravel road and

599
00:28:48,299 --> 00:28:53,069
there you know down in the middle of the

600
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:56,880
cane field and we get up so close I can

601
00:28:53,069 --> 00:28:59,189
see the expressions on their face and he

602
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:01,050
basically stops me and he says hey you

603
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:02,460
got weed and I'm like yeah I got weed

604
00:29:01,049 --> 00:29:03,930
and he's like we'll throw it out and I'm

605
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:06,299
like right here they're looking at us

606
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:08,190
he's like just throw it out so I throw

607
00:29:06,299 --> 00:29:10,200
it out on the side of the road and he

608
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:13,950
kind of it we keep driving we get almost

609
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:15,930
right to them and he does like a 180 and

610
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:18,779
I'm like what the [ __ ]

611
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:21,090
so I do a 180 the cops are like staring

612
00:29:18,779 --> 00:29:23,430
at us like what the [ __ ] and we turn

613
00:29:21,089 --> 00:29:25,740
back around he goes over to my herb and

614
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:28,110
picks it up and gives it to me and then

615
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:30,390
we spent he says to me I know a better

616
00:29:28,109 --> 00:29:32,939
way and we start driving the in the

617
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:34,680
other direction and I was like holy [ __ ]

618
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:36,570
dude like where I'm from those cops

619
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:38,850
would have [ __ ] hailed us down and

620
00:29:36,569 --> 00:29:41,299
shook us down bro

621
00:29:38,849 --> 00:29:43,769
I couldn't believe they just stood there

622
00:29:41,299 --> 00:29:45,149
like at the roadblock they were just

623
00:29:43,769 --> 00:29:47,339
like whatever man if you're not gonna go

624
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:49,019
past we don't have a problem with you

625
00:29:47,339 --> 00:29:52,740
they watched us throw a baggie on the

626
00:29:49,019 --> 00:30:00,389
side of the road I mean [ __ ] job less

627
00:29:52,740 --> 00:30:04,019
Jamaica me and Rob Clark were trying to

628
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:06,120
be nasty , I rented a car we were

629
00:30:04,019 --> 00:30:10,829
driving having pajama and we were going

630
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:13,589
down to the coast and there's a

631
00:30:10,829 --> 00:30:18,179
roadblock and Rob says what are we gonna

632
00:30:13,589 --> 00:30:20,279
do we had ground up a hundred kilos of

633
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:22,650
weed and made a hundred and fifty grams

634
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:25,200
of the best Moroccan hash you've ever

635
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:27,000
seen in your life so he had half of it

636
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,900
in his pocket he threw it out the

637
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:33,180
[ __ ] window

638
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:37,410
me I put the metal to the foot to the

639
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:46,769
floor and just sped right past the cops

640
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:48,960
and just wave good Sam that's a I think

641
00:30:46,769 --> 00:30:51,150
it's important to hear stories like this

642
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:54,090
you know people have to know for all the

643
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:56,850
horrible life locked up stories for all

644
00:30:54,089 --> 00:30:58,769
the like nightmares like you know that's

645
00:30:56,849 --> 00:31:00,149
what I liked about NOLA did you ever

646
00:30:58,769 --> 00:31:01,769
talk to NOLA and shy

647
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:04,500
any of you guys in regards to his story

he gives me a warning ticket right he

711
00:33:35,038 --> 00:33:38,460
says ah you know thank you and I just

712
00:33:36,808 --> 00:33:40,859
looked at me and I said to him literally

713
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:43,259
I was through the stupidest son Jedi I

714
00:33:40,859 --> 00:33:47,548
and I thing I ever stayed in my life I

715
00:33:43,259 --> 00:33:56,639
was like you're letting us go my boys

716
00:33:47,548 --> 00:33:59,158
are like shut the [ __ ] up it's just like

717
00:33:56,638 --> 00:34:01,498
you know the authoritarian system the

718
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:04,109
institution the babylon system you know

719
00:34:01,499 --> 00:34:06,480
i mean you can doubt you could fall into

720
00:34:04,108 --> 00:34:08,128
it or you can if there's no method to

721
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,349
the madness it could be it could be

722
00:34:08,128 --> 00:34:12,000
arbitrary at times you know so i think

723
00:34:10,349 --> 00:34:15,599
we all have these stories where we got

724
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:18,030
caught by cops and with wheat and got

725
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:21,030
and got let go but then we all have the

726
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:23,730
other stories yep no doubt I got caught

727
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:25,260
in France and after I met Marcus at the

728

gonna put in the side but al dog is

809
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,950
seeing homeboy come in with the glove

810
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:31,589
too

811
00:37:28,949 --> 00:37:33,149
so comes in with the glove they did not

812
00:37:31,588 --> 00:37:35,909
go and said I wasn't gonna let them they

813
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:37,798
I said my shitty friend no I walk out

814
00:37:35,909 --> 00:37:39,149
the door al dogs freaked out and I

815
00:37:37,798 --> 00:37:41,210
looked at al dog I said it's not that

816
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:42,889
bad out dog I should have just Rast

817
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:45,289
but the situation was so I should have

818
00:37:42,889 --> 00:37:48,440
come out like like like like with a limp

819
00:37:45,289 --> 00:37:49,969
and [ __ ] but just that you know I went

820
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:52,250
in hindsight that would have been such

821
00:37:49,969 --> 00:37:53,659
the bomb you think there but I didn't it

822
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:54,739
was such a serious situation I said al

823
00:37:53,659 --> 00:37:57,469
it's not that bad

824
00:37:54,739 --> 00:38:00,889
so he goes in same thing happens we

825
00:37:57,469 --> 00:38:02,029
comes back right we get we get on in

826
00:38:00,889 --> 00:38:03,679

827
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:04,730

828
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:06,199

00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:08,179

830
00:38:06,199 --> 00:38:10,159

831
00:38:08,179 --> 00:38:12,349

832
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:16,099
drive the highways in Switzerland we're

833
00:38:12,349 --> 00:38:18,199
like ok bet and then we heat the do

834
00:38:16,099 --> 00:38:21,920
goats and the customs of the border guy

835
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:24,679
goes and gives this gram back to our dog

836
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,099
that's crazy and the same thing happened

837
00:38:24,679 --> 00:38:28,009
to me

838
00:38:25,099 --> 00:38:30,469
that's rephrase it but right so this

839
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:32,150
[ __ ] happens Europe is is definitely

840
00:38:30,469 --> 00:38:35,539
even more arbitrary with their with

841
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:38,119
their Constabulary and but then al dogs

842
00:38:35,539 --> 00:38:42,079
like what do you want me to do did and

843
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:43,359
and and and the guy says I want you to

844
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:46,130
throw it away

845
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:48,829
Alda we're just looking like that so al

846
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:50,480
dog can get he opens up the car he takes

847
00:38:48,829 --> 00:38:53,420
this little baggie there's a flagpole

848
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:55,789
right out there right and he goes and he

849
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:57,380
takes his little Grammy he throws it out

850
00:38:55,789 --> 00:38:58,909
and the gram falls out and he actually

851
00:38:57,380 --> 00:39:00,800
keeps the baggie right because he don't

852
00:38:58,909 --> 00:39:03,769
want a litter right so he comes back in

853
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:06,350
the car and they're like thank you very

854
00:39:03,769 --> 00:39:08,480
much and we go on so that was their

855
00:39:06,349 --> 00:39:11,029
disposal a way of disposed of taking our

856
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:13,460
[ __ ] is they just had a dog go and dump

857
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:15,350
it on the flagpole it was just the

858
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:17,809
weirdest thing and then after a whole

859
00:39:15,349 --> 00:39:19,039
[ __ ] ordeal we go into Switzerland

860
00:39:17,809 --> 00:39:21,889
and that's a whole other story that I

861
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:23,960
won't get into but that's yeah that's

862
00:39:21,889 --> 00:39:26,509
crazy man the guy packed the ball and

863
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:28,220
said he pushed it across the table and I

864
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:30,050
thought he was just look I thought I was

865
00:39:28,219 --> 00:39:33,319
in a lot of trouble man did you say he

866
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:35,870
packed the bowl he put the putt he put

867
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:39,140
the he took a little Nagi put it in the

868
00:39:35,869 --> 00:39:41,359
ball he pushed it across and I just

869
00:39:39,139 --> 00:39:43,219
looked at him and then he told me you

870
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:45,140
know it's crazy man they pitted the

871
00:39:43,219 --> 00:39:48,139
whole band against each other being like

872
00:39:45,139 --> 00:39:50,179
you had it and said you did it and then

873
00:39:48,139 --> 00:39:52,069
you know then of course he said you know

874
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:55,480
that I did it the band it was

875
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:59,570
unbelievable man it was you

876
00:39:55,480 --> 00:40:03,349
but yeah they they it's the way it is

877
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:05,510
cuz we're just trying to morning yawn

878
00:40:03,349 --> 00:40:08,858
the Swiss French Board I was in France

879
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:11,330
and I was going in to Switzerland so I

880
00:40:08,858 --> 00:40:13,819
forget I think I you know I actually

881
00:40:11,329 --> 00:40:15,949
forget if it was the the French customs

882
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:17,690
I think was the Swiss customs because

883
00:40:15,949 --> 00:40:20,480
they were switching to German and French

884
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:22,970
you know like like it was nothing so I'm

885
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,559
pretty sure with Swiss customs the

886
00:40:22,969 --> 00:40:27,799
French are just as bad

887
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:31,130
well the French are worse I mean I was

888
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:33,619
leaving France going into Germany I had

889
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:36,019
a t-shirt that had something about

890
00:40:33,619 --> 00:40:38,390
cannabis on it they completely

891
00:40:36,019 --> 00:40:42,980
strip-searched me and my wife and we

892
00:40:38,389 --> 00:40:44,629
didn't have anything zero well well

893
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:51,679
you're a lucky man because I'm going

894
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:53,420
through I'm walking in France 1999 going

895
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:55,669
to the supermarket me and my brothers

896
00:40:53,420 --> 00:41:03,349
and we get stopped by the police axe for

897
00:40:55,670 --> 00:41:05,690
our ID luckily we were we were on our

898
00:41:03,349 --> 00:41:08,509
way to Western you hit and had our

899
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:10,340
passwords in our pocket gave them the US

900
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:14,150
passports and they're like oh no these

901
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:15,980
are fake and we're like excuse me so we

902
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:17,599
go straight Springfield Massachusetts on

903
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:19,250
we don't even go Brooklyn Kahlua born in

904
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:21,858
Brooklyn educated in Springfield

905
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:23,420
Massachusetts so we switched up straight

906
00:41:21,858 --> 00:41:25,069
I'm like you're telling us that we're

907
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:27,409
not American sir would you like to go to

908

909
00:41:27,409 --> 00:41:34,969
and it it's it's sad but that would what

910
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:36,079
you just said Brett about them passing

911
00:41:34,969 --> 00:41:38,689
the weed back to you I'm getting

912
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:40,069

913
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:45,590
for him late nineties right you're

914
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:49,850
talking about yeah yeah man no sir

915
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:54,340
bro in 2012 I'm in France going from I'm

916
00:41:49,849 --> 00:41:54,339
injured Switzerland going from Geneva

917
00:41:54,789 --> 00:41:59,719
from from from a part of France right

918
00:41:57,650 --> 00:42:03,680
next to Switzerland to Geneva like you

919
00:41:59,719 --> 00:42:06,980
got a go through France it's weird the

920
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:08,779
way to hell just Geneva just that tiny

921
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:12,590
little thing that's basically almost

922
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:14,090
inscribed by the my friends you know

923
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:15,710
what I'm talking about it's like you go

924
00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:16,730
into France and you gotta come back and

925
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:18,199
you're going through a border while

926
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:22,429
driving in Switzerland so we go through

927
00:42:18,199 --> 00:42:24,409
this checkpoint and we did not have our

928
00:42:22,429 --> 00:42:27,649
passports on us we was going to perform

929
00:42:24,409 --> 00:42:33,440
had no weed they told us to get out of

930
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:36,200
the car had no paraphernalia and we had

931
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:38,960
to go inside give our names etc all

932
00:42:36,199 --> 00:42:43,899
these things and they had to find us in

933
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:48,079
a database just to prove that we were

934
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:51,130
not Africans trying to yeah

935
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:52,849
illegal migrate to Switzerland right

936
00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:53,900
right right

937
00:42:52,849 --> 00:42:56,989
well I mean I think that's an

938
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:59,780
interesting thing because when I moved

939
00:42:56,989 --> 00:43:01,549
to Europe you know I come from a big

940
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:03,890
city in America you know I grew up very

941
00:43:01,550 --> 00:43:07,190
multicultural II and then you go over to

942
00:43:03,889 --> 00:43:09,049
Europe and you see how this was 20 years

943
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:11,450
ago so it's it's a little bit different

944
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:14,240
now but like we lived in Amsterdam and

945
00:43:11,449 --> 00:43:18,169
so the black population in Amsterdam was

946
00:43:14,239 --> 00:43:19,789
a certain amis and it was it was weird I

947
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:21,500
just thought I will saw all these black

948
00:43:19,789 --> 00:43:23,059
guys all here everyone's got their some

949
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:24,320
black culture here but it's really

950
00:43:23,059 --> 00:43:26,269
different in Europe it's with the

951
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:28,039
Africana even certainly surname is not

952
00:43:26,269 --> 00:43:30,110
affricates it's it's south south south

953
00:43:28,039 --> 00:43:32,480
america but they were they were slaves

954
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:36,380
that Dutch took from Africa to take

955
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:39,050
discerner surname a long time ago until

956
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:41,420
you realise how the the Africans the

957
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:44,090
africana massives are treated in Europe

958
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:47,539
versus versus black culture in America

959
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:49,309
and it's completely different it's it's

960
00:43:47,539 --> 00:43:50,300
completely different I tell a lot of my

961
00:43:49,309 --> 00:43:51,980
black friends in America

962
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:54,230
hey goatee if you're complaining about

963
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:56,900
America [ __ ] go to Europe because it

964
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:59,840
is some straight bull [ __ ] like like

965
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:01,460
like yeah like and it is because of the

966
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:03,530
whole African thing that they they just

967
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:08,570
they they but once they know you're

968
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:09,920
American then yeah yeah they knew we

969
00:44:08,570 --> 00:44:11,539
were American just by the way we're

970
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:14,240
talking but like I mean I think you said

971
00:44:11,539 --> 00:44:16,880
it well and even till today because of

972
00:44:14,239 --> 00:44:17,939
all the situations you know happening in

973
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:20,640
northern Africa

974
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:23,358
these little things happen but you know

975
00:44:20,639 --> 00:44:25,650
for the most part it don't really

976
00:44:23,358 --> 00:44:27,838
rolling like that in Europe with

977
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:30,599
cannabis outside of the Netherlands so

978
00:44:27,838 --> 00:44:31,739
that you you you were extremely lucky my

979
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:33,088
friend put it that way

980
00:44:31,739 --> 00:44:37,379
well there's been times well I've been

981
00:44:33,088 --> 00:44:39,000
in prisons in Europe too so so uh and

982
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:41,010
there was a time I went to France from

983
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,989
Amsterdam once where I had I put a ball

984
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:45,510
of hash like a two grand ball hash in my

985
00:44:42,989 --> 00:44:48,088
fifth pocket in my Levi's and I get off

986
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:50,910
the train in Paris and and this little

987
00:44:48,088 --> 00:44:53,400
cute cuddly dog comes up to me and just

988
00:44:50,909 --> 00:44:55,980
sits down and I'm like oh another dog

989
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:58,559
shut down right next to me and then

990
00:44:55,980 --> 00:45:03,358
right behind his little dog is a police

991
00:44:58,559 --> 00:45:05,010
officer and she was she was she was she

992
00:45:03,358 --> 00:45:07,318

993
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:08,789
like nope she fully searched me it was

994
00:45:07,318 --> 00:45:10,980
only like two grams so it wasn't that

995
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:12,660
bulgy in my pocket right my fifth pocket

996
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:14,250
and she said I'm gonna search you she

997
00:45:12,659 --> 00:45:15,719
said you haven't I said no she says well

998
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:18,659

999
00:45:15,719 --> 00:45:21,298
tonight and I said no I don't have any

1000
00:45:18,659 --> 00:45:23,940

I Jedi and I and she goes in searches me

1002
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:29,849
and she did not find it and you know

1003
00:45:27,778 --> 00:45:31,858
there I was but that was just one other

1004
00:45:29,849 --> 00:45:33,838
time I almost went to [ __ ] in jail and

1005
00:45:31,858 --> 00:45:35,639
you know the thing about Europe is they

1006
00:45:33,838 --> 00:45:37,170
don't need probable there's no such

1007
00:45:35,639 --> 00:45:40,048
thing as probable cause in Europe I mean

1008
00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:42,059
I guess in America post-911 there ain't

1009
00:45:40,048 --> 00:45:43,409
you know stop and search whatever there

1010
00:45:42,059 --> 00:45:45,930
ain't no need for probable cause in

1011
00:45:43,409 --> 00:45:48,210
America now sadness yeah had have you

1012
00:45:45,929 --> 00:45:50,068
been through the the the Arizona stop

1013
00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:52,528
man I got stopped there with like

1014
00:45:50,068 --> 00:45:54,420
literally man I could I like unscrewed

1015
00:45:52,528 --> 00:45:56,579
the side of the inside of the bus and

1016
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:59,039
like put stuff two ounces in a turkey

1017
00:45:56,579 --> 00:46:01,680
bag and we had like four dogs on the bus

1018
00:45:59,039 --> 00:46:03,869
and this is like 10 years ago and and

1019
00:46:01,679 --> 00:46:06,328
they they took us off the whole band off

1020
00:46:03,869 --> 00:46:07,619
the bus searched all of us and they

1021
00:46:06,329 --> 00:46:11,818
didn't find anything I got a picture

1022
00:46:07,619 --> 00:46:12,960
with the dude so this was like I don't

1023
00:46:11,818 --> 00:46:14,880
know if you've been through their beat

1024
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:16,740
but that was one of the every time we

1025
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,869
knew it man we knew we're gonna get

1026
00:46:16,739 --> 00:46:21,358
singled out and they just they're just

1027
00:46:18,869 --> 00:46:24,809
like pulling up story that's kind of

1028
00:46:21,358 --> 00:46:28,230
interesting so this is in Holland in

1029
00:46:24,809 --> 00:46:30,569
Amsterdam or near after them and sapotes

1030
00:46:28,230 --> 00:46:31,349
have a lot of cannabis burned in

1031
00:46:30,568 --> 00:46:36,750
greenhouses

1032
00:46:31,349 --> 00:46:39,750
a lot of tones and they had to transport

1033
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:42,510
it to the manicuring and drive because

1034
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:47,099
they didn't want to drive manager I'm

1035
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:50,370
sorry it's not so a safe thing to do to

1036
00:46:47,099 --> 00:46:58,110
bring so many people so there's an

1037
00:46:50,369 --> 00:47:01,579
entire large van I mean a big man with a

1038
00:46:58,110 --> 00:47:04,050
few hundred large boxes each one with

1039
00:47:01,579 --> 00:47:08,009
freshly harvested branches you know

1040
00:47:04,050 --> 00:47:10,830
couple kilos in each box and they're

1041
00:47:08,010 --> 00:47:13,710
driving down the street on the freeway

1042
00:47:10,829 --> 00:47:17,909
and they get pulled over the driver it's

1043
00:47:13,710 --> 00:47:21,530
full of life and so he's gonna quit

1044
00:47:17,909 --> 00:47:23,399
what's gonna happen now the cop

1045
00:47:21,530 --> 00:47:27,330
immediately as soon as he got close to

1046
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:29,610
the man he opened up the back door he

1047
00:47:27,329 --> 00:47:33,869
looked inside of it he just heard oh

1048
00:47:29,610 --> 00:47:37,050
[ __ ] he closed the door and he goes well

1049
00:47:33,869 --> 00:47:39,690
I'm just gonna let you go this time he

1050
00:47:37,050 --> 00:47:41,810
didn't want to do all the paperwork the

1051
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:45,059
Dutch cops are mad cool I've had a few

1052
00:47:41,809 --> 00:47:49,829
cops thinking I was going down for sure

1053
00:47:45,059 --> 00:47:52,619
and the Dutch cops are definitely well

1054
00:47:49,829 --> 00:47:55,079
you gotta remember the Dutch cops a joke

1055
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:57,929
maybe the last 10 years they were

1056
00:47:55,079 --> 00:48:00,779
allowed to legally smoke cannabis when

1057
00:47:57,929 --> 00:48:03,569
they weren't on duty there was nothing

1058
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:05,400
prohibiting it now it's prohibited by

1059
00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:06,780
law was that because of the pressure

1060
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:09,570
from the Christian conservative

1061
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:18,690
government I don't know who put the

1062
00:48:09,570 --> 00:48:20,820
pressure on but Holland blastic well I

1063
00:48:18,690 --> 00:48:22,650
think you know we all have we all have

1064
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:24,510
like I said we all have those stories

1065
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:26,639
and there's no method to the madness

1066
00:48:24,510 --> 00:48:28,740
that's why the babylon system is just

1067
00:48:26,639 --> 00:48:30,569
like legalize all drugs because it's

1068
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:32,969
just a way to take control over people's

1069
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:34,440
lives and you know those those cops

1070
00:48:32,969 --> 00:48:35,969
didn't cares they were strip searching

1071
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:37,500
us after they found the gram in high

1072
00:48:35,969 --> 00:48:39,989
school Meza do you have a knife you have

1073
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:42,000
not you know it's like they just power

1074
00:48:39,989 --> 00:48:44,279
corrupts man you get little little

1075
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,940
Ranger Rick's in that in that in that

1076
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:48,600
position

1077
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:50,490
and you know shits gonna happen and and

1078
00:48:48,599 --> 00:48:56,519
you know all I can say is thank God for

1079
00:48:50,489 --> 00:48:59,219
a Constabulary discretion because you

1080
00:48:56,519 --> 00:49:03,210
know that discretion is what makes you

1081
00:48:59,219 --> 00:49:05,189
go down if you get a bad cop or stay out

1082
00:49:03,210 --> 00:49:08,340
keep your freedom if you got a good cop

1083
00:49:05,190 --> 00:49:10,050
and you know I'm not you know I'm I'm a

1084
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:12,960
public policy geek you know I guess my

1085
00:49:10,050 --> 00:49:15,510
degrees acting political science but but

1086
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:17,849
it you know there's legalizing all drugs

1087
00:49:15,510 --> 00:49:20,610
all over the world is the way to combat

1088
00:49:17,849 --> 00:49:23,639
that situation probably even more

1089
00:49:20,610 --> 00:49:25,349
importantly Alex that reason would be

1090
00:49:23,639 --> 00:49:27,089
the amount of like just here in

1091
00:49:25,349 --> 00:49:31,079
Vancouver alone fourteen hundred

1092
00:49:27,090 --> 00:49:32,640
overdoses last year all like dead there

1093
00:49:31,079 --> 00:49:34,739
were many many more overdoses that

1094
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:37,619
didn't die but those are all the ones

1095
00:49:34,739 --> 00:49:40,019
who passed away and that's an epidemic

1096
00:49:37,619 --> 00:49:41,869
so how many of those are on legal drugs

1097
00:49:40,019 --> 00:49:44,190
and not heroin how many of those are on

1098
00:49:41,869 --> 00:49:47,429
fentanyl and well you know what

1099
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:50,159
inevitably market was always fentanyl or

1100
00:49:47,429 --> 00:49:55,440
car front and all but but the person

1101
00:49:50,159 --> 00:49:58,049
always didn't know exactly so that's

1102
00:49:55,440 --> 00:50:00,300
part of the keeping the drugs illegal

1103
00:49:58,050 --> 00:50:01,740
thing that like yeah there's the whole

1104
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:04,050
thing that Alex mentioned but then

1105
00:50:01,739 --> 00:50:04,709
there's the actual aspect of Public

1106
00:50:04,050 --> 00:50:06,539
Safety

1107
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:08,849
the number one reason drug researcher in

1108
00:50:06,539 --> 00:50:12,079
America dr. Carl Hart from Columbia

1109
00:50:08,849 --> 00:50:14,699
University he is a very interesting

1110
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:17,519
character he's actually the first black

1111
00:50:14,699 --> 00:50:19,409
tenured professor for Columbia so if

1112
00:50:17,519 --> 00:50:22,289
that shows how long how far we still

1113
00:50:19,409 --> 00:50:25,139
need to come but he's a real interesting

1114
00:50:22,289 --> 00:50:26,639
cat and he's the one that you look at

1115
00:50:25,139 --> 00:50:29,759
what his studies say or what what he

1116
00:50:26,639 --> 00:50:31,650
espouses is is clearly drugs do need to

1117
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:33,390
be legal to and then you'll have fewer

1118
00:50:31,650 --> 00:50:36,630
deaths because he says the two main

1119
00:50:33,389 --> 00:50:39,389
reasons people overdose are that it's

1120
00:50:36,630 --> 00:50:40,860
it's either adulterated or they're

1121
00:50:39,389 --> 00:50:43,199
mixing it with something that they

1122
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:44,940
clearly shouldn't so when you get it

1123
00:50:43,199 --> 00:50:46,710
from us when you get some hair on from a

1124
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:48,539
street dealer they're not gonna be like

1125
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:50,940
oh don't mix this with fentanyl or

1126
00:50:48,539 --> 00:50:54,059
whatever so some people are still gonna

1127
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:55,380
you know you have overdoses and do you

1128
00:50:54,059 --> 00:50:58,559
know that shit's gonna happen this is

1129
00:50:55,380 --> 00:51:00,570
this it's a big world but

1130
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:03,269
but that's did some way more than just

1131
00:51:00,570 --> 00:51:05,519
heroin dude they put that they put it in

1132
00:51:03,269 --> 00:51:07,860
all sorts of powdered drugs well here's

1133
00:51:05,519 --> 00:51:09,509
a word for the wise - I think this

1134
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:11,940
happened last week there's a band called

1135
00:51:09,510 --> 00:51:14,700
Dark Star orchestra they're a Grateful

1136
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:18,059
Dead band that plays reproduced Grateful

1137
00:51:14,699 --> 00:51:19,859
Dead shows from from years gone by and I

1138
00:51:18,059 --> 00:51:21,119
want to say this was in Providence Rhode

1139
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:24,059
Island I think it was somewhere out here

1140
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:25,980
out east I'm not exactly sure but um

1141
00:51:24,059 --> 00:51:29,250
they stopped the show after the first

1142
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:31,920
set and the band left and anteed a venue

1143
00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:35,579
because there were four overdoses in the

1144
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:38,820
crowd someone was passing around a

1145
00:51:35,579 --> 00:51:40,380
fentanyl laced vape pen you know and

1146
00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:41,970
when you're at a music venue and someone

1147
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:45,750
passes you vape and you're like oh yeah

1148
00:51:41,969 --> 00:51:48,119
whatever some people just feel free but

1149
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:50,280
now you almost have to be careful whose

1150
00:51:48,119 --> 00:51:51,779
vape pen you suck off of it might have

1151
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:53,790
fentanyl and holy [ __ ]

1152
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:58,519
I'm not trying to suck off nobody's vape

1153
00:51:53,789 --> 00:52:01,289
pen except real holy [ __ ] man that is I

1154
00:51:58,519 --> 00:52:03,809
brought that whole suck off on the UM

1155
00:52:01,289 --> 00:52:06,570
the other person's vape pen I think vape

1156
00:52:03,809 --> 00:52:08,789
pen should be a personal thing I'm not

1157
00:52:06,570 --> 00:52:13,200
opposed to I think that's what you just

1158
00:52:08,789 --> 00:52:26,579

money shoulders to the wheel and let's

1187
00:53:47,789 --> 00:53:55,759
get going here so when you listen to

1188
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:55,759
that song it's a call for a revolution

1189
00:54:01,610 --> 00:54:09,300
ya know Steven things that right right I

1190
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:11,159
noticed it was warm in that I noticed

1191
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:16,830
that it was four minutes and 20 seconds

1192
00:54:11,159 --> 00:54:18,750
long Oh remix that's the jave vibe remix

1193
00:54:16,829 --> 00:54:21,179
that's like a nya being a version so

1194
00:54:18,750 --> 00:54:24,860
that one's sorts of put you in a trance

1195
00:54:21,179 --> 00:54:29,190
where the original version we sample

1196
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:31,800
caution Wailers album called the best of

1197
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:34,889
The Wailers coincidentally it's a song

1198
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:37,740
that Bob Marley sang lead on and we had

1199
00:54:34,889 --> 00:54:41,159
Stephen sing over his dad's part in the

1200
00:54:37,739 --> 00:54:42,479
record and Graham saying chorus you know

1201
00:54:41,159 --> 00:54:45,869
calling for freedom

1202
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:50,639
so as we speak about the transition the

1203
00:54:45,869 --> 00:54:52,259
world is making right now with cannabis

1204
00:54:50,639 --> 00:54:54,000
in the hemp industry there's still a lot

1205
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:55,800
of places where people will s still

1206
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,300
being locked up for it so that song is

1207
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:59,940
for those type of people and freedom

1208
00:54:57,300 --> 00:55:06,140
fighters you know all around the globe

1209
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:09,829
that is still a struggle as we can seen

1210
00:55:06,139 --> 00:55:09,829
the battles just begun

1211
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:17,119
it's unbelievable how much how much

1212
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:20,000
that's still fighting it you know the

1213
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:22,160
whoever the agenda the governments they

1214
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,858
just seem to be fighting this plant

1215
00:55:22,159 --> 00:55:28,639
right tooth and nail lasts down to the

1216
00:55:24,858 --> 00:55:30,619
last yeah it's wild Wow

1217
00:55:28,639 --> 00:55:33,289
mojo you got some prod you have you you

1218
00:55:30,619 --> 00:55:36,180
you still do in the CBD water and you

1219
00:55:33,289 --> 00:55:39,300
got anything new products or anything

1220
00:55:36,179 --> 00:55:39,299
[Music]

1221
00:55:39,309 --> 00:55:48,349
mojo the family has this arm Gramps has

1222
00:55:44,570 --> 00:55:51,140
this CBD line and that's the thing that

1223
00:55:48,349 --> 00:55:55,130
you know focused on a lot right now is

1224
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:59,659
the CBD element of the this Gold Rush

1225
00:55:55,130 --> 00:56:04,280
the green rush you know and I think it's

1226
00:55:59,659 --> 00:56:05,809
important that in engineering the

1227
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:07,400
recreational benefits and and

1228
00:56:05,809 --> 00:56:09,019
highlighting that I'm talking about that

1229
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:11,950
we need to really highlight and talk

1230
00:56:09,019 --> 00:56:15,079
about the medicinal benefits and how the

1231
00:56:11,949 --> 00:56:21,379
alternative to cannabis you know as a

1232
00:56:15,079 --> 00:56:25,639
sister called hemp you know doesn't come

1233
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:30,849
with the cycle components that with

1234
00:56:25,639 --> 00:56:34,940
undiminished of benefits far exceed that

1235
00:56:30,849 --> 00:56:38,480
THC so you know even though we know

1236
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:47,358
cannabis come with its CBD I think what

1237
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:49,429
my brother back in action is doing and

1238
00:56:47,358 --> 00:56:54,549
you know his mom being a scientist for

1239
00:56:49,429 --> 00:56:59,329
the US and then for me you know Riya

1240
00:56:54,550 --> 00:57:00,859
after she discovered the benefits of CBD

1241
00:56:59,329 --> 00:57:01,940
that was derived from him because she

1242
00:57:00,858 --> 00:57:03,409
could have messed with cannabis of

1243
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:08,720
course being an employee of the US

1244
00:57:03,409 --> 00:57:12,049
government and she really did a great

1245
00:57:08,719 --> 00:57:15,618
thing when she created her own tincture

1246
00:57:12,050 --> 00:57:17,420
and started feeding her son and the kid

1247
00:57:15,619 --> 00:57:21,350
is walking you know at two years old

1248
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:23,480
he's you know walking talking you know

1249
00:57:21,349 --> 00:57:24,769
in one of his eyes was closed down after

1250
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:26,900
the surgery

1251
00:57:24,769 --> 00:57:29,179
seeing out of both eyes and all of that

1252
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:31,010
is happening when the doctor said don't

1253
00:57:29,179 --> 00:57:32,989
be surprised if he doesn't even walk or

1254
00:57:31,010 --> 00:57:37,070
even make a sound before seven eight

1255
00:57:32,989 --> 00:57:40,399
years - told you no that's the thing we

1256
00:57:37,070 --> 00:57:42,860
can still that's why we've just begun

1257
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:44,960
you know people you know Rasta say or

1258
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:47,480
about a healing of the nation jack hair

1259
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:51,530
my mentor used to always say hemp will

1260
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:53,119
save the planet and you know and I just

1261
00:57:51,530 --> 00:57:55,100
saw a quote from Jack says I'm not sure

1262
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:59,389
if hemp will save the planet but it's

1263
00:57:55,099 --> 00:58:01,429
but it's the only thing that can and now

1264
00:57:59,389 --> 00:58:04,339
it's all about money look the legitimate

1265
00:58:01,429 --> 00:58:06,460
investment is now placed themselves into

1266
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:09,530
the cannabis industry there's huge

1267
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:11,599
multi-million dollar funds this is all

1268
00:58:09,530 --> 00:58:14,300
about money kid you not it's all about

1269
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:16,369
control over it and who gets to make the

1270
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:19,100
money has nothing to do with really

1271
00:58:16,369 --> 00:58:23,480
what's best for society of course

1272
00:58:19,099 --> 00:58:25,309
nothing ever does things then you can it

1273
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:28,280
still will find the benefit so for

1274
00:58:25,309 --> 00:58:29,150
example in aural okay let's call a spade

1275
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:32,780
a spade

1276
00:58:29,150 --> 00:58:35,329
what the DEA did is they moved CBD out

1277
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:39,650
of schedule one CBD comes from the

1278
00:58:35,329 --> 00:58:43,940
[ __ ] plant okay that has no medical

1279
00:58:39,650 --> 00:58:46,130
use come up with a compound that is that

1280
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:48,010
is curing these diseases or making these

1281
00:58:46,130 --> 00:58:50,869
diseases a lot better for the people

1282
00:58:48,010 --> 00:58:52,400
it's [ __ ] there is medical use for

1283
00:58:50,869 --> 00:58:55,250
the cannabis plant it's been established

1284
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:57,170
it's been proven by government funded

1285
00:58:55,250 --> 00:58:57,949
studies here and it's all about the

1286
00:58:57,170 --> 00:58:59,809
[ __ ] money

1287
00:58:57,949 --> 00:59:01,849
it's about john boehner and acreage

1288
00:58:59,809 --> 00:59:05,210
holdings and all those [ __ ] who

1289
00:59:01,849 --> 00:59:08,000
want the money going their way right not

1290
00:59:05,210 --> 00:59:12,829
about you know bringing the herb to the

1291
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:15,860
to reunify humans with the plan yeah i

1292
00:59:12,829 --> 00:59:17,989
see that in new york right now guys you

1293
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:22,519
know it's you walk around and it's CBD

1294
00:59:17,989 --> 00:59:30,199
everywhere misinformed care makes the

1295
00:59:22,519 --> 00:59:31,909
money i don't care i don't know but what

1296
00:59:30,199 --> 00:59:34,099
they need to do is they need to remove

1297
00:59:31,909 --> 00:59:36,199
cannabis from Schedule one if they

1298
00:59:34,099 --> 00:59:38,089
remove cannabis from Schedule one a lot

1299
00:59:36,199 --> 00:59:42,489
of things change and we're getting its

1300
00:59:38,090 --> 00:59:45,920
it's you know legality and and and the

1301
00:59:42,489 --> 00:59:48,589
biggest fraud the biggest fraud is that

1302
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:51,079
it exists in schedule one where the

1303
00:59:48,590 --> 00:59:54,200
definition of schedule one says no known

1304
00:59:51,079 --> 00:59:58,219
medical benefit how does the FDA approve

1305
00:59:54,199 --> 01:00:01,730
CBD for use on epilepsy if there's no

1306
00:59:58,219 --> 01:00:06,079
known benefit it's a [ __ ] scam it's a

1307
01:00:01,730 --> 01:00:08,360
[ __ ] choir there but here's that

1308
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:09,679
here's the caveat if they need to de

1309
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:12,470
schedule cannabis because if they

1310
01:00:09,679 --> 01:00:14,839
reschedule this and that's just gonna

1311
01:00:12,469 --> 01:00:16,969
give more that's gonna probably be

1312
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:19,100
farmable yeah remove it from the

1313
01:00:16,969 --> 01:00:21,230
schedule it's a medicated herb it's not

1314
01:00:19,099 --> 01:00:26,630
a plan and it should be regulated as

1315
01:00:21,230 --> 01:00:29,599
such absolute Amazo and it becomes

1316
01:00:26,630 --> 01:00:31,519
becomes dangerous that you know when we

1317
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:33,440
have all these terminologies moving at a

1318
01:00:31,519 --> 01:00:34,909
pop-culture level that are really act

1319
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:37,730
that aren't really grabbing a hold of

1320
01:00:34,909 --> 01:00:39,440
itself at that academic level it's it

1321
01:00:37,730 --> 01:00:41,960
can be very confusing in the long term

1322
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:45,470
so I understand you know the point of

1323
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:47,300
view but it's it's a tricky one here man

1324
01:00:45,469 --> 01:00:49,129
I will agree I see it here in New York

1325
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:51,170
where it's every corner it's like three

1326
01:00:49,130 --> 01:00:53,000
bucks for it in your coffee but it's

1327
01:00:51,170 --> 01:00:59,720
most of the time not really

1328
01:00:53,000 --> 01:01:02,989
full-spectrum cannabis and you know I

1329
01:00:59,719 --> 01:01:03,949
wish every policeman every Highway

1330
01:01:02,989 --> 01:01:09,799
patrolman

1331
01:01:03,949 --> 01:01:12,199
every prison officer to make much money

1332
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:15,140
involved of cannabis growing it legally

1333
01:01:12,199 --> 01:01:20,839
and they can all quit their jobs and

1334
01:01:15,139 --> 01:01:24,170
become you know it's gonna be really

1335
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:26,240
interesting to see what happens with GW

1336
01:01:24,170 --> 01:01:28,760
approval that padai elects here in the

1337
01:01:26,239 --> 01:01:31,009
states because you know the CBD business

1338
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:32,900
is is wrong or and there's no stopping

1339
01:01:31,010 --> 01:01:35,000
it the genies out of the bottle the

1340
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:36,800
toothpaste is out wait a sec I can't use

1341
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,989
that because there's a guy on YouTube

1342
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:42,289
who puts toothpaste back in the tube so

1343
01:01:38,989 --> 01:01:45,139
you know it just it's all about it's all

1344
01:01:42,289 --> 01:01:48,230
about control it's all about he controls

1345
01:01:45,139 --> 01:01:49,909
a commodity that people want everyone

1346
01:01:48,230 --> 01:01:50,880
knows this is a billion dollar industry

1347
01:01:49,909 --> 01:01:53,009
and I'm

1348
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:55,410
born with you Sam I'm not really saying

1349
01:01:53,009 --> 01:01:57,509
that people should make money on it but

1350
01:01:55,409 --> 01:02:00,509
I think if there's a hypocrisy that

1351
01:01:57,509 --> 01:02:03,420
exists within government today to keep

1352
01:02:00,509 --> 01:02:05,699
scanning cannabis on Schedule one while

1353
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:08,430
they take ever dialects which is nothing

1354
01:02:05,699 --> 01:02:10,588
more than a [ __ ] CBD t-shirt that

1355
01:02:08,429 --> 01:02:14,129
cost thirty five thousand dollars US a

1356
01:02:10,588 --> 01:02:18,739
year and move it to schedule five it's

1357
01:02:14,130 --> 01:02:24,240
[ __ ] up well you know I know the CBD

1358
01:02:18,739 --> 01:02:29,308
produces fairly well it's all going to

1359
01:02:24,239 --> 01:02:29,848
be does the same [ __ ] thing for ten

1360
01:02:29,309 --> 01:02:31,859
bucks

1361
01:02:29,849 --> 01:02:35,039
okay I guess that was another question

1362
01:02:31,858 --> 01:02:36,960
you know are the genetics you know is

1363
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:38,670
that really what what they're saying

1364
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:40,619
that that they have above and beyond

1365
01:02:38,670 --> 01:02:42,659
everyone else Sam is they're saying that

1366
01:02:40,619 --> 01:02:44,278
they hey listen we have we have Pro

1367
01:02:42,659 --> 01:02:46,949
Guinea we have the genetics to make this

1368
01:02:44,278 --> 01:02:49,108
this particular type of formulation that

1369
01:02:46,949 --> 01:02:55,588
nobody else has access to I mean it

1370
01:02:49,108 --> 01:03:01,230
seems to me is just a CTE Brian just

1371
01:02:55,588 --> 01:03:06,119
just the plant it's about 10% manicured

1372
01:03:01,230 --> 01:03:10,528
buds buds and it has very low low THC

1373
01:03:06,119 --> 01:03:14,130
I mean it's point zero something so it's

1374
01:03:10,528 --> 01:03:16,349
really low so here's the deal they're

1375
01:03:14,130 --> 01:03:18,358
gonna [ __ ] everything up okay we know

1376
01:03:16,349 --> 01:03:19,920
it's all gonna get [ __ ] up that's not

1377
01:03:18,358 --> 01:03:21,328
a news flash that's nothing new I

1378
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:25,880
produce the biggest business-to-business

1379
01:03:21,329 --> 01:03:28,920
cannabis event in Europe in Berlin and

1380
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:30,568
what I tell people so I see it all man I

1381
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:31,980
deal with the big guys I deal with the

1382
01:03:30,568 --> 01:03:33,659
little guys from the street to the

1383
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:35,789
boardroom that's how Jedi and I are oh

1384
01:03:33,659 --> 01:03:37,710
you know and so and that's just and I

1385
01:03:35,789 --> 01:03:40,109
like it that way right cuz you keep your

1386
01:03:37,710 --> 01:03:41,818
ear to everyone's everyone's cypher you

1387
01:03:40,108 --> 01:03:43,679
know I'm saying but what I tell folks

1388
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:46,679
when I when I when I get up at the

1389
01:03:43,679 --> 01:03:48,960
beginning to kind of just bring the Nair

1390
01:03:46,679 --> 01:03:52,139
you know create the narrative that

1391
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:53,730
that's more like on on my level as I say

1392
01:03:52,139 --> 01:03:55,108
every administrators your politicians

1393
01:03:53,730 --> 01:03:57,778
this is what I said the very first time

1394
01:03:55,108 --> 01:03:59,130
in Germany and they were taken aback but

1395
01:03:57,778 --> 01:04:00,358
they had to hear it I said your

1396
01:03:59,130 --> 01:04:01,920
politicians your administrators are

1397
01:04:00,358 --> 01:04:03,659
gonna [ __ ] everything up that's clear

1398
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:04,349
they're gonna that they're gonna do that

1399
01:04:03,659 --> 01:04:06,088
from

1400
01:04:04,349 --> 01:04:08,190
me the most important thing is and this

1401
01:04:06,088 --> 01:04:11,190
is what I tell when I go into a brand

1402
01:04:08,190 --> 01:04:13,200
new market like it like Germany was

1403
01:04:11,190 --> 01:04:15,479
especially when we did the first ICBC in

1404
01:04:13,199 --> 01:04:17,159
Berlin I said the most important thing

1405
01:04:15,478 --> 01:04:19,858
is that we end criminal penalties

1406
01:04:17,159 --> 01:04:22,409
towards cannabis and you have a everyone

1407
01:04:19,858 --> 01:04:25,139
can have a robust home garden so if they

1408
01:04:22,409 --> 01:04:27,509
legalize cannabis you know and then you

1409
01:04:25,139 --> 01:04:30,568
don't have and but you can't have a home

1410
01:04:27,509 --> 01:04:32,728
garden then the fight is not over you

1411
01:04:30,568 --> 01:04:36,719
know but the middle as cannabis and

1412
01:04:32,728 --> 01:04:39,179
criminal penalties are ended and you can

1413
01:04:36,719 --> 01:04:41,848
have a robust home garden then I'm in

1414
01:04:39,179 --> 01:04:45,478
for whatever's clever and organ is

1415
01:04:41,849 --> 01:04:48,809
organs a great example of that where not

1416
01:04:45,478 --> 01:04:50,699
only we had have we reduced like heavily

1417
01:04:48,809 --> 01:04:52,559
crimped like I could somebody could sell

1418
01:04:50,699 --> 01:04:54,358
someone a pound on the street in Oregon

1419
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:57,298
not have a license or anything and it's

1420
01:04:54,358 --> 01:04:58,679
not a felony you know and so this is

1421
01:04:57,298 --> 01:04:59,909
what I've got to see this I've got to

1422
01:04:58,679 --> 01:05:01,818
I've been fortunate enough to live in

1423
01:04:59,909 --> 01:05:05,068
Oregon and see this microcosmic

1424
01:05:01,818 --> 01:05:07,650
utopian example of what's going on with

1425
01:05:05,068 --> 01:05:09,900
the of with cannabis in terms of that

1426
01:05:07,650 --> 01:05:12,660
ending criminal ten of these robust home

1427
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:15,210
garden and then I use that as an analogy

1428
01:05:12,659 --> 01:05:17,670
when I when I travel around the world

1429
01:05:15,210 --> 01:05:20,039
and and talk to people because I you

1430
01:05:17,670 --> 01:05:22,229
know you can you can talk about the the

1431
01:05:20,039 --> 01:05:24,210
ins and outs and how it's gonna be but

1432
01:05:22,228 --> 01:05:26,788
you know that's gonna that a nickel

1433
01:05:24,210 --> 01:05:28,409
might get you a cup of coffee so for me

1434
01:05:26,789 --> 01:05:31,140
it's like break it down to the you know

1435
01:05:28,409 --> 01:05:33,358
get root occur on things and and say

1436
01:05:31,139 --> 01:05:35,489
what's really important for me home

1437
01:05:33,358 --> 01:05:37,348
garden ending criminal penalties the

1438
01:05:35,489 --> 01:05:39,509
conversation ends there and even though

1439
01:05:37,349 --> 01:05:41,338
I am a cannabis business person I look

1440
01:05:39,509 --> 01:05:44,039
at things I look at because I'm a

1441
01:05:41,338 --> 01:05:46,469
disciple that Jack hare I look at things

1442
01:05:44,039 --> 01:05:48,630
from a consumer perspective right and so

1443
01:05:46,469 --> 01:05:51,420
I just look things from the average mug

1444
01:05:48,630 --> 01:05:53,670
so in Oregon now you can get top weed

1445
01:05:51,420 --> 01:05:55,619
for like two bucks a gram it's it's

1446
01:05:53,670 --> 01:05:57,269
crazy right and all the growers are

1447
01:05:55,619 --> 01:05:58,739
complaining right but I don't care

1448
01:05:57,268 --> 01:06:00,659
because all that money was made off of

1449
01:05:58,739 --> 01:06:02,429
prohibition anyway what I care about is

1450
01:06:00,659 --> 01:06:04,379
getting the best product for the best

1451
01:06:02,429 --> 01:06:07,379
price when I was twenty I was buying

1452
01:06:04,380 --> 01:06:08,789
$400 ounces in northern Cali and I was

1453
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:11,099
feeling like a drug addict because I was

1454
01:06:08,789 --> 01:06:14,039
I was buying the weed before I'd buy my

1455
01:06:11,099 --> 01:06:16,369
[ __ ] bread right and that was dread

1456
01:06:14,039 --> 01:06:18,109
right so what go on now in Oregon

1457
01:06:16,369 --> 01:06:19,640
everybody

1458
01:06:18,108 --> 01:06:22,759
everybody can smoke you know I'm saying

1459
01:06:19,639 --> 01:06:24,798
and it's cheap it's good it's safe and

1460
01:06:22,759 --> 01:06:27,259
they don't got us they can have their

1461
01:06:24,798 --> 01:06:28,998
own home garden I know multiple cats who

1462
01:06:27,259 --> 01:06:31,309
aren't in the weed game but have their

1463
01:06:28,998 --> 01:06:32,899
four plants that's not what I would call

1464
01:06:31,309 --> 01:06:34,789
a robust card and we'd like to make that

1465
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:37,639
more you can't get your medical

1466
01:06:34,789 --> 01:06:38,749
marijuana card and grow like 12 but and

1467
01:06:37,639 --> 01:06:41,088
that's just like a couple hundred bucks

1468
01:06:38,748 --> 01:06:42,949
more but I know a million people who are

1469
01:06:41,088 --> 01:06:44,509
just growing a liquor license and then

1470
01:06:42,949 --> 01:06:46,189
they they're just they got the whole

1471
01:06:44,509 --> 01:06:47,389
year's worth of items from their four

1472
01:06:46,190 --> 01:06:50,690
plants because we have such a great

1473
01:06:47,389 --> 01:06:52,489
growing climate out here so I basically

1474
01:06:50,690 --> 01:06:52,849
that's what I tell folks all around the

1475
01:06:52,489 --> 01:06:54,619
world

1476
01:06:52,849 --> 01:06:56,390
everyone's gonna [ __ ] [ __ ] up we know

1477
01:06:54,619 --> 01:06:58,160
that it's not a news flash so what are

1478
01:06:56,389 --> 01:07:01,338
we gonna still schedule one listing of

1479
01:06:58,159 --> 01:07:04,759
cannabis is really hurting Oregon in the

1480
01:07:01,338 --> 01:07:07,308
following way Oregon produces way more

1481
01:07:04,759 --> 01:07:10,400
than they could possibly smoke as a

1482
01:07:07,309 --> 01:07:12,528
single state populous when when cannabis

1483
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:13,999
is no longer on Schedule one and we

1484
01:07:12,528 --> 01:07:16,400
could do state to state commerce

1485
01:07:13,998 --> 01:07:19,909
Oregon's going to be a major player in

1486
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:21,680
producing quality herb that can go all

1487
01:07:19,909 --> 01:07:22,098
over the country is not all over the

1488
01:07:21,679 --> 01:07:25,578
world

1489
01:07:22,099 --> 01:07:28,640
it's a Schedule one hang up here that's

1490
01:07:25,579 --> 01:07:33,170
basically keeping Oregon's industry in

1491
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:34,818
the dump and and making growers be poor

1492
01:07:33,170 --> 01:07:36,559
that where they can't you know afford

1493
01:07:34,818 --> 01:07:37,038
their bills can't afford to do this

1494
01:07:36,559 --> 01:07:38,720
anymore

1495
01:07:37,039 --> 01:07:41,210
I know people who have gotten out of the

1496
01:07:38,719 --> 01:07:43,248
cannabis industry in Oregon because the

1497
01:07:41,210 --> 01:07:44,568
the regulation was so crazy that they

1498
01:07:43,248 --> 01:07:48,828
were gonna they were gonna lose all

1499
01:07:44,568 --> 01:07:50,389
their money easy to get in the game in

1500
01:07:48,829 --> 01:07:51,739
Oregon but it's hard to then sell your

1501
01:07:50,389 --> 01:07:53,598
weed once you grow up because all the

1502
01:07:51,739 --> 01:07:55,579
food grows in scale then now it's 300

1503
01:07:53,599 --> 01:07:58,849
bucks a pound so that's the issue and

1504
01:07:55,579 --> 01:08:00,950
yes you're correct that when when when

1505
01:07:58,849 --> 01:08:04,249
when when it's when it's rescheduled

1506
01:08:00,949 --> 01:08:06,498
their D schedule then there will be a

1507
01:08:04,248 --> 01:08:10,759
whole nother conduit in fact there's a

1508
01:08:06,498 --> 01:08:12,949
big I'm supporting a big bill that we're

1509
01:08:10,759 --> 01:08:16,789
trying to get past that already does

1510
01:08:12,949 --> 01:08:18,920
that and allows for Oregon to export so

1511
01:08:16,789 --> 01:08:21,350
when it is so when the government does

1512
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:23,389
give it oh okay that Oregon will be able

1513
01:08:21,350 --> 01:08:27,859
to hit the ground running and so that's

1514
01:08:23,389 --> 01:08:31,079
a problem you nail on ahead exactly why

1515
01:08:27,859 --> 01:08:32,700
the CBD rush is going on right now

1516
01:08:31,079 --> 01:08:35,279
I think one of the reasons why people

1517
01:08:32,699 --> 01:08:36,838
are growing CBD even in legal states is

1518
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:39,509
because you know a much larger

1519
01:08:36,838 --> 01:08:42,539
addressable market you're more likely to

1520
01:08:39,510 --> 01:08:46,170
be profitable if you're growing CBD

1521
01:08:42,539 --> 01:08:49,350
because you can you know basically sell

1522
01:08:46,170 --> 01:08:51,300
those products anywhere you know a lot

1523
01:08:49,350 --> 01:08:52,320
of my boys adapted who are just yeah

1524
01:08:51,300 --> 01:08:54,390
growers or whatever

1525
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:55,949
now they got now they got acres of

1526
01:08:54,390 --> 01:08:57,780
[ __ ] hemp and you're selling the CBD

1527
01:08:55,949 --> 01:09:00,809
and they're not as regulated and it's uh

1528
01:08:57,779 --> 01:09:02,130
there was a great pivot for them we're

1529
01:09:00,810 --> 01:09:04,140
seeing that in New York in New York

1530
01:09:02,130 --> 01:09:07,588
State in Massachusetts now I mean I have

1531
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:09,329
a license in Massachusetts and you know

1532
01:09:07,588 --> 01:09:10,890
that market in itself is so different

1533
01:09:09,329 --> 01:09:13,739
than the west coast because it's just

1534
01:09:10,890 --> 01:09:16,410
coming online at such a new time but

1535
01:09:13,739 --> 01:09:17,729
it's you know it I see us got you know

1536
01:09:16,409 --> 01:09:19,229
the Massachusetts mark you go on the

1537
01:09:17,729 --> 01:09:21,358
same way everything's gonna drop once

1538
01:09:19,229 --> 01:09:23,879
everybody comes online and it's an

1539
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:26,190
inevitable balance balancing act that we

1540
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:28,319
have to play at this point but it's uh

1541
01:09:26,189 --> 01:09:30,419
you know we have a lot to learn from

1542
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:33,029
each other all over the place you know I

1543

01:11:52,079 --> 01:12:06,930
father of the Morgan heritage had like

1588
01:11:55,439 --> 01:12:08,549
was it like 40 children just not more

1589

than 20 or 30 like he has a lot of

1590
01:12:08,550 --> 01:12:13,680
children it's a huge crew that's that

1594

down-to-earth root they are the real

1595
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:30,660
deal

1596
01:12:27,149 --> 01:12:32,939
no fake to the front it is they've been

1597
01:12:30,659 --> 01:12:34,979
a pleasure to work with over the years

1598
01:12:32,939 --> 01:12:36,269
for me and you know I only work with a

1599
01:12:34,979 --> 01:12:37,739
few different crews that's why I always

1600
01:12:36,270 --> 01:12:39,480
worked with hieroglyphics because I was

1601
01:12:37,739 --> 01:12:41,369
working with a lot of hip-hop crews and

1602
01:12:39,479 --> 01:12:44,429
then I realized I just want to work with

1603
01:12:41,369 --> 01:12:46,859
Jairo because they're just such roots

1604
01:12:44,430 --> 01:12:50,730
you know down-to-earth folk so I can't

1605
01:12:46,859 --> 01:12:53,819
say enough about old Morgan heritage

1606
01:12:50,729 --> 01:12:57,419
family 29 children my bad

1607
01:12:53,819 --> 01:13:00,238
it was a lot though it's amazing

1608
01:12:57,420 --> 01:13:03,179
it should have more quite a few he

1609
01:13:00,238 --> 01:13:07,408
breeds the best on the planet probably

1610
01:13:03,179 --> 01:13:09,329
we don't all have 29 children well you

1611
01:13:07,408 --> 01:13:09,868
know we all can't do that that's for

1612
01:13:09,329 --> 01:13:12,630
sure

1613
01:13:09,868 --> 01:13:16,469
but that's the that's the spice of life

1614
01:13:12,630 --> 01:13:18,060
on this planet you know I have three and

1615
01:13:16,469 --> 01:13:21,239
that I'm pretty overwhelmed with that

1616
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:27,320
like I got one breaking my balls on the

1617
01:13:21,238 --> 01:13:31,618
daily lover to death oh yeah I got two

1618
01:13:27,319 --> 01:13:32,939
yes Dean 21 they it's it the problems

1619
01:13:31,618 --> 01:13:35,009
only get bigger when they get older

1620
01:13:32,939 --> 01:13:37,859
that's what I've been told I'm like oh

1621
01:13:35,010 --> 01:13:41,460
my god that's not true mark I mean I've

1622
01:13:37,859 --> 01:13:46,139
got 135 and 141 and problems get less

1623
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:47,969
every year all the problems between 20

1624
01:13:46,139 --> 01:13:52,500
and 30 and then figure your [ __ ] out

1625
01:13:47,969 --> 01:13:57,000
time yeah you're in a parabolic function

1626
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:59,698
you know as it is close as age increases

1627
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:02,698
yeah they become less dependent on you

1628
01:13:59,698 --> 01:14:04,979
and you know when they're young it's you

1629
01:14:02,698 --> 01:14:07,738
know being a parent is it certainly

1630
01:14:04,979 --> 01:14:10,319
takes a lot of work my girls were never

1631
01:14:07,738 --> 01:14:14,359
depended on me they wanted to as soon as

1632
01:14:10,319 --> 01:14:26,429
they could move out and get on their own

1633
01:14:14,359 --> 01:14:28,219
well they got your skunk smell that

1634
01:14:26,429 --> 01:14:30,899
would do it

1635
01:14:28,219 --> 01:14:33,118
you know the kids are happy food now the

1636
01:14:30,899 --> 01:14:47,158
kids do hippies who who never smoked

1637
01:14:33,118 --> 01:14:50,880
weed and they're doubt I was I was

1638
01:14:47,158 --> 01:14:54,920
complaining about the nation's both

1639
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:56,520
worked at my greenhouse occasionally we

1640
01:14:54,920 --> 01:14:58,139
Pennsylvania where there's a lot of

1641
01:14:56,520 --> 01:15:00,150
mushrooms you know the little white

1642
01:14:58,139 --> 01:15:01,679
button mushrooms and I know if you know

1643
01:15:00,149 --> 01:15:04,079
how those are cultivated they basically

1644
01:15:01,679 --> 01:15:05,279
grow on sawdust and horseshit you

1645
01:15:04,079 --> 01:15:08,210
talking about cannon Square Pennsylvania

1646
01:15:05,279 --> 01:15:08,210
man yes

1647
01:15:08,909 --> 01:15:15,869
I know that place really well yeah so so

1648
01:15:13,050 --> 01:15:18,270
one day I walked into my chiropractor's

1649
01:15:15,869 --> 01:15:21,210
office who had an open office so all the

1650
01:15:18,270 --> 01:15:23,430
patients were everyone on there and the

1651
01:15:21,210 --> 01:15:24,989
smell was just so thick outside that

1652
01:15:23,430 --> 01:15:28,710
when I walked into the office I'm like

1653
01:15:24,989 --> 01:15:30,599
oh god that mushroom smell holy [ __ ]

1654
01:15:28,710 --> 01:15:33,689
well I didn't realize this but one of

1655
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:35,550
the patients when I was the owner of a

1656
01:15:33,689 --> 01:15:37,379
mushroom business and he looked up off

1657
01:15:35,550 --> 01:15:39,300
the chiropractor bed and looked up at me

1658
01:15:37,380 --> 01:15:41,400
and said you smell that and I said yeah

1659
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:45,380
he said that's the smell of money

1660
01:15:41,399 --> 01:15:51,929
[Laughter]

1661
01:15:45,380 --> 01:15:53,730
good people Mexicans that come out and

1662
01:15:51,930 --> 01:15:55,770
work those mushroom houses because again

1663
01:15:53,729 --> 01:15:58,769
I don't know anybody else who would

1664
01:15:55,770 --> 01:16:01,110
possibly do that work good outdoor a

1665
01:15:58,770 --> 01:16:02,610
region to that part that's particularly

1666
01:16:01,109 --> 01:16:06,210
part of Pennsylvania is really good for

1667
01:16:02,609 --> 01:16:09,630
outdoor when that bill there's a lot a

1668
01:16:06,210 --> 01:16:11,550
lot now be a lot of half being grown in

1669
01:16:09,630 --> 01:16:14,279
Pennsylvania you know not too far from

1670
01:16:11,550 --> 01:16:16,500
where I live sort of like the cradle of

1671
01:16:14,279 --> 01:16:19,170
the hemp industry during the 13 colonies

1672
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:20,279
I believe William Penn taxes farmers for

1673
01:16:19,170 --> 01:16:22,590
not growing hemp

1674
01:16:20,279 --> 01:16:25,079
if you didn't grow have because what did

1675
01:16:22,590 --> 01:16:27,989
her Majesty need to conquer the world

1676
01:16:25,079 --> 01:16:31,050
she needed ships and so ships are driven

1677
01:16:27,989 --> 01:16:34,500
on sails and ropes and everything else

1678
01:16:31,050 --> 01:16:35,909
they can be derived from hemp so it's

1679
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:37,170
good to see it coming back to

1680
01:16:35,909 --> 01:16:39,720
Pennsylvania we're putting in an

1681
01:16:37,170 --> 01:16:42,539
application to grow a hundred acres next

1682
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:45,690
year at my friend's company okay yeah

1683
01:16:42,539 --> 01:16:48,989
we're gonna putting it into food into

1684
01:16:45,689 --> 01:16:50,639
dairy we're gonna just I believe CBD is

1685
01:16:48,989 --> 01:16:53,849
the vitamin C of the future and

1686
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:56,130
everything from baby formula the

1687
01:16:53,850 --> 01:16:58,500
geriatric medicine and everything in

1688
01:16:56,130 --> 01:17:03,060
between will be fortified with CBD in

1689
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:09,300
the future believe it yep it'll be

1690
01:17:03,060 --> 01:17:12,450
scuffed man Sam's biggest nightmare for

1691
01:17:09,300 --> 01:17:15,420
personal use but I was happy enough to

1692
01:17:12,449 --> 01:17:18,539
develop the first high CBD variety so I

1693
01:17:15,420 --> 01:17:23,699
mean it's all your father I see it

1694
01:17:18,539 --> 01:17:26,529
useful for people if they enjoy it

1695
01:17:23,698 --> 01:17:27,219
well you know different smokes for

1696
01:17:26,529 --> 01:17:28,840
different

1697
01:17:27,219 --> 01:17:33,788
what if it was in everything and you

1698
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:42,760
could no longer get high then I think I

1699
01:17:33,788 --> 01:17:44,649
would now do you think do you think CBD

1700
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:46,420
Sam has been something that we've just

1701
01:17:44,649 --> 01:17:48,488
overlooked for a long time and it's just

1702
01:17:46,420 --> 01:17:50,229
been under our noses the whole time and

1703
01:17:48,488 --> 01:17:53,379
is there a particular reason why we

1704
01:17:50,229 --> 01:17:58,389
didn't study it my variety more than 20

1705
01:17:53,380 --> 01:18:02,699
years ago we were looking at and it's

1706
01:17:58,389 --> 01:18:02,699
been there a lot longer than that yeah

1707
01:18:03,630 --> 01:18:14,469
CBD you don't get more than one there's

1708
01:18:09,399 --> 01:18:15,998
varieties and and I just I guess just

1709
01:18:14,469 --> 01:18:17,529
for sacred conversation you know because

1710
01:18:15,998 --> 01:18:19,899
it's a single species do you think it's

1711
01:18:17,529 --> 01:18:23,139
a true mutation of this cannabis sativa

1712
01:18:19,899 --> 01:18:26,439
L or is it is it something that what

1713
01:18:23,139 --> 01:18:29,739
that really is bred and selected or is

1714
01:18:26,439 --> 01:18:31,089
it really you know how does how does you

1715
01:18:29,738 --> 01:18:33,518
know when you were first starting with

1716
01:18:31,090 --> 01:18:34,719
that I just out of curiosity how did you

1717
01:18:33,519 --> 01:18:37,360
get down to the selection process

1718
01:18:34,719 --> 01:18:40,179
because it's so fascinating well with a

1719
01:18:37,359 --> 01:18:43,658
breeding program I was able to create

1720
01:18:40,179 --> 01:18:46,538
varieties that were pure CBD pure THC

1721
01:18:43,658 --> 01:18:54,748
that's easy one Lots partners worldwide

1722
01:18:46,538 --> 01:18:59,889
for years but also cbc CB g g8 cv c GP

1723
01:18:54,748 --> 01:19:03,158
CB CB so i can produce with breeding

1724
01:18:59,889 --> 01:19:07,328
plants that basically produce large

1725
01:19:03,158 --> 01:19:09,728
amounts of only one single yeah and so

1726
01:19:07,328 --> 01:19:11,849
the biochemical basis for that is the

1727
01:19:09,729 --> 01:19:14,110
fact that there's different varieties

1728
01:19:11,849 --> 01:19:15,670
different expression levels of the

1729
01:19:14,109 --> 01:19:18,098
synthesis that are the basically the

1730
01:19:15,670 --> 01:19:19,630
molecular machinery in the plant that

1731
01:19:18,099 --> 01:19:22,869
actually make those those final

1732
01:19:19,630 --> 01:19:26,050
compounds and so in some cases there's

1733
01:19:22,868 --> 01:19:28,089
what are called knockouts where the the

1734
01:19:26,050 --> 01:19:29,529
way that the the gene codes for the

1735
01:19:28,090 --> 01:19:31,300
protein that's made from it or the

1736
01:19:29,529 --> 01:19:33,759
enzyme that's made there's like a

1737
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:34,369
mutation that's made and for some reason

1738
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:36,918
now you have a

1739
01:19:34,368 --> 01:19:38,469
dysfunctional enzyme I think that you

1740
01:19:36,918 --> 01:19:41,779
know Sam has always said that about

1741
01:19:38,469 --> 01:19:44,529
about CBD synthase in Scott number one

1742
01:19:41,779 --> 01:19:52,279
it's dysfunctional if for some reason

1743
01:19:44,529 --> 01:19:55,219
it's not correct on in others arrive yes

1744
01:19:52,279 --> 01:19:57,828
about in other varieties those synthesis

1745
01:19:55,219 --> 01:20:00,498
are upregulated at the expense of other

1746
01:19:57,828 --> 01:20:04,609
synthesis being down regulated you know

1747
01:20:00,498 --> 01:20:07,219
in my genome is really is also that all

1748
01:20:04,609 --> 01:20:10,759
varieties do not have vaults in phases

1749
01:20:07,219 --> 01:20:13,550
that's right so you've got to have this

1750
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:15,800
in place expressed in large amounts if

1751
01:20:13,550 --> 01:20:18,529
you're talking about plus you need the

1752
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:21,619
sites of production resins for hours and

1753
01:20:18,529 --> 01:20:23,569
then and then on the on the topic of

1754
01:20:21,618 --> 01:20:26,618
enzyme production did you see any

1755
01:20:23,569 --> 01:20:30,319
enzymatic biotransformation of terpenes

1756
01:20:26,618 --> 01:20:32,268
as bio active agents overall meaning the

1757
01:20:30,319 --> 01:20:35,988
the way that they they change in the

1758
01:20:32,269 --> 01:20:38,418
environment the cannabinoid pathway in

1759
01:20:35,988 --> 01:20:41,148
and of itself answers your question

1760
01:20:38,418 --> 01:20:44,448
okay an Avenue pathway involves the

1761
01:20:41,149 --> 01:20:48,349
marriage of a terpene precursor with a

1762
01:20:44,448 --> 01:20:49,848
phenol that essentially makes CBG a sure

1763
01:20:48,349 --> 01:20:51,489
so that answers your question right

1764
01:20:49,849 --> 01:20:53,449
there I mean the biochemical

1765
01:20:51,488 --> 01:20:56,718
transformation that happens in the

1766
01:20:53,448 --> 01:20:59,719
cannabinoid biosynthetic pathway is is

1767
01:20:56,719 --> 01:21:02,090
terpene driven okay that there that

1768
01:20:59,719 --> 01:21:03,319
repeat driven I like it yeah I just

1769
01:21:02,090 --> 01:21:05,869
wanted to because I've been reading a

1770
01:21:03,319 --> 01:21:08,438
bunch about the the environmental impact

1771
01:21:05,868 --> 01:21:11,268
on on Turkey ins is a chemical defense

1772
01:21:08,439 --> 01:21:14,239
of the plant and I just you know the

1773
01:21:11,269 --> 01:21:16,219
expressions in which they all you know

1774
01:21:14,238 --> 01:21:17,509
each cultivar can express that you know

1775
01:21:16,219 --> 01:21:22,239
at different times during the growth

1776
01:21:17,510 --> 01:21:26,599
cycle is of extreme interest of me so

1777
01:21:22,238 --> 01:21:29,058
that that said you really need the basic

1778
01:21:26,599 --> 01:21:32,119
synthase to produce whatever Turkey

1779
01:21:29,059 --> 01:21:35,179
whether it's a simple to produce

1780
01:21:32,118 --> 01:21:40,549
labelling I said base to produce mercy

1781
01:21:35,179 --> 01:21:43,998
or it's a turkey that is a secondary

1782
01:21:40,550 --> 01:21:45,829
Turkey but it's based on the nursing

1783
01:21:43,998 --> 01:21:48,269
production of the labelling production

1784
01:21:45,828 --> 01:21:50,829
as some of the other turkeys

1785
01:21:48,270 --> 01:21:54,639
but you might know more about that the

1786
01:21:50,829 --> 01:21:57,039
me mark because I see it from a

1787
01:21:54,639 --> 01:21:59,560
practical hands-on plant point of view

1788
01:21:57,039 --> 01:22:06,189
you understand the chemistry much better

1789
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:10,500
than me well alright

1790
01:22:06,189 --> 01:22:13,029
that got deep fast speaking Greek to me

1791
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:17,649
well one more question I guess to mark

1792
01:22:13,029 --> 01:22:20,738
is so and I guess Sam too is so CB c BG

1793
01:22:17,649 --> 01:22:22,479
production is is the first from my

1794
01:22:20,738 --> 01:22:25,629
understanding the very first one that

1795
01:22:22,479 --> 01:22:29,439
that is the birther of the rest okay CBG

1796
01:22:25,630 --> 01:22:33,460
a CB GA right so and now there's extreme

1797
01:22:29,439 --> 01:22:36,549
interest in isolating this in terms of

1798
01:22:33,460 --> 01:22:38,439
breeding and expressions you know have

1799
01:22:36,550 --> 01:22:40,869
you ever truly seen a plant that doesn't

1800
01:22:38,439 --> 01:22:42,759
that doesn't just go on immediately to

1801
01:22:40,868 --> 01:22:47,589
express other to other other

1802
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:48,360
cannabinoids we bred more than a decade

1803
01:22:47,590 --> 01:22:52,000
ago

1804
01:22:48,359 --> 01:22:53,920
CBG only varieties absolutely okay

1805
01:22:52,000 --> 01:23:00,488
because that's you know I I hadn't very

1806
01:22:53,920 --> 01:23:03,219
little but cool what's that Sam that you

1807
01:23:00,488 --> 01:23:09,029
can think of we've already bred

1808
01:23:03,219 --> 01:23:14,649
varieties that Express I believe it we

1809
01:23:09,029 --> 01:23:20,408
know we started by plant breeding not by

1810
01:23:14,649 --> 01:23:22,269
engineering what's that mark I said by

1811
01:23:20,408 --> 01:23:26,379
plant breeding by traditional plant

1812
01:23:22,270 --> 01:23:29,679
breeding techniques not by not correct

1813
01:23:26,380 --> 01:23:32,170
not by genetic engineering word again

1814
01:23:29,679 --> 01:23:34,270
which modify the genome and you know the

1815
01:23:32,170 --> 01:23:36,279
gene that codes for a certain synthase

1816
01:23:34,270 --> 01:23:38,860
you could basically knock knock that out

1817
01:23:36,279 --> 01:23:47,019
and then express it again it's

1818
01:23:38,859 --> 01:23:50,549
engineered yep yeah and I guess that's a

1819
01:23:47,020 --> 01:23:54,310
whole that's a whole other commentator

1820
01:23:50,550 --> 01:23:55,750
guy I I'm a classical plant breeder and

1821
01:23:54,310 --> 01:24:00,470
so they've always been that's where

1822
01:23:55,750 --> 01:24:04,279
always be respect to that it's

1823
01:24:00,470 --> 01:24:06,650
seems to work right Sam yeah well people

1824
01:24:04,279 --> 01:24:08,960
talk about you know producing an average

1825
01:24:06,649 --> 01:24:10,819
of yeast and all this kind of [ __ ] I

1826
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:13,430
said what are you talking about you

1827
01:24:10,819 --> 01:24:18,590
[ __ ] plant the khilji two kilos of

1828
01:24:13,430 --> 01:24:22,340
towers it's 25% target and you're gonna

1829
01:24:18,590 --> 01:24:24,619
try to do it cheaper in a laboratory

1830
01:24:22,340 --> 01:24:26,960
good luck yeah and I heard they were

1831
01:24:24,619 --> 01:24:29,539
trying to grow grow terpenes as well and

1832
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:34,989
it just doesn't make much sense and but

1833
01:24:29,539 --> 01:24:37,699
uh three days I held B purse full of

1834
01:24:34,989 --> 01:24:42,260
yeast that Express CBD or

1835
01:24:37,699 --> 01:24:47,269
THC or both or terpenes it could be done

1836
01:24:42,260 --> 01:24:52,539
but is it cheaper no hmm it's it's

1837
01:24:47,270 --> 01:24:57,470
cheaper on the point of scaling up huge

1838
01:24:52,539 --> 01:25:01,640
vats to basically brew cannabinoids like

1839
01:24:57,470 --> 01:25:05,090
we brew beer well I'm not so sure it's

1840
01:25:01,640 --> 01:25:09,079
cheaper growing hemp a magic growing

1841
01:25:05,090 --> 01:25:12,980
hemp out cheaper right yeah and back

1842
01:25:09,079 --> 01:25:17,989
with a THC per idea or a CBG Bragg it's

1843
01:25:12,979 --> 01:25:19,549
pretty darn cheap mark yeah all I know

1844
01:25:17,989 --> 01:25:20,929
is that you know a lot of things are

1845
01:25:19,550 --> 01:25:23,720
made in this world by fermentation

1846
01:25:20,930 --> 01:25:26,150
citric acid is a perfect example of the

1847
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:27,409
product that's made on multi-ton scale

1848
01:25:26,149 --> 01:25:30,259
by fermentation

1849
01:25:27,409 --> 01:25:33,859
you know fermentation is just it's a way

1850
01:25:30,260 --> 01:25:35,989
of using things like yeast and microbes

1851
01:25:33,859 --> 01:25:38,059
to basically carry out chemistry it's

1852
01:25:35,989 --> 01:25:40,340
just basically biochemistry as opposed

1853
01:25:38,060 --> 01:25:42,950
to traditional chemistry where you add

1854
01:25:40,340 --> 01:25:44,989
chemicals to get things to happen so I

1855
01:25:42,949 --> 01:25:47,779
just think it's a great advance that

1856
01:25:44,989 --> 01:25:50,899
they've actually done you know the

1857
01:25:47,779 --> 01:25:52,880
cannabinoid pathway expression in yeast

1858
01:25:50,899 --> 01:25:56,599
just a great scientific achievement

1859
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:59,539
ultimately if that does produce and they

1860
01:25:56,600 --> 01:26:02,360
could basically now just have five story

1861
01:25:59,539 --> 01:26:05,359
huge stainless steel vats of yeast that

1862
01:26:02,359 --> 01:26:08,359
are cooking away and and and and making

1863
01:26:05,359 --> 01:26:11,599
cannabinoids you know at the end of the

1864
01:26:08,359 --> 01:26:14,269
day can that be made less expensive than

1865
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:17,530
the traditional growing extract

1866
01:26:14,270 --> 01:26:20,540
in processing if you're getting one

1867
01:26:17,529 --> 01:26:22,009
cannabinoid from the east pathway as

1868
01:26:20,539 --> 01:26:23,810
opposed to several different

1869
01:26:22,010 --> 01:26:26,720
cannabinoids you would get in a cannabis

1870
01:26:23,810 --> 01:26:34,370
extract it could actually be more

1871
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:37,909
economical so you know I don't believe

1872
01:26:34,369 --> 01:26:40,519
it I I work with a couple terpene

1873
01:26:37,909 --> 01:26:43,489
companies and I work with a bunch of

1874
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:45,950
terpene companies but a couple of them

1875
01:26:43,489 --> 01:26:47,869
ours are strictly non cannabis based

1876
01:26:45,949 --> 01:26:49,639
they're big chirping company that won't

1877
01:26:47,869 --> 01:26:52,819
mention their names but they're uh

1878
01:26:49,640 --> 01:26:55,220
they're they're fully non cannabis based

1879
01:26:52,819 --> 01:26:57,619
I just found that out at MJ biz when I

1880
01:26:55,220 --> 01:26:59,510
was there a couple few weeks ago I was

1881
01:26:57,619 --> 01:27:03,859
talking to some going around talking to

1882
01:26:59,510 --> 01:27:06,320
some preferred clients by Israel they're

1883
01:27:03,859 --> 01:27:09,759
not not that not this not this to that I

1884
01:27:06,319 --> 01:27:11,960
was particularly I was speaking with

1885
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:14,500
they might get their [ __ ] from me I

1886
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:17,720
don't know how they make it well

1887
01:27:14,500 --> 01:27:21,920
companies at the MJ Pez con what does

1888
01:27:17,720 --> 01:27:24,320
that tell you they're non cannabis

1889
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:27,020
terpene companies at the MJ piss con

1890
01:27:24,319 --> 01:27:30,219
they'll they'll link nicely with the non

1891
01:27:27,020 --> 01:27:33,530
cannabis yeast growing CBD and THC

1892
01:27:30,220 --> 01:27:35,840
companies that can be the future of the

1893
01:27:33,529 --> 01:27:39,050
industry just a bunch of [ __ ] growing on

1894
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:41,510
yeast and some [ __ ] swag fruit with

1895
01:27:39,050 --> 01:27:46,970
Marquess what we need to come up with is

1896
01:27:41,510 --> 01:27:48,770
the non MJ biz con on for all the people

1897
01:27:46,970 --> 01:27:50,720
who aren't in the cannabis industry and

1898
01:27:48,770 --> 01:27:56,120
those [ __ ] can go to Vegas and lose

1899
01:27:50,720 --> 01:27:57,829
their money one weekend so there's a lot

1900
01:27:56,119 --> 01:27:59,989
of phytochemicals that we just don't

1901
01:27:57,829 --> 01:28:03,109
know about am i you know i just i think

1902
01:27:59,989 --> 01:28:04,760
that we weave those types of thing again

1903
01:28:03,109 --> 01:28:07,309
it just clouds everything when we have

1904
01:28:04,760 --> 01:28:08,720
those guys coming into the to these b2b

1905
01:28:07,310 --> 01:28:11,990
things because people like you're saying

1906
01:28:08,720 --> 01:28:13,789
the non cannabis people gets wound by

1907
01:28:11,989 --> 01:28:16,359
the non cannabis people we shall we

1908
01:28:13,789 --> 01:28:26,420
shall call them yeast we call them yeast

1909
01:28:16,359 --> 01:28:28,359
they grow like a fungus I was not that I

1910
01:28:26,420 --> 01:28:33,250
saw

1911
01:28:28,359 --> 01:28:36,619
cannabis being expressed in yeast was

1912
01:28:33,250 --> 01:28:39,710
actually was in - back over it about

1913
01:28:36,619 --> 01:28:43,359
20-25 years ago by some work done by

1914
01:28:39,710 --> 01:28:46,670
sherry Amma a Japanese scientist and

1915
01:28:43,359 --> 01:28:50,539
yeah the right was on the wall that

1916
01:28:46,670 --> 01:29:00,409
people were going to do this but all

1917
01:28:50,539 --> 01:29:03,289
cigarettes fresene THC but actually you

1918
01:29:00,409 --> 01:29:04,369
don't need part of lemonade he had to

1919
01:29:03,289 --> 01:29:09,159
feed at CVG

1920
01:29:04,369 --> 01:29:11,899
I don't even the yeast groups that are

1921
01:29:09,159 --> 01:29:16,819
growing synthetic cannabinoids need to

1922
01:29:11,899 --> 01:29:20,149
also feed CBG a know you can go see it

1923
01:29:16,819 --> 01:29:25,429
now in the whole chick then it will

1924
01:29:20,149 --> 01:29:33,500
first produce CBG from CVG whatever you

1925
01:29:25,430 --> 01:29:35,780
want GT or CD or whatever you want it's

1926
01:29:33,500 --> 01:29:38,510
fully engineered Marc so they engineered

1927
01:29:35,779 --> 01:29:41,300
the pathway right into the to the

1928
01:29:38,510 --> 01:29:43,550
modified yeast so oxygen technically

1929
01:29:41,300 --> 01:29:46,220
modified yeast that's doing it including

1930
01:29:43,550 --> 01:29:50,650
turkeys you can express the terpene

1931
01:29:46,220 --> 01:29:53,420
yield and expression and profile with

1932
01:29:50,649 --> 01:30:00,679
and will it just be like dank yeast

1933
01:29:53,420 --> 01:30:03,470
leads be like this is incredible my god

1934
01:30:00,680 --> 01:30:07,450
[ __ ] just the loudest it's like what's

1935
01:30:03,470 --> 01:30:07,449
on your pocket just some yeast bro I

1936
01:30:08,079 --> 01:30:13,489
could smell the weed on you

1937
01:30:11,859 --> 01:30:21,159
it's my yeast

1938
01:30:13,489 --> 01:30:23,869
it's my yeast like sauerkraut infection

1939
01:30:21,159 --> 01:30:29,840
so that's kind of that's yeah that's

1940
01:30:23,869 --> 01:30:31,970
crazy that's crazy so that it's truly

1941
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:34,069
the the you you would say Sam that it's

1942
01:30:31,970 --> 01:30:37,490
truly the same expression you that you

1943
01:30:34,069 --> 01:30:41,509
know cuz nature's chemist is is one one

1944
01:30:37,489 --> 01:30:43,130
mysterious chemist you know

1945
01:30:41,510 --> 01:30:46,310
the way that it all comes together off

1946
01:30:43,130 --> 01:30:49,760
the plant so I listen you can't possibly

1947
01:30:46,310 --> 01:30:51,469
think if you believe that there are a

1948
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:53,840
bunch of things that we maybe have not

1949
01:30:51,469 --> 01:30:58,359
discovered about this plant yet or if

1950
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:58,360
there's you know new phytochemicals

1951
01:30:58,899 --> 01:31:03,198
right there's a lot of different things

1952
01:31:01,010 --> 01:31:05,480
going on that we might not be perceiving

1953
01:31:03,198 --> 01:31:09,409
is all I wouldn't be surprised if they

1954
01:31:05,479 --> 01:31:12,678
found a whole new class of molecules or

1955
01:31:09,409 --> 01:31:14,929
whatever it's it's it's hard to say but

1956
01:31:12,679 --> 01:31:17,029
how do I know that just produce on THC

1957
01:31:14,929 --> 01:31:19,880
and terpenes on yeast is gonna yield the

1958
01:31:17,029 --> 01:31:22,219
same sort of entourage effect of you

1959
01:31:19,880 --> 01:31:28,090
know a flower that's been growing for

1960
01:31:22,219 --> 01:31:31,069
the other one they won't I think it will

1961
01:31:28,090 --> 01:31:33,350
but they must think that it will they

1962
01:31:31,069 --> 01:31:35,299
must think like we'll get close well I

1963
01:31:33,350 --> 01:31:36,980
think it's part of it is the single

1964
01:31:35,300 --> 01:31:39,140
active ingredient mantra of the

1965
01:31:36,979 --> 01:31:41,029
pharmaceutical industry that every

1966
01:31:39,140 --> 01:31:42,890
medicine just has a single active

1967
01:31:41,029 --> 01:31:44,809
ingredient not multiple active

1968
01:31:42,890 --> 01:31:46,850
ingredients and so there's a cannabis

1969
01:31:44,810 --> 01:31:49,730
plant teaches us anything it teaches us

1970
01:31:46,850 --> 01:31:52,850
that the biological action on humans

1971
01:31:49,729 --> 01:31:54,678
when we consume cannabis isn't just see

1972
01:31:52,850 --> 01:31:57,050
alone it's all these other things that

1973
01:31:54,679 --> 01:31:58,579
are in there and you know we've talked

1974
01:31:57,050 --> 01:32:02,000
about this quite a bit on hash church

1975
01:31:58,579 --> 01:32:04,250
about terpenes that modulate the

1976
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:08,529
cannabinoids I think it would be really

1977
01:32:04,250 --> 01:32:11,659
interesting to a cannabinoids

1978
01:32:08,529 --> 01:32:13,609
reformulate them with a natural terpene

1979
01:32:11,659 --> 01:32:16,448
profile that you'd find in flower and

1980
01:32:13,609 --> 01:32:19,698
then compare the Tipsy could actually

1981
01:32:16,448 --> 01:32:22,969
recreate that experience that you get

1982
01:32:19,698 --> 01:32:25,339
from flower figured out I mean that's a

1983
01:32:22,969 --> 01:32:28,130
that's a though be amazing to see that

1984
01:32:25,340 --> 01:32:30,770
that that study done I think long-term

1985
01:32:28,130 --> 01:32:32,329
that would be something we should

1986
01:32:30,770 --> 01:32:33,679
explore I mean someone should explore

1987
01:32:32,329 --> 01:32:35,329
that because it's it's important to know

1988
01:32:33,679 --> 01:32:37,190
you know it's the one thing every time I

1989
01:32:35,329 --> 01:32:39,769
talk to these guys that are really into

1990
01:32:37,189 --> 01:32:41,719
into the natural diverged catcher pains

1991
01:32:39,770 --> 01:32:43,640
they always tell me yeah but you don't

1992
01:32:41,719 --> 01:32:46,219
know what's in your in that extract

1993
01:32:43,640 --> 01:32:48,469
that's coming from the plant and it just

1994
01:32:46,219 --> 01:32:50,179
really confuses me because I I really

1995
01:32:48,469 --> 01:32:54,289
look at the natural terpenes there's a

1996
01:32:50,179 --> 01:32:55,069
very narrow scope and expression off the

1997
01:32:54,289 --> 01:32:58,519
plant a very

1998
01:32:55,069 --> 01:33:00,170
and three-dimensional scope so it's it's

1999
01:32:58,520 --> 01:33:01,880
confusing to me when I when I hear

2000
01:33:00,170 --> 01:33:07,340
people that have extreme knowledge and

2001
01:33:01,880 --> 01:33:10,010
PhDs with you know speak on that I will

2002
01:33:07,340 --> 01:33:11,930
just mention that I think raka is gonna

2003
01:33:10,010 --> 01:33:13,430
come in here and in a minute or two so

2004
01:33:11,930 --> 01:33:16,880
we can kind of maybe bring the

2005
01:33:13,430 --> 01:33:19,280
conversation back to music in cannabis

2006
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:21,850
welcome him he's trying to figure out

2007
01:33:19,279 --> 01:33:23,989
how to get in just with this audio so

2008
01:33:21,850 --> 01:33:26,030
I've been heard from mugs yet I just

2009
01:33:23,989 --> 01:33:29,689
texted him hadn't heard back so it's

2010
01:33:26,029 --> 01:33:31,340
early man I know it's early and plus you

2011
01:33:29,689 --> 01:33:33,019
know what I know from inviting a lot of

2012
01:33:31,340 --> 01:33:35,690
people on to hash Church over the years

2013
01:33:33,020 --> 01:33:38,360
that there's always just people who a

2014
01:33:35,689 --> 01:33:40,279
either show up really late or be just

2015
01:33:38,359 --> 01:33:42,170
can't make it dude it's [ __ ] Sunday

2016
01:33:40,279 --> 01:33:44,389
morning Sunday morning

2017
01:33:42,170 --> 01:33:47,569
so come on dude nine o'clock you got to

2018
01:33:44,390 --> 01:33:51,770
be there hash Church like I'm an artist

2019
01:33:47,569 --> 01:33:54,889
I got a seven-hour ride in front of me

2020
01:33:51,770 --> 01:33:59,510
so I'm gonna pop off live in hours yes

2021
01:33:54,890 --> 01:34:03,800
yes where the heck of you headin in

2022
01:33:59,510 --> 01:34:06,829
Vermont and driving back to home you're

2023
01:34:03,800 --> 01:34:09,470
in Vermont where you want to show the

2024
01:34:06,829 --> 01:34:14,680
other day the CP operation up here you

2025
01:34:09,470 --> 01:34:18,590
know Vermont is legalized too and we are

2026
01:34:14,680 --> 01:34:21,110
putting in a processing center in what's

2027
01:34:18,590 --> 01:34:22,730
called Northeast Kingdom of Vermont

2028
01:34:21,109 --> 01:34:24,799
which is her like the northeast area of

2029
01:34:22,729 --> 01:34:27,919
Vermont we really like about 40 or 50

2030
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:31,520
miles from Canada I know where that is

2031
01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:34,850
I know that area really well I I grew up

2032
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:36,620
in that area yeah there's a lot of folks

2033
01:34:34,850 --> 01:34:40,220
up here who are growing half and not a

2034
01:34:36,619 --> 01:34:43,220
whole lot of places to process it so you

2035
01:34:40,220 --> 01:34:45,619
know Vermont's famous for its maple

2036
01:34:43,220 --> 01:34:47,480
syrup you know all the sugar shacks and

2037
01:34:45,619 --> 01:34:50,029
the woods and you just see a bunch of

2038
01:34:47,479 --> 01:34:51,109
trees and the sugar shack with the smoke

2039
01:34:50,029 --> 01:34:53,210
going up and you know that they're

2040
01:34:51,109 --> 01:34:55,659
making they're making sugar there and

2041
01:34:53,210 --> 01:34:58,430
the savory sack right over the border

2042
01:34:55,659 --> 01:35:00,470
yes so I think what we're gonna see is

2043
01:34:58,430 --> 01:35:01,719
those operations start to be displaced

2044
01:35:00,470 --> 01:35:04,210
by

2045
01:35:01,719 --> 01:35:06,189
I have the traction operations you know

2046
01:35:04,210 --> 01:35:07,590
they're still gonna be collecting syrup

2047
01:35:06,189 --> 01:35:13,719
it's just gonna be a different type

2048
01:35:07,590 --> 01:35:15,670
Sarah Sarah nice yeah

2049
01:35:13,719 --> 01:35:18,460
well [ __ ] well have a good safe travels

2050
01:35:15,670 --> 01:35:22,000
mark well yeah thanks Marcus great show

2051
01:35:18,460 --> 01:35:24,359
today got 600 people watchong thought

2052
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:28,779
you might like it

2053
01:35:24,359 --> 01:35:34,420
you think I sub CB isolate we'll end up

2054
01:35:28,779 --> 01:35:40,238
following - no that's a good question I

2055
01:35:34,420 --> 01:35:47,560
mean right now spot market prices are

2056
01:35:40,238 --> 01:35:54,159
somewhere between 52 to 6500 per kilo

2057
01:35:47,560 --> 01:35:58,300
you know so that's six and a half cents

2058
01:35:54,159 --> 01:36:01,119
think of it this way like if I if I if I

2059
01:35:58,300 --> 01:36:03,789
buy CBD isolate for six dollars a gram

2060
01:36:01,119 --> 01:36:06,340
three dollars of that gram probably goes

2061
01:36:03,789 --> 01:36:09,698
to the farmer maybe another two dollars

2062
01:36:06,340 --> 01:36:12,310
goes to the processor and then maybe one

2063
01:36:09,698 --> 01:36:15,488
dollar to the guy who's sort of middle

2064
01:36:12,310 --> 01:36:19,300
Manning the operation to get the isolate

2065
01:36:15,488 --> 01:36:21,759
to the market so I'm not sure that it

2066
01:36:19,300 --> 01:36:24,400
could i I I don't know Sam I really

2067
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:26,560
don't know I mean right now I think

2068
01:36:24,399 --> 01:36:30,429
they're kind of like I what I was saying

2069
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:32,890
before about Oregon is that because CBD

2070
01:36:30,430 --> 01:36:36,310
has a much larger addressable market

2071
01:36:32,890 --> 01:36:38,500
with more value to growing CBD than THC

2072
01:36:36,310 --> 01:36:46,030
I never thought that would be the case

2073
01:36:38,500 --> 01:36:48,279
never even a gas stations in the middle

2074
01:36:46,029 --> 01:36:51,069
of the country that have no zero

2075
01:36:48,279 --> 01:36:52,500
cannabis laws THC is illegal you get

2076
01:36:51,069 --> 01:36:55,509
pulled over and thrown in jail forever

2077
01:36:52,500 --> 01:36:56,680
you go to the gas station behind the

2078
01:36:55,510 --> 01:36:58,930
freakin counter

2079
01:36:56,680 --> 01:37:01,210
there's gummies there's vape pens

2080
01:36:58,930 --> 01:37:06,520
there's this there's that sold at gas

2081
01:37:01,210 --> 01:37:09,698
stations you know all over Europe - so

2082
01:37:06,520 --> 01:37:11,710
that's what yeah that's what is really

2083
01:37:09,698 --> 01:37:15,279
interesting is all over Europe now the

2084
01:37:11,710 --> 01:37:15,550
CBD is everywhere kind of Switzerland is

2085
01:37:15,279 --> 01:37:18,670
where

2086
01:37:15,550 --> 01:37:20,619
really popping off and now you can just

2087
01:37:18,670 --> 01:37:22,810
go to the bodega in Switzerland it's

2088
01:37:20,619 --> 01:37:25,449
totally unregulated and they sell most

2089
01:37:22,810 --> 01:37:27,490
of it just in in in the raw product of

2090
01:37:25,449 --> 01:37:28,539
the herb and they use it just to put it

2091
01:37:27,489 --> 01:37:30,760
in there too they mix with tobacco

2092
01:37:28,539 --> 01:37:33,609
anyway and they don't like to get it

2093
01:37:30,760 --> 01:37:36,760
stoned in Europe anyway so it's becoming

2094
01:37:33,609 --> 01:37:41,289
a really big phenomena the CBD a little

2095
01:37:36,760 --> 01:37:45,610
bit of history the CBD when I used to

2096
01:37:41,289 --> 01:37:50,069
buy it more than 10 years ago with ten

2097
01:37:45,609 --> 01:37:55,089
$100 a gram maybe even 300 or one gram

2098
01:37:50,069 --> 01:37:56,829
now mark seen it six dollars oh well

2099
01:37:55,090 --> 01:38:00,010
somewhere between and I mean it really

2100
01:37:56,829 --> 01:38:02,050
depends Sam it depends on two things and

2101
01:38:00,010 --> 01:38:03,579
one of the things I think that we have

2102
01:38:02,050 --> 01:38:05,380
to be concerned with is these large

2103
01:38:03,579 --> 01:38:07,960
companies that basically are probably

2104
01:38:05,380 --> 01:38:09,819
doing manufacturing over in China could

2105
01:38:07,960 --> 01:38:13,149
dump it here on the US market and

2106
01:38:09,819 --> 01:38:15,069
basically I put the the the US farmers

2107
01:38:13,149 --> 01:38:17,469
out of business because there's no way

2108
01:38:15,069 --> 01:38:19,659
that those people can compete with

2109
01:38:17,470 --> 01:38:21,900
people like Jen Khanna who probably had

2110
01:38:19,659 --> 01:38:25,300
a multi-billion dollar billion ton

2111
01:38:21,899 --> 01:38:27,639
contracts with labs over in China again

2112
01:38:25,300 --> 01:38:30,730
we talked about $3 going to the farmer

2113
01:38:27,640 --> 01:38:33,430
and $3 maybe $2 going to the processor

2114
01:38:30,729 --> 01:38:36,459
$1 going to the to the supply chain guy

2115
01:38:33,430 --> 01:38:39,670
well over in China those numbers become

2116
01:38:36,460 --> 01:38:43,359
$1 1.1 you know what I mean so there's

2117
01:38:39,670 --> 01:38:45,970
no way if China starts dumping CBD on

2118
01:38:43,359 --> 01:38:47,739
the open market here that these

2119
01:38:45,970 --> 01:38:49,329
companies are gonna be able to survive

2120
01:38:47,739 --> 01:38:52,179
so I think there needs to be two things

2121
01:38:49,329 --> 01:38:55,359
there has to be sort of the way that we

2122
01:38:52,180 --> 01:38:57,220
have farm-to-table traceability and and

2123
01:38:55,359 --> 01:38:59,619
the value that's associated with that

2124
01:38:57,220 --> 01:39:02,050
so when you sit down at a restaurant and

2125
01:38:59,619 --> 01:39:05,260
you eat that dinner and you know that

2126
01:39:02,050 --> 01:39:08,409
the food and the produce is coming from

2127
01:39:05,260 --> 01:39:15,010
local farms and so that way the consumer

2128
01:39:08,409 --> 01:39:18,489
is in that agricultural supply chain in

2129
01:39:15,010 --> 01:39:22,960
America a small small small percentage

2130
01:39:18,489 --> 01:39:24,789
of the farmers I know everybody more

2131
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:26,770
popular I think it's a more loving more

2132
01:39:24,789 --> 01:39:27,909
per gallon it's a collective

2133
01:39:26,770 --> 01:39:30,310
consciousness

2134
01:39:27,909 --> 01:39:31,899
yes it's a collective consciousness now

2135
01:39:30,310 --> 01:39:33,160
that is happening everybody wants to

2136
01:39:31,899 --> 01:39:36,269
know what's but they're being put in

2137
01:39:33,159 --> 01:39:38,889
their body that's why I think a no-till

2138
01:39:36,270 --> 01:39:41,200
from from seed to sale like you're

2139
01:39:38,890 --> 01:39:44,050
saying and even you know using cover

2140
01:39:41,199 --> 01:39:45,939
crop and rejecting the soil is with with

2141
01:39:44,050 --> 01:39:48,070
the right type of nutrients and not use

2142
01:39:45,939 --> 01:39:50,769
you know rotating fields and doing all

2143
01:39:48,069 --> 01:39:54,189
these same things that we use in Ag and

2144
01:39:50,770 --> 01:39:55,900
we bring it to the general public as our

2145
01:39:54,189 --> 01:39:59,139
crop that is actually worth something

2146
01:39:55,899 --> 01:40:01,089
now to a farmer and we teach them

2147
01:39:59,140 --> 01:40:03,850
everything about you know what it means

2148
01:40:01,090 --> 01:40:05,470
to plant and what it means to to you

2149
01:40:03,850 --> 01:40:08,020
know look at certain cultivars and why

2150
01:40:05,470 --> 01:40:09,369
you need to you know we're I you know I

2151
01:40:08,020 --> 01:40:13,800
think we're at the Renaissance of

2152
01:40:09,369 --> 01:40:13,800
looking at regional genetics where we're

2153
01:40:14,850 --> 01:40:18,410
[Laughter]

2154
01:40:20,850 --> 01:40:25,660
good thing we got bubbleman on our side

2155
01:40:24,039 --> 01:40:30,550
yeah so where do you think it goes from

2156
01:40:25,659 --> 01:40:32,979
here Sam I I think she became all the

2157
01:40:30,550 --> 01:40:34,570
small producers and the people can't do

2158
01:40:32,979 --> 01:40:36,879
it efficiently or gonna go belly-up

2159
01:40:34,569 --> 01:40:38,679
obviously right yep

2160
01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:42,520
I mean look what's happening in Oregon

2161
01:40:38,680 --> 01:40:44,800
already bison both recreational and

2162
01:40:42,520 --> 01:40:49,240
medical but the prices have fallen

2163
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:52,000
through the floor yeah I wanted to

2164
01:40:49,239 --> 01:40:55,329
welcome raka into the room I see that

2165
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:57,729
you just made it in dude super low-tech

2166
01:40:55,329 --> 01:40:59,409
I had to go do myself a crash course on

2167
01:40:57,729 --> 01:41:01,089
this before I could get on here you know

2168
01:40:59,409 --> 01:41:03,159
what it's not not a problem at all you

2169
01:41:01,090 --> 01:41:04,690
did pretty good I have to say I'm here I

2170
01:41:03,159 --> 01:41:06,639
guess I guess we connected the dots are

2171
01:41:04,689 --> 01:41:08,349
you doing exactly doing really good man

2172
01:41:06,640 --> 01:41:11,829
we've been just sort of shooting the

2173
01:41:08,350 --> 01:41:13,600
[ __ ] telling some stories Morgan mojo

2174
01:41:11,829 --> 01:41:17,079

deep questions they're calling for a

2179
01:41:22,449 --> 01:41:29,470
little bit about breathing and Jesus I

2180
01:41:25,779 --> 01:41:31,809

2185
01:41:38,109 --> 01:41:41,729
solo tour for the past solo campaign for

2186
01:41:40,810 --> 01:41:43,930
the past year or so

2187
01:41:41,729 --> 01:41:46,889

01:41:46,890 --> 01:41:52,000
Vancouver when he was here recently and

2190
01:41:49,719 --> 01:41:56,020

no chill chill chill yeah yeah chill

2196
01:42:06,729 --> 01:42:10,299
like choo I think it's choom gang like

2197
01:42:08,319 --> 01:42:11,710
Barack Obama's old crew back in Hawaii I

2198
01:42:10,300 --> 01:42:14,949
think he was the choom gang I think it

2199
01:42:11,710 --> 01:42:16,300
was for play on that exactly been doing

2200
01:42:14,949 --> 01:42:18,639
a lot like I said evidence has been uh

2201
01:42:16,300 --> 01:42:19,779
just working on his solo campaign and it

2202
01:42:18,640 --> 01:42:21,820
was something that's been planned for a

2203
01:42:19,779 --> 01:42:24,369
while we knew it was gonna happen so at

2204
01:42:21,819 --> 01:42:27,670
the same time my DJ bamboo he opened a

2205
01:42:24,369 --> 01:42:29,199
school with his crew the B junkie

2206
01:42:27,670 --> 01:42:32,619
Institute of sound and it's just like a

2207
01:42:29,199 --> 01:42:34,960
full DJ curriculum for a lot of youth

2208
01:42:32,619 --> 01:42:36,789
stuff but um yeah they're they're sendin

2209
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:38,770
champions out of that school too so it's

2210
01:42:36,789 --> 01:42:42,039
like a real serious DJ's that's cool

2211
01:42:38,770 --> 01:42:44,980
rocker it's in I believe technically is

2212
01:42:42,039 --> 01:42:46,180
in Glendale California mistaken isn't

2213
01:42:44,979 --> 01:42:47,709
it's in Southern California I think that

2214
01:42:46,180 --> 01:42:49,600
technically is in Glendale though I've

2215
01:42:47,710 --> 01:42:51,880
seen some video footage from it I was

2216
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:52,840
like that's really cool yeah it is

2217
01:42:51,880 --> 01:42:54,430
really cool they set up a lot of

2218
01:42:52,840 --> 01:42:57,010
turntables and what's what's also really

2219
01:42:54,430 --> 01:42:58,539
cool I mean I mean it's LA so you know

2220
01:42:57,010 --> 01:42:59,860
it's easy to find money for people that

2221
01:42:58,539 --> 01:43:01,659
want to just throw throw money it's

2222
01:42:59,859 --> 01:43:03,339
something to become a DJ but to actually

2223
01:43:01,659 --> 01:43:06,039
take the time to teach really strong

2224
01:43:03,340 --> 01:43:08,050
fundamentals to the kids and not just be

2225
01:43:06,039 --> 01:43:09,488
push-button but to actually understand

2226
01:43:08,050 --> 01:43:10,810
and appreciate the music that you're

2227
01:43:09,488 --> 01:43:12,789
spinning and to listen to the music

2228
01:43:10,810 --> 01:43:14,800
rather than just trying to match beats

2229
01:43:12,789 --> 01:43:16,180
to keep the party live it's a really

2230
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:18,159
strong way that they're doing it I like

2231
01:43:16,180 --> 01:43:19,900
it over there that's great to hear man

2232
01:43:18,159 --> 01:43:21,689
they had a couple of six schools like

2233
01:43:19,899 --> 01:43:24,729
that in New York City for a while man

2234
01:43:21,689 --> 01:43:26,379
yeah the the DJ a marriage is a friend

2235
01:43:24,729 --> 01:43:29,799
of mine he ran one for a little while

2236
01:43:26,380 --> 01:43:31,600
here out here and it that's that's

2237
01:43:29,800 --> 01:43:34,210
that's how you do it man inspire the

2238
01:43:31,600 --> 01:43:35,650
young absolutely I mean otherwise you

2239
01:43:34,210 --> 01:43:37,510
really don't have a if you have an

2240
01:43:35,649 --> 01:43:39,609
opportunity to inspire the youth who are

2241
01:43:37,510 --> 01:43:41,680
gonna be the future and you don't then

2242
01:43:39,609 --> 01:43:43,269
you really don't have much of a much

2243
01:43:41,680 --> 01:43:44,560
place to really complain about what

2244
01:43:43,270 --> 01:43:47,110
happens in the future when you've had it

2245
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:48,969
you had an opportunity to to to help

2246
01:43:47,109 --> 01:43:50,889
shape that you have been you know

2247
01:43:48,969 --> 01:43:52,480
contribute to that what are the when you

2248
01:43:50,890 --> 01:43:53,140
get when you get with them use like how

2249
01:43:52,479 --> 01:43:55,689
young

2250
01:43:53,140 --> 01:43:57,280
are they are they like Luca Luca use are

2251
01:43:55,689 --> 01:43:58,960
they like yeah there's some of them

2252
01:43:57,279 --> 01:44:03,039
better I think that I believe if I'm not

2253
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:04,630
mistaken you have to be is it seven or

2254
01:44:03,039 --> 01:44:07,569
eight there's a cut-off where they feel

2255
01:44:04,630 --> 01:44:08,829
like if they have like like open open

2256
01:44:07,569 --> 01:44:10,449
turntable days where you know if you

2257
01:44:08,829 --> 01:44:12,010
people come in and bring their kids or

2258
01:44:10,449 --> 01:44:13,389
little brothers and sisters babies or

2259
01:44:12,010 --> 01:44:15,699
even down there and they'll let them

2260
01:44:13,390 --> 01:44:17,800
play around but as far as it's a

2261
01:44:15,699 --> 01:44:19,779
classroom setting I believe it might be

2262
01:44:17,800 --> 01:44:21,279
eight years old I'll double-check with

2263
01:44:19,779 --> 01:44:22,689
Babu but it's they start really young

2264
01:44:21,279 --> 01:44:25,300
they have like different levels of

2265
01:44:22,689 --> 01:44:27,609
classes very young all kids classes they

2266
01:44:25,300 --> 01:44:29,829
do like workshop camps all the way up to

2267
01:44:27,609 --> 01:44:31,329
full adult classes and even private

2268
01:44:29,829 --> 01:44:33,399
one-on-one sessions with DJ's that

2269
01:44:31,329 --> 01:44:36,039
really want to sharpen their turntable

2270
01:44:33,399 --> 01:44:38,109
of skills or or people that don't really

2271
01:44:36,039 --> 01:44:39,789
have the time or the space or the

2272
01:44:38,109 --> 01:44:41,949
equipment even or don't feel comfortable

2273
01:44:39,789 --> 01:44:43,930
kind of working their way up in the

2274
01:44:41,949 --> 01:44:45,279
actual clubs they'll go there and kind

2275
01:44:43,930 --> 01:44:46,840
of give their skills to a level where

2276
01:44:45,279 --> 01:44:48,579
they feel that they can debut them and

2277
01:44:46,840 --> 01:44:50,409
then and then jump in that way so they

2278
01:44:48,579 --> 01:44:53,409
they teach the full spectrum all the way

2279
01:44:50,409 --> 01:44:55,149
from very young I would say probably say

2280
01:44:53,409 --> 01:44:56,439
second grade or something like third

2281
01:44:55,149 --> 01:44:57,849
grade I think they have some kids that

2282
01:44:56,439 --> 01:45:02,109
are really young all the way to

2283
01:44:57,850 --> 01:45:05,560
professional adults that's really cool

2284
01:45:02,109 --> 01:45:08,649

2550
01:55:16,390 --> 01:55:20,079
really built a lot of bridges rather

2551

2559
01:55:35,800 --> 01:55:40,840
different be real than you would have

2560
01:55:37,359 --> 01:55:42,309
known as as mister freeze or Louie back

2561
01:55:40,840 --> 01:55:43,569
in the days with some pop out from under

2562
01:55:42,310 --> 01:55:45,190
the seat of the Cadillac like it's a

2563
01:55:43,569 --> 01:55:46,479
totally different totally different day

but he's still you know he's still a

2565
01:55:46,479 --> 01:55:49,419
real when he still has that if you want

2566
01:55:48,279 --> 01:55:52,179
to bring it but he's just channeling

2567
01:55:49,420 --> 01:55:54,430
that toward more attacking the things

2568
01:55:52,180 --> 01:55:55,690
that he feels or defending against the

2569
01:55:54,430 --> 01:55:57,490
things that he feels are appropriate

2570
01:55:55,689 --> 01:55:59,439
rather than just being uh exactly he was

2571
01:55:57,489 --> 01:56:01,630
it was special that way he always had

2572

01:56:05,109 --> 01:56:10,929
pretty much everything and he always

2575
01:56:09,369 --> 01:56:12,970
brought it no matter what he was always

2576

tonnage dilated beat junkies we brought

2718
02:01:23,930 --> 02:01:27,200
out I went to all those parties dude and

2719
02:01:25,819 --> 02:01:30,799
that but that first one wasn't at the

2720
02:01:27,199 --> 02:01:33,519
milk bag no the first one was not at the

2721
02:01:30,800 --> 02:01:36,940
milk bag it was a smaller club whoo

2722
02:01:33,520 --> 02:01:39,160
that's Joe someplace amazing

2723
02:01:36,939 --> 02:01:40,599
I was an amazing show dude I'm telling

2724
02:01:39,159 --> 02:01:42,939
you that was like and I've seen a ton of

2725
02:01:40,600 --> 02:01:44,140
shows but that show I think part of it

2726
02:01:42,939 --> 02:01:46,509
was that I was sitting on the couch

2727
02:01:44,140 --> 02:01:51,000
behind you in evidence while you were

2728
02:01:46,510 --> 02:01:51,000
performing on a stage with Don and Aaron

2729
02:01:54,239 --> 02:01:59,619
amazing and dogs not just leaning over

2730
02:01:57,100 --> 02:02:12,070
he's like we're so [ __ ] fine tonight

2731
02:01:59,619 --> 02:02:13,449
I remember they had a popcorn machine

2732
02:02:12,069 --> 02:02:15,699
there and his mom was like they're

2733
02:02:13,449 --> 02:02:17,829
popping like popcorn with my cannabutter

2734
02:02:15,699 --> 02:02:19,090
like that inside the venue while the

2735
02:02:17,829 --> 02:02:20,739
whole place is crazy and they're rolling

2736
02:02:19,090 --> 02:02:21,909
up and passing I remember on the stage

2737
02:02:20,739 --> 02:02:24,429
like you said the couches on the stage

2738
02:02:21,909 --> 02:02:26,139
and it was also like a different you

2739
02:02:24,430 --> 02:02:29,079
know the clubs being in those really big

2740
02:02:26,140 --> 02:02:30,640
places especially with everyone being so

2741
02:02:29,079 --> 02:02:32,949
high and everything else it's not as

2742
02:02:30,640 --> 02:02:35,440
easy to get that Ross jump around energy

2743
02:02:32,949 --> 02:02:36,970
that you had a lot of rapture ah yeah

2744
02:02:35,439 --> 02:02:38,909
that was one that was but energy was

2745
02:02:36,970 --> 02:02:41,619
bouncing off the walls there which was

2746
02:02:38,909 --> 02:02:43,210
kind of you know is not often the case

2747
02:02:41,619 --> 02:02:44,979
it like some of these parties where

2748
02:02:43,210 --> 02:02:46,300
everyone so high you get the everyone

2749
02:02:44,979 --> 02:02:48,039
watches and at the end you get the

2750
02:02:46,300 --> 02:02:50,110
applause like that was brilliant that

2751
02:02:48,039 --> 02:02:51,609
was beautiful but you know we're used to

2752
02:02:50,109 --> 02:02:53,769
like more than I guess I guess you could

2753
02:02:51,609 --> 02:02:56,259
say in our experiences more I guess the

2754
02:02:53,770 --> 02:02:57,940
drug crowds did the high crowd so it's

2755
02:02:56,260 --> 02:03:00,220
usually a lot more raw energy people

2756
02:02:57,939 --> 02:03:01,689
jumping around and flipping around but

2757
02:03:00,220 --> 02:03:02,949
uh yeah that was one of those great ones

2758
02:03:01,689 --> 02:03:05,019
where it balanced out really well and

2759
02:03:02,949 --> 02:03:06,699
that's a really good energy out of it in

2760
02:03:05,020 --> 02:03:08,560
its stead of set in motion a lot of

2761
02:03:06,699 --> 02:03:11,199
things for me to kind of actually work

2762
02:03:08,560 --> 02:03:12,970
in a different side of this business you

2763
02:03:11,199 --> 02:03:15,460
know I was I was looking a lot of shows

2764
02:03:12,970 --> 02:03:16,900
but I was also booking a lot of and

2765
02:03:15,460 --> 02:03:19,420
ended up opening a lot of doors for me

2766
02:03:16,899 --> 02:03:23,259
to do like a lot of relate I end up

2767
02:03:19,420 --> 02:03:25,149
working with weed maps and restock and

2768
02:03:23,260 --> 02:03:27,699
Marley natural and a bunch of people on

2769
02:03:25,149 --> 02:03:29,469
different events just doing about a lot

2770
02:03:27,699 --> 02:03:30,489
of different parties if there was you

2771
02:03:29,470 --> 02:03:32,230
know different conventions I was doing

2772
02:03:30,489 --> 02:03:36,489
after parties in Vegas every November

2773
02:03:32,229 --> 02:03:38,829
for for lead maps or for DNA at the was

2774
02:03:36,489 --> 02:03:40,689
at the Hard Rock when they were doing

2775
02:03:38,829 --> 02:03:42,460
the hotel parties when they would take

2776
02:03:40,689 --> 02:03:44,589
over the big the big room with a private

2777
02:03:42,460 --> 02:03:46,840
swimming pool in the in the hotel room

2778
02:03:44,590 --> 02:03:49,090
thing I think was the MTV Road rules

2779
02:03:46,840 --> 02:03:52,300
after something so I need up doing a lot

2780
02:03:49,090 --> 02:03:55,119
of events in the space that help me

2781
02:03:52,300 --> 02:03:56,500
build a lot of bridges and yeah I still

2782
02:03:55,118 --> 02:03:58,719
to this day I'm doing branding marketing

2783
02:03:56,500 --> 02:04:00,399
and stuff I have a you know I'm kind of

2784
02:03:58,719 --> 02:04:01,750
under some paperwork right now so I was

2785
02:04:00,399 --> 02:04:03,039
hoping that I was I was trying to get it

2786
02:04:01,750 --> 02:04:04,149
clear to talk about this time I'm gonna

2787
02:04:03,039 --> 02:04:05,529
have to come back to church I guess

2788
02:04:04,149 --> 02:04:08,049
pretty soon to talk about some things I

2789
02:04:05,529 --> 02:04:10,689
have going on but it kind of made you

2790
02:04:08,050 --> 02:04:12,250
know I didn't I never wanted to I've

2791
02:04:10,689 --> 02:04:14,769
died late has been offered many times

2792
02:04:12,250 --> 02:04:17,139
the opportunity to get on the the brand

2793
02:04:14,770 --> 02:04:18,610
partnership side of things like just put

2794
02:04:17,139 --> 02:04:22,420
our name and logo on something and take

2795
02:04:18,609 --> 02:04:23,920
a slice that never really didn't really

2796
02:04:22,420 --> 02:04:26,380
interest me because of the circle of

2797
02:04:23,920 --> 02:04:28,389
people that I was around I was sitting

2798
02:04:26,380 --> 02:04:30,760
you know some solid people and I had a

2799
02:04:28,389 --> 02:04:32,380
better grasp of the business than the

2800
02:04:30,760 --> 02:04:34,300
people that were simply just adding

2801
02:04:32,380 --> 02:04:36,010
their name and likeness exactly I know a

2802
02:04:34,300 --> 02:04:40,239
lot of artists that are trying to like

2803
02:04:36,010 --> 02:04:42,429
like like try to just just just have

2804
02:04:40,238 --> 02:04:44,769
someone just license their their name

2805
02:04:42,429 --> 02:04:46,690
for their brand right and I tell them

2806
02:04:44,770 --> 02:04:48,670
that's never got that almost never gonna

2807
02:04:46,689 --> 02:04:50,439
work right unless you're maybe unless

2808
02:04:48,670 --> 02:04:53,829
you're like Willie [ __ ] Nelson or some

2809
02:04:50,439 --> 02:04:55,779
[ __ ] and you know you ain't got no brand

2810
02:04:53,829 --> 02:04:57,729
like whether you're Master P or whoever

2811
02:04:55,779 --> 02:05:01,389
it is it's no brand so what I tell these

2812
02:04:57,729 --> 02:05:04,089
cats is is is make something first you

2813
02:05:01,389 --> 02:05:07,359
know do your own thing first yeah and

2814
02:05:04,090 --> 02:05:09,429
and and build your own business and then

2815
02:05:07,359 --> 02:05:10,899
you might be able to then you can then

2816
02:05:09,429 --> 02:05:14,319
you can leverage it into so much more

2817
02:05:10,899 --> 02:05:16,000
rather than just saying oh we're just

2818
02:05:14,319 --> 02:05:18,698
gonna make a lot everybody's doing that

2819
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:21,250
every every every every stars just like

2820
02:05:18,698 --> 02:05:23,079
license they [ __ ] and it's it's and

2821
02:05:21,250 --> 02:05:25,689
nobody's really know unless you're just

2822
02:05:23,079 --> 02:05:27,849
like like I said like Willie Nelson a

2823
02:05:25,689 --> 02:05:30,339
Snoop Dogg then it's like ain't nobody

2824
02:05:27,849 --> 02:05:32,289
really got a brand so Malak tell folks

2825
02:05:30,340 --> 02:05:34,029
build with cannabis cachet and do your

2826
02:05:32,289 --> 02:05:36,579
own thing and then and then launch that

2827
02:05:34,029 --> 02:05:38,859
[ __ ] absolutely absolutely I would say

2828
02:05:36,579 --> 02:05:40,599
this rack I had no idea that you were

2829
02:05:38,859 --> 02:05:42,670
sort of producing those hot box parties

2830
02:05:40,599 --> 02:05:45,969
but those hot box parties for DNA were

2831
02:05:42,670 --> 02:05:48,670
were a huge component of the there fount

2832
02:05:45,969 --> 02:05:50,260
of the foundation of their brand taking

2833
02:05:48,670 --> 02:05:53,859
off and blowing up because they were the

2834
02:05:50,260 --> 02:05:56,530
new guys in town in 2004 I think hotbox

2835
02:05:53,859 --> 02:05:58,689
started in oh five or oh six oh I think

2836
02:05:56,529 --> 02:06:00,488
we did ours in oh six or oh I think I

2837
02:05:58,689 --> 02:06:02,138
think we did the second or third one

2838
02:06:00,488 --> 02:06:04,718
yeah yeah okay cuz I don't know if they

2839
02:06:02,139 --> 02:06:07,150
did a hotbox party the first year the

2840
02:06:04,719 --> 02:06:09,038
year I met them was 2004 they were they

2841
02:06:07,149 --> 02:06:11,229
were brand new I remember we were at the

2842
02:06:09,038 --> 02:06:13,059
Melkweg we both had booths I was selling

2843
02:06:11,229 --> 02:06:15,098
the bubble bags and I looked around the

2844
02:06:13,059 --> 02:06:18,248
corner and here's these two [ __ ]

2845
02:06:15,099 --> 02:06:20,710
dudes with lab coats on and I'm like

2846
02:06:18,248 --> 02:06:22,359
what's up with these guys you know I

2847
02:06:20,710 --> 02:06:24,248
kind of walked over I'm the friendly

2848
02:06:22,359 --> 02:06:25,929
Canadian and I got and I've been going

2849
02:06:24,248 --> 02:06:28,599
to the cup for a while at that point I

2850
02:06:25,929 --> 02:06:30,730
was probably almost 10 years into

2851
02:06:28,599 --> 02:06:33,069
cannabis cups in Amsterdam so I guess in

2852
02:06:30,729 --> 02:06:35,078
a sense I wasn't a veteran a veteran

2853
02:06:33,069 --> 02:06:37,179
like skunkman Sam who's the the

2854
02:06:35,078 --> 02:06:39,069
grandfather of it or whatever but I was

2855
02:06:37,179 --> 02:06:40,929
I felt like a veteran sort of thing so I

2856
02:06:39,069 --> 02:06:42,939
was kind of going to welcome them they

2857
02:06:40,929 --> 02:06:44,590
had a bit of a different vibe like I got

2858
02:06:42,939 --> 02:06:46,268
the idea these guys were gonna be here a

2859
02:06:44,590 --> 02:06:48,730
little bit more than just for one or two

2860
02:06:46,269 --> 02:06:50,769
cups and that was sort of the passing of

2861
02:06:48,729 --> 02:06:53,379
the baton I don't know if you remember

2862
02:06:50,769 --> 02:06:55,659
this time accurately Sam but you know

2863
02:06:53,380 --> 02:06:59,260
prior to DNA showing up it really was

2864
02:06:55,658 --> 02:07:01,420
Doug and Adam from from THC seeds and

2865
02:06:59,260 --> 02:07:03,998
from hemp works that were sort of the

2866
02:07:01,420 --> 02:07:05,679
the go-to guys from America that were

2867
02:07:03,998 --> 02:07:08,590
kind of living in Amsterdam that were

2868
02:07:05,679 --> 02:07:12,099
super fun you know that's I met Jerome

2869
02:07:08,590 --> 02:07:13,569
Baker Chris Harris at hemp works back in

2870
02:07:12,099 --> 02:07:16,659
the day I think it was back then they

2871
02:07:13,569 --> 02:07:18,670
had it as the CIA cannabis in Amsterdam

2872
02:07:16,658 --> 02:07:22,210
or it might have even already passed and

2873
02:07:18,670 --> 02:07:24,038
been the KGB which was no good buds but

2874
02:07:22,210 --> 02:07:25,389

02:07:29,920 --> 02:07:34,840

2893
02:08:11,288 --> 02:08:14,579

2894
02:08:13,960 --> 02:08:19,899
first

2895
02:08:14,579 --> 02:08:23,229

2896
02:08:19,899 --> 02:08:25,029

2897
02:08:23,229 --> 02:08:26,589
you know what and those that those hot

2898
02:08:25,029 --> 02:08:29,229
box parties were a big part of that

2899
02:08:26,590 --> 02:08:31,270
obviously selecting good genetics and

2900
02:08:29,229 --> 02:08:33,159
selling seeds all around the world and

2901
02:08:31,270 --> 02:08:35,440
winning as many competitions as they did

2902
02:08:33,159 --> 02:08:38,229
was a big part of it but you know coming

2903
02:08:35,439 --> 02:08:40,779
out out of the gate right was was I

2904
02:08:38,229 --> 02:08:42,309
think was really important for DNA you

2905
02:08:40,779 --> 02:08:44,229
know yeah they were the new guys on the

2906
02:08:42,310 --> 02:08:46,570
Block in terms of genetics for me I mean

2907
02:08:44,229 --> 02:08:48,429
I remember when they they started coming

2908
02:08:46,569 --> 02:08:51,250
out it just was like who are these guys

2909
02:08:48,430 --> 02:08:52,570
and what's the backstory on it and they

2910
02:08:51,250 --> 02:08:55,449
really earned their keep over the years

2911
02:08:52,569 --> 02:08:57,069
yeah you know they're decent guys man I

2912
02:08:55,449 --> 02:08:58,420
mean just as people they're really you

2913
02:08:57,069 --> 02:09:00,849
know they they're they're just genuinely

2914
02:08:58,420 --> 02:09:03,039
nice people they're family people they

2915
02:09:00,850 --> 02:09:05,320
you know directly with their with their

2916
02:09:03,039 --> 02:09:06,729
family units but also with their with

2917
02:09:05,319 --> 02:09:08,170
their team of people they have a good

2918
02:09:06,729 --> 02:09:10,359
team of people around them and they seem

2919
02:09:08,170 --> 02:09:12,039
to care about them and and you know I

2920
02:09:10,359 --> 02:09:13,809
didn't I didn't come up with DNA

2921
02:09:12,039 --> 02:09:15,970
genetics I was a part of them becoming a

2922
02:09:13,810 --> 02:09:18,039
company or anything else but I do feel

2923
02:09:15,970 --> 02:09:20,710
like you know throwing those parties and

2924
02:09:18,039 --> 02:09:22,060
helping to you know obviously I make

2925
02:09:20,710 --> 02:09:24,270
music but I also have a degree in

2926
02:09:22,060 --> 02:09:27,340
advertising so I went back to school

2927
02:09:24,270 --> 02:09:29,350
instead of buying some of the chains and

2928
02:09:27,340 --> 02:09:30,579
the other things some of the cars never

2929
02:09:29,350 --> 02:09:31,930
you guys went back to school you know I

2930
02:09:30,579 --> 02:09:33,340
just done with those kind of people in

2931
02:09:31,930 --> 02:09:35,470
they end up getting my degree in

2932
02:09:33,340 --> 02:09:36,909
advertising so I had to go back and

2933
02:09:35,470 --> 02:09:38,170
understand marketing and branding and

2934
02:09:36,909 --> 02:09:40,989
everything else and trying to apply

2935
02:09:38,170 --> 02:09:42,970
those to the actual to the design and

2936
02:09:40,989 --> 02:09:45,369
the the branding aspect of the DNA was

2937
02:09:42,970 --> 02:09:47,260
doing but also to the actual experience

2938
02:09:45,369 --> 02:09:49,840
real marketing and an event production

2939
02:09:47,260 --> 02:09:51,550
and and out of you know non-traditional

2940
02:09:49,840 --> 02:09:53,140
advertising and looking at it that way

2941
02:09:51,550 --> 02:09:54,550
rather than just throwing a party I was

2942
02:09:53,140 --> 02:09:56,410
looking at it like out of home or

2943
02:09:54,550 --> 02:09:58,659
non-traditional advertising and we

2944
02:09:56,409 --> 02:10:01,210
really put that into what we were doing

2945
02:09:58,659 --> 02:10:02,739
with their brand and you know we kept it

2946
02:10:01,210 --> 02:10:04,060
strong it we never had any type of

2947
02:10:02,739 --> 02:10:06,250
falling out what ended up happening is

2948
02:10:04,060 --> 02:10:07,480
they really refocused on the state

2949
02:10:06,250 --> 02:10:08,949
standard of moving because they're from

2950
02:10:07,479 --> 02:10:12,159
here obviously from the state so they

2951
02:10:08,949 --> 02:10:13,539
did a kind of refocusing on on building

2952
02:10:12,159 --> 02:10:15,130
that was going on in Colorado in

2953
02:10:13,539 --> 02:10:17,229
California and all the stuff that's

2954
02:10:15,130 --> 02:10:19,359
happening right now and that became

2955
02:10:17,229 --> 02:10:21,759
their folk in Canada obviously was a big

2956
02:10:19,359 --> 02:10:23,139
focus of theirs and that became more of

2957
02:10:21,760 --> 02:10:25,390
their focus and doing these things but

2958
02:10:23,140 --> 02:10:27,670
if earlier this year I spoke to Don and

2959
02:10:25,390 --> 02:10:28,180
Aaron and they were talking about trying

2960
02:10:27,670 --> 02:10:29,800
to do some

2961
02:10:28,180 --> 02:10:31,270
they're some you know trying to bring

2962
02:10:29,800 --> 02:10:33,310
some hot box stuff back or doing some

2963
02:10:31,270 --> 02:10:34,660
other kind of events and other a lot of

2964
02:10:33,310 --> 02:10:37,270
other people I didn't even realize that

2965
02:10:34,659 --> 02:10:38,920
we're watching those events online or

2966
02:10:37,270 --> 02:10:40,470
that we're taking the trip out trips out

2967
02:10:38,920 --> 02:10:42,789
there just hearing from other people

2968
02:10:40,470 --> 02:10:44,500
have started to kind of reach out and

2969
02:10:42,789 --> 02:10:46,090
ask you know what's going on next year

2970
02:10:44,500 --> 02:10:48,189
what am i doing in April can I help them

2971
02:10:46,090 --> 02:10:50,230
to do this or they have any vamp ami and

2972
02:10:48,189 --> 02:10:51,669
after-party and you know it's it's an

2973
02:10:50,229 --> 02:10:54,849
easy thing to do to just hire somebody

2974
02:10:51,670 --> 02:10:56,319
that knows people to get artists to come

2975
02:10:54,850 --> 02:10:58,630
down especially when there's so much

2976
02:10:56,319 --> 02:11:00,909
disposable income floating around or

2977
02:10:58,630 --> 02:11:03,010
paper income a lot of different types of

2978
02:11:00,909 --> 02:11:04,539
ways to get happen but to actually bring

2979
02:11:03,010 --> 02:11:06,039
in the right people that understand what

2980
02:11:04,539 --> 02:11:07,329
it is and not just have the same people

2981
02:11:06,039 --> 02:11:09,789
doing the same thing over and over again

2982
02:11:07,329 --> 02:11:11,680
and and to understand how it connects

2983
02:11:09,789 --> 02:11:13,869
with the crowd today like it's a how to

2984
02:11:11,680 --> 02:11:15,700
present that visually there's a lot to

2985
02:11:13,869 --> 02:11:17,590
that and you know I've taken the time to

2986
02:11:15,699 --> 02:11:19,479
really dig in with that and that's

2987
02:11:17,590 --> 02:11:21,909
actually been my focus more so than

2988
02:11:19,479 --> 02:11:23,889
making music over the past couple of

2989
02:11:21,909 --> 02:11:25,979
years I do have some projects coming out

2990
02:11:23,890 --> 02:11:28,180
next year and in 2020 there is gonna be

2991
02:11:25,979 --> 02:11:29,949
some dilated stuff happening because

2992
02:11:28,180 --> 02:11:32,500
that'll be the 20 year anniversary of

2993
02:11:29,949 --> 02:11:34,420
the class OB we have an album called

2994
02:11:32,500 --> 02:11:36,279
2220 and that'll be the ten year

2995
02:11:34,420 --> 02:11:38,020
anniversary of my solo so 2020 there'll

2996
02:11:36,279 --> 02:11:39,550
be some things happening but overall the

2997
02:11:38,020 --> 02:11:43,870
past couple years managed pretty much

2998
02:11:39,550 --> 02:11:45,880
been production events branding and

2999
02:11:43,869 --> 02:11:48,069
marketing and I would say a good half of

3000
02:11:45,880 --> 02:11:49,619
that has been in in this particular

3001
02:11:48,069 --> 02:11:52,630
space you know like just working with

3002
02:11:49,619 --> 02:11:56,710
Billy a lot of artists the added artists

3003
02:11:52,630 --> 02:11:58,480
events art shows you know specialty like

3004
02:11:56,710 --> 02:12:00,189
hooking up you know somebody you know we

3005
02:11:58,479 --> 02:12:01,719
map someone it's a sort of particular

3006
02:12:00,189 --> 02:12:02,739
artist to do a particular project for

3007
02:12:01,720 --> 02:12:04,390
them and they needed something to happen

3008
02:12:02,739 --> 02:12:06,219
I had to come in and broker the deal and

3009
02:12:04,390 --> 02:12:07,810
work the whole thing so you know that

3010
02:12:06,220 --> 02:12:10,090
kind of stuff which put me in a unique

3011
02:12:07,810 --> 02:12:13,690
space to see the industry from a

3012
02:12:10,090 --> 02:12:15,340
different perspective then you know then

3013
02:12:13,689 --> 02:12:17,859
someone that's been a lifelong person

3014
02:12:15,340 --> 02:12:20,199
that's you know a lifelong grower or

3015
02:12:17,859 --> 02:12:22,000
cultivator or someone that's you know

3016
02:12:20,199 --> 02:12:23,800
just an outside person that's trying to

3017
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:25,420
throw some money at it and try to jump

3018
02:12:23,800 --> 02:12:27,670
into something to try to make their

3019
02:12:25,420 --> 02:12:30,460
money grow like I've I've been able to

3020
02:12:27,670 --> 02:12:31,989
work with both and I prefer to work with

3021
02:12:30,460 --> 02:12:33,850
the people that have the soul and have

3022
02:12:31,989 --> 02:12:36,550
the heart and have their roots in the

3023
02:12:33,850 --> 02:12:38,380
actual plant actually in the process

3024
02:12:36,550 --> 02:12:40,210
actually in the people but I also

3025
02:12:38,380 --> 02:12:42,150
understand the perspective

3026
02:12:40,210 --> 02:12:44,949
that the industry is changing

3027
02:12:42,149 --> 02:12:46,629
regulations are changing that's gonna

3028
02:12:44,949 --> 02:12:48,099
create opportunities and that's gonna

3029
02:12:46,630 --> 02:12:50,409
create problems and you have to be able

3030
02:12:48,100 --> 02:12:52,090
to navigate that imbalance you keep

3031
02:12:50,409 --> 02:12:53,769
yourself balanced as you're gonna be you

3032
02:12:52,090 --> 02:12:55,659
can't be triggered by these other things

3033
02:12:53,770 --> 02:12:57,520
in a way that's gonna shut you down

3034
02:12:55,659 --> 02:13:00,430
you'd have to if you if your goal is to

3035
02:12:57,520 --> 02:13:02,469
survive and to flow and to build then

3036
02:13:00,430 --> 02:13:04,119
you have to be able to stay balanced and

3037
02:13:02,469 --> 02:13:05,949
if you want to affect change and even

3038
02:13:04,119 --> 02:13:07,359
get certain things back or fix things or

3039
02:13:05,949 --> 02:13:09,639
just things then you have to have a

3040
02:13:07,359 --> 02:13:11,349
certain amount of power and resource and

3041
02:13:09,640 --> 02:13:14,050
influence and understanding in order to

3042
02:13:11,350 --> 02:13:16,690
really affect change yeah well said

3043
02:13:14,050 --> 02:13:18,219
absolutely I'll tell you I've definitely

3044
02:13:16,689 --> 02:13:20,529

02:15:27,779 --> 02:15:31,170
family we we did a lot of crazy stuff to

3106
02:15:29,970 --> 02:15:33,180
get there are a lot of a lot of late

3107
02:15:31,170 --> 02:15:34,649
nights we had a lot of fun too there are

3108
02:15:33,180 --> 02:15:36,119
those there's those hash you know

3109
02:15:34,649 --> 02:15:37,829
legends of hashed dinners and all those

3110
02:15:36,119 --> 02:15:39,119
things that I I'm not a legend of hash

3111
02:15:37,829 --> 02:15:40,409
by any stretch of the imagination but

3112
02:15:39,119 --> 02:15:42,960
some kind of way they always had a seat

3113
02:15:40,409 --> 02:15:44,189
for me it was good and you know like it

3114
02:15:42,960 --> 02:15:47,399
was it was just it's just a great time

3115
02:15:44,189 --> 02:15:48,899
you know the community I think it's you

3116
02:15:47,399 --> 02:15:50,099
know if some part of me is a little bit

3117
02:15:48,899 --> 02:15:51,329
sad because there are a lot of people

3118
02:15:50,100 --> 02:15:52,829
that are really good hearty people

3119
02:15:51,329 --> 02:15:54,750
really people with a lot of strong

3120
02:15:52,829 --> 02:15:56,279
integrity and that put a lot of their

3121
02:15:54,750 --> 02:15:58,649
their blood sweat and tears into this

3122
02:15:56,279 --> 02:16:00,840
and enter and aren't necessary

3123
02:15:58,649 --> 02:16:04,079
necessarily either they weren't able to

3124
02:16:00,840 --> 02:16:05,610
or they didn't make certain adjustments

3125
02:16:04,079 --> 02:16:07,590
to allow them to really you know thrive

3126
02:16:05,609 --> 02:16:10,259
but at the same time you know there's

3127
02:16:07,590 --> 02:16:12,329
you know there's still a part of me

3128
02:16:10,260 --> 02:16:14,430
that's really excited about the majority

3129
02:16:12,329 --> 02:16:15,750
part I'm really excited about the you

3130
02:16:14,430 --> 02:16:17,579
know the opportunities in the future the

3131
02:16:15,750 --> 02:16:19,739
potential for the future and and what

3132
02:16:17,579 --> 02:16:22,829
this community can be and you know the

3133
02:16:19,739 --> 02:16:25,170
community is is entrenched in a lot of

3134
02:16:22,829 --> 02:16:27,000
different places that are able to come

3135
02:16:25,170 --> 02:16:29,069
to light now because attitudes are

3136
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:30,810
changing the laws are changing and you

3137
02:16:29,069 --> 02:16:32,130
know there are always the front liners I

3138
02:16:30,810 --> 02:16:33,450
hate to see the front liners and I get

3139
02:16:32,130 --> 02:16:35,459
their respect it's the people that laid

3140
02:16:33,450 --> 02:16:36,841
it on the line for everybody else so

3141
02:16:35,459 --> 02:16:37,889
whatever we could do to support the

3142
02:16:36,841 --> 02:16:41,040
front liners while at the same time

3143
02:16:37,889 --> 02:16:42,599
pushing for for you know for continued

3144
02:16:41,040 --> 02:16:45,810
growth I mean that that balance is

3145
02:16:42,600 --> 02:16:47,819
always that I was thinking that earlier

3146
02:16:45,809 --> 02:16:50,519
when when mojo was talking about his

3147
02:16:47,819 --> 02:16:51,959
product to the CBD product and then Sam

3148
02:16:50,520 --> 02:16:54,091
was mentioning like I don't care if

3149
02:16:51,959 --> 02:16:55,800
every judge and policeman and I was like

3150
02:16:54,091 --> 02:16:57,569
you know what I see both sides but I

3151
02:16:55,800 --> 02:16:59,279
really love the idea of some of these

3152
02:16:57,569 --> 02:17:01,350
reggae artists that have been singing

3153
02:16:59,280 --> 02:17:04,110
about this for like 4050 years getting

3154
02:17:01,350 --> 02:17:06,630
their heads cracked opiate batons tossed

3155
02:17:04,110 --> 02:17:09,179
in jail you know treated like the lowest

3156
02:17:06,629 --> 02:17:11,489
regs of society singing about the

3157
02:17:09,179 --> 02:17:14,760
medicinal aspects of cannabis for like

3158
02:17:11,489 --> 02:17:17,010
decades it's like yeah they should

3159
02:17:14,760 --> 02:17:19,349
probably just be like oh they should all

3160
02:17:17,010 --> 02:17:20,519
have companies and products that that's

3161
02:17:19,349 --> 02:17:21,989
interesting yeah because I think it's

3162
02:17:20,519 --> 02:17:24,059
again and those that's happily true in

3163
02:17:21,989 --> 02:17:25,289
that but the other side the other group

3164
02:17:24,058 --> 02:17:26,789
of people are the people that are non

3165
02:17:25,290 --> 02:17:28,320
arted because the reggae artists at

3166
02:17:26,790 --> 02:17:29,790
least they usually have like a fan base

3167
02:17:28,319 --> 02:17:30,989
they have like moral support they have

3168
02:17:29,790 --> 02:17:33,240
people in the streets that are keeping

3169
02:17:30,989 --> 02:17:35,489
their name out there and and buying

3170
02:17:33,239 --> 02:17:38,069
their records and free so-and-so and

3171
02:17:35,489 --> 02:17:39,478
wearing the t-shirts but totally on top

3172
02:17:38,069 --> 02:17:41,218
of those people to me it's the people

3173
02:17:39,478 --> 02:17:42,659
that we're just doing it right the

3174
02:17:41,218 --> 02:17:44,279
people that legitimately cared about

3175
02:17:42,659 --> 02:17:45,718
people's health that are in jail that

3176
02:17:44,280 --> 02:17:47,610
maybe they're not even in jail right now

3177
02:17:45,718 --> 02:17:49,768
but they have to spend their entire life

3178
02:17:47,610 --> 02:17:51,179
savings or lose everything to fight to

3179
02:17:49,769 --> 02:17:52,800
stay out of jail or they you know there

3180
02:17:51,179 --> 02:17:53,879
are they gonna get there are there you

3181
02:17:52,799 --> 02:17:55,648
know some kind of way they're gonna get

3182
02:17:53,879 --> 02:17:57,089
the benefit or you know is there a fund

3183
02:17:55,648 --> 02:17:58,529
set up for these people that we can

3184
02:17:57,090 --> 02:18:00,269
measure that say you know what you lost

3185
02:17:58,530 --> 02:18:02,099
it all you some of the stuff that we're

3186
02:18:00,269 --> 02:18:04,889
pointing to as things that were able to

3187
02:18:02,099 --> 02:18:07,049
give this business moving to this level

3188
02:18:04,888 --> 02:18:08,609
or because you sacrificed you know ten

3189
02:18:07,049 --> 02:18:10,679
years ago twenty years ago five years

3190
02:18:08,610 --> 02:18:12,659
ago because you went to jail or because

3191
02:18:10,679 --> 02:18:14,159
you know you had your head beat in or

3192
02:18:12,659 --> 02:18:16,739
because you know you had your whole bank

3193
02:18:14,159 --> 02:18:18,000
account depleted by the government

3194
02:18:16,739 --> 02:18:20,069
everything taken from you they didn't

3195
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:21,599
give anything back you know and you know

3196
02:18:20,069 --> 02:18:23,849
what you know what can we do for these

3197
02:18:21,599 --> 02:18:25,349
people - I'd love to see these reggae

3198
02:18:23,849 --> 02:18:27,179
artists get out and go platinum but I'd

3199
02:18:25,349 --> 02:18:28,978
love to see the people that they go

3200
02:18:27,179 --> 02:18:31,049
diamond and get everything they deserve

3201
02:18:28,978 --> 02:18:33,388
for forgiving us theme songs and giving

3202
02:18:31,049 --> 02:18:35,308
us the inspirational music to push on

3203
02:18:33,388 --> 02:18:36,929
but I would really love to see these

3204
02:18:35,308 --> 02:18:38,819
front liners man these soldiers and put

3205
02:18:36,929 --> 02:18:40,110
it put themselves on the front line that

3206
02:18:38,819 --> 02:18:43,019
grew when they said it was illegal

3207
02:18:40,110 --> 02:18:46,170
before the county before the state when

3208
02:18:43,019 --> 02:18:47,790
the whole world was was was - treating

3209
02:18:46,170 --> 02:18:49,799
them as ridiculously as the feds treat

3210
02:18:47,790 --> 02:18:53,639
everybody I would love to see them get

3211
02:18:49,799 --> 02:18:55,349
some kind of you know benefit from this

3212
02:18:53,638 --> 02:18:57,239
directly as well some of them may even

3213
02:18:55,349 --> 02:19:00,299
be excluded from being involved in this

3214
02:18:57,239 --> 02:19:02,549
business because of what they did in the

3215
02:19:00,299 --> 02:19:04,500
past you know and it's really a unfair

3216
02:19:02,549 --> 02:19:05,879
situation for certain people you know

3217
02:19:04,500 --> 02:19:07,950
what I'm looking at I turn on the TV and

3218
02:19:05,879 --> 02:19:09,869
I see you know Marlborough just invested

3219
02:19:07,950 --> 02:19:11,849
a billion dollars into this well-being

3220
02:19:09,870 --> 02:19:13,889
while this person who thought everything

3221
02:19:11,849 --> 02:19:15,780
had lost everything well you know and

3222
02:19:13,888 --> 02:19:17,339
these other people who would have would

3223
02:19:15,780 --> 02:19:18,870
have would have gladly supported

3224
02:19:17,340 --> 02:19:20,700
whatever side was happening now they

3225
02:19:18,870 --> 02:19:22,350
have a billion dollar investments

3226
02:19:20,700 --> 02:19:24,120
like some of that money needs to go I

3227
02:19:22,350 --> 02:19:25,350
don't know kind of earmarked or taking

3228
02:19:24,120 --> 02:19:26,850
care of some of these things that beat

3229
02:19:25,350 --> 02:19:28,710
some of these problems they created I

3230
02:19:26,850 --> 02:19:30,780
mean you know they did it in they did it

3231
02:19:28,709 --> 02:19:33,149
in Jamaica in the sense that you know

3232
02:19:30,780 --> 02:19:34,829
like as regulations were coming into

3233
02:19:33,149 --> 02:19:36,539
place for Jamaica as they were gonna

3234
02:19:34,829 --> 02:19:38,760
allow business and government and they

3235
02:19:36,540 --> 02:19:41,010
the whole the whole of Jamaica was like

3236
02:19:38,760 --> 02:19:42,600
man the blood clots can it's gonna be so

3237
02:19:41,010 --> 02:19:44,729
corrupt it's just gonna be such a mess

3238
02:19:42,600 --> 02:19:47,520
but the one thing I thought they really

3239
02:19:44,729 --> 02:19:49,890
did right was they just were like they

3240
02:19:47,520 --> 02:19:51,479
were like okay the Rastas you guys can

3241
02:19:49,890 --> 02:19:53,039
just have this you can have you you know

3242
02:19:51,479 --> 02:19:55,439
you can sell it amongst yourselves

3243
02:19:53,040 --> 02:19:59,460
traded amongst yourselves grow it have

3244
02:19:55,440 --> 02:20:01,800
it you know you know set up booths to

3245
02:19:59,459 --> 02:20:03,449
sell it at a concert events and and rest

3246
02:20:01,799 --> 02:20:04,560
afar in events and I thought that was

3247
02:20:03,450 --> 02:20:06,120
pretty cool in a sense that they were

3248
02:20:04,560 --> 02:20:07,890
just like okay listen we got a

3249
02:20:06,120 --> 02:20:09,450
grandfather these [ __ ] in they

3250
02:20:07,890 --> 02:20:12,239
are gonna start singing songs on the

3251
02:20:09,450 --> 02:20:14,101
radio about us if they don't ya know I

3252
02:20:12,239 --> 02:20:16,140
think that's absolutely true I think

3253
02:20:14,101 --> 02:20:18,271
that's a it's great to hear that they

3254
02:20:16,140 --> 02:20:20,909
are you know decriminalizing or allowing

3255
02:20:18,271 --> 02:20:21,900
them to to do you know what they need to

3256
02:20:20,909 --> 02:20:23,640
do and what they liked it you know

3257
02:20:21,899 --> 02:20:25,979
especially because especially when you

3258
02:20:23,640 --> 02:20:27,449
don't live Rastas it's much more than

3259
02:20:25,979 --> 02:20:29,159
just getting high for the city getting

3260
02:20:27,450 --> 02:20:31,800
high it's a much deeper situation than

3261
02:20:29,159 --> 02:20:33,271
that much deeper situation that so but I

3262
02:20:31,799 --> 02:20:34,739
also there are a lot of rosters that are

3263
02:20:33,271 --> 02:20:36,480
dead right now you know there are a lot

3264
02:20:34,739 --> 02:20:38,039
of rust is in that same community that

3265
02:20:36,479 --> 02:20:40,109
are in prison right now like are they

3266
02:20:38,040 --> 02:20:42,510
vacating sentences are they are they

3267
02:20:40,110 --> 02:20:44,790
returning property are they supporting

3268
02:20:42,510 --> 02:20:46,380
the community that maybe has been taken

3269
02:20:44,790 --> 02:20:48,811
down by some of the policies that are

3270
02:20:46,379 --> 02:20:50,549
now beneficial to the government because

3271
02:20:48,810 --> 02:20:52,351
they're being taxed like that's the kind

3272
02:20:50,549 --> 02:20:54,449
of stuff that I'd like to see get you

3273
02:20:52,351 --> 02:20:56,130
know you can't go back and completely

3274
02:20:54,450 --> 02:20:57,480
you can't go back and undo anything

3275
02:20:56,129 --> 02:21:00,779
that's been done but you can definitely

3276
02:20:57,479 --> 02:21:03,299
do things to balance it or to to address

3277
02:21:00,780 --> 02:21:07,021
it and to try to make it a situate to

3278
02:21:03,299 --> 02:21:12,239
try to even the effect I guess on some

3279
02:21:07,021 --> 02:21:16,141
level every other business the

3280
02:21:12,239 --> 02:21:19,140
visionaries seldom end up with much

3281
02:21:16,140 --> 02:21:19,859
usually the bankers and the lawyers yeah

3282
02:21:19,140 --> 02:21:23,489
you're up early

3283
02:21:19,860 --> 02:21:24,900
that's reality ya know and but it

3284
02:21:23,489 --> 02:21:26,369
doesn't make you fear it makes it

3285
02:21:24,899 --> 02:21:32,279
absolutely reality it makes it

3286
02:21:26,370 --> 02:21:34,510
absolutely how things go but I'd like to

3287
02:21:32,280 --> 02:21:36,670
make it a little bit no

3288
02:21:34,510 --> 02:21:37,930
you know it doesn't concur on that yeah

3289
02:21:36,670 --> 02:21:39,520
it definitely doesn't have to be fair

3290
02:21:37,930 --> 02:21:40,930
but I'd like it to be fair I'd like it

3291
02:21:39,520 --> 02:21:42,310
I'd like to I'd like to I'd like it to

3292
02:21:40,930 --> 02:21:44,859
be fair when the opportunity and the

3293
02:21:42,309 --> 02:21:46,269
resources are there to address it if the

3294
02:21:44,859 --> 02:21:47,680
opportunity resources aren't there to

3295
02:21:46,270 --> 02:21:49,270
address it then that's one thing but if

3296
02:21:47,680 --> 02:21:50,680
you're if you're taxing people if the

3297
02:21:49,270 --> 02:21:52,060
taxes are coming in at the level they're

3298
02:21:50,680 --> 02:21:53,559
coming in and everything is coming out

3299
02:21:52,059 --> 02:21:55,299
the way that it is and they're actually

3300
02:21:53,559 --> 02:21:56,920
people still imprison from this because

3301
02:21:55,299 --> 02:21:59,188
here's the other thing the people that

3302
02:21:56,920 --> 02:22:02,409
are in prison for this are actually

3303
02:21:59,189 --> 02:22:04,300
making the state or the feds money

3304
02:22:02,409 --> 02:22:05,500
because you're charging for those bodies

3305
02:22:04,299 --> 02:22:06,699
to still be in prison so they're had

3306
02:22:05,500 --> 02:22:08,109
people in prison for something that's

3307
02:22:06,700 --> 02:22:10,090
legal now and they're still making money

3308
02:22:08,109 --> 02:22:12,460
off those people being in prison yeah

3309
02:22:10,090 --> 02:22:13,898
and the spend wages as well that's the

3310
02:22:12,459 --> 02:22:27,608
real money that's that's where we're

3311
02:22:13,898 --> 02:22:29,500
come iced-tea right without it I think a

3312
02:22:27,609 --> 02:22:32,050
part of the problem too is that with the

3313
02:22:29,500 --> 02:22:34,090
way it's being legalized or however you

3314
02:22:32,049 --> 02:22:37,509
want to call it there's no sort of

3315
02:22:34,090 --> 02:22:38,978
admitting like okay listen we lied we

3316
02:22:37,510 --> 02:22:41,620
were told we were not telling the truth

3317
02:22:38,978 --> 02:22:43,449
and we lied about all this and THC is

3318
02:22:41,620 --> 02:22:45,310
actually harmless and you don't need to

3319
02:22:43,450 --> 02:22:47,380
protect the children but they didn't do

3320
02:22:45,309 --> 02:22:49,629
that they came out still kind of not

3321
02:22:47,379 --> 02:22:51,969
admitting they lied still saying you

3322
02:22:49,629 --> 02:22:54,728
need to protect the children still sort

3323
02:22:51,969 --> 02:22:58,500
of like kind of creating this sort of

3324
02:22:54,728 --> 02:23:01,599
narrow version of what they want to be

3325
02:22:58,500 --> 02:23:04,359
small steps in the right direction where

3326
02:23:01,600 --> 02:23:06,279
they're eliminating any criminal records

3327
02:23:04,359 --> 02:23:09,850
for nonviolent cannabis that's that's

3328
02:23:06,279 --> 02:23:11,109
true yeah absolutely and that's and

3329
02:23:09,850 --> 02:23:13,329
that's what I'm that's the time stuff

3330
02:23:11,109 --> 02:23:15,279
I'm like as that happens more and it'll

3331
02:23:13,329 --> 02:23:16,568
this feels a little bit better to me

3332
02:23:15,279 --> 02:23:18,130
like the overall like and it doesn't

3333
02:23:16,568 --> 02:23:19,869
have to feel any particular way to me I

3334
02:23:18,129 --> 02:23:21,639
mean it's business it's its commerce at

3335
02:23:19,870 --> 02:23:23,740
this point it's regulated taxed it is

3336
02:23:21,639 --> 02:23:25,719
what it is but you know if we're talking

3337
02:23:23,739 --> 02:23:27,459
if we if the conversation ever drifts

3338
02:23:25,719 --> 02:23:30,340
over to hearts and minds it seems like

3339
02:23:27,459 --> 02:23:32,079
the the right thing to do - to make - is

3340
02:23:30,340 --> 02:23:34,359
to go back and say look if we've decided

3341
02:23:32,079 --> 02:23:35,978
that this is no longer illegal and the

3342
02:23:34,359 --> 02:23:37,210
reason we've decided that it's no longer

3343
02:23:35,978 --> 02:23:39,639
illegal is because we've done our

3344
02:23:37,209 --> 02:23:41,259
research and what we said the the

3345
02:23:39,639 --> 02:23:43,329
problems were with it we've decided are

3346
02:23:41,260 --> 02:23:45,609
no longer the problems with it then the

3347
02:23:43,329 --> 02:23:48,190
people in general that are dealing with

3348
02:23:45,609 --> 02:23:49,899
this should have the ability to

3349
02:23:48,190 --> 02:23:52,271
have that situation corrected and and

3350
02:23:49,899 --> 02:23:53,739
the fact that it is happening slowly in

3351
02:23:52,271 --> 02:23:55,630
certain certain parts of California and

3352
02:23:53,739 --> 02:23:56,920
hopefully across California and will

3353
02:23:55,629 --> 02:23:59,170
continue to happen that that's a good

3354
02:23:56,920 --> 02:24:00,969
day hopefully that that becomes the norm

3355
02:23:59,170 --> 02:24:02,620
wherever it's legalized like anybody

3356
02:24:00,969 --> 02:24:04,479
that's dealing with it that's had to

3357
02:24:02,620 --> 02:24:05,860
deal with it hopefully I mean it doesn't

3358
02:24:04,479 --> 02:24:06,789
hopefully the feds just get out there

3359
02:24:05,860 --> 02:24:08,200
and give it a head out their ass and

3360
02:24:06,790 --> 02:24:09,550
just just you know let it be what it is

3361
02:24:08,200 --> 02:24:12,670
but I mean that a lot of money will get

3362
02:24:09,549 --> 02:24:16,090
lost that way I read the news today that

3363
02:24:12,670 --> 02:24:19,840
the United Nations was thinking about

3364
02:24:16,090 --> 02:24:24,069
rescheduling cannabis they put off the

3365
02:24:19,840 --> 02:24:25,510
decision uh well of course they did I

3366
02:24:24,069 --> 02:24:34,750
thought you were singing a Beatles song

3367
02:24:25,510 --> 02:24:40,659
there I read the news today lucky man I

3368
02:24:34,750 --> 02:24:43,030
heard about South Korea from medical

3369
02:24:40,659 --> 02:24:45,250
yeah yeah that's empty big yeah I mean

3370
02:24:43,030 --> 02:24:46,870
I'm if people don't know this also is

3371
02:24:45,250 --> 02:24:49,959
that my mom is actually I'm part Korea

3372
02:24:46,870 --> 02:24:51,521
I'm my mom is from Korea so like when I

3373
02:24:49,959 --> 02:24:52,689
go I have friends out there a lot of the

3374
02:24:51,521 --> 02:24:55,000
musician a lot of the bigger bigger

3375
02:24:52,690 --> 02:24:57,340
artists out there are friends of mine

3376
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:59,110
and they're there they had like a

3377
02:24:57,340 --> 02:25:03,190
draconian laws out there they had laws

3378
02:24:59,110 --> 02:25:05,950
out there like hey that guy smoked huh

3379
02:25:03,190 --> 02:25:08,200
like you could tell that you could tell

3380
02:25:05,950 --> 02:25:10,630
the police that somebody down the street

3381
02:25:08,200 --> 02:25:12,070
smoked they could the police will then

3382
02:25:10,629 --> 02:25:13,119
go test their hair go do whatever they

3383
02:25:12,069 --> 02:25:16,209
have to do and they could say yeah I

3384
02:25:13,120 --> 02:25:17,380
smoked but it was in Amsterdam in them

3385
02:25:16,209 --> 02:25:19,329
they're like it doesn't matter you're

3386
02:25:17,379 --> 02:25:21,549
still a citizen of here of this country

3387
02:25:19,329 --> 02:25:23,110
and so as a result you might go to jail

3388
02:25:21,549 --> 02:25:27,579
for four years for smoking to join in

3389
02:25:23,110 --> 02:25:33,130
Amsterdam Singapore yeah yeah a lot of

3390
02:25:27,579 --> 02:25:34,479
things worse yeah at least we didn't

3391
02:25:33,129 --> 02:25:35,829
have the death sign I've been well I

3392
02:25:34,479 --> 02:25:36,819
think what Singapore where I'm not sure

3393
02:25:35,829 --> 02:25:38,709
I saw but it's like they have the

3394
02:25:36,819 --> 02:25:40,619
punishable by death like in full viewing

3395
02:25:38,709 --> 02:25:44,819
of horror

3396
02:25:40,620 --> 02:25:46,860
Malaysia pretty harsh is true

3397
02:25:44,819 --> 02:25:50,351
recreational you're up [ __ ] creek

3398
02:25:46,860 --> 02:25:56,620
medical is is now becoming legalized

3399
02:25:50,351 --> 02:25:58,870
right exactly exactly it's been legal

3400
02:25:56,620 --> 02:26:00,880
the whole time it's like it's crazy it's

3401
02:25:58,870 --> 02:26:02,181
so crazy I think some of the biggest

3402
02:26:00,879 --> 02:26:05,420
news that's come

3403
02:26:02,181 --> 02:26:07,940
recently in terms of like global change

3404
02:26:05,421 --> 02:26:10,640
is actually Luxembourg which is a small

3405
02:26:07,940 --> 02:26:12,950
relatively neighborhood countries

3406
02:26:10,640 --> 02:26:15,739
they're going to legalize and this is a

3407
02:26:12,950 --> 02:26:18,171
huge deal when it comes to the UN treaty

3408
02:26:15,739 --> 02:26:20,780
when it comes to they claim they're

3409
02:26:18,171 --> 02:26:24,290
going to tax it regulate and sell that

3410
02:26:20,780 --> 02:26:28,221
has not been done by a Western federal

3411
02:26:24,290 --> 02:26:31,790
no no it's it's so huge for Europe you

3412
02:26:28,220 --> 02:26:34,100
carry weight but in Canada but nowhere

3413
02:26:31,790 --> 02:26:36,891
in Europe I know and it's so big because

3414
02:26:34,101 --> 02:26:38,931
Luxembourg though they're small they

3415
02:26:36,890 --> 02:26:41,841
they they're they're they're basically a

3416
02:26:38,931 --> 02:26:43,761
de facto government for the EU you're

3417
02:26:41,841 --> 02:26:46,040
the directly converted middle everything

3418
02:26:43,761 --> 02:26:48,649
you got across this is their way that

3419
02:26:46,040 --> 02:26:50,870
European government is is held in its in

3420
02:26:48,649 --> 02:26:53,029
its in Brussels it's in Luxembourg and

3421
02:26:50,870 --> 02:26:55,311
it's in Strasbourg so those are the

3422
02:26:53,030 --> 02:26:57,681
three points but where the European so

3423
02:26:55,310 --> 02:27:00,079
where hell of a lot of people have their

3424
02:26:57,681 --> 02:27:04,700
money stashed exactly and also one

3425
02:27:00,079 --> 02:27:08,329
little caveat is been parked parked

3426
02:27:04,700 --> 02:27:09,650
that's - parked one caveat to the

3427
02:27:08,329 --> 02:27:12,140
Luxembourg thing is that they've been

3428
02:27:09,649 --> 02:27:16,459
when it comes to public corporations in

3429
02:27:12,140 --> 02:27:18,560
in Germany and nobody's there not being

3430
02:27:16,459 --> 02:27:20,270
allowed to go on the the DAX the stock

3431
02:27:18,560 --> 02:27:22,520
market and that's all controlled out of

3432
02:27:20,271 --> 02:27:24,980
Luxembourg and so when Luxembourg

3433
02:27:22,521 --> 02:27:26,780
legalizes there's all these though it's

3434
02:27:24,979 --> 02:27:30,261
just a small country there's all these

3435
02:27:26,780 --> 02:27:32,450
major ramifications throughout Europe

3436
02:27:30,261 --> 02:27:34,610
that'll have as well as the world

3437
02:27:32,450 --> 02:27:37,431
because they're so connected into the EU

3438
02:27:34,610 --> 02:27:41,301
and that's that that's that gives

3439
02:27:37,431 --> 02:27:42,620
hegemony for the for the UN that's

3440
02:27:41,300 --> 02:27:45,079
that's a lot of hegemony for that for

3441
02:27:42,620 --> 02:27:46,881
the UN to then kind of have a pass to

3442
02:27:45,079 --> 02:27:49,130
act because when you go to Europe and

3443
02:27:46,880 --> 02:27:50,989
you talk about like when Canada

3444
02:27:49,130 --> 02:27:52,939
legalized Germany Canada is putting all

3445
02:27:50,989 --> 02:27:55,369
his weed into Germany right now but when

3446
02:27:52,940 --> 02:27:57,440
Germany oh when Canada legalized now it

3447
02:27:55,370 --> 02:27:59,181
was not under medical auspices anymore

3448
02:27:57,440 --> 02:28:01,040
it was recreational and there was this

3449
02:27:59,181 --> 02:28:02,810
big thing in Germany whether they're

3450
02:28:01,040 --> 02:28:04,490
gonna be able to still import herb

3451
02:28:02,810 --> 02:28:07,970
because of the UN treaty now you never

3452
02:28:04,489 --> 02:28:09,681
hear Yankees talk about the UN treaties

3453
02:28:07,970 --> 02:28:11,091
because because we run that [ __ ] anyway

3454
02:28:09,681 --> 02:28:13,460
and it doesn't matter we do whatever we

3455
02:28:11,091 --> 02:28:15,409
[ __ ] want but in Europe they actually

3456
02:28:13,459 --> 02:28:15,829
like that [ __ ] matters like the Geneva

3457
02:28:15,409 --> 02:28:17,989
can

3458
02:28:15,829 --> 02:28:20,030
mention [ __ ] matters right and so

3459
02:28:17,989 --> 02:28:21,709
it's it's in their discourse in their

3460
02:28:20,030 --> 02:28:24,470
political discourse how they how they

3461
02:28:21,709 --> 02:28:29,770
determine how things are you know cannot

3462
02:28:24,469 --> 02:28:32,209
be done in any sort of compliance with

3463
02:28:29,771 --> 02:28:34,280
right and so and so what's happening is

3464
02:28:32,209 --> 02:28:36,829
there's examples are [ __ ] they're not

3465
02:28:34,280 --> 02:28:38,870
in compliant and complain compliance and

3466
02:28:36,829 --> 02:28:41,389
so it's chiseling away it's breaking at

3467
02:28:38,870 --> 02:28:44,570
it and I think if my personal opinion if

3468
02:28:41,389 --> 02:28:46,069
Luxembourg legalizes then I really think

3469
02:28:44,569 --> 02:28:47,779
that that is the beginning of the end

3470
02:28:46,069 --> 02:28:50,209
and I think we're gonna see Switzerland

3471
02:28:47,780 --> 02:28:51,500
legalized very soon thereafter I

3472
02:28:50,209 --> 02:28:52,879
remember when Switzerland I was there

3473
02:28:51,500 --> 02:28:54,590
when they were doing their marches in

3474
02:28:52,879 --> 02:28:55,670
Switzerland decriminalized I remember

3475
02:28:54,590 --> 02:28:57,049
there was a big deal when they do come

3476
02:28:55,670 --> 02:28:58,460
in but that I'm ever also about

3477
02:28:57,049 --> 02:29:02,770
Switzerland way back in the days the

3478
02:28:58,459 --> 02:29:06,619
potpourri like you couldn't arginine

3479
02:29:02,771 --> 02:29:08,300
that's old-school it was basically de

3480
02:29:06,620 --> 02:29:09,380
facto legal in Switzerland you could

3481
02:29:08,299 --> 02:29:10,909
smoke on the trains there was these

3482
02:29:09,379 --> 02:29:12,889
double-decker trains in german-speaking

3483
02:29:10,909 --> 02:29:14,629
switzerland there was a particular one

3484
02:29:12,889 --> 02:29:16,520
from Zurich to Lucerne it took about an

3485
02:29:14,629 --> 02:29:18,319
hour to get to and there was

3486
02:29:16,521 --> 02:29:19,640
double-decker trains and on the top was

3487
02:29:18,319 --> 02:29:21,319
where people was the smoking section

3488
02:29:19,639 --> 02:29:23,329
right but there was also this little

3489
02:29:21,319 --> 02:29:25,279
couch and little table [ __ ] right it was

3490
02:29:23,329 --> 02:29:28,850
hella dope and you would go up there

3491
02:29:25,280 --> 02:29:31,100
this is like 1998 right 1999 you go up

3492
02:29:28,850 --> 02:29:33,079
there and cats were smoking all over the

3493
02:29:31,100 --> 02:29:34,729
Train I've literally been on the train

3494
02:29:33,079 --> 02:29:36,709
had my beer had me like Oh spliff and

3495
02:29:34,729 --> 02:29:39,260
given my ticket to the conductor on

3496
02:29:36,709 --> 02:29:41,569
Switzerland and looking out at the Alps

3497
02:29:39,260 --> 02:29:43,670
and I was like man this is some utopian

3498
02:29:41,569 --> 02:29:47,360
[ __ ] I'll never have this you know this

3499
02:29:43,670 --> 02:29:50,120
is the most amazing a feel of freedom

3500
02:29:47,360 --> 02:29:53,450
I've ever had and then it regressed in

3501
02:29:50,120 --> 02:29:55,820
Switzerland right and now they're

3502
02:29:53,450 --> 02:29:58,280
they're going to then you know 20 years

3503
02:29:55,819 --> 02:30:01,129
late 20 you know 20 years later then

3504
02:29:58,280 --> 02:30:03,079
it's gonna it's gonna all come come back

3505
02:30:01,129 --> 02:30:06,109
and it's happening under CBD auspices

3506
02:30:03,079 --> 02:30:08,030
right now CBD [ __ ] smells and tastes

3507
02:30:06,110 --> 02:30:10,370
just like that so what the cops don't

3508
02:30:08,030 --> 02:30:12,950
even know what we smoked and what you

3509
02:30:10,370 --> 02:30:15,500
know exactly no you're absolutely right

3510
02:30:12,950 --> 02:30:17,930
it's it's you know seeing what's going

3511
02:30:15,500 --> 02:30:20,060
on over there it's really interesting I

3512
02:30:17,930 --> 02:30:24,500
was on the other side of it I was also

3513
02:30:20,060 --> 02:30:25,579
there when at the Cup in Amsterdam I

3514
02:30:24,500 --> 02:30:27,200
think I might have been the front of the

3515
02:30:25,579 --> 02:30:28,639
first Cup maybe the only cup that's ever

3516
02:30:27,200 --> 02:30:29,570
been raided like where they actually

3517
02:30:28,639 --> 02:30:31,399
came in and like

3518
02:30:29,569 --> 02:30:32,840
in that and they came in and they you

3519
02:30:31,399 --> 02:30:35,600
know they bear arrests in people so it

3520
02:30:32,840 --> 02:30:37,370
was a really ridiculous situation like

3521
02:30:35,600 --> 02:30:39,110
and and I don't know what it is I think

3522
02:30:37,370 --> 02:30:40,940
it's something where like there's the

3523
02:30:39,110 --> 02:30:43,550
community decides hey we're cool we're

3524
02:30:40,940 --> 02:30:45,170
good with this and then somebody else um

3525
02:30:43,549 --> 02:30:46,849
you know the kind of conservative voice

3526
02:30:45,170 --> 02:30:48,139
comes in to decides to come in and

3527
02:30:46,850 --> 02:30:49,729
regulate it then there has to be the

3528
02:30:48,139 --> 02:30:52,459
counter regulations to try to figure out

3529
02:30:49,729 --> 02:30:54,020
exactly what can be legal and I don't

3530
02:30:52,459 --> 02:30:55,699
really know but that's a good exam I

3531
02:30:54,021 --> 02:30:57,170
think that's a good analogy or a good

3532
02:30:55,700 --> 02:31:00,230
example what's happening in Switzerland

3533
02:30:57,170 --> 02:31:02,389
over the last twenty what has happened

3534
02:31:00,229 --> 02:31:04,969
where was the cup that we were talking

3535
02:31:02,389 --> 02:31:09,229
about the guy I was a party house got

3536
02:31:04,969 --> 02:31:10,879
raided remember 2005 got raided - yeah I

3537
02:31:09,229 --> 02:31:14,059
never I don't remember packs getting

3538
02:31:10,879 --> 02:31:15,949
raided I remember mm oh maybe they

3539
02:31:14,059 --> 02:31:17,389
switch they switched they stopped doing

3540
02:31:15,950 --> 02:31:19,579
it at the packs and then did it at some

3541
02:31:17,389 --> 02:31:22,209
other place well they the year I'm

3542
02:31:19,579 --> 02:31:24,500
thinking was in Eindhoven and it was it

3543
02:31:22,209 --> 02:31:27,409
was right outside of the city and they

3544
02:31:24,500 --> 02:31:33,680
so it wasn't in Amsterdam the mayor of I

3545
02:31:27,409 --> 02:31:36,860
know yes yes so guess who yes who got

3546
02:31:33,680 --> 02:31:39,290
searched first at that event they came

3547
02:31:36,860 --> 02:31:41,180
right to my [ __ ] booth like right to

3548
02:31:39,290 --> 02:31:43,400
my booth it wasn't even the closest one

3549
02:31:41,180 --> 02:31:46,280
to the door it was the furthest one from

3550
02:31:43,399 --> 02:31:48,409
the door next year they raided it again

3551
02:31:46,280 --> 02:31:51,620
and I'm sitting there with Doug from

3552
02:31:48,409 --> 02:31:53,030
hemp works and I'm like I'm like what do

3553
02:31:51,620 --> 02:31:55,430
you think the chances are that they're

3554
02:31:53,030 --> 02:31:59,420
gonna come and search us first and he's

3555
02:31:55,430 --> 02:32:01,280
like I think it's pretty high but I feel

3556
02:31:59,420 --> 02:32:03,350
okay about it because I don't have

3557
02:32:01,280 --> 02:32:04,820
anything and I'm like picturing in my

3558
02:32:03,350 --> 02:32:05,870
mind he's saying to me I don't have

3559
02:32:04,819 --> 02:32:08,029
anything and this is what I'm picturing

3560
02:32:05,870 --> 02:32:10,370
in my mind one of his friends from

3561
02:32:08,030 --> 02:32:14,720
Colorado it's kind of long scraggly

3562
02:32:10,370 --> 02:32:16,790
haired guy ate acid that day and he had

3563
02:32:14,719 --> 02:32:19,069
like a he had like a five gallon bucket

3564
02:32:16,790 --> 02:32:20,540
you know those like jars that close and

3565
02:32:19,069 --> 02:32:22,879
you can't open them it's like a vacuum

3566
02:32:20,540 --> 02:32:26,420
and like push the little button he had a

3567
02:32:22,879 --> 02:32:28,129
huge 5-gallon one full of herb and I saw

3568
02:32:26,420 --> 02:32:30,530
him like losing it on acid his whole

3569
02:32:28,129 --> 02:32:32,959
face was just contorting and I watched

3570
02:32:30,530 --> 02:32:37,010
him take that thing and hide it behind

3571
02:32:32,959 --> 02:32:39,169

3573
