31
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,439

33
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:36,389
cloud 9 well my wife and we can't hear

34
00:01:34,379 --> 00:01:38,188
it from from love when we got married

35
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:39,599
here and we just decided that this is

36
00:01:38,188 --> 00:01:41,309
what we want to be and was where we want

37
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,569
to start our family and we didn't know

38
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,640
what we want to do but we know what we

39
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:47,099
love and we love her and we figured out

40
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,890
what way could we give back and

41
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:52,408
make you feel good and actually have

42
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,780
health benefits at the same time so we

43
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:56,310
started a edible company and we didn't

44
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,019
really just start it like that I just

45
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:00,960
started making edibles for personal use

46
00:01:58,019 --> 00:02:03,090
and people like them and they just we

47
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:07,949
just started giving them away and people

48
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:09,390
came back yeah tell me a little bit

49
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:10,770
about your edibles not to cut you off

50
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:12,029
but like what kind of doses are you

51
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,200
putting in each one of these at Lowe's

52

63
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:47,250
as well we also have a lot of ice cream

64
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,659
is our best product actually really yeah

65
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,669
all right well I just had a little ice

66
00:02:48,659 --> 00:02:53,370
cream here but it wasn't cannabis

67
00:02:50,669 --> 00:02:54,929
infused next time maybe tell us about

68
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:56,670
the bud - I noticed that you really

69
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:58,140
you've connected with some growers that

70
00:02:56,669 --> 00:02:59,939
I know and some that I don't I'm sure

71
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:01,738
but it seems like you've really liked

72
00:02:59,939 --> 00:03:04,169
the bud that I held up to the camera a

73
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:07,560
second ago this is just a beautiful hazy

74
00:03:04,169 --> 00:03:10,219
like narrow leaf drug cultivar sativa

75
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:13,500
call it whatever you want this is just

76
00:03:10,219 --> 00:03:15,780
absolute fire this is this the same bud

77
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,759
that you gave Jesse royal earlier yes

78
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,709
this willow got a piece and protege

79
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:20,840
gonna do all right cool so we bumped

80
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:24,348
into Jesse royal

81
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:26,840
at the tomorrow today festival he spoke

82
00:03:24,348 --> 00:03:28,639
and we just stopped him and told him and

83
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:31,069
asked him if he wanted some dabs he did

84
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:32,119
not he didn't want some flower that we

85
00:03:31,068 --> 00:03:34,458
had I gave him a little bit of wobble

86
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,840
flour and then Mohammed gave him a

87
00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:38,269
little bit of this flour he was quite

88
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,340
excited about it so cool to know that

89
00:03:38,269 --> 00:03:42,049
you got that herb that the the artists

90
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:46,159
themselves you know it's that artist

91
00:03:42,049 --> 00:03:47,510
herb to the highest caliber actually I

92
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,549
love to know that it's growing

93
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:55,818
organically we use this herb to infuse

94
00:03:49,549 --> 00:03:57,860
our edibles so tell us about ear

95
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:59,479
processive you know nothing secretive

96
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:01,160
but whatever like generally like how are

97
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:02,899
you infusing your edibles what's your

98
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:05,389
process we like to thank the magic

99
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:09,230
butter machine and definitely we're

100
00:04:05,389 --> 00:04:11,568
using it with RSO oh nice quick watch

101
00:04:09,229 --> 00:04:13,789
okay yeah so you're making an extract

102
00:04:11,568 --> 00:04:15,199
and then you're using an extract you can

103
00:04:13,789 --> 00:04:17,959
even kind of tell because the cookie

104
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:20,060
just would not be the color of a cookie

105
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:22,459
if he had used cannabis it would be

106
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:24,829
green and so I think it said I think

107
00:04:22,459 --> 00:04:27,509
it's definitely like a good place to be

108
00:04:24,829 --> 00:04:30,269
where you're using like an oil or

109
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:33,389
or distal it or whatever to use as your

110
00:04:30,269 --> 00:04:35,250
starting process rather than flour yeah

111
00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:37,889
it just ends up all at 4'o and all that

112
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:39,509
greenery it just sort of produces

113
00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:43,289
something that's not quite as nice as

114
00:04:39,509 --> 00:04:44,670
what we hope this is awesome herb dude

115
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:46,020
we're going to get to go see protege

116
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:47,759

117
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:56,579

118
