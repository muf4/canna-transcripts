Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.

3
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:29,278
I am back on the electric skateboard

4
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:31,678
following the great gardener and Mr.

5
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:33,679
Chris Bennett and we're out for another

6
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:36,719
adventure. This is the third adventure.

7
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:37,920
Our first time out with Matt and uh

8
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,160
yeah, we're going to take you guys for a

9
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,879
little cruise along the seaw wall. Maybe

10
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:46,319
some dabs of some GG1 and some LHO

11
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:48,479
later. And uh yeah, keep you posted for

12
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,480
the

13
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:54,440
fun. Didn't see that coming. Eh, almost

14
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,960
went off the

15
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:58,799
[Music]

16
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:02,399
edge. I love this thing. This thing's

17
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:05,959
awesome. It's ridiculous, dude. Chris

18
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,960
has got the styles.

19
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,320
Yeah, it's really flexible. Chris was

20
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,159
telling me that it's like a snowboard.

21
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:25,039
He hit a bump and it almost Did it shoot

22
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,880
you off or almost? I did. It was I did

23
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,159
this afternoon. I hit a speed bump and I

24
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:32,158
landed and it sprung down so much that

25
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,600
it actually flung me off the board. It

26
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,159
was like a new sensation in

27
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:38,000
skateboarding along with that one right

28
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:41,200
there. Oh, that's another one. Isn't it

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,640
weird? Holy [ __ ] dude. You really got

30
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,560
to plant that back foot when you give a

31
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,799
guess. I could I'm taking this thing to

32
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,240
like Spain and stuff. Oh, yeah. Oh, it's

33
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,159
going to be ridiculous. You got to have

34
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:54,560
a crew though. That's the key. That's my

35
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:56,399
DNA skate army. Yep. DNA skate team. I

36
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:01,079
told D nail about them and how they need

37
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,079
to put a whip hole in the battery.

38
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:11,239
Now, let's stick to life's course now

39
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:17,800
and don't stray away

40
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:24,360
now to days that come. Yes. And seasons

living can change your

00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:48,000
ways. Let's start

47
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:51,000
over. There's so much so much to be

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
done.

49
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:57,000
I'll stick to the course

50
00:02:54,360 --> 00:03:00,120

00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:09,400
now. So on your mark, get set, and get

54
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,519

00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:45,798
today as

00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:47,650
yesterday it never

As the message in the

word you've never

69
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:03,680
heard, it remains the same unless time

Harsh reality of life come home to

00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:16,478
you. You're not hearing the message in

the words.

84
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:55,560
right. You're starting from 1 2

Let's

88
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:09,160
unite. Play your part and don't let them

89
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:12,960
sell you a six for a

You see them

00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:24,840
so so

94
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:27,800
blame that they will force it off on

a basket. Oh.

What's that? Oh, we still got a fair bit

116
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:38,360
of juice, though.

117

Sesh spot number one.

Sesh spot. Good spot. What's up? I said

120
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:57,469
is that a good spot?

00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:20,279
you tiny things you threw in

126
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:24,080
here? Yes, we threw a few tiny things in

127
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:24,079
there. Some big effing

128
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:32,478
boats. That was a real nice little ride.

129
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,680
Yeah. Every time I feel like I get a

130
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:37,918
little better. Sure. I'm sure you are.

131
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,000
It's playing with the bounce. Yeah.

132
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:41,758
Getting used to the bounce. There'll be

133
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,279
some cool things you can do in the half

134
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,479
bounce. Have you seen any of these guys

135
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:47,279
where they're like walking the

136
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:49,439
longboards and they're like they're like

137
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:51,038
turning like this and then stepping on

138
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:53,598
this foot, turning right and then

139
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:55,759
stepping and then I've been trying that

140
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:57,680
but every time it's just like Oh, this

141
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,120
stuff. Yeah. Yeah. And then you kind of

142
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,319
like the board's turning too. It's not

143
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,240
just like going in a straight line.

144
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,680
Exactly. When you do this it puts the

145
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,800
board over there. You really got to I

146
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,800
try, but then it's like I'm going to

147
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:11,800
break my ankles. It's good to try that

148
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,800
stuff without the uh motor.

149
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:19,520
Yeah. Well, that was about 7 minutes of

150
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:22,800
non-stop break for sure. Yeah. In case

151
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:24,318
you ever run out of juice. Absolutely.

152
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,960
Well, I'm down for having a quick little

153
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:30,319
dab, I suppose.

154
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:32,718
I suppose. I suppose. One up in you. The

155
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:35,200
classic one uppery. I'm gonna give away

156
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,800
a h 100,000. It's like a sweet. That's

157
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,039
how much? That's just gonna be sweet for

158
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:41,519
the grower.

159
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:42,718
That would be sweet for the grower. What

160
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,959
grower doesn't want? So, I don't have a

161
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:47,278
dabber, but I do have a Dodge key that I

162
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:48,759
put my dab onto. Oh, there you go. So,

163
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:51,399
I'll just

164
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:54,879
uh go with that, I

165
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:56,799
suppose. A little spot here. Oh, is this

166
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:59,039
like a regular uh pup spot of Chris

167

Bennett? H well my mom used to live

168
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:02,319
right around here so I've been down here

169
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,958
quite a bit but I guess it's like a

170
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,360
regular puff spot but I've cruise down

171
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:09,838
here on the board before I like

172
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:13,560
stretches with the nice curves and

173
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:15,600
stuff. Oh it was nice. I'm looking

174
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:17,879
forward getting a little bit further and

175
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:22,000
then I guess we'll have to turn

176
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:24,519
around charge a little back hill so that

177
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,159
should be pretty accurate. So much fun

178
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:29,360
dude. Oh, just like practical now. I

179
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:31,360
come over to Vancouver on the float

180
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,959
plane. You must love it. And I got that

181
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,200
thing. I'm getting like I don't use any

182
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:36,879
taxis. I got out of using taxis. I

183
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,320
started sort of using the whole day and

184
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:40,159
sort of walking around Vancouver and

185
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,480
really no really get to know. Now I got

186
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:44,319
the board and it's like sort of cruise

187
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,320
around around the block. I get to work

188
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,600
in the morning. I'm like totally pumped

189
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,278
because I've been carving all the

190
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:53,480
[ __ ] way off the sea wall to work and

191
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:53,480
by the time I get there I'm just like

192
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:58,879
and then zooming by guys on bicycles. I

193
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,560
pulled up to a stop sign today and I and

194
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:02,159
I and I hit the brake too much so the

195
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:05,278
board went backwards and it flew me off

196
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:07,759
like two steps and and the guy's like,

197
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:09,360
"That board's as big as a snowboard."

198
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:10,879
And I'm like, "Yeah, yeah." I go, "It's

199
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,600
really bouncy, too." And the light turns

200
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:15,439
green and I'm like, "And it's electric."

201
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,680
And I just took off and all I hear the

202
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,800
guy was like, "That's [ __ ] awesome,

203
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:22,239
man. Holy [ __ ] That's [ __ ] cool."

204
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:24,078
Yeah. Yeah. No, for sure. I get that

205
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,560
from all the time. There's so many

206
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:28,399
different ones, too. like it's uh you've

207
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:30,399
done it good by having like two or three

208
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,399
different ones to sort of kind of now

209
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,000
you can kind of see what's out there and

210
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,360
uh

211
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,399
yeah. Well, I'm looking forward to

212
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,839
trying one of those motor wheels. Yeah,

213
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,679
that's kind of the the next one I'm

214
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:45,120
looking forward to as well. There's a

215
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:46,958
couple that I saw that had uh just no no

216
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,200
big batteries and stuff. The motors were

217
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:51,278
much smaller, interchangeable inside.

218
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,079
That's another key. Even if these ones,

219
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:55,600
which are pretty big batteries, I I

220
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:57,439
would probably put up with two or three

221
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,079
of them in my backpack and and roll

222
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,920
around the city, if I could just, you

223
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:03,838
know, quick change them for for a city

224
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:04,879
dweller. For sure. Yeah, absolutely. I

225
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,880
wonder if any of these portable

226
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:10,000
vaporizer batteries have anything to add

227
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:13,600
to these, like how powerful they are.

228
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,639
Dail D nail should build the talk to

229
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,800
them today about it. Electric skate dail

230
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:20,480
with an attachable sort of dail on the

231
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:22,078
side. No, we literally talked to them

232
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,360
about it. Uh, well, I've talked to them

233
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:25,120
a little bit about it in the last week,

234
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,600
but today I'll buy one. That's what I'm

235
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,679
saying. I want I want on the list with a

236
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,040
hemp fiber deck. Hemp fiber deck. I

237
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:33,519
don't know if they got the hemp urethane

238
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:35,278
yet. There, dude. Definitely doable.

239
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,278
Game changers. What about the Aquabus?

240
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:39,200
What about like some like crazy hemp

241
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:40,639
battery out nowadays, too? There. I saw

242
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,640
some things about these hemp batteries

243
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:44,480
that they're making. I think they're

244
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:47,120
bigger type of uh a bigger type of

245
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,560
battery, though. That's cool. Should be

246
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,200
uh something that should be available

247
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:53,679
for sure. Carefully you don't step in

248
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,040
the bag of [ __ ] At least they put you

249
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:56,559
bag your [ __ ] up and then you leave the

250
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:57,919
bag.

251
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:59,919
That kind of defeats the purpose of

252
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:01,278
double or you got pollution on your

253
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:02,479
pollution. Exact. If you're going to

254
00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:04,078
leave it in a bag, then you're supposed

255
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,079
to put it on someone's doorstep and set

256
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:08,879
it on fire. So when they come to the

257
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:10,559
door and they stomp it out, you get [ __ ]

258
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:12,559
all over their feet. That's like the old

259
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:15,439
school like that's how you know that's

260
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:19,199
what a a hooligan was in the 70s. Nicki

261
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:22,000
Nikki Nine Dorse. Yep, there it is.

262
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,440
Nicki Knight. Knockk Knockock Ginger or

263
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,159
what was another name for that? I don't

264
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,360
know. We used to call people up and give

265
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:31,360
them boulder dash questions over the

266
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:34,159
phone. They were ahead of them. They'd

267
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,639
be like, I like it, man. It is a

268
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:38,159
beautiful day in Vancouver. And uh I

269
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,480
hope that you guys can come to Vancouver

270
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:42,879
one day and pick up a skateboard like

271
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,200
this, even for a rental. Maybe um

272
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:47,679
someone like Mark or, you know, someone

273
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,120
in the industry will will do 420 tours

274
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:52,000
of these skateboards because I'm telling

275
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:54,560
you, man, a quick little electric rip,

276
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,360
you know, a little uh restaurant action

277
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:58,799
or a vapor lounge, another rip. That's a

278
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,159
good idea. No, it's a great idea.

279
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:01,919
Certainly wouldn't go good with a bar

280
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:04,159
cruise, that's for sure. No, that's

281
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:06,078
that's what I difference between pot and

282
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:08,559
booze. You know what I mean? you go to

283
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:10,399
any like surf break, any snowboard hill,

284
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:12,719
you're going to find the hardcores are

285
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:15,759
all puffing down really heavy before

286
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,600
they go on the run or the ride and uh

287
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:20,000
it's good for these types of board

288
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,680
sports where you kind of like focus in

289
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,839
on on the ride and it just everything

290
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:26,319
else just kind of gets gets away from

291
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:28,480
you except it's the scene that's pouring

292
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,120
through your face as you cruise through.

293
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:34,680
It's the groove, man. Y the big fatty

294
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:36,959
and go on a ride on the groove.

295
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:39,679
Absolutely. It's uh I mean it was great

296
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:40,958
even before the Big Fatty, but it's

297
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:42,799
obviously going to be that much more

298
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:44,479
enjoyable after the the Big Fatty. It

299
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:46,958
reminds me of uh who was it? John

300
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:51,120
Stewart in the movie Halfbaked. You ever

301
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:52,638
gone longboarding on weed?

302
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,200
No,

303
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:57,759
no. Today you have You're on camera like

304
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:59,360
about to do it. Longboarding on weed.

305
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:01,360
Oh, the rights, dude. I don't think I

306
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,720
have gone long boarding not on weed.

307
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,480
That's what I'm saying. You know, like

308
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,199
it's like I do everything I do is on

309
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:11,278
weed. So, you know, I might wake waking

310
00:14:07,198 --> 00:14:13,359
up I I don't often wake up on weed, but

311
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:15,039
not long after waking up I am on.

312
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,360
Sometimes I do wake up. I wake up, I

313
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:20,159
smoke weed, I go back to sleep.

314
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,600
Sometimes wake up and got the joint in

315
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,838
your hand. It's in your mouth already

316
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:27,440
lit and everything like, whoa, that's

317
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:29,680
weird. How long have I been asleep?

318
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,600
Oh, yeah. Nice to see the boats out in

319
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:33,919
the water. Oh, it's killer, man. right

320
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:37,120
out on the water. Yeah, it's got to be

321
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:38,799
like 25 plus degrees right now. My uh

322
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,560
brother-in-law, he's got this boat. He

323
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:41,958
throws off a big wave that you can surf.

324
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:46,000
It's not the water

325
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:47,838
ski a wake surf. My uh my boat does that

326
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,919
as well. Have you been doing it? Uh

327
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,600
yeah, we do it. Yeah, it's quite fun.

328
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:53,838
You do it mostly in the lake. It's

329
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,800
easier. I was I was going to say that

330
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:58,560
way. Well, you got to go behind Gambir

331
00:14:56,799 --> 00:15:00,240
or you got to go like where it's classy,

332
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:03,119
but it's only certain times that it's

333
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,360
like that. So, no, not very often. More

334
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,679
ocean. It's wake boarding and wake

335
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,440
skating. I love wake skating. Wake

336
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:11,120
skating is just a board you stand on and

337
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,959
get pulled behind the boat. It's

338
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,039
unbelievably fun once you start learning

339
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:17,479
how to do

340
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:20,599

Vancouver commute, that's for sure. Seaw

00:28:13,038 --> 00:28:16,798
walls connect a lot. You know what I

554
00:28:14,558 --> 00:28:19,278
mean? If you got to go places and if you

555
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:21,599
go um bike routes Vancouver, there's a

556
00:28:19,278 --> 00:28:23,119
PDF that comes up that has all the best

557
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:24,480
bike routes. There's some that go like

558
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:26,158
along the roads, but they're separate

559
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,159
from the road. So it's they're nice and

560
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:32,360
wide in the greenways that you can

561
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:32,360
really whip through the city of Ardut.

562
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:39,278
Can't wait to see how big our team gets.

The braking.

572
00:28:57,759 --> 00:29:01,759
Oh, the braking is amazing, dude. It

573
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:03,278
teaches you how to ride a skateboard

574
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:06,359
differently than you ever would have in

575
00:29:03,278 --> 00:29:06,359
the past.

576
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:47,960
Which way are we

577
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:47,960
going? Straight.

578
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,880
Back at the fun truck and right on the

579
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,319
bottom blinking. That means that you

580
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,240
used most of your juice up on the

581
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:19,759
bottom. They just wink. That means that

582
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,519
you're just about out of Am I out of

583

fuel? Uh, yeah, yours. That's the

584
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:25,599
signal. It's this one here. That is like

585
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:26,798
means you're just going to run. So, I

586
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:29,359
can go around the block a couple more

587
00:30:26,798 --> 00:30:30,879
times. I'll be right back, guys.

588
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:33,278
That was awesome. I didn't think I was

589
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:35,919
going to film anymore, but uh that was

590

part one with Matt. Matt's going to fly

591

592
00:30:37,759 --> 00:30:42,558
