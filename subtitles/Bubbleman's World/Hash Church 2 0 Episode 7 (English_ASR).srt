1
00:00:02,509 --> 00:00:07,410
hey what's going on everybody welcome to

2
00:00:05,099 --> 00:00:11,279
bubble man's world and welcome to hash

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:14,070
Church 2.0 episode 7 kind of threw this

4
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:16,859
one together on a whim today didn't have

5
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:20,160
any invites that I put together or

6
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:22,019
anything like that just figured hey

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,149
we've got the ability to stream we

8
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:26,009
should we should get this happening and

9
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:29,459
put another put another stream together

10
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:31,830
so that is what I did I'm going to put

11
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,740
the invitations out via email and

12
00:00:31,829 --> 00:00:36,839
Facebook and messenger so we'll see how

13
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:41,550
that goes real quickly here boom boom

14
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:43,620
Shaboom hopefully mr. shallow mr. doctor

15
00:00:41,549 --> 00:00:45,629
shall dome will pop in and share some

16
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:47,699
goodness with us today Forrest says that

17
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:48,870
his internet is down at TS says he's

18
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,600
taken the day off

19
00:00:48,869 --> 00:00:53,789
and you got to respect that for a guy

20
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,989
that's pretty much been here for every

21
00:00:53,789 --> 00:01:00,659
single hash Church episode already 171

22
00:00:57,988 --> 00:01:03,000
viewers in the house Johnny B comes in

23
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:06,090
and blows my eardrums out classic

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:12,179
probably on a phone or something that

25
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:15,929
was so loud Johnny B Wow good to see you

26
00:01:12,179 --> 00:01:17,759
though he's like oh I'm afraid to unmute

27
00:01:15,929 --> 00:01:24,090
it I might blow his eardrums out again

28
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:29,299
oh you gotta love it Johnny be classic

29
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:33,299
Johnny B hey what's going on dr. mark

30
00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:37,289
hey Marcus oh yeah I'm good dude how

31
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:40,560
about yourself good oh well it's been a

32
00:01:37,289 --> 00:01:44,399
while yeah

33
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:47,569
tell ya what what's been new and

34
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:50,060
different in the world of dr. mark

35
00:01:47,569 --> 00:01:55,889
concerts in chemistry

36
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:59,789
yeah well been busy starting up a couple

37
00:01:55,888 --> 00:02:04,438
facilities one about two hours south and

38
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:06,388
where I live in Maryland and got a

39
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:10,340
couple other projects going on in other

40
00:02:06,388 --> 00:02:14,789
states but I'm still working on

41
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:17,310
hydrogenation and have

42
00:02:14,789 --> 00:02:21,048
potential collaboration to do the

43
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:23,098
pharmacology on that but we're in

44
00:02:21,049 --> 00:02:28,459
discussion right now with a licensed

45
00:02:23,098 --> 00:02:30,238
producer in California to do a limited

46
00:02:28,459 --> 00:02:32,579
introduction of I think we're going to

47
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:35,938
make like a thousand pens or maybe like

48
00:02:32,579 --> 00:02:37,530
1500 pens I'm not sure it's stolen sort

49
00:02:35,938 --> 00:02:39,840
of negotiation but we're still you know

50
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:45,359
developing the hydrogenation technology

51
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:48,120
and getting labs started up in in

52
00:02:45,359 --> 00:02:56,159
multiple different states and projects

53
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:57,989
in Florida North Dakota Ohio the

54
00:02:56,158 --> 00:03:00,060
Pennsylvania project was sort of put on

55
00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:03,509
hold because there's a lawsuit the

56
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:07,560
existing license holders right now are

57
00:03:03,509 --> 00:03:09,509
suing the state for the hold on their

58
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,609
clinical program so that's kind of a

59
00:03:09,509 --> 00:03:13,918
bummer that is a bunch of the great

60
00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:17,760
group that I'm associated with is sort

61
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:21,139
of like taking a hiatus until that issue

62
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:24,228
gets resolved but you know this is

63
00:03:21,139 --> 00:03:27,750
basically groups that are you know

64
00:03:24,229 --> 00:03:30,930
consists of like myself as a processing

65
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:33,389
guy like a cultivation team a security

66
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:38,760
team and basically putting together a

67
00:03:33,389 --> 00:03:40,500
plan to retrofit existing facilities or

68
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:43,759
in some cases build entirely new

69
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:46,378
buildings for you know the purpose of

70
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:48,388
you know growing and cultivating

71
00:03:46,378 --> 00:03:50,489
cannabis and in most cases because I'm

72
00:03:48,389 --> 00:03:55,260
associated with it you know processing

73
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:56,729
into oils and formulator products so the

74
00:03:55,259 --> 00:03:58,438
regulations are all different in

75
00:03:56,729 --> 00:04:02,909
different states but basically it's the

76
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:05,158
same you know type of process that you

77
00:04:02,908 --> 00:04:09,780
know you would use for any type of

78
00:04:05,158 --> 00:04:12,590
botanical essential oil and so yeah so a

79
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:15,419
lot of these are states are allowing

80
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:20,280
solvent and non solvent extraction

81
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:23,250
methods some folks are sort of limiting

82
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:26,250
their processing right now so I know

83
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:28,680
folks who are doing only co2 we're

84
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:34,410
choosing to do solvent lists

85
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:36,418
you know rawson and and butane extracts

86
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:40,919
just because the butane extracts a very

87
00:04:36,418 --> 00:04:42,529
popular category right now amongst these

88
00:04:40,918 --> 00:04:46,370
new states but yeah I mean the

89
00:04:42,529 --> 00:04:50,549
introduction of concentrates to the

90
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:55,019
markets in Pennsylvania and Maryland has

91
00:04:50,550 --> 00:05:00,538
been very successful and we're seeing

92
00:04:55,019 --> 00:05:03,240
incredible growth and great tamir who

93
00:05:00,538 --> 00:05:08,069
worked with kind bill out in colorado is

94
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:09,629
now running in a lab in Cresco in in

95
00:05:08,069 --> 00:05:10,199
pennsylvania and they're doing really

96
00:05:09,629 --> 00:05:12,478
really well

97
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:15,419
you know they can't keep their their

98
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:17,990
concentrates on the shelves so things

99
00:05:15,418 --> 00:05:21,598
are going well in the rollout of

100
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:23,430
cannabis facilities out east in the

101
00:05:21,598 --> 00:05:30,209
united states it's great it's good the

102
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:33,660
report yeah welcome Kevin good morning

103
00:05:30,209 --> 00:05:35,969
everyone are you doing well you know

104
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:39,419
another sunday another hash Church

105
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:41,010
episode seven this time figured we'd you

106
00:05:39,418 --> 00:05:43,409
know throat throw one together without

107
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:45,389
any organization whatsoever just sort of

108
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:49,439
do it old-school see who's around see

109
00:05:45,389 --> 00:05:57,870
what the conversation can what we can

110
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:59,759
come up with good is that your YouTube

111
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:01,439
is someone left their YouTube on that I

112
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:08,969
can hear myself talking through just out

113
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:14,550
of curiosity welcome skunk man Sam Sam's

114
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:17,190
I can hear it through Sam's a scourge

115
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:19,050
foul that's true well you know what I

116
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:20,879
did it when I had my headphones on this

117
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:21,960
morning so it didn't it nobody heard it

118
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:24,060
except me

119
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:39,349
but I definitely did it hey anyone got

120
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:43,819
melt turn your YouTube off Sam I mean

121
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:45,920
I'm trying well go to the YouTube and

122
00:06:43,819 --> 00:06:52,699
then mute it or just shut it off

123
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:54,890
completely awesome welcome Johnny be

124
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:56,629
welcome and yeah I was you know what I

125
00:06:54,889 --> 00:06:58,879
had a question mark in regards to your

126
00:06:56,629 --> 00:07:01,129
hydrogenation process I'm not really

127
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:02,839
fully understanding exactly what's going

128
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:04,909
on there what the benefits are how you

129
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:06,709
came up with this can you kind of give

130
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:08,570
us a little bit of a I'm sure you've

131
00:07:06,709 --> 00:07:11,959
talked about it before but just sort of

132
00:07:08,569 --> 00:07:17,709
for the people like myself sure I would

133
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:22,009
be awesome yeah so what we do when we

134
00:07:17,709 --> 00:07:24,649
convert the tetrahydrocannabinol is

135
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:26,920
which are in the plant to the hex up

136
00:07:24,649 --> 00:07:29,899
higher cannabinoids as we're adding a

137
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:37,340
molecule of hydrogen across the double

138
00:07:29,899 --> 00:07:39,319
bond of the molecule THC a or CBD a or

139
00:07:37,339 --> 00:07:43,159
you know whatever we're hydrogenating in

140
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:45,879
a plant so so the the double bond is the

141
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:49,040
if you're looking at the structure of

142
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:51,469
THC a it's sort of like the the

143
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:54,920
chicken-wire representation sort of like

144
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:57,500
of what the molecule looks like there's

145
00:07:54,920 --> 00:08:01,610
a there's the top ring at the top of the

146
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:04,040
ring the top of the three rings there

147
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:06,020
there's there's a double bond and that

148
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:10,510
double bond is eliminated when it's

149
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:14,509
hydrogenated so we're saturating the

150
00:08:10,509 --> 00:08:16,670
double bond by adding hydrogen to it and

151
00:08:14,509 --> 00:08:18,289
making it go away so whether it's Delta

152
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:22,520
eight or Delta nine those are different

153
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:24,650
positions different isomer isomeric

154
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:26,930
positions of the double bond and

155
00:08:24,649 --> 00:08:28,310
depending on which isomer you have it

156
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:31,939
doesn't make a difference in works we've

157
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:34,299
hydrogenated so the hydrogenation

158
00:08:31,939 --> 00:08:36,649
basically is a way of converting the

159
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:40,069
tetrahydrocannabinol that are in the

160
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:44,059
plant into the hexahydrate cannabinoids

161
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:47,120
which is what h8 CA is so does that make

162
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:48,979
sense I mean that makes pretty damn good

163
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:53,139
sense and what have you seen sort of

164
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:56,629
beneficial from turning tetra to hexa

165
00:08:53,139 --> 00:08:59,180
so the data that we had presented in our

166
00:08:56,629 --> 00:09:01,610
patent was some data that showed that

167
00:08:59,179 --> 00:09:05,539
mice that were implanted with

168
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:07,970
glioblastoma tumors had slightly smaller

169
00:09:05,539 --> 00:09:10,429
tumors when they had a diet of the

170
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:15,649
hydrogenated cannabinoids versus the

171
00:09:10,429 --> 00:09:18,620
diet of their non-hydrogenated starting

172
00:09:15,649 --> 00:09:20,600
material yeah and that was part of the

173
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:22,070
reason why we got on an invention on it

174
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:25,190
because you couldn't have predicted that

175
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:27,290
result until we till we carried it out

176
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:29,810
and it was like new and unexpected it's

177
00:09:27,289 --> 00:09:33,828
like whoo surprisingly if you find that

178
00:09:29,809 --> 00:09:37,989
and so the reduction in tumor size was

179
00:09:33,828 --> 00:09:40,099
just a little bit smaller in the

180
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:41,419
hydrogenated cannabinoids and that might

181
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:45,050
have to do with again they have

182
00:09:41,419 --> 00:09:47,028
different metabolic profiles in the body

183
00:09:45,049 --> 00:09:48,740
and so how they're degraded and what

184
00:09:47,028 --> 00:09:51,289
kind of half-life they may or may not

185
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:53,690
have all the kind of activity is

186
00:09:51,289 --> 00:09:57,198
directly tied to making those tumors

187
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:59,690
slightly smaller I mean the mice that

188
00:09:57,198 --> 00:10:03,049
had no cannabinoids administered him at

189
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:05,720
all had you know much larger tumors so

190
00:10:03,049 --> 00:10:09,649
that cannabinoids in the diet showed a

191
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:12,019
tumor a reduction in tumor size but you

192
00:10:09,649 --> 00:10:13,669
know ultimately this is something that

193
00:10:12,019 --> 00:10:17,269
you know it was just used to show that

194
00:10:13,669 --> 00:10:22,429
these things do have biological activity

195
00:10:17,269 --> 00:10:27,440
for the utility on a mark I'm curious if

196
00:10:22,429 --> 00:10:29,689
it aren't either you can name several

197
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,370
double bonds in the resorcinol no DM THC

198
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:36,230
did those things get hydrogenated as

199
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:38,209
well when you guys treat this no so just

200
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:42,110
the single double bond the methyl

201
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:45,109
cyclohexene group so that the the the

202
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:47,329
benzene that stable and does not is not

203
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:49,490
Hydra

204
00:10:47,328 --> 00:10:52,099
but another thing that we were able to

205
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:54,350
show is that we can hydrogenate the acid

206
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:58,040
group itself and when we hydrogenate the

207
00:10:54,350 --> 00:11:00,139
acid group we make a hydroxymethyl so we

208
00:10:58,039 --> 00:11:05,058
convert what used to be a carboxylic

209
00:11:00,139 --> 00:11:07,278
acid into now there are many methanol

210
00:11:05,058 --> 00:11:09,259
matter that we've covered in our that

211
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:11,808
our patent so we're sort of developing

212
00:11:09,259 --> 00:11:13,489
you know ways to not only and when you

213
00:11:11,808 --> 00:11:16,548
do the hydrogenation this is an

214
00:11:13,489 --> 00:11:18,649
important aspect of it too it generates

215
00:11:16,548 --> 00:11:20,808
two diastereomers because the

216
00:11:18,649 --> 00:11:23,328
hydrogenation could happen from the top

217
00:11:20,808 --> 00:11:25,759
side of the molecule mm-hmm which pushes

218
00:11:23,328 --> 00:11:26,688
the methyl group back and makes a

219
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:28,519
stereocenter

220
00:11:26,688 --> 00:11:31,038
because the the new stereocenter is a

221
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:33,379
tetrahedral carbon which is a symmetric

222
00:11:31,038 --> 00:11:36,259
right and so the methyl group will go

223
00:11:33,379 --> 00:11:39,739
sort of like down into the plane of the

224
00:11:36,259 --> 00:11:42,469
computer screen or a catalyst comes from

225
00:11:39,739 --> 00:11:45,739
underneath the methyl group goes outside

226
00:11:42,469 --> 00:11:47,209
the computer screen so so those are

227
00:11:45,739 --> 00:11:48,699
think about there yeah let's get

228
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:50,538
different properties right right

229
00:11:48,698 --> 00:11:55,278
right-handed and a left-handed

230
00:11:50,538 --> 00:11:57,348
diastereomer so last year a group at the

231
00:11:55,278 --> 00:12:00,278
University of Pennsylvania collaborated

232
00:11:57,349 --> 00:12:05,439
with El Sol II and published a paper on

233
00:12:00,278 --> 00:12:08,629
the modeling of oxygenated cannabinoids

234
00:12:05,438 --> 00:12:13,668
inside the cb1 receptor site as you all

235
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:16,308
know now the cb1 receptor sites crystal

236
00:12:13,668 --> 00:12:19,869
structure has been solved by basically

237
00:12:16,308 --> 00:12:23,838
Criss crystallizing a high affinity

238
00:12:19,869 --> 00:12:26,829
ligand for the receptor and basically

239
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:29,479
doing very very sophisticated

240
00:12:26,828 --> 00:12:31,728
crystallography work tied together with

241
00:12:29,479 --> 00:12:35,149
computation to basically solve with the

242
00:12:31,729 --> 00:12:39,169
inside of these receptors look like so

243
00:12:35,149 --> 00:12:41,798
I've started a collaboration with the

244
00:12:39,168 --> 00:12:44,178
group up at UPenn on modeling

245
00:12:41,798 --> 00:12:47,178
hydrogenated cannabinoids as it turns

246
00:12:44,178 --> 00:12:49,399
out that part of the active site is very

247
00:12:47,178 --> 00:12:52,418
sterically promiscuous and that there

248
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:55,009
can accommodate a lot of different

249
00:12:52,418 --> 00:12:57,198
stereochemical baggage if you will or

250
00:12:55,009 --> 00:13:01,219
clutter because there's a lot of there's

251
00:12:57,198 --> 00:13:05,178
a huge hydrophobic clef or cavity inside

252
00:13:01,219 --> 00:13:10,159
the active site of cb1 and so we're

253
00:13:05,178 --> 00:13:14,568
actually modeling both the right-handed

254
00:13:10,158 --> 00:13:16,698
and the left-handed diastereomer inside

255
00:13:14,568 --> 00:13:18,349
the active site and definitely seeing

256
00:13:16,698 --> 00:13:20,569
some slight differences but

257
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:23,920
two diastereomers we don't have them

258
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:28,879
separated just yet I can separate them

259
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:32,269
chromatographic Li by HPLC so I would

260
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:35,240
need to do by preppy HPLC and I'm still

261
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:37,399
working on a method for that and

262
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:40,580
basically carrying that out to basically

263
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:45,590
separate the two diastereomers that are

264
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:47,840
made when pure crystalline delta-9 which

265
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:49,970
is purified and isolated and we have

266
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:52,070
really really good NMR data to say

267
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:56,320
that's very very pure when we

268
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:58,940
hydrogenate that we see about a

269
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,980
one-to-one mixture of each of the

270
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:03,620
diastereomer so we're trying to separate

271
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:05,450
those right now but again under slightly

272
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:08,960
different reaction conditions we could

273
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:12,610
reduce the acids down to the hydroxy

274
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:15,040
methyl groups which create a bun dn't

275
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:19,399
opportunities now to do further

276
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:21,709
chemistry to see how far we can push new

277
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:23,720
groups into that hydrophobic pocket is

278
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:25,250
cb1 and we just don't know because these

279
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:27,710
compounds have never been made before

280
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:29,269
but you know we'll we'll start making a

281
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:32,379
whole bunch of derivatives here and

282
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:35,059
testing them so that's kind of cool you

283
00:14:32,379 --> 00:14:37,700
know we even put out a paper maybe

284
00:14:35,059 --> 00:14:40,159
you're so ago on a DNA variants in scene

285
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:43,970
r1 that may have an impact on the

286
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:45,799
structure and gentleman as mariana says

287
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:48,550
live up here in bosses and i think

288
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:50,599
played a role in that crystal structure

289
00:14:48,549 --> 00:14:52,459
and they're up there they probably are

290
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,990
to where the population if you guys to

291
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:55,790
be concerned right now but they're an

292
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:56,870
interesting interesting dynamic that

293
00:14:55,789 --> 00:14:59,000
crystal structures helped tremendously

294
00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:02,899
being able to now predict things like

295
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:06,019
this which is great are you guys gonna

296
00:15:02,899 --> 00:15:11,899
be present at the I CRS and Leiden

297
00:15:06,019 --> 00:15:13,519
Holland next month I will not be I've

298
00:15:11,899 --> 00:15:15,649
got a I've got another conflicting thing

299
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:19,879
this year but looking forward to next

300
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:21,679
year yeah I've never been before I'm

301
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:23,629
this will be my first year I know Sam's

302
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:25,819
been going for decades or whatnot

303
00:15:23,629 --> 00:15:27,529
however long it's been around for but

304
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:29,390
this will be my first year I'm looking

305
00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:31,559
very forward to it it seems like it

306
00:15:29,389 --> 00:15:33,389
seems like what you've been doing

307
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:34,619
would be very much up their alley for a

308
00:15:33,389 --> 00:15:38,009
presentation though

309
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:40,500
yeah I've been dying to go

310
00:15:38,009 --> 00:15:48,179
I'm not going this year I forget why it

311
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:50,580
must inflict with the fish or the earth

312
00:15:48,179 --> 00:15:53,278
towards something I I forget the reason

313
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:54,028
why I'm not going but I discussed what

314
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:57,629
is Glenn

315
00:15:54,028 --> 00:16:00,809
Ryan at length and Ryan had been tugging

316
00:15:57,629 --> 00:16:03,629
on me to go for years Marcus and yes

317
00:16:00,809 --> 00:16:06,869
definitely I'm going to go it just not

318
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:09,929
this particular one but yeah so you next

319
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:12,210
so Sam you just can't figure out how to

320
00:16:09,929 --> 00:16:13,679
shut off the YouTube chat so we don't

321
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:15,990
have to hear our voices coming through

322
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:22,409
your microphone it's it's just a it's a

323
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:24,330
mute button on YouTube I'm gonna mute it

324
00:16:22,409 --> 00:16:26,189
for now cuz I can't that's like my pet

325
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:27,810
peeve numero uno but I'm sure he'll

326
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:30,180
figure out how to shut off the YouTube

327
00:16:27,809 --> 00:16:32,278
chat it's different from the Google Chat

328
00:16:30,179 --> 00:16:34,588
you go into the YouTube chat where the

329
00:16:32,278 --> 00:16:37,919
actual chat is happening and you just

330
00:16:34,589 --> 00:16:39,720
mute the the talking on there and it's

331
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:42,029
you can turn the sound right down or you

332
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:44,339
can click the little bell and it'll just

333
00:16:42,029 --> 00:16:46,470
mute but yeah that's or just shut it

334
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:49,200
completely off if you just closed the

335
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:51,629
whole page it'll also stop so that's

336
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:53,040
super interesting mark I don't know why

337
00:16:51,629 --> 00:16:54,750
I didn't really catch on to that the

338
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:58,829
other times that you explained that but

339
00:16:54,750 --> 00:17:02,549
that's very just unique yeah I mean I

340
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:05,880
had worked on this project why I was

341
00:17:02,549 --> 00:17:09,029
employed at DuPont to take catmint

342
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:12,030
oil which we obtained by steam

343
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:14,549
distillation and in hydrogenate that oil

344
00:17:12,029 --> 00:17:18,420
soake atman oil itself is a very

345
00:17:14,549 --> 00:17:21,750
fragrant pungent almost very overly

346
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:24,000
powering herbaceous material and in

347
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:26,759
itself is a good insect repellent but

348
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,089
when it's hydrogenated it improves the

349
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:32,279
fragrance of the material from loud

350
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:36,089
herbaceous like freshly mowed grass like

351
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:38,700
not very pleasant too lemony minty with

352
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:41,609
a hint of licorice and so the notion is

353
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:45,170
that you know we just took this plant

354
00:17:41,609 --> 00:17:47,599
oil which is rich with unsaturated

355
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:50,430
compounds and did a chemical

356
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:54,779
modification of the plant oil to improve

357
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:57,058
its stability fragrance shelf-life you

358
00:17:54,779 --> 00:17:59,399
know typically hydrogenation issues to

359
00:17:57,058 --> 00:18:01,279
improve shelf-life and everybody always

360
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,840
asked me and they'd say well

361
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:05,639
hydrogenation a vegetable fat that's not

362
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:09,149
good because it makes trans fats and

363
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:11,820
that's true that trans fats are made in

364
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:15,330
that process but when we hydrogenate

365
00:18:11,819 --> 00:18:18,029
extracts were hydrogenating you know

366
00:18:15,329 --> 00:18:21,359
extracts that are highly refined and

367
00:18:18,029 --> 00:18:24,690
either you know crystalline and we did

368
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:28,439
we did hydrogenate some sauces some some

369
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:31,259
sort of terpene rich extracts that would

370
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:33,450
be sort of fall into that sauce category

371
00:18:31,259 --> 00:18:36,269
so there was a lot of terpenes in there

372
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:39,120
and in the hydrogenation process the

373
00:18:36,269 --> 00:18:40,889
terpenes are hydrogenated as well and so

374
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:43,529
each different genetic which has a

375
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:45,870
different you know expression in

376
00:18:43,529 --> 00:18:47,240
different terpene profiles all will have

377
00:18:45,869 --> 00:18:50,729
a different now

378
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:53,519
profile of hydrogenated terpenes and you

379
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:55,170
know we don't even begin to think that

380
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:58,558
we can even begin to understand what

381
00:18:55,170 --> 00:19:01,880
that does or you know we need to explore

382
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:04,769
that thoroughly and find out you know

383
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:07,020
like when you hydrogenate mersin for

384
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:09,569
example you take it down to a fully

385
00:19:07,019 --> 00:19:13,429
saturated hydrocarbon it's now more like

386
00:19:09,569 --> 00:19:15,899
a solvent than fragrant molecule so

387
00:19:13,429 --> 00:19:20,519
understand like the impact that that has

388
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:23,340
on all of the terpenes is is is just a

389
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:27,470
really monumental challenge are there

390
00:19:23,339 --> 00:19:33,269
any ways to accidentally hydrogenate

391
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:34,529
yeah you know the end i asked the

392
00:19:33,269 --> 00:19:38,910
questions i don't know how much that is

393
00:19:34,529 --> 00:19:41,730
public but it seems as if i can of worms

394
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:43,410
there so it turns out we found out and

395
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:45,650
this was again a connection that kevin

396
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:48,259
had made thank you very much Kevin of a

397
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:50,519
group that was hot in Vegas that was

398
00:19:48,259 --> 00:19:52,920
unintentionally hydrogenating some

399
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:55,740
distillate while they were making it and

400
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:57,960
they didn't know it and the chemist who

401
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:58,799
had actually looked at this actually

402
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,509
wasn't a chemist

403
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:03,539
a biologist by training with a really

404
00:20:00,509 --> 00:20:05,670
sharp guy was able to figure it out and

405
00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:07,379
knew about our stuff I think from hashed

406
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:08,910
Church right isn't that right Kevin or

407
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:12,300
he knew about it from UNIX zone yeah

408
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:13,710
yeah yes yeah because he knew about me

409
00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:18,750
because he knew about the patent and he

410
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:20,819
yeah so he and and I don't exactly know

411
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:24,150
like how that whole thing resolved

412
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:26,839
because the group that regulates that

413
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:29,670
market is what the Division of Taxation

414
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:32,939
the city of Las Vegas or something like

415
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:35,850
that and this was brought up at one of

416
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:38,220
the hearings of the thing and I I don't

417
00:20:35,849 --> 00:20:42,079
exactly know what to pay him it was but

418
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:44,160
yeah so so the molecules are prone to

419
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:46,740
hydrogenation if given the right

420
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:49,590
conditions and these people in their

421
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:51,509
distillate process was somehow beating

422
00:20:49,589 --> 00:20:54,359
on the molecule and the right way to add

423
00:20:51,509 --> 00:20:56,519
hydrogen to it so we need to figure out

424
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:58,019
exactly you know get to the bottom of

425
00:20:56,519 --> 00:21:02,879
that and find out you know what's going

426
00:20:58,019 --> 00:21:04,680
on there so do you have to like get the

427
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,020
terpenes out separate you think so that

428
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:08,610
you isolate the noise and only

429
00:21:07,019 --> 00:21:11,789
hydrogenate those and then add the terms

430
00:21:08,609 --> 00:21:14,309
back just to not concern you any because

431
00:21:11,789 --> 00:21:19,740
as you say that's like you hydrogenate

432
00:21:14,309 --> 00:21:24,509
a thing entourage effect that is greatly

433
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:26,789
different yeah i mean i and and again

434
00:21:24,509 --> 00:21:31,470
the chemical modification of what the

435
00:21:26,789 --> 00:21:34,289
plant provides is a different you know

436
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:36,779
thing of doing it to the active

437
00:21:34,289 --> 00:21:39,569
ingredient itself so we didn't you know

438
00:21:36,779 --> 00:21:41,549
most of our focus has been on the active

439
00:21:39,569 --> 00:21:46,279
ingredient itself just to make sure that

440
00:21:41,549 --> 00:21:49,409
we understand you know the the that the

441
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:51,809
structure itself and and so we're

442
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:54,960
collaborating and i think you may have

443
00:21:51,809 --> 00:21:56,609
been useful in helping set this up Kevin

444
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,490
I don't know because it took several

445
00:21:56,609 --> 00:22:03,619
interactions and several phone call but

446
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:05,670
Guillermo Moreno Sands who now is

447
00:22:03,619 --> 00:22:08,279
affiliated with the University over in

448
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:10,529
Spain is actually the one that's going

449
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:11,950
to be doing our CV one binding studies

450
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:13,839
for

451
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:16,058
as it turns out it's so exceedingly

452
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:18,308
difficult to do that in the United

453
00:22:16,058 --> 00:22:22,750
States for all the schedule 1 [ __ ]

454
00:22:18,308 --> 00:22:24,910
reasons but we do have some other

455
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:27,160
interest from the researchers of the

456
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:31,990
temple so I've touched base with Sarah

457
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:35,860
Jane Ward up there who has a mouse test

458
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:39,460
for for pain induced by chemotherapy

459
00:22:35,859 --> 00:22:42,399
that's a very interesting again test for

460
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:46,569
cannabinoids and it's really important

461
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:50,110
too for us to get it into this ALS Mouse

462
00:22:46,569 --> 00:22:52,509
test that that Mary Abood has up in

463
00:22:50,109 --> 00:22:54,849
Temple and again there's just stupid

464
00:22:52,509 --> 00:22:56,980
regulations that keeps things from

465
00:22:54,849 --> 00:23:00,129
happening and keeps us from being able

466
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:01,990
to have access to these researchers who

467
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:05,770
are actually paid with government

468
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:08,440
funding my tax dollars which go to these

469
00:23:05,769 --> 00:23:11,410
government agencies which give funding

470
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:14,590
to professors that have assays from my

471
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:17,500
compound that I can't test because of

472
00:23:14,589 --> 00:23:19,269
some government [ __ ] or just totally

473
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:23,319
sucks but anyway I don't know how I've

474
00:23:19,269 --> 00:23:26,139
diverted that yet so you know the

475
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:28,299
important thing is that we're focusing

476
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:30,400
on the active ingredient itself and we

477
00:23:28,299 --> 00:23:33,099
want to make direct comparisons with

478
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:36,040
what the hydrogenation does to the

479
00:23:33,099 --> 00:23:38,529
cannabinoids and what it does compared

480
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:40,539
to their non hydrogenated counterparts

481
00:23:38,529 --> 00:23:44,079
and see if we can understand again from

482
00:23:40,539 --> 00:23:49,420
a molecular point of view once we look

483
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:52,389
at the binding and see does it gain from

484
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:54,940
having this hydrogenation a perhaps

485
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:57,700
again a different metabolic faith that

486
00:23:54,940 --> 00:24:00,549
these cannabinoids may have might change

487
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:03,308
their pharmacokinetic profile which

488
00:24:00,549 --> 00:24:06,308
really impacts on how effective they are

489
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:10,420
and their duration of activity once

490
00:24:06,308 --> 00:24:14,049
they're administered to humans going

491
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:17,800
deep the mo that's intense but

492
00:24:14,049 --> 00:24:20,019
definitely also making sense what Kevin

493
00:24:17,799 --> 00:24:22,119
said in regards to potentially doing the

494
00:24:20,019 --> 00:24:23,558
cannabinoids and reintroducing the

495
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:24,309
terpenes especially if you're turning

496
00:24:23,558 --> 00:24:26,889
the terpene

497
00:24:24,309 --> 00:24:29,889
like full blown solvents in the case of

498
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:32,259
Mersin yeah well in the case of like

499
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:34,420
bata carry awfully so beta carry

500
00:24:32,259 --> 00:24:36,839
ethylene as it turns out is a component

501
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:39,060
in catenin oil and so when we

502
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:42,039
hydrogenated in Katamon oil we also

503
00:24:39,059 --> 00:24:43,599
hydrogenated beta carry awfully and and

504
00:24:42,039 --> 00:24:46,240
it turns it into something called carry

505
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:50,230
off Elaine and humanely nin to huemul

506
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,680
ain so these are these are known you

507
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:54,640
know

508
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:58,210
compounds you know yeah and and III

509
00:24:54,640 --> 00:25:01,110
guess again yeah when you take what you

510
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:04,210
know nature provides in the botanical

511
00:25:01,109 --> 00:25:06,459
mixture within the plant and now you're

512
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:08,950
doing a chemical modification to that

513
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:11,620
plant and you're modifying everything in

514
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:16,059
the plant yeah you're rolling the dice

515
00:25:11,619 --> 00:25:19,899
on say a negative type of of synergistic

516
00:25:16,059 --> 00:25:21,940
or entourage or ensemble effect right

517
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:24,070
where things could basically synergize

518
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:27,490
in a negative way so we need to totally

519
00:25:24,069 --> 00:25:29,859
understand you know with the impact that

520
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:32,440
that has and the safety and ultimately

521
00:25:29,859 --> 00:25:35,679
like how that really you know does

522
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:39,340
improve or does not improve the activity

523
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:41,170
of these compounds and someone was

524
00:25:39,339 --> 00:25:45,009
asking in regards to something about

525
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:48,220
delta 8 being produced is that happening

526
00:25:45,009 --> 00:25:52,720
in the hydrogenation yeah well what we

527
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:55,600
found is that very very sporadically

528
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:58,210
this was just a test that we had not

529
00:25:55,599 --> 00:26:01,149
really run before but we when we had

530
00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:03,279
first on a hydrogenation we let it go

531
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:05,769
overnight Marcus we're we're shaking the

532
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:08,639
hydrogenation overnight and when we

533
00:26:05,769 --> 00:26:14,769
worked it up the next day we had about a

534
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:18,400
22% mixture of the delta ii acid in

535
00:26:14,769 --> 00:26:21,639
there which nobody had actually or netic

536
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:23,259
i turns out machine had characterized it

537
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:26,580
once before so i have to correct myself

538
00:26:23,259 --> 00:26:29,259
there's a there's a one paper and it's

539
00:26:26,579 --> 00:26:31,929
was presented to me when I was at the

540
00:26:29,259 --> 00:26:34,779
ACS meeting in in New Orleans last month

541
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:36,830
or a couple months ago where yeah delta

542
00:26:34,779 --> 00:26:38,509
8 acid was once before

543
00:26:36,829 --> 00:26:42,230
reported in the literature but it's very

544
00:26:38,509 --> 00:26:44,960
very extremely rare and so Delta 8 acid

545
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:47,298
is actually made by the isomerization of

546
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:50,778
the Delta 9 acid which is made in the

547
00:26:47,298 --> 00:26:53,119
plant Delta 8 and it's just very rare to

548
00:26:50,778 --> 00:26:57,319
observe that and so we observe that and

549
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:59,089
characterize it by HPLC mass spect so

550
00:26:57,319 --> 00:27:03,408
that was a cool that was a paper that I

551
00:26:59,089 --> 00:27:06,109
gave at the New Orleans ACS meeting but

552
00:27:03,409 --> 00:27:08,240
yeah you could hydrogenate Delta 8 I

553
00:27:06,109 --> 00:27:12,740
mean it doesn't matter where the double

554
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:16,250
bond is and what's even more exciting to

555
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:19,460
talk about THC isomers are isomers for a

556
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:24,138
second is that there seems to be a

557
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:27,798
preponderance of thinking that in a lot

558
00:27:24,138 --> 00:27:32,089
of people's distillate that the Delta 10

559
00:27:27,798 --> 00:27:35,569
isomer is showing up and Delta 10 we

560
00:27:32,089 --> 00:27:38,269
could easily envision just being an

561
00:27:35,569 --> 00:27:41,629
isomerization of the double bond into

562
00:27:38,269 --> 00:27:43,490
conjugation with the aromatic ring which

563
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:44,899
is basically going to introduce a little

564
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:48,138
bit of ring strain because it's a

565
00:27:44,898 --> 00:27:50,209
tricyclic system but you gain a little

566
00:27:48,138 --> 00:27:52,099
bit of energy because you're dropping

567
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:55,399
that double bond now in the conjugation

568
00:27:52,099 --> 00:27:57,798
well the other thing is that that proton

569
00:27:55,398 --> 00:28:00,678
the benzylic proton there is highly

570
00:27:57,798 --> 00:28:03,200
resolvable in the proton NMR and what

571
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:06,649
that means is that if we are forming

572
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:09,319
Delta 10 that we'll be able to totally

573
00:28:06,648 --> 00:28:13,428
see the disappearance of that proton in

574
00:28:09,319 --> 00:28:16,158
the NMR so right now a fellow by name is

575
00:28:13,429 --> 00:28:18,710
Zac Jordan but I think as a hash Church

576
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:22,210
watcher he's a moderator of a couple

577
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:24,829
different Facebook pages around

578
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:26,600
distillation I think he sells equipment

579
00:28:24,829 --> 00:28:28,699
and builds rooms and stuff like that

580
00:28:26,599 --> 00:28:31,250
family Zac Jordan is actually going to

581
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:35,389
be providing a sample to the group over

582
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:37,038
and for columns to run a NMR of that and

583
00:28:35,388 --> 00:28:39,888
we'll be able to see again try to

584
00:28:37,038 --> 00:28:41,750
characterize whether or not this Delta

585
00:28:39,888 --> 00:28:44,569
10 isomer a lot of people are

586
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:48,869
characterizing it as CBG just because

587
00:28:44,569 --> 00:28:52,069
that's where CB g runs in the HPLC

588
00:28:48,869 --> 00:28:56,879
or not even CVG but it's like CB GA and

589
00:28:52,069 --> 00:28:59,159
it totally can't be CVG a because it's

590
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,330
in distillate there's no a and

591
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:03,480
distillate right everything's

592
00:29:00,329 --> 00:29:05,519
decarboxylated so people just don't know

593
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:07,799
what it is it's the span and peak that's

594
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:10,379
in a lot of people's distillate there's

595
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:13,919
a lot of us who think that it's probably

596
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:18,450
Delta ten it'll be great to not only

597
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:21,180
identify it as Delta ten THC but then a

598
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:22,590
potential financial opportunity for

599
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:26,670
whoever could come up with the right

600
00:29:22,589 --> 00:29:28,829
process to make standards of Delta ten

601
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:32,009
because those standards good for a lot

602
00:29:28,829 --> 00:29:33,899
of money and that to be sold at the DEA

603
00:29:32,009 --> 00:29:35,519
dilution and all that kind of [ __ ] and I

604
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:38,130
think you even need a schedule and

605
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:41,639
license to produce those if I remember

606
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:43,890
correctly but um it's just you know

607
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:45,660
again another isomer that's in

608
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:53,759
distillate that's been mischaracterized

609
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:54,900
for years and we think that the last

610
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:56,879
thing I just wanted to say about

611
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:59,490
cannabinoids you know because we're

612
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,080
starting to get testing results that are

613
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:02,910
grouped down in Maryland is you know a

614
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:08,429
lot of people are testing for the propyl

615
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:11,460
cannabinoids you know CBD V and and THC

616
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:17,789
v but they're not testing for the

617
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:23,160
corresponding acid so THC V a and CBD v

618
00:30:17,789 --> 00:30:26,450
a so I'd be interested if anyone knows

619
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:30,360
about whether or not those are being

620
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:34,019
tested for or in other places or anyone

621
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:36,179
knows about origins of standards you has

622
00:30:34,019 --> 00:30:38,129
it I think that is one of the thing that

623
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:40,470
steep hill will get back to me and say

624
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:42,420
well we can only test for them if we

625
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:44,549
have standards available so it's kind of

626
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:46,800
chicken or the I you really need the

627
00:30:44,549 --> 00:30:49,619
standards in order to basically be able

628
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:52,319
to identify them for sure in the

629
00:30:49,619 --> 00:30:54,269
chromatogram and then be able to do you

630
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:56,339
know a suitable in the fly and

631
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:58,849
concentration dilution curve to make

632
00:30:56,339 --> 00:31:01,789
sure that your response factor

633
00:30:58,849 --> 00:31:04,909
between peak height or whatever you're

634
00:31:01,789 --> 00:31:06,619
measuring is linear with with

635
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:08,750
concentration there's that right so you

636
00:31:06,619 --> 00:31:11,359
want to do a couple series of tenfold

637
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:13,519
delusions do those injections in your

638
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:16,219
HPLC make sure you get a beautiful

639
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:17,750
linear correlation and then you know

640
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:20,089
that you can basically make those

641
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:22,490
assignments and maybe again this is

642
00:31:20,089 --> 00:31:25,129
again tightening up part of the

643
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:28,430
uncertainty of when you do you know

644
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:30,650
cannabinoid analysis of concentrates and

645
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:34,910
extracts and you only get like numbers

646
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:36,470
have that up to you know 85 or 90

647
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:39,710
percent what the hell's the rest of it

648
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:41,900
you know you want that acid right

649
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:44,840
because you should be able to use the

650
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:47,180
acid forms as a QC of anyways is do you

651
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:52,240
see the same acid to decarboxylation

652
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:55,670
ratio and the purple verse the pencil

653
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:57,079
molecules right and any sort of extracts

654
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:58,820
and you should sort of seed I know they

655
00:31:57,079 --> 00:32:02,599
differentially decarboxylate to some

656
00:31:58,819 --> 00:32:04,879
degree but you see analysis Kevin of an

657
00:32:02,599 --> 00:32:06,439
extract that was taken at very low

658
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,840
temperature there's no reason to believe

659
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:12,309
you have in fact we don't we see very

660
00:32:08,839 --> 00:32:14,899
little you know decarboxylation so

661
00:32:12,309 --> 00:32:17,029
wondering if anybody else had known

662
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:20,540
about whether or not people are testing

663
00:32:17,029 --> 00:32:25,490
for the acids of the propyl cannabinoids

664
00:32:20,539 --> 00:32:27,710
that's the real question if anyone knows

665
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:29,059
it yeah I don't know if hand I'll look

666
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:31,400
into the folks that I know but it would

667
00:32:29,059 --> 00:32:32,569
certainly be helpful to get an L CMS on

668
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,160
there or just so you're not it

669
00:32:32,569 --> 00:32:37,609
questioning whether you don't have a

670
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:40,580
standard you know needle oh yeah wahhhh

671
00:32:37,609 --> 00:32:42,439
meaning again wanted it this speaks to

672
00:32:40,579 --> 00:32:44,329
again being able to hijack these

673
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:46,670
pathways and put them in the yeast and

674
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:49,939
be able to get yeast to express

675
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:52,880
cannabinoids expressly for making the

676
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:54,769
analytical standards so now there's no

677
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,690
you know uncertainty about making you

678
00:32:54,769 --> 00:32:58,819
know whatever whatever whatever that

679
00:32:56,690 --> 00:33:00,769
yeast is only spitting out that molecule

680
00:32:58,819 --> 00:33:03,859
I mean this is why again modern

681
00:33:00,769 --> 00:33:05,809
techniques and biotechnology can be used

682
00:33:03,859 --> 00:33:09,319
utilize and harness than the industry

683
00:33:05,809 --> 00:33:11,690
for these types of reasons you see any

684
00:33:09,319 --> 00:33:12,710
microbial hydrogenation that could be at

685
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:14,210
play or is that most

686
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:16,940
they mostly had draughts innate stuff on

687
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:20,710
that the tails yeah my actually the

688
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:24,409
Walmart of microbial degradation is

689
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:27,500
oxidation right I mean so typically like

690
00:33:24,409 --> 00:33:30,289
when you look at those compounds that L

691
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:33,288
solely had claimed as you know new

692
00:33:30,288 --> 00:33:35,179
cannabinoids they were new cannabinoids

693
00:33:33,288 --> 00:33:39,919
they were the existing cannabinoids that

694
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:42,740
were chewed on by bacteria and other

695
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:45,500
bugs to basically hydroxylate um's so

696
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:47,298
bugs like the hydroxylated stuff because

697
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:49,759
they're turning stuff into food

698
00:33:47,298 --> 00:33:52,548
ultimately trying to mineralize the

699
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:54,950
carbon into co2 but you know you're

700
00:33:52,548 --> 00:33:57,408
you're basically you know sue Damona

701
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:59,419
bacterias and all these other bacterias

702
00:33:57,409 --> 00:34:02,899
and all these other fungi basically

703
00:33:59,419 --> 00:34:05,659
start hydroxylated the [ __ ] out of stuff

704
00:34:02,898 --> 00:34:08,388
and I mean that's how the degradation of

705
00:34:05,659 --> 00:34:10,309
wood and wood pulp and and and cellulose

706
00:34:08,389 --> 00:34:11,750
them if you bury paper in the soil and

707
00:34:10,309 --> 00:34:12,409
you come back a couple of weeks later

708
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:15,820
it's gone

709
00:34:12,409 --> 00:34:20,088
right that's because these you know

710
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:22,760
bacteria basically just D polymerize

711
00:34:20,088 --> 00:34:25,009
cellulose by Fenton chemistry which is

712
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:26,810
single electron chemistry that you know

713
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:28,790
you could certainly intervene in but

714
00:34:26,809 --> 00:34:36,019
yeah I mean there's a lot of chemistry

715
00:34:28,789 --> 00:34:37,460
that's going on and so uh well I don't

716
00:34:36,019 --> 00:34:43,128
even know if that was the answer to that

717
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:45,168
question no I think you did I I've seen

718
00:34:43,128 --> 00:34:46,989
the similar papers on on hydroxylation

719
00:34:45,168 --> 00:34:49,699
as well and that's different than what

720
00:34:46,989 --> 00:34:51,489
you're doing yeah I mean typically yeah

721
00:34:49,699 --> 00:34:56,088
I mean if you think about again

722
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:57,858
bacterial yeah and just even oxidation

723
00:34:56,088 --> 00:35:00,880
and the liver and most like what's going

724
00:34:57,858 --> 00:35:03,650
on and that's again where where perhaps

725
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:06,559
hydrogenation could help because the

726
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:09,950
sites typically if both metabolic and

727
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:12,259
thermo oxidative degradation are in the

728
00:35:09,949 --> 00:35:15,710
proximity of where those double bonds

729
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:18,830
and those degrees of unsaturation are so

730
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:21,559
perhaps again just perhaps the metabolic

731
00:35:18,829 --> 00:35:25,219
fate of these molecules will influence

732
00:35:21,559 --> 00:35:26,340
their pharmacokinetics enough to perhaps

733
00:35:25,219 --> 00:35:29,909
lower their

734
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:32,970
to those that's just a hypothesis right

735
00:35:29,909 --> 00:35:35,940
now but a testable one that's some

736
00:35:32,969 --> 00:35:38,429
high-caliber scientific talk for 9:30

737
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:39,119
a.m. in the morning here on the west

738
00:35:38,429 --> 00:35:42,059
coast

739
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:45,329
welcome to Wade laughter in the room

740
00:35:42,059 --> 00:35:47,279
that was heavy ha wait Marcus yes I was

741
00:35:45,329 --> 00:35:51,119
I was just about to speak up and say

742
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:53,670
that I have gratitude for the people who

743
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:55,559
are willing to do the deep work on what

744
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:59,940
all's going on with our various

745
00:35:55,559 --> 00:36:04,320
processes I wanted to thank Kevin for

746
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:07,889
posting a link to our no has a camps

747
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:13,880
paper on various extraction techniques I

748
00:36:07,889 --> 00:36:16,289
was really struck by he was doing naptha

749
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:17,730
ethanol I don't remember all of the

750
00:36:16,289 --> 00:36:22,199
reagents but the one that stuck out to

751
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:24,599
me was olive oil as a solvent for and

752
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:27,089
doing a water and oil extraction of

753
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:29,069
plant material and getting really good

754
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:32,789
results on keeping the terpenes and a

755
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:35,100
full range of commitment IDEs and you

756
00:36:32,789 --> 00:36:37,009
guys said like as you said Marcus it's

757
00:36:35,099 --> 00:36:39,779
Sunday morning on the west coast and

758
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:43,140
that was really deep conversation for

759
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:47,220
Sunday morning for me but but I was

760
00:36:43,139 --> 00:36:50,150
really struck by wood wood this what the

761
00:36:47,219 --> 00:36:54,359
science guys mark or Kevin or you Marcus

762
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:57,300
talk about what's what's going on with

763
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:59,250
olive oil I know the challenge for the

764
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:01,830
work that I do is concentrating it's

765
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:04,289
getting enough cannabinoids into a olive

766
00:37:01,829 --> 00:37:05,929
oil extractions to be meaningful for

767
00:37:04,289 --> 00:37:10,259
some of the folks we're trying to help

768
00:37:05,929 --> 00:37:12,839
but I was really struck by the the

769
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:14,640
results I saw in that paper suggested

770
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:17,100
that there was really good extraction

771
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:20,129
and that's something people can do in

772
00:37:17,099 --> 00:37:21,509
their kitchen at home and grow their own

773
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:23,280
medicine and this is a thing that's

774
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:25,440
really important from my point of view

775
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:27,600
is that we all should have access to

776
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:30,630
this plant in whatever form we'll want

777
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:33,329
to use it it's not a harmful thing for

778
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:36,539
anybody you can abuse it and overuse it

779
00:37:33,329 --> 00:37:38,009
but like I said the the way mark and

780
00:37:36,539 --> 00:37:40,199
Kevin and so many other people are

781
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:42,869
really digging at the science

782
00:37:40,199 --> 00:37:49,289
what's going on with cannabis and humans

783
00:37:42,869 --> 00:37:50,940
and animals I really want people as much

784
00:37:49,289 --> 00:37:53,099
as possible to be able to make this

785
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:55,470
medicine for themselves to be able to

786
00:37:53,099 --> 00:37:57,619
concentrate it into a form that's useful

787
00:37:55,469 --> 00:38:01,078
for their bodies or their families and

788
00:37:57,619 --> 00:38:02,730
you guys know so much about all the

789
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:04,530
different ways this plant gets played

790
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:06,088
with and I know there's people who are

791
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:07,829
listening that probably know more about

792
00:38:06,088 --> 00:38:09,719
this than me but like I said it I was

793
00:38:07,829 --> 00:38:12,950
really struck by that paper so I wanted

794
00:38:09,719 --> 00:38:15,750
to thank you Kevin for posting it and

795
00:38:12,949 --> 00:38:18,269
now I'm going to shush and let some

796
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:21,239
other folks talk because like I said to

797
00:38:18,269 --> 00:38:24,088
me the real key here is normalizing

798
00:38:21,239 --> 00:38:26,608
cannabis helping people understand that

799
00:38:24,088 --> 00:38:28,679
it's not just about how high can you get

800
00:38:26,608 --> 00:38:31,259
which is a beautiful side effect that I

801
00:38:28,679 --> 00:38:36,419
personally love very much but it's also

802
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:39,690
really is a healing plant and making it

803
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:42,000
available to people is a game-changing

804
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:46,099
thing on so many levels

805
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:48,599
ok bye I'm gonna sit here listen now

806
00:38:46,099 --> 00:38:50,280
well glad you came in and shared over

807
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:52,109
this way to hope your back is doing

808
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:53,010
better what about you Johnny B what do

809
00:38:52,108 --> 00:38:54,298
you what are you sitting at you're

810
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:59,160
sitting there in the grow room puffing

811
00:38:54,298 --> 00:39:07,889
on hash yeah just it's being done for a

812
00:38:59,159 --> 00:39:09,509
few months cleaning up perfect buds on

813
00:39:07,889 --> 00:39:11,730
the you know I got some buds here that I

814
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:15,240
need to sift and make some rosin with I

815
00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:17,760
got I got some chocolate which is just

816
00:39:15,239 --> 00:39:22,739
really beautiful quality on that I got a

817
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:25,349
little bit of cookies that I'm Boveda

818
00:39:22,739 --> 00:39:28,828
packing as you can see and then I have

819
00:39:25,349 --> 00:39:33,119
still like a hundred grams of where is

820
00:39:28,829 --> 00:39:35,519
my bike which I'm using your med booster

821
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:38,640
packs there that you gave me so getting

822
00:39:35,519 --> 00:39:40,679
it all ready for actually squishing the

823
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:42,838
the chocolate ice and dry I'm gonna sift

824
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:46,259
that and maybe make some bubble out of

825
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:47,578
that but I'm gonna squish the rest here

826
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:51,210
in the next little bit I got all sorts

827
00:39:47,579 --> 00:39:52,630
of good flavors and it was the idea to

828
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:54,039
test with

829
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:57,250
those humidity packs brought it down to

830
00:39:54,039 --> 00:39:58,389
like 33% for system I don't know if that

831
00:39:57,250 --> 00:40:01,389
was too much because I had a lot of

832
00:39:58,389 --> 00:40:03,099
plant material yeah yeah dry dry I you

833
00:40:01,389 --> 00:40:05,219
know what I'll never forget skunk man

834
00:40:03,099 --> 00:40:09,819
telling me years ago it's not a misnomer

835
00:40:05,219 --> 00:40:11,889
to dry sift it's not a misnomer to dry

836
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:14,620
sift and getting the heads to actually

837
00:40:11,889 --> 00:40:16,679
go from this big you know perfect water

838
00:40:14,619 --> 00:40:21,609
balloon down to a shriveled up grape

839
00:40:16,679 --> 00:40:26,199
they just seem to to be more readily

840
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:28,480
available to to first extract gently but

841
00:40:26,199 --> 00:40:31,119
also to clean as well depending on what

842
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:34,300
methods you're using to clean I know

843
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:36,549
first squishin 62% seems to be the magic

844
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:38,590
number but I mean for sifting I'm always

845
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:40,600
kind of to grow you know I bring my room

846
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:43,660
down to 42 percent when I'm doing the

847
00:40:40,599 --> 00:40:45,880
first bouncing that seems mean I like 40

848
00:40:43,659 --> 00:40:48,849
to 420 of course so that seems to be my

849
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:50,890
magic number but I mean Sam and some

850
00:40:48,849 --> 00:40:52,989
other people out there mean awesome

851
00:40:50,889 --> 00:40:55,000
humidity levels wrong when we are

852
00:40:52,989 --> 00:40:57,489
sifting you mean we get I tried even in

853
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,929
the freezer too much mom those are the

854
00:40:57,489 --> 00:41:03,000
very beginning you're teaching me and

855
00:40:58,929 --> 00:41:03,000
stuff like that so it's going back to

856
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:08,350
did you get your things figured out

857
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:12,700
there Sam thank you so do you hear me oh

858
00:41:08,349 --> 00:41:15,039
you sound perfect okay well then I guess

859
00:41:12,699 --> 00:41:17,769
I got it fixed I don't know what the

860
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:20,170
problem was I don't care well we can't

861
00:41:17,769 --> 00:41:23,409
see you anymore but we can hear you too

862
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:25,720
near perfection so that's that's because

863
00:41:23,409 --> 00:41:29,199
what I've done is I turned my mic off I

864
00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:33,639
turned everything else off and facing

865
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:36,759
the computer and I felt uncomfortable so

866
00:41:33,639 --> 00:41:42,519
I put a beach tape over it you pull it a

867
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:45,490
Mark Zuckerberg I did have a question

868
00:41:42,519 --> 00:41:56,079
for did mark leave the room

869
00:41:45,489 --> 00:41:59,859
mark there's an acid in April fraction

870
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:02,429
then you're creating four isomers

871
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:02,430
correct

872
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:10,099
say that again oh okay so you you

873
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:12,950
hydrogenate an acid form of a

874
00:42:10,099 --> 00:42:16,039
cannabinoids or neutral form or both of

875
00:42:12,949 --> 00:42:18,949
them together whatever but then for

876
00:42:16,039 --> 00:42:25,190
different isomers are created by that

877
00:42:18,949 --> 00:42:30,699
process correct okay so the reduction of

878
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:35,150
the acid group happens in a different

879
00:42:30,699 --> 00:42:37,579
hydrogenation process with a different

880
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:40,430
different Attalus but yes I mean if

881
00:42:37,579 --> 00:42:44,630
you're making a mixture and you have

882
00:42:40,429 --> 00:42:49,219
both hydroxymethyl and that the acid

883
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:52,730
form would be for four different

884
00:42:49,219 --> 00:42:55,369
compounds because every time you do a

885
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:57,139
hydrogenation you're gonna make a little

886
00:42:55,369 --> 00:42:58,549
bit of the methyl going up and you're

887
00:42:57,139 --> 00:43:01,029
gonna make a little bit of the methyl

888
00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:04,250
going down and because you already

889
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:06,670
established stereochemistry I have

890
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:10,219
multiple centers within that molecule

891
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:12,400
those compounds are different compounds

892
00:43:10,219 --> 00:43:15,319
and are resolvable what are called

893
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:19,099
diastereomers that we could actually see

894
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:21,470
different peaks on in the in both the

895
00:43:19,099 --> 00:43:25,190
NMR and in the HPLC

896
00:43:21,469 --> 00:43:29,269
right now when i hydrogenate crystalline

897
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:32,659
pure Delta 9 THC a that it is just

898
00:43:29,269 --> 00:43:35,449
absolutely pristine pure crystalline

899
00:43:32,659 --> 00:43:38,599
very very clean this is from Chris at

900
00:43:35,449 --> 00:43:40,909
the clear when we hydrogenate that we

901
00:43:38,599 --> 00:43:45,529
see just about a one-to-one mixture of

902
00:43:40,909 --> 00:43:47,359
each of the diastereomers of h8c a so

903
00:43:45,530 --> 00:43:50,990
that's what the methyl going up and the

904
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:52,610
methyl going down and Marcus I'm looking

905
00:43:50,989 --> 00:43:54,879
in the in the chat here you had said

906
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:59,300
something that Toni nag asked about a

907
00:43:54,880 --> 00:44:03,380
delta 9 being a red color Delta G Delta

908
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:05,960
10 or delta 10 I'm sorry let me comment

909
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:08,990
on the red color for a second so a few

910
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:13,940
people have identified this in

911
00:44:08,989 --> 00:44:15,619
distillate and the the red may or may

912
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:18,200
not be too

913
00:44:15,619 --> 00:44:20,179
a trace amount of a flavonoid that's in

914
00:44:18,199 --> 00:44:23,929
there that's very highly prone to either

915
00:44:20,179 --> 00:44:26,750
being very yellow or very red but I

916
00:44:23,929 --> 00:44:28,399
think that in some of the CBD stuff that

917
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:33,769
I'm seeing where I'm seeing sort of like

918
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:38,510
a ruby red or more like a a it's a less

919
00:44:33,769 --> 00:44:40,579
amber red but more of like a more of

920
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:42,860
like a fuchsia red like almost like a

921
00:44:40,579 --> 00:44:46,400
ruby red is the best way that I would

922
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:50,750
describe it I believe that that impurity

923
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:53,210
is the the hydroxy quinone which is a

924
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:57,079
known compound if you look in machines

925
00:44:53,210 --> 00:45:01,340
paper just Google CBD chemical aspects

926
00:44:57,079 --> 00:45:05,779
you'll see a reference to paper where he

927
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:09,860
sees oxidation products of CBD forming

928
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:13,490
these highly conjugated material called

929
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:15,650
quinone ins which are usually red in

930
00:45:13,489 --> 00:45:18,739
color and in fact I think the ruby red

931
00:45:15,650 --> 00:45:21,470
color is that hydroxy quinone that's

932
00:45:18,739 --> 00:45:24,169
part of the what's called the bean test

933
00:45:21,469 --> 00:45:28,549
there's a bean test that's used to

934
00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:32,030
differentiate CBD from THC where one of

935
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:35,030
the components turns red I think the

936
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:38,120
other component turns blue if it's DN C

937
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:41,300
it turns red if it's CBD that red color

938
00:45:38,119 --> 00:45:43,730
that you're making is that hydroxy by

939
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:45,890
now so that may or may not be the color

940
00:45:43,730 --> 00:45:48,559
tawny neg that you're that you're

941
00:45:45,889 --> 00:45:51,139
referring to I'm not sure what the color

942
00:45:48,559 --> 00:45:53,869
of delta10 is but I can tell you I just

943
00:45:51,139 --> 00:45:56,389
got a text from Zach Jordan last night

944
00:45:53,869 --> 00:45:59,150
on this the material that he sent me was

945
00:45:56,389 --> 00:46:01,639
pretty clear or let me just say it's

946
00:45:59,150 --> 00:46:03,260
off-white so it look pretty pure or

947
00:46:01,639 --> 00:46:05,480
whatever it is and you know we'll have

948
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:08,510
an NMR of it hopefully pretty soon and

949
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:11,119
when we have the results we'll we'll

950
00:46:08,510 --> 00:46:13,550
share it here but I think about the ten

951
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:15,319
is definitely a culprit a phantom peak

952
00:46:13,550 --> 00:46:18,650
and a lot of people's distillate these

953
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:22,039
days so hopefully the part you were

954
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:24,680
naturally dealt to eight do you find out

955
00:46:22,039 --> 00:46:27,289
to eight in herbal cannabis or is it

956
00:46:24,679 --> 00:46:28,268
strictly an artifact of lab work you

957
00:46:27,289 --> 00:46:31,088
know just

958
00:46:28,268 --> 00:46:35,228
Delta Aidid I think is formed on the the

959
00:46:31,088 --> 00:46:42,518
processing of Delta nine yeah so Delta

960
00:46:35,228 --> 00:46:47,468
eight is is favored by so it did the mmm

961
00:46:42,518 --> 00:46:52,358
two calculations on the entire tricyclic

962
00:46:47,469 --> 00:46:54,309
structure - the c5 tail and anybody

963
00:46:52,358 --> 00:46:57,668
knows anything about molecular modeling

964
00:46:54,309 --> 00:47:01,028
it would have taken in a much longer

965
00:46:57,668 --> 00:47:03,398
time to solve the structures because of

966
00:47:01,028 --> 00:47:06,818
the infinite number of different

967
00:47:03,398 --> 00:47:10,118
populations that that c5 alkyl tail is

968
00:47:06,818 --> 00:47:12,338
so we chopped off that alkyl tail and we

969
00:47:10,119 --> 00:47:16,199
modeled the Delta eight versus Delta

970
00:47:12,338 --> 00:47:18,278
nine thermodynamics and so ground state

971
00:47:16,199 --> 00:47:21,068
calculations show that Delta aides

972
00:47:18,278 --> 00:47:23,889
favored by a little over a kcal so if

973
00:47:21,068 --> 00:47:28,088
given the opportunity that double bond

974
00:47:23,889 --> 00:47:30,579
will walk over from Delta nine to Delta

975
00:47:28,088 --> 00:47:33,369
eight and that can be favored by heat it

976
00:47:30,579 --> 00:47:35,528
can be favored by acid most particularly

977
00:47:33,369 --> 00:47:39,219
acids so again if you look at that if

978
00:47:35,528 --> 00:47:44,768
that that machine paper where they talk

979
00:47:39,219 --> 00:47:47,979
about the cyclization of CBD to make th

980
00:47:44,768 --> 00:47:51,518
see that it goes to delta nine when they

981
00:47:47,978 --> 00:47:55,028
use a non product lewis acid like boron

982
00:47:51,518 --> 00:47:57,038
trifluoride which again promotes a

983
00:47:55,028 --> 00:47:59,469
different type of carbonium ion based

984
00:47:57,039 --> 00:48:02,859
mechanism to close the ring to make THC

985
00:47:59,469 --> 00:48:06,429
and their delta nine is favored however

986
00:48:02,858 --> 00:48:09,848
if you use protic acid like sulphuric or

987
00:48:06,429 --> 00:48:12,068
or you know more common you know acids

988
00:48:09,849 --> 00:48:15,309
methane sulphonic and stuff like that

989
00:48:12,068 --> 00:48:20,139
those are gonna basically favor the

990
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:23,009
generation because because delta eight

991
00:48:20,139 --> 00:48:25,778
is favored if given the opportunity to

992
00:48:23,009 --> 00:48:28,389
isomerize from delta nine to delta eight

993
00:48:25,778 --> 00:48:33,418
okay so to round this up and be clear

994
00:48:28,389 --> 00:48:33,419
this is not happening in a living plant

995
00:48:38,349 --> 00:48:43,659
in a living planet yeah you're doing it

996
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:47,409
in a lab or it's logical pH won't do

997
00:48:43,659 --> 00:48:51,009
this alone yeah this this is happening

998
00:48:47,409 --> 00:48:53,409
on the processing yes yes I don't

999
00:48:51,010 --> 00:48:58,330
believe Delta 8 is naturally occurring

1000
00:48:53,409 --> 00:49:00,429
in Delta 9 you know Kersey is not

1001
00:48:58,329 --> 00:49:03,130
naturally occurring either but it's an

1002
00:49:00,429 --> 00:49:05,589
important cannabinoid yeah so Delta 9

1003
00:49:03,130 --> 00:49:07,780
acid is what occurs in the plant and the

1004
00:49:05,590 --> 00:49:10,300
two things that are unstable about it is

1005
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:12,490
the carboxylic acid so we all know

1006
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:14,890
that's prone to penalty constellation

1007
00:49:12,489 --> 00:49:18,129
but also the double bond is prone to

1008
00:49:14,889 --> 00:49:20,819
isomerization from Delta 8 if given the

1009
00:49:18,130 --> 00:49:24,220
opportunity we'll isomerize to Delta 9

1010
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:27,420
but you know these are things that yes

1011
00:49:24,219 --> 00:49:30,819
don't happen in the plant they happen on

1012
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:33,309
you know human processing right work if

1013
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:36,940
you've lived at hydrogen's funny can you

1014
00:49:33,309 --> 00:49:42,340
I'd read yeah yeah we did hydrogenated

1015
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:46,000
CBD Kevin had better efficacy in in our

1016
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:49,019
mouse data with with glioblastoma and

1017
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:53,769
you know again given the legal landscape

1018
00:49:49,019 --> 00:49:56,679
hydrogenated CBD is certainly a a sort

1019
00:49:53,769 --> 00:49:58,750
of direct to market you know you know

1020
00:49:56,679 --> 00:50:00,969
from so something that's probably gonna

1021
00:49:58,750 --> 00:50:05,920
be a lot easier to deal with in terms of

1022
00:50:00,969 --> 00:50:07,750
regulatory and whatnot but yeah I mean

1023
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:10,030
that all these compounds that have

1024
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:11,909
double bonds and we'll all hydrogenate

1025
00:50:10,030 --> 00:50:14,170
and maybe the idea is to lightly

1026
00:50:11,909 --> 00:50:16,420
hydrogenate but then recombine those

1027
00:50:14,170 --> 00:50:18,490
with other things you know so it's just

1028
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:21,250
a chemical refinement step that can be

1029
00:50:18,489 --> 00:50:23,469
applied along the way and perhaps you're

1030
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:27,159
right the ultimate thing is to take the

1031
00:50:23,469 --> 00:50:31,029
cannabinoid out hydrogenated re-add the

1032
00:50:27,159 --> 00:50:32,739
terpenes and basically function like

1033
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:34,720
that yeah there's there's a second

1034
00:50:32,739 --> 00:50:38,739
double bond hanging off the CBD

1035
00:50:34,719 --> 00:50:41,079
does that get agitated yeah so if you go

1036
00:50:38,739 --> 00:50:43,779
to the Michele and paper the journal of

1037
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:46,269
medicinal chemistry from 2006 you'll

1038
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:52,590
find out that they actually did the

1039
00:50:46,269 --> 00:50:55,989
hydrogenation of CBD to make both the

1040
00:50:52,590 --> 00:50:58,240
this hydrogenated material and the mono

1041
00:50:55,989 --> 00:51:00,399
hydrogenated material which you can just

1042
00:50:58,239 --> 00:51:02,229
get away by using something like

1043
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:05,320
wilkinson's catalyst which will

1044
00:51:02,230 --> 00:51:07,030
selectively just hydrogenate one of the

1045
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:09,789
double bonds that's a platinum based

1046
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:13,000
catalyst that uses or I'm sorry

1047
00:51:09,789 --> 00:51:14,259
ruthenium ah yeah they could use it

1048
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,179
ruthenium but I think they used a

1049
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:18,420
platinum based catalyst but there are

1050
00:51:16,179 --> 00:51:21,159
ways to sort of chemo selectively

1051
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:24,400
hydrogenate one double bond or the other

1052
00:51:21,159 --> 00:51:26,559
so yeah mushy lumps group had looked at

1053
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:28,150
this back in 2006 they published the

1054
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:30,159
results in the journal medicinal

1055
00:51:28,150 --> 00:51:34,240
chemistry however you'll notice that

1056
00:51:30,159 --> 00:51:38,829
they did not hydrogenate CBD a right

1057
00:51:34,239 --> 00:51:41,019
they hydrogenated CBD so you know our

1058
00:51:38,829 --> 00:51:42,730
concept is to basically take what the

1059
00:51:41,019 --> 00:51:45,280
plant is providing which are the

1060
00:51:42,730 --> 00:51:47,679
cannabinoid acids and hydrogenate those

1061
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:51,910
which ultimately will be used to deliver

1062
00:51:47,679 --> 00:51:54,250
the hydrogenated cannabinoids but the

1063
00:51:51,909 --> 00:51:56,199
key is basically had that intellectual

1064
00:51:54,250 --> 00:52:00,429
property that's the bridge between what

1065
00:51:56,199 --> 00:52:03,099
the plant makes and and the hydrogenated

1066
00:52:00,429 --> 00:52:04,989
actors right I think Sam's question

1067
00:52:03,099 --> 00:52:07,389
earlier was about that ol methyl group

1068
00:52:04,989 --> 00:52:09,429
you are speaking about does that when

1069
00:52:07,389 --> 00:52:11,859
you do the hydrogenation do you get no

1070
00:52:09,429 --> 00:52:18,250
methyl group on the carboxylic acid but

1071
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:20,530
met just separated janessa oh the ol

1072
00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:22,809
methyl group on the car yes so we don't

1073
00:52:20,530 --> 00:52:24,970
so you mean like an ester like a own

1074
00:52:22,809 --> 00:52:26,469
methyl ester that's what I thought you

1075
00:52:24,969 --> 00:52:28,809
mentioned earlier that you had a way of

1076
00:52:26,469 --> 00:52:31,149
putting you know a methyl group yeah you

1077
00:52:28,809 --> 00:52:34,809
know we have a way of basically take the

1078
00:52:31,150 --> 00:52:38,320
acid down to the hydroxymethyl so we

1079
00:52:34,809 --> 00:52:43,000
convert what was a carboxylic acid into

1080
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:45,120
a ch2oh right that's what becomes a new

1081
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:48,670
benzyl alcohol that we could then

1082
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:50,259
decorate stuff on the hydroxyl group and

1083
00:52:48,670 --> 00:52:53,380
again Kevin what I was sort of making a

1084
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:56,320
connection to is who knows how much more

1085
00:52:53,380 --> 00:53:00,250
that high area of the hydrophobic cleft

1086
00:52:56,320 --> 00:53:02,410
of the active site can we tolerate well

1087
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:05,679
let's start loading it up with methyl

1088
00:53:02,409 --> 00:53:07,719
ethyl isopropyl butyl ba-ba-ba to start

1089
00:53:05,679 --> 00:53:11,108
putting all kinds of groups out there

1090
00:53:07,719 --> 00:53:14,858
and see if we can interpolate farther

1091
00:53:11,108 --> 00:53:16,869
into the active site of the cb1 receptor

1092
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:19,358
we just don't know how much more steric

1093
00:53:16,869 --> 00:53:23,140
baggage that area of the receptor can

1094
00:53:19,358 --> 00:53:24,489
accommodate how promiscuous it is got a

1095
00:53:23,139 --> 00:53:28,150
fluorinated and everyone loves to

1096
00:53:24,489 --> 00:53:29,889
fluorinated yeah well the problem with

1097
00:53:28,150 --> 00:53:32,139
fluorination III here you in

1098
00:53:29,889 --> 00:53:35,259
fluorination is actually a really very

1099
00:53:32,139 --> 00:53:37,269
intriguing opportunity problem with

1100
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:41,319
fluorine is that whenever you put

1101
00:53:37,269 --> 00:53:42,849
fluorine baited to a hydrogen you're

1102
00:53:41,318 --> 00:53:48,099
setting yourself up for the elimination

1103
00:53:42,849 --> 00:53:52,900
of of HF and HF for those of us who

1104
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:55,028
watch you know Breaking Bad is what you

1105
00:53:52,900 --> 00:54:01,358
know they dissolve the bathtub with okay

1106
00:53:55,028 --> 00:54:03,400
that's nasty [ __ ] okay yeah you don't

1107
00:54:01,358 --> 00:54:05,318
want to be messing with HF fluorinated

1108
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:07,028
stuff there was some talk about this and

1109
00:54:05,318 --> 00:54:09,639
I know that Missoula made some

1110
00:54:07,028 --> 00:54:11,619
fluorinated derivatives and Florian's a

1111
00:54:09,639 --> 00:54:13,328
very very interesting molecule because

1112
00:54:11,619 --> 00:54:15,789
it's it's very polar but it's

1113
00:54:13,329 --> 00:54:18,880
hydrophobic it's just it's very very

1114
00:54:15,789 --> 00:54:21,099
peculiar and the issue with

1115
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:23,289
perfluorinated materials things like

1116
00:54:21,099 --> 00:54:27,028
teflon and other things like that is

1117
00:54:23,289 --> 00:54:31,329
there are no natural metabolic processes

1118
00:54:27,028 --> 00:54:33,670
to degrade the carbon fluorine bond so

1119
00:54:31,329 --> 00:54:35,890
that makes these materials persistent in

1120
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:39,519
nature meaning that they're gonna be

1121
00:54:35,889 --> 00:54:41,440
around forever so geologically you know

1122
00:54:39,519 --> 00:54:45,719
a million years from now we will be

1123
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:48,970
known as the Teflon era because it's all

1124
00:54:45,719 --> 00:54:52,750
Teflon Fukushima Erik is that's all

1125
00:54:48,969 --> 00:54:54,608
that's gonna remain from our era the in

1126
00:54:52,750 --> 00:54:57,219
stone right because all the floor

1127
00:54:54,608 --> 00:55:01,119
chemicals that we released and obviously

1128
00:54:57,219 --> 00:55:03,969
for Kashima and any other nuclear

1129
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:08,190
catastrophe waiting to happen this makes

1130
00:55:03,969 --> 00:55:08,189
me want to be like a disease you know

1131
00:55:10,170 --> 00:55:16,349
something I've been dealing with in my

1132
00:55:12,278 --> 00:55:19,170
life I'm gonna get personal for a second

1133
00:55:16,349 --> 00:55:23,719
I hurt my back earlier this year had

1134
00:55:19,170 --> 00:55:28,019
back surgery eight weeks ago today and I

1135
00:55:23,719 --> 00:55:31,019
have realized that just because I can do

1136
00:55:28,019 --> 00:55:35,429
things doesn't mean I always should and

1137
00:55:31,019 --> 00:55:37,739
I really wonder about the in this

1138
00:55:35,429 --> 00:55:42,539
conversation for example the idea of

1139
00:55:37,739 --> 00:55:45,509
using fluorine to alter cannabinoid

1140
00:55:42,539 --> 00:55:48,989
structure in something that humans might

1141
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:52,500
consume at some point it feels very

1142
00:55:48,989 --> 00:55:57,359
strongly to me like this is something we

1143
00:55:52,500 --> 00:56:01,429
can do but should we be doing it and it

1144
00:55:57,360 --> 00:56:05,340
feels to me like the chemical industry

1145
00:56:01,429 --> 00:56:07,589
is doing a long-term ongoing experiment

1146
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:08,070
on the planet and all the organisms that

1147
00:56:07,590 --> 00:56:16,260
are on it

1148
00:56:08,070 --> 00:56:19,670
and I I I want to go religious for a

1149
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:24,210
second this is church after all nature

1150
00:56:19,670 --> 00:56:29,099
can provide I think most of the things

1151
00:56:24,210 --> 00:56:33,210
that we need from this planet we're just

1152
00:56:29,099 --> 00:56:36,000
getting greedy about how about all the

1153
00:56:33,210 --> 00:56:38,970
things we can do again coming back to

1154
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:43,800
there's things that I can do with my

1155
00:56:38,969 --> 00:56:45,929
back being hurt that my physical

1156
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:48,360
therapists and whatnot tell me no no you

1157
00:56:45,929 --> 00:56:51,690
should really just chill it's time to be

1158
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:54,720
patient with your body and I think in

1159
00:56:51,690 --> 00:56:56,760
cannabis science I want to ask those of

1160
00:56:54,719 --> 00:56:57,929
you who are doing research on these kind

1161
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:59,400
of things the things that were

1162
00:56:57,929 --> 00:57:01,769
discussing this morning like I said I

1163
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:04,559
I'm fascinated by the science of

1164
00:57:01,769 --> 00:57:06,690
cannabis I don't understand that much

1165
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:10,309
about the plant but I've really been

1166
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:13,710
struck at the healing potential in it I

1167
00:57:10,309 --> 00:57:16,369
know so many folks who have seen benefit

1168
00:57:13,710 --> 00:57:19,710
in their own lives from this plant and

1169
00:57:16,369 --> 00:57:21,750
most all of those people got a version

1170
00:57:19,710 --> 00:57:26,000
of the plant pretty close to how it

1171
00:57:21,750 --> 00:57:29,070
comes out of the ground usually dried

1172
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,530
for quite a while it's been extractions

1173
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:35,950
with

1174
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:37,690
butters or olive oil or ethanol did some

1175
00:57:35,949 --> 00:57:40,149
period of time working with medicine

1176
00:57:37,690 --> 00:57:41,980
makers who using hexane because the

1177
00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:43,690
research that I have done suggested that

1178
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:45,550
if you made sure all the hexane was out

1179
00:57:43,690 --> 00:57:47,500
it was a really good way of preserving

1180
00:57:45,550 --> 00:57:53,320
cannabinoids and terpenoids

1181
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:55,929
like you would find in the plant and one

1182
00:57:53,320 --> 00:58:00,280
of the beauties of this gathering that

1183
00:57:55,929 --> 00:58:02,440
you created here Marcus is there's all

1184
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:05,620
different ways of looking at and working

1185
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:08,789
with this plant being expressed here and

1186
00:58:05,619 --> 00:58:11,319
the science of it is something that I

1187
00:58:08,789 --> 00:58:13,170
really love like I've said a couple of

1188
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:16,510
times already

1189
00:58:13,170 --> 00:58:20,369
but I have to come back to again just

1190
00:58:16,510 --> 00:58:22,360
because we can should we I really

1191
00:58:20,369 --> 00:58:25,329
especially when you start talking about

1192
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:28,360
medicine and at least part of hash

1193
00:58:25,329 --> 00:58:31,210
search is for me how to how to work with

1194
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:33,130
this plant and concentrate it in ways

1195
00:58:31,210 --> 00:58:36,909
that are beneficial both for your

1196
00:58:33,130 --> 00:58:38,769
headspace and the lovely vibe like it's

1197
00:58:36,909 --> 00:58:40,750
been said here before it's okay to feel

1198
00:58:38,769 --> 00:58:42,610
good it's alright to feel good

1199
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:44,349
that's a beautiful healing aspect of

1200
00:58:42,610 --> 00:58:48,400
this plant but there's so many other

1201
00:58:44,349 --> 00:58:50,409
things it can do for us and Sam has

1202
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:52,119
really shown over the years that there's

1203
00:58:50,409 --> 00:58:54,399
all kinds of different ways to get

1204
00:58:52,119 --> 00:58:57,159
different cannabinoids from this plant

1205
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:59,349
it's incredibly plastic we don't really

1206
00:58:57,159 --> 00:59:01,690
have to create new plastics or new

1207
00:58:59,349 --> 00:59:04,539
chemical compounds that don't exist in

1208
00:59:01,690 --> 00:59:08,530
nature as a result of our playing with

1209
00:59:04,539 --> 00:59:11,110
the plant because we can again there's

1210
00:59:08,530 --> 00:59:14,950
that thing just because we can well I

1211
00:59:11,110 --> 00:59:18,610
get nervous I think mostly but they're

1212
00:59:14,949 --> 00:59:20,549
using these chlorinated or friend lated

1213
00:59:18,610 --> 00:59:23,110
or whatever they're doing to it

1214
00:59:20,550 --> 00:59:24,970
cannabinoids I think there isn't for

1215
00:59:23,110 --> 00:59:27,130
research more than they're actually

1216
00:59:24,969 --> 00:59:31,059
trying to make medicines for human

1217
00:59:27,130 --> 00:59:34,269
beings and a research if that allows you

1218
00:59:31,059 --> 00:59:38,500
to understand the mechanism of control

1219
00:59:34,269 --> 00:59:41,650
of the cannabinoids over receptor

1220
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:43,179
systems etc etc I think that's a very

1221
00:59:41,650 --> 00:59:44,858
beneficial thing

1222
00:59:43,179 --> 00:59:48,009
and without science we wouldn't know

1223
00:59:44,858 --> 00:59:51,338
what THC is we wouldn't so I mean I'm

1224
00:59:48,010 --> 00:59:53,770
absolutely in favor of science but yeah

1225
00:59:51,338 --> 00:59:56,349
we don't want anything it's gonna harm

1226
00:59:53,769 --> 00:59:58,719
anybody and if we can make it naturally

1227
00:59:56,349 --> 01:00:01,088
from a plant of course that makes a

1228
00:59:58,719 --> 01:00:05,169
little bit more common sense it's gonna

1229
01:00:01,088 --> 01:00:07,599
be cheaper - yeah I'd weigh in there as

1230
01:00:05,170 --> 01:00:11,050
well that uh I think some of this desire

1231
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:14,970
to make non natural compounds really is

1232
01:00:11,050 --> 01:00:18,190
rooted back in our intellectual prop

1233
01:00:14,969 --> 01:00:20,558
you can get monopolies if you change it

1234
01:00:18,190 --> 01:00:22,659
whereas if it's natural it's very hard

1235
01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:26,380
for you to get these these patents on

1236
01:00:22,659 --> 01:00:28,058
things and so there's a desire for

1237
01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:31,480
people to make Rabanne event to bring

1238
01:00:28,059 --> 01:00:33,250
out the tea he want disaster which

1239
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:34,568
everyone warned them about you don't

1240
01:00:33,250 --> 01:00:35,858
want to you don't want to hit that thing

1241
01:00:34,568 --> 01:00:37,568
and turn it off you're gonna depress

1242
01:00:35,858 --> 01:00:40,838
people and lo and behold he gets we get

1243
01:00:37,568 --> 01:00:42,639
suicides but that was that temptation I

1244
01:00:40,838 --> 01:00:46,509
think was there because they could get

1245
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:48,519
IPP on a molecule from motivating

1246
01:00:46,510 --> 01:00:51,250
society to mess with something that's

1247
01:00:48,519 --> 01:00:53,349
been working for millennia and modify it

1248
01:00:51,250 --> 01:00:55,809
with a very small amount of data on

1249
01:00:53,349 --> 01:00:57,548
toxicity and on how this works in the

1250
01:00:55,809 --> 01:01:01,240
general population and we step in that

1251
01:00:57,548 --> 01:01:02,739
trap I think all time go the road not

1252
01:01:01,239 --> 01:01:05,439
that we shouldn't pursue it to Sam's

1253
01:01:02,739 --> 01:01:08,318
point I think I I do think I do not view

1254
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:10,358
humankind as outside of nature I view

1255
01:01:08,318 --> 01:01:12,250
our minds of what we create is very

1256
01:01:10,358 --> 01:01:13,869
similar to you know the intelligence

1257
01:01:12,250 --> 01:01:18,309
that these have building beehives had

1258
01:01:13,869 --> 01:01:20,740
been beaver making we also are sentient

1259
01:01:18,309 --> 01:01:22,180
enough to question longevity perhaps a

1260
01:01:20,739 --> 01:01:24,129
bit more than these other organisms and

1261
01:01:22,179 --> 01:01:26,048
then if since we're gifted with that

1262
01:01:24,130 --> 01:01:30,579
perhaps we should honor it a little bit

1263
01:01:26,048 --> 01:01:33,599
more hey I wanted to welcome Mike West

1264
01:01:30,579 --> 01:01:35,859
to the room how's it going Mike

1265
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:44,349
we'll know if you're froze up or if

1266
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:45,969
you're still there but welcome I guess

1267
01:01:44,349 --> 01:01:48,250
he froze up

1268
01:01:45,969 --> 01:01:51,189
that's interesting to hear both sides of

1269
01:01:48,250 --> 01:01:53,230
the of the story I'm kind of I find it

1270
01:01:51,190 --> 01:01:55,269
fascinating as well the science the you

1271
01:01:53,230 --> 01:01:57,940
know from Sam's perspective if it's for

1272
01:01:55,269 --> 01:02:00,400
a research you know it's kind of it's

1273
01:01:57,940 --> 01:02:02,409
it's obviously a beneficial thing but at

1274
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:04,150
the same time I see Wade's perspective

1275
01:02:02,409 --> 01:02:05,618
as well it's always interesting to see

1276
01:02:04,150 --> 01:02:07,480
where you're coming from this and that's

1277
01:02:05,619 --> 01:02:09,039
why I always enjoy having Wade and

1278
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:11,559
Forrest on because they're really coming

1279
01:02:09,039 --> 01:02:13,960
from this perspective of like helping

1280
01:02:11,559 --> 01:02:15,969
like very sick you know children in

1281
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:18,010
particular and so when you're helping

1282
01:02:15,969 --> 01:02:20,919
sick children your perspective is going

1283
01:02:18,010 --> 01:02:23,950
to be very unique and and very sort of

1284
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:25,539
focused on that on that concept of like

1285
01:02:23,949 --> 01:02:28,769
hey we got to be really careful what we

1286
01:02:25,539 --> 01:02:31,739
give these you know delicate susceptible

1287
01:02:28,769 --> 01:02:34,449
children that are very very you know

1288
01:02:31,739 --> 01:02:36,129
sensitive to anything that could be in

1289
01:02:34,449 --> 01:02:38,618
the plant that that maybe doesn't

1290
01:02:36,130 --> 01:02:41,530
necessarily need to be there at the same

1291
01:02:38,619 --> 01:02:43,750
time who's to say what incredible

1292
01:02:41,530 --> 01:02:46,300
discoveries may occur in some of the

1293
01:02:43,750 --> 01:02:49,989
work that guys like dr. Marc are doing

1294
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:51,789
in regards to helping mankind and and

1295
01:02:49,989 --> 01:02:53,769
and helping us with our health and

1296
01:02:51,789 --> 01:02:55,210
helping unlock the endocannabinoid

1297
01:02:53,769 --> 01:02:57,099
system and getting a deeper

1298
01:02:55,210 --> 01:03:00,159
understanding on how it works and all of

1299
01:02:57,099 --> 01:03:01,720
these complex compounds it's extremely

1300
01:03:00,159 --> 01:03:03,969
interesting I can't believe that was

1301
01:03:01,719 --> 01:03:05,980
like an hour solid of like intense

1302
01:03:03,969 --> 01:03:09,429
science talk oh there you are Mike

1303
01:03:05,980 --> 01:03:11,920
you're back I see you moving now you

1304
01:03:09,429 --> 01:03:13,509
shocked me how long your hair and beard

1305
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:15,940
are cuz I just picture you as this

1306
01:03:13,510 --> 01:03:18,339
clean-cut guy and it's like oh [ __ ]

1307
01:03:15,940 --> 01:03:20,740
Mike's been in the cave building extract

1308
01:03:18,338 --> 01:03:29,460
facilities for the last couple of years

1309
01:03:20,739 --> 01:03:32,409
very cool dude can't hear you but oh I

1310
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:35,050
always type in I guess his mics not

1311
01:03:32,409 --> 01:03:37,588
working oh he's got a bad connection

1312
01:03:35,050 --> 01:03:40,720
he's gonna come right back no problem

1313
01:03:37,588 --> 01:03:42,639
make it back yeah so just to comment for

1314
01:03:40,719 --> 01:03:46,088
a second Marcus on the patent and all

1315
01:03:42,639 --> 01:03:49,029
that finds a new thing is that the only

1316
01:03:46,088 --> 01:03:52,900
way to really take these through you

1317
01:03:49,030 --> 01:03:55,210
know FDA sanction clinical trials is to

1318
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:57,639
really have a good strong proprietary

1319
01:03:55,210 --> 01:03:59,710
position on the other side of those

1320
01:03:57,639 --> 01:04:03,309
trials and I'll be it

1321
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:06,880
very historic what GW is doing with

1322
01:04:03,309 --> 01:04:09,429
epidural ax which is basically CBD and

1323
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:13,720
sativex which is a one-to-one CBD THC

1324
01:04:09,429 --> 01:04:15,368
for epilepsy and multiple sclerosis on

1325
01:04:13,719 --> 01:04:17,529
the other side of those clinical trials

1326
01:04:15,369 --> 01:04:20,588
which is going to teach the world what

1327
01:04:17,530 --> 01:04:23,680
we already know which is that cannabis

1328
01:04:20,588 --> 01:04:26,549
in these formulations to a statistically

1329
01:04:23,679 --> 01:04:30,579
significant portion of the population

1330
01:04:26,550 --> 01:04:34,210
that has these diseases can be effective

1331
01:04:30,579 --> 01:04:38,259
at controlling these symptoms GW will

1332
01:04:34,210 --> 01:04:41,889
have to rely on their everything but the

1333
01:04:38,260 --> 01:04:45,160
active ingredient patent a state to

1334
01:04:41,889 --> 01:04:48,039
enforce you know their patent will they

1335
01:04:45,159 --> 01:04:51,519
will that be able to impact the CBD

1336
01:04:48,039 --> 01:04:55,480
industry I mean it's the sort of 100

1337
01:04:51,519 --> 01:04:59,469
pound gorilla in the room is that they

1338
01:04:55,480 --> 01:05:02,949
are taking epidural X through Food and

1339
01:04:59,469 --> 01:05:05,919
Drug Administration approved trial and

1340
01:05:02,949 --> 01:05:09,189
spending a lot of money doing it so the

1341
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:13,510
company that does that with our compound

1342
01:05:09,190 --> 01:05:15,970
will actually own the clinical trial

1343
01:05:13,510 --> 01:05:18,880
results and then again really come up

1344
01:05:15,969 --> 01:05:21,399
with formulated medicine the way that

1345
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:23,680
the pharmaceutical companies can accept

1346
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:27,579
it which is by food and drug trials

1347
01:05:23,679 --> 01:05:30,159
phase you know new drug application and

1348
01:05:27,579 --> 01:05:33,190
approval of a new drug active ingredient

1349
01:05:30,159 --> 01:05:34,960
a variety of different formulations so I

1350
01:05:33,190 --> 01:05:39,358
I think that hhcl

1351
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:43,240
again look about it is both a R&amp;D tool

1352
01:05:39,358 --> 01:05:46,299
to assess stereochemical promiscuity

1353
01:05:43,239 --> 01:05:49,689
within the active site of cb1 receptor

1354
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:52,359
but also a potential probe or

1355
01:05:49,690 --> 01:05:57,369
therapeutic in and of itself that might

1356
01:05:52,358 --> 01:06:03,969
have enhanced therapeutic potential for

1357
01:05:57,369 --> 01:06:06,309
very very sick patients yeah and my

1358
01:06:03,969 --> 01:06:07,779
comments there on IP we're not only

1359
01:06:06,309 --> 01:06:10,449
aimed at you mark it's more just the

1360
01:06:07,780 --> 01:06:14,290
that's border

1361
01:06:10,449 --> 01:06:16,210
since my investment because there's such

1362
01:06:14,289 --> 01:06:17,739
substantial cost getting things through

1363
01:06:16,210 --> 01:06:19,510
the FDA by the time you're done you're

1364
01:06:17,739 --> 01:06:22,000
bankrupt if you don't have a patent to

1365
01:06:19,510 --> 01:06:23,589
protect what you've built so well I'm

1366
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:28,269
not here to blame the players it's more

1367
01:06:23,588 --> 01:06:29,858
than game that's interesting to cover

1368
01:06:28,269 --> 01:06:31,809
both sides of the conversation either

1369
01:06:29,858 --> 01:06:33,250
way I like that we can do that here in

1370
01:06:31,809 --> 01:06:37,000
hash Church without getting into

1371
01:06:33,250 --> 01:06:39,960
full-blown assaulting arguments it's

1372
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,960
nice to have different perspectives

1373
01:06:42,449 --> 01:06:48,189
cannabis is the bridge cannabis is the

1374
01:06:46,119 --> 01:06:49,570
bridge that being said I definitely for

1375
01:06:48,190 --> 01:06:51,220
the first time really got a better

1376
01:06:49,570 --> 01:06:52,780
understanding in regards to what you're

1377
01:06:51,219 --> 01:06:54,279
doing with the hydrogenation I don't

1378
01:06:52,780 --> 01:06:56,260
know if I just wasn't listening before

1379
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:58,869
paying too much attention to moderating

1380
01:06:56,260 --> 01:07:03,400
but thank you for sharing that dr. mark

1381
01:06:58,869 --> 01:07:05,140
that was it's you know a lot of people

1382
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:06,820
ask me you know all the time you know

1383
01:07:05,139 --> 01:07:10,420
about it and people are concerned about

1384
01:07:06,820 --> 01:07:12,460
when they hear about hydrogenated oils

1385
01:07:10,420 --> 01:07:14,230
and they know that that generates trans

1386
01:07:12,460 --> 01:07:16,720
fats and so right away the knee-jerk

1387
01:07:14,230 --> 01:07:19,260
reaction is that oh my god you're

1388
01:07:16,719 --> 01:07:22,000
generating trans fats it's like a

1389
01:07:19,260 --> 01:07:24,640
finding oil is very different than

1390
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:26,920
cannabis extract and you wouldn't dab

1391
01:07:24,639 --> 01:07:29,078
cooking oil and to kind of talk about

1392
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:32,289
with what wade was referring to with

1393
01:07:29,079 --> 01:07:37,210
olive oil extracts yeah olive oil is a

1394
01:07:32,289 --> 01:07:39,219
great wonderful hydrophobic vehicle for

1395
01:07:37,210 --> 01:07:40,329
the delivery of cannabis oil into a

1396
01:07:39,219 --> 01:07:43,779
variety of different product

1397
01:07:40,329 --> 01:07:46,240
formulations unfortunately like some

1398
01:07:43,780 --> 01:07:48,010
extracts that we like to dab I mean once

1399
01:07:46,239 --> 01:07:50,229
they're in olive oil and forget about it

1400
01:07:48,010 --> 01:07:52,990
you can't tab that now because you have

1401
01:07:50,230 --> 01:07:55,510
a high molecular weight triglyceride oil

1402
01:07:52,989 --> 01:07:58,239
so it could be formulated into a variety

1403
01:07:55,510 --> 01:08:01,690
of different product formula other than

1404
01:07:58,239 --> 01:08:05,709
something that you can dab but um I'll

1405
01:08:01,690 --> 01:08:08,730
go back to again like having a variety I

1406
01:08:05,710 --> 01:08:11,050
like Marcus the way you say what is it

1407
01:08:08,730 --> 01:08:13,679
the quiver right the arrows in your

1408
01:08:11,050 --> 01:08:18,159
quiver and each one of these extraction

1409
01:08:13,679 --> 01:08:22,778
methods whether it's ice water or butane

1410
01:08:18,159 --> 01:08:24,250
or liquid nitrogen or oh my gosh I mean

1411
01:08:22,779 --> 01:08:28,180
there's so many different ways

1412
01:08:24,250 --> 01:08:30,430
of removing trichomes and trico medicine

1413
01:08:28,180 --> 01:08:32,020
from the plant that all these just

1414
01:08:30,430 --> 01:08:34,480
represent a different way of extracting

1415
01:08:32,020 --> 01:08:37,180
that you can have different products

1416
01:08:34,479 --> 01:08:39,879
that have different terpene profiles or

1417
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:41,680
different modes of action or like you

1418
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:43,720
were saying like with the olive oil I

1419
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:45,759
mean it's always great to whenever you

1420
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:48,190
make rosin chips or you don't know if

1421
01:08:45,759 --> 01:08:50,588
you got leaving anything in your in your

1422
01:08:48,189 --> 01:08:51,909
in your on and chips he'll just soak

1423
01:08:50,588 --> 01:08:54,369
them in olive oil so it could be a

1424
01:08:51,909 --> 01:08:56,019
little coconut oil make some medicated

1425
01:08:54,369 --> 01:08:58,778
oil next time you fry up some bacon

1426
01:08:56,020 --> 01:09:01,359
don't just throw away that bacon fat use

1427
01:08:58,779 --> 01:09:03,520
it to basically you know medicate it so

1428
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:05,890
I mean there's lots of different fad

1429
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:09,430
vehicles and ways that you can extract

1430
01:09:05,890 --> 01:09:12,369
and I try to you know tend to stay away

1431
01:09:09,430 --> 01:09:14,680
from isopropanol that's one solvent i

1432
01:09:12,369 --> 01:09:18,778
don't like but everything else is

1433
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:22,750
opening game i have about four pounds of

1434
01:09:18,779 --> 01:09:24,759
solvent lists basically screams herb

1435
01:09:22,750 --> 01:09:26,380
that I've pressed already that still has

1436
01:09:24,759 --> 01:09:28,960
you know you can see tiny little bit of

1437
01:09:26,380 --> 01:09:32,140
yeah so really easy with those mark this

1438
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:34,029
will get flat fat extracted yeah yeah so

1439
01:09:32,140 --> 01:09:36,430
you throw that isn't like a big tub or

1440
01:09:34,029 --> 01:09:40,259
something like that throw a bunch of oil

1441
01:09:36,430 --> 01:09:44,020
in there or like yeah yeah yeah exactly

1442
01:09:40,259 --> 01:09:46,210
do sound like a single cook yeah I mean

1443
01:09:44,020 --> 01:09:49,470
even like a process like that which

1444
01:09:46,210 --> 01:09:52,779
doesn't even have to be very you know

1445
01:09:49,470 --> 01:09:55,000
high-tech at all it could be almost just

1446
01:09:52,779 --> 01:09:58,270
like a Rick Simpson you know how about

1447
01:09:55,000 --> 01:10:03,279
savory since crock a lot yeah exactly

1448
01:09:58,270 --> 01:10:05,020
exact a big crock pot yeah yeah yeah you

1449
01:10:03,279 --> 01:10:06,550
could do a load Epicure extraction you

1450
01:10:05,020 --> 01:10:09,520
don't even need to really heat it up as

1451
01:10:06,550 --> 01:10:11,260
long no it's super low yeah as long as

1452
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:13,540
you know you're clearing out everything

1453
01:10:11,260 --> 01:10:15,220
and why not grab all that stuff right

1454
01:10:13,539 --> 01:10:17,619
why would you throw that stuff I mean

1455
01:10:15,220 --> 01:10:20,530
unless your ego is so big that you think

1456
01:10:17,619 --> 01:10:22,029
you're so efficient and pressing and for

1457
01:10:20,529 --> 01:10:23,889
me it's I feel like I'm getting the

1458
01:10:22,029 --> 01:10:26,139
majority of what's there just based on

1459
01:10:23,890 --> 01:10:29,289
the results like where is my bike I got

1460
01:10:26,140 --> 01:10:32,230
28% returned the highest I've seen it go

1461
01:10:29,289 --> 01:10:34,449
is 30 so maybe there's 2% left that's

1462
01:10:32,229 --> 01:10:36,669
enough for me to go back and extract

1463
01:10:34,449 --> 01:10:37,840
that out I mean also another thing with

1464
01:10:36,670 --> 01:10:39,699
rosin you can

1465
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:41,110
be very efficient in your extraction

1466
01:10:39,698 --> 01:10:43,809
process but you might be very

1467
01:10:41,109 --> 01:10:48,429
inefficient on how you remove the actual

1468
01:10:43,810 --> 01:10:50,110
screen bag from the squished paper so a

1469
01:10:48,429 --> 01:10:52,300
lot of people and I see it all the time

1470
01:10:50,109 --> 01:10:53,859
they go to grab that bag and they rub it

1471
01:10:52,300 --> 01:10:55,239
through the rosin and they the whole

1472
01:10:53,859 --> 01:10:57,519
edge of the bag

1473
01:10:55,238 --> 01:10:59,468
just grabs a chunk of rosin and you know

1474
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:00,580
in one squish that's not a big deal but

1475
01:10:59,469 --> 01:11:03,939
if you're doing fifty to a hundred

1476
01:11:00,579 --> 01:11:05,920
squishes a day and each bag is 35 grams

1477
01:11:03,939 --> 01:11:08,259
and you're leaving behind several

1478
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:10,690
percent it ends up being substantial and

1479
01:11:08,260 --> 01:11:12,219
that's not even a large commercial you

1480
01:11:10,689 --> 01:11:14,348
know production if you were doing like

1481
01:11:12,219 --> 01:11:16,840
500 to a thousand a day

1482
01:11:14,349 --> 01:11:19,060
imagine how much resin that ends up

1483
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:20,980
being for someone that even if you just

1484
01:11:19,060 --> 01:11:22,659
did it as a philanthropy project and

1485
01:11:20,979 --> 01:11:24,939
said you know what we always save the

1486
01:11:22,658 --> 01:11:27,158
rest we do a crockpot extraction and we

1487
01:11:24,939 --> 01:11:28,539
give it away you'd see that that would

1488
01:11:27,158 --> 01:11:31,059
make a big difference in a lot of

1489
01:11:28,539 --> 01:11:34,810
people's lives whether it was monetary

1490
01:11:31,060 --> 01:11:38,199
or not remember Marcus said 2,000 years

1491
01:11:34,810 --> 01:11:43,119
ago the Persians were using sesame oil

1492
01:11:38,198 --> 01:11:48,059
to extract cannabis more like a dry set

1493
01:11:43,118 --> 01:11:50,559
the real red farmers hashim incredible

1494
01:11:48,060 --> 01:11:53,139
incredible sorry my mic muted there for

1495
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:54,849
a second that's someone asked me what

1496
01:11:53,139 --> 01:11:56,889
temperature I pressed twenty-eight

1497
01:11:54,849 --> 01:12:00,069
percent out at it'll surprise a lot of

1498
01:11:56,889 --> 01:12:01,630
you it's 220 degrees Fahrenheit a lot of

1499
01:12:00,069 --> 01:12:03,488
people will say that's too hot but I

1500
01:12:01,630 --> 01:12:06,279
will explain to you that the humidity

1501
01:12:03,488 --> 01:12:08,379
level the moisture content of the plant

1502
01:12:06,279 --> 01:12:11,649
has to be high for that to really be

1503
01:12:08,380 --> 01:12:12,849
productive around 60 plus percent like

1504
01:12:11,649 --> 01:12:15,698
what John and I were talking about

1505
01:12:12,849 --> 01:12:18,940
earlier if you go down below that then

1506
01:12:15,698 --> 01:12:20,919
the resin actually gets affected by the

1507
01:12:18,939 --> 01:12:22,839
heat I don't know why it doesn't with

1508
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:25,179
the more moisture it might be why we put

1509
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:27,190
the water in with a coconut oil extract

1510
01:12:25,179 --> 01:12:29,260
that water acts as a buffer and sort of

1511
01:12:27,189 --> 01:12:31,689
keeps the heat from affecting the resin

1512
01:12:29,260 --> 01:12:34,270
and blowing out the terpene profile but

1513
01:12:31,689 --> 01:12:37,059
I can assure you my rosin never tastes

1514
01:12:34,270 --> 01:12:39,400
like burnt popcorn and when I open it up

1515
01:12:37,060 --> 01:12:42,960
for people to smell particularly the

1516
01:12:39,399 --> 01:12:46,149
bike shoutout to the maple butter boys

1517
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:48,368
particularly the where is my bike it's

1518
01:12:46,149 --> 01:12:51,408
constantly every single person says the

1519
01:12:48,368 --> 01:12:54,889
same thing they're like wow it is so

1520
01:12:51,408 --> 01:12:58,399
her penal enriched it just reeks like

1521
01:12:54,889 --> 01:13:01,248
utter dank and it's it's beautiful isn't

1522
01:12:58,399 --> 01:13:05,888
analyzed for marking in terms of like

1523
01:13:01,248 --> 01:13:08,688
cannabinoid content I'd have to get a

1524
01:13:05,889 --> 01:13:10,699
see that if maple butter boys have done

1525
01:13:08,689 --> 01:13:13,400
that I personally haven't done that but

1526
01:13:10,698 --> 01:13:15,529
I don't know what the 30 percent breaks

1527
01:13:13,399 --> 01:13:19,129
down into but I would say that it's

1528
01:13:15,529 --> 01:13:21,889
pretty high in THC and t3

1529
01:13:19,130 --> 01:13:26,418
yeah THC a sorry exactly talking to the

1530
01:13:21,889 --> 01:13:28,849
chemist era but or not I'm just curious

1531
01:13:26,418 --> 01:13:31,609
again it's like walking that fine line

1532
01:13:28,849 --> 01:13:34,130
like you said the burnt popcorn tastes

1533
01:13:31,609 --> 01:13:36,408
like we first said I believe right here

1534
01:13:34,130 --> 01:13:38,779
on hash Church that it's like a steam

1535
01:13:36,408 --> 01:13:41,299
distillation based process by which the

1536
01:13:38,779 --> 01:13:43,300
the water that's inside the plant

1537
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:45,590
material is responsible for basically

1538
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:48,320
pushing everything out and so there's a

1539
01:13:45,590 --> 01:13:49,760
delicate balance of being at just the

1540
01:13:48,319 --> 01:13:51,938
right temperature just to write the

1541
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:54,889
pressure and also just having the right

1542
01:13:51,939 --> 01:14:00,019
balance of oil because I think as you

1543
01:13:54,889 --> 01:14:02,239
know not all strains are are good for

1544
01:14:00,019 --> 01:14:06,110
squeezing I'm still trying to figure

1545
01:14:02,238 --> 01:14:09,288
that one out man Marcus AB you ever

1546
01:14:06,109 --> 01:14:10,038
squeezed bone dry material and got

1547
01:14:09,288 --> 01:14:14,688
high-yield

1548
01:14:10,038 --> 01:14:16,698
I have squished bone dry materials I

1549
01:14:14,689 --> 01:14:18,619
tend to get lower yields and have to go

1550
01:14:16,698 --> 01:14:20,988
in like a second and third time I've

1551
01:14:18,618 --> 01:14:23,179
also done fat plant extractions where

1552
01:14:20,988 --> 01:14:25,339
I've seen higher results from bone dry

1553
01:14:23,179 --> 01:14:28,038
material but what I really see in bone

1554
01:14:25,340 --> 01:14:31,130
dry material is just a deeply affected

1555
01:14:28,038 --> 01:14:34,368
resin when I go to collect it at the end

1556
01:14:31,130 --> 01:14:36,498
it's just like popping and shatter II

1557
01:14:34,368 --> 01:14:39,049
it's like almost impossible to pick up

1558
01:14:36,498 --> 01:14:40,998
on my dabber whereas when I dab in or

1559
01:14:39,050 --> 01:14:43,909
when I press anything or squish anything

1560
01:14:40,998 --> 01:14:46,188
at you know with sixty percent moisture

1561
01:14:43,908 --> 01:14:48,319
content it usually comes out it might

1562
01:14:46,189 --> 01:14:49,939
cake out in butter but it usually comes

1563
01:14:48,319 --> 01:14:52,399
out in a way that I could pick it up

1564
01:14:49,939 --> 01:14:56,119
very easily interesting to measure to

1565
01:14:52,399 --> 01:14:59,299
see if the more poppy ones is your

1566
01:14:56,118 --> 01:15:02,509
column or higher in THC rather than ta

1567
01:14:59,300 --> 01:15:04,940
ta well they're definitely lower in

1568
01:15:02,510 --> 01:15:08,590
Terps that

1569
01:15:04,939 --> 01:15:08,589
that I can say from my own bioassay

1570
01:15:10,180 --> 01:15:14,810
steam and it's actually burned me so

1571
01:15:13,340 --> 01:15:17,810
that's where I've gone different levels

1572
01:15:14,810 --> 01:15:20,030
but you know I found that like you say

1573
01:15:17,810 --> 01:15:22,340
this sixty sixty-two percent works the

1574
01:15:20,029 --> 01:15:24,920
best but at the same time I'm curious

1575
01:15:22,340 --> 01:15:26,989
I've squished really dry material of

1576
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:29,420
thirty three percent all the same

1577
01:15:26,988 --> 01:15:32,329
material all the way up to sixty eight

1578
01:15:29,420 --> 01:15:34,069
percent and if I look back in that video

1579
01:15:32,329 --> 01:15:36,229
I think it was really hard to come off

1580
01:15:34,069 --> 01:15:37,729
the parchment of the lower levels but

1581
01:15:36,229 --> 01:15:38,809
I'll have to double check that I'm kind

1582
01:15:37,729 --> 01:15:40,849
of curious now that you talked about

1583
01:15:38,810 --> 01:15:43,400
that because I did all the different

1584
01:15:40,850 --> 01:15:44,930
community levels with the same canvas I

1585
01:15:43,399 --> 01:15:47,210
can put everything in jars and dry there

1586
01:15:44,930 --> 01:15:50,090
although and then I squished everything

1587
01:15:47,210 --> 01:15:51,319
and yeah I believe it was hard to come

1588
01:15:50,090 --> 01:15:53,659
off the parchment when it was dry

1589
01:15:51,319 --> 01:15:55,609
material just thinking in my brain I

1590
01:15:53,659 --> 01:15:57,050
really appreciate you pointing that out

1591
01:15:55,609 --> 01:15:59,630
I would kind of want to think about that

1592
01:15:57,050 --> 01:16:01,219
I just prefer it last two I don't I

1593
01:15:59,630 --> 01:16:02,480
don't enjoy it as much when the

1594
01:16:01,219 --> 01:16:05,300
materials too dry

1595
01:16:02,479 --> 01:16:07,069
I got some cookies yesterday that I'm

1596
01:16:05,300 --> 01:16:10,039
really excited to squish but I had to

1597
01:16:07,069 --> 01:16:11,899
Bovie to pack this up it was it was much

1598
01:16:10,039 --> 01:16:16,130
drier than I like and I've had it in

1599
01:16:11,899 --> 01:16:19,460
here for about 24 hours or so now and

1600
01:16:16,130 --> 01:16:21,289
I'll probably wait another 15 to 16

1601
01:16:19,460 --> 01:16:24,859
hours before I squish this particular

1602
01:16:21,289 --> 01:16:29,090
bag nice what would happen if you mix

1603
01:16:24,859 --> 01:16:32,509
bugs so you'd put in one dry bud one

1604
01:16:29,090 --> 01:16:35,770
damper bug one dry bud one damper but

1605
01:16:32,510 --> 01:16:38,300
and then squish them together with that

1606
01:16:35,770 --> 01:16:42,440
I'll have you do the experiment I've

1607
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:44,329
never tried that Sam I'm just like I'm

1608
01:16:42,439 --> 01:16:47,089
really hyped on this process having

1609
01:16:44,329 --> 01:16:49,460
moisture in my bud it just seems like it

1610
01:16:47,090 --> 01:16:52,279
makes the most sense you can it really

1611
01:16:49,460 --> 01:16:55,880
flows you know when you lose your

1612
01:16:52,279 --> 01:16:58,819
moisture flow if that's the way you feel

1613
01:16:55,880 --> 01:17:00,770
I bet you you're correct yeah it's just

1614
01:16:58,819 --> 01:17:02,869
based on how I feel exactly it could be

1615
01:17:00,770 --> 01:17:04,670
my ego making a mistake based on things

1616
01:17:02,869 --> 01:17:06,890
that aren't accurate or it could be my

1617
01:17:04,670 --> 01:17:14,929
bio essay based on like I just want the

1618
01:17:06,890 --> 01:17:17,030
tastiest nicest assist and it gives us

1619
01:17:14,929 --> 01:17:17,748
our best then it's easier to clean off

1620
01:17:17,029 --> 01:17:21,378
the partial

1621
01:17:17,748 --> 01:17:23,269
for sure yeah absolutely I'm definitely

1622
01:17:21,378 --> 01:17:25,759
gonna squish a half pound when I'm done

1623
01:17:23,269 --> 01:17:27,829
Church here it's with this new machine I

1624
01:17:25,759 --> 01:17:30,288
got the peer pressure long Peaks it's

1625
01:17:27,828 --> 01:17:32,658
just I can't believe how young yeah just

1626
01:17:30,288 --> 01:17:34,248
the recipes I it's gotta it's you know

1627
01:17:32,658 --> 01:17:36,728
we've come a long way let me tell you

1628
01:17:34,248 --> 01:17:41,448
guys something we've come a long way in

1629
01:17:36,729 --> 01:17:44,749
since since episode 25 of talking about

1630
01:17:41,448 --> 01:17:46,488
rosin the rosin episode sorry I just get

1631
01:17:44,748 --> 01:17:48,139
that on mute there buddy

1632
01:17:46,488 --> 01:17:49,938
the rosin episode where we were

1633
01:17:48,139 --> 01:17:51,199
squishing with hair straighteners and

1634
01:17:49,939 --> 01:17:53,359
talking about all wouldn't it be cool if

1635
01:17:51,198 --> 01:17:56,208
we had a machine wouldn't that be like

1636
01:17:53,359 --> 01:17:58,009
that's a historic episode when I look

1637
01:17:56,208 --> 01:18:00,349
back at it because it was like all the

1638
01:17:58,009 --> 01:18:02,418
things we spoke about in there brought

1639
01:18:00,349 --> 01:18:05,689
us I mean Dean ale right away coming out

1640
01:18:02,418 --> 01:18:08,809
with the the t-shirt press the modified

1641
01:18:05,689 --> 01:18:10,909
t-shirt press with dual heated plates to

1642
01:18:08,809 --> 01:18:13,128
you know a company likes a squash coming

1643
01:18:10,908 --> 01:18:15,438
out these guys have welding capabilities

1644
01:18:13,128 --> 01:18:18,288
they were they were herb you know heady

1645
01:18:15,439 --> 01:18:21,109
herb people busting out this like super

1646
01:18:18,288 --> 01:18:23,478
solid incredible press to you know

1647
01:18:21,109 --> 01:18:25,939
coming to the pure pressure guys which

1648
01:18:23,479 --> 01:18:27,829
were engineers and they were take coming

1649
01:18:25,939 --> 01:18:29,989
at it from an engineering standpoint so

1650
01:18:27,828 --> 01:18:32,268
they're creating you know LED screens

1651
01:18:29,988 --> 01:18:34,938
touchscreen with recipes with all the

1652
01:18:32,269 --> 01:18:36,889
you know all of your variables included

1653
01:18:34,939 --> 01:18:39,889
from what you're squishing flour key for

1654
01:18:36,889 --> 01:18:41,989
bubble the size of the microns bag the

1655
01:18:39,889 --> 01:18:44,509
length and the width of the bag for

1656
01:18:41,988 --> 01:18:46,338
forfeiting on the plates the moisture

1657
01:18:44,509 --> 01:18:48,069
content the heat of each plate the

1658
01:18:46,338 --> 01:18:51,708
pressure that you're using through each

1659
01:18:48,069 --> 01:18:53,809
stage you know the emergency stop button

1660
01:18:51,708 --> 01:18:56,028
and the dual buttons for engaging and

1661
01:18:53,809 --> 01:18:59,569
the toggle switch for increasing the psi

1662
01:18:56,029 --> 01:19:01,519
pressure via incremental PS is whether

1663
01:18:59,569 --> 01:19:03,169
you want five or ten or twenty or a

1664
01:19:01,519 --> 01:19:04,849
hundred and that's that's really

1665
01:19:03,168 --> 01:19:06,198
important for when you're you know for

1666
01:19:04,849 --> 01:19:07,668
those of you that want to know quick

1667
01:19:06,198 --> 01:19:09,438
little rosin lesson here when you're

1668
01:19:07,668 --> 01:19:12,229
squishing flour I use about a hundred

1669
01:19:09,439 --> 01:19:14,779
and forty psi maximum the flour is much

1670
01:19:12,229 --> 01:19:17,149
softer and the bags don't blow out I can

1671
01:19:14,779 --> 01:19:19,339
use my plates sped up a lot more so they

1672
01:19:17,149 --> 01:19:24,199
close pretty fast and I can engage my

1673
01:19:19,338 --> 01:19:27,198
pressure from 20 psi up to 140 PSI very

1674
01:19:24,198 --> 01:19:28,938
very quickly almost instantly this would

1675
01:19:27,198 --> 01:19:31,219
be counterintuitive in the opposite of

1676
01:19:28,939 --> 01:19:31,639
how you would squish hash particularly

1677
01:19:31,219 --> 01:19:34,849
hard

1678
01:19:31,639 --> 01:19:37,010
solid you know quality bubble or dry sip

1679
01:19:34,849 --> 01:19:39,199
that's been cleaned up to a four or a

1680
01:19:37,010 --> 01:19:40,849
five star and what we want is we want

1681
01:19:39,198 --> 01:19:43,129
the plates that come down much smaller

1682
01:19:40,849 --> 01:19:45,050
and we want to we want to use the

1683
01:19:43,130 --> 01:19:47,208
pressure at a much more incremental

1684
01:19:45,050 --> 01:19:49,939
stages rather than blasting it out and I

1685
01:19:47,208 --> 01:19:53,238
would never go 140 psi which is about

1686
01:19:49,939 --> 01:19:55,849
15,000 pounds of pressure I would never

1687
01:19:53,238 --> 01:19:58,819
go 140 psi when I'm squishing hash I

1688
01:19:55,849 --> 01:20:00,769
would do a much lower process for

1689
01:19:58,819 --> 01:20:02,509
squishing the glands now not trying to

1690
01:20:00,769 --> 01:20:04,159
get the glands off of the bud we're

1691
01:20:02,510 --> 01:20:07,369
milking the gland so you want to come

1692
01:20:04,158 --> 01:20:09,978
down really slow do a pre-press let the

1693
01:20:07,368 --> 01:20:12,799
heat sit on that hash so it melts and

1694
01:20:09,979 --> 01:20:16,639
liquefies and then finally increment you

1695
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:18,679
know to maybe upwards of 80 or 70 psi to

1696
01:20:16,639 --> 01:20:21,949
to get your yields and to get a really

1697
01:20:18,679 --> 01:20:23,689
nice quality bubble rosin I remember the

1698
01:20:21,948 --> 01:20:26,299
days we thought that we have heart

1699
01:20:23,689 --> 01:20:36,860
attacks because we're all pressing all

1700
01:20:26,300 --> 01:20:38,479
of us what's that mark rosin arm like

1701
01:20:36,859 --> 01:20:40,908
tennis elbow no I'm telling you I

1702
01:20:38,479 --> 01:20:43,070
invited d4k over and we were like hey

1703
01:20:40,908 --> 01:20:44,359
let's let's press up you know an ounce

1704
01:20:43,069 --> 01:20:45,708
we were like well let's press up an

1705
01:20:44,359 --> 01:20:47,630
ounce of rosin with our hair

1706
01:20:45,708 --> 01:20:48,859
straighteners and we sat there and we

1707
01:20:47,630 --> 01:20:50,389
were pressing and pressed and oppressive

1708
01:20:48,859 --> 01:20:52,908
depressive depressant of precedent like

1709
01:20:50,389 --> 01:20:55,399
an hour went by and I was like okay we

1710
01:20:52,908 --> 01:20:58,279
got 14 grams of rosin that's that's

1711
01:20:55,399 --> 01:21:00,349
enough we're done I can do 14 grams of

1712
01:20:58,279 --> 01:21:02,809
rosin in a single press now like just

1713
01:21:00,349 --> 01:21:05,599
make 14 grams of rosin like no problem

1714
01:21:02,809 --> 01:21:08,570
if I put 30 or 40 grams of high-grade

1715
01:21:05,599 --> 01:21:11,538
hash in there I could make 20 to 25 plus

1716
01:21:08,569 --> 01:21:13,308
grams of rosin in a single squish even

1717
01:21:11,538 --> 01:21:16,340
though where is my bike I get close to

1718
01:21:13,309 --> 01:21:19,159
10 grams of rosin and under you know in

1719
01:21:16,340 --> 01:21:21,800
like two minutes I have from just flour

1720
01:21:19,158 --> 01:21:23,688
just boom I just made 10 grams of rosin

1721
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:27,019
so that's pretty good for at home

1722
01:21:23,689 --> 01:21:28,610
I remember when beginning you would look

1723
01:21:27,019 --> 01:21:31,668
at a bag of flour and you would like

1724
01:21:28,609 --> 01:21:33,589
let's wash it that's all I used to do is

1725
01:21:31,668 --> 01:21:36,319
wash it again a lot that now you're

1726
01:21:33,590 --> 01:21:38,389
squishing everything I love it well I'm

1727
01:21:36,319 --> 01:21:40,158
squishing I'm squishing helping helping

1728
01:21:38,389 --> 01:21:41,659
a friend out who's you wants me to

1729
01:21:40,158 --> 01:21:43,729
squish a little bit

1730
01:21:41,659 --> 01:21:45,260
about all the different strains and

1731
01:21:43,729 --> 01:21:47,329
everything like that funny thing about

1732
01:21:45,260 --> 01:21:49,579
which squish better he means levels all

1733
01:21:47,329 --> 01:21:52,189
these different yeah it's it's really I

1734
01:21:49,579 --> 01:21:53,869
love it because I get to wash it all the

1735
01:21:52,189 --> 01:21:55,549
time well and that's why the pure

1736
01:21:53,869 --> 01:21:57,979
pressure is such a great press because

1737
01:21:55,550 --> 01:22:00,409
it's it's you're monitoring all of those

1738
01:21:57,979 --> 01:22:02,959
things you're literally putting your all

1739
01:22:00,409 --> 01:22:05,899
of that that information all all that

1740
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:07,609
data goes into your recipe with the name

1741
01:22:05,899 --> 01:22:09,439
of the cultivar that you use you could

1742
01:22:07,609 --> 01:22:11,899
do up to 30 different ones and it's nice

1743
01:22:09,439 --> 01:22:13,849
to be able to go back and and understand

1744
01:22:11,899 --> 01:22:15,379
what you know your yields were based on

1745
01:22:13,850 --> 01:22:16,579
all of those variables because I can

1746
01:22:15,380 --> 01:22:19,340
promise you if you change those

1747
01:22:16,579 --> 01:22:21,140
variables your your yields will change

1748
01:22:19,340 --> 01:22:23,150
and the quality of your rosin will

1749
01:22:21,140 --> 01:22:26,960
change obviously the variables that are

1750
01:22:23,149 --> 01:22:28,939
the heat of the of the the plates which

1751
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:30,739
is actually perfect timing for D 420

1752
01:22:28,939 --> 01:22:33,710
Katie favorite areas because dude I'll

1753
01:22:30,739 --> 01:22:35,659
never I'll never like dude I laughed so

1754
01:22:33,710 --> 01:22:37,220
[ __ ] hard at that time and I'm sorry

1755
01:22:35,659 --> 01:22:39,739
that I laughed because I know it was a

1756
01:22:37,220 --> 01:22:42,289
pisser you when you asked me what the

1757
01:22:39,739 --> 01:22:44,090
temperature with the temperature for the

1758
01:22:42,289 --> 01:22:47,090
rows and plates were and I was like oh

1759
01:22:44,090 --> 01:22:49,699
dude like to 220 or whatever between 180

1760
01:22:47,090 --> 01:22:52,400
and 220 and I forgot to say Fahrenheit

1761
01:22:49,699 --> 01:22:54,769
and we do live in Canada and where we

1762
01:22:52,399 --> 01:22:55,909
use Celsius so I was just [ __ ] I don't

1763
01:22:54,770 --> 01:22:58,220
know if I was stoned that day or

1764
01:22:55,909 --> 01:23:02,000
whatever but D went and did it at like

1765
01:22:58,220 --> 01:23:05,119
220 Celsius and I've never seen rosin

1766
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:08,960
spit he's like dude I got it all over my

1767
01:23:05,119 --> 01:23:12,229
shoes and my forehead like it was on my

1768
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:14,779
[ __ ] camera holder I'm gulp it and

1769
01:23:12,229 --> 01:23:16,399
it's all over the bottom of my hand and

1770
01:23:14,779 --> 01:23:20,739
my they just spitting out like it's mad

1771
01:23:16,399 --> 01:23:23,420
dude it was unbelievable that was

1772
01:23:20,739 --> 01:23:25,369
another great experiment like it's like

1773
01:23:23,420 --> 01:23:28,670
a sacrifice for sure but what an

1774
01:23:25,369 --> 01:23:31,340
experiment it was like it was spitting

1775
01:23:28,670 --> 01:23:33,079
out of his press and there was there was

1776
01:23:31,340 --> 01:23:36,850
guys making comments going you know

1777
01:23:33,079 --> 01:23:39,380
trying to be nice not going hey stupid

1778
01:23:36,850 --> 01:23:41,150
you know I think it's a little set-to hi

1779
01:23:39,380 --> 01:23:43,369
there D and all they're sort of people

1780
01:23:41,149 --> 01:23:44,869
being nice about it but [ __ ] really they

1781
01:23:43,369 --> 01:23:46,809
should have just said what the [ __ ] are

1782
01:23:44,869 --> 01:23:52,489
you doing dummy

1783
01:23:46,810 --> 01:23:54,770
anyways bah grandmother lovers yeah did

1784
01:23:52,489 --> 01:23:58,099
you listen to the first hour

1785
01:23:54,770 --> 01:24:00,860
there's a lot of delta-9 and health

1786
01:23:58,100 --> 01:24:02,930
aides know what I'm not gonna lie at one

1787
01:24:00,859 --> 01:24:07,219
point in time it didn't even sound

1788
01:24:02,930 --> 01:24:11,810
English I was thinking about it going

1789
01:24:07,220 --> 01:24:13,579
holy [ __ ] really high you know what

1790
01:24:11,810 --> 01:24:15,590
though I will say something Sam warned

1791
01:24:13,579 --> 01:24:18,140
me about the ice ers recently he said

1792
01:24:15,590 --> 01:24:20,360
listen it's very dry it's researchers

1793
01:24:18,140 --> 01:24:23,079
you know like I'd say a lot sometimes it

1794
01:24:20,359 --> 01:24:27,469
goes over my head and I was like damn

1795
01:24:23,079 --> 01:24:30,880
sam says completely changed the first

1796
01:24:27,470 --> 01:24:35,380
one I attended 25 years ago it was all

1797
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:39,050
of the funding came from the NID a

1798
01:24:35,380 --> 01:24:41,329
National Institute for drug abuse it's

1799
01:24:39,050 --> 01:24:43,850
not that they're biased but their name

1800
01:24:41,329 --> 01:24:47,600
says it all it's not that they're biased

1801
01:24:43,850 --> 01:24:51,500
but they're biased and it was also

1802
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:54,500
funded by the piss test companies so you

1803
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:57,409
know the drug testing companies were

1804
01:24:54,500 --> 01:25:00,409
funding research - but but that was who

1805
01:24:57,409 --> 01:25:02,989
funded everything you wanted fine to be

1806
01:25:00,409 --> 01:25:04,279
positive about cannabis nobody would

1807
01:25:02,989 --> 01:25:06,469
fund it period

1808
01:25:04,279 --> 01:25:07,789
well and to finish my thought that's why

1809
01:25:06,470 --> 01:25:10,190
I think I'm actually gonna be quite

1810
01:25:07,789 --> 01:25:11,930
excited and stoked to be at the ICRS

1811
01:25:10,189 --> 01:25:14,000
because although I didn't understand

1812
01:25:11,930 --> 01:25:15,590
everything dr. Mark was saying this

1813
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:17,510
morning on the same level as Kevin

1814
01:25:15,590 --> 01:25:19,190
seemed to understand it I definitely

1815
01:25:17,510 --> 01:25:20,659
felt like it was intriguing and

1816
01:25:19,189 --> 01:25:22,609
interesting and I wanted to hear more

1817
01:25:20,659 --> 01:25:25,609
about it so I'm looking forward to the

1818
01:25:22,609 --> 01:25:27,889
ICRS what do you need to know man what

1819
01:25:25,609 --> 01:25:31,039
if you didn't understand it chances are

1820
01:25:27,890 --> 01:25:32,720
a bunch of well no it's just it's not

1821
01:25:31,039 --> 01:25:34,609
that I didn't understand it I understood

1822
01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:36,860
the basis of what you were talking about

1823
01:25:34,609 --> 01:25:38,599
I just don't know all the terms I don't

1824
01:25:36,859 --> 01:25:40,670
know all the chemicals I don't know all

1825
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:44,420
the interactions on the same level that

1826
01:25:40,670 --> 01:25:45,770
you may take for granted so I found it

1827
01:25:44,420 --> 01:25:49,579
very interesting nonetheless

1828
01:25:45,770 --> 01:25:54,110
yeah questions are just reach out and

1829
01:25:49,579 --> 01:25:56,170
chat or reach out to YouTube I've tried

1830
01:25:54,109 --> 01:25:58,759
to break it down to make it as simple as

1831
01:25:56,170 --> 01:26:00,890
well and you and you did don't get me

1832
01:25:58,760 --> 01:26:03,050
wrong but the terminologies are

1833
01:26:00,890 --> 01:26:04,880
nonetheless the terminologies that are

1834
01:26:03,050 --> 01:26:07,010
required to use when discussing

1835
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:08,359
chemistry and so so you know some of

1836
01:26:07,010 --> 01:26:12,579
that was just

1837
01:26:08,359 --> 01:26:12,579
when a little deep welcome back my quest

1838
01:26:14,260 --> 01:26:18,560
we can hear you do you have any thoughts

1839
01:26:16,698 --> 01:26:23,859
to share on our interesting discussion

1840
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:27,350
this morning I did know I love it mark

1841
01:26:23,859 --> 01:26:30,259
something I've seen a lot of because now

1842
01:26:27,350 --> 01:26:33,440
that there's a lot of farms and labs

1843
01:26:30,260 --> 01:26:35,679
that are doing processing when they when

1844
01:26:33,439 --> 01:26:38,658
they do their their distillation they're

1845
01:26:35,679 --> 01:26:42,170
doing fractional distillation of

1846
01:26:38,658 --> 01:26:45,319
cannabinoids using a broad spectrum of

1847
01:26:42,170 --> 01:26:47,810
different types of equipment some of

1848
01:26:45,319 --> 01:26:52,719
them obviously are doing it hotter or

1849
01:26:47,810 --> 01:26:56,920
lower temperatures ranging from I guess

1850
01:26:52,719 --> 01:27:01,760
150 s up to the 200s under vacuum

1851
01:26:56,920 --> 01:27:04,819
centigrade and I definitely do see I

1852
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:09,579
think there was a comment earlier seeing

1853
01:27:04,819 --> 01:27:14,059
the oxidization of some of those

1854
01:27:09,579 --> 01:27:17,090
cannabinoids and pigments I don't know

1855
01:27:14,060 --> 01:27:19,100
mark I'd assume I'm seeing more

1856
01:27:17,090 --> 01:27:21,829
degradation in the short paths than in

1857
01:27:19,100 --> 01:27:24,619
the ruled films that we're doing because

1858
01:27:21,829 --> 01:27:28,130
because of the shorter residence time at

1859
01:27:24,618 --> 01:27:30,469
those temperatures yeah yeah yeah you

1860
01:27:28,130 --> 01:27:33,109
know a lot of it has to do with you got

1861
01:27:30,469 --> 01:27:35,868
to remember when you put these compounds

1862
01:27:33,109 --> 01:27:40,579
sorry my wife's running her hair dryer

1863
01:27:35,868 --> 01:27:42,019
the other room is that obnoxious shut

1864
01:27:40,579 --> 01:27:45,859
the door I'll shut the door hold on a

1865
01:27:42,020 --> 01:27:48,860
second it's not so bad mark I have my

1866
01:27:45,859 --> 01:27:53,599
headphones on and it's really a very ok

1867
01:27:48,859 --> 01:27:55,009
ok so I think the key is you got to

1868
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:57,650
remember when you heat up your

1869
01:27:55,010 --> 01:28:00,260
distillation pot and you're doing these

1870
01:27:57,649 --> 01:28:04,299
high-temperature vacuum distillation to

1871
01:28:00,260 --> 01:28:08,630
make distillate that you want to put as

1872
01:28:04,300 --> 01:28:12,500
clean a precursor into that pot as you

1873
01:28:08,630 --> 01:28:14,420
possibly can and when I say clean free

1874
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:17,179
of things that are gonna thermally

1875
01:28:14,420 --> 01:28:19,609
degrade to make noxious flavors that are

1876
01:28:17,179 --> 01:28:21,690
going to not only taint your distillate

1877
01:28:19,609 --> 01:28:25,170
but potentially could be

1878
01:28:21,689 --> 01:28:27,238
um hazardous to your health you know a

1879
01:28:25,170 --> 01:28:29,969
lot of these pesticides and a lot of

1880
01:28:27,238 --> 01:28:32,429
other residues that could potentially be

1881
01:28:29,969 --> 01:28:34,590
in a distillate pot you want to make

1882
01:28:32,430 --> 01:28:38,579
sure that they're not in there to begin

1883
01:28:34,590 --> 01:28:41,250
with so full winterization to where you

1884
01:28:38,579 --> 01:28:44,519
don't see any precipitation in an

1885
01:28:41,250 --> 01:28:51,420
ethanol concentrate frozen down to minus

1886
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:54,360
40 because any fat or lipids or waxes

1887
01:28:51,420 --> 01:28:58,319
that remain in your distillate precursor

1888
01:28:54,359 --> 01:29:01,109
when you go to heat it up are going to

1889
01:28:58,319 --> 01:29:06,090
degrade and when they degrade they

1890
01:29:01,109 --> 01:29:09,779
degrade into noxious smelling compounds

1891
01:29:06,090 --> 01:29:12,750
and you may recognize the burnt

1892
01:29:09,779 --> 01:29:16,039
you know rubber sort of flavor and some

1893
01:29:12,750 --> 01:29:19,770
distillate that sometimes again is a

1894
01:29:16,039 --> 01:29:22,350
hallmark of distillate that's made from

1895
01:29:19,770 --> 01:29:23,790
precursor that wasn't completely fully

1896
01:29:22,350 --> 01:29:27,030
winterized

1897
01:29:23,789 --> 01:29:29,789
and so the winterization again followed

1898
01:29:27,029 --> 01:29:32,759
by a lot of people are doing a variety

1899
01:29:29,789 --> 01:29:35,488
of different methods or scrubs to sort

1900
01:29:32,760 --> 01:29:40,619
of clean up their distillate precursor

1901
01:29:35,488 --> 01:29:43,079
to remove traces of unwanted component

1902
01:29:40,619 --> 01:29:45,448
but you want to try to make what you put

1903
01:29:43,079 --> 01:29:48,869
under thermal load in your distillation

1904
01:29:45,448 --> 01:29:52,549
pot as clean as it possibly can because

1905
01:29:48,869 --> 01:29:55,170
a lot of those compounds end up

1906
01:29:52,550 --> 01:29:57,300
degrading thermally and again they'll

1907
01:29:55,170 --> 01:30:01,460
coat is still with the cannabinoids and

1908
01:29:57,300 --> 01:30:04,860
and you'll get phantom peaks in your GC

1909
01:30:01,460 --> 01:30:08,189
people are using like like molecular

1910
01:30:04,859 --> 01:30:10,319
sieves clays and carbons again to clean

1911
01:30:08,189 --> 01:30:12,929
up the distillate precursor before it

1912
01:30:10,319 --> 01:30:15,869
gets heated up but go ahead Mike could

1913
01:30:12,930 --> 01:30:21,530
those could be accidents used in those

1914
01:30:15,869 --> 01:30:29,510
grubs be positive unwanted conversations

1915
01:30:21,529 --> 01:30:32,779
yeah it could really be mute you muted

1916
01:30:29,510 --> 01:30:34,699
somehow you muted yourself sorry I moved

1917
01:30:32,779 --> 01:30:37,519
myself did you hear me now

1918
01:30:34,699 --> 01:30:39,679
you guys hear me now okay yeah so the

1919
01:30:37,520 --> 01:30:41,330
preponderance of Delta eight and a lot

1920
01:30:39,680 --> 01:30:45,680
of those products leads me to believe

1921
01:30:41,329 --> 01:30:48,170
that yeah there's a lot of acidic scrubs

1922
01:30:45,680 --> 01:30:52,190
that basically are converting Delta 9

1923
01:30:48,170 --> 01:30:58,090
over 2 Delta 8 in that process so yeah I

1924
01:30:52,189 --> 01:30:58,089
mean I can't comment particularly on a

1925
01:30:58,659 --> 01:31:03,680
SOP or a process to do that because

1926
01:31:01,310 --> 01:31:06,400
we're still working it out ourselves but

1927
01:31:03,680 --> 01:31:10,909
I can tell you to you that certain

1928
01:31:06,399 --> 01:31:16,139
things like Z like clays and other

1929
01:31:10,909 --> 01:31:18,199
acidic clays are certainly used as a

1930
01:31:16,140 --> 01:31:18,200
you

1931
01:31:23,140 --> 01:31:25,200
you

1932
01:31:28,988 --> 01:31:43,129
did he freeze up well I'm pretty sure he

1933
01:31:35,059 --> 01:31:46,880
froze up [ __ ] bong red yeah obviously

1934
01:31:43,130 --> 01:31:49,880
what mark was commenting on did what

1935
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:52,670
we're seeing primarily when you're

1936
01:31:49,880 --> 01:31:54,229
dealing with the isolation of individual

1937
01:31:52,670 --> 01:31:58,069
cannabinoids has primarily been done

1938
01:31:54,229 --> 01:31:59,840
using physics doing precipitation at

1939
01:31:58,069 --> 01:32:03,408
cold temperatures with solvents

1940
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:06,469
primarily done with ethanol but most c1

1941
01:32:03,408 --> 01:32:09,379
through c5 alcohols can be used and then

1942
01:32:06,469 --> 01:32:12,198
now I guess over the last three years

1943
01:32:09,380 --> 01:32:13,578
five years the cannabis industry really

1944
01:32:12,198 --> 01:32:17,328
taken off doing fractional distillation

1945
01:32:13,578 --> 01:32:19,279
to create those distillates and

1946
01:32:17,328 --> 01:32:23,599
distillates are fairly popular within

1947
01:32:19,279 --> 01:32:25,429
the vape pen industry but they're one of

1948
01:32:23,599 --> 01:32:28,729
the things that we're really seeing is

1949
01:32:25,429 --> 01:32:31,368
that it's a wonderful way to remove all

1950
01:32:28,729 --> 01:32:33,979
the heavy and light molecular weight

1951
01:32:31,368 --> 01:32:36,799
stuff but obviously some of those you

1952
01:32:33,979 --> 01:32:43,610
want to retain the terpenes being a

1953
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:45,139
broad class of essential oils that many

1954
01:32:43,609 --> 01:32:50,058
research papers have shown to be

1955
01:32:45,139 --> 01:32:51,650
beneficial so so Mike do you because

1956
01:32:50,059 --> 01:32:53,360
I've always noticed this in the

1957
01:32:51,649 --> 01:32:54,948
distillate world and I don't I haven't

1958
01:32:53,359 --> 01:32:56,689
got too deep into the world of the

1959
01:32:54,948 --> 01:32:58,638
distillates but I have friends that have

1960
01:32:56,689 --> 01:33:00,348
like VTA units and whatnot they're

1961
01:32:58,639 --> 01:33:02,779
running through short paths molecular

1962
01:33:00,349 --> 01:33:08,590
distillation and it's all under a vacuum

1963
01:33:02,779 --> 01:33:11,448
so they're decarboxylated prior to the

1964
01:33:08,590 --> 01:33:13,429
putting it through the unit and the

1965
01:33:11,448 --> 01:33:15,198
terpenes that they had sort of

1966
01:33:13,429 --> 01:33:16,729
fractioned off were possibly the

1967
01:33:15,198 --> 01:33:18,469
worst-smelling compounds i've ever

1968
01:33:16,729 --> 01:33:20,929
smelled in my life like they were just

1969
01:33:18,469 --> 01:33:22,639
so horrific and bad I'm like is the

1970
01:33:20,929 --> 01:33:24,828
distillate world not figuring out to

1971
01:33:22,639 --> 01:33:27,109
make the terpenes you know extract their

1972
01:33:24,828 --> 01:33:30,828
terpenes first and then run the material

1973
01:33:27,109 --> 01:33:34,289
for for distillate that's exactly you

1974
01:33:30,828 --> 01:33:36,869
when you when you do there's kind of

1975
01:33:34,289 --> 01:33:39,720
a lot of what you're smelling in that

1976
01:33:36,869 --> 01:33:42,630
distillate is his thermally degraded

1977
01:33:39,720 --> 01:33:47,730
free fatty acids and essential oils that

1978
01:33:42,630 --> 01:33:49,859
as you're exposing those oils to those

1979
01:33:47,729 --> 01:33:53,549
thermal temperatures and the presence of

1980
01:33:49,859 --> 01:33:55,380
oxygen you're cleaving off carbons and

1981
01:33:53,550 --> 01:33:57,510
those are not only clear when you're

1982
01:33:55,380 --> 01:34:01,650
breaking thermally decomposing free

1983
01:33:57,510 --> 01:34:05,239
fatty acids trays phospholipids etc

1984
01:34:01,649 --> 01:34:10,019
within within the distillation of app

1985
01:34:05,239 --> 01:34:12,210
it's the creates missiles and those

1986
01:34:10,020 --> 01:34:14,400
artifact artifacts that are created by

1987
01:34:12,210 --> 01:34:15,600
that obviously what you want to remove

1988
01:34:14,399 --> 01:34:16,469
that before it goes through that

1989
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:20,880
distillation

1990
01:34:16,470 --> 01:34:22,440
so now you know early on when before

1991
01:34:20,880 --> 01:34:23,880
everyone was doing distillation everyone

1992
01:34:22,439 --> 01:34:26,369
was just winterizing and putting

1993
01:34:23,880 --> 01:34:28,529
winterized oil in vape pens you could do

1994
01:34:26,369 --> 01:34:31,109
that cold temperature winterization and

1995
01:34:28,529 --> 01:34:35,250
retain some of the terpenes but now that

1996
01:34:31,109 --> 01:34:38,279
you have the thermal treatments you have

1997
01:34:35,250 --> 01:34:40,350
to separate your terpenes before doing

1998
01:34:38,279 --> 01:34:43,039
that isolation and then ideally

1999
01:34:40,350 --> 01:34:48,440
recombining the native terpenes back in

2000
01:34:43,039 --> 01:34:52,019
or introducing engineered terpene ratios

2001
01:34:48,439 --> 01:34:54,000
but it's really taken off in you know

2002
01:34:52,020 --> 01:34:57,690
the fractional distillation and

2003
01:34:54,000 --> 01:35:00,949
isolation has really taken off and in

2004
01:34:57,689 --> 01:35:04,619
the CBD hemp realm because you know a

2005
01:35:00,949 --> 01:35:07,289
point a point three percent flower once

2006
01:35:04,619 --> 01:35:08,729
you start extracting it may have more

2007
01:35:07,289 --> 01:35:10,890
than 0.3 percent of the other

2008
01:35:08,729 --> 01:35:12,779
cannabinoids so then you have to take it

2009
01:35:10,890 --> 01:35:16,050
to that essentially fractionally

2010
01:35:12,779 --> 01:35:19,130
distally sector to essentially remove

2011
01:35:16,050 --> 01:35:21,329
all the cannabinoids that can prevent

2012
01:35:19,130 --> 01:35:24,180
companies from distributing the hemp

2013
01:35:21,329 --> 01:35:26,789
oils so a lot of them have to

2014
01:35:24,180 --> 01:35:29,700
essentially do that and even in these

2015
01:35:26,789 --> 01:35:32,430
bigger states there's a bunch of people

2016
01:35:29,699 --> 01:35:35,189
that obviously your harvests are gonna

2017
01:35:32,430 --> 01:35:37,590
be seized based on the weather of the

2018
01:35:35,189 --> 01:35:40,379
year you're gonna have trends where you

2019
01:35:37,590 --> 01:35:41,850
have forest fires cause crop loss and

2020
01:35:40,380 --> 01:35:43,590
you don't farmers don't want to lose

2021
01:35:41,850 --> 01:35:45,140
that crop loss so they want to try and

2022
01:35:43,590 --> 01:35:47,610
recover whatever cannabinoids are there

2023
01:35:45,140 --> 01:35:48,030
even though the terpenes may not be that

2024
01:35:47,609 --> 01:35:50,848
great

2025
01:35:48,029 --> 01:35:53,460
so they can still recoup some of the

2026
01:35:50,849 --> 01:36:01,860
loss selling it into the edible market

2027
01:35:53,460 --> 01:36:06,118
or top but yeah awesome yeah no that

2028
01:36:01,859 --> 01:36:08,038
makes sense it's welcome back yeah sorry

2029
01:36:06,118 --> 01:36:10,109
about that I was just again finishing up

2030
01:36:08,038 --> 01:36:12,389
on the point of make your distillate

2031
01:36:10,109 --> 01:36:13,859
precursor as clean as it can possibly be

2032
01:36:12,389 --> 01:36:16,800
because a lot of the things in there

2033
01:36:13,859 --> 01:36:21,269
degrade to give off flavor eating think

2034
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:26,670
you should a market you ever seen these

2035
01:36:21,270 --> 01:36:31,170
cigarettes doing any look at that I know

2036
01:36:26,670 --> 01:36:36,139
you can see it with nicotine right yeah

2037
01:36:31,170 --> 01:36:36,139
well my gosh don't get me started on

2038
01:36:36,710 --> 01:36:44,880
nicotine nicotine 60 milligrams is toxic

2039
01:36:41,729 --> 01:36:48,629
to the average sized adult do you

2040
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:51,840
believe that like a 60 milligram dose it

2041
01:36:48,630 --> 01:36:54,300
seems like it's hardly a lot at all

2042
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:58,409
because when you think about THC and 60

2043
01:36:54,300 --> 01:37:01,590
milligrams milligrams of nicotine is

2044
01:36:58,408 --> 01:37:05,549
enough I think by oral ingestion based

2045
01:37:01,590 --> 01:37:07,920
on known toxicity data to kill human

2046
01:37:05,550 --> 01:37:10,369
yeah I don't they don't they put horses

2047
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:14,309
down with pure nicotine shots

2048
01:37:10,368 --> 01:37:15,719
do they really oh my god that's what I

2049
01:37:14,309 --> 01:37:17,190
heard yeah there were these big syringes

2050
01:37:15,719 --> 01:37:18,719
it's just like boom that thing's dead

2051
01:37:17,189 --> 01:37:25,859
before the plunger reaches like the

2052
01:37:18,719 --> 01:37:29,698
halfway point or whatever nicotine is no

2053
01:37:25,859 --> 01:37:31,288
joke I know it's really toxic so imagine

2054
01:37:29,698 --> 01:37:33,629
I don't know like how many milligrams

2055
01:37:31,288 --> 01:37:36,149
are in a cigarette you know compared to

2056
01:37:33,630 --> 01:37:38,279
how many milligrams of like THC or in

2057
01:37:36,149 --> 01:37:40,170
like a joint like how that compares with

2058
01:37:38,279 --> 01:37:42,828
one another but again if you were to

2059
01:37:40,170 --> 01:37:45,840
think that THC had the toxicity of

2060
01:37:42,828 --> 01:37:48,479
nicotine first of all we'd probably all

2061
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:51,960
be dead by now as much cannabis that we

2062
01:37:48,479 --> 01:37:54,629
all smoked but you know I mean if THC

2063
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:57,480
was as deadly as nicotine oh my gosh I

2064
01:37:54,630 --> 01:38:00,029
mean it's just like it's crazy

2065
01:37:57,479 --> 01:38:02,279
nicotine's don't have to do all kinds of

2066
01:38:00,029 --> 01:38:03,899
toxic chemistry and

2067
01:38:02,279 --> 01:38:05,340
I always told people that wanted to quit

2068
01:38:03,899 --> 01:38:07,229
smoking I just said eat a pack of

2069
01:38:05,340 --> 01:38:13,969
cigarettes I swear you'll never smoke

2070
01:38:07,229 --> 01:38:17,359
another one again oh you will be sick

2071
01:38:13,969 --> 01:38:21,560
especially after you vomit it all up

2072
01:38:17,359 --> 01:38:22,948
damn get one stuck in your nose cavity

2073
01:38:21,560 --> 01:38:25,350
yeah

2074
01:38:22,948 --> 01:38:27,029
I mean it's hard especially when you see

2075
01:38:25,350 --> 01:38:29,880
people who smoke cigarettes in and

2076
01:38:27,029 --> 01:38:33,000
around cannabis production operations

2077
01:38:29,880 --> 01:38:34,529
you know you can smell cigarettes and

2078
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:36,060
cigarette breath on people and people

2079
01:38:34,529 --> 01:38:38,789
who smoke cigarettes smell like

2080
01:38:36,060 --> 01:38:40,620
cigarettes it's like you got to think

2081
01:38:38,789 --> 01:38:42,119
that again the plants could some house

2082
01:38:40,619 --> 01:38:45,809
that's that can't they

2083
01:38:42,119 --> 01:38:47,760
I sure always was bothered when people

2084
01:38:45,810 --> 01:38:50,219
would smoke cigarettes either in the

2085
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:52,980
grow room or outside and then go in the

2086
01:38:50,219 --> 01:38:56,698
grow room I was always done right like

2087
01:38:52,979 --> 01:38:59,959
right at that envelope of that fresh air

2088
01:38:56,698 --> 01:39:01,939
supposed to be fresh air outside the

2089
01:38:59,960 --> 01:39:05,609
nicotine and tobacco

2090
01:39:01,939 --> 01:39:11,579
standing under the intake fan you want

2091
01:39:05,609 --> 01:39:18,539
to tell these in theory you can transmit

2092
01:39:11,579 --> 01:39:21,779
tobacco viruses to cannabis by now

2093
01:39:18,539 --> 01:39:25,948
nobody sure if you have to handle living

2094
01:39:21,779 --> 01:39:30,300
plants recent dead plants or old

2095
01:39:25,948 --> 01:39:33,359
cigarettes but it it has been shown to

2096
01:39:30,300 --> 01:39:36,300
be transmitted but how easily I'm not so

2097
01:39:33,359 --> 01:39:39,269
sure one more no no I wonder how many

2098
01:39:36,300 --> 01:39:42,179
people cause their own suffering in the

2099
01:39:39,270 --> 01:39:44,969
grow room by having like very poorly

2100
01:39:42,179 --> 01:39:46,260
taken care of house plants or plants

2101
01:39:44,969 --> 01:39:49,649
around their property that are just

2102
01:39:46,260 --> 01:39:51,690
suffering with bugs and you know mildews

2103
01:39:49,649 --> 01:39:53,309
and and then just not putting it

2104
01:39:51,689 --> 01:39:55,259
together it's like dude you got like a

2105
01:39:53,310 --> 01:39:58,820
plant in your living room full of spider

2106
01:39:55,260 --> 01:40:03,150
mites I think it might be the culprit

2107
01:39:58,819 --> 01:40:06,479
the cannabis viruses also have little or

2108
01:40:03,149 --> 01:40:10,138
no symptoms so you know there might be

2109
01:40:06,479 --> 01:40:12,988
you know 10 or 20 viruses that have been

2110
01:40:10,139 --> 01:40:15,390
found in cannabis but most of them are

2111
01:40:12,988 --> 01:40:19,259
symptom free there's only two or three

2112
01:40:15,390 --> 01:40:21,420
really really dangerous right and by

2113
01:40:19,260 --> 01:40:23,850
symptom 3ds do you obviously think that

2114
01:40:21,420 --> 01:40:26,039
it would probably still affect the

2115
01:40:23,850 --> 01:40:29,780
plant's ability to express itself to its

2116
01:40:26,039 --> 01:40:32,369
maximum potential maybe a tiny bit yeah

2117
01:40:29,779 --> 01:40:34,619
maybe you could tell if you were used to

2118
01:40:32,369 --> 01:40:38,340
the variety and you had grown up by the

2119
01:40:34,619 --> 01:40:41,760
hectare for a decade or two and then it

2120
01:40:38,340 --> 01:40:45,449
had this problem and you noticed a

2121
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:49,050
slight reduction or something but yeah I

2122
01:40:45,449 --> 01:40:53,239
mean my symptom-free it really means

2123
01:40:49,050 --> 01:40:56,880
really but it's not causing an economic

2124
01:40:53,239 --> 01:40:59,189
well I had invited Ian Davidson in today

2125
01:40:56,880 --> 01:41:02,010
he was unable to come from Segura

2126
01:40:59,189 --> 01:41:03,839
international tissue culture company

2127
01:41:02,010 --> 01:41:05,880
he's a large-scale grower down in

2128
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:08,730
California that grows a substantial

2129
01:41:05,880 --> 01:41:09,869
amount of cannabis and and I was really

2130
01:41:08,729 --> 01:41:11,729
hoping he was gonna be able to come

2131
01:41:09,869 --> 01:41:13,439
today but maybe next week we'll get into

2132
01:41:11,729 --> 01:41:15,299
tissue culture and talk about the

2133
01:41:13,439 --> 01:41:17,729
renewed figure that can occur when you

2134
01:41:15,300 --> 01:41:18,690
can clean up a plant of all of the fungi

2135
01:41:17,729 --> 01:41:20,399
microbials

2136
01:41:18,689 --> 01:41:22,349
and pathogens that have been pregnant

2137
01:41:20,399 --> 01:41:25,379
themselves into that plant over the

2138
01:41:22,350 --> 01:41:27,180
course of five or ten or 20 years of you

2139
01:41:25,380 --> 01:41:29,819
know cloning it in the in the humidity

2140
01:41:27,180 --> 01:41:32,420
domes passing it on growing it in a

2141
01:41:29,819 --> 01:41:34,380
garage to a bedroom to a whatever

2142
01:41:32,420 --> 01:41:37,170
definitely a super interesting

2143
01:41:34,380 --> 01:41:41,550
conversation that I look forward to

2144
01:41:37,170 --> 01:41:46,319
having spreading

2145
01:41:41,550 --> 01:41:50,010
most of the problems viruses they are

2146
01:41:46,319 --> 01:41:54,269
the vectors being successful they're the

2147
01:41:50,010 --> 01:41:56,730
vectors hey talking with some people

2148
01:41:54,270 --> 01:41:58,920
among the seed companies and how all new

2149
01:41:56,729 --> 01:42:01,589
tissue culture is and how its thriving

2150
01:41:58,920 --> 01:42:03,930
now or see it everything's turning into

2151
01:42:01,590 --> 01:42:07,260
tissue cultures because of course less

2152
01:42:03,930 --> 01:42:09,210
disease left homes yeah well let not it

2153
01:42:07,260 --> 01:42:11,220
not too many people doing it just yet to

2154
01:42:09,210 --> 01:42:13,350
making it available to most people so I

2155
01:42:11,220 --> 01:42:16,289
think most people are still doing clones

2156
01:42:13,350 --> 01:42:18,420
and seeds but you could definitely see

2157
01:42:16,289 --> 01:42:20,489
it as when you look at all the clonally

2158
01:42:18,420 --> 01:42:22,800
produced plants on the planet that it's

2159
01:42:20,489 --> 01:42:27,029
been something they've all come to the

2160
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:27,960
conclusion that this will help this is

2161
01:42:27,029 --> 01:42:31,050
the widening

2162
01:42:27,960 --> 01:42:33,390
Street all new grape plants are

2163
01:42:31,050 --> 01:42:43,890
certified by Irish free well really

2164
01:42:33,390 --> 01:42:45,630
produce I think we need a bomber there's

2165
01:42:43,890 --> 01:43:02,789
been some interesting research coming

2166
01:42:45,630 --> 01:43:06,300
out of California's about was actually

2167
01:43:02,789 --> 01:43:11,039
being able to friend where people were

2168
01:43:06,300 --> 01:43:15,510
failing microbial based on where upwind

2169
01:43:11,039 --> 01:43:17,010
the forest fires I think they were they

2170
01:43:15,510 --> 01:43:19,350
were discussing whether or not the

2171
01:43:17,010 --> 01:43:22,409
forest fires were inadvertently

2172
01:43:19,350 --> 01:43:25,230
spreading molds and mildews from the

2173
01:43:22,409 --> 01:43:31,439
old-growth forests through the hills

2174
01:43:25,229 --> 01:43:34,879
into the ropes Wow traveling on the

2175
01:43:31,439 --> 01:43:42,899
smoke traveling in the air being blown

2176
01:43:34,880 --> 01:43:44,730
spores traveling on the ash and I guess

2177
01:43:42,899 --> 01:43:46,439
even of the when a forest fire is

2178
01:43:44,729 --> 01:43:48,269
occurring you got to think that all the

2179
01:43:46,439 --> 01:43:50,000
insects are like buggering off out of

2180
01:43:48,270 --> 01:43:53,430
there so there's probably like this mass

2181
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:55,560
migration of insects traveling away from

2182
01:43:53,430 --> 01:43:57,659
the heat of the smoke in the air they

2183
01:43:55,560 --> 01:44:00,360
and like Sam said they're also going to

2184
01:43:57,659 --> 01:44:02,609
be carrying as well and just after a

2185
01:44:00,359 --> 01:44:04,439
forest fire basically the forest is

2186
01:44:02,609 --> 01:44:06,750
ready to regenerate so basically

2187
01:44:04,439 --> 01:44:08,759
germination and everything is

2188
01:44:06,750 --> 01:44:10,920
upregulated in such a way that

2189
01:44:08,760 --> 01:44:15,060
everything sort of regenerates and and

2190
01:44:10,920 --> 01:44:17,940
takes hold so there's actually compounds

2191
01:44:15,060 --> 01:44:22,070
that are found in the soot that are

2192
01:44:17,939 --> 01:44:25,079
actually promoters to seed germination

2193
01:44:22,069 --> 01:44:26,909
so there's a series of compounds called

2194
01:44:25,079 --> 01:44:29,460
Beauty no lines which are naturally

2195
01:44:26,909 --> 01:44:36,000
occurring compounds that actually they

2196
01:44:29,460 --> 01:44:38,310
find in the forest after after forest

2197
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:41,489
fires that are basically responsible for

2198
01:44:38,310 --> 01:44:44,310
again the up regulation of now

2199
01:44:41,489 --> 01:44:47,969
the forestation of what's been recently

2200
01:44:44,310 --> 01:44:50,190
deforested in a fire yeah it's

2201
01:44:47,970 --> 01:44:52,800
interesting in BC I'm it could be

2202
01:44:50,189 --> 01:44:55,829
elsewhere as well but we have this plant

2203
01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:59,340
called fire wheat and it's just it's the

2204
01:44:55,829 --> 01:45:01,590
first to sort of you know get into the

2205
01:44:59,340 --> 01:45:03,449
soil after a forest fire it's just one

2206
01:45:01,590 --> 01:45:10,050
it's one of the first that shows up like

2207
01:45:03,449 --> 01:45:12,029
every time right it's the colonizer we

2208
01:45:10,050 --> 01:45:14,340
had a lot of fires in BC the last few

2209
01:45:12,029 --> 01:45:18,599
years in northern BC here especially as

2210
01:45:14,340 --> 01:45:21,390
well and last year was a huge problem

2211
01:45:18,600 --> 01:45:23,250
for a lot of growers in the North Powder

2212
01:45:21,390 --> 01:45:26,490
Mill dews and all those types of things

2213
01:45:23,250 --> 01:45:29,789
like the shitty parts of the forest

2214
01:45:26,489 --> 01:45:34,019
fighters that come you know there's you

2215
01:45:29,789 --> 01:45:36,149
know there was one thing that everybody

2216
01:45:34,020 --> 01:45:37,920
was uh the government was putting this

2217
01:45:36,149 --> 01:45:40,559
out to [ __ ] all your plants up and all

2218
01:45:37,920 --> 01:45:41,760
that sort of [ __ ] in the old days was

2219
01:45:40,560 --> 01:45:48,840
there a theory like that going around

2220
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:50,369
does anybody remember yeah yeah but with

2221
01:45:48,840 --> 01:45:52,140
with the outbreaks that we had last

2222
01:45:50,369 --> 01:45:56,250
summer and everything clearly ought to

2223
01:45:52,140 --> 01:45:59,850
just take hall rooms empty um take

2224
01:45:56,250 --> 01:46:03,750
everything out of the rooms new plastic

2225
01:45:59,850 --> 01:46:06,120
new poly new or new paint every chord

2226
01:46:03,750 --> 01:46:09,420
every fan blade everything needed to be

2227
01:46:06,119 --> 01:46:13,050
sanitized every single part of the room

2228
01:46:09,420 --> 01:46:15,690
inside out underneath on top had to be

2229
01:46:13,050 --> 01:46:17,369
cleaned thoroughly before we could get

2230
01:46:15,689 --> 01:46:17,819
rid of it and it was just it was

2231
01:46:17,369 --> 01:46:20,309
horrible

2232
01:46:17,819 --> 01:46:22,500
it was a lot of fires up here the smokes

2233
01:46:20,310 --> 01:46:25,020
were smoke was even getting in the smoke

2234
01:46:22,500 --> 01:46:29,220
all around us for [ __ ] sakes it was it

2235
01:46:25,020 --> 01:46:31,530
was harshest here habits for all of it

2236
01:46:29,220 --> 01:46:33,000
it was heavy heavy smoke all through the

2237
01:46:31,529 --> 01:46:34,889
region so let's hope we don't get too

2238
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:37,319
many fires this year yeah it's good to

2239
01:46:34,890 --> 01:46:39,210
keep smoke away from your curing

2240
01:46:37,319 --> 01:46:42,090
cannabis plants I've definitely seen

2241
01:46:39,210 --> 01:46:43,859
more than a few hippie jars of cannabis

2242
01:46:42,090 --> 01:46:46,430
passed over to my nose have been like

2243
01:46:43,859 --> 01:46:49,170
we're curing this near your wood stove

2244
01:46:46,430 --> 01:46:51,360
like that were you using a wood stove

2245
01:46:49,170 --> 01:46:53,220
while curing this and the herb will just

2246
01:46:51,359 --> 01:46:54,849
smell like blanketed with with that

2247
01:46:53,220 --> 01:46:58,810
smoky

2248
01:46:54,850 --> 01:47:01,570
it's either what were using those sulfur

2249
01:46:58,810 --> 01:47:03,550
burners and in their vet rooms or

2250
01:47:01,569 --> 01:47:05,170
anywhere in the in the place and then

2251
01:47:03,550 --> 01:47:11,860
they're making oil out of their product

2252
01:47:05,170 --> 01:47:13,930
in the bug we use the pot that's all for

2253
01:47:11,859 --> 01:47:17,349
burgers like yeah but only had it going

2254
01:47:13,930 --> 01:47:19,420
on in my bedroom I can smell it on this

2255
01:47:17,350 --> 01:47:23,380
instantly that's all I smell I don't

2256
01:47:19,420 --> 01:47:25,659
smell the quality I spell yeah bubble

2257
01:47:23,380 --> 01:47:28,329
bags turn me on to the powdery mildew

2258
01:47:25,659 --> 01:47:31,420
that people were spraying defender and

2259
01:47:28,329 --> 01:47:33,250
other of these sulfur burners on I had

2260
01:47:31,420 --> 01:47:35,590
no idea about it until I started making

2261
01:47:33,250 --> 01:47:39,340
bubble and the first time I made bubble

2262
01:47:35,590 --> 01:47:42,760
with some defender sprayed material it

2263
01:47:39,340 --> 01:47:45,430
smelt like a pack of matches being lit

2264
01:47:42,760 --> 01:47:47,140
if you just lit the edge of the hash it

2265
01:47:45,430 --> 01:47:49,300
was super melty and beautiful and I'll

2266
01:47:47,140 --> 01:47:50,440
never forget I lived two doors down it

2267
01:47:49,300 --> 01:47:53,800
was like 20 years ago

2268
01:47:50,439 --> 01:47:56,349
I hop that piece of hash like like

2269
01:47:53,800 --> 01:47:58,360
almost an ounce of it off my deck into

2270
01:47:56,350 --> 01:48:01,630
the forest because it was that runed

2271
01:47:58,359 --> 01:48:05,319
there was no saving this product you

2272
01:48:01,630 --> 01:48:08,260
feel that should apply it's definitely

2273
01:48:05,319 --> 01:48:11,949
not it was 20 years ago but and I can

2274
01:48:08,260 --> 01:48:13,869
make more in a mood I'll see Johnny be

2275
01:48:11,949 --> 01:48:16,590
outside my house with a shovel in the

2276
01:48:13,869 --> 01:48:16,590
next couple of days

2277
01:48:16,649 --> 01:48:30,099
you think he's joking what's that what's

2278
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:32,079
that my yeah we have great mushroom

2279
01:48:30,100 --> 01:48:36,990
patches in our woods we've got the

2280
01:48:32,079 --> 01:48:40,449
science growing quite quite prolifically

2281
01:48:36,989 --> 01:48:43,569
here and around my little village there

2282
01:48:40,449 --> 01:48:46,090
woodchip hall from here to like almost

2283
01:48:43,569 --> 01:48:48,789
to the bridge to Vancouver which is the

2284
01:48:46,090 --> 01:48:51,640
most of West Vancouver all the

2285
01:48:48,789 --> 01:48:54,340
boulevards everything is wood chip and

2286
01:48:51,640 --> 01:48:57,220
the wood chips of course our scientist

2287
01:48:54,340 --> 01:48:59,560
and friendly so we get some just

2288
01:48:57,220 --> 01:49:01,329
wonderful mushrooms it's nice to be able

2289
01:48:59,560 --> 01:49:03,100
to pick psychedelic mushrooms I'm not

2290
01:49:01,329 --> 01:49:08,698
gonna lie it's still something I quite

2291
01:49:03,100 --> 01:49:11,219
enjoy doing it's a great

2292
01:49:08,698 --> 01:49:13,729
all kinds of mushrooms I think

2293
01:49:11,219 --> 01:49:18,239
chantrelle might be one of my favorite

2294
01:49:13,729 --> 01:49:21,928
what's that Sam I really enjoy picking

2295
01:49:18,238 --> 01:49:23,789
chanterelle mushrooms Oh chanterelles

2296
01:49:21,929 --> 01:49:27,060
yeah I have a friend locally here who

2297
01:49:23,789 --> 01:49:28,920
picks all the the edible mushrooms quite

2298
01:49:27,060 --> 01:49:30,989
a few of them from morels to

2299
01:49:28,920 --> 01:49:33,060
chanterelles and maybe another he's a

2300
01:49:30,988 --> 01:49:35,579
forager he goes into the he finds all

2301
01:49:33,060 --> 01:49:37,830
the little herbs and berries and stuff

2302
01:49:35,579 --> 01:49:41,729
that you can even have a Maastricht one

2303
01:49:37,829 --> 01:49:44,760
day he actually he actually drew that

2304
01:49:41,729 --> 01:49:48,238
bubbleman picture there that's

2305
01:49:44,760 --> 01:49:49,860
pointillism 110 hours bubbleman sitting

2306
01:49:48,238 --> 01:49:52,229
on the moon trichome it's all dots

2307
01:49:49,859 --> 01:49:56,429
there's not a single line in this

2308
01:49:52,229 --> 01:49:58,409
particular picture so Shawn Michaels

2309
01:49:56,429 --> 01:50:00,270
I'll have to get him on past church one

2310
01:49:58,409 --> 01:50:05,159
day and we'll talk about foraging food

2311
01:50:00,270 --> 01:50:08,310
in the forest it's a lot of the goop

2312
01:50:05,159 --> 01:50:10,019
those were wondering if that if anyone

2313
01:50:08,310 --> 01:50:12,870
has anyone having issues identifying

2314
01:50:10,020 --> 01:50:16,560
them in the field and would a PCR assay

2315
01:50:12,869 --> 01:50:19,729
helped them or you guys pretty good at

2316
01:50:16,560 --> 01:50:21,780
identifying cubensis from from others I

2317
01:50:19,729 --> 01:50:23,639
mean I'm pretty good at it I learned

2318
01:50:21,779 --> 01:50:25,319
from Paul Stamets he's got a wonderful

2319
01:50:23,640 --> 01:50:27,199
book out there called my psilocybin

2320
01:50:25,319 --> 01:50:30,479
mushrooms around the world and I was

2321
01:50:27,198 --> 01:50:33,988
there's definitely you know ways to

2322
01:50:30,479 --> 01:50:36,809
learn he's got like a trio of methods

2323
01:50:33,988 --> 01:50:39,629
that you know there's the the thin layer

2324
01:50:36,810 --> 01:50:41,429
that's clear that sits on top of the

2325
01:50:39,630 --> 01:50:43,529
psilocybin mushroom that you can kind of

2326
01:50:41,429 --> 01:50:47,190
peel off and then there's obviously the

2327
01:50:43,529 --> 01:50:49,439
blueing spores putting them on on a

2328
01:50:47,189 --> 01:50:51,119
piece of white paper it's very that one

2329
01:50:49,439 --> 01:50:52,738
to me is like that if you've got a good

2330
01:50:51,119 --> 01:50:55,170
eyesight and you can see the color

2331
01:50:52,738 --> 01:50:57,178
spectrum well the poisonous ones like

2332
01:50:55,170 --> 01:50:59,069
gallery nose which are I think some of

2333
01:50:57,179 --> 01:51:01,319
the most deadly ones you're gonna be

2334
01:50:59,069 --> 01:51:04,679
related yeah they have they have a rusty

2335
01:51:01,319 --> 01:51:07,319
Brown Spore whereas the psilocybin has a

2336
01:51:04,679 --> 01:51:10,800
very like purple asks for and when you

2337
01:51:07,319 --> 01:51:12,750
have them side by side they're very very

2338
01:51:10,800 --> 01:51:14,010
easy to distinguish the difference in

2339
01:51:12,750 --> 01:51:15,899
the two of them and then of course the

2340
01:51:14,010 --> 01:51:18,210
bruising on the silicide and the

2341
01:51:15,899 --> 01:51:19,829
gallerina doesn't bruise at all whereas

2342
01:51:18,210 --> 01:51:21,420
the psilocybin swill most assuredly

2343
01:51:19,829 --> 01:51:21,960
unless you pick them and put them right

2344
01:51:21,420 --> 01:51:24,569
into your

2345
01:51:21,960 --> 01:51:27,329
if you're picking them to collect them

2346
01:51:24,569 --> 01:51:29,069
to dry them they'll have glued you know

2347
01:51:27,329 --> 01:51:31,050
wherever you pick them from wherever you

2348
01:51:29,069 --> 01:51:33,239
touch them from regardless even of the

2349
01:51:31,050 --> 01:51:35,970
low psilocybin content ones like stun

2350
01:51:33,239 --> 01:51:38,219
Z's they still do it and the higher

2351
01:51:35,970 --> 01:51:40,530
psilocybin content ones like as our

2352
01:51:38,220 --> 01:51:44,369
essence and sighin essence these ones

2353
01:51:40,529 --> 01:51:46,979
blew greatly it's it's I don't know of

2354
01:51:44,369 --> 01:51:50,819
any other variety a mushroom that looks

2355
01:51:46,979 --> 01:52:06,919
anything like psilocybin the Blues ya

2356
01:51:50,819 --> 01:52:14,519
know people who are in the field can do

2357
01:52:06,920 --> 01:52:16,800
tests to see if potentially new yeah so

2358
01:52:14,520 --> 01:52:20,370
you can probably do actually a in the

2359
01:52:16,800 --> 01:52:22,350
field RNA test on that to actually look

2360
01:52:20,369 --> 01:52:27,449
at RNA levels of that gene because there

2361
01:52:22,350 --> 01:52:28,770
can be both urns that you know mushroom

2362
01:52:27,449 --> 01:52:31,439
the mushroom and so some are really

2363
01:52:28,770 --> 01:52:32,910
potent in some arts and so it's easy the

2364
01:52:31,439 --> 01:52:34,889
genetic ones are really easy you could

2365
01:52:32,909 --> 01:52:36,720
actually target that gene and look for

2366
01:52:34,890 --> 01:52:38,579
it but I think you'd probably want to go

2367
01:52:36,720 --> 01:52:42,659
after the RNA just so you could see if

2368
01:52:38,579 --> 01:52:45,809
this permission in terms of not only is

2369
01:52:42,659 --> 01:52:47,220
it cubensis but how much is it making it

2370
01:52:45,810 --> 01:52:48,539
wouldn't be as good as measuring the

2371
01:52:47,220 --> 01:52:49,770
compound but it's a little bit harder to

2372
01:52:48,539 --> 01:52:52,079
bring a little equipment into the field

2373
01:52:49,770 --> 01:52:55,940
to test with this stuff so you the RNA

2374
01:52:52,079 --> 01:52:55,939
would hopefully be a proxy to iwatches

2375
01:52:56,420 --> 01:53:00,869
we're into yeast or piche a really soon

2376
01:52:58,920 --> 01:53:03,180
because they've mapped it all out now

2377
01:53:00,869 --> 01:53:06,119
and so they could theoretically brew

2378
01:53:03,180 --> 01:53:07,770
this and that would be that would be

2379
01:53:06,119 --> 01:53:12,210
really wild i think is it's probably a

2380
01:53:07,770 --> 01:53:14,580
very friendly pathway to like mister guy

2381
01:53:12,210 --> 01:53:20,760
i met the codon structure is the same I

2382
01:53:14,579 --> 01:53:23,029
bet it would port real easily there you

2383
01:53:20,760 --> 01:53:25,560
go your next beer is gonna be a boomer

2384
01:53:23,029 --> 01:53:28,579
explain the difference between RNA to

2385
01:53:25,560 --> 01:53:31,410
DNA to these people who don't know it oh

2386
01:53:28,579 --> 01:53:33,300
so so DNA's you have to imagine DNA is

2387
01:53:31,409 --> 01:53:35,908
like your hard drive so all your

2388
01:53:33,300 --> 01:53:36,958
programs are on there but if your

2389
01:53:35,908 --> 01:53:38,248
we need to be running one of the

2390
01:53:36,958 --> 01:53:39,809
programs excessively you might see in

2391
01:53:38,248 --> 01:53:46,349
your task manager was like taking up all

2392
01:53:39,809 --> 01:53:47,998
your CEP you may RNA is a Morse is which

2393
01:53:46,349 --> 01:53:50,130
programs on the genome are actually

2394
01:53:47,998 --> 01:53:51,569
getting expressed or getting run and so

2395
01:53:50,130 --> 01:53:53,279
when you measure RNA loads you get a

2396
01:53:51,569 --> 01:53:55,649
little bit more information about okay

2397
01:53:53,279 --> 01:54:00,118
how actively expresses this gene is it

2398
01:53:55,649 --> 01:54:01,948
completely making probably any compound

2399
01:54:00,118 --> 01:54:03,688
or are the RNA levels through the roof

2400
01:54:01,948 --> 01:54:06,089
in which case it may be in fact making

2401
01:54:03,689 --> 01:54:15,300
it may be much higher percent express

2402
01:54:06,090 --> 01:54:17,489
compound does that make sense yeah that

2403
01:54:15,300 --> 01:54:19,800
definitely challenges otherwise yeah

2404
01:54:17,488 --> 01:54:21,268
it's a little um it's a it's designed to

2405
01:54:19,800 --> 01:54:22,860
be ephemeral it's designed to break down

2406
01:54:21,269 --> 01:54:24,599
quickly because you want these programs

2407
01:54:22,859 --> 01:54:26,998
to get run and then the molecule to get

2408
01:54:24,599 --> 01:54:30,719
eaten up pretty quickly and so it does

2409
01:54:26,998 --> 01:54:32,368
the tripping them on tissue and bring it

2410
01:54:30,719 --> 01:54:33,599
to a lab look at RNA they're gonna be

2411
01:54:32,368 --> 01:54:35,368
asking a lot of questions have I had to

2412
01:54:33,599 --> 01:54:37,199
store it did you put it on dry ice and

2413
01:54:35,368 --> 01:54:39,719
how cold was it because the RNA is a

2414
01:54:37,198 --> 01:54:43,279
ticking time-bomb and we want to make

2415
01:54:39,719 --> 01:54:46,408
sure we're reading something as close to

2416
01:54:43,279 --> 01:54:49,078
a question that you're trying to add

2417
01:54:46,408 --> 01:54:50,549
note with shipped in FedEx and heated up

2418
01:54:49,078 --> 01:54:52,139
to you know fifty degrees on a loading

2419
01:54:50,550 --> 01:54:54,869
dock that'll probably destroy all the

2420
01:54:52,139 --> 01:54:56,909
RNA or at least a great it's a bit so it

2421
01:54:54,868 --> 01:55:01,049
is important if you want to do RNA stuff

2422
01:54:56,908 --> 01:55:08,069
to have schools that can go because but

2423
01:55:01,050 --> 01:55:10,079
era not have any those questions very

2424
01:55:08,069 --> 01:55:12,688
interesting for certain I think we lost

2425
01:55:10,078 --> 01:55:14,429
Johnny be he's off for the day and I

2426
01:55:12,689 --> 01:55:16,949
think we might have lost Indra too he

2427
01:55:14,429 --> 01:55:19,408
said he was off to the Santa Rosa High

2428
01:55:16,948 --> 01:55:21,029
Times Cannabis Cup I literally thought

2429
01:55:19,408 --> 01:55:24,408
when he texted me that I was like wow

2430
01:55:21,029 --> 01:55:30,448
they're still throwing cannabis cups

2431
01:55:24,408 --> 01:55:32,458
it's like am a lot of focus and time and

2432
01:55:30,448 --> 01:55:35,098
energy that people put into cannabis

2433
01:55:32,458 --> 01:55:38,368
cups to sort of build that brand to

2434
01:55:35,099 --> 01:55:40,439
build that name it's always apparently

2435
01:55:38,368 --> 01:55:42,179
for the patient's I I beg you high times

2436
01:55:40,439 --> 01:55:43,800
probably hire some patients to do

2437
01:55:42,179 --> 01:55:45,418
judging though I think that that would

2438
01:55:43,800 --> 01:55:47,668
probably be a good thing I hope that

2439
01:55:45,418 --> 01:55:49,779
they do if they don't some of these cups

2440
01:55:47,668 --> 01:55:52,139
you know your it's all for the patients

2441
01:55:49,779 --> 01:55:54,759
might as well get them to be the judges

2442
01:55:52,139 --> 01:55:56,859
then at least in in the least they get

2443
01:55:54,760 --> 01:56:00,280
access to the medicine after it's been

2444
01:55:56,859 --> 01:56:02,618
tested and proven clean I suppose I had

2445
01:56:00,279 --> 01:56:04,448
invited Alec from SC Labs in today but

2446
01:56:02,618 --> 01:56:07,569
he was also busy hopefully we'll get him

2447
01:56:04,448 --> 01:56:09,339
in next week to uh to share in the

2448
01:56:07,569 --> 01:56:12,279
conversation with us he still is good

2449
01:56:09,340 --> 01:56:15,969
for some good convo those guys at SC

2450
01:56:12,279 --> 01:56:19,719
Labs they're doing some good things down

2451
01:56:15,969 --> 01:56:24,189
in California yeah I think they do most

2452
01:56:19,719 --> 01:56:26,948
of the tests before they come yeah thank

2453
01:56:24,189 --> 01:56:30,158
you a huge bunch of testing done in a

2454
01:56:26,948 --> 01:56:32,738
very short period of time that a lot of

2455
01:56:30,158 --> 01:56:34,960
people's livelihoods are connected it is

2456
01:56:32,738 --> 01:56:36,848
also well because they're choosing to

2457
01:56:34,960 --> 01:56:38,889
right they're choosing to make that

2458
01:56:36,849 --> 01:56:41,139
their platform to create their

2459
01:56:38,889 --> 01:56:43,000
livelihood whereas surely you could

2460
01:56:41,139 --> 01:56:45,730
create a livelihood without the High

2461
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:48,880
Times Cannabis Cup it's got to be able

2462
01:56:45,729 --> 01:56:50,439
to be possible as all I'm saying part of

2463
01:56:48,880 --> 01:56:53,440
it is just the pride of you know

2464
01:56:50,439 --> 01:56:54,759
competition and I think egos a big part

2465
01:56:53,439 --> 01:56:56,888
of it for sure but I think it's

2466
01:56:54,760 --> 01:56:58,480
definitely connected to monetary gain as

2467
01:56:56,889 --> 01:57:00,368
well not that I'm judging those two

2468
01:56:58,479 --> 01:57:03,519
things we all have egos and we all want

2469
01:57:00,368 --> 01:57:04,569
to make money I'm just I've never been

2470
01:57:03,520 --> 01:57:08,739
into it myself

2471
01:57:04,569 --> 01:57:10,599
I'm not I I need to help the cool thing

2472
01:57:08,738 --> 01:57:13,419
mark and you know this because we know

2473
01:57:10,599 --> 01:57:15,639
the same people I mean people like Cuban

2474
01:57:13,420 --> 01:57:17,500
and jibs are the nicest people in the

2475
01:57:15,639 --> 01:57:18,489
world and you can totally approach them

2476
01:57:17,500 --> 01:57:21,010
at the event

2477
01:57:18,488 --> 01:57:23,500
oh yeah you don't have to be well-known

2478
01:57:21,010 --> 01:57:26,230
or well respected you could just be some

2479
01:57:23,500 --> 01:57:28,779
kid who's really just watched some

2480
01:57:26,229 --> 01:57:31,209
YouTube videos or just heard about these

2481
01:57:28,779 --> 01:57:33,578
people and now you can totally like walk

2482
01:57:31,210 --> 01:57:35,800
up and you know shake their hand and

2483
01:57:33,578 --> 01:57:37,479
yeah they want you know I always I

2484
01:57:35,800 --> 01:57:40,570
always liked that about the cup I went

2485
01:57:37,479 --> 01:57:42,129
since 95 and although I very rarely like

2486
01:57:40,569 --> 01:57:43,599
the only part of it that left a bad

2487
01:57:42,130 --> 01:57:45,460
taste in my mouth was like the

2488
01:57:43,599 --> 01:57:47,319
competition part of it it just it was

2489
01:57:45,460 --> 01:57:49,630
always seem so cheesy and it was just

2490
01:57:47,319 --> 01:57:51,908
like compared to the actual cup which

2491
01:57:49,630 --> 01:57:53,889
was like this is an awesome area for

2492
01:57:51,908 --> 01:57:55,719
people to come and meet this was also

2493
01:57:53,889 --> 01:57:56,980
way before the you know the internet

2494
01:57:55,719 --> 01:57:58,448
where you could just kind of get in

2495
01:57:56,979 --> 01:58:00,609
touch with any of these people now if

2496
01:57:58,448 --> 01:58:03,159
you wanted to just be a Instagram or

2497
01:58:00,609 --> 01:58:04,899
Twitter or Facebook or YouTube

2498
01:58:03,159 --> 01:58:06,840
in the comment section but this was

2499
01:58:04,899 --> 01:58:08,589
before all that where literally you

2500
01:58:06,840 --> 01:58:10,539
literally had to fly to Amsterdam

2501
01:58:08,590 --> 01:58:13,239
because that was the only place it was

2502
01:58:10,539 --> 01:58:15,489
happening and that's where everyone's

2503
01:58:13,239 --> 01:58:18,760
sort of it was a magical time the mid

2504
01:58:15,489 --> 01:58:20,949
90s to the late 90s and Amsterdam and

2505
01:58:18,760 --> 01:58:23,380
I'm sure prior to that you know I'm sure

2506
01:58:20,949 --> 01:58:25,720
Sam has some unique stories us he saw it

2507
01:58:23,380 --> 01:58:28,840
all unfolding and happening there as he

2508
01:58:25,720 --> 01:58:34,329
was one of the huge catalysts and sparks

2509
01:58:28,840 --> 01:58:38,770
in in in making it happen I don't think

2510
01:58:34,329 --> 01:58:42,159
it's a coincidence Sam but you move to

2511
01:58:38,770 --> 01:58:45,430
answer them well and I did win the first

2512
01:58:42,159 --> 01:58:49,359
High Times Cannabis Cup and I remember

2513
01:58:45,430 --> 01:58:52,600
it was mine of Rob's idea which was

2514
01:58:49,359 --> 01:58:54,460
shared with Steve Haggard they created

2515
01:58:52,600 --> 01:58:58,329
the first right I'm scared of this

2516
01:58:54,460 --> 01:59:00,069
compass you know a lot of people had you

2517
01:58:58,329 --> 01:59:06,130
know complaints about the cupboard but

2518
01:59:00,069 --> 01:59:10,119
the bottom line is that he helped

2519
01:59:06,130 --> 01:59:13,260
cannabis in the different ways even

2520
01:59:10,119 --> 01:59:18,489
though you know they were just the

2521
01:59:13,260 --> 01:59:21,300
Playboy centerfolds equivalent of yeah I

2522
01:59:18,489 --> 01:59:27,460
mean high times magazine was you know

2523
01:59:21,300 --> 01:59:29,350
pop for porn you know but I still all in

2524
01:59:27,460 --> 01:59:31,359
all really enjoyed myself at those

2525
01:59:29,350 --> 01:59:34,210
things because I met so many interesting

2526
01:59:31,359 --> 01:59:36,639
people who really loved cannabis I mean

2527
01:59:34,210 --> 01:59:39,069
that's what the most interesting thing

2528
01:59:36,640 --> 01:59:40,680
was for me you know I mean it's where I

2529
01:59:39,069 --> 01:59:43,719
met you

2530
01:59:40,680 --> 01:59:45,310
III agree and again I think it goes back

2531
01:59:43,720 --> 01:59:47,680
to what I was saying about just being

2532
01:59:45,310 --> 01:59:50,440
able to approach someone that you may

2533
01:59:47,680 --> 01:59:53,110
only know from watching their internet

2534
01:59:50,439 --> 01:59:54,819
video and you're like wow that's Cuban

2535
01:59:53,109 --> 01:59:57,460
grower over there he looks just the same

2536
01:59:54,819 --> 01:59:59,710
like he does on his thing I can just

2537
01:59:57,460 --> 02:00:02,680
walk right up and say hi yes so those

2538
01:59:59,710 --> 02:00:06,399
types of interactions and yeah I've met

2539
02:00:02,680 --> 02:00:09,010
certainly I met a bunch of folks last

2540
02:00:06,399 --> 02:00:14,379
time I was really surprised at the

2541
02:00:09,010 --> 02:00:16,840
Emerald cup at the amount of product

2542
02:00:14,380 --> 02:00:18,609
that actually is transacted at that one

2543
02:00:16,840 --> 02:00:21,369
interesting because it seems like a lot

2544
02:00:18,609 --> 02:00:24,039
of growers from the Northern California

2545
02:00:21,369 --> 02:00:27,189
area actually you know barter trades

2546
02:00:24,039 --> 02:00:30,069
with whatever you know there's just huge

2547
02:00:27,189 --> 02:00:32,049
amounts huge sacks of weed being you

2548
02:00:30,069 --> 02:00:34,299
know taken back and forth all over the

2549
02:00:32,050 --> 02:00:37,180
place I know one of the issues with the

2550
02:00:34,300 --> 02:00:39,579
cup has parentally been where do people

2551
02:00:37,180 --> 02:00:41,380
consume where are the safe consumption

2552
02:00:39,579 --> 02:00:42,909
areas and where can people consume

2553
02:00:41,380 --> 02:00:45,150
because you have to have a special

2554
02:00:42,909 --> 02:00:47,229
bracelet to get in there and the

2555
02:00:45,149 --> 02:00:50,229
municipality wherever you're having it

2556
02:00:47,229 --> 02:00:52,809
whether it's in San Bernardino or Santa

2557
02:00:50,229 --> 02:00:55,299
Rosa which always seems to be a really

2558
02:00:52,810 --> 02:00:57,700
cool venue for it at the County

2559
02:00:55,300 --> 02:00:59,440
Fairgrounds there they seem to really

2560
02:00:57,699 --> 02:01:02,679
have it down I've been to several cups

2561
02:00:59,439 --> 02:01:05,169
there but tell you the truth like you

2562
02:01:02,680 --> 02:01:08,500
said I think the real differentiator is

2563
02:01:05,170 --> 02:01:11,470
not necessarily the event itself it's

2564
02:01:08,500 --> 02:01:13,149
the people that show up and the

2565
02:01:11,470 --> 02:01:14,860
interaction that you have with the

2566
02:01:13,149 --> 02:01:15,399
people that go that's what it's all

2567
02:01:14,859 --> 02:01:19,329
about

2568
02:01:15,399 --> 02:01:22,750
so it's for the people for the people by

2569
02:01:19,329 --> 02:01:24,309
the people lead the people absolutely I

2570
02:01:22,750 --> 02:01:25,989
would love to check out the Emerald cup

2571
02:01:24,310 --> 02:01:28,600
it seems like a pretty good event lots

2572
02:01:25,989 --> 02:01:31,059
of good folks I just one of these days

2573
02:01:28,600 --> 02:01:33,190
I've got my what's your status on being

2574
02:01:31,060 --> 02:01:35,110
able to come down south here I could

2575
02:01:33,189 --> 02:01:37,719
probably do it I could probably get my

2576
02:01:35,109 --> 02:01:39,939
waiver now I'm all pardoned my record is

2577
02:01:37,720 --> 02:01:42,100
pardoned in Canada I've got a whole

2578
02:01:39,939 --> 02:01:44,529
folder full of my waivers and not to

2579
02:01:42,100 --> 02:01:47,560
draw the quite the conversation into

2580
02:01:44,529 --> 02:01:50,259
politics but from someone who paid very

2581
02:01:47,560 --> 02:01:53,170
little attention to politics it just

2582
02:01:50,260 --> 02:01:55,840
seemed like it was safer under the last

2583
02:01:53,170 --> 02:01:59,680
regime to travel down to the US then it

2584
02:01:55,840 --> 02:02:02,980
potentially is today now especially with

2585
02:01:59,680 --> 02:02:06,670
now now I guess Trudeau's fired back

2586
02:02:02,979 --> 02:02:09,279
with some tariffs on u.s. products since

2587
02:02:06,670 --> 02:02:11,470
Trump did it to us for I think there

2588
02:02:09,279 --> 02:02:14,590
Stevo are double bags on their nerves

2589
02:02:11,470 --> 02:02:16,900
our like what's going on here what's

2590
02:02:14,590 --> 02:02:20,409
that our bubble bags on their tariffs

2591
02:02:16,899 --> 02:02:29,319
yeah they're like they cost $900 a set

2592
02:02:20,409 --> 02:02:30,250
now and I get and I get 200 I mean hey

2593
02:02:29,319 --> 02:02:34,359
I'm paying two bucks

2594
02:02:30,250 --> 02:02:37,600
a leader for gas right now so it's the

2595
02:02:34,359 --> 02:02:43,630
world is a crazy place right now so we

2596
02:02:37,600 --> 02:02:46,660
paid five five euros under what per

2597
02:02:43,630 --> 02:02:49,989
liter or maybe it's only 370 or

2598
02:02:46,659 --> 02:02:52,239
something but it's crazy more expensive

2599
02:02:49,989 --> 02:02:54,219
the way you pay well I believe that cuz

2600
02:02:52,239 --> 02:02:58,210
I remember being in Paris in the late

2601
02:02:54,220 --> 02:03:00,850
eighties in like 89 and thinking wow gas

2602
02:02:58,210 --> 02:03:03,939
was like I think it was between $1 and

2603
02:03:00,850 --> 02:03:06,370
$2 a leader like it was insane it cost

2604
02:03:03,939 --> 02:03:08,679
my friend's dad so much money to fill up

2605
02:03:06,369 --> 02:03:10,779
his Mercedes it was just like from my

2606
02:03:08,680 --> 02:03:13,570
perspective because back in the 80s here

2607
02:03:10,779 --> 02:03:15,609
gas was just obviously a lot cheaper a

2608
02:03:13,569 --> 02:03:18,039
full tank of gas certainly wasn't like

2609
02:03:15,609 --> 02:03:20,319
ninety to a hundred dollars whereas now

2610
02:03:18,039 --> 02:03:21,659
it's more like two hundred dollars it's

2611
02:03:20,319 --> 02:03:26,409
kind of crazy

2612
02:03:21,659 --> 02:03:28,210
just what getting old is all about so we

2613
02:03:26,409 --> 02:03:30,359
can complain I remember when the bus

2614
02:03:28,210 --> 02:03:35,590
cost a nickel

2615
02:03:30,359 --> 02:03:39,549
I remember amazed to pay you to get off

2616
02:03:35,590 --> 02:03:43,239
the bus yeah you were probably on lower

2617
02:03:39,550 --> 02:03:45,220
jail yeah that was jail exactly that's

2618
02:03:43,239 --> 02:03:49,510
that that's the punchline I was gonna

2619
02:03:45,220 --> 02:03:51,520
feel so much pain constantly you know

2620
02:03:49,510 --> 02:03:54,340
all the numb spots on your body from all

2621
02:03:51,520 --> 02:03:56,080
the different breaks Wow dude you broke

2622
02:03:54,340 --> 02:03:59,619
like every bone in your body

2623
02:03:56,079 --> 02:04:02,260
oh yeah I know but see that's for me

2624
02:03:59,619 --> 02:04:04,809
before eight this year and the things

2625
02:04:02,260 --> 02:04:07,329
that I just I can't believe that I and

2626
02:04:04,810 --> 02:04:09,280
I'm sore where I am still well dude

2627
02:04:07,329 --> 02:04:10,989
didn't you like dislocate both your legs

2628
02:04:09,279 --> 02:04:14,229
when you crashed your motorcycle

2629
02:04:10,989 --> 02:04:16,659
both legs both shoulders broken neck on

2630
02:04:14,229 --> 02:04:18,639
that one a broken wrist you must just

2631
02:04:16,659 --> 02:04:22,090
you must have been like a floppy doll

2632
02:04:18,640 --> 02:04:24,369
just laying there unable to move um I

2633
02:04:22,090 --> 02:04:25,510
actually tried to sit up cuz it knocked

2634
02:04:24,369 --> 02:04:27,460
the wind out of me too

2635
02:04:25,510 --> 02:04:30,670
my buddy was behind me in his truck and

2636
02:04:27,460 --> 02:04:32,289
he got out and he just made he just kept

2637
02:04:30,670 --> 02:04:33,940
me down he just no no sit down I was

2638
02:04:32,289 --> 02:04:35,680
trying to get up but I was because the

2639
02:04:33,939 --> 02:04:38,139
wind was knocked out of me when I was

2640
02:04:35,680 --> 02:04:39,640
boxing in my young days and when I got

2641
02:04:38,140 --> 02:04:41,250
the wind knocked out of me my boxing

2642
02:04:39,640 --> 02:04:43,860
coach would take my arms

2643
02:04:41,250 --> 02:04:45,329
and go up and down and would ya exercise

2644
02:04:43,859 --> 02:04:47,639
you wants to get your air in there

2645
02:04:45,329 --> 02:04:50,789
quicker and what I did is I went to lift

2646
02:04:47,640 --> 02:04:52,260
my arms to start doing the movement to

2647
02:04:50,789 --> 02:04:55,050
get my lungs moving and my arms were

2648
02:04:52,260 --> 02:04:57,030
just like just my did just scream

2649
02:04:55,050 --> 02:05:01,860
everything screamed in my shoulders that

2650
02:04:57,029 --> 02:05:04,469
was it hurt yeah that's some Evel

2651
02:05:01,859 --> 02:05:06,179
Knievel [ __ ] well you know I was I was

2652
02:05:04,470 --> 02:05:08,909
doing so much painkillers and all that

2653
02:05:06,180 --> 02:05:10,980
back then that it was literally the

2654
02:05:08,909 --> 02:05:13,109
painkillers didn't do nothing to get up

2655
02:05:10,979 --> 02:05:15,089
into a sitting position into my bed on

2656
02:05:13,109 --> 02:05:17,849
the side of it was the most excruciating

2657
02:05:15,090 --> 02:05:20,130
thing I could ever do and then I would

2658
02:05:17,850 --> 02:05:21,840
just basically sniff a nice little line

2659
02:05:20,130 --> 02:05:23,430
of [ __ ] heroin because that would

2660
02:05:21,840 --> 02:05:27,420
knock me out for the day and I did that

2661
02:05:23,430 --> 02:05:30,690
for what a week or two it was heavy

2662
02:05:27,420 --> 02:05:34,340
that's a long time ago I don't do that

2663
02:05:30,689 --> 02:05:39,179
anymore the pain trust me no no I know

2664
02:05:34,340 --> 02:05:41,400
well I love my coconut oil pictures

2665
02:05:39,180 --> 02:05:43,890
moonshine picture with the OG Kush

2666
02:05:41,399 --> 02:05:46,229
knowledge works really good when it

2667
02:05:43,890 --> 02:05:51,710
comes down to pain and it won't kill you

2668
02:05:46,229 --> 02:05:51,709
oh how about that all the time either

2669
02:05:52,189 --> 02:05:57,449
Hilary just testified in to the Senate

2670
02:05:55,409 --> 02:05:59,069
here in Canada which she talked about a

2671
02:05:57,449 --> 02:06:00,569
little bit on the last episode of hash

2672
02:05:59,069 --> 02:06:03,179
Church I'm not sure of how many of you

2673
02:06:00,569 --> 02:06:05,099
guys watched her seven minutes blur but

2674
02:06:03,180 --> 02:06:06,960
she she mentioned in that about the

2675
02:06:05,100 --> 02:06:08,579
brain stem and how that's one of the

2676
02:06:06,960 --> 02:06:10,220
only places where the cannabinoid

2677
02:06:08,579 --> 02:06:12,300
receptors aren't really in this

2678
02:06:10,220 --> 02:06:15,150
concentrated amount whereas there is a

2679
02:06:12,300 --> 02:06:17,610
lot of opioid receptors which is why you

2680
02:06:15,149 --> 02:06:19,559
know fentanyl and heroin and oxycotin

2681
02:06:17,609 --> 02:06:22,739
can kill you because two minutes you

2682
02:06:19,560 --> 02:06:24,990
know it controls your breathing and your

2683
02:06:22,739 --> 02:06:27,659
heart so it was pretty interesting

2684
02:06:24,989 --> 02:06:29,550
concept of why cannabinoids don't have

2685
02:06:27,659 --> 02:06:30,840
that ability to you know slow your

2686
02:06:29,550 --> 02:06:32,760
breath down to the point where you're

2687
02:06:30,840 --> 02:06:35,130
you're dead whereas I can definitely say

2688
02:06:32,760 --> 02:06:37,380
after seeing breeder Steve eat almost 15

2689
02:06:35,130 --> 02:06:39,690
grams of dry sift and in a tray of

2690
02:06:37,380 --> 02:06:41,730
brownies it's actually 30 grams of dry

2691
02:06:39,689 --> 02:06:44,489
sift in the whole tray but he shared it

2692
02:06:41,729 --> 02:06:47,309
with his buddy Wayne dude he was out for

2693
02:06:44,489 --> 02:06:49,559
36 hours and I remember his wife like

2694
02:06:47,310 --> 02:06:50,850
trying to listen for his breath because

2695
02:06:49,560 --> 02:06:53,760
he was so like I bet he could have

2696
02:06:50,850 --> 02:06:54,590
operated on him he was that out on

2697
02:06:53,760 --> 02:06:56,929
edible

2698
02:06:54,590 --> 02:06:58,489
I'm telling you like it was insane

2699
02:06:56,929 --> 02:07:01,010
people it was like and how long do you

2700
02:06:58,488 --> 02:07:04,609
wait right when you're like okay I know

2701
02:07:01,010 --> 02:07:07,579
cannabis can't kill you but he hasn't

2702
02:07:04,609 --> 02:07:10,460
moved in 34 hours like this is beyond

2703
02:07:07,578 --> 02:07:14,439
the sleep this is some next-level [ __ ] a

2704
02:07:10,460 --> 02:07:17,649
mirror under the moon this is no joke

2705
02:07:14,439 --> 02:07:17,649
it's no joke

2706
02:07:17,859 --> 02:07:24,649
Walla tree story yeah I could hit a bong

2707
02:07:22,760 --> 02:07:26,690
right but you know I'm kind of digging

2708
02:07:24,649 --> 02:07:28,719
these two our hash churches we have been

2709
02:07:26,689 --> 02:07:31,069
pumping it out for a couple hours might

2710
02:07:28,719 --> 02:07:32,809
do a bong rip and call it a day unless

2711
02:07:31,069 --> 02:07:35,269
anyone has something in particular they

2712
02:07:32,809 --> 02:07:38,449
want to cover or get into I don't mind

2713
02:07:35,270 --> 02:07:41,480
doing that smoke a little full mount

2714
02:07:38,448 --> 02:07:43,428
hash here it's too bad injury dropped

2715
02:07:41,479 --> 02:07:46,149
off I wanted to ask him about his ex

2716
02:07:43,429 --> 02:07:50,059
tractor a lot of people ask me about

2717
02:07:46,149 --> 02:07:52,339
what's going on I do yeah he keeps me

2718
02:07:50,059 --> 02:07:54,739
updated all the time and I would

2719
02:07:52,340 --> 02:07:57,139
definitely let him share all about it

2720
02:07:54,738 --> 02:08:00,500
next week when he comes on but he's

2721
02:07:57,139 --> 02:08:02,510
definitely he's he's built units he's

2722
02:08:00,500 --> 02:08:04,250
got units built and they're looking

2723
02:08:02,510 --> 02:08:07,520
pretty shiny and new and they're looking

2724
02:08:04,250 --> 02:08:10,158
pretty [ __ ] crazy I obviously am NOT

2725
02:08:07,520 --> 02:08:11,900
a solvent extractor but I'm sure once

2726
02:08:10,158 --> 02:08:13,399
they get out to a group of different

2727
02:08:11,899 --> 02:08:15,348
people people will be able to talk about

2728
02:08:13,399 --> 02:08:18,439
them that's always really the tried and

2729
02:08:15,349 --> 02:08:20,059
trued you know I know that Todd

2730
02:08:18,439 --> 02:08:22,219
McCormick always doubted everything

2731
02:08:20,059 --> 02:08:25,159
Indra said always you know just they

2732
02:08:22,219 --> 02:08:28,399
would get into it really harshly and for

2733
02:08:25,158 --> 02:08:30,529
me before I you know met Indra online

2734
02:08:28,399 --> 02:08:32,269
when I'm through meeting him online

2735
02:08:30,529 --> 02:08:35,059
before I saw him face-to-face you know

2736
02:08:32,270 --> 02:08:36,860
the reason why I had belief in what he

2737
02:08:35,059 --> 02:08:39,349
was doing was because of the defatted

2738
02:08:36,859 --> 02:08:41,509
hemp seed oil that he sent me in the

2739
02:08:39,349 --> 02:08:42,828
mail and you know I had it tested in

2740
02:08:41,510 --> 02:08:45,409
three labs I've told the story many

2741
02:08:42,828 --> 02:08:47,899
times and the protein powder isolate was

2742
02:08:45,408 --> 02:08:49,549
like 10 to 12 percent higher than the

2743
02:08:47,899 --> 02:08:51,259
company that was claiming they had the

2744
02:08:49,550 --> 02:08:54,619
highest protein powder I solute in the

2745
02:08:51,260 --> 02:08:57,199
world I had never seen seed embryos

2746
02:08:54,618 --> 02:09:00,380
intact as he had defatted them without

2747
02:08:57,198 --> 02:09:02,618
actually affecting their structure so it

2748
02:09:00,380 --> 02:09:04,788
wasn't like a seed cake like pressed

2749
02:09:02,618 --> 02:09:06,288
cold-pressed misnomer thing where

2750
02:09:04,788 --> 02:09:07,488
they're heating it up and they're

2751
02:09:06,288 --> 02:09:09,920
pressing it and they're bouncing

2752
02:09:07,488 --> 02:09:11,779
kcon screens and collecting the protein

2753
02:09:09,920 --> 02:09:14,779
powder isolate that way his was just

2754
02:09:11,779 --> 02:09:17,149
like whole embryos it blew me away

2755
02:09:14,779 --> 02:09:18,979
having been invested and involved in the

2756
02:09:17,149 --> 02:09:21,348
hemp industry since you know the early

2757
02:09:18,979 --> 02:09:23,419
90s I had never seen anything like it

2758
02:09:21,349 --> 02:09:25,639
his oil was as gold as gold could be

2759
02:09:23,420 --> 02:09:27,859
which I had only seen when people ran

2760
02:09:25,639 --> 02:09:29,449
through activated charcoal to get rid of

2761
02:09:27,859 --> 02:09:30,078
that green color that you get from the

2762
02:09:29,448 --> 02:09:33,439
coldpressed

2763
02:09:30,078 --> 02:09:35,268
oil from chlorophyll I guess his oil was

2764
02:09:33,439 --> 02:09:38,328
the Golda stive ever seen it was

2765
02:09:35,269 --> 02:09:40,190
unbelievably tasty it stayed like it

2766
02:09:38,328 --> 02:09:43,130
didn't go bad on the Shelf for like an

2767
02:09:40,189 --> 02:09:45,649
insanely long time and so those all

2768
02:09:43,130 --> 02:09:48,679
those things combined had me thinking

2769
02:09:45,649 --> 02:09:51,828
that that ender is the real deal that if

2770
02:09:48,679 --> 02:09:54,710
he could do that to hemp seed embryos

2771
02:09:51,828 --> 02:09:58,248
then he should be able to do that to all

2772
02:09:54,710 --> 02:10:01,279
sorts of oil and fat containing seeds

2773
02:09:58,248 --> 02:10:04,359
and and resin type producing plants so

2774
02:10:01,279 --> 02:10:09,550
I'm gonna have that bong right now d

2775
02:10:04,359 --> 02:10:12,679
yeah I just know that you know again my

2776
02:10:09,550 --> 02:10:17,538
client and friend him he watches hash

2777
02:10:12,679 --> 02:10:19,460
Church was the first group to get the

2778
02:10:17,538 --> 02:10:21,710
distractor and they actually couldn't

2779
02:10:19,460 --> 02:10:25,069
use it as is I guess it was like before

2780
02:10:21,710 --> 02:10:27,198
was yeah they got the old extractor yeah

2781
02:10:25,069 --> 02:10:30,408
I think it was both it wasn't it was

2782
02:10:27,198 --> 02:10:32,868
like fully certified or whatever

2783
02:10:30,408 --> 02:10:34,748
ratified or whatever wasn't wasn't ready

2784
02:10:32,868 --> 02:10:36,920
for primetime yeah it was just a

2785
02:10:34,748 --> 02:10:39,469
pre-production prototype if you will

2786
02:10:36,920 --> 02:10:41,449
right but they ended up having to switch

2787
02:10:39,469 --> 02:10:43,189
out their extractor and you're using a

2788
02:10:41,448 --> 02:10:45,828
different one so I don't know where the

2789
02:10:43,189 --> 02:10:49,189
where Danny's extractor is if that's

2790
02:10:45,828 --> 02:10:53,029
being revived you know it injures been

2791
02:10:49,189 --> 02:10:55,069
really nice to keep me informed yeah I

2792
02:10:53,029 --> 02:10:57,469
probably get the same actually you get

2793
02:10:55,069 --> 02:11:01,308
mark yeah a bunch of different pictures

2794
02:10:57,469 --> 02:11:03,408
of a shiny big extractor in the factory

2795
02:11:01,309 --> 02:11:05,179
and everything I just don't know if any

2796
02:11:03,408 --> 02:11:07,698
of them are actually out there at use

2797
02:11:05,179 --> 02:11:10,190
and it'd be great to get an update from

2798
02:11:07,698 --> 02:11:12,288
John and see where where things are on

2799
02:11:10,189 --> 02:11:14,808
that because yeah well he'll come update

2800
02:11:12,288 --> 02:11:16,880
us next week yeah that's awesome it's

2801
02:11:14,809 --> 02:11:20,230
awesome that he can give that update to

2802
02:11:16,880 --> 02:11:22,180
you know yep

2803
02:11:20,229 --> 02:11:24,339
because a lot of people ask me about it

2804
02:11:22,180 --> 02:11:26,409
all the time and I don't know what to

2805
02:11:24,340 --> 02:11:28,690
say I'd say well I know the one didn't

2806
02:11:26,409 --> 02:11:30,550
work out for Danny and those guys

2807
02:11:28,689 --> 02:11:33,479
akarova but that doesn't mean that they

2808
02:11:30,550 --> 02:11:36,070
are not working and out there today

2809
02:11:33,479 --> 02:11:40,149
functioning I just don't know that they

2810
02:11:36,069 --> 02:11:42,639
are not well we'll get him to come and

2811
02:11:40,149 --> 02:11:44,439
give us an update yeah that would be

2812
02:11:42,640 --> 02:11:46,630
great I know that there was like a lot

2813
02:11:44,439 --> 02:11:50,019
of you know talked back and forth and

2814
02:11:46,630 --> 02:11:52,930
there was a picture of a extractor that

2815
02:11:50,020 --> 02:11:55,060
had imploded and some people thought it

2816
02:11:52,930 --> 02:11:57,730
was Andrews extractor but then Indra

2817
02:11:55,060 --> 02:12:00,130
kind of fought back and said no that's

2818
02:11:57,729 --> 02:12:02,709
not my extractor and you guys are all

2819
02:12:00,130 --> 02:12:08,730
bunch of dumb shits haha that sounds

2820
02:12:02,710 --> 02:12:12,189
like Indra yeah the nicest sort of

2821
02:12:08,729 --> 02:12:15,488
approach sometimes on internet yeah

2822
02:12:12,189 --> 02:12:17,439
agree I've felt the same thing I've told

2823
02:12:15,488 --> 02:12:19,689
him many times you gotta pull back it

2824
02:12:17,439 --> 02:12:21,719
takes time to learn about how to be on

2825
02:12:19,689 --> 02:12:25,329
the internet sometimes and I've had

2826
02:12:21,720 --> 02:12:27,010
friends over the years my one friend who

2827
02:12:25,329 --> 02:12:28,119
up I won't even mention his name because

2828
02:12:27,010 --> 02:12:30,190
I don't want to call him out but he's

2829
02:12:28,119 --> 02:12:31,930
just like the nicest person in person

2830
02:12:30,189 --> 02:12:33,849
and then I invited him onto my website

2831
02:12:31,930 --> 02:12:35,980
years ago and he just was like this

2832
02:12:33,850 --> 02:12:37,750
troll that was just attacking everyone

2833
02:12:35,979 --> 02:12:39,459
and I was like dude like I don't even

2834
02:12:37,750 --> 02:12:41,529
know if I can follow you anymore like

2835
02:12:39,460 --> 02:12:44,050
you were just like trolling incessantly

2836
02:12:41,529 --> 02:12:46,300
that's weird because that's not who you

2837
02:12:44,050 --> 02:12:48,340
are in real life but I guess it goes

2838
02:12:46,300 --> 02:12:50,980
back to you know like a South Park

2839
02:12:48,340 --> 02:12:52,750
episode where where Stan's dad becomes

2840
02:12:50,979 --> 02:12:55,149
the ultra troll if you guys remember

2841
02:12:52,750 --> 02:12:56,619
that episode where and people like oh he

2842
02:12:55,149 --> 02:12:57,789
must be the most miserable man in the

2843
02:12:56,619 --> 02:13:00,039
world and then they show him like

2844
02:12:57,789 --> 02:13:02,500
skipping down the road like he's just as

2845
02:13:00,039 --> 02:13:05,409
happy as happy can be I guess cuz he

2846
02:13:02,500 --> 02:13:07,720
gets all his aggression control trolling

2847
02:13:05,409 --> 02:13:10,449
out in the in the internet world that

2848
02:13:07,720 --> 02:13:11,949
kind of funny nonetheless made me laugh

2849
02:13:10,449 --> 02:13:14,679
if you haven't seen that South Park

2850
02:13:11,949 --> 02:13:16,269
episode check it out it's it's a good

2851
02:13:14,680 --> 02:13:21,820
one it's actually a couple episodes I

2852
02:13:16,270 --> 02:13:26,890
believe or he's the internet troll so

2853
02:13:21,819 --> 02:13:29,639
here's a topic but what Mark motors

2854
02:13:26,890 --> 02:13:33,300
after the FDA there's an interesting

2855
02:13:29,640 --> 02:13:36,210
group called the pineapple pond that

2856
02:13:33,300 --> 02:13:41,100
has been crypto funding a bunch of

2857
02:13:36,210 --> 02:13:44,430
different projects and they raid quota

2858
02:13:41,100 --> 02:13:47,150
from maps to get MDMA and maybe even

2859
02:13:44,430 --> 02:13:49,350
Silas in the South Simon through the FDA

2860
02:13:47,149 --> 02:13:49,829
Wow they are the ones that raise that

2861
02:13:49,350 --> 02:13:52,200
money

2862
02:13:49,829 --> 02:13:53,880
yeah they raised it for maps it was a

2863
02:13:52,199 --> 02:13:58,199
bit of it I think there was a matching

2864
02:13:53,880 --> 02:14:01,079
fund got it but it ended up being like

2865
02:13:58,199 --> 02:14:02,369
an eight million dollar fund which I

2866
02:14:01,079 --> 02:14:05,789
think you can see in this link I'm the

2867
02:14:02,369 --> 02:14:08,819
UH I put on the chat room there oh and

2868
02:14:05,789 --> 02:14:12,869
uh that in their estimating that might

2869
02:14:08,819 --> 02:14:15,389
be enough to actively praying it through

2870
02:14:12,869 --> 02:14:16,710
the phase three study so I'm kind of

2871
02:14:15,390 --> 02:14:20,100
curious to where this is gonna go just

2872
02:14:16,710 --> 02:14:21,359
because I don't know my I know I'm not

2873
02:14:20,100 --> 02:14:22,980
really well-read on the patent

2874
02:14:21,359 --> 02:14:24,599
background of that molecule but it's a

2875
02:14:22,979 --> 02:14:27,209
pretty old one so imagine if there were

2876
02:14:24,600 --> 02:14:29,970
eight and yeah that's open our open our

2877
02:14:27,210 --> 02:14:32,789
and I think be a full safety profile

2878
02:14:29,970 --> 02:14:35,900
already developed on it so it's like

2879
02:14:32,789 --> 02:14:38,430
something that they'd have to like do a

2880
02:14:35,899 --> 02:14:41,399
not an orphan drug thing but there's a

2881
02:14:38,430 --> 02:14:43,829
way of reapplying it's already in the so

2882
02:14:41,399 --> 02:14:47,279
called orange book the orange book is

2883
02:14:43,829 --> 02:14:49,229
basically the book of active ingredients

2884
02:14:47,279 --> 02:14:51,090
that I already have FDA approval from

2885
02:14:49,229 --> 02:14:53,459
which you can draw from to make

2886
02:14:51,090 --> 02:14:57,449
commercial medicines so it's an sort of

2887
02:14:53,460 --> 02:15:01,319
the generic bucket really outside of it

2888
02:14:57,449 --> 02:15:02,789
scheduling with a DEA you know I bet

2889
02:15:01,319 --> 02:15:04,799
it's a lower schedule than cannabis

2890
02:15:02,789 --> 02:15:07,649
right now isn't it it is it's scheduled

2891
02:15:04,800 --> 02:15:09,480
to yeah you know how could be a licensed

2892
02:15:07,649 --> 02:15:12,239
pharmaceutical manufacturer with a

2893
02:15:09,479 --> 02:15:15,839
schedule to license to be able to make

2894
02:15:12,239 --> 02:15:19,340
it but you know [ __ ] it it's like

2895
02:15:15,840 --> 02:15:22,500
[ __ ] ritalin and adderal I mean I

2896
02:15:19,340 --> 02:15:25,230
there's a lot of in feta means and you

2897
02:15:22,500 --> 02:15:27,989
know the docket of people these days so

2898
02:15:25,229 --> 02:15:35,519
what the dark friend I thought math apps

2899
02:15:27,989 --> 02:15:37,289
owned MD eight or MMD a social Shasta

2900
02:15:35,520 --> 02:15:42,240
shelgon was the one who discovered it

2901
02:15:37,289 --> 02:15:44,819
I'm pretty sure sure no path for it okay

2902
02:15:42,239 --> 02:15:46,479
okay it was discovered a real long time

2903
02:15:44,819 --> 02:15:48,789
ago so what did he do read

2904
02:15:46,479 --> 02:15:52,179
discover it no he found the application

2905
02:15:48,789 --> 02:15:53,979
for it so it was an application and I

2906
02:15:52,180 --> 02:15:56,590
think when it was first discovered mark

2907
02:15:53,979 --> 02:15:58,269
it was discovered as a racemic mixture

2908
02:15:56,590 --> 02:16:01,810
so both the right hand and left hand

2909
02:15:58,270 --> 02:16:05,020
version Geoghan actually made the you

2910
02:16:01,810 --> 02:16:07,840
know took and made separated the right

2911
02:16:05,020 --> 02:16:09,790
from the left hand versions but yeah a

2912
02:16:07,840 --> 02:16:13,329
composition a matter where was already

2913
02:16:09,789 --> 02:16:16,300
known so these were just application you

2914
02:16:13,329 --> 02:16:20,170
know utility patents on the utility of

2915
02:16:16,300 --> 02:16:23,409
these molecules interesting and they

2916
02:16:20,170 --> 02:16:26,199
also claimed a myriad of analogs around

2917
02:16:23,409 --> 02:16:28,389
them so not just the active compounds

2918
02:16:26,199 --> 02:16:30,639
themselves but then what they'll do is

2919
02:16:28,390 --> 02:16:32,860
they'll claim say like there's a methyl

2920
02:16:30,640 --> 02:16:35,260
group in the four position well they'll

2921
02:16:32,860 --> 02:16:37,329
claim an ethyl group they'll also claim

2922
02:16:35,260 --> 02:16:40,300
a propyl group and a butyl group I mean

2923
02:16:37,329 --> 02:16:42,218
they'll blow it out to any group that

2924
02:16:40,299 --> 02:16:44,859
can possibly exist there that they can

2925
02:16:42,218 --> 02:16:48,250
make synthetically and you know one of

2926
02:16:44,860 --> 02:16:50,829
you know Shogun's obvious you know sort

2927
02:16:48,250 --> 02:16:53,200
of claimed the famous was all of the

2928
02:16:50,829 --> 02:16:55,599
analog work that he did around those

2929
02:16:53,200 --> 02:16:58,929
nucleus a lot of those compounds were

2930
02:16:55,599 --> 02:17:01,690
were made by a very sort of routine

2931
02:16:58,929 --> 02:17:03,700
synthesis where he just started with a

2932
02:17:01,690 --> 02:17:05,319
different starting material and ended up

2933
02:17:03,700 --> 02:17:07,360
with a different products because of the

2934
02:17:05,319 --> 02:17:09,039
starting material had a different group

2935
02:17:07,360 --> 02:17:11,409
there and would bring in through the

2936
02:17:09,040 --> 02:17:13,719
same synthesis and then the great

2937
02:17:11,409 --> 02:17:16,929
obviously the Shogun would actually take

2938
02:17:13,718 --> 02:17:19,239
it with his wife and him you know write

2939
02:17:16,929 --> 02:17:21,239
down comments and a diary and let

2940
02:17:19,239 --> 02:17:25,569
everyone know what kind of effects these

2941
02:17:21,239 --> 02:17:27,519
different substituents would have and

2942
02:17:25,569 --> 02:17:31,360
really develop his own structure

2943
02:17:27,519 --> 02:17:39,550
activity relationship so it's cool cool

2944
02:17:31,360 --> 02:17:41,409
stuff can't do that anymore well we have

2945
02:17:39,549 --> 02:17:43,299
been dabbling in the same field and we

2946
02:17:41,409 --> 02:17:45,700
recently got a grant from a

2947
02:17:43,299 --> 02:17:50,979
cryptocurrency called - that is gonna

2948
02:17:45,700 --> 02:17:52,480
fund a law spin eels dance so we're

2949
02:17:50,979 --> 02:17:54,579
gonna see where that goes it should be

2950
02:17:52,479 --> 02:17:56,409
in the next five months or so we'll be

2951
02:17:54,579 --> 02:17:59,319
performing that work and putting all the

2952
02:17:56,409 --> 02:18:00,218
public but - is doing this because they

2953
02:17:59,319 --> 02:18:04,439
are trying to

2954
02:18:00,218 --> 02:18:07,718
get into the cannabis banking industry

2955
02:18:04,439 --> 02:18:09,159
feels kind of misled transaction time in

2956
02:18:07,718 --> 02:18:10,988
Bitcoin is like 10 minutes so it doesn't

2957
02:18:09,159 --> 02:18:13,808
really work into dispensary but - has

2958
02:18:10,988 --> 02:18:17,349
these sub second transaction speeds that

2959
02:18:13,808 --> 02:18:21,278
can probably work for a sale so they're

2960
02:18:17,349 --> 02:18:23,380
gonna be before meeting and we'll have a

2961
02:18:21,279 --> 02:18:25,149
crypto track there so folks can go and

2962
02:18:23,379 --> 02:18:27,429
learn more about how that that

2963
02:18:25,148 --> 02:18:29,728
currencies how can potentially help the

2964
02:18:27,429 --> 02:18:32,379
banking problems we've got done here

2965
02:18:29,728 --> 02:18:38,829
the banking problems easier up in Canada

2966
02:18:32,379 --> 02:18:40,659
now you guys I mean yes and no it still

2967
02:18:38,829 --> 02:18:42,549
hasn't opened up completely one of the

2968
02:18:40,659 --> 02:18:46,000
largest banks like the Royal Bank of

2969
02:18:42,549 --> 02:18:48,699
Canada has an intimate American banking

2970
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:51,459
relationships so they have stayed away

2971
02:18:48,700 --> 02:18:53,409
from it completely and I think Bank of

2972
02:18:51,459 --> 02:18:55,928
Montreal had also been staying away from

2973
02:18:53,409 --> 02:18:57,789
it recently until recently where they

2974
02:18:55,929 --> 02:18:59,679
just released a bunch of funds they're

2975
02:18:57,790 --> 02:19:03,309
opening up their doors now to cannabis

2976
02:18:59,679 --> 02:19:04,988
business I believe TD Bank does it but

2977
02:19:03,308 --> 02:19:06,968
when I say cannabis business is really

2978
02:19:04,988 --> 02:19:10,808
like federally legal cannabis businesses

2979
02:19:06,968 --> 02:19:13,568
on some of the dispensaries and people

2980
02:19:10,808 --> 02:19:15,488
that are more in the gray market are not

2981
02:19:13,568 --> 02:19:17,289
as confident you kind of want to be

2982
02:19:15,488 --> 02:19:19,539
careful how you approach banking if you

2983
02:19:17,290 --> 02:19:21,880
have like a product that is basically a

2984
02:19:19,540 --> 02:19:25,120
cannabis based product I I myself had

2985
02:19:21,879 --> 02:19:28,268
Royal Bank after 24 years just closed

2986
02:19:25,120 --> 02:19:31,540
all my accounts because they found out

2987
02:19:28,269 --> 02:19:33,700
after 19 years of those 24 years that I

2988
02:19:31,540 --> 02:19:35,769
was doing business with a product that

2989
02:19:33,700 --> 02:19:37,510
was that people were using with cannabis

2990
02:19:35,769 --> 02:19:39,040
so just that alone was enough for them

2991
02:19:37,510 --> 02:19:41,429
to close all my bank accounts I know

2992
02:19:39,040 --> 02:19:44,649
they did the same thing to Jodie Emery

2993
02:19:41,429 --> 02:19:46,359
and many many others so some people go

2994
02:19:44,648 --> 02:19:49,750
with credit unions some people go with

2995
02:19:46,359 --> 02:19:51,640
TD I guess Bank of Montreal now but it

2996
02:19:49,750 --> 02:19:53,139
still hasn't quite opened up to the

2997
02:19:51,639 --> 02:19:57,369
point where you could choose the bank

2998
02:19:53,139 --> 02:20:00,189
you want to choose to use and you have a

2999
02:19:57,370 --> 02:20:01,960
cannabis based business so it's federal

3000
02:20:00,189 --> 02:20:04,000
but there's still that little bit of

3001
02:20:01,959 --> 02:20:06,129
fear coming from the American side I'm

3002
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:08,228
sure if we looked into how much of the

3003
02:20:06,129 --> 02:20:11,259
money in Canada that's being invested in

3004
02:20:08,228 --> 02:20:13,539
our licensed production facilities I bet

3005
02:20:11,260 --> 02:20:16,149
you it would be well over 50% of America

3006
02:20:13,540 --> 02:20:18,130
money because I mean we all know America

3007
02:20:16,149 --> 02:20:19,799
is the marketplace although on a world

3008
02:20:18,129 --> 02:20:22,539
scale there's a big world out there

3009
02:20:19,799 --> 02:20:26,799
initially America seems to be like the

3010
02:20:22,540 --> 02:20:29,170
strong cannabis marketplace in my

3011
02:20:26,799 --> 02:20:32,229
opinion at least anyway and I'm sure

3012
02:20:29,170 --> 02:20:34,600
that Canada being you know positioned

3013
02:20:32,229 --> 02:20:36,520
the way they are right now having been

3014
02:20:34,600 --> 02:20:39,659
involved in this industry for the last

3015
02:20:36,521 --> 02:20:42,460
ten years or whatever they've they've

3016
02:20:39,659 --> 02:20:44,889
jumped the gun a little bit to companies

3017
02:20:42,459 --> 02:20:47,919
that might come behind them in a federal

3018
02:20:44,889 --> 02:20:49,719
federally legal way and I guess the most

3019
02:20:47,920 --> 02:20:52,329
important part of the licensing here in

3020
02:20:49,719 --> 02:20:55,239
Canada that I see the LPS appreciating

3021
02:20:52,329 --> 02:20:57,159
is that they have export licenses so you

3022
02:20:55,239 --> 02:21:00,579
know Canada is a small marketplace with

3023
02:20:57,159 --> 02:21:02,409
35 million the rest of the world is a

3024
02:21:00,579 --> 02:21:06,879
lot bigger with billions so being able

3025
02:21:02,409 --> 02:21:09,521
to ship to countries with reciprocity

3026
02:21:06,879 --> 02:21:11,889
you know laws that allow for cannabis to

3027
02:21:09,521 --> 02:21:14,030
exist as a medicine seems like a pretty

3028
02:21:11,889 --> 02:21:17,879
high value for those license holders

3029
02:21:14,030 --> 02:21:20,500
[Music]

3030
02:21:17,879 --> 02:21:22,149
interesting yeah they should have some I

3031
02:21:20,500 --> 02:21:26,889
think they have to get money transmitter

3032
02:21:22,149 --> 02:21:29,529
licenses and every stay right down here

3033
02:21:26,889 --> 02:21:31,180
so it's gonna be when they drop in PTMs

3034
02:21:29,530 --> 02:21:32,560
at various dispensaries I think it's

3035
02:21:31,180 --> 02:21:34,420
starting in Arizona I think going to

3036
02:21:32,559 --> 02:21:36,489
California in Vegas after that but

3037
02:21:34,420 --> 02:21:39,280
they'll be they'll be more than that in

3038
02:21:36,489 --> 02:21:42,100
a few months as it rolls out it is crazy

3039
02:21:39,280 --> 02:21:44,021
how far the pushback is gone you know

3040
02:21:42,100 --> 02:21:46,149
you see when I when I saw hemp getting

3041
02:21:44,021 --> 02:21:47,620
grown in Canada I thought oh well this

3042
02:21:46,149 --> 02:21:49,420
is good and then all of a sudden Medical

3043
02:21:47,620 --> 02:21:51,460
Licensing and everything seemed to be

3044
02:21:49,420 --> 02:21:53,771
moving along but they're just they're

3045
02:21:51,459 --> 02:21:56,439
holding the doors closed as for as long

3046
02:21:53,771 --> 02:21:58,570
as they can humanly possibly hold those

3047
02:21:56,440 --> 02:22:01,000
doors closed and the doors I'm speaking

3048
02:21:58,569 --> 02:22:03,670
of metaphorically are you know open up

3049
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:06,399
federal law with basically tax and

3050
02:22:03,670 --> 02:22:08,771
banking and you get those two things

3051
02:22:06,399 --> 02:22:11,260
because banking without banking in tax

3052
02:22:08,771 --> 02:22:14,230
what you end up getting is money

3053
02:22:11,260 --> 02:22:16,271
laundering and tax evasion and so those

3054
02:22:14,229 --> 02:22:19,689
those are big crimes that they can hit

3055
02:22:16,271 --> 02:22:21,460
you with that for me would be a little

3056
02:22:19,690 --> 02:22:26,280
bit scary doing business in a place that

3057
02:22:21,459 --> 02:22:27,459
wasn't it didn't have federal exemptions

3058
02:22:26,280 --> 02:22:29,710
make

3059
02:22:27,459 --> 02:22:31,478
some progress I mean our employees right

3060
02:22:29,709 --> 02:22:34,449
now are being paid by direct deposit

3061
02:22:31,478 --> 02:22:37,059
directly into the checking accounts they

3062
02:22:34,450 --> 02:22:39,340
get an electric our electron they get a

3063
02:22:37,059 --> 02:22:42,010
notification by email that they've been

3064
02:22:39,340 --> 02:22:44,530
paid they seek and see a PDF of their

3065
02:22:42,010 --> 02:22:46,750
their pay stub and how much in taxes

3066
02:22:44,530 --> 02:22:48,790
they're paying and you know other you

3067
02:22:46,750 --> 02:22:52,000
know benefits and stuff so it is

3068
02:22:48,790 --> 02:22:55,330
becoming more normalized I still think

3069
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:57,670
it needs to go a lot further because

3070
02:22:55,329 --> 02:23:00,299
again we don't enjoy all of the

3071
02:22:57,670 --> 02:23:03,370
financial tools that allow the other

3072
02:23:00,299 --> 02:23:05,920
industry let's have for no reason

3073
02:23:03,370 --> 02:23:08,530
whatsoever other than were what dealing

3074
02:23:05,920 --> 02:23:10,450
with a Schedule one substance we all

3075
02:23:08,530 --> 02:23:12,489
know the picks and shovels argument and

3076
02:23:10,450 --> 02:23:14,800
really I find it interesting with you

3077
02:23:12,489 --> 02:23:17,069
mark because you're really a picks and

3078
02:23:14,799 --> 02:23:20,259
shovels person you know you're not

3079
02:23:17,069 --> 02:23:23,199
growing or selling the plant for profit

3080
02:23:20,260 --> 02:23:26,889
you're selling a pick and a shovel it's

3081
02:23:23,200 --> 02:23:29,229
it's completely in the you know what

3082
02:23:26,889 --> 02:23:31,599
someone does with your product is what

3083
02:23:29,228 --> 02:23:34,209
someone does with your product it's like

3084
02:23:31,600 --> 02:23:37,690
a connection that has to be made again

3085
02:23:34,209 --> 02:23:39,819
in a decision somewhere in a bank office

3086
02:23:37,690 --> 02:23:43,090
probably in some high-rise that oh we

3087
02:23:39,819 --> 02:23:46,360
need to not allow this interaction when

3088
02:23:43,090 --> 02:23:51,159
what you're selling is totally legal and

3089
02:23:46,360 --> 02:23:54,970
breaks no law and has no direct impact

3090
02:23:51,159 --> 02:23:58,239
on something that's being sold that's

3091
02:23:54,969 --> 02:23:59,949
underneath some antiquated drug law and

3092
02:23:58,239 --> 02:24:02,350
to take it a step further

3093
02:23:59,950 --> 02:24:04,300
I'm also federally exempt by my

3094
02:24:02,350 --> 02:24:07,780
government to be able to grow and

3095
02:24:04,299 --> 02:24:10,209
process and extract resins

3096
02:24:07,780 --> 02:24:11,650
from cannabis plants so even if you were

3097
02:24:10,209 --> 02:24:14,259
to use the argument while we saw the

3098
02:24:11,649 --> 02:24:17,379
videos this guy's totally promoting

3099
02:24:14,260 --> 02:24:19,870
people to you know make hash with these

3100
02:24:17,379 --> 02:24:21,609
bags I have a license to do so it's

3101
02:24:19,870 --> 02:24:23,860
totally legal and why shouldn't I be

3102
02:24:21,610 --> 02:24:25,750
able to show other people who may or may

3103
02:24:23,860 --> 02:24:27,610
not have licenses I'm not the licensed

3104
02:24:25,750 --> 02:24:29,500
police I shouldn't have to check the

3105
02:24:27,610 --> 02:24:31,329
people who are watching my videos to see

3106
02:24:29,500 --> 02:24:32,889
if they have an element that allows them

3107
02:24:31,329 --> 02:24:35,829
to be exempt by their government for

3108
02:24:32,889 --> 02:24:38,019
Canada with to use cannabis so it just

3109
02:24:35,829 --> 02:24:40,488
sort of all made you know no sense to me

3110
02:24:38,020 --> 02:24:43,189
when the banks just decided to I

3111
02:24:40,488 --> 02:24:48,409
cut me off like that huge pain in the

3112
02:24:43,189 --> 02:24:49,850
ass I want to jump in here I I got to

3113
02:24:48,409 --> 02:24:52,369
get off here in a few minutes but I

3114
02:24:49,850 --> 02:24:56,449
wanted to throw out two things one of

3115
02:24:52,370 --> 02:24:59,689
them is normalizing something that Mark

3116
02:24:56,449 --> 02:25:01,310
said one of the things that's happening

3117
02:24:59,689 --> 02:25:04,000
at a local level here in California

3118
02:25:01,309 --> 02:25:07,430
because we're in a rural area is

3119
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:09,859
normalizing cannabis cannabis for years

3120
02:25:07,430 --> 02:25:11,988
people had to hide what they were doing

3121
02:25:09,859 --> 02:25:14,988
and now that it's becoming legal that's

3122
02:25:11,988 --> 02:25:21,619
part of the the evolution if you will

3123
02:25:14,988 --> 02:25:26,809
and part of normalizing is is like this

3124
02:25:21,620 --> 02:25:29,090
coming Monday I've been invited to tell

3125
02:25:26,809 --> 02:25:31,430
the local Rotary Club which is a

3126
02:25:29,090 --> 02:25:35,420
conservative business organization in

3127
02:25:31,430 --> 02:25:37,760
local towns our local Rotary Club wants

3128
02:25:35,420 --> 02:25:40,040
to hear how to grow a cannabis plant and

3129
02:25:37,760 --> 02:25:43,750
I'm going to do a 20 minute presentation

3130
02:25:40,040 --> 02:25:46,460
on how to care for a cannabis plant but

3131
02:25:43,750 --> 02:25:48,318
and the local sheriff is a member of

3132
02:25:46,459 --> 02:25:51,438
that Club actually it'll be fun to see

3133
02:25:48,318 --> 02:25:53,209
if he shows up so that's one of the ways

3134
02:25:51,439 --> 02:25:55,159
that people I want to encourage

3135
02:25:53,209 --> 02:25:57,528
everybody who's listening to normalize

3136
02:25:55,159 --> 02:25:59,420
your work normalize who you are help

3137
02:25:57,529 --> 02:26:01,189
people understand that cannabis is not

3138
02:25:59,420 --> 02:26:04,430
about criminal behavior it's it's about

3139
02:26:01,189 --> 02:26:06,529
all kinds of different people and I'm

3140
02:26:04,430 --> 02:26:08,630
one of them and all of you are one of

3141
02:26:06,529 --> 02:26:11,270
them the other thing I wanted to say is

3142
02:26:08,629 --> 02:26:13,789
vote that's how to change the banking

3143
02:26:11,270 --> 02:26:16,069
laws that's how to change the whole

3144
02:26:13,790 --> 02:26:18,050
prohibitionist mindset that's shaped law

3145
02:26:16,068 --> 02:26:20,389
around cannabis for so many years is

3146
02:26:18,049 --> 02:26:22,068
people need to get involved with the

3147
02:26:20,389 --> 02:26:26,028
system and vote I'm not going to tell

3148
02:26:22,068 --> 02:26:28,340
anybody how to vote but if enough people

3149
02:26:26,029 --> 02:26:29,899
show up we can change the situation

3150
02:26:28,340 --> 02:26:33,889
that's going on in the United States and

3151
02:26:29,898 --> 02:26:37,969
California at the moment in a positive

3152
02:26:33,889 --> 02:26:40,879
way is my belief and I want to thank all

3153
02:26:37,969 --> 02:26:43,129
of you for what you offer to my

3154
02:26:40,879 --> 02:26:45,108
understanding of how this plant works in

3155
02:26:43,129 --> 02:26:47,000
my life and in the people who are

3156
02:26:45,109 --> 02:26:52,970
listening and the people I know and you

3157
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:53,539
know this is sacred work anyone who's

3158
02:26:52,969 --> 02:26:55,608
listening

3159
02:26:53,539 --> 02:26:59,748
this is sacred work it's a sacred plant

3160
02:26:55,609 --> 02:27:02,600
and thank you for the invite Marcus and

02:27:08,180 --> 02:27:12,770

3165
02:27:09,309 --> 02:27:14,978
bye hey thanks for coming out Wade we do

3166

yeah thank you dude

3168
02:27:17,840 --> 02:27:21,770
[Music]

3169
02:27:18,969 --> 02:27:24,260
boom and also if you're gonna vote also

3170
02:27:21,770 --> 02:27:27,699
you should eat heroic doses of

3171
02:27:24,260 --> 02:27:30,289
psilocybin mushrooms not every day but

3172
02:27:27,699 --> 02:27:32,689
definitely every once in a while every

3173
02:27:30,289 --> 02:27:35,390
once in a while you should just crush

3174
02:27:32,689 --> 02:27:36,889
your own ego and go and learn some

3175
02:27:35,389 --> 02:27:39,769
important things I'm not gonna tell you

3176
02:27:36,889 --> 02:27:46,368
how to trip but I am gonna tell you you

3177
02:27:39,770 --> 02:27:48,140
should trip through that well speaking

3178
02:27:46,369 --> 02:27:49,489
of voting there's another form of voting

3179
02:27:48,139 --> 02:27:53,568
going on in the world right now that I

3180
02:27:49,488 --> 02:27:55,818
think's worth talking about because I'm

3181
02:27:53,568 --> 02:27:57,379
not States federally because I don't

3182
02:27:55,818 --> 02:27:59,898
feel like it's really representative of

3183
02:27:57,379 --> 02:28:01,879
the people anymore but local voting you

3184
02:27:59,898 --> 02:28:04,459
can make a lot of impact right and so

3185
02:28:01,879 --> 02:28:10,068
there was actually a local vote that was

3186
02:28:04,459 --> 02:28:12,049
mu la I used to camp for the seat so the

3187
02:28:10,068 --> 02:28:13,998
- cryptocurrency was forked off at

3188
02:28:12,049 --> 02:28:15,469
Bitcoin like in 2014 it's been growing

3189
02:28:13,998 --> 02:28:17,779
faster the Bitcoin but that one

3190
02:28:15,469 --> 02:28:19,608
difference it has is the capacity for

3191
02:28:17,779 --> 02:28:21,550
the people who have a lot of stake or a

3192
02:28:19,609 --> 02:28:25,789
lot of a lot of coins in this ecosystem

3193
02:28:21,549 --> 02:28:27,828
they have the power to vote spam so

3194
02:28:25,789 --> 02:28:29,689
instead of giving all of the mining

3195
02:28:27,828 --> 02:28:31,760
rewards some people who do mining like

3196
02:28:29,689 --> 02:28:33,648
they do in Bitcoin they actually take

3197
02:28:31,760 --> 02:28:35,869
10% of that money and put it into a

3198
02:28:33,648 --> 02:28:39,760
Treasury and let another group of people

3199
02:28:35,869 --> 02:28:39,760
who can prove that have a least excess

3200
02:28:39,908 --> 02:28:44,420
how to spend that so bunch of people

3201
02:28:42,619 --> 02:28:46,399
submit applications on hey and what if

3202
02:28:44,420 --> 02:28:47,898
we used the currency for this XYZ thing

3203
02:28:46,398 --> 02:28:49,939
though the group votes every month and

3204
02:28:47,898 --> 02:28:52,340
what to fund and they dole money out

3205
02:28:49,939 --> 02:28:57,828
every 30 days based on how the network

3206
02:28:52,340 --> 02:28:58,998
votes on well what to do so it's then

3207
02:28:57,828 --> 02:29:00,709
that networks when you do the math

3208
02:28:58,998 --> 02:29:02,238
there's actually more representation in

3209
02:29:00,709 --> 02:29:05,299
a cryptocurrency than there is in our US

3210
02:29:02,238 --> 02:29:06,920
government in terms of per capita people

3211
02:29:05,299 --> 02:29:10,849
- representative

3212
02:29:06,920 --> 02:29:14,719
and so III think it's an interesting new

3213
02:29:10,850 --> 02:29:16,340
mod on how we spend this cryptocurrency

3214
02:29:14,719 --> 02:29:17,478
fountain that's out there as opposed to

3215
02:29:16,340 --> 02:29:18,889
how we spend the Federal Reserve

3216
02:29:17,478 --> 02:29:20,869
fountain of money that's that's a

3217
02:29:18,889 --> 02:29:24,049
pumping out dollars but you know one

3218
02:29:20,870 --> 02:29:29,149
after another so anyway my mic rip

3219
02:29:24,049 --> 02:29:30,528
tomorrow Steve Jobs leave it well thanks

3220
02:29:29,148 --> 02:29:32,389
for sharing Kevin it's definitely

3221
02:29:30,529 --> 02:29:34,640
interesting I've looked into

3222
02:29:32,389 --> 02:29:36,500
cryptocurrency over the years my friend

3223
02:29:34,639 --> 02:29:38,689
just recently got rid of all his pot

3224
02:29:36,500 --> 02:29:40,370
coins that he had I can't remember what

3225
02:29:38,689 --> 02:29:41,659
they ended up turning into bitcoins or

3226
02:29:40,370 --> 02:29:43,340
something and he ended up getting a

3227
02:29:41,659 --> 02:29:45,529
substantial amount of money back from

3228
02:29:43,340 --> 02:29:47,148
those things from years ago when he

3229
02:29:45,529 --> 02:29:48,680
first turned me on to it was like oh you

3230
02:29:47,148 --> 02:29:51,769
gotta check out this pot coin I was like

3231
02:29:48,680 --> 02:29:53,960
really another another cryptocurrency

3232
02:29:51,770 --> 02:29:56,180
but it's you know what them when they

3233
02:29:53,959 --> 02:29:57,919
make it even more accessible I mean I've

3234
02:29:56,180 --> 02:29:59,450
got the cryptocurrency wallets with the

3235
02:29:57,920 --> 02:30:01,939
large statements that need to be made to

3236
02:29:59,450 --> 02:30:04,159
open the wallet and whatnot just it's

3237
02:30:01,939 --> 02:30:06,020
just not as it you know when I can just

3238
02:30:04,159 --> 02:30:09,049
tap on the machine when I'm at the

3239
02:30:06,020 --> 02:30:12,470
grocery store or whatever whenever they

3240
02:30:09,049 --> 02:30:14,000
need do you I yeah when that happens and

3241
02:30:12,469 --> 02:30:16,250
there's more just someone's gonna figure

3242
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:17,930
something out I just started watching a

3243
02:30:16,250 --> 02:30:19,459
show the other day that is hilarious

3244
02:30:17,930 --> 02:30:21,350
that I could see maybe them doing the

3245
02:30:19,459 --> 02:30:22,969
cryptocurrency version of it but the

3246
02:30:21,350 --> 02:30:25,609
Silicon Valley I had never seen that

3247
02:30:22,969 --> 02:30:32,929
show before oh yeah yeah they have they

3248
02:30:25,609 --> 02:30:35,359
have a bit of is it the same one go for

3249
02:30:32,930 --> 02:30:38,090
he's in there yeah it's like the shows

3250
02:30:35,359 --> 02:30:39,470
basically about it's like a comedy that

3251
02:30:38,090 --> 02:30:41,029
he's getting this guy accidentally

3252
02:30:39,469 --> 02:30:44,478
creates a lot an algorithm that

3253
02:30:41,029 --> 02:30:46,340
compresses anything at lossless like

3254
02:30:44,478 --> 02:30:48,739
there's no loss in the compression and

3255
02:30:46,340 --> 02:30:51,648
but he doesn't really know what he's got

3256
02:30:48,739 --> 02:30:53,659
and so the shows on HBO I think it

3257
02:30:51,648 --> 02:30:55,789
[ __ ] made me laughed so hard I was at

3258
02:30:53,659 --> 02:30:58,340
a friend's house I don't have cable TV

3259
02:30:55,790 --> 02:31:00,319
TV for that matter I'll download shows

3260
02:30:58,340 --> 02:31:02,210
every once in awhile but just seeing

3261
02:31:00,318 --> 02:31:04,459
this show was very funny and just how

3262
02:31:02,209 --> 02:31:05,659
these things happen and how people try

3263
02:31:04,459 --> 02:31:07,369
to take advantage of them and how

3264
02:31:05,659 --> 02:31:10,760
sometimes things are just accidentally

3265
02:31:07,370 --> 02:31:12,800
created for a platform that you know it

3266
02:31:10,760 --> 02:31:13,880
was never really intended for hopefully

3267
02:31:12,799 --> 02:31:16,369
someone does that the same way

3268
02:31:13,879 --> 02:31:18,858
BitTorrent opened up you know

3269
02:31:16,370 --> 02:31:19,650
downloading that was game changer from

3270
02:31:18,859 --> 02:31:21,210
from

3271
02:31:19,649 --> 02:31:23,640
loading the way we were accessing

3272
02:31:21,209 --> 02:31:26,609
information when BitTorrent came out it

3273
02:31:23,640 --> 02:31:28,970
changed everything and made made it so

3274
02:31:26,610 --> 02:31:32,790
much easier to download information that

3275
02:31:28,970 --> 02:31:34,591
was a big change well I think it's

3276
02:31:32,790 --> 02:31:36,030
professional we're seeing these tools

3277
02:31:34,591 --> 02:31:38,040
being used to fund things that our

3278
02:31:36,030 --> 02:31:38,971
governments won't and that's a step

3279
02:31:38,040 --> 02:31:41,700
direction

3280
02:31:38,970 --> 02:31:43,770
100% absolutely no it's really cool I

3281
02:31:41,700 --> 02:31:46,591
guess at that point it's just like a

3282
02:31:43,771 --> 02:31:48,061
super secret group that people don't

3283
02:31:46,591 --> 02:31:49,500
know anything about so you don't really

3284
02:31:48,060 --> 02:31:50,069
have any idea where that money's coming

3285
02:31:49,500 --> 02:31:51,690
from

3286
02:31:50,069 --> 02:31:53,489
or it's kind of like they're a little

3287
02:31:51,690 --> 02:31:56,341
bit more transparent and they kind of

3288
02:31:53,489 --> 02:31:58,050
let you know who they are well it's all

3289
02:31:56,341 --> 02:32:00,120
on a blockchain and so that blockchain

3290
02:31:58,050 --> 02:32:02,489
is basically just when it mints money

3291
02:32:00,120 --> 02:32:05,971
every month it happens to mint Treasury

3292
02:32:02,489 --> 02:32:07,440
and in case of - it's like 6100 - or

3293
02:32:05,970 --> 02:32:09,091
something every month that gets voted on

3294
02:32:07,440 --> 02:32:10,771
so that's getting it literally minted

3295
02:32:09,091 --> 02:32:12,300
right off the blockchain they're just

3296
02:32:10,771 --> 02:32:13,591
they're just voters that are involved

3297
02:32:12,300 --> 02:32:18,119
and decide in which direction and which

3298
02:32:13,591 --> 02:32:20,819
addresses it goes to but are paid in

3299
02:32:18,120 --> 02:32:23,460
taxable entity that's issuing those but

3300
02:32:20,819 --> 02:32:25,170
the masternode folks some are some are

3301
02:32:23,459 --> 02:32:26,459
around known and some are anonymous so

3302
02:32:25,170 --> 02:32:27,630
the people doing the voting you don't

3303
02:32:26,459 --> 02:32:28,770
always know who they are that can be

3304
02:32:27,630 --> 02:32:30,539
difficult if when you submit a proposal

3305
02:32:28,771 --> 02:32:35,460
to them if you don't know your audience

3306
02:32:30,540 --> 02:32:36,900
it's for an application ours was pretty

3307
02:32:35,459 --> 02:32:38,250
dense about sequencing and I don't think

3308
02:32:36,899 --> 02:32:39,899
a lot of people there fully understood

3309
02:32:38,250 --> 02:32:41,670
the it or cared to understand the

3310
02:32:39,899 --> 02:32:43,050
details all they really wanted to see

3311
02:32:41,670 --> 02:32:44,729
was that how can you demonstrate this

3312
02:32:43,050 --> 02:32:49,979
will improve the transaction rate of -

3313
02:32:44,729 --> 02:32:51,600
and do things - hang on this review

3314
02:32:49,979 --> 02:32:53,369
that's all done on crypto or it's just

3315
02:32:51,601 --> 02:32:55,771
the bounties for peer review are put out

3316
02:32:53,370 --> 02:32:57,990
for researchers we pay the researchers

3317
02:32:55,771 --> 02:32:59,460
to do the reviews and they bypass the

3318
02:32:57,989 --> 02:33:04,351
journals and just put the reviews

3319
02:32:59,459 --> 02:33:06,149
directly online and that keeps the grow

3320
02:33:04,351 --> 02:33:07,891
so that the genome breed without having

3321
02:33:06,149 --> 02:33:09,569
any journal have an ownership over it

3322
02:33:07,890 --> 02:33:11,190
but that's a different way to do peer

3323
02:33:09,569 --> 02:33:12,779
review and if you do the numbers and how

3324
02:33:11,190 --> 02:33:14,221
much peer review gets done it's like

3325
02:33:12,780 --> 02:33:16,230
it's a twenty billion dollar a year

3326
02:33:14,220 --> 02:33:18,829
market like there's a bunch of money

3327
02:33:16,229 --> 02:33:18,829
being pumped

3328
02:33:19,729 --> 02:33:25,310
and I mean half the papers can't be

3329
02:33:22,081 --> 02:33:30,451
reproduced I like how it's disruptive

3330
02:33:25,310 --> 02:33:31,740
yeah yeah got to cut some gotta cut some

3331
02:33:30,450 --> 02:33:35,490
people out of the out of the mix you

3332
02:33:31,740 --> 02:33:36,899
know and I think very the the Congress

3333
02:33:35,490 --> 02:33:38,370
are creating more harm than good you

3334
02:33:36,899 --> 02:33:40,290
know they're they're effectively they

3335
02:33:38,370 --> 02:33:42,090
don't pay the reviewers anything so

3336
02:33:40,290 --> 02:33:43,890
they're dependent on the viewers doing

3337
02:33:42,091 --> 02:33:46,921
stuff for them for free they charge

3338
02:33:43,890 --> 02:33:48,511
three grand usually and about if you if

3339
02:33:46,921 --> 02:33:53,101
it is behind a paywall

3340
02:33:48,511 --> 02:33:55,261
Oh fifty bucks oh there's a host of bad

3341
02:33:53,101 --> 02:33:57,211
actors that you know this is result of

3342
02:33:55,261 --> 02:33:58,951
Aaron Swartz committing suicide there's

3343
02:33:57,210 --> 02:34:01,200
just a host of copyright trolling that's

3344
02:33:58,950 --> 02:34:03,810
going on that's been very destructions I

3345
02:34:01,200 --> 02:34:06,660
think disruptive to the economy into and

3346
02:34:03,810 --> 02:34:08,911
just the progress and then kind that if

3347
02:34:06,661 --> 02:34:11,790
we can free scientific literature from

3348
02:34:08,911 --> 02:34:14,431
being embedded in that mash and I think

3349
02:34:11,790 --> 02:34:16,010
it's a it's a big step forward but it's

3350
02:34:14,431 --> 02:34:18,060
experiment it could fail we'll see

3351
02:34:16,011 --> 02:34:21,121
mm-hmm well that's cool that it's

3352
02:34:18,060 --> 02:34:22,591
happening nonetheless maybe it fails and

3353
02:34:21,120 --> 02:34:26,720
morphs into the next thing that will

3354
02:34:22,591 --> 02:34:28,229
succeed or maybe it just succeed good

3355
02:34:26,720 --> 02:34:31,171
very cool

3356
02:34:28,229 --> 02:34:33,360
