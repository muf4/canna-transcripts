31
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:35,989
you guys we wanted to do a quick little

32
00:02:34,009 --> 00:02:38,870
well show you a little trick we've

33
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:41,980
showed it already a few times and it's

34
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:45,769
uh it's a quick and easy way to access

35
00:02:41,979 --> 00:02:48,828
near pure Glen Head dry cept and in

36
00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:50,239
smaller amounts john was gonna do it

37
00:02:48,829 --> 00:02:53,030
here last time he was here but the herb

38
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,530
was a little bit moist totally taken

39
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:58,669
home and dry it more he's dried it out

40
00:02:54,530 --> 00:03:00,919
real good so now it seems like we'll be

41
00:02:58,669 --> 00:03:02,750
able to we'll be able to see the results

42

00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:12,179
be a popular shot already I can tell

63
00:04:10,469 --> 00:04:13,620
well you flipped it upside down and

64
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:16,470

nice to share dad UK friends today is

87
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:55,668
actually a sad day on the memory banks

88
00:05:50,658 --> 00:05:59,029
for me so the anniversary of my father

89
00:05:55,668 --> 00:06:15,318
and his wife and their accident nine

90
00:05:59,029 --> 00:06:20,418
years today nine years where you say too

91
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:22,930
bad a speeches I'm speechless was a

92
00:06:20,418 --> 00:06:22,930
great hit

93
00:06:40,069 --> 00:06:46,529
yeah so there it is

94
00:06:43,769 --> 00:06:49,609
that was the Oh God purple metallic haze

95
00:06:46,529 --> 00:06:52,439
it takes the God bud can you taste that

96
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:54,090
that very pronounced I don't know I

97
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:56,790
always compared it to that weird purple

98
00:06:54,089 --> 00:07:00,659
gum that tasted like soap that they put

99
00:06:56,790 --> 00:07:03,390
in your mailbox and like the ladies it

100
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:07,170
was like a marketing campaign any you

101
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:09,389
guys remember that smooth gum tasted

102
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:11,520
like soap free gum showed up in the in

103
00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:12,659
the mail weird Canadian thing it'll be

104
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:15,689
interesting to see if anyone remembers

105
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:17,160
that I suspect that we will have people

106
00:07:15,689 --> 00:07:23,069
that do remember it and not only that

107
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:25,770
they'll even name it that's great why

108
00:07:23,069 --> 00:07:29,189
don't we go recover and we'll set it up

109
00:07:25,769 --> 00:07:30,419
here so we can we can dry sip some of

110
00:07:29,189 --> 00:07:38,209
this butter real quick and then we'll

111
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:38,210
whip off a quick batch in the Buffs yeah

112
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:45,990
okay all right so it's time to do a

113
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:49,290
little quick dry sifting we've got the

114
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:51,629
two I guess these would be what three

115
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:54,840
feet by two feet or is a one foot by two

116
00:07:51,629 --> 00:07:56,759
foot two feet by one foot I'd say these

117
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:57,750
are you can pick them up at fresh head

118
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:00,000
acecomm

119
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:03,180
and the dry six section and this is a

120
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:07,410
ninety ninety lines per inch or mesh

121
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:11,449
count and a sixty lines per inch or mesh

122
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:14,200
count so those numbers of cords 60 is a

123
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:17,329
250 and 90 is

124
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:18,319
180 so they're counterintuitive numbers

125
00:08:17,329 --> 00:08:21,139
from micron

126
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:24,439
however these little screens offer a

127
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:27,918
nice ability to acquire a full melt dry

128
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:29,600
sift pure 99% gland heads and a really

129
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:51,319
quick amount of time so we've got Johnny

130
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:54,589
B's astroboy here awesome awesome so

131
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:56,360
that's a real small small amount we

132
00:08:54,589 --> 00:08:59,150
dropped you know less than an ounce onto

133
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:01,250
the onto the screen and we did it in a

134
00:08:59,149 --> 00:09:03,470
way where we really cost very little

135
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:06,500
friction whatsoever so let's just check

136
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:08,240
it out to see what fell through well

137
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:11,509
that's very very small about it looks

138
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,129
almost all like just pure heads so let's

139
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:15,528
put a little bit more on there so we

140
00:09:13,129 --> 00:09:18,620
know we've got well I guess I could try

141
00:09:15,528 --> 00:09:22,189
to card up the bottom first let's see

142
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:24,879
what we got I'll use the method 7

143
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:31,520
sticker the good people at method 7

144
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:36,009
sounds over oh yeah super super small oh

145
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:36,009
it's there ready

146
00:09:40,929 --> 00:09:52,000
all right nice I haven't crushed it

147
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:58,100
either I get some of this crush on there

148
00:09:52,000 --> 00:10:00,289
some of the crush how long did you drive

149
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:02,090
this for um what about specs we've been

150
00:10:00,289 --> 00:10:04,519
sitting in a bowl since the last time I

151
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:05,720
was here thanks Allah yeah which was

152
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:09,549
what a week or two ago

153
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:12,110
uh yeah a week ago last puff Wednesday

154
00:10:09,549 --> 00:10:13,939
it was actually hanging for about two

155
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:15,470
and a half weeks it's been two weeks ago

156
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:17,300
because I think my son was born on the

157
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:19,910
last pump one doesn't mean so me two

158
00:10:17,299 --> 00:10:21,919
weeks so last plus Wednesday before you

159
00:10:19,909 --> 00:10:23,839
saw this one it's soy okay

160
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:25,549
I was thinking out loud in my brain

161
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:49,399
without saying anything

162
00:10:25,549 --> 00:10:52,279
yep today I'm camera back and I just to

163
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:53,959
see what we got this time around quite a

164
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:56,990
bit more has fallen it really looks

165
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:58,990
almost all glandular though it does very

166
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:01,039
small amount of contaminant there

167
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:03,470
although I guess on the Camry you can

168
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:06,549
see it is much more contaminant let's

169
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:06,550
see what we got off the bottom

170
00:11:17,169 --> 00:11:20,828
well there's more visible there this

171
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:30,579
time around

172
00:11:20,828 --> 00:11:30,578
definitely color on that quite lovely

173
00:11:35,289 --> 00:11:40,009
there you go yeah you know just then you

174
00:11:38,568 --> 00:11:43,789
could do that over and over and over

175
00:11:40,009 --> 00:11:48,829
again by moving the material gently you

176
00:11:43,789 --> 00:11:52,399
can also get the second batch that's

177
00:11:48,828 --> 00:12:01,429
just sitting on top I just give that the

178
00:11:52,399 --> 00:12:15,948
flick the trick test leak check and once

179
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:18,198
again you can now fold with you see how

180
00:12:15,948 --> 00:12:19,939
flexible this yet since we don't big go

181
00:12:18,198 --> 00:12:22,789
for that look at the different colors

182
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:29,779
even though hey see how the one's a

183
00:12:22,789 --> 00:12:34,929
little lighter finish it let me stand

184
00:12:29,778 --> 00:12:34,929
microphones on this as it goes

185
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:42,139
you want to make some bubs well I think

186
00:12:39,419 --> 00:12:45,389
it's that time let's do it

187
00:12:42,139 --> 00:12:48,180
alright Johnny B so I'm gonna dab up

188
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:48,810
some of that the first dry stuff that we

189
00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:50,969
just made

190
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:52,649
and I definitely did alright well the

191
00:12:50,970 --> 00:13:02,939
smaller pile is the a why don't you take

192
00:12:52,649 --> 00:13:04,860
that one we're gonna go for the end it's

193
00:13:02,938 --> 00:13:08,778
going to be become a little difficult

194
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:08,778
for you got this

195
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:28,350
okay okay there we go

196
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:31,740
one hit here I see too well in there but

197
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:31,740
melt it out

198
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:45,780
nice taste

199
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:52,180
very tasty you can definitely um I'm

200
00:13:49,960 --> 00:14:02,790
getting used to the taste of the

201
00:13:52,179 --> 00:14:02,789
asteroid I love the variance and well

202
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:07,959

stepmom and it was just kind of I just

211
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:28,750
wasn't feeling it but I think I'm

212
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:35,410
feeling it now everything's right here

213
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:37,149
and ready so details live yeah we've hit

214
00:14:35,409 --> 00:14:40,600
a couple of reps already as you can tell

215
00:14:37,149 --> 00:14:42,850
by John's slur the slur hid in the foam

216
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:45,340
AHA well you know what it was it was

217
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:49,269

223
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:05,259
he was only here for half an hour but I

224
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:07,540
am gonna film with flap in the near

225
00:15:05,259 --> 00:15:11,769
future so you will see an upcoming video

226
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:19,389
of flap and his garden and yeah there's

227
00:15:11,769 --> 00:15:24,629

242
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:20,840
be a decent little fresh frozen run it's

243
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:22,189
not huge some I thought we might test in

244

up the mothers alright so what the

262
00:17:58,849 --> 00:18:08,949
layers of ice layers of our layers of

263
00:18:01,339 --> 00:18:12,569
ice deserve a bit of squishing on this

264
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:15,130
because we're definitely going more in

265
00:18:12,569 --> 00:18:17,700
I'm not broken up too big either most

266
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:24,730
everything's down to a reasonable size

267
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:26,470
piece might still be yeah it was a while

268
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:28,150
ago that I cut these down but you know

269
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:34,210
it's nice you just pop them in the

270
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:36,490
freezer and wow they break up nice the

271
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:38,319
resin you guys like really you can

272
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:39,190
exceed blistering here right now it's

273
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:40,419
all over my hands

274
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:42,490
yeah that's the best so that's one thing

275
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:44,830
I like that Astro Boy the Barbra this is

276
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:46,660
the bomb that's all I know they all melt

277
00:18:44,829 --> 00:18:48,639
just so beautifully and this is just

278
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:51,720
another one of those stuff you can see

279
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,920
the raw heads on my fingers I smell a

280
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:56,410
little bit better count I'm gonna have

281
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:58,420
one of those coming up one day and we'll

282
00:18:56,410 --> 00:19:01,029
be smell can be able to push a button

283
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:05,410
you know the smell when we smell oh yeah

284
00:19:01,029 --> 00:19:08,829
this one's crispy that's the bag crisp

285
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:18,580
crisp and snappy it's like it's freshly

286
00:19:08,829 --> 00:19:21,059
frozen ice dry man this is makes me

287
00:19:18,579 --> 00:19:21,059
happy

288
00:19:24,009 --> 00:19:27,098
[Music]

289
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:41,639
and you guys think Johnny B is well

290
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:41,639
deserving of a rip

291
00:19:45,349 --> 00:19:48,389
[Music]

292
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:55,460
I'm going for all of it you're scuffin

293
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:58,670
that bad oh yeah

294
00:19:55,460 --> 00:20:00,470
so probably each bag weighs roughly I'm

295
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:04,130
gonna say about you each bags about a

296
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:06,110
half a pound wet

297
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:07,640
so that's won't be a pound of wet so

298
00:20:06,109 --> 00:20:22,659
probably looking at about a quarter

299
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:40,520
pound of dry you can definitely see that

300
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:43,700
that is some killer killer fun I've done

301
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:46,279
a couple of times you always got to make

302
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:49,400
sure that you tie this bag yeah tie the

303
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:50,779
zipper it's kind of important pretty

304
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:53,450
darn important if you don't want the

305
00:20:50,779 --> 00:20:55,639
thing leaking out into your I mean I

306
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:58,250
still use a 220 bag as you can see in

307
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:59,960
the bucket behind me however I was

308
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:02,750
talking me about that because I haven't

309
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:05,750
been I mean picking the bag would do the

310
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:08,779
job for me but I've been instructed nope

311
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:12,369
well I mean I'm not instructing no I you

312
00:21:08,779 --> 00:21:12,369

[Music]

315
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:19,630
so this is what you should be doing

316
00:22:17,089 --> 00:22:22,099
without your fresh buns

317
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:23,660
it's what John and I like to do anyway

318
00:22:22,099 --> 00:22:25,339
you know a lot of people kind of can't

319
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:27,080
wrap their heads around it but we always

320
00:22:25,339 --> 00:22:29,779
go back to the sort of education that

321
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:32,210
we're seeking it's like if you ordered

322
00:22:29,779 --> 00:22:34,940
pizza you want to eat the pizza well if

323
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:36,620
you're growing herb you want to use the

324
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:47,808

329
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:06,680
nine minutes my last time I did go check

330
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:06,680

331
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:36,410
yeah that's right real nice color on it

332
00:23:17,069 --> 00:23:36,409
too yeah this is gonna be delicious

333
00:23:39,349 --> 00:23:43,559
that is some terpene rich bubble hash

334
00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:46,019
water and we're definitely gonna be

335
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:47,609
taking a sip of it once she's done

336
00:23:46,019 --> 00:24:04,799
mixing up and we're ready to pull the

337
00:23:47,609 --> 00:24:09,299
bags I like I like your actions Jonathan

338
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:12,059
I like it all right well this thing is

339
00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:13,919
just stopped mixin yeah I've got excited

340
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:16,079
it was good I was like why does myself

341
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:19,410
put some nice colors beautiful color

342
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:23,099
beautiful that is a good smell I have to

343
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:25,470
say that's [ __ ] if it's me so I guess

344
00:24:23,099 --> 00:24:27,299
rather than wait any amount of time

345
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:29,400
because we know there's no reason to

346
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:38,220
leave that [ __ ] soaking in water for

347
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:42,900
longer than you need to send being

348
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:45,240
collected immediately look at that no

349
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:48,230
maybe I could not turn in then show what

350
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:48,230
we're used to seeing you know

351
00:24:53,079 --> 00:25:00,980
you gotta love Johnny beat alright so

352
00:24:56,179 --> 00:25:02,750
here we are with the Congolese and some

353
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:05,329
Sorrell plants from Jamaica with the

354
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:10,880
Ortega in the background it's not I'd

355
00:25:05,329 --> 00:25:13,460
introduce everyone it's not growing in

356
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:19,250
my garden yet it's not the Congolese is

357
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:21,140
being amazing we're definitely gonna do

358
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:32,298
another run on this almost immediately

359
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:37,850
perfect I think it's a good idea I think

360
00:25:32,298 --> 00:25:39,230
so a loud annoying

361
00:25:37,849 --> 00:25:40,879
although I guess let me just leave this

362
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:42,589
right now rather than look is it right

363
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,390
now it's not in water first

364
00:25:42,589 --> 00:25:45,889
we'll pull facts and then we'll get this

365
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:47,120
guy riding that way they can kind of

366
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:49,880
stick with us while we're pulling the

367
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:53,899
bags otherwise at that time if the job

368
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:57,919
didn't do some work now all you gotta do

369
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:59,630
is pack bowls actually is different

370
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:08,030
Ward's you get from what's coming out of

371
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:09,980
this this is right here why I have an

372
00:26:08,029 --> 00:26:12,039
MMA are license this is the entire

373
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:16,120
purpose I grow cannabis

374
00:26:12,039 --> 00:26:22,899
I wouldn't say mainly I would say only

375
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:22,899
to procure the glandular trichomes heads

376
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:33,170
just a little bit of contaminants on

377
00:26:31,549 --> 00:26:34,730
this one I guess we could still collect

378
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:41,230
notes always worth something shilling

379
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:45,279
yeah looks like stigma hair is mostly I

380
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:45,279
don't think they brought my spray bottle

381
00:26:45,789 --> 00:26:53,329
usually have a little spray bottle see

382
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:55,790
what happens today we're gonna be

383
00:26:53,329 --> 00:26:57,829
freezing what we get it's gonna be

384
00:26:55,789 --> 00:27:00,819
frozen until probably tomorrow and then

385
00:26:57,829 --> 00:27:00,819
it'll be microplaned

386
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:22,360
160 is pretty much Mt tiny little bets

387
00:27:09,579 --> 00:27:22,359
160 almost an insignificant amount

388
00:27:25,369 --> 00:27:36,359
your brother sir news problemo

389
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:37,950
yes usually these fresh frozen runs that

390
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:41,569
are very you know that they could be as

391
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:53,450
low as 50 to 60 grams of dry material

392
00:27:41,569 --> 00:27:55,460
show a ton of contaminant in - oh yeah

393

394
00:27:55,460 --> 00:28:04,890
I'm the one that should be using this

395
00:27:57,869 --> 00:28:10,319
bucket there we go Mario's very very

396
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:14,490
tiny amount much like a dab which is

397
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:18,079
okay on this bag but I wouldn't want to

398
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:21,279
see it on the next three

399
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:25,849
this one just needs to be rinsed first

400
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:29,059
house it so rinsed all right so now the

401
00:28:25,849 --> 00:28:34,029
120 my color as you can see with the

402
00:28:29,059 --> 00:28:36,019
shirt that I'm wearing drain them slow

403
00:28:34,029 --> 00:28:37,490
so I guess they'll be a little bit of

404
00:28:36,019 --> 00:28:39,910
bubble in this watch and definitely see

405
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:39,910

what's up well the hash looks damn near

408
00:28:53,329 --> 00:28:57,129
orange when you're flipping it around

409
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:20,509
that's pretty cool that's actually

410
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:22,849
pretty pretty cool I've never taken a

411
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:31,609
good look at it but as you pull that you

412
00:29:22,849 --> 00:29:32,959
can just see all this that's cool it is

413
00:29:31,609 --> 00:29:34,939
it's really cool

414
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,519
take a good look at your next time water

415
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:39,440
running take a look at the 90 water

416
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:40,940
before you pull the bag now it looks

417
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:48,019
almost like you're looking in a lake

418
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:54,529
yeah it's a really really cool guy yes

creamy goodness and if you definitely

436
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:13,370
see a difference in the water and Bank

437
00:31:08,569 --> 00:31:14,000
you see it's less like yeah we pulled

438
00:31:13,369 --> 00:31:15,829
out quite a bit

439
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:20,950
anyway yeah we actually that's

440
00:31:15,829 --> 00:31:24,678
impressive this is a real nice like

441
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:26,900
unbelievable gooey pile of like right

442
00:31:24,679 --> 00:31:28,940
now I'm jumping for joy inside I can see

443
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:32,390
that I'm actually jumping for joy for

444
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:34,490
and as you can see this Johnny and I'm

445
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:37,370
just the EO is twice the size of the

446
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:39,140
money that we just pulled so you know

447
00:31:37,369 --> 00:31:41,089
that that 73 is gonna do with you guys

448
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:43,130
it's close to three times yes

449
00:31:41,089 --> 00:31:45,168
yeah I would say three times just go

450
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:47,750
thickness of it right yeah definitely

451
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:51,620
it's uh it's a beautiful beautiful sandy

452
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:53,839
color I do know that that's gonna be

453
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:59,709
some picture take me there oh yeah

454
00:31:53,839 --> 00:32:14,269
that's so nice to be making a batch

455
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:18,308
beautiful awesome that one in the 73 bag

456
00:32:14,269 --> 00:32:18,308
is the heaviest of the three so far

457
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:35,310
notice that we're running right now our

458
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:44,569
a really heavy oh my god does it smell

459
00:32:35,309 --> 00:32:44,569
that this is so incredible so tasty

460
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:59,609
mmm-hmm look at the way that came up -

461
00:32:56,460 --> 00:33:06,630
I'm not gonna conceal it looks purple

462
00:32:59,609 --> 00:33:09,599
almost I'm seeing I'm looking at just

463
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:17,040
the way it's though the Y it looks

464
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:22,469
pretty cool and it looks to be like

465
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:23,609
potentially more than then the 45 you

466
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:39,269
know was actually gonna be probably

467
00:33:23,609 --> 00:33:40,709
really good - that's a efficient 1973

468
00:33:39,269 --> 00:33:45,629
about the same maybe a little bit more

469
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:47,069
than the 70s right but you're gonna be

470
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:48,990
able to see all this fuss little big

471
00:33:47,069 --> 00:33:50,759
just great as you can see I'm always

472
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:52,500
speechless when I'm looking at just epic

473
00:33:50,759 --> 00:33:56,000
resin so there's not those little

474
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:56,000
minutes and I'm just like a brother

475
00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:02,070
pushing back and taking out the same

476
00:33:59,099 --> 00:34:03,449
time all right there we go yes I was

477
00:34:02,069 --> 00:34:05,399
passing it over I could see the niceness

478
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:08,059
on the screen I was like I'm making a

479
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:08,059
mistake here

480
00:34:11,469 --> 00:34:14,648
[Music]

481
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:36,110
all right 45 micron bag drained in about

482
00:34:18,949 --> 00:35:00,289
five seconds that's fun to balance I do

483
00:34:36,110 --> 00:35:10,130
I always balance but that's that's a big

484
00:35:00,289 --> 00:35:12,320
pump bag and you cease water yeah under

485
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:24,590
the water be to the screams in the resin

486
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:26,950
stays I said I said 45 nice pulls nice

487
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:26,950
pulls

488
00:35:32,659 --> 00:35:50,369
getting that at all and then he sort of

489
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:54,050
clarity pretty nice and I think the last

490
00:35:50,369 --> 00:35:54,049
thing I pulled up this was Astro Boy

491
00:35:54,889 --> 00:36:03,719
that's for sure yeah it's real nice

492
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:12,000
about six weeks I guess

493
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:14,659
six weeks of water yep 42 days yeah

494
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:22,409
doesn't show any difference with

495
00:36:14,659 --> 00:36:26,149
presence of mouth better yeah I think

496
00:36:22,409 --> 00:36:26,149
this residents all gonna really nicely

497
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:46,900
oh yeah I think I in there you're in the

498
00:36:43,969 --> 00:36:57,199
cam halfway in halfway out

499
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:58,838
forget the wide angle on Johnny yeah for

500
00:36:57,199 --> 00:37:07,159
sure

501
00:36:58,838 --> 00:37:09,619
take it easy all around the road with

502
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:11,269
cannabis legalization nonsense I know

503
00:37:09,619 --> 00:37:11,980
it's pretty awesome it is it's really

504
00:37:11,269 --> 00:37:15,048
awesome

505
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:17,900
we're waiting on all these cool things

506
00:37:15,048 --> 00:37:20,588
to occur in the next you know upcoming

507
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:23,289
year it's gonna be just exciting to see

508
00:37:20,588 --> 00:37:25,460
what will be exciting is when we start

509
00:37:23,289 --> 00:37:28,069
going from country to country and

510
00:37:25,460 --> 00:38:05,480
puffing on resin like this absolutely

511
00:37:28,068 --> 00:38:07,909
sharing our knowledge rich so these two

512
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:11,420
that we have right here will be put in

513
00:38:07,909 --> 00:38:14,108
the freezer immediately which I'm going

514
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:14,108
to do right now

515
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:28,029
I'm gonna do guys not gonna get very

516
00:38:24,699 --> 00:38:38,109
cute this tank it right into put these

517
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:42,570
bags right back in the bucket one thing

518
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:42,570
I do find is when I'm doing my second

519
00:38:52,170 --> 00:39:24,190
right off the back end with the 45 so we

520
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:28,300
didn't release it from the last one but

521
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:30,159
as you can see it's quite easy it's

522
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:32,580
really it's a non-stressful long

523
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:32,579
strenuous

524
00:39:34,369 --> 00:39:41,778
about a ton of markets back here how

525
00:39:37,969 --> 00:39:49,699
these things ready I'll be able to turn

526
00:39:41,778 --> 00:39:51,259
on that machine now one thing I just did

527
00:39:49,699 --> 00:39:54,588
is I turned the leg inside out but I

528
00:39:51,259 --> 00:39:56,449
always want to have the label when I'm

529
00:39:54,588 --> 00:39:58,728
folding to the outside and not to the

530
00:39:56,449 --> 00:40:03,380
inside where the bags are structured

531
00:39:58,728 --> 00:40:05,239
here so when you put in the bag and

532
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:09,309
always make sure that when you fold it

533
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:09,309
over you see the see this a bubble

534
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:15,489
bubble bags I should say

535
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:42,079
that would not be good

536
00:41:35,719 --> 00:41:44,839
go with the My Little Pony some stuff

537
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:48,150
that round actually last Wednesday

538
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:51,480
around this mark was waiting for a son

539
00:41:48,150 --> 00:42:00,809
to be born I figure I was going to bring

540
00:41:51,480 --> 00:42:06,780
some bubble hush Oh Jonny bees hitting

541
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:08,969
home just in time for more bags do that

542
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:11,810
a second well I was working away and

543
00:42:08,969 --> 00:42:11,809
then my back

544
00:42:24,969 --> 00:42:28,199
how's a good chunk

545
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:44,710
I think I did this one for 14 weeks what

546
00:42:41,889 --> 00:42:59,889
did i do I think it was 10 weeks did you

547
00:42:44,710 --> 00:43:01,300
do oh yeah that jerk waters nice I got

548
00:42:59,889 --> 00:43:03,099
the B right here he's been hanging over

549
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:04,720
the wasp he's okay

550
00:43:03,099 --> 00:43:06,639
he's cool I'm not gonna bite Johnny

551
00:43:04,719 --> 00:43:09,099

not getting bit he's landing on my head

554
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:17,649
he's definitely some of the turkeys in

555
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:20,619
that water that's what he's after right

556
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:31,210
now well I want to put those other two

557
00:43:20,619 --> 00:43:34,019
bags in a bucket then we'll get another

558
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:34,019
bags go in here

559
00:43:41,009 --> 00:43:56,769
makes it other batches in the freezer

560
00:43:46,298 --> 00:44:04,798
freezing away I think there's plenty ice

561
00:43:56,768 --> 00:44:08,199
inside here put the rest in there to

562
00:44:04,798 --> 00:44:21,969
where it does the most work well sure

563
00:44:08,199 --> 00:44:36,338
you have in contact with herb so was

564
00:44:21,969 --> 00:44:38,858
that all three minutes yeah yeah oh no I

565
00:44:36,338 --> 00:44:41,650
left one bag downstairs actually I only

566
00:44:38,858 --> 00:44:44,940
brought up to now it should be fine yeah

567
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:44,940
especially with this cold water

568
00:44:54,369 --> 00:44:57,409
[Music]

569
00:45:05,719 --> 00:45:16,409
well shall we rock it up for another six

570
00:45:10,949 --> 00:45:20,068
to nine minutes to get clicked you want

571
00:45:16,409 --> 00:45:28,409
clickety-click I do quickly needed a

572
00:45:20,068 --> 00:45:31,498
little I'm gonna I'm gonna guess it's

573
00:45:28,409 --> 00:45:37,699
some type of an OG so no Dave really

574
00:45:31,498 --> 00:45:37,699
likes is over just just and

575
00:45:40,119 --> 00:45:42,960
maybe not

576
00:46:16,630 --> 00:46:19,869
[Music]

577
00:46:39,269 --> 00:46:55,780
so for me I did overpacked

578
00:46:53,889 --> 00:46:57,819
oh no you definitely didn't that's what

579
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:59,800
I'm thinking Tuesday mine was over

580
00:46:57,820 --> 00:47:02,470
packed a nice - good job by the first

581
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:04,090
run so you wouldn't learn that for the

582
00:47:02,469 --> 00:47:06,329
first time for me but just by getting

583
00:47:04,090 --> 00:47:11,100
excited the only real bummer about that

584
00:47:06,329 --> 00:47:14,079
is the exposure to the water

585
00:47:11,099 --> 00:47:17,889
well sure cuz you're robbing terpenes

586
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:25,799
from the water as you wash so those

587
00:47:17,889 --> 00:47:25,799
turkeys I guess yes on

588
00:47:51,519 --> 00:48:04,940
don't take it oh yeah look force to be

589
00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:09,250
reckoned with I love that I have just

590
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:09,250
enough spots but all my bags I know

591
00:48:09,489 --> 00:48:22,669
unless I would say quite nice looking

592
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:24,380
you know bubble you got when you thought

593
00:48:22,670 --> 00:48:26,510
you were gonna get the best but you kind

594
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:40,369
of got that you expect this as your

595
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:45,069
second batch check that 98 that does

596
00:48:40,369 --> 00:48:45,068
look cost you to let that go

597
00:48:46,480 --> 00:49:04,039
anyone lose the RISM of the day let

598
00:48:51,980 --> 00:49:05,900
alone I do dad you would actually pull

599
00:49:04,039 --> 00:49:14,539
the bag and it would be drying and ready

600
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:16,220
to smoke that's a new product bin deer

601
00:49:14,539 --> 00:49:22,460
could be within the next 25 years but

602
00:49:16,219 --> 00:49:24,709
I'll never forget them yes it is and

603
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:27,130
this is the second run and it's looks

604
00:49:24,710 --> 00:49:27,130
great

605
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:41,900
okay new screen dude screams let's just

606
00:49:37,039 --> 00:49:52,930
tear let's just move this over so that's

607
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:52,930
just kind of funny that

608
00:49:57,769 --> 00:50:14,940
that concentration of scooping up a fine

609
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:18,389
big Yankee yeah if I don't smoke in your

610
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:22,079
hands up in my coconut oil the last time

611
00:50:18,389 --> 00:50:23,789
I use 90 put the barbed rice if of 90

612
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:29,130
there's 99 percent heads

613
00:50:23,789 --> 00:50:31,650
garance I definitely do not smoke no I

614
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:39,420
have a lot of it do you make it into you

615
00:50:31,650 --> 00:50:40,680
some products so there's different ways

616
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:44,579
of getting and I just throw it in the

617
00:50:40,679 --> 00:50:51,929
food at this point it's not

618
00:50:44,579 --> 00:50:54,179
decarboxylated it is so we got to eat it

619
00:50:51,929 --> 00:50:57,088
so I find with the stuff that doesn't

620
00:50:54,179 --> 00:51:01,348
burn that bomb on the pipe does great

621
00:50:57,088 --> 00:51:08,699
well in my food oh yeah edibles and

622
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:10,260
evening those cannabinoids help you yeah

623
00:51:08,699 --> 00:51:11,969
you know so there's something to go over

624
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:14,190
real quickly like if you were say

625
00:51:11,969 --> 00:51:16,049
diagnosed and you found out you were

626
00:51:14,190 --> 00:51:17,550
fairly ill and you were looking to

627
00:51:16,050 --> 00:51:18,900
answer the question you know what do I

628
00:51:17,550 --> 00:51:20,280
do

629
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:23,160
I'm getting this question quite a bit

630
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:25,230
lately and what I'm telling people is

631
00:51:23,159 --> 00:51:28,019
that the best thing really that I'm

632
00:51:25,230 --> 00:51:31,079
finding is to a join the group on

633
00:51:28,019 --> 00:51:32,759
Facebook the endocannabinoids system and

634
00:51:31,079 --> 00:51:33,348
that's a group of people on there that

635
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:36,049
are

636
00:51:33,349 --> 00:51:37,849
and like-minded information sharing

637
00:51:36,048 --> 00:51:41,358
information in regards to th-these

638
00:51:37,849 --> 00:51:43,430
cancer shrinking properties and to CBD

639
00:51:41,358 --> 00:51:46,068
and different cannabinoid profiles and

640
00:51:43,429 --> 00:51:48,078
their anti-seizure properties and so on

641
00:51:46,068 --> 00:51:50,900
and so forth that's one good spot to

642
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:52,818
start but in the regards to what you do

643
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:55,160
to actually help yourself using

644
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:57,949
cannabinoids my answer is that you

645
00:51:55,159 --> 00:51:59,899
saturate your endocannabinoid system if

646
00:51:57,949 --> 00:52:01,670
you live in a dispensary friend a city

647
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:04,608
that would mean acquiring salves and

648
00:52:01,670 --> 00:52:08,798
patches sublingual drops I would still

649
00:52:04,608 --> 00:52:11,268
vaporize I would consume a cannabinoid

650
00:52:08,798 --> 00:52:14,929
infusion of either the rick simpson soil

651
00:52:11,268 --> 00:52:19,608
or a bubble hash infused coconut oil or

652
00:52:14,929 --> 00:52:21,588
you know any variety so much variety but

653
00:52:19,608 --> 00:52:23,119
the main the main point is that you know

654
00:52:21,588 --> 00:52:24,588
if you're really you've been diagnosed

655
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:26,809
with something serious and you're and

656
00:52:24,588 --> 00:52:29,768
you're quite ill you would want to eat a

657
00:52:26,809 --> 00:52:33,890
good solid gram of those pure

658
00:52:29,768 --> 00:52:41,139
cannabinoids you want to eat basically a

659
00:52:33,889 --> 00:52:44,108
grandma bubs okay yeah it has to be

660
00:52:41,139 --> 00:52:47,358
decarboxylated so that's involves

661
00:52:44,108 --> 00:52:51,348
removing a carboxylic acid ring from the

662
00:52:47,358 --> 00:52:54,199
molecules so THC a becomes Delta

663
00:52:51,349 --> 00:52:57,410
tetrahydrocannabinol and CBD a becomes

664
00:52:54,199 --> 00:53:00,579
gamma dial so these are the different D

665
00:52:57,409 --> 00:53:03,409
acid you know removing that molecule

666
00:53:00,579 --> 00:53:06,589
activates these cannabinoids and this is

667
00:53:03,409 --> 00:53:09,139
how you can really improve the quality

668
00:53:06,588 --> 00:53:10,788
of the health of your body of audiences

669
00:53:09,139 --> 00:53:12,618
off your body but there it is right

670
00:53:10,789 --> 00:53:14,028
there that's basically what you want to

671
00:53:12,619 --> 00:53:16,579
eat that would be Moorhead when the

672
00:53:14,028 --> 00:53:19,998
house come around I want to be eating

673
00:53:16,579 --> 00:53:21,499
the 45 I mean the 73 and the 99% money

674
00:53:19,998 --> 00:53:23,568
yeah so you want to look at the

675
00:53:21,498 --> 00:53:25,429
saturation of THC and that's what they

676
00:53:23,568 --> 00:53:26,900
talk about with cancer so it's really

677
00:53:25,429 --> 00:53:28,399
you can do it with the Rick Simpson oil

678
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:32,499
is you can do with some people are

679
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:35,088
making it with what grain alcohol

680
00:53:32,498 --> 00:53:37,038
thank you and I make it with screens and

681
00:53:35,088 --> 00:53:40,958
we do it with screens and you know often

682
00:53:37,039 --> 00:53:44,089
coconut oil it seems to be a real nice

683
00:53:40,958 --> 00:53:47,509
sort of natural way that the dry sift

684
00:53:44,088 --> 00:53:49,268
and the wet wash melts just so nicely

685
00:53:47,509 --> 00:53:51,619
into the heated coconut oil

686
00:53:49,268 --> 00:53:53,598
decarboxylate sit and then allows you to

687
00:53:51,619 --> 00:53:55,400
either put it on your skin or eat it a

688
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:58,009
bit and and just put it on Pizza

689
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:58,449
anything you want right it's pretty

690
00:53:58,009 --> 00:54:03,438

723
00:56:41,219 --> 00:56:47,980
we got the terpene rich water that's my

724

personal product right there I'll be

725
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:54,269
pouring that into my plants and we'll

726
00:56:52,119 --> 00:56:57,490
see whether or not there's any

727
00:56:54,269 --> 00:56:59,019
real ability for a plant to uptake what

728
00:56:57,489 --> 00:57:02,500
do you guys think of that is there a way

729
00:56:59,019 --> 00:57:04,509
for a plant to uptake its its intake of

730
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:06,909
a particular thing to produce more

731
00:57:04,510 --> 00:57:09,910
terpenes I guess if we understood it

732
00:57:06,909 --> 00:57:13,389
that's possible I don't pretend to

733
00:57:09,909 --> 00:57:17,710
understand it the hash on the back of

734
00:57:13,389 --> 00:57:26,049

so anyway I was gonna give you this as

766
00:59:31,670 --> 00:59:37,170
for the birth of my son instead of a

767
00:59:34,710 --> 00:59:39,199
cigar that's that's awesome and if you

768
00:59:37,170 --> 00:59:40,920
feel like puffing it down at the water

769
00:59:39,199 --> 00:59:44,519
so be it

770
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:46,980
I don't wanna take it home you know D

771
00:59:44,519 --> 00:59:53,739
part two then here no

772
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:56,500
so I guess so I'm puffing this joint and

773
00:59:53,739 --> 00:59:57,579
one not a better time to puff it up what

774

01:00:04,329 --> 01:00:11,940
5:00 time perfect that is the birth of

well we made it to the water

780
01:00:27,099 --> 01:00:32,069

781
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:34,360
going to puff is pure house joint so

782

783
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:38,550
and do it on the dock or sit down

784
01:00:38,619 --> 01:00:46,750
I guess we'll figure it out you made a

785
01:00:46,030 --> 01:00:51,490
decision

786
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:55,989

whales and dolphins and different pods

815
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:51,039
of cool different fish salmon will be

816
01:02:45,789 --> 01:02:54,358
coming in I'm sure yeah the trap and

817
01:02:51,039 --> 01:02:54,358
crab and frog

818
01:02:55,840 --> 01:03:00,640
DOX even pretty empty there's not that

819
01:02:57,969 --> 01:03:03,579
many boats on and I really wish my boat

820
01:03:00,639 --> 01:03:04,839
was in the water so you know an idea

821
01:03:03,579 --> 01:03:06,429
maybe you could share what do you guys

822
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:08,620
doing a pup went they with us in the

823
01:03:06,429 --> 01:03:10,509
comments yeah tell us how you guys enjoy

824
01:03:08,619 --> 01:03:12,039
your puffs Wednesday are you guys

825
01:03:10,510 --> 01:03:14,350
inspired to do something special on

826
01:03:12,039 --> 01:03:16,059
Wednesday and get out there and pop some

827
01:03:14,349 --> 01:03:17,619
inspiration maybe we can do something

828
01:03:16,059 --> 01:03:19,329
different yeah we don't want to just sit

829
01:03:17,619 --> 01:03:21,069
in front of the same old same old spot

830
01:03:19,329 --> 01:03:23,590
so we try and come down to different

831
01:03:21,070 --> 01:03:24,820
venues show you an area that maybe

832
01:03:23,590 --> 01:03:26,320
haven't seen it before

833
01:03:24,820 --> 01:03:30,220
man I can't believe a resinous my mouth

834
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:32,530
is just for lighting this joint it's

835
01:03:30,219 --> 01:03:35,599
awesome that's one thing about just

836
01:03:32,530 --> 01:03:37,340
puffing on really nice residence

837
01:03:35,599 --> 01:03:38,960
we'd be talking a lot about that with a

838
01:03:37,340 --> 01:03:41,480
lot of people lately and ways asking

839
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:44,329
more more questions on the bubble hash

840
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:47,119
on hash on the trichomes how it's better

841
01:03:44,329 --> 01:03:48,289
for different equities and they know

842
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:50,960
there's a lot of good information that

843
01:03:48,289 --> 01:03:52,969
people want to know it's out there you

844
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:54,829
can find it but if you just want to come

845
01:03:52,969 --> 01:03:56,179
and pop a bowl and maybe catch a good

846
01:03:54,829 --> 01:03:57,949
tip here and there puff Wednesday's

847
01:03:56,179 --> 01:04:01,099
always a good spot to do it bubble man's

848
01:03:57,949 --> 01:04:04,039
world that looks pretty cool that looks

849
01:04:01,099 --> 01:04:06,889
pretty cool where people hold my gosh

850
01:04:04,039 --> 01:04:14,420
like you're gonna show this but I turned

851
01:04:06,889 --> 01:04:16,549
around saw that put a big smile on what

852
01:04:14,420 --> 01:04:19,730
usually happens after about 2 or 3 puffs

853
01:04:16,550 --> 01:04:21,830
on a pure hash joint after that it's I

854
01:04:19,730 --> 01:04:26,210
always say really it's an ideal thing

855
01:04:21,829 --> 01:04:31,690
for you know 10 people get each get like

856
01:04:26,210 --> 01:04:37,429
two or three really nice ribs you know

857
01:04:31,690 --> 01:04:40,519
sometimes maybe just yourself I'm not

858
01:04:37,429 --> 01:04:43,869
gonna lie I've done it as they know

859
01:04:40,519 --> 01:04:46,489
you've probably seen it on the channel

860
01:04:43,869 --> 01:04:48,589
now I could almost swim today it's such

861
01:04:46,489 --> 01:04:51,139
a beautiful day speaking of swimming

862
01:04:48,590 --> 01:04:52,430
there's kids swimming just literally on

863
01:04:51,139 --> 01:04:54,319
the other side of where we're hanging

864
01:04:52,429 --> 01:04:57,159
out right now surprise we can't hear

865
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:57,160
them screaming and yelling

866
01:05:00,130 --> 01:05:03,910
their hope for a swim

867
01:05:05,349 --> 01:05:08,800
sure would be nice though

868
01:05:11,289 --> 01:05:19,210
I can't believe what a gorgeous day it

869
01:05:15,070 --> 01:05:21,420
turned out to be yeah we've got some bad

870
01:05:19,210 --> 01:05:21,420
weather

871
01:05:24,599 --> 01:05:29,910
well I'm not sure we've had really bad

872
01:05:26,369 --> 01:05:33,749
weather I'd say it's more like just had

873
01:05:29,909 --> 01:05:36,460
a couple of days of rainy which I don't

874
01:05:33,748 --> 01:05:38,469
think we've had many in the entire

875
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:41,320
it kind of it was necessary to turn

876
01:05:38,469 --> 01:05:42,539
around but it's nice that even today it

877
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:46,059
didn't seem like it was going to be that

878
01:05:42,539 --> 01:05:48,009
beautiful that's beautiful it is it's

879
01:05:46,059 --> 01:05:50,799
better left on that joint though I have

880
01:05:48,010 --> 01:05:53,800
to say yeah well it'll just it'll

881
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:55,240
protect the cherry it kind of cools it

882
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:58,510
down and the burns are a little slow I

883
01:05:55,239 --> 01:06:00,459
just come yeah you get that - it'll heat

884
01:05:58,510 --> 01:06:03,369
up a bit more it's kind of like a cigar

885
01:06:00,460 --> 01:06:04,809
in that sense I think the big cherries

886
01:06:03,369 --> 01:06:06,519
on there so sometimes they left the ash

887
01:06:04,809 --> 01:06:08,349
build up I'm sure if you guys have heard

888
01:06:06,519 --> 01:06:12,130
that technique before letting the ash

889
01:06:08,349 --> 01:06:16,380
build up and creating a bit of a cooling

890
01:06:12,130 --> 01:06:18,610
effect on the cherry like a muffler

891
01:06:16,380 --> 01:06:19,150
we're like halfway through this hash

892
01:06:18,610 --> 01:06:22,829
joint

893
01:06:19,150 --> 01:06:26,260
I like how you know building up that

894
01:06:22,829 --> 01:06:27,880
that ash to put down the joint is

895
01:06:26,260 --> 01:06:29,560
something mana will be thought about

896
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:32,099
those little things that we learned

897
01:06:29,559 --> 01:06:32,099
little tips

898
01:06:32,659 --> 01:06:37,219
I love it kind of makes sense because

899
01:06:34,789 --> 01:06:39,500
after he said that I took a nice little

900
01:06:37,219 --> 01:06:41,419
pull and it burned my lips yeah well it

901
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:43,099
was even the first etiquette of those

902
01:06:41,420 --> 01:06:47,389
hash joints from the first video we

903
01:06:43,099 --> 01:06:49,369
always said don't don't hash it often

904
01:06:47,389 --> 01:06:50,750
it'll pull the cherry off and if it

905
01:06:49,369 --> 01:06:53,719
doesn't pull the cherry off just seems

906
01:06:50,750 --> 01:06:56,869
to make the cherry that much hotter but

907
01:06:53,719 --> 01:07:00,609
it's still tasting great of course

908
01:06:56,869 --> 01:07:00,609
the hash join is just a perfect shape

909
01:07:02,469 --> 01:07:07,459
great way to to puff a big session

910
01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:08,779
public we're surrounded there's people

911
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:10,460
working on boats over there there's a

912
01:07:08,780 --> 01:07:11,750
marina right over here of course if

913
01:07:10,460 --> 01:07:14,750
you're not much behind this in the sense

914
01:07:11,750 --> 01:07:16,909
of people but a lot of nature you know

915
01:07:14,750 --> 01:07:20,800
this this is like pulling up a rig and

916
01:07:16,909 --> 01:07:20,799
gabbing like Matt we've literally got

917
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:27,070
burning off here and about two-thirds of

918
01:07:24,159 --> 01:07:33,039
the way through it I could never get the

919
01:07:27,070 --> 01:07:35,260
effects right now it's hey so I was

920
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:38,289
laughing uh it's okay because the you

921
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:40,150
know I just couldn't believe that he

922
01:07:38,289 --> 01:07:42,849
steps on a rock this huge rock and it

923
01:07:40,150 --> 01:07:45,130
just twists fully sideways slides is put

924
01:07:42,849 --> 01:07:48,549
into a crevasse and then crushes up

925
01:07:45,130 --> 01:07:53,860
against his foot and he wasn't really

926
01:07:48,550 --> 01:07:55,330
screaming it was kind of like oh he's

927
01:07:53,860 --> 01:07:58,030
just kind of like the character that he

928
01:07:55,329 --> 01:08:10,269
is look at that big-ass that we got on

929
01:07:58,030 --> 01:08:12,820
there absolutely but but when you drop

930
01:08:10,269 --> 01:08:15,880
the joints and catch it in your hands if

931
01:08:12,820 --> 01:08:17,859
you do not be aschoff it was awesome

932
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:19,210
you know what it's just because we're

933
01:08:17,859 --> 01:08:21,640
being so delicate with it because could

934
01:08:19,210 --> 01:08:23,230
feel this is getting more is this is

935
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:25,569
when it becomes destroyed and here's the

936
01:08:23,229 --> 01:08:27,969
thing if you find at one point that it

937
01:08:25,569 --> 01:08:30,490
breaks in your fingers you can no longer

938
01:08:27,970 --> 01:08:31,838
pass it that's really the best thing I

939
01:08:30,489 --> 01:08:33,909
can say about the hash joint unless you

940
01:08:31,838 --> 01:08:35,649
have a pipe okay on the pipe that's

941
01:08:33,909 --> 01:08:37,329
different but if you don't have a pipe

942
01:08:35,649 --> 01:08:39,189
and you're puffing on one of these hash

943
01:08:37,329 --> 01:08:41,639
joints and you're towards the last a

944
01:08:39,189 --> 01:08:44,039
little bit of Roach one

945
01:08:41,639 --> 01:08:46,469
the wind hold it like this and add three

946
01:08:44,039 --> 01:08:48,810
fingers oh I see what you're saying yeah

947
01:08:46,469 --> 01:08:52,189
you get that real strong wave coming

948
01:08:48,810 --> 01:08:52,190
right now give it a shotgun rips

949
01:08:52,698 --> 01:08:59,649
turn the way to the wind then you get

950
01:08:54,689 --> 01:09:02,429
shotgun around and shot gonna look at

951
01:08:59,649 --> 01:09:05,548
shotgun reps on the ocean

952
01:09:02,430 --> 01:09:05,548
[Music]

953
01:09:06,298 --> 01:09:10,470
and warm on that roll and I'm gonna go

954
01:09:08,699 --> 01:09:12,599
look at the crusher crown careful to

955
01:09:10,470 --> 01:09:16,020
crack careful I would be strands fur and

956
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:17,789
fingers too much at that point it's damn

957
01:09:16,020 --> 01:09:20,010
near done but what a great joint that

958
01:09:17,789 --> 01:09:22,079
was this is it stays in five figures now

959
01:09:20,010 --> 01:09:24,180
cut don't pass it once it's cracked no

960
01:09:22,079 --> 01:09:26,278
bill passes so I got it finish it off by

961
01:09:24,180 --> 01:09:27,838
the time it's yours rips all the way

962
01:09:26,279 --> 01:09:32,220
through your garters for the finishing

963
01:09:27,838 --> 01:09:38,068

usually get into and just how great you

977
01:10:05,460 --> 01:10:11,369
know bubble and the whole cannabis scene

978
01:10:08,819 --> 01:10:15,389
fits right into it in my opinion a lot

979
01:10:11,369 --> 01:10:16,658
safer than an alcohol nice job done

980
01:10:15,390 --> 01:10:19,000
puffing that down home

981
01:10:16,658 --> 01:10:21,698
sucks having the eagle head over to that

982
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:22,579
character it's good couple sloths I'm

983
01:10:21,698 --> 01:10:24,919
chewing on

984
01:10:22,579 --> 01:10:26,449
get known to be good job I like the way

985
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:28,730
the winds really giving her ribs like

986
01:10:26,449 --> 01:10:31,019
you don't even have to suck on that

987
01:10:28,729 --> 01:10:34,689
together

988
01:10:31,020 --> 01:10:36,130
it's great that's it this is going break

989
01:10:34,689 --> 01:10:38,669
down to the nitty-gritty to the last

990
01:10:36,130 --> 01:10:38,670
breath

991
01:10:39,179 --> 01:10:44,010
see the awesome smoky Toki that's it

992
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:45,630
guys

993
01:10:44,010 --> 01:10:47,789
alright John great puffing with you on

994
01:10:45,630 --> 01:10:49,650
puff Wednesday hey congratulations

995
01:10:47,789 --> 01:10:52,350
we've got resin freezin in the freezer

996
01:10:49,649 --> 01:10:55,649
we don't get a collator today until

997
01:10:52,350 --> 01:10:57,179
tomorrow and get it then but I want to

998
01:10:55,649 --> 01:11:06,210
thank everyone for watching bubble man's

999
01:10:57,179 --> 01:11:07,770
world and puff-puff pass beef so I

1000
01:11:06,210 --> 01:11:10,100
looked over and I could see this little

1001
01:11:07,770 --> 01:11:12,750
bit of smoke coming up out of the zone

1002
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:17,520
and this is what we call organic guys

1003
01:11:12,750 --> 01:11:19,198
that little tiny piece won't go out it

1004
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:25,310
will just smolder away and I can't hold

1005
01:11:19,198 --> 01:11:25,309
that it's gonna burn my fingers awesome

1006
01:11:31,810 --> 01:11:37,310
hey guys bubbleman here back with the

1007
01:11:34,789 --> 01:11:40,189
final process the most important process

1008
01:11:37,310 --> 01:11:42,950
of making water hash the breaking up of

1009
01:11:40,189 --> 01:11:44,809
the final patty into powder so I've got

1010
01:11:42,949 --> 01:11:46,399
my 120 patty right here it's nice and

1011
01:11:44,810 --> 01:11:47,930
frozen so I'm not going to talk too much

1012
01:11:46,399 --> 01:11:51,759
because the freezing is an extremely

1013
01:11:47,930 --> 01:11:54,380
important factor I've got my 25

1014
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:58,369
parchment star sword my 120 parchment

1015
01:11:54,380 --> 01:12:00,800
here basically clean resin on it I've

1016
01:11:58,369 --> 01:12:02,390
cleaned my micro planer which isn't the

1017
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:04,810
greatest of micro planers it doesn't

1018
01:12:02,390 --> 01:12:06,829
have the strongest little bite to it but

1019
01:12:04,810 --> 01:12:10,039
it'll have to do

1020
01:12:06,829 --> 01:12:12,859
I also lost my gloves otherwise I would

1021
01:12:10,039 --> 01:12:15,619
be holding this with my gloves right now

1022
01:12:12,859 --> 01:12:18,619
this is this is really breaking up

1023
01:12:15,619 --> 01:12:20,119
lovely it's just starting to get sticky

1024
01:12:18,619 --> 01:12:24,189
on my hands now I probably could have

1025
01:12:20,119 --> 01:12:24,189
broken her down into a smaller piece

1026
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:34,130
it's coming out absolutely white this is

1027
01:12:28,789 --> 01:12:37,399
awesome just starting now to stick to my

1028
01:12:34,130 --> 01:12:40,850
fingers which is great because I've

1029
01:12:37,399 --> 01:12:42,529
pretty much got microplane down roll a

1030
01:12:40,850 --> 01:12:45,590
few little bump ease into the corner

1031
01:12:42,529 --> 01:12:49,069
there all right

1032
01:12:45,590 --> 01:12:50,480
so super important to make sure that you

1033
01:12:49,069 --> 01:12:52,699
get these pieces down as small as

1034
01:12:50,479 --> 01:12:54,439
possible these little pieces that are

1035
01:12:52,699 --> 01:12:56,989
stuck on my fingers of course probably

1036
01:12:54,439 --> 01:12:59,569
won't dry properly that's ok they're

1037
01:12:56,989 --> 01:13:02,300
just a few little rips oh no I'll just

1038
01:12:59,569 --> 01:13:06,939
hit those on the d-mail sizzle time as I

1039
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:06,940
call it get that little bit of sis okay

1040
01:13:07,569 --> 01:13:13,639
so I've gotten myself a tiny little bit

1041
01:13:10,939 --> 01:13:16,579
of a bubble stuck on my fingers here as

1042
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:19,670
you can see so what I would suggest for

1043
01:13:16,579 --> 01:13:21,260
this is into the freezer my fingers go

1044
01:13:19,670 --> 01:13:22,579
I'll leave them there for an hour and

1045
01:13:21,260 --> 01:13:23,030
then I'll pull them out now I'm just

1046
01:13:22,579 --> 01:13:24,680
kidding

1047
01:13:23,029 --> 01:13:25,909
you can do that with this tool right

1048
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:28,909
here which has a little bit of hash

1049
01:13:25,909 --> 01:13:32,569
stuck on it give that a little bit of a

1050
01:13:28,909 --> 01:13:35,239
whack and then even the finger that's

1051
01:13:32,569 --> 01:13:38,639
got all the resin on it can be cleaned

1052
01:13:35,239 --> 01:13:41,479
over top of the micro planing to

1053
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:44,119
there we go once

1054
01:13:41,479 --> 01:13:49,000
no resin shall be lost in the making of

1055
01:13:44,119 --> 01:13:49,000
this hash or harms for that reason

1056
01:13:57,590 --> 01:14:02,069
come on real nice

1057
01:13:59,779 --> 01:14:04,889
probably cuz I'm sitting in a nice cool

1058
01:14:02,069 --> 01:14:06,389
morning rather than the hot warmth of

1059
01:14:04,890 --> 01:14:09,660
the Sun that I often like to show you

1060
01:14:06,390 --> 01:14:13,800
guys what's going on so just give you a

1061
01:14:09,659 --> 01:14:15,689
little a little breakdown on that put it

1062
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:18,810
a little more even here I could have

1063
01:14:15,689 --> 01:14:20,399
dried it out a little more evenly but

1064
01:14:18,810 --> 01:14:23,539
it's gonna be fine and then I've got my

1065
01:14:20,399 --> 01:14:23,539
little chunks over here

1066
01:14:30,569 --> 01:14:37,589
come on ours cannot tell you how great

1067
01:14:35,488 --> 01:14:39,568
the smell on this is I'm gonna close up

1068
01:14:37,588 --> 01:14:41,729
the 120 box and we're gonna move on to

1069
01:14:39,569 --> 01:14:45,169
the 90 micron remember this is just the

1070
01:14:41,729 --> 01:14:53,399
first run as well we did end up getting

1071
01:14:45,168 --> 01:14:57,298
two runs of each all right so time for

1072
01:14:53,399 --> 01:15:01,489
the 90 a little remnants of some other

1073
01:14:57,298 --> 01:15:01,488
awesome melty hash I think it's Medi oh

1074
01:15:02,328 --> 01:15:07,918
yeah let's break off a little bit about

1075
01:15:04,588 --> 01:15:15,618
90 you can see how absolutely stunning

1076
01:15:07,918 --> 01:15:18,328
that is nice

1077
01:15:15,618 --> 01:15:20,848
suggest using smaller pieces when you're

1078
01:15:18,328 --> 01:15:23,298
planing so it doesn't heat up on your

1079
01:15:20,849 --> 01:15:23,298
fingers

1080
01:15:27,850 --> 01:15:38,350
that stayed cool right to the end

1081
01:15:32,670 --> 01:15:41,170
my fingers are sticky free squirrels

1082
01:15:38,350 --> 01:15:46,140
getting stoked keep him here and he's

1083
01:15:41,170 --> 01:15:48,430
like he's doing a nine-day cider

1084
01:15:46,140 --> 01:15:56,710
hey I'm getting pretty excited see the

1085
01:15:48,430 --> 01:15:59,130
smell on this is flavorful and switch

1086
01:15:56,710 --> 01:15:59,130
your upper

1087
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:16,880
corner out there

1088
01:16:21,679 --> 01:16:24,679
beautiful

1089
01:16:26,189 --> 01:16:36,210
nice powerline D right there my left

1090
01:16:31,380 --> 01:16:37,949
very little on the tool it's kind of the

1091
01:16:36,210 --> 01:16:40,050
key the more you leave on the tool the

1092
01:16:37,949 --> 01:16:42,329
more eventually the the less it'll work

1093
01:16:40,050 --> 01:16:43,770
so that's a tiny little bit in there but

1094
01:16:42,329 --> 01:16:46,470
for the most part you can see I got the

1095
01:16:43,770 --> 01:16:51,030
job done that's because this was in the

1096
01:16:46,470 --> 01:16:55,230
freezer the whole time so ninety you get

1097
01:16:51,029 --> 01:16:58,619
put away move on to the 73 alright so

1098
01:16:55,229 --> 01:17:00,899
I'll be 273 can see I've got the 73

1099
01:16:58,619 --> 01:17:03,059
micron written here and then each time I

1100
01:17:00,899 --> 01:17:05,579
do a new drop I just write in the date

1101
01:17:03,060 --> 01:17:07,950
and what it is I've done three other

1102
01:17:05,579 --> 01:17:09,869
Astro boys on this one and a many cush

1103
01:17:07,949 --> 01:17:12,840
to other Astra for the mini push this

1104
01:17:09,869 --> 01:17:15,930
will be the third got the parchment

1105
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:19,460
lined in the cardboard I'm gonna break

1106
01:17:15,930 --> 01:17:22,289
this 73 in half it's already becoming

1107
01:17:19,460 --> 01:17:32,730
goopy look at the way the light shine to

1108
01:17:22,289 --> 01:17:36,210
that here's some top pretty excited down

1109
01:17:32,729 --> 01:17:38,899
there you must know I'm micro planing

1110
01:17:36,210 --> 01:17:38,899
the 73

1111
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:55,219
actually one of the nice things about

1112
01:17:53,328 --> 01:17:57,590
this micro planar because it isn't quite

1113
01:17:55,219 --> 01:18:02,960
as sharp some of the some of the other

1114
01:17:57,590 --> 01:18:07,039
models it's a well [ __ ] down my recipe

1115
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:17,210
pieces just with your fingers doing no

1116
01:18:07,039 --> 01:18:28,059
damage to your finger kind of sweet just

1117
01:18:17,210 --> 01:18:28,059
looking real nice 7373 saying 73

1118
01:18:35,859 --> 01:18:40,069
kind of a little bit of moisture on your

1119
01:18:37,969 --> 01:18:42,908
fingers tighten a little bit of little

1120
01:18:40,069 --> 01:18:46,549
moisture can just make that excess

1121
01:18:42,908 --> 01:18:49,698
sticky sticky resin roll off without

1122
01:18:46,550 --> 01:18:53,090
actually sticking onto your lunch your

1123
01:18:49,698 --> 01:18:57,919
finger so see that's pretty pretty good

1124
01:18:53,090 --> 01:19:01,659
for for just having manhandled it out

1125
01:18:57,920 --> 01:19:01,658
one more little piece here

1126
01:19:18,569 --> 01:19:25,149
it's coming out so white it's incredible

1127
01:19:21,929 --> 01:19:26,829
looks quite a nice amber color in chunks

1128
01:19:25,149 --> 01:19:33,460
but I'll tell you once it gets down to

1129
01:19:26,829 --> 01:19:35,819
being microplane is a very nice blonde

1130
01:19:33,460 --> 01:19:35,819
color

1131
01:19:57,800 --> 01:20:03,779
pretty good still clean on the fingers

1132
01:20:00,770 --> 01:20:05,900
no skin popping off into the hash looks

1133
01:20:03,779 --> 01:20:11,699
pretty darn good

1134
01:20:05,899 --> 01:20:14,309
well that's the 73 done 45 and 25 left

1135
01:20:11,699 --> 01:20:19,199
and then I'll go and microplane the

1136
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:21,360
second run looks like the second run is

1137
01:20:19,199 --> 01:20:23,250
a little a little bit more than half the

1138
01:20:21,359 --> 01:21:21,149
return I'd say maybe two thirds maybe a

1139
01:20:23,250 --> 01:21:23,340
half and I'm gonna put this one away or

1140
01:21:21,149 --> 01:21:27,569
three weeks but to me it feels like a

1141
01:21:23,340 --> 01:21:31,890
month or months so I'm gonna go get the

1142
01:21:27,569 --> 01:21:33,659
45 to do exclusive 45 in here it looks

1143
01:21:31,890 --> 01:21:37,320
like it's quite a bit better quality

1144
01:21:33,659 --> 01:21:39,659
than the 25 so we're gonna dab a little

1145
01:21:37,319 --> 01:21:41,969
bit of this 45 because it looks so darn

1146
01:21:39,659 --> 01:21:46,529
good all right so we went and grabbed

1147
01:21:41,969 --> 01:21:52,020
our 45 patty see it's been in the

1148
01:21:46,529 --> 01:21:54,859
freezer all night and it is awesome this

1149
01:21:52,020 --> 01:22:01,470
is a nice 45 patty I'm gonna break it

1150
01:21:54,859 --> 01:22:04,259
into a few chunks Wow that was quite a

1151
01:22:01,470 --> 01:22:07,590
nice snap mainly because I don't want it

1152
01:22:04,260 --> 01:22:18,000
warming up in my fingers before I have

1153
01:22:07,590 --> 01:22:21,779
the chance to micro flame it this piece

1154
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:24,170
is really hard I can feel it wanting to

1155
01:22:21,779 --> 01:22:27,389
warm up in my fingers but staying cool

1156
01:22:24,170 --> 01:22:29,579
right down to the last piece I find it

1157
01:22:27,390 --> 01:22:31,440
it is also helpful which I'm just

1158
01:22:29,579 --> 01:22:36,869
noticing now particularly with this 45

1159
01:22:31,439 --> 01:22:38,549
to have that tiny little bit of moisture

1160
01:22:36,869 --> 01:22:41,090
on the outside you saw when I held up

1161
01:22:38,550 --> 01:22:44,460
the piece that had almost like a little

1162
01:22:41,090 --> 01:22:47,750
little frozen water on the outside of

1163
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:50,069
the hash this is quite a helpful thing

1164
01:22:47,750 --> 01:22:52,460
particularly for keeping the hash from

1165
01:22:50,069 --> 01:22:55,380
sticking to your fingers and the tool I

1166
01:22:52,460 --> 01:22:59,220
mean a little bit of moisture is the key

1167
01:22:55,380 --> 01:23:01,050
we know that it's it's the key in

1168
01:22:59,220 --> 01:23:08,940
sieving and of course it's going to be

1169
01:23:01,050 --> 01:23:12,500
the key in micro planing all right it's

1170
01:23:08,939 --> 01:23:12,500
great also coming out very light

1171
01:23:30,449 --> 01:23:34,409
Michael cleaning up just lovely

1172
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:44,238
it's kind of apart right here that

1173
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:47,480
you're watching this sort of last

1174
01:23:44,238 --> 01:23:51,019
awkward part that many people have the

1175
01:23:47,479 --> 01:23:53,569
most problem with and that's why I'm

1176
01:23:51,020 --> 01:23:57,980
going to show you all of it in all of

1177
01:23:53,569 --> 01:23:59,569
its awkwardness and yes you can mix it

1178
01:23:57,979 --> 01:24:01,069
up you can wear the rubber gloves you

1179
01:23:59,569 --> 01:24:03,259
can you know I'm gonna be photographing

1180
01:24:01,069 --> 01:24:04,880
my resin to clarify that it won't be

1181
01:24:03,260 --> 01:24:07,030
full of skin I can tell it's not full of

1182
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:09,710
skin mine and my fingers haven't

1183
01:24:07,029 --> 01:24:17,090
released any skin and it all looks good

1184
01:24:09,710 --> 01:24:22,239
from here this 45 is definitely

1185
01:24:17,090 --> 01:24:22,239
releasing some lovely terpenes

1186
01:24:49,378 --> 01:24:55,090
that's relatively clean starting to gum

1187
01:24:53,229 --> 01:24:59,859
up a tiny little bit on the outside here

1188
01:24:55,090 --> 01:25:02,019
on this side sure which show me that

1189
01:24:59,859 --> 01:25:04,679
it's time for a cleaning it's best to

1190
01:25:02,019 --> 01:25:07,809
keep your tools clean and not try and

1191
01:25:04,679 --> 01:25:11,918
you know force the batch over a dirty

1192
01:25:07,809 --> 01:25:18,010
tool I'll clean this tool and before I

1193
01:25:11,918 --> 01:25:20,498
microplane the 25-man how do I clean it

1194
01:25:18,010 --> 01:25:23,439
I clean it with a little bit of 99% of

1195
01:25:20,498 --> 01:25:25,889
isopropanol and that pretty much gets

1196
01:25:23,439 --> 01:25:25,889
the job done

1197
01:25:35,090 --> 01:25:40,610
you wanna barf there bud and hear the

1198
01:25:38,250 --> 01:25:46,850
other dogs barking you're feeling it

1199
01:25:40,609 --> 01:25:46,849
don't hold back all right

1200
01:25:54,739 --> 01:25:58,609
nice passion 45

1201
01:25:59,539 --> 01:26:08,159
nothing wrong with that

1202
01:26:02,090 --> 01:26:12,480
some Grammys last up is the 25 which I'm

1203
01:26:08,159 --> 01:26:15,239
gonna put in the 191 60 bucks because

1204
01:26:12,479 --> 01:26:17,489
what I ended up getting for 190 and 160

1205
01:26:15,239 --> 01:26:18,960
was literally nothing I'll try to take a

1206
01:26:17,489 --> 01:26:21,899
picture of it it's just a little stain

1207
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:26,840
on the pressing screen next up 25 micron

1208
01:26:21,899 --> 01:26:30,750
alright so we've got the last there's a

1209
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:37,409
swag a hash on here - only on bubble

1210
01:26:30,750 --> 01:26:41,430
man's world this looks really good

1211
01:26:37,409 --> 01:26:46,170
actually it looks more like a 45 or even

1212
01:26:41,430 --> 01:26:50,850
a 120 then a 160 and a 1 we'll keep that

1213
01:26:46,170 --> 01:26:54,960
for later - bonus so should open my

1214
01:26:50,850 --> 01:26:58,920
pizza boxes more often that has been

1215
01:26:54,960 --> 01:27:02,010
curing for a long time all right so we

1216
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:05,779
got the 25 micron there beautiful color

1217
01:27:02,010 --> 01:27:08,460
on that real nice and light caramel e

1218
01:27:05,779 --> 01:27:10,559
we're just gonna do a light microphone

1219
01:27:08,460 --> 01:27:14,239
yes I've cleaned the microplane like I

1220
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:14,240
said crystal clear

1221
01:27:17,020 --> 01:27:25,660
this is just playing to perfection as I

1222
01:27:22,909 --> 01:27:25,659
assumed it would

1223
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:44,220
nice even spread when you're doing this

1224
01:27:40,590 --> 01:27:46,319
is very important I still you know

1225
01:27:44,220 --> 01:27:48,090
without the closing of the box I don't

1226
01:27:46,319 --> 01:27:49,559
think I would use the parchment by

1227
01:27:48,090 --> 01:27:52,170
itself just here in the Pacific

1228
01:27:49,560 --> 01:27:54,300
Northwest we really have a humidity

1229
01:27:52,170 --> 01:27:58,500
problem and it's hard to dry bubble

1230
01:27:54,300 --> 01:28:00,539
properly and I find that that's why I

1231
01:27:58,500 --> 01:28:02,250
never would put it on a plate or a you

1232
01:28:00,539 --> 01:28:05,819
know when he took plastic or anything it

1233
01:28:02,250 --> 01:28:08,850
it need to go on a desiccant so I don't

1234
01:28:05,819 --> 01:28:10,500
mind this with the box that closes over

1235
01:28:08,850 --> 01:28:11,970
it because then it still gets the effect

1236
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:14,850
of the desiccant without even being

1237
01:28:11,970 --> 01:28:17,030
directly in contact with it and then

1238
01:28:14,850 --> 01:28:21,740
everyone else is happy too because

1239
01:28:17,029 --> 01:28:31,319
except so nice off the parchment alright

1240
01:28:21,739 --> 01:28:36,289
so there's the twenty five we've got our

1241
01:28:31,319 --> 01:28:39,630
variety of gland sizes microplaned up

1242
01:28:36,289 --> 01:28:42,720
boxed up so no dust debris hair whatever

1243
01:28:39,630 --> 01:28:44,880
the wind whatever it can't happen

1244
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:46,470
it's in the box it's safe I'll take

1245
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:48,090
these now and I'll go put them in a room

1246
01:28:46,470 --> 01:28:50,220
that's gonna be about sixty five degrees

1247
01:28:48,090 --> 01:28:54,289
Fahrenheit with a humidity of about

1248
01:28:50,220 --> 01:28:56,490
twenty percent got a dehumidifier on and

1249
01:28:54,289 --> 01:29:00,300
probably let this dry for the next five

1250
01:28:56,489 --> 01:29:02,059
to seven days depending on if my friends

1251
01:29:00,300 --> 01:29:05,460
don't show up who the from the Seattle

1252
01:29:02,060 --> 01:29:09,120
cannabis cup if giddy and Tony and bird

1253
01:29:05,460 --> 01:29:12,600
show up and jibs then we are dipping

1254
01:29:09,119 --> 01:29:14,039
into the fresh frozen so anyway I hope

1255
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:16,710
you guys learned a little something new

1256
01:29:14,039 --> 01:29:19,050
if you have any questions oh there's my

1257

1258
01:29:19,050 --> 01:29:22,920
gonna have to go if you have any

1259
