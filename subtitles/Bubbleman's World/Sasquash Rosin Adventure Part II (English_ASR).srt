28
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:52,340
yeah we have a tool to uh great Carter

29
00:01:47,959 --> 00:02:18,609

30
00:01:52,340 --> 00:02:51,310

32
00:02:51,519 --> 00:03:01,810
oh yeah just press

33
00:03:02,689 --> 00:03:05,960
and then we've got a whole swath of

34
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:11,560
other things to press I'm going to come

35
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:11,560
in nice and close with the camera real

36
00:03:19,389 --> 00:03:44,689
super fast you don't have any oil

37
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:46,819
traveling through any plant matter to

38
00:03:44,689 --> 00:04:01,430
try to escape just say it's all this

39
00:03:46,819 --> 00:04:05,299
isn't there about pressing the hash is

40
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:11,200
prepared there was another five seven

41
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:15,020
5.7 grams yet in the folded parchment

42
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:16,519
plugs to get plates repaired first a

43
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:19,040
little bit I was just gonna say get your

44
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:21,979
parts man your plates prepared get to

45
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,410
like the size open that you need to just

46
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:27,500
push it in gently so it's not too tight

47
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:30,050
but slides in nice and also so your bag

48
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:37,939
doesn't open lip open exactly that's a

49
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:43,810
really good main point the plates keep

50
00:04:37,939 --> 00:04:48,969
it down for - I always going magnet a

51
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:53,620
quarter inch to a half inch depending on

52
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:56,830
how much you think the expansion of bag

53
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:56,829
will be

54
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:08,669
what's that I always like to keep

55
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:11,790
everything tight this is your pre-press

56
00:05:08,668 --> 00:05:15,060
right now yeah when how many of those

57
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:17,040
cranks on the UM and pump Lee probably

58
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:18,990
towards honestly with this it's I'm just

59
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:22,020
gonna ease into the pressure really

60
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:26,060
slowly you can see it already starting

61
00:05:22,019 --> 00:05:26,060
to melt through the bag mm-hmm

62
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:49,240
literally as I push it's pushing it out

63
00:05:44,389 --> 00:05:49,240
yeah that's great

64
00:06:05,769 --> 00:06:17,539
what's that the bags pushing out a bit

65
00:06:08,209 --> 00:06:20,599
just a tiny bit he pulled the whole

66
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:23,180
parchment on the back through very

67
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:25,250
simple but very effective no need to

68
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:26,420
open it up and try to push it back into

69
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:29,600
the parchment when there's a oil

70
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:31,370
everywhere those one pulled all the

71
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:42,290
parchment rolls Chinese straightening

72
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:44,959
paper out in the beginning show a little

73
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:48,170
bit there still we're still pressing

74
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:53,719
rosin just till then our money shot to

75
00:06:48,170 --> 00:07:01,250
come let's see it coming up again making

76
00:06:53,720 --> 00:07:05,110
its way to the edge low and slow working

77
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:05,110
anything super super good

78
00:07:20,529 --> 00:07:28,039
let's say we're pretty much good

79
00:07:23,029 --> 00:07:31,639
pressure no need to really slim down on

80
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:37,189
hash you don't want to blow up the bag

81
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:40,550
or anything but uh I didn't pack a too

82
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:57,439
fat so yeah it was just five grams right

83
00:07:40,550 --> 00:08:00,500
so wow this meats gonna flavor bag is

84
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:04,399
just so definitely gonna get water there

85
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:06,800
yeah so if you're gonna do second press

86
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:10,250
hold it the best thing to do is do it

87
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:12,680
right away okay well it's gonna be super

88
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:18,889
tasty this is because of the low low

89
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:21,470
temperature yeah that it uh did that

90
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:23,509
it's just a sweet sweet color on there

91
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:24,470
but with the second dress I always like

92
00:08:23,509 --> 00:08:26,959
to keep it warm

93
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:30,050
yeah and do it right away so that you

94
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:34,789
don't have to reheat it again you just

95
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:37,310
kind of start as mash sense makes sense

96
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:42,769
see you're in there already smashing

97
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:45,079
round two on the first batch get some

98
00:08:42,769 --> 00:08:47,000
nice pressure on what I did to the full

99
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:49,340
of it enhanced oh yeah I always do that

100
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,370
as well take it like that sometimes I'll

101
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:55,100
even fold it a second time it's a really

102
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:57,350
big like 30 grams of hash or something

103
00:08:55,100 --> 00:09:01,629
yeah and I'll fold it twice

104
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:01,629
make a quarter yeah

105
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:07,850
there's a bloody paper yeah you do that

106
00:09:36,049 --> 00:09:40,588
she hit it the right temperature not the

107
00:09:39,059 --> 00:09:42,719
right temperature but a higher

108
00:09:40,589 --> 00:09:45,750
temperature you will extract every

109
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:57,290
little piece of oil out there's no need

110
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:57,289
to go back definitely be some fire soon

111
00:10:01,578 --> 00:10:08,188
no proper patio really like in the wrong

112
00:10:06,089 --> 00:10:10,019
place for the lighting - oh I can't

113
00:10:08,188 --> 00:10:12,480
it usually has to be like natural Sun or

114
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:16,339
something good for anything this lens is

115
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,339
so big it just comes of shade

116
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:24,629
yeah this is nice so there's a little

117
00:10:21,929 --> 00:10:27,049
bit more coming out now it's a lovely

118
00:10:24,629 --> 00:10:27,049
color

119
00:10:30,019 --> 00:10:35,059
the bags in the camera look like the

120
00:10:32,059 --> 00:10:38,059
plates what's that

121
00:10:35,059 --> 00:10:40,699
the lines on the screen so I just Center

122
00:10:38,059 --> 00:10:52,819
the yeah but it looks like the rosin

123
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:56,450
plate really nice go see if it missing

124
00:10:52,820 --> 00:11:01,990
or looks pretty boring she's going full

125
00:10:56,450 --> 00:11:01,990
of dread about to go

126
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:24,629
all right let's get her out this time

127
00:11:26,578 --> 00:11:31,599
now there's the yield and you can tell

128
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:49,989
right away look at how light this is now

129
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:53,470
this is the mobility what is it a gram

130
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:53,860
yeah the first process the ground so

131
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:56,769
what's that

132
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:58,930
I guarantee turning eyes and presses

133
00:11:56,769 --> 00:12:01,720
again and getting more from five grams

134
00:11:58,929 --> 00:12:05,828
that's like that so that was that's dude

135
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:07,360
this is gonna be a high yield that's

136
00:12:05,828 --> 00:12:11,189
that's exactly one gram

137
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,190
it's literally exactly dude look at that

138
00:12:13,259 --> 00:12:25,169
the texture on this yeah oh geez the

139
00:12:19,899 --> 00:12:25,169
texture is really gonna come hit this

140
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:31,769
the wind it's such a nice color

141
00:12:38,139 --> 00:13:09,110
look at that nice twittering right there

hand behind it real close but thank you

148
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:27,530

149
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:30,080
it's locked onto the rosin and your

150
00:13:27,529 --> 00:13:31,759

165
