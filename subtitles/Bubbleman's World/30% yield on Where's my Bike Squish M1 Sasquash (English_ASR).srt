2
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:12,910
hey guys welcome back to bubble man's

3
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:14,948
world I am here with the where is my

4
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:17,050
bike like I promised part two of the

5
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:20,559
last video from maple butter reviews

6
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:23,410
I've been waiting for a sunny day so I

7
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:26,469
could share that beautiful sunny sunny

8
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:27,879
light to produce this wonderful rosin

9
00:00:26,469 --> 00:00:29,710
that we're about to make here today but

10
00:00:27,879 --> 00:00:31,149
you know what I thought the rains have

11
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:32,950
started here on the west coast and the

12
00:00:31,149 --> 00:00:36,460
Pacific Northwest it's not about to stop

13
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:39,790
anytime soon and I figured no time like

14
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:40,630
the present to open up these buds and

15
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:42,609
check them out

16
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:46,060
alright so without further ado let's

17
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:48,100
crack these whereas my bikes really

18
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:49,000
excited about this imagine I've had this

19
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:54,910
for almost a week

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:57,909
oh my god oh that smell reminds me so

21
00:00:54,909 --> 00:01:00,988
much of at Amsterdam that is an

22
00:00:57,909 --> 00:01:08,949
Amsterdam smell I'm really like strong

23
00:01:00,988 --> 00:01:10,509
Amsterdam lemony goodness so I would

24
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:12,909
guess that right there is about a five

25
00:01:10,509 --> 00:01:14,259
Grammer and I would guess this right

26
00:01:12,909 --> 00:01:16,929
here is a five Grammer so it looks like

27
00:01:14,259 --> 00:01:19,179
we got 10 grams so 10 grams should

28
00:01:16,929 --> 00:01:22,240
squish out about 3 grams of rosin if

29
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:24,359
we're lucky and we get that 30% I'm

30
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:26,798
gonna take some macro shots of this bud

31
00:01:24,358 --> 00:01:28,568
so I can share the beautiful resin

32
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:31,090
that's on here with you and then we're

33
00:01:28,569 --> 00:01:32,978
gonna get disc wishing all right so I

34
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:34,810
took the but apart and photographed on

35
00:01:32,978 --> 00:01:38,938
the inside you can see here that this

36
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:41,769
bud with the tared screen nice 5.1 grams

37
00:01:38,938 --> 00:01:45,519
this one came in a little bit less at

38
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:47,918
like four point something 4.8 4.9 I

39
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:50,918
believe it was so four point nine so

40
00:01:47,918 --> 00:01:54,929
between those two buds we have a 5 or 10

41
00:01:50,918 --> 00:01:57,009
grams or nine point nine close enough

42
00:01:54,929 --> 00:02:00,090
and we're gonna get ready to put it

43
00:01:57,009 --> 00:02:00,090
through bubble man's world

44
00:02:06,549 --> 00:02:12,500
Booya all right so I have broken down

45
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:16,250
the 1 but gotta say barely touching it

46
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:19,759
man it got my fingers sticky

47
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:23,209
I mean sticky icky where you could pick

48
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:26,629
up a scale you know that kind of sticky

49
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:28,819
icky that's sticky icky right there it's

50
00:02:26,629 --> 00:02:30,560
pretty heavy object anyway of course

51
00:02:28,818 --> 00:02:32,179
many of you use doing this on a

52
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,099
commercial level for patients would be

53
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:36,739
wearing gloves and it would be a lot

54
00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:38,689
cleaner this is in my yard this is for

55
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:41,209
my personal and I'm not gonna wear

56
00:02:38,689 --> 00:02:43,789
gloves for my personal all I really did

57
00:02:41,209 --> 00:02:47,030
was I broke that butt up into smaller

58
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:50,799
remnant pieces and you can see there

59
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:55,189
it's ready to go in the screen I've also

60
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:56,719
already kind of pre done where one of

61
00:02:55,189 --> 00:02:58,310
the tricks that sasquatch talks about is

62
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:01,699
getting the holes filled up on the

63
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:04,069
screen into the corners so that's kind

64
00:03:01,699 --> 00:03:05,750
of the most important part as your as

65
00:03:04,068 --> 00:03:08,208
your lightly filling this and this is

66
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:13,310
gonna be hilarious because this bud is

67
00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:16,159
so [ __ ] sticky talk about a challenge

68
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:17,870
Wow nice nice nice challenge to have I

69
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,090
gotta say everyone else out there you

70
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:23,269
need to step your [ __ ] up on growing I

71
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:24,769
am seeing some absolutely pathetic bud

72
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:27,799
these days that people are really

73
00:03:24,769 --> 00:03:29,450
thinking is the is the greatness and I

74
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:30,409
hear people calling out everyone oh they

75
00:03:29,449 --> 00:03:32,328
don't know how to grow they don't know

76
00:03:30,409 --> 00:03:35,090
how to grow well you know what maybe

77
00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:41,359
don't throw stones if you live in a

78
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:42,500
glass house hey alright alright well I'm

79
00:03:41,359 --> 00:03:43,909
not gonna film this whole thing this is

80
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:48,319
gonna take me a while I'll come back

81
00:03:43,909 --> 00:03:50,479
when we are fully full alright so we got

82
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:53,989
that nicely packed you can see the bumps

83
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:55,518
in the bud it's just sticky icky really

84
00:03:53,989 --> 00:04:00,890
looking forward to getting this press so

85
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:03,650
let's see what we got shall we hey guys

86
00:04:00,889 --> 00:04:05,869
bubble man here just waiting for my

87
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:07,189
temperature to drop down to 220 might

88
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:09,379
seem a little high for some of you guys

89
00:04:07,189 --> 00:04:10,639
but for this particular cultivar with

90
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:15,019
the moisture content

91
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:19,250
it's usually pretty perfect about my pad

92
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:25,670
right here we got we're getting close

93
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:39,680
we're getting close yeah real excited

94
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:41,000
about this press all right pushing it in

95
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,680
a fair bit you don't want it sitting

96
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,810
right on the edge I know it's nice to

97
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:47,300
see the resin pouring out but if you put

98
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:49,670
your pad too far close to the edge you

99
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:51,079
can end up getting it pinched and you

100
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:53,240
can get a blowout depending on how much

101
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:55,930
pressure you're using so uh let's get

102
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,930
this going shall we

103
00:05:27,649 --> 00:05:30,769
[Music]

104
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:51,569
try to remember that's Bud in there

105
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:55,669
everyone that is bud

106
00:05:51,569 --> 00:05:55,669
that is not hash

107
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:06,470
color is absolutely perfect and I wish

108
00:06:04,939 --> 00:06:09,949
you could smell this the resin is coming

109
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:15,190
out both sides of the press and our trip

110
00:06:09,949 --> 00:06:15,189
is is continuing to grow

111
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:31,159
oh yeah so we're for the camera motion

112
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:34,759
of course just trying to get you guys

113
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:37,370
the best the best possible view for this

114
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:41,149
little press remember we only put five

115
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:43,610
grams of of material in of Bud so we're

116
00:06:41,149 --> 00:06:47,049
looking to get maybe a gram and a half a

117
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:50,050
gram and a half we'll put us at the 30%

118
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:50,050
range

119
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:29,899
I say we even have a tiny little bit of

120
00:07:26,689 --> 00:07:31,269
a press left there and there's what we

121
00:07:29,899 --> 00:07:44,870
got

122
00:07:31,269 --> 00:07:47,899
so we shall collect all right so there's

123
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:50,689
what we got I'm not sure if it's gonna

124
00:07:47,899 --> 00:07:51,310
be that gram and a half but let's check

125
00:07:50,689 --> 00:07:55,399
it out

126
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:58,430
all right so there it is 1.5 grams on

127
00:07:55,399 --> 00:08:00,469
the scale thought it was gonna come a

128
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:02,720
little short I'm not gonna lie I feel

129
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:05,240
like there's at least a tiny little bit

130
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,640
maybe a point one you can see it kind of

131
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:09,259
in the screen there so we're gonna try

132
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:12,500
pressing this one more time and see what

133
00:08:09,259 --> 00:08:20,029
we can't get always good to do a second

134
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:22,279
run with quality of this level all right

135
00:08:20,029 --> 00:08:26,739
so just like I thought a very very

136
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:29,359
little bit left not a ton

137
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:32,779
maybe that point one that I was talking

138
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:35,210
about but all right so that was a nice

139
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:37,309
little squish as I kind of figured it

140
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:39,230
would be the last little bit that I

141
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:42,500
squished it's coming up between point 1

142
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:46,279
and point 2 the original squish that I

143
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:49,549
did came at like 1.4 1.5 so I would say

144
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:51,740
we're probably accurately sitting at 30%

145
00:08:49,549 --> 00:08:54,500
some people might add it up and say oh I

146
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:56,539
got thirty four percent 30 it's unlikely

147
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:59,090
it's because of this scale only goes to

148
00:08:56,539 --> 00:09:00,500
one point that and the way it was

149
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:03,110
flickering between one point four and

150
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:05,990
one point five I would say accurately

151
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:10,960
combined out of that five grams we got

152
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:15,649
about 1.5 and look at the quality of

153
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:18,080
said rosin I mean let me tell you I had

154
00:09:15,649 --> 00:09:20,449
a I had one guy comment on my video

155
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,509
recently saying that I was being paid by

156
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:24,490
maple butter to do these reviews

157
00:09:22,509 --> 00:09:26,319
you think I gotta be paid to do a review

158
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:28,509
like that are you [ __ ] kidding me

159
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:32,980
that was the stickiest bud that I've

160
00:09:28,509 --> 00:09:35,350
handled in a long long long time I'm

161
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:37,960
telling you I'm very very impressed with

162
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:40,240
these maple butter guys they're

163
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:42,780
producing the flame and shout-out to

164
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:46,480
Carmen genetics for this beautiful cross

165
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:48,669
of amnesia haze crossed with the biker

166
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,500
Kush the amnesia haze is the super

167
00:09:48,669 --> 00:09:53,589
Silver Haze or the haze crossed with

168
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:56,139
haze times skunk number one crossed with

169
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:58,930
haze times haze the super Silver Haze

170
00:09:56,139 --> 00:10:01,960
again crossed with Northern Lights

171
00:09:58,929 --> 00:10:04,089
number five I believe and the biker Kush

172
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:06,370
is the Hells Angels og crossed with the

173
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:09,519
Lucifer og when you put them both

174
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:10,269
together you got to seriously go find

175
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,279
your bike

176
00:10:10,269 --> 00:10:13,899
why don't we pest press up another quick

177
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:18,759
medallion while we're here and we'll

178
00:10:13,899 --> 00:10:19,870
call it a day sound good guys hey guys

179
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:21,370
so for those of you that want to know a

180
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:22,990
little bit of an easier way to fill

181
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,970
these screens and I'm sure most of you

182
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:27,759
have been on this ball but basically a

183
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:30,070
little business card sliding it in like

184
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:33,250
that and just pushing your material down

185
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:34,690
whether it be hash or herb is really

186
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:36,940
nice it works great you can pull out the

187
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:39,220
card and you've got a perfectly filled

188
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:41,580
bag and then of course it's just a

189
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:43,779
matter of massaging it a little bit

190
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:46,870
softening it up and making sure that you

191
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:48,819
fill up any of those holes because we

192
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:51,929
don't want these little holes they they

193
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:54,390
try so desperately there we go

194
00:10:51,929 --> 00:10:58,559
just push that material down and work it

195
00:10:54,389 --> 00:11:00,629
all into the base of the screen and well

196
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:03,088
you see you saw from my last press that

197
00:11:00,629 --> 00:11:05,939
obviously I was fairly efficient with it

198
00:11:03,089 --> 00:11:07,680
I'd say I got about 90 plus percent out

199
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:09,270
of my first press and that's why we

200
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:10,559
pressed a little bit warmer and for a

201
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:13,110
little bit longer that was about a

202
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:15,059
minute and 50 seconds that I pressed the

203
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:18,778
last batch for and let me tell ya I just

204
00:11:15,059 --> 00:11:20,669
had a dab off the camera on point so

205
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:24,139
without further ado let's get to the

206
00:11:20,669 --> 00:11:30,509
next press all right so we're back

207
00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:32,480
parchment in our magnets attached it's

208
00:11:30,509 --> 00:11:42,419
always nice to see what's going on

209
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:44,930
catch the drip all right as Matt

210
00:11:42,419 --> 00:11:48,769
mentioned from sasquatch leave this up

211
00:11:44,929 --> 00:11:51,179
it'll make it easier for you to pick the

212
00:11:48,769 --> 00:11:54,629
rosin

213
00:11:51,179 --> 00:11:56,399
well not the rosin but the the packet up

214
00:11:54,629 --> 00:11:58,500
of herb it'll make it easier for you to

215
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,470
pick up because that little flap will be

216
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:03,299
sitting there and it'll it'll avoid you

217
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:05,879
accidentally pushing the little screen

218
00:12:03,299 --> 00:12:11,338
packet into your freshly pressed rosin

219
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:14,970
so try to avoid that go down for a mild

220
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:18,140
pre-press just like a 10 second or even

221
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:18,139
all right here we go

222
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:36,480

[Music]

234
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:35,639
feels pretty proper got a little bit of

235
00:14:34,179 --> 00:14:48,719
butter about 1

236
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:51,429

Oh

00:15:01,009 --> 00:15:11,289
[Music]

241
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:11,289
alright let's see what we got

242
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:21,399
so we came in again at 1.5 1.6 even I

243
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:25,649
think the tear is a little off but yeah

244
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:30,669
that is impressive that is impressive

245
00:15:25,649 --> 00:15:34,360
another solid 30% see how it moves 1.4

246
00:15:30,669 --> 00:15:37,000
1.5 1.6 I'd say realistically it's

247
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:40,810
probably 1.4 and I probably still got

248
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:44,220
the tiniest little bit to press so we'll

249
00:15:40,809 --> 00:15:50,439
go back and check yeah so it looks like

250
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:52,120
1.4 the tear is point 2 so we probably

251
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,710
still have that other little bit left in

252
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:58,090
there all right so here we've got the

253
00:15:53,710 --> 00:16:01,330
second press on the second 5 grams it

254
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:02,470
was it was hovering around 1.4 1.5 so

255
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:05,410
I'm guessing there's going to be another

256
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:10,920
point one or point two in here to top us

257
00:16:05,409 --> 00:16:10,919
off to that lovely 30 percent yield

258
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:25,299
all right a little bit they're

259
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:33,019
definitely worth dabbing all right and

260
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:34,970
that second press came out well it was

261
00:16:33,019 --> 00:16:37,850
at point two but now it's retail there

262
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:40,009
is the tear so point two is the proper

263
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:43,879
point two I think it's an actual

264
00:16:40,009 --> 00:16:45,588
accurate and yeah that combined with the

265
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:48,740
one point three two one point four we

266
00:16:45,589 --> 00:16:51,080
are at one point five again all right

267
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:53,060
guys welcome back we got a little bit of

268
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:57,410
Sun finally came out so that's kind of a

269
00:16:53,059 --> 00:17:00,528
bonus I whipped off two patties maybe a

270
00:16:57,409 --> 00:17:03,230
quick little ones just starting to

271
00:17:00,528 --> 00:17:09,109
butter a little bit they're pretty sweet

272
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:12,588
pretty sweet a little bit oh and this

273
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:17,419
one - this one - is doing do with the

274
00:17:12,588 --> 00:17:20,629
butter still very beautiful quite

275
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:22,390
looking forward to hitting that all

276
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:24,829
right

277
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:26,720
buttery buttery goodness so I figured we

278
00:17:24,828 --> 00:17:28,928
would do at least a rip of the where is

279
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,789
my bike now that you've seen the squish

280
00:17:28,929 --> 00:17:34,340
30% yield how incredible is that I'm

281
00:17:31,789 --> 00:17:36,289
telling you it blew my mind even though

282
00:17:34,339 --> 00:17:40,209
I had seen it once before it still blew

283
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:51,369
my mind let's get ourselves a little oh

284
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:56,919
yeah all right

285
00:17:51,369 --> 00:17:56,918
the mothership the egg

286
00:18:08,569 --> 00:18:17,648
always exciting to hit that first rip of

287
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:20,710
a new flavor but one you know so well

288
00:18:17,648 --> 00:18:23,268
gotta give props to maple butter

289
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:25,278
it's incredible quality gentlemen that

290
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:29,899
was some of the stickiest herb I have

291
00:18:25,278 --> 00:18:32,569
touched in a long time very sticky icky

292
00:18:29,898 --> 00:18:34,099
so the true sticky icky you put posters

293
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:36,138
up with that or no doubt if you can put

294
00:18:34,099 --> 00:18:38,949
posters up with that earth all right

295
00:18:36,138 --> 00:18:38,949
here we go

296
00:18:57,859 --> 00:19:05,528
the lemony flavor mixed with the terpene

297
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:05,528
alene it's just my favorite

298
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:32,490
oh yeah my god definitely down with

299
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:33,660
hitting many more of those now that it

300
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:34,400
buttered out actually I'll be able to

301
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:38,580
take some photos

302
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:40,890
earlier it was it looks so stable and

303
00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:42,929
tacky it's hard to take a picture of

304
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:47,400
just rosin in a medallion especially

305
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:52,710
with my lens going in too close it just

306
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:56,190
doesn't quite have the same effect it's

307
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:58,590
amazing how this DC cleaner picks up the

308
00:19:56,190 --> 00:20:01,559
resin out of the Banger I've got to say

309
00:19:58,589 --> 00:20:03,569
it every time I see it it impresses me I

310
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:08,399
was going for a little while without

311
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:13,139
without using it and fingers started

312
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:16,560
getting pretty jazzy this one I've hit

313
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:19,890
many many times so the best shape but

314
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:24,240
still doing okay will to clean some

315
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:28,040
spots off there all right so where is my

316
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:30,359
