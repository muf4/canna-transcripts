Wednesday with John

7
00:00:33,878 --> 00:00:39,039
B that was kind of fun it was pretty

8
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,280
cool we just went and dropped off uh

9
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:43,439
well you guys all saw what we just did

10
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:47,520
we just went to Air Canada cargo dropped

11
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:49,920
off uh five mothers the Betty Kush which

12
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,920
is going to secure John's genetics and

13
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,559
his

14
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:56,920
strain for himself and for anyone else

15
00:00:53,558 --> 00:00:59,439
who finds it as a beneficial strain uh

16
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,960
for pain management uh for anything

17
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:03,238
really but for pain management is what

18
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,719
John's using it for so I guess we've

19
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:07,359
gotten those plants out of our truck

20
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:09,599
yeah and now we're just sitting here at

21
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:11,799
the airport planes are in the background

22
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:14,039
kind of taken off taking off right now I

23
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:16,840
think that might be the Air Transat one

24
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:19,159
look it out there it is boom and here's

25
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:21,040
another one coming lining up so we're in

26
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:24,118
flight path Park this is just on the way

27
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,118
into Richmond from the airport we're

28
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:28,319
about 10 ft below sea level right now

29
00:01:26,118 --> 00:01:30,560
which is kind of trippy are we 10 ft

30
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:33,158
below sea level that's about 10 ft below

31
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,600
sea level yeah so I'm and the ocean's

32
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:36,799
right there so it's kind of trippy to

33
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:40,158
think we're a little bit below the level

34
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:42,920
of the ocean so anyway why don't we have

35
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,520
a sash John um I would love to do that

36
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,118

37
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:50,000

42
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:00,798

00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:11,159
time John I were here it was literally

303
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,519
the perfect restaurant

304
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:15,519
experience like a few friends that we

305
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,078
recognized I just wanted that Amsterdam

306
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:19,039
experience here just with their own

307
00:14:17,078 --> 00:14:20,958
style Amsterdam does not have this

308
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:22,679
experience yeah it's like I'm not

309
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:25,000
dissing on Amsterdam I love Amsterdam

310
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:26,719
but this is like uh you got your own

311
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,159
they're not covering this in the media

312
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,959
because it's Amsterdam like covering it

313
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:32,679
cuz it's new and it's different and it's

314
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:34,518
unlike anything that anyone's got going

315
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:37,719

316
