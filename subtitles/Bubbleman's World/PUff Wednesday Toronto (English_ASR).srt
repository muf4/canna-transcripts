11
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:43,359
do was start our session outside here at

00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:55,919
setup here I mean we we've puffed here

85
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,280
in the past like we've talked about yep

86
00:03:55,919 --> 00:04:00,559
um it's pretty much you know what this

87
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:03,120
is what we call Legal recreational

88
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,640
cannabis and medical yeah it's pretty

89
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,360
cool pretty cool pry cool we did make

90
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:07,759
sure that we're in the smoking section

91
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,439
yeah we go over to the farthest end of

92
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:11,280
where they smoke the cigarettes and uh

93
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:13,158
smoking section try not to bug anyone

94
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,640
just doing our own thing makes sense

95
00:04:13,158 --> 00:04:18,120
doing a little turp dip with the star

96
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:19,719
dog here oh yeah so here's a Dabber for

97
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:23,800
you Johnny B well thank you very much

98
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:25,280
sir we are taking um waterless bowls I I

99
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,400
like the dry hit because you get the

100
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:29,239
full flavor and at the airport I really

101
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:31,198
don't want to use water from the pudle I

102
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,079
hear you I'm going to to time it are you

103
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,800
yeah I think it's better when I time it

104
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:36,159
I think you have to time your Banger

105
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,680
this is really really important like

106
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,120
I've already wrecked mine we talked

107
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,240
about it you don't want to Chaz your

108
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,759
Banger don't want to Chaz your Banger

109
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:46,519
Chaz your Banger like I get excited

110
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,720
sometimes so timing it getting your

111
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:50,000
Q-tip

112
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:52,360
out really

113
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,038
important understanding that epic dab

114
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,800
that you need for the turine and the

115
00:04:54,038 --> 00:04:57,839
cleaning solution don't forget you need

116
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,439
the cap we need the cleaning solution

117
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:01,758
which we have oh it's in my bag where

118
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:04,519
did it get put do you remember the

119
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:06,280
cleaning solution I you said I put it

120
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:09,120
away it was in a bag was that in that

121
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:11,879
bag it said oh that was in this bag no

122
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,399
it's not in that bag so definitely we're

123
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:15,360
going to have a quick check real quick I

124
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:17,638
hope I have it because we can't hit off

125
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,479
this Banger without that it's my cleaner

126
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:22,840
uh-oh it's all my cleaning solution so

127
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:25,719
let's hope we find it you tell me when

128
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:28,918
to hit the start okay so that is good

129
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:32,080
hit start starting yep hit starting be

130
00:05:28,918 --> 00:05:34,839
great if this wasn't all there hold

131
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:37,318
that so the best part about this guys is

132
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:40,000
really is the timer giving it that

133
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:41,319
second to make sure everything is fine

134
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,120
taking a look at how everything's going

135
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:44,319
to be making sure he's got now you got

136
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,199

137
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:47,840

145

it don't move it around too much just

149
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:11,680
put it in and hold it um just because

150
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:12,960
you can [ __ ] up the base of the pipe

151
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,800
there it's got a little bit of a carving

152
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:18,399

00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:28,199
up back in the airport though should we

228
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:30,040

229
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,920
was is we get to and what are we going

230
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:34,719
to do you know what we're going on a

231
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:36,719
train yeah you guys ever thought we

232
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,440
would just be coming here and jumping

233
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,360
on Transit the ride that was picking us

234
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,720
up ended up at the wrong terminal this

235
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,600
is a huge airport and when I say the

236
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:48,680
wrong terminal I mean like he's several

237
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,720
kilomet away or like a mile away far

238
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:52,078
enough so we're actually going to get on

239
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,120
it's got a really cool little system

240
00:09:52,078 --> 00:09:55,879
here with the mono rail you can get on

241
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,360
this little train it runs every like 8

242
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:59,838
minutes or something and it's going to

243
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,879
take us there uh very quickly so like

244
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,880
trans that is what we're

245
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:08,090
[Music]

00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:07,879
idea actually gave me an idea John what

258
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:10,000

invite some people to meet us uh

260

the Bap Lounge I think that's a

262
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:19,159
fantastic idea as long as we get this

263
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,799
video up early enough tomorrow wow we

264
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:23,759

265
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:23,759
opportunity for us

614
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:51,798

615
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:53,440
you're good to go man just push that in

616
00:25:51,798 --> 00:25:55,278
there and hold it down and it'll all

617
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,120
fall off that nail and then we'll carb

618
00:25:55,278 --> 00:25:59,240
you

619
00:25:56,119 --> 00:26:00,918
up and yes it did do exactly what John

620
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:03,558
said exactly what it does when you carb

621
00:26:00,919 --> 00:26:05,480
a pipe generally which was interesting

622
00:26:03,558 --> 00:26:07,558
because when I carb the pipe hitting it

623
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:09,519
just with you know making it percolate

624
00:26:07,558 --> 00:26:12,079
without an actual rip it really felt

625
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:14,119
like there was no change whatsoever kind

626
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:15,599
of freaked me out a there wasn't there

627
00:26:14,119 --> 00:26:18,398
wasn't there was no change after to put

628
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:20,918
the carb on like you said right it's

629
00:26:18,398 --> 00:26:23,558
like just kind of went like right

630
00:26:20,919 --> 00:26:25,399
in wday it is a puff Wednesday and it's

631

experience is meeting good people and

814
00:34:59,079 --> 00:35:03,640
hey what more can you really ask for

815
00:35:01,838 --> 00:35:05,480
Johnny B's off to Mexico in the near

816
00:35:03,639 --> 00:35:08,000
future I'm off to Jamaica so I'm sure

817
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:10,320
you'll get some videos from both those

818
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,358
places although maybe not from Johnny B

819
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:15,000
he's on vacation he might not be making

820
00:35:12,358 --> 00:35:17,838
many videos while he's there you got to

821
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,119
make a video in

822
00:35:17,838 --> 00:35:23,719
though

823
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:26,280
please please Johnny there might be some

824
00:35:23,719 --> 00:35:29,639
adventures coming soon from an unknown

825
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:29,640
location that might happen

826
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:35,000
that's awesome little bit of the top

827
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:35,000
here needs to be

828
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:43,000
clean well you know keeping that thing

829
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:44,519
clean is important and it surely is

830
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,639
would you want to hit that I've already

831
00:35:44,519 --> 00:35:49,119
got this going

832
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:51,279
perfect you kind of have I've learned in

833
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:54,200
order to get this done properly this is

834
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:57,400
what you have to do guys this is really

835
00:35:54,199 --> 00:35:59,439
time it out you can't count you forget

836
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:03,039
so someone walks in something happens

837
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:05,119
but this you can't [ __ ] it up no unless

838
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:07,559
you overheat the nail compared to what

839
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:09,838
your timer is used to and then then then

840
00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:12,519
it's just like if if and doubt wait

841
00:36:09,838 --> 00:36:14,599
three more seconds the wor you can do is

842
00:36:12,519 --> 00:36:16,239
not wreck your Banger for me the simple

843
00:36:14,599 --> 00:36:18,318
test which is what you know people have

844
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:21,000
been using since people started doing

845
00:36:18,318 --> 00:36:22,639
this is the hand the wrist whatever

846
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,519
whatever it's a pretty good method my

847
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:26,838
wrist especially feels the sensitivity

848
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:29,318
of the heat very strong s when doesn't

849
00:36:26,838 --> 00:36:31,039
sizzle wrist anymore you like I don't

850
00:36:29,318 --> 00:36:32,838
think I'll hit this at 55 seconds I

851
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:36,039
think it'll still be too hot I'm going

852
00:36:32,838 --> 00:36:38,759
to go for like a minute 15 seconds or so

853
00:36:36,039 --> 00:36:39,838
see so it's always a different kind of

854
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,839
because we don't it depends on how much

855
00:36:39,838 --> 00:36:43,078
you torch if you torch the nail for long

856
00:36:41,838 --> 00:36:45,239
like lately I've been torching it just

857
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:47,240
cleaning off any remnants then you got

858
00:36:45,239 --> 00:36:50,039
to go more than 55 seconds I mean

859
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:54,799
especially this is a big banger

860
00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:59,279
so minute bit of um basically when and

861
00:36:54,800 --> 00:37:01,000
when not to hit your bag so we're really

862
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:03,720
learning that the low

863
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:06,639
dabs that's why they make these caps

864
00:37:03,719 --> 00:37:08,318
specifically for this reason you don't

865
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:09,799
need to Vapor that thing off like that

866
00:37:08,318 --> 00:37:13,400
you need to

867
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:15,440
pull you need to gather you need it to

868
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:17,760
you need to taste amazing you just kind

869
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:21,599
of need that [ __ ] to

870
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:25,240
work you heard it on puff Wednesday

871
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:28,280
sometimes you need to get that [ __ ] to

872
00:37:25,239 --> 00:37:30,559
