4

video for you guys to share I did this

5
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:31,959
one other time with a snowmobile video

6
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:35,159
that was about 2 years old and I

7
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:37,679
basically found it in my archives and

8
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:40,359
did a short introduction as well as a an

9
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:42,079
maybe even a middle a little talk in the

10
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:44,878
middle of between the two snowboard

11
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,079
videos or snowmobile videos and then

12
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,960
just finished it off and I thought I

13
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,198
would do the same thing today I found a

14
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:53,600
really great one of one of my greatest

15
00:00:50,198 --> 00:00:55,878
dirt bike uh ascents ever uh going as

16
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,239
high as I can up and it happened just up

17
00:00:55,878 --> 00:01:00,558
the road from me uh past a little north

18
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:02,038
of Squamish on the way up to whist

19
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:04,280
uh there's a little place called cat

20
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:07,239
Lake and Cat Lake takes you into the

21
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:09,799
garabaldi mountain range uh up through

22
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:11,599
Broome Ridge and if you Google brome

23
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:13,920
Ridge it's b r o

24
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:15,719
hm uh it's really beautiful there's a

25
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,240
cabin up there that the that the that

26
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:19,798
the snowmobile club has had for years

27
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:22,118
and you can rent it for a fairly uh

28
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:25,439
reasonable price and it's pretty awesome

29
00:01:22,118 --> 00:01:27,359

the whole thing with you guys here I

36

40
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:50,640
