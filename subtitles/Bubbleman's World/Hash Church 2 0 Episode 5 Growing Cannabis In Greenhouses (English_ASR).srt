Tom and I'm out of lower man I'm

44
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:37,419
originally out of San Diego but I've

45
00:02:35,379 --> 00:02:41,310
been up here in Vancouver Washington for

46
00:02:37,419 --> 00:02:44,169
the past 14 years we've got a 5 acre

47
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:46,930
farm we we bought an old nursery

48
00:02:44,169 --> 00:02:49,899
actually so it came with 500 foot

49
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:53,200
greenhouses little Quonset huts tiles

50
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:54,489
two wells two inch main lines up and

51
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:58,089
down the property is pretty much

52
00:02:54,489 --> 00:02:59,830
everything yeah I wanted and so we've

53
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:01,360
been here ever since and and kind of

54
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:04,810
doing our thing originally from San

55
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:07,690
Diego was part of the 215 push back in

56
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:09,849
the day our collective shelter from the

57
00:03:07,689 --> 00:03:12,009
storm in Hillcrest in San Diego got

58
00:03:09,849 --> 00:03:15,669
raided in 99 where I got arrested with

59
00:03:12,009 --> 00:03:18,849
Steve McWilliams for 448 plants and I

60
00:03:15,669 --> 00:03:21,699
kind of kicked me into the you know the

61
00:03:18,849 --> 00:03:23,199
advocate zone so like the worst thing

62
00:03:21,699 --> 00:03:25,060
could happen to you and then and then

63
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:26,939
you're not afraid anymore so we've been

64
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:30,670
kind of pushing through over the years

65
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:33,039
we worked I couldn't take a different

66
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:35,500
route so I I worked a lot with the media

67
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:39,969
back in the day here in Vancouver and in

68
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:41,620
the early days of 502 and even back in

69
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:43,900
the medical days we're doing the farmers

70
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:46,509
markets up here I just thought it was a

71
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:48,310
push to a better way to play it by you

72
00:03:46,509 --> 00:03:51,819
know being more accessible to them and

73
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:54,519
then trying to do my best to represent

74
00:03:51,819 --> 00:03:56,709
cannabis as well as possible that's kind

75
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:59,170
of all led up to we did some education

76
00:03:56,709 --> 00:04:01,680
over here over the years we worked with

77
00:03:59,169 --> 00:04:04,539
Washington state to legalize

78
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:07,030
concentrates because when they first

79
00:04:04,539 --> 00:04:10,389
came out with I 502 the legal system up

80
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:13,419
here they were gonna only concentrates

81
00:04:10,389 --> 00:04:15,759
we're going to be amenable and so I was

82
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:17,798
asked by como news out of Seattle to do

83
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:20,889
an open blast everybody thought I was

84
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:21,819
crazy we did it anyways and within two

85
00:04:20,889 --> 00:04:23,649
weeks base

86
00:04:21,819 --> 00:04:26,019
their message was if you don't regulate

87
00:04:23,649 --> 00:04:28,089
and don't tax it at the time here in

88
00:04:26,019 --> 00:04:29,680
Washington state was like every ten days

89
00:04:28,089 --> 00:04:31,449
to two weeks we're having another

90
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,819
explosion we're going if you don't

91
00:04:31,449 --> 00:04:35,589
regulate it and tax it these kids will

92
00:04:33,819 --> 00:04:38,050
blow themselves up it's a twenty to a

93
00:04:35,589 --> 00:04:39,339
hundred dollar fix and you're gonna have

94
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:40,750
a lot of problems on your hands so

95
00:04:39,339 --> 00:04:44,039
within two weeks they change the law

96
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:48,069
that kind of led into me being able

97
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:51,610
asked to work with the Department of

98
00:04:48,069 --> 00:04:54,099
Health and Human Services on the federal

99
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:56,980
level and we got to educate seven agents

100
00:04:54,100 --> 00:05:00,070
from the CDC on production of processing

101
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:02,560
in cannabis in 2015 when I first got on

102
00:05:00,069 --> 00:05:04,060
the phone with ten agents they they knew

103
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,530
nothing about cannabis they were getting

104
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:07,839
all their information from YouTube

105
00:05:05,529 --> 00:05:10,359
no offense to YouTube but I kind of

106
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:12,099
wasn't it unfair to come into a

107
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,230
valuation of our industry and not really

108
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:16,510
know what's going on so they agreed to

109
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:18,670
come to my farm that we were gonna take

110
00:05:16,509 --> 00:05:20,800
him on a tour they didn't like that idea

111
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:22,449
but they made my farmers secure location

112
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,730
where federal agents can learn touch and

113
00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:26,529
handle cannabis so I had him out here a

114
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:29,830
total of five days I had him out here

115
00:05:26,529 --> 00:05:31,809
and August for a couple days my plants

116
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:34,240
were about you know six feet tall and we

117
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:35,860
were thinning them out at the time and I

118
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,439
showed them all my practices that I've

119
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:40,360
been using as far as you know the

120
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:43,149
nutrients and everything else we were

121
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:45,610
doing with the plants and we gave him

122
00:05:43,149 --> 00:05:47,919
demos on hydrocarbons and I brought in

123
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:50,740
JD from scout farm to kind of tell him

124
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:52,120
about concentrates and Dana from goat

125
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:53,889
labs to kind of give him the lab

126
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:56,050
spectrum and we bought it you know we

127
00:05:53,889 --> 00:05:58,539
did a hand trimming machine trimming and

128
00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:01,030
then that was kind of the precursor to

129
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:06,010
when they came out for the actual health

130
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:08,319
hazard evaluation in October of 2015

131
00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:10,629
that was like the glory year I mean it

132
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,490
was like the best year ever and I was

133
00:06:10,629 --> 00:06:15,189
lucky that we didn't get earlier rains

134
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:17,590
and we didn't have any kind of issues

135
00:06:15,189 --> 00:06:19,300
going at the time so we had him out

136
00:06:17,589 --> 00:06:22,509
there three for three days and they were

137
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:24,939
there to collect scientific data for a

138
00:06:22,509 --> 00:06:26,980
workplace health and safety so they

139
00:06:24,939 --> 00:06:28,660
hooked us up with sniffers one that

140
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:31,020
collected mold ones that collect dust

141
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:33,120
particles and then they have stem

142
00:06:31,019 --> 00:06:35,579
apparatuses around the property in the

143
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,459
greenhouses out in the open air and in

144
00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:40,769
our trimming and drying room they

145
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:45,478
gathered all the data they went back and

146
00:06:40,769 --> 00:06:49,079
and it was published in April of 2017

147
00:06:45,478 --> 00:06:51,839
and in August of 2017 I got my own web

148
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:55,918
page on the CDC gov web page dedicated

149
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:57,299
to the scientific study OSHA is using

150
00:06:55,918 --> 00:06:59,339
them on a national level to create

151
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:01,829
workplace Elkin safety standards for the

152
00:06:59,339 --> 00:07:04,109
industry Cal OSHA is using the same

153
00:07:01,829 --> 00:07:08,370
report and I believe Washington State's

154
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:12,930
use that also so now that the reports

155
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:16,348
out the latest thing is that my farm is

156
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:18,000
referred to as an organic cannabis bar

157
00:07:16,348 --> 00:07:20,399
search studies that are being done on

158
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:25,889
the federal level so that's kind of what

159
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:30,779
I've been up to last few years yeah

160
00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:34,889
that's a lot of thanks so much that's

161
00:07:30,779 --> 00:07:37,168
really interesting sounds like so many

162
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:38,389
ways for us to count the good

163
00:07:37,168 --> 00:07:41,279
information

164
00:07:38,389 --> 00:07:44,120
well it takes it really takes all of us

165
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:47,129

00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,990
know YouTube's not always the best

203
00:09:26,309 --> 00:09:29,969
source for information but we're trying

204
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:32,850
to we're trying to change that every day

205
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:34,889
with at least our little slice and it's

206
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:37,200
because of people like all of the people

207
00:09:34,889 --> 00:09:38,730

208
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,040
come and share their time with us that

209
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:43,649

information out so I do thank all of you

277
00:12:53,678 --> 00:12:59,619

281
00:13:03,339 --> 00:13:07,839
the game right there man and it really

282
00:13:05,109 --> 00:13:09,850
made hash making accessible to the

283
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:12,549
people and really started the whole saw

284
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:14,619
solvent less movement I believe so Big

285
00:13:12,548 --> 00:13:18,039
Ups brother and Big Ups on your light

286
00:13:14,619 --> 00:13:20,678
DEP hat my name is Jonathan I founded

287
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:24,248
forever flowering in 2006 I've been

288
00:13:20,678 --> 00:13:26,198
working with Eric since 2007 we've

289
00:13:24,249 --> 00:13:28,629
really been working hard around the

290
00:13:26,198 --> 00:13:31,688
clock year-round to in the beginning

291
00:13:28,629 --> 00:13:34,028
educate people as to why you wanted to

292
00:13:31,688 --> 00:13:36,188
block the light out of greenhouses

293
00:13:34,028 --> 00:13:37,899
people would always laugh at us like why

294
00:13:36,188 --> 00:13:38,498
are you trying to block the light out of

295
00:13:37,899 --> 00:13:41,198
greenhouses

296
00:13:38,499 --> 00:13:44,100
and so you know for the first many years

297
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:47,498
it was a lot of a lot of Education and

298
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:50,079
as we see the industry moving forward

299
00:13:47,499 --> 00:13:53,409
and we're seeing the the vast majority

300
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:55,628
of licenses going especially in states

301
00:13:53,409 --> 00:13:58,178
outside of California going towards

302
00:13:55,629 --> 00:14:00,220
indoor cultivation we're really seeing

303
00:13:58,178 --> 00:14:01,688
this massive carbon footprint that's

304
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:04,239
being created and you can see the

305
00:14:01,688 --> 00:14:07,328
headlines in so many places that they're

306
00:14:04,239 --> 00:14:11,048
saying cannabis is this massive energy

307
00:14:07,328 --> 00:14:14,528
consuming industry and it's really not

308
00:14:11,048 --> 00:14:16,629
necessary true it is today but it's

309
00:14:14,528 --> 00:14:30,369
totally not necessary and so when you

310
00:14:16,629 --> 00:14:32,980
can really dial in a greenhouse hemp guy

311
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:36,189
who came on has to mute that person has

312
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:37,720
to mute so anyway when you design a

313
00:14:36,188 --> 00:14:40,808
greenhouse with the proper environment

314
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:43,989
you're able to get you know top quality

315
00:14:40,808 --> 00:14:46,028
flowers and and still have the

316
00:14:43,989 --> 00:14:48,149
efficiency of growing sun-grown and and

317
00:14:46,028 --> 00:14:51,009
as we're seeing in most regulated states

318
00:14:48,149 --> 00:14:53,078
full Sun grown is really all going to

319
00:14:51,009 --> 00:14:54,699
extracts they're really oil fields at

320
00:14:53,078 --> 00:14:58,058
this point and what we're really seeing

321
00:14:54,698 --> 00:15:00,669
in the dispensaries are indoor or high

322
00:14:58,058 --> 00:15:04,799
grade light depth

323
00:15:00,669 --> 00:15:08,079
greenhouse groaning and unfortunately

324
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:10,199
that's that's my intro before I ramble

325
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:17,560
off too much just had a cup of coffee so

326
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:19,750
let's left you guys guy get me started

327
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:21,579
oh no you're good you're good we're

387
00:18:51,859 --> 00:18:56,269
be a neat thing to hear a couple of

388
00:18:53,538 --> 00:18:58,529

howdy howdy howdy everybody in hash

393
00:19:06,289 --> 00:19:13,309
Church yeah my experience with green

394
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:16,580
houses was I built my own green house

395
00:19:13,309 --> 00:19:19,789
about 40 years ago and then I moved to

396
00:19:16,579 --> 00:19:22,339
the Netherlands where I ran many many

397
00:19:19,789 --> 00:19:25,009
many professional green houses with

398
00:19:22,339 --> 00:19:29,539
computerized darkening computerized

399
00:19:25,009 --> 00:19:34,359
watering and and I my favorite way to

400
00:19:29,539 --> 00:19:34,359
grow is greenhouses although there's

401
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:43,279
but IIIi I've been there I've seen most

402
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:46,600
of the changes we were one of the very

403
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:50,149
first in the world to use darkening for

404
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:51,980
to mature cannabis flowers in the when

405
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:54,830
we were in the northern environment in

406
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:58,099
the greenhouse and if anybody has any

407
00:19:54,829 --> 00:20:01,279
questions I'll be happy to step up to

408
00:19:58,099 --> 00:20:02,929
the box but except for that I am what I

409
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:13,160
am and I think pretty much everybody

410
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:15,130
knows me guys well yes I mean basically

411
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:18,380
you know we're here to talk about

412
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:20,360
greenhouses and everybody on the panel

413
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:22,250
here is using greenhouses in some

414
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:24,349
capacity whether it's you know whether

415
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:27,259
they're working with us or not

416
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:30,319
everybody's got a unique story and to

417
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:31,970
themselves and so mica I was just gonna

418
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:33,649
kick it off with you since in case you

419
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:35,660
have to bounce early at least we can get

420
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:38,300
some of the information from leaf

421
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:40,009
organics you know I'm I'm you know big

422
00:20:38,299 --> 00:20:41,960
fan of your products as well just

423
00:20:40,009 --> 00:20:46,309
because everything you have is so cool

424
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:48,950
and Sun grown and I use the pet CBDs you

425
00:20:46,309 --> 00:20:51,799
know for my old dogs and even the CBD

426
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:53,299
shampoo and so you know not going into

427
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:55,460
the products as much I'm just curious

428
00:20:53,299 --> 00:20:57,710
for your story is you know a grower in

429
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:59,630
Southern and Northern California have

430
00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:01,519
the greenhouses or what you know what

431
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:03,230
achievements or breakthroughs have you

432
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:08,379
had in the greenhouse sector in the last

433
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:11,329
couple of years yeah I think for me that

434
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:13,460
we're where the you know greenhouses

435
00:21:11,329 --> 00:21:16,119
come into play and especially light

436
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:19,160
deprivation greenhouses come into play

437
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:21,319
and that's like new era of regulation

438
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:24,680
and taxes and having to like really

439
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:26,329
focus on your cost of goods that's where

440
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:29,150
I see you know not only do I think

441
00:21:26,329 --> 00:21:31,189
plants grow better in greenhouses but

442
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:37,340
for us it's a way for us to get our

443
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:39,320
costumers yeah we're able you know

444
00:21:37,339 --> 00:21:40,789
constantly be harvesting over and over

445
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:44,720
and over again versus just getting one

446
00:21:40,789 --> 00:21:46,250
two arrests a year and you know and then

447
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,079
we're you know seeing a big difference

448
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:49,769
between what we're getting an output in

449
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:51,689
Southern California versus

450
00:21:49,769 --> 00:21:56,069
Northern California just due to weather

451
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:58,140
and you know most of the places in

452
00:21:56,069 --> 00:22:00,599
envelope - you know we're all out the

453
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:02,250
grid and there's no power or nothin like

454
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:05,189
that so it's all ran off solar systems

455
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:07,289
which is awesome and or we're pullin

456
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:10,110
tarps you know which is still totally

457
00:22:07,289 --> 00:22:11,039
good and works but I think if that I

458
00:22:10,109 --> 00:22:14,039
don't know if that answers your question

459
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:15,899
I'd like for us I think it's a way for

460
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:18,539
us to constantly be getting fresh

461
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:20,340
product in the rotation and not be

462
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:24,450
sitting on just a bunch of you know

463
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:25,859
older inventory and and helps us get our

464
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:30,960
cost of goods down which is super

465
00:22:25,859 --> 00:22:33,000
important well I mean that's the name of

466
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,200
the game these days keeping the cost of

467
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,779
goods down because there's so many

468
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:39,509
things I mean now with regulation eight

469
00:22:36,779 --> 00:22:42,000
taxes have kicked in so I'm sure you

470
00:22:39,509 --> 00:22:43,859
medically medical legal for a while now

471
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,829
the state taxes have kicked in and so

472
00:22:43,859 --> 00:22:48,949
that's got to be a little bit of a new I

473
00:22:46,829 --> 00:22:50,308
guess a new challenge for you to address

474
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:52,140
yeah

475
00:22:50,308 --> 00:22:53,639
every day it's a we always talk about it

476
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:55,800
at the office it's like a Rubik's Cube

477
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:57,030
you know trying to figure out what

478
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:59,579
changes you're gonna have to deal with

479
00:22:57,029 --> 00:23:00,629
next and right I think the laws aren't

480
00:22:59,579 --> 00:23:04,619
even really set yet and they're gonna

481
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:06,690
change again so and so how do you feel

482
00:23:04,619 --> 00:23:09,899
about I mean you guys run fairly

483
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:11,640
moderate size greenhouses or you can are

484
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:13,080
you guys working on any big projects or

485
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:17,640
anything coming up are you guys gonna

486
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:19,289
stay kind of the the you know mid-sized

487
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:21,150
greenhouses that you've been using now

488
00:23:19,289 --> 00:23:22,889
and pulling tarps or where we where's

489
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:24,870
the future ahead now with trying to keep

490
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:27,900
cost of production down and state taxes

491
00:23:24,869 --> 00:23:31,319
kicking in you know that's a good

492
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:32,820
question I think for now we have a bit a

493
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:34,439
bit of both you know as you know we have

494
00:23:32,819 --> 00:23:35,849
a we have a synth rubber flower and

495
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:38,250
greenhouses and then we have some that

496
00:23:35,849 --> 00:23:40,799
we're blowing tarps on and a lot of that

497
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:43,259
comes down to what city or county you're

498
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:46,079
in and has a lot to do with what your

499
00:23:43,259 --> 00:23:47,220
local taxes are so we do have a bigger

500
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:50,220
project that we're working on in

501
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:53,009
Riverside County which we're going to be

502
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:55,620
doing a bunch of it's it'll be a bigger

503
00:23:53,009 --> 00:23:59,150
project and it'll be a you know a fully

504
00:23:55,619 --> 00:24:00,979
automated greenhouse setup I personally

505
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:03,860
like the idea

506
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:05,539
keeping greenhouses in a smaller

507
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:08,149
environment versus like this massive

508
00:24:05,539 --> 00:24:11,029
Costco style thing I think it's a lot

509
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:13,130
easier to mitigate problems with all

510
00:24:11,029 --> 00:24:15,289
kinds of stuff pests and not that you

511
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:17,030
don't need these massive HVAC systems

512
00:24:15,289 --> 00:24:19,789
and sort of turn the thing into a

513
00:24:17,029 --> 00:24:23,329
gigantic into a room which I see a lot

514
00:24:19,789 --> 00:24:26,629
of people doing and so yeah I mean I

515
00:24:23,329 --> 00:24:28,009
think in the future we're definitely

516
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:30,100
leaning towards building a couple a

517
00:24:28,009 --> 00:24:31,910
couple of these bigger facilities but

518
00:24:30,099 --> 00:24:33,798
there's still something to be said about

519
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:37,220
quality product being grown in a small

520
00:24:33,798 --> 00:24:39,079
environment you know it's it's any time

521
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:41,150
we've ever scaled you know like we did

522
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:43,939
in the last couple years it's it's hard

523
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:45,320
to keep up and make sure that you're

524
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:47,919
putting out the same quality product

525
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:50,569
every single time so it's a bit of both

526
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:52,610
key that's that's always a tough thing

527
00:24:50,569 --> 00:24:54,200
and about consistency you know a lot of

528
00:24:52,609 --> 00:24:55,969
the flour these days I guess in

529
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:58,490
California in some places would end up

530
00:24:55,970 --> 00:25:00,140
going to distillates and oils and

531
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:02,058
extracts which is a good thing in some

532
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:05,690
ways but I'm kind of wondering if we're

533
00:25:02,058 --> 00:25:07,759
gonna see flowers you know on the

534
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:10,190
shelves top shelf flowers people want to

535
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:12,019
buy some flowers to go camping with to

536
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:13,730
roll a joint or do whatever I mean I

537
00:25:12,019 --> 00:25:16,069
know that there's a lot of mids going

538
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:18,079
down but you know as California gonna be

539
00:25:16,069 --> 00:25:21,649
hit with the shortage kind of like

540
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:23,298
Nevada was just in the top shelf flower

541
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:25,250
category I mean I think all the other

542
00:25:23,298 --> 00:25:26,960
things are gonna fall into place but I

543
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:28,548
just worry about that good doobie

544
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,950
material and I was reading about some of

545
00:25:28,548 --> 00:25:32,089
the other day saying something about

546
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:34,190
everybody's just gonna get used to mids

547
00:25:32,089 --> 00:25:36,139
and not really remember what top shelf

548
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:39,350
looks like I was like wait a minute I

549
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:41,150
don't know about that but I know that

550
00:25:39,349 --> 00:25:43,490
you guys are doing good in the top shelf

551
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:46,730
category but the gross sisters just

552
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:48,259
joined us and Sherman wants you saying

553
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:56,690

hi Micah we party in Vegas let em take

562
00:26:19,769 --> 00:26:28,410

563
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:32,059
my telling you more is it still my stage

564
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:42,830
I might just introducing myself oh well

565
00:26:32,059 --> 00:26:42,829
the different and is that your brand I

566
00:26:43,549 --> 00:26:47,879
think you're muted yeah I had to mute

567
00:26:46,259 --> 00:26:54,210
her cuz you were echoing sorry about

568
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:57,660
that okay we're back um yes those are my

569
00:26:54,210 --> 00:27:00,090
brands the farm itself is blessed Coast

570
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:02,400
farms and gross sisters media production

571
00:27:00,089 --> 00:27:05,089
is a little bit different we're a little

572
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:08,250
bit more of the education side and

573
00:27:05,089 --> 00:27:11,269
initially it started because my sister

574
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:14,220
my actual sister Sloane Reed and I

575
00:27:11,269 --> 00:27:18,389
wanted to we didn't have money to market

576
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:19,829
our farm and so we decided to set a

577
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:24,240
guerilla marketing style of

578
00:27:19,829 --> 00:27:26,220
instructional videos and yeah they kind

579
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,380
of took off and so this year it's our

580
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:31,799
second year doing the gross sisters and

581
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:33,360
we've adopted five new sisters four new

582
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:35,490
sisters and some behind-the-scenes

583
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:37,740
sisters and so we're really able to

584
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:40,289
branch out from the farm and cultivate

585
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:52,589
cannabis and all its new facets and so

586
00:27:40,289 --> 00:28:01,230
yeah it's all yeah yeah again you're

587
00:27:52,589 --> 00:28:03,029
good mic muted will echo through someone

588
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:04,980
else's camera so just try to mute when

589
00:28:03,029 --> 00:28:08,309
you don't talk and get ready to unmute

590
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:12,269
when you want to talk and welcome thanks

591
00:28:08,309 --> 00:28:15,000
thanks for having me yeah that's awesome

592
00:28:12,269 --> 00:28:17,460
well I met I met you at the golden tarp

593
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:20,250
Awards and that's where you're a host

594
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:22,950
for the live stream and so that was a

595
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:24,869
pretty cool event too and you guys did a

596
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:27,390
really good job of hosting and

597
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:29,219
live-streaming that whole thing

598
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:31,710
yeah what's it like to be the first

599
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:36,779
permitted farm in Humboldt County by the

600
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:41,340
way stressful a lot

601
00:28:36,779 --> 00:28:42,950
we were the guinea pigs and it felt like

602
00:28:41,339 --> 00:28:46,769
our heads were on the chopping block

603
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:49,319
to be completely honest but you know on

604
00:28:46,769 --> 00:28:51,389
the flip side of that it was it's been

605
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:52,950
amazing it's been wonderful I mean what

606
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:58,530
a blessing too I'm a second-generation

607
00:28:52,950 --> 00:29:01,049
farmer and to be able to carry the torch

608
00:28:58,529 --> 00:29:02,670
for my father who lived in the hills for

609
00:29:01,049 --> 00:29:04,950
years and years and years you know and

610
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:06,900
Here I am with the first fermented farm

611
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:11,549
it's an honor it's a blessing

612
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:14,720
hence blessed Coast but yeah it's been

613
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:17,849
crazy we've gotten some really beautiful

614
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:21,000
recognition for our farming techniques

615
00:29:17,849 --> 00:29:23,639
due to being the first so we like to

616
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,369
tell people that we filled out the

617
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:29,310
application as simply as possible simple

618
00:29:26,369 --> 00:29:31,169
farming methods simply organic and so

619
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:35,609
that's why we think we got it

620
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:38,730
got lucky well that's really cool I

621
00:29:35,609 --> 00:29:42,779
appreciate you coming on and we'll talk

622
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:44,730
a little bit more JD are you still over

623
00:29:42,779 --> 00:29:50,579
there up I see JD was walking around a

624
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:52,410
little bit we can yeah JD you know JD

625
00:29:50,579 --> 00:29:54,059
lives in Grass Valley it's funny I don't

626
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:56,519
even really know JD I'm in Grass Valley

627
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:58,169
too and I happen to see him our kids go

628
00:29:56,519 --> 00:30:00,869
to the same school and then I was in an

629
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:02,789
event and I saw he won an award last

630
00:30:00,869 --> 00:30:04,769
year and even this year I'm like wait a

631
00:30:02,789 --> 00:30:06,389
minute I'm at cannabis events and this

632
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:08,160
guy's winning all these cups and then

633
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:09,690
I'm dropping my kids off at school and

634
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:12,210
there he is in the parking lot walking

635
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:14,549
his kids and it's like this whoa like

636
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:16,110
right on so I you know wanted to meet

637
00:30:14,549 --> 00:30:19,200
him over the course of time and so we

638
00:30:16,109 --> 00:30:21,149
started linking up slowly and so I

639
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,970
thought JD has a good story or

640
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:26,280
interesting you know background with you

641
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:28,740
know the ability to you know enter these

642
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:30,539
events and win them and we were just you

643
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:32,549
know I'm curious on the style of growing

644
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:35,129
you're using are you a high tech grower

645
00:30:32,549 --> 00:30:37,200
you know is it low tech what's the

646
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:40,040
secret to some of your success without

647
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,039
giving everything away

648
00:30:40,109 --> 00:30:46,269
let's see that's a good question um I I

649
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:48,930
just love it you know we all love it so

650
00:30:46,269 --> 00:30:52,019
much like our team works really hard

651
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:56,019
maybe we put in a little too much work

652
00:30:52,019 --> 00:31:00,269
sometimes that makes sense we could

653
00:30:56,019 --> 00:31:02,410
probably not be as perfection driven but

654
00:31:00,269 --> 00:31:04,750
we take really good care of them you

655
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:09,519
know it's compost tea and it's organic

656
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:11,710
top dressings it's funny I feel like the

657
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:13,569
you know the plant really reflects what

658
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:15,670
you're putting into it so if everybody's

659
00:31:13,569 --> 00:31:18,629
in a clear space and working together

660
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:22,600
then the seems like the round to really

661
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:24,970
show that we had to really hide terpene

662
00:31:22,599 --> 00:31:26,980
levels the last couple of rounds and I

663
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:28,509
don't know maybe it was because the

664
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:29,980
industry's changing and I was stressed

665
00:31:28,509 --> 00:31:32,609
out and so the plant was stressed out

666
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:35,200
and those terpenes are its natural

667
00:31:32,609 --> 00:31:36,639
defense mechanism you know it's like as

668
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,400
the point gets more stressed it seems

669
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:41,980
like it pushes out more medicine I'm not

670
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:43,960
exactly sure we've just like I said

671
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:45,549
moving moving up the coast was great

672
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:47,110
growing in Lake County was great

673
00:31:45,549 --> 00:31:49,869
moving into the Sierra Foothills was

674
00:31:47,109 --> 00:31:51,399
absolutely amazing losing the coastal

675
00:31:49,869 --> 00:31:53,889
influence and really having these hot

676
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:56,860
days seems to really trigger the plants

677
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:59,110
and swelling up at the right time and

678
00:31:56,859 --> 00:32:03,369
just appreciating where we give it to

679
00:31:59,109 --> 00:32:06,459
them I'll grow and everything from low

680
00:32:03,369 --> 00:32:09,069
end car parts cart you know Costco card

681
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:13,210
canopies with grow we've all the way to

682
00:32:09,069 --> 00:32:16,750
you know 2500 square foot on a depths

683
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:19,690
that are completely dialed in we've won

684
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:20,740
awards from both both directions so it's

685
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:22,299
like I haven't really been held at

686
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:24,329
Neyland got exactly what works it just

687
00:32:22,299 --> 00:32:27,129
seems to be working across the board and

688
00:32:24,329 --> 00:32:28,869
probably due to the level of love that

689
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:32,020
my team puts in and this climber that we

690
00:32:28,869 --> 00:32:33,639
have how long have you lived in the

691
00:32:32,019 --> 00:32:35,950
Grass Valley area you said you started

692
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:38,500
out maybe the Coast Lake County how long

693
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:41,950
have you been over here now to the

694
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:44,410
foothills see I was in a Lake County in

695
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:46,500
2001 and then I made it here probably

696
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:50,640
about five years ago

697
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:52,660
Smart's Ville Browns Valley or similan

698
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,759
yeah I've been kind of all over the

699
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:55,950
place

700
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:57,299
yeah but the last five years I've really

701
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:59,580
been all to dialing in and it's awesome

702
00:32:57,299 --> 00:33:02,190
this is where my family wanted to land

703
00:32:59,579 --> 00:33:05,789
we was about as close to the snow is

704
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:07,440
that could be because the rest of them

705
00:33:05,789 --> 00:33:09,420
don't like the cold and so I didn't got

706
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:12,120
being a great mix so it's like close to

707
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:14,190
Tahoe and the winter got below the snow

708
00:33:12,119 --> 00:33:16,589
line in something you know the rest of

709
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:18,509
the season and it just really makes our

710
00:33:16,589 --> 00:33:21,619
job easy so everything that we put it

711
00:33:18,509 --> 00:33:23,789
here seems to just go so much farther

712
00:33:21,619 --> 00:33:25,649
yeah it's almost like you could start

713
00:33:23,789 --> 00:33:31,470
pulling tarps today I mean this weather

714
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:34,050
has been unreal it's like at night we're

715
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:37,559
still like in the low 50s and so yeah

716
00:33:34,049 --> 00:33:40,049
that's that's some good grown weather do

717
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:42,419
you use a passive style greenhouse or a

718
00:33:40,049 --> 00:33:44,069
sealed greenhouse with venom mechanical

719
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:46,830
ventilation what's your style of

720
00:33:44,069 --> 00:33:48,539
greenhouse operation unlike the canopies

721
00:33:46,829 --> 00:33:51,720
if the ones we built ourselves you know

722
00:33:48,539 --> 00:33:54,839
they're open all the way around I have

723
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:56,910
about a knee-high you know knee-high to

724
00:33:54,839 --> 00:33:59,309
the ground it's just wide open all the

725
00:33:56,910 --> 00:34:02,279
way around the greenhouse I have one end

726
00:33:59,309 --> 00:34:03,629
of the canopy would be a seal I'm not

727
00:34:02,279 --> 00:34:05,639
feeling but pulled down probably about

728
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:07,860
3/4 of the way and then the other end

729
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:09,869
wide open and that kind of creates like

730
00:34:07,859 --> 00:34:11,519
a funnel and it like forces air from the

731
00:34:09,869 --> 00:34:13,259
sides and the back and flushes it out

732
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:17,639
that open end of the hoop automatically

733
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:19,830
without using fans or anything my auto

734
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:22,170
death is definitely like you know closed

735
00:34:19,829 --> 00:34:23,779
up I don't know how sealed it is but

736
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:26,490
it's definitely closed up and with

737
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:27,810
thermostats and can flush that air out

738
00:34:26,489 --> 00:34:32,819
really fast when they hit the right

739
00:34:27,809 --> 00:34:35,429
temperature okay cool so I mean do you

740
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:37,140
when you enter Awards so you enter them

741
00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:38,909
out of any greenhouse it doesn't really

742
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:40,529
matter it's like you know you don't have

743
00:34:38,909 --> 00:34:42,599
one greenhouse that's better for the

744
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:45,200
award maker than the other or Terp maker

745
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:45,199
let's say

746
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:51,088
unmute I was trying to figure it out you

747
00:34:49,648 --> 00:34:54,509
know it's trying to figure out like

748
00:34:51,088 --> 00:34:56,489
exactly what was the recipe and the

749
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:59,069
first one we won we got a second-place

750
00:34:56,489 --> 00:35:01,919
hybrid and him Khan and that was with

751
00:34:59,068 --> 00:35:05,219
harley soo CBD strain going up against

752
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:06,990
Indore and it ended up winning and

753
00:35:05,219 --> 00:35:10,909
that's just out of a Costco car port

754
00:35:06,989 --> 00:35:13,048
with no fans no supplemental lighting

755
00:35:10,909 --> 00:35:14,278
and it just did great it's just like

756
00:35:13,048 --> 00:35:15,960
kind of look around like you know you

757
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:18,179
can tell the plant that really does it

758
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:22,170
you can tell the round you know when the

759
00:35:18,179 --> 00:35:25,588
round is just going off and that one was

760
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:26,818
really good the golden tarp winners and

761
00:35:25,588 --> 00:35:29,429
then woke up winners have been out of

762
00:35:26,818 --> 00:35:33,239
the auto death probably at about I think

763
00:35:29,429 --> 00:35:35,368
it's like an 800 foot elevation that

764
00:35:33,239 --> 00:35:36,868
one's pushing really high profiles

765
00:35:35,369 --> 00:35:38,430
almost everything that came out of there

766
00:35:36,869 --> 00:35:41,369
that round was like over five percent

767
00:35:38,429 --> 00:35:42,989
terpenes the plants were a little more

768
00:35:41,369 --> 00:35:44,579
stressed I didn't think it was gonna be

769
00:35:42,989 --> 00:35:47,598
that good of a round but when it came to

770
00:35:44,579 --> 00:35:50,460
test results they were just off the hook

771
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:52,470
it's funny how that that goes sometimes

772
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:54,778
you know like stress and plants out and

773
00:35:52,469 --> 00:35:57,088
things like that can be stressful for

774
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:58,619
the grower as well but then you end up

775
00:35:57,088 --> 00:36:00,538
you know trimming it up and maybe you

776
00:35:58,619 --> 00:36:03,960
can get in those lab results and voila

777
00:36:00,539 --> 00:36:06,259
you got something special it's hard

778
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:09,929
always kind of hard to tell you know

779
00:36:06,259 --> 00:36:11,909
Jason are you back are you able to jump

780
00:36:09,929 --> 00:36:18,868
on and introduce yourself now sorry we

781
00:36:11,909 --> 00:36:24,719
kind of glazed over for a second yeah

782
00:36:18,869 --> 00:36:29,548
that's that network um so um my name is

783
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:31,379
Jason hello everybody I am a I'm a

784
00:36:29,548 --> 00:36:33,630
recreational driller up here in

785
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:39,000
Washington State started in medical and

786
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:42,358
long before that I'd say what got me

787
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:44,639
into greenhouse growing was just kind of

788
00:36:42,358 --> 00:36:48,420
watching the prices just ratcheted down

789
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:50,578
and kind of really feeling like I needed

790
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:52,920
to look into a different growing method

791
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:58,680
and so kind of up the tail in the

792
00:36:52,920 --> 00:37:00,539
medical I am I started in with talking

793
00:36:58,679 --> 00:37:04,528
to Eric and getting together

794
00:37:00,539 --> 00:37:07,650
plans to build a greenhouse and and then

795
00:37:04,528 --> 00:37:10,978
you know as as it kind of progressed

796
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:14,400
getting license really seeing everything

797
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:16,649
just changed drastically it kind of

798
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:19,469
occurred to me that you know we grew

799
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:23,579
indoors to hide from the cops and so now

800
00:37:19,469 --> 00:37:27,208
in this regulated market and an illegal

801
00:37:23,579 --> 00:37:30,749
market in Washington it's like I just

802
00:37:27,208 --> 00:37:32,788
don't get it why why everybody isn't

803
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:34,558
going this direction and I think the

804
00:37:32,789 --> 00:37:37,249
future really is like that greenhouse

805
00:37:34,559 --> 00:37:39,630
and it really is going that direction

806
00:37:37,248 --> 00:37:41,509
but you know coming from an indoor

807
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:43,890
grower backed up for so many years I

808
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:47,039
really just took everything that I need

809
00:37:43,889 --> 00:37:50,598
from indoor grilling and applied it in

810
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:54,028
the greenhouse and I think my quality

811
00:37:50,599 --> 00:37:56,099
tariff levels I mean everything is just

812
00:37:54,028 --> 00:37:58,289
as good if not better you know a lot of

813
00:37:56,099 --> 00:38:00,660
cases not to mention a much more

814
00:37:58,289 --> 00:38:04,049
enjoyable work environment being under

815
00:38:00,659 --> 00:38:09,118
the Sun you know it's it's chock-full of

816
00:38:04,048 --> 00:38:12,418
Divya's and fans and dehumidifiers yeah

817
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:17,459
pretty wet weather up here but I go

818
00:38:12,418 --> 00:38:19,978
year-round and I I love growing in

819
00:38:17,458 --> 00:38:22,438
greenhouses I've got I've got one of her

820
00:38:19,978 --> 00:38:25,198
flowerings almost a thousand square foot

821
00:38:22,438 --> 00:38:28,649
and then I've got a few hoop houses that

822
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:33,239
I run just as sort of old-school polo

823
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:34,729
type during the season and so far so

824
00:38:33,239 --> 00:38:37,108
good

825
00:38:34,728 --> 00:38:39,629
that's awesome I went to your place a

826
00:38:37,108 --> 00:38:41,909
couple years ago and you up on the

827
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:43,769
islands of Washington and one of the

828
00:38:41,909 --> 00:38:46,650
incredible things about your particular

829
00:38:43,768 --> 00:38:48,629
property is that there's bald eagles

830
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:51,809
flying everywhere around the greenhouses

831
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:54,568
and like you know it's just this magical

832
00:38:51,809 --> 00:38:56,640
space and I mean whether you're pulling

833
00:38:54,568 --> 00:38:59,099
tarps or an automated greenhouse or

834
00:38:56,639 --> 00:39:02,278
whatever I can't imagine that being a

835
00:38:59,099 --> 00:39:05,099
tough place to live and grow I mean I

836
00:39:02,278 --> 00:39:07,318
was you know mesmerized by the place

837
00:39:05,099 --> 00:39:09,689
myself and look forward to coming back

838
00:39:07,318 --> 00:39:12,389
and visiting again sometime but you know

839
00:39:09,688 --> 00:39:14,369
how we met - is that all your videos on

840
00:39:12,389 --> 00:39:17,579
Instagram was you going through a 50

841
00:39:14,369 --> 00:39:19,889
thousand square foot indoor facility on

842
00:39:17,579 --> 00:39:21,509
a skateboard going from room to room to

843
00:39:19,889 --> 00:39:23,489
room you know and it was the build-out

844
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:26,940
it was the build-out of this big massive

845
00:39:23,489 --> 00:39:29,279
indoor facility and basically you one

846
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:31,349
day just walked away and you know about

847
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:33,240
the eight or thousand square foot

848
00:39:31,349 --> 00:39:36,869
greenhouse to kind of test this all out

849
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:39,119
and you know I mean I think you've

850
00:39:36,869 --> 00:39:40,949
really become one of the bigger Sun

851
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:42,929
ground fanatics that I've seen out of

852
00:39:40,949 --> 00:39:45,029
the industry just because you're

853
00:39:42,929 --> 00:39:47,639
dramatic change from that huge build-out

854
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:51,210
to just literally walking away and and

855
00:39:47,639 --> 00:39:54,569
starting fresh and so that's an awesome

856
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:57,929
awesome situation yeah

857
00:39:54,570 --> 00:40:00,750
no thank you um I I was part of a Tier

858
00:39:57,929 --> 00:40:04,049
three warehouse and you know we looked

859
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:06,750
for the right space and then we started

860
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:09,780
building it out and I was kind of sort

861
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:11,130
of looking at this whole idea and it's

862
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:14,160
kind of seeing the writing on the wall

863
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:16,829
that this is not really sustainable and

864
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:19,679
I ended up believing my percentage on

865
00:40:16,829 --> 00:40:22,159
the table telling them good luck and

866
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:26,069
walking away they ended up getting known

867
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:28,619
here to license and basically converted

868
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:33,450
our medical facility you to horrify the

869
00:40:28,619 --> 00:40:36,719
key facility which involved lot offenses

870
00:40:33,449 --> 00:40:40,439
and cameras and all sorts of fun stuff

871
00:40:36,719 --> 00:40:42,599
yeah they look really good well yeah

872
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:44,820
when the funny thing is when I visited

873
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:46,349
you it was recreational in Washington it

874
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:47,820
started but you were still medical and

875
00:40:46,349 --> 00:40:50,069
so the medical people could still walk

876
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:51,809
around with their jars and you know it

877
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:54,480
was kind of chill but where you go into

878
00:40:51,809 --> 00:40:56,880
the tear taboos and the regulated

879
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:59,159
recreational there's cameras and you

880
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,690
can't do the same thing so it was

881
00:40:59,159 --> 00:41:04,289
definitely kind of a fun time and the

882
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:07,349
fun thing about John Jason's greenhouses

883
00:41:04,289 --> 00:41:09,000
was built over his indoor grow room that

884
00:41:07,349 --> 00:41:11,639
was underground there's an underground

885
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,980
vault and it was kind of like deal ghost

886
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:15,900
town when you pulled open the door to

887
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:18,119
look down in there at the old grow space

888
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:19,440
that was you know from the Prohibition

889
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:22,469
days and now there's this big green

890
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:24,450
house on top of it and it's funny how

891
00:41:22,469 --> 00:41:26,609
times have changed how far we've all

892
00:41:24,449 --> 00:41:27,929
come from you know people growing in

893
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:30,240
prohibition times too

894
00:41:27,929 --> 00:41:32,399
medical to recreational it's just a

895
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:37,079
whole evolution and you definitely

896
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:41,070
showcase that at your place yeah we we

897
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:44,759
had a little 10 10 foot by 16 foot said

898
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:47,039
that we have we built essentially over

899
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:49,620
the top of a mountain footprint

900
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:51,179
underground and that was you know way

901
00:41:49,619 --> 00:41:53,250
back in the day that was that was my

902
00:41:51,179 --> 00:41:56,009
little spot walk into this nondescript

903
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:58,320
little shed pull open the trapdoor walk

904
00:41:56,010 --> 00:42:00,450
down the ladder and then you know I

905
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:02,430
didn't want to lose that because such a

906
00:42:00,449 --> 00:42:03,960
cool little room and so we ended up

907
00:42:02,429 --> 00:42:07,379
building a greenhouse right over the top

908
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:11,460
of that and the entire structure sits on

909
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:15,300
a basically a floating platform and then

910
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:17,490
and for a while right before you know

911
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:20,250
needed to scale up the bed that was my

912
00:42:17,489 --> 00:42:22,619
little bedroom before the greenhouse so

913
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:23,599
the holy classic it was all

914
00:42:22,619 --> 00:42:26,309
self-contained

915
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:29,389
now we're kind of converting that into

916
00:42:26,309 --> 00:42:34,139
more of like a little storage room but

917
00:42:29,389 --> 00:42:35,849
but yeah it's it's a it's been an

918
00:42:34,139 --> 00:42:38,339
interesting journey for sure

919
00:42:35,849 --> 00:42:40,440
I held on with medical as long as I

920
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:43,980
possibly could right up until literally

921
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:46,019
the last the last day hold down my last

922
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:49,050
harvest and then went right into

923
00:42:46,019 --> 00:42:51,480
Medicare ready to recreational so it

924
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:54,380
kind of fell asleep old days ago but

925
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:57,650
it's you know it also comes with

926
00:42:54,380 --> 00:43:01,110
helicopters doing so I keep another

927
00:42:57,650 --> 00:43:05,070
helicopter insurance for sure well right

928
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:07,380
on man I'm gonna jump over to Jonathan

929
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:09,630
real quick cuz Jonathan before you lose

930
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:12,450
your coffee buzz I want you get back on

931
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:14,610
that roll you had earlier and you know

932
00:43:12,449 --> 00:43:16,409
if you think about it all the people

933
00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:18,599
here this topic you know light

934
00:43:16,409 --> 00:43:20,549
deprivation in general I know that

935
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:22,079
wasn't invented by forever flowering

936
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:24,060
because a lot of people online or like

937
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:27,170
you know II didn't invent it but I mean

938
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:29,460
you know I mean you've really brought a

939
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:31,289
technique in a sense that you made it a

940
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:34,199
company that people could access all

941
00:43:31,289 --> 00:43:37,079
this gear and information to do lie

942
00:43:34,199 --> 00:43:39,269
deprivation and so let's hear a little

943
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:43,079
bit about you know that story in your

944
00:43:39,269 --> 00:43:46,320
background and coming up and right on

945
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:48,750
thanks Eric first of all I just want to

946
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:51,360
start out by giving props to all the

947
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:53,730
first-gen people you know ii ten people

948
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:56,190
all the people that really you know laid

949
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:58,050
this foundation and blazed the trail for

950
00:43:56,190 --> 00:43:59,700
the rest of us to be doing what we do

951
00:43:58,050 --> 00:44:01,050
right now you know a lot of people to

952
00:43:59,699 --> 00:44:03,569
come into the game right now don't

953
00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:06,180
realize that people went to jail

954
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:08,010
you know people went to jail people had

955
00:44:06,179 --> 00:44:11,099
their properties taken away people have

956
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:13,020
their kids taken away from them and and

957
00:44:11,099 --> 00:44:14,880
today we're just talking about taxes and

958
00:44:13,019 --> 00:44:16,679
we're talking about how how do we go

959
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:18,990
about filling out applications and

960
00:44:16,679 --> 00:44:20,909
regulations and such and so you know

961
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:23,129
really big up to all those people big up

962
00:44:20,909 --> 00:44:25,199
to Dennis Peron that just passed

963
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:29,340
recently and all the people that really

964
00:44:25,199 --> 00:44:31,259
pave the way for prop 215 you know it's

965
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:34,019

and having gratitude for all those

968
00:44:35,849 --> 00:44:41,130
people you know thankfully you know I've

969
00:44:38,639 --> 00:44:44,339
been in this in this industry for about

970
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:45,900
25 years and thankfully never had any of

971
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:48,660
those knocks on the door that so many

972
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:51,750
people have woken up to in the middle of

973
00:44:48,659 --> 00:44:53,909
the night but but as far as greenhouses

974
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:55,349
go before I get into that I just want to

975
00:44:53,909 --> 00:44:57,449
point out one thing if you look behind

976
00:44:55,349 --> 00:44:58,139
me right here that's a ruby red

977
00:44:57,449 --> 00:45:00,750
grapefruit

978
00:44:58,139 --> 00:45:03,750
that's citrus growing at 2,000 feet up

979
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:06,210
in the Sierras with no covering in Feb

980
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:09,059
on February third or fourth wherever we

981
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:10,800
are right now so even going beyond the

982
00:45:09,059 --> 00:45:13,340
whole idea of the benefits of

983
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:17,100
greenhouses and how they you know

984
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:20,280
increased her profiles how they're you

985
00:45:17,099 --> 00:45:22,170
know really give that bling of that

986
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:24,600
indoor look that so many people are

987
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:26,460
looking for we can just stop at crop

988
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:29,250
insurance we can just stop right there

989
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:32,730
you know you're talking about a plant

990
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:35,130
that's not gonna get dusted with sprays

991
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:36,630
going on from your neighbor or desk

992
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:38,940
coming on and when we're looking at all

993
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:41,460
the different microbial tests and you

994
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:44,159
look at people you know a green life

995
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:46,800
productions over in Nevada came down and

996
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:49,079
gave us a little schooling on the fact

997
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,760
that in their tests in Nevada just from

998
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:52,980
the test results you're able to tell if

999
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:55,290
the trimmer was wearing a face mask or

1000
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:57,840
not and so when we're getting down the

1001
00:45:55,289 --> 00:45:59,779
levels like that we're really starting

1002
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:02,010
to look at you know all these different

1003
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:03,830
nuances that

1004
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:06,540
we really got to protect our crop from

1005
00:46:03,829 --> 00:46:09,000
not to mention the fact that you know

1006
00:46:06,539 --> 00:46:12,059
it's 81 degrees in Browns Valley in the

1007
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:14,670
beginning of February so what's going to

1008
00:46:12,059 --> 00:46:17,250
happen when your full Sun crop in late

1009
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:19,769
September and those rains come you know

1010
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:22,769
like all of a sudden you're a plus is

1011
00:46:19,769 --> 00:46:24,989
going to maybe an A or even into a B and

1012
00:46:22,769 --> 00:46:27,509
in this market the difference between an

1013
00:46:24,989 --> 00:46:29,969
A plus and an A is whether or not you're

1014
00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:31,410
blasting it or it's going into a jar and

1015
00:46:29,969 --> 00:46:33,480
that can make or break your business

1016
00:46:31,409 --> 00:46:37,379
right there you can be done right there

1017
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:40,170
so where did it all where did the

1018
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:42,390
inspiration can't come from really

1019
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:45,869
living in Mendocino back in the day and

1020
00:46:42,389 --> 00:46:48,179
pulling tarps and you know looking at

1021
00:46:45,869 --> 00:46:50,340
where where everything was going and me

1022
00:46:48,179 --> 00:46:53,099
and all my friends you know we all ate

1023
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:54,750
organic drive drove biodiesel wore hemp

1024
00:46:53,099 --> 00:46:58,500
we were you know really living that

1025
00:46:54,750 --> 00:47:00,690
lifestyle and talking that talk and and

1026
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:03,210
then but when you looked at it like all

1027
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:04,858
my friends had like 50,000 Watts blowing

1028
00:47:03,210 --> 00:47:06,869
up in their garage or their barn or

1029
00:47:04,858 --> 00:47:10,259
whatever and it was like okay we're

1030
00:47:06,869 --> 00:47:12,000
almost making it happen so how do we

1031
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:13,770
really take that next step and really

1032
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,409
the idea was how do we reduce that

1033
00:47:13,769 --> 00:47:19,440
carbon footprint how do we have an

1034
00:47:16,409 --> 00:47:22,920
income a crop that's coming in all the

1035
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:25,409
time and not just that one crop and and

1036
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:27,240
how do we be responsible you know how do

1037
00:47:25,409 --> 00:47:28,769
we be responsible not just for our own

1038
00:47:27,239 --> 00:47:30,929
bank accounts but for what we're doing

1039
00:47:28,769 --> 00:47:32,429
for the community that we live in and

1040
00:47:30,929 --> 00:47:36,269
for the planet that we're living on and

1041
00:47:32,429 --> 00:47:39,179
so really for me the idea came looking

1042
00:47:36,269 --> 00:47:41,608
at pulling tarps and you know it really

1043
00:47:39,179 --> 00:47:43,739
sucked having to wake up early and pull

1044
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:46,079
in a tarp and then having to be back on

1045
00:47:43,739 --> 00:47:47,729
the farm to pull the tarp at night and

1046
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:50,489
so you know it was like that's just for

1047
00:47:47,730 --> 00:47:53,780
the birds right there so so automation

1048
00:47:50,489 --> 00:47:57,929
was the next step and you know really

1049
00:47:53,780 --> 00:48:00,420
you know looking into commercial AG and

1050
00:47:57,929 --> 00:48:03,059
seeing what's already existed because as

1051
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:04,680
we know like we didn't for the most part

1052
00:48:03,059 --> 00:48:06,389
we're not inventing anything new in this

1053
00:48:04,679 --> 00:48:07,858
industry a lot of what we're doing is

1054
00:48:06,389 --> 00:48:09,239
we're just borrowing things that have

1055
00:48:07,858 --> 00:48:11,639
already been successful in other

1056
00:48:09,239 --> 00:48:14,309
industries and we're making it work for

1057
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:15,019
cannabis right because yes cannabis is a

1058
00:48:14,309 --> 00:48:16,369
plant but for all

1059
00:48:15,019 --> 00:48:18,440
those people that say it's just another

1060
00:48:16,369 --> 00:48:23,119
plant and you grow it just like the

1061
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:25,309
others you know I feel those people

1062
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:27,949
haven't really grown cannabis so that

1063
00:48:25,309 --> 00:48:31,869
was a that was back you know four and

1064
00:48:27,949 --> 00:48:35,089
then started the company in oh six and

1065
00:48:31,869 --> 00:48:36,920
as far as I know is the first cannabis

1066
00:48:35,090 --> 00:48:40,190
exclusive greenhouse company in the

1067
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:42,260
world back in 2006 and again you know we

1068
00:48:40,190 --> 00:48:44,590
know people were pulling tarps that are

1069
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:47,330
put in refrigerator boxes over plants

1070
00:48:44,590 --> 00:48:49,460
like it was happening but it was the

1071
00:48:47,329 --> 00:48:51,289
first time that it was really looked at

1072
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:54,470
is how do we make this a commercial

1073
00:48:51,289 --> 00:48:58,759
viable product for a viably commercial

1074
00:48:54,469 --> 00:49:02,319
industry and and so really back in the

1075
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:05,600
day was just you know working in the

1076
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:06,920
quasi-legal medical scene and just taken

1077
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:09,529
every penny and throwing it into

1078
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:10,789
starting a company you know where so

1079
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:13,130
many of my friends were just buying

1080
00:49:10,789 --> 00:49:14,809
property after property and trucks and

1081
00:49:13,130 --> 00:49:17,510
vacations and all these things I was

1082
00:49:14,809 --> 00:49:19,880
just dumping it all into into figuring

1083
00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:22,820
out how to how to move this move this

1084
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:31,059
forward and here we are today you know

1085
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:31,059
super grateful and grateful super great

1086
00:49:31,989 --> 00:49:34,989
everybody

1087
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:40,809
never let me pay his salary one day late

1088
00:49:41,409 --> 00:49:46,159
so I'm super grateful for Eric man we

1089
00:49:44,449 --> 00:49:47,809
wouldn't be here today without all your

1090
00:49:46,159 --> 00:49:50,239
work and all your dedication and your

1091
00:49:47,809 --> 00:49:55,070
are you know give it up for free mr.

1092
00:49:50,239 --> 00:49:57,379
Branstad the OMB and so you know really

1093
00:49:55,070 --> 00:50:01,160
today it's it is the future of the

1094
00:49:57,380 --> 00:50:03,890
industry you know and I think it's

1095
00:50:01,159 --> 00:50:05,750
really up to us you know because on so

1096
00:50:03,889 --> 00:50:07,730
many levels you know I just really have

1097
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:10,309
this this feeling you know there's a big

1098
00:50:07,730 --> 00:50:12,710
circle right of the cannabis industry

1099
00:50:10,309 --> 00:50:14,539
and within the cannabis industry is a

1100
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:16,789
smaller circle of the cannabis community

1101
00:50:14,539 --> 00:50:19,219
those of us that have really you know

1102
00:50:16,789 --> 00:50:21,409
given everything to make this happen

1103
00:50:19,219 --> 00:50:22,459
and neither of us can exist without the

1104
00:50:21,409 --> 00:50:24,589
other at this point

1105
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:28,579
you know it takes the industry to

1106
00:50:24,590 --> 00:50:32,300
provide the efficiencies the finances

1107
00:50:28,579 --> 00:50:34,489
the network's if you will to to really

1108
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:36,620
bring this into not only a national but

1109
00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:38,989
a global market but it takes the

1110
00:50:36,619 --> 00:50:42,079
community in order to teach these folks

1111
00:50:38,989 --> 00:50:43,879
how we do things and bring the knowledge

1112
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:45,949
of the plant and bring the knowledge of

1113
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:48,260
the cannabis community into what we're

1114
00:50:45,949 --> 00:50:51,049
doing so that we can really have that

1115
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:54,380
impact on the world and you know really

1116
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:56,630
use business as the religion that it is

1117
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:58,369
today because it is the religion that

1118
00:50:56,630 --> 00:51:00,890
rules the world today and I don't see

1119
00:50:58,369 --> 00:51:02,750
any problems with corporations I don't

1120
00:51:00,889 --> 00:51:05,750
see any problems with business but if we

1121
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:08,809
can bring you know the the knowledge the

1122
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:11,570
sacredness and the the community that

1123
00:51:08,809 --> 00:51:13,400
we've all built into it then we have the

1124
00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:16,039
opportunity to change this world in a

1125
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:18,559
heartbeat you know and really bring

1126
00:51:16,039 --> 00:51:20,000
forth you know everything that's going

1127
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:21,559
on because what we're really doing is

1128
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,750
we're growing crystals right and

1129
00:51:21,559 --> 00:51:26,840
crystals carry knowledge and information

1130
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:29,449
and intelligence and so if we can every

1131
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:31,370
time we're growing a plant in bed those

1132
00:51:29,449 --> 00:51:33,799
crystals with the knowledge that we want

1133
00:51:31,369 --> 00:51:35,179
to go out that's going to go you know I

1134
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:37,100
always used to love to think of late

1135
00:51:35,179 --> 00:51:38,480
whenever you harvested a crops of where

1136
00:51:37,099 --> 00:51:40,039
is this going to be smoked like I know

1137
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:41,480
this one guy is bringing a half pound

1138
00:51:40,039 --> 00:51:43,429
over to Hawaii and these people are

1139
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:47,090
bringing in an eighth with them over to

1140
00:51:43,429 --> 00:51:49,069
Jamaica or wherever it is and so we're

1141
00:51:47,090 --> 00:51:51,440
spreading that knowledge everywhere and

1142
00:51:49,070 --> 00:51:53,720
every time somebody intakes that then

1143
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:55,099
then we've done our job of just

1144
00:51:53,719 --> 00:51:58,459
spreading that love just a little bit

appreciate the educational piece too and

1153
00:52:23,929 --> 00:52:28,969
I wanted to jump over to Farmer Tom real

1154
00:52:25,789 --> 00:52:30,739
quick because farmer Tom mentioned what

1155
00:52:28,969 --> 00:52:33,049
he was doing at the Community College

1156
00:52:30,739 --> 00:52:34,489
and the education level and I kind of

1157
00:52:33,050 --> 00:52:36,890
wanted you to tell us a little bit more

1158
00:52:34,489 --> 00:52:38,809
about that and I wanted to also ask you

1159
00:52:36,889 --> 00:52:41,449
about the feds one more time and so the

1160
00:52:38,809 --> 00:52:42,318
feds came to your house and came into

1161
00:52:41,449 --> 00:52:44,149
your green

1162
00:52:42,318 --> 00:52:46,308
somehow now with you at your place or

1163
00:52:44,150 --> 00:52:50,389
was this at an undisclosed location

1164
00:52:46,309 --> 00:52:54,048
no they came to my house holy [ __ ] yeah

1165
00:52:50,389 --> 00:52:56,598
they came to my house in 2015 in August

1166
00:52:54,048 --> 00:52:58,489
for two days yeah okay so they came to

1167
00:52:56,599 --> 00:53:01,759
your house and saw your grow saw your

1168
00:52:58,489 --> 00:53:05,599
greenhouse saw your where you kept your

1169
00:53:01,759 --> 00:53:07,159
say I mean what didn't they see that no

1170
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:09,048
they've pretty much ly saw you know

1171
00:53:07,159 --> 00:53:11,118
everything we've you know just been

1172
00:53:09,048 --> 00:53:14,900
medical growers for a long time now and

1173
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:17,028
you know we were biding by all the rules

1174
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:20,059
so I really didn't have much to hide and

1175
00:53:17,028 --> 00:53:22,400
you know I would have rather educated

1176
00:53:20,059 --> 00:53:25,099
them on kind of where the industry came

1177
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:27,559
from and all of our roots and you know

1178
00:53:25,099 --> 00:53:29,838
we were all you know we grow organic

1179
00:53:27,559 --> 00:53:31,519
vegetables along with our cannabis and

1180
00:53:29,838 --> 00:53:34,219
for us it's more like a lifestyle a

1181
00:53:31,518 --> 00:53:36,228
health choice for my wife so you know

1182
00:53:34,219 --> 00:53:38,179
she can you know if she can't live in

1183
00:53:36,228 --> 00:53:41,028
the city she can't be around you know

1184
00:53:38,179 --> 00:53:42,558
petrochemical products perfumes any of

1185
00:53:41,028 --> 00:53:45,708
that kind of stuff so we created this

1186
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:48,289
lifestyle and you know it's it's work

1187
00:53:45,708 --> 00:53:50,208
for us and having them them here they've

1188
00:53:48,289 --> 00:53:53,778
actually become pretty good friends I'm

1189
00:53:50,208 --> 00:53:56,719
in contact with them they're they're

1190
00:53:53,778 --> 00:53:59,509
scientists basically this is that agents

1191
00:53:56,719 --> 00:54:01,278
from the CDC and NIOSH in NIOSH stands

1192
00:53:59,509 --> 00:54:05,239
for National Institute of Occupational

1193
00:54:01,278 --> 00:54:08,059
Safety and Health and basically their

1194
00:54:05,239 --> 00:54:11,420
PhD scientists then and they wanted to

1195
00:54:08,059 --> 00:54:14,420
get ahead of the ball on a worldwide

1196
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:16,818
platform before another group did it

1197
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:20,209
these guys are the premier people on

1198
00:54:16,818 --> 00:54:22,420
workers safety and health and they

1199
00:54:20,208 --> 00:54:26,328
wanted to get a jump on cannabis and

1200
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:29,809
this all really went back to Denver in

1201
00:54:26,329 --> 00:54:32,028
like 2011 and 12 when the police union

1202
00:54:29,809 --> 00:54:33,920
up there filed a complaint with OSHA

1203
00:54:32,028 --> 00:54:37,190
sand that they were afraid their

1204
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:38,389
officers were in poisoned with molds and

1205
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:40,099
stuff when they would go into these

1206
00:54:38,389 --> 00:54:41,179
grows the labs would be off for a couple

1207
00:54:40,099 --> 00:54:43,039
days and they'd be in there like

1208
00:54:41,179 --> 00:54:45,948
cleaning up that there would be powdery

1209
00:54:43,039 --> 00:54:47,809
mildews and you know black molds and

1210
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:50,989
stuff like that so the Obama

1211
00:54:47,809 --> 00:54:52,690
administration allocated funds to do

1212
00:54:50,989 --> 00:54:55,530
this workplace health and safety

1213
00:54:52,690 --> 00:54:59,730
evaluation it's just basically

1214
00:54:55,530 --> 00:55:02,280
scientific study and so they came twice

1215
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:05,699
we you know we and the first time was on

1216
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:08,610
my it was my dime and you know I'm being

1217
00:55:05,699 --> 00:55:11,129
a advocate for so long I mean we showed

1218
00:55:08,610 --> 00:55:14,130
him we smoked around them and you know

1219
00:55:11,130 --> 00:55:16,260
showed him our lifestyle and the second

1220
00:55:14,130 --> 00:55:18,809
time was more business orientated and

1221
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:20,850
they were collecting data for production

1222
00:55:18,809 --> 00:55:24,239
and processing so each day I did a

1223
00:55:20,849 --> 00:55:26,789
different task we had a total of like 70

1224
00:55:24,239 --> 00:55:29,549
plants that year and by the time they

1225
00:55:26,789 --> 00:55:31,739
came in the later part of October we had

1226
00:55:29,550 --> 00:55:34,800
10 left so the first day was all about

1227
00:55:31,739 --> 00:55:36,809
big leafing and harvesting so we

1228
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:39,930
harvested the temp lamps and then big

1229
00:55:36,809 --> 00:55:42,210
leaved and then moved it into the dryer

1230
00:55:39,929 --> 00:55:45,089
and the second day was all about bucking

1231
00:55:42,210 --> 00:55:47,820
so we were taking the beds off of the

1232
00:55:45,090 --> 00:55:51,150
off of the stems form every different

1233
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:53,880
way we could come from the hand to the

1234
00:55:51,150 --> 00:55:55,740
little tin can method to the scissors to

1235
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:58,380
what which ever way we could to give

1236
00:55:55,739 --> 00:56:00,750
them data and then the third day was all

1237
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:03,090
about trimming we had Madrid machine

1238
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:05,159
trims hand trim that hooked us up with

1239
00:56:03,090 --> 00:56:08,760
the cyber glove that tracked repetitive

1240
00:56:05,159 --> 00:56:12,599
motion and collected the data and all

1241
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:15,380
that data was compiled and yeah so now

1242
00:56:12,599 --> 00:56:18,509
it's it's a scientific study paid by the

1243
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:21,030
paid for by the you know of the

1244
00:56:18,510 --> 00:56:22,830
government and the people so it's in the

1245
00:56:21,030 --> 00:56:24,860
Library of Congress and I guess you

1246
00:56:22,829 --> 00:56:28,769
could look it up under cannabis and

1247
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:31,170
organic cannabis farm so so organic

1248
00:56:28,769 --> 00:56:33,090
cannabis is the keyword in that study or

1249
00:56:31,170 --> 00:56:35,159
what you showed them basically it was

1250
00:56:33,090 --> 00:56:39,120
you know coming from an organic place

1251
00:56:35,159 --> 00:56:41,399
and using greenhouses and things like

1252
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:43,650
that it sounds like I mean it sounds

1253
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:47,780
like you showed them the side that we

1254
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:49,950
all kind of are all an advocate for oh

1255
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:51,420
definitely I mean I wanted to show them

1256
00:56:49,949 --> 00:56:53,429
what we were all about and what we can

1257
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:55,950
what we came from and really give them a

1258
00:56:53,429 --> 00:56:58,769
good perception of where we all came

1259
00:56:55,949 --> 00:57:00,960
from it who we really are as a community

1260
00:56:58,769 --> 00:57:02,519
how do I choose you again I forgot did

1261
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:04,230
you say how did they actually come to

1262
00:57:02,519 --> 00:57:05,130
you like because you got busted a long

1263
00:57:04,230 --> 00:57:08,550
time ago

1264
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:12,539
no no no we're in Washington State we we

1265
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:14,850
did a news piece with como news they

1266
00:57:12,539 --> 00:57:16,529
asked me to do an open blast and I said

1267
00:57:14,849 --> 00:57:18,299
yes then everybody thought I was crazy

1268
00:57:16,530 --> 00:57:21,180
but I thought well this is a really good

1269
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:22,710
opportunity to educate him on it because

1270
00:57:21,179 --> 00:57:24,779
they were coming to the farmers markets

1271
00:57:22,710 --> 00:57:27,449
at that time and their idea of hash was

1272
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:30,420
one thing it was BHO and keep working on

1273
00:57:27,449 --> 00:57:32,429
themselves so I I go wow this is a

1274
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:35,909
perfect opportunity it's like you know

1275
00:57:32,429 --> 00:57:37,769
it's January February and I can get like

1276
00:57:35,909 --> 00:57:39,989
my friends together and we'll give them

1277
00:57:37,769 --> 00:57:43,019
a four-hour symposium on everything

1278
00:57:39,989 --> 00:57:45,869
concentrates so Joe Winn did an open

1279
00:57:43,019 --> 00:57:48,719
blast forum outside under a tent

1280
00:57:45,869 --> 00:57:52,199
I had farmer Joe Parker doing a closed

1281
00:57:48,719 --> 00:57:58,500
loop system inside and we had samples of

1282
00:57:52,199 --> 00:58:00,119
bubble hash of course and co2 and fee CO

1283
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:01,679
and and that kind of stuff to kind of

1284
00:58:00,119 --> 00:58:05,579
show him that wow there's a lot more

1285
00:58:01,679 --> 00:58:07,500
here than just BHO and when you when you

1286
00:58:05,579 --> 00:58:10,829
ban all concentrates all you're really

1287
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:12,659
doing is you know these kids will

1288
00:58:10,829 --> 00:58:16,139
continue to blow themselves up so it's

1289
00:58:12,659 --> 00:58:19,079
better to tax it or regulate it and so

1290
00:58:16,139 --> 00:58:22,710
that that kind of led to me getting some

1291
00:58:19,079 --> 00:58:24,509
exposure up here on concentrates and

1292
00:58:22,710 --> 00:58:26,849
then a kid the kid blew themselves up

1293
00:58:24,510 --> 00:58:29,370
and a BHO explosion in New Mexico and

1294
00:58:26,849 --> 00:58:32,219
then the Union got in touch with me and

1295
00:58:29,369 --> 00:58:35,009
then we got in touch with OSHA and then

1296
00:58:32,219 --> 00:58:37,919
I took him over to JD's from skunk farm

1297
00:58:35,010 --> 00:58:40,170
research we spent afternoon educating

1298
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:43,200
them about hydrocarbons and why these

1299
00:58:40,170 --> 00:58:46,139
kids were blowing themselves up and from

1300
00:58:43,199 --> 00:58:49,109
that they picked me and my wife because

1301
00:58:46,139 --> 00:58:51,239
we had already interacted with them to

1302
00:58:49,110 --> 00:58:54,630
do the health hazard evaluation it was

1303
00:58:51,239 --> 00:58:58,049
initiated by the Union and you see these

1304
00:58:54,630 --> 00:59:00,090
are punitive type things you know like

1305
00:58:58,050 --> 00:59:02,460
we're gonna come in and find out you

1306
00:59:00,090 --> 00:59:04,980
know what your industry is up to you but

1307
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:06,900
after talking with them and we were the

1308
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:08,369
first ones you know I figured man we

1309
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:10,950
might as well just go in there and lay a

1310
00:59:08,369 --> 00:59:13,349
baseline I'd rather it be me than some

1311
00:59:10,949 --> 00:59:17,608
suit in a you know in some other

1312
00:59:13,349 --> 00:59:20,009
location so we we agreed to do it they

1313
00:59:17,608 --> 00:59:21,808
they made my farmers secure location and

1314
00:59:20,009 --> 00:59:25,559
I had to pretty much be vetted by the

1315
00:59:21,809 --> 00:59:28,559
DOJ to grow cannabis we went through a

1316
00:59:25,559 --> 00:59:35,910
lot of Hoops the Obama it was actually

1317
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:38,579
finished in 2016 and at that point April

1318
00:59:35,909 --> 00:59:40,288
2016 and went up I guess online for a

1319
00:59:38,579 --> 00:59:42,329
few hours and then they pulled it down

1320
00:59:40,289 --> 00:59:43,859
because it was an election year and then

1321
00:59:42,329 --> 00:59:45,509
they kind of kicked the ball to August

1322
00:59:43,858 --> 00:59:47,068
and August said oh it's an election year

1323
00:59:45,509 --> 00:59:49,619
it's kicked the ball to November

1324
00:59:47,068 --> 00:59:51,449
November comes around they go we got a

1325
00:59:49,619 --> 00:59:55,430
new administration let's kick the ball

1326
00:59:51,449 --> 01:00:00,318
to February kicked it to February of

1327
00:59:55,429 --> 01:00:02,578
2017 and they go oh we've got a new

1328
01:00:00,318 --> 01:00:04,230
appointee for the Department of Health

1329
01:00:02,579 --> 01:00:05,249
and Human Services we're gonna kick it

1330
01:00:04,230 --> 01:00:08,909
till April

1331
01:00:05,248 --> 01:00:11,518
I contacted James couch who's the chief

1332
01:00:08,909 --> 01:00:13,798
scientist on it we were you know were in

1333
01:00:11,518 --> 01:00:16,139
contact I called him he said he was on

1334
01:00:13,798 --> 01:00:18,659
home and maternity leave that day and he

1335
01:00:16,139 --> 01:00:21,058
didn't have any updates on it but the

1336
01:00:18,659 --> 01:00:23,788
next morning the box showed up overnight

1337
01:00:21,059 --> 01:00:25,619
at button at my door it had I don't know

1338
01:00:23,789 --> 01:00:27,890
four or five reports and then posters

1339
01:00:25,619 --> 01:00:31,710
that we can hang in our workplace

1340
01:00:27,889 --> 01:00:36,449
basically of what they found and what

1341
01:00:31,710 --> 01:00:39,420
they suggested so and then like I said

1342
01:00:36,449 --> 01:00:42,058
on April 7th it went up on online again

1343
01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:45,480
and then in August I got my own website

1344
01:00:42,059 --> 01:00:47,700
and in between that we I've gotten

1345
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:50,068
emails from them saying that cal/osha is

1346
01:00:47,699 --> 01:00:51,358
using this is their baseline for

1347
01:00:50,068 --> 01:00:53,849
workplace health and safety they're

1348
01:00:51,358 --> 01:00:57,960
using the report that you know our SOPs

1349
01:00:53,849 --> 01:00:59,818
that you know created the report so yeah

1350
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:01,170
that's how we that's that's kind of what

1351
01:00:59,818 --> 01:01:03,509
we did with them that's pretty much the

1352
01:01:01,170 --> 01:01:04,950
whole story well it's amazing Tom I've

1353
01:01:03,509 --> 01:01:06,480
been wanted to kind of hear that story I

1354
01:01:04,949 --> 01:01:07,858
know I've seen you and known you for a

1355
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:10,380
while but I never really get a chance

1356
01:01:07,858 --> 01:01:12,028
we're always so busy and then so to jump

1357
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:13,528
back into the greenhouse talk a little

1358
01:01:12,028 --> 01:01:15,480
bit more I wanted to go over to Josh and

1359
01:01:13,528 --> 01:01:17,608
Kelly they've been patiently waiting as

1360
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:19,498
our hosts and they're good at being

1361
01:01:17,608 --> 01:01:21,659
patient with some of these things and so

1362
01:01:19,498 --> 01:01:23,518
now I wanted to jump into some more

1363
01:01:21,659 --> 01:01:26,159
greenhouse talk on the wall apini side

1364
01:01:23,518 --> 01:01:28,798
of things and also you guys got a hoop

1365
01:01:26,159 --> 01:01:30,268
house this year too and so you know what

1366
01:01:28,798 --> 01:01:31,550
have we been seeing in the wall apini

1367
01:01:30,268 --> 01:01:33,799
what are we seeing in the

1368
01:01:31,550 --> 01:01:35,300
greenhouse you know especially up where

1369
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:37,430
you guys are and your special climate

1370
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:41,840
like tell us a little bit about the

1371
01:01:37,429 --> 01:01:43,969
closed-loop farm and your greenhouses um

1372
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:45,860
first of all I'm Jonathan thank you so

1373
01:01:43,969 --> 01:01:48,019
much you know brother

1374
01:01:45,860 --> 01:01:49,460
love everything that you have to say and

1375
01:01:48,019 --> 01:01:51,170
really bringing it back to the fact that

1376
01:01:49,460 --> 01:01:53,690
you know we are growing crystals we're

1377
01:01:51,170 --> 01:01:55,460
growing sentient beings we're affecting

1378
01:01:53,690 --> 01:01:57,650
people's lives every single day with

1379
01:01:55,460 --> 01:01:59,869
every single smoke that we put out every

1380
01:01:57,650 --> 01:02:01,880
bud we could be affecting their lives as

1381
01:01:59,869 --> 01:02:04,579
a whole or just that minute so it's just

1382
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:07,070
so important to you know thank you for

1383
01:02:04,579 --> 01:02:09,110
that so on on our land we have five

1384
01:02:07,070 --> 01:02:10,670
different greenhouses we live far up

1385
01:02:09,110 --> 01:02:12,559
north in the mountains we're in a big

1386
01:02:10,670 --> 01:02:14,750
mountain canyon and we don't get full

1387
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:17,779
Sun exposure every day so we really have

1388
01:02:14,750 --> 01:02:20,840
to take advantage of our sons are of the

1389
01:02:17,780 --> 01:02:21,950
sunlight and when we light up we usually

1390
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:23,240
are light to Epping right around the

1391
01:02:21,949 --> 01:02:25,069
time when the sun's hitting the mountain

1392
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:27,469
even in the middle of the summer so

1393
01:02:25,070 --> 01:02:29,690
luckily we don't get a really a lot of

1394
01:02:27,469 --> 01:02:31,879
heat in there you know towards the

1395
01:02:29,690 --> 01:02:34,670
evening of stuff but we have five

1396
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:36,800
different greenhouses a circular one

1397
01:02:34,670 --> 01:02:39,349
that's submerged into the earth about

1398
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:42,530
nine feet and then a really long wall EP

1399
01:02:39,349 --> 01:02:44,929
knee that's forty by seventy that's dug

1400
01:02:42,530 --> 01:02:46,670
it's on a hillside and on the back wall

1401
01:02:44,929 --> 01:02:49,129
it's ten feet in the ground and in the

1402
01:02:46,670 --> 01:02:52,639
front walls around six feet to the to

1403
01:02:49,130 --> 01:02:56,690
the ground and it's got a big flat an

1404
01:02:52,639 --> 01:02:58,309
angled roof on it and we also have a

1405
01:02:56,690 --> 01:02:59,690
hoop house that we got from forever

1406
01:02:58,309 --> 01:03:01,400
flower and we've gotten lots of

1407
01:02:59,690 --> 01:03:03,789
equipment from forever flowering for our

1408
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:07,670
other stuff but we also build

1409
01:03:03,789 --> 01:03:11,029
greenhouses from from wood and local

1410
01:03:07,670 --> 01:03:12,650
materials from our land what really

1411
01:03:11,030 --> 01:03:16,280
works for us best is a flow-through

1412
01:03:12,650 --> 01:03:18,950
style design for our greenhouse we do

1413
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:21,050
get a lot of rain in the summer and also

1414
01:03:18,949 --> 01:03:23,029
we can get it really early in the fall

1415
01:03:21,050 --> 01:03:26,450
so we really like to use our greenhouses

1416
01:03:23,030 --> 01:03:29,210
and utilize it more as a roof without

1417
01:03:26,449 --> 01:03:31,129
ever tree you know our walls never come

1418
01:03:29,210 --> 01:03:33,829
down in the summer we only have the

1419
01:03:31,130 --> 01:03:35,480
summer walls come down in the spring yes

1420
01:03:33,829 --> 01:03:37,460
then in the spring as soon as our

1421
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:39,769
temperatures change really drastically

1422
01:03:37,460 --> 01:03:41,510
you know in the evening I mean as soon

1423
01:03:39,769 --> 01:03:42,059
as it starts to become summertime and

1424
01:03:41,510 --> 01:03:44,490
we're having

1425
01:03:42,059 --> 01:03:45,869
the hot days and cold nights because

1426
01:03:44,489 --> 01:03:47,399
that's what happens up in the mountains

1427
01:03:45,869 --> 01:03:49,889
where we are you know it's absolutely

1428
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:51,900
imperative that those sides and the end

1429
01:03:49,889 --> 01:03:52,679
boils never get closed you know and

1430
01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:55,349
that's something that we've been

1431
01:03:52,679 --> 01:03:57,179
learning you know through time and if we

1432
01:03:55,349 --> 01:03:59,250
want to be able to grow these really

1433
01:03:57,179 --> 01:04:00,899
beautiful varieties that are really

1434
01:03:59,250 --> 01:04:03,510
important to get out on the market in

1435
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:06,119
our northern area we have to be able to

1436
01:04:03,510 --> 01:04:10,050
light up and we do it old-school work

1437
01:04:06,119 --> 01:04:16,859
for the birds don't we like birds we

1438
01:04:10,050 --> 01:04:20,010
like I mean I still pull some terms

1439
01:04:16,860 --> 01:04:23,490
myself I know how it goes

1440
01:04:20,010 --> 01:04:25,380
I wanted to know do you guys use any

1441
01:04:23,489 --> 01:04:28,349
fans or any kind of electricity in any

1442
01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:30,180
of your greenhouses we really don't we

1443
01:04:28,349 --> 01:04:32,039
used to and we just realized that it's

1444
01:04:30,179 --> 01:04:33,869
really not necessary we have enough

1445
01:04:32,039 --> 01:04:36,539
airflow on the mountainside that we're

1446
01:04:33,869 --> 01:04:38,549
on just open it up and the way that the

1447
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:41,730
mountains breathe is that we have like

1448
01:04:38,550 --> 01:04:43,769
an uptake of air in the morning time and

1449
01:04:41,730 --> 01:04:45,449
then a down take of air in the evening

1450
01:04:43,769 --> 01:04:47,909
so it really blows through all of the

1451
01:04:45,449 --> 01:04:50,549
greenhouses and we really suggest to

1452
01:04:47,909 --> 01:04:52,529
people you know that before you do the

1453
01:04:50,550 --> 01:04:54,690
layout of your greenhouse as you stand

1454
01:04:52,530 --> 01:04:57,000
on your land you find out the airflow

1455
01:04:54,690 --> 01:05:00,179
you find out exactly what's going on

1456
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:03,119
with your son and your Moon right point

1457
01:05:00,179 --> 01:05:05,460
you freeze points we have frost so where

1458
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:07,199
does it frost first where does a frost

1459
01:05:05,460 --> 01:05:09,090
second where's the Sun in the winter

1460
01:05:07,199 --> 01:05:11,519
where's the Sun in the summer we have to

1461
01:05:09,090 --> 01:05:15,329
think about that pretty pretty seriously

1462
01:05:11,519 --> 01:05:18,809
and we also purposefully build our

1463
01:05:15,329 --> 01:05:20,400
greenhouses to have a natural flow

1464
01:05:18,809 --> 01:05:22,529
through design and we've worked really

1465
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:24,510
hard at trying to make this design work

1466
01:05:22,530 --> 01:05:28,170
and now we've got to a point where we

1467
01:05:24,510 --> 01:05:31,410
don't have fans so we're walking into a

1468
01:05:28,170 --> 01:05:33,900
totally peaceful environment that has

1469
01:05:31,409 --> 01:05:36,719
beds that are attached to the earth we

1470
01:05:33,900 --> 01:05:38,670
have different pieces we have different

1471
01:05:36,719 --> 01:05:40,319
kinds of dirt on our land so we date we

1472
01:05:38,670 --> 01:05:42,030
take different parts of dirt from our

1473
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:44,309
land and we make dirt and we've been

1474
01:05:42,030 --> 01:05:46,850
layering on over the years so we have a

1475
01:05:44,309 --> 01:05:49,199
unique style of dirt in our that's not

1476
01:05:46,849 --> 01:05:51,360
non-commercial ails number one focus I'm

1477
01:05:49,199 --> 01:05:53,339
non-commercial and then we build a

1478
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:56,070
gravity-fed greenhouse

1479
01:05:53,340 --> 01:05:57,690
a teahouse to feed our teas into our

1480
01:05:56,070 --> 01:05:59,700
greenhouses and stuff so we like having

1481
01:05:57,690 --> 01:06:01,409
different environments and we grow the

1482
01:05:59,699 --> 01:06:03,509
plants differently based off different

1483
01:06:01,409 --> 01:06:05,519
different greenhouse styles and we

1484
01:06:03,510 --> 01:06:07,590
definitely realize that utilizing

1485
01:06:05,519 --> 01:06:10,320
geothermal along with our greenhouses

1486
01:06:07,590 --> 01:06:13,079
has been a tremendous step forward for

1487
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:15,750
us you know we've been we started out in

1488
01:06:13,079 --> 01:06:18,150
big outdoor and gorilla growing and then

1489
01:06:15,750 --> 01:06:19,559
moved all the way into greenhouses and

1490
01:06:18,150 --> 01:06:21,119
we thought that we maybe needed to have

1491
01:06:19,559 --> 01:06:23,429
a lot of fans and lights and all this

1492
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:25,799
stuff and we're pretty much down to just

1493
01:06:23,429 --> 01:06:27,059
the cover and light tapping and we

1494
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:27,870
really feel like we've got it figured

1495
01:06:27,059 --> 01:06:29,909
out now

1496
01:06:27,869 --> 01:06:31,920
well you guys have consulted on

1497
01:06:29,909 --> 01:06:34,739
greenhouses other than just where you

1498
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:36,630
are as well as help design some I think

1499
01:06:34,739 --> 01:06:40,409
we helped you get or just provided some

1500
01:06:36,630 --> 01:06:42,269
materials for in Colorado and so did the

1501
01:06:40,409 --> 01:06:43,859
Colorado wall apini and for everybody

1502
01:06:42,269 --> 01:06:46,409
that maybe doesn't know while apini

1503
01:06:43,860 --> 01:06:48,480
greenhouses are in the earth they're you

1504
01:06:46,409 --> 01:06:49,679
know mostly a roof sticking up and I

1505
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:52,380
know you guys have done a few different

1506
01:06:49,679 --> 01:06:55,799
designs the one in Colorado how did that

1507
01:06:52,380 --> 01:06:57,630
go unbelievable they're just so

1508
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:59,519
absolutely stoked with it they haven't

1509
01:06:57,630 --> 01:07:01,500
had any issues in it at all it's

1510
01:06:59,519 --> 01:07:03,599
definitely the one that they put their

1511
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:05,010
number-one strains in and the ones that

1512
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:07,440
were they're really looking towards to

1513
01:07:05,010 --> 01:07:10,200
you know produce maybe mother plants or

1514
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:14,159
or possibly four cups and they also have

1515
01:07:10,199 --> 01:07:16,079
a high elevation with strong winds so

1516
01:07:14,159 --> 01:07:18,079
you know as long as the sides and the

1517
01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:20,819
roof are kind of you know batten down

1518
01:07:18,079 --> 01:07:24,059
pretty well the Wally Feeney offers a

1519
01:07:20,820 --> 01:07:25,860
really good break for the wind and stuff

1520
01:07:24,059 --> 01:07:28,230
like that so yeah they've had a really

1521
01:07:25,860 --> 01:07:30,090
good time they're expanding on their

1522
01:07:28,230 --> 01:07:31,289
farm and getting into hemp farming doing

1523
01:07:30,090 --> 01:07:33,690
other things so I think it's been

1524
01:07:31,289 --> 01:07:36,809
helpful to their expansion and also

1525
01:07:33,690 --> 01:07:38,970
their tremendous differences between the

1526
01:07:36,809 --> 01:07:41,429
day and the night in Colorado as well

1527
01:07:38,969 --> 01:07:42,569
and it just really helps to put it into

1528
01:07:41,429 --> 01:07:44,819
the ground because you're just not

1529
01:07:42,570 --> 01:07:47,700
having those extremes the geothermal

1530
01:07:44,820 --> 01:07:49,380
sort of you know aids and that the one

1531
01:07:47,699 --> 01:07:51,149
thing I just I was I think we would just

1532
01:07:49,380 --> 01:07:53,280
like to say is that in the time work

1533
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:55,470
like places like Cape Town have run out

1534
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:58,640
of water in California seen severe

1535
01:07:55,469 --> 01:08:01,649
droughts water-saving growing techniques

1536
01:07:58,639 --> 01:08:04,650
can potentially outweigh the need for

1537
01:08:01,650 --> 01:08:06,639
you know you know being able to get five

1538
01:08:04,650 --> 01:08:09,070
cycles in one year because

1539
01:08:06,639 --> 01:08:10,989
times people use pots and greenhouses in

1540
01:08:09,070 --> 01:08:12,789
order to get a fast turnover rate maybe

1541
01:08:10,989 --> 01:08:15,009
in California so they can get five

1542
01:08:12,789 --> 01:08:17,170
rounds in a year and maybe that's why

1543
01:08:15,010 --> 01:08:19,239
they shy away from using beds because

1544
01:08:17,170 --> 01:08:20,980
beds you might have to let them veg for

1545
01:08:19,239 --> 01:08:23,289
a week or two to kind of get their roots

1546
01:08:20,979 --> 01:08:26,409
into the ground but it's gonna save you

1547
01:08:23,289 --> 01:08:28,630
up to 50 to 70% water and it's also

1548
01:08:26,409 --> 01:08:30,670
gonna allow your micro organisms to feed

1549
01:08:28,630 --> 01:08:32,650
your terpenes and turkey levels and the

1550
01:08:30,670 --> 01:08:34,989
crystal content and that we think that's

1551
01:08:32,649 --> 01:08:36,759
really valuable and also tremendous

1552
01:08:34,989 --> 01:08:39,639
amount you know we need to look at every

1553
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:41,770
single cost right now it's so important

1554
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:43,780
how can we reduce our cost and still

1555
01:08:41,770 --> 01:08:46,210
grow the fire you know how can we get

1556
01:08:43,779 --> 01:08:47,829
out a highest-quality product and

1557
01:08:46,210 --> 01:08:50,409
sometimes we really do need to look at

1558
01:08:47,829 --> 01:08:53,109
our systems fully and figure out you

1559
01:08:50,409 --> 01:08:57,789
know what's gonna be best for us for

1560
01:08:53,109 --> 01:08:59,319
sure I don't know cause just sort of

1561
01:08:57,789 --> 01:09:00,880
talking about you know for years I

1562
01:08:59,319 --> 01:09:02,559
showed people how to make hash using

1563
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:05,409
water and ice and you know it's very

1564
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:08,740
simple for for extracting resin but the

1565
01:09:05,409 --> 01:09:10,739
real real trick is to drying it and the

1566
01:09:08,739 --> 01:09:13,359
drying it depending on where you are

1567
01:09:10,739 --> 01:09:15,159
becomes a different recipe and I'm sure

1568
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:17,409
with greenhouses it's the same thing

1569
01:09:15,159 --> 01:09:18,880
where someone might be hearing dragonfly

1570
01:09:17,409 --> 01:09:20,829
talk about how we just leave the sides

1571
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:22,420
of the greenhouses open we're in a

1572
01:09:20,829 --> 01:09:24,220
different place maybe in Holland or

1573
01:09:22,420 --> 01:09:25,869
wherever it might not be the same thing

1574
01:09:24,220 --> 01:09:27,880
so for those of you that are listening

1575
01:09:25,869 --> 01:09:30,159
understand that each person specifically

1576
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:31,989
talking is talking about their specific

1577
01:09:30,159 --> 01:09:33,250
environment and it may be a little bit

1578
01:09:31,989 --> 01:09:34,539
different depending on where you're

1579
01:09:33,250 --> 01:09:37,270
growing and what type of greenhouse

1580
01:09:34,539 --> 01:09:39,670
you're using etc so I just wanted to

1581
01:09:37,270 --> 01:09:41,290
mention that and that's a good point one

1582
01:09:39,670 --> 01:09:42,880
of the things I've learned over the 11

1583
01:09:41,289 --> 01:09:44,710
years I've been doing this is that

1584
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:46,720
cannabis does want to be free it doesn't

1585
01:09:44,710 --> 01:09:48,399
want to be always trapped and when we

1586
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:51,250
trap things we have to deal with

1587
01:09:48,399 --> 01:09:53,589
trapping air for instance when we trap

1588
01:09:51,250 --> 01:09:55,659
air it heats up and so one of the things

1589
01:09:53,590 --> 01:09:57,489
about greenhouses in general greenhouses

1590
01:09:55,659 --> 01:09:59,380
were invented for wintertime there

1591
01:09:57,489 --> 01:10:01,539
wasn't anybody on a farm on a hot summer

1592
01:09:59,380 --> 01:10:03,489
day that went oh I need a greenhouse and

1593
01:10:01,539 --> 01:10:05,800
so when we have cannabis growers

1594
01:10:03,489 --> 01:10:08,889
cannabis growers love to grow in a super

1595
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:10,570
hot sunny spot and so what do we have we

1596
01:10:08,890 --> 01:10:12,130
have kind of two things that don't make

1597
01:10:10,569 --> 01:10:14,019
sense we have a greenhouse and this

1598
01:10:12,130 --> 01:10:16,569
hot-ass spot in a grower that's trying

1599
01:10:14,020 --> 01:10:18,160
and to grow inside of a greenhouse in

1600
01:10:16,569 --> 01:10:20,599
this hot-ass spot and it just doesn't

1601
01:10:18,159 --> 01:10:22,300
work and that's why we see a lot of the

1602
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:24,230
failure rates for people in the

1603
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:26,720
discouragement of green houses sometimes

1604
01:10:24,229 --> 01:10:29,509
is because it's almost turned into this

1605
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:32,000
hybrid indoor grow room it's this idea

1606
01:10:29,510 --> 01:10:33,530
that we get free Sun and then the green

1607
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:35,630
house is you know this controlled

1608
01:10:33,529 --> 01:10:37,099
environment not everybody can control

1609
01:10:35,630 --> 01:10:39,319
their environment so to speak

1610
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:41,570
controlling an environment is timp and

1611
01:10:39,319 --> 01:10:43,159
humidity for the most part and yeah we

1612
01:10:41,569 --> 01:10:45,199
can work on the temp and humidity in the

1613
01:10:43,159 --> 01:10:46,819
greenhouse but we can we what can we do

1614
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:48,170
about the leaf surface temperature maybe

1615
01:10:46,819 --> 01:10:49,969
the ground temperature the soil

1616
01:10:48,170 --> 01:10:52,430
temperatures all these other services

1617
01:10:49,970 --> 01:10:55,220
heat up as well as the air temperature

1618
01:10:52,430 --> 01:10:56,900
and so when we have surfaces soils

1619
01:10:55,220 --> 01:10:59,060
things heating up we create these

1620
01:10:56,899 --> 01:11:01,009
hostile environments and we create

1621
01:10:59,060 --> 01:11:02,630
hostile environments cannabis just gives

1622
01:11:01,010 --> 01:11:05,810
up and basically sends out those

1623
01:11:02,630 --> 01:11:08,119
invitations for bugs p.m. molds and

1624
01:11:05,810 --> 01:11:09,950
whatever can happen and so what we found

1625
01:11:08,119 --> 01:11:12,769
over the last few years no matter what

1626
01:11:09,949 --> 01:11:15,109
state we're in for the most part in cut

1627
01:11:12,770 --> 01:11:16,880
in the United States you know we we do a

1628
01:11:15,109 --> 01:11:18,649
lot of our greenhouses especially this

1629
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:20,690
one back here our northern latitude kind

1630
01:11:18,649 --> 01:11:22,460
of cookie cutter because I believe

1631
01:11:20,689 --> 01:11:24,229
greenhouses should be flexible in the

1632
01:11:22,460 --> 01:11:26,659
sense that they can have winter mode and

1633
01:11:24,229 --> 01:11:28,699
summer mode both together and that means

1634
01:11:26,659 --> 01:11:31,609
the ability to open up and to close up

1635
01:11:28,699 --> 01:11:34,369
most greenhouses you know for the most

1636
01:11:31,609 --> 01:11:36,500
part run on two ways of ventilation

1637
01:11:34,369 --> 01:11:38,630
mechanical ventilation that's sealed up

1638
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:40,130
with exhaust fans and intakes and then

1639
01:11:38,630 --> 01:11:42,079
there's passive ventilation with the

1640
01:11:40,130 --> 01:11:45,109
greenhouse ability to open up and close

1641
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:47,180
the side walls and the roof vent and so

1642
01:11:45,109 --> 01:11:49,909
basically what happens is that you know

1643
01:11:47,180 --> 01:11:52,039
the Flex stability comes with having the

1644
01:11:49,909 --> 01:11:54,289
advantages to open the greenhouse up or

1645
01:11:52,039 --> 01:11:56,119
close it should you need to what we

1646
01:11:54,289 --> 01:11:57,920
found is that sealed greenhouse is in

1647
01:11:56,119 --> 01:11:59,779
the most part that are trapping air and

1648
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:01,640
heating up in these hot summer spots

1649
01:11:59,779 --> 01:12:03,259
really have to use mechanical

1650
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:06,110
ventilation because there's no other way

1651
01:12:03,260 --> 01:12:08,119
to exchange that air at some points the

1652
01:12:06,109 --> 01:12:09,799
air can keep up for the exchange rate

1653
01:12:08,119 --> 01:12:11,329
you know when air exchange per minute is

1654
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:14,720
national greenhouse manufacture

1655
01:12:11,329 --> 01:12:16,369
standards but if the fans can't keep up

1656
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:17,600
we have trapped air that's heating up

1657
01:12:16,369 --> 01:12:19,099
and then what we have is plant

1658
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:21,530
transpiration which turns into

1659
01:12:19,100 --> 01:12:23,690
condensation in greenhouses and so

1660
01:12:21,529 --> 01:12:25,759
condensation is everybody's biggest fear

1661
01:12:23,689 --> 01:12:27,679
and if people have condensation nine

1662
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:29,930
times out of ten its from plants sweat

1663
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:32,030
and so what we have to do is back up and

1664
01:12:29,930 --> 01:12:34,130
help avoid that plant sweat and the one

1665
01:12:32,029 --> 01:12:35,809
way we can do that is through

1666
01:12:34,130 --> 01:12:37,789
cooling the surfaces and cooling the

1667
01:12:35,810 --> 01:12:40,130
surfaces isn't just cooling the air in

1668
01:12:37,789 --> 01:12:42,349
order to do that to cool the surfaces we

1669
01:12:40,130 --> 01:12:43,909
try to open up the greenhouse use the

1670
01:12:42,349 --> 01:12:45,739
proper greenhouse covers like these

1671
01:12:43,908 --> 01:12:48,679
diffuse greenhouse cover greenhouse

1672
01:12:45,738 --> 01:12:50,388
covers you see behind me and also using

1673
01:12:48,679 --> 01:12:53,899
things like white ground cover and

1674
01:12:50,389 --> 01:12:56,630
things that avoid Sun or solar gain

1675
01:12:53,899 --> 01:12:58,129
black ground cover black grow bags all

1676
01:12:56,630 --> 01:13:00,650
these things encourage a lot more

1677
01:12:58,130 --> 01:13:02,599
surface temp than you'd want and so by

1678
01:13:00,649 --> 01:13:04,399
using 10 grow bags and a white ground

1679
01:13:02,599 --> 01:13:06,679
cover and even a little infrared

1680
01:13:04,399 --> 01:13:08,448
thermometer to shoot and point and shoot

1681
01:13:06,679 --> 01:13:10,130
the leaf surface temperature of a plant

1682
01:13:08,448 --> 01:13:12,769
can really tell you a lot more than the

1683
01:13:10,130 --> 01:13:14,569
typical temp and humidity thermostat

1684
01:13:12,770 --> 01:13:16,880
that a lot of people want to look at for

1685
01:13:14,569 --> 01:13:19,158
the word control I guess you could say

1686
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:20,810
and so you know we really want to make

1687
01:13:19,158 --> 01:13:22,969
greenhouses flexible we want to keep

1688
01:13:20,810 --> 01:13:24,650
cannabis free and then if we need to

1689
01:13:22,969 --> 01:13:26,480
fight mother nature we can do that

1690
01:13:24,649 --> 01:13:29,539
closer to the season extending or the

1691
01:13:26,479 --> 01:13:30,919
winter time and I know that uh one of

1692
01:13:29,539 --> 01:13:32,750
the things that comes up with all this

1693
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:34,130
is also the quality because we can't

1694
01:13:32,750 --> 01:13:35,539
just get a greenhouse and go okay I'm

1695
01:13:34,130 --> 01:13:38,359
gonna get the killer quality and win all

1696
01:13:35,539 --> 01:13:40,039
the cups like J JD and you know all

1697
01:13:38,359 --> 01:13:42,920
these other people it really takes these

1698
01:13:40,039 --> 01:13:45,500
you know the correct method to the

1699
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:46,849
madness along with being in knowing how

1700
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:51,109
to deal with the method to the madness

1701
01:13:46,849 --> 01:13:53,270
in these tip these specific areas these

1702
01:13:51,109 --> 01:13:55,339
specific areas need these pieces of

1703
01:13:53,270 --> 01:13:58,489
equipment to operate how the grower

1704
01:13:55,340 --> 01:14:00,050
needs to at certain times of the year so

1705
01:13:58,488 --> 01:14:01,549
that they can actually make it work for

1706
01:14:00,050 --> 01:14:03,829
themselves and granted there are some

1707
01:14:01,550 --> 01:14:05,590
exceptions to the rules but what we saw

1708
01:14:03,828 --> 01:14:07,969
this year with sealed greenhouses

1709
01:14:05,590 --> 01:14:10,550
mechanically ventilated greenhouses that

1710
01:14:07,969 --> 01:14:12,500
only had the way to move the years

1711
01:14:10,550 --> 01:14:14,539
through the exhaust fans and the intakes

1712
01:14:12,500 --> 01:14:16,849
whether it's a wet wall or not even

1713
01:14:14,539 --> 01:14:19,519
people with wet walls had air coming in

1714
01:14:16,849 --> 01:14:21,409
at 75 and leaving the greenhouse at 130

1715
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:23,179
degrees and most of the sealed

1716
01:14:21,408 --> 01:14:25,279
greenhouses that we talked to this year

1717
01:14:23,179 --> 01:14:27,349
didn't have the fans calculated properly

1718
01:14:25,279 --> 01:14:29,569
so they did have solar gain which

1719
01:14:27,349 --> 01:14:31,159
created that hostile environment and the

1720
01:14:29,569 --> 01:14:33,828
last thing that happens is if you lose

1721
01:14:31,158 --> 01:14:35,750
electricity you're screwed and so a

1722
01:14:33,828 --> 01:14:37,219
passively ventilated greenhouse can help

1723
01:14:35,750 --> 01:14:40,279
avoid problems if you do lose

1724
01:14:37,219 --> 01:14:42,408
electricity and you know something maybe

1725
01:14:40,279 --> 01:14:45,289
everybody could answer on real quick is

1726
01:14:42,408 --> 01:14:47,549
is that you know I see a lot of people

1727
01:14:45,289 --> 01:14:49,469
talk about you know indoor being better

1728
01:14:47,550 --> 01:14:51,779
than sun-grown endure being better than

1729
01:14:49,469 --> 01:14:54,868
greenhouses I mean some of the

1730
01:14:51,779 --> 01:14:57,118
greenhouse material I've seen is is hard

1731
01:14:54,868 --> 01:14:59,039
to compare to Endor it's hard to know

1732
01:14:57,118 --> 01:15:00,839
the difference and so there are

1733
01:14:59,039 --> 01:15:02,460
consumers out there that don't really

1734
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:05,039
know the difference they just want good

1735
01:15:02,460 --> 01:15:06,599
weed and then there's also the retailers

1736
01:15:05,039 --> 01:15:08,939
let's say that are really trying to

1737
01:15:06,599 --> 01:15:10,739
stick with indoors better than Sun

1738
01:15:08,939 --> 01:15:12,689
ground and then they change the price or

1739
01:15:10,738 --> 01:15:14,879
they make the price lower does anybody

1740
01:15:12,689 --> 01:15:17,009
see any this going on in their farms or

1741
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:19,739
pricing or who they deal with as far as

1742
01:15:17,010 --> 01:15:23,010
Sun grown or greenhouse versus indoor

1743
01:15:19,738 --> 01:15:24,868
and prices wise well I just want to say

1744
01:15:23,010 --> 01:15:27,989
really quickly I think what happens on

1745
01:15:24,868 --> 01:15:29,819
the market is anytime anytime light to

1746
01:15:27,988 --> 01:15:31,828
ever green house is super good it'll get

1747
01:15:29,819 --> 01:15:33,689
marketed as indoor just because it get

1748
01:15:31,828 --> 01:15:36,118
if that's is that higher price all right

1749
01:15:33,689 --> 01:15:39,259
and so I think it's really doing a

1750
01:15:36,118 --> 01:15:42,359
disservice to the green house like that

1751
01:15:39,260 --> 01:15:43,800
sector of the market but at the same

1752
01:15:42,359 --> 01:15:45,598
time I mean you can't really blame

1753
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:48,000
people for wanting to get a better price

1754
01:15:45,599 --> 01:15:49,860
or actually move their product you know

1755
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:51,090
so it's it's kind of a conundrum and

1756
01:15:49,859 --> 01:15:53,519
that's where I think it comes down to

1757
01:15:51,090 --> 01:15:57,270
you know constantly comes back to to

1758
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:59,760
education you know and and I think is we

1759
01:15:57,270 --> 01:16:01,679
still are getting more lab results and

1760
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:03,929
more scientific studies are being done

1761
01:16:01,679 --> 01:16:06,328
you know we're really able to start

1762
01:16:03,929 --> 01:16:08,429
seeing you know what terpenes are

1763
01:16:06,328 --> 01:16:11,308
brought out by it by sunshine you know

1764
01:16:08,429 --> 01:16:15,210
where does UV come into the factor you

1765
01:16:11,309 --> 01:16:16,289
know and and so one thing I just wanted

1766
01:16:15,210 --> 01:16:19,408
to say about growing in the greenhouse

1767
01:16:16,289 --> 01:16:21,689
though going back is you know really

1768
01:16:19,408 --> 01:16:24,179
again comes back to having a proper

1769
01:16:21,689 --> 01:16:27,210
greenhouse design you know I've been

1770
01:16:24,179 --> 01:16:30,828
living up and growing in the Sierras

1771
01:16:27,210 --> 01:16:33,359
here for you know well over a decade and

1772
01:16:30,828 --> 01:16:36,029
decade and a half up here in the Sierras

1773
01:16:33,359 --> 01:16:38,549
and we get up into the hundreds pluses

1774
01:16:36,029 --> 01:16:40,229
and I've never had an exhaust fan on my

1775
01:16:38,550 --> 01:16:43,409
greenhouse I've never had a cooling

1776
01:16:40,229 --> 01:16:46,319
system on my greenhouse and I think a

1777
01:16:43,408 --> 01:16:48,179
lot of people are being steered into the

1778
01:16:46,319 --> 01:16:53,130
direction of thinking that they need to

1779
01:16:48,179 --> 01:16:55,139
have HVAC systems or wet walls to really

1780
01:16:53,130 --> 01:16:56,578
or even high-pressure fogging systems to

1781
01:16:55,139 --> 01:16:58,409
mitigate something that doesn't

1782
01:16:56,578 --> 01:17:00,539
necessarily need to be mitigated for

1783
01:16:58,408 --> 01:17:01,869
coming from an indoor environment people

1784
01:17:00,539 --> 01:17:03,250
are usually focused on

1785
01:17:01,869 --> 01:17:05,050
what's the temp and humidity what's the

1786
01:17:03,250 --> 01:17:06,489
temp in humidity and that's all that

1787
01:17:05,050 --> 01:17:08,230
they're looking at but once you get into

1788
01:17:06,489 --> 01:17:10,899
a greenhouse you really have the ability

1789
01:17:08,229 --> 01:17:13,000
to start looking at leaf surface

1790
01:17:10,899 --> 01:17:15,009
temperatures at root zone temperatures

1791
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:17,590
and that's where we really start getting

1792
01:17:15,010 --> 01:17:19,780
into you know the true growing

1793
01:17:17,590 --> 01:17:22,569
environment for the plants and so the

1794
01:17:19,779 --> 01:17:25,090
ambiance of the greenhouse can be super

1795
01:17:22,569 --> 01:17:26,949
hot but if that if you get the cooler

1796
01:17:25,090 --> 01:17:29,039
temperature is down on the leaf and in

1797
01:17:26,949 --> 01:17:31,510
the root zone you can actually go around

1798
01:17:29,039 --> 01:17:33,310
having to have any sort of mechanical

1799
01:17:31,510 --> 01:17:35,800
cooling and such as but you know as long

1800
01:17:33,310 --> 01:17:37,980
as you've got that proper passive

1801
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:40,600
cooling and you've got a high quality

1802
01:17:37,979 --> 01:17:44,619
material such a sun's coming through a

1803
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:46,810
lot of people like to skimp on on their

1804
01:17:44,619 --> 01:17:49,449
greenhouse cover and put up some sort of

1805
01:17:46,810 --> 01:17:52,780
like visqueen or you know just a single

1806
01:17:49,449 --> 01:17:55,269
layer poly but really that's what the

1807
01:17:52,779 --> 01:17:57,489
sun's coming through right and so that

1808
01:17:55,270 --> 01:17:59,590
is that's your separation between your

1809
01:17:57,489 --> 01:18:01,899
source of the plant growth and the plant

1810
01:17:59,590 --> 01:18:04,810
and so really one of the best things

1811
01:18:01,899 --> 01:18:06,670
that a person can do and the the most

1812
01:18:04,810 --> 01:18:08,590
cost-effective to improve their

1813
01:18:06,670 --> 01:18:10,720
greenhouse is to just put a proper cover

1814
01:18:08,590 --> 01:18:13,239
on it if you have a poly weave cover

1815
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:16,480
that's got a high diffusion level and

1816
01:18:13,239 --> 01:18:18,729
even blocks out of a minor amount of the

1817
01:18:16,479 --> 01:18:20,889
Sun to really soften the light you're

1818
01:18:18,729 --> 01:18:23,259
gonna have plants they get more blingy

1819
01:18:20,890 --> 01:18:25,240
because they're not in the harsh

1820
01:18:23,260 --> 01:18:27,280
environment of the Sun just beating down

1821
01:18:25,239 --> 01:18:30,239
on them and they're not in a visqueen

1822
01:18:27,279 --> 01:18:32,469
material which is actually focus are

1823
01:18:30,239 --> 01:18:35,170
magnifying the light and creating hot

1824
01:18:32,470 --> 01:18:37,090
spots within within the greenhouse

1825
01:18:35,170 --> 01:18:39,489
environment and as soon as you have that

1826
01:18:37,090 --> 01:18:41,050
hostile environment that's when molds

1827
01:18:39,489 --> 01:18:43,539
mildews pests and diseases are gonna

1828
01:18:41,050 --> 01:18:45,730
move in because your plants not healthy

1829
01:18:43,539 --> 01:18:49,060
so it's basically sending out this

1830
01:18:45,729 --> 01:18:51,009
message of I need to be decomposed right

1831
01:18:49,060 --> 01:18:52,480
and so nature's just coming in and like

1832
01:18:51,010 --> 01:18:55,180
oh we're just gonna take this one out

1833
01:18:52,479 --> 01:18:57,039
this one's not healthy and so it really

1834
01:18:55,180 --> 01:18:59,470
comes back to creating that beautiful

1835
01:18:57,039 --> 01:19:01,510
growing environment both in the air and

1836
01:18:59,470 --> 01:19:06,730
then in the soil but that's like a whole

1837
01:19:01,510 --> 01:19:08,949
nother rant right there anybody have any

1838
01:19:06,729 --> 01:19:10,269
comments on the using the greenhouse

1839
01:19:08,949 --> 01:19:12,489
shavon we haven't heard from you a

1840
01:19:10,270 --> 01:19:15,659
little bit tell us about your greenhouse

1841
01:19:12,489 --> 01:19:19,840
in style you guys Manuel Deb

1842
01:19:15,658 --> 01:19:24,759
well currently four blessed coasts

1843
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:31,659
we're pretty lacking to be honest but my

1844
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:37,389
background in greenhouses was my dad did

1845
01:19:31,658 --> 01:19:43,359
black box and I moved into greenhouses

1846
01:19:37,389 --> 01:19:50,069
as the market was still getting prices

1847
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:50,069
for indoor for death for that

1848
01:19:52,060 --> 01:19:59,350
yeah you black box that was awesome yeah

1849
01:19:56,060 --> 01:20:04,130
so but but I mean that was dad you know

1850
01:19:59,350 --> 01:20:06,170
but I then moved into just falling in

1851
01:20:04,130 --> 01:20:11,539
love with the fact that it was outdoor

1852
01:20:06,170 --> 01:20:16,520
and I could be producing high-quality to

1853
01:20:11,539 --> 01:20:22,640
sell perfect but no we need greenhouses

1854
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:26,090
for blush goes so so hopefully that'll

1855
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:27,619
be happening this year but I missed my

1856
01:20:26,090 --> 01:20:31,130
days of plonk tarts I'll be completely

1857
01:20:27,619 --> 01:20:34,279
honest you know it was there was a

1858
01:20:31,130 --> 01:20:36,260
comment made about the trash and the

1859
01:20:34,279 --> 01:20:38,420
just get a proper green house

1860
01:20:36,260 --> 01:20:40,039
essentially that was the biggest thing

1861
01:20:38,420 --> 01:20:43,430
that really killed me about this

1862
01:20:40,039 --> 01:20:47,269
industry was the trash and so I'm happy

1863
01:20:43,430 --> 01:20:50,450
that we're moving into you know a better

1864
01:20:47,270 --> 01:20:52,130
slate for that but also Jonathan I

1865
01:20:50,449 --> 01:20:54,979
wanted to say thank you for bringing up

1866
01:20:52,130 --> 01:20:57,020
Dennis Peron honoring that and honoring

1867
01:20:54,979 --> 01:20:59,869
our forefathers in this in this yes

1868
01:20:57,020 --> 01:21:02,450
thank you all so I think that the

1869
01:20:59,869 --> 01:21:04,489
leaning towards the testing comment was

1870
01:21:02,449 --> 01:21:06,470
also really where we're going with this

1871
01:21:04,489 --> 01:21:10,250
we're really gonna have to step it up as

1872
01:21:06,470 --> 01:21:13,150
far as cleanliness and greenhouses and

1873
01:21:10,250 --> 01:21:13,149
hay crystals

1874
01:21:13,810 --> 01:21:20,030
black box each plant or was that just a

1875
01:21:16,729 --> 01:21:25,699
term that he used they dug theirs into

1876
01:21:20,029 --> 01:21:27,710
the ground and then covered it that's

1877
01:21:25,699 --> 01:21:30,829
awesome because my first experience in

1878
01:21:27,710 --> 01:21:33,770
humbo was in 92 93 and people were

1879
01:21:30,829 --> 01:21:36,529
actually using cardboard boxes to

1880
01:21:33,770 --> 01:21:38,390
individually black box each plant and so

1881
01:21:36,529 --> 01:21:42,579
that's where the term black box and kind

1882
01:21:38,390 --> 01:21:47,450
of came from yeah yeah I remember those

1883
01:21:42,579 --> 01:21:50,750
okay no this is in the ground also

1884
01:21:47,449 --> 01:21:52,960
called a pdh pretty dug hole just in

1885
01:21:50,750 --> 01:21:52,960
case

1886
01:21:58,460 --> 01:22:03,029
yeah when I was up there everybody was

1887
01:22:00,930 --> 01:22:05,159
calling it black boxing and black boxing

1888
01:22:03,029 --> 01:22:07,769
the weed actually sucked I mean it was

1889
01:22:05,159 --> 01:22:10,170
really terrible looking herb at the time

1890
01:22:07,770 --> 01:22:11,940
because the people that I was dealing

1891
01:22:10,170 --> 01:22:14,279
with were really young and we were all

1892
01:22:11,939 --> 01:22:15,869
just you know like what is this what are

1893
01:22:14,279 --> 01:22:18,329
we doing and everybody it wasn't very

1894
01:22:15,869 --> 01:22:20,670
organized at all and there was no elders

1895
01:22:18,329 --> 01:22:22,680
guiding anybody along the way we didn't

1896
01:22:20,670 --> 01:22:29,810
have our family up there for sure and so

1897
01:22:22,680 --> 01:22:33,210
I recall it going back to outdoor and

1898
01:22:29,810 --> 01:22:35,430
yeah it kind of converted it and then

1899
01:22:33,210 --> 01:22:38,939
the whole greenhouse and death I mean it

1900
01:22:35,430 --> 01:22:40,770
just the market you know changed

1901
01:22:38,939 --> 01:22:42,779
everything up that was so interesting

1902
01:22:40,770 --> 01:22:45,450
I missed the days of pulling tyre exciti

1903
01:22:42,779 --> 01:22:46,979
rattle snake snake stories and like I

1904
01:22:45,449 --> 01:22:50,699
would love an automatic green house

1905
01:22:46,979 --> 01:22:53,789
because first rattlesnakes book and

1906
01:22:50,699 --> 01:23:03,359
flying pretty early I don't think people

1907
01:22:53,789 --> 01:23:05,579
understand when you when you have a tarp

1908
01:23:03,359 --> 01:23:07,469
laying on the ground for a day in the

1909
01:23:05,579 --> 01:23:09,059
summertime snakes and all kinds of

1910
01:23:07,470 --> 01:23:11,490
things get into that tarp and then when

1911
01:23:09,060 --> 01:23:13,289
you go pull the tarp it the tension of

1912
01:23:11,489 --> 01:23:15,359
it makes everything spring out of the

1913
01:23:13,289 --> 01:23:18,539
tarp and so you can find rattlesnakes

1914
01:23:15,359 --> 01:23:21,659
and mice and all kinds of stuff and I

1915
01:23:18,539 --> 01:23:23,729
mean pulling tarps yeah it isn't just

1916
01:23:21,659 --> 01:23:26,159
the pain in the ass of actually pulling

1917
01:23:23,729 --> 01:23:29,099
the tarp it's like what's hiding in the

1918
01:23:26,159 --> 01:23:36,239
tarp it didn't get rained on as full of

1919
01:23:29,100 --> 01:23:39,329
puddles yeah I dunno you know I want to

1920
01:23:36,239 --> 01:23:41,099
complain about I miss it I miss it I

1921
01:23:39,329 --> 01:23:43,109
miss riding dirt bikes and having you

1922
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:46,410
know a good time I'm I'm coming to you

1923
01:23:43,109 --> 01:23:49,559
guys now from my office because I'm so

1924
01:23:46,409 --> 01:23:51,720
fancy but yeah what it would a crazy

1925
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:54,660
ride to to be on and what an interesting

1926
01:23:51,720 --> 01:23:57,060
topic the whole greenhouse effect so

1927
01:23:54,659 --> 01:23:59,939
yeah thanks for inviting me on yeah it's

1928
01:23:57,060 --> 01:24:01,740
good to have you and yeah I mean you've

1929
01:23:59,939 --> 01:24:03,960
been around it for a while so I mean the

1930
01:24:01,739 --> 01:24:07,590
history that you that I talk about you

1931
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:09,359
definitely know and that was the thing I

1932
01:24:07,590 --> 01:24:10,500
talked to some people over the course of

1933
01:24:09,359 --> 01:24:11,789
the years and the people that went to

1934
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:13,949
Humboldt in the 70s

1935
01:24:11,789 --> 01:24:16,920
were black boxing in order to sex plants

1936
01:24:13,949 --> 01:24:18,960
and so they would actually use boxes all

1937
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:20,550
over the little plants to sex and before

1938
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:23,730
they put them out into the field and so

1939
01:24:20,550 --> 01:24:26,100
like DEP greenhouse light DEP black box

1940
01:24:23,729 --> 01:24:28,049
lighten up in general has been part of

1941
01:24:26,100 --> 01:24:29,940
the history of cannabis you know for a

1942
01:24:28,050 --> 01:24:31,590
really long time longer than I know and

1943
01:24:29,939 --> 01:24:34,919
I've traced it back like I said into the

1944
01:24:31,590 --> 01:24:36,840
70s of Humboldt County and so it's

1945
01:24:34,920 --> 01:24:38,730
really you know great to be here in a

1946
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:41,579
sense the you know all these years later

1947
01:24:38,729 --> 01:24:43,259
I'm in a company in a the presence of

1948
01:24:41,579 --> 01:24:45,989
all these people doing this light DEP

1949
01:24:43,260 --> 01:24:47,670
thing and it's really like you know part

1950
01:24:45,989 --> 01:24:51,029
of the culture now it's blunt yeah its

1951
01:24:47,670 --> 01:24:52,739
but it's blowing up and so does anybody

1952
01:24:51,029 --> 01:24:54,920
have any other points they want to bring

1953
01:24:52,739 --> 01:24:58,319
up yeah I wanted to say really quickly

1954
01:24:54,920 --> 01:25:00,630
Eric and and to everybody is that I feel

1955
01:24:58,319 --> 01:25:02,909
like and all of us probably could relate

1956
01:25:00,630 --> 01:25:04,920
to this too is that you know talking to

1957
01:25:02,909 --> 01:25:07,500
consumers in the market you know the Sun

1958
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:10,079
grown and the light depth makes you feel

1959
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:12,000
better it just does when you smoke

1960
01:25:10,079 --> 01:25:13,890
something that's from a light depth not

1961
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:15,569
only is it beautiful and flavorful and

1962
01:25:13,890 --> 01:25:17,160
it has a lot of terpenes but it makes

1963
01:25:15,569 --> 01:25:18,090
you feel better it makes you be ready

1964
01:25:17,159 --> 01:25:20,760
for your day

1965
01:25:18,090 --> 01:25:23,159
you know it resembles more of where that

1966
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:25,739
plant came from rather than coming from

1967
01:25:23,159 --> 01:25:27,389
an indoor space you know like you all

1968
01:25:25,739 --> 01:25:29,069
are saying earlier with a lot of the

1969
01:25:27,390 --> 01:25:31,410
lights and the buzz and the vibration

1970
01:25:29,069 --> 01:25:34,049
and the electricity so I really wanted

1971
01:25:31,409 --> 01:25:37,170
to say yeah and also moving over it is

1972
01:25:34,050 --> 01:25:39,000
the weather also the diffused light is

1973
01:25:37,170 --> 01:25:41,190
really important in California I think

1974
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:43,470
of Southern Oregon I think the light the

1975
01:25:41,189 --> 01:25:46,139
sunlight gets too hot and it can blast

1976
01:25:43,470 --> 01:25:48,119
the the plants and the buds and the

1977
01:25:46,140 --> 01:25:49,800
terpenes are volatile on the plants even

1978
01:25:48,119 --> 01:25:51,960
when they're growing so sometimes I mean

1979
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:54,119
people are exploring you know having

1980
01:25:51,960 --> 01:25:56,100
shade cloths in their greenhouse in the

1981
01:25:54,119 --> 01:25:57,869
middle of the day in Southern Oregon and

1982
01:25:56,100 --> 01:26:00,360
Northern California Southern where it's

1983
01:25:57,869 --> 01:26:02,159
super hot and there's even some misters

1984
01:26:00,359 --> 01:26:03,899
and stuff being used above it to

1985
01:26:02,159 --> 01:26:06,319
continue having the right type of

1986
01:26:03,899 --> 01:26:09,269
humidity that it takes to grow crystals

1987
01:26:06,319 --> 01:26:11,189
and and then you know there's all kinds

1988
01:26:09,270 --> 01:26:13,680
of different light spectrums and come in

1989
01:26:11,189 --> 01:26:16,799
but one thing we're exploring is uvd

1990
01:26:13,680 --> 01:26:18,869
which is putting a disco ball in our

1991
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:22,050
greenhouse yeah and that really brings

1992
01:26:18,869 --> 01:26:24,050
on the fall you know just check into

1993
01:26:22,050 --> 01:26:25,940
that that's all they're gonna say

1994
01:26:24,050 --> 01:26:28,070
I'm gonna get a disco ball and hanging

1995
01:26:25,939 --> 01:26:32,269
in here just for you guys and see what

1996
01:26:28,069 --> 01:26:33,710
kind of Terps we we bring up Sam I don't

1997
01:26:32,270 --> 01:26:35,840
know you I would be interested to hear

1998
01:26:33,710 --> 01:26:38,239
about your progression of you know

1999
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:40,159
greenhouse growing and some year maybe

2000
01:26:38,239 --> 01:26:43,819
you're like deprivation experience yes

2001
01:26:40,159 --> 01:26:47,750
where is it on it's on howdy howdy

2002
01:26:43,819 --> 01:26:49,699
uh I've been grown in greenhouses ever

2003
01:26:47,750 --> 01:26:56,510
since the first year I grew cannabis in

2004
01:26:49,699 --> 01:26:59,510
Santa Cruz that was in maybe 70 72 or

2005
01:26:56,510 --> 01:27:01,840
something route like that and that was

2006
01:26:59,510 --> 01:27:05,000
just a homemade primitive greenhouse

2007
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:08,690
what's and friends of mine were doing

2008
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:10,880
darkening for sexy not for flowering but

2009
01:27:08,689 --> 01:27:15,919
for sexy and that was in Northern

2010
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:18,170
California but one of the problems with

2011
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:19,520
the sexing was at that time they didn't

2012
01:27:18,170 --> 01:27:21,649
really understand what they were doing

2013
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:24,310
so they would darken it for two weeks

2014
01:27:21,649 --> 01:27:27,259
until the plant showed sex

2015
01:27:24,310 --> 01:27:29,060
whereas well the research that I found

2016
01:27:27,260 --> 01:27:31,430
when we were doing the research in

2017
01:27:29,060 --> 01:27:33,890
Holland was that most indica varieties

2018
01:27:31,430 --> 01:27:36,380
you can darken for one day and then two

2019
01:27:33,890 --> 01:27:40,039
weeks later they will show sex they and

2020
01:27:36,380 --> 01:27:43,850
they were not staying long and with with

2021
01:27:40,039 --> 01:27:45,800
vege with a uh excuse me with sativa

2022
01:27:43,850 --> 01:27:47,840
varieties sometimes they need to be

2023
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:50,449
darkened two or three days at the very

2024
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:54,409
most but then two weeks later they show

2025
01:27:50,449 --> 01:27:56,449
the sex gist and so it's I mean I had a

2026
01:27:54,409 --> 01:27:59,180
friend who produced thousands and

2027
01:27:56,449 --> 01:28:04,000
thousands of seedlings and then darkened

2028
01:27:59,180 --> 01:28:09,050
them off just for sexing to sell early

2029
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:11,539
known female plants to people and a few

2030
01:28:09,050 --> 01:28:12,050
times he because he darkened up for two

2031
01:28:11,539 --> 01:28:14,180
weeks

2032
01:28:12,050 --> 01:28:16,880
they would not come back so the

2033
01:28:14,180 --> 01:28:18,680
customers were rather irate that they

2034
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:21,170
had these little plants that were you

2035
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:23,420
know two feet tall and flowered off and

2036
01:28:21,170 --> 01:28:25,449
they would not return veg can you also

2037
01:28:23,420 --> 01:28:29,260
tell the story of how you discovered

2038
01:28:25,449 --> 01:28:33,170
like greenhouse light death in

2039
01:28:29,260 --> 01:28:35,239
greenhouse light death what happened was

2040
01:28:33,170 --> 01:28:37,880
I went into a court anthem of greenhouse

2041
01:28:35,239 --> 01:28:41,960
uh cuz I was interested in building my

2042
01:28:37,880 --> 01:28:45,710
greenhouse or or buying one or renting

2043
01:28:41,960 --> 01:28:48,380
one or whatever and so I saw the kiss

2044
01:28:45,710 --> 01:28:52,520
anthems were being darkened to induce

2045
01:28:48,380 --> 01:28:55,159
flowering and I a light went on in my

2046
01:28:52,520 --> 01:28:59,000
head and I let Jesus Christ I mean I had

2047
01:28:55,159 --> 01:29:01,670
seen people darken plants with a tarp in

2048
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:06,489
the late seventies and early eighties

2049
01:29:01,670 --> 01:29:08,720
but I wasn't interested because I I

2050
01:29:06,489 --> 01:29:12,529
wanted a greenhouse that was multiple

2051
01:29:08,720 --> 01:29:14,270
acres and you you you can't hand Arkin

2052
01:29:12,529 --> 01:29:18,859
multiple acres well actually you can if

2053
01:29:14,270 --> 01:29:21,730
you have enough labor but it's so that's

2054
01:29:18,859 --> 01:29:23,899
I saw what darkening could do I

2055
01:29:21,729 --> 01:29:28,279
instantly understood what this was for

2056
01:29:23,899 --> 01:29:32,479
cannabis and so that was I don't know

2057
01:29:28,279 --> 01:29:35,059
maybe 86 or something like that and what

2058
01:29:32,479 --> 01:29:38,389
once I saw that yeah I never stepped

2059
01:29:35,060 --> 01:29:41,300
back for for the Netherlands you need

2060
01:29:38,390 --> 01:29:44,510
darkening because you you can you can

2061
01:29:41,300 --> 01:29:50,239
grow multiple crops a year or you can

2062
01:29:44,510 --> 01:29:53,390
grow one big good heavy crop and darken

2063
01:29:50,239 --> 01:29:55,609
it and get it out before the cold it

2064
01:29:53,390 --> 01:29:58,070
comes and your heating bills are ten

2065
01:29:55,609 --> 01:30:01,219
thousand not what it's a day a week and

2066
01:29:58,069 --> 01:30:03,920
can you also comment Sam on earlier Mick

2067
01:30:01,220 --> 01:30:05,420
was talking Michael was talking and he

2068
01:30:03,920 --> 01:30:07,489
mentioned how he kind of likes to keep

2069
01:30:05,420 --> 01:30:09,409
them a little bit smaller which might be

2070
01:30:07,489 --> 01:30:11,719
perfect for what he's doing and and

2071
01:30:09,409 --> 01:30:13,670
producing super high quality flowers but

2072
01:30:11,720 --> 01:30:15,320
you came in as a sort of like oh I'd

2073
01:30:13,670 --> 01:30:17,840
like to have really big greenhouses and

2074
01:30:15,319 --> 01:30:20,329
maybe just talk to wire that is well the

2075
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:21,860
main reason is is I like big plants a

2076
01:30:20,329 --> 01:30:25,000
lot of the work I'm doing is not

2077
01:30:21,859 --> 01:30:28,599
commercial production its breeding work

2078
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:30,979
and for breeding work I start seeds

2079
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:36,350
thousands and thousands of seeds and

2080
01:30:30,979 --> 01:30:39,349
then what I do is I I want to pick the

2081
01:30:36,350 --> 01:30:42,289
best plants and 2bic the best plant from

2082
01:30:39,350 --> 01:30:45,230
seed it's very difficult to do with a

2083
01:30:42,289 --> 01:30:47,689
little 1 or 2 foot plant you grow at 12

2084
01:30:45,229 --> 01:30:50,688
feet tall you get a really good idea of

2085
01:30:47,689 --> 01:30:53,058
its positive and negative qualities

2086
01:30:50,689 --> 01:30:57,050
for for a breeder it's it's really

2087
01:30:53,059 --> 01:30:59,090
required so I that's why I had a very

2088
01:30:57,050 --> 01:31:01,369
high ceiling my ceiling was well maybe

2089
01:30:59,090 --> 01:31:04,340
20 feet or so and I could grow 15-foot

2090
01:31:01,368 --> 01:31:09,469
tall plants if I want get 3 4 or 5 kilos

2091
01:31:04,340 --> 01:31:11,809
of dried material let me ask you Sam

2092
01:31:09,469 --> 01:31:14,958
about the sexy one more time you know

2093
01:31:11,809 --> 01:31:17,119
for people that are you know maybe don't

2094
01:31:14,958 --> 01:31:19,458
have a lot of power still in Humboldt or

2095
01:31:17,118 --> 01:31:21,438
you know these craft farmers if they

2096
01:31:19,458 --> 01:31:23,929
were to sex their plants like you were

2097
01:31:21,439 --> 01:31:25,820
saying how long if it was it's depending

2098
01:31:23,929 --> 01:31:27,708
on strain you would say but if somebody

2099
01:31:25,819 --> 01:31:29,359
was to do it would you say to darken it

2100
01:31:27,708 --> 01:31:32,029
for a day or two instead of the two

2101
01:31:29,359 --> 01:31:33,799
weeks like your yeah because I

2102
01:31:32,029 --> 01:31:35,958
experienced the same thing I've seen

2103
01:31:33,800 --> 01:31:37,689
plants that didn't come back out of the

2104
01:31:35,958 --> 01:31:39,800
veg and it was a huge pain in the ass

2105
01:31:37,689 --> 01:31:43,130
could you talk a little bit more about

2106
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:43,519
that like your recommendation is my mic

2107
01:31:43,130 --> 01:31:46,418
on

2108
01:31:43,519 --> 01:31:50,869
okay then the main thing is that

2109
01:31:46,418 --> 01:31:54,349
cannabis will take two weeks to express

2110
01:31:50,868 --> 01:31:57,380
its ex but one or two days of darkening

2111
01:31:54,349 --> 01:31:59,418
is enough to trip the expression two

2112
01:31:57,380 --> 01:32:01,248
weeks later that's the main thing you

2113
01:31:59,418 --> 01:32:04,788
have to understand with earlier

2114
01:32:01,248 --> 01:32:08,149
varieties only one day if it's a very

2115
01:32:04,788 --> 01:32:09,800
late late equatorial variety maybe it

2116
01:32:08,149 --> 01:32:13,339
takes two or three days at the very most

2117
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:16,219
and then when you put them back on long

2118
01:32:13,340 --> 01:32:20,239
cycle two weeks later they sex but they

2119
01:32:16,219 --> 01:32:21,948
don't stay flowering base are totally

2120
01:32:20,238 --> 01:32:23,359
veg and you grow them really really big

2121
01:32:21,948 --> 01:32:25,248
and then fly them off and you know what

2122
01:32:23,359 --> 01:32:27,708
sex they are that's almost like at the

2123
01:32:25,248 --> 01:32:29,779
end of that you should also say you're

2124
01:32:27,708 --> 01:32:37,158
welcome because that was a gem right

2125
01:32:29,779 --> 01:32:39,259
there absolute change er thank you for

2126
01:32:37,158 --> 01:32:40,038
dropping that knowledge yeah that's all

2127
01:32:39,260 --> 01:32:42,670
I needed

2128
01:32:40,038 --> 01:32:46,779
talk to you guys later

2129
01:32:42,670 --> 01:32:48,340
no that was awesome Mike did you I saw

2130
01:32:46,779 --> 01:32:53,699
you were gonna chime in a little bit ago

2131
01:32:48,340 --> 01:32:53,699
were you about to drop some wisdom on us

2132
01:32:54,578 --> 01:32:58,689
well I don't know if I'd call it wisdom

2133
01:32:56,050 --> 01:33:01,840
but I was gonna say something it was

2134
01:32:58,689 --> 01:33:06,428
gonna follow Sam rule yeah Jesus him and

2135
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:08,319
Jonathan are hard to follow y'all come

2136
01:33:06,429 --> 01:33:10,449
on you go now what was I gonna say him

2137
01:33:08,319 --> 01:33:12,009
it was about you were talking about and

2138
01:33:10,448 --> 01:33:14,379
Jonathan kind of commented on the

2139
01:33:12,010 --> 01:33:16,929
difference between indoor looking

2140
01:33:14,380 --> 01:33:19,800
quality and how you will be pricing

2141
01:33:16,929 --> 01:33:23,828
pricing and stuff like that right so I

2142
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:26,170
think that that light deprivation when

2143
01:33:23,828 --> 01:33:29,259
done right can absolutely compete with

2144
01:33:26,170 --> 01:33:31,480
the indoor market both in the testing

2145
01:33:29,260 --> 01:33:33,579
results and also the way bag appeal the

2146
01:33:31,479 --> 01:33:34,808
way it looks and we did this kind of fun

2147
01:33:33,578 --> 01:33:37,328
little test with the friend of ours this

2148
01:33:34,809 --> 01:33:39,670
last year where we gave him some of the

2149
01:33:37,328 --> 01:33:41,889
same cuts we were running same nutrient

2150
01:33:39,670 --> 01:33:43,389
program everything that we were doing he

2151
01:33:41,889 --> 01:33:44,949
ran it indoors we ran it in a light

2152
01:33:43,389 --> 01:33:47,050
deprivation and we tested it at the end

2153
01:33:44,948 --> 01:33:49,658
of the year and we ended up being higher

2154
01:33:47,050 --> 01:33:53,679
on the THC test and you know everything

2155
01:33:49,658 --> 01:33:56,618
else that that we both tested for which

2156
01:33:53,679 --> 01:33:59,078
was basically the TAC thing was the with

2157
01:33:56,618 --> 01:34:02,710
the competition so sometimes when I hear

2158
01:33:59,078 --> 01:34:04,179
people talking about the indoor there's

2159
01:34:02,710 --> 01:34:06,250
no way you can compete with the indoor

2160
01:34:04,179 --> 01:34:08,020
market I think that's a false I think

2161
01:34:06,250 --> 01:34:11,979
that I've you know and I agree with what

2162
01:34:08,020 --> 01:34:13,989
the people at Dragonfly were saying is

2163
01:34:11,979 --> 01:34:16,149
that it everything about it's better

2164
01:34:13,988 --> 01:34:20,078
it's grown naturally in the Sun case

2165
01:34:16,149 --> 01:34:22,118
better better for you and and then when

2166
01:34:20,078 --> 01:34:25,118
it with pricing you know like with with

2167
01:34:22,118 --> 01:34:27,788
what um and this is just kind of my my

2168
01:34:25,118 --> 01:34:29,408
personal opinion or whatever I think

2169
01:34:27,788 --> 01:34:30,969
that you know in California which is

2170
01:34:29,408 --> 01:34:33,698
where I'm not you know I don't know if

2171
01:34:30,969 --> 01:34:35,770
everyone's in California or not but you

2172
01:34:33,698 --> 01:34:38,379
know there's a big hiccup in the market

2173
01:34:35,770 --> 01:34:40,530
right now with what's going on and we've

2174
01:34:38,380 --> 01:34:42,159
got this big change in regulation and

2175
01:34:40,529 --> 01:34:43,988
dispensaries and all this other stuff

2176
01:34:42,158 --> 01:34:46,750
that's going on and it's hard to compete

2177
01:34:43,988 --> 01:34:50,009
with the indoor market especially in

2178
01:34:46,750 --> 01:34:52,719
Southern California but I think that

2179
01:34:50,010 --> 01:34:55,329
what could end up being the savior to

2180
01:34:52,719 --> 01:34:58,538
what we're passionate about sun-grown

2181
01:34:55,328 --> 01:35:00,250
farming is I think that with pricing

2182
01:34:58,538 --> 01:35:02,198
going up the way that it is these people

2183
01:35:00,250 --> 01:35:03,340
that are going into dispensaries and all

2184
01:35:02,198 --> 01:35:05,649
the sudden see in there

2185
01:35:03,340 --> 01:35:06,668
the price tag being you know 80 90

2186
01:35:05,649 --> 01:35:08,888
dollars for

2187
01:35:06,668 --> 01:35:09,788
for the 8 that they used to get for 45

2188
01:35:08,889 --> 01:35:15,668
or 50 bucks

2189
01:35:09,788 --> 01:35:17,590
is definitely going to be a way that I'm

2190
01:35:15,668 --> 01:35:21,448
hoping some grown farmers can survive I

2191
01:35:17,590 --> 01:35:21,449
think it's going to be a positive for us

2192
01:35:21,988 --> 01:35:33,248
well yeah educate educate sorry you know

2193
01:35:31,779 --> 01:35:34,988
what I mean like Conan we can't we

2194
01:35:33,248 --> 01:35:36,908
quantify things with lab tests sometimes

2195
01:35:34,988 --> 01:35:38,648
because I know that I've talked to a few

2196
01:35:36,908 --> 01:35:40,359
lab companies that have said over the

2197
01:35:38,649 --> 01:35:42,639
course of time some of the greenhouse

2198
01:35:40,359 --> 01:35:46,208
material they've been testing has has

2199
01:35:42,639 --> 01:35:48,010
tested to higher and the THC CBD and

2200
01:35:46,208 --> 01:35:49,809
even the terpene percentages and I know

2201
01:35:48,010 --> 01:35:51,219
that the terpene companies bubble man

2202
01:35:49,809 --> 01:35:54,279
maybe you might know something about

2203
01:35:51,219 --> 01:35:55,899
that with greenhouse material and the

2204
01:35:54,279 --> 01:36:03,969
terpene production that you might have

2205
01:35:55,899 --> 01:36:05,530
heard about or known yeah okay yeah you

2206
01:36:03,969 --> 01:36:07,840
know right from Tony's mouth almost

2207
01:36:05,529 --> 01:36:11,859
always the light that the greenhouse is

2208
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:14,199
going to produce like a way higher level

2209
01:36:11,859 --> 01:36:15,698
of Turkey in production you know not

2210
01:36:14,198 --> 01:36:18,759
just a smaller amount but like a

2211
01:36:15,698 --> 01:36:20,198
substantially larger amount and not to

2212
01:36:18,760 --> 01:36:22,748
change the subject completely but while

2213
01:36:20,198 --> 01:36:25,299
I have the mic one of the things Sam was

2214
01:36:22,748 --> 01:36:28,779
mentioning about greenhouse triggering

2215
01:36:25,300 --> 01:36:32,019
flowering as well particularly in I

2216
01:36:28,779 --> 01:36:34,148
guess it was in like close to the

2217
01:36:32,019 --> 01:36:36,899
equator countries where they have 12

2218
01:36:34,149 --> 01:36:39,869
hours and 12 hours of light and darkness

2219
01:36:36,899 --> 01:36:42,519
and often people are trying to grow with

2220
01:36:39,868 --> 01:36:44,259
added lights additional light they'll

2221
01:36:42,519 --> 01:36:45,789
maybe put it on for another five or six

2222
01:36:44,260 --> 01:36:48,449
hours Sam had an interesting bit of

2223
01:36:45,788 --> 01:36:50,529
information to share on that tropical

2224
01:36:48,448 --> 01:36:54,728
cannabis growing yeah that's basically

2225
01:36:50,529 --> 01:36:57,668
what we found is that but even in the

2226
01:36:54,729 --> 01:37:00,399
Netherlands when I would grow big giant

2227
01:36:57,668 --> 01:37:05,849
plants at 1012 feet tall over the winter

2228
01:37:00,399 --> 01:37:11,969
I could give as little as I was using

2229
01:37:05,849 --> 01:37:11,969
these little 60 watt blue incandescent

2230
01:37:12,479 --> 01:37:18,070
agricultural balls from Philips and so

2231
01:37:16,179 --> 01:37:19,880
they were geared towards but but they

2232
01:37:18,069 --> 01:37:22,039
were only 60 watts

2233
01:37:19,880 --> 01:37:23,900
I would use one of those for every ten

2234
01:37:22,039 --> 01:37:27,890
square meters so that's a hundred square

2235
01:37:23,899 --> 01:37:31,579
feet and it absolutely prevented

2236
01:37:27,890 --> 01:37:34,970
flowering not not only that but you

2237
01:37:31,579 --> 01:37:36,920
could use as little as just in the

2238
01:37:34,970 --> 01:37:40,039
instead of giving them six or eight

2239
01:37:36,920 --> 01:37:41,690
hours of light to keep them badge what

2240
01:37:40,039 --> 01:37:43,399
you could do is just in the middle of

2241
01:37:41,689 --> 01:37:47,869
the night give them two hours of light

2242
01:37:43,399 --> 01:37:49,759
that's all they needed I'll just yeah

2243
01:37:47,869 --> 01:37:51,260
I've been doing this for thirty years

2244
01:37:49,760 --> 01:37:53,090
that's a big one for people that have

2245
01:37:51,260 --> 01:37:54,800
been especially in countries where you

2246
01:37:53,090 --> 01:37:56,840
know he was mentioned like only having

2247
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:58,550
one generator only being able to turn on

2248
01:37:56,840 --> 01:38:00,380
enough light in one section of the

2249
01:37:58,550 --> 01:38:01,880
greenhouse if you do a quarter here a

2250
01:38:00,380 --> 01:38:06,020
quarter there a quarter there and

2251
01:38:01,880 --> 01:38:08,480
instead of leaving it on I'll just tell

2252
01:38:06,020 --> 01:38:10,940
you how severe I've done it I actually

2253
01:38:08,479 --> 01:38:14,419
was storing plants under refrigeration

2254
01:38:10,939 --> 01:38:17,139
at about plus three four degrees so

2255
01:38:14,420 --> 01:38:20,449
they're in a frigerator with lights and

2256
01:38:17,140 --> 01:38:24,470
all's I gave them was 15 minutes of

2257
01:38:20,449 --> 01:38:27,170
light four times a day so every five

2258
01:38:24,470 --> 01:38:27,619
hours I'd give them four five or six

2259
01:38:27,170 --> 01:38:30,109
hours

2260
01:38:27,619 --> 01:38:31,609
I give them 15 minutes of light totally

2261
01:38:30,109 --> 01:38:33,710
prevent a flower and they stayed badge

2262
01:38:31,609 --> 01:38:35,809
they also weren't growing because it was

2263
01:38:33,710 --> 01:38:38,480
so cold all I was trying to do is keep

2264
01:38:35,810 --> 01:38:40,880
the plants alive as the library did you

2265
01:38:38,479 --> 01:38:45,409
see that there was any reduction in

2266
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:47,300
actual growth growth practically they'd

2267
01:38:45,409 --> 01:38:51,139
under under three degrees there's

2268
01:38:47,300 --> 01:38:52,670
practically zero growth mmm I wasn't

2269
01:38:51,140 --> 01:38:55,970
trying to grow them I was trying to

2270
01:38:52,670 --> 01:38:57,920
maintain them yeah yeah but Mike I guess

2271
01:38:55,970 --> 01:38:59,990
my question is is you know I think some

2272
01:38:57,920 --> 01:39:01,819
people would argue will they keep all

2273
01:38:59,989 --> 01:39:04,519
these lights on because not only do they

2274
01:39:01,819 --> 01:39:06,049
want to keep the photo period going but

2275
01:39:04,520 --> 01:39:07,700
they're also trying to have the plant

2276
01:39:06,050 --> 01:39:10,310
grow at the same time so I'm just

2277
01:39:07,699 --> 01:39:13,069
curious if you saw any difference at any

2278
01:39:10,310 --> 01:39:15,110
point oh and your and your experiences

2279
01:39:13,069 --> 01:39:18,649
where there you could see like a

2280
01:39:15,109 --> 01:39:20,719
difference in growth growth rates the

2281
01:39:18,649 --> 01:39:22,099
more lumens and the more hours of course

2282
01:39:20,720 --> 01:39:27,289
you're going to get more growth of

2283
01:39:22,100 --> 01:39:30,710
course but that wasn't my goal my goal

2284
01:39:27,289 --> 01:39:33,140
was to I had big plants in the ground

2285
01:39:30,710 --> 01:39:36,050
which I conserved in my greenhouse

2286
01:39:33,140 --> 01:39:40,220
had a small collection on on Mpho tables

2287
01:39:36,050 --> 01:39:43,960
under under halides and just as a

2288
01:39:40,220 --> 01:39:48,650
library and I had a third collection in

2289
01:39:43,960 --> 01:39:53,029
I had specially made like a refrigerator

2290
01:39:48,649 --> 01:39:56,329
with lights built into it which and in

2291
01:39:53,029 --> 01:39:59,300
those I I gave them as little as an hour

2292
01:39:56,329 --> 01:40:02,600
a day it broken up in 15 minutes

2293
01:39:59,300 --> 01:40:06,199
so that they never received really long

2294
01:40:02,600 --> 01:40:10,610
periods of dark at any one time awesome

2295
01:40:06,199 --> 01:40:12,260
thanks for sharing that yeah I just met

2296
01:40:10,609 --> 01:40:14,329
a guy in Humboldt a lot of my research

2297
01:40:12,260 --> 01:40:16,640
comes from old old-school growers in

2298
01:40:14,329 --> 01:40:18,739
Humboldt County and they said the same

2299
01:40:16,640 --> 01:40:21,920
thing Sam was saying as far as keeping

2300
01:40:18,739 --> 01:40:24,079
the plants and veg the guy came here

2301
01:40:21,920 --> 01:40:26,270
recently and did a greenhouse tour and

2302
01:40:24,079 --> 01:40:28,340
he goes no I only have my light on in

2303
01:40:26,270 --> 01:40:30,860
the middle of the night for one hour in

2304
01:40:28,340 --> 01:40:32,810
the wintertime to keep him in veg and I

2305
01:40:30,859 --> 01:40:35,269
thought one hour and so yeah

2306
01:40:32,810 --> 01:40:37,760
to save on generator and power and all

2307
01:40:35,270 --> 01:40:40,430
these things that people deal with they

2308
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:42,470
can't use all this electricity or access

2309
01:40:40,430 --> 01:40:44,810
to it maybe in the middle of the night

2310
01:40:42,470 --> 01:40:47,150
you know so when he told me that in the

2311
01:40:44,810 --> 01:40:49,520
veg period he that he only uses the

2312
01:40:47,149 --> 01:40:51,739
light for one hour in the middle of the

2313
01:40:49,520 --> 01:40:53,570
night I was just like holy crap and now

2314
01:40:51,739 --> 01:40:55,429
I'm starting to hear little bits and

2315
01:40:53,569 --> 01:40:57,649
pieces of it and then of course now Sam

2316
01:40:55,430 --> 01:41:00,470
is kind of confirming that whole thing

2317
01:40:57,649 --> 01:41:02,149
too so I mean I'm gonna try it you know

2318
01:41:00,470 --> 01:41:04,100
like I think it's pretty cool I want to

2319
01:41:02,149 --> 01:41:05,239
try the sexing stuff and play around

2320
01:41:04,100 --> 01:41:16,100
with all those things I like doing

2321
01:41:05,239 --> 01:41:20,269
experiments and less time less lumens

2322
01:41:16,100 --> 01:41:23,600
maybe two hours to prevent flowering

2323
01:41:20,270 --> 01:41:25,580
right so keep that in mind is your sort

2324
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:29,960
of recipe as you get into it well yeah

2325
01:41:25,579 --> 01:41:30,949
because sorry so that I'm just I just

2326
01:41:29,960 --> 01:41:32,390
want to make sure I'm here and you're

2327
01:41:30,949 --> 01:41:35,389
right so the thought process is don't

2328
01:41:32,390 --> 01:41:36,710
don't give him a long period of no light

2329
01:41:35,390 --> 01:41:39,170
you're saying just break it up and

2330
01:41:36,710 --> 01:41:42,439
you're turning the light on for 15

2331
01:41:39,170 --> 01:41:44,210
minutes every hour I've heard that and I

2332
01:41:42,439 --> 01:41:46,609
know Sam was saying that for his library

2333
01:41:44,210 --> 01:41:46,880
and part of his experimentation was to

2334
01:41:46,609 --> 01:41:48,619
keep

2335
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:51,409
these plants from growing but to keep

2336
01:41:48,619 --> 01:41:53,510
the library and so he said he'd dosed

2337
01:41:51,408 --> 01:41:55,729
him in a couple times 15 minutes at a

2338
01:41:53,510 --> 01:41:57,739
time if I heard you right Sam and then

2339
01:41:55,729 --> 01:42:00,189
two hours and what he were just

2340
01:41:57,738 --> 01:42:07,968
confirming was the two hours for a low

2341
01:42:00,189 --> 01:42:09,349
lumen light right exactly and that's

2342
01:42:07,969 --> 01:42:11,569
what I think up and humbled the guys

2343
01:42:09,350 --> 01:42:13,250
using like a thousand watt light just I

2344
01:42:11,569 --> 01:42:16,009
don't know how many or whatever but he

2345
01:42:13,250 --> 01:42:17,689
does this burst of light for one hour so

2346
01:42:16,010 --> 01:42:20,090
I'm imagining if it's one hour working

2347
01:42:17,689 --> 01:42:22,369
for him it's probably a higher powered

2348
01:42:20,090 --> 01:42:24,289
light I should ask him but that was how

2349
01:42:22,369 --> 01:42:26,149
he dealt with power concerns and

2350
01:42:24,289 --> 01:42:28,130
generators and all these things because

2351
01:42:26,149 --> 01:42:30,049
he was laughing at all the people that

2352
01:42:28,130 --> 01:42:31,819
run generators for a few hours in the

2353
01:42:30,050 --> 01:42:34,670
morning a few hours at night they're

2354
01:42:31,819 --> 01:42:37,460
getting fuel deliveries you know every

2355
01:42:34,670 --> 01:42:39,679
week out to their mountain and you know

2356
01:42:37,460 --> 01:42:42,139
this dudes using the light one time and

2357
01:42:39,679 --> 01:42:43,730
and his bro both rate seems to be fine

2358
01:42:42,139 --> 01:42:45,590
for what he's doing because again a lot

2359
01:42:43,729 --> 01:42:47,869
of people are trying to just keep their

2360
01:42:45,590 --> 01:42:50,179
plants in check and then the Sun does

2361
01:42:47,869 --> 01:42:52,250
the production yeah that's really

2362
01:42:50,179 --> 01:42:53,569
important to keep everything efficient

2363
01:42:52,250 --> 01:42:55,010
you know we're talking about water and

2364
01:42:53,569 --> 01:42:56,899
now we're talking about ways to save

2365
01:42:55,010 --> 01:42:58,610
electricity and that's the biggest thing

2366
01:42:56,899 --> 01:43:01,638
about the greenhouse is to try to become

2367
01:42:58,609 --> 01:43:04,069
more efficient so you know utilizing

2368
01:43:01,639 --> 01:43:07,100
less light within the greenhouse any way

2369
01:43:04,069 --> 01:43:09,289
we can is super super important thanks

2370
01:43:07,100 --> 01:43:12,850
for that Sam that was sweet and create

2371
01:43:09,289 --> 01:43:15,439
that conversation is important as far as

2372
01:43:12,850 --> 01:43:17,870
you know terpenes and stuff I mean

2373
01:43:15,439 --> 01:43:22,069
that's most definitely what we find and

2374
01:43:17,869 --> 01:43:25,550
we even try and really sell our urban El

2375
01:43:22,069 --> 01:43:27,469
possible and as greenhouse and we we

2376
01:43:25,550 --> 01:43:29,779
almost force it you know and people are

2377
01:43:27,469 --> 01:43:31,399
like well you know people are dead at

2378
01:43:29,779 --> 01:43:34,250
added I'm like well guess what people

2379
01:43:31,399 --> 01:43:34,819
can learn now that this is how sweet it

2380
01:43:34,250 --> 01:43:36,679
looks

2381
01:43:34,819 --> 01:43:39,799
we've even not sold it if somebody was

2382
01:43:36,679 --> 01:43:44,960
going to sell it as indoors yeah well

2383
01:43:39,800 --> 01:43:48,340
actually it's been important to us that

2384
01:43:44,960 --> 01:43:51,260
really beautiful amazing gorgeous smelly

2385
01:43:48,340 --> 01:43:53,060
flowers can be grown under the Sun and a

2386
01:43:51,260 --> 01:43:55,159
light depth situation even as far north

2387
01:43:53,060 --> 01:43:57,979
in British Columbia and it's not just a

2388
01:43:55,158 --> 01:44:00,859
California thing or Colorado or whatever

2389
01:43:57,979 --> 01:44:04,550
in Washington that happens in Oregon and

2390
01:44:00,859 --> 01:44:05,988
that we've even sent we had our and we

2391
01:44:04,550 --> 01:44:08,869
entered it into the High Times Cannabis

2392
01:44:05,988 --> 01:44:11,658
Cup in Denver the first legal one first

2393
01:44:08,868 --> 01:44:15,408
legal year and it was Green House wheat

2394
01:44:11,658 --> 01:44:20,509
from our place and we kind of like used

2395
01:44:15,408 --> 01:44:28,879
gnomes the Nome Express and and we got

2396
01:44:20,510 --> 01:44:31,670
in the top ten indoor-outdoor was just

2397
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:33,769
the collar time and boom there we were

2398
01:44:31,670 --> 01:44:36,859
to size up on the big screen we didn't

2399
01:44:33,769 --> 01:44:38,510
even go to the to the thing decide you

2400
01:44:36,859 --> 01:44:40,908
know we'll see and when we told Danny

2401
01:44:38,510 --> 01:44:42,820
Danko that it was BC greenhouse he

2402
01:44:40,908 --> 01:44:45,198
almost fell over it was really uh

2403
01:44:42,819 --> 01:44:46,578
beautiful own and we were walking around

2404
01:44:45,198 --> 01:44:48,169
there for the weekend we were kind of

2405
01:44:46,578 --> 01:44:50,569
smoking a bunch of people speed we were

2406
01:44:48,170 --> 01:44:52,670
like you know there's not like actually

2407
01:44:50,569 --> 01:44:55,639
that much flavor and a bunch of this

2408
01:44:52,670 --> 01:44:57,288
stuff so I think that you know we might

2409
01:44:55,639 --> 01:44:59,690
actually do pretty good and so we did

2410
01:44:57,288 --> 01:45:01,849
but so I think hearing has a lot to do

2411
01:44:59,689 --> 01:45:04,549
with it - but the greenhouse effect is

2412
01:45:01,849 --> 01:45:06,529
an effect it means something flavors

2413
01:45:04,550 --> 01:45:08,449
important to people I mean let's let's

2414
01:45:06,529 --> 01:45:10,609
you know I mean that's that's the main

2415
01:45:08,448 --> 01:45:12,319
things being able to open the bag and

2416
01:45:10,609 --> 01:45:14,179
smell it is one of the first things that

2417
01:45:12,319 --> 01:45:16,009
everybody looks for if it doesn't have

2418
01:45:14,179 --> 01:45:18,380
any smell it's not gonna go much further

2419
01:45:16,010 --> 01:45:21,498
than that and so you know obviously

2420
01:45:18,380 --> 01:45:23,690
curing is a big part of the process for

2421
01:45:21,498 --> 01:45:25,309
everybody and you know you can see Jason

2422
01:45:23,689 --> 01:45:28,359
in the background there it looks like

2423
01:45:25,309 --> 01:45:31,639
you got some [ __ ] drying right now and

2424
01:45:28,359 --> 01:45:34,458
yeah the whole curing process is really

2425
01:45:31,639 --> 01:45:36,349
crucial to retain those terpenes but you

2426
01:45:34,458 --> 01:45:39,738
know you're also growing up north on the

2427
01:45:36,349 --> 01:45:41,748
islands and kind of places that you know

2428
01:45:39,738 --> 01:45:45,678
most people would probably say that it

2429
01:45:41,748 --> 01:45:46,849
would be difficult it is and you know a

2430
01:45:45,679 --> 01:45:48,679
lot of people laughed at me when I

2431
01:45:46,849 --> 01:45:51,828
talked about getting the greenhouse in

2432
01:45:48,679 --> 01:45:53,090
western Washington I was I was

2433
01:45:51,828 --> 01:45:55,308
definitely the first customer of

2434
01:45:53,090 --> 01:45:58,670
northern ice gardening picking up a

2435
01:45:55,309 --> 01:46:02,748
greenhouse and just to just to add to

2436
01:45:58,670 --> 01:46:05,868
the terpene conversation you know we we

2437
01:46:02,748 --> 01:46:08,688
want a an award for you know highest

2438
01:46:05,868 --> 01:46:10,719
level of Turkey there's lime money in

2439
01:46:08,689 --> 01:46:15,489
our in do fish

2440
01:46:10,719 --> 01:46:18,760
terkoz and you know just you know with

2441
01:46:15,488 --> 01:46:22,988
the with the market being so focused on

2442
01:46:18,760 --> 01:46:25,210
THC and you know that like if it doesn't

2443
01:46:22,988 --> 01:46:25,509
test over 20 you know stores don't want

2444
01:46:25,210 --> 01:46:27,819
it

2445
01:46:25,510 --> 01:46:30,940
but now there's kind of a little bit of

2446
01:46:27,819 --> 01:46:33,279
a shift with people wanting to see

2447
01:46:30,939 --> 01:46:35,828
chirping results almost on the test on

2448
01:46:33,279 --> 01:46:38,380
the label and I think I think as

2449
01:46:35,828 --> 01:46:42,399
customers as people in general get more

2450
01:46:38,380 --> 01:46:44,679
educated you know that the terpene

2451
01:46:42,399 --> 01:46:47,408
levels are really in a lot of cases I

2452
01:46:44,679 --> 01:46:49,960
think more important than THC levels and

2453
01:46:47,408 --> 01:46:53,888
you don't really get that so much I mean

2454
01:46:49,960 --> 01:46:56,260
no strain and growing methods at all

2455
01:46:53,889 --> 01:47:00,099
plays into it no matter what buyer but

2456
01:46:56,260 --> 01:47:02,860
but when it comes down to it sunshine

2457
01:47:00,099 --> 01:47:07,690
it just gives higher levels of terpene

2458
01:47:02,859 --> 01:47:11,228
to feel the high everything the sunshine

2459
01:47:07,689 --> 01:47:13,748
just you know coming from so many years

2460
01:47:11,229 --> 01:47:15,249
of indoor growing and then really about

2461
01:47:13,748 --> 01:47:17,828
I've got maybe three four years of

2462
01:47:15,248 --> 01:47:21,309
greenhouse growing under my belt I just

2463
01:47:17,828 --> 01:47:23,768
I love smoking greenhouse weed more so

2464
01:47:21,309 --> 01:47:27,820
there's just there's just a different

2465
01:47:23,769 --> 01:47:29,710
level to I think I agree I mean I know

2466
01:47:27,819 --> 01:47:31,509
that also some of the things that I

2467
01:47:29,710 --> 01:47:33,550
learned from your project that other

2468
01:47:31,510 --> 01:47:35,170
people can probably help with is that

2469
01:47:33,550 --> 01:47:36,998
you know you bought your greenhouse

2470
01:47:35,170 --> 01:47:38,498
going into winter time so you

2471
01:47:36,998 --> 01:47:43,840
technically didn't need your light

2472
01:47:38,498 --> 01:47:46,868
deprivation system and so you save six

2473
01:47:43,840 --> 01:47:47,498
months and then then when I got enough

2474
01:47:46,868 --> 01:47:49,899
bread together

2475
01:47:47,498 --> 01:47:52,630
I bought the greenhouse light def system

2476
01:47:49,899 --> 01:47:55,719
separate and put that in for the summer

2477
01:47:52,630 --> 01:47:57,489
so yeah I think that's a great way to

2478
01:47:55,719 --> 01:47:59,198
look at things because I try to you know

2479
01:47:57,488 --> 01:48:00,788
in some ways help people when they're

2480
01:47:59,198 --> 01:48:02,589
buying their greenhouses because budgets

2481
01:48:00,788 --> 01:48:05,259
are always a concern and so I always

2482
01:48:02,590 --> 01:48:06,819
kind of reflect to your story of you

2483
01:48:05,260 --> 01:48:09,309
know applying the money when you needed

2484
01:48:06,819 --> 01:48:12,368
it and you know there is light pollution

2485
01:48:09,309 --> 01:48:14,288
plans or a process is going into place

2486
01:48:12,368 --> 01:48:16,538
so not everybody can do what you did but

2487
01:48:14,288 --> 01:48:19,538
you did have kind of a funny story about

2488
01:48:16,538 --> 01:48:24,159
when you lit up your greenhouse one of

2489
01:48:19,538 --> 01:48:25,479
the neighboring apartments I had I had

2490
01:48:24,159 --> 01:48:27,639
Sheriff Department I had the fire

2491
01:48:25,479 --> 01:48:29,739
department literally with the with the

2492
01:48:27,640 --> 01:48:33,520
bolt cutters ready to cut the chain on

2493
01:48:29,739 --> 01:48:35,469
the gate but the fire chief just

2494
01:48:33,520 --> 01:48:37,690
happened to have kids going at the same

2495
01:48:35,470 --> 01:48:39,550
school and you know we've always been

2496
01:48:37,689 --> 01:48:42,669
open with wherever our kids have gone to

2497
01:48:39,550 --> 01:48:43,409
school like hey look we grow weed we're

2498
01:48:42,670 --> 01:48:45,940
legal

2499
01:48:43,409 --> 01:48:50,500
but if our kid smells like it you'll

2500
01:48:45,939 --> 01:48:54,159
just know that it's not intentional well

2501
01:48:50,500 --> 01:48:56,409
yeah that saved our ass for sure and but

2502
01:48:54,159 --> 01:48:58,359
yeah I mean without the without the

2503
01:48:56,409 --> 01:49:02,829
cover in the early morning or the

2504
01:48:58,359 --> 01:49:06,399
evening with a bunch of PhDs run and

2505
01:49:02,829 --> 01:49:10,269
it's a yeah you quit the glowworm

2506
01:49:06,399 --> 01:49:12,699
yeah so so the light that curtain is a

2507
01:49:10,270 --> 01:49:14,200
good thing to have for sure and not

2508
01:49:12,699 --> 01:49:15,849
everybody can do that because of the

2509
01:49:14,199 --> 01:49:17,559
light pollution plans that are needed in

2510
01:49:15,850 --> 01:49:19,000
place but things like heat if people are

2511
01:49:17,560 --> 01:49:20,530
setting up their greenhouses and they're

2512
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,880
gonna be running at springtime you

2513
01:49:20,529 --> 01:49:24,099
definitely probably won't need the

2514
01:49:21,880 --> 01:49:25,840
lights and the and the heating system as

2515
01:49:24,100 --> 01:49:28,510
much so you save a couple bucks they're

2516
01:49:25,840 --> 01:49:32,199
just just a comment on that specifically

2517
01:49:28,510 --> 01:49:34,390
on some of these you know dark days in

2518
01:49:32,199 --> 01:49:38,229
the Northwest winter raining sideways

2519
01:49:34,390 --> 01:49:40,210
gray skies for weeks on end you know

2520
01:49:38,229 --> 01:49:42,129
rather than running a heater I'll close

2521
01:49:40,210 --> 01:49:44,489
that curtain and you know it's also

2522
01:49:42,130 --> 01:49:47,350
known as an energy curtain so it keeps

2523
01:49:44,489 --> 01:49:50,979
it keeps the the warmth in the in the

2524
01:49:47,350 --> 01:49:55,510
greenhouse and you know with just you

2525
01:49:50,979 --> 01:49:58,569
know 15 Gavita is running with with that

2526
01:49:55,510 --> 01:50:01,090
cover closed I don't need I don't need a

2527
01:49:58,569 --> 01:50:04,000
heater and you know at night I've got

2528
01:50:01,090 --> 01:50:06,789
the be huge London so generally speaking

2529
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:08,439
it it stays right where it needs to be

2530
01:50:06,789 --> 01:50:10,510
you know when I open up that curtain in

2531
01:50:08,439 --> 01:50:12,669
the same temperature you know it might

2532
01:50:10,510 --> 01:50:15,119
drop down to 60 whereas with the curtain

2533
01:50:12,670 --> 01:50:18,520
closed and the lights running along

2534
01:50:15,119 --> 01:50:21,340
right there at like 75 76 degrees so

2535
01:50:18,520 --> 01:50:22,660
it's there's a lot of advantages and a

2536
01:50:21,340 --> 01:50:25,900
lot of different things that you can do

2537
01:50:22,659 --> 01:50:27,189
curtain you know without without them we

2538
01:50:25,899 --> 01:50:29,500
could just block out light it's just

2539
01:50:27,189 --> 01:50:31,149
keeping that environment keeping keeping

2540
01:50:29,500 --> 01:50:33,970
the temperatures and humidity and

2541
01:50:31,149 --> 01:50:37,539
everything bad I just wanted to comment

2542
01:50:33,970 --> 01:50:39,159
on on the idea of light pollution

2543
01:50:37,539 --> 01:50:41,890
and you know just bringing it back to

2544
01:50:39,159 --> 01:50:44,619
being a responsible farmer you know is

2545
01:50:41,890 --> 01:50:47,020
we really do we really should consider

2546
01:50:44,619 --> 01:50:49,269
you know when we are running lights at

2547
01:50:47,020 --> 01:50:52,090
night the the type of light pollution

2548
01:50:49,270 --> 01:50:53,890
that we're creating you know and in some

2549
01:50:52,090 --> 01:50:56,560
counties and some municipalities it's

2550
01:50:53,890 --> 01:50:58,600
actually part of regulations that you

2551
01:50:56,560 --> 01:51:00,130
have to have a blackout system in order

2552
01:50:58,600 --> 01:51:02,440
to enclose that light because not only

2553
01:51:00,130 --> 01:51:04,300
do the curtains keep the light out but

2554
01:51:02,439 --> 01:51:06,069
they keep the light in as well and as

2555
01:51:04,300 --> 01:51:08,800
you said Jaso like there's so many more

2556
01:51:06,069 --> 01:51:11,049
uses you can you can utilize without

2557
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:13,210
because a greenhouse itself isn't

2558
01:51:11,050 --> 01:51:16,390
necessarily it doesn't necessarily have

2559
01:51:13,210 --> 01:51:19,300
our value to it right you know but but

2560
01:51:16,390 --> 01:51:21,340
when you utilize that energy curtain now

2561
01:51:19,300 --> 01:51:24,760
not only are you cutting down the volume

2562
01:51:21,340 --> 01:51:27,880
of air that you need to to warm or take

2563
01:51:24,760 --> 01:51:30,190
some of the humidity out of but but but

2564
01:51:27,880 --> 01:51:34,659
you're creating this this this energy

2565
01:51:30,189 --> 01:51:37,960
conserving area right and so that brings

2566
01:51:34,659 --> 01:51:40,930
me to the conversation of you know

2567
01:51:37,960 --> 01:51:43,659
people that ask a lot like should I use

2568
01:51:40,930 --> 01:51:46,329
a dual poly system with air running

2569
01:51:43,659 --> 01:51:48,670
through it you know or some way to trap

2570
01:51:46,329 --> 01:51:50,739
the heat in the middle of it right and

2571
01:51:48,670 --> 01:51:52,480
and really what we see is again you know

2572
01:51:50,739 --> 01:51:54,849
you shouldn't really be looking at your

2573
01:51:52,479 --> 01:51:56,919
greenhouse skin as your as our value as

2574
01:51:54,850 --> 01:52:00,370
your as your ability to hold in heat

2575
01:51:56,920 --> 01:52:02,109
plus what's happening you know is as sun

2576
01:52:00,369 --> 01:52:06,460
lights coming through if you've got say

2577
01:52:02,109 --> 01:52:09,670
an 85% transmissive cover that then has

2578
01:52:06,460 --> 01:52:12,520
a gap of air and then another 85%

2579
01:52:09,670 --> 01:52:15,069
transmissive cover so you've got 85% of

2580
01:52:12,520 --> 01:52:17,140
the light coming through and then 85% of

2581
01:52:15,069 --> 01:52:19,000
that light coming through and now

2582
01:52:17,140 --> 01:52:20,470
there's a need to start turning on

2583
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:22,720
lights because you're not getting the

2584
01:52:20,470 --> 01:52:25,119
type of lumens that you need and so it's

2585
01:52:22,720 --> 01:52:28,000
you know it can be a really fighting

2586
01:52:25,119 --> 01:52:30,510
against the the flow on that level plus

2587
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:33,369
in the summer time if you have that that

2588
01:52:30,510 --> 01:52:35,050
dual system as well now you've got an

2589
01:52:33,369 --> 01:52:37,529
area that's trapping heat and all you're

2590
01:52:35,050 --> 01:52:40,270
trying to do is get rid of heat right so

2591
01:52:37,529 --> 01:52:43,300
yeah the the curtains can be used once

2592
01:52:40,270 --> 01:52:46,420
on so many levels I I tried the double

2593
01:52:43,300 --> 01:52:49,420
cover on a different system just a hoop

2594
01:52:46,420 --> 01:52:51,340
house and for the wintertime you know it

2595
01:52:49,420 --> 01:52:54,190
does it does trap

2596
01:52:51,340 --> 01:52:56,889
it does create you know a little bit

2597
01:52:54,189 --> 01:52:59,079
more efficient running at the expense of

2598
01:52:56,889 --> 01:53:00,250
needing to run more lights because yeah

2599
01:52:59,079 --> 01:53:06,448
you know you're down with like 70%

2600
01:53:00,250 --> 01:53:09,219
versus versus just 85% so yeah there's

2601
01:53:06,448 --> 01:53:12,789
pluses and minuses for you know all

2602
01:53:09,219 --> 01:53:15,939
these different systems for sure do you

2603
01:53:12,789 --> 01:53:17,829
use a lumen meter at all to to judge

2604
01:53:15,939 --> 01:53:19,448
whether your plants are getting the the

2605
01:53:17,829 --> 01:53:22,929
kind of growth rate that you're looking

2606
01:53:19,448 --> 01:53:26,348
for in your greenhouses um I do I do use

2607
01:53:22,929 --> 01:53:28,899
a lumen meter but not necessarily for

2608
01:53:26,349 --> 01:53:31,539
that in particular you know I take what

2609
01:53:28,899 --> 01:53:36,339
I can get the lumen meter though I would

2610
01:53:31,539 --> 01:53:38,618
I would run around and you know at zero

2611
01:53:36,340 --> 01:53:42,010
lumens there's there's enough light for

2612
01:53:38,618 --> 01:53:44,439
humans to see but no not necessarily for

2613
01:53:42,010 --> 01:53:48,699
plants so I would use that lumen meter

2614
01:53:44,439 --> 01:53:52,049
as kind of a you know a meter for when

2615
01:53:48,698 --> 01:53:54,759
do I pull my tarps at night you know and

2616
01:53:52,050 --> 01:53:56,440
that's a good point too and they have an

2617
01:53:54,760 --> 01:53:59,110
app on your phone now called light

2618
01:53:56,439 --> 01:54:01,059
editor yeah so the light meter apps

2619
01:53:59,109 --> 01:54:03,368
pretty handy and that's when I find out

2620
01:54:01,060 --> 01:54:05,320
if it's dark or not and a lot of people

2621
01:54:03,368 --> 01:54:07,149
wonder or try to say oh you got to be

2622
01:54:05,319 --> 01:54:09,189
there exactly the same time every day

2623
01:54:07,149 --> 01:54:11,799
you can't have a pinhole of light leak

2624
01:54:09,189 --> 01:54:13,569
you can't it's just oh my god and it's

2625
01:54:11,800 --> 01:54:16,000
so unforgiving and your plants are gonna

2626
01:54:13,569 --> 01:54:18,219
harm and all hell and it's like now you

2627
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:20,319
can be late I skip five days one time

2628
01:54:18,219 --> 01:54:22,750
not in a row but five days over the

2629
01:54:20,319 --> 01:54:24,639
course of a whole round I had lots of

2630
01:54:22,750 --> 01:54:26,800
light leaks over time I made sure the

2631
01:54:24,639 --> 01:54:28,750
light meter set zero if it says zero

2632
01:54:26,800 --> 01:54:31,119
you're good I mean I'm not advocating

2633
01:54:28,750 --> 01:54:33,250
being lazy and having tons of light

2634
01:54:31,118 --> 01:54:34,899
leaks and that kind of [ __ ] but I've

2635
01:54:33,250 --> 01:54:37,329
definitely pushed the limit to really

2636
01:54:34,899 --> 01:54:39,879
see you know where the variances are

2637
01:54:37,329 --> 01:54:41,769
sometimes and I mean I think the plants

2638
01:54:39,880 --> 01:54:43,779
are pretty dang forgiving and most of

2639
01:54:41,770 --> 01:54:47,020
the myths and the things that we are

2640
01:54:43,779 --> 01:54:48,759
afraid of in cannabis come from indoor

2641
01:54:47,020 --> 01:54:51,159
technology and that isn't a slight

2642
01:54:48,760 --> 01:54:52,690
indoor growing it's just when there's a

2643
01:54:51,158 --> 01:54:54,279
light leak we don't find it for a week

2644
01:54:52,689 --> 01:54:56,319
or three we don't fight you know it's

2645
01:54:54,279 --> 01:54:58,090
just it's a little different in light

2646
01:54:56,319 --> 01:55:01,769
DEP greenhouse as it gets dark

2647
01:54:58,090 --> 01:55:01,770
mother nature is on yourself

2648
01:55:01,849 --> 01:55:08,869
yeah and something that we noticed too

2649
01:55:04,130 --> 01:55:10,940
is that we never had any firming or

2650
01:55:08,868 --> 01:55:12,979
anything like that or even Fox tailing

2651
01:55:10,939 --> 01:55:14,448
any problems we always had like you know

2652
01:55:12,979 --> 01:55:16,069
light leaks and all different kinds of

2653
01:55:14,448 --> 01:55:18,618
things you know we maybe weren't always

2654
01:55:16,069 --> 01:55:20,658
on time just the way that the day was

2655
01:55:18,618 --> 01:55:23,809
going and then we started putting in

2656
01:55:20,658 --> 01:55:25,939
like some equatorial landraces and some

2657
01:55:23,810 --> 01:55:27,650
of the old school land races and then we

2658
01:55:25,939 --> 01:55:30,019
really started noticing that if there

2659
01:55:27,649 --> 01:55:31,908
was even a teeny tiny lightly in there

2660
01:55:30,020 --> 01:55:34,010
that those ones were really going to go

2661
01:55:31,908 --> 01:55:36,710
off and we were having Herning like

2662
01:55:34,010 --> 01:55:40,789
immediately yeah we we had an Acapulco

2663
01:55:36,710 --> 01:55:43,368
gold in particular that was just getting

2664
01:55:40,789 --> 01:55:45,500
towards the end of its flower and then

2665
01:55:43,368 --> 01:55:48,618
just totally revenged its

2666
01:55:45,500 --> 01:55:50,599
its flower bud and stuff and it was just

2667
01:55:48,618 --> 01:55:52,009
a little bit of light that really kind

2668
01:55:50,599 --> 01:55:53,690
of triggered it to make that happen it

2669
01:55:52,010 --> 01:55:55,789
was interesting we noticed that with all

2670
01:55:53,689 --> 01:55:57,500
of our land race trains so if you are

2671
01:55:55,789 --> 01:55:59,149
doing genetics you know it probably is

2672
01:55:57,500 --> 01:56:02,000
important we're really learning about

2673
01:55:59,149 --> 01:56:03,379
having it totally tight but most of the

2674
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:06,109
time it doesn't really make a difference

2675
01:56:03,380 --> 01:56:08,349
you know got to be on it but no it does

2676
01:56:06,109 --> 01:56:10,908
help to have a black yeah oh for sure

2677
01:56:08,349 --> 01:56:12,319
that brings up a good point that you

2678
01:56:10,908 --> 01:56:14,509
know I've had my own experience but I

2679
01:56:12,319 --> 01:56:16,908
like to hear everybody else's feedback

2680
01:56:14,510 --> 01:56:18,409
is two different strains for different

2681
01:56:16,908 --> 01:56:21,259
cycles in the year you know we talk

2682
01:56:18,408 --> 01:56:23,328
about you know three cycles in the death

2683
01:56:21,260 --> 01:56:25,730
house or five cycles

2684
01:56:23,328 --> 01:56:29,269
I've had my own experience where I can

2685
01:56:25,729 --> 01:56:32,029
see a variance in what genetics to use

2686
01:56:29,270 --> 01:56:35,389
in each cycle anybody else like to

2687
01:56:32,029 --> 01:56:36,859
comment I'll not I I would I would have

2688
01:56:35,389 --> 01:56:41,480
to say coming from an indoor grower

2689
01:56:36,859 --> 01:56:43,789
background you know I I would never skip

2690
01:56:41,479 --> 01:56:46,309
a beat and it's like you pulled a room

2691
01:56:43,789 --> 01:56:48,319
down you clean it you stock it right

2692
01:56:46,310 --> 01:56:50,719
back up and if you've got a good if

2693
01:56:48,319 --> 01:56:53,000
you've got a good you know seven and a

2694
01:56:50,719 --> 01:56:55,730
half to eight week plant you know

2695
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:57,260
there's really no reason in a more

2696
01:56:55,729 --> 01:56:59,899
indoor or greenhouse that you shouldn't

2697
01:56:57,260 --> 01:57:01,550
be able to get six crops a year you know

2698
01:56:59,899 --> 01:57:03,888
if you're if you're running something

2699
01:57:01,550 --> 01:57:06,500
that's you can pull down in forty-nine

2700
01:57:03,889 --> 01:57:09,469
days I mean you could technically

2701
01:57:06,500 --> 01:57:12,380
squeeze in seven so if you know if

2702
01:57:09,469 --> 01:57:15,679
you're on it there's no lag time you

2703
01:57:12,380 --> 01:57:18,920
know at least yeah so you say

2704
01:57:15,679 --> 01:57:23,029
we pull six a year right now

2705
01:57:18,920 --> 01:57:25,958
every year I mean I you know I look at

2706
01:57:23,029 --> 01:57:30,889
it I look at it like this if you have

2707
01:57:25,958 --> 01:57:34,130
you know if you have 56 days in a cycle

2708
01:57:30,889 --> 01:57:36,349
if you're gonna pull down you know let's

2709
01:57:34,130 --> 01:57:37,939
say you're pulling down $30,000 every

2710
01:57:36,349 --> 01:57:43,130
every 56 days

2711
01:57:37,939 --> 01:57:46,369
well 56 days divided by $30,000 is you

2712
01:57:43,130 --> 01:57:47,929
know whatever it is I cannot but but for

2713
01:57:46,368 --> 01:57:50,328
every day that you're down and you're

2714
01:57:47,929 --> 01:57:52,550
not up and running you know you you

2715
01:57:50,328 --> 01:57:54,590
could consider that a loss whereas if

2716
01:57:52,550 --> 01:57:57,458
you're if you're really efficient you

2717
01:57:54,590 --> 01:58:00,139
really stay on your on your cycle I mean

2718
01:57:57,458 --> 01:58:03,078
there's there's no reason to not get six

2719
01:58:00,139 --> 01:58:05,029
and when we're all looking at and all

2720
01:58:03,078 --> 01:58:06,799
these new regulations and taxes and

2721
01:58:05,029 --> 01:58:08,359
everything we have to be smart with our

2722
01:58:06,800 --> 01:58:11,979
money we have to be smart with our time

2723
01:58:08,359 --> 01:58:17,149
be efficient otherwise we're gonna get

2724
01:58:11,979 --> 01:58:18,590
kicked at it again and Jonathan to

2725
01:58:17,149 --> 01:58:20,839
answer your question you know I

2726
01:58:18,590 --> 01:58:24,439
absolutely feel like genetics is

2727
01:58:20,840 --> 01:58:27,199
paramount to running you know multiple

2728
01:58:24,439 --> 01:58:29,539
cycles you know really looking into what

2729
01:58:27,198 --> 01:58:32,118
works in a cold colder weather system

2730
01:58:29,538 --> 01:58:34,158
what works better in a damper cycle

2731
01:58:32,118 --> 01:58:35,899
because with greenhouses and you're

2732
01:58:34,158 --> 01:58:37,518
lowering your costs you know and you're

2733
01:58:35,899 --> 01:58:38,958
not putting up all those fans and

2734
01:58:37,519 --> 01:58:41,689
everything you really can work with your

2735
01:58:38,958 --> 01:58:44,389
genetics during the seasonal times and

2736
01:58:41,689 --> 01:58:47,090
you know the model of getting as many

2737
01:58:44,389 --> 01:58:48,469
out of a season I totally understand it

2738
01:58:47,090 --> 01:58:51,439
and it makes all the sense in the world

2739
01:58:48,469 --> 01:58:54,229
and there are some formats that you can

2740
01:58:51,439 --> 01:58:57,199
use to just take some time off you know

2741
01:58:54,229 --> 01:58:58,639
and get like really good seasons you

2742
01:58:57,198 --> 01:59:00,799
know throughout the year and then you

2743
01:58:58,639 --> 01:59:02,389
know utilize your crew and rejuvenate

2744
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:04,010
yourself a little bit like that but I

2745
01:59:02,389 --> 01:59:05,630
mean I'm not saying I hate it I'm not

2746
01:59:04,010 --> 01:59:07,219
we're not at all saying that as I think

2747
01:59:05,630 --> 01:59:08,989
you know to what you said yeah I think

2748
01:59:07,219 --> 01:59:11,779
josh is saying that those because we

2749
01:59:08,988 --> 01:59:13,609
have one a dongsang consulting with with

2750
01:59:11,779 --> 01:59:15,198
a lot of farms and we have really run

2751
01:59:13,609 --> 01:59:16,759
those numbers and people are really

2752
01:59:15,198 --> 01:59:18,498
trying to push you know the five cycles

2753
01:59:16,760 --> 01:59:20,479
and then when you start running the

2754
01:59:18,498 --> 01:59:22,698
numbers and the outtake and the heat or

2755
01:59:20,479 --> 01:59:25,189
maybe the air conditioning that it takes

2756
01:59:22,698 --> 01:59:27,018
to run those it's almost better well it

2757
01:59:25,189 --> 01:59:29,000
is it actually has been better for some

2758
01:59:27,019 --> 01:59:30,739
of them to take off one of those

2759
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:32,960
because they've just realized that their

2760
01:59:30,739 --> 01:59:34,699
output is a lot more than what they're

2761
01:59:32,960 --> 01:59:36,529
getting out of it and one other factor

2762
01:59:34,699 --> 01:59:38,029
and like different and like in the state

2763
01:59:36,529 --> 01:59:40,069
of Oregon it's just there's a huge over

2764
01:59:38,029 --> 01:59:42,259
for production so just utilizing your

2765
01:59:40,069 --> 01:59:44,449
time you know in a way that makes senses

2766
01:59:42,260 --> 01:59:45,800
is a big thing but I'd also be

2767
01:59:44,449 --> 01:59:47,510
interested to hear what people are doing

2768
01:59:45,800 --> 01:59:49,460
for their soils if they're testing their

2769
01:59:47,510 --> 01:59:51,140
soils are doing ways to find their

2770
01:59:49,460 --> 01:59:54,380
selves to keep their plants efficient

2771
01:59:51,140 --> 02:00:07,369
and their greenhouses efficient in their

2772
01:59:54,380 --> 02:00:09,800
dress anyone's soil test Thanks yes we

2773
02:00:07,369 --> 02:00:11,359
soil test it's probably one of the best

2774
02:00:09,800 --> 02:00:15,380
things we could have done for our farm

2775
02:00:11,359 --> 02:00:17,599
we worked the soil two years and we used

2776
02:00:15,380 --> 02:00:21,319
dirty business soil located in Arcata

2777
02:00:17,600 --> 02:00:23,240
California and it just the the knowledge

2778
02:00:21,319 --> 02:00:26,479
that came from us being on an alluvial

2779
02:00:23,239 --> 02:00:29,149
floodplain was incredible the the ground

2780
02:00:26,479 --> 02:00:30,919
is perfect and so when I hear you guys

2781
02:00:29,149 --> 02:00:33,619
talking about all of the bags or

2782
02:00:30,920 --> 02:00:36,670
whatever I think it's sufficient to

2783
02:00:33,619 --> 02:00:36,670
plant into the ground

2784
02:00:38,770 --> 02:00:43,130
Mika's not back yet so I guess I still

2785
02:00:41,090 --> 02:00:45,260
have the stage but while I'm here if

2786
02:00:43,130 --> 02:00:46,880
anyone would like to do a video with the

2787
02:00:45,260 --> 02:00:48,350
gross sisters we want to hang out with

2788
02:00:46,880 --> 02:00:50,840
you guys more I don't know how long the

2789
02:00:48,350 --> 02:00:52,429
church goes today but there's definitely

2790
02:00:50,840 --> 02:00:55,449
topics that I've been writing down and I

2791
02:00:52,429 --> 02:00:58,158
would love to pick your brains later

2792
02:00:55,448 --> 02:01:00,589
yeah I'm sure most people are available

2793
02:00:58,158 --> 02:01:02,809
one form or another and yeah I mean I

2794
02:01:00,590 --> 02:01:11,389
definitely would love to say hello when

2795
02:01:02,810 --> 02:01:13,310
I come up north on my next visit lots of

2796
02:01:11,389 --> 02:01:15,529
people up in Humble have guest quarters

2797
02:01:13,310 --> 02:01:18,190
because it's not the type of area you go

2798
02:01:15,529 --> 02:01:20,809
to back in the day and just you know

2799
02:01:18,189 --> 02:01:23,799
hotels weren't always easily accessible

2800
02:01:20,810 --> 02:01:26,119
unless you were in Arcata

2801
02:01:23,800 --> 02:01:30,860
Sam had another thing he wanted to share

2802
02:01:26,118 --> 02:01:33,529
about talking about humans but basically

2803
02:01:30,859 --> 02:01:37,729
what we found is that absolutely need

2804
02:01:33,529 --> 02:01:41,149
lots of illumines to produce biomass and

2805
02:01:37,729 --> 02:01:43,759
vegetation has flowered halfway or more

2806
02:01:41,149 --> 02:01:48,099
and pretty much all so it's going to do

2807
02:01:43,760 --> 02:01:50,900
then is fill out the flowers and maybe

2808
02:01:48,100 --> 02:01:54,469
add a lot of weight from resin and stuff

2809
02:01:50,899 --> 02:01:56,329
I found lower light levels I'm talking

2810
02:01:54,469 --> 02:01:59,090
about from the Sun or from artificial

2811
02:01:56,329 --> 02:02:02,479
lights actually produce superior product

2812
02:01:59,090 --> 02:02:04,850
also what I found is that the high

2813
02:02:02,479 --> 02:02:08,209
temperatures associated with flowering

2814
02:02:04,850 --> 02:02:10,369
really high temperatures it's not really

2815
02:02:08,210 --> 02:02:13,250
positive because it has a tendency to

2816
02:02:10,368 --> 02:02:15,529
vaporize terpenes right on the plant so

2817
02:02:13,250 --> 02:02:19,719
lower temperatures a little bit lower

2818
02:02:15,529 --> 02:02:22,550
lumens I found produced superior product

2819
02:02:19,719 --> 02:02:24,319
there you go yeah I mean that's one of

2820
02:02:22,550 --> 02:02:26,179
the reasons that we spend a lot of time

2821
02:02:24,319 --> 02:02:28,039
trying to lower plant temperatures

2822
02:02:26,179 --> 02:02:31,039
because lowering the air temperature is

2823
02:02:28,039 --> 02:02:33,319
a lot harder to do and so our work has

2824
02:02:31,039 --> 02:02:35,090
been you know in a hundred degree days

2825
02:02:33,319 --> 02:02:37,939
trying to get plant temperatures down

2826
02:02:35,090 --> 02:02:40,039
into the high 80s if possible and it

2827
02:02:37,939 --> 02:02:42,229
works and the soil temps stay down too

2828
02:02:40,039 --> 02:02:43,789
and so you know part of that is what

2829
02:02:42,229 --> 02:02:46,428
we're seeing we're at the higher terpene

2830
02:02:43,789 --> 02:02:48,198
production coming up because a lot of

2831
02:02:46,429 --> 02:02:50,270
these places like I said are really high

2832
02:02:48,198 --> 02:02:51,199
in the air temperature but luckily for

2833
02:02:50,270 --> 02:02:53,630
us plants

2834
02:02:51,199 --> 02:02:55,099
like people we sweat plant sweat so put

2835
02:02:53,630 --> 02:02:57,470
me in front of a fan I'm gonna cool down

2836
02:02:55,100 --> 02:02:58,880
and not sweat put a fan in front of a

2837
02:02:57,470 --> 02:03:01,130
plant and it's gonna avoid it from

2838
02:02:58,880 --> 02:03:04,190
sweating and they even start to cool it

2839
02:03:01,130 --> 02:03:05,690
down because it's evaporative itself and

2840
02:03:04,189 --> 02:03:08,479
so that's where I see a lot of the

2841
02:03:05,689 --> 02:03:11,419
terpene and even higher THC productions

2842
02:03:08,479 --> 02:03:13,939
is yes softer light like samozang cooler

2843
02:03:11,420 --> 02:03:16,579
especially leaf surface temperature over

2844
02:03:13,939 --> 02:03:18,769
time and what we saw at the soil class

2845
02:03:16,579 --> 02:03:21,710
or the the regenerative class I did up

2846
02:03:18,770 --> 02:03:24,680
noir seminar with dragonfly up in

2847
02:03:21,710 --> 02:03:26,899
Portland last week was a guy that during

2848
02:03:24,680 --> 02:03:28,579
one of the discussions talked about THC

2849
02:03:26,899 --> 02:03:30,859
because a lot of people in certain books

2850
02:03:28,579 --> 02:03:34,689
and things written about you know higher

2851
02:03:30,859 --> 02:03:37,399
THC s high associated with higher UV and

2852
02:03:34,689 --> 02:03:39,259
what we see is that greenhouse covers in

2853
02:03:37,399 --> 02:03:41,989
general and even with glass green you

2854
02:03:39,260 --> 02:03:43,970
know glass being a cover a UV s can be

2855
02:03:41,989 --> 02:03:45,710
blocked and that's why people end up

2856
02:03:43,970 --> 02:03:47,810
getting a lot of PM in their greenhouses

2857
02:03:45,710 --> 02:03:50,210
versus outdoor plants outdoor plants

2858
02:03:47,810 --> 02:03:52,190
won't get PM is easy but greenhouse does

2859
02:03:50,210 --> 02:03:54,680
and that has a lot to do with the UVB

2860
02:03:52,189 --> 02:03:56,869
and so if people try to associate higher

2861
02:03:54,680 --> 02:03:59,270
THC with UV I'm starting to see that

2862
02:03:56,869 --> 02:04:01,399
that's not necessarily true and what

2863
02:03:59,270 --> 02:04:03,530
brings it up also in that class or the

2864
02:04:01,399 --> 02:04:06,019
seminar was a guy was doing testing with

2865
02:04:03,529 --> 02:04:09,259
LED lights and there was an LED light he

2866
02:04:06,020 --> 02:04:11,030
said that put off a higher UVB and so it

2867
02:04:09,260 --> 02:04:13,310
encouraged a higher leaf surface

2868
02:04:11,029 --> 02:04:16,369
temperature and they actually lost two

2869
02:04:13,310 --> 02:04:19,820
percent THC through testing the lights

2870
02:04:16,369 --> 02:04:22,670
and having those UV bees tell him that

2871
02:04:19,819 --> 02:04:24,349
so it it kind of associates a lot with

2872
02:04:22,670 --> 02:04:26,989
the Sun and how we can soften the light

2873
02:04:24,350 --> 02:04:28,730
to encourage higher THC and terpene

2874
02:04:26,989 --> 02:04:30,859
profiles and these plants and it can be

2875
02:04:28,729 --> 02:04:32,629
done and going back to what Jonathan was

2876
02:04:30,859 --> 02:04:34,039
saying about picking the right genetics

2877
02:04:32,630 --> 02:04:36,050
and I don't know if this has to do with

2878
02:04:34,039 --> 02:04:38,269
you know shitty clones over the course

2879
02:04:36,050 --> 02:04:39,949
of time because I was in some massive

2880
02:04:38,270 --> 02:04:42,440
greenhouses down in Southern California

2881
02:04:39,949 --> 02:04:44,179
and there was an acre or two that had

2882
02:04:42,439 --> 02:04:45,949
just tons of different varieties and

2883
02:04:44,180 --> 02:04:47,900
when you walk through the greenhouse you

2884
02:04:45,949 --> 02:04:50,059
can clearly see that certain varieties

2885
02:04:47,899 --> 02:04:52,219
did really well versus the other

2886
02:04:50,060 --> 02:04:54,289
varieties so it was clear for me is like

2887
02:04:52,220 --> 02:04:56,900
why grow these if you can just grow

2888
02:04:54,289 --> 02:04:59,180
those and you know it solves the problem

2889
02:04:56,899 --> 02:05:00,739
for that area but then again maybe they

2890
02:04:59,180 --> 02:05:02,600
had shitty moms and the clowns were

2891
02:05:00,739 --> 02:05:04,760
shitty but it literally looked like it

2892
02:05:02,600 --> 02:05:06,739
had a lot to do with the selective

2893
02:05:04,760 --> 02:05:08,329
cultivars that they were trying to deal

2894
02:05:06,738 --> 02:05:10,549
with at that time in that particular

2895
02:05:08,329 --> 02:05:12,409
area because again people are getting

2896
02:05:10,550 --> 02:05:14,420
existing greenhouses now and so they

2897
02:05:12,409 --> 02:05:16,729
might not have all the options that we

2898
02:05:14,420 --> 02:05:18,440
talked about and so how can we work with

2899
02:05:16,729 --> 02:05:22,399
existing systems to make them work

2900
02:05:18,439 --> 02:05:24,409
smarter not harder and all you know I

2901
02:05:22,399 --> 02:05:26,779
was thinking that it's really important

2902
02:05:24,409 --> 02:05:28,849
for people to have a small area of their

2903
02:05:26,779 --> 02:05:30,949
farm or their greenhouse for reached

2904
02:05:28,850 --> 02:05:33,590
research and development you know

2905
02:05:30,949 --> 02:05:35,750
running numbers and and and looking at

2906
02:05:33,590 --> 02:05:37,340
how we need to save money running a

2907
02:05:35,750 --> 02:05:39,380
little area of research and development

2908
02:05:37,340 --> 02:05:41,390
for genetics is really becoming

2909
02:05:39,380 --> 02:05:45,109
absolutely imperative what works in your

2910
02:05:41,390 --> 02:05:47,030
area and what doesn't I totally agree

2911
02:05:45,109 --> 02:05:49,279
with that and shout out to bogside

2912
02:05:47,029 --> 02:05:51,229
botanicals in maine they've been running

2913
02:05:49,279 --> 02:05:53,479
a few greenhouses of ours and they do

2914
02:05:51,229 --> 02:05:55,639
what they called snow dips on their hash

2915
02:05:53,479 --> 02:05:57,500
tags and I know they've done a lot of

2916
02:05:55,640 --> 02:06:00,260
research with small hoops and even

2917
02:05:57,500 --> 02:06:04,189
garage tents and things that we'd heard

2918
02:06:00,260 --> 02:06:06,680
earlier from some panelists and so yeah

2919
02:06:04,189 --> 02:06:08,299
I mean you can do a lot in a short

2920
02:06:06,680 --> 02:06:10,970
amount of time if you just do a little

2921
02:06:08,300 --> 02:06:12,739
bit of testing and then you know

2922
02:06:10,970 --> 02:06:14,960
quantify that you can do it and then

2923
02:06:12,738 --> 02:06:16,789
make the leap and so like I said before

2924
02:06:14,960 --> 02:06:19,039
a lot of the greenhouses and the things

2925
02:06:16,789 --> 02:06:21,350
that we see a pretty cookie cutter from

2926
02:06:19,039 --> 02:06:23,060
state to state coast-to-coast it's just

2927
02:06:21,350 --> 02:06:25,700
having that flexibility to be able to

2928
02:06:23,060 --> 02:06:27,860
open or close these greenhouses to you

2929
02:06:25,699 --> 02:06:30,500
know turn them on or off basically for a

2930
02:06:27,859 --> 02:06:32,329
lack of better words and support

2931
02:06:30,500 --> 02:06:34,670
cannabis not fight mother nature to

2932
02:06:32,329 --> 02:06:36,529
support cannabis but truly support it

2933
02:06:34,670 --> 02:06:38,569
and always possible and if we do get a

2934
02:06:36,529 --> 02:06:40,340
fight mother nature because there's no

2935
02:06:38,569 --> 02:06:42,349
Sun and it's dark and it's freezing cold

2936
02:06:40,340 --> 02:06:44,539
outside of obviously we want to add heat

2937
02:06:42,350 --> 02:06:47,079
but you know we want to be practical in

2938
02:06:44,539 --> 02:06:50,960
all these aspects of how we apply these

2939
02:06:47,079 --> 02:06:53,960
systems and are you seeing people using

2940
02:06:50,960 --> 02:06:56,119
shade cloths and in the heat of the day

2941
02:06:53,960 --> 02:06:58,850
and like for two hours say or something

2942
02:06:56,119 --> 02:07:01,099
like that I do and I in some cases I see

2943
02:06:58,850 --> 02:07:03,410
people using them in inconsistent ways

2944
02:07:01,100 --> 02:07:05,960
or maybe not totally in the correct

2945
02:07:03,409 --> 02:07:07,819
manner there is a time there is a point

2946
02:07:05,960 --> 02:07:09,529
of no return you know you can pull such

2947
02:07:07,819 --> 02:07:11,149
a shade cloth where it's too late and

2948
02:07:09,529 --> 02:07:13,579
you're actually going to be retaining

2949
02:07:11,149 --> 02:07:15,559
energy rather than helping cool the the

2950
02:07:13,579 --> 02:07:17,479
the leaf surfaces and things like that

2951
02:07:15,560 --> 02:07:18,150
I've been working with a lot of the

2952
02:07:17,479 --> 02:07:20,069
shade

2953
02:07:18,149 --> 02:07:22,500
screener now they call climate screens

2954
02:07:20,069 --> 02:07:24,149
now because originally they were shade

2955
02:07:22,500 --> 02:07:26,250
screens and so the companies we work

2956
02:07:24,149 --> 02:07:29,129
with create a climate screen that can be

2957
02:07:26,250 --> 02:07:31,140
used in various capacities and different

2958
02:07:29,130 --> 02:07:33,329
you know there's a whole book of samples

2959
02:07:31,140 --> 02:07:34,710
that I have and so depending on where

2960
02:07:33,329 --> 02:07:37,649
you are and what you're doing you know

2961
02:07:34,710 --> 02:07:40,050
we can select the proper energy slash

2962
02:07:37,649 --> 02:07:41,609
shade curtain but you know again the

2963
02:07:40,050 --> 02:07:44,550
grower has to use all these things at

2964
02:07:41,609 --> 02:07:46,769
the right time and appropriately so that

2965
02:07:44,550 --> 02:07:48,449
these things work smarter for you not

2966
02:07:46,770 --> 02:07:50,820
harder basically and that's kind of the

2967
02:07:48,448 --> 02:07:56,869
name of the game you can easily take the

2968
02:07:50,819 --> 02:08:00,119
word green right out of green house I'm

2969
02:07:56,869 --> 02:08:02,099
was wondering if we if anyone wanted to

2970
02:08:00,119 --> 02:08:03,779
talk about like pests in the greenhouse

2971
02:08:02,100 --> 02:08:07,560
and stuff because we've utilized our

2972
02:08:03,779 --> 02:08:10,619
greenhouse to get rid of pests and has

2973
02:08:07,560 --> 02:08:12,840
anyone else use that and what do they do

2974
02:08:10,619 --> 02:08:15,359
for that because I think that's a really

2975
02:08:12,840 --> 02:08:17,880
big issue in growing these days is how

2976
02:08:15,359 --> 02:08:19,769
to you have a greenhouse or how to go

2977
02:08:17,880 --> 02:08:22,789
long-term with pests and pests and

2978
02:08:19,770 --> 02:08:22,790
fungal management

2979
02:08:23,029 --> 02:08:27,029
yeah JD why don't we hear from you a

2980
02:08:25,439 --> 02:08:28,859
little bit what do you have to deal with

2981
02:08:27,029 --> 02:08:30,719
since you enter all these events and all

2982
02:08:28,859 --> 02:08:32,880
the scrutinized testing that you've gone

2983
02:08:30,719 --> 02:08:36,179
through in California do you spray and

2984
02:08:32,880 --> 02:08:37,980
deal battle pests and things um we

2985
02:08:36,179 --> 02:08:42,719
spraying when we need to kind of as a

2986
02:08:37,979 --> 02:08:46,019
last resort I've used heat a lot I'll

2987
02:08:42,719 --> 02:08:47,520
turn off the vents and on the on the

2988
02:08:46,020 --> 02:08:49,469
sealed greenhouse and I could run the

2989
02:08:47,520 --> 02:08:51,840
heat up really hot and if I run it up

2990
02:08:49,469 --> 02:08:53,789
over maybe like a hundred and ten

2991
02:08:51,840 --> 02:08:57,539
hundred fifteen degrees it seems like

2992
02:08:53,789 --> 02:08:59,310
it'll like start eliminating all the lot

2993
02:08:57,539 --> 02:09:02,908
of the pathogens you know like I've got

2994
02:08:59,310 --> 02:09:05,039
rid of a lot of pests we here you know

2995
02:09:02,908 --> 02:09:07,408
in this area you know it'll be 110

2996
02:09:05,039 --> 02:09:10,439
degrees outside for three or four days

2997
02:09:07,408 --> 02:09:13,619
running and so if you use four or five

2998
02:09:10,439 --> 02:09:16,738
hours a day and let it spike up up into

2999
02:09:13,619 --> 02:09:19,500
the 120 I mean it we've had a really it

3000
02:09:16,738 --> 02:09:21,209
seems to purge everything I'm here like

3001
02:09:19,500 --> 02:09:23,130
a lot of commercial nurseries doing that

3002
02:09:21,210 --> 02:09:24,840
too is just like with some of their

3003
02:09:23,130 --> 02:09:26,940
indoor plants it's like a lot easier and

3004
02:09:24,840 --> 02:09:28,020
more efficient than spraying so that's

3005
02:09:26,939 --> 02:09:30,619
one of the things that the greenhouse

3006
02:09:28,020 --> 02:09:30,620
will help with

3007
02:09:30,988 --> 02:09:36,448
are you spray away I like to spray with

3008
02:09:34,198 --> 02:09:38,399
compost tea like doing foliar tease you

3009
02:09:36,448 --> 02:09:41,488
know and building up that like natural

3010
02:09:38,399 --> 02:09:44,788
barrier on the plants so that they have

3011
02:09:41,488 --> 02:09:46,738
the immunity to fight it off the idea is

3012
02:09:44,788 --> 02:09:48,300
to not have to get into a battle with

3013
02:09:46,738 --> 02:09:50,279
anything which is to try to keep it in

3014
02:09:48,300 --> 02:09:55,860
balance the most much as possible

3015
02:09:50,279 --> 02:09:57,719
I am also heating up the greenhouse I

3016
02:09:55,859 --> 02:09:59,279
agree with you it's awesome I'm we're

3017
02:09:57,719 --> 02:10:00,748
really finding we're doing a tremendous

3018
02:09:59,279 --> 02:10:04,670
amount of research right now on

3019
02:10:00,748 --> 02:10:08,519
pathogens of both fungal and also pests

3020
02:10:04,670 --> 02:10:11,849
and we're finding that that 123 degrees

3021
02:10:08,519 --> 02:10:13,829
at leak temperature not just 120 degrees

3022
02:10:11,849 --> 02:10:16,199
and what is like going on in the outside

3023
02:10:13,828 --> 02:10:18,929
you know really having a temperature

3024
02:10:16,198 --> 02:10:20,698
gauge is absolutely imperative being

3025
02:10:18,929 --> 02:10:24,179
inside of the greenhouses when you're

3026
02:10:20,698 --> 02:10:25,859
raising it to 120 and also absolutely

3027
02:10:24,179 --> 02:10:28,469
giving them just like when you go into

3028
02:10:25,859 --> 02:10:30,089
the sauna you bring all of your teas and

3029
02:10:28,469 --> 02:10:32,279
your water is with you you really have

3030
02:10:30,090 --> 02:10:34,739
to drench those soils and get a really

3031
02:10:32,279 --> 02:10:37,109
beautiful tea on there that's easy to

3032
02:10:34,738 --> 02:10:40,319
uptake maybe some nice natural plant

3033
02:10:37,109 --> 02:10:41,759
electrolytes and get it up to 120

3034
02:10:40,319 --> 02:10:44,849
degrees and we're noticing that

3035
02:10:41,760 --> 02:10:48,780
pathogens die at 120 degrees and a lot

3036
02:10:44,849 --> 02:10:51,659
of the a lot of the beneficials will

3037
02:10:48,779 --> 02:10:54,840
thrive and the plant thrives at 120

3038
02:10:51,658 --> 02:10:56,359
degrees and we are just so thankful you

3039
02:10:54,840 --> 02:10:58,409
know maybe over the last 10 years

3040
02:10:56,359 --> 02:11:00,538
realizing about pest and fungal

3041
02:10:58,408 --> 02:11:02,518
management the leaves really going up

3042
02:11:00,538 --> 02:11:04,198
and stuff and then we hit a threshold or

3043
02:11:02,519 --> 02:11:06,059
they started to peel a little bit like

3044
02:11:04,198 --> 02:11:07,469
it a little bit too hot so we open the

3045
02:11:06,059 --> 02:11:08,998
sides but you have to be really careful

3046
02:11:07,469 --> 02:11:11,099
with the opening in the sides when you

3047
02:11:08,998 --> 02:11:13,109
do a heat treatment because if a wind

3048
02:11:11,099 --> 02:11:15,420
hits it or a direct Sun it can almost

3049
02:11:13,109 --> 02:11:17,458
like burn the leaves it makes us are you

3050
02:11:15,420 --> 02:11:18,929
really sure just that high when you heat

3051
02:11:17,458 --> 02:11:20,819
your greenhouse up you really have to

3052
02:11:18,929 --> 02:11:22,800
kind of open it slow and just let them

3053
02:11:20,819 --> 02:11:24,958
just kind of react limit and rebreathe

3054
02:11:22,800 --> 02:11:26,909
and stuff but I just want to say a fins

3055
02:11:24,958 --> 02:11:29,939
are a new pest that are becoming a

3056
02:11:26,908 --> 02:11:32,788
really big deal and there's kind of like

3057
02:11:29,939 --> 02:11:38,238
they're kind of different and they went

3058
02:11:32,788 --> 02:11:38,238
away after many hours of super hot heat

3059
02:11:44,519 --> 02:11:48,519
you guys ever see the ants bring the

3060
02:11:46,929 --> 02:11:50,458
aphids on to your plants so they could

3061
02:11:48,519 --> 02:11:53,860
milk them for their little sugary juices

3062
02:11:50,458 --> 02:11:56,109
yeah definitely it's really interesting

3063
02:11:53,859 --> 02:11:58,179
you know if you look at you know we've

3064
02:11:56,109 --> 02:12:00,038
gone into the brain of the 8th did this

3065
02:11:58,179 --> 02:12:02,739
last year have really taken a lot of

3066
02:12:00,038 --> 02:12:05,109
time to learn about Athens and what they

3067
02:12:02,738 --> 02:12:07,089
do and and what is happening now on the

3068
02:12:05,109 --> 02:12:10,958
planet and if you really look at an

3069
02:12:07,090 --> 02:12:14,860
aphid it's an amazing macro food for

3070
02:12:10,958 --> 02:12:17,139
almost every single other species this

3071
02:12:14,859 --> 02:12:18,819
little body it is so scrumptious it has

3072
02:12:17,139 --> 02:12:20,590
delicious little sugars and

3073
02:12:18,819 --> 02:12:22,149
carbohydrates in there you know and I

3074
02:12:20,590 --> 02:12:23,800
even ate one I was like okay you know

3075
02:12:22,149 --> 02:12:26,288
I'm really gonna do this they're

3076
02:12:23,800 --> 02:12:30,550
delicious they taste just like cannabis

3077
02:12:26,288 --> 02:12:36,009
juice so we're realizing that there's a

3078
02:12:30,550 --> 02:12:38,349
homeopathic dose don't know but they're

3079
02:12:36,010 --> 02:12:41,139
really delicious so they really make an

3080
02:12:38,349 --> 02:12:42,880
amazing food for other animals and other

3081
02:12:41,139 --> 02:12:45,189
life-forms and maybe they're coming in a

3082
02:12:42,880 --> 02:12:46,840
logical reason Yellowjackets eat them

3083
02:12:45,189 --> 02:12:48,280
and stuff so yeah you know it's

3084
02:12:46,840 --> 02:12:49,929
important broad mites you know we just

3085
02:12:48,279 --> 02:12:52,569
want to really encourage predator might

3086
02:12:49,929 --> 02:12:54,699
from the nursery all the way through

3087
02:12:52,569 --> 02:12:57,188
because you know sprays are harder and

3088
02:12:54,698 --> 02:12:59,379
harder to use even compost sprays and

3089
02:12:57,189 --> 02:13:00,519
120 degrees definitely will kill your

3090
02:12:59,380 --> 02:13:02,199
predators as well

3091
02:13:00,519 --> 02:13:04,570
your predator mites will not kill

3092
02:13:02,198 --> 02:13:07,598
ladybugs they love it other you know

3093
02:13:04,569 --> 02:13:09,488
hard exoskeleton creatures have no

3094
02:13:07,599 --> 02:13:12,400
problem with that much of the heat but

3095
02:13:09,488 --> 02:13:14,348
the small mites definitely die that's

3096
02:13:12,399 --> 02:13:17,069
interesting about ice is there something

3097
02:13:14,349 --> 02:13:17,069
to say about that

3098
02:13:18,569 --> 02:13:25,619
I was just commenting that using ice

3099
02:13:21,689 --> 02:13:27,239
water sprays on the plants will you know

3100
02:13:25,619 --> 02:13:29,340
cuz you'll see you'll notice mics and

3101
02:13:27,239 --> 02:13:31,859
russets and Rob mites all that stuff as

3102
02:13:29,340 --> 02:13:33,930
they take off they really thrive with

3103
02:13:31,859 --> 02:13:35,789
those higher temperatures so especially

3104
02:13:33,930 --> 02:13:36,990
with outdoor growing and you know you've

3105
02:13:35,789 --> 02:13:39,210
been to people's greenhouses you'll see

3106
02:13:36,989 --> 02:13:40,979
that so start to spread but ice water

3107
02:13:39,210 --> 02:13:42,300
will slow the cycle down for like two or

3108
02:13:40,979 --> 02:13:44,609
three you know instead of it being like

3109
02:13:42,300 --> 02:13:47,400
a duplication every like three days or

3110
02:13:44,609 --> 02:13:50,460
you can stretch that out to like four or

3111
02:13:47,399 --> 02:13:52,259
five and really slow down their their

3112
02:13:50,460 --> 02:13:55,350
duplication to give you time to get back

3113
02:13:52,260 --> 02:13:58,199
on top of it bubbleman I had a question

3114
02:13:55,350 --> 02:13:59,789
for you I started out just kind of as a

3115
02:13:58,199 --> 02:14:03,720
joke right here on the side but have you

3116
02:13:59,789 --> 02:14:06,630
ever worked with the the water from your

3117
02:14:03,720 --> 02:14:08,970
bubble hash and sprayed without on your

3118
02:14:06,630 --> 02:14:10,289
plants or if you used that to water into

3119
02:14:08,970 --> 02:14:14,690
your plants and have you seen anything

3120
02:14:10,289 --> 02:14:18,899
from that he may have just actually

3121
02:14:14,689 --> 02:14:21,149
loved shits I can see so that would be

3122
02:14:18,899 --> 02:14:22,829
interesting I mean I wonder a skunk man

3123
02:14:21,149 --> 02:14:25,829
Sam had anything to say about that too

3124
02:14:22,829 --> 02:14:27,960
but we use our ice water hash for every

3125
02:14:25,829 --> 02:14:30,210
single feeding you know we actually are

3126
02:14:27,960 --> 02:14:33,090
realizing that we're making hash now or

3127
02:14:30,210 --> 02:14:35,699
more for the nutrients of our plants and

3128
02:14:33,090 --> 02:14:38,159
to get like the leftover material into

3129
02:14:35,699 --> 02:14:40,079
our soil yeah even the hash I mean the

3130
02:14:38,159 --> 02:14:41,909
hash is now a secondary product for us

3131
02:14:40,079 --> 02:14:43,829
we're putting together our nursery soil

3132
02:14:41,909 --> 02:14:45,809
right now so we want to spin some hash

3133
02:14:43,829 --> 02:14:48,569
up so that we can utilize the leaf and

3134
02:14:45,810 --> 02:14:51,660
our soil mix and then we have a hundred

3135
02:14:48,569 --> 02:14:54,299
and fifty gallon tank that has a hose

3136
02:14:51,659 --> 02:14:57,329
coming out of it so all the water comes

3137
02:14:54,300 --> 02:14:59,100
out of the mingoes into 150 gallon tank

3138
02:14:57,329 --> 02:15:01,019
and then grab we gravity feed all that

3139
02:14:59,100 --> 02:15:03,450
water into our different greenhouses so

3140
02:15:01,020 --> 02:15:07,260
we just accumulate the terpene water in

3141
02:15:03,449 --> 02:15:08,760
our beds and I love it's a great idea of

3142
02:15:07,260 --> 02:15:10,949
course if you're making ice water hash

3143
02:15:08,760 --> 02:15:13,199
it's not so great to do ice water hash

3144
02:15:10,949 --> 02:15:15,269
necessarily in the middle of summer but

3145
02:15:13,199 --> 02:15:16,619
if you are spinning something inside and

3146
02:15:15,270 --> 02:15:18,870
you can spray a truss it might

3147
02:15:16,619 --> 02:15:23,729
definitely do not like that cold water I

3148
02:15:18,869 --> 02:15:26,579
love that idea Jonathan mm-hmm just just

3149
02:15:23,729 --> 02:15:30,179
as another sort of cut with greenhouses

3150
02:15:26,579 --> 02:15:32,369
and pest control just keeping things

3151
02:15:30,180 --> 02:15:34,590
kind of cold in the winter you know

3152
02:15:32,369 --> 02:15:36,119
there's any sort of issues you see

3153
02:15:34,590 --> 02:15:39,050
anything you know just turning the

3154
02:15:36,119 --> 02:15:41,760
heater off and letting things kind of

3155
02:15:39,050 --> 02:15:44,039
get a little bit colder than normal at

3156
02:15:41,760 --> 02:15:47,100
least in bed I'm talking about more so

3157
02:15:44,039 --> 02:15:48,779
but and then it just gives you kind of a

3158
02:15:47,100 --> 02:15:52,470
chance to get really on top of things

3159
02:15:48,779 --> 02:15:54,989
and they just don't bug just don't

3160
02:15:52,470 --> 02:15:57,780
multiplies readily when it's a little

3161
02:15:54,989 --> 02:16:00,179
bit chillier you know yeah it's another

3162
02:15:57,779 --> 02:16:01,859
reason that we like promote the radiant

3163
02:16:00,180 --> 02:16:03,720
heating because when you heat the soil

3164
02:16:01,859 --> 02:16:06,269
and heat the roots and heat the plant

3165
02:16:03,720 --> 02:16:08,130
itself the air temp can stay kind of

3166
02:16:06,270 --> 02:16:11,130
lower and you experienced that with your

3167
02:16:08,130 --> 02:16:14,400
geothermal your prohibition vault is

3168
02:16:11,130 --> 02:16:17,960
actually your geothermal heating system

3169
02:16:14,399 --> 02:16:20,699
for your greenhouse inadvertently and

3170
02:16:17,960 --> 02:16:22,890
you're able to keep those air temps down

3171
02:16:20,699 --> 02:16:25,590
so I mean that's really a benefit in the

3172
02:16:22,890 --> 02:16:28,710
in the in the wintertime too so I mean

3173
02:16:25,590 --> 02:16:32,069
yeah using using the environment to do

3174
02:16:28,710 --> 02:16:34,260
things to mitigate bugs is definitely a

3175
02:16:32,069 --> 02:16:36,779
good way to make the green green in the

3176
02:16:34,260 --> 02:16:38,489
greenhouse you know bubbleman you

3177
02:16:36,780 --> 02:16:41,989
dropped off for a second there but I

3178
02:16:38,489 --> 02:16:44,968
wanted to ask you have you utilize the

3179
02:16:41,989 --> 02:16:46,619
spent water from making bubble with all

3180
02:16:44,968 --> 02:16:49,289
of the Terps and all of the everything

3181
02:16:46,620 --> 02:16:54,000
that's inside of that to use as an

3182
02:16:49,290 --> 02:16:55,920
effective foliar or drench we definitely

3183
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:57,569
played around in the early days but

3184
02:16:55,920 --> 02:17:00,950
never really noticed anything you know

3185
02:16:57,569 --> 02:17:04,199
I've my experiments were more hash

3186
02:17:00,950 --> 02:17:05,250
focused then grow focused and I always

3187
02:17:04,200 --> 02:17:07,020
seem to be lucky

3188
02:17:05,250 --> 02:17:08,760
you know shout out to Ron Hickey my grow

3189
02:17:07,020 --> 02:17:11,099
mentor from back in the day who just

3190
02:17:08,760 --> 02:17:13,469
always made it seem like a simple thing

3191
02:17:11,099 --> 02:17:16,020
to produce pull melt resin so I never

3192
02:17:13,468 --> 02:17:18,149
grew on a huge huge scale you know 20

3193
02:17:16,020 --> 02:17:20,099
lights was about where I maxed out and I

3194
02:17:18,149 --> 02:17:21,750
mostly really did indoor with a little

3195
02:17:20,099 --> 02:17:24,090
bit of outdoor sort of on my deck and

3196
02:17:21,750 --> 02:17:25,888
whatnot still do have the dream of

3197
02:17:24,090 --> 02:17:28,409
getting the forever flowering green

3198
02:17:25,888 --> 02:17:31,109
house behind my house that'll be 2018 or

3199
02:17:28,409 --> 02:17:32,789
2019 for certain but not too much

3200
02:17:31,110 --> 02:17:34,409
experiments other than you know a little

3201
02:17:32,790 --> 02:17:36,300
bit of a foliar feed and putting it

3202
02:17:34,409 --> 02:17:37,888
right back into the plants and it

3203
02:17:36,299 --> 02:17:40,259
definitely doesn't seem to do- that's

3204
02:17:37,888 --> 02:17:43,339
for sure what are you guys smoking on

3205
02:17:40,260 --> 02:17:43,340
over there in Jamaica

3206
02:17:44,389 --> 02:17:54,779
I'm hitting some pure artesian rosin

3207
02:17:47,850 --> 02:17:56,760
from Quebec little Quebec rosin a Mac

3208
02:17:54,780 --> 02:17:59,909
and of course we're hitting some local

3209
02:17:56,760 --> 02:18:01,500
Jamaican flavors as well rosin I've

3210
02:17:59,909 --> 02:18:03,659
always come and made bubble hash over

3211
02:18:01,500 --> 02:18:05,280
the years but rosin is just such a quick

3212
02:18:03,659 --> 02:18:07,829
and easy thing especially when you have

3213
02:18:05,280 --> 02:18:10,440
the Sasquatch rosin press here in

3214
02:18:07,829 --> 02:18:12,450
Jamaica we can just crush out a half

3215
02:18:10,440 --> 02:18:14,579
found in no time and make some some nice

3216
02:18:12,450 --> 02:18:16,530
resin so we have some you know the the

3217
02:18:14,579 --> 02:18:18,959
pineapple skunk or whatever they call it

3218
02:18:16,530 --> 02:18:22,739
the classic everything skunk in Jamaica

3219
02:18:18,959 --> 02:18:25,759
that's so awesome what are you smoking

3220
02:18:22,739 --> 02:18:25,760
on dragonfly

3221
02:18:27,139 --> 02:18:33,050
we have this homesteader strain that

3222
02:18:31,010 --> 02:18:34,819
we've crossed our temple spiced with our

3223
02:18:33,050 --> 02:18:38,119
zelli's gift and it's just got this

3224
02:18:34,819 --> 02:18:42,770
really beautiful flavor to it that has

3225
02:18:38,120 --> 02:18:44,810
some of the Jack Herer super Lemon Haze

3226
02:18:42,770 --> 02:18:48,140
Matthew's some of that original laughs

3227
02:18:44,809 --> 02:18:49,969
goo it comes from a father of our f who

3228
02:18:48,139 --> 02:18:51,199
knows how many years many many many

3229
02:18:49,969 --> 02:18:53,149
years that we've been working with a

3230
02:18:51,200 --> 02:18:54,440
particular strain and we've got this one

3231
02:18:53,149 --> 02:18:56,420
that we're calling the homesteader

3232
02:18:54,440 --> 02:18:58,190
because it's so sweet and because we

3233
02:18:56,420 --> 02:19:00,469
used our hash water on it that's on our

3234
02:18:58,190 --> 02:19:02,390
homestead but you know the I just want

3235
02:19:00,469 --> 02:19:04,519
to say one thing is just that when we do

3236
02:19:02,389 --> 02:19:06,590
use our hash water on that water it

3237
02:19:04,520 --> 02:19:08,540
doesn't really last very long and also

3238
02:19:06,591 --> 02:19:10,790
the leaf doesn't last very long when it

3239
02:19:08,540 --> 02:19:13,310
gets pinned up stephane up because I

3240
02:19:10,790 --> 02:19:16,310
don't know spinned is a word but I spun

3241
02:19:13,309 --> 02:19:18,529
up it tends to have a little bit of a

3242
02:19:16,309 --> 02:19:20,569
you know the ability to break down quick

3243
02:19:18,530 --> 02:19:23,600
so you know we put it right into our

3244
02:19:20,569 --> 02:19:24,889
soil in fact our son and our family's up

3245
02:19:23,600 --> 02:19:28,010
at home right now doing that right now

3246
02:19:24,889 --> 02:19:30,619
shout out to the crew thanks guys Matt

3247
02:19:28,010 --> 02:19:31,969
yeah so we're putting it right into the

3248
02:19:30,620 --> 02:19:33,950
soil so that it doesn't create a

3249
02:19:31,969 --> 02:19:35,449
breakdown and it doesn't get anaerobic

3250
02:19:33,950 --> 02:19:37,010
because the water on the leaf you know

3251
02:19:35,450 --> 02:19:40,520
can create an anaerobic thing will make

3252
02:19:37,010 --> 02:19:42,110
Bokashi and it by adding dry material to

3253
02:19:40,520 --> 02:19:44,510
it to make sure that it doesn't get too

3254
02:19:42,110 --> 02:19:46,610
wet and stuff so anyway utilizing it

3255
02:19:44,510 --> 02:19:48,409
fresh is key in the water you know just

3256
02:19:46,610 --> 02:19:51,021
accumulates in the soil nicely but

3257
02:19:48,409 --> 02:19:53,390
anyway that's cool what are you smoking

3258
02:19:51,021 --> 02:19:58,061
on farmer Tom what's your what's your

3259
02:19:53,390 --> 02:19:58,060
go-to in the throughout the day

3260
02:20:01,909 --> 02:20:03,969
you

3261
02:20:05,780 --> 02:20:14,720
muted you're muted who I muted no it's

3262
02:20:12,290 --> 02:20:16,460
Tom is that not had been not able to

3263
02:20:14,719 --> 02:20:18,679
tell there there we go

3264
02:20:16,459 --> 02:20:22,399
okay we're smoking I'm smoking black

3265
02:20:18,680 --> 02:20:25,340
wreck which is a black Durban mixed with

3266
02:20:22,399 --> 02:20:28,489
train wreck and mix with some amnesia

3267
02:20:25,340 --> 02:20:31,399
haze so that's we're like in here

3268
02:20:28,489 --> 02:20:38,030
that sounds good right on what about you

3269
02:20:31,399 --> 02:20:43,250
Sean what are you smoking on og simply

3270
02:20:38,030 --> 02:20:48,739
simply og okay that sounds good what

3271
02:20:43,250 --> 02:20:50,299
about you JD let's see it

3272
02:20:48,739 --> 02:20:51,860
a little rolled up for the show I've got

3273
02:20:50,299 --> 02:20:53,449
a living banana sherbert and just came

3274
02:20:51,860 --> 02:20:57,200
out of our winter round just came out

3275
02:20:53,450 --> 02:20:58,851
really nice super sweet and creamy good

3276
02:20:57,200 --> 02:21:04,040
thing track and still stay focused on

3277
02:20:58,851 --> 02:21:07,909
the show not good two glasses or that

3278
02:21:04,040 --> 02:21:09,170
sounds good since you're in the area ha

3279
02:21:07,909 --> 02:21:11,239
ha ha

3280
02:21:09,170 --> 02:21:13,129
when I was at the golden tarp I was

3281
02:21:11,239 --> 02:21:16,549
lucky enough to do this um judging and

3282
02:21:13,129 --> 02:21:18,289
whatnot and I mean I was able to know

3283
02:21:16,549 --> 02:21:19,699
which flower was yours once they

3284
02:21:18,290 --> 02:21:22,130
announced the winners because they let

3285
02:21:19,700 --> 02:21:24,230
us know the number but it was definitely

3286
02:21:22,129 --> 02:21:26,750
I think a landslide at the judges area

3287
02:21:24,229 --> 02:21:29,869
it was clear like it was pretty easy to

3288
02:21:26,750 --> 02:21:31,370
choose your flower over some of the rest

3289
02:21:29,870 --> 02:21:32,681
I think a lot of people in those light

3290
02:21:31,370 --> 02:21:34,780
dip competitions

3291
02:21:32,681 --> 02:21:37,760
unfortunately enter a lot of premature

3292
02:21:34,780 --> 02:21:39,829
herb is what I saw I saw a lot more

3293
02:21:37,760 --> 02:21:40,250
premature weed than I normally used to

3294
02:21:39,829 --> 02:21:42,709
seeing

3295
02:21:40,250 --> 02:21:51,351
well Jason what are you smoking on over

3296
02:21:42,709 --> 02:21:57,770
there um my favorite is uh this cherry

3297
02:21:51,351 --> 02:22:00,340
pie dough got going but um so a couple

3298
02:21:57,771 --> 02:22:05,239
of cuts I got from some friends just

3299
02:22:00,340 --> 02:22:07,280
nice donkey beautiful love it let's kill

3300
02:22:05,239 --> 02:22:11,239
her what about you Jonathan

3301
02:22:07,280 --> 02:22:17,120
you smoke on anything over there super

3302
02:22:11,239 --> 02:22:19,340
Silver Haze all the time you know me you

3303
02:22:17,120 --> 02:22:30,561
don't have any LSD going on over there

3304
02:22:19,340 --> 02:22:32,601
cuz I was good for a while what about my

3305
02:22:30,560 --> 02:22:35,239
kid what do you got in Colorado there

3306
02:22:32,601 --> 02:22:38,510
the strain of course you know write the

3307
02:22:35,239 --> 02:22:42,739
strain LSD Jonathan come on man your

3308
02:22:38,510 --> 02:22:45,560
mind you're on pains in Colorado with

3309
02:22:42,739 --> 02:22:48,440
Flav is that a leaflet yeah it is it's a

3310
02:22:45,560 --> 02:22:52,670
CBD strain that we did Valentine acts

3311
02:22:48,440 --> 02:22:56,390
and this is what I managed to get my bag

3312
02:22:52,670 --> 02:23:00,890
before we took off so let's kill her

3313
02:22:56,390 --> 02:23:02,689
that make slopes much nicer Ron well uh

3314
02:23:00,890 --> 02:23:06,228
I'd like to bring

3315
02:23:02,689 --> 02:23:08,840
back to greenhouse cultivation if I can

3316
02:23:06,228 --> 02:23:10,728
for a second I got a couple questions

3317
02:23:08,840 --> 02:23:14,328
I'd like to just throw out to the group

3318
02:23:10,728 --> 02:23:16,278
you know because I think a lot of a lot

3319
02:23:14,328 --> 02:23:18,648
of methodologies of cultivation are

3320
02:23:16,279 --> 02:23:21,078
changing right now because of the

3321
02:23:18,648 --> 02:23:23,778
removal of the plant count right because

3322
02:23:21,078 --> 02:23:25,639
that ruled so much of what people were

3323
02:23:23,779 --> 02:23:28,760
doing for so long and people didn't want

3324
02:23:25,639 --> 02:23:30,769
to get above 99 plants on their property

3325
02:23:28,760 --> 02:23:33,139
but now that we remove that a lot of

3326
02:23:30,770 --> 02:23:35,899
people are going with smaller plants and

3327
02:23:33,139 --> 02:23:38,538
higher plant counts so you know when we

3328
02:23:35,898 --> 02:23:40,248
talk about efficiency and of course you

3329
02:23:38,539 --> 02:23:41,630
know there's so many ways to look at it

3330
02:23:40,248 --> 02:23:44,510
really you know a lot of people are just

3331
02:23:41,629 --> 02:23:48,469
focused on efficiency which have a lot

3332
02:23:44,510 --> 02:23:53,270
of you know you know it's very practical

3333
02:23:48,469 --> 02:23:55,278
in the regulated market and you know Sam

3334
02:23:53,270 --> 02:23:58,998
was talking about growing big plants

3335
02:23:55,279 --> 02:24:03,350
more for you know genetics and breeding

3336
02:23:58,998 --> 02:24:05,510
and such and so what I'm seeing too is a

3337
02:24:03,350 --> 02:24:07,670
you know a big movement into rolling

3338
02:24:05,510 --> 02:24:10,969
benches so that you can really utilize

3339
02:24:07,670 --> 02:24:13,609
your footprint and have as much of your

3340
02:24:10,969 --> 02:24:17,148
space being grown with this little

3341
02:24:13,609 --> 02:24:18,470
amount of walkways going on and so some

3342
02:24:17,148 --> 02:24:20,809
people are going with really small

3343
02:24:18,469 --> 02:24:23,658
plants like 5 to 7 gallon plants and

3344
02:24:20,809 --> 02:24:26,420
then just able to just grow really short

3345
02:24:23,658 --> 02:24:29,868
plants that are about you know 18 inches

3346
02:24:26,420 --> 02:24:32,600
2 feet tops you know at the end with a

3347
02:24:29,869 --> 02:24:34,850
whole lot less labor that goes into it a

3348
02:24:32,600 --> 02:24:36,470
whole lot less amount of time for you

3349
02:24:34,850 --> 02:24:39,619
know again any molds milites pasture

3350
02:24:36,469 --> 02:24:42,379
diseases to move in and so you know

3351
02:24:39,619 --> 02:24:45,619
wondering what everybody here on the

3352
02:24:42,379 --> 02:24:48,858
call is having success with in the sense

3353
02:24:45,619 --> 02:24:51,260
of are you moving to higher plant count

3354
02:24:48,859 --> 02:24:54,408
smaller plants are you growing larger

3355
02:24:51,260 --> 02:24:56,209
plants inside of a greenhouse and and

3356
02:24:54,408 --> 02:24:57,799
going in that direction and maybe

3357
02:24:56,209 --> 02:25:00,289
vegging them somewhere else and getting

3358
02:24:57,799 --> 02:25:03,219
them in yeah what's your guys's

3359
02:25:00,289 --> 02:25:03,220
experience out there

3360
02:25:06,079 --> 02:25:11,060
doing higher play higher plank counts

3361
02:25:08,690 --> 02:25:12,190
than we were in the past we're sure now

3362
02:25:11,060 --> 02:25:17,869
that we don't really have to worry about

3363
02:25:12,190 --> 02:25:19,360
the quote unquote 99 rule for a handful

3364
02:25:17,870 --> 02:25:21,771
of different reasons I think that

3365
02:25:19,360 --> 02:25:23,180
especially with their full term stuff so

3366
02:25:21,771 --> 02:25:24,980
we do you know we've got some gardens

3367
02:25:23,180 --> 02:25:28,909
out to the sides of the greenhouses and

3368
02:25:24,979 --> 02:25:30,439
you know tending to a you know 16 foot

3369
02:25:28,909 --> 02:25:32,420
tall

3370
02:25:30,440 --> 02:25:35,810
outdoor plant it's super labor-intensive

3371
02:25:32,420 --> 02:25:38,540
and so we're trying to keep everything

3372
02:25:35,810 --> 02:25:40,399
that's just same height as us it's a lot

3373
02:25:38,540 --> 02:25:43,460
easier we do more more plants than a

3374
02:25:40,399 --> 02:25:48,469
nice let's watch let's watch you hit

3375
02:25:43,459 --> 02:25:50,509
that thing we do more plants in the

3376
02:25:48,469 --> 02:25:52,609
garden and we did in the past and it's

3377
02:25:50,510 --> 02:25:54,500
mainly great law for two different

3378
02:25:52,610 --> 02:25:56,300
reasons the one thing being that it's

3379
02:25:54,500 --> 02:25:59,060
easier when it comes to labor I think

3380
02:25:56,299 --> 02:26:00,739
and then the other is just I personally

3381
02:25:59,060 --> 02:26:04,279
feel that younger plants when you have

3382
02:26:00,739 --> 02:26:07,459
these big gigantic tall plants we kind

3383
02:26:04,280 --> 02:26:09,021
of see that there's we run into more

3384
02:26:07,459 --> 02:26:10,459
problems with molds and stuff at the end

3385
02:26:09,021 --> 02:26:13,400
of the year than we do with smaller

3386
02:26:10,459 --> 02:26:15,799
plants that aren't so thick and you know

3387
02:26:13,399 --> 02:26:17,359
in the bud setting so that's the main

3388
02:26:15,799 --> 02:26:21,459
thing and then in our depots yeah we

3389
02:26:17,360 --> 02:26:24,050
definitely don't see a green still doing

3390
02:26:21,459 --> 02:26:26,599
we're doing beds and all of our depots

3391
02:26:24,049 --> 02:26:28,909
even in our overflowing greenhouses it's

3392
02:26:26,600 --> 02:26:30,860
just the way it's my personal I like I

3393
02:26:28,909 --> 02:26:32,989
don't like moving a bunch of pots around

3394
02:26:30,860 --> 02:26:35,480
and pulling soil in and out of that

3395
02:26:32,989 --> 02:26:37,579
greenhouse all the time that might

3396
02:26:35,479 --> 02:26:40,789
change as we expand if we do do one of

3397
02:26:37,579 --> 02:26:42,950
these big greenhouse facilities I might

3398
02:26:40,790 --> 02:26:46,220
you know change my thinking on that just

3399
02:26:42,950 --> 02:26:47,900
being about we'll see yeah so more plant

3400
02:26:46,219 --> 02:26:50,239
more more plants and smaller plants

3401
02:26:47,899 --> 02:26:52,270
that's definitely what we're doing Mike

3402
02:26:50,239 --> 02:26:54,319
it's cool you just touched on something

3403
02:26:52,271 --> 02:26:57,021
that's interesting you know I was

3404
02:26:54,319 --> 02:26:58,819
talking about earlier R&amp;D and you know

3405
02:26:57,021 --> 02:27:00,860
bigger plants do have more

3406
02:26:58,819 --> 02:27:02,869
susceptibility we're definitely noticing

3407
02:27:00,860 --> 02:27:04,430
that is really awesome to grow them out

3408
02:27:02,870 --> 02:27:06,920
because they are these beautiful amazing

3409
02:27:04,430 --> 02:27:10,100
sentient beings and who doesn't love to

3410
02:27:06,920 --> 02:27:12,530
grow big plants and we just for those

3411
02:27:10,100 --> 02:27:14,420
tall ones yeah and we use that for our

3412
02:27:12,530 --> 02:27:16,159
research and development so what grows

3413
02:27:14,420 --> 02:27:18,299
well around our areas we're going to

3414
02:27:16,159 --> 02:27:19,978
grow those plants all the way out and oh

3415
02:27:18,299 --> 02:27:22,259
/ and we're gonna find out how they're

3416
02:27:19,978 --> 02:27:24,510
doing in the environment - you know

3417
02:27:22,260 --> 02:27:26,100
really work with what plants we're gonna

3418
02:27:24,510 --> 02:27:28,648
run for the next year what we're gonna

3419
02:27:26,100 --> 02:27:30,659
see doubt so picking our genetics and

3420
02:27:28,648 --> 02:27:32,519
there is different expressions that come

3421
02:27:30,659 --> 02:27:34,439
from the bigger plans so I think that

3422
02:27:32,520 --> 02:27:36,659
you know for us we'll always keep a

3423
02:27:34,439 --> 02:27:39,000
greenhouse and you know for the big

3424
02:27:36,659 --> 02:27:41,100
plants and stuff I know that different

3425
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:44,129
regulations make people grow differently

3426
02:27:41,100 --> 02:27:46,140
in California you know it makes sense to

3427
02:27:44,129 --> 02:27:48,179
have 20 pounds at a time you know for

3428
02:27:46,139 --> 02:27:50,129
testing and everything and when it comes

3429
02:27:48,180 --> 02:27:52,889
to testing that's a cost and everything

3430
02:27:50,129 --> 02:27:56,789
so sometimes that's why clones are doing

3431
02:27:52,889 --> 02:27:59,068
batches of you know different you know

3432
02:27:56,790 --> 02:28:00,569
you know smaller plants and big batches

3433
02:27:59,068 --> 02:28:02,430
can make a lot of sense for testing and

3434
02:28:00,568 --> 02:28:03,629
stuff and what we're also doing now is

3435
02:28:02,430 --> 02:28:05,068
we're actually swapping out our

3436
02:28:03,629 --> 02:28:06,719
greenhouses so one half of the

3437
02:28:05,068 --> 02:28:08,670
greenhouse is for these huge large

3438
02:28:06,719 --> 02:28:10,920
plants that were utilizing research and

3439
02:28:08,670 --> 02:28:13,318
development in one area and then we're

3440
02:28:10,920 --> 02:28:15,270
doing you know two different cycles in

3441
02:28:13,318 --> 02:28:16,949
the other side of the greenhouse and a

3442
02:28:15,270 --> 02:28:23,220
sea of green so that's been really fun

3443
02:28:16,950 --> 02:28:26,100
to sort of swap it around going back to

3444
02:28:23,219 --> 02:28:28,709
pests having the smaller plants we were

3445
02:28:26,100 --> 02:28:30,689
able to handle them more and keep them

3446
02:28:28,709 --> 02:28:36,148
cleaner and moved through them quicker

3447
02:28:30,689 --> 02:28:38,668
and so the DEP worked anyway

3448
02:28:36,148 --> 02:28:40,288
I think that has a lot to do with the

3449
02:28:38,668 --> 02:28:42,388
plants just being in a more vigorous

3450
02:28:40,289 --> 02:28:44,248
state you know and especially if you're

3451
02:28:42,388 --> 02:28:46,078
in beds you know and if you have pots

3452
02:28:44,248 --> 02:28:48,929
you know if you if your plants have been

3453
02:28:46,078 --> 02:28:50,818
in pots for a long time and their roots

3454
02:28:48,929 --> 02:28:54,359
are bound you know they're gonna be more

3455
02:28:50,818 --> 02:28:55,978
susceptible towards towards pests and

3456
02:28:54,359 --> 02:28:58,649
and there's a lot of soil tests that can

3457
02:28:55,978 --> 02:29:01,138
prove that and bigger people need bigger

3458
02:28:58,648 --> 02:29:03,478
more calories it's no different for

3459
02:29:01,138 --> 02:29:05,068
plants you know when you have larger

3460
02:29:03,478 --> 02:29:06,418
people larger plants they need more

3461
02:29:05,068 --> 02:29:08,818
calories they're definitely going to be

3462
02:29:06,418 --> 02:29:11,998
up taking so much more from your soil as

3463
02:29:08,818 --> 02:29:13,769
well so it's really Jen rade out are

3464
02:29:11,998 --> 02:29:15,689
your plants producing more flowers in

3465
02:29:13,770 --> 02:29:18,328
the end or is the sea of green producing

3466
02:29:15,689 --> 02:29:19,859
more flowers and the flat that's the

3467
02:29:18,328 --> 02:29:21,779
smaller plants though usually those

3468
02:29:19,859 --> 02:29:24,270
roots are in a more vigorous growth

3469
02:29:21,779 --> 02:29:26,789
state as they're growing so they're

3470
02:29:24,270 --> 02:29:29,699
there put their flowers are more healthy

3471
02:29:26,789 --> 02:29:31,350
in that way Sam just had mentioned

3472
02:29:29,699 --> 02:29:33,299
something off camera here when we were

3473
02:29:31,350 --> 02:29:39,209
on mute that would you want to mention

3474
02:29:33,299 --> 02:29:43,759
it's am just wanted to mention that when

3475
02:29:39,209 --> 02:29:46,739
I grew the extent achill clone big small

3476
02:29:43,759 --> 02:29:49,709
even in vitro so that the flower Dolf

3477
02:29:46,738 --> 02:29:52,109
plant was only maybe an inch or two tall

3478
02:29:49,709 --> 02:29:55,709
when it was completely flowered in agar

3479
02:29:52,109 --> 02:29:58,168
agar in vitro in a test tube the resin

3480
02:29:55,709 --> 02:30:01,139
is much smaller the resin individual

3481
02:29:58,168 --> 02:30:03,568
resin heads on that plant when you grow

3482
02:30:01,138 --> 02:30:05,849
it to 3 feet tall like you're talking

3483
02:30:03,568 --> 02:30:09,478
about 4 C green or something the the

3484
02:30:05,850 --> 02:30:12,479
resin is is quite a big a bit bigger but

3485
02:30:09,478 --> 02:30:15,059
when I grew my same clone and it was 12

3486
02:30:12,478 --> 02:30:17,238
feet tall the resin was again a little

3487
02:30:15,059 --> 02:30:17,238
bit

3488
02:30:18,771 --> 02:30:23,961
that's important it's important to me we

3489
02:30:21,800 --> 02:30:26,469
we missed that last that last little

3490
02:30:23,960 --> 02:30:29,569
part but

3491
02:30:26,469 --> 02:30:32,709
well the the last little part was that

3492
02:30:29,569 --> 02:30:35,359
if your plant is 12 feet tall and you

3493
02:30:32,709 --> 02:30:37,759
flour it off and then you collect the

3494
02:30:35,359 --> 02:30:41,870
resin from that it's again a little bit

3495
02:30:37,760 --> 02:30:44,090
bigger than the 3 foot plant the each

3496
02:30:41,870 --> 02:30:45,859
individual resin head is a little bit

3497
02:30:44,090 --> 02:30:48,950
bigger and for hash makers that's

3498
02:30:45,859 --> 02:30:50,870
important and that's where we you know

3499
02:30:48,950 --> 02:30:52,850
don't want to outsmart ourselves you

3500
02:30:50,870 --> 02:30:54,680
know and and and having a place for the

3501
02:30:52,850 --> 02:30:55,700
bigger plants and the bigger expression

3502
02:30:54,680 --> 02:30:57,319
really they're they're you know

3503
02:30:55,700 --> 02:30:59,060
depending on what you're you're you're

3504
02:30:57,319 --> 02:31:01,309
growing the plants for it can make a lot

3505
02:30:59,059 --> 02:31:03,829
of sense so and if you are gonna bring

3506
02:31:01,309 --> 02:31:05,359
in one particular strain from you know

3507
02:31:03,829 --> 02:31:07,398
somebody that's selling clones or

3508
02:31:05,359 --> 02:31:09,109
something we do do really suggest to

3509
02:31:07,398 --> 02:31:10,398
grow it out really big if it's gonna be

3510
02:31:09,109 --> 02:31:12,079
something that you're gonna run and

3511
02:31:10,398 --> 02:31:13,728
you're gonna do a whole lotta or a whole

3512
02:31:12,079 --> 02:31:15,889
greenhouse over several agreement

3513
02:31:13,728 --> 02:31:17,478
greenhouses up it's good to see its full

3514
02:31:15,889 --> 02:31:19,789
expression all the way through to see

3515
02:31:17,478 --> 02:31:25,129
what kind of pasts or what kind of fungi

3516
02:31:19,790 --> 02:31:26,570
that it gets so it's interesting

3517
02:31:25,129 --> 02:31:28,000
listening to it all the different

3518
02:31:26,569 --> 02:31:32,239
perspectives

3519
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:35,180
especially the resin head size I've done

3520
02:31:32,239 --> 02:31:38,590
I've done rooms with 24 plants I've done

3521
02:31:35,180 --> 02:31:41,720
them with 240 plants and the yield wise

3522
02:31:38,590 --> 02:31:43,549
you know it can be very similar the only

3523
02:31:41,719 --> 02:31:45,349
difference being the time that you've

3524
02:31:43,549 --> 02:31:47,750
got to spend in bed and you know if

3525
02:31:45,350 --> 02:31:50,149
you're spending different or if you're

3526
02:31:47,750 --> 02:31:51,739
edging in a different area you know it

3527
02:31:50,148 --> 02:31:55,549
doesn't have to affect the flowering

3528
02:31:51,739 --> 02:31:58,069
area but it's you know the the

3529
02:31:55,549 --> 02:32:00,590
regulations the plant number is going

3530
02:31:58,069 --> 02:32:02,869
away and they appear in Washington they

3531
02:32:00,590 --> 02:32:05,000
said we could you know medical we could

3532
02:32:02,870 --> 02:32:07,220
grow 45 plants of another said how big

3533
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:09,829
they can be so you know I always did

3534
02:32:07,219 --> 02:32:12,170
really big plants and you know filled a

3535
02:32:09,829 --> 02:32:14,989
thousand square feet or 200 square feet

3536
02:32:12,170 --> 02:32:17,629
was good you know that's a member but I

3537
02:32:14,989 --> 02:32:20,539
like growing big plants and up here in

3538
02:32:17,629 --> 02:32:25,849
Washington it's not the best but you

3539
02:32:20,540 --> 02:32:30,830
know like that it it works but you know

3540
02:32:25,850 --> 02:32:32,210
it the same results can be achieved you

3541
02:32:30,829 --> 02:32:34,489
know with different number of plants

3542
02:32:32,209 --> 02:32:37,279
different sizes but the whole resin head

3543
02:32:34,489 --> 02:32:39,890
size that is interesting but it's a cool

3544
02:32:37,280 --> 02:32:43,931
thing to think about this year

3545
02:32:39,890 --> 02:32:46,100
yeah was a good one and you know I mean

3546
02:32:43,931 --> 02:32:49,551
one of the things that we kind of went

3547
02:32:46,101 --> 02:32:51,079
by to create a metric that Jonathan you

3548
02:32:49,550 --> 02:32:53,920
know we kind of came up with I think

3549
02:32:51,079 --> 02:32:56,870
through collectively responses from our

3550
02:32:53,920 --> 02:32:59,569
our the people we worked with basically

3551
02:32:56,870 --> 02:33:02,690
was that in a thousand square feet we

3552
02:32:59,569 --> 02:33:05,750
would say the minimum average harvest

3553
02:33:02,690 --> 02:33:07,069
should be fifty pounds and so you know

3554
02:33:05,750 --> 02:33:09,620
we have people up north that are

3555
02:33:07,069 --> 02:33:11,720
exceeding that number and then we have

3556
02:33:09,620 --> 02:33:13,221
some people most people actually under

3557
02:33:11,720 --> 02:33:16,129
that number I mean I know in Colorado

3558
02:33:13,220 --> 02:33:17,869
there's a couple facilities that are

3559
02:33:16,129 --> 02:33:19,670
supposedly pretty good that are running

3560
02:33:17,870 --> 02:33:22,130
at thirty-eight pounds per thousand

3561
02:33:19,670 --> 02:33:23,780
square feet and so you know originally

3562
02:33:22,129 --> 02:33:25,579
people went by you know how many pounds

3563
02:33:23,780 --> 02:33:27,409
perlite things like that and I know

3564
02:33:25,579 --> 02:33:29,440
grams per square foot is kind of a

3565
02:33:27,409 --> 02:33:32,030
popular way I think now in the indoor

3566
02:33:29,440 --> 02:33:34,159
category but you know like the

3567
02:33:32,030 --> 02:33:36,290
greenhouse on our property here it's

3568
02:33:34,159 --> 02:33:40,341
kind of back there but it's a 24 by 60

3569
02:33:36,290 --> 02:33:41,841
and it's 1440 square feet so we say the

3570
02:33:40,341 --> 02:33:45,409
minimum average harvest out of that

3571
02:33:41,841 --> 02:33:47,181
would be 75 pounds per harvest and then

3572
02:33:45,409 --> 02:33:49,610
you know we've seen up to a hundred and

3573
02:33:47,181 --> 02:33:51,829
ten but it all does come down to variety

3574
02:33:49,610 --> 02:33:54,021
and now with this plant count and going

3575
02:33:51,829 --> 02:33:56,060
into rolling benches and smaller plants

3576
02:33:54,021 --> 02:33:58,341
and things like that I'm kind of anxious

3577
02:33:56,060 --> 02:34:00,140
to see where these numbers are gonna go

3578
02:33:58,341 --> 02:34:03,440
if they kind of stay the same if they

3579
02:34:00,140 --> 02:34:05,359
increase or what but you know we're

3580
02:34:03,440 --> 02:34:06,931
still trying to do some fact finding on

3581
02:34:05,360 --> 02:34:09,931
that

3582
02:34:06,931 --> 02:34:12,030
I got another question to throw out to

3583
02:34:09,931 --> 02:34:14,431
people because this is something yeah

3584
02:34:12,030 --> 02:34:17,101
beautiful bed up there and BC you guys

3585
02:34:14,431 --> 02:34:19,290
you guys are giving love to the be stirs

3586
02:34:17,101 --> 02:34:22,290
you know you're redeeming yourselves you

3587
02:34:19,290 --> 02:34:24,000
know I think all BC should give love to

3588
02:34:22,290 --> 02:34:26,040
Kelly and Josh because they're redeeming

3589
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:30,479
the B stores up there thank you thank

3590
02:34:26,040 --> 02:34:32,580
you we'll take that there's a lot of

3591
02:34:30,479 --> 02:34:35,789
good family up in British Columbia doing

3592
02:34:32,579 --> 02:34:38,420
some good strains yeah we'll see this

3593
02:34:35,790 --> 02:34:42,091
about the B stirs the B he stirs came in

3594
02:34:38,420 --> 02:34:43,470
not far after the community of

3595
02:34:42,091 --> 02:34:44,940
Vietnamese people started growing

3596
02:34:43,470 --> 02:34:47,750
cannabis but it actually came in a

3597
02:34:44,940 --> 02:34:47,750
little bit before

3598
02:34:48,219 --> 02:34:53,199
we lost it commercially really good but

3599
02:34:51,610 --> 02:34:58,510
the real problem in the beginning from

3600
02:34:53,200 --> 02:35:03,030
BC was the integrity of the buyer the

3601
02:34:58,510 --> 02:35:03,030
integrity of the buyer is he who was

3602
02:35:04,680 --> 02:35:10,738
I really wish we could we could listen

3603
02:35:07,828 --> 02:35:13,020
to him Martin we we probably know what

3604
02:35:10,738 --> 02:35:17,668
he'll say would the integrity of the

3605
02:35:13,020 --> 02:35:20,069
buyer really affected the the grower so

3606
02:35:17,668 --> 02:35:21,840
as people moved indoors you know the

3607
02:35:20,068 --> 02:35:23,850
only constrain that they could grow was

3608
02:35:21,840 --> 02:35:26,279
the strain that the buyer was gonna buy

3609
02:35:23,850 --> 02:35:28,020
from them and there was no room for

3610
02:35:26,279 --> 02:35:30,060
creativity and there was no room for

3611
02:35:28,020 --> 02:35:32,789
anything that was organized crime at

3612
02:35:30,059 --> 02:35:35,728
that time so that was the reason why the

3613
02:35:32,789 --> 02:35:38,880
bestir started to become you know gave a

3614
02:35:35,728 --> 02:35:40,769
name for itself was really because you

3615
02:35:38,879 --> 02:35:43,408
know then the consumers didn't even

3616
02:35:40,770 --> 02:35:45,449
really realize what a real flower looked

3617
02:35:43,408 --> 02:35:49,559
like outside of what the buyer was

3618
02:35:45,449 --> 02:35:51,390
buying so we said we were getting a lot

3619
02:35:49,559 --> 02:35:53,519
of BC coming down and had been sprayed

3620
02:35:51,389 --> 02:35:55,618
with formaldehyde so they could ship it

3621
02:35:53,520 --> 02:35:58,350
wetter you know and when you asked why

3622
02:35:55,619 --> 02:36:00,390
it wasn't cured or dried the response

3623
02:35:58,350 --> 02:36:04,350
that I would get would be because you

3624
02:36:00,389 --> 02:36:12,208
get more weight when it's wet and so

3625
02:36:04,350 --> 02:36:14,068
yeah and then being in before they anand

3626
02:36:12,209 --> 02:36:16,409
dadadada you know there was a lot of

3627
02:36:14,068 --> 02:36:18,238
that but so you are getting formaldehyde

3628
02:36:16,408 --> 02:36:21,090
weed from the north and then paraquat

3629
02:36:18,238 --> 02:36:22,799
weed up from Mexico from right and give

3630
02:36:21,090 --> 02:36:24,988
thanks for the NorCal hills cuz they

3631
02:36:22,799 --> 02:36:27,118
saved the day and came in you know all

3632
02:36:24,988 --> 02:36:31,648
the Emerald triangle and up and Sierra's

3633
02:36:27,119 --> 02:36:33,449
came in and saved us at that point the

3634
02:36:31,648 --> 02:36:35,519
islands of British Columbia and out in

3635
02:36:33,449 --> 02:36:37,529
the Kootenays have you know really

3636
02:36:35,520 --> 02:36:40,800
really crucial family will give thanks

3637
02:36:37,529 --> 02:36:43,039
to them absolutely no enough love to all

3638
02:36:40,799 --> 02:36:45,840
the guns of farmers out there for sure

3639
02:36:43,039 --> 02:36:48,390
I'll have a question though about co2

3640
02:36:45,840 --> 02:36:50,039
because it's getting mentioned a lot

3641
02:36:48,389 --> 02:36:51,930
it's being brought up a lot right now

3642
02:36:50,039 --> 02:36:56,189
and getting introduced to greenhouses

3643
02:36:51,930 --> 02:36:58,498
and my biggest concern about in co2

3644
02:36:56,189 --> 02:37:00,539
injection into greenhouses is how much

3645
02:36:58,498 --> 02:37:02,340
of its getting utilized by the plants

3646
02:37:00,539 --> 02:37:07,140
and how much is just being blown into

3647
02:37:02,340 --> 02:37:08,578
the environment and yeah I just want to

3648
02:37:07,139 --> 02:37:11,148
throw that one out into the group again

3649
02:37:08,578 --> 02:37:11,148
as well

3650
02:37:14,020 --> 02:37:19,279
thought you were gonna talk about co2

3651
02:37:16,129 --> 02:37:22,579
oil or something for a second I did too

3652
02:37:19,279 --> 02:37:24,319
but I feel 2 injection into the air it's

3653
02:37:22,578 --> 02:37:25,818
now I'm seeing a lot of people messing

3654
02:37:24,318 --> 02:37:27,168
with that now and it seems like you

3655
02:37:25,818 --> 02:37:31,038
gotta apply it just at the right time

3656
02:37:27,168 --> 02:37:32,959
well you know I mean and and and have

3657
02:37:31,039 --> 02:37:35,418
the right tools to measure that to

3658
02:37:32,959 --> 02:37:38,060
quantify I guess you could say but yeah

3659
02:37:35,418 --> 02:37:40,639
that's a new that's a nice hot new topic

3660
02:37:38,059 --> 02:37:42,439
basically is running the and I've seen a

3661
02:37:40,639 --> 02:37:46,608
couple different systems out there that

3662
02:37:42,439 --> 02:37:49,430
people are pushing but yeah we've always

3663
02:37:46,609 --> 02:37:52,699
thought nature was enough but I guess

3664
02:37:49,430 --> 02:37:54,408
maybe if they want more yeah I've seen

3665
02:37:52,699 --> 02:37:56,479
that too lately a lot a bunch of friends

3666
02:37:54,408 --> 02:37:58,279
that are talking about and I don't even

3667
02:37:56,478 --> 02:38:00,349
know what the product is but they're

3668
02:37:58,279 --> 02:38:02,838
talking about how they've got this co2

3669
02:38:00,350 --> 02:38:04,759
product that where the the gas will

3670
02:38:02,838 --> 02:38:05,959
actually stay in the greenhouse even

3671
02:38:04,759 --> 02:38:08,539
though the greenhouse is rented which

3672
02:38:05,959 --> 02:38:10,850
makes I would I don't know to me it

3673
02:38:08,539 --> 02:38:12,229
makes no sense whatsoever but they're

3674
02:38:10,850 --> 02:38:15,109
claiming that that's what they're doing

3675
02:38:12,228 --> 02:38:17,719
and it took it's for the greenhouse

3676
02:38:15,109 --> 02:38:19,520
grower and the person trying to reduce

3677
02:38:17,719 --> 02:38:21,108
you know energy costs and all these

3678
02:38:19,520 --> 02:38:23,029
different things it seems

3679
02:38:21,109 --> 02:38:26,930
counterintuitive to me the plant does

3680
02:38:23,029 --> 02:38:30,408
just fine with with you know what nature

3681
02:38:26,930 --> 02:38:32,720
provides and it's your when I hear guys

3682
02:38:30,408 --> 02:38:34,009
want to do that and some of the guys

3683
02:38:32,719 --> 02:38:36,588
that I see building out these greenhouse

3684
02:38:34,009 --> 02:38:38,748
facilities right now it's like they're

3685
02:38:36,588 --> 02:38:40,219
trying to build their greenhouse it's

3686
02:38:38,748 --> 02:38:43,338
like an indoor room and they put they

3687
02:38:40,219 --> 02:38:46,328
want co2 injectors and huge HVAC systems

3688
02:38:43,338 --> 02:38:48,619
and to me it's the opposite direction of

3689
02:38:46,328 --> 02:38:49,998
which way you should be going if you are

3690
02:38:48,619 --> 02:38:52,489
you know gonna be doing greenhouse

3691
02:38:49,998 --> 02:38:54,619
warming the constant reduction

3692
02:38:52,488 --> 02:38:56,868
definitely went up we've gone one step

3693
02:38:54,619 --> 02:38:58,819
further as far as nature is concerned

3694
02:38:56,869 --> 02:39:01,668
and we're planting a lot of king

3695
02:38:58,818 --> 02:39:03,769
stropharia and as we all know you know

3696
02:39:01,668 --> 02:39:06,949
mushrooms breathe in oxygen and breathe

3697
02:39:03,770 --> 02:39:08,569
out co2 and when you have you know

3698
02:39:06,949 --> 02:39:10,759
forever beds that you're adding a

3699
02:39:08,568 --> 02:39:12,648
tremendous amount of you know compost to

3700
02:39:10,759 --> 02:39:14,658
or a different type of leaf material to

3701
02:39:12,648 --> 02:39:15,978
it's really imperative to have that

3702
02:39:14,658 --> 02:39:18,529
quick breaker downer

3703
02:39:15,978 --> 02:39:20,538
you know the composter which is the king

3704
02:39:18,529 --> 02:39:22,459
stropharia so you get three different

3705
02:39:20,539 --> 02:39:24,739
things out of it it breaks down your

3706
02:39:22,459 --> 02:39:27,439
soil it lets off Co

3707
02:39:24,738 --> 02:39:29,568
- and it's delicious to eat so it's a

3708
02:39:27,439 --> 02:39:31,729
cold co2 so it's not the kind of co2

3709
02:39:29,568 --> 02:39:34,219
that goes up into the atmosphere it's a

3710
02:39:31,728 --> 02:39:36,168
kind of co2 that stays more you know a

3711
02:39:34,219 --> 02:39:38,599
ground-level you can also even stay

3712
02:39:36,168 --> 02:39:41,628
right around the soil it's also really

3713
02:39:38,600 --> 02:39:43,789
smart to do log culture you know

3714
02:39:41,629 --> 02:39:45,709
underneath your your your ganja and you

3715
02:39:43,789 --> 02:39:48,470
can be like a mulch layer you can just

3716
02:39:45,709 --> 02:39:49,819
do a bunch of round logs right next to

3717
02:39:48,469 --> 02:39:51,738
each other right at the base and then

3718
02:39:49,818 --> 02:39:54,498
they'll grow medicinal mushrooms and

3719
02:39:51,738 --> 02:39:56,689
exhale co2 so I think if you're in a

3720
02:39:54,498 --> 02:39:58,279
greenhouse you know you're in nature and

3721
02:39:56,689 --> 02:40:00,199
I think you should just enhance nature

3722
02:39:58,279 --> 02:40:03,289
and I think if you're using a greenhouse

3723
02:40:00,199 --> 02:40:07,369
to you know it be an outdoor grow room

3724
02:40:03,289 --> 02:40:09,680
then it can happen secondary products is

3725
02:40:07,369 --> 02:40:11,899
so supportive you know we're all just

3726
02:40:09,680 --> 02:40:13,369
pushing a lot of cannabis but to mix

3727
02:40:11,898 --> 02:40:15,439
cannabis with different medicinal

3728
02:40:13,369 --> 02:40:17,418
mushrooms is absolutely key these

3729
02:40:15,439 --> 02:40:19,459
beautiful to adaptogen is coming

3730
02:40:17,418 --> 02:40:21,529
together you can have so many different

3731
02:40:19,459 --> 02:40:23,359
types of secondary products that you can

3732
02:40:21,529 --> 02:40:24,770
you know be growing and getting out to

3733
02:40:23,359 --> 02:40:27,140
market or even getting to your

3734
02:40:24,770 --> 02:40:33,789
dispensaries and mushrooms is one of

3735
02:40:27,139 --> 02:40:33,788
them we like mushrooms

3736
02:40:36,059 --> 02:40:40,799
how do you spell that that's a that's

3737
02:40:38,549 --> 02:40:45,479
super interesting I want to I want to

3738
02:40:40,799 --> 02:40:49,649
check that out little bit it's a it's a

3739
02:40:45,479 --> 02:40:51,510
king stropharia mushroom for sure I want

3740
02:40:49,649 --> 02:40:53,449
to try them in about regional growing

3741
02:40:51,510 --> 02:40:55,590
bubble man touched on it when we first

3742
02:40:53,450 --> 02:40:57,600
started talking and it's really

3743
02:40:55,590 --> 02:40:59,790
important because I came from San Diego

3744
02:40:57,600 --> 02:41:01,800
I'm regionally a landscaper so I've been

3745
02:40:59,790 --> 02:41:04,380
plant things since I was 12 years old

3746
02:41:01,799 --> 02:41:07,049
and each region's a little so much

3747
02:41:04,379 --> 02:41:09,659
different in a growing climate and like

3748
02:41:07,049 --> 02:41:11,969
in San Diego we were growing we grew

3749
02:41:09,659 --> 02:41:15,149
under shade cloth and that's that became

3750
02:41:11,969 --> 02:41:17,609
a shade cloth band up here in Washington

3751
02:41:15,149 --> 02:41:18,809
I still use it a light shade cloth

3752
02:41:17,610 --> 02:41:22,470
through the whole season

3753
02:41:18,809 --> 02:41:24,629
it's it benefits me with the passive

3754
02:41:22,469 --> 02:41:26,219
airflow that we get we get a really nice

3755
02:41:24,629 --> 02:41:28,109
breeze that starts at 3 o'clock and

3756
02:41:26,219 --> 02:41:29,549
stops at 11 o'clock it comes off the

3757
02:41:28,110 --> 02:41:31,319
mouth of the Columbia and we're in this

3758
02:41:29,549 --> 02:41:33,329
just this little sweet zone where it

3759
02:41:31,319 --> 02:41:36,119
just blows through this nice cool air

3760
02:41:33,329 --> 02:41:38,039
and it really makes for a really good

3761
02:41:36,120 --> 02:41:41,940
growing thing but it you know it took

3762
02:41:38,040 --> 02:41:44,010
years to you know develop the style and

3763
02:41:41,940 --> 02:41:46,620
get used to your place and what works

3764
02:41:44,010 --> 02:41:48,930
best you know in that environment we

3765
02:41:46,620 --> 02:41:51,540
like to use shade cloth we've been using

3766
02:41:48,930 --> 02:41:53,850
shade cloth pretty much ly not the whole

3767
02:41:51,540 --> 02:41:56,880
season we're out September we'll pull it

3768
02:41:53,850 --> 02:41:59,250
off so we get some extra light its I

3769
02:41:56,879 --> 02:42:01,619
travel a lot so I can't really light

3770
02:41:59,250 --> 02:42:03,510
them too much so we just you know as

3771
02:42:01,620 --> 02:42:05,640
soon as the first sign of any problems

3772
02:42:03,510 --> 02:42:08,399
that's when we pull really nothing you

3773
02:42:05,639 --> 02:42:12,809
know goes full fully full-term on our

3774
02:42:08,399 --> 02:42:15,930
farm and it was and sex go we're huge

3775
02:42:12,809 --> 02:42:18,719
fans of trap plants so we plant we have

3776
02:42:15,930 --> 02:42:21,360
continuous rounds of green beans and we

3777
02:42:18,719 --> 02:42:24,209
also have continuous rounds of eggplant

3778
02:42:21,360 --> 02:42:27,420
because what we find is the bugs will go

3779
02:42:24,209 --> 02:42:30,419
to the trap plants before though go up

3780
02:42:27,420 --> 02:42:32,309
into the plants and I think just getting

3781
02:42:30,420 --> 02:42:34,469
known to your in your region we're in

3782
02:42:32,309 --> 02:42:36,119
the Willamette Valley here in Vancouver

3783
02:42:34,469 --> 02:42:37,889
Washington the Portland area so we're

3784
02:42:36,120 --> 02:42:40,110
kind of like the north end of the

3785
02:42:37,889 --> 02:42:42,599
Willamette Valley and we have a really

3786
02:42:40,110 --> 02:42:43,909
great greenhouse growing environment

3787
02:42:42,600 --> 02:42:46,399
here and

3788
02:42:43,909 --> 02:42:49,119
those are some of the things that you

3789
02:42:46,399 --> 02:42:53,050
know I've learned over the years and

3790
02:42:49,120 --> 02:42:53,051
that's there we go

3791
02:42:53,649 --> 02:43:00,380
yeah that's useful I think that cover

3792
02:42:56,989 --> 02:43:02,540
crops can even become a trap on accident

3793
02:43:00,380 --> 02:43:04,699
you know for pests and if people leave

3794
02:43:02,540 --> 02:43:07,939
their cover crops too long or if it's

3795
02:43:04,700 --> 02:43:09,950
they have a pest outbreak maybe you know

3796
02:43:07,940 --> 02:43:12,140
it can go on to the to the cover crop so

3797
02:43:09,950 --> 02:43:13,940
just having biodiversity I think we

3798
02:43:12,140 --> 02:43:15,921
think of having biodiversity and that's

3799
02:43:13,940 --> 02:43:18,200
a big part of our peer certification and

3800
02:43:15,921 --> 02:43:19,761
the farms that we work with and people

3801
02:43:18,200 --> 02:43:21,200
can look up you know the farms that we

3802
02:43:19,761 --> 02:43:23,989
work with and we have a new website

3803
02:43:21,200 --> 02:43:25,370
called dem pure farms com we'll just say

3804
02:43:23,989 --> 02:43:27,199
that now because its brand new in the

3805
02:43:25,370 --> 02:43:28,581
last couple days and it's going to

3806
02:43:27,200 --> 02:43:30,681
highlight the farms that are doing

3807
02:43:28,581 --> 02:43:32,720
interesting work and tremendous amounts

3808
02:43:30,681 --> 02:43:34,640
of educational practices yeah and we

3809
02:43:32,720 --> 02:43:37,850
really encourage just going back to what

3810
02:43:34,640 --> 02:43:41,001
everybody's saying education yeah yeah

3811
02:43:37,851 --> 02:43:42,711
it's really important to us so but yeah

3812
02:43:41,001 --> 02:43:44,601
you know the just having diversity

3813
02:43:42,710 --> 02:43:47,449
around your greenhouse even if it's

3814
02:43:44,601 --> 02:43:49,761
flowers around your greenhouse maybe as

3815
02:43:47,450 --> 02:43:52,280
sunflowers maybe it's marigolds maybe

3816
02:43:49,761 --> 02:43:54,979
it's geraniums cuz geraniums never get

3817
02:43:52,280 --> 02:43:57,200
bugs on them you know it's it's just a

3818
02:43:54,979 --> 02:43:58,761
it's a whole bunch of things that you

3819
02:43:57,200 --> 02:44:00,561
know make it important and it's things

3820
02:43:58,761 --> 02:44:02,211
that we don't even know about because

3821
02:44:00,560 --> 02:44:03,979
we're just enhancing nature by having

3822
02:44:02,210 --> 02:44:05,569
diversity or and another thing to add is

3823
02:44:03,979 --> 02:44:07,850
that we're realizing you know different

3824
02:44:05,569 --> 02:44:09,921
types of terpenes if you've had a really

3825
02:44:07,851 --> 02:44:12,200
horrible outbreak of mites and you've

3826
02:44:09,921 --> 02:44:14,720
had many years of it you know there's

3827
02:44:12,200 --> 02:44:16,909
the jaren all you know lemony nits

3828
02:44:14,720 --> 02:44:19,430
another one and lynn Ahlul those are

3829
02:44:16,909 --> 02:44:21,921
terpenes that really you know pests do

3830
02:44:19,431 --> 02:44:24,291
not like to be around at all so really

3831
02:44:21,921 --> 02:44:26,421
trying to find varieties that contain

3832
02:44:24,290 --> 02:44:30,680
those high terpene levels will be also

3833
02:44:26,421 --> 02:44:32,450
really helpful and I'd like to also just

3834
02:44:30,681 --> 02:44:34,341
remind people this time of the year in

3835
02:44:32,450 --> 02:44:36,591
the wintertime if you are growing in the

3836
02:44:34,341 --> 02:44:38,831
in the wintertime to maintain higher

3837
02:44:36,591 --> 02:44:40,909
soil temps I've seen a couple people

3838
02:44:38,831 --> 02:44:43,251
noticing that their plants aren't where

3839
02:44:40,909 --> 02:44:46,130
they should be right now as far as like

3840
02:44:43,251 --> 02:44:48,050
flower production and and some people

3841
02:44:46,130 --> 02:44:50,090
try to discuss you know maybe it's the

3842
02:44:48,050 --> 02:44:52,010
UV maybe it's the temperature maybe it's

3843
02:44:50,091 --> 02:44:54,291
you know the air temperature and some of

3844
02:44:52,011 --> 02:44:56,690
these other factors and nine times out

3845
02:44:54,290 --> 02:44:57,859
of ten a six inch soil probe going into

3846
02:44:56,690 --> 02:44:59,810
your soil

3847
02:44:57,860 --> 02:45:02,271
we'll tell you how cold or warm your

3848
02:44:59,810 --> 02:45:03,860
soil is and you know the soil when

3849
02:45:02,271 --> 02:45:06,110
you're in grow bags I like to call

3850
02:45:03,860 --> 02:45:08,300
growing in 30 gallon or bigger grow bags

3851
02:45:06,110 --> 02:45:10,460
NorCal style because when there wasn't

3852
02:45:08,299 --> 02:45:11,959
when there was plant counts everybody

3853
02:45:10,459 --> 02:45:13,699
wanted to grow the biggest plant they

3854
02:45:11,959 --> 02:45:16,699
possibly could but they wanted to do

3855
02:45:13,700 --> 02:45:19,070
light DEP and so the 30 to 45 gallon

3856
02:45:16,700 --> 02:45:21,110
grow bag got pretty popular and when you

3857
02:45:19,069 --> 02:45:23,569
put that type of a grow bag on the earth

3858
02:45:21,110 --> 02:45:24,980
or even a grow bed for that matter the

3859
02:45:23,569 --> 02:45:27,139
temperature of the soil will fluctuate

3860
02:45:24,979 --> 02:45:29,029
with the weather even so when it's warm

3861
02:45:27,139 --> 02:45:31,489
temperatures like this our soil temps

3862
02:45:29,030 --> 02:45:33,140
obviously go up and when its rainy they

3863
02:45:31,489 --> 02:45:35,510
go down and when we have the cold snaps

3864
02:45:33,139 --> 02:45:37,579
they go down tremendously and so we've

3865
02:45:35,510 --> 02:45:38,810
seen that you know or you guys soil

3866
02:45:37,579 --> 02:45:41,479
people have taught us that anything

3867
02:45:38,810 --> 02:45:44,629
below 55 degrees we don't have nutrient

3868
02:45:41,479 --> 02:45:47,239
exchange and good mobility for life and

3869
02:45:44,629 --> 02:45:49,009
so what I find in the wintertime is most

3870
02:45:47,239 --> 02:45:51,340
soil temperatures are under fifty five

3871
02:45:49,010 --> 02:45:54,889
degrees whether they're a painter or a

3872
02:45:51,340 --> 02:45:56,540
or a bed and so if you don't have soil

3873
02:45:54,889 --> 02:45:58,639
temperatures above fifty five degrees

3874
02:45:56,540 --> 02:46:00,740
you're gonna have trouble getting the

3875
02:45:58,639 --> 02:46:02,779
same production or quality of flour that

3876
02:46:00,739 --> 02:46:05,629
you would normally get in the spring or

3877
02:46:02,780 --> 02:46:07,579
the summer time and so you know a six

3878
02:46:05,629 --> 02:46:09,349
inch soil probes really easy to get on

3879
02:46:07,579 --> 02:46:11,149
Amazon and have it sent to you I also

3880
02:46:09,350 --> 02:46:13,460
get the infrared thermometer so you can

3881
02:46:11,149 --> 02:46:15,770
point and shoot the surface temps to

3882
02:46:13,459 --> 02:46:17,539
find out in the summer time how hot the

3883
02:46:15,771 --> 02:46:19,760
surface of the plant is how hot the

3884
02:46:17,540 --> 02:46:21,140
ground is a bunch of different things

3885
02:46:19,760 --> 02:46:23,120
you know so you can really kind of get

3886
02:46:21,139 --> 02:46:24,799
in tune because again that temp and

3887
02:46:23,120 --> 02:46:26,780
humidity thermostat that we normally

3888
02:46:24,799 --> 02:46:28,759
would go to in a grow room or even a

3889
02:46:26,780 --> 02:46:32,329
greenhouse controller doesn't really

3890
02:46:28,760 --> 02:46:33,829
tell us everything and so I you know I

3891
02:46:32,329 --> 02:46:35,209
have some people that I'm working with

3892
02:46:33,829 --> 02:46:37,010
that do you have you know they're doing

3893
02:46:35,209 --> 02:46:39,259
really a great job but one of the things

3894
02:46:37,010 --> 02:46:40,819
that we were kind of noticing is for

3895
02:46:39,260 --> 02:46:42,710
they mentioned to me about the

3896
02:46:40,819 --> 02:46:46,159
wintertime growing in some soil temps

3897
02:46:42,709 --> 02:46:48,319
dripping dipping they have a radiant

3898
02:46:46,159 --> 02:46:51,649
heating system the soil temps are up to

3899
02:46:48,319 --> 02:46:54,110
the 70s but then watering with 55 degree

3900
02:46:51,649 --> 02:46:56,479
well water will shock the roots and

3901
02:46:54,110 --> 02:46:58,670
actually cause your system to have to

3902
02:46:56,479 --> 02:47:01,760
regenerate and heat back up again and so

3903
02:46:58,670 --> 02:47:03,379
you know it's kind of a minut thing you

3904
02:47:01,760 --> 02:47:04,940
know when you think about it or just

3905
02:47:03,379 --> 02:47:06,739
when you're speaking about it I guess

3906
02:47:04,940 --> 02:47:08,569
you say but when you really think about

3907
02:47:06,739 --> 02:47:10,469
it and what you're doing it it can make

3908
02:47:08,569 --> 02:47:12,029
quite a difference and so

3909
02:47:10,469 --> 02:47:13,679
you know that's why I really try to

3910
02:47:12,030 --> 02:47:15,930
differentiate the difference between

3911
02:47:13,680 --> 02:47:18,390
winter mode greenhouses and summer mode

3912
02:47:15,930 --> 02:47:20,489
greenhouses you know greenhouses were

3913
02:47:18,390 --> 02:47:21,840
invented and designed for wintertime and

3914
02:47:20,489 --> 02:47:23,879
when you try to use them in the summer

3915
02:47:21,840 --> 02:47:26,390
they can be difficult but they'll do

3916
02:47:23,879 --> 02:47:29,009
really well in the winter time so I mean

3917
02:47:26,390 --> 02:47:30,840
some to keep in mind is that you can

3918
02:47:29,010 --> 02:47:32,280
really change the winter mode greenhouse

3919
02:47:30,840 --> 02:47:34,649
to a summer mode whether you're in a

3920
02:47:32,280 --> 02:47:37,021
hoop midtech or a high-tech greenhouse

3921
02:47:34,649 --> 02:47:38,369
and it just takes some thinking and

3922
02:47:37,021 --> 02:47:40,250
understanding and looking at the

3923
02:47:38,370 --> 02:47:43,880
greenhouse to decide which is the best

3924
02:47:40,250 --> 02:47:46,351
method to go about doing that but again

3925
02:47:43,879 --> 02:47:47,939
greenhouses were invented for wintertime

3926
02:47:46,351 --> 02:47:49,620
and most greenhouse companies are

3927
02:47:47,940 --> 02:47:52,290
selling you a greenhouse that is gonna

3928
02:47:49,620 --> 02:47:54,690
do what it's supposed to do work well in

3929
02:47:52,290 --> 02:47:55,950
the wintertime and so when we talk you

3930
02:47:54,690 --> 02:47:58,649
know hey we're gonna be out in the hot

3931
02:47:55,950 --> 02:48:00,210
Summer Sun it might be the easy default

3932
02:47:58,649 --> 02:48:02,190
to say you need a wet wall cooling

3933
02:48:00,209 --> 02:48:04,679
system and a wet wall is an evaporative

3934
02:48:02,190 --> 02:48:06,989
cooler so it's basically based on water

3935
02:48:04,680 --> 02:48:08,700
trickling over a pad and then the

3936
02:48:06,989 --> 02:48:10,739
exhaust fans at the opposite end of the

3937
02:48:08,700 --> 02:48:15,780
greenhouse exchanging the air and

3938
02:48:10,739 --> 02:48:17,190
hopefully that air can be cooled passing

3939
02:48:15,780 --> 02:48:18,930
through the greenhouse but if you're in

3940
02:48:17,190 --> 02:48:21,239
a humid area it's not gonna work that

3941
02:48:18,930 --> 02:48:23,399
way so here in the Gold Country or the

3942
02:48:21,239 --> 02:48:26,851
foothills where we are they can work at

3943
02:48:23,399 --> 02:48:28,350
times but they're not 365 24/7 and when

3944
02:48:26,851 --> 02:48:30,300
you get into humid places like the

3945
02:48:28,351 --> 02:48:32,610
Emerald triangle and I'm not talking

3946
02:48:30,299 --> 02:48:34,709
terribly humid but you know over 47

3947
02:48:32,610 --> 02:48:36,271
percent relative humidity you're not

3948
02:48:34,709 --> 02:48:38,009
gonna see much reduction in temperature

3949
02:48:36,271 --> 02:48:40,440
and that's why we really try to talk

3950
02:48:38,010 --> 02:48:42,180
about cooling surfaces rather curling

3951
02:48:40,440 --> 02:48:43,800
the air to do that because most

3952
02:48:42,180 --> 02:48:46,159
greenhouse companies are gonna try to

3953
02:48:43,799 --> 02:48:49,140
sell you a winter mode greenhouse as

3954
02:48:46,159 --> 02:48:50,969
designed and then the default is that

3955
02:48:49,140 --> 02:48:52,500
evaporative cooler and that's just not

3956
02:48:50,969 --> 02:48:54,840
going to work for everybody everywhere

3957
02:48:52,500 --> 02:48:57,000
and so again if you understand the

3958
02:48:54,840 --> 02:48:59,579
cannabis plant - you can really work

3959
02:48:57,000 --> 02:49:01,739
well with a greenhouse in the summertime

3960
02:48:59,579 --> 02:49:04,319
knowing how cannabis wants to sweat and

3961
02:49:01,739 --> 02:49:06,569
as easily to keep cool without a cooling

3962
02:49:04,319 --> 02:49:08,640
system doing all these things in the

3963
02:49:06,569 --> 02:49:10,529
right manners and then paying attention

3964
02:49:08,640 --> 02:49:12,719
to that soil biology I mean some of the

3965
02:49:10,530 --> 02:49:14,460
I think the show goes till about 12:00

3966
02:49:12,719 --> 02:49:16,619
and some of the last things that I would

3967
02:49:14,459 --> 02:49:18,679
you know wrap up with is that don't

3968
02:49:16,620 --> 02:49:21,510
always pay attention to the environment

3969
02:49:18,680 --> 02:49:23,579
we in the cannabis community and

3970
02:49:21,510 --> 02:49:24,329
industry chase the environment so much

3971
02:49:23,579 --> 02:49:25,979
the

3972
02:49:24,329 --> 02:49:28,829
a lot of people forget what's going on

3973
02:49:25,979 --> 02:49:30,989
underground and it's easy to overwater

3974
02:49:28,829 --> 02:49:33,629
it's easy to let your soils get cold

3975
02:49:30,989 --> 02:49:36,389
it's easy to let things slide sometimes

3976
02:49:33,629 --> 02:49:40,020
and the biology is an important part of

3977
02:49:36,389 --> 02:49:42,510
the system and so if you want control in

3978
02:49:40,021 --> 02:49:44,070
your greenhouse make sure you understand

3979
02:49:42,510 --> 02:49:46,950
what's going on underground as well

3980
02:49:44,069 --> 02:49:52,920
because in the environments only half

3981
02:49:46,950 --> 02:49:54,510
the battle in my opinion totally agree I

3982
02:49:52,920 --> 02:49:57,180
also think that everyone should have a

3983
02:49:54,510 --> 02:50:00,420
microscope and get closer to their Leafs

3984
02:49:57,180 --> 02:50:03,120
then just the little handheld ones that

3985
02:50:00,420 --> 02:50:05,159
are common for spider mites I think it

3986
02:50:03,120 --> 02:50:08,280
takes a microscope or getting in there

3987
02:50:05,159 --> 02:50:10,170
60 you know or even thousand times and

3988
02:50:08,280 --> 02:50:13,620
even having one that goes to your

3989
02:50:10,170 --> 02:50:16,500
computer screen that has a video on it

3990
02:50:13,620 --> 02:50:19,410
that you can you can take them a lot a

3991
02:50:16,500 --> 02:50:23,129
log of your pictures or videos even you

3992
02:50:19,409 --> 02:50:24,959
can take a compost tea or tea and look

3993
02:50:23,129 --> 02:50:27,089
at our microscope as well I think that's

3994
02:50:24,959 --> 02:50:33,060
really important to add to what you said

3995
02:50:27,090 --> 02:50:35,130
Eric so yeah and your your every and

3996
02:50:33,060 --> 02:50:37,709
touching your soil after every run makes

3997
02:50:35,129 --> 02:50:40,139
a lot of sense and and we really

3998
02:50:37,709 --> 02:50:42,029
recommend that ya testing everything is

3999
02:50:40,139 --> 02:50:43,770
important I mean the inputs these days

4000
02:50:42,030 --> 02:50:45,120
you never know where you're getting it

4001
02:50:43,771 --> 02:50:46,710
for I mean you might know where you're

4002
02:50:45,120 --> 02:50:48,990
getting it from but how long has it been

4003
02:50:46,709 --> 02:50:50,339
in the bag how long has it been you know

4004
02:50:48,989 --> 02:50:52,350
sitting around or through these

4005
02:50:50,340 --> 02:50:53,960
processes and so we really want to make

4006
02:50:52,350 --> 02:50:56,670
sure we're testing all our ingredients

4007
02:50:53,959 --> 02:50:58,579
you know making sure that everything

4008
02:50:56,670 --> 02:51:01,350
that we're using is gonna work because

4009
02:50:58,579 --> 02:51:03,600
according to Nevada and it looks like

4010
02:51:01,350 --> 02:51:06,420
maybe California it'll be pretty easy to

4011
02:51:03,600 --> 02:51:08,579
fail a test if you don't follow a lot of

4012
02:51:06,420 --> 02:51:11,040
the proper guidelines and keep it things

4013
02:51:08,579 --> 02:51:14,250
clean the Department of pesticide

4014
02:51:11,040 --> 02:51:15,780
regulation release the allowable stuff

4015
02:51:14,250 --> 02:51:19,110
for cannabis and there isn't much

4016
02:51:15,780 --> 02:51:20,790
allowed huh as far as pesticides and

4017
02:51:19,110 --> 02:51:22,650
fungicides and herbicides that people

4018
02:51:20,790 --> 02:51:25,110
would want to use and and maybe even

4019
02:51:22,649 --> 02:51:27,449
fine to be organic in some cases but

4020
02:51:25,110 --> 02:51:29,700
it's not going to be okay for cannabis

4021
02:51:27,450 --> 02:51:32,490
and a lot of people try to you know

4022
02:51:29,700 --> 02:51:34,409
compare cannabis to other vegetables and

4023
02:51:32,489 --> 02:51:37,619
farming and I always try to say that you

4024
02:51:34,409 --> 02:51:38,159
know you can't take a flower and go wipe

4025
02:51:37,620 --> 02:51:39,811
it on your

4026
02:51:38,159 --> 02:51:41,700
shirt like you would an apple before you

4027
02:51:39,810 --> 02:51:46,170
eat it you can't wash it off you don't

4028
02:51:41,700 --> 02:51:47,670
you know blanch it or or pasteurized it

4029
02:51:46,170 --> 02:51:50,250
or any of these other things that you do

4030
02:51:47,670 --> 02:51:51,810
with food before it gets to people a lot

4031
02:51:50,250 --> 02:51:53,610
of people don't realize what their food

4032
02:51:51,810 --> 02:51:57,690
goes through before it reaches the

4033
02:51:53,610 --> 02:52:00,120
shelves as far as being sanitized you

4034
02:51:57,690 --> 02:52:02,159
know and so cannabis can go through some

4035
02:52:00,120 --> 02:52:04,079
of the same things but you know UV light

4036
02:52:02,159 --> 02:52:05,760
you know I think there's some weird

4037
02:52:04,079 --> 02:52:09,539
microwave things out there these days

4038
02:52:05,760 --> 02:52:11,310
but I mean at the end of the day you

4039
02:52:09,540 --> 02:52:13,620
know we can't always compare what

4040
02:52:11,310 --> 02:52:16,860
happens in regular AG to cannabis and I

4041
02:52:13,620 --> 02:52:19,079
see that happening a lot these days but

4042
02:52:16,860 --> 02:52:21,180
you know making sure you know what

4043
02:52:19,079 --> 02:52:23,521
you're using and making sure that your

4044
02:52:21,180 --> 02:52:26,190
soil is healthy so the e can grow clean

4045
02:52:23,521 --> 02:52:28,950
healthy plants and the environment that

4046
02:52:26,190 --> 02:52:30,930
you growing is is conducive to that but

4047
02:52:28,950 --> 02:52:32,760
I mean as we start to wrap up here

4048
02:52:30,930 --> 02:52:35,250
closer to 12 o'clock I think it's

4049
02:52:32,760 --> 02:52:36,960
important for everybody to let each all

4050
02:52:35,250 --> 02:52:39,590
of us know how to get a hold of each

4051
02:52:36,959 --> 02:52:42,029
other in case anybody wants to connect

4052
02:52:39,590 --> 02:52:43,829
so that we can share information or

4053
02:52:42,030 --> 02:52:47,159
maybe meet up down the road or help out

4054
02:52:43,829 --> 02:52:48,810
a friend if we need to and so mica can

4055
02:52:47,159 --> 02:52:50,549
we start off with you what's the best

4056
02:52:48,810 --> 02:52:53,279

has a whole entire page of closed loops

4281
03:02:25,399 --> 03:02:29,810
when people asked what is a closed loop

4282
03:02:27,771 --> 03:02:32,061
if it's not for you know it's one on the

4283
03:02:29,810 --> 03:02:34,101
on the land it's it's anything that one

4284
03:02:32,060 --> 03:02:35,869
system leads into the other system

4285
03:02:34,101 --> 03:02:38,090
whether it's alternative energy or

4286
03:02:35,870 --> 03:02:41,960
reusing your soils or growing your own

4287

4289
03:02:43,969 --> 03:02:47,989
like-minded people

4290
03:02:46,069 --> 03:02:49,851
regenerative cannabis farmers joining

4291
03:02:47,989 --> 03:02:51,560
together and we do really encourage

4292
03:02:49,851 --> 03:02:53,930
people in the industry to join together

4293
03:02:51,560 --> 03:02:57,590
because that's the way that this craft

4294
03:02:53,930 --> 03:02:59,300
cannabis superhigh bom-bom fire is going

4295
03:02:57,590 --> 03:03:01,069
to make it out into the industry and

4296
03:02:59,299 --> 03:03:03,079
encouraging people to work together on

4297
03:03:01,069 --> 03:03:05,119
the dispensary front and on the

4298
03:03:03,079 --> 03:03:07,129
processing front to utilize their

4299
03:03:05,120 --> 03:03:10,130
medicine in their cannabis and in a in

4300
03:03:07,129 --> 03:03:12,679
an excellent way we're going to Jamaica

4301
03:03:10,129 --> 03:03:14,679
on March 1st for two weeks ourselves and

4302
03:03:12,680 --> 03:03:16,489
we're being invited by a Rastafarian

4303
03:03:14,680 --> 03:03:19,550
community there and we're gonna go

4304
03:03:16,489 --> 03:03:22,940
really dive into spiritual cannabis on

4305
03:03:19,549 --> 03:03:25,670
Jamaica and learn about their ways and

4306
03:03:22,940 --> 03:03:27,860
their ways of connecting with the earth

4307
03:03:25,670 --> 03:03:29,360
and midwives of spiritual healers so

4308
03:03:27,860 --> 03:03:31,510
we're really really excited to talk

4309
03:03:29,360 --> 03:03:33,920
about regenerative cannabis there and

4310
03:03:31,510 --> 03:03:36,170
growing and cultivating cannabis

4311
03:03:33,920 --> 03:03:39,560
off-the-grid in a spiritual way that's

4312
03:03:36,170 --> 03:03:42,170
really important to us and also we are

4313
03:03:39,560 --> 03:03:43,909
going to be at the living soil symposium

4314
03:03:42,170 --> 03:03:45,379
happening at the end of March which is

4315
03:03:43,909 --> 03:03:47,930
going to be a wonderful collection of

4316
03:03:45,379 --> 03:03:51,019
really beautiful people which can

4317
03:03:47,930 --> 03:03:54,079
help answer the question of how to move

4318
03:03:51,020 --> 03:03:56,000
regenerative cannabis forward and reget

4319
03:03:54,079 --> 03:04:00,978
generative cannabis is important because

4320
03:03:56,000 --> 03:04:03,978
the mainstream big AG crazy days are on

4321
03:04:00,978 --> 03:04:06,049

4322
03:04:03,978 --> 03:04:08,148

4323
03:04:06,049 --> 03:04:10,340
our integrity and our love and our

4324
03:04:08,148 --> 03:04:11,778
stories and our better strains that we

4325
03:04:10,340 --> 03:04:15,139

4326
03:04:11,779 --> 03:04:17,270
forward so I'd like to thank bubbleman

4327
03:04:15,139 --> 03:04:19,099
