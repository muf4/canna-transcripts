[Music]

2
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:24,198
hey guys welcome to Bubble man's world

3
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,080
I'm here down at the cchq on the second

4
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:28,400
floor of the vapor lounge and I'm with

5
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:29,719
Opus 420 hey hey how's it going dude

6
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:30,959
what's going excellent brother to see

7
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:32,920
you man very good to see always good to

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,640
see you uh ois and I were sitting and

9
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:36,280
talking for the last little bit and we

10
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,960
realized that we could have been filming

11
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,879
a little episode while we were sitting

12
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:42,239
and talking so we've got the uh the

13
00:00:39,878 --> 00:00:44,159
motherships ready to go we were talking

14
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:47,078
about the difference between silicon

15
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:48,878
carbide right and quartz so I thought

16
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:51,320
maybe a fun little experiment for you

17
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:53,960
would be to have a rip of the same hash

18
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:56,759
on either surface and tell us what you

19
00:00:53,960 --> 00:01:01,878
think I could do that so I've got a

20
00:00:56,759 --> 00:01:04,519
bunch of uh d420 K hash o he gifted me

21
00:01:01,878 --> 00:01:06,359
recently oh that's a call from Horatio

22
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:09,439
we have to uh take

23
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:12,000
a take a rain check on that

24
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:17,319
one little Variety in

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:20,239
there oh wow that's a uh just a mix

26
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:22,879
of different fragrances yes well we're

27
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:26,000
going to go with uh the all powerful uh

28
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:28,599
New York City Diesel which is a Soma

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,920
special looks almost like Wax this is

30
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:31,919
dry Sip and smell that

31
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:38,040
oh my God and it does awesome and it

32
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:42,240
does it looks just like Wax yeah and if

33
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:45,439
is that uh God uh quick froze uh this is

34
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:47,239
dry sifted uh not fresh frozen uh not

35
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:50,519
bubble hash but made with mechanical

36
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:52,438
screams just just sifted gently and then

37
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:53,920
cleaned using a couple uh different

38
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:56,398
techniques that we talk about on Bubble

39
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,960
man's world uh Darren would have used uh

40
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,920
carding static carding and uh

41
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:02,559
potentially the two gravity trick which

42
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:04,320
are all things that I cover on my

43
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,478
channel little tricks of the trade for

44
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:09,560
making hash but uh I want to start you

45
00:02:07,478 --> 00:02:13,400
off

46
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:15,080
with the quartz all right um quartz now

47
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,360
takes a little bit more energy and a

48
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:19,480
little bit more heat to get it up to

49
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,040
temperature each time if you're using a

50
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:23,199
torch uh they've uh the guys at Dil have

51
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:25,919
done some pretty good

52
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:27,518
thermodynamics uh testing on both the

53
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:29,479
different uh sources not just the

54
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:33,560
different ones but quite a few uh from

55
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:37,799
Titan ium to ceramic so this will be uh

56
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,800
the New York City Diesel dryft on the

57
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:43,759
quartz oh wait

58
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:45,400
fail it's not on we haven't turned it on

59
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:49,439
yet but watch how fast we can fix this

60
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:51,840
fail plug that back in get that back on

61
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:55,359
get this back on the

62
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:58,158
Dabber we've got the units on and the

63
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,480
unit is climbing so hey sometimes you

64
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:02,039
can see when you have a little bit of a

65
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:05,280
fail with your denail like we just did

66
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:06,719
getting all stoned prior um you can fix

67
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,680
it pretty quick so I'm going to turn on

68
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:10,280
the dabinator as well just to make sure

69
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,959
both units are

70
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,840
on there's steps to things and we skip

71
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,560
one oh yeah sometimes it's fun to skip

72
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:20,000
steps until you put the hash in the

73
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:22,598
quartz and you're like nothing's going

74
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,840
on I think it's working man and it's

75
00:03:22,598 --> 00:03:29,158
just sitting there hey awesome that's

76
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:31,400
not very melty well we're already at 429

77
00:03:29,158 --> 00:03:33,199
de you you see the Dil doesn't take very

78
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:36,599
long to heat up it's going to get us up

79
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:37,878
to 700 it's usually within 2 minutes

80
00:03:36,598 --> 00:03:39,840
it's one of the things I really like

81
00:03:37,878 --> 00:03:41,120
about the the denail the quality I don't

82
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,920
know if it has anything to do with the

83
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,400
quality of the um components that he's

84
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:47,878
using but you can see that it's climbing

85
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,519
uh somewhat

86
00:03:47,878 --> 00:03:54,798
faster yeah this one really is getting

87
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:58,560
up there fast yeah 620 630

88
00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:00,519
mhm so I'd say once we get up to 700 I

89
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,759
would just let that heat for just a

90
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:04,039
minute or two and then we'll give you

91
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:05,280
the dab so you don't get that super slow

92
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:07,959
slow dab

93
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,680
on and that'll be the quartz hitting it

94
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:11,200
through the mothership Fab EG which is

95
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,040
also always a pleasure I love the

96
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:15,238
evenness of the mothership due to these

97
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:17,639
four little points in the glass it

98
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:20,199
brings the water up completely evenly

99
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:22,120
throughout the whole pipe it almost

100
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:24,560
feels like the pipe wants to take off

101
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:26,959
this is the most amazing piece I've ever

102
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,959
hit of um I have had the opportunity to

103
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:32,478
hit this a few times and absolutely

104
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:35,519
incredible it's was like oh my god I've

105
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:36,959
never hit any piece like that and I've

106
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:40,038
hit some pretty expensive pieces

107
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:42,560
actually your old store that you had on

108
00:04:40,038 --> 00:04:46,199
Commercial Drive your gallery oh yes at

109
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,759
the the legends of bash yeah holy hey

110
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:50,160
that's going back now the legends of

111
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,600
hash was originally started in Amsterdam

112
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,680
however for the first three years that

113
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:57,280
we did it I coincided my Vancouver

114
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:59,240
gallery to do one as well so you got to

115
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:01,119
come to uh was a couple of those that's

116
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,960
awesome dude yeah those are few two of

117
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,680
them I think those are historic all

118
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:10,120
right so New York City Diesel on the

119
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:12,160
quartz slow ripping with Opus 420 at the

120
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,560
cchq it's nice to have the whole floor

121
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,840
to ourselves right now usually there's

122
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,639
quite a few people in the room and uh

123
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:20,839
I'm getting texts from Horatio saying

124
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:23,560
that he's at the door so I'm going to

125
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:25,119
let Opus tell you guys about a little

126
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,280
bit about that hit and I'm going to go

127
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,600
grab Horatio real

128
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:32,439
quick wow

129
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,800
that is uh first of all I got to say

130
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:38,319
that's quite different than hitting off

131
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:42,038
the uh titanium nail which is usually

132
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:44,360
what I do uh hit up um I use a highly

133
00:05:42,038 --> 00:05:48,038
educated nail and uh heat it up with a

134
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:49,479
butane torch I can tell you this is

135
00:05:48,038 --> 00:05:53,478
considerably

136
00:05:49,478 --> 00:05:55,240
different uh extremely smooth and clean

137
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:59,439
um now I'm not sure if that's just due

138
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:01,478
to the uh the fact that the quality of

139
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:03,279
uh what we're smoking here this this dry

140
00:06:01,478 --> 00:06:05,599
SI this wonderful Diesel doesn't that

141
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:07,359
taste unbelievable the pipe will

142
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,160
literally taste like that now for the

143
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,720
next 10 rips no matter what we put

144
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:14,199
through it oh are you kidding oh no I'm

145
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:16,440
not that's it it's obiously but the uh

146
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:18,038
again I was smoking This Mother Ship

147
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:19,918
this thing is I'm going to take a little

148
00:06:18,038 --> 00:06:22,598
incredible thing to hit now to catch up

149
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:24,198
with you sure do that this is another

150
00:06:22,598 --> 00:06:25,959
mother ship another Mothership a

151
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:28,360
straight Fab instead of blowing it out

152
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:30,239
into an egg it's just a straight and uh

153
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:33,120
this one has the silicone carbide nail

154
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,120
with the drop down

155
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,199
so this thing's almost as fun to watch

156
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:45,839
as it is to actually hit out

157
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:49,280
of just the evenness of the bubble

158
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:51,399
action is just perfect it really is it's

159
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:53,918
a pipe that deserves to be clean always

160
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:56,359
oh yes all I think any good piece of

161
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:58,120
glass deserves to be clean always

162
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:00,199
there's nothing kind of worse than and

163
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:02,280
I'm terrible for letting my pipes get

164
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:03,400
grunged up uh I have people comment all

165
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:05,159
the time they're like man that guy

166
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:07,239
smokes so much out of his out of his

167
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:09,400
pipes and they always seem to be clean

168
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:11,120
what do you clean them with uh you know

169
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:14,399
what one of my favorite cleaners to this

170
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:17,120
day is grunge off now grung off is a

171
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:19,839
product that's been um kind of is that

172
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,199
an automotive FR it really is in a sense

173
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:24,000
you can find it at Home Depot and it's

174
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:26,598
um not called grunge off but it's some

175
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,839
sort of an uh um orange no it's not

176
00:07:26,598 --> 00:07:29,959
Orange it's from the soya bean it's an

177
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:32,878
enzyme or something something and it

178
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:34,560
makes this real a soap that feels like

179
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:37,039
that you can't get off your hands it

180
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,399
makes this weird kind of so if you soak

181
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:42,038
engine grease any sort of Grease it just

182
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:43,758
peels this stuff away and overnight you

183
00:07:42,038 --> 00:07:45,478
could soak a bong and grunge off pour

184
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,639
the grunge off out rinse the pipe with

185
00:07:45,478 --> 00:07:49,800
hot water and it's clean even from Salt

186
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:51,918
residue and little hard water marks that

187
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:54,439
it leaves on the glass sometimes and the

188
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:56,038
interesting thing is you can reuse it

189
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:57,879
over and over and over again even once

190
00:07:56,038 --> 00:07:59,800
it's black and nasty and there's chunks

191
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:01,400
falling out of it much like the pur

192
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:04,240
power and those other I mean purple

193
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:06,359
Power is an ISO with sort of like a a

194
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,800
rock salt mixture in it and then they've

195
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,560
added color this is a little bit

196
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,598
different in the sense that it's an oil

197
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:14,839
it's not a solvent and that it really is

198
00:08:12,598 --> 00:08:16,038
like reusable Beyond well I was just

199
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:18,839
pointing it

200
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:21,000
reusable product that's all I was merely

201
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:24,560
pointing yeah so I mean I use grof I

202
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,800
also use alcohol is isopropanol 99% I I

203
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,319
dislike using it as much as grunge off

204
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,478
cuz I can reuse it over and over again

205
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:33,360
the alcohol as I re use it it just I

206
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:36,479
find if I use dirty alcohol it just sort

207
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:39,918
of coats the pipe and in grunch I don't

208
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:43,200
like you reusing so I although I have

209
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:46,360
reused it to uh will soak a a nasty

210
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:49,440
piece in a small bowl or something that

211
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:51,639
you know has been let go I'll soak that

212
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,839
in used stuff yeah but then I'll give it

213
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:56,759
another clean later in a fresh toally

214
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:59,920
that's what I basically so yeah soak it

215
00:08:56,759 --> 00:09:01,720
in the old crap is fine a drop down yeah

216
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:05,039
something that's hard to get clean and

217
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:06,720
uh so this one has this is a really cool

218
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:08,759
little carb cap and i' suggest that you

219
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,519
use it yourself and it just it's going

220
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:12,039
to go on top of the the Silicon there's

221
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:14,159
a little hole in the top that you can

222
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:16,519
carb actually right there right there

223
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:18,719
yeah and then uh you'll see when you're

224
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:21,679
hitting the pipe with it on there that

225
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,600
you can seal it the more you can seal it

226
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:25,239
the better rip you'll get and I mean

227
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,120
constrict it completely almost so you're

228
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:30,320
just like and you'll really get the rip

229
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:32,679
so uh okay let's do this is the silicon

230
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,920
carbide same hash not giving it Monster

231
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:36,759
rips just a nice little taste test and

232
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:38,958
remember slow and steady is going to win

233
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:38,958
this

234
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,000
race yeah move that around and you'll

235
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:46,519
kind of eventually it goes click and

236
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,759
it's like whoa it's quite an interesting

237
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:53,799
feeling how well this ID dab carb cap uh

238
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:55,559
fits onto the silicon carbide bowt

239
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:57,838
literally in at one point just

240
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:59,879
constricts so perfectly that you can't

241
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,360
even hear the pipe

242
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:04,278
barely bubbling right

243
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:07,600
now Opus

244
00:10:04,278 --> 00:10:09,720
420 this is not his first rodeo I used

245
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,879
to go visit Opus on the island and he

246
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,560
had just this beautiful grow he was

247
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:15,720
always really well known for his uh

248
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:18,399
burmes uh [ __ ] incredible or just

249
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:21,160
Burmese bures Burmese it was so good

250
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:23,200
such awesome uh strain had some

251
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:27,120
specialness to it for sure you know well

252
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:29,519
it was a beautiful fenal uh me and uh

253
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,600
myself and two of my buddies that I grew

254
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:34,360
with on the island uh the three of us

255
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:37,440
kept that string going for uh I think it

256
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:39,839
was like 11 years that one cutting

257
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,240
that's awesome yeah and uh and she

258
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:47,320
produced and

259
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:50,000
really uh was pleased a lot of people

260
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:53,720
were pretty happy with that one

261
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,799
so that was uh yeah that was actually

262
00:10:53,720 --> 00:11:00,000
Michelle rainy's second most favorite

263
00:10:55,799 --> 00:11:02,078
scen yes next to her uh next to her bull

264
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,958
rider next to the bull rider which you

265
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:08,120
know you got to give some props to um

266
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:09,638
Jeff uh to Jeff but also to Raz now a

267
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:12,560
lot of people don't know about Raz but

268
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:15,440
Raz was actually with Michelle before

269
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:16,958
Jeff and Raz um and Jeff were really

270
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,399
good friends of course you know when a

271
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:20,119
woman gets in between you can have a

272
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:23,480
little bit of a problem there which is

273
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:25,799
understandable but um he uh Raz made a

274
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:29,839
point on getting Jeff the bull rider

275
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:31,319
from San Diego so he was very crucial in

276
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,079
getting that because he knew the guys in

277
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:35,519
San Diego really well and he was able to

278
00:11:33,078 --> 00:11:38,120
get that cut Jeff took that cut and then

279
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,839
crossed it with the Afghani and came up

280
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,720
with the bull rider the Afghan bull

281
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,360
rider which he gave you know a lot of

282
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:45,399
people talked about Jeff saying he

283
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,680
wasn't sharing that strain I asked Jeff

284
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:50,320
one time for that strain and he gave it

285
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:53,000
to me within 12 hours so Props to Jeff

286
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,000
Tech for kicking down a strain that

287
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,039
seemingly people were saying was hard to

288
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,159
get it it always lets you know when

289
00:11:57,039 --> 00:11:59,639
someone really wants you to have a

290
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:01,639
strain or they don't when you you ask

291
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:04,560
them for it and you have it 12 hours

292
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:06,959
later no one has ever given me a cut

293
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:09,078
that fast in my life so Props to Jeff

294
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:11,319
Tech as well and of course rip Michelle

295
00:12:09,078 --> 00:12:13,638
we think about you daily uh gone but

296
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:15,199
never forgotten I uh I wish we were

297
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:17,039
upstairs because there's a big beautiful

298
00:12:15,198 --> 00:12:18,479
picture of you we'll uh we'll show it

299
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:20,919
over this video while we're talking

300
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:24,199
about there you go yeah we think about

301
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:26,599
you so how did you feel about that this

302
00:12:24,198 --> 00:12:28,559
uh definitely hits well first of all the

303
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:33,199
unit hits quite differently than the egg

304
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:35,239
it does and uh that card cap is that's

305
00:12:33,198 --> 00:12:37,719
something that uh is to be

306
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:40,680
experienced right you had an amazing hit

307
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:43,079
too I I was watching it like the bong's

308
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:45,958
not making any sound right now I slowed

309
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:49,000
that went down like I was like okay I

310
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:51,039
I'm a champion B hitter I smoke a pipe

311
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,559
all the time I'm a regular pipe smoker

312
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:55,599
so I'm used to smoking a pipe right so I

313
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:58,679
understand the whole point of

314
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,399
controlling the your to and not like all

315
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:02,198
the time so you don't you know people

316
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,000
are always like taking a to off the pipe

317
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:05,759
and like choking on it like go no no you

318
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,559
can't smoke it like a joint you got to

319
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:10,559
take it easy pull right you're just

320
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:12,518
going to hurt yourself slow they're like

321
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:14,159
like they're trying that the wonder why

322
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:17,879
they're coughing and you're packing nugs

323
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:19,399
in there too so to go slow with I mean I

324
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:21,559
haven't done I remember when I've grind

325
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:23,000
an her been putting in ground hers right

326
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:25,039
when I first met marbl Slinger he was

327
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,559
like all East Coast guy putting the the

328
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:28,198
big buds in the bowl and he just

329
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:31,119
couldn't wrap his head around that I

330
00:13:28,198 --> 00:13:32,399
couldn't wrap my head around that right

331
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,320
I was just like I was already getting

332
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:37,879
into at that point really being a

333
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:41,000
full-blown hashish guy so well actually

334
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:44,360
when I got into the uh Bubble Bags doing

335
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,399
water hash um it's going back and yeah

336
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:48,480
and I was actually making uh the bubble

337
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,799
with the burmes and also with uh some

338
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,560
Island sweet skunk that I was growing

339
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:56,198
out and I had to actually make a rule

340
00:13:53,559 --> 00:14:00,159
that I wouldn't smoke the 73 Micron

341
00:13:56,198 --> 00:14:03,078
bubble before 5:00 right right otherwise

342
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:05,319
because I had this this double bubbler

343
00:14:03,078 --> 00:14:07,359

YouTube mcmah and that's my YouTube

361
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:53,879
channel it was uh previously Opus 420

362
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,839
but they made me change it really yeah

363
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:58,720
it was all that issues with the Google

364
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:00,720
and you know real names and oh wow

365
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,000
various problems like that and since I

366
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,040
already had 900 followers on the one

367
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,039
channel I had set up another and then

368
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:10,360
it's all kind of was confusing but it's

369
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:13,159
the one where you'll see a picture of me

370
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:15,680
and uh it's a closeup straight on head

371
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:17,799
shot yep and where I'm actually split in

372
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:20,000
half and one side of me is me and the

373
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:23,519
other half and I'm looking like uh doing

374
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,639
my impression of um Heisenberg from

375
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:28,318
Breaking Bad ah Heisenberg we've all

376
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,759
done our impression of Heisenberg well

377
00:15:28,318 --> 00:15:33,519
my good friend Goodwood actually uh

378
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:35,639
cropped that picture in half oh really

379
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:39,198
yeah with a picture of uh the actor

380
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:42,079
there cranon um yeah Brian Brian cranon

381
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:44,399

382
00:15:42,078 --> 00:15:46,679
him in the picture like the picture

383
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,879
actually does it was like oh my God like

384
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:50,159
so it's kind of

385
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:51,720
funny so but that's how you know you're

386
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:54,318
on the right YouTube channel look at

387
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:56,278
that wow literally that just broke in my

388
00:15:54,318 --> 00:15:57,639
hands that was the glass yeah that's

389
00:15:56,278 --> 00:16:00,480

390
00:15:57,639 --> 00:16:03,198
work all right all right here we go

391
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:05,360
mildly disappointed but still ready for

392
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:05,359
a

393
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:19,040
dab I about like it better as a

394
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:25,439
stubby yeah it didn't take off a

395
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:29,439
functional piece really so that was the

396
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:31,160
Goji ogi and that was

397
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,680
completely a different taste profile

398
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:35,000
from uh what we just finished hitting

399
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:36,758
the New York City Diesel there if you

400

to happen yet but we've uh hinted at it

502
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,919
so yeah hopefully that'll it'll be

503
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:11,240
something that occurs and we can all get

504
00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:13,640
together and dab ourselves

505
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:17,159
silly what do you think of the 2D Now

506
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:19,080
set up oh man that the wood the wood car

507
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:20,960
reminds me of old school the old kit my

508
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:23,918
parents bought me when you right pulled

509
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:26,278
out the wood burning kit yeah know it's

510
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:29,080
pretty sweet when we used to get things

511
00:21:26,278 --> 00:21:32,000
like that as kids would burn wood

512
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:34,359
burning kit and the lawn darts and we

513
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,880
had all the safe toys as children Barb

514
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:39,319
was spectacular by the way oh nice yeah

515
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:43,440
that tasted great right off the courtz

516
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:43,439
water hash too wow

517
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:48,759
were what's

518
00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:50,839
that you want to hit something before I

519
00:21:48,759 --> 00:21:52,839
go hit something before I go why are you

520
00:21:50,839 --> 00:21:56,480
leaving right now got to go I got to get

521
00:21:52,839 --> 00:21:58,839
going yeah I I got to catch the the

522
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:01,400
flight maybe you should uh hit hit

523
00:21:58,839 --> 00:22:02,639
something on your way out a little Barb

524
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:05,798
or the Seven

525
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:08,600
Star let try that this one here that

526
00:22:05,798 --> 00:22:10,599
one's uh five star this that's just you

527
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:12,639
could say regular what do you mean by

528
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:14,038
five star I guess it was just my regular

529
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,480
best 10

530
00:22:14,038 --> 00:22:18,038
Stars I didn't know either bizar

531
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,880
Brothers down in California have a

532
00:22:18,038 --> 00:22:21,759
rating system that they rate their full

533
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,600
m hash and they kind of created it for

534
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:25,480
their own a hash making but then they

535
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:27,240
have a little spot where people would

536
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:29,278
come and you could buy hash and enjoy it

537
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:32,000
at their little spot there it was based

538
00:22:29,278 --> 00:22:34,759
on a star rating and basically like the

539
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,599
superb like full full full melt drip

540
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:39,480
right through the screen that's a six he

541
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:42,918
just came up with the Seven Star

542
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:44,720
recently their systemar the seven star

543
00:22:42,919 --> 00:22:47,480
is manmade like was that was that a

544
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:50,079
title like bestowed on you of sort of

545
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:52,558
seven star status it is one of those

546
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:54,558
things that when you've defined it you

547
00:22:52,558 --> 00:22:57,599
have to be able to isolate TPS in order

548
00:22:54,558 --> 00:23:00,798
to create SAR he put back TPS that would

549
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:02,480
otherwise be lost in the drying process

550
00:23:00,798 --> 00:23:05,000
so he's collecting those turps out of

551
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:07,640
fresh plants and then reconstituting

552
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,519
them back into the dry sift at a

553
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:13,600
particular ratio Seven Star Seven Star

554
00:23:10,519 --> 00:23:16,400
it's attempt at the wet dry it's what

555
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:18,119
fresh frozen on the carbide nail on the

556
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:21,320
carbide nail excited to use the carbide

557
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:24,319
nail as excited as I am to hit Seven

558
00:23:21,319 --> 00:23:28,519
Star there you go what better way to hit

559
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:28,519
the Seven Star than off the carbide

560
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,038
that's just

561
00:23:40,759 --> 00:23:46,319
nice bummed that she broke but she broke

562
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:47,960
so perfect I can still dab with her no I

563
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:51,200
know other than the fact that there's

564
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:54,400
broken remnants of her on the table

565
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:57,600
therea clean my nose is

566
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:59,519
tickling it's the actual strain cuz I

567
00:23:57,599 --> 00:24:02,319
did that I made it in the LA I'm like oh

568
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:05,359
my God I got nose pickle this is bad and

569
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:08,639
it's the actual uh tpine profile of that

570
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:10,839
MK Ultra so I really want to go back

571
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,720
into the the alcohol and the water turps

572
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:15,558
and pretty much figure out where in The

573
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:18,120
Taste did that profile go cuz I remember

574
00:24:15,558 --> 00:24:20,079
you had noticed orange in the alcohol

575
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:22,199
but not in the water and I was like I

576
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:24,960
wonder where that Citrus lies in the

577
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:27,000
final product if it's pretty much saying

578
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,720
I'm only in this jar so cuz he's got the

579
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,839
hydrol like the alcohol tpin and the

580
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:35,640
water tpin as well my are you doing a

581
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:38,519
steam distillation just with the that

582
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:42,159
would turn all the plant material into

583
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:44,558
spinach if you if you no plant material

584
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:48,159
like just the with the wash

585
00:24:44,558 --> 00:24:50,639
from the bubble bags that goes through

586
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:51,880
like essentially the hydro the hydrol I

587
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,080
don't think people are trying to collect

588
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:55,880
it from water well with the when you try

589
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:57,480
to collect the hydrol the first problem

590
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,799
is it's filthy so what do you put in the

591
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:01,159
plant what's you together put the plant

592
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:03,639
into a solution you extracting that well

593
00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:06,278
hold on hold on hold on I'm questions

594
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:09,120
look I'm getting the eyes over here like

595
00:25:06,278 --> 00:25:11,200
going too deep I'm liking it go deep

596
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:12,319
well it's um what it is is reveal the

597
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,120
secret well what it is is you're like

598
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:14,079
you're asking over here and you're

599
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:15,079

600
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:17,599
minute are we talking about the bubble

601
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:22,119
hash water we talking basically you

602
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:24,079
could you 331 tell now he's got a flight

603
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:26,558
to catch the best we can do is we can

604
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:31,240
clean the bubble hash water to this so

605
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:31,240
that's mku water yeah

606
00:25:31,398 --> 00:25:35,719
what oh I got some on there it's all

607
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:37,640
right it's all right he drinks it it's

608
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:40,720
all right that one's the alcohol it's

609
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:41,799
the hyp so try that or snip that and

610
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,200
snip the

611
00:25:41,798 --> 00:25:46,480
alcohol this is a special occasion see

612
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:49,759
this one smells this one sort of smells

613
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:51,159
like like uh that's got a cushy smell

614
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:53,000
though this one smells like you're doing

615
00:25:51,159 --> 00:25:54,559
like bubble hat or something then you're

616
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,640
like your water's running through the

617
00:25:54,558 --> 00:25:59,519
screens yeah this one smells like that

618
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:01,278
fresh like oh it's the resin yeah so if

619
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:03,440
you taste this where does the taste

620
00:26:01,278 --> 00:26:09,359
compared to the smell come off tast it

621
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:09,360
go for it m al water

622
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:12,960
Tes how's

623
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:20,960
that and then compare it to the mku

624
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:25,918
alcohol alcohol which I I'm flying not

625
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,919
driving turpins modulators

626
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:35,080
I don't drink alcohol come on no I don't

627
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:36,839
that's why I give it to people to taste

628
00:26:35,079 --> 00:26:38,759
I'm like I don't know how much alcohol

629
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:41,519
in this is but I can't drink

630
00:26:38,759 --> 00:26:44,599
0.5 booze basically alcohol-free booze I

631
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:46,918
can't touch right so I basically if I

632
00:26:44,599 --> 00:26:49,439
take about half of this and mix it in a

633
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:50,919
whole bottle of soda then I can drink it

634
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,360
and it tastes

635
00:26:50,919 --> 00:26:55,399
insane uh the up strrretch on this is

636
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:57,959
insane the water turps are great they're

637
00:26:55,398 --> 00:26:59,558
still like tasting strong on my lips and

638
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:04,278
T I don't know but that one that one

639
00:26:59,558 --> 00:27:04,278
sort of right in the face so this

640
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:08,079
is all a sudden it just sort of like

641
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,480
that sort of like hit me in the back of

642
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:12,678
the throat and sort of washed me forward

643
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,640
this is the one I'm hoping I possibly

644
00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:16,919
could get back out of the bubble hash

645
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,440
water but the honest truth is I'm not

646
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:21,038
working with bubble hash water so I

647
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:22,320
would have to have the opportunity's

648
00:27:21,038 --> 00:27:24,038
what are you putting here full plan

649
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:28,759
solution

650
00:27:24,038 --> 00:27:30,759
into that is uh question the 20 m dollar

651
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:33,679
question I guess the best way of putting

652
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:34,679
it is I am using water to get them um

653
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:36,840
it's so you're just putting a whole

654
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:40,600
plant in the water freezing it putting

655
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:43,000
the whole plant in the water no that's

656
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:44,359
um that that if I even kind of hinted

657
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,240
that that was the I'd be leading you in

658
00:27:44,359 --> 00:27:48,798
the wrong direction um if anything I'm

659
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:51,159
taking advantage of the water that's in

660
00:27:48,798 --> 00:27:52,038
the plant and where it is in the plant

661
00:27:51,159 --> 00:27:54,840
I'm not

662
00:27:52,038 --> 00:27:56,599
at so I'm using the pressing it coal

663
00:27:54,839 --> 00:28:00,038
pressing it well no I'm only going to

664
00:27:56,599 --> 00:28:03,519
give so much what I can give is me so

665
00:28:00,038 --> 00:28:06,240
much I absolutely using the water that

666
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:07,919
is within the tag me on my Instagram at

667
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,319
Great Gardener if you think he's using

668
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:12,159

669
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:15,639
discussion look at these guys they're

670

717
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:04,278
our conversation which we were uh in the

718
00:30:02,359 --> 00:30:06,558
middle of kind of continuing with Matt

719
00:30:04,278 --> 00:30:08,640
Matt was uh really pressing on Horatio

720
00:30:06,558 --> 00:30:11,240
to see how he does things of course

721
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:13,200
Horatio hasn't finished how he does

722
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:14,640
things he's in the middle of discovering

723
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,360
how he does things so it's a little bit

724
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,399
hard to uh each week is different you

725
00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:20,879
see this consistent nothing like last

726
00:30:18,398 --> 00:30:22,398
week's Seven Star so I mean is that I'm

727
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,240
starting with this week's Seven Star how

728
00:30:22,398 --> 00:30:27,439
about that check out right into it this

729
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:32,720
is the MK yep and so Seven Star this is

730
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:35,519
dry that uh Horatio has readded um tpin

731
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:38,720
that he's extracted from the plant using

732
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:40,399
uh a technique know well I mean the M

733
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,399
the main thing to really emphasize is

734
00:30:40,398 --> 00:30:45,359
from the same material that derived the

735
00:30:42,398 --> 00:30:47,759
dry SI cuz obviously when you imagine

736
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:50,519
some people have an infinite amount of

737
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:52,558
uh plant material they can uh produce

738
00:30:50,519 --> 00:30:55,599
effects that um aren't necessarily you

739
00:30:52,558 --> 00:30:59,000
could say um industrial standard or a

740
00:30:55,599 --> 00:31:01,839
process so um my real goal is been

741
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:05,200
I these TPS that we're looking at right

742
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:08,000
here came from those heads that uh we're

743
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:09,880
smoking on and they just returned to

744
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,278
their Source after it's properly been

745
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:15,519
dried which is naturally what needs to

746
00:31:12,278 --> 00:31:16,960
be done in order to sit excellent very

747
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:19,278
cool let me give a little Whi this is

748
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:21,360
the mku yeah

749
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:23,119
oil you got to be so careful when

750
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:26,558
opening a v like this it's very

751
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:28,439
Priceless in a sense on I can't recreate

752
00:31:26,558 --> 00:31:30,918
it's yeah it's just it's very very few

753
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:33,360
drops you certainly don't want to uh

754
00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:35,679
it's the perfume it's the the the pure

755
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:39,240
essence of the of the plant minus the

756
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:41,200
phyto can abono mhm tarpine

757
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:43,638
delicious so do you want to taste that

758
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:47,519
off the sil car or did you want to taste

759
00:31:43,638 --> 00:31:50,359
it off the silicone carbide here a real

760
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:55,159
easy method to do that oh

761
00:31:50,359 --> 00:31:58,199
yeah is the nail comes up

762
00:31:55,159 --> 00:32:00,799
go so

763
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,798
put that

764
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:17,600
there slider there that out of your

765
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:21,199
way I love uh how I can change these

766
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:22,798
nails in mid use especially with

767
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,000
obviously if this one had the drop down

768
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:26,278
it would be even

769
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,880
easier so you're going to give a rip on

770
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:31,519
that did this uh

771
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:33,799
did this white out or I'm just kind of

772
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:36,079
pressing it I never really know well I

773
00:32:33,798 --> 00:32:39,359
mean the the I wondered what the

774
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:41,240
final preserved end would be if you do

775
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:42,918
reintroduce what is naturally a part of

776
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:45,919
The Preserve you have to remove this to

777
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:48,159
preserve it so if I reintroduce it what

778
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:50,840
is the end result are we is this

779
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:53,320
basically now a fresh seasonal only know

780
00:32:50,839 --> 00:32:56,599
we know that tping can act as a solvent

781
00:32:53,319 --> 00:32:58,759
so if it was a a fraction of pure

782
00:32:56,599 --> 00:33:01,480
turkins it would be one thing we be able

783
00:32:58,759 --> 00:33:03,278
to which ones were which but because

784
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:06,000
it's a profile of tpin you'd have to get

785
00:33:03,278 --> 00:33:08,839
it tested and find out what in here

786
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,919
could potentially act to break down the

787
00:33:08,839 --> 00:33:14,079
yeah cuz this definitely even in the

788
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:16,278
fact it wasn't as you could say um live

789
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:19,199
resin like as last week it definitely

790
00:33:16,278 --> 00:33:20,960
seems to make a different style of cake

791
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,159
and that may just be the amount of resin

792
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:25,000
heads left in it sure the wax sure

793
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:27,000
melted out beautifully and took on the

794
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,759
the proper look when I hit when it hit

795
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,759
the nail that's

796
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:40,719
she stuck for a while now she's boiling

797
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:43,079
was interesting

798
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:45,639
here this what really makes the size of

799
00:33:43,079 --> 00:33:49,319
this nail much uh thought I was going to

800
00:33:45,638 --> 00:33:49,319
tip you over there pull you right

801
00:33:50,638 --> 00:33:54,918
down so starting with the seven star is

802
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:56,200
always a great way to start uh uh an

803
00:33:54,919 --> 00:33:57,960
episode with

804
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,399
Horatio even though we're kind kind of

805
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,798
in the middle of an episode right now as

806
00:33:59,398 --> 00:34:03,599
we've already talked to Matt the great

807
00:34:00,798 --> 00:34:06,119
Gardener and we've talked to Opus

808
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:07,638
420 and uh yeah now we're just going to

809
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:09,159
continue on with a great little session

810
00:34:07,638 --> 00:34:12,279
you got your hydrosols your water

811
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:15,159
soluble your water Turin yeah so now

812
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:18,320
your pure trines yeah just I'm always

813
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:20,240
because these don't go back so this

814
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,119
alcohol portion is always fractured out

815
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:25,319
that's kind of I always wanted to know

816
00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:28,760
if do you smell any of that portion in

817
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:31,720
the actual um the heads cuz this has

818
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,720
always been the most

819
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:38,599
unique now if you want which one did you

820
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:41,158
just grab the MK Ultra without the turps

821
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:43,399
yeah I had both or the Bubba king sorry

822
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:45,039
oh bubble King yeah which the last time

823
00:34:43,398 --> 00:34:46,759
I had this the first time I had seven

824
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:49,279
star it was Bubba King it was death

825
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:53,320
Bubba oh sorry death Bubba right yeah so

826
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:53,320
now here's a

827
00:34:53,440 --> 00:35:03,000
pure got a nice uh texture to it that's

828
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:03,000
sure little gooey and

829
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,760
gummy

830
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:15,519
thing well I mean because I'm in the you

831
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:18,000
could say the experimenting Arts of

832
00:35:15,519 --> 00:35:20,400
preserving I'm getting to see uh what

833
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,880
the consequences are on the different

834
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:25,280
the different heads the different melts

835
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:27,200
um you know kind of I haven't done much

836
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:30,680
macro lately just because I've been so

837
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:33,838
busy but um I really wish I could uh

838
00:35:30,679 --> 00:35:35,919
start macroing the stages of here it is

839
00:35:33,838 --> 00:35:38,119
now I just touched it here it is after a

840
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,440
week cuz typically when I make it I seal

841
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:43,079
it and then I freeze it and you're

842
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:44,679
usually out of the country until now so

843
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:47,039
I kind of Let It Go for a weak cure in

844
00:35:44,679 --> 00:35:49,919
the freezer to see what what that

845
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:51,318
natural process will do well I'm going

846
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:55,119
to be leaving the country again really

847
00:35:51,318 --> 00:35:58,599
soon here head back to Jamaica go check

848
00:35:55,119 --> 00:36:00,519
out um the high the it called the I keep

849
00:35:58,599 --> 00:36:03,000
forgetting the name each time but it's a

850
00:36:00,519 --> 00:36:04,800
Rass Bobby's putting on a cup in neg

851
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,239
Grill so I'm going to go down there and

852
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,560
judge that and speak on a panel and then

853
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:10,000
we're going to do the neutr cutical

854
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:12,039
conference in

855
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,480
Kingston should all be good stuff I'm

856
00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:15,559
looking forward to it and the soccer

857
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:16,800
match which I've mentioned a few times

858
00:36:15,559 --> 00:36:19,599
and I'll probably mention a few more

859
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:21,160
times posted the soccer match poster on

860
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:23,800
my Facebook page if you want to check it

861
00:36:21,159 --> 00:36:25,799
out it's worth checking out it's like

862
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:28,119
the Kingston artists versus the St

863
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,839
Catherine artists playing a big football

864
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:34,039
match G to be serious and then the other

865
00:36:29,838 --> 00:36:36,400
one is the Jamaican con conary Force

866
00:36:34,039 --> 00:36:39,159
versus the Spanish

867
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:42,639
youth the youths of Spanish Town the

868
00:36:39,159 --> 00:36:45,118
youths of Spanish Town versus the

869
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:46,639
Jamaican it's going to be good soccer

870
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:48,960
yeah it's going to be good man it's

871
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:51,920
going to be pretty uh a lot of Pride

872
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:55,240
getting thrown about

873
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:58,358
right there this is next week's strain

874
00:36:55,239 --> 00:37:01,000
it hasn't been sifted uh

875
00:36:58,358 --> 00:37:03,239
the MK you kind of uh it's the first

876
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:06,599
time I've ever crashed my screens pretty

877
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:08,879
much is what I'd like to call it you you

878
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:12,119
finally make I thought I had environment

879
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:14,760
under control I thought I had strains I

880
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:17,000
thought I knew variables but this mku is

881
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:19,240
pretty much probably the closest thing

882
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,880
if I've never sifted the Barb but I

883
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:23,959
would imagine it must be a day like this

884
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:27,079
on the races

885
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:31,280
where yeah today today was my fail Tech

886
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:35,760
uh 15° C average room temperature no

887
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:38,280
dice no dice and um once I saw it and I

888
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:40,760
saw I'm like whoa that's I can see my

889
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:42,519
hand shape in the screen I'm like okay

890
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:46,040
this is this is going to be some of my

891
00:37:42,519 --> 00:37:47,280
best sift whatever I get back but um

892
00:37:46,039 --> 00:37:48,440
needed to work in a much colder

893
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:51,280
environment

894
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:53,240
obviously whatever whatever soft was

895
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:57,720
soft whatever these I've always been

896
00:37:53,239 --> 00:38:00,559
able to work the mku pretty much

897
00:37:57,719 --> 00:38:03,759
recently what I think is I looked at it

898
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:06,838
here's the thing you will see many many

899
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:09,440
many different differences in the resin

900
00:38:06,838 --> 00:38:11,719
over years and even decades well when I

901
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:13,159
first started these res I was like this

902
00:38:11,719 --> 00:38:15,000
is awesome and I'm like whoa whoa whoa

903
00:38:13,159 --> 00:38:16,920
wait buddy as soon as you think you're

904
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,760
awesome that's when you're going to get

905
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:21,400
your ass handed to cuz someone will say

906
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:23,440
well then SI the bag of this and you're

907
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:25,160
so for instance in my case if someone

908
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,480
comes up to me and they oh I just

909
00:38:25,159 --> 00:38:28,279
learned to this I did I'm like I got

910
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:30,960
some mku for you

911
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:33,119
uh let's see what you got going cuz

912
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:35,280
that's what I mean these Bubba King

913
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:39,079
these are soft and I'm an environmental

914
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:41,839
controls guy this

915
00:38:39,079 --> 00:38:43,599
mku it is re that's kind of why I'm

916
00:38:41,838 --> 00:38:46,559
wondering now I'm like is this the

917
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:48,720
equivalent of the Barb where is the Barb

918
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:50,559
have you ever had a bad days race with

919
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:54,679
the Barb when it comes to

920
00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:54,679
sifting and you got to admit that is

921
00:38:55,679 --> 00:39:00,919
insane expect to get this through screen

922
00:38:58,159 --> 00:39:03,799
that's well I know that's not even the

923
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:07,400
dry set it is

924
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:09,119
go damn love the Barb I got a Barb

925
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:13,000
blooming in my tent right now as well as

926
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:15,559
a gg1 The Afghani from uh great Gardener

927
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,318
both of those are maybe a week away from

928
00:39:15,559 --> 00:39:18,920
me cutting them down and running them

929
00:39:17,318 --> 00:39:20,119
through the bags they're not huge plants

930
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:22,159
they're not going to have an enormous

931
00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:26,000
amount of resin on them but I'll get

932
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:30,598
some grams of each one

933
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:36,639
EXC dar excited yeah so I guess looking

934
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:39,000
at um like I said M KU is by far the

935
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:41,039
most difficult I've ever touched and I

936
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,719
looked at what I thought yeah that's

937
00:39:41,039 --> 00:39:44,159
pretty difficult but I can handle it my

938
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:47,078
environment can handle it my skills can

939
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:48,879
handle it my patience can handle it so

940
00:39:47,079 --> 00:39:51,680
the other guy's going to [ __ ] up but

941
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,800
today was my day it's one of those

942
00:39:51,679 --> 00:39:56,239
things where I'm like okay I didn't [ __ ]

943
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:57,880
up I did I did get out but I didn't like

944
00:39:56,239 --> 00:39:59,598
how

945
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:02,358
I I couldn't work as fast as I wanted to

946
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:05,960
work I couldn't I wasn't in control I

947
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:09,960
was in heed of the strain that's kind of

948
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:13,280
where so where would if I was to smell a

949
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:15,079
bag and anticipate a day's work could

950
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:18,160
would you say follow the turps in my

951
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:20,760
nose to how the profile or would it be

952
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:22,799
by um more the genetics no I would say

953
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:24,640
that if you're going to be making sift

954
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,440
on the regular or even not on the

955
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:27,759
regular but here and there that you're

956
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:29,960
just going to want to understand the

957
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:32,640
importance of controlling the variable

958
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:35,280
that is the temperature of your room and

959
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:38,159
that warmth is the enemy even when it

960
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:39,680
might not seem that warm to you resin

961
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:42,000
reacts very differently to the

962
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:44,199
atmospheric changes like humidity and

963
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,119
temperatures if you can just make it

964
00:40:44,199 --> 00:40:48,519
like lower the humidity and lower the

965
00:40:46,119 --> 00:40:50,559
temperature resin suddenly becomes like

966
00:40:48,519 --> 00:40:54,480
a dream to

967
00:40:50,559 --> 00:40:55,960
work it's that's kind you see the stress

968
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:59,280
in my voice cuz I'm like I do those

969
00:40:55,960 --> 00:41:02,599
things I'm in control I know how to I

970
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:03,599
control the resin and that's kind of why

971
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:06,960
I

972
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:09,760
like like I said I made but I realize

973
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:11,720
I'm like oh my gosh if some poor bastard

974
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:13,200
and it's your and you think you're going

975
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:14,358
to clean up something and this is what

976
00:41:13,199 --> 00:41:17,679
you come

977
00:41:14,358 --> 00:41:20,199
across you are not there's you have to

978
00:41:17,679 --> 00:41:24,000
build my room to suck to suck like me at

979
00:41:20,199 --> 00:41:26,199
it right this is um I kind of wish we

980
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,318
started to kind of develop a list it's

981
00:41:26,199 --> 00:41:29,799
usually when you hear oh it sared on me

982
00:41:28,318 --> 00:41:31,838
I'm like it's your environment dude but

983
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:33,200
I'm like okay this bypassed my

984
00:41:31,838 --> 00:41:36,480
environment and that environment has

985
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:39,598
worked for everything well once people

986
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:43,119
have a a larger knowledge of what's

987
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:45,640
going on such as like the proton hm

988
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:47,920
these different forms of testing for

989
00:41:45,639 --> 00:41:49,759
different things you know then then

990
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:52,318
it'll be a little bit more solid in the

991
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:55,680
sense like okay we know that

992
00:41:52,318 --> 00:41:58,079
this these canids were in there yeah cuz

993
00:41:55,679 --> 00:42:00,358
right now if you literally

994
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:02,800
if someone just said this is a sift off

995
00:42:00,358 --> 00:42:05,519
um sift for your life and smell the bag

996
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:07,680
you want to work with um that's kind of

997
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:09,519
why I'm like okay wait a minute this has

998
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:11,239
been a rough day what can I smell in

999
00:42:09,519 --> 00:42:14,239
this that I can smell in the Barb I know

1000
00:42:11,239 --> 00:42:16,639
the Barb is hard work is it a fruity

1001
00:42:14,239 --> 00:42:18,439
tone is it a there's almost sometimes A

1002
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:20,440
Min when it's a good cush it's a

1003
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:23,480
minerally kind of

1004
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:26,000
um I can't I can't T it just it's like a

1005
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:27,719
a mineral good kind of smell and um I

1006
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,800
don't know if it's that cush so

1007
00:42:27,719 --> 00:42:31,399
been trying to find similarities where

1008
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:33,640
I'm like I know that fruity taste I

1009
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:35,720
smell it in the bar whether it's Lola

1010
00:42:33,639 --> 00:42:38,799
whatever it may be you find it in the

1011
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:42,159
testing before we get a test I want to

1012
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:44,440
know this is going to happen cuz I was

1013
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:46,480
lucky enough I can push a button I can

1014
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:48,599
get through but I'd love to know that's

1015
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,838
going to happen by smell because I feel

1016
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:51,880
like there were guys that could do that

1017
00:42:49,838 --> 00:42:55,480
on experience they kind of they could

1018
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:56,960
smell the bag they could just have that

1019
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:58,400
sense of what kind of days work it was

1020
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,880
cuz

1021
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:02,760
when I was um luckily I can experience

1022
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:04,559
the fresh plant so I knew people were

1023
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:06,640
having trouble trimming it I could see

1024
00:43:04,559 --> 00:43:08,000
it in the scissors and I'm like okay

1025
00:43:06,639 --> 00:43:09,400
it's showing up in the scissors showing

1026
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,679
up in the SI it's showing up in the LA

1027
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:15,519
CH it's in this strain I can count on

1028
00:43:12,679 --> 00:43:17,399
that but that's not a science to say

1029
00:43:15,519 --> 00:43:20,039
that shows up guaranteed someone else

1030
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:21,880
could grow that strain you don't see it

1031
00:43:20,039 --> 00:43:24,558
well that's what that's what I mean cuz

1032
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:26,760
if I don't see it and it's a real clone

1033
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:28,079
that means it's really in the news and

1034
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:29,440
that's cuz that's what I'm getting a

1035
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:31,839
sense of I'm like I've had a few of

1036
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:33,960
those where I'm like okay organic versus

1037
00:43:31,838 --> 00:43:35,480
inorganic certain things turned out the

1038
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:37,480
same the flesh was the same but the

1039
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:40,719
nutrients were way different and I'm

1040
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:43,838
like wow the one that was on Commercial

1041
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:45,318
nudes it every description online that's

1042
00:43:43,838 --> 00:43:47,838
what it read like I'm like wow you

1043
00:43:45,318 --> 00:43:50,239
really taste like um the Kool-Aid

1044
00:43:47,838 --> 00:43:51,838
packaging says um everyone's description

1045
00:43:50,239 --> 00:43:54,759
of it but then when I tried the organic

1046
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:57,358
one I was like wow this is a lie this is

1047
00:43:54,760 --> 00:44:00,800
like the LIE version juice that late

1048
00:43:57,358 --> 00:44:03,358
with Bas off cuz I really like that

1049
