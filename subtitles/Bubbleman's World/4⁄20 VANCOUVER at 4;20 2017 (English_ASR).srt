on this marble I went right into the

50
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:05,679
pattern with the camera and you wouldn't

51
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:08,318
have believed what it looked

52

00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:15,840
and it's it's a little bit harder to uh

55
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:17,878
focus on the St on the stacking look at

56
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,519

57
00:03:17,878 --> 00:03:23,079
time that goes into that W it just went
