you know I get that hash Church

120
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:36,119
especially because it's so connected to

121
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:38,680
me has always been very much I think a

122
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,759
lot of people just assume it's really uh

123
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,240
like a solventless show and that we're

124
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:43,800
all about solventless this and

125
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,960
solventless that and yes I've been

126
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:49,120
guilty over the years for being a biased

127
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:50,719
prick towards solventless extraction uh

128
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,720
but I love that you guys have been

129

pushing the boundaries uh and uh really

130
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:58,440
expanding what can and can't be done uh

131
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:00,639
with the use of solvent extractions and

132

00:06:31,478 --> 00:06:35,758
of you guys are but I thought you know

169
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:37,360
what I still wanted them in the room Sam

170
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,840
always just has the most incredible

171
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,280
perspective and he's certainly uh you

172
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:44,000
know probably going to tell us a bunch

173
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:45,918
of stuff about solvent extraction that I

174
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,918
didn't even know that he was involved in

175
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:49,879
because I've never mentioned anything

176
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:52,478
that Sam wasn't involved in since the

177
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:54,000
actual beginning so uh welcome to you Mr

178

what that is

181
00:07:00,598 --> 00:07:04,360
definitely when I hear howdy howdy I

182
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:06,399

add one more don't worry just one more

197
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:41,359
oh we got a couple more people that that

198
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:43,319
are going to come in I think we have

199
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:46,158
about 25 people that are going to come

200
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:48,400
in here today so um I'm not sure how

201
00:07:46,158 --> 00:07:50,360
Mark wants to start it I would love to

202
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:52,918
get some introductions from some of you

203
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:55,080
guys I mean I'm familiar with uh with

204
00:07:52,918 --> 00:07:57,359
some of your guys' work I obviously know

205
00:07:55,079 --> 00:08:00,158
Murphy Murray and I know Adam Temple and

206
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,560
some some of you others I don't know so

207

what do you think Mark while you guys

208
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,120
are getting yourself organized over

209
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:06,959
there do you think we should maybe go

210
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,158
through a short little introduction of

211
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:11,519
everyone that's on the panel yeah

212

221
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,519
you like trust me you're here okay so to

222

my right here we have trainer we all

223
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,278
remember trainer from you our

224
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,000
solventless episode trainer is one of

225
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:48,759
the best hash makers here in the state

226
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:52,360
of Vermont and we got the one and only

227
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:55,278
kind Bill ah the kindest of bills the

228
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:57,320
kindest of bills yeah the kind kindest

229
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:59,600
of those maybe we'll see if we can cut

230
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,920
the lights a little bit but why don't we

231
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,920
start so immediately to my right I have

232
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:07,559
Eric Ward Eric you want to introduce

233
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:10,039
yourself yeah um I'm Eric Ward I uh I

234
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:13,199
guess I would be known for um starting

235
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:15,399
the liquid thca separation from back in

236
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,200
the day called uh used to call it the

237
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:19,799
Heisenberg so kind of called myself the

238
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,160
Heisenberg there for a second and then

239
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:24,679
uh we start holy water right yeah then

240
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:26,399
we started calling holy water uh we were

241
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:28,439
doing the Heisenberg thing on fish tour

242
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,159
and kind of just selling carts like the

243
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:33,200
coil carts before there were actually

244
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:35,879
carts and then kind of got known by that

245
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,320
and a little before that um and then

246
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:40,799
yeah holy water which was uh the first

247
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:43,079
liquid that we brought out to High Times

248
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:46,559
Cup in Denver that first legal one in

249
00:09:43,078 --> 00:09:47,879
420 and um kind of had to have to have

250
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:49,479
to talk to their lawyers to get them to

251
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:51,000
change the packaging for the contest and

252
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:54,959
everything because no one had ever seen

253
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,440
like a thin liquid like that and uh

254
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:59,518
that's kind of where I started I'm up in

255
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:01,839
Washington now at a company called um uh

256
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,519
sungrown we do Brands called fullspec

257
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:06,480
and we do rosin and solventless stuff

258
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:08,759
called solar rare

259
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,480
and we have a lot of different lines uh

260
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:13,439
Lea Works would be another brand um it's

261
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:16,519
kind of where I'm at these days and just

262
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,519
do some Consulting and lab stuff um a

263
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:20,679
lot of R&amp;D so I'm working with a lot of

264
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:23,759
new stuff working with the resonator

265
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:28,000
guys and doing key runs of BHO and Shout

266
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:30,278
Out TJ yeah shout out to TJ and um so

267
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,600
I'm kind of proving the the methods of

268
00:10:30,278 --> 00:10:35,078
that and have done quite an extensive

269
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:37,120
R&amp;D thing with that and now I'm doing we

270
00:10:35,078 --> 00:10:39,239
have a machine that does solventless

271
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,959
turps so we're actually able to get

272
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,039
turps with no steam distillation or no

273
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:44,759
anything like that and we just are able

274
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:46,679
to do solventless turps and so I'm doing

275
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:47,720
R&amp;D with that right now which has been

276
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:50,599
pretty

277
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:52,240
interesting dude I love I love that I

278
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,480
listen I always thought the solventless

279
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,120
term was hilarious and shout out to Nick

280
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,079
for coming up with it because it was so

281
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:01,120
necessary and whatnot but solventless

282
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:02,638
turps I know got to be the most awesome

283
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,600
like that

284
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:08,039
is solventless hydrocarbons man we got

285
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,680
the solventless hydrocarbons but guess

286
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:10,919
it's a method yeah it's a method thing

287
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:12,958
where it's like we're not using solvents

288
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:14,879
to extract ter well I know exactly what

289
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:17,679
you mean dude I know exactly what you

290
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:19,838
mean and I'm just using water which is a

291
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:21,519
solv yeah yeah exactly oh man listen I

292
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:25,079

yeah so also from the Vancouver area

302
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:46,399
founded evolved extraction solutions

303
00:11:45,078 --> 00:11:49,838
back in

304
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:52,399
2016 um we're now kind of the the

305
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:55,760
largest extraction equipment and

306
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:59,278
supplies distributor in Canada um more

307
00:11:55,759 --> 00:12:02,039
recently though we launched uh the first

308
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:05,000
thca crystallization commercial system

309
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:08,639
called The genome um been

310
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,320
doing a uh a controlled crystallization

311
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:12,440
course actually at our genome Technology

312
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,680
Center sh out to Murphy Murray who

313
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:18,720
actually instructs that course um super

314
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:22,799
awesome way to learn about uh about how

315
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:26,959
to isolate THC at different kind of

316
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:29,719
scales um so uh yeah that kind of sums

317
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:32,239
it up we'll get into that later for sure

318
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:34,839
maybe uh head over to Murphy Murray as

319
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,639
you just mentioned her welcome

320
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:39,639
Murphy hey thanks for having me

321

appreciate it uh I think it's very

322
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:44,399
fitting to come back to be on hash

323
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:46,799
Church um the day the Tik Tok gets

324
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:50,519
turned off what a what a fun day for us

325
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:53,120
all um taking it back old school but

326
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:53,120
I've been

327
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:59,278
uh exactly exactly um a solventless

328
00:12:57,639 --> 00:13:01,120
folks haven't never been able to post on

329
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:03,958
there our our drugs look exactly like

330
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,959
drugs so we've been affected the whole

331
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:08,518
time but um I've been in this industry

332
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:10,319
so long that I stopped like dropping the

333
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:13,759
years because it was starting to make me

334
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:15,879
sound old I started out uh doing solvent

335
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:20,360
list with Nic you know with Mila's

336
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:22,078
little uh you know washer and um quickly

337
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:24,639
I basically have just been trying to do

338
00:13:22,078 --> 00:13:27,278
whatever is new as soon as it's new the

339
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:29,919
whole time I've been going and

340
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:32,078
fortunately for me it has gotten boring

341
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:35,838
yet so I keep doing it um I've worked on

342
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:37,599
the equipment side the most you know um

343
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:41,160
so I've worked with a lot of different

344
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:43,920
equipment manufacturers and even as a

345
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:45,399
consultant and an educator my focus has

346
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:47,198
always really been on like how do we

347
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:48,839
make this job easier for ourselves even

348
00:13:47,198 --> 00:13:52,559
with solvent

349
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:53,880
list I started with a washer um and I

350
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:57,078
know that people out there love their

351
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:58,720
Wooden Spoons but I also just love um

352
00:13:57,078 --> 00:13:59,879
spending my time consuming these

353
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,079
products

354
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:02,759
and I think that's why so many of us

355
00:14:01,078 --> 00:14:05,000
were available today because you know

356
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:07,399
solvent-based extractions way faster so

357
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
we have more free time we can hang out

358
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:12,278
and uh consume each other so um I've

359
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,159
been doing education building equipment

360
00:14:12,278 --> 00:14:17,600
and um you know my Consulting is more of

361
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:19,600
lab advisory roles um a little bit of

362
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,800
consultant for cool clients for you know

363
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,480
from time to time now but I love

364
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:27,120
learning and that's why I teach because

365
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,399
it opens up the greatest

366
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,240
opportunities awesome well we're happy

367
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:33,559

had the back light lit and quite a few

373
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:46,399
people in chat even put up the rip to

374
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:48,600
Horatio so I felt like we got a little

375
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,759
visit from our good friend Horatio

376

Delbert who of course passed away a few

377
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:56,759
years ago and was an absolute Pioneer in

378
00:14:54,078 --> 00:14:58,559
both solvent and solventless extraction

379
00:14:56,759 --> 00:15:00,919
go ahead Mark if it wasn't if it wasn't

380

a PhD and so my a lot of what I learn is

439

I've been uh using CO2 extraction for

463
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:28,480
what almost 10 years now I've built my

464

00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:42,879
been trying to do obviously Nick was

470
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:44,798
also involved in that at yaka Chief hops

471
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:47,280

Yak with him or not but um no no

473
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:50,759
according to them I came from the Dark

474
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:52,600
Side so I'm actually the company that

475
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:55,400
worked at hos which is the other larger

476
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:58,119
competitor um and so my boss is the

477
00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:00,480
former CEO of yak ma Chief currently

478
00:18:58,119 --> 00:19:04,359
okay me on I'm I'm working with a bunch

479
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:07,159
of folks from Yak ma Chief but yeah but

480
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:09,319
I did meet Nick through the Hop industry

481
00:19:07,159 --> 00:19:11,039
uh and then through this job at vuka

482
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:12,759
just to give the panel a little bit of

483
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:14,319
background if you don't know Nick he's

484
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:16,640
was the sort of one of the main

485
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:18,158
extractors for yakam mief I can't even

486
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,280
remember the numbers it was absolutely

487
00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:22,760
astonishing it's like 4,000 kilos an

488
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:25,079
hour or something that he was processing

489
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:27,279
through this giant machine that they had

490
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:29,000
created but the thing that really piqued

491
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:31,599
my interest was that he had some

492
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,480
colleagues that designed some analytical

493
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:35,519
equipment where they could perceive to

494
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:38,640
the trillionth instead of the billionth

495
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:40,599
like the proton NMR so we want to get

496
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,759
these guys on Marshall you'll be invited

497
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:45,759
to that show anyone who feels they have

498
00:19:42,759 --> 00:19:47,319
a specialty in aromatic compounds uh

499
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:48,919
you'll be invited to that show we're

500
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:50,399
going to get Jeremy Plum on there we're

501
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:52,038
going to get Nick zegler we'll have

502
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,519
Marshall come on and what we're really

503
00:19:52,038 --> 00:19:56,558
waiting for is his two colleagues who

504
00:19:54,519 --> 00:20:00,400
put that equipment together because Nick

505
00:19:56,558 --> 00:20:02,000
is not willing to speak on their work uh

506
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,080
instead of having them speak on their

507
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,240
work so I'll look forward to that show

508
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:11,240
uh kind of in the near future uh and

509
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:13,279
then we'll head on over to jar Yari Yari

510
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:15,519
how you doing Yari good how are you

511
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:18,000
thanks for having me on dude I kind of

512
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:21,119
thought it was cool jar you know jar

513
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,079
hashar Yari you whatever works a a Yari

514
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:24,479
of hash and you as well my friends so

515
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:25,599
please give us a little introduction let

516
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,679
us know where you're at and what you're

517
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:31,798
doing yeah so I've been growing for

518
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:33,759
close to like 17 years now um I got I

519
00:20:31,798 --> 00:20:36,079
got I've been doing it in Colorado since

520
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:38,319
kind of like the first legalization we

521
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:40,439
all had like the med cards and all that

522
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:43,839
and then um once the extraction hit the

523
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:46,000
scene uh I was was just interested in it

524
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:48,038
and um the first system that I heard

525
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,880
about was the ETS machine so I actually

526
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:53,558
went down and met uh Murphy um at the

527
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:56,000
etss place but I couldn't get any clean

528
00:20:53,558 --> 00:20:58,240
runs because of those Carvers it was

529
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,119
leeching oil into every one of my runs

530
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,880
that I did did and Murphy helped me as

531
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:05,319
much as she possibly could and uh it

532
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,280
just we just couldn't make it happen so

533
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:09,319
she was the one who actually suggested

534
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:12,319
that I go over and meet the guys at

535
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:16,639
Incredibles which is where I met Max and

536
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:18,359
Telly and AK and then I met Dr Mark so

537
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,679
um that's kind of like the background of

538
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:23,959
how I got going in in the scene and um I

539
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,320
used their system for years it was great

540
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:27,079
but then I needed to upgrade a little

541
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:29,720
bit so I started kind of piecing

542
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:31,759
together and building my own systems so

543
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:33,720
um that's that's where I'm at with the

544
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:36,200
with my background and

545
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:38,839
extraction beautiful well appreciate you

546
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:41,558
sharing with us uh we've got uh well

547
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:41,558
let's go over to

548
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:46,000
Max there he is welcome

549
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:51,519
Max you guys can you hear me okay yes I

550
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:53,319
made the mistake of speaking right while

551
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:55,480
you spoke and I cut you out but I won't

552
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:57,839
do that again I promise no worries at

553
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,599
all well thanks again it's cool to see

554
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:02,678
some old faces cool to see some new

555
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:06,119
faces what up Dr Mark thanks for putting

556
00:22:02,679 --> 00:22:08,960
this on um so I guess quick little

557
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:11,798
origin story is I've been in legal

558
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:14,038
cannabis since about like 2008 give or

559
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:17,240
take so going on two decades now at this

560
00:22:14,038 --> 00:22:19,000
point kind of crazy um and it started

561
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:20,759
out just wanting good weed you know I

562
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,480
was never much of a hustler I just

563
00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:25,879
wanted to like secure The Chronic for

564
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:27,720
myself um I remember when I was younger

565
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,039
and I bought a bag from my dealer and he

566
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:31,278
had better weed

567
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:33,079
in his sack than what he sold me and

568
00:22:31,278 --> 00:22:37,640
that was the day I realized I was like

569
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:39,678
oh I like need control over my Supply so

570
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:42,400
it started like that and then it started

571
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:44,720
just uh making some hash for fun in my

572
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:47,880
backyard with some trim you know open

573
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,919
blasting at one point uh Derek Cummings

574
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:53,240
and I got Linked UP many people know him

575
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:57,080
in the industry not everyone does but

576
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:59,440
um what's that I just said D Money D

577
00:22:57,079 --> 00:23:01,879
money

578
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:04,000
so um you know we started making ice

579
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,919
hash with just a Home Depot washing

580
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,359
machine that had a metal drum you know

581
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:09,080
we tried to do what we could with what

582
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:11,558
we had at the time at least no plastic

583
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:14,319
in there um and so it just started with

584
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:15,918
big you know big large ice hash runs

585
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:18,278
where we had a pulley system on bolt

586
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:21,840
bags pulling bags so that was a lot of

587
00:23:18,278 --> 00:23:24,480
fun um and then just you know I've got a

588
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:26,278
a scientifically inclined mind and

589
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,558
wanted to play with solvents and wanted

590
00:23:26,278 --> 00:23:30,720
to make the elusive shatter at the time

591
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:32,599
time something that was holdable and not

592
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,440
sticky and you know things come full

593
00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:36,798
circle and we realize that shatter is

594
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:38,240
not it used to be if it doesn't shatter

595
00:23:36,798 --> 00:23:39,839
it doesn't matter hold it from the

596
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:44,640
bottom all these little things that we

597
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:46,879
used to have um but uh so then that

598
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,919
continued to evolve and became you know

599
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:51,840
solv and extraction became a real

600
00:23:48,919 --> 00:23:53,960
industry and uh so we were already kind

601
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:56,558
of playing around in our backyard honing

602
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:59,759
in something uh unbeknownst that there

603
00:23:56,558 --> 00:24:02,278
was going to be high demand for it so at

604
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:04,400
medically correct Incredibles uh dererk

605
00:24:02,278 --> 00:24:07,440
and I Linked UP Telly Ryan Hubble came

606
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:10,080
on board at some point and we Dicky

607
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,960
don't forget Dicky oh oh yeah and Dicky

608
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:13,960
we got we got Dicky who's not in the

609
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:17,360
scene but he's a behind the scenes dude

610
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:19,400
who was a crucial component in machine

611
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:22,558
fabrication we ended up designing our

612
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:24,480
own extraction machine what Ryan did not

613
00:24:22,558 --> 00:24:26,558
uh advertise for ourselves is that we're

614
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:29,240
inventors on record for a patent on that

615
00:24:26,558 --> 00:24:31,879
piece of equipment and we never really

616
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:33,839
came out to to you know do anything

617
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:35,840
related to metal we were just hash

618
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:37,959
makers and we saw the end goal we wanted

619
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:39,918
and we saw that none of the equipment

620
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:41,960
that was available at the time was able

621
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:44,799
to you know deliver what we were looking

622
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:46,720
for we knew some basic things like you

623
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:48,359
know solvent exposure time and

624
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,480
temperature and all these components

625
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:53,158
that we wanted more control over and no

626
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:55,480
one had access and we would give people

627
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:57,278
feedback who were designing machines and

628
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:59,360
I don't know if it was ego if it was too

629
00:24:57,278 --> 00:25:01,798
much work for them to change CH it but

630
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:04,359
we were giv boots on the ground feedback

631
00:25:01,798 --> 00:25:06,879
as users on how they could improve their

632
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:09,439
Tech um and then it just became easier

633
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,799
to design our own so I don't know if it

634
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,320
was in

635
00:25:10,798 --> 00:25:15,558
2017 I don't know when we got our patent

636
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:18,599
Telly do you know actually the year we

637
00:25:15,558 --> 00:25:19,278
got that um you're muted right now by

638
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:24,798
the

639
00:25:19,278 --> 00:25:27,679
way um I think it was awarded in

640
00:25:24,798 --> 00:25:30,639
2019 but all the all the work was done

641
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:33,880
in 2014 14 yeah so that was something we

642
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:36,120
were working on for a while um and then

643
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:38,039
those of us who are in Colorado know

644
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:40,398
that the industry I'm sure everywhere

645
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:42,398
has been kind of tumultuous and so you

646
00:25:40,398 --> 00:25:44,839
know the race to the bottom has happened

647
00:25:42,398 --> 00:25:46,959
and at one point I was overseeing three

648
00:25:44,839 --> 00:25:49,839
cultivation facilities as well as the

649
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:53,360
laboratory that Ryan was managing and we

650
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:56,119
had about I don't know uh maybe 20,000

651
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:58,678
square feet of grow space so it was you

652
00:25:56,119 --> 00:26:01,439
know it was um you know more than a

653
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:02,919
small thing but they get bigger uh in

654
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,440
between then and now we ended up

655
00:26:02,919 --> 00:26:08,080
relinquishing our cultivation licenses

656
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,360
because everything was just saturated

657
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:12,158
and you know there's internal drama we

658
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:14,678
had with the fire department one reason

659
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:16,600
or another we just had some friction so

660
00:26:14,679 --> 00:26:18,960
my role has changed a lot and we're not

661
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:21,639
doing a ton of extraction anymore I'm

662
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:24,038
still at medically correct doing R&amp;D and

663
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:26,960
recipe formulation you know working out

664
00:26:24,038 --> 00:26:29,558
some Nano some nanotech and stuff like

665
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:32,519
that um but for the most part that's

666
00:26:29,558 --> 00:26:35,720
kind of the the elevator pitch of about

667
00:26:32,519 --> 00:26:36,839
20 years ago to now um one thing I was

668
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:39,519
just thinking about while we were

669
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:42,038
sitting here is Murphy I can't remember

670
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:44,720
if it was you or not but when I first

671
00:26:42,038 --> 00:26:46,480
came on had left pink house which was a

672
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:49,519
real fun gig we all were doing a good

673
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:51,519
thing there um but that wasn't being

674
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:53,960
operated very professionally so things

675
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:55,960
kind of disintegrated there when I first

676
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:58,840
came over to medically correct we were

677
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:02,558
using kind of a hybridized

678
00:26:58,839 --> 00:27:05,240
obos maybe partial ETS thing and I

679
00:27:02,558 --> 00:27:08,480
needed to swing by and get a a cares

680
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:09,960
saer replaced and I think it was you and

681
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:13,079
there was a bunch of little aloe vera

682
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:16,399
plants that were at the office and I I

683
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:18,480
had been given one and uh ended up

684
00:27:16,398 --> 00:27:20,439
turning that one aloe vera plant into

685
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,319
like this psychotic Obsession of

686
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:26,759
propagation and turned it into thousands

687
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:28,480
if not multi of plants all under just

688
00:27:26,759 --> 00:27:31,480
some little grow lights in our machine

689
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:33,240
shop Warehouse to the got excessive and

690
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:35,558
I'm like I can't transplant these things

691
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:38,759
anymore we had to start giving them away

692
00:27:35,558 --> 00:27:41,278
uh but that same cutting of aloe vera Is

693
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:44,480
Still rocking probably a decade later

694
00:27:41,278 --> 00:27:46,640
and has made thousands and thousands of

695
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,720
hours that have gone out I love that I'm

696
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:50,480
looking at five propagations of it up on

697
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,839
my window sill and the big one down here

698
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:56,640
in front of me like you need Aloe Vera

699
00:27:52,839 --> 00:28:00,158
in Colorado it's it's dry out here I I

700
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:01,840
attribute that uh Army that I built to

701
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:04,440
you and the first one that I got when I

702
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:05,798
was picking up a a refurbed cares saer

703
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:08,759
yeah well that's perfect let's keep the

704
00:28:05,798 --> 00:28:10,960
aloe going and stop using you know oiled

705
00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:13,720
compressors you know it's just really

706
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:17,480
good position for us all to be in

707
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:19,640
finally absolutely that's me hey thanks

708
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:21,919
Max appreciate the breakdown and that's

709
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:23,600
a I couldn't tell if it was a real fish

710
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:25,000
tank or if it was like some digital

711
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:28,398
screen that you have but that's a real

712
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:31,480
fish tank oh yeah that's a 75 full H

713
00:28:28,398 --> 00:28:34,558
yeah dude yeah I'm telling you anyone

714
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:36,960
that loves weed and like getting stoned

715
00:28:34,558 --> 00:28:39,000
and staring at a fish tank it's got to

716
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:43,798
still be one of my favorite things to do

717
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:45,798
like 25 years later yeah 100% And my God

718
00:28:43,798 --> 00:28:47,200
if you like growing weed there's so many

719
00:28:45,798 --> 00:28:49,759
parallels because you got to make sure

720
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,038
the water levels are right and you know

721
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:53,079
look at everyone make sure they're

722
00:28:51,038 --> 00:28:54,679
healthy they're talking listen listen at

723
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:56,599
one point in time years ago it was got

724
00:28:54,679 --> 00:28:58,679
to be close to 30 years ago I remember I

725
00:28:56,599 --> 00:29:00,678
went over to breeder Steve's place and

726
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:03,320
he had started this what he was calling

727
00:29:00,679 --> 00:29:05,519
guppy ponics and he had these Egyptian

728
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:07,839
mouth breeder fish and he was there was

729
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:09,480
this whole cycle of like the fish pooped

730
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:11,158
and then the worms ate their poop and

731
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:15,640
then they pooped and that poop fed the

732
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:17,559
plants and this herb was so [ __ ] like

733
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:19,759
I I can't even explain it it was like

734
00:29:17,558 --> 00:29:22,240
herb that felt like it was flushed like

735
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:24,599
a thousand X from any herb that I'd ever

736
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,079
seen before it was just just more

737
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:28,678
breeder Steve stuff and then he got a

738
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:31,359
kick out of uh you know feeding the fish

739
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:33,000
his uh like his hamburger to to bug out

740
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:34,158

00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:55,079
horge who's in the room he hasn't turned

750
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:57,798
on his camera yet I don't know if we're

751
00:29:55,079 --> 00:30:00,439

753
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:03,798
going good man it's going good you want

754
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:06,480
to give a little introduction to the to

755
00:30:03,798 --> 00:30:10,158
the crew I'm sure many know you and may

756
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:12,919
not so my name is uh H if you can't roll

757
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:15,320
the r it's all good you can say George

758
00:30:12,919 --> 00:30:18,759
um no better known as wax plug in the

759
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:21,720
industry so I started back in like uh

760
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:24,240
2016 open blasting like straight up just

761
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:27,159
glass tube in the backyard like everyone

762
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:29,359
else I'm sure and uh started doing my

763
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:32,000
research there in the background until I

764
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:34,759
developed uh or found a way to bleach

765
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,960
the oil which became what's known now as

766
00:30:34,759 --> 00:30:41,398
CRC so my introduction into like the

767
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:43,360
main industry was around 2018 when I

768
00:30:41,398 --> 00:30:46,319
introduced or shared some of the

769
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:49,879
techniques I was doing from there I was

770
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:52,798
able to uh gain more opportunities uh

771
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:56,760
eventually opened up chemtech which is a

772
00:30:52,798 --> 00:30:59,119
company which distributes equipment and

773
00:30:56,759 --> 00:31:01,759
like centrifuges stainless steel

774
00:30:59,119 --> 00:31:04,638
components just about everything really

775
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:08,480
consumables but from there I was able to

776
00:31:04,638 --> 00:31:11,278
then really focus on research and trying

777
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:13,120
out stuff so I was able to really

778
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:16,440
connect with a lot of labs and

779
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:18,599
eventually ended up uh forming wax plug

780
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:20,880
Academy which is now an educational

781
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:22,879
platform where we help others learn

782
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,559
through there and also uh through a

783
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:27,278
university in Argentina right now in

784
00:31:24,558 --> 00:31:29,519
Buenos sidtis so we have two platforms

785
00:31:27,278 --> 00:31:31,440
right now going and like I said having

786
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:33,720
all these tools at your disposal has

787
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:37,159
really just helped push everything

788
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:39,079
forward and I travel the world a lot

789
00:31:37,159 --> 00:31:41,480
currently like I have been to a lot of

790
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:42,839
countries and helped uh push the

791
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:45,480
techniques over there forward get the

792
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:47,918
knowledge going and just prevent some of

793
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:51,120
the pitfalls that we saw in the

794
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:52,480
beginning uh what else I mean yeah

795
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:55,119
that's about it I've been mainly just

796
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:58,558
focusing on crystallization

797
00:31:55,119 --> 00:32:00,000
lately and developing equipment I would

798
00:31:58,558 --> 00:32:02,638
say those are like the main focuses

799
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,880
right now I've seen in the industry nice

800
00:32:02,638 --> 00:32:07,199
well I I met Jorge and yes I can roll my

801
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:09,600
ARS

802
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,840
because so I absolutely know how to roll

803
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:13,158
my arm I just didn't I was like I didn't

804
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:14,599
want to sound like I was you know trying

805
00:32:13,159 --> 00:32:17,000
to speak Spanish or whatnot but I'll

806
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:18,439
call you Jorge from now on my friend and

807
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,159
yeah we met in

808
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:24,200
Berlin uh gez it had to be a year or two

809
00:32:21,159 --> 00:32:25,679
ago now through Alex Rogers ICBC the

810
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:28,480
international cannabis business

811
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:31,278
conference and Jorge was just

812
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:33,079
he was just rocking diamonds this guy

813
00:32:31,278 --> 00:32:34,638
was walking around with big old diamonds

814
00:32:33,079 --> 00:32:38,278

887
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,800
friendship with you I don't know how we

888
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:50,358
had a little falling out but uh I'm

889

really glad that you're alive I'm really

890
00:35:50,358 --> 00:35:53,759
glad that you're here for the solvent

891
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:57,039
episode I mean for those of you that

892
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:59,160
don't know Indra really was you know

893
00:35:57,039 --> 00:36:01,599
kind of the grand grandfather of BHO he

894
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:04,559
released that process in back in

895
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:07,400
1999 on ero.org

896
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:09,159
and uh really kind of got the ball

897
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:11,000
rolling you know he was also one of the

898
00:36:09,159 --> 00:36:13,480
first people that

899
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,679
um you know when things were going a

900
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:18,079
little bit the wrong way with the Ethel

901
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:20,679
martines and sort of you know open

902
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:23,039
blasting and and young people blowing up

903
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:25,039
he was immediately completely conscious

904
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:28,559
of it and he reached out to me of all

905
00:36:25,039 --> 00:36:31,079
people which kind of fed into my bias of

906
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:32,440
of of BHO because you know he'd hit me

907
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:34,119
up and he'd be like look you got to warn

908
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,720
people about these mer capatin that are

909
00:36:34,119 --> 00:36:37,519
in the oil they're not good they

910
00:36:35,719 --> 00:36:38,919
concentrate you got to you got to warn

911
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:40,440
people that they can't be doing open

912
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:43,800
blasting and they can't that that that

913
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:46,039
that plugs spark inside the plug you

914
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:49,079
can't be like out on your deck like with

915
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:51,000
your bikini top like blasting BHO and so

916
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:53,200
he was really although he was the guy

917
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:56,079
that released this process he was also

918
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:57,799
very conscious and like I could tell

919
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:59,318
that it was hurting his soul a little

920
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:01,039
bit that something that he had released

921
00:36:59,318 --> 00:37:03,880
that he really just meant for it to be

922
00:37:01,039 --> 00:37:06,480
such a good thing uh had been taken in a

923
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:08,480
way sort of spread in a way that was a

924
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:11,280
little bit disconcerting and so I got to

925
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:13,559
give props to all of you on the panel

926
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:17,200
because really what you guys are are the

927
00:37:13,559 --> 00:37:19,880
people who are pioneering this solvent

928
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:22,039
extraction far away from you know I mean

929
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:24,160
we can laugh about it now hor just said

930
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:26,159
oh I was open blasting like we all were

931
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:28,000
it's like God thank you that you're all

932
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:29,879
here that you're all safe that none of

933
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,679
you are have burn marks on your body for

934
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:33,720
the rest of your lives there's the right

935
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:36,118
way and the wrong way to do things uh

936
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:37,679
and obviously that particular process it

937
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:39,760
really I say it all the time and I don't

938
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:42,759
mean it as a pun but it is a pun it

939
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:45,720
spread like wildfire I mean when he

940
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:48,280
released that method it was within a

941
00:37:45,719 --> 00:37:51,118
month of me releasing bubble bags and I

942
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:55,200
really remember kind of being like

943
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:57,680
really like really dude like cuz B was

944
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:59,559
more popular there just there's no like

945
00:37:57,679 --> 00:38:01,078
can't deny that it was more popular now

946
00:37:59,559 --> 00:38:02,679
I'd love to get into this conversation

947
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:05,560
with you guys because I know a lot of

948
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:08,159
you uh are like Max in the sense of just

949
00:38:05,559 --> 00:38:09,719
trying to get the best heady stash in

950
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:11,679
your in your bag you just want the best

951
00:38:09,719 --> 00:38:15,399
you're a lot of us were just have always

952
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:17,358
been looking for the best so it's nice

953
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:19,079
to see I I don't want to lose my train

954
00:38:17,358 --> 00:38:22,159
of thought but it's it's nice to

955
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:24,599
see people taking things out of this

956
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:27,239
sort of sketchy situation and bringing

957
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:29,119
it into a much more hey maybe having a

958
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:31,199
little bit of chemistry understanding

959
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:32,640
having a class one div one room you know

960
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:34,239
all of these different things that many

961
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:38,199
of you guys have sort of pioneered in

962
00:38:34,239 --> 00:38:40,959
this industry uh have been uh very very

963
00:38:38,199 --> 00:38:43,000
important to to bring to to the

964
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:45,079
Forefront so that these products can

965
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,480
become made available I was terrified

966
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:48,480
back in the day and I know you guys

967
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:50,760

968
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:52,559
been a little like terrified too when it

969
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:54,880

terpinator up on the internet you know

976
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:15,440
first one of the first Clos loops and uh

977
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:18,280
so I made my own version of that because

978
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:21,159
it was all open blasting before that so

979
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:23,440
uh my whole goal was to make because I

980
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:25,920
I'm very um you know engineering

981
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:28,480
inclined I'm not formally educated but I

982
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:31,519
have definitely uh made closed Loops

983
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:33,880
myself and have adapted many and done a

984
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:36,318
lot of custom stuff on that and so my

985
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:38,680
very first one I made uh I started

986
00:39:36,318 --> 00:39:42,318
making in 2010 so I had it going for

987
00:39:38,679 --> 00:39:44,559
about a year and a half um and then I

988
00:39:42,318 --> 00:39:46,679
did like some custom stuff to it and I

989
00:39:44,559 --> 00:39:48,358
was doing like I had like a dip tube in

990
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:52,318
it and I was doing like different

991
00:39:48,358 --> 00:39:54,400
batches into like U Teflon bags and then

992
00:39:52,318 --> 00:39:55,838
I would just have like a a gelled ice

993
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,960
cube thing that I would warm up and put

994
00:39:55,838 --> 00:39:59,719
in the bottom and I would evated out

995
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:01,240
like that and I was still keeping the

996
00:39:59,719 --> 00:40:03,199
liquid in it so I could use dry ice

997
00:40:01,239 --> 00:40:05,039
blocks to separate it later because

998
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:07,199
that's how I was doing holy water and

999
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:09,759
after about a year and a half there was

1000
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:11,799
just a static a static problem that

1001
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:14,200
definitely ignited it and ignited me in

1002
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:15,560
the process uh but this was in the very

1003
00:40:14,199 --> 00:40:18,000
beginning this was before people came

1004
00:40:15,559 --> 00:40:21,719
out with clothes Loop machines um you

1005
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,719
know this was very very beginning and so

1006
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:26,318
um you know that was my lesson on that

1007
00:40:23,719 --> 00:40:28,598
was you do need a C1 D1 uh you know I

1008
00:40:26,318 --> 00:40:30,480
was gone I was given the liquid to

1009
00:40:28,599 --> 00:40:32,200
Addison for a long time at Steep Hill

1010
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,440
because that's how I met a lot of people

1011
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:36,239
in the beginning was doing testing uh

1012
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:38,119
because nobody had any information on

1013
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:40,598
any of this stuff so I was having to do

1014
00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:42,920
my own testing at that time and so I was

1015
00:40:40,599 --> 00:40:44,599
giving stuff to him and nobody had seen

1016
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:46,079
liquid or anything like that and that's

1017
00:40:44,599 --> 00:40:48,280
what I prefer to smoke I just like the

1018
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:50,440
tpin you know that's my main thing it's

1019
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:53,359
really the flavor it's always been that

1020
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:54,800
and and so I've been giving it to him

1021
00:40:53,358 --> 00:40:56,119
and then I just disappeared for nine

1022
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,280
months because I was in the hospital for

1023
00:40:56,119 --> 00:41:01,079
a month uh you know I had three

1024
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:04,519
surgeries skin graph stuff like really

1025
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:06,039
gnarly almost died type of stuff um you

1026
00:41:04,519 --> 00:41:07,920
know and then I Liv parents for about

1027
00:41:06,039 --> 00:41:11,480
eight months uh who they had to take

1028
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:13,000
care of me and then after that uh the

1029
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:16,440
the whole thing like literally like the

1030
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,920
word dab came out in 2013 like uh the

1031
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,880
industry started getting big right

1032
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:22,599
around there and people would be coming

1033
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:23,960
to steep hill and I be like oh that's

1034
00:41:22,599 --> 00:41:26,000
good you know but my friend does this

1035
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:28,079
thing makes this liquid and started

1036
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,760
telling people about me and so by the

1037
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:32,160
time I was healed and feeling better A

1038
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:34,520
lot of people everywhere knew who I was

1039
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:36,279
or at least knew the name you know holy

1040
00:41:34,519 --> 00:41:38,440
water and people were like looking for

1041
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:40,040
me they're like does he exist there were

1042
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:42,358
some articles written about it is just

1043
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:44,199
some really interesting coming from just

1044
00:41:42,358 --> 00:41:45,480
being in bed for eight or nine months

1045
00:41:44,199 --> 00:41:46,838
thinking I'm never going to be in this

1046
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:48,119
industry it's not even really an

1047
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:51,719
industry yet I didn't even think it was

1048
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:54,318
G to be possible but I came back and I

1049
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:56,000
tried to teach uh people and it just

1050
00:41:54,318 --> 00:41:58,000
wasn't up to what I was trying to do so

1051
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,679
I started doing it again myself

1052
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,318
even though my parents was like they're

1053
00:41:59,679 --> 00:42:03,679
going to kill me you know but I believed

1054
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:05,239
that this was the thing that I this is

1055
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:06,759
the thing that I like to do the most so

1056
00:42:05,239 --> 00:42:09,199
I always had other jobs and things like

1057
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:11,119
that until this started just coming out

1058
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:13,598
and started literally you know blowing

1059
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:16,760
up in the right way instead

1060
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:18,838
of [ __ ] and then that's when I went out

1061
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:20,880
to um you know I was with uh that

1062
00:42:18,838 --> 00:42:23,078
company nectar in the beginning and I

1063
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:25,960
went out to that um you know High Times

1064
00:42:23,079 --> 00:42:28,200
thing in 2014 in Colorado and that's

1065
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:30,559
when we officially kind of unveiled the

1066
00:42:28,199 --> 00:42:32,318
whole idea of liquid and the separation

1067
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:34,599
thing and that was the very beginning of

1068
00:42:32,318 --> 00:42:36,679
all that um but yeah I live with those

1069
00:42:34,599 --> 00:42:38,559
scars every day and it is something to

1070
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:40,960
think about and it's something that you

1071
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:43,319
know as I've worked in Labs since and

1072
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:46,000
done consultations and things like that

1073
00:42:43,318 --> 00:42:47,639
safety is a priority and it's one of

1074
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,199
those things that I'm so glad to see

1075
00:42:47,639 --> 00:42:51,558
because you don't ever want it to happen

1076
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:54,078
to anyone else and I train a lot of

1077
00:42:51,559 --> 00:42:56,400
people and it's very important to do

1078
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:59,400
things the correct way and to do things

1079
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,599
safely and I love that that's where this

1080
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:02,358
business went because I never thought I

1081
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:04,760
was going to do this for a living this

1082
00:43:02,358 --> 00:43:06,838
is something that I can't believe I am

1083
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:09,480
lucky enough to have an industry around

1084
00:43:06,838 --> 00:43:13,159
something that was a illegal dangerous

1085
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:14,679
hobby um that I had hurt myself and you

1086
00:43:13,159 --> 00:43:16,799
know actually had gotten in trouble for

1087
00:43:14,679 --> 00:43:18,558
in California in the very beginning you

1088
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:21,720
know so I was like the second person

1089
00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:25,079
that they had busted for B back then so

1090
00:43:21,719 --> 00:43:26,719
for me to do this now you know is crazy

1091
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:29,599
did they slap you with a manufacturing

1092
00:43:26,719 --> 00:43:33,199
charge I did I have one yep yeah back in

1093
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:35,720
that was in 200 end 2008 so that was the

1094
00:43:33,199 --> 00:43:37,719
end of 2008 so they didn't bad when they

1095
00:43:35,719 --> 00:43:39,239
when they give you their its own name e

1096
00:43:37,719 --> 00:43:41,439
when they give it like let's call it

1097
00:43:39,239 --> 00:43:43,199
manufacturing and we make it even worse

1098
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:45,559
like you're anything that you're making

1099
00:43:43,199 --> 00:43:47,318
is manufacturing so all the people back

1100
00:43:45,559 --> 00:43:50,240
then since there there was no

1101
00:43:47,318 --> 00:43:52,079
manufacturing for hash people really um

1102
00:43:50,239 --> 00:43:55,279
you know they thought I was like making

1103
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:58,280
meth and so you know that that charge is

1104
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:59,920
just for anything that is bad and so for

1105
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:01,760
to be able to go through all of that and

1106
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:03,680
go through all the you know house arrest

1107
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:05,640
slash all the [ __ ] I had to go

1108
00:44:03,679 --> 00:44:08,719
through uh and that was you know and

1109
00:44:05,639 --> 00:44:10,719
then to burn myself like after that

1110
00:44:08,719 --> 00:44:12,759
things like oh my God so you know it's

1111
00:44:10,719 --> 00:44:14,118
like to to trip up a few times like that

1112
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:15,559
because it's in the very beginning

1113
00:44:14,119 --> 00:44:17,480
you're doing things and Building Things

1114
00:44:15,559 --> 00:44:19,440
That No one's ever done and you're doing

1115
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:21,719
things that you're just like okay you

1116
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:23,880
know is this going to work and there are

1117
00:44:21,719 --> 00:44:25,719
consequences to being at things in the

1118
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:27,200
beginning like that but it's also a

1119
00:44:25,719 --> 00:44:29,039
learning thing and you can teach people

1120
00:44:27,199 --> 00:44:31,039
who are younger and just be like this is

1121
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:32,880
not what you do that's right the people

1122
00:44:31,039 --> 00:44:35,519
who will stand on the shoulders of

1123
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:37,838
giants you being the next generational

1124
00:44:35,519 --> 00:44:39,280
giant it's it's that's what we mean when

1125
00:44:37,838 --> 00:44:41,279
we say standing on the shoulders of

1126
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:44,240
giants we are learning from their

1127
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:46,920
mistakes as much as we are learning uh

1128
00:44:44,239 --> 00:44:49,558
from their breakthroughs and their uh

1129
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:50,880
epiphanies um yeah that's heavy dude for

1130
00:44:49,559 --> 00:44:53,119
sure that's heavy I want to get into

1131
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:55,480
that a little bit more in a bit but I

1132
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:57,280
think as we're going through history at

1133
00:44:55,480 --> 00:45:00,119
this episode it would be cool to hear

1134
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:03,160
from John just out of his own words kind

1135
00:45:00,119 --> 00:45:05,160
of like how he discovered this process

1136
00:45:03,159 --> 00:45:08,239
and how he released this process on

1137
00:45:05,159 --> 00:45:10,799
eroid once he gets done that I do want

1138
00:45:08,239 --> 00:45:14,399
to talk a little bit of more uh from you

1139
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:16,599
know from Adam and Murphy uh Eric uh

1140
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:19,119
tell just in regards to the education

1141
00:45:16,599 --> 00:45:23,519
that you guys are doing now uh Jor as

1142
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:26,960
well uh in regards to what you guys do

1143
00:45:23,519 --> 00:45:28,920
in order to make sure that we're inspire

1144
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:30,639
iring people to do this the right way

1145
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:32,880
now because sometimes like for instance

1146
00:45:30,639 --> 00:45:35,078
I can I can take complete and total you

1147
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:37,280
know accountability for showing everyone

1148
00:45:35,079 --> 00:45:38,559
how to make water hash the wrong way

1149
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:40,480
when I first came out I would take the

1150
00:45:38,559 --> 00:45:43,200
bubble I'd roll it up all wet everyone's

1151
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:45,599
hash was M molding it it was totally my

1152
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:47,719
fault I was responsible for that for

1153
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:49,800
years and it's like here I am trying to

1154
00:45:47,719 --> 00:45:51,118
Pioneer and be a Pioneer and do some new

1155
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:54,400
things and then you make this key

1156
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:56,519
mistake that you wear uh sort of as this

1157
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:58,400
you know for you Eric as a burn mark for

1158
00:45:56,519 --> 00:46:00,719
me just as this sort of conscious like

1159
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:02,440
oh my God like all I wanted people to do

1160
00:46:00,719 --> 00:46:04,439
was have better hash and I'm probably

1161
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:06,639
responsible for like a metric ton of it

1162
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:08,599
molding like that weighed heavy on my

1163
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:10,358
shoulders maybe not as heavy as a burn

1164
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:13,400
but trust me man it weighed heavy on my

1165
00:46:10,358 --> 00:46:15,440
shoulders knowing that I was the reason

1166
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:17,599
that people's hash was molding so that

1167
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:21,159
took a very long time to kind of break

1168
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:25,160
that down and and be you know 2002 to

1169
00:46:21,159 --> 00:46:27,598
2007 or8 I was absolutely obsessed with

1170
00:46:25,159 --> 00:46:30,358
teaching people about

1171
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:31,960
um the desicant you know for me I found

1172
00:46:30,358 --> 00:46:35,400
pizza boxes it was a food grade

1173
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:38,440
cardboard it was hard if I if I if I

1174
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:40,440
seed the hash very very thin over the

1175
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:42,079
cardboard uh it wouldn't stick to the

1176
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:44,000
fibers it would come off beautifully and

1177
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:45,839
the desicant action of the cardboard

1178
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,880
would absorb the water which was also

1179
00:46:45,838 --> 00:46:49,318
being you know weighed down by gravity

1180
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:50,720
and pulled into the cardboard the

1181
00:46:49,318 --> 00:46:52,358
corrugation of the cardboard would go

1182
00:46:50,719 --> 00:46:54,318
into one level and then it would dry go

1183
00:46:52,358 --> 00:46:56,400
into the next level and so it was a way

1184
00:46:54,318 --> 00:47:00,199
for us here in the Pacific Northwest to

1185
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:02,800
to dry hash Nick around 2008 I want to

1186
00:47:00,199 --> 00:47:04,598
say or nine he started coming out well

1187
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,839
he's in Colorado he's not in the Pacific

1188
00:47:04,599 --> 00:47:07,039
Northwest and he's saying I don't know

1189
00:47:05,838 --> 00:47:08,318
what this Bubble Man guy is talking

1190
00:47:07,039 --> 00:47:10,119
about but you don't need to put it on

1191
00:47:08,318 --> 00:47:11,838
[ __ ] cardboard like that's brutal

1192
00:47:10,119 --> 00:47:13,400
just put it on some parchment much

1193
00:47:11,838 --> 00:47:15,679
cleaner no fibers this that and the

1194
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:16,800
other thing and Nick a and I really

1195
00:47:15,679 --> 00:47:18,039
taught each other something because we

1196
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,760
were kind of banging heads I was like

1197
00:47:18,039 --> 00:47:20,920
what the [ __ ] is this guy talking about

1198
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:22,559
he doesn't know what he's talking about

1199
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:23,960
he's over in Colorado saying the exact

1200
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:26,040
same thing [ __ ] bubble man does not

1201
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:27,880
know what he's talking about we learned

1202
00:47:26,039 --> 00:47:30,719
together that yeah in

1203
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:32,599
Colorado where you need all that aloe

1204
00:47:30,719 --> 00:47:35,480
you don't need the desicant action of

1205
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:37,240
the cardboard it'll dry from the air if

1206
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:40,240
you break it up small enough but if you

1207
00:47:37,239 --> 00:47:42,358
try to do that in the Pacific Northwest

1208
00:47:40,239 --> 00:47:43,919
it's not working you are getting

1209
00:47:42,358 --> 00:47:45,358
moisture trapped in your hash and it's

1210
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:47,519
going to cause you problems down the

1211
00:47:45,358 --> 00:47:50,679
line so Indra if you wouldn't mind

1212
00:47:47,519 --> 00:47:54,039
giving us a historical context of how

1213
00:47:50,679 --> 00:47:55,558
you came to this like what the [ __ ] dude

1214
00:47:54,039 --> 00:47:58,759
you're just like sitting around one day

1215
00:47:55,559 --> 00:48:03,200
you're just like what what the [ __ ]

1216
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:08,079
please no I was uh in Vietnam in

1217
00:48:03,199 --> 00:48:12,199
1967 and uh trying to get the locals to

1218
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:13,800
bring us some pot to smoke was nearly

1219
00:48:12,199 --> 00:48:16,358
impossible they would bring it but it

1220
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:18,920
would be these big wet heavy

1221
00:48:16,358 --> 00:48:21,400
Buds and you couldn't light them with a

1222
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:23,720
[ __ ] blowtorch it just wasn't

1223
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:25,280
happening but you could tell that it was

1224
00:48:23,719 --> 00:48:29,639
good cuz it looked

1225
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:31,880
good so I uh I started thinking about

1226
00:48:29,639 --> 00:48:36,078
it and I

1227
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:39,119
thought well maybe I should try a small

1228
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:40,599
I had read about gasas extraction back

1229
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:43,358
in

1230
00:48:40,599 --> 00:48:46,160
1898 and uh I thought well maybe this

1231
00:48:43,358 --> 00:48:49,400
will work so I took a big pen I shoved

1232
00:48:46,159 --> 00:48:53,279
the barrel out of it crammed it with wet

1233
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:57,318
Buds turned it upside down took a Ronson

1234
00:48:53,280 --> 00:49:00,000
butane lighter refill thing and hammered

1235
00:48:57,318 --> 00:49:03,119
it and there on the dish in front of me

1236
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,760
and a few other guys sitting was a red

1237
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:07,480
puddle

1238
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:09,599
bubbling and everybody's like what's

1239
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:12,280
that Dave and I'm

1240
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:14,720
like that might be the reason or the

1241
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:17,760
answer to us getting high

1242
00:49:14,719 --> 00:49:19,159
so not a good thing to do but everybody

1243
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:21,400
put it on

1244
00:49:19,159 --> 00:49:25,558
cigarettes and everybody smoked it

1245
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:28,680
including myself and everybody got

1246
00:49:25,559 --> 00:49:31,599
hammered and and they're

1247
00:49:28,679 --> 00:49:34,078
wondering what it was and I said well

1248
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:36,880
it's it's oil from the

1249
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:43,160
plant that was in '

1250
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:43,160
67 then I uh came back to the States

1251
00:49:43,838 --> 00:49:50,358
68 and uh I was shot all the pieces I

1252
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:54,358
got shot through the

1253
00:49:50,358 --> 00:49:57,759
middle while I was there and

1254
00:49:54,358 --> 00:50:01,960
uh I came back and I was thinking about

1255
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:04,040
it for the longest time and then uh

1256
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:10,000
around

1257
00:50:04,039 --> 00:50:11,719
1988 or 89 I ran into this guy I went to

1258
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,199
Switzerland and while I was in

1259
00:50:11,719 --> 00:50:18,639
Switzerland I

1260
00:50:13,199 --> 00:50:22,399
met a guy named Hans who offered me

1261
00:50:18,639 --> 00:50:26,199
space to work in his shop even though it

1262
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:29,639
was totally illegal he saw something

1263
00:50:26,199 --> 00:50:31,960
else in he saw flowers and spices and

1264
00:50:29,639 --> 00:50:34,679
stuff like that so he wanted me to be

1265
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:36,079
there and we did start that we worked

1266
00:50:34,679 --> 00:50:38,519
for

1267
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:40,359
roberte one of the biggest perfume

1268
00:50:38,519 --> 00:50:42,679
companies on the

1269
00:50:40,358 --> 00:50:47,598
planet and we worked for them for a

1270
00:50:42,679 --> 00:50:49,118
number of years producing fine perfume

1271
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:52,920
oils

1272
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:57,358
spices and other things like that and

1273
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:59,720
then I started to talk to Hans about

1274
00:50:57,358 --> 00:51:05,519
hey maybe we should uh

1275
00:50:59,719 --> 00:51:11,558
try some large extractions I had a a 38t

1276
00:51:05,519 --> 00:51:15,239
tall 4 in or 4ot wide pipe and we loaded

1277
00:51:11,559 --> 00:51:19,000
that we he introduced me to some Swiss

1278
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:23,598
guys who had been growing pot for a long

1279
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:26,679
time and they had a huge Warehouse that

1280
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:30,318
was I don't know it was 600 ft long 200

1281
00:51:26,679 --> 00:51:33,838
ft wide it was filled with boxes of

1282
00:51:30,318 --> 00:51:34,920
dried pot that mice had come in and

1283
00:51:33,838 --> 00:51:37,719
pissed

1284
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:39,639
on and so these guys were like can you

1285
00:51:37,719 --> 00:51:43,118
do anything about

1286
00:51:39,639 --> 00:51:45,159
that and I was like well yeah I can take

1287
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:46,680
the oil out and it won't smell like M

1288
00:51:45,159 --> 00:51:49,679
mouse piss

1289
00:51:46,679 --> 00:51:51,679
anymore so we moved everything over

1290
00:51:49,679 --> 00:51:55,519
there and started to

1291
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:57,798
work and we were filling this thing up

1292
00:51:55,519 --> 00:52:00,000
every other day

1293
00:51:57,798 --> 00:52:03,318
and we had gallons and gallons and

1294
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:06,960
gallons of this beautiful red oil that

1295
00:52:03,318 --> 00:52:08,000
was just immaculate it tasted so good

1296
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:11,000
you could

1297
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,679
hardly not want to have it every day as

1298
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:18,159
much as

1299
00:52:12,679 --> 00:52:18,159
possible and uh at that point in

1300
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:24,880
time these guys

1301
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:27,318
uh I I wanted to go back to the States

1302
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:29,160
and so I wanted them to pay me

1303
00:52:27,318 --> 00:52:31,079
and they did pay me something but they

1304
00:52:29,159 --> 00:52:34,519
didn't pay me for all the work we did

1305
00:52:31,079 --> 00:52:38,880
well while that was all going

1306
00:52:34,519 --> 00:52:42,880
on they I noticed that after we

1307
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:45,160
extracted there was a lot of uh Tri

1308
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:48,079
chromes

1309
00:52:45,159 --> 00:52:50,798
available and so we wanted to try to

1310
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:54,240
find out how to get the TR chromes the

1311
00:52:50,798 --> 00:52:58,920
most efficient way out of the

1312
00:52:54,239 --> 00:53:04,959
bud and so what I discovered was that if

1313
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:07,400
you freeze the pot using liquid nitrogen

1314
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:10,519
down to extreme low

1315
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:14,000
levels you crunch it all up in a 55

1316
00:53:10,519 --> 00:53:16,599
gallon drum use a 4x4 to smash it while

1317
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:18,880
it's cold and it turns it into a pattern

1318
00:53:16,599 --> 00:53:23,480
basically that leaves you about 2 Ines

1319
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:24,559
or three Ines of crushed material at the

1320
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:29,240
bottom of the

1321
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:32,240
barrel so then I pulled the material out

1322
00:53:29,239 --> 00:53:36,078
and we constructed a silk screen with 26

1323
00:53:32,239 --> 00:53:40,318
in 26 per inch

1324
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:42,640
threads and we took the uh pot that we

1325
00:53:40,318 --> 00:53:45,480
had crunched up in this and put it in

1326
00:53:42,639 --> 00:53:48,199
that and shook it then only the TR

1327
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:51,079
chromes came out all the greens stayed

1328
00:53:48,199 --> 00:53:52,039
behind and the reason it did is because

1329
00:53:51,079 --> 00:53:57,359
the

1330
00:53:52,039 --> 00:53:59,159
green took up some uh moisture

1331
00:53:57,358 --> 00:54:01,480
and it wouldn't fit through the silk

1332
00:53:59,159 --> 00:54:03,960
screen but the tri chromes all fit

1333
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:07,240
through it like there was no tomorrow so

1334
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:09,838
we made these giant piles of golden Tri

1335
00:54:07,239 --> 00:54:13,679
chromes I still have a video of Johnny

1336
00:54:09,838 --> 00:54:17,400
shaking it out and scraping it up on a

1337
00:54:13,679 --> 00:54:19,558
black sheet that we used at the time and

1338
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:20,760
so here we had these Tri chromes and we

1339
00:54:19,559 --> 00:54:26,798
had the

1340
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:29,799
oil so then I thought what will happen

1341
00:54:26,798 --> 00:54:33,119
if we mix the oil and the Dr chromes

1342
00:54:29,798 --> 00:54:39,639
together to make extremely good

1343
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:43,000
hash and I thought about it and uh what

1344
00:54:39,639 --> 00:54:45,879
I did was I poured liquid nitrogen into

1345
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:50,960
a stainless steel bowl those big mixing

1346
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:53,039
bowls you know and uh then I poured the

1347
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:55,480
oil in and then the oil started

1348
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:57,079
shattering immediately because of the

1349
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:58,798
temperature different

1350
00:54:57,079 --> 00:55:01,440
differentiation it shattered and

1351
00:54:58,798 --> 00:55:03,519
shattered and then I stuck a baseball

1352
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:07,000
bat in it made sure it was all finally

1353
00:55:03,519 --> 00:55:09,759
powdered you could it looked like

1354
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:11,679
uh I don't know it it it looked like

1355
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:14,799
maybe milk or something it was milky

1356
00:55:11,679 --> 00:55:18,639
looking so after I got that in then I

1357
00:55:14,798 --> 00:55:22,400
poured in the TR chromes in a ratio of

1358
00:55:18,639 --> 00:55:26,318
55 or 60 to

1359
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:28,519
40 and after that was poured in I start

1360
00:55:26,318 --> 00:55:30,759
St it quite a bit and then just stuck

1361
00:55:28,519 --> 00:55:33,239
the bowl outside on the porch and liquid

1362
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:35,039
nitrogen drained off and that was that

1363
00:55:33,239 --> 00:55:38,078
and you could just reach in and grab a

1364
00:55:35,039 --> 00:55:41,039
handful of this really soft hash that

1365
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:43,720
was you could roll into a temple ball in

1366
00:55:41,039 --> 00:55:46,319
just a few seconds it would dry with

1367
00:55:43,719 --> 00:55:48,038
skin on the outside of it and every

1368
00:55:46,318 --> 00:55:51,519
where we were in California we couldn't

1369
00:55:48,039 --> 00:55:55,079
make it fast enough it was just uh

1370
00:55:51,519 --> 00:55:57,759
everybody wanted it no matter what we

1371
00:55:55,079 --> 00:55:59,599
that that was in the day when there was

1372
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:03,240
dispensaries but they weren't really

1373
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:06,798
legal but we would go to them and take

1374
00:56:03,239 --> 00:56:09,679
one suitcase full of oil in little one G

1375
00:56:06,798 --> 00:56:13,440
bottles we called it golden oil because

1376
00:56:09,679 --> 00:56:15,879
it was golden looking it didn't look red

1377
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:19,760
until you heated it then it turned back

1378
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:21,519
red and we took in a uh little suitcase

1379
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:24,440
full of Temple

1380
00:56:21,519 --> 00:56:27,559
balls we never left any behind at any

1381
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:30,000
head shop they all bought them all if we

1382
00:56:27,559 --> 00:56:32,680
took in two kilos of oil and two kilos

1383
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:34,599
of hash balls they were sold that was it

1384
00:56:32,679 --> 00:56:35,798
they paid us cash money and we were out

1385
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:39,880
the

1386
00:56:35,798 --> 00:56:43,400
door and so that was my way of making

1387
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:46,400
good hash I tried to make it as safe as

1388
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:48,880
possible liquid nitrogen

1389
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:51,519
non-toxic you know the whole nine yards

1390
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:54,079
and so and then so that just LED you

1391
00:56:51,519 --> 00:56:55,679
about 10 years later I would suggest

1392
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:59,000
first of all for those of you that don't

1393
00:56:55,679 --> 00:57:00,719
know who Rob roberte is like this is

1394
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:03,318
this is not just a perfume company this

1395
00:57:00,719 --> 00:57:06,959
is a company that's been around since

1396
00:57:03,318 --> 00:57:09,000
1850 they are like the world's leaders

1397
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:11,559
in natural raw materials when it comes

1398
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:14,679
to fragrance and flavors and extraction

1399
00:57:11,559 --> 00:57:17,200
and like any scientist that works at

1400
00:57:14,679 --> 00:57:19,358
roberte anyone on this panel would die

1401
00:57:17,199 --> 00:57:22,078
to speak to this person for for any

1402
00:57:19,358 --> 00:57:24,480
amount of time they really are serious

1403
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:28,160
serious players so you know that's a big

1404
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:30,119
part of of of of history I would also

1405
00:57:28,159 --> 00:57:32,239
add that you know when you hear kind of

1406
00:57:30,119 --> 00:57:33,720
the older guys talk oh it was the best

1407
00:57:32,239 --> 00:57:38,279
this and that back in the day you have

1408
00:57:33,719 --> 00:57:40,798
to imagine like imagine BHO like 20 or

1409
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:42,839
30 years before anyone had BHO imagine

1410
00:57:40,798 --> 00:57:45,199
what an anomaly it would be to have

1411
00:57:42,838 --> 00:57:50,078
someone put that in your bowl I can tell

1412
00:57:45,199 --> 00:57:51,960
you before I met John I met a guy in

1413
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:53,798
Amsterdam and I wish I could remember

1414
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:55,838
this guy's name he was a little guy

1415
00:57:53,798 --> 00:57:58,599
glasses he was an older guy and he was

1416
00:57:55,838 --> 00:58:01,960
from Seattle and he was a real

1417
00:57:58,599 --> 00:58:03,760
character and I met him in a coffee shop

1418
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:06,960
in Amsterdam and he said he had this

1419
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:08,359
crazy hash oil that you know no one has

1420
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:09,599
and it's stronger than anything in a

1421
00:58:08,358 --> 00:58:11,199
coffee shop and this would have been

1422
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:13,599
like 97 or

1423
00:58:11,199 --> 00:58:16,038
98 and I was kind of like well whatever

1424
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:17,838
you know I smoke pretty good man like I

1425
00:58:16,039 --> 00:58:19,640
you know okay I'll try your hash and he

1426
00:58:17,838 --> 00:58:21,798
he gave me a rip of this hash and I keep

1427
00:58:19,639 --> 00:58:25,038
in mind this is really before anyone had

1428
00:58:21,798 --> 00:58:28,079
tried BHO and I actually took a small

1429
00:58:25,039 --> 00:58:30,599
rip of it and got very very very high

1430
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:32,920
off of it for sure like it was something

1431
00:58:30,599 --> 00:58:35,359
different it wasn't just your average

1432
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:38,639
product um I got so high off of it I

1433
00:58:35,358 --> 00:58:41,318
actually bought a gram from the guy and

1434
00:58:38,639 --> 00:58:43,920
and funny enough and this is it's so

1435
00:58:41,318 --> 00:58:45,798
hard for me to even say this I couldn't

1436
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:47,960
[ __ ] finish it I actually went to

1437
00:58:45,798 --> 00:58:50,318
Mila's pollinator shop on my way out of

1438
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:51,960
the country and I gave it to her and I

1439
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:55,798
swear to God it was still like a half a

1440
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:59,000
gram so anyway I find out that the guy

1441
00:58:55,798 --> 00:59:01,920
got the hash from my buddy the nose and

1442
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:03,960
the nose knows and the nose is Steve

1443

dumac from Amsterdam anyone that's ever

1444

of time at the Cannabis Cup or you know

00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:33,720
and he stuck all this weed in a pen and

1454
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:35,520
he blasted it with a little Ronson tube

1455
00:59:33,719 --> 00:59:37,798
and I was just like that's how you made

1456
00:59:35,519 --> 00:59:40,559
that [ __ ] I was like what the actual

1457
00:59:37,798 --> 00:59:42,559
[ __ ] so I actually got my gram off Steve

1458
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:45,400
it was the last gram that he had I I

1459
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:47,599
don't know how much you made uh there uh

1460
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:49,400
John I I think he said he had like 10 or

1461
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:51,039
20 grams of it it was just a couple of

1462
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:53,160
you know like maybe 10 pen FS or

1463
00:59:51,039 --> 00:59:55,480
something but um it was one of the

1464
00:59:53,159 --> 00:59:57,879
strongest products I I had ever ever

1465
00:59:55,480 --> 01:00:00,400
smoked in my my life and that was the

1466
00:59:57,880 --> 01:00:02,519
small world right you know a year or two

1467
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:06,880
later I would start doing Bubble Bags

1468
01:00:02,519 --> 01:00:09,038
Indra would release um the BHO method uh

1469
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:12,200
and eventually we would you know kind of

1470
01:00:09,039 --> 01:00:14,119
link up to to together I my team

1471
01:00:12,199 --> 01:00:19,118
actually went out to his facility in

1472
01:00:14,119 --> 01:00:22,039
Kansas and saw his like thre story BHO

1473
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:25,119
extractor like the biggest BHO extractor

1474
01:00:22,039 --> 01:00:28,039
you could possibly ever imagine and and

1475
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:32,160
and ran some back is not of cannabis uh

1476
01:00:28,039 --> 01:00:33,480
for uh canabo and aromatic compounds but

1477
01:00:32,159 --> 01:00:35,558
actually for something completely

1478
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:37,358
different but we did end up seeing that

1479
01:00:35,559 --> 01:00:39,599
equipment Mike West and a few other

1480
01:00:37,358 --> 01:00:43,358
people from my team went over there and

1481
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:45,318
worked with Johnny and indr son and and

1482
01:00:43,358 --> 01:00:47,880
we saw that it was real we saw that this

1483
01:00:45,318 --> 01:00:50,920
thing actually existed I we'd never seen

1484
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:53,760
a BHO machine that was metering the BHO

1485
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:55,358
in it would meter it in and out of the

1486
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:57,640
system so he was like we don't have to

1487
01:00:55,358 --> 01:01:00,078
worry about wondering how much is and

1488
01:00:57,639 --> 01:01:01,798
then he would also talk about how like I

1489
01:01:00,079 --> 01:01:03,680
would be like how much did you lose over

1490
01:01:01,798 --> 01:01:05,719
like the course of like some years and

1491
01:01:03,679 --> 01:01:08,598
he's like oh maybe like a cup full so

1492
01:01:05,719 --> 01:01:11,399
he's like reusing anyway cool story

1493
01:01:08,599 --> 01:01:13,119
Indra I appreciate uh the old school

1494
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:17,559
this

1495
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:20,200
1967 in Vietnam how [ __ ] crazy is it

1496
01:01:17,559 --> 01:01:24,200
that skunkman Sam discovered static Tech

1497
01:01:20,199 --> 01:01:26,558
in Africa and Indra discovered the BHO

1498
01:01:24,199 --> 01:01:30,078
method in Vietnam I'm just putting that

1499
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:33,640
together right now whoa what country was

1500
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:38,400
did you discover that in again um

1501
01:01:33,639 --> 01:01:41,400
Sam it was Gambia Gambia of course it

1502
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:43,838
was of course it was West Africa joh I

1503
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:46,160
have a question for you the material

1504
01:01:43,838 --> 01:01:49,798
that you were using that you had boxes

1505
01:01:46,159 --> 01:01:54,118
and boxes with mouse p on it in uh

1506
01:01:49,798 --> 01:01:58,318
Switzerland was it twiss Rod doe or was

1507
01:01:54,119 --> 01:02:02,318
it I because all the stuff that I saw

1508
01:01:58,318 --> 01:02:05,079
mass produced in Switzerland BR the

1509
01:02:02,318 --> 01:02:07,318
dope I don't know because the Swiss guys

1510
01:02:05,079 --> 01:02:10,760
took care of that I took care of the

1511
01:02:07,318 --> 01:02:14,038
production and I didn't speak Swiss

1512
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:17,559
German or Swiss French or swiss anything

1513
01:02:14,039 --> 01:02:20,760
so I was just a listener at those things

1514
01:02:17,559 --> 01:02:23,559
I I saw a lot of people producing a lot

1515
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:27,079
of cannabis in Switzerland when I was

1516
01:02:23,559 --> 01:02:32,559
visiting there but most of them were

1517
01:02:27,079 --> 01:02:37,720
using varieties that were half uh THC

1518
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:42,760
High varieties mixed with Swiss rope doe

1519
01:02:37,719 --> 01:02:45,798
and uh yeah just it's it's not the best

1520
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:49,240
but it it still got the THC in there but

1521
01:02:45,798 --> 01:02:52,559
it probably had a lot of CBD I suspect

1522
01:02:49,239 --> 01:02:54,318
actually right the plant that we used

1523
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:56,680
for all this was a plant that these

1524
01:02:54,318 --> 01:02:59,719
Swiss guys had gotten from the Swiss

1525
01:02:56,679 --> 01:03:02,199
Institute of Technology of plants and it

1526
01:02:59,719 --> 01:03:06,480
was called queen of

1527
01:03:02,199 --> 01:03:11,679
happiness and you could take an 8 in Bud

1528
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:14,639
and shake off about 3 to five grams of

1529
01:03:11,679 --> 01:03:17,798
trrs it was something that the Swiss

1530
01:03:14,639 --> 01:03:19,440
Institute invented and then these guys

1531
01:03:17,798 --> 01:03:22,838
were going there so they took full

1532
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:25,480
advantage of it so that was the that was

1533
01:03:22,838 --> 01:03:27,719
the plant dour was what year what year

1534
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:31,159
was the John in Switzerland like was was

1535
01:03:27,719 --> 01:03:34,000
this in the late 80s or the late 90s it

1536
01:03:31,159 --> 01:03:37,358
was in the late 80s when I went there

1537
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:40,798
and I started producing

1538
01:03:37,358 --> 01:03:43,078
stuff and I could I stayed there as long

1539
01:03:40,798 --> 01:03:45,679
as I could but even finally the Swiss

1540
01:03:43,079 --> 01:03:47,278
people said hey no more visas for you

1541
01:03:45,679 --> 01:03:50,519
get the [ __ ]

1542
01:03:47,278 --> 01:03:53,519
out yeah yeah no I I did it about 10

1543
01:03:50,519 --> 01:03:56,358
years later saw much of what Sam saw as

1544
01:03:53,519 --> 01:03:58,278
well definitely saw fields of decent

1545
01:03:56,358 --> 01:04:01,119
weed as well Steve was growing really

1546
01:03:58,278 --> 01:04:03,119
good weed Shanti Baba was growing really

1547
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:05,838
good weed down in bellan Zona green

1548
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:09,079
houses of of of

1549

01:04:09,079 --> 01:04:13,839
proper you know proper grown actually

1551
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:15,798
some of the nicest flowers I'd ever seen

1552
01:04:13,838 --> 01:04:17,679
grown in Switzerland it was a a

1553
01:04:15,798 --> 01:04:21,798
greenhouse that that Shanti Baba Scott

1554
01:04:17,679 --> 01:04:24,038
Blakey had and it was uh it was 7 foot

1555
01:04:21,798 --> 01:04:26,838
tall Calo plants and it was like walking

1556
01:04:24,039 --> 01:04:30,440
into an orange orch California Orange

1557
01:04:26,838 --> 01:04:32,798
from from originally from me it was so

1558
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:35,278
good Sam holy [ __ ] it was it was

1559
01:04:32,798 --> 01:04:37,038
mindbending walking into this room and I

1560
01:04:35,278 --> 01:04:38,838
remember asking him I was like whoa dude

1561
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:40,520
like how did you do this like everyone

1562
01:04:38,838 --> 01:04:42,798
else was kind of having these problems

1563
01:04:40,519 --> 01:04:45,159
and there was and this is not anything

1564
01:04:42,798 --> 01:04:47,639
against sort of the people in our

1565
01:04:45,159 --> 01:04:48,798
industry or growers in generally and it

1566
01:04:47,639 --> 01:04:51,719
might be something to do with

1567
01:04:48,798 --> 01:04:54,559
prohibition but um I asked him his

1568
01:04:51,719 --> 01:04:56,598
secret and he said I don't hire smokers

1569
01:04:54,559 --> 01:04:59,039
and I was like what he's like well

1570
01:04:56,599 --> 01:05:01,880
really I don't hire Growers and I'm like

1571
01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:04,960
what he's like all my growers in that

1572
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:06,960
Greenhouse are rose Growers I don't hire

1573
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:09,559
weed growers because they already know

1574
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:11,039
how to do everything better than me and

1575
01:05:09,559 --> 01:05:13,640
I don't want them doing that on my

1576
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:15,559
dollar so I just hire Rose Growers I

1577
01:05:13,639 --> 01:05:17,400
tell them instead of Pricks you have to

1578
01:05:15,559 --> 01:05:20,119
be worried about resin that you can get

1579
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:21,559
in your eyes and then it burns and other

1580
01:05:20,119 --> 01:05:23,838
than that they just listened to

1581
01:05:21,559 --> 01:05:26,798
everything he said and executed exactly

1582
01:05:23,838 --> 01:05:28,440
what he said and it was like a perfect

1583
01:05:26,798 --> 01:05:32,038
cannabis grow operation and this was

1584
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:33,798
like back in 2001 that I saw this if I

1585
01:05:32,039 --> 01:05:35,520
was better organized than I had my old

1586
01:05:33,798 --> 01:05:39,519
hard drives plugged in I'd bring up the

1587
01:05:35,519 --> 01:05:43,719
pictures uh of I I hate to say this

1588
01:05:39,519 --> 01:05:47,880
Marcus but this the same thing with me I

1589
01:05:43,719 --> 01:05:51,118
would uh prefer to have Growers that did

1590
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:54,160
not know how to grow pot already and

1591
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:56,358
just did what I told them and uh it

1592
01:05:54,159 --> 01:05:58,440
would come out better than

1593
01:05:56,358 --> 01:06:01,038
all my friends who have been growing for

1594
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:03,838
20 years sounds like you guys just

1595
01:06:01,039 --> 01:06:05,440
prefer using an sop somebody just like

1596
01:06:03,838 --> 01:06:08,358
standard operating

1597
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:11,798
procedures it's almost like you wanted

1598
01:06:08,358 --> 01:06:15,838
employees in some kind of uh you know

1599
01:06:11,798 --> 01:06:18,038
work for pay scenario it's really you

1600
01:06:15,838 --> 01:06:21,078
know it's like so much has changed but

1601
01:06:18,039 --> 01:06:25,119
uh things stay the same but I I want to

1602
01:06:21,079 --> 01:06:27,559
say back to the mouse piss box because I

1603
01:06:25,119 --> 01:06:30,039
I felt that in my heart I think one

1604
01:06:27,559 --> 01:06:33,440
thing about working with solvents in the

1605
01:06:30,039 --> 01:06:36,799
Cannabis industry that is

1606
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:40,159
unfair is that the better you get at

1607
01:06:36,798 --> 01:06:43,559
this craft the worse weed people want to

1608
01:06:40,159 --> 01:06:46,639
bring you to ask you to save them from

1609
01:06:43,559 --> 01:06:50,079
it's like you know we get a lot of

1610
01:06:46,639 --> 01:06:52,759
innovation out of cultivation

1611
01:06:50,079 --> 01:06:55,960
failures someone else has ruined product

1612
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:58,278
for six months and now after it's been

1613
01:06:55,960 --> 01:07:00,000
in storage for another six months I I've

1614
01:06:58,278 --> 01:07:02,920
got to figure out how to make it work

1615
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:05,318
and so what's tricky about that is that

1616
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:08,798
we don't really get to

1617
01:07:05,318 --> 01:07:12,400
brag about some of the coolest parts of

1618
01:07:08,798 --> 01:07:14,679
what we do because it's gross right like

1619
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:17,278
like hor has brought brought up his CRC

1620
01:07:14,679 --> 01:07:18,879
right like it it was so cool to be able

1621
01:07:17,278 --> 01:07:21,358
to pull that pigment

1622
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:23,680
out even when we didn't know you know

1623
01:07:21,358 --> 01:07:25,358
what the function of having it there was

1624
01:07:23,679 --> 01:07:26,838
it was just cool and interesting to be

1625
01:07:25,358 --> 01:07:28,679
able ble to do and talk about but then

1626
01:07:26,838 --> 01:07:31,078
we get this like negative

1627
01:07:28,679 --> 01:07:32,798
connotation and no we now we don't get

1628
01:07:31,079 --> 01:07:34,519
to discuss our science with the same

1629
01:07:32,798 --> 01:07:38,639
excitement because a lot of times we

1630
01:07:34,519 --> 01:07:40,719
learn from some garbage boxes of mouse

1631
01:07:38,639 --> 01:07:43,400
piss weed and we find out we could do

1632
01:07:40,719 --> 01:07:45,278
some really cool [ __ ] no I'm glad you

1633
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:48,160
brought that up Murphy it's a really

1634
01:07:45,278 --> 01:07:49,559
good conversation in the sense of you

1635
01:07:48,159 --> 01:07:51,480
know I had had the conversation with

1636
01:07:49,559 --> 01:07:53,680
media Bros I had had the conversation

1637
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:55,519
with a few different people I've had the

1638
01:07:53,679 --> 01:07:58,078
conversation with the irradiation fol

1639
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:59,838
FKS the the people that do you know when

1640
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:01,839
you're failing microbials and it's you

1641
01:07:59,838 --> 01:08:05,119
know as a as a business

1642
01:08:01,838 --> 01:08:07,119
owner there's there's sort of two views

1643
01:08:05,119 --> 01:08:12,119
of sites and we'll get to you right

1644
01:08:07,119 --> 01:08:12,119
after this Mark um it's

1645
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:17,838
that okay you've got your sort of

1646
01:08:15,239 --> 01:08:20,520
Instagram I hate to call them [ __ ] boys

1647
01:08:17,838 --> 01:08:22,679
but this sort of Instagram Bro Science

1648
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:24,480
of like oh yeah like you can't be doing

1649
01:08:22,679 --> 01:08:26,319
that you can't be doing this and that's

1650
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:29,838
[ __ ] and that's they're just doing

1651
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:30,920
this to to you know polish a turd and

1652
01:08:29,838 --> 01:08:33,278
this that and the other thing from a

1653
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:35,399
business perspective like running a big

1654
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:37,560
facility investing a ton of money like

1655
01:08:35,399 --> 01:08:40,198
having employees having responsibilities

1656
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:42,679
and and being accountable to a to a

1657
01:08:40,198 --> 01:08:44,479
large group of people you know you make

1658
01:08:42,679 --> 01:08:46,440
25 and I asked this question to many

1659
01:08:44,479 --> 01:08:48,439
people in regards to the irradiation

1660
01:08:46,439 --> 01:08:50,639
like I'm not looking to irradiate myself

1661
01:08:48,439 --> 01:08:53,439
I'd love to not have to radiate a single

1662
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:55,560
product if I make 25 kilos of bubble

1663
01:08:53,439 --> 01:08:57,879
hash for a a customer and this happened

1664
01:08:55,560 --> 01:09:00,400
recently and it was wild because they

1665
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:02,679
wanted to use their own lab for testing

1666
01:09:00,399 --> 01:09:03,599
and the the lab came back that it that

1667
01:09:02,679 --> 01:09:05,719
it had

1668
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:07,239
failed um so it needed to go to IR

1669
01:09:05,719 --> 01:09:10,798
radiation which is what they wanted it

1670
01:09:07,238 --> 01:09:12,278
to do I did a huge lab investigation

1671
01:09:10,798 --> 01:09:14,399
because I I just was like that's

1672
01:09:12,279 --> 01:09:16,679
impossible I swab everything I've done

1673
01:09:14,399 --> 01:09:18,559
the math I've done the numbers I am I am

1674
01:09:16,679 --> 01:09:21,319
paying attention to my variables in my

1675
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:24,080
lab and it took me three months and

1676
01:09:21,319 --> 01:09:25,880
after three months I realized down sorry

1677
01:09:24,079 --> 01:09:27,880
John I'll just mute you real quick

1678
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:29,600
um I realized that they had made a

1679
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:30,798
mistake in the lab and that it had not

1680
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:33,560
failed

1681
01:09:30,798 --> 01:09:36,278
now that was three and a half months of

1682
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:38,199
a problematic experience now would you

1683
01:09:36,279 --> 01:09:39,480
tell if you're a brand new company

1684
01:09:38,198 --> 01:09:40,919
you've invested all your money you've

1685
01:09:39,479 --> 01:09:42,718
mortgaged your house you've got your

1686
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:44,679
buddies working for you this is a Roots

1687
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:46,480
thing you're not the suits as people

1688
01:09:44,679 --> 01:09:48,319
like to you know you're the roots you're

1689
01:09:46,479 --> 01:09:50,399
you're doing this the best that you can

1690
01:09:48,319 --> 01:09:52,239
and you have a fail like that but you're

1691
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:53,358
going to be righteous for your Instagram

1692
01:09:52,238 --> 01:09:55,959
audience and you're going to tell them

1693
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:59,920
don't worry I threw that 25 ke kilos

1694
01:09:55,960 --> 01:10:03,480
away who the [ __ ] is throwing away 25

1695
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:05,039
kilos of hash just to serve a group of

1696
01:10:03,479 --> 01:10:06,479
people on Instagram who are never going

1697
01:10:05,039 --> 01:10:08,560
to buy that hash whether you were

1698
01:10:06,479 --> 01:10:10,238
radiated it or not so it's this

1699
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:12,760
double-edged sword and you have it with

1700
01:10:10,238 --> 01:10:14,479
CRC as well of course it's great if you

1701
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:17,239
make a nice product but maybe it has a

1702
01:10:14,479 --> 01:10:21,238
little bit of a a slight look to it

1703
01:10:17,238 --> 01:10:22,718
because consumers are so bloody uh picky

1704
01:10:21,238 --> 01:10:25,439
and they're only going to buy something

1705
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:28,239
based on the color and now what oh we

1706
01:10:25,439 --> 01:10:30,559
see our SE it but so it kind of becomes

1707
01:10:28,238 --> 01:10:32,678
are you the company that made that maybe

1708
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:34,600
a fail happened at a lab that wasn't

1709
01:10:32,679 --> 01:10:37,560
even a real fail and you were required

1710
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:39,480
to radiate for this particular reason or

1711
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:41,000
are you the company and this is the part

1712
01:10:39,479 --> 01:10:42,839
that that that you're talking about

1713
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:44,640
Murphy why you kind kind of can't talk

1714
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:46,480
about it why you look bad because

1715
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:48,360
there's brutal [ __ ] companies out

1716
01:10:46,479 --> 01:10:50,279
there that are doing nothing but growing

1717
01:10:48,359 --> 01:10:52,119
moldy schwag they're happy to do it

1718
01:10:50,279 --> 01:10:54,319
because they know they can irradiate it

1719
01:10:52,119 --> 01:10:56,840
at the end of the process so it actually

1720
01:10:54,319 --> 01:10:58,679
affects the so peas in the beginning and

1721
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:59,840
juring because they know where they're

1722
01:10:58,679 --> 01:11:01,359
going is just like it doesn't matter

1723
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:02,920
we're going to CRC and we're going to

1724
01:11:01,359 --> 01:11:05,238
irradiate and we're going to get great

1725
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:07,560
product that's not really what those two

1726
01:11:05,238 --> 01:11:09,599
things were designed to do they were

1727
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:11,280
designed to help people in certain

1728
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:13,120
situations but they become a

1729
01:11:11,279 --> 01:11:15,238
double-edged sword you get people who

1730
01:11:13,119 --> 01:11:16,880
move in with low integrity and then they

1731
01:11:15,238 --> 01:11:18,919
go about doing their business in that

1732
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:20,119
way and so I'll pass it over to Mark

1733
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:21,840
that's all I wanted to say unless you

1734
01:11:20,119 --> 01:11:23,479
had something else to say Murphy Oh I

1735
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:25,520
just want to add you know it's what's

1736
01:11:23,479 --> 01:11:28,319
tricky is we don't have a good way to

1737
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:31,640
evaluate and compare you know the CRC

1738
01:11:28,319 --> 01:11:35,198
gets that complaint about Flavor um but

1739
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:37,039
I always bring up removing the flavor

1740
01:11:35,198 --> 01:11:38,319
that was there might have been important

1741
01:11:37,039 --> 01:11:40,800
the flavor that was there might have

1742
01:11:38,319 --> 01:11:43,079
been gross you know like there's there's

1743
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:45,719
fantastic flour that we can extract and

1744
01:11:43,079 --> 01:11:47,840
get fantastic flavor from and sometimes

1745
01:11:45,719 --> 01:11:50,439
when you get a box of mouse piss weed we

1746
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:53,199
say in exchange for no mouse piss we're

1747
01:11:50,439 --> 01:11:56,039
going to have no other flavor either you

1748
01:11:53,198 --> 01:11:58,439
know and so for us to um

1749
01:11:56,039 --> 01:12:01,319
you know be blamed for the cut when

1750
01:11:58,439 --> 01:12:03,519
we're a Band-Aid is is unfair because we

1751
01:12:01,319 --> 01:12:05,238
should be able to promote you know the

1752
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:07,960
individual components and we get better

1753
01:12:05,238 --> 01:12:10,599
at that as an industry but you know it's

1754
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:13,880
like uh again I I love nicke too but

1755
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:16,039
that that word solventless really took

1756
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:19,319
us back years in

1757
01:12:16,039 --> 01:12:22,079
scientific conversation because we've

1758
01:12:19,319 --> 01:12:24,079
we've tried to create

1759
01:12:22,079 --> 01:12:26,600
separation in where we should have had a

1760
01:12:24,079 --> 01:12:29,158
lot more conversation and a lot more you

1761
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:31,920
know Nuance between each other because

1762
01:12:29,158 --> 01:12:34,039
we all want the best of whatever's there

1763
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:35,880
the only one who would say throw away 25

1764
01:12:34,039 --> 01:12:37,960
kilos of concentrate is someone who

1765
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:41,400
doesn't have it to throw away who didn't

1766
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:43,880
pay for it to be made um so you know I

1767
01:12:41,399 --> 01:12:47,119
believe in recovery you know I believe

1768
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:50,079
in you know reclaiming what you can uh

1769
01:12:47,119 --> 01:12:51,880
but safely and it's it's a really um

1770
01:12:50,079 --> 01:12:54,559
it's a tricky conversation because when

1771
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:56,800
someone makes green bubble hash and

1772
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:58,480
everybody has done it like one time

1773
01:12:56,800 --> 01:13:00,600
it'll happen and then you

1774
01:12:58,479 --> 01:13:01,839
learn but they don't have to live with

1775
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:03,159
that every day and they don't try to

1776
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:06,279
sell that

1777
01:13:03,158 --> 01:13:08,638
because they can't hide it um and you

1778
01:13:06,279 --> 01:13:10,679
know so this is a conversation that we

1779
01:13:08,639 --> 01:13:13,480
all have together I think within the

1780
01:13:10,679 --> 01:13:15,920
solvent like based Community but it

1781
01:13:13,479 --> 01:13:17,839
doesn't really Escape us and it's uh

1782
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:21,119
it's unfair I think to the consumers as

1783
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:22,679
well so CRC has its place for sure but

1784
01:13:21,119 --> 01:13:26,279
unfortunately over the years it's

1785
01:13:22,679 --> 01:13:27,920
definitely ruined BHO because oh for

1786
01:13:26,279 --> 01:13:30,479
sure because we've been running mouse

1787
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:31,960
piss weed you know we allowed Growers to

1788
01:13:30,479 --> 01:13:35,238
give us garbage weed because we could

1789
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:40,198
fix it you know that standard was not

1790
01:13:35,238 --> 01:13:42,839
held yeah and um like I said see like uh

1791
01:13:40,198 --> 01:13:45,719
when I first made the the rosin ship

1792
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:47,560
diamonds years and years ago CRC was a

1793
01:13:45,719 --> 01:13:50,198
big part of it and W1 was the best thing

1794
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:52,639
to do that with so like I said it

1795
01:13:50,198 --> 01:13:55,960
definitely has its place but as far as

1796
01:13:52,639 --> 01:13:58,400
people doing BHO with quality m material

1797
01:13:55,960 --> 01:14:02,039
the CRC has trickled over to everyone

1798
01:13:58,399 --> 01:14:04,399
just thinks everything CRC so like honed

1799
01:14:02,039 --> 01:14:06,000
in on what color it is and people care

1800
01:14:04,399 --> 01:14:08,519
more about the color than the actual

1801
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:12,039
quality of having good

1802
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:13,920
hash you're not wrong we're at you know

1803
01:14:12,039 --> 01:14:16,679
I I would like to add on that because I

1804
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:18,679
saw it from day one when I released the

1805
01:14:16,679 --> 01:14:21,039
bubble bags and started doing the bubble

1806
01:14:18,679 --> 01:14:23,960
hash right I I listen I got lucky guys

1807
01:14:21,039 --> 01:14:26,359
like me and and Nick and Matt rise we

1808
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:27,960
had an old factory sense and a lucky

1809
01:14:26,359 --> 01:14:30,000
ability to be friends with guys like

1810
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:32,600
subcool and people who were growing

1811
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:35,399
spectacular like Second To None cannabis

1812
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:37,039
that was our advantage and so in the

1813
01:14:35,399 --> 01:14:38,599
very early days I you know breeder

1814
01:14:37,039 --> 01:14:40,880
Steve's like hey you want some shish

1815
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:43,440
Berry buddy and I'm making you know five

1816
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:46,079
star hash with just two or three bags

1817
01:14:43,439 --> 01:14:47,678
like who this is crazy so I had access

1818
01:14:46,079 --> 01:14:49,359
to all this incredible hash it was a

1819
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:50,920
very short period of time after I

1820
01:14:49,359 --> 01:14:53,599
started selling bags that I started

1821
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:56,639
getting these questions hey how do I get

1822
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:58,440
my hash to melt like yours I'd be like o

1823
01:14:56,639 --> 01:15:00,159
o h they are not going to like the

1824
01:14:58,439 --> 01:15:01,599
answer to this question well you just

1825
01:15:00,158 --> 01:15:02,879
need to learn about the symbiotic

1826
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:04,600
relationship between the micro

1827
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:06,159
rizosphere and The Roots and the fungi

1828
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:08,159
intelligence that will help Express

1829
01:15:06,158 --> 01:15:09,559
plants and sequester compounds from your

1830
01:15:08,158 --> 01:15:10,679
plants you're just going to need to

1831
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:12,840
learn about that it's going to be about

1832
01:15:10,679 --> 01:15:15,480
a 10 to 20 year Journey that's going to

1833
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:18,639
take you through absolute insanity and

1834
01:15:15,479 --> 01:15:23,039
crop loss and failure and and epiphanies

1835
01:15:18,639 --> 01:15:25,760
and and and all of these things or or

1836
01:15:23,039 --> 01:15:28,359
you could smash a bunch of into a tube

1837
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:31,239
and blast it with a Ronson can and that

1838
01:15:28,359 --> 01:15:33,839
is what 99% of that's why B was taking

1839
01:15:31,238 --> 01:15:35,678
off so fast in the early days because

1840
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:37,760
people who had material with like the

1841
01:15:35,679 --> 01:15:39,840
Bubble Bags just weren't the same as BHO

1842
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:43,280
in the in the early days the Bubble Bags

1843
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:45,159
would give you a nice material even if

1844
01:15:43,279 --> 01:15:49,399
it wasn't melty it could still easily be

1845
01:15:45,158 --> 01:15:51,198
50 plus% THC a and be strong but it just

1846
01:15:49,399 --> 01:15:53,399
it was those melty photos that everyone

1847
01:15:51,198 --> 01:15:55,678
wanted to be a part of it was that melty

1848
01:15:53,399 --> 01:15:57,559
shiny hash that everyone wanted and so

1849
01:15:55,679 --> 01:15:59,920
they'd say how do I get my hashed amount

1850
01:15:57,560 --> 01:16:01,520
like yours and you know the next day

1851
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:04,158
they'd be like [ __ ] it I can p i can

1852
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:07,120
blast this and it will be a golden honey

1853
01:16:04,158 --> 01:16:09,799
oil and so it was the beginning of a way

1854
01:16:07,119 --> 01:16:14,359
to make something that wasn't very good

1855
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:16,880
look good and Marcus yes go ahead please

1856
01:16:14,359 --> 01:16:21,000
uh if you'll recall when you started

1857
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:23,279
Bubble Bas I called you and said hey I

1858
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:27,039
don't want to crush your bubble bag

1859
01:16:23,279 --> 01:16:28,359
business you did you AB did you did and

1860
01:16:27,039 --> 01:16:31,560
I wanted

1861
01:16:28,359 --> 01:16:35,439
to reaffirm that and then one other

1862
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:40,520
thing about roberte is Dr ju uh

1863
01:16:35,439 --> 01:16:43,759
Julian was the head scientist there and

1864
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:45,880
when I wanted to get business with them

1865
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:48,400
I asked him give me something to extract

1866
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:53,119
so he gave me some fouryear

1867
01:16:48,399 --> 01:16:56,158
old uh lavender all dusty in a

1868
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:58,319
box and I extract Ed it and I sent it

1869
01:16:56,158 --> 01:17:00,479
back to him the next thing I know three

1870
01:16:58,319 --> 01:17:02,158
days later I got this frantic phone call

1871
01:17:00,479 --> 01:17:04,959
from this french guy who can hardly

1872
01:17:02,158 --> 01:17:07,679
speak English and he's like how did you

1873
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:10,639
do that what is happening this is better

1874
01:17:07,679 --> 01:17:14,960
than the fresh lavender we want to talk

1875
01:17:10,639 --> 01:17:17,239
with you so I went in roberte and I sat

1876
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:19,319
down and I became friends with Dr Daniel

1877
01:17:17,238 --> 01:17:23,959
Julian who was the head

1878
01:17:19,319 --> 01:17:25,519
scientist he then was so enamored of the

1879
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:29,359
process

1880
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:31,800
that he got on a jet and flew to Kansas

1881
01:17:29,359 --> 01:17:35,920
and walked into the place to sit down

1882
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:37,840
and see the whole setup and he was like

1883
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:39,880
he kept shaking his head he was sitting

1884
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:42,199
there shaking his head and I said Dr

1885
01:17:39,880 --> 01:17:46,679
Julian are you okay and he said yes he

1886
01:17:42,198 --> 01:17:49,279
goes but I want you to know that uh

1887
01:17:46,679 --> 01:17:50,679
you're about 200 years ahead of the

1888
01:17:49,279 --> 01:17:54,079
extraction

1889
01:17:50,679 --> 01:17:55,960
industry and I am so happy to be here

1890
01:17:54,079 --> 01:17:58,079
and see all this and can I see you

1891
01:17:55,960 --> 01:18:01,079
operate at once and I said sure you can

1892
01:17:58,079 --> 01:18:03,479
and we did and we became close friends

1893
01:18:01,079 --> 01:18:05,679
and we still are we still

1894
01:18:03,479 --> 01:18:08,599
talk but

1895
01:18:05,679 --> 01:18:11,440
uh that's awesome that's amazing I want

1896
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:14,000
I want to I have a question for you was

1897
01:18:11,439 --> 01:18:17,039
that company bigger than Jadon

1898
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:19,960
Rouge hey you couldn't tell me don't ask

1899
01:18:17,039 --> 01:18:22,960
me about comparisons bro I don't know

1900
01:18:19,960 --> 01:18:25,439
Julian was they were around the entire

1901
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:30,439
world they sourced stuff and country

1902
01:18:25,439 --> 01:18:31,599
that there was so do Jo Rouge but I I

1903
01:18:30,439 --> 01:18:34,198
don't know

1904
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:36,159
either I can uh I can find that out for

1905
01:18:34,198 --> 01:18:37,839
you I want to continue the thought

1906
01:18:36,158 --> 01:18:41,359
because I wanted to finish and not be

1907
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:43,840
blaming BHO I feel the exact same thing

1908
01:18:41,359 --> 01:18:46,000
happened with Rosen when Rosen was

1909
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:47,239
released uh that happened with and it's

1910
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:50,479
kind of this double-edged sword that

1911
01:18:47,238 --> 01:18:52,759
we're talking about with CRC and with ir

1912
01:18:50,479 --> 01:18:55,638
radiation you know it's like where can I

1913
01:18:52,760 --> 01:18:57,920
find a place for my mediocre product and

1914
01:18:55,639 --> 01:18:59,560
so that was a big thing when BHO

1915
01:18:57,920 --> 01:19:01,199
happened obviously not everyone has

1916
01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:03,480
amazing product the majority of people

1917
01:19:01,198 --> 01:19:05,559
who were blasting had mediocre product

1918
01:19:03,479 --> 01:19:07,198
it was turning into a golden honey oil

1919
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:09,400
and it looked spectacular but it wasn't

1920
01:19:07,198 --> 01:19:12,039
until some of you people on this panel

1921
01:19:09,399 --> 01:19:13,960
started showing people what actual bomb

1922
01:19:12,039 --> 01:19:16,238
product was and adding all these little

1923
01:19:13,960 --> 01:19:19,039
tricks and tips into your Sops to really

1924
01:19:16,238 --> 01:19:22,039
preserve and you know get all of that

1925
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:24,439
goodness in the end result it it just

1926
01:19:22,039 --> 01:19:26,560
was a place for mediocre product to go

1927
01:19:24,439 --> 01:19:28,678
and it was the same thing with rosin to

1928
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:30,120
this day I kind of say about rosin all

1929
01:19:28,679 --> 01:19:32,719
the time and don't get me wrong I love

1930
01:19:30,119 --> 01:19:34,559
rosin I have beautiful rosin here right

1931
01:19:32,719 --> 01:19:37,319
now I've got some honey bananas it's

1932
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:41,039
spectacular it smells so loud and so

1933
01:19:37,319 --> 01:19:43,000
beautiful but I do feel I find that when

1934
01:19:41,039 --> 01:19:46,000
I ask someone if I can see the hash that

1935
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:47,760
they made the Rosen from they never have

1936
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:49,520
it they never want to show it they don't

1937
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:52,679
want to flex it they don't show it on

1938
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:55,480
Instagram so I say the majority of rosin

1939
01:19:52,679 --> 01:19:57,119
is where mediocre hash goes to die

1940
01:19:55,479 --> 01:19:59,959
there's a lot of white rosin with no

1941
01:19:57,119 --> 01:20:01,920
flavor out there and tons tons and the

1942
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:05,520
thing is you get exactly what you ask

1943
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:09,239
for the problem is that if if we have a

1944
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:12,120
lot of tools available to us we can

1945
01:20:09,238 --> 01:20:13,959
deliver on more of those asks so if you

1946
01:20:12,119 --> 01:20:16,279
ask me for a white product a clear

1947
01:20:13,960 --> 01:20:18,239
product a blue product whatever you want

1948
01:20:16,279 --> 01:20:21,039
like I could make a

1949
01:20:18,238 --> 01:20:23,879
thing um and so you have to know what

1950
01:20:21,039 --> 01:20:25,399
you want and ask the right question and

1951
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:26,960
that is a

1952
01:20:25,399 --> 01:20:31,479
pretty

1953
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:33,920
significant ask of a consumer especially

1954
01:20:31,479 --> 01:20:36,759
you know in in a market where we went

1955
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:39,079
from not being able to talk about it to

1956
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:41,440
then not being able to see it smell it

1957
01:20:39,079 --> 01:20:44,119
touch it or interact with it when we buy

1958
01:20:41,439 --> 01:20:45,879
it so it used to be you know that you'd

1959
01:20:44,119 --> 01:20:47,399
at least be able to smell that jar

1960
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:49,880
before you picked up a gram of that

1961
01:20:47,399 --> 01:20:52,599
rosin and now you do have to purchase it

1962
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:55,600
visually so they're going to ask for a

1963
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:58,800
visual cue that's a terrible situation

1964
01:20:55,600 --> 01:21:01,560
if I had to buy my avocados visually my

1965
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:03,920
ability to deliver on good guac would be

1966
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:06,960
diminished you know like sometimes we

1967
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:09,639
just have to identify the real problem

1968
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:11,679
if if you had to smell the product

1969
01:21:09,639 --> 01:21:13,359
before you bought it you'd make a

1970
01:21:11,679 --> 01:21:17,800
different choice but when we have to

1971
01:21:13,359 --> 01:21:19,479
purchase it visually a a dark orange BHO

1972
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:21,440
extract isn't going to look as good as a

1973
01:21:19,479 --> 01:21:23,879
bright white one but I happen to know

1974
01:21:21,439 --> 01:21:27,039
that I have had some absolutely

1975
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:28,600
delightful dark orange B you know like

1976
01:21:27,039 --> 01:21:31,560
and just talking about all of his red

1977
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:33,679
oil like you know the the visual cues

1978
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:34,920
didn't matter when we had others you

1979
01:21:33,679 --> 01:21:37,840
know a lot of people complain about the

1980
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:40,840
THC argument but give me any other

1981
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:42,880
number yeah you know no I'm GNA get to

1982
01:21:40,840 --> 01:21:44,400
mark because he's raised his hands twice

1983
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:47,840
but yeah someone just mentioned in the

1984
01:21:44,399 --> 01:21:50,119
chat oh I agree dude but CRC is Criminal

1985
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:52,400
and another guy's like it's feels sneaky

1986
01:21:50,119 --> 01:21:55,319
but it connects exactly to what you just

1987
01:21:52,399 --> 01:21:57,599
said people are purchasing based on

1988
01:21:55,319 --> 01:21:59,238
their eyes we haven't created that

1989
01:21:57,600 --> 01:22:02,639
system we would love people to be able

1990
01:21:59,238 --> 01:22:05,158
to test it touch it smell it feel it and

1991
01:22:02,639 --> 01:22:07,199
experience it but we can't it has to be

1992
01:22:05,158 --> 01:22:09,559
purchased a certain way now obviously

1993
01:22:07,198 --> 01:22:12,519
you know I'm not a a BHO guy but I I

1994
01:22:09,560 --> 01:22:16,679
just see that when you're and and it's

1995
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:18,239
very similar for um rosin as well and

1996
01:22:16,679 --> 01:22:20,399
this is why people are like let's cut

1997
01:22:18,238 --> 01:22:23,079
the plant down a little early let's make

1998
01:22:20,399 --> 01:22:25,000
sure we liliz and keep it in cold chain

1999
01:22:23,079 --> 01:22:26,359
and make sure we pull like taffy to get

2000
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:29,158
those air bubbles in there to lighten

2001
01:22:26,359 --> 01:22:31,880
that bubble these are forms of CRC these

2002
01:22:29,158 --> 01:22:33,920
are forms of manipulation and sneakiness

2003
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:35,719
that we are you know we're not forced to

2004
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:38,079
do but I say we're kind of business

2005
01:22:35,719 --> 01:22:40,239
people are somewhat forced to do if they

2006
01:22:38,079 --> 01:22:43,399
want to compete in the market and it's

2007
01:22:40,238 --> 01:22:45,119
funny because it's always the buyers the

2008
01:22:43,399 --> 01:22:46,599
people who are the buyers who are saying

2009
01:22:45,119 --> 01:22:48,359
oh I don't like this and that's sneaky

2010
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:50,679
and that well then then start buying

2011
01:22:48,359 --> 01:22:53,319
differently you know pay pay attention

2012
01:22:50,679 --> 01:22:56,399
differently Mark please go ahead all

2013
01:22:53,319 --> 01:23:00,960

2014

in the room who knows a little bit about

2022
01:23:21,039 --> 01:23:25,679
extraction and I think he's got

2023
01:23:23,079 --> 01:23:28,800
something to say

2024
01:23:25,679 --> 01:23:31,920

first um

2033
01:23:56,920 --> 01:24:04,199
when I first came into fully

2034
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:06,119
regulated market making hash I I hash

2035
01:24:04,198 --> 01:24:08,479
was the only way I could get in right I

2036
01:24:06,119 --> 01:24:11,920
couldn't I I couldn't get a badge my

2037
01:24:08,479 --> 01:24:16,519
dear friend uh fellow cultivator you

2038
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:19,000
know Phil Ha was like hey hey hey Billy

2039
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:21,560
we can hire you as a consultant and you

2040
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:23,560
come back here and make some some hash

2041
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:26,480
for us and then you you get to come and

2042
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:30,400
play right and

2043
01:24:26,479 --> 01:24:32,718
um when we first set the machine up I

2044
01:24:30,399 --> 01:24:34,759
was talking to gidy up the the founder

2045
01:24:32,719 --> 01:24:37,760
emotech and who who I kind of developed

2046
01:24:34,760 --> 01:24:39,039
L resin with and he was like you know

2047
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:43,760
something you're G to find out

2048
01:24:39,039 --> 01:24:46,279
immediately bill is it's the Grower's

2049
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:48,600
fault if it's good and it's your fault

2050
01:24:46,279 --> 01:24:52,719
if it's bad get used to that [ __ ] right

2051
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:55,280
now this is your world and you know I I

2052
01:24:52,719 --> 01:24:57,639
I I consider myself to be

2053
01:24:55,279 --> 01:24:59,960
at least that good at at cultivating

2054
01:24:57,639 --> 01:25:02,840
cannabis as I have been at extracting it

2055
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:06,239
and and and fortunate that I learned on

2056
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:10,840
exceptional material so this was a like

2057
01:25:06,238 --> 01:25:14,479
a new world for me to come into the um

2058
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:17,760
this meant trash in and we want gold out

2059
01:25:14,479 --> 01:25:22,158
right and then you know live

2060
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:25,760
resin in those early days man we didn't

2061
01:25:22,158 --> 01:25:28,719
Harvest rooms for it we walked really

2062
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:32,400
big exceptionally grown rooms and picked

2063
01:25:28,719 --> 01:25:36,520
the five six seven best plants of each

2064
01:25:32,399 --> 01:25:40,039
cultivar and myself and and like a a Ry

2065
01:25:36,520 --> 01:25:43,080
Pritchard or Phil he level of careful

2066
01:25:40,039 --> 01:25:44,760
harvested those plants very particularly

2067
01:25:43,079 --> 01:25:47,359
and and and it was taken care of that

2068
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:50,000
way all the way through this was the top

2069
01:25:47,359 --> 01:25:51,759
cut it was only supposed to be that

2070
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:55,279
within you

2071
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:56,800
know maybe three weeks owners came to me

2072
01:25:55,279 --> 01:25:58,279
and were like hey we got a room full of

2073
01:25:56,800 --> 01:26:02,639
aens can we

2074
01:25:58,279 --> 01:26:06,800
freeze it's like [ __ ] and and I

2075
01:26:02,639 --> 01:26:06,800
knew this was mindful

2076
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:13,319
yeah I knew that was coming from the

2077
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:16,679
first run honestly when I opened the

2078
01:26:13,319 --> 01:26:19,559
first pot of live resin I had a few a

2079
01:26:16,679 --> 01:26:22,399
series of thoughts that weren't around

2080
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:23,920
the quality my very first thought was

2081
01:26:22,399 --> 01:26:27,039
like wow I'm going to be able to figure

2082
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:27,039
out never trim

2083
01:26:27,198 --> 01:26:31,158
again I was like we're freezing

2084
01:26:29,279 --> 01:26:35,158
everything I'm [ __ ] out of the trim

2085
01:26:31,158 --> 01:26:39,039
game right my my second thought was like

2086
01:26:35,158 --> 01:26:40,679
wow this is special and good people are

2087
01:26:39,039 --> 01:26:44,760
probably GNA fight about

2088
01:26:40,679 --> 01:26:47,679
this and then my my third thought I was

2089
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:49,960
like wow I guarantee someone is gonna

2090
01:26:47,679 --> 01:26:52,158
figure out how to use this to to to make

2091
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:56,039
something bad yeah know I mean because

2092
01:26:52,158 --> 01:26:59,439
it looks so amazing you can right away

2093
01:26:56,039 --> 01:27:01,960
out of the gate use this as as a tool of

2094
01:26:59,439 --> 01:27:05,238
Destruction and and and it happened you

2095
01:27:01,960 --> 01:27:06,679
know reliably fast as commercially

2096
01:27:05,238 --> 01:27:11,279
driven things

2097
01:27:06,679 --> 01:27:14,920
do um but hey everybody on this panel as

2098
01:27:11,279 --> 01:27:17,158
a capability of producing you know

2099
01:27:14,920 --> 01:27:19,600
ridiculous quality setting standards

2100
01:27:17,158 --> 01:27:23,319
refusing

2101
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:25,280
material I I'm I'm that guy I don't see

2102
01:27:23,319 --> 01:27:27,079
as much trash people know I'm going to

2103
01:27:25,279 --> 01:27:29,079
ask them why the hell they think it's

2104
01:27:27,079 --> 01:27:33,479
good and they're going to have to

2105
01:27:29,079 --> 01:27:35,039
explain to me so uh you know Mark and I

2106
01:27:33,479 --> 01:27:37,000
were talking about this on the way over

2107
01:27:35,039 --> 01:27:41,960
here I was like I'm I I don't want to

2108
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:44,359
reward that bad behavior on the flip

2109
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:47,079
side all of these separation and

2110
01:27:44,359 --> 01:27:49,158
purification techniques open up a whole

2111
01:27:47,079 --> 01:27:51,800
bunch of cool new products and ability

2112
01:27:49,158 --> 01:27:53,960
to formulate and and do things with

2113
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:58,560
product that couldn't be used and and

2114
01:27:53,960 --> 01:28:02,439
that that's why it's awesome uh same I'm

2115
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:04,520
stoked that rosin blew up the solv on

2116
01:28:02,439 --> 01:28:08,719
the scene because the accessibility for

2117
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:13,000
a small producer to single source and do

2118
01:28:08,719 --> 01:28:16,118
a craft thing went up but I do think

2119
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:18,800
rousin CRC for Ms I ask everybody that's

2120
01:28:16,118 --> 01:28:21,158
why I got my buddy trainer here he came

2121
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:23,760
to me with melts and rosin and fresh

2122
01:28:21,158 --> 01:28:27,399
breast the the day I met him and I was

2123

2169
01:30:24,279 --> 01:30:28,759
saying and ask a question for the group

2170
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:31,400
like has solvent extraction actually

2171
01:30:28,760 --> 01:30:33,320
just found its niche in turning garbage

2172
01:30:31,399 --> 01:30:35,799
to Gold because I know like there's a

2173
01:30:33,319 --> 01:30:38,439
few of you guys that uh you know you

2174
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:41,279
came into this game looking for like

2175
01:30:38,439 --> 01:30:44,039
that like that personal stash and trying

2176
01:30:41,279 --> 01:30:46,719
to trying to like figure out how you can

2177
01:30:44,039 --> 01:30:48,479
get the absolute best quality stuff but

2178
01:30:46,719 --> 01:30:50,198
there's also like stories in the group

2179
01:30:48,479 --> 01:30:53,638
of like hey you

2180
01:30:50,198 --> 01:30:56,158
know process process Innovation was done

2181
01:30:53,639 --> 01:30:57,800
through like you know we had this batch

2182
01:30:56,158 --> 01:30:59,799
that that just didn't work out and

2183
01:30:57,800 --> 01:31:01,560
that's actually how I started as well is

2184
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:04,440
like I I was looking I was using bubble

2185
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:06,960
bags to uh try and get hash out of out

2186
01:31:04,439 --> 01:31:12,039
of the trimmings for my grow and that's

2187
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:15,480
how I found um how I found uh uh grey

2188
01:31:12,039 --> 01:31:18,319
wolf grey Wolf's work and um grey wolf

2189
01:31:15,479 --> 01:31:20,799
was hugely influential for me in uh in

2190
01:31:18,319 --> 01:31:24,158
kind of building those first cloth Loop

2191
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:25,920
systems um but one of the like the

2192
01:31:24,158 --> 01:31:28,319
untapped potential at that time was

2193
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:30,000
everybody was throwing their trim away

2194
01:31:28,319 --> 01:31:32,599
and nobody had anything that they could

2195
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:33,800
do with their trim and BH was actually

2196
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:35,679
something that you could do that you

2197
01:31:33,800 --> 01:31:37,520
could make you could make shatter out of

2198
01:31:35,679 --> 01:31:40,480
out of uh trimmings that people were

2199
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:42,400
just throwing in the garbage and um but

2200
01:31:40,479 --> 01:31:44,158
you see this theme kind of continue and

2201
01:31:42,399 --> 01:31:45,519
carry through to today and people get

2202
01:31:44,158 --> 01:31:48,079
getting better and better at making

2203
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:49,520
something that's marketable out of um

2204
01:31:48,079 --> 01:31:51,118
out of you know either a Grower's

2205
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:53,639
mistake or something that maybe doesn't

2206
01:31:51,118 --> 01:31:55,679
have as much commercial value yeah I

2207
01:31:53,639 --> 01:31:58,239
feel like a lot of the things that

2208
01:31:55,679 --> 01:32:00,079
happened has happened out of mistakes

2209
01:31:58,238 --> 01:32:01,799
and learning from things like that but

2210
01:32:00,079 --> 01:32:03,920
it's like it's the more places I've been

2211
01:32:01,800 --> 01:32:06,279
the more you you need to be able to find

2212
01:32:03,920 --> 01:32:08,319
a place for everything that that is

2213
01:32:06,279 --> 01:32:10,359
grown everything you don't want to waste

2214
01:32:08,319 --> 01:32:12,198
anything exactly as a business

2215
01:32:10,359 --> 01:32:14,279
especially as it gets more competitive

2216
01:32:12,198 --> 01:32:17,399
part of what we have to be able to do is

2217
01:32:14,279 --> 01:32:19,118
be able to find a place for things that

2218
01:32:17,399 --> 01:32:20,519
you know because there's always you know

2219
01:32:19,118 --> 01:32:21,960
depending on the size of grow that

2220
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:24,400
you're working with you know we work

2221
01:32:21,960 --> 01:32:26,560
with a really big one up here um you

2222
01:32:24,399 --> 01:32:28,319
know it just depends on what part of it

2223
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:31,039
like the trim or you know I used to have

2224
01:32:28,319 --> 01:32:32,840
people trim wet so I could just get the

2225
01:32:31,039 --> 01:32:35,679
the trim you know do live resin with

2226
01:32:32,840 --> 01:32:38,520
trim because that was a much better

2227
01:32:35,679 --> 01:32:40,079
thing for me and it came out so nice you

2228
01:32:38,520 --> 01:32:42,119
know so much nicer than when you you

2229
01:32:40,079 --> 01:32:44,439
know have it dried and I used to do that

2230
01:32:42,118 --> 01:32:46,799
for a long time but yeah a lot of it

2231
01:32:44,439 --> 01:32:48,439
really just come came from mistakes

2232
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:50,440
things like that you know like I said to

2233
01:32:48,439 --> 01:32:52,079
burn myself to all that stuff but you

2234
01:32:50,439 --> 01:32:53,519
know when I have to do consultations

2235
01:32:52,079 --> 01:32:55,800
things like that you you really need to

2236
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:57,199
be able ble to work with what you have

2237
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:58,600
so it's like you know or else you go out

2238
01:32:57,198 --> 01:33:00,678
of business and then all the people the

2239
01:32:58,600 --> 01:33:02,400
families and friends you bring in who

2240
01:33:00,679 --> 01:33:04,359
you want to take care of because it's

2241
01:33:02,399 --> 01:33:05,638
been you've been in business long enough

2242
01:33:04,359 --> 01:33:07,599
to where people have you know thrown

2243
01:33:05,639 --> 01:33:09,880
everything they have into it and you

2244
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:12,360
really need to be able to come up with

2245
01:33:09,880 --> 01:33:14,279
options for when you know like let's say

2246
01:33:12,359 --> 01:33:16,238
the weather's bad or things freeze or

2247
01:33:14,279 --> 01:33:18,279
things happen you know especially

2248
01:33:16,238 --> 01:33:20,000
outdoor grows things like that you have

2249
01:33:18,279 --> 01:33:22,238
to be able to figure out something or

2250
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:24,639
else you go out of business and so

2251
01:33:22,238 --> 01:33:27,079
failure failure's important but the rate

2252
01:33:24,639 --> 01:33:29,840
of failure I think is also pretty

2253
01:33:27,079 --> 01:33:31,920
relevant here and I think that's where

2254
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:35,520
prohibition comes into play Because when

2255
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:39,158
it was Prohibition everywhere everyone

2256
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:41,280
kind of developed at a similar Pace like

2257
01:33:39,158 --> 01:33:44,158
there would be one or two people who

2258
01:33:41,279 --> 01:33:47,079
showed up to Amsterdam and [ __ ] [ __ ]

2259
01:33:44,158 --> 01:33:49,439
up but like it wasn't everyone showing

2260
01:33:47,079 --> 01:33:51,639
up with the new version of everything it

2261
01:33:49,439 --> 01:33:53,879
was a lot of people showing up with

2262
01:33:51,639 --> 01:33:58,000
their version of the same strain right

2263
01:33:53,880 --> 01:34:00,400
like even you know the the proliferation

2264
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:03,600
um of the way we cultivate a lot of that

2265
01:34:00,399 --> 01:34:06,319
you know happened at at such a slower

2266
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:08,199
Pace under prohibition but at such a

2267
01:34:06,319 --> 01:34:10,559
more consistent pace and what I have

2268
01:34:08,198 --> 01:34:13,799
found really interesting you know I've

2269
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:16,880
been um you know training people on new

2270
01:34:13,800 --> 01:34:21,199
systems and Consulting for a very long

2271
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:24,679
time now and every new market goes

2272
01:34:21,198 --> 01:34:25,559
through the exact same [ __ ] it we do

2273
01:34:24,679 --> 01:34:29,079
not

2274
01:34:25,560 --> 01:34:31,320
learn from our mistakes every new market

2275
01:34:29,079 --> 01:34:33,359
comes in with wax and shatter again

2276
01:34:31,319 --> 01:34:35,679
before they get live resin and diamonds

2277
01:34:33,359 --> 01:34:38,359
again and it's like we all have the same

2278
01:34:35,679 --> 01:34:40,800
extractors no there hasn't been much

2279
01:34:38,359 --> 01:34:45,000
Innovation on stainless steel tubes in a

2280
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:47,440
long time um but you know what that

2281
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:49,479
shows me is that we can only you know

2282
01:34:47,439 --> 01:34:52,039
innovate as fast as the

2283
01:34:49,479 --> 01:34:53,799
flower and so it's that rate of failure

2284
01:34:52,039 --> 01:34:56,399
their cultivators have to get better

2285
01:34:53,800 --> 01:34:58,600
fail more to improve and then the

2286
01:34:56,399 --> 01:35:01,198
extractors have to get that exposure you

2287
01:34:58,600 --> 01:35:03,800
know it's like almost that 10,000 hours

2288
01:35:01,198 --> 01:35:05,238
sort of perspective where it's like you

2289
01:35:03,800 --> 01:35:08,520
need 10

2290
01:35:05,238 --> 01:35:12,279
runs that came out the same and 10 that

2291
01:35:08,520 --> 01:35:14,600
came out un expected before you know you

2292
01:35:12,279 --> 01:35:16,399
know how the next 20 are going to go you

2293
01:35:14,600 --> 01:35:20,280
know with any real experience under your

2294
01:35:16,399 --> 01:35:23,439
belt and I think prohibition has made it

2295
01:35:20,279 --> 01:35:25,599
um you know this funny cycle where we're

2296
01:35:23,439 --> 01:35:28,238
going see the exact you know if if

2297
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:30,679
France starts you know implementing new

2298
01:35:28,238 --> 01:35:33,799
facilities they're going to grow some

2299
01:35:30,679 --> 01:35:35,679
basic low potency swag and some really

2300
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:37,199
average homogeneous lowf flavor

2301
01:35:35,679 --> 01:35:39,319
concentrates like we're they're going to

2302
01:35:37,198 --> 01:35:41,399
do the same things and they're going to

2303
01:35:39,319 --> 01:35:43,279
slowly go they're going to make a hard

2304
01:35:41,399 --> 01:35:47,879
candy like we don't you know like we

2305
01:35:43,279 --> 01:35:50,800
just do the same stuff over and over and

2306
01:35:47,880 --> 01:35:52,960
uh you know part of that I think is you

2307
01:35:50,800 --> 01:35:55,079
know not to put it all on the consumers

2308
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:57,079
but the consumer consumers are in the

2309
01:35:55,079 --> 01:36:00,238
best position to say we don't have to

2310
01:35:57,079 --> 01:36:03,000
start over from the beginning give us

2311
01:36:00,238 --> 01:36:05,000
what they have start today you know I

2312
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:07,000
love learning about the history of it

2313
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:08,760
but um but I think the consumers should

2314
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:10,719
demand the current

2315
01:36:08,760 --> 01:36:13,440
version well let's talk about the

2316
01:36:10,719 --> 01:36:17,000
consumer too right like there's a reason

2317
01:36:13,439 --> 01:36:18,759
why uh the demand for you know lower

2318
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:21,319
lower and product is higher because

2319
01:36:18,760 --> 01:36:23,920
people have a budget and so if you can

2320
01:36:21,319 --> 01:36:26,279
provide that that uh you know a better

2321
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:28,079
experience through using maybe CRC or

2322
01:36:26,279 --> 01:36:31,000
using some Advanced kind of techniques

2323
01:36:28,079 --> 01:36:33,279
to turn garbage to Gold you can present

2324
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:34,920
an option for these consumers that you

2325
01:36:33,279 --> 01:36:36,559
know like maybe it's better value for

2326
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:38,560
them and they're making a choice

2327
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:39,400
consciously that you know that they they

2328
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:42,360
just

2329
01:36:39,399 --> 01:36:44,599
want they know they know that that's why

2330
01:36:42,359 --> 01:36:46,198
they buy it look like I remember

2331
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:48,000
thinking carts are never going to catch

2332
01:36:46,198 --> 01:36:50,638
on who would want that it's so expensive

2333
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:53,920
it ruins the oil why would it work and I

2334
01:36:50,639 --> 01:36:56,719
was so wrong you know I'll never I'll

2335
01:36:53,920 --> 01:36:59,319
never be able you know to go back to the

2336
01:36:56,719 --> 01:37:01,158
days when carts weren't the only way you

2337
01:36:59,319 --> 01:37:04,759
could make a profit you know producing

2338
01:37:01,158 --> 01:37:06,439
oil in the regulated market and you know

2339
01:37:04,760 --> 01:37:09,320
that's the consumer saying we'd rather

2340
01:37:06,439 --> 01:37:11,719
have it be more convenient than be more

2341
01:37:09,319 --> 01:37:14,158
flavorful so some of it is we have to

2342
01:37:11,719 --> 01:37:16,679
listen they do tell us what they want

2343
01:37:14,158 --> 01:37:19,759
and we and we say but what if it could

2344
01:37:16,679 --> 01:37:21,239
be good in our you know margin of

2345
01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:24,520
production puts ourselves out of

2346
01:37:21,238 --> 01:37:28,158
business like maybe we do have to just

2347
01:37:24,520 --> 01:37:30,320
Embrace that some people like mids we're

2348
01:37:28,158 --> 01:37:30,319
not

2349
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:36,960
just we're we're in a commodity Market

2350
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:40,000
where where price and cost of goods sold

2351
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:42,000
is going to always win and so the 800

2352
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:46,118
pound gorilla in the room is that it's

2353
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:49,599
cheaper to chemically convert CBD into

2354
01:37:46,118 --> 01:37:52,359
THC than it is to extract THC from

2355
01:37:49,599 --> 01:37:55,119
cannabis plants so with that being in

2356
01:37:52,359 --> 01:37:58,000
the room I mean all that hemp derived D9

2357
01:37:55,118 --> 01:38:00,719
that's out there is all from chemical

2358
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:03,158
conversion not from fractionation of

2359
01:38:00,719 --> 01:38:06,439
mother liquor yeah so let's face it

2360
01:38:03,158 --> 01:38:08,759
we're in a commodity industry here where

2361
01:38:06,439 --> 01:38:11,919
price is always going to win and like

2362
01:38:08,760 --> 01:38:14,440
Bill said people drink Budweiser I bet

2363
01:38:11,920 --> 01:38:16,960
you on this crew here people would

2364
01:38:14,439 --> 01:38:19,079
rather prefer like a headyy IPA

2365
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:22,239
something locally brewed and Artisan

2366
01:38:19,079 --> 01:38:25,399
product but yeah the bigger addressable

2367
01:38:22,238 --> 01:38:29,479
Market and you know look at moves that

2368
01:38:25,399 --> 01:38:33,079
the the msos have made all big msos are

2369
01:38:29,479 --> 01:38:35,279
now getting into the hemp space Wana now

2370
01:38:33,079 --> 01:38:38,760
has a hemp thing I think this hemp thing

2371
01:38:35,279 --> 01:38:41,319
is completely taken the market out and

2372
01:38:38,760 --> 01:38:42,599
maybe sucked the little wind out of the

2373
01:38:41,319 --> 01:38:45,359
high quality

2374
01:38:42,599 --> 01:38:49,039
end well it's that next it's that next

2375
01:38:45,359 --> 01:38:51,319
level right um okay so Ryan Telly had

2376
01:38:49,039 --> 01:38:53,599
his hand up I just I was gonna say one

2377
01:38:51,319 --> 01:38:55,319
thing prior but I think it might have oh

2378
01:38:53,599 --> 01:38:57,840
when Adam was talking about the early

2379
01:38:55,319 --> 01:39:00,799
days turning trash into stash I used the

2380
01:38:57,840 --> 01:39:02,880
exact same term that term has changed a

2381
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:04,560
little bit I'm when I said trash to

2382
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:07,079
stash back in the day like that trim was

2383
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:10,480
amazing it made Five Star Plus bubble

2384
01:39:07,079 --> 01:39:14,679
hash um trash into stash doesn't have to

2385
01:39:10,479 --> 01:39:16,238
mean like Mouse soaked urine soaked you

2386
01:39:14,679 --> 01:39:18,000
know what I mean like that's a we need

2387
01:39:16,238 --> 01:39:19,718
to be careful with the language that we

2388
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:22,039
speak of course what Adam is speaking of

2389
01:39:19,719 --> 01:39:24,319
when he does say trash to Gold yes you

2390
01:39:22,039 --> 01:39:26,359
can take material that's not not as good

2391
01:39:24,319 --> 01:39:28,279
as maybe you know that's lost a lot of

2392
01:39:26,359 --> 01:39:29,880
its margin that you can take you can

2393
01:39:28,279 --> 01:39:32,039
clean up a little M make it an

2394
01:39:29,880 --> 01:39:33,440
affordable product and this is this is

2395
01:39:32,039 --> 01:39:35,000
the difficulty look I'm sure the

2396
01:39:33,439 --> 01:39:36,439
majority of the people on this panel if

2397
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:38,079
we could we'd make it so everyone was

2398
01:39:36,439 --> 01:39:41,638
smoking the greatest product in the

2399
01:39:38,079 --> 01:39:44,079
world but not everyone has the money or

2400
01:39:41,639 --> 01:39:45,840
wants to put their money towards that

2401
01:39:44,079 --> 01:39:48,000
the same way that we do so then it

2402
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:49,599
becomes a market that if you want I'd

2403
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:51,679
rather see all those extractors get

2404
01:39:49,599 --> 01:39:54,400
health insurance you know like we all

2405
01:39:51,679 --> 01:39:57,118
have a stake in this

2406
01:39:54,399 --> 01:39:58,960
and I think we you know what we need to

2407
01:39:57,118 --> 01:40:01,880
do is is really

2408
01:39:58,960 --> 01:40:04,039
embrace our position in you know in

2409
01:40:01,880 --> 01:40:06,880
these roles because like Mark said if if

2410
01:40:04,039 --> 01:40:08,840
the goal is cheapest D9 if customers say

2411
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:11,400
I want the cheapest D9 that's what I

2412
01:40:08,840 --> 01:40:14,560
need that's what I'm going to spend 80%

2413
01:40:11,399 --> 01:40:16,238
of my money at the dispensary on then we

2414
01:40:14,560 --> 01:40:17,920
can scale that up in a way that puts

2415
01:40:16,238 --> 01:40:20,158
less people at risk so that the people

2416
01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:22,639
who want to do really cool flavorful

2417
01:40:20,158 --> 01:40:24,638
stuff can hold their Market you know a

2418
01:40:22,639 --> 01:40:27,118
crap Brewer doesn't try to compete with

2419
01:40:24,639 --> 01:40:28,840
Budweiser they don't have to compare

2420
01:40:27,118 --> 01:40:31,399
themselves to Budweiser it would be

2421
01:40:28,840 --> 01:40:33,480
weird to they're not the

2422
01:40:31,399 --> 01:40:36,198
same

2423
01:40:33,479 --> 01:40:38,678
right yeah that's one thing I want to

2424
01:40:36,198 --> 01:40:42,039
make sure is like while you know we may

2425
01:40:38,679 --> 01:40:44,480
have found the niche in in being able to

2426
01:40:42,039 --> 01:40:47,118
be the good Recyclers of the industry I

2427
01:40:44,479 --> 01:40:50,399
want to make sure we're not relegated to

2428
01:40:47,118 --> 01:40:53,880
that position because you know that's

2429
01:40:50,399 --> 01:40:57,158
something that that like has always been

2430
01:40:53,880 --> 01:40:59,400
my goal is to is to just get to the

2431
01:40:57,158 --> 01:41:02,079
middle of the Tricom you know like strip

2432
01:40:59,399 --> 01:41:05,079
away the cuticle the you know the

2433
01:41:02,079 --> 01:41:07,679
secretory cells I just want to get to

2434
01:41:05,079 --> 01:41:10,158
just the pure o as pure of the oil as I

2435
01:41:07,679 --> 01:41:13,679
can and and on my Journeys I've found

2436
01:41:10,158 --> 01:41:16,198
that to be butane extraction and uh and

2437
01:41:13,679 --> 01:41:18,880
I find it to be you know like when when

2438
01:41:16,198 --> 01:41:21,598
you have great weed and and you know I

2439
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:24,118
consider a good hash maker a good hash

2440
01:41:21,599 --> 01:41:26,560
maker is only as good as their ability

2441
01:41:24,118 --> 01:41:28,079
to grow or curate good material to me

2442
01:41:26,560 --> 01:41:30,599
you know like if you want to talk about

2443
01:41:28,079 --> 01:41:33,079
like at the highest level you know of

2444
01:41:30,599 --> 01:41:36,000
like you know competition hashm when it

2445
01:41:33,079 --> 01:41:38,639
comes to like you know solventless or

2446
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:40,319
solvent it really comes down to your

2447
01:41:38,639 --> 01:41:42,920
understanding of Canabis at that point

2448
01:41:40,319 --> 01:41:45,359
as just like an you know as as a

2449
01:41:42,920 --> 01:41:48,359
cultivator and you know at an intuitive

2450
01:41:45,359 --> 01:41:50,719
level um so I just want to make sure

2451
01:41:48,359 --> 01:41:52,559
that like that's that's put in this

2452
01:41:50,719 --> 01:41:54,359
conversation here because I know like

2453
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:56,119
Yari and a couple other couple other

2454
01:41:54,359 --> 01:41:58,679
people probably probably want to make

2455
01:41:56,118 --> 01:42:02,079
sure he said that because Yari is a

2456
01:41:58,679 --> 01:42:05,279
hybrid living soil single Source all the

2457
01:42:02,079 --> 01:42:06,840
way to the end and he crushes it so yeah

2458
01:42:05,279 --> 01:42:09,519
I remember selling him commercial

2459
01:42:06,840 --> 01:42:12,119
equipment and it [ __ ] up his oil and

2460
01:42:09,520 --> 01:42:13,960
like like I remember that it was weird

2461
01:42:12,118 --> 01:42:15,118
to hear that story again today because

2462
01:42:13,960 --> 01:42:17,319
like I haven't thought about it in a

2463
01:42:15,118 --> 01:42:21,158
while but I think about that a lot where

2464
01:42:17,319 --> 01:42:23,719
people are ruining their own product you

2465
01:42:21,158 --> 01:42:25,719
know by trying to adapt to way that the

2466
01:42:23,719 --> 01:42:29,118
market wants us to do it you know and I

2467
01:42:25,719 --> 01:42:31,679
think there's so much opportunity to

2468
01:42:29,118 --> 01:42:33,279
innovate you know when we can we can

2469
01:42:31,679 --> 01:42:35,440
really focus on what our goal is if

2470
01:42:33,279 --> 01:42:38,238
every extraction is a

2471
01:42:35,439 --> 01:42:41,198
experiment then you know you can do good

2472
01:42:38,238 --> 01:42:44,158
science and not prove your hypothesis

2473
01:42:41,198 --> 01:42:46,879
but like have a goal before you start

2474
01:42:44,158 --> 01:42:49,279
and to make fire does not count that's

2475
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:51,239
not a goal like that's not all of it's

2476
01:42:49,279 --> 01:42:53,840
going to catch on fire so that's not

2477
01:42:51,238 --> 01:42:55,678
really a you know the goal has to be

2478
01:42:53,840 --> 01:42:58,800
more specific than that if the goal is

2479
01:42:55,679 --> 01:43:00,679
make the cheapest D9 get your efficiency

2480
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:02,599
numbers up I could be the most efficient

2481
01:43:00,679 --> 01:43:05,359
at extracting cannaboids I could be the

2482
01:43:02,599 --> 01:43:08,119
most efficient at extracting tpin I

2483
01:43:05,359 --> 01:43:11,039
could be the fastest you know but a lot

2484
01:43:08,118 --> 01:43:13,359
of people look at saying I have the

2485
01:43:11,039 --> 01:43:16,719
coldest solvent tank they measure things

2486
01:43:13,359 --> 01:43:19,920
that are weird and extraneous instead of

2487
01:43:16,719 --> 01:43:24,359
um you know their ability to achieve

2488
01:43:19,920 --> 01:43:26,639
their you know intended output

2489
01:43:24,359 --> 01:43:28,439
and Murphy I wasn't I wasn't uh using

2490
01:43:26,639 --> 01:43:30,800
that as like like knocking on you you

2491
01:43:28,439 --> 01:43:33,079
help me as much as I as you oh I know I

2492
01:43:30,800 --> 01:43:36,320
just remember not being able to solve it

2493
01:43:33,079 --> 01:43:40,118
and it's I still don't

2494
01:43:36,319 --> 01:43:41,840
like yeah so but I mean uh what Telly

2495
01:43:40,118 --> 01:43:44,960
brought up is a good point and like that

2496
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:47,560
is the I am I'm on a much smaller scale

2497
01:43:44,960 --> 01:43:49,679
than I'd say probably most of you but me

2498
01:43:47,560 --> 01:43:51,360
doing everything on my own and being in

2499
01:43:49,679 --> 01:43:53,239
control of all of it I can see all the

2500
01:43:51,359 --> 01:43:55,279
variables when something works better

2501
01:43:53,238 --> 01:43:56,799
something doesn't work better all the

2502
01:43:55,279 --> 01:43:58,559
things that I've learned have been from

2503
01:43:56,800 --> 01:44:01,159
all of my own mistakes with all of my

2504
01:43:58,560 --> 01:44:03,119
own material so doing all those things

2505
01:44:01,158 --> 01:44:05,960
over the year has got me to the point

2506
01:44:03,118 --> 01:44:07,960
where there is no trash there is no mess

2507
01:44:05,960 --> 01:44:10,000
ups there is no bad stuff anymore

2508
01:44:07,960 --> 01:44:13,800
because I've already failed every way

2509
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:16,840
that you possibly can so um but being

2510
01:44:13,800 --> 01:44:18,719
control of the Clones uh making a tissue

2511
01:44:16,840 --> 01:44:21,159
culture room growing everything and

2512
01:44:18,719 --> 01:44:23,439
living soil I'm on my 58th round of the

2513
01:44:21,158 --> 01:44:26,559
same soil so it's been 10 years in same

2514
01:44:23,439 --> 01:44:29,839
dirt um all those things contribute

2515
01:44:26,560 --> 01:44:31,560
to hunting the best tpping I've done

2516
01:44:29,840 --> 01:44:33,639
side by sides with people that grow rock

2517
01:44:31,560 --> 01:44:36,960
wall we've got the same cuts the turps

2518
01:44:33,639 --> 01:44:40,560
just come out better in living soil so

2519
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:43,920
um not FL call to buy your stuff

2520
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:46,840
buddy I appreciate it

2521
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:49,719
yeah hey Yari can you talk about some of

2522
01:44:46,840 --> 01:44:52,719
the cuts what what are you running now

2523
01:44:49,719 --> 01:44:54,560
um I've got tons of cuts um there's a

2524
01:44:52,719 --> 01:44:57,158
lot of stuff that I've been growing for

2525
01:44:54,560 --> 01:44:58,760
like 15 years uh that I've that I've

2526
01:44:57,158 --> 01:45:00,359
just kept around and then there's always

2527
01:44:58,760 --> 01:45:03,520
new stuff that we're trying out and my

2528
01:45:00,359 --> 01:45:05,598
circle of friends is the same but um I

2529
01:45:03,520 --> 01:45:08,440
have an eight Lightroom and a nine

2530
01:45:05,599 --> 01:45:10,920
Lightroom and I try and do one new

2531
01:45:08,439 --> 01:45:13,279
strain not one new one but one strain

2532
01:45:10,920 --> 01:45:15,880
per table so that I just always have

2533
01:45:13,279 --> 01:45:18,399
like the the biggest variety of flavors

2534
01:45:15,880 --> 01:45:21,440
and some are Staples and then I'm always

2535
01:45:18,399 --> 01:45:23,039
peppering new ones but there's a lot and

2536
01:45:21,439 --> 01:45:26,000
what what I've been seeing that's pretty

2537
01:45:23,039 --> 01:45:27,760
interesting is that although I'd say

2538
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:30,319
some of the newer Generations once the

2539
01:45:27,760 --> 01:45:32,159
candy and the gas and all the hype stuff

2540
01:45:30,319 --> 01:45:34,599
there's a lot of people that when I do

2541
01:45:32,158 --> 01:45:35,879
these old school ones they're gone as as

2542
01:45:34,599 --> 01:45:37,599
as soon as I tell somebody they're

2543
01:45:35,880 --> 01:45:39,800
available they're out the door

2544
01:45:37,599 --> 01:45:42,960
Strawberry Cough the four Collins cut

2545
01:45:39,800 --> 01:45:44,119
Super Lemon Hayes uh grape Cola that's

2546
01:45:42,960 --> 01:45:46,719
probably one of the oldest ones that

2547
01:45:44,118 --> 01:45:50,319
I've done like there's I probably have I

2548
01:45:46,719 --> 01:45:52,520
think 40 or 50 cultivars in the in the

2549
01:45:50,319 --> 01:45:53,559
grow room right now so there there's a

2550
01:45:52,520 --> 01:45:58,440
lot

2551
01:45:53,560 --> 01:46:01,199
um and and going going back to things um

2552
01:45:58,439 --> 01:46:03,719
it's interesting because we were talking

2553
01:46:01,198 --> 01:46:05,479
about colors of stuff and like it seems

2554
01:46:03,719 --> 01:46:08,599
like the consumers

2555
01:46:05,479 --> 01:46:11,319
dictating what they want and it's not

2556
01:46:08,599 --> 01:46:13,400
really like the the best outcome like

2557
01:46:11,319 --> 01:46:15,559
everyone's so hyped on this white rosin

2558
01:46:13,399 --> 01:46:18,000
when people are pulling it at six weeks

2559
01:46:15,560 --> 01:46:20,320
the plant isn't even close to getting to

2560
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:21,760
its maturity to really produce the the

2561
01:46:20,319 --> 01:46:23,519
best that it can especially on the

2562
01:46:21,760 --> 01:46:26,159
turpine level so

2563
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:28,480
it's pretty strange like like that that

2564
01:46:26,158 --> 01:46:31,238
is dictating people are more concerned

2565
01:46:28,479 --> 01:46:34,079
on like the color versus like the flavor

2566
01:46:31,238 --> 01:46:36,879
and the experience of the actual hash

2567
01:46:34,079 --> 01:46:38,880
itself that's always been a hard thing

2568
01:46:36,880 --> 01:46:41,279
as far as quality versus what people

2569
01:46:38,880 --> 01:46:43,159
want what I consider like what I like to

2570
01:46:41,279 --> 01:46:45,359
smoke versus what I find other people

2571
01:46:43,158 --> 01:46:47,399
care about tend to be different things

2572
01:46:45,359 --> 01:46:49,519
and it always surprised me as I went

2573
01:46:47,399 --> 01:46:51,519
through the business of like how is it

2574
01:46:49,520 --> 01:46:53,560
that you don't want the best flavor

2575
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:55,880
thing whether it looks

2576
01:46:53,560 --> 01:46:57,520
yellow or not you know to me that was

2577
01:46:55,880 --> 01:47:01,000
always the thing was the flavor and like

2578
01:46:57,520 --> 01:47:02,800
the nose like what that's not what

2579
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,599
people care about necessarily sometimes

2580
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:05,880
it's

2581
01:47:03,599 --> 01:47:07,319
strength sometimes it's not even smell

2582
01:47:05,880 --> 01:47:09,679
because they have kids or they don't

2583
01:47:07,319 --> 01:47:11,759
want something that has a strong smell

2584
01:47:09,679 --> 01:47:13,840
you know so it there is a definitely a

2585
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:16,079
market for everything it seems like but

2586
01:47:13,840 --> 01:47:19,079
yeah the super high quality stuff it's

2587
01:47:16,079 --> 01:47:20,840
um sometimes not as sought after in

2588
01:47:19,079 --> 01:47:23,639
certain markets well I think we just

2589
01:47:20,840 --> 01:47:25,079
lack the language forids

2590
01:47:23,639 --> 01:47:28,079
well you don't you

2591
01:47:25,079 --> 01:47:31,479
also you've negated the education as

2592
01:47:28,079 --> 01:47:32,840
well right in the sense that people go

2593
01:47:31,479 --> 01:47:35,718
and buy your product they don't

2594
01:47:32,840 --> 01:47:38,239
necessarily know what each product is

2595
01:47:35,719 --> 01:47:41,039
nor the extraction process that got it

2596
01:47:38,238 --> 01:47:43,279
there right and most people have waited

2597
01:47:41,039 --> 01:47:45,439
to see what the market dictates as

2598
01:47:43,279 --> 01:47:47,158
opposed to putting out the diversity

2599
01:47:45,439 --> 01:47:49,198
because of the cost right you can't run

2600
01:47:47,158 --> 01:47:51,079
a whole bunch of different SKS package

2601
01:47:49,198 --> 01:47:53,638
them and get them out the door right so

2602
01:47:51,079 --> 01:47:57,519
these are real world situ situations

2603
01:47:53,639 --> 01:48:00,319
where the market itself educated itself

2604
01:47:57,520 --> 01:48:02,840
as opposed to y'all educating the market

2605
01:48:00,319 --> 01:48:05,279
correct which is for the most part kind

2606
01:48:02,840 --> 01:48:07,800
of an opposite way of doing things but

2607
01:48:05,279 --> 01:48:10,238
the market followed but the

2608
01:48:07,800 --> 01:48:11,960
understanding of what quality is and the

2609
01:48:10,238 --> 01:48:13,519
different levels of production I think

2610
01:48:11,960 --> 01:48:15,359
is still something missing to the

2611
01:48:13,520 --> 01:48:17,599
average consumer because we at the

2612
01:48:15,359 --> 01:48:19,319
dispensaries are still Fielding lots of

2613
01:48:17,599 --> 01:48:22,079
questions they still don't understand

2614
01:48:19,319 --> 01:48:24,599
the extraction or they're still afraid

2615
01:48:22,079 --> 01:48:27,359
because it say BHO on it right and then

2616
01:48:24,599 --> 01:48:29,279
you've all dealt with the repercussions

2617
01:48:27,359 --> 01:48:31,079
of oh you're evil bad and pushing

2618
01:48:29,279 --> 01:48:32,840
petrochemical Bad Evil [ __ ] and they

2619
01:48:31,079 --> 01:48:35,118
don't understand this is the same

2620
01:48:32,840 --> 01:48:36,800
process that your coffee is decaffinated

2621
01:48:35,118 --> 01:48:39,118
with okay that you've been drinking for

2622
01:48:36,800 --> 01:48:41,360
decades so stop with the fear

2623
01:48:39,118 --> 01:48:44,359
mongering and understand the different

2624
01:48:41,359 --> 01:48:46,319
levels of process right because the

2625
01:48:44,359 --> 01:48:49,118
dispensaries don't have the Educational

2626
01:48:46,319 --> 01:48:51,039
Tools nor have we been given them it's

2627
01:48:49,118 --> 01:48:53,279
something we've had to self-educate to

2628
01:48:51,039 --> 01:48:56,319
take forward so

2629
01:48:53,279 --> 01:48:59,880
how do each one of you decide which

2630
01:48:56,319 --> 01:49:02,319
products SK you take forward in a new

2631
01:48:59,880 --> 01:49:05,440
market that's a challenge and a question

2632
01:49:02,319 --> 01:49:08,719
into itself and usually usually that's

2633
01:49:05,439 --> 01:49:10,759
not an extractor making that decision

2634
01:49:08,719 --> 01:49:15,039
unfortunately you know guys we wouldn't

2635
01:49:10,760 --> 01:49:17,920
have had live res sorry Kelly go ahead

2636
01:49:15,039 --> 01:49:20,279
nobody wanted that [ __ ] I I they were

2637
01:49:17,920 --> 01:49:23,158
like what the [ __ ] is this it looks

2638
01:49:20,279 --> 01:49:26,920
weird how come it doesn't shine it gets

2639
01:49:23,158 --> 01:49:28,319
my jar sticky yep nobody wanted it but

2640
01:49:26,920 --> 01:49:32,079
how do you use it

2641
01:49:28,319 --> 01:49:35,000
righte it but we I I was working at a

2642
01:49:32,079 --> 01:49:37,960
place that had nine stores we had a

2643
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:41,118
vertical so we were able to train Bud

2644
01:49:37,960 --> 01:49:43,480
tenders to be like just close your eyes

2645
01:49:41,118 --> 01:49:46,198
and smell this and decide if you want

2646
01:49:43,479 --> 01:49:47,678
this or not and people wanted it when

2647
01:49:46,198 --> 01:49:50,839
they smelled it you know what I mean

2648
01:49:47,679 --> 01:49:53,800
when I showed when I met Mark I showed

2649
01:49:50,840 --> 01:49:56,960
him a pretty fat jar of dog's Walts I'm

2650
01:49:53,800 --> 01:49:58,840
kind of s eying him right now gave him a

2651
01:49:56,960 --> 01:50:00,399
sniff he grabbed a rat out of my hands

2652
01:49:58,840 --> 01:50:02,199
and stuck his fingers in there and stuck

2653
01:50:00,399 --> 01:50:06,759
it in his mouth because he was so

2654
01:50:02,198 --> 01:50:09,399
overwhelmed by how like and I was like

2655
01:50:06,760 --> 01:50:11,760
back and forth whether I hated or loved

2656
01:50:09,399 --> 01:50:14,359
him for being able to do that decided

2657
01:50:11,760 --> 01:50:17,520
love it was the soft serve ice cream of

2658
01:50:14,359 --> 01:50:19,639
weed come on now that's that's a

2659
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:22,040
privilege of Colorado though I will say

2660
01:50:19,639 --> 01:50:25,480
is we have always maintained the ability

2661
01:50:22,039 --> 01:50:29,000
to have a Le product for people to smell

2662
01:50:25,479 --> 01:50:32,559
there are lots of places that it the bug

2663
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:35,238
tender has never smelled it it is so

2664
01:50:32,560 --> 01:50:38,159
sealed up and individually packaged the

2665
01:50:35,238 --> 01:50:40,839
person who grew it has no idea what that

2666
01:50:38,158 --> 01:50:44,479
final nitrogen packed Tin Can smells

2667
01:50:40,840 --> 01:50:46,239
like so that you know that data point

2668
01:50:44,479 --> 01:50:48,118
consumers are using every piece of

2669
01:50:46,238 --> 01:50:52,959
information we give them and what we

2670
01:50:48,118 --> 01:50:55,439
give them is flashy packaging weight THC

2671
01:50:52,960 --> 01:50:58,198
and maybe a picture of it you know and

2672
01:50:55,439 --> 01:51:00,158
so it's like giving them the the

2673
01:50:58,198 --> 01:51:02,279
language to ask for what they want a lot

2674
01:51:00,158 --> 01:51:05,198
of them would say they want more flavor

2675
01:51:02,279 --> 01:51:08,319
a lot of them would you know make a a

2676
01:51:05,198 --> 01:51:10,678
sacrifice for you know a lower potency

2677
01:51:08,319 --> 01:51:13,359
and more broad flavor if the price point

2678
01:51:10,679 --> 01:51:16,239
fit but like we've got to use every

2679
01:51:13,359 --> 01:51:18,960
piece of data and and we give them so

2680
01:51:16,238 --> 01:51:23,479
few you know because what we say to each

2681
01:51:18,960 --> 01:51:26,078
other about it is like the strain name

2682
01:51:23,479 --> 01:51:28,479
because we intuitively know like oh you

2683
01:51:26,078 --> 01:51:30,880
have some papaya melt yes I do want to

2684
01:51:28,479 --> 01:51:32,638
see that every time you know like oh you

2685
01:51:30,880 --> 01:51:34,400
have honey banana melt yeah I'll take a

2686
01:51:32,639 --> 01:51:36,279
look at that every time I know that if

2687
01:51:34,399 --> 01:51:37,879
I'm looking for gas like every once in a

2688
01:51:36,279 --> 01:51:40,198
while I run into some people who always

2689
01:51:37,880 --> 01:51:43,599
have sour diesel wax and let me tell you

2690
01:51:40,198 --> 01:51:47,238
something that Sour Diesel wax is still

2691
01:51:43,599 --> 01:51:49,920
the fire and the fire is a useless

2692
01:51:47,238 --> 01:51:51,959
phrase but it it's the one that means a

2693
01:51:49,920 --> 01:51:55,760
lot to all of us you know we've all

2694
01:51:51,960 --> 01:51:58,719
learned and defined what that fire is

2695
01:51:55,760 --> 01:52:00,320
consumers you know don't have that same

2696
01:51:58,719 --> 01:52:04,480
recognition a lot of us who want that

2697
01:52:00,319 --> 01:52:07,399
fire will still smoke a like clean

2698
01:52:04,479 --> 01:52:09,238
sourced cart when we're on vacation at a

2699
01:52:07,399 --> 01:52:10,759
Thanksgiving family dinner because we

2700
01:52:09,238 --> 01:52:12,839
all

2701
01:52:10,760 --> 01:52:15,679
recognize you know that there's a time

2702
01:52:12,840 --> 01:52:18,880
and place for everything you know I we a

2703
01:52:15,679 --> 01:52:20,599
lot of us have our drawer like a wine

2704
01:52:18,880 --> 01:52:22,520
offish andado would have a seller of a

2705
01:52:20,599 --> 01:52:24,039
fancy bottle that we just have and I've

2706
01:52:22,520 --> 01:52:26,000
about this little half gram of some

2707
01:52:24,039 --> 01:52:28,198
special stuff that I take a little dab

2708
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:31,158
of from time to time and save for

2709
01:52:28,198 --> 01:52:33,279
Nostalgia so you know the the language

2710
01:52:31,158 --> 01:52:35,439
of how we share that with consumers is

2711
01:52:33,279 --> 01:52:37,800
really lacking and within the solvent

2712
01:52:35,439 --> 01:52:39,960
space it's it's

2713
01:52:37,800 --> 01:52:41,480
usually a lot of us saying we want

2714
01:52:39,960 --> 01:52:43,840
education but then a marketing

2715
01:52:41,479 --> 01:52:46,919
department who is detached from both

2716
01:52:43,840 --> 01:52:50,800
cultivation and extraction the

2717
01:52:46,920 --> 01:52:52,800
enemy sales the enemy Marshall wanted to

2718
01:52:50,800 --> 01:52:54,480
chime in but before he did I you know we

2719
01:52:52,800 --> 01:52:56,199
were talking about color and I just it

2720
01:52:54,479 --> 01:52:58,598
was going on in my head and I thought

2721
01:52:56,198 --> 01:53:01,638
wasn't it Bob Marley who said until the

2722
01:52:58,599 --> 01:53:04,719
color of a man's hash is of no more

2723
01:53:01,639 --> 01:53:06,319
significance than the color of his eyes

2724
01:53:04,719 --> 01:53:08,679
had to had to drop that one because I

2725
01:53:06,319 --> 01:53:10,279
was feeling it and uh Marshall continue

2726
01:53:08,679 --> 01:53:12,960
the conversation oh I also wanted to

2727
01:53:10,279 --> 01:53:14,960
thank etan for coming in you know I was

2728
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:19,039
really trying to keep the panel today

2729
01:53:14,960 --> 01:53:21,639
really sort of um you know oil and hash

2730
01:53:19,039 --> 01:53:23,399
oriented but I think atan brings a

2731
01:53:21,639 --> 01:53:25,199
really great persp perspective from that

2732
01:53:23,399 --> 01:53:27,598
dispensary perspective as we're talking

2733
01:53:25,198 --> 01:53:29,479
about the customer and I don't know if

2734
01:53:27,599 --> 01:53:32,319
you guys heard it as loud as I did but I

2735
01:53:29,479 --> 01:53:34,678
heard there's a great disconnect between

2736
01:53:32,319 --> 01:53:36,519
the processors and the dispensaries who

2737
01:53:34,679 --> 01:53:38,679
are selling their products and I think

2738
01:53:36,520 --> 01:53:41,000
Murphy made a good point that that is

2739
01:53:38,679 --> 01:53:43,440
that marketing department that steps in

2740
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:46,198
and has no connectivity to either of

2741
01:53:43,439 --> 01:53:48,359
these uh uh processes so uh Marshall

2742
01:53:46,198 --> 01:53:49,879
please go ahead yeah thanks I know I

2743
01:53:48,359 --> 01:53:52,158
don't have the experience in this

2744
01:53:49,880 --> 01:53:54,039
industry like you guys do at all but I

2745
01:53:52,158 --> 01:53:56,039
just wanted to give you guys my personal

2746
01:53:54,039 --> 01:53:57,319
perspective on this because I have you

2747
01:53:56,039 --> 01:53:58,760
know had pieces of it here and there

2748
01:53:57,319 --> 01:54:00,679
anyway I grew up in Utah very

2749
01:53:58,760 --> 01:54:03,599
conservative right never thought i'

2750
01:54:00,679 --> 01:54:05,319
cannabis legal in any state let alone

2751
01:54:03,599 --> 01:54:07,119
many of them I'm living in Washington

2752
01:54:05,319 --> 01:54:09,880
now Washington's one of the states where

2753
01:54:07,118 --> 01:54:13,399
you cannot open any the packaging you

2754
01:54:09,880 --> 01:54:15,118
can't do anything with it but look at it

2755
01:54:13,399 --> 01:54:17,000
and uh I mean you can smell the whole

2756
01:54:15,118 --> 01:54:19,439
store right because it's smells good in

2757
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:21,279
there but also then in between living in

2758
01:54:19,439 --> 01:54:23,678
Utah and now Washington I lived in

2759
01:54:21,279 --> 01:54:26,759
Humble for 6 years seven years roughly

2760
01:54:23,679 --> 01:54:29,118
on and off and so I knew people growing

2761
01:54:26,760 --> 01:54:30,760
and I could go get it from them or hang

2762
01:54:29,118 --> 01:54:33,238
out with them or whatever so I think

2763
01:54:30,760 --> 01:54:34,679
maybe I was spoiled from that experience

2764
01:54:33,238 --> 01:54:37,678
in comparison to what I have here in

2765
01:54:34,679 --> 01:54:39,399
Washington I do not go to the rec shops

2766
01:54:37,679 --> 01:54:41,920
anymore in fact I've actually almost

2767
01:54:39,399 --> 01:54:44,238
nearly stopped smoking because I can't

2768
01:54:41,920 --> 01:54:46,800
go to the store get something that I

2769
01:54:44,238 --> 01:54:49,279
want I throw it away I thrown away

2770
01:54:46,800 --> 01:54:51,679
thousands of dollars worth of products

2771
01:54:49,279 --> 01:54:53,279
because I smoke it once and I throw it

2772
01:54:51,679 --> 01:54:55,560
away because there something wrong with

2773
01:54:53,279 --> 01:54:57,439
it after seeing the way you know people

2774
01:54:55,560 --> 01:55:00,119
growing it personally and seeing what

2775
01:54:57,439 --> 01:55:01,799
their products come out from that I I

2776
01:55:00,118 --> 01:55:04,719
don't know what they're doing I don't

2777
01:55:01,800 --> 01:55:07,560
know why it's so different for me but I

2778
01:55:04,719 --> 01:55:11,840
can't I can'tjust it so this also comes

2779
01:55:07,560 --> 01:55:15,520
back to the uh synthetic right making D9

2780
01:55:11,840 --> 01:55:17,520
from from uh hemp I currently work at a

2781
01:55:15,520 --> 01:55:21,560
large hemp extraction facility we s

2782
01:55:17,520 --> 01:55:23,280
drones of ethanol and CO2 extract and it

2783
01:55:21,560 --> 01:55:25,599
hurts me person personally to know that

2784
01:55:23,279 --> 01:55:27,000
this is now what's going on is that we

2785
01:55:25,599 --> 01:55:29,480
could be selling this to somebody they

2786
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:31,238
could then be making it into D9 that

2787
01:55:29,479 --> 01:55:34,559
could be then going into a distillate

2788
01:55:31,238 --> 01:55:37,559
with fake tpin added to it and then sold

2789
01:55:34,560 --> 01:55:39,639
literally as live resin carts right in

2790
01:55:37,560 --> 01:55:41,119
the shop and you don't know and you

2791
01:55:39,639 --> 01:55:42,319
can't even when you go to the website

2792
01:55:41,118 --> 01:55:46,359
they'll tell you they're doing something

2793
01:55:42,319 --> 01:55:48,519
else I can analytically very easily tell

2794
01:55:46,359 --> 01:55:50,039
you whether or not that's real I can

2795
01:55:48,520 --> 01:55:53,280
taste it and tell you whether not it's

2796
01:55:50,039 --> 01:55:55,359
real pretty immediately if anybody has

2797
01:55:53,279 --> 01:55:56,960
you know wants any help trying to help

2798
01:55:55,359 --> 01:55:59,679
battle this like to me I don't

2799
01:55:56,960 --> 01:56:01,359
understand where the market struggles

2800
01:55:59,679 --> 01:56:03,960
then these other synthetics become

2801
01:56:01,359 --> 01:56:05,439
cheaper people start using them how do

2802
01:56:03,960 --> 01:56:07,158
we deal with this like I said the the

2803
01:56:05,439 --> 01:56:09,198
idea of growing up in Utah where it was

2804
01:56:07,158 --> 01:56:12,078
so conservative right we're in this

2805
01:56:09,198 --> 01:56:14,960
place where it's now and all I see it is

2806
01:56:12,078 --> 01:56:16,279
destroying itself and uh anyway so if

2807
01:56:14,960 --> 01:56:18,359
there's anything I can do to help

2808
01:56:16,279 --> 01:56:20,559
analytically sensory anything any of

2809
01:56:18,359 --> 01:56:23,359
this stuff please reach out to me

2810
01:56:20,560 --> 01:56:26,159
because I believe in all this stuff

2811
01:56:23,359 --> 01:56:28,598
being medicine and also just personally

2812
01:56:26,158 --> 01:56:30,039
enjoyable from sensory and experience

2813
01:56:28,599 --> 01:56:32,000
everything else like that and I struggle

2814
01:56:30,039 --> 01:56:34,158
to see what's already happened to it

2815
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:35,520
here in Washington so can you analyze

2816
01:56:34,158 --> 01:56:38,598
and quantify

2817
01:56:35,520 --> 01:56:40,360
flavonoids uh I cannot personally right

2818
01:56:38,599 --> 01:56:42,360
now but I do have a lab every single

2819
01:56:40,359 --> 01:56:44,439
person I have asked for 10 years says

2820
01:56:42,359 --> 01:56:47,639
that well I mean I have a lab couple

2821
01:56:44,439 --> 01:56:50,000
blocks from my work where I can for sure

2822
01:56:47,639 --> 01:56:51,800
I think that's a huge opportunity for us

2823
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:54,719
that we're missing even when we started

2824
01:56:51,800 --> 01:56:57,639
being able to test for tpin it was good

2825
01:56:54,719 --> 01:56:59,920
info but all of us recognized that the

2826
01:56:57,639 --> 01:57:02,239
tpine number was too low based on our

2827
01:56:59,920 --> 01:57:05,800
experience like the volume of the flavor

2828
01:57:02,238 --> 01:57:09,598
part versus number that's the color the

2829
01:57:05,800 --> 01:57:12,880
color is not likely canono the color is

2830
01:57:09,599 --> 01:57:15,920
probably and if we name them and

2831
01:57:12,880 --> 01:57:18,639
quantify them yeah you got to remember

2832
01:57:15,920 --> 01:57:21,199
too in the plant there's two parts to a

2833
01:57:18,639 --> 01:57:23,199
flavonoid there's a glycoside there's a

2834
01:57:21,198 --> 01:57:25,879
sugar portion and then there's What's

2835
01:57:23,198 --> 01:57:27,879
called the aglycone so typically by the

2836
01:57:25,880 --> 01:57:31,199
time you've gotten to extraction or

2837
01:57:27,880 --> 01:57:32,840
you're getting to uh uh distillation

2838
01:57:31,198 --> 01:57:36,759
you're certainly only dealing with the

2839
01:57:32,840 --> 01:57:39,159
agly cones and those are really super um

2840
01:57:36,760 --> 01:57:42,520
colored so they're very high Extinction

2841
01:57:39,158 --> 01:57:45,679
coefficients so a very little bit will

2842
01:57:42,520 --> 01:57:47,719
color a whole big batch but the other

2843
01:57:45,679 --> 01:57:50,158
thing I wanted to go back to was the cat

2844
01:57:47,719 --> 01:57:52,760
piss you know think about it or mice

2845
01:57:50,158 --> 01:57:58,078
piss uh mice piss

2846
01:57:52,760 --> 01:58:00,679
or yeah mice urine right is water

2847
01:57:58,078 --> 01:58:04,519
soluble right so if it was oil soluble

2848
01:58:00,679 --> 01:58:07,279
it would still be inside the mouse so um

2849
01:58:04,520 --> 01:58:10,040
if you are extracting and you're using a

2850
01:58:07,279 --> 01:58:12,039
a non-polar hydrocarbon yeah you're not

2851
01:58:10,039 --> 01:58:14,039
going to get all the water soluble crap

2852
01:58:12,039 --> 01:58:16,599
that was in the mice piss right because

2853
01:58:14,039 --> 01:58:18,439
that's all water soluble right and if it

2854
01:58:16,599 --> 01:58:21,639
was fat soluble it would still be in the

2855
01:58:18,439 --> 01:58:23,198
mouse right John that's right and you

2856
01:58:21,639 --> 01:58:25,719
you know

2857
01:58:23,198 --> 01:58:27,158
before we uh travel off in another

2858
01:58:25,719 --> 01:58:28,239
Direction because I'm starting to run

2859
01:58:27,158 --> 01:58:31,598
out of

2860
01:58:28,238 --> 01:58:36,319
steam there's a

2861
01:58:31,599 --> 01:58:38,960
hash a turpan that nobody really has

2862
01:58:36,319 --> 01:58:40,479
been able to extract successfully in any

2863
01:58:38,960 --> 01:58:44,198
large amount called

2864
01:58:40,479 --> 01:58:47,319
hasine you heard of that I guess but

2865
01:58:44,198 --> 01:58:50,960
anyway people find it an extremely old

2866
01:58:47,319 --> 01:58:53,439
hash and they can meta out the hashen

2867
01:58:50,960 --> 01:58:55,920
name which is a very syrupy golden

2868
01:58:53,439 --> 01:58:58,719
liquid that tastes like the best hash

2869
01:58:55,920 --> 01:59:03,158
you've never had in your mouth ever but

2870
01:58:58,719 --> 01:59:06,679
I have discovered a way to make it

2871
01:59:03,158 --> 01:59:08,399
happen and what we did was we took uh

2872
01:59:06,679 --> 01:59:09,920
five pounds

2873
01:59:08,399 --> 01:59:14,039
of

2874
01:59:09,920 --> 01:59:17,639
uh a certain kind of oil uh train wreck

2875
01:59:14,039 --> 01:59:21,479
and we froze it in a nitrogen freezer

2876
01:59:17,639 --> 01:59:24,920
for maybe 3 years at the end of those

2877
01:59:21,479 --> 01:59:29,919
three years I pulled that out put it in

2878
01:59:24,920 --> 01:59:32,920
the uh vacuum oven and passed it into a

2879
01:59:29,920 --> 01:59:36,199
collection device which I got off of I

2880
01:59:32,920 --> 01:59:40,560
can't remember who now but

2881
01:59:36,198 --> 01:59:43,359
uh the this thing would collect in tiny

2882
01:59:40,560 --> 01:59:47,440
droplets as the rest of the oil was

2883
01:59:43,359 --> 01:59:51,319
going by and that would be hashen and I

2884
01:59:47,439 --> 01:59:54,719
found out that if you do five pounds of

2885
01:59:51,319 --> 01:59:58,359
the uh train wreck that you can end up

2886
01:59:54,719 --> 02:00:01,000
getting about a quarter pound of this

2887
01:59:58,359 --> 02:00:03,639
hasine and I didn't want to see that

2888
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:05,760
disappear into the ether because I don't

2889
02:00:03,639 --> 02:00:08,520
know of anybody else that looked into it

2890
02:00:05,760 --> 02:00:11,480
or anything so I

2891
02:00:08,520 --> 02:00:14,280
wanted there was a paper published in

2892
02:00:11,479 --> 02:00:16,919
2011 by a group over in Switzerland I

2893
02:00:14,279 --> 02:00:21,118
think of all places and they they found

2894
02:00:16,920 --> 02:00:23,920
it only in the areas of hash that were

2895
02:00:21,118 --> 02:00:26,880
exposed to sunlight and so the same

2896
02:00:23,920 --> 02:00:29,279
group basically that identified hasinine

2897
02:00:26,880 --> 02:00:31,118
they did used all the analytical

2898
02:00:29,279 --> 02:00:33,000
chemistry you know Mass Spectrum and all

2899
02:00:31,118 --> 02:00:36,039
that kind of stuff identified the

2900
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:38,800
molecule they also postulated how it was

2901
02:00:36,039 --> 02:00:43,479
being formed again in a photolytic

2902
02:00:38,800 --> 02:00:45,520
reaction of mine so mine can absorb a

2903
02:00:43,479 --> 02:00:48,118
photon and when it does it becomes an

2904
02:00:45,520 --> 02:00:50,440
excited state and rearranges into

2905
02:00:48,118 --> 02:00:53,598
hasinine and so yeah that paper was

2906
02:00:50,439 --> 02:00:56,799
published in 201 11 I

2907
02:00:53,599 --> 02:00:59,560
believe hey Mark are they now finding it

2908
02:00:56,800 --> 02:01:02,039
inh that that sees really deep vacuum

2909
02:00:59,560 --> 02:01:04,039
for extended periods of time as well I

2910
02:01:02,039 --> 02:01:06,078
don't know are they not because I

2911
02:01:04,039 --> 02:01:10,399
thought they were finding it in like

2912
02:01:06,078 --> 02:01:14,439
these like cold long cold shatters

2913
02:01:10,399 --> 02:01:16,879
too um perhaps yeah yeah that that I

2914
02:01:14,439 --> 02:01:19,638
could be totally wrong I S I read

2915
02:01:16,880 --> 02:01:23,319
something on that and maybe

2916
02:01:19,639 --> 02:01:26,639
2014 as as far as I know know hasinine

2917
02:01:23,319 --> 02:01:28,679
has never been proven to modulate or

2918
02:01:26,639 --> 02:01:31,599
potentiate

2919
02:01:28,679 --> 02:01:35,000
THC no you don't get high off smoking it

2920
02:01:31,599 --> 02:01:38,319
at all it just is an amazing flavor a

2921
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:40,319
turpan Beyond Turpin that's all nobody

2922
02:01:38,319 --> 02:01:43,158
you you can smoke all of it you want you

2923
02:01:40,319 --> 02:01:45,439
won't get high I took it with me to uh

2924
02:01:43,158 --> 02:01:49,960
Emerald cup one of the first or second

2925
02:01:45,439 --> 02:01:52,078
ones and at one of the booths I ladled

2926
02:01:49,960 --> 02:01:55,000
some into a couple of pipes because

2927
02:01:52,078 --> 02:02:00,039
everybody was asking because at that

2928
02:01:55,000 --> 02:02:02,760
time I was being observed quite a lot so

2929
02:02:00,039 --> 02:02:04,760
I put some hasine in the pipes and the

2930
02:02:02,760 --> 02:02:07,679
next thing you know we had a group of a

2931
02:02:04,760 --> 02:02:13,320
hundred people follow us around and real

2932
02:02:07,679 --> 02:02:15,880
cup all one some guy named Chance was

2933
02:02:13,319 --> 02:02:18,238
pushing me in the chair that I was in

2934
02:02:15,880 --> 02:02:20,319
and he would go to a new booth and go

2935
02:02:18,238 --> 02:02:22,839
hey indra's here and then 100 people

2936
02:02:20,319 --> 02:02:25,279
gather around the we everybody wanted

2937
02:02:22,840 --> 02:02:28,159
some of that Hine even though they

2938
02:02:25,279 --> 02:02:29,559
weren't getting high on it it was a an

2939
02:02:28,158 --> 02:02:32,078
incredible

2940
02:02:29,560 --> 02:02:34,079
flavor something that's not to be missed

2941
02:02:32,078 --> 02:02:38,479
if you can I still have about a quarter

2942
02:02:34,078 --> 02:02:42,359
ounce of it in my freezer and in a jar

2943
02:02:38,479 --> 02:02:44,678
and I I take it out when I when I end up

2944
02:02:42,359 --> 02:02:47,158
buying crappy weed from a shop or

2945
02:02:44,679 --> 02:02:50,840
something I pull the hashen A out and

2946
02:02:47,158 --> 02:02:53,839
dose it with that dude that's

2947
02:02:50,840 --> 02:02:58,078
sneaky but if you keep if you keep

2948
02:02:53,840 --> 02:03:00,920
passing around for decades then it turns

2949
02:02:58,078 --> 02:03:04,439
into something

2950
02:03:00,920 --> 02:03:07,719
else well hear your voice I'm gonna

2951
02:03:04,439 --> 02:03:07,719
smoke some hay in your

2952
02:03:07,840 --> 02:03:14,119
honor res cart question uh so live

2953
02:03:11,880 --> 02:03:16,840
resent carts have hit the scene for a

2954
02:03:14,118 --> 02:03:19,439
hot minute now do any of you guys make

2955
02:03:16,840 --> 02:03:21,480
live resin carts and how much HT do you

2956
02:03:19,439 --> 02:03:22,719
actually use to call it a live resin

2957
02:03:21,479 --> 02:03:26,279
cart

2958
02:03:22,719 --> 02:03:28,719
like probably like a third to 40% I'd

2959
02:03:26,279 --> 02:03:32,319
say something like

2960
02:03:28,719 --> 02:03:34,679
that I do 70% HD for oh see that's what

2961
02:03:32,319 --> 02:03:35,960
I would prefer I like just straight just

2962
02:03:34,679 --> 02:03:38,239
like that straight I don't even like the

2963
02:03:35,960 --> 02:03:40,719
Melt mix for p my personal stuff I just

2964
02:03:38,238 --> 02:03:45,158
like the super turpy but you know that's

2965
02:03:40,719 --> 02:03:48,480
like I just use the GC and um dose it by

2966
02:03:45,158 --> 02:03:52,319
uh total turpine content and you use

2967
02:03:48,479 --> 02:03:56,118
just TS use HTE so it's HTE but um

2968
02:03:52,319 --> 02:03:58,359
because I fraction everything I can pull

2969
02:03:56,118 --> 02:04:02,198
you know lighter and heavier back

2970
02:03:58,359 --> 02:04:03,399
together and so you know to start with I

2971
02:04:02,198 --> 02:04:06,799
wouldn't call it

2972
02:04:03,399 --> 02:04:09,118
HTE if you've got you know anything over

2973
02:04:06,800 --> 02:04:11,960
I would say 20% at the most but you know

2974
02:04:09,118 --> 02:04:14,598
10% would be ideal of dissolved

2975
02:04:11,960 --> 02:04:18,198
cannaboids in it so you know a lot of

2976
02:04:14,599 --> 02:04:21,239
people call things HTE that are really

2977
02:04:18,198 --> 02:04:23,198
you know nearly 40% still other

2978
02:04:21,238 --> 02:04:26,558
cannaboid thca and stuff that's

2979
02:04:23,198 --> 02:04:29,158
dissolved um and so for it to be you

2980
02:04:26,559 --> 02:04:30,880
know clean enough and high enough Purity

2981
02:04:29,158 --> 02:04:33,960
you've still got flavonoids You' still

2982
02:04:30,880 --> 02:04:36,279
got Esters you know all kinds of oily

2983
02:04:33,960 --> 02:04:39,520
things compared to like the you know

2984
02:04:36,279 --> 02:04:41,639
really more volatile TPS and so when I

2985
02:04:39,520 --> 02:04:45,199
just aim for that specific tpping

2986
02:04:41,639 --> 02:04:47,359
content because my HT is all very watery

2987
02:04:45,198 --> 02:04:50,879
because of fractioned it I know that

2988
02:04:47,359 --> 02:04:54,039
it's you know going to be almost 40%

2989
02:04:50,880 --> 02:04:57,239
tping and then you know another 20% of

2990
02:04:54,039 --> 02:04:59,920
that other category um because a lot of

2991
02:04:57,238 --> 02:05:01,519
people are putting out even again now

2992
02:04:59,920 --> 02:05:03,639
back to the language issue we call it

2993
02:05:01,520 --> 02:05:07,320
high turpine extract but some people's

2994
02:05:03,639 --> 02:05:10,359
High turpine extract is 7%

2995
02:05:07,319 --> 02:05:12,158
tpes and so you know they could put that

2996
02:05:10,359 --> 02:05:14,238
100% in the cart and it still wouldn't

2997
02:05:12,158 --> 02:05:15,759
have the flavor profile you know and

2998
02:05:14,238 --> 02:05:18,558
some people's High turpine extract

2999
02:05:15,760 --> 02:05:20,039
they're decarbing and heating and so

3000
02:05:18,559 --> 02:05:22,800
they've changed that

3001
02:05:20,039 --> 02:05:25,158
profile in a ways that Mark would love

3002
02:05:22,800 --> 02:05:27,199
to nerd out about probably for us you

3003
02:05:25,158 --> 02:05:28,479
know and the rearrangement and you know

3004
02:05:27,198 --> 02:05:31,198
how some of those are going to change

3005
02:05:28,479 --> 02:05:33,718
and so you know the way we even Define

3006
02:05:31,198 --> 02:05:36,479
HTE is still really vague because high

3007
02:05:33,719 --> 02:05:39,719
should have a minimum threshold I would

3008
02:05:36,479 --> 02:05:43,039
think but what send me

3009
02:05:39,719 --> 02:05:44,520
some what's that I said send me some

3010
02:05:43,039 --> 02:05:45,960
send you some you gonna save it for

3011
02:05:44,520 --> 02:05:49,559
decades though because I heard we got to

3012
02:05:45,960 --> 02:05:52,239
smoke it fast is what I heard from Sam I

3013
02:05:49,559 --> 02:05:54,880
can you got smoke it fast

3014
02:05:52,238 --> 02:05:57,078
I do I do love I love that interaction

3015
02:05:54,880 --> 02:06:00,880
though of watching you know Sam bring up

3016
02:05:57,078 --> 02:06:03,118
is it you know biologically relevant and

3017
02:06:00,880 --> 02:06:04,960
for you to say no it's just for fun

3018
02:06:03,118 --> 02:06:08,078
that's probably one of the Big Marketing

3019
02:06:04,960 --> 02:06:11,439
issues we've run into is that because we

3020
02:06:08,078 --> 02:06:14,319
had to Market this legally as a medical

3021
02:06:11,439 --> 02:06:16,399
product to create an infrastructure and

3022
02:06:14,319 --> 02:06:19,118
then we were marketing literal medical

3023
02:06:16,399 --> 02:06:20,879
products and America markets Medical

3024
02:06:19,118 --> 02:06:22,719
Products better than any country in the

3025
02:06:20,880 --> 02:06:25,760
world and by better I

3026
02:06:22,719 --> 02:06:29,559
mean you know with deception and

3027
02:06:25,760 --> 02:06:32,520
efficacy um but you know we haven't been

3028
02:06:29,559 --> 02:06:34,639
able to say this is important because we

3029
02:06:32,520 --> 02:06:36,159
like it this is important because it

3030
02:06:34,639 --> 02:06:39,400
tastes good this is important because

3031
02:06:36,158 --> 02:06:42,279
it's fun we've had to say this is

3032
02:06:39,399 --> 02:06:44,879
important for your mood for your

3033
02:06:42,279 --> 02:06:46,719
inflammation for your medical whatever

3034
02:06:44,880 --> 02:06:50,078
you know and so marketing has been

3035
02:06:46,719 --> 02:06:52,078
Twisted into this you know need to

3036
02:06:50,078 --> 02:06:54,359
impose a medical value

3037
02:06:52,078 --> 02:06:56,679
on a feature of the product rather than

3038
02:06:54,359 --> 02:06:56,679
just

3039
02:06:56,840 --> 02:07:05,480
embracing value mcy you you do

3040
02:07:01,399 --> 02:07:09,118
understand that when you combust or vape

3041
02:07:05,479 --> 02:07:11,198
uh flavonoids you do that you deactivate

3042
02:07:09,118 --> 02:07:12,839
them oh of course yeah if you want the

3043
02:07:11,198 --> 02:07:14,359
medical benefit we're we're talking

3044
02:07:12,840 --> 02:07:17,159
about food and that's where you know

3045
02:07:14,359 --> 02:07:18,920
that marketing gets completely lost to

3046
02:07:17,158 --> 02:07:21,039
the consumer because now consumers are

3047
02:07:18,920 --> 02:07:23,440
trying to eat gummies that have tpin

3048
02:07:21,039 --> 02:07:25,238
added that's going to do you know I

3049
02:07:23,439 --> 02:07:27,039
don't know what and they're not getting

3050
02:07:25,238 --> 02:07:29,839
a flavonoid count or any kind of

3051
02:07:27,039 --> 02:07:32,880
nutritional you know there's so many

3052
02:07:29,840 --> 02:07:36,039
valuable parts of that oil that we throw

3053
02:07:32,880 --> 02:07:36,039
away you

3054
02:07:38,039 --> 02:07:43,359
know yeah let me just mute that sorry

3055
02:07:41,319 --> 02:07:45,920
about the sorry yeah I just muted the

3056
02:07:43,359 --> 02:07:48,078
the mic um I did want to talk about

3057
02:07:45,920 --> 02:07:50,599
something that also feeds into exactly

3058
02:07:48,078 --> 02:07:52,198
what we're talking about here in the

3059
02:07:50,599 --> 02:07:54,480
sense of

3060
02:07:52,198 --> 02:07:57,238
you know extracting these aromatic

3061
02:07:54,479 --> 02:07:58,919
volatiles you know we love them we love

3062
02:07:57,238 --> 02:08:02,158
a lot of people love this High turpine

3063
02:07:58,920 --> 02:08:05,039
extract they love the flavor profiles at

3064
02:08:02,158 --> 02:08:08,558
what point in time because we know what

3065
02:08:05,039 --> 02:08:11,760
the capabilities of these compounds are

3066
02:08:08,559 --> 02:08:13,880
especially in Purity at what point will

3067
02:08:11,760 --> 02:08:15,719
we saturate and hit the number that is

3068
02:08:13,880 --> 02:08:19,159
like you know what this might not be

3069
02:08:15,719 --> 02:08:22,439
good to be um volz or vaporizing and

3070
02:08:19,158 --> 02:08:24,638
inhaling into our lungs I remember when

3071
02:08:22,439 --> 02:08:26,919
Tony started doing the TPS uh with Blue

3072
02:08:24,639 --> 02:08:30,319
River extracts and Blue River extracts

3073
02:08:26,920 --> 02:08:33,480
Canada we were doing you know TP dips

3074
02:08:30,319 --> 02:08:35,399
and just dipping our our full Mount

3075
02:08:33,479 --> 02:08:37,718
bubble right into like just like a jar

3076
02:08:35,399 --> 02:08:39,638
of like water clear I mean we were

3077
02:08:37,719 --> 02:08:41,760
calling them turpins I would suspect

3078
02:08:39,639 --> 02:08:44,599
they were probably should be named more

3079
02:08:41,760 --> 02:08:46,559
accurately aromatic volatile compounds

3080
02:08:44,599 --> 02:08:50,319
uh because I'm sure there were other you

3081
02:08:46,559 --> 02:08:51,960
know files and thiolates and Esters and

3082
02:08:50,319 --> 02:08:54,719
other things present other than just

3083
02:08:51,960 --> 02:08:57,319
tpin we just didn't have the capability

3084
02:08:54,719 --> 02:09:01,279
of perceiving them uh with analytical

3085
02:08:57,319 --> 02:09:04,238
equipment so um what how much is too

3086
02:09:01,279 --> 02:09:08,039
much I mean I think we've all pasted a

3087
02:09:04,238 --> 02:09:11,718
cart that was too much before and the

3088
02:09:08,039 --> 02:09:13,840
issue is that you know we've allowed the

3089
02:09:11,719 --> 02:09:16,520
agricultural nature of the plant and the

3090
02:09:13,840 --> 02:09:19,119
way that every Harvest can be different

3091
02:09:16,520 --> 02:09:21,159
to cross over into the lab there's not a

3092
02:09:19,118 --> 02:09:23,759
good excuse for every batch to be

3093
02:09:21,158 --> 02:09:27,039
different in the lab we can control a

3094
02:09:23,760 --> 02:09:29,480
lot um and the amount of flexibility

3095
02:09:27,039 --> 02:09:32,158
that we give the bat should be limited

3096
02:09:29,479 --> 02:09:34,598
to those flavors to those volatiles to

3097
02:09:32,158 --> 02:09:37,078
those things that are actually unique

3098
02:09:34,599 --> 02:09:38,800
and you know we see that very plainly

3099
02:09:37,078 --> 02:09:42,000
when we look at the label on flour

3100
02:09:38,800 --> 02:09:45,159
because you can have a room of 15

3101
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:48,118
different aromatic profiles and flavors

3102
02:09:45,158 --> 02:09:50,000
with one or two percentage points away

3103
02:09:48,118 --> 02:09:52,078
from each other in

3104
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:55,880
potency and

3105
02:09:52,078 --> 02:09:58,840
so you know to recognize that margin of

3106
02:09:55,880 --> 02:10:02,118
variance you know would require imposing

3107
02:09:58,840 --> 02:10:03,559
that in our manufactured products too

3108
02:10:02,118 --> 02:10:05,198
and so you know the fact that most

3109
02:10:03,559 --> 02:10:08,000
people don't even put the tpping content

3110
02:10:05,198 --> 02:10:09,799
on the label and then if they do do they

3111
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:11,639
have a standard for that you know is

3112
02:10:09,800 --> 02:10:16,000
someone because you can have flour at

3113
02:10:11,639 --> 02:10:18,359
1.8% turps and concentrate at 1.8% turps

3114
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:21,880
that's common that's for sale today and

3115
02:10:18,359 --> 02:10:24,799
that doesn't make any [ __ ] sense yeah

3116
02:10:21,880 --> 02:10:27,880
no for real Adam Adam and Marshall both

3117
02:10:24,800 --> 02:10:31,119
have their H uh hands up uh I think it

3118
02:10:27,880 --> 02:10:32,679
was Marshall first and then Adam so go

3119
02:10:31,118 --> 02:10:34,880
go ahead Marshall how do you put a hand

3120
02:10:32,679 --> 02:10:38,039
up I'm not very text saavy well are you

3121
02:10:34,880 --> 02:10:41,520
on a phone or a computer computer okay

3122
02:10:38,039 --> 02:10:44,039
so it's down I believe next to

3123
02:10:41,520 --> 02:10:46,599
react like next to share there's a

3124
02:10:44,039 --> 02:10:49,559
little heart oh the heart and it's a

3125
02:10:46,599 --> 02:10:51,679
drop down or pop up cool awesome thanks

3126
02:10:49,559 --> 02:10:54,239
guys I'm not I'm not too too good with

3127
02:10:51,679 --> 02:10:58,078
this [ __ ] well I will say before

3128
02:10:54,238 --> 02:10:59,678
Marshall goes and before uh Tony goes to

3129
02:10:58,078 --> 02:11:01,039
or not Tony I was saying Tony because

3130
02:10:59,679 --> 02:11:03,800
Tony's the guy that's in the room

3131
02:11:01,039 --> 02:11:06,078
chatting just said Nate yar's carts are

3132
02:11:03,800 --> 02:11:08,440
the best thing out there little uh

3133
02:11:06,078 --> 02:11:11,639
little little little props for you there

3134
02:11:08,439 --> 02:11:13,960
buddy so go ahead Marshall and then Adam

3135
02:11:11,639 --> 02:11:16,800
yeah on that topic of uh how much is too

3136
02:11:13,960 --> 02:11:19,039
much I think also the delivery method

3137
02:11:16,800 --> 02:11:21,599
can be pretty important and how hot you

3138
02:11:19,039 --> 02:11:24,399
get the oil and how it's being

3139
02:11:21,599 --> 02:11:26,599
volatilized off of the material uh so

3140
02:11:24,399 --> 02:11:28,679
for instance if you're dabbing uh with

3141
02:11:26,599 --> 02:11:31,159
any amount of tpin you can create

3142
02:11:28,679 --> 02:11:32,520
acryline and other reactive alahh tides

3143
02:11:31,158 --> 02:11:34,638
that can actually really damage your

3144
02:11:32,520 --> 02:11:37,040
lungs there's definitely medical case

3145
02:11:34,639 --> 02:11:38,679
studies out there people dying from this

3146
02:11:37,039 --> 02:11:40,880
from dabbing for a certain period of

3147
02:11:38,679 --> 02:11:42,279
time they're using a hot nail right so I

3148
02:11:40,880 --> 02:11:44,760
don't know how you guys do it I've

3149
02:11:42,279 --> 02:11:47,198
actually never done that just because it

3150
02:11:44,760 --> 02:11:49,039
just looks like smoking crack um my body

3151
02:11:47,198 --> 02:11:51,039
started doing that humble I'm like I

3152
02:11:49,039 --> 02:11:51,840
just roll a joint it's how I deal with

3153
02:11:51,039 --> 02:11:54,039
it

3154
02:11:51,840 --> 02:11:56,800
um but oh we must bring you to the dab

3155
02:11:54,039 --> 02:11:59,679
side my brethren bring you to the dab

3156
02:11:56,800 --> 02:12:01,800
I'm sure it will happen but uh I I make

3157
02:11:59,679 --> 02:12:03,480
a lot of oils uh where I'm working so

3158
02:12:01,800 --> 02:12:05,079
we've

3159
02:12:03,479 --> 02:12:08,638
TS

3160
02:12:05,078 --> 02:12:12,399
um as well I've I've uh dosed some of

3161
02:12:08,639 --> 02:12:13,679
the hemp tpin into or or oil I like to

3162
02:12:12,399 --> 02:12:15,078
call it as well because you're correct

3163
02:12:13,679 --> 02:12:18,000
there's all kinds of other compounds in

3164
02:12:15,078 --> 02:12:21,198
there besides der beans into beer and I

3165
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:23,198
overdosed myself one night uh kind of on

3166
02:12:21,198 --> 02:12:27,279
accident didn't have lab equipment to to

3167
02:12:23,198 --> 02:12:30,000
dilute it had a stainless steel um like

3168
02:12:27,279 --> 02:12:32,519
straw that I had in the in the kitchen

3169
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:34,479
dipped that in some oil put that into

3170
02:12:32,520 --> 02:12:36,639
some Ever Clear so I diluted it out into

3171
02:12:34,479 --> 02:12:39,558
some alcohol and then took one drop of

3172
02:12:36,639 --> 02:12:41,279
the Ever Clear into a beer and kind of

3173
02:12:39,559 --> 02:12:42,559
swirled around the can smelled it I

3174
02:12:41,279 --> 02:12:44,679
could smelled it smelled pretty good

3175
02:12:42,559 --> 02:12:46,719
took what Sip and it was it either came

3176
02:12:44,679 --> 02:12:49,039
back to the top of the beer and was

3177
02:12:46,719 --> 02:12:51,639
concentrated or it was just too much in

3178
02:12:49,039 --> 02:12:53,479
there um and I I did this kind for hop

3179
02:12:51,639 --> 02:12:55,520
companies making flavorings and things

3180
02:12:53,479 --> 02:12:58,638
for beers for years so I tried this

3181
02:12:55,520 --> 02:13:01,360
before but first time with him uh it it

3182
02:12:58,639 --> 02:13:03,760
was like a pretty strong stimulant it

3183
02:13:01,359 --> 02:13:06,319
for sure dropped my blood pressure

3184
02:13:03,760 --> 02:13:08,760
increased my heart rate and it was

3185
02:13:06,319 --> 02:13:10,439
intense for about an hour so anyway

3186
02:13:08,760 --> 02:13:12,920
that's where I I did overdo it in a

3187
02:13:10,439 --> 02:13:14,319
beverage uh just that one time when I

3188
02:13:12,920 --> 02:13:16,319
didn't have lab equipment to actually

3189
02:13:14,319 --> 02:13:19,198
get the dilution right and it was too

3190
02:13:16,319 --> 02:13:21,158
much um smoking wise though I've never

3191
02:13:19,198 --> 02:13:22,839
hit that I I definitely do a lot of

3192
02:13:21,158 --> 02:13:25,679
sensor and the oils we're making and I

3193
02:13:22,840 --> 02:13:27,039
can just smell these things all day you

3194
02:13:25,679 --> 02:13:29,520
definitely get high for about a half

3195
02:13:27,039 --> 02:13:32,840
hour as you're doing it and it goes away

3196
02:13:29,520 --> 02:13:34,000
um but uh they're they're also you know

3197
02:13:32,840 --> 02:13:36,000
like we're talking about with solvents

3198
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:37,679
right these are all solvents some of

3199
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:40,158
them are better for than others mirene

3200
02:13:37,679 --> 02:13:41,520
is definitely carcinogenic so one of the

3201
02:13:40,158 --> 02:13:43,638
major components in there especially if

3202
02:13:41,520 --> 02:13:46,159
you're doing a good job uh extracting it

3203
02:13:43,639 --> 02:13:48,359
it's got two terminal double bonds that

3204
02:13:46,158 --> 02:13:50,799
are reactive potentially and and can

3205
02:13:48,359 --> 02:13:53,558
cause problems so just keep that in mind

3206
02:13:50,800 --> 02:13:54,800
and think too much is where you know

3207
02:13:53,559 --> 02:13:56,920
you're just

3208
02:13:54,800 --> 02:13:59,079
overindulging you at the Lev of

3209
02:13:56,920 --> 02:14:01,880
concentration of the plant that's the

3210
02:13:59,078 --> 02:14:04,399
right amount you go beyond that it may

3211
02:14:01,880 --> 02:14:06,319
taste great it may smell good but it's

3212
02:14:04,399 --> 02:14:08,000
probably not great for you especially

3213
02:14:06,319 --> 02:14:10,238
when you're removing it from the plant

3214
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:12,158
Matrix that's how it was designed that's

3215
02:14:10,238 --> 02:14:14,678
how we evolved with it so that's how I

3216
02:14:12,158 --> 02:14:16,759
would consider it um and think about it

3217
02:14:14,679 --> 02:14:18,440
that way enjoy it if you want every once

3218
02:14:16,760 --> 02:14:21,520
in a while but I wouldn't go smoking

3219
02:14:18,439 --> 02:14:23,638
really high HD all the time

3220
02:14:21,520 --> 02:14:25,840
lead problems interesting perspective

3221
02:14:23,639 --> 02:14:30,599
for sure thanks Marshall go ahead Adam

3222
02:14:25,840 --> 02:14:32,078
and then hor after no I know that's uh

3223
02:14:30,599 --> 02:14:34,480
the feeling as well because I'm pretty

3224
02:14:32,078 --> 02:14:36,479
sensitive to tpin especially in a cart

3225
02:14:34,479 --> 02:14:39,198
super interesting though about like the

3226
02:14:36,479 --> 02:14:40,519
maybe the carts that I smoked were not

3227
02:14:39,198 --> 02:14:42,759
really vaporizing at the right

3228
02:14:40,520 --> 02:14:45,639
temperature but I was getting like just

3229
02:14:42,760 --> 02:14:47,960
really bad like kind of burning nose um

3230
02:14:45,639 --> 02:14:51,319
if it gets over probably about 5% TP

3231
02:14:47,960 --> 02:14:55,279
beans in a cart or like 5% like all

3232
02:14:51,319 --> 02:14:57,519
everything that's in the HTE really um

3233
02:14:55,279 --> 02:14:59,479
but really I think another kind of good

3234
02:14:57,520 --> 02:15:01,679
thing to bring up here is is that's good

3235
02:14:59,479 --> 02:15:03,598
opportunity for um some of the

3236
02:15:01,679 --> 02:15:05,679
crystallization processes as well where

3237
02:15:03,599 --> 02:15:07,840
you can separate I know Murphy you're

3238
02:15:05,679 --> 02:15:11,158
mentioning HTE but being able to

3239
02:15:07,840 --> 02:15:13,960
separate the HDA out from the from the

3240
02:15:11,158 --> 02:15:16,479
um THC then you can actually create like

3241
02:15:13,960 --> 02:15:18,840
a standardized product reformulating

3242
02:15:16,479 --> 02:15:20,678
those creating repeatable formulations

3243
02:15:18,840 --> 02:15:24,000
but I think the repeatability here is

3244
02:15:20,679 --> 02:15:25,880
like is a big factor as well as like um

3245
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:28,359
a lot of what has been brought up is

3246
02:15:25,880 --> 02:15:30,960
really just missing standards in the

3247
02:15:28,359 --> 02:15:34,279
industry um like if you look at the wine

3248
02:15:30,960 --> 02:15:38,039
industry um you're not allowed to call

3249
02:15:34,279 --> 02:15:39,519
uh something um you know uh champagne

3250
02:15:38,039 --> 02:15:41,920
unless it's from a certain region and

3251
02:15:39,520 --> 02:15:44,079
produced in a certain way and so that's

3252
02:15:41,920 --> 02:15:47,039
missing from our industry and so you end

3253
02:15:44,078 --> 02:15:50,439
up with um I know someone mentioned that

3254
02:15:47,039 --> 02:15:52,880
uh you know buying a live resin cart but

3255
02:15:50,439 --> 02:15:55,598
it's just like D9 from hemp mixed with

3256
02:15:52,880 --> 02:15:58,440
like some like tpin that they bought and

3257
02:15:55,599 --> 02:16:01,559
uh what's missing there is is really

3258
02:15:58,439 --> 02:16:03,359
like the the standards um not just for

3259
02:16:01,559 --> 02:16:04,599
marketing but also for like how it was

3260
02:16:03,359 --> 02:16:05,558
produced and then getting everybody on

3261
02:16:04,599 --> 02:16:07,960
the same

3262
02:16:05,559 --> 02:16:09,360
language I feel like that is an

3263
02:16:07,960 --> 02:16:11,279
interesting perspective that we've

3264
02:16:09,359 --> 02:16:13,598
covered many times here on hash church

3265
02:16:11,279 --> 02:16:16,279
and whenever I go back to thinking about

3266
02:16:13,599 --> 02:16:19,000
it I feel that and it really feeds right

3267
02:16:16,279 --> 02:16:21,118
into What marshall just said that the

3268
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:22,639
plant Matrix knows how to create the

3269
02:16:21,118 --> 02:16:25,399
safest way even though I've been chain

3270
02:16:22,639 --> 02:16:28,400
smoking concentrates for like 25 to 30

3271
02:16:25,399 --> 02:16:32,920
years uh hopefully I'll be okay I feel

3272
02:16:28,399 --> 02:16:34,199
pretty good um yeah it's uh what was I

3273
02:16:32,920 --> 02:16:37,599
gonna say I don't want to lose my train

3274
02:16:34,200 --> 02:16:40,359
of thought oh that we're not perceiving

3275
02:16:37,599 --> 02:16:42,599
everything that's present in a in a in a

3276
02:16:40,359 --> 02:16:45,760
cannabinoid and aromatic volatile

3277
02:16:42,599 --> 02:16:48,558
compound profile so those profiles have

3278
02:16:45,760 --> 02:16:51,159
a variety of things that never are

3279
02:16:48,558 --> 02:16:52,718
understood by us that we don't and this

3280
02:16:51,159 --> 02:16:54,920
is why I wanted to do this aromatic

3281
02:16:52,718 --> 02:16:56,318
profile show with with Nick zegler and

3282
02:16:54,920 --> 02:16:59,439
and Marshall and a bunch of others and

3283
02:16:56,318 --> 02:17:01,398
get these people his colleagues who who

3284
02:16:59,439 --> 02:17:03,719
designed this equipment that was able to

3285
02:17:01,398 --> 02:17:07,079
perceive these thols and thiolates at

3286
02:17:03,718 --> 02:17:10,959
such just unbelievably small uh

3287
02:17:07,079 --> 02:17:13,079
fractions so it's the my worry about

3288
02:17:10,959 --> 02:17:14,438
reformulation uh which I guess would

3289
02:17:13,079 --> 02:17:16,638
kind of echo a little bit about what

3290
02:17:14,439 --> 02:17:17,760
Marshall was just saying is that if

3291
02:17:16,638 --> 02:17:20,119
we're

3292
02:17:17,760 --> 02:17:22,599
missing too much of the picture and when

3293
02:17:20,120 --> 02:17:26,359
I say too much yes these compounds are

3294
02:17:22,599 --> 02:17:30,359
in way smaller um amounts but for anyone

3295
02:17:26,359 --> 02:17:32,239
that has ever had the exposure to THS uh

3296
02:17:30,359 --> 02:17:35,399
it they you don't need a lot like that

3297
02:17:32,239 --> 02:17:38,638
is that funk and that garlic and that it

3298
02:17:35,398 --> 02:17:40,039
it it's so strong that I I theorize I

3299
02:17:38,638 --> 02:17:41,398
don't think it's accurate I'm not a

3300
02:17:40,040 --> 02:17:43,080
chemist or anything but from the

3301
02:17:41,398 --> 02:17:45,920
conversations with Nick and Dr Mark and

3302
02:17:43,079 --> 02:17:49,000
different people that this giant tarpine

3303
02:17:45,920 --> 02:17:51,799
profile that we give all omage to is

3304
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:54,959
balanced precariously on a much smaller

3305
02:17:51,799 --> 02:17:58,318
delicate profile of smaller lesser

3306
02:17:54,959 --> 02:18:01,478
percentages that can shift that thing

3307
02:17:58,318 --> 02:18:05,079
from rotten baby diapers to strawberries

3308
02:18:01,478 --> 02:18:06,519
in a very very very small percent so

3309
02:18:05,079 --> 02:18:08,439
well we know that we know that because

3310
02:18:06,519 --> 02:18:10,359
you can buy off the-shelf turpins that

3311
02:18:08,439 --> 02:18:12,318
are like if you were going to test the

3312
02:18:10,359 --> 02:18:15,040
tpine profile of a plant it looks

3313
02:18:12,318 --> 02:18:17,599
exactly the same as the formula from off

3314
02:18:15,040 --> 02:18:19,160
the shelf kind of Botanicals right but

3315
02:18:17,599 --> 02:18:21,280
it when you taste it you know it's

3316
02:18:19,159 --> 02:18:23,638
completely different something missing

3317
02:18:21,280 --> 02:18:25,599
please jge uh it's uh you're up you've

3318
02:18:23,638 --> 02:18:27,959
had your hand up thank you by the way

3319
02:18:25,599 --> 02:18:30,398
Adam so I just want to share like my

3320
02:18:27,959 --> 02:18:33,919
experience on on like with these uh

3321
02:18:30,398 --> 02:18:36,439
topics I've uh played with CRC a lot and

3322
02:18:33,920 --> 02:18:40,239
then a lot of testing and also with

3323
02:18:36,439 --> 02:18:42,880
HTE so to start from the beginning like

3324
02:18:40,239 --> 02:18:45,679
back when they were saying uh CRC is

3325
02:18:42,879 --> 02:18:47,518
removing turps I I did a lot of testing

3326
02:18:45,679 --> 02:18:50,398
on that and found that actually the

3327
02:18:47,519 --> 02:18:52,840
turpins at least look the footprint

3328
02:18:50,398 --> 02:18:54,718
looked uh identical the uh to the amount

3329
02:18:52,840 --> 02:18:59,040
of tpin in there like nothing was being

3330
02:18:54,718 --> 02:19:01,318
offset or extra maybe a few 1% I mean

3331
02:18:59,040 --> 02:19:03,840
like points of uh percent of a

3332
02:19:01,318 --> 02:19:06,879
conversion say but the flavor was still

3333
02:19:03,840 --> 02:19:10,120
there essentially so when I looked into

3334
02:19:06,879 --> 02:19:12,959
it further I used the UV light and found

3335
02:19:10,120 --> 02:19:14,760
that the flavonoids which uh will glow

3336
02:19:12,959 --> 02:19:17,438
in that once they're absorbed into the

3337
02:19:14,760 --> 02:19:19,599
media the absorbance they were showing

3338
02:19:17,439 --> 02:19:21,159
up in the uh Medias and that what was

3339
02:19:19,599 --> 02:19:23,120
that's the flavor that was was being

3340
02:19:21,159 --> 02:19:26,599
pulled out that was associated with the

3341
02:19:23,120 --> 02:19:29,200
flavor LW say but when I looked into it

3342
02:19:26,599 --> 02:19:31,558
further it's like a that's where you say

3343
02:19:29,200 --> 02:19:33,599
how much is too much all those compounds

3344
02:19:31,558 --> 02:19:35,438
are a little bit heavier so they're

3345
02:19:33,599 --> 02:19:38,040
going to give you more of a harsher

3346
02:19:35,439 --> 02:19:41,280
taste to the extract so CRC is actually

3347
02:19:38,040 --> 02:19:42,200
balancing it and giving it like a more

3348
02:19:41,280 --> 02:19:45,079
better

3349
02:19:42,200 --> 02:19:46,840
profile and then you know people thought

3350
02:19:45,079 --> 02:19:49,478
like okay the red was more like it

3351
02:19:46,840 --> 02:19:51,159
needed more CRC to remove that color but

3352
02:19:49,478 --> 02:19:52,959
that red is like we already remove the

3353
02:19:51,159 --> 02:19:55,478
color with CRC that's the

3354
02:19:52,959 --> 02:19:57,279
chlorophyll uh and the other like

3355
02:19:55,478 --> 02:20:01,519
flavonoids you know the other pigments

3356
02:19:57,280 --> 02:20:04,079
so uh the red was more from like the

3357
02:20:01,520 --> 02:20:06,079
carotenoids which are just basically

3358
02:20:04,079 --> 02:20:08,600
like a hydrocarbon chains that that were

3359
02:20:06,079 --> 02:20:10,200
breaking down they were oxygen atoms

3360
02:20:08,600 --> 02:20:12,040
were attaching to it and making them

3361
02:20:10,200 --> 02:20:13,640
Santo so now they're looking red and

3362
02:20:12,040 --> 02:20:14,920
that's the red we're seeing so we were

3363
02:20:13,639 --> 02:20:18,000
never going to pull out that red with

3364
02:20:14,920 --> 02:20:20,799
more CRC so that's where people used too

3365
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:24,159
much of it and gave it a bad name but

3366
02:20:20,799 --> 02:20:27,199
but essentially once we went into uh

3367
02:20:24,159 --> 02:20:29,799
looking further into the HTE I started

3368
02:20:27,200 --> 02:20:32,479
looking into say the waxing theht and

3369
02:20:29,799 --> 02:20:34,759
that came from pushing it through a a

3370
02:20:32,478 --> 02:20:37,879
micron filter using

3371
02:20:34,760 --> 02:20:40,200
nitrogen and that would allow it to

3372
02:20:37,879 --> 02:20:41,318
basically dewax it and pull even more

3373
02:20:40,200 --> 02:20:43,720
heavier

3374
02:20:41,318 --> 02:20:46,760
compounds and started playing then with

3375
02:20:43,719 --> 02:20:48,959
like a making my own Vapes and found

3376
02:20:46,760 --> 02:20:51,079
that like I don't know if you guys dab

3377
02:20:48,959 --> 02:20:53,519
distill it before or just like pure

3378
02:20:51,079 --> 02:20:54,959
distillate or or diamonds but it doesn't

3379
02:20:53,520 --> 02:20:56,720
really just it doesn't give you that

3380
02:20:54,959 --> 02:20:58,719
full High you know it's like a little

3381
02:20:56,719 --> 02:21:01,920
bust that it gives you really

3382
02:20:58,719 --> 02:21:04,239
quick and I started noticing like okay

3383
02:21:01,920 --> 02:21:08,000
you don't really need that much D9 I

3384
02:21:04,239 --> 02:21:10,000
guess to get you that high where you're

3385
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:13,680
comfortable you're satisfied that comes

3386
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:16,719
more from going into

3387
02:21:13,680 --> 02:21:19,639
say when you go like to

3388
02:21:16,719 --> 02:21:22,079
a how do I say it like uh when you add

3389
02:21:19,639 --> 02:21:24,358
the other HTE components to it

3390
02:21:22,079 --> 02:21:28,079
so if

3391
02:21:24,359 --> 02:21:29,200
you add like a 90% cartridges which

3392
02:21:28,079 --> 02:21:31,318
unfortunately is what a lot of

3393
02:21:29,200 --> 02:21:33,600
dispensaries are going for they just

3394
02:21:31,318 --> 02:21:35,359
look at those numbers and if it's 90% or

3395
02:21:33,600 --> 02:21:37,880
higher that's what they're shopping for

3396
02:21:35,359 --> 02:21:39,399
to put on the shelves but in reality you

3397
02:21:37,879 --> 02:21:41,799
don't need that much because the flower

3398
02:21:39,398 --> 02:21:44,039
comes you know with very little and it

3399
02:21:41,799 --> 02:21:46,759
does the job so what that's telling me

3400
02:21:44,040 --> 02:21:49,840
is that you really just need about 40

3401
02:21:46,760 --> 02:21:53,760
50% say D9 in the cartridge and the rest

3402
02:21:49,840 --> 02:21:55,639
being HT and other stuff to uh basically

3403
02:21:53,760 --> 02:21:58,559
modify that high and give you that full

3404
02:21:55,639 --> 02:22:00,358
spectrum effect so just B basically

3405
02:21:58,559 --> 02:22:03,519
wanted to touch up on those things just

3406
02:22:00,359 --> 02:22:05,920
from my experiences that I tested I

3407
02:22:03,520 --> 02:22:08,239
agree with that sure I feel like the

3408
02:22:05,920 --> 02:22:09,879
more tping like that it does give you

3409
02:22:08,239 --> 02:22:13,559
the better effect and it's not about the

3410
02:22:09,879 --> 02:22:15,799
THC number and it is about the full

3411
02:22:13,559 --> 02:22:18,199
spectrum tpine effect with it the

3412
02:22:15,799 --> 02:22:19,799
Entourage effect that they call so I

3413
02:22:18,200 --> 02:22:22,200
totally agree with that I think we've

3414
02:22:19,799 --> 02:22:25,679
been able to lean on Full Spectrum

3415
02:22:22,200 --> 02:22:29,120
within the industry as like a catchall

3416
02:22:25,680 --> 02:22:30,398
because we also have these kind of you

3417
02:22:29,120 --> 02:22:33,280
know

3418
02:22:30,398 --> 02:22:36,119
intuitive we know what fire is because

3419
02:22:33,280 --> 02:22:39,120
we you know have seen the best and the

3420
02:22:36,120 --> 02:22:41,439
worst um you know just to shout out

3421
02:22:39,120 --> 02:22:44,000
abstracts I think you know to give us a

3422
02:22:41,439 --> 02:22:46,318
language that allows us to identify that

3423
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:48,799
category that we've been calling

3424
02:22:46,318 --> 02:22:51,039
TPS um you know which is probably more

3425
02:22:48,799 --> 02:22:53,239
appropriate than tpin because t is a

3426
02:22:51,040 --> 02:22:56,080
real thing and TPS can be a madeup one

3427
02:22:53,239 --> 02:22:58,879
you know put a z on it maybe um but you

3428
02:22:56,079 --> 02:23:01,000
know if we could just start categorizing

3429
02:22:58,879 --> 02:23:03,719
you know and like Marcus brought up to

3430
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:05,079
put the to put the number on there

3431
02:23:03,719 --> 02:23:09,398
wouldn't

3432
02:23:05,079 --> 02:23:12,398
necessarily communicate the influence of

3433
02:23:09,398 --> 02:23:14,398
that number but if we could even I

3434
02:23:12,398 --> 02:23:16,599
imagine just a pie chart of how much of

3435
02:23:14,398 --> 02:23:19,000
this is

3436
02:23:16,600 --> 02:23:21,520
volatile and you know so if we were to

3437
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:24,840
instead of saying hi turpine extract we

3438
02:23:21,520 --> 02:23:27,720
were to say extremely highly volatile

3439
02:23:24,840 --> 02:23:29,799
turpine extract versus medium volatile

3440
02:23:27,719 --> 02:23:32,438
extracts like are your turps popping the

3441
02:23:29,799 --> 02:23:35,759
lid every time you open them at room

3442
02:23:32,439 --> 02:23:38,079
temperature or do they not you know um

3443
02:23:35,760 --> 02:23:40,318
are these turps that are weighted by

3444
02:23:38,079 --> 02:23:44,600
oily flavorant because to add that

3445
02:23:40,318 --> 02:23:47,159
flavor category that isn't a volatile

3446
02:23:44,600 --> 02:23:49,840
aromatic is also really important

3447
02:23:47,159 --> 02:23:53,000
because like what I was just saying you

3448
02:23:49,840 --> 02:23:56,960
ask us for no color we can give you no

3449
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:58,799
color and if you ask us for no flavor

3450
02:23:56,959 --> 02:24:01,398
and no color we can give you that but if

3451
02:23:58,799 --> 02:24:03,478
you ask us for flavor and no color you

3452
02:24:01,398 --> 02:24:06,079
might be wrong about what you're asking

3453
02:24:03,478 --> 02:24:10,199
for because sometimes the flavor you

3454
02:24:06,079 --> 02:24:12,478
want has color you know and so to be

3455
02:24:10,200 --> 02:24:14,079
able to clarify what people are getting

3456
02:24:12,478 --> 02:24:16,639
out of it if we could give them a

3457
02:24:14,079 --> 02:24:17,920
representation of this this is a product

3458
02:24:16,639 --> 02:24:21,079
that

3459
02:24:17,920 --> 02:24:23,719
contains you know and agreed upon

3460
02:24:21,079 --> 02:24:25,398
we Define what's high you know because

3461
02:24:23,719 --> 02:24:27,920
no one's going to say this is a medium

3462
02:24:25,398 --> 02:24:30,519
level and no one's going to say low even

3463
02:24:27,920 --> 02:24:32,520
being able to say low THC you know is an

3464
02:24:30,520 --> 02:24:35,200
impressive achievement for the hemp

3465
02:24:32,520 --> 02:24:37,279
industry I think um because we've just

3466
02:24:35,200 --> 02:24:39,200
you know we've built ourselves up on

3467
02:24:37,279 --> 02:24:43,200
delivering high but if we could start

3468
02:24:39,200 --> 02:24:47,600
addressing it like volatile aromatic

3469
02:24:43,200 --> 02:24:49,760
flavor and then cannaboid potency as

3470
02:24:47,600 --> 02:24:52,079
extractors we could start really

3471
02:24:49,760 --> 02:24:53,520
innovating and our formulation could be

3472
02:24:52,079 --> 02:24:55,959
delivering for everybody it could be

3473
02:24:53,520 --> 02:24:58,760
delivering our own efficiency you know

3474
02:24:55,959 --> 02:25:01,639
like we started harvesting rooms for

3475
02:24:58,760 --> 02:25:04,200
extraction we started growing strains

3476
02:25:01,639 --> 02:25:07,079
for hash making now we could start

3477
02:25:04,200 --> 02:25:08,600
chasing resin for individual compounds

3478
02:25:07,079 --> 02:25:11,039
this [ __ ] could get better and better

3479
02:25:08,600 --> 02:25:12,640
and better um but we we do need the

3480
02:25:11,040 --> 02:25:14,120
language for what we're looking for

3481
02:25:12,639 --> 02:25:17,199
because we've been calling it some

3482
02:25:14,120 --> 02:25:20,399
pretty generic terms and I think we've

3483
02:25:17,200 --> 02:25:22,399
exhausted the turps no amount of mercine

3484
02:25:20,398 --> 02:25:24,760
is going to make a difference to me the

3485
02:25:22,398 --> 02:25:26,799
way a little bit of humulene does the

3486
02:25:24,760 --> 02:25:29,639
way a little bit of thle does the way

3487
02:25:26,799 --> 02:25:31,639
like those small numbers do and I think

3488
02:25:29,639 --> 02:25:33,599
there is a way for us to communicate

3489
02:25:31,639 --> 02:25:35,318
that to each other it does start with

3490
02:25:33,600 --> 02:25:37,840
the science we do need more people to

3491
02:25:35,318 --> 02:25:39,478
just add it up and it's tedious work and

3492
02:25:37,840 --> 02:25:42,760
investigating it and coming up with a

3493
02:25:39,478 --> 02:25:45,679
standard for it it's no good it's it's

3494
02:25:42,760 --> 02:25:47,398
it's effort you know um but that's

3495
02:25:45,680 --> 02:25:49,120
that's the work that on our end we have

3496
02:25:47,398 --> 02:25:51,079
to do and then when we get done with

3497
02:25:49,120 --> 02:25:53,000
that we can't stop we have to then

3498
02:25:51,079 --> 02:25:55,879
communicate it out to people in a way

3499
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:58,200
they can understand it so that it's not

3500
02:25:55,879 --> 02:26:00,199
you know so that if you tell me 2% th

3501
02:25:58,200 --> 02:26:01,920
I'm like oo spicy that doesn't mean

3502
02:26:00,200 --> 02:26:04,840
anything to anybody else we got to

3503
02:26:01,920 --> 02:26:08,799
figure out how that message gets all the

3504
02:26:04,840 --> 02:26:12,279
way absolutely horay had his hand up and

3505
02:26:08,799 --> 02:26:14,079
then Max you're right after him I had a

3506
02:26:12,279 --> 02:26:16,359
question for you guys one observation I

3507
02:26:14,079 --> 02:26:17,799
made like touching up on the color

3508
02:26:16,359 --> 02:26:19,079
because the color's there obviously

3509
02:26:17,799 --> 02:26:21,159
because the chlorophyll is there once to

3510
02:26:19,079 --> 02:26:23,799
remove it this oil canot oxidize quickly

3511
02:26:21,159 --> 02:26:25,639
if there's say no Turpin to protect it

3512
02:26:23,799 --> 02:26:29,358
but some like side observation I've seen

3513
02:26:25,639 --> 02:26:32,000
on that I've had HTE that wasn't fully

3514
02:26:29,359 --> 02:26:34,120
purged that sat for like say a year or

3515
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:36,279
two and it seems like the hydrocarbons

3516
02:26:34,120 --> 02:26:38,520
are protecting it from the oxygen

3517
02:26:36,279 --> 02:26:41,200
bonding to it and oxidizing it because

3518
02:26:38,520 --> 02:26:43,560
the color is and smell everything there

3519
02:26:41,200 --> 02:26:46,279
is just like when I extracted it you

3520
02:26:43,559 --> 02:26:48,039
know and it was just jars that were

3521
02:26:46,279 --> 02:26:49,159
sitting around waiting to get processed

3522
02:26:48,040 --> 02:26:51,720
you know and like I said they're for

3523
02:26:49,159 --> 02:26:53,359
sure like over a year old and it seems

3524
02:26:51,719 --> 02:26:56,000
like they were just fresh and I just

3525
02:26:53,359 --> 02:26:57,880
want to see if you guys have seen also a

3526
02:26:56,000 --> 02:27:00,040
similar

3527
02:26:57,879 --> 02:27:02,119
observation yeah that definitely can

3528
02:27:00,040 --> 02:27:03,720
happen I definitely feel like that that

3529
02:27:02,120 --> 02:27:06,359
is something that happens with it the

3530
02:27:03,719 --> 02:27:07,879
oxygen not being in there and it

3531
02:27:06,359 --> 02:27:09,600
preserves it for a long time if stuff

3532
02:27:07,879 --> 02:27:12,000
has sat around for like that and it's

3533
02:27:09,600 --> 02:27:14,880
already turke in the first place yeah

3534
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:17,079
some of the ogs on the uh in the group

3535
02:27:14,879 --> 02:27:19,000
could speak to this but in a lot of like

3536
02:27:17,079 --> 02:27:22,439
perfume Industries you have some of

3537
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:25,719
those um less odorous highly volatile

3538
02:27:22,439 --> 02:27:29,040
compounds in with your desirable odorous

3539
02:27:25,719 --> 02:27:31,398
volatile compound to help keep it in and

3540
02:27:29,040 --> 02:27:33,880
keep it from degrading and so the higher

3541
02:27:31,398 --> 02:27:35,519
volatility of it first of all kind of

3542
02:27:33,879 --> 02:27:37,920
like a nitrogen or an argon blank it

3543
02:27:35,520 --> 02:27:40,040
does it keeps the oxygen from getting in

3544
02:27:37,920 --> 02:27:43,120
um but it also because they repel water

3545
02:27:40,040 --> 02:27:45,800
it keeps water out um which reduces you

3546
02:27:43,120 --> 02:27:48,600
know additional reactions and um so a

3547
02:27:45,799 --> 02:27:50,759
lot of times you know like butane and

3548
02:27:48,600 --> 02:27:53,200
isobutane are preservatives sometimes in

3549
02:27:50,760 --> 02:27:55,800
aerosol products because they will just

3550
02:27:53,200 --> 02:27:58,720
keep everything from changing in there

3551
02:27:55,799 --> 02:28:02,000
it's it's a super effective system uh

3552
02:27:58,719 --> 02:28:05,639
that gets ignored by you know

3553
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:06,879
regulations um you know because we just

3554
02:28:05,639 --> 02:28:09,239
start to get a little bit of tunnel

3555
02:28:06,879 --> 02:28:11,239
vision but I've absolutely seen that and

3556
02:28:09,239 --> 02:28:13,199
it's it's common in other Industries you

3557
02:28:11,239 --> 02:28:14,719
know that's why we know that butane was

3558
02:28:13,200 --> 02:28:15,760
food safe in the first place is because

3559
02:28:14,719 --> 02:28:18,679
it's put

3560
02:28:15,760 --> 02:28:21,960
into like dairy products and stuff as a

3561
02:28:18,680 --> 02:28:26,639
you know as a preservative and prop

3562
02:28:21,959 --> 02:28:31,119
also in the perfume industry they use uh

3563
02:28:26,639 --> 02:28:35,879
fixant like uh Amber griffs from

3564
02:28:31,120 --> 02:28:35,880
Wales yeah true uh Max you're you're

3565
02:28:37,959 --> 02:28:43,239
up cool so I want to go back to what we

3566
02:28:41,559 --> 02:28:46,079
were talking about just a moment ago

3567
02:28:43,239 --> 02:28:48,279
what um Murphy was talking about the

3568
02:28:46,079 --> 02:28:50,359
like quantitative versus qualitative

3569
02:28:48,279 --> 02:28:53,399
components and how there's not necessar

3570
02:28:50,359 --> 02:28:55,600
a direct correlation and uh what I've

3571
02:28:53,398 --> 02:28:57,639
got anecdotally to share with you is is

3572
02:28:55,600 --> 02:28:59,200
a little cannabis adjacent but it's a

3573
02:28:57,639 --> 02:29:01,959
new discovery that I thought was really

3574
02:28:59,200 --> 02:29:04,279
fascinating for me um we're working on

3575
02:29:01,959 --> 02:29:05,799
some R&amp;D at medically correct some stuff

3576
02:29:04,279 --> 02:29:08,479
I don't really want to talk about too

3577
02:29:05,799 --> 02:29:11,079
much yet but it's for an edible product

3578
02:29:08,478 --> 02:29:13,438
that's going to ultimately be a cinnamon

3579
02:29:11,079 --> 02:29:15,600
thing that's got capsacin in it so we're

3580
02:29:13,439 --> 02:29:19,559
playing around with capsacin and we've

3581
02:29:15,600 --> 02:29:22,120
got some pure capsacin isolate and uh

3582
02:29:19,559 --> 02:29:24,799
wow has really increased my respect for

3583
02:29:22,120 --> 02:29:27,880
what nature can produce and just

3584
02:29:24,799 --> 02:29:29,239
synthesize through a plant and um and

3585
02:29:27,879 --> 02:29:31,519
the reason I'm bringing it up is because

3586
02:29:29,239 --> 02:29:34,279
we were playing around with how much do

3587
02:29:31,520 --> 02:29:36,920
we put in here what is going to be like

3588
02:29:34,279 --> 02:29:39,439
uh palatable we want it to be fun not

3589
02:29:36,920 --> 02:29:42,359
too subtle but not too much and through

3590
02:29:39,439 --> 02:29:45,079
the R&amp;D where we landed at is the amount

3591
02:29:42,359 --> 02:29:50,640
of capsacin that is going into like a

3592
02:29:45,079 --> 02:29:52,600
single serving is 31 100,000 of a grand

3593
02:29:50,639 --> 02:29:55,398
and it's like really impressive how

3594
02:29:52,600 --> 02:29:57,279
spicy it is I like like spicy food and

3595
02:29:55,398 --> 02:29:59,879
wanted to push it a little bit more and

3596
02:29:57,279 --> 02:30:01,560
we did some internal R&amp;D within the

3597
02:29:59,879 --> 02:30:03,398
company and was just getting feedback

3598
02:30:01,559 --> 02:30:07,039
from people and I'm telling you at

3599
02:30:03,398 --> 02:30:09,519
three1 100,000s of a gram some people

3600
02:30:07,040 --> 02:30:12,720
were like this is maybe a little too

3601
02:30:09,520 --> 02:30:14,239
much and so you know just going back to

3602
02:30:12,719 --> 02:30:16,199
people who want to look at a potency

3603
02:30:14,239 --> 02:30:18,680
test and what do the numbers say and

3604
02:30:16,200 --> 02:30:21,159
what tpine is this and that and you know

3605
02:30:18,680 --> 02:30:24,439
the the difference between quantitative

3606
02:30:21,159 --> 02:30:27,398
and qualitative value is not a direct

3607
02:30:24,439 --> 02:30:29,840
correlation and so I just felt like that

3608
02:30:27,398 --> 02:30:32,119
was one where you just got immediate

3609
02:30:29,840 --> 02:30:34,760
feedback because the capsacin is so in

3610
02:30:32,120 --> 02:30:37,880
your face it's just such a Nots subtle

3611
02:30:34,760 --> 02:30:40,359
thing that that was uh just a recent

3612
02:30:37,879 --> 02:30:43,639
Revelation I had that's got for me

3613
02:30:40,359 --> 02:30:46,200
respecting peppers and just the Earth so

3614
02:30:43,639 --> 02:30:48,159
much more than I did before and uh so I

3615
02:30:46,200 --> 02:30:50,680
just wanted to throw that out there as

3616
02:30:48,159 --> 02:30:53,680
Food For Thought hey I think that's

3617
02:30:50,680 --> 02:30:55,880
really valid the Scoville uh you know

3618
02:30:53,680 --> 02:30:57,398
range was you know came up with for that

3619
02:30:55,879 --> 02:31:00,119
exact reason because you can't

3620
02:30:57,398 --> 02:31:01,719
communicate those tiny decimals the way

3621
02:31:00,120 --> 02:31:02,960
that pictures of a number of spicy

3622
02:31:01,719 --> 02:31:07,278
peppers

3623
02:31:02,959 --> 02:31:12,239
does right at my Factory in Kansas we

3624
02:31:07,279 --> 02:31:15,960
once extracted 2,000 pounds of fiery red

3625
02:31:12,239 --> 02:31:20,159
peppers and It produced about 25 gallons

3626
02:31:15,959 --> 02:31:23,478
of this incredibly red oil but when we

3627
02:31:20,159 --> 02:31:26,398
opened the Chamber up to have a look at

3628
02:31:23,478 --> 02:31:29,358
it all of a sudden we could not take a

3629
02:31:26,398 --> 02:31:32,278
breath in or out our our breath was

3630
02:31:29,359 --> 02:31:35,200
frozen we ran out the door opened the

3631
02:31:32,279 --> 02:31:37,640
door and ran out we're outside drooling

3632
02:31:35,200 --> 02:31:40,240
and spitting and while we were out there

3633
02:31:37,639 --> 02:31:41,639
two mice ran out of the building as fast

3634
02:31:40,239 --> 02:31:45,600
as we

3635
02:31:41,639 --> 02:31:49,478
did it turns out it was a great Mouse uh

3636
02:31:45,600 --> 02:31:51,479
remover but yeah that stuff is scary and

3637
02:31:49,478 --> 02:31:53,719
we had go through quite a process to get

3638
02:31:51,478 --> 02:31:56,438
it out of the chamber and pack it up and

3639
02:31:53,719 --> 02:31:59,599
send it off to the people who wanted it

3640
02:31:56,439 --> 02:32:03,880
but very very dangerous stuff uh and by

3641
02:31:59,600 --> 02:32:07,520
the way we only use uh analytical grade

3642
02:32:03,879 --> 02:32:07,519
ISO butane for all our

3643
02:32:08,600 --> 02:32:13,640
extractions just my prob good probably a

3644
02:32:11,200 --> 02:32:17,359
good idea thanks for sharing John also

3645
02:32:13,639 --> 02:32:20,639
too the vanilloid receptor and the

3646
02:32:17,359 --> 02:32:22,920
caspen receptor interplays with the CB1

3647
02:32:20,639 --> 02:32:22,920
and the

3648
02:32:23,879 --> 02:32:29,559
CB2 interesting just a little drop of

3649
02:32:26,680 --> 02:32:32,639
knowledge there very very interesting uh

3650
02:32:29,559 --> 02:32:35,398
I did want to welcome JM to the room and

3651
02:32:32,639 --> 02:32:37,039
etan etan obviously we heard from

3652
02:32:35,398 --> 02:32:39,959
already so it's always good to have him

3653
02:32:37,040 --> 02:32:42,479
he's a regular panelist in the room but

3654
02:32:39,959 --> 02:32:45,398
uh are you still around JM or did you

3655
02:32:42,478 --> 02:32:47,278
turn your phone off and oh there you are

3656
02:32:45,398 --> 02:32:49,199
just got to unmute yourself there you go

3657
02:32:47,279 --> 02:32:51,840
unmute yeah I'm still here what's up

3658
02:32:49,200 --> 02:32:55,240
guys I'm used to listening to has church

3659
02:32:51,840 --> 02:32:57,000
and uh not chiming in so I'm trying to

3660
02:32:55,239 --> 02:33:00,000
break the ice here thank you Marcus for

3661
02:32:57,000 --> 02:33:02,520
doing that for me um it's an interesting

3662
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:04,959
conversation regarding you know the

3663
02:33:02,520 --> 02:33:09,079
total flavor we experience when we smoke

3664
02:33:04,959 --> 02:33:12,879
hash or you know dab hash St it and

3665
02:33:09,079 --> 02:33:13,920
Turpin how much is too much um and then

3666
02:33:12,879 --> 02:33:17,119
also

3667
02:33:13,920 --> 02:33:20,120
flavonoid and I've been of the mind that

3668
02:33:17,120 --> 02:33:23,000
the flavonoids as we ingest them in a

3669
02:33:20,120 --> 02:33:26,319
vapor are not really contributing to

3670
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:28,559
flavor um I played around with you know

3671
02:33:26,318 --> 02:33:30,760
Wasing the media and trying to add that

3672
02:33:28,559 --> 02:33:33,719
back at minute amounts and it didn't

3673
02:33:30,760 --> 02:33:37,478
seem to help much it actually was

3674
02:33:33,719 --> 02:33:40,358
horrible but um I wonder if you look at

3675
02:33:37,478 --> 02:33:42,358
Citrus oils or just a lot of essential

3676
02:33:40,359 --> 02:33:45,520
oils that are you know refined for

3677
02:33:42,359 --> 02:33:47,600
flavoring is uh you know they will do

3678
02:33:45,520 --> 02:33:50,000
what they call folding you know you'll

3679
02:33:47,600 --> 02:33:54,120
see like a orange essential oil that'll

3680
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:56,040
say fivefold or you know tfold and what

3681
02:33:54,120 --> 02:33:59,200
they're doing there is

3682
02:33:56,040 --> 02:34:02,800
actually um removing or reducing the

3683
02:33:59,200 --> 02:34:04,680
amount of actual tpes to increase the

3684
02:34:02,799 --> 02:34:07,079
ratio of

3685
02:34:04,680 --> 02:34:10,398
terpenoids um which I'm pretty sure are

3686
02:34:07,079 --> 02:34:12,478
generally a little more um volatile but

3687
02:34:10,398 --> 02:34:16,318
you know contain more of that

3688
02:34:12,478 --> 02:34:19,840
quintessential flavor of say a uh blood

3689
02:34:16,318 --> 02:34:21,318
orange versus a mandrian orange and I

3690
02:34:19,840 --> 02:34:24,439
wonder Murphy when you talk about

3691
02:34:21,318 --> 02:34:27,799
fractionating your HTE is are you

3692
02:34:24,439 --> 02:34:32,000
running that through a column um to kind

3693
02:34:27,799 --> 02:34:32,000
of split the different classes

3694
02:34:32,318 --> 02:34:39,239
or yeah I'm just copying uh you know

3695
02:34:36,200 --> 02:34:41,760
what any other analytical instrument

3696
02:34:39,239 --> 02:34:45,039
would be doing and so I'll just run

3697
02:34:41,760 --> 02:34:46,960
through um either a silica and T5 so

3698
02:34:45,040 --> 02:34:50,319
that I can get high pressure high

3699
02:34:46,959 --> 02:34:54,318
resistance or through alumina if I just

3700
02:34:50,318 --> 02:34:56,639
want um you know minimal separation and

3701
02:34:54,318 --> 02:34:59,159
I want it to go faster so the media is

3702
02:34:56,639 --> 02:35:01,119
doing a you know really inert job of

3703
02:34:59,159 --> 02:35:04,159
just being a stationary phase and then

3704
02:35:01,120 --> 02:35:06,520
just high pressure controlling the

3705
02:35:04,159 --> 02:35:10,119
temperature again just copying what you

3706
02:35:06,520 --> 02:35:13,680
know an hlc uh GC would do so that I can

3707
02:35:10,120 --> 02:35:15,240
then elute things based on you know and

3708
02:35:13,680 --> 02:35:16,880
what I do is again I I always call it

3709
02:35:15,239 --> 02:35:18,478
fractioning because I don't have to know

3710
02:35:16,879 --> 02:35:20,478
when it's going to come out I just have

3711
02:35:18,478 --> 02:35:23,599
to have a lot of jars you know a lot of

3712
02:35:20,478 --> 02:35:25,079
containers ready to go no big deal um

3713
02:35:23,600 --> 02:35:27,279
and I've got you know a falling film so

3714
02:35:25,079 --> 02:35:29,920
it's pretty continuous but then I'm just

3715
02:35:27,279 --> 02:35:32,040
collecting things as they come and if

3716
02:35:29,920 --> 02:35:34,159
they come overlapping I can do it again

3717
02:35:32,040 --> 02:35:35,520
make it longer make it slower but just

3718
02:35:34,159 --> 02:35:38,719
by controlling that pressure and feed

3719
02:35:35,520 --> 02:35:40,960
rate and so what I get is different jars

3720
02:35:38,719 --> 02:35:43,119
that sometimes need to be combined and

3721
02:35:40,959 --> 02:35:45,719
sometimes need to be

3722
02:35:43,120 --> 02:35:47,680
reprocessed right on yeah that's uh what

3723
02:35:45,719 --> 02:35:49,959
caught my eye and ear years ago when you

3724
02:35:47,680 --> 02:35:52,520
started doing that ban based

3725
02:35:49,959 --> 02:35:54,799
chromatography are you I'm sure you've

3726
02:35:52,520 --> 02:35:57,720
sent all your jws to the

3727
02:35:54,799 --> 02:35:59,679
lab yeah most of them can't be tested

3728
02:35:57,719 --> 02:36:01,358
though like I want to test for waxes

3729
02:35:59,680 --> 02:36:03,600
right so you brought up you know what's

3730
02:36:01,359 --> 02:36:05,399
the value in the flavonoids that's a

3731
02:36:03,600 --> 02:36:08,680
perfect point is can of Flavin

3732
02:36:05,398 --> 02:36:12,318
contributes a lot to a texture and a

3733
02:36:08,680 --> 02:36:14,720
viscosity and a color in your oil and

3734
02:36:12,318 --> 02:36:17,559
whether or not it has a a medical

3735
02:36:14,719 --> 02:36:18,760
benefit when you smoke it and at what

3736
02:36:17,559 --> 02:36:20,680
level it's got you know a

3737
02:36:18,760 --> 02:36:22,920
bioavailability when you eat it those

3738
02:36:20,680 --> 02:36:24,880
are a lot of you know very complicated

3739
02:36:22,920 --> 02:36:28,318
questions but if I want to communicate

3740
02:36:24,879 --> 02:36:30,398
to a consumer Why this color yellow is

3741
02:36:28,318 --> 02:36:36,239
okay and this

3742
02:36:30,398 --> 02:36:39,239
one isn't I want to have a thing to say

3743
02:36:36,239 --> 02:36:41,000
that counts and so in fractioning what I

3744
02:36:39,239 --> 02:36:44,920
have is a bunch of

3745
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:47,879
jars and many of them I can't say what

3746
02:36:44,920 --> 02:36:51,359
they are lots of them smell horrible

3747
02:36:47,879 --> 02:36:55,358
some of them ferment rapidly I got jars

3748
02:36:51,359 --> 02:36:57,359
of weird [ __ ] it's not helpful you know

3749
02:36:55,359 --> 02:36:59,880
and and so what I do is I keep them and

3750
02:36:57,359 --> 02:37:02,760
so when I'm reformulating what I'm

3751
02:36:59,879 --> 02:37:06,719
actually doing is just removing

3752
02:37:02,760 --> 02:37:08,239
Things based on my own bias and the the

3753
02:37:06,719 --> 02:37:11,760
few things I can

3754
02:37:08,239 --> 02:37:14,559
quantify and those things are the safest

3755
02:37:11,760 --> 02:37:18,000
parts of the oil you know I can quantify

3756
02:37:14,559 --> 02:37:21,318
TC the only part that won't kill me heyn

3757
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:23,398
what makes it difficult John can you can

3758
02:37:21,318 --> 02:37:26,478
you introduce yourself because the panel

3759
02:37:23,398 --> 02:37:30,039
hasn't met you yet and then we have some

3760
02:37:26,478 --> 02:37:32,000
we have some hands up um we have let me

3761
02:37:30,040 --> 02:37:34,040
just figure this out real quick yeah it

3762
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:37,398
was Marshall again who would be first

3763
02:37:34,040 --> 02:37:40,359
after you introduce yourself and then uh

3764
02:37:37,398 --> 02:37:41,959
Yari uh has his hand up as well so go

3765
02:37:40,359 --> 02:37:45,079
ahead and introduce

3766
02:37:41,959 --> 02:37:49,599
yourself yeah long time listener first

3767
02:37:45,079 --> 02:37:52,639
time caller here um true story

3768
02:37:49,600 --> 02:37:55,720
for real I started sci-fi systems uh

3769
02:37:52,639 --> 02:37:58,039
gosh what 2016 or so I come out of the

3770
02:37:55,719 --> 02:37:59,959
broader natural product space um you

3771
02:37:58,040 --> 02:38:02,080
know working with isolating compounds

3772
02:37:59,959 --> 02:38:04,519
for the biomedical you know drug

3773
02:38:02,079 --> 02:38:07,840
Discovery Market but uh I've always

3774
02:38:04,520 --> 02:38:10,640
loved cannabis and I quickly found that

3775
02:38:07,840 --> 02:38:13,200
the Cannabis industry was a real chill

3776
02:38:10,639 --> 02:38:16,799
industry compared to dealing with uh you

3777
02:38:13,200 --> 02:38:20,240
know the more academic uh side of things

3778
02:38:16,799 --> 02:38:22,239
and you know that was uh really what

3779
02:38:20,239 --> 02:38:25,039
made me switch completely to start

3780
02:38:22,239 --> 02:38:26,879
sci-fi also at the time I had a lot of

3781
02:38:25,040 --> 02:38:29,160
business relationships with equipment

3782
02:38:26,879 --> 02:38:31,239
manufacturers you guys will remember

3783
02:38:29,159 --> 02:38:34,600
when uh some of these folks wouldn't

3784
02:38:31,239 --> 02:38:36,959
even you know associate with cannabis so

3785
02:38:34,600 --> 02:38:40,200
um it was a prime time back then to

3786
02:38:36,959 --> 02:38:43,559
bring those two worlds together and uh

3787
02:38:40,200 --> 02:38:47,079
since I'm just loving it it's a much

3788
02:38:43,559 --> 02:38:49,959
cooler more casual industry um and the

3789
02:38:47,079 --> 02:38:51,318
questions and unknowns are gosh this

3790
02:38:49,959 --> 02:38:54,398
plant is

3791
02:38:51,318 --> 02:38:56,318
so uh there's a lot to it we take for

3792
02:38:54,398 --> 02:38:59,799
granted that we just put utane in a tube

3793
02:38:56,318 --> 02:39:01,439
and get oil but there is a lot to it

3794
02:38:59,799 --> 02:39:03,159
especially as far as what we're talking

3795
02:39:01,439 --> 02:39:05,639
about here safety and all that so yeah

3796
02:39:03,159 --> 02:39:07,799
that's me awesome well welcome and we're

3797
02:39:05,639 --> 02:39:08,760
happy to have you here and Marshall

3798
02:39:07,799 --> 02:39:11,879
you're

3799
02:39:08,760 --> 02:39:14,719
up yeah just uh briefly on flavonoids

3800
02:39:11,879 --> 02:39:17,000
the T the ner the name comes from a

3801
02:39:14,719 --> 02:39:19,559
flavor from your tongue it's a bittering

3802
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:22,200
component like the polyphenols so the

3803
02:39:19,559 --> 02:39:25,318
flavonoids are biochemically sort of the

3804
02:39:22,200 --> 02:39:28,120
is in between of the aromatic compounds

3805
02:39:25,318 --> 02:39:30,639
the tpes and the turpenoid formation and

3806
02:39:28,120 --> 02:39:32,479
the polyphenol formation so the

3807
02:39:30,639 --> 02:39:34,239
polyphenols are the water soluble bitter

3808
02:39:32,478 --> 02:39:36,318
components right and then the flavonoids

3809
02:39:34,239 --> 02:39:39,840
are kind of in this you know gray area

3810
02:39:36,318 --> 02:39:42,318
in between um when it comes to

3811
02:39:39,840 --> 02:39:43,840
analysis uh there's methods out there

3812
02:39:42,318 --> 02:39:45,398
it's a matter of having access to the

3813
02:39:43,840 --> 02:39:47,600
equipment if you guys want to start

3814
02:39:45,398 --> 02:39:50,000
doing analysis on flavonoids that's not

3815
02:39:47,600 --> 02:39:51,960
a problem we can make it happen um it's

3816
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:54,120
just a matter of finding the equipment

3817
02:39:51,959 --> 02:39:56,639
uh I've also been picking up old

3818
02:39:54,120 --> 02:39:57,920
analytical equipment on auction sites so

3819
02:39:56,639 --> 02:39:59,599
hopefully one of these days I'll have

3820
02:39:57,920 --> 02:40:01,359
all these capabilities in my house it's

3821
02:39:59,600 --> 02:40:03,279
a matter again it costs a lot of money

3822
02:40:01,359 --> 02:40:05,559
even just to run them right it's like

3823
02:40:03,279 --> 02:40:08,120
$20,000 just to get the power hooked up

3824
02:40:05,559 --> 02:40:10,278
to my house to to uh to put one of these

3825
02:40:08,120 --> 02:40:12,800
instruments in even if it didn't cost me

3826
02:40:10,279 --> 02:40:14,000
half million dollars to buy outright so

3827
02:40:12,799 --> 02:40:15,559
anyway I'm working on those sorts of

3828
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:17,559
things CU I'm a curious person that's

3829
02:40:15,559 --> 02:40:20,079
how I ended up here I love sensor I love

3830
02:40:17,559 --> 02:40:22,559
the effects and then I'm a reductionist

3831
02:40:20,079 --> 02:40:24,398
chemist in that way and so yeah we can

3832
02:40:22,559 --> 02:40:25,719
we can make that happen just a matter of

3833
02:40:24,398 --> 02:40:28,318
you know finding the equipment it is

3834
02:40:25,719 --> 02:40:30,278
expensive that's part of the problem

3835
02:40:28,318 --> 02:40:32,119
right is that it takes who cares about

3836
02:40:30,279 --> 02:40:34,200
it and then it takes the money to invest

3837
02:40:32,120 --> 02:40:36,319
in it um but there's equipment out there

3838
02:40:34,200 --> 02:40:38,079
I know you know I know a bunch of

3839
02:40:36,318 --> 02:40:40,639
professors at universities that less use

3840
02:40:38,079 --> 02:40:43,359
their their equipment if if it was a

3841
02:40:40,639 --> 02:40:45,478
good project well and and don't discount

3842
02:40:43,359 --> 02:40:48,079
the time a lot of analytical chemists

3843
02:40:45,478 --> 02:40:51,079
don't realize that everyone else doesn't

3844
02:40:48,079 --> 02:40:53,159
know that for you to turn it on and

3845
02:40:51,079 --> 02:40:56,799
calibrate it to get a baseline before

3846
02:40:53,159 --> 02:40:58,959
you can start testing a standard if you

3847
02:40:56,799 --> 02:41:01,959
already have a method and a standard

3848
02:40:58,959 --> 02:41:04,559
you're putting just days of effort you

3849
02:41:01,959 --> 02:41:06,799
know into some of this equipment and so

3850
02:41:04,559 --> 02:41:09,680
you know to give you one sample and say

3851
02:41:06,799 --> 02:41:12,679
tell me what's in it that could be three

3852
02:41:09,680 --> 02:41:14,600
months of work and calibration and

3853
02:41:12,680 --> 02:41:16,520
rerunning and development and Sample

3854
02:41:14,600 --> 02:41:19,559
prep and and then it doesn't always

3855
02:41:16,520 --> 02:41:21,279
translate directly over to that product

3856
02:41:19,559 --> 02:41:23,879
infused into something else it's a

3857
02:41:21,279 --> 02:41:25,479
tremendous amount of time that someone

3858
02:41:23,879 --> 02:41:27,119
has to investigate I started buying

3859
02:41:25,478 --> 02:41:30,079
analytical equipment and quickly learned

3860
02:41:27,120 --> 02:41:33,600
I don't have the patience to run a

3861
02:41:30,079 --> 02:41:35,520
GC right Yari you got your hand up yeah

3862
02:41:33,600 --> 02:41:37,760
Murphy I had a question for you how come

3863
02:41:35,520 --> 02:41:40,960
you run your HTE and fractionate it

3864
02:41:37,760 --> 02:41:42,600
through T5 which will muddle instead of

3865
02:41:40,959 --> 02:41:47,278
leaving it as it is when it comes off

3866
02:41:42,600 --> 02:41:50,200
the extract so I'll use T5 as um a

3867
02:41:47,279 --> 02:41:52,079
dehydrating process so if I'm just going

3868
02:41:50,200 --> 02:41:54,920
to fraction HTE if I have something

3869
02:41:52,079 --> 02:41:57,079
that's already liquid and I've got phca

3870
02:41:54,920 --> 02:42:00,120
out of the mix then that'll just go

3871
02:41:57,079 --> 02:42:01,879
through alumina um T5 just allows me to

3872
02:42:00,120 --> 02:42:03,800
go at much higher pressure because

3873
02:42:01,879 --> 02:42:05,478
otherwise I would have to go through a

3874
02:42:03,799 --> 02:42:08,840
super long

3875
02:42:05,478 --> 02:42:10,719
column which would just I don't want to

3876
02:42:08,840 --> 02:42:12,880
and so you know I get a ton of

3877
02:42:10,719 --> 02:42:15,559
resistance out of that T5 and it's just

3878
02:42:12,879 --> 02:42:18,639
blended with the silica and so it's just

3879
02:42:15,559 --> 02:42:22,439
there to slow everything down really is

3880
02:42:18,639 --> 02:42:25,278
T5 media it is it's a benite clay that's

3881
02:42:22,439 --> 02:42:27,639
um acidified

3882
02:42:25,279 --> 02:42:30,279
essentially um so that it's going to be

3883
02:42:27,639 --> 02:42:33,559
a little bit more similar to silica gel

3884
02:42:30,279 --> 02:42:36,359
in that pH and so it's um it can hold a

3885
02:42:33,559 --> 02:42:39,199
lot of water specifically and it's a

3886
02:42:36,359 --> 02:42:41,479
very fine powder um it's probably finer

3887
02:42:39,200 --> 02:42:43,760
particle size than the silica gel but

3888
02:42:41,478 --> 02:42:46,478
the silica gel is really doing the the

3889
02:42:43,760 --> 02:42:49,200
chromatography lifting and so with that

3890
02:42:46,478 --> 02:42:51,920
process what I'll be able to do is get

3891
02:42:49,200 --> 02:42:53,880
easy stuff out at high pressure and then

3892
02:42:51,920 --> 02:42:56,120
I have to heat it up and get the

3893
02:42:53,879 --> 02:42:59,478
everything else out and then that

3894
02:42:56,120 --> 02:43:02,359
everything else can get refiltered if we

3895
02:42:59,478 --> 02:43:04,959
want and if I skip that part then you

3896
02:43:02,359 --> 02:43:07,318
get a bunch of the water soluble water

3897
02:43:04,959 --> 02:43:11,039
missible water

3898
02:43:07,318 --> 02:43:12,478
adjacent stuff um and so you know T5

3899
02:43:11,040 --> 02:43:14,160
will help hold on to that and there will

3900
02:43:12,478 --> 02:43:16,478
be there'll be Turpin other things in

3901
02:43:14,159 --> 02:43:19,200
there that you can still fraction off

3902
02:43:16,478 --> 02:43:21,239
again it's just um sort of I always call

3903
02:43:19,200 --> 02:43:24,040
sorting my laundry just give me what's

3904
02:43:21,239 --> 02:43:26,398
easy and then I'll have you know an

3905
02:43:24,040 --> 02:43:28,359
accumulation of jars that are for later

3906
02:43:26,398 --> 02:43:32,439
that will come back to because I no

3907
02:43:28,359 --> 02:43:34,318
cannaboids left behind but um you know

3908
02:43:32,439 --> 02:43:38,000
but why do all that work to formulate

3909
02:43:34,318 --> 02:43:40,478
them back together again oh that work is

3910
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:42,959
absolutely a function of getting shitty

3911
02:43:40,478 --> 02:43:45,719
weed and having to make the best product

3912
02:43:42,959 --> 02:43:48,199
you can from it if the weed is [ __ ]

3913
02:43:45,719 --> 02:43:50,719
old and gross see I'm sorry you can oh

3914
02:43:48,200 --> 02:43:53,439
your weed's all good the the living soil

3915
02:43:50,719 --> 02:43:55,438
guy the living soil guy is like what the

3916
02:43:53,439 --> 02:43:58,359
[ __ ] like what what could you

3917
02:43:55,439 --> 02:44:01,880
possibly no

3918
02:43:58,359 --> 02:44:04,000
man that's if that's why then okay L I

3919
02:44:01,879 --> 02:44:06,478
even loved your sound of

3920
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:09,120
disappointment you get those degradation

3921
02:44:06,478 --> 02:44:11,039
components you know when you go from

3922
02:44:09,120 --> 02:44:15,000
like the wax that's the cuticle of the

3923
02:44:11,040 --> 02:44:17,520
turpine to like these degrad fatty acidy

3924
02:44:15,000 --> 02:44:20,079
oil things that are like I said

3925
02:44:17,520 --> 02:44:22,359
sometimes it's like truly for menting in

3926
02:44:20,079 --> 02:44:24,120
those final jars and so I'm going to get

3927
02:44:22,359 --> 02:44:26,239
I'm going to skim the

3928
02:44:24,120 --> 02:44:30,160
cream and then I'm going to go back in

3929
02:44:26,239 --> 02:44:32,318
for the the best of the rest later so so

3930
02:44:30,159 --> 02:44:34,239
I don't know a ton about the media I

3931
02:44:32,318 --> 02:44:36,478
really just kind of met the media Bros

3932
02:44:34,239 --> 02:44:38,119
recently and was talking to Adam about

3933
02:44:36,478 --> 02:44:39,959
them a little bit but is there a big

3934
02:44:38,120 --> 02:44:42,359
difference between these powdered and

3935
02:44:39,959 --> 02:44:44,519
granulated mediums like what this is

3936
02:44:42,359 --> 02:44:46,960
just for I guess it it quickens the

3937
02:44:44,520 --> 02:44:48,520
process or something or they all do a

3938
02:44:46,959 --> 02:44:49,799
different if you were to think of them

3939
02:44:48,520 --> 02:44:51,720
in the way that you think of your

3940
02:44:49,799 --> 02:44:54,719
different Bubble Bags can Target a

3941
02:44:51,719 --> 02:44:56,719
different triome size each media could

3942
02:44:54,719 --> 02:45:00,159
be designed to Target a different

3943
02:44:56,719 --> 02:45:02,599
chemical category particle

3944
02:45:00,159 --> 02:45:04,600
size um you know they could have a

3945
02:45:02,600 --> 02:45:06,600
different pH which is going to have a

3946
02:45:04,600 --> 02:45:08,720
different you know kind of reactivity

3947
02:45:06,600 --> 02:45:12,279
there's um they could each they're

3948
02:45:08,719 --> 02:45:13,599
individual Tools in a sense and

3949
02:45:12,279 --> 02:45:16,960
sometimes they're used together with

3950
02:45:13,600 --> 02:45:18,720
intention and sometimes not and

3951
02:45:16,959 --> 02:45:20,919
sometimes that intention is to you know

3952
02:45:18,719 --> 02:45:25,559
give a trash to gold and sometimes it's

3953
02:45:20,920 --> 02:45:28,520
to analyze or purify but they are you

3954
02:45:25,559 --> 02:45:30,398
know even when they are similar they're

3955
02:45:28,520 --> 02:45:32,000
extremely unique you know it's kind of

3956
02:45:30,398 --> 02:45:34,959
like uh someone brought up the W1

3957
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:37,959
earlier which is not the same as you

3958
02:45:34,959 --> 02:45:39,799
know just an alumina or a clay that's

3959
02:45:37,959 --> 02:45:41,199
been ground to a specific size each of

3960
02:45:39,799 --> 02:45:44,719
them can be

3961
02:45:41,200 --> 02:45:47,640
really really uniquely applied okay

3962
02:45:44,719 --> 02:45:49,639
interesting or used frivolously you know

3963
02:45:47,639 --> 02:45:51,799
or used frivolously well that's what I

3964
02:45:49,639 --> 02:45:53,079
it was interesting to hear horge talking

3965
02:45:51,799 --> 02:45:55,239
about how it was like yeah when we

3966
02:45:53,079 --> 02:45:57,079
started using it we just used it like in

3967
02:45:55,239 --> 02:45:59,719
small amounts and he's like the kind of

3968
02:45:57,079 --> 02:46:01,439
problem was people came in and were like

3969
02:45:59,719 --> 02:46:03,318
you know just stripped everything out of

3970
02:46:01,439 --> 02:46:05,639
there kind of thing so like I said I

3971
02:46:03,318 --> 02:46:07,159
don't have a huge uh experience with

3972
02:46:05,639 --> 02:46:10,439
this it's definitely interesting to talk

3973
02:46:07,159 --> 02:46:14,079
about though Clays Clays are layered

3974
02:46:10,439 --> 02:46:15,920
silicates okay so unlike silica gel

3975
02:46:14,079 --> 02:46:18,000
which is just silica particles right

3976
02:46:15,920 --> 02:46:20,040
macroporous silica particles right which

3977
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:23,639
are the same kinds of of things that are

3978
02:46:20,040 --> 02:46:25,960
in some hlc columns most hlc's are

3979
02:46:23,639 --> 02:46:29,478
running what's called reverse phase and

3980
02:46:25,959 --> 02:46:31,119
so they actually have a fat soluble Mo

3981
02:46:29,478 --> 02:46:33,318
that holds on to the compounds and

3982
02:46:31,120 --> 02:46:36,840
separates the compounds all based on

3983
02:46:33,318 --> 02:46:38,600
polarity but but silicates are just yeah

3984
02:46:36,840 --> 02:46:41,719
there's a variety of different kinds

3985
02:46:38,600 --> 02:46:44,520
there's actually Nano silicates called

3986
02:46:41,719 --> 02:46:47,159
halite but yeah banite Clays are just

3987
02:46:44,520 --> 02:46:49,319
they're layered silicates and so in

3988
02:46:47,159 --> 02:46:51,359
between the layers of silica you could

3989
02:46:49,318 --> 02:46:54,239
basically trap all kinds of compounds

3990
02:46:51,359 --> 02:46:56,800
it's typically based on the size of the

3991
02:46:54,239 --> 02:46:59,000
compound whether or not it could fit in

3992
02:46:56,799 --> 02:47:01,039
the interstitial space between the

3993
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:03,799
layered silicates sometimes you'll hear

3994
02:47:01,040 --> 02:47:07,040
about exfoliated Clays what exfoliated

3995
02:47:03,799 --> 02:47:10,799
Clays are is when they peel away those

3996
02:47:07,040 --> 02:47:14,279
layers um to basically make you know

3997
02:47:10,799 --> 02:47:18,278
non-layered silicate but yeah so anyway

3998
02:47:14,279 --> 02:47:18,279
a little chemistry on silicates

3999
02:47:19,000 --> 02:47:23,719
appreciate it Mark I I ask a chemistry

4000
02:47:22,239 --> 02:47:25,799
question to a chemist you're gonna get a

4001
02:47:23,719 --> 02:47:27,639
chemistry answer right yeah I I played

4002
02:47:25,799 --> 02:47:29,039
the media Bros little video while you

4003
02:47:27,639 --> 02:47:32,159
were while you were doing it I'm like

4004
02:47:29,040 --> 02:47:34,240
getting all fancy over here with my uh

4005
02:47:32,159 --> 02:47:36,039
uh my hash church but no I appreciate

4006
02:47:34,239 --> 02:47:37,639
the conversation today you also have

4007
02:47:36,040 --> 02:47:39,520
your hand raised but I guess you've

4008
02:47:37,639 --> 02:47:42,680
already spoke so we'll go back to Jorge

4009
02:47:39,520 --> 02:47:44,720
who uh has his hand up again go ahead

4010
02:47:42,680 --> 02:47:46,559
hor okay yeah I just want to kind of

4011
02:47:44,719 --> 02:47:48,438
touch on the media too it's kind of like

4012
02:47:46,559 --> 02:47:50,278
I like to look at it like Photoshop so

4013
02:47:48,439 --> 02:47:52,479
you have all these tools on the left

4014
02:47:50,279 --> 02:47:54,680
side you know and each one of these

4015
02:47:52,478 --> 02:47:56,840
medias because they're different in PH

4016
02:47:54,680 --> 02:47:58,760
or structure like bentonites like a

4017
02:47:56,840 --> 02:48:02,000
guess like a generic word for claz there

4018
02:47:58,760 --> 02:48:04,120
like kalanit meti had a pull guide like

4019
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:06,799
and all these are going to pull or have

4020
02:48:04,120 --> 02:48:10,240
like a stronger affinity for something

4021
02:48:06,799 --> 02:48:11,599
else than the other you know so once you

4022
02:48:10,239 --> 02:48:13,719
understand all these things and test

4023
02:48:11,600 --> 02:48:15,479
them and know how they work you can

4024
02:48:13,719 --> 02:48:17,599
basically have Like Your Arsenal of

4025
02:48:15,478 --> 02:48:19,679
tools like Murphy was saying and and

4026
02:48:17,600 --> 02:48:22,200
come in with a purpose so if you're

4027
02:48:19,680 --> 02:48:24,439
going to say crystallize the reason like

4028
02:48:22,200 --> 02:48:26,880
W1 would work is because it's acidic so

4029
02:48:24,439 --> 02:48:28,479
once you turn the solution acidic the

4030
02:48:26,879 --> 02:48:31,159
extract is going to crystallize a lot

4031
02:48:28,478 --> 02:48:34,639
better versus something that's say basic

4032
02:48:31,159 --> 02:48:36,279
or neutral and same thing so just

4033
02:48:34,639 --> 02:48:38,959
depends on your purpose if your purpose

4034
02:48:36,279 --> 02:48:41,279
is to bleach then and you have something

4035
02:48:38,959 --> 02:48:43,478
that's higher in in contamination then

4036
02:48:41,279 --> 02:48:46,560
you would go for something that's more

4037
02:48:43,478 --> 02:48:48,119
atic and vice versa you know what I mean

4038
02:48:46,559 --> 02:48:49,639
so the these are all just basically

4039
02:48:48,120 --> 02:48:51,720
tools and

4040
02:48:49,639 --> 02:48:54,599
we should get like more knowledgeable on

4041
02:48:51,719 --> 02:48:57,039
them to be able to uh basically perform

4042
02:48:54,600 --> 02:48:59,760
better like CRC extracts instead of just

4043
02:48:57,040 --> 02:49:01,080
coming in and stripping everything I

4044
02:48:59,760 --> 02:49:03,200
think there's a huge opportunity for

4045
02:49:01,079 --> 02:49:05,200
Education here because what I'm seeing

4046
02:49:03,200 --> 02:49:07,640
in the market is mostly people want like

4047
02:49:05,200 --> 02:49:09,960
the easy button and not a lot of

4048
02:49:07,639 --> 02:49:11,559
extractors want to learn or like really

4049
02:49:09,959 --> 02:49:13,199
have that much expertise in like what

4050
02:49:11,559 --> 02:49:15,639
are the use cases of each of these

4051
02:49:13,200 --> 02:49:19,079
different compounds and and how to kind

4052
02:49:15,639 --> 02:49:21,199
of use them with Precision so a lot of

4053
02:49:19,079 --> 02:49:23,039
the time it's just like the goal is just

4054
02:49:21,200 --> 02:49:25,399
to lighten the color or to have a

4055
02:49:23,040 --> 02:49:27,080
consistent marketable color for the

4056
02:49:25,398 --> 02:49:30,398
product and so they're just looking for

4057
02:49:27,079 --> 02:49:32,079
like Fast flow um so that it doesn't uh

4058
02:49:30,398 --> 02:49:33,879
slow down their extraction process and

4059
02:49:32,079 --> 02:49:36,359
they're just running everything through

4060
02:49:33,879 --> 02:49:38,398
CRC um as just kind of like the standard

4061
02:49:36,359 --> 02:49:41,399
operating procedure because a lot of

4062
02:49:38,398 --> 02:49:43,639
this is kind of like top down um you

4063
02:49:41,398 --> 02:49:45,799
know from management type of thing like

4064
02:49:43,639 --> 02:49:47,519
directives and not necessarily coming

4065
02:49:45,799 --> 02:49:50,799
from like where Murphy is coming from

4066
02:49:47,520 --> 02:49:53,238
with like precision like science yeah

4067
02:49:50,799 --> 02:49:56,278
absolutely I had to overly invest in

4068
02:49:53,238 --> 02:49:59,959
that too I think part of this comes from

4069
02:49:56,279 --> 02:50:03,960
if if I I might not see my potency

4070
02:49:59,959 --> 02:50:06,599
change at all only my yield going in and

4071
02:50:03,959 --> 02:50:08,879
out of a specific media and so if that's

4072
02:50:06,600 --> 02:50:10,920
the only number I can measure is potency

4073
02:50:08,879 --> 02:50:14,318
and turbines which we know aren't going

4074
02:50:10,920 --> 02:50:17,000
to be impacted by a specific Medias then

4075
02:50:14,318 --> 02:50:19,278
how do I measure that change in the

4076
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:21,000
flavor positive or negative you know we

4077
02:50:19,279 --> 02:50:23,000
need a data point we all need to start

4078
02:50:21,000 --> 02:50:25,559
sending samples to Marshall I think

4079
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:27,600
maybe you know something well well the

4080
02:50:25,559 --> 02:50:29,238
man with all the flavors has his hand up

4081
02:50:27,600 --> 02:50:32,079
so Yari what do you have to say about

4082
02:50:29,238 --> 02:50:34,920
that so um I just wanted to add and

4083
02:50:32,079 --> 02:50:37,719
point out a couple things so um like I

4084
02:50:34,920 --> 02:50:39,040
said before CRC is a good tool and you

4085
02:50:37,719 --> 02:50:41,318
really need to

4086
02:50:39,040 --> 02:50:43,800
know this this kind of goes back to the

4087
02:50:41,318 --> 02:50:46,398
grow things like if you know the strains

4088
02:50:43,799 --> 02:50:49,679
that you're growing incredibly well you

4089
02:50:46,398 --> 02:50:51,439
can adjust appropriately to what

4090
02:50:49,680 --> 02:50:55,439
individual powders that you're trying to

4091
02:50:51,439 --> 02:50:56,920
use to do like their individual job and

4092
02:50:55,439 --> 02:50:58,318
what I mean by that is like I've had

4093
02:50:56,920 --> 02:51:01,238
friends of mine that have come to me

4094
02:50:58,318 --> 02:51:03,879
where we've run their extract before and

4095
02:51:01,238 --> 02:51:06,680
it's it's strain specific but some of

4096
02:51:03,879 --> 02:51:09,398
them are so overwhelming with the tpin

4097
02:51:06,680 --> 02:51:13,318
and in their HT and everything that they

4098
02:51:09,398 --> 02:51:15,760
almost need a light CRC uh and finding

4099
02:51:13,318 --> 02:51:17,639
that right media which doesn't muddle

4100
02:51:15,760 --> 02:51:19,760
that the the big problem with the CRC

4101
02:51:17,639 --> 02:51:21,559
thing is that if like you guys were

4102
02:51:19,760 --> 02:51:23,719
saying if you strip it too much strip

4103
02:51:21,559 --> 02:51:28,318
everything away the taste is awful or

4104
02:51:23,719 --> 02:51:30,760
Bland or not there whatsoever so um

4105
02:51:28,318 --> 02:51:33,840
knowing the cultivar and knowing what

4106
02:51:30,760 --> 02:51:36,520
individual CRC powder does you can play

4107
02:51:33,840 --> 02:51:38,520
that to your advantage um I have gotten

4108
02:51:36,520 --> 02:51:40,319
to the point where I don't CRC anything

4109
02:51:38,520 --> 02:51:42,238
myself because I found the sweet spot on

4110
02:51:40,318 --> 02:51:44,398
where to take down the Plant where it

4111
02:51:42,238 --> 02:51:46,520
was at their their Peak within a couple

4112
02:51:44,398 --> 02:51:48,639
days um a friend of mine gave me a

4113
02:51:46,520 --> 02:51:50,279
little hint on that that you we did do

4114
02:51:48,639 --> 02:51:52,439
analytical testing to find when a

4115
02:51:50,279 --> 02:51:55,439
certain cambon oid dropped to a certain

4116
02:51:52,439 --> 02:51:58,279
percent was at the peak of the strain so

4117
02:51:55,439 --> 02:52:01,439
doing that and then like I said running

4118
02:51:58,279 --> 02:52:04,279
stuff for other people um when when the

4119
02:52:01,439 --> 02:52:06,800
the turps are overwhelming can still I

4120
02:52:04,279 --> 02:52:08,439
mean no one will know that it was CRC if

4121
02:52:06,799 --> 02:52:10,278
they've if they've done a good job and

4122
02:52:08,439 --> 02:52:11,720
used the appropriate amount of powders I

4123
02:52:10,279 --> 02:52:13,439
think they get misused and that's what

4124
02:52:11,719 --> 02:52:16,119
screwed everything up in the

4125
02:52:13,439 --> 02:52:18,238
industry just like everything right it's

4126
02:52:16,120 --> 02:52:20,200
just always the same thing you you know

4127
02:52:18,238 --> 02:52:22,000
you you start out in this sort of

4128
02:52:20,200 --> 02:52:23,720
ignorance and then you gain knowledge

4129
02:52:22,000 --> 02:52:25,639
and sometimes that can lead you into

4130
02:52:23,719 --> 02:52:28,959
bias and then as you gain your

4131
02:52:25,639 --> 02:52:30,920
experience you sort of realize oh maybe

4132
02:52:28,959 --> 02:52:33,398
staying more over in the center and

4133
02:52:30,920 --> 02:52:35,960
gaining information all around me is a

4134
02:52:33,398 --> 02:52:38,920
better idea than then uh well I mean I

4135
02:52:35,959 --> 02:52:40,799
was completely insane I was just like uh

4136
02:52:38,920 --> 02:52:42,398
I was convinced everyone just had to

4137
02:52:40,799 --> 02:52:43,759
have full Mount bubble I just was like

4138
02:52:42,398 --> 02:52:45,719
of course you have to have this this is

4139
02:52:43,760 --> 02:52:47,719
the best this is the best because that's

4140
02:52:45,719 --> 02:52:49,199
what I thought and then i' meet I'd meet

4141
02:52:47,719 --> 02:52:51,959
people and they were like no this is the

4142
02:52:49,200 --> 02:52:54,279
best and I'd be like how can you even

4143
02:52:51,959 --> 02:52:56,799
say that and you know you just get over

4144
02:52:54,279 --> 02:52:58,760
your own like narcissism dude like just

4145
02:52:56,799 --> 02:53:01,799
let people have what they want to have

4146
02:52:58,760 --> 02:53:04,520
and let people explore and and uh at

4147
02:53:01,799 --> 02:53:07,159
this point in time I so my Affinity for

4148
02:53:04,520 --> 02:53:09,200
cannabis and cannabis extractions I just

4149
02:53:07,159 --> 02:53:11,238
think it all has its place it's all a

4150
02:53:09,200 --> 02:53:13,960
journey it's all Pathways and the more

4151
02:53:11,238 --> 02:53:15,760
we explore and the more we uncover

4152
02:53:13,959 --> 02:53:17,839
because like Murphy said like we don't

4153
02:53:15,760 --> 02:53:19,920
really do new [ __ ] it takes a long time

4154
02:53:17,840 --> 02:53:21,719
we got to do it's kind of like fish when

4155
02:53:19,920 --> 02:53:23,760
they would say I think Paige was

4156
02:53:21,719 --> 02:53:26,959
interviewed and the lady was like why

4157
02:53:23,760 --> 02:53:29,359
would you jam for 42 M for 42 minutes

4158
02:53:26,959 --> 02:53:31,639
and he's like well because so I could

4159
02:53:29,359 --> 02:53:34,479
hear like the 43rd minute you can't get

4160
02:53:31,639 --> 02:53:36,680
to the 433d minute of jamming without

4161
02:53:34,478 --> 02:53:40,278
doing the other 42 minutes you don't get

4162
02:53:36,680 --> 02:53:42,760
to hop skip over the jam the jam is the

4163
02:53:40,279 --> 02:53:44,600
journey and so I guess that's true for

4164
02:53:42,760 --> 02:53:47,279
cannabis and it's interesting because I

4165
02:53:44,600 --> 02:53:49,359
see it with cannabis that she doesn't

4166
02:53:47,279 --> 02:53:51,680
necessarily want people to cut corners

4167
02:53:49,359 --> 02:53:55,159
and find tricks she's always just like

4168
02:53:51,680 --> 02:53:57,479
no it's going to be you just have to I

4169
02:53:55,159 --> 02:54:00,559
think the day we stop trying to get

4170
02:53:57,478 --> 02:54:03,278
cannabis to bend the knee to us will be

4171
02:54:00,559 --> 02:54:05,039
the day that we truly find success with

4172
02:54:03,279 --> 02:54:07,200
uh with our relationship with cannabis

4173
02:54:05,040 --> 02:54:09,439
because prohibition tried to uh get

4174
02:54:07,200 --> 02:54:11,680
cannabis to bend the knee and it did not

4175
02:54:09,439 --> 02:54:14,720
work out let me tell you money was spent

4176
02:54:11,680 --> 02:54:16,639
people were jailed lives were ruined uh

4177
02:54:14,719 --> 02:54:17,959
and here we are all these years later

4178
02:54:16,639 --> 02:54:19,398
thank God we have an industry room we

4179
02:54:17,959 --> 02:54:20,559
can talk about this go ahead Mark you

4180
02:54:19,398 --> 02:54:23,079
look like you're anxious to say

4181
02:54:20,559 --> 02:54:26,799
something on happy and purple I just

4182
02:54:23,079 --> 02:54:29,840
realized who JM is so is that John Mark

4183
02:54:26,799 --> 02:54:32,079
what up hey John how are you good to see

4184
02:54:29,840 --> 02:54:34,359
you so I don't know if our hash Church

4185
02:54:32,079 --> 02:54:37,760
audience will remember but when I went

4186
02:54:34,359 --> 02:54:41,960
to visit Indra in uh

4187
02:54:37,760 --> 02:54:44,398
2017 I think uh John got inspired and

4188
02:54:41,959 --> 02:54:47,639
came down to injures too so we actually

4189
02:54:44,398 --> 02:54:50,559
met I think uh through a hash Church

4190
02:54:47,639 --> 02:54:53,159
connection and you were the first PhD

4191
02:54:50,559 --> 02:54:55,478
that I had met that uh wakes up with a

4192
02:54:53,159 --> 02:54:55,478
bong

4193
02:54:56,799 --> 02:55:01,959
rip well that was fun and we have to

4194
02:54:59,318 --> 02:55:06,238
thank John for hosting us we we had a

4195
02:55:01,959 --> 02:55:08,159
nice session Danny uh Danny from corova

4196
02:55:06,238 --> 02:55:10,318
who I think has been on the show before

4197
02:55:08,159 --> 02:55:13,760
but I think Marcus didn't we do an

4198
02:55:10,318 --> 02:55:17,238
episode from John's Place there I think

4199
02:55:13,760 --> 02:55:19,639
maybe I think we did it's possible it's

4200
02:55:17,238 --> 02:55:21,279
all muddled in fuddled in my brain we've

4201
02:55:19,639 --> 02:55:23,119
got like hundreds of these episodes

4202
02:55:21,279 --> 02:55:25,960
under the belt at this point in time so

4203
02:55:23,120 --> 02:55:30,920
it's kind of hard to uh remember eight

4204
02:55:25,959 --> 02:55:33,599
years ago right yeah exactly Marcus yes

4205
02:55:30,920 --> 02:55:35,359
John I just want to mention one more

4206
02:55:33,600 --> 02:55:37,479
thing before I sign off because I'm

4207
02:55:35,359 --> 02:55:40,840
running out of gas here I was in the

4208
02:55:37,478 --> 02:55:44,398
hospital all day yesterday uh my blood

4209
02:55:40,840 --> 02:55:46,799
sugar spiked to 500 and it was a very

4210
02:55:44,398 --> 02:55:49,159
difficult time for me I only managed to

4211
02:55:46,799 --> 02:55:52,920
survive it by the hair of my chinny chin

4212
02:55:49,159 --> 02:55:55,279
chin but uh what I wanted to mention

4213
02:55:52,920 --> 02:56:00,159
that one of the ways

4214
02:55:55,279 --> 02:56:04,760
of choosing how your extraction happens

4215
02:56:00,159 --> 02:56:08,920
is I used to run a coil from the

4216
02:56:04,760 --> 02:56:11,760
isobutane and I would hover it in a

4217
02:56:08,920 --> 02:56:14,879
bucket so that I could get the overhead

4218
02:56:11,760 --> 02:56:17,680
of the liquid nitrogen to cool the gas

4219
02:56:14,879 --> 02:56:20,238
to various temperatures and by doing

4220
02:56:17,680 --> 02:56:25,120
thus I managed to extract the very

4221
02:56:20,238 --> 02:56:26,959
lightest things first and so anyway it's

4222
02:56:25,120 --> 02:56:30,920
just I don't know if anybody's going to

4223
02:56:26,959 --> 02:56:34,559
do it what what is the CRC the uh air

4224
02:56:30,920 --> 02:56:37,000
conditioning stuff the magic dirt it's

4225
02:56:34,559 --> 02:56:39,840
the magic dirt

4226
02:56:37,000 --> 02:56:42,719
chromatography oh okay yeah it's just

4227
02:56:39,840 --> 02:56:45,238
column chromatography that's all John

4228
02:56:42,719 --> 02:56:47,519
all right well anyway I just wanted to

4229
02:56:45,238 --> 02:56:52,719
mention that that was a method that I

4230
02:56:47,520 --> 02:56:54,159
had developed used hi Johnny and uh glad

4231
02:56:52,719 --> 02:56:58,000

4240
02:57:23,639 --> 02:57:28,358
well thanks for being alive Indra and uh

4241

not alive and uh wow I didn't get to see

4243
02:57:31,559 --> 02:57:35,478

4244
02:57:33,680 --> 02:57:38,840
chat when I said I'm gonna bring someone

4245
02:57:35,478 --> 02:57:42,559

02:57:58,120 --> 02:58:02,560
big mistakes to learn to learn big

02:58:00,600 --> 02:58:05,040
things and we'll we'll we'll pray that

4255
02:58:02,559 --> 02:58:06,799
Johnny star is going to learn from this

I'm trying to keep it all together here

4273
02:58:50,439 --> 02:58:54,520
hey JM uh does your company build those

4274
02:58:52,799 --> 02:58:56,478
membrane filtration

4275
02:58:54,520 --> 02:58:59,000
systems

4276
02:58:56,478 --> 02:59:02,039
yep you guys are in

4277
02:58:59,000 --> 02:59:04,719
Washington uh Oregon Oregon up here near

4278
02:59:02,040 --> 02:59:07,399
Portland have you guys uh have you guys

4279
02:59:04,719 --> 02:59:09,599
used those with still cyon

4280
02:59:07,398 --> 02:59:13,238
extract uh

4281
02:59:09,600 --> 02:59:16,760
unofficially I know someone who

4282
02:59:13,238 --> 02:59:18,559
has I was at [ __ ] Creek about that

4283
02:59:16,760 --> 02:59:19,880
because like that's the one bottle that

4284
02:59:18,559 --> 02:59:22,559
people are starting to see is the

4285
02:59:19,879 --> 02:59:24,839
solvent recovery oh well solvent

4286
02:59:22,559 --> 02:59:29,079
recovery yeah I mean that's like the one

4287
02:59:24,840 --> 02:59:32,559
thing that you know Nano filtration does

4288
02:59:29,079 --> 02:59:35,318
very easily across the board that you

4289
02:59:32,559 --> 02:59:38,199
can you know be fully confident plug-and

4290
02:59:35,318 --> 02:59:39,519
play no issues or challenges because you

4291
02:59:38,200 --> 02:59:41,920
know we're working with natural products

4292
02:59:39,520 --> 02:59:45,439
here so the composition can vary quite a

4293
02:59:41,920 --> 02:59:47,639
bit totally and the other interesting

4294
02:59:45,439 --> 02:59:50,040
thing with um the mushrooms you know

4295
02:59:47,639 --> 02:59:51,719
it's the the sugars right yeah and

4296
02:59:50,040 --> 02:59:54,120
getting a more

4297
02:59:51,719 --> 02:59:56,478
concentrated extract you know away from

4298
02:59:54,120 --> 02:59:59,520
those sugars and there's tricks that can

4299
02:59:56,478 --> 03:00:02,760
be done uh that the membranes also come

4300
02:59:59,520 --> 03:00:04,960
in handy with to remove those to a great

4301
03:00:02,760 --> 03:00:06,880
degree but you know that's nothing that

4302
03:00:04,959 --> 03:00:10,719
we've worked

4303
03:00:06,879 --> 03:00:14,199
on okay to say but well I might like to

4304
03:00:10,719 --> 03:00:16,760
talk to you uh outside of the the the

4305
03:00:14,200 --> 03:00:18,560
chat about that because I'm pretty

4306
03:00:16,760 --> 03:00:19,920
interested yeah

4307
03:00:18,559 --> 03:00:21,879
yeah I'll make sure that you guys all

4308
03:00:19,920 --> 03:00:23,559
have access to one another uh

4309
03:00:21,879 --> 03:00:25,398
particularly just you know if there's

4310
03:00:23,559 --> 03:00:27,439
one particular or two particular or

4311
03:00:25,398 --> 03:00:28,760
every whatever you need just email me

4312
03:00:27,439 --> 03:00:32,040
and I'll make sure that you have the

4313
03:00:28,760 --> 03:00:34,719
right uh email for the right person yeah

4314
03:00:32,040 --> 03:00:37,319
I will say yard there's um there's quite

4315
03:00:34,719 --> 03:00:39,840
a few membranes uh that are used even in

4316
03:00:37,318 --> 03:00:42,680
like Preparatory uh chemistry for like

4317
03:00:39,840 --> 03:00:45,398
analysis that are for like removing um

4318
03:00:42,680 --> 03:00:47,559
sugars and fat specifically and I've

4319
03:00:45,398 --> 03:00:48,959
used quite a few of those with mushroom

4320
03:00:47,559 --> 03:00:52,278
extract

4321
03:00:48,959 --> 03:00:54,519
in an effort to test them because it's

4322
03:00:52,279 --> 03:00:57,960
not great you know um like I just won't

4323
03:00:54,520 --> 03:00:59,880
even put a a chocolate bar in my hplc

4324
03:00:57,959 --> 03:01:02,159
column anymore like you can just [ __ ]

4325
03:00:59,879 --> 03:01:05,920
ask somebody else to do it because I'm

4326
03:01:02,159 --> 03:01:07,318
not gonna you know be the one um and so

4327
03:01:05,920 --> 03:01:08,719
there's quite a few membranes that you

4328
03:01:07,318 --> 03:01:11,278
can get for that what I like about that

4329
03:01:08,719 --> 03:01:14,079
is you can get those in like you know

4330
03:01:11,279 --> 03:01:17,359
almost shring size um or like little cup

4331
03:01:14,079 --> 03:01:18,600
size you know um so you can do little

4332
03:01:17,359 --> 03:01:21,159
samples

4333
03:01:18,600 --> 03:01:22,680
before you go and get the big system so

4334
03:01:21,159 --> 03:01:24,318
you can figure out where you really do

4335
03:01:22,680 --> 03:01:26,159
have to scale cuz some of the good ones

4336
03:01:24,318 --> 03:01:29,600
for solvent want you to have a pretty

4337
03:01:26,159 --> 03:01:31,680
clean product and there's a lot of oily

4338
03:01:29,600 --> 03:01:35,040
fats in some of these mushrooms too

4339
03:01:31,680 --> 03:01:37,359
which is and that's why I asked because

4340
03:01:35,040 --> 03:01:38,560
it's such a more difficult oil to work

4341
03:01:37,359 --> 03:01:40,159
with because like I've heard of people

4342
03:01:38,559 --> 03:01:41,920
doing falling films with them and them

4343
03:01:40,159 --> 03:01:44,238
CL it completely clogging their line

4344
03:01:41,920 --> 03:01:46,478
I've made a lot of cement you know

4345
03:01:44,238 --> 03:01:50,159
liquid cement and I don't know what you

4346
03:01:46,478 --> 03:01:52,799
know do you guys know Coleman Shapiro

4347
03:01:50,159 --> 03:01:54,359
yep yeah he seems to be having having a

4348
03:01:52,799 --> 03:01:56,478
lot of fun doing that all these days

4349
03:01:54,359 --> 03:01:57,640
Corps extracts but yeah a lot of people

4350
03:01:56,478 --> 03:02:00,478
are out there clogging the bottom of

4351
03:01:57,639 --> 03:02:03,039
their fil reactor you know just we're

4352
03:02:00,478 --> 03:02:05,238
you know trying our best and uh one

4353
03:02:03,040 --> 03:02:07,600
thing I'd love to know um and maybe you

4354
03:02:05,238 --> 03:02:10,079
know J could work on this is um maybe we

4355
03:02:07,600 --> 03:02:12,840
could make those membranes out of a

4356
03:02:10,079 --> 03:02:15,398
mushroom derived products so they could

4357
03:02:12,840 --> 03:02:19,159
be more affordable to [ __ ]

4358
03:02:15,398 --> 03:02:21,358
with help us out man it just grows like

4359
03:02:19,159 --> 03:02:24,359
the mushroom just grows on the the

4360
03:02:21,359 --> 03:02:26,600
permeate tube and uh I mean Harvest

4361
03:02:24,359 --> 03:02:29,479
that's how we got it we stripped it from

4362
03:02:26,600 --> 03:02:33,960
a membrane you could grow a more

4363
03:02:29,478 --> 03:02:33,959
intentional one that'd be that'd be

4364
03:02:34,238 --> 03:02:39,119
dope yeah probably grow it right in the

4365
03:02:37,159 --> 03:02:40,600
housing yeah that's what I'm saying

4366
03:02:39,120 --> 03:02:42,880
that'd be

4367
03:02:40,600 --> 03:02:44,559
sick well I think it's time for a dab

4368
03:02:42,879 --> 03:02:46,839
what's everyone puffing on I just

4369
03:02:44,559 --> 03:02:48,079
smashed some Event Horizon from my last

4370
03:02:46,840 --> 03:02:52,040
dab I think I'm going to hit a

4371
03:02:48,079 --> 03:02:54,719
masterpiece 90 Micron first wash melt

4372
03:02:52,040 --> 03:02:56,640
sounds decent I'm not I'm not even

4373
03:02:54,719 --> 03:02:58,760
trying to plug this but I don't know if

4374
03:02:56,639 --> 03:03:01,039
you guys have ever smoked out of an

4375
03:02:58,760 --> 03:03:04,318
indux it's probably oh yeah I have an

4376
03:03:01,040 --> 03:03:05,960
indux the big table one yeah you have

4377
03:03:04,318 --> 03:03:09,119
the Murphy do you have the bird the new

4378
03:03:05,959 --> 03:03:11,879
one I don't have a new I have like a

4379
03:03:09,120 --> 03:03:14,760
maybe one of the first like commcial

4380
03:03:11,879 --> 03:03:17,119
verions it's like a record player I have

4381
03:03:14,760 --> 03:03:19,120
like I went on Amazon and bought like a

4382
03:03:17,120 --> 03:03:21,200
whole roll of tubing so I could just

4383
03:03:19,120 --> 03:03:23,920
like throw them away

4384
03:03:21,200 --> 03:03:26,520
carelessly um because in science you

4385
03:03:23,920 --> 03:03:29,639
just you know disposable plastic is part

4386
03:03:26,520 --> 03:03:32,920
of the job somehow um but it's a killer

4387
03:03:29,639 --> 03:03:34,799
unit it really it's too much work you

4388
03:03:32,920 --> 03:03:37,159
know like I need it built into a whole

4389
03:03:34,799 --> 03:03:39,079
table for it's for sensory science

4390
03:03:37,159 --> 03:03:41,680
that's for having friends over to do

4391
03:03:39,079 --> 03:03:43,920
sensory science like that is exactly

4392
03:03:41,680 --> 03:03:46,079
what that is for I will say and nice to

4393
03:03:43,920 --> 03:03:47,478
see Sam lighting up the Carta and I'll

4394
03:03:46,079 --> 03:03:51,359
let everyone tell what they're going to

4395
03:03:47,478 --> 03:03:53,920
pop on but I got I got this Dr Dabber

4396
03:03:51,359 --> 03:03:57,120
switch to recently and I didn't realize

4397
03:03:53,920 --> 03:03:59,079
it's an induction unit this thing is

4398
03:03:57,120 --> 03:04:00,880
actually pretty ridiculous I was

4399
03:03:59,079 --> 03:04:02,879
surprised I mean it's heavy duty it's

4400
03:04:00,879 --> 03:04:05,159
not like a little small portable unit

4401
03:04:02,879 --> 03:04:07,438
even though I've literally carried like

4402
03:04:05,159 --> 03:04:10,398
Elite motherships around in pelican

4403
03:04:07,439 --> 03:04:12,159
cases onto the black ho home Mountain to

4404
03:04:10,398 --> 03:04:14,439
rip dabs while I'm snowboarding in the

4405
03:04:12,159 --> 03:04:17,279
middle of the day or take out on my sled

4406
03:04:14,439 --> 03:04:19,159
sled to the pton ice caps and do rips in

4407
03:04:17,279 --> 03:04:21,520
an ice cave that's like a you know

4408
03:04:19,159 --> 03:04:23,559
40,000 years old or whatever but I will

4409
03:04:21,520 --> 03:04:26,640
say that this thing is pretty [ __ ]

4410
03:04:23,559 --> 03:04:29,278
cool uh if you get a chance to rip one

4411
03:04:26,639 --> 03:04:31,519
and you're a big anyone that's into

4412
03:04:29,279 --> 03:04:34,920
flavor um

4413
03:04:31,520 --> 03:04:37,560
obviously uh induction heat is kind of

4414
03:04:34,920 --> 03:04:39,040
as long as it's delicate induction heat

4415
03:04:37,559 --> 03:04:41,359
I will say I don't know a ton about it

4416
03:04:39,040 --> 03:04:44,640
but I do know that I have probably nine

4417
03:04:41,359 --> 03:04:47,960
different units including uh Riley's um

4418
03:04:44,639 --> 03:04:49,719
indux Labs unit as well as I spire uh

4419
03:04:47,959 --> 03:04:51,879
the one Luna gave me in Berlin and and

4420
03:04:49,719 --> 03:04:53,959
and a variety of other units there are

4421
03:04:51,879 --> 03:04:56,959
some that are just too much they just

4422
03:04:53,959 --> 03:04:59,039
they their lowest tap when they start is

4423
03:04:56,959 --> 03:05:02,278
just way too high but like the indux

4424
03:04:59,040 --> 03:05:04,800
labs and as well as this unit I can turn

4425
03:05:02,279 --> 03:05:07,920
it down so low that I can take rips of

4426
03:05:04,799 --> 03:05:11,799
my dabs and have them taste different

4427
03:05:07,920 --> 03:05:13,559
like really different uh with the low to

4428
03:05:11,799 --> 03:05:15,199
the medium to the high I feel like

4429
03:05:13,559 --> 03:05:16,559
Marshall's like ready to say something

4430
03:05:15,200 --> 03:05:18,439
he's like turned his camera on he's like

4431
03:05:16,559 --> 03:05:20,318
what are we talking about s science here

4432
03:05:18,439 --> 03:05:22,559
I got some [ __ ] to say I got a PhD go

4433
03:05:20,318 --> 03:05:22,559
ahead

4434
03:05:22,760 --> 03:05:28,279
Marshall oh yeah just in general I mean

4435
03:05:26,079 --> 03:05:29,680
it's so all almost all the work I did in

4436
03:05:28,279 --> 03:05:32,079
the Hop industry was connecting the

4437
03:05:29,680 --> 03:05:34,200
sensory to the analytical work for beers

4438
03:05:32,079 --> 03:05:35,359
uh and hops and hop extracts and things

4439
03:05:34,200 --> 03:05:37,720
and so it's fun to be able to work in

4440
03:05:35,359 --> 03:05:40,439
the canos world as well I'm working with

4441
03:05:37,719 --> 03:05:42,398
mostly him so I can't even imagine you

4442
03:05:40,439 --> 03:05:46,279
know what we could do getting hands on

4443
03:05:42,398 --> 03:05:48,358
on good real uh material like you guys

4444
03:05:46,279 --> 03:05:51,319
have so

4445
03:05:48,359 --> 03:05:53,359
it's just a Messier output you know like

4446
03:05:51,318 --> 03:05:55,680
I thought I thought having a gcms would

4447
03:05:53,359 --> 03:05:59,040
be cool and it turns out it's just work

4448
03:05:55,680 --> 03:06:01,120
like you feel no progress ever you just

4449
03:05:59,040 --> 03:06:02,960
start you know you you stop running it

4450
03:06:01,120 --> 03:06:05,200
longer you're like if because it'll keep

4451
03:06:02,959 --> 03:06:09,318
[ __ ] will keep showing up you're never

4452
03:06:05,200 --> 03:06:11,479
done so you know it's um it's really

4453
03:06:09,318 --> 03:06:13,719
cool science but it is it is really hard

4454
03:06:11,478 --> 03:06:16,519
work to break those compounds all the

4455
03:06:13,719 --> 03:06:18,599
way down in a way to analyze them and

4456
03:06:16,520 --> 03:06:21,560
what's tough is that our ability to

4457
03:06:18,600 --> 03:06:24,359
perceive it you know is a lot more

4458
03:06:21,559 --> 03:06:27,600
sensitive so it's like these really

4459
03:06:24,359 --> 03:06:30,200
complex analytical instruments still

4460
03:06:27,600 --> 03:06:32,559
can't tell apart the like you know that

4461
03:06:30,200 --> 03:06:34,840
black pepper versus the white pepper in

4462
03:06:32,559 --> 03:06:39,199
a way that we can and I'm like damn you

4463
03:06:34,840 --> 03:06:42,520
know we really are still pretty far from

4464
03:06:39,200 --> 03:06:46,439
automating that oh yeah

4465
03:06:42,520 --> 03:06:48,960
and and to know with certainty too I

4466
03:06:46,439 --> 03:06:52,238
mean I would have an existential crisis

4467
03:06:48,959 --> 03:06:54,719
if I was an analytical chemist that's

4468
03:06:52,238 --> 03:06:55,879
what I've said for years because yeah

4469
03:06:54,719 --> 03:06:58,478
when you get into the weights with that

4470
03:06:55,879 --> 03:07:00,719
it's like wow how do we know anything is

4471
03:06:58,478 --> 03:07:03,358
anything you know and you could be wrong

4472
03:07:00,719 --> 03:07:06,559
for so long you could you could trick

4473
03:07:03,359 --> 03:07:09,159
yourself and make a peak out of anything

4474
03:07:06,559 --> 03:07:12,478
oh yeah you know and you're right about

4475
03:07:09,159 --> 03:07:16,200
you know the sensory aspect and that is

4476
03:07:12,478 --> 03:07:17,840
the most important actually I got what I

4477
03:07:16,200 --> 03:07:18,600
call

4478
03:07:17,840 --> 03:07:22,439
the

4479
03:07:18,600 --> 03:07:26,760
gustometer so when we're dabbing I call

4480
03:07:22,439 --> 03:07:28,760
that gustometer you know Gusto flavor

4481
03:07:26,760 --> 03:07:32,318
like the food stuff you know the

4482
03:07:28,760 --> 03:07:35,159
olda you know ometry so yeah everybody

4483
03:07:32,318 --> 03:07:37,000
there you've got a gustometer in your

4484
03:07:35,159 --> 03:07:39,760
house already the most sensitive

4485
03:07:37,000 --> 03:07:41,639
analytical instrument um and yeah you

4486
03:07:39,760 --> 03:07:43,800
got to test stuff for Quality it's

4487
03:07:41,639 --> 03:07:45,439
important because there's all flavors I

4488
03:07:43,799 --> 03:07:48,639
mean we all know the issue with like

4489
03:07:45,439 --> 03:07:50,600
possible contaminants that even Rec Labs

4490
03:07:48,639 --> 03:07:53,840
aren't able to test for or don't know to

4491
03:07:50,600 --> 03:07:57,159
test for but you might to taste it

4492
03:07:53,840 --> 03:07:59,639
before you know anything so important to

4493
03:07:57,159 --> 03:08:02,159
try your dabs I'm interested about this

4494
03:07:59,639 --> 03:08:05,318
indu though because

4495
03:08:02,159 --> 03:08:07,159
I've it it's not a cheap instrument you

4496
03:08:05,318 --> 03:08:10,359
know that's probably the most fancy guts

4497
03:08:07,159 --> 03:08:13,680
of tacometer out there um do you find

4498
03:08:10,359 --> 03:08:16,000
that the Dr Dabber that is Marcus uh is

4499
03:08:13,680 --> 03:08:18,920
it similar in giving you that lower temp

4500
03:08:16,000 --> 03:08:21,799
range if you want it this this the it's

4501
03:08:18,920 --> 03:08:24,439
not as broad but there's at least a nice

4502
03:08:21,799 --> 03:08:27,318
enough sliver that makes it so nice to

4503
03:08:24,439 --> 03:08:29,520
have at your TBL toop the indux is like

4504
03:08:27,318 --> 03:08:31,359
a invite PE that's like in high school

4505
03:08:29,520 --> 03:08:33,120
when you set up the dungeon and Dragons

4506
03:08:31,359 --> 03:08:35,159
table invited your buddies over this is

4507
03:08:33,120 --> 03:08:37,640
not a thing you just do on the random

4508
03:08:35,159 --> 03:08:39,279
this is some [ __ ] you prepare for this

4509
03:08:37,639 --> 03:08:41,719
is like Hey we're going to do sensory

4510
03:08:39,279 --> 03:08:44,159
science with my buddies uh we'll be able

4511
03:08:41,719 --> 03:08:46,199
to test it at such low temperatures that

4512
03:08:44,159 --> 03:08:48,478
you're you know you're kind of ripping

4513
03:08:46,200 --> 03:08:50,200
monos more so so than anything and then

4514
03:08:48,478 --> 03:08:52,238
you can go through into the

4515
03:08:50,200 --> 03:08:54,520
sesquiterpenoids and get into these

4516
03:08:52,238 --> 03:08:57,520
completely different flavor profiles and

4517
03:08:54,520 --> 03:08:59,600
they [ __ ] hide each other from one

4518
03:08:57,520 --> 03:09:02,120
another you know like there's a reason

4519
03:08:59,600 --> 03:09:03,640
why we cure the monos out in flour

4520
03:09:02,120 --> 03:09:05,239
because you get this kind of like oh it

4521
03:09:03,639 --> 03:09:07,478
doesn't smell that good sometimes and

4522
03:09:05,238 --> 03:09:11,119
then you cure that out and now this this

4523
03:09:07,478 --> 03:09:13,278
new bouquet has arisen underneath you

4524
03:09:11,120 --> 03:09:15,840
know the one that is volatized off so

4525
03:09:13,279 --> 03:09:18,079
that in itself is going to be an

4526
03:09:15,840 --> 03:09:21,760
absolute art form in

4527
03:09:18,079 --> 03:09:24,000
how people you know cure or preserve

4528
03:09:21,760 --> 03:09:26,880
their material listen fresh frozen that

4529
03:09:24,000 --> 03:09:28,840
was uh at least in the Cannabis world

4530
03:09:26,879 --> 03:09:30,599
and you guys could speak to the butane

4531
03:09:28,840 --> 03:09:32,398
world and tell's got his hand up so

4532
03:09:30,600 --> 03:09:35,120
he'll be next but in the Cannabis world

4533
03:09:32,398 --> 03:09:37,920
it was you know flavor rule uh sorry the

4534
03:09:35,120 --> 03:09:40,399
bubble has world it was just all about

4535
03:09:37,920 --> 03:09:43,760
that flavor profile and what you how how

4536
03:09:40,398 --> 03:09:47,119
well you could get the flavor from the

4537
03:09:43,760 --> 03:09:49,800
plant profile to be like the same but

4538
03:09:47,120 --> 03:09:52,720
just completely concentrated to a point

4539
03:09:49,799 --> 03:09:54,119
where it's uh you know mind-numbing tell

4540
03:09:52,719 --> 03:09:57,000
uh why don't you go ahead youe your hand

4541
03:09:54,120 --> 03:10:01,120
up yeah um so this is something I think

4542
03:09:57,000 --> 03:10:04,040
a lot of BHO people can notice just from

4543
03:10:01,120 --> 03:10:05,680
leaving um leaving products in a vacuum

4544
03:10:04,040 --> 03:10:07,800
and doing doing some tests with the

4545
03:10:05,680 --> 03:10:09,760
vacuum and just smoking it it's

4546
03:10:07,799 --> 03:10:11,519
something that you notice like every

4547
03:10:09,760 --> 03:10:13,960
once you know you've got some things

4548
03:10:11,520 --> 03:10:16,600
that are just really blowout you know

4549
03:10:13,959 --> 03:10:19,599
really top end sort of on on the

4550
03:10:16,600 --> 03:10:21,559
Spectrum and if you vacuum longer you do

4551
03:10:19,600 --> 03:10:24,559
you you lose some of that perceptual

4552
03:10:21,559 --> 03:10:27,199
masking and you open up some of some of

4553
03:10:24,559 --> 03:10:29,478
the heavier turpins that just get blown

4554
03:10:27,200 --> 03:10:31,760
out by these things that like kind of

4555
03:10:29,478 --> 03:10:35,199
blow out your senses but don't don't

4556
03:10:31,760 --> 03:10:37,559
translate one to one to like the tongue

4557
03:10:35,200 --> 03:10:39,000
and olfactory experience and I that's

4558
03:10:37,559 --> 03:10:41,318
something I've definitely noticed from

4559
03:10:39,000 --> 03:10:42,799
the vacuum and that sometimes like

4560
03:10:41,318 --> 03:10:45,000
especially if I'm entering something for

4561
03:10:42,799 --> 03:10:47,679
a contest you know I'm going to hit it

4562
03:10:45,000 --> 03:10:49,920
and maybe V it try vacing some it a

4563
03:10:47,680 --> 03:10:52,238
little bit longer to see what happens to

4564
03:10:49,920 --> 03:10:54,559
it and see you know like okay if we take

4565
03:10:52,238 --> 03:10:56,520
some of the top end off will it will it

4566
03:10:54,559 --> 03:10:59,238
open up and and can we get some more out

4567
03:10:56,520 --> 03:11:03,920
of this or is this just sort of a very

4568
03:10:59,238 --> 03:11:07,039
topend you know um high pitch kind of

4569
03:11:03,920 --> 03:11:09,600
spectrum hey Marshall I I wonder if you

4570
03:11:07,040 --> 03:11:11,640
had any insights on maybe some things

4571
03:11:09,600 --> 03:11:13,920
like the way you know Murphy M said like

4572
03:11:11,639 --> 03:11:16,238
we're all going to be doing the same

4573
03:11:13,920 --> 03:11:18,000
things well have PE like maybe we should

4574
03:11:16,238 --> 03:11:19,719
be following a little closer behind the

4575
03:11:18,000 --> 03:11:21,760
Hops industry because you got the the

4576
03:11:19,719 --> 03:11:24,238
amount of millions of dollars like we we

4577
03:11:21,760 --> 03:11:26,159
talk about how expensive this work is

4578
03:11:24,238 --> 03:11:27,639
and how cannabis has really only done a

4579
03:11:26,159 --> 03:11:29,359
fraction of the work that needs to be

4580
03:11:27,639 --> 03:11:31,680
done because we're still fighting

4581
03:11:29,359 --> 03:11:33,880
margins and racing to the bottom to to

4582
03:11:31,680 --> 03:11:37,238
create our industry but beer has a foot

4583
03:11:33,879 --> 03:11:40,478
in the door it has money to invest the

4584
03:11:37,238 --> 03:11:43,879
Hops industry is [ __ ] big and so do

4585
03:11:40,478 --> 03:11:46,238
you see any advantages to you know some

4586
03:11:43,879 --> 03:11:48,238
of that stuff that was done to Hops with

4587
03:11:46,238 --> 03:11:50,000
hops in the anal analytical labs being

4588
03:11:48,238 --> 03:11:53,000
able to translate over to cannabis and

4589
03:11:50,000 --> 03:11:55,559
help our industry yeah absolutely in

4590
03:11:53,000 --> 03:11:57,520
fact that's kind of how I ended up here

4591
03:11:55,559 --> 03:11:59,359
was we had all that analytical equipment

4592
03:11:57,520 --> 03:12:01,319
right I learned a lot about these

4593
03:11:59,359 --> 03:12:03,040
compounds there's a huge overlap between

4594
03:12:01,318 --> 03:12:05,799
Hops and cannabis I mean obviously when

4595
03:12:03,040 --> 03:12:07,760
you go and ferment beer there's another

4596
03:12:05,799 --> 03:12:10,238
gigantic range of things that come into

4597
03:12:07,760 --> 03:12:13,639
play uh for changing the flavor and the

4598
03:12:10,238 --> 03:12:16,119
aroma but uh yeah I mean it's it's it's

4599
03:12:13,639 --> 03:12:18,559
not that difficult but analytically our

4600
03:12:16,120 --> 03:12:21,040
noses are better for very specific

4601
03:12:18,559 --> 03:12:24,760
components right because uh sulfur

4602
03:12:21,040 --> 03:12:28,040
compounds THS are tens of thousands of

4603
03:12:24,760 --> 03:12:30,359
times more potent per molecule than

4604
03:12:28,040 --> 03:12:32,319
almost all of the monot Turpin or zesco

4605
03:12:30,359 --> 03:12:34,559
Turpin right and that's where you get

4606
03:12:32,318 --> 03:12:37,719
these really crazy Aromas like burnt

4607
03:12:34,559 --> 03:12:41,039
rubber or armpit right there those are

4608
03:12:37,719 --> 03:12:43,199
the THS over concentrated and the other

4609
03:12:41,040 --> 03:12:44,560
class compounds in here are the alahh

4610
03:12:43,200 --> 03:12:46,439
and these are ones unfortunately that

4611
03:12:44,559 --> 03:12:48,719
are a lot of the bad Aromas you don't

4612
03:12:46,439 --> 03:12:51,159
want that you want to remediate in fact

4613
03:12:48,719 --> 03:12:52,920
bentonite clay specifically binds

4614
03:12:51,159 --> 03:12:55,159
selectively binds alahh and that's part

4615
03:12:52,920 --> 03:12:57,719
of why it does some remediation on older

4616
03:12:55,159 --> 03:12:59,478
material um but analytically they're

4617
03:12:57,719 --> 03:13:01,478
difficult and that's where I've loved to

4618
03:12:59,478 --> 03:13:03,519
see what I you know what I've learned is

4619
03:13:01,478 --> 03:13:05,079
that you've got to trust your nose and

4620
03:13:03,520 --> 03:13:06,520
your equipment if you know how to do it

4621
03:13:05,079 --> 03:13:08,559
and you got to know the limitations of

4622
03:13:06,520 --> 03:13:10,640
your equipment and your nose right the

4623
03:13:08,559 --> 03:13:12,318
sulfur compounds will blow out your

4624
03:13:10,639 --> 03:13:14,519
ability to smell the rest of the stuff

4625
03:13:12,318 --> 03:13:17,559
that's there and this is where the aging

4626
03:13:14,520 --> 03:13:19,238
and all the curing really comes into and

4627
03:13:17,559 --> 03:13:21,840
how you're doing that CU they have

4628
03:13:19,238 --> 03:13:24,920
different oxidation time frames so they

4629
03:13:21,840 --> 03:13:27,680
break down or volatilization so pulling

4630
03:13:24,920 --> 03:13:29,120
vacuum or heating it again doing all

4631
03:13:27,680 --> 03:13:31,359
these things are going to adjust the

4632
03:13:29,120 --> 03:13:33,840
relative concentrations and then give

4633
03:13:31,359 --> 03:13:36,079
you that Aroma you know that that Aroma

4634
03:13:33,840 --> 03:13:37,719
profile that you want from it and that's

4635
03:13:36,079 --> 03:13:39,559
where honestly the making concentrates

4636
03:13:37,719 --> 03:13:40,639
and extracts and things can be tricky

4637
03:13:39,559 --> 03:13:43,119
you can actually take something that's

4638
03:13:40,639 --> 03:13:44,318
beautiful and turn it into burnt rubber

4639
03:13:43,120 --> 03:13:45,800
right because you've now overc

4640
03:13:44,318 --> 03:13:47,439
concentrated a bunch of stuff in there

4641
03:13:45,799 --> 03:13:49,159
that's great and now youve got a burn it

4642
03:13:47,439 --> 03:13:52,079
off a little bit to get it back to where

4643
03:13:49,159 --> 03:13:53,760
you want it so that's if nothing else

4644
03:13:52,079 --> 03:13:55,398
I've learned a ton from the work that I

4645
03:13:53,760 --> 03:13:57,920
did there because we had the equipment

4646
03:13:55,398 --> 03:14:00,358
and we had the uh you know the money and

4647
03:13:57,920 --> 03:14:04,960
the time to spend doing this and we had

4648
03:14:00,359 --> 03:14:07,680
25 25 person trained sensory panel to

4649
03:14:04,959 --> 03:14:09,358
compare the sensory with work with the

4650
03:14:07,680 --> 03:14:11,238
analytical results that we were getting

4651
03:14:09,359 --> 03:14:12,559
from the lab and then we had the lab

4652
03:14:11,238 --> 03:14:14,840
equipment where we could analyze all

4653
03:14:12,559 --> 03:14:17,278
these things so um I would love to be

4654
03:14:14,840 --> 03:14:19,398
able to do that same work uh in this

4655
03:14:17,279 --> 03:14:21,760
industry again it's about finding the

4656
03:14:19,398 --> 03:14:23,639
equipment finding uh the places where we

4657
03:14:21,760 --> 03:14:26,079
can do this stuff because it's been not

4658
03:14:23,639 --> 03:14:27,519
allowed for so long I think that's a

4659
03:14:26,079 --> 03:14:29,079
part of it for sure and I think we're

4660
03:14:27,520 --> 03:14:31,238
going to be able to help you with that

4661
03:14:29,079 --> 03:14:34,719
by having you back on the show and maybe

4662
03:14:31,238 --> 03:14:35,959
doing a specific show on and you know I

4663
03:14:34,719 --> 03:14:38,398
was thinking this would be part of the

4664
03:14:35,959 --> 03:14:42,519
aromatic volatile compound show but

4665
03:14:38,398 --> 03:14:44,278
perhaps it's focused more on what we the

4666
03:14:42,520 --> 03:14:49,000
Cannabis industry can learn from the

4667
03:14:44,279 --> 03:14:52,399
Hops industry that had a 25 team sensory

4668
03:14:49,000 --> 03:14:55,760
group to learn about those Sops on how

4669
03:14:52,398 --> 03:14:57,398
to run a proper sensory team on how to

4670
03:14:55,760 --> 03:14:59,600
first of all I mean Nix told me this

4671
03:14:57,398 --> 03:15:03,199
from day one look step one is you have

4672
03:14:59,600 --> 03:15:04,920
to find out what your blind spots are

4673
03:15:03,200 --> 03:15:07,800
you need to identify what your blind

4674
03:15:04,920 --> 03:15:09,559
spots are what can't you perceive right

4675
03:15:07,799 --> 03:15:10,920
it's not that easy to figure out but you

4676
03:15:09,559 --> 03:15:13,439
need to figure it out and then the other

4677
03:15:10,920 --> 03:15:16,439
one was sort of like what are you

4678
03:15:13,439 --> 03:15:18,398
perceiving in more of a hyper manner

4679
03:15:16,439 --> 03:15:22,359
than what the rest of the group is it's

4680
03:15:18,398 --> 03:15:24,119
a little above you know that middle bar

4681
03:15:22,359 --> 03:15:25,199
you're you're you're hyper perceiving

4682
03:15:24,120 --> 03:15:26,479
certain things where you're like oh my

4683
03:15:25,199 --> 03:15:28,000
God can you guys smell that and everyone

4684
03:15:26,478 --> 03:15:30,119
else is like no I don't smell it the way

4685
03:15:28,000 --> 03:15:31,639
you do so we kind of got into those two

4686
03:15:30,120 --> 03:15:34,160
things and I thought man this is a

4687
03:15:31,639 --> 03:15:36,358
really interesting conversation that I

4688
03:15:34,159 --> 03:15:38,920
think I haven't really heard a lot in

4689
03:15:36,359 --> 03:15:40,760
the Cannabis industry that seems ripe

4690
03:15:38,920 --> 03:15:42,279
for hash church so you know maybe if

4691
03:15:40,760 --> 03:15:43,719
you're down for that we can get some of

4692
03:15:42,279 --> 03:15:45,640
the people that are on the panel today

4693
03:15:43,719 --> 03:15:47,478
and some other new people and we can we

4694
03:15:45,639 --> 03:15:50,439
can do a sensory

4695
03:15:47,478 --> 03:15:51,679
you know discussion of in regards to I'd

4696
03:15:50,439 --> 03:15:53,680
love to get some people from other

4697
03:15:51,680 --> 03:15:56,800
Industries as well although hops just

4698
03:15:53,680 --> 03:15:59,960
does translate so well because really

4699
03:15:56,799 --> 03:16:02,519
it's another aromatic inebriant that

4700
03:15:59,959 --> 03:16:04,639
people love worldwide and it has these

4701
03:16:02,520 --> 03:16:06,399
different shared I mean God it's a

4702
03:16:04,639 --> 03:16:08,238
there's relations for goodness sake so

4703
03:16:06,398 --> 03:16:10,719
did should bring in Rob and Mojave

4704
03:16:08,238 --> 03:16:14,039
they've been writing articles on of

4705
03:16:10,719 --> 03:16:15,719
course on hops um which is been

4706
03:16:14,040 --> 03:16:18,319
absolutely fascinating because of course

4707
03:16:15,719 --> 03:16:20,840
we've seen you know diseases cross right

4708
03:16:18,318 --> 03:16:22,439
hop and vroid right comes from hops

4709
03:16:20,840 --> 03:16:25,359
which is fascinating because when I was

4710
03:16:22,439 --> 03:16:28,439
at the Cannabis germ plasm Institute

4711
03:16:25,359 --> 03:16:31,040
from the USDA in Geneva New York uh last

4712
03:16:28,439 --> 03:16:33,639
year they were there's a section in

4713
03:16:31,040 --> 03:16:36,199
between when there was the the huge

4714
03:16:33,639 --> 03:16:39,278
homogeneous um field that was growing

4715
03:16:36,199 --> 03:16:42,120
517 different ascensions plus female

4716
03:16:39,279 --> 03:16:43,680
plus their the males with it but there

4717
03:16:42,120 --> 03:16:47,359
was a row that we went through and they

4718
03:16:43,680 --> 03:16:50,040
were growing hops on purpose so that I

4719
03:16:47,359 --> 03:16:52,040
thought was rather fascinating so uh I I

4720
03:16:50,040 --> 03:16:53,960
plan to talk to Larry smart and them and

4721
03:16:52,040 --> 03:16:56,520
ask them more about that

4722
03:16:53,959 --> 03:16:58,679
crossover because uh they're already

4723
03:16:56,520 --> 03:17:01,120
looking at at the USDA

4724
03:16:58,680 --> 03:17:04,840
level John has his hand up you want to

4725
03:17:01,120 --> 03:17:09,079
go ahead John yeah I just wanted to say

4726
03:17:04,840 --> 03:17:11,799
one I envy the beer industry for you

4727
03:17:09,079 --> 03:17:14,639
know how how much further ahead they are

4728
03:17:11,799 --> 03:17:16,959
than our industry in terms of what we're

4729
03:17:14,639 --> 03:17:19,000
talking about here we've got a long way

4730
03:17:16,959 --> 03:17:21,238
ways to go and you know one critical

4731
03:17:19,000 --> 03:17:23,760
difference and this ties back into

4732
03:17:21,238 --> 03:17:25,639
discussions that were happening earlier

4733
03:17:23,760 --> 03:17:30,880
uh between the two industries right now

4734
03:17:25,639 --> 03:17:33,079
is there is a huge lack of public

4735
03:17:30,879 --> 03:17:36,198
consumption you know what I'm saying

4736
03:17:33,079 --> 03:17:38,439
like legal public consumption with beer

4737
03:17:36,199 --> 03:17:40,640
you can go to a bar and get served up

4738
03:17:38,439 --> 03:17:43,120
and try all sorts of beers that you

4739
03:17:40,639 --> 03:17:45,639
would never go buy just a sixpack of to

4740
03:17:43,120 --> 03:17:48,359
try right you can try singles nothing

4741
03:17:45,639 --> 03:17:52,000
like that really exists at least here in

4742
03:17:48,359 --> 03:17:53,960
Oregon and most the US for hash and

4743
03:17:52,000 --> 03:17:58,359
that's going to affect too you know what

4744
03:17:53,959 --> 03:18:00,959
the consumer the retail side is um you

4745
03:17:58,359 --> 03:18:03,960
know demanding and I find that there's a

4746
03:18:00,959 --> 03:18:06,919
lot of people that just have not

4747
03:18:03,959 --> 03:18:09,000
experienced a proper dab and aren't

4748
03:18:06,920 --> 03:18:10,960
going to go and throw a bunch of money

4749
03:18:09,000 --> 03:18:12,799
out of gram that they've never tried

4750
03:18:10,959 --> 03:18:16,079
before God forbid they can't even smell

4751
03:18:12,799 --> 03:18:18,519
it before they buy it and um I think

4752
03:18:16,079 --> 03:18:21,159
that's a going to be a critical piece

4753
03:18:18,520 --> 03:18:23,479
tooo to lifting all this

4754
03:18:21,159 --> 03:18:26,039
forward that's why we keep repeating the

4755
03:18:23,478 --> 03:18:28,318
cycle you know because no one in a new

4756
03:18:26,040 --> 03:18:30,239
state can do anything other than see it

4757
03:18:28,318 --> 03:18:31,959
on Instagram they don't know what

4758
03:18:30,238 --> 03:18:34,559
they're looking for they're using all

4759
03:18:31,959 --> 03:18:37,599
the data they have basically

4760
03:18:34,559 --> 03:18:40,840
none exactly well in California they've

4761
03:18:37,600 --> 03:18:43,159
just allowed food um in dispensaries

4762
03:18:40,840 --> 03:18:45,000
besides you know uh for the first time

4763
03:18:43,159 --> 03:18:47,119
ever so I would expect to see some

4764
03:18:45,000 --> 03:18:49,359
pairings starting to happen you know

4765
03:18:47,120 --> 03:18:51,720
some chefs and more of that starting to

4766
03:18:49,359 --> 03:18:54,760
happen because you know uh more

4767
03:18:51,719 --> 03:18:57,799
legitimacy to to take place as well as I

4768
03:18:54,760 --> 03:19:01,000
would anticipate a a rise in dad bars

4769
03:18:57,799 --> 03:19:03,039
but the problem with Dad bars is is the

4770
03:19:01,000 --> 03:19:04,959
um the individual who thinks they have

4771
03:19:03,040 --> 03:19:06,439
the tolerance to handle it and those are

4772
03:19:04,959 --> 03:19:08,478
the people who we have to call the

4773
03:19:06,439 --> 03:19:11,318
ambulance for because they literally

4774
03:19:08,478 --> 03:19:13,840
pass out from being too high this is

4775
03:19:11,318 --> 03:19:16,920
where that proper sop comes in for

4776
03:19:13,840 --> 03:19:19,359
sensory experience of of extracts this

4777
03:19:16,920 --> 03:19:21,040
is the importance of like creating this

4778
03:19:19,359 --> 03:19:24,359
voice of authority and it's you know

4779
03:19:21,040 --> 03:19:28,640
it's it's so important and it's kind of

4780
03:19:24,359 --> 03:19:30,238
uh yeah I just uh I I hate to hear

4781
03:19:28,639 --> 03:19:33,959
people having bad experiences please go

4782
03:19:30,238 --> 03:19:36,799
ahead with that indu are you able to you

4783
03:19:33,959 --> 03:19:40,238
know at the lower end of the heat range

4784
03:19:36,799 --> 03:19:46,079
are you able to generate a vapor that is

4785
03:19:40,238 --> 03:19:48,760
mostly flavor and less 100% 100% that's

4786
03:19:46,079 --> 03:19:51,680
the thing like that you know I Envision

4787
03:19:48,760 --> 03:19:55,478
you know the wine and a wine and cheese

4788
03:19:51,680 --> 03:19:58,318
level of Hashi someday where people who

4789
03:19:55,478 --> 03:19:59,840
aren't really you know cannabis users

4790
03:19:58,318 --> 03:20:03,159
are able to

4791
03:19:59,840 --> 03:20:06,000
appreciate the wide wide range of

4792
03:20:03,159 --> 03:20:07,959
flavors this plant can produce and if

4793
03:20:06,000 --> 03:20:10,639
you're not a Dabber and you take even a

4794
03:20:07,959 --> 03:20:12,679
small dab you're gonna you're not going

4795
03:20:10,639 --> 03:20:15,000
to be able to enjoy the second one so

4796
03:20:12,680 --> 03:20:18,439
you know wondering how do we you know

4797
03:20:15,000 --> 03:20:21,760
someday be able to allow people to enjoy

4798
03:20:18,439 --> 03:20:24,120
the pallet that have no tolerance um and

4799
03:20:21,760 --> 03:20:26,800
even myself shoot this is this is the

4800
03:20:24,120 --> 03:20:30,160
work that Doctor Mark Lewis and Chimera

4801
03:20:26,799 --> 03:20:32,278
did at Neo which was to go through and

4802
03:20:30,159 --> 03:20:33,318
produce type two plants that are not

4803
03:20:32,279 --> 03:20:35,800
high in

4804
03:20:33,318 --> 03:20:38,198
thca and to create all the flavor

4805
03:20:35,799 --> 03:20:40,840
profiles that are available in type 1

4806
03:20:38,199 --> 03:20:43,000
plants and make them available in CBD

4807
03:20:40,840 --> 03:20:45,159
Shanti Baba's been selling CBD like

4808
03:20:43,000 --> 03:20:47,920
cigarettes in like the grocery stores in

4809
03:20:45,159 --> 03:20:50,920
Switzerland for like I want to say 20

4810
03:20:47,920 --> 03:20:52,600
years but maybe it's been longer now um

4811
03:20:50,920 --> 03:20:54,799
so there there is a whole world out

4812
03:20:52,600 --> 03:20:57,960
there that just wants to enjoy this the

4813
03:20:54,799 --> 03:21:00,478
flavors of cannabis and I think Neo is

4814
03:20:57,959 --> 03:21:03,159
probably ahead of the game in regards to

4815
03:21:00,478 --> 03:21:05,398
producing you know cultivars that it it

4816
03:21:03,159 --> 03:21:07,680
goes to kind of speaking like you know

4817
03:21:05,398 --> 03:21:09,478
it's the same with Edibles right like if

4818
03:21:07,680 --> 03:21:11,159
you're going to have or or these dinner

4819
03:21:09,478 --> 03:21:12,318
pairings that etan just mentioned if

4820
03:21:11,159 --> 03:21:14,719
you're going to have these types of

4821
03:21:12,318 --> 03:21:18,559
dinner pairings you better be down in

4822
03:21:14,719 --> 03:21:21,039
the 1 mgram range of of dosing ability

4823
03:21:18,559 --> 03:21:22,879
and honestly like my wife at at 1

4824
03:21:21,040 --> 03:21:25,319
milligram she's like going to be

4825
03:21:22,879 --> 03:21:27,839
uncomfortable soon so this is the

4826
03:21:25,318 --> 03:21:30,039
delicate nature of people's different

4827
03:21:27,840 --> 03:21:32,040
endoc canabo systems and how the

4828
03:21:30,040 --> 03:21:35,199
signaling system and how it interacts

4829
03:21:32,040 --> 03:21:36,800
it's just it's a delicate game that

4830
03:21:35,199 --> 03:21:38,880
we're GNA have to figure out over time

4831
03:21:36,799 --> 03:21:41,079
Murphy had her hand up so I want to go

4832
03:21:38,879 --> 03:21:44,079
go to her yeah I just didn't want to

4833
03:21:41,079 --> 03:21:46,159
lose the the train of thought there on

4834
03:21:44,079 --> 03:21:48,439
like I always tell people I'm not a

4835
03:21:46,159 --> 03:21:50,559
grower right like I'm I'm an extractor

4836
03:21:48,439 --> 03:21:53,199
and it's not because I don't know how to

4837
03:21:50,559 --> 03:21:56,159
grow I grow a lot of stuff actually you

4838
03:21:53,199 --> 03:21:59,760
know well known for my aloe uh as you

4839
03:21:56,159 --> 03:22:01,799
guys have heard but um you know I uh I

4840
03:21:59,760 --> 03:22:04,079
always say I'm not a grower because the

4841
03:22:01,799 --> 03:22:08,358
the way that you know Growers have to

4842
03:22:04,079 --> 03:22:10,079
approach problems is longterm you know

4843
03:22:08,359 --> 03:22:12,920
I'm complaining about the time it takes

4844
03:22:10,079 --> 03:22:15,559
to run a GC it takes way longer to grow

4845
03:22:12,920 --> 03:22:17,799
a new strain to feno hunt something you

4846
03:22:15,559 --> 03:22:19,799
know worth having and so it's really

4847
03:22:17,799 --> 03:22:21,959
cool that people are trying to cultivate

4848
03:22:19,799 --> 03:22:25,318
the lower potency and deliver that

4849
03:22:21,959 --> 03:22:28,639
flavor profile but it's also exactly the

4850
03:22:25,318 --> 03:22:31,079
job that everyone on this call is

4851
03:22:28,639 --> 03:22:33,358
supposed to be capable of like every

4852
03:22:31,079 --> 03:22:37,520
single one of us could

4853
03:22:33,359 --> 03:22:39,600
just get the flavor out you know and so

4854
03:22:37,520 --> 03:22:42,199
you know it's easy to blame the consumer

4855
03:22:39,600 --> 03:22:43,920
for focusing too much on THC but none of

4856
03:22:42,199 --> 03:22:47,040
us sell our

4857
03:22:43,920 --> 03:22:50,359
byproducts how many people are out there

4858
03:22:47,040 --> 03:22:53,120
buying cocoa butter and winterizing

4859
03:22:50,359 --> 03:22:55,359
under the same roof throwing away waxes

4860
03:22:53,120 --> 03:22:59,040
and buying waxes and shipping it like

4861
03:22:55,359 --> 03:23:01,520
we're crazy we have so much byproduct

4862
03:22:59,040 --> 03:23:03,640
that we used to promote cannabis and

4863
03:23:01,520 --> 03:23:05,238
hemp for legalization and then forgot

4864
03:23:03,639 --> 03:23:07,439
about when we started

4865
03:23:05,238 --> 03:23:10,478
manufacturing every single one of us

4866
03:23:07,439 --> 03:23:13,520
could be producing those byproduct

4867
03:23:10,478 --> 03:23:15,318
flavors from our you know current Supply

4868
03:23:13,520 --> 03:23:17,720
and if we worked with hemp instead of

4869
03:23:15,318 --> 03:23:19,519
against it you know we could we could

4870
03:23:17,719 --> 03:23:21,519
deliver those you know breeding

4871
03:23:19,520 --> 03:23:23,279
experiences but we could also

4872
03:23:21,520 --> 03:23:25,600
manufacture that and I think that's

4873
03:23:23,279 --> 03:23:28,439
where you know if the market that

4874
03:23:25,600 --> 03:23:31,640
doesn't want to get too high could

4875
03:23:28,439 --> 03:23:33,559
dab they'd be on our team that's our

4876
03:23:31,639 --> 03:23:36,719
fault we gave

4877
03:23:33,559 --> 03:23:38,920
everyone too high a potency in order to

4878
03:23:36,719 --> 03:23:41,238
get that flavor that's oh no we did we

4879
03:23:38,920 --> 03:23:43,478
did exactly what I did with the bubble

4880
03:23:41,238 --> 03:23:46,238
and teaching everyone to roll it all up

4881
03:23:43,478 --> 03:23:49,238
wet and cause years of hot dabs and

4882
03:23:46,238 --> 03:23:52,840
night nightmares and also whatever the

4883
03:23:49,238 --> 03:23:55,359
male Macho bravado whatever that was was

4884
03:23:52,840 --> 03:23:58,920
like yeah let's destroy them with a 900

4885
03:23:55,359 --> 03:24:01,840
degree half gr dab it was just like oh

4886
03:23:58,920 --> 03:24:04,478
my God what were we doing just putting

4887
03:24:01,840 --> 03:24:07,238
ourselves back like 10 15 20 years it'll

4888
03:24:04,478 --> 03:24:10,438
be fine I agree I think the ability to

4889
03:24:07,238 --> 03:24:12,520
create a proper you know so like for me

4890
03:24:10,439 --> 03:24:14,680
I've created it for myself I give people

4891
03:24:12,520 --> 03:24:16,159
dabs all the time I give elderly people

4892
03:24:14,680 --> 03:24:19,559
dabs that have never dabbed like in

4893
03:24:16,159 --> 03:24:21,199
their 80s and 90s and what I do and the

4894
03:24:19,559 --> 03:24:23,359
only way I've been able to do it because

4895
03:24:21,199 --> 03:24:26,359
and I'm pretty articulate but even if

4896
03:24:23,359 --> 03:24:29,159
the Dabber is is even just like a

4897
03:24:26,359 --> 03:24:33,120
titanium Dabber Dabber like this it's

4898
03:24:29,159 --> 03:24:35,840
too big you need a PIN to pull a pin

4899
03:24:33,120 --> 03:24:38,000
head out and then you really at first

4900
03:24:35,840 --> 03:24:40,359
that little pin drop is really about

4901
03:24:38,000 --> 03:24:41,600
getting them over the fear of and also

4902
03:24:40,359 --> 03:24:43,479
you got to get rid of the blowtorch that

4903
03:24:41,600 --> 03:24:45,640
blowtorch is it's freaking people out

4904
03:24:43,478 --> 03:24:47,599
nobody wants to see it it it scares

4905
03:24:45,639 --> 03:24:50,719
people it's not cool so you know shout

4906
03:24:47,600 --> 03:24:54,359
out to companies like like puffco and

4907
03:24:50,719 --> 03:24:58,198
Carta and and Dr Dabber and indu for

4908
03:24:54,359 --> 03:25:00,600
creating products that allow us to try

4909
03:24:58,199 --> 03:25:02,040
these products to to try these extracts

4910
03:25:00,600 --> 03:25:03,479
in the first place cuz you know to make

4911
03:25:02,040 --> 03:25:05,000
an extract like that and then just be

4912
03:25:03,478 --> 03:25:06,438
like what how you smoking it I'm just

4913
03:25:05,000 --> 03:25:09,398
going to roll it up in a joint man it's

4914
03:25:06,439 --> 03:25:12,079
like oh my God like just stab me through

4915
03:25:09,398 --> 03:25:14,959
the heart how I always burn it in a

4916
03:25:12,079 --> 03:25:16,920
cartridge that's really my heart yeah

4917
03:25:14,959 --> 03:25:20,039
that's that's that's a hder one too so

4918
03:25:16,920 --> 03:25:22,680
it is what it is but yeah it's uh kind

4919
03:25:20,040 --> 03:25:25,760
of lost my train of thought there but um

4920
03:25:22,680 --> 03:25:29,800
Sam's got his hand waving please I

4921
03:25:25,760 --> 03:25:32,800
wanted to mention that uh when we did

4922
03:25:29,799 --> 03:25:37,879
the analysis in

4923
03:25:32,799 --> 03:25:41,679
200 uh with a a team of subjects we used

4924
03:25:37,879 --> 03:25:45,759
a organoleptic uh survey with about a

4925
03:25:41,680 --> 03:25:47,000
100 questions and that might be

4926
03:25:45,760 --> 03:25:50,960
interesting

4927
03:25:47,000 --> 03:25:56,199
the other thing is that uh I do have one

4928
03:25:50,959 --> 03:25:59,000
of those uh induction pipes and I'll

4929
03:25:56,199 --> 03:26:02,120
tell you that absolutely gives me the

4930
03:25:59,000 --> 03:26:05,000
best Taste of any hits I've ever had but

4931
03:26:02,120 --> 03:26:07,680
that's only the first half of the hits

4932
03:26:05,000 --> 03:26:09,840
the last half of the hits just taste

4933
03:26:07,680 --> 03:26:12,639
like any other

4934
03:26:09,840 --> 03:26:15,040
pipe yeah it's definitely for extracting

4935
03:26:12,639 --> 03:26:17,238
the flavor profile it's like a like to

4936
03:26:15,040 --> 03:26:19,080
me it's an incredible tool for breeders

4937
03:26:17,238 --> 03:26:20,238
if you want to get to know your flavors

4938
03:26:19,079 --> 03:26:22,520
and you want to get to know your

4939
03:26:20,238 --> 03:26:24,959
bouquets and how they sit on top of one

4940
03:26:22,520 --> 03:26:27,840
another it's a it's a rabbit hole that

4941
03:26:24,959 --> 03:26:30,079
is well worth going down and it's a tool

4942
03:26:27,840 --> 03:26:32,719
that I'm personally surprised hasn't

4943
03:26:30,079 --> 03:26:34,520
been more more tuned because you know

4944
03:26:32,719 --> 03:26:36,559
there there's amazing machines proton

4945
03:26:34,520 --> 03:26:39,040
NMR and gas chromatograph but there's

4946
03:26:36,559 --> 03:26:41,398
also this thing called the old factory

4947
03:26:39,040 --> 03:26:43,439
and uh it's quite an amazing uh piece of

4948
03:26:41,398 --> 03:26:46,760
equipment that really puts those other

4949
03:26:43,439 --> 03:26:49,398
pieces of equipment borderline to shame

4950
03:26:46,760 --> 03:26:52,359
uh so use yours bioassay it's important

4951
03:26:49,398 --> 03:26:54,719
it's valuable there's definite value in

4952
03:26:52,359 --> 03:26:56,880
bioassay and sharing your experiences

4953
03:26:54,719 --> 03:26:59,438
with people so uh I love the science

4954
03:26:56,879 --> 03:27:01,198
aspect of it I I don't necessarily treat

4955
03:26:59,439 --> 03:27:03,600
it as much like the word of God because

4956
03:27:01,199 --> 03:27:05,720
I also like the uh the personal

4957
03:27:03,600 --> 03:27:09,960
experience of what the person has gone

4958
03:27:05,719 --> 03:27:13,198
through and uh and whatnot so so what

4959
03:27:09,959 --> 03:27:15,278
you touched on is something that is a

4960
03:27:13,199 --> 03:27:18,399
problem that we deal with every single

4961
03:27:15,279 --> 03:27:20,560
day in dispensaries is they come across

4962
03:27:18,398 --> 03:27:24,398
this concentrates and they're like well

4963
03:27:20,559 --> 03:27:28,119
how do I use it right that is still a

4964
03:27:24,398 --> 03:27:30,439
huge learning curve for somebody because

4965
03:27:28,120 --> 03:27:31,560
I originally came to concentrates back

4966
03:27:30,439 --> 03:27:34,359
in

4967
03:27:31,559 --> 03:27:36,639
200 uh you know 10 or so I already using

4968
03:27:34,359 --> 03:27:39,120
water hash but I was seeing people

4969
03:27:36,639 --> 03:27:41,799
buying BHO and other things and using it

4970
03:27:39,120 --> 03:27:45,040
and I was asking well why are you using

4971
03:27:41,799 --> 03:27:47,079
this and Murphy it is medically you know

4972
03:27:45,040 --> 03:27:50,120
it still is medically useful and people

4973
03:27:47,079 --> 03:27:52,559
do use it as medicine so I was watching

4974
03:27:50,120 --> 03:27:56,199
older patients buying these expensive

4975
03:27:52,559 --> 03:27:59,398
little jars and those that knew how to

4976
03:27:56,199 --> 03:28:03,760
because originally people were just

4977
03:27:59,398 --> 03:28:06,398
dropping the hash butane oil onto a coal

4978
03:28:03,760 --> 03:28:10,040
right once the coal had a burn off right

4979
03:28:06,398 --> 03:28:13,159
and then the titanium swings came in and

4980
03:28:10,040 --> 03:28:17,199
then titanium you know you had the the

4981
03:28:13,159 --> 03:28:19,760
the female and male you know

4982
03:28:17,199 --> 03:28:22,680
basically uh steps in the direction of

4983
03:28:19,760 --> 03:28:26,120
easier usage but it hasn't been until

4984
03:28:22,680 --> 03:28:28,800
recently that there have been electronic

4985
03:28:26,120 --> 03:28:30,920
entry points but even then for somebody

4986
03:28:28,799 --> 03:28:35,119
who's new to concentrates oh now I have

4987
03:28:30,920 --> 03:28:36,960
to buy something to use this because yes

4988
03:28:35,120 --> 03:28:39,760
my my torch scares the living [ __ ] out

4989
03:28:36,959 --> 03:28:41,639
of everybody every time I use it and

4990
03:28:39,760 --> 03:28:43,719
they're terrify but now you've got

4991
03:28:41,639 --> 03:28:45,079
things I'm I'm using the denail heater

4992
03:28:43,719 --> 03:28:48,959
right which is just a strictly

4993
03:28:45,079 --> 03:28:51,680
convection heater that heats my you know

4994
03:28:48,959 --> 03:28:54,438
my my uh my tool exactly to how I want

4995
03:28:51,680 --> 03:28:58,238
it but that's not an easy or cheap

4996
03:28:54,439 --> 03:29:02,079
expense so as you your professionals

4997
03:28:58,238 --> 03:29:04,719
here how do you teach people the most an

4998
03:29:02,079 --> 03:29:06,238
easiest entry point as opposed to you

4999
03:29:04,719 --> 03:29:08,039
know telling them to roll it into a

5000
03:29:06,238 --> 03:29:10,198
snake is its own Challenge and then

5001
03:29:08,040 --> 03:29:12,199
putting it into a joint good luck with

5002
03:29:10,199 --> 03:29:15,159
that and crumbling it in they put too

5003
03:29:12,199 --> 03:29:18,040
much in and then they're overdosing so

5004
03:29:15,159 --> 03:29:18,039
how do you help

5005
03:29:18,079 --> 03:29:25,000
people dip their toe into the water puff

5006
03:29:21,398 --> 03:29:26,599
Co is usually the best way in my opinion

5007
03:29:25,000 --> 03:29:28,680
uh justess because like like like you

5008
03:29:26,600 --> 03:29:30,600
guys were saying before the torch scares

5009
03:29:28,680 --> 03:29:33,840
the [ __ ] out of a lot of people but you

5010
03:29:30,600 --> 03:29:36,238
can hand you know a puffco with the

5011
03:29:33,840 --> 03:29:39,318
right amount of of concentrate in it to

5012
03:29:36,238 --> 03:29:41,680
you know a your girlfriend's dad and he

5013
03:29:39,318 --> 03:29:44,159
can rip that and it's opens like a whole

5014
03:29:41,680 --> 03:29:46,639
new experience for him so that's what

5015
03:29:44,159 --> 03:29:48,359
I've seen personally at least yeah and

5016
03:29:46,639 --> 03:29:51,920
the fancy lights you know that people

5017
03:29:48,359 --> 03:29:55,479
are like o what's that you got there old

5018
03:29:51,920 --> 03:29:57,238
boy go ahead Murphy um I just think uh

5019
03:29:55,478 --> 03:30:01,559
it it's definitely an education thing

5020
03:29:57,238 --> 03:30:03,959
but we we need to follow suit with other

5021
03:30:01,559 --> 03:30:06,119
Industries and so you know when I think

5022
03:30:03,959 --> 03:30:09,198
about the type of glass you're supposed

5023
03:30:06,120 --> 03:30:10,640
to drink wine out of and the shape of it

5024
03:30:09,199 --> 03:30:12,319
and the length of it and the type of

5025
03:30:10,639 --> 03:30:15,079
glass you're supposed to drink Scotch

5026
03:30:12,318 --> 03:30:17,879
out of you know and so you can drink it

5027
03:30:15,079 --> 03:30:20,000
out of literally whatever cup you want

5028
03:30:17,879 --> 03:30:21,398
sure you don't have to buy a puff coat

5029
03:30:20,000 --> 03:30:23,040
you don't have to buy an induction

5030
03:30:21,398 --> 03:30:25,680
heater you don't have to stay plugged

5031
03:30:23,040 --> 03:30:28,040
into the wall um I have like a little

5032
03:30:25,680 --> 03:30:30,238
laser one I finally got one that I can

5033
03:30:28,040 --> 03:30:32,880
dab with a laser I'm delighted by it but

5034
03:30:30,238 --> 03:30:36,520
like all of this requires an investment

5035
03:30:32,879 --> 03:30:38,278
and so it is a barrier to entry um

5036
03:30:36,520 --> 03:30:40,238
however for a medical product I think

5037
03:30:38,279 --> 03:30:41,640
there's a good justification for that

5038
03:30:40,238 --> 03:30:44,039
which is that if you want accurate

5039
03:30:41,639 --> 03:30:47,039
dosing you need accurate temperature

5040
03:30:44,040 --> 03:30:49,359
control and you know there's a lot to it

5041
03:30:47,040 --> 03:30:51,840
when when we're dabbing we're distilling

5042
03:30:49,359 --> 03:30:54,640
and if the condensing arm on my

5043
03:30:51,840 --> 03:30:57,439
distillation unit is a different size a

5044
03:30:54,639 --> 03:30:59,119
different angle a different temperature

5045
03:30:57,439 --> 03:31:01,760
if the vacuum is operating at a

5046
03:30:59,120 --> 03:31:04,199
different depth or CFM you know I'm

5047
03:31:01,760 --> 03:31:05,760
going to get a different separation and

5048
03:31:04,199 --> 03:31:08,399
experience and the same would be true

5049
03:31:05,760 --> 03:31:10,840
for the way that you're dabbing and we

5050
03:31:08,398 --> 03:31:14,398
could talk about it in that

5051
03:31:10,840 --> 03:31:16,040
really burdensome complicated way that's

5052
03:31:14,398 --> 03:31:17,879
kind of like when I have a chemistry

5053
03:31:16,040 --> 03:31:19,960
question I take it to Mark the first

5054
03:31:17,879 --> 03:31:21,799
version is going to be too complicated

5055
03:31:19,959 --> 03:31:23,438
and then right after that gets out we

5056
03:31:21,799 --> 03:31:25,559
get into the one that I can jump on

5057
03:31:23,439 --> 03:31:28,120
board with we can find a way to

5058
03:31:25,559 --> 03:31:31,680
communicate that to Consumers which

5059
03:31:28,120 --> 03:31:34,520
might be as simple as naming a couple of

5060
03:31:31,680 --> 03:31:36,960
profiles in where they hit your nose

5061
03:31:34,520 --> 03:31:40,479
versus your eyes versus the back of your

5062
03:31:36,959 --> 03:31:42,438
tongue um or you know we we approach

5063
03:31:40,478 --> 03:31:44,879
them with the you know the consumption

5064
03:31:42,439 --> 03:31:46,840
perspective because we could come up

5065
03:31:44,879 --> 03:31:49,719
with more innovative

5066
03:31:46,840 --> 03:31:53,520
delivery methods um the cart really took

5067
03:31:49,719 --> 03:31:56,119
us by storm because you know we let the

5068
03:31:53,520 --> 03:31:59,079
the tobacco industry sort of infiltrate

5069
03:31:56,120 --> 03:32:03,199
you know it and it it didn't work

5070
03:31:59,079 --> 03:32:05,359
out either it was it was easy it wasn't

5071
03:32:03,199 --> 03:32:07,120
even affordable at first that's the

5072
03:32:05,359 --> 03:32:09,600
thing the original vape pens were

5073
03:32:07,120 --> 03:32:13,120
expensive I really didn't believe it was

5074
03:32:09,600 --> 03:32:15,520
going to work and I've never been more

5075
03:32:13,120 --> 03:32:17,600
wrong about anything in cannabis so I've

5076
03:32:15,520 --> 03:32:20,600
been working personally really hard on

5077
03:32:17,600 --> 03:32:22,760
infusing joints in a way that works

5078
03:32:20,600 --> 03:32:26,439
because pre-rolls are

5079
03:32:22,760 --> 03:32:28,079
gross um they don't have a shelf life

5080
03:32:26,439 --> 03:32:31,120
and the best way to improve them is to

5081
03:32:28,079 --> 03:32:33,238
fill them up with concentrate and so you

5082
03:32:31,120 --> 03:32:35,800
know if I can use the right type of

5083
03:32:33,238 --> 03:32:38,600
concentrate to insulate the flour and

5084
03:32:35,799 --> 03:32:40,438
preserve the flavor there's a chance and

5085
03:32:38,600 --> 03:32:43,159
that gives me the portability and the

5086
03:32:40,439 --> 03:32:44,639
potency that a cart could but I think

5087
03:32:43,159 --> 03:32:47,039
back to this conversation we've been

5088
03:32:44,639 --> 03:32:49,079
having all along about po potency if we

5089
03:32:47,040 --> 03:32:52,800
get away from trying to deliver the most

5090
03:32:49,079 --> 03:32:54,199
THC at a time we could make it more

5091
03:32:52,799 --> 03:32:56,000
affordable I don't know if you guys

5092
03:32:54,199 --> 03:32:58,840
remember the little ceramic things that

5093
03:32:56,000 --> 03:33:01,639
you could inject distillate into yeah

5094
03:32:58,840 --> 03:33:05,279
that wasn't the right solution but it

5095
03:33:01,639 --> 03:33:08,799
was a direction that like like why

5096
03:33:05,279 --> 03:33:11,040
didn't we deliver shatter in dab sizes

5097
03:33:08,799 --> 03:33:13,719
why did we make it in irregular sticky

5098
03:33:11,040 --> 03:33:16,960
shapes wded up in paper we're doing

5099
03:33:13,719 --> 03:33:19,478
ridiculous things sometimes for slab

5100
03:33:16,959 --> 03:33:21,599
dabs you couldn't have had slab dabs if

5101
03:33:19,478 --> 03:33:25,198
you did that even I was impressed with

5102
03:33:21,600 --> 03:33:27,199
slab dabs we we've uh so you know to

5103
03:33:25,199 --> 03:33:29,279
that end we we don't make it easy for us

5104
03:33:27,199 --> 03:33:32,239
to handle in the lab or for the consumer

5105
03:33:29,279 --> 03:33:35,120
it does require some investment but

5106
03:33:32,238 --> 03:33:37,600
technology has never been cheaper people

5107
03:33:35,120 --> 03:33:39,600
who are approaching dabs today it has

5108
03:33:37,600 --> 03:33:42,399
never been more accessible because the

5109
03:33:39,600 --> 03:33:44,559
cost for me to buy a titanium nail and

5110
03:33:42,398 --> 03:33:48,719
the blowtorch attachment for the big old

5111
03:33:44,559 --> 03:33:51,639
map gas can at Home Depot is the same as

5112
03:33:48,719 --> 03:33:55,079
what it cost me for a $200 little laser

5113
03:33:51,639 --> 03:33:58,559
device like I spent way I don't want to

5114
03:33:55,079 --> 03:34:01,359
know the amount of money I invested in

5115
03:33:58,559 --> 03:34:03,719
metal dabbing things that I dabbed out

5116
03:34:01,359 --> 03:34:05,439
of a lot of times in my life so you know

5117
03:34:03,719 --> 03:34:07,519
I think people are willing to make the

5118
03:34:05,439 --> 03:34:11,559
investment have to make the

5119
03:34:07,520 --> 03:34:14,720
ARG this is um so I forget the name of

5120
03:34:11,559 --> 03:34:17,159
the overall company but if you see like

5121
03:34:14,719 --> 03:34:19,438
it's got a laser

5122
03:34:17,159 --> 03:34:22,719
and um so you put a dab in it like you

5123
03:34:19,439 --> 03:34:24,279
would with a puff Co and it will create

5124
03:34:22,719 --> 03:34:26,198
the vapor I don't know if I can get it

5125
03:34:24,279 --> 03:34:29,800
really close but you can see who makes

5126
03:34:26,199 --> 03:34:29,800
that in the vapor laser

5127
03:34:30,120 --> 03:34:35,560
dabs but laser dabs I've got one of

5128
03:34:32,959 --> 03:34:38,198
those for herb and hash yeah see some

5129
03:34:35,559 --> 03:34:40,799
type of device like that is sort of key

5130
03:34:38,199 --> 03:34:43,600
I mean obviously I think the oil

5131
03:34:40,799 --> 03:34:46,039
Community is definitely grown like the

5132
03:34:43,600 --> 03:34:48,960
customer base from the cart like people

5133
03:34:46,040 --> 03:34:52,560
making carts has really like made oil

5134
03:34:48,959 --> 03:34:56,278
spread and become very oil spread pun

5135
03:34:52,559 --> 03:34:57,920
intended uh it's made it uh more more

5136
03:34:56,279 --> 03:34:59,600
mainstream like a lot of people have

5137
03:34:57,920 --> 03:35:02,520
tried the carts now the question was

5138
03:34:59,600 --> 03:35:05,359
from ET you know what are you guys doing

5139
03:35:02,520 --> 03:35:07,238
to sort of educate or to create your

5140
03:35:05,359 --> 03:35:10,760
customer base and if you're not liking

5141
03:35:07,238 --> 03:35:12,198
the carts I get it um it's kind of it it

5142
03:35:10,760 --> 03:35:14,040
is what it is it's definitely a way to

5143
03:35:12,199 --> 03:35:16,279
fund your company if you want to do R&amp;D

5144
03:35:14,040 --> 03:35:18,720
and find other Pathways if you can

5145
03:35:16,279 --> 03:35:21,560
Cs and make them available people are

5146
03:35:18,719 --> 03:35:23,238
always going to love them um what I was

5147
03:35:21,559 --> 03:35:25,920
going to say is though so what I did

5148
03:35:23,238 --> 03:35:27,959
though aten from from my brand in

5149
03:35:25,920 --> 03:35:29,799
regards to education I do product

5150
03:35:27,959 --> 03:35:32,358
knowledge sessions constantly with

5151
03:35:29,799 --> 03:35:34,079
stores and Bud tenders and people but

5152
03:35:32,359 --> 03:35:35,680
really before that because I'm in the

5153
03:35:34,079 --> 03:35:38,159
same boat I'm making like full melt

5154
03:35:35,680 --> 03:35:40,639
bubble six-star dry sift live hash rosin

5155
03:35:38,159 --> 03:35:44,398
these products are too strong for the

5156
03:35:40,639 --> 03:35:46,159
majority of the users and so I want to

5157
03:35:44,398 --> 03:35:48,639
really kind of know differently than how

5158
03:35:46,159 --> 03:35:50,359
I helped build this crew of water

5159
03:35:48,639 --> 03:35:52,519
extractors out in the world by just

5160
03:35:50,359 --> 03:35:55,120
selling bags to everyone before that

5161
03:35:52,520 --> 03:35:57,720
there was no water hash and so there was

5162
03:35:55,120 --> 03:36:00,000
no water hash industry uh and so it's

5163
03:35:57,719 --> 03:36:01,478
slowly built with great Growers become

5164
03:36:00,000 --> 03:36:03,559
you know finding the bags and building

5165
03:36:01,478 --> 03:36:07,278
this industry so what I did with my

5166
03:36:03,559 --> 03:36:09,238
brand bubbleman brand is I knew that you

5167
03:36:07,279 --> 03:36:11,840
know the majority of the industry in in

5168
03:36:09,238 --> 03:36:13,920
both the US and Canada are pre-rolled

5169
03:36:11,840 --> 03:36:16,398
joints that is like that's like like a

5170
03:36:13,920 --> 03:36:20,000
massive if you can pull from The

5171
03:36:16,398 --> 03:36:22,079
pre-roll Joint Group market that is like

5172
03:36:20,000 --> 03:36:24,559
the one of the biggest market shares in

5173
03:36:22,079 --> 03:36:27,639
cannabis and so I was like I want those

5174
03:36:24,559 --> 03:36:29,519
people to uh experience a dab however

5175
03:36:27,639 --> 03:36:30,760
they're not going to it's not like for

5176
03:36:29,520 --> 03:36:32,840
many reasons that have already been

5177
03:36:30,760 --> 03:36:34,520
mentioned on this panel it's just not

5178
03:36:32,840 --> 03:36:37,040
going to happen oh yeah just go buy a

5179
03:36:34,520 --> 03:36:39,800
$500 puffco and then uh yeah make sure

5180
03:36:37,040 --> 03:36:41,199
you buy the right rosin or bubble hash

5181
03:36:39,799 --> 03:36:42,519
and oh you better get like a proper

5182
03:36:41,199 --> 03:36:43,760
Dabber oh you don't have a Dabber well

5183
03:36:42,520 --> 03:36:44,880
you're going to need one you won't be

5184
03:36:43,760 --> 03:36:47,719
you won't be able to get it out of the

5185
03:36:44,879 --> 03:36:51,478
jar and suddenly they're just like

5186
03:36:47,719 --> 03:36:54,840
$118,000 in they've got a JP Toro Banger

5187
03:36:51,478 --> 03:36:56,639
and a banger bucket and all basket and

5188
03:36:54,840 --> 03:36:59,840
all of this stuff and it it's a lot of

5189
03:36:56,639 --> 03:37:03,439
stuff to have um I wanted to build a

5190
03:36:59,840 --> 03:37:06,359
bridge with a product that I could turn

5191
03:37:03,439 --> 03:37:08,559
people on who were smoking joints and

5192
03:37:06,359 --> 03:37:10,279
there was now infused joints were just

5193
03:37:08,559 --> 03:37:11,680
coming when I created this product but I

5194
03:37:10,279 --> 03:37:13,800
I created this little product called

5195
03:37:11,680 --> 03:37:16,600
hash hits and it's really like a simple

5196
03:37:13,799 --> 03:37:18,639
little little box I you know little box

5197
03:37:16,600 --> 03:37:20,600
with these little paper tubes and we use

5198
03:37:18,639 --> 03:37:22,639
ceramic bowls now but we originally had

5199
03:37:20,600 --> 03:37:25,040
stainless steel bowls and we would just

5200
03:37:22,639 --> 03:37:26,840
put like0 two of a gram of hash in there

5201
03:37:25,040 --> 03:37:28,399
and you'd get like 10 rips out of it and

5202
03:37:26,840 --> 03:37:30,040
when I was when I was first creating

5203
03:37:28,398 --> 03:37:33,358
this product like I was creating it for

5204
03:37:30,040 --> 03:37:35,760
a customer base I hadn't burned anything

5205
03:37:33,359 --> 03:37:38,840
in like over 20 years I had only

5206
03:37:35,760 --> 03:37:40,800
vaporized hash melty six-star hash for

5207
03:37:38,840 --> 03:37:42,639
like 20 years so imagine where my

5208
03:37:40,799 --> 03:37:44,238
palette is when I'm like okay I'm going

5209
03:37:42,639 --> 03:37:46,478
to try and smoke some hash so I the

5210
03:37:44,238 --> 03:37:47,760
first bit I smoked it was very I was

5211
03:37:46,478 --> 03:37:49,519
just like oh my God that was a little

5212
03:37:47,760 --> 03:37:50,960
bit much and as I got to know the

5213
03:37:49,520 --> 03:37:52,479
product I'd take it out on the mountain

5214
03:37:50,959 --> 03:37:54,198
and I'd give them away to people and I'd

5215
03:37:52,478 --> 03:37:57,238
go electric skateboarding around the

5216
03:37:54,199 --> 03:37:59,439
seaw wall and it was this it was the

5217
03:37:57,238 --> 03:38:02,879
first time in decades that I had been

5218
03:37:59,439 --> 03:38:05,439
stoned I had just been high for 20

5219
03:38:02,879 --> 03:38:09,238
[ __ ] years and I totally had turned

5220
03:38:05,439 --> 03:38:11,639
my back on the beauty of being stoned

5221
03:38:09,238 --> 03:38:13,559
and I think for me I discovered that

5222
03:38:11,639 --> 03:38:15,959
that's what I want to share with people

5223
03:38:13,559 --> 03:38:18,000
I want to show them a nice Stone

5224
03:38:15,959 --> 03:38:21,079
that doesn't come from Cannabis but is

5225
03:38:18,000 --> 03:38:23,680
from the hash and build a little bridge

5226
03:38:21,079 --> 03:38:25,639
for them to kind of come on over and see

5227
03:38:23,680 --> 03:38:28,199
well what else is over here oh you got

5228
03:38:25,639 --> 03:38:30,559
these pure hash joints and you got oh

5229
03:38:28,199 --> 03:38:32,239
you have some traditional hash and

5230
03:38:30,559 --> 03:38:33,719
what's this stuff bubble has well that's

5231
03:38:32,238 --> 03:38:36,119
the strong stuff maybe just take a

5232
03:38:33,719 --> 03:38:38,679
little bit and eventually you know just

5233
03:38:36,120 --> 03:38:41,479
like for me I didn't start with live

5234
03:38:38,680 --> 03:38:43,800
hash rosin like I started with like

5235
03:38:41,478 --> 03:38:45,438
shitty moldy weed you know from a

5236
03:38:43,799 --> 03:38:46,639
sketchy dude that I probably should

5237
03:38:45,439 --> 03:38:48,920
shouldn't have been communicating with

5238
03:38:46,639 --> 03:38:50,639
when I was in uh in uh junior high or

5239
03:38:48,920 --> 03:38:52,760
whatever so that's what I did with my

5240
03:38:50,639 --> 03:38:54,559
brand build the bridge create some

5241
03:38:52,760 --> 03:38:57,040
products that they can kind of come over

5242
03:38:54,559 --> 03:39:01,398
and visit and so I would say to anyone

5243
03:38:57,040 --> 03:39:03,279

5269
03:40:02,079 --> 03:40:07,199
to the airport going on trips vacations

5270
03:40:04,238 --> 03:40:09,639
where you can't get weed uh in in

5271
03:40:07,199 --> 03:40:11,439
between zones they're just it they're

5272
03:40:09,639 --> 03:40:14,278
they're a good thing to have now they've

5273
03:40:11,439 --> 03:40:16,120
been dog [ __ ] for years uh and I think

5274
03:40:14,279 --> 03:40:17,760
in the last like three four some

5275
03:40:16,120 --> 03:40:21,439
companies have really stepped it up and

5276
03:40:17,760 --> 03:40:23,920
like done the research on our type of

5277
03:40:21,439 --> 03:40:26,000
oils burning in the carts because

5278
03:40:23,920 --> 03:40:28,639
for I don't even know how many years it

5279
03:40:26,000 --> 03:40:30,040
was just China sending us EIG carts and

5280
03:40:28,639 --> 03:40:34,119
that we were just testing to see what

5281
03:40:30,040 --> 03:40:36,359
was best so um the fact that they have

5282
03:40:34,120 --> 03:40:38,760
no burn technology where the heat ramps

5283
03:40:36,359 --> 03:40:41,600
up on and off when you're pulling a draw

5284
03:40:38,760 --> 03:40:43,920
makes that really easy for people to not

5285
03:40:41,600 --> 03:40:46,640
be holding buttons and overb burning the

5286
03:40:43,920 --> 03:40:49,040
oil so the tech has gotten better so I

5287
03:40:46,639 --> 03:40:51,920
think that transition to people that

5288
03:40:49,040 --> 03:40:53,399
don't have dab rigs yet or you know

5289
03:40:51,920 --> 03:40:55,520
they're running around town and they

5290
03:40:53,398 --> 03:40:57,478
can't have like a whole thing with them

5291
03:40:55,520 --> 03:40:59,439
that that is like the good transition

5292
03:40:57,478 --> 03:41:03,238
for a lot of these people getting

5293
03:40:59,439 --> 03:41:05,159
into yeah absolutely you're not wrong

5294
03:41:03,238 --> 03:41:06,639
they're popular I definitely like I

5295
03:41:05,159 --> 03:41:09,520
people ask me what's your favorite

5296
03:41:06,639 --> 03:41:11,478
what's your favorite dude like if sure

5297
03:41:09,520 --> 03:41:13,800
there's your favorite but how about like

5298
03:41:11,478 --> 03:41:16,039
what are you willing not to smoke out of

5299
03:41:13,799 --> 03:41:18,398
if you need to get high and you don't

5300
03:41:16,040 --> 03:41:20,720
have any device at that point in time

5301
03:41:18,398 --> 03:41:22,719
like listen like I probably won't hit

5302
03:41:20,719 --> 03:41:25,398
the Coke can but I'm definitely making

5303
03:41:22,719 --> 03:41:27,318
an apple pipe like 100% that's no

5304
03:41:25,398 --> 03:41:30,439
problem I'll make a pipe out of out of a

5305
03:41:27,318 --> 03:41:33,198
piece of fruit all day long so there's

5306
03:41:30,439 --> 03:41:36,680
something to be said for

5307
03:41:33,199 --> 03:41:42,399
that one thing we used to do at

5308
03:41:36,680 --> 03:41:44,720
Incredibles um we um we had done um like

5309
03:41:42,398 --> 03:41:47,879
distillations like call it you know we

5310
03:41:44,719 --> 03:41:50,119
tpen distillations but um just sort of

5311
03:41:47,879 --> 03:41:53,318
like a a distillation of the volatiles

5312
03:41:50,120 --> 03:41:56,159
until um we we decided it was a good cut

5313
03:41:53,318 --> 03:41:58,079
off just sort of a single pass cut and

5314
03:41:56,158 --> 03:42:01,959
uh coming up with some pretty like

5315
03:41:58,079 --> 03:42:04,879
really pretty good oils and we would do

5316
03:42:01,959 --> 03:42:08,079
essentially like essential oil events

5317
03:42:04,879 --> 03:42:10,478
paired with like industry events where

5318
03:42:08,079 --> 03:42:12,959
we would have a room and we'd put it in

5319
03:42:10,478 --> 03:42:15,438
some Bowl we we would um spread out a

5320
03:42:12,959 --> 03:42:18,158
little little bit of our distilled tur

5321
03:42:15,439 --> 03:42:19,639
into a bowl and then you know pass that

5322
03:42:18,158 --> 03:42:21,398
around the room and give like a whole

5323
03:42:19,639 --> 03:42:22,840
education class on it and I know it's

5324
03:42:21,398 --> 03:42:26,719
not something that you can do all the

5325
03:42:22,840 --> 03:42:28,840
time but it's like a non-smoked entry

5326
03:42:26,719 --> 03:42:30,959
into it too where you don't even have to

5327
03:42:28,840 --> 03:42:33,238
like they don't even have to necessarily

5328
03:42:30,959 --> 03:42:34,759
ingest it but they can still get an

5329
03:42:33,238 --> 03:42:37,119
experience and everything and start

5330
03:42:34,760 --> 03:42:38,760
learning about it yeah it gets them

5331
03:42:37,120 --> 03:42:40,680
sometimes over a little fear that's what

5332
03:42:38,760 --> 03:42:42,600
the micro daab always did even if they

5333
03:42:40,680 --> 03:42:44,680
didn't get high they tasted it a little

5334
03:42:42,600 --> 03:42:47,520
bit and it got them over the fear of

5335
03:42:44,680 --> 03:42:49,960
like okay okay like I did it because

5336
03:42:47,520 --> 03:42:52,520
they right to be fearful it's like dude

5337
03:42:49,959 --> 03:42:54,559
I could give you a dab that would be an

5338
03:42:52,520 --> 03:42:56,479
absolutely nightmares terrible

5339
03:42:54,559 --> 03:42:59,559
experience you would not want to be here

5340
03:42:56,478 --> 03:43:01,559
or in your body for that matter and so

5341
03:42:59,559 --> 03:43:04,559
it's just best to avoid that at sort of

5342
03:43:01,559 --> 03:43:07,318
all costs so um yeah if anyone has any

5343
03:43:04,559 --> 03:43:09,359
uh answer to that question in regards to

5344
03:43:07,318 --> 03:43:11,359
you know things you're doing not just to

5345
03:43:09,359 --> 03:43:13,680
educate you know your customer base and

5346
03:43:11,359 --> 03:43:16,399
to feed your customer base but to also

5347
03:43:13,680 --> 03:43:19,000
educate new people who are enjoying like

5348
03:43:16,398 --> 03:43:21,000
pre-rolled joints right now and maybe

5349
03:43:19,000 --> 03:43:23,398
you know maybe they might have a better

5350
03:43:21,000 --> 03:43:26,318
experience if they knew about about

5351
03:43:23,398 --> 03:43:29,519
extracts go ahead Murphy yeah so one

5352
03:43:26,318 --> 03:43:32,398
thing I think that um the solvent less

5353
03:43:29,520 --> 03:43:34,840
Community has done you know really well

5354
03:43:32,398 --> 03:43:37,238
in comparison to the solvent-based

5355
03:43:34,840 --> 03:43:40,120
community and there's you know a lot of

5356
03:43:37,238 --> 03:43:42,959
reasons for it um you know and probably

5357
03:43:40,120 --> 03:43:44,840
just the uh you know the age of the

5358
03:43:42,959 --> 03:43:48,919
processes how new some of the things we

5359
03:43:44,840 --> 03:43:51,000
do in the solvent world are um is that

5360
03:43:48,920 --> 03:43:52,960
you know there is a big Detachment we've

5361
03:43:51,000 --> 03:43:56,398
talked about it a few times between what

5362
03:43:52,959 --> 03:43:59,079
happens in the lab and what happens you

5363
03:43:56,398 --> 03:44:01,478
know for the consumer and the consumer

5364
03:43:59,079 --> 03:44:04,199
doesn't really need to understand the

5365
03:44:01,478 --> 03:44:06,478
entirety of the process but I do think

5366
03:44:04,199 --> 03:44:09,920
there's a ton of value in showing your

5367
03:44:06,478 --> 03:44:12,519
lab showing the process and giving that

5368
03:44:09,920 --> 03:44:15,879
visual representation you know for

5369
03:44:12,520 --> 03:44:19,960
someone to understand the temperature of

5370
03:44:15,879 --> 03:44:22,639
decarbox or what decarbox silation is or

5371
03:44:19,959 --> 03:44:26,519
why it happens at a specific temperature

5372
03:44:22,639 --> 03:44:29,119
is unnecessary for them to still see Ros

5373
03:44:26,520 --> 03:44:31,199
and drip out of a press and look at the

5374
03:44:29,120 --> 03:44:33,840
color and smell it in the room and say

5375
03:44:31,199 --> 03:44:37,560
this is correct you know and so we can

5376
03:44:33,840 --> 03:44:39,840
give consumers that kind of level of

5377
03:44:37,559 --> 03:44:42,158
understanding if we show our facilities

5378
03:44:39,840 --> 03:44:44,079
and show our process a lot more and

5379
03:44:42,158 --> 03:44:46,920
rather than trying to describe why it's

5380
03:44:44,079 --> 03:44:48,238
better literally show up for it I come

5381
03:44:46,920 --> 03:44:50,079
to this a little more naturally because

5382
03:44:48,238 --> 03:44:52,359
I've worked so much on the equipment end

5383
03:44:50,079 --> 03:44:54,120
so I've been training people to operate

5384
03:44:52,359 --> 03:44:57,120
equipment for a long time so it's very

5385
03:44:54,120 --> 03:44:59,760
normal for me to have other people in

5386
03:44:57,120 --> 03:45:02,760
the lab with me and to be showing

5387
03:44:59,760 --> 03:45:04,478
pictures and videos of the lab but the

5388
03:45:02,760 --> 03:45:05,840
the secrecy and the intellectual

5389
03:45:04,478 --> 03:45:08,879
property of it

5390
03:45:05,840 --> 03:45:11,040
all and and the nature of operating with

5391
03:45:08,879 --> 03:45:13,318
butane and propane you know there's

5392
03:45:11,040 --> 03:45:14,800
there's a lot of business reasons why

5393
03:45:13,318 --> 03:45:17,079
people don't want a camera in the lab

5394
03:45:14,799 --> 03:45:20,198
but the marketing team could show real

5395
03:45:17,079 --> 03:45:23,039
stuff happening you know like a lot of

5396
03:45:20,199 --> 03:45:26,239
my job is lifting a jar and looking at

5397
03:45:23,040 --> 03:45:27,359
it I I do that a lot but there there's

5398
03:45:26,238 --> 03:45:29,559
better

5399
03:45:27,359 --> 03:45:31,640
content that we could have you know

5400
03:45:29,559 --> 03:45:35,278
consumers exposed to like I would love

5401
03:45:31,639 --> 03:45:38,719
for consumers to see the freezer storage

5402
03:45:35,279 --> 03:45:40,760
nicely packed and organized um and you

5403
03:45:38,719 --> 03:45:43,039
know start promoting some trends like

5404
03:45:40,760 --> 03:45:45,719
that where people show their facility

5405
03:45:43,040 --> 03:45:47,600
because you know a grow gets to show the

5406
03:45:45,719 --> 03:45:49,559
healthy plants you know someone who's

5407
03:45:47,600 --> 03:45:51,279
washing is showing this ice water is

5408
03:45:49,559 --> 03:45:54,198
showing the hash you know they get to

5409
03:45:51,279 --> 03:45:56,079
flex the visual images of it and get

5410
03:45:54,199 --> 03:45:58,960
people closer to it and I think if

5411
03:45:56,079 --> 03:46:01,238
people could feel a little bit more

5412
03:45:58,959 --> 03:46:03,119
connected to the process with that

5413
03:46:01,238 --> 03:46:06,318
information they don't even have to

5414
03:46:03,120 --> 03:46:10,000
understand it they just would have some

5415
03:46:06,318 --> 03:46:12,039
concept of why CO2 isn't butane even if

5416
03:46:10,000 --> 03:46:13,238
all they know is that it's looks

5417
03:46:12,040 --> 03:46:14,600
different when it comes out of the

5418
03:46:13,238 --> 03:46:16,039
machine because they've seen what it

5419
03:46:14,600 --> 03:46:18,199
looks like like when it comes out of the

5420
03:46:16,040 --> 03:46:21,000
machine you know there's a lot of these

5421
03:46:18,199 --> 03:46:25,158
visual cues that we all talk about and

5422
03:46:21,000 --> 03:46:27,040
know naturally that the consumer just

5423
03:46:25,158 --> 03:46:29,959
hasn't been able to see from us in the

5424
03:46:27,040 --> 03:46:32,479
same way and I think you know I do a lot

5425
03:46:29,959 --> 03:46:34,000
of that in just showing the lab which

5426
03:46:32,478 --> 03:46:35,719
goes a long way to build trust it's kind

5427
03:46:34,000 --> 03:46:39,520
of like having an open Kitchen in a

5428
03:46:35,719 --> 03:46:43,318
restaurant you know we can see what's

5429
03:46:39,520 --> 03:46:46,158
and it builds trust I love an open to no

5430
03:46:43,318 --> 03:46:48,879
Source you know open kitchen and I also

5431
03:46:46,158 --> 03:46:51,840
am terrified of an open kitchen it's a

5432
03:46:48,879 --> 03:46:53,839
good it's a good confidence to have when

5433
03:46:51,840 --> 03:46:56,120
you go to an open kitchen oh I've one

5434
03:46:53,840 --> 03:46:57,559
time in my life I was at a place that

5435
03:46:56,120 --> 03:46:59,600
had a beautiful open kitchen that I'd

5436
03:46:57,559 --> 03:47:01,600
eaten there many times and just right

5437
03:46:59,600 --> 03:47:03,439
before my food came out I saw one of the

5438
03:47:01,600 --> 03:47:05,040
people working back there do something

5439
03:47:03,439 --> 03:47:07,600
that was just not something I wanted to

5440
03:47:05,040 --> 03:47:10,239
see and it completely robbed me of my

5441
03:47:07,600 --> 03:47:11,960
appetite I couldn't eat the food and I

5442
03:47:10,238 --> 03:47:13,478
didn't really want to tell everyone else

5443
03:47:11,959 --> 03:47:15,079
at the table like oh don't eat that food

5444
03:47:13,478 --> 03:47:16,158
man like don't eat that food that guy

5445
03:47:15,079 --> 03:47:18,318
that just touched it like I'm telling

5446
03:47:16,158 --> 03:47:21,279
you don't eat that so I do love the

5447
03:47:18,318 --> 03:47:23,600
transparency it's why personally for

5448
03:47:21,279 --> 03:47:26,238
live hash Rosen when I'm buying it I

5449
03:47:23,600 --> 03:47:28,158
would love to see a small sample I'd

5450
03:47:26,238 --> 03:47:30,279
love to see a picture something I think

5451
03:47:28,158 --> 03:47:33,079
it would be great you buy a gram of live

5452
03:47:30,279 --> 03:47:35,279
hash rosin and you get like a gram of

5453
03:47:33,079 --> 03:47:38,478
the bubble that made it so you can

5454
03:47:35,279 --> 03:47:40,600
really get an idea because uh you know

5455
03:47:38,478 --> 03:47:42,799
the sensory let's see the flower it came

5456
03:47:40,600 --> 03:47:45,520
from too while we're well at that point

5457
03:47:42,799 --> 03:47:49,599
it's right you know why not be be a

5458
03:47:45,520 --> 03:47:51,040
pretty good thing for certain so that's

5459
03:47:49,600 --> 03:47:53,079
awesome everybody we had a pretty good

5460
03:47:51,040 --> 03:47:55,920
conversation here we still got about 14

5461
03:47:53,079 --> 03:47:57,680
minutes to go so you know we can kind of

5462
03:47:55,920 --> 03:47:59,520
I do want while I have you guys all here

5463
03:47:57,680 --> 03:48:02,559
as well if you guys can reply back to

5464
03:47:59,520 --> 03:48:04,640
that email with your Instagrams and

5465
03:48:02,559 --> 03:48:06,519
contact information I want to put it

5466
03:48:04,639 --> 03:48:07,799
into the description of the video

5467
03:48:06,520 --> 03:48:10,000
because there's tons of people in the

5468
03:48:07,799 --> 03:48:11,559
chat that want to reach out to to to

5469
03:48:10,000 --> 03:48:12,879
each of you so that would be really

5470
03:48:11,559 --> 03:48:14,359
wonderful if I didn't have to kind of

5471
03:48:12,879 --> 03:48:15,519
Chase you guys around and you could do

5472
03:48:14,359 --> 03:48:18,840
that

5473
03:48:15,520 --> 03:48:21,279
um otherwise yeah another 14 minutes I

5474
03:48:18,840 --> 03:48:23,398
definitely want to thank our sponsors uh

5475
03:48:21,279 --> 03:48:26,760
this is the first hash Church in 11

5476
03:48:23,398 --> 03:48:30,760
years I've said no to sponsors for 11

5477
03:48:26,760 --> 03:48:34,079
years so it's also kind of wild and neat

5478
03:48:30,760 --> 03:48:39,000
and and ironic that you know some of my

5479

friend uh just wanted to touch base a

5577
03:52:23,760 --> 03:52:28,398
little bit on like the solvents I feel

5578
03:52:25,639 --> 03:52:30,439
like we didn't cover the like uh what

5579
03:52:28,398 --> 03:52:33,278
solvent do you like to extract with for

5580
03:52:30,439 --> 03:52:35,720
example you know isobutane propane and N

5581
03:52:33,279 --> 03:52:39,439
butane all behave a little different the

5582
03:52:35,719 --> 03:52:42,760
extraction process yeah more turs some

5583
03:52:39,439 --> 03:52:44,040
feel more fat some more color and they

5584
03:52:42,760 --> 03:52:46,120
each pull a little bit of a different

5585
03:52:44,040 --> 03:52:48,640
flavor you know like from the each other

5586
03:52:46,120 --> 03:52:51,520
so just wanted to get like a some

5587
03:52:48,639 --> 03:52:54,079
feedback from everyone possible dude I

5588
03:52:51,520 --> 03:52:55,840
love this this this is going to be first

5589
03:52:54,079 --> 03:52:58,039
I'm going to let Murphy and maybe a few

5590
03:52:55,840 --> 03:53:00,719
others of you guys just give a cliffnote

5591
03:52:58,040 --> 03:53:03,239
answer but I think this will be the

5592
03:53:00,719 --> 03:53:05,920
conversation to start the next solvent

5593
03:53:03,238 --> 03:53:07,799
episode on uh what a great question

5594
03:53:05,920 --> 03:53:09,840
Jorge uh go ahead Murphy you put your

5595
03:53:07,799 --> 03:53:12,398
hand up

5596
03:53:09,840 --> 03:53:15,478
first um yeah there's there's so many

5597
03:53:12,398 --> 03:53:19,079
reasons to choose each one and it's such

5598
03:53:15,478 --> 03:53:21,079
a good question and it's one in our

5599
03:53:19,079 --> 03:53:25,760
industry specifically because it's so

5600
03:53:21,079 --> 03:53:28,199
young and new that we can all get really

5601
03:53:25,760 --> 03:53:31,040
hung up on because the first question

5602
03:53:28,199 --> 03:53:33,640
you have to ask yourself is about your

5603
03:53:31,040 --> 03:53:36,040
equipment and what it's capable of

5604
03:53:33,639 --> 03:53:40,478
because sometimes the best

5605
03:53:36,040 --> 03:53:42,760
solvent for a specific sop is not going

5606
03:53:40,478 --> 03:53:45,039
to be the best solvent for the

5607
03:53:42,760 --> 03:53:46,318
underpowered heater

5608
03:53:45,040 --> 03:53:49,640
and you

5609
03:53:46,318 --> 03:53:51,840
know low wattage Chiller that you have

5610
03:53:49,639 --> 03:53:54,439
to you know run that process sometimes

5611
03:53:51,840 --> 03:53:55,880
you have to think about you know at the

5612
03:53:54,439 --> 03:53:57,559
at the cost of the equipment you have

5613
03:53:55,879 --> 03:54:00,158
and at the cost of the scale that you

5614
03:53:57,559 --> 03:54:02,879
want to perform at you can also in the

5615
03:54:00,158 --> 03:54:04,079
way that you can choose a best solvent

5616
03:54:02,879 --> 03:54:07,599
you can

5617
03:54:04,079 --> 03:54:10,079
compromise in a really strategic way so

5618
03:54:07,600 --> 03:54:13,000
maybe you know because you have lower

5619
03:54:10,079 --> 03:54:15,840
pressure vessels you go colder and

5620
03:54:13,000 --> 03:54:17,680
longer with butane and you you know

5621
03:54:15,840 --> 03:54:20,359
change your surface area and you you

5622
03:54:17,680 --> 03:54:22,960
know you make decisions accordingly and

5623
03:54:20,359 --> 03:54:24,279
so you know as important as it is to

5624
03:54:22,959 --> 03:54:26,119
choose your solvent you really have to

5625
03:54:24,279 --> 03:54:28,279
choose your equipment with your solvent

5626
03:54:26,120 --> 03:54:31,279
in mind you know and in traditional

5627
03:54:28,279 --> 03:54:32,560
chemistry it's not you know unusual to

5628
03:54:31,279 --> 03:54:34,840
have a totally different piece of

5629
03:54:32,559 --> 03:54:37,359
glasswar if you change your solvent in

5630
03:54:34,840 --> 03:54:39,799
order for you to match an sop or you

5631
03:54:37,359 --> 03:54:41,960
change your sop to use the same

5632
03:54:39,799 --> 03:54:43,719
glassware in cannabis we sometimes try

5633
03:54:41,959 --> 03:54:45,119
to do everything with the same two

5634
03:54:43,719 --> 03:54:46,478
columns

5635
03:54:45,120 --> 03:54:49,600
and hope for the

5636
03:54:46,478 --> 03:54:52,358
best uh which is not even you know go

5637
03:54:49,600 --> 03:54:54,680
back to repeatability as you brought up

5638
03:54:52,359 --> 03:54:58,399
earlier the best solvent is the one you

5639
03:54:54,680 --> 03:55:01,318
can repeat with if you can't repeat a

5640
03:54:58,398 --> 03:55:03,358
process none of it is best and the

5641
03:55:01,318 --> 03:55:04,959
solvent is the first place to start you

5642
03:55:03,359 --> 03:55:06,399
know you mentioned earlier Indra was the

5643
03:55:04,959 --> 03:55:07,919
one of the first to bring up this gas

5644
03:55:06,398 --> 03:55:10,840
needs to be

5645
03:55:07,920 --> 03:55:12,600
clean we haven't learned that lesson and

5646
03:55:10,840 --> 03:55:15,040
we haven't tried we're using refill

5647
03:55:12,600 --> 03:55:16,520
cylinders which are designed for fuel

5648
03:55:15,040 --> 03:55:18,720
you know we need to be having direct

5649
03:55:16,520 --> 03:55:20,279
filled tanks that are stored on site you

5650
03:55:18,719 --> 03:55:22,278
know maybe buried underground if you're

5651
03:55:20,279 --> 03:55:24,560
in a tornado area or something you know

5652
03:55:22,279 --> 03:55:27,399
we need a we need an entirely different

5653
03:55:24,559 --> 03:55:29,639
process to facilitate what we want to do

5654
03:55:27,398 --> 03:55:31,278
but a lot of times we get real hung up

5655
03:55:29,639 --> 03:55:32,799
on what product we want to make what's

5656
03:55:31,279 --> 03:55:35,520
the best solvent for that and we don't

5657
03:55:32,799 --> 03:55:39,599
start with what is the best solvent for

5658
03:55:35,520 --> 03:55:41,040
the process that we're capable of um if

5659
03:55:39,600 --> 03:55:44,439
we've already bought equipment or want

5660
03:55:41,040 --> 03:55:47,120
to pursue like that that question can

5661
03:55:44,439 --> 03:55:50,279
put you in a real Circle um if you're

5662
03:55:47,120 --> 03:55:53,040
not careful and a lot of times people

5663
03:55:50,279 --> 03:55:55,199
will get bad results from a specific

5664
03:55:53,040 --> 03:55:57,479
solvent because of those ancillary

5665
03:55:55,199 --> 03:56:00,279
features and so it's it's a very

5666
03:55:57,478 --> 03:56:02,358
integrated question that you probably

5667
03:56:00,279 --> 03:56:05,399
need to ask every day every batch until

5668
03:56:02,359 --> 03:56:07,079
you have incredible repeatability it's

5669
03:56:05,398 --> 03:56:09,358
it's definitely two-dimensional you

5670
03:56:07,079 --> 03:56:12,398
definitely answered it from that sort of

5671
03:56:09,359 --> 03:56:14,840
corporate business owner perspective of

5672
03:56:12,398 --> 03:56:17,559
like well listen that's not I feel like

5673
03:56:14,840 --> 03:56:19,639
Jorge asked it more like yo what do you

5674
03:56:17,559 --> 03:56:21,318
guys like for your best solvent like for

5675
03:56:19,639 --> 03:56:23,799
your head but I don't know we'll let him

5676
03:56:21,318 --> 03:56:26,719
answer that but first uh John you had

5677
03:56:23,799 --> 03:56:29,478
your hand up first then horge uh Jorge

5678
03:56:26,719 --> 03:56:31,679
and then Yari you'll be up after that

5679
03:56:29,478 --> 03:56:33,559
and then uh we'll call it a day it's

5680
03:56:31,680 --> 03:56:36,238
okay if we go over five or 10 or 20

5681
03:56:33,559 --> 03:56:38,879
minutes so go go ahead John well yeah I

5682
03:56:36,238 --> 03:56:42,000
think definitely a good place to start

5683
03:56:38,879 --> 03:56:45,519
another episode on because we could go

5684
03:56:42,000 --> 03:56:48,840
pretty deep into the various reasons you

5685
03:56:45,520 --> 03:56:52,439
might you know Choose You Know neat

5686
03:56:48,840 --> 03:56:56,158
isobutane neat propane blends with

5687
03:56:52,439 --> 03:56:58,318
normal butane or whatever um because

5688
03:56:56,158 --> 03:56:59,719
although they're all non-polar solvent

5689
03:56:58,318 --> 03:57:03,879
and they're all

5690
03:56:59,719 --> 03:57:05,438
alkanes they pretty they do pretty

5691
03:57:03,879 --> 03:57:08,000
different things in terms of dissolving

5692
03:57:05,439 --> 03:57:11,040
different flavorant um as far as that

5693
03:57:08,000 --> 03:57:14,238
goes you know and I noticed that with

5694
03:57:11,040 --> 03:57:17,319
just straight inan certain flavors don't

5695
03:57:14,238 --> 03:57:20,478
get picked up almost at a wide range of

5696
03:57:17,318 --> 03:57:22,439
temperatures isobutane that Bond I guess

5697
03:57:20,478 --> 03:57:25,318
it's the bond angle Mark could come in

5698
03:57:22,439 --> 03:57:28,079
and explain that later you know may be

5699
03:57:25,318 --> 03:57:31,039
more capable of uh you know pulling some

5700
03:57:28,079 --> 03:57:33,000
more polar uh flavor inside of the mix

5701
03:57:31,040 --> 03:57:35,399
and everybody knows that propane does a

5702
03:57:33,000 --> 03:57:38,478
great job with you know tarping as a

5703
03:57:35,398 --> 03:57:40,719
whole there's a lot there um not to

5704
03:57:38,478 --> 03:57:42,840
mention temperature and the original

5705
03:57:40,719 --> 03:57:45,719
reason I had my hand up was just to give

5706
03:57:42,840 --> 03:57:48,238
a shout out to the solventless Community

5707
03:57:45,719 --> 03:57:51,000
because I have became a better hash

5708
03:57:48,238 --> 03:57:52,840
maker from learning the things and

5709
03:57:51,000 --> 03:57:55,079
following the solventless community as

5710
03:57:52,840 --> 03:57:56,719
they are having to look so closely at

5711
03:57:55,079 --> 03:58:00,439
all these different triome you know

5712
03:57:56,719 --> 03:58:03,519
characteristics morphology you know that

5713
03:58:00,439 --> 03:58:06,398
has educated me to be able to you know

5714
03:58:03,520 --> 03:58:09,238
select the style of extraction for a

5715
03:58:06,398 --> 03:58:11,799
given biomass and that gets into solvent

5716
03:58:09,238 --> 03:58:15,318
selection as

5717
03:58:11,799 --> 03:58:17,559
well absolutely uh Jorge I think you

5718
03:58:15,318 --> 03:58:17,559
were

5719
03:58:17,639 --> 03:58:24,639
next yeah so the question was basically

5720
03:58:21,318 --> 03:58:26,478
like Murphy got it like uh there she I

5721
03:58:24,639 --> 03:58:27,840
wanted to bring attention to that like

5722
03:58:26,478 --> 03:58:30,840
uh you know you guys use different

5723
03:58:27,840 --> 03:58:34,600
solvents for different purposes Bas on

5724
03:58:30,840 --> 03:58:37,600
the SOP for example I want to mention at

5725
03:58:34,600 --> 03:58:39,800
one time I was testing how much thca

5726
03:58:37,600 --> 03:58:43,000
each solving can be solved so I loaded

5727
03:58:39,799 --> 03:58:45,398
up a minor or you know two miners with

5728
03:58:43,000 --> 03:58:48,120
the same amount of isol and injected

5729
03:58:45,398 --> 03:58:50,278
same amount of solvent one was isobutane

5730
03:58:48,120 --> 03:58:53,319
one was and butane and heated them up to

5731
03:58:50,279 --> 03:58:56,079
the same temperature and got notice that

5732
03:58:53,318 --> 03:58:58,959
only ISO buttine can only dissolve about

5733
03:58:56,079 --> 03:59:01,079
half the amount that n buttine can so

5734
03:58:58,959 --> 03:59:04,039
that's why like your sop would I guess

5735
03:59:01,079 --> 03:59:08,398
matter for what what you're after uh to

5736
03:59:04,040 --> 03:59:10,120
extract and but in general to like what

5737
03:59:08,398 --> 03:59:13,559
you were saying is yes there is also

5738
03:59:10,120 --> 03:59:15,720
like to extract with like uh for example

5739
03:59:13,559 --> 03:59:19,639
you can get a with using a blend like

5740
03:59:15,719 --> 03:59:22,198
7030 uh being 7D uh uh

5741
03:59:19,639 --> 03:59:23,519
butane and that can bring benefits for

5742
03:59:22,199 --> 03:59:25,479
example it can help pull a lot of the

5743
03:59:23,520 --> 03:59:28,120
other compounds with the extract so you

5744
03:59:25,478 --> 03:59:30,398
have a more full profile and it can also

5745
03:59:28,120 --> 03:59:34,319
help with like recovery times because it

5746
03:59:30,398 --> 03:59:37,519
boils over a lot faster than uh

5747
03:59:34,318 --> 03:59:40,119
buttine nice very good Yi you had your

5748
03:59:37,520 --> 03:59:42,520
hand up in my personal opinion and doing

5749
03:59:40,120 --> 03:59:44,600
all the experiments with the the grow

5750
03:59:42,520 --> 03:59:46,800
and the flower and everything and butane

5751
03:59:44,600 --> 03:59:50,680
is the best solvent for weed in my

5752
03:59:46,799 --> 03:59:52,358
personal opinion um I know that they

5753
03:59:50,680 --> 03:59:54,359
explained all those other reasons if you

5754
03:59:52,359 --> 03:59:56,318
wouldn't get really like analytical with

5755
03:59:54,359 --> 04:00:00,920
it but all

5756
03:59:56,318 --> 04:00:04,559
around uh the effect the the HT that

5757
04:00:00,920 --> 04:00:08,318
comes off of it uh the thca that you

5758
04:00:04,559 --> 04:00:12,000
pull from it I personally think n butane

5759
04:00:08,318 --> 04:00:15,359
is the the way to go just my yeah I run

5760
04:00:12,000 --> 04:00:17,120
this neat I run neat normal utane mostly

5761
04:00:15,359 --> 04:00:19,318
yeah but I do Envision this like you

5762
04:00:17,120 --> 04:00:22,279
know super nitty-gritty future of like

5763
04:00:19,318 --> 04:00:24,478
oh okay this Ry has this flavor profile

5764
04:00:22,279 --> 04:00:27,079
so for this extraction I'm going to dial

5765
04:00:24,478 --> 04:00:29,158
this blend of co-solvents to make sure I

5766
04:00:27,079 --> 04:00:31,799
you know honored that bouquet but you

5767
04:00:29,158 --> 04:00:34,000
know I wish I was running living soil

5768
04:00:31,799 --> 04:00:36,438
top shelf every

5769
04:00:34,000 --> 04:00:39,799
day you gotta make it happen tella you

5770
04:00:36,439 --> 04:00:42,158
had your hand up uh yeah I also uh run

5771
04:00:39,799 --> 04:00:45,198
and butane to keep it keep it simple on

5772
04:00:42,158 --> 04:00:48,520
the recovery too to sure that like I'm

5773
04:00:45,199 --> 04:00:52,000
not having to do crazy math to try to

5774
04:00:48,520 --> 04:00:54,680
try to get um get my um my ratios back

5775
04:00:52,000 --> 04:00:56,359
to what I wanted after recovering so

5776
04:00:54,680 --> 04:00:58,318
that's part of the reason why at

5777
04:00:56,359 --> 04:01:00,840
Incredibles as a business we always kept

5778
04:00:58,318 --> 04:01:03,680
it and butane just to keep it simple so

5779
04:01:00,840 --> 04:01:05,559
we were always recovering just one gas

5780
04:01:03,680 --> 04:01:08,960
and the ratio of gas has never changed

5781
04:01:05,559 --> 04:01:11,000
in our recovery tanks and uh and just

5782
04:01:08,959 --> 04:01:12,679
sort of out of preference I guess too

5783
04:01:11,000 --> 04:01:14,920
over time probably a little bit of bias

5784
04:01:12,680 --> 04:01:16,559
in that

5785
04:01:14,920 --> 04:01:18,439
I'm just going to have to neag everybody

5786
04:01:16,559 --> 04:01:21,119
because I love propane so much you guys

5787
04:01:18,439 --> 04:01:22,800
you just have to run it such high

5788
04:01:21,120 --> 04:01:25,560
pressure if you're running low pressure

5789
04:01:22,799 --> 04:01:28,198
propane you ain't doing nothing but if

5790
04:01:25,559 --> 04:01:31,278
you're willing to blast it like really

5791
04:01:28,199 --> 04:01:34,199
blast it you can do it's it's everything

5792
04:01:31,279 --> 04:01:36,120
that CO2 should be able to do but

5793
04:01:34,199 --> 04:01:39,399
doesn't well it's actually kind of

5794
04:01:36,120 --> 04:01:41,680
similar to CO2 in some ways and a lot of

5795
04:01:39,398 --> 04:01:42,639
the chemical ways explain this yeah you

5796
04:01:41,680 --> 04:01:45,520
know it's a

5797
04:01:42,639 --> 04:01:48,478
tetrahedral um type three diens

5798
04:01:45,520 --> 04:01:50,560
structure but yeah right I like to

5799
04:01:48,478 --> 04:01:53,559
compare propane to like you know that's

5800
04:01:50,559 --> 04:01:55,639
like riding a bucking bull you know and

5801
04:01:53,559 --> 04:01:58,920
inan is like riding a a good

5802
04:01:55,639 --> 04:02:00,920
well-trained horse and um depends on

5803
04:01:58,920 --> 04:02:03,719
who's driving you know and like you're

5804
04:02:00,920 --> 04:02:05,920
saying for the business sense I think

5805
04:02:03,719 --> 04:02:08,000
inan is more popular for many reasons

5806
04:02:05,920 --> 04:02:09,398
and one of them being it's really nice

5807
04:02:08,000 --> 04:02:14,398
to

5808
04:02:09,398 --> 04:02:14,398
handle it's not propan is cheaper

5809
04:02:15,398 --> 04:02:19,439
awesome well that was an incredible

5810
04:02:17,199 --> 04:02:22,359
conversation everyone really thank you

5811
04:02:19,439 --> 04:02:24,720
for coming on today and just W in the

5812
04:02:22,359 --> 04:02:26,199
knowledge like I said first of many

5813
04:02:24,719 --> 04:02:29,278
episodes we're definitely going to go

5814
04:02:26,199 --> 04:02:33,040
deeper uh I want to hear more from both

5815
04:02:29,279 --> 04:02:34,800
Jorge and uh Adam and Murphy in regards

5816
04:02:33,040 --> 04:02:36,920
to the education that they're doing I

5817
04:02:34,799 --> 04:02:39,158
wanted to uh you know see a little bit

5818
04:02:36,920 --> 04:02:41,318
talk a little bit about the genome uh

5819
04:02:39,158 --> 04:02:43,639
project that you have going on there

5820
04:02:41,318 --> 04:02:46,959
with your education and just uh yeah I'd

5821
04:02:43,639 --> 04:02:49,000
love to you know obviously speak to all

5822
04:02:46,959 --> 04:02:52,000
of you uh again here in the very near

5823
04:02:49,000 --> 04:02:53,760
future so Dr Mark thank you so much for

5824
04:02:52,000 --> 04:02:55,639
bringing this great group of people

5825
04:02:53,760 --> 04:02:58,238
together and uh hopefully you guys had a

5826
04:02:55,639 --> 04:03:01,079
good time over there puffing bowls

5827
04:02:58,238 --> 04:03:03,920
ripping dabs what was really cool about

5828
04:03:01,079 --> 04:03:07,199
pulling this this group together is it

5829
04:03:03,920 --> 04:03:11,000
it brought back some relationships like

5830
04:03:07,199 --> 04:03:12,560
Eric and I haven't seen each other in oh

5831
04:03:11,000 --> 04:03:16,478
yeah such a long time it's so good to

5832
04:03:12,559 --> 04:03:18,559
see you good to reconnect and um you

5833
04:03:16,478 --> 04:03:20,599
know it's great to hear from some of the

5834
04:03:18,559 --> 04:03:24,478
younger folks in the room too because

5835
04:03:20,600 --> 04:03:28,120
yeah there are some OG's we we did have

5836
04:03:24,478 --> 04:03:33,278
U an invitation out the Boris at Busy B

5837
04:03:28,120 --> 04:03:35,720
and uh for Jason the emotech so you know

5838
04:03:33,279 --> 04:03:39,520
but hey we got kind bill in the room

5839
04:03:35,719 --> 04:03:41,438
here this is great yeah it's great I

5840
04:03:39,520 --> 04:03:44,000
mean this is a great community of people

5841
04:03:41,439 --> 04:03:45,920
Ryan and Max you know I love you guys we

5842
04:03:44,000 --> 04:03:48,760
did consider you know basically throwing

5843
04:03:45,920 --> 04:03:51,318
maybe an invite out to Derek but I think

5844
04:03:48,760 --> 04:03:54,478
having uh having Ryan and Telly here the

5845
04:03:51,318 --> 04:03:57,000
next next best thing and yeah Marcus

5846
04:03:54,478 --> 04:03:59,879
thank you so much for giving us this uh

5847
04:03:57,000 --> 04:04:01,719
opportunity to come together Murphy

5848
04:03:59,879 --> 04:04:03,679
you're always so impressive I could

5849
04:04:01,719 --> 04:04:07,318
always tell you that everything that you

5850
04:04:03,680 --> 04:04:09,800
say is spot-on chemical you know I mean

5851
04:04:07,318 --> 04:04:11,439
chemically correct and uh I think the

5852
04:04:09,799 --> 04:04:12,639
real difference between propane and

5853
04:04:11,439 --> 04:04:15,000
butane has nothing to do with the

5854
04:04:12,639 --> 04:04:16,799
polarity polarity is about the same it

5855
04:04:15,000 --> 04:04:19,040
has to do with the uh with the

5856
04:04:16,799 --> 04:04:21,599
thermodynamics has to do with the rate

5857
04:04:19,040 --> 04:04:23,880
rate of recovery and the fact that you

5858
04:04:21,600 --> 04:04:28,040
know it's a lot easier and quicker to

5859
04:04:23,879 --> 04:04:30,639
recover uh things like uh butane but um

5860
04:04:28,040 --> 04:04:33,199
Jorge thank you so much for sharing that

5861
04:04:30,639 --> 04:04:37,039
uh that result that result about the

5862
04:04:33,199 --> 04:04:40,520
fact that ISO uh propane uh dissolved

5863
04:04:37,040 --> 04:04:42,520
less than n propane you know you might I

5864
04:04:40,520 --> 04:04:44,359
want to mention real quick the TPS also

5865
04:04:42,520 --> 04:04:46,800
play a role there talking about just

5866
04:04:44,359 --> 04:04:50,920
clean ISO you know no no secondary

5867
04:04:46,799 --> 04:04:53,759
solvent right right but just side

5868
04:04:50,920 --> 04:04:56,478
secondary solvent yeah I mean just to be

5869
04:04:53,760 --> 04:04:58,238
able to do a side bys side comparison

5870
04:04:56,478 --> 04:04:59,920
and share that result with the world you

5871
04:04:58,238 --> 04:05:02,600
know what I envisioned as soon as you

5872
04:04:59,920 --> 04:05:04,398
said that result and Jorge I don't know

5873
04:05:02,600 --> 04:05:06,479
if you remember I came by your booth at

5874
04:05:04,398 --> 04:05:08,680
biscon and we had a really we had a

5875
04:05:06,478 --> 04:05:11,599
really nice chat that was a really

5876
04:05:08,680 --> 04:05:14,040
really great I remember you oh yeah oh

5877
04:05:11,600 --> 04:05:17,640
yeah and and I'll say the same thing I

5878
04:05:14,040 --> 04:05:20,359
said to to to uh to Murphy which is that

5879
04:05:17,639 --> 04:05:22,238
everything that you're saying is spot-on

5880
04:05:20,359 --> 04:05:24,960
correct I mean you're you're not a

5881
04:05:22,238 --> 04:05:27,520
chemist by training but you're kind of a

5882
04:05:24,959 --> 04:05:29,719
uh a a chemist by observation and that's

5883
04:05:27,520 --> 04:05:32,000
that's really great but sharing that

5884
04:05:29,719 --> 04:05:34,559
result again maybe that's a great way to

5885
04:05:32,000 --> 04:05:36,840
do a control crash you know the fact

5886
04:05:34,559 --> 04:05:38,760
that you can take advantage of different

5887
04:05:36,840 --> 04:05:40,920
solubility differences and these

5888
04:05:38,760 --> 04:05:43,120
different solvents there could be ways

5889
04:05:40,920 --> 04:05:44,840
of perhaps you know like if you wanted

5890
04:05:43,120 --> 04:05:47,040
to make like kind of like the micro

5891
04:05:44,840 --> 04:05:49,199
diamonds or if you wanted to sort of

5892
04:05:47,040 --> 04:05:51,840
speed up your process you could keep

5893
04:05:49,199 --> 04:05:54,680
that in mind that hey if we're rich in

5894
04:05:51,840 --> 04:05:57,040
in isopropane we might see a crash

5895
04:05:54,680 --> 04:05:59,760
happen sooner than later sooner than we

5896
04:05:57,040 --> 04:05:59,760
predicted

5897
04:06:01,398 --> 04:06:07,358
right Adam when we developed the uh the

5898
04:06:04,639 --> 04:06:10,039
genome crystallizer that's actually the

5899
04:06:07,359 --> 04:06:13,720
original um Insight that that drove that

5900
04:06:10,040 --> 04:06:17,399
Innovation was uh noticing that um if

5901
04:06:13,719 --> 04:06:22,119
you added cold propane um into like a

5902
04:06:17,398 --> 04:06:24,238
jar of of dissolved uh oil and oil

5903
04:06:22,120 --> 04:06:27,520
dissolved in in butane then it would

5904
04:06:24,238 --> 04:06:30,279
like immediately kind of like pop um and

5905
04:06:27,520 --> 04:06:33,439
that observation kind of just we kept at

5906
04:06:30,279 --> 04:06:35,880
that and and uh now we actually use uh

5907
04:06:33,439 --> 04:06:37,199
butane because like uh people were

5908
04:06:35,879 --> 04:06:38,920
mentioning like it's just a little bit

5909
04:06:37,199 --> 04:06:41,079
easier to control and kind of the

5910
04:06:38,920 --> 04:06:42,840
consistency and repeatability of it but

5911
04:06:41,079 --> 04:06:45,520
if there's a challenging crystallization

5912
04:06:42,840 --> 04:06:47,120
you can always add um it sounds like

5913
04:06:45,520 --> 04:06:49,600
isobutane would have a similar effect

5914
04:06:47,120 --> 04:06:52,800
but adding very cold propane into the

5915
04:06:49,600 --> 04:06:54,960
mixture um can drop the the solubility

5916
04:06:52,799 --> 04:06:56,639
and kind of like create like an instant

5917
04:06:54,959 --> 04:06:59,719
Cascade of

5918
04:06:56,639 --> 04:07:01,039
crystallization go ahead John yeah well

5919
04:06:59,719 --> 04:07:02,519
it's real interesting you know Mark

5920
04:07:01,040 --> 04:07:05,040
you're saying there's not much

5921
04:07:02,520 --> 04:07:08,640
difference in polarity between you know

5922
04:07:05,040 --> 04:07:13,120
these three light hydrocarbons uh jge

5923
04:07:08,639 --> 04:07:15,278
has shown us you know with pure thda a

5924
04:07:13,120 --> 04:07:17,239
you know clear solubility difference and

5925
04:07:15,279 --> 04:07:20,158
a lot of us have seen it between the

5926
04:07:17,238 --> 04:07:22,840
three um and then with the genome

5927
04:07:20,158 --> 04:07:25,799
crystallizer I've also wondered you know

5928
04:07:22,840 --> 04:07:27,520
is it acting as an anti-solvent or a

5929
04:07:25,799 --> 04:07:30,238
direct contact

5930
04:07:27,520 --> 04:07:32,119
refrigerant um and I think that's what's

5931
04:07:30,238 --> 04:07:33,760
keeping me involved with you know

5932
04:07:32,119 --> 04:07:35,600
playing with all these things is uh

5933
04:07:33,760 --> 04:07:37,359
there's a lot of questions to be

5934
04:07:35,600 --> 04:07:41,520
answered out here you know we know what

5935
04:07:37,359 --> 04:07:44,640
works but sometimes the how is gets into

5936
04:07:41,520 --> 04:07:44,640
the nitty-gritty

5937
04:07:46,040 --> 04:07:52,720
absolutely awesome everybody well we did

5938
04:07:48,840 --> 04:07:54,359
it we hit our 4our Mark 4 hours and six

5939
04:07:52,719 --> 04:07:55,879
minutes in fact so I'm going to

5940
04:07:54,359 --> 04:07:58,158
definitely keep I've got all of your

5941
04:07:55,879 --> 04:08:00,238
email contacts but I'd definitely love

5942
04:07:58,158 --> 04:08:01,879
for you guys to reply to the email or

5943
04:08:00,238 --> 04:08:04,279
hit me up in any way that you can

5944
04:08:01,879 --> 04:08:06,039
ideally through that email uh I'll also

5945
04:08:04,279 --> 04:08:07,680
put you in touch with anyone if there's

5946
04:08:06,040 --> 04:08:09,319
an email if there's someone you don't

5947
04:08:07,680 --> 04:08:11,318
know but you wanted to know but maybe

5948
04:08:09,318 --> 04:08:12,799
it's not their name or the email doesn't

5949
04:08:11,318 --> 04:08:14,840
really connect to them in any way you

5950

can reach out to to me uh and I'll make

5951
04:08:14,840 --> 04:08:20,238
sure to connect anyone on the panel here

5952
04:08:16,879 --> 04:08:22,318
today who wants to uh have the link uh

5953

04:08:23,879 --> 04:08:27,879
entire time we had this episode there's

5956
04:08:25,920 --> 04:08:31,398
some hardcore cannabis nerds that just

5957
04:08:27,879 --> 04:08:33,959
love to hear this stuff and uh we love

5958
04:08:31,398 --> 04:08:37,238
to talk about it so it's a it's a

5959
04:08:33,959 --> 04:08:41,318
marriage made in heaven really so is not

5960
04:08:37,238 --> 04:08:44,799
dead right pH is not dead no it's right

5961
04:08:41,318 --> 04:08:46,519
here today and hash Church episode 3 and

5962
04:08:44,799 --> 04:08:49,000
uh we'll be talking about this some more

5963
04:08:46,520 --> 04:08:51,600
in the future hopefully we'll uh make a

5964
04:08:49,000 --> 04:08:54,000
bunch of wonderful uh new Pro uh

5965
04:08:51,600 --> 04:08:55,840
programs here it's hard to plan a show

5966
04:08:54,000 --> 04:08:57,920
so I once again I got to give you props

5967
04:08:55,840 --> 04:09:00,279
Dr Mark for pulling such an Eclectic

5968
04:08:57,920 --> 04:09:02,799
wonderful group of people that actually

5969
04:09:00,279 --> 04:09:04,319
answered the emails and actually uh it's

5970
04:09:02,799 --> 04:09:06,599
hard when you're planning a show and the

5971
04:09:04,318 --> 04:09:08,359
people you're reaching out to aren't uh

5972
04:09:06,600 --> 04:09:10,199
getting back to you so hopefully next

5973
04:09:08,359 --> 04:09:12,040
week we have another doozy I'm not sure

5974
04:09:10,199 --> 04:09:13,640
exactly what it's going to be but I'm

5975
04:09:12,040 --> 04:09:16,040
sure it'll be a banger and it'll start

5976
04:09:13,639 --> 04:09:18,799
coming together here sooner than later

5977
04:09:16,040 --> 04:09:21,399
in the meantime I would say May the full

5978
04:09:18,799 --> 04:09:23,799
Mount bless your bowl sooner than later

5979
04:09:21,398 --> 04:09:25,478
and thanks everyone for the time that

5980
04:09:23,799 --> 04:09:27,158
you spent with us here today on hash

5981
04:09:25,478 --> 04:09:30,278
church this is infinite this will just

5982
04:09:27,158 --> 04:09:33,238
be up forever and ever and ever or at

5983
04:09:30,279 --> 04:09:37,119
least a long time so peace out everybody

5984
04:09:33,238 --> 04:09:37,118
we'll talk to you next time
