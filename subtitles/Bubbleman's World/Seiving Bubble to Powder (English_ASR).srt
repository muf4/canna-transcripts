1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,550
All

2
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:19,549
[Music]

3
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:26,399
right, here we go. We're

4
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:29,039
on. All right, so we've got our resin

5
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:30,799
here. Our 25 micron still sitting out in

6
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,880
the bag, which is fine. It's uh out in

7
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,399
the cold weather. We've got the towel

8
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,399
underneath and we've got the towel over

9
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:40,679
top. We've got our strainers, a little

10
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,759
one and a big one, and a variety of

11
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:46,558
spoons that we'll be able to use inside

12
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:49,920
the strainer to allow it to to fall

13
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:53,280
properly. So, I've also got um this is

14
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:56,480
helpful cardboard with all the numbers

15
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,960
written on it already. 160, 120, 90, 73,

16
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:00,398
and 45. And I have uh some other

17
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,719
cardboards here as well with more

18
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,920
numbers on them. So, it's pretty

19
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,079
important, even though you might think

20
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,760
you know what's going on, to mark down

21
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:09,760
the resins. Like I was saying to Ron

22
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,000
earlier, when he put the the 220 right

23
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,840
in the middle, if we had all of these,

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,118
you know, sure, an expert hashmaker

25
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,118
should pretty much be able I could tell

26
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:19,280
you which one the 45 is, the 73 and the

27
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:21,118
90 would be pretty easy to hone in. It

28
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,439
wouldn't be impossible, but let's just

29
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:25,920
be organized and and do this the proper

30
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:26,879
way. So, we're going to do straining

31
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,799
today. We're not going to do

32
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:31,039
microplaning. Microplaning is a process

33
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,799
where I freeze these after removing a

34
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,360
lot of the moisture, either letting it

35
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,280
wick just like this. Freeze them and

36
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:39,400
then microplane them over the cardboard.

37
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,840
We're going to do stainless uh strainer

38
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:43,680
today. And I'm going to just clean this

39
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,079
out a tiny bit cuz it's still dirty from

40
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,600
the last time I used it. Giving it a

41
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:51,039
little whack like that will literally

42
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:52,719
clean 95% of the resin out of it. That's

43
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,040
why I like the strainers. It's nice like

44
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:56,719
that. So, this is pretty high quality

45
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,560
resin. You kind of have to know with

46
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:00,078
straining how what quality of the resin

47
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,840
you're working with. If you're working

48
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:04,559
with an extremely high quality resin and

49
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,759
you press down really hard, it's bonded.

50
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,040
You're never going to push it through a

51
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,038
strainer. You might as well throw that

52
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,599
stuff in the uh in the freezer and

53
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:13,598
microplane it. So, I'm going to be um

54
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:16,039
pretty gentle. You can see there's these

55
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:20,399
patties here have now dried out a tiny

56
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:22,239
bit. Pretty much for straining, I don't

57
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,840
want them to be much drier than that. I

58
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,759
know the quality of this watermelon. I

59
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,080
know the quality of Subcool and his

60
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:30,479
strains, the TGA crew. They don't mess

61
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,599
around. Um, those guys produce Fullmelt

62
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:36,159
genetics, you know, certified by me, the

63
00:02:32,598 --> 00:02:38,479
Bubbleman. Um, yeah. So, let's let's do

64
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:40,519
this. We've got our strains here. I can

65
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:47,039
kind of lift it up a little bit for you.

66
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:50,080
220, 190, 160, 120, 90, 73, and 45. So,

67
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:53,039
we're going to take these for starters.

68
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,239
Now, the 220, it's it's nothing. It's

69
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,239
not even a product. So, I mean,

70
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,878
literally, I'll just put it up here in

71
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,239
the corner of the 160. I I won't push

72
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:02,799
that through the strainer. I don't want

73
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:05,840
that on the strainer contaminating my uh

74
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:08,800
my final product. And nor do I want uh

75
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,800
the 190. Uh they'll both be cooked into

76
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,800
metamals most likely. So, those can just

77
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,959
sit right there on top of the screen or

78
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,439
on top of the cardboard. This is the

79
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:20,878
first one I'll actually do. And I

80
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:23,598
suggest when you do this that you use a

81
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:26,280
separate strainer for your lower grades

82
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:29,759
as opposed to your higher

83
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:32,400
grades. So take that out. We're going to

84
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:35,959
take our 160. Now, place it in our

85
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:39,200
stainless strain strainer and literally

86
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:40,959
just grind it through. You know, not

87
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:42,719
grinding it harsh, but just nice and

88
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:46,560
gently. And you can can see it just

89
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:48,158
falls as powder. And uh I'll get Ron to

90
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,000
do a few of these later and I'll

91
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:52,560
actually film it closer so you can see

92
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
what I'm talking about of allowing it to

93
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:58,158
spread thin. And so as you get to the

94
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,039
end when you think that you just have

95
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:03,359
all this hash stuck in your strainer,

96
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:05,359
you just come over to the other side and

97
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,590
kind of give it a little shave and give

98
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,200
it a little

99
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:10,719
[Music]

100
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:13,679
whack and everything comes off of your

101
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:15,359
strainer. So there's our 160 done. Our

102
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,959
220 and our 190 are sitting there

103
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,040
undone. I'm going to take this strainer

104
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,879
and this spoon and put it over here

105
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,240
because it has a lower quality resin.

106
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:24,079
And because we want to be obsessive

107
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,918
about this, let's think about it. We use

108
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:28,800
cannabis for 3 months. We made variables

109
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:30,639
of choosing phenotypes, growing it under

110
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,319
extreme conditions from controlling

111
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,319
everything indoors to trying to control

112
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:35,918
bugs and powdery mildews. Maybe you're

113
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:37,439
in a greenhouse and you need to add

114
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:39,279
extra light because it's not sunny

115
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:41,199
enough and you need to There's so many

116
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,559
variables that happen along the lines

117
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,560
and then you get to the point where you

118
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,240
trim it and that's a variable and how

119
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,759
you maintain the trim and what you do

120
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,759
with the trim and taking the trim and

121
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,520
finally washing it, not leaving it in

122
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,080
the water too long, doing all the steps

123
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:56,000
properly. Getting to this point, this to

124
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:59,439
me in my opinion is the only thing that

125
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,160
the water hash maker is doing right. The

126
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:04,079
ice mixing is popcorn and anyone can do

127
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,520
it. It's it's it's water and ice is

128
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:07,359
doing the whole job for you. So, please

129
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:09,120
don't take credit for that. The grower

130
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,280
has grown great resin for you. So,

131
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,240
please don't take credit for that. What

132
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:16,799
you can take credit for is doing this

133
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:20,000
properly. Doing this process properly is

134
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:22,400
extremely important and uh you'll be

135
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
rewarded when you do. So, this 120 that

136
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:30,399
we have is huge. So, I think I'm going

137
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:34,560
to put it on the 120 and the 45. It's a

138
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:38,799
very big piece of of uh of 120. So,

139
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,800
we'll get that right into the into the

140
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:44,918
strainer. We can just put it all at

141
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:47,279
once. Nice little pile there. And then

142
00:05:44,918 --> 00:05:49,758
we'll want to move this out of the way a

143
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:52,000
little bit cuz actually I think yeah,

144
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,560
I'm going to go 120. I might even do

145
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,079
120, 45, and 73. This is so big. I might

146
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:00,079
do the whole. And you can see how it

147
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:01,439
comes out. You want it to spread thin.

148
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:03,680
You don't want it to be getting all

149
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:05,839
thick. And that's why you need a lot of

150
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,240
space for the cardboard. A lot of people

151
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:10,318
do this wrong. They clump it all up.

152
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,879
This hash needs surface area. Once it

153
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,400
has the proper surface area, the

154
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:16,839
cardboard is going to do its job, which

155
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:19,519
is to wick the moisture out of the

156
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:22,399
hash. Very important process. That's why

157
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:24,399
so many people that are that turned off

158
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:27,439
a water hash because a it was never

159
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:28,599
dried properly or b it was, you know,

160
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:30,478
made

161
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:33,199
incorrectly. Little things, little

162
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:35,240
variables like um not leaving it in the

163
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,560
water for an

164
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:39,759
hour.

165
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,038
Awesome. All right, so the card filled

166
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,840
up there. I'm not sure where I got

167
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:47,279
caught up. I was tapping the 120 micron.

168
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:49,918
We've now moved into the um 90 micron.

169
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:53,279
Beautiful. Beautiful. Nice fatty little

170
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:55,318
patty of just absolute blonde goodness.

171
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:58,478
We're going to get that out on the 90

172
00:06:55,319 --> 00:07:02,120
here. Strainer just works so good. I got

173
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:05,120
to say, like I prefer this over uh the

174
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:06,879
microplaning every every time. It's just

175
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,639
so easy. You've watched the videos of

176
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:11,360
the microplaning and the grinding of it.

177
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,960
It's just I mean I I don't do it a ton

178
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,199
so I'm not pretending to be the the you

179
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:19,478
know the expert microplaner but I

180
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:21,919
definitely definitely prefer

181
00:07:19,478 --> 00:07:23,359
this. That's just clean and easy. I

182
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:27,000
don't have a drop of resin on my

183
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:30,479
fingers. I get all the resin off of the

184
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,560
um off the strainer. Even though you can

185
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:34,000
see the there is a little bit of a

186
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,319
buildup there from someone not cleaning

187
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,120
it. You can get it all off if you

188
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,680
require it. Okay. So, get over to this

189
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,639
70 micron

190
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:48,000
here. 70 can go right into that same

191
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:48,000
one. And we'll see what we got for

192
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:56,680
70. All right. I managed to save some

193
00:07:54,079 --> 00:08:01,560
room on that.

194
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:04,240
Okay. So, we'll be able to do our

195
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,759
45 and still make room for it because

196
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,439
I'm not sure if you guys remember at the

197
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:11,520
video there, I actually put the

198
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:13,598
120 on the 45. And that's important that

199
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:17,240
I mark that down. Like, these two are

200
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:19,839
120s now. And as well that I mark this

201
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:21,759
down that uh I don't know if there's a

202
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:24,478
pen around, but I'll make sure that I do

203
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:27,439
that because I don't want my resins all

204
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:30,079
mixed up. Once again, 45. I could

205
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:31,839
guarantee tell. I can always tell when

206
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:35,038
it's the 45. It has a very particular

207
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:37,838
taste almost regardless of the strain.

208
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:37,838
It's always very

209
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:47,839
oily. All right. So, there we have

210
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:49,519
it. You can see that it's really not as

211
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,720
difficult as some people might make it

212
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:55,759
out to be. You've got

213
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:58,959
your cardboard resin, 160, 120, 90, 73,

214
00:08:55,759 --> 00:09:01,200
and 45. All beautifully spread out. This

215
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:03,119
is um easy to move in my opinion.

216
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,480
Cardboard's light. I can go now and put

217
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,320
it in the room where it's going to be

218
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,720
drying, and it's just going to stay away

219
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:11,680
from dust, debris, hair, everything. Um

220
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:14,720
we'll probably take one of the 100

221
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:16,639
micron screens, the four the framed 2x4

222
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,120
foot frames I have, and we'll flip it

223
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:21,679
over top of this so nothing can fall on

224
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,600
top of it. So, um I think that's pretty

225
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:25,759
much it. We'll catch up with you guys

226
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,759
later when this is all dried. I'll end

227
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:29,919
up getting macro photographs of it and

228
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:32,000
melt shots. But for now, I just want to

229
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:33,599
give a huge thanks to Ron for having us

230
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,519
out here. I want to get a picture just

231
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,920
to say this, you guys. If Mark was seems

232
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,440
at all fast what he's doing, he's on a

233
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:41,838
plane in the next 10 minutes. We got to

234
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,600
get him on icy roads and to an airport

235
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,680
and on a plane. So, he did that rock and

236
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,040
roll.

237
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:49,679
Cool. We'll see you guys later on

238
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:49,679
Bubbleman's
