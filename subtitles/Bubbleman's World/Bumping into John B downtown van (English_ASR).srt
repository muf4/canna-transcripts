89
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:24,720
after car you almost have to see this

90
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:26,040
one cuz it's uh what is that like a

91
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,560
ridiculous

92
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:30,520

94
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:34,000
what was that a Maserati Maserati yeah

95
00:04:32,918 --> 00:04:35,799
we were talking about how it would have

96
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,038
hurt really bad if it hit me so well

97
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:40,720
just cuz it was so low it was low you

98
00:04:38,038 --> 00:04:42,599

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,840
you know I was going to heat it up for

100
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,600

101
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:50,560
and I'm not going to grab it oh yeah

102
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,560
probably not the best

103
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:57,199

and all of the above um hash making

115
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,680
tools I would only suggest that in a

116
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:25,918
truck like this when you heat it you

117
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,120
don't point it down you point it like

118
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:31,758
this yeah so if

119
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:33,759
you well do it next time not down just

120
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,120
cuz that's how you set your wallet on

121
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:39,400
fire that time he was quite correct I

122
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:44,519
actually did torch my wallet I let um

123
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:46,758
lit not let lit up um a few 20s on the

124
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:48,279
side this a nice little chinman walking

125
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:50,680
by here he gave us the look over he gave

126
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:52,519
us the nod the okays like I understand I

127
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,000
can see that happening another young

128
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:55,038
lady coming up here with a big smile on

129
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,120
her

130
00:05:55,038 --> 00:06:02,759
face just like that's what man joh

131
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:06,680
oh that was delicious it smells so good

132
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:10,000
too that was tasty tasty it's

133
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:12,840
definitely smiling so you brought me

134
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,079
some things John yes I did maybe we

135
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:18,239
should go over some of the things you

136
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:20,478
brought well you know what um we were um

137
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,079
considering getting a new timer because

138
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:26,318
the one that uh I lent you the one my

139
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:28,399
personal one is old and uh well it's now

140
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,479
got an error and that makes sense

141
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:32,198
because it's not war anymore that means

142
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:35,560
I bought it years ago so what' you get

143
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:39,478
us here bud so we got the CG the

144
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:41,280
XGC d1e cap controller and this is going

145
00:06:39,478 --> 00:06:42,560
to be able to control your exhaust fan

146
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:44,719
so when the temperature gets too high

147
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,759
exhaust out we also have CO2 whenever

148
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,479
you want to introduce CO2 to your garden

149
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:50,400
and we also have a too late timer on

150
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:51,879
this side here as well as humps this

151
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:53,519
also controls the temperature so it's

152
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:55,839
got a temperature control for the top

153
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:58,079
and then of course it's it's quite a

154
00:06:55,839 --> 00:07:00,878
goody little unit I actually uh did have

155
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:02,959
one for myself that's great they work

156
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:04,879
very well of course zap strapping it to

157
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:06,839
the sides right here like we always do

158
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:09,319
like we showed in your last video so

159
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:12,079
that's going to go the same way um nice

160
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:15,039
little unit flame Defender above it plug

161
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:16,839
your lights in plug your exha timer no

162
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:18,439
digital just there you go if you want to

163
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:21,279
run the pump because we can put this on

164
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:22,680
a pump it runs the pumps for basically

165
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:24,519
uh a soiless system so we have

166
