12
00:00:48,659 --> 00:00:52,349
medicating to get on that plane is

13
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,030
important medicating on the plane John

14
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:56,429

thing the morning and I like to just

26
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:18,000
kind of lightly let it just like

27
00:01:15,989 --> 00:01:24,149

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:26,159
liquid amazing but you know here we are

29
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:28,590
first thing here it's a thursday morning

30
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,299
I've already been downstairs first one

31
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:33,540
there early bird gets the worm and had a

32
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:38,459
chat with Michael and Jeff good guy so

33
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:39,930

34

35
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:43,260
Jeff and Michael I met Jeff of Michael

36
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:44,549

37
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:46,618
setting up and they're really excited

38
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:48,810
and what upstairs took some pitches like

39
00:01:46,618 --> 00:01:50,640
hey you are not supposed to be up here

40
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:53,159
because I had of course my sandals on

41
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,269
and no hard hat oh really yeah so you

42
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:56,250
know what they will stretch up there

43
00:01:54,269 --> 00:02:00,560
Oona had a little morning good morning

44
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:00,560
and then astro-boy fresh-frozen dunk

45
00:02:01,909 --> 00:02:08,340
just melts away to nothing got to do

46
00:02:05,368 --> 00:02:09,810
some melt hits this this weekend i lost

47
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:11,849
my ceramic disc and that's why you

48
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,979
haven't been seeing melt hits as much i

49
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:16,169
find the poking be bowl the way it's

50
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:19,109
sort of deep and dark it's very hard to

51
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:21,509
get the lens to focus inside to show the

52
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:24,150
melt factor but I'm going to get myself

53
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:27,060
either a ceramic insert or potentially a

54
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:29,819
sapphire one of the new sapphire inserts

55
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:32,729
that details working on so wow yeah

56
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:34,199
that's not fun x one that'll be fun the

57
00:02:32,729 --> 00:02:36,359
best thing about this Dean obviously is

58
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:38,939
vaporizing it since we're in the hotel

59
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,019
vaporizing as a key thing it's very keen

60
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:42,689
you know a lot of people might think

61
00:02:40,019 --> 00:02:44,939
where it works exhaling massive clouds

62
00:02:42,689 --> 00:02:46,979
of smoke but they dissipate right away

63
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:49,229
we're not actually smoking we're not

64
00:02:46,979 --> 00:02:51,869
causing the room any smell and we're

65
00:02:49,229 --> 00:02:54,149
allowed to vaporize so that's great how

66
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:55,560
was that Astro Boy tasty name of I hit

67
00:02:54,150 --> 00:03:00,120
perfect for the morning room and the

68
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:02,789
back taste on it too right that was the

69
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,599
best part about it you know what um of

70
00:03:02,789 --> 00:03:07,329
course Martin growing is

71
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:09,489
resin that was the whole idea coming

72
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:12,100
here with our own resin of course

73
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:13,390
organically grown only a mite a lot well

74
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:14,680
thing therefore green plant nutrients

75
00:03:13,389 --> 00:03:16,419
great product that's working well many

76
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:19,060
one something that I've worked with

77
00:03:16,419 --> 00:03:20,469
every day love it but it's definitely

78
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:25,900
giving us the quality of that we're

79
00:03:20,469 --> 00:03:27,819
looking for and of course with the other

80
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:29,980

like what you would keep as your nicest

129
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,780
it's we just run all of our plans I John

130
00:05:16,189 --> 00:05:19,490
might keep some buds because he smokes

131
00:05:17,779 --> 00:05:21,888
joints every once in a while but I don't

132
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:23,960
keep any I just I have run it all I have

133
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:25,848
um I have stuff that I'm growing like

134
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:27,859
four or five years manage our i like to

135
00:05:25,848 --> 00:05:29,899
keep up keep above this I won't even

136
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:33,080
ever keep thought of anything hydro in a

137
00:05:29,899 --> 00:05:35,239
jar isn't that neat that that's sort of

138
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:38,389
like well it's like the way we got

139
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:40,189
turned on to herb it's not necessarily

140
00:05:38,389 --> 00:05:42,439
my favorite way now that the way kids

141
00:05:40,189 --> 00:05:43,759
are doing it because what I meet them

142
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:47,839
all the time and they tell me while I

143
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:49,310
got turned on to herb through dabs like

144
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:51,198
that's how they got turned on to her

145
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:53,509
back to their room experience that is

146
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,610
that they got dabs which is like you

147
00:05:53,509 --> 00:05:58,009
know we love dabs weird a band right now

148
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:59,960
I'm a lot of these people are talking

149
00:05:58,009 --> 00:06:02,449
about pho dabs of course there's some

150

fresh headies but now I've got fresh

186
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:31,908
headies dot bubbleman nice which is the

187
00:07:29,478 --> 00:07:33,408
bubble Man Facebook page okay I guess

188
00:07:31,908 --> 00:07:36,319
once you get to a certain amount of

189
00:07:33,408 --> 00:07:39,110
followers you can't get anymore and so

190
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,370
they're good ideas well it's the ideas

191
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:42,169
of what I see people doing is they

192
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:43,848
create a page for themselves which you

193
00:07:42,168 --> 00:07:45,680
can of course get as many likes as you

194
00:07:43,848 --> 00:07:49,699
want and I guess liking a page is the

195
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,900
equivalent of following a person I don't

196
00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:53,360
know if you like a page now you're

197
00:07:50,899 --> 00:07:55,579
following that feed I'm new to Facebook

198
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,229
only in the last year so I didn't really

199
00:07:55,579 --> 00:07:59,000
know exactly how it worked and it

200
00:07:57,228 --> 00:08:01,689
doesn't really work like any other

201
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:09,879
website now I've been on there since

202
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:12,879
2007 I've just used up for basically

203
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:12,879
active

204
00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:24,840
alrighty closed awesome with that nice

205
00:08:19,968 --> 00:08:26,668
tasty three super distinct flavors you

206
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:30,089
know starting it out with the super

207
00:08:26,668 --> 00:08:31,709
couchy khush very deep tasting plus the

208
00:08:30,089 --> 00:08:34,139
Medi coach has something else in there

209
00:08:31,709 --> 00:08:35,939
I'm not sure what it was because John

210
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:38,879
was given the seeds that produce those

211
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:41,490
that strain we don't know what it is but

212
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:45,059
there's something else in that kush just

213
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:47,909
a little different the astro boy holy

214
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:50,369
[ __ ] I mean the hit of it was such a

215
00:08:47,909 --> 00:08:52,259
strong aftertaste and so flavorful and

216
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:54,509
then to be able to smell the fresh

217
00:08:52,259 --> 00:08:56,549
nugget in the jar like while I can taste

218
00:08:54,509 --> 00:08:59,759
it in my mouth that was a pleasurable

219
00:08:56,549 --> 00:09:01,439
experience and then yeah the my little

220
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:03,689
pony would i come what I've called the

221
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,730
desert hash almost since the first rip I

222
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:10,290
ever took of it not to mean that it's

223
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:12,899
not um strong it's just not heavy it's

224
00:09:10,289 --> 00:09:16,110
that nice yeah I love it for morning I

225
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:19,440
love it during the day I love it all day

226
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:21,750
I mean it's it's what we do it's what we

227
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,339
do it's what we do so we're going to get

228
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:25,350
out into the world out there we're gonna

229
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:27,630
go see some people bump into some some

230
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:29,129
wild people and do some fun things I'm

231
00:09:27,629 --> 00:09:30,990
not sure exactly what but I have an idea

232
00:09:29,129 --> 00:09:32,458
that it'll be adventurous we're in

233
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:34,560
yourself a group first we're gonna go

234
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:37,219
set up a booth first so we'll see you

235
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:37,219
guys in a little bit

236
00:09:41,049 --> 00:09:43,079
Oh
