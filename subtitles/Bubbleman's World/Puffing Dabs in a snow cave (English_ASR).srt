47
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:19,919
mad cold and snappy

48
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:22,879
yeah as expected I'm gonna have to

49
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:22,878
kind of gently

50
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,800
gently convince it to come out of the

51
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,840
oh yeah I did a pretty good job there

52
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,739
nice little derb here we'll hold the

53
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,360
light in

54
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:35,360
so you can actually see the derb

55
00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:41,539
we're going down buddy oh that's it this

56
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,539
piece came off

57
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:45,318
something's going on eh

58
00:03:49,378 --> 00:03:55,979
all right perfect we've got two derbs

59
00:03:53,219 --> 00:03:57,840
stoked to be having derbs in your igloo

60
00:03:55,979 --> 00:04:01,439
I'm glad you're here to be

61
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:04,140
sharing some more dabs in a new Igloo

62
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:06,299
new location it's wonderful so we'll

63
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:08,579
drop that into the Magna Carta

64
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:12,540
close that

65
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:14,340
and then it's as simple as one two

66
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:16,500
that'll cycle through the temperature so

67
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:19,798
it's at 160 right now and it's climbing

68
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:22,259
189 to 12 220 230 it'll get up to like

69
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:24,779
450 and then the one on the right side

70
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:26,039
yeah we'll turn on the timer yeah I was

71
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:28,198
gonna say the timer on that cool yeah

72
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,520
this looks really cool in the igloo here

73
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:31,139
I'm not gonna lie

74
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:34,698
I usually give it a couple seconds to be

75
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:34,699
at temperature before I start ripping

76
00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:53,959
oh my God is that good

77
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,780
yeah

78
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,919
that smells really nice candy still

79
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:03,959
learning The Sweet Spot you know not to

80
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:06,060
pull too hard

81
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:08,418
to make sure I keep keep it going for at

82
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,418
least a minute

83
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:17,418
it does taste like candy

84
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,300
smell

85
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:26,639
I don't do enough Igloo rips in life

86
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:27,959
so this feels great

87
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,560
Whistler

88
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:30,560

90
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,639
that's how small that was yeah the stool

91
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:47,459
whoa it looked bigger over there yeah no

92
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,079

93
00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:50,399
my like backpack

94
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:53,959

to cleanliness it up

98
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:10,019
cleanliness is Next to Godliness as

99
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:12,300
Skunk Man Sam would say there we go

100
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:14,879
keeping it fresh well I notice you keep

101
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:18,680
a very clean Igloo yeah as I tried to

102
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:18,680
maintain the best of the abilities

103
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,579
let's do a little Airbnb

104
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:28,739
to make sure it's clean for the next

105
00:06:26,579 --> 00:06:33,500
tenants coming in did you crush an

106
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:33,500
Airbnb up here the igloo Airbnb

107
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:39,780
I can't even imagine

108
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:43,038
you'd be crushing it

109
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:43,038
got a permit for it

110
00:06:48,538 --> 00:06:52,740
it's almost like a little bit of snow

111
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:54,779
dropped in it uh

112
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:57,538
yeah I could hear it crackling like

113
00:06:54,779 --> 00:06:59,758
water oh I gotcha

114
00:06:57,538 --> 00:07:02,038
time to put in more hash

115
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,840
and one to it give it the old one too

116
00:07:02,038 --> 00:07:05,759
there's a little hole in there you can

117
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:08,038
carb too and it's a weird Sweet Spot

118
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,699
yeah once it vibrates yeah it'll be

119
00:07:08,038 --> 00:07:10,699
ready to go again

120
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,360
oh yeah you're doing it you're doing it

121
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:24,680

this is just so cool dude

124
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,099
a whole other room over there

125
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:50,159
it's like a slow sipping

126
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:52,379
more than a blast ripping although that

127
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,840
was a pretty good rip

128
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:57,060
I got a nicer from that why was that

129
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:58,318
ever tasty

130
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,959
oh yeah it's still on the palate

131
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,759
strawberry banana from DNA genetics all

132
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:04,500
new flavors coming in courtesy of

133
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:07,439
concentrated X

134

00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:10,978
metal bubble wow there it's not rosin

136

137
00:08:10,978 --> 00:08:13,279
dude

138
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:21,300
loose temperature now but you can hit

139
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:23,478
the button twice again to get it up to

140
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,478
town

141
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:31,039
yep that was it

142
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,038
that was it

143
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:38,759
you guys could get a better idea of just

144
00:08:36,778 --> 00:08:42,200
how ridiculous this is because it is

145
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:42,200
absolutely ridiculous

146
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:50,179
okay

147
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:59,359
wow dabs in the igloo

148
00:09:00,179 --> 00:09:05,599
dude as if you have a giant pillar in

149
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,600
your [ __ ] igloo

150
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:13,500
psychological support

151
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:15,600
yes exactly it helps certain people have

152
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:17,580
okay let's talk about that certain

153
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,278
people right away have a thought that

154
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:23,700
this thing is going to collapse

155
00:09:20,278 --> 00:09:25,519
do you I don't feel that at all no but

156
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:28,500
teach their own with their fears

157
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:30,060
psychologically with being in a confined

158
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,440
space I can understand how some people

159
00:09:30,059 --> 00:09:32,699
would feel yeah yeah they don't want to

160
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,200
be travel zone they don't want to be

161
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,300
trapped I get it but it's like do you

162
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,820
feel trapped no because I spent all my

163
00:09:36,299 --> 00:09:40,319
time digging it too

164
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:42,600
it's structure to have integrity to

165
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,000
support and yeah yeah it's just like

166
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:48,060
once all this solidifies it's like it's

167
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,379
bulletproof yeah for real

168
00:09:48,059 --> 00:09:53,000
all right well we're gonna head outside

169
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:53,000
after a couple more dabs

170
00:09:53,339 --> 00:10:05,840
spots

171
