2
00:00:20,518 --> 00:00:24,640
hey guys welcome to Bubble man's world

3
00:00:22,839 --> 00:00:26,678
uh I'm here today with a new product

4
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,880
from denil that's actually a new old

5
00:00:26,678 --> 00:00:31,559
product um these guys sent me one of

6
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:35,479
these it's got to 6 months to a year ago

7
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:38,519
and it was one of my favorite uh nails

8
00:00:35,479 --> 00:00:40,479
or you know dab tools if you will that

9
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,320
I've ever hit and I think it has a lot

10
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:44,799
to do with the fact uh first of all what

11
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:48,039
I'm talking about is the Deep uh or not

12
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:50,718
the Deep the dog dish the dogghouse dish

13
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:52,280
so this is the dogghouse dish here I'll

14
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,359
give you guys a little closeup on it so

15
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:57,439
you can kind of get an idea that's

16
00:00:54,359 --> 00:01:01,120
that's what she looks like fits a 20

17
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:03,079
mil coil and it's at a 45Â° angle this

18
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:06,920
time last time it went all the way down

19
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:09,400
it was about like a 180 uh so it sits at

20
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,439
a different angle in the pipe which is

21
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:15,040
totally okay no problem and I'll show

22
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:18,199
you it also came with a cool little

23
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,799
pickaxe little beagle was having a bad

24
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,040
day apparently that day and he decided

25
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:24,880
he would make a a pickaxe and the

26
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:26,719
pickaxe of course is the Dabber and the

27
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:27,759
carb it goes right in there and carbs

28
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:30,280
that

29
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:33,239
up so today I've got a few p pieces on

30
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:34,759
the table uh I've got my Dil all set up

31
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:38,759
I believe it's about

32
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:42,000
266 de right now and so that's as simple

33
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:44,478
as that let's go for an egg hit

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,159
first let that drop down nice at the

35
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:51,200
angle you can see it's just the side

36
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:53,079
opens perfectly for a real nice hit now

37
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,399
the reason I think that this unit is so

38
00:01:53,078 --> 00:01:56,118
nice and why it hits a little bit

39
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,399
differently from most everything else is

40
00:01:56,118 --> 00:02:03,519
everything else I've hit from

41
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:05,320
denail is open the whole top is open or

42
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:07,560
you know almost always the whole top

43
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:09,159
yeah I've got this hooked up to my fab

44
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,479
egg and basically I just wanted to take

45
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:13,120
you guys through a little rip uh I've

46
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:15,598
got three different rips here I've got

47
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,200
some really nice Dry St from d420 K this

48
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:20,079
is the last of the last that I found

49
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:21,759
from a gift he gave me ages ago took

50
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,680
some macro photographs of this and it

51
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:27,598
just looks surreal the way it pressed

52
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:30,560
out in the parchment paper uh I've got

53
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:34,518
some really nice bubble hash here

54
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:36,840
um the flavor on the dry sift is OG Kush

55
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:40,280
uh the flavor on the bubble hash lo and

56
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,479
behold is OG cush um I'm taking one tiny

57
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,439
little dab of

58
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:46,560
Horatio's uh LH and I can't tell you

59
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:48,479
what the strain is uh with this

60
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,878
particular batch but I've just got a

61
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:52,639
tiny tiny little bit but I thought it

62
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:55,840
would be cool if we hit some dry sift

63
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:57,958
some bubble hash uh and some L all

64
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,680
through the deep dish or sorry the dog

65
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:02,598
housee D also also has another Bowl

66
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,239
called the the deep dish and that's

67
00:03:02,598 --> 00:03:06,158
that's a completely different uh unit

68
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,640
it's open at the top it's not completely

69
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:09,560
sealed with a little hole in the side so

70
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:10,878
uh this is the one we're going to be

71
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,039
going through today and I'm just going

72
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:16,239
to let this get heated up a tiny little

73
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:18,798
bit it's probably good to go uh oh my

74
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,959
little picket got my little picket in my

75
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:24,000
pocket here my little

76
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:28,120
Dabber so let's start we hit that little

77
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,878
bit of L for starters out of the um Fab

78
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:33,879
egg thanks Curtis of high integrity

79
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:35,598
glass art and uh yeah this is pretty

80
00:03:33,878 --> 00:03:37,318
interesting you can kind of turn that at

81
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:42,318
an angle if you want to hit it real nice

82
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:42,318
and just here we go dog

83
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:01,079
housing all

84
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,519
right

85
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:07,280
very tasty nice small rip of the

86
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:09,039
lho um always always a pleasure uh

87
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,120
hitting that uh this is the distillate

88
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:15,318
of Horatio so it's really smooth and and

89
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:17,478
it's just uh fully activated uh I can't

90
00:04:15,318 --> 00:04:20,639
say enough about it it's definitely a

91
00:04:17,478 --> 00:04:23,319
real true medicine uh in regards to

92
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,759
cannabis uh next up we've got uh the

93
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:28,279
bubble has and the dry sift I think I'm

94
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:30,680
going to hit the bubs first and hit the

95
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:33,959
dry sift last the dry just looks so so

96
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:36,918
darn nice such a nice little

97
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:39,478
treat see what we can get here this is

98
00:04:36,918 --> 00:04:41,038
just gumming up in the sun here try to

99
00:04:39,478 --> 00:04:43,758
get a nice

100
00:04:41,038 --> 00:04:45,759
substantial substantial uh hit here I've

101
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,319
got wasps Landing all over me if I look

102
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,840
like I'm doing a dance every once in a

103
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:52,319
while it's because wasps are actually

104
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:53,799
all over the place uh this summer

105
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:56,519
they've really uh yellow jackets have

106
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,840
popped everywhere I've killed probably

107
00:04:56,519 --> 00:05:03,000
10 in the last 5 minutes of filming this

108
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:05,679
episode and I see C3 uh already back for

109
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,079
for more so I might have to pause the

110
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,759
video and go smack some wasp ass around

111
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:11,879
but hopefully not hopefully I leave them

112
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,800
be they leave me be that's pretty much

113
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:16,000
easy

114
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,000
enough all

115
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:23,079
right second rip this time a little bit

116
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:26,519
more substantial some bubble hash in the

117
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:26,519
in the dog house let's do

118
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:31,478
it

119
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:52,319
the

120
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:54,198
flavor in the dogghouse is just there's

121
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:56,840
something going on with the preservation

122
00:05:54,199 --> 00:06:00,038
of the hit uh the way that the Heat

123
00:05:56,839 --> 00:06:02,239
Can't burst off up and out you put the

124
00:06:00,038 --> 00:06:04,318
hit in and you literally have it sealed

125
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,478
uh immediately I'm sure it's more

126
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,039
attuned to hitting with a carb cap where

127
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:09,800
you put your dab on your carb cap and

128
00:06:08,038 --> 00:06:12,560
then you drop it onto that nail whether

129
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:14,439
it be quartz or titanium and you get

130
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,560
this really nice sort of different type

131
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:19,038
of

132
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:22,079
hit uh based on not allowing that

133
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:25,000
initial thrust of heat and and reaction

134
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:26,399
to explode out of the top so I think

135
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,720
there's more to it than just catching

136
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:30,679
the smoke or the vapor there's also

137
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,919
having that contain and of course that's

138
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:35,319
why we love carb caps this to me just

139
00:06:32,918 --> 00:06:37,519
seems like you know a brilliant design

140
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:40,800
because it's basically it's a carb cap

141
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:42,598
and a Dabber in one and it's a unique

142
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,038
function uh that's a little bit

143
00:06:42,598 --> 00:06:47,199
different from most of the nails like I

144
00:06:44,038 --> 00:06:49,839
say with that full open straight up and

145
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,280
out the way things want to go when they

146
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:55,318
react on a hot

147
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:57,719
nail so I guess uh we'll do one more rip

148
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:59,080
here be nice if this just didn't roll

149
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:02,400
I'm going to take this and put it in the

150
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:06,120
torque us one of the nice things about

151
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:07,959
uh the doghouse dish is that it's really

152
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:11,240
easy to transfer almost as easy to

153
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:13,439
transfer as um a drop down it doesn't

154
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:17,960
get hot you can pull it out pretty

155
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:19,598
easily and uh yeah goes back in pretty

156
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:22,839
nice

157
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:24,680
so and as you can see it can be

158
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:28,439
left-handed or right-handed depending on

159
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:30,478
how far you turn the the piece so let's

160
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:31,879
uh

161
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:33,399
see if we can't get some of this dry

162
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:35,759
sift in

163
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:39,079
there this dry sift is huge I'm going to

164
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,080
really have to shove it into the

165
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:04,319
hole

166
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:04,318
yep that's the

167
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:09,959
one like absolute

168
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:09,959
candy

169
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:26,279
wow another thing that I really love

170
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,240
about the dogghouse is when I put a big

171
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:31,318
rip through it like

172
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:35,200
that it just it the preservation is like

173
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:36,839
times 10 I can't even tell you the taste

174
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:41,719
of how candied

175
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:47,279
out that that was there was definitely I

176
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:49,000
would say a little bit of the uh diesel

177
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:52,159
uh the not the East Coast hour diesel

178
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,360
but the New York City Diesel this s sort

179
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:54,360
of

180
00:08:54,839 --> 00:09:02,160
oranges almost candy esque mix with um

181
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:04,679
D's OG Kush and you know what I mean

182
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:06,799
honestly I found the bowl that he gave

183
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:09,519
me 11 different kinds in and 11

184
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:11,479
different flap so I guessed it was OG

185
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,799
Kush it tasted substantially like OG

186
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:15,440
Kush but uh you know hitting it through

187
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:17,319
