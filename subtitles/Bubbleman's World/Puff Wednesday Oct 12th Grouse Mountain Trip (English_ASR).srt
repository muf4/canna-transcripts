00:01:27,078 --> 00:01:30,039
today we were thinking about all the

37
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:31,280
different things we could do and we

38
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,960
thought we were going to we were going

39
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,239

private and small like the one in uh

43
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:45,559
Squamish so we're finger crossed going

44
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,040
to get the gondola by ourselves if not

45
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,478
we'll go up to the top of the mountain

46
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,359

00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:59,240
today yeah it's a beautiful day it's

51
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:00,640
probably the best day to take a look at

52
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:03,000
Vancouver from or you guys are about

53
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,399
ready to see yeah I'm telling you but in

54
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,640
the meantime why don't we have a sash

55
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,000
dude let's start puff puff Wednesday off

56
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,199
with uh with a sash it's what happens

57
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,159
when you're at home you carry the

58
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:13,919
propane torch you carry the propane

59
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:16,759
torch yeah John's not messing around

60
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:19,039
with the with the torch here today it's

61
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:19,039
like the

62
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,120
clink all right so we got a little bit

63
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:28,519
of Ros in here that I made a couple of

64
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:32,519
days ago on my

65
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:32,519
sasquash and with got the Jamaican

66
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:38,399
tpin and I got the timer ready perfect

67
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,319
it's important that when you do this

68
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,200
that you time and we talked about this

69
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:44,079
for that perfect flavor for that perpect

70
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:45,919
PP you got to do it if you're going to

71
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,239
be you know first you want to find out

72
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:50,639
what the perfect time for your nail is

73
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,640
because quartz and titanium and ceramic

74
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:55,318
and Sapphire all have different times

75
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:57,878
that you want to wait in particular um

76
00:02:55,318 --> 00:03:00,560
the ceramic it takes an enormous amount

77
00:02:57,878 --> 00:03:01,799
of time almost twice the amount of time

78
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,799
uh than these quartz ones that's

79
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,239
probably good she's orange all right

80
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:07,760
color blind going to give you a little

81
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,560
dip are you dipping me I'm going to give

82
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:12,759
you a little dip in the sour diesel and

83
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:14,439
these are these are some of the crd TPS

84
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:15,560
from Jamaica our company in Jamaica

85
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:17,359
people are wondering what's going on

86
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:20,400
with your company guys well we're

87
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:23,560

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,200

89
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,519

91
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,920

92
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,000

00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:35,039
Indies so there are things happening

94

with crd we may not talk about it a lot

95
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:38,719
but we've gotten to the point with it

96
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:42,120
where we really want to do more than

you're trying to get your Tarpin off of

128

00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:04,240
to be quite on the same level as taking

137
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:30,160
of my um most epic FES of a bong you

138
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,600

integrity and Darren was there and

141
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:41,199

Mothership and you know what it didn't

143
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,439
surprise me to be honest cuz when I

145
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:48,519
all the che glass and you had a variety

146
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:51,120
of different things I had a feeling that

147
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:53,279
once you guys saw the mothership I mean

00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:42,199
the best combination of the sour diesel

167
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:45,800
and rosin that I that was exceptional

168
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:49,240
it's did you do Sour Diesel do the

169
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:52,478
Jamaican Sour Diesel is Jamaican Sour

170
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:55,879
Diesel white cookies and Crown Royal all

171
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:59,800
cultivars that we processed in

172
00:06:55,879 --> 00:07:02,080
Jamaica but the rosin mixture of the two

173
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,319
that made for a really nice hit and you

174
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:04,800
know what some of the turps that I've

175
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:07,720
tried in the past and from those

176
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:10,240
sungrown ones in Jamaica that's those

177
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:12,639
are got to the the flavor is kind of

178
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:15,038
more it's um all I'll say is this from

179
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:18,199
the smells they have a more subtle smell

180
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:20,759
than Kush cleaner Cherry AK-47 um

181
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:24,400
Karma's [ __ ] mojito these are

182
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:26,598
very strong grab you immediately and and

183
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:28,679
you're just like wo these turs have a

184
00:07:26,598 --> 00:07:31,560
lesser smell but I got to say that that

185
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:33,319
was one of the best best flavor rips

186
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:36,639
that I've had from the Jamaican tarping

187
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:39,319
since I've been uh hitting them that was

188
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:42,400
exceptional ex Wednesday that's what we

189
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:43,439
did so why don't we do one more each I

190
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:45,560
don't know if you want to try the white

191
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:46,918
cookies or the Crown Royal well you know

192
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:50,038
what I'm to the white cookies I'm not

193
00:07:46,918 --> 00:07:51,000
much of a Crown Royal guy I hear you

194
00:07:50,038 --> 00:07:55,519

195
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,360
sand I hear you so but the white cookies

196
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:58,680
we're going deep on the white cookies

197
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,400
though I just di I don't know why I'm

198
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:04,000
not like heating up the thing

199
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:05,679
here but yeah um I went back and you're

200
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,319
talking about Flav and the Epic glass

201
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,158
and stuff like that it really changed

202
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:11,598
everything for him man like the guy's

collecting back in the day but uh it's

207
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,840
taking on a whole new meaning these days

208
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:23,119
I think it's about collecting you know I

209
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:25,119
think it's about getting that proper

210

bomb that hits nicely that's why this is

211

perfect for me oh yeah well for you I

212
00:08:26,918 --> 00:08:30,959
mean Flav's a collector yes he's well

213
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:33,000

00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,399
three local mountains you have Cyprus

for the grous grind which is about a 50

238
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:28,519
to 55 minute you know cruise up to the

239
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:31,000
top of the mountain we're not going to

240
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:33,120
do that today some people it takes hours

241
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,799
some people do it in 40 minutes but

242
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,519
we're going to get on the Gondola pay

I'm I'm looking forward to this one

247
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:49,958
today give it a

248
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:51,759
clean we're kind of well past cleaning

249
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:54,679
this particular one I just sort of told

250
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:57,159
John the importance of uh cleaning the

251
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:58,958
quartz on these swings cuz they are they

252
00:09:57,159 --> 00:10:01,199
are quite expensive hundreds of dollars

253
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:03,559
3 $400 or $500 sometimes depending on

254
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,959
the color of the dial and whatnot and so

255
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:06,559
it's good if you can just hit the low

256
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:08,278
temp abbs and then I've of course

257
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:10,199
brought my uh Q-tips I bring them

258
00:10:08,278 --> 00:10:11,799
everywhere I go just given that quick

259
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,200
little wipe makes all the difference in

260
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:14,359
the world and you can really tell the

261
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,839
difference when you're hanging out with

262
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:18,919
someone who's OCD about their quartz

263
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:20,440
swing which I know after today Johnny B

264
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:22,240
is going to be I know we can pull this

265
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:24,360
out cuz I pulled this quartz piece out

266
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,039
so that can be replaced yes it's just

267
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,480
this dial they're all different colors

268
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:30,319
they have gold silver purple green and I

269
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,320
think I should get a red one generally

270
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,440
yeah generally for the swing and the

271
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,120
dial you're looking at about 400

272
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:38,760
bucks and then it you know two 200 more

273
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,759
for the bucket a couple hundred more for

274
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:42,879
the they're definitely not cheap well

275
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:45,039
you know what for me um I definitely uh

276
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:47,399
got grab another hit light me really

277
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:48,838
really good it was uh all business and

278
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:50,919
we were talking about different ways of

279
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:54,519
advertising and stuff like that so I

280
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:56,439
mean expenses were put to where it's

281
00:10:54,519 --> 00:11:00,078
very useful you don't have to justify

282

290
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:18,879
up to the next level we'll take it up to

291
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:21,879
gross with us maybe we can use my how

292
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:23,799
was the white cookies it was that was

293
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:26,559
the the first one was nice and smooth

294
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:28,879
and really like nice yep that one there

295
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:30,159
it was like oh it hit it hit me hard

296
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:31,360
interesting that you'd say that because

297
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:34,559
the white

298
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:37,759
cookies hit Remo so hard on the video we

299
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:39,719
did uh a couple like about a week ago we

300
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:42,838
had smoked 10 in a row but during the

301
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:44,720
white cookies he was coughing he was and

302
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:48,160
that goes to show you it has nothing to

303
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:50,120
do with any residual Foods or chemicals

304
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:53,039
or anything because that was the same

305
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:54,759
rosin that we hit through each one you

306
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:56,679
just hit the same rosin but by merely

307
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:58,480
changing the tarping profile you can

308
00:11:56,679 --> 00:11:59,799
really change how much it makes you

309
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,600
cough

310
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:05,278
know we're looking

311
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:07,480
red all right well we got a bit of a

312
00:12:05,278 --> 00:12:09,799
ride ahead of us

313
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:12,399
110% what you that like 45 minutes to

314
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:16,559
get to gross oh yeah but uh that

315
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:18,759
definitely the tpin in that

316
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:20,559
particular as you can see it hit me hard

317
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:22,838
the white cookies I love when you get

318
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:24,958
super baked and you I'm just like the

319
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:27,800
the last time we went to the gondola on

320
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:29,319
in Squamish you said an amazing thing

321
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:30,799
and I yeah it was amazing it's like you

322
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:33,560
know uh you got to get the bubble in

323
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:34,958
there when the bubble uh has the mouth

324
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:37,359
like it was just a really unique thing

325
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:38,799
and then I I kind of I wrote some text

326
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,039
over that I was like did you guys catch

327
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:44,078
that and then I I rewound it and played

328
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:48,480
it again but I personally appreciate

329
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:51,198
those profound profound Johnny B moments

330
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,240
it's got all dude well I get to hang out

331
00:12:51,198 --> 00:12:55,719
with you I get to hang out with this guy

332
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:58,759
and you guys that's like so like now the

333
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:02,480
sun's going to break this sun in my eyes

334
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:05,360
can't wait you know the

335
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,720
view and I think the next tur because we

336
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,440
did the white

337
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,399
cookies we have one last one to do it's

338
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,800
the uh the Crown Royal but I think we'll

339
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:15,078
take it to grous I think we'll take that

340
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:17,719
one and hit it on grous I think we'll

341
00:13:15,078 --> 00:13:20,679
hit that talk about maybe in the

342
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:24,079
G if we're

343
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:26,719
lucky we always have pens I have both

344
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:29,519
pens I have my herb pen and my

345
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,000
concentrate pen so I'm sure I have

346
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,959
several that we've destroyed over the

347
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,958
years let's waste not another minute my

348
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:38,198
friend let's take our friends and head

349
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:38,198
to the

350
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:43,679
mountain all right guys so we have

351
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:45,879
arrived here at gr Mountain there's a

352
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:48,359
ton of people tourists from all over the

353
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:49,958
place so it's doubtful that we're going

354
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,600
to get a Gondola because they're so big

355
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:52,958
and you have to wait 15 minutes we'll

356
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,480
probably we'll be able to film a little

357
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:55,599
bit of it for you maybe the whole thing

358
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,039
for that matter but we're not going to

359
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,240
be able to have a big session so we

360
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:03,120
figured we would get the grasshopper and

361
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:05,360
the alicron going here while we uh you

362
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,959
know have our little pre- session before

363
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,320
we get on the G pretty much a great idea

364
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:10,919
so you said you brought some herb I did

365
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:14,079
all right so little chamber if you want

366
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:14,958
to jam some little powder in there that

367
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:16,599
looks

368
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:20,479
nice

369
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,480
see you want to Medan it

370
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:26,759
up how convenient that is just it's got

371
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:29,679
some convenience to it I just don't use

372
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:32,440
herb very often you know ni smell yeah

373
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:37,439
that smells good so let's go with

374
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:40,320
the B of A pack in these things work

375
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:43,360
great keeps it fresh I won't pack this

376
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:47,399
too too tight the big one might be a

377
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:51,000
little too big for might have to change

378
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:53,078
that I think it'll use the fingers a

379
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,480
little bit no that's definitely not a

380
00:14:53,078 --> 00:14:56,679
flow no that one's not for flowers that

381
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,320
would be the one that I'm going to Puff

382
00:14:56,679 --> 00:15:01,039
on that's the one I'm actually going to

383
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,879
be puffing on really they at least we

384
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:06,360
both have agreed to something we both

385
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:08,759
want to Puff on the one with the the the

386
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:11,919
Sal B we love the

387
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:14,720
herb we're not dishing the herb I'm

388
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:16,759
dissing it a little bit I'm not I'm just

389
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,800
everybody just disappeared too this gra

390
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:21,440
grasshopper is easy you click it once

391
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:22,159
you get the you get the red lights on

392
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,120
the

393
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:27,679
bottom and they'll go Blue in a few

394
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:30,399
seconds boom on that doesn't take very

395
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:33,479
long mine funny enough hey I'm just

396
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,480
going top

397
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:48,439
my think about maybe doing some logs

398
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:49,879
actually doing some log we got going for

399
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,720
you it's nice and slow you know slow

400
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:53,318
pulls at first and then the slower you

401
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:56,319
pull just like this the bigger rips you

402
00:15:53,318 --> 00:15:56,318
get

403
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:04,519
that was a pretty good

404
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:06,958
one this definitely a vapor tasty so

405
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:09,519
tasty the weed was a little bit moist so

406
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:11,078
once it gets that moisture out of it

407
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:15,198
might have clicked off on

408
00:16:11,078 --> 00:16:17,599
you good sure it's always

409
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:20,240
on I was looking at they were getting

410
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,319

419
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:44,399
thing

420
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,399

421
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,639
good were you not getting rips off this

422
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:58,318
I just got a huge rip off this I know I

423
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,318
actually got it going for

424
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:01,958
see what happened I was just stepping

425
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,839
out of the light over here it's 6 Ines

426
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:06,359
out you can't see me so I had to like

427
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:10,038
come over here for a second

428
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:12,279
but as the sun is moving you can hear

429
00:17:10,038 --> 00:17:14,519
they're working on the TR right now

430
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:18,399
let's pack these up okay get on that

431
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:21,959
mountain top Gondola and take these guys

432
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,959
up see you guys in a

433
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:31,440
bit all right Johnny B all right yep

434
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:33,558
Gross Mountain Gross Mountain here we go

435
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,200
trip up to the top for those of you who

436
00:17:33,558 --> 00:17:37,960
have been here before you'll notice that

437
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:40,080
normally we operate on the big red one

438
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,400
and the little blue one uh for the month

439
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:43,519
cuz they're doing maintenance over on

440
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:45,880
the redge um so it's a little bit

441
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:47,879
different coming down I'd recommend that

442
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:50,000
as soon as you get up to the top you

443
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,760
make your way over to gift services and

444
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,960
schedule an appointment time to come

445
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:56,558
down um cuz that'll save you from having

446
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:58,319
to wait um cuz this one runs a little

447
00:17:56,558 --> 00:18:00,440
bit slower and it's smaller it will mean

448
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:01,879
that there are laes coming back down so

449
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:04,120
if you've got a rough idea of when you

450
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,520
want to come down go to get Services as

451
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:09,839
soon as you

452
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:10,750
can the kind of real cloudy like I say I

453
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:15,669
