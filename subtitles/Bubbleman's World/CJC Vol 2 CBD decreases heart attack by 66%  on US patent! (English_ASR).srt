morning this is cannabis Journal club

7
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:24,599
and we'd like to thank God for this

8
00:00:22,278 --> 00:00:27,000
opportunity for us

9

to

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,879
provide super important information that

11
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:34,679
could save people's lives in your own

12
00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:36,399
family so without further Ado we're

13
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:38,159
going to go straight

14
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:42,920
to

15
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:47,078
uh our work so we're reviewing

16
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:48,840
cannabis scientific articles and US

17
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:52,439
patents regarding cannabis and the

18
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:57,079
endocannabinoid signaling system and the

19
00:00:52,439 --> 00:01:00,518
ne our next subject is uh this super

20
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:04,439
important uh patent that

21
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:06,478
we would like you to search out and

22
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:07,279
print out yourself and read it yourself

23
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:09,478
and

24
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,519
determine uh

25
00:01:09,478 --> 00:01:15,599
whether this could help you in your life

26
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:19,239
so this is not medical advice I am a

27
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:21,239
doctor but I'm not your doctor and we're

28
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:24,239
giving you information that your doctor

29
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:26,599
probably doesn't know and so you can

30
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:29,519
take these patents and show them to your

31
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:31,759
doctor and he will be shocked and

32
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:35,199
embarassed embarrassed that the medical

33
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:40,000
schools didn't teach him about this so

34
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:42,200
today we're reviewing a US patent and

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,759
it's called therapeutic uses of

36
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:47,079
cannabidiol compounds and it's US patent

37
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,000
number

38
00:01:47,078 --> 00:01:51,959
20110 slash

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,680
one excuse me

40
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:58,639
sl01

41
00:01:53,680 --> 00:02:01,560
58973 A1 and it was in June 24th 2010

42
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,560
again so that's 201

43
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,560
10158

44
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:12,640
97381 and here

45
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,959
is here is this patent and that there's

46
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:17,919
the name I don't know if you can read

47
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:20,759
that or not but and here's the patent

48
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:25,399
number and I showed it as well I shared

49
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:29,120
it on the screen so yeah and

50
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:31,879
um one of Dr Allen's dictums is never

51
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,080
believe any anything the government says

52
00:02:31,878 --> 00:02:36,239
so even government patents are under

53
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,319
question but they are The Keeper of the

54
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:41,840
truth because you can't lie and get a

55
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:43,598
patent number so we want you to download

56
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,280
these these patents yourself and

57
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:50,280
determine if this has any application in

58
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:53,400
your life and so

59
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:56,840
um the most important part about this

60
00:02:53,400 --> 00:03:00,400
patn was it it proves that it decreases

61
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:02,878
the size of a heart attack by 66%

62
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:06,439
now people can review this article and

63
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:09,399
they can claim well maybe it's not 66%

64
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:14,239
maybe it's 60% or some other

65
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:17,239
number and then criticize how they did

66
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:21,439
this study but what you can't argue with

67
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:23,560
is your eyes and so in this pattern they

68
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:26,158
have these strange

69
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,878
photographs I can share it you don't

70
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:30,120
have to show it I'll share it let me

71
00:03:27,878 --> 00:03:33,359
share it on the screen there you go it's

72
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:39,799
got the uh no CBD treated with CBD go

73
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:42,879
ahead so this is proof positive that

74
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:45,920
cannabis decreases the size of a heart

75
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:48,479
attack and your eyes can tell

76
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:52,399
you uh when you look at this Photograph

77
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:54,598
the white area is dead heart tissue that

78
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:58,680
doesn't take up dye and therefore it's

79
00:03:54,598 --> 00:04:01,158
white and the live heart muscle takes up

80
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,480
the dye and it's covered is colored in

81
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:06,479
black and so you can see the difference

82
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:10,000
in these two hearts the one on the top

83
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:12,359
is one that's not protected with CBD and

84
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,120
the one on the bottom is one that's

85
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:18,160
protected with CBD and what they did was

86
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:21,239
they took animals and they gave them CBD

87
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,560
um and they liated the front side artery

88
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:26,638
of their heart the L left anterior

89
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:30,000
desending artery and it's it's a real

90
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:32,199
super important artery and when they cut

91
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,680
the blood supply to this artery causes a

92
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:36,240
heart attack and they sectioned the

93
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:39,519
animals after the heart attack and

94
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:42,160
determined that if they had CBD it

95
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:47,279
decreased the size of a a heart attack

96
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:49,360
and this was also uh verified by enzymes

97
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:54,119
the uh people that the the animals that

98
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:57,639
didn't have uh CBD had higher cardiac

99
00:04:54,120 --> 00:05:01,918
enzymes indicating a more massive heart

100
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:05,000
attack and so this patent proves several

101
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:08,719
things it proves actually that it

102
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:13,038
decreases AOS scerotic plaque by about

103
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:15,960
50% and changes your blood it lipid

104
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:20,038
profile it improves your blood lipid

105
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:22,680
profiles and so I'm sure no if you're an

106
00:05:20,038 --> 00:05:26,038
cannabis activist not one of your

107
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:29,079
activist friends have ever told you this

108
00:05:26,038 --> 00:05:31,038
no doctor ever told you this and so now

109
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:35,159
you have information that your doctor

110
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:39,360
does not have and it and CBD decreases

111
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:44,120
the uh incidence of plaque formation by

112
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:46,240
50% and uh it says here that CBD

113
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:49,240
provides a novel safe and effective

114
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:52,319
treatment for various cardiovascular

115
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:54,439
considerations with fewer side effects

116
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:57,400
than traditional therapies so this works

117
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:59,319
better than anything we have currently

118
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:02,318
they used to treat heart attacks with

119
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:05,680
with steroids but it was found that the

120
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:08,160
steroids interfered with uh the healing

121
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:12,240
process so they've abandoned using

122
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:14,720
steroids for this but it's a complete

123
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:19,120
sin that there's not

124
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:23,160
been human trials in this

125
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:25,478
uh because 50% reduction inside of a

126
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:27,840
heart 66% reduction in size of a heart

127
00:06:25,478 --> 00:06:30,279
attack is the difference between life

128
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:32,279
and death and so

129
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:35,399
you could learn from this and save

130
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:37,399
people's lives in your own family and so

131
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:40,399
that's why we're doing this and we hope

132
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:42,000
that uh we can get people to help us

133
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:48,198
spread this

134
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:51,279
news um in this patent it uh it

135
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:53,478
mentions that

136
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:56,559
CBD might be

137
00:06:53,478 --> 00:07:01,439
incorporated in coronary

138
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:04,680
stance to prevent in instant restenosis

139
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:06,319
or failure of the coronary stance with

140
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:10,918
CBD

141
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:13,199
so uh now human Studies have not been

142
00:07:10,918 --> 00:07:15,959
been done on this and and you wouldn't

143
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:18,520
want somebody's heart to be sectioned

144
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:21,279
after a heart attack just to prove this

145
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:25,240
so more animal studies need to be done

146
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:28,719
and clinical studies proving uh cbd's

147
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:31,280
efficacy in strokes and heart attacks

148
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,840
our last

149
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:36,478
uh article that we reviewed was

150
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:39,038
cannaboid uh cannaboids as antioxidants

151
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:42,639
and neuroprotectants and

152
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:45,560
that uh patent proves that it decreases

153
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:47,800
the size of a stroke by 50% but this

154
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:50,360
patent proves it decreases the size of a

155
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,800
heart attack by

156
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:55,960
66% there so there's a

157
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:58,158
commonality CBD helps in both strokes

158
00:07:55,959 --> 00:08:00,839
and heart attacks and and probably a

159
00:07:58,158 --> 00:08:05,680
bunch of other diseases

160
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:09,638
that are not even known yet so uh we

161
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:13,519
want you to print this out and learn for

162
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:16,800
yourself and teach your family members

163
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:20,318
and your doctors and anybody you know

164
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:24,240
about this amazing evidence that

165
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:27,000
cannabis cannabis compounds does provide

166
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,680
medical utility and which means it

167
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,679
should not be schedule one which means

168
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:36,599
no medical utility and not safe under

169
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:40,718
doctor supervision so that

170
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:44,720
photo should have ended the drug war

171
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:47,680
because it proves that at least one

172
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:51,680
compound CBD and there's proof that CBD

173
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:55,039
and THC both provide this kind of

174
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:56,919
medical efficacy and it's not because of

175
00:08:55,039 --> 00:09:00,919
either one of these compounds binding

176
00:08:56,919 --> 00:09:03,958
onto the CB1 receptor it's due to other

177
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:06,639
mechanisms other than locking onto the

178
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:10,278
CB1 receptor

179
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:12,439
so um right the patent the patent

180
00:09:10,278 --> 00:09:14,439
suggests that cbd's cardioprotective

181
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:16,240
effects may be mediated through several

182
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:19,079
mechanisms so you

183
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:21,399
mentioned uh its ability to treat heart

184
00:09:19,078 --> 00:09:22,679
scars uh and part of the broader

185
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:24,839
potential for treating various

186
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:28,199
cardiovascular conditions and you also

187
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:30,320
included uh the Improvement of blood

188
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,278
lipid profiles

189
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,680
um can you mention a little bit more of

190
00:09:32,278 --> 00:09:37,838
some of the um mechanisms that CBD can

191
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:40,359
offer cardioprotective effects like its

192
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:44,880
anti-inflammatory interaction with

193
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:47,399
adenos Etc well all of this is not

194
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:49,958
delineated perfectly because basically

195
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:52,679
it's illegal to study anything about

196
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:55,278
cannabis because as a doctor you can't

197
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:57,039
give cannabis to a patient it's illegal

198
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:59,919
and so they don't allow any medical

199
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:04,319
studies because of this and

200
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:07,838
so we need medical studies and maybe one

201
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:11,240
person that's watching this can show

202
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:15,640
this photograph of the difference in

203
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:20,399
heart attacks to their doctor or to A

204
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:22,039
legislature and and prove that CBD this

205
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:25,399
this is not just

206
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:28,039
a a crazy story about cannabis working

207
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:30,919
this is proof but government proof that

208
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:33,639
cannabis has Medical utility and so we

209
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:35,799
want other people to learn about this

210
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:38,799
and other patterns we're going to

211
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:38,799
review

212
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:47,838
and uh we

213
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:52,919
want God's help we want ja over evil

214
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:56,360
live it yes we do over evil live it I

215
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:58,799
love it so unlike THC CBD does not bind

216
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:00,560
significantly to CB1 and CB2 receptors

217
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:02,278
which avoid voids the psychotropic

218
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:05,039
effects while still providing

219
00:11:02,278 --> 00:11:06,838
therapeutic benefits I can see patients

220
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:09,000
having an appreciation for that

221
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:11,839
especially with all the propaganda about

222
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,639
cannabis I've seen a lot of people who

223
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:16,560
are interested in using cannabis

224
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:18,399
medically be terrified to use cannabis

225
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:21,838
medicinally from the Decades of

226
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:23,559
propaganda that they've been fed uh so

227
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,680
this is all part of kind of breaking

228
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:28,879
through that um the patent proposes uh

229
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:30,319
using CBD to prepare pharmaceutical

230
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:32,639
composition positions for treating and

231
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,399
preventing heart scars for improving

232
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:38,639
blood plasma lipid profiles uh for

233
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:41,278
reducing atherosclerosis plaque load and

234
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:43,360
enhancing overall cardiac function so

235
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:47,078
it's a pretty incredible patent it

236
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:49,399
really does all go down to that photo uh

237
00:11:47,078 --> 00:11:53,799
that we showed earlier with the uh

238
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:56,600
Hearts uh tissue scarring with out CBD

239
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:57,958
versus the scarring with CBD you don't

240
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,278
have to be a doctor to look at the

241
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:02,518
picture and see that it's an absolutely

242
00:12:00,278 --> 00:12:06,320
mindbending difference yeah it's

243
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:08,879
profoundly different so um yeah very

244
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,879
exciting um we will be it's the

245
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:11,958
difference between life and death of

246
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:14,879
your

247
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:18,359
grandma right it's so profound we can't

248
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:21,278
really explain how profound it is to be

249
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:25,959
able to reduce a heart attack even by

250
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:28,399
50% 40% 30% let alone 60 plus perc

251
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:30,919
that's getting into a very high range

252
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:33,320
almost 70% % that they mentioned in this

253
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:36,319
uh in this uh

254
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:38,519
patent very interesting anything else Dr

255
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:41,879
Allen well

256
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:44,519
uh we need help in this we're trying to

257
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:47,958
spread this scientific knowledge you can

258
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:52,440
help us in this and if you want to join

259
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:55,679
our army and if you have special skills

260
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:58,199
that can help us with audiovisual stuff

261
00:12:55,679 --> 00:13:02,759
we would like your input and maybe you

262
00:12:58,198 --> 00:13:04,399
can help us in spreading this super

263
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:08,480
important

264
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:11,159
uh information and you know I wasn't

265
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,159
always an activist I was a heart surgeon

266
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:15,519
and I've saved hundreds of people's

267
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:19,159
lives doing cardiac

268
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:21,600
surgery and I knew about this these

269
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:24,519
patents years ago but it couldn't speak

270
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,879
to it speak about it to any

271
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:31,000
colleagues uh because it would affect my

272
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:31,000
income and so

273
00:13:32,198 --> 00:13:37,159
uh we're trying to I I knew this

274
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:40,159
information but couldn't even talk about

275
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:43,559
it and and that's part of the

276
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:45,679
propaganda and if you and and now I know

277
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:48,919
when I look on the internet now for

278
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:54,239
these same patents that I've had in my

279
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:56,078
in my possession for for 10 or 15 years

280
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:59,120
and now they're hard to find on the

281
00:13:56,078 --> 00:14:01,958
internet Because the Internet is trying

282
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:04,078
to there's groups of people that are

283
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:06,319
collecting scientific articles on

284
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:08,439
cannabis and patents and stuff and

285
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:12,000
they're actually hiding it on the

286
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:15,680
internet and the fact that you've never

287
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,958
heard of this is proof positive that

288
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:20,198
that the drug war is affecting the

289
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:23,399
knowledge of medical utility because

290
00:14:20,198 --> 00:14:25,799
that goes against schedule one and they

291
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:30,320
they're trying to keep it cannabis

292
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:33,679
illegal for for the rest of their lives

293
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,639
and so that's an evil purpose and jaw

294
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:37,638
over

295
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:40,399
evil jaw over evil I was telling Dr

296
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:42,919
Allen about ja over evil recently my

297
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,919
friends from Jamaica the gentleman Joe

298
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:48,039
who passed away at a young age from a

299
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:50,240
brain aneurism uh interestingly enough

300
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:53,198
and all the younger artists kabaka

301
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:56,360
pyramid and and chronics and this whole

302
00:14:53,198 --> 00:14:58,359
group of of artists that were under Joe

303
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:03,079
they all sort of paid homage to him

304
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:05,320
through the J o e j over evil and so

305
00:15:03,078 --> 00:15:07,958
whenever we say J over evil that is what

306
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:10,879
that means uh appreciate your time as

307
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:14,439
always Dr Allen we're happy to continue

308
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:15,639
to pump these uh episodes out and uh

309
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,839
thank you for the people who have
