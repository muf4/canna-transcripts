1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,630
hello can you hear me yes we can hear

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:14,120
you mumbling and everything no that was

3
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:14,120
me mumbling Sam

4
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:22,439
howdy Todd howdy brother and hey welcome

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,839
welcome guys we were just hearing a

6
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:27,629
little bit about the karma cup been

7
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:30,329
happening in Canada a little competition

8
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:32,368
and Sara was just telling us how there

9
00:00:30,329 --> 00:00:39,710
was a hundred entries and she's giving

10
00:00:32,368 --> 00:00:39,710
them two weeks to judge yes yes we are

11
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:44,969
hearing about so much of this in the

12
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:46,859
news these days especially in Colorado

13
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:50,039
and and around Denver that they're

14
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:52,229
finding pesticides particularly in

15
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:54,960
concentrate because again if it's on the

16
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:56,909
plant and it's going to be concentrated

17
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,850
it'll be in concentrated form and to

18
00:00:56,909 --> 00:01:03,829
concentrate and certainly like some of

19
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:07,769
these products might be safe for use

20
00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:09,599
with food products were it's going to be

21
00:01:07,769 --> 00:01:12,539
washed off but if the cannabis is never

22
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:14,669
washed and if it's just concentrated and

23
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:18,689
god only knows what happens at nail

24
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:20,969
temperature to some of these some of

25
00:01:18,688 --> 00:01:22,649
these things like Eagle I'm absolutely

26
00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:24,959
convinced that is going to thermally

27
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:27,439
degrade and give off cyanide that I

28
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:29,429
don't think that that's a known

29
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:31,349
phenomena and I think that these are

30
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:33,740
things that we really have to concern

31
00:01:31,349 --> 00:01:36,509
ourselves with in the industry because

32
00:01:33,739 --> 00:01:39,719
what I was asking her stuff what I was

33
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:42,540
asking you more was policy on pesticide

34
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:45,629
use as opposed to pesticide testing

35
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:47,820
because um I guess the notion is is that

36
00:01:45,629 --> 00:01:49,349
they've always been used now that we're

37
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:55,769
testing for them we're finding them

38
00:01:49,349 --> 00:01:58,109
figure well if they're your grower and

39
00:01:55,769 --> 00:01:59,849
there's a where you them and reject them

40
00:01:58,109 --> 00:02:02,218
because you can actually have a science

41
00:01:59,849 --> 00:02:05,339
to prove it that's your best asset just

42
00:02:02,218 --> 00:02:08,008
to sit back and say hmm yeah let's let's

43
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,899
kind of hope no like I said you really

44
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:13,169
have to put up the money you have to

45
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:15,810
research you have to actually

46
00:02:13,169 --> 00:02:17,729
you know really push your laboratory to

47
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:20,069
really get up to those standards because

48
00:02:17,729 --> 00:02:22,109
most laboratories out there only doing

49
00:02:20,068 --> 00:02:24,689
the THC testing and the biggest problem

50
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:26,700
that we have is you know we're dealing

51
00:02:24,689 --> 00:02:30,079
in an agricultural state so we have to

52
00:02:26,699 --> 00:02:33,269
deal with out all kinds of situations so

53
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,400
it's all about making sure that that

54
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:37,140
spectral analysis available to your

55
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:42,769
laboratory and that your laboratory is

56
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:46,379
actually going to go there so Roz

57
00:02:42,769 --> 00:02:50,640
absolutely huge issue that Etienne mark

58
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:53,039
hi everybody um in California especially

59
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:56,488
but anywhere where cannabis is being

60
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:59,759
over produced it 80 unmarked either of

61
00:02:56,489 --> 00:03:01,620
you have data showing different

62
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:03,629
pesticide levels and samples not

63
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:06,539
interested in the name of the I'm the

64
00:03:03,629 --> 00:03:08,849
guy who submitted the sample or what the

65
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:11,280
variety was there anything else just be

66
00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:13,769
interested in seeing the occurrence in

67
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,830
levels of different pesticides and

68
00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:18,359
samples that we collected anywhere

69
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:19,890
I can get some of those for you and I'll

70
00:03:18,359 --> 00:03:21,120
bring them next week - sure sure I can

71
00:03:19,889 --> 00:03:23,669
show you or if you'd like I can email

72
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,980
you some yeah I was just on the Denver

73
00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:30,869
Post article by Richard Baca that

74
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:32,729
described Mahatma extracts that had to

75
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:35,969
be pulled off the shelves after they

76
00:03:32,729 --> 00:03:38,729
found out after they were already out on

77
00:03:35,969 --> 00:03:42,469
the shelves that they had unacceptable

78
00:03:38,729 --> 00:03:46,229
levels of I think different pesticides

79
00:03:42,469 --> 00:03:48,030
mm-hmm so III know I mean I know that

80
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:50,819
there's a list of forbidden ones and

81
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:52,859
certainly I think you can use integrated

82
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:55,560
pest management in a way that you're not

83
00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:58,260
actually buying these harmful chemicals

84
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:02,479
to your flowers that can be felony right

85
00:03:58,259 --> 00:04:04,530
absolutely and basically the

86
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:07,500
agricultural chemicals that are approved

87
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:10,709
for integrated pest management are not

88
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:12,780
harmful to the beneficials in and fairly

89
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:15,750
lightweight in general but certainly not

90
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:18,959
armful to mammals that the big issue to

91
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:22,079
me is that at least in the state of

92
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:25,050
California you have no control

93
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,810
whatsoever you have advice from the

94
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:30,000
state government of

95
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:33,660
farmers normal farmers through Farm

96
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,189
Bureau's and through farm and feed shops

97
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:37,050
and places where they give you advice

98
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:39,418
and they ask you what you're going to

99
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:40,978
use it for and they if you use it for

100
00:04:39,418 --> 00:04:43,168
the wrong thing they suggest that you

101
00:04:40,978 --> 00:04:45,538
not do it it's fairly informal it's not

102
00:04:43,168 --> 00:04:49,129
really a police state in California

103
00:04:45,538 --> 00:04:54,598
about pesticides but they come with some

104
00:04:49,129 --> 00:04:58,848
horse sense normally that the the grow

105
00:04:54,598 --> 00:05:01,829
room supply shops are run like

106
00:04:58,848 --> 00:05:04,110
mom-and-pop pet stores you know there's

107
00:05:01,829 --> 00:05:07,889
there's nobody telling them what to do

108
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:09,660
they they get illicitly packaged avid

109
00:05:07,889 --> 00:05:11,879
and flora might and all these things

110
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:13,860
that we tell you in the Netherlands you

111
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:15,810
can't buy these without a spray permit

112
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:17,430
you can't store about it without lock

113
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:18,329
and key these things are deadly

114
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:21,240
poisonous

115
00:05:18,329 --> 00:05:25,709
you know when they tested the coffee

116
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:27,509
shops here did see four percent and

117
00:05:25,709 --> 00:05:29,008
pesticides of fungicides

118
00:05:27,509 --> 00:05:36,620
yeah even here in the Netherlands you

119
00:05:29,009 --> 00:05:36,620
can you hear that yeah that's why the

120
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:44,399
cultural University and found that these

121
00:05:41,098 --> 00:05:45,689
guys were not testing so that's why it

122
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:47,370
was a natural step for us to actually

123
00:05:45,689 --> 00:05:49,529
reach out and grab them and bring them

124
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:52,139
into the discussion because they already

125
00:05:49,529 --> 00:05:53,908
had the spectral analysis so if anybody

126
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:56,038
is thinking about doing this I highly

127
00:05:53,908 --> 00:05:57,810
recommend in your local state to reach

128
00:05:56,038 --> 00:06:00,149
out to your agricultural university

129
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:02,129
because they usually have a lot of that

130
00:06:00,149 --> 00:06:06,060
information or have access or would know

131
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:08,699
who would yeah Mike correct rub that

132
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:10,348
that should be it it's it's a state

133
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:12,930
issue rather than federal one as far as

134
00:06:10,348 --> 00:06:14,279
I understand and what we need to be of

135
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:16,978
course of self-policing

136
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:18,359
well I want to be not too rude and say

137
00:06:16,978 --> 00:06:20,459
that I think it's happening everywhere

138
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,590
cannabis is being grown commercially I

139
00:06:20,459 --> 00:06:24,779
think everybody that starts investing

140
00:06:22,589 --> 00:06:26,579
money into equipment and time and plants

141
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:29,218
and then start seeing bugs and problems

142
00:06:26,579 --> 00:06:31,620
they almost what are they supposed to do

143
00:06:29,218 --> 00:06:33,418
you know this is the problem we have it

144
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:35,399
we don't have good policing in our own

145
00:06:33,418 --> 00:06:37,139
industry and we see this happening

146
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:39,299
everywhere I don't think it's a

147
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:41,879
California thing or a No

148
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:43,079
okay I always speak about California

149
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:44,399
because that's where I'm from and that's

150
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:49,289
where I visit the most but you're

151
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:50,669
absolutely right and it's it's it's

152
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:51,270
something we need to take care of

153
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:54,150
ourselves

154
00:06:51,269 --> 00:06:56,069
and we the more and more we grow it's a

155
00:06:54,149 --> 00:06:57,810
self fulfilling problem the more and

156
00:06:56,069 --> 00:07:00,719
more you grow the lower and lower the

157
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:03,509
price lower and lower the price the less

158
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,130
you could afford to toss a crop back in

159
00:07:03,509 --> 00:07:07,349
the good old days when it was 4,000 a

160
00:07:05,129 --> 00:07:08,639
pound and you got a crop that went bad

161
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:10,980
and you're always selling it to your

162
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:13,409
buddies you pitched it in the trash

163
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:15,629
now you dry it and we make the HMO out

164
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:18,770
of it after you've sprayed it because

165
00:07:15,629 --> 00:07:18,769
you were afraid to lose it

166
00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:24,089
but let me throw this out just to be

167
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:26,899
devil's advocate we've had a quasi legal

168
00:07:24,089 --> 00:07:30,329
market in Amsterdam for 30 years since

169
00:07:26,899 --> 00:07:31,739
8485 really going back even for other

170
00:07:30,329 --> 00:07:33,569
books since the mid eighties coffee

171
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:36,240
shops have been spilling out the front

172
00:07:33,569 --> 00:07:39,120
door attacks and it has the nothing to

173
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,900
clean up the the industry and in Holland

174
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,290
at all

175
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:46,829
when it comes to pesticide use

176
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:49,500
fungicides and things that are bad but

177
00:07:46,829 --> 00:07:52,019
that means they don't have a market that

178
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,829
actually pushes and tested right now as

179
00:07:52,019 --> 00:07:55,379
far as I know

180
00:07:52,829 --> 00:07:57,180
Berkeley isn't sitting in the United

181
00:07:55,379 --> 00:07:58,980
States that actually makes sure that you

182
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:01,439
actually test everything before it hits

183
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:03,270
the floor so it can't have something

184
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:05,610
like Mahatma happen where it comes back

185
00:08:03,269 --> 00:08:08,609
positive after the fact after it's hit

186
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:10,199
the floor so I mean a lot of Education

187
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:12,960
and a lot of work still needs to happen

188
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:14,719
even in regulated societies but going

189
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:17,009
back to what Mark what you were saying

190
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,600
at least they're using it at least

191
00:08:17,009 --> 00:08:20,189
they're finding these things science is

192
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:22,710
being used we are finding these things

193
00:08:20,189 --> 00:08:25,050
because before that would have been an

194
00:08:22,709 --> 00:08:26,909
issue we have to self-police I get to

195
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:29,670
quietly return it to somebody I don't

196
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:32,850
get to publicly humiliate them through

197
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:35,720
the media and say blah did this and blah

198
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:38,040
did that you know that's a whole other

199
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:40,560
industry regulation and I think what I

200
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:42,299
think Todd you wish had happened in the

201
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:45,419
Netherlands so that everybody was held

202
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:46,769
to a standard so they couldn't skirt you

203
00:08:45,419 --> 00:08:49,079
know the illegalities because they're

204
00:08:46,769 --> 00:08:50,789
growing in small conditions wherever

205
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:53,100
they can however they can whenever they

206
00:08:50,789 --> 00:08:55,379
can growing medical cannabis

207
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:57,240
as I say growing cannabis is is easy

208
00:08:55,379 --> 00:08:58,500
growing medical grade cannabis is hard

209
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:05,759
growing medical grade cannabis

210
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:07,350
consistently is an art I don't want to

211
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:09,120
make it into that big of a thing I mean

212
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:11,339
people produce food all the time that's

213
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,750
organic falls under organic standards I

214
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:14,730
mean it can be done I don't personally

215
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:17,068
understand what cannabis other than

216
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:18,839
prohibition cost more than Tomatoes they

217
00:09:17,068 --> 00:09:20,458
flowering about the same time don't they

218
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:23,970
Rob how long does it take for a tomato

219
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:25,708
to to fully form on the vine it's a lot

220
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:28,139
easier to grow cannabis than it is to

221
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:30,479
grow tomatoes you might be able to get a

222
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:32,100
little bit more weight of tomatoes in a

223
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,769
given area yeah you might get more

224
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:36,569
tomatoes in a given area okay but then

225
00:09:34,769 --> 00:09:43,740
they have lost some and rot they get all

226
00:09:36,568 --> 00:09:46,769
kinds of problems but you can you

227
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:48,990
I remember in Lugano and buter Steve had

228
00:09:46,769 --> 00:09:51,089
his tents and he ready for these tunnels

229
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:53,818
then he rented them from a tomato farmer

230
00:09:51,089 --> 00:09:56,190
who had tomatoes growing next to the

231
00:09:53,818 --> 00:09:59,278
steve's sweet tooth and all these

232
00:09:56,190 --> 00:10:01,110
beautiful strains and this when the guy

233
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:04,350
found out what Steve was getting per

234
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:07,889
kilo I he almost fell over like he just

235
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:18,720
couldn't even wrap his head around ever

236
00:10:07,889 --> 00:10:22,039
getting that much first for instance it

237
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:24,629
went commercial growers get a hold of

238
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:27,860
cannabis when it's not a gray area thing

239
00:10:24,629 --> 00:10:30,299
anymore but a tall strong settles out

240
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:32,730
you'll be surprised how inexpensive

241
00:10:30,299 --> 00:10:34,740
it'll be to grow a kind but you know

242
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:38,449
it's it's just another agricultural

243
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:42,180
product at that point yep sure enough

244
00:10:38,448 --> 00:10:45,328
hundred dollars from a 70 year old

245
00:10:42,179 --> 00:10:51,208
Christmas tree that's more work than

246
00:10:45,328 --> 00:10:54,750
cannabis good old cannabis we love the

247
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:56,008
port so Rob Sam what are you guys

248

ah no some ba Joey stuff it's pretty

250
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:15,490
what's a possible sign made from focus

251
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:21,610
that close kind of not yeah we can see

252
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:24,190

255
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:32,049
actually haven't been smoking much

256
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:36,070
anything last few weeks I've been in

257
00:11:32,049 --> 00:11:39,129
Turkey and since I got back here it's

258
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:41,050
been sorta you know same old stuff well

259
00:11:39,129 --> 00:11:44,230
yeah I was in Turkey where I don't smoke

260
00:11:41,049 --> 00:11:48,509
at all for the sake of staying alive

261
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:48,509
caution and staying out of jail

262
00:11:50,850 --> 00:12:06,490
yeah what's going on we've all seen that

263
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:08,620
prison movie about Turkey my childhood

264
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:10,330
that movie right wait

265
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:16,419
take the guys one of the first thing I

266
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:17,770
ever saw about Turkey yeah when I saw

267
00:12:16,419 --> 00:12:19,629
they'll stab you from the waist down

268
00:12:17,769 --> 00:12:23,110
it's legal look I don't think I'm going

269
00:12:19,629 --> 00:12:27,210
to Turkey well it's actually a wonderful

270
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:30,789
place I just did a 15 day road trip with

271
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:33,430
two really nice ladies and went to lots

272
00:12:30,789 --> 00:12:37,000
of villages and talked to lots of old

273
00:12:33,429 --> 00:12:38,709
ladies about what they used to do or

274
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,210
what their mothers used to do isn't kiss

275
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:48,670
maybe so those nice Weaver's ropemaker's

276
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:52,540
oh it's done very cool tracking down the

277
00:12:48,669 --> 00:12:57,789
history of that particular areas hemp

278
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:59,969
and other textile history yeah actually

279
00:12:57,789 --> 00:13:02,259
do you know the it's all about hemp but

280
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:05,769
the history there basically boils down

281
00:13:02,259 --> 00:13:09,039
to rope makers who were and then making

282
00:13:05,769 --> 00:13:13,539
nautical ropes for well since the 15th

283
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:15,309
century Ottoman naval stuff and they

284
00:13:13,539 --> 00:13:17,980
still made their it's kinda ropes up

285
00:13:15,309 --> 00:13:22,029
until just a few years ago and now

286
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:23,889
things kind of come to an end but the

287
00:13:22,029 --> 00:13:25,980
rope-making the last vestige of what was

288
00:13:23,889 --> 00:13:29,679
going on women haven't really woven

289
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:32,860
grain sacks and rugs and things for

290
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:37,779
about 40 50 years in those places was

291
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:39,129
that turkey Turkish growing up yes yes

292
00:13:37,779 --> 00:13:40,839
all those growing right the neighbor a

293
00:13:39,129 --> 00:13:42,370
lot of the the hemp for the weavings and

294
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:44,950
things was grown right in the women's

295
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:46,860
gardens they did a right close to home

296
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:55,120
and close to a water source of course

297
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:56,769
most it was whatever yeah it's it's it's

298
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:00,549
interesting it's the same land race

299
00:13:56,769 --> 00:14:02,590
they're used for for hemp and also was

300
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:06,309
back in the day used for hashish that

301
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:09,129
there weren't varieties for one or the

302
00:14:06,309 --> 00:14:10,539
other as I might have assumed so it

303
00:14:09,129 --> 00:14:13,570
wasn't like it made sure he and strain

304
00:14:10,539 --> 00:14:15,909
per se no and it wasn't like in a poll I

305
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:17,530
mean no I was like in for like an a Paul

306
00:14:15,909 --> 00:14:19,959
where they use the same variety for Reb

307
00:14:17,529 --> 00:14:23,079
and hashish but I also get seeds and

308
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:25,060
make textiles out of it it's not really

309
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:28,180
strong stuff it's not specifically

310
00:14:25,059 --> 00:14:29,949
selected for being really strong dope in

311
00:14:28,179 --> 00:14:33,009
most cases it might have been in certain

312
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:35,080
areas where they made a hashish and were

313
00:14:33,009 --> 00:14:40,029
legendary for it some part of Turkey

314
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:41,470
unknown today but yeah basically when

315
00:14:40,029 --> 00:14:45,159
they thrashed out the seeds they kept

316
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:48,820
the powder and that was what they and it

317
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:51,819
up happens how many plants like Nepal

318
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:54,129
would dual-use industrial and hashish

319
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:58,330
how many regions I should say word

320
00:14:54,129 --> 00:15:01,809
building plants if if it was like that

321
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:03,610
in Turkey as I suspect that would be the

322
00:15:01,809 --> 00:15:07,689
only other place besides an Eightball

323
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:10,000
where I know of three uses of drugs seed

324
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:12,910
and fiber all three taken from the same

325
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,159
standing crop not the same thing grown

326
00:15:12,909 --> 00:15:20,529
three different ways but taken from the

327
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:23,319
same crop and that four seed and fiber

328
00:15:20,529 --> 00:15:24,970
of course that's really common but for

329
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:27,760
were crossing over to the drug side

330
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:29,710
that's that's rare now I would assume

331
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:32,169
that back in the day

332
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:35,259
I mean since subsistence farmers even

333
00:15:32,169 --> 00:15:37,838
today waste absolutely nothing in there

334
00:15:35,259 --> 00:15:41,799
his produce of their daily lives that

335
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:43,480
they used plants cannabis crops 3 do you

336
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:47,169
know all 3 ways if they were interested

337
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:49,810
in the drug sighs so yeah why not there

338
00:15:47,169 --> 00:15:52,449
was some THC yeah there was some THC nut

339
00:15:49,809 --> 00:15:55,000
but the real abnormal of European temper

340
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:56,650
ID as we know today are abnormally low

341
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,370
in THC because they've been bred to be

342
00:15:56,649 --> 00:16:00,519
that way

343
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:02,500
I mean just you know it is part of the

344
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:03,309
deal they're not very strong sativa is

345
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,589
to begin with

346
00:16:03,309 --> 00:16:08,049
who knows what's up we'll find out maybe

347
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:14,080
from the Philo's project with Turkish

348
00:16:08,049 --> 00:16:16,799
varieties our Afghan hybrids or

349
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:18,790
something or Indian hybrids with

350
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:23,588
European maybe they're really good

351
00:16:18,789 --> 00:16:26,199
indica sativa hybrid now I have a stupid

352
00:16:23,589 --> 00:16:28,630
question it's the it's it's sativas or

353
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:30,460
industrial Indo European hemp varieties

354
00:16:28,629 --> 00:16:33,338
it came over to North America that we

355
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:35,290
find in Nebraska the stuff that made the

356
00:16:33,339 --> 00:16:38,860
canvas for the covered wagons that went

357
00:16:35,289 --> 00:16:41,969
west is this duh it was never bred to be

358
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:45,159
low THC per se correct back back now

359
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:53,889
modern the modern French and Hungarian

360
00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:59,110
and other varieties regulation 2% blah

361
00:16:53,889 --> 00:17:01,539
blah blah very Todd you got I mean

362
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:06,179
you're Mike and Rob is reverberating

363
00:17:01,539 --> 00:17:06,178
through your mic hairy badly turned on

364
00:17:08,338 --> 00:17:14,109
look go ahead Todd okay my question is

365
00:17:12,068 --> 00:17:16,389
is the indo-european and varieties

366
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:19,719
around the time of Columbus those stuff

367
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:22,120
that came over to America 1500 1600 s

368
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:25,630
even 1700 there wasn't a cotton gin till

369
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:29,019
1791 so all this stuff was never bred

370
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:32,530
for its cannabinoid levels the pre EU

371
00:17:29,019 --> 00:17:35,950
standards that the THC content was never

372
00:17:32,529 --> 00:17:38,139
a conversation in picking for sativas as

373
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:40,360
we call them that then my dumb question

374
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:43,330
is is why is a lot of the feral hemp in

375
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:48,189
Nebraska bunk we

376
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:50,769
I think from my understanding before Rob

377
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:54,340
starts here the Manchurian strain that

378
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:57,190
was grown as a very just tall lanky

379
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:58,990
because hemp is grown 300 to 400 seed

380
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:01,000
per square metre you're talking about a

381
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:04,028
very densely glowing plant as to

382
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,460
supposed to the drug varietal which has

383
00:18:04,028 --> 00:18:09,548
grown given usually a little more space

384
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:11,710
for some reason I'm not sure why

385
00:18:09,548 --> 00:18:15,700
genetically it went the way that it did

386
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:18,220
but most of what is out there

387
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:20,769
feral has just grown so tight and so

388
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:27,069
densely as far as I know it's a

389
00:18:20,769 --> 00:18:30,909
Manchurian strain originally Rob you

390
00:18:27,069 --> 00:18:34,210
need to unmute yourself Rob I might be

391
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:35,980
able to do it there we go he's got it no

392
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:37,179
I don't know about it being a mentor and

393
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:41,460
stirring there there were plenty of

394
00:18:37,179 --> 00:18:44,169
Chinese varieties that were brought into

395
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:50,528
into the North American hemp gene pool

396
00:18:44,169 --> 00:18:53,409
and those in fact back to what taught a

397
00:18:50,528 --> 00:18:58,869
snake first he's correct what what you

398
00:18:53,409 --> 00:19:01,299
see escaped in the Midwest is one of

399
00:18:58,869 --> 00:19:05,408
either two things it's either European

400
00:19:01,298 --> 00:19:07,960
hemp that came here and was sativa

401
00:19:05,409 --> 00:19:10,720
Europeans to team up what's called

402
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:14,519
narrow leaf temp varieties they were the

403
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:18,519
basic colonial cannabis if you will and

404
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:21,579
after that came breeding experiments not

405
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:24,069
to lower THC content certainly using

406
00:19:21,579 --> 00:19:26,259
plants that had a low drug content and

407
00:19:24,069 --> 00:19:28,689
some of those came from China and that's

408
00:19:26,259 --> 00:19:35,619
really led to Kentucky hemp for instance

409
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:38,740
which is a Chinese European hybrid they

410
00:19:35,619 --> 00:19:41,469
didn't know about THC until 1964 how

411
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:44,429
could they breed THC out it wasn't even

412
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:51,500
described in the chemical

413
00:19:44,429 --> 00:19:55,490
wrap they did it in my in my truck

414
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:58,869
they did not beat better start over Jean

415
00:19:55,490 --> 00:20:01,579
they started with gene pools that lacked

416
00:19:58,869 --> 00:20:04,729
THC to begin with whether they were

417
00:20:01,579 --> 00:20:08,119
Chinese gene pools or they were European

418
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:14,390
vehicles they were not selected for high

419
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:16,399
THC content by drug cultures I and I

420
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:18,320
could have said instead of THC I could

421
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,060
have said psychoactive effect easily

422
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:21,950
because that's really what they never

423
00:20:20,059 --> 00:20:24,079
really took that into consideration when

424
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:26,779
they were greeting varieties that they

425
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:29,509
would later use for sales or for ropes

426
00:20:26,779 --> 00:20:32,750
for paints and varnishes or for clothing

427
00:20:29,509 --> 00:20:35,299
I was just wondering if growing an

428
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:37,970
industrial meant that the stuff turned

429
00:20:35,299 --> 00:20:40,519
into a lower cannabinoid level naturally

430
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:42,440
I don't think that's basing like 80 and

431
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:44,359
inferred has anything to do with the

432
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:48,890
chemical level level of the flower at

433
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:52,039
the end of the growth no it doesn't hey

434
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:54,560
Paul we have crops are grown hemp seed

435
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:56,750
and drug crops are growing and very

436
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:59,240
narrow spacing that's so they can get

437
00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:01,160
that hip stalks that they need for the

438
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:04,190
textiles they grow farther apart the

439
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:06,529
fiber be useless so it's part of the

440
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:09,140
growing him for all three crops that was

441
00:21:06,529 --> 00:21:10,490
the same thing wood would hold in Turkey

442
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:14,200
if that's the way they did it which I

443
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:14,200
think they probably did back in the day

444
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:20,150
Rob where those crops self seeded from

445
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:22,850
the harvesting and making a mess or did

446
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:25,580
they actually pick a plant and then hold

447
00:21:22,849 --> 00:21:27,169
those seeds and then try to like replant

448
00:21:25,579 --> 00:21:29,869
was an old self seeding because that's

449
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:32,330
kind of why I thought that the more the

450
00:21:29,869 --> 00:21:34,759
taller plant plants succeed the more

451
00:21:32,329 --> 00:21:37,519
that seed gets spread back to the soil

452
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:39,619
and year after year tall thinner plants

453
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:43,359
become the entire crop and that would be

454
00:21:39,619 --> 00:21:47,239
a form of breeding sure there's there's

455
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:51,019
various unconscious selection if you

456
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:52,460
will even if it's maybe not sterile

457
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:54,170
corrector but people aren't directly

458
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:59,000
being plant breeders and picking one

459
00:21:54,170 --> 00:22:02,269
apparent they're they're applying all

460
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,650
kinds of different selective pressures

461
00:22:02,269 --> 00:22:09,329
to the to the crop

462
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:11,130
a whole two populations and if it

463
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:14,189
depends on what they're doing to answer

464
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:17,220
your question if if people are

465
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:20,850
collecting seeds from tall skinny plants

466
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:25,380
and collected seeds from tall skinny

467
00:22:20,849 --> 00:22:29,399
plants and shaking the seeds out and

468
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:31,290
collecting the powder that's kind of

469
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:33,600
selection is maybe not so important

470
00:22:31,289 --> 00:22:36,000
they've they've patched together pretty

471
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:38,009
much the entire crop except the male's

472
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:43,650
which died by that point if they haven't

473
00:22:38,009 --> 00:22:46,710
been taken out in useful fiber and if if

474
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:50,400
they're for instance growing them for

475
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:52,650
rope use as I just saw the way those

476
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:56,250
farmers did it is they would go after

477
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:57,960
they'd taken the the hemp when it was in

478
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:59,609
August before it's really flowered much

479
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:02,100
when all the stocks have a good fiber

480
00:22:59,609 --> 00:23:05,819
content they can work the whole crop as

481
00:23:02,099 --> 00:23:07,679
as one uniform batch they take those

482
00:23:05,819 --> 00:23:09,149
plants they're pre flowering and around

483
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:11,549
the edge of the field where plants have

484
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:13,800
a few branches anyway they leave those

485
00:23:11,549 --> 00:23:16,470
plants or seeds this is how long growers

486
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:17,940
in Southeast Asia to it so the Koreans

487
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:19,769
used to do it probably have lots and

488
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:21,450
lots of groups did it they take the

489
00:23:19,769 --> 00:23:23,519
fiber first and they get the seeds later

490
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:26,720
but they're not people who also use the

491
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:30,299
plaster drug use that that's this third

492
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:31,890
factor you're throwing in there so in

493
00:23:30,299 --> 00:23:33,599
that case in the case of these rope

494
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:35,280
furrows when I asked them in Turkey and

495
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:38,369
they said yeah we go back in in

496
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:39,899
September and we pull out all the plants

497
00:23:38,369 --> 00:23:43,500
we didn't want and we leave the ones

498
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:46,440
that were the biggest and the greenest

499
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:48,660
they said so those are the ones are

500
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:50,910
yielding the most seed and the ones that

501
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:54,240
are still vigorous late in the year and

502
00:23:50,910 --> 00:24:01,590
maybe even later maturing than ones that

503
00:23:54,240 --> 00:24:03,509
have started to pass away so yeah it

504
00:24:01,589 --> 00:24:05,099
depends on what they're growing it for

505
00:24:03,509 --> 00:24:07,079
which selector pressures would be

506
00:24:05,099 --> 00:24:09,389
important that's kind of what I thought

507
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:11,639
I know of so many harvesting practices

508
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:14,220
where's the knife you use happens to

509
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:16,440
create a certain vibration that spreads

510
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:18,429
the seeds in a good pattern so that

511
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,960
they're receding their crop as they're

512
00:24:18,429 --> 00:24:22,659
harvesting it so there I'm thinking of

513
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:24,940
all the different uses that could go

514
00:24:22,659 --> 00:24:26,919
into naturally driving the plant in one

515
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:28,629
direction or another like you said if

516
00:24:26,919 --> 00:24:30,490
everyone's harvesting early there are no

517
00:24:28,628 --> 00:24:32,528
seeds to self hit the ground after

518
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:35,230
harvest so it would make a big

519
00:24:32,528 --> 00:24:37,388
difference what they are using to pretty

520
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:39,368
much perpetuate on their crops that

521
00:24:37,388 --> 00:24:41,168
someone is harvesting and shaking the

522
00:24:39,368 --> 00:24:44,138
plant and always losing a prosthetic to

523
00:24:41,169 --> 00:24:46,720
the soil well don't don't want to

524
00:24:44,138 --> 00:24:48,278
harvest the seed for the seed oil I mean

525
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,499
I would only assume that you're gonna

526
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:53,740
you know want to grab as much of that

527
00:24:50,499 --> 00:24:57,159
seed oil as you possibly can and the

528
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:59,048
seed protein I mean the seed is is is

529
00:24:57,159 --> 00:25:02,049
really the Golden Nugget in the crop

530
00:24:59,048 --> 00:25:06,368
isn't it yeah even if they're only gonna

531
00:25:02,048 --> 00:25:08,230
to reso's these it's still an outcome

532
00:25:06,368 --> 00:25:10,269
that they need you know that the seeds

533
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:11,288
are precious that the concept if they go

534
00:25:10,269 --> 00:25:14,679
back on the ground and there's

535
00:25:11,288 --> 00:25:16,599
volunteers that come up unselected by

536
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:19,690
the farmer that's probably not likely

537
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:21,788
they rotation planted hemp at least in

538
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:23,590
Turkey and they did most places too it's

539
00:25:21,788 --> 00:25:26,558
a great soil conditioner so they monitor

540
00:25:23,589 --> 00:25:29,798
at a marginal a much more economic

541
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:33,038
source of protein than is soybean and if

542
00:25:29,798 --> 00:25:36,278
so if you look at the the life cycle

543
00:25:33,038 --> 00:25:40,599
analysis between soybean and hemp hemp

544
00:25:36,278 --> 00:25:44,079
seed wins hands down and so it's just a

545
00:25:40,599 --> 00:25:47,589
matter of time before that really makes

546
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:49,538
great to processed foods worldwide as

547
00:25:47,589 --> 00:25:54,788
beasts more sub protein because it's

548
00:25:49,538 --> 00:25:58,419
cheaper than soybean and more abundant

549
00:25:54,788 --> 00:26:03,368
and actually more because that's the

550
00:25:58,419 --> 00:26:06,490
higher of the pallium special yeah

551
00:26:03,368 --> 00:26:09,249
that's good food that that's not however

552
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:12,490
really emphasis where I just was I never

553
00:26:09,249 --> 00:26:14,200
found anybody who made hip seed oil they

554
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:15,999
did eat the seeds I never went to waste

555
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:19,028
but they basically just parched him

556
00:26:15,999 --> 00:26:22,629
usually along with barley and ate him as

557
00:26:19,028 --> 00:26:25,480
a snack they still do now now tragically

558
00:26:22,628 --> 00:26:27,398
enough though they they don't grow the

559
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:29,858
hip seeds very much in Turkey anymore if

560
00:26:27,398 --> 00:26:31,928
at all web and the markets but they

561
00:26:29,858 --> 00:26:34,388
import them from as a tree

562
00:26:31,929 --> 00:26:35,649
thought they'd come by ship I think from

563
00:26:34,388 --> 00:26:38,558
India or Pakistan

564
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:41,678
that's right India is the market corner

565
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:44,528
and it goes mostly I've found very

566
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:47,710
surprisingly into animal feed again it's

567
00:26:44,528 --> 00:26:50,679
a very cheap source of protein that they

568
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:54,190
can use the supplement alfalfa and oats

569
00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:56,950
that are basically fed to animals for

570
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:59,350
animal husbandry do you know where they

571
00:26:56,950 --> 00:27:00,639
grow these seed crops in India I was

572
00:26:59,349 --> 00:27:03,638
wondering that when they were telling me

573
00:27:00,638 --> 00:27:05,498
this I think it's mostly in a moderate

574
00:27:03,638 --> 00:27:07,719
equatorial region through the Punjab

575
00:27:05,499 --> 00:27:10,230
region of India is sort of one of the

576
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:13,450
classical agricultural areas where I'm

577
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:17,528
absolutely certain that again there's

578
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:18,788
just wild all around on the roadside Rob

579
00:27:17,528 --> 00:27:20,878
just as you're driving through the

580
00:27:18,788 --> 00:27:25,269
countryside it's just growing everywhere

581
00:27:20,878 --> 00:27:28,628
everywhere yeah this is pretty small

582
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:30,099
seeds most of it it was not even as big

583
00:27:28,628 --> 00:27:31,859
as the local seeds which was kind of

584
00:27:30,099 --> 00:27:34,898
interesting to me it could be all my

585
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:37,599
wild stuff that's what it implies you do

586
00:27:34,898 --> 00:27:41,768
bigger than more of a hand of man yeah

587
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:43,028
yeah I would agree I think the varieties

588
00:27:41,769 --> 00:27:45,460
that they're actually intentionally

589
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:48,240
farming for oil and for seed purpose for

590
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:51,600
seed flour again it's a much different

591
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:55,778
variety than what's growing wild one

592
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:58,990
yeah iota since up yeah this it's kind

593
00:27:55,778 --> 00:28:01,929
of sad that the cultural momentum to eat

594
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:04,028
hemp seeds is still there you can still

595
00:28:01,929 --> 00:28:05,528
buy them in the markets big bags of them

596
00:28:04,028 --> 00:28:07,509
but they can't grow their own

597
00:28:05,528 --> 00:28:09,159
conveniently you know are economically

598
00:28:07,509 --> 00:28:10,089
or whatever it's not illegal to grow

599
00:28:09,159 --> 00:28:12,278
hemp seeds him

600
00:28:10,089 --> 00:28:15,220
we haven't Turkey it just takes a lesson

601
00:28:12,278 --> 00:28:17,319
Tom wait something's got a change I mean

602
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:20,769
this is actually a convenient point to

603
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:24,638
bring up what I saw from Lyon Laughlin

604
00:28:20,769 --> 00:28:27,669
some Twitterers this week which is he's

605
00:28:24,638 --> 00:28:30,729
a hemp farmer in Colorado who's grown a

606
00:28:27,669 --> 00:28:34,240
crop that apparently analyzes at 0.5%

607
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:36,490
and the state is telling him that they

608
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:39,118
need to dispose of this crop it can't be

609
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:42,638
used commercially because of it's

610
00:28:39,118 --> 00:28:45,778
analyzing at 0.5 and not 0.3 which is

611
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:45,778
the arbitrary cutoff

612
00:28:45,829 --> 00:28:51,980
absolutely [ __ ] ridiculous to have to

613
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:54,800
throw away an entire crop now again the

614
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:59,120
the margin of error in making an HPLC

615
00:28:54,799 --> 00:29:00,980
measurement is you know depends on how

616
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:03,529
the sample is handled and how it's dried

617
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:06,529
and obviously anybody who's ever done

618
00:29:03,529 --> 00:29:08,928
any testing on a plant will tell you

619
00:29:06,529 --> 00:29:10,940
that the top will analyze very different

620
00:29:08,929 --> 00:29:13,070
than the bottom of the plant so these

621
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:15,080
state testers are basically going after

622
00:29:13,069 --> 00:29:17,149
the tops of the plant that have the

623
00:29:15,079 --> 00:29:21,379
highest resin content and okay they're

624
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:25,460
finding slightly out of spec higher THC

625
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:29,240
a content and allow so now the crop is

626
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:32,450
officially deemed marijuana and not hemp

627
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:35,000
anymore in always been my frustration

628
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:37,580
with them on the French EU seed with

629
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:40,640
that arbitrary number because it is

630
00:29:37,579 --> 00:29:42,919
exactly that arbitrary correct me if I'm

631
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,750
wrong Rob but I mean we found when we

632
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:46,820
actually started doing experiments with

633
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:51,349
hemp we found even high-grade cannabis

634
00:29:46,819 --> 00:29:53,629
can make some really nice huh yeah it

635
00:29:51,349 --> 00:29:55,129
depends on when you're trying to make

636
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:59,690
hemp it depends on how you're growing it

637
00:29:55,130 --> 00:30:02,480
it's back to that seed content but it is

638
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:05,090
going to make tall skinny stems if

639
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:08,808
that's what you want to do have a higher

640
00:30:05,089 --> 00:30:11,959
fiber content in many industrial their

641
00:30:08,808 --> 00:30:19,369
varieties yeah yeah when tested by dr.

642
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:23,808
Burgess yeah it just seems so arbitrary

643
00:30:19,369 --> 00:30:25,789
and again you could certainly take many

644
00:30:23,808 --> 00:30:27,920
many different samples and still not

645
00:30:25,789 --> 00:30:32,450
have an accurate statistical

646
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:35,808
representation of the actual THC content

647
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:37,970
of the entire I mean if the notion is is

648
00:30:35,808 --> 00:30:40,519
that the tops are out of spec well what

649
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:44,179
if he just waxed off the tops and just

650
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:45,829
uses the bottom for fiber uses that's

651
00:30:44,179 --> 00:30:48,429
exactly what you they have to do its

652
00:30:45,829 --> 00:30:50,779
batch testing and they have to take

653
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:52,400
parts of all our samples from different

654
00:30:50,779 --> 00:30:54,440
parts of the plant they're not

655
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:56,030
approaching it by taking a flour sample

656
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:58,470
like it was drugs and looking for the

657
00:30:56,029 --> 00:31:00,028
stoniest part that's

658
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:04,798
not the way it's done here they've

659
00:31:00,028 --> 00:31:06,960
adopted the 0.3 EU stand former EU

660
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:09,509
standard it's now point two but they

661
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:12,569
didn't seem to have adopted the sampling

662
00:31:09,509 --> 00:31:13,950
protocol to back it up so maybe that's

663
00:31:12,569 --> 00:31:15,628
how this should be challenged by

664
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:18,058
whoever's got this correct yeah well and

665
00:31:15,628 --> 00:31:19,528
then again what's the best measurement

666
00:31:18,058 --> 00:31:23,038
system that they're using they're using

667
00:31:19,528 --> 00:31:25,378
the HPLC method as described in the AHP

668
00:31:23,038 --> 00:31:27,868
monograph for cannabis is that is that

669
00:31:25,378 --> 00:31:30,269
you know so the protocol is also in the

670
00:31:27,868 --> 00:31:31,859
EU regulations if they want to look it

671
00:31:30,269 --> 00:31:33,749
up it's in there I don't know what they

672
00:31:31,859 --> 00:31:36,689
it's GC I'm pretty sure but it's in

673
00:31:33,749 --> 00:31:41,298
their way I don't think what variety of

674
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:43,889
hemp did they grow I was pointing I

675
00:31:41,298 --> 00:31:46,200
don't know exactly I could actually look

676
00:31:43,888 --> 00:31:48,990
into it I was actually texting with Ryan

677
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:51,569
earlier today I could actually send him

678
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:53,548
a tax and ask now because some varieties

679
00:31:51,569 --> 00:31:56,759
traditionally have problems and other

680
00:31:53,548 --> 00:32:00,028
varieties never have problems yeah so

681
00:31:56,759 --> 00:32:01,950
well it was a cleat was it constant was

682
00:32:00,028 --> 00:32:05,460
it grown seeded or was it grunts in

683
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:06,929
samia um I I don't know I don't really

684
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:10,769
want to comment because first of all

685
00:32:06,929 --> 00:32:14,278
it's not making inquiries into it but

686
00:32:10,769 --> 00:32:16,669
it's like if it was grown sinsemilla

687
00:32:14,278 --> 00:32:20,128
that alone could have knocked it up

688
00:32:16,669 --> 00:32:23,669
right I was thinking too that also the

689
00:32:20,128 --> 00:32:26,839
extraction method that they're using to

690
00:32:23,669 --> 00:32:30,389
analyze the sample can also affect

691
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:33,418
results I mean if you think about it

692
00:32:30,388 --> 00:32:36,868
you're talking about two-tenths of a

693
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:40,619
percent difference between 0.5 and 0.3%

694
00:32:36,868 --> 00:32:44,970
I mean you could mishandle a sample and

695
00:32:40,618 --> 00:32:47,638
knock it out of spec you know run that

696
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:50,429
five times were the five replicates all

697
00:32:47,638 --> 00:32:52,740
within this mystical margin of error I

698
00:32:50,429 --> 00:32:55,009
mean all of this data has to be you

699
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:58,378
can't just say that that crop has got

700
00:32:55,009 --> 00:33:00,569
5.5% burn the crop that's [ __ ]

701
00:32:58,378 --> 00:33:03,148
because again even if you just look at

702
00:33:00,569 --> 00:33:05,970
moisture and how that sample is handed

703
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:11,250
handled in terms of how its analyzed is

704
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:13,470
it the dried crop at 0.3% and is a THC a

705
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:16,019
or is it THC I mean these are all gonna

706
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:18,210
make a difference so I'm gonna I'm gonna

707
00:33:16,019 --> 00:33:20,759
look into this and well if they're smart

708
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:23,250
he'll have it the analysis done by GC

709
00:33:20,759 --> 00:33:27,269
cuz they're always a little bit lower

710
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:29,159
than HPLC yeah the problem with GC is

711
00:33:27,269 --> 00:33:31,859
that GC you're sending it through a

712
00:33:29,159 --> 00:33:34,470
thermal injection port at 200 degrees

713
00:33:31,859 --> 00:33:39,418
and that that changes everything Manny

714
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:42,350
so doesn't raise the THC it lowers the

715
00:33:39,419 --> 00:33:45,570
THC that's his problem

716
00:33:42,349 --> 00:33:48,269
yes yes that's that's that's that's

717
00:33:45,569 --> 00:33:50,548
correct that's correct

718
00:33:48,269 --> 00:33:52,349
we just never [ __ ] around we stuck

719
00:33:50,548 --> 00:33:54,629
with the Zola 2 notion that ship was

720
00:33:52,349 --> 00:33:56,399
like point zero one percent and every

721
00:33:54,630 --> 00:34:01,020
time the lab tested it they were just

722
00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:05,159
like I guess it's industrial hemp or a

723
00:34:01,019 --> 00:34:08,009
whole country basically no flaw because

724
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:11,608
my thing is this though is if we're not

725
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:13,649
well ironically now we are actually

726
00:34:11,608 --> 00:34:17,009
harvesting cannabinoids from hemp

727
00:34:13,648 --> 00:34:19,769
because of the CBD craze call it what

728
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:22,040
you will but I always found it a little

729
00:34:19,769 --> 00:34:24,239
odd that we were having a cannabinoid

730
00:34:22,039 --> 00:34:26,969
conversation when we were really

731
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:30,088
harvesting seeds and fibers and

732
00:34:26,969 --> 00:34:33,299
cellulose and now maybe with

733
00:34:30,088 --> 00:34:35,480
legalization in Colorado Oregon now can

734
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:38,490
we grow hemp varieties that are not

735
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:40,579
cannabinoid limited but maybe the best

736
00:34:38,489 --> 00:34:44,908
expressions that could grow in that area

737
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:50,878
that's really that's really my question

738
00:34:44,909 --> 00:34:52,919
and as we lose robot forest well I

739
00:34:50,878 --> 00:34:54,389
absolutely I just wanted to make it in

740
00:34:52,918 --> 00:34:56,699
something I think that Chris put is a

741
00:34:54,389 --> 00:34:59,190
message here which is that I've heard

742
00:34:56,699 --> 00:35:02,368
from hemp farmers in Colorado that time

743
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:04,889
of day when those are harvested you know

744
00:35:02,369 --> 00:35:07,170
absolutely looking at the profile of the

745
00:35:04,889 --> 00:35:10,230
plant during the end of flowering it's

746
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:15,108
absolutely essential to meet that point

747
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:15,108
three cutoff odds on high CBD strains

748
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:23,039
hey there's Mickey Mouse making his

749
00:35:20,969 --> 00:35:26,219
first appearance on half judge isn't

750
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:29,940
that [ __ ] Mickey Mickey Mouse is an

751
00:35:26,219 --> 00:35:32,818
old head yeah that's [ __ ] Mickey hey

752
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:34,619
welcome Tony and I guess welcome Brendon

753
00:35:32,818 --> 00:35:37,380
Dabbs who can't even left faster than we

754
00:35:34,619 --> 00:35:39,869
can say hello and of course welcome to

755
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:42,680
Chris Bennett's who came in while Rob

756
00:35:39,869 --> 00:35:42,680
was chatting away

757
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:50,659
hey so Rob what do you think the first

758
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:54,690
evidence of cannabis growing for

759
00:35:50,659 --> 00:35:56,730
psychoactive purposes ears based on you

760
00:35:54,690 --> 00:36:01,309
know her biological data and stuff like

761
00:35:56,730 --> 00:36:04,199
that I don't know I guess it's still I

762
00:36:01,309 --> 00:36:07,619
don't know it's sort of back to that

763
00:36:04,199 --> 00:36:10,578
same twenty five hundred twenty two

764
00:36:07,619 --> 00:36:13,140
hundred years ago sort of Windows 7

765
00:36:10,579 --> 00:36:16,680
stuff all moving around in Central Asia

766
00:36:13,139 --> 00:36:18,900
maybe a bit earlier there Eastern Europe

767
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:22,889
oh boy it's just all that stuff comes up

768
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:24,838
about that same time tonight it seemed

769
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:26,629
like a lot of stuff I've read the

770
00:36:24,838 --> 00:36:28,828
Chinese distinguished between their

771
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:31,740
initial hemp crop that they were growing

772
00:36:28,829 --> 00:36:33,359
for fiber and seed whatnot and then that

773
00:36:31,739 --> 00:36:35,729
of the later like Cynthia in hemp they

774
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:37,199
would call it or you know fire hamper

775
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:39,539
you know that what the GU shoes were

776
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:41,098
using likely do you think that that came

777
00:36:39,539 --> 00:36:45,599
in and there were two different strains

778
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:49,349
their drug content plants then maybe be

779
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:52,289
a indo-europeans uh and then there's

780
00:36:49,349 --> 00:36:54,059
already an indigenous Chinese industrial

781
00:36:52,289 --> 00:36:56,699
thing because most of the even the

782
00:36:54,059 --> 00:36:58,739
Chinese psychoactive purposes you know

783
00:36:56,699 --> 00:37:00,509
we can see in the literature seems to

784
00:36:58,739 --> 00:37:03,358
start around that same time and last

785
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:08,180
week but that date in place 100 BC on

786
00:37:03,358 --> 00:37:10,380
Chen Nam you know which is yeah that's

787
00:37:08,179 --> 00:37:12,269
allegorical sort of stuff but yeah

788
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:16,039
that's around that same time and later

789
00:37:12,269 --> 00:37:20,730
in history Chinese historians refer to

790
00:37:16,039 --> 00:37:23,519
to Western cannabis tea mom so it was

791
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:25,019
probably introduced at some point this

792
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:27,869
is later on in time that they're talking

793
00:37:25,019 --> 00:37:29,309
about this but yeah there was a Western

794
00:37:27,869 --> 00:37:31,350
influence wouldn't which in their case

795
00:37:29,309 --> 00:37:35,469
when I'm

796
00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:36,880
well what a meant that it was introduced

797
00:37:35,469 --> 00:37:39,250
to the later time when they already knew

798
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:42,670
about Tama the other haps

799
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:44,980
yeah so what about think about this

800
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:47,409
recent Scythian thing with the gold

801
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:50,289
bowls and cups that were mistakenly

802
00:37:47,409 --> 00:37:51,849
reported as belongs in in the press but

803
00:37:50,289 --> 00:37:54,610
we're actually a preparations for

804
00:37:51,849 --> 00:37:56,469
drinking cannabis yes well there there

805
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:58,510
were nice balls and if we're gonna

806
00:37:56,469 --> 00:38:01,269
follow your where they came from and

807
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:02,580
you're dating in things the assumption

808
00:38:01,269 --> 00:38:05,980
would be that they were from some

809
00:38:02,579 --> 00:38:08,440
libation Rhossili cannabis yes yeah I

810
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:09,789
wish they were decorated somehow those

811
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:11,880
more indicative of that but that's

812
00:38:09,789 --> 00:38:15,279
that's what I say about most things that

813
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:17,170
hint at what we're after but yeah yeah

814
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:19,090
well it's always hurt by some sort of

815
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:20,440
symbolic yeah drawing or something like

816
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:29,350
that you want some a little more solid

817
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:32,579
fitter welcome Tony and Brendon dab-dab

818
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:36,219
alicia's who just came into the room

819
00:38:32,579 --> 00:38:42,940
we're chatting it up old school Chris

820
00:38:36,219 --> 00:38:45,339
and Rob talk in history note whether the

821
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:48,099
synth Ian was coming from someplace else

822
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:52,360
you know Cynthia genetics yeah we'd have

823
00:38:48,099 --> 00:38:55,719
to know genetics agenda yet the Green

824
00:38:52,360 --> 00:39:00,280
crack god yes I have a question for

825
00:38:55,719 --> 00:39:04,719
Robin Sam Robin am if you were left with

826
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:07,740
one genetic only one genetic what

827
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:07,739
genetic would you choose

828
00:39:11,409 --> 00:39:21,159
hey Donald was gonna answer sorry to

829
00:39:18,219 --> 00:39:22,869
catch her even Rob Oh Rob's muted it to

830
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:29,589
let me unmute Rob so we can hear him

831
00:39:22,869 --> 00:39:34,299
chewing actually is that by myself

832
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:36,340
uh somebody long me a cell phone last

833
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:38,110
week that was really a scream now now

834
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:41,260
where are you gonna uh where are you

835
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:44,380
gonna grow this aikens it's you it's you

836
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:46,060
it's you Rob and you if you had your

837
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:47,920
choice wherever you are in the world and

838
00:39:46,059 --> 00:39:50,170
you grew one strain and you were left

839
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:57,119
with one strain what strain would you

840
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:57,119
choose like a grown-up yeah you have

841
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:08,440
grown outdoors yep

842
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:11,289
respect double yep same with me you know

843
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:12,700
I I gotta say that I'm damn near in the

844
00:40:11,289 --> 00:40:18,750
same boat with you guys

845
00:40:12,699 --> 00:40:22,809
haze outdoors bong flowering however I

846
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:35,769
really think that a universe where I

847
00:40:22,809 --> 00:40:41,769
could only grow I'm so tired of a three

848
00:40:35,769 --> 00:40:44,289
years latter days could you imagine how

849
00:40:41,769 --> 00:40:46,509
perfect that the resin and all of the

850
00:40:44,289 --> 00:40:48,579
products made from the resolutely like

851
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:51,790
you if everyone was working on one

852
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:53,889
strain one resin and there was and there

853
00:40:51,789 --> 00:40:56,349
was a legends of hash and it was like

854
00:40:53,889 --> 00:40:58,420
well I've got the I've got the outdoor

855
00:40:56,349 --> 00:41:00,909
haze oh yeah you too I've got some

856
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:02,110
outdoor haze yeah we've aw we've all got

857
00:41:00,909 --> 00:41:04,239
the same string well let me see your

858
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:06,250
resin and then it would really be

859
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:07,839
competitive to get that resin nailed

860
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:11,199
down but at the end of the day it would

861
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:14,650
all just still be the same cereal the

862
00:41:11,199 --> 00:41:16,929
same resin I I'd immediately start

863
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:19,950
working on it until I could get resin at

864
00:41:16,929 --> 00:41:21,899
least the size of grapes yeah

865
00:41:19,949 --> 00:41:25,949
why haven't you been

866
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:29,880
on that I have it just hasn't gotten

867
00:41:25,949 --> 00:41:31,649
very far yet it's exponential they'll

868
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:37,440
grow the most right in the last few

869
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:40,769
stages what I'd like to see is somebody

870
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:43,409
really working on me it'd be a good

871
00:41:40,769 --> 00:41:45,420
choice with close friend here but

872
00:41:43,409 --> 00:41:48,029
working on really making hashish

873
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:51,570
varieties things that aren't necessarily

874
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:53,370
anything like the bud and a bag sort of

875
00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:56,910
model that people have been breeding to

876
00:41:53,369 --> 00:41:58,739
for the last 20 years more so yeah just

877
00:41:56,909 --> 00:42:01,079
different try to read some different

878
00:41:58,739 --> 00:42:04,259
things narrowly think outside the block

879
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:06,929
outside the box a bit would you guys

880
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:10,080
consider hash strange to be strange that

881
00:42:06,929 --> 00:42:12,029
either produce a certain resin head size

882
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:14,130
consistently like good for hash like

883
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:16,560
this makes us under 70 you or what a

884
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:18,990
hash train be about robust complex

885
00:42:16,559 --> 00:42:22,139
terpenes and the experience rather than

886
00:42:18,989 --> 00:42:24,719
gearing it towards yields for hash well

887
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:27,029
there's two are you talking about today

888
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:29,309
in the future or are you talking about

889
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:31,470
traditionally because traditionally has

890
00:42:29,309 --> 00:42:34,739
strands were strings that were made into

891
00:42:31,469 --> 00:42:36,329
hashish well I just I see people say

892
00:42:34,739 --> 00:42:38,429
like this is the hash plant and I'm like

893
00:42:36,329 --> 00:42:40,259
I'm not gonna get a [ __ ] ton of dry sif

894
00:42:38,429 --> 00:42:42,269
off of this but it might be the best

895
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:43,920
hash I've ever had in my life based on

896
00:42:42,269 --> 00:42:45,659
the way it looks the way it smells

897
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:48,809
that's kind of why I'm like well look

898
00:42:45,659 --> 00:42:50,639
there's two sides of hash one is like we

899
00:42:48,809 --> 00:42:52,710
could just go around smelling the jars

900
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:54,750
of dry sip and that would be an

901
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:56,579
experience of itself with never smoking

902
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:58,739
it that's kind of why I'm like look I

903
00:42:56,579 --> 00:43:01,319
have a lot of strains that I love and I

904
00:42:58,739 --> 00:43:02,849
think this might make great hash but in

905
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:06,390
the end it might just produce a [ __ ] ton

906
00:43:02,849 --> 00:43:08,069
245 you and that's not good for hash you

907
00:43:06,389 --> 00:43:11,609
know for instance a friend's and so that

908
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:14,580
is is the beloved haze it has great

909
00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:16,800
resin little tiny glands with lots of it

910
00:43:14,579 --> 00:43:19,289
kicks your ass has a greater fiend

911
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:21,690
profile whatever it takes but it is

912
00:43:19,289 --> 00:43:24,059
miserable as far as getting at any kind

913
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:26,309
of a residue from this really

914
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:28,590
disappointing dry sifting into anything

915
00:43:26,309 --> 00:43:30,659
you do that it just doesn't work maybe

916
00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:33,329
you can rub resin from it to get it to

917
00:43:30,659 --> 00:43:35,730
work hybrid but there's yeah there's a

918
00:43:33,329 --> 00:43:37,670
lot of breeding to do if you you're

919
00:43:35,730 --> 00:43:40,650
just of course want varieties that have

920
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:42,690
the right terpene profile and make you

921
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:46,050
just give you whatever effect you want

922
00:43:42,690 --> 00:43:48,059
also produce lots of resin that's easy

923
00:43:46,050 --> 00:43:53,609
to get off the planet no matter are you

924
00:43:48,059 --> 00:43:55,469
gonna do it it's uh economics in the end

925
00:43:53,608 --> 00:43:56,940
is going to be about yield you know all

926
00:43:55,469 --> 00:43:59,939
the restaurants going to be icing on the

927
00:43:56,940 --> 00:44:01,320
cake and and a little extra Vig but

928
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:06,150
basically it's going to be how much you

929
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:06,660
can get of clean resident agricultural

930
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:08,849
unit

931
00:44:06,659 --> 00:44:10,589
well that's kind of what I'm afraid of

932
00:44:08,849 --> 00:44:12,089
because I think of my best yield er and

933
00:44:10,590 --> 00:44:14,640
I'm like I don't want to [ __ ] smoke

934
00:44:12,090 --> 00:44:17,280
grape crush hybrid just because I can

935
00:44:14,639 --> 00:44:19,289
get 20 grams of 70 you sift out of it I

936
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:22,109
want to smoke blueberry when I get a

937
00:44:19,289 --> 00:44:23,789
gram and a half and I just look at it

938
00:44:22,108 --> 00:44:25,409
and worship it so that's kind of why I

939
00:44:23,789 --> 00:44:29,159
wanted your definition of what the

940
00:44:25,409 --> 00:44:31,019
flutter a path should be to be honest I

941
00:44:29,159 --> 00:44:33,539
don't think you have to worry because I

942
00:44:31,019 --> 00:44:37,429
bet you anything we could put pretty

943
00:44:33,539 --> 00:44:41,519
much any terpene profile in any

944
00:44:37,429 --> 00:44:48,199
established resin variety so I don't

945
00:44:41,519 --> 00:44:52,949
think there's a big problem so I agree

946
00:44:48,199 --> 00:44:55,500
we free that leaves my quick questions

947
00:44:52,949 --> 00:44:59,819
in regards to that fans in regards to

948
00:44:55,500 --> 00:45:02,820
when did you go across terpenes as a

949
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:11,460
modulator to connect the cannabinoid

950
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:18,289
profile well about 2000 Rob and I well I

951
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:21,840
obtained some pure THC 100% pure and

952
00:45:18,289 --> 00:45:27,150
what we did was we vaporized 25 million

953
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:34,530
records mate CA yeah it was ta CA but in

954
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:38,389
here we vaporized 25 milligrams each in

955
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:41,850
the volcano on one of those little

956
00:45:38,389 --> 00:45:44,190
they're like little stainless steel

957
00:45:41,849 --> 00:45:46,670
brillo pad those little pads that they

958
00:45:44,190 --> 00:45:49,820
have okay so

959
00:45:46,670 --> 00:45:52,849
we were blown away because I mean if you

960
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:57,470
smoke 25 milligrams of hash or 25

961
00:45:52,849 --> 00:46:01,400
milligrams of you get stoned and you

962
00:45:57,469 --> 00:46:03,980
it's pretty good but with this it the

963
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:08,030
most describable thing about it was that

964
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:11,889
it had no individuality whatsoever like

965
00:46:08,030 --> 00:46:16,280
cannabis products do it was really flat

966
00:46:11,889 --> 00:46:19,129
one-dimensional kind of boring Rob I

967
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:21,769
think at the time actually said if this

968
00:46:19,130 --> 00:46:24,800
is all there is to cannabis I wouldn't

969
00:46:21,769 --> 00:46:28,210
be a smoker yeah if this is what you got

970
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:31,010
turned on to in high school or whatever

971
00:46:28,210 --> 00:46:32,420
yeah instead of the real thing it I

972
00:46:31,010 --> 00:46:37,610
don't think any of us would have really

973
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:39,019
been interested it's sort of like being

974
00:46:37,610 --> 00:46:44,870
a fan of Everclear

975
00:46:39,019 --> 00:46:46,429
you know the 180 something proof liquor

976
00:46:44,869 --> 00:46:48,529
you can get in Nevada it's not even

977
00:46:46,429 --> 00:46:50,839
legal in the state of California but

978
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:52,460
it's nothing all essentially and nobody

979
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:54,320
drinks it straight I mean you know

980
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:55,990
nobody just dilutes over the water and

981
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:59,990
drinks because they like it it's a

982
00:46:55,989 --> 00:47:04,549
novelty and THC is the same thing it had

983
00:46:59,989 --> 00:47:09,409
no color at all so later that day what

984
00:47:04,550 --> 00:47:15,830
we did was we mixed it with a little bit

985
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:20,269
of 50% dry sipped skunk present and what

986
00:47:15,829 --> 00:47:24,529
thousand loud was to create a material

987
00:47:20,269 --> 00:47:26,960
that was 75 percent THC so less than 100

988
00:47:24,530 --> 00:47:29,990
percent but it was also chirping rich

989
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:31,880
from the resin from the dry said when we

990
00:47:29,989 --> 00:47:35,479
smoked bat the effects were twice as

991
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:38,450
strong as the pure THC and a light went

992
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:41,630
on in our heads because from the early

993
00:47:38,449 --> 00:47:46,069
70s both Robert and I even before we met

994
00:47:41,630 --> 00:47:49,280
had felt the terpenes might well

995
00:47:46,070 --> 00:47:51,990
contribute to the synergistic effects

996
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:54,630
founding cannabis

997
00:47:51,989 --> 00:47:59,159
I think one of the primary reasons was

998
00:47:54,630 --> 00:48:02,760
because haze when it was tested for its

999
00:47:59,159 --> 00:48:06,329
THC level was to be you know and the

1000
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:09,480
high end of cannabis but when you smoked

1001
00:48:06,329 --> 00:48:13,650
it it was in the outer space of cannabis

1002
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:15,960
I mean it was really really active and I

1003
00:48:13,650 --> 00:48:18,539
think that was because of the terpenes I

1004
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:21,530
think that's how you thought well it

1005
00:48:18,539 --> 00:48:24,719
does the other amazing thing in the

1006
00:48:21,530 --> 00:48:26,519
early 70s and was that people started

1007
00:48:24,719 --> 00:48:28,469
growing cannabis you know they start

1008
00:48:26,519 --> 00:48:31,349
growing sinsemilla and that's when you

1009
00:48:28,469 --> 00:48:34,699
really noticed what the difference was

1010
00:48:31,349 --> 00:48:37,380
between fresh homegrown and what

1011
00:48:34,699 --> 00:48:40,739
imported weed of whatever kind you ever

1012
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:44,640
got before what that was you know it was

1013
00:48:40,739 --> 00:48:48,239
eat that was a profound difference you

1014
00:48:44,639 --> 00:48:51,089
know just to see something fresh mother

1015
00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:54,599
nature density the essence of most of

1016
00:48:51,090 --> 00:48:58,320
the weed that you smoked back in the 70s

1017
00:48:54,599 --> 00:49:01,889
a moldy musty essence you know I mean I

1018
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:05,280
remember my first bag of weed 1974 it

1019
00:49:01,889 --> 00:49:11,639
was it was moldy now that I think about

1020
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:13,290
it it certainly was more I think most of

1021
00:49:11,639 --> 00:49:15,449
what Robert and I got even though it was

1022
00:49:13,289 --> 00:49:19,579
imported it was not moldy or if it was

1023
00:49:15,449 --> 00:49:19,579
it was very very very very slightly a

1024
00:49:20,510 --> 00:49:25,740
general statement that most of the

1025
00:49:22,739 --> 00:49:28,399
commercial weed at the time essentially

1026
00:49:25,739 --> 00:49:31,829
which came from Mexico was probably

1027
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:34,050
fouled with with mold and all kinds of

1028
00:49:31,829 --> 00:49:35,489
different microbes if you look very hard

1029
00:49:34,050 --> 00:49:37,410
you would have found things for sure and

1030
00:49:35,489 --> 00:49:39,719
sound but of course is unsmoked belies

1031
00:49:37,409 --> 00:49:43,409
you know just when it was just playing

1032
00:49:39,719 --> 00:49:47,819
right yeah but okay Don dead tour in the

1033
00:49:43,409 --> 00:49:50,819
mid 70s by 1980 I was hooked up well

1034
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:51,990
meanwhile back to terpene so we we

1035
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:54,840
smoked the pure tree

1036
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:58,349
THC would rise this ain't it we smoked

1037
00:49:54,840 --> 00:50:01,890
THC mixed with resin 5050 which rate 75

1038
00:49:58,349 --> 00:50:04,799
percent THC by dry weight and Wow that

1039
00:50:01,889 --> 00:50:05,609
that was very interesting so then what

1040
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:08,370
we did here

1041
00:50:05,610 --> 00:50:11,519
to later we obtained all the

1042
00:50:08,369 --> 00:50:18,420
cannabinoids so oh the top 10

1043
00:50:11,519 --> 00:50:23,150
cannabinoids THC CBD CBG TV etc etc and

1044
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:25,500
we also obtained the top 10 terpenes and

1045
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:29,039
then we were able to try the different

1046
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:31,019
cannabinoids and we found out that a

1047
00:50:29,039 --> 00:50:35,190
couple of interesting things like number

1048
00:50:31,019 --> 00:50:37,650
one if you smoke pure CBD in a fairly

1049
00:50:35,190 --> 00:50:40,860
large amount a tenth of a gram one

1050
00:50:37,650 --> 00:50:44,070
hundred milligrams then what happens is

1051
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:47,309
it blocks the activity of even the

1052
00:50:44,070 --> 00:50:50,640
strongest dreicer - for about eight to

1053
00:50:47,309 --> 00:50:52,889
twelve hours so that was interesting

1054
00:50:50,639 --> 00:50:57,299
the other interesting thing was the THC

1055
00:50:52,889 --> 00:50:59,599
B is not psychoactive at all because a

1056
00:50:57,300 --> 00:51:02,670
lot of people that time believed it was

1057
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:06,329
then we tried all the different terpenes

1058
00:51:02,670 --> 00:51:09,300
with THC so we tried twenty-five

1059
00:51:06,329 --> 00:51:13,170
milligrams of THC all double-blinded

1060
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:15,630
with one terpene you know as tiny amount

1061
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:17,700
as we could put it with it and what we

1062
00:51:15,630 --> 00:51:22,610
found out was that they're seen by

1063
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:26,669
maligne tiny and a few other definitely

1064
00:51:22,610 --> 00:51:29,760
potentiated THC and most of the others

1065
00:51:26,670 --> 00:51:32,849
are a lot of the others also modulated

1066
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:36,480
THC to different levels so some made to

1067
00:51:32,849 --> 00:51:39,269
couch lock some made you speedy and it

1068
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:41,849
was like a revelation I mean we had

1069
00:51:39,269 --> 00:51:44,579
suspected it but we never never really

1070
00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:46,710
dreamed it would be that clear because

1071
00:51:44,579 --> 00:51:49,769
we did it with 12 different double

1072
00:51:46,710 --> 00:51:52,590
blinded test subjects with a hundred

1073
00:51:49,769 --> 00:51:55,170
questions survey before and after and we

1074
00:51:52,590 --> 00:51:58,079
all agreed on the same things the

1075
00:51:55,170 --> 00:52:03,720
different people preferred the couch

1076
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:05,880
lock or the uplifting but they all

1077
00:52:03,719 --> 00:52:10,009
agreed that that particular compound

1078
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:13,880
with THC had that effect so

1079
00:52:10,010 --> 00:52:16,370
laughs so this was all you know maybe 12

1080
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:18,950
years ago or 13 years ago although we

1081
00:52:16,369 --> 00:52:23,719
started it practically 15 years ago and

1082
00:52:18,949 --> 00:52:25,069
it's a yeah it's it's now at first I was

1083
00:52:23,719 --> 00:52:27,230
afraid to release the information

1084
00:52:25,070 --> 00:52:31,640
because I thought people would start

1085
00:52:27,230 --> 00:52:36,429
coming out with skunky Sam's improve

1086
00:52:31,639 --> 00:52:39,589
your weed spray during mold to gold and

1087
00:52:36,429 --> 00:52:41,779
they have to a certain degree but what

1088
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:43,880
the better side of it is when people are

1089
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:46,160
extracting terpenes from the natural

1090
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:48,619
cannabis sources and then adding them

1091
00:52:46,159 --> 00:52:50,569
back to the same that's that's pretty

1092
00:52:48,619 --> 00:52:52,219
benign as long as no chemicals and

1093
00:52:50,570 --> 00:52:55,460
solvents are being left earth

1094
00:52:52,219 --> 00:52:57,980
yeah I don't know what to say but the

1095
00:52:55,460 --> 00:53:00,619
truth of it is it it's changed cannabis

1096
00:52:57,980 --> 00:53:05,269
and I understand it will continue to

1097
00:53:00,619 --> 00:53:08,989
learn but it's really big well I'd

1098
00:53:05,269 --> 00:53:10,460
really like to see done is is something

1099
00:53:08,989 --> 00:53:14,599
much more sophisticated than we were

1100
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:17,380
able to do you know and see see science

1101
00:53:14,599 --> 00:53:19,519
put to bear on this situation and see

1102
00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:21,559
what we can learn about different

1103
00:53:19,519 --> 00:53:24,590
terpene combinations with different

1104
00:53:21,559 --> 00:53:28,219
cannabinoids it's there's 140 of them

1105
00:53:24,590 --> 00:53:34,280
seems the most interesting Avenue for me

1106
00:53:28,219 --> 00:53:35,000
at the moment no right that's just what

1107
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:37,610
we know so far

1108
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:39,170
yeah it's over really in trace amounts

1109
00:53:37,610 --> 00:53:44,090
and it doesn't mean they're not

1110
00:53:39,170 --> 00:53:47,690
important that but about 20 of them make

1111
00:53:44,090 --> 00:53:49,460
up most of the terpenes and in cannabis

1112
00:53:47,690 --> 00:53:51,200
we smoke today but there's a smattering

1113
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:53,179
of other poor other compounds and they

1114
00:53:51,199 --> 00:53:55,819
could be key oh so so yeah there could

1115
00:53:53,179 --> 00:53:59,719
be a 100 terpenes we just have an idea

1116
00:53:55,820 --> 00:54:02,420
yet yeah but the smaller the amounts the

1117
00:53:59,719 --> 00:54:09,500
less significant they are likely to be

1118
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:13,820
just by odds there's probably also heavy

1119
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:15,769
selective pressures involved recently

1120
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:19,160
you know in a way of people breeding I

1121
00:54:15,769 --> 00:54:21,130
mean firmness there's or almost people

1122
00:54:19,159 --> 00:54:25,149
like

1123
00:54:21,130 --> 00:54:28,000
and there's effects they expect based on

1124
00:54:25,150 --> 00:54:29,680
that aroma it's this feedback loop thing

1125
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,909
that makes it all kind of hard to study

1126
00:54:29,679 --> 00:54:37,778
in a more detailed way and it's and it's

1127
00:54:32,909 --> 00:54:40,750
it's uh it's important those things are

1128
00:54:37,778 --> 00:54:42,639
somehow related but they're not as

1129
00:54:40,750 --> 00:54:44,380
relate related in the way I would have

1130
00:54:42,639 --> 00:54:47,078
thought of biochemical sort of way

1131
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:49,269
they're more related in in what we

1132
00:54:47,079 --> 00:54:50,769
individually make of each variety and

1133
00:54:49,268 --> 00:54:53,409
our relationship with it

1134
00:54:50,768 --> 00:54:56,919
it's gifts I know I'm sending the cosmic

1135
00:54:53,409 --> 00:54:58,690
for the scientist guy but it's

1136
00:54:56,920 --> 00:55:00,970
impossible to separate one from the

1137
00:54:58,690 --> 00:55:05,048
other I'm not even sure exactly how you

1138
00:55:00,969 --> 00:55:07,179
would do it statistically rigorous tests

1139
00:55:05,048 --> 00:55:09,880
of the terpene and can't and can happen

1140
00:55:07,179 --> 00:55:11,528
oh I did it'd be interesting for

1141
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:14,650
somebody to set it up there's a lot more

1142
00:55:11,528 --> 00:55:16,358
powerful tools now that we know they are

1143
00:55:14,650 --> 00:55:17,259
biochemically related there's no

1144
00:55:16,358 --> 00:55:19,150
question about it

1145
00:55:17,259 --> 00:55:20,798
of course but of course but that's not

1146
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:23,139
the only relationship is what I'd say

1147
00:55:20,798 --> 00:55:24,788
all right and I've always wondered if

1148
00:55:23,139 --> 00:55:27,338
they're competing pathways I mean they

1149
00:55:24,789 --> 00:55:29,440
use the same precursors so what exactly

1150
00:55:27,338 --> 00:55:32,018
is going on hard to say but we certainly

1151
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:35,019
jacked up both pathways and the modern

1152
00:55:32,018 --> 00:55:38,768
seen some here varieties and these these

1153
00:55:35,018 --> 00:55:41,199
hybrids are big producers of all of the

1154
00:55:38,768 --> 00:55:42,669
above yeah it's not like there's a

1155
00:55:41,199 --> 00:55:45,308
shortage of one thing or another

1156
00:55:42,670 --> 00:55:48,909
they the terpenes seem to have become

1157
00:55:45,309 --> 00:55:51,400
sort of a mishmash and it's more now

1158
00:55:48,909 --> 00:55:53,639
what what plants don't have rather than

1159
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:58,930
what they have in my mind that's sort of

1160
00:55:53,639 --> 00:56:00,548
that what makes a variety and that's

1161
00:55:58,929 --> 00:56:04,210
characteristic and the white smells to

1162
00:56:00,548 --> 00:56:06,159
me is a key chirping it has a couple of

1163
00:56:04,210 --> 00:56:07,480
them but also all the terpenes that it's

1164
00:56:06,159 --> 00:56:11,528
lacking so that it doesn't smell like

1165
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:13,659
everything else it's it's pretty inbred

1166
00:56:11,528 --> 00:56:14,139
at this point the spaces between the

1167
00:56:13,659 --> 00:56:17,528
notes

1168
00:56:14,139 --> 00:56:19,808
how many distinctly different cannabis

1169
00:56:17,528 --> 00:56:23,259
varieties do you guys say if we were to

1170
00:56:19,809 --> 00:56:24,278
liken cannabis strains to colors and the

1171
00:56:23,259 --> 00:56:26,528
crayon box

1172
00:56:24,278 --> 00:56:29,150
how many crayons would be in that box

1173
00:56:26,528 --> 00:56:32,210
Rob or Sam

1174
00:56:29,150 --> 00:56:35,450
well there's just a couple Kanab basic

1175
00:56:32,210 --> 00:56:38,990
cannabinoids and all the rest of the

1176
00:56:35,449 --> 00:56:42,048
colors are terpenes or the vast majority

1177
00:56:38,989 --> 00:56:44,389
of them so you know figure it out like

1178
00:56:42,048 --> 00:56:48,018
that there's a hundred and forty known

1179
00:56:44,389 --> 00:56:50,778
terpenes but some of them are almost

1180
00:56:48,018 --> 00:56:56,659
just like adding a shimmer rather than a

1181
00:56:50,778 --> 00:56:58,219
real note Thursday then and then I put

1182
00:56:56,659 --> 00:57:00,768
it like this Rob you wrote in

1183
00:56:58,219 --> 00:57:03,108
introduction that the can of Bible there

1184
00:57:00,768 --> 00:57:05,778
was you know less than a dozen plants

1185
00:57:03,108 --> 00:57:09,440
that really ultimately shaped that hope

1186
00:57:05,778 --> 00:57:12,528
the whole breeding profile that the 90s

1187
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:15,048
and it's the 21st century sauce so I

1188
00:57:12,528 --> 00:57:18,079
guess what I'm really asking is how many

1189
00:57:15,048 --> 00:57:20,538
different you know if you will

1190
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:22,730
original strains are we really passing

1191
00:57:20,539 --> 00:57:24,470
around I mean it seem like there isn't

1192
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:26,900
that many you know when you sit there

1193
00:57:24,469 --> 00:57:29,598
and we talked about haze or cush for

1194
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:30,338
trainwreck or if our horse dung or a

1195
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:33,528
Cali Oh

1196
00:57:30,338 --> 00:57:34,818
if the list goes pitch gets kind of

1197
00:57:33,528 --> 00:57:36,768
short is my point

1198
00:57:34,818 --> 00:57:39,588
and I was wondering obviously if you

1199
00:57:36,768 --> 00:57:42,108
guys had actually collected what we know

1200
00:57:39,588 --> 00:57:43,880
as modern cannabis and and and and how

1201
00:57:42,108 --> 00:57:47,858
wide of a selection it really is before

1202
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:50,749
it gets into just a lot of hybridization

1203
00:57:47,858 --> 00:57:53,719
well it's already gotten into a lot of

1204
00:57:50,748 --> 00:57:55,518
hybridization it's already too late from

1205
00:57:53,719 --> 00:57:58,149
that point of view but although there's

1206
00:57:55,518 --> 00:58:01,129
there's several things that are going on

1207
00:57:58,150 --> 00:58:04,579
that are going to allow us to learn more

1208
00:58:01,130 --> 00:58:08,170
about these things and one of those is

1209
00:58:04,579 --> 00:58:11,329
the Philo's bio science project

1210
00:58:08,170 --> 00:58:13,909
salmon are involved with and probably

1211
00:58:11,329 --> 00:58:17,089
mentioned before but with this project

1212
00:58:13,909 --> 00:58:23,538
we're able to at this point they've

1213
00:58:17,088 --> 00:58:25,219
looked at six or seven hundred I don't

1214
00:58:23,539 --> 00:58:27,950
know maybe more by now basically

1215
00:58:25,219 --> 00:58:30,469
dispensary samples from six six states

1216
00:58:27,949 --> 00:58:32,028
thousand of them and they put together a

1217
00:58:30,469 --> 00:58:36,469
model from this okay

1218
00:58:32,028 --> 00:58:43,730
and I had I can't let you see it yet but

1219
00:58:36,469 --> 00:58:49,248
if it comes down to nodes that seem to

1220
00:58:43,730 --> 00:58:51,170
be key parts of varieties there's there

1221
00:58:49,248 --> 00:58:53,899
are it's hard to explain this it's not a

1222
00:58:51,170 --> 00:58:55,970
tree it's more of a they're carotid

1223
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:57,858
related good note yeah they're they're

1224
00:58:55,969 --> 00:58:59,419
some varieties are obviously more

1225
00:58:57,858 --> 00:59:01,369
closely related to each other than they

1226
00:58:59,420 --> 00:59:05,239
are to other ones okay however

1227
00:59:01,369 --> 00:59:07,220
everything is interrelated there's

1228
00:59:05,239 --> 00:59:09,619
there's no little satellite that's not

1229
00:59:07,219 --> 00:59:15,558
related to anything else it's it's a

1230
00:59:09,619 --> 00:59:17,358
giant web and says a lot about with

1231
00:59:15,559 --> 00:59:19,278
varieties these days and how much

1232
00:59:17,358 --> 00:59:27,920
reshuffling of the deck as I leave

1233
00:59:19,278 --> 00:59:30,380
always chasin King's first canna Bible

1234
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:33,440
that the introduction routes called

1235
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:35,720
what's in a name and it's it came out in

1236
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:38,269
two thousand I believe so this is this

1237
00:59:35,719 --> 00:59:41,949
is data that came basically from Sam's

1238
00:59:38,268 --> 00:59:44,868
seed collection seed catalog collection

1239
00:59:41,949 --> 00:59:47,259
from getting everyone there was pretty

1240
00:59:44,869 --> 00:59:50,358
much and and we also knew at that point

1241
00:59:47,259 --> 00:59:53,298
all the major seed company people major

1242
00:59:50,358 --> 00:59:55,248
like six companies so it was easy enough

1243
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:58,429
to ask people if he didn't say in their

1244
00:59:55,248 --> 01:00:00,679
catalog what landraces primarily they'd

1245
00:59:58,429 --> 01:00:03,379
used to make certain varieties and then

1246
01:00:00,679 --> 01:00:05,659
later on which of those varieties they'd

1247
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:09,108
used to make other ones after that point

1248
01:00:05,659 --> 01:00:11,480
in time everything the the business

1249
01:00:09,108 --> 01:00:14,559
became much much larger and basically

1250
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:15,909
people change the names too

1251
01:00:14,559 --> 01:00:19,869
for whatever business reasons they had

1252
01:00:15,909 --> 01:00:22,179
but nobody got any mileage anymore of

1253
01:00:19,869 --> 01:00:24,429
telling people what was really enema

1254
01:00:22,179 --> 01:00:25,899
okay so that's why I published realizing

1255
01:00:24,429 --> 01:00:28,000
this is happening is why I published

1256
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:28,800
that around that time this is 15 years

1257
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,449
ago

1258
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:33,630
since that time certainly new things

1259
01:00:31,449 --> 01:00:37,569
have been brought in that people had

1260
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:39,640
that were not released to anybody back

1261
01:00:37,570 --> 01:00:42,820
in the year 2000 this is something it's

1262
01:00:39,639 --> 01:00:44,799
come up much more recently also so there

1263
01:00:42,820 --> 01:00:46,510
are new land races occasionally the

1264
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:51,150
people have added in certainly in the

1265
01:00:46,510 --> 01:00:53,500
last 15 years the end and all this

1266
01:00:51,150 --> 01:00:55,539
basically people operate on cologne so

1267
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:57,789
people still pop new beans and get new

1268
01:00:55,539 --> 01:01:02,409
materials and see it industry goes on

1269
01:00:57,789 --> 01:01:05,170
but all that stuff basically is highly

1270
01:01:02,409 --> 01:01:07,690
interrelated now when we get to

1271
01:01:05,170 --> 01:01:10,420
analyzing land races in the Philo's

1272
01:01:07,690 --> 01:01:12,309
project then we'll have this cloud which

1273
01:01:10,420 --> 01:01:15,960
would be like two canopy of a tree if

1274
01:01:12,309 --> 01:01:19,360
you want to go back to a more standard

1275
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:22,300
model of lineages and as a family tree

1276
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:25,900
so the land races are the predecessors

1277
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:27,640
of everything we have today okay they

1278
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:29,590
didn't come from outer space they came

1279
01:01:27,639 --> 01:01:33,279
for farmers somewhere and not that long

1280
01:01:29,590 --> 01:01:35,530
ago and we've been able to collect old

1281
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:37,269
dead seeds and leaves from people who

1282
01:01:35,530 --> 01:01:39,400
still have land races and things like

1283
01:01:37,269 --> 01:01:42,309
this and then we're going to be able to

1284
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:45,630
get a lot of the branches of the tree

1285
01:01:42,309 --> 01:01:48,759
that the smaller branches near near this

1286
01:01:45,630 --> 01:01:50,920
canopy of modern-day varieties where it

1287
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:53,530
goes from here evolutionarily is a

1288
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:55,750
really good question this is not a good

1289
01:01:53,530 --> 01:01:58,990
position to be in necessarily for a crop

1290
01:01:55,750 --> 01:02:01,239
plant when it happened to corn there

1291
01:01:58,989 --> 01:02:04,409
were flights that nearly wiped out maize

1292
01:02:01,239 --> 01:02:06,519
anything so there you have it it's

1293
01:02:04,409 --> 01:02:08,440
that's what you can learn we can learn

1294
01:02:06,519 --> 01:02:10,509
more from the Philo's project if anybody

1295
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:13,559
wants to contribute to it I'm not that

1296
01:02:10,510 --> 01:02:15,910
hard to get a hold up so yeah

1297
01:02:13,559 --> 01:02:19,409
participate it's fun science is fun

1298
01:02:15,909 --> 01:02:19,409
don't be afraid of it it's fun

1299
01:02:25,048 --> 01:02:30,940
so take this opportunity I want to ask

1300
01:02:27,639 --> 01:02:32,618
Todd and Rob a combination question

1301
01:02:30,940 --> 01:02:34,450
because I think it goes back to

1302
01:02:32,619 --> 01:02:37,838
something like Mark saying like all I

1303
01:02:34,449 --> 01:02:40,268
got was funky moldy weed when I was a

1304
01:02:37,838 --> 01:02:42,818
teenager and I remember the kind of weed

1305
01:02:40,268 --> 01:02:45,459
I grew up on as a teenager as Jamaican

1306
01:02:42,818 --> 01:02:47,528
import compared to Mexican import now

1307
01:02:45,460 --> 01:02:49,420
when you said like weed only grow

1308
01:02:47,528 --> 01:02:51,969
Hayes's is it because a multitude of

1309
01:02:49,420 --> 01:02:55,000
factors like where you're in the tropics

1310
01:02:51,969 --> 01:02:56,828
these terpenes preserve well I swear

1311
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:59,440
that certain strains because of the

1312
01:02:56,829 --> 01:03:01,809
terpenes they produce they reject mold

1313
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:04,298
and they're more basically are the best

1314
01:03:01,809 --> 01:03:06,910
strains for shipping and transport like

1315
01:03:04,298 --> 01:03:09,068
Todd you've been in all different types

1316
01:03:06,909 --> 01:03:10,960
of situations but there's like a day

1317
01:03:09,068 --> 01:03:14,018
where you don't want to transport the

1318
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:15,730
the stinky stinky skunk but are all were

1319
01:03:14,018 --> 01:03:17,618
there ever strains that you knew you

1320
01:03:15,730 --> 01:03:19,690
could stuff in a bag it would never go

1321
01:03:17,619 --> 01:03:24,108
bad and there were certain genetics that

1322
01:03:19,690 --> 01:03:28,548
those Terps made that strain good for

1323
01:03:24,108 --> 01:03:30,889
well I'll answer first because because I

1324
01:03:28,548 --> 01:03:33,108
have less experience in Rob you know I

1325
01:03:30,889 --> 01:03:37,458
think the handling in learning how to

1326
01:03:33,108 --> 01:03:40,848
handle your canvas is key to what what

1327
01:03:37,458 --> 01:03:42,828
happens to it if it gets moldy when you

1328
01:03:40,849 --> 01:03:44,838
you know fortunately for me I started

1329
01:03:42,829 --> 01:03:47,959
growing cannabis when I was only 13 and

1330
01:03:44,838 --> 01:03:50,630
I had to dry it in order to smoke it

1331
01:03:47,958 --> 01:03:54,048
so I inherently learned how to kind of

1332
01:03:50,630 --> 01:03:57,170
dry it and cure it I mean anything from

1333
01:03:54,048 --> 01:03:59,119
toaster ovens to what eventually ended

1334
01:03:57,170 --> 01:04:01,849
up just being patient and waiting weeks

1335
01:03:59,119 --> 01:04:04,309
for it to cool off and get right but

1336
01:04:01,849 --> 01:04:06,588
once it was right it's still a vegetable

1337
01:04:04,309 --> 01:04:08,209
product and if you put it in a baggie or

1338
01:04:06,588 --> 01:04:10,728
you put it somewhere and you're not

1339
01:04:08,208 --> 01:04:13,909
conscious of its humidity you can cause

1340
01:04:10,728 --> 01:04:16,428
it to mold up pretty easily I'm so

1341
01:04:13,909 --> 01:04:19,219
handling it to me is what you're talking

1342
01:04:16,429 --> 01:04:21,559
about ratio there's no strains because

1343
01:04:19,219 --> 01:04:23,869
it depends on the variety at the time of

1344
01:04:21,559 --> 01:04:26,420
its moisture you know what I mean like

1345
01:04:23,869 --> 01:04:28,130
all of these factors are working into

1346
01:04:26,420 --> 01:04:32,739
the conversation you know but are there

1347
01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:32,739
mold resistant varieties Rob

1348
01:04:36,088 --> 01:04:44,809
rob is muted can you unmute Rob so spoil

1349
01:04:41,108 --> 01:04:53,090
needed stuff okay privacy

1350
01:04:44,809 --> 01:04:53,090
can hear your now rub wood okay um

1351
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:58,529
there are certainly susceptible roads

1352
01:04:55,800 --> 01:05:03,600
that's what we deal with today with this

1353
01:04:58,530 --> 01:05:07,650
modern poly hybrid gene pool that we

1354
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:11,389
have all the varieties we have now

1355
01:05:07,650 --> 01:05:13,910
contain at least a smut smattering or

1356
01:05:11,389 --> 01:05:17,549
actually rather large percentage of

1357
01:05:13,909 --> 01:05:20,639
Afghan backgrounds ok the broadleaf drug

1358
01:05:17,550 --> 01:05:24,120
varieties cannabis indica subspecies

1359
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:24,420
Afghan occur whatever you want to call

1360
01:05:24,119 --> 01:05:29,339
it

1361
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:33,980
and these indicas as people call them

1362
01:05:29,340 --> 01:05:35,970
and they are indeed one indica are

1363
01:05:33,980 --> 01:05:37,860
predominant in a lot of the varieties

1364
01:05:35,969 --> 01:05:40,909
they have today and what they brought us

1365
01:05:37,860 --> 01:05:42,990
is an extreme susceptibility to mold

1366
01:05:40,909 --> 01:05:45,929
Afghanistan is a dry place there is no

1367
01:05:42,989 --> 01:05:48,029
reason for for a varieties to develop a

1368
01:05:45,929 --> 01:05:52,649
natural resistance to mold they just

1369
01:05:48,030 --> 01:05:55,080
wasn't an issue so before this time we

1370
01:05:52,650 --> 01:05:58,410
have varieties from Mexico and and

1371
01:05:55,079 --> 01:06:00,929
Jamaica and Colombia and and Thailand

1372
01:05:58,409 --> 01:06:04,739
and all these were descendant from an

1373
01:06:00,929 --> 01:06:07,649
Indian gene pool okay narrow leaf bred

1374
01:06:04,739 --> 01:06:11,879
varieties that true indica subspecies

1375
01:06:07,650 --> 01:06:15,570
indica and they came from semi-tropical

1376
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:17,519
in tropical areas and and mountain areas

1377
01:06:15,570 --> 01:06:21,930
but places that had a considerable

1378
01:06:17,519 --> 01:06:25,679
amount of range and for them a natural

1379
01:06:21,929 --> 01:06:30,029
resistance to infection by mold zzz's

1380
01:06:25,679 --> 01:06:33,839
was a selective advantage so we had

1381
01:06:30,030 --> 01:06:35,910
plans to matured considerably later than

1382
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:37,559
the modern-day Harvard's but they

1383
01:06:35,909 --> 01:06:39,929
weren't really susceptible to mold

1384
01:06:37,559 --> 01:06:41,849
there's a subtle other things and if you

1385
01:06:39,929 --> 01:06:45,029
treated him badly they could get mold I

1386
01:06:41,849 --> 01:06:47,369
mean you know that but you had to treat

1387
01:06:45,030 --> 01:06:49,830
him real badly instead of coddling them

1388
01:06:47,369 --> 01:06:52,589
all the time and they have mold like

1389
01:06:49,829 --> 01:06:54,750
today's varieties that that's that's

1390
01:06:52,590 --> 01:06:58,570
again the genetic background historical

1391
01:06:54,750 --> 01:07:01,510
background for what we see today and and

1392
01:06:58,570 --> 01:07:03,250
yeah it's in everything today pretty

1393
01:07:01,510 --> 01:07:10,150
much unless you have a variety that's

1394
01:07:03,250 --> 01:07:12,190
that's pre pre Afghan I guess the reason

1395
01:07:10,150 --> 01:07:15,039
why I wonder like I have a bunch of

1396
01:07:12,190 --> 01:07:18,010
plants and veg and I created a condition

1397
01:07:15,039 --> 01:07:21,219
in which they got infected with mold

1398
01:07:18,010 --> 01:07:23,650
from a maple tree and I watched as I'm

1399
01:07:21,219 --> 01:07:25,719
like this is the plants with the highest

1400
01:07:23,650 --> 01:07:28,150
you could say stem Rob terpene

1401
01:07:25,719 --> 01:07:30,730
production seemed to be the least

1402
01:07:28,150 --> 01:07:32,349
effective and I know that's a genetic

1403
01:07:30,730 --> 01:07:35,110
trait but I'm just looking at the

1404
01:07:32,349 --> 01:07:37,360
surface area of a plant a mold and the

1405
01:07:35,110 --> 01:07:39,970
types of terpenes that would be on those

1406
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:42,519
micro trichomes that are available in

1407
01:07:39,969 --> 01:07:44,109
veg and when I look up those strains I'm

1408
01:07:42,519 --> 01:07:47,079
like okay high-end limonene and I know

1409
01:07:44,110 --> 01:07:48,670
Lehman in his antifungal is that some of

1410
01:07:47,079 --> 01:07:49,690
that attribute where I go over to the

1411
01:07:48,670 --> 01:07:51,700
next rain I'm like this is getting

1412
01:07:49,690 --> 01:07:53,530
destroyed and I rubbed the stem and I'm

1413
01:07:51,699 --> 01:07:56,409
like it smells like nothing I'm not

1414
01:07:53,530 --> 01:07:58,510
saying it's a universal quality but when

1415
01:07:56,409 --> 01:08:00,849
I found the weed that smelled the most

1416
01:07:58,510 --> 01:08:04,330
like my dad's Jamaican compressed brick

1417
01:08:00,849 --> 01:08:07,360
weed it was a very peppery spicy version

1418
01:08:04,329 --> 01:08:09,279
of Master Kush and seems that that

1419
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:11,500
preservation in that resistance that

1420
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:13,600
conditions where you can press the [ __ ]

1421
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:15,219
out of it into a brick stuff him in

1422
01:08:13,599 --> 01:08:17,470
suitcase and then send it on a boat for

1423
01:08:15,219 --> 01:08:20,099
three weeks it seems to always come back

1424
01:08:17,470 --> 01:08:22,298
to a peppery terpene or a more sativa

1425
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:24,100
basically that same thing I only grow

1426
01:08:22,298 --> 01:08:26,769
sativas I don't know much about indicas

1427
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:29,980
but the tuna cush to the beating yeah I

1428
01:08:26,770 --> 01:08:32,589
would suggest that the peppery taste

1429
01:08:29,979 --> 01:08:36,278
this remaining is what's left after the

1430
01:08:32,588 --> 01:08:40,059
throwing for some reason half-laughs

1431
01:08:36,279 --> 01:08:44,740
again well I just can't hear you no I

1432
01:08:40,060 --> 01:08:47,880
can hear you Rob you're not okay oh [ __ ]

1433
01:08:44,739 --> 01:08:47,880
it was my headphone sorry

1434
01:08:48,009 --> 01:08:52,449
I'm sure he'll agree markets it's what

1435
01:08:50,350 --> 01:08:54,730
was left over and your dad's Jamaican

1436
01:08:52,449 --> 01:08:59,649
not just respect and Tenant but it was

1437
01:08:54,729 --> 01:09:02,439
what wasn't cooked out of it in transit

1438
01:08:59,649 --> 01:09:04,420
and and in drying and everything else it

1439
01:09:02,439 --> 01:09:06,818
it's what's left it's it's the

1440
01:09:04,420 --> 01:09:09,159
commonality of cannabis that we found in

1441
01:09:06,819 --> 01:09:11,140
lots of important things back in the day

1442
01:09:09,159 --> 01:09:13,659
in different varieties left behind

1443
01:09:11,140 --> 01:09:16,210
different characteristic flavors but

1444
01:09:13,659 --> 01:09:18,369
it's what it's what we didn't really

1445
01:09:16,210 --> 01:09:20,048
learn about until he grew seeds from

1446
01:09:18,369 --> 01:09:22,809
those like you're doing you know then

1447
01:09:20,048 --> 01:09:25,149
you you see the terpenes that didn't get

1448
01:09:22,810 --> 01:09:27,190
boiled out in transit or handling earth

1449
01:09:25,149 --> 01:09:29,528
any other processing that ever happens

1450
01:09:27,189 --> 01:09:32,139
so you know the sesqui turkey and some

1451
01:09:29,529 --> 01:09:34,830
of the the lower boiling point ones are

1452
01:09:32,140 --> 01:09:38,440
what's left in bay to carry out lean

1453
01:09:34,829 --> 01:09:40,119
mean human lean carry awfully knock side

1454
01:09:38,439 --> 01:09:56,819
yeah those are the ones usually that

1455
01:09:40,119 --> 01:09:56,819
give that that peppery anybody smoking

1456
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:12,640
you ever used terpenes to flavor your

1457
01:10:08,229 --> 01:10:15,699
bomb water no but I've used what are

1458
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:18,369
those things bombers you know copper

1459
01:10:15,699 --> 01:10:21,099
limes for fear lines so these are leaves

1460
01:10:18,369 --> 01:10:23,260
and Thai cooking right okay

1461
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:24,670
there's fruits to grow on these things I

1462
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:27,460
just happen to have a friend who has one

1463
01:10:24,670 --> 01:10:29,560
in their yard and they're really

1464
01:10:27,460 --> 01:10:31,569
limonene rich these things are just

1465
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:33,550
they're just a peel basically it's

1466
01:10:31,569 --> 01:10:35,799
hardly anything inside there's nothing

1467
01:10:33,550 --> 01:10:38,020
you do that except chop it in small

1468
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:40,900
pieces and fill your wrong with them

1469
01:10:38,020 --> 01:10:43,000
like putting ice in your bong it's a

1470
01:10:40,899 --> 01:10:47,319
really great thing to do with old scale

1471
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:49,329
weed I learned this a long time ago this

1472
01:10:47,319 --> 01:10:51,549
is really good this is that terpene

1473
01:10:49,329 --> 01:10:55,479
enhanced I think primarily limonene is

1474
01:10:51,550 --> 01:11:01,869
all sweet a citrusy stuff in and they

1475
01:10:55,479 --> 01:11:05,199
were three yes yeah I recently did a

1476
01:11:01,869 --> 01:11:08,260
couple dabs with my friend Dave Malone

1477
01:11:05,199 --> 01:11:11,979
from green dot there in Boulder Colorado

1478
01:11:08,260 --> 01:11:15,100
and he flavored the bong water with a

1479
01:11:11,979 --> 01:11:17,439
little bit of lemongrass oil was like a

1480
01:11:15,100 --> 01:11:20,320
completely different dad did adapt

1481
01:11:17,439 --> 01:11:22,809
before and a dab after very very

1482
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:24,420
different you know it's interesting

1483
01:11:22,810 --> 01:11:27,820
we're talking about this because back in

1484
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:30,359
2003 I opened a gallery in Vancouver

1485
01:11:27,819 --> 01:11:33,069
called the melting point and I had a

1486
01:11:30,359 --> 01:11:35,519
vaporization station it was actually

1487
01:11:33,069 --> 01:11:38,109
called the inhalation station of

1488
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:40,690
vaporization and it was about 20 plus

1489
01:11:38,109 --> 01:11:42,269
feet long and I had a variety of you

1490
01:11:40,689 --> 01:11:44,199
know all the different top-quality

1491
01:11:42,270 --> 01:11:46,780
vaporizers that were available at the

1492
01:11:44,199 --> 01:11:50,170
time you know the aeromed from Germany

1493
01:11:46,779 --> 01:11:52,029
and the volcano and rip tech was there

1494
01:11:50,170 --> 01:11:53,680
and the volatize er was there there was

1495
01:11:52,029 --> 01:11:55,809
a whole variety of these things and

1496
01:11:53,680 --> 01:11:58,180
because it was so early and really there

1497
01:11:55,810 --> 01:12:00,340
was a one compassion Club exist and it

1498
01:11:58,180 --> 01:12:02,380
was still very young we had no real

1499
01:12:00,340 --> 01:12:04,569
regulations or rules it was completely

1500
01:12:02,380 --> 01:12:06,130
not allowed and I kind of pushed the

1501
01:12:04,569 --> 01:12:07,569
boundaries and I just said well you know

1502
01:12:06,130 --> 01:12:09,850
what I'll let people bring their herbs

1503
01:12:07,569 --> 01:12:13,259
and use these vaporizers and sit at it

1504
01:12:09,850 --> 01:12:19,090
and set it up but I also what I did was

1505
01:12:13,260 --> 01:12:21,940
we acquired other essential oil

1506
01:12:19,090 --> 01:12:24,699
secreting herbs that were medicinal and

1507
01:12:21,939 --> 01:12:26,289
like lavender and you know like just

1508
01:12:24,699 --> 01:12:29,050
different things that were right right

1509
01:12:26,289 --> 01:12:30,609
next door to my store and we had people

1510
01:12:29,050 --> 01:12:32,199
come and invade these different things

1511
01:12:30,609 --> 01:12:35,199
and eventually people started bringing

1512
01:12:32,199 --> 01:12:36,970
in like pure essential oils and you take

1513
01:12:35,199 --> 01:12:39,819
like the tiniest little like my new

1514
01:12:36,970 --> 01:12:41,860
little drop of like mint and it was the

1515
01:12:39,819 --> 01:12:44,199
most uplifting you couldn't even believe

1516
01:12:41,859 --> 01:12:46,689
like some of these things were literally

1517
01:12:44,199 --> 01:12:49,029
giving people the effects being of being

1518
01:12:46,689 --> 01:12:53,859
high but in a different way from a

1519
01:12:49,029 --> 01:12:56,739
completely different plant oh and you

1520
01:12:53,859 --> 01:13:01,949
know damn near 12 years ago that we were

1521
01:12:56,739 --> 01:13:05,439
doing that at the old melting point

1522
01:13:01,949 --> 01:13:12,729
yeah mint ash someone just said what's

1523
01:13:05,439 --> 01:13:15,460
that yeah Roma therapy you know about to

1524
01:13:12,729 --> 01:13:18,250
say is listening to myself well how

1525
01:13:15,460 --> 01:13:20,079
about any Polonia but you know Rob you

1526
01:13:18,250 --> 01:13:22,989
were one of the few researchers that got

1527
01:13:20,079 --> 01:13:24,970
you know you and Adrian and Rob are the

1528
01:13:22,989 --> 01:13:27,670
few people that literally got into the

1529
01:13:24,970 --> 01:13:30,789
whole can of the scene and and and you

1530
01:13:27,670 --> 01:13:33,190
know it amazes me that you know more of

1531
01:13:30,789 --> 01:13:35,929
us in this don't don't go the way of the

1532
01:13:33,189 --> 01:13:37,669
of what you've done with him and

1533
01:13:35,929 --> 01:13:40,719
you know what kind of caused you to get

1534
01:13:37,670 --> 01:13:44,118
so what caused you that's such a broad

1535
01:13:40,719 --> 01:13:48,489
look at cannabis as opposed to just

1536
01:13:44,118 --> 01:13:48,488
being into the stuff that gets us high

1537
01:13:51,880 --> 01:14:00,800
they were legal they're too legal yeah

1538
01:13:54,948 --> 01:14:03,018
it's illegal hobby and it's it's one the

1539
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:05,979
travel as well Jake she's interesting

1540
01:14:03,019 --> 01:14:10,489
places but it all started really I guess

1541
01:14:05,979 --> 01:14:13,369
because of thing of all the nature texts

1542
01:14:10,488 --> 01:14:16,158
and going to China and seeing a hemp

1543
01:14:13,368 --> 01:14:18,589
textile mill and then having time off in

1544
01:14:16,158 --> 01:14:19,938
China and you a little bit about 10

1545
01:14:18,590 --> 01:14:22,610
things already from Hungary

1546
01:14:19,939 --> 01:14:24,380
you know things made in villages for

1547
01:14:22,609 --> 01:14:28,098
people we've collected things there but

1548
01:14:24,380 --> 01:14:32,958
it was more like finding linens you know

1549
01:14:28,099 --> 01:14:35,090
it wasn't wasn't too exciting but still

1550
01:14:32,958 --> 01:14:38,149
part of the picture then I went on my

1551
01:14:35,090 --> 01:14:40,729
phone vacations at first Yunnan Province

1552
01:14:38,149 --> 01:14:42,708
in China not where I worked at all but

1553
01:14:40,729 --> 01:14:45,679
where there are a lot of minority ethnic

1554
01:14:42,708 --> 01:14:47,809
groups and I actually saw people wearing

1555
01:14:45,679 --> 01:14:49,609
things they said were made from him

1556
01:14:47,809 --> 01:14:54,590
and this was right about the time when

1557
01:14:49,609 --> 01:14:58,219
the some of the Hmong batik dyed indigo

1558
01:14:54,590 --> 01:15:02,569
batik dyed skirts and scraps from were

1559
01:14:58,219 --> 01:15:04,429
being used to make purses and bags and

1560
01:15:02,569 --> 01:15:06,799
things and that they were showing up

1561
01:15:04,429 --> 01:15:09,769
enough to have carrots and things early

1562
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:11,420
ones those so that was thought to pique

1563
01:15:09,769 --> 01:15:13,639
my interest to be in if and I just never

1564
01:15:11,420 --> 01:15:15,319
looked back I started finding different

1565
01:15:13,639 --> 01:15:17,748
more and more different cultures that

1566
01:15:15,319 --> 01:15:20,988
had used temp for a long long time and

1567
01:15:17,748 --> 01:15:23,569
in in different ways but primarily

1568
01:15:20,988 --> 01:15:24,978
through their texels through their

1569
01:15:23,569 --> 01:15:28,969
weeding that's the thing I'm the most

1570
01:15:24,979 --> 01:15:30,860
interested and you know obviously your

1571
01:15:28,969 --> 01:15:33,019
career brought you to cannabis I mean

1572
01:15:30,859 --> 01:15:35,988
anyone who's picked it up is amazed with

1573
01:15:33,019 --> 01:15:38,150
that body of work and uh you know I'm

1574
01:15:35,988 --> 01:15:39,859
just utterly fascinated with the history

1575
01:15:38,149 --> 01:15:42,828
of cannabis and no one's ever brought it

1576
01:15:39,859 --> 01:15:46,908
together quite like you and Mark do in

1577
01:15:42,828 --> 01:15:49,639
your latest book and you know I write

1578
01:15:46,908 --> 01:15:52,039
books or I try to I can't imagine

1579
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:53,990
experience that and I was just wondering

1580
01:15:52,039 --> 01:15:56,569
how long did it take you to write you

1581
01:15:53,989 --> 01:15:59,059
know how do you you know how did you

1582
01:15:56,569 --> 01:16:01,429
guys how did you come up with cannabis

1583
01:15:59,060 --> 01:16:07,640
evolution and that's no botany if you

1584
01:16:01,430 --> 01:16:09,680
don't mind me asking would be almost

1585
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:11,660
twenty years ago now 19 years ago that

1586
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:14,810
boom mark and I finally met each other

1587
01:16:11,659 --> 01:16:18,409
Mark had written his dissertation his

1588
01:16:14,810 --> 01:16:22,250
master's just dissertation on cannabis

1589
01:16:18,409 --> 01:16:26,710
and it was called man and marijuana came

1590
01:16:22,250 --> 01:16:26,710
out in would that have been 72 I guess

1591
01:16:27,010 --> 01:16:35,390
yes

1592
01:16:29,229 --> 01:16:38,559
and through that I wrote up in 1976 I

1593
01:16:35,390 --> 01:16:42,530
came up with a my way to get out of

1594
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:44,900
undergraduate education and published my

1595
01:16:42,529 --> 01:16:46,609
honors thesis my honors dissertation

1596
01:16:44,899 --> 01:16:48,949
which is called a botany in ecology of

1597
01:16:46,609 --> 01:16:50,750
cannabis my inspiration when I went to

1598
01:16:48,949 --> 01:16:52,369
the library is funny Mark's book no keep

1599
01:16:50,750 --> 01:16:54,739
it at it Santa Barbara where I could do

1600
01:16:52,369 --> 01:16:58,130
it at Santa Cruz we correspondent ever

1601
01:16:54,739 --> 01:17:01,659
since and finally met at a time you for

1602
01:16:58,130 --> 01:17:05,569
ethanol a society for economic botany me

1603
01:17:01,659 --> 01:17:07,819
economic botany society is uh basically

1604
01:17:05,569 --> 01:17:09,439
a group of ethno botanist economic

1605
01:17:07,819 --> 01:17:12,079
botany is what we used to call the field

1606
01:17:09,439 --> 01:17:14,149
before ethnobotany really was that the

1607
01:17:12,079 --> 01:17:16,909
botany of plants that impinged on the

1608
01:17:14,149 --> 01:17:19,460
economics of humans became a lot more

1609
01:17:16,909 --> 01:17:21,559
than that it became the study of humans

1610
01:17:19,460 --> 01:17:25,539
and the plants they use in those

1611
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:29,150
relationships all sorts of words so

1612
01:17:25,539 --> 01:17:31,369
through that vehicle if you will that

1613
01:17:29,149 --> 01:17:33,710
investigative tool death no botany which

1614
01:17:31,369 --> 01:17:35,930
mark was already experienced with he's

1615
01:17:33,710 --> 01:17:37,760
10 years my senior and a professor at

1616
01:17:35,930 --> 01:17:42,079
the University of Hawaii teaches the

1617
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:45,350
subject um we decided to do the book I'd

1618
01:17:42,079 --> 01:17:47,180
already had a experience for my graduate

1619
01:17:45,350 --> 01:17:49,550
work I had things left from that that I

1620
01:17:47,180 --> 01:17:52,100
wanted to publish and we set off on this

1621
01:17:49,550 --> 01:17:53,510
grand project to write this book we

1622
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:57,410
figured it'd take a few years and we'd

1623
01:17:53,510 --> 01:18:00,650
publish it well 17 years later just a

1624
01:17:57,409 --> 01:18:02,889
couple years ago this month we finished

1625
01:18:00,649 --> 01:18:06,279
we finished it

1626
01:18:02,890 --> 01:18:08,740
and I guess if we know it's going to

1627
01:18:06,279 --> 01:18:11,409
take so long we never would have tackled

1628
01:18:08,739 --> 01:18:16,029
it it just seems too long at the time

1629
01:18:11,409 --> 01:18:19,949
but when you look back at least but we

1630
01:18:16,029 --> 01:18:25,389
did it and it just was a growing growing

1631
01:18:19,949 --> 01:18:30,159
project probably half the 700 plus

1632
01:18:25,390 --> 01:18:31,869
citations came to us after we got well

1633
01:18:30,159 --> 01:18:35,939
after we get stern a lot of them in the

1634
01:18:31,869 --> 01:18:37,989
last 10 years last half the front and

1635
01:18:35,939 --> 01:18:39,369
you just keep getting more and more

1636
01:18:37,989 --> 01:18:44,510
information we're trying to be

1637
01:18:39,369 --> 01:18:48,050
comprehensive it's we wanted to have

1638
01:18:44,510 --> 01:18:50,239
a reference book published by Academic

1639
01:18:48,050 --> 01:18:53,380
Press and University of California Press

1640
01:18:50,239 --> 01:18:57,260
has done this and we appreciate that and

1641
01:18:53,380 --> 01:18:58,850
I think people feel to credible body of

1642
01:18:57,260 --> 01:19:03,050
knowledge I'd like it to have more

1643
01:18:58,850 --> 01:19:05,990
exposure mark uses anyway so uh they're

1644
01:19:03,050 --> 01:19:07,670
taking ideas for getting this body of

1645
01:19:05,989 --> 01:19:09,769
knowledge optimal people is there a

1646
01:19:07,670 --> 01:19:11,600
syllabus written around this book and is

1647
01:19:09,770 --> 01:19:14,240
this the book that will be used in

1648
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:17,450
colleges when you know a cannabis course

1649
01:19:14,239 --> 01:19:19,609
is offered I think that most naturally

1650
01:19:17,449 --> 01:19:22,340
cannabis evolution and that's no Barney

1651
01:19:19,609 --> 01:19:24,979
will most definitely be the book that is

1652
01:19:22,340 --> 01:19:26,569
the required reading or the and and is

1653
01:19:24,979 --> 01:19:29,569
this already in practice is this

1654
01:19:26,569 --> 01:19:31,460
something that you're working on well

1655
01:19:29,569 --> 01:19:33,349
I'd like to see a curriculum build I'd

1656
01:19:31,460 --> 01:19:36,039
like to see it a lot more simplified

1657
01:19:33,350 --> 01:19:41,660
than all a massive information that's in

1658
01:19:36,039 --> 01:19:43,220
cannabis but yet it is a project I'm not

1659
01:19:41,659 --> 01:19:47,090
actively working on but I really would

1660
01:19:43,220 --> 01:19:49,340
like to be in it's uh it would take an

1661
01:19:47,090 --> 01:19:52,909
educator it would taking it an editor

1662
01:19:49,340 --> 01:19:54,770
would take someone who knows how to pare

1663
01:19:52,909 --> 01:19:57,590
down what's there and get the essential

1664
01:19:54,770 --> 01:20:01,400
bits into a form that appeals to people

1665
01:19:57,590 --> 01:20:04,190
today who want to learn which is largely

1666
01:20:01,399 --> 01:20:06,289
be online I would respectfully see how

1667
01:20:04,189 --> 01:20:08,949
much of a future in trying to to write

1668
01:20:06,289 --> 01:20:11,750
books except for sentimental reasons

1669
01:20:08,949 --> 01:20:13,489
well you know people are still reading

1670
01:20:11,750 --> 01:20:15,680
even though they're not reading per se

1671
01:20:13,489 --> 01:20:17,239
books I mean we're you know just because

1672
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:19,159
they're electronically deliberate

1673
01:20:17,239 --> 01:20:21,199
information it's still fonts it's still

1674
01:20:19,159 --> 01:20:23,539
words it's still thoughts it's it's

1675
01:20:21,199 --> 01:20:25,220
still the same thing you know not to you

1676
01:20:23,539 --> 01:20:28,100
know Shakespeare Shakespeare Shakespeare

1677
01:20:25,220 --> 01:20:29,810
so to speak and that you're conveying a

1678
01:20:28,100 --> 01:20:31,760
lot of information and people who are

1679
01:20:29,810 --> 01:20:33,710
able to bring it in and know more than

1680
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:36,079
ever I would say you know please write

1681
01:20:33,710 --> 01:20:38,270
more don't write less because you know

1682
01:20:36,079 --> 01:20:40,550
contributions like marijuana botany had

1683
01:20:38,270 --> 01:20:43,580
a big impact if it wasn't for authors

1684
01:20:40,550 --> 01:20:45,230
like you and Mel Frank I never ever

1685
01:20:43,579 --> 01:20:47,210
cleaned out my closet and started

1686
01:20:45,229 --> 01:20:49,459
growing cannabis if I had not found a

1687
01:20:47,210 --> 01:20:51,770
Mel Frank grow book and that's just my

1688
01:20:49,460 --> 01:20:53,899
reality and for you know for me to

1689
01:20:51,770 --> 01:20:55,700
stumble upon later your your

1690
01:20:53,899 --> 01:20:57,859
contribution marijuana botany I was

1691
01:20:55,699 --> 01:21:00,019
amazed at that and did

1692
01:20:57,859 --> 01:21:02,630
the way these were these were the

1693
01:21:00,020 --> 01:21:05,090
pebbles in the river for me to step on

1694
01:21:02,630 --> 01:21:06,829
as I walked across and learned in and I

1695
01:21:05,090 --> 01:21:10,159
wish you guys would write more honestly

1696
01:21:06,829 --> 01:21:12,019
uh truthfully I do and and I and I and

1697
01:21:10,158 --> 01:21:14,059
you know even publish it you know

1698
01:21:12,020 --> 01:21:16,040
shorter papers get right to the point

1699
01:21:14,060 --> 01:21:17,449
I mean you know now you don't have to go

1700
01:21:16,039 --> 01:21:19,670
through publishing houses you know I

1701
01:21:17,448 --> 01:21:22,339
have to wait for four big books I mean

1702
01:21:19,670 --> 01:21:25,219
in my opinion people like you like Mel

1703
01:21:22,340 --> 01:21:27,770
Frank you have if you will a literary

1704
01:21:25,219 --> 01:21:30,050
following where we are interested in the

1705
01:21:27,770 --> 01:21:32,030
stuff you're learning I get to get it

1706
01:21:30,050 --> 01:21:35,060
firsthand because fortunately you like

1707
01:21:32,029 --> 01:21:37,309
me but but the rest of the world too

1708
01:21:35,060 --> 01:21:39,889
would benefit from the work you do and

1709
01:21:37,310 --> 01:21:42,980
even if it's not these huge three

1710
01:21:39,889 --> 01:21:45,409
hundred and fifty thousand word 17-year

1711
01:21:42,979 --> 01:21:47,569
projects but you know much shorter

1712
01:21:45,408 --> 01:21:50,149
projects about the fascinating terpenes

1713
01:21:47,569 --> 01:21:52,009
and chemistry and and other elements of

1714
01:21:50,149 --> 01:21:55,158
cannabis that are all interconnected

1715
01:21:52,010 --> 01:21:57,199
right now that we're learning about in

1716
01:21:55,158 --> 01:21:58,969
society because everybody's learning

1717
01:21:57,198 --> 01:22:03,710
right now through their smartphones in

1718
01:21:58,969 --> 01:22:05,630
my opinion the news is coming in that's

1719
01:22:03,710 --> 01:22:08,770
what I'm getting out of the way to get

1720
01:22:05,630 --> 01:22:11,569
information out there whatever it takes

1721
01:22:08,770 --> 01:22:12,889
we're doing it I mean I can't because

1722
01:22:11,569 --> 01:22:15,710
I'm hearing and I'm like yeah you know a

1723
01:22:12,889 --> 01:22:18,529
good five page article on that subject

1724
01:22:15,710 --> 01:22:21,170
of these terpenes or why would we pick

1725
01:22:18,529 --> 01:22:23,029
that strain or what Jen there every

1726
01:22:21,170 --> 01:22:25,368
different subject we've jumped on is all

1727
01:22:23,029 --> 01:22:27,859
a kick-ass five-page article that you

1728
01:22:25,368 --> 01:22:30,229
could just go in deep on you know like

1729
01:22:27,859 --> 01:22:31,939
Sam discovering the terpenes then Sam

1730
01:22:30,229 --> 01:22:38,029
being is what you guys having access to

1731
01:22:31,939 --> 01:22:40,279
THC a no I was with me yes like you guys

1732
01:22:38,029 --> 01:22:41,868
doing that now let's say we looking at

1733
01:22:40,279 --> 01:22:42,948
me and bubbleman and we're [ __ ] with

1734
01:22:41,868 --> 01:22:45,289
the same thing

1735
01:22:42,948 --> 01:22:47,000
what would your article be on like when

1736
01:22:45,289 --> 01:22:48,738
you discover it what would you like to

1737
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:50,658
see us do where would you like to see us

1738
01:22:48,738 --> 01:22:52,908
go like I know where I'm going in

1739
01:22:50,658 --> 01:22:56,629
exploring the strain not being the

1740
01:22:52,908 --> 01:22:59,000
strain by isolating the wet terpenes the

1741
01:22:56,630 --> 01:23:01,400
ones that disappear when they dry and

1742
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:04,399
seeing if they modulate the strain and a

1743
01:23:01,399 --> 01:23:06,049
whole different profile but do you guys

1744
01:23:04,399 --> 01:23:08,420
ever have things like that where you

1745
01:23:06,050 --> 01:23:11,610
want to see like I want to deceive mid

1746
01:23:08,420 --> 01:23:13,618
THC a helped standardize cannabis for

1747
01:23:11,609 --> 01:23:17,399
hey even if it wasn't exciting for

1748
01:23:13,618 --> 01:23:19,229
everything else heck there's lots of

1749
01:23:17,399 --> 01:23:22,670
interesting things people can still do

1750
01:23:19,229 --> 01:23:24,539
it's uh probably more than ever really

1751
01:23:22,670 --> 01:23:28,199
lots of possibilities

1752
01:23:24,539 --> 01:23:33,118
Marcel deal wit at Mary farm I think has

1753
01:23:28,198 --> 01:23:37,309
a patent for using THC a for most

1754
01:23:33,118 --> 01:23:39,779
medical applications I believe so no

1755
01:23:37,310 --> 01:23:42,750
interesting to see it wouldn't hold up

1756
01:23:39,779 --> 01:23:44,670
in an infringement case to those so you

1757
01:23:42,750 --> 01:23:46,859
go ahead and patent it all you want it's

1758
01:23:44,670 --> 01:23:48,929
not worth the paper it's written on

1759
01:23:46,859 --> 01:23:51,839
thank you mark you just gave me the

1760
01:23:48,929 --> 01:23:57,840
go-ahead to he's using THC aid to treat

1761
01:23:51,840 --> 01:24:00,869
pain anything that's obvious and for

1762
01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:05,639
dozens of years what I've been doing is

1763
01:24:00,868 --> 01:24:09,029
taking all my THC a Raisa and converting

1764
01:24:05,639 --> 01:24:23,579
it to THC so that it was not breaking

1765
01:24:09,029 --> 01:24:28,019
anybody's path over the world I'll dab

1766
01:24:23,579 --> 01:24:33,960
to that can't patent something that's

1767
01:24:28,020 --> 01:24:37,949
known and obvious it's use patent it's a

1768
01:24:33,960 --> 01:24:40,469
medical use patent it's not a THC a I it

1769
01:24:37,948 --> 01:24:43,289
doesn't make a difference the use is

1770
01:24:40,469 --> 01:24:45,569
obvious it's known it won't hold up in

1771
01:24:43,289 --> 01:24:47,310
an infringement Court case of

1772
01:24:45,569 --> 01:24:49,289
infringement against that patent which

1773
01:24:47,310 --> 01:24:58,920
is why you don't see it them suing

1774
01:24:49,289 --> 01:25:01,649
anybody I've worked with last 25 years

1775
01:24:58,920 --> 01:25:04,139
I'm not a patent weird but I have a lot

1776
01:25:01,649 --> 01:25:06,750
of patents and I know I know what it

1777
01:25:04,139 --> 01:25:07,800
takes to get a patent and you know you

1778
01:25:06,750 --> 01:25:09,840
can get a patent

1779
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:13,429
well that doesn't mean that it's gonna

1780
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:13,429
hold up in an infringement case

1781
01:25:19,448 --> 01:25:24,019
that's definitely true

1782
01:25:22,340 --> 01:25:25,460
the best thing you should do is that if

1783
01:25:24,020 --> 01:25:27,380
you come up with something that's cool

1784
01:25:25,460 --> 01:25:29,689
rather than patent it just do what the

1785
01:25:27,380 --> 01:25:31,789
folks at coca-cola did keep it a trade

1786
01:25:29,689 --> 01:25:34,779
secret keep it a secret that only you

1787
01:25:31,789 --> 01:25:37,850
know about and then then you'll be okay

1788
01:25:34,779 --> 01:25:48,139
that's the type of intellectual property

1789
01:25:37,850 --> 01:25:50,210
you having cannabis trade secret banding

1790
01:25:48,140 --> 01:25:52,280
I guess you call a brand if you

1791
01:25:50,210 --> 01:25:54,380
trademark a brand or if you have a

1792
01:25:52,279 --> 01:25:56,569
branded trademark that's also a form of

1793
01:25:54,380 --> 01:25:58,640
intellectual property but getting

1794
01:25:56,569 --> 01:26:01,279
patents especially just around cannabis

1795
01:25:58,640 --> 01:26:04,010
or the constituents of cannabis I mean

1796
01:26:01,279 --> 01:26:05,569
you could come up with an end use patent

1797
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:11,210
or come up with something that you think

1798
01:26:05,569 --> 01:26:13,279
is is new and off and not obvious what

1799
01:26:11,210 --> 01:26:15,289
chances are it's already been

1800
01:26:13,279 --> 01:26:17,539
demonstrated and if it's already been

1801
01:26:15,289 --> 01:26:22,640
demonstrated it's not novel and if it's

1802
01:26:17,539 --> 01:26:27,100
not novel it can't be an invention okay

1803
01:26:22,640 --> 01:26:27,100
so when did you start working on hashish

1804
01:26:28,869 --> 01:26:40,689
okay you were here yesterday I mean I

1805
01:26:36,920 --> 01:26:42,800
him California in Indiana before I

1806
01:26:40,689 --> 01:26:45,769
wouldn't grad school before I moved to

1807
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:48,199
John Stehr dump but yeah when I got here

1808
01:26:45,770 --> 01:26:51,760
when I moved into a hash culture slow we

1809
01:26:48,198 --> 01:26:54,439
didn't in California but here there's a

1810
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:56,630
hashish culture

1811
01:26:54,439 --> 01:26:58,129
it was the dominant deal yeah but they

1812
01:26:56,630 --> 01:27:03,170
didn't really have much marijuana to

1813
01:26:58,130 --> 01:27:05,510
speak up to be honest but for people

1814
01:27:03,170 --> 01:27:08,989
listening I mean you get you mentioned

1815
01:27:05,510 --> 01:27:11,800
what you and when you're in in college

1816
01:27:08,988 --> 01:27:15,829
you wrote your paper what was it called

1817
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:18,050
botany and ecology of cannabis okay and

1818
01:27:15,829 --> 01:27:20,539
and and and then and then you follow

1819
01:27:18,050 --> 01:27:21,590
that up with you're in 1981 released

1820
01:27:20,539 --> 01:27:24,590
marijuana botany

1821
01:27:21,590 --> 01:27:27,980
correct and then you started working on

1822
01:27:24,590 --> 01:27:35,360
hashish yeah I moved

1823
01:27:27,979 --> 01:27:39,769
Amsterdam was at 87 maybe 1987 I guess

1824
01:27:35,359 --> 01:27:42,079
it was yeah 30 years ago well then just

1825
01:27:39,770 --> 01:27:44,230
in line of thinking of this what's your

1826
01:27:42,079 --> 01:27:46,819
next book project obviously now that

1827
01:27:44,229 --> 01:27:48,309
cannabis is finished you must be working

1828
01:27:46,819 --> 01:27:54,799
on something else

1829
01:27:48,310 --> 01:27:59,380
nice yeah I'm I'm working on another

1830
01:27:54,800 --> 01:28:01,820
body of cannabis knowledge actually it's

1831
01:27:59,380 --> 01:28:04,039
it's not going to be coming out as a

1832
01:28:01,819 --> 01:28:08,989
book except possibly for sentimental

1833
01:28:04,039 --> 01:28:12,529
value as a collection but I'm working on

1834
01:28:08,989 --> 01:28:14,479
trying to get this Turkish hemp

1835
01:28:12,529 --> 01:28:17,869
knowledge together well I have the chair

1836
01:28:14,479 --> 01:28:19,939
and instead of publishing something from

1837
01:28:17,869 --> 01:28:22,180
work I've done 10 or 20 years ago I'm

1838
01:28:19,939 --> 01:28:25,069
gonna do it reverse and publish the most

1839
01:28:22,180 --> 01:28:27,610
recent done things first and then work

1840
01:28:25,069 --> 01:28:33,039
back through the rest but it's all

1841
01:28:27,609 --> 01:28:37,279
pretty much I got a question about hash

1842
01:28:33,039 --> 01:28:39,979
our are you in any way looking to update

1843
01:28:37,279 --> 01:28:42,590
in the next you know two or three years

1844
01:28:39,979 --> 01:28:45,169
hashish its some of the breakthroughs

1845
01:28:42,590 --> 01:28:48,980
that have occurred in the world of dry

1846
01:28:45,170 --> 01:28:50,600
sifting in the world of rosin you know

1847
01:28:48,979 --> 01:28:52,399
these sort of things that are fairly new

1848
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:57,440
that haven't really been written about

1849
01:28:52,399 --> 01:29:00,739
oh well that's an interesting you'd

1850
01:28:57,439 --> 01:29:05,479
mention it because at the moment the

1851
01:29:00,739 --> 01:29:10,670
book is sliding out of print I would say

1852
01:29:05,479 --> 01:29:13,189
is it's it's near future and maybe where

1853
01:29:10,670 --> 01:29:17,989
there was a bit of a revision a few

1854
01:29:13,189 --> 01:29:20,509
years ago but yeah it's maybe done its

1855
01:29:17,989 --> 01:29:22,670
time maybe the the new knowledge should

1856
01:29:20,510 --> 01:29:24,110
be somewhere else maybe it should be

1857
01:29:22,670 --> 01:29:27,969
written by people who do what they're

1858
01:29:24,109 --> 01:29:29,618
doing not me secondhand

1859
01:29:27,969 --> 01:29:32,920
just personally that's why I see it I

1860
01:29:29,618 --> 01:29:36,248
have stuff to do I mean I'm not it's not

1861
01:29:32,920 --> 01:29:38,199
just that but the way I think people

1862
01:29:36,248 --> 01:29:40,840
should write what they're doing I think

1863
01:29:38,198 --> 01:29:44,288
they are I think they they extend

1864
01:29:40,840 --> 01:29:48,069
information for YouTube and Instagram

1865
01:29:44,288 --> 01:29:49,988
and especially YouTube for Jesus how

1866
01:29:48,069 --> 01:29:52,630
many videos are there of how to do cool

1867
01:29:49,988 --> 01:29:55,268
stuff from a cash run those are the

1868
01:29:52,630 --> 01:29:57,670
people really experts these days but the

1869
01:29:55,269 --> 01:29:59,679
other internships you still want to put

1870
01:29:57,670 --> 01:30:02,949
it in print no I don't have it in that

1871
01:29:59,679 --> 01:30:04,719
and like the cash beats me is the is the

1872
01:30:02,948 --> 01:30:07,808
greatest concentration

1873
01:30:04,719 --> 01:30:09,729
it's the 90 micron that whole book right

1874
01:30:07,809 --> 01:30:11,529
it's just like you know all the best

1875
01:30:09,729 --> 01:30:15,519
[ __ ] let's put it all in here you know

1876
01:30:11,529 --> 01:30:18,038
it's like we need to have the Bible

1877
01:30:15,519 --> 01:30:23,170
constantly updated it's all I'm saying I

1878
01:30:18,038 --> 01:30:24,969
agree with you I like blast yeah

1879
01:30:23,170 --> 01:30:27,550
books I will always have their place

1880
01:30:24,969 --> 01:30:29,198
just like vinyl records you know like

1881
01:30:27,550 --> 01:30:31,538
people will always want vinyl they're

1882
01:30:29,198 --> 01:30:33,638
never gonna you know there's always

1883
01:30:31,538 --> 01:30:35,439
going to people that people that love

1884
01:30:33,639 --> 01:30:38,260
them in books that they play an

1885
01:30:35,439 --> 01:30:40,118
important role in the sense that one day

1886
01:30:38,260 --> 01:30:43,559
if some of this digital knowledge is

1887
01:30:40,118 --> 01:30:49,509
lost or blipped and gone that books

1888
01:30:43,559 --> 01:30:52,650
books can still be there yeah I like

1889
01:30:49,510 --> 01:30:55,510
books too I'm just frustrated by a

1890
01:30:52,649 --> 01:31:00,248
changes and how people favor to receive

1891
01:30:55,510 --> 01:31:02,260
information these days so I said yeah I

1892
01:31:00,248 --> 01:31:04,510
don't want to just be cranky about it

1893
01:31:02,260 --> 01:31:06,340
and continue publishing books just

1894
01:31:04,510 --> 01:31:09,159
because they're cool now if I can afford

1895
01:31:06,340 --> 01:31:13,328
to publish books just post they're cool

1896
01:31:09,158 --> 01:31:16,388
I will do that but at the moment I'd

1897
01:31:13,328 --> 01:31:19,090
sort of like to get so I'm not making

1898
01:31:16,389 --> 01:31:21,010
any money anyway I'd sort of like to get

1899
01:31:19,090 --> 01:31:22,840
a little bang for my not buck and

1900
01:31:21,010 --> 01:31:24,909
educate a bunch more people if you get

1901
01:31:22,840 --> 01:31:29,050
like my drift

1902
01:31:24,908 --> 01:31:31,029
I mean give it away I didn't make any

1903
01:31:29,050 --> 01:31:33,489
money on the book anyway I don't foresee

1904
01:31:31,029 --> 01:31:35,768
making a heap no matter if it comes out

1905
01:31:33,488 --> 01:31:37,868
in paperback but no matter if they'd

1906
01:31:35,769 --> 01:31:41,520
make the Kindle a lot cheaper whatever

1907
01:31:37,868 --> 01:31:49,139
it's near crypto how about the

1908
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:51,030
sheesh app okay now you're talking you

1909
01:31:49,140 --> 01:31:53,400
know I really respect you saying that

1910
01:31:51,029 --> 01:31:55,829
Rob I mean I as someone that tries to

1911
01:31:53,399 --> 01:31:58,649
create projects like the culture high or

1912
01:31:55,829 --> 01:32:00,569
the Union or my first book or any of the

1913
01:31:58,649 --> 01:32:03,210
things I've worked on like the Emperor

1914
01:32:00,569 --> 01:32:05,250
it's about transmitting information and

1915
01:32:03,210 --> 01:32:07,140
sharing this knowledge and you don't get

1916
01:32:05,250 --> 01:32:09,329
paid on any of that stuff it's all a

1917
01:32:07,140 --> 01:32:10,860
labor of love and you know you put

1918
01:32:09,329 --> 01:32:13,529
seventeen turns into a book like

1919
01:32:10,859 --> 01:32:15,029
cannabis there is obviously only return

1920
01:32:13,529 --> 01:32:16,800
you think that is the good feeling you

1921
01:32:15,029 --> 01:32:21,479
get from sharing it with the politic but

1922
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:24,210
I'm so enthused yeah I'm doing it I

1923
01:32:21,479 --> 01:32:25,889
don't think there's a real great kid you

1924
01:32:24,210 --> 01:32:28,109
know really reward you for the

1925
01:32:25,890 --> 01:32:30,750
contribution you played in helping us

1926
01:32:28,109 --> 01:32:32,549
understand what you've learned and

1927
01:32:30,750 --> 01:32:35,729
communicating that so thank you very

1928
01:32:32,550 --> 01:32:40,680
much well thank you Todd

1929
01:32:35,729 --> 01:32:45,989
we also spent 15 years with publishing

1930
01:32:40,680 --> 01:32:50,119
the IH aid the Jha Journal of the end of

1931
01:32:45,989 --> 01:32:50,119
the International emphasis science-based

1932
01:32:52,310 --> 01:32:57,180
about it but you know I was sticking

1933
01:32:54,510 --> 01:32:59,039
with Hershey's you know when I first saw

1934
01:32:57,180 --> 01:33:02,220
the journal in the 90s I was blown away

1935
01:32:59,039 --> 01:33:05,010
and these educational kits that you put

1936
01:33:02,220 --> 01:33:06,630
together were fantastic I was fortunate

1937
01:33:05,010 --> 01:33:10,470
enough to buy one back in the mid 90s

1938
01:33:06,630 --> 01:33:12,510
that had crayons and oil and fabric and

1939
01:33:10,470 --> 01:33:14,820
all of these wonderful elements of

1940
01:33:12,510 --> 01:33:15,989
teaching and you know this is something

1941
01:33:14,819 --> 01:33:18,090
I would love you guys to talk about

1942
01:33:15,989 --> 01:33:20,819
because you really took an association

1943
01:33:18,090 --> 01:33:22,920
into a peer-reviewed level and actually

1944
01:33:20,819 --> 01:33:25,380
created a little textile kit that you

1945
01:33:22,920 --> 01:33:27,720
could touch feel smell and learn what

1946
01:33:25,380 --> 01:33:29,579
cannabis wasn't and no one in the world

1947
01:33:27,720 --> 01:33:31,890
has done that thank you guys and I want

1948
01:33:29,579 --> 01:33:33,960
to say thanks for that but how the hell

1949
01:33:31,890 --> 01:33:39,210
did you get to that in between your hash

1950
01:33:33,960 --> 01:33:42,770
and your cannabis growing on Emma

1951
01:33:39,210 --> 01:33:47,850
crayons we did have a little free time

1952
01:33:42,770 --> 01:33:49,950
but no it was art kind of ideas that

1953
01:33:47,850 --> 01:33:51,630
that Sam and I could cook up together

1954
01:33:49,949 --> 01:33:53,849
you know he was one of the pioneers in

1955
01:33:51,630 --> 01:33:57,809
doing this really and it

1956
01:33:53,849 --> 01:33:59,340
just needed a a group that was was

1957
01:33:57,809 --> 01:34:01,139
really devoted to getting real

1958
01:33:59,340 --> 01:34:02,699
information out to people whatever it

1959
01:34:01,139 --> 01:34:04,679
was it called the International amp

1960
01:34:02,698 --> 01:34:06,478
Association but there's really the

1961
01:34:04,679 --> 01:34:09,149
International canvas Association and

1962
01:34:06,479 --> 01:34:12,208
Dave pate also helped us Avery is

1963
01:34:09,149 --> 01:34:15,689
instrumental in this and I evander were

1964
01:34:12,208 --> 01:34:19,128
four oh yes I and I yeah we had a good

1965
01:34:15,689 --> 01:34:21,179
we had a good team gone but and we

1966
01:34:19,128 --> 01:34:23,519
solicit articles through all over the

1967
01:34:21,179 --> 01:34:26,368
world it was really pretty cool there

1968
01:34:23,519 --> 01:34:31,090
was a lot going on in the in the early

1969
01:34:26,368 --> 01:34:33,819
90s that in a lot of ways

1970
01:34:31,090 --> 01:34:35,110
more variety of things going on than

1971
01:34:33,819 --> 01:34:37,329
today there probably more people

1972
01:34:35,109 --> 01:34:40,059
involved than ever that European

1973
01:34:37,329 --> 01:34:41,590
industrial hemp Association just met a

1974
01:34:40,060 --> 01:34:45,520
few months ago and I think they had

1975
01:34:41,590 --> 01:34:48,460
close to 200 delegates this time now a

1976
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:52,450
bit of this is the CBD buzz because it's

1977
01:34:48,460 --> 01:34:54,760
become hemp issues but to write lease I

1978
01:34:52,449 --> 01:34:57,099
suppose but that's so so that's a little

1979
01:34:54,760 --> 01:34:58,420
bit a bit of a bump from that but still

1980
01:34:57,100 --> 01:35:00,280
I'm saying that that's a lot of

1981
01:34:58,420 --> 01:35:02,949
Delegates to go to an industrial hemp

1982
01:35:00,279 --> 01:35:10,359
meeting so and therefore pretty

1983
01:35:02,949 --> 01:35:12,849
international bunch I saw yeah when we

1984
01:35:10,359 --> 01:35:16,029
got her was just it was just becoming

1985
01:35:12,850 --> 01:35:19,690
legal to grow hemp again in large parts

1986
01:35:16,029 --> 01:35:21,809
of Europe especially well that that

1987
01:35:19,689 --> 01:35:23,859
effort yeah I wasn't effort we could

1988
01:35:21,810 --> 01:35:25,480
could help with it we helped with a

1989
01:35:23,859 --> 01:35:28,839
Vavilov Institute trying to preserve

1990
01:35:25,479 --> 01:35:31,389
what but genetics they had I'm not sure

1991
01:35:28,840 --> 01:35:34,930
in hindsight how successful we were and

1992
01:35:31,390 --> 01:35:38,350
how unsuccessful I'd been before we

1993
01:35:34,930 --> 01:35:40,240
started working with them but we'll find

1994
01:35:38,350 --> 01:35:44,380
out that we were the finalists project

1995
01:35:40,239 --> 01:35:45,609
again yeah we we were successful in

1996
01:35:44,380 --> 01:35:48,310
helping them out and keeping things

1997
01:35:45,609 --> 01:35:51,279
alive it's just maybe if the collections

1998
01:35:48,310 --> 01:35:53,500
we preserved weren't as pure breeding as

1999
01:35:51,279 --> 01:35:57,069
we might hope they would be somewhat car

2000
01:35:53,500 --> 01:35:58,569
legs work showed this and it's it's been

2001
01:35:57,069 --> 01:36:01,090
interpreted other ways but that's

2002
01:35:58,569 --> 01:36:03,340
probably just contamination and I'm

2003
01:36:01,090 --> 01:36:06,520
trying to keep open pollinated lines

2004
01:36:03,340 --> 01:36:08,800
separate they had over 400 of them which

2005
01:36:06,520 --> 01:36:11,290
they produced in about nine different

2006
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:13,119
facilities or something back to Soviet

2007
01:36:11,289 --> 01:36:17,229
days but as all I fell apart

2008
01:36:13,119 --> 01:36:19,449
we took a money and help them get

2009
01:36:17,229 --> 01:36:21,639
freezers and do all that stuff they

2010
01:36:19,449 --> 01:36:27,250
needed to do to keep up had a lot and

2011
01:36:21,640 --> 01:36:28,960
grow some of it out I know that apart I

2012
01:36:27,250 --> 01:36:32,079
know that the part of the collection

2013
01:36:28,960 --> 01:36:34,930
just moved into the hands of ben

2014
01:36:32,079 --> 01:36:37,960
dronkers and hem flax and I had the

2015
01:36:34,930 --> 01:36:41,490
honour of visiting a test plot where

2016
01:36:37,960 --> 01:36:43,420
they had 200 different varieties growing

2017
01:36:41,489 --> 01:36:44,349
simultaneously and there was you know

2018
01:36:43,420 --> 01:36:47,649
the gentleman

2019
01:36:44,350 --> 01:36:49,720
and all the all the readings and such

2020
01:36:47,649 --> 01:36:53,409
and it was just great to see the

2021
01:36:49,720 --> 01:36:56,140
diversity in the varieties of hemp that

2022
01:36:53,409 --> 01:36:58,710
you know came from the Bella and that's

2023
01:36:56,140 --> 01:37:10,390
only I believed not even half of what he

2024
01:36:58,710 --> 01:37:13,210
got from them Turner from Dara sessions

2025
01:37:10,390 --> 01:37:14,800
just a hybrid between two of them and

2026
01:37:13,210 --> 01:37:17,920
then polished up from there so that

2027
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:19,480
shows you what what gene banks can be

2028
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:21,550
good for right there yeah I actually

2029
01:37:19,479 --> 01:37:25,959
made the hybrid and gave it to Jase

2030
01:37:21,550 --> 01:37:30,460
Calloway Jess ran in Finland defense

2031
01:37:25,960 --> 01:37:39,220
finola my high oil content was able to

2032
01:37:30,460 --> 01:37:40,960
survive under oh I don't know if you can

2033
01:37:39,220 --> 01:37:44,619
hear it not but what's even more

2034
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:45,579
important is that it's the highest seed

2035
01:37:44,619 --> 01:37:48,729
yielding

2036
01:37:45,579 --> 01:37:54,600
it'll get two tonnes per hectare where

2037
01:37:48,729 --> 01:37:57,039
most varieties can barely get a ton yes

2038
01:37:54,600 --> 01:37:59,230
it makes sense I wonder if it's the oil

2039
01:37:57,039 --> 01:38:01,500
content or it's just the amount of seeds

2040
01:37:59,229 --> 01:38:06,149
that you're getting is just like double

2041
01:38:01,500 --> 01:38:06,149
just a little short plant with a great

2042
01:38:07,949 --> 01:38:15,699
phenotype for Percy production yeah I

2043
01:38:13,479 --> 01:38:18,669
started to speak about it in Vancouver

2044
01:38:15,699 --> 01:38:23,079
at the hemp symposium that they threw

2045
01:38:18,670 --> 01:38:29,710
here one year in the 90s I was there I

2046
01:38:23,079 --> 01:38:31,479
spoke at it so they you know for those

2047
01:38:29,710 --> 01:38:34,140
of us that are still in the world where

2048
01:38:31,479 --> 01:38:36,699
we're calling stuff sativa and indica

2049
01:38:34,140 --> 01:38:38,170
obviously cannabis evolution and that's

2050
01:38:36,699 --> 01:38:40,739
no botany you kind of move away from

2051
01:38:38,170 --> 01:38:43,390
that you know could how do you see us

2052
01:38:40,739 --> 01:38:49,859
classifying the current cannabis that we

2053
01:38:43,390 --> 01:38:52,390
smoke in a more appropriate manner well

2054
01:38:49,859 --> 01:38:54,399
let's talk about the cannabis we don't

2055
01:38:52,390 --> 01:38:56,249
smoke that would be cannabis sativa you

2056
01:38:54,399 --> 01:39:00,029
mentioned it earlier

2057
01:38:56,248 --> 01:39:03,448
this is the represents the European or

2058
01:39:00,029 --> 01:39:06,408
at least Western Eurasian traditional

2059
01:39:03,448 --> 01:39:10,379
varieties that were used for fiber and

2060
01:39:06,408 --> 01:39:14,518
oilseed and those became the earliest

2061
01:39:10,380 --> 01:39:17,159
sessions taken to America our room to

2062
01:39:14,519 --> 01:39:20,760
route all the rest of the cannabis would

2063
01:39:17,158 --> 01:39:23,009
call that cannabis sativa what Carl von

2064
01:39:20,760 --> 01:39:25,170
Linde a Carlos one is called cannabis

2065
01:39:23,010 --> 01:39:28,309
achievements it's not breaking with

2066
01:39:25,170 --> 01:39:31,260
tradition it's following tradition and

2067
01:39:28,309 --> 01:39:33,779
then the rest of the world apart from

2068
01:39:31,260 --> 01:39:35,940
that cannabis all the rest cannabis in

2069
01:39:33,779 --> 01:39:37,859
the world except for Western Europe

2070
01:39:35,939 --> 01:39:39,960
North America and a little bit in South

2071
01:39:37,859 --> 01:39:47,098
America and Chile couple other places

2072
01:39:39,960 --> 01:39:53,448
it's all ended all over whether it comes

2073
01:39:47,099 --> 01:39:57,719
from Afghanistan or India or China Korea

2074
01:39:53,448 --> 01:40:00,479
or Thailand some version of indica now

2075
01:39:57,719 --> 01:40:03,800
this is based on basically what Karl

2076
01:40:00,479 --> 01:40:05,788
hillock figured out using isozymes

2077
01:40:03,800 --> 01:40:08,510
differences in protein throughout the

2078
01:40:05,788 --> 01:40:10,828
differences in DNA as people for more

2079
01:40:08,510 --> 01:40:12,780
prone to do today but this is all I

2080
01:40:10,828 --> 01:40:17,788
researched it was published ten years

2081
01:40:12,779 --> 01:40:19,439
ago and Karl basically showed through

2082
01:40:17,788 --> 01:40:23,309
the diversity of these compounds and

2083
01:40:19,439 --> 01:40:25,529
terpenes and and phenotypic

2084
01:40:23,309 --> 01:40:28,980
characteristics as well gross phenotypes

2085
01:40:25,529 --> 01:40:30,538
that there were these differences and at

2086
01:40:28,979 --> 01:40:33,299
the large encompassing group was

2087
01:40:30,538 --> 01:40:35,340
cannabis indica divided into if you

2088
01:40:33,300 --> 01:40:39,710
don't include the supposed wild or

2089
01:40:35,340 --> 01:40:43,349
escape types type then three subspecies

2090
01:40:39,710 --> 01:40:47,059
basically indica subspecies indica the

2091
01:40:43,349 --> 01:40:51,538
narrow leaf drug varieties from India

2092
01:40:47,059 --> 01:40:54,449
ones that Lamarck had described and

2093
01:40:51,538 --> 01:40:56,759
originally called cannabis indica and

2094
01:40:54,448 --> 01:40:59,549
that's once again following traditions

2095
01:40:56,760 --> 01:41:01,829
this is a main subspecies this is what

2096
01:40:59,550 --> 01:41:09,090
we had before we had things from

2097
01:41:01,828 --> 01:41:11,819
Afghanistan Mexican Colombian Jamaican

2098
01:41:09,090 --> 01:41:15,270
hi all have came from the and all the

2099
01:41:11,819 --> 01:41:18,719
African branch - yes came from South

2100
01:41:15,270 --> 01:41:21,630
southern embrace came from India

2101
01:41:18,719 --> 01:41:29,750
originally from the Indian ganja right

2102
01:41:21,630 --> 01:41:29,750
marijuana was the other one that we know

2103
01:41:30,139 --> 01:41:40,859
for a second is like actively making

2104
01:41:33,929 --> 01:41:51,770
hash over there sounds like you got a

2105
01:41:40,859 --> 01:41:51,769
roto go in the background so big we can

2106
01:41:53,539 --> 01:42:01,219
completely back me 43 kilos and 200

2107
01:41:59,429 --> 01:42:04,649
grams of hash

2108
01:42:01,219 --> 01:42:10,069
during Hester yes this is real really

2109
01:42:04,649 --> 01:42:10,069
and he it's making history

2110
01:42:10,550 --> 01:42:16,139
it was so repetitive it's so long there

2111
01:42:14,130 --> 01:42:18,359
was only so many things that could be I

2112
01:42:16,139 --> 01:42:20,520
knew he wasn't subtly drumming to his

2113
01:42:18,359 --> 01:42:23,729
beat in his own head I knew that wasn't

2114
01:42:20,520 --> 01:42:30,349
it I knew wasn't it was motivated by I'm

2115
01:42:23,729 --> 01:42:30,348
gonna get high later ok I'm jokin

2116
01:42:30,439 --> 01:42:37,919
makes me want to smokes man the average

2117
01:42:36,060 --> 01:42:39,810
the long story but it's all make it as

2118
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:41,069
short as possible there's the Chinese

2119
01:42:39,810 --> 01:42:43,530
varieties ok

2120
01:42:41,069 --> 01:42:46,529
they were also first capital and seed

2121
01:42:43,529 --> 01:42:49,800
primarily drug culture least not in

2122
01:42:46,529 --> 01:42:54,198
recent history and that would include

2123
01:42:49,800 --> 01:42:58,139
Korea and Japan and those varieties are

2124
01:42:54,198 --> 01:43:01,289
broadleaf temp varieties as bright as I

2125
01:42:58,139 --> 01:43:05,039
ended up calling and wide leaf varieties

2126
01:43:01,289 --> 01:43:08,639
as problem and then there's of course

2127
01:43:05,039 --> 01:43:11,250
Afghan that's cannabis indica so species

2128
01:43:08,639 --> 01:43:13,380
Afghan Achatz the broadleaf varieties

2129
01:43:11,250 --> 01:43:16,649
that's what came to us you know starting

2130
01:43:13,380 --> 01:43:18,600
in the late seventies and then has been

2131
01:43:16,649 --> 01:43:21,299
hybridized

2132
01:43:18,600 --> 01:43:23,100
ad infinitum with the original narrow

2133
01:43:21,300 --> 01:43:25,199
leaf drug rise we had and that's what

2134
01:43:23,100 --> 01:43:29,490
you is what we have today so that's

2135
01:43:25,199 --> 01:43:31,679
that's how we see the hi-c mark and I

2136
01:43:29,489 --> 01:43:34,800
see in others John with Portland and

2137
01:43:31,680 --> 01:43:37,590
Carl Hill again when Ernest small though

2138
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:40,320
he just just published a foot long paper

2139
01:43:37,590 --> 01:43:43,319
and renamed them again which I wasn't

2140
01:43:40,319 --> 01:43:44,969
quite sure the need to but anyway we all

2141
01:43:43,319 --> 01:43:48,779
are even up for a pretty much from the

2142
01:43:44,970 --> 01:43:51,210
side management yeah Sam's figures it's

2143
01:43:48,779 --> 01:43:53,399
about right that's it'll be interesting

2144
01:43:51,210 --> 01:43:56,730
to put the finest project to work and

2145
01:43:53,399 --> 01:44:01,859
see the interrelatedness of the the land

2146
01:43:56,729 --> 01:44:03,959
races that were around and and back in

2147
01:44:01,859 --> 01:44:06,569
the day when they were first around and

2148
01:44:03,960 --> 01:44:08,579
ones that were found where they were

2149
01:44:06,569 --> 01:44:11,219
originally from and put them into this

2150
01:44:08,579 --> 01:44:13,649
project and see how they are

2151
01:44:11,220 --> 01:44:15,750
interrelated this is the evolutionary

2152
01:44:13,649 --> 01:44:18,059
side that fascinates me I kind of know

2153
01:44:15,750 --> 01:44:19,800
what happened in the historical side I'm

2154
01:44:18,060 --> 01:44:23,210
much more interested to figure out what

2155
01:44:19,800 --> 01:44:30,140
I don't know the predates the my

2156
01:44:23,210 --> 01:44:32,760
historical side guess your awesome

2157
01:44:30,140 --> 01:44:34,289
someone's asking about Japanese strains

2158
01:44:32,760 --> 01:44:43,079
someone's saying do you guys know any of

2159
01:44:34,289 --> 01:44:49,109
anything about any Japanese friends the

2160
01:44:43,079 --> 01:44:53,359
job yes have one registered yeah few

2161
01:44:49,109 --> 01:44:55,559
other land races Rebecca Mona

2162
01:44:53,359 --> 01:45:02,369
yeah they use them to make kimonos

2163
01:44:55,560 --> 01:45:04,350
ceremonial kimonos it's a really rare

2164
01:45:02,369 --> 01:45:06,239
expensive fiber oh yes they do go out

2165
01:45:04,350 --> 01:45:10,050
there well that's been mostly a place

2166
01:45:06,239 --> 01:45:11,969
called Tochigi ken and that's and what

2167
01:45:10,050 --> 01:45:12,449
the girls Tochigi sure I mean it's white

2168
01:45:11,970 --> 01:45:18,960
Toshi

2169
01:45:12,449 --> 01:45:23,189
- Chi Chi so I guess you saw the article

2170
01:45:18,960 --> 01:45:25,500
where they went and actually met with

2171
01:45:23,189 --> 01:45:27,839
the women who actually made the garments

2172
01:45:25,500 --> 01:45:30,260
and their teeth are worn from pulling

2173
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:32,309
the hemp with their teeth yeah

2174
01:45:30,260 --> 01:45:36,000
separating the fiber

2175
01:45:32,309 --> 01:45:39,960
now I split the strips of barking and

2176
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:46,738
narrower strips of bark yeah they ran

2177
01:45:39,960 --> 01:45:49,920
out of fingernails finer in Japan or in

2178
01:45:46,738 --> 01:45:52,408
Korea or in China the finest of the

2179
01:45:49,920 --> 01:45:55,739
finest you've ever seen how the finest

2180
01:45:52,408 --> 01:45:59,538
temp weaving here being sheerest him

2181
01:45:55,738 --> 01:46:03,299
finest yarns thinnest cloth would be

2182
01:45:59,538 --> 01:46:04,439
Foom Japanese or Japanese style cloth

2183
01:46:03,300 --> 01:46:06,869
made in Korea

2184
01:46:04,439 --> 01:46:10,469
you could also say but yeah it's

2185
01:46:06,868 --> 01:46:12,630
incredible it's like I asked a paper

2186
01:46:10,469 --> 01:46:15,599
question who's making the best paper in

2187
01:46:12,630 --> 01:46:18,650
the world right now I really don't know

2188
01:46:15,599 --> 01:46:20,819
that there used to be a mill that did

2189
01:46:18,649 --> 01:46:22,859
cigarette papers he stopped still in

2190
01:46:20,819 --> 01:46:26,658
Turkey but it's closed I just was I

2191
01:46:22,859 --> 01:46:32,130
think it's in Spain now spans got solos

2192
01:46:26,658 --> 01:46:35,879
solo so right natsu no solo yeah

2193
01:46:32,130 --> 01:46:38,159
Schneider song was the paper supplier in

2194
01:46:35,880 --> 01:46:41,489
Germany they're a big paper splasher

2195
01:46:38,158 --> 01:46:44,808
you're so good they they made custom

2196
01:46:41,488 --> 01:46:44,808
batches for us right

2197
01:46:46,618 --> 01:47:00,779
but we're brown ones iRobot can we print

2198
01:46:55,710 --> 01:47:03,359
journals on just to be patriotic like to

2199
01:47:00,779 --> 01:47:05,670
point out that we have tried to link to

2200
01:47:03,359 --> 01:47:08,098
your international hep association org

2201
01:47:05,670 --> 01:47:14,908
website and the links to the journals I

2202
01:47:08,099 --> 01:47:18,980
don't work I get a borrow for two if we

2203
01:47:14,908 --> 01:47:18,979
could request if you all get that fit

2204
01:47:20,359 --> 01:47:27,929
yeah maintain is a labor of love so yes

2205
01:47:26,099 --> 01:47:30,380
a few days ago worked according to Sam

2206
01:47:27,929 --> 01:47:33,328
so it'll probably come back on again

2207
01:47:30,380 --> 01:47:34,828
it's a bit difficult to search articles

2208
01:47:33,328 --> 01:47:37,469
on it it isn't really indexed you have

2209
01:47:34,828 --> 01:47:40,288
to go to each issue and see what's in it

2210
01:47:37,469 --> 01:47:43,429
sort of it's not not just smooth but

2211
01:47:40,288 --> 01:47:43,429
it's been up there for ages

2212
01:47:45,789 --> 01:47:51,800
it's done by one of them do you think

2213
01:47:48,139 --> 01:47:56,029
there's an apology's no I was gonna ask

2214
01:47:51,800 --> 01:47:58,550
is there an economic reason why a hemp

2215
01:47:56,029 --> 01:48:10,039
is being used more for paper and

2216
01:47:58,550 --> 01:48:14,449
cardboard packaging yeah it doesn't make

2217
01:48:10,039 --> 01:48:16,908
much sense to grow fibers unless they

2218
01:48:14,448 --> 01:48:18,500
have for things like packaging unless

2219
01:48:16,908 --> 01:48:24,198
they have a very high end use

2220
01:48:18,500 --> 01:48:26,929
I mean hemp flax can grow hemp fiber and

2221
01:48:24,198 --> 01:48:29,809
get it into mercedes-benz car door

2222
01:48:26,929 --> 01:48:31,310
panels and stuff but it wouldn't make

2223
01:48:29,810 --> 01:48:36,199
they wouldn't be able solve for enough

2224
01:48:31,310 --> 01:48:40,100
if a paper process your bonnet there's

2225
01:48:36,198 --> 01:48:42,079
also probably a limited number of paper

2226
01:48:40,100 --> 01:48:44,500
mills that could work with it anymore -

2227
01:48:42,079 --> 01:48:47,719
but that's another consideration but

2228
01:48:44,500 --> 01:48:50,359
even if there were but what doesn't

2229
01:48:47,719 --> 01:48:53,359
travel economically it needs to be done

2230
01:48:50,359 --> 01:48:56,750
on a local basis paper making is

2231
01:48:53,359 --> 01:49:01,420
polluting well yeah I mean not that just

2232
01:48:56,750 --> 01:49:01,420
a point the fact is is that you're

2233
01:49:02,319 --> 01:49:09,049
you're using mostly waste from the wood

2234
01:49:06,500 --> 01:49:13,789
and lumber industry to essentially turn

2235
01:49:09,050 --> 01:49:15,619
your into any marker and pulp that's the

2236
01:49:13,789 --> 01:49:17,479
real story mark you need more help

2237
01:49:15,618 --> 01:49:19,309
that's why there isn't enough for

2238
01:49:17,479 --> 01:49:21,049
anything and exactly as Rob says it

2239
01:49:19,310 --> 01:49:24,050
needs to be grown locally in processed

2240
01:49:21,050 --> 01:49:26,300
locally I've made enough paper dust

2241
01:49:24,050 --> 01:49:29,179
which basically they have to get rid of

2242
01:49:26,300 --> 01:49:30,739
they're now mandated in the lumber

2243
01:49:29,179 --> 01:49:33,109
industry that then everywhere else that

2244
01:49:30,738 --> 01:49:36,218
they make [ __ ] to get rid of their

2245
01:49:33,109 --> 01:49:39,289
weights responsibly they can actually

2246
01:49:36,219 --> 01:49:40,760
sell it to a paper mill if it's the

2247
01:49:39,289 --> 01:49:43,850
right quality form some of it at least

2248
01:49:40,760 --> 01:49:45,320
and so that's a kind of a win-win

2249
01:49:43,850 --> 01:49:47,600
situation for everybody they don't have

2250
01:49:45,319 --> 01:49:49,368
to get much for it then they gotta get

2251
01:49:47,600 --> 01:49:51,230
rid of it so that's what you're

2252
01:49:49,368 --> 01:49:54,289
competing against with any natural fiber

2253
01:49:51,229 --> 01:49:55,379
it's it's not just about hemp you know

2254
01:49:54,289 --> 01:50:00,869
it's

2255
01:49:55,380 --> 01:50:02,430
whoo flax I have the same problem it's

2256
01:50:00,869 --> 01:50:04,019
why we had such problems with dealing

2257
01:50:02,430 --> 01:50:07,560
with hemp in Eastern Europe we were so

2258
01:50:04,020 --> 01:50:09,660
landlocked to ship or move it to actual

2259
01:50:07,560 --> 01:50:12,930
factories to process it or strip it down

2260
01:50:09,659 --> 01:50:15,840
into you know fibers spin it into a

2261
01:50:12,930 --> 01:50:18,869
fiber then ship it into the manufacture

2262
01:50:15,840 --> 01:50:20,400
that puts it into a cloth etc etc so the

2263
01:50:18,869 --> 01:50:22,199
herd and everything is lost along the

2264
01:50:20,399 --> 01:50:24,119
way and it's really kind of a waste

2265
01:50:22,199 --> 01:50:26,909
because it's just not enough of it it's

2266
01:50:24,119 --> 01:50:29,460
mostly grown for the fiber itself mark

2267
01:50:26,909 --> 01:50:31,439
you know current or it was back when we

2268
01:50:29,460 --> 01:50:34,020
were dealing with it in Eastern Europe I

2269
01:50:31,439 --> 01:50:36,089
I guess the way myself as an industrial

2270
01:50:34,020 --> 01:50:39,390
chemist the way I look at it is that

2271
01:50:36,090 --> 01:50:41,699
it's died you lost it's also the

2272
01:50:39,390 --> 01:50:43,740
cheapest form of cellulose at the end of

2273
01:50:41,699 --> 01:50:46,349
the day is gonna win and so whether that

2274
01:50:43,739 --> 01:50:48,630
cheapest form of cellulose comes from

2275
01:50:46,350 --> 01:50:50,640
off of the floor at the sawmill because

2276
01:50:48,630 --> 01:50:52,739
the sawdust just happens to be there

2277
01:50:50,640 --> 01:50:55,590
when you're making two-by-fours and

2278
01:50:52,739 --> 01:50:56,939
lumber okay I get that but the other

2279
01:50:55,590 --> 01:50:59,069
thing that we have to take into

2280
01:50:56,939 --> 01:51:02,069
consideration is that there's a whole

2281
01:50:59,069 --> 01:51:07,559
lot more chemicals that are used to

2282
01:51:02,069 --> 01:51:10,649
dealing by wood than 2d lignified ham

2283
01:51:07,560 --> 01:51:12,450
hams got a whole lot less lignin in

2284
01:51:10,649 --> 01:51:15,239
there which is basically what you're

2285
01:51:12,449 --> 01:51:17,970
doing in a paper mill you're just

2286
01:51:15,239 --> 01:51:19,619
separating the lignin from the cellulose

2287
01:51:17,970 --> 01:51:22,380
because the cellulose is what the paper

2288
01:51:19,619 --> 01:51:24,269
is so at the end of the day you know I

2289
01:51:22,380 --> 01:51:26,970
don't know if ten years or 20 years down

2290
01:51:24,270 --> 01:51:30,390
the road at some point half pipe is

2291
01:51:26,970 --> 01:51:33,090
gonna be a more economical form of

2292
01:51:30,390 --> 01:51:35,610
cellulose and will replace wood that's

2293
01:51:33,090 --> 01:51:37,350
just an economic reality well we're

2294
01:51:35,609 --> 01:51:40,079
hoping for so we're just starting to see

2295
01:51:37,350 --> 01:51:42,060
test trials here in America in certain

2296
01:51:40,079 --> 01:51:46,229
states now due to you know the legality

2297
01:51:42,060 --> 01:51:47,670
and we're gonna see you know we're gonna

2298
01:51:46,229 --> 01:51:49,889
see a whole new industries come out of

2299
01:51:47,670 --> 01:51:51,569
it we were talking 20 years ago you know

2300
01:51:49,890 --> 01:51:54,690
all the 50 thousand products that can be

2301
01:51:51,569 --> 01:51:57,750
made etcetera etc but when the rubber

2302
01:51:54,689 --> 01:52:00,269
hits the road you know Ben can only sell

2303
01:51:57,750 --> 01:52:01,529
his herds for animal bedding no that's

2304
01:52:00,270 --> 01:52:03,690
what worked that's what we're tech

2305
01:52:01,529 --> 01:52:05,250
anomaly that's what worked locally right

2306
01:52:03,689 --> 01:52:08,669
no that's going to happen locally and

2307
01:52:05,250 --> 01:52:09,180
regionally as these things come to scale

2308
01:52:08,670 --> 01:52:11,039
that's

2309
01:52:09,180 --> 01:52:14,100
the reality is it's cheaper in excess

2310
01:52:11,039 --> 01:52:16,470
all right what's gonna happen and I

2311
01:52:14,100 --> 01:52:19,200
don't know if Rob would agree with me on

2312
01:52:16,470 --> 01:52:22,190
this I think the main driver is going to

2313
01:52:19,199 --> 01:52:24,630
be protein production in the hemp seed

2314
01:52:22,189 --> 01:52:26,099
protein production in the hemp seed is

2315
01:52:24,630 --> 01:52:28,980
going to be the economic driver that's

2316
01:52:26,100 --> 01:52:30,840
basically going to bring help to a scale

2317
01:52:28,979 --> 01:52:33,479
of farming that again is going to create

2318
01:52:30,840 --> 01:52:36,840
a huge volume of cellulose that's going

2319
01:52:33,479 --> 01:52:39,359
to be cheaper than sawdust well I can I

2320
01:52:36,840 --> 01:52:41,909
can tell you that the the protein and

2321
01:52:39,359 --> 01:52:45,809
the seed is exactly what that we grow

2322
01:52:41,909 --> 01:52:48,899
hemp for in Canada for 20 years but it's

2323
01:52:45,810 --> 01:52:52,770
not to make it cheap it's it's expensive

2324
01:52:48,899 --> 01:52:55,920
that seed sells for like almost $15 or

2325
01:52:52,770 --> 01:52:57,930
something for like a little like 400 ml

2326
01:52:55,920 --> 01:53:00,270
bottle or something like that so it's

2327
01:52:57,930 --> 01:53:03,090
become about the most expensive product

2328
01:53:00,270 --> 01:53:04,830
that you can get is this protein and the

2329
01:53:03,090 --> 01:53:07,980
protein powder isolate that's the

2330
01:53:04,829 --> 01:53:11,819
byproduct of pressing the seed cake to

2331
01:53:07,979 --> 01:53:14,159
again if instead of instead of Roundup

2332
01:53:11,819 --> 01:53:17,819
Ready soybeans all throughout Manitoba

2333
01:53:14,159 --> 01:53:19,800
and and and and Western Canada imagine

2334
01:53:17,819 --> 01:53:22,590
if instead of soybeans those were hemp

2335
01:53:19,800 --> 01:53:25,560
plants right and those were having it's

2336
01:53:22,590 --> 01:53:27,900
creating hemp seed for hemp seed protein

2337
01:53:25,560 --> 01:53:32,700
it will happen someday because and it's

2338
01:53:27,899 --> 01:53:36,779
just it I think we drew 33,000 hectares

2339
01:53:32,699 --> 01:53:40,079
last year in Manitoba Saskatchewan and

2340
01:53:36,779 --> 01:53:42,300
Ontario which is not a pimple on the ass

2341
01:53:40,079 --> 01:53:46,019
of what's grown in terms of soybean and

2342
01:53:42,300 --> 01:53:47,699
corn right oh god no or any like flax or

2343
01:53:46,020 --> 01:53:50,580
any of the other stuff and many of the

2344
01:53:47,699 --> 01:53:52,529
wrote Roe Grove typical row vegetables

2345
01:53:50,579 --> 01:53:56,189
we wrote industrial crops

2346
01:53:52,529 --> 01:53:59,369
yeah we still we have millions of acres

2347
01:53:56,189 --> 01:54:02,819
of farmable land millions of acres so

2348
01:53:59,369 --> 01:54:04,470
it's just a very small percentage of

2349
01:54:02,819 --> 01:54:06,929
that that's for sure and it's because

2350
01:54:04,470 --> 01:54:08,460
we've never turned it into paper we

2351
01:54:06,930 --> 01:54:11,329
never turned it into products I've

2352
01:54:08,460 --> 01:54:14,399
always considered the fact that the

2353
01:54:11,329 --> 01:54:16,680
infrastructures are truly immense they

2354
01:54:14,399 --> 01:54:18,239
are billion dollar infrastructure people

2355
01:54:16,680 --> 01:54:19,710
think it's just plug and play and

2356
01:54:18,239 --> 01:54:21,300
they're like oh let's just use hemp for

2357
01:54:19,710 --> 01:54:22,948
this instead of this and well just like

2358
01:54:21,300 --> 01:54:25,409
you don't even have to change

2359
01:54:22,948 --> 01:54:27,448
in fact you do have to change everything

2360
01:54:25,408 --> 01:54:37,618
and you do change a lot of things for

2361
01:54:27,448 --> 01:54:41,308
certain things and I agree with a mark

2362
01:54:37,618 --> 01:54:43,319
that should there be enough seed grown

2363
01:54:41,309 --> 01:54:44,849
and seed burden seed is the most viable

2364
01:54:43,319 --> 01:54:47,998
thing to do with that but always has

2365
01:54:44,849 --> 01:54:49,679
been since that movement changed you

2366
01:54:47,998 --> 01:54:52,139
know the way people were thinking about

2367
01:54:49,679 --> 01:54:54,899
hemp it's the fiber things falling away

2368
01:54:52,139 --> 01:54:58,050
pretty much and where's the paper and

2369
01:54:54,899 --> 01:54:59,670
that the seedings carried on did if that

2370
01:54:58,050 --> 01:55:01,498
really does take off then of course

2371
01:54:59,670 --> 01:55:03,538
you'd have a by-product from that you'd

2372
01:55:01,498 --> 01:55:04,889
have the chaff whatever they need to

2373
01:55:03,538 --> 01:55:06,748
chop it up and get rid of it like any

2374
01:55:04,889 --> 01:55:09,389
other industry they can put it back on

2375
01:55:06,748 --> 01:55:11,248
the fields you know the lumber companies

2376
01:55:09,389 --> 01:55:14,368
can't really put it back in the forest

2377
01:55:11,248 --> 01:55:17,998
but great there are no planets but there

2378
01:55:14,368 --> 01:55:21,689
could be a surplus of stuff one thing

2379
01:55:17,998 --> 01:55:24,478
I'd like to mention is that when the

2380
01:55:21,689 --> 01:55:27,808
hemp thing was going 20 years ago you

2381
01:55:24,479 --> 01:55:32,309
know in 15 20 years ago was that its

2382
01:55:27,809 --> 01:55:33,958
heyday would say it was really

2383
01:55:32,309 --> 01:55:37,860
fascinating there's a lot of energy to

2384
01:55:33,958 --> 01:55:41,908
it and and looking back probably a lot

2385
01:55:37,859 --> 01:55:44,130
of it was premature I think now is a

2386
01:55:41,908 --> 01:55:46,049
much more opportune time for somebody to

2387
01:55:44,130 --> 01:55:49,469
try to get involved in hemp business I

2388
01:55:46,050 --> 01:55:51,090
mean cannabis has you don't have to go

2389
01:55:49,469 --> 01:55:52,198
around telling people that hemp is

2390
01:55:51,090 --> 01:55:54,748
related to cannabis

2391
01:55:52,198 --> 01:55:56,879
oh yeah cannabis fallout I mean the

2392
01:55:54,748 --> 01:55:58,978
times have completely changed now yeah

2393
01:55:56,880 --> 01:56:01,739
everybody knows what canvasses everybody

2394
01:55:58,979 --> 01:56:04,889
knows that out comes from everybody but

2395
01:56:01,738 --> 01:56:08,698
a lot more people so it might be

2396
01:56:04,889 --> 01:56:10,440
interesting to see you know if somebody

2397
01:56:08,698 --> 01:56:13,529
launches something these days with a

2398
01:56:10,439 --> 01:56:15,328
little bit better supplies of raw

2399
01:56:13,529 --> 01:56:17,759
materials possibly even if the Chinese

2400
01:56:15,328 --> 01:56:19,649
Mills are still rocking and you know

2401
01:56:17,760 --> 01:56:23,760
Ben's trying to get online in Romania

2402
01:56:19,649 --> 01:56:25,859
it'll be interesting to see how the the

2403
01:56:23,760 --> 01:56:29,190
second wave of the health industry turns

2404
01:56:25,859 --> 01:56:31,380
out yeah I'm excited to see how that

2405
01:56:29,189 --> 01:56:34,109
transpires because after being part of

2406
01:56:31,380 --> 01:56:35,939
the initial one that kind of fizzled it

2407
01:56:34,109 --> 01:56:36,779
was there was a great deal of enthusiasm

2408
01:56:35,939 --> 01:56:39,719
and

2409
01:56:36,779 --> 01:56:42,479
still is and it's great so the h IH has

2410
01:56:39,719 --> 01:56:44,480
had its you know gathering and of people

2411
01:56:42,479 --> 01:56:47,459
and such and there's just leave

2412
01:56:44,479 --> 01:56:50,098
innovation and more pushing but again

2413
01:56:47,460 --> 01:56:55,139
they're still made by this you know this

2414
01:56:50,099 --> 01:56:57,809
fictitious EU seed that I think is limit

2415
01:56:55,139 --> 01:56:59,809
ating somewhat to the industrial ideas

2416
01:56:57,809 --> 01:57:03,599
that we've been presented about cannabis

2417
01:56:59,809 --> 01:57:06,239
but I still think that you know Ben and

2418
01:57:03,599 --> 01:57:09,538
others have proven through you know

2419
01:57:06,238 --> 01:57:12,598
firsthand realities even though I mean

2420
01:57:09,538 --> 01:57:13,198
Ben himself took 17 years lost to make a

2421
01:57:12,599 --> 01:57:16,409
profit

2422
01:57:13,198 --> 01:57:21,118
you know out of hemp flax so that's a

2423
01:57:16,408 --> 01:57:24,058
great deal of of time money research not

2424
01:57:21,118 --> 01:57:25,769
many people have that so again respect

2425
01:57:24,059 --> 01:57:28,079
for even having that opportunity to do

2426
01:57:25,770 --> 01:57:30,000
that but he's led the way for many of us

2427
01:57:28,078 --> 01:57:33,238
to see that yes it can be done because

2428
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:35,969
my car outside has his hemp in it right

2429
01:57:33,238 --> 01:57:37,379
now you know and that's a beautiful

2430
01:57:35,969 --> 01:57:39,328
thing but yet a frustrating thing

2431
01:57:37,380 --> 01:57:40,739
because I still have to tell people

2432
01:57:39,328 --> 01:57:41,908
about it they still don't know about it

2433
01:57:40,738 --> 01:57:46,669
they still don't understand its

2434
01:57:41,908 --> 01:57:51,138
possibilities no it's really right now

2435
01:57:46,670 --> 01:57:53,730
it's it's a long way to go it's it's

2436
01:57:51,139 --> 01:57:56,699
it'll be fun to see how things change

2437
01:57:53,729 --> 01:57:59,488
and I think the food products the whole

2438
01:57:56,698 --> 01:58:03,448
seed thing is really all this has been

2439
01:57:59,488 --> 01:58:05,069
the biggest interest to me it I like

2440
01:58:03,448 --> 01:58:06,899
that the fiber and I like all the

2441
01:58:05,069 --> 01:58:08,308
interesting costumes women make and all

2442
01:58:06,899 --> 01:58:10,920
that but when you hear and talk about

2443
01:58:08,309 --> 01:58:13,849
the seeds and what they're good for and

2444
01:58:10,920 --> 01:58:18,510
out they've eaten him for years and then

2445
01:58:13,849 --> 01:58:20,038
you realize that that's mostly even more

2446
01:58:18,510 --> 01:58:23,159
important especially in places that have

2447
01:58:20,038 --> 01:58:24,929
marginal supplies and oh especially in

2448
01:58:23,158 --> 01:58:26,759
areas of the world where people don't

2449
01:58:24,929 --> 01:58:28,908
have enough to eat or people are dying

2450
01:58:26,760 --> 01:58:32,190
or they're not getting a nutrition

2451
01:58:28,908 --> 01:58:35,609
enough diet that you know this can this

2452
01:58:32,189 --> 01:58:41,098
can be mium be a matter of life and

2453
01:58:35,609 --> 01:58:43,469
death for a village spirit yeah for most

2454
01:58:41,099 --> 01:58:44,849
of those places those that are starving

2455
01:58:43,469 --> 01:58:46,679
if you think about it for a minute

2456
01:58:44,849 --> 01:58:47,969
they're not places where you can grow

2457
01:58:46,679 --> 01:58:50,460
hemp so it's not like we're going to

2458
01:58:47,969 --> 01:58:52,439
have people employed grow their own food

2459
01:58:50,460 --> 01:58:53,909
it's gonna have to be an aid thing you

2460
01:58:52,439 --> 01:58:56,250
have to ship it like rice it's gonna

2461
01:58:53,909 --> 01:58:59,689
have to be grown where it's temperate

2462
01:58:56,250 --> 01:59:03,449
you know climates when that's North turn

2463
01:58:59,689 --> 01:59:05,579
North Americans your issues well right

2464
01:59:03,449 --> 01:59:09,109
now they're too busy plowing down the

2465
01:59:05,579 --> 01:59:11,969
the rainforests to make room for more

2466
01:59:09,109 --> 01:59:14,059
cattle ranches so we could have more Big

2467
01:59:11,969 --> 01:59:16,829
Macs and t-bone steaks in the world

2468
01:59:14,060 --> 01:59:20,489
underground more soybeans to feed those

2469
01:59:16,829 --> 01:59:23,340
animals to to bingo

2470
01:59:20,488 --> 01:59:25,619
yeah so what watch wallet all the

2471
01:59:23,340 --> 01:59:38,489
hempseed that should be going to human

2472
