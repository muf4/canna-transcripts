138
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:30,598
probably take uh a bunch of energy like

139
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,680
money connections a space

140
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:35,199
a rental or a purchase

141
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:36,360
agreement um probably quite a bit of

142
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,038
things but it's not like it's an

143
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,598
impossibility it could happen I know

144
00:06:38,038 --> 00:06:45,038
Vancouver could really use a bubble

145
00:06:40,598 --> 00:06:48,000

146

157
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,960
215 in Winnipeg on uh on Wednesday I

158
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,000

159
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:23,478
Weather Channel my mother sent it to me

160
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,478
made me laugh pretty hard - 27 - 26 -

161
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,399
215 exactly Patrick and Corey could use

162
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:30,038
it but I would also bring a lot of

163
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:31,478
well-known um artists I personally would

164
00:07:30,038 --> 00:07:34,318
love to throw one of the first

165
00:07:31,478 --> 00:07:35,878
Mothership shows in Vancouver and bring

166
