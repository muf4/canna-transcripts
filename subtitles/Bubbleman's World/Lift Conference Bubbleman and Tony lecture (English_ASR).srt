3
00:00:22,118 --> 00:00:26,118
boys

4
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,320
okay uh well first of all I want to

5
00:00:26,118 --> 00:00:31,359
thank everyone for coming today I am

6
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,399
Marcus Bubble Man richon I'm here with

7
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:36,320
my partner Tony vura from United

8
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:37,439
cannabis and Blue River extracts and uh

9
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,399
I guess we're going to talk to you guys

10
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:41,640
a little bit today about uh the

11
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:43,558
glandular Tricom a little bit of the

12
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,679
science of the glandular Tricom I'm

13
00:00:43,558 --> 00:00:47,759
hoping as I didn't bring a

14
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:50,198
presentation that you guys know what a

15
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:51,640
glandular Tricom looks like if you don't

16
00:00:50,198 --> 00:00:53,719
pull out your phone go on to my

17
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:56,039
Instagram account BC bubbleman I have a

18
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:57,960
ton of them on there I take extremely

19
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:00,800
closeup macro photographs of these

20
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,480
glandular tricomes and in essence they

21
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:05,399
are the essential oil secreting glands

22
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:08,200
of cannabis that secrete all of the

23
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,240
phyto canabo as well as the turpine and

24
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,960
turpenoid profile that we of course know

25
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:14,919
and love all the smells and the tastes

26
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:16,798
and so I guess I'll give you a little

27
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:19,799
bit of a history how Tony and I came

28
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:22,400
together we share um a similar Vision in

29
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:24,640
quality and in standards I've been doing

30
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,600
the bubble bags for the last 17 years

31
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,040
teaching people how to extract their

32
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:32,798
resin glands using water and ice to a

33
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,759
99% glandular Tricom head ratio uh this

34
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:38,159
is the ratio you want to acquire your

35
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:39,879
medicine as it is it is the medicine of

36
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,759
the plant people ask me all the time why

37
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:44,319
don't you smoke the actual plant and I

38
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:47,478
say well the actual plant is is like a

39
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:51,438
carrier and it carries fiber it carries

40
00:01:47,478 --> 00:01:54,359
cellulose it it carries essential oil uh

41
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:57,078
uh secreting glands it uh it produces

42
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:59,438
seed oil uh that is extremely rich in

43
00:01:57,078 --> 00:02:01,438
essential amino acids and it produces

44
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:03,359
all these things generally from the one

45
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:05,000
from the whole if we want to make paper

46
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:07,159
we take the cellulose if we want to make

47
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,399
fiber we take uh clothing we take the

48
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:12,920
fiber uh if we want to use Medicine of

49
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:14,878
course we take the glandular Tricom head

50
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:16,639
and so it was really in my passion for

51
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:19,159
following the glandular Tricom head

52
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:22,559
teaching people how to isolate it that I

53
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:25,120
met Tony who's doing very similar things

54
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,479
uh to me but in a very different way

55
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,959
Tony was responsible for founding River

56
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:31,799
Rock in Colorado with his partner he's

57
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:34,039
no longer a part of that but he was a

58
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,560
big part of it and he created some

59
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:37,400
really incredible things during that

60
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,598
time the act now program which is the

61
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,879
activated canabo Therapy Program that he

62
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:44,598
does with his Proline teaching people to

63
00:02:41,878 --> 00:02:47,199
micro do canabo suspended in tpin in

64
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:48,719
extremely small milligram Doses and

65
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:51,318
really teaching people how to saturate

66
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:55,479
the endoc canabo system rather than

67
00:02:51,318 --> 00:02:58,280
guessing with an actual visual um map or

68
00:02:55,479 --> 00:03:00,359
landscape that is created by empirical

69
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:03,120
data people feeding the data about their

70
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,920
sickness about the strains information

71
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,280
going back and forth into this program

72
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:08,399
created this digital landscape for

73
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,799
specific

74
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:15,200
cannaboid uh potencies and and levels

75
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:16,640
activated and non-activated to create

76
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:19,399
what what he's created which is The

77
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:21,238
Prana so it's really it was very much an

78
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,158
attraction for Tony and I to come

79
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:24,759
together um one of the things Tony

80
00:03:23,158 --> 00:03:27,679
started doing in the last year which

81
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:29,759
really was a path he's been on for

82
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,319
several years but really sort of EXP

83
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:33,959
loaded uh in the hash Church Forum I

84
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:35,318
don't know if any of you watch hash

85
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:37,799
Church would like to see your hands if

86
00:03:35,318 --> 00:03:39,719
you're a hash Church fan hash church is

87
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:42,120
a live YouTube show that we stream

88
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:44,598
weekly we get a thousand live viewers

89
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:47,200
watching uh maybe 15 to 20,000 in the

90
00:03:44,598 --> 00:03:49,199
first week and it's really a forum of

91
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:51,839
radical openness where we share our

92
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:54,759
ideas and we discuss uh things about

93
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,560
cannabis in a way that is very open and

94
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:59,280
allows people to learn and be a part of

95
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,120
it it's an open source sort of a program

96
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,519
and that's that's really how Tony and I

97
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,840
got brought together Tony also

98
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:06,920
represents my brand uh the bubble man

99
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,840
brand uh down in California at

100
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:10,759
Harborside and maybe you want to give us

101
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:13,079
a little uh little Lowdown on how that's

102
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:14,560
going down there yeah I was uh just

103
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:16,759
wanted to say thank you for having me

104
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,040
the last time I was here I think it was

105
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:21,479
two years ago much different type of

106
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,960
conference this was a this other one was

107
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:25,599
more of a business conference so I'm

108
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:29,079
really glad to see the uh industry

109
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,000
progress as far as it has gotten um I

110
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:32,199
understand that everyone's is still

111
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,120
going through the three tiers LP

112
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:37,439
dispensaries and individuals uh all

113
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,199
having different types of uh

114
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:41,279
constitutional rights if you will here

115
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,879
and you're finding your way so I know

116
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:46,038
it's also a hard struggle when you're

117
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:46,800
doing that I've started with this plant

118
00:04:46,038 --> 00:04:48,918
since

119
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:52,240
1996 and have been treated like a

120
00:04:48,918 --> 00:04:54,439
criminal since um my background is I

121
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,600
started when I was in a couple car

122
00:04:54,439 --> 00:05:00,240
accidents in '96 they uh prescribed the

123
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:03,199
wonderful Oxycodone to me

124
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,720
and uh I dropped about 150 lbs I

125
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:08,160
couldn't eat I couldn't sleep constantly

126
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:10,840
constipated and uh I started to smoke

127
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,720
cannabis I started to use it in Edibles

128
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:15,560
and uh was able to get myself off of

129
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,600
opiates and since '96 I have no longer

130
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:21,600
used anything not even a Tylenol uh for

131
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:23,360
my condition I was also in y thank you

132
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,879
appreciate that for those out there

133
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:30,080
using cannabis in substitute of opiates

134
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:33,159
it's 100% possible um there's quite a

135
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:36,599
bit of an illusion that goes on I don't

136
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:39,600
I don't um not subscribe to using

137
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,879
cocktails or pharmaceutical grade

138
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,800
cocktails when you're going through a

139
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:46,120
surgery back surgery you know a knee

140
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,520
surgery brain surgery heart surgery

141
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,639
probably don't want to smoke a joint

142
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:51,560
before you go to one of those surgeries

143
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:54,038
so there is uh there is a place in the

144
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,839
world for pharmaceutical types of

145
00:05:54,038 --> 00:05:59,079
cocktails or drugs that they can use in

146
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:02,719
those small short window terms but in

147
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:04,120
the long term term uh use it's it's uh

148
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,720
something that's going to break down our

149
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:08,280
body and ultimately cause a lot of side

150
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,360
effects and a lot of other conditions

151
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:12,839
and organ failures you know all kinds of

152
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,759
things that will happen to us so in the

153
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:16,318
long run we have to search out for

154
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:18,240
something that's alternative something

155
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,720
that's homeopathic something that we

156
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:24,160
could turn to First exhaust all of those

157
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,360
things so diets Foods things that we put

158
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,560
into our body anything that you feel in

159
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:31,479
the essential oilbased world I feel that

160
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,879
we as as Society should exhaust those

161
00:06:31,478 --> 00:06:35,560
first try the natural path and then

162
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:38,639
explore the other ones if you're dealing

163
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:40,319
with cancer you're dealing with um

164
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,478
life-threatening diseases and things

165
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:45,319
like that and ailments obviously I'm not

166
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:49,199
going to be the one that says uh to use

167
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:51,520
cannabis as an alternative uh for cancer

168
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:55,319
but we've have about 3,000 patients on

169
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:58,240
our current program we use uh a blended

170
00:06:55,319 --> 00:07:00,960
version of um uh ratios that are

171
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,598
suspended in fatty acids and lipids and

172
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:06,519
with the tpin with the plant fats with

173
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:08,560
these cannabinoids in raw form in active

174
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:10,918
form we're able to do them and control

175
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,319
dosages from a milligram to to 50

176
00:07:10,918 --> 00:07:15,279
milligrams in three different Delivery

177
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:17,520
Systems and we have plenty and plenty of

178
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:19,719
patients that are in remission I just

179
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:22,519
put up a story before I came here of a

180
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:25,319
leukemia uh cancer patient that didn't

181
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:26,758
have any chance whatsoever the doctor

182
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:29,759
said look we're experimenting at this

183
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:32,919
point you're going to die the kids uh uh

184
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,280
brought in our products in 3 weeks they

185
00:07:32,918 --> 00:07:36,878
released the patient he's still in

186
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:38,799
remission today from November this

187
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:40,759
happens quite a bit with cannabis and

188
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,360
it's these bioessays and these

189
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:46,280
observational datas that we can't ignore

190
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,720
and so for four years I developed an EHR

191
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:51,638
electronic health record software a

192
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:54,199
platform that's free to patients um it's

193
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:55,879
supported through nurses and doctors and

194
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:58,120
scientists one of those scientists

195
00:07:55,879 --> 00:08:00,599
actually was from Calgary uh discovered

196
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:03,079
stem cells in 1980

197
00:08:00,598 --> 00:08:05,478
um and has is one of our lead scientists

198
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:08,240
and what we wanted to do was provide

199
00:08:05,478 --> 00:08:10,399
products that were 100% plant-based that

200
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,840
utilized all of the turpine profiles

201
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:16,198
these cannabinoid profiles and delivered

202
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:18,560
it in a very uh pharmaceutical base but

203
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:20,319
taking as you say the farm out of

204
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,639
pharmaceutical and putting the farm back

205
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:25,240
in yeah taking the harm a pharmaceutical

206
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:27,038
is spelled phm if we take the harm out

207
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:31,319
of pharmaceutical and we spell the word

208
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:33,838
f a RM we can put the farm back in

209
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:37,718
Pharmaceuticals yeah so that's really

210
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:39,519
key and so you know both of our nations

211
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:42,560
are going through those Growing Pains

212
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:46,159
we've got 28 experiments going on as I

213
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:48,479
call them uh Colorado California Oregon

214
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:51,079
Seattle and the media and the news and

215
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:54,959
the PO politics they they are very

216
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:56,480
crafty in the way that they can finesse

217
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:58,278
the different messages that are out

218
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,278
there and the message is still the same

219
00:08:58,278 --> 00:09:01,838
we're still dealing with prohib I and

220
00:09:00,278 --> 00:09:04,159
we're still being treated like criminals

221
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,399
instead of patients and not only that I

222
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:07,639
I just want to interrupt for a second

223
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:09,480
Tony that it it hijacks the actual

224
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:11,319
medicinal component of the plant when

225
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:14,680
you you don't understand it the people

226
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:16,560
that are putting these these laws into

227
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:18,439
into play they don't understand where

228
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:20,479
the actual medicinal components of the

229
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:22,519
plant actually are so they're looking at

230
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,920
it much the way a Prohibition based

231
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:25,639
grower would have looked at it back in

232
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:27,559
the day which is how much can I get and

233
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:29,519
how fast can I get it and these aren't

234
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:31,159
really conducive thought patterns to a

235
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,839
medical program or even really a

236
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:34,879
preventative or in my opinion even a

237
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:36,560
good wreck program it's just not the

238
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:39,078
vibe for us to be coming from yeah and

239
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:41,879
when we talk about standards I my

240
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:43,399
background is engineering so I like to

241
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:46,039
break things down in

242
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:49,839
systems and I also like to relate them

243
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:52,159
to the end end use so as a patient I've

244
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,959
also been growing since '96 I stopped

245
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:56,600
growing six years ago because all of my

246
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:59,838
friends grow and they grow very well I

247
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:01,839
subscribe to sungrown uh live soil te

248
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:04,000
Brew everything that you can possibly

249
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:08,079
make organic because it kind of defeats

250
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,399
the purpose of using this product in a

251
00:10:08,078 --> 00:10:13,359
chemical format I'm not against

252
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:16,360
hydrocarbons or CO2 or things like that

253
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:19,639
but this is where Marcus and I our bond

254
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:21,720
has really really came together was I

255
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:23,879
was first a patient I discovered

256
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:26,759
cannabis worked for me and then many

257
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:28,838
years later the United States said hey I

258
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:31,919
think we have an opportunity for people

259
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:33,920
to do this legally in a medical platform

260
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:35,439
so I became obsessed with how do I make

261
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:38,919
enough medicine to help other people

262
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:41,560
like me and I came uh across photographs

263
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:43,319
of these tricomes and so if you're

264
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:45,638
obsessed with your medicine you want to

265
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:48,320
see the details if you're an engineer

266
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:49,959
and so I started seeing these pictures

267
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,720
of these triome heads and I was like oh

268
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:54,399
my god there it is it's like a grae but

269
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,600
it's blown up you couldn't see them cuz

270
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,159
they were so small and I'm like who is

271
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,920
this guy and there's like these

272
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:01,360
unbelievable photograph s that I could

273
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:03,399
never do you can't do it with your phone

274
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,680
you can't do it with your camera and I'm

275
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:07,559
a I'm into photography so I'm like you

276
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:12,000
know exploring this and then I one day I

277
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:14,919
got a 2,000 micros 2000 Zoom microscope

278
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,519
and we cut a Tricom head in half and we

279
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:19,360
looked at it and that triome head

280
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:22,078
actually had a brain and it looked like

281
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,959
a whole bunch of like uh vessels inside

282
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:26,559
it like the human brain let's talk about

283
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:27,719
that a little bit yeah let's we got uh a

284
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:29,759
lot of you guys came to hear a little

285
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:32,120
bit of Science of the glandular Tri and

286
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:34,319
cannabis so we know that all of the

287
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:36,278
cannabinoids are biosynthesized inside

288
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,760
the glandular triome head as long as the

289
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:40,200
T as well as the Turpin and the

290
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:41,879
terpenoids there are six varieties of

291
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,440
tricomes I won't go through them all

292
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:44,838
right now but the three most popular

293
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,839
ones are the bulbus which are little

294
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:48,720
round balls that lay on the leaves

295
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:50,519
they're high in a different level of

296
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,759
cannabinoids than just THC and they

297
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:55,039
happen to be the the glandular head that

298
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:58,000
is responsible for oil yields being so

299
00:11:55,039 --> 00:12:00,679
much higher uh than say water extraction

300
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,278
or dry sifting mechanical separation and

301
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:03,958
the reason is is because these heads are

302
00:12:02,278 --> 00:12:06,278
so small they're attached to the leaf

303
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:07,958
they don't break the same way they don't

304
00:12:06,278 --> 00:12:09,838
uh isolate the same way when using

305
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:12,119
mechanical separations or when using

306
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,440
water extraction which obviously freezes

307
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:16,799
the wax membrane and breaks the head the

308
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:19,079
density of the triome is still affected

309
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:20,799
by gravity due to its its density and

310
00:12:19,078 --> 00:12:23,359
its oil makeup so it sinks while

311
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:27,359
everything else floats so inside this

312
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:30,399
glandular triome head we have we have uh

313
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,199
organal basically vac walls and plastids

314
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:35,639
they're two little Chambers inside the

315
00:12:32,198 --> 00:12:37,879
head and they create phenols and tpes

316
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:40,399
and those phenols and tpin one in the

317
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:43,000
plastids one in the vacols they're all

318
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,799
different types of organal they push up

319
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,159
into the upper membrane and that's what

320
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:49,599
you would have seen when you cut that

321
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:51,719
Tricom in half that that fibrous mat is

322
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,560
where the phenols and the Turpin are

323
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,199
pushed up into the upper cuticle of the

324
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:57,719
glandular triome head and it's through

325
00:12:55,198 --> 00:12:59,599
UVB light that the cannabinoids are

326
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:02,839
actually cooked into existence first

327
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:05,079
with CBG and then it goes from CBG on

328
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:07,399
through a variety of cannaboids CBN is

329
00:13:05,078 --> 00:13:10,439
not produced by the cannabis plant it's

330
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:12,120
a biodegradable canabo when it when it

331
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:14,360
goes down and it starts falling apart

332
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:17,600
and degrading it turns into CBN but

333
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:20,759
cbn's not actually a a a canabo that you

334
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,920
will see in a living plant by testing so

335
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:23,319
just thought I'd lay a little bit of the

336
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:24,838
science on them maybe we could talk a

337
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,480
little bit about those Tes in there well

338
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:29,480
let's let's talk about the uh how those

339
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:32,000
are evolved so prohibition base based

340
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:34,480
growing methods I've done it we've all

341
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,919
done it we grow using metal highlights

342
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:41,199
or High Press sodium um we we you know

343
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:44,639
I've started and did three parts Hydro

344
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:47,919
System I did a drip system deep water

345
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:49,680
culture system I've done Aero aeroponics

346
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:51,719
how about aquaponics aquaponics get

347
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:53,599
right after Arrow I hope after AO and

348
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:56,240
then ultimately at the end of the day it

349
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,040
comes back to soil I know it's it's you

350
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:02,799
know everyone like tries to find ways to

351
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:04,319
get away from the Sun and away from soil

352
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:07,278
but I always tell everyone that's like

353
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,720
so you're raw you're vegan you eat

354
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:11,759
everything organic farm to table so how

355
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:14,079
many of those things were actually grown

356
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:15,120
indoors all your vegetables all the

357
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:16,799
things that you're eating that you're

358
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,000
putting into your body are you throwing

359
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:21,799
them in your closet are you growing your

360
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,958
micronutrients under just a shop light I

361
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:26,120
mean because then wouldn't that limit

362
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:27,799
the ability for that fruit or those

363
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:29,799
herbs or those vegetables to really

364
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:32,519
mature into what it's supposed to to do

365
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:34,679
which is really code it's code for what

366
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:36,519
we put into our body so when we put

367
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:38,719
these things into our body we either

368
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:43,360
have an interference pattern meaning

369
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:46,639
fats inflammations sugars glucose uh you

370
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,919
know whites breads rice all of these

371
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,720
different things that we put into our

372
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:52,759
body we're all different we all process

373
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:54,839
them differently and so if we don't Dr

374
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:58,480
Grow those herbs or those vegetables or

375
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:59,959
those nutrients to True Value and we try

376
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,879
to put them into our body we're cheating

377
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:04,879
ourselves yeah so if we all ate an

378
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:07,399
orange together and we peeled open the

379
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:09,600
orange and we didn't smell anything and

380
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:11,440
it didn't taste like an orange chances

381
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,759
are it doesn't have lyine and chances

382
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,680
are there's no vitamin C in it so what

383
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:18,720
are we doing we're eating a 3D printed

384
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:20,638
orange and you know why we're

385
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,240
carbohydrates and sugars what the hell

386
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,440
is that the reason we're doing it

387
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,560
is because we were duped by prohibition

388
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:28,639
we thought okay prohibition is bad but

389
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:30,518
we're going to do it anyway and what we

390
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,240
did was was we we fell into this

391
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:33,919
mentality where we would see how much we

392
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,600
could get and how fast we could get it

393
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:37,399
and we limited the cannabinoids and the

394
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,480
tpin that were being produced in these

395
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:41,399
plants and I guarantee you when we get

396
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:43,920
back to land race cultivars and we start

397
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:46,839
breeding the land race strains back into

398
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:48,759
our our our uh platform here we're going

399
00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:50,519
to see canabo that we haven't seen in

400
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:53,079
decades and we're going to see tpin that

401
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:55,039
we haven't seen there's 140 plus Turpin

402
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:57,239
in the cannabis plant that can be

403
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:59,278
produced plus about another 40 that have

404
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:05,079
never been identified so that's close to

405
00:15:59,278 --> 00:16:07,799
200 most Labs test for 12 to 24 tpin and

406
00:16:05,078 --> 00:16:10,359
that's because only about 12 of them

407
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:13,240
repeat over and over and over again and

408
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:15,759
I can guarantee you that has so much to

409
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:18,639
do with the way we've grown cannabis

410
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:20,600
indoor under this prohibition mentality

411
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,240
yeah so if you look at that and I have

412
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:24,079
nothing against indoor growing

413
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,959
operations whatsoever there's plenty of

414
00:16:24,078 --> 00:16:29,638
them that are good but we have to look

415
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:31,239
at what's being grown leaf or resin so

416
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:33,839
that's great if you grow three lbs a

417
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:35,240
plant but what was your resin content

418
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,120
that means hey right away if someone

419
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:39,079
tells me they grew three lounds of plant

420
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,600
I know they're growing for plant because

421
00:16:39,078 --> 00:16:42,479
anyone that was growing for resin would

422
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:45,440
tell me they got 2 and 1/2 ounces of

423
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,480
resin not 3 lbs of plant correct are you

424
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,800
growing for resin the medicinal Compound

425
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:52,440
on your plant or are you growing for you

426
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:54,078
know to pay your mortgage and to pay

427
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,880
your car payments which is you know

428
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:58,439
unfortunately it's the situation we find

429
00:16:55,879 --> 00:17:00,078
ourselves in right now with you know I'm

430
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,959
an act I come from an activist

431
00:17:00,078 --> 00:17:04,480
standpoint I I fought for hemp to be

432
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:06,159
legalized and grown legally in my in my

433
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,439
province in Manitoba we got our first

434
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,279
hemp license in 1995 and have never

435
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:13,319
stopped growing it there I've been

436
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:15,720
deeply involved in this industry and uh

437
00:17:13,318 --> 00:17:18,240
I just I think it's unfortunate to see

438
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:21,240
the way the legal mechanisms and the

439
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:24,000
illegal mechanisms are unable to

440
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:25,759
somehow meld together and work together

441
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,519
it's all this it's Health Canada in the

442
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:30,319
middle convincing dispensaries to hate

443
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:32,639
LPS and LPS to hate dispensaries and we

444
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:34,879
really really really need to stop doing

445
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,840
that because the only way to conquer a

446
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:40,160
people is to divide them and we do not

447
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:41,879
need to be divided LPS and dispensaries

448
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,558
are doing the same great job they're

449
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:46,280
giving access to patients and that's

450
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:48,079
something we need so I just wanted to

451
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:51,000
kind of say that a little outside of the

452
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:53,798
science version that's okay it all comes

453
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:57,159
together right absolutely so when you

454
00:17:53,798 --> 00:18:00,440
look at I've grown we've grown uh in my

455
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:01,440
experience I would say 500 lb a month

456
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:03,798
for the

457
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:07,038
last I don't know I did that for like 6

458
00:18:03,798 --> 00:18:10,119
years 300 lights indoors 20,000 square

459
00:18:07,038 --> 00:18:11,679
foot in green houses and now as it's

460
00:18:10,119 --> 00:18:14,558
evolving I'm getting more away from that

461
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:16,400
and just focusing on processing resin

462
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:18,639
into products because that's really

463
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,280
where my passion is but really when I

464
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,559
look at it and I pull the pull back and

465
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:24,639
I say okay what's really the best form

466
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:28,038
for this plant for growing the medicine

467
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:30,480
and the Turpin it's sungrown Greenhouse

468
00:18:28,038 --> 00:18:32,158
all organic with supplemental lighting

469
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,279
that is the future of cannabis whether

470
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:35,640
you like it or not and the reason why is

471
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:37,639
because ultimately when you find

472
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:39,640
something that works and we produce a

473
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:41,679
medicine for people we have to get it

474
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:43,880
insured we have to do it on such a

475
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:46,240
massive level and we have to standardize

476
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:48,720
it and we need to do it organically and

477
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,400
so those things come together and that's

478
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,159
really what the what the key is and so

479
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:55,159
the best price per pound for your resin

480
00:18:53,159 --> 00:18:57,400
is going to be in in a controlled

481
00:18:55,159 --> 00:18:59,720
Greenhouse environment however that may

482
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:01,360
look and the reason why I subscribe to

483
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:04,558
that is because I'm looking at turine

484
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:08,079
profiles so our booth was set up today

485
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:11,119
with uh we had over I think 20 I've done

486
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:12,918
over 51 different tarpine profiles today

487
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:16,038
we had like 12 of them available I think

488
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:17,640
we're down to four but what this was is

489
00:19:16,038 --> 00:19:20,200
capturing those essential oils and the

490
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:22,360
turpins from those tricomb heads and

491
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:24,880
doing them from flowers without any

492
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:27,000
solvents it's kind of like if you took

493
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:30,720
like a grape and you had to figure out

494
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:33,759
how to pop the grape and take the inside

495
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,319
out without any THC and you just wanted

496
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:37,440
to take the essence and without leaving

497
00:19:35,319 --> 00:19:38,918
a footprint which is very very difficult

498
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,840
it's where the intellectual property

499
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:43,200
comes into play it's and it's you should

500
00:19:40,839 --> 00:19:45,279
really sort of point out the difference

501
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,519
between the indoor grown Turpin versus

502
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:50,000
those sungrown Greenhouse tpin yeah so

503
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:52,679
what I've what I've just in my

504
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:56,038
experience is running a uh let's say you

505
00:19:52,679 --> 00:20:00,080
run tpine extractions on flowers grown

506
00:19:56,038 --> 00:20:03,200
Su grown tpine FL extractions grown

507
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:05,480
indoors big wide range so everything

508
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:09,200
I've grown in Sun grown

509
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:10,759
ACDC uh a cavello sour diesel um you

510
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:15,519
start pulling these profiles from the

511
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:17,960
outdoor strains we see 10 12 13 of the

512
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:20,000
tpin that are in the in the grid pattern

513
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21,200
of the DNA if you will you can come the

514
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,038
booth and check these out if you want to

515
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:26,519
see got them all printed for you 6 so

516
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:28,839
you'll see like 10 12 13 11 you'll see

517
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:31,879
wide spectrums full spectrums of tping

518
00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:34,399
you'll see eucalyptol you'll see loning

519
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:36,360
you'll see lenol you'll see pining

520
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,120
you'll see different types of pining and

521
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:41,959
each type of cultivar each type of

522
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:44,678
strain leaves a DNA in these tpin and so

523
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:47,960
we can we now have been testing the flow

524
00:20:44,679 --> 00:20:50,320
the flower rosin the flower next to the

525
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,919
hash so you look at full Mount then we

526
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:53,839
press out the full Mount so we're able

527
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:56,960
to look at the full Mount and those

528
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:59,798
tpine profiles the rosin and those tpine

529
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:02,159
profiles and the tpin of the original

530
00:20:59,798 --> 00:21:04,400
flowers next to the flowers so you can

531
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:06,840
compare kind of track all the way down

532
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:09,440
and when you do that you discover that

533
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:11,199
when you're growing indoor and you're

534
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,759
you you have to look at what your lights

535
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,440
are and you have to look at what you're

536
00:21:12,759 --> 00:21:18,038
feeding so if you're growing in gavitas

537
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:20,360
or papies or you're growing under

538
00:21:18,038 --> 00:21:24,079
hlc uh or

539
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:25,759
hplc high pressure sodium um if you're

540
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:27,798
growing under these different spectrums

541
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:30,278
these different spectrums are going to

542
00:21:27,798 --> 00:21:32,599
allow that plant to express differently

543
00:21:30,278 --> 00:21:35,119
exactly a perfect example of this is if

544
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:37,199
you understand lavender the herb where

545
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:38,678
is the best lavender grown people that

546
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,679
don't even know about lavender will

547
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:42,519
often see it on the package French

548
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:45,360
lavender there's a region in France

549
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:48,079
where lavender grows this incredible

550
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:49,719
turine profile it happens to do with how

551
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:51,839
high they are away from up from the

552
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:53,360
ocean you know it's all altitude and and

553
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:55,240
the the soil and it's all these

554
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:56,959
variables and it's a very important

555
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,720
thing to note and and before Tony gets

556
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,679
back to the tping I just want to explain

557
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,278
you guys in case some of you really are

558
00:22:00,679 --> 00:22:05,679
more of a coming from a newb standpoint

559
00:22:03,278 --> 00:22:08,720
like a newbie in all of this is that

560
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:10,640
phyto canabo um you know help regulate

561
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,759
our endoc canabo system which helps

562
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,960
regulate our biological functions we

563
00:22:12,759 --> 00:22:18,000
have CB1 and CB2 receptors in our brain

564
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,960
and peripheral organs and depending on

565
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,038
the deficiency that our endoc canabo

566
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:24,558
system may use we can use a variety of

567
00:22:22,038 --> 00:22:25,879
these uh canabo in different ratios

568
00:22:24,558 --> 00:22:27,879
which is you know one more time to

569
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:30,159
reiterate and I I don't own shares in

570
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:31,760
this company uh I'm the the part the

571
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:34,240
part that I'm involved with United

572
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:35,759
cannabis is we are Partners in Jamaica

573
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,240
together but other than that everything

574
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:40,679
he does in America is his own thing and

575
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:43,079
uh it's not guessing they are not

576
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:44,798
guessing about ratios and seeing Oh try

577
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:46,639
this try this they are creating a

578
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:49,720
digital landscape with the act now

579
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:52,640
program and that is unbelievable it's

580
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:54,440
not a guess it's more like much more

581
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,440
accurate based because it's based on

582
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:58,720
actual evidence from people that suffer

583
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:00,360
from the same sickness and I just kind

584
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,200
of wanted to let people know a little

585
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:04,879
bit about that and realize why are we

586
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:08,120
extracting these tpin because about 12

587
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:10,320
years ago one of my mentors skunkman Sam

588
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:15,038
he uh acquired some pure cannabinoids

589
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:18,119
CBG CBD CBN and pure thca uh from a

590
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:19,599
laboratory in Amsterdam and we went over

591
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:21,000
to his place and he was like Hey you

592
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:23,399
know you got to try this out you can hit

593
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
this pure thca in a pipe and I hid it

594
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:27,360
and it was very one-dimensional very

595
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,038
heavy set heavy in my eyes not really

596
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:31,119
what I would call an enjoyable social

597
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:33,400
experience uh but then he said hey I

598
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:35,558
also have these pure tpes uh they're not

599
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:38,038
derived from Cannabis but they are pure

600
00:23:35,558 --> 00:23:40,639
analytical tpin and there's delemon and

601
00:23:38,038 --> 00:23:42,798
there's uh terpinolene and there's uh

602
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,520
pinene he had a four or five different

603
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:47,798
ones and he said why don't you now try

604
00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:50,679
that thca but take one drop of this

605
00:23:47,798 --> 00:23:52,519
turpine and this revelatory experience

606
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:54,640
occurred that we realized that the

607
00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:56,679
modulating effects from Cannabis come

608
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:59,559
more from the tpine profiles than the

609
00:23:56,679 --> 00:24:02,000
actual ratios of phyto can aboid so

610
00:23:59,558 --> 00:24:04,359
while everyone's trying to sell you CBD

611
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:08,319
and and and different ratios of CBD and

612
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:10,798
THC we were more focused on what directs

613
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:13,038
those compounds because I understand

614
00:24:10,798 --> 00:24:15,839
those compounds are the gas they make

615
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:17,960
you go but the Turpin are your steering

616
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:20,639
wheel and they direct that and when you

617
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:22,840
can induce an appetite or a different

618
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,880
medicinal component out of a plant that

619
00:24:22,839 --> 00:24:27,678
otherwise didn't give you that by

620
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:30,120
modulating it with tpin that is some

621
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:32,360
next level go ahead yeah see if I

622
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:33,678
could tie that together to what he was

623
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:36,759
talking about cuz a lot of people

624
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:39,240
probably don't know what act now is so

625
00:24:36,759 --> 00:24:40,960
we'll get to that but first how we're

626
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42,640
breaking down these turpins was first

627
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,880
looking at them in Full Spectrum in

628
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:47,440
their cultivars comparing them and how

629
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:51,240
they're being made and I just saw a lot

630
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:53,640
of uh differences between Sun grown uh

631
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:55,679
Sun assisted versus say indoor

632
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:58,440
onedimensional type of light instead of

633
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:00,640
seeing 10 and 12 turpine profiles you

634
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:03,120
might say three or four or you might see

635
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:07,159
five only and it would be concentrated

636
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:10,558
on that and so uh this is a really

637
00:25:07,159 --> 00:25:13,360
unexplored territory but what we've what

638
00:25:10,558 --> 00:25:15,759
what's what it's led us to is saying

639
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:17,759
okay from what we know which has also

640
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:20,000
changed in the last three years most

641
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:24,200
people look at Cannabis sativa cannabis

642
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:26,640
indicia and hemp and so the vernacular

643
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:29,038
of that isn't really true so it's

644
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:31,360
afghanan in indic

645
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:34,000
drug type varieties and Cannabis sativa

646
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:36,119
is a hemp variety and this has been

647
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,079
something that's been changed as of the

648
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:40,678
last few years Robert Clark and

649
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:43,158
different individuals have uh expressed

650
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:45,240
their input on this and this is

651
00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:48,240
important because drug cultivars meaning

652
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:49,720
things that produce resinous uh tricomes

653
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,319
is what we're talking about that carries

654
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:54,880
the tpin and hemp varieties lack the

655
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:56,519
sophistication of these turpine profiles

656
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,559
and so it's a part of their survival so

657
00:25:56,519 --> 00:26:01,000
they're producing they're producing male

658
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:04,038
and female they're cross-pollinating and

659
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,960
their intentions are not driven in the

660
00:26:04,038 --> 00:26:08,278
same secretions in the oils and they

661
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:11,720
definitely don't have the full profiles

662
00:26:08,278 --> 00:26:13,599
of those tpin and so that also lack of

663
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:16,159
sophistication in my opinion in what

664
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:18,918
I've seen so far and the data is lacking

665
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:22,278
in in indoor indoor does a great job

666
00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:25,120
raising THC levels um and you see spikes

667
00:26:22,278 --> 00:26:28,398
of different types of cannabinoid CBG

668
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:32,678
thcv um and and spikes of CBD when

669
00:26:28,398 --> 00:26:34,959
you're outside even CBG uh a and so all

670
00:26:32,679 --> 00:26:37,278
of these types of cannabinoids are being

671
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,038
produced on these types of varieties and

672
00:26:37,278 --> 00:26:41,119
the turpins that are involved in them

673
00:26:39,038 --> 00:26:42,640
have to do with the genetics and so the

674
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:44,398
Breeders that are out there and good

675
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,240
breeders that know what they're doing

676
00:26:44,398 --> 00:26:47,759
they're going to be breeding for turpine

677
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:51,399
profiles and they're going to be

678
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:53,038
breeding for resinous profiles exctly so

679
00:26:51,398 --> 00:26:56,239
the what's happened is our world has

680
00:26:53,038 --> 00:26:58,480
gone from smoking to concentrates or

681
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,000
extracts that then go into medicine and

682
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:03,599
those people that are making the

683
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,480
extracts are going to tell you uh what's

684
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:08,119
what what happened and so when somebody

685
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:10,240
says hey I grew this Sour Diesel outside

686
00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:12,879
and you run it and you get an 8% yield

687
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,960
on flowers you go oh what happened and

688
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,679
they go what do you mean what happened

689
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:18,159
I'm like yeah I'm sorry did you have a

690
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:19,919
drought at uh week five to week seven

691
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:21,679
did something happen with uh your

692
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:24,120
phospherous cut out towards the end

693
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:25,640
right or you overfed or you had this and

694
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:27,398
I start breaking down what happened to

695
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:29,919
their crop from the footprint of the

696
00:27:27,398 --> 00:27:32,599
tpine profile or from the footprint of

697
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:35,720
the resin that we extracted in in bubble

698
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:37,918
hash so it doesn't lie and so those

699
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:40,720
yields tell me what what's going on and

700
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:42,559
you collect that data and

701
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:45,360
ultimately you need to know how to

702
00:27:42,558 --> 00:27:47,440
translate the data and so for for what

703
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:49,439
you call newbies and P and and patients

704
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,640
that are trying to find their way

705
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:54,720
hunting down strains and now hunting

706
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:56,559
down turpine profiles complicates the

707
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,798
process even more when you're looking

708
00:27:56,558 --> 00:28:02,319
for results and so my engineer brain

709
00:27:59,798 --> 00:28:04,839
decided to say okay let's create

710
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:07,839
categories five simple categories which

711
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:10,199
is P1 2 3 four and five and in those

712
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:13,519
categories we categorize them really

713
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:15,759
simply put P1 is going to be all of your

714
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:17,000
what everyone knows as Cannabis sativa

715
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:19,558
but that would be your Jacks and your

716
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:22,679
geran poisons your sour D's things with

717
00:28:19,558 --> 00:28:26,079
high loning things with high tpine t

718
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:27,679
terpinolene uh beta beta caropine the

719
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:29,879
names are going to be the categories

720
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:31,759
only in the future patients need to know

721
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:34,480
and it was Chimera who mentioned this on

722
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:36,839
hash Church um that the constituents of

723
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:39,360
the plant what make up the plant or the

724
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:40,759
resin is going to be what the name is if

725
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:42,079
you're a patient you want to know what

726
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:44,278
Turpin you're getting you want to know

727
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:46,960
the ratio of cannabinoids I don't care

728
00:28:44,278 --> 00:28:49,359
if you call it Jack Flash I want to know

729
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:51,319
what tpin and what cannaboids are in the

730
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:53,479
end product and that's definitely going

731
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:55,439
to be the future of cannabis names will

732
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:57,200
always be there but the true name in my

733
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,679
opinion is going to be the constituents

734
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:02,159
that make up what you're using medically

735
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:05,000
and why are cannabis cannabis Drive tpin

736
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:07,200
important well if we know there's 140

737
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,798
something of these can uh turpins and we

738
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,159
know there's an extra 30 out there that

739
00:29:08,798 --> 00:29:14,119
are unknown and lavender is

740
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:16,240
one-dimensional so that flower produces

741
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:18,439
it produces one type of turpine really

742
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,359
well and cannabis being one of those

743
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:22,558
first plants on Earth that things

744
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:25,359
evolved from different species like Hops

745
00:29:22,558 --> 00:29:28,240
and things like that they have vast

746
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:30,959
complex uh tpine profiles so this is

747
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,880
undiscovered chosen by us our noses that

748
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,720
chose those Tarin over thousands of

749
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:37,039
years it was this old factory that

750
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:39,000
smelled the ones we liked it wasn't the

751
00:29:37,038 --> 00:29:41,200
plant looking a certain way that made us

752
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,519
like it I guarantee you if you go back a

753
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,319
thousand years it was our noses it was

754
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:48,038
the turpine profiles and some of those

755
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:50,519
tpine profiles are act as incent

756
00:29:48,038 --> 00:29:53,119
repellants um some of those tpen act as

757
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:56,640
nutrients some of those uh tpine

758
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:58,918
profiles uh have different solvent they

759
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,679
can act as solvents but what's important

760
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:02,840
is to know where they where they belong

761
00:30:00,679 --> 00:30:06,679
as far as classification so if beta

762
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:08,759
carene we know turns on CB2 receptor

763
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:11,360
that's really important because that's

764
00:30:08,759 --> 00:30:13,480
really the gas for that particular

765
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:17,959
receptor and so if we know we're putting

766
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:20,919
10 Mig of CBD or 10 Mig of THC and we're

767
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:24,000
modulating with you know a particular

768
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:25,720
profile that has high beta uh caropine

769
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,200
then we know we're going to press that

770
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:29,079
then what is it carrying with us so does

771
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,798
it have mercine does does it have pining

772
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:32,759
and then how much cannaboids does it

773
00:30:30,798 --> 00:30:34,759
have then we go a step further and we

774
00:30:32,759 --> 00:30:37,798
say okay that's great so you're saying I

775
00:30:34,759 --> 00:30:38,839
can eat tpin and I can eat this bud and

776
00:30:37,798 --> 00:30:41,038
that's going to and that's going to

777
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:42,439
solve my problems absolutely not

778
00:30:41,038 --> 00:30:43,798
necessarily but it's going to turn on

779
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:45,679
especially if you have that beta carry

780
00:30:43,798 --> 00:30:47,759
offine you're going to turn on that CB2

781
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:49,600
receptor and when we talk about these

782
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:51,960
receptors some of the receptors are on

783
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:53,240
our brain in our central nervous system

784
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:55,880
and some of them in our peripheral

785
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:58,159
organs so if you've got a liver cancer

786
00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:00,080
and you're turning on your CB1 receptors

787
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:01,799
that not not might be the ideal way for

788
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:03,879
you to go about saturating your endoc

789
00:31:01,798 --> 00:31:05,119
canabo system because the CB2 receptors

790
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:07,919
are the ones you're going to need to

791
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:10,199
engage to get those cannabinoids to

792
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:12,440
communicate with those cells to produce

793
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:14,360
apoptosis to kill the mitochondria of

794
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:16,038
those cancerous cells uh Christina

795
00:31:14,359 --> 00:31:17,759
Sanchez from the University of Madrid if

796
00:31:16,038 --> 00:31:19,519
you want to write that name down she's

797
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:23,798
done some absolutely incredible work in

798
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:25,679
regards to apoptosis and and THC yeah so

799
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:27,679
absolutely there's individuals on this

800
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:29,880
planet that have inspired myself and

801
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:32,639
like Marcus you've got Sanchez you've

802
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:36,799
got Dr marzo uh that's International

803
00:31:32,638 --> 00:31:38,319
canono research out of Italy um Mula all

804
00:31:36,798 --> 00:31:39,720
of these people have been identifying

805
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:41,720
these receptors now what we know is

806
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:44,240
we've got like four of them on the board

807
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:46,240
but there's thousands of them and with

808
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,079
cannabis we've got this large spectrum

809
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,558
of turpins that are that are being

810
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:52,319
pinged and so we want to know what they

811
00:31:50,558 --> 00:31:56,319
do and how they act we know what they do

812
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:58,519
in uh Foods vitamin A is a tpine we know

813
00:31:56,319 --> 00:32:00,000
what that does to our body and and so

814
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:01,839
we're discovering these things in

815
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,798
cannabis and what's important is in the

816
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:07,038
beginning is put them into grids and so

817
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:09,319
the uh what Marcus is talking about this

818
00:32:07,038 --> 00:32:11,359
evolved into what I call Advanced canabo

819
00:32:09,319 --> 00:32:12,638
therapies so if you wanted to look it up

820
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:14,798
it's actnow

821
00:32:12,638 --> 00:32:17,079
program.com and it's a free service for

822
00:32:14,798 --> 00:32:19,879
patients in the US and since they didn't

823
00:32:17,079 --> 00:32:21,199
do any insurance I just said it I

824
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:23,320
hate to Hate to use that kind of

825
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,919
language but at some point you get over

826
00:32:23,319 --> 00:32:27,079
it and when it's a it it's a

827
00:32:24,919 --> 00:32:29,440
it it's a it because at some point

828
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:31,119
you have to say how do we help people

829
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:33,038
and how do we follow up with them so I

830
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:36,038
created a program that's hippoc

831
00:32:33,038 --> 00:32:38,480
compliant EHR software that has nurses

832
00:32:36,038 --> 00:32:40,638
running it that tracks patients results

833
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,360
and you get free Consulting and we learn

834
00:32:40,638 --> 00:32:45,119
how and and we teach you how to use

835
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:46,959
these different categories P1 through P5

836
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:49,398
with different type of ratios with

837
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:52,639
different types of full spectrum flour

838
00:32:49,398 --> 00:32:55,000
and resin uh derived uh products they're

839
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:57,599
infused not extracted active and

840
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,278
non-active in raw form and in active

841
00:32:57,599 --> 00:33:02,599
form form and some people would be like

842
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:06,319
why would you give me the raw form of

843
00:33:02,599 --> 00:33:08,359
thca and cbda together well most doctors

844
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:11,720
and scientists they think that it has to

845
00:33:08,359 --> 00:33:13,119
be activated so our Edibles RSO all of

846
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:15,759
these types of oils that we're putting

847
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:16,918
into our body in its activated form is

848
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:19,398
what they're thinking is actually

849
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:21,440
pinging the CB2 receptor so what happens

850
00:33:19,398 --> 00:33:24,918
when you eat an edible a 10 milligram

851
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:26,399
edible it's a long chain uh and the way

852
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:28,038
and the way that works it get broken

853
00:33:26,398 --> 00:33:30,079
down in your small intestin large and

854
00:33:28,038 --> 00:33:33,278
goes through the liver and so if we're

855
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:35,599
eating it or if we're eating raw THC oil

856
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:38,919
or we're eating Edibles we have about a

857
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:42,398
95% loss in bioavailability so there's

858
00:33:38,919 --> 00:33:46,080
5% bioavailability so if I'm eating a 10

859
00:33:42,398 --> 00:33:48,599
migr edible it feels like .5 mgram and

860
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:50,480
so on our website that we put on there

861
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:52,759
we have not only the services and the

862
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:54,679
programs on there we have links to

863
00:33:52,759 --> 00:33:56,720
scholar scholarly articles and

864
00:33:54,679 --> 00:33:58,240
Publications cuz many patients are

865
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:01,360
always looking for proof Pro and

866
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:05,278
evidence in pancreatic cancer breast

867
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:06,638
cancer um id1 Gene peroration of THC so

868
00:34:05,278 --> 00:34:09,878
I put all of the reports that I could

869
00:34:06,638 --> 00:34:12,039
find out there the Entourage effect um

870
00:34:09,878 --> 00:34:13,799
how Tarpin work with those things you

871
00:34:12,039 --> 00:34:15,119
know the only thing I wanted to add is

872
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,760
Tony's saying a lot of stuff that some

873
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:18,559
of you may understand and some may not

874
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:20,919
when he says activated we're merely

875
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:24,039
talking about removing a carboxilic acid

876
00:34:20,918 --> 00:34:27,398
ring from the thca molecule or the cbda

877
00:34:24,039 --> 00:34:32,039
molecule all canabo come in acid form so

878
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:34,279
they they are THC a CBD a cbga a it's a

879
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:36,960
carboxilic acid ring that can be removed

880
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:38,440
with a certain amount of heat uh applied

881
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,720
so that's what he means by he uh

882
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:42,159
activated uh thca is obviously

883
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:45,118
non-activated but there's still

884
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:47,280
medicinal benefits and THC minus the

885
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:48,760
carboxilic acid ring is activated and

886
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,960
you're going to feel the effects when

887
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:52,560
you eat it when you put it on your skin

888
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,398
smoke a joint as soon as you light the

889
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:56,480
lighter you're activating it that's it

890
00:34:54,398 --> 00:34:59,199
the fire activates it most of the most

891
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:02,280
of like most most people didn't

892
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:04,480
understand that uh Courtney was uh

893
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:07,079
christe no no no the uh the guy that

894
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:09,519
does the juicing oh uh William Courtney

895
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:12,039
William Courtney Dr William Courtney he

896
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:14,519
was a inspiration for me a while ago you

897
00:35:12,039 --> 00:35:17,960
look at someone juicing leaves right and

898
00:35:14,519 --> 00:35:19,239
juicing THC buds to get the thca so

899
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,720
William Courtney just to tell you a

900
00:35:19,239 --> 00:35:23,118
quick little bit before Tony gets into

901
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:24,480
it is he had a 3 and 1 12month old baby

902
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:26,320
patient who was suffering with a brain

903
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,039
tumor the size of a small potato in her

904
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:30,160
head it was splitting the left and right

905
00:35:28,039 --> 00:35:31,880
hemispheres of her brain and the the

906
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:33,879
chemotherapy was for sure going to kill

907
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:35,559
her and so they started juicing cannabis

908
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:37,640
and giving her cannabis and I guess it

909
00:35:35,559 --> 00:35:39,279
wasis it was a couple of months two or

910
00:35:37,639 --> 00:35:40,960
three months and they Shrunk the tumor

911
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:43,519
so far out of existence that they

912
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:45,679
decided that an MRI would be unnecessary

913
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:48,320
radiation for her so she's in remission

914
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:49,838
and has no tumor now it is amazing and I

915
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,760
want to say you know the reason we don't

916
00:35:49,838 --> 00:35:54,719
hear doctors saying this is because

917
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:56,599
every doctor will tell you I cannot say

918
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:58,118
that they will lose their license if

919
00:35:56,599 --> 00:36:00,480
they say that but the fact of the matter

920
00:35:58,119 --> 00:36:02,559
is we as a people cannot ignore this

921
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,079
information and Tony and I won't lose

922
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:06,838
if we tell you that it can shrink

923
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:09,160
tumors that's right so we will so how so

924
00:36:06,838 --> 00:36:11,159
then I said okay well everyone's a

925
00:36:09,159 --> 00:36:14,159
little different and the patient story

926
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:16,239
that we did this guy was a uh in a VA

927
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:19,759
Hospital military completely against

928
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:22,279
cannabis his kids snuck in non-active 50

929
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:24,680
migr 3 to1 this is a leukemia patient

930
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:27,400
Yep this recent one and and activated

931
00:36:24,679 --> 00:36:30,000
one to one and you know snuck that into

932
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:32,400
the Hospital 3 weeks later I I was

933
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,400
explaining went into remission I didn't

934
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,920
really want to film The Story So I

935
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:39,599
waited from November until last week to

936
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:41,440
film it just to make sure because you

937
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:44,920
know when somebody walks in extremely

938
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:47,119
ecstatic and happy and and like it's

939
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:49,358
shocking for us as well and so we want

940
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:51,920
to make sure that we have the that right

941
00:36:49,358 --> 00:36:53,480
the right information um this this has

942
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,838
happened many many times hundreds of

943
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:58,358
times but you can't ignore this and so

944
00:36:56,838 --> 00:37:00,719
what happens is you have to figure out

945
00:36:58,358 --> 00:37:04,679
how how do you create how do you create

946
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:06,959
a use for that and so suspending it into

947
00:37:04,679 --> 00:37:09,440
uh infusing it and suspending into fatty

948
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:12,079
acids and lipids allows for

949
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:16,240
bioavailability increased to 300 and

950
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:18,880
400% utilizing can cannabis tpin whether

951
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:20,838
you're using them in in in your rosin or

952
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:23,559
your hash or extracts and you're smoking

953
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:26,719
them or digesting them or using them in

954
00:37:23,559 --> 00:37:28,838
sublinguals increases bioavailability

955
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:30,519
just like it does and oranges and every

956
00:37:28,838 --> 00:37:33,920
kind of fruit vegetable and things that

957
00:37:30,519 --> 00:37:36,400
we put into our body and so I feel like

958
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:39,440
the wave the next wave in the future of

959
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:43,599
of real medicine especially here is you

960
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:46,240
know figuring out how to uh you know

961
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:48,640
educate the the public first on that so

962
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:51,239
you've got breeders and you have farmers

963
00:37:48,639 --> 00:37:54,960
and you know the wave of just breeding

964
00:37:51,239 --> 00:37:57,598
CBD genetics it's kind of like ready for

965
00:37:54,960 --> 00:38:00,760
the next chapter we need to breed CBD

966
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:03,960
genetics drug cultivars that Express

967
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:06,200
specific profiles of tpin so that we can

968
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:08,079
maximize the bioavailability in the

969
00:38:06,199 --> 00:38:10,719
medicine that we're making so if the

970
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:13,680
government decides to restrict you to 30

971
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:15,959
Mig per capsule then you say man if I

972
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:18,960
was just eating a 30 milligram edible

973
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:21,079
chocolate bar I've lost 95% of that

974
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:23,358
medicine but if I'm eating a 30

975
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:25,680
milligram capsule uh like what we're

976
00:38:23,358 --> 00:38:28,119
creating then you're getting an increase

977
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:32,078
in that bioavailability so we only use

978
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:34,358
10 20 mgram capsules and 50 MGR capsules

979
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:38,079
is our Max I personally don't eat the 50

980
00:38:34,358 --> 00:38:42,960
MGR active capsules um because it feels

981
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:46,000
like 350 MGR and I don't do well with

982
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:48,720
Edibles so that's why I was very keen on

983
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,159
micro doing and after talking to our

984
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:52,399
scientists and different doctors when

985
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:55,358
you look at sublinguals and you say okay

986
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:57,480
I can give you 400 dosages in the power

987
00:38:55,358 --> 00:39:00,480
of your fingertips at 1 milligram

988
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:03,199
dosages you look at canabo uh Pharma

989
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:04,679
kinetics that's done uh overseas in

990
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:06,519
Europe you realize that when somebody

991
00:39:04,679 --> 00:39:08,399
eats it or somebody smokes it or they

992
00:39:06,519 --> 00:39:10,759
use a sublingual you can see the

993
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:13,440
bioavailabilities but you could also see

994
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:16,760
how well it absorbs so Crossing into the

995
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:18,559
glandular underneath your tongue doctors

996
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:20,440
can subscribe to that they understand

997
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:23,400
that they're like okay I'm giving 1

998
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:26,079
milligram dosing I'm ad administering it

999
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:28,880
as a sublingual and I can work this way

1000
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:31,318
up a new can a new cannabis patient

1001
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:33,200
instead of jumping into a 500 mgram

1002
00:39:31,318 --> 00:39:35,239
magical brownie that's going to take him

1003
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:37,519
onto a trip for two days and probably

1004
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:41,559
they'll never use cannabis again we

1005
00:39:37,519 --> 00:39:44,280
start with one milligram with one unit

1006
00:39:41,559 --> 00:39:45,880
so if somebody says I have pain and you

1007
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:48,240
that's all you have you just have pain

1008
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:50,000
you have neurop neuropathy or pain you

1009
00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:52,719
don't have trouble sleeping no you don't

1010
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,400
have IBS no you don't have tumors no you

1011
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:57,959
just have pain well that tells us

1012
00:39:54,400 --> 00:40:00,240
category one thca if you're brand new to

1013
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:02,280
cannabis and you're sensitive we go raw

1014
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:04,479
and so by susp suspending this into

1015
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:06,519
plant fat we're able to get the raw

1016
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,679
cannaboids into the body just like with

1017
00:40:06,519 --> 00:40:10,599
the juicing that you were talking about

1018
00:40:08,679 --> 00:40:12,960
and building up a proper saturation if

1019
00:40:10,599 --> 00:40:14,800
someone needs a massive dose it's best

1020
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:18,000
to build up to that to give someone a

1021
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:19,240
gram of resin in one shot that's

1022
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,838
especially if you're eating it there's

1023
00:40:19,239 --> 00:40:22,879
something that happens in the liver when

1024
00:40:20,838 --> 00:40:24,559
we consume cannabis it goes into our

1025
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:27,400
stomach and then it metabolizes in our

1026
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:29,759
liver and THC in particular metabolizes

1027
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:32,920
is into a metabolite called 11 hydroxy

1028
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:35,119
metabolite and it is extremely powerful

1029
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:36,680
for anyone that thinks they've graduated

1030
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:38,559
from Edibles because they've smoked a

1031
00:40:36,679 --> 00:40:40,519
joint they quickly learned that they did

1032
00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:42,639
not graduate from Edibles once they ate

1033
00:40:40,519 --> 00:40:44,079
that Brownie and they were like wow this

1034
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:45,078
is a real serious thing so that's

1035
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:47,200
another thing that could be very

1036
00:40:45,079 --> 00:40:48,640
uncomfortable for patients and it's why

1037
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:50,598
it's one of the things I'm really stoked

1038
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:54,279
about the The Prana and the act now is

1039
00:40:50,599 --> 00:40:56,800
that it's this this micro doing 1 mgram

1040
00:40:54,280 --> 00:41:00,920
drops under the tongue you know how much

1041
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:04,318
that is most Edibles are 35 or 50 or 100

1042
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:07,159
m milligram some are 250 some are 500

1043
00:41:04,318 --> 00:41:09,599
I've seen 1,000 mgram medibles those

1044
00:41:07,159 --> 00:41:12,078
will knock you out those are not really

1045
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:14,760
what I would give to Grandma yeah and

1046
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:16,160
they're just uh it's taxing on the body

1047
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:18,599
you know so these are these are things

1048
00:41:16,159 --> 00:41:20,279
that we're coming and AD and you're

1049
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:22,880
advancing and

1050
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:24,680
so the the possibilities are really

1051
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,960
unlimited in the sense of how you can

1052
00:41:24,679 --> 00:41:30,159
combine things so there's other studies

1053
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:33,199
out are combining black tea with fatty

1054
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:35,960
acids lipids cannabinoids tpin that

1055
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:38,118
increases bioavailability so just think

1056
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:41,519
about like how superfoods or if you look

1057
00:41:38,119 --> 00:41:46,200
at alkaline chart of foods and you say

1058
00:41:41,519 --> 00:41:48,280
Okay kale Himalayan uh salt um cayenne

1059
00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:50,480
pepper all of these things that are

1060
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:52,160
considered superfoods are very high on

1061
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:54,318
the alkaline and things that are

1062
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:56,559
generally bad for us are very low and

1063
00:41:54,318 --> 00:41:58,358
acidic and so when you're dealing with

1064
00:41:56,559 --> 00:41:59,799
cancer and things like that we want to

1065
00:41:58,358 --> 00:42:01,719
lots of theories say cancer can't

1066
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:03,760
survive in a high alkaline diet and all

1067
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:06,318
of all of the uh all of the patients

1068
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:09,119
that we we work with as well as myself

1069
00:42:06,318 --> 00:42:11,358
as I try to recommend that is say okay

1070
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:14,000
let's strengthen our body and our and

1071
00:42:11,358 --> 00:42:15,598
our mind and our health to be as as good

1072
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,880
as it can and you look at foods and it

1073
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:19,880
works the same way and so when we when

1074
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:22,079
we look at the future of that it's

1075
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:25,079
saying okay we've got this wide spectrum

1076
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:27,200
of tpin we've got this organic resin

1077
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:29,519
we've got these uh categories and

1078
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:31,439
putting them into suspended fats and

1079
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:33,239
delivery methods and then the next

1080
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:35,519
chapter to that is how do we incorporate

1081
00:42:33,239 --> 00:42:37,279
into the mainstream into other medicinal

1082
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:39,920
Foods cuz that's really what

1083
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:41,880
cannabinoids are they're medicinal Foods

1084
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:43,400
yeah they're they're actually essential

1085
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:45,440
they are essential if you understand

1086
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:47,920
that essential amino acids are the

1087
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:49,318
building blocks of endoc canabo the can

1088
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:51,880
the cannabinoids that we produce

1089
00:42:49,318 --> 00:42:54,400
endogenously in our body that is why

1090
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:57,800
they're called essential amino acids

1091
00:42:54,400 --> 00:43:00,318
because we need endoc canabo to survive

1092
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:02,440
it regulates our endoc canab cannabinoid

1093
00:43:00,318 --> 00:43:04,639
system and in turn that system regulates

1094
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:06,280
both our immune system and our central

1095
00:43:04,639 --> 00:43:08,838
nervous system it puts them into

1096
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:10,920
homeostasis and so it's it's it's a very

1097
00:43:08,838 --> 00:43:12,358
important thing for people to learn I we

1098
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:15,159
don't have much more time to talk I

1099
00:43:12,358 --> 00:43:16,880
really wanted to end it on um letting

1100
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:18,318
you guys know to not be afraid to share

1101
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,838
this information with anyone that you

1102
00:43:18,318 --> 00:43:21,558
know whether it's for a preventative

1103
00:43:19,838 --> 00:43:23,400
aspect a recreational someone that's

1104
00:43:21,559 --> 00:43:25,319
stressed out and needs to relax someone

1105
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:27,200
that needs it for medicinal purposes

1106
00:43:25,318 --> 00:43:29,358
Don't Be Afraid like doctors are to to

1107
00:43:27,199 --> 00:43:32,318
share this information because it it's

1108
00:43:29,358 --> 00:43:35,318
the right thing to do and uh there's

1109
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:37,239
nothing more important to a terminal

1110
00:43:35,318 --> 00:43:39,960
patient Than Hope and if you can give

1111
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:42,439
hope to a terminal patient you've done a

1112
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:45,119
great job thanks everyone for listening

1113
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:46,639
I really appreciate it you make some

1114
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:47,800
questions yeah we could hit maybe a few

1115
00:43:46,639 --> 00:43:49,838
questions but I want to make sure we

1116
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:52,000
leave the time it's 350 you want a 10

1117
00:43:49,838 --> 00:43:55,639
minutes two questions we'll take so if

1118
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:58,318
you want to brain trauma brain trauma

1119
00:43:55,639 --> 00:43:59,558
okay so that's a good one real quick so

1120
00:43:58,318 --> 00:44:03,199
difference between

1121
00:43:59,559 --> 00:44:06,839
CBD yeah so we created one called P5 so

1122
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:11,279
that's all uh that's activated CBD with

1123
00:44:06,838 --> 00:44:14,119
ACDC tpin and so that tpine profile

1124
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:17,440
modulating CBD and so that's when people

1125
00:44:14,119 --> 00:44:20,119
think of CBD think of anti-inflammatory

1126
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:22,720
think of uh improving cognitive function

1127
00:44:20,119 --> 00:44:24,800
it's really good for brain trauma if you

1128
00:44:22,719 --> 00:44:28,639
wanted to pair that in a non-active you

1129
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:30,720
would do like a 3:1 CBD to thca that'll

1130
00:44:28,639 --> 00:44:33,679
be the best for repairing cognitive

1131
00:44:30,719 --> 00:44:33,679
function and postbrain

1132
00:44:34,119 --> 00:44:41,599
Trauma so sleep problems that's our P4

1133
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:44,559
so in large dosages we use CBD and CBN

1134
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:46,920
so that combination of CBD and CBN is

1135
00:44:44,559 --> 00:44:49,720
really good for inducing sleep why

1136
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:52,400
because when THC is degreg into CBN that

1137
00:44:49,719 --> 00:44:54,439
breaks down into a byproduct like Marcus

1138
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:56,519
was talking about that's the ocular

1139
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:58,838
feeling if some of you that are as old

1140
00:44:56,519 --> 00:45:01,639
as I am have ever smoked what was called

1141
00:44:58,838 --> 00:45:04,199
regs orag maybe the worst you ever had

1142
00:45:01,639 --> 00:45:06,838
in Canada was BC bud but in the United

1143
00:45:04,199 --> 00:45:09,639
States we had Mexican swag and that

1144
00:45:06,838 --> 00:45:11,799
stuff made my eyes go like this and it

1145
00:45:09,639 --> 00:45:15,199
and it put me into couch lock that's the

1146
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:18,119
AL that is THC converting into CBN in a

1147
00:45:15,199 --> 00:45:20,118
longterm process on the plant after it's

1148
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:22,079
dead and when you smoke it it's very

1149
00:45:20,119 --> 00:45:23,920
like sedative so what you could do for

1150
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:25,200
yourself like if you weren't able to buy

1151
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:27,119
these products is you could take a

1152
00:45:25,199 --> 00:45:29,519
coconut oil you could crock poot it you

1153
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:30,599
could take a a high a heavy indicia

1154
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:33,159
something that people are like oh this

1155
00:45:30,599 --> 00:45:34,559
is really like heavy you could make a a

1156
00:45:33,159 --> 00:45:36,399
nice extract with it and eat a

1157
00:45:34,559 --> 00:45:38,040
tablespoon or less right before bed and

1158
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,800
you'd sleep like an absolute baby you

1159
00:45:38,039 --> 00:45:42,119
don't actually have to smoke it and

1160
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:44,240
mostly for preventative and and the the

1161
00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:46,400
consumption of cannaboids orally to me

1162
00:45:44,239 --> 00:45:47,879
is one of the most important ways we can

1163
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,920
take them in now if you have ocular

1164
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:51,760
pressure nothing's going to beat smoking

1165
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:54,200
one puff of a joint to reduce ocular

1166
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:55,839
pressure instantly and that can avoid

1167
00:45:54,199 --> 00:45:58,039
blindness so I would never say to the

1168
00:45:55,838 --> 00:45:59,838
people that say we're never going to be

1169
00:45:58,039 --> 00:46:01,960
we're going to move away from uh the

1170
00:45:59,838 --> 00:46:03,358
medical aspect with smoke it's never

1171
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:05,760
going to happen there's always going to

1172
00:46:03,358 --> 00:46:07,838
be people with Ms Parkinson's uh

1173
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:09,880
glaucoma that can re relieve ocular

1174
00:46:07,838 --> 00:46:12,400
pressure and relieve uh Tremors

1175
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:14,920
instantly after one or two Puffs so and

1176
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:18,599
and a real quick tip so those that smoke

1177
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:20,400
bongs you if you collected your reclaim

1178
00:46:18,599 --> 00:46:22,480
or you were able to get keth or you were

1179
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:25,318
able to get your cooking hash if you

1180
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:27,719
just threw it in an oven

1181
00:46:25,318 --> 00:46:32,639
250° and you did it for for a long

1182
00:46:27,719 --> 00:46:34,199
period of time like 9 days long periods

1183
00:46:32,639 --> 00:46:36,480
of time you never hear me say this on

1184
00:46:34,199 --> 00:46:38,159
hash church or anywhere but you can take

1185
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:41,358
your ke and you can convert convert it

1186
00:46:38,159 --> 00:46:45,318
to CBN and so uh I've done full

1187
00:46:41,358 --> 00:46:48,558
conversions of ke into CBN with like 250

1188
00:46:45,318 --> 00:46:51,000
to 270° if you did it quickly like and

1189
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:52,760
you were trying to cook it on a pan on

1190
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,719
the stove it would go from being light

1191
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:57,079
light brown then it would go to CH like

1192
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:58,519
a chocolate coffee ground kind of color

1193
00:46:57,079 --> 00:47:00,240
and it would get really dark you could

1194
00:46:58,519 --> 00:47:02,920
do that with a coconut oil now you have

1195
00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:05,558
CBN and then if you went and got

1196
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:07,240
CBD right if you could get access to CBD

1197
00:47:05,559 --> 00:47:10,000
then you can combine the two and that

1198
00:47:07,239 --> 00:47:12,239
would be really good for using that for

1199
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,480
