second grade is a little bit more grainy

65
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:39,479

had lost that were from this batch in

74
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:01,479
particular that we ground up there's

75
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:03,359

yeah it's uh it's not your standard Kush

82
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,120
smell I would say it was more like a a

83
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,158
Froot Loop smell there's something else

84
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,840

85
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:32,719

from Al or something it was okay so this

88
00:03:35,158 --> 00:03:41,519
is like a a sweet skunk or a Congo maybe

89
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:44,560
maybe excellent Al The Alchemist called

90
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:47,599
it with my eyes that smells great too

91
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:50,199

00:03:55,878 --> 00:04:00,719
exotic in that but

97
00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:03,719

98
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:06,400

118
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:46,038
one of these days yeah I don't

119
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:48,879
understand those I saw those the other

120
00:04:46,038 --> 00:04:51,199
day and it said a 220 a 73 and a 45 and

121
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:55,279
I was like so guaranteed nothing melts

122
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:57,478
with a bul bag guaranteed kit not that

123
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:59,879
kit it was on the wall and I was like a

124
00:04:57,478 --> 00:05:01,279
three bag kit what the I know people ask

125
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:03,000
me all the time do you sell a three bag

126
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:04,799
kit and it's like we had them on the

127
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,680
website for a while and it was just like

128
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,240
slowly but surely it was like I don't

129
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,600
want to have those anymore like I have a

130
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,879
hard enough time selling a four bag kit

131
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,160
which will at least ensure a better

132
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:16,199
quality with that 160 bag in there but

133

locked on this deck other than the walks

153

yeah see everybody's got little

328
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:43,199
different methods you know what for me

329
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:45,240
uh I like things at the level where I

330
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:48,599
can work on so i' say another good thing

331
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:50,120
too sort of interrupt is to um repl like

332
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:52,120
I don't have them in the biggest pots

333
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:54,240
right now yes but I'll replace those

334
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,799
pots with a slightly bigger pot not a

335
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,039
way bigger one but just a slightly

336
00:13:55,799 --> 00:14:00,919
bigger one and I'll do that for the next

337
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:02,519
like you know every 60 days and just

338
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:04,879
increase that pot size it allows the

339
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:06,879
roots to Unbound and just to kind of

340
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:09,240
grow out a little bit and it keeps them

341
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:11,399
from I don't know over a long period of

342
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:13,639
time they seem to get real tight and

343
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:15,440
then they can lock themselves and gray

344
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:17,959
out and yeah then they kind of start

345
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,959
they stop they start dying off parts of

346
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:21,958
the roots and just doesn't seem to be as

347
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:23,439
healthy as if you can just I mean I know

348
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:24,919
eventually that idea is not going to

349
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,519
last forever you know you're going to

350
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:28,838
end up with a 55 gallon uh a lot of

351
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,919
people talking about the air rooting

352
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:31,519
right

353
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:33,198
they get into air rooting so there's all

354
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:36,759
different methods air layers you mean

355
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:38,439
for the air with those geopots where the

356
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:39,759
the roots hit the outside of the pot and

357
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,399
they hit the air and they re back and

358
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:43,680
they come back in So continuously

359
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:45,879
growing in amongst one another and so

360
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:47,519
with the pots they go down we seem to

361
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:49,519
circle or go against the edges that we

362
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:52,480
know it's when we transplant even when I

363
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:54,120
transplant moms after like 3 years same

364
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,759
thing it's just like this well CU you

365
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:59,240
imagine being in that one pot for 3

366
00:14:56,759 --> 00:15:03,000
years I kept one in the same pot for

367
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:04,839
about 5 years yeah yeah I'm I'm saying

368
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,399
give them a little bit of space I'm

369
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:10,959
going to learn uh maybe how to work on

370
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:12,799
root balls in the near future I made a

371
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:14,919
mishap of uh doing a little bit of some

372
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:17,240
work to one of my main moms of medy kush

373
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:19,399
and ripped it out of the soil it almost

374
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:21,278
made me cry oh no so I cut clones from

375
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:22,519
it that was a couple years ago and uh

376
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:25,159
you know it's just

377
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:26,799
like it's like oh you you keep that

378
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:28,519
thing alive for so long and then you

379
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:31,078
make one stupid mistake you know it's

380
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:32,759
dead but uh I was able to you know take

381
00:15:31,078 --> 00:15:34,799
clones from it so it was like third from

382
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:39,639
SE type deal and hi hippo's equivalent

383
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:42,359
is um the smashed B yeah not just bom

384
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:45,039
yeah on the way to the like like I only

385
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:48,440
I only blow four of these a year head

386
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:52,759
piece yeah like that

387
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:55,440
one yeah you move on we call it life

388
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:58,680
it's uh you can't control what happens

389
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:03,199
to you in life but you can control how

390
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:05,039
you react to it to an extent I'm going

391
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:06,958
to say you can control your canabo

392
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:09,559
intake yes i' say we should be

393
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:11,119
controlling that right now um You just

394
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:13,799
loaded me up with a bowl so why don't I

395
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:16,240
load you up with a bowl some of my Astro

396
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:16,240
Boy Fresh

397
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:25,679
Frozen just running my full plants right

398
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:31,198
into the bags and turned it into this

399
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:33,039
hash nice yeah no trimming no needed no

400
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:34,758
it's really great I'm uh I'm the next

401
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:36,879
generation of

402
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:38,959
grower I'm the grower that doesn't

403
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:40,958
consider ever selling my herb so it

404
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:43,958
never has a monetary value to me like

405
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:45,679
that the only real monetary value it has

406
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:48,198
is that I could compare it to how much

407
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:50,559
it would cost if such a thing existed on

408
00:16:48,198 --> 00:16:53,838
the open market which it doesn't I can't

409
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:56,638
go buy fresh frozen 90 Micron Astro Boy

410
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:58,920
nor can I go buy 99% pure dve just don't

411
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,198
find it anywhere I have to do it myself

412
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:02,000
so you have to learn how to do it

413
00:17:00,198 --> 00:17:04,318
yourself too you want to try this one

414
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,000
hippo yeah do you have to I almost feel

415
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:10,318
like yeah this is

416
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:13,599
so load that up or he can load that

417
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:15,279
up it's tasty so yeah what we're talking

418
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:17,119
about is yeah that's the problem is

419
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:20,279
these products are just not accessed

420
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:21,918
because uh they're not offered because

421
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:23,558
they're looking at the amount of Bud and

422
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:25,079
how much money they get for it so you

423
00:17:23,558 --> 00:17:26,879
got to learn how to do this and that's

424
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:30,200
that's the best part about these shows

425
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:32,440
yeah educate people cuuc around it's not

426
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:34,640
you have to make it yourself yeah and

427
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:36,038
not only that it's like cuz people tell

428
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,880
say this all the time I'm not sure what

429
00:17:36,038 --> 00:17:40,240
I need you know how I can access that I

430
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:41,880
don't live in a PL it's like basically

431
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,919
Now's the Time for people to stand up

432
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,600
for their rights to be able to grow this

433
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:47,320
medicine whether they're using it

434
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:50,079
medically recreationally whether they're

435
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:51,200
using it as a preventative a Curative

436
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:53,359
whatever they're using it for they

437
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,159
should have the rights to use it and you

438
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:59,798
the only way to really access this

439
00:17:55,159 --> 00:18:02,000
quality is to a grow your own res and

440
00:17:59,798 --> 00:18:04,279
then B extract

441
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,839
it you know and then eventually when you

442
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:09,200
do that if you don't yet understand the

443
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:11,798
world of hippo and his you know

444
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,558
beautiful glass pieces that he makes

445
00:18:11,798 --> 00:18:15,839
that's really in my opinion where that

446
00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:17,359
connection is understood where you start

447
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:19,639
understanding the time that it takes to

448
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:22,079
grow these plants and the effort and the

449
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:24,038
love and then to extract the resin off

450
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:26,399
and how you get this beautiful end

451
00:18:24,038 --> 00:18:28,279
product that how could you smoke it

452
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,960
through anything else other than a

453
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:33,798
beautiful hand blown glass pipe blown by

454
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:37,600
someone like hippo who loves their art

455
00:18:33,798 --> 00:18:38,639
form and is truly like coming from a

456
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:42,879
heady

457
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:45,120

473
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:21,400
what my hash looked like years ago now

474
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:24,798
it's uh only a year John huh it was only

475

a year no but years ago I never did this

476
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:29,319
no no but even a year ago your bubble

477
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:31,599
and dry sift

478
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:34,319
compared to today is night and day night

479
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:37,879
and day like dude today your hash is as

480
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:40,439
good as hash can be and then last year

481
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:42,600
it was not it was more like this believe

482
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:45,000
it or not when you first brought your

483
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:47,199
dry sift over like look at this you

484
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,319
can't now you look at this and go no way

485
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:53,038
I can't believe there's no way I that

486
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:55,359
was I would boun the crush it all down

487
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:57,119
and been like here I got this epic hash

488
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:59,879
and and you're like however I'll give

489
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:03,558
you this yours was more gold in color oh

490
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:05,640
that's but it was still the same 80%

491
00:20:03,558 --> 00:20:07,158
contaminant which you know and that's

492
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,759
the first video John and I ever did

493
00:20:07,159 --> 00:20:10,799
together if you if you go back in my

494
00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:12,400
channel and you find the video of the

495
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:14,079
dry sifting it's in the dry sift

496
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,400
playlist and it's got the picture of the

497
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:18,558
few gland heads as the main front

498
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:21,480
picture it's about a minute long it's

499
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:25,240
just us taking a rip of dry sift that's

500
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:27,640
John's dry sift that I cleaned for 45

501
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:29,720
minutes and that was

502
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:32,159
fire

503
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:34,600
ego and the funny thing was is after we

504
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:35,960
did the rip we knocked the card and

505
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:37,798
Spilled the rest and we laughed our

506
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:42,880
heads off cuz we were so

507
00:20:37,798 --> 00:20:45,720
St yeah that was my fault it was um it

508
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:47,240
was an epic change for me I realized

509
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,759
something that I never really knew you

510
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:50,839
got to talk loud with that in the

511
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:53,279
background so I learned something I

512
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:55,639
thought I never learned was actually how

513
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:57,440
to actually truly get the medical

514
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:00,159
effects from my medicine and that's one

515
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:02,558
thing I've been talking about s is is

516
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:05,120
really it's puf them it's purifying them

517
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:06,599
and that's why I'm able to actually lead

518
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:08,959
a better quality of life every day and

519
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:10,759
I'm not smoking big heavy joints all the

520
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,319
time now and stuff like that it's it's

521
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:15,359
so much easier to medicate and at the

522
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:17,200
same time it's um it's more stealthy I

523
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:20,719
got my Trippy Stick I can do a ring this

524
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:23,880
just it's great I love the Trippy

525
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:26,200
Stick It would never replace this oh and

526
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:29,200
for me now it's all about glass it's

527
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:31,319
about I grow organically um I want to

528
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,278
use something organ I want to use a Ste

529
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:34,798
or whatever you know what I mean like I

530
00:21:33,278 --> 00:21:36,480
used to always roll my joints now I'm

531
00:21:34,798 --> 00:21:38,679
always hitting a nice glass bong and

532
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:41,120
really enjoying when

533
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:43,000
I'm that's why I can't you know this

534
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:46,719
this nail I can only hit on a pipe like

535
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,880
this that's a little py like if I'm home

536
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,159
I want

537
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:52,120
quartz it seems to defeat the purpose to

538
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:54,278
have such a nice glass

539
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:57,439
pipe with a

540
00:21:54,278 --> 00:21:59,960
metal nail on it if if you don't have to

541
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,840
I do have a little pipe like this and I

542
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:04,440
have the same nail on

543
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:07,119
it there's no I mean it would be nice to

544
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:11,038
have a little mini quartz I guess or

545
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:12,839
ceramic haven't really seen uh seen one

546
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:16,720
like that yet though Hive has the

547
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:19,240
ceramic one but not in the 10 or eight I

548
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:22,159
think theirs is like 14 and

549
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:23,558
18 give it six months yeah give it six

550
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:25,600
months if

551
00:22:23,558 --> 00:22:28,918
that it won't take long well there's a

552
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:30,719
lot of different varieties in ceramic so

553
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:32,840
I don't know too too much about it but

554
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,200
Brian Schroeder from Dil has given me a

555
00:22:32,839 --> 00:22:37,399
little bit of a lesson here and there

556
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:39,480
and he was just saying the price on true

557
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:42,600
the ceramic that you would want is just

558
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:44,720
so outrageous for just a single nail

559
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:48,359
that it's seemingly not feasible for

560
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:50,679
from dils point of view you know whereas

561
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:53,038
Mike from Dementia or from hive I should

562
00:22:50,679 --> 00:22:54,798
say uh I I don't know what he has to say

563
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:56,359
about that yet but I'll have to ask him

564
00:22:54,798 --> 00:22:59,158
about what what he thinks you know the

565
00:22:56,359 --> 00:23:01,359
differences in the price range in the

566
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:03,720
quality it's a it's a difficult one when

567
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:06,319
you're inhaling off something that's why

568
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:08,079
I feel good about the quartz you know

569
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:11,599
the first time I hit quartz has to be

570
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:14,199
like almost 15 years ago when I hit the

571
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:17,480
volatier the volatier was a vaporizer

572
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:18,720
that was a wand and it had a quartz bowl

573
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:20,159
and I remember the first thing that I

574
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,720
noticed that was different about it was

575
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:25,120
the way the oils recondensed in the stem

576
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:28,120
of this bowl cuz I also had a VP Tech

577
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:29,759
gun at the same time and that glass one

578
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:32,719
which was basically doing the same thing

579
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:35,919
except with Forest air it was producing

580
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:39,319
red oil in the stem the

581
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:42,000
volatier was producing clear oil in the

582
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:45,558
stem and the way the the what I figured

583
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:48,240
that was was because the glass one the

584
00:23:45,558 --> 00:23:52,158
stem got warmer heated those oils and

585
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:54,599
turned them that CBN red color the

586
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:56,480
quartz the way it dissipates heat is

587
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:58,240
unbelievable so if you heat up the top

588
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:01,038
of the quartz Bowl even this quartz Bowl

589
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:03,919
right here isn't hot right here and it

590
00:24:01,038 --> 00:24:05,200
only starts to get hot I mean it's warm

591
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:07,278
right here but I mean that's

592
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,480
unbelievable man if this was titanium my

593
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:11,200
fingers would be sizzled oh you would be

594
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:13,360
you know what I mean the it's just not

595
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,120
cold down here and I like that about the

596
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:18,038
quartz that I can lift it up off the

597
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:21,399
pipe you know I can I can basically deal

598
00:24:18,038 --> 00:24:23,960
with it while it's still Wicked hot you

599
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:27,240
cannot do that with a

600
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:29,399
titanium so yeah that was just my ramble

601
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,960
you know clearly baked we're enjoying

602
00:24:29,398 --> 00:24:32,839
ourselves on this beautiful day well

603
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,440
well medicated I'm not sure what the

604
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:36,319
sound in the background is I I was

605
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,960
thinking that it could be a boat down I

606
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:40,558
thought it was a

607
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:43,720
plane but now it seems more like a leaf

608
00:24:40,558 --> 00:24:45,480
blower it could be a leaf blower anyway

609
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:47,519
we're not hung up on the sound if if you

610
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:49,919
guys aren't we're going to go and chill

611
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:52,240
for a little bit off camera but uh hope

612
