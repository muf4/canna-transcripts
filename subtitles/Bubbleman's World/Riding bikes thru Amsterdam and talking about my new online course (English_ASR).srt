1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:07,890
going on YouTube bubbleman here just one

2
00:00:05,129 --> 00:00:12,089
of my last days in Amsterdam and I

3
00:00:07,889 --> 00:00:14,580
thought I would go live yes I am live

4
00:00:12,089 --> 00:00:16,920
look at that just riding my bike through

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:21,300
Amsterdam here having a very nice time

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:24,480
it's a beautiful beautiful day and just

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,618
on my way to go see a friend figured I

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,868
would tell you guys a little bit about

9
00:00:25,618 --> 00:00:29,609
my new online course for those of you

10
00:00:27,868 --> 00:00:32,308
that haven't seen I'm doing a solvent

11
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:36,059
las' extraction course in conjunction

12
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:41,250
with ganja talks the free four-part

13
00:00:36,058 --> 00:00:42,839
series is already up actually and we're

14
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:46,200
gonna be doing a more in-depth version

15
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,940
of the course here soon where we are

16
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:52,260
it's going to be an actual pay course

17
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:57,628
and so oh no - the next one the new

18
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:59,789
market alright following my friend right

19
00:00:57,628 --> 00:01:01,259
now is a little bit chaotic as I'm

20
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:03,570
driving a bike to your Amsterdam and

21
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:05,009
there's cars and people everywhere can

22
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:08,909
you talk about the misconception of

23
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:11,219
cannabis psychosis well um that's a

24
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:17,969
difficult one you know I used to have a

25
00:01:11,219 --> 00:01:19,950
roommate who you know truly was probably

26
00:01:17,969 --> 00:01:22,250
cannabis wasn't for him and I think it

27
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:24,659
really opened a little bit of that

28
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:27,000
misconception up in him I had never seen

29
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:28,320
it before but I think cannabis is an

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,609
amazing substance but you have to

31
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:31,849
understand there's so many people in the

32
00:01:29,609 --> 00:01:36,900
world but there's always gonna be

33
00:01:31,849 --> 00:01:40,649
someone who it affects in a way that is

34
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:44,280
not so positive quick little change of

35
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:46,618
hands are kind of sketchy I got 20

36
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,909
people watching live but really what I

37
00:01:46,618 --> 00:01:52,170
want to talk to you today is the course

38
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:53,880
so my bio on Instagram has to go to go

39
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:56,549
follow me on instagram at bc bubbleman

40
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:59,519
in my bio there's a link into the

41
00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:01,920
cannabis ganja talks University your

42
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:06,319
ganja tux solvent list extraction course

43
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:09,770
and basically the first four videos were

44
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:11,840
oh the next chat past church I'm hoping

45
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:14,570
on Sunday but the first four videos that

46
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,240
I did were basically free I did four

47
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:20,000
modules I talked about the different

48
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:22,400
types of glandular trichomes I spoke

49
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,900
about water extraction and freezing the

50
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,469
wax membrane and isolating glandular

51
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:30,110
trichomes to a 99.9% purity I spoke

52
00:02:27,469 --> 00:02:31,490
about dry sifting the mechanical screen

53
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:35,030
separation of using different sized

54
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:37,879
screens carding a little bit about the

55
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:40,759
DVD static tech and then I talked about

56
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:42,439
rosin as well and I went in depth to

57
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:45,799
moisture content flour versus hash

58
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:49,729
played speed to temp different units

59
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:51,950
that can be used to process and you know

60
00:02:49,729 --> 00:02:54,169
it was free course so I didn't go as

61
00:02:51,949 --> 00:02:55,549
deep as I could have but the reception

62
00:02:54,169 --> 00:02:57,979
was so good to the course that we

63
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:59,719
decided to do a much more in-depth

64
00:02:57,979 --> 00:03:03,439
course and I guess that's going to take

65
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:05,960
a lot more of my time up so we decided

66
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:07,280
to make a pay course the team I'm

67
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:09,560
working with has been incredibly

68
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,830
professional they put together a really

69
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:14,270
great course and I'm gonna be the

70
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:16,280
professor for that course it's gonna be

71
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:18,469
an online course there's gonna be three

72
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:22,030
modules bubble hash dry sift and rosin

73
00:03:18,469 --> 00:03:24,650
is it clean that's great to hear

74
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:25,849
we are just riding you can see where I

75
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:27,650
am right now that's kind of crazy

76
00:03:25,849 --> 00:03:29,359
because they're seeing everything that's

77
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:33,680
going by but you're not really catching

78
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:35,780
oh good Joel good I hope that I hope

79
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,420
that it's wow look for the price that it

80
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:40,610
is for 249 bucks you're absolutely going

81
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:43,039
to get your money's worth there's going

82
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:45,260
to be a certificate in the end so you'd

83
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:48,139
be certified as the bubble man solvent

84
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:50,449
list extraction courses is completed and

85
00:03:48,139 --> 00:03:52,639
I'm also going to have coupons for some

86
00:03:50,449 --> 00:03:57,469
of the different tools that we'll be

87
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:59,779
using from the bubble bags the bubble

88
00:03:57,469 --> 00:04:02,120
now is the mechanical screens the rosin

89
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:03,860
presses either sasquatch or peer

90
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,240
pressure I don't want to be able to give

91
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:07,070
you guys discounts on some of these

92
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,750
units so when you pick up this

93
00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:11,239
information and you learn it you want to

94
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:14,000
apply it and this will be variable

95
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:15,770
pliable information you'll be able to

96
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,600
start a company based on the information

97
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:20,750
I'm going to share for you for a measly

98
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,189
249 bucks I think it'll be well worth it

99
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:24,740
and well priced

100
00:04:22,189 --> 00:04:28,160
and I'm looking really forward to it so

101
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:31,430
you guys have any questions at all about

102
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:37,430
it or anything else for that matter feel

103
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:41,900

108
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:56,470
ambulance

109
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:59,829
I'd be careful OOP

110
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:59,830

to Amsterdam it's been a long time since

119
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:30,920
I actually spent some time here and it's

120
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:32,389
just a beautiful city you know and it

121
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:35,330
helps obviously when you have friends

122
00:05:32,389 --> 00:05:37,300
and you know the city really well I've

123
00:05:35,329 --> 00:05:40,000
been coming here of course for 23 years

124
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:42,020
so I've gotten to know it pretty well

125
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,060
over the last few years

126
00:05:42,019 --> 00:05:46,099
funny to see such a small group of

127
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:48,290
people that it must be three or four in

128

wonderful journey they're all great

139
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:29,960

140
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:33,259
solid business plan to bring tissue

141
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:35,870
culture to the cannabis industry and a

142

00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,649
have any questions about the course or

166
00:07:56,899 --> 00:08:02,819
anything else that you want to ask me

167
00:08:00,649 --> 00:08:05,219
the course so I'll tell you something if

168
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:08,219
you don't of course I've consumed today

169
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:11,670
are you kidding me the course is going

170
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:14,130
to not only have three modules bubble

171
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:16,430
hash dry sift and rosin but it's going

172
00:08:14,129 --> 00:08:19,949
to have four videos in each module and

173
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:23,100
then it's also going to have a live

174
00:08:19,949 --> 00:08:25,199
demonstration video where I'll be doing

175
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:27,780
the process for the particular

176
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,420
particular module and you'll be able to

177
00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:32,819
watch live and ask questions and have

178
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:34,830
your questions answered I have been to

179
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:36,990
the green house coffee shop took my

180
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:38,540
friend there on day one we didn't

181
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:41,490
actually purchase anything I'm pretty

182
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:46,939
connected here in Amsterdam and don't

183
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:50,850
really purchase from coffee shops but I

184
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:54,540
had to go show them it's a lovely little

185
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:57,180
lovely little shop no unfortunately I'm

186
00:08:54,539 --> 00:09:01,409
not able to share tech that's not my

187
00:08:57,179 --> 00:09:06,870
tech but see if I can break here and

188
00:09:01,409 --> 00:09:09,809
actually stop Oh what do you think of

189
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:11,549
them apples Ian this place is amazing

190
00:09:09,809 --> 00:09:14,759
it's pretty good right I don't want to

191
00:09:11,549 --> 00:09:16,589
leave we're just cruising I thought

192
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:19,819
already way I thought Aurora was already

193
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:23,129
leaving the tissue culture method well I

194
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:24,510
don't think that they're leaving the

195
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:26,490
tissue culture method I think they're

196
00:09:24,509 --> 00:09:29,220
going to be doing it through their new

197
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:30,509
partnership with the nandi labs and one

198
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:33,810
of the things that Andy offers is

199
00:09:30,509 --> 00:09:34,830
cleaning up genetics but Sega is a

200
00:09:33,809 --> 00:09:37,559
little bit different in the sense that

201
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:40,350
they have an incredible multiplication

202
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:43,289
rate and they have a molecular biology

203
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:46,290
lab that's been standardized through the

204
00:09:43,289 --> 00:09:49,199
use of hops a plant that has had tens of

205
00:09:46,289 --> 00:09:52,319
millions of dollars spent on it for the

206
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,330
genome so they're doing things they're

207
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:57,450
really specializing on tissue culture

208
00:09:54,330 --> 00:10:00,170
and not doing a lot of else what's going

209
00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:00,170
on wrong crush

210
00:10:04,429 --> 00:10:14,419

213
00:10:17,629 --> 00:10:22,269

229
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:11,060
