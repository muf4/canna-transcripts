1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,370
hey what's up guys and gals bubbleman

2
00:00:02,609 --> 00:00:07,439
here with flat 421 who just stopped by

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:10,769
and brought some absolutely beautiful

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,719
glass from quarry one of my local glass

5
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:15,480
blowers that blooms just across the

6
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:17,339
water on the Sunshine Coast what

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,929
yeah no flat you want to tell us a

8
00:00:17,339 --> 00:00:21,269
little bit about these bad boys for sure

9
00:00:18,929 --> 00:00:23,489
well this is one of his goddess tubes

10
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:26,879
it's got ready lines and in town most

11
00:00:23,489 --> 00:00:28,348
it's a slime the thing about this is it

12
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:30,000
as a Celtic knot it's kind of hard to

13
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:31,829
see I'll take photos of it and you'll be

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,710
able to show everything that you're

15
00:00:31,829 --> 00:00:36,719
talking about up close yeah he took one

16
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,429
of the Scot Deppe courses and it's one

17
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,558
of the first Celtic knots that he

18
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:44,759
attempted in this chemo really

19
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:47,128
successfully this one is another sort of

20
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:48,839
piece that came out of some of the

21
00:00:47,128 --> 00:00:51,539
classic took from Scotts about a lot of

22
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,730
other inspiration from other artists the

23
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:57,899
staircase eyeballs that experience some

24
00:00:53,729 --> 00:01:00,479
of the work that stacked rainbow all

25
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:05,400
through and the thing about this guy's

26
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:09,390
it's got the perk underneath filled it a

27
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:13,290
brain bird brain perk very cool and the

28
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:15,930
smoke will come down the tube then up

29
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:18,000
through here should I demo it well oh I

30
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:19,880
would say so yes yeah you won't be

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,829
seeing it but he'll explain it so

32
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:24,420
bubbleman is gonna hit it and the smokes

33
00:01:22,829 --> 00:01:27,509
gonna come down through here and down

34
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:30,150
either eye-sockets here through the

35
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:32,069
joint in the under the eye and down

36
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:34,799
behind where the mouthpiece is in the

37
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:37,279
back where you can puff it quite

38
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,280
beautifully

39
00:01:40,109 --> 00:01:44,549
especially if some nice melting good

40
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:44,549
stuff like that

41
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:51,480
a very unique piece you can't see the

42
00:01:50,609 --> 00:01:53,099
bowl at all

43
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:57,930
you know it's almost as though you're

44
00:01:53,099 --> 00:02:00,209
sensing the flame on the hash and how it

45
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:01,920
reliefs we leave smoke into your throat

46
00:02:00,209 --> 00:02:05,669
of it gives you a bit of heat you sorta

47
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,349
I was guiding my hit like that that sits

48
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:10,530
up like this it's true the bowls except

49
00:02:07,349 --> 00:02:13,409
a little above the eye line but real

50
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:17,430
nice small mouthpiece now you got it on

51
00:02:13,409 --> 00:02:19,079
there perfect one of the things I love

52
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:21,239
about the mothership peace left-eye

53
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,310
recently tomograph truth lab is right

54
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:26,849
when I was smoking it I look straight

55
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:29,400
down the bowl a lot of bubble heads left

56
00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:31,019
this is a similar piece you look right

57
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,330
down at the bowl I think the distance

58
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:37,439
that he made this up from the mouthpiece

59
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:41,900
is down there perfect and this this head

60
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:41,900
this would almost make an incredible

61
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:51,299
block see it came here I'll quickly go

62
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:57,750
up camera here but Corey makes most of

63
00:02:51,299 --> 00:03:02,459
his Corey makes most of his pieces for

64
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:06,120
the oil heads and I mean I have nothing

65
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:11,659
no problem so these are the domes that

66
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:11,659
they came with and then he custom did

67
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:16,379
these have two hospitals for leniency

68
00:03:15,299 --> 00:03:18,150
these are awesome

69
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:19,650
you know honestly and not in my opinion

70
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:23,039
does the and the bowl does the bowl come

71
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:25,170
off or yeah no it's it's but even it has

72
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:26,849
when I don't know I like to ask yet know

73
00:03:25,169 --> 00:03:29,849
for sure the bowl come off and

74
00:03:26,849 --> 00:03:32,400
desiccated downstem actually that's nice

75
00:03:29,849 --> 00:03:33,900
I start they're removable and then if

76
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,680
you want something that's maybe a little

77
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,680
more convenient

78
00:03:46,699 --> 00:04:36,930
because well there is something to be

79
00:04:35,069 --> 00:04:39,540
said from puffing out a heavy glass I'll

80
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:41,519
tell you even this piece here that is

81
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:45,420
really a production piece I think he

82
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:47,370
does mildly Neddy's the other way it's

83
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:53,040
pretty much picked up but this is real

84
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:54,899
eddie pz released I mean so I'm going to

85
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,710
show my friends that are watching along

86
00:04:54,899 --> 00:04:57,709

00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,040

[Music]

90
00:05:16,329 --> 00:05:39,938
I would mind hitting it without the

91
00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:51,939
other down stem if I may yeah real fine

92
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:53,740
always a treat smoking glass myself I'm

93
00:05:51,939 --> 00:05:56,288
just a collect heavy glass I haven't

94
00:05:53,740 --> 00:06:04,780
reported a few years but I live

95
00:05:56,288 --> 00:06:06,158
vicariously through these pieces you

96
00:06:04,779 --> 00:06:07,809
have it back in the day exactly if I

97
00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:09,579
wanted to hit those pieces I had to only

98
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:10,990
mean nowadays there's enough people like

99
00:06:09,579 --> 00:06:12,639
yourself collect them I don't

100
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:14,528
necessarily have to own them all it's

101
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,860
nice to know that my friends can all

102
00:06:14,528 --> 00:06:16,860
remember

[Music]

105
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:46,230
because of the three the three hold iffy

106
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:49,949
there really there's a lot of variation

107
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:52,530
you know like if you were to design her

108
00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:54,269
for doing that you'd want the moles a

109
00:06:52,529 --> 00:06:54,929
lot smaller right though there's no

110
00:06:54,269 --> 00:06:59,209
restriction

111
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:59,209
this one actually perfect

112
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:07,540
I'm ignoring the phone I'd rather hit

113
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:10,300
this pipe again some other ships loaded

114
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:14,010
for you as well already really different

115
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:14,009
hit on that one it was really tight you

116
00:07:16,829 --> 00:07:22,389
did this like these works were custom

117
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:24,569
productions they were very similar to

118
00:07:22,389 --> 00:07:24,569

[Music]

120
00:07:45,269 --> 00:08:51,819
yeah Polsky and he'll roll up with some

121
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:57,600
nice pelicans actually if you collect

122
00:08:51,820 --> 00:09:00,030
glass it's true it's pretty nice for you

123
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,070
see the shape although I didn't have a

124
00:09:00,029 --> 00:09:04,350
pretty nice Marcel like number three

125
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:06,600
from 1999 of the head of the three

126
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:09,300
pieces the because that year I have it

127
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:11,159
in a in a felony case and I had it on

128
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:14,419
the bike I was cruising around and I

129
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:17,659
stopped at audience

130
00:09:14,419 --> 00:09:19,949
his apartment above the greenhouse I

131
00:09:17,659 --> 00:09:20,669
remember Howard Marks was there and

132
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:26,430
nothing was there

133
00:09:20,669 --> 00:09:27,839
I'm greater Steve was there and I showed

134
00:09:26,429 --> 00:09:29,879
them the pipe and everyone was excited

135
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:31,590
and we still enjoy that I kind of put it

136
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:33,330
back and I thought I was bidding on my

137
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:36,810
bike and at the last minute I got

138
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:41,370
invited to go with them to I believed

139
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:45,869
when our Ian's rose and I forgot the

140
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:47,639
pipe on the bike because of the damsel

141
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:49,320
no I still have the pipe it never got

142
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:50,669
stolen I came back hours later and was

143
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,320
sitting on the back of the bike right

144
00:09:50,669 --> 00:09:54,360
where I left it that's amazing

145
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:57,240
it was unbelievable especially like

146
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:59,129
something like that oh yeah go back then

147
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,259
the value of that pipe was twenty-five

148
00:09:59,129 --> 00:10:05,340
hundred US dollars and it really seemed

149
00:10:01,259 --> 00:10:10,559
like a lot at the time yeah you know

150
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:13,200
exactly so there it is anyway this is

151
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:14,729
just a preview of a little show that

152
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,500
flab and I are going to be doing soon

153
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:19,110
called baker's dozen

154
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:22,679
and we're gonna be kidding we're gonna

155
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:25,740
be hitting up twelve epically beautiful

156
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:28,969
head pieces plus one make it a baker's

157
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:31,529
guys and hopefully we'll bring you that

158
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:34,190
sooner than later

159
00:10:31,529 --> 00:10:37,139
you'll be happy with the wipes we choose

160
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:38,580
so I guess at this point

161
00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:44,299
Vlad and I are going to hit another Bowl

162
