[Music]

2
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:25,039
hey welcome to Bubble man's world I am

3
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:28,279
over here at the West Coast concentrate

4
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:29,519
uh one of the spots yeah with Brett and

5
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:31,359
Adam and today we're going to do a

6
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:33,558
little review on some West Coast

7
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:36,160
concentrate products uh we were going to

8
00:00:33,558 --> 00:00:38,359
film our melt videos first we we did get

9
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:40,199
one melt video done in uh what was that

10
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:42,519
like an hour yeah close to almost broke

11
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:45,079
the pipe twice y dropped the light bulb

12
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:48,079
on the table for additional light uh

13
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:50,759
let's see we dropped the silicone or the

14
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:53,480
uh the ceramic as well as the sapphire

15
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:55,679
burnt the table um we decided we're

16
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:58,759
going to do the Melt videos

17
00:00:55,679 --> 00:01:00,640
later and we're just going to film The

18
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:04,438
Talking aspect uh we're hitting through

19
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:06,478
a silicon carbide uh nail and uh yeah

20
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:08,559
why don't you uh pull out one of those

21
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:10,118
jars tell us a little bit about the

22
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,680
strain you guys can maybe talk a little

23
00:01:10,118 --> 00:01:13,319
bit about what it's like to wash this

24
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,600
particular strain where the Melt is

25
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:17,239
found definitely and uh then we'll all

26
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:18,519
hit it sure or we'll hit it while you

27
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:20,239
guys are talking yeah so just the one

28
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:23,158
from the top there uh this is the purple

29
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:25,199
candy uh which is a pretty big Staple in

30
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:27,400
our flavor Department anyways we run a

31
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,478
lot of purple candy um it's it's a

32
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,680
pleasure to run honestly uh I've never

33
00:01:29,478 --> 00:01:34,158
really had added until I moved out to BC

34
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,720
a few years ago so for me it's it's it's

35
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,640
something similarly new anyways uh but

36
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:40,679
the 120 um this is one of the first

37
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,519
times where we got a big batch of 120

38
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,399
off of it uh so we were like got to

39
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:47,239
share this uh I personally like the

40
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:49,000
bigger heads um full spec is great 73 is

41
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:50,280
great 90 is great but I don't know I

42
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,239
find the bigger heads just have a bit

43
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,359
more flavor uh they they seem to look a

44
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:55,839
little nicer too on the nail uh in my

45
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:59,640
opinion anyways but this stuff is still

46
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:03,079
pretty glandular um when 120's on smells

47
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:05,079
good flavor is usually where it holds

48
00:02:03,078 --> 00:02:06,158
the best out of all the microns it's

49
00:02:05,078 --> 00:02:08,318
proper for sure it's definitely if

50
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,520
you're doing a full spectrum and the 120

51
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:11,479
has that flavor don't be leaving it out

52
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,640
no for sure and we're still

53
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:15,359
experimenting with different uh bags and

54
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:16,958
what's our favorite and you know just

55
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,560
what what seems to give more what's

56
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,239
cleaner um so yeah it's all it's fun for

57
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,640
us like we we love it it's a it's a

58
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:25,360
dream come true really looks pretty

59
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:27,559
melty there for

60
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,200
sure yeah the purple candy is definitely

61
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,560
something we definitely get to run a lot

62
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:33,959
which is really a blessing it's a it's

63
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,519
it's a great hash strain uh at least

64
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:38,840
from from plants that we're what what is

65
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:40,560
the cultivars uh lineage what is purple

66
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,878
candy uh I've heard so many different

67
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,519
things uh we didn't grow this personally

68
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:46,560
uh this this exact like I don't grow

69
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:48,120
cannabis personally but uh so I I don't

70
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,318
want to you know overstep I've Heard

71
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,719
lots of different things I've heard that

72
00:02:49,318 --> 00:02:53,560
there's purple cushion there I've heard

73
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:55,680
there's um uh candy cushion there I've

74
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,280
heard that there's the the perss are in

75
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,360
there so it really depends on who you

76
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,919
got the cut from basically what we've

77
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,959
heard from from from our friends and

78
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:06,399
from where we've got it from is that

79
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:08,439
it's uh Purple Kush and Candy Kush is

80
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,439
basically what we've heard from the

81
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:12,519
closest source to where it comes from

82
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:14,318
anyway you know from my um oil factory

83
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:16,400
and the taste of this rip that I just

84
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:19,399
did that seems pretty on point

85
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,799
definitely Purple Kush um I wouldn't say

86
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,319
the perss just it doesn't mean it

87
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:25,319
couldn't be in there but I don't

88
00:03:23,318 --> 00:03:26,439
somebody's has the pers in it that's

89
00:03:25,318 --> 00:03:27,839
what they've called it that's a thing

90
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:29,239
it's so hard these days where everyone's

91
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,039
calling things what they're called and

92
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:33,840
it's like un you get the seeds from the

93
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:36,479
guy who created The Strain that's really

94
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,280
the only way to do it and uh yeah I mean

95
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:42,000
I personally uh purple cand is one of my

96
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:47,239
favorites for sure uh from from our ume

97
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,239
our batch of flavors anyways yep

98
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:53,560
definitely get out there that last

99
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,519
little bit of the little scoop it's hard

100
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,280
to get that little glass little food

101
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,920
full well you have to be quick on the on

102
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,280
the uh how you drop it uh into the nail

103
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:03,039
that's for sure here ninja dab that's

104
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,079
you too it's like when people leave a

105
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:09,598
little bit of drink on the can take your

106
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:11,280
friends yeah take your friends right

107
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:13,119
yeah that was really nice flavor I love

108
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,319
the potency of the purple candy it

109
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,399
always looks great it's a joy to

110
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:19,759
photograph uh it's a pleasure whether

111
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:22,000
it's in rosin or bubble has the microns

112
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,919
the full spectrum it's hard for me to

113
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,600
say if I have a favorite of the microns

114
00:04:24,918 --> 00:04:28,478
or the full spectrum I really just like

115
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,320
it all when I grab my jars and I see the

116
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:31,959
name on it I'm usually pretty happy to

117
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:34,120
know that I'm going to be able to get a

118
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:36,239
great dab out of this uh out of this

119
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:40,280
hash

120
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,879
definitely yeah the PC's PC's a good

121
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:44,038
returner we've talked about it

122
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:46,519
before something something we get to

123
00:04:44,038 --> 00:04:48,279
watch all the time that was so quiet it

124
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:49,839
didn't land because it landed on the

125
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:52,439
Q-tip but it seemed like it landed on

126
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:54,519
this even it may have yeah cuz I know it

127
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:56,478
was nice I was expecting it to go it's a

128
00:04:54,519 --> 00:05:00,560
very old jar this is a marble Slinger

129
00:04:56,478 --> 00:05:02,839
classic probably 2002 maybe 2003 little

130
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,639
wiggity nice don't want to be losing

131
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:09,359
that fella so yeah there we go we got

132
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:12,639
one flavor down um purple candy 1 to 120

133
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:16,240
Micron from the West Coast concentrate

134
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:18,240
crew let's move on shall we next I got

135
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,720
it I got this

136
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,160
og73 um it was really one of the first

137
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,479
drains we've come across where we pulled

138
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,759
it right out of the bag and knew

139
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:29,279
instantly there was no way we could see

140
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:30,319
it with the the room and temperature

141
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:32,318
that we had

142
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:35,199
um so we instantly had to freeze it go

143
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:37,280
to micro uh go to micro planting and it

144
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,280
turned out really nice micr planting was

145
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:41,399
always sort of like a a safety net for

146
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:43,159
me you know when people asked me what I

147
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:45,758
liked to do more I was like well they're

148
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:47,600
both in my quiver and seing is what I

149
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:51,560
prefer and microplaning can get me out

150
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:54,360
of a jam when my hash is just Tre

151
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:58,360
greased right out yeah yeah know it

152
00:05:54,360 --> 00:06:00,759
turned out really nice it's gassy um I

153
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:02,800
look forward to running more it for sure

154
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:05,879
yeah we're hoping to get some more and

155
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:09,720
it's a true 73 as well so we've kept the

156
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:12,240
90 in there as well as the 120 um so I

157
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:13,639
don't know I I definitely uh it's it's a

158
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,960
new flavor for us to be running and

159
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:18,519
we're definitely um stoked on just any

160
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:20,478
new flavors really but this one seemed

161
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:22,879
to be a really great hash drain hard to

162
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:25,199

OE I mean my God it's just beautiful

244
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:53,639
somebody in church was telling the

245
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:57,399
story about that the OG the somebody

246
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:59,039
called it the AUG at the the trial oh

247
00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:00,958
yeah yeah yeah exactly the the and then

248
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:02,879
he had

249
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:06,679
the AUG cush or something that was a

250
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:09,720
good one I love stories like that oh

251
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:09,719
yeah this is a good

252
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,159
rip that's what you get if you dip your

253
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:16,039
Dabber in my jar and you break a big

254
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:17,360
chunk of hash off smoke it all you get

255
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:20,159
to smoke

256
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,800
it which is not a bad thing not if you

257
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:24,639
want that I definitely don't mind your

258
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:27,000
that no it's uh it would have been a

259
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:28,399
nice melt video this one cuz it was you

260
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,919
know generally we don't want to waste

261
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,720
hash when we're making a a melt video a

262
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:33,958
lot of people think I waste my hash I'm

263
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:36,360
smoking that hash while I'm making the

264
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:38,159
Melt video it's not an easy thing to do

265
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,879
it's not especially once you do two or

266
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:43,559
three in a row and you know a size hit

267
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:45,159
like that you smoke a gram in 15 minutes

268
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:47,199
and you're destroyed yeah then you got

269
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:49,000
to try and edit it or something and

270
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,839

another to show their subtle differences

285
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:22,240
this seems to be potentially it's a

286
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:25,399
little cheesier funky smelling than the

287

00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:49,720
jar from a photographer standpoint I

325
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:52,439
couldn't tell where he hit it from you

326
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:54,399
tell where I hit it from of course I was

327
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:56,240
like how did he do that I'm just this is

328
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,679
my this is my wake and bake here so I

329
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,639
don't know what's going on really yeah

330
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:01,559
this is a that's all right to not know

331
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:03,799
what's going on even further there you

332
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:05,838
go you've already had two hits haven't

333
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:08,278
you yeah

334
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:10,000
exactly third one more than two hits cuz

335
00:13:08,278 --> 00:13:12,198
we were doing the the trying to get the

336
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,759
Melt hits I know what was happening with

337
00:13:12,198 --> 00:13:15,759
the Melt hits to give you the Side Story

338
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:17,759
is my flash ring that sits on the front

339
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:19,639
of the camera it's broken on the inside

340
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:22,078
it has three clips and one of the clips

341
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:25,278
on the inside no longer pushes out to

342
00:13:22,078 --> 00:13:27,559
hold it on the lens so it falls off and

343
00:13:25,278 --> 00:13:30,000
it falls on top of delicate things like

344
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:32,599
bongs and hash you know powdered out

345
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,879
hashes it's not a good look it's not a

346
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,720
good look let's just be honest so I know

347
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:39,720
we're getting stoned

348
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:42,000
but this is a fun part tell us about the

349
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:44,759
headband or the sweatband it definitely

350
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,320
is true to its name first of all he took

351
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:49,278
the headband and he crossed it with what

352
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,680
to make the sweat band that's what we

353
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:52,759
got to know we'll get him to we'll get

354
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:54,919
him to put it in the yes in the comment

355
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:56,360
section Phil will tell us what he gave

356
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:58,719
this to me and I should know and it was

357
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,720
a nice should know told me the other day

358
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,839
but too high right now to to think that

359
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:06,278
far back you just see what I just hit so

360
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,680
it was a big rip it was definitely one

361
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:09,838
of those rips that everyone at the

362
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:12,559
Cannabis Cup wants to give me yeah hey

363
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:14,839
bu man you want to rip I guess let's end

364
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:16,838
this day right here yeah I don't care if

365
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:17,920
it's a big rip as long as it's clean

366
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:19,320
yeah true you know what I mean if you

367
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:20,679
give me something that's not clean and I

368
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,759
have to take too much of it then it's

369
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:25,479
like wao yeah the SWAT B is is pretty

370
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:28,278
cheesy though like cheesier than it's

371
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:29,560
not like cheese but it's it's funky it's

372
00:14:28,278 --> 00:14:31,480
funky

373
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:33,919
I like it sometimes the Hindu comes out

374
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:36,680
a little bit cheese ask as well and I

375
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:38,198
would say that it's not a bad I prefer

376
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:41,838
that flavor honestly over a lot of the

377
00:14:38,198 --> 00:14:43,919
fruity ones myself but to each their own

378
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,560
cheese it's a little bit cheesy it's not

379
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:47,958
like the cheese but it's definitely got

380
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:49,359
some some funk to it I'll tell you for

381
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:52,479
the size of the rip I

382
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:54,519
took that's a lot of of smoke that It

383

395

so awesome stay tuned it's getting good

407
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:52,959
I think 73 we're going to have a hash

408
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:54,040
episode we'll have these guys on

409
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:55,758
hopefully going to invite a bunch of

410
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:58,360
other different people that are actively

411
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,680
making hash on the regular and just have

412
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:02,360
a great episode episode about talking

413
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:04,799
about hash and talking about Little T

414
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:06,720
tips and tricks and different subtleties

415
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:08,599
and nuances that we all find and see

416
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,240
when we're making hash we look forward

417
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,680
to it absolutely it's going to be

418
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,278
definitely share some knowledge get some

419
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:15,879
get some tips so that was three bubble

420
00:16:14,278 --> 00:16:18,879
hashes we did want to finish it off with

421
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:20,278
a rosin rip um tell us about the rosin

422
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:23,039
that we're hitting today uh this is some

423
00:16:20,278 --> 00:16:24,759
master Scout uh rosin which is another

424
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:27,838
one of my favorite flavors uh at least

425
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:29,399
in our quiver um it's super super lemony

426
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,920
go hold it up to the camera that one you

427
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:32,679
can do just hold your hand in the back

428
00:16:30,919 --> 00:16:35,039
there and it'll clear right up you can

429
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:36,479
go close close close and it'll grab once

430
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:38,159
everything else disappears probably

431
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,199
right around

432
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:43,919
there yeah so it's definitely uh very

433
00:16:41,198 --> 00:16:45,679
nice looking rosin pretty lemony uh on

434
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:47,559
this on the flavor but it's like a lemon

435
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:49,239
soap it might be my favorite type of

436
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:52,278
rosin that you guys make it's just that

437
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:54,240
Jack Frost Master Scout combo it goes so

438
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:56,919
well with almost any of the turfs I've

439
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:59,318
tried done lemon cush

440
00:16:56,919 --> 00:17:01,759
tur I like it better with the the Hindu

441
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:03,799
honestly really the purple Hindu it's

442
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,160
phenomenal it's nuts wow it's a

443
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:08,159
different thing shout out to Blue River

444
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:10,279
for that very good very good I like it I

445
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:13,319
like it yeah I think I think you'll like

446
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:16,759
it and this one actually is one of the

447
00:17:13,318 --> 00:17:19,038
sometimes the um the hash rosin can get

448
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:20,798
a little bit buttered out or something

449
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:23,279
if the hash hasn't been like fully fully

450
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:25,519
dried or you know just little things

451
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:26,879
like that can can change the the way

452
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:29,879
that the hash comes out but this one

453
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:32,200
stayed really stable man this one's nice

454
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:36,720
yeah I

455
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:38,279
know super L yeah it's like Lemon Pledge

465

rip it was the shadow of the tip I was

473
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:24,280
like did I give him that with dirt on it

474
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:26,119
and then when he looked at it it kind of

475
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:28,240
made me doubt myself like I think I

476
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:31,599
might have given it to him a little bit

477
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:33,558

for this to happen for years why I

524
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:27,159
always wondered when I when it was me 15

525
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:28,359
to 17 years ago in Vancouver and no one

00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:29,880
was doing it I was like I wonder how

527
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:32,839
long this will take to get everyone

528
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:34,480
doing it and it's like 20 years later
