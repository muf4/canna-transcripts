00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,199
about to start some history right now

67
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:14,360
dude we are about to start some history

68
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:16,478
we've been driving around for the last 3

69
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:19,199
hours maybe I'd say two to three okay

70
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:21,120
and just to find these these are not

71
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,120
easy to find in Jamaica everyone's got

72
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,560
one but good luck finding one to buy we

73
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,199
managed to find too because of course

74
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,759
we're with prey and when prey uh when

75
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,598
you ask prey to find him you a bucket

76
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,759
he's going to find us a bucket so

77
00:06:31,598 --> 00:06:35,120
basically we're on our way now to the

78
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,400
place where I think we're going to be

79
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,199
meeting our friends and then heading

80
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:40,239
over to the field or perhaps they'll

81
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:41,478
already have the herb there either way

82
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,800
we're going to be making bubble real

83
