latest in cannabis research policy and

18
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:41,239
science with Dr David Allen on the

19
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:44,078
Cannabis Journal Club welcome

20
00:00:41,238 --> 00:00:46,078
David good morning good afternoon now I

21
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,679
guess yeah it's good morning good

22
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,000
afternoon good evening there's people

23
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:51,679
all over the world so let's hit them all

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,840
all

25
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:56,558
right wonderful so yeah today we're

26
00:00:53,840 --> 00:01:01,359
going to be talking about the mother of

27
00:00:56,558 --> 00:01:04,840
all hanabono patents is that correct

28
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:07,680
perfect please give us give us the the

29
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:10,478
knowledge all right um I'm going to give

30
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,720
it a A Brief Review of the mother of all

31
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:14,879
cannabis

32
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:17,798
patents and uh it's it's entitled

33
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:21,438
cannaboids as antioxidants and

34
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:27,320
neuroprotectants patent number

35
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:31,639
6,630 57 it came out in October 7th of

36
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:34,599
2003 and um we're reviewing in patents

37
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:37,200
and U scientific articles about cannabis

38
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:39,839
and and the reason we're reviewing

39
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,920
patents is because the patent office is

40
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,759
The Keeper of the truth because you

41
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:48,159
can't make any mistakes uh on a patent

42
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,959
application and get a patent number

43
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:54,960
assigned to it so it in effect is The

44
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:56,639
Keeper of the truth and um this cannabis

45
00:01:54,959 --> 00:02:01,239
patent

46
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:05,560
um 6 comma 630a 5 7 came out on October

47
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:07,280
7th of 2003 uh and was issued from by

48
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:10,080
the Department of Health and Human

49
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,800
Services which means this as a United

50
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:16,319
States

51
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:19,040
patent uh and uh it proves in this that

52
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:20,759
it decreases the size of a stroke by

53
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:23,878
half or

54
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:26,120
50% and

55
00:02:23,878 --> 00:02:30,239
uh

56
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:33,759
so this patent uh proved this by doing

57
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:37,120
an experimentation on rats where they

58
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:39,919
uded uh middle cerebal artery of the

59
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:43,319
rats for a time period and open the

60
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:46,199
artery and then looked at the brains

61
00:02:43,318 --> 00:02:49,479
afterwards and found out that that the

62
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:52,039
the size of the stroke was 50% smaller

63
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:55,719
and so that's hard scientific evidence

64
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:58,280
that this works in an animal model and

65
00:02:55,719 --> 00:03:00,400
it's kind of a sin that this has not

66
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:05,360
been tested in

67
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:07,480
humans since 2003 because uh everybody

68
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,239
going to the hospital with a stroke or

69
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:15,439
heart attack might have had

70
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:19,719
their uh mortality morbidity improved by

71
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:24,158
taking CBD or or THC and this proves uh

72
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:26,439
in this that THC and CBD both are uh

73
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:29,479
efficacious in decreasing the size of a

74
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:30,719
stroke and they prefer CBD of course

75
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:32,959
because

76
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:34,799
it doesn't fully bind to the CB1

77
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,598
receptor and therefore it doesn't get

78
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:40,920
you high whereas C THC does bind to the

79
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:43,000
receptor and and gets you high and that

80
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:44,598
would change your neurological

81
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,759
examination

82
00:03:44,598 --> 00:03:52,919
so um C CBD doesn't bind onto the CB1

83
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:56,000
receptor uh very strongly and THC does I

84
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:58,719
have a question yes what is the

85
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,919
comparable medication for the reduction

86
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:03,000
of stroke after after these operations

87
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:05,318
do they have because I remember Dr Brent

88
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,560
Reynolds telling me about like uh tumor

89
00:04:05,318 --> 00:04:09,238
medications that shrink tumor in like

90
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,920
they shrink the maximum they shrink it

91
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:13,759
is

92
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:15,280
10% they cause neuropathy in like 85% of

93
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:16,959
the patients so they have to stop taking

94
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,160
it and this drug does billions of

95
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,600
dollars in profit annually and in the

96
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:25,520
meantime the comparable like the

97
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:27,400
apoptosis cannaboids is like whoa the so

98
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:30,519
is there a comparable medication CU When

99
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:32,359
you say 50% that's obviously a massive

100
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:34,680
number are maybe people aren't hearing

101
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:37,479
it that's pretty profound from the heart

102
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:39,840
surgeons per perspective no I don't want

103
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:43,639
to talk about oncologists because

104
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:45,159
they're the enemy uh but

105
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:48,160
uh

106
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,160
so

107
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:55,160
um so what was your question again just

108
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,439
just whether there was a medication that

109
00:04:55,160 --> 00:05:00,520
offered this lack

110
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:02,800
of all right so there are some other

111
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:05,399
things vitamin C and other things that

112
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,800
are antioxidants but they don't

113
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:11,638
generally cross the blood brain barrier

114
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:14,960
where CBD and THC does and so has good

115
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:18,879
penetration and this this patent is is

116
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:24,000
based on the scientific evidence that

117
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:27,519
CBD and THC both stop reperfusion

118
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:31,639
injury and we'll go into that uh in

119
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:34,719
another uh segment of our uh articles

120
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:38,439
but uh basically when you when you stop

121
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:40,880
blood flow to an organ uh the cells that

122
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:43,839
are farthest away from the blood supply

123
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:46,279
die first so the center of the the

124
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:49,119
stroke starts from the very center and

125
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:53,599
then there's a surrounding area

126
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:56,120
of cells that are stunned but if you

127
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,919
return the blood flow to them they'll

128
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,160
return they'll they'll they're still

129
00:05:58,918 --> 00:06:02,240
alive

130
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:07,880
but the center is is dead but the

131
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:12,720
surrounding tissue is is um hindered and

132
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:16,680
it's it's and what happens in in Strokes

133
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:19,360
is is when you reap when you restore the

134
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,598
blood flow to an area that's been cut

135
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,960
off from blood

136
00:06:20,598 --> 00:06:26,839
supply what happens is uh some chemical

137
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:29,879
processes that make the stroke worse and

138
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:32,959
it's called reperfusion injury and what

139
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:36,399
happens is uh when

140
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:40,120
you put the blood flow back to the area

141
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:42,719
that's been denied oxygen and blood what

142
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:44,399
happens is there's a massive release of

143
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,000
a

144
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:48,758
neurotransmitter called glutamate and

145
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,639
it's a it's a

146
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:56,400
neurotransmitter and it it does some

147
00:06:52,639 --> 00:07:00,280
harmful things what it does is it causes

148
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:02,959
calcium to go into the cell

149
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:05,598
which kills the additional cells and

150
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:08,120
makes makes the stroke worse it's called

151
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:10,159
reperfusion injury and that was my job

152
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:14,560
as a heart surgeon to prevent

153
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:18,160
reperfusion injury and when I read this

154
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:20,319
patent the first time it it had some

155
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,439
information in it that really changed my

156
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,319
life as a heart surgeon it and it says

157
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:28,000
in

158
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:31,319
here that uh CBD and THC I'm

159
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,800
paraphrasing is uh uh can be used for

160
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:37,520
Alzheimer's disease Parkinson's disease

161
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:42,918
Down syndrome

162
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:45,240
HIV M cardio infarction or treatment and

163
00:07:42,918 --> 00:07:47,359
prevention of

164
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:50,280
interoperative or

165
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:53,199
peroperative hypoxic insults that can

166
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:55,679
leave permanent Strokes

167
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:58,598
basically uh and

168
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,959
following open heart surgery requiring

169
00:07:58,598 --> 00:08:06,319
heart lung body bypass machines such as

170
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:11,120
coronary artery bypass graphs cabbage so

171
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:14,919
I read this back right after 2003 and I

172
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:18,000
knew wow man this is like a miracle and

173
00:08:14,918 --> 00:08:22,198
I couldn't tell any of my fellow doctors

174
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:25,879
about this because it was out me as uh

175
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:28,800
somebody that was promoting the Cannabis

176
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:30,720
science and so I really I was afraid to

177
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,639
even share this with other doctors

178
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,879
because it would affect my

179
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:39,278
income and

180
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:44,320
so um maybe your freedom too

181
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:46,159
yeah and um so this information is

182
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:50,399
actually hidden in the literature

183
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:54,439
because this scientific uh literature

184
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:57,679
basically requires you to have a

185
00:08:54,440 --> 00:09:01,240
biochemistry uh degree so you can

186
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:03,879
interpret the gibberish that is in this

187
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:06,039
patent so 90% of the people that would

188
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:09,399
read this pattern wouldn't know what

189
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:12,159
they read unless they uh were told what

190
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:14,879
to look for uh and so that's what we're

191
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:19,600
here for we're here to interpret

192
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:22,838
scientific jargon into easily consumable

193
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:25,959
language that most people can understand

194
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:28,519
and once they get educated in this

195
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:31,799
hidden information they're going to be

196
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:33,799
able to affect the world in a way that

197
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:35,879
will make this even more

198
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:37,639
widespread

199
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:42,879
so

200
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:46,000
uh so that's what our goal here is is to

201
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:48,679
to spread the information that's hidden

202
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,600
in the scientific jargon and make it

203
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:57,278
easily consumable so you can tell your

204
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:59,920
doctor about this and I can bet anybody

205
00:09:57,278 --> 00:10:03,360
that's watching this if you ask your

206
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:06,159
doctor or heart surgeon if they know

207
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,879
about this cannabis patent cannaboids as

208
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:11,480
antioxidants and neuro protections they

209
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:14,720
won't have any

210
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:18,480
idea uh about its ex

211
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:21,639
existence and uh so you will be able to

212
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,120
teach your doctors about this and this

213
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:26,439
will change

214
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:28,440
society agreed so to do a quick short

215
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:30,200
breakdown on the things that Dr David

216
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,480
Allen just broke down down from this

217
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:34,480
patent you've got the antioxidant

218
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,278
properties which cannaboids have been

219
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,759
identified as having antioxidant

220
00:10:36,278 --> 00:10:40,480
properties independent of nmda receptor

221
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:42,000
antagonisms making them potentially

222
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,079
useful in treating a variety of

223
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,078
oxidation Associated diseases we have

224
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:49,039
neuroprotective applications which is

225
00:10:47,078 --> 00:10:50,838
the patent specifically notes which Dr

226
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:52,480
David Allen just spoke about the

227
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:55,360
potential of cannaboids and limiting

228
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,079
neurological damage post ischemic events

229
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,800
like stroke and intreatment

230
00:10:57,078 --> 00:11:01,679
neurodegenerative diseases such as

231
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:03,439
alzheim Parkinson's and HIV dementia

232
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:05,239
then you've got the non psychoactive

233
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,880
cannabinoids which emphasizes the use of

234
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:09,159
non- psychoactive cannabinoids like CBD

235
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:10,720
for their benefits without the

236
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:13,838
psychoactive effects that come with high

237
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:16,959
doses of THC thus avoiding toxicity

238
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:18,920
issues and then finally the research uh

239
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:20,759
and potential you know this document

240
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:23,078
includes data from experiments showing

241
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:25,399
that cannabinoids like CBD can act as

242
00:11:23,078 --> 00:11:27,799
potent antioxidants with some efficacy

243
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:31,440
Superior to traditional antioxidants

244
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:33,359
like ascorbate or Alpha talker all uh in

245
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,200
certain context so is that kind of a

246
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:39,120
good breakdown on what we're saying

247
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:43,278
that's exactly right and so uh and CBD

248
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:47,519
this this patent proves that CBD is safe

249
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:49,200
in large doses extremely large doses

250
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,600
even if you give it

251
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,240
chronically it doesn't have any side

252
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:57,360
effects to it yeah and if you didn't

253
00:11:54,240 --> 00:12:00,360
miss the major hypocrisy of this being

254
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:02,440
the US government the patent stands out

255
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:05,360
because it acknowledges the medical

256
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:08,720
potential of cannabis compounds while

257
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:11,039
the plant itself remains classified

258
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,879
under restrictive legal categories in

259
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:15,838
many many regions it's federally illegal

260
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:18,958
almost throughout the entire United

261
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:23,279
States except maybe in elv musa's uh

262
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:26,278
living room yeah that's that's exactly

263
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:26,278
right

264
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:32,159
so there it is

265
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:34,078
thanks everyone for tuning in for our

266

Club we'll get a little smoother as we

268
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:40,600
go along we'll figure out how Dr David

269
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,360
and I are going to bounce off one

270
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,360
another and uh we're going to continue

271
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,039
to bring you great information like this

272
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:48,639
if you have information that you want us
