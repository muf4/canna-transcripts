00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:30,269

8
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,920

9
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,840
as well as his own UVC chemo Kush which

10
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,700
I actually acquired today that was a

11
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:47,579
real bonus Thank You Remo thanking the

12
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:50,760
urban grower came home got the led lush

13
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:52,590
light did that video plugged it in

14
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:54,689
downstairs it's growing right now an

15
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:56,190
exit eh PS super excited about that I

16
00:00:54,689 --> 00:00:57,659
want to thank the guys from lush once

17
00:00:56,189 --> 00:01:00,808
again lush lighting if you want to check

18
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:03,448
those guys out don't make assumptions

19
00:01:00,808 --> 00:01:04,530
they're the new and improved LED light

20
00:01:03,448 --> 00:01:06,269
I'm gonna give it a shot

21
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:07,920
everyone's got an attitude and an

22
00:01:06,269 --> 00:01:09,269
opinion about these things but for me

23
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,368
personally what I'm going to do is I'm

24
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:13,228
gonna let the light do the talking I'm

25
00:01:11,368 --> 00:01:16,170
gonna grow glandular resin head so I'm

26
00:01:13,228 --> 00:01:18,929
gonna isolate them I'm gonna have h PS

27
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:21,840
and LED right next to one another so I

28
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:24,118
should have a h PS and an LED resin

29
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,670
content I've got the same plants from

30
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:29,060
the same cutting same phenotype on both

31
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:32,640
sides which is east coast Sour Diesel

32
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:35,368
sweet skunk and Condoleeza so it should

33
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,400
be pretty exciting I then came upstairs

34
00:01:35,368 --> 00:01:39,769
to find out that I got something really

35
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,140
exciting

36
00:01:39,769 --> 00:01:44,719
so this is a product that a friend of

37
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:46,460
mine has been making for some time and

38
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:48,259
it's a product that I have always

39
00:01:46,459 --> 00:01:50,719
supported I think it's just a really

40
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:55,250
cool product every time I post a picture

41
00:01:50,719 --> 00:02:00,649
of it or even mention it people trip so

42
00:01:55,250 --> 00:02:02,149
I figured it was time to share to cut

43
00:02:00,649 --> 00:02:05,118
that kind of thing this is you it just

44
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:08,538
wasn't happening look at this open here

45
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:14,379
so as you know being a bubble Man I

46
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:19,189
don't smoke joints another joint smoker

47
00:02:14,379 --> 00:02:20,449
is very nice very nice packaging not

48
00:02:19,189 --> 00:02:21,889
sure if any of you guys have seen this

49
00:02:20,449 --> 00:02:23,568
this is a good type of packaging they

50
00:02:21,889 --> 00:02:25,548
use on the toxic waste

51
00:02:23,568 --> 00:02:28,909
you just seal it on either side and you

52
00:02:25,549 --> 00:02:34,340
go over it with a iron I believe and it

53
00:02:28,909 --> 00:02:36,939
seals it right up so right fin 13 years

54
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:40,098
since I smoke joints a stool of joints I

55
00:02:36,939 --> 00:02:43,519
kind of missed them and so when I hooked

56
00:02:40,098 --> 00:02:45,439
into Matt in Toronto and he said oh here

57
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,469
I have one of these from so-and-so and I

58
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:49,509
said whoa where's he been I haven't seen

59
00:02:48,469 --> 00:02:52,159
him in years

60
00:02:49,509 --> 00:02:54,078
well he was here apparently well okay I

61
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:57,079
didn't get to see him but I do have his

62
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:58,730
number so I contacted him and I saw hey

63
00:02:57,079 --> 00:03:00,590
can we get something going on for the

64
00:02:58,729 --> 00:03:03,048
bubble man and can we try some of your

65
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:05,599
wonderful products and he said

66
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:11,480
absolutely and he sent me a little

67
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:14,840
package so really nice packaging that

68
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:16,669
you've done there my friend will mention

69
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,739
your name because I don't know that you

70
00:03:16,669 --> 00:03:21,589
want your name mentioned but I'll tell

71
00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:23,810
you you know these are one of the most

72
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:27,349
impressive little products that you can

73
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:35,090
make in the cannabis industry in my

74
00:03:27,349 --> 00:03:37,939
opinion and there we go so it looks like

75
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:39,020
a bunch of straws what could that be the

76
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:45,889
balloon

77
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:49,640
well let's check this out ooh here we go

78
00:03:45,889 --> 00:03:53,509
so these ones are dry cept these are a

79
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:55,699
hundred percent dry cept and you really

80
00:03:53,509 --> 00:03:58,759
just have to see these to believe it so

81
00:03:55,699 --> 00:04:00,409
it puts them in straws okay I'm so

82
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:03,229
excited to show you guys this this is

83
00:04:00,409 --> 00:04:04,969
like this is what I'm talking about

84
00:04:03,229 --> 00:04:10,459
I could probably use a little dab or to

85
00:04:04,969 --> 00:04:16,699
push it out there's one we use the

86
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:19,360
quartz oh I see they just cracked right

87
00:04:16,699 --> 00:04:22,519
open the straws open up

88
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:25,129
so that straws cut in half and just

89
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:29,029
peels off the other one and then you can

90
00:04:25,129 --> 00:04:37,089
do the same thing down at the bottom see

91
00:04:29,029 --> 00:04:40,089
if you guys can see that there we go

92
00:04:37,089 --> 00:04:40,089
so

93
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:52,020
you see that that right there is a

94
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:58,000
hundred percent hash no paper no glue

95
00:04:52,019 --> 00:04:59,349
just good old hashish so here's

96
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,100
something you don't see every day

97
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:06,370
bubbleman smoking a joint now it's not

98
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:09,160
your everyday joint I will admit so he's

99
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:12,670
managed to come up with the real proper

100
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:14,110
amount of contaminant versus glandular

101
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:16,360
trichomes heads and when I say

102
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:18,189
contaminant it's probably capitate

103
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:21,550
stalks the system of hair is more so

104
00:05:18,189 --> 00:05:27,360
than actual plant matter you just get

105
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:27,360
that lit up real nice and take a hit

106
00:05:38,459 --> 00:05:42,209
so when your pup in a pure hashed went

107
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:44,280
like this the one thing I would say to

108
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:46,698
be careful about because it does have a

109
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:48,989
fair amount of air space in the center

110
00:05:46,699 --> 00:05:50,759
if you want to put the joint in front of

111
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:54,090
your teeth when you're taking rips just

112
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:59,639
because you could pull back potentially

113
00:05:54,089 --> 00:06:02,310
a little coal a little hash bomber a

114
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:03,990
little you know red-hot so you don't

115
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:11,160
want to do that also another thing when

116
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:16,728
you're smoking these don't try to fix

117
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:16,729
them if you see the ash leave with me

118
00:06:17,269 --> 00:06:23,129
bare we go

119
00:06:20,509 --> 00:06:24,960
leave it be don't try to fix the ash

120
00:06:23,129 --> 00:06:26,610
don't try to knock the ash off it [ __ ]

121
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:29,038
up the charity to raise a house join

122
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:32,870
this joint will burn right through and

123
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:32,870
in fact this joy weighs a gram

124
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:46,680
real nice taste on this it's apparently

125
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:48,029
the Bob of Kush been a while since I

126
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:55,379
smoked one of these peer house joints

127
00:06:48,029 --> 00:06:59,149
[ __ ] love it mmm should probably take

128
00:06:55,379 --> 00:06:59,149
a Facebook update picture right

129
00:07:10,569 --> 00:07:16,459
Wow super nice you can see that ash hold

130
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:24,319
and hold and strong there hasn't dropped

131
00:07:16,459 --> 00:07:24,979
off real thick the beautiful smoke on

132
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,079
this too

133
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:30,860
not sure if you can notice in the camera

134
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:32,719
but it's a real blue smoke always a good

135
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:34,340
sign as a hash smoker when I see that

136
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,770
blue color and the smoke I'm much

137
00:07:34,339 --> 00:07:39,889
happier than if I see a gray color

138
00:07:36,769 --> 00:07:42,379
what is that according to I wouldn't

139
00:07:39,889 --> 00:07:44,899
suspect the ratio of terpenes and

140
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:48,409
cannabinoids versus plant matter waxes

141
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:50,029
and lipids whatever it just seems to be

142
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:59,360
a nice good sign when you get that blue

143
00:07:50,029 --> 00:08:04,549
smoke above halfway through the hash

144
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:07,129
droit here god it's nice to just be hit

145
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:09,980
and hit after hit after hit after hit

146
00:08:07,129 --> 00:08:12,469
and feel it completely in the top of my

147
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:19,819
head here I mean most people would put

148
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:22,490
this joint down right around now of

149
00:08:19,819 --> 00:08:24,800
course I've got those people I've been

150
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:28,490
puffing pretty chronic for about twenty

151
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:31,220
plus years hash for 13 plus years

152
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:33,168
chronically every day

153
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:36,440
I like these line in the hip hop song

154
00:08:33,168 --> 00:08:40,069
hip hop - reggae where he says you can

155
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:44,169
say it's habitual but every day it's a

156
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:44,169
ritual I like that

157
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:50,279
Wow I wish it would have brought these

158
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,320
two repos today I've been real nice to

159
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:55,110
smoke a joint with Remo those guys

160
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,760
passed me joints a hundred times today

161
00:08:55,110 --> 00:09:00,240
and a hundred times I went No thank you

162
00:08:56,759 --> 00:09:01,860
no thank you no thank you I don't smoke

163
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,629
paper and I don't smoke glue and that's

164
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:05,310
just the bottom line it's not anything

165
00:09:03,629 --> 00:09:07,049
against the the you know and I don't

166
00:09:05,309 --> 00:09:13,799
smoke herb as well so really those three

167
00:09:07,049 --> 00:09:15,029
things that's a pretty major pretty bad

168
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:21,079
you're full pump for me I just spoke

169
00:09:15,029 --> 00:09:25,319
cash so what better way to sort out me

170
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:28,520
them to let me smoke a pure hash joint

171
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:31,470
so you can see there we got that ash

172
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:32,759
looking okay nice and long this is right

173
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:35,340
around the time where people who try to

174
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:39,169
fix the ash don't [ __ ] do it

175
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:39,170
leave the ash alone

176
00:09:45,539 --> 00:09:50,860
the ash might even involve cooling the

177
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,519
cherry down a bit I don't know but it

178
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:56,230
seems to like you break the ash off what

179
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:59,019
seems to happen is at the bottom there

180
00:09:56,230 --> 00:10:00,909
where you see the black ring it seems to

181
00:09:59,019 --> 00:10:01,839
let loose right there and it starts to

182
00:10:00,909 --> 00:10:05,740
crumble and fall away

183
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:07,769
if you break off the ash so don't do

184
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,769
that

185
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:23,269
a little piece of - gave apart there at

186
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:26,509
my boat but I mean what a nice trip tree

187
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:27,649
that is right that is just a beautiful

188
00:10:26,509 --> 00:10:33,100
thing right there

189
00:10:27,649 --> 00:10:33,100
pure hash joint a grin good lovin life

190
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:40,009
now this is dry cept he does make bubble

191
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:45,470
hash ones as well I think these ones

192
00:10:40,009 --> 00:10:50,059
might be bubble hash yeah yeah these are

193
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:56,080
the bubble hash ones right here so these

194
00:10:50,059 --> 00:10:58,609
ones are 70% chocolate chunk and 30%

195
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:00,770
ak47 bubble hash and then these other

196
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:03,200
ones too bubba kush are 100% dry scent

197
00:11:00,769 --> 00:11:04,779
so Maddie's done a nice job on this and

198
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:09,980
then he sent me some of his new ones

199
00:11:04,779 --> 00:11:13,189
which are 50 percent of it is hemp star

200
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:16,100
bud ground into powder and then remixed

201
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:18,260
into 50 percent dry set so probably

202
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:21,670
going to share those with Remo once

203
00:11:18,259 --> 00:11:21,669
again I have no interest in smoking herb

204
00:11:24,929 --> 00:11:29,278
but my good friend Reba loves it and I

205
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:31,350
love that we have such different

206
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:34,470
perspectives such different full

207
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:35,970
appreciation for the plant but coming

208
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:38,339
from a different perspective Rima loves

209
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:40,139
the bud he loves the joints he loves

210
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:41,459
looking at buds and thinking man I'm

211
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:44,399
gonna roll that up and smoke it

212
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:46,198
I love the resin I still love the buds

213
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,360
and I love photographing them and I love

214
00:11:46,198 --> 00:11:50,008
looking at them and smelling them but

215
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,928
I'm really most inspired when I'm

216
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:54,389
extracting and isolating the resin heads

217
00:11:51,928 --> 00:12:04,519
off of the body that's that's where I

218
00:11:54,389 --> 00:12:08,879
get my kicks using the mothership bowl

219
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:15,269
that I guess could be kind of like as an

220
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:17,339
ashtray that's how we do that's the

221
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:19,438
entire ash of this joint is still on

222
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:22,439
here even though it's shorter than it

223
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:24,899
was it's sort of shrunk in its there

224
00:12:22,438 --> 00:12:26,879
hasn't been any ash drop so and the ash

225
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:29,839
is quite a nice grayish white color it's

226
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:29,839
certainly not overly dark

227
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:42,190
oh yeah now we're getting down to it

228
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:44,649
real real nice this is the last little

229
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:46,180
bit of this joint and this is really

230
00:12:44,649 --> 00:12:48,639
where you make the decision if you're

231
00:12:46,179 --> 00:12:50,319
going to smoke this nice and clean and

232
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,149
finish it right to the end or if

233
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,370
someone's going to get impatient knock

234
00:12:52,149 --> 00:12:58,240
off the ash and the cherry and [ __ ] it

235
00:12:54,370 --> 00:13:00,070
all up so I'm going to go for the first

236
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,190
one which is puff it right down to the

237
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:02,190
end

238
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:22,700
- bummer and that's awesome like that

239
00:13:14,179 --> 00:13:24,259
bad boy out now puffing down clean the

240
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:26,470
building joints that I need to smoke

241
00:13:24,259 --> 00:13:34,009
these days you know pure unadulterated

242
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:36,050
hash joints free people that asked me on

243
00:13:34,009 --> 00:13:39,078
the regular what should I do with my non

244
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:41,629
melty bubble you should roll that [ __ ]

245
00:13:39,078 --> 00:13:43,939
into hash joints how do I do this bubble

246
00:13:41,629 --> 00:13:45,708
man how do I do this okay this is my

247
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:48,050
friends method I have no idea exactly

248
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:50,419
what he's doing but I can tell you what

249
00:13:48,049 --> 00:13:53,149
I would try to do this very same thing I

250
00:13:50,419 --> 00:13:54,979
would laminate out squares of hash in

251
00:13:53,149 --> 00:13:57,350
grams and I would get them to a certain

252
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:59,360
thickness and to a certain size I would

253
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:01,100
roll them up just like he's doing I

254
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,470
suspect he puts a toothpick or something

255
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:06,019
on the inside freezes them in the fridge

256
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:07,670
of the freezer cools them and then

257
00:14:06,019 --> 00:14:09,919
removes the toothpick from the center

258
00:14:07,669 --> 00:14:11,750
this is what I suspect he's doing I

259
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:13,549
don't think it's a huge secret I think

260
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:15,350
other people have done it I'm seeing

261
00:14:13,549 --> 00:14:19,059
them sold as Pixy Stix down in

262
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:19,060
California ten plus years ago

263
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:27,000
and I think they've been for sale for

264
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:30,269
you know 12 plus years here in British

265
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,519
Columbia so a really cool little thing

266
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:35,309
though man I'm telling you that's one

267
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:40,879
happy bubble man puffing on that [ __ ]

268
00:14:35,309 --> 00:14:40,879
Kootenay baba cush

269
00:14:49,438 --> 00:14:55,058
well they didn't count how many rips I

270
00:14:52,299 --> 00:14:57,248
got but there's any really gum the

271
00:14:55,058 --> 00:14:59,528
[ __ ] out there that want to go back in

272
00:14:57,249 --> 00:15:02,439
the video and count how many rips I got

273
00:14:59,528 --> 00:15:06,539
I've gotta think I got fifty did I get

274
00:15:02,438 --> 00:15:06,539
fifty I'm not

275
00:15:15,299 --> 00:15:20,458
well that is just about ready to fall

276
00:15:21,688 --> 00:15:29,078
beautiful

277
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:34,449
so we peeled it off nicely there's the

278
00:15:29,078 --> 00:15:38,789
ash and there's the the roach that was a

279
00:15:34,448 --> 00:15:38,789
one ish ash going right there

280
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:54,320
oh yeah so I made a little brooch like

281
00:15:52,129 --> 00:15:55,730
this you know if it was just paper and a

282
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,280
little bit of herb even if you have your

283
00:15:55,730 --> 00:16:01,850
supercharged thing going on in there it

284
00:15:58,279 --> 00:16:03,850
would certainly not be the equivalent of

285
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:07,550
what's here right now this is still

286
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:12,639
three big dabs or at least one really

287
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:12,639
big dab let me smoke down nice and slow

288
00:16:16,029 --> 00:16:21,230
just cuz I wanted to show you the

289
00:16:18,049 --> 00:16:21,979
absolute perfection that my friend has

290
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:26,170
developed

291
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:28,909
what's with this particular method I

292
00:16:26,169 --> 00:16:32,329
don't know how he does it so perfect but

293
00:16:28,909 --> 00:16:33,829
it burns to near perfection every time

294
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:35,540
I've ever smoked one of these it's only

295
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:43,370
when someone messes with it that it

296
00:16:35,539 --> 00:16:46,159
falls apart and I'm not sure why when

297
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:48,799
you're smoking a roach but it makes it

298
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:54,860
more efficient by just sort of squinting

299
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:56,089
one eye I'm not even sure I could hit

300
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:57,680
this without squinting that eye

301
00:16:56,090 --> 00:17:00,889
what's up with a hot I mean you guys

302
00:16:57,679 --> 00:17:02,809
ever notice that that's weird

303
00:17:00,889 --> 00:17:09,579
look I got hot on my finger I'm getting

304
00:17:02,809 --> 00:17:15,230
close dropped her there she is everyone

305
00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:18,708
the end of the joint tiny little cherry

306
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:22,990
and I didn't even actually burn the will

307
00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:26,660
get it right in here with the ashtray

308
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:29,569
well there you have it smoked down too

309
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:32,120
darn near nothing of course you could

310
00:17:29,569 --> 00:17:34,629
always throw this in a pipe I think I

311
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:34,629
have one right here

312
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:42,769
careful Pedro lamp I mean I guess we

313
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:45,548
might as well finish it right finish

314
00:17:42,769 --> 00:17:52,429
what we started

315
00:17:45,548 --> 00:18:01,700
okay just got to too darn small for its

316
00:17:52,429 --> 00:18:03,730
own good looks okay time to finish you

317
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,730
off

318
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:16,500
[Laughter]

319
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:17,940
a little bit harsh in a bomb grip a

320
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:29,909
little bit but that's again because I

321
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:34,259
just smoked the whole gram a bit who

322
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:49,549
without what was tasty whew that was a

323
00:18:34,259 --> 00:18:54,319
tasty rib that's er that's her

324
00:18:49,548 --> 00:18:54,319
need to be smoking the last of the ash

325
00:18:54,528 --> 00:19:02,819
beautiful well there you have it Stace

326
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:06,990
stay tuned for a potential address
