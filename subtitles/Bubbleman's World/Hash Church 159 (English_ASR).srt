have an older child though don't you

193
00:08:13,228 --> 00:08:18,478
I absolutely do and in fact my older

194
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:22,019
child lately has jumped into the

195
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:24,598
wonderful world of building his own

196
00:08:22,019 --> 00:08:27,778
gaming PC so we've spent the last few

197
00:08:24,598 --> 00:08:30,478
days buying components off of Amazon so

198
00:08:27,778 --> 00:08:32,219
he can build this PC so I'm kind of

199
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:34,708
excited for him to enter that world it

200
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:36,509
was not a world I ever entered but it's

201
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:38,668
definitely a cool world that maybe could

202
00:08:36,509 --> 00:08:40,168
lead him into coding or some other kind

203
00:08:38,668 --> 00:08:43,259
of interesting things in regards to

204
00:08:40,168 --> 00:08:44,879
playing with computers at least he has

205
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:46,980
the interest and as something he wants

206
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:49,620
to do I used to I remember those little

207
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:51,240
kits the radio kits and stuff he used to

208
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,509
get at RadioShack and I used to love

209
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,629
putting together the Transit

210
00:08:52,509 --> 00:08:58,000
and the FM and then you had the 60 lift

211
00:08:55,629 --> 00:08:59,860
different components ones and I mean I

212
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,419
wish I would have had access to computer

213
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:03,430
components so that I could actually

214
00:09:01,419 --> 00:09:04,809
build a computer now you can just go I

215
00:09:03,429 --> 00:09:07,659
need this and he do this and it's and

216
00:09:04,809 --> 00:09:09,669
this and I need the box and I mean it's

217
00:09:07,659 --> 00:09:11,319
incredible what they can do so is he

218
00:09:09,669 --> 00:09:13,269
into minecraft or anything like that or

219
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:15,160
is he just into Minecraft when he was

220
00:09:13,269 --> 00:09:17,740
quite a bit younger like maybe around 11

221
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:20,259
he's 14 now so he's into like you know

222
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:22,539
just like any type of violent game that

223
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:25,750
he can like hunt and kill zombies or

224
00:09:22,539 --> 00:09:27,909
like creatures or you know he's a 14

225
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:29,620
year old boy I mean I'm pretty sure all

226
00:09:27,909 --> 00:09:33,189
of you guys were 14 year old boys at one

227
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:37,169
point in time so yeah the most wholesome

228
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:40,090
entertainment yet the key thing is boy

229
00:09:37,169 --> 00:09:44,500
yeah he really is the quintessential so

230
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:45,700
it's awesome I like it he's he grateful

231
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:48,279
for supporting it and you know

232
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:50,470
encouraging that you know oh yeah I

233
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:52,120
support whatever my kids are into you

234
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:53,769
know it's when he came to me and wanted

235
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:55,720
to learn to play piano when he was like

236
00:09:53,769 --> 00:09:58,360
11 years old and he was like hey I want

237
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:00,040
to learn piano I was like what all right

238
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,139
kind of got him this little toy piano

239
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:03,939
music can I take lessons here's like I

240
00:10:02,139 --> 00:10:05,679
want to learn how to read music I was

241
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:08,440
like okay now he just reads music so

242
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:11,019
lately and Sam will hear today all the

243
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:12,070
songs in my house are all the songs from

244
00:10:11,019 --> 00:10:14,019
Rick and Morty

245
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:15,850
he's printed off the computer and

246
00:10:14,019 --> 00:10:17,710
learned on his computer and let me tell

247
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:19,930
you these are real songs these are not

248
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:22,150
simple like chop stick type [ __ ] this is

249
00:10:19,929 --> 00:10:23,919
I can't even understand this music at

250
00:10:22,149 --> 00:10:26,350
all I look at it and it looks like

251
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:28,000
another language so I'm always don't

252
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:32,560
he's getting schwifty

253
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:35,500
he is getting 50 I'll tell ya your mind

254
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:38,049
develops in ways that is just completely

255
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:40,750
it's a nonlinear thing it's like chess

256
00:10:38,049 --> 00:10:44,919
players they your dad we thinking about

257
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:48,519
what's next dude he's playing music fast

258
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:51,459
and turning the page I'm like what well

259
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:54,279
that's on the bright side I could read

260
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:58,600
and write music when I was a child I

261
00:10:54,279 --> 00:11:00,939
don't remember it at all nice that's Sam

262
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:04,990
style okay everyone's like this

263
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:07,960
all right III learned myself I learned

264
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:10,029
how to read music in chorus but I could

265
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:11,230
hear it and so where's my brother my

266
00:11:10,029 --> 00:11:14,110
father had perfect pitch

267
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:16,330
so I was always fascinated by music and

268
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:18,789
not as well as in math but I'm always

269
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:21,190
fascinated by music and so I picked up

270
00:11:18,789 --> 00:11:23,649
uh I remember a steel string guitar and

271
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:25,990
my brother had my brother's blind and so

272
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:28,720
he he played piano exceptionally well so

273
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:30,100
my aunt and uncle thought that if they

274
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,600
got him a guitar he would be able to do

275
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:33,970
that however the guitar is the steel

276
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:37,570
strings sears-roebuck piece of [ __ ] and

277
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:40,570
as I I know dr. scale though and we'll

278
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:44,470
definitely a test pressing your fingers

279
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:46,840
on those is as a beast and for a blind

280
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:49,300
person who reads Braille etcetera etc it

281
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:50,500
was just too hard for him so I was very

282
00:11:49,299 --> 00:11:52,419
fortunate to have a guitar around to

283
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,980
pick up otherwise I don't you know

284
00:11:52,419 --> 00:11:55,509
besides chorus I don't know where else I

285
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,129
would have been able to go with that but

286
00:11:55,509 --> 00:11:59,740
I was able to find bass and other things

287
00:11:57,129 --> 00:12:02,080
so I've really really a big huge

288
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:04,899
supporter of music and youth and ain't

289
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:07,540
no it really opens them the mind and the

290
00:12:04,899 --> 00:12:09,340
experience exponentially because you

291
00:12:07,539 --> 00:12:10,719
learn to listen to the parts of music

292
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:12,460
you don't just listen to a song you

293
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,410
learn to let as a bass player I learned

294
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:16,389
to pick up parts of songs and parts of

295
00:12:14,409 --> 00:12:18,100
things so that I had to study that and

296
00:12:16,389 --> 00:12:20,230
understand that follow the drummer and

297
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:22,090
you know not think as a guitar lead or

298
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:24,100
you know anything like that had to think

299
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:25,720
in a completely different mindset so it

300
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:28,000
also gives you different understandings

301
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:31,779
of your place in the music as well which

302
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,190
I know dr. Sheldon will you know to you

303
00:12:31,779 --> 00:12:35,500
know that's what makes a band you know

304
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:36,820
everybody has a piece and a part to it

305
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:39,519
and when you understand that I mean it's

306
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:41,890
it's a great understanding of concept

307
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:45,159
and idea and it opens the mind of so

308
00:12:41,889 --> 00:12:47,110
many other experiences and ability to

309
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:48,519
communicate with other people so I mean

310
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:49,960
you could be in a band or something like

311
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:52,269
that you know I'm saying and understand

312
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:53,860
yeah well and you know I know who-who

313
00:12:52,269 --> 00:12:55,539
wouldn't rather have their

314
00:12:53,860 --> 00:13:02,769
fourteen-year-old kid getting schwifty

315
00:12:55,539 --> 00:13:04,629
over squanching all day word the Rick

316
00:13:02,769 --> 00:13:06,039
and Morty's the Rick and Morty Sam and

317
00:13:04,629 --> 00:13:08,769
Mark are probably like what is this

318
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:10,029
strange language these to speak you guys

319
00:13:08,769 --> 00:13:11,439
got to get caught up on your Rick and

320
00:13:10,029 --> 00:13:12,610
Morty or you will not be able to

321
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:17,260
communicate with

322
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:19,089
into fourteen-year-old boys then you

323
00:13:17,259 --> 00:13:22,088
miss out on all the Szechuan sauce this

324
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:23,649
is true as well chill so I got Cuban

325
00:13:22,089 --> 00:13:28,060
chronic trying to get into the room

326
00:13:23,649 --> 00:13:31,419
right now he is uh he was gonna take us

327
00:13:28,059 --> 00:13:33,578
through his drying room and I guess he's

328
00:13:31,419 --> 00:13:36,189
like a lot of people in Oregon right now

329
00:13:33,578 --> 00:13:39,639
which is like we're in Washington for

330
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:42,130
that matter it got so cold a lot of

331
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:44,049
people's I saw Benson Elvis his field

332
00:13:42,129 --> 00:13:45,669
was frozen it was like fully fresh

333
00:13:44,049 --> 00:13:49,199
frozen on the field the other day like

334
00:13:45,669 --> 00:13:51,179
big beautiful plants just like fur rosin

335
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:53,440
pretty yeah that's gotta be

336
00:13:51,179 --> 00:13:56,559
nerve-wracking at Jazz faces it all

337
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,450
right nothing good about freezing your

338
00:13:56,559 --> 00:14:00,009
plants outside due to weather I mean

339
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:01,470
it's bad enough on your regular plants

340
00:14:00,009 --> 00:14:03,909
or any annuals or anything like that

341
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:06,879
I've been very fortunate never have to

342
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:08,559
have that issue or problem but I'm shout

343
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:11,169
out to those that are I know that's

344
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:16,929
frustrating as hell I mean because they

345
00:14:11,169 --> 00:14:19,569
and before porous plants pros did he say

346
00:14:16,929 --> 00:14:21,489
that his area in Southern Oregon or

347
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:25,720
wherever he was at was the most

348
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:27,250
beautiful place to grow cannabis Yeah

349
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:29,259
right before his the plants froze he

350
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:30,129
said that you are such a bastard it's

351
00:14:29,259 --> 00:14:33,669
awesome

352
00:14:30,129 --> 00:14:39,278
hey Mark my son Jake he's 20

353
00:14:33,669 --> 00:14:42,879
oh hey welcome Jake hey welcome all

354
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:52,059
right young shelters does your dad make

355
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:56,588
you play acoustic guitar too it's

356
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:59,649
convenient he plays drums that he plays

357
00:14:56,589 --> 00:15:01,329
bass an upright bass - nice

358
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:04,299
he played upright bass in the orchestra

359
00:15:01,328 --> 00:15:09,278
in a school orchestra but then you could

360
00:15:04,299 --> 00:15:12,039
play regular yeah a lot of drums linings

361
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:14,198
but you're right in the rhythm section

362
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:17,588
there so now you just sit in the pocket

363
00:15:14,198 --> 00:15:19,629
so right on I'm a bass player myself so

364
00:15:17,589 --> 00:15:20,829
I love the double bass just because I

365
00:15:19,629 --> 00:15:23,230
grew up in New Orleans with jazz and

366
00:15:20,828 --> 00:15:26,389
everything so kudos on that that's not

367
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:29,120
an easy instrument to pick up no it's

368
00:15:26,389 --> 00:15:30,889
instrument to bring around to pay in the

369
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:34,250
ass to bring bring from place to place

370
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:35,779
but it's a it's a it's rewarding once

371
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:37,309
you learn how to play an instrument like

372
00:15:35,779 --> 00:15:40,009
that for sure

373
00:15:37,309 --> 00:15:41,479
yep no I'm always staring what about I

374
00:15:40,009 --> 00:15:47,059
have seen what do you think about the

375
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:49,240
hash scene what what about it what about

376
00:15:47,059 --> 00:15:53,209
it it needs to come out to Pennsylvania

377
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:53,210
[Laughter]

378
00:15:54,129 --> 00:16:00,230
some some more progressive than others

379
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:03,970
obviously but no we thank you for years

380
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:07,220
all's you have to do is shake the trees

381
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:09,350
there's a clear yeah there's a clear

382
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:12,259
need in Montfort here I mean I can tell

383
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:14,480
you the Martin the market exists well

384
00:16:12,259 --> 00:16:15,889
it's coming up right there that we're

385
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,470
we're catering to you because they're

386
00:16:15,889 --> 00:16:20,210
the ones that got the money and it needs

387
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:32,330
to happen to me more money but they got

388
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:36,379
it yeah it's a Commonwealth right now

389
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:39,500
but uh Pennsylvania I feel like has has

390
00:16:36,379 --> 00:16:41,299
a long way to go just as a state but we

391
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:43,190
have a rich history you know in William

392
00:16:41,299 --> 00:16:45,349
Penn's Pennsylvania you were taxed if

393
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:47,330
you did not grow him yeah because what

394
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:50,480
did her Majesty need she needed ropes

395
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:52,670
and sails and oil and all kinds of [ __ ]

396
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:55,399
that you get from hemp so not too far my

397
00:16:52,669 --> 00:16:57,529
front door here West Hempfield was the

398
00:16:55,399 --> 00:17:01,279
was the cradle of the hemp industry

399
00:16:57,529 --> 00:17:04,369
during the 13 colonies when this was run

400
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:06,828
by William Patton we actually live in

401
00:17:04,369 --> 00:17:10,369
Penn Township the the Township that was

402
00:17:06,828 --> 00:17:13,279
allocated to the Penn family Penn pnn

403
00:17:10,369 --> 00:17:16,759
and yeah and he was a big advocate for

404
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:19,069
how they find here is they have the

405
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:21,170
millstones are conical that they used to

406
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:23,750
grind hemp with because I guess if you

407
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:26,209
use flat mill stones there's too much

408
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:29,119
surface area contact and you don't get

409
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:30,680
good you know draining of the the oil or

410
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:33,049
the flour or whatever they're grinding

411
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:35,180
with it so the clinical mill stones that

412
00:17:33,049 --> 00:17:40,000
they find in the old farms around here

413
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:43,640
Pennsylvania were used for hemp grinding

414
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,299
yeah conical millstones who would have

415
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:47,060
thought right

416
00:17:44,299 --> 00:17:48,799
it'd be cool how well I guess it would

417
00:17:47,059 --> 00:17:50,779
have never gone away had they not had it

418
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,369
not been from prohibition but also you

419
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:54,649
know the history of all of that stuff

420
00:17:52,369 --> 00:17:58,189
was so buried as well it's it's not as

421
00:17:54,650 --> 00:18:01,190
easy to find literally towns around here

422
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:03,200
named after Hampstead the hamper there's

423
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:05,509
a sewer district one West Hempfield up

424
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:09,830
where Millersville is Millersville

425
00:18:05,509 --> 00:18:10,339
University of my called less less Stark

426
00:18:09,829 --> 00:18:12,829
called

427
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:15,109
hemp stone heritage mark that actually

428
00:18:12,829 --> 00:18:16,970
less I've been trying to get less on

429
00:18:15,109 --> 00:18:20,599
hash search hopefully one day we can get

430
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:22,370
him on yeah um he's a he's an advocate

431
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:24,139
Harrisburg and he's written this book

432
00:18:22,369 --> 00:18:26,569
about about the hemp industry in

433
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:29,330
Pennsylvania mostly just by researching

434
00:18:26,569 --> 00:18:34,399
old newspaper articles and whatnot and

435
00:18:29,329 --> 00:18:36,139
just go into old libraries and digging

436
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:41,360
up stuff because it was a whole big

437
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:47,150
industry for a real real long time it

438
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:50,779
would still operate until the early yeah

439
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:52,910
so it's like it sucks that that doesn't

440
00:18:50,779 --> 00:18:55,539
exist anymore but it should come back

441
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:58,400
and our governor actually supports it

442
00:18:55,539 --> 00:19:00,859
they didn't have a hemp thing that

443
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:03,890
passed with the very large majority on

444
00:19:00,859 --> 00:19:04,990
both sides of the aisle so you know that

445
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:07,310
bill Ilana

446
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:09,620
there's a lot of interest in it but they

447
00:19:07,309 --> 00:19:11,929
only let these people grow very very

448
00:19:09,619 --> 00:19:15,500
small acreage they were only able to

449
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:17,000
grow somewhere between three and five

450
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:19,609
acres and I think we discussed on a

451
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,789
previous episode one of those was just

452
00:19:19,609 --> 00:19:26,059
at an old anthracite coal mine where

453
00:19:22,789 --> 00:19:28,639
they were just using the hemp field just

454
00:19:26,059 --> 00:19:31,129
as a fight over mediation process

455
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:35,120
because there was just basically a

456
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:39,020
barren wasteland things of this old

457
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:40,789
mining industry that used to mine coal

458
00:19:39,019 --> 00:19:43,129
and coal is pretty toxic there's a lot

459
00:19:40,789 --> 00:19:45,529
of toxic [ __ ] in coal but and and you

460
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:47,900
know they didn't throw any topsoil or

461
00:19:45,529 --> 00:19:49,190
they until it at all they just threw a

462
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:52,910
bunch seeds

463
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:54,860
down on this old Epsons with your old

464
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:58,430
processed you know tilling x' from the

465
00:19:54,859 --> 00:19:59,809
or and and and from the mine and what

466
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:02,960
did you know it that a whole bunch of

467
00:19:59,809 --> 00:20:04,460
plants still grew anyway you would think

468
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,650
that you know if you just throw seeds

469
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:07,100
out on this it's like it's in a parking

470
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:09,440
lot

471
00:20:07,099 --> 00:20:12,079
this stuff's not going to grow but

472
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:15,410
certainly a hole and in areas there were

473
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:17,869
clusters of plants that grew they're

474
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:22,220
just going to do some kind of study to

475
00:20:17,869 --> 00:20:24,889
see does that sort of remediate the soil

476
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:27,740
in a way that they could reclaim it for

477
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:30,080
agricultural or other use you know work

478
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:32,029
forces because right now I don't know

479
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:33,769
that it's a toxic waste site but I don't

480
00:20:32,029 --> 00:20:35,509
I think it's like dead land they can't

481
00:20:33,769 --> 00:20:37,609
do anything with there's whole there's

482
00:20:35,509 --> 00:20:39,170
whole sides of mountains in central

483
00:20:37,609 --> 00:20:41,119
Pennsylvania where you can go and that

484
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:43,160
the it's barren there's no trees there's

485
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:45,829
no anything because they just from mind

486
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:48,170
a tailings they don't deduce what they

487
00:20:45,829 --> 00:20:51,379
call mountain topping I don't think they

488
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:53,300
practice that and they still do they

489
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:55,940
still do eighteen in West Virginia where

490
00:20:53,299 --> 00:20:58,430
basically they just obliterate the top

491
00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:00,080
of the mountain no they don't way the

492
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:01,460
entire mountain starting from the top

493
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:03,289
down they just pin it all the way down

494
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:07,759
they need to they need to let Paul

495
00:21:03,289 --> 00:21:10,460
Stamets when you hear this [ __ ] in

496
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:13,039
the White House talk about go coal and

497
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:15,559
coal industry I mean we all need clean

498
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:19,399
air to breathe and clean water to drink

499
00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:21,799
and whole industry is never going to be

500
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:25,400
where it could be done safely such that

501
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:27,919
it provides you know energy that is safe

502
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:31,009
because all the people who live around

503
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:33,500
those areas are poisoned with toxic

504
00:21:31,009 --> 00:21:35,809
runoff and the mountains just look

505
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:38,089
horrible and they end up planning you

506
00:21:35,809 --> 00:21:39,889
know all kinds of green fields up there

507
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:42,769
so it looks like meadows and everything

508
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:45,800
but it used to be old-growth forests

509
00:21:42,769 --> 00:21:47,660
beautiful old-growth Cedars and yeah I

510
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:48,980
mean just how long just you can just

511
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:53,420
tell it looks like the Earth's been

512
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:56,960
scarred and it is very discard it was

513
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:58,119
like a haphazardly way almost like a

514
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,098
checkerboard kind

515
00:21:58,118 --> 00:22:02,048
thing where you see that certain plots

516
00:22:00,098 --> 00:22:04,418
of land we're like clear cutted and just

517
00:22:02,048 --> 00:22:06,098
I have faith in humans in nature right

518
00:22:04,419 --> 00:22:06,729
when I listen to this I think Paul

519
00:22:06,098 --> 00:22:08,739
Stamets

520
00:22:06,729 --> 00:22:10,538
I think let him go inoculate those

521
00:22:08,739 --> 00:22:12,969
mountains like he did with that style

522
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:19,479
like good inoculate the people first

523
00:22:12,969 --> 00:22:22,838
right it's the people who are that's the

524
00:22:19,479 --> 00:22:24,999
beauty don't get it right need to

525
00:22:22,838 --> 00:22:26,378
inoculate them with knowledge and a lot

526
00:22:24,999 --> 00:22:28,719
of good hell you know they're just

527
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:30,848
starting to get it now that their tap

528
00:22:28,719 --> 00:22:32,979
water is catching on fire their fracking

529
00:22:30,848 --> 00:22:34,688
those areas so bad I mean literally

530
00:22:32,979 --> 00:22:36,338
people are taking showers lighting

531
00:22:34,689 --> 00:22:39,939
candles and their bathrooms are blowing

532
00:22:36,338 --> 00:22:42,969
up yeah well that's not bad enough we've

533
00:22:39,939 --> 00:22:44,259
it free hot water what yeah but the

534
00:22:42,969 --> 00:22:46,929
thing is is that they're ramping the

535
00:22:44,259 --> 00:22:49,179
topsoil along with it so they're left

536
00:22:46,929 --> 00:22:51,669
with just rocky top so I don't see any

537
00:22:49,179 --> 00:22:55,538
hamper any grass really growing there I

538
00:22:51,669 --> 00:23:04,119
mean they probably everything my

539
00:22:55,538 --> 00:23:06,788
question for this is wade here in Nevada

540
00:23:04,118 --> 00:23:07,898
County we had gold mining back in the

541
00:23:06,788 --> 00:23:12,608
1800s

542
00:23:07,898 --> 00:23:14,438
and there's square miles of Nevada

543
00:23:12,608 --> 00:23:15,788
County that still looked like a

544
00:23:14,439 --> 00:23:18,729
moonscape

545
00:23:15,788 --> 00:23:21,219
it's just they did hydraulic mining and

546
00:23:18,729 --> 00:23:23,578
washed away all the soil to uncover

547
00:23:21,219 --> 00:23:25,989
gravel beds that had gold in it and

548
00:23:23,578 --> 00:23:29,979
meantime an extracting gold they left

549
00:23:25,989 --> 00:23:33,429
behind mercury there are mines in the

550
00:23:29,979 --> 00:23:36,219
area of old mines that water runs out of

551
00:23:33,429 --> 00:23:37,139
them that has arsenic and Mercury and

552
00:23:36,219 --> 00:23:39,999
dolphin

553
00:23:37,138 --> 00:23:42,368
all of these things to going on and so

554
00:23:39,999 --> 00:23:43,899
the question is and I don't know if Mark

555
00:23:42,368 --> 00:23:45,578
might be the one or Sam

556
00:23:43,898 --> 00:23:48,808
that would have an answer to this but

557
00:23:45,578 --> 00:23:52,269
because cannabis is a bio accumulator I

558
00:23:48,808 --> 00:23:54,999
one of the concerns I have is that it's

559
00:23:52,269 --> 00:23:57,878
it picks up these heavy metals as well

560
00:23:54,999 --> 00:24:00,459
as pesticides and fungicides that we've

561
00:23:57,878 --> 00:24:02,708
discussed at length but to what extent

562
00:24:00,459 --> 00:24:05,919
does cannabis concentrate things like

563
00:24:02,709 --> 00:24:07,839
mercury or arsenic or whatnot and what

564
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:10,899
do we do about using plants like that

565
00:24:07,838 --> 00:24:11,589
for medicine but I don't know exactly

566
00:24:10,898 --> 00:24:14,889
which

567
00:24:11,589 --> 00:24:18,759
he medals it picks up in the highest

568
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:20,620
concentrations I know you wouldn't have

569
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:22,778
to worry about gold or silver but

570
00:24:20,619 --> 00:24:27,509
unfortunately most of that's gone and

571
00:24:22,778 --> 00:24:31,240
what's left is the real toxic [ __ ] yeah

572
00:24:27,509 --> 00:24:32,798
can it I mean well that would have been

573
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:35,650
one of the big debates regarding

574
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:41,200
industrial hemp for reclamation projects

575
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:44,350
going back ninety sixth done at a farm

576
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:46,509
and putting a an old iron mill in Poland

577
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:50,230
and but they're even starting to do

578
00:24:46,509 --> 00:24:51,640
reclaim areas in Japan using hemp the

579
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:54,130
discussion is well what do you do with

580
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:57,130
this happen out because it's toxic it is

581
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:59,950
now and that would have I mean Fukushima

582
00:24:57,130 --> 00:25:01,570
and stuff would have full-on Fukushima

583
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:03,700
would have full-on a radioactivity

584
00:25:01,569 --> 00:25:05,769
isotopes inside the plants we know that

585
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:07,720
the plant can actually uptake those so

586
00:25:05,769 --> 00:25:08,980
then I've had this discussion many times

587
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:11,380
what do you do what do you do with these

588
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:13,329
plans you look nice drip them and a

589
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:15,700
fiber because if the fiber would

590
00:25:13,329 --> 00:25:21,519
possibly have radioactivity put the

591
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:24,069
lignin theoretically once it's been

592
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:28,359
sequestered in the plan and they've done

593
00:25:24,069 --> 00:25:30,519
this with things like malt and barley as

594
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:32,259
well because then as you know anyone

595
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:35,288
who's cooked from barley knows that

596
00:25:32,259 --> 00:25:38,769
barley absorbs many times its weight in

597
00:25:35,288 --> 00:25:40,869
water so barley has been used in in

598
00:25:38,769 --> 00:25:42,788
sequester once you have it sequestered

599
00:25:40,869 --> 00:25:45,129
now you can take that and in a

600
00:25:42,788 --> 00:25:47,798
controlled facility do an incineration

601
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:50,679
of that and capture the toxic metal in

602
00:25:47,798 --> 00:25:52,658
the ash in fact so concentrated can the

603
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:54,669
toxic metal be in the ash that they

604
00:25:52,659 --> 00:25:57,490
actually refine that to get the metal

605
00:25:54,669 --> 00:25:59,950
out so it actually is a cash flow

606
00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:03,308
positive situation if you're trying to

607
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:05,319
remove toxic [ __ ] like lead tin mercury

608
00:26:03,308 --> 00:26:10,329
because all those should have some

609
00:26:05,319 --> 00:26:12,700
industrial you know come on any value by

610
00:26:10,329 --> 00:26:14,408
final remediation in general you're

611
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:17,440
absolutely true and I think what Wade's

612
00:26:14,409 --> 00:26:20,110
concern is is that if you're cultivating

613
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:24,169
cannabis for human consumption and

614
00:26:20,109 --> 00:26:27,899
you're in these zones where there's been

615
00:26:24,169 --> 00:26:29,940
you know mining activity that has

616
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:32,240
completely destroyed the natural

617
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:34,890
landscape

618
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,599
Wade was saying they're seeing arsenic

619
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:39,809
and other things that have been

620
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:41,969
unearthed that would normally not be an

621
00:26:39,808 --> 00:26:44,069
issue if they've not done the mining

622
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:46,860
activity and the mining activity usually

623
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:48,720
leaves a trail of toxic there's

624
00:26:46,859 --> 00:26:50,668
Superfund sites and if you look at those

625
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,740
Superfund sites eight out of ten of them

626
00:26:50,669 --> 00:26:54,990
are mining sites were they basically

627
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:56,579
just mined stuff till it got so toxic

628
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:59,339
and then they just closed it's no longer

629
00:26:56,579 --> 00:27:01,740
economical and then created a Superfund

630
00:26:59,339 --> 00:27:03,658
site be cleaned up but the point is is

631
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:07,250
that if you're growing cannabis and your

632
00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:10,140
cannabis is exposed to those things

633
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:13,890
absolutely there could be some trace

634
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:15,809
level of some of these toxic if you're

635
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:17,610
using water that's not treated and

636
00:27:15,808 --> 00:27:21,720
you're not making sure that there's not

637
00:27:17,609 --> 00:27:26,219
you know those types of metals in your

638
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:27,569
water and arsenate is not arsenic is

639
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:31,769
actually funny because actually not a

640
00:27:27,569 --> 00:27:33,839
medics actually what they call a to semi

641
00:27:31,769 --> 00:27:36,480
metal it's almost a nonmetal but it's

642
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:39,269
not our arsenic itself it's not arsenic

643
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:41,788
metal but it's arsenate and arsenate

644
00:27:39,269 --> 00:27:44,429
which was in chrome aided copper

645
00:27:41,788 --> 00:27:47,460
arsenate which was the treatment for

646
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:49,409
pressure-treated lumber for years you

647
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:51,419
know those green telephone poles and the

648
00:27:49,409 --> 00:27:53,760
jungle gyms and the picnic tables and

649
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:55,919
all that green stuff was cremated copper

650
00:27:53,759 --> 00:28:00,419
arsenate and as long as that wood goes

651
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:03,360
out into eventually landfills and out of

652
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:06,480
service that arsenic leeches into

653
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:08,398
groundwater and that arsenic can if

654
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,890
you're using groundwater to water your

655
00:28:08,398 --> 00:28:13,949
cannabis plants could essentially create

656
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:16,799
a background level of arsenic in your in

657
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:18,210
your water in grow so yeah these are

658
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:20,579
things that you have to test your water

659
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:22,980
for and make sure ultimately you test

660
00:28:20,579 --> 00:28:25,769
your your flour and your your

661
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:27,390
concentrates to make sure that again I

662
00:28:25,769 --> 00:28:30,658
think the point that I think Wade was

663
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:32,940
bringing up which is that some you know

664
00:28:30,659 --> 00:28:36,690
cannabis production is in and around

665
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:38,240
areas where mining industry has left an

666
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:41,580
incredible

667
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:44,549
unbelievable bad impact on the local you

668
00:28:41,579 --> 00:28:47,309
know ground and and a local groundwater

669
00:28:44,549 --> 00:28:49,740
yes and the populations of people

670
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:51,659
because I don't know if correlated to

671
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:58,650
Matthews but there's a lot of Matthews

672
00:28:51,660 --> 00:29:00,810
in West Virginia I don't know yeah I

673
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:03,269
mean West Virginia we've been yeah we've

674
00:29:00,809 --> 00:29:06,240
been the glass industry here because

675
00:29:03,269 --> 00:29:09,119
these people's reliance on a on an

676
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:15,150
industry that is dying they don't know

677
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:16,919
how to adapt and how to grow and the

678
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:20,220
answer and every time he gets up there

679
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:23,310
and hopeful him and Scott Pruett should

680
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:27,569
go [ __ ] themselves because but what

681
00:29:23,309 --> 00:29:30,379
would job hey not you guys talking about

682
00:29:27,569 --> 00:29:34,829
politics Sonam but how about we welcome

683
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:37,050
D 420k into the room wait laughter into

684
00:29:34,829 --> 00:29:40,559
the room and someone who's never been on

685
00:29:37,049 --> 00:29:43,500
hash trips before a new panelist Cuban

686
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:46,470
chronic in the house it's going on did

687
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:48,619
last time I saw you you were surrounded

688
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:51,230
by huge plants last time I saw you

689
00:29:48,619 --> 00:29:54,989
yeah I'm surrounded by a DAB right now

690
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:56,309
alright well you do your dab and we'll

691
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:59,490
see what you have to show us in a little

692
00:29:56,309 --> 00:30:01,619
bit here definitely need it yeah we

693
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:06,390
could get the conversation back on track

694
00:30:01,619 --> 00:30:09,869
away from any politics will get

695
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:21,590
emotional although we were talking about

696
00:30:09,869 --> 00:30:21,589
coal we were talking house all right

697
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:38,970

698
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:41,009

to be told

717
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:27,079

00:31:35,069 --> 00:31:42,119
variety hold man you got a lot of

721
00:31:37,409 --> 00:31:44,010
variety in here but first I want to give

722
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:46,319
my respect all the panelists everybody

723
00:31:44,009 --> 00:31:50,158
on hash Church I really look forward to

724
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:51,689
watching it every week yeah well you've

725
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:55,110
been hanging out in the chat room for a

726
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:58,679
long time yeah man I've become a an

727
00:31:55,109 --> 00:32:02,788
addict of it man you guys are definitely

728
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:05,429
some of the best I know of right here

729
00:32:02,788 --> 00:32:13,308
this is a actually an eight one eight

730
00:32:05,429 --> 00:32:17,548
headband and it is very fuelie yes II

731
00:32:13,308 --> 00:32:20,849
need that for K how many grams youth

732
00:32:17,548 --> 00:32:27,119
you're getting up a plant of that I'm

733
00:32:20,849 --> 00:32:29,399
not sure we usually range somewhere from

734
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:33,979
three to five a plant but sometimes we

735
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:33,980
hit like seven or eight pounds

736
00:32:35,298 --> 00:32:41,908
do you prefer to drive with all the

737
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:43,919
leaves still intact yeah we just hang

738
00:32:41,909 --> 00:32:48,150
dry them like this man just like tobacco

739
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:51,179
kind of what do you guys think well I

740
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:54,090
used to kind of think that I agree with

741
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:57,330
that because I felt the plant was going

742
00:32:54,089 --> 00:32:59,459
to lose 90% of its weight water and that

743
00:32:57,329 --> 00:33:02,038
you need to do it through the leaves or

744
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:03,230
if the leaves are all gone it'll do it

745
00:33:02,038 --> 00:33:05,419
through the flowers

746
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:08,419
and for some reason I felt it was better

747
00:33:05,419 --> 00:33:10,850
to do intact leaves but I don't know

748
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:15,770
that person typically just what I

749
00:33:10,849 --> 00:33:19,599
thought my gut god did I'd probably take

750
00:33:15,769 --> 00:33:22,129
your gut over some scientific facts

751
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:25,178
actually my that's big enough that

752
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:25,179
there's enough for everybody

753
00:33:28,119 --> 00:33:33,589
go ahead I was a trimmer before I was a

754
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:37,100
grower and I definitely prefer the hang

755
00:33:33,589 --> 00:33:42,079
dried plants as far as smoke and just

756
00:33:37,099 --> 00:33:47,839
trimming it in general you trim over

757
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:50,029
screens yes sir good stuff yeah before I

758
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:52,178
had screens I was pretty much trim it

759
00:33:50,029 --> 00:33:56,808
while it's wet sort of thing just to

760
00:33:52,179 --> 00:33:59,450
know the dry sip its but now now I see

761
00:33:56,808 --> 00:34:01,250
you know it's it's it's it's all in

762
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:03,289
different gardeners it seems some some

763
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:04,640
are in favor of pulling out while it's

764
00:34:03,289 --> 00:34:07,069
wet somewhere in favor of petting it

765
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:10,220
wallets we were kind of forced to

766
00:34:07,069 --> 00:34:12,289
harvest out here we got some Frost a

767
00:34:10,219 --> 00:34:16,128
couple days ago it's like 20 degrees

768
00:34:12,289 --> 00:34:17,840
Fahrenheit and we left a few all but we

769
00:34:16,128 --> 00:34:21,648
covered them up a little bit you guys

770
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:23,940
could see that but uh it's a big sausage

771
00:34:21,648 --> 00:34:27,118
is definitely unkind to these plants

772
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:27,119
[Music]

773
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:36,379
these were really cold temperatures

774
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:39,260
speeded up and made it get frosty ER but

775
00:34:36,378 --> 00:34:40,849
almost all varieties don't like it when

776
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:46,940
it comes you just see how empty the

777
00:34:40,849 --> 00:34:48,769
garden is now so what happens is Sam so

778
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:51,349
ice crystals just form inside the water

779
00:34:48,769 --> 00:34:56,148
crystals already yeah well if that

780
00:34:51,349 --> 00:34:58,130
happens it absolutely buxom yes some

781
00:34:56,148 --> 00:35:00,618
varieties are very sensitive other

782
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:04,970
varieties are fairly resistant either

783
00:35:00,619 --> 00:35:07,760
from maybe the resistance comes from

784
00:35:04,969 --> 00:35:09,679
genetic history another two is there a

785
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,540
lot of cold weather their parents are

786
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:13,049
coming from so of things with

787
00:35:11,539 --> 00:35:15,420
Afghanistan

788
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:17,100
kind of influences wood attended have

789
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:21,180
you would think have that type of bio

790
00:35:17,099 --> 00:35:25,969
defense thanks for your mountainous but

791
00:35:21,179 --> 00:35:25,969
the bottom line is take your clothing

792
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:39,150
and that's where you learn this is some

793
00:35:31,559 --> 00:35:47,880
lavender from soma damn it's nice and

794
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:55,700
purple those cattell is true I said when

795
00:35:47,880 --> 00:36:00,269
did those go on the ground you been yeah

796
00:35:55,699 --> 00:36:01,769
when'd it does go in the ground there's

797
00:36:00,269 --> 00:36:05,670
a bit of a late start this year we

798
00:36:01,769 --> 00:36:08,759
usually get in early April but we were

799
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:10,769
instead in like early May if not mid May

800
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:13,710
out here I'm in Eastern Oregon it's

801
00:36:10,769 --> 00:36:16,679
fairly dry we usually get a longer

802
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:18,358
season than this but it got too cold too

803
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:20,309
quick and then it rained right before it

804
00:36:18,358 --> 00:36:22,619
got cold so we got a little scared no

805
00:36:20,309 --> 00:36:24,570
gonna lie lots of people were getting

806
00:36:22,619 --> 00:36:28,680
scared it was either fires burning their

807
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:30,539
plants in ground or oh man freezing

808
00:36:28,679 --> 00:36:34,799
weather coming in and freezing did you

809
00:36:30,539 --> 00:36:36,570
see Benson Elvis's garden no I didn't

810
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:39,450
know I really am feeling for sub-cooled

811
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:42,470
oh I feel real bad for him oh good I

812
00:36:39,449 --> 00:36:45,389
know so many people so many people I

813
00:36:42,469 --> 00:36:48,389
mean quite a few lives lost I think it

814
00:36:45,389 --> 00:36:50,909
was over 7,000 structures that burned to

815
00:36:48,389 --> 00:36:52,710
the ground home gosh there was a

816
00:36:50,909 --> 00:36:54,089
neighborhood in Santa Rosa where houses

817
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:55,530
would burn on one side of the street

818
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:57,930
down to the ground and on the other side

819
00:36:55,530 --> 00:37:01,200
no damage at all like it was either

820
00:36:57,929 --> 00:37:02,069
you're gone or didn't get touched that's

821
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:04,439
crazy

822
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:07,070
it really is like that's almost some

823
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:11,720
like what's that all about

824
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:14,460
terrifying absolutely that's something

825
00:37:11,719 --> 00:37:16,919
what do you do if your if your outdoor

826
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:19,800
material does succumb to frost or a

827
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:21,780
snowfall is that completely I mean you

828
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:25,289
just you whack it down but what what

829
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:26,519
does that take away from potency or what

830
00:37:25,289 --> 00:37:28,320
does it do

831
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:30,838
I'm really not sure you guys are the

832
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:33,660
scientists right are you talking about

833
00:37:30,838 --> 00:37:36,000
frozen no I'm talking about like if

834
00:37:33,659 --> 00:37:37,529
you're right just before harvest yeah

835
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,210
and you're trying to get one more day of

836
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:41,550
growth than you just try to get those

837
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:44,639
things out but you got one day and

838
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:46,220
you're lucky user comes to frost or you

839
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:50,009
know a snowfall

840
00:37:46,219 --> 00:37:53,189
does it really deleterious ly affect the

841
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:54,750
quality really maybe not the resin so

842
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:57,240
much my worry would be that it would

843
00:37:54,750 --> 00:38:00,420
potentially like the that the resin if

844
00:37:57,239 --> 00:38:03,419
it could change the color it'll change

845
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:07,530
the smell a bit tasting to taste a bit

846
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:10,230
and most people don't find those changes

847
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:14,849
favorable and if you let the planets

848
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:20,338
really freeze hard it turns it into

849
00:38:14,849 --> 00:38:23,099
black goop soup mmm yeah I've not had

850
00:38:20,338 --> 00:38:26,929
much experience with hard freezes worth

851
00:38:23,099 --> 00:38:31,588
thirty thousand feet more or less and

852
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:34,829
what but I have had a couple of harvests

853
00:38:31,588 --> 00:38:37,409
that got abundant rain-- on them before

854
00:38:34,829 --> 00:38:40,230
harvest was done and they didn't seem to

855
00:38:37,409 --> 00:38:41,549
mind it much at all put a lot of effort

856
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:44,909
into supporting the weight of the

857
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:48,150
branches before they fill in so isn't it

858
00:38:44,909 --> 00:38:52,469
amazing higher incidence of mold that

859
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:56,789
year wait no I've got a pretty good

860
00:38:52,469 --> 00:39:02,029
drying setup and we had good Sun right

861
00:38:56,789 --> 00:39:05,460
after that last year for example in

862
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:07,890
October California started getting rain

863
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:10,108
we got a lot we got over 100 inches of

864
00:39:07,889 --> 00:39:16,289
rain here after four years of drought

865
00:39:10,108 --> 00:39:18,059
and in October in about two days we got

866
00:39:16,289 --> 00:39:21,838
10 inches of rain all at once

867
00:39:18,059 --> 00:39:24,539
and we still had probably half the

868
00:39:21,838 --> 00:39:26,699
garden was still out there and we lost a

869
00:39:24,539 --> 00:39:30,329
couple of branches but for the most part

870
00:39:26,699 --> 00:39:34,819
no the the Sun came back the couple of

871
00:39:30,329 --> 00:39:39,000
days after the rain and it came on

872
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:42,840
slowly we had some cloud cover

873
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:48,090
and a nice breeze and the plants perked

874
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:50,070
right up and we had a nice finish had to

875
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:54,120
use a dehumidifier in the drying room

876
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:56,070
because the ambient humidity here with

877
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:59,400
all the rain that followed after that

878
00:39:56,070 --> 00:40:01,789
first storm yeah there was no way they

879
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:04,860
would have dried with ambient air is

880
00:40:01,789 --> 00:40:07,289
dehumidifier but the plants themselves

881
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:11,280
seem to do fine didn't see much movement

882
00:40:07,289 --> 00:40:14,159
but the colors that seemed to have be

883
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:16,380
high in CBD at least in my experience

884
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:18,960
are for the most part not very

885
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:21,960
susceptible to mold that some Sam has

886
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:24,449
talked about before and I don't know the

887
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:27,240
specifics of that or the why of it but

888
00:40:24,449 --> 00:40:29,519
it seems to be the my experience that

889
00:40:27,239 --> 00:40:31,789
they they don't really they're not real

890
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:34,170
susceptible to mold I'll say so that

891
00:40:31,789 --> 00:40:36,750
it's pretty amazing that you think that

892
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:39,630
you can make really tasty material from

893
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:43,250
fresh frozen freshly harvested material

894
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:47,160
yet if the plant is alive and is frozen

895
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:48,869
hey there must be some you know inherent

896
00:40:47,159 --> 00:40:51,210
biochemistry that happens within the

897
00:40:48,869 --> 00:40:53,159
plant to make it either susceptible to

898
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:57,119
mold or like Sam was saying make the

899
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:59,909
color change make well it different go

900
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:03,389
on is although if in a hard freeze all

901
00:40:59,909 --> 00:41:05,940
the water in that plant would expand and

902
00:41:03,389 --> 00:41:07,679
burst the cell walls of every braid of

903
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:09,269
the plant material and that's the way

904
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:12,569
he'd end up with that much Sam was

905
00:41:09,269 --> 00:41:16,860
talking about it be a big soup of

906
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:18,780
everything yes fresh frozen material

907
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:21,059
that that's happening anyway so if you

908
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:23,550
take the plant and you harvest it and

909
00:41:21,059 --> 00:41:27,509
the plant still has a decent amount of

910
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:30,360
water in it frozen process you're still

911
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:32,160
doing the same thing so I guess I was

912
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:35,579
you know kind of thinking about this in

913
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:39,119
terms of if a grower came and all sudden

914
00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:41,190
saw his grows succumbed to frost it's

915
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:43,559
like cut everything down and then just

916
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:45,570
keep it frozen and make live resin out

917
00:41:43,559 --> 00:41:47,889
of it because you've already started

918
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:52,680
that process of

919
00:41:47,889 --> 00:41:54,219
install the cell walls what can you say

920
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:58,029
me mark

921
00:41:54,219 --> 00:42:00,099
go ahead I'm just saying exactly what

922
00:41:58,030 --> 00:42:03,970
you're saying make sense to me

923
00:42:00,099 --> 00:42:07,719
wondering maybe there's some sort of

924
00:42:03,969 --> 00:42:10,629
plant defense biochemical mechanism that

925
00:42:07,719 --> 00:42:13,299
if it gets close to freezing the plant

926
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:16,930
is stressed and create some kind of

927
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:19,390
plume of whatever in the plant to give

928
00:42:16,929 --> 00:42:21,639
it you know this different flavor

929
00:42:19,389 --> 00:42:25,480
different color different so definitely

930
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:27,639
happens with animals mark depending on

931
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:30,760
how you kill an animal its flesh will

932
00:42:27,639 --> 00:42:32,230
taste very different i strolling

933
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:35,500
somebody that is like don't cut it while

934
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:37,119
it's in shock it'll taste bad yeah well

935
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:39,159
if you release adrenaline and you let

936
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:42,670
the animal know that it's dying before

937
00:42:39,159 --> 00:42:45,219
it's dying it what you do is you talk to

938
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:47,380
each plant and say it's okay baby we're

939
00:42:45,219 --> 00:42:48,629
gonna really have a lot of fun and then

940
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:51,340
you laugh

941
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:54,039
well actually what I have some [ __ ] I

942
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:56,350
tell mine when I'm taking them down is

943
00:42:54,039 --> 00:42:59,650
that they're now going through the next

944
00:42:56,349 --> 00:43:01,299
step of the process to be in service to

945
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:04,059
all the humans that are waiting for this

946
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:06,310
medicine I really do think they're

947
00:43:04,059 --> 00:43:09,670
sentient beings man and I know Sam you

948
00:43:06,309 --> 00:43:11,829
don't hold a lot of cotton to that but I

949
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:15,579
feel like they're all do every one of

950
00:43:11,829 --> 00:43:18,369
them is different and they really

951
00:43:15,579 --> 00:43:20,019
respond I don't know I used to take them

952
00:43:18,369 --> 00:43:21,909
individually when I would harvest them I

953
00:43:20,019 --> 00:43:25,420
would take them into another room so the

954
00:43:21,909 --> 00:43:28,589
other plants wouldn't see I always kind

955
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:30,820
of felt once I saw that plants do have

956
00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:34,690
being understanding and you can see

957
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:36,850
things moved around them and respond as

958
00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:38,769
I've kind of always felt that way and I

959
00:43:36,849 --> 00:43:40,690
know people think I'm crazy but you know

960
00:43:38,769 --> 00:43:42,460
it's just one of those things I've kind

961
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:46,990
of always felt about the plant as a

962
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:50,470
plant breeder through selection I can

963
00:43:46,989 --> 00:43:53,079
honestly say I've killed way more many

964
00:43:50,469 --> 00:43:57,209
plants than they've ever fully grown and

965
00:43:53,079 --> 00:43:57,210
harvested murderer

966
00:43:57,519 --> 00:44:00,599
[Music]

967
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:08,990
right you don't learn until you kill

968
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:10,550
your first 100,000 well just wanted to

969
00:44:08,989 --> 00:44:11,839
jump in for a minute and say I'm really

970
00:44:10,550 --> 00:44:14,570
glad Marc brought up the point about

971
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:16,850
harvesting frozen plant quickly and if

972
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:18,470
there's a window between when it froze

973
00:44:16,849 --> 00:44:19,969
and maybe before thaws up because I've

974
00:44:18,469 --> 00:44:21,589
been processing a lot of live presents

975
00:44:19,969 --> 00:44:23,239
so we're freezing what we get

976
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:25,190
immediately after harvest and then it

977
00:44:23,239 --> 00:44:27,349
stays frozen until it's extracted you

978
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:28,880
need to get a little bit closer to the

979
00:44:27,349 --> 00:44:31,039
mic Oh apologies

980
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:32,320
I had the same question as Marc scaled

981
00:44:31,039 --> 00:44:34,460
down there I wanted to thank you for

982
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:36,320
wondering if we could just harvest those

983
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:38,480
plants before they thought out you know

984
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:40,850
in processing isn't that absolutely if

985
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:43,429
either you harvest them before they

986
00:44:40,849 --> 00:44:46,819
freeze or if you freeze them let them

987
00:44:43,429 --> 00:44:49,579
stay frozen and process them while

988
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:50,630
they're frozen I think that is part of

989
00:44:49,579 --> 00:44:53,509
the solution

990
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:55,789
right yeah lots of people out there

991
00:44:53,510 --> 00:45:00,080
doing fresh frozen there's a few people

992
00:44:55,789 --> 00:45:16,070
doing field frozen forced field frozen

993
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:17,449
hash that's it field frozen [ __ ] I

994
00:45:16,070 --> 00:45:19,850
guess we're still waiting for Keegan to

995
00:45:17,449 --> 00:45:25,879
come in yeah then we should have a bong

996
00:45:19,849 --> 00:45:38,179
rip right there be lovers let's have a

997
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:43,640
bond rip I woke up in snow and I was

998
00:45:38,179 --> 00:45:47,329
just [ __ ] but it's gone no it's just

999
00:45:43,639 --> 00:45:49,369
not sunny in Yellowstone it was snowing

1000
00:45:47,329 --> 00:45:52,819
practically until the last couple of

1001
00:45:49,369 --> 00:45:54,319
days so I feel yeah it's if you look at

1002
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:56,240
my pictures you'll see there's snow on

1003
00:45:54,320 --> 00:46:02,960
the trees and in the ground on the

1004
00:45:56,239 --> 00:46:05,149
ground etcetera egg dry sifting time now

1005
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:06,380
well it really wasn't sticking too much

1006
00:46:05,150 --> 00:46:09,050
on the ground it just made a little

1007
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:11,390
slick out on the roads etc etc you know

1008
00:46:09,050 --> 00:46:12,890
I've went to college in West Virginia so

1009
00:46:11,389 --> 00:46:14,239
I learned how to drive in the snow so it

1010
00:46:12,889 --> 00:46:17,559
wasn't so

1011
00:46:14,239 --> 00:46:20,419
but you know yeah unfortunately my mom

1012
00:46:17,559 --> 00:46:23,389
ran herself off the road in a Subaru and

1013
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:26,000
had to get pulled out and no on my way

1014
00:46:23,389 --> 00:46:27,588
to see your literally first thing we go

1015
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:32,260
to the rental place to meet her and then

1016
00:46:27,588 --> 00:46:32,259
we get a call from her and off the road

1017
00:46:32,889 --> 00:46:39,529
she just went just a couple of feet just

1018
00:46:35,869 --> 00:46:40,940
into the snow just off the road and they

1019
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:42,890
were able to triple-a was able to come

1020
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:44,750
out she was in the Grand Tetons so they

1021
00:46:42,889 --> 00:46:48,259
were able to come in she was just like a

1022
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:50,630
quarter-mile passive and pull her out it

1023
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:53,869
just took a little time in the wind it

1024
00:46:50,630 --> 00:46:55,970
was it was they was snowing the whole

1025
00:46:53,869 --> 00:46:57,470
time so in my mom's I've never known her

1026
00:46:55,969 --> 00:47:00,588
to drive in snow remember she's from

1027
00:46:57,469 --> 00:47:03,848
Louisiana lives in in Texas so I had no

1028
00:47:00,588 --> 00:47:07,099
idea necessarily how to give spacing and

1029
00:47:03,849 --> 00:47:09,380
yeah it just happens unfortunately she

1030
00:47:07,099 --> 00:47:10,670
was fine everything's good but remember

1031
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:12,920
people when you're driving in the snow

1032
00:47:10,670 --> 00:47:16,220
give people a couple of car lengths

1033
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:18,619
space in between so that snow is slick

1034
00:47:16,219 --> 00:47:22,909
and hit your brakes

1035
00:47:18,619 --> 00:47:25,338
Canadian friends can agree yeah it's a

1036
00:47:22,909 --> 00:47:29,268
lot of fun a lot of fun in the snow if

1037
00:47:25,338 --> 00:47:32,239
you're applying it properly parking lots

1038
00:47:29,268 --> 00:47:33,258
empty with full snow as falls in him or

1039
00:47:32,239 --> 00:47:36,459
[ __ ] great

1040
00:47:33,259 --> 00:47:43,400
oh go and play last I'm going doing it

1041
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:45,798
yeah yeah then we've got the back of the

1042
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:49,849
the bumpers and toboggans on the end of

1043
00:47:45,798 --> 00:47:53,150
those 30 feet and just do do laps and

1044
00:47:49,849 --> 00:47:57,380
donuts until they fell off right we did

1045
00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:59,329
that we did that Louisiana with three

1046
00:47:57,380 --> 00:48:01,369
wheelers and mud we'd get like a four by

1047
00:47:59,329 --> 00:48:04,099
eight and get a ski rope and then just

1048
00:48:01,369 --> 00:48:06,798
get pulled behind yeah entertainment you

1049
00:48:04,099 --> 00:48:09,740
need to do car hood works good behind

1050
00:48:06,798 --> 00:48:12,949
the vehicle in the snow too Oh long

1051
00:48:09,739 --> 00:48:14,538
there two watts oh yeah turn it upside

1052
00:48:12,949 --> 00:48:18,679
down there and get the slick side oh I

1053
00:48:14,539 --> 00:48:22,970
bet some handles on it even right on the

1054
00:48:18,679 --> 00:48:24,739
front you can just give her we had some

1055
00:48:22,969 --> 00:48:28,548
fun up here in the in the younger days

1056
00:48:24,739 --> 00:48:30,769
of the snowfalls that's for sure I still

1057
00:48:28,548 --> 00:48:32,690
take my truck off-road with my sled in

1058
00:48:30,768 --> 00:48:35,358
the back drive up the mountain up a

1059
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:38,568
shady wintery road into the backcountry

1060
00:48:35,358 --> 00:48:40,848
and then get the sled off and then go as

1061
00:48:38,568 --> 00:48:41,568
far in as you can go before you're gonna

1062
00:48:40,849 --> 00:48:44,599
run out of gas

1063
00:48:41,568 --> 00:48:46,880
on the way back you can literally just

1064
00:48:44,599 --> 00:48:48,318
keep on going a mark for through those

1065
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:50,480
mountains in the back of your place

1066
00:48:48,318 --> 00:48:54,139
there oh yeah you could tell you ran out

1067
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:56,568
of gas and you were you know get a

1068
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:59,808
helicopter drop for fuel and keep on

1069
00:48:56,568 --> 00:49:02,690
going if I had a helicopter I think I'd

1070
00:48:59,809 --> 00:49:04,249
just be in it I'm like you know what

1071
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:13,338
let's just leave the sled no need the

1072
00:49:04,248 --> 00:49:16,129
snow let's leave the sled you know they

1073
00:49:13,338 --> 00:49:18,139
do that sometimes fly with the sled

1074
00:49:16,130 --> 00:49:20,088
hanging underneath so they can drop the

1075
00:49:18,139 --> 00:49:22,190
sled first and then the people there you

1076
00:49:20,088 --> 00:49:24,048
go there's your sled you nice to have a

1077
00:49:22,190 --> 00:49:28,579
sled I've not heard of heli sledding

1078
00:49:24,048 --> 00:49:30,400
before it's no it's a real thing a real

1079
00:49:28,579 --> 00:49:32,600
thing

1080
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:35,780
some of these guys are hot when they

1081
00:49:32,599 --> 00:49:38,659
drop them hey Cuban what are you gonna

1082
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:40,960
do with those plants you got there you

1083
00:49:38,659 --> 00:49:51,279
hashing them

1084
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:55,970
he's muted he's muted suppose he's yeah

1085
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:58,220
those plants are you back yeah man yeah

1086
00:49:55,969 --> 00:50:00,949
I definitely I use hash for my own use

1087
00:49:58,219 --> 00:50:04,118
but uh we take care of each every six

1088
00:50:00,949 --> 00:50:06,500
plants represents a patient in here and

1089
00:50:04,119 --> 00:50:08,059
we basically just provide them the

1090
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:15,050
medicine they need for the year man and

1091
00:50:08,059 --> 00:50:16,519
whatever form they need nice okay now I

1092
00:50:15,050 --> 00:50:18,289
want to explain this to you guys I live

1093
00:50:16,519 --> 00:50:20,358
in this county and you know Oregon's

1094
00:50:18,289 --> 00:50:22,699
legal everything I live in this county

1095
00:50:20,358 --> 00:50:25,639
that's as far east as possible and

1096
00:50:22,699 --> 00:50:28,250
they're close to a Republican state so

1097
00:50:25,639 --> 00:50:29,868
they opted out of the legalization and

1098
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:33,980
all the money from the state and things

1099
00:50:29,869 --> 00:50:36,559
like that so basically all we can do in

1100
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:39,199
this county is uh we are allowed to grow

1101
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:42,469
our medical out of City Limits we can

1102
00:50:39,199 --> 00:50:48,230
have a you know more than 12 plants if

1103
00:50:42,469 --> 00:50:49,969
we live out of City Limits so it's kind

1104
00:50:48,230 --> 00:50:53,349
of a conundrum over here for people that

1105
00:50:49,969 --> 00:50:59,809
need the stuff you know there's not any

1106
00:50:53,349 --> 00:51:02,029
outlet what is that like six plants is

1107
00:50:59,809 --> 00:51:08,329
one patient and you said you can get

1108
00:51:02,030 --> 00:51:13,510
five pounds off a plan it's possible 30

1109
00:51:08,329 --> 00:51:17,269
pounds per fish that's a good amount

1110
00:51:13,510 --> 00:51:20,660
they do pretty well they just they

1111
00:51:17,269 --> 00:51:23,389
allowed us to they took us medical guys

1112
00:51:20,659 --> 00:51:26,059
out of the equation pretty much with all

1113
00:51:23,389 --> 00:51:28,309
the REC growing everything's through the

1114
00:51:26,059 --> 00:51:30,349
Liquor Commission but uh now they're

1115
00:51:28,309 --> 00:51:34,309
allowing us small growers or you know us

1116
00:51:30,349 --> 00:51:36,049
small handed medical guys to get rid of

1117
00:51:34,309 --> 00:51:38,299
a little bit of stuff on the legal

1118
00:51:36,050 --> 00:51:40,068
market to at least cover our costs and

1119
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:42,759
things like that so

1120
00:51:40,068 --> 00:51:48,199
you know at least they gave us a chance

1121
00:51:42,759 --> 00:51:50,869
yeah yeah that's a start yeah organs not

1122
00:51:48,199 --> 00:51:52,369
be bad that's a way better situation in

1123
00:51:50,869 --> 00:51:57,410
Washington they pretty much killed off

1124
00:51:52,369 --> 00:52:00,759
medical and is no crossing yeah back 15

1125
00:51:57,409 --> 00:52:05,208
years and nobody had nothing nothing

1126
00:52:00,759 --> 00:52:06,889
what we did it anyway right yeah it's so

1127
00:52:05,208 --> 00:52:08,748
much nicer to have you have to admit

1128
00:52:06,889 --> 00:52:11,208
like for your family and for your loved

1129
00:52:08,748 --> 00:52:13,218
ones like it's so much nicer to be able

1130
00:52:11,208 --> 00:52:14,868
to grow cannabis and help people without

1131
00:52:13,219 --> 00:52:17,108
the worry of having your door kicked

1132
00:52:14,869 --> 00:52:21,229
down and your livelihood taken your life

1133
00:52:17,108 --> 00:52:23,808
stolen and jailed like Zak we really

1134
00:52:21,228 --> 00:52:25,608
should sort of give props more often as

1135
00:52:23,809 --> 00:52:27,890
we're constantly criticizing of course

1136

I give many thanks every day I have a

1156
00:53:17,989 --> 00:53:21,499
career thanks to the law change that

1157
00:53:19,699 --> 00:53:23,449
happened in Washington so I'm happy to

1158
00:53:21,498 --> 00:53:25,098
be a part of the i-502 system nothing's

1159
00:53:23,449 --> 00:53:28,028
perfect but we keep moving forwards and

1160
00:53:25,099 --> 00:53:28,028
that's how we got to where we are today

1161
00:53:28,150 --> 00:53:32,660
you know you'd start off with the forms

1162
00:53:30,829 --> 00:53:35,959
they have you want as the survey they

1163
00:53:32,659 --> 00:53:37,998
they want to fill out in BC mark I mean

1164
00:53:35,958 --> 00:53:40,368
have you seen any of that the form that

1165
00:53:37,998 --> 00:53:41,899
they want to have our opinion on I fill

1166
00:53:40,369 --> 00:53:48,079
that out a long time ago a couple weeks

1167
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:49,969
ago remind people you know maybe put the

1168
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:52,789
link up or something I don't know to

1169
00:53:49,969 --> 00:53:55,659
what I think it's I might be over it

1170
00:53:52,789 --> 00:53:55,660
might not be but it's

1171
00:53:56,280 --> 00:54:05,280
well first 20,000 from BC I knew that

1172
00:54:00,809 --> 00:54:07,980
much yeah it basically is how do you

1173
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:11,280
want the situation to go you know which

1174
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:15,179
is good yeah I did a couple of those now

1175
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:17,220
for the ACM PR as well they had one of

1176
00:54:15,179 --> 00:54:19,169
those so what is currently happening

1177
00:54:17,219 --> 00:54:21,209
there in Canada I mean I hear of

1178
00:54:19,170 --> 00:54:22,769
different cities or doing different

1179
00:54:21,210 --> 00:54:26,699
things either allowing or not allowing

1180
00:54:22,769 --> 00:54:28,469
or well federally there's gonna be

1181
00:54:26,699 --> 00:54:32,099
federal law which right now we have a

1182
00:54:28,469 --> 00:54:37,139
federal cannabis medical system in place

1183
00:54:32,099 --> 00:54:40,500
called the ACM PR and the ACM PR is both

1184
00:54:37,139 --> 00:54:43,769
for patients and for companies so I can

1185
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:47,190
get an ACM PR license and I can grow and

1186
00:54:43,769 --> 00:54:49,860
use my own cannabis these companies can

1187
00:54:47,190 --> 00:54:51,659
get a special ACN PR it's called an LP

1188
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:54,780
license and then they can grow and

1189
00:54:51,659 --> 00:54:56,429
distribute cannabis to patients and so

1190
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:58,019
that's that's the that's the thing

1191
00:54:56,429 --> 00:54:59,730
that's in place right now for medical

1192
00:54:58,019 --> 00:55:01,469
and it's constantly like oh we need to

1193
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:02,670
get concentrates a bigger part of it

1194
00:55:01,469 --> 00:55:04,799
because they only allow us a very

1195
00:55:02,670 --> 00:55:08,010
diluted oil they don't allow edibles in

1196
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:10,110
the legal in the in the business aspect

1197
00:55:08,010 --> 00:55:12,120
if you have an ACM PR yourself you can

1198
00:55:10,110 --> 00:55:13,910
use all forms of extracts you can do

1199
00:55:12,119 --> 00:55:16,259
anything that you want with the plant

1200
00:55:13,909 --> 00:55:18,119
it's only these companies that are

1201
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:20,040
limited to being able to sell these

1202
00:55:18,119 --> 00:55:23,299
products which obviously puts a huge

1203
00:55:20,039 --> 00:55:26,039
hindrance on on the business of of

1204
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:28,980
cannabis and cannabis medicine if you

1205
00:55:26,039 --> 00:55:32,130
can't sell like 90 percent of what the

1206
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:33,869
products are then it creates the black

1207
00:55:32,130 --> 00:55:36,210
market or what I call the civil

1208
00:55:33,869 --> 00:55:37,739
disobedience market which is the market

1209
00:55:36,210 --> 00:55:39,030
that got us into the place that we are

1210
00:55:37,739 --> 00:55:40,979
right now so you go is going to give

1211
00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:43,140
props to that the dispensaries Hillary

1212
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:45,539
starting the compassion club and all

1213
00:55:43,139 --> 00:55:47,879
these others that followed our civil

1214
00:55:45,539 --> 00:55:50,429
disobedience and that's they're there

1215
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:52,559
because the LPS aren't legally allowed

1216
00:55:50,429 --> 00:55:55,529
to sell all of these great products

1217
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:59,460
edibles and shatters and bubbles and all

1218
00:55:55,530 --> 00:56:02,460
these things and so it causes it causes

1219
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:03,990
dispensaries to have to exist for for

1220
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:04,789
patients otherwise patients don't have

1221
00:56:03,989 --> 00:56:08,099
access to it

1222
00:56:04,789 --> 00:56:10,199
then there's recreational which is

1223
00:56:08,099 --> 00:56:12,599
supposed to be in by July of 2018 and

1224
00:56:10,199 --> 00:56:14,339
that is mostly what you're talking about

1225
00:56:12,599 --> 00:56:18,059
right now with provinces because the

1226
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:20,070
federal cannabis is the same in every

1227
00:56:18,059 --> 00:56:21,210
province the provinces can figure out

1228
00:56:20,070 --> 00:56:24,600
how they want to distribute it

1229
00:56:21,210 --> 00:56:28,079
eventually but right now it's MMAR or

1230
00:56:24,599 --> 00:56:30,449
ACM PR is all the same and MMAR is the

1231
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:33,210
one that preceded the ACM PR it was

1232
00:56:30,449 --> 00:56:35,009
prior it was before and I'm a part of

1233
00:56:33,210 --> 00:56:36,570
the MMAR that was the one that we did

1234
00:56:35,010 --> 00:56:38,190
the lawsuit and we went against our

1235
00:56:36,570 --> 00:56:40,769
government and said no like this is all

1236
00:56:38,190 --> 00:56:42,869
breaking the Charter of Rights of you

1237
00:56:40,769 --> 00:56:45,360
can't have it be like this and we won

1238
00:56:42,869 --> 00:56:48,179
thanks to Creek to saw and John Conroy

1239
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:49,500
and Jason Wilcox and Johnny B and Remo

1240
00:56:48,179 --> 00:56:51,839
and all these people that were a big

1241
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:54,630
part of the coalition they made it so we

1242
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:56,730
could continue to grow and so with with

1243
00:56:54,630 --> 00:56:58,680
recreation coming in it's the for plant

1244
00:56:56,730 --> 00:57:00,750
thing each province is gonna figure out

1245
00:56:58,679 --> 00:57:02,879
how they want to do it Ontario came out

1246
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:04,619
and said they wanted to open a hundred

1247
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:05,880
and fifty stores or something over the

1248
00:57:04,619 --> 00:57:08,519
course of the next five years and

1249
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:10,829
everyone lost their [ __ ] no matter how

1250
00:57:08,519 --> 00:57:12,539
it happens everyone's gonna continue to

1251
00:57:10,829 --> 00:57:14,730
lose their [ __ ] I can't imagine them

1252
00:57:12,539 --> 00:57:17,610
ever doing it the way we actually want

1253
00:57:14,730 --> 00:57:20,340
but I do see it going slowly but surely

1254
00:57:17,610 --> 00:57:22,710
like us just chiseling away at the parts

1255
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:24,960
we don't want until it gets to be you

1256
00:57:22,710 --> 00:57:27,750
know something that's that's that we can

1257
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:29,369
stand behind what you're doing with

1258
00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:31,170
these surveys that you and Dee are

1259
00:57:29,369 --> 00:57:32,849
talking about are those sent out to you

1260
00:57:31,170 --> 00:57:35,760
by the government or these sent out by

1261
00:57:32,849 --> 00:57:37,920
region you can go online and fill them

1262
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:39,630
out they're on the Health Canada website

1263
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:41,220
I don't know the link but if Dee knows

1264
00:57:39,630 --> 00:57:46,559
that he can put it up in the hash church

1265
00:57:41,219 --> 00:57:47,789
group in Facebook and what you've

1266
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:49,889
presented cuz it sounds like you've

1267
00:57:47,789 --> 00:57:52,019
helped it's shaped not perfectly but

1268
00:57:49,889 --> 00:57:55,289
you've you'll have been able to you know

1269
00:57:52,019 --> 00:57:57,420
manipulate the shaping of how things are

1270
00:57:55,289 --> 00:57:59,940
to an extent not fully but to an extent

1271
00:57:57,420 --> 00:58:01,260
yeah yeah exactly well at least everyone

1272
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:04,619
can have their voice and it's in every

1273
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:06,270
province so that's gonna be like I'm

1274
00:58:04,619 --> 00:58:07,799
sure it'll be like a hundred thousand

1275
00:58:06,269 --> 00:58:11,130
plus or maybe two hundred thousand

1276
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:12,900
people might end up offering good

1277
00:58:11,130 --> 00:58:15,059
opinions so hopefully they have the

1278
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:17,730
people that can go through and listen to

1279
00:58:15,059 --> 00:58:18,480
those opinions and actually you know

1280
00:58:17,730 --> 00:58:20,250
you'd hope that

1281
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:22,349
would use some of those opinions

1282
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:24,539
particularly ones that reoccur over and

1283
00:58:22,349 --> 00:58:27,779
over and over again but you have legal

1284
00:58:24,539 --> 00:58:30,900
mail order cannabis correct such as too

1285
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:33,530
late that's the fitment only cannabis

1286
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:36,389
and a very diluted kind of olive oil and

1287
00:58:33,530 --> 00:58:38,640
how long does it take this such a high

1288
00:58:36,389 --> 00:58:40,440
place in order for that and how long

1289
00:58:38,639 --> 00:58:42,869
would that take you can have it done

1290
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:44,250
immediately oh yeah Wow my friend was

1291
00:58:42,869 --> 00:58:45,839
tripping on it when it first happened

1292
00:58:44,250 --> 00:58:48,119
he's like dude he was ordering from

1293
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:49,470
tilray and he was like and he was in

1294
00:58:48,119 --> 00:58:51,059

1312
00:59:35,579 --> 00:59:39,319

1313
00:59:37,019 --> 00:59:44,670
of these people that lost everything

1314

show some support after what they've

1318
00:59:49,619 --> 00:59:54,449
been through and I know that they've got

1319
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:56,159
some things set up with guys down there

1320
00:59:54,449 --> 00:59:57,359
on the field helping farmers which is

1321
00:59:56,159 --> 00:59:59,519
great and I can look up some of those

1322
00:59:57,360 --> 01:00:02,280
links and I know the California Growers

1323
00:59:59,519 --> 01:00:04,800
Association is doing the same thing as

1324
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:06,690
far as raising specifically for farmers

1325
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:08,340
and helping them and we can definitely

1326
01:00:06,690 --> 01:00:10,800
provide some of those links before we go

1327
01:00:08,340 --> 01:00:13,050
today but it's been it's been crazy

1328
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:16,680
it was crazy we were evacuated at 4:00

1329
01:00:13,050 --> 01:00:18,060
in the morning on Monday and you know he

1330
01:00:16,679 --> 01:00:19,649
just kind of don't believe it when it

1331
01:00:18,059 --> 01:00:23,880
happens right yeah I'm sure we're fine

1332
01:00:19,650 --> 01:00:25,559
you know fast yeah it happens quick

1333
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:27,599
those winds it was the winds you know

1334
01:00:25,559 --> 01:00:29,670
everyone's talking about the fire but

1335
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:31,889
what really caused the emergency was it

1336
01:00:29,670 --> 01:00:33,960
was there was a wind like I had never

1337
01:00:31,889 --> 01:00:35,998
experience like fifty miles an hour I

1338
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:38,699
heard that was insane it was insane so

1339
01:00:35,998 --> 01:00:40,469
it wasn't just that the fire started you

1340
01:00:38,699 --> 01:00:42,629
know likely because of you know drop

1341
01:00:40,469 --> 01:00:46,439
down powerlines but then they spread

1342
01:00:42,630 --> 01:00:48,989
quick and we're moving fast huge yeah it

1343
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:50,700
was it was crazy so yeah I went out in

1344
01:00:48,989 --> 01:00:52,980
my driveway and looked down the road and

1345
01:00:50,699 --> 01:00:56,548
there's the fire you know it's it's

1346
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:58,798
coming so it's hard it ended Arthur you

1347
01:00:56,548 --> 01:01:01,380
know I look back on it and these things

1348
01:00:58,798 --> 01:01:06,079
are minor we got to come home a few days

1349
01:01:01,380 --> 01:01:08,568
later excuse me we got to keep our house

1350
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:11,220
you know it just feel really fortunate

1351
01:01:08,568 --> 01:01:13,588
but yeah it was it was a challenge it

1352
01:01:11,219 --> 01:01:16,169
ended Silas's 38 days seizures free

1353
01:01:13,588 --> 01:01:18,599
streak which kind of sucked the stress

1354
01:01:16,170 --> 01:01:20,519
of the whole thing he started season

1355
01:01:18,599 --> 01:01:22,318
just that afternoon which you know

1356
01:01:20,518 --> 01:01:24,629
there's just medically fragile kids

1357
01:01:22,318 --> 01:01:28,498
don't do well to adventure and

1358
01:01:24,630 --> 01:01:31,410
excitement and change but you know I can

1359
01:01:28,498 --> 01:01:34,409
we look back at the farmers that we know

1360
01:01:31,409 --> 01:01:38,068
just in our area that lost their farms

1361
01:01:34,409 --> 01:01:39,719
and for me it just really puts me on

1362
01:01:38,068 --> 01:01:41,880
another soapbox which I didn't want to

1363
01:01:39,719 --> 01:01:44,219
come in here and jump on and take over

1364
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:46,230
the conversation but it's just it's just

1365
01:01:44,219 --> 01:01:49,288
another there's an injustice there

1366
01:01:46,230 --> 01:01:52,469
that's not being talked about that

1367
01:01:49,289 --> 01:01:55,019
really bothers me which is these farmers

1368
01:01:52,469 --> 01:01:56,399
are not allowed to prepare for events

1369
01:01:55,018 --> 01:01:58,199
like this you know they're not allowed

1370
01:01:56,400 --> 01:02:01,139
to get the right insurance they're not

1371
01:01:58,199 --> 01:02:04,018
allowed to insure the crops that they're

1372
01:02:01,139 --> 01:02:07,440
producing they're not allowed to bank so

1373
01:02:04,018 --> 01:02:09,659
a lot of them have ridiculous amounts of

1374
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:13,289
cash on hand and when fires like this

1375
01:02:09,659 --> 01:02:15,118
sweep through but you devastate those

1376
01:02:13,289 --> 01:02:17,880
families you know a lot of them they

1377
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:21,150
lose the cash they have on hand because

1378
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:23,309
there's no time to save anything when

1379
01:02:21,150 --> 01:02:26,130
the fires come in at 50 or 60 miles an

1380
01:02:23,309 --> 01:02:28,349
hour they lose their entire farm and

1381
01:02:26,130 --> 01:02:31,829
they live in season to season and you

1382
01:02:28,349 --> 01:02:34,710
know it's just it's hard to watch these

1383
01:02:31,829 --> 01:02:37,230
peoples really lose everything be

1384
01:02:34,710 --> 01:02:38,730
demonized throughout the year you know I

1385
01:02:37,230 --> 01:02:40,289
know they're doing amazing work because

1386
01:02:38,730 --> 01:02:42,449
some of them are they're amazing people

1387
01:02:40,289 --> 01:02:44,519
who contribute to helping save kids

1388
01:02:42,449 --> 01:02:45,439
lives through our organization and then

1389
01:02:44,518 --> 01:02:46,909
they have to lose ever

1390
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:49,639
thing and no one really cares because

1391
01:02:46,909 --> 01:02:51,588
they're just you know pot growers and I

1392
01:02:49,639 --> 01:02:53,539
just you know we have a lot of growing

1393
01:02:51,588 --> 01:02:56,690
up to do in this country and my heart

1394
01:02:53,539 --> 01:02:58,190
breaks for all those families so really

1395
01:02:56,690 --> 01:03:00,710
really glad someone's trying to target

1396
01:02:58,190 --> 01:03:02,358
those families specifically but I think

1397
01:03:00,710 --> 01:03:04,990
there's a lot more we need to do because

1398
01:03:02,358 --> 01:03:07,098
it's not just that they lose this year's

1399
01:03:04,989 --> 01:03:09,049
crop it's that they're not allowed to

1400
01:03:07,099 --> 01:03:11,059
prepare in any way like a normal

1401
01:03:09,050 --> 01:03:14,810
responsible adult would if they were

1402
01:03:11,059 --> 01:03:16,159
treated with respect and dignity so my

1403
01:03:14,809 --> 01:03:17,750
heart goes out to all those people who

1404
01:03:16,159 --> 01:03:19,670
are going through that right now and I

1405
01:03:17,750 --> 01:03:22,099
will definitely be doing anything I can

1406
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:26,450
to not only help them get through this

1407
01:03:22,099 --> 01:03:28,430
but like I like to do show it to the

1408
01:03:26,449 --> 01:03:30,739
people in the people's faces how they

1409
01:03:28,429 --> 01:03:34,250
put them in this horrible position for

1410
01:03:30,739 --> 01:03:36,500
no real justifiable reason and it's in

1411
01:03:34,250 --> 01:03:39,980
it compounds the problem it makes it

1412
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:43,579
even worse so yeah it's it's it's a

1413
01:03:39,980 --> 01:03:47,000
heartbreaker well not only that how many

1414
01:03:43,579 --> 01:03:49,550
people have invested in the farms to get

1415
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:53,300
ready to play in the legal field a lot

1416
01:03:49,550 --> 01:03:55,339
of people lost their reality to play in

1417
01:03:53,300 --> 01:03:57,250
the reality because as you said it's you

1418
01:03:55,338 --> 01:04:00,078
know it's either Bank of the earth or

1419
01:03:57,250 --> 01:04:02,769
you know cuz Eric no banks we can't go

1420
01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:05,930
to banks we've been treated absolutely

1421
01:04:02,769 --> 01:04:09,588
absurdly for the good that we have done

1422
01:04:05,929 --> 01:04:12,019
for generations now and for people to be

1423
01:04:09,588 --> 01:04:15,739
forced to suffer through that is

1424
01:04:12,019 --> 01:04:17,809
absolutely horrible to say the least

1425
01:04:15,739 --> 01:04:19,250
ya know that's a great point and I and I

1426
01:04:17,809 --> 01:04:21,108
forgot to mention it that's that's why

1427
01:04:19,250 --> 01:04:23,088
so many of them have nothing at this

1428
01:04:21,108 --> 01:04:24,469
point because they've invested

1429
01:04:23,088 --> 01:04:26,568
everything they've saved in the

1430
01:04:24,469 --> 01:04:29,719
preparing for this legal market and in

1431
01:04:26,568 --> 01:04:32,358
Nevada County where I spent a lot of

1432
01:04:29,719 --> 01:04:33,889
time it's even worse because you know

1433
01:04:32,358 --> 01:04:36,348
they've been strung along for so many

1434
01:04:33,889 --> 01:04:38,210
years now the ordinances have changed

1435
01:04:36,349 --> 01:04:39,619
they've invested thousands of dollars in

1436
01:04:38,210 --> 01:04:41,389
greenhouses that they are no longer

1437
01:04:39,619 --> 01:04:42,380
really appropriate or not legal through

1438
01:04:41,389 --> 01:04:44,269
the ordinance so they've just been

1439
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:46,910
strung along it's an all this money

1440
01:04:44,269 --> 01:04:48,469
trying to do the right thing and then it

1441
01:04:46,909 --> 01:04:51,710
just they lose everything in the fire

1442
01:04:48,469 --> 01:04:55,639
and it's just yeah or goes out jumps I

1443
01:04:51,710 --> 01:04:58,849
hope everybody here Forest sorry to

1444
01:04:55,639 --> 01:05:01,099
interrupt its raid here in

1445
01:04:58,849 --> 01:05:04,759
vadik county we've had three different

1446
01:05:01,099 --> 01:05:07,549
sets of laws about cannabis cultivation

1447
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:10,040
in the last five years all with

1448
01:05:07,550 --> 01:05:11,600
different specific requirements about if

1449
01:05:10,039 --> 01:05:14,000
you want to have a garden it's got to be

1450
01:05:11,599 --> 01:05:16,279
this or that and that and all kinds of

1451
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:18,920
people have put money into trying to

1452
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:22,460
comply with the law and yeah more than a

1453
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:26,840
few like Boris just said lost everything

1454
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:29,119
that they put into it it's done a real

1455
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:30,950
selfish personal note here own and to

1456
01:05:29,119 --> 01:05:34,099
jump in before we shifted gears away

1457
01:05:30,949 --> 01:05:36,379
from the topic of the fire after I

1458
01:05:34,099 --> 01:05:38,239
parted ways with up tech I found work

1459
01:05:36,380 --> 01:05:41,059
last fall down in Northern California as

1460
01:05:38,239 --> 01:05:42,949
a trimming in harvester and hasher and I

1461
01:05:41,059 --> 01:05:44,179
got to work for a guy who is a manager

1462
01:05:42,949 --> 01:05:47,119
at compassionate heart there in Ukiah

1463
01:05:44,179 --> 01:05:49,250
Chad Emery who had a you know 25 plant

1464
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:50,809
grow at his property and he let me live

1465
01:05:49,250 --> 01:05:52,670
there for two months while I worked for

1466
01:05:50,809 --> 01:05:55,099
him and made me part of his family he

1467
01:05:52,670 --> 01:05:56,960
loaned me his STI so I could take a rip

1468
01:05:55,099 --> 01:05:59,199
up to Humble and meet up with the dry

1469
01:05:56,960 --> 01:06:01,579
sif Jedi and learn how to make rice if -

1470
01:05:59,199 --> 01:06:02,899
super generous guy one of the most that

1471
01:06:01,579 --> 01:06:04,400
I've you know how the opportunity to

1472
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:06,470
work within the cannabis industry and

1473
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:08,510
the fire came in fast at his property

1474
01:06:06,469 --> 01:06:10,039
and he lost everything his house burned

1475
01:06:08,510 --> 01:06:12,590
to the ground his platform to the ground

1476
01:06:10,039 --> 01:06:15,529
his su STI that he lent me was roasted

1477
01:06:12,590 --> 01:06:17,600
in his driveway and he's reached out for

1478
01:06:15,530 --> 01:06:19,130
some help and he's gone I wanted to give

1479
01:06:17,599 --> 01:06:20,690
a lot of thanks to the soil King who

1480
01:06:19,130 --> 01:06:22,579
seems to be linking up a lot of people

1481
01:06:20,690 --> 01:06:24,590
in the area and has helped Chad get into

1482
01:06:22,579 --> 01:06:25,909
apartment and people have donated him

1483
01:06:24,590 --> 01:06:28,010
furniture and clothing

1484
01:06:25,909 --> 01:06:29,569
and I just wanted to say thank you for

1485
01:06:28,010 --> 01:06:31,130
that I was helping down there and make

1486
01:06:29,570 --> 01:06:33,380
any huge difference to those who need it

1487
01:06:31,130 --> 01:06:35,869
yeah I talked to the soil King was on

1488
01:06:33,380 --> 01:06:38,930
the show last night what he's doing is

1489
01:06:35,869 --> 01:06:41,179
incredible so so I'm hooked up with him

1490
01:06:38,929 --> 01:06:44,089
those who can I'll see if I can look up

1491
01:06:41,179 --> 01:06:46,309
the links but he said he's got enough

1492
01:06:44,090 --> 01:06:51,019
clothes he's got rooms full of clothes

1493
01:06:46,309 --> 01:06:53,869
but you know it's it's really - for the

1494
01:06:51,019 --> 01:06:55,940
people who are watching it's and in from

1495
01:06:53,869 --> 01:06:57,159
being someone who's needed help from

1496
01:06:55,940 --> 01:07:00,440
time to time due to circumstances

1497
01:06:57,159 --> 01:07:03,529
outside of my control there's always a

1498
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:04,970
rush in the first week right and

1499
01:07:03,530 --> 01:07:06,769
everyone says hey can I help and

1500
01:07:04,969 --> 01:07:08,509
sometimes so many people are asking that

1501
01:07:06,769 --> 01:07:10,579
it's a time the people are in shock now

1502
01:07:08,510 --> 01:07:11,589
I don't know I think we got what we need

1503
01:07:10,579 --> 01:07:14,920
or

1504
01:07:11,588 --> 01:07:16,989
now we're okay but really if you really

1505
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:19,869
want to help its remembering to ask in

1506
01:07:16,989 --> 01:07:22,568
two weeks in again in four weeks and

1507
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:25,390
again in six weeks and really try to

1508
01:07:22,568 --> 01:07:29,079
come back this attention span issue we

1509
01:07:25,389 --> 01:07:30,969
seem to have in 2017 where we're just on

1510
01:07:29,079 --> 01:07:32,890
to the next emergency or here in the

1511
01:07:30,969 --> 01:07:34,539
states like Trump will pick us but on

1512
01:07:32,889 --> 01:07:36,400
camera I never want to talk about that

1513
01:07:34,539 --> 01:07:37,989
for two months and you know we got to

1514
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:40,180
just look out for those distracting

1515
01:07:37,989 --> 01:07:41,969
things and really remember to continue

1516
01:07:40,179 --> 01:07:44,318
to check in with these people because

1517
01:07:41,969 --> 01:07:47,289
when you lose everything like that yeah

1518
01:07:44,318 --> 01:07:49,440
you might be okay today because you're

1519
01:07:47,289 --> 01:07:51,430
just you've got a pile of new clothes or

1520
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:52,809
donated clothes and you have a nice

1521
01:07:51,429 --> 01:07:55,268
chest its fullest right yeah I think

1522
01:07:52,809 --> 01:07:56,410
okay I'm that I'm a right and I'm I'm in

1523
01:07:55,268 --> 01:07:58,889
shock and I don't really know what I

1524
01:07:56,409 --> 01:08:01,659
could ask for but it's the long-term

1525
01:07:58,889 --> 01:08:03,909
follow-through so for anyone listening

1526
01:08:01,659 --> 01:08:06,129
out there or Marcus if you'd want to I

1527
01:08:03,909 --> 01:08:07,690
mean I think if we really want to help

1528
01:08:06,130 --> 01:08:09,130
again because right now there's this

1529
01:08:07,690 --> 01:08:12,338
flood and we need to continue helping

1530
01:08:09,130 --> 01:08:13,930
but in another six weeks we could do a

1531
01:08:12,338 --> 01:08:16,088
lot of good by coming back and just

1532
01:08:13,929 --> 01:08:19,420
saying we haven't forgotten and seeing

1533
01:08:16,088 --> 01:08:21,759
what we could do for those folks and Ray

1534
01:08:19,420 --> 01:08:23,319
that's the money or donations once they

1535
01:08:21,759 --> 01:08:25,210
have time to breathe and look around and

1536
01:08:23,319 --> 01:08:28,420
say okay what could we really use you

1537
01:08:25,210 --> 01:08:31,270
know yeah absolutely I think that's a

1538
01:08:28,420 --> 01:08:34,270
great idea as always Forrest I'll

1539
01:08:31,270 --> 01:08:36,369
support that and hey did you want to

1540
01:08:34,270 --> 01:08:37,659
introduce your friend that just got into

1541
01:08:36,368 --> 01:08:40,329
the room yeah I want to welcome

1542
01:08:37,658 --> 01:08:45,278
Keegan O'Neal to hash Church for the

1543
01:08:40,329 --> 01:08:47,769
first episode of Keegan you can 502

1544
01:08:45,279 --> 01:08:48,969
processor in Washington and as I

1545
01:08:47,770 --> 01:08:50,980
understand you've got quite a family

1546
01:08:48,969 --> 01:08:54,338
background and co2 processing we're here

1547
01:08:50,979 --> 01:08:59,829
to learn from you today man yeah so you

1548
01:08:54,338 --> 01:09:02,469
guys yeah okay cool cool yeah so about

1549
01:08:59,829 --> 01:09:06,429
five years ago my uncle had gotten one

1550
01:09:02,469 --> 01:09:11,679
of the first co2 adult by a Texan laughs

1551
01:09:06,429 --> 01:09:13,329
pardon me and he started doing a lot of

1552
01:09:11,679 --> 01:09:17,889
like processing for edibles down in

1553
01:09:13,329 --> 01:09:22,329
California and he had a big like natural

1554
01:09:17,889 --> 01:09:25,810
medicine background and once I turned 21

1555
01:09:22,329 --> 01:09:28,149
he said come down I'll give you

1556
01:09:25,810 --> 01:09:29,890
some experience on my machine because I

1557
01:09:28,149 --> 01:09:32,039
really wanted to grouse growing my

1558
01:09:29,890 --> 01:09:36,130
passion I've been watching videos from

1559
01:09:32,039 --> 01:09:38,588
bubbleman and John B and I really

1560
01:09:36,130 --> 01:09:40,329
learned a lot from you guys and I'm

1561
01:09:38,588 --> 01:09:42,100
basically just was all gung-ho about

1562
01:09:40,329 --> 01:09:44,259
growing and he's like well I'll try to

1563
01:09:42,100 --> 01:09:45,489
get you in on like a grow or something

1564
01:09:44,259 --> 01:09:48,488
like that but if you give me two years

1565
01:09:45,488 --> 01:09:51,369
of your time we'll see what you think

1566
01:09:48,488 --> 01:09:53,678
about extract okay that's pretty cool so

1567
01:09:51,369 --> 01:09:54,698
two years went by and I fell in love

1568
01:09:53,679 --> 01:09:56,500
with it it was awesome

1569
01:09:54,698 --> 01:09:58,299
and then he ended up wanting to move

1570
01:09:56,500 --> 01:10:00,908
back down to California he had moved up

1571
01:09:58,300 --> 01:10:08,640
to Washington to be processing in

1572
01:10:00,908 --> 01:10:08,639
Washington so I met up to Bellingham and

1573
01:10:09,270 --> 01:10:14,530
actually met them for a growing position

1574
01:10:12,908 --> 01:10:17,379
because I figured no one around here

1575
01:10:14,529 --> 01:10:20,590
would have any kind of co2 extractor or

1576
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:22,060
anything like that and turns out they'd

1577
01:10:20,590 --> 01:10:25,420
bring me in for an interview and they're

1578
01:10:22,060 --> 01:10:26,800
like tell us about your experience and I

1579
01:10:25,420 --> 01:10:29,140
was like oh I've been doing co2

1580
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:30,940
processing for the last two years and

1581
01:10:29,140 --> 01:10:33,429
they were like whoa well we just bought

1582
01:10:30,939 --> 01:10:40,960
this co2 machine and we don't know how

1583
01:10:33,429 --> 01:10:42,340
to so I started doing a bunch of R&amp;D on

1584
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:43,840
it because I was really only allowed to

1585
01:10:42,340 --> 01:10:47,170
make co2 in the ROM on my uncle's

1586
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:50,529
machine for the edibles and for dabbing

1587
01:10:47,170 --> 01:10:51,369
but I knew that there was a lot more

1588
01:10:50,529 --> 01:10:52,899
that could be done with it

1589
01:10:51,369 --> 01:10:55,809
so I started messing around and I was

1590
01:10:52,899 --> 01:10:57,488
able to do a complete rookie and

1591
01:10:55,810 --> 01:11:00,340
isolation I've been able to use co2

1592
01:10:57,488 --> 01:11:02,649
shattered its crumbles all kinds of

1593
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:04,029
stuff but what's really cool what I'm

1594
01:11:02,649 --> 01:11:06,670
really proud were those turkeys I

1595
01:11:04,029 --> 01:11:08,408
actually just got those back that the

1596
01:11:06,670 --> 01:11:10,719
analytical results back from confidence

1597
01:11:08,408 --> 01:11:14,319
and down here in Washington they're

1598
01:11:10,719 --> 01:11:18,929
analytical laboratory and they came back

1599
01:11:14,319 --> 01:11:21,219
anywhere from I think 65 to 95 percent

1600
01:11:18,929 --> 01:11:24,100
detectable terpenes from I think around

1601
01:11:21,219 --> 01:11:26,649
the 45 they contested for either they

1602
01:11:24,100 --> 01:11:28,570
can test for up to 60 but it was pretty

1603
01:11:26,649 --> 01:11:31,829
fun to see that and they're all below

1604
01:11:28,569 --> 01:11:37,479
0.7 percent THC

1605
01:11:31,829 --> 01:11:41,109
interesting I'm running infinitely yes

1606
01:11:37,479 --> 01:11:43,989
you are a pretty so what what

1607
01:11:41,109 --> 01:11:51,609
temperature are you running at if you're

1608
01:11:43,989 --> 01:11:53,710
allowed to set well it is definitely

1609
01:11:51,609 --> 01:11:55,269
colder than I would have anticipated so

1610
01:11:53,710 --> 01:11:58,300
it's definitely around like 70 degrees

1611
01:11:55,270 --> 01:12:01,180
Fahrenheit I would say is it where

1612
01:11:58,300 --> 01:12:03,970
output is reading so the inside of the

1613
01:12:01,180 --> 01:12:06,659
machine I would imagine is around 65 to

1614
01:12:03,970 --> 01:12:18,070
70 degrees as well the material Colin

1615
01:12:06,659 --> 01:12:19,689
are you grinding your material oh I bet

1616
01:12:18,069 --> 01:12:21,399
I got my headphones hooked up to my

1617
01:12:19,689 --> 01:12:23,199
phone and a laptop so as soon as

1618
01:12:21,399 --> 01:12:25,000
something goes off on the phone laptop

1619
01:12:23,199 --> 01:12:28,779
cuts out sorry about that guys

1620
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:32,859
I assume that finding your material yeah

1621
01:12:28,779 --> 01:12:35,739
so I completely pulverize it which is

1622
01:12:32,859 --> 01:12:39,069
completely unlike what I would do for

1623
01:12:35,739 --> 01:12:41,529
propane or butane hash live but

1624
01:12:39,069 --> 01:12:43,090
basically allowing all of that surface

1625
01:12:41,529 --> 01:12:47,099
area to be present on the material

1626
01:12:43,090 --> 01:12:50,140
allows the co2 co2 to do a better job

1627
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:52,450
extracting all of the essential oils and

1628
01:12:50,140 --> 01:12:54,640
also prevents the co2 from channeling in

1629
01:12:52,449 --> 01:12:56,889
the column because a lot of times when

1630
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:58,630
that initial burst of co2 happens if you

1631
01:12:56,890 --> 01:13:02,560
don't have a proper pack where you don't

1632
01:12:58,630 --> 01:13:04,960
have like a uniform material size or

1633
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:06,490
particle size I should say you can get

1634
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:11,980
join and then that'll really decrease

1635
01:13:06,489 --> 01:13:14,829
your you.yeah interest talked about that

1636
01:13:11,979 --> 01:13:16,449
channeling in BHO extraction and why he

1637
01:13:14,829 --> 01:13:19,090
doesn't understand why so many people

1638
01:13:16,449 --> 01:13:22,119
are using columns he uses like a weird

1639
01:13:19,090 --> 01:13:23,650
well I think it's exacerbated under high

1640
01:13:22,119 --> 01:13:27,789
pressure because everything is packed

1641
01:13:23,649 --> 01:13:31,509
into like a been a I invited yeah and so

1642
01:13:27,789 --> 01:13:34,239
it's gonna find a path just doesn't have

1643
01:13:31,510 --> 01:13:36,280
at least resistance it doesn't grinding

1644
01:13:34,239 --> 01:13:42,010
the raw material cause caffeine loss

1645
01:13:36,279 --> 01:13:44,199
just doing that um well if you're so I

1646
01:13:42,010 --> 01:13:44,769
mean as soon as you cut the plant down

1647
01:13:44,199 --> 01:13:49,538
you

1648
01:13:44,769 --> 01:13:53,590
to remonstrate no I just I understand

1649
01:13:49,538 --> 01:13:56,198
but I when you started you said you had

1650
01:13:53,590 --> 01:13:58,239
note that you've got all the terpenes or

1651
01:13:56,198 --> 01:13:59,319
you had no turkey loss I forget exactly

1652
01:13:58,238 --> 01:14:03,038
what you said

1653
01:13:59,319 --> 01:14:05,139
oh no actor Phoenix traction and so are

1654
01:14:03,038 --> 01:14:05,979
you getting all the terpenes that are in

1655
01:14:05,139 --> 01:14:11,109
a fresh plant

1656
01:14:05,979 --> 01:14:15,029
um I'm able to match I'm able to pull

1657
01:14:11,109 --> 01:14:15,029
anywhere from 80 to 100 milliliters

1658
01:14:15,899 --> 01:14:20,948
do you take recovered material and do

1659
01:14:18,639 --> 01:14:22,920
like an ethanol attraction and shoot the

1660
01:14:20,948 --> 01:14:26,529
GC to make sure you've gotten all your

1661
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:28,149
cannabinoid absolutely so that's

1662
01:14:26,529 --> 01:14:29,828
actually one of the funnest things I've

1663
01:14:28,149 --> 01:14:32,138
just come out with on the market here in

1664
01:14:29,828 --> 01:14:34,960
Washington I call it a high terpene

1665
01:14:32,139 --> 01:14:37,090
full-spectrum absolute so I do a couple

1666
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:38,559
processes in the co2 machine where I

1667
01:14:37,090 --> 01:14:43,538
remove all the lower molecular weight

1668
01:14:38,559 --> 01:14:45,489
constituents of the plant and then I run

1669
01:14:43,538 --> 01:14:48,279
the material in cold critical ethanol

1670
01:14:45,488 --> 01:14:50,888
baking and then I filter it with silica

1671
01:14:48,279 --> 01:14:55,050
and a couple other media's and I'm and I

1672
01:14:50,889 --> 01:14:58,300
end up with around a 90 to 92 percent

1673
01:14:55,050 --> 01:15:00,489
overall cannabinoid extraction or after

1674
01:14:58,300 --> 01:15:02,889
that I should say and then I read it's

1675
01:15:00,488 --> 01:15:06,279
native terpenes back into it and other

1676
01:15:02,889 --> 01:15:09,429
than the percentage of seven to nine

1677
01:15:06,279 --> 01:15:12,219
percent okay but answered my question

1678
01:15:09,429 --> 01:15:15,730
basically the the co2 extraction is not

1679
01:15:12,219 --> 01:15:18,399
grabbing everything no cf3 never does

1680
01:15:15,729 --> 01:15:21,518
unless you're using psi of upwards of

1681
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:24,248
over 4,000 I would say right right right

1682
01:15:21,519 --> 01:15:26,440
so what and then that's kind of bad what

1683
01:15:24,248 --> 01:15:29,590
what percentage of cannabinoids are you

1684
01:15:26,439 --> 01:15:31,198
removing in your first pass co2

1685
01:15:29,590 --> 01:15:36,400
extraction

1686
01:15:31,198 --> 01:15:40,960
um so I'm in to pull an extract that has

1687
01:15:36,399 --> 01:15:42,879
around seventy five percent THC

1688
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:45,788
percentage and then if I were to turn

1689
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:51,010
around and run the already land material

1690
01:15:45,788 --> 01:15:52,960
that I ran for co2 in ethanol I would be

1691
01:15:51,010 --> 01:15:57,159
lucky to get maybe a one to two percent

1692
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:58,789
return is that by weight one to two

1693
01:15:57,158 --> 01:16:02,449
percent of the total weight

1694
01:15:58,789 --> 01:16:05,119
correct yes um but I think stead of

1695
01:16:02,449 --> 01:16:07,279
running it for co2 in bowling that can

1696
01:16:05,119 --> 01:16:09,170
even wait to co2 I just remember all the

1697
01:16:07,279 --> 01:16:11,029
lowermost well not for all the products

1698
01:16:09,170 --> 01:16:12,859
but for the high turkey naps to loot in

1699
01:16:11,029 --> 01:16:15,319
particular and all those lower molecular

1700
01:16:12,859 --> 01:16:17,689
weight product components are completely

1701
01:16:15,319 --> 01:16:21,729
removed and then the Kievan weights are

1702
01:16:17,689 --> 01:16:21,729
left for the extraction of the culture

1703
01:16:21,939 --> 01:16:28,009
so you're able to fractionate out a wax

1704
01:16:25,340 --> 01:16:30,050
free lipid free fraction by doing

1705
01:16:28,010 --> 01:16:31,100
differential let down a pressure to

1706
01:16:30,050 --> 01:16:35,390
where you're getting an enriched

1707
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:38,990
cannabinoid fraction yes basically is

1708
01:16:35,390 --> 01:16:44,810
that THC a or is a THC a CA yeah it's

1709
01:16:38,989 --> 01:16:46,699
around 89% THC a 88 percent THC a right

1710
01:16:44,810 --> 01:16:48,650
so you could prepare tea it's here this

1711
01:16:46,699 --> 01:16:51,250
way yeah

1712
01:16:48,649 --> 01:16:53,379
that's actually so the cool thing too is

1713
01:16:51,250 --> 01:16:55,729
everybody's doing these high terpene

1714
01:16:53,380 --> 01:16:58,390
extracts and uh I really wanted to do my

1715
01:16:55,729 --> 01:17:00,949
own rendition because I've I really

1716
01:16:58,390 --> 01:17:02,420
originated dabbing hydrocarbons I'm

1717
01:17:00,949 --> 01:17:04,849
really in trying to steer away from him

1718
01:17:02,420 --> 01:17:06,890
and what was really cool is from co2 and

1719
01:17:04,850 --> 01:17:09,470
ethanol I could create the same kind of

1720
01:17:06,890 --> 01:17:12,650
product and I still had I was talking to

1721
01:17:09,470 --> 01:17:15,680
Sam and it was crazy the THC a crystals

1722
01:17:12,649 --> 01:17:20,659
still formed the same when you be

1723
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:22,000
waiting period for the carbon hi Turkey

1724
01:17:20,659 --> 01:17:24,199
next track as it did for the

1725
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:28,399
reintroduction of the turkeys to the

1726
01:17:24,199 --> 01:17:30,349
absolute you're still seeing

1727
01:17:28,399 --> 01:17:34,489
crystallization after you add your

1728
01:17:30,350 --> 01:17:36,380
turkey back in here yeah so after that

1729
01:17:34,489 --> 01:17:38,210
like a week or two there will be a

1730
01:17:36,380 --> 01:17:39,980
there'll be a layer between like the

1731
01:17:38,210 --> 01:17:41,449
cannabinoid section and the terpene

1732
01:17:39,979 --> 01:17:44,419
section and they'll be just these layer

1733
01:17:41,449 --> 01:17:45,559
of crystals I can only imagine from what

1734
01:17:44,420 --> 01:17:47,270
you and I were talking I haven't gotten

1735
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:48,530
tested yet but from what you and I were

1736
01:17:47,270 --> 01:17:52,430
talking about I can only imagine that

1737
01:17:48,529 --> 01:17:54,319
with you potentially THC a yeah so

1738
01:17:52,430 --> 01:17:56,390
they're separated so I've heard a lot of

1739
01:17:54,319 --> 01:18:00,309
people who were growing you know Turkey

1740
01:17:56,390 --> 01:18:02,960
they're growing crystals and intervenes

1741
01:18:00,310 --> 01:18:04,310
my naturopathic friend was just telling

1742
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:06,500
me the other day yeah there's a lot of

1743
01:18:04,310 --> 01:18:08,300
extracting as well he's uh he's moving

1744
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:11,899
down to Oregon to new industrial hemp

1745
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:12,659
processing for CBD but he was telling me

1746
01:18:11,899 --> 01:18:14,489
like a

1747
01:18:12,659 --> 01:18:16,229
year ago we're gonna find out here

1748
01:18:14,489 --> 01:18:20,189
pretty soon that terpenes are the best

1749
01:18:16,229 --> 01:18:22,739
solvent for extracting THC and now I'm

1750
01:18:20,189 --> 01:18:25,349
like seeing this and I believe them it's

1751
01:18:22,739 --> 01:18:27,899
like if only we could extract enough and

1752
01:18:25,350 --> 01:18:32,550
then be able to recover them to this

1753
01:18:27,899 --> 01:19:02,089
seem to grief oh yeah yeah I guess we

1754
01:18:32,550 --> 01:19:07,380
can but they're still awesome yes and

1755
01:19:02,090 --> 01:19:09,150
the pen cartridge as well as the high 13

1756
01:19:07,380 --> 01:19:14,430
full spectrum absolute which is kind of

1757
01:19:09,149 --> 01:19:22,109
like a crumpled kind of sugar wax I

1758
01:19:14,430 --> 01:19:26,220
guess I'd say but here is how many

1759
01:19:22,109 --> 01:19:27,899
different ages would have been told how

1760
01:19:26,220 --> 01:19:31,140
many different terpenes do you actually

1761
01:19:27,899 --> 01:19:33,869
find in that have you have you measured

1762
01:19:31,140 --> 01:19:35,910
it with the GCF ID well then so that's

1763
01:19:33,869 --> 01:19:37,590
the hardest thing is a lot of the

1764
01:19:35,909 --> 01:19:39,689
analytical laboratories down here as of

1765
01:19:37,590 --> 01:19:44,640
recently could only test for about a

1766
01:19:39,689 --> 01:19:49,679
year ago 26 now I think it's 40 terpenes

1767
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:51,480
and these have I would say over 200

1768
01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:55,440
chemical constituents that make up that

1769
01:19:51,479 --> 01:19:56,039
profile with terpenes flavonoids canna

1770
01:19:55,439 --> 01:20:03,179
Flavin's

1771
01:19:56,039 --> 01:20:07,890
and the whole kind of plethora of okhta

1772
01:20:03,180 --> 01:20:10,800
material or is it for oral it can be

1773
01:20:07,890 --> 01:20:12,840
further both that's irie added into

1774
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:14,670
absolute for flavor and we have people

1775
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:16,319
putting it on ice cream I like to put it

1776
01:20:14,670 --> 01:20:20,220
in my water bottle I put one drop in at

1777
01:20:16,319 --> 01:20:22,619
32 ounce yeah putting it on all kinds of

1778
01:20:20,220 --> 01:20:24,570
food and pretty much everything we've

1779
01:20:22,619 --> 01:20:26,309
been making some kind of topicals out of

1780
01:20:24,569 --> 01:20:28,639
it but it's just

1781
01:20:26,310 --> 01:20:32,220
so expensive in a topical matter that's

1782
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:33,840
it requires so much for it even kind of

1783
01:20:32,220 --> 01:20:47,970
keep the potency even if you're using

1784
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:49,800
some kind of binder it would have to be

1785
01:20:47,970 --> 01:20:53,180
tested for all the terpenes for you to

1786
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:53,180
find that out and he said it right

1787
01:20:53,779 --> 01:20:59,460
they're not testing for as many as maybe

1788
01:20:56,279 --> 01:21:01,619
SC Labs is down in California yeah you

1789
01:20:59,460 --> 01:21:04,439
guys know how many they test for I think

1790
01:21:01,619 --> 01:21:07,800
I haven't heard anybody testing for more

1791
01:21:04,439 --> 01:21:10,529
than 50 except for we did 20 years ago

1792
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:13,199
we we had about a hundred but there's a

1793
01:21:10,529 --> 01:21:15,960
hundred and fifty so even we were only

1794
01:21:13,199 --> 01:21:18,329
testing in two thirds but we tested for

1795
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:21,390
all the more common ones so the ones we

1796
01:21:18,329 --> 01:21:26,399
weren't testing before were rarely found

1797
01:21:21,390 --> 01:21:29,220
in tiny tiny tiny amounts we probably

1798
01:21:26,399 --> 01:21:31,859
average just think that we have the

1799
01:21:29,220 --> 01:21:33,449
majority of the main players in the

1800
01:21:31,859 --> 01:21:35,549
terpene world to be in tested four and

1801
01:21:33,449 --> 01:21:37,289
the ones we're missing or rather my

1802
01:21:35,550 --> 01:21:40,230
nutri do you think there's some still

1803
01:21:37,289 --> 01:21:43,829
real pharmacological effects wise noble

1804
01:21:40,229 --> 01:21:47,279
airs that we're missing Sam Sam can you

1805
01:21:43,829 --> 01:21:52,739
hear me which Sam are you talking to you

1806
01:21:47,279 --> 01:21:57,719
goddamn it obviously all right well

1807
01:21:52,739 --> 01:22:02,939
anyway puppet Sam I'm going to address

1808
01:21:57,720 --> 01:22:07,350
this comment to you myself John Mark

1809
01:22:02,939 --> 01:22:12,269
herring and the people at scientific

1810
01:22:07,350 --> 01:22:16,520
7/10 Clancy we have obtained our

1811
01:22:12,270 --> 01:22:20,060
obtaining from Japan a heat pump

1812
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:23,940
they uses helium that will allow us to

1813
01:22:20,060 --> 01:22:26,490
reach temperatures minus 140 of course

1814
01:22:23,939 --> 01:22:30,029
we're not going to shoot for the - 140

1815
01:22:26,489 --> 01:22:32,460
and it's a Stirling engine and what

1816
01:22:30,029 --> 01:22:35,699
we're going to do with it is shoot for

1817
01:22:32,460 --> 01:22:40,019
somewhere around what the current

1818
01:22:35,699 --> 01:22:42,210
temperatures are and - 80 are minus 100

1819
01:22:40,019 --> 01:22:43,920
to see if we can't blame some of those

1820
01:22:42,210 --> 01:22:49,439
other campaigns that have been missing

1821
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:53,460
up till now this find over 50 terpenes

1822
01:22:49,439 --> 01:22:55,888
in the average sample we analyzed and we

1823
01:22:53,460 --> 01:22:59,189
only had a hundred terpenes if we would

1824
01:22:55,889 --> 01:23:01,769
have had a hundred and fifty all of the

1825
01:22:59,189 --> 01:23:04,288
terpenes that have been ID'd in cannabis

1826
01:23:01,769 --> 01:23:09,030
so far who knows we might have found 60

1827
01:23:04,288 --> 01:23:10,649
or 70 I really can't say well do you

1828
01:23:09,029 --> 01:23:12,359
think it's because of the temperatures

1829
01:23:10,649 --> 01:23:14,158
or because some of the plants aren't

1830
01:23:12,359 --> 01:23:15,899
growing all the terpenes I'm sort of

1831
01:23:14,158 --> 01:23:19,558
siding with the fact that we haven't got

1832
01:23:15,899 --> 01:23:22,549
cold enough yet to condense some of them

1833
01:23:19,559 --> 01:23:26,029
that are very low it may also be that

1834
01:23:22,550 --> 01:23:29,699
some of these terpenes are more found in

1835
01:23:26,029 --> 01:23:32,849
early growing and young juvenile plants

1836
01:23:29,698 --> 01:23:36,118
rather than really really adult plants I

1837
01:23:32,849 --> 01:23:38,699
mean I myself always like to grow my

1838
01:23:36,118 --> 01:23:44,578
plants until they're resin is really

1839
01:23:38,698 --> 01:23:49,049
fully finished adding on and it the

1840
01:23:44,578 --> 01:23:51,719
smell definitely changes so III assume

1841
01:23:49,050 --> 01:23:54,329
maybe some of them really really really

1842
01:23:51,719 --> 01:23:56,689
volatile one for me and lost but I don't

1843
01:23:54,328 --> 01:23:59,578
have any proof of this I just assume it

1844
01:23:56,689 --> 01:24:01,589
well I expected a couple of brand new

1845
01:23:59,578 --> 01:24:04,139
fresh plants that I chopped down this

1846
01:24:01,590 --> 01:24:05,670
year I cut it down and ten minutes later

1847
01:24:04,139 --> 01:24:08,909
I put them in the extractor and

1848
01:24:05,670 --> 01:24:12,269
extracted them and the flavor the flavor

1849
01:24:08,908 --> 01:24:17,908
and the taste from them is pretty much

1850
01:24:12,269 --> 01:24:20,340
off the charts it's truly one hit stuff

1851
01:24:17,908 --> 01:24:22,589
I can take one out there but it tastes

1852
01:24:20,340 --> 01:24:26,460
like a fresh flower I mean it's like a

1853
01:24:22,590 --> 01:24:30,630
brand new fresh flower right away and

1854
01:24:26,460 --> 01:24:32,939
it's beautiful stuff and I'm thinking

1855
01:24:30,630 --> 01:24:35,309
that concentrates probably are gonna

1856
01:24:32,939 --> 01:24:38,969
head in this direction by the way John I

1857
01:24:35,309 --> 01:24:43,619
patted excuse me I copyrighted the term

1858
01:24:38,969 --> 01:24:44,849
fresh flower hey internet from your mic

1859
01:24:43,618 --> 01:24:46,498
a little bit you're blowing up the

1860
01:24:44,849 --> 01:24:50,670
speaker's you're too close to Mike you

1861
01:24:46,498 --> 01:24:52,559
need to be better I think so let me I'll

1862
01:24:50,670 --> 01:24:56,579
see what the audience says here

1863
01:24:52,560 --> 01:25:00,920
I think we're good anyway I'll send you

1864
01:24:56,579 --> 01:25:00,920
25 cents say okay thank you very much

1865
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:08,640
sorry mr. hideous had the funniest

1866
01:25:06,270 --> 01:25:11,160
comment he's like the mic is inside his

1867
01:25:08,640 --> 01:25:13,410
mouth you were coming through loud loud

1868
01:25:11,159 --> 01:25:16,079
and clear let me tell you blowing up my

1869
01:25:13,409 --> 01:25:18,300
speakers well I got a new microphone and

1870
01:25:16,079 --> 01:25:21,300
I didn't know that how it worked on

1871
01:25:18,300 --> 01:25:24,630
other eyes I'm letting it right now no

1872
01:25:21,300 --> 01:25:26,190
it works exceptionally you definitely

1873
01:25:24,630 --> 01:25:29,520
don't have to be so close to it but that

1874
01:25:26,189 --> 01:25:31,109
was awesome glad to have you we had yeah

1875
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:34,650
we had keegan telling us a little bit

1876
01:25:31,109 --> 01:25:37,049
about a co2 extraction earlier he's been

1877
01:25:34,649 --> 01:25:38,549
I don't know were you gonna like throw

1878
01:25:37,050 --> 01:25:40,350
something in the column and run a batch

1879
01:25:38,550 --> 01:25:44,250
or is that just like not gonna happen

1880
01:25:40,350 --> 01:25:48,800
this takes 20 hours to do a run Jesus

1881
01:25:44,250 --> 01:25:54,090
what a pain in the ass takes two hours

1882
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:56,340
yeah what's faster a terpene run or it

1883
01:25:54,090 --> 01:25:59,069
can happen right run or are you doing

1884
01:25:56,340 --> 01:26:05,340
them simultaneously what's the story

1885
01:25:59,069 --> 01:26:07,349
well so if I'm gonna be doing I'm going

1886
01:26:05,340 --> 01:26:11,340
to be doing HDFS eh I'll just do the

1887
01:26:07,350 --> 01:26:14,220
terpene run and then I'll use a shop vac

1888
01:26:11,340 --> 01:26:16,619
and all that stuff gets sucked out and

1889
01:26:14,220 --> 01:26:18,630
then ran through colds critical ethanol

1890
01:26:16,619 --> 01:26:21,119
Nicole critical ethanol takes no time

1891
01:26:18,630 --> 01:26:25,079
the only the only bottleneck there is

1892
01:26:21,119 --> 01:26:26,640
just the evaporation of solvent what

1893
01:26:25,079 --> 01:26:28,829
part of the process like why does it

1894
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:31,619
take 20 hours what where is that time

1895
01:26:28,829 --> 01:26:35,430
spent during their own two hours per

1896
01:26:31,619 --> 01:26:37,109
pound just in the soak time to just in

1897
01:26:35,430 --> 01:26:39,740
the process yeah just in the processing

1898
01:26:37,109 --> 01:26:42,179
time that's all doubt you're not flowing

1899
01:26:39,739 --> 01:26:44,639
it's flowing the whole time yeah it's

1900
01:26:42,180 --> 01:26:47,400
continuous flow yeah it's continuous

1901
01:26:44,640 --> 01:26:49,700
flow for 20 hours yes flowing it through

1902
01:26:47,399 --> 01:26:54,509
that thing at how much per hour

1903
01:26:49,699 --> 01:26:56,550
continuously I'm sorry what's that how

1904
01:26:54,510 --> 01:27:01,140
much per hour are you flowing through

1905
01:26:56,550 --> 01:27:04,190
the column continuously for 20 hours I'm

1906
01:27:01,140 --> 01:27:04,190
not sure

1907
01:27:05,560 --> 01:27:15,340
what pressure are you putting it through

1908
01:27:08,060 --> 01:27:22,130
there anywhere from 70 to 80 hundred psi

1909
01:27:15,340 --> 01:27:25,100
and it takes 20 hours 20 hours and

1910
01:27:22,130 --> 01:27:29,690
that's crazy Myron's take like 38 to 42

1911
01:27:25,100 --> 01:27:32,770
minutes so just yeah right well and

1912
01:27:29,689 --> 01:27:37,460
that's because how much material is that

1913
01:27:32,770 --> 01:27:38,840
10 pounds but yeah so so the reason is

1914
01:27:37,460 --> 01:27:42,439
because all right you see that giant

1915
01:27:38,840 --> 01:27:45,110
green thing right there right in the

1916
01:27:42,439 --> 01:27:48,319
back part right here that is a giant

1917
01:27:45,109 --> 01:27:50,929
diaphragm compressor can't exceed too

1918
01:27:48,319 --> 01:27:53,329
high of a PSI but it allows me to keep

1919
01:27:50,929 --> 01:27:55,579
everything super cold so that those

1920
01:27:53,329 --> 01:27:58,698
terpenes don't exceed a temperature

1921
01:27:55,579 --> 01:28:00,109
realistically after the co2 crosses them

1922
01:27:58,698 --> 01:28:05,599
they don't get hotter than 30 degrees

1923
01:28:00,109 --> 01:28:07,130
Fahrenheit 30 degrees Fahrenheit that'll

1924
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:08,989
bubble up your bubble if you leave it

1925
01:28:07,130 --> 01:28:13,400
out on the in the Sun and you know not

1926
01:28:08,988 --> 01:28:16,819
Fahrenheit sorry Celsius Celsius yeah I

1927
01:28:13,399 --> 01:28:18,979
left bubble drying in Jamaica Oh out in

1928
01:28:16,819 --> 01:28:21,049
this it was in the shade at the time on

1929
01:28:18,979 --> 01:28:22,849
some cardboard but I guess the Sun came

1930
01:28:21,050 --> 01:28:29,390
out of when I went out to grab it it was

1931
01:28:22,850 --> 01:28:32,570
like bubbling I was things I'm always

1932
01:28:29,390 --> 01:28:36,170
surprised hottest places the come on

1933
01:28:32,569 --> 01:28:40,729
tell the truth Marcus it was routine it

1934
01:28:36,170 --> 01:28:43,069
was the beauty so Keegan and de mer here

1935
01:28:40,729 --> 01:28:46,609
in Northern California used to stop

1936
01:28:43,069 --> 01:28:49,579
round I think I can kill a lot of time

1937
01:28:46,609 --> 01:28:51,408
out of your very lengthy process that

1938
01:28:49,579 --> 01:28:54,350
you're doing and make things go a lot

1939
01:28:51,408 --> 01:28:57,679
easier for you for the future for the

1940
01:28:54,350 --> 01:29:01,070
ethanol whatever it is you're doing

1941
01:28:57,679 --> 01:29:03,920
20-hour process for the co2 I'm sure I

1942
01:29:01,069 --> 01:29:04,429
can help you improve on all that okay

1943
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:07,179

1944
01:29:04,429 --> 01:29:10,279

1947
01:29:11,829 --> 01:29:16,519
yeah well pleasure to meet you I'd

1948
01:29:14,988 --> 01:29:17,558
listen to what you had to say this

1949
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:20,729
morning

1950
01:29:17,559 --> 01:29:24,279
and I thought you could use a hand on

1951
01:29:20,729 --> 01:29:26,469
some information that your other friend

1952
01:29:24,279 --> 01:29:28,599
who taught you how to run this maybe

1953
01:29:26,469 --> 01:29:31,448
didn't have to give you at the time and

1954
01:29:28,599 --> 01:29:33,038
so and whatnot and because it's always

1955
01:29:31,448 --> 01:29:34,958
good to learn more information that's

1956
01:29:33,038 --> 01:29:36,429
why the conversation notes it's funny no

1957
01:29:34,958 --> 01:29:39,128
matter what we talk about in here

1958
01:29:36,429 --> 01:29:41,019
whether it's BHO or co2 or bubble hash

1959
01:29:39,128 --> 01:29:41,439
or Dreyse if there's off someone in the

1960
01:29:41,019 --> 01:29:43,719
chat

1961
01:29:41,439 --> 01:29:45,369
oh that's bunk no this are the only

1962
01:29:43,719 --> 01:29:47,229
thing you need to do is this this is

1963
01:29:45,368 --> 01:29:48,908
what everyone needs to do what I like

1964
01:29:47,229 --> 01:29:51,010
and it's just like I've gotten to a

1965
01:29:48,908 --> 01:29:53,049
point now where I really appreciate all

1966
01:29:51,010 --> 01:29:55,689
the different extraction methods and all

1967
01:29:53,050 --> 01:29:58,538
the different ways to acquire these

1968
01:29:55,689 --> 01:30:01,539
unique components that clearly you know

1969
01:29:58,538 --> 01:30:02,978
you know are beyond medicinal for us I

1970
01:30:01,538 --> 01:30:06,068
would say I would go as far as saying

1971
01:30:02,979 --> 01:30:07,749
that they're a dietary need for for

1972
01:30:06,069 --> 01:30:09,760
human so why wouldn't we come up with as

1973
01:30:07,748 --> 01:30:13,059
many cool ways to get them off the plant

1974
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:15,248
and and get them into into our bodies

1975
01:30:13,059 --> 01:30:16,748
there's no such thing as all rights and

1976
01:30:15,248 --> 01:30:18,998
all wrong there's benefits and

1977
01:30:16,748 --> 01:30:27,639
advantages and disadvantages to each one

1978
01:30:18,998 --> 01:30:32,019

that's a big concern of mine and right

2015
01:32:07,420 --> 01:32:10,960
now it's something that I don't really

2016
01:32:09,399 --> 01:32:12,219
feel right talking about my concerns

2017
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:15,130
with someone two people lose some things

2018
01:32:12,220 --> 01:32:18,880
but we just had a huge uptick in

2019
01:32:15,130 --> 01:32:20,859
families that have come forward because

2020
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:24,659
of some online attention we had a couple

2021
01:32:20,859 --> 01:32:27,819
posts go viral let me see if I could

2022
01:32:24,659 --> 01:32:30,909
share this with you guys so some of our

2023
01:32:27,819 --> 01:32:32,500
kids are really coming forward some of

2024
01:32:30,909 --> 01:32:36,220
our families right so this is a little

2025
01:32:32,500 --> 01:32:39,130
guy Reed and these things is that

2026
01:32:36,220 --> 01:32:42,880
picture coming through see that yes

2027
01:32:39,130 --> 01:32:45,760
so boom forward with which is great but

2028
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:47,199
what happens is you know we we get a

2029
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:48,900
large intake and families who are

2030
01:32:47,199 --> 01:32:52,119
looking for help is a little boy with

2031
01:32:48,899 --> 01:32:56,739
epidermolysis bullosa and when that

2032
01:32:52,119 --> 01:32:59,619
happens we get a huge intake and we lost

2033
01:32:56,739 --> 01:33:02,409
a lot some of our partners in these

2034
01:32:59,619 --> 01:33:04,960
fires and I just really want to make

2035
01:33:02,409 --> 01:33:07,029
sure we can make commitments and help as

2036
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:08,649
many families as we can so you know I

2037
01:33:07,029 --> 01:33:11,439
don't want to get all touchy and

2038
01:33:08,649 --> 01:33:13,089
emotional on us now but injured not only

2039
01:33:11,439 --> 01:33:14,649
is that thank you but I really can't

2040
01:33:13,090 --> 01:33:16,390
thank you enough for anybody who wants

2041
01:33:14,649 --> 01:33:18,449
to step up because more now than ever

2042
01:33:16,390 --> 01:33:22,450
some of our commitments that we've made

2043
01:33:18,449 --> 01:33:25,389
to families on projected donations is

2044
01:33:22,449 --> 01:33:26,920
kind of up in the air and nothing scares

2045
01:33:25,390 --> 01:33:29,260
me more than having to call a family

2046
01:33:26,920 --> 01:33:32,739
back and tell them that we were wrong

2047
01:33:29,260 --> 01:33:35,230
and we can't help them well very much I

2048
01:33:32,739 --> 01:33:38,429
don't know if you're interested I could

2049
01:33:35,229 --> 01:33:41,649
also give you some THC oil too because

2050
01:33:38,430 --> 01:33:44,400
we end up with a lot of it over a period

2051
01:33:41,649 --> 01:33:48,339
of time and I don't really do anything

2052
01:33:44,399 --> 01:33:51,039
Holy Smoke so many dabs at a time know

2053
01:33:48,340 --> 01:33:56,789
if you want some THC oil to mix with it

2054
01:33:51,039 --> 01:33:56,789
as well yeah yeah absolutely

2055
01:33:58,529 --> 01:34:03,399
they'll be more valuable for me because

2056
01:34:01,420 --> 01:34:05,140
me literally hard for us in our in our

2057
01:34:03,399 --> 01:34:17,739
old-fashioned methods to get really good

2058
01:34:05,140 --> 01:34:21,280
quality makes the THC a oil and you have

2059
01:34:17,739 --> 01:34:26,130
to heat it in order to get our process

2060
01:34:21,279 --> 01:34:28,539
is completely cold so it'll be alive

2061
01:34:26,130 --> 01:34:31,930

Walmart make sure all the links I share

2097
01:36:17,810 --> 01:36:23,180
to be donating to and I got people like

2098
01:36:21,109 --> 01:36:24,799
why would you say that you know you're

2099
01:36:23,180 --> 01:36:27,260
keeping people from donating I'm like

2100
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:29,449
because I want them to donate where they

2101
01:36:27,260 --> 01:36:32,570
where it's where it should go

2102
01:36:29,449 --> 01:36:35,119
that's why so we're gonna put all the

2103
01:36:32,569 --> 01:36:37,009
links know what's funny that you say

2104
01:36:35,119 --> 01:36:39,140
that mark cuz I leads me right into a

2105
01:36:37,010 --> 01:36:41,030
segue so I'm this kind of started with

2106
01:36:39,140 --> 01:36:42,260
people right away save raising money for

2107
01:36:41,029 --> 01:36:45,529
me and Jill cuz we lost we lost

2108
01:36:42,260 --> 01:36:46,909
everything like real and but that's fine

2109
01:36:45,529 --> 01:36:50,119
I mean I have bank accounts I have a

2110
01:36:46,909 --> 01:36:53,090
business I I'm good and so immediately I

2111
01:36:50,119 --> 01:36:54,619
turned it into any money race for me or

2112
01:36:53,090 --> 01:36:56,810
my organization that's gonna be donated

2113
01:36:54,619 --> 01:36:59,119
to the victims of the fire and then

2114
01:36:56,810 --> 01:37:01,340
Patrick got involved on the ground so we

2115
01:36:59,119 --> 01:37:03,859
don't have to go through the Red Cross

2116
01:37:01,340 --> 01:37:05,600
or anything like that so absolutely the

2117
01:37:03,859 --> 01:37:07,399
links that we're working on through

2118
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:09,829
their stream nerds and everything

2119
01:37:07,399 --> 01:37:11,420
those checks the only way they work is

2120
01:37:09,829 --> 01:37:14,420
if like you buy packaged seeds from us

2121
01:37:11,420 --> 01:37:17,000

2122
01:37:14,420 --> 01:37:18,440
give the money to Pat and Pat shows us

2123
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:20,689

chihuahua and a very mouthy parrot here

2162
01:38:45,479 --> 01:38:49,559
because there's 45 acres and there ain't

2163
01:38:47,429 --> 01:38:54,509
nobody bothering us and we got a good

2164
01:38:49,559 --> 01:38:57,449
internet connection and a little messy

2165
01:38:54,509 --> 01:39:00,359
you're welcome well as it turns I have

2166
01:38:57,448 --> 01:39:02,458
to look at Indra yeah you have to look

2167
01:39:00,359 --> 01:39:05,609
at interest as it turns out again I'm a

2168
01:39:02,458 --> 01:39:06,929
survivor I'm fine once they let me Elmo

2169
01:39:05,609 --> 01:39:08,519
go off a little bit so once they let me

2170
01:39:06,929 --> 01:39:10,918
go to my house and we can talk about

2171
01:39:08,519 --> 01:39:12,509
that so my lawyer says enough he says

2172
01:39:10,918 --> 01:39:14,548
we're gonna meet at the police line on

2173
01:39:12,509 --> 01:39:17,578
Monday or Tuesday and he's gonna be with

2174
01:39:14,548 --> 01:39:20,069
me in their mouth and the fires out the

2175
01:39:17,578 --> 01:39:21,058
dog the area's done and and my opinion

2176
01:39:20,069 --> 01:39:22,769
to be in the cops would be in just a

2177
01:39:21,059 --> 01:39:24,208
little bearing and I understand they

2178
01:39:22,769 --> 01:39:25,859
need to protect people and everything

2179
01:39:24,208 --> 01:39:27,028
that's my [ __ ] house it's a million

2180
01:39:25,859 --> 01:39:28,139
dollar home that burns the [ __ ]

2181
01:39:27,029 --> 01:39:29,989
ground I need to go up there and see

2182
01:39:28,139 --> 01:39:32,159
what it looks like it's nine days

2183
01:39:29,988 --> 01:39:33,988
haven't said that when I'm done I'm

2184
01:39:32,158 --> 01:39:35,668
going to Arizona and I'm gonna I just

2185
01:39:33,988 --> 01:39:38,728
signed a role of working on sign a

2186
01:39:35,668 --> 01:39:41,219

2187
01:39:38,729 --> 01:39:44,548

2188
01:39:41,219 --> 01:39:46,229
cranking that up next week and so yeah I

2189
01:39:44,548 --> 01:39:48,389
mean I'm not even slowing down I just I

2190
01:39:46,229 --> 01:39:49,829
don't have a home so I'll just go here

2191
01:39:48,389 --> 01:39:51,449
to there here to there and grow lots of

2192
01:39:49,828 --> 01:39:54,328
ganja and continue to overgrow the

2193
01:39:51,448 --> 01:39:57,418
government so what's gonna happen in

2194
01:39:54,328 --> 01:39:59,158
regards to like surance for all of these

2195
01:39:57,418 --> 01:40:01,078
people that lost these homes because you

2196
01:39:59,158 --> 01:40:03,509
got to think of a ton of people some

2197
01:40:01,078 --> 01:40:06,148
people must be insured for their house

2198
01:40:03,509 --> 01:40:08,279
burning down or do people just like yeah

2199
01:40:06,149 --> 01:40:10,439
if you got a home loan that's the great

2200
01:40:08,279 --> 01:40:12,749
topic work if you have a home loan you

2201
01:40:10,439 --> 01:40:14,369
have fire insurance yeah [ __ ] Bank

2202
01:40:12,748 --> 01:40:16,469
don't give you hundreds of thousands of

2203
01:40:14,368 --> 01:40:18,358
dollars without fire so unless your dad

2204
01:40:16,469 --> 01:40:20,759
gave you the house or you built the

2205
01:40:18,359 --> 01:40:22,919
house got fire insurance at that barn so

2206
01:40:20,759 --> 01:40:24,029
but let me I just I'm gonna be real

2207
01:40:22,918 --> 01:40:25,319
hardcore and tell you what fire

2208
01:40:24,029 --> 01:40:27,719
insurance means so

2209
01:40:25,319 --> 01:40:29,609
the very first step is they gave me

2210
01:40:27,719 --> 01:40:30,659
$4,000 a month to live so that's why I

2211
01:40:29,609 --> 01:40:32,039
told you I want to take charity money

2212
01:40:30,659 --> 01:40:34,800
I'm not broke I just don't have a house

2213
01:40:32,039 --> 01:40:36,810
so now I have a lot meant for food and

2214
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:39,779
replacing my lying on a blanket a pillow

2215
01:40:36,810 --> 01:40:40,830
so get that [ __ ] eat so then the first

2216
01:40:39,779 --> 01:40:42,539
thing you do is you write all the

2217
01:40:40,829 --> 01:40:44,670
contents down at your home and it's

2218
01:40:42,539 --> 01:40:45,988
gut-wrenching and my suggestion if you

2219
01:40:44,670 --> 01:40:48,510
have to go through this is not write

2220
01:40:45,988 --> 01:40:49,859
down the bracelet because that has no

2221
01:40:48,510 --> 01:40:52,320
money value you need to write down five

2222
01:40:49,859 --> 01:40:54,238
refrigerators six TVs you have to hit

2223
01:40:52,319 --> 01:40:55,799
the maximum allowable payout for

2224
01:40:54,238 --> 01:40:58,379
property they will tell you what it is

2225
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:59,789
where it's $25,000 or $30,000 whatever

2226
01:40:58,380 --> 01:41:01,710
it is you got to hit that once you hit

2227
01:40:59,789 --> 01:41:03,449
that to cut your check you don't you

2228
01:41:01,710 --> 01:41:05,189
don't really need to say oh I get my

2229
01:41:03,449 --> 01:41:06,869
kids first baby picture because that's

2230
01:41:05,189 --> 01:41:09,119
heart-wrenching and I wish they tell you

2231
01:41:06,869 --> 01:41:11,729
this [ __ ] and then they will establish

2232
01:41:09,119 --> 01:41:13,050
the value of a home in my case they

2233
01:41:11,729 --> 01:41:16,799
saved my homes worth about six hundred

2234
01:41:13,050 --> 01:41:18,210
thousand you can't build it for that

2235
01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:20,640
where I live because there won't be

2236
01:41:18,210 --> 01:41:22,770
enough to buy floors Builders cement or

2237
01:41:20,640 --> 01:41:26,219
anything and so you take your cash out

2238
01:41:22,770 --> 01:41:27,870
now I have a loan on the home remaining

2239
01:41:26,219 --> 01:41:30,180
so it's around three hundred so if you

2240
01:41:27,869 --> 01:41:31,649
take the three hundred from the six

2241
01:41:30,180 --> 01:41:33,210
hundred you get you have three hundred

2242
01:41:31,649 --> 01:41:35,519
thousand dollars left over and you can't

2243
01:41:33,210 --> 01:41:38,100
live in a home for that so you still

2244
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:39,810
have to take another damn loan out when

2245
01:41:38,100 --> 01:41:41,610
your house burns down so that's the

2246
01:41:39,810 --> 01:41:43,560
logistics of your house burning down and

2247
01:41:41,609 --> 01:41:45,059
worse you have to go to the rubble like

2248
01:41:43,560 --> 01:41:47,280
I don't just get the [ __ ] off and not

2249
01:41:45,060 --> 01:41:49,739
deal with it I would love to just move

2250
01:41:47,279 --> 01:41:54,809
on but I have to go deal with the fact

2251
01:41:49,738 --> 01:41:55,949
that on three acres of rubble but Animus

2252
01:41:54,810 --> 01:41:57,960
land and I don't have any [ __ ]

2253
01:41:55,949 --> 01:42:00,599
neighbors anymore so I won't be selling

2254
01:41:57,960 --> 01:42:01,829
it it's also crazy that it's not just

2255
01:42:00,600 --> 01:42:03,329
like you're dealing with your house

2256
01:42:01,829 --> 01:42:05,250
burning down you're dealing with your

2257
01:42:03,329 --> 01:42:07,079
house burning down while everyone around

2258
01:42:05,250 --> 01:42:10,619
you is dealing with their house burning

2259
01:42:07,079 --> 01:42:13,350
down which really changes the earth

2260
01:42:10,619 --> 01:42:15,119
what's that gives me my fusion the guy

2261
01:42:13,350 --> 01:42:18,989
that gives me my infusion his house

2262
01:42:15,119 --> 01:42:23,939
burned down so my nurse and the medicine

2263
01:42:18,988 --> 01:42:26,899
burned down so Jesus that's just hope

2264
01:42:23,939 --> 01:42:29,428
fun folks good

2265
01:42:26,899 --> 01:42:32,429
PFT PFT with you I'm gonna have a pup

2266

with you sub thank you rob Huff a little

2267
01:42:32,429 --> 01:42:36,389
Bowl I can't believe it I knew you were

2268
01:42:34,500 --> 01:42:38,010
getting blown out but I obviously sent

2269
01:42:36,389 --> 01:42:39,868
you a message right away saying dude

2270
01:42:38,010 --> 01:42:43,409

2271
01:42:39,868 --> 01:42:45,988

2272
01:42:43,408 --> 01:42:48,029
want to help me or anybody else we have

2273
01:42:45,988 --> 01:42:49,500
a simple thing wait two weeks and ask us

2274
01:42:48,029 --> 01:42:51,689
what the [ __ ] we need cuz we ain't got a

2275
01:42:49,500 --> 01:42:58,500
clue that's what forest just mentioned

2276
01:42:51,689 --> 01:42:59,969
makes good sense so my dog has PTSD if

2277
01:42:58,500 --> 01:43:01,829
you can't tell you notice the tokens

2278
01:42:59,969 --> 01:43:03,239
three inches from me this is where he

2279
01:43:01,829 --> 01:43:05,368
stays at all times I think the fire

2280
01:43:03,238 --> 01:43:12,539
freaked him out I don't think he's down

2281
01:43:05,368 --> 01:43:15,988
with fire oh it must have freaked so

2282
01:43:12,539 --> 01:43:22,260
many animals out well there's 45 acres

2283
01:43:15,988 --> 01:43:24,419
here for him to run on actually I am no

2284
01:43:22,260 --> 01:43:26,010
joking aside and y'all can get mad at me

2285
01:43:24,420 --> 01:43:27,840
if you want to as soon as I looked at my

2286
01:43:26,010 --> 01:43:30,119
house [ __ ] this place I'm out of the

2287
01:43:27,840 --> 01:43:32,069
fire I'm tired of fire I don't like fire

2288
01:43:30,118 --> 01:43:33,479
I'm not ever gonna live where you can

2289
01:43:32,069 --> 01:43:38,579
burn to death again I can assure you

2290
01:43:33,479 --> 01:43:40,919
that yeah I'm saying just with the

2291
01:43:38,579 --> 01:43:42,899
impact on Silas when we left you know he

2292
01:43:40,920 --> 01:43:45,719
started seizing that afternoon he hasn't

2293
01:43:42,899 --> 01:43:49,439
had a seizure in 38 days and they're

2294
01:43:45,719 --> 01:43:51,658
just now stopping yesterday I mean there

2295
01:43:49,439 --> 01:43:55,469
is something that really is terrifying

2296
01:43:51,658 --> 01:43:58,920
about driving through fire it 4:00 in

2297
01:43:55,469 --> 01:44:02,010
the morning you know and the fear that

2298
01:43:58,920 --> 01:44:04,949
it brings you know fire is there is no

2299
01:44:02,010 --> 01:44:06,750
joke and some cool just experience it

2300
01:44:04,948 --> 01:44:08,158
but those of you haven't when it's on

2301
01:44:06,750 --> 01:44:09,899
the side of the road and you feel that

2302
01:44:08,158 --> 01:44:12,149
key there's nothing it's not like the

2303
01:44:09,899 --> 01:44:14,638
fire in your fireplace when it's a you

2304
01:44:12,149 --> 01:44:19,679
know a thousand acres of heat it is an

2305
01:44:14,639 --> 01:44:21,270
amazingly terrifying experience yeah you

2306
01:44:19,679 --> 01:44:22,829
know it's crazy because we get this

2307
01:44:21,270 --> 01:44:25,349
every year here in British Columbia and

2308
01:44:22,829 --> 01:44:28,829
in fact this year was very very bad for

2309
01:44:25,349 --> 01:44:30,779
BC I want to say it was Fort Nelson I

2310
01:44:28,829 --> 01:44:34,590
could be wrong but there was an entire

2311
01:44:30,779 --> 01:44:36,710
town wiped out as well here in BC just a

2312
01:44:34,590 --> 01:44:38,699
couple of months ago

2313
01:44:36,710 --> 01:44:40,770
ridiculous amount I think it might have

2314
01:44:38,698 --> 01:44:43,319
been like a million acres or something

2315
01:44:40,770 --> 01:44:48,630
that got burned it was it's very bad

2316
01:44:43,319 --> 01:44:51,299
we'd have to do the Google in California

2317
01:44:48,630 --> 01:44:54,060
forests for millions of years it's a

2318
01:44:51,300 --> 01:44:56,820
part of the natural yeah but no no no no

2319
01:44:54,060 --> 01:44:58,469
no no no no no no ginger you're not

2320
01:44:56,819 --> 01:45:02,609
passing that [ __ ] through here this is

2321
01:44:58,469 --> 01:45:05,369
the worst [ __ ] more houses in any

2322
01:45:02,609 --> 01:45:07,889
time it's not trees [ __ ] trees it burnt

2323
01:45:05,369 --> 01:45:09,529
people's houses down it Burt eighteen

2324
01:45:07,890 --> 01:45:12,570
hundred houses down on one neighborhood

2325
01:45:09,529 --> 01:45:16,158
that has not happened before eighteen

2326
01:45:12,569 --> 01:45:19,049
hundreds in one [ __ ] subdivision

2327
01:45:16,158 --> 01:45:19,379
I'm sorry I apologize I apologize I'm

2328
01:45:19,050 --> 01:45:22,560
fired

2329
01:45:19,380 --> 01:45:24,869
it's no problem but when you look at the

2330
01:45:22,560 --> 01:45:26,760
Sequoias and things like this had been

2331
01:45:24,869 --> 01:45:30,529
there for a thousand years they're

2332
01:45:26,760 --> 01:45:33,510
scarred from fires every under 200 years

2333
01:45:30,529 --> 01:45:34,889
this is different this is lack of in my

2334
01:45:33,510 --> 01:45:37,890
opinion I'm getting trouble from this

2335
01:45:34,890 --> 01:45:39,659
this is lack of money to ten things I

2336
01:45:37,890 --> 01:45:41,670
saw five hundred cops before I saw a

2337
01:45:39,658 --> 01:45:43,259
single fire truck now I'm not taking

2338
01:45:41,670 --> 01:45:45,480
away from the guys on the line fighting

2339
01:45:43,260 --> 01:45:47,219
the fire I love them please God the

2340
01:45:45,479 --> 01:45:49,769
firemen are the baddest dudes in the

2341
01:45:47,219 --> 01:45:51,270
world but where I live no fire trucks

2342
01:45:49,770 --> 01:45:52,980
came if a fire truck would have driven

2343
01:45:51,270 --> 01:45:54,320
down my street and sprayed water on my

2344
01:45:52,979 --> 01:45:56,158
house that wouldn't have burned down

2345
01:45:54,319 --> 01:45:58,559
seven neighborhoods went down in my

2346
01:45:56,158 --> 01:46:00,509
house 1,800 in the next neighborhood the

2347
01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:02,340
infrastructure of California's [ __ ]

2348
01:46:00,510 --> 01:46:04,590
and that's the story in my opinion

2349
01:46:02,340 --> 01:46:06,179
that's not really being told well the

2350
01:46:04,590 --> 01:46:08,940
other part of the story that isn't being

2351
01:46:06,179 --> 01:46:11,310
told is the the PG&amp;E lines are one of

2352
01:46:08,939 --> 01:46:13,529
the major contributors to why these

2353
01:46:11,310 --> 01:46:15,630
fires started in the first place and the

2354
01:46:13,529 --> 01:46:18,179
crazy thing is is PG&amp;E is the first one

2355
01:46:15,630 --> 01:46:18,989
out there repairing those fire and

2356
01:46:18,179 --> 01:46:25,529
destroyed

2357
01:46:18,988 --> 01:46:28,799
fire lines and just a distribution point

2358
01:46:25,529 --> 01:46:30,599
so it's I don't know where we're gonna

2359
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:32,489
find out the actual truth of where some

2360
01:46:30,600 --> 01:46:35,239
of these fires actually started but from

2361
01:46:32,488 --> 01:46:38,759
what I've been told is faulty lines

2362
01:46:35,238 --> 01:46:41,009
usually what the fire traditionally has

2363
01:46:38,760 --> 01:46:43,980
been lots of rains

2364
01:46:41,010 --> 01:46:49,530
lots of green growth dries out being

2365
01:46:43,979 --> 01:46:50,428
summer it freakin burns but let me say I

2366
01:46:49,529 --> 01:46:51,898
really Paul

2367
01:46:50,429 --> 01:46:53,760
I apologize for snapping at you I

2368
01:46:51,899 --> 01:46:56,128
injured me have a much different

2369
01:46:53,760 --> 01:46:59,819
relationship so I do apologize the well

2370
01:46:56,128 --> 01:47:01,858
I was wrong thank them this is the truth

2371
01:46:59,819 --> 01:47:03,539
and I was there okay you can ask anybody

2372
01:47:01,859 --> 01:47:06,389
there you know people are talking about

2373
01:47:03,538 --> 01:47:09,779
God and laser beams and the government

2374
01:47:06,389 --> 01:47:11,939
and trompe know the wind was blowing 75

2375
01:47:09,779 --> 01:47:15,328
miles an hour no power line whatever the

2376
01:47:11,939 --> 01:47:16,530
whatever the wind was blowing 75 miles

2377
01:47:15,328 --> 01:47:18,929
an hour and that's why my house burned

2378
01:47:16,529 --> 01:47:20,698
down if the wind wasn't blowing 75 miles

2379
01:47:18,929 --> 01:47:22,439
an hour the fire would have burned like

2380
01:47:20,698 --> 01:47:24,509
I did two years ago we looked over there

2381
01:47:22,439 --> 01:47:26,939
and we said oh [ __ ] there's a fire maybe

2382
01:47:24,510 --> 01:47:29,309
we need to evacuate it burned my house

2383
01:47:26,939 --> 01:47:30,869
down in two minutes and then it moves 15

2384
01:47:29,309 --> 01:47:33,599
miles and burned every house down

2385
01:47:30,868 --> 01:47:33,929
because the wind was blowing 75 miles an

2386
01:47:33,599 --> 01:47:36,418
hour

2387
01:47:33,929 --> 01:47:38,729
that's only the trees that's what I was

2388
01:47:36,418 --> 01:47:40,349
saying when we were evacuated it was the

2389
01:47:38,729 --> 01:47:42,239
wind was like nothing I'd ever seen you

2390
01:47:40,349 --> 01:47:45,689
combine wind with dry heat in those

2391
01:47:42,238 --> 01:47:47,848
fires and they move incredibly fast like

2392
01:47:45,689 --> 01:47:49,709
they will chase you down fast it's not

2393
01:47:47,849 --> 01:47:51,659
look at it and know it's a fire so we

2394
01:47:49,708 --> 01:47:53,729
can now run it like they it was

2395
01:47:51,658 --> 01:47:56,128
terrifying how quickly it moves through

2396
01:47:53,729 --> 01:47:57,719
the brush and through the trees but you

2397
01:47:56,128 --> 01:47:59,429
know force saw this last night and then

2398
01:47:57,719 --> 01:48:02,248
I'm gonna spend this real quick if I can

2399
01:47:59,429 --> 01:48:04,319
and because this is sad but you know

2400
01:48:02,248 --> 01:48:06,658
last night the outpouring of health of

2401
01:48:04,319 --> 01:48:09,089
people that want to help is it blows my

2402
01:48:06,658 --> 01:48:12,929
mind actually and the way the community

2403
01:48:09,088 --> 01:48:14,548
has come together I'm over this and me

2404
01:48:12,929 --> 01:48:17,010
personally I mean you guys know I lost

2405
01:48:14,548 --> 01:48:19,229
genetics like genetics you can't find

2406
01:48:17,010 --> 01:48:20,248
and when within three hours we had 90%

2407
01:48:19,229 --> 01:48:22,708
of them back

2408
01:48:20,248 --> 01:48:25,349
I mean people call and say sup got your

2409
01:48:22,708 --> 01:48:27,179
blood rec you do yeah hey sup I got your

2410
01:48:25,349 --> 01:48:29,429

2411
01:48:27,179 --> 01:48:31,559

2412
01:48:29,429 --> 01:48:33,269
can make cherry guys and so while

2413
01:48:31,559 --> 01:48:34,918
they're not in my hand literally don't

2414
01:48:33,269 --> 01:48:37,829
own a seed or a kind of cannabis plant

2415
01:48:34,918 --> 01:48:39,510
right now about 90% of our core genetics

2416
01:48:37,828 --> 01:48:41,759
or it's still around and people are

2417
01:48:39,510 --> 01:48:44,519
working with us to help bring them back

2418
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:45,899
and I and just so you guys know if you

2419
01:48:44,519 --> 01:48:48,659
didn't pay attention we found five

2420
01:48:45,899 --> 01:48:49,979
hundred seeds in my truck and I know

2421
01:48:48,658 --> 01:48:52,318
what they are but I won't tell anybody

2422
01:48:49,979 --> 01:48:53,609
so little thing last night we auctioned

2423
01:48:52,319 --> 01:48:55,048
off half of them and raised thirty five

2424
01:48:53,609 --> 01:48:57,298
hundred dollars and then the other half

2425
01:48:55,048 --> 01:48:59,189
me and my new partner are gonna start a

2426
01:48:57,298 --> 01:49:01,559
creative screen with this special season

2427
01:48:59,189 --> 01:49:02,159
that's called the Phoenix the rise from

2428
01:49:01,559 --> 01:49:05,369
the ashes

2429
01:49:02,159 --> 01:49:08,399
and we germinated seeds today today we

2430
01:49:05,369 --> 01:49:09,559
germinated seeds today that's awesome

2431
01:49:08,399 --> 01:49:12,239
good

2432
01:49:09,560 --> 01:49:16,710
hey stuff you've done something

2433
01:49:12,239 --> 01:49:19,679
different before the fire to maintain

2434
01:49:16,710 --> 01:49:23,279
your collection well I could have a

2435
01:49:19,680 --> 01:49:25,590
vault a fire ready vault or a safe that

2436
01:49:23,279 --> 01:49:29,579
people mark people are the vault you

2437
01:49:25,590 --> 01:49:30,930
give the people but but I mean looking

2438
01:49:29,579 --> 01:49:32,609
back I mean could there have been

2439
01:49:30,930 --> 01:49:37,020
anything that you could have done to

2440
01:49:32,609 --> 01:49:39,179
make your yeah yeah let me looking back

2441
01:49:37,020 --> 01:49:40,950
simply and I meant to do this looking

2442
01:49:39,180 --> 01:49:43,050
back I should have removed all of my

2443
01:49:40,949 --> 01:49:44,670
genetics from one spot I mean I live

2444
01:49:43,050 --> 01:49:46,710
there and last year we had fires that

2445
01:49:44,670 --> 01:49:48,810
wants to but you know you can do this

2446
01:49:46,710 --> 01:49:49,980
all day long I grabbed 1,200 grams of

2447
01:49:48,810 --> 01:49:51,630
hash because that's what I had been

2448
01:49:49,979 --> 01:49:54,000
making for greetings with Frenchy and

2449
01:49:51,630 --> 01:49:56,130
bond the thing that I probably would

2450
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:57,899
have grabbed the most that I'm the most

2451
01:49:56,130 --> 01:50:00,449
heart broke about these are the list of

2452
01:49:57,899 --> 01:50:02,819
50 things I mean a laptop would have had

2453
01:50:00,449 --> 01:50:04,829
my ODEs on it but about a year ago I

2454
01:50:02,819 --> 01:50:06,479
went to the store and I bought a two

2455
01:50:04,829 --> 01:50:08,130
terabyte drive about the size of a

2456
01:50:06,479 --> 01:50:10,169
business card and I put every photograph

2457
01:50:08,130 --> 01:50:12,510
I've ever owned on it and I put every

2458
01:50:10,170 --> 01:50:14,579
song and I put all my files on it and I

2459
01:50:12,510 --> 01:50:17,909
didn't pick the [ __ ] up I lost every

2460
01:50:14,579 --> 01:50:22,979
photograph I've ever taken every ever

2461
01:50:17,909 --> 01:50:24,599
taken that's that's hard or I can see

2462
01:50:22,979 --> 01:50:26,789
the white drive sitting there by the

2463
01:50:24,600 --> 01:50:28,500
mouse and I just I can tell you if your

2464
01:50:26,789 --> 01:50:31,560
house is burning down 300 foot flames

2465
01:50:28,500 --> 01:50:33,779
propane tanks exploding wind blowing

2466
01:50:31,560 --> 01:50:36,060
orange flames into your face it is very

2467
01:50:33,779 --> 01:50:38,969
hard to decide what to pick up and run

2468
01:50:36,060 --> 01:50:41,039
with your life so you could have backed

2469
01:50:38,970 --> 01:50:43,650
that up right I'm not saying that I'm

2470
01:50:41,039 --> 01:50:45,630
not yeah I mean theoretically you could

2471
01:50:43,649 --> 01:50:48,000
have a backup at your sister's house or

2472
01:50:45,630 --> 01:50:50,100
so somewhere else and that's one thing

2473
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:52,409
you would have done looking back which

2474
01:50:50,100 --> 01:50:56,090
is again a lesson for all of us because

2475
01:50:52,409 --> 01:50:58,289
any of our houses can burn down and yeah

2476
01:50:56,090 --> 01:51:00,090
here's the big one though because we did

2477
01:50:58,289 --> 01:51:01,829
fifteen miles from my house something we

2478
01:51:00,090 --> 01:51:03,930
have over half a million seeds and 20 of

2479
01:51:01,829 --> 01:51:05,460
the mom's so we we plant it and the

2480
01:51:03,930 --> 01:51:07,320
other thing too is you don't always give

2481
01:51:05,460 --> 01:51:10,380
my mom's to all one people but here's my

2482
01:51:07,319 --> 01:51:12,158
biggest trick I really wish people that

2483
01:51:10,380 --> 01:51:14,800
live in this area one

2484
01:51:12,158 --> 01:51:17,198
as I screwed this up the three years ago

2485
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:18,730
we had a threat of fire and I didn't

2486
01:51:17,198 --> 01:51:19,960
worry about it that much and then some

2487
01:51:18,729 --> 01:51:21,939
people's houses burnt down and the

2488
01:51:19,960 --> 01:51:24,100
honors talked about it and I've talked

2489
01:51:21,939 --> 01:51:26,678
about a water catching systems for my

2490
01:51:24,100 --> 01:51:28,270
cannabis how would have been smart and

2491
01:51:26,679 --> 01:51:30,069
all these other things and I never I

2492
01:51:28,270 --> 01:51:32,260
never understood how serious wall tiles

2493
01:51:30,069 --> 01:51:34,359
are because I'm not from here and I

2494
01:51:32,260 --> 01:51:37,179
believe it should be mandatory to have a

2495
01:51:34,359 --> 01:51:38,738
couple of things my well is shared was

2496
01:51:37,179 --> 01:51:40,420
shared by my neighbor so we're talking

2497
01:51:38,738 --> 01:51:41,709
about a piece of 14-inch romex it goes

2498
01:51:40,420 --> 01:51:43,539
through the ground and comes to a pump

2499
01:51:41,710 --> 01:51:45,520
[ __ ] thing works and don't work half

2500
01:51:43,539 --> 01:51:47,380
the time the pump guys always coming up

2501
01:51:45,520 --> 01:51:48,520
there work on it if Peter no more than

2502
01:51:47,380 --> 01:51:51,819
three water hoses in my house you don't

2503
01:51:48,520 --> 01:51:53,920
have water pressure what was I thinking

2504
01:51:51,819 --> 01:51:55,599
we should have 20,000 gallon tank on the

2505
01:51:53,920 --> 01:51:57,609
top of my property with a valve that you

2506
01:51:55,600 --> 01:51:59,260
open up and it just dumps water I

2507
01:51:57,609 --> 01:52:01,779
should've had a sprinkler system on my

2508
01:51:59,260 --> 01:52:02,560
house I can afford this [ __ ] I grow weed

2509
01:52:01,779 --> 01:52:05,109
for a living

2510
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:07,030
I'm just stupid I didn't understand in

2511
01:52:05,109 --> 01:52:08,769
my house could burn to the ground and

2512
01:52:07,029 --> 01:52:10,658
burn cinder blocks and you're gonna show

2513
01:52:08,770 --> 01:52:12,730
this town I'm saying for $15,000 I could

2514
01:52:10,658 --> 01:52:14,049
have prevented this to five thousand

2515
01:52:12,729 --> 01:52:16,178
gallon tanks full of water a couple of

2516
01:52:14,050 --> 01:52:18,219
valves my property's uphill and downhill

2517
01:52:16,179 --> 01:52:20,289
so the water would run a gravity feed no

2518
01:52:18,219 --> 01:52:22,630
pumps required all I would had to do was

2519
01:52:20,289 --> 01:52:26,649
run up the hill and fill about and we're

2520
01:52:22,630 --> 01:52:28,480
done water said that fireman said it

2521
01:52:26,649 --> 01:52:31,569
wouldn't save my house what made the

2522
01:52:28,479 --> 01:52:34,000
house on fire was it from the roofer was

2523
01:52:31,569 --> 01:52:36,189
from the walls from the surrounding

2524
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:37,810
trees no there's no surrounding it

2525
01:52:36,189 --> 01:52:40,238
seriously I hate to be a dick but it's

2526
01:52:37,810 --> 01:52:49,120
75 mile an hour winds blowing fire into

2527
01:52:40,238 --> 01:52:53,379
the t1 1181 11 just caught on fire the

2528
01:52:49,119 --> 01:52:54,609
things we have seen everybody's heard

2529
01:52:53,380 --> 01:52:56,050
this story but if you got something

2530

2586
01:55:09,539 --> 01:55:16,899
363 on the corner of the houses birthday

2587
01:55:13,840 --> 01:55:20,800
and a pole of lightning struck it and so

2588
01:55:16,899 --> 01:55:22,809
we had a 400 foot tall blue flame that

2589
01:55:20,800 --> 01:55:25,510
could be seen for hundreds of miles

2590
01:55:22,810 --> 01:55:27,760
while we watched a half wear it down to

2591
01:55:25,510 --> 01:55:31,800
the river rocks and the basement and all

2592
01:55:27,760 --> 01:55:35,730
the while I only saw because there I was

2593

India when it happened

2594
01:55:36,020 --> 01:55:41,520

the trade medicine I think not just mom

2611
01:56:15,659 --> 01:56:19,680
at the bag but the fact that he had the

2612
01:56:17,430 --> 01:56:21,690
world I grab - I mean I grab - that's

2613
01:56:19,680 --> 01:56:24,180
what I got like idiot he grabbed

2614
01:56:21,689 --> 01:56:26,639
medicine for people you know I mean

2615
01:56:24,180 --> 01:56:31,070
seven hours the day before we I had

2616
01:56:26,640 --> 01:56:33,660

wanting to put something together and

2621
01:56:38,100 --> 01:56:40,410

2623
01:56:40,409 --> 01:56:44,609

that's Dinah I can already hear it I

2725
02:01:02,600 --> 02:01:07,640

2726
02:01:06,470 --> 02:01:10,970
boys are up there with French cheese

2727
02:01:07,640 --> 02:01:12,619
machine mark that's why the quiet very

2728
02:01:10,970 --> 02:01:16,460
well washing with his machine did this

2729
02:01:12,619 --> 02:01:19,579
machine's badass it the key to it is it

2730
02:01:16,460 --> 02:01:21,529
doesn't chop the weed and like I was

2731
02:01:19,579 --> 02:01:23,000
using them I used to sharp I sized to

2732
02:01:21,529 --> 02:01:24,920
believe you took a block ice and busted

2733
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:27,020
it with a hammer out there he's French

2734
02:01:24,920 --> 02:01:30,050
she says these surveys they plan

2735
02:01:27,020 --> 02:01:32,840
material you must not take it gently so

2736
02:01:30,050 --> 02:01:34,699
his idea is you spin the weed and the

2737
02:01:32,840 --> 02:01:38,810
ice in this big bucket it is but you do

2738
02:01:34,699 --> 02:01:40,460
it the bubble now does know it just

2741
02:01:41,689 --> 02:01:45,049
stainless steel unit I'm not trying to

2742
02:01:43,220 --> 02:01:52,670

2743

was cool under the moonlight we lost all

2754
02:02:17,720 --> 02:02:22,130
the footage and the coolest part was

2755
02:02:19,130 --> 02:02:24,260
talking with Camille when the movie like

2756
02:02:22,130 --> 02:02:27,949

02:02:24,260 --> 02:02:29,449
dude is gone but Frenchie dude Frenchie

2758
02:02:27,949 --> 02:02:30,679
stand there in the moonlight you know

2759
02:02:29,449 --> 02:02:32,000
him so I stand on a million line I've

2760
02:02:30,680 --> 02:02:34,010
got a straight picture on my Instagram

2761
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:36,439
with the lights from the garden put this

2762
02:02:34,010 --> 02:02:39,230
aura around him but he just comes down

2763
02:02:36,439 --> 02:02:41,839
in the garden he's like so cool you have

2764
02:02:39,229 --> 02:02:44,449
a much resin like [ __ ] thanks dude and

2765
02:02:41,840 --> 02:02:45,860
he's like it is so sticky it is hard to

2766
02:02:44,449 --> 02:02:47,569
work with and when Frenchie can only

2767
02:02:45,859 --> 02:02:51,279
tell your resin is hard to work with and

2768
02:02:47,569 --> 02:02:54,799
it's thick plus put it the book Howard

2769
02:02:51,279 --> 02:02:56,689
right yeah so and then bond came and we

2770
02:02:54,800 --> 02:03:00,409
watched hash for three days in a 6x6

2771
02:02:56,689 --> 02:03:02,750
gorilla tent and we made 82 grams of

2772
02:03:00,409 --> 02:03:05,149
beach sand that's what I left the place

2773
02:03:02,750 --> 02:03:07,909
with so all of the hash from the drop is

2774
02:03:05,149 --> 02:03:10,939
in people's hands cold as ice contract

2775
02:03:07,909 --> 02:03:14,180
concentrates has AB in French he has a

2776
02:03:10,939 --> 02:03:16,369
been four or five people of matte rice

2777
02:03:14,180 --> 02:03:17,750
has it been so I got sixty months under

2778
02:03:16,369 --> 02:03:21,590
my crop out there and turned it into

2779
02:03:17,750 --> 02:03:23,119
hash so at least I get to smoke my resin

2780
02:03:21,590 --> 02:03:25,430
at least I don't sit here and cry not

2781
02:03:23,119 --> 02:03:27,380
get this moment this is true this is

2782
02:03:25,430 --> 02:03:29,240
true but losing the footage you know you

2783
02:03:27,380 --> 02:03:31,100
can still like shed a tear at least

2784
02:03:29,239 --> 02:03:33,079
you're allowed I mean damn dude that

2785
02:03:31,100 --> 02:03:35,420
hurts I'm shedding tears for you and all

2786
02:03:33,079 --> 02:03:37,010
the people some of the stories were

2787
02:03:35,420 --> 02:03:39,230
incredible the girl that threw her dog

2788
02:03:37,010 --> 02:03:41,989
in her bag seventy pound dog and rode

2789
02:03:39,229 --> 02:03:45,109
out on the bicycle or a couple that hid

2790
02:03:41,989 --> 02:03:47,840
in the swimming pool incredible stuff

2791
02:03:45,109 --> 02:03:49,819
gave with Sonoma patient group and this

2792
02:03:47,840 --> 02:03:51,230
is not just not some great story like

2793
02:03:49,819 --> 02:03:52,789
the pool or anything like that when I

2794
02:03:51,229 --> 02:03:55,549
tell people I lost everything hey I got

2795
02:03:52,789 --> 02:03:57,949
my biker wallet I got my night man I had

2796
02:03:55,550 --> 02:03:59,840
a handful stuff Dave ran out in his

2797
02:03:57,949 --> 02:04:01,609
underwear through a flaming door

2798
02:03:59,840 --> 02:04:04,640
so in this man tells you he escaped with

2799
02:04:01,609 --> 02:04:06,139
his life he is for real he got burns and

2800
02:04:04,640 --> 02:04:08,539
he had to run through a flaming

2801
02:04:06,140 --> 02:04:11,030
bamboo screen and then kick up front

2802
02:04:08,539 --> 02:04:13,670
door open to get out in style so he he's

2803
02:04:11,029 --> 02:04:16,609
burned so that's pretty close right

2804
02:04:13,670 --> 02:04:18,140
there yeah for real even with your

2805
02:04:16,609 --> 02:04:20,009
underwears that's a whole other level

2806

2838
02:05:28,618 --> 02:05:31,109
Strawberry Cough snack he gave me the

2839

2840
02:05:31,109 --> 02:05:35,429
we make money on it he doesn't get

2841
02:05:32,189 --> 02:05:37,859
anything but it's a nice brotherly

2842
02:05:35,429 --> 02:05:40,429
people don't literally I would do it of

2843
02:05:37,859 --> 02:05:42,359

2844
02:05:40,429 --> 02:05:43,590
Jack's cleaners been offered to me by

2845
02:05:42,359 --> 02:05:49,768
the four people that have it within an

2846
02:05:43,590 --> 02:05:52,230
hour don't you have the Jack mark Jack

2847
02:05:49,769 --> 02:05:53,820
Jack the Ripper no don't you have my

2848
02:05:52,229 --> 02:05:56,250
jack cleaner f1 I thought bad boy gave

2849
02:05:53,819 --> 02:06:00,359
it to you which one

2850
02:05:56,250 --> 02:06:02,250
Jack's cleaner f1 no my mother oh I

2851
02:06:00,359 --> 02:06:05,038
thought you had it for a long time no I

2852
02:06:02,250 --> 02:06:07,828
got Jack's cleaner that sounds more like

2853
02:06:05,038 --> 02:06:16,469
bad boy yeah I thought he gave it to you

2854
02:06:07,828 --> 02:06:19,529
but I never gave anything genetics was

2855
02:06:16,469 --> 02:06:21,420
always rules no I can't get better way

2856
02:06:19,529 --> 02:06:23,719
when I got stuff I just gave it away I

2857
02:06:21,420 --> 02:06:26,819
was like here you have everything

2858
02:06:23,719 --> 02:06:28,408
because I just thought that it would be

2859
02:06:26,819 --> 02:06:29,880
better for people to have things that

2860
02:06:28,408 --> 02:06:31,250
not have things that way if you know

2861
02:06:29,880 --> 02:06:35,739
something happens and you lose

2862
02:06:31,250 --> 02:06:38,600
it's you know the vault is the people

2863
02:06:35,739 --> 02:06:40,099
the Romulan the Joe Pyne Romulan didn't

2864
02:06:38,600 --> 02:06:42,320
get lost and that's because two people

2865
02:06:40,100 --> 02:06:44,510
have it that's just straight I didn't

2866
02:06:42,319 --> 02:06:45,229
know I was like I didn t have it and

2867
02:06:44,510 --> 02:06:46,880
they're like oh yeah

2868
02:06:45,229 --> 02:06:54,769
you gave it to me five years I haven't

2869
02:06:46,880 --> 02:06:59,900
seen the Romulan in years yeah I always

2870
02:06:54,770 --> 02:07:01,850
loved the jacks cleaner but I think that

2871
02:06:59,899 --> 02:07:03,799
it's part of prohibition where if you

2872
02:07:01,850 --> 02:07:05,450
can be the only one that has it and then

2873
02:07:03,800 --> 02:07:07,279
you put it out and then people are

2874
02:07:05,449 --> 02:07:09,829
buying those it's like it's unfortunate

2875
02:07:07,279 --> 02:07:11,779
my my mentality is I learn and meet

2876
02:07:09,829 --> 02:07:13,850
people like Forrest I always tell people

2877
02:07:11,779 --> 02:07:15,679
I'm like what are you worried that some

2878
02:07:13,850 --> 02:07:17,450
poor child is gonna find this as a

2879
02:07:15,680 --> 02:07:19,159
medicine and stop and it's gonna

2880
02:07:17,449 --> 02:07:21,500
alleviate a massive amount of suffering

2881
02:07:19,159 --> 02:07:24,829
no I wasn't even thinking about that I'm

2882
02:07:21,500 --> 02:07:26,930
like exactly that's your problem what

2883
02:07:24,829 --> 02:07:28,670
you're thinking about is Oh some other

2884
02:07:26,930 --> 02:07:30,079
guys are gonna ruin this this this

2885
02:07:28,670 --> 02:07:31,159
cultivar because they're not gonna grow

2886
02:07:30,079 --> 02:07:33,050
it as good as me and they're gonna give

2887
02:07:31,159 --> 02:07:34,399
it a bad name and or worse they're gonna

2888
02:07:33,050 --> 02:07:35,600
grow up better than me and I'm not gonna

2889
02:07:34,399 --> 02:07:38,689
be able to sell the [ __ ] that I'm

2890
02:07:35,600 --> 02:07:41,060
growing both the wrong the wrong like

2891
02:07:38,689 --> 02:07:48,139
the fear and starseed passive basic

2892
02:07:41,060 --> 02:07:50,240
nature of man let's you know that's part

2893
02:07:48,140 --> 02:07:51,770
of weight story my harlequin known to so

2894
02:07:50,239 --> 02:07:55,189
many people is back it was giving it

2895
02:07:51,770 --> 02:07:58,520
away but I will say it's a public I'd be

2896
02:07:55,189 --> 02:08:00,439
happy to you know be a bank for some of

2897
02:07:58,520 --> 02:08:02,420
you guys in these rare strange you know

2898
02:08:00,439 --> 02:08:03,559
just to the public service you don't

2899
02:08:02,420 --> 02:08:05,359
want to be there for you

2900
02:08:03,560 --> 02:08:09,490
plaid dress network be happy to store

2901
02:08:05,359 --> 02:08:09,489
them so that you have a have a backup

2902
02:08:10,789 --> 02:08:14,210
that's an awesome offer because the

2903
02:08:12,380 --> 02:08:16,310
khalad rest network its high integrity

2904
02:08:14,210 --> 02:08:19,699
you know it's like forest isn't gonna go

2905
02:08:16,310 --> 02:08:21,200
start a seed bank in Amsterdam no so

2906
02:08:19,699 --> 02:08:24,349
then you know that those are hearers

2907
02:08:21,199 --> 02:08:26,809
they may be getting to the unfortunately

2908
02:08:24,350 --> 02:08:29,510
unfortunately mark this technology and

2909
02:08:26,810 --> 02:08:30,950
this availability is just a wrap I mean

2910
02:08:29,510 --> 02:08:33,199
you know somebody like for so I have

2911
02:08:30,949 --> 02:08:35,689
friends Jason with Athena seed bank he's

2912
02:08:33,199 --> 02:08:37,550
got whatever a million plants or

2913
02:08:35,689 --> 02:08:38,839
whatever these guys can do that but up

2914
02:08:37,550 --> 02:08:39,860
until about a year ago and you and you

2915
02:08:38,840 --> 02:08:41,390
talked about this and I'm not

2916
02:08:39,859 --> 02:08:44,179
contradicting or anything

2917
02:08:41,390 --> 02:08:47,060
you know as a breeder or right now it's

2918
02:08:44,180 --> 02:08:48,409
it's a new world so trademark patent it

2919
02:08:47,060 --> 02:08:49,610
in protection I'm not talking about

2920
02:08:48,409 --> 02:08:51,500
medicine because you knows guys I'll

2921
02:08:49,609 --> 02:08:54,949
give anybody the shirt off my back but I

2922
02:08:51,500 --> 02:08:56,090
mean I've some six seed companies myself

2923
02:08:54,949 --> 02:08:57,859
that aren't mine

2924
02:08:56,090 --> 02:08:58,970
so yeah you there definitely is

2925
02:08:57,859 --> 02:08:59,869
intellectual property that we have to

2926
02:08:58,970 --> 02:09:02,630
worry about but I want to get into

2927
02:08:59,869 --> 02:09:05,630
something that's cool so while a strain

2928
02:09:02,630 --> 02:09:07,010
like cheese cannot be trademarked or

2929
02:09:05,630 --> 02:09:08,779
patented I don't know if you guys know

2930
02:09:07,010 --> 02:09:11,630
this I spent a lot of money to find this

2931
02:09:08,779 --> 02:09:13,369
out or like say Chernobyl that I created

2932
02:09:11,630 --> 02:09:16,010
cannot be patented or something maybe

2933
02:09:13,369 --> 02:09:18,500
the bubble man cannot be bad because in

2934
02:09:16,010 --> 02:09:20,090
the public domain let's say forest grows

2935
02:09:18,500 --> 02:09:21,590
out a and I'm not going to use one of

2936
02:09:20,090 --> 02:09:25,670
mine let's say forest grows out ring

2937
02:09:21,590 --> 02:09:29,750
goes gift and he finds a cut of Ringo's

2938
02:09:25,670 --> 02:09:32,149
gift that's 23 24 % CBD it had some THC

2939
02:09:29,750 --> 02:09:35,810
V in it it had these combinations and

2940
02:09:32,149 --> 02:09:37,729
that particular plant made it was

2941
02:09:35,810 --> 02:09:41,240
special special because of that content

2942
02:09:37,729 --> 02:09:43,279
that plant can be protected and that's

2943
02:09:41,239 --> 02:09:45,079
going to happen nowadays because that

2944
02:09:43,279 --> 02:09:46,340
plant needs to become medicine so if you

2945
02:09:45,079 --> 02:09:51,409
had something it was twenty three two

2946
02:09:46,340 --> 02:09:53,600
one and high CBD high tea a CV you would

2947
02:09:51,409 --> 02:09:57,399
want that to become medicine and then as

2948
02:09:53,600 --> 02:09:59,870
a company you want to make sure that the

2949
02:09:57,399 --> 02:10:02,569
product that's in that box that goes to

2950
02:09:59,869 --> 02:10:04,039
a patient is proper so the reason you

2951
02:10:02,569 --> 02:10:05,779
have to have trademarks and protection

2952
02:10:04,039 --> 02:10:07,760
and I know I'm pissing people off it's

2953
02:10:05,779 --> 02:10:11,989
because unscrupulous people will take

2954
02:10:07,760 --> 02:10:14,449
the same name the same box and not the

2955
02:10:11,989 --> 02:10:17,119
same product inside of sell it to people

2956
02:10:14,449 --> 02:10:18,710
of course it's just part of

2957
02:10:17,119 --> 02:10:22,159
understanding the business but that's

2958
02:10:18,710 --> 02:10:24,230
all we have something that works right

2959
02:10:22,159 --> 02:10:26,869
that's also I don't think that because

2960
02:10:24,229 --> 02:10:30,229
chimeras about this in the room as well

2961
02:10:26,869 --> 02:10:32,809
and and I think that breeding will be

2962
02:10:30,229 --> 02:10:34,429
done to specifically find those those

2963
02:10:32,810 --> 02:10:36,590
numbers I don't think they're gonna be I

2964
02:10:34,430 --> 02:10:39,440
don't think as many will be accidentally

2965
02:10:36,590 --> 02:10:41,150
popped and random pegs that are all in

2966
02:10:39,439 --> 02:10:42,859
the open domain I think it'll take like

2967
02:10:41,149 --> 02:10:46,639
pretty intense like reading to create

2968
02:10:42,859 --> 02:10:48,500
specific cannabinoid profiles monoid

2969
02:10:46,640 --> 02:10:51,350
profiles

2970
02:10:48,500 --> 02:10:55,960
yeah check your mics heads together Mike

2971
02:10:51,350 --> 02:11:00,470
bad echo there I heard it I heard it I

2972
02:10:55,960 --> 02:11:06,170
hear it well I want to throw in here for

2973
02:11:00,470 --> 02:11:11,230
a second that I really think that the

2974
02:11:06,170 --> 02:11:14,539
idea of being able to identify specific

2975
02:11:11,229 --> 02:11:17,119
medicines as being from specific plants

2976
02:11:14,539 --> 02:11:19,340
is coming with the analytical testing

2977
02:11:17,119 --> 02:11:21,649
regimen that's going to be in place at

2978
02:11:19,340 --> 02:11:23,630
least in California and I assume that's

2979
02:11:21,649 --> 02:11:25,159
happening in Washington and Colorado and

2980
02:11:23,630 --> 02:11:27,140
whatnot that there's a certain amount of

2981
02:11:25,159 --> 02:11:30,369
standardization we're coming to

2982
02:11:27,140 --> 02:11:33,140
understand what cheese or Chernobyl

2983
02:11:30,369 --> 02:11:39,559
looks like when it comes from the

2984
02:11:33,140 --> 02:11:42,440
analytical labs but I I'm really a fan

2985
02:11:39,560 --> 02:11:45,260
of the idea that cannabis should be an

2986
02:11:42,439 --> 02:11:50,779
open source thing man

2987
02:11:45,260 --> 02:11:56,030
it's prohibition has created a an

2988
02:11:50,779 --> 02:11:59,300
artificial market if you will and the

2989
02:11:56,029 --> 02:12:01,429
plant doesn't deserve prohibition

2990
02:11:59,300 --> 02:12:03,289
it's a remarkable plant we all know that

2991
02:12:01,430 --> 02:12:05,990
I know I'm preaching to the choir here

2992
02:12:03,289 --> 02:12:08,090
but it must be said that the plants

2993
02:12:05,989 --> 02:12:12,170
really doing the hard part and it's it's

2994
02:12:08,090 --> 02:12:15,079
like humans to try and keep an exclusive

2995
02:12:12,170 --> 02:12:18,289
thing on it to turn it into a

2996
02:12:15,079 --> 02:12:20,000
profit-making thing and there's nothing

2997
02:12:18,289 --> 02:12:23,680
wrong with making a living from what we

2998
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:28,539
do but I think it's really essential

2999
02:12:23,680 --> 02:12:31,520
when like if forced were to find a

3000
02:12:28,539 --> 02:12:33,649
specific cut of a seedling line that

3001
02:12:31,520 --> 02:12:35,450
we're working with that turns out to be

3002
02:12:33,649 --> 02:12:37,729
something spectacular that's really

3003
02:12:35,449 --> 02:12:40,220
needed by a wide range of people for a

3004
02:12:37,729 --> 02:12:43,549
wide range of conditions it would be

3005
02:12:40,220 --> 02:12:45,560
wrong to me and again I don't want to I

3006
02:12:43,550 --> 02:12:47,659
guess I'm putting the value judgement on

3007
02:12:45,560 --> 02:12:51,560
it but it would be wrong to try and hold

3008
02:12:47,659 --> 02:12:54,409
that and make people pay for access to

3009
02:12:51,560 --> 02:12:56,539
it the plants doing the hard part all

3010
02:12:54,409 --> 02:12:59,119
we're doing is identifying those plants

3011
02:12:56,539 --> 02:13:02,210
and then taking care of them in a way

3012
02:12:59,119 --> 02:13:05,569
that allows them to be made in

3013
02:13:02,210 --> 02:13:09,829
that's really my point I knew that's not

3014
02:13:05,569 --> 02:13:14,029
quite exactly true some varieties are

3015
02:13:09,829 --> 02:13:17,029
bred for specific no inter peen contents

3016
02:13:14,029 --> 02:13:20,119
and it can be a two three four year

3017
02:13:17,029 --> 02:13:22,909
process involving a lot of money a lot

3018
02:13:20,119 --> 02:13:26,149
of growing a lot of research with a

3019
02:13:22,909 --> 02:13:29,510
laboratory so it can be a very expensive

3020
02:13:26,149 --> 02:13:32,210
process and the people who do that

3021
02:13:29,510 --> 02:13:34,520
shouldn't be discouraged from doing it

3022
02:13:32,210 --> 02:13:37,340
they should be encouraged don't we want

3023
02:13:34,520 --> 02:13:39,920
to find out more about cannabis don't we

3024
02:13:37,340 --> 02:13:44,329
want more sophisticated breeding instead

3025
02:13:39,920 --> 02:13:45,500
of less sophisticated I do I can see

3026
02:13:44,329 --> 02:13:47,180
both sides of it and they're just

3027
02:13:45,500 --> 02:13:48,619
different sides it's like when you come

3028
02:13:47,180 --> 02:13:50,390
from one side of it and what you're

3029
02:13:48,619 --> 02:13:52,750
doing it's like yeah that's open source

3030
02:13:50,390 --> 02:13:56,300
for sure but then I also understand

3031
02:13:52,750 --> 02:13:59,930
someone's spending I gotta meet your

3032
02:13:56,300 --> 02:14:02,720
guys echo there we go I think it was

3033
02:13:59,930 --> 02:14:05,119
Wade's I also understand the spending

3034
02:14:02,720 --> 02:14:08,780
money on lab technicians and machinery

3035
02:14:05,119 --> 02:14:11,479
and testing and greenhouses and people

3036
02:14:08,779 --> 02:14:14,149
to work in those greenhouses and the

3037
02:14:11,479 --> 02:14:17,389
years of work that can be that can be

3038
02:14:14,149 --> 02:14:19,849
done to actually produce a plant that is

3039
02:14:17,390 --> 02:14:21,619
that is unique in that sense I see both

3040
02:14:19,850 --> 02:14:23,240
sides I mean I sit with Wade in the

3041
02:14:21,619 --> 02:14:25,699
sense like yeah really I love the

3042
02:14:23,239 --> 02:14:27,829
utopian version of it should not be held

3043
02:14:25,699 --> 02:14:30,889
over people's heads but at the same time

3044
02:14:27,829 --> 02:14:32,630
in every other aspect of life there's

3045
02:14:30,890 --> 02:14:34,579
it's hard to like it you would be

3046
02:14:32,630 --> 02:14:35,989
discouraged in business if you were just

3047
02:14:34,579 --> 02:14:37,220
like yeah by the way after you spend

3048
02:14:35,989 --> 02:14:39,469
this millions of dollars of your own

3049
02:14:37,220 --> 02:14:41,270
money sell find everything you're not

3050
02:14:39,470 --> 02:14:43,280
getting paid back because you know you

3051
02:14:41,270 --> 02:14:48,830
shouldn't really be able to profit from

3052
02:14:43,279 --> 02:14:54,380
this it's a tough I see both sides but

3053
02:14:48,829 --> 02:14:57,760
maybe both need to be both nonprofit and

3054
02:14:54,380 --> 02:15:02,989
for-profit because unfortunately

3055
02:14:57,760 --> 02:15:07,460
nonprofit will not drive the industry as

3056
02:15:02,989 --> 02:15:09,739
quickly or as open as for-profit and I

3057
02:15:07,460 --> 02:15:12,170
have nothing against people profiting

3058
02:15:09,739 --> 02:15:15,069
from cannabis I prefer they didn't do it

3059
02:15:12,170 --> 02:15:17,899
with from people who need medicine but

3060
02:15:15,069 --> 02:15:21,590
except for that for recreational which

3061
02:15:17,899 --> 02:15:23,299
is the majority of cannabis use I see

3062
02:15:21,590 --> 02:15:26,060
nothing wrong with people making a

3063
02:15:23,300 --> 02:15:28,820
profit I think in the future that profit

3064
02:15:26,060 --> 02:15:32,300
would be a lot smaller but yeah we

3065
02:15:28,819 --> 02:15:34,939
haven't gotten there yet I don't know it

3066
02:15:32,300 --> 02:15:38,000
just reminds me of kind of like it's

3067
02:15:34,939 --> 02:15:39,710
it's just hard to hard to really put

3068
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:41,359
your thumb on it exactly but there's

3069
02:15:39,710 --> 02:15:43,340
there's there's something there's

3070
02:15:41,359 --> 02:15:46,569
something in that dialogue for sure Wade

3071
02:15:43,340 --> 02:15:49,909
there's something to be more disgusting

3072
02:15:46,569 --> 02:15:56,029
yes I want to totally agree with what

3073
02:15:49,909 --> 02:15:59,210
Sam said I I guess for me it really has

3074
02:15:56,029 --> 02:16:02,750
to do with if that plant is providing

3075
02:15:59,210 --> 02:16:07,279
something that a family or an individual

3076
02:16:02,750 --> 02:16:11,300
needs for their life it seems wrong to

3077
02:16:07,279 --> 02:16:14,529
make them pay especially a lot for the

3078
02:16:11,300 --> 02:16:19,279
opportunity to have access to it whereas

3079
02:16:14,529 --> 02:16:22,659
we all know that cannabis has many

3080
02:16:19,279 --> 02:16:25,399
expressions that people really enjoy

3081
02:16:22,659 --> 02:16:29,119
enough and aren't in a situation where

3082
02:16:25,399 --> 02:16:31,489
they have to have it where there's room

3083
02:16:29,119 --> 02:16:34,159
for folks that have discretionary income

3084
02:16:31,489 --> 02:16:36,860
by the time someone's catastrophic lis

3085
02:16:34,159 --> 02:16:41,270
ill typically their family has no money

3086
02:16:36,860 --> 02:16:43,579
left and then to ask them to pay out of

3087
02:16:41,270 --> 02:16:46,700
pocket large amounts of money in order

3088
02:16:43,579 --> 02:16:51,049
to have access to medicine that can help

3089
02:16:46,700 --> 02:16:53,510
their child is yeah that's where it gets

3090
02:16:51,049 --> 02:16:55,340
hard for me that's all I'm saying

3091
02:16:53,510 --> 02:17:00,170
and I think there's a lot of room as Sam

3092
02:16:55,340 --> 02:17:02,179
said Sam nailed it so I'll shut up you

3093
02:17:00,170 --> 02:17:03,679
know we're not gonna have to reinvent

3094
02:17:02,179 --> 02:17:06,500
the wheel here I think a lot of times

3095
02:17:03,679 --> 02:17:08,299
with cannabis we walk into it like these

3096
02:17:06,500 --> 02:17:12,500
questions haven't been asked before but

3097
02:17:08,299 --> 02:17:14,659
you know cultivar rights and proprietary

3098
02:17:12,500 --> 02:17:17,569
rights isn't a new thing people do it

3099
02:17:14,659 --> 02:17:19,309
with melons and tomatoes and all sorts

3100
02:17:17,569 --> 02:17:20,659
of other things and there's a law there

3101
02:17:19,309 --> 02:17:23,000
that people can look at I'm not going to

3102
02:17:20,659 --> 02:17:25,129
pretend to be an expert in it but it's

3103
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:28,340
just hard they fight that today with

3104
02:17:25,129 --> 02:17:29,079
certain melon varieties right but it's

3105
02:17:28,340 --> 02:17:32,139
hard to say

3106
02:17:29,079 --> 02:17:33,638
and hold it at the same time because you

3107
02:17:32,138 --> 02:17:35,559
know what do people do they breed that

3108
02:17:33,638 --> 02:17:36,879
melon a couple times they breed it with

3109
02:17:35,559 --> 02:17:38,170
another melon it's a little bit

3110
02:17:36,879 --> 02:17:40,959
different and then they name it

3111
02:17:38,170 --> 02:17:42,399
their new melon you know so it's kind of

3112
02:17:40,959 --> 02:17:43,959
it's one of those double-edged swords

3113
02:17:42,399 --> 02:17:46,329
where yeah a lot of work goes into it

3114
02:17:43,959 --> 02:17:49,899
but the plants not going it's only going

3115
02:17:46,329 --> 02:17:53,409
to allow us to own it so much so you

3116
02:17:49,899 --> 02:17:54,968
know I think that it's hard you know but

3117
02:17:53,409 --> 02:17:58,270
I think the only real way to keep us

3118
02:17:54,968 --> 02:18:01,000
trained yourself is to just not let it

3119
02:17:58,270 --> 02:18:02,829
out anywhere and make a single singular

3120
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:05,409
product out of it and you know that's

3121
02:18:02,829 --> 02:18:07,120
what the big boys do right GW

3122
02:18:05,409 --> 02:18:08,619
Pharmaceuticals has a couple strains

3123
02:18:07,120 --> 02:18:10,840
that I would kill to get my hands on

3124
02:18:08,620 --> 02:18:14,050
yeah but they're not gonna let it out

3125
02:18:10,840 --> 02:18:16,360
you know and that's where I hope that we

3126
02:18:14,049 --> 02:18:19,388
find a good balance in between those two

3127
02:18:16,360 --> 02:18:20,739
because there's like has been said over

3128
02:18:19,388 --> 02:18:22,119
and over again it's there's just that

3129
02:18:20,739 --> 02:18:25,090
balance between the work and the money

3130
02:18:22,120 --> 02:18:29,290
put in and the right to profit from your

3131
02:18:25,090 --> 02:18:31,030
hard work and the point where if you the

3132
02:18:29,290 --> 02:18:33,700
only way to really control it is is

3133
02:18:31,030 --> 02:18:36,460
gonna be in a way that really limits the

3134
02:18:33,700 --> 02:18:39,670
amount of people who can have access to

3135
02:18:36,459 --> 02:18:41,468
it there's such a degree that almost you

3136
02:18:39,670 --> 02:18:43,120
know no one can well if you look at the

3137
02:18:41,468 --> 02:18:45,369
big numbers in the big picture and the

3138
02:18:43,120 --> 02:18:48,429
whole you know country and world and

3139
02:18:45,370 --> 02:18:52,270
planet etc so what do you need W strains

3140
02:18:48,429 --> 02:18:54,760
for something I need GW strains I just

3141
02:18:52,270 --> 02:18:58,030
know they have strains that I can't find

3142
02:18:54,760 --> 02:19:01,000
at the moment on the in the open market

3143
02:18:58,030 --> 02:19:04,329
that are just really very specific

3144
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:07,209
cannabinoid interpreting program Sam

3145
02:19:04,329 --> 02:19:12,610
game yes

3146
02:19:07,209 --> 02:19:16,809
dr. Russo spoke about knowing that GW

3147
02:19:12,610 --> 02:19:21,760
had cultivars that were producing 15 and

3148
02:19:16,809 --> 02:19:31,119
20% of CBC for example as well as THC V

3149
02:19:21,760 --> 02:19:32,500
and CBD V was this spring with specific

3150
02:19:31,120 --> 02:19:34,000
well I mean yeah they're out there

3151
02:19:32,500 --> 02:19:37,690
everywhere I just use that as an example

3152
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:39,459
of someone who has a or the company that

3153
02:19:37,690 --> 02:19:42,190
has some really uncommon strains I think

3154
02:19:39,459 --> 02:19:42,939
the one that dr. Russo mentioned I was

3155
02:19:42,190 --> 02:19:46,870
at that

3156
02:19:42,940 --> 02:19:48,909
sure it was high in CBC and CBD and then

3157
02:19:46,870 --> 02:19:51,990
what also made it really unique is

3158
02:19:48,909 --> 02:19:54,970
really high in the terpene leno lool so

3159
02:19:51,989 --> 02:19:56,890
for someone who's an antispasmodic sort

3160
02:19:54,970 --> 02:19:58,841
of always got my eyes out for the

3161
02:19:56,890 --> 02:20:01,449
compounds that have pharmacological

3162
02:19:58,841 --> 02:20:04,319
effects in that direction my ears perk

3163
02:20:01,450 --> 02:20:06,761
up with those sort of things for sure

3164
02:20:04,319 --> 02:20:08,171
but you know they it's not gonna get out

3165
02:20:06,761 --> 02:20:09,790
because they know that you know it's

3166
02:20:08,171 --> 02:20:11,950
either either you have it or it's out

3167
02:20:09,790 --> 02:20:13,450
you know I don't see how we're

3168
02:20:11,950 --> 02:20:14,860
struggling with how to control that in

3169
02:20:13,450 --> 02:20:16,500
between but you know I don't know if

3170
02:20:14,860 --> 02:20:19,271
there is a perfect solution for that

3171
02:20:16,500 --> 02:20:22,959
well if you look at the cut flower

3172
02:20:19,271 --> 02:20:25,989
industry what they do is for example you

3173
02:20:22,959 --> 02:20:31,149
breed a new rose you release it it's

3174
02:20:25,989 --> 02:20:35,199
mass-produced in Kenya Colombia several

3175
02:20:31,149 --> 02:20:38,199
other tropical countries and you get

3176
02:20:35,200 --> 02:20:41,021
royalties on it to the breeder so that

3177
02:20:38,200 --> 02:20:45,280
there's a standardized way of working

3178
02:20:41,021 --> 02:20:47,591
with with trees flowers vegetables there

3179
02:20:45,280 --> 02:20:49,870
is with cannabis - it's just not legal

3180
02:20:47,591 --> 02:20:51,909
in America yet and if they're doing it

3181
02:20:49,870 --> 02:20:55,511
with roses then obviously it's not some

3182
02:20:51,909 --> 02:20:58,690
huge like 800 percent interest for the

3183
02:20:55,511 --> 02:21:02,381
genetics it's just a small little it's a

3184
02:20:58,690 --> 02:21:04,569
royalty-free pea right you see the clone

3185
02:21:02,380 --> 02:21:08,739
or the dried material or the whatever

3186
02:21:04,569 --> 02:21:10,810
right so it didn't crush the flower

3187
02:21:08,739 --> 02:21:12,399
industry I'm sure as long as those

3188
02:21:10,810 --> 02:21:13,959
royalties are kept reasonable it

3189
02:21:12,399 --> 02:21:18,880
probably won't crush the cannabis

3190
02:21:13,959 --> 02:21:20,890
industry I mean already in my opinion

3191
02:21:18,880 --> 02:21:23,709
prohibition prices and the continuation

3192
02:21:20,890 --> 02:21:25,779
of prohibition prices right into the

3193
02:21:23,709 --> 02:21:28,600
civil disobedient dispensaries and then

3194
02:21:25,780 --> 02:21:30,311
right into the licensed producers the

3195
02:21:28,601 --> 02:21:32,950
prices just never changed they've

3196
02:21:30,310 --> 02:21:34,630
maintained the same price from when it

3197
02:21:32,950 --> 02:21:37,540
was totally illegal and we were being

3198
02:21:34,630 --> 02:21:38,949
jailed - hey now you can do it but guess

3199
02:21:37,540 --> 02:21:41,650
what we're not [ __ ] making it any

3200
02:21:38,950 --> 02:21:44,921
cheaper we want to [ __ ] get you know

3201
02:21:41,649 --> 02:21:46,779
LPS like some LPS sell herb for five

3202
02:21:44,921 --> 02:21:50,351
bucks a gram which is like the great

3203
02:21:46,780 --> 02:21:53,440
deal but that's still like over two

3204
02:21:50,351 --> 02:21:55,721
thousand dollars a pound for something

3205
02:21:53,440 --> 02:21:56,710
like you know that probably doesn't cost

3206
02:21:55,720 --> 02:21:59,529
anywhere near two

3207
02:21:56,709 --> 02:22:01,569
six row and it's gonna crash the small

3208
02:21:59,530 --> 02:22:03,820
farmer you know because really just

3209
02:22:01,569 --> 02:22:06,639
gonna need a ton of money to participate

3210
02:22:03,819 --> 02:22:08,529
in the artificially inflated market yeah

3211
02:22:06,639 --> 02:22:10,449
and you know we see him panicking and

3212
02:22:08,530 --> 02:22:15,130
rightfully so here in Northern

3213
02:22:10,450 --> 02:22:18,760
California it's the market that has

3214
02:22:15,129 --> 02:22:20,049
existed for the last 30 40 years was

3215
02:22:18,760 --> 02:22:22,270
never real

3216
02:22:20,049 --> 02:22:25,269
it was always artificial based on

3217
02:22:22,270 --> 02:22:28,329
prohibition without the risk there

3218
02:22:25,270 --> 02:22:30,640
shouldn't be the reward but quite

3219
02:22:28,329 --> 02:22:32,200
frankly right and they're building tax

3220
02:22:30,639 --> 02:22:34,689
structures this is part of my platform

3221
02:22:32,200 --> 02:22:36,280
with the clad Reese Network a lot of it

3222
02:22:34,690 --> 02:22:37,659
started because I looked at the tax

3223
02:22:36,280 --> 02:22:40,210
structures they're building and they're

3224
02:22:37,659 --> 02:22:42,340
built off of prohibition and prohibition

3225
02:22:40,209 --> 02:22:45,399
prices which aren't anyone especially I

3226
02:22:42,340 --> 02:22:47,228
would think congressmen and women would

3227
02:22:45,399 --> 02:22:49,119
understand have taken some economics

3228
02:22:47,228 --> 02:22:51,369
classes anyone who's taken you know your

3229
02:22:49,120 --> 02:22:53,410
basic economics class knows that it's

3230
02:22:51,370 --> 02:22:55,570
the the marketplace they're building

3231
02:22:53,409 --> 02:22:58,059
this infrastructure off of it's not

3232
02:22:55,569 --> 02:23:01,059
going to exist as soon as prohibition

3233
02:22:58,059 --> 02:23:02,350
ends nationwide at least the way the

3234
02:23:01,059 --> 02:23:03,939
United States work I think it's

3235
02:23:02,350 --> 02:23:06,250
artificially people say well look at

3236
02:23:03,940 --> 02:23:07,390
Colorado and others and how it is well

3237
02:23:06,250 --> 02:23:09,579
yeah well they're surrounded by

3238
02:23:07,389 --> 02:23:12,189
prohibition and in that market it's

3239
02:23:09,579 --> 02:23:14,440
going to be impacted by the prices

3240
02:23:12,190 --> 02:23:17,920
around them and the necessity around

3241
02:23:14,440 --> 02:23:20,649
them but you know what we have now is

3242
02:23:17,920 --> 02:23:22,719
just a system that's being written and

3243
02:23:20,649 --> 02:23:25,239
directed based off of prices that don't

3244
02:23:22,719 --> 02:23:27,099
even exist anymore let alone you know

3245
02:23:25,239 --> 02:23:31,930
going to exist in the future

3246
02:23:27,100 --> 02:23:33,819
and it's that and there's no in most

3247
02:23:31,930 --> 02:23:36,819
know how it's going in Canada but in

3248
02:23:33,819 --> 02:23:38,920
most there's no thought whatsoever being

3249
02:23:36,819 --> 02:23:41,590
put in the cannabis that's being grown

3250
02:23:38,920 --> 02:23:43,540
to not sell so not only is it the sales

3251
02:23:41,590 --> 02:23:46,260
numbers completely off based on

3252
02:23:43,540 --> 02:23:48,880
prohibition but there's absolutely no

3253
02:23:46,260 --> 02:23:51,690
sort of charitable work written into any

3254
02:23:48,879 --> 02:23:54,339
of the laws so essentially what puts

3255
02:23:51,690 --> 02:23:56,170
places like the classiest Network from I

3256
02:23:54,340 --> 02:23:59,290
would say out of business but out from

3257
02:23:56,170 --> 02:24:01,030
being able to run is the tax structure

3258
02:23:59,290 --> 02:24:03,220
in requirements that are being written

3259
02:24:01,030 --> 02:24:05,460
in how it's being written more than

3260
02:24:03,219 --> 02:24:05,459
anything

3261
02:24:08,320 --> 02:24:14,210
hmm well said thank you Forrest I'm just

3262
02:24:11,630 --> 02:24:17,120
found a bag of Johnny bees on earth and

3263
02:24:14,210 --> 02:24:18,890
I've decided that I'm going to squish

3264
02:24:17,120 --> 02:24:20,479
whatever this is I think it's like five

3265
02:24:18,890 --> 02:24:23,060
or six grams I just need to hit some

3266
02:24:20,479 --> 02:24:25,751
medicos Ross and while I uh well I

3267
02:24:23,060 --> 02:24:29,960
listen to the great conversation and

3268
02:24:25,751 --> 02:24:32,541
sometimes jump in and be a part of it so

3269
02:24:29,960 --> 02:24:35,530
yeah if anybody wants to back to that

3270
02:24:32,540 --> 02:24:38,350
mystery strains you see any of those hi

3271
02:24:35,531 --> 02:24:43,661
CBC hi

3272
02:24:38,351 --> 02:24:47,721
CBC little bounce of THC and see see see

3273
02:24:43,661 --> 02:24:51,620
CBC is tough to produce in normal plants

3274
02:24:47,720 --> 02:24:56,870
yeah they they do it by using a special

3275
02:24:51,620 --> 02:25:01,550
variety which I found which has what's

3276
02:24:56,870 --> 02:25:03,500
called juvenile it it stays in a

3277
02:25:01,550 --> 02:25:06,260
juvenile state instead of fully

3278
02:25:03,501 --> 02:25:09,261
flowering and it produces more CBC in

3279
02:25:06,261 --> 02:25:12,261
that state but it does as a full flower

3280
02:25:09,261 --> 02:25:14,421
plant that's what they have as far as

3281
02:25:12,261 --> 02:25:15,861
their CBG varieties as well correct

3282
02:25:14,421 --> 02:25:17,421
because I know G divided from the

3283
02:25:15,861 --> 02:25:19,341
student clothes has some basically

3284
02:25:17,421 --> 02:25:21,140
genetic fluke type plants to just

3285
02:25:19,341 --> 02:25:22,841
produce CBD like it doesn't trigger the

3286
02:25:21,140 --> 02:25:28,091
next phase to produce other cannabinoids

3287
02:25:22,841 --> 02:25:28,091
it's lacking the next synthesis correct

3288
02:25:28,751 --> 02:25:36,979
so Sam a specific question would would

3289
02:25:33,861 --> 02:25:41,601
one be more likely to find C BC and CB G

3290
02:25:36,979 --> 02:25:44,120
in abundance in in genetics that took a

3291
02:25:41,601 --> 02:25:51,440
long time to finish or never finished

3292
02:25:44,120 --> 02:25:55,040
flowering I don't think so I found one

3293
02:25:51,440 --> 02:25:57,411
and it was just different and I felt it

3294
02:25:55,040 --> 02:26:00,500
and I saved it for a couple of years and

3295
02:25:57,411 --> 02:26:05,120
then we tested it found out it was at

3296
02:26:00,501 --> 02:26:10,820
CBC and that small amounts and then GW

3297
02:26:05,120 --> 02:26:14,960
through with my breeder found that the

3298
02:26:10,820 --> 02:26:17,950
juvenile flowering recessive genes were

3299
02:26:14,960 --> 02:26:20,529
also making the percentage even higher

3300
02:26:17,950 --> 02:26:25,780
so they they create a varieties that

3301
02:26:20,530 --> 02:26:27,760
clone club he said had that visa do they

3302
02:26:25,780 --> 02:26:32,891
know the genes responsible that they

3303
02:26:27,760 --> 02:26:36,670
express the synthase for CBC it's a CBC

3304
02:26:32,890 --> 02:26:38,859
synthase gene yeah so yeah so is that

3305
02:26:36,670 --> 02:26:42,879
known is is there you know yeah that's

3306
02:26:38,860 --> 02:26:44,530
that's that's well known so I I wonder I

3307
02:26:42,879 --> 02:26:49,029
mean just thinking about what

3308
02:26:44,530 --> 02:26:50,980
Tiwa not life sciences did with synthase

3309
02:26:49,030 --> 02:26:53,141
which is can they put some face in the

3310
02:26:50,979 --> 02:26:56,140
yeast now and express it in yeast well

3311
02:26:53,140 --> 02:26:58,420
that's what all of these folks were

3312
02:26:56,140 --> 02:27:00,129
doing because there was the German group

3313
02:26:58,420 --> 02:27:04,030
and there was two other groups worldwide

3314
02:27:00,129 --> 02:27:08,469
that were doing this kind of preliminary

3315
02:27:04,030 --> 02:27:11,079
work and the the barest ones inserted

3316
02:27:08,469 --> 02:27:18,520
various synthesis in and were able to

3317
02:27:11,079 --> 02:27:20,560
produce THC from CBG or CBD from CBG but

3318
02:27:18,521 --> 02:27:24,370
none of them had made the entire chain

3319
02:27:20,560 --> 02:27:28,299
where they were producing CBG which was

3320
02:27:24,370 --> 02:27:32,530
then synthesized into the next that

3321
02:27:28,299 --> 02:27:34,569
cannabinoid target but it will be done

3322
02:27:32,530 --> 02:27:37,480
and they were all talking about

3323
02:27:34,569 --> 02:27:40,931
targeting things like CBC and CBG

3324
02:27:37,479 --> 02:27:44,529
because they're rare and difficult to

3325
02:27:40,931 --> 02:27:46,329
find compared to THC and CBD what were

3326
02:27:44,530 --> 02:27:49,150
the percentages the cbc that you were

3327
02:27:46,329 --> 02:27:53,079
seeing in those c amp you don't mind me

3328
02:27:49,149 --> 02:27:56,819
asking if i'm remembering love to top my

3329
02:27:53,079 --> 02:28:01,090
head i think they weren't that high like

3330
02:27:56,819 --> 02:28:04,690
because they were flowering so much you

3331
02:28:01,090 --> 02:28:07,870
know it but when he considered to how

3332
02:28:04,690 --> 02:28:10,989
much CB c find the normal varieties it

3333
02:28:07,870 --> 02:28:12,360
was really a lot it was approaching 10%

3334
02:28:10,989 --> 02:28:19,750
if i remember correctly

3335
02:28:12,360 --> 02:28:20,650
wow that you know it's CB 0 reason cbc

3336
02:28:19,750 --> 02:28:23,799
can't be

3337
02:28:20,649 --> 02:28:26,049
now bred and isolated in kind of the

3338
02:28:23,799 --> 02:28:28,560
same way CBD was where we were surprised

3339
02:28:26,049 --> 02:28:32,069
to see six or seven percent strains

3340
02:28:28,560 --> 02:28:34,529
years ago and now well you actually you

3341
02:28:32,069 --> 02:28:39,270
can you can breed for it the same way

3342
02:28:34,530 --> 02:28:43,381
but but it's in very low levels whereas

3343
02:28:39,271 --> 02:28:52,950
if you do certain tricks like GW did

3344
02:28:43,380 --> 02:28:57,149
then you get a much higher levels so

3345
02:28:52,950 --> 02:29:00,829
again Sam long us long awkward pause

3346
02:28:57,149 --> 02:29:06,091
yeah I'm still thinking about this so

3347
02:29:00,829 --> 02:29:08,970
what what about that original plant that

3348
02:29:06,091 --> 02:29:11,489
you identified that I think you said

3349
02:29:08,970 --> 02:29:13,921
that it just you liked it or that it

3350
02:29:11,489 --> 02:29:17,220
stood out that turned out to have some

3351
02:29:13,921 --> 02:29:19,140
CBC that then you kept working with and

3352
02:29:17,220 --> 02:29:22,319
centrally found this one that had as

3353
02:29:19,140 --> 02:29:25,591
much as 10% was there anything specific

3354
02:29:22,319 --> 02:29:31,579
that stood out about the plant or made

3355
02:29:25,591 --> 02:29:35,440
you something I did not like about it

3356
02:29:31,579 --> 02:29:35,440
[Music]

3357
02:29:36,261 --> 02:29:47,671
I'm not particularly fond of CBD or CBC

3358
02:29:40,399 --> 02:29:51,239
and it had both both of those but more

3359
02:29:47,671 --> 02:29:55,550
CBC and some you didn't like in its

3360
02:29:51,239 --> 02:29:59,011
growing or sway it smelled the way it it

3361
02:29:55,550 --> 02:30:04,649
it's just its general characteristics

3362
02:29:59,011 --> 02:30:08,761
the way resin from CBD plants is is not

3363
02:30:04,649 --> 02:30:13,591
really really super sticky and greasy

3364
02:30:08,761 --> 02:30:19,591
oily the way THC is but a little bit in

3365
02:30:13,591 --> 02:30:22,310
that direction you remember did you do

3366
02:30:19,591 --> 02:30:25,110
any chirping tests on that no

3367
02:30:22,310 --> 02:30:28,921
unfortunately I never terpene tested but

3368
02:30:25,110 --> 02:30:31,110
what I did do was this the seed was

3369
02:30:28,921 --> 02:30:36,390
imported by a friend of mine from

3370
02:30:31,110 --> 02:30:43,370
Afghanistan it was a direct Afghan seed

3371
02:30:36,390 --> 02:30:43,369
important it's where we finally did once

3372
02:30:46,190 --> 02:30:52,620
all right well that's quiet time here

3373
02:30:51,239 --> 02:30:54,181
you know I know that I see Marcus

3374
02:30:52,620 --> 02:30:56,070
setting up the machine over there but I

3375
02:30:54,181 --> 02:30:57,091
mean I wasn't on right away

3376
02:30:56,069 --> 02:31:00,210
so I was still trying to get myself

3377
02:30:57,091 --> 02:31:02,251
together this morning but maybe if while

3378
02:31:00,210 --> 02:31:05,369
we have some downtime I don't know if

3379
02:31:02,251 --> 02:31:06,870
Wade told you about the adventure he had

3380
02:31:05,370 --> 02:31:10,501
fighting off wild animals of this

3381
02:31:06,870 --> 02:31:12,990
property and then using cannabis

3382
02:31:10,501 --> 02:31:16,140
tropicals that we may need to run some

3383
02:31:12,989 --> 02:31:20,431
tests with wait did you tell that story

3384
02:31:16,140 --> 02:31:23,489
before I got on was that record yeah no

3385
02:31:20,431 --> 02:31:26,341
I told the story last week I showed my

3386
02:31:23,489 --> 02:31:28,560
hands I don't know if you can really see

3387
02:31:26,341 --> 02:31:33,271
what's going on but I'm still wearing a

3388
02:31:28,560 --> 02:31:38,040
splint this thumb was torn up pretty

3389
02:31:33,271 --> 02:31:40,141
badly and it's healed up yeah I both

3390
02:31:38,040 --> 02:31:43,199
hands were torn up real badly but this

3391
02:31:40,140 --> 02:31:48,181
one I started using are cannabis cream

3392
02:31:43,200 --> 02:31:53,341
on two days after I got I went swimming

3393
02:31:48,181 --> 02:31:58,461
with the raccoon and yeah it was pretty

3394
02:31:53,341 --> 02:32:01,711
dramatic the change literally this hand

3395
02:31:58,460 --> 02:32:04,529
is pretty much healed I've got a couple

3396
02:32:01,710 --> 02:32:09,329
of spots where there's still deep wounds

3397
02:32:04,530 --> 02:32:10,980
that are healing but all the claw damage

3398
02:32:09,329 --> 02:32:14,370
that happened to my wrist in hand is

3399
02:32:10,979 --> 02:32:17,729
gone and that was in within the first

3400
02:32:14,370 --> 02:32:20,011
couple of days let's see what was it on

3401
02:32:17,729 --> 02:32:24,300
Thursday

3402
02:32:20,011 --> 02:32:27,810
three days after the attack I saw my

3403
02:32:24,300 --> 02:32:29,699
primary care physician and showed him my

3404
02:32:27,810 --> 02:32:34,681
hands they did what's called a wound

3405
02:32:29,700 --> 02:32:36,570
check and and he and I asked him if he

3406
02:32:34,681 --> 02:32:38,940
could tell which hand I'd been using

3407
02:32:36,569 --> 02:32:42,779
cannabis cream on because I told him

3408
02:32:38,940 --> 02:32:45,171
about my health care approach and yeah

3409
02:32:42,780 --> 02:32:47,730
he spotted the difference right away and

3410
02:32:45,171 --> 02:32:49,800
we talked for a few minutes about what

3411
02:32:47,729 --> 02:32:53,899
that cream was and what I was doing with

3412
02:32:49,800 --> 02:32:56,489
it and yeah I just want to say that a

3413
02:32:53,899 --> 02:32:59,220
topical preparation

3414
02:32:56,489 --> 02:33:03,931
prepared for ready assimilation into the

3415
02:32:59,220 --> 02:33:06,149
skin it has CBD and THC and some of them

3416
02:33:03,931 --> 02:33:10,409
still in the acid forms some of the oils

3417
02:33:06,149 --> 02:33:11,819
that Forrest and I are working with not

3418
02:33:10,409 --> 02:33:16,560
only helped a lot with the pain of

3419
02:33:11,819 --> 02:33:19,920
healing and the itching but the new skin

3420
02:33:16,560 --> 02:33:22,229
that's growing over the bigger wounds is

3421
02:33:19,920 --> 02:33:25,140
really tender and it feels like it's on

3422
02:33:22,229 --> 02:33:29,761
fire if I touch it but meantime if I put

3423
02:33:25,140 --> 02:33:32,190
some of this cream on yeah I've I've

3424
02:33:29,761 --> 02:33:34,979
been working in the garden and taken

3425
02:33:32,190 --> 02:33:36,271
down plants and whatnot it's looking

3426
02:33:34,979 --> 02:33:40,379
forward to getting rid of this splint

3427
02:33:36,271 --> 02:33:43,440
this week that's the cream that you make

3428
02:33:40,379 --> 02:33:44,550
for our EB kids and bring it back to

3429
02:33:43,440 --> 02:33:48,630
some of what we were talking about in

3430
02:33:44,550 --> 02:33:50,340
the beginning with Keegan there that has

3431
02:33:48,629 --> 02:33:54,089
and we found a big boost in efficacy

3432
02:33:50,340 --> 02:33:58,409
when we reintroduced terpenes at the end

3433
02:33:54,090 --> 02:33:59,970
of the process hold a big boost in

3434
02:33:58,409 --> 02:34:01,379
efficacy so we have those turf and

3435
02:33:59,970 --> 02:34:04,890
isolates as well like he was talking

3436
02:34:01,379 --> 02:34:07,680
about and it doesn't take much you know

3437
02:34:04,890 --> 02:34:09,539
it is expensive if you are trying to run

3438
02:34:07,681 --> 02:34:11,730
it into a really high level model like

3439
02:34:09,540 --> 02:34:14,460
you would with smoke or vapor material

3440
02:34:11,729 --> 02:34:18,470
but if the little does go a long way

3441
02:34:14,459 --> 02:34:18,470
with some of those those terpenes

3442
02:34:23,248 --> 02:34:34,238
look at that squish bubble man's got

3443
02:34:25,689 --> 02:34:36,039
going how'd it turn out Ben pricing the

3444
02:34:34,238 --> 02:34:38,648
short path distillation setups and

3445
02:34:36,039 --> 02:34:39,970
Rogers or the clad Reyes Network's gold

3446
02:34:38,648 --> 02:34:41,728
will be a hundred percent solvent free

3447
02:34:39,969 --> 02:34:58,799
in the next couple years

3448
02:34:41,728 --> 02:35:01,868
those sasquatch machines look was he

3449
02:34:58,799 --> 02:35:04,688
being able to get down to life negative

3450
02:35:01,869 --> 02:35:08,970
180 degrees to kind of find out what

3451
02:35:04,689 --> 02:35:11,408
terpenes might be there 140 yeah 140 oh

3452
02:35:08,969 --> 02:35:16,799
man I'm sure that you've got a lot of by

3453
02:35:11,408 --> 02:35:16,799
authorizing plant material for dry set

3454
02:35:17,398 --> 02:35:25,090
um you're sure that I've done what sorry

3455
02:35:20,020 --> 02:35:33,970
a lot of I mean I wouldn't say a lot but

3456
02:35:25,090 --> 02:35:37,238
enough that I know maybe about six

3457
02:35:33,969 --> 02:35:40,420
months ago and I have noticed when

3458
02:35:37,238 --> 02:35:42,309
pulling that vacuum and kind of having

3459
02:35:40,420 --> 02:35:45,248
that deep freeze that there were

3460
02:35:42,309 --> 02:35:46,420
definitely some kind of turkeys that we

3461
02:35:45,248 --> 02:35:49,090
were pulling at those really cold

3462
02:35:46,420 --> 02:35:54,789
temperatures and I wasn't even to get

3463
02:35:49,090 --> 02:35:56,228
this analytically tested yeah so injured

3464
02:35:54,789 --> 02:35:57,850
jumped off you know I don't know what

3465
02:35:56,228 --> 02:36:01,809
he's talking about liquid nitrogen is

3466
02:35:57,850 --> 02:36:03,850
about 9 minus 195 so I don't really need

3467
02:36:01,809 --> 02:36:07,118
a special engineering all you need to do

3468
02:36:03,850 --> 02:36:09,699
her a supply contract to get liquid

3469
02:36:07,119 --> 02:36:13,029
nitrogen he was talking about a specific

3470
02:36:09,699 --> 02:36:14,800
pump we're talking about doing it

3471
02:36:13,029 --> 02:36:17,020
without going out and buying liquid

3472
02:36:14,799 --> 02:36:23,108
nitrogen all the time brain boy we're

3473
02:36:17,020 --> 02:36:25,029
good we got a pump and gets it down to

3474
02:36:23,109 --> 02:36:27,670
those temperatures where we need it to

3475
02:36:25,029 --> 02:36:30,340
be without running out somebody remind

3476
02:36:27,670 --> 02:36:33,238
us stop out interest stop deep throating

3477
02:36:30,340 --> 02:36:33,238
your Mike yeah

3478
02:36:33,629 --> 02:36:40,600
and this mic liquid-nitrogen screen may

3479
02:36:37,450 --> 02:36:43,301
be okay but listen then

3480
02:36:40,601 --> 02:36:45,909
derpy engine will reduce it down to 140

3481
02:36:43,300 --> 02:36:52,841
and I'm thinking that we will find some

3482
02:36:45,909 --> 02:36:55,360
stuff in that area you know I know

3483
02:36:52,841 --> 02:36:59,979
you're a fan of liquid nitrogen and you

3484
02:36:55,360 --> 02:37:02,319
had Maya talk about certain things I'm

3485
02:36:59,979 --> 02:37:04,810
also a big fan of collecting terpenes

3486
02:37:02,319 --> 02:37:09,610
and I've been at it for a little while

3487
02:37:04,810 --> 02:37:11,289
now and I think that we're headed in the

3488
02:37:09,610 --> 02:37:13,210
right direction with this fairly heat

3489
02:37:11,290 --> 02:37:15,280
pump see and then we'll announce what

3490
02:37:13,209 --> 02:37:20,919
happens and if it's good we'll make them

3491
02:37:15,280 --> 02:37:26,920
available that's cool that's all we're

3492
02:37:20,920 --> 02:37:29,050
saying I don't know how to turn it down

3493
02:37:26,920 --> 02:37:32,200
I'll have to work on finding out just

3494
02:37:29,050 --> 02:37:33,119
talk of it it's already three feet away

3495
02:37:32,200 --> 02:37:36,790
from my mouth

3496
02:37:33,120 --> 02:37:42,130
okay how's that is that any better it's

3497
02:37:36,790 --> 02:37:44,410
wonderful you're on point I'm gonna hit

3498
02:37:42,129 --> 02:37:48,430
some of this medi Kush rosin that I just

3499
02:37:44,409 --> 02:37:51,700
made thanks to the Sasquatch m1 here we

3500
02:37:48,431 --> 02:37:53,620
go point is is if you're trapping your

3501
02:37:51,700 --> 02:37:57,280
vacuum lines and you're just using a

3502
02:37:53,620 --> 02:38:00,011
simple cold trap all you need is liquid

3503
02:37:57,280 --> 02:38:02,261
nitrogen inside a Dewar and you could

3504
02:38:00,011 --> 02:38:04,091
trap all that you don't need to wait for

3505
02:38:02,261 --> 02:38:07,750
some company to come out with some

3506
02:38:04,091 --> 02:38:10,450
device that doesn't exist yet so it's

3507
02:38:07,750 --> 02:38:14,440
been used for you know a long time this

3508
02:38:10,450 --> 02:38:19,620
is how you keep your vacuum pump from

3509
02:38:14,440 --> 02:38:22,721
not seizing up all the time because well

3510
02:38:19,620 --> 02:38:25,780
there's always there's always that

3511
02:38:22,720 --> 02:38:28,779
reason that we're making it is as an

3512
02:38:25,780 --> 02:38:31,870
advanced system for vacuum pump saving

3513
02:38:28,780 --> 02:38:35,079
and on our larger commercial system

3514
02:38:31,870 --> 02:38:38,141
we're looking for way to gather a lot of

3515
02:38:35,079 --> 02:38:39,579
terpenes and we think if we have the

3516
02:38:38,140 --> 02:38:41,319
right temperature and we bring it

3517
02:38:39,579 --> 02:38:43,659
through that that we'll be able to

3518
02:38:41,319 --> 02:38:45,559
collect you know massive amounts of

3519
02:38:43,659 --> 02:38:49,129
terpenes so

3520
02:38:45,559 --> 02:38:52,219
the 710 scientific one that I have now

3521
02:38:49,129 --> 02:38:55,039
that we sell called the blue meanie is a

3522
02:38:52,219 --> 02:38:57,799
very excellent one I find no problems

3523
02:38:55,040 --> 02:39:01,490
with it we've had it tested I think we

3524
02:38:57,799 --> 02:39:04,579
had some contaminated material one

3525
02:39:01,489 --> 02:39:06,229
though that came up with some minor

3526
02:39:04,579 --> 02:39:10,670
amounts of something in it but we

3527
02:39:06,229 --> 02:39:12,889
tracked it down what it was and machine

3528
02:39:10,670 --> 02:39:16,870
works exactly we're just going to try to

3529
02:39:12,889 --> 02:39:16,869
go through a much colder between those

3530
02:39:18,370 --> 02:39:26,680
we want it you might want to run it for

3531
02:39:21,170 --> 02:39:31,790
long period of time and liquid nitrogen

3532
02:39:26,680 --> 02:39:33,920
expensive you know a lot of money for

3533
02:39:31,790 --> 02:39:35,600
liquid not only that for people that

3534
02:39:33,920 --> 02:39:37,520
don't know when you order that [ __ ] you

3535
02:39:35,600 --> 02:39:41,090
got to use it like it's not gonna just

3536
02:39:37,520 --> 02:39:43,790
last forever it dissipates yeah within a

3537
02:39:41,090 --> 02:39:46,100
few hours even in a drawer

3538
02:39:43,790 --> 02:39:48,380
yeah I guess depending on your dog

3539
02:39:46,100 --> 02:39:50,960
[ __ ] that's absolute [ __ ] you

3540
02:39:48,379 --> 02:39:53,689
can keep it for several days and I'm all

3541
02:39:50,959 --> 02:39:55,579
completer doer I'm telling you that's

3542
02:39:53,690 --> 02:39:59,510
that's absolute [ __ ] they have doers

3543
02:39:55,579 --> 02:40:01,850
days for most days is the most I've ever

3544
02:39:59,510 --> 02:40:04,190
had it stored for and I've got a whole

3545
02:40:01,850 --> 02:40:12,739
bunch of the best money can buy dwarves

3546
02:40:04,190 --> 02:40:14,450
here it would be best if you guys didn't

3547
02:40:12,739 --> 02:40:16,610
talk at the same time so when one's

3548
02:40:14,450 --> 02:40:18,440
talking what the other does is they they

3549
02:40:16,610 --> 02:40:20,060
close their mouth and they listen and

3550
02:40:18,440 --> 02:40:22,310
then you wait for your turn and then you

3551
02:40:20,059 --> 02:40:23,989
say what you want to say in return we'll

3552
02:40:22,309 --> 02:40:27,109
listen to this all day if you guys want

3553
02:40:23,989 --> 02:40:29,180
to go back I'm just saying that one is

3554
02:40:27,110 --> 02:40:31,610
widely available liquid nitrogen is

3555
02:40:29,180 --> 02:40:33,829
widely available to people yep well I'll

3556
02:40:31,610 --> 02:40:35,930
tell you this much from a person who was

3557
02:40:33,829 --> 02:40:39,739
gonna start playing around with liquid

3558
02:40:35,930 --> 02:40:41,479
nitrogen as widely available as it is it

3559
02:40:39,739 --> 02:40:43,369
was still a bit of a pain in the ass to

3560
02:40:41,479 --> 02:40:45,379
kind of get it order it up and get the

3561
02:40:43,370 --> 02:40:46,940
door and do the hole all that sort of

3562
02:40:45,379 --> 02:40:49,759
thing and there's and when there's that

3563
02:40:46,940 --> 02:40:51,920
aspect of things in any aspect of

3564
02:40:49,760 --> 02:40:53,329
business someone's gonna come up with

3565
02:40:51,920 --> 02:40:56,450
something that makes it easier for

3566
02:40:53,329 --> 02:40:57,969
people I mean Andrew uses a lot of

3567
02:40:56,450 --> 02:41:00,939
liquid nitrogen

3568
02:40:57,969 --> 02:41:03,159
I do I use it for crushing I use it for

3569
02:41:00,939 --> 02:41:05,889
cryogenic whereas for example mark I

3570
02:41:03,159 --> 02:41:10,659
know you know about liquid nitrogen how

3571
02:41:05,889 --> 02:41:12,639
do you use it often yes yes use it to

3572
02:41:10,659 --> 02:41:16,029
make sure that again whenever you pull a

3573
02:41:12,639 --> 02:41:17,648
vacuum that yeah pulling this is this is

3574
02:41:16,029 --> 02:41:20,319
in what your this you're talking about

3575
02:41:17,648 --> 02:41:23,978
an extraction that you're doing no talk

3576
02:41:20,318 --> 02:41:26,439
talking about using it to trap anything

3577
02:41:23,978 --> 02:41:28,769
that you're pulling a vacuum on so

3578
02:41:26,439 --> 02:41:30,420
particular high vacuum distillation

3579
02:41:28,770 --> 02:41:33,819
right

3580
02:41:30,420 --> 02:41:36,760
elation or anything that you're putting

3581
02:41:33,818 --> 02:41:38,769
vacuum on including vacuum ovens where

3582
02:41:36,760 --> 02:41:40,978
you're trapping something you have to

3583
02:41:38,770 --> 02:41:44,140
trap it somehow and you trap it

3584
02:41:40,978 --> 02:41:45,608
cryogenically typically with just it's

3585
02:41:44,139 --> 02:41:47,619
nothing more than what's called a cold

3586
02:41:45,609 --> 02:41:50,920
finger which is like a really long test

3587
02:41:47,620 --> 02:41:53,170
tube with a glass yeah that goes down to

3588
02:41:50,920 --> 02:41:56,590
the bottom and these things basically

3589
02:41:53,170 --> 02:42:00,100
sit in another Dewar that you pour

3590
02:41:56,590 --> 02:42:01,600
liquid nitrogen into and then when you

3591
02:42:00,100 --> 02:42:05,829
pour liquid nitrogen into it yeah you

3592
02:42:01,600 --> 02:42:07,840
could usually like wrap like a little

3593
02:42:05,829 --> 02:42:11,139
thermal blanket around to keep it from

3594
02:42:07,840 --> 02:42:13,689
evaporating but those usually say good

3595
02:42:11,139 --> 02:42:16,590
overnight I've even kept those traps on

3596
02:42:13,689 --> 02:42:20,020
a two liter coal finger for you know

3597
02:42:16,590 --> 02:42:21,728
multiple days so you know you can keep

3598
02:42:20,020 --> 02:42:24,399
liquid nitrogen down there for a while

3599
02:42:21,728 --> 02:42:26,438
and just the point is is that rather

3600
02:42:24,398 --> 02:42:28,510
than pulling all of that into your

3601
02:42:26,439 --> 02:42:32,109
vacuum pump you should be trapping that

3602
02:42:28,510 --> 02:42:34,180
and typically again liquid nitrogen is

3603
02:42:32,109 --> 02:42:38,979
the preferred way of trapping it some

3604
02:42:34,180 --> 02:42:41,079
people use flushes of like it's atone

3605
02:42:38,978 --> 02:42:43,389
and and and dry ice and that'll work

3606
02:42:41,079 --> 02:42:47,620
that's like about minus 78 but liquid

3607
02:42:43,389 --> 02:42:50,349
nitrogen is is minus 195 and so you

3608
02:42:47,620 --> 02:42:53,370
should try to do liquid nitrogen if you

3609
02:42:50,350 --> 02:42:58,260
can do it if not dry ice acetone works

3610
02:42:53,370 --> 02:42:58,260
to get you down to minus 78 at least

3611
02:43:00,250 --> 02:43:08,750
well anyway I I like our new eco pump I

3612
02:43:06,620 --> 02:43:10,910
don't look you say it's readily

3613
02:43:08,750 --> 02:43:13,310
available but I have to take a four hour

3614
02:43:10,909 --> 02:43:15,039
drive to get liquid nitrogen myself I

3615
02:43:13,310 --> 02:43:18,529
live in the middle of the woods

3616
02:43:15,040 --> 02:43:22,460
electricity still being piped into me so

3617
02:43:18,530 --> 02:43:24,891
an old pump is a handy thing you know I

3618
02:43:22,459 --> 02:43:30,079
I use the llama liquid nitrogen we go

3619
02:43:24,890 --> 02:43:33,500
get a couple of weekly and bring it back

3620
02:43:30,079 --> 02:43:36,470
oh is it you know every time I don't

3621
02:43:33,500 --> 02:43:40,190
fill a 50 gallon grow up with flowers

3622
02:43:36,470 --> 02:43:41,270
maybe 75 pounds of flowers pouring on a

3623
02:43:40,190 --> 02:43:43,640
quart of liquid nitrogen

3624
02:43:41,271 --> 02:43:47,900
cover it with a 3/4 inch plywood board

3625
02:43:43,640 --> 02:43:49,760
count to 50 open it up and I take a 4x4

3626
02:43:47,899 --> 02:43:52,729
to it and within about two minutes I

3627
02:43:49,760 --> 02:43:54,920
have complete green powder down

3628
02:43:52,729 --> 02:43:58,729
occupying only about two inches of the

3629
02:43:54,920 --> 02:44:01,431
drum so I use it a lot but I still

3630
02:43:58,729 --> 02:44:07,279
prefer the mechanical coke traps with

3631
02:44:01,431 --> 02:44:09,380
the coke pump so so far that's what this

3632
02:44:07,280 --> 02:44:11,329
is all about it's not it's it's all

3633
02:44:09,379 --> 02:44:12,829
about offering options all this

3634
02:44:11,329 --> 02:44:15,260
information is about off offering

3635
02:44:12,829 --> 02:44:17,420
options if you know about another option

3636
02:44:15,260 --> 02:44:19,431
that's great they're all options that

3637
02:44:17,420 --> 02:44:21,079
people can have and we can just

3638
02:44:19,431 --> 02:44:22,640
constantly get stuck in this sort of

3639
02:44:21,079 --> 02:44:24,289
like no this is what you need to do this

3640
02:44:22,640 --> 02:44:25,850
is what everyone's doing it's like we

3641
02:44:24,290 --> 02:44:27,380
stayed with that we would never move

3642
02:44:25,851 --> 02:44:30,141
forward and create things that were

3643
02:44:27,379 --> 02:44:33,199
innovative and new and exciting and so

3644
02:44:30,140 --> 02:44:35,779
but like oh as I as you look at Keegan's

3645
02:44:33,200 --> 02:44:38,120
lab there he's got tanks of co2 they're

3646
02:44:35,780 --> 02:44:40,790
the same company that provides those

3647
02:44:38,120 --> 02:44:43,190
tanks also provides liquid nitrogen so

3648
02:44:40,790 --> 02:44:45,141
again yeah is it difficult to get it and

3649
02:44:43,190 --> 02:44:47,960
difficult to get to areas yeah probably

3650
02:44:45,140 --> 02:44:50,090
but in other more urban areas or areas

3651
02:44:47,959 --> 02:44:52,729
where you can buy compressed gases and

3652
02:44:50,090 --> 02:44:54,829
liquids you can buy liquid nitrogen is

3653
02:44:52,729 --> 02:44:56,629
it expensive you have to rent the

3654
02:44:54,829 --> 02:45:00,829
Dewar's it's a whole thing but yeah

3655
02:44:56,629 --> 02:45:03,799
having my own laboratory having around

3656
02:45:00,829 --> 02:45:06,409
the laboratory is a really key thing for

3657
02:45:03,799 --> 02:45:10,850
several reasons so since you're ready

3658
02:45:06,409 --> 02:45:13,029
gonna have look by the way use people

3659
02:45:10,851 --> 02:45:17,289
asking about using co2 to do

3660
02:45:13,029 --> 02:45:18,789
same thing I know do not use co2 to get

3661
02:45:17,289 --> 02:45:21,609
your stuff cold to crush it

3662
02:45:18,789 --> 02:45:24,310
co2 inherently gathers a lot of water

3663
02:45:21,609 --> 02:45:26,430
and will make your stuff damp and that's

3664
02:45:24,309 --> 02:45:29,350
the last thing you need

3665
02:45:26,430 --> 02:45:30,760
hey welcome Alec from SC labs in the

3666
02:45:29,350 --> 02:45:32,369
house I see that he just showed up

3667
02:45:30,760 --> 02:45:36,609

3682
02:46:08,469 --> 02:46:13,898
some of the smoke is subsided from Santa

3683
02:46:10,449 --> 02:46:15,279
Cruz which is pretty awesome it's crazy

3684
02:46:13,898 --> 02:46:16,838
how much fires are burning up in

3685
02:46:15,279 --> 02:46:18,970
Northern California still though yet

3686
02:46:16,838 --> 02:46:21,338
fully uncontained or fully contained

3687
02:46:18,969 --> 02:46:26,048
it's a I think only a 25-30 percent

3688
02:46:21,338 --> 02:46:28,359
Noma County Jesus that's crazy it is

3689
02:46:26,049 --> 02:46:31,260
crazy this Lake late in the season just

3690
02:46:28,359 --> 02:46:36,549
like no rains and mad winds and dry

3691
02:46:31,260 --> 02:46:39,100
brush and trees just ready to go up ya

3692
02:46:36,549 --> 02:46:40,629
know it's it's really fascinating to

3693
02:46:39,100 --> 02:46:42,459
kind of see how the whole kind of cycle

3694
02:46:40,629 --> 02:46:43,949
went with you know we got you tons of

3695
02:46:42,459 --> 02:46:46,209
water you know that earlier this year

3696
02:46:43,949 --> 02:46:48,699
but you know if anything that grew the

3697
02:46:46,209 --> 02:46:51,600
grass out quite a bit or extra kinland

3698
02:46:48,699 --> 02:46:53,739
burn and yeah just it's the never

3699
02:46:51,600 --> 02:46:56,140
experienced kind of from a you know from

3700
02:46:53,738 --> 02:46:58,180
within the state disaster I think that's

3701
02:46:56,139 --> 02:47:00,788
affected as many you know close people

3702
02:46:58,180 --> 02:47:02,379
in my life and friends and family that

3703
02:47:00,789 --> 02:47:03,879
we have in our community and so yeah

3704
02:47:02,379 --> 02:47:06,209
it's a lot of prayers and blessings God

3705
02:47:03,879 --> 02:47:09,959
to everybody that's been affected and

3706
02:47:06,209 --> 02:47:12,549
going through this really difficult time

3707
02:47:09,959 --> 02:47:14,350
yeah it's been pretty brutal I guess sub

3708
02:47:12,549 --> 02:47:15,999
cool was on earlier he was telling us

3709
02:47:14,350 --> 02:47:17,828
about raising a bunch of money through

3710
02:47:15,998 --> 02:47:20,048
the weed nerds nation they've been

3711
02:47:17,828 --> 02:47:22,628
putting money together for people in

3712
02:47:20,049 --> 02:47:24,039
need and clothes and food and whatnot so

3713
02:47:22,629 --> 02:47:25,090
that's pretty awesome to see at the same

3714
02:47:24,039 --> 02:47:28,930
time people coming

3715
02:47:25,090 --> 02:47:30,760
other helping those most in need no you

3716
02:47:28,930 --> 02:47:32,500
know that's that's been really really

3717
02:47:30,760 --> 02:47:34,478
inspiring an exciting thing you know

3718
02:47:32,500 --> 02:47:36,579
kind of so much people within our

3719
02:47:34,478 --> 02:47:39,069
community that have resources and

3720
02:47:36,579 --> 02:47:41,920
ability you know whether or not that's

3721
02:47:39,069 --> 02:47:43,659
you know kind of small donations or you

3722
02:47:41,920 --> 02:47:46,540
know kind of donations of cannabis or

3723
02:47:43,659 --> 02:47:48,309
you know just just crowdfunding and

3724
02:47:46,540 --> 02:47:50,710
mobilizing the effort to you know help

3725
02:47:48,309 --> 02:47:51,939
show support to like yeah we as a

3726
02:47:50,709 --> 02:47:56,079
community kind of such an obligation

3727
02:47:51,939 --> 02:47:58,420
yeah does do good with this plant and

3728
02:47:56,079 --> 02:48:01,329
you know it empowers us to do that and

3729
02:47:58,420 --> 02:48:03,670
so so I think anybody that's you know

3730
02:48:01,329 --> 02:48:06,789
doing anything in their power to donate

3731
02:48:03,670 --> 02:48:08,350
or to you know help raise relief towards

3732
02:48:06,790 --> 02:48:10,330
these Northern California fires whatever

3733
02:48:08,350 --> 02:48:12,520
type of you know GoFundMe or fundraiser

3734
02:48:10,329 --> 02:48:21,700
what half of you I think there's a is

3735
02:48:12,520 --> 02:48:25,210
amazing so I think the point is to just

3736
02:48:21,700 --> 02:48:28,149
do something yeah exactly exactly take

3737
02:48:25,209 --> 02:48:29,589
your you know thoughts and prayers and

3738
02:48:28,148 --> 02:48:31,809
feel good about them at the end of the

3739
02:48:29,590 --> 02:48:34,210
night but don't you know you got to do

3740
02:48:31,809 --> 02:48:36,459
something physical take action donate

3741
02:48:34,209 --> 02:48:46,449
money volunteered time harm something do

3742
02:48:36,459 --> 02:48:48,728
something visible my dad used to say

3743
02:48:46,450 --> 02:48:53,220
that he said it slightly differently he

3744
02:48:48,728 --> 02:48:55,779
would say get off your ass totally

3745
02:48:53,219 --> 02:48:58,049
that's that's the old-school way of

3746
02:48:55,780 --> 02:49:00,939
saying it

3747
02:48:58,049 --> 02:49:04,809
yeah I'm wishing for things to change is

3748
02:49:00,939 --> 02:49:07,059
great some coping changes I guess but

3749
02:49:04,809 --> 02:49:09,159
you know unless you get up and do

3750
02:49:07,059 --> 02:49:14,709
something to make change you're really

3751
02:49:09,159 --> 02:49:16,898
just kind of not doing much you know yes

3752
02:49:14,709 --> 02:49:18,250
time to be an armchair activist right

3753
02:49:16,898 --> 02:49:20,769
now that's right actually doing

3754
02:49:18,250 --> 02:49:22,569
something that's right I know people on

3755
02:49:20,770 --> 02:49:24,790
the panel know that cuz they live it and

3756
02:49:22,569 --> 02:49:26,409
something that I try to model for

3757
02:49:24,790 --> 02:49:29,890
everybody but it's amazing what a little

3758
02:49:26,409 --> 02:49:33,010
bit of just deciding you want to make

3759
02:49:29,889 --> 02:49:35,170
change will do you know a few hours of

3760
02:49:33,010 --> 02:49:37,260
wanting to make change and getting off

3761
02:49:35,170 --> 02:49:39,000
your ass and doing something

3762
02:49:37,260 --> 02:49:42,420
will produce more results than the last

3763
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:45,029
two years of hoping and wishing and in

3764
02:49:42,420 --> 02:49:46,950
you know waiting for someone else to

3765
02:49:45,029 --> 02:49:48,630
make that change you know so everyone

3766
02:49:46,950 --> 02:49:50,609
listen and don't wait for someone else

3767
02:49:48,629 --> 02:49:53,879
to donate five bucks

3768
02:49:50,609 --> 02:49:55,800
stop right now get the soil King it's a

3769
02:49:53,879 --> 02:49:57,239
sub pools group get to whatever whatever

3770
02:49:55,799 --> 02:50:01,949
charity you see is putting money into

3771
02:49:57,239 --> 02:50:04,770
good work and just do it just do it

3772
02:50:01,950 --> 02:50:07,079
already would you you vote with your

3773
02:50:04,770 --> 02:50:09,450
dollars more than you actually vote in

3774
02:50:07,079 --> 02:50:11,909
the actual any election so you know if

3775
02:50:09,450 --> 02:50:14,130
you've got any kind of spare change you

3776
02:50:11,909 --> 02:50:15,898
know your spare change adds up when

3777
02:50:14,129 --> 02:50:17,879
other people throw in their spare change

3778
02:50:15,898 --> 02:50:20,309
and that adds up to people who have

3779
02:50:17,879 --> 02:50:22,528
absolutely nothing I've lost my house

3780
02:50:20,309 --> 02:50:24,629
I've lost in a fire I told you guys a

3781
02:50:22,529 --> 02:50:25,500
week before Christmas you know done by

3782
02:50:24,629 --> 02:50:28,139
my own hand

3783
02:50:25,500 --> 02:50:32,430
yeah I know it's like to lose absolutely

3784
02:50:28,139 --> 02:50:33,898
everything and I unfortunately know what

3785
02:50:32,430 --> 02:50:36,659
they're going through and I it's

3786
02:50:33,898 --> 02:50:38,099
absolutely ungodly painful I was a child

3787
02:50:36,659 --> 02:50:40,978
that was only seven I can't imagine

3788
02:50:38,100 --> 02:50:43,439
being the responsible adult with having

3789
02:50:40,978 --> 02:50:47,670
two bills owed and the mortgage on the

3790
02:50:43,439 --> 02:50:49,409
house etc etc and then your savings and

3791
02:50:47,670 --> 02:50:51,359
your opportunity and here you are you

3792
02:50:49,409 --> 02:50:53,609
were just trying to get yourself legally

3793
02:50:51,359 --> 02:50:55,529
set up with a farm so that you could be

3794
02:50:53,609 --> 02:50:57,329
in the legal market and boom

3795
02:50:55,529 --> 02:51:01,529
everything's gone in the blink of an eye

3796
02:50:57,329 --> 02:51:03,689
and people have lost their opportunities

3797
02:51:01,529 --> 02:51:05,670
to move forward in even an illegal

3798
02:51:03,689 --> 02:51:07,710
market here in California and that's

3799
02:51:05,670 --> 02:51:09,809
what's sad is the opportunities lost

3800
02:51:07,709 --> 02:51:12,688
because we have some very good people

3801
02:51:09,809 --> 02:51:16,260
but just by chance of we're wind and

3802
02:51:12,689 --> 02:51:17,189
fire went those chances are literally

3803
02:51:16,260 --> 02:51:19,978
gone up in smoke

3804
02:51:17,189 --> 02:51:22,859
no pun intended so anything that anybody

3805
02:51:19,978 --> 02:51:24,119
can contribute right now I know the big

3806
02:51:22,859 --> 02:51:25,890
problem is they have more than enough

3807
02:51:24,120 --> 02:51:28,800
stuff right now they need help

3808
02:51:25,889 --> 02:51:31,489
organizing and sifting through and

3809
02:51:28,799 --> 02:51:33,358
making sure this gets to that so I know

3810
02:51:31,489 --> 02:51:36,930
many of my employees actually

3811
02:51:33,359 --> 02:51:40,050
volunteered went up to various spots

3812
02:51:36,930 --> 02:51:43,470
yesterday just to do just that just to

3813
02:51:40,049 --> 02:51:45,119
separate clothes from sizes from just

3814
02:51:43,469 --> 02:51:47,039
trying to get things set so when people

3815
02:51:45,120 --> 02:51:50,340
can come they can actually distribute

3816
02:51:47,040 --> 02:51:51,120
this this stuff properly you know

3817
02:51:50,340 --> 02:51:53,040
because I don't

3818
02:51:51,120 --> 02:51:55,920
- just for it to be there it needs to be

3819
02:51:53,040 --> 02:51:58,021
distributed properly so that's gonna

3820
02:51:55,920 --> 02:51:59,670
take some time and it's not easy to do

3821
02:51:58,021 --> 02:52:02,101
and it's very frustrating and it takes

3822
02:51:59,670 --> 02:52:04,319
long hours so not only is stuff needed

3823
02:52:02,101 --> 02:52:06,780
your volunteerism in your time so if

3824
02:52:04,319 --> 02:52:09,539
you're able to be within an area and to

3825
02:52:06,780 --> 02:52:12,480
volunteer to come down they need help

3826
02:52:09,540 --> 02:52:15,030
you know these first responders you know

3827
02:52:12,479 --> 02:52:17,129
go buy them pizza go buy them coffee go

3828
02:52:15,030 --> 02:52:18,930
get them whatever you know I've see

3829

every little bit helps you know even if

3832
02:52:25,139 --> 02:52:30,270
it's just spare change that helps even

3833
02:52:27,930 --> 02:52:32,700
if it's signing petitions but as we're

3834

3837
02:52:36,479 --> 02:52:41,969

3838
02:52:38,040 --> 02:52:44,370
time for this to to change and for

3839
02:52:41,969 --> 02:52:46,199
people to recover and this is a time

3840
02:52:44,370 --> 02:52:48,061
where we have to take care of our own

3879
02:54:08,351 --> 02:54:11,470
getting food to people I thought that

3880
02:54:09,760 --> 02:54:12,670
was a really cool thing you don't have

3881
02:54:11,469 --> 02:54:14,649
to wait you don't have to you know

3882
02:54:12,670 --> 02:54:16,271
sometimes people don't want to wait you

3883
02:54:14,649 --> 02:54:18,659
want to do their own thing and that's

3884
02:54:16,271 --> 02:54:21,909
another great way of doing it too so

3885
02:54:18,659 --> 02:54:24,280
yeah and I think you know that's and

3886
02:54:21,909 --> 02:54:26,440
that's really really well put you know

3887

money to give sure everyone's struggling

3949

give you a job to do

3956
02:56:58,809 --> 02:57:04,568
that has direct real impact that you can

3957
02:57:02,889 --> 02:57:06,879
look back on at the end of the day and

3958
02:57:04,568 --> 02:57:11,019

3959
02:57:06,879 --> 02:57:13,358
them in some of these things and and and

3960
02:57:11,020 --> 02:57:15,430
also to you know in this time where you

3962
02:57:15,430 --> 02:57:19,479
artists where you know they don't

3963
02:57:17,829 --> 02:57:22,689
necessarily have a tremendous amount of

3964
02:57:19,478 --> 02:57:24,309
money to donate or have tons of cannabis

3965
02:57:22,689 --> 02:57:25,898
