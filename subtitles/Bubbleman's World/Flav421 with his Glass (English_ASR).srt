my favorit

the spiciness and the

151
00:06:35,598 --> 00:06:39,639
earthiness literally like I don't

152
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:40,918
personally know the heritage of the

153
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:43,038
strain I don't know where the strain

154
00:06:40,918 --> 00:06:45,240
originates from but it always reminds me

155
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:50,598
of being somewhere in like the poonian

156
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:52,598
or like tropical yet humid with a lot of

157

180
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:44,799
so oh look at this he he ran and got

181
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:48,079
some water so yeah this is an old

182
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:51,800
Slinger bowl from probably around

183
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:55,279
2000 maybe 2001 this was at a time when

184
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:57,360
I was trying to explain to rure that the

185
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:58,719
open Bowl wasn't really the concept that

186
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,000
they should be looking at for the

187
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,879
concentrate user the hash smoker we're

188
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,759
more into these pushed bowls with either

189
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,879
a single hole or a multi-hole so you can

190
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:08,919
use the herb iron or a product like that

191
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,720
totally butth this was sort of Slinger's

192
00:08:08,918 --> 00:08:12,680
response and I think it was honestly one

193
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,720
of his first like okay well let's uh

194
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,360
let's see what we

195
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,280

should mention that uh this this marble

214
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:05,360
here which I'm sure uh Mark will be uh

215
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:07,399
taking some photographs of is one of the

216
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,519
few pieces that's not actually done by

217
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:12,679
ghost on the piece it's a freak brain

218
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:15,799
marble and the Fume Tech in these brain

219
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:17,519
marbles is really Second To None I mean

220
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:18,799
it's a really really really cool design

221
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,679
it's a really really really cool feature

222
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:24,000
that freak was doing doesn't haven't

223
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:25,838
seen a lot of them done recently but um

224
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,799
it's you know one of the it's it really

225
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:29,920
helps make the piece in all honesty this

226
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:32,039
this I was just talking to the to the

227
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:33,679
screen about this brain marble by freak

228
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:35,319
it's the one of the attachments it's not

229
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:36,679
done isn't that just awesome theing on

230
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:39,920
super incredible

231
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:42,519
yeah I went and your wife gave me a

232
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:45,199
beine hemp light beautiful I was like so

233
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:48,078
it's got the beine on there through the

234
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,120
tube um I don't know who makes these but

235
00:09:48,078 --> 00:09:51,078
I picked them up um I can't even

236
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,320
remember where I picked them up but I

237
00:09:51,078 --> 00:09:54,958
just threw a bunch of the beine that I

238
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:57,040
got from on it's totally F it's a it's a

239
00:09:54,958 --> 00:10:00,359
pretty cool pretty cool we'll enjoy the

240
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:03,639
sweet skunk with the flame

241
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:06,399
rip oh

242
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:08,519
yeah good flamework good

243
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:11,078
flamework beine is definitely the

244
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:13,240
product of an experienced user if you

245
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:15,359
suck too hard you suck the beine out and

246
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,839
you'll get the smoke from the beine

247
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,240
there nothing you want to contaminate

248
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:22,360
your bowl with um if you don't suck hard

249
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,959
enough the flame doesn't grow properly

250
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,600
and it ends up going out it's really

251
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:27,359
quite a tricky sort of thing to just

252
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,759
simply light a bowl and then each bowl

253
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,480
is different how hard it pulls how hard

254
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:34,120
it chugs depending on the pipe that it's

255
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:37,720
on totally how much the indent goes it's

256
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:40,879
ridiculous so I were to compare the the

257
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:42,959
flame to to to to the low temp dab you

258
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:45,078
know more of the spiciness comes out in

259
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:46,278
the flame to whereas a lot more of the

260
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:49,278
like

261
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:51,639
um earthy tones come out in in in the

262
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:55,200
low temp da but it's funny because like

263
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:56,278
sweet skunk is such an amazing strain

264
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,759
just no matter like whether you're

265
00:10:56,278 --> 00:10:59,120
smoking the flowers whether you're

266
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:00,838
consuming the concentrates no matter

267
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,799
what it is it's just truly one of those

268
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:04,560
strains this is where it's so tasty

269
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:06,919
unbelievable isn't it cool it's really a

270
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:08,958
pipe that you could would almost like

271
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:10,319
not many people could hold this pipe

272
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:11,599
yeah it's aw in the sense that yeah it's

273
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,240
very awkward you wouldn't want to grab

274
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,240
it the wrong way you could break a piece

275
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:17,839
off you know what I mean especially

276
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,839
these like SP pie oh yeah

277
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,760
man and the wind comes up right at the

278
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:31,240
wrong

279
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:31,240
time but where're

280
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:38,199
sucess Ah that's a nice big crazy tube

281
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:40,679
that's a Halloween piece right there

282
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:42,200
dude y well I mean I'm bringing a few of

283
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:45,479
these pieces to Holland because as I'm

284
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:47,240
doing um an art display with the ding

285
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,720
Gallery excellent while we're there

286
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,759
that's cool and um so I thought that I'd

287
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:54,240
bring out some pieces that that maybe

288
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:56,360
weren't as publicly appreciated but

289
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,720
pieces that I personally thought just

290
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:01,039
have really cool artistic values to them

291
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,720
and different texts that were utilized

292
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:03,919
and used you know cuz a lot of these

293
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,680
there's not a lot of people that are

294
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:09,479
doing like electroforming as much as was

295
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:11,278
like 3 four years ago you know and ghost

296
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:14,680
ghost Brandon Martin like those guys

297
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:16,198
they really do exceptionally

298
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:19,638
cool

299
00:12:16,198 --> 00:12:21,479
mhm work I mean like I've seen so I've

300
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:23,278
seen so many pieces where the electro

301
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,800
forming almost ruins the piece you know

302
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:26,120
like I love the borrow I love the like I

303
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:27,958
love all the different tax and stuff

304
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,519
like that but it's it's almost like a

305
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:30,759
Gody expenditure like you know when

306
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:33,480
you're hanging out in New York and you

307
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:36,000
see some like Rich lady walking down the

308
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,800
street and she's just way overdone sort

309
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,120
of how I feel about some Electra form

310
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:43,439
Bor pieces and I think that like the

311
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:45,480
subtleties and the and the Styles and

312
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,959
times in which it's applied particularly

313
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,240
in Ghost and Brandon Martin like I was

314
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:49,958
saying I really think that their Texs

315
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,480
are awesome so I thought maybe you know

316
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:52,439
I'd bring them out and some of the guys

317
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,120
that are going to be hanging with us in

318
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:56,519
Holland will be able to experience this

319
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:58,039
killer all right well that's uh quite an

320
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:00,159
interesting piece for sure I like it

321
00:12:58,039 --> 00:13:01,838
with the Slinger Bowl on there yeah you

322
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:03,719
know doesn't the color scheme actually

323
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,920
quite match cuz even the yellowing and

324
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,440
the paing under here and stuff totally

325
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:09,319
oh yeah jeez I had the method seven

326
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,160
glasses on and I didn't realize uh the

327

00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:04,519
some more genetics in the garden

390
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,519
especially if they have Jamaican lineage

391
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:08,879
uh I

392
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:10,919
absolutely love resin um grown

393
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:13,318
particularly in Jamaica but I also love

394
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:15,559
Jamaican strains that have been shared

395
00:16:13,318 --> 00:16:17,240
out of Jamaica that we can now grow you

396
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:18,479
know here in our own country so I have

397
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:21,120
one right around the corner there

398
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,720
growing with the Congo always nice to

399
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,399
have a couple of those out on the deck

400
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:28,480
and uh yeah I don't know I guess we're

401
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:31,278
just waiting on Flav to get back with uh

402
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:33,079
the mar cell Phoenix he's just putting a

403
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:36,078
whack of water in it and we're going to

404
00:16:33,078 --> 00:16:38,919
load it up so I think we'll load that up

405
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:43,159
with this particular batch I have two

406
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:46,120
batches of sweet skunk first

407
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:48,600
pass I like to call it not to be

408
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:53,318
confused with first

409
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:56,159
bounce and yeah first pass time

410
00:16:53,318 --> 00:17:00,120
okay so here we

411
00:16:56,159 --> 00:17:02,679
go all right so yeah you have shown back

412
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:04,759
up with the Marcel full of water and

413
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:07,359
I've pulled aside the two first passes

414
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:09,439
that I was mentioning the first pass uh

415
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:13,078
being what I would call the first

416
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:16,079
quality of um of dry sift that I'm able

417
00:17:13,078 --> 00:17:19,480
to make this is the pure of the pure MH

418
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:22,399
and it's a nice you know beautiful pure

419
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:25,000
unadulterated heads so I think you is

420
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,839
the best thing to [ __ ] be toen on

421
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,038
yeah I think so do you have a preference

422
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:31,720
there that you'd like to um no honestly

423
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:34,119
pick just whichever whichever is clever

424
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:37,000
I have a bit of a a I can't stick a

425
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:38,439
dirty Dabber into clean dry sift so no I

426
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,160
always just give it a swipe on the

427
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:42,640
denail and then clean it that way with

428
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,880
my fingers and then you're rubbing

429
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,799
you're actually getting that medicine

430
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,280
into your skin still affecting your

431
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:50,279
endoc cannaboid

432
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:51,440
system much like in the same way Rick

433
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:54,879
Simpson

434
00:17:51,440 --> 00:18:00,038
oilwood so here we go nice big fresh

435
00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:01,799
heady hit like look at this

436
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:04,119
yeah look at the Crystal on

437
00:18:01,798 --> 00:18:05,119
that nothing like killing unicorns and

438
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:07,959
smoking

439
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:11,038
diamonds unicorn

440
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:14,440
tears a tiny little bit of unicorn tears

441
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:17,200
tried to escape I think not you will die

442
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,200
too I think

443
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:23,319
not

444
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:29,440
awesome what a beautiful thing a dry

445
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:32,519
that melts on that level just turning to

446
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:36,360
nothing almost zero Ash just a nice

447
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:39,119
light Ash it liquifies yeah just

448
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:41,759
straight liquid isn't that great that is

449

to move that guy over and we'll give

453
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:55,839
this one the uh Center Stage that she so

454
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:57,759
deserves yes this piece it's it's I I've

455
00:18:55,839 --> 00:19:00,038
actually found it quite amusing how

456
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:02,200
often it uh comes back into the rotation

457
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:03,640
these days when we're puffing cuz it was

458
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,558
one of those pieces that when I acquired

459
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:07,440
it like it was a piece that I always

460
00:19:05,558 --> 00:19:08,759
wanted it since I saw it in the release

461
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:12,558
of smoke Volume

462
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:14,038
2 um never thought I would um so I kind

463
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:15,359
of never thought that I'd bring it out I

464
00:19:14,038 --> 00:19:17,400
never thought that it would be a piece

465
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:19,719
that i' I'd puff on regularly you know I

466
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:21,919
thought maybe the octopus would have

467
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:24,519
some fragility to it but you know the

468
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:26,280
way Marcel does his pieces the way

469
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:28,359
they're tacked together right in here

470
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:30,319
and back here and over here and over

471
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:32,599
here there I have to say it it's

472
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:34,359
reminiscent of my old Marcel pieces and

473
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:36,399
I'm super comfortable around this piece

474
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:38,279
I don't mind you know going boating with

475
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,440
it I don't mind carrying it or walking

476
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:42,279
with it it's it's my Marcel pieces I

477
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:44,120
used to take everywhere MH and not even

478
00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:47,158
with any Pelican case or anything like

479
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:48,879
for years I had that thing in like a box

480
00:19:47,159 --> 00:19:49,960
with peanuts and stuff I just feel like

481
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,960
put it on the front seat be like yeah

482
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,480
I'm going to take this down to like

483
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,600
Grassroots on Commercial Drive we're

484
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:58,000
going to Puff it for a bunch of hours so

485
00:19:55,599 --> 00:20:00,000
that's how we did it and it worked out

486
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,359
rather well

487
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,400
all right Mr Phoenix this is such a

488
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:07,678
great

489
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:10,919
