Hey, welcome to Bubble Man's World,

3
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:27,118
guys. What a beautiful day it is today

4
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,240
in British Columbia. It's Wednesday,

5
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:33,439
which is Puff Wednesday, but I had John

6
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:34,960
uh message me yesterday and tell me that

7
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:38,320
he's not going to be able to make Puff

8
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:40,239
Wednesday. So, of course, I um was

9
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,159
completely blown away at the at the idea

10
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:44,320
of not having Puff Wednesday with John.

11
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:46,398
So, I asked him what's going on. Well,

12
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,320
he's got a bit of a journey today. He's

13
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,160
um shipping off some of his mother

14
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,520
plants to one of the companies that he's

15
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:53,038
been hired to work with, one of the

16
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,440
licensed producers. He's helping them

17
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,960
get some strains. And so I'm going to go

18
00:00:55,439 --> 00:01:00,238
over there. We're going to have a little

19
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:03,120
session. We're going to um go down to

20
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:04,878
Green Planet and wrap these mothers up.

21
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:07,039
Uh we're going to go down to Megaill

22
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,520
Pizza for a nice little session and you

23
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,360
know dail session and a pizza. And then

24
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:13,118
we're going to make our way down the the

25
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:16,079
airport and we're going to send these

26
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:18,000
strains off to I'm not even sure where,

27
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:21,280
but I'm sure John will uh let us know

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,920
what's going on. For now, listening to

29
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,439
John N's new album, New Name. You can

30
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,439
pick that up on iTunes. You can listen

31
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:31,438

32
00:01:28,438 --> 00:01:33,478

33
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:36,239

34
00:01:33,478 --> 00:01:38,319
really I'm digging her tunes a lot these

35
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:40,319

36
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:45,039
Hitman rip with you. Got my baby cakes

37
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:46,879

38
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,640
always tells me he loves loves when I

39
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:50,239
mention his dry sift. And I, you know, I

40
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,759
mention it because it's wonderful stuff.

41
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:57,859
And I mention it because I'm smoking it

42
00:01:52,759 --> 00:02:01,920

that's where he

69
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,879

103
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:54,560
go in the house, have a session. We

104
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,720
might come back out here and do a little

105
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,959
tour of his jard.

106

108
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,000
We've we've made it up to John's kitchen

109
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,880
and he's about to show me his fridge.

110
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,639
What have you done with your fridge

111
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:11,360
here, John? Well, what's happened is is

112
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,879
the top um isn't working properly. So,

113
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,400
the freezer works quite well, but the

114
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:16,159
fans worked out, so it keeps it nice and

115
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:18,239
cool. And I have a fridge downstairs for

116
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,720
everything. So, um the best part about

117
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,879
this fridge is because it's my 420

118
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,800
fridge. So, basically, I got all my

119
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:28,159
different hashes. I got my weeds. I got

120
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:31,439
my caps. I got my Haley's that I bred. I

121
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:33,919
like how you have all your hash on the

122
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:37,279
top shelf. And all the killers right

123
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:39,120
here. Top shelf. Top shelf. Uh, could we

124
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:42,239
pull something off this top shelf

125
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:45,639
perhaps? John, I I I have the Ooh. Oh,

126
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:48,160
that looks pretty upside down. Look at

127
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:49,680
that. Nice.

128
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,039
Good job on the sifties. Good jobs on

129
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,319
the sifties. What do you got there? Oh,

130
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:57,918

00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,919
watermelon that we did on your birthday?

145
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,680
Yes. Well, I haven't smoked it. I've

146
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:33,279
been saving it for you to come smoke it.

147
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,879
Now, let's check out that hos. That's

148
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:38,239

149
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:38,240

150
00:07:38,598 --> 00:07:44,918

Okay. Well, I'll do that. I'll do that.

162
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,598
actually commenting on some stuff last

163
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,280
night on Facebook and they wanted to

164
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:17,120
know if they could dab dry served or

165
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:18,959
fresh frozen and I was like if it's a

166
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,879
full milk quality, of course you can.

167
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:22,079
Yeah. So, we're going to show you those

168
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,840

169
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:25,839

170
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:29,758

172
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,120
That's nice. I know. I like to sit and

173
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,879
relax and it's always a beautiful view

174
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,278
out the window here and I normally have

175
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:40,038
the cats outside. I'll put a little awa

176
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:42,719
in the hitman. Awa. And when I say a

177
00:08:40,038 --> 00:08:45,278
little, it's like two drops is all he's

178
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:48,240
putting in there. It's It's quite a

179
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:49,838
great little pipe that we're doing. I

180
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,839
got the big torch underneath there.

181
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,399
Yeah. I got to get the guys um check out

182

walls, the whole nine yards. and they

188
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:09,120
actually were the ones that hooked me up

189
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:12,399
with this little piece. And uh they're

190
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,759
also uh distributors and wholesalers of

191

bubble bags. And they also have some

192
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:18,559
medainers. Okay. So, I'm hitting that

193
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:20,479
watermelon. Yeah, they're definitely on

194

198
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:34,879
90. Beautiful. Beautiful. Maybe I'll let

199
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:38,000
you heat that up and I'll just Oh man,

200
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:42,720
this is nice. Just a beautiful color.

201
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,639
The color is literally still white.

202
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,000
It leaning off twice. That one hair

203
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:50,480
already found its way in. Yeah. Look at

204
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,919
that. E like the one hair. Anyone that

205
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,080
smokes full melt, anyone that

206
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:55,519
particularly takes macro photographs and

207
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,080
really gets in there, you understand

208
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:00,159
quickly that

209
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:02,639
um it's incredible how easy it is for

210
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:03,600
hair to contaminate and get in. So, I'm

211
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:05,679
going to hit it right in the front

212
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:09,000
there. It's all nice and hot. Dan, thank

213
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:09,000
you so much.

214
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,720
And a full milk quality. You can see the

215
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:19,000
clear domes from here. And that's always

216
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,000
a good sign. That's my fave.

217
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:24,480
My cat would like to say hello. He's

218
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:26,480
decided to let yummy. Morpheus. No,

219
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,639
normally it's Oreo, but today it's gonna

220
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,639
be Morpheus.

221
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:34,159
My goodness. Is that a You know what the

222
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:36,480
smell of that? I was explaining to

223
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:39,278
another guy yesterday on how the foam

224
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,879
milk quality is is just so much more

225
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:42,320
actually better for medicating and

226
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:44,159
stuff. if I had a nice little interview

227
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:47,600
with the Vancouver Sun and we went all

228
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:50,559
about Tricombo hatches and and and and

229
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,560
how are they able to

230
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:57,679
actually some of the house car actually

231
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:59,919
do the 90 anything you want save this I

232
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:03,039
got some D420K in the house as well we I

233
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:05,360
ran out of D420K well I had quite a bit

234
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:07,838
so I think I managed to hold on a little

235
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,680
bit

236
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,120
it's kind of nice being able to uh be

237
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:13,519
able to puff

238
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,879
always the corn. Here, I'll light that

239
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,039
up. Here's John that doesn't know how to

240
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:19,039
operate torch cuz I never use one. Yeah,

241
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:20,958
I was the same way. I was like, here,

242
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:22,399
I'll light it up for you. Another thing

243
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:25,759
that people will say right away, like,

244
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:27,039
don't do this, but do this. Okay. And

245
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:28,799
then they've also, well, they've been

246
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:31,519
giving me all sorts of tips on YouTube

247
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:32,799
because I'm not a big torture and you

248
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,560
know, you got to be at this part of the

249
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:38,078
flame and that. I'm just like, okay,

250
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:40,159
whatever makes it red fastest seems to

251
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:42,000
work. What's nice is just a little tiny

252
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:44,879
size. It's just the right size. Right

The surprise of the day. The surprise of

292
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:12,480
the point. What could be Bubble Man?

293
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:15,360
What could Bubble Man and John be up to?

294
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,519
What could we be up to?

295
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,519
It is Puff Wednesday. We do some pretty

296
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:22,000
crazy things on Puff Wednesday. But

297
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,278
mostly what we do, everything is legal,

298
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,958
and that's the most important part.

299
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:27,519
We're not doing anything illegal here.

300
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:29,278
We're actually uh um showing you

301
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,440
different methods of medicating and

302
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:34,000
different ways of dealing with uh a

303
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,399
plant. And safety first, like turning

304
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,078
off the torch is important. So you don't

305
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,440
burn. I was impressed you knew how to

306
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:42,319
turn off. I I learned how to turn it

307
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,519
off. It says off. I like the off button

308
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:48,320
turning. It doesn't say on. It says lock

309
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:50,159
on. But you know it's okay.

310
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,920
All right. Let me get that there. And

311
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:55,519
this might be that was some Homa. Hi.

312
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:58,799
Hi.

313
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:00,560
Very tasty. Very very tasty. Well, look

314
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:02,000
at all the two. You know this one is

315
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:03,838
yours and that one is yours. Yeah, I

316
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,679
brought these two. So, I know I have

317
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:10,240
these two because we we seem to um I

318
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:12,239
lost all mine. So, it's the question is

319
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,000
mood at this point because all mine got

320
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,600
lost and these ones are brand new and I

321
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,440
literally only got them yesterday or the

322
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,000

336
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:51,278
choke. Yes, absolutely. I will torch

337
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:52,879
your mail for you, sir. So, I mean, what

338
00:14:51,278 --> 00:14:54,000
do you guys do on your puff Wednesdays?

339
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:55,439
You know, we like to hear those

340
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,440
comments. I mean, everybody's got their

341
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,800
little thing and we started a you know

342
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,240
that everybody's got one thing. We like

343
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:03,120
our puff Wednesdays because it gives us

344
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,278
a time to um enjoy and uh get together

345
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,120
and well actually we get together more

346
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:09,039
than on Wednesdays. It's true. It seems

347
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,839
to be Wednesday, Friday, Saturday,

348
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:13,679
Monday, Tuesday. Yeah, I I actually got

349
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:15,760
my cot in the basement. It was it was

350
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:17,838
it's quite nice. A hammock. I have the

351
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:19,679
hammock on the top. You might see that

352
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,120
uh the new hammock that uh Let's see if

353
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:22,559
we can give you this one real quick cuz

354
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,440
it's not hot enough. I think I should do

355
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:29,599
it. If you don't hit it right in the

356
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,600
right spot when it's not there, perfect.

357
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:37,360
Perfecto. And the torch just wings out.

358
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:39,278
So, we're going to head down to I guess

359
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,399
the Best Western for some breakfast cuz

360
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:44,879
we're starving. We'll come back and uh

361
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,559
cut some clones and we'll see you guys

362
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:49,439
here in a little bit. And this is the

363
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:52,239
guy that's scratching so much. This was

364
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,320

365
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,320
Hey, beautiful. You going to rip the

366
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,560
trippy? Obviously, I'm going to do the

367
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,000
five turn on first. It's really

368
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:01,879
important that you always have the

369
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,919
trippy on first. Can I hear you,

370
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:05,519
mumbler? I said you really got to make

371
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:07,919
sure the trippy's on first. I think the

372
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:10,240
five point Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

373
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:10,240
Sweet,

374
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:15,759
sweet. I got mine as well. You know,

375
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,559
after breakfast, it's always nice to

376
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,680
have a nice little rip.

377
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:20,958
Well, you want to head back to your

378
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:22,638
place? I think it's time to get back to

379
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:26,479
the house. All right, let's do it. Yeah,

380
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:26,480
let's do it, man. We're on our way out.

381
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:33,600
And I guess that was a great breakfast.

382
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:39,159
Just in John's neighborhood here. Where

383
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:39,159
too, John? For the truck and uh

384
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:44,638
All right. See you there. Going to be in

385
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:49,278
his basement set up. He's got his giant

386
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:51,839
TV. License for sending. License for

387
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:53,360
sending. I'm I'm actually um doing a

388
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,360
transport. And this is the exciting

389
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,120
part. Canada interact marijuana

390
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,440
chettney. This is the whole license and

391
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:02,560
everything that we're sending that goes

392
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,160
along with um Health Canada. All right,

393
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:06,958
we got we got the approval, man. All

394
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,240
right. Well, let's print that off. Yeah.

395
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,919
So, that's what we're looking for. We're

396
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,640
looking for approvals in order to

397
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:14,720
transfer um my strain to a licensed

398
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,880
producer. So, in the future, we're able

399
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,759
to get actually my strain medic that

400
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,199
works so well for me. And when you know,

401
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:22,400
god forbid if there's ever a time that I

402
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,000
can't grow my medicine, at least I'll be

403
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,640
able to access my strain and I will

404
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,599
never lose my strain. So right now I am

405
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:31,759
proceeding with

406
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:34,719
um sending my strain to an LP so they

407
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:36,480
can grow uh standardized medic kush for

408
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,720
medical patients. They'll be using my

409
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,679
feeding program, hang drying, and it'll

410
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,919
be purely organic garden. So um and

411
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:46,000
that's all in contracts with lawyers and

412
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:48,640
stuff like that so they don't uh try and

413
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,558
take away what I do for you. So yeah,

414
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,320
it's just uh another it's a good way to

415
00:17:50,558 --> 00:17:53,918
preserve your genetics. Yeah, it's

416
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:55,918
really important to me because I really

417
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,759
so need these genetics for my pain

418
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,600
control and and with this whole system,

419
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:01,839
it's really scared, you know, I'm

420
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:03,439
scared. So I mean, I want to make sure

421
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:05,839
like that the genetics that I've worked

422
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,519
so hard on are able to be able to access

423
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:09,279
uh for the rest of my life. So this is

424
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:11,519
this is me doing this right now and it's

425
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:13,359
been going on now for about 3 months.

426
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:14,960
So, it's a lot of work and a lot of

427
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:16,479
patience with letters back and forth to

428
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,919

something that um I know no one else has

449
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,640
done. And what strains other than

450

00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:20,079
No. Um the other strains are um you know

453
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:21,599
they're uh this is what works for me.

454
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:23,918
This is what uh people have been sought

455
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:25,199
after and you know uh because uh the

456
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:26,880
strains work so well and we've done

457
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,558
testing results on it over the years

458
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,679
working with Dr. Hornby and finding all

459
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:33,279
the ecasies on how cannabis has affected

460
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,480
me. This is the strain that works and so

461
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:39,319
this is the strain that we want to get

462
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:39,319
to patients. Awesome dude.

463
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:45,839
And there it is. It just says here it's

464
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,280
authorized manager of license permission

465
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:49,199
office of substance control act on

466
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:52,319
behalf of the minister on March 27th

467
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:56,000
that I'm able to transfer my plants from

468
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:57,918
my place here to um my numbers are all

469
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,919
here. So everything is in conjunction

470
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:02,559
and this is the paperwork and I'm just

471

going to put an envelope and that's it.

472
00:20:02,558 --> 00:20:06,079
And then if um cops come well I guess we

473
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,839
got the paperwork, right? Dude, I can't

474

here ready. Perfect. We're going to put

480
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:22,798
some water in here. We figured it'd just

481
00:20:21,038 --> 00:20:24,960
be easier to come inside and work with

482
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:26,720
the the tap here and and then show you

483
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,880
how we actually put water in our little

484
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,880
tube so we can transport some home for

485
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,720
you because of course you want to have a

486
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,000
couple of cuts of your string. Yes. Yes.

487
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,720
The watermelon. Yeah. I'd love to bring

488
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,400
the Astro Boy home again. Well, you are.

489
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,480
So, as you can see, these are the plants

490
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,798
that you have in flower. These are the

491
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:45,440
same these were the same from the eight

492
00:20:42,798 --> 00:20:47,679
cuts. I mean, since 12 cuts that were

493
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:50,798
rooted, and then I flipped eight of

494
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:52,000
them. Mhm. And uh we uh saw four of

495
00:20:50,798 --> 00:20:53,759
those. We'll be seeing four more of

496
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,200
those. We've already uh did fresh frozen

497
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:57,279
on your birthday with four of them.

498
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,798
Yeah. I've got four. Yeah. You've got

499
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:00,079
you got you got those. And well, here's

500
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:02,000
the last two. And these are our main

501
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:03,519
moms. So today we're going to take some

502
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,119
cuts from this watermelon boy. And right

503
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:06,400
now I always like to just start with a

504
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:08,798
little bit of warm water cuz it just

505
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,480
works out really nice. And of course,

506
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:12,798
you know, you got to kind of let it heat

507
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,480
up a tiny bit. It just goes quicker to

508
00:21:12,798 --> 00:21:16,480
make it warm. Yes. If you make it warm,

509
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,720
it's a lot quicker. So, all right. So,

510
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,919
we've got our

511
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:22,038
pucks. John's going to pour the hot

512
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:24,720
water over top of them. This will

513
00:21:22,038 --> 00:21:26,240
speed. Warm water. The warm water. You

514
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,919
can see them getting bigger already.

515
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,000
Yeah. It just takes seconds this way.

516
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:32,480
And then we get lots of uh That's just

517
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,200
how I like to do my things. Sure.

518
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,960
Quicker and easier. Yeah, we'll just let

519
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,440
them cool down. We're not going to jam

520
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:41,798
fresh cut clones into the the steaming

521
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:45,679
water. But uh yeah, that was nice and

522
00:21:41,798 --> 00:21:45,679
quick. Get those pucks

523
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:52,158
all. I do this and then I'll put it into

524
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:56,798
the dome, which I normally do outside,

525
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:58,320
but uh this is a lot nicer to see. Mhm.

526
00:21:56,798 --> 00:21:59,759
It happens pretty quick and then at the

527
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:01,038
same time I can just kind of work over.

528
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:03,839
Yeah, that water is certainly not that

529
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:05,519
warm. No, it looks it's steaming on the

530
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:08,480
camera so it really makes the water look

531
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:10,400
much warmer. No, it's not that.

532
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:14,159
All right, so next up, some clone

533
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,159
cutting. I always like to

534
00:22:14,679 --> 00:22:20,720
um Doesn't hurt to put on some gloves,

535
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:21,210
you know. It uh Absolutely. It's always

536
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,308
on.

537
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:24,308
[Music]

538
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:30,759
Absolutely. Little clage on the

539
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:33,120
watermelons, eh? Yeah. Got it.

540
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:35,158
Excellent. So, me personally, I was

541
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:38,759
going to get you your

542
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:42,000
tubes. Yes. Oh, just stepped

543
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:44,400
on cracker. Cracker dagger. I'm going to

544
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,240
move our camera angle a little bit and

545
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,440
uh start with you taking a few and I'll

546
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,880
show them up close what you're doing

547
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,400
there.

548
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,760
So, right here is I'm just going to

549
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,679
reach in here. You can see there. And I

550
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:56,558
just just kind of peel it right off the

551
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:58,720
stock here. So, it's a little pinch and

552
00:22:56,558 --> 00:22:59,720
it peels. And I can get to cut it right

553
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,759
off the

554
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:03,360
stock. All right. That was a little bit

555
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:04,879
hard to see, but perfect. But what I

556
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:06,719
have is I have this perfect little tap

557
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,000
routt right in there. Excellent. All

558
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,919
right. And I always like that. And I

559
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,679
just kind of shave it off a little bit

560
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,440
so it's nice and clean. And And then

561
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:15,960
from there, well, for now, we're going

562
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:19,200
to put it into these tubes.

563
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:20,640
Okay. No. No gel at all. Well, not right

564
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,840
now because actually we're going to send

565
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,520
this home with you and then you're going

566
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:25,038
to use that rooting gel that you brought

567
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:26,720
in there from Remo. You know, when I

568
00:23:25,038 --> 00:23:29,119
learned how to cut clones no matter

569
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,720
what, whenever I cut the clone, in fact,

570
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:33,038
one of the most successful cloners that

571
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:35,679
ever showed me this trick used to take

572
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:38,158
thousands of clones a day. And he used

573
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:40,000
scissors and he cut them super fast. It

574
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,880
was unbelievable. But he dipped his

575
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,798
scissors in rooting gel. And well, what

576
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:48,480
he said was when he cut the clone,

577
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:51,200
instead of oxygen accessing the fresh

578
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:55,038
breach, you know that it's gelled up,

579
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:57,120
which he's not using the gel at first

580
00:23:55,038 --> 00:24:00,000
um to get roots to grow. He's using it

581
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:01,678
to seal it instantly. That's I liked it,

582
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
too. And even as I watched you take that

583
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:06,080
and hold it in the air, I'm sure these

584
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,599
these plants are so hardy, you could

585
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:09,918
probably put that clone in the fridge

586
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:12,000
the way it is for 2 or 3 months and it

587
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:14,720
would still bloody grow. I've seen it

588
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,798
happen in plastic bags. I've seen clones

589
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,079
like that. Looks so nice. I know. It

590
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:19,440
really looks nice. And look how happy

591
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:22,000
you look, John. Yeah. I know. Well, it's

592
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,440
because I I I take pride in doing this.

593
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,798
You know what? It's a high five stuff.

594
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,038
Yeah, it is. I mean, look at that. I

595
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:28,879
mean, this is my little lab. Yeah. Yeah.

596
00:24:27,038 --> 00:24:30,640
You know, I'm very sterile. I take good

597
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,559
care of what I do and stuff like that.

598
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,080
And we work on doing things properly.

599
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:35,519
But, I mean, hey, you did them the best

600
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:37,119
you can. And I think you're doing it

601
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:39,119
pretty damn good, bro. I have a good

602
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:40,719
time. Keep working away here. Yeah.

603
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:42,199
You've got your one. Why don't you cut

604
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,640
uh cut a few

605
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,480
more? Get this guy out of the way so we

606
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,080
can kind of see what you're doing this

607
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,599
time around. This you're coming in on

608
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:51,839
this one. I'm going to go right here.

609
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:54,798
Okay. I'll just kind of I just peel it

610
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:56,639
right off of there. Yep. Cut the

611
00:24:54,798 --> 00:24:59,278
right. Yeah. And it works for you. So

612
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:01,360
that's like what's I get 100% success

613
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:02,798
rate on my rooting all the time.

614
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:04,798
Perfect. So you know what? I'm doing

615
00:25:02,798 --> 00:25:06,639
something right. Hey, if it ain't broke,

616
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:08,079
don't fix it. There's always a different

617
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,919
way to do it. Everybody's got different

618
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:13,359
ways. This is what works for me. And

619
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:18,480
this was shown by an old friend um who

620
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:20,079
uh well, he gets 100% success rate, too.

621
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,000
Fill her up like this. So, we know we

622
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:24,798
got her in good standing. And put the

623
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,720
lid on. And we got another little clone.

624
00:25:24,798 --> 00:25:28,720
And we got a nice little clone. Now,

625
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,480
normally what I would do, me personally,

626
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,839
is I get a little black felt pen and I

627
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,360
write on there because normally when I

628
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:35,599
take clones, I take about six or seven

629
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:37,918
different strains, right? So, that's why

630
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:39,839
I always do like four, four, and four.

631
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:41,679
All right. Here you go. Oh, thank you,

632
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:43,918
sir. And then we're keeping it right in

633
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:46,798
our little bin of um actually um

634
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:47,919
leftover volcano. It's always on. One

635
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:49,440
thing I like about the volcano,

636
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:52,080
honestly, I haven't turned this thing

637
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:54,240
off in months. It's just always there.

638
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:55,839
Perfect. Convenient.

639
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,960
Oh, look at this beautiful one right

640
00:25:55,839 --> 00:25:58,000
here. You know, I'm going to come in and

641
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,960
cut this because I'm going to show you

642
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,960
what I'm going to do here because we're

643
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,600
going to see this keep growing. So, I'm

644
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,960
going to come

645
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:06,879
in and I'm just going to cut this

646
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,720
straight off here. And that's going to

647
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:11,600
continue growing perfectly. A couple of

648
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,519
growth spurts. Nice big clone. Nice big

649
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:15,918
clone. I'm going to leave this for you.

650
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:18,400
So, you can cut it on a 45. So, I always

651
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:20,080
cut just below there. Mhm. So, you know

652
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,440
what? And that rooting gel, if I had

653
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:23,678
that, that work really well. But, we're

654
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:26,000
going right into water right now. But,

655
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:27,278
uh, like you say, it seals it. So, um,

656
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,759
it's something that I'm definitely going

657
00:26:27,278 --> 00:26:31,119
to try next time. That's for sure. All

658
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:32,400
right. I'm going to get to cutting a few

659
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:35,599
clones here. I'm going to put the camera

660
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:37,600
down. All right. And you want me to go

661
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:38,959
just into the cup for? But yeah, we're

662
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:40,079
going to take some I'm going to put them

663
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,159
on here and I was going to take them

664
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:43,918
outside. That's why I had the cup here.

665
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:45,760
Perfectly. But instead, we're we're

666
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,440
going to go right into here. And that's

667
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:49,200
really good. And what we don't have Do

668
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,120
you have that Remo's rooting gel that

669
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,880
you I wanted to try? Yes, it's right

670
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:56,798
here.

671
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:59,200
Boom. Remo's Roots cloning gel. So Remo

672
00:26:56,798 --> 00:27:02,000
gave this to me just a few days ago or

673
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,240
sorry, a few weeks ago. This one has not

674
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,960
been opened

675
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:10,798
yet. It is the gooey blue. It is the

676
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:12,480
gooey blue. Yeah. So, um we're going to

677
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:15,200
give uh probably enough right on the lid

678
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:17,038
there. That is perfect, actually. So,

679
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,798
for me, what I always like to do is I

680
00:27:17,038 --> 00:27:22,480
always like to like squish them out a

681
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:24,000
little bit so they're not so So,

682
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,720
yeah. No, totally makes sense. Yeah,

683
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,880
just a little bit. No, too much. What?

684
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:31,120
Like barely squeezed.

685
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,880
I was just bugging you.

686
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:34,639
I was like, "Oh, too much." You're

687
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,000
freaking me out. Yeah. I had I had to do

688
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,759
that, too. You did it just perfectly.

689
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,319
Just enough so they're, you know,

690
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:41,919
they're not too wet, but uh wet enough

691
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:43,439
that I don't have to actually go on and

692
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:45,200
add water to these cuz once I put these

693
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,120
in the dome outside, which we're going

694
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,798
to go do that once we're finished here.

695
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:54,278
Um you're going to see

696
00:27:49,798 --> 00:27:57,200
uh what I mean. Perfect. There we go.

697
00:27:54,278 --> 00:27:58,558
So, I'm I'm just going to I'm getting

698
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,038
right in here. I'm really looking

699
00:27:58,558 --> 00:28:03,278
forward to this. I saw this make some

700
00:28:01,038 --> 00:28:06,158
more cuts. Yeah. All right. Well, I'm

701
00:28:03,278 --> 00:28:08,240
going to do my uh tried and true method

702
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:10,520
of my old school dish. I'm actually

703
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:13,440
going to wait for that. I feel like

704
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:15,359
gelcoated scissors. You know, it's just

705
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,919
not a bad idea. What you're doing is

706
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:20,959
you're just

707
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:22,200
sealing the cut with gel pretty much as

708
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:26,480
you make

709
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:29,840
it. So, and you go. That's a nice one

710
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:32,720
right there. We'll leave one growth.

711
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:35,678
There you go. I did a peel while he was

712
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,798
doing that from underneath.

713
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:37,840
You got to put in gel there first, my

714
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:39,599
friend. Oh, yeah. Well, I kind of

715
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:41,519
already did. Oh. Oh, that's right, too.

716
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:42,959
You already did that method, which is

717
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:44,639
kind of cool. See, it's something that's

718
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,919
new. Something that I haven't done

719
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,640
before. And that's really nice working

720
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:51,440
with uh with you, dude. Yeah, man. We're

721
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:57,320
doing it. We're doing it up here. We go.

722
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:57,320
Nice and gentle. And we go in there.

723
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:04,158
That one's not too nice. Let's go in one

724
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:05,759
that's actually open. There we go. So, a

725
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:07,278
lot of times what I didn't do is

726
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:09,200
normally I put the little scissor in the

727
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:12,319
top there. Well, this one I think you

728
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:14,960
did. Uh, this one's nice and open. That

729
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:16,480
one I tried was quite open. So, I don't

730
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,880
know if you want to cut those bottom

731
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:21,200
leaves off there. We're going to get cut

732
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:23,039
that there. Put them right there. And

733
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,640
we're going to take about how many I

734
00:29:23,038 --> 00:29:26,319
think I'm going to do? one. I like to do

735
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:29,840
four per light. So, I'm going to do two

736
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:33,599
lights. Going to take eight nice cones.

737
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:35,199
All right. Cos. Are you got those? Take

738
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:38,038
one a little bit smaller. I went a

739
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:42,919
little little big on that

740
00:29:38,038 --> 00:29:45,359
one. Went a little big, but hey, you

741
00:29:42,919 --> 00:29:46,880
know, we'll go for a nice little Oh,

742
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:49,879
look at that little one. Now, that's

743
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,880
nice.

744
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:56,879
There we go. You need that. I'm not

745
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:58,480
using that. I'm a peeler guy. Yeah, you

746
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,240
got the peel going. I got the peel going

747
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,440
on. It's It's like I said, it's what

748
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,359
works really well for me and it's what

749
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:05,278
I've been doing for years and I'm not

750
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:08,639
trying to grow great big moms. So, me

751
00:30:05,278 --> 00:30:10,558
peeling. Um enables me to uh get some

752
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,000
nice little Oh, look at that. I like

753
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:13,519
little baby ones. I figure they they

754
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,200
would very well. But, you know, a couple

755
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:16,639
of nice ones are are never going to be a

756
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,919
problem either. It's always Oh, no.

757
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,480
They're always nice. Always nice to have

758
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:22,640
those guys. Nice to be cutting clones

759
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,759
and working with you today, John. It's

760
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,759
kind of something we've never done

761
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:27,278
before, dude. Puff Wednesdays. We're

762
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:28,960
always trying to mix it up. You know,

763
00:30:27,278 --> 00:30:30,480
it's it's it's this is the best way.

764
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,759
Show me. This is how I do mine. You know

765
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,798
what? Everybody's got different methods

766
00:30:31,759 --> 00:30:34,798
and everybody's got different

767
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:36,558
techniques. Um but you know what I would

768
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:38,158
do with this? I know. I got to just cut

769
00:30:36,558 --> 00:30:41,119
it like right there. Yeah, I'm thinking

770
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:44,480
so as well. Yeah.

771
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:46,239
Boom. Look at that. This is a beautiful

772
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,798
strip that bottom leaf off. Give it a

773
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:51,679
little dip. Going to go like that and

774
00:30:48,798 --> 00:30:52,960
like that. Perfect. Dipping it again.

775
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:54,798
And it's already being dipped once

776
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,240
before because he's decided to put the

777
00:30:54,798 --> 00:30:59,679
root gel on the scissors, which I think

778
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:01,359
is a great idea. I mean, me I would

779
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:03,120
usually use, okay, I'll be honest, a

780
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:04,240
much cleaner pair of scissors, not

781
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:05,918
scissors that have been used for

782
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,319
trimming. I would use a brand new pair

783
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:10,080
of clean scissors, dip it in rooting

784
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:11,839
gel. I probably would have cleaned it

785
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:13,519
each time. I've already contaminated

786
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:15,678
this with that. We'll have to wipe this

787
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:18,000
clean before we put it on top there. But

788
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:19,519
just those are normally how I would do

789
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,720
it. Yeah. I just realized that when I

790
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:22,918
grabbed the scissors, they weren't

791
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:25,919
looking all that

792
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:25,919
nice.

793
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:31,119
So, it's okay. They're still going to do

794
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:32,240
the job. Can I borrow those scissors for

795
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:35,759
a second? Yes. I'm going to put them in

796
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:39,240
the gel for one quick sec. There you go.

797
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:41,158
There you go. Take off that

798
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:45,839
leafy that

799
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:47,278
leafy with the dipin. This is nice.

800
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:49,439
They're used to be used to be working in

801
00:31:47,278 --> 00:31:49,440
the

802
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:54,480
jardan. Working in the jardan and making

803
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:56,679
clones.

804
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:59,679
One more for the for the road. I think

805
00:31:56,679 --> 00:32:02,159
I've five, six, seven. Hey, there we go.

806
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:03,519
Cuz uh I'm going to do two lights. And

807
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:05,919
uh we're definitely going to be hashing

808
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:07,919
this in about 3 months. That's exciting.

809
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:10,080
Um oh, paper towel right here. I'll just

810
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:11,919
give this a wipe because uh it did get a

811
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:16,720
little contaminated from the dirt and I

812
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:16,720
just want to rather keep that nice and

813
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:22,558
clean. So yeah, another new a new

814
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:24,559
product from Remo. I I kind of excited.

815
00:32:22,558 --> 00:32:27,200
I know John's used it once already. I

816
00:32:24,558 --> 00:32:30,639
haven't, but uh it's always nice to

817
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:32,480
support our buddies. Remo grows dank.

818
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:34,480
So, it's not completely out of this

819
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:38,319
world for me to think that he would be

820
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:41,079
able to um design a product that

821
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:44,558
properly cloned

822
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:47,278
plants. So, we've just taken about 10

823
00:32:44,558 --> 00:32:49,678
nice watermelon uh cuts, small ones to

824
00:32:47,278 --> 00:32:51,519
big ones. Uh the biggest ones really

825
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:53,200
only having a few growth sites and the

826
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:54,960
smaller ones just being uh you know,

827
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:57,600
also one or two growth sites, but a

828
00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:00,240
little bit shorter in stature.

829
00:32:57,599 --> 00:33:02,558
Looks great.

830
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:05,440
There we go. Some room. Perfect. So, we

831
00:33:02,558 --> 00:33:10,798
got one, two, three, four. It's hard to

832
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:13,960
see, too. You like 1 2 3 4 5 6 2 4 6 7.

833
00:33:10,798 --> 00:33:17,519
I need one more. I need an

834
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:19,840
eight. And why I like the eight is like

835
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:22,079
I said before is Here you go. is being

836
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:23,599
is little dip. Now, with me, I'm going

837
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:26,158
to just shave the side of this one and

838
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:28,798
do everybody's got little techniques.

839
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:30,480
Oh, water first dip. But I did do the

840
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:32,398
scissor dip. So, you know what? There's

841
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:35,120
just all these new techniques. Well, I

842
00:33:32,398 --> 00:33:37,759
love the idea of the gel sealing the the

843
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:39,599
cut. I love it. You know, I I you know

844
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:42,798
what? Doing this for years, growing my

845
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:44,240
own medicine, and every time you bring

846
00:33:42,798 --> 00:33:46,319
someone new and you go, "Hey, that's a

847
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,960
cool idea. I like that. I'll be doing

848
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:50,639
that from now on." I did have dirty

849
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,960
scissors and they were That's okay.

850
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:57,038
They're dirty with hash. So, at least

851
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:59,759
John's dirt is pure resin.

852
00:33:57,038 --> 00:34:01,278
So, shall we dome these up? Let's take

853
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:04,158
these outside. We're gonna take these

854
00:34:01,278 --> 00:34:09,000
outside. All right.

855
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:09,000
Of course, he's No way.

856
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:23,000
Potentially. Woohoo.

857
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,260
In we

858
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,519
go.

859
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:28,620
[Music]

860
00:34:26,519 --> 00:34:31,800
Yeah. All

861
00:34:28,619 --> 00:34:35,199
[Music]

862
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:37,039
right. You going to mark and label these

863
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:39,918
or Oh, they're already marked and

864
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:41,039
labeled. Oh, in what way? In what way?

865
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:44,719
I'm going to put them close to this

866
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:46,800
edge. Oh, cool. Ah, there's perfect. You

867
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:49,838
got your methods? I I have my methods.

868
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:51,200
I'm very a big strict guy on marking my

869
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:53,918
labels and stuff. Although the

870
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:56,078
watermelon is so unique that you'd never

871
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:58,480
mistake it for anything once it bloomed.

872
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:59,519
There we go.

873
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:04,480
So, what do you have in there again? You

874
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:06,000
got Tahoe and Medi and and Medi and um

875
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,000
that would be these little guys. That's

876
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,159
the hos. Oh, the hos. I like the hos. I

877
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,400
love the hos. It's great. Always got to

878
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:13,399
do the hos.

879
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:19,440
Under the dome.

880
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:22,960
Do you spray water in your dome? Um, I

881
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:25,679
do on the third day. Nice. I've always

882
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:28,320
been of on that as well. Okay, we're

883
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:31,519
good. I'm going to put these little

884
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:33,359
ladies down here at the end.

885
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:34,800
That's the Tahoe and she's rooted. Look

886
00:35:33,358 --> 00:35:36,480
at that. Sticking straight out just

887
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,640
today. Where'd you get that from? Um,

888
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:42,000
this actually came from This is a DNA

889
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:44,639
strain, guys. Yeah. But it came It came

890
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,599
from Manitoba from uh a friend named

891
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:51,199
Jason. Oh, nice. How many Taho you got?

892
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:53,519
one. Oh, you better that out. We'll be

893
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:54,639
putting that into uh definitely dirt

894
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:56,880
like these other ones that have been

895
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:58,559
rooting around here. So, you can see as

896
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,079
I only cut certain strings and as they

897
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:01,519
root, I start putting them there. So,

898
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:03,880
we're going to put this dome back on.

899
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:06,159
Yeah. And how I have my thing already

900
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:08,800
numbered, I kind of know that these

901
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:10,239
first three rows and those rows. So, as

902
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,880
you can see, I've done this quite a bit.

903
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:14,719
So, how do I know? Cuz right there,

904
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:17,358
fours and I got the threes done. So, I

905
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:21,519
already know on the Pakistani

906
00:36:17,358 --> 00:36:24,519
But now today it just became water

907
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:24,519
water.

908
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:30,160
Water netty.

909
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:32,000
And I already know what these are. This

910
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:33,199
very easy for me to see and I I just

911
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,199
don't really like to put too much on

912
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:36,799
there. So that kind of works out. But

913
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:38,159
have you had a chance to see the

914
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,680
watermelon? Let's go take a look. And

915
00:36:38,159 --> 00:36:41,199
what I normally do cuz we got blue light

916
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:43,919
now. I'm going to going to turn a couple

917
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:46,078
of these off so we can actually see in

918
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:48,559
there right now.

919
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:50,160
All right. It's the best way. Well, this

920
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:52,480
is my garden. You guys have seen it. And

921
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:55,159
uh now you're coming in. We're coming

922
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:58,240
in. Coming

923
00:36:55,159 --> 00:36:59,519
in. Awesome, brother. So, what I got to

924
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:02,519
do right now is I'm just going to shut

925
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:05,519
down a little bit of noise for

926
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:05,519
us. All

927
00:37:11,239 --> 00:37:15,598
right. That would be the medi there, my

928
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:20,280
friend. But you can see the watermelon

929
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:20,280
in the corner. There's four over there.

930
00:37:20,559 --> 00:37:24,199
Cool. Just showing them the first plant

931
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:28,078
I saw. That's awesome. That's the medic

932
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:28,078
kush. That's definitely my

933
00:37:32,519 --> 00:37:39,039
medicine. How she look reinous. I like

934
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,039
hearing those

935
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:46,159
things. She looks very resonous. John.

936
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:48,640
So you can see we got seven different

937
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:51,358
strains in here.

938
00:37:48,639 --> 00:37:53,118
Yes. So you've got many kush, right? And

939
00:37:51,358 --> 00:37:55,199
are these many kushes as well? No, that

940
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:57,358
there would be the that's the Dennis

941
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:59,919
Hoffer that were love the look on this

942
00:37:57,358 --> 00:38:01,519
little guy. Nice indica. Beautiful

943
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:04,880
plant. You can see I got four underneath

944
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:06,800
this Afghany style, man. Holy smokes.

945
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:09,440
That's definitely And then over here, uh

946
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:12,800
that there is the My Little Pony. And

947
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:14,320
you can see my little types that I have.

948
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,400
Like the one in the back there is more

949
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:19,200
of the solid. This one here, right

950
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,720
there. See that? Yeah.

951
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:22,078
And the three little sisters I talked

952
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:23,759
about, well, that's fresh frozen in the

953
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:26,720
freezer right now. And right beside you,

954
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,720
the watermelon looking

955
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:34,960
bag. Got you in my garden here. And I

956
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:37,039
want to give you a quick look at how I

957
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:39,199
got four plants per light. And I run

958
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:41,679
four different strains. I got my MKU. I

959
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:44,960
got my Dennis Hopper. I got my Bubba

960
00:38:41,679 --> 00:38:47,039
Chem. I got my My Little Pony. I got my

961
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,639
My Little Pony. I I got all my different

962
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:50,639
strains in here, which is quite nice.

963
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:51,920
This is my number two. You can see all

964
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:53,199
the different phenotypes and

965
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,720
everything's just going to sleep right

966
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:57,118
now because it's time for the lights to

967
00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:58,799
go off. Yeah. So, you can just see it's

968
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:00,880
uh you know how I got everything set up.

969
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,720
And that was my uh I had a leak in the

970
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:06,320
roof, so I had to cut down the blue skin

971
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:09,919
and fix that. But otherwise than that um

972
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:11,760
yeah this is my uh sealed research room

973
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,760
you know gives you an idea where you get

974
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:16,160
it done everything's um you know

975
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:19,599
designed for my perfection. The best

976
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:21,199
part about it this stool because now you

977
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:23,280
can see how I work. Everybody always

978
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:25,199
says I should film my room but I mean

979
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,640
for me being injured I can work on my

980
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:28,719
plants at this height and that's why you

981
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:30,239
always see this height in my room cuz I

982
00:39:28,719 --> 00:39:31,358
can work in this room. I can pick it up

983
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:32,959
and take a good look and it's

984
00:39:31,358 --> 00:39:34,719
comfortable for me. So it's perfect.

985
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:37,440
This is exactly how I do my medicine.

986
00:39:34,719 --> 00:39:40,719
And this is uh what I love so much. I

987
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:43,599
can uh this is trust on here. Here's my

988
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:45,598
corner. Up I go. And uh out we go. Say

989
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:48,240
good night to that room. There you go.

990
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:50,400
Very cool. And uh that's what she just

991
00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:54,519
did. She said good night. Good night.

992
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,519
Good night. Good night, ladies.

993
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:16,829
[Applause]

994
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:36,639
Wow. He's staring at the They're both

995
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:38,559
staring at the door. They're not running

996
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:39,639
for it. Here he comes. I had to bring

997
00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:43,039
him in from the

998
00:40:39,639 --> 00:40:45,679
outside. Up she comes. Awesome, bro.

999
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:47,519
Yeah. So, these just came from outside.

1000
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:50,480
And uh you know, normally John would

1001
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:52,960
never have these in his house, but

1002
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:56,559
because he has right now permission from

1003
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:59,119
Health Canada to to ship these off,

1004
00:40:56,559 --> 00:41:01,279
obviously, it's okay if we put them in

1005
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:02,880
here for 5 minutes and get ready. You

1006
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:04,880
and and it is it's a lot easier to

1007
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:07,680
actually do this inside because as you

1008
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:10,000
can see in in how everything's set up,

1009
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:11,838
um it's it's very hard. So So this is

1010
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,199
this is their this is their new home for

1011
00:41:11,838 --> 00:41:15,920
a little bit. This is going to be the

1012
00:41:13,199 --> 00:41:17,358
new home. Excellent. Excellent. Here.

1013
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,599
You know what? Here's the new home.

1014
00:41:17,358 --> 00:41:22,400
Check this out, guys. All right. You

1015
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:24,240
ready? This is the new home. I'm going

1016
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,559
to go in first, actually, cuz I'm going

1017
00:41:24,239 --> 00:41:28,000
to wrap the top so the dirt doesn't

1018
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:29,119
spread out if anything happens, I would

1019
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,519
think. Oh, that's a good idea. Yeah.

1020
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:31,519
Just give it a

1021
00:41:31,559 --> 00:41:36,639
little Just want to ensure a few things

1022
00:41:33,838 --> 00:41:39,078
here. So, I'm going to wrap the top of

1023
00:41:36,639 --> 00:41:42,960
my plant just like

1024
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:45,119
this. I got it for you.

1025
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:48,240
Thank you. Thank you, sir.

1026
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:51,870
Looks like it's a twoman team here.

1027
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:55,039
Yeah. Shrimp wrapping the cannabis

1028
00:41:51,869 --> 00:41:55,039
[Music]

1029
00:41:57,079 --> 00:42:01,039
plant. Might as well go professional.

1030
00:41:59,358 --> 00:42:03,920
Let that last one get right over top

1031
00:42:01,039 --> 00:42:08,039
there. And I'm just kind of the whole

1032
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:10,639
idea here. Beautiful. Just want to

1033
00:42:08,039 --> 00:42:12,079
ensure we're going to tape this up. And

1034
00:42:10,639 --> 00:42:13,960
we're going to do a really good job here

1035
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:17,280
for each one. idiot

1036
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:17,280
idea. So,

1037
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:21,599
uh, large saran

1038
00:42:22,358 --> 00:42:26,598
wrap. Oh, these are smelling so

1039
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:28,800
beautiful,

1040
00:42:26,599 --> 00:42:31,519
too. It's nice cuz normally they're

1041
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:33,039
they're outside and the smell in here is

1042
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:35,039
quite phenomenal when it comes to a

1043
00:42:33,039 --> 00:42:36,559
live. Yeah, it's nice for sure. Oh,

1044
00:42:35,039 --> 00:42:38,239
pushing that stock over quite a bit.

1045
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:40,239
There we go. There we go. So, now we're

1046
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:42,799
going to do this. And now, check this

1047
00:42:40,239 --> 00:42:44,479
out, guys. Quick wrap around the bottom.

1048
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,720
Drop this in this tube. And how we're

1049
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:50,480
going to

1050
00:42:45,719 --> 00:42:52,639
transplant. Transport. Not transplant.

1051
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:55,039
You got to go in at an angle there. Get

1052
00:42:52,639 --> 00:43:00,598
a bit of an angle here. How I'm going to

1053
00:42:55,039 --> 00:43:05,440
do this. Right down to the bottom. And

1054
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:08,640
uh there it is. In she goes. Booyah. And

1055
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:10,159
then Nice, nice, nice. Then we cap her.

1056
00:43:08,639 --> 00:43:12,000
And we're going to cap her out. We're

1057
00:43:10,159 --> 00:43:13,838
going to cap her out. Oh, it's going to

1058
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,119
be beautiful. Just like that. Might be

1059
00:43:13,838 --> 00:43:17,119
very much what you want to do with the

1060
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:19,200
bottom as well. I'm going to do the same

1061
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:20,880
thing. Cap the bottoms as well. Cap the

1062
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:22,399
bottom the same way. Upside down like

1063
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:24,240
that. And then we can wrap them very

1064
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,680
nicely. We'll only push up a tiny bit.

1065
00:43:24,239 --> 00:43:27,598
Yeah, that's great. Now that we've

1066
00:43:25,679 --> 00:43:29,039
capped the top, we can actually we're

1067
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:31,760
going to use a machine and we're going

1068
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:33,759
to wrap the tops of all of these. Yeah.

1069
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:36,319
Over at uh it'll be on a clear thing

1070
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:38,319
over at at work. We have access to a

1071
00:43:36,318 --> 00:43:40,318
machine. Okay. Um so I can have it

1072
00:43:38,318 --> 00:43:42,800
wrapped. would be very nice. But uh

1073
00:43:40,318 --> 00:43:44,880
yeah, this is how we're going to be

1074
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,160
transporting to our new licensed

1075
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,680
facility. All right. Well, let me help

1076
00:43:46,159 --> 00:43:49,118
you out. I'll get this camera on a

1077
00:43:47,679 --> 00:43:51,838
tripod and we'll get these last four

1078
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:53,358
plants done. Awesome. So, new method.

1079
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:54,799
Yeah. Well, that was me holding the

1080
00:43:53,358 --> 00:43:56,920
camera and watching John. Now, we're

1081
00:43:54,800 --> 00:44:01,119
going to help John out a little

1082
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:02,789
bit hand. So, we want to kind of talk

1083
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:03,960
with this really

1084
00:44:02,789 --> 00:44:08,400
[Music]

1085
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:10,880
nice around. Nice and gentle.

1086
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:12,240
Then we're able to start. And what we're

1087
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:16,000
looking at, we just want to have the

1088
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:20,078
top. Yeah. Not letting the dirt fly all

1089
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:22,039
over the plant while it's inside the uh

1090
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:25,760
while the

1091
00:44:22,039 --> 00:44:27,318
tonics. Yeah, that was much easier to do

1092
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:29,920
with your hand

1093
00:44:27,318 --> 00:44:32,480
here, going all across the top. Yeah,

1094
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:34,559
you s pretty nicely. How's that looking

1095
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:36,639
there? It looks real good. That's pretty

1096
00:44:34,559 --> 00:44:39,039
good. Perfect. That last one when you

1097
00:44:36,639 --> 00:44:40,799
dropped it accidentally was basically

1098
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:44,960
perfect. Perfect. So, I'm going to use

1099
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:44,960
the scissors here. Yeah. Cut them

1100
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:52,239
up. Perfect. Perfect. Now, watch. This

1101
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:53,719
is even better. So, what we're doing now

1102
00:44:52,239 --> 00:44:57,000
is we're going to stick this in like

1103
00:44:53,719 --> 00:45:00,239
this and pop this in. There's your

1104
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:01,679
bottom. And I guess some of these a

1105
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:04,639
little tighter than the other ones. No,

1106
00:45:01,679 --> 00:45:06,199
you got it. Very good. Very good. Look

1107
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:08,960
at this, guys. He's crushing it.

1108
00:45:06,199 --> 00:45:10,480
Literally. Literally crushing it. Well,

1109
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:12,240
you're going to get crushed. It's going

1110
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:14,639
to happen.

1111
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:17,199
You got it. Now, check this out. All

1112
00:45:14,639 --> 00:45:19,838
right. Nice and gentle. Nice and gentle.

1113
00:45:17,199 --> 00:45:22,879
Put it on a nice angle. And down. She

1114
00:45:19,838 --> 00:45:25,759
slides down. Look at that. Up we go. Up

1115
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:26,960
we go. Another base here. We're not

1116
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:29,200
going to be quite as violent with this

1117
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:31,519
one. We're going to have to gently fold

1118
00:45:29,199 --> 00:45:33,519
this top over cuz it's just right in the

1119
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:35,639
way. Okay. I think if we fold it gently,

1120
00:45:33,519 --> 00:45:38,358
we'll be less likely to crush

1121
00:45:35,639 --> 00:45:40,920
it. Nice and

1122
00:45:38,358 --> 00:45:43,199
gentle. Oh,

1123
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:45,639
yeah. That's good. Well, we're

1124
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:49,118
definitely getting our

1125
00:45:45,639 --> 00:45:51,598
airtight. Good stuff. So, I mean, that's

1126
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:53,119
pretty good. Yeah. Nice. Slide slide

1127
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:56,960
this one back over here with the other.

1128
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:56,960
There we go. All

1129
00:45:57,639 --> 00:46:05,349
right. All righty. There we go.

1130
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:05,349
[Music]

1131
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:10,160
Just a second. Let's just get this some

1132
00:46:08,159 --> 00:46:12,159
of this bottom stuff just a little

1133
00:46:10,159 --> 00:46:15,118
deadly right there. Thank you. There we

1134
00:46:12,159 --> 00:46:17,519
go. And this one. We're professionals.

1135
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:17,519
There we

1136
00:46:22,599 --> 00:46:27,200
go.

1137
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:30,200
Yep. Just that first little initial

1138
00:46:27,199 --> 00:46:30,199
stick.

1139
00:46:31,519 --> 00:46:35,318
There we go. Over to you. Now you got

1140
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:38,358
the

1141
00:46:35,318 --> 00:46:41,679
plants. Time to seal this top up real

1142
00:46:38,358 --> 00:46:42,679
nice. This is looking great. We've done

1143
00:46:41,679 --> 00:46:46,559
this

1144
00:46:42,679 --> 00:46:49,199
before. About 10 seconds. Yes. We've

1145
00:46:46,559 --> 00:46:53,679
been doing this for minutes now, John.

1146
00:46:49,199 --> 00:46:55,879
Been cut it. Ah, best thing about that

1147
00:46:53,679 --> 00:46:58,960
just play

1148
00:46:55,880 --> 00:47:00,838
nicely. Counting it top and bottom.

1149
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:04,079
Yes, you cap that

1150
00:47:00,838 --> 00:47:05,599
up. We'll get this many cush ready. Oh,

1151
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:06,880
this one fits a lot better. I guess some

1152
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:09,039
of these tubes are just fitting a little

1153
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:09,039
bit

1154
00:47:12,358 --> 00:47:17,920
differently. Boom. Boom. You want to

1155
00:47:15,039 --> 00:47:20,079
fold that head down again cuz it looks

1156
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:22,400
like it's going to need a bit of head.

1157
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:24,480
Push that down. That one just fits

1158
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:26,079
nicely on there, eh? Yeah, it's much

1159
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:27,920
nicer than that last one we had. We just

1160
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:30,640
had one tight one there, which is Well,

1161
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:34,159
you know, they are just two, so nobody's

1162
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:34,159
perfect. So, we've got three

1163
00:47:35,159 --> 00:47:40,960
done. Oh, look at that. There we go. I

1164
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:42,960
mean, there we go. I think we switched

1165
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:44,559
sides now. We're doing, you know, John

1166
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:48,720
and I like to mix it up. We got to mix

1167
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:48,719
it up. You like to mix it up. Let me

1168
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:52,159
get I think I'm going to do this one.

1169
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:54,000
I'm going to hold it on this side.

1170
00:47:52,159 --> 00:47:56,399
Perfect.

1171
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:59,838
And this way I'm passing it over to you

1172
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:01,200
like I did last time where it wasn't

1173
00:47:59,838 --> 00:48:05,559
sticking. Once this stuff sticks to

1174
00:48:01,199 --> 00:48:08,039
itself, it's a done deal. It's a done

1175
00:48:05,559 --> 00:48:10,119
deal. Good triangle to go

1176
00:48:08,039 --> 00:48:13,039
over right

1177
00:48:10,119 --> 00:48:14,720
there. Perfect. Are we perfect? Yeah.

1178
00:48:13,039 --> 00:48:17,559
That's real good. There we go. We just

1179
00:48:14,719 --> 00:48:20,318
tear off like that. Real

1180
00:48:17,559 --> 00:48:22,318
good. I think we're professionals. Oh,

1181
00:48:20,318 --> 00:48:25,119
you want the base?

1182
00:48:22,318 --> 00:48:26,480
Got your two. One and two. There we go.

1183
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:28,000
One for the bottom. One for the top.

1184
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:29,358
Looks like that one there's a crack.

1185
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,920
Yeah, that one has does have a crack,

1186
00:48:29,358 --> 00:48:34,799
but maybe it'll be the top. We could

1187
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:34,800
duct tape it as

1188
00:48:34,838 --> 00:48:38,400
well. I think it's the funny angle

1189
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:40,000
sometimes if you don't go in at the

1190
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:42,519
perfect angle. Like this one got pushed

1191
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:46,000
down so low that it makes it a lot

1192
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:46,000
harder. That's pretty

1193
00:48:46,519 --> 00:48:50,239
good. You don't want to push too hard.

1194
00:48:48,719 --> 00:48:51,919
Yeah, I'm kind of You're kind of like

1195
00:48:50,239 --> 00:48:54,078
going a little overboard. I'm kind of

1196
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:57,440
hurting myself now. Yeah. Let's just

1197
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:59,920
give it a kind of a good Here we go.

1198
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:03,358
Nice job. Yeah. Well, what's more even

1199
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:05,200
than the floor? Oh, man.

1200
00:49:03,358 --> 00:49:07,519
Oh, this is That's the lippy one. It's

1201
00:49:05,199 --> 00:49:09,519
just a little tight.

1202
00:49:07,519 --> 00:49:11,119
Down she goes. So, she's floating. So

1203
00:49:09,519 --> 00:49:13,199
nice when she slides in. I think this

1204
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:15,000
cracked one might come in handy here. Or

1205
00:49:13,199 --> 00:49:17,879
we're going to have to do

1206
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:20,318
this and have that one sealed up like

1207
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:22,920
that. We can deal with it later if we

1208
00:49:20,318 --> 00:49:27,199
want. There we go.

1209
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:29,200
Um, we have only one more of these. So,

1210
00:49:27,199 --> 00:49:30,879
we happen to have one more downstairs.

1211
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:32,239
So, we'll get that at the end. But for

1212
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:34,079
now, we're going to wrap this last one

1213
00:49:32,239 --> 00:49:36,399
up. I'm working up a bit of a sweat

1214
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:40,280
because for me, this is actually uh

1215
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:40,280
Well, it's a lot of work.

1216
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:44,400
So, scoop that up a little bit here.

1217
00:49:42,639 --> 00:49:46,078
Last one. And we're medicating cuz Cory,

1218
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:47,838
do I need to medicate? Hey, what? Whoa.

1219
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:49,920
I thought I got my trippy on me. It's

1220
00:49:47,838 --> 00:49:53,920
going to be soon.

1221
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:56,240
We got to go soon. Yes. Turns. Perfect.

1222
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:59,440
You don't even have to move. I can just

1223
00:49:56,239 --> 00:49:59,439
move this. All

Beautiful. All right. Now you want to

cutting right across. Yeah. Again.

1229
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:25,160
All the way across.

1230
00:50:21,719 --> 00:50:28,399
Perfect. Two more of

1231
00:50:25,159 --> 00:50:28,399
those. One

1232
00:50:29,318 --> 00:50:34,159
more.

1233
00:50:31,079 --> 00:50:34,160
Perfect. All

[Music]

1238
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:59,838
up. In we go. Oh, this one's huge

1239
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:02,000
compared to the last one. I know. That's

1240
00:50:59,838 --> 00:51:03,480
what I mean. This one here, this one's

1241
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:06,280
And we'll put the last top on from

1242
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:09,079
downstairs. Oh, I guess this one even.

1243
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:11,839
Perfect. I know, brother. All right.

1244

Excellente. So, so this is done. We're

00:52:15,679 --> 00:52:21,118
his nickname that I gave him that he

1274
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:22,400
likes. He loves that. Oh, and as I just

1275
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:24,400
I'm I'm waiting for you to hit that, but

1276
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:25,680
as you can see, I'm just going over top

1277
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:28,880
and see how this just melts. What is

1278
00:52:25,679 --> 00:52:31,598
that? The D420K. D420K. And that was

1279
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:32,760
made by D420K. And uh See, that's a

1280
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:36,000
great thing. And

1281
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:37,760
uh I think his is nice and hot. What are

1282
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:41,280
you hitting there? You know what? I'm

1283
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:43,040
going to hit to the 90 the 90 micron.

1284
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:45,119
That's just awesome cuz that's where I'd

1285
00:52:43,039 --> 00:52:48,558
be going right now. Yeah, I wish you

1286
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:50,240
could. That will be. All right. So,

1287
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:52,480
thanks, bro. Anytime you're ready, I'm

1288
00:52:50,239 --> 00:52:54,879
ready. I'm hitting. Peace, everybody.

1289
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,880
Puff

1290
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:08,880
Wednesday. Yeah.

1291
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:14,160
just epic.

1292
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,838
I love I love DK's. Talk about some

1293
00:53:14,159 --> 00:53:17,679
different pipes that we just hit. Like

1294
00:53:15,838 --> 00:53:20,000
let's talk about that for a second. Like

1295
00:53:17,679 --> 00:53:23,919
could we have hit

1296
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:25,960
more polar opposite pipes right now?

1297
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:28,400
Like

1298
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:30,400
honestly, you've got the treating

1299
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:32,480
yourself. What was this? A first prize

1300
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:34,960
winner. First prize winner. First prize

1301
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:36,240
winner for many kush. Mini kush for many

1302
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:38,079
kush. This was a couple years ago at the

1303
00:53:36,239 --> 00:53:41,039
treating yourself. He's got this classic

1304
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:44,079
ruler with the full crown. He's got the

1305
00:53:41,039 --> 00:53:48,239
14 uh mm, which is also the smaller

1306
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:51,200
little sister. And even cooler, he's got

1307
00:53:48,239 --> 00:53:54,838
the original bent bowl. I'll show you

1308
00:53:51,199 --> 00:53:58,639
guys this. Okay, this was a bowl that

1309
00:53:54,838 --> 00:54:01,920
myself, Tricom Farmer. There it is. So,

1310
00:53:58,639 --> 00:54:03,679
that's the original bent bowl. Um, not a

1311
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:05,838
very good design. Uh, now that I look

1312
00:54:03,679 --> 00:54:07,279
back upon it, it's a little bit too open

1313
00:54:05,838 --> 00:54:09,519
here, but this was one of the better

1314
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:12,319
ones. The 188s were the first ones we

1315
00:54:09,519 --> 00:54:16,400
did. Now, we came up with this design at

1316
00:54:12,318 --> 00:54:18,119
my booth at the Cana trade in burn,

1317
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:21,119
Switzerland in like

1318
00:54:18,119 --> 00:54:23,440
2002. And I remember Tricom Farmers with

1319
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:28,318
was with me and Mark McCoy from VIPAC

1320
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:30,559
and uh Ashan Shaheen from Vapier and uh

1321
00:54:28,318 --> 00:54:32,318
yeah we came up with this idea and it

1322
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:34,960
wasn't very many years later that Adam

1323
00:54:32,318 --> 00:54:37,279
Dunn from Hampleum and THC seeds he was

1324
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:39,440
like why don't you just bend the stem

1325
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:41,440
which really was a game changer it made

1326
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:43,679
so much more sense than bending the bowl

1327
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:46,480
cuz if you bend the stem you suddenly

1328
00:54:43,679 --> 00:54:48,159
make every angled bowl a flat bowl for

1329
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:49,838
which is why we want that bowl that's a

1330
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:52,078
bubble bowl. Yeah, that's for watching

1331
00:54:49,838 --> 00:54:53,759
hash melt. The the original bowl that

1332
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:56,079
comes with this bong is just a straight

1333
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:57,760
bowl and it's purely for for herb. It's

1334
00:54:56,079 --> 00:54:59,920
downstairs in my display case. I don't

1335
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:01,839
ever use it because I never I've never

1336
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:04,000
smoked I've never smoked herb actually.

1337
00:55:01,838 --> 00:55:06,159
No, I did when I won my cup. I stuffed

1338
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,880
it full. I wonder what is this now? Oh.

1339
00:55:06,159 --> 00:55:11,838
Oh, that would be the the bottom would

1340
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:14,880
be the 45 watermelon of watermelon. It

1341
00:55:11,838 --> 00:55:16,960
smells unbelievable. I know. And and the

1342
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:19,280
smell between say the 45 and smell the

1343
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:22,318
73 like I always talk about. It's

1344
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:25,040
different. And Oh yeah, the 45 is more

1345
00:55:22,318 --> 00:55:27,358
oily. Yeah, it's got that oily funky Oh

1346
00:55:25,039 --> 00:55:29,519
wow. This is the 73. Oh no, this is the

1347
00:55:27,358 --> 00:55:30,880
73. That would be dry sift. Oh, I was

1348
00:55:29,519 --> 00:55:33,039
going to say I think the cush is

1349
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:35,440
completely different.

1350
00:55:33,039 --> 00:55:38,400
73. Oh my goodness. You got to hit that

1351
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:42,000
next. Jeez.

1352
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:44,160
Okay, that's like white. I know. You

1353
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:47,440
made it. That's your birthday hash. We

1354
00:55:44,159 --> 00:55:50,000
made it. We grew it. I brought the

1355
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:52,079
clones and you're taking them home. This

1356
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:54,079
is a cool full circle that John and I

1357
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:55,760
are constantly rocking. It is pretty

1358
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:58,880
cool. Remember back in the day that

1359
00:55:55,760 --> 00:56:00,640
helicopter might have made us nervous?

1360
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:02,798
Not anymore. We're on our way to the

1361
00:56:00,639 --> 00:56:03,920
airport. And here's a strange thing.

1362
00:56:02,798 --> 00:56:05,280
Remember back in the day where we

1363
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:07,440
wouldn't have been filming all of this

1364
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:10,960
before we did this? Not that we ever did

1365
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:13,039
this before without licenses.

1366
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:14,280
I talked to this about Jason there when

1367
00:56:13,039 --> 00:56:16,558
I was over at his

1368
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:18,319
house. He did a video and he had my

1369
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:20,240
tattoo in it. I made him tear down the

1370
00:56:18,318 --> 00:56:22,480
video on YouTube because my tattoo was

1371
00:56:20,239 --> 00:56:24,000
in the video cuz I did not want anybody

1372
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:25,519
to know what I was doing. But I was

1373
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,079
conducting research. There's a guy on

1374
00:56:25,519 --> 00:56:30,639
Global National News. Yes. Yes. Things

1375
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:33,359
have changed. Things have changed. We're

1376
00:56:30,639 --> 00:56:35,838
educating now. Uh people want to learn.

1377
00:56:33,358 --> 00:56:37,838
We want to know. I mean, for us, it's

1378
00:56:35,838 --> 00:56:39,759
just me in everyday life as an educating

1379
00:56:37,838 --> 00:56:41,920
one another and working in the trenches.

1380
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:44,720
I would say you more than than me in

1381
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:46,240
certain ways. Uh um stories go back.

1382
00:56:44,719 --> 00:56:47,759
It's amazing what you've accomplished

1383
00:56:46,239 --> 00:56:49,919
over the years in this industry and the

1384
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:52,720
people you've met. And it's uh you know,

1385
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:55,519
long strange trip. It has been for dad

1386
00:56:52,719 --> 00:56:58,719
once said,

1387
00:56:55,519 --> 00:56:59,759
"A long strange long stage trip." Yeah.

1388
00:56:58,719 --> 00:57:01,519
Well, you know, I'm going to keep

1389
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:03,760
dabbing here. Yeah. Well, you inspired

1390
00:57:01,519 --> 00:57:07,318
me to to say, "Hey, you got to hit that

1391
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:10,640
73. Watch it melt off the the stem. The

1392
00:57:07,318 --> 00:57:10,639
skeletal just

1393
00:57:13,159 --> 00:57:17,318
drips. Nice bubble. Of course, those

1394
00:57:16,239 --> 00:57:20,879
clear

1395
00:57:17,318 --> 00:57:23,279
domes. It's now my turn to hit this. Uh

1396
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:25,838
I'm I'm going to Well, that's the That's

1397
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:25,839
the sweet

1398
00:57:26,679 --> 00:57:30,159
skunk. And me knowing I just took a

1399
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:31,519
little too much, I'm going to put some

1400
00:57:30,159 --> 00:57:36,358
back. I think I'm going to bring the

1401
00:57:31,519 --> 00:57:39,400
hitman to Jamaica. Are you?

1402
00:57:36,358 --> 00:57:43,078
Yeah. This and the D

1403
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:46,798
nail is very important. We need the D

1404
00:57:43,079 --> 00:57:49,200
nail. We cannot be without the D nail.

1405
00:57:46,798 --> 00:57:51,358
So Jamaica is still all up in the air,

1406
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:52,960
but I've got to make it happen. Scott's

1407
00:57:51,358 --> 00:57:56,798
been asking me for dates. Tony's been

1408
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:59,039
asking me for dates. John's wondering.

1409
00:57:56,798 --> 00:58:01,838
We need to we need to book these tickets

1410
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:03,039
like in the next day or two.

1411
00:58:01,838 --> 00:58:04,558
Yeah, we got to figure out the whole

1412
00:58:03,039 --> 00:58:07,039
game plan now. There's a lot going on

1413
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:08,960
here. And there is

1414
00:58:07,039 --> 00:58:11,039
you got your family vacation that you're

1415
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:14,240
going to be going into. So, I mean, the

1416
00:58:11,039 --> 00:58:18,318
sooner the better, right? So,

1417
00:58:14,239 --> 00:58:20,000
absolutely. Yeah. So, I guess we're

1418
00:58:18,318 --> 00:58:22,000
going to end up loading these plants up

1419
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:24,639
onto my truck and we're going to head

1420
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:27,280
down to um the place where we're going

1421
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:29,358
to be wrapping them on the pallet. And

1422
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:30,798
from there, I guess we're going to just

1423
00:58:29,358 --> 00:58:32,239
take our time, make our way to the

1424
00:58:30,798 --> 00:58:34,000
airport, and we're going to hit Megaill

1425
00:58:32,239 --> 00:58:34,879
after we drop these bad boys off. Yeah,

1426
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,880
because then we're going to have

1427
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:38,079
definitely an appetite. Yeah, by then

1428
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:39,119
we'll have an appetite. I'm still pretty

1429
00:58:38,079 --> 00:58:41,359
full from breakfast. Yeah, it was

1430
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:43,838
actually a really nice breakfast. Well,

1431
00:58:41,358 --> 00:58:46,960
more rips and uh Puff Wednesday, we'll

1432
00:58:43,838 --> 00:58:48,318
be back. So, uh yeah, this was the way

1433
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:50,159
we managed to get these into these

1434
00:58:48,318 --> 00:58:52,079
trays. They're laying nicely. Uh we had

1435
00:58:50,159 --> 00:58:54,318
them standing up. It wasn't really safe.

1436
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:56,880
So, now we're going to tape the lids

1437
00:58:54,318 --> 00:58:59,838
onto each tube. Securing that lid, John.

1438
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:03,240
Secure your lid. All right. So, getting

1439
00:58:59,838 --> 00:59:06,318
the lid secured. We already got the base

1440
00:59:03,239 --> 00:59:08,719
secured. Simple taping. And this is just

1441
00:59:06,318 --> 00:59:11,880
getting these ready for the job that is

1442

01:01:34,159 --> 01:01:37,558
growers. John, did you know what types

1468
01:01:35,599 --> 01:01:40,318
there are? Um, those that require

1469
01:01:37,559 --> 01:01:43,040
forklifts and those that don't. I

1470
01:01:40,318 --> 01:01:46,318

Oh, you've got your papers. Yeah. I'm

1511
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:40,318
just going to, you know, nothing really

1512
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:41,838
to just this is where it's going and

1513
01:04:40,318 --> 01:04:43,119
everything should be on file and there's

1514
01:04:41,838 --> 01:04:44,960
the number and then everything's taken

1515
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:46,798
care of. Oh, perfect. Real quick, this

1516
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:49,199
should be a 5minut. Five minute.

1517
01:04:46,798 --> 01:04:49,199
Probably

1518
01:05:05,159 --> 01:05:10,358
10 offloaded yet? No.

1519
01:05:10,798 --> 01:05:14,159
So, do you have documents all of an

1520
01:05:12,559 --> 01:05:17,519
airway bill and everything or that's

1521
01:05:14,159 --> 01:05:19,038
what they send me? I had no idea yet.

1522
01:05:17,519 --> 01:05:22,079
Yeah. From the distance, you'd never

1523
01:05:19,039 --> 01:05:22,079
know what was in that

1524
01:05:22,838 --> 01:05:25,838
truck.

1525
01:05:29,239 --> 01:05:36,358
Strains. Here we go.

1526
01:05:32,719 --> 01:05:36,358
One, two, three.

1527
01:05:40,159 --> 01:05:44,879
Your documents, sir. My

1528
01:05:42,838 --> 01:05:47,519
stuff. So, they're just going to give

1529
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:50,760
that a quick weigh.

1530
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:50,759
What's that?

1531
01:05:51,039 --> 01:05:54,400
Basically, they give it away. They tell

1532
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:56,879
us the weight and then we go back with

1533
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:59,960
the weight. Oh, is that one? Yeah,

1534
01:05:56,880 --> 01:06:03,119
that's what he said to do.

1535
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:06,119
So, all right. There she goes on the

1536
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:06,119
forklift.

1537
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:15,519
So now she gets

1538
01:06:12,519 --> 01:06:17,000
measured for the exact space that she

1539
01:06:15,519 --> 01:06:19,679
takes up. Perfect

1540
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:21,440
little video for them to see once this

1541
01:06:19,679 --> 01:06:23,919
is all taken care of. Yeah, I know. It's

1542
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:26,798
a nice little um a little documentation

1543
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:28,720
and uh we showed ourselves uh packaging

1544
01:06:26,798 --> 01:06:31,119
everything up and they'll open

1545
01:06:28,719 --> 01:06:32,639
everything up the same way. So it'll be

1546
01:06:31,119 --> 01:06:34,079
great. It'll be exciting. And it's

1547
01:06:32,639 --> 01:06:35,679
sitting on the scale right now. So Oh,

1548
01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:37,839
I'm standing on it. Yeah, it's okay.

1549
01:06:35,679 --> 01:06:41,199
He's standing on it, too.

1550
01:06:37,838 --> 01:06:44,000
That's how they get the extra money.

1551
01:06:41,199 --> 01:06:46,078
Forget about the thumb. Kilos. 24 kilos.

1552
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:49,519
44 kilos. Yeah, considering I mean,
