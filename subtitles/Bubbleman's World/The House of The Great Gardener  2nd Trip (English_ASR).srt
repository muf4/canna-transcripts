00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:24,420
hey guys welcome to bubble man's world

3
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:26,219
damn nice early morning here on my way

4
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,618
to the great gardeners I'm just sitting

5
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:30,299
at the ferry terminal waiting for the

6
00:00:28,618 --> 00:00:32,579
ferry to come in was gonna have a little

7
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:35,429
puff and I realized I only brought my D

8
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:37,100
mail and it's kind of big and large I

9
00:00:35,429 --> 00:00:40,619
didn't bring a bowl for the mothership

10
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:43,609
so I guess what we're doing here is

11
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:45,988
we're gonna make the infamous apple pie

12
00:00:43,609 --> 00:00:47,399
always nice to have a screen with you I

13
00:00:45,988 --> 00:00:51,179
have quite a few of these in the car

14
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:56,730
when I roll so we're gonna be using will

15
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:58,320
use the pencil here broken in half is

16
00:00:56,729 --> 00:01:00,419
skin we're gonna stick that through the

17
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,280
Apple make it so there's a bowl on one

18
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:05,159
end and a little mouthpiece on the other

19
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:09,060
I'll gently work the skin away and fit

20
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:15,180
that in there and basically we'll have a

21
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:23,750
pipe so step one make some juice

22
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:27,590
yummy yummy all right so there we go

23
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:27,590
come right out the other end

24
00:01:28,228 --> 00:01:36,810
all right get that unstuck go through

25
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:36,810
the other end

26
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:44,180
[Music]

27
00:01:39,609 --> 00:01:46,609
to jam it through a couple of times so

28
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:48,400
we got ourselves a nice little hole and

29
00:01:46,609 --> 00:01:52,209
what I usually do for this part is I

30
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:52,210
usually fit the screen

31
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,909
and just with mine I usually use a nail

32
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,400
but I don't actually have a nail right

33
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:01,760
now so we use the the wipes tweezers

34
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:06,810
that she's got here in her car

35
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:11,090
we'll just gently poke through the skin

36
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,090
a nice round hole

37
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:22,080
this part is actually pretty key because

38
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:24,320
it really solidifies the screen it

39
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,690
really gets the screen stuck in there

40
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:33,209
and it gives you a nice little bite of

41
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:37,699
Apple too who doesn't like Apple all

42
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:37,700
right I'm gonna look something like that

43
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:44,500
and then wouldn't jam or screen in there

44
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:48,640
and our screens just gonna sit so flush

45
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:52,110
and so lovely and that nice so we got a

46
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:52,109
little mouthpiece on the other end I

47
00:02:53,009 --> 00:03:07,979
think it's time to have a bowl all right

48
00:02:57,479 --> 00:03:14,109
so felines lighters we got bubbles and

49
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:17,679
baubles all right let's see what we got

50
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:20,770
here happening open up a little oil

51
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:25,800
slick cuz we love those oil slicks real

52
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:29,320
nice way to keep keep the sift in place

53
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:34,450
so this particular sift is from flat 421

54
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:36,870
this is his MK ULTRA dry cept not sure

55
00:03:34,449 --> 00:03:40,319
if you can really see that kind of a

56
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:40,319
little bit dark

57
00:03:41,629 --> 00:03:48,379
there it is there we go until you see

58
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:50,150
beautiful quality I am I think I cleaned

59
00:03:48,379 --> 00:03:53,109
this actually I did so this is like a

60
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:53,110
99% err

61
00:03:54,810 --> 00:04:04,629
all right put that right in there little

62
00:04:00,969 --> 00:04:07,539
rip I'm just good to close the oil slick

63
00:04:04,629 --> 00:04:10,689
balls so it doesn't fall

64
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:17,819
I guess there's really nothing left to

65
00:04:10,689 --> 00:04:17,819
do but wake that bake all right

66
00:04:18,139 --> 00:04:21,158
papal reps

hey guys welcome back actually had to go

99
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:12,940
into the smoking area of the ferry here

100
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,470
it was just way too windy wasn't getting

101
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:16,650
the b-line lint and it seemed like a

102
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:20,750
silly experience

103
00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:20,750
much easier to like a beeline here

104
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:59,559
I love it I only have four pockets

105
00:11:55,870 --> 00:12:05,549
but I keep jamming the beeline liner

106
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:05,549
people losing them morning bacon wagons

107
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,710
a little rip

108
00:12:28,149 --> 00:12:32,220
trips in the apple pie

109
00:12:30,029 --> 00:12:35,079
do a couple around to the ferry keep a

110
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:36,519
bump into any friends

111
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:39,660
killer whales and dolphins on the

112
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:39,659
entrance into the Nile

113
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:43,600

upset it up where cuz you're sweating me

122
00:13:54,990 --> 00:14:00,279
to the paper like hours when I'm

123
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,519

127
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:19,740
at departure Bay in Nanaimo we've got

128
00:14:16,539 --> 00:14:22,629
about a 20 minute drive to Duncan

129
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:27,220
luckily I have someone who can drive for

130

me today so I'm allowed to medicate yes

131
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:30,250

132
00:14:28,899 --> 00:14:32,949
we're not actually allowed to medicate

133
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:34,990
and then drive a car or so if you're

134
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:36,610
going to do your medication make sure

135
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:40,700
that you have someone to drive your car

136

197
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,009
yes

198
00:19:56,119 --> 00:20:00,079
there we go that was a little bit

199
00:19:57,798 --> 00:20:01,849
lighter right the nineties lighter but

200
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:04,178
the proper color now it was kind of blue

201
00:20:01,849 --> 00:20:04,178
there

202
00:20:09,788 --> 00:20:15,710
right

203
00:20:12,058 --> 00:20:15,710
let's have a rip that Hank

204
00:20:23,509 --> 00:20:29,578
[Music]

205
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:57,298
haha I found thee what that meant before

206
00:20:36,329 --> 00:20:59,308
the next dawn good plan it's hard not to

207
00:20:57,298 --> 00:21:02,038
make snakes with hash when you got good

208
00:20:59,308 --> 00:21:04,460
huh come on get it in your fingers a

209
00:21:02,038 --> 00:21:04,460
little bit

210
00:21:07,529 --> 00:21:17,279
rolling up the hashish India styles and

211
00:21:14,069 --> 00:21:23,939
then we're gonna put it on the ceramic

212
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:24,960
dough a little ceramic dome that's

213
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,789
pretty good

214
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,210
let's see yeah I think so it looks

215
00:21:26,789 --> 00:21:29,210
proper

216
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:36,350
let's darn fine now let's see your STIs

217
00:21:38,779 --> 00:21:42,369
there was a burn on myself yeah you can

218
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:46,089
do it

219
00:21:42,369 --> 00:21:46,089
I've faith in you

220
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:58,570
see the tipsy burglar

221
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:12,808
[Music]

222
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:23,630
slow and steady wins the race

223
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:26,769
that was probably so tasty here tyr's

224
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:29,200
[Music]

225
00:22:26,769 --> 00:22:32,639
seven hundred and seventy degrees on the

226
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:37,590
quartz nail with the ceramic insert

227
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:37,590
equals C tasty

228
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:45,970
what are you saying about that just a

229
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:49,750
man super flavourful like almost like

230
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:52,720
geo cold just that's hard to compete

231
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:56,140
with that flavor I don't think that was

232
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:59,110
the 99 one either no no I think that was

233
00:22:56,140 --> 00:23:02,200
just what comes off the trimmer table

234
00:22:59,109 --> 00:23:04,449
which is still quite clean like probably

235
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:08,640
85 well clean that one and then we'll

236
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:08,640
compare it to a 99 all right sounds good

237
00:23:08,788 --> 00:23:15,460
all right so I'm gonna take a little rip

238
00:23:13,089 --> 00:23:17,199
while he's waiting for the ceramic to

239
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:19,298
pull down he wants to do the test on me

240
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:22,149
I think the first one was just his

241
00:23:19,298 --> 00:23:24,519
lightly bounced very gently seed

242
00:23:22,148 --> 00:23:26,139
collection type of thing over screens

243
00:23:24,519 --> 00:23:29,319
single screen and it he got some

244
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:32,520
incredible quality 85 percent heads I

245
00:23:29,319 --> 00:23:34,480
took that and cleaned it up to a 99% and

246
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:36,808
we're just going to show you the

247
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,808
difference

248
00:23:45,099 --> 00:23:48,269
chunk of pyrite

249
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:52,310
there ya go

250
00:23:54,819 --> 00:23:58,048
oh well that's good

251
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:07,820
well one thing about the great partners

252
00:24:02,388 --> 00:24:12,199
strains as they do not lack labor flavor

253
00:24:07,819 --> 00:24:14,538
they're so tasty dude yeah from the hey

254
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:16,788
homeland to the Afghani for the bar that

255
00:24:14,538 --> 00:24:20,569
sweets done I mean they're all just so

256
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:22,878
delicious flavor I'm free I couldn't

257
00:24:20,569 --> 00:24:25,398
tell you how many strains that is on a

258
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:28,128
lievable flavor we went through and then

259
00:24:25,398 --> 00:24:31,548
it's just the best of the box over the

260
00:24:28,128 --> 00:24:34,248
years over the thousands of members that

261
00:24:31,548 --> 00:24:37,519
have sampled the strains and told us yes

262
00:24:34,249 --> 00:24:39,528
that one works for us yes you know by

263
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:41,179
laughing and it's the super flavorful

264
00:24:39,528 --> 00:24:44,898
ones it's a lot here it's not

265
00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:49,879
necessarily the 20% THC I think no I

266
00:24:44,898 --> 00:24:51,558
think that number has really no no sort

267
00:24:49,878 --> 00:24:53,928
of like it has a small place that has a

268
00:24:51,558 --> 00:24:55,548
small place that has one indication I

269
00:24:53,929 --> 00:24:57,798
think it's been a bit of a deceiver

270
00:24:55,548 --> 00:25:00,288
just like now with people like oh I want

271
00:24:57,798 --> 00:25:02,210
to strain with just CBD or I want you

272
00:25:00,288 --> 00:25:03,919
know Bakley because we really don't

273
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:06,259
understand the full effects of the

274
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:09,740
cannabinoid profile and how it affects

275
00:25:06,259 --> 00:25:11,628
us you know it's one thing to say all it

276
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:13,429
had a certain percentage of something

277
00:25:11,628 --> 00:25:15,648
and then just the student it that's the

278
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:17,419
thing that was helping you yeah when

279
00:25:15,648 --> 00:25:19,908
really it could be that well but what

280
00:25:17,419 --> 00:25:22,038
about all these volatile oils that

281
00:25:19,909 --> 00:25:25,220
modulate and what about the different

282
00:25:22,038 --> 00:25:26,839
cannabinoids the terpenoids yeah but

283
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:29,690
you're not interpret ions into the mix

284
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:32,118
and that's exactly people are you

285
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:34,249
finding that now with turkeys for

286
00:25:32,118 --> 00:25:36,470
enterpreneurs from other plants you know

287
00:25:34,249 --> 00:25:38,480
the mersin for Mango is a popular one

288
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:38,980
yeah people being able to experiment on

289
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,710
their own

290
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:43,900
sort of try and modulate your effects

291
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:46,960
that you're getting from smoking by just

292
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:49,179
you know eating some amang

293
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,650
for you take a rib it's definitely

294
00:25:49,179 --> 00:25:54,610
something to be said for that somebody

295
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:57,309
said to that I think I think once we get

296
00:25:54,609 --> 00:25:59,829
the terpenoid profiles done we start

297
00:25:57,308 --> 00:26:01,869
understanding though the differences in

298
00:25:59,829 --> 00:26:06,849
there in ice and that someone comes in

299
00:26:01,869 --> 00:26:09,428
to a club and and they're looking for a

300
00:26:06,849 --> 00:26:11,349
specific Turkey hmm God says this I'm

301
00:26:09,429 --> 00:26:15,910
not looking for the CBE anymore I'm

302
00:26:11,349 --> 00:26:17,409
looking for the alpha toluene I'm

303
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:19,990
looking for something yeah maybe in a

304
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:22,058
combination of two like that's why

305
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:24,130
that's why I think we're worth the

306
00:26:22,058 --> 00:26:28,779
government's getting it wrong with not

307
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:32,200
allowing extract because this right here

308
00:26:28,779 --> 00:26:34,750
and this stuff right here is the

309
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:39,340
medicine hit absolutely right this here

310
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:41,650
this here that's legal has the medicine

311
00:26:39,339 --> 00:26:44,769
on it and it's the messenger and there's

312
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:46,540
a plant material but you don't need you

313
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:50,319
don't need the plant material what you

314
00:26:46,539 --> 00:26:52,029
mean is this what you need in kind of

315
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:53,918
thing like this is like apples being

316
00:26:52,029 --> 00:26:56,019
illegal but you can have apple trees

317
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:58,270
like you can go to citizen foods a

318
00:26:56,019 --> 00:27:00,519
dynamic will treat you no problem but if

319
00:26:58,269 --> 00:27:04,240
you take those apples off and like make

320
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:06,910
like an apple crisp you know it's like

321
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:09,789
it's like them telling you that you have

322
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:11,620
to eat the whole apple tree that's what

323
00:27:09,789 --> 00:27:13,178
I'm saying they don't want to about us

324
00:27:11,619 --> 00:27:14,769
use the Apple they don't want to I

325
00:27:13,179 --> 00:27:17,110
always you can't take the Apple off and

326
00:27:14,769 --> 00:27:18,668
even have to eat the whole tree yeah so

327
00:27:17,109 --> 00:27:22,418
this is the fight we're fighting here in

328
00:27:18,669 --> 00:27:24,400
Canada they have cannabis they don't

329
00:27:22,419 --> 00:27:25,920
really understand that what we want

330
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:28,470
about cannabis

331
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:30,630
the medicine so much like when you order

332
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:33,000
pizza you open the box and take the

333
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:35,790
pizza out imagine you were being told

334
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,380
that you had to also consume the box and

335
00:27:35,789 --> 00:27:40,170
then to take the pizza out of the box

336
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:44,430
would actually be a totally totally the

337
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:46,890
other analogy right now is the MMPR and

338
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:48,920
the MMP are saying that you have to buy

339
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:51,330
from a commercial establishment

340
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:53,730
essentially that's like saying you can

341
00:27:51,329 --> 00:27:55,679
no longer cook food at home right you

342
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:57,809
have to go to a restaurant and buy your

343
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:59,880
food for the rest of your life so pretty

344
00:27:57,809 --> 00:28:01,740
good analogy all right no more cooking

345
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:03,870
at home because why your use of power

346
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:06,240
using 220 power on your stove it's

347
00:28:03,869 --> 00:28:08,069
dangerous cause fire and fire hazard

348
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,599
fire hazards how many fires are caused

349
00:28:08,069 --> 00:28:11,759
by stoves

350
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:13,799
those are dangerous I think we should

351
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:15,569
ban them yeah and make everyone together

352
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:17,250
buddy make everybody go to a restaurant

353
00:28:15,569 --> 00:28:19,950
see how that works

354
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:20,759
yeah that seems people can't grow their

355
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:23,809
own medicine

356
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:27,269
come on it seems weak remaining tomato

357
00:28:23,809 --> 00:28:29,399
on my own I can make my own beer yeah I

358
00:28:27,269 --> 00:28:31,769
make my own wine and I'm not opposed to

359
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:33,630
them having tomatoes available for me if

360
00:28:31,769 --> 00:28:35,400
I don't want to grocery some grocery

361
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:37,440
store as a grocery store yeah you should

362
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:39,000
have that's important that hard scale I

363
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,309
have no problem with the large scale the

364
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:45,869
problem is they're taking the personal

365
00:28:41,309 --> 00:28:47,279
rights away yeah that's definitely well

366
00:28:45,869 --> 00:28:49,949
you know here we are we're almost in our

367
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:52,019
last month here back you know right

368
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:54,019
around the corner in the next day I

369
00:28:52,019 --> 00:28:56,730
guess we're gonna be in the March and

370
00:28:54,019 --> 00:28:58,289
once we're in the March that gives us 31

371
00:28:56,730 --> 00:29:00,630
days before we find out about our

372
00:28:58,289 --> 00:29:03,659
injunction when we find out whether

373
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:05,970
we're going to abide by the law and

374
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:08,360
destroy all of our cannabis mixing it

375
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:12,029
with kitty litter whether we're going to

376
00:29:08,359 --> 00:29:15,479
say no we can't abide by this law and

377
00:29:12,029 --> 00:29:17,910
continue to grow cannabis because many

378
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:20,009
are going to do that and then the other

379
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:21,600
option is that we win this injunction

380
00:29:20,009 --> 00:29:25,019
and that everything

381
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:27,058
as is the MMP are still come in it's not

382
00:29:25,019 --> 00:29:29,819
going to hurt their business for the

383
00:29:27,058 --> 00:29:31,859
little guy to be able to grow yeah you

384
00:29:29,819 --> 00:29:33,779
know and when I see yeah I hit but the

385
00:29:31,859 --> 00:29:36,149
injunction still is just the it's just a

386
00:29:33,779 --> 00:29:37,619
pic in the can down the road it is right

387
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:40,080
that is he kicks I can down the road all

388
00:29:37,619 --> 00:29:43,379
the way up to injunction and then John

389
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:45,298
wins well that's for Kirk wins there's a

390
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:48,419
lot so there's lots of fights out there

391
00:29:45,298 --> 00:29:51,179
there are that it's ridiculous there's

392
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:55,640
one guy out there that his daily limit

393
00:29:51,179 --> 00:29:58,200
is higher than a hundred and fifty grams

394
00:29:55,640 --> 00:30:00,990
so he's yeah he's not even allowed he is

395
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:04,200
not allowed to even order his daily

396
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:06,210
limit yeah so you can see they've got a

397
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:08,788
little a few little things that are that

398
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:10,829
are it's just a few little things if

399
00:30:08,788 --> 00:30:12,720
they change this thing could just be

400
00:30:10,829 --> 00:30:14,129
fine and no one would have a problem

401
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,650
with it we don't have a problem with

402
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:18,150
large production facilities and you know

403
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:19,980
what I mean and when I even say the

404
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:21,960
little guy like I'm even talking about

405
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:25,769
guys like Matt in the great gardener

406
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:28,259
like this is not a jar Joshua's grow

407
00:30:25,769 --> 00:30:29,700
this is this grows a good amount of

408
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:32,009
medicine for a decent amount of people

409
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:34,590
but by no means would it ever you know

410
00:30:32,009 --> 00:30:36,119
produce enough medicine for a portion of

411
00:30:34,589 --> 00:30:38,099
Canada's medical and what about what

412
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:40,168
nominal I think people look at this and

413
00:30:38,099 --> 00:30:44,250
they see your grow and they just think

414
00:30:40,169 --> 00:30:45,140
that's just so huge you know not you do

415
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:48,769
what you talked about

416
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:51,659
exactly right way if you talk about this

417
00:30:48,769 --> 00:30:53,730
it's not huge it's not it it's not a

418
00:30:51,659 --> 00:30:57,270
huge endeavor I think I mean it's like

419
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:58,798
you know like acres and acres should be

420
00:30:57,269 --> 00:31:03,179
under glass

421
00:30:58,798 --> 00:31:05,069
beam grown sections like I'm from the

422
00:31:03,179 --> 00:31:08,100
prairies so when you do things big in

423
00:31:05,069 --> 00:31:10,950
the prairies it's not acres and it's not

424
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:14,399
hectares its sections and the section is

425
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:15,190
basically like a mile by a mile which is

426
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,840
interesting

427
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:18,519
and it it's kilometres but I'm certainly

428
00:31:16,839 --> 00:31:21,399
eating our farmers follow sections that

429
00:31:18,519 --> 00:31:24,730
we still use a mile by a mile that's a

430
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:27,430
big section of of land to be growing

431
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:29,200
herd and so you wanted one

432
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:34,840
this little guy I'll get the camera

433
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:36,420
close for it no see what we got we got a

434
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:40,529
few things to do today we're going to

435
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:40,529
walk through the garden of course

436
00:32:11,109 --> 00:32:14,240

00:33:21,788 --> 00:33:30,569
is that no that was that would have been

445
00:33:24,398 --> 00:33:30,569
dry stuff that's what I thought

446
00:33:31,339 --> 00:33:34,029
was pressed

join us is in Spain for spannabis he's

471

not sure if he's gonna be able to make

472
00:35:20,019 --> 00:35:24,670
it happen but he's definitely gonna try

and gonna be there and we just raised

474
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:30,809
it's been yeah yeah but here's the else

475
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:33,490
- it's a great I've been for it's like

476
00:35:30,809 --> 00:35:36,369
it's naive I loved like Sunday the last

477
00:35:33,489 --> 00:35:40,439
day they go in and he could tell there's

478
00:35:36,369 --> 00:35:42,880
been a party right Flyers are everywhere

479
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:45,190
fifty thousand people outside the

480
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,610
building around like trim it's a nice

481
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:48,579
venue

482
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:50,920
even the entrance it's almost like the

483
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:54,159
entrance to the Louvre in Paris we've

484
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:55,780
got this big glass pyramid it's just

485
00:35:54,159 --> 00:35:57,579
sort of right at the entrance into the

486
00:35:55,780 --> 00:36:01,410
venue and yeah be good

487
00:35:57,579 --> 00:36:01,409
I don't hassle smoke away

488
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:06,099
and it's going to be 20 degrees maybe 20

489
00:36:04,659 --> 00:36:08,710
degrees so yeah I'm looking to go back

490
00:36:06,099 --> 00:36:12,369
to it I guess we're gonna pop a few more

491
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:15,820
bowls here and then Matt's gonna move

492
00:36:12,369 --> 00:36:18,700
out there come on the same you see the

493
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:21,579
state and that's why we always put the

494
00:36:18,699 --> 00:36:23,439
lids back on me except this one that's

495
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:25,990
something if it's that one this one here

496
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:29,619
and just on that I'd be on the ground

497
00:36:25,989 --> 00:36:32,588
crying right now but that's not us god

498
00:36:29,619 --> 00:36:34,690
is that great I would say so that almost

499
00:36:32,588 --> 00:36:36,929
has a cat piss smell to it like that is

500
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:36,929
dead

501
00:36:40,019 --> 00:36:44,130
very nice the fresh frozen there that

502
00:36:42,179 --> 00:36:47,309
planed up to almost perfection with just

503
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:49,050
that the slightest tiniest little pieces

504
00:36:47,309 --> 00:36:52,199
that are a little bit bigger and they

505
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:55,080
have this purple that s color compared

506
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:56,579
to everything else which is white it

507
00:36:55,079 --> 00:37:00,869
looks really nice of course it melts

508
00:36:56,579 --> 00:37:02,340
into an absolute and please liquid then

509
00:37:00,869 --> 00:37:04,680
we'll make sure we get you a macro shot

510
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:06,690
of this particular hash melting so you

511
00:37:04,679 --> 00:37:08,219
can see what we're talking about it's

512
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:12,539
really just liquefies and turns this

513
00:37:08,219 --> 00:37:15,209
golden color also yeah I'm gonna get 23

514
00:37:12,539 --> 00:37:19,710
more of those and we'll get into the

515
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:22,230
garden with Matt keep watching all right

516
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:26,929
we're gonna head upstairs to one of the

517
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:26,929
bloom rooms so Matt's already up there

518
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:30,890
light that looks better

519
00:37:30,949 --> 00:37:37,649
thank you thank you

520
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:39,889
nanak catatonic room well this looks

521
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:39,889
great

522
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:43,619
I'll have to shoot it with the macro

523
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:46,889
lens yeah yeah it would be great get

524
00:37:43,619 --> 00:37:50,309
some canna tonic this room was destined

525
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:55,139
for room number two but because the MMAR

526
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:58,650
is over at the end of March we had just

527
00:37:55,139 --> 00:38:01,219
decided to flour out the bedroom it's

528
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:01,220
really a

529
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:06,329
nice little trikes on there

530
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:11,690
so this is full can of tonic well

531
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:13,119
catatonic do as much can atomic as we

532
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:17,420
can

533
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:21,920
yeah I guess when you grow with the

534
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:24,250
patient's want people are gonna ask for

535
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,250
the catatonic

536
00:38:29,489 --> 00:38:33,079
we've got eight lights in here

537
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:41,640
eight lights the rooms only like just

538
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:43,170
over seven feet tall then you have

539
00:38:41,639 --> 00:38:46,819
everything lifted quite a bit almost

540
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:51,119
three feet thanks all three gallons

541
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:53,809
almost three feet dirty

542
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:53,809
not very

543
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:04,930
that's so nice to see bugs

544
00:39:01,219 --> 00:39:04,929
little ones sneaking out here

545
00:39:11,139 --> 00:39:17,768
this is the catatonic that we used in

546
00:39:13,568 --> 00:39:20,980
all the crosses to make a whole new line

547
00:39:17,768 --> 00:39:22,598
of high CBD strains we'll go downstairs

548
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:23,710
and we can actually check some out in

549
00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:26,920
the other room where [ __ ] we're

550
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:30,130
flowering the final phenotype selections

551
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:35,139
yes you can have a look at those they're

552
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:38,980
really interesting high CBD strains I

553
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:47,998
guess good for anti-seizure auntie

554
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:47,998
Caesar auntie it's anti-inflammatory

555
00:39:48,838 --> 00:39:58,139
good for pain arthritis you name it

556
00:39:54,309 --> 00:40:03,249
right like the CBD on the healing chart

557
00:39:58,139 --> 00:40:05,108
incorporates about 80 percent of the

558
00:40:03,248 --> 00:40:09,338
symptoms because the major symptoms you

559
00:40:05,108 --> 00:40:12,838
go for what pain relief anti fascist

560
00:40:09,338 --> 00:40:12,838
city yep

561
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:16,650
appetite stimulation

562
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:30,179
well it's great-looking herb so these

563
00:40:22,769 --> 00:40:32,940
guys are there in week four or five and

564
00:40:30,179 --> 00:40:40,019
we'll probably put them on water for the

565
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:41,820
final four four weeks of water perfect

566
00:40:40,019 --> 00:40:46,108
nice flush just want to get that out

567
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:50,960
there flush your plants if they're not

568
00:40:46,108 --> 00:40:53,009
yellow if the fan leaves aren't yellow

569
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,840
now that I guess they could be purple

570
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:56,490
and things like that another certain

571
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:58,500
strains go certain colors definitely not

572
00:40:56,489 --> 00:41:00,539
overly deep dark right you don't want

573
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:02,849
the dark greens in there that dark green

574
00:41:00,539 --> 00:41:05,400
it's just an indication that the

575
00:41:02,849 --> 00:41:07,890
nutrients are still within the plants

576
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:09,840
you want those leaves to turn yellow but

577
00:41:07,889 --> 00:41:13,159
that's the indication that the nutrients

578
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:13,160
are not in the plan

579
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:21,358
all of us a nice choice there

580
00:41:31,539 --> 00:41:35,099
if I had one more year

581
00:41:36,019 --> 00:41:42,889
I think the entire line available will

582
00:41:39,349 --> 00:41:46,009
be all high CBD I see be the Afghani

583
00:41:42,889 --> 00:41:51,980
dickweed I see VD sweet skunk high CBD

584
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:53,780
Renee I CBD John ghee you know so

585
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:57,710
bringing flavors and bring in what the

586
00:41:53,780 --> 00:42:00,050
people love already and adding the high

587
00:41:57,710 --> 00:42:02,480
CBD to it I like just it just putting

588
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:04,310
the high CBD into it sure right because

589
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:07,250
it's people who go to profile people are

590
00:42:04,309 --> 00:42:10,070
appreciating why not and it's in its a

591
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:12,829
mix it's a mix of the of the of the

592
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:15,830
cannabinoids and terpenoids on the

593
00:42:12,829 --> 00:42:18,319
strains that are already recognized as

594
00:42:15,829 --> 00:42:21,920
medicinal strains and just adding a more

595
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:23,300
medicinal aspect or for it a sheriff

596
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:27,860
it's a winning combination

597
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:30,070
I like it we're an abd you heard it here

598
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:30,070
first

599
00:42:36,059 --> 00:42:39,989
excellent you can see you can see where

600
00:42:38,219 --> 00:42:42,299
that where that one plants is getting a

601
00:42:39,989 --> 00:42:44,459
little bit too much my day oh yeah it's

602
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:47,340
kicking ax kick it out weird but look at

603
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:49,170
that few buds right beside it there it

604
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:50,579
was yeah it's not far away right it's

605
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:52,740
just the difference of like that

606
00:42:50,579 --> 00:42:54,269
six knots and four inches support

607
00:42:52,739 --> 00:42:55,829
assistances yeah there it is right there

608
00:42:54,269 --> 00:42:58,050
you can see you can see a few of them

609
00:42:55,829 --> 00:42:59,759
around the skips spattered around in the

610
00:42:58,050 --> 00:43:03,810
room and they're always there all in

611
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:05,880
exactly the same spot and I think what

612
00:43:03,809 --> 00:43:08,309
it is is not a they're getting the light

613
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:10,140
that comes directly off the ball but B

614
00:43:08,309 --> 00:43:12,599
they're getting the light that reflects

615
00:43:10,139 --> 00:43:15,029
off the shade and from the other side

616
00:43:12,599 --> 00:43:19,009
there's just that magic little zone that

617
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:19,010
there's not much you can do about it

618
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:26,120
go to

619
00:43:33,739 --> 00:43:36,729
oh yeah

620
00:43:37,289 --> 00:43:40,489
some fatties boy

621
00:43:56,179 --> 00:44:02,558
just leaking out it awesomeness

622
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:02,559
everywhere here

623
00:44:02,989 --> 00:44:05,889
how's it going

624
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:29,500
so hard to do

625
00:44:25,869 --> 00:44:33,719
you can need a special skill shots and

626
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:37,800
stuff oh yeah 2022 megapixel camera yeah

627
00:44:33,719 --> 00:44:37,799
it's actually substantial

628
00:44:41,838 --> 00:44:45,199
and looking like they're gonna do they

629
00:44:43,518 --> 00:44:50,379
still have four weeks to or throw yeah

630
00:44:45,199 --> 00:44:50,380
no no they still have probably five

631
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:59,429
ten weeks

632
00:44:54,949 --> 00:45:00,929
sometimes eleven yeah push it

633
00:44:59,429 --> 00:45:03,690
and then I guess you'll see some

634
00:45:00,929 --> 00:45:06,868
variations in the process or do you

635
00:45:03,690 --> 00:45:08,460
think they'll all be around oh yeah so

636
00:45:06,869 --> 00:45:10,230
now that you sort of see these this

637
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:12,358
structure and you see how it sort of

638
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:14,159
takes off like this it's interesting

639
00:45:12,358 --> 00:45:16,769
isn't that when we go down and you see

640
00:45:14,159 --> 00:45:19,038
like the Afghani catatonic and I have

641
00:45:16,769 --> 00:45:22,048
two different phenotypes down there and

642
00:45:19,039 --> 00:45:24,240
what I'm after is is the Afghani

643
00:45:22,048 --> 00:45:26,068
phenotype which actually happened to

644
00:45:24,239 --> 00:45:28,528
have on the next table so you can sort

645
00:45:26,068 --> 00:45:30,179
of look at the Afghani and now that

646
00:45:28,528 --> 00:45:33,028
you've sort of looked at seeing what

647
00:45:30,179 --> 00:45:35,879
this can atomic looks like when when you

648
00:45:33,028 --> 00:45:40,710
see the one Afghani can atomic cross

649
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:42,690
down there you'll see that it's more on

650
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:44,039
the can atonic side and it's not what

651
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:49,829
we're looking for we're looking for the

652
00:45:44,039 --> 00:45:53,460
Afghani traits with the high CBD to it

653
00:45:49,829 --> 00:45:55,079
so right we think we've gotten pretty

654
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:57,298
close something especially with the Rene

655
00:45:55,079 --> 00:46:00,500
I was showing you a little earlier there

656
00:45:57,298 --> 00:46:06,219
the Rene is very nice can't

657
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:06,219
oh yeah alcohol soluble terpenes

658
00:46:23,309 --> 00:46:28,549
beautiful

659
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:33,370
well that the macro lens is out and do a

660
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:33,370
little bit of triangle macro
