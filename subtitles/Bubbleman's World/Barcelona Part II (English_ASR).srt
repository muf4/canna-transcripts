166
00:06:56,839 --> 00:07:01,839
recently posted in that drawing hash

167
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:04,479
group which was like you know get the

168
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:06,079
basic foundation and then if you have

169
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:08,000
people that you are inspired by their

170
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:10,839
hash or how it looks and they live in

171
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,639
your geographic region ask them some

172
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:15,399
questions exactly you know it's no point

173
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:16,680
drying techniques will definitely vary

174
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:19,079
from where you are well that's it you

175
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,439

00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:23,839
moisture in that hash or there's no

178
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:27,560
moisture in that hash or telling people

179
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:30,038
to jar it up after 16 hours of being

180

desicant our moisture levels are so high

186
00:07:42,038 --> 00:07:46,478
in the air that parchment paper is not

187

where oh yeah cannabis is legal

366
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:26,879

member some members can only invite

374
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:50,679
other members was the scenario but it's

375
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:54,360
not 1.6 million as of 2012 what no just
