all right

3
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:29,118
so we're making bubble today here in the

4
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:31,198
snowy Winter Wonderland of the cotney

5
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:32,439

good we're just going to whip off a

7
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:36,679
quick batch Ron's setting everything up

8
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:38,640
with the 20 gon into the bucket to drain

9
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:40,238
into the tub uh it should be good we're

10

snow and we'll be right back all right

13
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:50,719
so we got to get some snow clean area a

14
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:52,479
nice clean area snow is generally not

15
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:56,239
the cleanest stuff even though it might

16
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:58,119
come across as maybe that it is it's

17
00:00:56,238 --> 00:01:01,280
not you

18
00:00:58,119 --> 00:01:03,359
uh you want to get the cleanest

19
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,280

21
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:10,320
built last year

22
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,200

36
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:47,439
throw that away and the

37
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:49,640
bottom this is Ron's private snow

38
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:50,919
collection I didn't know you had a pool

39
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,640
oh I just put it up for the kids last

40
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,640

okay go like this

43
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,320
here like that oh that's great

44
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:05,840
snow say you can't go wrong with that

45
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:09,000
top

46
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,000
layer take

47
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:31,280
it buddy what's up buddy what's I can

48
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:33,159
barely see you in there of a piece of

49
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,239
like a tree a

50
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:37,799
Lim you know like from the trees and

51
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:41,000
something fall down the first B catches

52
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:43,959
all that right yes but we do want to

53
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,479
make sure that this is clean so yeah we

54
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:49,439
don't want any dirt no dirt at all no

55
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:51,560
there might be some pine needles that's

56
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:53,878
okay pine needles aren't as big of a

57
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:56,719
problem cuz we can separate them out but

58
00:02:53,878 --> 00:03:00,000
tiny little Flex of stone tiny little

59
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:01,919
bits of dust and sand and stuff it could

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,120
potentially sink

61
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:05,119
so all

62
00:03:05,878 --> 00:03:09,719
right so what we're doing right now is

63
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:11,280
we're collecting snow to chill our water

64
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:13,479
it's probably unnecessary because it's

65
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,878
so cold out right now but it's a cool

66
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:17,199
thing to show you guys that you can use

67
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:21,199
snow to chill your water you can also

68
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:23,719
actually make little tiny snow balls and

69
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:26,598
if you soak these little guys in water

70
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:28,438
for the short amount of time they turn

71
00:03:26,598 --> 00:03:31,839
into ice

72
00:03:28,438 --> 00:03:33,519
balls so you can get many many many of

73
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,120
these little ice balls in and you can

74
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,319
actually run a batch without ice cubes

75
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:41,360
we're not going to do that today cuz we

76
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:41,359
have Cubes but it's something you can

77
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,120
do all right so we're going to take this

78
00:03:43,318 --> 00:03:50,399
snow back and make some Bubble Run you

79
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,400
bet all right be

80
00:03:55,878 --> 00:04:00,560
careful oh Ron yeah what what are all

81
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:03,200
these here that's just all the stocks

82
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,199
left over for

83
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:09,239
my oh that's just the last crop he says

84
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,239
eh that's

85
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:15,280
great did you see how I made this dark

86
00:04:13,318 --> 00:04:18,719
room in the end I saw the dark room's

87
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:22,319
great yeah great access that's kind of

88
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:24,080
looks cool with the snow all over

89
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:26,599
the the

90
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:28,719
pots grower

91
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:31,600
supremus beautiful little zone for

92
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,600
making bubble today

93
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:41,199
rock and roll so I'm going to come over

94
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:42,399
here and just turn you real quick so

95
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,360
mark C you're the bubble man so I'm

96
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:44,959
going to ask you things even though I

97
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,280
made bubble half many times I still

98
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:48,079
think that there's always something to

99
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:49,359
learn cuz whenever you come here AB I

100
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:51,519
always catch on to something makes my

101
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,919
life easier absolutely so for this y

102
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:55,279
cooling up the water we've got a couple

103
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:57,519
of options what I would normally do I

104
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:59,198
would put that snow into the water and

105
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:01,758
then I would filter that water as we

106
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,319
poured into oh nice good idea yeah so if

107
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,199
you want so let's take these bags put

108
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:07,240
them here for a second put this here

109
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,038
with the water and pour from here sure

110
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,400
and this is store bought ice I would not

111
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:12,879
normally use this but because we have so

112
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:15,079
much snow and because the water is going

113
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:16,839
to be so cold and because it's what we

114
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:18,758
had access to we're going to make it

115
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:19,799
work today so if I'm in the way here I

116
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:22,000
hope I don't walk so we're going to put

117
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,520
the snow into there sure we've left the

118
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,639
water outside for an hour just to get

119
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:28,599
cold in the temperature of the our cold

120
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:31,720
is outside yeah so there's the water the

121
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:34,560
snow going together nice cuz like cuz

122
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:37,639
like you say Mark the colder the water

123
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,639
the better right

124
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:44,318
exactly oh I love to get my hands dirty

125
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:47,360
we just D no I think that's good right

126
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:48,919
now like look it so what snow what ice

127
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,240
does you can really see it bubbling you

128
00:05:48,918 --> 00:05:53,198
see the bubbles coming out yeah what ice

129
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:56,199
does in water is it's a thermal reaction

130
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:59,000
that it actually pulls warmth out of the

131
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:01,879
water and that's how the ice melts ice

132
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,478
doesn't act add cold to the water it

133
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:05,918
pulls warmth out of the water and makes

134
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:08,038
it cold well makes sense when you think

135
00:06:05,918 --> 00:06:09,560
about it's trippy though right so we'll

136
00:06:08,038 --> 00:06:11,598
let this sit just for a few minutes

137
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,439
trippy let's have a Trippy Stick exactly

138
00:06:11,598 --> 00:06:16,079
we'll go Trippy Stick we can we can see

139
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:17,800
now that the snow is um hey isn't it

140
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:19,598
always time for a Trippy Stick it's

141
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:22,079
always time for a triy stick I'll go

142
00:06:19,598 --> 00:06:23,519
grab one one away I just want to pull a

143
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:26,159
little bit of these you can see that

144
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:28,240
snow was actually very very clean

145
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,840
compared to most yeah there's a little

146
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,360
bit of pine needles just like you said

147
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:34,478
there would be Y and because of that

148
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,520
we're going to filter this water

149
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:39,719
probably through a 25 micron B what a

150
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:41,159
good idea yeah and let me tell you this

151
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:44,319
is

152
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,720
cold holy Jesus that's well God was nice

153
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,560
to us though he gave us a cold day but

154
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:50,199
not a ridiculously cold day we're happy

155
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:54,120
poror Frost everywhere it's it's really

156
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:55,120
nice it's very nice okay so um I think

157
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,000
we're going to be okay we're not going

158
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,240
to need much more of that what we are

159
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,839
going to do is we're going to we're

160
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,319
going to use the 5 gon clean bucket okay

161
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:05,399
and we're going to filter right into the

162
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:07,639
bubble now okay so I'm going to go get

163
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:11,038
the bags real quick yes I'm going to go

164
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:11,038
War my hands we'll be back in a second

165
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,879

so just in snow so these this is our

169
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:51,560
bucket y we're going to be using fits

170
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,560
the bags like a

171
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:55,918
glove do you want some uh some uh

172
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,159
Sometimes some people they put too much

173
00:07:55,918 --> 00:07:59,120
water in I know it's CU they're big

174
00:07:57,158 --> 00:08:01,279
bubble don't have down much they put the

175
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,280
the the straps for motorcycles you tie

176
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:05,198
your motorcycles down on here St the

177
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:06,918
slide that's a hassle though yeah I

178
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,158
don't find that my bags slide too much

179
00:08:06,918 --> 00:08:11,279
when I put them all inside one another

180
00:08:09,158 --> 00:08:13,279
there's really no where for them to go

181
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:16,158
yeah you know especially if you've done

182
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:18,918
this process of you know fitting them in

183
00:08:16,158 --> 00:08:19,879
nice now are you going to screen first

184
00:08:18,918 --> 00:08:21,359
and then pardon me are you going to

185
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:22,840
screen that water first yeah yeah yeah

186
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,158
you're right I want to uh we'll use the

187
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:29,719
45 it'll be it'll be small enough the 25

188
00:08:25,158 --> 00:08:32,038
will be maybe a little too slow so let

189
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,038
do

190
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:38,519
that you want to come uh with some

191
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,918
buckets pour it through with ice in it

192
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:42,918
if yeah yeah it's

193
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:51,000
yeah sure as we're pouring through I

194
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,799
don't know where you're going bud Oh Oh

195
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,679
I thought this I thought this way stra

196
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:56,399
no you got to pay attention Okay we're

197
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:58,239
going into the bucket that bucket is not

198
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,919
going to help us that bucket's going to

199
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,159
help us when we filter everything out

200
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:04,958
yeah okay

201
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:06,159
I we are moving quick I actually noticed

202
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:08,599
when you poured it I was like wow he

203
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:10,000
poured that really fast I'm surprised it

204

00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:23,759
now okay let me just get this

209
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:26,879

blowing out to get the the chloroform

276
00:12:54,078 --> 00:12:57,359
gone instead of reclaiming it yeah

277
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:59,759
evaporating it out evaporate out I put

278

356
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:11,480
that so you put two bags ice in first I

357
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:15,159
put three bags of ice in okay three

358
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:19,278

also that's okay I'll wait for you to

363
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:35,079
stop so they can hear me yes uh often I

364
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:37,600
would do a mix when I put this in I

365
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:39,719
would uh you know put a little ice put a

366

little leaf put a little ice put a

367
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:44,000
little leaf I don't have time today this

368
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:48,120
is a quick rushed batch I'm leaving for

369
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,318
the airport in probably an hour and so

370
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,919
we're going to show you what can be done

371
00:16:49,318 --> 00:16:53,958
on the quick we had too much fun we

372
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:56,120
didn't get TI time to do work we did so

373
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:57,679
we can move this around a little bit and

374
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,159
get that fresh frozen trim I wouldn't

375
00:16:57,679 --> 00:17:02,000
suggest doing this with with dry

376
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:04,119
material because uh well the crystals

377
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,558
will just fall right off the bag all

378
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:08,719
right let's get this big boy in here on

379
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:10,959
okay move these other bags oh yeah look

380
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,959
at

381
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:18,120
that okay

382
00:17:15,078 --> 00:17:20,798
so perfect amount of water we've got in

383
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:23,639
there um really just a matter of turning

384
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:25,759
our washing machine on let's give it

385
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:27,400
about oh I don't know a couple of

386
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:30,400
minutes

387
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,400
on

388
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:36,440
all right the water's already changed

389
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:37,319
color doesn't take long to get that

390
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:40,519
color

391
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:40,519

3

395
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:55,558
minutes and then we'll come back and

396
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:57,679
we'll filter it through the bubble

397
00:17:55,558 --> 00:17:59,440
bags and we'll make a little bubble what

398
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,960

doing all the work for us extracting the

411
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:44,360
glandular Tricom head off of the plant

412
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:47,678
body prison and isolating them into

413
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:51,879
seven different Micron sizes I got to

414
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,880
say bubble hash is a good

415
00:18:54,119 --> 00:19:01,599
thing all right so we're

416
00:18:57,319 --> 00:19:04,158
back we're back guys we're uh going to

417
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:05,839
filter the bags through the bucket we

418
00:19:04,159 --> 00:19:08,919
don't have a ton of time to waste so

419
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:12,439
this is a real quick simple move click

420
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:16,320
the button to drain and it drains you

421
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:18,519
can see the color of the water is gold I

422
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:21,119
have no no

423
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:24,200
um no doubts of the quality that this is

424
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:26,839
going to be now I'm already seeing a

425
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,840
pool of

426
00:19:26,919 --> 00:19:31,600
contaminants we'll make sure we

427
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:36,038
definitely you know pull that bag up and

428
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:38,599
really get that screen as flat as we

429
00:19:36,038 --> 00:19:40,919
can there we go that creates a lot more

430
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:42,719
screen surface area one of the things I

431
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:45,360
like to talk about is you know a lot of

432
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,839
guys want to know why they can't buy a 5

433
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:51,279
gallon set of bags with a

434
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:53,959
220 20 gallon set

435
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:55,918
now the bags were designed for a certain

436
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:59,400
amount of herb to release a certain

437
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:01,600
amount of resin for the screen diameter

438
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:05,280
for that size of screen when you put too

439
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:08,399
much resin or too much herb in uh for

440
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:10,240
such a small screen what happens is the

441
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,880
160 bag starts catching more than it

442
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:15,319
would normally catch and in doing so it

443
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,960
creates a catch and the 90 and the 73

444
00:20:15,319 --> 00:20:18,839
and some of those better grades they get

445
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,240
caught up in the higher grades we don't

446
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:23,000
want that to

447
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:25,558
happen so we use the right size bag for

448
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,839
the right amount I think today we ran

449
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:31,240
probably less than a kilo really maybe a

450
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:34,839
kilo and a half wet yeah you know 1,500

451
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:38,919
G wet so this is about a 200 g 250 to

452
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:41,199
300 G run and so yeah whenever I'm in

453
00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:45,240
the cies making my bubble hash or dry

454
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:47,038
sift Buddy's right there next to

455
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:49,038
me hey

456
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:53,158
bud what's

457
00:20:49,038 --> 00:20:56,359
this is that the bubble water you got

458
00:20:53,159 --> 00:20:58,679
like bubble oh yeah look at that yah

459
00:20:56,359 --> 00:21:01,439
look he's like oh that bubble water is

460
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:03,640
making me itchy making me itchy

461
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:06,720
man good amount of water here I guess we

462
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:06,720
could start filtering this

463
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:17,519
too so it's always a nice idea to put a

464
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:19,480
a tap in on your bucket especially for a

465
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:20,918
20-gallon bucket although this bucket is

466
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,599
a little shrunk down I'd say it's a

467
00:21:20,919 --> 00:21:25,159
little smaller than your average full

468
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:26,879
size garbage can still got the same size

469
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:28,600
of screens we still use the proper

470
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,720
amount of water so

471
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:32,439
I'm pretty sure we're good to go that's

472
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,919
a nice looking process I bet you film

473
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,480
will look nice the water falling down

474
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:38,400
there and the water falling down there

475
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:40,759
yeah you know it is really nice actually

476
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:43,440
the hose right here let's just give the

477
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:46,599
old hose you can see a lot of resin on

478
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:48,600
the bag I used to pull the bags first

479
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:51,519
well yeah but I want

480
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:52,719
to I want to shoot all that resin down

481
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:57,038
yeah

482
00:21:52,720 --> 00:22:00,038
yeah me lift that upway spr

483
00:21:57,038 --> 00:22:00,038
go

484
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:07,678
perfect little

485
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:09,879
more like lift it up a little out of the

486
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,880
we can yeah got to squish it like this

487
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:14,400
when it's tight you always put your

488
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:16,520
hands in and flatten it out a little

489
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,960
yep right

490
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:20,918
in all right there we go that's the way

491
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,440
to get it out that out there go I like

492
00:22:20,919 --> 00:22:23,440
to hold it up to

493
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:32,319
drip

494
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:32,320
that's an average run for people right

495
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:36,359
here okay excuse me right you agree M

496
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:39,158
this would be an average amount for

497
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:41,599
people to run

498
00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:43,200
yeah all right the water's still very

499
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:44,519
golden there you want to hold that want

500
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,679
to show the folks at home what we're

501
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:49,558
dealing with up close

502
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:51,960
here so we still got a very gold water

503
00:22:49,558 --> 00:22:53,730
we've got the pump

504
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:56,828
on

505
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:56,828
[Music]

506
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:03,640
uh on yet no might be a little clog here

507
00:23:02,278 --> 00:23:06,539
all right so we had a little kink in our

508
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:09,900
hose she's draining nicely

509
00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:09,899
[Music]

510
00:23:11,798 --> 00:23:16,839
now I get a little Shake around not yet

511
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,720
please okay that's okay it's just

512
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:21,240
looking real nice it's it it went from

513
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:23,558
yellow to White I really like that

514
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:25,558
shot that is

515
00:23:23,558 --> 00:23:28,158
nice all right so let's give it a little

516
00:23:25,558 --> 00:23:30,000
more hose water you got it clean up that

517
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:32,679
last little bit of resin the stuff is a

518
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,599
nice little spray so it's not crazy mhm

519
00:23:32,679 --> 00:23:37,038
for sure it's more likely to clean it

520
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:37,038
properly

521
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:49,080
too the hair down

522
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,679
there got the hair

523
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:52,240
[Music]

524
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:54,720
out

525
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,919
okay all right so we're good there you

526
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,240
can turn the drain off I don't know if

527
00:23:56,919 --> 00:24:01,679
you're on but I like sometimes go like

528
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:03,000
this here yeah I'm on like that yeah

529
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,080
give it a little lift and get that last

530
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,240
little bit out sure it's nice and clear

531
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:09,000
water too that's a good sign okay I like

532
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:11,759
that water to be coming out clear

533
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,919
towards the end once you filtered okay

534
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:17,158
and our tap is still

535
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,159
uh still

536
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:21,159
running okay so we got everything

537
00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:22,919
drained it's in the bucket we've got our

538
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:24,440
water and our res sitting here Mo you

539
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:28,278
know we we got rid of at least a couple

540
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:30,558
of gallons oh yeah easily like uh five

541
00:24:28,278 --> 00:24:34,119
full gallons of water in there which

542
00:24:30,558 --> 00:24:37,558
means we only have about 10 plus left in

543
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:40,278
here what we can start doing now is we

544
00:24:37,558 --> 00:24:43,278
can start pulling these

545
00:24:40,278 --> 00:24:43,278
bags

546
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:51,079
so um we're going to do I want to show

547
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:54,319
people the process

548
00:24:51,079 --> 00:24:56,759
Ron that's not no it's fine if you want

549
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:59,439
to grab your spray bottle you

550
00:24:56,759 --> 00:25:01,038
can

551
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,120
you just got to get back in the camera

552
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:06,240
view yeah I'm going to move the camera

553
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:07,519
off the tripod while you do this okay

554
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,159
okay

555
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:12,599
so this is a simple process that you can

556
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,960
do with a little spray bottle and you

557
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:18,359
can clean the bag by literally going all

558
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:20,840
around the top edges spraying everything

559
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:23,319
down into the

560
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:24,759
bucket that spray is here can I just do

561
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:28,798
this real fast all right so we're using

562
00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:30,079
the hose to clean the top of the bag

563
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:31,960
we were going to use a sprayer but his

564
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:33,678
sprayer was just next to useless so

565
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:37,600
we'll just use all you need is a little

566
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:41,000
tiny bit of forced water and

567
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:43,250
uh you can do this real fast let's just

568
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,480
say there we

569
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:47,079
[Music]

570
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:49,399
go so there's the hose cleaning

571
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:51,519
everything into the middle just gives us

572
00:25:49,398 --> 00:25:55,439
a nice Easy Pile to clean out if you

573
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:55,440
want to pull that out with a spoon R

574
00:25:55,839 --> 00:26:02,319
Yep this is just a two 20 bag so really

575
00:25:58,519 --> 00:26:02,319
this is just pretty much

576
00:26:04,119 --> 00:26:07,299
mulch yeah just throw that on the old

577
00:26:06,278 --> 00:26:09,519
screen

578
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:11,918
[Applause]

579
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:13,480
there okay so right off the bat I would

580
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:16,159
I here's a great thing to show you guys

581
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:18,599
CU what Ron did here is what you don't

582
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:22,600
ever want to do you want to keep your

583
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:24,199
resin organized and in place so what

584
00:26:22,599 --> 00:26:25,398
happens when we come and grab the next

585
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,480
resin where are we going to put it are

586
00:26:25,398 --> 00:26:27,918
we going to throw it over here and then

587
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,399
one over here and one over here and one

588
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,600
over there there's going to be no order

589
00:26:29,398 --> 00:26:33,119
and people aren't going to know what

590
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:35,038
they have so what I have always done is

591
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:36,798
I've always started first of all it's a

592
00:26:35,038 --> 00:26:39,079
sandwich it's cut right down the middle

593
00:26:36,798 --> 00:26:40,918
and it folds so this is the half we're

594
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:44,199
going to use and we're going to start by

595
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:46,120
putting our 220 right up at the top and

596
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:47,600
we're going to put our 190 here and our

597
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:50,038
160 here and at the end we'll have a

598
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:51,398
nice row of our different hashes and

599
00:26:50,038 --> 00:26:53,679
we'll be able to close the pressing

600
00:26:51,398 --> 00:26:55,599
screen over top of it and remove some of

601
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,120
that moisture so let's get on with that

602
00:26:55,599 --> 00:27:01,278
real quick all right so Ron's now going

603
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:03,839
to rinse out the 220 bag that we just um

604
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:05,839
cleaned um because it's the 220 bag we

605
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:08,759
didn't have to clean it a huge

606
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:10,398
amount um it's a contaminant bag and we

607
00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:13,240
already used the 220 bag inside the

608
00:27:10,398 --> 00:27:15,639
bubble now so it's okay to just flip it

609
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:17,839
inside out as Ron's doing here and rinse

610
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:20,600
it off into a bucket somewhere with a

611
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:23,038
nice uh Cold Water Rinse make sure you

612
00:27:20,599 --> 00:27:25,319
clean the screen well with cold water

613
00:27:23,038 --> 00:27:26,839
and then hang that screen or bag he's

614
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:29,240
got a nice line right here we're just

615
00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:30,720
going to hang the bags right away cuz

616
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:34,240
it's very important not to put your bags

617
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:36,519
away wet very very

618
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:39,399
important you never want a buildup of

619
00:27:36,519 --> 00:27:41,240
the of the of the car another little tip

620
00:27:39,398 --> 00:27:42,759
here as I'm pulling this 160 bag out

621
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:44,079
there was a lot of resin on the tops of

622
00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:47,038
the screens and I could have pulled the

623
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:49,839
bag out but what I did was I dropped it

624
00:27:47,038 --> 00:27:51,720
back in and I let that resin cool

625
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:53,480
towards the center it'll just give us

626
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:57,319
less amount of time that we have to work

627
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:58,919
with the hose or the spray bottle we

628
00:27:57,319 --> 00:28:00,839
have a spray bottle it's just not a very

629
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:02,840
good one you do want a spray bottle with

630
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:05,079
a bit of of pressure something that

631
00:28:02,839 --> 00:28:07,439
actually you know will give you a good

632
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:08,918
amount of of pressure so you can move

633
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:12,600
the resin around and get it get it where

634
00:28:08,919 --> 00:28:12,600
you want it that's a good amount of

635
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:17,798
pressure yeah pulling the resin right

636
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:19,720
into the center perfect Ron and then

637
00:28:17,798 --> 00:28:22,278
also sometimes if there's contaminant in

638
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:23,640
the resin I don't see this as often but

639
00:28:22,278 --> 00:28:25,359
I've heard a few different people talk

640
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:27,320
about it as a tip so I'll share it with

641
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:29,678
you guys that you can use this to sort

642
00:28:27,319 --> 00:28:31,359
of of wash the resin over the screen

643
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:33,798
some people are doing that I personally

644
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:35,398
don't like to expose the resin to more

645
00:28:33,798 --> 00:28:37,000
water than it needs to be because

646
00:28:35,398 --> 00:28:40,398
especially forced water will leech out

647
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:42,240
water soluble Tes but um definitely this

648
00:28:40,398 --> 00:28:43,439
is a great idea just to pull the resin

649
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,679
into the middle of the screen you can

650
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,558
see how easy that made it for him

651
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:50,000
perfect Ron right under that 220 as

652
00:28:47,558 --> 00:28:52,119
close as you can get it without touching

653
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,960
and uh we'll pull the next bag for it

654
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:56,918
bud so this one is the 160 this is

655
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,679
generally when you're using nice

656
00:28:56,919 --> 00:29:00,840
material like the

657
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:03,519
watermelon um that you'll start seeing

658
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:04,959
an actual smokable product that's not to

659
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:08,278
say you're going to see that with every

660
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:11,480
strain it's just not the case but you

661
00:29:08,278 --> 00:29:11,480
definitely will see it with

662
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:18,679
waterm now you could also have this

663
00:29:16,278 --> 00:29:21,480
little bucket here that I'm using you

664
00:29:18,679 --> 00:29:23,600
could have it on a stand it could easily

665
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:25,599
be on upside down on a bucket and be

666
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:28,719
higher for me so I don't have to do all

667
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:30,480
this bending down but uh

668
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:34,120
we're just setting this up makeshift

669
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:36,558
today it's not super super

670
00:29:34,119 --> 00:29:39,359
duper important to get everything set up

671
00:29:36,558 --> 00:29:42,038
exactly perfect cuz it's nice to know

672
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:45,199
with bubble that you can actually whip

673
00:29:42,038 --> 00:29:48,278
off a batch and still literally make an

674
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,278
amazing quality

675
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,360
product with uh you know a little corner

676
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:55,158
cut here and there like oh we used

677
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:58,558
floridated ice oops well we had to um

678
00:29:55,159 --> 00:30:01,039
but we did use the snow um this bucket

679
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:02,480
is actually full of snow right now and

680
00:30:01,038 --> 00:30:05,000
it's kind of neat because it's making a

681
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:08,000
really cold area for me to collect the

682
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,200
bubble out of perfect oh that's great a

683
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,440
little bit of a little bit of water

684
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,440
that's

685
00:30:12,679 --> 00:30:17,960
good that's very

686
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:19,240
good ready to clean yeah you can put

687
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,798
that inside now Mark you taught me a

688
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:23,278
long time ago about now when we I get to

689
00:30:20,798 --> 00:30:25,200
the B bags yes rinsing those into the

690
00:30:23,278 --> 00:30:26,839
back into the uh through through the

691
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,679
system you know I wouldn't I wouldn't

692
00:30:26,839 --> 00:30:31,439
put this personally into the the 90 but

693
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:35,159
I would definitely put it into the 120

694
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:36,880
so yeah rinse it inside out in here yeah

695
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:38,240
this is why why throw it away right yeah

696
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,679
you can even do this you don't even need

697
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:43,558
to do that you just

698
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:45,798
dip now the resin's gone and now you

699
00:30:43,558 --> 00:30:48,200
rinse the bag with the cold water

700
00:30:45,798 --> 00:30:51,200
perfect and I'll pull the

701
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:52,399
120 oh man this bag does not want to

702
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:55,880
work

703
00:30:52,398 --> 00:30:59,638
off oh the heada cop does it would have

704
00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:04,000
been a time in the past where we would

705
00:30:59,638 --> 00:31:06,638
have run away but not

706
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,440
today nice release of the water in an

707
00:31:06,638 --> 00:31:11,759
instant by just lifting the bag allowing

708
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:15,200
the resin to lift and allowing the water

709
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:17,079
to rush through nice and quick nice

710
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,360
which nice return on that I love that

711
00:31:17,079 --> 00:31:21,678
put this snow down a bit more I love the

712
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:23,839
snow in here do you yeah it's making a

713
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:26,278
nice cold atmosphere and you know of

714
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:28,240
course bubble loves the cold you don't

715
00:31:26,278 --> 00:31:29,798
need to have a warm warm environment

716
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,000
when you're making bubble hash that is

717
00:31:29,798 --> 00:31:32,000
for

718
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:40,359
sure how's that for a yield run nice

719
00:31:38,038 --> 00:31:42,480
that's good yeah but we've got a little

720
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:44,638
problem what well we've got air in the

721
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:46,240
bag because it's so tight okay and the

722
00:31:44,638 --> 00:31:48,199
air won't come out so you see how it

723
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,679
won't let the bag you see what it's

724
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:53,200
doing that's air okay so got the air

725
00:31:50,679 --> 00:31:55,679
yeah we got to lift it up unfold

726
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,880
it oh that what a yield that a little

727
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:58,080
bit of run let's show him with the

728
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:01,000
camera

729
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:04,558
wow cuz that's a nice

730
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:09,000
pull there we go that is a nice pull a

731
00:32:04,558 --> 00:32:09,000
nice color oh yeah it's going to be

732
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:15,319
beautiful excellent you want to spray

733
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:15,319
that up a bit you you

734
00:32:18,798 --> 00:32:23,519
bet great way to clean the bag

735
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:29,079
efficiently

736
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:36,079
excellent all right that's perfect we'll

737
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:37,798
let that settle the water a tiny bit

738
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:40,638
yeah as you do that you'll actually pull

739
00:32:37,798 --> 00:32:42,599
water out yeah you can use the air yeah

740
00:32:40,638 --> 00:32:44,199
there we go to pull the water out look

741
00:32:42,599 --> 00:32:46,199
at the little bit of green on the edge

742
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:48,480
there yeah almost like a little bit of

743
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:51,639
leftover chlorophyll or

744
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:54,120
something very nice all right scoop it

745
00:32:51,638 --> 00:32:54,119
out

746
00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:01,360
okay oh that's thick yeah it's thick

747
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:04,799
that's you know that's like 10

748
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:07,599
G easily and we didn't put much in

749
00:33:04,798 --> 00:33:09,519
that's funny thing full bag I get big

750
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:13,000
bigger yields out of my 20 gallons when

751
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:13,000
I put like a kilo of dry

752
00:33:15,558 --> 00:33:20,798
in tiny Ting of green I know we'll see

753
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:23,159
go away this is going to be golden well

754
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:24,759
I know the material too though so all

755
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:27,120
right that's perfect you can flip that

756
00:33:24,759 --> 00:33:30,000
and put that last little bit of resin

757
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:31,359
get it exactly and your spoon as well

758
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,159
okay you have my spoon as well yeah you

759
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:35,079
don't want to leave that just to dry

760
00:33:33,159 --> 00:33:36,360
okay yeah cuz that's hard it's raw hard

761
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:37,720
just a little rinse like that yeah just

762
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:39,158
a quick little rinse like that is all

763
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:41,440
you need that's a nice touch to tell

764
00:33:39,159 --> 00:33:42,960
tell people I'll tell you absolutely

765
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,720
awesome you want some help lifting that

766
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,679
oh no we don't need to hose it right cuz

767
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:49,440
we're rinsing it right we're rinsing it

768
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:51,120
exactly okay I got it perfect you want

769
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,240
to get it inside out though not right

770
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:55,558
side out I usually put my hand on the

771
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:58,038
bottom yeah and push and just sort of I

772
00:33:55,558 --> 00:34:00,000
close it so when I push P it up I'm not

773
00:33:58,038 --> 00:34:02,319
pushing the resin onto the side walls of

774
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,359
the bag okay so when I grab it I kind of

775
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:07,960
close it up perfect yeah nice

776
00:34:04,359 --> 00:34:10,519
rinse excellent Ron is a great helper

777
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:12,960
he's very eager to do things the way you

778
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:14,440
ask him to do them good job Ron well

779
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:17,119
people have to learn the right way right

780
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:20,480
well it's important right all right so

781
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:23,200
we'll rinse that off I was by J and I'll

782
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,199
get to the next

783
00:34:23,838 --> 00:34:28,878
bag all right here we go

784
00:34:30,918 --> 00:34:35,719
okay so Ron's cleaning the 120 bag I'm

785
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:39,000
going to pull the 90 bag this is going

786
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:43,358
to be old this is going to be a good bag

787
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:45,440
I can feel it it's also very heavy it's

788
00:34:43,358 --> 00:34:47,639
got about two two full gallons of water

789
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:50,800
in it and you see how slow it's draining

790
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:50,800
watch how fast I can make it

791
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:55,519
drain does that knock any of the glasss

792
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:56,599
through the screens that you might no

793
00:34:55,519 --> 00:34:58,039
the glands aren't going to be pushed

794
00:34:56,599 --> 00:34:59,960
through a screen that's too small for

795
00:34:58,039 --> 00:35:01,960
them to go through I mean even the

796
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:04,440
pressure of lifting the bag out of the

797
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:06,920
water and that 20 gallons of water

798
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:08,880
pushing through the bottom of the screen

799
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:11,920
has to be way more pressure than these

800
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:13,320
little shakes okay perfect yeah all I

801
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:15,880
know is there's always great resin on my

802
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:18,760
90u bag shake it you w't break it shake

803
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:22,000
it you shake it

804
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:25,359
990u all right this is exciting I love

805
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,358
pulling the 90 when it looks

806
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,800
lovely

807
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,159
beautiful perfect let it pull right into

808
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:45,559
the middle there okay got get a little

809
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:47,920
slower for a second we'll just let it

810
00:35:45,559 --> 00:35:47,920
kind of

811
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:55,800
drain little

812
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,800
tight just for the

813
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,800
picture

814
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:04,519
my fingers

815
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:04,519
there looks

816
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:08,839
good all right you want to scoop it out

817
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:13,000
with the spoon you

818
00:36:08,838 --> 00:36:15,759
bet so there's another 6 to 8 gr

819
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:18,599
there can't wait for the yellow bag I

820
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:20,240
love the yellow bag I don't know why but

821
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:21,838
maybe a little less maybe four it's hard

822
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:25,719
to say it's thick isn't it yeah it is

823
00:36:21,838 --> 00:36:28,719
very thick very thick oh yeah it is a

824
00:36:25,719 --> 00:36:28,719
thicky

825
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:36,800
nice maneuver well done and with the

826
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:39,079
hand I'll go up to the other side now up

827
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:41,079
there yep if you're all filled up we can

828
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:43,440
use the other pressing screen as a

829
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:45,160
sandwich to put right over top of it oh

830
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:47,079
perfect

831
00:36:45,159 --> 00:36:48,960
beautiful get a little shot here of

832
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:50,800
water yeah we can rinse that out there's

833
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,838
a lot of 90 there but it's just going

834
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,960
into the

835
00:36:52,838 --> 00:36:56,838
73 if you want to pick that up though

836
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:59,960
you can put it with the 90 I'll just

837
00:36:56,838 --> 00:36:59,960
last enough that's for

838
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:14,759
sure I just had a really good idea that

839
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:17,559
I want to share with you guys what if we

840
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:20,640
were to have a tiny little compressor

841
00:37:17,559 --> 00:37:22,799
that sucks air in the bottom of a

842
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:26,199
special bucket designed to place the

843
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:28,359
bags into you put the bags in you

844
00:37:26,199 --> 00:37:30,559
tighten the screen and then you turn the

845
00:37:28,358 --> 00:37:34,159
little air pressure on and it sucks

846
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:35,239
water it sucks air out of the bucket run

847
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:37,199
can you see what I'm saying you know

848
00:37:35,239 --> 00:37:38,719
when we put the the bucket down the bag

849
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:40,559
over the bucket how it creates these air

850
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:42,679
pockets what if you had a little hole in

851
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:44,960
here with an air pump not pumping air

852
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:47,679
but sucking one it's the valve like a

853
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:49,599
sealer I don't it needs to suck air Ron

854
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:51,399
you understand it needs to suck the air

855
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:53,559
out of the hash you see that movement

856
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:57,039
there uh I think this might be a good

857
00:37:53,559 --> 00:38:00,039
idea stay tuned for potential new new

858
00:37:57,039 --> 00:38:02,079
bubble invention I like the

859
00:38:00,039 --> 00:38:03,639
idea do you see what I'm saying though

860
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:05,720
you know when we put the bag over top of

861
00:38:03,639 --> 00:38:08,078
the bucket and we push it down you know

862
00:38:05,719 --> 00:38:11,318
how it sucks the air and the hash gets

863
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:13,039
like perfect for pulling off the screen

864
00:38:11,318 --> 00:38:14,559
I would like to create a little product

865
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:16,159
like

866
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:19,559
that

867
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:21,559
awesome done deal not done till the bags

868
00:38:19,559 --> 00:38:23,480
are clean yeah you want to make your

869
00:38:21,559 --> 00:38:25,039
bags last forever hey it looks so good

870
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:26,920
the way you've hung the bags too the

871
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:29,838
black one's going to go there yeah and

872
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:32,358
then the 90 oh this is real

873
00:38:29,838 --> 00:38:34,599
nice in case you guys haven't noticed

874
00:38:32,358 --> 00:38:37,960
yet Ron is a quality

875
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:40,680
guy and a hard worker I'm very happy to

876
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:42,720
be spending time with him here and

877
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:45,118
getting to play with his resin and

878
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:47,078
getting to wash and dry sift the the

879
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:48,440
buds and just hanging out with all the

880
00:38:47,079 --> 00:38:50,680
great people here in the cies it's been

881
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:53,400
a great trip I'm really uh can't wait to

882
00:38:50,679 --> 00:38:53,399
get back that's for

883
00:38:55,519 --> 00:38:58,519
sure

884
00:39:15,719 --> 00:39:19,799
little bit of a green tinge but I know

885
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:22,920
it's going to come out these two pieces

886
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:25,440
here especially are going to be very

887
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:28,079
golden sometimes when you w wash fresh

888
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,639
material um you'll release a little bit

889
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:31,680
of chlorophyll I'm not going to say that

890
00:39:29,639 --> 00:39:34,719
it's water soluble but it it does come

891
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:36,279
out somehow into the water and it some

892
00:39:34,719 --> 00:39:38,078
I've seen it in the hash and then the

893
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:39,519
hash dries and it seems to disappear

894
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:41,119
with the moisture that's in the hash so

895
00:39:39,519 --> 00:39:43,079
it's the color is actually in the water

896
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:46,599
not the hash and we'll show you that

897
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:50,760
later with uh photographic

898
00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:52,920
evidence want to pull that 73 U bag yeah

899
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:54,160
should we do it this is your bag Ron why

900
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,400

901
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:58,399
I love this

902
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,400
bag

beautiful yeah check it out check it out

904
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:11,519

905
00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:15,920
go yeah nice e well that sure makes me

906
00:40:11,519 --> 00:40:19,000
feel better it's gentler

907
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:19,720
boom all right we can take that over to

908
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,199
the

909
00:40:19,719 --> 00:40:24,239
bucket yeah i' shave these handles off

910
00:40:22,199 --> 00:40:27,078
for future reference for a bubble bucket

911
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:28,639
yeah be perfect okay

912
00:40:27,079 --> 00:40:30,920
bag would go over it's that's what the

913
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:33,279
bag's getting tight on actually okay

914
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:34,760
yeah you're right here we go there we go

915
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,720
like that idea now imagine I had a

916
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:38,720
little pump that sucked air from the

917
00:40:36,719 --> 00:40:42,039
bottom of this bag and and you just saw

918
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:42,039
these bubbles disappear in an

919
00:40:55,318 --> 00:40:59,639
instant

920
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:01,920
he knows how good our hoodies are our

921
00:40:59,639 --> 00:41:03,239
hoodlums are working for how warm we are

922
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,920
oh I know I'm actually really warm right

923
00:41:03,239 --> 00:41:06,159
now for me and the cies all winter long

924
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:08,039
this one jacket it's definitely below

925
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:09,598
zero yeah and this is this jacket is I

926
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:11,159
just love it that's want to say that I'm

927
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:13,599
sorry I just got my new one too and I

928
00:41:11,159 --> 00:41:15,879
got to say I am digging it yeah they

929
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:17,680
rock all right so give that a scoop

930
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:20,200
there

931
00:41:17,679 --> 00:41:22,838
on scoopity

932
00:41:20,199 --> 00:41:24,799
dupies M fudy you know what I've noticed

933
00:41:22,838 --> 00:41:28,480
about every single of the last three

934
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:30,720
bags what they are thick

935
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:32,318
yeah this is really what you want to see

936
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:34,439
when you make bubs you know like I said

937
00:41:32,318 --> 00:41:36,800
this isn't a gigantic batch by anyone

938
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:40,559
means but we put probably less than

939
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:44,480
1,500 G of dry of wet material in so you

940
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:47,519
got to think that that's about 300 G of

941
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:49,519
dry so yeah we should get a

942
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:53,199
good you know

943
00:41:49,519 --> 00:41:55,759
20 15 to 20

944
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:56,799
G you know as the guy that makes this

945
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,480
prod though I I don't usually look at

946
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:00,440
the volume I get I look at I like the

947
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,800
quality of course it's the only interest

948
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:04,280
I have as well this but this thing I

949
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,119
hate when you're a good grower you don't

950
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:08,200
mind but the bags really show the

951
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:10,720
quality of the grower cuz how if I did a

952
00:42:08,199 --> 00:42:12,719
terrible job on my on my on my product

953
00:42:10,719 --> 00:42:14,719
it comes out right here this that's

954
00:42:12,719 --> 00:42:16,279
that's exactly grower this is our test

955
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:18,039
that's the truest truest thing you could

956
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:20,480
say you know I say it a lot but because

957
00:42:18,039 --> 00:42:22,159
I'm not a a big grower I don't think

958
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:24,920
people hear it as much but when you just

959
00:42:22,159 --> 00:42:26,838
set it there that's a very accurate

960
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:28,318
statement the bags are the of God when

961
00:42:26,838 --> 00:42:29,880
it comes to the quality of your resin

962
00:42:28,318 --> 00:42:31,358
tell you how how good a job you did and

963
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:35,079
how good your strain is how how good

964
00:42:31,358 --> 00:42:35,078
your choice is on what you're growing

965
00:42:40,039 --> 00:42:43,039
yeah

966
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:48,880
perfect okay to rinse the spoon over

967
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:50,240
here yeah rinse it out in the bucket

968
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:52,400
nice no nothing's going to dry up like

969
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:56,399
that there there's a non-rinse

970
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:58,200
spoon oh yeah exactly right so uh keep

971
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:02,400
your spoons R great idea thanks for that

972
00:42:58,199 --> 00:43:04,078
pit Mar get that 45 bag full this is one

973
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:06,440
of the bags people tend to have a bit of

974
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:09,160
a hard time with it tends to hold a

975
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:12,318
little bit more of the water but as you

976
00:43:09,159 --> 00:43:15,799
just saw me drain it in about 5

977
00:43:12,318 --> 00:43:18,960
Seconds it can be done without side

978
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:19,960
walls of mesh and without um you know

979
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:22,119
big

980
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:23,599
Loops I don't think people are draining

981
00:43:22,119 --> 00:43:25,318
their bags with a bucket you know this

982
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:26,920
is just a couple of gallons of water

983
00:43:25,318 --> 00:43:31,000
that you have to deal with with not 20

984
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:34,079
full gallons of water if you do it right

985
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:37,760
so we've always found

986
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:37,760
it oh here we

987
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:40,880
go

988
00:43:44,159 --> 00:43:49,558
okay you want to give a little spray on

989
00:43:46,639 --> 00:43:49,558
that one or

990
00:43:55,079 --> 00:43:58,880
yeah

991
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:01,599
little snowflakes coming out in the sky

992
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,599
com going in there

993
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:07,598
beautiful so this is our 45 Micron bag

994
00:44:06,239 --> 00:44:11,759
often a decent

995
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:13,838
yielder um always creamy resin uh very

996
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:16,680
oily usually the first one to catch

997
00:44:13,838 --> 00:44:19,719
flame when you're smoking

998
00:44:16,679 --> 00:44:23,719
it and uh you know for whatever reason

999
00:44:19,719 --> 00:44:25,558
it's never really a favorite yet it is a

1000
00:44:23,719 --> 00:44:28,159
sellable product it is a product that

1001
00:44:25,559 --> 00:44:30,040
you see dispensaries and such but

1002
00:44:28,159 --> 00:44:32,519
generally in the world of the head stash

1003
00:44:30,039 --> 00:44:35,838
the 45 is not the one you'd pull out to

1004
00:44:32,519 --> 00:44:38,400
brag to about with your friends still a

1005
00:44:35,838 --> 00:44:40,159
beautiful looking product that'll take a

1006
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:42,559
few seconds for the water to drain out

1007
00:44:40,159 --> 00:44:43,920
just because it is the tighter bag you

1008
00:44:42,559 --> 00:44:45,280
can kind of give it a little bit of a

1009
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:47,119
shake yeah a little shake shake shake

1010
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:49,079
shake shake shake little shimmy you know

1011
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:50,880
just to move that water to a new area

1012
00:44:49,079 --> 00:44:53,000
because it's making a dam where the

1013
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:55,119
house is so thick in there the water

1014
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,880
can't get through it the 25 and the 45

1015
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:59,838
always do that so you got to help the

1016
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:01,960
water move around away from the down yep

1017
00:44:59,838 --> 00:45:03,960
so if you want to give that a

1018
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:06,199
shot if you want to pull that out with

1019
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:09,039
the spoon there

1020
00:45:06,199 --> 00:45:11,759
yeah I think it's good now you ready to

1021
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:11,759
go there

1022
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:18,000
yeah look at that that's

1023
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:19,720
thick yeah that looks very thick all

1024
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,519
bubbles thick

1025
00:45:19,719 --> 00:45:23,318
but now you mentioned the different

1026
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:25,440
screens is it not have I not heard you

1027
00:45:23,318 --> 00:45:27,358
in the past say that different types of

1028
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:29,240
pot give different yields and different

1029
00:45:27,358 --> 00:45:31,358
screens absolutely but you know what it

1030
00:45:29,239 --> 00:45:32,959
is an extreme thing for the majority of

1031
00:45:31,358 --> 00:45:35,719
the part if you're growing

1032
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:37,880
indoor you're going to see most things

1033
00:45:35,719 --> 00:45:41,519
in between the 120 and the

1034
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:44,280
45 what I've noticed is tropical grown

1035
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:47,239
outdoor sativas that are pure

1036
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:49,280
sativas their heads are extremely small

1037
00:45:47,239 --> 00:45:52,318
and you'll usually get the nicest ones

1038
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:53,880
and the most out of the 25 and the 45

1039
00:45:52,318 --> 00:45:56,480
okay but that's a tropical grown like

1040
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:58,000
Australian 20 weeks sativa

1041
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:01,480
I haven't seen that as much with

1042
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:04,639
hybridized sativas that are grown

1043
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:07,199
indoors oh beautiful piles here that

1044
00:46:04,639 --> 00:46:10,799
we've pulled out for our little day of

1045
00:46:07,199 --> 00:46:10,799
bubble making before I jump on a

1046
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:21,000
plane good job good

1047
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:28,439
job I guess we'll just pull this one out

1048
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:30,280
and rinse it in the uh 25 y spoon first

1049
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:32,358
very tight the spoon in the bag can be

1050
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:35,920
done simultaneously I find when I'm

1051
00:46:32,358 --> 00:46:38,000
doing the process it's just quick I

1052
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:40,159
usually do my bag and my spoon literally

1053
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:44,400
at the same time and then we can just

1054
00:46:40,159 --> 00:46:44,399
pull this out yeah there we

1055
00:46:48,159 --> 00:46:52,879
go this is a very important process of

1056
00:46:50,679 --> 00:46:54,558
saving your resin glands and you want to

1057
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:56,039
be careful when you do it yeah don't hit

1058
00:46:54,559 --> 00:46:57,680
sides you don't want to hit the sides

1059
00:46:56,039 --> 00:47:00,079
what I would have done is I would have

1060
00:46:57,679 --> 00:47:02,118
squeezed the whole screen in my hand

1061
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:04,039
from the bottom and when I lifted It Up

1062
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:06,240
Inside Out the whole entire screen all

1063
00:47:04,039 --> 00:47:07,920
the resin would be crumpled in my hand

1064
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:10,598
and then I would you know push it into

1065
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:11,920
the water that way and that way it uh

1066
00:47:10,599 --> 00:47:13,480
just ensures that you're not going to

1067
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:14,960
push those resin glands onto the sides

1068
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:17,519
of the bags and that you're going to

1069
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:19,519
clean them off now that is tarpine Rich

1070
00:47:17,519 --> 00:47:21,440
water with 25 micron heads floating

1071
00:47:19,519 --> 00:47:24,599
around so you do still want to take it

1072
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:26,240
the bag and rinse it with uh your your

1073
00:47:24,599 --> 00:47:28,480
your clean water out of the

1074
00:47:26,239 --> 00:47:33,439
H and we're pretty blessed to be doing

1075
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:33,440
this today in a really nice snowy

1076
00:47:34,519 --> 00:47:40,639
environment it's actually snowing right

1077
00:47:36,719 --> 00:47:40,639
now it is a beautiful snowflake very

1078
00:47:43,239 --> 00:47:47,879
light

1079
00:47:46,199 --> 00:47:50,279
perfect hey you want me to hang the

1080
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:52,440
yellow one yeah right over here yeah you

1081
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:54,480
got it yeah you a lot of times in the

1082
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:56,880
summertime when I'm doing this these

1083
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:59,039
bags will all be on the on the on the

1084
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:00,318
line yes I love when they're on the line

1085
00:47:59,039 --> 00:48:01,480
and when the planes come over I think

1086
00:48:00,318 --> 00:48:04,599
they must see all these different colors

1087
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:04,599
think I'm some kind of quite a

1088
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:21,000
show good video this going to be a great

1089
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:22,880
video okay finally the 25 micron bag the

1090
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,838
bag that gives people the most problem

1091
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:27,400
the bag that people say I don't even use

1092
00:48:24,838 --> 00:48:29,920
that bag it's so difficult and hard this

1093
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:32,318
bag can pay for all your bags if you've

1094
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:34,440
got a four bag kit this bag can pay for

1095
00:48:32,318 --> 00:48:37,199
them and buy you four more bags this is

1096
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:39,119
a worthwhile bag to keep even if you're

1097
00:48:37,199 --> 00:48:41,279
using it for medibles whatever the

1098
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:43,519
purpose is it's always worth keeping so

1099
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:46,680
I'll show you I can do it I want to show

1100
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:46,679
them the quick quick

1101
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:51,240
release and you make these bags good

1102
00:48:49,199 --> 00:48:52,719
enough they won't bust oh exactly and

1103
00:48:51,239 --> 00:48:57,598
this isn't like hundreds of pounds of

1104
00:48:52,719 --> 00:48:57,598
water I'm not uh Superman by any means

1105
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:04,400
you know and if you're if you're in a

1106
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:07,400
situation where you can't lift this bag

1107
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:09,160
I always suggest get someone to help you

1108
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:11,680
it's worth

1109
00:49:09,159 --> 00:49:13,679
having it's a worth worthwhile bag

1110
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:15,759
having and now you see the water is

1111
00:49:13,679 --> 00:49:17,879
released we could have built a little

1112
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:20,119
cage a small little cage around the

1113
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:22,720
bottom inside of this and that would

1114
00:49:20,119 --> 00:49:24,160
have kept the bag from sealing around it

1115
00:49:22,719 --> 00:49:26,318
and it's it would have released more

1116
00:49:24,159 --> 00:49:29,558
water but this is this is makes shifting

1117
00:49:26,318 --> 00:49:29,558
quick and good so we're not

1118
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:38,079
complaining 25 micron is about the only

1119
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:40,400
bag I do that to I'll give it a little

1120
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:41,200
bit of a squeeze get some of that excess

1121
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,880
water

1122
00:49:41,199 --> 00:49:45,078
out

1123
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:47,240
um yeah you hear a lot of funny things

1124
00:49:45,079 --> 00:49:50,000
that people say online about damaging

1125
00:49:47,239 --> 00:49:53,039
the glands and this that and the other

1126
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:55,760
but let's not use the water right away

1127
00:49:53,039 --> 00:49:59,000
let's use a spoon the 25 micron is so so

1128
00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:01,359
slow to drain and it's so easy to clean

1129
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:03,559
for whatever reason these small heads

1130
00:50:01,358 --> 00:50:05,400
you see how they clean off the bag yeah

1131
00:50:03,559 --> 00:50:08,200
like nicer than you see how clean that

1132
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:11,039
is almost like the hose did it oh yeah

1133
00:50:08,199 --> 00:50:13,558
yeah yeah and so if we put too much

1134
00:50:11,039 --> 00:50:15,199
water into here what'll happen is it'll

1135
00:50:13,559 --> 00:50:18,880
just never drain and we'll need a

1136
00:50:15,199 --> 00:50:21,639
pressing screen the size of this bag to

1137
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:24,798
um to to fit the hash on to even right

1138
00:50:21,639 --> 00:50:26,279
now it's bubbled up and I'd say most of

1139
00:50:24,798 --> 00:50:29,280
what is there right

1140
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:29,280
now

1141
00:50:31,239 --> 00:50:39,199
is is uh bubbles here we'll show

1142
00:50:35,719 --> 00:50:41,879
you so there's a pile of 25

1143
00:50:39,199 --> 00:50:44,118
micron and you can see the bubbles

1144
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:45,960
popping um probably not even a bad idea

1145
00:50:44,119 --> 00:50:48,119
to leave this for a few

1146
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:51,960
minutes um what we're going to do now is

1147
00:50:48,119 --> 00:50:53,838
we're going to take this we'll place

1148
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:57,920
this over top of

1149
00:50:53,838 --> 00:51:00,838
this we'll get some paper towel or a a a

1150
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:03,159
cloth we'll put it under and on top of

1151
00:51:00,838 --> 00:51:04,599
this and we'll gently press some of the

1152
00:51:03,159 --> 00:51:08,279
water out we're going to be doing a

1153
00:51:04,599 --> 00:51:09,960
strainer process today um Ron's got the

1154
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:12,040
strainer stainless steel strainer little

1155
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:13,720
guy and I'll push this through and put

1156
00:51:12,039 --> 00:51:16,159
it out on cardboard as quick and

1157
00:51:13,719 --> 00:51:17,519
efficiently as I can um because we're

1158
00:51:16,159 --> 00:51:19,039
doing that we don't want to leave this

1159
00:51:17,519 --> 00:51:22,280
bubble to sit too long because we're

1160
00:51:19,039 --> 00:51:23,798
outside we have an advantage um it is

1161
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:25,960
kind of like being in the fridge or

1162
00:51:23,798 --> 00:51:28,440
whatever but um at the the same time you

1163
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:30,400
don't want to you know let it sit for

1164
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:31,880
too long before you strain in particular

1165
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:33,400
it's you can leave it sit as long as you

1166
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:35,200
want if you're going to microplane but

1167
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:36,680
straining is a different story this

1168
00:51:35,199 --> 00:51:38,798
stuff will self press and you won't be

1169
00:51:36,679 --> 00:51:40,359
able to push it through a strainer so

1170
00:51:38,798 --> 00:51:43,498
we'll get to that

1171
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:43,499
[Applause]

1172
00:51:46,318 --> 00:51:52,639
next all right so we've got our resin

1173
00:51:50,199 --> 00:51:54,558
here our 25 micron is still sitting out

1174
00:51:52,639 --> 00:51:56,639
in the bag which is fine it's uh out in

1175
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:59,280
the cold weather we've got the towel

1176
00:51:56,639 --> 00:52:02,318
underneath and we've got the towel over

1177
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:05,599
top we've got our strainers a little one

1178
00:52:02,318 --> 00:52:07,798
and a big one and a variety of spoons

1179
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:10,920
that we'll be able to use inside the

1180
00:52:07,798 --> 00:52:14,960
strainer to allow it to to fall properly

1181
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:17,318
so I've also got um this is helpful

1182
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:21,760
cardboard with all the numbers written

1183
00:52:17,318 --> 00:52:23,519
on it already 160 120 90 73 and 45 and I

1184
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:25,920
have uh some other cardboards here as

1185
00:52:23,519 --> 00:52:27,280
well with more numbers on them so

1186
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:29,318
it's pretty important even though you

1187
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:31,079
might think you know what's going on to

1188
00:52:29,318 --> 00:52:32,838
mark down the resins like I was saying

1189
00:52:31,079 --> 00:52:35,240
to Ron earlier when he had put the the

1190
00:52:32,838 --> 00:52:37,599
220 right in the middle if we had all of

1191
00:52:35,239 --> 00:52:38,919
these you know sure an expert hash maker

1192
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:40,798
should pretty much be able I could tell

1193
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:42,960
you which one the 45 is the 73 and the

1194
00:52:40,798 --> 00:52:45,039
90 would be pretty easy to hone in it

1195
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:48,000
wouldn't be impossible but let's just be

1196
00:52:45,039 --> 00:52:49,920
organized and and do this the proper way

1197
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,440
so we're going to do straining today

1198
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:53,358
we're not going to do microplaning

1199
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:55,240
microplaning is a process where I freeze

1200
00:52:53,358 --> 00:52:57,239
these after removing a lot of the moist

1201
00:52:55,239 --> 00:52:59,838
moisture either letting it Wick just

1202
00:52:57,239 --> 00:53:01,399
like this freeze them and then microplan

1203
00:52:59,838 --> 00:53:04,798
them over the cardboard we're going to

1204
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:06,519
do stainless uh strainer today and I'm

1205
00:53:04,798 --> 00:53:07,920
going to just clean this out a tiny bit

1206
00:53:06,519 --> 00:53:10,519
cuz it's still dirty from the last time

1207
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:13,240
I used it giving it a little whack like

1208
00:53:10,519 --> 00:53:15,318
that will literally clean 95% of the

1209
00:53:13,239 --> 00:53:18,000
resin out of it that's why I like the

1210
00:53:15,318 --> 00:53:19,719
strainers it's nice like that so this is

1211
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,519
pretty high quality resin you kind of

1212
00:53:19,719 --> 00:53:23,480
have to know with straining how what

1213
00:53:21,519 --> 00:53:24,719
quality the resin you're working with if

1214
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:27,039
you're working with an extremely high

1215
00:53:24,719 --> 00:53:29,000
quality res and you press down really

1216
00:53:27,039 --> 00:53:30,199
hard it's bonded you're never going to

1217
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,239
push it through a strainer you might as

1218
00:53:30,199 --> 00:53:34,679
well throw that stuff in the uh in the

1219
00:53:32,239 --> 00:53:37,159
freezer and microplan it so I'm going to

1220
00:53:34,679 --> 00:53:39,399
be um pretty gentle you can see there

1221
00:53:37,159 --> 00:53:43,879
these patties here have now dried out a

1222
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:45,639
tiny bit pretty much for straining I

1223
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:46,880
don't want them to be much drier than

1224
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:49,118
that I know the quality of this

1225
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:51,519
watermelon I know the quality of subcool

1226
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:53,920
and his strains the TGA crew they don't

1227
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:55,880
mess around um those guys produce full

1228
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:59,760
melt genetics you know know certified by

1229
00:53:55,880 --> 00:54:02,200
me the bubble man um yeah so let's let's

1230
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:04,200
do this we've got our strains here I can

1231
00:54:02,199 --> 00:54:10,879
kind of lift it up a little bit for you

1232
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:14,558
220 190 160 120 90 73 and 45 so we're

1233
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:17,240
going to take these for starters now the

1234
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:19,240
220 it's it's nothing it's not even a

1235
00:54:17,239 --> 00:54:21,919
product so I mean literally I'll just

1236
00:54:19,239 --> 00:54:23,519
put it up here in the corner of the 160

1237
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:25,400
I I won't push that through the strainer

1238
00:54:23,519 --> 00:54:28,039
I don't want that on the strainer

1239
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:31,798
contaminating my uh my final product and

1240
00:54:28,039 --> 00:54:33,880
nor do I want uh the 190 uh they'll both

1241
00:54:31,798 --> 00:54:35,719
be cooked into metaal most likely so

1242
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:38,280
those can just sit right there on top of

1243
00:54:35,719 --> 00:54:40,558
the screen or on top of the cardboard

1244
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:44,000
this is the first one I'll actually do

1245
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:46,559
and I suggest when you do this that you

1246
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:50,119
use a separate strainer for your lower

1247
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:53,519
grades as opposed to your higher

1248
00:54:50,119 --> 00:54:56,119
grade so clean that out we're going to

1249
00:54:53,519 --> 00:54:59,719
take our 160 now place it in our

1250
00:54:56,119 --> 00:55:03,039
stainless strain strainer and literally

1251
00:54:59,719 --> 00:55:04,679
just grind it through you know not

1252
00:55:03,039 --> 00:55:06,759
grinding it harsh but just nice and

1253
00:55:04,679 --> 00:55:07,519
gently and you can can see it just Falls

1254
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:10,680
as

1255
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:12,719
powder and uh I'll get Ron to do a few

1256
00:55:10,679 --> 00:55:14,480
of these later and I'll actually film it

1257
00:55:12,719 --> 00:55:18,798
closer so you can see what I'm talking

1258
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:20,760
about of allowing it to spread thin and

1259
00:55:18,798 --> 00:55:23,318
so as you get to the end when you think

1260
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:26,079
that you just have all this hash stuck

1261
00:55:23,318 --> 00:55:27,759
in your strainer you just come over to

1262
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:30,470
the other side and kind of give it a

1263
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:32,160
little shave and give it a little

1264
00:55:30,469 --> 00:55:34,439
[Music]

1265
00:55:32,159 --> 00:55:37,920
whack and everything comes off of your

1266
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:39,760
strainer so there's our 160 done our 220

1267
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:41,079
and our 190 are sitting there undone I'm

1268
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:43,280
going to take this strainer and this

1269
00:55:41,079 --> 00:55:45,200
spoon and put it over here because it

1270
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:46,839
has a lower quality resin and because we

1271
00:55:45,199 --> 00:55:48,399
want to be obsessive about this let's

1272
00:55:46,838 --> 00:55:50,558
think about it we grew this cannabis for

1273
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:53,280
3 months we made variables of choosing

1274
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:54,720
phenotypes growing it under extreme

1275
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:56,559
conditions from controlling everything

1276
00:55:54,719 --> 00:55:58,318
in doors to trying to control bugs and

1277
00:55:56,559 --> 00:56:00,079
powdery Milos maybe you're in a

1278
00:55:58,318 --> 00:56:01,558
greenhouse and you need to add extra

1279
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:03,760
light because it's not sunny enough and

1280
00:56:01,559 --> 00:56:05,480
you need to there's so many variables

1281
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:07,240
that happen along the lines and then you

1282
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:09,119
get to the point where you trim it and

1283
00:56:07,239 --> 00:56:10,558
that's a variable and how you maintain

1284
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:12,280
the trim and what you do with the trim

1285
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:14,319
and taking the trim and finally washing

1286
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:16,760
it not leaving it in the water too long

1287
00:56:14,318 --> 00:56:19,000
doing all the steps properly getting to

1288
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:21,760
this point this to me in my opinion is

1289
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:24,719
the only thing the water hash maker is

1290
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:27,000
doing right the ice mixing is popcorn

1291
00:56:24,719 --> 00:56:28,719
and anyone can do it it's it's it's

1292
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,559
water and ice is doing the whole job for

1293
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:32,598
you so please don't take credit for that

1294
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:34,880
the grower has grown great resin for you

1295
00:56:32,599 --> 00:56:37,760
so please don't take credit for that

1296
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:39,838
what you can take credit for is doing

1297
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:43,280
this properly doing this process

1298
00:56:39,838 --> 00:56:45,358
properly is extremely important and uh

1299
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:49,519
you'll be rewarded when you do so this

1300
00:56:45,358 --> 00:56:53,759
120 that we have is huge so I think I'm

1301
00:56:49,519 --> 00:56:57,239
going to put it on the 120 and the 45

1302
00:56:53,760 --> 00:57:00,119
it's a very big piece piece of of uh of

1303
00:56:57,239 --> 00:57:02,479
120 so we'll get that right into the

1304
00:57:00,119 --> 00:57:02,480
into the

1305
00:57:02,599 --> 00:57:08,680
strainer you can just put it all at once

1306
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:10,920
nice little pile there and then

1307
00:57:08,679 --> 00:57:13,598
we'll want to move this out of the way a

1308
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:16,358
little bit cuz actually I think yeah I'm

1309
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:18,599
going to go 120 I might even do 120 45

1310
00:57:16,358 --> 00:57:22,598
and 73 this is so big I might do the

1311
00:57:18,599 --> 00:57:24,079
whole and you can see how it comes out

1312
00:57:22,599 --> 00:57:26,119
you want it to spread thin you don't

1313
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:27,920
want it to be get and all thick and

1314
00:57:26,119 --> 00:57:30,000
that's why you need a lot of space for

1315
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:32,440
the cardboard a lot of people do this

1316
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:34,358
wrong they Clump it all up this hash

1317
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:35,519
needs surface area once it has the

1318
00:57:34,358 --> 00:57:37,719
proper surface

1319
00:57:35,519 --> 00:57:39,480
area the cardboard is going to do its

1320
00:57:37,719 --> 00:57:40,679
job which is to Wick the moisture out of

1321
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:43,440
the

1322
00:57:40,679 --> 00:57:46,358
hash very important process it's why so

1323
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:48,720
many people that are that turned off a

1324
00:57:46,358 --> 00:57:52,400
water hash because a it was never dried

1325
00:57:48,719 --> 00:57:54,239
properly or B it was you know made

1326
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:56,880
incorrectly little things little

1327
00:57:54,239 --> 00:58:00,159
variables like um not leaving it in the

1328
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:01,798
water for an hour so the card filled up

1329
00:58:00,159 --> 00:58:04,440
there I'm not sure where I got caught up

1330
00:58:01,798 --> 00:58:08,038
I was tapping the 120 Micron we've now

1331
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:10,798
moved into the um 90 Micron beautiful

1332
00:58:08,039 --> 00:58:13,599
beautiful nice fatty little Patty of

1333
00:58:10,798 --> 00:58:16,519
just absolute blonde goodness we're

1334
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:19,119
going to get that out on the 90 here the

1335
00:58:16,519 --> 00:58:22,400
strainer just works so good I got to say

1336
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:25,240
like I prefer this over uh the

1337
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:27,200
microplaning every every time it's just

1338
00:58:25,239 --> 00:58:29,118
so easy you've watched the videos of the

1339
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:31,838
microplaning and the grinding of it it's

1340
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:33,559
just I mean I don't do it a ton so I'm

1341
00:58:31,838 --> 00:58:36,400
not pretending to be the the you know

1342
00:58:33,559 --> 00:58:39,798
the expert micr planer but I definitely

1343
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:42,160
definitely prefer

1344
00:58:39,798 --> 00:58:44,719
this that's just clean and easy I don't

1345
00:58:42,159 --> 00:58:47,199
have a drop of resin on my fingers I get

1346
00:58:44,719 --> 00:58:49,118
all the resin off of the

1347
00:58:47,199 --> 00:58:51,798
um off the

1348
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:53,280
strainer even though you can see the

1349
00:58:51,798 --> 00:58:55,559
there is a little bit of a buildup there

1350
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:58,880
from someone not cleaning it you can get

1351
00:58:55,559 --> 00:59:00,839
it all off if you require it okay so get

1352
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:04,920
over to this 70 Micron

1353
00:59:00,838 --> 00:59:08,159
here 70 can go right into that same one

1354
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:08,159
and we'll see what we got for

1355
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:16,760
70 all right I managed to save some room

1356
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:16,760
on

1357
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:24,400
that so we'll be able to do our

1358
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:25,880
45 and still make room for it because

1359
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:28,760
I'm not sure if you guys remember at the

1360
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:31,720
video there I actually put the

1361
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:34,240
120 on the 45 and that's important that

1362
00:59:31,719 --> 00:59:37,558
I Mark that down that these two are 120s

1363
00:59:34,239 --> 00:59:40,038
now and as well that I mark this

1364
00:59:37,559 --> 00:59:42,039
down that uh I don't know if there's a

1365
00:59:40,039 --> 00:59:44,640
pen around but I'll make sure that I do

1366
00:59:42,039 --> 00:59:48,200
that because I don't want my resins all

1367
00:59:44,639 --> 00:59:51,000
mixed up once again 45 I could guarantee

1368
00:59:48,199 --> 00:59:53,239
tell I can always tell when it's the 45

1369
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:55,239
it has a very particular taste almost

1370
00:59:53,239 --> 00:59:58,078
regardless of the strain

1371
00:59:55,239 --> 00:59:58,078
it's always very

1372
01:00:01,719 --> 01:00:08,358
oily all right so there we have

1373
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:09,680
it you can see that it's really not as

1374
01:00:08,358 --> 01:00:11,880
difficult as some people might make it

1375
01:00:09,679 --> 01:00:16,239
out to be you've got

1376
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:18,480
your cardboard resin 160 120 90 73 and

1377
01:00:16,239 --> 01:00:19,719
45 all beautifully spread all right just

1378
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:21,798
wanted to show you guys we didn't forget

1379
01:00:19,719 --> 01:00:23,759
about the 25 micron although we did put

1380
01:00:21,798 --> 01:00:27,519
it at the 90 we'll have to change that

1381
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:29,760
here's the 25 Micron out on the screen

1382
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:31,880
getting ready to drve this is um easy to

1383
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:33,400
move in my opinion cardboards light I

1384
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:35,079
can go now and put it in the room where

1385
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:37,400
it's going to be drying and it's just

1386
01:00:35,079 --> 01:00:39,400
going to stay away from dust debris hair

1387
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:42,680
everything um we'll probably take one of

1388
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:45,639
the one uh 100 Micron screens the four

1389
01:00:42,679 --> 01:00:47,598
the framed 2x4 ft frames I have and

1390
01:00:45,639 --> 01:00:50,239
we'll flip it over top of this so

1391
01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:53,280
nothing can fall on top all right so

1392
01:00:50,239 --> 01:00:55,639
here we have some of our dry sift

1393
01:00:53,280 --> 01:01:00,519
cleaning that's just that I cleaned

1394
01:00:55,639 --> 01:01:02,239
out now under here we have our bubble

1395
01:01:00,519 --> 01:01:04,639
just sitting out on cardboard it's you

1396
01:01:02,239 --> 01:01:09,000
know sometimes I would have it more

1397
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:11,000
enclosed in um like I like to put it in

1398
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:14,440
pizza boxes and have them closed this is

1399
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:16,960
fine no one comes in this room um I'll

1400
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:19,798
probably even seal this up like that

1401
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:22,039
just a little bit more cover so the hash

1402
01:01:19,798 --> 01:01:23,639
isn't exposed this dry sift I don't care

1403
01:01:22,039 --> 01:01:26,520
about it's talcum powder it's stuff I've

1404
01:01:23,639 --> 01:01:28,920
already cleaned out the heads from and

1405
01:01:26,519 --> 01:01:33,318
uh so yeah I'd say we got a good 15 to

1406
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:35,760
20 G here and I'll be back to show you

1407
01:01:33,318 --> 01:01:37,838
that when it dries I got to go get on a

1408
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:39,760
plane right now so hopefully Ron comes

1409
01:01:37,838 --> 01:01:43,798
and sees me soon otherwise we'll have to

1410
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:47,400
photograph this when I come back CIA for

1411
01:01:43,798 --> 01:01:49,159
now so um I think that's pretty much it

1412
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:51,480
we'll catch up with you guys later when

1413
01:01:49,159 --> 01:01:53,558
this is all dried I'll end up getting

1414
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:55,599
macro photographs of it and melt shots

1415
01:01:53,559 --> 01:01:57,880
but for now I just want to give a huge

1416
01:01:55,599 --> 01:01:59,160
thanks to Ron for having us out here I

1417
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:01,720
want to get the picture just to say this

1418
01:01:59,159 --> 01:02:03,480
you guys if Mark was seems at all fast

1419
01:02:01,719 --> 01:02:05,439
what he's doing he's on a plane in the

1420
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:07,760
next 10 minutes we got to get him on icy

1421
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:09,720
roads into the airport and on a plane so

1422
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:12,119

1445
01:03:18,199 --> 01:03:24,358
the dry sift it's when it's pure heads

1446
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:25,480
it's a clump even in powder form really

1447

Dil that's on the

1458
01:03:51,579 --> 01:03:56,239
[Music]

1459
01:03:53,278 --> 01:03:59,760
Mothership

1460
01:03:56,239 --> 01:03:59,759

1467
01:04:22,798 --> 01:04:26,199
just putting the carb cap on

01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:32,599
yeah look at that

1469
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:33,960
boom can't say enough about the carb cap

1470
01:04:32,599 --> 01:04:36,278
although I have to say that I think

1471
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:37,920
glass blowers should probably start

1472
01:04:36,278 --> 01:04:39,559
designing little things like this

1473
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:42,278
because I know this is a k9 tube and

1474
01:04:39,559 --> 01:04:45,079
it's you know $100 plus dollars but I'll

1475
01:04:42,278 --> 01:04:47,318
tell you it makes a great carb cap

1476
01:04:45,079 --> 01:04:48,480
really increases the hit saves saves a

1477

1478
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:53,318
