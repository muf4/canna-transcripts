26
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:10,140
the Teflon which is the cherry pie

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:15,000

31
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:24,240

we've got a few pieces if we want to do

33
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:30,328

34
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:32,489
almost 418 so I would say we have two

35
00:01:30,328 --> 00:01:36,929
minutes to get your dabs ready for the

36
