00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:24,778
hey guys welcome to bubble man's world

3
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:28,589
I'm here with Dee 420k and we are about

4
00:00:24,778 --> 00:00:29,579
to do the Blue River extracts terpene

5
00:00:28,589 --> 00:00:32,098
gauntlet

6
00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:35,219
I have 18 incredible flavors that I've

7
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:38,039
had sent over from mr. VIRs aura Tony

8
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:40,410
from from Blue River and you know just

9
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:45,719
to kind of go through them real quick

10
00:00:40,409 --> 00:00:49,199
we've got lemon Kush we've got orange

11
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:54,899
creamsicle we've got purple punch

12
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:58,500
we've got sunset KB we've got pineapple

13
00:00:54,899 --> 00:01:06,859
cream sickle or pineapple cream and then

14
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:06,859
we have Tahoe og triple og a gooey

15
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:20,180
gorilla glue vitamin C B D cheese bomb

16
00:01:15,259 --> 00:01:23,040
red congolese oh my god let me tell you

17
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:24,810
is that a cross with something no that's

18
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,270
a congolese there's a green Congo and a

19
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:28,560
red Congo they're separate they're

20
00:01:27,269 --> 00:01:36,840
different

21
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:39,090
chem dog venom OG smw which is the

22
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:42,240
strawberry Mindwarp

23
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:46,680
and finally but not lat you know last

24
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:50,188
but not least we got the cherry ak-47 so

25
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:54,149
this is what we've done we have taken a

26
00:01:50,188 --> 00:01:56,398
drop out of each one and placed it into

27
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:58,439
oh sorry I forgot the purple Hindu as

28
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,329
well which is the one here at the end

29
00:01:58,438 --> 00:02:02,519
that doesn't actually have the small jar

30
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:04,859
because I only got large jars of purple

31
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:07,170
Hindu so I pulled out a couple of drops

32
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:10,288
and put it in here so each empty jar

33
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:11,289
without the label has maybe a drop or

34
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:14,259
two maximum

35
00:02:11,289 --> 00:02:16,718
in it and that way we can dip each hit

36
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:19,358
into the turf jar without actually

37
00:02:16,718 --> 00:02:22,358
affecting the original turf job but may

38
00:02:19,359 --> 00:02:24,579
be contaminated with your rose 100 same

39
00:02:22,359 --> 00:02:26,349
time these terpenes are these terpenes

40
00:02:24,579 --> 00:02:28,450
are solvents they would chew up our

41
00:02:26,348 --> 00:02:29,590
roses and that's a good good call you

42
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:32,139
want to tell everyone what you're using

43
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:35,620
as your base for today well I've got 120

44
00:02:32,139 --> 00:02:40,289
dry seft OG Kush it's really thick and

45
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:45,670
it's dark but very powerful

46
00:02:40,289 --> 00:02:47,650
nice cast and it's um it's good it's

47
00:02:45,669 --> 00:02:49,388
really good I love it it's it's what I

48
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:51,370
brought to smoke as the base flavor

49
00:02:49,389 --> 00:02:54,010
tartare with so I'm not getting any

50
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:55,629
contaminate across I think it's a good

51
00:02:54,009 --> 00:02:57,518
idea we both talked about it earlier

52
00:02:55,628 --> 00:02:59,888
before filming that it would be best if

53
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:02,349
we hit each rip with the same product

54
00:02:59,889 --> 00:03:05,650
and just go all the way through I'm

55
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:09,459
using some of the West Coast concentrate

56
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:12,129
rosin this one is it's a purple purple

57
00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:14,500
candy Kirra believe not not with

58
00:03:12,128 --> 00:03:16,478
anything else mixed in so yeah I'm

59
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:19,900
pretty excited to do should we should we

60
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:21,099
start the gauntlet yes 18 ribs we're

61
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,709
gonna try and do it in under an hour

62
00:03:21,098 --> 00:03:26,018
that means every minute and 30 seconds

63
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:28,989
either Darren or myself has to be taking

64
00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:32,680
a rib every three minutes we each have

65
00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:34,689
to take one new rib to get to get under

66
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:37,810
the 1 hour mark so I'm pretty stoked I

67
00:03:34,689 --> 00:03:43,810
guess we'll go let's go purple hit you

68
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:46,598
oh good very excited about this little

69
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:49,239
and we're also doing just little ribs I

70
00:03:46,598 --> 00:03:51,969
think that's a good thing to to explain

71
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:54,128
to everyone we are not doing you know

72
00:03:51,969 --> 00:03:55,959
what we would normally hit 18 of those

73
00:03:54,128 --> 00:03:57,818
ribs in a row this is really all about

74
00:03:55,959 --> 00:04:01,539
the terpenes and the cannabinoids are

75
00:03:57,818 --> 00:04:02,589
mostly in this situation the carrier for

76
00:04:01,539 --> 00:04:04,628
the terpenes because we don't really

77
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:06,069
want to hit pure terpenes I find hitting

78
00:04:04,628 --> 00:04:10,959
them with the cannabinoids to just be

79
00:04:06,068 --> 00:04:14,008
the perfect perfect rip um one thing

80
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:16,598
that I've known that I've this is all

81
00:04:14,008 --> 00:04:19,000
every one of these strains is turps all

82
00:04:16,598 --> 00:04:21,310
from the marijuana strain that

83
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,069
they are all cannabis derived there's no

84
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:25,509
other things involved here huge thing I

85
00:04:24,069 --> 00:04:27,519
wanted to point though because there's

86
00:04:25,509 --> 00:04:29,920
all kinds of creamsicle and stuff like

87
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:33,370
though yeah but they're not Terps from

88
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:35,770
the strains their profile is created to

89
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:37,449
taste like that and the actual kind of

90
00:04:35,769 --> 00:04:39,279
cannabis Turkey and you know marks tell

91
00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:41,920
don't our PhD chemist and hash Church

92
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:43,449
says terpenes or terpenes I tend to be a

93
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,949
little disagreement with that when it

94
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:47,620
comes to the inhalation of these

95
00:04:44,949 --> 00:04:50,259
potentially caustic potentially solvent

96
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:51,699
based terpenes I want to make sure that

97
00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:53,199
they're coming from cannabis the plant

98
00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:54,849
that produces them that we have been

99
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:58,839
inhaling them off of for thousands of

100
00:04:54,850 --> 00:05:01,030
years and I just prefer a cannabis

101
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:01,959
derived keep in mind we're also smoking

102
00:05:01,029 --> 00:05:04,179
a profile

103
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:07,120
we're not puffing any pure terpenes here

104
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:09,550
these are pure cannabis terpene profile

105
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:13,689
so it's a variety of terpenes that we're

106
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:15,910
hitting so I guess we start we start my

107
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:16,418
friend let's very that's Cheers yeah

108
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:22,480
dude

109
00:05:16,418 --> 00:05:24,310
cheers cheers Cheers

110
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:26,470
it was the nail Cheers I liked it I've

111
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:28,680
only done it one at a time but it was

112
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:28,680
good

113
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:55,850
well it's also nice to use a base that

114
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:58,910
you're so used to because you recognize

115
00:05:55,850 --> 00:06:01,460
the differences in the flavors what do

116
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:03,680
you have to say about that I have to say

117
00:06:01,459 --> 00:06:06,349
that the temperature makes a huge

118
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,269
difference we should mention that we are

119
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:10,160
both hitting under 600 degrees

120
00:06:08,269 --> 00:06:12,829
Fahrenheit we're at about five hundred

121
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,930
and seventy eight to five hundred and

122
00:06:12,829 --> 00:06:17,839
eighty or five hundred seventy seven to

123
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:20,538
five hundred and eighty and the lower

124
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:21,739
temperature with the Terps always seems

125
00:06:20,538 --> 00:06:23,449
to make it a little better you'll get a

126
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:25,759
lighter hit in the sense you'll get this

127
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:27,740
smoke off on the map nodes but the

128
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:30,199
terpene rip that you get from that low

129
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:31,699
low temp dab we're not quite as low as

130
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:35,180
some people some people go under five

131
00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:37,160
hundred degrees oh yeah west coast boys

132
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:40,819
they like that one guy likes it really

133
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:43,430
low yeah yeah low temp dabbers yeah so

134
00:06:40,819 --> 00:06:45,680
what do you say about lemon cush very

135
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:47,598
very nice that you could taste the

136
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,370
citrusy in it well that was purple no

137
00:06:47,598 --> 00:06:51,348
that was purple Hindu this is lemon cush

138
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:58,340
that's what I meant by what do you think

139
00:06:51,348 --> 00:07:01,639
of this one no oh right like it's just

140
00:06:58,339 --> 00:07:05,659
come on if I could have you know one of

141
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:11,750
those sleep apnea machines at night and

142
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:14,960
have that pump into my face that's

143
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:17,180
awesome would be perfect I am very very

144
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:19,489
modulated off of the first hit I have to

145
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:20,990
admit like it's such an amazing great

146
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:24,530
feeling you could go and enjoy yourself

147
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:26,329
for an hour on this vibe whereas we're

148
00:07:24,529 --> 00:07:27,829
just gonna of course shatter it with the

149
00:07:26,329 --> 00:07:30,740
small yeah

150
00:07:27,829 --> 00:07:32,689
the flavor lick your lips it'll be on

151
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:35,449
there really nice here we go

152
00:07:32,689 --> 00:07:37,598
lemon Kush purple Hindu was beautiful by

153
00:07:35,449 --> 00:07:37,598
the way

154
00:07:46,459 --> 00:07:53,659
oh wow now there's a there's much more

155
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:56,659
going on in the lemon cush in the old

156
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:58,490
way in its levels there are levels going

157
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:00,439
on there I don't even want to exhale but

158
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:01,879
I want to keep it but did you notice

159
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:03,350
that the taste on your lips versus the

160
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:04,850
taste in your mouth versus the taste in

161
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:07,040
your throat they're all slightly

162
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:10,420
different the way it fractions the

163
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:13,939
flavors right now it's all on my lips

164
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:15,770
it's it's all in my head it's hard to

165
00:08:13,939 --> 00:08:19,519
describe though isn't it so it's slaver

166
00:08:15,769 --> 00:08:21,259
wise it's um I mean I'm thinking kind of

167
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:23,569
like that silly as it sounds it's a

168
00:08:21,259 --> 00:08:27,949
party in my mouth it's a party in his

169
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:30,019
terms a party in my mouth flavors um you

170
00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:31,519

171
00:08:30,019 --> 00:08:36,470

173
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:41,450
gone I can feel it gone

174
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:46,940
uplifting just the smell of those Turks

175
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:50,120
to me is something that that does

176
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:53,330
something to you you know like that now

177
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:55,100
this is orange creamsicle this is the

178
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:57,110
bubbleman brand that's dropping right

179
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:59,779
away Superbowl weekend coming up here at

180
00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:02,570
Harbor side go check it out if if you're

181
00:08:59,779 --> 00:09:04,610
in town in California this one I find

182
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:08,060
amazing because when you smell it out

183
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:09,409
here if you can catch the waft I want

184
00:09:08,059 --> 00:09:11,299
it's it's creamy

185
00:09:09,409 --> 00:09:13,189
I want the dope from that I want to see

186
00:09:11,299 --> 00:09:16,759
the dope on the house from that and that

187
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:18,620
Lee it's creamy from a distance yet like

188
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:20,240
six receipt when you get it close to

189
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:22,310
your nose citrus we thought so it goes

190
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,960
really when you get up close it grabs

191
00:09:22,309 --> 00:09:25,459
you but down over here it's more like

192
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:28,009
the cream so you get that orange

193
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:30,610
creamsicle it is not a tan G it is not a

194
00:09:28,009 --> 00:09:33,679
Cali oh it is not a skunk number one

195
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:36,350
it's got some really unique flavors and

196
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:38,829
I think we're gonna get dip in here

197
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:38,830
right a wedding

198
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:49,629
telling you man dippy it's getting tippy

199
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:52,360
with it yeah we are just doing little

200
00:09:49,629 --> 00:09:54,399
rips it's this is not like the gauntlet

201
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:57,279
of dry sift know where we were taking

202
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:59,470
full-size rips but this this is about

203
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:01,480
really understanding the subtle nuances

204
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:05,620
of the modulation not that he destroyed

205
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:07,930
our debt not getting destroyed on 18 we

206
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:09,700
know if we take 18 roots of rosin or

207
00:10:07,929 --> 00:10:13,329
bubble hash or dry sift that we're going

208
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:15,820
to get double do very very stoned this

209
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:18,190
is more about just understanding the

210
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:19,840
subtle nuances of the terpenes and those

211
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:24,550
modulations what I find and we were

212
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:28,000
talking about the way THC starts as a

213
00:10:24,549 --> 00:10:29,500
buzz it has a real loo and then it has

214
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,179
this thing and I can't remember the name

215
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:34,389
skunk man Sam called it it's like a

216
00:10:31,179 --> 00:10:36,789
synth a door something it it it ends and

217
00:10:34,389 --> 00:10:38,049
that's the sort of the burnout or the

218
00:10:36,789 --> 00:10:40,569
whatever and he was saying that the

219
00:10:38,049 --> 00:10:43,029
terpenes they kind of just turned that

220
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:45,100
part of it off so he hit the buzz and

221
00:10:43,029 --> 00:10:47,230
then you just kind of keep floating on

222
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:52,870
that buzz there's not definitely you

223
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:55,200
know orange creamsicle this is gonna be

224
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:55,200
a treat

225
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:16,300
let a little bit of that one out your

226
00:11:10,659 --> 00:11:17,799
nose just the tiniest little bit I

227
00:11:16,299 --> 00:11:19,269
thought so too I wouldn't do the whole

228
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:21,578
hand I just let out a little bit and

229
00:11:19,269 --> 00:11:24,669
then I blew it out of my mouth but the

230
00:11:21,578 --> 00:11:30,759
flavor in my nose now from letting that

231
00:11:24,669 --> 00:11:34,240
out is just this incredibly orange

232
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:37,509
citrus it tastes like [ __ ] orange

233
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:40,539
creamsicle right that's the that is

234
00:11:37,509 --> 00:11:46,059
bottom line I'm gonna go [ __ ] get an

235
00:11:40,539 --> 00:11:47,469
orange creamsicle does this with that

236
00:11:46,059 --> 00:11:50,109
bloat out of the booth that blown out of

237
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:53,528
the the nose and I got the Terps in the

238
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:55,720
nose hairs and that it's like oh it's

239
00:11:53,528 --> 00:11:57,070
incredible when I first smelled the

240
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,050
orange creamsicle because obviously I

241
00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:01,300
wanted to it was the brand the photo of

242
00:11:59,049 --> 00:12:04,299
abhash shut up right now so you can see

243
00:12:01,299 --> 00:12:05,889
the orange creamsicle hat I wanted to

244
00:12:04,299 --> 00:12:08,019
have it right away so to be able to have

245
00:12:05,889 --> 00:12:10,360
the terpenes these are cannabinoid free

246
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:12,899
terpenes there are just terpenes present

247
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:23,740
in here Wow Oh God

248
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:25,448
holy this one think purple it's just

249
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:27,669
like though that was so strong oh

250
00:12:25,448 --> 00:12:32,909
because I didn't add the second word

251
00:12:27,669 --> 00:12:34,948
think punch it's the purple punch POW

252
00:12:32,909 --> 00:12:45,969
right in the kisser

253
00:12:34,948 --> 00:12:48,609
holy okay for the people at home that

254
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:51,040
aren't getting the experience there are

255
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:53,230
multi dimensions going on in these

256
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:55,208
flavors and as you move them away and

257
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:57,250
move them closer to your nose you

258
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:59,289
experience those sort of flavored

259
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:01,600
dimensions differently and so that's

260
00:12:59,289 --> 00:13:02,360
what he just experienced as he was going

261
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,089
in and out

262
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:07,129
he was you catch the spike of these

263
00:13:05,089 --> 00:13:10,490
flavors that are elusive this one not so

264
00:13:07,129 --> 00:13:14,299
elusive it's really like pow yes sir in

265

to the face right here we go just

279
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:58,060
sparring with my buddy purple punch

280
00:14:13,379 --> 00:14:22,309
[Music]

281
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:24,870
[Laughter]

282
00:14:22,309 --> 00:14:28,759
holy is right let's have a glass of

283
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:28,759
water holy

284
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:35,639
you know the purple punch it smelled

285
00:14:33,629 --> 00:14:37,200
very strong to me but its flavor was

286
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:38,879
almost elusive and I don't know if

287
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:41,490
that's because I blew it out my nostrils

288
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:43,019
that one was very different from the

289
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:45,659
orange creamsicle blowing it out my

290
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:47,639
nostrils was more of that expected Qi

291
00:14:45,659 --> 00:14:50,129
raspy like I feel like I'm gonna sneeze

292
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:51,449
type of thing hmm hmm what would you

293
00:14:50,129 --> 00:14:56,879
have to say on the flavors did you catch

294
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:58,830
the flavor I caught at the end hmm that

295
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:05,539
and flavor on the back of the tongue

296
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:05,540
purpley like well what's that strain

297
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:11,940
purple punch this is the purple purple

298
00:15:10,529 --> 00:15:13,649
business straining purple punch you know

299
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,100
that's the string purple punch down in

300
00:15:13,649 --> 00:15:16,379
Cali

301
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:18,690
we've got strains up here everybody gets

302
00:15:16,379 --> 00:15:21,000
strains mixed up and changes names oh

303
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:26,190
yeah this strain reminds me of something

304
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:31,409
that that I've had before ro said that

305
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:32,970
about this one this is the sunset KB and

306
00:15:31,409 --> 00:15:36,029
listen KB what's Kb

307
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:40,279
I have no idea it's killer bud that

308
00:15:36,029 --> 00:15:44,100
maybe it's on my my label as sunset KB

309
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:46,620
now I let ro smell this yesterday then

310
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:50,129
right away he said whoa and then he went

311
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:54,960
whoa that reminds me something from my

312
00:15:50,129 --> 00:15:56,399
past hmm it's a Celtic feeling it's a

313
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,840
little bit you don't smell if you put it

314
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,579
too close that one's one you kind of

315
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:02,540
have to go far and close far and close

316
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:10,080
and you'll catch it in the in-between

317
00:16:02,539 --> 00:16:12,110
mm-hmm so yeah that's number five number

318
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,110
five

319
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:18,700
these types of terpenes have any effect

320
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:22,028
well it's definitely making me

321
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:24,040
lightheaded like you know like like some

322
00:16:22,028 --> 00:16:25,419
people would have gas or some [ __ ] you

323
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:28,028
think it'd get some [ __ ] up because

324
00:16:25,419 --> 00:16:29,679
well you know what there isn't there is

325
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:31,269
an argument about that the lot of the

326
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:32,649
people that I kind of call them haters

327
00:16:31,269 --> 00:16:35,889
cuz I don't think they're creating a

328
00:16:32,649 --> 00:16:37,539
proper open dialogue yes we do not okay

329
00:16:35,889 --> 00:16:40,299
first of all we do know that inhaling

330
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:44,919
terpenes on cannabis has been done for

331
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:47,289
thousands of years for maybe tens of you

332
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:49,349
know 10 to 50 or 60 years people have

333
00:16:47,289 --> 00:16:52,539
been smoking or maybe even longer

334
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:54,730
concentrates you know at the next level

335
00:16:52,539 --> 00:16:56,379
not just hatched but like oils and

336
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:58,330
concentrates made into you know

337
00:16:56,379 --> 00:17:00,700
extremely simply murdered Houghton's

338
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:02,950
know and so the terpenes are very high

339
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:05,588
in some of these concentrates very high

340
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:08,588
in fact almost as highest and higher

341
00:17:05,588 --> 00:17:10,240
sometimes than the flavors that have

342
00:17:08,588 --> 00:17:12,730
been tested hashes that have been tested

343
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,949
with added terpenes so Tony added

344
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:16,328
terpenes to one of his roses I think at

345
00:17:14,949 --> 00:17:18,068
the Emerald cup and then there was a

346
00:17:16,328 --> 00:17:20,109
product that had a higher terpene

347
00:17:18,068 --> 00:17:22,509
content than his and they didn't add

348
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:25,509
terpenes so we are used to inhaling

349
00:17:22,509 --> 00:17:28,420
these terpenes at a fairly high dose at

350
00:17:25,509 --> 00:17:30,490
least for the last 10 or 20 years but at

351
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:32,410
the same time we do know that terpenes

352
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:34,599
can act as solvents they can break down

353
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:36,730
plastics and that there probably is

354
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:39,069
going to be a level of that sort of

355
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:42,190
huffing now I like to think that we're

356
00:17:39,069 --> 00:17:45,759
much more like you know inhaling on a

357
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:47,650
level of like aromatherapy where you can

358
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:50,289
pass around a bunch of aromas and people

359
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:51,610
would we're not like you know what I

360
00:17:50,289 --> 00:17:53,649
mean in like a baby I don't see that

361
00:17:51,609 --> 00:17:56,259
taped worth I don't get enjoyment from

362
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:57,790
doing nothing from this I really it's a

363
00:17:56,259 --> 00:17:59,529
subtle thing that I like about these

364
00:17:57,789 --> 00:18:02,470
Terps it would definitely be a nice

365
00:17:59,529 --> 00:18:03,970
aroma to have throughout the house all

366
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:06,308
the time right

367
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:10,058
like just subtly yeah all you needed is

368
00:18:06,308 --> 00:18:13,558
so it yeah how do you feel after five

369
00:18:10,058 --> 00:18:16,720
tert menthe hits though eight I feel I

370
00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:19,509
feel like close to his baked as I could

371
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:22,180
be yet I know when I hit this I'm

372
00:18:19,509 --> 00:18:24,849
to be more elevated and what about the

373
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:27,009
term baked baked does it work against us

374
00:18:24,849 --> 00:18:29,500
to use these terms in the recreational

375
00:18:27,009 --> 00:18:32,799
you know market is that is it a negative

376
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:34,750
word you know I have a kated yeah but I

377
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:37,960
mean even that one seems like a sham and

378
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:39,519
that we're hiding seems phony reminded I

379
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,539
don't know what the term is maybe you

380
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:43,139
guys can come up with some great

381
00:18:40,539 --> 00:18:45,730
comments at this point because like

382
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:47,530
something positive that doesn't have the

383
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:54,759
negative connotation that's like yeah

384
00:18:47,529 --> 00:18:58,410
you know exactly go smoke another joint

385
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:58,410
all right so sunset can be

386
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:16,929
oh my god now that's that's incredible

387
00:19:13,528 --> 00:19:19,929
how that was like loud like citrus but

388
00:19:16,929 --> 00:19:21,759
not really citrusy you know what I'm

389
00:19:19,929 --> 00:19:22,929
saying and it's almost changing more in

390
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:26,759
the back of my throat where I'm getting

391
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:29,200
a fruity flavor to that a fruit basket

392
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:34,509
exactly it's not citrusy but it's loud

393
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:36,940
like never library wow that one was

394
00:19:34,509 --> 00:19:39,519
really nice banana strawberry and some

395
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:42,489
[ __ ] memo and some lime to it some

396
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:45,460
set sunset kb is definitely huge herbs

397
00:19:42,489 --> 00:19:46,989
are very very flavorful that was so that

398
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:49,840
was nice when we got going on here we

399
00:19:46,989 --> 00:19:51,579
got pineapple cream and we got OG Tahoe

400
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:53,230
og

401
00:19:51,579 --> 00:19:55,928
this one goes right on the other side of

402
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:57,788
this one yeah keep them attached to

403
00:19:55,929 --> 00:20:01,080
their dabber you know so they're

404
00:19:57,788 --> 00:20:04,480
touching each dab or so pineapple cream

405
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:06,428
oh yo you just put that one down I just

406
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,749
put this one back sunset KB and then I

407
00:20:06,429 --> 00:20:10,149
pulled up the next one it's just

408
00:20:07,749 --> 00:20:12,730
pineapple closed right somehow I'm

409
00:20:10,148 --> 00:20:17,858
staying on the ball it's not gonna hit

410
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:19,599
last I don't know I'm telling you these

411
00:20:17,858 --> 00:20:21,519
are micro hits to we're definitely not

412
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:22,868
hitting I'll show a camera shot of like

413
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:25,329
the size of the hits that were hitting

414
00:20:22,868 --> 00:20:29,168
they're just little too little you know

415
00:20:25,329 --> 00:20:31,949
maybe match heads of rosin yeah not even

416
00:20:29,169 --> 00:20:31,950
a match head

417
00:20:32,038 --> 00:20:36,069
it's sure okay we got to get through

418
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:38,769
these well we got to get through them

419
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:41,558
and I have to say like I feel right now

420
00:20:38,769 --> 00:20:46,378
off of these five or six whatever we've

421
00:20:41,558 --> 00:20:48,339
hit now small rips better quality

422
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:50,738
whatever you want to call this once

423
00:20:48,339 --> 00:20:52,778
again hi if you will with none of the

424
00:20:50,739 --> 00:20:55,119
negative connotations a better quality

425
00:20:52,778 --> 00:20:56,378
high is achieved especially with the

426
00:20:55,118 --> 00:20:59,108
different terpenes and all the

427
00:20:56,378 --> 00:21:01,329
modulating I mean we this is for fun we

428
00:20:59,108 --> 00:21:03,548
could literally use just one terpene a

429
00:21:01,329 --> 00:21:05,319
day and and feel the effects of morning

430
00:21:03,548 --> 00:21:08,259
noon and night and how the modulation

431
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:09,629
changes that strain but this is just a

432
00:21:08,259 --> 00:21:11,009
good old fun thing to show

433
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:14,070
and this is something you guys can do

434
00:21:11,009 --> 00:21:15,480
yourselves blue river extracts calm you

435
00:21:14,069 --> 00:21:18,629
can literally go on there and you can

436
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:20,880
order many of these strains if not all

437
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:22,770
of them so if you're in the US I know

438
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,750
that blue river is going to be opening

439
00:21:22,769 --> 00:21:26,250
up in Canada eventually I'm trying to

440
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:29,609
help out with that and that'll be at

441
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:30,900
blue river extract CA so hopefully you

442
00:21:29,609 --> 00:21:32,788
know people will be able to get to play

443
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:35,070
there's a lot of different people making

444
00:21:32,788 --> 00:21:39,859
terpenes I think everybody needs these

445
00:21:35,069 --> 00:21:41,730
in their lives you know we love to

446
00:21:39,859 --> 00:21:45,298
recreationally smoke this and always

447
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:48,269
have but the medical benefits everything

448
00:21:45,298 --> 00:21:50,730
about it makes it such a bonus such a

449
00:21:48,269 --> 00:21:52,200
bonus that what we're doing and then all

450
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:55,409
of a sudden there's something else that

451
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:57,690
makes it medically better it's beyond a

452
00:21:55,409 --> 00:22:00,750
bonus let's just after being the black

00:22:39,058 --> 00:22:43,500
it comes to cannabis there's no debate

474
00:22:40,829 --> 00:22:45,779
it's like either right you're not [ __ ]

475
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:48,538
gonna be wrong truth is on its side and

476
00:22:45,779 --> 00:22:50,129
it's you know it's brought us here today

477
00:22:48,538 --> 00:22:52,879
for the turf dips I'm dipped I'm a

478
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:55,350
pineapple terrine I'm cross the old

479
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:57,710
young there we go we're doing this this

480
00:22:55,349 --> 00:22:57,709
is fun

481
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:27,150
oh wow oh that second hit was definitely

482
00:23:11,339 --> 00:23:28,409
pineapple the first hit I hit I blew out

483
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:30,450
and I thought it was gonna have a really

484
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:33,630
strong taste because it was obviously

485
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:37,019
the first hit it had very little taste i

486
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:39,060
carp capped it and hit it again and wow

487
00:23:37,019 --> 00:23:41,940

actually so will the dream classic I

556
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:28,410
mean to me it right away the first thing

557
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:30,150
I smell in it is the commercial mists of

558
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:31,590
it now don't get me wrong I'm not

559
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:34,800
dissing on Blue Dream it's got a

560
00:27:31,589 --> 00:27:36,779
beautiful smell it's great herb that a

561
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:38,700
lot of people can grow and get yields on

562
00:27:36,779 --> 00:27:40,319
and make a nice-looking product you know

563
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:47,490
kind of like a triple-a or whatever they

564
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:50,189
call it today quads yet it's it's got

565
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:51,450
that commercial favor to it though that

566
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:55,350
like the sugar bear

567
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:57,480
the Jamaican the you know although it

568
00:27:55,349 --> 00:27:58,799
was juicy the juicy fruit all the

569
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,180
commercial ones we had you nailed it

570
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:02,730
dude those that you smell it there you

571
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:06,600
know but now try to get past that sorry

572
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:08,940
about my telephone and get into the

573
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:10,829
actual past the commercial flavor of it

574
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:12,509
there's a nice profile to be had in blue

575
00:28:10,829 --> 00:28:15,449
dream I do enjoy I think that I liked

576
00:28:12,509 --> 00:28:17,730
about the juicy fruit was it was the

577
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:19,860
very start of it I liked the first

578
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:22,440
couple joints out of the bag behind it

579
00:28:19,859 --> 00:28:26,689
was just wore off but the flavor of and

580
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:26,690
the taste was just something else I

581
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,720
should be fine I was gonna unplug it if

582
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:33,599
it if it lights up again we'll go unplug

583
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:35,160
it so I'm dipped do do bells even nicer

584
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:38,039
on the dip rather than from the jar you

585
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:39,750
get of a more open air it's another

586
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:41,609
thing about the terpenes they are so

587
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:43,529
different in if you change their

588
00:28:41,609 --> 00:28:45,779
environment smelling them in an enclosed

589
00:28:43,529 --> 00:28:47,579
jar is very different from taking a drop

590
00:28:45,779 --> 00:28:49,740
of them and placing it on a glass dish

591
00:28:47,579 --> 00:28:54,230
in open air see what I'm saying

592
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:54,230
all right buddy can you dream

593
00:29:07,289 --> 00:29:11,940
definitely had a lot of the juicy fruit

594
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:21,220
Jamaican sugar bears flavor mmm there's

595
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:24,759
something else there if that's just so

596
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:27,250
pronounced it's very nice it's pleasant

597
00:29:24,759 --> 00:29:28,660
it's nowhere near as powerful as some of

598
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:31,690
the ones we've tried already like the

599
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:34,029
last one it's subtle it's more silent

600
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:36,490
subtle but it's flat it's flavorful like

601
00:29:34,029 --> 00:29:38,558
it's it wouldn't be something I get

602
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:40,419
tired of like I would if I was smoking

603
00:29:38,558 --> 00:29:43,899
the juicy fruit you know what I mean

604
00:29:40,419 --> 00:29:46,870
that's still a flavor oh if I hide the

605
00:29:43,900 --> 00:30:01,110
terms I'd be dipping double dipping

606
00:29:46,869 --> 00:30:01,109
triple dipping which ones that the red

607
00:30:01,798 --> 00:30:16,210
the red congolese right oh just wait

608
00:30:14,919 --> 00:30:18,040
dude you are not gonna believe it

609
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:20,740

610
00:30:18,039 --> 00:30:23,700

614
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:36,160

616
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:44,620

00:32:52,109 --> 00:33:03,599
it's a giddy high all of this yeah well

650
00:32:55,589 --> 00:33:03,779
cuz we're uplifting oh and oh there we

651
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:08,039
go

652
00:33:03,779 --> 00:33:10,799
I swear to God as crazy as it sounds in

653
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:13,710
the middle of the gauntlet right 9in

654
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:16,289
right we got another nine to go and I'm

655
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:19,980
literally considering taking another hit

656
00:33:16,289 --> 00:33:28,440
of the red Congo before I move on let's

657
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:30,509
do it the cheese bomb let's go oh it up

658
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,740
lets you follow it up with one so we go

659
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:34,529
through the whole gauntlet but then we

660
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:36,539
finish it with red with the red Congo or

661
00:33:34,529 --> 00:33:38,910
unless there's one we find that it was

662
00:33:36,539 --> 00:33:40,409
hurtful punch I mean I like the red

663
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:42,630
Congo more personally but you can finish

664
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:44,490
it with is that purple pods really stuck

665
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:48,890
in my head well not maybe the one you're

666
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:48,890
they finish with try this cheese bomb

667
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:57,660
amazing differences now there's gonna be

668
00:33:54,900 --> 00:34:00,720
carry awfully there's going to be a

669
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:02,400
similarity of a few terpenes in every

670
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,950
batch and you could pick that up you

671
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:07,200
know I think to the subtle knows the

672
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:09,480
person that doesn't have the ability of

673
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,668
a very strong olfactory they might say

674
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:13,590
something like these kind of all smell

675
00:34:11,668 --> 00:34:15,868
the same even though there are really

676
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:18,190
quite vast differences huge differences

677
00:34:15,869 --> 00:34:20,230
there are minor Silurian

678
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:22,389
you'll be like oh I smell and then I'm

679
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:23,858
right away it's like like smell that

680
00:34:22,389 --> 00:34:25,929
that is like similar to what we've

681
00:34:23,858 --> 00:34:29,289
smelled and yet nothing like anything

682
00:34:25,929 --> 00:34:31,240
we've smelled catching that yeah it's

683
00:34:29,289 --> 00:34:33,068
hard because that's rolling about every

684
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:40,378
one of them like that okay go ahead red

685
00:34:33,068 --> 00:34:43,119
congolese holy crap so good dude so good

686
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:44,348
blowing and I don't know I haven't hit

687
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:45,789
the cheese bomb yet there's a few I

688
00:34:44,349 --> 00:34:47,169
haven't hit yet so you're really the

689
00:34:45,789 --> 00:34:50,139
first person I've hit all of these

690
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:53,679
flavors with I did it to you again yeah

691
00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:58,919
I'm gonna stop doing that maybe I gotta

692
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:58,918
be quicker maybe it's me not you buddy

693
00:34:59,369 --> 00:35:09,369
getting off gonna stop what we're

694
00:35:03,099 --> 00:35:11,380
[ __ ] very cannabinoid saturated well

695
00:35:09,369 --> 00:35:13,660
we're saturated we are endocannabinoids

696
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:14,579
that's the most terpenes I've been in my

697
00:35:13,659 --> 00:35:17,980
whole life

698
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:19,690
Turbie tert we're at the gas station

699
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:20,980
getting turfed up here on bubble man's

700
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:22,210
world and we're just glad that you guys

701
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:25,300
are joining us for those of you that

702
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:30,300
have your Blue River terpenes with you

703
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:30,300
we're about to hit another one keep up

704
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:53,818
oh that was nice nice cheese bomb now

705
00:35:51,409 --> 00:35:59,460
not funky cheese at all

706
00:35:53,818 --> 00:36:02,130
more like cheesecake bomb came out just

707
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:05,970
I don't know that was a really pleasant

708
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:08,700
taste it wasn't funky it wasn't really

709
00:36:05,969 --> 00:36:10,348
[ __ ] it wasn't a punch like - that

710
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:13,199
wasn't a brunch but it was definitely

711
00:36:10,349 --> 00:36:15,150
not super subtle either like I can I can

712
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:16,980
taste it in my mouth fairly strong taste

713
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:19,079
on my lips and believe it or not each

714
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:21,269
time we hit one these are so pronounced

715
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:25,970
you can do it with essential oils it is

716
00:36:21,269 --> 00:36:29,759
very different each time very different

717
00:36:25,969 --> 00:36:34,078
so and I've tried those Turpin's that

718
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:35,670
are you know like done from a whole

719
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:36,809
bunch of other terpenes I made into a

720
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:40,769
profile oh yeah

721
00:36:36,809 --> 00:36:44,130
not from cannabis right and then they're

722
00:36:40,769 --> 00:36:46,829
you know mixed with the clear or you

723
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:49,950
know put on some rosin or whatever

724
00:36:46,829 --> 00:37:01,920
dipped or dropped onto some some hash

725
00:36:49,949 --> 00:37:03,328
and I can't tell the difference no no I

726
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:06,599
know but I was just like take your time

727
00:37:03,329 --> 00:37:07,920
I think would you would and I think

728
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:11,119
we're hitting a rip every minute and a

729
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:15,450
half to three minutes where do they go

730
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:22,079
you were talking about laughing being

731
00:37:15,449 --> 00:37:24,659
giddy what this you remember that about

732
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:27,780
what we did with the speed you got

733
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:30,149
speeding tickets oh yeah and we did we

734
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:32,519
both and I thought my manager didn't pay

735
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:34,430
out pay it I was worried oh yeah

736
00:37:32,519 --> 00:37:39,239
I didn't pay mine yet we paid ours twice

737
00:37:34,429 --> 00:37:42,029
really yeah hmm yeah lucky for them they

738
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:44,279
paid us back the once I was so like

739
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:45,310
intense about him paying and he paid it

740
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:49,150
twice

741
00:37:45,309 --> 00:37:51,179
so then he got it the check back in the

742
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:54,070
mail here we go

743
00:37:51,179 --> 00:37:56,230
vitamin C B D hadn't mentioned that yet

744
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:58,660
had I this is the vitamin C B D this was

745
00:37:56,230 --> 00:38:01,059
an award winner jeez I think Tony and I

746
00:37:58,659 --> 00:38:05,489
we took first at the Emerald cup with

747
00:38:01,059 --> 00:38:23,679
the vitamin C V D rosin SAP that's

748
00:38:05,489 --> 00:38:24,809
busted out under the brand you know what

749
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:27,789
I've got an idea

750
00:38:24,809 --> 00:38:29,529
mmm I'm gonna turn my nail down just a

751
00:38:27,789 --> 00:38:33,969
little bit I'm gonna go down a little

752
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:35,350
bit more like maybe say let's say 540 so

753
00:38:33,969 --> 00:38:37,719
you have to push the square button once

754
00:38:35,349 --> 00:38:45,599
yeah and then just go down to 540 you're

755
00:38:37,719 --> 00:38:51,279
good but in the CBD lovely pretty nice

756
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:53,589
has a similarity the what was the one

757
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,750
that tasted similar to the oh the blue

758
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:57,760
dream I find the vitamin CBD to have a

759
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:58,210
little bit of a blue dream esque flavor

760
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,370
to it

761
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:03,190
whatever that terpene profile is that we

762
00:39:00,369 --> 00:39:06,309
spoke about that's the CBD

763
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:08,889
yeah vitamin CBD it's called so CBD is a

764
00:39:06,309 --> 00:39:10,509
CBD strain obviously yeah I know that's

765
00:39:08,889 --> 00:39:12,159
it's a bit of a misnomer because

766
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:14,410
obviously I don't know why they put

767
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:16,059
choose to call it CBD over anything else

768
00:39:14,409 --> 00:39:17,920
but it's not good anything to do with

769
00:39:16,059 --> 00:39:19,449
sea wheedies well it has everything to

770
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:21,940
do with CBD and the fact that it's a

771
00:39:19,449 --> 00:39:23,710
high CBD profile plant so CBD is

772
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:26,200
probably the highest percentage of

773
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:28,210
cannabinoid okay and then it might be a

774
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:28,539
ratio right it's only one or ten to one

775
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:30,250
I

776
00:39:28,539 --> 00:39:33,070
I'm not sure off the top of my head I

777
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:34,449
should know but maybe someone will know

778
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:39,370
and they can post it in the comment

779
00:39:34,449 --> 00:39:42,159
section does anything change because of

780
00:39:39,369 --> 00:39:43,569
the CVD or the THC in the terpenes I've

781
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:46,750
always thought that they would probably

782
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:48,580
find that the terpene profile obviously

783
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:50,670
it's the it's the modulator so I

784
00:39:48,579 --> 00:39:53,380
wouldn't be very surprised if it didn't

785
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:55,510
modulate CBD effects that terpene

786
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:58,090
profiles that are specific to high CBD

787
00:39:55,510 --> 00:40:01,060
strains should be as much paid attention

788
00:39:58,090 --> 00:40:03,400
to as the percentage of CBD so when

789
00:40:01,059 --> 00:40:05,820
you're when you're really high and you

790
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:09,670
say well now yes and you smoke a CBD

791
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:12,160
isn't it supposed to level you out call

792
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:14,289
me down get you a little like take it a

793
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:17,500
bit if you were hitting high amounts of

794
00:40:14,289 --> 00:40:20,349
the cannabinoid yeah and if if the

795
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:23,530
terpenes modulated without the CBD

796
00:40:20,349 --> 00:40:24,519
present absolutely because with that

797
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:27,760
last toke

798
00:40:24,519 --> 00:40:30,829
literally I'm not stoned anymore okay so

799
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:34,720
there you go so your bio acid says this

800
00:40:30,829 --> 00:40:37,809
[Laughter]

801
00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:37,809
[Music]

802
00:40:38,039 --> 00:40:43,539
okay so we're getting the Gorilla Glue

803
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:47,170
real nice I've heard so much of this

804
00:40:43,539 --> 00:40:50,139
about this yes just glue is great really

805
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:54,180
glue is like boom pow snaps the terpene

806
00:40:50,139 --> 00:40:56,650
really really represents the flowers

807
00:40:54,179 --> 00:40:58,960
accurately anyone that grows gorilla

808
00:40:56,650 --> 00:41:01,150
glue or knows gorilla glue very well as

809
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:03,190
a smoker and aficionado of hashish of

810
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:05,789
concentrates they are gonna [ __ ]

812
00:41:05,789 --> 00:41:18,090
kaboom as fine as you are

813
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:18,090

Oh glue real nice glue hit at 5:39 let

815

816
00:41:48,179 --> 00:41:53,339
the full melt it tastes exactly like

817
00:41:50,699 --> 00:41:56,819
gorilla glue full melt that made me like

818
00:41:53,340 --> 00:42:00,769
picture caramely beautiful faux melt

819
00:41:56,820 --> 00:42:03,210
gorilla glue in my hand rather [ __ ]

820
00:42:00,769 --> 00:42:04,829
need another one here how about a couple

821
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:07,260
of smells while your another nice thing

822
00:42:04,829 --> 00:42:09,509
is to hit it and while you're you're

823
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:13,380
tasting it smell it while you're tasting

824
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:14,640
it and you pick up different nuances

825
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:17,369
that certainly you might not be able to

826
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:22,109
pick up on your nose alone oh it's

827
00:42:17,369 --> 00:42:25,170
powerful it's powerful its powerful it's

828
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:28,650
really like just [ __ ] in your face

829
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:31,320
that CBD one gave me a very lemony taste

830
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:34,860
without the citrus yeah less though the

831
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:36,600
citrus Ergo is a very soft lemon a lot

832
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:38,789
of people call it a cherry taste but

833
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:42,239
there is a fruity taste that I also pick

834
00:42:38,789 --> 00:42:45,779
up on different CBD strains definitely

835
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:47,579
that one is is also something quite

836
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:49,920
quite pick off the top of my head oh I'm

837
00:42:47,579 --> 00:42:55,559
excited for this though number oh yeah

838
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:56,130
Oh like maybe 12 this one might be my

839
00:42:55,559 --> 00:42:59,279
favorite

840
00:42:56,130 --> 00:43:00,119
just now smelling that you haven't tried

841
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:04,680
this one I

842
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:10,589
holy smokes okay so I'm not gonna tell

843
00:43:04,679 --> 00:43:14,250
you just smell that it's good clothes

844
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:17,789
it's not offensive that one oh right

845
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:21,590
I think pink as soon as I smallest that

846
00:43:17,789 --> 00:43:24,139
is a Kiwi I just think very nice soft

847
00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:27,980
pink color

848
00:43:24,139 --> 00:43:27,980
alright badge terms

849
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:35,570
that's the point ours chair having fun

850
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:37,220
here we're trying to make the video

851
00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:40,039
somewhat serious but come on we're doing

852
00:43:37,219 --> 00:43:42,679
a gauntlet of 18 ribs it'd be serious

853
00:43:40,039 --> 00:43:45,409
after 12 reps in didn't you just say

854
00:43:42,679 --> 00:43:49,599
that yes you know what it's even scarier

855
00:43:45,409 --> 00:43:49,599
is we are actually 12 ribs

856
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:57,890
tastes of that before you did cuz the

857
00:43:55,159 --> 00:44:00,500
smell or not has been just and you know

858
00:43:57,889 --> 00:44:02,629
what it reminds me it reminds me of

859
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:04,429
really nice head of ours didn't even

860
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:07,490
explain that to someone like a whole

861
00:44:04,429 --> 00:44:10,000
bouquet of the best smelling flowers

862
00:44:07,489 --> 00:44:12,949
yeah but cannabis flowers like there

863
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,500
you're right though there is a floral e

864
00:44:12,949 --> 00:44:16,909
like beautiful other like the right case

865
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:18,889
so this is an interesting thing that

866
00:44:16,909 --> 00:44:20,569
Darren's doing here is with the smelling

867
00:44:18,889 --> 00:44:23,210
instead of trying to break it down with

868
00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:25,039
with words there are pictures that are

869
00:44:23,210 --> 00:44:26,599
appear in your head when you smell some

870
00:44:25,039 --> 00:44:28,519
of these and I didn't get it at first

871
00:44:26,599 --> 00:44:30,650
but when he sent the flowers and then I

872
00:44:28,519 --> 00:44:32,840
said cannabis flowers right at the end

873
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:34,608
of that I picked up a hint of what you

874
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:37,220
were talking about those actual know

875
00:44:34,608 --> 00:44:39,259
like flowers and I wasn't talking bad

876
00:44:37,219 --> 00:44:43,608
terms I was talking actual the color

877
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:46,700
pink soft pink is what I seen first

878
00:44:43,608 --> 00:44:48,049
smelling it like God is that nice I like

879
00:44:46,699 --> 00:44:50,329
the way you just said that so seriously

880
00:44:48,050 --> 00:44:58,730
and I wasn't actually talking about bad

881
00:44:50,329 --> 00:45:02,000
curves on the discussion this is your

882
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:04,639
five star three-minute water turn we did

883
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,949
this one might be the longest time we've

884
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:10,159
waited yet but come on we're 12 in and

885
00:45:06,949 --> 00:45:11,839
there's we're no slouches we're doing

886
00:45:10,159 --> 00:45:13,190
the good work here we'll go backwards

887
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:15,289
and do it again

888
00:45:13,190 --> 00:45:18,710
maybe doing the good work of the Terps

889
00:45:15,289 --> 00:45:20,210
so love to learn about terpenes you can

890
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:22,880
do a couple of google searches you can

891
00:45:20,210 --> 00:45:24,349
join my facebook group called all things

892
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,608
terpene i would love to see more

893
00:45:24,349 --> 00:45:27,529
discussion there of course we're looking

894
00:45:25,608 --> 00:45:28,940
for people we don't claim to know a lot

895
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:30,440
about this stuff we're not telling you

896
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:30,869
that what we're even doing right now is

897
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:33,000
safe

898
00:45:30,869 --> 00:45:35,009
should be done nor are we condoning it

899
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,929
if you want to do it you're a big boy or

900
00:45:35,010 --> 00:45:39,090
a big girl by all means try it

901
00:45:36,929 --> 00:45:40,710
I'm sure the science in the next five to

902
00:45:39,090 --> 00:45:43,050
ten years will be very strong and

903
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:44,699
through the bio I said I have to admit

904
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:47,519
like just the way it makes me feel I

905
00:45:44,699 --> 00:45:54,109
feel that it's a good thing I don't feel

906
00:45:47,519 --> 00:45:58,590
too hot I feel and I don't feel wasted I

907
00:45:54,110 --> 00:46:23,390
feel anxious it's been so long since we

908
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:26,220
had a Terp red very nice aftertaste

909
00:46:23,389 --> 00:46:31,589
getting that florally aftertaste really

910
00:46:26,219 --> 00:46:42,959
strong lavender II definitely pinkish

911
00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:46,320
and purpley blues yeah that's beautiful

912
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:48,389
it was very nice not really every one of

913
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:51,750
these tokes when you exhale it and then

914
00:46:48,389 --> 00:46:55,650
you stop and sit back hmm you feel every

915
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:57,570
single one is a different little level

916
00:46:55,650 --> 00:47:00,150
it's easier I'm not convinced it

917
00:46:57,570 --> 00:47:02,490
direction there's no real ceiling right

918
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:04,970
it's kind of like a little bit of a just

919
00:47:02,489 --> 00:47:06,709
put us over here kind of whoa we're just

920
00:47:04,969 --> 00:47:09,359
halfway

921
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:14,610
set a nice tone you ready to get heavy

922
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:21,470
triple og might want to take a bit of a

923
00:47:14,610 --> 00:47:23,550
bigger dab for this one just saying god

924
00:47:21,469 --> 00:47:27,239
that's a little bit bigger than I was

925
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:29,190
gonna go good still going quite small by

926
00:47:27,239 --> 00:47:30,299
anyone's standards by no means are we

927
00:47:29,190 --> 00:47:32,519
trying to claim that we're taking

928
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:34,800
monster rips just do it in 18 yeah I

929
00:47:32,519 --> 00:47:38,280
can't do those ones some reps well I can

930
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:40,230
but they hurt me I recovered I could do

931
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:42,019
a monster up like that well hey you know

932
00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:43,760
what think of it this way we're set

933
00:47:42,019 --> 00:47:46,579
tone for the video and the next guy to

934
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:48,860
get 18 types of terpenes you should do

935
00:47:46,579 --> 00:47:51,650
it just take a half gram rip with each

936
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:53,930
Terp a couple of drops you know do the 9

937
00:47:51,650 --> 00:47:57,070
gram here's here's an idea

938
00:47:53,929 --> 00:47:59,690
what's that I'll throw out our you dip

939
00:47:57,070 --> 00:48:03,080

1014
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:58,870

they had wasn't a very good yield er at

1017
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:06,730
all but the smell of it was something

1018
00:53:04,030 --> 00:53:08,950
phenomenal and this is exactly that

1019
00:53:06,730 --> 00:53:10,659
smell so there it is right there people

1020
00:53:08,949 --> 00:53:12,219
ask me what are these Terps for if

1021
00:53:10,659 --> 00:53:13,960
you're just not dipping them if you're

1022
00:53:12,219 --> 00:53:15,789
not putting them into food products if

1023
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:18,400
you're not putting them the olfactory

1024
00:53:15,789 --> 00:53:21,279
memory triggers that these things cause

1025
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:23,710
I've seen many people since I've shown

1026
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:25,819
them have memory triggers from their

1027
00:53:23,710 --> 00:53:28,969
past and be like wow man

thanks boys I'll tell you an interesting

1036
00:54:18,978 --> 00:54:24,558
thing I find out about the Terps is this

1037
00:54:22,059 --> 00:54:25,099
it makes you want to keep having a

1038
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:27,519
session

1039
00:54:25,099 --> 00:54:31,609
it's exciting to keep going it doesn't

1040
00:54:27,518 --> 00:54:34,038
it doesn't kind of taper off it just

1041
00:54:31,608 --> 00:54:38,389
keeps growing through this beautiful

1042
00:54:34,039 --> 00:54:40,420
just soaring what this could be a thing

1043
00:54:38,389 --> 00:54:43,458
right here I mean I'm talking

1044
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:45,229
forget about vapor lounges and bars with

1045
00:54:43,458 --> 00:54:47,748
alcohol and stuff what what about the

1046
00:54:45,228 --> 00:54:49,759
tert bar or the turf experience where

1047
00:54:47,748 --> 00:54:52,098
you go to dinners you gather with people

1048
00:54:49,759 --> 00:54:53,778
nice glasses brought to the table at the

1049
00:54:52,099 --> 00:54:55,969
end of your food maybe even in between

1050
00:54:53,778 --> 00:54:58,369
your dessert and your food and you have

1051
00:54:55,969 --> 00:54:58,789
a Terp platter that comes out of courses

1052
00:54:58,369 --> 00:55:00,440
man

1053
00:54:58,789 --> 00:55:01,640
you choose your Terps that you guys all

1054
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:04,039
want to try and then you have this

1055
00:55:01,639 --> 00:55:07,759
beautiful experience we're just taking

1056
00:55:04,039 --> 00:55:09,920
micro doses and getting I read a Terp

1057
00:55:07,759 --> 00:55:13,099
dose with your mic with your with your

1058
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:16,818
house in between courses to eat just

1059
00:55:13,099 --> 00:55:19,039
like matching wine with food stuff would

1060
00:55:16,818 --> 00:55:21,498
be I could eat right now I have to say

1061
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:23,900
I'm not so totally stoned right now that

1062
00:55:21,498 --> 00:55:27,048
I couldn't eat a nice meal right now and

1063
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:31,050
I can always we've also also this pretty

1064
00:55:27,048 --> 00:55:33,900
extreme to go through 18 flavors each

1065
00:55:31,050 --> 00:55:35,970
I mean I'm sure someone's done it

1066
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:37,889
somewhere but I've never seen anyone do

1067
00:55:35,969 --> 00:55:40,079
it so who could answer that question

1068
00:55:37,889 --> 00:55:41,519
accurately lots of people out there in

1069
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:43,049
the world but I bet you it's the first

1070
00:55:41,519 --> 00:55:45,509
time you guys seen it on YouTube if you

1072
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:50,340

1076
00:56:02,579 --> 00:56:11,690
that you probably did but subconsciously

1077
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:14,309
cherry ak-47 and strawberry mind-warped

1078
00:56:11,690 --> 00:56:20,960

1081
00:56:26,849 --> 00:56:32,179
you know I guess the next sort of levels

1082
00:56:29,610 --> 00:56:36,510
of this stuff these Turk parties is

1083
00:56:32,179 --> 00:56:40,980
taking is is matching Turks with other

1084
00:56:36,510 --> 00:56:44,850
Terps and mixing and seeing what that is

1085
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:48,990
I guess for sure you know like the

1086
00:56:44,849 --> 00:56:51,750
Jeffrey the Jeff is the the Jeffrey when

1087
00:56:48,989 --> 00:56:54,419
you don't wipe your dabber with your

1088
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:56,280
deborah rag here you could end up kind

1089
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:59,550
of each time producing a little bit of a

1090
00:56:56,280 --> 00:57:02,190
Jeffrey effect and picking up effects

1091
00:56:59,550 --> 00:57:04,050
from the other ones although you know

1092
00:57:02,190 --> 00:57:05,909
I'm sure we've had a little bit of that

1093
00:57:04,050 --> 00:57:08,280
happen by no means I've been wiping my

1094
00:57:05,909 --> 00:57:13,710

1101
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:28,619

00:59:19,539 --> 00:59:24,369
and some cannabinoids and then using

1131
00:59:22,329 --> 00:59:26,110
hash in a separate Bowl this pipe melted

1132
00:59:24,369 --> 00:59:28,839
together only at the top mouthpiece

1133
00:59:26,110 --> 00:59:30,550
where the two vapors collided for the

1134
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:32,860
first time it was it was a beautiful

1135
00:59:30,550 --> 00:59:34,840
thing but this is some next-level [ __ ]

1136
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:37,990
that we're onto right now let me tell

1137
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:40,780

1138
00:59:37,989 --> 00:59:41,979
number 18 we motored through these dude

1139
00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:45,190
I'm almost willing to go through the

1140
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:47,050
backwards now I'm joking

1141
00:59:45,190 --> 00:59:49,579
18 is cool I wanted to make a short

1142
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:53,420
video I didn't want it to be 2 hours for

1143
00:59:49,579 --> 00:59:56,500

1147
01:00:01,429 --> 01:00:04,730
