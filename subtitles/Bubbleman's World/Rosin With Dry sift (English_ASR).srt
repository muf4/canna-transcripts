00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,240
hey guys welcome to Bubble man's world

3
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,519
uh it is still Sunday at about almost

4
00:00:25,239 --> 00:00:29,239
4:20 10 minutes till 4:20 I'll make sure

5
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:30,639
that we have a hit and in fact I'll make

6
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:33,199
sure we have a hit with what we're about

7
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,679
to do which is process a little bit of

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,719
rosin um in hash church today we had

9
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:39,600
soil grown from Instagram come in and

10
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:42,879
talk a little bit about his Bud Tech of

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,520
pressing buds in the um T-shirt press

12
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:46,238
which he does for less than a few

13
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,199
seconds at a certain temperature I think

14
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:50,599
it was around 300 or 280 uh ideally the

15
00:00:49,198 --> 00:00:53,320
hair straightener guys I think they were

16
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:56,359
talking about 200 to

17
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:58,920
230° um the tool that I actually have

18
00:00:56,359 --> 00:01:00,519
today is one of these small hair

19
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,000
straighteners could have had that

20
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:05,920
plugged in and ready real nice easy

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,599
switch on the inside to turn on and off

22
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,560
and we'll get to that in a little bit so

23
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:12,000
basically this is the process of milking

24
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:15,759
the resin glands from the plant matter

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,560
or from the hash um I have not done it

26
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:22,040
with plant matter yet but I did do one

27
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,478
little batch using some lower Quality

28
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:26,640
Dry sift so I figured because I know

29
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:28,519
that works for sure um I'm going to

30
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,879
start with that so I've got my pressing

31
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:33,560
screen from a25 Micron pressing screen

32
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:37,039
from a bubble bag kit uh I've got a

33
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:39,200
little bit of um parchment paper left

34
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,280
over from when D 420k gave me a bunch of

35
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,680
dry

36
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:46,000
sift and I've got the straightener and

37
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,079
then I've also actually got some slick

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,718
sheet I thought we would do a little bit

39
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:51,798
through the parchment paper and a little

40
00:01:49,718 --> 00:01:53,879
bit through the slick sheet and then we

41
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:55,600
could kind of see which one we liked

42
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:58,359
more right now most people are using the

43
00:01:55,599 --> 00:02:00,478
parchment paper uh without even the 25

44
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:02,399
micron screen

45
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:04,879
I think you find when you use the uh the

46
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,718
hash method uh when you're using hash

47
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:10,000
instead of Bud that it is actually quite

48
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:14,359
convenient to use it like that so yeah

49
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,360
just cut off a little a little

50
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:25,040
square all

51
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:28,919
right so this is some sort of

52
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:32,120
like much hotter temperatures can be um

53
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:33,759
can be used on this particular stuff so

54
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,480
we'll see how that goes we'll do the

55
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:37,318
experiment I managed to get just the

56
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:38,919
tiniest little bit of rosin on my finger

57
00:02:37,318 --> 00:02:41,158
and now I can feel it literally on

58
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:43,639
everything got to be careful with that

59
00:02:41,158 --> 00:02:45,519
stuff all right so what we're going to

60
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:48,518
do is we're going to take a little bit

61
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:51,280
of this no melt

62
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:54,400
sift got a little bit there you can kind

63
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,640
of see the quality I purified it but

64
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,360
it's not uh it's just not melty it's

65
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:01,279
just not happening on the Melt Factor so

66
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,440
think I Chang Chang the color of

67
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:06,158
the video we went a little blue there

68
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:08,439
well I'm okay with it if you guys are

69
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:10,519
okay with it anyway so what we're going

70
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:13,560
to do is we're going to get this hash

71
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:15,439
rolled into a little sort of section of

72
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,840
the pressing

73
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:20,680
screen this is what Jeff was showing us

74
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:24,560
today on hash church he twisted it up

75
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:27,319
kind of got it all twisted up like

76
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:31,280
that all right and then he merely took

77
00:03:27,318 --> 00:03:32,798
it and he placed it

78
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,039
between the pressing

79
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,799
screen between the parchment paper I

80
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:38,639
should

81
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:39,560
say so now it's just a matter of turning

82
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:43,719
this

83
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:45,158
on uh Jeff had a digital readout on his

84
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:47,959
he said the lowest temperature he could

85
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:50,598
turn this on to was about 230° so that's

86
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:53,840
what he was doing um I'm with Tony I

87
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:55,318
just kind of test test it with my finger

88
00:03:53,840 --> 00:04:00,158
and you can kind of see right off the

89
00:03:55,318 --> 00:04:02,359
bat as you start pressing it

90
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:06,560
you can kind of start seeing

91
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:09,560
resin want to leak leak out of

92
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:12,519
it I can see it already

93
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:14,920
starting then of course a little bit

94
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:16,560
more little bit more pressure a little

95
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:19,238
bit more

96
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:23,399
heat and now you can really see

97
00:04:19,238 --> 00:04:23,399
it kind of greasing up in

98
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:32,680
there all right so turn that little guy

99
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:35,039
off you saw that took a few seconds you

100
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:38,680
can open that

101
00:04:35,038 --> 00:04:40,918
up this is uh your press hash inside the

102
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:44,160
pressing screen which of course still

103
00:04:40,918 --> 00:04:46,918
has some Goods on there and then most

104
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,080
importantly you've got the dabs that you

105
00:04:46,918 --> 00:04:52,599
just got out of

106
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:54,879
that how impressive is

107
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,320
that actually let me pick that up

108
00:04:54,879 --> 00:05:00,038
because you guys need to see a little

109
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:00,038
bit better than that

110
00:05:05,478 --> 00:05:07,959
all right so I just pressed that right

111
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,639
out

112
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:13,399
of right out of that hash you saw it

113
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:16,038
right here on Bubble man's

114
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:18,719
world and I'm sure before you saw it on

115
00:05:16,038 --> 00:05:21,478
Bubble man's world if you're out there

116
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,560
at all you saw soil grown you saw Jeff

117
00:05:21,478 --> 00:05:24,918
church and you saw these couple other

118
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,560
characters that are out there doing

119
00:05:24,918 --> 00:05:30,318
these um processes I by no means am

120
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:32,199
claiming that I am the first

121
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:34,000
I just find it very interesting I think

122
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:37,439
it's pretty cool that we can get this

123
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:41,959
quality of resin out of a lower grade

124
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:43,879
lower quality of hash I can open that up

125
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:47,239
and you can see on the

126
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:48,478
inside what we're left with is that

127
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:52,360
lower

128
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:55,839
grade of hash that we've melted

129
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:58,639
so that was step one now why don't we

130
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:01,478
try doing that

131
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:04,639
again with that same little bit of

132
00:06:01,478 --> 00:06:07,879
hash and we'll wrap it in

133
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:10,120
the the other paper this time

134
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:12,279
around and we'll see what we can get off

135
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:15,439
of that we'll see if maybe there's more

136
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:17,799
of an attractant to this particular type

137
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:20,000
of of of parchment I mean it's not

138
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:23,319
parchment it's a Teflon type of

139
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,800
thing and I can see it already the oils

140
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:28,360
just from one little mild press I could

141
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:31,560
see the uh the oil is wanting to come

142
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:35,319
out oh yeah I can see them dripping

143
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,319
actually can you guys see

144
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:44,159
that all right

145
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,959
so okay second

146
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,918
grade milked off on that paper I think I

147
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:57,399
like the way it looks on this paper even

148
00:06:55,918 --> 00:06:59,918
better it looks as though even though

149
00:06:57,399 --> 00:07:01,679
the same amount of heat was applied I

150
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:04,000
didn't get the same amount of bubbles on

151
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,598
it and keep in mind this is an older

152
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,959
hash and I think the reason we're a

153
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:10,439
seeing this this darkness is because a

154
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:14,359
I'm new at this and I'm probably using

155
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:18,160
more heat than I need to but

156
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:20,439
also that this material is a little bit

157
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,120
older it's it's been dried for an

158
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:25,279
extremely long time and I think that has

159
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,478
a lot to do with it so I'm going to

160
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:30,519
photograph both the parchment as well as

161
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:33,199
the oh let's get the name right here the

162
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:35,120
oil slick sheet I'm going to call it the

163
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,319
slick sheet cuz that's what they call it

164
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,240
so the slick sheet also has some nice

165
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:41,560
material here I will photograph that for
