I'm here with Johnny B and uh we're here

4
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:29,118
in Ontario at weed MD one of the uh

5
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,000
future licensed production facilities so

6
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:33,719
uh we're going to take you uh in here

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,439

come all

10
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:49,198
right all right all right so here we are

11
00:00:45,878 --> 00:00:51,159
at the Vault Johnny B um

12
00:00:49,198 --> 00:00:52,159
yeah you know you know the best part of

13
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:54,558
all this

14
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:56,479
guys what's that this is where they're

15
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:58,679
going to store pounds and pounds of weed

16
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:00,839
like pounds and pounds of weed heo more

17
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:03,079
weed you've ever seen in so this is the

18
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,560
vault as you can see these guys are not

19
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:08,560
messing around this

20
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:10,759
door very thick looks like that might

21
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:14,280
stop some uh thieves from getting in all

22
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:16,000
right we got a 2T thick plus

23
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,680
concrete

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,359
and so Health Canada is not joking

25
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:23,759
around here they want level 9 to level

26
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:26,319
10 security which down in the US I think

27
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,759
that's like nasson Pentagon style it's

28
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:29,919
pretty ridiculous the whole thing is

29
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,400
tied in with cameras you can see a

30
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,079
camera up in the corner there I believe

31
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,159
Health Canada has access to all the

32
00:01:33,078 --> 00:01:37,239
cameras of all the facilities as well

33
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:39,320
they will so these are so this facility

34
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:41,199
is just being built obviously it's not

35
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:43,519
finished yet um they're in the middle of

36
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,520
uh acquiring their license and I I think

37
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:47,359
the building's 25,000 ft so we're just

38
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:51,319
going to do a little bit more of a walk

39
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:54,078
through machine what's this this is the

40
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:55,559
Destroyer the Destroyer this is what

41
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:58,319
they have to get rid of all their like

42
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,240
trim and stock and all the little extra

43
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:01,758
uh herbs and stuff what hell's that

44
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:04,000
[ __ ] bin over there we'll go into

45
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,959
here this bin over here is going to be

46
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,800
manure and it's going to mix in with the

47
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:11,318
material that they that they Rune so it

48
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,239
can't be processed or cleaned any

49
00:02:11,318 --> 00:02:15,359
further manure manure they're going to

50
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:17,759
take what they call waste that is

51
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,800
actually medicine and mix it with [ __ ]

52
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:21,039
yeah that's can and then we can grind it

53
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,000
up and feed it back to our plants I

54
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:26,079
guess right I guess so but it's a pretty

55
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,719
big serious unit you know what it's

56
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:32,239
going to be a big meat grinder it's big

57
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:34,039
grinder big grind very cool all right so

58
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:37,599
there's this

59
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:40,799
Vault water so the only thing we want to

60
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:42,919
get rid of is uh the chlorine right uh

61
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,480
if you want to use Organics you don't

62
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:47,158
want chlorine in your water will kill

63
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:49,318
your Organics there's two Caron filters

64
00:02:47,158 --> 00:02:51,039
to take care of that uh one other thing

65
00:02:49,318 --> 00:02:54,238
that's going to be added is two UV

66
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:57,280
lights okay yeah those work great Y and

67
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,800
that's about it

68
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,360
cool I know that Mario was talking about

69
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:04,280
about this damex control system and he

70
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,840
was oh there he is right there tell us a

71
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,959
little bit about this thing

72
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:12,200
man um it's a dosing system and you just

73
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,959
put your nutrients in here your your pH

74
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:16,000
Down your

75
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:19,080
micronutrients and then a computer

76
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,360
system will then initiate the irrigation

77
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:25,719
according to the humidity needs of the

78
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:27,519
soil wow and so you can really control

79
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:30,400
things on a different level with a

80
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:33,959
system like this yeah you can adjust

81
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:36,360
your dosing uh whatever the PPM you want

82
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:39,158
you can lower your HP to your desired

83
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:42,120
level the system then injects fresh

84
00:03:39,158 --> 00:03:44,438
filtered water through a spinning system

85
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:47,120
that mixes all the nutrients and then

86
00:03:44,438 --> 00:03:49,560
once it all the nutrients and mix sends

87
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,920
it over to the water room to the water

88
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,680
room awesome we're talking about

89
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:55,479
standardized exactly what we're talking

90
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,120
about we able to TA get well you're

91
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:58,719
getting you're getting the science down

92
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,360
here everything's done with computers

93
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:03,359
we're getting there they're precise

94
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,200
heating programs all the time nothing's

95
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,560
really changing too much where if it is

96
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:08,000
computer's monitor it there's not people

97
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,680
coming in here with gauges and sticks

98
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,878
and kind of winging it exactly there a

99
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,560
computer system in the office and um

100
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:17,079
what it does that's really is that

101
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,759
monitors all the levels at all times so

102
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:20,720
if you change anything in your feeding

103
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:22,879
cycle and you get good results you can

104
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,080
go back and say okay this is when we did

105
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:26,959
this yeah and it shows you okay now it's

106
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:28,279
easy to reproduce the same effect

107
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:30,120
because you can see where the changes

108
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:32,839
are taking place on the computer

109
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,000
it logs everything that's excellent

110
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:35,638
exactly what we're talking about here

111
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,600
and that's why we're uh well that's why

112
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:39,560
we're here explaining it to you and also

113
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,280
the other good thing is you save out

114
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,360
countless of hours of watering

115
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:44,439
everything by

116
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,160
hand yeah no that's completely

117
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:48,478
ridiculous to try and water the nice

118
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,960
thing about this system it um if you

119
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:53,519
need to water by hand for any reason

120
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:55,599
it's just a matter of switching a valve

121
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:57,758
and and you're off to manual Vol can you

122
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:01,039
show us where this is yeah of course

123
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,199
yeah let's check it out

124
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:05,240
so I guess this is still under

125
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:06,520
construction here look at that power box

126
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,280
they definitely have some power enough

127
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:11,799
power here to power approximately 10,000

128
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:12,918
lights 10,000 lights 10,000 lights yeah

129
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,639
well that's not even that's not an

130
00:05:12,918 --> 00:05:16,359
electrical room that's not even an

131
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,639
electrical room that's just the panel

132
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:21,240
just the panel all all right so now we

133
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:23,038
have a whole bunch of stuff going on in

134
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,879
here we're going to need explained okay

135
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:30,038
so we're building here a mother room on

136
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:31,478
the right hand side oh nice um once we

137
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:33,519
build out phase number two there's going

138
00:05:31,478 --> 00:05:35,918
to be two floors here yeah so we're

139
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:38,120
going to double up on

140
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:40,959
Space uh this section here will be the

141
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:43,399
bedroom for now and in the front corner

142
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:46,478
we're going to put a little floating in

143
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:48,799
oh okay and keep in mind this facility

144
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:50,318
is only half built so there's a lot of

145
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,840
things we still need to implement in

146
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:54,439
here sure this is all part of your

147
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:56,519
cooling system here he was telling me a

148
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:57,800
little bit about this earlier yeah these

149
00:05:56,519 --> 00:06:00,159
are the chiller

150
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:03,520
systems it is uh the the whole system is

151
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:06,800
cooled by glycol and it's uh 30% more

152
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:09,279
efficient than your standard gas heat uh

153
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,520
I mean um

154
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:13,198
electrical Electrical uh air

155
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:14,879
conditioning system and who you guys had

156
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:18,560
these guys come up from Colorado to set

157
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:20,319
this up yeah uh that that was the Hydra

158
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,240
innovations that came Hydra Innovations

159
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,919
okay right very good people yeah it

160
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,720
looks great so this is a closed loop

161
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:29,240
system that operates and pumps into both

162
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,880
rooms from your tanks that is correct

163
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:33,759
okay okay well I guess we'll head into

164
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:36,759
the got a punch key code no matter what

165
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:40,000
we we go into security absolutely key in

166
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:42,280
and out and out in out there is a any

167
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,959
room with any growing AC Security on

168
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:46,198
both you have to use the code plus you

169
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:48,638
have to use your key card to get

170
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:50,478
into and then of course each key card is

171
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:54,120
monitored by the person who owns that

172
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:55,839
key card the key card is uh so it's all

173
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,478
computer monitored and it's all

174
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:58,839
registered to the individual keys that

175
00:06:57,478 --> 00:07:01,680
tells you who's been in and who's been

176
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:05,079
out of what room rooms how how much time

177
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:07,038
has been spent in the rooms in Canada by

178
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:08,918
Health Canada standards there has to be

179
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:10,478
like a responsible person in charge and

180
00:07:08,918 --> 00:07:13,079
that's one of the challenging things in

181
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:14,639
our system is that not everybody working

182
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:16,560
in the facility will be a responsible

183
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:19,598
person because the clearance requirement

184
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:22,038
is really deep so the way this works is

185
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:25,000
the responsible person in charge can key

186
00:07:22,038 --> 00:07:26,560
in and then people can follow them in

187
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,759
cuz it knows that there's a responsible

188
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,360
person in the room and then if the

189
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:33,840
responsible person keys out he'll clear

190
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,720
the room and then nobody can key in and

191
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:39,239
when someone told me they move that's

192
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:41,960
interesting Ducks it's like ducks you

193
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:44,158
move like ducks w a lot well I know but

194
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:45,439
but Ducks move in in TOS yeah that's and

195
00:07:44,158 --> 00:07:47,079
you know what I just put the look in

196
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:48,959
here here's this Dynamic control system

197
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:51,399
we were just talking about now there's

198
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:53,519
there's another box here is this just

199
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:55,359
like a I mean relay box or how is this

200
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:58,120
working here the computer for the room

201
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,439
computer for the room this this secret

202
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:04,319
board here Will will initiate the

203
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:07,120
electronic irrigation system that's that

204
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:09,400
is connected to the aquamat system and

205
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,519
basically we have these moisture sensors

206
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:14,120
yeah I want you to tell us a bit about

207
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:17,038
these aquam mats oh the aquam mats um a

208
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:19,399
very good way to uh save a lot of

209
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:22,878
water and also save a lot of time having

210
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:24,878
to uh I'm disabled and I did this myself

211
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:28,680
and this thing is what 40 ft long and

212
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:31,319
weighs 72 ft long 72 ft long you can

213
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:33,000
literally move with uh couple fingers

214
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:37,839
wait a second

215
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,839
here that works oh wait did the broken

216
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:43,560
side that's pretty pimp I've never seen

217
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,278
that before so these these mats feed

218
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:49,278
based on these sensors yes where the

219
00:08:46,278 --> 00:08:52,958
pots are sitting the sensor will will

220
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:55,838
tell you at at any given time what the

221
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:58,078
moisture level is inside the soil you

222
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,839
can then choose when you'd like to

223
00:08:58,078 --> 00:09:02,359
initiate the watering you tell the

224
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:05,000
computer and every time the soil reaches

225
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:07,320
a certain moisture the computer will

226
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,078
then automatically uh do the watering

227
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,278
for you and there's no drip emitter

228
00:09:09,078 --> 00:09:14,039
system this is pushed up

229
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:17,000
through yes this is uh done through a

230
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:18,919
capillary action okay so it's a membrane

231
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
system that's feeding actually through

232
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:23,559
the mat yeah there's a special layer on

233
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,879
top so the roots cannot penetrate and

234
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:28,039
there's a special layer on the bottom

235
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:30,320
that will only allow the water to go

236
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:33,000
through once there's pressure applied to

237
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,120
the m interesting cool that's

238
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,159
unbelievable another note another note

239
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,759
about the water as to the damage attack

240
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:41,120
is that it's actually dosed where the

241
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:42,360
tanks are where we were earlier and so

242
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,639
that's where it's fed from and it's

243
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,720
automatically dosed and that's premixed

244
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:47,639
through these

245
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,480
mats all the valves are coming through

246
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:50,879
the rim and all the different at the

247
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,639
beginning of all the Ben so here's a

248
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:54,919
question in regards to feeding because

249
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:56,799
you're feeding a food through the mats

250
00:09:54,919 --> 00:10:00,120
do you think that the mats themselves

251
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:02,240
will require flushing of salts yeah yes

252
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:04,679
yes so there's two ways you can Flash

253
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,278
the mat is using water with hydrogen

254
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:11,120
peroxide or you can just use regular

255
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:14,000
water and PH down to 4.0 4.0 to knock

256
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:16,399
everything out

257
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,639
interesting that's a really cool

258
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:22,759
technology I have to say um I'm

259
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:25,919
impressed so you guys got about 100

260
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:27,799
lights in here there's 102 lights and

261
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:29,799
there's another additional 50 lights

262
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:32,639
that will be installed

263
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:34,439
in between these lights uh to uh to

264
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:37,240
illumin the sides of the plant and these

265
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:40,160
are your closed system air conditioners

266
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:42,959
you see all glyc cool system these

267
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:44,919
coolers oh oh These

268
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:46,679
chillers we're down to check it out

269
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:48,479
though check so you can see there's a

270
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:50,439
lot of work that goes into this for you

271
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,200
people that are watching this is not

272
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:55,480
something that you just go out on on a

273
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:57,000
whim this is a very intense

274
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:59,800
uh

275
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,720
large project so these are the the

276
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:04,919
condensers that are feeding the chillers

277
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,920
oh wow

278
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:15,040
careful yeah that'll do

279
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,040
it that'll do it for

280
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:21,639
sure then the the the the water tanks

281
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:24,600
yeah the glycol tanks the glycol tanks

282
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:24,600
ah the glycol

283
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,360
tanks the back here with all the tubes

284
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:34,480
oh wow so it's not it's not an enormous

285
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:35,879
amount no I mean that is it's it's a lot

286
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,360
but you'd think for the size of the

287
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:40,159
system that it could end up being a huge

288
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:44,278
piping too what is that like 8

289
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:47,838
in it's 8 in huh we justall that in your

290
00:11:44,278 --> 00:11:50,039
tent we did didn't we nice big pumps for

291
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:53,000
that and so did you guys have a special

292
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:54,439
company that come in and and do this or

293
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,360
did you guys this is this is all Hydro

294
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,639
inovation from Boulder Colorado they

295
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,480
came and did it all they came and did it

296
00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:04,240
all that's great

297
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:06,240
yeah let me turn this stuff on here it

298
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,919
up here hit the

299
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,360
switch that's some pretty serious uh

300
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:13,000
those are serious valves there's some

301
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:16,919
serious valves that sh and there one two

302
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:19,078
three before the actually ready no not

303
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:23,319
let's test it hey got clean Johnny look

304
00:12:19,078 --> 00:12:23,319
at the tea now that's nice

305
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:29,359
that's we nerd out on this stuff what

306
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,800
can we say yeah like hey thanks for

307
