1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,960
You know, I was going on a couple of

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:06,318
weeks ago about being of service to

3
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:08,638
other people. It's one of the real gifts

4
00:00:06,318 --> 00:00:10,320
that we get to have in this industry.

5
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:11,759
Um, is to make other people's lives

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,519
better.

7
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:18,960
years ago, I was up at the Gronigan Drug

8
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:20,679
Center for research and uh I went to the

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,920
hospital

10
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:26,960
there because my wife was getting a

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,118
liver transplant at the time and I ran

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,039
into

13
00:00:28,118 --> 00:00:33,880
a well, she wasn't a young lady, but a

14
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:37,640
middle-aged lady who

15
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:41,280
uh she saw me and understood that I was

16
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:44,079
there working with cannabis And uh she

17
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:48,320
says, "Can you get me some cannabis?"

18
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:52,558
Because uh she was uh she was dying of

19
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:55,280
uh pancreatic cancer, which is uh not

20
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:58,718
only really really difficult to beat,

21
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:02,239
but it's one of the most painful uh

22
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:05,159
deaths that uh can you you can go

23
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:08,280
through. And uh

24
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:11,280
so I mean my

25
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:13,359
company, we're breeding all these unique

26
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,560
varieties of cannabis and everything.

27
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:19,280
And what I did was I I found her some

28
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,560
cannabis the next day or two. I brought

29
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:25,439
it to her and uh you know a few days

30
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,240
later I saw she just says, "Oh, I want

31
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:30,399
to thank you." I says and I says, "Well,

32
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:33,359
you know, it's not going to be a cure."

33
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:39,280
and she goes, "Yes, but what it does is

34
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:43,680
it lifts my pain me above the pain." So,

35
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:47,439
I don't have the the pain uh you know,

36
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:52,640
just driving me down and uh so she was

37
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:55,398
able to uh you know uh lift her spirits

38
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,840
above the pain.

39
00:01:55,399 --> 00:02:02,560
And we as a company, we never dealt with

40
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:05,439
patients that much. We were a re medical

41
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:08,479
research and development company. But

42
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:14,759
what our end goal was was to because

43
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:18,360
this was uh uh in the early 90s was to

44
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:21,199
bring cannabis back into western

45
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:24,840
medicine because it was not there at

46
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:28,479
that time. And uh I I think we were very

47
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:32,640
successful at that which helped a lot of

48
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:32,639
patients further down the line.
