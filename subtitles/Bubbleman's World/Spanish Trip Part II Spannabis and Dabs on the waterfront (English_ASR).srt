52
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:30,360
Barcelona some good skateboard culture

53
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:32,840

00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,840

58
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,699
gift from some homie working for DNA

59
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:06,060
genetics

60
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:08,939
uh this is powered by secret society

61
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:10,978
hash Co our Terps don't lie so I'm not

62
00:05:08,939 --> 00:05:13,199
actually sure what the cultivar was on

63
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:14,758
this one uh it says it's two grams of

64
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,079
cold cure though so that's really nice

65
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:18,120
you could probably get a nice up close

66
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:19,079
there if you don't block out the sun I

67
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,180
don't know if you can go up there

68
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:23,519
without just putting holding the camera

69
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:26,100
close to it you can usually get a

70
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:28,379
can you go closer

71
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:31,699
great well let's take a little dab oh my

72
00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:35,399
goodness this is nice [ __ ] dude

73
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:37,400
oh God damn I'm actually excited for

74
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:40,439
this

75
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:42,239
what's crazy is that uh it is Barcelona

76
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:43,500
so you want to be safe

77
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,978
um you don't just want to kind of be

78
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:49,379
puffing anywhere in Barcelona but um

79
00:05:46,978 --> 00:05:51,959
it's a pretty kind of wealthy area where

80
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:53,879
people are doing pretty good and they're

81
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:55,198
a lot of skateboard culture hangs out

82
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:58,620
here

83
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:00,180
I've spent some time here before myself

84
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:02,100
so I'm pretty confident that I'll get

85
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:05,579
away with a couple of puffco or a couple

86
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:07,919
of card Puffs I did get a huge kick down

87
00:06:05,579 --> 00:06:10,019
today from puffco as well so I'll have

88
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:11,939
the puffco and the Carta going

89
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:13,978
toe-to-toe with one another and seeing

90
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:14,759
uh which ones I like and which times you

91
00:06:13,978 --> 00:06:17,038
know

92
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:19,740
with all these devices I find the best

93
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:21,599
one is the one that you need at the time

94
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:25,699
that you need it

95
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,699
so there we go quick little pup

96
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,418
yeah that's beautiful

like I said when you're in Spain

99
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:53,639
be careful be smart

100
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:56,939
you don't want to Puff too out in the

101
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:58,680
open it's not Amsterdam they do have a

102
00:06:56,939 --> 00:07:00,959
bit of a harsh belief system when it

103
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:04,759
comes to the police in particular so

104
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:04,758
be low-key and enjoy your vibes
