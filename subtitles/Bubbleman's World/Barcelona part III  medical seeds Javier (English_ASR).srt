not feminine this is the the first Trin

57
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:58,120

want the people select the more

59
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:04,319
different genotypes

60
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:08,518
uh and yeah exactly and I have the real

61
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:12,039
na case I have this clone 20 years ago

62
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:15,560
yes when it's the real case in ameran

63
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:20,439
it's a really difficult plant for grow

64
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:22,680
this 16 weeks going to say 18 16 16 16

65
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:25,840
but when you make six maybe it's a

66
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:28,840
little two weeks more sure but I cross

67
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:33,799
to deep chunk for cutting the the weeks

68
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:37,840
for cring CH yeah I I Tom Hill CH yeah

69
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:40,799
Tom Tom Tom Tom Hill he took Tom Hill

70
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:44,959
deep Chun yeah and he you selected

71
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:51,120
exactly I selected one man deep CH 10

72
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:54,560
years ago my is 6 years AG I deep chunk

73
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:58,719
Lev yeah and this is what this is yeah

74
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:02,759
and this is Jesus Christ open [ __ ] up

75
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:06,560
I three or four different genotypes uh

76
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:10,438
for example this is a nille this is the

77
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:13,840
name is a number three short in Spain

78
00:04:10,438 --> 00:04:16,959
Corto Corto okay yes and deep nville

79
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:19,439
strain three

80
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:23,280
large oh this is kind of fruity and

81
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:25,319
unique dang nerdy holy jeez that's uh

82
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:26,679
reminiscent of almost what I saw years

83
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:29,199
and years and years ago when they

84
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:31,800
claimed that there was the UBC chemo or

85
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:35,560
the BC Cho like the from like the

86
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:37,478
scientist or whatever very dark and like

87
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:40,000
when it when it when it dried it was

88
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:41,599
almost just like hash it's more you

89
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,360
couldn't really break it up you know

90
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,479
exactly so that's very nice to see so

91
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:51,280
that's deep devil

92
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:54,159
three yeah I'm my fa you have because

93
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:56,879
because I I like more of the cases too

94
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,360
when it's more longer it's more

95
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:01,560
sativa more you cut out that time you

96
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,759
cut out that time you lose that tpine

97
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:07,519
profile those flavors you know the tpin

98
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:11,319
it's the English word for the the

99
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:15,240
smells so if we go long with the hazes

100
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:16,959
we get those spice yeah yeah spice

101
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:20,038
perfume or

102
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:24,478
something acid a little bit

103
00:05:20,038 --> 00:05:27,439
acid absolutely and this is number 16 I

104
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:30,839
select because half so much crystal is

105
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:35,759
so fast and this was your Haze one

106

one yeah but this is a the same deep NY

107
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:41,280

more genotype meno genotype nice serious

161
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:18,039
meno I like the perf you're right

162
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:20,158
doesn't have a strong smell at

163
00:08:18,038 --> 00:08:22,478
all doesn't have a strong smell at all

164
00:08:20,158 --> 00:08:24,800
but definitely like decent purple herb

165
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:27,158
I'm not usually a huge fan of purple as

166
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,560

personal part which

171
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:42,640
is the water hash water has no the first

172
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:44,440

show us his extracts uh Javier does it

176
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:55,159
all he does seeds he does water hash he

177

181
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,559
next year I'm going to come you're going

the how is the

189
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:28,958
best different process for the strain

190
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:32,759
you know I make for example the IGA is a

191
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:37,479
a really good for S and because when I

192
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:40,759
make a Bo it's more wax that I prefer

193

me after I learn every different process

211
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:46,958

out if we have a screen of any sort

238
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,959
might have to drop a screen in there but

239
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:54,039

00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:13,599
I'll heat it up on the quartz and then

280
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:15,639
literally just like stick it in there

281
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,199

therapeutic mechanic instuction and

305
00:15:45,318 --> 00:15:51,799
that's where I and chemical extraction

306
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:54,879
solvents yes introduction um for

307
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:57,519
