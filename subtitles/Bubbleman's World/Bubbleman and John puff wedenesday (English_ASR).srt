171
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,720
I'm going to do

172
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:45,079
this for me when I open these up I just

173
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:47,520
kind of give it a little

174
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:50,399
squish that works out nice pull off

175
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:50,399
gently

176
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,680
yeah with this one here we do have a few

177
00:07:53,478 --> 00:07:57,199
with but we can actually pull those

178
00:07:54,680 --> 00:08:00,280
right through nicely and there we

179
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,598

00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:03,359
awesome just trying to get this little

181
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:07,839
hole opened up so

182
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:10,919

183
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:13,439
through want to there we

184
00:08:10,918 --> 00:08:16,639
go that's what I'm looking for right

185
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:19,519
there now for me I just do this move

186
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,519
some dirt off to the

187
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,720
side Lo

00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:27,000
in beautiful nice and easy I'm just

189
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:29,080
having the nightmare from hell with this

190
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,879
root mask but I got it oh but that's why

191
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:33,639
you have him in you did an awesome job

192
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:36,000
of it going to go the other way though I

193
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:38,439
like this flipping right down the other

194
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,440
way yeah well you know I don't want

195
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:44,440
that all right hi hello there look got

196
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:46,399
some nice trays look at these just came

197
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:48,519
in handy but did these come from the

198
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:51,480
airport by any chance sir uh yes those

199
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:52,480
were the two extra little ones there I

200
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,000
was looking for something today and I

201
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,000
was think well we didn't have any so I'm

202
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,759
just happy that's here it's beautiful

203
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,039
yeah very cool very cool

204
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:06,799
cool

205
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:08,399
so put that one aside c b so I'm going

206
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:11,000
to get him a little

207
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:13,360
straighter get him a little

208
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,200
straighter you know sometimes just how

209
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,839
you put a plant in a pot really will

210
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,240
affect the beginning of its growth and

211
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:21,480
of course it's very simple to train that

212
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:24,320
plant back to where you want it to go

213
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:28,120
but just personal choice I like to have

214
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,720
my plants uh you know

215
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:33,839
straight

216
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:35,079
all right so I guess next up PO me I'm

217
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:39,000
going to go Barbara and you're going to

218
00:09:35,078 --> 00:09:42,239
go Afghani woohoo we're not going up too

219
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,958
big on size from here about a gallon so

220
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,440
for me I'm going to put that much dirt

221
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:48,399
in yeah it's not going to be too much

222
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:51,120
we're going to mostly it'll be a base we

223
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:53,879
can put that right down on top that'll

224
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:57,039
be about perfect right

225
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:59,120
there okay so we're back after the dog

226
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:00,480
experience um going to do the trans

227
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,839
transplanting of the Barb and The

228
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,159
Afghani so I guess we'll both we've

229
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:07,079
already put a tiny little bit of uh soil

230
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:09,399
in the bottom of the pot I'd say I have

231
00:10:07,078 --> 00:10:12,958
maybe four or five in tops there you go

232
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:14,559
mainly because 2 in of this pot is um

233
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:17,278
actually

234
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:18,799
not let me see if I can reuse the

235
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:20,159
sticker that would sure be great I think

236
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:22,120
it's going to have some yeah prob going

237
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:24,078
to pop her there we go just like that

238
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:28,039
look at that look at that nice nice to

239
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:32,639
see The Roots going on upside down in we

240
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:35,000
go beautiful I'm with you on that one

241
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:35,000
here we

242
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:48,278
go and just fill up the

243
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:52,200
sides lightly just throw the dirt in

244
00:10:48,278 --> 00:10:54,519
there of water will do the rest for me

245
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,959
yep and the plants are definitely a

246
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:58,679
little moist which is nice yeah exactly

247
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:00,479
the soil so it won't need water right

248
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:03,439
away probably wait a you wouldn't really

249
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,159
want to transplant super dry plants the

250
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,760
dirt could start falling apart and it's

251
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:08,639
just I I find it a little bit easier to

252
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:11,519
have a bit of moisture in there for

253
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:13,519
sure not super wet that's for sure no

254
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,320
not super wet they got watered uh a

255
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,839
couple days

256
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:20,440
ago and I see how you water you water

257
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:22,279
very lightly you do quite a I water

258
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:24,279
lightly and great job of doing it and

259
00:11:22,278 --> 00:11:26,159
often like not super often but you know

260
00:11:24,278 --> 00:11:29,200
I like to let them I find if you just

261
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:32,078
water them too much they um they have a

262
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,079
hard time drying out

263
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:41,680
properly we G so there we go

264
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,959
with the bar now you notice when I did

265
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:45,919
that I put the sticker on the bucket

266
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:49,159
before I transplanted and before I put

267
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:51,278
the plant down I put the peg in the

268
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:54,078
strain one thing you'll never hear from

269
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:57,000
me is not knowing what strain I'm

270
00:11:54,078 --> 00:12:00,120
growing or what strain I have because

271
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:03,159
I'm obsessive with the name and the

272
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:04,639
labeling of the strain I I just I know

273
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:06,480
that it's it would be easy for me to put

274
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:09,720
this down and even mix these two plants

275
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,079
up in an instant which I do all the time

276
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,278
yeah it's so

277
00:12:11,078 --> 00:12:14,759
easy so we got those you got your

278
00:12:13,278 --> 00:12:16,799
sticker on that one and did you also put

279
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:19,879
the peg in there or did that get lost no

280
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:22,000
I think I think it actually um got lost

281
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:25,120
and I apologize I I took mine out and

282
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,799
put it put it somewhere here probably in

283
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,600
the

284
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:30,799
dirt I bet you when you dump the plant

285
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,920
it might have gone in the dirt but I uh

286
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:35,159
possibly no I don't think so we'll find

287
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:37,838
it or we'll use a new one we know it's

288
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:40,439
Afghani from the sticker on the side I

289
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:43,519
can't tell you enough label your plants

290
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:46,160
multiple times label your plants put a

291
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:49,639
little stick in the St in the in the mud

292
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:52,078
put a a um a sticker on the pot it's

293
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:53,680
it's everyone thinks they recognize

294
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:56,000
their plants and knows their plant so

295
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:57,559
well I say nothing better than having a

296
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
label on your plant so that when you

297
00:12:57,559 --> 00:13:02,518
share it or someone else get gets it

298
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,120
it's just easy um I mean Matt gave me

299
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:06,799
both of these uh all three of these

300
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:08,799
strains with labels uh double labels

301
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:11,559
sticker on the pot and a little piece

302
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:13,359
stuck into the into the into the dirt so

303
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:16,000
that's

304
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,639
definitely thing for yeah great idea

305
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,240
well just cuz these darn genetics right

306
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:21,039
they it's so easy to get them all mixed

307
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,278
up and people don't know what they have

308
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:24,439
and they don't know what this was and

309
00:13:22,278 --> 00:13:27,439
that was keep mine down to a m minimal

310
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:30,639
so at least I got an idea and well you

311
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:32,839
have idea you cuz right now my two my

312
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,959
denas and my number four I know they're

313
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:37,360
one of the

314
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:41,078
three oh oh no but the for someone like

315
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,560
myself um I I just I guess for me I just

316
00:13:41,078 --> 00:13:44,559
love I know what I have and I got an

317
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:46,078
idea and once I'm like hm well this is

318
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:47,319
something uh it's going to be a new

319
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:48,638
surprise cuz I can't remember what it

320
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,199
was well that's what John and I are all

321
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,560
about sh sharing with you too is that

322
00:13:50,198 --> 00:13:53,319
we're different people and we have

323
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:56,239
different ways and so we're just telling

324
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:57,680
our ways for the people that would um

325
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,079
have things in common with us and

326
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:00,519
there's many other different way ways to

327
00:13:59,078 --> 00:14:02,078
do this these are just a couple of

328
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:03,198
different ways that that we're doing it

329
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:04,719
the most important thing I always say to

330
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:06,838
myself I damn I should have labeled it

331
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,079
and hence you know what I mean yeah I'm

332
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:10,680
obsessive with I'm okay I need label my

333
00:14:09,078 --> 00:14:12,599
next one so I have already I want to get

334
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:14,039
that Afghani label I really want to find

335
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,040
it oh we're going to get it and get it

336
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:18,159
in the in the yeah because it definitely

337
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:20,078
didn't go in the soil because it no I I

338
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:21,919
didn't put it in this soil either but uh

339
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:23,559
it is a small little label that could be

340
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:26,399
I'll find it one day and laugh it's

341
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:29,119
right around me I'll be like got it John

342
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:31,399
I found it oh wait a second see this is

343
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,399
how it

344
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:35,879
happens anyway we're going to uh

345
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:38,399
probably end up I guess we'll water

346
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:39,799
these plants and then a little later on

347
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,839
we're going to take a couple of clones

348
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:45,039
off The Afghani and the Barb and uh nice

349
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:48,279
send John home with those once our sweet

350
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:50,679
skunks get a little bit older I'd say

351
00:14:48,278 --> 00:14:52,320
maybe two or 3 weeks nice once they're

352
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:54,679
growing nice and we've got them up to

353
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,040
sort of this style you can come take a

354
00:14:54,679 --> 00:14:57,479
bunch of cuts of those too and that's

355
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:59,078
going to be beautiful for my summertime

356
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,519
one because of the sweet in the skunk

357
00:14:59,078 --> 00:15:02,239
and they're get more of an outdoor look

358
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:04,919
at the little tiny leaves how it almost

359
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,560
looks like a Bonsai I love how it's like

360
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:08,399
the I mean you just see how M worked on

361
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:09,919
the perfect clones here right just like

362
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,399
right from the start you see how he's

363
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:14,198
branched them out so they be main moms I

364
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,600
like it how he's done here you know it's

365
00:15:14,198 --> 00:15:18,120
beautiful I see it with your name on it

366
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,800
right over there that's beautiful I see

367
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:22,120
it right from here John he's going to

368
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:23,719
give it to me yeah well I'm going to

369
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:25,560
pass it on I you know it's just I don't

370
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:27,600
even feel oh I want say you know what

371
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:30,919
yeah that's it's it's a nice thing to be

372
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:34,920
able to uh actually enjoy um what we

373
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:36,559
love so much absolutely man so we can't

374
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:39,039
send them in the mail and we were not

375
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:41,039
you know if uh no these ones are are

376
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:43,599
here at a legal grow and they are going

377
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:44,838
to stay here at a legal grow so yeah a

378
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,720
lot of people going to be say hey can

379
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:47,720
you send me that

380
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,799
andem I I offer the strains to my

381
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,800
friends with

382
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:55,519
licenses and that's and that's who I

383
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:56,359
offer it to and I hope that eventually I

384
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,679
get these

385
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:00,318
strains you know I know Matt's got his

386
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:02,120
strains so you can buy them in seed form

387
00:16:00,318 --> 00:16:03,919
that's great that's awesome I'm into

388
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:05,399
getting strains to breeders I'm into to

389
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:06,838
people working with these strains I

390
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:08,159
can't wait to pass the sweet skunk

391
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,639
around to a couple breeder friends of

392
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:12,799
mine I might send it to Javier at

393
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:14,759
Medical seeds in Barcelona um Phil from

394
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:17,479
True genetics up in Whistler wants to

395
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:19,240
play around with it it's a nice thing to

396
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:21,319
let them play around with it and it's

397
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,799
it's an ideal thing I know some people

398
00:16:21,318 --> 00:16:24,719
think that the Jean Pool will be

399
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:26,639
destroyed but you know as long as we

400
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,639
keep the originals they'll be fine the

401
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:31,720
difference in the Lea P see it's just

402
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:34,399
structure and that's like like you know

403
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:36,360
for me that I I really pay attention to

404
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,120
the serration and Lea patterns and stuff

405
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,560
like that because it gives me how to

406
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,078
identify a lot of the strains and how

407
00:16:39,559 --> 00:16:43,078
they grow so I am able to see the

408
00:16:41,078 --> 00:16:45,439
different genetics and see how things

409
00:16:43,078 --> 00:16:47,198
actually I mean beautiful five we' just

410
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,240
yeah you know what I'm excited why don't

411
00:16:47,198 --> 00:16:51,159
we go mix up a batch of Med One show

412
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:52,799
them how simple that is and then we'll

413
00:16:51,159 --> 00:16:54,439
give these guys a little water we should

414
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:57,078
do that and then flush out we'll give

415
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,680
some water uh clean water non food to

416
00:16:57,078 --> 00:17:00,599
the uh Blooming Garden as well we'll

417
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:02,559
show you a little bit of that took a few

418
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,439
of the shots macro shots of that medy

419
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:07,078
kush

420
00:17:03,438 --> 00:17:09,000
today that was nice just looked so clean

421
00:17:07,078 --> 00:17:11,558
and untouched yeah cuz you never touched

422
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,759
it yeah they just looked like Perfection

423
00:17:11,558 --> 00:17:15,399
just I I'm I can't wait to share with

424
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:17,519
you guys the string definitely produces

425
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:19,160
some nice resin as I've seen from John's

426
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:22,000
grow I just I've never been able to

427
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:24,798
shoot it whenever I want yeah you know

428
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,679
what the live and and seeing that live

429
00:17:24,798 --> 00:17:28,199
plant resin is actually like I've seen

430
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:29,000
the shot you done with Remo and stuff

431
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:30,480
like that

432
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
just beautiful seeing that development

433
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,360
and how it is on when the plan is

434
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,319
untouched you can actually take a good

435
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:37,839
close look like I mean your picture is

436
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:39,759
phenomenal but I mean being able to

437
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:41,839
really take a look at it and then

438
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:43,400
understand what we're actually really

439
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:44,879
trying to get into that's a huge part of

440
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,320
our education John it's it's the

441

medicine you know but but the

442
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:50,480
photography the the detailed macro

443
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:53,240
photography is a huge part of our

444
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:55,200
education um it's it's well for me it's

445
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,839
being the next step yeah absolutely me

446
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,840
too and I've you know been playing

447
00:17:56,839 --> 00:18:00,839
around with it since 2008 and it's been

448
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:02,399
growing and and each year becoming a

this is yours and this is uh 15

488
00:19:26,919 --> 00:19:30,440
milliliters one

489
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,759
one

490
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:34,558
tablespoon nice looks so killer coming

491
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:37,038
in last time I grew I was growing with

492
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:40,200
Earth Juice probably 15 16 even 17 years

493
00:19:37,038 --> 00:19:44,079
ago it's been a while so uh the same

494
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:46,240
smell that guano wish kelpy just

495
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:48,119
awesomeness and of course I um brought

496
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,839
you some uh ph up and this is probably

497
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:51,359
enough to last in for about probably 3

498
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:52,959
years to give you a little bit of an

499
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:56,319
idea the water comes out of the tap here

500
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:59,240
at an 8ph oh really we just put the med

501
00:19:56,319 --> 00:20:02,000
one in okay and that well maybe even

502
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:05,558
seven seven 7 point something um we just

503
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,839
put the med one in to that 7 to8 pH

504
00:20:05,558 --> 00:20:11,839
water and that brought us down I'd say

505
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:15,720
it's going to be about 3.2 um right now

506
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:18,798
it's at 3.5 it's holding around 3.4 3.3

507
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:21,159
yeah for me I get 3.7 at my house 3.3

508
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:24,000
and and already Mark is now dialing in

509
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:25,840
his 32 that's awesome he knows exactly

510
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,240
what it is so I mean for me at this

511
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:29,279
point I'm going to step back because

512
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,599
he's already dialed then what you do you

513
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:32,038
know what I mean yeah and it took you

514
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:33,639
know it didn't take very long like it's

515
00:20:32,038 --> 00:20:35,879
a very simple system John showed me how

516
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:38,120
to do it just basically dial the put it

517
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:40,760
the tinest little bit of pH up I've got

518
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:42,479
uh a half teaspoon here which is 2.5

519
00:20:40,759 --> 00:20:44,359
milliliters and I won't even use that

520
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,120
much I'll actually see how much you're

521
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:47,879
using there you can see how he's uh I

522
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:49,119
can already see the the indent side he's

523
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,000
already got like a small measurement

524
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:52,599
that he keeps using and it looks like

525
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,798
youve got it dialed in my friend well

526
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:58,798
you know what I often will I'd rather go

527
00:20:55,798 --> 00:21:01,639
slow because I don't have any pH down

528
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:04,079
yeah so there's we don't want to go over

529
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:07,600
PH down and then water down I've had to

530
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:09,119
do it so many times yeah but happen it

531
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:11,399
can happen but it's such a pain in the

532
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:13,558
butt oh huge I'd rather have uh so this

533
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:17,440
will probably take me up to about five

534
00:21:13,558 --> 00:21:18,720
maybe 5.2 no it's still 4.5 so it's slow

535
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,400
I'm going to put probably the same

536
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,880
amount in there and of course we're

537
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,278
looking for a 6.2 to a 6.8 that's the

538
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,200
pretty much IDE pretty much what

539
00:21:25,278 --> 00:21:28,720
everybody kind of aims for it's the

540
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,120
ideal neut

541
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,600
uptake

542
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:36,278
pH so we'll KCK a little bit more of

543
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:38,399
that out a little more more I probably

544
00:21:36,278 --> 00:21:40,839
still haven't put a full one of these in

545
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,600
you can put a full one in and nail it

546
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:45,158
but if you go over the tiniest little

547
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:47,199
bit I'll tell you it takes forever to

548
00:21:45,159 --> 00:21:49,559
get up to the right time amount

549
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,720
sometimes but one drop brings it up like

550
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:53,519
four points or something how did that

551
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:56,278
happen I don't know you know what so for

552
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:58,480
me the fun on my water I I my water

553
00:21:56,278 --> 00:22:00,200
comes out of the top at 63 uh I

554
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:03,640
shouldn't say out of the top my

555
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:06,120
rainwater sometimes and out of the de um

556
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:08,240
sometimes I get 5'6 sometimes I get 62

557
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:11,000
oh yeah but I get I get an average of 50

558
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:14,640
Ms of Med One to 1 mil of pH take that

559
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:17,319
6.1 6.2 you've nailed it and he roughly

560
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:19,600
about a me in a bit there yeah yeah so

561
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:24,000
we've got our food it's mixed it's

562
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:28,038
simple um we went 15 MLS which um for

563
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:30,200
medy 1 week one you can go as low as 2.5

564
00:22:28,038 --> 00:22:33,240
Mills per liter which is basically we

565
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:34,400
put in about double that but these

566
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,919
plants

567
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:39,038
here as well as these ones they've been

568
00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:41,960
growing for over a week so we can start

569
00:22:39,038 --> 00:22:44,599
in at the two week point for oh this is

570
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:46,600
what I I've been doing for um for years

571
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:49,918
I've been using med1 since 2010 I

572
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:51,639
started doing the testing on it and a

573
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,919
buddy you know what this is how I do

574
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,559
things this what works for the strands

575
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:56,440
that I know that work here sure

576
00:22:54,558 --> 00:22:58,639
everybody really needs to pay attention

577
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:01,240
to how how you know some people burn

578
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:04,080
their plants um you know what I always

579
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:06,960
just take my time um I I don't feed too

580
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:08,319
heavy I uh I take my time just like

581
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,720
Mark's doing here he's got his whole

582
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:11,558
little watering techniques and how he

583
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:13,240
wants to do things and everybody's got

584
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:14,839
everybody's got their little techniqu do

585
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:17,359
it the way you want to do it that's the

586
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:20,119
coolest thing because it's your little

587
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:22,119
thing and it's your it's your it's it's

588
00:23:20,119 --> 00:23:24,359
it's your medicine it's your growth you

589
00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:25,759
got like these four five plants oh man

590
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:28,359
how are you going to let anyone tell you

591
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:30,839
anything you can listen to ideas and

592
00:23:28,359 --> 00:23:33,399
Concepts and here you go buddy you want

593
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:34,759
to give those guys a couple of shots

594
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,840
these are bigger plants they could

595
00:23:34,759 --> 00:23:38,720
probably even use another feeding but uh

596
00:23:36,839 --> 00:23:40,639
these ons are quite small with a small

597
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,038
root mass so I think the amount of water

598
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,400
I gave them will be more than enough

599
00:23:42,038 --> 00:23:45,558
probably about 600 milliliters little

600
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,360
bit under a

601
00:23:45,558 --> 00:23:51,599
liter and uh John's just doing up the

602
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:54,000
Barb or no The Afghani sorry these were

603
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:54,000
the sweet

604
00:23:54,839 --> 00:23:59,519
skunks and last but certain enough not

605
00:23:58,038 --> 00:24:01,480
least if you want to slide that over

606
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:04,079
going to slide this over here pull this

607
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:05,558
one towards me and as I turn I was cuz

608
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:07,158
the all the dirt was on the side and the

609
00:24:05,558 --> 00:24:09,158
moisture was already there so I was just

610
00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:11,039
kind of feeding the do it your way do it

611
00:24:09,159 --> 00:24:13,919
the way you like it yeah this is I'm

612
00:24:11,038 --> 00:24:15,319
very into uh feeding right down on top

613
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,559
of the stock but at the same time you

614
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:18,879
don't want to do that all the time or

615
00:24:16,558 --> 00:24:21,599
you can end up with a bit of uh stock

616
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,840
rot Remo was really uh showing me about

617
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:25,599
that with his big plants yeah it's it's

618
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:28,079
not as big of a Devastator on the small

619
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:30,199
plants but a big plant basically you get

620
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:32,558
a little bit of that and uh it ends up

621
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:35,360
locking up the root system and he can

622
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:37,038
lose an entire plant so what I did there

623
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:38,798
is cuz the P the plant went right in the

624
00:24:37,038 --> 00:24:40,839
center and it had that little one in

625
00:24:38,798 --> 00:24:42,879
wide there I think we got for me did

626
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:44,759
that the roots are all right there so it

627
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,320
just dri down to the outside yeah just

628
00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:47,679
touching those roots and taking up the

629
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:49,200
uptake and these are going to so many

630
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:51,240
different ways the funny thing about

631
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,240
watering cannabis is you'll see like we

632
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:55,440
didn't even plan this did you notice he

633
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:57,359
watered it exactly the opposite way or I

634
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,320
watered it exactly the opposite way of

635
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:01,599
him if we were working together and

636
00:24:59,319 --> 00:25:03,599
trying to grow together that would

637
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:06,798
basically divide our friendship and

638
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:09,158
because Growers have to do it their way

639
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:11,398
you all know you do you're all the same

640
00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:13,720
way you have to do it so why we're going

641
00:25:11,398 --> 00:25:15,239
to do it our way so I'm going to water

642
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:17,319
in the center John's going to water on

643
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:19,000
the outside and geez I bet you there's

644
00:25:17,319 --> 00:25:20,759
100 other guys watering a hundred other

645
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,200
different ways I I would definitely

646
00:25:20,759 --> 00:25:23,798
water in Cent when I'm going the smaller

647
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,919
plant I was looking at the bigger plant

648
00:25:23,798 --> 00:25:27,278
so there's reasons for why I did this of

649
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,360
course we have different plants we have

650
00:25:27,278 --> 00:25:29,720
different

651
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:33,158
that's the wonderful thing about growing

652
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:35,960
Canabis you can grow any way you want

653
00:25:33,159 --> 00:25:38,520
and in the end resin talks so if you're

654
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:39,798
producing full melt resin and people are

655
00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:41,759
telling you that you need to change the

656
00:25:39,798 --> 00:25:43,319
way you're doing things but they

657
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:45,798
themselves are not producing full melt

658
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:47,879
resin you should avoid listening to

659
00:25:45,798 --> 00:25:50,720
anything that they have to

660
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:52,360
say I listen to John and I listen to his

661
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:55,038
tips because he's producing full melt

662
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:56,558
resin you know and I haven't grown in 20

663
00:25:55,038 --> 00:25:59,038
years although I have to admit I'm

664
00:25:56,558 --> 00:26:01,558
feeling like I know what what I'm doing

665
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:03,200
that you should take we should take take

666
00:26:01,558 --> 00:26:06,759
them inside and take a look at you

667
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:09,440

five and a half weeks I I don't even

679
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:34,440
know you know I think they've been

680
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:35,918
flowering for maybe four four and a bit

681
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:38,159
well they're looking amazing my friend

682

definitely you know avoiding new burns

686
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,319
on the tips I guess there's a little

687
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:50,440
yellow right there I know that would be

688
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:52,599
the you're starting to not feed the well

689
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,960
that's that's exactly it so now they're

690
00:26:52,599 --> 00:26:56,599
starting to Autumn off and we're going

691
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:59,120
to start getting some uh you

692
00:26:56,599 --> 00:27:01,839
know definitely uh the watermelon is

693
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:04,558
looking amazing yeah that looks

694
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:06,480
great really nice resin production here

695
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:09,359
uh underneath here we have the medic

696
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:12,159
Kush wow which is looking absolutely

697
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:16,079
spectacular as well just greasing right

698
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:17,840
up real nice living resin behind there

699
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:20,278
yeah Bubba cam right in behind there

700
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:23,558
kind of uh growing up

701
00:27:20,278 --> 00:27:26,278
almost almost leafing out again kind of

702
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:28,038
stretching those buds out yeah I guess

703
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:29,960
it's the style of the Nugget cuz I've

704
00:27:28,038 --> 00:27:32,679
definitely been avoiding all light in

705
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:34,919
this tunnel or in this uh tunnel in this

706
00:27:32,679 --> 00:27:37,159
uh T little tent We Got My Little Pony

707
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:38,440
in the background now she's way behind

708
00:27:37,159 --> 00:27:40,399
the rest of these guys because she's

709
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:42,840
going to flower for weeks more so her

710
00:27:40,398 --> 00:27:44,359
resin production is not really on point

711
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:47,720
just yet compared to the rest of the

712
00:27:44,359 --> 00:27:50,398
plants but she has a long way to go you

713
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:53,600

854
00:33:42,278 --> 00:33:46,240
happening we're just so backed up but um

855
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:47,959
we're just not running out of resin it's

856
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,399
not needed right now but I'm sure when

857
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:53,329
the time gets close we'll definitely be

858
00:33:49,398 --> 00:33:55,959

859
00:33:53,329 --> 00:33:58,960
[Music]

860

budos

861
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:06,000
oh

862
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:08,599
yeah one thing about the Dil is it

863
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,239
really sort of trains you to hit a bong

864
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:14,399
differently if you hit it like a beine

865
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:16,239
RI and you'll there's a lot of the hit

866
00:34:14,398 --> 00:34:19,078
that's still there I find it's taking me

867
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:21,358
a while to train myself to do this long

868
00:34:19,079 --> 00:34:25,480
slow sort of

869
00:34:21,358 --> 00:34:28,119
haul so as you saw I was trying to do

870
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:30,398
small ones but Mark always here likes

871
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:32,159
that hit me hard let's go big let's go

872
00:34:30,398 --> 00:34:34,559
big so now it's my turn let's go big now

873
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:36,320
you're going for the 90 fresh frozen

874
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:38,279

cleaner mine's a little warm though I

877
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:45,838
just cool it down right on the on the

878
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:48,358
stone just for a second the sift is not

879
00:34:45,838 --> 00:34:52,918
a friend nor is the full melt bubble to

880
00:34:48,358 --> 00:34:55,199
um a warm metal Skillet tool here we go

881
00:34:52,918 --> 00:34:58,000
and see some clones on here with your

882
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:59,399
name on them John

883
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,960
and you'll be seeing those grow in my

884
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:03,960
garden too yeah you will there you go

885
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:11,639
ready kind started bubbling on top of

886
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:17,320
the that was amazing the way it

887
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:22,319
dissipated

888
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:24,680
yeah oh that is the 90th boom isn't it

889
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:27,440
yeah that's so nice and uh that's why it

890
00:35:24,679 --> 00:35:28,879
hits almost sift like

891
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:32,159
there's no one on God's green earth that

892
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:34,400
could deny it looks like Sif the TP

893
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:38,000
Factor on that

894
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:39,400
resin but it doesn't it's different I

895
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,079
guarantee if we had the same well let's

896
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:44,358
do it let's make sift from my watermelon

897
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:47,720

00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,440
see this one here I'm going to show the

971
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,400
which one here so on the inside here

972
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:56,039
this one on the inside here you see this

973
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,599
one's coming in so these that's the one

974
00:38:56,039 --> 00:38:59,318
I was looking at this one here is going

975
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:01,400
to cause a problem in a sense in the

976
00:38:59,318 --> 00:39:03,519
future but we'll make an amazing big

977
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,880
clone beautiful clone and what I was

978
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:07,119
doing before what I showed you on my

979
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:08,358
channels my it would be okay if I peel

980
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:10,358
would you like me to just cut right

981
00:39:08,358 --> 00:39:11,759
below that you do whatever you like it's

982
00:39:10,358 --> 00:39:12,920
a pretty big Branch so you definitely

983
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:15,760
don't want to leave too big of an

984
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:17,280
exposure there so what I'm looking here

985
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,800
yeah leave maybe one growth sight is I

986
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:21,839
can leave these two growth sites and I'm

987
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:23,359
going to cut nice big long stem nice big

988
00:39:21,838 --> 00:39:26,078
long stem straight

989
00:39:23,358 --> 00:39:28,440
across and then I'm going to cut it on a

990
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:28,440
45

991
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:38,280
five and there's your B and there's my

992
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:41,318
V Barbara and Afghan I'm super stoked

993
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:42,480
dude dude yeah it's awesome thanks Matt

994
00:39:41,318 --> 00:39:44,358
thanks Matt we couldn't have done this

995
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,358
without you buddy you were the beginning

996
00:39:44,358 --> 00:39:47,679
of this circle and we're going to follow

997
00:39:46,358 --> 00:39:49,279
this around and we're going to see how

998
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:50,960
far it goes I want to give him a number

999
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,720
four yeah well you will give them a

1000
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,838
number four we're all this is exciting

1001
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:56,439
once you start sharing strains that's

1002
00:39:54,838 --> 00:39:59,279
the energy that you start falling into

1003
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:01,440
into this energy oh the cat's chasing

1004
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,960
the dog interesting so you know what

1005
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,599
they're having some fun today but they

1006
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:08,240
are you having fun buddy he's like come

1007
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:11,440
right here you chasing the

1008
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:13,559
cat that's the best thing about life

1009
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:16,000
okay leave the cat alone yes leave the

1010
00:40:13,559 --> 00:40:19,358
cat alone all right so we took a couple

1011
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:22,440
of clones the cycle put the mosquito on

1012
00:40:19,358 --> 00:40:24,759
man is he a big mosquit look at that wow

1013
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:27,400
I I that would be a shot right there

1014
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:30,000
that would be a wish I had my macro lens

1015
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:32,200
cuz Al you move too close to that guy oh

1016
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,880
no he's not moving he's happy I should

1017
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:36,480
run and get my macro lens it's a huge

1018
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:38,400
monster mosquito just I think he's going

1019
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:41,599
to sit there I think he's going to sit

1020
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:44,039
there very cool let's hit up yeah I

1021
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:47,480
think we should we've taking a clone and

1022
00:40:44,039 --> 00:40:50,480
uh each oh you got Barb don't you I have

1023
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:52,400
Barb somewhere I put Barb in my pocket

1024
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:55,199
look at that so we're going to hit some

1025
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:56,960
Barb and some Afghani now you know what

1026
00:40:55,199 --> 00:40:58,639
I think we have

1027
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:02,800
that might

1028
00:40:58,639 --> 00:41:05,000
be yes yes that's Barb right there well

1029
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,240
Afghani we have to go hunt down well

1030
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,519
we're going to hit the Barb CU we just

1031
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:10,279
cut her yes I think it's it's a must

1032
00:41:08,519 --> 00:41:13,280
that we I think it is yeah it's a

1033
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:15,040
wonderful thing is it you up or me I

1034
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:17,000
think it's you I saw the size of that so

1035
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:20,440
I'm going to go it's his

1036
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:24,280
turn all right then I'll take it never

1037
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:24,280
pull a dab you wouldn't take for

1038
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:28,239
yourself

1039
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,960
beautiful meltt and that's the best part

1040
00:41:31,639 --> 00:41:34,159
about the bar I'm really looking forward

1041
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,639
to Growing it and of course I'm going to

1042
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:38,799
use my feeding program I'm going to use

1043
00:41:35,639 --> 00:41:41,199
Med one that's it and

1044
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:43,640
um yeah massive actually no I use

1045
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:45,439
massive sometimes depending how I feel

1046
00:41:43,639 --> 00:41:47,239
but I'm definitely going to grow her my

1047
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,880
way and uh we're going to be smoking her

1048
00:41:47,239 --> 00:41:51,039
and uh I'm going to say about four

1049
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:52,760
months cuz I like to uh do my little way

1050
00:41:51,039 --> 00:41:55,519
and I like to hang

1051
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:56,880
and I think it's a 60-day strain I don't

1052
00:41:55,519 --> 00:41:58,239
even know I have to I'd like to know

1053
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,680
exactly well I'll take it how long that

1054
00:41:58,239 --> 00:42:02,118
I feel it's ready where uh I like to

1055
00:42:00,679 --> 00:42:04,199
stretch things and take things to their

1056
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:07,280
LM you know what's interesting since I

1057
00:42:04,199 --> 00:42:11,919
started growing again after 20

1058
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:15,319
years um is that I'm not really I I like

1059
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:17,000
the idea of a generalization but so far

1060
00:42:15,318 --> 00:42:19,039
like Matt gave me these strains I didn't

1061
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,679
even ask how long you would flower them

1062
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:24,039
for I'll flower them for as long as I

1063
00:42:21,679 --> 00:42:26,399
want to flower them for I'll grow them

1064
00:42:24,039 --> 00:42:28,719
I'll watch them I'll photograph them and

1065
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,880
I'll decide when they're ready to be cut

1066
00:42:28,719 --> 00:42:32,159
down everyone's different and I think

1067
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:34,838
that's a great way to go you don't have

1068
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:37,399
to let anyone tell you when the best day

1069
00:42:34,838 --> 00:42:40,119
uh to cut a strain down is cuz it's

1070
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:42,200
really giving up a lot you've you know

1071
00:42:40,119 --> 00:42:44,440
you've already maybe potentially uh

1072
00:42:42,199 --> 00:42:45,879
given up the person choosing a selection

1073
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:48,800
or a

1074
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:50,920
phenotype we've already given up so much

1075
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,000
I'm happy to grow people's the the work

1076
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:54,480
that people have

1077
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,639
done but I'm definitely not given that

1078
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:58,358
last uh well I do think things different

1079
00:42:56,639 --> 00:43:00,719
like I mean like we did in the last we I

1080
00:42:58,358 --> 00:43:03,078
cut all my bottoms we made made some

1081
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:04,480
beautiful beautiful [ __ ] fresh frosen

1082
00:43:03,079 --> 00:43:05,800
with it I've let it go for another

1083
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:07,199
couple more weeks and I'm going to take

1084
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,720
those tops that's what I'm going to do

1085
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:09,799
too yeah that's what you know what and

1086
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:12,358
when you said this and I was like you

1087
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:14,318
know what I'm doing this I think I think

1088
00:43:12,358 --> 00:43:17,318
you said it and I just just went and did

1089
00:43:14,318 --> 00:43:19,599
it I like that makes sense or I've been

1090
00:43:17,318 --> 00:43:20,880
doing it or I just I just you know what

1091
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:23,039
well all of a sudden those resin glands

1092
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:24,720
have access to the light they're already

1093
00:43:23,039 --> 00:43:27,480
there they've just H they haven't

1094
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:29,759
fruited out oh you we don't care how

1095
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:31,599
much bigger the buds get that's not what

1096
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:33,440
we're trying to attempt to do TR we're

1097
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:35,240
trying to get resin we want to Sugar out

1098
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:38,240
the resin we want to mature the resin

1099
00:43:35,239 --> 00:43:40,879
and we want that resin to be just melty

1100
00:43:38,239 --> 00:43:43,159
yeah melty and awesome so definitely has

1101
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:46,358
to melt you know what

1102
00:43:43,159 --> 00:43:48,598
um that's the key yeah

1103
00:43:46,358 --> 00:43:50,159
absolutely I'm going to go find the afan

1104
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:53,640
all yeah

1105
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:57,000
yep and of course the Afghani we've hit

1106
00:43:53,639 --> 00:43:59,440
the Barb let's hit the Afghani

1107
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,920
the two we just cut oh look at how that

1108
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:05,079
is in there that's it's cream this is so

1109

1111
00:44:07,318 --> 00:44:11,920

1112
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:14,199
is so funny and I'm slightly baked oh

1113
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:17,720
that also just melts away to nothingness

1114
00:44:14,199 --> 00:44:23,159
