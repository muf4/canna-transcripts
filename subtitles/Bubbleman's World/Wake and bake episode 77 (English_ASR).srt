1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:06,060
hey what's up everybody welcome to the

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:08,220
wake and bake episode 77 that's seven

3
00:00:06,059 --> 00:00:10,079
and seven it's a palindrome actually

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,030
forwards and backwards and anyway I hope

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,219
everyone's doing great today we're just

6
00:00:12,029 --> 00:00:18,149
in the chatroom talking with sticks with

7
00:00:14,218 --> 00:00:20,009
turps Scott ray Detroit Bubble Boy we're

8
00:00:18,149 --> 00:00:22,349
talking about the cost of hash we're

9
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:24,240
talking about you know trying to get

10
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:27,269
bubbleman Brad really wants to get the

11
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:29,038
price of hash down in California it's

12
00:00:27,268 --> 00:00:30,989
hard because the shops you sell to

13
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,710
obviously are doubling the prices on the

14
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:36,359
hash and you see these extravagant over

15
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:39,480
a hundred dollars sometimes over two

16
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:41,700
hundred dollar prices which that's a

17
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:43,199
little bit of a kick in the a little bit

18
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,570
of a kick in the newts for someone

19
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:49,200
especially if this is your your your

20
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:50,939
medicine that you're purchasing I agree

21
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55,320
demand amide the rent is too damn high

22
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:57,149
and the hash is too damn high hope

23
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,219
everyone's good I can't seem to get this

24
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:02,429
working but it seems like we're on live

25
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:04,829
here my YouTube video won't go live on

26
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:08,340
my computer but I see you guys so

27
00:01:04,829 --> 00:01:10,438
obviously you can see me yeah rocking a

28
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,210
little DNA always happy to support Erin

29
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:14,309
and Dawn and of course Crockett good

30
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:17,069
people good people haven't seen him for

31
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:20,659
a while I gotta say last time I saw Erin

32
00:01:17,069 --> 00:01:23,279
was probably when he was out here for

33
00:01:20,659 --> 00:01:25,729
New Year's came out for New Year's with

34
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:29,159
his family and we hung out with him and

35
00:01:25,728 --> 00:01:30,868
as well as flat 41 and his family and

36
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:32,579
even the great gardener was up with his

37
00:01:30,868 --> 00:01:34,078
girlfriend Sarah that was Whistler

38
00:01:32,578 --> 00:01:37,529
there's videos you guys could go check

39
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:39,269
it out I just don't get why it won't

40
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:42,868
show me not that I really need to as

41
00:01:39,269 --> 00:01:43,879
long as I can see the the chat then

42
00:01:42,868 --> 00:01:46,978
we're good to go

43
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:49,199
right now it's 9:30 I don't stream at

44
00:01:46,978 --> 00:01:51,060
any particular time Gavin I go when I

45
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,829
want to go I like to build up the room a

46
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,390
little bit have you guys sitting in here

47
00:01:52,828 --> 00:01:56,419
and chatting and creating a conversation

48
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:59,099
that always seems to be a great way

49
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:00,780
let's hope for 2017 to be the year that

50
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:02,339
we see the prices of hash go down a

51
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:05,159
little bit it would be really really

52
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:08,909
nice to see I'm gonna turn on the dab

53
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:11,670

less bro well you know what Nick it's

60

I'm not trying to direct you any one way

62
00:02:26,769 --> 00:02:31,750
but I have my own directions and I'm

63
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:34,568
passionate about them and hey what's

64
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:37,060

while buddy nice - nice to see you

I hope life is treating you well I'm

68
00:02:41,968 --> 00:02:46,329
probably gonna rip into some of this dry

69
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:48,548
sift or some of this dry sift I'm not

70
00:02:46,329 --> 00:02:52,090
too sure this one's D for 20k it's a

71
00:02:48,549 --> 00:02:56,799
little bit darker oh gee cush this one

72
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:58,780
is from the guys that sunrise wellness

73
00:02:56,799 --> 00:03:00,938
and I can't remember the name of it

74
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:02,799
right now it's it's definitely not the

75
00:03:00,938 --> 00:03:05,049
petróleo head stache cross with the

76
00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:06,419
malawi that was just the jar that he

77
00:03:05,049 --> 00:03:08,950
gave it to me

78
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:10,209
all right i will go for the light one I

79
00:03:08,949 --> 00:03:11,768
will go for the light when it's funny

80
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:13,120
because you know Tony said something the

81
00:03:11,769 --> 00:03:15,209
other day when he was talking to someone

82
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,009
about rosin and there is sort of this

83
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:20,049
minor negative attention that gets put

84
00:03:18,009 --> 00:03:23,289
on the darker resins and I'm not sure

85
00:03:20,049 --> 00:03:25,180
why that is I as well love clear golden

86
00:03:23,289 --> 00:03:29,318
as light colored as possible it just

87
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:31,060
seems to have something that is more and

88
00:03:29,318 --> 00:03:33,339
I when it's when it comes out darker I

89
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:35,530
just feel like it's not quite as good

90
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:37,930
and I'm not sure why that is it's

91
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:41,229
definitely a weird thing I'm not trying

92
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:45,400
to be hash racist that's for sure but I

93
00:03:41,229 --> 00:03:47,489
do prefer a golden a golden color all

94
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:50,349
right let's grab a little dabble here

95
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:52,359
it's aesthetically pleasing it's an I

96
00:03:50,348 --> 00:03:54,939
don't think it's Oh 9 cookies for some

97
00:03:52,359 --> 00:03:57,900
reason but maybe it is I really kind of

98
00:03:54,939 --> 00:03:59,169
forgot maybe it is the oh 9 cookies I

99
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:02,650
forget

100
00:03:59,169 --> 00:04:04,090
oh nice heavy ice what I would love to

101
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:05,620
see that and I've had some delicious

102
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:08,408
dark rosin don't get me wrong but for

103
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:12,158
the most part I'm usually a little bit

104
00:04:08,408 --> 00:04:13,388
happier when it comes out well you know

105
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:15,400
what I mean we're talking about color

106
00:04:13,389 --> 00:04:17,139
we're talking about you know when it's

107
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:20,829
it's it's a strange thing because the

108
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:23,650
dark resin the dark bubble for sure can

109
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:25,598
be absolute fire I find particularly in

110
00:04:23,649 --> 00:04:26,209
tropical countries the bubble will often

111
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:28,310
go dark

112
00:04:26,209 --> 00:04:30,589
just from the oxidization and the heat I

113
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:33,500
saw it in Spain the last time I was

114
00:04:30,589 --> 00:04:36,529
there really really beautiful dark

115
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:41,120
Amber's almost reds all you know deeply

116
00:04:36,529 --> 00:04:42,948
twisted oranges just beautiful hash read

117
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,879
on Kaylee don't be late don't be sorry

118
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,800
don't be sorry

119
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:47,899
right on Kaylee's mom I hope you guys

120
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:50,870
are all having a good good day puffs and

121
00:04:47,899 --> 00:04:55,698
bowls over there yeah for sure me too

122
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:57,319
Cuban me too I do remember when the West

123
00:04:55,699 --> 00:04:59,030
Coast boys Rose in that 10-year old

124
00:04:57,319 --> 00:05:00,590
bubble I brought that 10 year old bubble

125
00:04:59,029 --> 00:05:01,909
to them so they could rosin it that was

126
00:05:00,589 --> 00:05:04,579
a very nice thing for them to have done

127
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:06,080
for Steve because those guys are

128
00:05:04,579 --> 00:05:09,620
connoisseurs and let me tell you they

129
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:12,529
were not too stoked on the quality of

130
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:13,819
that end product you know I'm not too

131
00:05:12,529 --> 00:05:15,439
sure David it might be the oh nine

132
00:05:13,819 --> 00:05:17,120
cookies I can't remember the last sift I

133
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:18,680
clean this is so old at this point in

134
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,490
time I wasn't puffing it for the longest

135
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:24,740
time but it is full melt it drips and

136
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:29,930
bubbles into a liquid and is definitely

137
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:33,889
on point for that sweet from a Dean ale

138
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:37,189
to heat up a little bit and we'll have a

139
00:05:33,889 --> 00:05:38,750
rip with you guys that's a good price 35

140
00:05:37,189 --> 00:05:42,139
euros you know I'd love to even see it

141
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:44,629
cheaper but it's tough paying these

142
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:46,189
insane prices when you can do that swai

143
00:05:44,629 --> 00:05:49,490
a lot of people are happy to grow their

144
00:05:46,189 --> 00:05:51,589
own you know what sticks with Terps I

145
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:53,210
have no idea I talked to the cookie fan

146
00:05:51,589 --> 00:05:54,978
guys and they were just like Oh nein

147
00:05:53,209 --> 00:05:57,379
cookies what the [ __ ] that doesn't even

148
00:05:54,978 --> 00:05:59,269
make any sense so I suspect it's one of

149
00:05:57,379 --> 00:06:02,959
these situations where a name got named

150
00:05:59,269 --> 00:06:04,728
something and I kind of feel bad every

151
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:08,138
time I say the name because I know [ __ ]

152
00:06:04,728 --> 00:06:11,598
in flux or cringing in their in their

153
00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:13,788
surroundings of true cookies but it is

154
00:06:11,598 --> 00:06:15,800
what it is how much is decent hash in

155
00:06:13,788 --> 00:06:17,300
Jamaica decent hash is very hard to find

156
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,550
in Jamaica but you could probably pay

157
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:21,650
about 20 plus dollars for a gram I've

158
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:24,168
heard that some of the co2 oil and such

159
00:06:21,649 --> 00:06:28,609
is going for 50 and 60 dollars a gram on

160
00:06:24,168 --> 00:06:33,228
in the nicer in the nicer hotels should

161
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:34,968
we get this going on now yeah I think

162
00:06:33,228 --> 00:06:36,740
it's fire but I'm just not sure if it's

163
00:06:34,968 --> 00:06:38,449
actually cookies so this is the thing

164
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:39,230
right we really need to get people like

165
00:06:38,449 --> 00:06:41,870
to name things

166
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:44,350
things and it's like you're right let's

167
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:44,350
just rip it

168
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:15,090
that was nice

169
00:07:29,779 --> 00:07:36,409
well that was really nice you know what

170
00:07:33,089 --> 00:07:38,879
I love about properly cured rice EFT

171
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:41,430
it's so smooth

172
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:44,159
this isn't dry sip that was taken fresh

173
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:46,530
and put in a vac freezer and had

174
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,960
moisture this is properly dried and

175
00:07:46,529 --> 00:07:51,149
cured and processed dry cept

176
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:52,829
and because of it it's just absolutely

177
00:07:51,149 --> 00:07:55,139
smooth I'm gonna take one twice as big

178
00:07:52,829 --> 00:08:07,169
as that because that one tasted just

179
00:07:55,139 --> 00:08:08,639
like another yes you can can a guide but

180
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:10,920
it depends on what your definition of

181
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,319
trim if you want to produce full mount

182
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:15,509
from trim it better be proper trim I'm

183
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:17,490
talking about the tiny little pieces of

184
00:08:15,509 --> 00:08:19,800
from the bud that you cut clip away not

185
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:21,480
the large fan leaves maybe small fan

186
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:24,329
leaves like that if they have resin all

187
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:26,990
over them but all the first bubble I

188
00:08:24,329 --> 00:08:30,240
made back in the day was absolute

189
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:32,730
absolutely made from trim and once I got

190
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,500
the growers trained to producing the

191
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:37,590
trim that I required which was really

192
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:39,299
generally simply put when the resin when

193
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:41,759
the leaf has no resin put it on this

194
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:43,769
pile when it has sugar exactly sugar

195
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:46,439
leaves over to the right and you know

196
00:08:43,769 --> 00:08:48,179
everything else over to the left and I

197
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,480
don't know whoredom at four or five I've

198
00:08:48,179 --> 00:08:54,239
sold a couple here and there maybe four

199
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:58,950
so you can absolutely get incredible

200
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:01,500
quality from trim it's it's you know

201
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:02,759
there are some trims that still will

202
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,250
have this minorly

203
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:06,960
like I'll sometimes I'll be like oh did

204
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:09,899
you make this from trim like I'll taste

205
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:11,759
that hey that really really a lot of

206
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:13,649
people won't taste it but I'll sometimes

207
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:16,200
taste it and I think it has a lot to do

208
00:09:13,649 --> 00:09:18,569
with the terpene profile of the plant

209
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:22,140
Renae for instance the trim made bubble

210
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:24,540
that was as nice as tasty as quality as

211
00:09:22,139 --> 00:09:26,830
the bud and so that was a very confusing

212
00:09:24,539 --> 00:09:29,079
thing now other cultivars did not do

213
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:31,600
yes the grass tastes I can really taste

214
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:34,060
the grass taste in dry sipped made from

215
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:38,019
trim if you use trim and make dry sift

216
00:09:34,059 --> 00:09:39,669
unless you clean it to 99.999 I'm gonna

217
00:09:38,019 --> 00:09:42,820
taste that hay in there just a little

218
00:09:39,669 --> 00:09:45,399
bit let's have another big rip shall we

219
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:48,970
it actually had really nice effects like

220
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:50,250
it got me really really stoned not gonna

221
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:54,970
lie

222
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:57,389
let's have another shall we trying to

223
00:09:54,970 --> 00:10:01,269
get a big one it's not that easy oh

224
00:09:57,389 --> 00:10:02,860
that's a pretty big one if it will let

225
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:05,139
me oh there we go

226
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:08,320
I wouldn't say it's twice the size but

227
00:10:05,139 --> 00:10:10,870
it's big it's big it'll be good

228
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,910
yella well hey that's a good idea thank

229
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:14,970
you for smoking pot that's a very good

230
00:10:12,909 --> 00:10:14,969
idea

231
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,620
you that one was really nice on top of

232
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:56,389
my second when it really finally grabbed

233
00:10:45,620 --> 00:11:05,629
me I was like I'm going in again this

234
00:10:56,389 --> 00:11:09,230
was made from bud well as it should

235
00:11:05,629 --> 00:11:12,500
I'm hitting beautiful dry cept this

236
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:13,909
often sends people reeling a lot of

237
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,730
people aren't really used to the puffs

238
00:11:13,909 --> 00:11:19,309
that a full mount dry sip will give you

239
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:20,839
it's not going to be the same as pretty

240
00:11:19,309 --> 00:11:22,669
much any other concentrate

241
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:25,190
unless you're smoking really unique

242
00:11:22,669 --> 00:11:28,189
cultivars that produce you know the

243
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:30,790
alcohol soluble terpenes that don't wash

244
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:33,319
away in the water I've seen some really

245
00:11:30,789 --> 00:11:35,480
what's the key to dry sifting buds well

246
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:36,889
I don't think there is any one key I

247
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:39,350
think that's why it's a difficult and

248
00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:43,190
complex thing and most people are unable

249
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:44,420
to do it carding allowed a very few

250
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:46,790
people to get on board

251
00:11:44,419 --> 00:11:51,078
one sneeze discovered that he could wrap

252
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:54,349
his card with parchment that created the

253
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:56,359
static addition Darrin added the deep

254
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:58,430
that the the DVD and then other people

255
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:01,068
went with books and wider things to

256
00:11:58,429 --> 00:12:05,289
create a wider edge along the bottom and

257
00:12:01,068 --> 00:12:10,299
now you have you know people producing

258
00:12:05,289 --> 00:12:12,409
99% dry sift that was otherwise you know

259
00:12:10,299 --> 00:12:14,620
they weren't they weren't pulling it off

260
00:12:12,409 --> 00:12:17,419
quite with carding I was able to get to

261
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:19,970
99.999% with carding only because I was

262
00:12:17,419 --> 00:12:22,399
so obsessed and I would card for hours

263
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:24,860
sometimes first time we carted just a

264
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:27,708
couple of rips Johnny B and I the first

265
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:29,509
time he I did it with him to show him I

266
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:32,568
had been doing it for a while at that

267
00:12:29,509 --> 00:12:35,740
point in time maybe 10 years it took 40

268
00:12:32,568 --> 00:12:41,120
minutes just to produce one really

269
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:43,220
yeah one you know beautiful rip each and

270
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,289
that's also on YouTube but it's the 2012

271
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:47,509
video of rip and dry sips with Johnny B

272
00:12:45,289 --> 00:12:49,338
and I love the video because at the end

273
00:12:47,509 --> 00:12:50,689
of the video actually I'm gonna show you

274
00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:55,700
the video because it's so [ __ ]

275
00:12:50,690 --> 00:13:01,160
awesome dry sip dry that's weird

276
00:12:55,700 --> 00:13:03,589
I'm not sure dry sipped ribs YouTube I

277
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:07,519
don't know the exact name of it so Oh

278
00:13:03,589 --> 00:13:10,250
full mouth dry sift no oh here it is dry

279
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,838
sift after 40 minutes of cleaning all

280
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:18,589
right let's get you guys a little show

281
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:22,820
here so this is me and Johnny be smoking

282
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:30,589
his hash that I cleaned up got it all

283
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:34,400
melty oh yeah little B line rippin

284
00:13:30,589 --> 00:13:36,880
little B Line rippin not too shabby

285
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:39,319
the best part is the laughs at the end

286
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:41,299
so yeah we're just showing the purity

287
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:43,820
here you know this is really high

288
00:13:41,299 --> 00:13:46,990
quality now when Johnny B came over with

289
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:49,490
this stuff it was like 20% heads I

290
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:51,259
remember him being excited about it we

291
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:52,850
had just met and I said listen this is

292
00:13:51,259 --> 00:13:55,819
farmers grade and he kind of was a

293
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:57,680
little insulted and that I just we just

294
00:13:55,820 --> 00:14:01,550
cleaned it and Johnny B never looked

295
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:05,389
back from that day forward he was a full

296
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:07,240
melt hasher yeah and this is dry set

297
00:14:05,389 --> 00:14:10,370
that I cleaned right here in my office

298
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:11,930
right here in my office I cleaned it so

299
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:13,549
it's starting to char up finally and

300
00:14:11,929 --> 00:14:16,699
we're just trying to finish it this was

301
00:14:13,549 --> 00:14:20,289
this rip took like 20 rips listen to the

302
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:22,940
laughs when I exhale this is so awesome

303
00:14:20,289 --> 00:14:25,088
it's coming I'm about to exhale and blow

304
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:25,089
up

305
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:33,990
[Laughter]

306
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:36,389
the Charlie the wax membranes the

307
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:38,430
fibrous mat the the you know the

308
00:14:36,389 --> 00:14:43,110
material that's left over from the gland

309
00:14:38,429 --> 00:14:47,039
that isn't oil so pretty fun good laugh

310
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:48,300
yeah giggling like a schoolgirl well you

311
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:49,559
know that's funny that you should ask is

312
00:14:48,299 --> 00:14:52,049
there any way to make a distillate

313
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:53,250
without a solvent because that's

314
00:14:52,049 --> 00:14:56,039
something that we're working on right

315
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:59,339
now trying to create a distillate from

316
00:14:56,039 --> 00:15:00,778
rosin without using a solvent so let us

317
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:03,870
get back to you on that one

318
00:15:00,778 --> 00:15:05,850
yeah indra who made me laugh to you see

319
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:07,799
that rip we had set it up and what you

320
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:10,589
don't see off-camera is that no one

321
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:13,189
person smoked that whole bowl John and I

322
00:15:10,589 --> 00:15:16,140
were both going like crazy we'd hit it

323
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:18,930
he'd hit it I'd hit it he'd hit it I did

324
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:21,000
it he hit it it got so ridiculous that

325
00:15:18,929 --> 00:15:23,309
at the end we were almost unable to

326
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,950
finish the bowl and I was I kept trying

327
00:15:23,309 --> 00:15:28,528
to and right at the end when I finish it

328
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:33,839
I just I give it all blows out and I I

329
00:15:28,528 --> 00:15:35,939
just had to bust into laughter it was it

330
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:38,910
was quite a rip even for the two of us

331
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:43,020
it was a rip and I will say that we both

332
00:15:38,909 --> 00:15:45,299
felt quite wonderful it also obviously

333
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:47,278
made us feel really good for John it was

334
00:15:45,299 --> 00:15:48,958
a profound revelation cuz he was in a

335
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:51,240
lot of pain at that point in time and he

336
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:54,929
was using cannabis for his pain but he

337
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:56,820
had never acquired that clean or pure of

338
00:15:54,929 --> 00:15:59,549
a product and it was his own resin and

339
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:01,829
the thing about John is he grows great

340
00:15:59,549 --> 00:16:05,250
resin he just didn't know how to process

341
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:07,169
it when I met him and so when I took his

342
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:09,299
resin and cleaned it and saw that it

343
00:16:07,169 --> 00:16:12,500
melted like that I was like alright okay

344
00:16:09,299 --> 00:16:15,179
you know this next thing you know I

345
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:16,649
basically said to him you know what

346
00:16:15,179 --> 00:16:18,958
about bubble why don't you try bubbles

347
00:16:16,649 --> 00:16:21,450
oh god I've never really been impressed

348
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:24,599
with bubble and so you know what I did

349
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:27,060
was basically go over to his place and

350
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:31,159
whip up a batch of his material make a

351
00:16:27,059 --> 00:16:33,539
make a batch for him and it was

352
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:34,969
unbelievable quality once again whoo

353
00:16:33,539 --> 00:16:38,719
what are we going on here

354
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:40,970
why why is this guy like there we go

355
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,579
I don't even know what that dudes deal

356
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:45,379
is but he's gotta go yeah bubble

357
00:16:43,578 --> 00:16:46,578
ambassadors so going there and making

358
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:47,959
bubble at his house he was kind of like

359
00:16:46,578 --> 00:16:49,399
I've made bubble I'm not really that

360
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:50,750
impressed that I'm like well maybe you

361
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:52,578
were doing it the way you were dry

362
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:55,490
sifting so he was like oh yeah maybe I

363
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:58,578
was I don't know so we ran eight bags we

364
00:16:55,490 --> 00:17:01,459
produced some absolutely stellar product

365
00:16:58,578 --> 00:17:04,220
and once again you know that those are

366
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:06,259
the things that he identifies himself by

367
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:10,279
now his dry sifting in his bubble

368
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:11,869
hashing so hats off to Johnny B for you

369
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:15,709
know growing the good resin and making

370
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:17,899
the good making the good isolates yeah

371
00:17:15,709 --> 00:17:21,620
grape God is really nice I've had the

372
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:22,909
hash I've had the rosin very nice I love

373
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:25,068
using your saying whenever someone has

374
00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:26,480
poop soup I hope I say bah no yeah

375
00:17:25,068 --> 00:17:28,279
whoredom at well that's a good good way

376
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:31,759
to go about it if it's poop soup you

377
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:33,529
know difference between solvent free and

378
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:35,480
solvent list there is no difference Nick

379
00:17:33,529 --> 00:17:37,819
Lutz because there's no such thing even

380
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:39,919
though I myself have fallen victim to it

381
00:17:37,819 --> 00:17:41,509
there's no such thing as solvent list

382
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,490
when it comes to cannabis because all

383
00:17:41,509 --> 00:17:47,089
the hydrocarbons that are the terpenes

384
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:48,980
are solvents so how do you call it

385
00:17:47,089 --> 00:17:52,189
solvent list it's more like if you want

386
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:55,730
to say it's it's you know it's not made

387
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:57,820
using petrochemical based solvents you

388
00:17:55,730 --> 00:18:00,048
could say something like that

389
00:17:57,819 --> 00:18:02,450
petrochemical based solvents or whatnot

390
00:18:00,048 --> 00:18:05,089
but it's definitely they are still

391
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:07,460
solvents the the terpenes are solvents

392
00:18:05,089 --> 00:18:10,369
they are hydrocarbons that's why Horatio

393
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:12,220
could take the terpene dilemma Neen and

394
00:18:10,369 --> 00:18:14,658
make oil with it instead of you know

395
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:17,089
running butane through the tube

396
00:18:14,659 --> 00:18:22,909
he runs delimiting through the tube and

397
00:18:17,089 --> 00:18:26,240
he gets his extract well it means that

398
00:18:22,909 --> 00:18:27,919
the the solvent they used has all been

399
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,589
cleaned out that's what they that's what

400
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:33,020
they mean but for me the solvent is

401
00:18:30,589 --> 00:18:34,819
never really the big worry it's whatever

402
00:18:33,019 --> 00:18:37,460
heavy metal contaminant can be

403
00:18:34,819 --> 00:18:40,279
potentially laying in the solvent that

404
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:42,470
is you know or pesticide worse say the

405
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:44,119
solvent is clean as clean can be but you

406
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:45,298
end up getting material that is late

407
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:47,099
ladened with

408
00:18:45,298 --> 00:18:48,839
besides those pesticides will have very

409
00:18:47,099 --> 00:18:50,819
similar molecular weights as the

410
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:53,009
cannabinoids and even if you run it

411
00:18:50,819 --> 00:18:54,868
through a short path molecular

412
00:18:53,009 --> 00:18:57,929
distillation unit you're still going to

413
00:18:54,868 --> 00:19:00,689
have concentrated with that oil all

414
00:18:57,929 --> 00:19:02,460
those pesticides so yeah petrochemical

415
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:03,889
free extracts you know that that's

416
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:10,980
that's probably a little bit more

417
00:19:03,888 --> 00:19:13,349
accurate bubble hash turns dark

418
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:15,509
depending on the oils inside sometimes

419
00:19:13,349 --> 00:19:19,319
it stays very bright I've had stuff

420
00:19:15,509 --> 00:19:22,139
bubble hash be very blonde be very red

421
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:23,730
generally it's oxidization you know if I

422
00:19:22,138 --> 00:19:27,028
keep it I've got some here that looks

423
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:29,460
almost black it really depends on how I

424
00:19:27,028 --> 00:19:31,200
let it get exposed but if I make a very

425
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:34,259
and then also the life cycle of the

426
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:36,690
trichome like people now love the light

427
00:19:34,259 --> 00:19:38,429
golden color so will end up and also

428
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:40,320
people love cutting their herb down

429
00:19:38,429 --> 00:19:43,320
early so they can get it sold and they

430
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:44,908
can get paid faster a combination of

431
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:47,339
those two things really does create a

432
00:19:44,909 --> 00:19:49,019
very light colored resin if you take

433
00:19:47,339 --> 00:19:51,538
that light colored resin and keep it in

434
00:19:49,019 --> 00:19:56,999
a fridge or a freezer it's pretty much

435
00:19:51,538 --> 00:20:02,158
going to stay preserved it's not going

436
00:19:56,999 --> 00:20:03,749
to get very dark to a degree Conor but

437
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,489
it depends on how cold you keep the

438
00:20:03,749 --> 00:20:08,368
water and how fast you can wash it

439
00:20:05,489 --> 00:20:11,038
because a lot like for me I wash fast

440
00:20:08,368 --> 00:20:13,470
I'm not about mixing and then taking my

441
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:14,940
sweet time pulling the bags in a perfect

442
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:16,288
world you'd have four or five friends

443
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:18,239
and you'd all pull those bags all

444
00:20:16,288 --> 00:20:20,308
simultaneously get the water out right

445
00:20:18,239 --> 00:20:26,149
away you know you don't want it to be

446
00:20:20,308 --> 00:20:26,148
there any longer than it needs to be so

447
00:20:26,419 --> 00:20:32,309
no I mean like I said you know I love

448
00:20:29,069 --> 00:20:35,189
properly cured resin and often properly

449
00:20:32,308 --> 00:20:36,538
cured resin is not light in color when I

450
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:38,548
you know some of the best present I've

451
00:20:36,538 --> 00:20:42,778
ever smoked in my life was fairly dark

452
00:20:38,548 --> 00:20:45,118
in color reddish dark but much darker

453
00:20:42,778 --> 00:20:46,558
than blond or you know this sort of

454
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:49,709
beige color that I've got

455
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:51,480
here oh it smells good though when I

456
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:54,509
leave the lids off of these dry sift

457
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:57,179
it's like Terk heaven it fills up the

458
00:20:54,509 --> 00:21:02,548
entire room with this beautiful terpene

459
00:20:57,179 --> 00:21:04,048
latent smell very good so yeah how do I

460
00:21:02,548 --> 00:21:07,619
feel about storing flour in a fridge or

461
00:21:04,048 --> 00:21:09,538
freezer well it'll it'll it'll it'll

462
00:21:07,619 --> 00:21:11,548
suck out moisture unless you can really

463
00:21:09,538 --> 00:21:12,960
seal it properly it'll just it'll remove

464
00:21:11,548 --> 00:21:15,720
the moisture that's what it'll do the

465
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,669
moisture will try to leave the bud go on

466
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,470
the inside of the bag and then the

467
00:21:17,669 --> 00:21:21,899
process of the moisture leaving the bud

468
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:24,690
and then getting reabsorbed to me

469
00:21:21,898 --> 00:21:26,939
turns bud into hay and so I'm not an

470
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:28,679
overly big fan of it especially in that

471
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:32,038
process I'm sure terpenes are being

472
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:38,009
affected even though it's cold there's

473
00:21:32,038 --> 00:21:39,388
still an evaporation happening put in a

474
00:21:38,009 --> 00:21:42,899
chest freezer for long-term storage

475
00:21:39,388 --> 00:21:44,609
alright well there it is if you want a

476
00:21:42,898 --> 00:21:46,138
vacuum that's definitely the better idea

477
00:21:44,609 --> 00:21:51,449
you don't want any room between that

478
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:52,979
herb and that who knows what the ideal

479
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:54,720
curing temp is that's something you're

480
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,139
gonna want to find out from you know for

481
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,690
you

482
00:21:55,138 --> 00:21:59,998
I like colder I like to preserve you

483
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:03,659
know you know terpenes but I also like

484
00:21:59,999 --> 00:22:05,639
to evaporate out the most caustic ones

485
00:22:03,659 --> 00:22:08,009
that are a little bit harsher on the

486
00:22:05,638 --> 00:22:10,258
throat when you don't when you cut it

487
00:22:08,009 --> 00:22:13,259
fresh frozen and you wash it right away

488
00:22:10,259 --> 00:22:16,528
and you keep the fresh cold the whole

489
00:22:13,259 --> 00:22:19,079
time you get a very more of a harsh sort

490
00:22:16,528 --> 00:22:21,960
of grab you by the nuts rip a lot of

491
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:24,319
people like that I myself prefer a

492
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:26,490
little bit more of a smooth rip

493
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:27,470
especially if I'm going to take 40 or 50

494
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:30,028
of them in a day

495
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:32,009
nitrogen storage would be for a long

496
00:22:30,028 --> 00:22:33,628
term if you wanted to remove the oxygen

497
00:22:32,009 --> 00:22:35,339
and replace it with nitrogen for sure

498
00:22:33,628 --> 00:22:41,908
that's going to preserve much longer

499
00:22:35,339 --> 00:22:44,490
than oxygen would yeah alright grab me

500
00:22:41,909 --> 00:22:46,320
by the short and curlies well head here

501
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:48,089
if I used to do fresh froze and I was

502
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:50,700
all about it but what I found was it was

503
00:22:48,089 --> 00:22:52,408
like a cheat it was like a way that

504
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:54,160
could this is the importance of bubble

505
00:22:52,409 --> 00:22:55,900
bags I wish I could learn how to say

506
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:59,470
this is gonna be really good drop if I

507
00:22:55,900 --> 00:23:03,250
can figure this out bubble bags are a

508
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:06,610
guide they guide you in growing and so

509
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:09,660
if you listen to them they will take you

510
00:23:06,609 --> 00:23:12,639
to a place where you can give that plant

511
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:16,360
what it means to express itself to the

512
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:21,030
maximum of its potential okay now what I

513
00:23:16,359 --> 00:23:23,559
mean by that is how to really explain it

514
00:23:21,029 --> 00:23:25,899
how to really explain it it's it this is

515
00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:27,789
this is so I I don't want to get lost in

516
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:32,019
my thoughts but this is this is a this

517
00:23:27,789 --> 00:23:33,509
is an important factor properly drawing

518
00:23:32,019 --> 00:23:36,430
the resin okay

519
00:23:33,509 --> 00:23:38,500
would we ever smoke fresh herb no it's

520
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:40,060
harsh it hurts our throats because those

521
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:42,130
caustic terpenes the ones that are

522
00:23:40,059 --> 00:23:44,409
evaporating out at room temperature I'm

523
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:46,150
not sure we're supposed to be inhaling

524
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:48,130
those ones and those are the ones that

525
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:50,430
people are trying to save to get a

526
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:53,200
higher terpene production that's fine I

527
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:55,420
used to make bubble with trim that was

528
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:58,000
bone dry and that bubble came out six

529
00:23:55,420 --> 00:24:00,279
star it was called Renee so I know that

530
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,640
it can be done I know that the nicest

531
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:06,250
bubble can be made from from dried cured

532
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:10,720
bud and to this day I still prefer it

533
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:13,240
and I see that you know if your bud is

534
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,880
grown to the maximum of its potential

535
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:18,220
and you you and you dry and cure it and

536
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:20,080
you take that dry and cured material and

537
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:22,870
you make bubble hash with it it will

538
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:25,179
melt into a liquid now the problem is

539
00:24:22,869 --> 00:24:27,339
most people's material most people that

540
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:29,200
make fresh frozen if you dry their

541
00:24:27,339 --> 00:24:30,669
material and you make bubble with it it

542
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,680
doesn't melt anymore

543
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:35,140
so the melting factor has more to do

544
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:37,330
with the wax membrane and the moisture

545
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:39,910
content of that membrane boiling out

546
00:24:37,329 --> 00:24:42,909
when you hit the hash then an actual

547
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:44,320
melt factor so it's kind of a cheat it's

548
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:45,759
kind of a little bit like oh I didn't

549
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:48,460
listen to the bags I'm just cutting it

550
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:50,619
fresh frozen now I'm just yeah Yahweh

551
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:52,360
trust me dude people are how do you use

552
00:24:50,619 --> 00:24:54,699
dry material and still get it to melt

553
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:57,039
it's like it's called growing great pot

554
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:58,840
look into it it's what the bags have

555
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:01,389
been trying to tell you but you're

556
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:03,909
ignoring them and unfortunately when I

557
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:04,740
started releasing the bags the BHO

558
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:07,170
method came out

559
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:09,089
immediately like a month later and a lot

560
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:11,070
of people would try the bags and then be

561
00:25:09,089 --> 00:25:13,109
like oh that shit's not that good which

562
00:25:11,069 --> 00:25:15,269
really was telling them your shit's not

563
00:25:13,109 --> 00:25:17,669
that good and they would just instead of

564
00:25:15,269 --> 00:25:20,250
growing better herb they would go make

565
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:22,410
oil and the same things happening with

566
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:23,849
rosin people are making a meltable

567
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:25,740
product out of something that's not

568
00:25:23,849 --> 00:25:27,839
mountable well of course it mounts it's

569
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:30,299
oil you melted the glans off the head

570
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:34,199
it's not going to be as impressive as

571
00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:35,639
hash melting hash melting is impressive

572
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,990
that means you grew that plant to

573
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:40,080
absolute perfection and then you

574
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:42,660
purified those glands to perfection if

575
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:43,710
you can do both those things trust me

576
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:46,590
that is the Holy Grail

577
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:49,289
nobody loves anything more than that and

578
00:25:46,589 --> 00:25:51,539
just very few people have it it's a it's

579
00:25:49,289 --> 00:25:53,970
a rarity to have full melt dry sift I

580
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:56,579
have some for instance but the problem

581
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:58,410
is both of these were not grown to

582
00:25:56,579 --> 00:26:00,119
perfection this was not grown to

583
00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:02,400
perfection I would say it's a seven out

584
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:04,409
of ten and this one has not grown to

585
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:07,320
perfection it might be a seven point

586
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:09,179
five out of ten now keep in mind for the

587
00:26:07,319 --> 00:26:11,099
most part because so many people now are

588
00:26:09,179 --> 00:26:14,759
used to just blasting they're so used to

589
00:26:11,099 --> 00:26:17,490
not seeing quality but a7 is the new 10

590
00:26:14,759 --> 00:26:19,200
which is really [ __ ] unfortunate when

591
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:21,329
we're in an era where we know the

592
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,308
importance of this medicine and we would

593
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:25,549
think that the highest quality would be

594
00:26:23,308 --> 00:26:28,829
the most important for us whether we are

595
00:26:25,549 --> 00:26:32,609
sick or whether we are healthy and

596
00:26:28,829 --> 00:26:34,500
trying to prevent so that's what I

597
00:26:32,609 --> 00:26:36,750
wanted to say about that the bubble bags

598
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:38,519
are about if you run your material

599
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:40,589
through bubble bags and it does not come

600
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:42,779
out melty and beautiful and tasty and

601
00:26:40,589 --> 00:26:45,240
wonderful then you're not doing

602
00:26:42,779 --> 00:26:47,849
something right and the bags have told

603
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:51,150
you so please listen to them listen to

604
00:26:47,849 --> 00:26:53,399
them and go back and learn from it learn

605
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:55,980
about maybe creating a living soil maybe

606
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:58,110
look into those strains of bacteria for

607
00:26:55,980 --> 00:27:00,150
the roots that can produce healthier

608
00:26:58,109 --> 00:27:00,889
happier plants all of these different

609
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:03,690
things

610
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:05,480
Allen Malta the best thing you can do if

611
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:08,220
you can get material from someone else

612
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:09,779
run their material for them and give it

613
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:12,179
to them in this and show them look at

614
00:27:09,779 --> 00:27:16,200
this do you know what this is it's a

615
00:27:12,179 --> 00:27:17,350
c-plus at best you just passed maybe

616
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:20,769
it's even a d'

617
00:27:17,349 --> 00:27:24,219
some might be adi some are c plus some

618
00:27:20,769 --> 00:27:28,388
are B's some are B pluses but very very

619
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:31,899
very few are a pluses because the a

620
00:27:28,388 --> 00:27:35,439
pluses they just find they get gobbled

621
00:27:31,898 --> 00:27:37,178
up so fast let me tell you that much how

622
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,610
crucial is the drying process if you're

623
00:27:37,179 --> 00:27:41,769
using grain a flours well fairly

624
00:27:39,609 --> 00:27:43,508
important you could [ __ ] it up to a

625
00:27:41,769 --> 00:27:46,659
degree although the highest quality

626
00:27:43,509 --> 00:27:48,788
flowers I can tell you the product

627
00:27:46,659 --> 00:27:50,139
always melts you know but hearing is

628
00:27:48,788 --> 00:27:52,148
going to be important you've grown this

629
00:27:50,138 --> 00:27:53,769
thing to perfection you purified it to

630
00:27:52,148 --> 00:27:56,979
perfection you're done everything right

631
00:27:53,769 --> 00:27:58,419
why [ __ ] it up at the end one way to

632
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:00,069
[ __ ] it up at the end and a lot of

633
00:27:58,419 --> 00:28:02,470
people would do is they would put it all

634
00:28:00,069 --> 00:28:04,569
together I would say use it put it on a

635
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:06,129
desiccant and sieve it so it breaks into

636
00:28:04,569 --> 00:28:08,439
powder they would still powder it all

637
00:28:06,128 --> 00:28:10,148
into a pile like this I don't want to

638
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:13,120
see it piled into a pile I want to see

639
00:28:10,148 --> 00:28:14,739
little specks spread very thin over the

640
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:16,778
desiccant over the cardboard because

641
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:18,669
that is what's going to pull the

642
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:20,528
moisture out properly another thing I

643
00:28:18,669 --> 00:28:22,450
see is when people start to feel the

644
00:28:20,528 --> 00:28:24,220
hash and they say oh it's kind of I

645
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:26,679
think it's dry now it's it's it's really

646
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:28,929
dry my trust me it isn't it's it's it's

647
00:28:26,679 --> 00:28:30,940
a it's a trick the outside is dry but

648
00:28:28,929 --> 00:28:32,710
the inside is not and they'll go and

649
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:35,350
they'll rub it all together and make a

650
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:37,389
ball and of course you know you're gonna

651
00:28:35,349 --> 00:28:39,490
end up with this buttered out kind of

652
00:28:37,388 --> 00:28:41,918
you know falling apart hash that ends up

653
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:44,519
smelling of that sort of funky moisture

654
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:46,809
this is what we saw in the early days

655
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:48,548
mostly my fault

656
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:50,980
I showed a lot of people incorrectly how

657
00:28:48,548 --> 00:28:52,839
to make how to how to you know put

658
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:55,569
bubble together afterwards and I spent

659
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:59,349
years trying to explain the importance

660
00:28:55,569 --> 00:29:01,298
of removing all of the moisture content

661
00:28:59,349 --> 00:29:03,579
so keep in mind when I started showing

662
00:29:01,298 --> 00:29:08,440
this to people no one was really making

663
00:29:03,579 --> 00:29:10,960
medical isolates for patients it was a

664
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:13,629
very new thing and I think most people

665
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:16,629
were producing it for personal use it

666
00:29:13,628 --> 00:29:18,308
was a personal use thing and now we've

667
00:29:16,628 --> 00:29:19,750
gotten to a point where it's turning

668
00:29:18,308 --> 00:29:21,879
commercial and

669
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:24,190
now we've got to change up the tools a

670
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:26,080
little bit so you know I dried out for

671
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:27,910
10 to 15 but I'm in the Pacific

672
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:30,939
Northwest so you know generally you

673
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:34,210
could probably hit that same range in

674
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:40,090
about 3 to 4 days you know in a in a dry

675
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:42,039
place like Arizona or something well you

676
00:29:40,089 --> 00:29:44,619
know what drew I'm not fussy I don't

677
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:46,539
grow all my cannabis and I I don't

678
00:29:44,619 --> 00:29:48,789
pretend to think that one way is better

679
00:29:46,539 --> 00:29:50,649
than the other as I get older I realize

680
00:29:48,789 --> 00:29:52,960
that a quiver is an important thing

681
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:54,730
because it gives us options and I know

682
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:57,850
that I feel different on different days

683
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:59,860
and I have different months and weeks of

684
00:29:57,849 --> 00:30:03,189
my life so why would I want to have only

685
00:29:59,859 --> 00:30:05,139
one thing to take me to take care of me

686
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:06,789
when it comes to cannabis there are so

687
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:09,160
many beautiful options and that's why I

688
00:30:06,789 --> 00:30:11,319
always say I don't fight against

689
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:15,630
anything that already exists I just

690
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:18,849
fight for more that's the way to do it

691
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:20,710
yeah possible for a hash mate with like

692
00:30:18,849 --> 00:30:22,809
4 to 5% terpene content to make a house

693
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:24,579
that doesn't butter out I'd be hard to

694
00:30:22,809 --> 00:30:27,940
say dan Richards I couldn't really say

695
00:30:24,579 --> 00:30:29,710
it's possible the terpene content might

696
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:31,720
very well just be too high and when you

697
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:33,880
concentrate that much hash it very well

698
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:35,500
may butter itself out

699
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:37,390
we know that terpenes can butter out

700
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:39,519
hash we know that moisture content can

701
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:41,680
butter out hash at the same time I've

702
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:44,319
had very chirpy hash that I've managed

703
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:48,370
to dry properly and I'm keeping in mind

704
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:50,259
drying properly is I think it could take

705
00:30:48,369 --> 00:30:52,750
a couple of months sometimes to hang a

706
00:30:50,259 --> 00:30:54,640
plant and get it prepared for dry

707
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:56,859
sifting so those those little heads

708
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,630
shrink like little resins and you just

709
00:30:56,859 --> 00:31:00,309
know that all that's really in there is

710
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:01,840
that resin head sure you're gonna lose

711
00:31:00,309 --> 00:31:05,740
some of your terpenes and your weight

712
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:08,079
but the smoothness of that smoke and the

713
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:09,670
watching it melted I'll tell you any one

714
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:11,769
I ever put that in their bowl the

715
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:14,259
impressive they can't believe they can

716
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:16,539
get that high without coughing and

717
00:31:14,259 --> 00:31:18,849
turning red you know and don't get me

718
00:31:16,539 --> 00:31:20,470
wrong you can turn a coffin turn red

719
00:31:18,849 --> 00:31:22,990
you're gonna get maybe one or two rips

720
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:24,400
of that smooth and by the time you take

721
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:27,789
your second or third you're gonna be

722
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:29,009
like oh because it's just unbelievably

723
00:31:27,789 --> 00:31:30,750
pure

724
00:31:29,009 --> 00:31:35,700
if it's properly grown then that's even

725
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:37,980
better that's for sure well excellent

726
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:39,840
Akio Tom I'm glad you are I always want

727
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:41,640
it to be a good one we're gonna have

728
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:43,649
another one tomorrow another one Friday

729
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:46,130
and hopefully another one on Saturday

730
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:47,670
morning so we will see you guys all

731
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:50,570
sooner than later

732
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:53,700
and as I always like to finish it as a

733
00:31:50,569 --> 00:31:56,159
already said the end of it but may the

734
00:31:53,700 --> 00:32:00,170
full melt bless your bowl sooner than

735
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:00,170
later peace out everybody
