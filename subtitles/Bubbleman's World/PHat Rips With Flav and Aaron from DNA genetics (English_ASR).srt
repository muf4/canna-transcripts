easier to torch the bowl yeah no at at

35
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:52,718
an angle excellent and that's a super

36
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,000

astounding oh yes you just don't realize

118
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:54,560
it's such a it's such a huge can yes

119
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:56,959
with an

120
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,800
absolute ridiculous amount of water I

121
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:01,599
don't know if you guys can see how much

122
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,079
like like compared to a hand oh I know

123
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,479
the water's all the way up and the can

124
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:06,879
is very unique how far does the down

125
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:08,839
stem go though the down stem is massive

126
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:11,800
let's pull it it's a very big

127
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:13,638
downstep no I can see you don't need oh

128
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:16,360
you can do

129
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:18,560
it no no no don't pull

130
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:20,840
it don't pull it

131
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,160
up no because I can see it from this

132
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:26,038
angle yeah so that's I mean it just goes

133
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:27,319
below that first line yeah so you need

134
00:06:26,038 --> 00:06:29,519
actually quite a lot of water in here

135
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:32,120
just side Ang careful this really does

136
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:33,879
does like move on this yeah it does like

137
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:36,478
unbelievable when I tipped it up the

138
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:39,240
tiniest bit and it did this little

139
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:43,959
wooo and was like

140
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:45,800

164
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:43,318
every little cross-section Marcel

165
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:45,240
actually told me um he talked about the

166
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:48,520
r aellos and the air trapping and like

167
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:50,560
the history of it from Italy and they're

168
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:52,038
they're Venetian techniques and some of

169
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,918
the older families some of the more

170
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:57,598
ancient families that knew it if once

171
00:07:54,918 --> 00:07:59,758
you came into the tutelage of the family

172
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:01,519
you literally were not allowed to leave

173
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,560
literally like you they would kill you

174
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:05,198
before you were allowed to leave because

175
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,038
of the the knowledge the sacred

176
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,520
knowledge being passed down to to the

177
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:10,560
individuals that were that were under

178
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:12,158
their tutelage so I mean like yeah like

179
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,720
these are ancient techniques like some

180
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:15,120
of the more modern techniques you know

181
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:17,800
like some of the stuff that buck does

182
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,560
make stronger you know I I don't I don't

183
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,960
know I don't think so I think it was

184
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:24,879
just to do with the actual difficulty of

185
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:26,758
it with the kind of tools and heat

186
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:30,280
sources that they had like they don't

187
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:33,000
have like crazy torches back in the

188
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:34,718
downgrading no I'm just look this Dow

189
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,559

190
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:39,640
quartz I got to say no it is I love Club

191

bangers but would you use a Club Banger

192
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:43,720
when you got one of those no I just

193
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:48,480

198
00:08:54,839 --> 00:09:00,760

261
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,320
right out front in the smoking section

343
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:32,679
like

344
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:35,039

been down it but uh I'll bring the GoPro

346
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:39,559
hopefully we'll bring you guys with us

347
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:43,720
so you can see that and uh so cool from

348
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:46,000
that to the cat to the snowmobiling to

349
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:47,720
the the ice cave to the ice cave to the

350
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,078
back country snow you need a snowmobile

351
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,079
to get to the ice cave oh yeah okay

352
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:52,838
absolutely so all need to get a

353
00:14:51,078 --> 00:14:54,359
snowmobile too snowmobile is essential

354
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:56,519
to get to the ice cave I'm thinking

355
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,199
about riding on the back of a snowmobile

356
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:59,879
nice well there's no home mobiling it's

357
00:14:58,198 --> 00:15:04,039
just

358
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:07,120
m't it's just uh side by side is what we

359
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:09,159
do side by side yeah side by side what

360
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,639
side it means one guy's holding half of

361
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:12,439
the steering wheel in the middle and

362
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,039
he's standing on one side of the sled

363
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:16,360
and the other guy's over here holding

364
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:18,559
the other middle and the other cool

365
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:21,079
there's so one of your homies has the

366
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:23,799
cliff side you know that's not you know

367
00:15:21,078 --> 00:15:26,399
what I'm saying give me the throttle

368
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:29,120

369
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:31,039

372
00:15:32,278 --> 00:15:34,759
everything like that it's one of the

373
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,959
things I'm obssed about it'll be some of

374
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:38,919
the most epic footage if we can get out

375
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:40,879
on the sleds even to just get simply out

376
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:42,879
to sprout or brandy wine which is just

377
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:44,879
the back country of Whistler just across

378
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:49,039
the seas sky highway on the other side

379
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:51,078

382
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:58,958
believe how beautiful the photos are and

383
00:15:56,679 --> 00:16:00,719

385
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,959
be very nice if we could get back there

386
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,839

mat it won't slide when you lift it up

396
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,720
on just table I think it's cuz there's

397
00:16:26,198 --> 00:16:29,559
still like it's almost like there's like

398
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,839
condensation from the amount of water

399
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:33,278
that's sitting in the bottom of all I

400
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:35,240
know is I want to rewatch the video cuz

401

this

436
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:03,400
Okay it definitely is a learning curve

437
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:06,839
to hit all of flabs glass it all has

438
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:09,320
different little nuances and trips and

439

it's I don't know Singularity is it's

440

471
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,720
absolute you got a really good hit off

472
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:41,240
that one this one has a really good hit

473
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:44,079
too yeah I just feel uncomfortable with

474
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:47,558
it because it's this one the torch it's

475
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:51,439

the sharp Parts like the teeth and the

482
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:08,240
spines and the that those are the parts

483
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,640
that are it's just a matter of being

484
