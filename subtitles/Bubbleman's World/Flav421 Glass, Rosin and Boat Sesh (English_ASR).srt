right you know it's like still to this

117
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:07,600
day if they've kept them they'll

118
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:09,520
introduce themselves as that and not as

119
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,759

121
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:16,600
like oh yeah I'm overgrow

122
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:20,520
34271 remember we were chatting like 10

123
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:22,439
years ago yep I it happens to me all the

124
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:25,000
time it's kind of the one of the

125
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:29,199
difference the differences is of meeting

126
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,959
people online versus an actual um a lot

127
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,560
of the C Community for a long time was

128
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:36,839
an online community it was a sort of a

129
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:38,720
behind the scenes back door you know no

130
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:41,279
hugely not really you know more

131
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:44,120
secretive it was it was uh you earned

132
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:47,038
the trust of people and your name was

133
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:50,800
all that you really had y well not until

134
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:52,959
like the the licenses in Canada were not

135
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,720
just out but really prevalently out you

136
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:56,680
know like a huge volume of them were out

137
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,680
or people would people even say like oh

138
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,319
yeah I even grow it you know or even

139
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,280
like if you just meet somebody body you

140
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,160
know like yeah I you don't often even

141
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:06,439
say if you smoke it you know because of

142
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,880
the potential pitfalls it could bring

143
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:09,680
yeah absolutely that's definitely one of

144
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:11,159
the things of the prohibition falling

145
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,598
and The Disappearance of prohibition

146
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,000
that I'm looking forward to seeing an

147
00:06:12,598 --> 00:06:17,439
end to oh for sure which is people being

148
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,199
worried and and I've seen it in so many

149
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:21,839
aspects I've seen The Midwives be

150
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,759
worried about you know births going

151
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:25,598
wrong and that the doctors or the nurses

152
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,038
are going to you know that they have to

153
00:06:25,598 --> 00:06:30,279
be worried and then there's the worry of

154
00:06:28,038 --> 00:06:32,120
you know the cannabis user that's

155
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:33,638
worried about maybe telling the wrong

156
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,478
person that he uses cannabis and getting

157
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:37,160
fired from his job all these silly

158
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:39,038
little like it's they're forms of

159
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:41,680
bullyism yep where it's like they're

160
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:44,439
being bullied based on something that uh

161
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,439
that they choose to to do and it's such

162
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:48,399
a beneficial plant and it's all

163
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:50,478
basically everything and like I know

164
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:52,959
like obviously I'm coming from the one

165
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:55,478
side of the pro cannabis but sure

166
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:58,560
everybody's been taught things that are

167
00:06:55,478 --> 00:07:00,120
mostly false over the last like 40 50 60

168
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,839
years of Prohibition

169
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,000
you know so a lot of the people in their

170
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:06,959
attitudes and their information is

171
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,439
coming from a fals and a falsehood in

172
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:10,598
the first place and that's where in

173
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:12,519
ultimately for me I find unfortunate you

174
00:07:10,598 --> 00:07:14,120
know like when you meet like another

175
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:15,560
family and they find out oh like you

176
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:18,240
have a medical license and all this and

177
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:20,079
all that and they might not necessarily

178
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,598
yeah be stoked they like you know like I

179
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:23,680
mean it hasn't happened with us luckily

180
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:25,560
we live in such a an understanding

181
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,199
beautiful place but I've talked to lots

182
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:31,160
of people where families haven't wanted

183
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:33,439
their kids to play with the children of

184
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:35,439
the Cannabis user for the for no other

185
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:36,839
reason other than they use cannabis and

186
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:38,120
they obviously don't use it in front of

187
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:40,439
their children and they keep it in a

188
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:42,519
safe place locked away blah blah blah

189
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:44,158
responsible as all hell but they still

190
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:46,918
you know it's like that stigma still

191
00:07:44,158 --> 00:07:48,959
exists to this day where most people

192
00:07:46,918 --> 00:07:51,478
even smoke the stuff yeah alcohol barely

193
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:53,758
get rarely gets locked up pharmaceutical

194
00:07:51,478 --> 00:07:55,639
pills rarely get locked up it's like

195
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,400
hugely that whole argument of worrying

196
00:07:55,639 --> 00:08:02,319
about children is almost you know that

197
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:05,000
the person who said that is almost

198
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:08,319
assuredly exposing their children to far

199
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,720
worse things on a daily daily basis and

200
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,439
it's just because that's the hypocrisy

201
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:14,199
of the world you know

202
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:15,598
like it's uh it definitely uh makes me

203
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:16,879
want to shake my head a little bit it

204
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:19,639
makes me want to press a little bit of

205
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:22,560
rosin is what it makes me want to do we

206
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:25,439
should uh let me go really quick I will

207
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:29,759

208
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:29,759

pause all right so we got a little bit

212
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:51,480
of this and a little bit of that I'm

213

patties well it's I was actually kind of

238
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:15,838
making a joke for a video that Darren

239
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:17,159
and I did at a dispensary and the guy

240
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,440
was like pulling out the nugs and we

241
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:20,519
were smelling them and people like I

242
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:22,560
don't want your my medicine squeezed and

243
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:24,839
put under your nose and I can totally

244
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:27,039
fully agree totally understand that uh

245
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:30,240
fully agree yeah these videos are great

246
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:31,719
for uh being criticized thank you

247
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,159
well the internet's great for

248
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:36,360
criticizing people hey but you know what

249
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:38,278
sometimes it makes things better so I do

250
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,720
I do appreciate a good critique no

251
00:10:38,278 --> 00:10:41,519
there's there's there's the give and the

252
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,879
take there's the give and the take but I

253
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,440
mean like I often wish just in and not

254
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:47,559
just you know video medium just any

255
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,959
medium out there in Internet land but I

256
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:50,199
just wish people would take 10 seconds

257
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:52,278
to think about something before they

258
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:54,440
actually say it or post it cuz often

259
00:10:52,278 --> 00:10:57,078
enough if you take that 10 seconds you

260
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:59,480
would avoid a whole lot of [ __ ] that

261
00:10:57,078 --> 00:11:04,199
you just don't need these are things we

262
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:06,720
learn as we get older true this is

263
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:09,680
true I used to be quite reactionary on

264
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:12,040
the internet when I first started me to

265
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:14,399
I've been uh I I'm much better now I try

266
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:16,319
not to be too reactive but no and even

267
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,600
if you are be like at least respectful

268
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,040
and intelligent about it instead of

269
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,959
being like well you're a [ __ ] piece

270
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:22,360
of [ __ ] [ __ ] you I don't agree with

271
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:23,479
anything you say blah blah blah blah

272
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:26,120
blah cuz it really doesn't get your

273
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:28,360
point across anyway so I think that was

274
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:31,240
the best rip I got I think I think I was

275
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:33,800
looking for that one

276
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:35,200
that it's it's it's pretty tasty it's

277
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:38,359
been cold curing in my fridge for a few

278
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:41,680
months so yeah that was uh that was good

279
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:44,120
so we've got the sasquash rosin

280
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:46,838
press I'm not sure I kind of want to

281
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,360
pull it out here just yeah it would be

282
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:50,720
so nice to just have it on that little

283
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,639
circular table or something so we'll

284
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,200
figure it out either way in a few

285
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:57,680
seconds this video is going to

286
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,000
transition into a all right so we are

287
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:02,559
doing some hillbilly oil making here

288
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,399
with the sasquash resin press right by

289
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:09,278
the ocean pretty much kind of

290
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:12,000
sweet so yeah we got her around

291
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:15,879
250° I like to start at 250 and go down

292
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,679
from there I'll go 240 230 220 uh 250 is

293
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:20,439
the higher end of your efficiency mark

294
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:24,838
on this on the temperature um yeah

295
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:26,760
Dave's uh created a little uh uh burrito

296
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:28,040
technique a directional flow package on

297
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:30,879
the inside and then we're just going to

298
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:34,759
Waterfall it down

299
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:37,439
so yeah yeah it likes to climb forward

300
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:40,399
so you want to make sure that the um the

301
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,320
screen packet is is inside the unit not

302
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:46,320
towards the edge or it pinches and it

303
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,320
breaks and uh nobody likes

304
00:12:50,198 --> 00:12:54,958
blowouts nobody likes a blowout

305
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:06,000
keep going

in to the

315
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:11,198
sasquash okay we got the the hash in the

316
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:13,919
pack here and what we're going to do is

317
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:16,639
we're just going to do a little prepress

318
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:20,639
out of the denail here

319
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:23,079
so fold that in half you want to gently

320
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,759
close that gently not on my fingers cuz

321
00:14:23,078 --> 00:14:27,599

322
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:30,360
going yeah and then all the way

323
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:33,000
down take a

324
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:35,639
that'll give us a nice nice pre-pressed

325
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,240
little piece that can go uh into the

326
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:40,839
parchment all right guys so we have

327
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:43,079

328
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:45,759
directional pack here we've got it in

329
00:14:43,078 --> 00:14:47,958
the um parchment paper and I guess we're

330
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:50,199
going to go for another little press

331
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:52,518
just a few presses for the

332
00:14:50,198 --> 00:14:55,039
day

333
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:59,159
right all right you want to hit that

334
00:14:55,039 --> 00:15:02,480
Flav and bring her down

335
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:02,480
oh she's going

336
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:17,399
down yeah hold that up perfect I think

337
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:21,159
it's good it's coming out we got

338
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:22,799
it we got it starting to come out nicely

339
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:24,278
it's a little dark in the middle there I

340
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:26,159
just want to make sure it hasn't blown

341
00:15:24,278 --> 00:15:29,399
out although we got real nice color on

342
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:29,399
this left

343
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,680
one

344
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:54,360
more sure is lovely

345
00:15:55,078 --> 00:15:59,479
looking water falls

346
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:05,159
from the first time I saw anybody do

347
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,600
this Tech making hash if the Jimmy

348
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:08,278
Hendrick song came into my head and

349
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,440
every time I see it it happens again you

350
00:16:08,278 --> 00:16:14,000
just want to crank some Jimmy while

351
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:14,000
you're doing the waterfall eh

352
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,560
yeah all right so we managed to whip off

353
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:33,159
a little bit of Rock

354
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:34,879
aan made a nice little puck here put

355
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:36,879
another nice one down here and I guess

356
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:37,720
you're pressing out this one right here

357
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:39,600
and then there's another one on the

358
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:42,000
Dabber still so maybe we better take

359
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:45,920
that one off right now

360
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:49,519
too oh yeah most just turn that around

361
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:52,399
and take that as one giant that

362
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:55,959
hey that is a giant fat dab that would

363
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:57,440
be destructive so I was going to hit a

364
00:16:55,958 --> 00:17:00,278
little bit of this one which was the

365
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,680
first one that we pressed where the um

366
00:17:00,278 --> 00:17:04,880
the little uh screen pack wasn't blowing

367
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:06,678
out but it was squeezing out the burrito

368
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,199
tube and it was just uh it was strange

369
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:10,280
i' never seen that before but it did it

370
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:12,839
twice in a row on us and uh we still

371
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:15,240
managed to harvest the majority of said

372
00:17:12,838 --> 00:17:17,480
resin well I would think so so here go

373
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:19,919
pretty tasty first first rip of the

374
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,919
fresh

375
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:28,879
press there's nothing left in this

376
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,880
little squeezed

377
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:37,359
I took some beautiful macro

378
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:40,240
photos we're going to share with you

379
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:41,639
right now the photos that I'm going to

380
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,160
share is with this actually if you look

381
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:46,799
at this Patty up close because I didn't

382
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:50,000
use heat to press it all of the bubbles

383
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:52,960
are still present Isn't that cool

384
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,599
Y and it's like this is a thick this is

385
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:58,919
a thick Patty and it is still very very

386
00:17:56,599 --> 00:18:02,279
clear it could easily be twice the size

387
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:02,280
size that it is oh easily

388
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:09,439
yeah I love the consistencies and the

389
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:13,079

bike oh yeah dude I've actually dirt

530

Coast and all over these even on gold f

532
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:28,080
for that matter in fact yesterday I was

533
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:29,558
driving by Cypress Mountain and I

534
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:31,918
thought you should just go see what's

535
00:25:29,558 --> 00:25:33,720
going on up there on my KTM boot it up

536
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:35,520
to the top and I get to the back and I'm

537
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:38,440
like there's like these rice Rockets

538
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:40,359
just like racing like literally like and

539
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:42,440
like peeling out having drag races up

540
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:44,278
there I was like damn I don't think like

541
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:47,240
many of the mountain people are like

542
00:25:44,278 --> 00:25:50,079
paying attention so I drove my bike all

543
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:52,839
up Cypress Mountain like I shred

544
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:55,079
shredded the ride shed all awesome oh

545
00:25:52,839 --> 00:25:58,000
dude it was amazing I wish that I had a

546
00:25:55,079 --> 00:25:59,798
camera I took a few shots but uh yeah

547
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,240
there's uh there's something to be said

548
00:25:59,798 --> 00:26:04,278
for being allowed to shred I think that

549
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,798
mountain could be full of bikes if they

550
00:26:04,278 --> 00:26:07,000
actually let people do that yeah that

551
00:26:05,798 --> 00:26:10,440
would be something that I would come and

552
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,240
pay for no problem sure yeah no problem

553

625
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:25,918

626
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:29,480
to just to let you

627
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:31,640
know uh you're good in two two one and

628
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:34,079
good it's like if a flab moves away from

629
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:36,200
the picture is he really even there is

630
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:37,558
he still there this is this is just

631
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:39,880
something that we always need to figure

632
00:29:37,558 --> 00:29:39,879
out you

633
00:29:45,798 --> 00:29:50,240
know

634
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:52,480
next always

635
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:56,200
down path's

636
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:58,038
next yeah that was delicious tasty yeah

637
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,600
I think it tastes better cuz a with Flo

638
00:29:58,038 --> 00:30:01,398
floating on a boat it always tastes

639
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:03,719
better on the

640
00:30:01,398 --> 00:30:06,518
ocean and it's like the first time we've

641
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:09,558
done it which is kind of like what yeah

642
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:11,558
we got to do to get like a gimal pipe

643
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:13,079
stand or something for the waves for

644
00:30:11,558 --> 00:30:15,398
sure that would be awesome like the pipe

645
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:16,918
just doesn't move at all always this is

646
00:30:15,398 --> 00:30:18,918
really good though this is like a solid

647
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:20,840
base a creative one this one it's see

648
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:23,038
it's the it's the equivalent of taking

649
00:30:20,839 --> 00:30:24,519
something and moving with it you know

650
00:30:23,038 --> 00:30:27,038
you do something that's kind of like

651
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:29,000
okay it might not be the most convenient

652
00:30:27,038 --> 00:30:30,599
or maybe it's but it leads you to the

653
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,038
next stage to the next stage and it's

654
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:34,839
interesting because I saw D talking the

655
00:30:33,038 --> 00:30:36,879
other day and how he's like I'm ready to

656

686
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:50,320
what you're not supposed to do

687
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:55,798
okay that is

688
00:31:53,839 --> 00:31:58,480
delicious

689
00:31:55,798 --> 00:31:59,879
right think's a chugger too it feels

690
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,278
like first of all that someone's handing

691
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:05,440
you like a tank yeah it's just like what

692
00:32:02,278 --> 00:32:07,919
is this like it's weighty AES there's a

693
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:10,240
lot of Bor in there MH a lot of work in

694
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:13,159
there for sure there's even space rocks

695
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:17,159
and space rocks and space rocks yeah

696
00:32:13,159 --> 00:32:19,120
well no space sand ah yes that's been

697
00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:20,760
heated up from a meteorite I actually

698
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:22,719
have chunks of meteorite and it looks

699
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:24,879
quite different from Mite multivites

700
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,839
like when a meteor Just Smokes this

701
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:29,440
Sandy Beach and it just like melts the

702
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:31,839
sand into that crazy easy like it's

703
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:33,360
pretty cool definitely couldn't happen

704
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:36,558
without the meteor well maybe it could

705
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:38,839
if we did like created some or something

706
00:32:36,558 --> 00:32:40,798
but the meteor is definitely important

707
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:43,000
in that

708
00:32:40,798 --> 00:32:45,759
aspect pretty

709
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:48,319
interesting

710
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:51,359

places no I don't really use

712
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:59,079

713
00:32:55,398 --> 00:32:59,079

the whole purpose take your time yep

762
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:23,000
although how worried are you paying

763
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:26,000
attention to what's in front of you at

764
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,119
all times you know I watch a fa bit but

765
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,800
you're also not going very fast so you

766
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:32,440
do hit something you're just going to

767
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,440
push it out of the

768
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:39,279
way interes you definitely should

769
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:43,079
be no it's ideal not to hit them in your

770
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:45,240
boat oh this is nice last boat your dad

they're huge

792
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:32,519
dud my boy had his legs hanging off the

793
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,160
front and uh we're going over the waves

794
00:36:32,519 --> 00:36:36,079
and two of them came right up and are

795
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:37,639
like a foot or two from his feet and

796
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:40,400
they just looked and then they both like

797
00:36:37,639 --> 00:36:41,879
jetted in opposite direction screen he's

798
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,280
like [ __ ] his pants [ __ ] our

799

801
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:49,920
they're like they're right dud if you're

802
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:51,720
close to them like I came around a

803
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,960
corner on a kayak I was kayaking with a

804
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:56,239
friend and he was like you're about to

805
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:57,880
come face to face with a giant sea lion

806
00:36:56,239 --> 00:37:00,118
big and I'm paddling and I'm like it's

807
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:02,920
probably a seal bro we don't have

808
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:05,200
seal and I went around this corner and

809
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:07,800
this thing it must be like I'm guessing

810

2,000 lb they're big dude they're

811

frighteningly Big Dave like I basically

812
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:13,720
felt like if it just rolled off the rock

813
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
I would have been dead yeah like it's

814
00:37:13,719 --> 00:37:17,719
funny cuz we started the one side and

815
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,838
there's nothing but seals so we're

816
00:37:17,719 --> 00:37:21,358
watching every they're super calm small

817
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:23,440

818
00:37:21,358 --> 00:37:24,679
like chilling the're little babies yeah

819
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,800
and then we get around the corner and

820
00:37:24,679 --> 00:37:28,239
there's that one spot it's all sea lions

821
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:31,200
and as soon as they see us there's so

822
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:33,318
much aggression like the big ones biting

823
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:35,799
like other ones like it was just like

824
00:37:33,318 --> 00:37:39,039
can you imagine being a seal in a sea

825

down

829
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:49,039
below was like the craziest sea Li orgy

830
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:51,880
down there

831
00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:53,440
just there's a big one that happens down

832
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:56,280
uh off the coast of teina when you

833
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:58,318

rock that if you go by plane it's unreal

837
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,599
how many sea lions fit on this thing

838
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,480
it's just a Flat Rock that just barely

839
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:11,119
sticks out of the water and there's

840
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:12,760
hundreds of them you know hundreds of

841
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:16,318
them yeah this morning I probably seen

842
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:18,440
like 300 seals on that one rock and then

843
00:38:16,318 --> 00:38:20,679
there was probably about like 60 sea

liines nature yeah see you know it's

845
00:38:20,679 --> 00:38:23,960
exciting to see like some of these

846
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:27,118
things I swear when people you know the

847
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:29,240
joke about have you done it on weed have

848

weed well it's kind of like there's

850
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:36,480
certain things that you do in life that

851
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:38,440
stimulate the end aboid system there's

852
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,440
certain foods that you can eat that

853
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:42,760
stimulate the endoc canabo system you

854
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:45,039
got to think that that's kind of like

855
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:46,000
probably what sites that stimulate you

856
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:47,239
know what I mean you end up doing this

857
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,679
really cool thing it's like snowboard is

858
00:38:47,239 --> 00:38:52,159
cool but have you done it on weed yeah

left it at

870
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:17,239
home I was and I was thinking about

871
00:39:15,719 --> 00:39:18,959
bringing some cuz I was thinking I got

872
00:39:17,239 --> 00:39:20,598
my cousin for the first time and his

873
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:22,599
wife for the first time when we went to

874
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:24,119
thorman be yeah so it was like late at

875
00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:26,599
night campfire and they got their first

876
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:28,519
DNT experience it's pretty it's kind of

877
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:29,838
magical is magical and it's it's

878
00:39:28,519 --> 00:39:31,639
unfortunate that of course they've

879
00:39:29,838 --> 00:39:34,599
treated psychedelics much the same way

880
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:37,719
they've treated cannabis you know as uh

881
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:40,000
any opposing sacrament to the sacrament

882
00:39:37,719 --> 00:39:41,559
of you know the the blood of Christ or

883
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,559
whatever the wine sacrament of the

884
00:39:41,559 --> 00:39:45,799
Christians seems to have gone into every

885
00:39:43,559 --> 00:39:47,880
culture and been like let's just get rid

886
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:49,839
of that Sacrament that Sacrament all of

887
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:51,838
these plant sacraments were taken away

888
00:39:49,838 --> 00:39:53,679
and made to look like more like a crime

889
00:39:51,838 --> 00:39:55,480
or made to look you know that you're

890
00:39:53,679 --> 00:39:57,440
you're a lesser of a you're not a good

891
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:59,480
person to if you do those substances and

892
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:01,760
it's it's so quite the opposite in the

893
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:04,119
sense much like cannabis that they're

894
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:06,599
they're incredible spiritual it's

895
00:40:04,119 --> 00:40:08,318
uplifting moments man connectors you

896
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:10,960
know they allow people to connect to

897
00:40:08,318 --> 00:40:13,800
their spiritual like seeing demons and

898
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:15,800
like talking to the devil and how they

899
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:17,560
right they're terrified of those oh yeah

900
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:19,720
no absolutely I've you know cuz they're

901
00:40:17,559 --> 00:40:21,960
humbling to the ego I mean I myself have

902
00:40:19,719 --> 00:40:24,078
had humbling psychedelic experiences not

903
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:27,519
what I would call a bad trip but what I

904
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:31,160
would call extremely like educational

905
00:40:27,519 --> 00:40:35,519
and um intensely intimate and spiritual

906
00:40:31,159 --> 00:40:37,279
like to to in a way that's much more uh

907
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:38,719
spiritual in the way that religion was

908
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,280
trying to jam it down my throat when I

909
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:41,679
was young being raised Catholic and

910
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:43,319
going to Sunday school I was just kind

911
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:45,799
of like this does not

912
00:40:43,318 --> 00:40:47,239
feel like the right you feel it in your

913
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:49,280
whole body if you're not using

914
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:50,598
psychedelics for that like in that way

915
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,200
for that reason I think you're going

916
00:40:50,599 --> 00:40:53,960
about it wrong I mean a lot of the kids

917
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:56,480
nowadays not kids like we're [ __ ]

918
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:59,440
young too but a lot of the people I go

919
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:01,119
any time now yeah go but um man it's

920
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:05,119
like I sit there and like they khole for

921
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:07,240
fun yeah it's like like why well you

922
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:09,760
know I mean I have to say that before I

923
00:41:07,239 --> 00:41:11,399
did it as a educational tool before I

924
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:14,000
learned about Terrence McKenna and stuff

925
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:16,599
I was also doing it for fun and I would

926
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,000
only not knock doing it for fun uh in

927
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:19,640
the beginning at least because it's a

928
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,400
great way I'm not knocking doing it for

929
00:41:19,639 --> 00:41:23,559
fun I'm knocking getting like totally

930
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:26,039
like a you're saying [ __ ] yeah

931
00:41:23,559 --> 00:41:29,159
thinking it like too far that's not for

932
00:41:26,039 --> 00:41:32,119
some form of like interal perspective

933
00:41:29,159 --> 00:41:33,799
that's why I stated early on yes oh yeah

934
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:35,559
if it was to go on and on and on like

935
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,760
that it ends up being well hey

936
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:38,239
everyone's different you know and it's

937
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:40,440
hard to judge anyone on their

938
00:41:38,239 --> 00:41:41,879
psychedelic use I personally at one

939
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:44,480
point in time was doing mushrooms like

940
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:46,400
four or five times a week growing my own

941
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:48,039
mushrooms that I ordered from they grew

942
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,318
everywhere around here growing up too

943
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:51,400
like we were all picking them

944
00:41:49,318 --> 00:41:54,838
skateboarding around everywhere like

945
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:56,559
awesome months of when I learned we used

946
00:41:54,838 --> 00:41:58,639
to come from Manitoba to pick mushrooms

947
00:41:56,559 --> 00:42:01,199
in DC you know to give you an idea of

948
00:41:58,639 --> 00:42:03,559
how special it was to us we had patches

949
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:05,960
like across from our high school yeah we

950
00:42:03,559 --> 00:42:07,960
have that in Ontario unfortunately I

951
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:10,079
ended up finding the largest patch of

952
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:11,679
mushrooms ever that I ever found they

953
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:14,200
were cyan Essence and they were in the

954
00:42:11,679 --> 00:42:16,480
multiple pounds like probably 10 to 15

955
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:18,439
lbs and I say probably because someone

956
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:20,639
else got them and that's how we found

957
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:22,960
them it was a grow house that my partner

958
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:25,318
and I had on M Seymour Parkway right on

959
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:26,800
