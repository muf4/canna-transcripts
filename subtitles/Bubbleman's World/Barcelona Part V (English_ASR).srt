Hey guys, Bubble Man here. I just got to

3
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,518
the Spanibus Fair. I missed yesterday

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,359
unfortunately, but ended up having a

5
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:32,159
great day spending with friends Ramon

6
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:34,399
and Ricki. I bumped into Jiga and Flux,

7
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,398
you guys have seen on the last video.

8
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:39,759
And got myself a nice little table set

9
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:41,679
up with the Davinator and water hatch.

10
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:43,839
Wait for people to come up and say hi.

11
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:45,920
And I guess we'll photograph and video

12
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,360
some dabs and we'll see what people are

13
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,920
doing. Hopefully Jeff Church shows up

14
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:52,479
later and we do a little bit more rosin.

15
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:56,160
And uh yeah, just stay tuned. We're

16
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:56,159
going to have a lot of fun here today.

17
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:08,158
Heat

18
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:11,519
up

19
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:27,079
here. It's the 90.

20
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:30,599
Which one did you put in the super club?

21
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:34,719
The

22
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:38,639
90 figure. Interesting that the 90 cakes

23
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:41,478
faster than Oh, this one. This one's got

24
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,000
This one was has been open now for 3

25
00:01:41,478 --> 00:01:47,359
days. This one's still on its second

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
day. Oh, wow.

27
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:54,399
Interesting. So, she's got the Waro. The

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,799
Waro crumbled right away. Really?

29
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:59,879
Whoa. It's just It's just It's just Holy

30
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:04,520
[ __ ]

31
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:04,519
Surprised. Looks like waxies.

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,360
Yeah. It smells smells so good, dude. It

33
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:13,920
looks smells so a lot of email dabs

34
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:17,080
right there. So, I need some new I need

35
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:17,079
some new

36
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,080
Yeah.

37
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:30,318
Booyah. I just want to smoke it. I'm

38
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,040
always happy when the great gardeners

39
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:34,719
come

40
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:37,199
by. Do you have a zap tool around? Yes.

41
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:39,039
There's one right here. No problem.

42
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:42,079
Sometimes with that, you just heat it up

43
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:45,878
a little bit first.

44
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,879
Oh, did that smell good?

45
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:50,979
Wow. Nice work. That was like

46
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,680
professional. Oh yeah.

47
00:02:50,979 --> 00:02:57,719
[Applause]

48
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,719
It takes a gentle hand.

49
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,560
It's cool. They got a sexy guy. Yeah.

50
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:14,239
Both of us. Those guys are so awesome,

51
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,598
too. Like a local Spanish bag company

52
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,759
both came over. They brought me a little

53
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:22,919
bit of hash, which to be honest, I've

54
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:22,919
been smoking. You want to try it?

55
00:03:29,158 --> 00:03:36,598
Yeah. I'm not letting go. Yeah, exactly.

56
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:40,840
Good call. I don't know

57
00:03:36,598 --> 00:03:40,839
how that's all.

58
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:07,039
Yeah, it's true. Matt's just doing this

59
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,640
all over. He's probably been at three

60
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:13,719
booths doing this in the last half

61
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:17,598
hour. Just roll around and barb people

62
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:17,598
down. You're getting barbed

63
00:04:19,478 --> 00:04:24,599
up. You got like 100 people, dude.

64
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:46,160
getting barbed

65
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:54,520
up. We should learn how to say hold it

66
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,520
in in Spanish.

67
00:04:55,839 --> 00:05:00,599
Barbara.

68
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:04,560
Barbara

69
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:06,800
bud. It just sounds so awesome. This is

70
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,800
like Canadian accent. It's like Barbra

71
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:14,160
by just a barb.

72
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:16,560
Barb, what are you doing? Barb. Jesus.

73
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,680
That guy's like out. I like how they run

74
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,680
away after they take a

75
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:32,280
hit. Hell yeah, they

76
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:32,280
do. These guys are down for the bob.

77
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,720
This was one person standing here when

78
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:38,079
he started this. It's literally like

79
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,240
one. He's like, "Hey, you want to hit

80
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:41,240
the barb?"

81
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:50,399
What is that? It's the barber, bud.

82
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:52,639
Working on the mother ship. Trying to

83
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:55,120
get my own mother ship. So all these

84
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,759
guys saying mother ship, dude, the

85
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,160
mothership and the barb, they coalesque.

86
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:03,360
Just trying to get my own mother ship. I

87
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:07,039
think we can make it happen.

88
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,038
Oh [ __ ]

89
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:29,400
[ __ ] Well, it's been 4 minutes, Matt.

90
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:29,399
You've been going pretty strong.

91
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:50,400
There's better than sign an autograph.

92
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,800
Way better. Yeah, you can have a picture

93
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:56,279
or

94
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,280
Yeah. Barb.

95
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:05,520
Yep. And I'm happy to say that it tastes

96
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:06,800
like that when I grow it, too. So, it's

97
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:08,719
like, you know, it's good to know that

98
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,120
you can get the seeds and then actually

99
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,360
get that strain.

100
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,199
Yeah. Cuz I don't think of myself as a

101
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,639
really amazing grower. I hadn't grown

102
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:21,120
for a long time. I bar both that Afghani

103
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,639
and barber and you you kill the plants

104
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,598
and overwater them and do all these

105
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:28,840
things and then don't expect to to grow

106
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:28,839
the fire.

107
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,960
5 minutes 30 seconds.

108
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:38,360
I think you got some people doubling up.

109
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:38,359
Oh my god.

110
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:46,840
Watching the video.

111
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:46,839
I don't know.

112
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,000
I wasn't watching either.

113
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:59,038
Maybe. Yeah. I'm not a big oil guy, so

114
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,038
I don't really

115
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:08,440
know. Take it easy, guys.

116
00:08:12,339 --> 00:08:15,429
[Music]

117
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:32,759
Too bad this forbat.

118
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:48,319
We got to stop for a little while only

119
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:52,600
because this is getting Yeah. Let's take

120
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,600
a break. Break time.

121
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:58,000
Good. And it took me like 2 weeks to

122
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:59,600
[ __ ] for a leg to heal. I was

123
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,839
expecting a bruise to come up. Hey, look

124
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,879
who it is. Hey, what's up, dude? Dude, I

125
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,560
just thought we better get a little bit

126
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:06,720
of footage for Bubble Man's World. Dude,

127
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:08,239
a man show what his heads have been

128
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,839
saying. Drew's in the house. What do we

129
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,839
got here, buddy? This is a little bit of

130
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,760
Neville's Haze heads. This is like after

131
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:16,399
the material's been beat up about five

132
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:18,480
times to get heads off. Uh, and we just

133
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,799
went in again and dug it up real more,

134
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,720
then done a static trick on it. And then

135
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:24,799
once we had the pile, we put it through

136
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,639
the static trick again and that got out

137
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:28,399
a lot of the green contaminant. Game

138
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:30,000
changer on that, eh? Yeah. Yeah. We were

139
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,000
a bit disappointed with Neville's haze

140
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,080
yields. We've been getting crazy like 5

141
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,320
to 10% on things like the Nicole and

142
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,240
24K. And then we had a super frosty

143
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,040
Neville's haze and we got like a

144
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:45,360
percent. Wow. 2% something like that.

145
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:46,559
Let's hit that. Let's do it.

146
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,959
All right. So, what do we got right

147
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:53,000
there? Yeah, that's amazing. All right.

148
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:53,000
Here. You get to be my cameraman.

149
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:59,080
Wait, this is I think I think this

150
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,679
is

151
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:07,240
beautiful. Haze is one of my favorite

152
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:07,239
suits. My son's middle

153
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:23,958
really. My wife chose it too. No joke.

154
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:26,399
My wife chose a

155
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:30,039
really joke. She said, "Yeah, it always

156
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,039
makes you so happy.

157
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:35,599
No

158
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,600
posters

159
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:43,680
that really

160
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:45,559
old by us in South Spain. Smells

161
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:49,919
beautiful. It's got

162
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:52,159
that very Amsterdam coffee shop smell,

163
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:52,159
doesn't

164
00:10:53,078 --> 00:10:56,958
it? It reminds me of the

165
00:10:57,078 --> 00:11:00,479
SK. Bring

166
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
back great gardener in turn for a little

167
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:14,879
truth. Pretty good time here at lots of

168
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:16,958
people are coming up showing me hash and

169
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:19,039
bud coming and asking about the bags

170
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:21,599
obviously talking about hash church and

171
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:23,759
man's world. It's really cool how many

172
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,720
uh people were actually able to touch

173
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:29,240
this audience. It is the YouTube

174
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:33,000
channel. Very cool.

175
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:37,680
Awesome. So many people

176
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,679
watching everyone see some

177
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:42,519
hands always.

178
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:50,078
[Music]

179
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,440
All right. So this gentleman just walked

180
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:55,759
up to me and he

181
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:57,279
is Max from Davinator. He's the

182
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:58,799
gentleman that sent me the Davinator

183
00:11:57,278 --> 00:11:59,879
from Germany. So, of course, he wants to

184
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:02,879
give a shout

185
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:05,360
out. Thank you very much. You know, I

186
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:09,320
broke my deep dish banger the other day

187
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:12,959
cuz the element got stuck on it and

188
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:15,360
you bowl the only bowl I have to smoke.

189
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:16,799
So, thanks to you, I'm smoking right

190
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,200
now. So, maybe we should take a little

191
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:20,199
dab. Okay.

192
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,919
Let me load you up with something first.

193
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:35,599
Max from the Yeah, this is the barb.

194
00:12:33,278 --> 00:12:37,360
All right, here you go. Mothership. And

195
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,240
this is a mother ship. Yeah. First time

196
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,240
for me. Oh,

197
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:56,519
nice. Woohoo.

198
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,519
Davinator, show us that shirt.

199
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:01,039
There it is.

200
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:03,838
Excellent. And did Brian from Dail ever

201
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:06,958
get in touch with you? Did Brian from

202
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:08,720
Dail? He's going to. Yeah, I know. He

203
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:10,078
wants to talk to you and and figure some

204
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,680
things out or whatever. So, yeah, he

205
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:13,199
liked your unit and that you were using

206
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:15,759
good components and that you weren't

207
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,560
just copying and, you know, making it

208
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:23,600
cheap. So, it's cool. We'll hopefully

209
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:23,599
hook you guys up. Yeah. Right on, man.

210
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:32,240
videos. What is the word? Uh, just love

211
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:34,639
bubs. This one's the tri. So, we got

212
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,879
Doug from THC and Hemp Puddlum here in

213
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,879
the booth. He's showing us some fire.

214
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:41,278
This is the bubble gum. Little bubble

215
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:44,078
gum. And this is the bubblegum hash that

216
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:46,320
won third place in the resin category. I

217
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:48,719
have to say, he just gave me a piece and

218
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,480
it is definitely like I'm pretty darn

219
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,480
happy. Most pieces of hash I'm a little

220
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:56,639
less than happy. This one I'm very happy

221
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,759
to see. Here's the L. Oh, L.

222
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,720
Did you have something to do with this,

223
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,720
Julian?

224
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:06,839
L. So, this was

225
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:13,599
that has a little bit of that. It's

226
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:17,120
So, what did you do for that? How did we

227
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:20,399
make Lage? Making Bas country. Basque

228
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:24,159
country. So, this is also Basque.

229
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:27,440
There we are. When you want to squeeze

230
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:29,278
if you want make videos the same you go

231
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,839
in my home. It's far away though, eh?

232
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:34,958
Yes. We'll think about it. It would be

233
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:38,240
nice. Be nice.

234
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:40,638
I have your bag for Yeah. You go in my

235
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,959
home for make.

236
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,879
That'd be awesome. You'll film this for

237
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:46,399
me? Yes, of course. We're filming this

238
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:49,198
right now. So, we got Jeff Church in the

239
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:51,278
booth. He has come by. Doug just offered

240
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:53,679
me a few buds and we're going to squeeze

241
00:14:51,278 --> 00:14:55,759
rosin out of it. You really want to see

242
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:58,159
this, dude. I'm telling you. I made some

243
00:14:55,759 --> 00:15:00,559
earlier with this shitty Moroccan hash.

244
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:03,439
Squeeze oil out onto this in 5 seconds.

245
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:06,958
Dabs of it. Okay. Yeah. Like Moroccan

246
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:09,199
hash oil, but it looks like what the

247
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:11,479
truth is here. Do you want me to Yeah.

248
00:15:09,198 --> 00:15:14,958
Yeah. Which one? This

249
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:17,039
is what the truth. Oh, church is just

250
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:18,958
going to be online. It's at uh the Hash

251
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:22,639
Museum, but it's not open to the public.

252
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:25,198
Ah, on the line YouTube. Yeah. All

253
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:27,839
right. So, you got the bud. We got the

254
00:15:25,198 --> 00:15:30,000
bud. And then what is that? That's the

255
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,519
bubble gum. Barcelona bubblegum. Right.

256
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,720
Yeah. Right. Not the bask. That one's

257
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,720
real nice. Almost a little more

258
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:41,039
fruity. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. There it is.

259
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:44,919
All right. You want to do it up on the

260
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:44,919
table so everyone can see?

261
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:53,920
All

262
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:56,480
right. Pop the flower in here.

263
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:59,679
All right. So, flowers in. This is uh

264
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:02,000
the soil grown rosin technique. Yes.

265
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:07,958
Soil grown 2015. Thanks, buddy. Thank

266
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:12,039
you. Soil grown. And then one, two,

267
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:12,039
three. All right.

268
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:20,078
Dab. Dab. Sit. Right there. Rosin.

269
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:22,240
Rosin. Yes. All right. I want a dab of

270
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:23,679
that. Yeah. Yeah. Here you go, buddy.

271
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,879
Maybe clean that up. Excuse me. I threw

272
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:28,638
the butt on the hash. No

273
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:31,919
worries. See that? He melt the oil right

274
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:34,720
out of the bud. Doug, fresh. Fresh. No

275
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:36,559
solvent.

276
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,320
Just give that a wipe with your fingers.

277
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:40,638
Yeah.

278
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:43,920
I don't, but we could rip a piece off if

279
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:45,680
you want. So, this is to show that it's

280
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:47,599
real bubble gum. It sticks to the

281
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:49,359
bottom. Nice. I like that you got your

282
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,959
med.

283
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:54,480
Yeah, John. Johnny B. Yeah, man. But

284
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:55,919
then you know it's bubblegum. You can

285
00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:00,000
stick to the bottom. If you can put

286
00:16:55,919 --> 00:17:02,399
posters up with it, then it's all good.

287
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,638
Maders.

288
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,638
Yeah, brother.

289
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:12,640
Yeah, Revlon. He gets the good one. Jeff

290
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,640
Church doesn't [ __ ] around. It was

291
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,160
actually the cheap one. Can you imagine

292
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,799
one day where Jeff could be like a

293
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:21,089
Revlon model like holding one of these

294
00:17:18,798 --> 00:17:24,168
up? When I crimped my

295
00:17:21,088 --> 00:17:24,168
[Applause]

296
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:30,400
bud for press, the isolator is good.

297
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:32,720
This Yeah, but we squeezed the hash. We

298
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,480
squeezed oil out of It's sticky. Yeah.

299
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,558
Oh, it's sticky. He's Watch how easy he

300
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,200
picks it up. No salt. No solder. It's

301
00:17:36,558 --> 00:17:41,759
like wax. No salt. Yeah, it's parchment.

302
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:45,038
But you can also use the Teflon, which

303
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:48,679
is oil slick. Yeah, they both work. This

304
00:17:45,038 --> 00:17:48,679
one works good, too.

305
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:59,319
Crazy.

306
00:18:01,798 --> 00:18:06,720
picture of

307
00:18:04,038 --> 00:18:08,440
the second.

308
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,798
Yeah, it just happens

309
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:13,440
perfectly. Fact that it was a bud in his

310
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:17,839
jar like 8 minutes ago. Now it's going

311
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,840
to be a dab in my lungs like 10 seconds

312
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:35,639
later. Man, 25 years we've been doing

313
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:35,640
that. That's pretty [ __ ] nuts.

314
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,240
Oh my

315
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:45,880
god. No, I better

316
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:49,200
not like living

317
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:49,200
hash. Living

318
00:18:49,558 --> 00:18:53,558
hash something.

319
00:18:58,599 --> 00:19:05,240
Oo, scraping it off the bank and

320
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,240
collecting it as a clear oil.

321
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:10,319
Yeah, very good. If you learn the

322
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:12,480
technique, the smaller the bud, the more

323
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:15,879
return. Okay. Too big of a bud and then

324
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,880
it gets caught.

325
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,960
They still take this and smoke it with

326
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:23,038
someone that or use it in an edible or

327
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:26,160
coconut oil. There's still some

328
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:29,160
medicine, but this is top quality

329
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,160
medicine.

330
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,000
Anyway, you know, you going for another

331
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,120
squish here. I just turned it off cuz

332
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,319
I'm worried that you're going to heat it

333
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:44,079
up too hot. Careful cuz if it smokes the

334
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:47,119
thing, it's there's too much power going

335
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:49,199
through it. That's all.

336
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:53,119
I just turned it back on, too. So, a

337
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,120
fast bubble might be good.

338
00:19:54,798 --> 00:20:01,599
Yeah, there's some more rosin. Yeah,

339
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:04,918
probably 50% of what it just gave us.

340
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:04,918
It's not bad.

341
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:24,640
It's It's It's like a gas color.

342
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:27,360
Rossin.

343
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:30,159
Oh, what's this for? To rosin.

344
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:34,918
Okay, he'll do it. One second. Uh, he

345
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:34,919
wants you to try this, bud. Uh, Jeff,

346
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:43,239
just a little bit. Okay.

347
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:46,319
Well, a little bit, you know, not too

348
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:49,279
much. Or you open it and nothing's

349
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:52,000
there. So, it's just a little bit. Press

350
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:53,519
this one next. Yeah, he just That's his.

351
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:58,640
Press it up and give him a dab. Yeah,

352
00:20:53,519 --> 00:21:01,519
for sure. Fresh serve dabs. Fresh dabs.

353
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,120
We're making hash. Careful. You want to

354
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:05,038
be really solid with this pipe. Never

355
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:08,479
really hit it from a weird angle. It's

356
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:10,000
how the pipe will.

357
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,798
The first person that hit it today

358
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,519
dropped this on the table. I was so glad

359
00:21:12,798 --> 00:21:18,240
it didn't break cuz that's all the it's

360
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:22,599
the only piece I have.

361
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,599
So, what we got? Press it up.

362
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:26,759
Yeah. Nice.

363
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:31,558
Yeah.

364
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:34,000
Give me that thing on the right there.

365
00:21:31,558 --> 00:21:37,038
Yeah. Wait. Oh, here. I'll clean it.

366
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,880
Yes. My fingers are available. I can do

367
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:40,640
it, too. If you want to keep yours clean

368
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,720
off cuz you're operating the rosin and

369
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:45,759
stuff. It's fine. Operating the ro.

370
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,200
You're a rosin tech. Terry. Rossin

371
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:48,558
technician. Yeah. Terry will have a

372
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,400
machine that he's going to be building.

373
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:52,639
He'll be like, "Wait, I'm building a

374
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,240
machine, mate." I'm like, "Dude, like

375
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:58,080
your water extraction machine, dude.

376
00:21:54,240 --> 00:22:00,079
Just sell the [ __ ] bags."

377
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:01,599
That's what I said to Terry. He was

378
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:02,960
supposed to be the guy to sell the bags

379
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:04,558
in the beginning and then instead of

380
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:08,000
selling the bags, he was like, "I'm

381
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:10,119
going to build a machine."

382
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,279
Okay. Of course, you

383
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:15,839
never dude. At this point in our life,

384
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:20,440
we know that the majority of the great

385
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:20,439
ideas we have is super

386
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,720
I can't exude

387
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:37,759
narrowing. You got some flavors. Yeah.

388
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:39,599
Excellent. Excellent.

389
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:44,759
Always some good good representatives

Yeah. But Roz, did you see that guy's

393
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:58,000
bud that we just squeezed? Where did he

394
00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:01,480
get a hit? Awesome. I should have I

395
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,480
should have done that.

396
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:07,918
Very nice. You make these in Italy?

397
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:10,000
Where where was this from? From Spain.

398
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:12,400
Oh, from Spain. Barcelona. Old Rock

399
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,440
Platinum Ice Water.

400
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:18,320
Very nice. Nice. Nice little res. It's

so that's someone else. What happens

404
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:29,440

405
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:30,960
screen. You want? Yeah, let's do

406
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,960
something. Let me press this really

407
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,679
quick cuz I I promised it would happen.

408
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:37,360
But then 2

409
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:40,559
seconds. I got a fresh part for that

410
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:43,599
stuff. Nice.

411
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:46,599
I wonder the the mother ship. This is a

Yeah. You ready, Bubble Man?

415
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:09,839
That's enough for me. I don't need to

416
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:12,320
like take it off cuz I want everyone

417
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:14,879

418
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:17,200
lage actually. Here.

419

423
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:38,000

Okay. So, go ahead and like whatever you

Nice.

431
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:11,038
I had one right here. I got

432
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:12,880
Doug. Always a pleasure, brother.

433
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:15,119
Beautiful. Thank you for coming by and

434
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:18,080

435
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:22,439
dude.

436
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:22,439
Doug started the party. Very nice.

437
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:38,880
Oh, all the great familiar faces. This

438
00:25:35,278 --> 00:25:40,720
is good times right now. I don't mind. I

439
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,320
don't mind.

440
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,798
Careful with that. It's going to be like

441
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:47,918
nothing we've ever used. You think it'll

442
00:25:44,798 --> 00:25:49,759
be runny? I think you should use this

443
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:51,278
for that. Oh, it's going to be runny,

444
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:53,119
bro. This is going to be the stuff that

445
00:25:51,278 --> 00:25:56,000
makes someone pass out unconscious when

446
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:59,439
they dab it. Trust me.

447
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:02,960
Second winner. Stab a dude in Barcelona.

448
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:04,880
We're going to rosen it. Oh wow. Imagine

449
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:08,400
you take your entry and you rosen it

450
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:11,278
before you enter it. Jesus. Whose bus

451
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:14,080
was that one? That one was his. The

452
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:16,798
sage. Yeah. Let's hit. You take that and

453
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:16,798
I'll get him.

454
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:24,440
I'm going to wait until the

455
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:24,440
video see

456
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:33,439
how we have different texts. Jeff. Yeah.

457
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,799
I like yours though, man. You know, the

458
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,720
first time I tried to use it, I ripped

459
00:26:34,798 --> 00:26:38,798
the paper like an idiot. That's the best

460
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,880
thing about hashish. Everybody has a

461
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:43,200
different tech because they did it, you

462
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,960
know, or they saw everybody do it. But

463
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,120
you know, like it's it's all rushing

464
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,440
over time. A lot of time it's just what

465
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:53,239
you had lying around.

466
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,240
What can I do right now?

467
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:04,720
Juliet. Oh my god. Look, it's [ __ ]

468
00:27:00,599 --> 00:27:07,038
through without without me even. Look at

469
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,759
this.

470
00:27:07,038 --> 00:27:11,759
That is pre There we go. Pre

471
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:13,519
pre-pressed. There's already rust and

472
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:17,599
greasing out. So, this is going to be

473
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:19,679
epic right here. Barbs and Okay, Barbs.

474
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:22,000
This is my first time. This is my first

475
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,600
time on the Teflon. We're making Be

476
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,200
careful with the heat on this one. It's

477
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:28,000
not going to be like bud. Let's Let's

478
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,519
go. Little shots. Let's Yeah. And you

479
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,880
You're welcome to use the smaller one if

480
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:32,720
you want. No, this is good. Just real

481
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:35,760
little shots.

482
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:37,759
Nice. This is going to be nuts. Don't

483
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:39,440
smoke it too much.

484
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:42,480
Oh, I can't wait for the money shot when

485
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:44,880
he opens this. Let's take a peek. Hold

486
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,880
on. One

487
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:55,879
more. Wow. And there's a lot more to go.

488
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:55,879
Oh. Oh.

489
00:27:57,159 --> 00:28:06,039
Jesus. Jesus Christ. Set that there.

490
00:28:00,798 --> 00:28:06,038
We'll get a couple dabs. Take a shot.

491
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,599
Smells

492
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:13,519
awesome. Look at that. It looks like

493
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:17,918
like a marking a chef would put on a

494
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:20,960
dessert with like the raspberry [ __ ]

495
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:23,759
the mango one cake resin, right? And

496
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:26,798
[ __ ] turn it into just So now Matt

497
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:28,839
knows why he would take his six-star and

498
00:28:26,798 --> 00:28:32,839
turn it to 10

499
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:32,839
star. Damn.

500
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:38,960
Damn. I mean, I haven't hit it yet, but

501
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:42,000
I have to admit like this could [ __ ]

502
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:45,519
someone up. This

503
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,759
first [ __ ] someone up. Yeah.

504
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:52,639
Holy Christ.

505
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:54,480
That's just like the Shiva snot. Wow.

506
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:57,200
It's just so dummy. Yeah. Push it down

507
00:28:54,480 --> 00:29:00,720
and and pick it up like snap. You know

508
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:02,720
what I mean? Like flat the way you were.

509
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:05,200
Yeah. And just tap it down like push it

510
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:07,600
down and then lift it up. Here, let me

511
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:10,640
show you. Yeah, it doesn't seem packed

512
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:12,879
or something.

513
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:15,520
There he goes. Now he's got it. Oh, it's

514
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:17,039
really tiring. Yeah, it's like insane.

515
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:20,839
Here, I'm just going to go for this

516
00:29:17,038 --> 00:29:20,839
little section here.

517
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:24,799
That's a nice

518
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:34,879
one. Someone hold this so I can do the

519
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:34,880
camera. So, pipe. Thank you, Judia.

520
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,890
[Music]

521
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:49,960
Ready. Take one. Barbs

522
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:49,960
in. Barb.

523
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:17,398
We just made rosin at a bar full melt.

524
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:25,840
Talk about a good time to roll up,

525
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:27,919
Joseph. Woo!

526
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:30,918
Dude, that that's strong as [ __ ] isn't

527
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:30,919
it?

528
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:39,839
It's different. Changed it. Changed

529
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:42,480
totally. You got rid of all the wax

530
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:44,798
membranes. The carbs that lights up the

531
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,558
face sort of has changed it a little

532
00:30:44,798 --> 00:30:49,798
bit. I got to try this guy. Yeah, of

533
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:49,798
course, dude.

534
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,839
See this

535
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:03,840
is still

536
00:31:07,079 --> 00:31:10,918
fantastic. Excuse me. All right. Hook me

537
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:14,719
up with a little

538
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:16,960
one still. But it's still tasty.

539
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,159
Dude, that's exactly the one I wanted. I

540
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,600
thought you were going over there and

541
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:21,679
then you went right to the little ball

542
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:23,519
that I felt like I should be inhaling.

543
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:26,200
Did your name on it? It had my name on

544
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:28,519
it. Is that big enough for you? Oh,

545
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:33,480
yeah. Pass my

546
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:38,839
camera and just arms in. Oh,

547
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:38,839
man. Nice work, sir. Nice work.

548
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:53,879
Wow, dude. I know what you're saying. It

549
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:55,480
definitely changes.

550
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:59,480
Changes.

551
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:59,480
Wow. Wow.

552
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:12,640
So, second place avenue right there.

553
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,679
Yes.

554
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:19,640
Thank you so

555
00:32:14,679 --> 00:32:19,640
much. This is

556
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:38,440
[Applause]

557
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:40,960
Okay.

558
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:44,840
Awesome. He's like, "Okay, that

559
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,840
explains." Oh, thank you.

560
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:51,000
Well, that was really a nice experience

561
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:51,000
right there. Look at that.

562
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:57,600
Yep. I'm going to press uh press it

563
00:32:55,278 --> 00:32:59,519
again. Of course. Press it three more

564
00:32:57,599 --> 00:33:01,278
times. Yeah, I used the pipe. You could

565
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,880
press it in this three more times and

566
00:33:01,278 --> 00:33:05,839
collect all the rest. Yes, the pipe once

567
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:07,519
in. Uh, yes, please.

568
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:09,199
I'm just going to leave that one. So,

569
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:10,960
careful cuz it's on the ground. Oh,

570
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,319
yeah.

571
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:15,798
You want to do it up on the table so

572
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:15,798
everyone can see?

573
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:24,798
All

574
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:27,360
right. Pop the flower in here.

575
00:33:24,798 --> 00:33:30,558
All right. So, flowers in. This is uh

576
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:32,879
the soil grown rosin technique. Yes,

577
00:33:30,558 --> 00:33:38,839
soil grown 2015. Thanks, buddy. Thank

578
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:42,919
you. Soil grown. And then one, two,

579
00:33:38,839 --> 00:33:42,918
three. All right.

580
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:52,320
Dab. Dab. Right there. Rosin. Yes. All

581
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:54,000
right. I want a dab of that. Yeah. Yeah.

582
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:55,519
Here you go, buddy. Maybe clean that up.

583
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,759
Excuse me. I threw the butt on the hash.

584
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:59,519
No

585
00:33:56,759 --> 00:34:02,798
worries. See that? He melt the oil right

586
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:05,599
out of the bud. Doug, fresh. Fresh. No

587
00:34:02,798 --> 00:34:07,440
solvent.

588
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:09,118
Just give that a wipe with your fingers.

589
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,519
Yeah.

590
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:14,800
I don't, but we could rip a piece off if

591
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:16,559
you want. So, this is to show that it's

592
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,480
real bubble gum. It sticks to the

593
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:20,239
bottom. Nice. I like that you got your

594
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:24,000
medainer.

595
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:25,519
Yeah, John. Johnny B. Yeah, man. Then

596
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,440
you know it's bubblegum. You can stick

597
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:31,639
to the bottom. If you can put posters up

598
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,639
with it, then it's all good.

599
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,519
Yeah, brother.

600
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:43,519
Yeah. Revlon. He gets the good one. Jeff

601
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:45,440
Church doesn't [ __ ] around. It was

602
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:47,039
actually the cheap one. Can you imagine

603
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:49,599
one day where Jeff could be like a

604
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:54,519
Revlon model like holding one of these

605
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:54,519
up when I crimp my butt?

606
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:01,280
For press the isolator is good. This

607
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:03,920
Yeah, but we squeeze the hash. We

608
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:05,599
squeezed oil out of the sticky. Oh, it's

609
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:08,880
sticky. He's Watch how easy he picks it

610
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:11,039
up. No salt. No. It's like no. Yeah,

611
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:15,280
it's parchment. But you can also use the

612
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:19,559
teflon which is oil slick. Yeah, they

613
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:19,560
both work. This one works good too.

614
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:30,199
Crazy.

615
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:42,000
Yeah, you're just half perfect.

616
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:44,480
the fact that it was a bud in his jar

617
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:48,719
like 8 minutes ago. Now it's going to be

618
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:48,719
a dab in my lungs like 10 seconds

619
00:35:59,559 --> 00:36:06,440
later. The 25 years we've been doing

620
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,440
that. That's pretty [ __ ] nuts.

621
00:36:09,358 --> 00:36:14,409
Oh my god.

622
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,409
[Applause]

623
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:21,440
Like like living

624
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:23,838
hash. Living hash. Awesome.

625
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,838
Something

626
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:34,960
said scraping it off the thing and

627
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:37,760
collecting it as a clear oil.

628
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:39,679
There's more than that. Yeah. Very good.

629
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:42,560
If you learn the technique, the smaller

630
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:46,759
the bud, the more return. Okay. Too big

631
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:46,759
of a bud and then it gets caught.

632
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:51,838
You can still take this and smoke it.

633
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:53,920
Someone that or use it in an edible or

634
00:36:51,838 --> 00:36:57,039
coconut oil. There's still some

635
00:36:53,920 --> 00:37:00,039
medicine, but this is top quality

636
00:36:57,039 --> 00:37:00,039
medicine.

637
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,880
I know.

638
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:21,880
All right. Now you

639
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:21,880
got this.

640
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,320
We're going to

641
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:32,320
press on the screen.

642
00:37:33,239 --> 00:37:38,799
whatever

643
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:38,800
twist and you

644
00:37:39,079 --> 00:37:42,480
know I'm going to set

645
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:59,479
up so far

646
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:14,078
I'm going to give this one more. But

647
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:15,679
anyway, you know, you going for another

648
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:16,720
squish here. I just turned it off cuz

649
00:38:15,679 --> 00:38:19,919
I'm worried that you're going to heat it

650
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:21,679
up too hot. Careful cuz if it smokes the

651
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:24,720
thing it's there's too much power going

652
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:27,719
through it. That's all.

653
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:32,399
I just turned it back on too. a fast

654
00:38:27,719 --> 00:38:36,399
bubble. See how it goes.

655
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:39,200
Yeah, there's some more rosin. Yeah.

656
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:41,760
Probably 50% of what it just gave us.

657
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:41,759
It's not bad.

658
00:38:49,358 --> 00:38:52,358
Yes.

659
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:59,440
It's It's It's like

660
00:38:56,199 --> 00:39:02,239
a color.

661
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:04,880
Rosin.

662
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:07,759
Oh, what's this for? To rosin.

663
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:12,519
Okay, he'll do it. One second. Uh, he

664
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:12,520
wants you to try this, bud. Uh Jeff,

665
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:22,000
just a little bit. Okay.

666
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:25,039
Well, a little bit. No, not too much. Or

667
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,199
you open it and nothing's there. So,

668
00:39:25,039 --> 00:39:29,838
it's just a little bit. Press this one

669
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:32,159
next. Yeah. He just That's his press it

670
00:39:29,838 --> 00:39:36,159
up and give him a dab. Yeah, for sure.

671
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:38,799
Fresh dabs. Fresh dabs.

672
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:40,239
We're making hash. Oh, careful.

673
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,839
You want to be really solid with this

674
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:46,078
pipe. Never really hit it from a weird

675
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:47,599
angle. That's how the pipe will.

676
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:50,480
The first person that hit it today

677
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:53,200
dropped this on the table. I was so glad

678
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:56,320
it didn't break cuz that's all the It's

679
00:39:53,199 --> 00:40:01,000
the only piece I have. Nice. So, what we

680
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:01,000
got? Press it up. Perfect.

681
00:40:02,039 --> 00:40:06,119
Yeah. Yes.

682
00:40:07,519 --> 00:40:11,599
Give me that thing on the right there.

683
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:14,719
Yeah. Wait. Oh, here. I'll clean it.

684
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:16,880
Yes. My fingers are available. I can do

685
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:18,639
it, too. If you want to give yours cuz

686
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:21,119
you're operating the rosin and stuff.

687
00:40:18,639 --> 00:40:22,879
It's fine. Operating the You're a rosin

688
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,640
tech.

689
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,680
Rosin technician. Yeah. Terry will have

690
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:27,279
a machine that he's going to be

691
00:40:25,679 --> 00:40:29,598
building. He'll be like, "Wait, I got

692
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:31,280
I'm building a machine, mate." I'm like,

693
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:34,680
"Dude, like your water extraction

694
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:37,599
machine, dude. sell the [ __ ]

695
00:40:34,679 --> 00:40:38,960
bags. That's what I said to Terry. He

696
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:40,400
was supposed to be the guy to sell the

697
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:42,159
bags in the beginning and then instead

698
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:45,599
of selling the bags, he was like, I'm

699
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:50,000
going to build a machine.

700
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:52,640
Okay. Of course you never hire. Dude, at

701
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,039
this point in our life, we know that the

guy's butt that we just squeezed? Where

713
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:39,079
did he get a hit? Awesome. I should have

714
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:39,079
I should have done that.

715
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,760
Very nice. You make these in Italy?

716
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,519

I got to get back to the I had one right

00:43:43,039 --> 00:43:48,719

Beautiful. Thank you for coming by and

749
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:55,280
bringing the party. Started the party,

750
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,280
dude.

751
00:43:56,079 --> 00:44:00,119
started the party. Very nice.

752
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:16,560
All the great familiar faces. This is

753
00:44:13,039 --> 00:44:18,318
good times right now. I don't mind. I

754
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:19,920
don't mind.

755
00:44:18,318 --> 00:44:22,480
Careful with that. It's going to be like

756
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:25,519
nothing we've ever used. I think it'll

757
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:27,358
be runny. I think you should use this

758
00:44:25,519 --> 00:44:28,960
for that. Oh, it's going to be runny,

759
00:44:27,358 --> 00:44:30,719
bro. This is going to be the stuff that

760
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:33,599
makes someone pass out unconscious when

761
00:44:30,719 --> 00:44:37,118
they dab it. Trust me.

762
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:40,240
Second winner of a dude in Barcelona.

763
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:41,760
We're going to rosen it. Oh, wow.

764
00:44:40,239 --> 00:44:45,519
Imagine you take your entry and you

765
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:48,960
rosen it before you enter it. Jesus.

766
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:51,039
Whose fun was that one? That one was his

767
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:55,079
age. Yeah. Let's hit your nail. Yeah,

768
00:44:51,039 --> 00:44:55,079
you take that and I'll get him.

769
00:44:55,280 --> 00:45:02,119
I'm going to wait to do it video though.

770
00:44:58,119 --> 00:45:02,119
So, see

771
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:10,960
See how we have different text, Jeff?

772
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:12,239
Yeah. I like yours though.

773
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,920
The first time I tried to use it, I

774
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:16,078
ripped the paper like an idiot. That's

775
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:18,079
the best thing about hashish. Everybody

776
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:19,920
has a different tech because they did

777
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:22,560
it, you know, or they saw everybody do

778
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:24,880
it. But you know, like it's it's all

779
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:27,039
over. A lot of time it's just what you

780
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:30,838
had lying around.

781
00:45:27,039 --> 00:45:30,838
What can I do right now?

782
00:45:33,519 --> 00:45:41,079
Juliet. Oh my god. Look, it's [ __ ]

783
00:45:38,199 --> 00:45:44,719
through without without me

784
00:45:41,079 --> 00:45:47,440
even. Look at this.

785
00:45:44,719 --> 00:45:49,358
That is pre There we go. Pre

786
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:51,119
pre-pressed. There's already rust and

787
00:45:49,358 --> 00:45:55,199
greasing out. So, this is going to be

788
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:57,280
epic right here. Barbing. Okay. Barb,

789
00:45:55,199 --> 00:45:59,679
this is my first time. This is my first

790
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:01,280
time on the Teflon. We're making Be

791
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:02,799
careful with the heat on this one. It's

792
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:05,599
not going to be like bud. Let's Let's

793
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:07,119
go. Little shots. Let's Yeah. And you

794
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:08,559
you're welcome to use the smaller one if

795
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:10,318
you want. No, this is great. Just real

796
00:46:08,559 --> 00:46:12,199
little shots.

797
00:46:10,318 --> 00:46:15,358
Nice. This is going to be

798
00:46:12,199 --> 00:46:17,118
nuts. Don't smoke it too much.

799
00:46:15,358 --> 00:46:20,159
Oh, I can't wait for the money shot when

800
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:23,559
he opens this. Let's take a peek. Hold

801
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:23,559
on. One more.

802
00:46:24,719 --> 00:46:32,559
Wow. And there's a lot more to go. Oh,

803
00:46:28,559 --> 00:46:32,559
wow. Oh.

804
00:46:33,079 --> 00:46:38,480
Oh. Jesus.

805
00:46:35,838 --> 00:46:43,719
Jesus Christ. Set that there. We'll

806
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:43,719
We'll get a couple dabs. Take a shot.

807
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:49,200
Smells

808
00:46:46,838 --> 00:46:51,199
awesome. Look at that. It looks like

809
00:46:49,199 --> 00:46:55,519
like a marking a chef would put on a

810
00:46:51,199 --> 00:46:58,639
dessert with like the raspberry [ __ ]

811
00:46:55,519 --> 00:47:01,358
the mango one cake resin, right? And

812
00:46:58,639 --> 00:47:04,480
[ __ ] turn it into just So now Matt

813
00:47:01,358 --> 00:47:06,440
knows why he would take his six-star and

814
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:10,440
turn it to 10

815
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:10,440
star. Damn.

816
00:47:11,079 --> 00:47:16,240
Damn. I mean, I haven't hit it yet, but

817
00:47:13,519 --> 00:47:19,480
I have to admit like that this could

818
00:47:16,239 --> 00:47:23,118
[ __ ] someone up.

819
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:25,358
This [ __ ] someone up. Yeah.

820
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:30,318
Holy Christ.

821
00:47:25,358 --> 00:47:32,078
That's just like the Shiva snot. Wow.

822
00:47:30,318 --> 00:47:34,800
It's just so gummy. Yeah. Push it down

823
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:38,400
and and pick it up like snap. You know

824
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:40,318
what I mean? Like flat the way you were.

825
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:42,160
Yeah. And just tap it down like push it

826
00:47:40,318 --> 00:47:44,159
down and then lift it up.

827
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:48,039
Ah, here. Let me show you. Yeah, it

828
00:47:44,159 --> 00:47:48,039
doesn't seem as tight though.

829
00:47:48,239 --> 00:47:53,118
There he goes. Now he's got it. Oh, it's

830
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:54,719
really chirpy. Yeah, it's like insane.

831
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:58,440
Here, I'm just going to go for this

832
00:47:54,719 --> 00:47:58,439
little section here.

833
00:47:59,838 --> 00:48:02,400
That's a nice

834
00:48:05,079 --> 00:48:11,359
one. Hold this so I can do the camera.

835
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:11,359
So P. Thank you,

836
00:48:16,349 --> 00:48:20,118
[Music]

837
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:23,640
Jia.

838
00:48:20,119 --> 00:48:27,640
Ready. Take one. Barbs

839
00:48:23,639 --> 00:48:27,639
in. Barbs.

840
00:48:49,679 --> 00:48:55,000
We just made rosin out of bar full melt.

841
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:03,519
Talk about a good time to roll up,

842
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:05,520
Joseph. Woo!

843
00:49:03,519 --> 00:49:08,519
Dude, that that's strong as [ __ ] isn't

844
00:49:05,519 --> 00:49:08,519
it?

845
00:49:13,358 --> 00:49:17,519
It's different. Changed it. It changed.

846
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,920
Totally. You got rid of all the wax

847
00:49:17,519 --> 00:49:22,318
membranes. The carb usually lights up

848
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:24,079
the face. Sort of has changed it a

849
00:49:22,318 --> 00:49:25,480
little bit. I got to try this guy. Yeah,

850
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:27,640
of course,

851
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:30,639
dude. Changed

852
00:49:27,639 --> 00:49:30,639
it.

853
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:42,440
See this? This is

854
00:49:38,119 --> 00:49:42,440
Yeah. Still fantastic.

855
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:49,520
Excuse me. All right. Hook me up with a

856
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:52,318
little one.

857
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:54,639
Still, but it's still tasty.

858
00:49:52,318 --> 00:49:55,759
Dude, that's exactly the one I wanted. I

859
00:49:54,639 --> 00:49:57,279
thought you were going over there and

860
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:59,119
then you went right to the little ball

861
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:00,880
that I felt like I should be inhaling.

862
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:02,318
You need your name on it. It have my

863
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:04,880
name on it. Is that big enough for you?

864
00:50:02,318 --> 00:50:06,119
Oh yeah.

865
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:08,800
Pass my

866
00:50:06,119 --> 00:50:11,079
camera in

867
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:16,440
arms in. Oh

868
00:50:11,079 --> 00:50:16,440
man. Nice work, sir. Nice work.

869
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:33,079
Wow, dude. I know what you're saying. It

870
00:50:29,519 --> 00:50:36,079
definitely changes changes time.

871
00:50:33,079 --> 00:50:36,079
Wow.

872
00:50:44,358 --> 00:50:50,239
Wow. So, second place avenue right

873

Thank you so

875
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:56,240
much. This

876
00:51:10,519 --> 00:51:13,480
is

877
00:51:11,809 --> 00:51:16,558
[Applause]

878
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:18,639
okay. That is awesome.

879
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:21,640
It's like he's like, "Okay, that

880
00:51:18,639 --> 00:51:21,639
explains."

881
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:28,599
Well, that was really a nice experience

882
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:28,599
right there. Look at that.

883
00:51:30,239 --> 00:51:35,279
Yep. I'm going to press uh press it

884
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:37,358
again. Of course. Press it three more

885
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:39,280
times. I use the pipe. You can press it

886
00:51:37,358 --> 00:51:43,440
in this three more times and collect all

887
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:45,119
the rest. Yes, the pipe. Uh yes, please.

888
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:48,159
I'm just going to leave that one.

889
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:48,160
Careful cuz it's on the

890
00:51:54,440 --> 00:52:00,159
ground.

891
00:51:56,838 --> 00:52:00,159
Yeah. More

892
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:09,119
rosin. Barb's not done yet. Second

893
00:52:05,559 --> 00:52:12,880
press. Oh, I can see it. Yeah, there it

894
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:15,358
is. It's coming out hard there.

895
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:18,400
Okay. So, that's how I normally do it,

896
00:52:15,358 --> 00:52:20,880
but I do it 230°. That's hotter than

897
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:25,039
that. So, I did it like half the time. I

898
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:27,760
did 15 seconds just then. 15 seconds.

899
00:52:25,039 --> 00:52:31,000
Oh, yeah. Drip.

900
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:31,000
Oh, wow.

901
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:37,358
Yeah. So, I aim it. So, I I have I have

902
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:39,598
the part or the uh the screen on the

903
00:52:37,358 --> 00:52:41,759
butterfly and then I do do the crimp

904
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:44,559
straight on it like this with a slight

905
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:46,920
angle so that hopefully all of the oil

906
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:50,720
will drip down off the sides and not be

907
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:53,920
on the the heating element. You know, it

908
00:52:50,719 --> 00:52:58,318
like comes out it runs out so you can

909
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:58,318
get as much to say in there, you

910
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:04,079
know. There's probably Yeah, I'm going

911
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:08,559
to press it again for sure. It might or

912
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:11,519
whatever. Yeah. I mean, it's getting

913
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:14,240
uh I just go like this,

914
00:53:11,519 --> 00:53:14,239
then open it

915
00:53:15,719 --> 00:53:19,719
again. Just push the button twice and

916
00:53:18,239 --> 00:53:24,439
then close

917
00:53:19,719 --> 00:53:24,439

00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:57,119
huge one cuz he's working, but give him

982
00:57:53,199 --> 00:57:58,558
a little taste. Sure.

983
00:57:57,119 --> 00:58:00,318
You want to do it when he's done with

984
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:02,000
it? So you can pick the dab up for him.

985
00:58:00,318 --> 00:58:05,199
Yeah.

986
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:08,159
He's quality 45.

987
00:58:05,199 --> 00:58:10,399
Dude, it's like up to six star like I'm

988
00:58:08,159 --> 00:58:13,358
interested to see how it it changes for

989
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:16,079
you. What? It'll how it how it changes

990
00:58:13,358 --> 00:58:20,078
from smoking this from you smoking this.

991
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:20,079
Yeah. You smoking this. It

992
00:58:23,798 --> 00:58:30,960
changes normally. And I like more press.

993
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:34,000
It goes broken the tins and mix the oil

994
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:36,798
and everything.

995
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:40,318
Okay. But this is different. It's like

996
00:58:36,798 --> 00:58:42,639
uh it's awesomeness

997
00:58:40,318 --> 00:58:47,318
a little bit. I don't know. It's just

998
00:58:42,639 --> 00:58:47,318
down here. I'll grab you. Okay.

999
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:51,079
Small one.

1000
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:53,079
Like you get

1001
00:58:51,079 --> 00:58:58,440
me. Tell

1002
00:58:53,079 --> 00:58:58,440
me that. You know, you know,

1003
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:05,798
it's so Yeah, dude. Yeah. Poland snap

1004
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:05,798
shattered. Hey, I know.

1005
00:59:15,358 --> 00:59:20,759
maybe

1006
00:59:17,239 --> 00:59:23,598
dad. But the taste and cuz he knows the

1007
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:27,160
strain, you know, it's his per he smokes

1008
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:27,160
it a lot. He's

1009
00:59:27,838 --> 00:59:36,000
45 micron. Yeah. Amazing. Amazing. Which

1010
00:59:33,358 --> 00:59:39,199
one was that? That was That was his uh

1011
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:41,599
devil fruit. Devil fruit. Fresh frozen.

1012
00:59:39,199 --> 00:59:43,919
Yeah. Fortified half plant. It's nice

1013
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:46,798
quality, but I must try it out. Yeah.

1014
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:49,119
Yeah. Transform the the getting out of

1015
00:59:46,798 --> 00:59:51,000
control. Your [ __ ] parchment, dude.

1016
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:55,039
Jesus.

1017
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:57,039
Wow. It's amazing, dude. He can roll

1018
00:59:55,039 --> 00:59:59,199
that up in a second into a little patty

1019
00:59:57,039 --> 01:00:01,358
in the middle so it's all clean. I I

1020
00:59:59,199 --> 01:00:03,598
could do it as well, but I like the

1021
01:00:01,358 --> 01:00:07,440
film. I catch Jeff doing it. It looks

1022
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:10,440
better. It is a butterfly. It's not

1023
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:10,440
beautiful.

1024
01:00:12,318 --> 01:00:18,798
It's like a [ __ ] trophy.

1025
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:21,359
Wow. Yeah. And that's just 45. Let's uh

1026
01:00:18,798 --> 01:00:23,679
let's try the 73. So much smoother. Like

1027
01:00:21,358 --> 01:00:25,838
it cuts out that little bit of harshness

1028
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:27,519
that you get from any contaminant you

1029
01:00:25,838 --> 01:00:30,159
might have. That's devil fruit. Yours

1030
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:32,400
yours has very little. So, it's like,

1031
01:00:30,159 --> 01:00:35,519
but it's it it's like that waxy

1032
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:38,079
cellulose uh membrane that holds all the

1033
01:00:35,519 --> 01:00:41,960
resin in. That's what we're not getting

1034
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:41,960
with the rock. So nice.

1035
01:00:44,239 --> 01:00:48,798
So, today Yeah, I killed it with this.

1036
01:00:47,199 --> 01:00:51,199
Yeah, man. You're going to win contests

1037
01:00:48,798 --> 01:00:56,480
with this. You're so amazing. You'll

1038
01:00:51,199 --> 01:00:59,279
take like uh 20 46 90 micron.

1039
01:00:56,480 --> 01:01:02,519
People will be like afraid. Yeah, having

1040
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:02,519
heart attacks.

1041
01:01:08,798 --> 01:01:16,159
I imagine big pieces. You can make big

1042
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:18,159
pieces. Yeah, big nice. You can make

1043
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:19,759
them just a little bit at a time and

1044
01:01:18,159 --> 01:01:22,798
then

1045
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:27,839
the quality is on point.

1046
01:01:22,798 --> 01:01:32,280
Where can I go through these two?

1047
01:01:27,838 --> 01:01:32,279
Take the flat iron. Yeah.

1048
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:45,039
Wow, that's really

1049
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:45,039
tricky. We're working

1050
01:01:47,318 --> 01:01:52,119
on that's why I want to be able

1051
01:01:50,358 --> 01:01:55,759
to do

1052
01:01:52,119 --> 01:01:58,079
that right now.

1053
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:59,770
We're puffing right now. What a

1054
01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:07,480
coincidence.

1055
01:01:59,769 --> 01:02:11,480
[Applause]

1056
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:11,480
420 buddy.

1057
01:02:11,559 --> 01:02:18,720
Crazy hot heads. This

1058
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:20,159
guy's ridiculous. Yeah, that was uh Oh,

1059
01:02:18,719 --> 01:02:22,239
that was the bar. That was Barb. That's

1060
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:25,440
right. Smoking barb. That Yeah, that

1061
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:27,598
doesn't It's different. Hey,

1062
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:29,760
it's nice. Dude, this is fun and

1063
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:33,480
exciting. It's like I feel like I'm at

1064
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:33,480
the edge of the cutting.

1065
01:02:33,519 --> 01:02:39,318
Dude, how you I got him on tape going,

1066
01:02:35,599 --> 01:02:41,599
"What the fuck?"

1067
01:02:39,318 --> 01:02:42,880
Wait, listen. Listen. That dude right

1068
01:02:41,599 --> 01:02:45,280
there that you just showed how to make

1069
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:48,720
this, you'll win like a dozen contests

1070
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:50,480
in next year. Rosing his he wrote the

1071
01:02:48,719 --> 01:02:54,000
book.

1072
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:54,000
low extraction

1073
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:01,760
every start he'll start going crazy like

1074
01:03:00,239 --> 01:03:04,078
he's like yeah let's press out all these

1075
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:08,559
things and we we did one he's like oh my

1076
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:11,200
god oh my god it's dude another level

1077
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:14,960
stepping up I just am thinking of how

1078
01:03:11,199 --> 01:03:17,679
many contests Javier will win doing this

1079
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:20,880
in the next one year how many will you

1080
01:03:17,679 --> 01:03:23,440
win I don't know Maybe they the same as

1081
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:26,798
strength.

1082
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:29,039
Yeah. Yeah, man. Yeah, it really it

1083
01:03:26,798 --> 01:03:32,318
brings the flavor of each strain out so

1084
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:35,520
much more surprise because I made with

1085
01:03:32,318 --> 01:03:40,480
this strain is the frost fresh frozen.

1086
01:03:35,519 --> 01:03:40,480
It is amazing. But this is like our

1087
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:47,838
next test. I had tests done on the

1088
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:52,240
before the rosin and then the after and

1089
01:03:47,838 --> 01:03:55,440
the tarpine content went up from 6.4 mg

1090
01:03:52,239 --> 01:03:58,719
per gram to 7.4 mg per gram. It it

1091
01:03:55,440 --> 01:04:00,798
gained a more turppen after he made it

1092
01:03:58,719 --> 01:04:03,118
because he got rid of the wax membranes

1093
01:04:00,798 --> 01:04:05,358
the concentrates. Exactly. So, but it

1094
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:07,760
didn't even the heat did not destroy

1095
01:04:05,358 --> 01:04:10,480
everything and it was only slight there

1096
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:13,200
was only

1097
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:15,280
we're back at it. Haze by medical seats

1098
01:04:13,199 --> 01:04:17,519
that we can get into. So, this is the

1099
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:21,000
bud.

1100
01:04:17,519 --> 01:04:21,000
I love Haze.

1101
01:04:21,199 --> 01:04:26,558
So, just a little tiny bit like you

1102
01:04:23,599 --> 01:04:28,798
expect with Haze. Yep. Just got those

1103
01:04:26,559 --> 01:04:31,680
small resin heads. Let me gather that

1104
01:04:28,798 --> 01:04:34,159
dab up for you.

1105
01:04:31,679 --> 01:04:36,960
to gather up two dabs cuz I want to

1106
01:04:34,159 --> 01:04:40,719
taste them.

1107
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:43,358
Deep Neville deep. That's the deep. I

1108
01:04:40,719 --> 01:04:46,798
think I want to try the next one. Yeah,

1109
01:04:43,358 --> 01:04:49,358
that's the one. That's the one.

1110
01:04:46,798 --> 01:04:51,199
Yeah, he's totally like Yeah, cuz he had

1111
01:04:49,358 --> 01:04:53,679
no understanding of what was going on.

1112
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:56,558
Parchment paper. No, I mean I understand

1113
01:04:53,679 --> 01:04:59,118
PHO. This is just not You have low grade

1114
01:04:56,559 --> 01:05:01,039
hash. Low grade hash you put in here and

1115
01:04:59,119 --> 01:05:03,200
you ball it up into it. You know, you

1116
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:05,240
put it in here and you you twist this up

1117
01:05:03,199 --> 01:05:08,078
and ball it up and crimp that in the

1118
01:05:05,239 --> 01:05:12,000
silicone and it squirts hash oil out.

1119
01:05:08,079 --> 01:05:14,318
Yeah. Like little chips.

1120
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:17,079
Little chips. Yeah. It's not a weed

1121
01:05:14,318 --> 01:05:19,759
chip. You can actually eat it. No

1122
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:23,280
[ __ ] easy. Enjoy. That's not really

1123
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:26,000
enough for a nice one. No. Yeah. Well,

1124
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:27,599
it it varies. It's a dab, though, right?

1125
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:30,838
There's only one little bite. That's all

1126
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:34,798
that is there. That's all that's there.

1127
01:05:30,838 --> 01:05:36,719
Why use this? This is a pizza box. Do

1128
01:05:34,798 --> 01:05:40,000
you know what I mean? Like when I order

1129
01:05:36,719 --> 01:05:42,239
a pizza, I don't eat the box. I take the

1130
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:44,239
pizza out. Sometimes I dough is not much

1131
01:05:42,239 --> 01:05:46,959
better either, right? If you go to a

1132
01:05:44,239 --> 01:05:51,118
shitty pizza spot, I would never do

1133
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:52,039
that. I'm all 90 micron pizza.

1134
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:55,519
Just a

1135
01:05:52,039 --> 01:05:55,520
second. See if my

1136
01:05:59,639 --> 01:06:03,639
game technology.

1137
01:06:09,358 --> 01:06:15,759
So, I got barely a little bit more right

1138
01:06:12,559 --> 01:06:19,240
there. Yeah. Awesome.

1139
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:19,240
I got this.

1140
01:06:39,358 --> 01:06:45,239
Yeah, buddy. Two thumbs up. Two thumbs

1141
01:06:42,079 --> 01:06:49,880
up for two tears down.

1142
01:06:45,239 --> 01:06:49,879
Yeah, I like the shirt.

1143
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:56,559
Very good. Yeah. What was that? Turn

1144
01:06:53,920 --> 01:07:00,480
turn the best [ __ ] into better [ __ ]

1145
01:06:56,559 --> 01:07:04,920
That's impossible. Uh, well, we'll see.

1146
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:04,920
Second place. Nons.

1147
01:07:08,318 --> 01:07:12,480
The sin of the look on people's faces as

1148
01:07:11,119 --> 01:07:15,039
we've been doing this throughout the day

1149
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:17,440
has just been like So, wait a second.

1150
01:07:15,039 --> 01:07:20,160
What are you doing?

1151
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:23,440
Oh, it's Look at it coming out.

1152
01:07:20,159 --> 01:07:27,519
You get the dripping. Totally.

1153
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:29,200
Thing is, how ridiculous. And Oh, dude.

1154
01:07:27,519 --> 01:07:31,440
Look at that.

1155
01:07:29,199 --> 01:07:33,118
Hey, Al, you seen this? Squeezing oil at

1156
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:36,000
a hatch. It's beautiful, dude. It's

1157
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:39,920
nuts. And that's barb. We got to hit

1158
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:42,719
that. I can smell crazy a little harder

1159
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:44,480
than I was eating,

1160
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:46,480
but he had his tested and the fact that

1161
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:49,280
that karaopoly was present shows that

1162
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:52,199
the heat can't be destroying too much

1163
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:57,920
raw uh

1164
01:07:52,199 --> 01:08:00,239
uh his tested and it was 70% THC non

1165
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:03,599
decarboxilated decarboxilation doesn't

1166
01:08:00,239 --> 01:08:05,679
happen in in in 2 seconds with 200°

1167
01:08:03,599 --> 01:08:07,200
temperature. You need like the extreme

1168
01:08:05,679 --> 01:08:09,759
temperature of a flame or a nail to

1169
01:08:07,199 --> 01:08:14,919
decaroxulate immediately.

1170
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:14,920
It's right here. Dude, look at that.

1171
01:08:16,158 --> 01:08:19,639
Yeah. Yeah, exactly.

1172
01:08:20,399 --> 01:08:27,639
Dude, that's really sick.

1173
01:08:24,449 --> 01:08:27,639
[Applause]

1174
01:08:31,039 --> 01:08:37,198
It's ridiculous. Now, now Don, Don, go

1175
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:39,520
back to high school for a second and

1176
01:08:37,198 --> 01:08:42,238
just think all of these kids with access

1177
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:46,359
to dabs that never had access. They just

1178
01:08:42,238 --> 01:08:46,358
had shitty weed they could get.

1179
01:08:46,399 --> 01:08:50,838
I know. My sister had a hair

1180
01:08:47,838 --> 01:08:50,838
straightener.

1181
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:57,920
Rosin with a great gardener. Trying it

1182
01:08:56,238 --> 01:09:00,798
for my first time making rosin. Aaron

1183
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:02,640
from DNA. Don't burn your finger. Don't

1184
01:09:00,798 --> 01:09:04,319
burn your finger.

1185
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:06,159
Push down with your fingers. Real look.

1186
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:08,080
Push down with your fingers and then

1187
01:09:06,158 --> 01:09:10,399
only for a few seconds and then open it

1188
01:09:08,079 --> 01:09:12,399
up and kind of do it again. Make sure it

1189
01:09:10,399 --> 01:09:14,479
as you see it's leaking out. That's when

1190
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:16,639
you kind of Yeah, cuz that's hot as

1191
01:09:14,479 --> 01:09:19,759
[ __ ] I'd open it again. You don't want

1192
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:22,159
to burn it. Open it. Open it. Open it.

1193
01:09:19,759 --> 01:09:26,000
Now open that thing and show us. [ __ ]

1194
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:29,519
put it. Look at that [ __ ]

1195
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:31,520
Oh yeah. Open that up now. Bro, you can

1196
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:33,239
just drop the pressing screen. Oh, look

1197
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:38,279
at that dude

1198
01:09:33,238 --> 01:09:41,198
out just starting running down. Jesus

1199
01:09:38,279 --> 01:09:43,120
nerid from the Jamaican bud. No, that

1200
01:09:41,198 --> 01:09:46,079
was from some rosin that like some of

1201
01:09:43,119 --> 01:09:48,640
his nice hat from the bar. You just buy

1202
01:09:46,079 --> 01:09:51,039
garbage. You just buy garbage hash and

1203
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:53,520
you squeeze that on camera. Buy garbage

1204
01:09:51,039 --> 01:09:55,279
hat and you just squeeze this [ __ ] up

1205
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:57,840
and then you're like good. Just like you

1206
01:09:55,279 --> 01:09:59,519
can buy 200 lb of any weed and turn it

1207
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:01,920
into that clear [ __ ] and put some

1208
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:04,719
[ __ ] turans in it and call it 99

1209
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:06,800
different strain names. This [ __ ] This

1210
01:10:04,719 --> 01:10:08,560
shit's pretty cool, man. I [ __ ] I got

1211
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:12,480
to give it up, man. It's definitely

1212
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:14,239
cool. That is [ __ ] insane. Barbs in

1213
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:16,479
dripage. So, can you imagine the

1214
01:10:14,238 --> 01:10:18,879
barbell? Wherever you go now, you just

1215
01:10:16,479 --> 01:10:22,158
bring your [ __ ] little iron now. I

1216
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:26,279
do. And you turn the trash into [ __ ]

1217
01:10:22,158 --> 01:10:28,719
stash. Yeah. three star to six-star in 5

1218
01:10:26,279 --> 01:10:30,639
seconds. Cuz when you travel, you can't

1219
01:10:28,719 --> 01:10:33,198
always have the kind pie. And that's why

1220
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:34,880
we're, you know, struggling sometimes in

1221
01:10:33,198 --> 01:10:36,559
different places in the world, but you

1222
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:38,960
can take any of the local flavors and

1223
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:41,920
just get like get 10 buds given to you

1224
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:45,039
and go home and have 10 dabs.

1225
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:47,600
That's nuts, bro. You don't have butane,

1226
01:10:45,039 --> 01:10:49,760
which is also it's safer. Like young

1227
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:51,760
kids are pretty stupid. They can blow

1228
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:53,679
up. They can make mistakes. I make

1229
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:57,039
mistakes at 42. I wouldn't [ __ ] around

1230
01:10:53,679 --> 01:10:58,560
with it. But at 20, I for sure. I'm

1231
01:10:57,039 --> 01:11:00,719
going to tell you the secret machine to

1232
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:02,880
use to make this [ __ ] Okay. Yeah. The

1233
01:11:00,719 --> 01:11:04,880
secrets. It's been out for a long time.

1234
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:07,679
The secrets. It's called the George

1235
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:11,039
Foreman. Oh, the George Foreman

1236
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:13,359
rosinator. George Foreman. You put

1237
01:11:11,039 --> 01:11:16,158
George Foreman will work because it's on

1238
01:11:13,359 --> 01:11:18,639
an angle. It makes it so the fat drips

1239
01:11:16,158 --> 01:11:20,559
and roots. You just keep rosining your

1240
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:23,119
[ __ ] and it drip down into the tray. We

1241
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:26,480
just need to get dail to create a George

1242
01:11:23,119 --> 01:11:28,719
Foreman a silicon carbide heated tray.

1243
01:11:26,479 --> 01:11:31,279
So that is the best heat source. It

1244
01:11:28,719 --> 01:11:33,760
really like we have a giant [ __ ]

1245
01:11:31,279 --> 01:11:36,000
t-shirt press at the warehouse connected

1246
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:38,159
to a [ __ ] trip. I'm thinking that has

1247
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:40,800
top and bottom work. Yes, that works

1248
01:11:38,158 --> 01:11:42,479
100%. Bro, you can giant [ __ ] slabs

1249
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:43,920
with that thing. What you got to do is

1250
01:11:42,479 --> 01:11:46,319
you got to put parchment paper on the

1251
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:48,399
bottom and then put buds like 2 or 3 in

1252
01:11:46,319 --> 01:11:50,238
apart. Just popcorn buds. You can put

1253
01:11:48,399 --> 01:11:52,000
like you don't even need these. You just

1254
01:11:50,238 --> 01:11:54,000
put more parchment on top. Give it a two

1255
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:55,760
second press. Open it up. Flick the buds

1256
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:57,198
off. And you've just got you collect the

1257
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:59,520
oil. Bro, I'm going to do that in

1258
01:11:57,198 --> 01:12:02,879
[ __ ]

1259
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:05,280
make a video. It's like new [ __ ]

1260
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:08,560
[ __ ] keep I had Yeah, you can rosin

1261
01:12:05,279 --> 01:12:11,279
all that, bro. Or static some of it. Or

1262
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:12,480
so much easier than all the other or all

1263
01:12:11,279 --> 01:12:14,158
of the above. Who's the one claiming

1264
01:12:12,479 --> 01:12:16,319
this? Who's the kid that discovered this

1265
01:12:14,158 --> 01:12:19,519
and started? Soil grown really blew it

1266
01:12:16,319 --> 01:12:21,119
up by pressing a button and getting oil

1267
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:23,080
out cuz it's simple as [ __ ] but it took

1268
01:12:21,119 --> 01:12:25,760
some intelligence to

1269
01:12:23,079 --> 01:12:27,760
actually no it's and it's timing. It's

1270
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:31,560
all just social media and the ability to

1271
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:31,560
share room.

1272
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:37,360
Wow. You turned great in super. I think

1273
01:12:35,279 --> 01:12:38,880
you can still make more. You can we'll

1274
01:12:37,359 --> 01:12:41,198
be able to squeeze that two three more

1275
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:44,640
times. Bro, there's a lot of Yeah, that

1276
01:12:41,198 --> 01:12:46,719
would be a regular. You can't leave that

1277
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:48,960
on either or it'll blow. But you can

1278
01:12:46,719 --> 01:12:51,439
squeeze it one more time, but squeeze it

1279
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:53,119
way less now cuz it's hotter. So, really

1280
01:12:51,439 --> 01:12:56,399
give it like a one or two second or you

1281
01:12:53,119 --> 01:12:57,760
might you might burn it. Take two.

1282
01:12:56,399 --> 01:13:00,759
And the pressure helps with your

1283
01:12:57,760 --> 01:13:00,760
fingers.

1284
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:06,199
Smoking a bit.

1285
01:13:07,039 --> 01:13:10,640
Look at it. Look at you. Got to figure

1286
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:12,960
out how to get all that out cuz there is

1287
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:14,560
a ton in there still. It's going to get

1288
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:16,119
refined. The method will get better and

1289
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:18,800
better. You

1290
01:13:16,119 --> 01:13:22,158
know, kids alcohol kids that are out

1291
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:24,400
there now going to figure out how to get

1292
01:13:22,158 --> 01:13:27,599
all of that out.

1293
01:13:24,399 --> 01:13:29,119
Yep. I'll be busy growing. You guys

1294
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:31,120
figure it out. I think it's time for

1301
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:57,640

1304
01:14:00,198 --> 01:14:06,079
uh soil grown that [ __ ] down.

1305
01:14:04,399 --> 01:14:08,399
Jeff just got back, so I figured, well,

1306
01:14:06,079 --> 01:14:12,479
we better film more rosin making cuz

1307
01:14:08,399 --> 01:14:12,479
we've only filmed like 48 minutes of it

1308
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:26,960
today. See what

1309
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:29,040
happen there. Little bit of distort on

1310
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:31,279
the butt. E, I'm going to repress with

1311
01:14:29,039 --> 01:14:33,519
for sure it'll come off.

1312
01:14:31,279 --> 01:14:35,359
I've been doing like three presses. I've

1313
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:39,800
seen that a little bit where it's just

1314
01:14:35,359 --> 01:14:39,799
the placement of the bud or whatever.

1315
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:48,560
Crazy. So, this one's so fresh it's

1316
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:49,759
spitting out green. That's neat. That's

1317
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:51,280
That's bizarre. I've never seen that

1318
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:56,719
before. I've never seen I've seen

1319
01:14:51,279 --> 01:14:56,719
purple. I've never seen like it's like

1320
01:14:59,319 --> 01:15:06,319
green cuz of the moisture in the bud

1321
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:06,320
brought some uh chlorophyll

1322
01:15:10,119 --> 01:15:17,158
out. You should see that green oil. Pull

1323
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:17,159
that up in the light.

1324
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:26,600
Little bit of fresh bud. Well, let's dab

1325
01:15:23,359 --> 01:15:26,599
