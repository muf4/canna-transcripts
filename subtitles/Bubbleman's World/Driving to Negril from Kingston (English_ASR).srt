55
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:48,039
to come check out when you're in Jamaica

56
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,719
uh in Montego Bay and uh yeah we won't

57
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:51,199
be driving well we'll be driving through

58
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:53,280
Montego Bay but we probably won't be

59
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:55,839
stopping cuz I really want to get to neg

60
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:59,959
grill uh you know as early as possible

61
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:02,640
it's already almost 1:00 with a 4H hour

62
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:05,120
Drive we're looking at uh 5:00 and

63
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:07,359
sunsets at 600 so we we right now this

64
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,759
minute we have about an hour buffer

65
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,000
before we miss the sunset it's probably

66
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:13,679
pretty likely that we're going to miss

67
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,080
the sunset maybe we might catch it

68
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,840
that's okay did you want to hit a d here

69

73
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:28,640
in the truck and uh head to Negril by

74
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:31,639
the way it's been over 10 years since

75
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:34,399
I've been in Negril just over 10 years

76
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:37,919
last time I was there may have been with

77
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,920
with skunkman Sam and Rob

78
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,120
Clark so this is a real sort of return

79
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:49,319
to one of my favorite zones I know Ryan

80
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:52,200
was telling me that it's changed quite a

81
00:03:49,318 --> 00:03:53,719
bit but uh I have to admit I never hung

82
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:56,518
out on the beach too much I was more of

83
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:58,158

84
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:00,519
cliffs and stuff

85
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:02,479

00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:47,680
the whole three and 1 half hour drive

133
00:05:46,038 --> 00:05:50,240
but uh thanks for joining us on our

134
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,240
adventure

135
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:55,519
guys so this is a m main road that takes

136
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:58,478
us to the highway yeah this is

137
00:05:55,519 --> 00:06:00,879
Washington Boulevard

138
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:03,719
okay seems like traffic's moving a lot

139
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:07,038
faster the boulevards I guess are

140
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:10,000
bigger yeah this is a fairly new road

141
00:06:07,038 --> 00:06:10,000
more outside of the

142
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,598
city so just heading up to the toll road

143
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,199
here this will be the first of two toll

144
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:33,240
highways that will take to get to N

145
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,319
Grill this one is the one to moay

146
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:38,160
correct y so it goes through Ochi and

147
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:41,759
then moay or does it skip Ochi it goes

148
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,080
through mon in the Hills all right sweet

149
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,560
well that'll be some nice footage for

150
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:47,399
people to see obviously this is pretty

151
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:50,199
sweet you got cane fields on the right

152
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:52,959
here and on the left and so you've heard

153
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:55,720
the songs if you continue to burn down

154
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:58,120
the wheat we're going to burn down your

155
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,199
cane Fields well those are the fields

156
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,519
right there and they're worth a lot of

157
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,919
money cuz they produce cane

158
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:06,799
sugar they make rum and all sorts of

159
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:09,719
other things out of it so it's uh it's

160
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,520
definitely a value here in Jamaica and

161
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,240
it's one way that ganja Farmers many

162
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:14,719
years ago anyway sort of used to fight

163
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,879
back a little bit if their fields were

164

piece of the action that you guys can

222
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:59,480
get when you come do bubble man's tours

223
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,919
you know we're trying to set this up

224
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:03,320
we're probably going to start it up as a

225
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:05,078
first time sort of a rather than have it

226
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,640
be an open tour company we're going to

227
00:10:05,078 --> 00:10:09,359
start it as like an initial event so

228
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:11,439
we're not sure exactly when but there'll

229
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,919
be a time in the first one I'm going to

230

234
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:24,480
that we portray in bubble man's world

235
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,120
what I like to call the real Jamaica you

236
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,240
know when you're able to remove yourself

237
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:30,759
from all-inclusive hotels and you're

238
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,839
able to get more into accessing the

239
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:35,838
people rather than employees that are

240
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:37,680
working at at at at nice hotels you have

241
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,000
a much better experience you know you

242
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:41,519
get to eat local food get to hang out

243
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,639
with local people have good

244
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,200
conversations learn things about the

245
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:47,600
island for people who have been living

246
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,519
here their whole life and then uh access

247
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,040
different parts of the culture from the

248
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:56,159
Rastafarian beliefs the sex from naab

249
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:58,799
bingi to uh 12 tribe to Bobo Shanti

250
00:10:56,159 --> 00:11:00,719
these are all different um I call I

251
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:01,958
think of them almost as like wise men

252
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,320
you know they all have different

253
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:06,319
information from their scriptures and

254
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,920
their belief systems and they've you

255
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,399
know it's come out of hundreds of years

256
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:12,319
of slavery with a little bit of

257
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,480
Christianity mixed in there and then the

258
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,800
rest of farian ism through the prophecy

259
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,278
of uh Marcus Garvey and the music of

260
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:20,479
Paul Marley and of course the crowning

261
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:23,120
of the black king of Ethiopia Emperor

262
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,000
Haley Cassi so these are all just pretty

263
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,560
cool things that you can learn about

264
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,480
better than learning from it on Google

265
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:31,679
in my opinion and look at where we are

266
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,278
look at the VI where you just can't

267
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:36,359
really beat the experience if you like

268
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:38,720
reggae music you want to come to Jamaica

269
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:41,240
and hit that Reg music trust

270
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:44,000
me listening to it here is so much

271
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,000
better than anywhere

272
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:51,399
else

273
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:53,319
keep then to the right yeah around the W

274
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:57,720

00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:07,479
the road yeah that is

279
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:13,799
cops and what do they do just pull over

280
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:15,679
everyone you know they're not really

281
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:17,559
supposed to be there because I don't

282
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:20,159
think the government even owns this

283
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:21,198
road China owns this road I think so

284
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:24,039
yeah

285
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:26,439
Jesus that's insane so those cops are

286
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:27,319
out there they're they on China's road

287
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,079

yeah right lane is a fast lane right I

291
00:12:35,198 --> 00:12:39,519

292
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:42,519
going about 150 km an hour flashing his

293
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:44,919

00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:44,919
enough for

295
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:51,278

get to that Caribbean Sea on the west

336
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:07,240

338
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,799

344
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:29,000
a little bit hard cuz the well the

345

road's a little bit rough and Ryan's

346
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,799
having a hell of a time holding that

347
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,799
camera solid so good effort though

348
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:40,278
Ryan another

349
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:48,560

355
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,000
so we're just going to go grab a few

356
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,330
patties real quick here so where should

357
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,408
I pull over behind this guy or

358
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:07,408
[Music]

359
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:15,759
[Music]

360
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:15,759
[Applause]

361
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:24,360
something first food of the day juicy

362
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:27,000
Patty

363
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:29,159
soya not too shabby I got to say I also

364
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,839
like the uh the vegetable ones with

365
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:33,519
caloo but they didn't have any of those

366
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:36,199
so we've got our our little they're kind

367
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:39,078
of like a samosa the little flattened

368
00:16:36,198 --> 00:16:40,838
Patty I often wonder if it had anything

369
00:16:39,078 --> 00:16:42,318
to do with indentured slaves that came

370
00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:44,000
here on their own recognizance from

371
00:16:42,318 --> 00:16:46,278
India back in the day they might have

372
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:50,839
brought the

373
00:16:46,278 --> 00:16:53,639
Samosa maybe over time we got flattened

374
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:55,440
down

375
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:57,480
anyway definitely worth checking out

376
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:00,480
when you're in

377
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,480
Jamaica

378
00:17:01,278 --> 00:17:07,078
well it has

379
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:09,720
been 3 hours 3 hours since we've been on

380
00:17:07,078 --> 00:17:11,480
our road here and it's been a relatively

381
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:14,199
beautiful drive I mean you can see

382
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:16,759
Jamaica is an utter and complete

383
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:20,360
Paradise so much fauna growing

384
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:23,318
everywhere just exotic flowers and trees

385
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:25,198
and shrubberies it's just obviously a

386
00:17:23,318 --> 00:17:26,759
pleasure to to drive through the country

387
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,679
we were getting a little bit of a bonus

388
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:30,599
in the sense that the sun's coming out

389
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:33,480
now but we've had a little bit of over

390
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:36,279
overcast clouds and that's been good for

391
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:39,919
us we like that that uh keeps it cool in

392
00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:40,918
the car without the AC on so give thanks

393
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,240
for

394
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:44,120
that oh yeah look at that guy's flying

395
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:47,000
on the

396
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:50,798
kite we must be getting close to Mo

397
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:55,119
Bay yeah this is um pre Mo Bay trani

398
00:17:50,798 --> 00:17:55,119
we're in ah trani I'm almost in

399
00:17:55,359 --> 00:18:00,439
F hey guys back again we're just and mo

400
00:17:58,759 --> 00:18:01,798
Bay waiting for Ryan to go get his

401
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:03,360
toothbrush and a few things that he

402
00:18:01,798 --> 00:18:07,279
wanted to bring with

403
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:09,479
him and uh yeah we haven't had any dabs

404
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:13,079
yet I just realized that we should be

405
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:15,480
dabbing so I realized every car has a

406
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:17,960
lighter for cigarettes I don't smoke

407
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,519
cigarettes but I can dab a little dabble

408
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:22,200
on top of the lighter when it pops out

409
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:24,839
and I can certainly take a ghetto style

410
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:26,798
hoot and that's what I'm going to do so

411
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:29,399
here in MO Bay we're actually at the

412
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:31,158
mint Retreat just out side of Maurice

413
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,600
Ellis's mother's place or at least she

414
00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:33,840
works here I'm not sure if she owns the

415
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:35,038
place or if she works here but I know

416
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:37,720
she's a part of it in some way or

417
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:39,679
another so that's pretty cool guess we

418
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:42,159
might have to turn this car on to

419
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:44,120
actually get this lighter to

420
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:45,440
work and I guess there's always the

421
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:48,038
potential chance that the lighter

422
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:50,919
doesn't work as well in which case then

423
00:18:48,038 --> 00:18:53,679
I will not be using this particular

424
00:18:50,919 --> 00:18:54,960
Dabber we'll see fingers crossed

425
00:18:53,679 --> 00:19:00,320
otherwise in 1 hour we're going to do

426
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:00,319
some nice smoking oh it's hot this is on

427
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,240
voice

428
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:46,639
anyway

429
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:48,759
delicious we'll uh catch up with the day

430
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:51,480

431
00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:54,279

anymore

436
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:02,640
and we've heard rumors we've heard

437
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,679
rumors that the police might be shutting

438
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,840
this event down but uh well you know

439
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:09,280
what rumors are rumors we don't need to

440
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:10,798
put much energy into them let's just

441
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:13,079
hope that this event is going to go off

00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:09,759
blessed to be back in the grill we're

495
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,558
not quite in the grill yet this is just

496
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:13,119
the sign leading us to the grill I'll

497
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:15,399
let you guys know when we get we're

498
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:17,278
going to go down a nice long road

499
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,720
that'll be very empty on either side

500
00:23:17,278 --> 00:23:20,079
with just Beach on the right and then

501
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,679
we'll get into the hotels at the

502
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:24,439
beginning of the 7 milei Beach and uh

503
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:26,759
well we'll see if we can't find Beach

504
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:29,159
comr strange for me to be staying on a

505
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:31,079
touristy Beach but but uh our place on

506
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:32,360
the cliffs fell through and we really

507
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:34,519
wanted to get a place that was big

508
00:23:32,359 --> 00:23:35,719
enough that we could entertain uh the

509
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:37,679
Cannabis Growers that were going to be

510
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:40,240
meeting at the stepping High Festival so

511
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,759
I guess uh that's basically why we did

512
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,720
that so otherwise we would have been on

513
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:46,359
the cliffs but uh still pretty excited

514
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:49,319
to wake up tomorrow and walk into the

515
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:52,918
water on the 7 Mile Beach where I was

516
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:55,720
married in 1995 20 years ago today well

517
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:58,278

520
00:24:00,558 --> 00:24:05,678

structures uh sandals and uh all those

sort of all-inclusive places that I

528
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:22,679
consider Nightmares From Hell but

529
00:24:20,519 --> 00:24:24,558
they're there and we're going to go buy

530

Winnipeg one of my great friends we we

562

throughout our life we've been separated

567
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,480
from one another for the last 10 to 15

568

years we've only seen each other a few

569
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,399
times but every time we see each other

570
00:26:10,278 --> 00:26:14,599

571
00:26:12,398 --> 00:26:16,158

buddy Kelly Castle who I haven't seen in

612
00:27:58,359 --> 00:28:03,359
a long time most people are just not

613
00:28:00,558 --> 00:28:03,359
going to know what this

614
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:06,959
is

615
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:10,080
actually look what we got for

616
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:13,278
temperature 82 I forgot to turn it on so

617
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:15,720
we'll do two things we drop that dab

618
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:18,000
flip this switch put that back on

619
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:20,960
there and then merly wait for this

620
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,839
number to get up to about

621
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,840
700° one of the things that I really

622
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:27,678
love about the denail is how easy and

623
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:30,359
quick that it heats up I often forget I

624
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:32,278
drop a dab in it's easy to drop it out

625
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:33,678
as it's sitting right there and then

626
00:28:32,278 --> 00:28:36,679
just to turn the thing on it's already

627
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:38,840
at 150 so we might not even get up to

628
00:28:36,679 --> 00:28:40,320
temperature before Kelly and his girl

629
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:42,798
come through the door so I'm pretty

630
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:44,079
excited to have them actually good good

631
00:28:42,798 --> 00:28:46,359
old friends that I haven't seen in a

632
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:48,278
long time you know

633
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:50,519
yeah feels pretty good to be in the

634
00:28:48,278 --> 00:28:52,480
grill I got to say after 10 years it's

635
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:54,759
different because I I kind of despised

636
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,759
the beach not really into the touristy

637
00:28:54,759 --> 00:28:58,679
aspect of it I've always really liked

638
00:28:56,759 --> 00:29:00,158
the clips

639
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:02,159
I'll tell you I do look forward to

640
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:03,880
waking up in the morning walking

641
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:06,399
straight out here and being on the

642
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:08,399
tropical Seven Mile white sand beach of

643
00:29:06,398 --> 00:29:10,759
Jamaica pretty

644
00:29:08,398 --> 00:29:12,518
sweet the sounds of the sadas and the

645
00:29:10,759 --> 00:29:14,359
Crickets in the background we got

646
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:16,759

651
00:29:22,398 --> 00:29:25,918

trip if you guys live in it's the one

734

really big bonus of living in the

735
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:09,439
Prairies and living out east they make

736
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:11,200
it that way every year how many New

737
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:15,320
Yorkers come here a lot because they

738
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:18,278
make the ticket so cheap 300 us bucks

739
00:33:15,319 --> 00:33:20,839

flights that way right yeah that's

747
00:33:37,558 --> 00:33:42,200
exactly why not enough people want to

00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:43,480
get out of Vancouver can afford to get

749
