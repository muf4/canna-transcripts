concentrate whatever the same [ __ ] no no

215
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:05,039
not the same [ __ ] I've really found Apex

216
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,278
and Trippy Stick to stand Apex gives the

217
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:10,000
best ahead of the game what I found was

218
00:09:08,278 --> 00:09:12,078
that I love Trippy Stick and I took it

219
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
everywhere and I used it everywhere and

220
00:09:12,078 --> 00:09:16,159
then I got the Apex and I was like the

221
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,679
Apex was like I don't even really

222
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:20,240
compare it to the Trippy Stick it's like

223
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:21,679
a different level it's closer to this

224
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,639
this is what I'm going need to put in my

225
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:25,278
Trippy Stick this is the ultimate boom

226
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:27,039
boom boom if you can just hit a small

227
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:29,759
rig if you can get something that's the

228
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:32,838
ultimate next an apex pen cuz the rips

229
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:35,078
it gives are insane then for like when

230
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:37,880
I'm up on a glacier or a mountain or on

231
00:09:35,078 --> 00:09:40,679
a boat or wherever my trippy sticks are

232
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:42,559

236
00:09:46,078 --> 00:09:50,799

238

244
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,079
different pants I've had the atmos P

245
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,320
this

246
00:10:08,078 --> 00:10:13,479
one the CBD you know the taste on that

247
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:15,360
it's just really for Taste oh dude cuz

248
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:17,879
it's certainly not going to like here's

249
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,360
a really nice idea for a session you hit

250
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:22,799
the Congo it's just

251
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:25,720
destructive it's very potent it'll throw

252
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:27,359
people off their game in fact uh great

253
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,800
high but like Aaron said it's pretty

254
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,519
much most people are done they don't

255
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:34,439
need to smoke like 10 more rips of the

256
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:37,399
Congo sure you could just don't need to

257
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:39,079
this one is more like this incredible

258
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:42,480
flavor and taste that is like the

259
00:10:39,078 --> 00:10:44,799
dessert MH yeah and it's not like the

260
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,480
there's no real Hammer no you know what

261
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:48,639
I'm saying you're high but there's not a

262
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,639
hammer definitely not which is strange

263
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:53,839
cuz it must be the canonic influence

264
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:57,278
because the Renee also much like the

265
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:59,760
Congo Had A Hammer massive Hammer had a

266
00:10:57,278 --> 00:11:01,278
ceiling this High yeah meaning that it

267
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:03,958
just would take you up and and I'm

268
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:05,958

290
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:53,519
little intro to Whistler you saw the

291
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:55,838
Epic House it's fully kick ass um if any

292
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,839
of you want uh the information on how

293
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:01,880
you yourself could rent this particular

294
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:04,839
house um the woman Pam is super cool and

295
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:06,720
uh definitely she doesn't rent it often

296
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:08,639
but when she does rent it uh it's

297
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,519
something to take advantage of for sure

298
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,680
so you'll see more of the place you'll

299
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:14,769
see more of Whistler and you'll

300
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:26,408
