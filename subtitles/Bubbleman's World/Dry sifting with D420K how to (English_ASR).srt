00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:19,549
[Music]

2
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:24,480
all right all right welcome to Bubble

3
00:00:21,399 --> 00:00:27,278
man's world I'm here with d420 K we're

4
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,118
in his uh hash cave you bet where he

5
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:31,160
makes his sift probably makes his water

6
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:33,039
hash out here as well I'm guessing mhm

7
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:36,520
right there behind you all right perfect

8
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:40,359
yeah so we got a a substantial bag of

9
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:43,120
trim little bagal bag yeah nice nice

10
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:46,840
Sugar Leaf there yeah all Sugar Leaf and

11
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:49,679
you've got your 4X 2T screen set up here

12
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:52,280
yes your 200 lines per inch and your 100

13
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:55,079
yes Bubble now right beside that in case

14
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:56,558
you got a tumble and your bubble box so

15
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:59,280
you're all covered you got the whole

16
00:00:56,558 --> 00:01:01,479
little sort of hash area here you got my

17
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,640
little bubble bag I do like to do the

18
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:06,679
water extraction as well but I once I've

19
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,040
uh since I've been turned onto the dry

20
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:11,479
sift I honestly haven't used my bubble

21
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,640
bags I feel kind of bad about it either

22
00:01:11,478 --> 00:01:14,400
but you know what John did it for the

23
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,759
longest time until I went over there and

24
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,640
got his Bubble Bags going with him and

25
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:20,560
now he's like he's he's probably made

26
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,560
three batches without me well you guys

27
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,159
were doing the uh the fresh frozen the

28
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,640
fresh frozen yeah when you can get the

29
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,759
fresh frozen that's that's something I

30
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,920
haven't tried yet and I definitely want

31
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:32,759
to

32
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,799
try that's next on the on the agenda why

33
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:37,599
don't you take them through how you go

34
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,439
about doing a batch and sort of uh I

35
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:41,359
don't know give them a brief description

36
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:43,158
of the process and then we'll take them

37
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:45,078
through the process while you're doing

38
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:48,719
that I'm going to hit that Mothership

39
00:01:45,078 --> 00:01:51,118
all right and uh all righty well right

40
00:01:48,718 --> 00:01:53,599
here I like to take my

41
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:55,359
lead take it out as take it out of the

42
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:57,078
bag you know I put my gloves on so I

43
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:58,438
don't get it cuz I use a lot throw it

44
00:01:57,078 --> 00:02:02,118
all over my

45
00:01:58,438 --> 00:02:04,359
hands put it all over here but only a

46
00:02:02,118 --> 00:02:06,478
little bit at a time nice small handful

47
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:09,478
I just drop it on just give a little

48
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:11,759
thing scoop it up put it on top of work

49
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,879
tub and I do that for the whole process

50
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:17,560
of the bag on the top screen here I

51
00:02:13,878 --> 00:02:18,679
don't grind it up into smaller things

52
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,878
and then let it run through and

53
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,360
everything like that I just take the

54
00:02:19,878 --> 00:02:25,598
leaf and just nice good Doh handed

55
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:28,040
handful rough it up no problem then once

56
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:31,399
that's done you go to the bottom screen

57
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:33,400
switch it around start sifting and start

58
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:36,480
purifying the product it is

59
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:38,439
substantially good better than anything

60
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:41,719
I've smoked is the dry sift in the full

61
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:45,560
melt bubble and uh once you get turned

62
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:47,840
on to it and unfortunately you can't

63
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:50,199
even seem to smoke the joints you can't

64
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:53,158
appreciate a good proper joint even

65
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:55,919
after you are turned onto this and

66
00:02:53,158 --> 00:02:58,318
spoiled by it

67
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:00,280
absolutely well you want to do a light

68
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:02,598
uh sure do start off and do a light

69
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,799
sifting how can uh I will uh just tell

70
00:03:02,598 --> 00:03:09,639
me where you want me and I'm right over

71
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:12,799
back I just want to get gloves on before

72
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:17,199
I start messing around with

73
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:17,200
it now I got your dry sip gloves

74
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,719
on little resin on there already oh yeah

75
00:03:25,158 --> 00:03:30,399
these have these have been used always

76
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:33,719
between the fingers and stuff right

77
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,719
M all

78
00:03:33,878 --> 00:03:40,280
right excellent love making house even

79
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:42,798
when I'm just watching people make

80
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:45,080
cash well you

81
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:48,799
know I like to

82
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:50,239
take all good buddy use little pan

83
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:53,239
underneath or

84
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:55,438
something a tough of where come should

85
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:57,719
have that ready sorry that's

86
00:03:55,438 --> 00:04:00,000
okay so we're just going to do a light

87
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:01,199
bounce on the 100 lines per inch screen

88
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,719
the 150

89
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:08,119
Micron let the resin fall down onto the

90
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:10,560
70 Micron which is 200 lines per inch in

91
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:12,719
mesh and uh that's where we will do the

92
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,400
carding that's sort of the magic screen

93
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:16,959
that a lot of people didn't know about

94
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,120
you know the 70 Micron screen is what

95
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,560
used to be the bottom catch plate on a

96
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,560
sift

97
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:26,319
box I can prepare the next one of those

98
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,720
for you too if you

99
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:32,038
want you get that one on there all right

100
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:36,360
[Music]

101
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:39,399
no that right there got it perfect I

102
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,400
just take a handful

103
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:46,670
out bounce it off of

104
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:52,449
there move around a little

105
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:52,449
[Music]

106
00:04:52,560 --> 00:05:00,560
bit nice and gentle then scoop it up

107
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:03,240
throw it in the next one the next bin

108
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,639
which will be going into the tumble

109
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:08,439
now for a secondary

110
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:10,759
bounce this is really your first initial

111
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:13,000
going for your quality being as gentle

112
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:15,759
as possible quality yes you know there's

113
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,279
a there's a sort of multitude of ways to

114
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,000
go about dry sifting but whether you're

115
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:20,638
wet washing or dry sifting you always

116
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,038
want

117
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:26,079
to make sure that you don't make any

118
00:05:24,038 --> 00:05:27,959
mistakes that affect the quality of your

119
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:30,279
first batch the heads that are willing

120
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:32,159
to fall through the screens

121
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:34,079
initially are always the biggest the

122
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,639
most bulbous the most mature the ones

123
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:38,519
that that we all want so if you can do

124
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,240
this process

125
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:43,038
properly uh it's going to definitely

126
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:45,360
make you a lot happier with h how your

127
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:47,360
dry sift turns out some people make sift

128
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,120
like this and that's all they do they do

129
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,720
gentle gentle siftings get a pure

130
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,680
product but they don't really know how

131
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,759
to clean product that is already

132
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,120
contaminated or product that's been run

133
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:02,038
in a in a pollinator or a tumbler or a

134
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:04,918
tumble now um these products tend to be

135
00:06:02,038 --> 00:06:06,680
highly contaminated between 50 and 90%

136
00:06:04,918 --> 00:06:08,359
contamination so that's where the

137
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,918
secondary part of this process really

138
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:13,360
comes in the carting one of the things

139
00:06:10,918 --> 00:06:16,359
with this between this process and just

140
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,840
taking it and say you got a handful like

141
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:21,160
this and instead of doing the gently you

142
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:22,439
go like this and you got the powdery

143
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,240
stuff and you got like that and you

144
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:26,079
start siting up like that what is the

145
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,960
difference is is the length of time of

146
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:31,719
cleaning it up period right like it's

147
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:33,638
it's a pain in the ass then it takes a

148
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:36,800
long time with the cting technique it

149
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:39,400
absolutely does yeah and that's really

150
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,120
right now the technique that's out there

151
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:43,719
there's a multitude of techniques that

152
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,478
you can learn to be very gentle and to

153
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:49,479
get an initial very clean sift but

154
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:52,959
there's really you know not that many

155
00:06:49,478 --> 00:06:54,519
methods for getting dirty resin cleaned

156
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:56,399
and right at this point in time the

157
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:58,758
technique I teach this cting technique

158
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:01,918
that we'll be doing here in a bit it's

159
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:04,120
slow and it's and it's patient work but

160
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:07,758
you get the results and Darren's hash is

161
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:07,759
a clear indication of

162
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:15,079
that so you spent quite a bit of time in

163
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:17,440
the last 4 months making dry sift well

164
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:19,680
September is when I got it when I got my

165
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:23,279
screens yeah okay well that's 5 months

166
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:25,199
and of September yeah four and a half um

167
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:26,559
August was when I August September was

168
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,639
when I was down there and you guys

169
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,560
turned me on to the dry set showed me

170
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:33,639
exactly what it was all right pop the

171
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:39,038
bowl with you yes washed it completely

172
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:41,800
melt like water yes and then uh pretty

173
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:46,000
much pretty much put me on my

174
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:48,319
ass right like really [ __ ] high

175
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,800
instantly The Taste the

176
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,360
flavors the nonc carcinog jenin

177
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,000
everything going into your body that

178
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,560
from the from the leaf material

179
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,639
everything like that was gone and then

180
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,240
uh I was turned on to it so what I

181
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,960
wanted to do was

182
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,800
make your own my own because I have I

183
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:07,478
have good enough friends that have their

184
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,478
medical licenses I have my medical

185
00:08:07,478 --> 00:08:12,279
license as well to uh to possess and do

186
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:14,038
my thing yeah it definitely helps that

187
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:15,359
both Darren and I are federally exempt

188
00:08:14,038 --> 00:08:17,598
and we're we're not actually breaking

189
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:21,400
any laws right now doing this we're just

190
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:22,918
uh uh luckily for our Canadian exemption

191
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:25,120
yeah we're in British Columbia we're

192
00:08:22,918 --> 00:08:26,639
allowed to extract the resin so that's

193
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,800
something that

194
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:31,598
uh uh ferally exempt people in the of

195
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:34,158
Canada are not allowed to do which is

196
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:36,559
ridiculous cuz you know to let someone

197
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:38,080
use something as a medicine and then not

198
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:40,079
actually extract the medicine to a

199
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:43,560
purity where it's actually

200
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:47,360
useful seems somewhat

201
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:47,359
counterproductive that's the way it is

202
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:53,879
sometimes all right going

203
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:56,399
to give them a little bit of a show

204
00:08:53,879 --> 00:09:00,879
maybe

205
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:03,440
um we could do a or something yeah we

206
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:06,958
will I'm going to give them a little uh

207
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,959
show them a little bit of your Technique

208
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:15,399
here just just drop it on keep the stuff

209
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:18,159
intact so you don't end up with a bunch

210
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:21,159
of powder on the bottom of it because

211
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:24,439
like Leaf matter because that stuff goes

212
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:26,519
through dirties it

213
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:30,640
up you know when you get down to the

214
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:32,159
Fine stuff like this right there

215
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:33,679
you don't want to keep that on there too

216
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:35,199
long while you're doing this because

217
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:36,879
this is the stuff that is going to get

218
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,600
contaminated through there and

219
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:41,200
contaminate your your prodct yeah I

220
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:43,440
carred that off immediately so we get

221
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,440
rid of that cleanliness is Godliness as

222
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:49,240
my mentor skunk the Sam man once or Sam

223
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,760
the skunkman once told me every time you

224
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,039
know you can do it every second time

225
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:57,039
depending on how much of this you got

226
00:09:53,039 --> 00:10:00,559
but um you know for the first run if you

227
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:03,439
want it to be the best you could have it

228
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:05,759
do it every time just just have yourself

229
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,320
a clean surface every time you take a

230
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:08,319
handful of

231
00:10:09,078 --> 00:10:15,078
it and do you know how long the material

232
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:19,480
was dried oh this has been dried for

233
00:10:15,078 --> 00:10:23,479
uh 2 3 weeks excellent right now yeah

234
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:25,079
it's uh it's good it's good to go i'

235
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:27,120
still like it to set up in the freezer

236
00:10:25,078 --> 00:10:30,679
after I've done it after I've made the

237
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:35,799
dry sift though to uh let it set up

238
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:41,359
better cure I know that

239
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:46,519
um the beginning took me about 3 weeks

240
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:49,079
to to to get the the full melt dry sift

241
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:51,759
unmistakably full melt dry

242
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:53,638
sift I thought I was at the one I

243
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:55,519
thought I was there at one time while

244
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:57,320
didn't it you told I sent you a video I

245
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,039
was right yeah here you go full melt

246
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:01,800
here you go buddy and that was probably

247
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:03,399
after a week oh two week a week and a

248
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:05,120
half it was cuz it was close 10 days I

249
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:07,839
think something like that it I was close

250
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:10,679
closer to to to it to finding out what I

251
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:12,160
needed to do then than I was to right so

252
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:13,799
this is this is important to listen to

253
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:16,958
because

254
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:19,479
um you really have to reassign your

255
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:21,679
definition of what full melt is when

256
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:24,480
you're trying hard to get full melt dry

257
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:26,799
sift cuz it's so much harder than

258
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,600
pulling bags when the water does all the

259
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:31,639
work of separating out all the Chafe

260
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:34,600
from the gland head this is like more of

261
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:37,240
an art form and you really have to clean

262
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:39,240
the gland heads out from everything else

263
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,959
and that's you know you when it first

264
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,680
sizzles just a little bit after a week

265
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:43,599
of cting and working you think man

266
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:46,838
that's the

267
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:49,720
Melt but but it was only the sizzle it

268
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:51,760
was the sizzle now when I messaged my

269
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:54,040
buddy sent him the video and text about

270
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:56,958
he sent me that back yeah it's starting

271
00:11:54,039 --> 00:12:00,679
to sizzle buddy you know it it took a

272
00:11:56,958 --> 00:12:02,879
great big like like a bow and twang boom

273
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:06,719
out of the balloon and popped my balloon

274
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:09,879
of I did it cuz I didn't do it yet so

275
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,639
bubble man's uh persistence and your

276
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:13,240
persistence and my persistence on doing

277
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:15,320
it not wanting to give up cuz I just

278
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:18,720
hate doing that it just doesn't

279
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:22,278
happen I got it and uh I made a video I

280
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:24,519
posted it up on uh 10 days later on uh

281
00:12:22,278 --> 00:12:26,879
yeah 10 days like 10 days later so don't

282
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:30,278
expect to get it 20 minutes later like

283
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:32,879
here he this 10 days

284
00:12:30,278 --> 00:12:37,000
after he did it for 10 days and thought

285
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:39,278
he had it it wasn't uh it wasn't easy

286
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,278
but once you get to that spot what I was

287
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:43,838
doing wasal played a bit of a that's

288
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:45,919
right I was using I was I was using the

289
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,760
tumble now and and uh using it for a

290
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:50,198
little bit longer than I needed to use

291
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:52,799
so I was putting more contam on making

292
00:12:50,198 --> 00:12:55,000
more work on myself and constantly

293
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:58,319
carting that out plus there was also the

294
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,839
thing of not knowing exactly what I what

295
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,959
I needed to use

296
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:07,160
these cards here are a key essential

297
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:09,559
piece to De to decontaminating your

298
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:11,120
product and the final end of it because

299
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:13,159
you can use it at any given time you

300
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,399
want through the whole process but we'll

301
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:17,799
show you later on on what I do with my

302
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:21,278

is a key player in every [ __ ] step of

this man and we're going to show you

305
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:26,239
with the macro lens not just this

306
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:28,279
regular lens yeah we're not going to be

307
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,360
want like those types that like to hold

we're going to do a little bit more

313
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:42,719
working here with the leaf and then

314
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:47,480
we'll come back and we'll get to the

315

too

321
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:33,560
so we're just going to just a few

00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:36,720
hundred GRS just to show you guys what

323
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:40,958
we can do with nice bone dry stuff that

324
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,959
uh that it can melt nicely

325
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:01,039

00:15:40,318 --> 00:15:43,958
so we'll just let it have we'll just

332
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:47,360
take

333
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:50,359
the easiest heads to get off of this

334
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,360
here

335
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:02,919
first

336
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:07,599
knock the [ __ ] heads out of that

337
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:07,599
bucket that are sticking to the walls

338
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:15,480
[Music]

339
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:15,479
absolutely a couple little

340
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:23,799
handfuls one and then off don't be too

341
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:27,198
don't be too rough with

342
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:29,758
it sometimes you know you can be in a

343
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:32,958
rush but

344
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:36,199
you can't be with this you just can't be

345
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:39,078
when it comes to this slow and gentle is

346
00:16:36,198 --> 00:16:43,799
actually the best process if you want

347
00:16:39,078 --> 00:16:47,439
the purest heads in the quickest way

348
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:49,439
because uh if you don't you rough it up

349
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:53,279
and you get all that all this little

350
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:55,519
dark material that's on the bottom here

351
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:57,559
you know all this kind of stuff that

352
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:00,879
gets contaminated in there if you use it

353
00:16:57,559 --> 00:17:03,359
to if you do too much of this that way

354
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:05,160
uh we're just taking the best of heads

355
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,120
right now we're going to let the tumble

356
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:10,720
now do the rest of the

357
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:14,599
work for separating and then there's

358
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,600
more work to be done sifting

359
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:21,678
that and off and then even by then

360
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,520
there's by no means is all the resin

361
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,759
going to be off this is a first stage

362
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:28,279
dry sifting gets off a certain amount of

363
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:29,720
resin uh bubble bags are obviously much

364
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:32,279
more efficient

365
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:35,640
and then final processes like coconut

366
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:37,960
oil or moonshine oil uh would be the

367
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:40,759
next uh you know full for sure fire way

368
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:44,038
of extracting you know 99.9% of the

369
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:46,160
canabo from the plant

370
00:17:44,038 --> 00:17:48,798
matter what's really nice is that it's

371
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:51,400
cold in here I live in the North

372
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:53,759

cold not too cold but cold enough that

375
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:02,558
you know we got a a little

376
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:05,880
extra bonus feature when we make our

377
00:18:02,558 --> 00:18:05,879
hash up here in the winter

378
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:16,558
time soon as I'm done mixing doing a

379

screen and pull out the resin cleaned

389

static you like CH salty is your

00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:19,400
friend some cards don't do that some do

433
00:21:17,798 --> 00:21:22,599
the original ones I gave with the bubble

434
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:24,080
box were insane how much they did it

435
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:26,519
people were like man these cards are

436
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:29,879
just getting covered it's like yeah

437
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:31,879
they're static cards but people I don't

438
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:34,400
know couldn't get the hang of

439
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:36,640
it so I ended up putting this the

440
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:39,000
different card

441
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:42,200
in do you have any of the other cards

442
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:45,919
left the old ones the old stock oh yeah

443
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:49,120
I think I'd like a box of them

444

myself all

445
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:53,918
righty clean this up a little bit

00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:07,038
okay what I'm going to do I'm going to

448
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:08,679
take this off I'm going to stump it and

449
00:22:07,038 --> 00:22:11,919
clean it up a little bit before we put

450
00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:15,200
it on the bottom okay so here we have

451
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:15,200
our our

452
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:33,720
resin optimally you'd want to use a air

453
00:22:30,278 --> 00:22:33,720
yeah Force air works good for

454
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:41,159
sure okay guys can I get you guys to

455

00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,960
pulling out the little

464
00:23:18,519 --> 00:23:24,038
gadgets yeah first things first for me I

465
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:27,038
get hairs yes

466
00:23:24,038 --> 00:23:29,200
absolutely and uh I do see some right

467
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:30,400
off the bat so what I'm going to do is

468
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:34,080
I'm going to get my

469
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:37,798
tweezers want me to tell you change sure

470
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:40,558
okay absolutely a balloon rubbed on your

471
00:23:37,798 --> 00:23:42,278
head and ran across that resin before

472
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:45,639
it's moved and Disturbed will pull out

473
00:23:42,278 --> 00:23:47,319
hairs and dust and debris with static

474
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:49,960
electricity well you know how you can

475
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:53,240
rub a balloon and I got grand kids and

476
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:54,440
have balloons I think I have one yeah I

477
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,880
mean you don't have to do it right now

478
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:58,080
but it's definitely like a future trick

479
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:59,919
that you can play around with all right

480
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:03,119
well we came came inside and we're going

481
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:06,799
to hit the Dil we got some bubble hash

482
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:08,439
OG cush and dry sift OG cush should we

483
00:24:06,798 --> 00:24:11,599
hit the Dil at 810 or you guys want to

484
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:13,200
turn it down good W taste of your rips

485
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:17,480
maybe

486
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:23,159
750 760 760 sure so when it's at a lower

487
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:27,360
temperature you 766 flavor 766 it is 767

488
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:30,360

it g

524
00:27:00,798 --> 00:27:06,558
all right well we may do another

525
00:27:04,398 --> 00:27:09,479
round but we'll see outside for some

526
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:11,639
more hash some more dry sifting and some

527
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:14,650
more importantly tips on how to get your

528
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:16,360
dry sift clean to 99% pure GL

529
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:20,440
[Music]

530
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:23,519
hits yes yo all right guys we're back

531
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:26,200
just had a fresh denail rip of uh some

532
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:29,200
dry sift yeah go figure full melt dry

533
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:31,759
sift so

534
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:34,278
I guess we're going to clean this resin

535
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:37,879
we've got the this resin's falling down

536
00:27:34,278 --> 00:27:40,119
from the the 100 lines per inch the 110

537
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:43,039
lines per inch which is about 150 Micron

538
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:45,879
it's falling onto this 200 which is a 70

539
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:48,519
Micron and uh yeah you want to take us a

540
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:50,799
little through your uh yeah you bet

541
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:53,240
through your little personalized process

542
00:27:50,798 --> 00:27:55,519
once I've got to this stage depending on

543
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:58,200
your your uh your resin heads that

544
00:27:55,519 --> 00:28:00,120
you're getting and what you're using

545
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:02,080
you're either looking at like when we

546
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:03,599
took pictures and stuff like that it' be

547
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:06,639
like like you saying about

548
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:09,240
50% is where it's at right now right now

549
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,480
to me what I've seen in my experience

550
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:14,359
from using the resin heads I was from

551
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:17,319
the material I used before which was

552
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:19,719
using UV rays to produce res more resin

553
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:25,398
heads fatter resin heads I was getting

554
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:27,759
more like 80 80% 75 85% heads I did the

555
00:28:25,398 --> 00:28:29,439
same thing as here so there were better

556
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:30,879
heads in that sort of situation there

557
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,240
are hash making strains there are

558
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,519
strains that are grown better than

559
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:37,480
others that just are perfect for sifting

560
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:39,200
they just produc Skunk Man Sam's talked

561
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:40,640
about it forever how his skunk is an

562
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,120
ultimate producer and when he makes

563
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:45,919
resin with that it just rains hard and

564
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:47,959
it rains pure you know the SLE stack was

565
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:52,000
another one he crossed that DNA genetic

566
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:54,558
SLE stack with um his skunk and it was

567
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,759
also an Uber producer of

568
00:28:54,558 --> 00:29:01,119
resin so the uh this here strin we're

569
00:28:57,759 --> 00:29:03,278
using is an OG Kush strin done by one of

570
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:05,158
my one of my friends that does a medical

571
00:29:03,278 --> 00:29:10,440
Garden gives me some of his some of a

572
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:13,640
sugar leaf and uh it's so stinky and so

573
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:15,320
nice we uh I love I love playing with it

574
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:18,360
I love smoking and everything yeah it's

575
00:29:15,319 --> 00:29:20,240
got a good bouquet it's Uber strong it's

576
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:22,158
crazy strong it's great I mean OG Kush

577
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:24,880
obviously is a great strain to make hash

578
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:27,559
with so yeah what what we've got now is

579
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,720
because we've got about 50% contaminant

580
00:29:27,558 --> 00:29:31,038
we're going to have to to do some

581
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,919
carding so I'm going to take the camera

582
00:29:31,038 --> 00:29:35,398
off the tripod for that and it'll just

583
00:29:32,919 --> 00:29:38,840
be kind of closeup of Darren working and

584
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:40,759
carding the resin and then we'll do some

585
00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:42,240
um it's probably going to take a while

586
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:43,558
how long do you think would you give an

587
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:47,319
idea I mean I don't even know what's

588
00:29:43,558 --> 00:29:50,038
here maybe 10 G or something yeah it uh

589
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:53,158
it'll take me a good hour and a half

590
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:57,240
probably if I want it 10 to 15 GS going

591
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:58,559
to turn that down to like 5 to 7 with

592
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:01,120
the 50%

593
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:02,639
um contaminant that's in there take an

594
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:04,398
hour and a half that's important for

595
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:07,519
people who are watching cuz they don't

596
00:30:04,398 --> 00:30:09,398
really you know did you have any idea

597
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:11,599
would take that kind of time the whole

598
00:30:09,398 --> 00:30:14,839
part of the taking the time was those

599
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:18,119
little tiny tiny particulates exactly

600
00:30:14,839 --> 00:30:21,480
that you can't get out without a

601
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:24,239
microscope or one of those knitting mic

602
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:27,038
knitting um yeah the big the big uh

603
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:29,079
magnic AB old ladies do needle point on

604
00:30:27,038 --> 00:30:30,599
big magnifying glass a big magnify those

605
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:32,398
are great for hash making if you could

606
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:34,678
get a big square that big and have one

607
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:37,199
of these lights you shining right down

608
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:38,880
on it kiwi had one of those glasses with

609
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,720
the light with the lights and one lens

610
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,159
over here jewelry glasses I've got them

611
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,319
ordered I've got a couple pair ordered

612
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:46,720
on pretty close down I i' prefer a

613
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:47,960
custom big that's what I would like fat

614
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,679
square that you could just put your

615
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:51,319
hands under and work with your little

616
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:53,159
actually making a coffee table I'm going

617
00:30:51,319 --> 00:30:56,439
incorporate that into it just for my own

618
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:58,519
personal good idea but anyways back to

619
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:00,679
the particul

620
00:30:58,519 --> 00:31:02,839
when my biggest problem when I was first

621
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:06,519
doing it it took me like 3 weeks to

622
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:08,278
figure out how to get the clean and it

623
00:31:06,519 --> 00:31:11,599
was the material I was using which is

624
00:31:08,278 --> 00:31:12,798
this material right now as well so what

625
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:14,278
I'm going to have to do is what I

626
00:31:12,798 --> 00:31:19,879
stumbled across

627
00:31:14,278 --> 00:31:22,240
is iTunes cards are very very staticky

628
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:24,679
the back of the iTunes card the iTunes

629
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:27,960
card comes on this does it not uh yes

630
00:31:24,679 --> 00:31:30,240
yes this is yes exactly good point

631
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:32,079
iTunes card comes onto this stuck onto

632
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,440
this like that and then you pull it off

633
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:37,558
$15 card this is what hangs on the on

634
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:40,120
the wall now this is the card that you

635
00:31:37,558 --> 00:31:42,558
want either side you use is going to be

636
00:31:40,119 --> 00:31:44,798
fine when you're running it one way it's

637
00:31:42,558 --> 00:31:46,879
going to do what we're going to show you

638
00:31:44,798 --> 00:31:49,200
on the video and I'll explain it to you

639
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:51,880
in very fine detail and show you exactly

640
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,278
how it's done with this card here and if

641
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:55,120
you stumbl across it doesn't have to

642
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:56,839
just be this one but this is the one I

643
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:59,638
stumbled across a certain type of

644
00:31:56,839 --> 00:32:02,759
plastic and it just one that one that

645
00:31:59,638 --> 00:32:05,079
holds a static charge that's really kind

646
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:06,798
of like the more static charge the more

647
00:32:05,079 --> 00:32:08,599
you're going to you know attract things

648
00:32:06,798 --> 00:32:10,960
to the card so one side is going to

649
00:32:08,599 --> 00:32:12,959
attract particulate the other side is

650
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,798
going to attract P pretty much pure

651
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,558
resin heads and there's going to be some

652
00:32:14,798 --> 00:32:19,240
pistolet hairs and stuff like that in

653
00:32:16,558 --> 00:32:23,278
there and you know like it's it's we'll

654
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:24,960
get it out but the uh what I I'll show

655
00:32:23,278 --> 00:32:26,880
you exactly what I do all right well

656
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,319
we're going to get him to start working

657
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,519
some of the resin I'm I'm going to grab

658
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:32,439
the camera and give you a better View

659
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:34,558
and uh yeah we'll be right back with

660
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:36,960
that all right we're back with Darren

661
00:32:34,558 --> 00:32:38,599
he's about to uh start working the resin

662
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,840
on the bottom

663
00:32:38,599 --> 00:32:42,798
screen it's got a nice sound you can

664
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:45,798
definitely hear that it's not 80%

665
00:32:42,798 --> 00:32:48,679
contaminant that scratchy sound on this

666
00:32:45,798 --> 00:32:51,599
on the screen granul granual yeah and

667
00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:55,720
you'll only hear that sound improve as

668
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:57,879
you improve the purity of your resin

669
00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:00,360
heads cuz that's what we're doing here

670
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:03,080
here right you understand the quality

671
00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:04,439
has already been decided we are now

672
00:33:03,079 --> 00:33:08,480
deciding the

673
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:12,200
Purity and Purity plus

674
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,200
quality equals full

675
00:33:16,398 --> 00:33:21,638
melt I like to pick out some hairs when

676
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:24,439
I see them so I keep a pair of tweezers

677
00:33:21,638 --> 00:33:27,798
on hand

678
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:31,480
always thank you no problem those was

679
00:33:27,798 --> 00:33:31,480
hairs don't just come off do they

680
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:37,879
no oh yeah you can I can feel it this

681
00:33:36,398 --> 00:33:40,359
might clean up quicker than an hour and

682
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:44,360
a half you know but

683
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:45,678
uh count on it I just said that and it's

684
00:33:44,359 --> 00:33:48,479
probably going to take me [ __ ] 2

685
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:53,679
hours but it's okay I'll do

686
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:55,079
it it's always Murphy's Law oh yeah now

687
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:59,440
what I'm doing

688
00:33:55,079 --> 00:34:02,398
here is um I like to just drag the card

689
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:05,120
over to take the first layer of stuff

690
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:08,480
off because underneath that layer it's

691
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:12,000
like gold and dirt the gold nuggets are

692
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:14,559
going to fall down more and the dirt's

693
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,000
going to stay on top and if I'm staying

694
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:18,398
you mean the opposite the dirt's going

695
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,119
to fall down through and the gold

696
00:34:18,398 --> 00:34:22,358
nuggets will stay Oh you mean in the

697
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:23,838
pile in the pile like this as it's like

698
00:34:22,358 --> 00:34:25,199
this I'm just going to scrape the top

699
00:34:23,838 --> 00:34:27,159
layer off and underneath it's going to

700
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:29,759
be more granular exactly you'll have

701
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:33,200
easier that up into a separate pile plus

702
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:35,200
it's always easier to clean small

703
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:38,158
piles you know you always want to get

704
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:40,838
hear that most yeah right so it's

705
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:43,039
different here boom I'll give her a

706
00:34:40,838 --> 00:34:44,918
flick cuz I like you're always flicking

707
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:47,159
your screen sorry buddy I use a little I

708
00:34:44,918 --> 00:34:48,878
do that right there that's what I do a

709
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:51,919
little T I always have a tool in my hand

710
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:55,960
like that and I crack my card now this

711
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:58,559
stuff here is you can hear it you can

712
00:34:55,960 --> 00:35:01,358
hear it just

713
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:03,039
scratching I love it love that noise

714
00:35:01,358 --> 00:35:04,799
because I know I'm close to what I want

715
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:06,599
to get to well here you know what let's

716
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,480
give it a pause all right and we're

717
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:10,720
going to photograph that with the macro

718
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:13,480
lens and see if we've Inc if that is

719
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:15,598
indeed a higher percentage of heads and

720
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:17,679
a lower percentage of contaminant all

721
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:21,039
right we'll be right back

722
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:21,039
okay from

723
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:24,960
here so

724
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:29,639
let

725
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:34,129
[Music]

726
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:40,219
I just work my way from this side all

727
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:43,320
the way over the other

728
00:35:40,219 --> 00:35:43,319
[Music]

729
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:50,440
side and so you know I've mentioned what

730
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:52,279
this process is and this is sort of the

731
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:54,519
simple process that so many people

732
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:56,800
didn't know over the years and I didn't

733
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:59,759
know this over the years this is carting

734
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:02,960
this is gently pushing down on this on

735
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:05,640
the resin and and spreading it across

736
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:07,079
the screen not too quickly in a nice

737
00:36:05,639 --> 00:36:09,199
cold environment and what you're going

738
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:12,000
to do is you're going to push through

739
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:14,078
the capitate stocks the cyth hairs you

740
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,559
get that hair and uh you're going to

741
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:19,359
push up Hairs To The Top as you car the

742
00:36:16,559 --> 00:36:22,799
resin as well so any contaminant stands

743
00:36:19,358 --> 00:36:25,519
out and the more you clean it funny

744
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:28,519
enough the more the contaminant stands

745
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:31,039
out the more you get out

746
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:33,719
uh put to the

747
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:36,000
side that dirty dirty stuff cuz there's

748
00:36:33,719 --> 00:36:38,439
a lot of contaminant in there m right

749
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,440
off the

750
00:36:39,318 --> 00:36:44,119
backat so I'll do a run I'll do do one

751
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:47,200
side all the way from the top to the

752
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:51,000
bottom on one one grid

753
00:36:47,199 --> 00:36:54,199
right get all this other little stuff

754
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:56,880
here I'll have a look at the card mhm

755
00:36:54,199 --> 00:36:58,239
and see okay contaminant there I'll just

756
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,838
take this and put put it over to the

757
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:02,679
side a little pile up there and then

758
00:37:00,838 --> 00:37:05,318
what I do on the other

759
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:07,358
side is I'm going to leave that on for

760
00:37:05,318 --> 00:37:08,838
some pictures I'm going to leave the

761
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:11,440
rest of it on the other side for picture

762
00:37:08,838 --> 00:37:13,400
cuz I just wanted to show you this but

763
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,119
uh then I'll take this stuff I'll have a

764
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,920
sp I'll have a spot on the side well I

765
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:18,599
do it with my other little screens sure

766
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:20,000
yeah no problem I want to leave this on

767
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:25,119
cuz this will be a good

768
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:27,800
picture absolutely and um basically once

769
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:30,800
I've made this little pile of this stuff

770
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:32,720
like trust me after you do this for 2 3

771
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,480
months the pile of this stuff you're

772
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:36,759
going to have is going to be [ __ ]

773
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,440
incredible oh yeah and then you clean

774
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:41,440
that up it just needs a slight cleaning

775
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:44,400
and it's just crazy good [ __ ] so clean

776
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:47,318
and it's it's beautiful you know ex

00:38:15,079 --> 00:38:20,160
some pictures excellent and I'm going to

791
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:24,399
start with a new card now once

792
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:27,920
again iTunes [ __ ] rule man these

793
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:30,599
cards are the the the whole key that I

794
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:32,079
stumbled across that helps me clean my

795
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:35,838
product the

796
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:35,839
fastest when you're carting

797
00:38:39,159 --> 00:38:45,799
it and I don't really press too hard I

798
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:48,440
usually just let the weight of the card

799
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:51,119
do do the work for me and that could be

800
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:54,079
why it might be taking you a long time

801
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:56,720
cuz I particularly like to press I don't

802
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:58,640
press really hard but I I kind of do a

803
00:38:56,719 --> 00:39:01,719
sort of this Stu style

804
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:04,039
thing you want me to clean on this side

805
00:39:01,719 --> 00:39:06,118
High Tunes down yes please all right so

806
00:39:04,039 --> 00:39:08,199
I would kind of do

807
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:10,680
like this sort of

808
00:39:08,199 --> 00:39:13,159
thing because you got to really push

809
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:15,759
that contaminant through and the heads

810
00:39:13,159 --> 00:39:18,799
are stronger than you think now I don't

811
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,800
want to push them too

812
00:39:20,679 --> 00:39:25,759
hard you see that's that's something I

813
00:39:23,159 --> 00:39:28,679
did not know because we never got to get

814
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:30,359
together just like this no exactly yeah

815
00:39:28,679 --> 00:39:32,159
so it's just like something you can play

816
00:39:30,358 --> 00:39:33,799
around with there's another tool to add

817
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:35,078
to the Arsenal put it a little more

818
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:37,640
pressure and then I would just literally

819
00:39:35,079 --> 00:39:40,760
spread it thin and I I don't usually

820
00:39:37,639 --> 00:39:41,879
work this much I would usually work you

821
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:44,839
know I would

822
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:47,160
clean a section of

823
00:39:44,838 --> 00:39:51,559
screen and I would go

824
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:51,559
through you know maybe something

825
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:59,318
like like this for starters M you know

826
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,318
where I could spread

827
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:05,200
thin and just sort of start working it

828
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:08,039
and I might work that for 10 or 15

829
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:09,799
minutes and then put over a little pile

830
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:11,519
and then you know get more and put that

831
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,839
in a separate pile and then I get a

832
00:40:11,519 --> 00:40:14,880
bunch of little piles and I start

833
00:40:12,838 --> 00:40:17,759
cleaning through those let's see what

834
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:20,160
you get on your your heads here too you

835
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:23,520
see you really

836
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:28,679
get a nice color on that one side hey

837
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:31,838
yes definitely and uh it's just

838
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:35,078
something that that I really love so

839
00:40:31,838 --> 00:40:37,838
much now you see the way the the lines

840
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:40,480
are there it's not a smooth transition

841
00:40:37,838 --> 00:40:43,519
anymore mhm that's where you

842
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:47,039
got your stuff on your card you need to

843
00:40:43,519 --> 00:40:49,119
clean off so that's when I'll take when

844
00:40:47,039 --> 00:40:50,800
I see that happening I'll take my card

845
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:53,358
I'll clean off the side that needs to be

846
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:55,560
cleaned off from the contaminant I'll

847
00:40:53,358 --> 00:40:57,119
have my pile and I'll start my pile over

848
00:40:55,559 --> 00:40:59,239
somewhere let's just say in the corner

849
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:59,240
here

850
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:06,239
here and then we'll see all this stuff

851
00:41:03,039 --> 00:41:09,358
here yeah the little resin melted bumps

852
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:11,639
yeah that's going to [ __ ] [ __ ]

853
00:41:09,358 --> 00:41:14,279
up yeah it's always good to keep your

854
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:16,318
card clean whether you need to just have

855
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:18,000
a bunch of them present or you know you

856
00:41:16,318 --> 00:41:19,880
can really see the difference every

857
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,679
minute or so see the difference not a

858
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:22,680
bunch of lines in

859
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:28,000
here it's always good when you're

860
00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:30,598
sifting too to bang your car and clear

861
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,960
clear it of uh you know things that it

862
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:34,519
might hold cuz those things if your if

863
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:37,199
your card's picking up a lot of stuff

864
00:41:34,519 --> 00:41:39,358
and you continue to card with that card

865
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:42,598
you'll melt that stuff to the

866
00:41:39,358 --> 00:41:44,559
card it's just

867
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:46,440
inevitable but if you want to collect it

868
00:41:44,559 --> 00:41:49,358
on the cards then just have like a

869
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:52,000
collection of cards boom

870
00:41:49,358 --> 00:41:54,199
contaminant good

871
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,239
stuff and the thing with the iTunes

872
00:41:54,199 --> 00:41:59,239
cards too that I

873
00:41:56,239 --> 00:41:59,239
like

874
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:06,519
you can flip it around use the bottom

875
00:42:04,519 --> 00:42:08,280
side yeah it's got a good amount of

876
00:42:06,519 --> 00:42:11,079
space on it bigger than your average

877
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:13,720
card

878
00:42:11,079 --> 00:42:15,839
Yeah so basically to go over this

879
00:42:13,719 --> 00:42:19,000
process again the carding is pushing

880
00:42:15,838 --> 00:42:24,358
through breakable brittle contaminant

881
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:28,358
I.E cyith hairs capitate stocks um small

882
00:42:24,358 --> 00:42:32,119
particles of leaf uh brok pieces of

883
00:42:28,358 --> 00:42:34,519
pistolet hairs and dirt and debris and

884
00:42:32,119 --> 00:42:36,480
hairs now hairs are generally easiest to

885
00:42:34,519 --> 00:42:38,880
pick out with the help of static

886
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:40,440
electricity using a balloon you can rub

887
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,358
that on your head if you're not bald and

888
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:44,039
hold the balloon over the screen and

889
00:42:42,358 --> 00:42:47,239
it'll pull small hairs and little bits

890
00:42:44,039 --> 00:42:49,639
of dust out the cing technique will do

891
00:42:47,239 --> 00:42:52,039
the rest which is going to push through

892
00:42:49,639 --> 00:42:55,199
the breakable contaminant while the

893
00:42:52,039 --> 00:42:57,558
strong gland heads they'll stay right on

894
00:42:55,199 --> 00:42:59,879
top of the screen even even with some

895
00:42:57,559 --> 00:43:02,880
decent pressure you won't push the

896
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:05,400
tricomes through um the gland heads the

897
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:10,838
Tricom heads through a screen that is

898
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:10,838
tighter than the diameter of said Tricom

899
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:16,960
head so we won't show you this whole

900
00:43:14,838 --> 00:43:19,199
process we've talked uh quite a bit

901
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:20,920
about uh what's going to happen here

902
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:23,399
what we're continuing to do Darren's

903
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:26,599
telling you a little bit about his his

904
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:29,079
uh process and what he's he's sort of

905
00:43:26,599 --> 00:43:31,160
created to or started to do for himself

906
00:43:29,079 --> 00:43:32,960
from you know the basics that he learned

907
00:43:31,159 --> 00:43:34,960
through fresh headies and

908
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,800
myself and that's what we kind of hope

909
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:39,240
for everyone we want to set a simple

910
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:41,400
parameter get you guys producing melty

911
00:43:39,239 --> 00:43:45,159
resin and then from there once you have

912
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:49,200
that Foundation of producing 98 95% pure

913
00:43:45,159 --> 00:43:51,118
gland heads um then you can start really

914
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:52,519
playing and experimenting from there

915
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:53,960
because you've got a good foundation and

916
00:43:52,519 --> 00:43:55,639
you know where you're supposed to be you

917
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:58,000
know if you're playing is leading you

918
00:43:55,639 --> 00:44:01,318
away from there or leading you above

919
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:04,159
there yes and if you keep at it and be

920
00:44:01,318 --> 00:44:06,519
patient trust me I don't have the most

921
00:44:04,159 --> 00:44:11,558
patience in the world but it was very

922
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:17,679
much worth it on every angle on every

923
00:44:11,559 --> 00:44:17,680
level I can't express it more it is

924
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:22,000
just it's a beautiful thing beautiful

925
00:44:20,358 --> 00:44:25,400
thing yeah

926
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:28,519
exactly all right well we'll uh continue

927
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:30,039
to clean here at the res and we'll get

928
00:44:28,519 --> 00:44:33,000
back to you with some macroscopic

929
00:44:30,039 --> 00:44:35,880
photographs of the final cleaned product

930
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:38,679
and of course um some denail melt hits

931
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:40,800
so keep watching Bubble man's world we

932
00:44:38,679 --> 00:44:43,239

YouTube video so you can just go click

938
00:44:56,358 --> 00:45:01,440
the link thanks a lot guys peace

939
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:11,519
peace hey guys bubble man here uh Darren

940
00:45:07,239 --> 00:45:12,719
d420 K just went to collect some plants

941
00:45:11,519 --> 00:45:15,920
uh just some branches that we're going

942
00:45:12,719 --> 00:45:18,118
to photograph and while he was gone lo

943
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:22,440
and behold I took all his dry sift that

944
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:23,440
he had here and I cleaned it up into

945
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:25,639
little

946
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:28,000
piles of

947
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:31,400
contaminant more

948
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:35,358
contaminant and then of course our

949
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:35,358
favorite there's the 70

950
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:41,318
Micron and here's the 120 Micron so he's

951
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:44,280
going to be very happy there's probably

952
00:45:41,318 --> 00:45:46,920
a you know 5 to 10 grams or four to five

953
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:48,559
well four to 10 grams in each pile I

954
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:51,358
think this one's much slower maybe only

955
00:45:48,559 --> 00:45:55,599
a couple of grams in this pile

956
00:45:51,358 --> 00:45:57,519
sorry but very nice nice little thing to

957
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:59,838
do for a buddy you know clean up is dry

958
00:45:57,519 --> 00:46:03,599
sift um of course as you guys know I

959
00:45:59,838 --> 00:46:05,000
teach the carting method I've always uh

960
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:06,680
uh taught this method for the last

961
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,880
several years I don't even know how many

962
00:46:06,679 --> 00:46:11,199
years now but it's an effective method

963
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:13,400
to clean the glandular heads and it's

964
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:15,519
what Darren's gotten very good at and I

965
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:18,559
just thought I would treat him to a

966
00:46:15,519 --> 00:46:20,960
little bit of a secret and sort of um

967
00:46:18,559 --> 00:46:24,680
you know I've learned another

968
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:27,000
method in the last 6 months that is not

969
00:46:24,679 --> 00:46:30,239
really my method to share but I'm

970
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:34,838
allowed to use it so I basically cleaned

971
00:46:30,239 --> 00:46:34,838
these piles of dry sift

972
00:46:35,039 --> 00:46:40,558
up for

973
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:40,559
Darren isn't that

974
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:45,519
beautiful anyway I hope he's going to be

975
00:46:43,318 --> 00:46:47,880
happy we'll see hey guys welcome back to

976
00:46:45,519 --> 00:46:51,759
Bubble man's world we're finishing up

977
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:53,160
the dry sift video today with d420 k um

978
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:55,800
I'm actually out of here in a couple

979
00:46:53,159 --> 00:46:57,598
hours I'm flying out but I still want to

980
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:59,440
um photograph those nuggets that you

981

982
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:03,039

00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:05,480
did we get there we got the OG Kush we

cush bubak cush okay so those three will

986
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:11,079
be coming up in macro photography living

987
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:13,639
hash that'll be really cool growing

988
00:47:11,079 --> 00:47:15,400
crazily too with the UV rays oh right

989
00:47:13,639 --> 00:47:17,078
yeah we'll talk about that a little bit

990
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:19,119
we'll talk about that a little bit um

991
00:47:17,079 --> 00:47:20,480
also you know we were going to we're

992
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:22,119
going to finish up the dry sift video

993
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:25,199
this is the last installment of the dry

994
00:47:22,119 --> 00:47:27,000
sift video um we're going to have Darren

995
00:47:25,199 --> 00:47:28,919
go outside and just basically show the

996
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,760
process that I've been sharing for the

997
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:33,440
last couple of years of how he cards and

998
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:35,079
sort of his little tricks and techniques

999
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:37,358
and stuff the cards that he uses in his

1000
00:47:35,079 --> 00:47:39,760
brushes and such and we'll talk about

1001
00:47:37,358 --> 00:47:43,358
the screens and whatnot but when he was

1002
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:45,520
away and he went and got um the cut

1003
00:47:43,358 --> 00:47:49,318
branches I actually took a bunch of his

1004
00:47:45,519 --> 00:47:52,318
dry sift and I cleaned it up for him so

1005
00:47:49,318 --> 00:47:55,880
it was like a surprise wow so yeah up

1006
00:47:52,318 --> 00:47:57,400
here in the background we have piles of

1007
00:47:55,880 --> 00:48:01,039
kind of what it looked like like

1008
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:04,079
originally this is um there there are

1009
00:48:01,039 --> 00:48:07,519
heads here stuff the stuff out of the

1010
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:11,280
tumbler exactly yeah this is all below

1011
00:48:07,519 --> 00:48:13,838
um 70 microns in size um these are also

1012
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:17,440
some contaminants these these here would

1013
00:48:13,838 --> 00:48:18,880
be actually smokable and or metable much

1014
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:20,599
stronger than this particular one even

1015
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:23,559
though to the naked eye this is looks

1016
00:48:20,599 --> 00:48:26,480
garbagey and this is lighter in color

1017
00:48:23,559 --> 00:48:29,519
but clearly these two piles um this one

1018
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:31,318
was on top of a 120 screen that I took

1019
00:48:29,519 --> 00:48:34,559
off and cleaned and this one was on top

1020
00:48:31,318 --> 00:48:37,719
of a 70 Micron screen that I took off

1021
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:41,319
and clean so I was able to um use a

1022
00:48:37,719 --> 00:48:42,838
method that I picked up uh basically a

1023
00:48:41,318 --> 00:48:44,800
method that I'm not in a position to

1024
00:48:42,838 --> 00:48:47,519
share just yet but I hope one day that I

1025
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:50,280
am I I promised obviously my mentor

1026
00:48:47,519 --> 00:48:52,079
skunkman Sam that I would not mention it

1027
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:53,559
or or show show the method I should say

1028
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:56,000
but I am allowed to use the method and I

1029
00:48:53,559 --> 00:48:58,680
can that's respect brother respect you

1030
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,838
know took me yeah I waited 19 years to

1031
00:48:58,679 --> 00:49:02,598
learn such a thing and now that I've

1032
00:49:00,838 --> 00:49:05,119
learned it I'm just going to be very

1033
00:49:02,599 --> 00:49:07,200
respectful and uh just I give all the

1034
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:08,680
props to skunkman S you got to earn it

1035
00:49:07,199 --> 00:49:11,519
it's a huge thing to look down at this

1036
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:14,039
it looks surreal have you ever felt hash

1037
00:49:11,519 --> 00:49:17,358
well no that's the thing like I i' this

1039
00:49:17,358 --> 00:49:22,039
it's like

1040
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:24,440

00:49:32,519 --> 00:49:37,920
simple half second of a pinch and this

1047
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:39,798

[ __ ] this here uh zoi

1098
00:52:14,239 --> 00:52:22,838
Kush and uh it the GU just

1099
00:52:18,519 --> 00:52:26,358
um the formula the lighting this is

1100
00:52:22,838 --> 00:52:28,400
grown for the tri chromes so as much and

1101
00:52:26,358 --> 00:52:30,400
as as big of Tri Chrome you can get and

1102
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:32,559
the way they do this look pretty fat

1103
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:35,000
nice they don't use a th they don't use

1104
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:38,200
thousand Waters they use 600s they use

1105
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:41,400
UV rays UV lights that hangs all over

1106
00:52:38,199 --> 00:52:44,358
the place cuz that's key to building

1107
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:45,920
they uh they do a job they are

1108
00:52:44,358 --> 00:52:48,960
incredible of what they do want to throw

1109
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:48,960
that one in there she broke

1110
00:52:49,159 --> 00:52:54,159
off now that's the OG Kush now where

1111
00:52:52,519 --> 00:52:55,719
would you like to put it so that we

1112
00:52:54,159 --> 00:52:57,759
don't have to put it back in so you want

1113
00:52:55,719 --> 00:52:59,199
to take some good um you know what I

1114
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:00,760
don't have anything set up right off the

1115
00:52:59,199 --> 00:53:02,759
top of my head just put it on the box

1116
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:04,400
here yeah I mean honestly the way it is

1117
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:05,680
it can lay anywhere and I can just come

1118
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,960
over and as you know what I mean like

1119
00:53:05,679 --> 00:53:09,239
there's enough of it that won't be

1120
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:10,639
touching that it'll be perfect okay so

1121
00:53:09,239 --> 00:53:15,000
and then what is this one here that's

1122
00:53:10,639 --> 00:53:18,159

1131
00:53:37,798 --> 00:53:41,920
top or nothing it's just a side branch

1132
00:53:39,719 --> 00:53:47,159

there for oh

1148
00:54:25,358 --> 00:54:30,078
yeah look at the resin totally different

1149
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:32,079
structural totally completely different

1150
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:34,839
herb Al together but

1151
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:37,160
yet really pretty it almost reminds me

1152
00:54:34,838 --> 00:54:39,119
of some of skunkman Sam's skunk cuz this

1153
00:54:37,159 --> 00:54:41,159
is the way it grew it just grow nugget

1154
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:43,680
with very little leaf and before anyone

1155
00:54:41,159 --> 00:54:45,759
had anything like it he had it he bred

1156
00:54:43,679 --> 00:54:47,199
it it came out people were flipping out

1157
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:50,280
over it and that's when I first saw this

1158
00:54:47,199 --> 00:54:52,159
I said old school cuz it's all bud you

1159

can see this 1 2 3 four five you can

1160
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:56,920
count the leaves on

1161
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:58,599
it you know yeah yeah

1162
00:54:56,920 --> 00:55:01,079

headyy dry sift my final step anyways

1178
00:55:36,358 --> 00:55:40,598
that I got from you and this is where I

1179
00:55:39,039 --> 00:55:42,960
like to finish we could do the big

1180
00:55:40,599 --> 00:55:44,440
screens but I like to sit down I got a

1181
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:47,159
screen in front of me I got the big

1182
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:50,480
screen I got the stereo I can enjoy sit

1183
00:55:47,159 --> 00:55:53,399
down relax and do it now this side is

1184
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:55,358
the side that I use my brush I use my

1185
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:56,920
card these are my two favorite tools for

1186
00:55:55,358 --> 00:55:58,598
the 70 screen

1187
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:00,559
and I'm taking my final product and I'm

1188
00:55:58,599 --> 00:56:02,920
sifting it across you know I'll drag it

1189
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:05,519
across like like we were showing last

1190
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:08,079
night and you we thing with

1191
00:56:05,519 --> 00:56:11,358
that as we do

1192
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:13,920
that the cart will get

1193
00:56:11,358 --> 00:56:16,558
dirty we'll start with a nice clean edge

1194
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:18,838
here you can see that you take your

1195
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:21,640
product and as you're go use only one

1196
00:56:18,838 --> 00:56:24,558
side to to drag it the other side don't

1197
00:56:21,639 --> 00:56:26,798
drag it with and as you do that it's

1198
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:28,760
what these these cards I find most is

1199
00:56:26,798 --> 00:56:30,110
where I get the most contaminant I trct

1200
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:31,920
the most

1201
00:56:30,110 --> 00:56:34,920
[Music]

1202
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:36,440
contaminant on this side of my card now

1203
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:38,200
this side of my card I'll take after

1204
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:40,798
I've got some contaminant on it and I'll

1205
00:56:38,199 --> 00:56:43,919
just brush it off over here put it to

1206
00:56:40,798 --> 00:56:46,239
the side this side has nice clean

1207
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:48,318
looking stuff there's lots of there's

1208
00:56:46,239 --> 00:56:50,479
lots of dirted like um contaminant in

1209
00:56:48,318 --> 00:56:52,440
there too but it's not the leaf matter

1210
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:55,358
it's the stocks that hold the resin

1211
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:56,519
gland and the resin glands I'll take

1212
00:56:55,358 --> 00:56:59,798
that all together and I'll I'll take

1213
00:56:56,519 --> 00:57:02,519
that aside I'll just put it on a nice

1214
00:56:59,798 --> 00:57:05,159
spot and after working this for probably

1215
00:57:02,519 --> 00:57:07,159
10 hours or 3 weeks or so you've got a

1216
00:57:05,159 --> 00:57:09,399
nice pile of that really pure looking

1217
00:57:07,159 --> 00:57:11,519
stuff clean and then I can clean that up

1218
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:14,599
afterwards and get some nice clean stuff

1219
00:57:11,519 --> 00:57:17,318
but as I'm doing that I'm cleaning

1220
00:57:14,599 --> 00:57:19,880
this and this card really attracts the

1221
00:57:17,318 --> 00:57:22,880
contaminant it took off

1222
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:24,920
probably hours worth of sifting for me

1223
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:26,760
after I sift for a few minutes I look at

1224
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:29,440
the card contaminant

1225
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:30,880
boom I take it off I don't have to do

1226
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:34,358
that every time with this time let it

1227
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:34,358
build up you don't have to scrape it

1228
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:41,880
off now it's all over to the side moved

1229
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:44,199
it onto the one side that pile nice pile

1230
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:46,400
on the card more contaminant let's get

1231
00:57:44,199 --> 00:57:46,399
that

1232
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:52,599
off saves pushing it through the screens

1233
00:57:50,318 --> 00:57:55,480
and taking more time doing it it

1234
00:57:52,599 --> 00:57:57,720
quickens the process I can't stress it

1235
00:57:55,480 --> 00:58:01,440
any type of C that the TRX a static

1236
00:57:57,719 --> 00:58:02,959
electricity will do that and that is one

1237
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:05,720
of your best friends when it comes to

1238
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:08,079
discarding your your sift

1239
00:58:05,719 --> 00:58:10,639
period I don't want to lose too much of

1240
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:12,480
that there's some really nice buildup on

1241
00:58:10,639 --> 00:58:14,639
that can you see that bubble man M

1242
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:17,519
that's beautiful so I take that just put

1243
00:58:14,639 --> 00:58:20,199
her back in the pile just leave that

1244
00:58:17,519 --> 00:58:23,239
there just leave it alone and just get

1245
00:58:20,199 --> 00:58:25,798
back to going back and forth on my

1246
00:58:23,239 --> 00:58:28,399
sift you can use more pressure for sure

1247
00:58:25,798 --> 00:58:31,318
on your your screen okay but it depends

1248
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:33,760
on if that screen is touching is that

1249
00:58:31,318 --> 00:58:36,239
screen how far is that screen from

1250
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:38,480
underneath the plate that it's on oh

1251
00:58:36,239 --> 00:58:41,759
that much space yes so then that's

1252
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:44,240
plenty enough hey you can definitely

1253
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:46,880
especially because it's cold in

1254
00:58:44,239 --> 00:58:48,558
here where that process of what I did

1255
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:50,519
yesterday which was hold the card even

1256
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:52,039
more flat rather than just use the edge

1257
00:58:50,519 --> 00:58:54,599
of the card I'll hold it down and use

1258
00:58:52,039 --> 00:58:56,720
like a third of the card and really

1259
00:58:54,599 --> 00:58:59,359
pancake it out

1260
00:58:56,719 --> 00:59:02,519
that process in a cold

1261
00:58:59,358 --> 00:59:04,440
environment Works fairly well and you

1262
00:59:02,519 --> 00:59:07,519
can be

1263
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:10,079
fairly aggressive yeah fair you know not

1264
00:59:07,519 --> 00:59:12,400
overly but fairly you can actually

1265
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:14,760
really press decently on that and what

1266
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:16,639
because the bottom line is the the resin

1267
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:19,680
heads are strong and they will stay on

1268
00:59:16,639 --> 00:59:21,199
top the contaminant will break and be

1269
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:23,480
brittle especially in the cold and

1270
00:59:21,199 --> 00:59:26,318
they'll push through but they don't push

1271
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:28,159
through easy and that's where it comes

1272
00:59:26,318 --> 00:59:31,079
through that you have to do this over

1273
00:59:28,159 --> 00:59:32,199
and over and over look at how dark it is

1274
00:59:31,079 --> 00:59:36,318
dark

1275
00:59:32,199 --> 00:59:38,358
side Light Side mhm that clear as day

1276
00:59:36,318 --> 00:59:40,838
one's green and one's

1277
00:59:38,358 --> 00:59:43,199
gold and this stuff here you can still

1278
00:59:40,838 --> 00:59:44,519
do if you took this stuff here and use

1279
00:59:43,199 --> 00:59:46,960
bubble man's

1280
00:59:44,519 --> 00:59:49,000
method you would definitely get some

1281
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:50,358
more out of that oh yeah exactly cuz we

1282
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,239
photographed it yesterday and we'll

1283
00:59:50,358 --> 00:59:54,598
inlay that photo there's definitely

1284
00:59:52,239 --> 00:59:58,038
glandular heads still on The Greener

1285
00:59:54,599 --> 00:59:58,039
Side it just tends to

1286
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:02,939
[Music]

1287
01:00:53,610 --> 01:00:59,358
[Music]

1288
01:00:56,079 --> 01:01:00,798
a slice and I hope to learn more and if

1289
01:00:59,358 --> 01:01:02,679
like bubble man said if there's stuff

1290
01:01:00,798 --> 01:01:06,280
you're learning please share we'd love

1291
01:01:02,679 --> 01:01:09,719
to hear about it oh yeah we on D we'll

1292
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:13,720
see you guys later peace

1297
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:24,798
me his town he introduced me to his

1298
01:01:21,559 --> 01:01:26,880
