1
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:08,919
I don't think they can come up with a

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,839
cat evidence on cannabis that sort of

3
00:00:08,919 --> 00:00:13,300
turns it into something so dangerous

4
00:00:10,839 --> 00:00:15,280
that you can sustain treating it in this

5
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:16,689
in this restricted way and we really

6
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:19,929
need to acknowledge that all of these

7
00:00:16,689 --> 00:00:22,210
years we lied about it most people get

8
00:00:19,929 --> 00:00:23,829
their information from a five-second

9
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:25,539
trip on television or a couple of

10
00:00:23,829 --> 00:00:27,038
paragraphs in the newspapers

11
00:00:25,539 --> 00:00:28,300
that's one of the major benefits of

12
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,699
legalization there's a lot more people

13
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:33,489
are gonna consume and we've seen what a

14
00:00:30,699 --> 00:00:35,559
hundred years give or take of stigma

15
00:00:33,488 --> 00:00:37,359
have done to just change everyone's

16
00:00:35,558 --> 00:00:39,308
perceptions is this plan to the point

17
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:41,979
where they bear so little resemblance to

18
00:00:39,308 --> 00:00:44,049
the actual properties of the plan and

19
00:00:41,979 --> 00:00:45,759
it's terrifying to see how them and this

20
00:00:44,049 --> 00:00:48,369
information can lead to so much software

21
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:49,689
but that's still it's don't matter not

22
00:00:48,369 --> 00:00:51,308
from happen you don't I mean in the way

23
00:00:49,689 --> 00:00:53,079
that legalized reason is rolling out

24
00:00:51,308 --> 00:00:55,599
there's there's still gonna be another

25
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:56,950
fight thank God I think that you know

26
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,620
there's there's different functions in

27
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:02,050
society I think activism is an important

28
00:00:59,619 --> 00:01:04,299
function I think having enforcement is

29
00:01:02,049 --> 00:01:07,569
an important function you know and then

30
00:01:04,299 --> 00:01:11,920
I think you have education politicians

31
00:01:07,569 --> 00:01:15,159
who who catering to death emotional

32
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:17,500
reactions in terms of votes you know

33
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:20,219
they don't stop to talk rationally

34
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:22,509
reasonably most of the time about things

35
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:24,700
and there's people suffering there's

36
00:01:22,509 --> 00:01:26,170
people you know countless people though

37
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,549
you see somebody who's you know going

38
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:28,929
for attentive to withdrawal and you can

39
00:01:27,549 --> 00:01:32,259
do something to alleviate some of that

40
00:01:28,929 --> 00:01:35,140
pain you know you know there's so many

41
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:37,040
good things that happen we are expected

42
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:39,319
to come up with innovative solutions

43
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,970
until that opioid crisis we find

44
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:42,889
ourselves after the transitions are

45
00:01:40,969 --> 00:01:45,349
always you know it's like giving birth

46
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:47,480
then you're like you know it's you know

47
00:01:45,349 --> 00:01:49,250
what intense process that's why I say

48
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:51,079
move things forward it's not just about

49
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:52,670
the things that we're very actively

50
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:54,859
trying to move forward here but like

51
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:56,450
what could we do now well why do you

52
00:01:54,859 --> 00:01:57,500
need to protect kids from cannabis last

53
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,719
time I checked kids have

54
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:02,719
endocannabinoids systems - yeah what the

55
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:04,730
doctor yeah he looked at me you said

56
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:07,760
you're a desperate mother reaching

57
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:10,879
you're grasping at straws I told him I

58
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:12,349
was like yeah I am he said what are you

59
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:13,789
gonna do if I don't give you this

60
00:02:12,349 --> 00:02:15,680
prescription I said I'm gonna go home

61
00:02:13,789 --> 00:02:17,150
and I'm gonna do it anyways you can't

62
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,040
deny me that your chance to save my

63
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:20,539
child cannabinoids regulate all

64
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:23,299
biological functions through the

65
00:02:20,539 --> 00:02:23,870
endocannabinoid system so what's the

66
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,930
problem

67
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:29,890
legalization I mean it's coming for

68
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:33,050
everybody and then cannabis work so

69
00:02:29,889 --> 00:02:36,019
legalization kicking in especially at

70
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:37,700
this time it really is important to be

71
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:40,400
talking about these other things I also

72
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:42,859
have faith in the activists and the next

73
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,140
generation to just continue this

74
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:46,970
movement I just see this is a point in

75
00:02:45,139 --> 00:02:51,879
time I don't see this is the destination

76
00:02:46,969 --> 00:02:53,780
and I think if we all keep that in mind

77
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:59,840
there have been some pretty big

78
00:02:53,780 --> 00:03:02,259
victories but the ones I respond to the

79
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,580
most and the quickest are the parents

80
00:03:02,259 --> 00:03:06,859
because I know I've been there it's

81
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:11,300
scary and when you try to take on a

82
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:13,250
medical system that's really scary I

83
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:15,439
think if there was a regulatory market

84
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:17,509
in place it might be a real good

85
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:21,289
transition but there isn't anything in

86
00:03:17,509 --> 00:03:23,659
place and so you know nobody big not

87
00:03:21,289 --> 00:03:25,579
just a gray area but a great timeline of

88
00:03:23,659 --> 00:03:30,620
when that's gonna be and when those

89
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:33,320
shops can open up that's what all those

90
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:37,129
guys are baby but at the end of the day

91
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:38,900
I mean the plan is gonna be a legal

92
00:03:37,129 --> 00:03:39,889
entity in Canada and we can do anything

93
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,289
we want with it

94
00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:45,019
I mean we win just change their mind

95
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:47,060
about one little thing you know and then

96
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:49,280
come back and then one more thing you

97
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,360
know and then one more well I think we

98
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,159
need all the stories I mean they're all

99
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,650
stories right a clinical trial to type a

100
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:56,870
story there's also a piece of that story

101
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:59,510
where it's so expensive to be able to

102
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:02,509
tell that story that it limits who gets

103
00:03:59,509 --> 00:04:04,159
to speak so I think what's so great

104
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:06,530
about something like move the movement

105
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:08,659
is it's inviting other people who have

106
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:10,400
wisdom and you have important

107
00:04:08,659 --> 00:04:12,409
information and important stories to

108
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,560
share to share those stories as well so

109
00:04:12,409 --> 00:04:17,719
it's not just this one story where the

110
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:21,819
entrance of the storytelling Club is is

111
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,820
incredibly high that was awesome
