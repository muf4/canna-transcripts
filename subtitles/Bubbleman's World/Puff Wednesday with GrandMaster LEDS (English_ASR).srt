go put it right on top of that Bo from

36
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:51,809
my understanding this goes that's

37
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:54,848
last same with this that's probably the

38
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,849
[Music]

39
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:01,840
inside

40
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,840
joint

41
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:08,840
pieces okay so the L I said these must

42
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:11,159
go in height Johnny stop it you said you

43
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,598
weren't doing anything I haven't done

44
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:13,959
this before as you can see you're doing

45
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:17,199
everything

46
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:22,120
John what the heck I you have some

47
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:24,079
dabs um give me a um like I said um

48
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:26,319
what's nice about doing tents and doing

49
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,879
this for so long it's really quite easy

50
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:30,399
we'll start with a base guys and really

51
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:31,959
just quick and simple everything has got

52
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,400
to lock them always have them to the

53
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:35,000
inside so that way they don't get kicked

54
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,640
or pushed on the inside so always make

55
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,959
sure they go on the inside when put

56
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:40,919
bling like EXC saided I guess I've done

57
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,199
this before I think you've done it a few

58
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:44,439
times is there one other tall one is

59
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:46,759
this it right

60
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:48,359
here that's a one now I'm looking here

61
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:50,239
so I'm seeing some bottoms here so this

62
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,720
here's got a bottom and bottom so does

63
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:55,519
look right well because it's not two of

64
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:57,560
them are ones and two of them are twos

65
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,640
are the ones in the twos exactly the

66
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:04,560
same yeah they oh no are they yeah the

67
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:06,639
same one all right we're looking at here

68
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,120
is on the bottom have these these have

69
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:12,559
to be the ones in between no those ones

70
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,680
are going up too stacked too high oh

71
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,759
okay that's that's what got me but look

72
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:19,879
on the bottom here John we need to have

73
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:21,878
the two opposing are ones and the two

74
00:03:19,878 --> 00:03:23,318
opposing are twos I don't know why they

75
00:03:21,878 --> 00:03:25,840
have it that way but so they got ones

76
00:03:23,318 --> 00:03:27,798
and two just make you got a one you got

77
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,039
a one there I got a one here I got a two

78
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:30,840
here okay well that's a two and then

79
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:34,438
this

80
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:37,360
one which I'm almost almost certain it's

81
00:03:34,438 --> 00:03:39,560
a one yeah it's a one so I'll just

82
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:43,080
replace it with this too maybe it means

83
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:44,959
nothing but you know what let's just try

84
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:48,360
to follow the simple

85
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:51,199
rule follow the rules that goes up the

86
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:54,000
other way see on the bottom gotta I see

87
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:54,000
now so there's

88
00:03:54,079 --> 00:04:00,920
no three and a three and a

89
00:03:57,639 --> 00:04:05,679
three and a four or sorry here's a four

90
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:05,679
oh yeah I need fours four first four

91
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:12,438
first this must be funny to

92
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:14,719
watch it's like yeah we haven't built a

93

94
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:18,120
but

95
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:20,358
hey there's a

96
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,240
one I guess we're going to need to do

97
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:25,120
our ones

98
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:28,400
again yeah so which ones are ones these

99
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:31,038
ones right so a one will go here as well

100
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:32,719
want to get another

101
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:36,279
okay this do all come together guys this

102
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:39,280
is the magic right here watch the

103
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:41,439
confusion watch oh yeah right off the

104
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:44,879

one I

108
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:55,959
think you can just hold that for a

109
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:55,959
second goes like

110
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,280

this last part you didn't even get to

112
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:08,038

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,280
that's tripped out they saw it they're

114
00:05:08,038 --> 00:05:11,079
doing it they're watching a little bit

115
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:12,559
of the madness that's going on in my

116
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:14,758

00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,319
that

169
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:08,918
mentioning it this already comes with

170
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:11,240
the bottom plate the only thing reason

171
00:08:08,918 --> 00:08:13,598
why I mentioned the other thing is it's

172
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:18,800
nice to have a hard tray that you can

173
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:21,120
screw in a hose that then leads to um uh

174
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,879
a sump

175
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:27,399
pump like you spin it it's two so then

176
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:28,840
I'll put one of my down we already have

177
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:30,918
one ends you don't you only need to put

178
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:34,199
that on one end and it has to be on the

179
00:08:30,918 --> 00:08:36,158
right one or it won't line up this one

180
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:39,519
can go right here that's the beauty of

181
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:39,519
knowing whether you did it right

182
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:47,599
enough no I just I think it's easier

183
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:49,839
than you we don't have to risk any this

184
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:53,360
is this is the Learning lesson number

185
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:55,080
two now now the best part open this up

186
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,278
prop they make this so you can open up

187
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,000
you know have to do this [ __ ] we just

188
00:08:56,278 --> 00:09:01,000
did let's make sure we do that's kind of

189
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
what I was hoping oh totally butchered

190
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,078
it last time yeah a total butcher like

191
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,278
stop we couldn't have got my T any direr

192
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:08,000
that's for sure so let's take a look

193
00:09:06,278 --> 00:09:10,159
here this going to be this is the bottom

194
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,519
plate take a look the bottom cuz it's a

195
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:15,039
t remember the Bottom's actually in the

196
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:16,879
middle if you look at the yeah the the

197
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:20,039
bottom is in the middle the bottom is

198
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:20,039
right that

199
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:26,000
way come right out of here we going well

200
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:27,240
the Bottom's going to go up it's going

201
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,120
to wrap

202
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:31,120
around okay

203
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:40,518
the team so we got to open this

204
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:47,240
up there's the botom

205
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,879
the

206
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:54,879
we getting this boys I feel like we're

207
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:58,399
doing it I feel like we're really doing

208
00:09:54,879 --> 00:10:00,159
it know if you kind have fun while you

209
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,200
know building

210
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:05,799
some Lego tents with your

211
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:09,440
buddies are fun these are fun I'm explow

212
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:12,359
down wait keep it

213
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:15,680
simple nice about this this one comes

214
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,680
off on the

215
00:10:16,278 --> 00:10:23,519
floor get you on this side

216
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:23,519
here this corner up here this corner

217
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:31,039
here

218
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:36,360
tight well would you look at that and

219
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:38,838
now we just walk this around walk this

220
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,839
around

221
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,760
get check your

222
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:52,359
partner come on out here take a bow guys

223
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:55,279
everybody Mark Thomas Mark come on out

224
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:58,039
here just a second I'm going to

225
00:10:55,279 --> 00:11:02,480
[Music]

226
00:10:58,039 --> 00:11:04,480
finish done P okay ready Let's Take a

227
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:08,959
Bow there you

228
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:13,320
go that was F out well see that's how

229
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:14,838
it's done good job guys awesome brother

230
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,200
here this is better we're just having

231
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:20,920
fun we're just having fun of a tent that

232
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:22,360
was fun let's get that light out boys to

233
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:24,039
me it's all about this light no offense

234
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:26,440
to the tents and the pumps and the

235
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:29,559
thises and the thats and the

236
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:31,639
reservoir but this light

237
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:35,000
careful too it might be oh it's upside

238
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:37,639
down surprised it made it here okay got

239
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,039
this tent what's that completely flip

240
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:41,360
the tatter what do you

241
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:43,000
mean oh it's totally upside down I was

242
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,079
just going to say it matter if we flip

243
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,799
it upside down no do you know what

244
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:47,199
there's a hole on there's a vent on the

245
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:50,759
bottom of them like they put them on the

246
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,759
ground yeah just flip it let's flip

247
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,839
it

248
00:11:56,958 --> 00:12:03,399
oh that's done pretty s

249
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:06,160
boom pretty good good

250
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:08,240
job they missed the flip all right now

251
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:10,199
we get this

252
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,799
ridiculous this right here is what

253
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:16,240
brought Thomas and I

254
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:17,838
together Tula board the tarantula Bor so

255
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:21,560
why don't you start talking a little bit

256
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:25,199
about this Beast so this is the world's

257
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:28,078
most diverse sophisticated light it's a

258
00:12:25,198 --> 00:12:30,559
four Channel light that has the ability

259
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:33,078
to do anything spectrum that any company

260
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:35,719
has ever made before and spectrums that

261
00:12:33,078 --> 00:12:38,039
no one has ever made it can go Bluer or

262
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:40,639
redder than any light has ever had the

263
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:43,879
ability to go and it also is the very

264
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:47,360
first LED light that can do an HPS

265
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:50,078
Spectrum dude it's so sick it feels good

266
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:52,039
it's heavy it's a is this 54 56 it's

267
00:12:50,078 --> 00:12:54,319
5600 and you can see with the diodes on

268
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:57,799
the cool Channel they got we've got Evo

269
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:59,879
mint diodes with EVO 301h diodes and

270
00:12:57,799 --> 00:13:02,759
this is what allows us to to achieve a

271
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:05,519
double blue wavelength with a 437 NM and

272
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:08,838
450 and this is our warm white Channel

273
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:12,000
That's 2200 Kelvin and then we have 660

274
00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:15,240
NM and 730 NM di temperature range of

275
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,600
this light it's 18800 kelv to 9,000 kin

276
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:21,278
but we can make special units for R&amp;D or

277
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:24,000
on request that go up to 12,000 Kelvin

278
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:26,399
the reason why we don't have it 1,800 to

279
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,440
12,000 Kelvin is because you would be

280
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,198
using one driver way more than the other

281
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:32,600
and trying to have as much balance as

282
00:13:30,198 --> 00:13:35,278
possible so there's a lot that we can do

283
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:38,040
with this light we can do anything we

284
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:39,559
can do any how many preset spectrums we

285
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:42,519
have 60 to choose from but there's

286
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:43,719
hundreds that we can actually do wow and

287
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:46,278
what what's really cool about our

288
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:47,920
controller that just finished this week

289
00:13:46,278 --> 00:13:49,480
um we can literally do multiple

290
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:51,240
spectrums throughout the day so we could

291
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:54,199
start the day off with our base spectrum

292
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:56,639
and then 6 hours in switch it to Blue

293
00:13:54,198 --> 00:13:58,479
for an hour then go to Red for an hour

294
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:01,198
then back to our base spectrum and then

295
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,839
we can have 730 nanm on until like after

296
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:06,599
the lights go out so 730 nanomer is in

297
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,120
HPS lights it's not in most LED lights

298
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,278
you can use it to put the plants to

299
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:12,480
sleep after the lights go out normally

300
00:14:10,278 --> 00:14:14,879
it takes 2 hours for your plants to fall

301
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,800
asleep this does it in 15 minutes this

302
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:18,759
allows you to finish your crops 3 to

303
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:20,439
seven days faster we've even seen

304
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:22,600
someone recently named Mitten master who

305
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:25,560
finished a crop two weeks earlier

306
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:27,360
testing these things out 14 days which

307
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:29,319
is insane that's a big deal for a

308
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,600
commercial outfit huge when it comes

309
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:33,639
down to power efficiency everything

310
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,278
drawing smiling as he was talking of

311
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:38,198
course I'm smiling get over here on

312
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:39,639
camera Johnny I was you a little

313
00:14:38,198 --> 00:14:41,679
conversation Johnny got a lot more

314
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:44,198
knowledge when it comes to the lighting

315
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:46,719
than I do whole thing looking at smiling

316
00:14:44,198 --> 00:14:48,120
and stuff like that talking about really

317
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,440
love about the light what you talk about

318
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,240
it's the multiple Spectrum what we're

319
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,320
looking at and controlling those

320
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,680
spectrums and be able to take in like

321
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:57,680
now think of the future think it it's

322
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:59,198
100 years and you able to grow canvas

323
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:01,159
cucumbers peers Tomatoes that's what

324
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:03,159
this lightel to do it can grow all

325
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:05,360
different types of products it it can

326
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:08,198
lead R&amp;D if you're trying to test what

327
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,240
spectrums are the absolute best to do um

328
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:12,000
this it there's universities that are

329
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,879
going to be using this across the world

330
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,000
to be testing stuff out so dude can we

331
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:19,198
talk a little bit about the efficiency

332
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,360
of the light and how it plays into

333
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:25,319
rebates in North America sure well so

334
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,879
for efficiency well you can it doesn't

335
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:29,120
have to be the most efficient to qualify

336
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:31,958
for a rebate um but it's got to be over

337
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:35,639
2.1 micro moles per Jewel but why this

338
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:37,638
is so important um is the efficiency the

339
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:39,919
efficacy of this light so you're getting

340
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:42,639
the most amount of light per watt so say

341
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:44,879
for example I can we could put in any

342
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:47,318
company Spectrum except for this light's

343
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:49,559
going to put out more light per watt now

344
00:15:47,318 --> 00:15:51,278
when we were designing this light we've

345
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:53,599
changed this design three different

346
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:56,240
times actually and like this thing took

347
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,959
over a year to actually develop with us

348
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,639
constantly changing it or running into

349
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,439
different obstacles we actually started

350
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,560
with four different driver boxes cuz

351
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:06,759
it's a four Channel light and we just

352
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:08,838
realized it was was creating too many

353
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:10,440
connections for us and there were just

354
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:13,600
so many different things that we changed

355
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:15,160
and there was uh we start we actually oh

356
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,720
sorry no no you have't I was just going

357
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:18,039
to you keep going as you're talking as

358
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,040
I'm looking at this cuz of course I'm

359
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:21,799
excited right I want to get this thing

360
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:22,838
turned off dude how about this ballast

361
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:24,559
see that's what we're looking at that's

362
00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:26,720
our driver box and we designed it like

363
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:29,518
this so if there's ever an issue we can

364
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,800
just swap that out I like it I like it a

365
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,480
lot so this what you're talking about

366
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:34,519
the drivers that are in there yeah it's

367
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,159
got four it's got four it's got four

368
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:39,159
different drivers we use infant Tronics

369
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:41,120
which is the world's best drivers and um

370
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:43,559
we just don't cut any corners and it's

371
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,600
the best of the best that's and this is

372
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:47,599
like a if now if you have the

373
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,959
infrastructure to be able to run these

374
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,199
because it does can it's possible to go

375
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:55,198
up to 1500 watts even though it's

376
00:16:52,198 --> 00:16:56,919
designed to run at 700 Watts so it does

377
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:58,958
you do need a bigger infrastructure to

378
00:16:56,919 --> 00:17:01,278
run these but the diversity and the

379
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:04,279
Competitive Edge that you have is just

380
00:17:01,278 --> 00:17:06,959
it's endless power Le 240 if you going

381
00:17:04,279 --> 00:17:09,599
to run numb so we have one option of

382
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:12,519
being able to go a driver set that does

383
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:15,159
120 to 277 volt that auto converts and

384
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:16,639
then we also have 277 to 480 volt oh

385
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:18,000
perfect so you got both consumptions

386
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,480
yeah you you definitely well you can we

387
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,439
can do any plug we can make it

388
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:25,038
compatible with any country didn't

389
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:26,959
someone ask us for 347 recently yes talk

390
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:29,960
about that well do you know what it's

391
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:33,000
what did that mean well 90% of actually

392
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:35,120
large facilities are on high voltage and

393
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,038
they're using the 347 I don't personally

394
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:38,439
like messing with it myself if I could

395
00:17:37,038 --> 00:17:40,440
avoid it because when you get high

396
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:42,360
voltage if you get a shock you can it's

397
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:44,080
high power it's high power it can really

398
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:46,199
hurt but what it's efficient it's it's

399
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:47,839
it's more direct power and it's it's

400
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,360
more efficient but you also are freeing

401
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:51,279
up more amperage and that's the big

402
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:54,038
thing about high voltage so if I'm going

403
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:56,319
from 120 a regular plug to 240 I'm

404
00:17:54,038 --> 00:17:58,480
freeing up double the amperage in my

405
00:17:56,319 --> 00:18:00,119
panel so wa and when we get into

406
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,919
amperage we talk about that so when we

407
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:03,839
used to run old HPS bulbs and stuff like

408
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,919
that so many amps are using for startups

409
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:08,959
so we have to turn different lights on

410
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:11,159
because we blow fuse boxes all the time

411
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:14,079
we used to have right well you know St

412
00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:16,919
Evol like the aach with this starting up

413
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:19,558
what is this oh um I'm just try it's

414
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:21,559
going to be roughly on sorry on I'm just

415
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:23,960
trying to think on one it's going to be

416
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:26,480
about 6.8 amps if it was running at full

417
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:28,079
power but you you never would run it

418
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,240
that's running at 240 it's going to

419
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:32,319
rough run about 3 and 1/2 amps if you're

420
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,240
running at sorry at 240 can you daisy

421
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:36,678
chain these up and control them with one

422
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,519
like single controller or you can you

423
00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:40,640
well you for you definitely can daisy

424
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:43,519
chain them they have an RJ45 Port so

425
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:46,080
that they connect and they also are um

426
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:47,839
we've actually just developed a new cord

427
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:50,519
so that you can actually daisy chain the

428
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:53,798
lights together so it's uh say here's

429
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:56,200
one option right here we got so basic

430
00:18:53,798 --> 00:18:57,759
yeah the these are RJ45 so they just go

431
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:00,120
so what's kind of cool is about with any

432
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:02,480
of our existing lights they have a rj14

433
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:05,038
port and when we were designing our

434
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,880
controller we wanted anybody it's going

435
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:08,240
to hook up to a troll Master it it is

436
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,440
compatible with a troll Master if you

437
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,880
want but it's also we designed it so our

438
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:14,320
controller so it can be used with any

439
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:16,080
existing lights that we've ever sold and

440
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:18,240
anybody else like we basically made it

441
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:19,678
so it can be compatible with any other

442
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,960
ones yeah we have dude what is your deal

443
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,880
trying to make [ __ ] compatible that's

444
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,919
not how the world Works everything's

445
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,400
supposed to be incompatible so it drives

446
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,120
you it's kind like an apple you can only

447
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,640
buy Apple at least things that work with

448
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:32,199
one another dude listen that's that's a

449
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,240
nice Vibe right off the bat because it

450
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:36,880
sort of shows like look we're not you

451
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:39,120
know let's just create

452
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,320
compatibility let's I'm look listen I'm

453
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:42,319
excited we're going to need to figure

454
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:43,960
out what we need to get to hang that

455
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:46,359
light cuz I'm sure there's something we

456
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:47,759
need things yeah yeah I'm going to turn

457
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:49,678
it off for a second but we'll be right

458
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:52,000
back all right just turn put it in some

459
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:54,360
ratchets here real quick this all comes

460
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,960
with the

461
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:59,240
light let's get the other one set up for

462
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,319
the other side

463
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,359
and then it's just a matter of putting

464
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:02,960
the other one on the other side that's

465
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:04,359
easy that makes like single person I

466
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,360
can't wait to see this thing light up

467
00:20:04,359 --> 00:20:08,599
dude that's going to be bright it's

468
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:10,959
going to be

469
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:13,119
bright I got to get some cannabis plants

470
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,919
in here well hopefully next week we can

471
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:16,798
get that going oh trust me dude I won't

472
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:18,360
be waiting much longer I got some seeds

473
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:20,839
for it I won't have

474
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:24,038
yeah I think life cycle botanics is

475
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:26,599
going to have some Cuts ready for us oh

476
00:20:24,038 --> 00:20:29,558
nice maybe get some de bub in here for

477
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:31,480
the first run ility guys and checked out

478
00:20:29,558 --> 00:20:33,480
that place it was awesome with been

479
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:35,880
doing at lifestyle Botanical it was it

480
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:37,000
was really sweet so that was a really

481
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,200
cool you want to come over here Johnny

482
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:43,640
and you can line this one up you can put

483
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:46,919
this one up here John oh no no

484
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:49,080
no so this is going to go right

485
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:50,520
there I know this on myself it's much

486
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:52,000
easier do with two people to be honest

487
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:53,558
yeah yeah for sure I'm enjoying this

488
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,519
although I definitely liked his style I

489
00:20:53,558 --> 00:20:57,480
could EAS do that myself together that

490
00:20:55,519 --> 00:21:00,119
was awesome yeah yeah yeah that was

491
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,120
awesome absolutely

492
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:03,919
now you just bring it up oh wait we're

493
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,280
got going to have to get the driver in

494
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,280
first well we're going to go right to

495
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:08,200
there oh yeah where you going to put the

496
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:09,918
driver up top right on there you know

497
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:12,480
what I think I think we can get it

498
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:13,480
higher without the driver so I'll just

499
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,360
send you an

500
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,798
extension wait we're going to just turn

501
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:17,959
it on though we'll just get it like

502
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:19,519
we'll mount it it like this just to get

503
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:22,200
it fire my God you could put the driver

504
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:26,359
on the roof of the

505
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:28,798
tent yeah I guess so look at that some

506
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:30,719
decent coverage that's the kind of

507
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:33,519
craziest looking tent LED light I've

508
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,278
ever seen actually well we actually have

509
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:38,720
a light that's designed for a tent

510
00:21:35,278 --> 00:21:40,960
called the Tren lent ultimate that's 56x

511
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,558
56 in that goes into the very Far

512
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,640
Corners that has a special diode

513
00:21:42,558 --> 00:21:46,678
configuration to have the most

514
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,120
uniformity or the best uniformity that

515
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:50,880
the world's ever seen nice but this is

516
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:52,519
more for Marcus to kind of play with

517
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,919
Spectrum tuning well that's what I'm

518
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:55,519
looking forward to looking to manipulate

519
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:57,559
see what I can find in the world of

520
00:21:55,519 --> 00:22:00,558
resin yeah you want to manipulate it to

521
00:21:57,558 --> 00:22:02,319
have it ooze more resin yeah absolutely

522
00:22:00,558 --> 00:22:04,678
and without question this is going to be

523
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:06,119
the best option sick well you know what

524
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:07,960
what I'm doing actually even at my own

525
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:09,239
place right now as I slept out like four

526
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,278
different lights talking about exactly

527
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:13,000
what you're doing right by seeing those

528
00:22:11,278 --> 00:22:14,319
light spects and how we're doing this

529
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,400
exactly what the future is being because

530
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:16,079
you can create your own spectrum and

531
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,278
take a look at how it's going to

532
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:19,918
produced for us I love it absolutely I'm

533
00:22:18,278 --> 00:22:21,319
excited well let's get an extension cord

534
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,360
and plug this in just to see perfect

535
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:23,918
what's going to take a second you might

536
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:26,278
as well just stop push-ups Johnny B's

537
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:28,720
alarm just went off oh [ __ ] sorry man

in and then we're going to have to get a

580
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:20,400
extension on call we have

581
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:20,399
to locate

582
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:29,519
it

583
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:32,839

interesting getting this

585
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:37,599
done oh yeah let's get the should we

586
00:24:35,798 --> 00:24:38,639
hang it with the other cords first you

587
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:39,319
know what I mean and then we'll here's

588

the

589
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:43,480
manual for the

590
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:46,519
Borg and it goes through and shows

591
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:49,360
there's pages and pages and pages of

592
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:51,278
light frequency spectrums you can see

593
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:55,959
this is the double blue he was talking

594
00:24:51,278 --> 00:25:00,240
about you talk about the far red 730

595
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:04,240
nanometer it's a whole [ __ ] ton of

596
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:06,079
presets whole [ __ ] ton of presets

597
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,919
interesting I'm like I've never been

598
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:09,000
more stoked to light up a light I I can

599
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:11,360
say

600
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,519
that all right we got this light and

601
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:16,319
Driver mounted it was pretty easy mostly

602
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:18,000
all done on camera just need four people

603
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:20,038
to lift it up that's it all we needed

604
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,919
was four people to four people that's it

605
00:25:20,038 --> 00:25:23,960
or three disabled people where the their

606
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:26,000
fourth person I missed that oh you're

607
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:28,919
two people Johnny there

608
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,398
you okay

609
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:33,440
so then we're going to need another plug

610
00:25:30,398 --> 00:25:34,199
for the there we go ah oh what do you

611
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,480
got

612
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:40,240
there so we can control them all we so

613
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:42,200
we can first start by controlling the so

614
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:46,159
that's the 9000k

615
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:48,480
channelo this crazy insanely blue damn

616
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:52,880
Bluer Than any light has ever been able

617
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:55,120
to go and a commercial fixture yeah and

618
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,240
then okay so here is the warm white

619
00:25:55,119 --> 00:26:00,158
Channel this warm white it looks very

620
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:04,000
similar to what HPS is yeah it does

621
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:06,679
except for HPS also has um 730 nmet in

622
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,480
it so now this is our 660 nmet this is

623
00:26:06,679 --> 00:26:11,000
really hard on the

624
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:14,798
eyes oh

625
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,880
man without glasses it's I know it's

626
00:26:14,798 --> 00:26:18,679
it's really blinding oh my God it is

627
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,640
terrible and Johnny B's got his light

628
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:22,559
meter out and he's doing some

629
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:26,679
measurements all

630
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:28,519
R oh it's 419 one minute warning you

631
00:26:26,679 --> 00:26:30,080
know more what on so that's an all Red

632
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:31,440
Spectrum so there you guys go there you

633
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:33,639
can take a look what's going on here

634
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,880
what he's talking about and I'll add the

635
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:38,038
far red to that actually the far red now

636
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:39,559
so well with with that with I'm I'm

637
00:26:38,038 --> 00:26:42,558
going to redo it again there's the far

638
00:26:39,558 --> 00:26:44,519
red so you can see added the 730 so you

639
00:26:42,558 --> 00:26:47,398
dump that in there so you can we can

640
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:49,599
have fun here guys now let's add the

641
00:26:47,398 --> 00:26:52,079
warm white to it okay now we're going do

642
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:53,558
sorry this is the it feels like warm

643
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:56,000
white because that was so red even

644
00:26:53,558 --> 00:26:58,759
though it says command has been finished

645
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,480
yet so now you can see the coming up

646
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:01,798
doesn't it really show up on my camera

647
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,798
I'm surprised that more doesn't come up

648
00:27:01,798 --> 00:27:06,599
there is that is that what what's on

649
00:27:03,798 --> 00:27:08,798
right now right now I'll do it one more

650
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:11,278
time is it if you hold it at different

651
00:27:08,798 --> 00:27:13,278
angles will it change no no that's what

652
00:27:11,278 --> 00:27:15,919
you have there right now

653
00:27:13,278 --> 00:27:16,919
okay and then let's uh it's weird it

654
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:18,559
just doesn't want to show up on the

655
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:20,679
camera it's just black now let's see

656
00:27:18,558 --> 00:27:23,960
what happens if you put it all

657
00:27:20,679 --> 00:27:23,960
on cuz it's

658
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:29,519
420

659
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:39,439
oh look at all the green Jesus wow I

660
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:41,600
just wish that I could see it better

661
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:44,000
it's so weird now yeah I have to zoom in

662
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:49,199
so far to see the light meter there we

663
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:51,278
go it's got that double blue far red big

664
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,519
green wellow yeah we could have a lot of

665
00:27:51,278 --> 00:27:56,519
fun with this guys get better if I look

666
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:59,200
at it this one

667
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:00,480
mhm so really manipulating in all

668
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,919
different light spects and here's what

669
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,720
we're really seeing here guys so now you

670
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:07,759
can see this go down just where go there

671
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:09,679
and L check this out so he just all red

672
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:12,158
so yeah this is just the far red just

673
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:14,240
far red that's pretty cool to see and

674
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:18,278
doing that on the Fly I give me some old

675
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:19,679
blue 731 nanometers okay so now I'm

676
00:28:18,278 --> 00:28:21,398
going to go check out over here it come

677
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:24,679
over

678
00:28:21,398 --> 00:28:27,599
here see see the spike of blue oh I see

679
00:28:24,679 --> 00:28:29,038
it all right so that's going to be for

680
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:30,918
sping and what we're looking at we can

681
00:28:29,038 --> 00:28:32,960
talk there's lots we can talk about all

682
00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:34,880
kinds of things I mean if we would have

683
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,319
had light like this back in like when we

684
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,679
were trying to using all these and

685
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:40,319
stuffers we were growing in 2ot 3ot

686
00:28:38,679 --> 00:28:42,720
areas so you had to get certain you can

687
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:46,439
use light to manipulate plant this is

688
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:48,798
what's so beautiful of what so excited I

689
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:50,720
I'd be so excited I would yeah this is

690
00:28:48,798 --> 00:28:53,679
like just how

691
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:55,880
much can you just imagine for like the

692
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:57,720
first 20 years of my growing if you have

693
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:59,600
an issue you walk you open open the door

694
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:01,440
and you're hit with a heat wave cuz you

695
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:03,519
didn't know you had a failure look at

696
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,759
that look at that that's that's all blue

697
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:08,159
with tiny bit of red so understanding

698
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:09,599
you can have so much fun and look at PL

699
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:12,600
and once you start understanding what

700
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:14,119
the different you know spectrums have to

701
00:29:12,599 --> 00:29:17,000
offer what

702
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:20,319
the learning proc then it's an endless

703
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:22,759
amount we literally have to just test

704
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:24,639
and of R&amp;D and are you are you testing

705
00:29:22,759 --> 00:29:26,679
for how well it grows the Cannabis are

706
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:29,519
you are you testing how well it grows

707
00:29:26,679 --> 00:29:30,960
resin or are you yeah how about your

708
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:33,359
fruits and veg are you testing to keep

709
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,679
your plant shorter are you trying to Str

710
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:36,918
make your plants stretch keep your

711
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:38,559
plants shorter it's it's pretty much R

712
00:29:36,919 --> 00:29:40,519
can actually stretch it with far red so

713
00:29:38,558 --> 00:29:43,599
you longate stem create Leaf expansion

714
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:45,079
we're this is all it's pretty exciting

715
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:47,879
it's exciting cuz when I was in like in

716
00:29:45,079 --> 00:29:49,319
Mexico I went to I went to when I was in

717
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,679
I took my light meter all over the world

718
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:53,079
so I've seen all different cool

719
00:29:50,679 --> 00:29:54,880
spectrums and understanding yeah so this

720
00:29:53,079 --> 00:29:56,879
is and then going be a lot of fun this

721
00:29:54,880 --> 00:30:00,640
is yeah this is a lot of fun dude it's

722
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:02,640
awesome Borg the Borg tarantula yeah I I

723
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,278
appreciate it I really appreciate what

724
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,000

00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,640
rigged for now we're going to get this

747
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:54,319
we're going to get this light set up

748
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,919
properly eventually all the extension

749
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:57,720
cords all of this stuff will be kind of

750
00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:00,278
out of the way but this is is just the

751
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:01,880
beginning of getting a couple of 5x5 I

752
00:31:00,278 --> 00:31:04,000
don't even have enough extension cords

753
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:06,278
so that's why this one's dark while this

754
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,638
one's light but we lit them both up

755
00:31:06,278 --> 00:31:09,519
everything's working the drivers are

756
00:31:07,638 --> 00:31:11,798
working on both of them sitting here and

757
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:14,319
get askk in the Sun going to get some

758
00:31:11,798 --> 00:31:16,679
cannabis plants in here the heat in the

759
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:18,759
very near future what do you mean you

760

can Envision it plants growing this put

761
00:31:18,759 --> 00:31:23,960
a string system in here do like she put

762
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:25,519
a scrog system in your form make it

763
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:27,200
really nice get single top coals with

764
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:28,240
this make it really nice and a scrog it

765
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,319
you know what I think I'm just going to

766
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,480
play around I'm just going to play

767
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:34,798
around going to have a good time these

768
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:37,120
tents are cly I'm staying here they they

769
00:31:34,798 --> 00:31:38,918
have these clips that you can clip on

770
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:40,398
for hooking up to tents I just first

771
00:31:38,919 --> 00:31:41,960
time I ever saw them recently they're

772
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:43,599
kind of sick so that just have

773
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:45,840
everything grow right through he's going

774
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:48,199
to have it running with a grow link

775
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:49,879
sensor so like everything is completely

776
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:51,319
automatic and we're going to be having

777
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:53,278
them as a guest to talk about it and

778
00:31:51,319 --> 00:31:55,480
it's mindblowing like I don't I can't

779
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:58,119
represent what it can really do it's

780
00:31:55,480 --> 00:32:01,240
just so cool it's they've got they've

781
00:31:58,119 --> 00:32:03,119
got Incorporated AI into their system

782
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:05,399
and thought of every last possible thing

783
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:07,638
that it could do so beautiful well

784

sayara here peace to Johnny B who

786
00:32:09,798 --> 00:32:13,558
brought his light meter thank you so

787
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:16,079
much D it's cool to see that Thomas from
