hey good morning guys it is the next day

3
00:00:22,649 --> 00:00:30,028
here in Majorca we just woke up in a

4
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:33,359
beautiful apartment that was supplied to

5
00:00:30,028 --> 00:00:35,820
us by Dani and grace our most amazing

6
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:39,619
hosts who took such good care of us how

7
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:45,000
good did they take care of us last night

8
00:00:39,619 --> 00:00:49,049
right so we've got this little apartment

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,590
here it's pretty sweet here's the little

10
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:55,738
Town Hall across the street there a

11
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:59,160
little the police station right across

12
00:00:55,738 --> 00:01:00,689
the street and it was the little town

13
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:03,448
right here we're gonna probably take a

14
00:01:00,689 --> 00:01:06,140
walk down to the beach which is

15
00:01:03,448 --> 00:01:09,569
apparently only a couple blocks from our

16
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:10,739
little apartment here right now so yeah

17
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:13,139
we're gonna make a little bit of hash

18
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:15,780
today and do a little bit of rosin as

19
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:18,210
well we got to go help Dani and grab the

20
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,310
rosin press apparently it weighs damn

21
00:01:18,209 --> 00:01:22,530
near a ton and he can't do it by himself

22
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:24,509
so we're happy to go and help him do

23
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,560
that and in the meantime I think we're

24
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:27,900

25
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:31,460

minutes

57
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:26,650
doing a little work down here it sounds

58
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:26,650
like Mediterranean

59
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:37,668
