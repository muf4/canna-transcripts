00:01:35,078 --> 00:01:38,559
had a hash Church you know there's been

33
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,320
so much going on in the world right now

oh and s's going to melt some hash you

know the first time I saw s do that was

36
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:51,320
probably a very very long time ago I

37
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:54,039
think 2001 or 2002 I'm telling you dude

38
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:56,398
because I picture that Jason Lee bubbler

39
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:59,079
that you bought from me in the

40
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:02,079
background as you're doing it I have it

41
00:01:59,078 --> 00:02:03,919
I have it right where I am now I think

42
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:07,919
of course of course you

43
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,399
do that's awesome well yeah lots going

44
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,080
on in the world I thought it would be a

45
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:13,560
kind of a good idea to have a little

46
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:15,879
gathering of hash Church alumni here

47
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,719
maybe some new maybe some old and just

48
00:02:15,878 --> 00:02:21,239
kind of get together not with any really

49
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:23,318

50
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:25,159

55
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:36,000

56
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,519
same time I want to hear exactly what

57
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,800
everyone's kind of going through these

58
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:42,560

60
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,120
did you get to check out London and

61
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:50,560
Germany and Berlin oh I saw that one in

62
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:53,480
London how many people was that not as

63
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,479
many as in Germany really I didn't see

64
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:57,719
Germany but I saw London it looked like

65
00:02:55,479 --> 00:03:00,119
Germany like I just put some pictures up

66
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:03,158
on my Facebook like Germany was

67
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,480
outrageous you know wow well I thought

68
00:03:03,158 --> 00:03:06,878
the picture of London was pretty

69
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:08,439
outrageous so Germany really must have

70
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:12,000
been outrageous it looked like over a

71
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:14,479
100,000 people in London and and over a

72
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,120
million in Germany

73
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:19,439
damn well people are out protesting and

74
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,080
here we are just puffing we got a couple

75
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:23,158
hundred people watching in the room

76
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:26,680
right now puffing is one of the best

77
00:03:23,158 --> 00:03:29,239
things you can do straight

78
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:31,040
up straight up I agree you know

79
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:33,480
obviously we're all quite biased and

80
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:35,438
we've been saying this for a long time

81
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:38,000
but when you hear mainstream media

82
00:03:35,438 --> 00:03:41,158
people when you when you hear Dr Bonnie

83
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,158
Henry who's our health lady here in BC

84
00:03:41,158 --> 00:03:45,959
say you know just like uh you know stay

85
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:48,479
at home with friends and smoke some

86
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:50,560
joints and I was like excuse me did she

87
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:53,238
just say to to hang out with friends and

88
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,158
smoke joints did she say smoke joints

89
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:57,079
really yeah she was talking about like

90
00:03:55,158 --> 00:03:59,120
puffing yeah I mean it's you know we're

91
00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:03,079
allowed to smoke joints now so why not

92
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,560
right I like that yeah it's it's it's at

93
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:06,560
the point right now that every time I go

94
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,039
out and I roll a joint I actually I got

95
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,318
like four or five in front of me soon as

96
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:10,919
when I light up a joint with some

97
00:04:09,318 --> 00:04:13,679
friends I just hand them one now because

98
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:16,159
it's you just can't share anymore it's

99
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,000
it's like that puff and pass is RO one

100
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,919
for your friend H you know it's the

101
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,759
Jamaican way to be honest the Jamaicans

102
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:24,279
taught me that so many years ago they

103
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,960
were just like well why you want to pass

104
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:28,279
your joint around like why don't you

105
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:30,959
just roll your own spliff and I was like

106
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:34,119
man I never even thought of such a thing

107
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:35,519
and same reason what you know why

108
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,800
because we always want to share

109
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:40,959
something we're like here you

110
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:43,360
let joint first you want to do is such a

111
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:45,439
big part of it

112
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,960
man

113
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:52,399
well I think the bigger reason was in

114
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:55,799
America a Jo used to be

115
00:04:52,399 --> 00:05:00,239
expensive now it's I mean in Jamaica

116
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:02,840
it's cheap so why share

117
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,720
I recognize that

118
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:07,478
voice yeah you

119
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:10,440

[ __ ] is funny not not now in

144

145
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:28,560
man to acknowledge that that [ __ ]

146
00:06:26,598 --> 00:06:32,519
happened I mean it was classic it's

147
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:34,959
amazing no never ever happened to

148
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:37,639
me it's it's just you know what it

149
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:41,439
really is the story that sort of leads

150
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:43,918
into um oh what the heck is his name now

151
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:46,478
karma karma genetics has a cultiv called

152
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:47,959
where is my bike and everyone's like

153
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:51,038
what the [ __ ] is that it's like it was

154
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:53,399
the Amnesia Haze crossed with that biker

155
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:55,360
cush and it was like I think one of the

156
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:58,279
first guys to ever smoke it basically

157
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:01,000
came back and was like I lost my bike

158
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:02,279
which is not really most like lots of

159
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,199
people have lost their bikes in

160
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:06,198
Amsterdam particularly people who go

161
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:08,319
there who rent a bike and have never

162
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:10,079
been there and the place all looks the

163
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,879
same and you park your bike out in front

164
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:13,318
of a little spot and the next thing you

165
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:15,280
know you're walking around you get

166
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:17,360
separated from your bike that bike's

167
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:19,679
gone if you're never ever gonna see

168
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,960
especially if you don't lock it

169
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,560
especially if you don't lock it exactly

170
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:26,878
there's no doubt about that but doing it

171
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:31,519
with a car is like the next like the

172
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:31,520
next level that's

173
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:37,519
I yeah oh my goodness no no one even got

174
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:39,758
a new car out of it well yeah you're

175
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:42,639
right actually some omita says someone

176
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,120
got a new car out of it it's true you're

177
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,759
right you're right you're right without

178
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,519
even knowing the story you're right

179
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:51,598
that's funny all right I'm loading up

180
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:54,439
some lime pop 87 little bit of rosin

181
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:57,319
that I squished with Flav the other

182
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:59,918
day anybody else using tons of Edibles

183
00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:02,000
during this whole Co thing that's my my

184
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:05,120
god I've been I've been doing Edibles

185
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,519
almost every other day almost every

186
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,079
other day I last night I went to I went

187
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:12,478
to the sauna and I ate a bunch of

188
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:16,198
Edibles I got in the hot tub I did a few

189
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:18,079
sweats on the Edibles and like I'm not

190
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:20,199
on my phone when I'm in the sauna and

191
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:24,000
I'm not talking that much I'm mostly

192
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:25,960
like internalizing and it was fantastic

193
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,439
eating Edibles at the sun I highly

194
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:29,439
recommend it

195
00:08:30,038 --> 00:08:33,559
I've been just puffing a lot not so much

196
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,680
eating

197
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:37,759
Edibles uh mainly because I'm working in

198
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:39,239
the lab five days a week so I can't just

199
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:42,599
get utterly

200
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:44,799
destroyed and and still operate multiple

201
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:47,920
lab technicians and multiple modalities

202
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:49,639
of extraction and all highly regulated

203
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:52,519
QA and all this other stuff that you

204
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:54,278
have to sort of deal with but um puffing

205
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:56,560
has certainly been my friend there's no

206
00:08:54,278 --> 00:08:58,240
doubt about that well that's probably

207
00:08:56,559 --> 00:09:01,599
why because you do you guys hear my shop

208
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:04,240
got looted and robbed and cl horrible

209
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,959
horrible horrible I actually see it in

210
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:09,759
your face I see that I see that

211
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:12,439
disappointment in your face and usually

212
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:15,480
usually usually I never see that in your

213
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:18,680
face your face is like optimistic like

214
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:21,560
you know inspiring and it still is but I

215
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:25,399
see now I know that look I saw on your

216
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:28,159
face oh God so about but I forgot about

217
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:30,240
that that happened to you and that sucks

218
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:31,399
that's what happens we're still close so

219
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,000
yeah maybe that's why I'm eating the

220
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:35,120
Edibles right you just got to like shut

221
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,480
down that thought process that happens

222
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,360
you know when something really bad like

223
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,600
that little traum been dealing Trauma

224
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,639
from it you know because it was bad you

225
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,480
guys all all 10 dispensaries in Oakland

226
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:47,600
got targeted by looters and robbers like

227
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:50,800
every one of us and the majority of us

228
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,759
lost everything we lost everything our

229
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:54,679
our security cameras our doors our

230
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:56,919
Windows our all of our weed all of our

231
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:58,278
money all of our equipment so I mean

232
00:09:56,919 --> 00:10:01,120
because the Oakland Police Department I

233
00:09:58,278 --> 00:10:03,120
don't blame the Rock per se I blame

234
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,440
societal issues of course being so bad

235
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,360
but also Oakland Police Department

236
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:08,800
didn't help us at all they actually left

237
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:11,159
our place unguarded for eight hours what

238
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:12,599
the hell these guys were able to get a

239
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:14,600
thousand pound safe out of there in that

240
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:17,159
course of that eight hours

241
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,920
so that's that's some [ __ ] for sure

242
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:20,480
I remember back in the day when someone

243
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:22,559
drove a car through the front of the

244
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,440
Compassion Club which would actually

245
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:26,719
later end up leading to me getting

246
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:28,519
busted with Compassion Club cannabis

247
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,278
because they didn't want to keep it at

248
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:32,639
the facility because they were getting

249
00:10:30,278 --> 00:10:34,320
robbed well these guys drive a car

250
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:35,679
through the fac right through the window

251
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:40,040
this is in the

252
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:41,719
90s late '90s they get this the safe had

253
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:43,679
to be close to a th000 pounds as well it

254
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:46,920
was ridiculous how far they moved it

255
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:50,078
scraped up the floor bent the door so it

256
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:52,679
was just somehow cracked the tiniest bit

257
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:56,120
well it had like 35 pounds of Renee in

258
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:57,519
the safe so this little crack was like

259
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,919
you might as well have had a thousand

260
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:02,799
light grow in full bloom inside that

261
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:04,919
safe it stunk so bad the cops showed up

262
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:07,719
and Hillary was certain like oh this is

263
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:11,039
not going to go well and they guarded

264
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:13,639
that safe for like hours just standing

265
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:14,799
next to the safe not doing much it's not

266
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:17,278
like they were standing there with their

267
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:20,039
guns out they just were a presence and I

268
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:22,000
mean how hard is that for the police

269
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:23,919
department to be doing I mean in my

270
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,278
opinion that would be probably one of

271
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:28,078
the safest places to be just go hang out

272
00:11:26,278 --> 00:11:29,639
next to this safe you know you got your

273
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:31,879
cop car there no one's going to come and

274
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:33,799
bother you I'm really sorry that

275
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:35,399
happened to you and and all the rest of

276
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:36,919
the and everyone millions and millions

277
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:39,399
of dollars some of my friends lost $2

278
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:41,278
million doar like above you know

279
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:43,639
millions of dollars in their facilities

280
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:45,120
but um after that the police felt so bad

281
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:46,799
they have stepped up a little bit at

282
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,480
least to be preventative and one of the

283
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:49,919
weirder conversations I've ever had with

284
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,959
the police which I've had a lot at this

285
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:54,199
point but yeah the captain of the police

286
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:55,799
department's like how about next time

287
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:58,278
we'll guard it just bring it all down to

288
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:59,559
the police department and we'll and

289
00:11:58,278 --> 00:12:01,159
we'll we'll sort it at the Police

290
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:03,719
Department during the civil unrest and

291
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:05,519
then people oh my God is this really

292
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:08,160
happening the police tell me to bring my

293
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:10,278
weed down so they'll put it I thought

294
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:13,600
the police I thought the police always

295
00:12:10,278 --> 00:12:16,039
said crime doesn't

296
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,040
pay yeah that's their motto that's why

297
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:22,319
people don't trust them it's like man

298
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:24,919
like even your motto's way off

299
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:28,920
like it's terrible I know I know you're

300
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:28,919
not going to smoke us B

301
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:33,000
you better smoke

302
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:34,039
one Sam when's the last time you smoked

303
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,278
a spliff

304
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:41,480
Sam the last time I had either uh women

305
00:12:38,278 --> 00:12:41,480
or slaves at my

306
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:48,039
house he went there only Sam you have to

307
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,000
know the context of that without

308
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:53,000
thinking Sam's a total douche right now

309
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,240
and I can promise you he's not but that

310
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,799
was borderline over the over the over

311
00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:03,799
the top I haven't smoked a joint in 19

312
00:12:57,799 --> 00:13:06,120
years myself you haven't no oh I know

313

actually yeah I wish I wish I could I

316
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,720

317
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:20,439
know it has to be great weed yeah it has

318
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,560
to be great weed for sure but something

319
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:25,880
happened s after I got turned on to

320
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:28,039
bubble and I was making bubble in 99 and

321
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:31,240
I was getting Renee and it was so

322
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:34,360
flavorful it almost blasted out my my

323
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:36,480
nose and my taste buds with this Renee

324
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:39,039
profile and for two and a half years I

325
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,000
smoked that [ __ ] chronic every day and

326
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:43,519
then someone was like Hey like uh this

327
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,519
is a really it was a super nice joint in

328
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:48,039
Jamaica of like Lamb's bread they're

329
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:49,679
like you got to smoke this it's so nice

330
00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:51,639
and I was like all right and I just took

331
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:55,000
a little little puff of it and it just

332
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:57,519
tasted like like an ashtray it was just

333
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:01,078
like it was wet on the end and it was

334
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:04,078
like I don't know just I was like I've

335
00:14:01,078 --> 00:14:06,198
ruined joints for myself which was

336
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:08,879
really actually quite a sad day I wasn't

337
00:14:06,198 --> 00:14:10,799
stoked about it at all it was like I

338
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:14,360
couldn't get back to the perspective

339
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:17,679
because I like many of you absolutely

340
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:21,399
loved joints like I would look at it the

341
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:23,719
way s's looking at his yeah 53 years at

342
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:26,958
doing this yeah exactly dude and I was

343
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:29,959
only like 20 some odd or 15 years in or

344
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:32,638
something you know like I wasn't

345
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:35,719
so I get it I wish I could go back and

346
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,720
enjoy it but I

347
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,198
can't on the commercial Market but it's

348
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:45,919
nowhere you know you can't get that

349
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:50,120
stuff at least I'm trying I know Marcus

350
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:51,958
is trying too oh yeah it's a lot of but

351
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:54,799
I think some of the newer varieties are

352
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:56,518
really tasty Marcus and I I I would say

353
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:58,639
that some of the newer stuff I've been

354
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:00,320
smoking on these these really expansive

355
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:03,079
poly Hy hybrids that have just been

356
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:05,519
super worked I mean the tpping profiles

357
00:15:03,078 --> 00:15:09,719
on some of them are really exent I love

358
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:12,440
them I love them in in in pure form

359
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:16,320
diluted on plant matter and wrapped in

360
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:18,199
paper and glue not so much I'm with you

361

interesting I I as you know I'm not huge

363
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:26,078
on joints at all and I yeah I mean I

364
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:29,799
didn't smoke the whole thing but like

365

you breaking up that 26 week sativa at

397
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:59,559
uh I think David's from uh Ripper seeds

398
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:02,360
we were making hash there and you were

399
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:05,198
in the back room in Barcelona yeah I

400
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:06,919
remember yeah that was uh it's funny

401
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,000
because there's a video of that on my

402
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:11,240
Channel all these different stories

403
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,240
often that I talk about I'll be like

404
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:16,400
whoa there's actually a video of that on

405
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,240
on this on this YouTube channel it's

406
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:22,160
it's pretty

407
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:25,199
trippy have the video of the

408
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,959
experience 26 week Haze was the longest

409
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:29,320
I'd ever heard flowering I used to grow

410
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:32,640
one back in the day that was about 16

411
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:35,439
weeks um that we thought was long you

412
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:38,480
know even that's long these days it's

413
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:40,679
long but that uh that 26 weer that you

414
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:43,720
had was

415
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:47,240
uh ridiculous that should be available

416
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:51,400
too I had one that went till under

417
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:55,720
natural photo period in h Central Coast

418
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:59,200
California it went until April the 1 and

419
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:01,120
I called it April pools phas

420
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,319
it was planted you know like in

421
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:05,519
September or something like that but it

422
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:10,480
just took forever to

423
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:12,440
flower damn damn that's insane I got a

424
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,360
plant that I'm running right now so I'm

425
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:17,480
in like week six of flower and it's just

426
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:19,918
starting to get buzs I'm like [ __ ] this

427
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:21,240
thing is gonna go probably that 16 weeks

428
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:24,280
because it is

429
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:27,200
across Colombian uh 24 weeks of T

430
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:29,000
Colombia with grco cookies and it's just

431
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,360
like you can tell it's like oh it's

432
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,279
going to go that

433
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:38,759
long and

434
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:42,720
look what photo period do you put it on

435
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:45,119
J right now I'm on 11 and a half hours a

436
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,240
day uh because I'm trying to match my

437
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:50,199
ppfd to get the right moles a day so

438
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:54,400
I've got 30 moles a day at

439
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:56,840
756 ppfd at my canopy but I had a major

440
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:59,320
pH problem I was feeding at 4.5 so I'm

441
00:18:56,839 --> 00:19:01,759
TR of recovering from that if I can

442
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:04,678
for like two

443
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:05,960
weeks was that low for two weeks yeah I

444
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:08,720
thought it was light stress in the

445
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:13,400
beginning and it was like stress I was

446
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:17,558
hitting them at like um 1500 ppfd 1256

447
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:19,960
to 1500 at 18 hours a day so when I went

448
00:19:17,558 --> 00:19:22,240
into flower things changed I started

449
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:24,319
seeing light stress and then through

450
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:30,319
that my meter started failing that went

451
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:32,240
into PPM to a new scen lock out to well

452
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:33,879
these sativas now that are now they're

453
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,519
recovering the other ones probably won't

454
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:37,840
but I'm gonna I'm actually being able to

455
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:39,720
see these longer flowering plants

456
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:41,639
hopefully we'll recover from and be able

457
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,360
to see what they I get from them but the

458
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:47,919
phot period right now we think sound

459
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:50,798
11.5 hours at um like I said I'm at

460
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:54,559
750 ppfd at the top of the canopy so

461
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:54,558
that gives me 30 moles a day I

462
00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:00,519
think

463
00:19:56,279 --> 00:20:02,798
and because you can usually speed up uh

464
00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:05,879
flowering or shorten flowering depending

465
00:20:02,798 --> 00:20:09,879
on what you want to call it by uh not

466
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:13,000
doing 122 but doing you know 11 hours of

467
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:16,760
light a day or but

468
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,038
whatever that's I'm also introducing the

469
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:21,240
so the plants feel like they're in the

470
00:20:18,038 --> 00:20:21,240
shade so hopefully that

471
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:28,159
might I liked how Johnny B went deep on

472
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:30,279

00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:11,320
that pH low 4.5 like really showing

490
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,480
people because it looked like it was

491
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:15,439
nutrient burn and I thought it was a a

492
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:17,319
nitrogen burn and then I thought it was

493
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,440
light stress and there was so many and

494
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:21,519
I'm testing my meters like crazy I

495
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,278
actually went to Blue lab and then one

496
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:24,599
guy I brought in he goes your meter's

497
00:21:23,278 --> 00:21:26,159
eight years old dude he goes you're only

498
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:28,119
good for two years your meter's dead I'm

499
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:31,240
like well why does this stuff last

500
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:33,759
forever these days but that was a huge

501
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:36,919
lesson for me was was really I have

502
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:38,839
three uh not double triple checking my

503
00:21:36,919 --> 00:21:41,679
my calibrations and actually not

504
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:44,319
comparing with another pen so having two

505
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,840
is is now I'll always have a second pen

506
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:48,918
to double check with things because I

507
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:50,319
relied on one meter for so long well I

508
00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:53,000
appreciate your honesty your

509
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:55,599
transparency and your courage in a time

510
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,960
when so many people are so afraid to

511
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:59,278
show any vulnerability or weakness on

512
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:01,400
social media

513
00:21:59,278 --> 00:22:04,720
here you are just blasting it out to the

514
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:06,600
world oh I [ __ ] got bugs oh I I I

515
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:09,038
[ __ ] up my plants I did this and what

516
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:11,038
you're doing is you're making the

517
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:13,839
mistakes that they're all afraid to

518
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:15,158
either talk about or share or show and

519
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:17,000
you're doing it in a way that are

520
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:18,400
allowing people to be like oh [ __ ] maybe

521
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,640
that's what happened to my plants you

522
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:23,080
know because people are the internet is

523
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,320
horrendous it's like uh it's you know

524
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:26,119
you go on there and all of a sudden

525
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:29,079
you're under full attack like if you

526
00:22:26,119 --> 00:22:31,278
just posted if it wasn't you posting

527
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:33,000
that picture and it was anyone else you

528
00:22:31,278 --> 00:22:35,038
know they would just be like fully

529
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,240
destroyed on social media look at this

530
00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:39,079
Noob like people are not as willing to

531
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:41,839
help so I do really appreciate your

532
00:22:39,079 --> 00:22:44,678
ability to share your mistakes with

533
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:46,720
everyone and get past them and show how

534
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:48,600
you can continue to grow healthy plants

535
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,079
it's it's pretty cool

536
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:53,678
man you know what it's the plant that

537
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:56,720
always teaches me to grow forward and

538
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:59,080
and it's showing me uh like I have that

539
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,798
amazing cany like with the room was

540
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:02,278
doing so well and I was so proud of it

541
00:23:00,798 --> 00:23:04,599
and it's just like it just kind of like

542
00:23:02,278 --> 00:23:07,359
at any second you can that's how quick

543
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:09,480
you can lose a crop and people really I

544
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:11,119
mean I I've never had this problem

545
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,319
before and it it went through everything

546
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:13,519
so it's good to be able to share with

547
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:16,079
people at the same time people are

548
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:17,839
teaching me so much so as I'm sharing

549
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:19,359
I'm learning so much coming back because

550
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:22,278
now everybody's like oh try this hey

551
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:23,839
your pH got to be 6.6 these the lights

552
00:23:22,278 --> 00:23:25,079
are are more like Ferraris you're gonna

553
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:26,599
have to tune up your engine you're going

554
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:28,558
to need to add a little bit more of this

555
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:30,079
and change your like there's a few

556
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:32,200
different things that I'm learning going

557
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:35,119
into this new phase of the next level

558
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:38,278
growing with VPD with LEDs with looking

559
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:39,719
at those canopies looking at the ppfd

560
00:23:38,278 --> 00:23:41,759
look at the amount of moles the plants

561
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,880
are getting a day and really dialing

562
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:46,079
that in like right now I'm learning that

563
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:47,760
with LEDs like I can come in at the end

564
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:49,558
the last couple weeks of my flowering

565
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:50,599
add a far red the plants feel like

566
00:23:49,558 --> 00:23:53,119
they're in the shade they're going to

567
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:54,798
actually just elongate more get bigger

568
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:57,759
Buds and that's just the research that's

569
00:23:54,798 --> 00:23:59,759
coming out of uh Apple D Technologies

570
00:23:57,759 --> 00:24:01,640
which is through grinby from and this is

571
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:03,839
all NASA research right now so it's

572
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:05,240
pretty cool to see how the Direction

573
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:07,079
with LED growing because I've been

574
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:08,839
growing with LEDs for so long to see

575
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:10,240
it's next step in the future of growing

576
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:12,480
and I always say this green Rush right

577
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,278
now is LED lights for cannabis that is

578
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,839
the biggest green Rush right now for the

579
00:24:14,278 --> 00:24:19,159
industry is LED lights because there's

580
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:21,119
so many lights on the market now before

581
00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:24,200
you just go and buy an HBS bul or a dual

582
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:26,278
land gabita there's H there's so many

583
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:28,840
LED lights on the market guys now it's

584
00:24:26,278 --> 00:24:30,919
it's it's overwhelming what light what

585
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:33,199
like not to choose which ones work for

586
00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:36,360
what applications we got ones for veg

587
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,880
ones for flow ones for late flow like

588
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:40,199
it's pretty cool to see how we're able

589
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:43,799
to dial this in now and I've been down

590
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:45,880
the rabbit hole huge learning about ppfd

591
00:24:43,798 --> 00:24:47,319
uh photo synthetic flux density and the

592
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,799
amount of photons that leaving the light

593
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:51,000
source and the amount of actually

594
00:24:48,798 --> 00:24:52,759
hitting the leaf and there's just so

595
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,679
much more to know and and it's pretty

596
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:56,640
cool you know I always love sharing this

597
00:24:54,679 --> 00:24:58,440
with you guys because I I kind of want

598
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,080
you guys to share back so hit me up and

599
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:03,159
let's talk about growing you know what I

600
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:06,199
mean that's what I love so much bong rip

601
00:25:03,159 --> 00:25:09,159
have to say dabs away bong rip indeed

602
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:10,798
that was uh that was awesome dude I'm uh

603
00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:13,960
I'm always stoked I was stoked when you

604
00:25:10,798 --> 00:25:15,918
got into the the the active water that

605
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:17,519
was unique and different not a lot of

606
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:20,799
people were were doing it and of course

607
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:23,440
tons of people are are are light experts

608
00:25:20,798 --> 00:25:25,720
and whatnot but you're you're honest and

609
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:28,038
trustworthy I think that's like your

610
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:29,640
your how you differ from a lot of these

611
00:25:28,038 --> 00:25:32,359
different from people you're actually

612
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:34,159
trustworthy you're not uh out to uh

613
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:36,879
direct people in the wrong in the wrong

614
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:38,520
way so cheers Johnny B and cheers

615
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,880
everyone else on the panel right now I

616
00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:42,079
really appreciate you all showing up

617
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:44,679
here today for a little hash Church

618
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:45,599
something we haven't really done in a

619
00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:48,120
long

620
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:49,599
time hey me and Colin have a project

621
00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:53,038
we're working on

622
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:55,839
together tell us after meeting on H

623
00:25:53,038 --> 00:25:58,640
church because um well you guys know

624
00:25:55,839 --> 00:26:00,319
that Magnolia has a dab bar so and there

625
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,399
I was dabbing probably last time I was

626
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:03,879
on hash church and and Co was just

627
00:26:02,398 --> 00:26:05,239
heating up and I'm looking at the rig

628
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:07,360
going and I think we even talked about

629
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:09,919
it how do we clean those things so that

630
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:11,240
we can use them in a public space and I

631
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:12,840
could use it and then it could be

632
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:14,519
cleaned and somebody else could use it

633
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:17,839
like how do you actually flip the glass

634
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:20,038
wear in a um in a commercial cannabis

635
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:21,959
setting in a dab bar so when we had our

636
00:26:20,038 --> 00:26:24,119
panel discussion here everyone was like

637
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:25,600
uh I don't know you know we couldn't

638
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:28,479
really come up with it so me and Colin

639
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:30,359
formed a little committee and um have

640
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,440
been working for a couple months now so

641
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:33,199
I don't know Colin do you want to tell

642
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,320
them about the Sops at all because Colin

643
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,480
developed the Sops and now we need some

644
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:40,480
other people to PE peer review we need

645
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:43,000
to do peer review yeah so it's been

646
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:46,240
super fun we just kind of been meeting

647
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,919
um once a week after hours just um

648
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:51,919
chatting about the need for clean

649
00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:54,640
utensils in a in a social setting that

650
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:57,360
could be used time and time again and

651
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:59,399
how those things are turned over and

652
00:26:57,359 --> 00:27:01,479
what that means and terms of of

653
00:26:59,398 --> 00:27:03,479
disinfecting things and and how to keep

654
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:06,599
that you know really clean for the for

655
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:08,519
the user so they feel safe and they feel

656
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:10,839
like it's a you know a place that they

657
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:13,359
can go to to really use their medicine

658
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:15,639
so we've just you know we put together

659
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:17,119
some guidelines and and kind of a an

660
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:18,640
overview that we're we're working

661
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:21,199
through right now and I I think we'd

662
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,840
like to pass it around to other you know

663
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,360
other people on the panel or other just

664
00:27:22,839 --> 00:27:26,918
other people in our community to get

665
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:29,678
feedback so we can develop this to uh

666
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:32,880
set policy so can help shape that moving

667
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:35,720
forward postco and how people could use

668
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,799
that to inform their businesses and

669
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:40,120
allow them to all operate essentially

670
00:27:37,798 --> 00:27:42,000
because it's it's going to be a tough

671
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:45,158
thing to understand and I think if we

672
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,720
can just have dialogue now um it it

673
00:27:45,159 --> 00:27:49,600
won't be as tough and we can all you

674
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:52,200
know use the information

675
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:53,759
together so um that's kind of where

676
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,319
we're at I mean wouldn't you say I think

677
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:57,640
we've we've got a good framework

678
00:27:55,319 --> 00:27:58,678
together and I think we you know we have

679
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,159
uh

680
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:02,240
you know we've got a good set of people

681
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:04,240
that are that are on the panel right now

682
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,759
but I think you know as Deb was saying I

683
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,480
think we we'd love to to have

684
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:09,079
everybody's thoughts and ideas you know

685
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:10,319
kind of circulate into this document

686
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:12,158
would be

687
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:13,839
great yeah because it's actually

688
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:15,799
multistep right you got to start with

689
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:17,599
the clean surface to clean it then you

690
00:28:15,798 --> 00:28:20,079
got to clean the goop off of it then you

691
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:21,959
got to uh sanitize it then you got to

692
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:24,639
disinfect it and you know then you got

693
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:28,278
to keep it safe in between use and uh

694
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:29,640
our hope is to um postco not have the

695
00:28:28,278 --> 00:28:31,359
government come and say you can't do

696
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,759
that everyone's going to get covid and

697
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:35,639
then we can just step in and be like

698
00:28:32,759 --> 00:28:38,000
well we came up we took months we did a

699
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:40,000
big survey we came up with these ideas

700
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,558
WE peer reviewed them through a bunch of

701
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,798
scientists and experts and uh you don't

702
00:28:42,558 --> 00:28:48,079
need to worry so um it's been pretty fun

a a great opportunity but um bit

748
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:51,038
challenging

749
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:53,440
so yeah so I I just really appreciate

00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:13,679
North County fire burned from the

757
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:16,278
mapping but it turns out that third fire

758
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:19,360
in Santa Cruz in the last almost 50

759
00:31:16,278 --> 00:31:22,638
years and it did not it did not burn we

760
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:25,959
got in sneaking in and you have to do

761
00:31:22,638 --> 00:31:28,319
you have to do it get around the uh you

762
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:31,880
have to those plants need water so it's

763
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:35,200
really scorched and hot but there's safe

764
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:36,440
passage safe road in behind you know

765
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,240
through

766
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:41,759
properties yeah so it's you know another

767
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:44,000
good it's good fortune just again you

768
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:47,038
know it's tragedy if you

769
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:51,119
um it's tragedy if you're in the way but

770
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:56,599
nature does this and you know kind of a

771
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:58,518
I was reading that um quote by uh Dr

772
00:31:56,599 --> 00:32:03,199
Martin Luther King

773
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:06,558
that's uh riots are the protests of the

774
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:09,200
unheard and you know this is what we're

775
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:12,960
see we have it in the streets and we've

776
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:16,840
we've um we're hearing Nature's Riot and

777
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:19,440
um we haven't listened so well I mean

778
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:21,558
even with we just all have to put our

779
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:24,320
ears to the ground and to each other's

780
00:32:21,558 --> 00:32:26,798
heart and try to more deeply listen to

781
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:31,200
the greater needs that are surrounding

782
00:32:26,798 --> 00:32:33,158
us because the world's in a riot and our

783
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:36,399
people are too because we haven't heard

784
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:41,000
and haven't listened and um it's getting

785
00:32:36,398 --> 00:32:42,558
louder and hotter and yeah so but uh

786
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,720
yeah I was just thinking you know even

787
00:32:42,558 --> 00:32:48,839
uh a thousand strikes and covid CO's

788
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:52,558
like this Nature's little biot

789
00:32:48,839 --> 00:32:55,798
terrorism and um and fires and

790
00:32:52,558 --> 00:33:00,079
hurricanes and tornadoes and it's nature

791
00:32:55,798 --> 00:33:02,079
but it is it is profound and impactful

792
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:05,720
and I'm getting ready to host some

793
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:09,079
people again that are displaced a lot of

794
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:11,919
a lot of people in this n in in this

795
00:33:09,079 --> 00:33:13,839
vicinity right now are are in deep

796
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:17,080
trouble and I know that many of you have

797
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:19,278
been faced with with this as well this

798
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:20,798
problem with facing these issues as well

799
00:33:19,278 --> 00:33:23,398
in in your

800
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:27,440
communities so yeah we're going to host

801
00:33:23,398 --> 00:33:31,558
some folks here and U it'll be nice to

802
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:33,679
have some new safe protected covid

803
00:33:31,558 --> 00:33:36,359
protected folks in the house you know

804
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:38,399
it's a it's a crazy time the time that

805
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:40,678
we have to reimagine how to deeply

806
00:33:38,398 --> 00:33:42,239
connect I mean we can deeply connect but

807
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:44,759
it's interesting right we walk around

808
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,599
with masks on and try to see each

809
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:48,319
other's I just I've just gotten to

810
00:33:46,599 --> 00:33:51,240
saying hello to people because it's hard

811
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:53,278
to tell if someone's smiling or not and

812
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:55,599
I think I think that um we want to

813
00:33:53,278 --> 00:33:58,759
connect we really do but it's not that

814
00:33:55,599 --> 00:34:02,319
simple process

815
00:33:58,759 --> 00:34:04,919
so anyway thanks I digressed here a bit

816
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:07,558
thanks for asking Big Love and and

817
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:10,358
respect to you on that and on that note

818
00:34:07,558 --> 00:34:12,960
and that's that's the that's the the big

819
00:34:10,358 --> 00:34:14,759
energy that's been going into everyone's

820
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,639
farm this year I think is just to bring

821
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:19,760
that self-reliance and just that to

822
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:22,200
bring that stability through your own

823
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:24,440
work and through your own community and

824
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:26,239
and realizing that you're as strong as

825
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:29,079
your community that's around you and

826
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:32,199
stuff so big Shout and the big love to

827
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:35,440
Brett from uh do do peros there in Santa

828
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:37,519
Cruz who did lose his home and uh Cruz

829
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,639
extracts few Farms you know that did

830
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:41,960
lose their FS Farms there's ways you can

831
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:44,200
reach out to them and help them but yeah

832
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:47,559
it's been pretty hectic it's been pretty

833
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:49,239
hectic and I love it you know like

834
00:34:47,559 --> 00:34:50,918
Valerie you just said you know people

835
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:52,918
hit the streets people are hitting the

836
00:34:50,918 --> 00:34:56,918
streets and I think that that's just

837
00:34:52,918 --> 00:35:00,480
such an amazing term for uh you know

838
00:34:56,918 --> 00:35:02,559
communing with with our community uh

839
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:05,240
when we say hit the streets and when we

840
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:08,559
say that we're out protesting we're with

841
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:11,159
Community we're we're we're with our our

842
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:14,279
our people and I think that that's more

843
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:17,118
important than ever that we reach out to

844
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:19,079
community right now that even though we

845
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:22,280
might be behind masks we have this

846
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:25,400
incredible ability to reach out to

847
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:28,440
community um and connect almost on a

848
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:30,639
deeper level so you know even though

849
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:33,760
it's through screens and we can't touch

850
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:36,598
and we are isolated physically we're

851
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:39,040
able to go deeper than I know that we've

852
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:42,760
ever gone before and the work that's

853
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:46,239
getting done through community and

854
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:50,119
through connection is astounding right

855
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:53,959
now in this industry and I just have so

856
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:56,358
much love and appreciation for all of

857
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:59,000
these amazing people that are connected

858
00:35:56,358 --> 00:36:01,598
to this master plant doing the good work

859
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,519
for the all of humanity so thank you

860

to be here with all you guys thank you

872
00:36:29,719 --> 00:36:35,679
so much for for having me um been doing

873
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:37,239
a lot of work in the last uh couple

874
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:38,879
years since since I've been on hash

875
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:41,279
church it's been a while I think or

876
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,960
maybe a year since the last time around

877
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:45,119
there yeah it seems like it's been

878
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:47,079
forever since I even did one so I mean

879
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:49,640
even in this 3.0 series there's only

880
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:52,359
been nine of them it's

881
00:36:49,639 --> 00:36:55,879
been yeah so been doing a lot of hemp

882
00:36:52,358 --> 00:37:00,039
Consulting lately so we uh we consulted

883
00:36:55,880 --> 00:37:02,880
for 160 different hemp Farmers uh in

884
00:37:00,039 --> 00:37:05,079
2019 uh which was a journey man we kind

885
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:08,358
of we kind of went into large scale

886
00:37:05,079 --> 00:37:09,839
industrial Agriculture and and we uh we

887
00:37:08,358 --> 00:37:12,318
tried to help a lot of these guys

888
00:37:09,838 --> 00:37:15,400
transition or learn how to grow

889
00:37:12,318 --> 00:37:18,400
organically so chemical Farmers that had

890
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:21,079
been historically you know accustomed to

891
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:23,280
pushing a button to you know take care

892
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:25,839
of their problems were now coming into

893
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:29,000
this whole new world of of growing and

894
00:37:25,838 --> 00:37:32,239
and being in integrity in a different

895
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:35,880
Consciousness with nature so it was uh

896
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:39,279
it was unbelievable to see you know how

897
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:42,079
a human being could actually get uh

898
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:44,880
reconnected to to Nature through the

899
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:46,560
experience of this plant so guys that

900
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,960
have been traditional chemical Farmers

901
00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:51,199
to actually be like wow maybe this is

902
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:54,119
the gateway to a whole another energy or

903
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:56,799
world that uh can teach me how to become

904
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:58,680
more integrated with nature so I got to

905
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:01,760
experience

906
00:37:58,679 --> 00:38:04,039
uh firsthand with hundreds of farmers so

907
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:06,480
it was it was amazing that's incredible

908
00:38:04,039 --> 00:38:09,358
dude see yeah it was it was a beautiful

909
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:11,079
beautiful thing so to to see you know

910
00:38:09,358 --> 00:38:14,838
some of the things that are happening

911
00:38:11,079 --> 00:38:17,839
now uh the relativity of what had

912
00:38:14,838 --> 00:38:19,960
happened um you know in my experience

913
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:22,239
and watching these Farmers is almost

914
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:25,000
like it's like an education that maybe

915
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:27,879
right now what we need to do is all as a

916
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,760
community like dragonfly was saying has

917
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:34,519
kind of come together in a more integ

918
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:38,119
integrated interdependent way where

919
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:42,679
where we're understanding that that um

920
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:46,079
taking care of our Earth right now uh

921
00:38:42,679 --> 00:38:48,838
for her she's crying out to us you know

922
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:51,280
is is so important to to solve a lot of

923
00:38:48,838 --> 00:38:52,719
these issues from the ground up and and

924
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,240
and so that's what we're doing with with

925
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:57,159
soil balance is trying to take care of

926
00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:59,039
the soil because the more we we care for

927
00:38:57,159 --> 00:39:01,759
our Earth in a in a considerate

928
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:03,599
compassionate way relatively speaking

929
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,839
everything should get a lot you know

930
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:07,838
more

931
00:39:04,838 --> 00:39:11,279
balanced I love it's more balanced in I

932
00:39:07,838 --> 00:39:14,920
love I love the idea of chemical Farmers

933
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:18,800
transitioning into a more sustainable

934
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:20,680
regenerative organic way and and having

935
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:23,560
Revelations about it that's that's

936
00:39:20,679 --> 00:39:26,960
pretty cool right there it was far out

937
00:39:23,559 --> 00:39:30,000
it was heard of the term chemical

938
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:32,119
chemical farmer before in a way being a

939
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,440
chemist that kind of excites me right

940
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:34,440
but

941
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:40,239
um chemical farmer just a non-organic

942
00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:43,480
farmer is that what you're defining

943
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:47,199
chemical uh yeah the guys that are using

944
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:51,838
systemic fungicides and and biocides and

945
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:54,239
uh synthetic FS yeah basically so a

946
00:39:51,838 --> 00:39:56,519
conventional a conventional yeah yeah

947
00:39:54,239 --> 00:39:58,559
conventional what a nice word they gave

948
00:39:56,519 --> 00:40:00,440
themselves though eh they yeah chemical

949
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:02,119
farming like there could actually grow

950
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:04,480
and make

951
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:06,559
chemicals everything's a

952
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,920
chemical is doing it making

953
00:40:06,559 --> 00:40:11,719
phytochemicals I mean y let's not you

954
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:14,119
know distinguish between well we do

955
00:40:11,719 --> 00:40:17,118
distinguish between a little bit because

956
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:18,920
phyto in front of chemical kind of

957
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:21,400
changes the definition of that

958
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:24,280
particular chemical at least in regards

959
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:25,880
to where it came from and so then that

960
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:28,000
gives people their belief systems right

961
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:30,720
they're like well I trust nature but I

962
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,719
don't trust

963
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:38,318
Dupont and Peter you said you consulted

964
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:41,560
for a couple hundred businesses how many

965
00:40:38,318 --> 00:40:44,559
of them grew a crop in 2020 in other

966
00:40:41,559 --> 00:40:49,599
words how many of them in N

967
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:52,559
2019 actually made a profit on growing H

968
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:55,400
that's a great question so we we again

969
00:40:52,559 --> 00:41:00,239
we consulted for 160 pretty large scale

970
00:40:55,400 --> 00:41:03,280
uh operations um right now uh

971
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:05,399
95% of our customers are not growing

972
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:08,960
hemp again this season and and they're

973
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:11,559
sitting on uh millions of pounds of of

974
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:13,720
biomass that they can't sell and you

975
00:41:11,559 --> 00:41:16,078
know I I've thought a lot about why that

976
00:41:13,719 --> 00:41:20,480
is and one of the things that that I

977
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:23,079
believe is that um you know they they

978
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:24,838
they spent so much time with the the

979
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:27,880
logistics of cultivating that they

980
00:41:24,838 --> 00:41:30,078
didn't put enough focus on you know good

981
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:33,000
cultivation methodologies and practices

982
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:35,440
in taking care of their soil and so the

983
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:40,000
tpine levels inside the finished

984
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:41,519
commodity were like 0.1 0.2% tpin so

985
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,519
then what they were doing is they were

986
00:41:41,519 --> 00:41:45,719
um taking that oil they were actually

987
00:41:43,519 --> 00:41:48,159
processing it you know on an industrial

988
00:41:45,719 --> 00:41:50,118
scale with ethanol and CO2 and what was

989
00:41:48,159 --> 00:41:52,279
happening is those those processing

990
00:41:50,119 --> 00:41:55,119
methods were were burning out that very

991
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:56,960
small amount of turpine content that was

992
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:58,680
inside of the flower so what ended up

993
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:02,720
happening in was you know people were

994
00:41:58,679 --> 00:42:07,838
started to sell this this uh you know

995
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:09,519
full spectrum organic CBD isolate really

996
00:42:07,838 --> 00:42:12,119
because it didn't have the the most

997
00:42:09,519 --> 00:42:15,239
important compounds uh to to the

998
00:42:12,119 --> 00:42:17,599
efficacy you know know full spectrum

999
00:42:15,239 --> 00:42:21,039
isolate that caught my ear as

1000
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:22,160
well I heard that too heard that too it

1001
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:24,519
would have to be

1002
00:42:22,159 --> 00:42:26,199
disate and it wouldn't be full spectrum

1003
00:42:24,519 --> 00:42:28,599
because distillate isn't full spectrum

1004
00:42:26,199 --> 00:42:31,199
well here's the thing the the CBD the

1005
00:42:28,599 --> 00:42:33,599
CBD was going into these tines and bait

1006
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:36,639
pens and and Edibles and topicals people

1007
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:38,000
were using CBD um and they were

1008
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:40,239
disenchanted so they're like I'm

1009
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,000
spending 60 bucks on this CBD tinure and

1010
00:42:40,239 --> 00:42:44,639
I don't feel anything am I supposed to

1011
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:48,280
feel something and so what ended up

1012
00:42:44,639 --> 00:42:50,598
happening was um my opinion was that

1013
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:52,160
those tpin were not in that finished

1014
00:42:50,599 --> 00:42:54,920
product that was being put out to the

1015
00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:56,639
market on a large large scale and so the

1016
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:57,960
absorption rates in the industry were

1017
00:42:56,639 --> 00:43:01,358
really low

1018
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:03,199
because um it didn't work you know it

1019
00:43:01,358 --> 00:43:05,838
was working it was working I mean they

1020
00:43:03,199 --> 00:43:07,799
were getting it effect there was if the

1021
00:43:05,838 --> 00:43:10,239
tinure is made with an extract where the

1022
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:13,640
tpin are retained then they're going to

1023
00:43:10,239 --> 00:43:15,959
have all the plantin and probably plant

1024
00:43:13,639 --> 00:43:20,118
pigments going to taste like but if it's

1025
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:20,119
just made with isolate or you know even

1026
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:26,679
distillate oh Mark you got muted well a

1027
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:28,519
dist a distillate with no tpin right so

1028
00:43:26,679 --> 00:43:32,318
again the the flour has

1029
00:43:28,519 --> 00:43:34,480
0.1% tpes in it the the the the CO2 and

1030
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:37,000
the ethanol goes into an extreme heat as

1031
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:38,639
you guys know as processors it burns out

1032
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,400
the small amount of tpin that are in

1033
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:42,519
there and if you look at the profiles of

1034
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:44,400
the treated flour there was only maybe

1035
00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:46,440
five or six types of Tarpin in the

1036
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:48,680
profile versus like what you guys are

1037
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:50,800
getting is like 20 types of tpin are

1038
00:43:48,679 --> 00:43:52,440
what dragonfly gets they get a broad

1039
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,400
spectrum because they they've got that

1040
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:56,318
biodiversity in there so you're already

1041
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:59,079
starting out with a disadvantage then

1042
00:43:56,318 --> 00:44:01,558
you're burning the out and so you know

1043
00:43:59,079 --> 00:44:03,160
again it was advertised as this amazing

1044
00:44:01,559 --> 00:44:04,640
product that's going to heal people

1045
00:44:03,159 --> 00:44:06,920
started taking it and they didn't really

1046
00:44:04,639 --> 00:44:09,960
feel much and so they didn't want to

1047
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:12,838
spend 60 bucks again on on a tin what

1048
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:15,079
what about the idea of these farmers who

1049
00:44:12,838 --> 00:44:17,679
were uh conventional Farmers I'm

1050
00:44:15,079 --> 00:44:20,280
guessing their land was you know very

1051
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:22,000
contaminated with synthetic chemicals

1052
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:25,079
and then they're planting a phyto

1053
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:27,480
remediative plant like hemp I wonder

1054
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:30,880
what that plant would be pulling up up

1055
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:32,838
into this you know into its very being

1056
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:34,800
like right into its cells right into the

1057
00:44:32,838 --> 00:44:37,159
resin right into all of those things

1058
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:38,680
because that would be uh that would be

1059
00:44:37,159 --> 00:44:41,679
that would that's always my kind of

1060
00:44:38,679 --> 00:44:43,838
worry and you know most of those most of

1061
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:47,399
those chemicals degrade though you know

1062
00:44:43,838 --> 00:44:50,558
and they degrade and when they do uh

1063
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:53,880
they're mostly degraded by like light

1064
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:56,280
and and heat but also mostly degraded by

1065
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:58,880
by bugs by microbes I mean a lot of

1066
00:44:56,280 --> 00:45:00,880
those they're just organic compounds and

1067
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:04,400
they're degraded in the soil so there's

1068
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:06,519
not really too many persistent compounds

1069
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:08,559
that are used well there's a few and I

1070
00:45:06,519 --> 00:45:11,800
know the tobacco industry has one called

1071
00:45:08,559 --> 00:45:13,920
radium 226 because it's how Joe Strobel

1072
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:16,359
one of the first hemp farmers in Canada

1073
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:18,000
learned that hemp was a fighter

1074
00:45:16,358 --> 00:45:19,639
remediative plant because people weren't

1075
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,358
really talking about it at least in the

1076
00:45:19,639 --> 00:45:24,358
small circles we knew of back then but

1077
00:45:22,358 --> 00:45:26,400
this tobacco Farmer Joe Strobel who got

1078
00:45:24,358 --> 00:45:30,719
the first license to grow hemp in Canada

1079
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:33,039
in over like 75 years 1994 in Ontario he

1080
00:45:30,719 --> 00:45:35,519
was a tobacco farmer and Jeff K was his

1081
00:45:33,039 --> 00:45:37,440
partner was a lawyer they got it done

1082
00:45:35,519 --> 00:45:39,358
they planted this 5 acre experimental

1083
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:41,760
field and I guess because of this

1084
00:45:39,358 --> 00:45:44,078
chemical this radioactive nucleotide

1085
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:46,240
that basically gets put into the soil

1086
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:48,200
they have to like test the soil every

1087
00:45:46,239 --> 00:45:50,959
year and at the end of the hemp crop

1088
00:45:48,199 --> 00:45:52,879
they tested it and it was shockingly low

1089
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:54,838
lower than they'd ever seen it go down

1090
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:57,039
by like some ridiculous amount I don't

1091
00:45:54,838 --> 00:45:59,400
know what it was but five or 10 times

1092
00:45:57,039 --> 00:46:01,519
and so then they had to test the hemp to

1093
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:03,880
figure out what was going on and that

1094
00:46:01,519 --> 00:46:07,000
was actually you know that was the that

1095
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:09,838
was the information that came to our

1096
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:12,480
group that started that uh fighter

1097
00:46:09,838 --> 00:46:14,400
remediative project project in Chernobyl

1098
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:16,159
growing hemp to remove radioactive

1099
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:18,800
nucleotides out of the soil because it

1100
00:46:16,159 --> 00:46:21,199
definitely does that it does it does and

1101
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:23,800
it pulls out heavy metals um it can pull

1102
00:46:21,199 --> 00:46:26,239
out all kinds of different uh you know

1103
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:29,240
um locked up chlorinated hydrocarbons

1104
00:46:26,239 --> 00:46:31,318
that are ins solubilized in the soil so

1105
00:46:29,239 --> 00:46:33,759
um one of the things that we really

1106
00:46:31,318 --> 00:46:36,639
tried to do was cultivate the hemp in a

1107
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:39,319
highly biologically active system where

1108
00:46:36,639 --> 00:46:41,558
you know the biology on thousands of

1109
00:46:39,318 --> 00:46:44,880
Acres was was dead it was it was

1110
00:46:41,559 --> 00:46:47,400
destroyed because of you know how the

1111
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:50,358
compounds in in a lot of these materials

1112
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:53,639
actually burns out the the biology so

1113
00:46:50,358 --> 00:46:55,159
what we had to do because um just to

1114
00:46:53,639 --> 00:46:57,598
digress a little bit what what good

1115
00:46:55,159 --> 00:47:00,358
biology will do is it will actually grow

1116
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:02,960
on the rizosphere and it will kind of

1117
00:47:00,358 --> 00:47:04,960
mediate some of the absorption rates of

1118
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:07,318
toxins that go into the plant believe it

1119
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:09,079
or not it's a beautiful natural thing

1120
00:47:07,318 --> 00:47:11,199
and the correct biology can actually

1121
00:47:09,079 --> 00:47:12,960
attach to those hydrocarbons um

1122
00:47:11,199 --> 00:47:14,960
solubilize them and help them leech out

1123
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:16,760
of the soil by increasing the bulk

1124
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:18,920
density of the soil and and and the

1125
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:21,040
paracity so that way when water comes in

1126
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:23,519
a lot of those toxins are leeched out

1127
00:47:21,039 --> 00:47:25,000
and and purified um but that isn't the

1128
00:47:23,519 --> 00:47:28,000
case in a lot of these large scale

1129
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:30,920
operations so we had to really um you

1130
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:33,280
know do some preliminary testing you

1131
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:34,680
know um we couldn't plant like in in

1132
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:36,920
areas where they were doing cotton

1133
00:47:34,679 --> 00:47:38,480
because of glyphosate drift I mean there

1134
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:41,000
were there were so many different

1135
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:42,679
challenges uh that what we what we faced

1136
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,880
and it's it's been a battle man it's

1137
00:47:42,679 --> 00:47:48,799
been like 14 hour days working with

1138
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:50,240
these guys um and uh trying to help them

1139
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:52,359
really I mean that's that's the whole

1140
00:47:50,239 --> 00:47:54,318
focus and right now it's it's

1141
00:47:52,358 --> 00:47:56,598
unfortunate that that a lot of these

1142
00:47:54,318 --> 00:47:59,519
farmers are not able you know good good

1143
00:47:56,599 --> 00:48:01,200
people people kind beautiful people that

1144
00:47:59,519 --> 00:48:02,559
that want to you know grow this plant

1145
00:48:01,199 --> 00:48:04,879
they believe in this plant they believe

1146
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:08,040
it's it's it's going to help so much and

1147
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:10,440
and uh they're having a hard time on on

1148
00:48:08,039 --> 00:48:13,318
top of all the other so so so here's a

1149
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:15,240
question kind of to Mark H Dr Mark as

1150
00:48:13,318 --> 00:48:16,440
well as to dragonfly Earth medicine

1151
00:48:15,239 --> 00:48:19,239
because I hear mark saying well those

1152
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:20,679
are you know I he used the term chemical

1153
00:48:19,239 --> 00:48:23,159
wrong and I could see that get under

1154
00:48:20,679 --> 00:48:25,159
your skin as a chemist and that's okay

1155
00:48:23,159 --> 00:48:28,039
that's okay don't worry about

1156
00:48:25,159 --> 00:48:30,159
it chemicals we're all chemicals it's

1157
00:48:28,039 --> 00:48:33,039
true but at the same time don't you

1158
00:48:30,159 --> 00:48:34,759
believe Mark Dr Mark that some of the

1159
00:48:33,039 --> 00:48:37,239
chemicals that are being put on the

1160
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:39,160
scale on large scale are destroying the

1161
00:48:37,239 --> 00:48:40,959
soil or they do you really believe they

1162
00:48:39,159 --> 00:48:42,519
absolutely yeah they must be right they

1163
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:44,838
not they're not destroying the soil but

1164
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:48,159
what they're in doing is they're alter

1165
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:51,159
they're altering the bi they're right

1166
00:48:48,159 --> 00:48:54,039
they're and and so it's kind of like

1167
00:48:51,159 --> 00:48:57,159
Mother Nature's biome will kind of adapt

1168
00:48:54,039 --> 00:48:59,000
to this new synthetic chemical that Dow

1169
00:48:57,159 --> 00:49:02,399
or dupon or whoever is making and

1170
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:03,760
spraying but like like one of the things

1171
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,200
that I noticed I mean it's really

1172
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:08,839
interesting to hear you say all that

1173
00:49:05,199 --> 00:49:11,838
Peter because um the folks around here

1174
00:49:08,838 --> 00:49:14,960
well so I where I live in Pennsylvania

1175
00:49:11,838 --> 00:49:18,119
most of the Amish are also tobacco

1176
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:21,318
farmers and so they understand growing a

1177
00:49:18,119 --> 00:49:25,480
crop for essentially essential oil or

1178
00:49:21,318 --> 00:49:28,199
for to be sold for smoking purposes so

1179
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:31,159
they're able to basically grow to the

1180
00:49:28,199 --> 00:49:33,078
volume at which they can dry and so they

1181
00:49:31,159 --> 00:49:35,318
all have these tobacco barns they're

1182
00:49:33,079 --> 00:49:38,240
really cool looking barns they're the

1183
00:49:35,318 --> 00:49:40,798
sides of the Barn open like wings right

1184
00:49:38,239 --> 00:49:43,039
because it could air out the the air has

1185
00:49:40,798 --> 00:49:45,119
to exchange and so the tobacco gets

1186
00:49:43,039 --> 00:49:46,838
picked right around the time that hemp

1187
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:49,358
gets picked actually gets picked just

1188
00:49:46,838 --> 00:49:52,119
prior to that gets hung up in these

1189
00:49:49,358 --> 00:49:54,639
Barns and I tell you man when you walk

1190
00:49:52,119 --> 00:49:57,480
up to the edge of these barns I'm not a

1191
00:49:54,639 --> 00:49:59,759
cigarette smoker I don't use tobacco any

1192
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:03,880
form when you walk up next to these

1193
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:05,839
barns man that air is intoxicating it is

1194
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:08,200
really for a non-cigarette smoker like

1195
00:50:05,838 --> 00:50:10,880
whoa you're just kind of like Blown Away

1196
00:50:08,199 --> 00:50:13,039
by it but anyway the first year that

1197
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:15,838
they really grew widespread around here

1198
00:50:13,039 --> 00:50:18,119
most of these Farms are on the order of

1199
00:50:15,838 --> 00:50:22,400
about 10 some of them are more like

1200
00:50:18,119 --> 00:50:25,680
around 40 to 60 to 80 acres and a lot of

1201
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:28,160
them grow feed corn for uh for the dairy

1202
00:50:25,679 --> 00:50:30,000
industry pretty big in my area of

1203
00:50:28,159 --> 00:50:32,920
Pennsylvania but again they're also

1204
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:35,599
growing tobacco and where they grew

1205
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:37,519
tobacco they have a whole system where

1206
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:40,079
they have these carts that go out and

1207
00:50:37,519 --> 00:50:41,559
they hang tobacco leaves on the cart and

1208
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:43,240
they bring well they didn't have all

1209
00:50:41,559 --> 00:50:45,160
that worked out for hemp so they needed

1210
00:50:43,239 --> 00:50:47,318
to figure that out so last year was kind

1211
00:50:45,159 --> 00:50:49,879
of like a a training wheels years you

1212
00:50:47,318 --> 00:50:52,679
know a lot of them they didn't dry right

1213
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:55,640
away some of them had issues

1214
00:50:52,679 --> 00:50:57,879
with bugs and some of them had issues

1215
00:50:55,639 --> 00:50:59,719
with some people brought dryers into the

1216
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:01,280
area were able to dry him but for the

1217
00:50:59,719 --> 00:51:03,598
most part I think they had a pretty

1218
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:07,559
successful crop when they compare it to

1219
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:09,760
the return on value that they can get uh

1220
00:51:07,559 --> 00:51:12,079
compared to another crop so a lot of

1221
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:13,880
these folks are growing ornamentals you

1222
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:17,798
know for the flow markets and they're

1223
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:19,960
growing uh vegetables like tomatoes and

1224
00:51:17,798 --> 00:51:22,798
melons cantaloupes watermelons stuff

1225
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:25,920
like that yeah so um it is a different

1226
00:51:22,798 --> 00:51:27,599
kind of Agriculture but um to speak to

1227
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:30,240
your organic thing I think a lot of

1228
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:32,318
these folks grow organically and what

1229
00:51:30,239 --> 00:51:36,199
they're doing is they're they're bolting

1230
00:51:32,318 --> 00:51:38,920
on The Organic certification onto their

1231
00:51:36,199 --> 00:51:41,318
existing Organic certification so if you

1232
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:43,920
already have an organic farm and they've

1233
00:51:41,318 --> 00:51:46,400
already been come out to certify it to

1234
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:48,639
make sure that your processes and really

1235
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:51,480
everything that touches the crop is

1236
00:51:48,639 --> 00:51:54,118
organic and chemical free although they

1237
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:56,639
do list uh a list of chemicals that you

1238
00:51:54,119 --> 00:51:59,240
could use in an organic thing they just

1239
00:51:56,639 --> 00:52:00,798
organic chemicals but organic chemicals

1240
00:51:59,239 --> 00:52:03,519
you know just to finally divide it I

1241
00:52:00,798 --> 00:52:06,318
mean I miss organic chemical unless

1242
00:52:03,519 --> 00:52:10,880
we're importing feed stocks from Mars

1243
00:52:06,318 --> 00:52:12,838
everything comes from planet Earth so um

1244
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:15,400
uh where was I going with oh that's not

1245
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:17,599
true I've been to s's house and I've

1246
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:19,880
seen some [ __ ] that was absolutely not

1247
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:22,960
from planet

1248
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:26,039
Eartha come on now bringing in some

1249
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:28,760
stuff from sad Stardust right but I I

1250
00:52:26,039 --> 00:52:31,639
think for the most part um I would say

1251
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:34,119
that what really stalled was sort of

1252
00:52:31,639 --> 00:52:38,519
like the the

1253
00:52:34,119 --> 00:52:42,280
FDA in making an exception and the fdn C

1254
00:52:38,519 --> 00:52:44,759
rule so they could include CBD in things

1255
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:47,440
like topicals and foods and stuff like

1256
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:50,119
that and so what that did is it created

1257
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:52,760
all this huge glut of biomass that's on

1258
00:52:50,119 --> 00:52:55,200
the market and and what that did is it

1259
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:58,040
made so about a year ago the price of

1260
00:52:55,199 --> 00:53:00,318
isolate from large manufacturers in like

1261
00:52:58,039 --> 00:53:02,838
Portland and Denver area that were

1262
00:53:00,318 --> 00:53:05,639
processing lots of H price of isolate

1263
00:53:02,838 --> 00:53:08,880
was on the order of about 5,000 to maybe

1264
00:53:05,639 --> 00:53:10,798
7,000 a kilo and that's for multiple

1265
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:12,760
kilograms and they want to look for you

1266
00:53:10,798 --> 00:53:17,000
know big contracts so they could set up

1267
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:19,200
some big Supply chains well now uh the

1268
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:22,760
bottom has just crashed on that market

1269
00:53:19,199 --> 00:53:25,639
you can get those same kilograms now for

1270
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:27,359
less than ,000 a kilogram so there's

1271
00:53:25,639 --> 00:53:29,719
such a supply

1272
00:53:27,358 --> 00:53:32,480
but there's no real pull through in the

1273
00:53:29,719 --> 00:53:34,919
retail you say that and then you go on

1274
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:36,599
the internet and you find all of these

1275
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:40,599
companies selling everything from

1276
00:53:36,599 --> 00:53:43,519
gummies to lotions to all this stuff

1277
00:53:40,599 --> 00:53:45,880
that you know is uh as you know pet was

1278
00:53:43,519 --> 00:53:47,759
saying is derived from hemp so a lot of

1279
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:49,480
folks are putting you know either

1280
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:52,559
isolate there's this

1281
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:55,880
whole category now of tfree distillates

1282
00:53:52,559 --> 00:54:00,559
so in order for it to be farm bill legal

1283
00:53:55,880 --> 00:54:02,599
it has have a THC content of below um 3%

1284
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:05,319
so there's a whole new how about the new

1285
00:54:02,599 --> 00:54:07,240
amendment that the da how about the new

1286
00:54:05,318 --> 00:54:09,838
Amendment the DEA just made to the

1287
00:54:07,239 --> 00:54:10,919
definition of of H well what what so

1288
00:54:09,838 --> 00:54:13,440
what they're trying to do with that

1289
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:16,039
Marcus is they're trying they they're

1290
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:18,039
they're trying to harmonize the controll

1291
00:54:16,039 --> 00:54:20,400
dangerous substance act with the farm

1292
00:54:18,039 --> 00:54:24,440
bill so the farm bill basically says if

1293
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:27,318
it's below 3% THC attempt therefore it's

1294
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:31,519
legal by the farm bill well we all know

1295
00:54:27,318 --> 00:54:36,159
that even if you uh purify the oil or

1296
00:54:31,519 --> 00:54:38,880
even if you shuck the buds from 3% plant

1297
00:54:36,159 --> 00:54:41,639
you're going to purify Beyond that3

1298
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:44,200
certainly when you make a a crude uh

1299
00:54:41,639 --> 00:54:46,598
extract or a distillate or an isolate

1300
00:54:44,199 --> 00:54:48,879
well not the isolate but the distillate

1301
00:54:46,599 --> 00:54:51,559
you're going to concentrate the the THC

1302
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:55,079
and so I I don't think they truly

1303
00:54:51,559 --> 00:54:57,040
fundamentally understood that when they

1304
00:54:55,079 --> 00:54:58,798
when they passed the farm bill

1305
00:54:57,039 --> 00:55:01,719
and so what that's come up with now is

1306
00:54:58,798 --> 00:55:03,838
now again there's a whole new group of

1307
00:55:01,719 --> 00:55:07,798
processors that are basically offering

1308
00:55:03,838 --> 00:55:09,920
what's called tfree remedi or distillate

1309
00:55:07,798 --> 00:55:13,400
remediation will take the distillate

1310
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:15,280
that's got a THC higher it won't matter

1311
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:18,240
though because the way that Amendment

1312
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:21,960
sits is that the second your product

1313
00:55:18,239 --> 00:55:24,000
becomes over 3% it's now a schedule one

1314
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:26,760
substance yeah you're right and so in

1315
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:30,000
your in your workflow you're now now

1316
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:32,319
breaking a schedule one law right right

1317
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:35,679
and so no one's going to be like that's

1318
00:55:32,318 --> 00:55:38,759
that's a major blow

1319
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:42,078
they classify something called work in

1320
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:44,559
progress hemp extract and so the work in

1321
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:47,920
progress hemp exract so everything

1322
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:52,599
between the biomass and the diluted

1323
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:54,680
tincture itself is all yeah schedule one

1324
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:56,798
but they wanted to basically say look if

1325
00:55:54,679 --> 00:55:59,679
that's in a process

1326
00:55:56,798 --> 00:56:02,880
where it's not you know being sold or

1327
00:55:59,679 --> 00:56:05,279
not crossing state lines and it's okay

1328
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:07,280
but you know it yeah it has uh created a

1329
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:08,400
lot of upset in the industry and the

1330
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:10,200
other thing that people were doing

1331
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:13,680
markets we kind of talked a little bit

1332
00:56:10,199 --> 00:56:15,759
about this on the chat is um a lot of

1333
00:56:13,679 --> 00:56:19,480
people because of the price of CBD is

1334
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:24,599
down they're converting THC over into

1335
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:27,559
Delta 8 THC by michan's chemistry thank

1336
00:56:24,599 --> 00:56:31,280
you professor michul for pointing out

1337
00:56:27,559 --> 00:56:33,760
that you can just treat um CBD under

1338
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:36,480
acidic conditions and in fact I think

1339
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:38,920
when people were making CBD distillate

1340
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:41,480
and they were adding bleaching Clays to

1341
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:43,920
the CBD distillate they were when they

1342
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:45,599
were distilling they were observing THC

1343
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:49,119
over in the product and I think it's

1344
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:51,680
because the CLE the Clays themselves are

1345
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:56,280
acidic in nature and are acidic enough

1346
00:56:51,679 --> 00:56:59,399
to promote the um isomerization from CBD

1347
00:56:56,280 --> 00:57:01,039
over the THC but you get delta8 THC

1348
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:03,039
almost predominantly but you do get a

1349
00:57:01,039 --> 00:57:05,920
little bit of Delta 9 and that's one of

1350
00:57:03,039 --> 00:57:07,839
the issues with the Delta 8 Supply now

1351
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:12,720
and you see Delta 8 all over the place

1352
00:57:07,838 --> 00:57:16,159
most of that Delta 8 has Beyond 3% Delta

1353
00:57:12,719 --> 00:57:19,399
9 which is which is part of what is

1354
00:57:16,159 --> 00:57:21,519
problematic about that DEA interim final

1355
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:23,480
ruling that's what they call it interim

1356
00:57:21,519 --> 00:57:24,798
final R final ruling did you see the

1357
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:26,679
second part of

1358
00:57:24,798 --> 00:57:28,280
it uh well

1359
00:57:26,679 --> 00:57:31,000
I know that they're asking for public

1360
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:33,559
comment so well before before public

1361
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:35,960
comment in the definition change they

1362
00:57:33,559 --> 00:57:39,359
also made another change which was for

1363
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:41,798
any companies that had FDA whatever the

1364
00:57:39,358 --> 00:57:44,159
term is compliancy or approved or

1365
00:57:41,798 --> 00:57:47,000
whatever which I think one company in

1366
00:57:44,159 --> 00:57:49,358
the world has they no longer have to

1367
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:52,039
apply for import or export licenses to

1368
00:57:49,358 --> 00:57:54,078
move their product over the border so

1369
00:57:52,039 --> 00:57:56,440
that's the part that may left an even

1370
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:59,640
worse taste in my mouth about the whole

1371
00:57:56,440 --> 00:58:02,920
thing when I saw that I was like oh man

1372
00:57:59,639 --> 00:58:07,199
they are like lining up the chess

1373
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:08,480
board yeah Mark you you kind of brought

1374
00:58:07,199 --> 00:58:11,679
something up I've been thinking a lot

1375
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:13,760
about I I grew I work with a 2600 Acre

1376
00:58:11,679 --> 00:58:17,480
Farm in up state New York that is fully

1377
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:19,960
regenerative um certified organic and we

1378
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:23,400
you know they they grow 30 Acres of of

1379
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:25,240
hemp on rotation up there and um you

1380
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:27,880
know last season you know we've been

1381
00:58:25,239 --> 00:58:30,118
work been asked specifically for T free

1382
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:33,880
I mean this whole year it's just been T

1383
00:58:30,119 --> 00:58:35,519
free do you have T free um but then it

1384
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:37,760
you know as I look at the Barns and I

1385
00:58:35,519 --> 00:58:41,440
look at the totes I just I question like

1386
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:43,480
what's enough and how do we all balance

1387
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:45,599
the amount that we grow versus what

1388
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:48,960
someone else grows so there is Harmony

1389
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:50,960
and everyone does have a a place and

1390
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:53,039
then it goes back to the idea of

1391
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:55,440
Appalachia and then the terar that we've

1392
00:58:53,039 --> 00:58:57,240
all been talking about about specific

1393
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:59,358
regions only working with specific Cult

1394
00:58:57,239 --> 00:59:02,159
of ours you know what what are your

1395
00:58:59,358 --> 00:59:04,239
thoughts on on what's enough guys like I

1396
00:59:02,159 --> 00:59:07,960
I I think about this often you know

1397
00:59:04,239 --> 00:59:10,038
because it's we've learned to scale but

1398
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:13,960
you know what's what's the right amount

1399
00:59:10,039 --> 00:59:16,200
to scale to you know so I think my

1400
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:17,720
thoughts are that dragonfly Earth

1401
00:59:16,199 --> 00:59:19,598
medicine and permaculture and some of

1402
00:59:17,719 --> 00:59:22,038
the Growers that I'm talking to with

1403
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:24,920
what they're doing like if we actually

1404
00:59:22,039 --> 00:59:27,640
have again a deep a deeper connection

1405
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:30,240
and and respect and do things in

1406
00:59:27,639 --> 00:59:32,598
Integrity with our planet then a

1407
00:59:30,239 --> 00:59:36,439
permaculture setting is actually going

1408
00:59:32,599 --> 00:59:38,760
to produce uh the correct amount of food

1409
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:42,400
that that we can sustain our populations

1410
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:42,400
on I mean they've already figured it

1411
00:59:42,820 --> 00:59:49,798
[Laughter]

1412
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:52,559
out true enough true enough oh you're

1413
00:59:49,798 --> 00:59:56,440
muted planet's intelligence is is just

1414
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:58,760
so so so uh you know perfect it's a

1415
00:59:56,440 --> 01:00:00,599
sacred vessel that we just have to you

1416
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:02,720
know allow to produce the amount of

1417
01:00:00,599 --> 01:00:05,359
tomatoes and corn and cabbage and wheat

1418
01:00:02,719 --> 01:00:07,239
and soy that we need to eat and and

1419
01:00:05,358 --> 01:00:10,400
it'll and it'll show us what what we're

1420
01:00:07,239 --> 01:00:12,719
supposed to to have you know what we're

1421
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:13,760
supposed to receive from it way that I

1422
01:00:12,719 --> 01:00:16,480
go of see

1423
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:18,280
it I'm I'm gonna speak I'm gonna speak

1424
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:19,798
in an analogy for a second I'm gonna

1425
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:23,798
speak with analogy and I've done this

1426
01:00:19,798 --> 01:00:27,079
before right so um I used to say that

1427
01:00:23,798 --> 01:00:29,079
you know THC is the deep end CBD is the

1428
01:00:27,079 --> 01:00:31,079
shallow end and the two ends of the pool

1429
01:00:29,079 --> 01:00:33,559
are connected together right and so

1430
01:00:31,079 --> 01:00:36,039
mother nature didn't make an exclusion

1431
01:00:33,559 --> 01:00:39,760
but the analogy I'd like to use for for

1432
01:00:36,039 --> 01:00:41,440
the tfree thing is purple paint right so

1433
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:44,760
what's purple paint made of it's made of

1434
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:46,798
red paint and blue paint right so uh

1435
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:51,400
well in the political year we'll call

1436
01:00:46,798 --> 01:00:52,838
CBD blue and we'll call THC red okay so

1437
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:55,280
you have to

1438
01:00:52,838 --> 01:00:57,279
separate the red from the blue paint

1439
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:59,200
yeah you can do it by chromatography but

1440
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:02,880
you get a big fraction in the Middle

1441
01:00:59,199 --> 01:01:04,598
where you get a lot of THC and CBD you

1442
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:07,680
have to bring right back through in your

1443
01:01:04,599 --> 01:01:10,440
chromatography so chromatography is just

1444
01:01:07,679 --> 01:01:12,879
not it's a ugly process it doesn't scale

1445
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:16,079
well you have to use a shitload of

1446
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:19,480
solvent it's expensive it just the whole

1447
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:22,798
need to make a tfree product is just

1448
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:25,000
completely just ludicrous all based on

1449
01:01:22,798 --> 01:01:27,719
they didn't figure well if the plants

1450
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:29,519
got three G when they concentrate it

1451
01:01:27,719 --> 01:01:31,759
it's going to be more you know

1452
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:34,079
concentrated as long as it's back down

1453
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:36,640
to the three in the final product that

1454
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:38,839
only puts it in tinctures and lotions

1455
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:41,679
and stuff like that okay so you can't

1456
01:01:38,838 --> 01:01:44,880
dab It Whatever at least they should be

1457
01:01:41,679 --> 01:01:47,639
able to make it harmonize in that way so

1458
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:49,720
the work in progress hemp extract has

1459
01:01:47,639 --> 01:01:52,480
got to be something that they got to let

1460
01:01:49,719 --> 01:01:54,519
hemp processors be able to handle right

1461
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:56,880
because if you're bringing in three into

1462
01:01:54,519 --> 01:01:58,599
the building as soon as you concentrate

1463
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:01,838
it as soon as you grind it as soon as

1464
01:01:58,599 --> 01:02:04,119
you make an extract out of it it's over3

1465
01:02:01,838 --> 01:02:06,719
so the whole point of the industry is to

1466
01:02:04,119 --> 01:02:09,039
be able to extract and use the plant

1467
01:02:06,719 --> 01:02:12,239
that the farm bill has already said is

1468
01:02:09,039 --> 01:02:14,039
legal well they and they let that happen

1469
01:02:12,239 --> 01:02:17,199
they let that happen right to the point

1470
01:02:14,039 --> 01:02:19,520
where the industry almost destroyed

1471
01:02:17,199 --> 01:02:21,879
itself and it's there's no value in the

1472
01:02:19,519 --> 01:02:24,000
product now well and Marcus what that

1473
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:26,880
tells you is how bright the intellectual

1474
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:30,838
furnaces are that are burning down easy

1475
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:32,480
days right I mean so well and and I

1476
01:02:30,838 --> 01:02:34,239
apologize to jump in but Valerie Could

1477
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:37,039
you actually speak on a little bit of

1478
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:40,118
your experience on the efficacy of like

1479
01:02:37,039 --> 01:02:43,839
natural like the the actual extract kind

1480
01:02:40,119 --> 01:02:46,200
of ratios of the plant uh versus this

1481
01:02:43,838 --> 01:02:48,199
whole kind of conversation around tfree

1482
01:02:46,199 --> 01:02:50,078
or separating Delta 9 so it's just

1483
01:02:48,199 --> 01:02:54,239
isolated pure

1484
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:56,920
CBD right well yeah thank thanks Alec I

1485
01:02:54,239 --> 01:02:58,639
um you know I think there c a few things

1486
01:02:56,920 --> 01:03:01,720
here well many things on the table but

1487
01:02:58,639 --> 01:03:04,358
that as we look at the overproduction of

1488
01:03:01,719 --> 01:03:07,798
CBD and we ask ourselves well how did

1489
01:03:04,358 --> 01:03:10,519
that even happen it's it's obvious that

1490
01:03:07,798 --> 01:03:12,719
it's the marketing behind it well it's

1491
01:03:10,519 --> 01:03:15,639
you know it's the trending it's what

1492
01:03:12,719 --> 01:03:17,639
information came out and was hyped and

1493
01:03:15,639 --> 01:03:19,519
you know it's a little bit like you know

1494
01:03:17,639 --> 01:03:23,598
the conspiracy of

1495
01:03:19,519 --> 01:03:26,000
CBD it's the the qanon the really what

1496
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:30,318
happened here it's not even really

1497
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:33,199
complet true I mean what occurs in or

1498
01:03:30,318 --> 01:03:38,278
may be found in

1499
01:03:33,199 --> 01:03:42,239
some um in some titrations and in some

1500
01:03:38,278 --> 01:03:44,798
instances is not true across the board

1501
01:03:42,239 --> 01:03:47,838
and of course every single being is

1502
01:03:44,798 --> 01:03:50,880
unique and my findings now this is you

1503
01:03:47,838 --> 01:03:53,278
know it's limited right it's not uh it's

1504
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:56,318
anecdotal but I work with people so

1505
01:03:53,278 --> 01:03:58,358
that's that's um quite a good uh

1506
01:03:56,318 --> 01:04:01,400
a good uh

1507
01:03:58,358 --> 01:04:05,000
cross-section and I find that without

1508
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:06,720
the THC the tfree is essentially for the

1509
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:08,239
people that with whom I've worked

1510
01:04:06,719 --> 01:04:12,278
essentially

1511
01:04:08,239 --> 01:04:15,159
ineffective um not to say that there is

1512
01:04:12,278 --> 01:04:19,000
no benefit for some people there's there

1513
01:04:15,159 --> 01:04:22,440
is but I would say it's very few it is

1514
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:24,119
very few at least in our in our uh the

1515
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:28,358
cross-section of our

1516
01:04:24,119 --> 01:04:32,358
membership and you know I think I think

1517
01:04:28,358 --> 01:04:34,960
the imbalance here is as the market

1518
01:04:32,358 --> 01:04:37,358
become as laws are written to take over

1519
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:39,559
the market or control the market a

1520
01:04:37,358 --> 01:04:43,920
Marketplace no matter what Market that

1521
01:04:39,559 --> 01:04:48,240
is um the danger is in the hype or the

1522
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:50,720
trending that surrounds that product and

1523
01:04:48,239 --> 01:04:52,118
so I mean there there's an over

1524
01:04:50,719 --> 01:04:55,038
production of

1525
01:04:52,119 --> 01:04:56,200
hemp if we look at the re uh the reasons

1526
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:59,079
are many

1527
01:04:56,199 --> 01:05:01,639
and one is because you know perfectly

1528
01:04:59,079 --> 01:05:05,880
good Farmers needed to grow something to

1529
01:05:01,639 --> 01:05:09,078
be able to live on to to gain enough

1530
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:11,000
Revenue but really CBD the the high it's

1531
01:05:09,079 --> 01:05:13,640
CBD is not really the answer I'm not

1532
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:16,760
saying that it is not part of an answer

1533
01:05:13,639 --> 01:05:20,879
but it is not um the efficacy that

1534
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:25,440
relates to CBD only um with

1535
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:28,278
Cancers even with um our unique uh group

1536
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:29,278
of of epileptic patients and especially

1537
01:05:28,278 --> 01:05:31,318
with

1538
01:05:29,278 --> 01:05:35,400
children especially with the children

1539
01:05:31,318 --> 01:05:38,318
that we work with um THC is a very

1540
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:41,639
profound part of their of the healing

1541
01:05:38,318 --> 01:05:45,079
process for them or at least to sustain

1542
01:05:41,639 --> 01:05:47,838
Wellness to reduce seizure activity so I

1543
01:05:45,079 --> 01:05:51,000
mean I think that again there there are

1544
01:05:47,838 --> 01:05:54,318
two different topics on the table one

1545
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:57,679
is farming and maintaining the

1546
01:05:54,318 --> 01:06:01,679
relationship of farmers to the food and

1547
01:05:57,679 --> 01:06:04,399
Medicine plant medicines and plant Foods

1548
01:06:01,679 --> 01:06:08,159
remediating yeah it it bio remediates as

1549
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:11,079
well so but how and and that is not only

1550
01:06:08,159 --> 01:06:13,318
food for us as human beings but food for

1551
01:06:11,079 --> 01:06:17,680
nature the planet as well and the

1552
01:06:13,318 --> 01:06:20,519
balance that we bring into living and uh

1553
01:06:17,679 --> 01:06:24,519
feeding off this planet and nurturing it

1554
01:06:20,519 --> 01:06:27,000
so it's a very uh it's a it's a huge

1555
01:06:24,519 --> 01:06:29,400
opportunity and yet we're not working

1556
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:34,760
together we're working against an an um

1557
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:38,720
an umbrella or really a a a dome of um

1558
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:41,039
kind of federal pirating and corporate

1559
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:44,639
you know the how the corporations in how

1560
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:46,119
corporations influence the laws in order

1561
01:06:44,639 --> 01:06:51,480
to

1562
01:06:46,119 --> 01:06:54,519
obtain uh complete control over um a

1563
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:58,358
product and Ma the Mass delivery of that

1564
01:06:54,519 --> 01:07:01,838
product I would say you know that

1565
01:06:58,358 --> 01:07:05,400
CBD trended to be a great deal more than

1566
01:07:01,838 --> 01:07:08,480
it is and not not that it doesn't have

1567
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:11,680
some efficacy because of course it

1568
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:13,358
does um now without THC I mean we just

1569
01:07:11,679 --> 01:07:15,038
again that's within our group we don't

1570
01:07:13,358 --> 01:07:16,639
see the effectiveness I just haven't

1571
01:07:15,039 --> 01:07:18,640
seen it

1572
01:07:16,639 --> 01:07:20,199
personally I'm not talking about a

1573
01:07:18,639 --> 01:07:22,598
handful of people either it's quite a

1574
01:07:20,199 --> 01:07:26,439
big number again it is not you know

1575
01:07:22,599 --> 01:07:28,880
10,000 people but and and and Val can I

1576
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:31,039
actually jump in on that too um yes so

1577
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:32,960
you I know I know Jason David has the

1578
01:07:31,039 --> 01:07:36,240
exact same story as well you know with

1579
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:39,039
all the PS kids that he works with um

1580
01:07:36,239 --> 01:07:40,798
you know they found kind of because

1581
01:07:39,039 --> 01:07:42,119
there was so many kind of CBD products

1582
01:07:40,798 --> 01:07:45,119
in the market that were just isolated

1583
01:07:42,119 --> 01:07:46,920
CBD you know they were having issues

1584
01:07:45,119 --> 01:07:48,760
with administering that to a lot of

1585
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:50,440
pediatri epilepsy kids where they would

1586
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:53,000
in fact have more seizures than they've

1587
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:56,798
had in recent time and so ultimately I

1588
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:58,480
know Jaden um his son and Jason's David

1589
01:07:56,798 --> 01:08:01,960
whole journey with his pediatric

1590
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:04,199
epilepsy group um was kind of in diving

1591
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:06,760
more into acidic cannaboids because

1592
01:08:04,199 --> 01:08:09,239
they're finding more consistent ability

1593
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:11,160
across batches to fight uh effect and

1594
01:08:09,239 --> 01:08:13,399
healing than they would in just the

1595
01:08:11,159 --> 01:08:14,960
batch to batch kind of isolated CBDs

1596
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:18,279
where they were trying to find a kind of

1597
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:19,480
more whole plant kind of side of it um

1598
01:08:18,279 --> 01:08:21,159
but yeah I just wanted to kind of point

1599
01:08:19,479 --> 01:08:23,919
that out um and then and then kind of to

1600
01:08:21,158 --> 01:08:24,920
the fter remediation Point um you know

1601
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:27,560
it's interesting because you know the

1602
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:29,359
end canav system is the it's the master

1603
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:31,960
homeostatic regulating system in our

1604
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:33,239
body you know bringer of balance and so

1605
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:36,880
I feel like it's doing that to the Earth

1606
01:08:33,238 --> 01:08:39,039
too where we plant it and so much of the

1607
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:41,199
Cannabis and he that we're planting um

1608
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:43,158
inadvertently is fter remediating the

1609
01:08:41,198 --> 01:08:45,198
soil and bioaccumulating all the toxins

1610
01:08:43,158 --> 01:08:47,399
from heavy metals and historical

1611
01:08:45,198 --> 01:08:49,838
agricultural compounds that are used in

1612
01:08:47,399 --> 01:08:52,039
the area thought to have you know

1613
01:08:49,838 --> 01:08:54,158
multiple day Half Lives turning out to

1614
01:08:52,039 --> 01:08:56,119
have you know decade half- lives when

1615
01:08:54,158 --> 01:08:58,000
they're in the soil in the dark

1616
01:08:56,119 --> 01:09:00,119
hidden under the ground because of how

1617
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:03,000
much they were used in the past and so

1618
01:09:00,119 --> 01:09:05,158
you know just this idea of homeostasis

1619
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:07,238
regulation and how kind of cannabis is

1620
01:09:05,158 --> 01:09:08,399
doing that to our body and in healing I

1621
01:09:07,238 --> 01:09:11,000
feel like it's definitely doing that to

1622
01:09:08,399 --> 01:09:13,119
the Earth too and so what we're when we

1623
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:15,079
talk about planting hemp it's like where

1624
01:09:13,119 --> 01:09:16,880
are we what are we planting it for you

1625
01:09:15,079 --> 01:09:18,679
know is it going for drug medicines for

1626
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:20,480
whole plant extracts are going to

1627
01:09:18,679 --> 01:09:23,000
Pediatric epilepsy kids and cancer

1628
01:09:20,479 --> 01:09:25,639
patients or or should it be going to

1629
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:28,039
grow go grow rope for multiple years and

1630
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:30,838
fight to remediate the soil um you know

1631
01:09:28,039 --> 01:09:32,119
and focus on that side of it you know so

1632
01:09:30,838 --> 01:09:33,759
that one day they can do whole plant

1633
01:09:32,119 --> 01:09:36,000
extracts instead of just you know

1634
01:09:33,759 --> 01:09:38,838
isolate CBD because anybody that's doing

1635
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:40,479
isolate isolate CBD is essentially you

1636
01:09:38,838 --> 01:09:42,479
know in a forced position to do that

1637
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:44,639
because of how much heavy metals or

1638
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:46,838
pesticides are in there you know be and

1639
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:50,480
that's beyond the just working to get

1640
01:09:46,838 --> 01:09:52,600
around the 3% you know legal limit yeah

1641
01:09:50,479 --> 01:09:54,559
it's the warp regulation you know like

1642
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:56,280
the people that I'm working with are you

1643
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:57,960
know again they're they're able to get

1644
01:09:56,279 --> 01:10:00,439
into the shallow end of the pool they

1645
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:04,079
can't get to go down to the deep end yet

1646
01:10:00,439 --> 01:10:07,039
so they got to keep everything compliant

1647
01:10:04,079 --> 01:10:10,079
and this this latest interim ruling from

1648
01:10:07,039 --> 01:10:12,439
the from the DEA is just problematic in

1649
01:10:10,079 --> 01:10:15,359
that anybody who's taking you know

1650
01:10:12,439 --> 01:10:18,479
legalized hemp which was made legal from

1651
01:10:15,359 --> 01:10:21,559
the farm bill it says it's 3% into their

1652
01:10:18,479 --> 01:10:24,000
building now as Marcus points out as

1653
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:25,960
soon as they're processing it it becomes

1654
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:28,640
again schedule one material and that

1655
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:31,800
just I think it just points out the

1656
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:33,320
inconsistencies in the two and you know

1657
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:36,079
what what I don't hope is that they're

1658
01:10:33,319 --> 01:10:38,599
given Trump an idea to throw a Hil Mary

1659
01:10:36,079 --> 01:10:41,559
here to save the hemp industry fact I

1660
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:44,880
should have said that probably um but

1661
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:46,080
you know I I I think again I I I really

1662
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:49,560
I I understand what you're saying

1663
01:10:46,079 --> 01:10:51,800
Valerie and love to be able to use the

1664
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:53,560
whole plant Spectrum if the cannabis

1665
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:56,360
plant

1666
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:59,400
teaches anything it teach tees us that

1667
01:10:56,359 --> 01:11:02,119
single ingredient medicine is just not

1668
01:10:59,399 --> 01:11:04,319
appropriate and not correct so I totally

1669
01:11:02,119 --> 01:11:06,000
agree with you and I think your your

1670
01:11:04,319 --> 01:11:08,920
patient

1671
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:10,640
results speak volumes to to to that

1672
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:12,800
point I think if you follow it back to

1673
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:16,400
its route it's really quite easy and

1674
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:18,440
simple to see you know oh how did CBD

1675
01:11:16,399 --> 01:11:20,279
get so hyped it's like well you had an

1676
01:11:18,439 --> 01:11:22,479
enormous amount of people who decided

1677
01:11:20,279 --> 01:11:24,639
they wanted to make money in an industry

1678
01:11:22,479 --> 01:11:27,039
like cannabis that wasn't cannabis that

1679
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:29,960
didn't have t HC that somehow had

1680
01:11:27,039 --> 01:11:32,119
isolated through this you know narrative

1681
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:34,920
that was created however many years ago

1682
01:11:32,119 --> 01:11:37,359
oh no this is hemp a distant relative of

1683
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:39,679
cannabis well and and Mark we said

1684
01:11:37,359 --> 01:11:41,880
before the you know pharmaceutical

1685
01:11:39,679 --> 01:11:43,639
companies have us lulled into believing

1686
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:45,960
whatever is wrong with you there's a

1687
01:11:43,639 --> 01:11:48,639
there's a pill for that and that pill

1688
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:51,399
typically in the in the FDA Paradigm

1689
01:11:48,639 --> 01:11:54,679
contains a single active ingredient so

1690
01:11:51,399 --> 01:11:56,759
bethin or B or I don't even know how

1691
01:11:54,679 --> 01:11:58,719
they name those anymore they just seem

1692
01:11:56,760 --> 01:12:01,119
like to have some fictitious name that

1693
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:03,439
doesn't I guess piss people off or is

1694
01:12:01,119 --> 01:12:05,198
politically correct but you know if you

1695
01:12:03,439 --> 01:12:08,319
listen to those commercials on

1696
01:12:05,198 --> 01:12:10,359
television it it's amazing the the C

1697
01:12:08,319 --> 01:12:12,079
commercials more about all the side

1698
01:12:10,359 --> 01:12:14,759
effects you're going to get when you

1699
01:12:12,079 --> 01:12:16,399
take this FDA approved drug well that's

1700
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:19,960
reason

1701
01:12:16,399 --> 01:12:22,920
12,967 that I do not have cable

1702
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:25,920
television

1703
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:28,920
snip get rid of that stuff wanted to

1704
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:34,119
mention that besides the problem with

1705
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:36,840
low Turks and the uh bad

1706
01:12:34,119 --> 01:12:41,079
soils uh in

1707
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:44,800
2018 less than 50,000 acres of hemp for

1708
01:12:41,079 --> 01:12:46,880
CBD was grown in the United States in

1709
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:51,239
2019

1710
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:55,400
180,000 Acres was planted for CBD and

1711
01:12:51,238 --> 01:12:59,759
the CBD percentages were higher

1712
01:12:55,399 --> 01:13:04,158
so think about it supply and demand uh

1713
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:07,800
is is a hard uh reality to

1714
01:13:04,158 --> 01:13:10,439
fight and and having absolutely no

1715
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:12,520
infrastructure doesn't help in any way

1716
01:13:10,439 --> 01:13:14,638
shape or form because it's easier to do

1717
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:17,120
CBD because all you have to do is put it

1718
01:13:14,639 --> 01:13:19,800
on a screen as opposed to actually crush

1719
01:13:17,119 --> 01:13:23,599
the herds actually R the hemp by water

1720
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:25,800
or Biologicals Etc so unless these CBD

1721
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:27,440
people invest in an infrastructure we're

1722
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:30,719
stuck with it

1723
01:13:27,439 --> 01:13:31,960
hi welcome etan and happy belated

1724
01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:35,560
birthday

1725
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:37,679
brother thank you buddy much love to you

1726
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:40,960
all great to see

1727
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:44,000
you I like that lamp ATN that's cool

1728
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:47,079
never seen that Etsy it's just a

1729
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:49,399
lampshade I was wondering of

1730
01:13:47,079 --> 01:13:51,920
course well I don't like I'd love to be

1731
01:13:49,399 --> 01:13:53,279
able to pick up a a CBD drink out when I

1732
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:55,079
was out and about but when I look at

1733
01:13:53,279 --> 01:13:56,800
anything CBD on the menu it immed

1734
01:13:55,079 --> 01:14:00,000
mediately repels me because I'm thinking

1735
01:13:56,800 --> 01:14:02,400
like is it some weird Bizarro distillate

1736
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:04,000
how do I know it's safe I mean I already

1737
01:14:02,399 --> 01:14:06,839
know it's not going to have any effect

1738
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:09,238
but you know just the idea to me now it

1739
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:11,279
just it's a turnoff I think that's a

1740
01:14:09,238 --> 01:14:13,399
marketing issue I think once the market

1741
01:14:11,279 --> 01:14:16,639
Narrows and we can trust the suppliers

1742
01:14:13,399 --> 01:14:18,279
and how the how the CBD is made maybe we

1743
01:14:16,639 --> 01:14:21,960
will be able to enjoy it more in the

1744
01:14:18,279 --> 01:14:25,559
real world assuming you can find pure

1745
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:28,719
CBD there is a use for it but I can

1746
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:32,039
mention what you do is you uh make a

1747
01:14:28,719 --> 01:14:35,600
small pipe load of

1748
01:14:32,039 --> 01:14:38,198
homegrown DC weed you put a little

1749
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:41,560
sprinkle full of the pure CBD on top of

1750
01:14:38,198 --> 01:14:44,399
it and you vape it or you smoke it and

1751
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:48,480
Wango Bango you get the benefits of the

1752
01:14:44,399 --> 01:14:51,359
THC the tpin the full spectrum and the

1753
01:14:48,479 --> 01:14:55,559
CBD kick in the

1754
01:14:51,359 --> 01:14:59,519
butt something like that is is

1755
01:14:55,560 --> 01:15:03,239
and what what what we ended up doing was

1756
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:05,239
we um we we had um really good hemp

1757
01:15:03,238 --> 01:15:08,599
flour so we really grew you know

1758
01:15:05,238 --> 01:15:11,479
sustainable regenerative organic uh hemp

1759
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:14,560
crops and so because we baby these

1760
01:15:11,479 --> 01:15:16,839
plants so well we actually um got really

1761
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:20,159
high tpes in in the flower profile so we

1762
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:24,360
were getting between 2.5 and

1763
01:15:20,158 --> 01:15:27,519
2.7% uh Tarpin in our hemp that's that's

1764
01:15:24,359 --> 01:15:30,399
great Peter what were the percentages of

1765
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:33,320
CBD so we were getting well it depend on

1766
01:15:30,399 --> 01:15:35,839
the genetic expression so you know some

1767
01:15:33,319 --> 01:15:38,079
and it depend on the heterogeneous soil

1768
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:40,279
so um and and the

1769
01:15:38,079 --> 01:15:43,399
fertilization most of our customers were

1770
01:15:40,279 --> 01:15:45,279
getting between 15 and 22% CBD again

1771
01:15:43,399 --> 01:15:48,238
contingent on the genetic capacity

1772
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:51,519
before we had to pull before we hit the

1773
01:15:48,238 --> 01:15:56,039
aggregate weren't the majority of those

1774
01:15:51,520 --> 01:16:00,600
getting more than 3% THC

1775
01:15:56,039 --> 01:16:04,279
um yeah yeah they were whenever I see

1776
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:07,120
people that had more than 15% CBD they

1777
01:16:04,279 --> 01:16:08,399
usually break to THC limits right yeah

1778
01:16:07,119 --> 01:16:10,359
that's that's that's goes to the

1779
01:16:08,399 --> 01:16:13,638
genetics of the plant but but so what we

1780
01:16:10,359 --> 01:16:15,880
did to to go to go more along your point

1781
01:16:13,639 --> 01:16:19,920
was because we had about you know an

1782
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:23,760
average of 2.5 tpes and and uh between

1783
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:25,880
20 and 25 tpine types in the profile we

1784
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:27,960
extracted those so we so we extracted

1785
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:31,639
the tpin from a lot of this hemp flour

1786
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:35,399
and then we added it to a lot of the CBD

1787
01:16:31,639 --> 01:16:37,880
tines that were out there and and we had

1788
01:16:35,399 --> 01:16:42,599
some experiments where you know some of

1789
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:45,279
our customers would give that U CBD what

1790
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:48,719
we are calling right now as an isolate

1791
01:16:45,279 --> 01:16:51,519
to their customers um with the tpes

1792
01:16:48,719 --> 01:16:54,119
added and without the tpin and with a

1793
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:57,320
lower amount of CBD the efficacy was

1794
01:16:54,119 --> 01:16:59,679
like 10x as far as the I understand and

1795
01:16:57,319 --> 01:17:03,639
that makes a lot of sense Peter my

1796
01:16:59,679 --> 01:17:07,359
question is when you did that was the

1797
01:17:03,639 --> 01:17:10,079
profile and the ratios in the turpin's

1798
01:17:07,359 --> 01:17:12,279
constant in other words from the dried

1799
01:17:10,079 --> 01:17:16,920
manicured flower or whatever you were

1800
01:17:12,279 --> 01:17:19,439
using to the finished extracted Turing

1801
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:22,279
did the ratios REM remain or did you

1802
01:17:19,439 --> 01:17:25,359
lose some of the more volatile monot

1803
01:17:22,279 --> 01:17:27,319
turpins so we we processed it room

1804
01:17:25,359 --> 01:17:28,960
temperature so that was a big thing that

1805
01:17:27,319 --> 01:17:32,000
took us about six months to try and

1806
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:34,399
figure out um and we captured the good

1807
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:39,158
majority of them so one lb told us we

1808
01:17:34,399 --> 01:17:42,759
had uh more than than 30 spikes um

1809
01:17:39,158 --> 01:17:45,119
within the analysis um and so we kept

1810
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:46,679
most of them the smell also was was the

1811
01:17:45,119 --> 01:17:50,279
same if you smelled the flower versus

1812
01:17:46,679 --> 01:17:53,319
the Turpin it was very tells you a

1813
01:17:50,279 --> 01:17:56,479
lot if the smell is the same that's a

1814
01:17:53,319 --> 01:17:58,799
good sign yeah it was the same um so

1815
01:17:56,479 --> 01:18:01,439
yeah when we took those tpin and we

1816
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:04,279
added them to these edible and and

1817
01:18:01,439 --> 01:18:06,319
topical um products people were actually

1818
01:18:04,279 --> 01:18:08,800
feeling it they were like whoa this is

1819
01:18:06,319 --> 01:18:10,559
what CBD is supposed to feel like I

1820
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:12,719
didn't know that this is what it was so

1821
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:15,480
you still got that that full body

1822
01:18:12,719 --> 01:18:17,520
relaxation joyous creative all those

1823
01:18:15,479 --> 01:18:22,519
beautiful things that you get with this

1824
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:24,920
plant aside from having the psychoactive

1825
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:26,520
effect thank you for saying that so was

1826
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:28,600
wondering what are we supposed to be

1827
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:30,159
experiencing with CBD I mean here I am

1828
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:32,760
an expert with the shop and everything I

1829
01:18:30,158 --> 01:18:34,319
don't even know yeah people don't know

1830
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:36,520
what they're supposed to feel and again

1831
01:18:34,319 --> 01:18:39,399
what we're finding is you need to add

1832
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:41,159
tpin at a milligram per cannabinoid

1833
01:18:39,399 --> 01:18:44,158
ratio so people don't even know how to

1834
01:18:41,158 --> 01:18:46,319
apply tpin yet in some of these products

1835
01:18:44,158 --> 01:18:49,119
saying oh there's Tarpin in your product

1836
01:18:46,319 --> 01:18:52,840
so what we have found in our testing is

1837
01:18:49,119 --> 01:18:55,439
that for every like um and it depends on

1838
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:58,039
whether you're doing a tinure or a vape

1839
01:18:55,439 --> 01:19:01,119
but let's say if you're doing a tinure

1840
01:18:58,039 --> 01:19:06,279
that has a th000 milligrams of CBD you

1841
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:08,319
want around 100 milligrams of tpes so so

1842
01:19:06,279 --> 01:19:11,039
that's a good ratio on a VAP pen now on

1843
01:19:08,319 --> 01:19:13,319
a tinure or wait might have said that

1844
01:19:11,039 --> 01:19:15,719
backwards on a on a Tiner you would want

1845
01:19:13,319 --> 01:19:18,840
like 5% because otherwise the Tarpin are

1846
01:19:15,719 --> 01:19:20,960
too spicy so you'd want like 50

1847
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:23,560
milligrams of Tarpin inside a th000

1848
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:26,119
milligrams of CBD that's kind of like a

1849
01:19:23,560 --> 01:19:28,480
natural ratio whereas in a in a vape pen

1850
01:19:26,119 --> 01:19:29,960
you'd want about a 100 milligram yeah

1851
01:19:28,479 --> 01:19:34,238
and I understand what you're saying

1852
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:38,480
Peter because you don't really find even

1853
01:19:34,238 --> 01:19:42,439
bread for tpping breaking much over the

1854
01:19:38,479 --> 01:19:46,479
five six% tpping by dry weight content

1855
01:19:42,439 --> 01:19:48,599
yeah you just I mean it it can be done

1856
01:19:46,479 --> 01:19:51,839
but it's it's not being sold it's very

1857
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:55,520
rare and it uh it's a lot of work

1858
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:56,520
breeding something like that that breaks

1859
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:59,920
you know

1860
01:19:56,520 --> 01:20:01,880
5% yeah and and and what's been nice for

1861
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:04,480
us is we' started to play with our tpin

1862
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:06,639
in the in the THC market and and people

1863
01:20:04,479 --> 01:20:08,279
are calling us back some of the vapen

1864
01:20:06,639 --> 01:20:10,199
companies that have that started to use

1865
01:20:08,279 --> 01:20:12,519
our turps and they're and they're saying

1866
01:20:10,198 --> 01:20:14,399
that they're high for like four hours

1867
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:16,560
you know they're they're not not really

1868
01:20:14,399 --> 01:20:18,079
high but you know four hours later

1869
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:21,920
they're still feeling the effects they

1870
01:20:18,079 --> 01:20:25,238
still have that that those those are H

1871
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:28,600
you can also dial in the Tes so but

1872
01:20:25,238 --> 01:20:31,759
you're just adding the ones that offer

1873
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:36,520
the specific synergestic effects with

1874
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:41,760
THC or CBD whatever uh I I prefer THC

1875
01:20:36,520 --> 01:20:47,040
myself but uh so that if you add uh

1876
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:50,039
Marine uh pining uh loline and a couple

1877
01:20:47,039 --> 01:20:53,420
of other ones they will not only

1878
01:20:50,039 --> 01:20:55,000
modulate it in particular

1879
01:20:53,420 --> 01:20:58,560
[Music]

1880
01:20:55,000 --> 01:21:02,198
way you like have the power to

1881
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:06,320
potentiate TC and make it

1882
01:21:02,198 --> 01:21:07,879
stronger those those are hemped Peter

1883
01:21:06,319 --> 01:21:09,840
they're they're all hemp derived and and

1884
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:11,960
we did different extractions right so

1885
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:15,279
when we used the good agricultural

1886
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:18,480
practices we got we got 25 tpin in the

1887
01:21:15,279 --> 01:21:20,519
profile maybe more sometimes in the in

1888
01:21:18,479 --> 01:21:22,399
in the other sides where where we

1889
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:25,280
weren't really amending the soils we had

1890
01:21:22,399 --> 01:21:27,079
like five so what would happen is you

1891
01:21:25,279 --> 01:21:30,639
know what what we're starting to see is

1892
01:21:27,079 --> 01:21:33,158
that it's not what one tpine does on its

1893
01:21:30,639 --> 01:21:35,319
own um but but what they producing

1894
01:21:33,158 --> 01:21:39,158
combination that truly make them

1895
01:21:35,319 --> 01:21:41,359
efficacious so how are you I have tpin

1896
01:21:39,158 --> 01:21:42,638
I'm sorry how are you isolating your

1897
01:21:41,359 --> 01:21:45,119
hemp

1898
01:21:42,639 --> 01:21:46,400
tpin so we have we have a couple

1899
01:21:45,119 --> 01:21:48,238
different ways we've been playing with

1900
01:21:46,399 --> 01:21:50,599
all kinds of different uh extraction

1901
01:21:48,238 --> 01:21:52,279
methodologies but but we can chat about

1902
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:54,920
that you know you and

1903
01:21:52,279 --> 01:21:58,238
I yeah he's he's got something different

1904
01:21:54,920 --> 01:22:00,600
Mark you gotta you got go to email I'm

1905
01:21:58,238 --> 01:22:02,158
sorry I didn't mean to No it's it's all

1906
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:06,239
good it's interesting

1907
01:22:02,158 --> 01:22:06,238
though what I was gonna say Mark

1908
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:18,800
is was touching on is this is Ian Valley

1909
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:20,440
um and it's um 68% total Tac it's 11.7%

1910
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:25,279
tcv

1911
01:22:20,439 --> 01:22:26,599
2.8% CBC F 5.5%

1912
01:22:25,279 --> 01:22:31,119
um

1913
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:33,320
CBG so but at 11% tpin this thing gets

1914
01:22:31,119 --> 01:22:35,880
me you know where I need to go really

1915
01:22:33,319 --> 01:22:38,920
quickly and I really enjoy it and it's

1916
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:41,000
actually more enjoyable on the rolloff

1917
01:22:38,920 --> 01:22:44,480
on the back end than than a you know

1918
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:45,920
something in the 80s to me um and I can

1919
01:22:44,479 --> 01:22:48,039
go back to it time and time again

1920
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:51,639
throughout the day and not feel

1921
01:22:48,039 --> 01:22:53,880
lethargic at all um so I think you know

1922
01:22:51,639 --> 01:22:56,000
to your point the modu and what Sam was

1923
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:58,359
touching on you know the modulating

1924
01:22:56,000 --> 01:23:01,639
factors of of the tpin are really

1925
01:22:58,359 --> 01:23:04,238
extremely important more so than I ever

1926
01:23:01,639 --> 01:23:06,480
thought and ever really belied to be and

1927
01:23:04,238 --> 01:23:09,559
I think you know what you you've been

1928
01:23:06,479 --> 01:23:12,638
touching on really proves

1929
01:23:09,560 --> 01:23:14,880
that that's an awesome mixture Colin

1930
01:23:12,639 --> 01:23:17,560
that's an awesome mixture out there

1931
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:21,119
there's is beautiful too it's really

1932
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:24,880
there's less than 10 Turing that

1933
01:23:21,119 --> 01:23:28,039
potentiate cannabis there's uh maybe

1934
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:30,920
twice that number that modulate the

1935
01:23:28,039 --> 01:23:34,279
effects and make it you know up or down

1936
01:23:30,920 --> 01:23:37,079
or you know those kinds of

1937
01:23:34,279 --> 01:23:38,439
things yeah the lemong G is a beautiful

1938
01:23:37,079 --> 01:23:42,319
variety I'm sure a lot of you guys have

1939
01:23:38,439 --> 01:23:44,000
grown it but for some reason the the in

1940
01:23:42,319 --> 01:23:46,359
the processing of it it really

1941
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:48,760
translates in for solvent this really

1942
01:23:46,359 --> 01:23:53,439
well um but it's a really hard one to

1943
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:57,679
work with to get volume um it really

1944
01:23:53,439 --> 01:23:59,638
doesn't you taking off S he's taking off

1945
01:23:57,679 --> 01:24:01,440
that was a cool way to do it I like that

1946
01:23:59,639 --> 01:24:03,760
go ahead

1947
01:24:01,439 --> 01:24:05,879
Colin well I just been I've been honing

1948
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:07,719
in on this process Marcus as you know

1949
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:10,319
and we've all been learning about this a

1950
01:24:07,719 --> 01:24:13,359
lot over the years and I think you know

1951
01:24:10,319 --> 01:24:15,079
um to fractionate you know is really

1952
01:24:13,359 --> 01:24:17,960
interesting to me and I think you know

1953
01:24:15,079 --> 01:24:19,920
to add to go back and look at the tpine

1954
01:24:17,960 --> 01:24:22,158
process and I don't want to touch on the

1955
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:24,600
process too much because I think like

1956
01:24:22,158 --> 01:24:26,519
you all in this room we have our our

1957
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:30,199
things we we want to you know hold to

1958
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:32,000
the chest but uh man in hash in hash

1959
01:24:30,198 --> 01:24:34,198
church we used to talk about our [ __ ]

1960
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:36,520
all the time

1961
01:24:34,198 --> 01:24:39,678
yeah if it's cool guys I'll talk about

1962
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:42,960
it so I think that that that's what it

1963
01:24:39,679 --> 01:24:46,359
under vacuum I vote we Chang the names

1964
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:48,198
to Hash secret Church yeah t all right

1965
01:24:46,359 --> 01:24:49,759
so so extracting Turpin I think there's

1966
01:24:48,198 --> 01:24:52,158
several different methodologies there's

1967
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:55,039
the you know there's under nitrogen

1968
01:24:52,158 --> 01:24:57,359
under vacuum that goes into cult ws and

1969
01:24:55,039 --> 01:24:59,359
so on and so forth and then there's the

1970
01:24:57,359 --> 01:25:01,158
steam distillation and then there's even

1971
01:24:59,359 --> 01:25:04,639
deeper things that that are mixtures of

1972
01:25:01,158 --> 01:25:06,399
all these things so you know I'm really

1973
01:25:04,639 --> 01:25:08,760
interested in working with all those and

1974
01:25:06,399 --> 01:25:11,118
and putting it back as an ingredient

1975
01:25:08,760 --> 01:25:12,400
like you all are I I but I I question I

1976
01:25:11,118 --> 01:25:14,920
just want to open up the dialogue to

1977
01:25:12,399 --> 01:25:17,118
this what do you believe for tpin would

1978
01:25:14,920 --> 01:25:20,399
be the right Avenue for uh real

1979
01:25:17,118 --> 01:25:22,439
extraction of the cesa tpes and you know

1980
01:25:20,399 --> 01:25:25,759
the lot of the monotes that we

1981
01:25:22,439 --> 01:25:27,599
know that transform and and as they dry

1982
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:29,719
how do we create these experiences

1983
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:32,520
because it's a very different case

1984
01:25:29,719 --> 01:25:34,560
structure on my palette when I smoke

1985
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:36,719
flour because it's cured turpins and

1986
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:38,800
they're different types of turpins right

1987
01:25:36,719 --> 01:25:41,840
when we're extracting it mostly it's it

1988
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:43,520
for me it's fresh material it's live and

1989
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:45,920
I'm getting a very specific type of

1990
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:47,360
tpine so I just I want to open up the

1991
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:48,639
idea that you know what are your

1992
01:25:47,359 --> 01:25:51,198
thoughts on these different types of

1993
01:25:48,639 --> 01:25:53,600
tpin and how they can be utilized

1994
01:25:51,198 --> 01:25:55,919
together um to create these experiences

1995
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:57,760
that are more Prof found and closer to

1996
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:59,560
the relationships that we have

1997
01:25:57,760 --> 01:26:03,280
throughout the plant's life cycle if you

1998
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:07,080
will well I found the monot Turin were

1999
01:26:03,279 --> 01:26:10,519
much more uh appropriate for both

2000
01:26:07,079 --> 01:26:14,039
modulation and especially uh uh

2001
01:26:10,520 --> 01:26:18,600
potentiation but uh yeah what what is

2002
01:26:14,039 --> 01:26:23,039
Marine is that is is that a monot turine

2003
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:27,000
mark yes yes yes yes and merine is kind

2004
01:26:23,039 --> 01:26:30,319
of like like the way cbga is kind of

2005
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:32,600
like the mother I understand exactly

2006
01:26:30,319 --> 01:26:36,238
avonoids merine is kind of like the

2007
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:39,119
mother of all turpins so usually things

2008
01:26:36,238 --> 01:26:41,638
that are rich with mercine are rich with

2009
01:26:39,118 --> 01:26:44,198
the other monoterpenoids that merine can

2010
01:26:41,639 --> 01:26:46,159
easily be rearranged to and that other

2011
01:26:44,198 --> 01:26:49,158
one was that that

2012
01:26:46,158 --> 01:26:52,238
hashen uh tpine right the degradation

2013
01:26:49,158 --> 01:26:54,359
turpine that they find in in hash and

2014
01:26:52,238 --> 01:26:58,959
that that's just one of them right don't

2015
01:26:54,359 --> 01:27:02,279
know anybody who smoked hashen with THC

2016
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:03,760
to report what it does to THC didn't

2017
01:27:02,279 --> 01:27:07,000
those guys I thought those at that

2018
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:07,000
Italian group did

2019
01:27:07,319 --> 01:27:12,880
that not that I know they didn't smoke

2020
01:27:09,880 --> 01:27:14,639
it with pure hash well I guess the point

2021
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:18,600
is is that if you're smoking if you're

2022
01:27:14,639 --> 01:27:20,440
smoking old hash aged hash with a lot of

2023
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:23,679
crust on the outside you're probably

2024
01:27:20,439 --> 01:27:26,759
smoking some hashen that may be true but

2025
01:27:23,679 --> 01:27:28,880
that's not science that's just

2026
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:31,239
speculation we could do that on well

2027
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:35,279
here we like to do a mixture of Science

2028
01:27:31,238 --> 01:27:38,000
and speculation yeah [ __ ] yes we do

2029
01:27:35,279 --> 01:27:41,840
specu science here

2030
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:43,639
exactly exactly [ __ ] not exactly I do

2031
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:45,279
have some uh 10-year-old hash sitting

2032
01:27:43,639 --> 01:27:47,800
here that's pretty crusty on the outside

2033
01:27:45,279 --> 01:27:50,479
I could do a little experiment I guess I

2034
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:52,639
remember we smoked some in pton Marcus

2035
01:27:50,479 --> 01:27:54,678
that was that that same stuff it

2036
01:27:52,639 --> 01:27:57,000
probably was did it taste like

2037
01:27:54,679 --> 01:27:59,880
perfume I don't remember but I was just

2038
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:01,319
super lit I remember that uh walking

2039
01:27:59,880 --> 01:28:03,440
looking out looking out the mountains

2040
01:28:01,319 --> 01:28:05,840
with you it's got the craziest tur

2041
01:28:03,439 --> 01:28:08,479
profile that I've never like I when I

2042
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:09,960
first started smoking it because I I had

2043
01:28:08,479 --> 01:28:11,559
a bunch of it and I broke it up in a

2044
01:28:09,960 --> 01:28:12,920
bunch of different ways and put it in a

2045
01:28:11,560 --> 01:28:14,480
bunch of different spots and I just

2046
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:16,520
wanted to see how it preserved

2047
01:28:14,479 --> 01:28:18,599
differently but the one that seemed to

2048
01:28:16,520 --> 01:28:20,639
preserve the most unique just hardened

2049
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:23,520
over completely and then this goo in the

2050
01:28:20,639 --> 01:28:26,840
middle just has this like almost Mendo

2051
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:29,199
breath like perfume taste to it it's

2052
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:34,600
it's insane when you exhale

2053
01:28:29,198 --> 01:28:34,599
it yes see you got wine and just

2054
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:40,079
likees go ahead Valerie go ahead Valerie

2055
01:28:38,198 --> 01:28:43,559
excuse me Mark um are are any of you

2056
01:28:40,079 --> 01:28:46,519
working with flavonoid their antioxidant

2057
01:28:43,560 --> 01:28:50,800
um capabilities and the capacity for

2058
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:54,800
that yeah there's 21 flavonoids found in

2059
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:57,560
cannabis or 23 and uh

2060
01:28:54,800 --> 01:29:01,679
I was going to explore them just like we

2061
01:28:57,560 --> 01:29:04,880
did with Turin 25 years ago but what I

2062
01:29:01,679 --> 01:29:07,960
found out was that flavonoids when you

2063
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:11,359
smoke them if you take them orally

2064
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:13,920
they're active if you smoke them they

2065
01:29:11,359 --> 01:29:17,599
deactivates them and they're not

2066
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:23,399
contributing to the uh subjective

2067
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:23,400
effects of THC which is my interest

2068
01:29:24,479 --> 01:29:32,000
are they affected then by

2069
01:29:27,719 --> 01:29:34,719
um in extraction

2070
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:36,840
like can for second just ask the

2071
01:29:34,719 --> 01:29:40,439
question they're not thermally

2072
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:44,520
stable are they affected by

2073
01:29:40,439 --> 01:29:47,118
low olive oil extraction yes same way

2074
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:49,040
they are yes absolutely yeah there like

2075
01:29:47,118 --> 01:29:51,399
Mark was about to J Mark why don't you

2076
01:29:49,039 --> 01:29:55,800
chime in

2077
01:29:51,399 --> 01:29:57,439
and so so they um so most of them are

2078
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:59,440
what are called glycosides and what

2079
01:29:57,439 --> 01:30:01,519
glycosides are they're two portions to

2080
01:29:59,439 --> 01:30:03,759
the molecule there's sort of like a

2081
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:05,480
turpenoid portion to the molecule and

2082
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:07,960
there's kind of like a sugar portion

2083
01:30:05,479 --> 01:30:10,158
molecule and these things are absolutely

2084
01:30:07,960 --> 01:30:12,920
thermally unstable in fact I think

2085
01:30:10,158 --> 01:30:15,879
they're part of the components that make

2086
01:30:12,920 --> 01:30:17,600
distillate like orange and dark red and

2087
01:30:15,880 --> 01:30:19,760
like when you see some of those dark

2088
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:21,840
colors in there and the one thing about

2089
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:24,639
flavonoids is that they really have

2090
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:27,279
what's called a a high

2091
01:30:24,639 --> 01:30:30,079
coefficient which means that a little

2092
01:30:27,279 --> 01:30:33,920
bit of the compound goes a long way in

2093
01:30:30,079 --> 01:30:36,198
terms of imparting color into it so what

2094
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:39,359
I do know is that they are thermally

2095
01:30:36,198 --> 01:30:42,919
unstable so any process that applies

2096
01:30:39,359 --> 01:30:46,839
heat to an extract will degrade those

2097
01:30:42,920 --> 01:30:50,840
compounds and and I've seen we've uh

2098
01:30:46,840 --> 01:30:53,719
seen them in our chromatography come

2099
01:30:50,840 --> 01:30:55,199
after the canono and typically what that

2100
01:30:53,719 --> 01:30:57,600
means means is that they're really

2101
01:30:55,198 --> 01:31:00,279
really polar this is just on normal

2102
01:30:57,600 --> 01:31:03,400
phase chromatography just you know flash

2103
01:31:00,279 --> 01:31:06,359
chromatography on the bench and uh

2104
01:31:03,399 --> 01:31:08,559
there's just a mixture of of uh many

2105
01:31:06,359 --> 01:31:12,118
many different compounds at least we

2106
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:14,679
found um

2107
01:31:12,118 --> 01:31:17,439
so temperature room temperature is the

2108
01:31:14,679 --> 01:31:19,760
key with the tpes what's that the I'm

2109
01:31:17,439 --> 01:31:22,678
sorry temperature yeah room temperature

2110
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:25,480
processing right um with with a multip

2111
01:31:22,679 --> 01:31:28,480
step distillation process is is is key

2112
01:31:25,479 --> 01:31:30,759
to to keeping the Integrity of all of

2113
01:31:28,479 --> 01:31:33,000
those those little guys I agree so if

2114
01:31:30,760 --> 01:31:33,760
you had some sort of methodology then

2115
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:36,679
that

2116
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:39,920
could actually then heat from its stable

2117
01:31:36,679 --> 01:31:42,480
point to the vaporization of cannabis

2118
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:46,560
could there be a vaporization intake

2119
01:31:42,479 --> 01:31:46,559
that way as opposed to a flash

2120
01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:52,000
heat it's interesting thought um I just

2121
01:31:50,439 --> 01:31:54,638
don't

2122
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:58,880
think I could be wrong I don't think you

2123
01:31:54,639 --> 01:31:58,880
can distill them I think they thermally

2124
01:31:59,198 --> 01:32:05,198
degrade again when abouts when you talk

2125
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:07,639
about flavonoids is a very general class

2126
01:32:05,198 --> 01:32:10,960
of compounds but the ones that are found

2127
01:32:07,639 --> 01:32:13,800
in in cannabis for the most part are

2128
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:17,960
gdes and typically you can't distill

2129
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:20,279
those typically so well the thing I run

2130
01:32:17,960 --> 01:32:22,359
into mostly is I at least in the state

2131
01:32:20,279 --> 01:32:24,639
I'm in with the license that I'm a part

2132
01:32:22,359 --> 01:32:26,960
of is um we don't have anyone that can

2133
01:32:24,639 --> 01:32:28,239
really test for them um on the hemp side

2134
01:32:26,960 --> 01:32:31,118
there's there's someone in Florida that

2135
01:32:28,238 --> 01:32:35,079
you can send your send your material to

2136
01:32:31,118 --> 01:32:36,920
but it's it's really difficult I mean to

2137
01:32:35,079 --> 01:32:38,439
you know I'm asking questions that no

2138
01:32:36,920 --> 01:32:41,118
one has the equipment to give me answers

2139
01:32:38,439 --> 01:32:43,559
for or with you know so it's it's really

2140
01:32:41,118 --> 01:32:46,599
hard it's very limited in terms of what

2141
01:32:43,560 --> 01:32:49,000
we can actually learn at least for me

2142
01:32:46,600 --> 01:32:50,440
well uh that's that's kind of true and

2143
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,639
kind of not I mean if do you have access

2144
01:32:50,439 --> 01:32:54,879
to

2145
01:32:51,639 --> 01:32:57,000
hlc um well the labs I work with in the

2146
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:58,880
state of Massachusetts only go so far

2147
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:01,439
there's three labs in the total State

2148
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:03,880
it's it's hard I'm you got to have an

2149
01:33:01,439 --> 01:33:07,039
hlc in your lab Colin you should have

2150
01:33:03,880 --> 01:33:10,960
one that you can just do your art R&amp;D

2151
01:33:07,039 --> 01:33:13,359
routine research with so you can answer

2152
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:15,319
question for yourself when I get we're

2153
01:33:13,359 --> 01:33:17,118
in the midst of it's a big conversation

2154
01:33:15,319 --> 01:33:19,599
but yes it's coming it's coming it's

2155
01:33:17,118 --> 01:33:23,198
just it's been a slow burn for a lot of

2156
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:25,239
reasons but um the common flavonoids I

2157
01:33:23,198 --> 01:33:28,279
do believe that there's hlc standards

2158
01:33:25,238 --> 01:33:30,599
for him so you can actually develop

2159
01:33:28,279 --> 01:33:32,399
analytical and follow up with me we can

2160
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:34,199
talk about it offline if you want I I

2161
01:33:32,399 --> 01:33:35,799
will absolutely that would be awesome um

2162
01:33:34,198 --> 01:33:37,960
but Valerie brought up a good point you

2163
01:33:35,800 --> 01:33:40,199
know the flavenoids are really important

2164
01:33:37,960 --> 01:33:41,920
um in a plethora of ways and I think

2165
01:33:40,198 --> 01:33:43,399
they're really interesting to me it's

2166
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:44,560
just it's it's cool that you brought

2167
01:33:43,399 --> 01:33:46,479
that up because it's something it's a

2168
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:50,080
conversation I have with myself

2169
01:33:46,479 --> 01:33:54,638
often oh I so then there has to be a way

2170
01:33:50,079 --> 01:33:58,198
to um retain flavonoids

2171
01:33:54,639 --> 01:34:00,560
you know aside from chewing on a bud um

2172
01:33:58,198 --> 01:34:03,279
yeah so there has to be a way to retain

2173
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:05,480
them if any of you explored that um

2174
01:34:03,279 --> 01:34:09,118
opportunity does does Flash freezing

2175
01:34:05,479 --> 01:34:09,118
help or does that destroy or

2176
01:34:09,279 --> 01:34:12,880
shatter no but I I think she brought up

2177
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:15,119
a good point I think just what about

2178
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:17,359
just room temperature juicing yeah

2179
01:34:15,118 --> 01:34:19,559
exactly well juicing juicing is

2180
01:34:17,359 --> 01:34:22,439
obviously a great way to do it it's

2181
01:34:19,560 --> 01:34:25,239
cumbersome and of course not available

2182
01:34:22,439 --> 01:34:27,678
to the majority of people I would say

2183
01:34:25,238 --> 01:34:31,118
right especially people who are ill who

2184
01:34:27,679 --> 01:34:35,639
cannot either wait to grow a

2185
01:34:31,118 --> 01:34:39,359
plant um so it' be good to you know

2186
01:34:35,639 --> 01:34:41,719
to and then of course freeze and sell

2187
01:34:39,359 --> 01:34:43,880
something or give it away either because

2188
01:34:41,719 --> 01:34:48,000
of the dangers that are associated with

2189
01:34:43,880 --> 01:34:50,880
that and Mark are the flavonoids water

2190
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:52,279
soluble uh actually some of them are but

2191
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:54,639
they won't they're not very water

2192
01:34:52,279 --> 01:34:57,238
soluble what they will create is an

2193
01:34:54,639 --> 01:34:59,440
Emulsion because there's kind of like a

2194
01:34:57,238 --> 01:35:01,399
carbohydrate portion of the molecule

2195
01:34:59,439 --> 01:35:03,559
that's water soluble but then there's a

2196
01:35:01,399 --> 01:35:06,079
turpenoid portion which is more

2197
01:35:03,560 --> 01:35:08,199
hydrocarbon like so it would create like

2198
01:35:06,079 --> 01:35:14,000
a soap you know it would create like an

2199
01:35:08,198 --> 01:35:15,719
Emulsion so kind of yes and no but um I

2200
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:18,719
I think the the the other interesting

2201
01:35:15,719 --> 01:35:22,279
aspect about it is that as cannabis ages

2202
01:35:18,719 --> 01:35:24,960
you know um flavonoids are uh

2203
01:35:22,279 --> 01:35:29,519
antioxidants and I believe that they do

2204
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:33,279
have some role in our food and our diet

2205
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:36,320
to act as antioxidants right now

2206
01:35:33,279 --> 01:35:39,118
obviously we don't consume most of our

2207
01:35:36,319 --> 01:35:42,559
antioxidants in our diet by smoking them

2208
01:35:39,118 --> 01:35:45,238
we eat them right so um so juicing makes

2209
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:48,199
a lot of sense on that level is right I

2210
01:35:45,238 --> 01:35:50,599
mean that's why the raw food it's

2211
01:35:48,198 --> 01:35:54,158
flavonoids are an important part of the

2212
01:35:50,600 --> 01:35:57,119
antioxidant cult personal culture

2213
01:35:54,158 --> 01:35:59,960
so I me it just seems sensible to figure

2214
01:35:57,118 --> 01:36:02,880
out a way to provide them for people who

2215
01:35:59,960 --> 01:36:06,000
cannot access them in the way that we

2216
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:06,719
normally or so uh whether it's socially

2217
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:10,760
or

2218
01:36:06,719 --> 01:36:12,840
medically uh what sort of juicer do you

2219
01:36:10,760 --> 01:36:14,679
recommend for someone to use because I

2220
01:36:12,840 --> 01:36:17,000
figure you probably need a little more

2221
01:36:14,679 --> 01:36:18,719
industrial strength you know using to

2222
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:21,479
work with hemp it can destroy

2223
01:36:18,719 --> 01:36:23,840
conventional Machinery so I I what type

2224
01:36:21,479 --> 01:36:25,919
of juicer do you use Valerie and what do

2225
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:27,480
you everybody recommend for the people

2226
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:29,679
who are watching a

2227
01:36:27,479 --> 01:36:31,718
Norwalk yeah get a

2228
01:36:29,679 --> 01:36:35,679
Norwalk I would

2229
01:36:31,719 --> 01:36:38,359
agree I H norwalk's incredible it has

2230
01:36:35,679 --> 01:36:41,800
the is there a particular model or is it

2231
01:36:38,359 --> 01:36:43,799
just known as Norwalk um let's just see

2232
01:36:41,800 --> 01:36:46,600
I don't even know what mine is it has a

2233
01:36:43,800 --> 01:36:48,199
hydraulic press built into

2234
01:36:46,600 --> 01:36:51,000
it

2235
01:36:48,198 --> 01:36:54,399
whoa it's

2236
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:58,439
expensive I figured so excellent

2237
01:36:54,399 --> 01:37:03,638
machines yeah it's the part of the whole

2238
01:36:58,439 --> 01:37:06,439
I think Gerson Gerson Therapy um there

2239
01:37:03,639 --> 01:37:06,440
Gerson also has

2240
01:37:07,880 --> 01:37:13,679
a and um but the Norwalk Juicer is

2241
01:37:11,079 --> 01:37:16,039
generally the one that's what it has a

2242
01:37:13,679 --> 01:37:18,719
hydraulic press and I think some of a

2243
01:37:16,039 --> 01:37:21,198
like a Vortex cutter something like that

2244
01:37:18,719 --> 01:37:23,560
that they they talk about but it's um

2245
01:37:21,198 --> 01:37:26,238
and then you know they're expensive so

2246
01:37:23,560 --> 01:37:28,800
so you there are other there are

2247
01:37:26,238 --> 01:37:32,238
alternatives I don't really know what is

2248
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:35,400
comparable to it but they do it is

2249
01:37:32,238 --> 01:37:38,599
supposed to be the premium juicer what

2250
01:37:35,399 --> 01:37:41,799
what does a Norwalk cost on average um

2251
01:37:38,600 --> 01:37:43,920
it was like 500 bucks or something yeah

2252
01:37:41,800 --> 01:37:47,119
around there years ago you can get more

2253
01:37:43,920 --> 01:37:51,158
expensive ones but yeah yeah there's

2254
01:37:47,118 --> 01:37:54,198
$5,000 Norwalk juicers just yeah but

2255
01:37:51,158 --> 01:37:57,039
those are big industrial machines not as

2256
01:37:54,198 --> 01:38:00,519
big as you'd think well I mean they're

2257
01:37:57,039 --> 01:38:04,000
around a grand or so I

2258
01:38:00,520 --> 01:38:06,719
mean yeah I I haven't bought one for 35

2259
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:08,118
or 40 years so there's there's one on

2260
01:38:06,719 --> 01:38:10,158
there there you'll always find one on

2261
01:38:08,118 --> 01:38:11,920
eBay for 500 but I don't think you're

2262
01:38:10,158 --> 01:38:14,439
you know you're gonna find it I think

2263
01:38:11,920 --> 01:38:16,960
they're probably more like a thousand to

2264
01:38:14,439 --> 01:38:20,279
2,000 somewhere in there and you have

2265
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:24,439
there is a moneyback guarantee but yeah

2266
01:38:20,279 --> 01:38:28,000
if you're going to use it and uh it it's

2267
01:38:24,439 --> 01:38:30,919
it's a really hard good quality machine

2268
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:35,158
but would be tough to find a better

2269
01:38:30,920 --> 01:38:35,158
one um wonder what

2270
01:38:35,719 --> 01:38:40,719
alternatives now what about fresh

2271
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:42,679
pressing I mean we've talked too you

2272
01:38:40,719 --> 01:38:44,439
know we've talked about juicing but what

2273
01:38:42,679 --> 01:38:47,000
about pressing I'm not talking like

2274
01:38:44,439 --> 01:38:51,000
rosin pressing but is there a way to

2275
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:54,560
cold press uh the Cannabis in a way that

2276
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:57,479
would be worthy

2277
01:38:54,560 --> 01:38:59,159
H sure must

2278
01:38:57,479 --> 01:39:02,198
be

2279
01:38:59,158 --> 01:39:05,118
Doc I have no idea I mean I would think

2280
01:39:02,198 --> 01:39:07,919
yes I mean you're talking like cold

2281
01:39:05,118 --> 01:39:12,039
pressed olive oil like that kind of

2282
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:13,679
processing yeah I mean um it's just it

2283
01:39:12,039 --> 01:39:15,880
it's almost it almost gets into the

2284
01:39:13,679 --> 01:39:18,800
rosin category right because if you're

2285
01:39:15,880 --> 01:39:20,079
actually you know squeezing the plant

2286
01:39:18,800 --> 01:39:23,560
aren't you going to like sort of like

2287
01:39:20,079 --> 01:39:26,639
thermally extrude the the oil I I I I

2288
01:39:23,560 --> 01:39:27,960
have I have no idea I I I you know can't

2289
01:39:26,639 --> 01:39:30,800
com if you're worried about the

2290
01:39:27,960 --> 01:39:35,960
temperatures Mark you could freeze it

2291
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:38,599
overnight first then put it through that

2292
01:39:35,960 --> 01:39:40,800
machine yeah I mean I'm I'm still my

2293
01:39:38,599 --> 01:39:42,719
mind was stuck on our last conversation

2294
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:45,400
about flavonoids I was thinking more

2295
01:39:42,719 --> 01:39:47,800
like along the lines of what type of

2296
01:39:45,399 --> 01:39:51,479
benefits do you see with flavonoids

2297
01:39:47,800 --> 01:39:54,840
where perhaps like a a water hash again

2298
01:39:51,479 --> 01:39:57,718
where you're getting a real sort of cold

2299
01:39:54,840 --> 01:39:59,840
extract but a particular combination of

2300
01:39:57,719 --> 01:40:02,000
canono flavonoids and all the other

2301
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:05,199
minor components that you could get in

2302
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:08,599
an extract like that versus something

2303
01:40:05,198 --> 01:40:12,479
where you're you know I hate a putting

2304
01:40:08,599 --> 01:40:16,119
heat on these tpine profiles because

2305
01:40:12,479 --> 01:40:18,000
heat is just heat and air uh starts

2306
01:40:16,118 --> 01:40:20,439
roasting the Turpin and especially the

2307
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:22,158
monot turps that Sam was talking about

2308
01:40:20,439 --> 01:40:25,079
the most sensitive

2309
01:40:22,158 --> 01:40:27,920
compounds of of the fragrance profile

2310
01:40:25,079 --> 01:40:31,279
itself will all start oxidizing and you

2311
01:40:27,920 --> 01:40:34,319
it'll leave yeah when you see the

2312
01:40:31,279 --> 01:40:40,238
analysis of processed heavily processed

2313
01:40:34,319 --> 01:40:42,439
materials it's high in CES Turing low in

2314
01:40:40,238 --> 01:40:44,799
monot yeah I think I think that I think

2315
01:40:42,439 --> 01:40:46,439
that what I all that reflects really Sam

2316
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:48,679
is that they did probably a solvent

2317
01:40:46,439 --> 01:40:51,279
recovery somewhere in their extraction

2318
01:40:48,679 --> 01:40:54,158
process and during that solvent recovery

2319
01:40:51,279 --> 01:40:57,279
they probably boiled off most volatile

2320
01:40:54,158 --> 01:40:59,598
turbines and what remains behind or the

2321
01:40:57,279 --> 01:41:02,800
yeah less

2322
01:40:59,599 --> 01:41:04,679
volle know what kind of uh results we

2323
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:07,440
would get because we don't how many

2324
01:41:04,679 --> 01:41:11,000
people juice consistently fresh cannabis

2325
01:41:07,439 --> 01:41:13,759
so it's it's I have a measurable what's

2326
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:16,238
the me we measure those benefits we're

2327
01:41:13,760 --> 01:41:18,840
not really looking at it so we can't

2328
01:41:16,238 --> 01:41:21,598
exactly measure it yet I mean juicing is

2329
01:41:18,840 --> 01:41:26,279
in juicing fresh cannabis is incredible

2330
01:41:21,599 --> 01:41:29,159
it it's remarkable so and and if I

2331
01:41:26,279 --> 01:41:30,759
jump sorry sorry I was I just was

2332
01:41:29,158 --> 01:41:32,479
getting my I'm just getting finished

2333
01:41:30,760 --> 01:41:35,239
getting the hair cut at Barber called

2334
01:41:32,479 --> 01:41:38,319
get faded um so so I had a coule I was

2335
01:41:35,238 --> 01:41:40,519
really on faded yeah get faded Barber

2336
01:41:38,319 --> 01:41:43,799
Shop pretty funny mask on bro what are

2337
01:41:40,520 --> 01:41:48,040
you doing man all right I just got to my

2338
01:41:43,800 --> 01:41:50,039
car um sorry so so on on the juicing

2339
01:41:48,039 --> 01:41:52,079
part um so do Dr Courtney was my first

2340
01:41:50,039 --> 01:41:54,719
medical doctor in California and he's in

2341
01:41:52,079 --> 01:41:56,840
so many ways you know the be a big boss

2342
01:41:54,719 --> 01:41:58,439
dude on the on the juicing you know he

2343
01:41:56,840 --> 01:42:00,039
really Godfather juicing all the things

2344
01:41:58,439 --> 01:42:02,439
and you became a really good friend of

2345
01:42:00,039 --> 01:42:04,760
mine before he moved to South America um

2346
01:42:02,439 --> 01:42:07,638
but he he towards the end there he was

2347
01:42:04,760 --> 01:42:10,039
really um advocating also blending you

2348
01:42:07,639 --> 01:42:11,760
know like deaning uh the plant and

2349
01:42:10,039 --> 01:42:14,359
blending you know if you have a Vitamix

2350
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:16,119
or a ninja you know it's a lot more uh

2351
01:42:14,359 --> 01:42:17,719
accessible for the average you know kind

2352
01:42:16,118 --> 01:42:20,198
of patient with a plant or two in their

2353
01:42:17,719 --> 01:42:21,840
yard but you know very very great way

2354
01:42:20,198 --> 01:42:24,839
also to get the C can avonoids and I'm

2355
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:27,760
sure also preserving whatever flavonoids

2356
01:42:24,840 --> 01:42:28,880
present in the in the material um and

2357
01:42:27,760 --> 01:42:30,599
and since we're on juicing I'll kind of

2358
01:42:28,880 --> 01:42:32,560
back off but I would love to at some

2359
01:42:30,599 --> 01:42:34,039
point whenever um you know kind of share

2360
01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:36,199
some information on the mono and Sasa

2361
01:42:34,039 --> 01:42:37,840
Turpin to some of the turpine kind of

2362
01:42:36,198 --> 01:42:40,638
dialogue that was happening a little bit

2363
01:42:37,840 --> 01:42:41,880
ago Dr William Courtney came to mind the

2364
01:42:40,639 --> 01:42:45,279
second they started talking about

2365
01:42:41,880 --> 01:42:48,000
juicing to me as well and uh he's uh

2366
01:42:45,279 --> 01:42:50,719
yeah definitely incredible and uh I

2367
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:53,238
still follow him on Facebook which his

2368
01:42:50,719 --> 01:42:54,760
wife now runs that account and they make

2369
01:42:53,238 --> 01:42:56,678
posts every once in a while about their

2370
01:42:54,760 --> 01:42:59,039
chickens and stuff so I hope they're

2371
01:42:56,679 --> 01:42:59,039
doing

2372
01:43:00,158 --> 01:43:06,439
Welling really really brought it to the

2373
01:43:04,439 --> 01:43:08,879
Forefront cool temperatures are

2374
01:43:06,439 --> 01:43:11,198
important is the biggest problem

2375
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:12,400
accessibility for for everyone becomes

2376
01:43:11,198 --> 01:43:15,279
the biggest problem because we don't

2377
01:43:12,399 --> 01:43:16,679
know what it can do obviously it has

2378
01:43:15,279 --> 01:43:20,118
benefits

2379
01:43:16,679 --> 01:43:22,079
but yeah would a wine press work guys I

2380
01:43:20,118 --> 01:43:23,598
mean after to to sans's point you know

2381
01:43:22,079 --> 01:43:26,639
some of the guys in our lab use a wine

2382
01:43:23,599 --> 01:43:27,599
press to squeeze out material after it's

2383
01:43:26,639 --> 01:43:30,639
been

2384
01:43:27,599 --> 01:43:34,199
decarbed um and spent just to kind of

2385
01:43:30,639 --> 01:43:36,599
help it along to get green wasted and

2386
01:43:34,198 --> 01:43:38,719
you know I think that perhaps something

2387
01:43:36,599 --> 01:43:42,119
it's just like a crank that just cranked

2388
01:43:38,719 --> 01:43:44,439
down with a big circular vat and uh

2389
01:43:42,118 --> 01:43:47,319
perhaps something like that would

2390
01:43:44,439 --> 01:43:49,719
work yeah I think of flash freezing and

2391
01:43:47,319 --> 01:43:51,880
then pressing because I you know

2392
01:43:49,719 --> 01:43:54,039
avoiding the heat but somehow trying to

2393
01:43:51,880 --> 01:43:55,880
save everything possible but I mean

2394
01:43:54,039 --> 01:43:58,479
you'd need a field of that just to get

2395
01:43:55,880 --> 01:44:02,520
an ounce you know

2396
01:43:58,479 --> 01:44:07,439
um well I you know I use my Vitamix a

2397
01:44:02,520 --> 01:44:11,040
lot for just because I the whole whole

2398
01:44:07,439 --> 01:44:13,839
plant excuse me whole plant access and

2399
01:44:11,039 --> 01:44:14,880
so it's thick and it was quite difficult

2400
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:18,159
to

2401
01:44:14,880 --> 01:44:21,239
drink whole plant cannabis so my my

2402
01:44:18,158 --> 01:44:24,598
Growers sent me quite difficult really

2403
01:44:21,238 --> 01:44:28,279
so I would just put I just smoothie

2404
01:44:24,599 --> 01:44:29,920
though well in small amounts yeah I mean

2405
01:44:28,279 --> 01:44:33,880
I do that all the time so I mean I

2406
01:44:29,920 --> 01:44:35,679
really do I what I do normally is is um

2407
01:44:33,880 --> 01:44:39,319
just pour it through a

2408
01:44:35,679 --> 01:44:42,599
c and so you know the plant matter which

2409
01:44:39,319 --> 01:44:45,880
is quite difficult to digest one of the

2410
01:44:42,599 --> 01:44:47,960
reasons it's great to build with um is

2411
01:44:45,880 --> 01:44:49,560
you know just pouring it I mean I don't

2412
01:44:47,960 --> 01:44:51,679
know there's no science behind this I

2413
01:44:49,560 --> 01:44:55,360
don't know but that I really need to

2414
01:44:51,679 --> 01:44:56,679
ingest all that fiber M that cellulose

2415
01:44:55,359 --> 01:44:59,198
so

2416
01:44:56,679 --> 01:45:02,840
um but I think straining it seems

2417
01:44:59,198 --> 01:45:05,158
perfectly reasonable Le does to me and I

2418
01:45:02,840 --> 01:45:07,039
I use the Vitamix as well and it it

2419
01:45:05,158 --> 01:45:09,118
seems to work really well if I if I

2420
01:45:07,039 --> 01:45:11,118
don't put a lot of buds in there if I

2421
01:45:09,118 --> 01:45:13,639
put maybe like four or five buds in the

2422
01:45:11,118 --> 01:45:15,679
in the Vitamix and just blend it up um

2423
01:45:13,639 --> 01:45:18,840
it's real smooth and like water and it

2424
01:45:15,679 --> 01:45:23,158
tastes good so I like the

2425
01:45:18,840 --> 01:45:25,239
Vitamix with some hemp seed you know

2426
01:45:23,158 --> 01:45:27,960
don't strin the H Seed put little Tarin

2427
01:45:25,238 --> 01:45:30,519
in there maybe some some Roots some

2428

I will show you guys right now so one a

2446
01:46:18,520 --> 01:46:22,760
gentleman hit me up not too long ago and

2447
01:46:20,840 --> 01:46:24,679
he said listen I've been watching you

2448
01:46:22,760 --> 01:46:26,599
guys on hash church since the beginning

2449
01:46:24,679 --> 01:46:28,359
you've totally gotten me jumped down

2450
01:46:26,599 --> 01:46:30,960
this Rabbit Hole super

2451
01:46:28,359 --> 01:46:32,880
inspired um I started you know learning

2452
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:34,560
how to grow and had some failures and

2453
01:46:32,880 --> 01:46:36,480
then had some successes and then I

2454
01:46:34,560 --> 01:46:38,520
started like you know playing around

2455
01:46:36,479 --> 01:46:41,399
with with just crossing some plants and

2456
01:46:38,520 --> 01:46:44,159
he he he made a cross and he wanted to

2457
01:46:41,399 --> 01:46:46,879
name it hash church and so he sent me

2458
01:46:44,158 --> 01:46:48,598
this picture of the plant and he said

2459
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:50,359
yeah this is it like it's it creates

2460
01:46:48,599 --> 01:46:52,079
lots of resin and the hash is really

2461
01:46:50,359 --> 01:46:56,158
good and it dumps in the one in the in

2462
01:46:52,079 --> 01:46:58,880
the 120 in the 90 bag um and so I wanted

2463
01:46:56,158 --> 01:47:03,359
to give a shout out to Mark who who made

2464
01:46:58,880 --> 01:47:05,760
this plant which was the DNA kosher DNA

2465
01:47:03,359 --> 01:47:08,920
genetics kosher sorbet crossed with

2466
01:47:05,760 --> 01:47:11,520
kanuck cookies so that is a kosher cush

2467
01:47:08,920 --> 01:47:14,880
crossed with a sorbet to make one parent

2468
01:47:11,520 --> 01:47:18,239
and then a OG Kush crossed with a Durban

2469
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:20,880
Poison to make the other parent and so

2470
01:47:18,238 --> 01:47:23,039
this is the potentially it's going to be

2471
01:47:20,880 --> 01:47:25,359
called the hash church I just want to

2472
01:47:23,039 --> 01:47:27,359

2473
01:47:25,359 --> 01:47:30,039

2537
01:50:25,479 --> 01:50:30,879
incredible and amazing and I hope that

01:50:27,359 --> 01:50:33,799
it it it spreads all over the world uh

2539
01:50:30,880 --> 01:50:35,920
and more importantly um I hope that

2540
01:50:33,800 --> 01:50:39,119
everyone that is currently in prison for

2541
01:50:35,920 --> 01:50:41,520
cannabis offenses uh gets let out like

2542
01:50:39,118 --> 01:50:43,920
yesterday uh that is uh the last

2543
01:50:41,520 --> 01:50:45,360
prisoners project that Steve D'Angelo

2544
01:50:43,920 --> 01:50:46,679
has been doing and a whole group of

2545
01:50:45,359 --> 01:50:48,439
people that are involved with is

2546
01:50:46,679 --> 01:50:51,158
definitely worth checking into and

2547
01:50:48,439 --> 01:50:53,078
looking into and giving support to

2548
01:50:51,158 --> 01:50:57,000
because while we're living in this sort

2549
01:50:53,078 --> 01:50:59,359
of mildly utopian uh world of cannabis

2550
01:50:57,000 --> 01:51:00,760
being legal on this at least small level

2551
01:50:59,359 --> 01:51:02,118
because I still hear plenty of people

2552
01:51:00,760 --> 01:51:03,960
complaining about everything that's

2553
01:51:02,118 --> 01:51:05,078
wrong with it I think they forget about

2554
01:51:03,960 --> 01:51:06,480
what it was like to have their doors

2555
01:51:05,078 --> 01:51:10,198
kicked in and their dog shot and then

2556
01:51:06,479 --> 01:51:11,598
taken off to prison but I digress um

2557
01:51:10,198 --> 01:51:13,359
yeah let's let those let's get those

2558
01:51:11,599 --> 01:51:16,119
folks out of prison who are in there for

2559
01:51:13,359 --> 01:51:17,719
cannabis um absolutely ridiculous

2560
01:51:16,118 --> 01:51:21,000
Civilized

2561
01:51:17,719 --> 01:51:25,480
Nation and then can't stop asking for

2562
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:28,078
for more right never

2563
01:51:25,479 --> 01:51:30,479
never and give them jobs in the Cannabis

2564
01:51:28,078 --> 01:51:33,599
industry they've earned their

2565
01:51:30,479 --> 01:51:35,439
stripes absolutely it's uh it's sad that

2566
01:51:33,599 --> 01:51:37,520
there's places that actually want to

2567
01:51:35,439 --> 01:51:39,638
keep people from working in the Cannabis

2568
01:51:37,520 --> 01:51:42,239
industry that have cannabis felonies

2569
01:51:39,639 --> 01:51:46,199

working on that um and they're

2575
01:51:56,719 --> 01:52:01,078
supporting last PR project also but

2576
01:51:58,880 --> 01:52:03,760
they're really trying to put the farmer

2577
01:52:01,078 --> 01:52:05,799
a drug war veteran on a pedestal and to

2578
01:52:03,760 --> 01:52:07,679
really recognize those rockers that were

2579
01:52:05,800 --> 01:52:10,719
earned and

2580
01:52:07,679 --> 01:52:13,279
uh that farmer has and usually grows

2581
01:52:10,719 --> 01:52:14,880
some of the best herb ever right they're

2582
01:52:13,279 --> 01:52:18,078

2584

little a little Spotlight with them it's

2585
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:24,520
really appreciated

2586
01:52:24,800 --> 01:52:30,679
that's awesome but it'll take a while

2587
01:52:26,920 --> 01:52:32,960
before it gets there not this

2588
01:52:30,679 --> 01:52:34,840
month yeah Gatherings have definitely

2589
01:52:32,960 --> 01:52:36,599
been kind of put on hold I mean no one's

2590
01:52:34,840 --> 01:52:39,239
really talking about it but talk about

2591
01:52:36,599 --> 01:52:41,360
like a major hit to people who love

2592
01:52:39,238 --> 01:52:43,879
getting together and enjoying cannabis

2593
01:52:41,359 --> 01:52:46,679
together like a respiratory illness

2594
01:52:43,880 --> 01:52:48,118
virus World pandemic like not only can

2595
01:52:46,679 --> 01:52:50,399
you not really are you're not supposed

2596
01:52:48,118 --> 01:52:52,759
to even gather but you can't do the very

2597
01:52:50,399 --> 01:52:55,399
thing that we used to do which was get

2598
01:52:52,760 --> 01:52:58,239
all together puff lots of cannabis and

2599
01:52:55,399 --> 01:53:01,359
cough in each other's faces that's just

2600
01:52:58,238 --> 01:53:03,399
done yeah but you know what we did you

2601
01:53:01,359 --> 01:53:05,639
know we used to go see live music where

2602
01:53:03,399 --> 01:53:09,719
bands would be on a stage and people

2603
01:53:05,639 --> 01:53:12,400
would be dancing and yeah the whole and

2604
01:53:09,719 --> 01:53:14,078
then we had a 209 20y year overnight

2605
01:53:12,399 --> 01:53:16,598
success story where we got deemed

2606
01:53:14,078 --> 01:53:19,679
essential because we actually fought

2607
01:53:16,599 --> 01:53:22,480
back and got our rights to be equal and

2608
01:53:19,679 --> 01:53:24,960
open so that was actually quite a

2609
01:53:22,479 --> 01:53:28,039
herculan undertaking we did in

2610
01:53:24,960 --> 01:53:30,279
California that now everybody else has

2611
01:53:28,039 --> 01:53:32,439
been able to benefit from so you know

2612
01:53:30,279 --> 01:53:34,319
Canabis has been deemed essential so

2613
01:53:32,439 --> 01:53:36,960
we're goingon to use this postco to

2614
01:53:34,319 --> 01:53:39,118
actually fight back harder I will say I

2615
01:53:36,960 --> 01:53:42,599
was in the only state that that deemed

2616
01:53:39,118 --> 01:53:47,078
recreational non-essential it was insane

2617
01:53:42,599 --> 01:53:47,880
uh it was it was insane uh I really you

2618
01:53:47,078 --> 01:53:49,840
I

2619
01:53:47,880 --> 01:53:52,639
think

2620
01:53:49,840 --> 01:53:54,599
Massachusetts it's it's brutal and I

2621
01:53:52,639 --> 01:53:58,319
think that that hindered a lot of access

2622
01:53:54,599 --> 01:54:01,880
who was essential well this is also this

2623
01:53:58,319 --> 01:54:04,439
also is why you have to work hard over

2624
01:54:01,880 --> 01:54:06,319
the years and still maintain and this is

2625
01:54:04,439 --> 01:54:09,319
where the Grassroots where we had the

2626
01:54:06,319 --> 01:54:10,639
support in California we've maintain 20

2627
01:54:09,319 --> 01:54:13,000
years of working with our

2628
01:54:10,639 --> 01:54:15,480
Representatives so when we called them

2629
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:17,760
they we got responses this shows the

2630
01:54:15,479 --> 01:54:21,078
Grassroots work that still needs to be

2631
01:54:17,760 --> 01:54:23,079
laid in Massachusetts so that because we

2632
01:54:21,078 --> 01:54:26,479
saw you try to fight back but you just

2633
01:54:23,078 --> 01:54:29,559
didn't have the network that we had to

2634
01:54:26,479 --> 01:54:32,198
to rely on so take this as a note that

2635
01:54:29,560 --> 01:54:34,880
want to come online work within your

2636
01:54:32,198 --> 01:54:36,799
state local and federal because we got

2637
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:38,239
our local Authority in Berkeley which

2638
01:54:36,800 --> 01:54:39,960
forced the state to say well if

2639
01:54:38,238 --> 01:54:42,000
Berkeley's going to do it then we're

2640
01:54:39,960 --> 01:54:44,639
gonna have to allow it in the state and

2641
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:45,880
that the bay area caused the rest of the

2642
01:54:44,639 --> 01:54:49,279
state which caused the rest of the

2643
01:54:45,880 --> 01:54:51,880
nation so right we really need to take

2644
01:54:49,279 --> 01:54:54,118
Focus after this and really get down to

2645
01:54:51,880 --> 01:54:58,078
activating your people to get active

2646
01:54:54,118 --> 01:55:00,880
with your representatives local

2647
01:54:58,078 --> 01:55:02,679
state yeah no no doubt yeah it's it's

2648
01:55:00,880 --> 01:55:04,520
it's a totally different Beast out here

2649
01:55:02,679 --> 01:55:06,118
as you know it's like it's it's

2650
01:55:04,520 --> 01:55:08,639
different than the California Market but

2651
01:55:06,118 --> 01:55:10,399
I think to your point they they listen

2652
01:55:08,639 --> 01:55:12,560
when it's when it has to do with policy

2653
01:55:10,399 --> 01:55:14,158
and they are open it's just going after

2654
01:55:12,560 --> 01:55:17,719
it and putting it together as you're

2655
01:55:14,158 --> 01:55:20,078
saying I'm I'm 100% behind it I I I

2656
01:55:17,719 --> 01:55:22,800
think it's just important for you know

2657
01:55:20,078 --> 01:55:24,799
the N the whole conversation as as a

2658
01:55:22,800 --> 01:55:27,679
national conversation to be brought

2659
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:30,440
together because it's it's time it's

2660
01:55:27,679 --> 01:55:32,078
it's you know it's we need to have that

2661
01:55:30,439 --> 01:55:34,638
conversation I think that it needs to be

2662
01:55:32,078 --> 01:55:35,960
put prop to the table in a real way um

2663
01:55:34,639 --> 01:55:37,359
but like you're saying it's it's got to

2664
01:55:35,960 --> 01:55:40,039
be policy

2665
01:55:37,359 --> 01:55:42,960
driven so

2666
01:55:40,039 --> 01:55:44,800
yeah so this is cool so I just left my

2667
01:55:42,960 --> 01:55:46,439

2668
01:55:44,800 --> 01:55:48,719
can feel the heat coming up from it and

2669
01:55:46,439 --> 01:55:50,839

2670
01:55:48,719 --> 01:55:53,560

York City piff a lot um along with the

2730
01:58:41,198 --> 01:58:45,799
diesel but it's that's a cool one that

2731
01:58:43,599 --> 01:58:47,520
that having those jeans in there is

2732
01:58:45,800 --> 01:58:49,520
going to be I bet the taste is going to

2733
01:58:47,520 --> 01:58:52,159
be in just beautiful because that stuff

2734

is just legendary

2735
01:58:52,158 --> 01:58:56,879
looks like power smoke like it I don't

2736
01:58:54,399 --> 01:58:59,359
know how the hash will be on it although

2737
01:58:56,880 --> 01:59:02,239
I'm interested because the you know the

2738
01:58:59,359 --> 01:59:04,479
F1 Vigor to it and the formation it's

2739
01:59:02,238 --> 01:59:07,919
it's clustering up and knuckling up with

2740
01:59:04,479 --> 01:59:11,039
the with the white is insane just insane

2741

hay is like is tor pentalene which is

2752
01:59:36,399 --> 01:59:41,879
like the Jack train wreck Sage deran

2753
01:59:39,158 --> 01:59:43,279
cing so piff I always heard of I always

2754
01:59:41,880 --> 01:59:46,319
heard of piff from the East Coast I

2755
01:59:43,279 --> 01:59:49,279
never smell that what does that smell so

2756
01:59:46,319 --> 01:59:53,920
it's very sweet it's really it's like a

2757
01:59:49,279 --> 01:59:57,279
sweet it it it's such a int tense tpine

2758
01:59:53,920 --> 01:59:59,639
um sweet crunchberry with a haze in

2759
01:59:57,279 --> 02:00:02,078
there it's it's just it's just like this

2760
01:59:59,639 --> 02:00:08,159
sweet it's it's a very

2761
02:00:02,078 --> 02:00:12,198
unique forward Berry that in the air uh

2762
02:00:08,158 --> 02:00:12,198
yeah it it's

2763
02:00:12,399 --> 02:00:16,319
unmistakable yeah it's like it's

2764
02:00:14,039 --> 02:00:17,679
unmistakable it's it's why New York like

2765
02:00:16,319 --> 02:00:20,359
most of the people that smoke cannabis

2766
02:00:17,679 --> 02:00:22,800
in New York their taste for the for

2767
02:00:20,359 --> 02:00:24,319
cannabis is so heightened

2768
02:00:22,800 --> 02:00:25,880
uh because of those varieties that have

2769
02:00:24,319 --> 02:00:28,799
been grown in this you know

2770
02:00:25,880 --> 02:00:30,599
predominantly you know spread out

2771
02:00:28,800 --> 02:00:33,239
through the city so it's it's really an

2772
02:00:30,599 --> 02:00:35,078
interesting can culture there um but

2773
02:00:33,238 --> 02:00:37,598
that variety if you can get it get your

2774
02:00:35,078 --> 02:00:39,799
hands on that cut it's it's it's a fast

2775
02:00:37,599 --> 02:00:43,480
finishing Haze that just is just

2776
02:00:39,800 --> 02:00:47,400
beautiful it's it's it's

2777
02:00:43,479 --> 02:00:49,479
the you know I'd say it's the best way

2778
02:00:47,399 --> 02:00:51,598
yeah I mean it's it's like picked up on

2779
02:00:49,479 --> 02:00:54,118
the haze colum from what I remember back

2780
02:00:51,599 --> 02:00:56,760
even out of Amsterdam or New York old

2781
02:00:54,118 --> 02:00:58,880
school Haze and it just like especially

2782
02:00:56,760 --> 02:01:00,480
meeting the white in this one feno of

2783
02:00:58,880 --> 02:01:03,800
the three that's obviously the piff

2784
02:01:00,479 --> 02:01:07,839
heavy all day is just like you said so

2785
02:01:03,800 --> 02:01:10,039
exotically Pine Berry loud Haze type I

2786
02:01:07,840 --> 02:01:13,000
it's yeah it's new to me too that's why

2787
02:01:10,039 --> 02:01:16,118
I'm so pulled to it so yeah I can't wait

2788
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:19,039
to check it out I I was you know if you

2789
02:01:16,118 --> 02:01:22,839
if you we have to get you the piff but

2790
02:01:19,039 --> 02:01:24,439
um but it's uh it's a beautiful variety

2791
02:01:22,840 --> 02:01:26,319
I think it's you know a lot of people

2792
02:01:24,439 --> 02:01:28,198
it's very coveted but it's at the same

2793
02:01:26,319 --> 02:01:30,158
time it's it really reminds me of the

2794
02:01:28,198 --> 02:01:31,479
mango Haze that guys I think that's one

2795
02:01:30,158 --> 02:01:33,839
I'm trying to think of like a variety

2796
02:01:31,479 --> 02:01:36,359
that's accessible that people have all

2797
02:01:33,840 --> 02:01:40,920
had it's like it's like the M mango Haze

2798
02:01:36,359 --> 02:01:42,759
but a more Berry in in there um it's

2799
02:01:40,920 --> 02:01:44,520
really interesting guys I don't know I

2800
02:01:42,760 --> 02:01:46,760
think that's I'm super stoked for you

2801
02:01:44,520 --> 02:01:48,760
because the white also doesn't really it

2802
02:01:46,760 --> 02:01:50,800
could go either way with the white you

2803
02:01:48,760 --> 02:01:52,360
know in terms of of a you know the P1

2804
02:01:50,800 --> 02:01:55,000
stock but it's uh

2805
02:01:52,359 --> 02:01:56,078
and it met really well yeah it met

2806
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:57,639
really well with the white I got some

2807
02:01:56,078 --> 02:01:59,719
arms of it that are literally like the

2808
02:01:57,639 --> 02:02:02,599
size of my arm with clusters like my

2809
02:01:59,719 --> 02:02:08,000
fist right up it and that one's like a

2810
02:02:02,599 --> 02:02:11,199
more gassy Pine versus the Pino which

2811
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:13,399
is that piffin know is all big white

2812
02:02:11,198 --> 02:02:15,479
kind of cactus looking talking like you

2813
02:02:13,399 --> 02:02:17,319
know 10 12 inch col is like three four

2814
02:02:15,479 --> 02:02:18,799
inches wide in the depth and you can't

2815
02:02:17,319 --> 02:02:20,719
touch it it's just totally will grease

2816
02:02:18,800 --> 02:02:23,920
your hands completely all out it's like

2817
02:02:20,719 --> 02:02:28,198
it's Haze Grease it's a really greasy

2818
02:02:23,920 --> 02:02:31,319
hybrid nice and yeah sounds like a just

2819
02:02:28,198 --> 02:02:32,719
yeah yeah yeah that's cool we got a new

2820
02:02:31,319 --> 02:02:34,840
a new hybrid in there that I'm looking

2821
02:02:32,719 --> 02:02:38,078
at for hash too though like coming onto

2822
02:02:34,840 --> 02:02:40,719
the indoor in back a gas mask is a

2823
02:02:38,078 --> 02:02:43,078
Woodstock Pharmacy gear also thing and

2824
02:02:40,719 --> 02:02:47,078
it's called snow drift which is the old

2825
02:02:43,078 --> 02:02:50,479
snow dog cross to uh Knack which is OG

2826
02:02:47,078 --> 02:02:53,399
KB Mac and I got this one phenotype that

2827
02:02:50,479 --> 02:02:56,399
it's just absolutely velvety grease snow

2828
02:02:53,399 --> 02:02:58,839
dog forward all day and just looks like

2829
02:02:56,399 --> 02:03:01,279
the hash plant like legendary type hash

2830
02:02:58,840 --> 02:03:03,360
Mak did it pass any of the Mac tpine

2831
02:03:01,279 --> 02:03:05,439
profiles on because I I did some work

2832
02:03:03,359 --> 02:03:06,839
with the Mac I made an F2 of it and and

2833
02:03:05,439 --> 02:03:10,118
used it as a mail and it it really

2834
02:03:06,840 --> 02:03:13,078
passed a lot of the the haze traits on

2835
02:03:10,118 --> 02:03:17,279
um in terms of the chine profile um it

2836
02:03:13,078 --> 02:03:20,319
looks like one F like did that yeah I'm

2837
02:03:17,279 --> 02:03:23,078
actually the tpine haze side of the map

2838
02:03:20,319 --> 02:03:24,519
right now nice yeah the Mac only I've

2839
02:03:23,078 --> 02:03:26,479
worked with it just a little bit but

2840
02:03:24,520 --> 02:03:29,960
it's uh it seems to throw that that

2841
02:03:26,479 --> 02:03:33,039
tpine in the mix like predominantly in

2842
02:03:29,960 --> 02:03:35,158
most of the fenos so it's it's cool it's

2843
02:03:33,039 --> 02:03:37,039
it's actually pretty pretty interesting

2844
02:03:35,158 --> 02:03:38,879
uh variety I know you can go either way

2845
02:03:37,039 --> 02:03:40,920
with that one I know a lot of people are

2846
02:03:38,880 --> 02:03:43,760
either love it or or don't like it you

2847
02:03:40,920 --> 02:03:47,639
know but you remember that big sir holy

2848
02:03:43,760 --> 02:03:49,760
the Big Sir holy weed out west that one

2849
02:03:47,639 --> 02:03:52,359
I that one crossed to an OG when I was

2850
02:03:49,760 --> 02:03:54,800
back up in Humble years ago was some of

2851
02:03:52,359 --> 02:03:58,839
the loudest and and friendliest like

2852
02:03:54,800 --> 02:04:01,760
Pleasant to smoke um rosin or bubble has

2853
02:03:58,840 --> 02:04:04,480
like solventless especially was just

2854
02:04:01,760 --> 02:04:08,199
absolutely standout favorite was the Big

2855
02:04:04,479 --> 02:04:10,319
Sir holy OG out west I remember with

2856
02:04:08,198 --> 02:04:13,118
same tpine family

2857
02:04:10,319 --> 02:04:15,920
too right yeah that's that's cool I've

2858
02:04:13,118 --> 02:04:17,639
been uh I've been doing we've been doing

2859
02:04:15,920 --> 02:04:20,599
some pheno hunts lately and it's it's

2860
02:04:17,639 --> 02:04:22,279
been fun to to see the new tpine

2861
02:04:20,599 --> 02:04:24,599
profiles that are happening some some

2862
02:04:22,279 --> 02:04:28,519
interesting like Jolly Rancher style

2863
02:04:24,599 --> 02:04:33,159
smells coming out um it's you get that

2864
02:04:28,520 --> 02:04:36,520
profile out of uh actually eth jelly

2865
02:04:33,158 --> 02:04:38,078
Rancher that's the name of the type this

2866
02:04:36,520 --> 02:04:42,880
yeah it's really it's interesting and

2867
02:04:38,078 --> 02:04:45,920
then um God we did wedding cake times

2868
02:04:42,880 --> 02:04:47,639
Mac um and that that's interesting

2869
02:04:45,920 --> 02:04:50,920
because it has like a wedding cake kind

2870
02:04:47,639 --> 02:04:53,800
of gas and then when you on the exhale

2871
02:04:50,920 --> 02:04:56,399
you get the m and the tarpine on the

2872
02:04:53,800 --> 02:05:01,039
back end which is which is which is

2873
02:04:56,399 --> 02:05:02,399
really nice um but yeah that's you know

2874
02:05:01,039 --> 02:05:04,039
I've been really really looking forward

2875
02:05:02,399 --> 02:05:07,558
to trying new stuff out I've been also

2876
02:05:04,039 --> 02:05:11,679
this lemon brulee washed uh did about 60

2877
02:05:07,559 --> 02:05:13,119
pounds washed 60 pounds of it and um

2878
02:05:11,679 --> 02:05:14,880
it's it's pretty cool it's an

2879
02:05:13,118 --> 02:05:19,598
interesting variety it's it's the lemon

2880
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:22,078
G times Ken DEA Ken so it's it's good it

2881
02:05:19,599 --> 02:05:25,679
kind of brings the lemon G profile into

2882
02:05:22,078 --> 02:05:27,078
a better return for hash you know so for

2883
02:05:25,679 --> 02:05:29,760
for the guys that are looking for the

2884
02:05:27,078 --> 02:05:30,880
lemong G profile that don't get the

2885
02:05:29,760 --> 02:05:33,199
returns they're looking for off the

2886
02:05:30,880 --> 02:05:37,639
lemong G I'd say to take a look at that

2887
02:05:33,198 --> 02:05:41,319
that cross I think that's Co genetics um

2888
02:05:37,639 --> 02:05:45,279
that that makes those but yeah wait did

2889
02:05:41,319 --> 02:05:48,078
you say covid genetics yeah Co out of

2890
02:05:45,279 --> 02:05:50,198
Colorado oh nice I yeah know that

2891
02:05:48,078 --> 02:05:52,840
thought the name was I've never heard

2892
02:05:50,198 --> 02:05:55,238
yeah yeah um one of the guys that I

2893
02:05:52,840 --> 02:05:58,520
worked with at at the facility he's

2894
02:05:55,238 --> 02:06:00,598
friends with him and he he just you know

2895
02:05:58,520 --> 02:06:03,639
he showed me his work and I thought it

2896
02:06:00,599 --> 02:06:06,039
was pretty interesting and I know um

2897
02:06:03,639 --> 02:06:08,440
Jordy from the Dutch consultant agency

2898
02:06:06,039 --> 02:06:10,519
had run some stuff of his out you know

2899
02:06:08,439 --> 02:06:13,118
at will Cox and he found some success

2900
02:06:10,520 --> 02:06:15,599
with it so I just you know I'm not

2901
02:06:13,118 --> 02:06:18,118
always you know so keen on just jumping

2902
02:06:15,599 --> 02:06:20,920
in to try and stuff but you know it

2903
02:06:18,118 --> 02:06:22,679
seemed like the right parent stock to to

2904
02:06:20,920 --> 02:06:25,118
go after to Pho hunt with to find

2905
02:06:22,679 --> 02:06:27,960
something so I think they they found you

2906
02:06:25,118 --> 02:06:29,558
know two fenos when they ran it and then

2907
02:06:27,960 --> 02:06:31,319
kept the you I think they're keeping

2908
02:06:29,559 --> 02:06:33,800
number five or something like that I

2909
02:06:31,319 --> 02:06:35,519
washed number nine and number five so

2910
02:06:33,800 --> 02:06:37,760
we're gonna try to look at the numbers

2911
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:40,760
on that

2912
02:06:37,760 --> 02:06:42,440
so but it's uh it's interesting you know

2913
02:06:40,760 --> 02:06:43,800
like feno hunting is like that black box

2914
02:06:42,439 --> 02:06:45,039
you know like you get in there and it's

2915
02:06:43,800 --> 02:06:47,480
like a little bit of light it gets

2916
02:06:45,039 --> 02:06:49,158
exciting and then there's like another

2917
02:06:47,479 --> 02:06:50,359
light flickers in the the next Corner

2918
02:06:49,158 --> 02:06:52,879
over there and you're like oh look at

2919
02:06:50,359 --> 02:06:56,359
that one

2920
02:06:52,880 --> 02:06:59,400
know I agree it's fun yeah yeah I love

2921
02:06:56,359 --> 02:07:01,598
it keepers not some some don't make the

2922
02:06:59,399 --> 02:07:03,960
make the cut you know we definitely saw

2923
02:07:01,599 --> 02:07:05,760
some you know a little bit of early mold

2924
02:07:03,960 --> 02:07:09,039
on a few types that had to just get cut

2925
02:07:05,760 --> 02:07:11,159
right out even uh

2926
02:07:09,039 --> 02:07:13,439
unfortunately but we had some great

2927
02:07:11,158 --> 02:07:16,719
resistance actually showing on I should

2928
02:07:13,439 --> 02:07:19,078
share the 24 karat gold cross with a

2929
02:07:16,719 --> 02:07:22,480
On's trop cookie that I did I A friend

2930
02:07:19,078 --> 02:07:24,840
gave me an F2 male Oni that trop cookie

2931
02:07:22,479 --> 02:07:26,598
like couple years back and I decided to

2932
02:07:24,840 --> 02:07:29,880
use him because he was Powerhouse

2933
02:07:26,599 --> 02:07:33,599
looking and colorful and man the

2934
02:07:29,880 --> 02:07:36,279
resistance factor and even TP meeting I

2935
02:07:33,599 --> 02:07:38,719
got on the uh the trop cookie meets the

2936
02:07:36,279 --> 02:07:41,000
you know the kosher Tangi there went

2937
02:07:38,719 --> 02:07:43,279
back I got a spread where one of the

2938
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:46,520
largest Thro the largest yielder

2939
02:07:43,279 --> 02:07:49,639
actually is just watermelon papaya all

2940
02:07:46,520 --> 02:07:53,159
day like super super watermelon Jolly

2941
02:07:49,639 --> 02:07:53,159
Rancher forward

2942
02:07:53,520 --> 02:07:57,520
have you run the the zum zum crosses at

2943
02:07:55,439 --> 02:07:59,678
all the the watermelon stuff that became

2944
02:07:57,520 --> 02:08:01,440
the you know a lot of the stuff that

2945
02:07:59,679 --> 02:08:03,118
became the watermelon Skittles I guess

2946
02:08:01,439 --> 02:08:04,719
and all that stuff I haven't I heard

2947
02:08:03,118 --> 02:08:08,598
about it I was

2948
02:08:04,719 --> 02:08:10,158
assuming ien very watermelon esque but

2949
02:08:08,599 --> 02:08:12,679
that's what it reminds me of that's a

2950
02:08:10,158 --> 02:08:14,879
really interesting variety to R that's

2951
02:08:12,679 --> 02:08:16,319
the second watermelon turp I found

2952
02:08:14,880 --> 02:08:18,279
actually now that's I've heard of the

2953
02:08:16,319 --> 02:08:20,679
gear you're talking about but I haven't

2954
02:08:18,279 --> 02:08:24,039
tried it now I found watermelon over

2955
02:08:20,679 --> 02:08:26,880
three years I brought back a strawberry

2956
02:08:24,039 --> 02:08:29,279
fields that was crossed to a forum cut

2957
02:08:26,880 --> 02:08:32,000
from that I bred out west and we just

2958
02:08:29,279 --> 02:08:34,000
got or what was it Forum cut to yeah

2959
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:35,479
Strawberry Fields and it was just all

2960
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:37,880
day we called it strawberry Frost

2961
02:08:35,479 --> 02:08:40,678
cookies but it was watermelon forward

2962
02:08:37,880 --> 02:08:43,760
now this one the 24K trop cook you need

2963
02:08:40,679 --> 02:08:46,599
needs it's a little bit more papaya

2964
02:08:43,760 --> 02:08:48,719
friendly but watermelon same watermelon

2965
02:08:46,599 --> 02:08:51,639
turp hard to believe how similar to the

2966
02:08:48,719 --> 02:08:55,118
other one it is even for watermelon on

2967
02:08:51,639 --> 02:08:57,960
papaya like is to me like Legend it's

2968
02:08:55,118 --> 02:09:01,279
just like his Pinnacle that that papaya

2969
02:08:57,960 --> 02:09:03,319
I would always search that out and it's

2970
02:09:01,279 --> 02:09:04,840
just amazing it's a it's that profile is

2971
02:09:03,319 --> 02:09:07,279
just special it's really really

2972
02:09:04,840 --> 02:09:09,559
delicious to enjoyable experience to

2973
02:09:07,279 --> 02:09:10,800
have um I wanted since we were talking

2974
02:09:09,559 --> 02:09:13,559
about theer hunts I was thinking about

2975
02:09:10,800 --> 02:09:15,679
Sam and and you know he's probably grown

2976
02:09:13,559 --> 02:09:18,639
more plants than any of us in our entire

2977
02:09:15,679 --> 02:09:21,480
lives and I was curious to ask Sam you

2978
02:09:18,639 --> 02:09:23,440
know what varieties and what part of the

2979
02:09:21,479 --> 02:09:25,718
world where those varieties from that

2980
02:09:23,439 --> 02:09:27,558
really you that you've seen that produce

2981
02:09:25,719 --> 02:09:29,840
the right type of heads for water hash

2982
02:09:27,559 --> 02:09:31,520
and like is there any anything that

2983
02:09:29,840 --> 02:09:35,400
you've ever done that's looked at that

2984
02:09:31,520 --> 02:09:38,480
type of stuff you're talking about doing

2985
02:09:35,399 --> 02:09:41,039
it with water sifting I don't think it

2986
02:09:38,479 --> 02:09:42,919
matters though if it works for dry

2987
02:09:41,039 --> 02:09:44,639
sifting like if it's a great strain for

2988
02:09:42,920 --> 02:09:46,239
dry sifting I'm just trying to get Sam

2989
02:09:44,639 --> 02:09:48,319
to still answer your question because if

2990
02:09:46,238 --> 02:09:49,919
you ask him in regards to water hash

2991
02:09:48,319 --> 02:09:52,118
he's gonna say I'm not the best person

2992
02:09:49,920 --> 02:09:54,239
to ask that question to yeah you ask

2993
02:09:52,118 --> 02:09:56,679
them from a dry sift

2994
02:09:54,238 --> 02:09:58,319
standpoint yeah so from a sifting

2995
02:09:56,679 --> 02:10:00,399
standpoint or or an extraction

2996
02:09:58,319 --> 02:10:05,319
standpoint that that you prefer in

2997
02:10:00,399 --> 02:10:09,759
general to be honest uh afghan with

2998
02:10:05,319 --> 02:10:14,639
Afghan indicia WID Leaf varieties

2999
02:10:09,760 --> 02:10:19,719
actually uh have bigger heads of resin

3000
02:10:14,639 --> 02:10:22,400
and uh the plants are actually bred to

3001
02:10:19,719 --> 02:10:25,639
produce resin they don't care if it's on

3002
02:10:22,399 --> 02:10:29,118
the flowers the leaves the whatever but

3003
02:10:25,639 --> 02:10:31,159
you know lots of lots of resom the other

3004
02:10:29,118 --> 02:10:34,000
problem of course with these widely

3005
02:10:31,158 --> 02:10:39,719
varieties is in Afghanistan and places

3006
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:44,599
like this is that they uh they're not uh

3007
02:10:39,719 --> 02:10:48,719
all THC because uh 25% of them are high

3008
02:10:44,599 --> 02:10:51,920
in THC only 25% of them are high in CBD

3009
02:10:48,719 --> 02:10:55,639
only and 50% of them have a blend can

3010
02:10:51,920 --> 02:10:58,359
avonoids so because they're breed and

3011
02:10:55,639 --> 02:11:01,559
selected for resin and the farmers

3012
02:10:58,359 --> 02:11:03,399
aren't smoking individual plants that's

3013
02:11:01,559 --> 02:11:05,400
happened over generations and

3014
02:11:03,399 --> 02:11:07,679
generations and

3015
02:11:05,399 --> 02:11:09,198
generations and and they would Steve

3016
02:11:07,679 --> 02:11:11,279
that and then just like mix them

3017
02:11:09,198 --> 02:11:13,759
together and then press that Sam is that

3018
02:11:11,279 --> 02:11:16,399
kind of how they would well what people

3019
02:11:13,760 --> 02:11:21,480
are mostly growing and people are seeing

3020
02:11:16,399 --> 02:11:25,279
mostly today are uh poly hybrids between

3021
02:11:21,479 --> 02:11:29,279
uh wide leaf and narrow Leaf equatorial

3022
02:11:25,279 --> 02:11:32,639
and uh Middle Eastern and they can find

3023
02:11:29,279 --> 02:11:36,319
some with really nice Turing selections

3024
02:11:32,639 --> 02:11:39,760
and really nice head size and lots of

3025
02:11:36,319 --> 02:11:42,799
heads because uh I mean if you want lots

3026
02:11:39,760 --> 02:11:45,719
of hash you've got to have lots of heads

3027
02:11:42,800 --> 02:11:50,239
that's where it starts

3028
02:11:45,719 --> 02:11:52,840
right right cool Sam

3029
02:11:50,238 --> 02:11:56,678
I all the countries that have

3030
02:11:52,840 --> 02:12:01,920
traditional hash like uh West

3031
02:11:56,679 --> 02:12:05,760
Bengal uh many places in India Thailand

3032
02:12:01,920 --> 02:12:08,800
Burma Vietnam Laos all those countries

3033
02:12:05,760 --> 02:12:11,920
they all uh had

3034
02:12:08,800 --> 02:12:15,920
traditional uh integrated hash I mean

3035
02:12:11,920 --> 02:12:19,520
excuse me ganja business and they

3036
02:12:15,920 --> 02:12:23,158
produced fantastic uh marijuana at the

3037
02:12:19,520 --> 02:12:23,159
top end of the scale

3038
02:12:24,039 --> 02:12:28,719
interesting that's getting for a man

3039
02:12:26,399 --> 02:12:32,198
that's I appreciate

3040
02:12:28,719 --> 02:12:34,198
that you you mind if I ask a question um

3041
02:12:32,198 --> 02:12:37,000
Sam uh what do you know about Alpha

3042
02:12:34,198 --> 02:12:39,319
pining um because uh you in in our data

3043
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:42,158
what we see SC Labs is you know it's

3044
02:12:39,319 --> 02:12:44,319
whenever it's present or dominant in a

3045
02:12:42,158 --> 02:12:47,439
profile without mirene because it's

3046
02:12:44,319 --> 02:12:49,759
usually a tertiary tpine to mirene but

3047
02:12:47,439 --> 02:12:51,638
um tertiary secondary but it's rarely

3048
02:12:49,760 --> 02:12:53,639
like co-dominant or

3049
02:12:51,639 --> 02:12:55,400
dominant with without mirene being

3050
02:12:53,639 --> 02:12:57,840
present then we see it like less than

3051
02:12:55,399 --> 02:12:59,960
like three four per of the time you know

3052
02:12:57,840 --> 02:13:02,760
kind of actually Alpha pining dominant

3053
02:12:59,960 --> 02:13:05,800
and I had heard that that tpine kind of

3054
02:13:02,760 --> 02:13:07,520
came in through hemp lineage like do you

3055
02:13:05,800 --> 02:13:12,159
know anything about that or do you know

3056
02:13:07,520 --> 02:13:16,880
anything to no I I think uh what's found

3057
02:13:12,158 --> 02:13:19,879
mostly uh in hemp itself not hybrid hemp

3058
02:13:16,880 --> 02:13:21,920
with modern hemp that's spread for CBD

3059
02:13:19,880 --> 02:13:26,840
with THC varieties

3060
02:13:21,920 --> 02:13:29,279
uh but uh was hemp was Meine and

3061
02:13:26,840 --> 02:13:31,119
copyline I think those were the two big

3062
02:13:29,279 --> 02:13:34,039
ones right that well that's what I've

3063
02:13:31,118 --> 02:13:36,118
I've always seen myself but um yeah just

3064
02:13:34,039 --> 02:13:37,319
T pining itself is just such an

3065
02:13:36,118 --> 02:13:40,920
interesting Turing to me I've very

3066
02:13:37,319 --> 02:13:44,719
rarely seen it actually as a well pining

3067
02:13:40,920 --> 02:13:48,440
is one that potentiates THC but in my

3068
02:13:44,719 --> 02:13:51,719
mind it also makes it slightly fuzzier

3069
02:13:48,439 --> 02:13:55,000
so it's not really clear

3070
02:13:51,719 --> 02:13:57,880
potentiation but it it does potentiate

3071
02:13:55,000 --> 02:14:00,439
THC there's there's a paper I'll share

3072
02:13:57,880 --> 02:14:02,960
uh with Marcus that love shared with a

3073
02:14:00,439 --> 02:14:05,118
group but it's it's around pining when

3074
02:14:02,960 --> 02:14:07,359
together with THC helps to decrease the

3075
02:14:05,118 --> 02:14:10,238
negative memory impairment effects THC

3076
02:14:07,359 --> 02:14:12,279
as on short term and so you know yeah

3077
02:14:10,238 --> 02:14:14,759
super curious on that and you know I've

3078
02:14:12,279 --> 02:14:16,359
totally said this before you know it's

3079
02:14:14,760 --> 02:14:18,960
that equivalent of taking the walk

3080
02:14:16,359 --> 02:14:22,158
through the forest and clearing your

3081
02:14:18,960 --> 02:14:25,880
head I I I can't wait to read that paper

3082
02:14:22,158 --> 02:14:25,879
dude yeah I'll find that right

3083
02:14:27,198 --> 02:14:32,000
now what a joy it is to gather with you

3084

3089
02:14:41,319 --> 02:14:45,118
long it's been I think it's been

3090
02:14:42,880 --> 02:14:46,800
definitely some months before we sort of

3091

02:17:06,879 --> 02:17:10,959
watching and I got one of I was off and

3150
02:17:09,120 --> 02:17:13,000
the the guy that was cutting my hair was

3151
02:17:10,959 --> 02:17:14,478
actually big uping Marcus and he's a

3152
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:16,318
fellow hash maker himself that's a

3153
02:17:14,478 --> 02:17:19,318
barber also but I just thought that was

3154
02:17:16,318 --> 02:17:20,959
a funny anecdote but um but yeah this is

3155
02:17:19,318 --> 02:17:22,718
this this has been a really trippy year

3156
02:17:20,959 --> 02:17:24,678
and um and on the testing side of it you

3157
02:17:22,718 --> 02:17:26,799
know SC labs this is this is our 10th

3158
02:17:24,679 --> 02:17:28,799
year testing cannabis and uh I was

3159
02:17:26,799 --> 02:17:30,318
really stoked for for Josh to join today

3160
02:17:28,799 --> 02:17:32,438
because you know we've been doing some

3161
02:17:30,318 --> 02:17:34,199
kind of you know bit of diving and like

3162
02:17:32,439 --> 02:17:36,318
investigative journalism in a bit of a

3163
02:17:34,200 --> 02:17:38,159
way kind of um you know just you know

3164
02:17:36,318 --> 02:17:39,679
with identifying Trends as they're

3165
02:17:38,159 --> 02:17:41,840
happening kind of in the California like

3166
02:17:39,679 --> 02:17:43,599
licensed testing Market you know as

3167
02:17:41,840 --> 02:17:45,760
certain things are popping or Trends are

3168
02:17:43,599 --> 02:17:47,679
happening you know where we're kind of

3169
02:17:45,760 --> 02:17:49,519
uh you know we're we're we're in it to

3170
02:17:47,679 --> 02:17:51,519
try to help identify the issue and then

3171
02:17:49,519 --> 02:17:53,639
overcome to help our you know people

3172
02:17:51,519 --> 02:17:55,359
that we work with to to overcome these

3173
02:17:53,638 --> 02:17:57,279
these issues that we see you know

3174
02:17:55,359 --> 02:17:59,439
oftentimes coming from outside cannabis

3175
02:17:57,280 --> 02:18:01,840
Supply chains and so so Josh actually

3176
02:17:59,439 --> 02:18:03,960
just authored uh a paper we we put out a

3177
02:18:01,840 --> 02:18:06,318
public service announcement to uh all

3178
02:18:03,959 --> 02:18:08,678
the all those we serve around kind of

3179
02:18:06,318 --> 02:18:11,920
this batch of contaminated pre-roll

3180
02:18:08,679 --> 02:18:14,200
cones like the pre-rolled cone papers

3181
02:18:11,920 --> 02:18:16,280
that there's commercial sources there's

3182
02:18:14,200 --> 02:18:19,040
um there's uh consumer sources you get

3183
02:18:16,280 --> 02:18:22,519
through head shops um and so so we saw

3184
02:18:19,040 --> 02:18:24,559
this this trend in um some some some you

3185
02:18:22,519 --> 02:18:27,120
know a trend of about five or six groups

3186
02:18:24,558 --> 02:18:30,558
failing for uh Organo phosphate chlorop

3187
02:18:27,120 --> 02:18:33,040
pyos um in Rolling roll in in um

3188
02:18:30,558 --> 02:18:35,478
pre-roll pre-rolls and and really

3189
02:18:33,040 --> 02:18:37,760
quickly we identified it was paper and

3190
02:18:35,478 --> 02:18:39,799
so we started we we basically dug in

3191
02:18:37,760 --> 02:18:42,478
kind of and did a pretty wide uh

3192
02:18:39,799 --> 02:18:45,159
consumer and Commercial rolling paper

3193
02:18:42,478 --> 02:18:47,760
and blunt wrap um kind of testing and

3194
02:18:45,159 --> 02:18:50,200
report and so Josh kind of was just um

3195
02:18:47,760 --> 02:18:51,639
you just compiled all that and and yeah

3196
02:18:50,200 --> 02:18:53,679
just wanted I set that up for you Josh

3197
02:18:51,638 --> 02:18:56,598
if you be down to share

3198
02:18:53,679 --> 02:18:59,439
some yeah I mean yeah Alex said it

3199
02:18:56,599 --> 02:19:02,920
pretty good so we we had a couple a

3200
02:18:59,439 --> 02:19:05,000
cluster of of of pre-rolls fail um and

3201
02:19:02,920 --> 02:19:06,840
and we knew that the the material that

3202
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:08,679
had got into them was clean so so you

3203
02:19:06,840 --> 02:19:12,599
know kind of digging in like Alex said

3204
02:19:08,679 --> 02:19:16,840
we we we traced it back to the the cones

3205
02:19:12,599 --> 02:19:19,000
um and uh the the the funny thing is uh

3206
02:19:16,840 --> 02:19:20,880
um when when we when we went and

3207
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:22,760
actually did a study of of of multi

3208
02:19:20,879 --> 02:19:25,799
rolling paper Brands we didn't find a

3209
02:19:22,760 --> 02:19:27,920
lot of that pesticide in the uh in in in

3210
02:19:25,799 --> 02:19:29,840
the brands that we tested so you know it

3211
02:19:27,920 --> 02:19:33,478
seems like it was a you know kind of

3212
02:19:29,840 --> 02:19:34,840
it's a batch by batch um issue but but

3213
02:19:33,478 --> 02:19:36,478
this this you know these failures sort

3214
02:19:34,840 --> 02:19:38,920
of precipitated the study we did and and

3215
02:19:36,478 --> 02:19:40,760
so we went and um you know kind of got

3216
02:19:38,920 --> 02:19:42,239
pulled out any any type of rolling paper

3217
02:19:40,760 --> 02:19:44,599
product we get our hands on and I think

3218
02:19:42,239 --> 02:19:47,359
got about 120 and you know not

3219
02:19:44,599 --> 02:19:49,520
surprisingly um you know paper has Trace

3220
02:19:47,359 --> 02:19:51,840
levels of of metals and and sometimes

3221
02:19:49,520 --> 02:19:54,000
Trace levels of of P pesticides um you

3222
02:19:51,840 --> 02:19:56,920
know all these papers come from you know

3223
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:59,159
uh organic or you know uh plant-based

3224
02:19:56,920 --> 02:20:01,520
sources and so um it's not surprising to

3225
02:19:59,159 --> 02:20:03,719
find Metals in Plants um and and you

3226
02:20:01,520 --> 02:20:06,159
know there's not you know it wasn't it

3227
02:20:03,719 --> 02:20:07,599
wasn't a a story of kind of you know

3228
02:20:06,159 --> 02:20:09,280
rolling papers are all grossly

3229
02:20:07,600 --> 02:20:12,439
contaminated but we certainly did find

3230
02:20:09,280 --> 02:20:14,840
some instances of of really contaminated

3231
02:20:12,439 --> 02:20:16,280
rolling papers that you know if I was a

3232
02:20:14,840 --> 02:20:18,040
um you know pre-roll manufacturer for

3233
02:20:16,280 --> 02:20:20,520
sure I'd want to be cognizant of and if

3234
02:20:18,040 --> 02:20:22,439
you know and and and certainly um you

3235
02:20:20,520 --> 02:20:24,920
know if I was a consumer i' kind of want

3236
02:20:22,439 --> 02:20:27,200
to know um you know some of these but

3237
02:20:24,920 --> 02:20:29,079
but anyway so so um for the most part

3238
02:20:27,200 --> 02:20:31,359
you know rolling papers are were we're

3239
02:20:29,079 --> 02:20:33,120
relatively clean but um in a small

3240
02:20:31,359 --> 02:20:34,960
portion of the samples we found you know

3241
02:20:33,120 --> 02:20:37,880
hundreds of times the allowable limits

3242
02:20:34,959 --> 02:20:40,759
in California for um you know things

3243
02:20:37,879 --> 02:20:42,239
like lead um and and other heavy metals

3244
02:20:40,760 --> 02:20:44,280
and then and then in some of the Ring

3245
02:20:42,239 --> 02:20:45,639
papers we found you know enough

3246
02:20:44,280 --> 02:20:47,439
pesticide where I would be concerned if

3247
02:20:45,639 --> 02:20:48,760
I was a pre-roll manufacturer that in in

3248
02:20:47,439 --> 02:20:51,000
States like California I might actually

3249
02:20:48,760 --> 02:20:52,800
fail a compliance batch test because

3250
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:55,439
just because what were the levels what

3251
02:20:52,799 --> 02:20:57,759
the levels of the pesticide you see um

3252
02:20:55,439 --> 02:20:59,639
in pesticides so it it depends on the

3253
02:20:57,760 --> 02:21:02,239
pesticide but you know in some in some

3254
02:20:59,639 --> 02:21:04,358
instances we were seeing you know seven

3255
02:21:02,239 --> 02:21:06,359
seven or eight times the allowable limit

3256
02:21:04,359 --> 02:21:09,479
in California so if you had you know in

3257
02:21:06,359 --> 02:21:12,079
in it seemed to be um it seemed to be

3258
02:21:09,478 --> 02:21:13,719
certainly the the the one product

3259
02:21:12,079 --> 02:21:16,000
category that was really kind of

3260
02:21:13,719 --> 02:21:18,599
concerning was cellulose based rolling

3261
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:20,760
papers so um we only happen to have

3262
02:21:18,600 --> 02:21:23,280
three cellulose based rolling papers in

3263
02:21:20,760 --> 02:21:25,159
our sample size sample set of like 120

3264
02:21:23,280 --> 02:21:28,680
samples so I didn't have a really good

3265
02:21:25,159 --> 02:21:30,280
sample size to draw from um but and and

3266
02:21:28,680 --> 02:21:33,280
I can pull it up really quick here but

3267
02:21:30,280 --> 02:21:35,560
in in two of the three um all three of

3268
02:21:33,280 --> 02:21:37,120
them failed for or would have I I say

3269
02:21:35,559 --> 02:21:38,840
failed would have failed in California

3270
02:21:37,120 --> 02:21:41,200
had they been cannabis for an inhalable

3271
02:21:38,840 --> 02:21:42,880
cannibal cannabis product but two of the

3272
02:21:41,200 --> 02:21:46,840
three had hundreds of times the

3273
02:21:42,879 --> 02:21:48,639
allowable limit of lead um and then um

3274
02:21:46,840 --> 02:21:52,040
and then yeah and then some of the some

3275
02:21:48,639 --> 02:21:53,920
of the uh the the sort of wraps were

3276
02:21:52,040 --> 02:21:55,479
also kind of the other product category

3277
02:21:53,920 --> 02:21:57,079
that was um you know had some

3278
02:21:55,478 --> 02:21:58,799
significant contamination in it we

3279
02:21:57,079 --> 02:22:00,760
didn't see a lot of contamination in the

3280
02:21:58,799 --> 02:22:02,159
in the actual Rolling Papers themselves

3281
02:22:00,760 --> 02:22:03,920
the kind of hemp based or the fiber

3282
02:22:02,159 --> 02:22:05,840
based Rolling Papers certainly some you

3283
02:22:03,920 --> 02:22:07,159
know some Trace detections in in one or

3284
02:22:05,840 --> 02:22:09,359
two that were you know kind of would

3285
02:22:07,159 --> 02:22:10,799
approach the California acent but again

3286
02:22:09,359 --> 02:22:12,800
you know a rolling paper only

3287
02:22:10,799 --> 02:22:16,318
constitutes a small portion of you know

3288
02:22:12,799 --> 02:22:19,840
of thousands of ppms tens of ppms what

3289
02:22:16,318 --> 02:22:22,799
were the so what was the concentration

3290
02:22:19,840 --> 02:22:24,318
regime so the cellulose ones were around

3291
02:22:22,799 --> 02:22:26,119
I want to say like kind of I mean they

3292
02:22:24,318 --> 02:22:28,279
absolutely blew our kind of high

3293
02:22:26,120 --> 02:22:31,399
calibrations but it was I mean look in

3294
02:22:28,280 --> 02:22:34,079
exess of 50 part per million of lead you

3295
02:22:31,398 --> 02:22:35,959
know in the cellulose like clear roll um

3296
02:22:34,079 --> 02:22:37,680
type papers that you know I mean there

3297
02:22:35,959 --> 02:22:39,519
AR they're not super big I remember I

3298
02:22:37,680 --> 02:22:40,800
used to smoke those you know because it

3299
02:22:39,520 --> 02:22:42,680
was unique and interesting because you

3300
02:22:40,799 --> 02:22:45,199
could see through it when you smoke it

3301
02:22:42,680 --> 02:22:47,800
um but then but yeah you we saw the

3302
02:22:45,200 --> 02:22:50,560
chlorop pyros issue was largely kind of

3303
02:22:47,799 --> 02:22:53,639
you know within this commercial source

3304
02:22:50,559 --> 02:22:54,959
of of uh rolling paper cones pre-rolled

3305
02:22:53,639 --> 02:22:56,559
cones you know because it seems like

3306
02:22:54,959 --> 02:22:58,039
there's a few factories in the world

3307
02:22:56,559 --> 02:22:59,959
that make these you know from one in

3308
02:22:58,040 --> 02:23:01,920
check is Volo one so what was the level

3309
02:22:59,959 --> 02:23:04,239
of Chlor pure fos was that just like

3310
02:23:01,920 --> 02:23:06,799
about 10 PPM

3311
02:23:04,239 --> 02:23:09,478
orm no no no it was it was like you know

3312
02:23:06,799 --> 02:23:12,398
kind of between like three 300 part per

3313
02:23:09,478 --> 02:23:14,478
billion to like a part per million you

3314
02:23:12,398 --> 02:23:16,318
know whereas whereas about 30 part per

3315
02:23:14,478 --> 02:23:18,239
billion is a fail for a cannabis product

3316
02:23:16,318 --> 02:23:20,920
in California and so essentially people

3317
02:23:18,239 --> 02:23:24,600
are taking these you know these highly

3318
02:23:20,920 --> 02:23:26,600
contaminated con and then diluting the

3319
02:23:24,600 --> 02:23:28,200
pesticide with clean cannabis that then

3320
02:23:26,600 --> 02:23:29,680
was still kind of creating fails because

3321
02:23:28,200 --> 02:23:31,479
of how much you know pesticide was in

3322
02:23:29,680 --> 02:23:32,559
the paper you know and then yeah then

3323
02:23:31,478 --> 02:23:33,599
like Josh was saying besides that you

3324
02:23:32,559 --> 02:23:35,879
know a lot of what we were seeing then

3325
02:23:33,600 --> 02:23:39,279
was in the thicker ply type of you know

3326
02:23:35,879 --> 02:23:42,519
kind of cones or not cones sorry the um

3327
02:23:39,279 --> 02:23:45,560
hemp and you know tobacco kind of blunt

3328
02:23:42,520 --> 02:23:48,120
wrap type um type products yeah I just

3329
02:23:45,559 --> 02:23:50,639
pulled it up so um you know uh CER

3330
02:23:48,120 --> 02:23:53,520
methine was was an issue with with just

3331
02:23:50,639 --> 02:23:55,439
seemed like one brand of of wraps um we

3332
02:23:53,520 --> 02:23:57,200
had three of them and all three of them

3333
02:23:55,439 --> 02:23:59,398
hit for CER mithin well over the action

3334
02:23:57,200 --> 02:24:01,680
limit they're like yeah between two and

3335
02:23:59,398 --> 02:24:02,879
seven parts per million one part per

3336
02:24:01,680 --> 02:24:05,479
million would be the action limit in

3337
02:24:02,879 --> 02:24:08,159
California so I mean over I mean not not

3338
02:24:05,478 --> 02:24:09,719
you know I you know nothing I'd be you

3339
02:24:08,159 --> 02:24:11,159
know overly concerned with unless I was

3340
02:24:09,719 --> 02:24:14,719
a manufacturer who was trying to you

3341
02:24:11,159 --> 02:24:16,559
know not fail a batch test um you know

3342
02:24:14,719 --> 02:24:18,318
as a consumer it's not you know grossly

3343
02:24:16,559 --> 02:24:20,119
contaminated but yeah the cellus based

3344
02:24:18,318 --> 02:24:23,039
rolling papers like Alex said they were

3345
02:24:20,120 --> 02:24:25,240
um you know between 60 and 50 one was 60

3346
02:24:23,040 --> 02:24:27,279
one was 55 parts per Mill million for

3347
02:24:25,239 --> 02:24:29,199
lead and in California just to give you

3348
02:24:27,279 --> 02:24:31,239
kind of a background the action limit is

3349
02:24:29,200 --> 02:24:33,800
50 parts per billion so I I misspoke

3350
02:24:31,239 --> 02:24:35,959
they were a thousand times um they're a

3351
02:24:33,799 --> 02:24:37,398
thousand times over the action limit so

3352
02:24:35,959 --> 02:24:39,719
yeah you know based on what you're

3353
02:24:37,398 --> 02:24:42,599
telling me I wonder if those compounds

3354
02:24:39,719 --> 02:24:45,559
are actually applied to containers for

3355
02:24:42,600 --> 02:24:47,840
Pest Control you know a lot of that [ __ ]

3356
02:24:45,559 --> 02:24:48,879
coming over from China what they do is

3357
02:24:47,840 --> 02:24:51,279
they just

3358
02:24:48,879 --> 02:24:54,679
broadcast pest

3359
02:24:51,279 --> 02:24:57,279
pesticide XYZ over containers in in

3360
02:24:54,680 --> 02:24:59,398
shipping areas that again are not very

3361
02:24:57,279 --> 02:25:02,399
segregated on you know what's SE and

3362
02:24:59,398 --> 02:25:05,358
what's not but um I don't I don't know I

3363
02:25:02,398 --> 02:25:07,879
mean those are really really low levels

3364
02:25:05,359 --> 02:25:09,960
of those compounds I mean yeah you don't

3365
02:25:07,879 --> 02:25:12,159
want to see any of those things in in

3366
02:25:09,959 --> 02:25:16,079
your cannabis but when you're measuring

3367
02:25:12,159 --> 02:25:18,359
stuff at the at the part Pavilion level

3368
02:25:16,079 --> 02:25:20,359
remember this conversation Alec yeah

3369
02:25:18,359 --> 02:25:22,760
it's like taking a lint brush to nework

3370
02:25:20,359 --> 02:25:24,800
York City sidewalk you're going to find

3371
02:25:22,760 --> 02:25:28,800
everything man I mean you start looking

3372
02:25:24,799 --> 02:25:30,719
at we um looked at uh what was that uh

3373
02:25:28,799 --> 02:25:32,719
Backwoods right we went and took

3374
02:25:30,719 --> 02:25:34,959
Backwoods and found out they had Roundup

3375
02:25:32,719 --> 02:25:38,199
and all kinds of [ __ ] in there I mean

3376
02:25:34,959 --> 02:25:41,199
yeah I mean just background exposure we

3377
02:25:38,200 --> 02:25:43,399
live in a chemically contaminated World

3378
02:25:41,200 --> 02:25:45,800
Josh mean what's the likelihood that

3379
02:25:43,398 --> 02:25:48,719
this is actually either applied during

3380
02:25:45,799 --> 02:25:52,398
the paper making process or like I said

3381
02:25:48,719 --> 02:25:54,920
maybe more accurate applied in a pest

3382
02:25:52,398 --> 02:25:58,318
control kind of way that had nothing to

3383
02:25:54,920 --> 02:26:00,680
do with the cellulose or nothing to do

3384
02:25:58,318 --> 02:26:01,600
with the factory that made the well the

3385
02:26:00,680 --> 02:26:03,479
well the two different things the

3386
02:26:01,600 --> 02:26:05,640
cellulose based rolling the cellulose

3387
02:26:03,478 --> 02:26:07,760
rolling papers were were lead so that

3388
02:26:05,639 --> 02:26:09,760
that came from from kind of probably

3389
02:26:07,760 --> 02:26:11,398
whatever was in the the fiber you know

3390
02:26:09,760 --> 02:26:13,359
the cellul source that they used to

3391
02:26:11,398 --> 02:26:16,159
produce these or it's coming from from

3392
02:26:13,359 --> 02:26:18,200
you know really kind of poorly designed

3393
02:26:16,159 --> 02:26:19,799
um you know uh equipment you know if

3394
02:26:18,200 --> 02:26:22,240
people if if you know wherever these

3395
02:26:19,799 --> 02:26:24,358
papers are produced um if if the machine

3396
02:26:22,239 --> 02:26:25,600
just you know had had lead lead parts

3397
02:26:24,359 --> 02:26:27,399
and I mean that that happens all the

3398
02:26:25,600 --> 02:26:29,239
time in manufacturing it's not you know

3399
02:26:27,398 --> 02:26:31,680
that but what was the level of lead

3400
02:26:29,239 --> 02:26:33,359
again 60 parts per million that you know

3401
02:26:31,680 --> 02:26:35,359
that's that's a ton of lead that's a

3402
02:26:33,359 --> 02:26:36,960
that's a lot of lead yeah yeah yeah um

3403
02:26:35,359 --> 02:26:38,200
and but but with with the with the

3404
02:26:36,959 --> 02:26:39,799
pesticides yeah like in pesticides

3405
02:26:38,200 --> 02:26:41,439
weren't a huge issue like these these

3406
02:26:39,799 --> 02:26:43,239
three for super methine I mean that's

3407
02:26:41,439 --> 02:26:44,720
enough where it wasn't like you know it

3408
02:26:43,239 --> 02:26:46,039
didn't probably get picked up from

3409
02:26:44,719 --> 02:26:47,438
somewhere but yeah you're right it could

3410
02:26:46,040 --> 02:26:49,800
have been fumigated I don't think anyone

3411
02:26:47,439 --> 02:26:52,079
is applying pesticides to the papers um

3412
02:26:49,799 --> 02:26:53,799
you know or maybe the hemp Source but I

3413
02:26:52,079 --> 02:26:56,120
I you know Industrial Hemp I don't think

3414
02:26:53,799 --> 02:26:57,840
you know they they they they you know I

3415
02:26:56,120 --> 02:26:59,120
don't know I I want to make guesses but

3416
02:26:57,840 --> 02:27:01,318
and then we had a couple that that

3417
02:26:59,120 --> 02:27:03,359
tested positive for Chlor pyol but not

3418
02:27:01,318 --> 02:27:05,398
in the levels we saw that in in in sort

3419
02:27:03,359 --> 02:27:07,200
of the samples that had precipitated the

3420
02:27:05,398 --> 02:27:08,439
study in the first place so yeah these

3421
02:27:07,200 --> 02:27:10,040
you know these could have been you know

3422
02:27:08,439 --> 02:27:12,239
in stored in a facility that was

3423
02:27:10,040 --> 02:27:13,880
fumigated or um you know there's there's

3424
02:27:12,239 --> 02:27:15,799
lots of way these these contaminations

3425
02:27:13,879 --> 02:27:18,199
can can reach the product you know the

3426
02:27:15,799 --> 02:27:19,840
the the cellulose papers I would I would

3427
02:27:18,200 --> 02:27:22,159
say like yeah dude if I was you know

3428
02:27:19,840 --> 02:27:24,079
this this sort of a consumer uh you know

3429
02:27:22,159 --> 02:27:26,159
consumer safety issue and and and these

3430
02:27:24,079 --> 02:27:27,719
these these these particular samples

3431
02:27:26,159 --> 02:27:29,639
that we tested I you know I would not

3432
02:27:27,719 --> 02:27:32,079
want to consume certainly and I I I I

3433
02:27:29,639 --> 02:27:33,879
wouldn't recommend people do but you

3434
02:27:32,079 --> 02:27:35,959
know yeah like I said the the amount of

3435
02:27:33,879 --> 02:27:37,639
CPP methine even even in these blunt

3436
02:27:35,959 --> 02:27:40,639
wraps that that you know were were well

3437
02:27:37,639 --> 02:27:42,239
over the acttion limit in California um

3438
02:27:40,639 --> 02:27:44,478
I don't think you know by the time you

3439
02:27:42,239 --> 02:27:46,079
you put cannabis in it I mean I I don't

3440
02:27:44,478 --> 02:27:47,840
know I'm I'm not an epidemiologist but I

3441
02:27:46,079 --> 02:27:49,680
wouldn't personally be you know overly

3442
02:27:47,840 --> 02:27:52,200
concerned about this myself as a

3443
02:27:49,680 --> 02:27:54,520
consumer but um certainly as a

3444
02:27:52,200 --> 02:27:56,240
manufacturer of of pre-roll products you

3445
02:27:54,520 --> 02:27:58,079
know I think it's just something you

3446
02:27:56,239 --> 02:27:59,879
know it's something we identified as is

3447
02:27:58,079 --> 02:28:01,680
another you know another thing another

3448
02:27:59,879 --> 02:28:04,039
input that that manufacturers should be

3449
02:28:01,680 --> 02:28:05,720
aware of is is another example of you

3450
02:28:04,040 --> 02:28:07,960
know you gotta you got to check all your

3451
02:28:05,719 --> 02:28:09,879
inputs um you know with with the

3452
02:28:07,959 --> 02:28:12,159
regulations we're working with yeah and

3453
02:28:09,879 --> 02:28:13,519
if I may real quick on that um you so so

3454
02:28:12,159 --> 02:28:15,200
and just to give a little more context

3455
02:28:13,520 --> 02:28:17,359
you know um Public Service Announcement

3456
02:28:15,200 --> 02:28:19,560
Less on like public health scare but it

3457
02:28:17,359 --> 02:28:21,318
was more sending out to you know all the

3458
02:28:19,559 --> 02:28:24,039
clients that we work with in California

3459
02:28:21,318 --> 02:28:25,799
as a source that has been you know kind

3460
02:28:24,040 --> 02:28:28,760
of identified bringing in you know

3461
02:28:25,799 --> 02:28:30,599
failures you know of 3,000 you know

3462
02:28:28,760 --> 02:28:32,880
batch you know product batch you know

3463
02:28:30,600 --> 02:28:35,399
kind of you final finished product and

3464
02:28:32,879 --> 02:28:37,358
you know 3,000 pre-rolls or what have

3465
02:28:35,398 --> 02:28:40,079
you and so so we're kind of putting it

3466
02:28:37,359 --> 02:28:43,159
out more in in like an insight to help

3467
02:28:40,079 --> 02:28:44,760
kind of navigate and eliminate potential

3468
02:28:43,159 --> 02:28:46,398
fail you know and that's what we do a

3469
02:28:44,760 --> 02:28:47,960
lot of you know because you know because

3470
02:28:46,398 --> 02:28:49,039
you know across all these tests and you

3471
02:28:47,959 --> 02:28:51,438
know I totally understand what you're

3472
02:28:49,040 --> 02:28:53,760
saying Mark you know like there's such

3473
02:28:51,439 --> 02:28:55,760
tiny action limits but you know you you

3474
02:28:53,760 --> 02:28:58,398
know I would you know be be that as it

3475
02:28:55,760 --> 02:29:01,239
may you know we only see one to two%

3476
02:28:58,398 --> 02:29:04,039
fail rate across all compliance testing

3477
02:29:01,239 --> 02:29:07,199
you know so even as strict as these

3478
02:29:04,040 --> 02:29:08,720
standards are pretty [ __ ] good right

3479
02:29:07,200 --> 02:29:10,479
well and now cannabis is being proudly

3480
02:29:08,719 --> 02:29:12,840
touted as cleaner than food or cleaner

3481
02:29:10,478 --> 02:29:14,920
than water most it is you know right

3482
02:29:12,840 --> 02:29:16,318
yeah and and so and so at a different

3483
02:29:14,920 --> 02:29:20,159
we're held at a different level of

3484
02:29:16,318 --> 02:29:22,559
scrutiny and we how we able to do it we

3485
02:29:20,159 --> 02:29:24,719
have to be have you guys ever done any

3486
02:29:22,559 --> 02:29:27,079
non-cannabis testing other than these

3487
02:29:24,719 --> 02:29:30,119
papers like I was thinking more in terms

3488
02:29:27,079 --> 02:29:33,439
of like you know uh you know everyone

3489
02:29:30,120 --> 02:29:35,600
was concerned with the vape pen

3490
02:29:33,439 --> 02:29:38,120
manufacturing happening over in China

3491
02:29:35,600 --> 02:29:40,239
and that there could be lead and solder

3492
02:29:38,120 --> 02:29:43,520
and components of you guys so I take it

3493
02:29:40,239 --> 02:29:46,159
you're doing this metal testing by um by

3494
02:29:43,520 --> 02:29:48,120
ICP which again is a really

3495
02:29:46,159 --> 02:29:51,398
sophisticated test right I mean you have

3496
02:29:48,120 --> 02:29:53,960
to have the instrument and experts like

3497
02:29:51,398 --> 02:29:57,478
Josh to run it so it's not something

3498
02:29:53,959 --> 02:30:00,079
trivial like you could run other kinds

3499
02:29:57,478 --> 02:30:01,559
of tests so yeah and and if I may I'd

3500
02:30:00,079 --> 02:30:03,239
love Josh to kind of you know kind of

3501
02:30:01,559 --> 02:30:05,239
jump in because we're we even we got

3502
02:30:03,239 --> 02:30:06,478
smoke he fell off no he's right there

3503
02:30:05,239 --> 02:30:08,959
he's just on

3504
02:30:06,478 --> 02:30:10,639
mute but no but I just I just wanted to

3505
02:30:08,959 --> 02:30:12,079
make a point about supply chain yeah

3506
02:30:10,639 --> 02:30:13,439
because because what we find we find

3507
02:30:12,079 --> 02:30:15,879
ourselves in this position where we're

3508
02:30:13,439 --> 02:30:17,559
helping all those that we serve be you

3509
02:30:15,879 --> 02:30:20,079
know qualify their inputs Beyond

3510
02:30:17,559 --> 02:30:22,398
cannabis you know because cannabis is a

3511
02:30:20,079 --> 02:30:24,398
massive phyto remediator bioaccumulator

3512
02:30:22,398 --> 02:30:26,159
on its own you know but but we're also

3513
02:30:24,398 --> 02:30:27,478
helping them vet all these other supply

3514
02:30:26,159 --> 02:30:28,760
chain sources that they're going to be

3515
02:30:27,478 --> 02:30:30,599
adding something to cannabis whether

3516
02:30:28,760 --> 02:30:32,478
it's a rolling paper whether it's raw

3517
02:30:30,600 --> 02:30:33,920
cacao to make chocolates you know we

3518
02:30:32,478 --> 02:30:36,639
come to come to find out raw you know

3519
02:30:33,920 --> 02:30:37,840
Cacao is a phyto remediator of cadmium

3520
02:30:36,639 --> 02:30:40,000
and if it's grown around mountainous

3521
02:30:37,840 --> 02:30:41,840
regions in the world like the Andes then

3522
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:43,680
then the percentage of cacao that you do

3523
02:30:41,840 --> 02:30:45,478
a dark chocolate the higher the chance

3524
02:30:43,680 --> 02:30:48,680
you're going to fail for you know a

3525
02:30:45,478 --> 02:30:50,519
cannabis test because of the c s of caca

3526
02:30:48,680 --> 02:30:52,398
you know and same thing with qualifying

3527
02:30:50,520 --> 02:30:54,279
essential oils you know so it's almost

3528
02:30:52,398 --> 02:30:56,318
like there's don't forget the wrapper

3529
02:30:54,279 --> 02:30:58,680
that you're wrapping that cannabis

3530
02:30:56,318 --> 02:31:01,199
product in you know every all the

3531
02:30:58,680 --> 02:31:03,439
packaging yeah everything that cannabis

3532
02:31:01,200 --> 02:31:06,960
is everything that the product touches

3533
02:31:03,439 --> 02:31:09,760
right has an analytical qu quality

3534
02:31:06,959 --> 02:31:11,799
component that you guys and probably

3535
02:31:09,760 --> 02:31:13,680
other labs too are just trying to get

3536
02:31:11,799 --> 02:31:15,278
their hands around yeah and and you know

3537
02:31:13,680 --> 02:31:17,159
like putting live resin super high

3538
02:31:15,279 --> 02:31:19,239
turpine Rich extracts into a jar and

3539
02:31:17,159 --> 02:31:20,959
having a styrofoam insert kind of at the

3540
02:31:19,239 --> 02:31:23,079
top that seals it down and you see the

3541
02:31:20,959 --> 02:31:25,438
turpine ring around it probably not a

3542
02:31:23,079 --> 02:31:27,279
good idea oxide from the polyethylene

3543
02:31:25,439 --> 02:31:29,079
plastic you know so so yeah so there's

3544
02:31:27,279 --> 02:31:30,680
all these sources you know but I I'll

3545
02:31:29,079 --> 02:31:32,039
let Josh jump in on the heavy metal side

3546
02:31:30,680 --> 02:31:33,398
but but you know it's it's really

3547
02:31:32,040 --> 02:31:35,080
fascinating because it's we're just

3548
02:31:33,398 --> 02:31:37,079
seeing these consume you know consumer

3549
02:31:35,079 --> 02:31:38,600
trends of within kind of the testing

3550
02:31:37,079 --> 02:31:40,359
Market you know of all these inputs that

3551
02:31:38,600 --> 02:31:42,040
are other than cannabis but I really see

3552
02:31:40,359 --> 02:31:44,318
this like glimmer of hope that you know

3553
02:31:42,040 --> 02:31:47,080
the the scrutiny that we're held to now

3554
02:31:44,318 --> 02:31:48,760
is why can't food or every other

3555
02:31:47,079 --> 02:31:51,039
industry qualify to these standards

3556
02:31:48,760 --> 02:31:53,000
especially when when Stoners are put to

3557
02:31:51,040 --> 02:31:55,640
it we are able to kind of make it with

3558
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:57,799
you know one to two% fail rate you know

3559
02:31:55,639 --> 02:32:00,639
even as strict as the standards

3560
02:31:57,799 --> 02:32:03,358
are hey don't under underestimate what a

3561
02:32:00,639 --> 02:32:06,760
stoner could do with an

3562
02:32:03,359 --> 02:32:08,600
hlc and amen to that I always say that

3563
02:32:06,760 --> 02:32:10,478
food and you know like when people are

3564
02:32:08,600 --> 02:32:11,960
like oh cannabis shouldn't be regulated

3565
02:32:10,478 --> 02:32:13,920
like this I mean look at our food and

3566
02:32:11,959 --> 02:32:16,159
I'm like yeah it's killing you like at

3567
02:32:13,920 --> 02:32:18,398
an accelerated rate like the food is

3568
02:32:16,159 --> 02:32:21,039
killing people right now the water the

3569
02:32:18,398 --> 02:32:24,000
air quality and I would just add before

3570
02:32:21,040 --> 02:32:26,680
Josh uh says uh what he's going to say

3571
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:29,159
is that these kaix containers are the

3572
02:32:26,680 --> 02:32:32,559
first container that I actually

3573
02:32:29,159 --> 02:32:34,039
saw taking into account the Tarpin

3574
02:32:32,559 --> 02:32:36,398
consuming the

3575
02:32:34,040 --> 02:32:38,240
plastic so this is like a you know I

3576
02:32:36,398 --> 02:32:40,039
don't know if it's PTFE or what it is

3577
02:32:38,239 --> 02:32:42,799
but they he had told me originally this

3578
02:32:40,040 --> 02:32:44,920
is basically non-consumed by tpin it's

3579
02:32:42,799 --> 02:32:47,159
just a thin little layer and it fits

3580
02:32:44,920 --> 02:32:52,120
right inside the cap you can't even see

3581
02:32:47,159 --> 02:32:53,639
it wow boom kayb containers pretty cool

3582
02:32:52,120 --> 02:32:55,720
pretty cool little containers holding

3583
02:32:53,639 --> 02:32:56,879
holding all Industries to a new standard

3584
02:32:55,719 --> 02:32:58,519
that are going to come work with

3585
02:32:56,879 --> 02:33:01,599
cannabis and you know I've never seen

3586
02:32:58,520 --> 02:33:04,279
anything that market that's brilliant

3587
02:33:01,600 --> 02:33:06,680
yeah Jos and I don't have too much to to

3588
02:33:04,279 --> 02:33:09,479
to add other than you mention the The

3589
02:33:06,680 --> 02:33:11,239
Vape cartridges um you know it just you

3590
02:33:09,478 --> 02:33:12,920
know it's it's been you know it's been a

3591
02:33:11,239 --> 02:33:14,719
bit of a whack-a-mole as we as we you

3592
02:33:12,920 --> 02:33:17,000
know at least with us in California as

3593
02:33:14,719 --> 02:33:18,599
we've gone through the regulations um

3594
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:19,840
you know just identifying you know a lot

3595
02:33:18,600 --> 02:33:22,359
of things that you know people just

3596
02:33:19,840 --> 02:33:23,279
didn't think think about before before

3597
02:33:22,359 --> 02:33:24,880
anyone was kind of looking for the

3598
02:33:23,279 --> 02:33:27,359
contaminants so when we started doing

3599
02:33:24,879 --> 02:33:28,679
heavy metal testing that was one of the

3600
02:33:27,359 --> 02:33:30,079
um you know that was one of the sources

3601
02:33:28,680 --> 02:33:31,840
of contamination that popped up right

3602
02:33:30,079 --> 02:33:33,159
away all of a sudden you know we we

3603
02:33:31,840 --> 02:33:35,478
switched over to Metals testing and

3604
02:33:33,159 --> 02:33:37,799
there weren't a lot of labs or a lot of

3605
02:33:35,478 --> 02:33:39,478
customers that were that interested in

3606
02:33:37,799 --> 02:33:41,358
in doing Metals testing before it was

3607
02:33:39,478 --> 02:33:43,159
required so it came as a bit of a

3608
02:33:41,359 --> 02:33:44,880
surprise to everyone and as soon as you

3609
02:33:43,159 --> 02:33:46,439
know kind of the regulations flipped and

3610
02:33:44,879 --> 02:33:48,559
and and and if if you're not from

3611
02:33:46,439 --> 02:33:50,398
California we we sort of um implemented

3612
02:33:48,559 --> 02:33:52,600
our regulations in sort of a tiered

3613
02:33:50,398 --> 02:33:55,000
fashion and so the metals testing was

3614
02:33:52,600 --> 02:33:57,439
sort of the last tier um of of of

3615
02:33:55,000 --> 02:33:58,920
testing that was required and you know

3616
02:33:57,439 --> 02:34:00,680
immediately all of a sudden everyone

3617
02:33:58,920 --> 02:34:02,000
realized that you know the majority of

3618
02:34:00,680 --> 02:34:04,200
Vape cartridges on the market were

3619
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:06,318
failing for lead because like you said

3620
02:34:04,200 --> 02:34:07,960
there the the manufacturers of the

3621
02:34:06,318 --> 02:34:10,760
actual cartridges were were were using

3622
02:34:07,959 --> 02:34:13,000
lead in in in the um in the Wicks I

3623
02:34:10,760 --> 02:34:14,960
believe and uh um but it was it was one

3624
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:16,760
of those things that is solder too right

3625
02:34:14,959 --> 02:34:18,278
yeah yep and solder and that's and

3626
02:34:16,760 --> 02:34:20,559
that's a big source of contamination in

3627
02:34:18,279 --> 02:34:21,520
a lot of uh you know a lot manufacturing

3628
02:34:20,559 --> 02:34:22,639
things we're talking about papers

3629
02:34:21,520 --> 02:34:26,000
earlier that those are the type of

3630
02:34:22,639 --> 02:34:28,799
places where enters but but solder is

3631
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:31,279
defined by a certain percentage of lead

3632
02:34:28,799 --> 02:34:34,159
right I I'm not an electrical person but

3633
02:34:31,279 --> 02:34:36,840
I think that a solder is just an alloy

3634
02:34:34,159 --> 02:34:38,520
of lead tin and a bunch of other stuff

3635
02:34:36,840 --> 02:34:41,398
so as soon as you hear solder you're

3636
02:34:38,520 --> 02:34:43,159
like oh yeah test that [ __ ] for lead

3637
02:34:41,398 --> 02:34:45,318
right and if you're making any type of

3638
02:34:43,159 --> 02:34:47,119
food grade food grade equipment you need

3639
02:34:45,318 --> 02:34:48,199
to use special lead free solder and

3640
02:34:47,120 --> 02:34:50,160
that's one of those one of those things

3641
02:34:48,200 --> 02:34:51,399
that often gets overlooked and so but

3642
02:34:50,159 --> 02:34:53,398
but then as soon as you know as soon as

3643
02:34:51,398 --> 02:34:55,398
we were doing the testing it took you

3644
02:34:53,398 --> 02:34:56,959
know it took a matter of weeks to to

3645
02:34:55,398 --> 02:34:59,358
kind of spool up these factories to

3646
02:34:56,959 --> 02:35:01,919
produce new cartridges using I guess a

3647
02:34:59,359 --> 02:35:03,800
different solder um formula and I mean

3648
02:35:01,920 --> 02:35:05,439
it happened over Chinese New Years and

3649
02:35:03,799 --> 02:35:06,799
most of these are produced in China so

3650
02:35:05,439 --> 02:35:08,159
there was a little bit of a a delay

3651
02:35:06,799 --> 02:35:10,079
because of the holiday I remember that

3652
02:35:08,159 --> 02:35:11,719
was that was stressful times but um you

3653
02:35:10,079 --> 02:35:13,039
know within a matter of weeks people

3654
02:35:11,719 --> 02:35:15,119
were able to get cartridges that could

3655
02:35:13,040 --> 02:35:16,359
pass back out on the market and um and

3656
02:35:15,120 --> 02:35:17,840
it just kind of goes to show that with a

3657
02:35:16,359 --> 02:35:20,200
lot of these testing regulations we do a

3658
02:35:17,840 --> 02:35:21,359
lot of testing of of organic produce you

3659
02:35:20,200 --> 02:35:23,640
know you're talking about kind of what's

3660
02:35:21,359 --> 02:35:24,760
in the food you know in in I guess with

3661
02:35:23,639 --> 02:35:27,559
food you have the choice of going

3662
02:35:24,760 --> 02:35:29,159
organic but even still um we we test a

3663
02:35:27,559 --> 02:35:31,840
lot of organic produce because we use

3664
02:35:29,159 --> 02:35:34,039
you know like lettuce or or spinach as

3665
02:35:31,840 --> 02:35:35,719
as as sort of blanks for some of our

3666
02:35:34,040 --> 02:35:37,040
tests and things like that and and we

3667
02:35:35,719 --> 02:35:39,159
have to purchase and we trying to get it

3668
02:35:37,040 --> 02:35:41,640
pesticide free um and that's really hard

3669
02:35:39,159 --> 02:35:43,520
to do even with Organics um because you

3670
02:35:41,639 --> 02:35:46,559
know just Drift from other farms and

3671
02:35:43,520 --> 02:35:48,479
what not um and just really hard to to

3672
02:35:46,559 --> 02:35:50,439
identify sources of contamination unless

3673
02:35:48,478 --> 02:35:52,719
you're actually doing batch testing and

3674
02:35:50,439 --> 02:35:55,079
it just it just falls on on on the labs

3675
02:35:52,719 --> 02:35:56,799
like us to um you know to help you know

3676
02:35:55,079 --> 02:35:58,318
help guide that conversation and push

3677
02:35:56,799 --> 02:36:00,719
for common sense regulation where where

3678
02:35:58,318 --> 02:36:02,119
testing doesn't become a burden um and

3679
02:36:00,719 --> 02:36:04,879
people see it as sort of you know I

3680
02:36:02,120 --> 02:36:07,240
guess one of the value ads of of of

3681
02:36:04,879 --> 02:36:09,039
purchasing um cannabis on the on the on

3682
02:36:07,239 --> 02:36:10,680
the regulated market is is is that you

3683
02:36:09,040 --> 02:36:12,000
know that there's a quality control that

3684
02:36:10,680 --> 02:36:13,680
goes into it you know there's testing

3685
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:15,159
that goes into it and and you know as

3686
02:36:13,680 --> 02:36:19,079
long as we can keep doing that and not

3687
02:36:15,159 --> 02:36:20,799
be too burdensome um Josh Josh here's a

3688
02:36:19,079 --> 02:36:22,439
question I just love to ask and you're

3689
02:36:20,799 --> 02:36:25,000
probably one of the only people in the

3690
02:36:22,439 --> 02:36:26,960
world who could answer this with having

3691
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:29,439
the knowledge and and experience that

3692
02:36:26,959 --> 02:36:32,239
you've had which is that if there are

3693
02:36:29,439 --> 02:36:35,000
lead components in the solder and if the

3694
02:36:32,239 --> 02:36:38,520
cannabis oil inside a vape cartridge

3695
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:40,200
comes in contact is is there I mean I

3696
02:36:38,520 --> 02:36:44,439
understand chemistry at the molecular

3697
02:36:40,200 --> 02:36:47,399
basis but I I I don't really know is

3698
02:36:44,439 --> 02:36:49,880
there a sizable leeching of the lead

3699
02:36:47,398 --> 02:36:52,199
into the cannabis oil so now what you're

3700
02:36:49,879 --> 02:36:55,079
vaporizing what you're so yeah there's

3701
02:36:52,200 --> 02:36:56,960
lead inside the the cartridge let's just

3702
02:36:55,079 --> 02:36:59,279
you know get over that fact but what

3703
02:36:56,959 --> 02:37:01,879
you're actually vaporizing does that

3704
02:36:59,279 --> 02:37:04,760
actually contain lead and do you have

3705
02:37:01,879 --> 02:37:08,119
data to say like how long the lifetime

3706
02:37:04,760 --> 02:37:10,478
of an oil in a a cartridge that contains

3707
02:37:08,120 --> 02:37:12,200
lead should be so like maybe they could

3708
02:37:10,478 --> 02:37:14,719
just put an expiration date so the

3709
02:37:12,200 --> 02:37:17,479
longer say like a cartridge sits around

3710
02:37:14,719 --> 02:37:20,199
the more lead leashes into the oil till

3711
02:37:17,478 --> 02:37:21,679
it reaches a certain level yeah it

3712
02:37:20,200 --> 02:37:22,880
definitely it definitely leeches into

3713
02:37:21,680 --> 02:37:24,880
the oil because that's you know that's

3714
02:37:22,879 --> 02:37:27,478
what we're testing for for our you know

3715
02:37:24,879 --> 02:37:28,839
our testing and and so when when when

3716
02:37:27,478 --> 02:37:30,840
they were putting lead into these

3717
02:37:28,840 --> 02:37:32,600
cartridges you know we were that's what

3718
02:37:30,840 --> 02:37:35,120
where we were seeing it is in the actual

3719
02:37:32,600 --> 02:37:36,720
oil um and and certainly the longer they

3720
02:37:35,120 --> 02:37:39,120
sit the more chance there is for that

3721
02:37:36,719 --> 02:37:41,119
lead to leech but um lead lead isn't

3722
02:37:39,120 --> 02:37:43,160
super isn't going to be soluble in in

3723
02:37:41,120 --> 02:37:45,520
the oil very well what we saw more is

3724
02:37:43,159 --> 02:37:47,879
the source contamination is is sort of

3725
02:37:45,520 --> 02:37:49,800
how the um cartridges were produced

3726
02:37:47,879 --> 02:37:51,879
because that was still early early days

3727
02:37:49,799 --> 02:37:53,679
of producing cartridges um I think at

3728
02:37:51,879 --> 02:37:56,719
the time most people were still putting

3729
02:37:53,680 --> 02:37:58,279
them together by hand um and so you know

3730
02:37:56,719 --> 02:38:01,000
we would open up a cartridge and you

3731
02:37:58,279 --> 02:38:02,439
would see in the oil you would see like

3732
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:04,639
it look like glitter like little metal

3733
02:38:02,439 --> 02:38:06,040
flx just from you know that whoever put

3734
02:38:04,639 --> 02:38:07,959
that cartridge together put used a

3735
02:38:06,040 --> 02:38:10,319
little too much force or you know just

3736
02:38:07,959 --> 02:38:11,959
bad workmanship and and sort of metal

3737
02:38:10,318 --> 02:38:14,000
metal was kind of flaking off into the

3738
02:38:11,959 --> 02:38:15,919
material so I I think in general too it

3739
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:17,680
was just kind of early on in the process

3740
02:38:15,920 --> 02:38:19,960
and bad quality control and that that

3741
02:38:17,680 --> 02:38:21,920
played a l large part in it too as is it

3742
02:38:19,959 --> 02:38:24,358
just seemed it seemed how the the

3743
02:38:21,920 --> 02:38:24,359
cartridges

3744
02:38:39,309 --> 02:38:42,409
[Music]

3745
02:38:42,478 --> 02:38:47,679
were form metal Sal coating on the

3746
02:38:45,879 --> 02:38:49,799
surface of say your solder because a lot

3747
02:38:47,680 --> 02:38:52,398
of times a lot of these Metals will form

3748
02:38:49,799 --> 02:38:54,599
oxides because when they react with air

3749
02:38:52,398 --> 02:38:56,439
like uh Statue liberty is perfect

3750
02:38:54,600 --> 02:38:58,279
example right that green color and the

3751
02:38:56,439 --> 02:39:00,720
Statue liberty that's copper oxide

3752
02:38:58,279 --> 02:39:02,600
because the oxide is basically corroded

3753
02:39:00,719 --> 02:39:05,398
over the years and basically the oxide

3754
02:39:02,600 --> 02:39:08,479
is what's covering so you could imagine

3755
02:39:05,398 --> 02:39:11,000
that yeah thca and other acidic

3756
02:39:08,478 --> 02:39:13,559
components and cannabis oil extracts

3757
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:14,639
that go inside pen cartridges could now

3758
02:39:13,559 --> 02:39:17,239
make a

3759
02:39:14,639 --> 02:39:19,760
soluble metal complex so now what's

3760
02:39:17,239 --> 02:39:21,879
being so what's being vaporized not

3761
02:39:19,760 --> 02:39:23,960
really so worried about all these metal

3762
02:39:21,879 --> 02:39:28,199
particulates in there I'd be more

3763
02:39:23,959 --> 02:39:30,478
worried about some sort of lead phca

3764
02:39:28,200 --> 02:39:32,319
salt that's vaporized that I'm taking

3765
02:39:30,478 --> 02:39:34,599
into my lungs

3766
02:39:32,318 --> 02:39:37,119
right and and we didn't speak we you

3767
02:39:34,600 --> 02:39:39,920
know we don't we don't speciate you know

3768
02:39:37,120 --> 02:39:42,200
the the the metals the metals and and

3769
02:39:39,920 --> 02:39:43,520
Mercury's a lot like that too Mercury is

3770
02:39:42,200 --> 02:39:45,120
and it's not one we we've seen in

3771
02:39:43,520 --> 02:39:47,800
cartridges but Mercury is you know very

3772
02:39:45,120 --> 02:39:51,000
Mercury's volatile um but Elemental

3773
02:39:47,799 --> 02:39:54,199
Mercury isn't isn't is toxic is is you

3774
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:56,760
know is is you know it's not the toxic

3775
02:39:54,200 --> 02:39:58,720
species of of of mercury when compared

3776
02:39:56,760 --> 02:40:02,800
to things like the the organic species

3777
02:39:58,719 --> 02:40:04,318
of mercury so um so that that that all

3778
02:40:02,799 --> 02:40:05,920
those Dynamics all play a large part in

3779
02:40:04,318 --> 02:40:08,600
it and we don't have good data on the

3780
02:40:05,920 --> 02:40:12,040
vapor and we we actually just recently

3781
02:40:08,600 --> 02:40:14,040
um we we we got a a vaporizing a vaping

3782
02:40:12,040 --> 02:40:16,520
robot essentially that um where we can

3783
02:40:14,040 --> 02:40:18,080
now um you know vaporize these pens you

3784
02:40:16,520 --> 02:40:19,640
stick the pens in it it can it can it

3785
02:40:18,079 --> 02:40:21,398
can has a little finger that can touch

3786
02:40:19,639 --> 02:40:24,199
the button and so you can you can play

3787
02:40:21,398 --> 02:40:25,959
that goes right into the GC well yeah we

3788
02:40:24,200 --> 02:40:27,880
we we capture the vapor and then we then

3789
02:40:25,959 --> 02:40:29,799
we inject it right into the GC or the

3790
02:40:27,879 --> 02:40:31,199
ICP and so we we first started kind of

3791
02:40:29,799 --> 02:40:34,119
with the Organics but we're working

3792
02:40:31,200 --> 02:40:35,600
right now with with um Metals analysis

3793
02:40:34,120 --> 02:40:37,160
of the vapor and so that's actually

3794
02:40:35,600 --> 02:40:39,479
something we've been we've been working

3795
02:40:37,159 --> 02:40:42,079
on so maybe yeah I'd love to see you

3796
02:40:39,478 --> 02:40:46,000
guys back back up those findings from

3797
02:40:42,079 --> 02:40:48,920
what Robert strong in on degradation to

3798
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:50,200
what uh croline and Benzene and all

3799
02:40:48,920 --> 02:40:52,478
thing I think there's a lot of hand

3800
02:40:50,200 --> 02:40:54,359
waving you know about some of the

3801
02:40:52,478 --> 02:40:56,278
degradation chemistry that happens on

3802
02:40:54,359 --> 02:40:58,800
dabbing you know I mean those guys got a

3803
02:40:56,279 --> 02:41:01,120
lot of PR out about that and there's

3804
02:40:58,799 --> 02:41:03,358
some studies and I wanted to try to go

3805
02:41:01,120 --> 02:41:05,319
reproduce that in my lab but you need

3806
02:41:03,359 --> 02:41:10,159
one of those cigarette smoking machines

3807
02:41:05,318 --> 02:41:12,079
which I just don't have so you know yeah

3808
02:41:10,159 --> 02:41:14,279
as soon as I mean we're doing it to to

3809
02:41:12,079 --> 02:41:15,799
to share the results so you know we

3810
02:41:14,279 --> 02:41:17,600
we'll let you know what we find out but

3811
02:41:15,799 --> 02:41:20,599
that's that's that's actually our next

3812
02:41:17,600 --> 02:41:22,920
project right now so

3813
02:41:20,600 --> 02:41:24,600
yeah yeah I think that the funny I want

3814
02:41:22,920 --> 02:41:27,478
say the funny thing but the ironic thing

3815
02:41:24,600 --> 02:41:29,318
is that again people I think I mean

3816
02:41:27,478 --> 02:41:31,199
people love vape pens they just love the

3817
02:41:29,318 --> 02:41:33,239
convenience of it and everything and

3818
02:41:31,200 --> 02:41:35,319
when covid kind of came around it was

3819
02:41:33,239 --> 02:41:37,920
also one of those things where the whole

3820
02:41:35,318 --> 02:41:39,799
communal aspect of cannabis use you know

3821
02:41:37,920 --> 02:41:41,239
of passing a joint was just not

3822
02:41:39,799 --> 02:41:43,719
happening anymore everyone was doing

3823
02:41:41,239 --> 02:41:46,639
their own personal vaporized of their

3824
02:41:43,719 --> 02:41:48,559
own personal thing and so again I get

3825
02:41:46,639 --> 02:41:49,799
asked questions about this all the time

3826
02:41:48,559 --> 02:41:52,600
you know what about

3827
02:41:49,799 --> 02:41:54,398
all these pen parts from China you know

3828
02:41:52,600 --> 02:41:57,960
are they made in factories full of

3829
02:41:54,398 --> 02:42:00,559
people with covid you know and uh you

3830
02:41:57,959 --> 02:42:01,679
know another uh question I'm asked all

3831
02:42:00,559 --> 02:42:04,119
the time that I don't know if you guys

3832
02:42:01,680 --> 02:42:08,600
have any experience with but can plant

3833
02:42:04,120 --> 02:42:10,920
material be a a a vector for for virus

3834
02:42:08,600 --> 02:42:13,279
virus transfer you know like if people

3835
02:42:10,920 --> 02:42:15,760
are sick in a grow you know can they

3836
02:42:13,279 --> 02:42:18,920
contaminate plant material so that that

3837
02:42:15,760 --> 02:42:23,880
plant material is dangerous in a CO as

3838
02:42:18,920 --> 02:42:27,960
far as I know that doesn't happen

3839
02:42:23,879 --> 02:42:30,119
Okay and the virus on surfaces I don't

3840
02:42:27,959 --> 02:42:33,159
think there's any proof that it lasted

3841
02:42:30,120 --> 02:42:33,160
longer than a few

3842
02:42:33,559 --> 02:42:37,239
days yeah I mean I think that it's

3843
02:42:35,680 --> 02:42:40,639
pretty well known I think the way that

3844
02:42:37,239 --> 02:42:42,559
people get this is by breathing the air

3845
02:42:40,639 --> 02:42:44,639
that other people are breathing who

3846
02:42:42,559 --> 02:42:47,559
contaminated or or touching it with

3847
02:42:44,639 --> 02:42:49,680
their hands and then rubbing their

3848
02:42:47,559 --> 02:42:51,840
faces one thing I can tell you those

3849
02:42:49,680 --> 02:42:53,880
outdoor cannabis would would have much

3850
02:42:51,840 --> 02:42:56,359
less chance of transmitting Co without

3851
02:42:53,879 --> 02:42:58,079
the UV exposure so it's another plug for

3852
02:42:56,359 --> 02:43:01,159
outdoor

3853
02:42:58,079 --> 02:43:03,478
cannabis and and so so this would be a

3854
02:43:01,159 --> 02:43:07,200
great great group to ask this like I I I

3855
02:43:03,478 --> 02:43:10,159
hope I I saw some paper or somebody post

3856
02:43:07,200 --> 02:43:12,279
something um I didn't look into but I

3857
02:43:10,159 --> 02:43:14,279
thought it was even just a like you know

3858
02:43:12,279 --> 02:43:16,479
some fake news or something but smoking

3859
02:43:14,279 --> 02:43:19,439
cannabis had some effect in minimizing

3860
02:43:16,478 --> 02:43:21,079
covid exposure is that totally BS oh

3861
02:43:19,439 --> 02:43:23,200
there's a couple studies there's people

3862
02:43:21,079 --> 02:43:24,719
who are really thinking their teeth in

3863
02:43:23,200 --> 02:43:28,000
there's a group up in British Columbia

3864
02:43:24,719 --> 02:43:31,840
by Marcus that uh published that it uh

3865
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:34,959
CBD does seem to inhibit the enzyme that

3866
02:43:31,840 --> 02:43:36,600
required for covid to take hold in the

3867
02:43:34,959 --> 02:43:38,398
body that's just sort of like a Layman's

3868
02:43:36,600 --> 02:43:41,040
way of describing it but there's a

3869
02:43:38,398 --> 02:43:44,439
couple groups that yeah are now showing

3870
02:43:41,040 --> 02:43:46,760
it's interesting on last has church when

3871
02:43:44,439 --> 02:43:49,960
we had it last time and the very same

3872
02:43:46,760 --> 02:43:53,359
question was asked there was a a YouTube

3873
02:43:49,959 --> 02:43:56,119
published by an Israeli guy who had no

3874
02:43:53,359 --> 02:44:00,159
um data whatsoever to say that it's

3875
02:43:56,120 --> 02:44:02,000
effective to treat or prevent covid uh

3876
02:44:00,159 --> 02:44:04,559
but since then there's been a lot of

3877
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:07,799
people a lot of people looking at

3878
02:44:04,559 --> 02:44:11,559
it the alternative cannaboids as well

3879
02:44:07,799 --> 02:44:11,559
CBG and CBD too as

3880
02:44:12,520 --> 02:44:17,640

3899
02:45:01,600 --> 02:45:06,960
through unfortunately I'm starting to

3900
02:45:04,079 --> 02:45:10,079
learn of more more people that I know

3901
02:45:06,959 --> 02:45:12,398
that didn't weren't so

3902
02:45:10,079 --> 02:45:15,520
lucky well we'll wish them the best and

3903
02:45:12,398 --> 02:45:17,639
anyone else I I haven't your mask I

3904
02:45:15,520 --> 02:45:19,800
haven't really met a ton of people or

3905
02:45:17,639 --> 02:45:21,760
know a ton of people that are cannabis

3906
02:45:19,799 --> 02:45:25,639
you know daily

3907
02:45:21,760 --> 02:45:27,520
inhalers that have gotten it I've I've

3908
02:45:25,639 --> 02:45:29,760
I've only heard of maybe a few and the

3909
02:45:27,520 --> 02:45:32,800
ones that did didn't seem to have very

3910
02:45:29,760 --> 02:45:32,800
bad uh

3911
02:45:34,159 --> 02:45:39,398
symptoms maybe there's something to that

3912
02:45:37,600 --> 02:45:41,279
I don't know I just someone asked me I

3913
02:45:39,398 --> 02:45:43,239
think it was Mark Mark McCoy actually

3914
02:45:41,279 --> 02:45:45,239
from VP tech asked me and I had to think

3915
02:45:43,239 --> 02:45:46,398
about it and was like no come to think

3916
02:45:45,239 --> 02:45:49,199
about it

3917
02:45:46,398 --> 02:45:51,318
no guess I'll ask that question to all

3918
02:45:49,200 --> 02:45:55,120
you do you guys know any daily inhalers

3919
02:45:51,318 --> 02:45:59,239
that have been negatively affected by

3920
02:45:55,120 --> 02:46:01,200
covid-19 no other than

3921
02:45:59,239 --> 02:46:05,000
Rob

3922
02:46:01,200 --> 02:46:07,279
no Mark McCoy pick up Mark mcco the

3923
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:10,200
people I I know a guy who passed but he

3924
02:46:07,279 --> 02:46:11,640
was already he already had COPD so he

3925
02:46:10,200 --> 02:46:17,079
already had lung

3926
02:46:11,639 --> 02:46:17,079
issues um I guess was more suscep to

3927
02:46:17,920 --> 02:46:23,200
it time for a

3928
02:46:20,079 --> 02:46:26,200
dab almost done got about 14 minutes

3929

3931
02:46:29,478 --> 02:46:37,199
the flu once or twice for a day or two

3932
02:46:32,760 --> 02:46:40,398
at the most and I I my wife always said

3933
02:46:37,200 --> 02:46:43,040
it was because I smoke so

3934
02:46:40,398 --> 02:46:44,358
much for sure it is there's no doubt

3935
02:46:43,040 --> 02:46:46,399
about it I can't believe you didn't get

3936
02:46:44,359 --> 02:46:48,040
the plague when we were all in Barcelona

3937
02:46:46,398 --> 02:46:50,318
together every single person in that

3938
02:46:48,040 --> 02:46:53,640
apartment but you got the

3939

3947
02:47:16,398 --> 02:47:24,478
horrible that that to many people too

3948
02:47:20,279 --> 02:47:27,120

4001
02:49:49,920 --> 02:49:54,439
I'm sorry said homegrown people going to

4002
02:49:53,200 --> 02:49:56,040
grow more people going to grow a lot

4003
02:49:54,439 --> 02:49:57,600
more cannabis now I believe there's

4004
02:49:56,040 --> 02:49:59,800
going to be a lot more growing at home

4005
02:49:57,600 --> 02:50:01,680
and around the world it's GNA be a

4006
02:49:59,799 --> 02:50:03,039
beautiful thing yeah and I and I feel

4007
02:50:01,680 --> 02:50:04,200
like the apocalypse is a beautiful thing

4008
02:50:03,040 --> 02:50:05,200
it's not you know everybody's freaking

4009
02:50:04,200 --> 02:50:06,000
out that the you know everybody's

4010
02:50:05,200 --> 02:50:07,960
freaking out like we're in the

4011
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:10,639
apocalypse like it's all hell you know

4012
02:50:07,959 --> 02:50:12,119
kind of you know doom day fire and

4013
02:50:10,639 --> 02:50:13,920
although we're in a deep state of

4014
02:50:12,120 --> 02:50:15,840
suffering in this earth and just

4015
02:50:13,920 --> 02:50:18,279
everything that's happening and the

4016
02:50:15,840 --> 02:50:19,279
amount of immense human suffering is is

4017
02:50:18,279 --> 02:50:21,359
over

4018
02:50:19,279 --> 02:50:23,560
I just I can't help but feel you know

4019
02:50:21,359 --> 02:50:25,399
the root the root of the word apocalypse

4020
02:50:23,559 --> 02:50:28,199
means the time of Revelation or the

4021
02:50:25,398 --> 02:50:29,879
great unveiling and [ __ ] it seems like

4022
02:50:28,200 --> 02:50:31,640
we're in that time you know just the

4023
02:50:29,879 --> 02:50:34,119
faith and institutions faith and all

4024
02:50:31,639 --> 02:50:35,599
trust you know all gurus everything

4025
02:50:34,120 --> 02:50:38,319
everybody's a per everybody you know all

4026
02:50:35,600 --> 02:50:40,520
this stuff you know is happening and and

4027
02:50:38,318 --> 02:50:42,879
and and and as a result you know I feel

4028
02:50:40,520 --> 02:50:44,200
like you know in this time of Revelation

4029
02:50:42,879 --> 02:50:46,438
I feel like cannabis and Hamp are almost

4030
02:50:44,200 --> 02:50:48,239
the leading Horsemen of this apocalypse

4031
02:50:46,439 --> 02:50:50,040
you know and and you know the the more

4032
02:50:48,238 --> 02:50:51,959
we can Embrace and engage the plant the

4033
02:50:50,040 --> 02:50:54,160
more we can help it can help give us the

4034
02:50:51,959 --> 02:50:55,959
tools you know to alleviate suffering

4035
02:50:54,159 --> 02:50:58,318
and to lead in this time this new time

4036
02:50:55,959 --> 02:51:00,000
of Revelation and and this shifting of

4037
02:50:58,318 --> 02:51:01,879
times and and then you know leading the

4038
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:03,920
and then you know leading the charge for

4039
02:51:01,879 --> 02:51:06,238
all the other plant superheroes that are

4040
02:51:03,920 --> 02:51:08,318
you know the other horsemen yeah well

4041
02:51:06,238 --> 02:51:11,039
said Alec for sure I I'm in full

4042
02:51:08,318 --> 02:51:13,079
agreeance I love the shift that's been

4043
02:51:11,040 --> 02:51:16,120
happening slowly but surely with

4044
02:51:13,079 --> 02:51:18,039
mainstream and alcohol consumption and

4045
02:51:16,120 --> 02:51:20,479
you know people are understanding now

4046
02:51:18,040 --> 02:51:23,680
that alcohol consumption during these

4047
02:51:20,478 --> 02:51:25,278
times as well as really any times it's

4048
02:51:23,680 --> 02:51:27,200
just not noticeable people become

4049
02:51:25,279 --> 02:51:29,200
hypnotized by it particularly people who

4050
02:51:27,200 --> 02:51:30,760
are abusing it on a high level they

4051
02:51:29,200 --> 02:51:32,520
don't realize how foggy they're getting

4052
02:51:30,760 --> 02:51:35,200
they don't realize how many how they're

4053
02:51:32,520 --> 02:51:36,680
just vibing at a lower frequency how it

4054
02:51:35,200 --> 02:51:38,520
just brings them down and creates

4055
02:51:36,680 --> 02:51:41,559
depression and it's not the party that

4056
02:51:38,520 --> 02:51:44,520
it seems to be and you can see so many

4057
02:51:41,559 --> 02:51:46,719
people in you know in quarantine like

4058
02:51:44,520 --> 02:51:49,600
for five six months and drinking more

4059
02:51:46,719 --> 02:51:52,278
and getting into fights and beaten wives

4060
02:51:49,600 --> 02:51:54,920
and beaten kids and slowly but surely I

4061
02:51:52,279 --> 02:51:57,720
see this this shift where people are

4062
02:51:54,920 --> 02:51:59,760
like acknowledging this this drug and

4063
02:51:57,719 --> 02:52:01,639
what it does and how it'll take

4064
02:51:59,760 --> 02:52:05,000
everything from you if you allow it and

4065
02:52:01,639 --> 02:52:06,799
that it's you know potentially based on

4066
02:52:05,000 --> 02:52:08,680
the amount of death deaths yeah based on

4067
02:52:06,799 --> 02:52:10,879
the amount of deaths annually that it

4068
02:52:08,680 --> 02:52:13,639
produces it's probably one of the most

4069
02:52:10,879 --> 02:52:16,039
dangerous drugs on the planet it's it's

4070
02:52:13,639 --> 02:52:17,920
incredible how mainstream it is so now

4071
02:52:16,040 --> 02:52:20,600
people shifting into maybe I'll try some

4072
02:52:17,920 --> 02:52:22,520
cannabis and not only like unraveling

4073
02:52:20,600 --> 02:52:24,760
the lie that is alcohol but now

4074
02:52:22,520 --> 02:52:27,079
unraveling the lie that is cannabis and

4075
02:52:24,760 --> 02:52:29,200
realizing in this shift wow like I've

4076
02:52:27,079 --> 02:52:31,159
had enough of that and I'm look for

4077
02:52:29,200 --> 02:52:33,479
looking forward to a little bit more of

4078
02:52:31,159 --> 02:52:38,079
this hey I hate to be the voice of

4079
02:52:33,478 --> 02:52:40,519
dissension but I just started drinking

4080
02:52:38,079 --> 02:52:44,318
and I actually think it's quite an

4081
02:52:40,520 --> 02:52:46,120
interesting drug um you know I'm I

4082
02:52:44,318 --> 02:52:49,398
practice makes perfect I'm not good at

4083
02:52:46,120 --> 02:52:51,000
it or anything but um yeah I really

4084
02:52:49,398 --> 02:52:52,519
haven't ever been a drinker the

4085
02:52:51,000 --> 02:52:56,318
difference between a drug and a medicine

4086
02:52:52,520 --> 02:52:59,238
is dose right or or poison medicine

4087
02:52:56,318 --> 02:53:01,879
intention yeah alcohol is not a medicine

4088
02:52:59,238 --> 02:53:01,879
alcohol is a

4089
02:53:02,279 --> 02:53:07,560
solent yeah you know what I mostly get

4090
02:53:05,079 --> 02:53:09,959
my um views on it from growing up in an

4091
02:53:07,559 --> 02:53:11,719
incubator of alcoholism in my city and

4092
02:53:09,959 --> 02:53:13,839
the way people abused it and that you

4093
02:53:11,719 --> 02:53:15,799
know my mother working at 911 and me

4094
02:53:13,840 --> 02:53:18,279
asking her hey what percentage of calls

4095
02:53:15,799 --> 02:53:21,278
are 911 related and her saying oh you

4096
02:53:18,279 --> 02:53:23,120
know probably between like 80 and 85 and

4097
02:53:21,279 --> 02:53:25,200
my sister chiming in going come on Mom

4098
02:53:23,120 --> 02:53:27,640
it's got to be 90 because she also works

4099
02:53:25,200 --> 02:53:29,840
there and I'm thinking like wow like 80

4100
02:53:27,639 --> 02:53:32,599
to 90% of the calls that go into the

4101
02:53:29,840 --> 02:53:36,000
police or alcohol related like that is a

4102
02:53:32,600 --> 02:53:38,559
huge like serious tear on the social

4103
02:53:36,000 --> 02:53:40,840
fabric like the cost of that alone and

4104
02:53:38,559 --> 02:53:42,719
then I start thinking it must be the

4105
02:53:40,840 --> 02:53:44,880
equivalent at the hospitals like there

4106
02:53:42,719 --> 02:53:47,079
must be such a huge percentage of people

4107
02:53:44,879 --> 02:53:49,159
that are ending up at the H hospitals

4108
02:53:47,079 --> 02:53:51,000
through whether you know car accidents

4109
02:53:49,159 --> 02:53:52,119
because people are drunk or fights or

4110
02:53:51,000 --> 02:53:54,439
this that and the other thing and it

4111
02:53:52,120 --> 02:53:57,600
just sort of started to blow my mind at

4112
02:53:54,439 --> 02:53:59,318
the cost of this this particular drug

4113
02:53:57,600 --> 02:54:01,399
that just seems to cause so much pain

4114
02:53:59,318 --> 02:54:03,639
and anguish and I think from an

4115
02:54:01,398 --> 02:54:05,358
extractor perspective I think of like

4116
02:54:03,639 --> 02:54:07,519
yeah like Mark said it's a solvent what

4117
02:54:05,359 --> 02:54:09,920
it does is it extracts the essence of

4118
02:54:07,520 --> 02:54:12,000
things and you can see people who have

4119
02:54:09,920 --> 02:54:14,920
abused it over the course of 30 or 40

4120
02:54:12,000 --> 02:54:16,279
years have had their Essence extracted

4121
02:54:14,920 --> 02:54:18,398
you know it just won't take that

4122
02:54:16,279 --> 02:54:21,040
medicine from the from the plant it's

4123
02:54:18,398 --> 02:54:23,519
seems to do it from people too at least

4124
02:54:21,040 --> 02:54:25,560
from my limited perspective I don't feel

4125
02:54:23,520 --> 02:54:27,000
that way about people who seem to have a

4126
02:54:25,559 --> 02:54:29,478
relationship with it where they can

4127
02:54:27,000 --> 02:54:32,000
actually just drink a glass of it and

4128
02:54:29,478 --> 02:54:33,959
have quite an enjoyment uh it's more the

4129
02:54:32,000 --> 02:54:36,920
people that seem to be out of control

4130
02:54:33,959 --> 02:54:39,238
from it that just uh they they tend to

4131
02:54:36,920 --> 02:54:40,799
fall into the hook where they hang out

4132
02:54:39,238 --> 02:54:43,238
with people who can enjoy alcohol

4133
02:54:40,799 --> 02:54:44,799
without having a problem and then there

4134
02:54:43,238 --> 02:54:47,879
you know it doesn't work out that way

4135
02:54:44,799 --> 02:54:51,238
for them but that's just my perspective

4136
02:54:47,879 --> 02:54:53,879
it used to medicine you know uh so did

4137
02:54:51,238 --> 02:54:56,799
tobacco I mean there was a relationship

4138
02:54:53,879 --> 02:54:59,199
to it that that I think the problems are

4139
02:54:56,799 --> 02:55:02,959
endemic so they're social as well

4140
02:54:59,200 --> 02:55:06,800
cultural they're and and deeply um

4141
02:55:02,959 --> 02:55:08,639
emotional so those are the the deeper

4142
02:55:06,799 --> 02:55:10,358
issues where we blame the drug and we

4143
02:55:08,639 --> 02:55:14,079
name we name and blame the drug because

4144
02:55:10,359 --> 02:55:17,040
I'm sort of like um feel like

4145
02:55:14,079 --> 02:55:18,840
that's what is some drugs are bad you

4146
02:55:17,040 --> 02:55:20,880
know um

4147
02:55:18,840 --> 02:55:23,520
and it seems like the the immunity

4148
02:55:20,879 --> 02:55:25,519
defense though it goes down so far with

4149
02:55:23,520 --> 02:55:28,399
alcohol use that besides the addictive

4150
02:55:25,520 --> 02:55:30,159
Tendencies and the social repercussion

4151
02:55:28,398 --> 02:55:32,238
that just personally just my opinion but

4152
02:55:30,159 --> 02:55:34,000
it seems like watching now this day more

4153
02:55:32,238 --> 02:55:36,119
than ever people got to keep their

4154
02:55:34,000 --> 02:55:37,719
immune defense high and alcohol I know

4155
02:55:36,120 --> 02:55:41,319
if I ever had more than one I haven't

4156
02:55:37,719 --> 02:55:43,920
drank for you know 15 16 months straight

4157
02:55:41,318 --> 02:55:45,680
just quit over a year ago but I know

4158
02:55:43,920 --> 02:55:47,200
back then even it would it would lower

4159
02:55:45,680 --> 02:55:50,520
my immunity and I wouldn't even feel

4160
02:55:47,200 --> 02:55:53,079
whole I wouldn't feel you know healthier

4161
02:55:50,520 --> 02:55:55,120
well even if I was living well otherwise

4162
02:55:53,079 --> 02:55:57,120
so I just feel like it it's the immunity

4163
02:55:55,120 --> 02:56:00,079
defense hit that it takes that's too

4164
02:55:57,120 --> 02:56:01,920
much risk these days you know so you

4165
02:56:00,079 --> 02:56:03,000
guys are trying to talk me out of

4166
02:56:01,920 --> 02:56:06,079
drinking

4167
02:56:03,000 --> 02:56:08,639
huh yeah I think I no you know what

4168
02:56:06,079 --> 02:56:12,318
actually I'm gonna just I I I want to

4169
02:56:08,639 --> 02:56:14,000
say that I think we we um we blame the

4170
02:56:12,318 --> 02:56:16,799
drug there's you know walking in the

4171
02:56:14,000 --> 02:56:19,079
smoke and being living in it now it's

4172
02:56:16,799 --> 02:56:22,679
takes an immune hit and not disagreeing

4173
02:56:19,079 --> 02:56:26,959
with you that our bodies do react to uh

4174
02:56:22,680 --> 02:56:29,279
negative um input dark it's a dark has

4175
02:56:26,959 --> 02:56:31,719
dark qualities but really the it doesn't

4176
02:56:29,279 --> 02:56:34,079
it's we that possess the dark qualities

4177
02:56:31,719 --> 02:56:36,519
and then we understood uh you know that

4178
02:56:34,079 --> 02:56:41,039
we we engage them and instead you know

4179
02:56:36,520 --> 02:56:44,120
our our we're not attending the Church

4180
02:56:41,040 --> 02:56:46,960
of of Consciousness enough you know of

4181
02:56:44,120 --> 02:56:48,880
awareness of communicating that between

4182
02:56:46,959 --> 02:56:50,358
and with one another listen listening

4183
02:56:48,879 --> 02:56:51,920
listening to One Another because we

4184
02:56:50,359 --> 02:56:53,520
always have something to say like I'm

4185
02:56:51,920 --> 02:56:56,120
saying something right now myself but

4186
02:56:53,520 --> 02:57:01,640
I'm but I just mean I think we we have

4187
02:56:56,120 --> 02:57:06,239
um we have an opportunity to take to to

4188
02:57:01,639 --> 02:57:10,000
uh dismiss the blame around the the

4189
02:57:06,238 --> 02:57:13,279
items and put it more directly where

4190
02:57:10,000 --> 02:57:16,478
sorry about my phone here

4191
02:57:13,279 --> 02:57:18,680
um to place it more take personal

4192
02:57:16,478 --> 02:57:22,559
responsibility to uh

4193
02:57:18,680 --> 02:57:26,680
address our frailties as as human beings

4194
02:57:22,559 --> 02:57:28,600
and and uh to to recognize the fraes in

4195
02:57:26,680 --> 02:57:29,880
one another Without Blame or judgment

4196
02:57:28,600 --> 02:57:32,600
and which super hard to do I'm not

4197
02:57:29,879 --> 02:57:34,959
saying I don't judge I'm a big judger

4198
02:57:32,600 --> 02:57:36,439
then you know I I think my you know have

4199
02:57:34,959 --> 02:57:38,318
I have a big ego and I you know I'm

4200
02:57:36,439 --> 02:57:40,800
trying to tame it maybe by the time I

4201
02:57:38,318 --> 02:57:42,920
really am a 100 it'll be a little more

4202
02:57:40,799 --> 02:57:45,759
under control but I'm not I'm just

4203
02:57:42,920 --> 02:57:47,719
saying so I found it was kind of

4204
02:57:45,760 --> 02:57:49,159
surprising to me that wow I'm like this

4205
02:57:47,719 --> 02:57:52,199
alcohol

4206
02:57:49,159 --> 02:57:55,318
is this is interesting but you know it's

4207
02:57:52,200 --> 02:57:58,079
not um I really think one of the most

4208
02:57:55,318 --> 02:58:00,920
important things that this isolation or

4209
02:57:58,079 --> 02:58:03,639
this period of isolation for me is the

4210
02:58:00,920 --> 02:58:06,920
the uh way that I'm absolutely stuck

4211
02:58:03,639 --> 02:58:11,519
with myself you know it's just so

4212
02:58:06,920 --> 02:58:14,318
obvious to be with me that um there it's

4213
02:58:11,520 --> 02:58:16,159
everything is magnified it's bigger it's

4214
02:58:14,318 --> 02:58:18,119
oh I'm the only one in the room what the

4215
02:58:16,159 --> 02:58:19,719
hell what the hell's going on started

4216
02:58:18,120 --> 02:58:22,239
drinking you started drinking during

4217
02:58:19,719 --> 02:58:26,119
this covid shutdown thing and well I

4218
02:58:22,238 --> 02:58:27,639
mean wait I started drinking I don't as

4219
02:58:26,120 --> 02:58:29,160
matter of fact I'm drunk now it's why I

4220
02:58:27,639 --> 02:58:32,398
don't have my that's why I dropped my

4221
02:58:29,159 --> 02:58:36,318
computer no I'm just saying I I never

4222
02:58:32,398 --> 02:58:40,478
really have been a drinker and um so

4223
02:58:36,318 --> 02:58:43,199
actually yeah I I was more speaking less

4224
02:58:40,478 --> 02:58:46,639
I was more speaking to alcohol having

4225
02:58:43,200 --> 02:58:51,000
been a medicine and that we take things

4226
02:58:46,639 --> 02:58:53,159
to a place where we devalue them and

4227
02:58:51,000 --> 02:58:56,520
while I didn't say that um I think

4228
02:58:53,159 --> 02:58:57,680
that's true that we put it uh we put the

4229
02:58:56,520 --> 02:59:01,760
a

4230
02:58:57,680 --> 02:59:03,398
spin on the things around us when really

4231
02:59:01,760 --> 02:59:05,680
it's our spin it's what's happening

4232
02:59:03,398 --> 02:59:08,039
within us that leads us to become

4233
02:59:05,680 --> 02:59:09,840
abusive to others and abuse ourselves

4234
02:59:08,040 --> 02:59:12,279
and if we're abusing ourselves and our

4235
02:59:09,840 --> 02:59:18,000
bodies Our temples this magical

4236
02:59:12,279 --> 02:59:18,000
Exquisite 50 trillion cell

4237
02:59:18,159 --> 02:59:25,039
piece of magnificence and and miraculous

4238
02:59:21,520 --> 02:59:28,880
or magical manifestation then yeah then

4239
02:59:25,040 --> 02:59:30,359
we take that to others so I don't I'm

4240
02:59:28,879 --> 02:59:32,719
just saying it's not the

4241
02:59:30,359 --> 02:59:34,479
alcohol I think I think it's tough to

4242
02:59:32,719 --> 02:59:36,920
divorce alcohol from all the baggage

4243
02:59:34,478 --> 02:59:38,639
though that comes along with it and so

4244
02:59:36,920 --> 02:59:40,318
I'm just glad that now you know with

4245
02:59:38,639 --> 02:59:42,079
cannabis and like Alex said maybe some

4246
02:59:40,318 --> 02:59:44,318
other plant medicines we're we're having

4247
02:59:42,079 --> 02:59:45,439
other options because from my

4248
02:59:44,318 --> 02:59:47,079
perspective alcohol is one of the

4249
02:59:45,439 --> 02:59:49,479
heaviest heaviest drugs out there and

4250
02:59:47,079 --> 02:59:51,000
I've tried most of them and uh yeah and

4251
02:59:49,478 --> 02:59:54,398
for it to be kind of the only option we

4252
02:59:51,000 --> 02:59:55,799
had for so long um that seem like a Wise

4253
02:59:54,398 --> 02:59:57,719
Wise Choice because there is a lot of

4254
02:59:55,799 --> 02:59:59,358
bers that comes with it um you know

4255
02:59:57,719 --> 03:00:00,478
maybe if you could take that all away

4256
02:59:59,359 --> 03:00:02,920
and experience it like you're

4257
03:00:00,478 --> 03:00:04,679
experiencing it um kind of for the first

4258
03:00:02,920 --> 03:00:06,439
time then and you could do it without

4259
03:00:04,680 --> 03:00:08,840
all that stuff I I could see where maybe

4260
03:00:06,439 --> 03:00:12,200
maybe there would be some some benefit

4261
03:00:08,840 --> 03:00:15,318
to alcohol but right yeah drugs there

4262
03:00:12,200 --> 03:00:17,200
speed there's you know there go ahead

4263
03:00:15,318 --> 03:00:19,238
well anyway go ahead well well and and

4264
03:00:17,200 --> 03:00:20,520

Empires and kind of industry and how

4276
03:00:44,398 --> 03:00:50,358
much human suffering and and and

4277
03:00:46,879 --> 03:00:52,398
violence and just destruction and just

4278
03:00:50,359 --> 03:00:53,600

like that's you know I feel like the

4281
03:00:55,040 --> 03:00:57,359
that's where these other plants are

4282
03:00:56,120 --> 03:00:59,520
coming in and all the work that you've

4283
03:00:57,359 --> 03:01:02,120
done and we are doing with cannabis and

4284
03:00:59,520 --> 03:01:04,399
helping to raise this vibration to 420

4285
03:01:02,120 --> 03:01:06,720
because we're not because now that like

4286
03:01:04,398 --> 03:01:08,398

4287
03:01:06,719 --> 03:01:10,398
this plant and we have this love and

4288
03:01:08,398 --> 03:01:12,599
reverence for this plant and the work

4289
03:01:10,398 --> 03:01:14,358
we're doing with it is now helping to

4290
03:01:12,600 --> 03:01:16,520
spiritually forklift so many of our

4291
03:01:14,359 --> 03:01:19,479
friends and family that are in these

4292
03:01:16,520 --> 03:01:21,800
states of pure abuse and suffering and

4293
03:01:19,478 --> 03:01:26,278
use of you know alcohol as the only

4294
03:01:21,799 --> 03:01:28,719
medicine or in their case pure poison to

4295
03:01:26,279 --> 03:01:30,720
to to further destroy their life whereas

4296
03:01:28,719 --> 03:01:33,039
kind of we know these other plants are

4297
03:01:30,719 --> 03:01:35,318
available to expand our repertoire you

4298
03:01:33,040 --> 03:01:37,359
know in our medicine portfolio because

4299
03:01:35,318 --> 03:01:39,519
it's like poisons and medicines and it's

4300
03:01:37,359 --> 03:01:41,279
like what do you choose to invive in and

4301
03:01:39,520 --> 03:01:43,120
you know kind of cannabis you know where

4302
03:01:41,279 --> 03:01:44,920
we see this benefit we bringing this

4303
03:01:43,120 --> 03:01:46,880
benefit out to the world and you know I

4304
03:01:44,920 --> 03:01:49,520
feel like we're we need to be the the

4305
03:01:46,879 --> 03:01:51,839
spiritual and psychedelic astronauts

4306
03:01:49,520 --> 03:01:54,760
that we are to continue that you know

4307
03:01:51,840 --> 03:01:56,120
kind of leveling up to 720 and Beyond

4308
03:01:54,760 --> 03:01:57,760
you know to help bring these other

4309
03:01:56,120 --> 03:01:59,319
medicines that are so needed in this

4310
03:01:57,760 --> 03:02:01,639
level this moment of suffering you know

4311
03:01:59,318 --> 03:02:03,039
like iasa peyote all these you know

4312
03:02:01,639 --> 03:02:04,719
indigenous rights of Passage and

4313
03:02:03,040 --> 03:02:06,640
traditions that are you know

4314
03:02:04,719 --> 03:02:08,478
purposefully supposed their their

4315
03:02:06,639 --> 03:02:10,039
purpose is to help heal and alleviate

4316
03:02:08,478 --> 03:02:12,358
the trauma and suffering of the past and

4317
03:02:10,040 --> 03:02:14,200
your ancestry and and so it's like

4318
03:02:12,359 --> 03:02:16,120
alcohol is not going to do that but you

4319
03:02:14,200 --> 03:02:18,760
know starting to work with other plants

4320
03:02:16,120 --> 03:02:20,840
you know can get you to a point I in in

4321
03:02:18,760 --> 03:02:24,840
life where you can you know kind of not

4322
03:02:20,840 --> 03:02:26,439
over leverage one plant or poison Ally

4323
03:02:24,840 --> 03:02:28,318
that you have in your life over another

4324
03:02:26,439 --> 03:02:30,079
but but to to to really just have

4325
03:02:28,318 --> 03:02:31,719
reverence for the plants and for the

4326
03:02:30,079 --> 03:02:33,680
what you put in your body and yeah that

4327
03:02:31,719 --> 03:02:35,238
in fact your body is the temple yeah

4328
03:02:33,680 --> 03:02:38,120
that's the reverence point and and

4329
03:02:35,238 --> 03:02:42,000
actually it's quite interesting because

4330
03:02:38,120 --> 03:02:46,439
um ex I've not many times and learned

4331
03:02:42,000 --> 03:02:49,520
this really from uh primarily time at

4332
03:02:46,439 --> 03:02:52,520
repeated um that people with neuropathic

4333
03:02:49,520 --> 03:02:55,920
pain it's it's extremely difficult

4334
03:02:52,520 --> 03:02:58,960
to uh minimize neuropathic pain it's

4335
03:02:55,920 --> 03:03:02,520
quite difficult and and it's hard to to

4336
03:02:58,959 --> 03:03:05,839
get ahead of it um without being really

4337
03:03:02,520 --> 03:03:08,960
drugged and some very interesting pieces

4338
03:03:05,840 --> 03:03:12,200
of information whereby uh delivered to

4339
03:03:08,959 --> 03:03:15,278
me uh through patients who are allergic

4340
03:03:12,200 --> 03:03:17,000
to opiates which uh you know can

4341
03:03:15,279 --> 03:03:20,359
complicate the problem because you can

4342
03:03:17,000 --> 03:03:23,318
often use cannabis with other drugs to

4343
03:03:20,359 --> 03:03:25,359
uh step away from the pain and then once

4344
03:03:23,318 --> 03:03:26,639
you're out of the suff the sufferings

4345
03:03:25,359 --> 03:03:27,800
out of the pain you can deal with the

4346
03:03:26,639 --> 03:03:31,199
pain but the suffering is what

4347
03:03:27,799 --> 03:03:34,079
overwhelms and many folks have told me

4348
03:03:31,200 --> 03:03:38,279
that applying or adding a small amount

4349
03:03:34,079 --> 03:03:40,120
of alcohol really helps to uh minimize

4350
03:03:38,279 --> 03:03:43,399
that so you know when you Le I I think

4351
03:03:40,120 --> 03:03:46,079
what we villainize the things around us

4352
03:03:43,398 --> 03:03:47,799
and not I mean I've known a lot of

4353
03:03:46,079 --> 03:03:50,318
drunks that have driven me crazy as

4354
03:03:47,799 --> 03:03:52,759
matter of fact I had to ask somebody to

4355
03:03:50,318 --> 03:03:55,760
leave this place because you know really

4356
03:03:52,760 --> 03:03:58,079
couldn't the behavior surrounding

4357
03:03:55,760 --> 03:04:02,719
alcohol abuse was you know too much for

4358
03:03:58,079 --> 03:04:05,600
for me so so whatever that's I it's the

4359
03:04:02,719 --> 03:04:08,199
way that we you know it's just a

4360
03:04:05,600 --> 03:04:09,800
personal responsibility and and you know

4361
03:04:08,200 --> 03:04:12,359
whether or not people can manage to look

4362
03:04:09,799 --> 03:04:16,799
at ourselves that's it's not no small

4363
03:04:12,359 --> 03:04:18,079
task right so and um and I like to play

4364
03:04:16,799 --> 03:04:22,199
I don't know if it's the dev Devil's

4365
03:04:18,079 --> 03:04:24,760
Advocate but I I like to stand on this

4366
03:04:22,200 --> 03:04:26,600
side where no you know where nobody's

4367
03:04:24,760 --> 03:04:29,040
standing because I think I do think

4368
03:04:26,600 --> 03:04:30,640
alcohol has value and I've seen it work

4369
03:04:29,040 --> 03:04:32,880
and have recommended it to people like

4370
03:04:30,639 --> 03:04:37,199
have you tried to drink you know because

4371
03:04:32,879 --> 03:04:40,599
pain is so um pervasive and minimizes

4372
03:04:37,200 --> 03:04:43,120
life it minim s suffering takes the joy

4373
03:04:40,600 --> 03:04:48,159
the pleasure out of life and you it is

4374
03:04:43,120 --> 03:04:51,479
so difficult to use pain to transcend as

4375
03:04:48,159 --> 03:04:54,359
a Transcendent tool it can be and I've

4376
03:04:51,478 --> 03:04:57,000
had the experience twice in my life once

4377
03:04:54,359 --> 03:04:59,640
with cannabis and pain and once with an

4378
03:04:57,000 --> 03:05:01,559
extreme amount of pain to be able to

4379
03:04:59,639 --> 03:05:05,760
only twice and I'm old and had a lot of

4380
03:05:01,559 --> 03:05:09,359
pain you know so like um I I feel like

4381
03:05:05,760 --> 03:05:14,478
only two times could I ride the pain to

4382
03:05:09,359 --> 03:05:16,159
another expression or experience now um

4383
03:05:14,478 --> 03:05:19,840
neither of those was with alcohol to be

4384
03:05:16,159 --> 03:05:23,079
honest this is more of a new trend so um

4385
03:05:19,840 --> 03:05:25,760
and um I just think that we we have a

4386
03:05:23,079 --> 03:05:27,959
tendency to I do I don't know whatever

4387
03:05:25,760 --> 03:05:30,359
what y'all are doing but I do I have a

4388
03:05:27,959 --> 03:05:32,039
tendency to look at the object and

4389
03:05:30,359 --> 03:05:34,439
whether it's the object of Desire or

4390
03:05:32,040 --> 03:05:37,520
repulsion it's still the object and it's

4391
03:05:34,439 --> 03:05:40,159
not really the it's not really the point

4392
03:05:37,520 --> 03:05:42,920
right it's not really the point is it so

4393
03:05:40,159 --> 03:05:44,879
well said Valerie absolutely agree with

4394
03:05:42,920 --> 03:05:46,359
all that you said there and I just

4395
03:05:44,879 --> 03:05:48,039
happen to sit on the other side of the

4396
03:05:46,359 --> 03:05:51,720
fence where I'm I'm more like like you

4397
03:05:48,040 --> 03:05:54,399
know I see I see Christianity going into

4398
03:05:51,719 --> 03:05:56,679
every culture and just and ripping out

4399
03:05:54,398 --> 03:05:59,559
their plant sacraments and replacing it

4400
03:05:56,680 --> 03:06:02,439
with their plant their Sacrament wine

4401
03:05:59,559 --> 03:06:04,760
the blood of Christ alcohol and I see

4402
03:06:02,439 --> 03:06:07,680
what alcohol seems to have done to

4403
03:06:04,760 --> 03:06:09,800
indigenous populations around the world

4404
03:06:07,680 --> 03:06:12,520
and I just have such a hard time

4405
03:06:09,799 --> 03:06:14,639
accepting it as you know I'm not saying

4406
03:06:12,520 --> 03:06:16,520
get rid of alcohol Forever by any means

4407
03:06:14,639 --> 03:06:18,959
I just think that it's so pervasive and

4408
03:06:16,520 --> 03:06:21,159
it's so promoted and people seem to not

4409
03:06:18,959 --> 03:06:23,959
even know how to gather without having

4410
03:06:21,159 --> 03:06:26,760
it around and become so dependent on and

4411
03:06:23,959 --> 03:06:29,159
it causes so much pain that uh I don't

4412
03:06:26,760 --> 03:06:31,359
know how to remove that I mean I get

4413
03:06:29,159 --> 03:06:33,760
that there's root causes of everyone's

4414
03:06:31,359 --> 03:06:36,000
pain is in rooted in trauma that they've

4415
03:06:33,760 --> 03:06:38,359
had probably as a child and of course if

4416
03:06:36,000 --> 03:06:40,879
we all looked inside of one another etc

4417
03:06:38,359 --> 03:06:42,318
etc I get all that but at the same time

4418
03:06:40,879 --> 03:06:43,879
I think maybe life would just be a

4419
03:06:42,318 --> 03:06:46,559
little bit better if that [ __ ] wasn't

4420
03:06:43,879 --> 03:06:51,199
available on every single Street Corner

4421
03:06:46,559 --> 03:06:51,199
in every single City it's just so

4422
03:06:51,238 --> 03:06:57,439
pervasive yeah a tool of Oppression for

4423
03:06:54,680 --> 03:07:00,720
sure alcohol is part of Canadian culture

4424
03:06:57,439 --> 03:07:04,040
right I mean you know uh during provis

4425
03:07:00,719 --> 03:07:06,679
here in the US a lot of booze came in

4426
03:07:04,040 --> 03:07:09,640
from Canada so there was a supply chain

4427
03:07:06,680 --> 03:07:11,238
that was created and the thing that

4428
03:07:09,639 --> 03:07:13,159
always bothers me especially when they

4429
03:07:11,238 --> 03:07:17,000
make the comparison to our industry

4430
03:07:13,159 --> 03:07:19,039
cannabis yeah is how double standard it

4431
03:07:17,000 --> 03:07:22,398
is like with advertising and everything

4432
03:07:19,040 --> 03:07:23,399
and how alcohol consumption is glorified

4433
03:07:22,398 --> 03:07:26,639
around

4434
03:07:23,398 --> 03:07:31,079
sporting uh things and just the whole

4435
03:07:26,639 --> 03:07:34,719
alcohol culture and alcohol mentality of

4436
03:07:31,079 --> 03:07:37,279
consumption and um and the behavior that

4437
03:07:34,719 --> 03:07:39,438
supposedly hey if I drink a Coors Light

4438
03:07:37,279 --> 03:07:41,880
I'm G to have all these Scandal clad

4439
03:07:39,439 --> 03:07:44,479
women around the pool with me and oh

4440
03:07:41,879 --> 03:07:47,159
that's cool yet you know cannabis can't

4441
03:07:44,478 --> 03:07:49,318
even get you know a commercial during

4442
03:07:47,159 --> 03:07:51,439
the Super Bowl I mean it's it's well

4443
03:07:49,318 --> 03:07:53,359
wait a minute when when it does it will

4444
03:07:51,439 --> 03:07:55,238
have the scantily Cloud women that's

4445
03:07:53,359 --> 03:07:58,399
what's already

4446
03:07:55,238 --> 03:08:01,600
happening that's not far we that's I

4447
03:07:58,398 --> 03:08:04,719
still if you looked at acreage acreage

4448
03:08:01,600 --> 03:08:07,520
did have a a commercial that they paid a

4449
03:08:04,719 --> 03:08:10,199
big Ad Agency all ready to sort of pitch

4450
03:08:07,520 --> 03:08:12,520
to to do Super Bowl advertising and they

4451
03:08:10,200 --> 03:08:15,520
were shot down by the network but the

4452
03:08:12,520 --> 03:08:18,120
point is is that yeah we the there's

4453
03:08:15,520 --> 03:08:22,260
such an unfair landscape

4454
03:08:18,120 --> 03:08:23,880
in between the glorification of alcohol

4455
03:08:22,260 --> 03:08:26,079
[Music]

4456
03:08:23,879 --> 03:08:28,278
consumption and what they've done to

4457
03:08:26,079 --> 03:08:30,159
demonize cannabis consumption and I

4458
03:08:28,279 --> 03:08:31,120
think there to me I'm Marcus I don't

4459
03:08:30,159 --> 03:08:33,359
know if this is the way you feel again

4460
03:08:31,120 --> 03:08:36,079
being Canadian I mean I I I I just feel

4461
03:08:33,359 --> 03:08:38,318
that man there's too much alcohol you we

4462
03:08:36,079 --> 03:08:40,719
don't need more people drinking alcohol

4463
03:08:38,318 --> 03:08:44,278
I love a craft beer and I certainly love

4464
03:08:40,719 --> 03:08:46,799
my single Mal Scotch but I I you know

4465
03:08:44,279 --> 03:08:49,479
what I'll abstain from alcohol use if it

4466
03:08:46,799 --> 03:08:51,519
means making cannabis use fully legal

4467
03:08:49,478 --> 03:08:53,358
and accessible to everybody well I'm

4468
03:08:51,520 --> 03:08:55,439
certainly not a prohibitionist and I

4469
03:08:53,359 --> 03:08:56,800
certainly wasn't saying prohibit alcohol

4470
03:08:55,439 --> 03:08:59,000
I was just saying don't make it

4471
03:08:56,799 --> 03:09:01,079
available on every single street corner

4472
03:08:59,000 --> 03:09:03,398
like everywhere just like booze booze

4473
03:09:01,079 --> 03:09:07,879
booze don't let like like it seems to

4474
03:09:03,398 --> 03:09:10,079
have a ve a fairly low ld50 number and

4475
03:09:07,879 --> 03:09:12,199
yet it just is in everyone's house

4476
03:09:10,079 --> 03:09:13,478
without being protected it's just like

4477
03:09:12,200 --> 03:09:15,239
there's oh there's little babies and

4478

little toddlers and oh I've got enough

4479
03:09:15,238 --> 03:09:20,680
alcohol here to kill like five children

4480
03:09:17,478 --> 03:09:23,679
an ld50 Mark right yeah well that's what

4481
03:09:20,680 --> 03:09:25,680
I'm saying well it is it is one of the

4482
03:09:23,680 --> 03:09:28,279
Matrix tools you know I mean just like

4483
03:09:25,680 --> 03:09:31,680
the amount of I mean you know to me

4484
03:09:28,279 --> 03:09:35,159
what's just soed is just this like Cy of

4485
03:09:31,680 --> 03:09:38,040
almost just drone that happens from the

4486
03:09:35,159 --> 03:09:40,318
food system poisoning us the Reliance on

4487
03:09:38,040 --> 03:09:43,760
the Pharmaceuticals that then drawn us

4488
03:09:40,318 --> 03:09:46,199
out further and then it turns out that b

4489
03:09:43,760 --> 03:09:48,279
are owned by the same people you know

4490
03:09:46,200 --> 03:09:49,760
making the poisons that are liate

4491
03:09:48,279 --> 03:09:51,159
killing our microbiome and then you know

4492
03:09:49,760 --> 03:09:53,000
kind of Bayer selling the you know

4493
03:09:51,159 --> 03:09:54,520
Pharmaceuticals to make us better and

4494
03:09:53,000 --> 03:09:57,760
then you know and then the recreational

4495
03:09:54,520 --> 03:10:00,640
drug of choice is then tobacco with you

4496
03:09:57,760 --> 03:10:02,439
know as well as alcohol and tobacco you

4497
03:10:00,639 --> 03:10:04,920
know the way tobacco is used is one of

4498
03:10:02,439 --> 03:10:07,200
the greatest crimes against humanity you

4499
03:10:04,920 --> 03:10:09,520
know they call it the red man's curse

4500
03:10:07,200 --> 03:10:11,960
you know and and is it's taken this one

4501
03:10:09,520 --> 03:10:15,560
of the greatest most prayed upon

4502
03:10:11,959 --> 03:10:17,839
sacraments and herbs to to use in a

4503
03:10:15,559 --> 03:10:20,478
specific way to pray

4504
03:10:17,840 --> 03:10:22,840
and to amplify your prayer out into the

4505
03:10:20,478 --> 03:10:24,959
universe and we took it and we

4506
03:10:22,840 --> 03:10:27,040
completely raped it sprayed it with all

4507
03:10:24,959 --> 03:10:29,000
the poisons and chemicals you know of

4508
03:10:27,040 --> 03:10:31,640
World War II and kind of death and

4509
03:10:29,000 --> 03:10:34,680
pesticides and poison and created an

4510
03:10:31,639 --> 03:10:36,840
industry around smoking as you stress on

4511
03:10:34,680 --> 03:10:38,680
life and taking smoke breaks and amplify

4512
03:10:36,840 --> 03:10:40,238
and you're you're not you don't use the

4513
03:10:38,680 --> 03:10:42,520
tobacco in the way that it's supposed to

4514
03:10:40,238 --> 03:10:44,478
be used you use it in a way to amplify

4515
03:10:42,520 --> 03:10:46,720
the destructive power of tobacco of your

4516
03:10:44,478 --> 03:10:47,760
body and and so it's like you know

4517
03:10:46,719 --> 03:10:50,238
between

4518
03:10:47,760 --> 03:10:52,600
the the way tobacco and alcohol have

4519
03:10:50,238 --> 03:10:55,680
been fetishized you know for for you

4520
03:10:52,600 --> 03:10:58,800
know kind of as as as the alleviators of

4521
03:10:55,680 --> 03:11:01,159
stress and and the tools for us to you

4522
03:10:58,799 --> 03:11:03,278
know chill out after a hard day at work

4523
03:11:01,159 --> 03:11:05,079
you know I think those combined with the

4524
03:11:03,279 --> 03:11:06,840
food system that's poisoned is just one

4525
03:11:05,079 --> 03:11:10,478
of the greatest crimes against humanity

4526
03:11:06,840 --> 03:11:12,880
and this Matrix out drone drones that's

4527
03:11:10,478 --> 03:11:14,478
led to kind of so much in suffering and

4528
03:11:12,879 --> 03:11:16,000
and that's where yeah I feel like and I

4529
03:11:14,478 --> 03:11:17,599
agree with you Marcus you know cannabis

4530
03:11:16,000 --> 03:11:20,920
you know I mean in so many ways it's

4531
03:11:17,600 --> 03:11:22,399
like it's you know it's the yeah leveler

4532
03:11:20,920 --> 03:11:24,840
up in that way and I feel like bringing

4533
03:11:22,398 --> 03:11:26,278
up the frequency and the vibration and

4534
03:11:24,840 --> 03:11:28,520
and the level of suffering and healing

4535
03:11:26,279 --> 03:11:31,600
and so you know bring it down and then

4536
03:11:28,520 --> 03:11:33,479
it brings way for the other plants but

4537
03:11:31,600 --> 03:11:35,640
it's yeah it's it's it's a trip because

4538
03:11:33,478 --> 03:11:39,559
you tobacco same way it's been used in

4539
03:11:35,639 --> 03:11:42,238
such a profoundly um dishonest or not or

4540
03:11:39,559 --> 03:11:43,879
dis disrespectful way and and and way

4541
03:11:42,238 --> 03:11:45,920
that you know I mean tobacco hasn't

4542
03:11:43,879 --> 03:11:48,199
killed kind of the people in the way I

4543
03:11:45,920 --> 03:11:50,238
mean the way it's used in Pape in Brazil

4544
03:11:48,200 --> 03:11:52,200
the tobacco snuffs that's used the the

4545
03:11:50,238 --> 03:11:53,840
wayi mapacho and and North North

4546
03:11:52,200 --> 03:11:55,760
American South American you know

4547
03:11:53,840 --> 03:11:57,200
indigenous tradition it's like very very

4548
03:11:55,760 --> 03:12:00,279
different

4549
03:11:57,200 --> 03:12:02,520
plant I think that that it won't be too

4550
03:12:00,279 --> 03:12:05,560
long before we see cannabis advertised

4551
03:12:02,520 --> 03:12:07,960
in the way that both well tobacco less

4552
03:12:05,559 --> 03:12:10,959
of course now but alcohol the way that

4553
03:12:07,959 --> 03:12:13,919
it's it's advertised and the kind of um

4554
03:12:10,959 --> 03:12:15,039
relationship that's created by um a

4555
03:12:13,920 --> 03:12:18,359
corporate

4556
03:12:15,040 --> 03:12:21,560
infrastructure that supports this a

4557
03:12:18,359 --> 03:12:23,600
specific typee of advertising it's to

4558
03:12:21,559 --> 03:12:27,119
reach as many people to sell as much

4559
03:12:23,600 --> 03:12:30,318
product and so as long as we I think uh

4560
03:12:27,120 --> 03:12:34,760
as long as we are not um self-reflective

4561
03:12:30,318 --> 03:12:39,039
and not looking at not

4562
03:12:34,760 --> 03:12:41,680
uh productizing marketing um the what is

4563
03:12:39,040 --> 03:12:43,080
it that we're selling so I mean I think

4564
03:12:41,680 --> 03:12:47,398
that that's obviously that's what

4565
03:12:43,079 --> 03:12:49,639
happened with uh with alcohol and I mean

4566
03:12:47,398 --> 03:12:53,879
I I don't know I don't smoke cigarettes

4567
03:12:49,639 --> 03:12:55,478
but you know I smoke pot and um so I I I

4568
03:12:53,879 --> 03:12:58,119
I mean I just think that

4569
03:12:55,478 --> 03:12:59,879
we I'm not going to say that I haven't

4570
03:12:58,120 --> 03:13:02,880
known some bad drunks because I

4571
03:12:59,879 --> 03:13:04,759
certainly have and um never seem to try

4572
03:13:02,879 --> 03:13:07,799
it does that doesn't seem so attractive

4573
03:13:04,760 --> 03:13:10,520
to me I've uh but

4574
03:13:07,799 --> 03:13:12,519
I but I really question the way that we

4575
03:13:10,520 --> 03:13:16,200
look at the world around us and the way

4576
03:13:12,520 --> 03:13:18,720
that we um engage with with the the

4577
03:13:16,200 --> 03:13:21,359
things that we do I a wee but me you

4578
03:13:18,719 --> 03:13:25,079
know the way I do way I look at myself

4579
03:13:21,359 --> 03:13:28,840
and what I buy and how how it is sold to

4580
03:13:25,079 --> 03:13:33,318
me and and I see I see cannabis as very

4581
03:13:28,840 --> 03:13:37,680
paralleling alcohol and um very soon you

4582
03:13:33,318 --> 03:13:39,959
know the next big uh what is it that you

4583
03:13:37,680 --> 03:13:41,680
what game were we just played what game

4584
03:13:39,959 --> 03:13:44,799
was supposed to have been played that

4585
03:13:41,680 --> 03:13:46,920
that this was it the Super Bowl is that

4586
03:13:44,799 --> 03:13:47,599
what you were saying Mark Super Bowl

4587
03:13:46,920 --> 03:13:49,559
yeah

4588
03:13:47,600 --> 03:13:51,000
yeah Super Bowl sorry I'm not a sports

4589
03:13:49,559 --> 03:13:54,799
guy but

4590
03:13:51,000 --> 03:13:56,920
um you know it's just it's just we we

4591
03:13:54,799 --> 03:13:59,879
have take responsibility we also have to

4592
03:13:56,920 --> 03:14:03,120
call out responsibility on on the

4593
03:13:59,879 --> 03:14:07,199
marketing the way that cannabis is being

4594
03:14:03,120 --> 03:14:11,040
um um marketed and the way it's being

4595
03:14:07,200 --> 03:14:13,159
absconded and and the Viewpoint you know

4596
03:14:11,040 --> 03:14:16,120
I mean if you open a magazine and look

4597
03:14:13,159 --> 03:14:18,478
at cannabis the way it's sold is very

4598
03:14:16,120 --> 03:14:20,239
much the way that Al is sold and that's

4599
03:14:18,478 --> 03:14:22,519
so you know kind of getting less and

4600
03:14:20,238 --> 03:14:25,680
less I mean we're seeing different kinds

4601
03:14:22,520 --> 03:14:26,920
of marketing occurring but but you know

4602
03:14:25,680 --> 03:14:30,279
I guess the question is really what do

4603
03:14:26,920 --> 03:14:33,478
we want to sell and what do we want to

4604
03:14:30,279 --> 03:14:37,000
buy and um who do we buy it from you

4605
03:14:33,478 --> 03:14:40,278
know that's my I have a much bigger um

4606
03:14:37,000 --> 03:14:43,359
uh you know I want to make am I want to

4607
03:14:40,279 --> 03:14:45,720
Prohibition for Amazon you know to me

4608
03:14:43,359 --> 03:14:47,640
one of the dark that's the dark side

4609
03:14:45,719 --> 03:14:51,278
it's not what you drink

4610
03:14:47,639 --> 03:14:53,318
it's where does it come from who makes

4611
03:14:51,279 --> 03:14:54,359
it how do they make it who suffers

4612
03:14:53,318 --> 03:14:57,238
because of

4613
03:14:54,359 --> 03:14:58,840
it what is the service that's being done

4614
03:14:57,238 --> 03:15:01,039
are we serving ourselves our planet the

4615
03:14:58,840 --> 03:15:03,559
people that we work with are we serving

4616
03:15:01,040 --> 03:15:05,920
what what do we serve and um and the

4617
03:15:03,559 --> 03:15:08,639
people that and who do we serve so right

4618
03:15:05,920 --> 03:15:11,719
now we a lot of us serve Amazon and we

4619
03:15:08,639 --> 03:15:13,639
serve a very dark Mission and just save

4620
03:15:11,719 --> 03:15:16,438
I don't know a buck or5 dollars or a

4621
03:15:13,639 --> 03:15:18,639
thousand or whatever so and there are

4622
03:15:16,439 --> 03:15:19,880
other ways do it and all of it is linked

4623
03:15:18,639 --> 03:15:21,398
and you guys are right I mean I'm not

4624
03:15:19,879 --> 03:15:23,238
going to I'm going to bust out my bottle

4625
03:15:21,398 --> 03:15:27,639
in a second now that's why you can't see

4626
03:15:23,238 --> 03:15:30,760
me I I'm totally kidding um so I I just

4627
03:15:27,639 --> 03:15:33,198
think those there are so many really big

4628
03:15:30,760 --> 03:15:35,398
questions and it's all linked it's all

4629
03:15:33,199 --> 03:15:37,399
linked to just everything with it's the

4630
03:15:35,398 --> 03:15:39,799
micro rizone we're talking about it

4631
03:15:37,398 --> 03:15:42,519
right here but what and what how does

4632
03:15:39,799 --> 03:15:46,079
that extend to every single thing that

4633
03:15:42,520 --> 03:15:48,359
we take in that we everything that we do

4634
03:15:46,079 --> 03:15:51,159
our actions

4635
03:15:48,359 --> 03:15:53,318
every puff we take every breath we
