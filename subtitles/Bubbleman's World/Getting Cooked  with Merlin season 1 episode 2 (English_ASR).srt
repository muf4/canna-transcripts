a bad place to go in the next few days i

99
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,319
wouldn't climb up and go anywhere near

100
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:17,680
the actual waterfall but i would enjoy

101
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:19,120
it from under you know the bottom

102
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,280
there's a shower at the bottom from a

103
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,280
distance you know in the summer i go in

104
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,959
it when it's like dribbling but the way

105
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:26,799
it is right now

106
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,638
you wouldn't want to go in there

107
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,360
two summers ago didn't some guys fall

108
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:33,360
off yeah some uh some youtubers they

109
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,360
were going up there into the top pools

110
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,919
yeah and i guess the girl i think it was

111
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,759
the girl lost control and you know was

112
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:41,599
sliding over and then the guy went to

113
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,919
jump and grab her and he went over too

114
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,960
it was really a nightmare yeah

115
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:49,599
everyone's trying to get those views

116
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:51,599
that's some stellar views for

117
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,800
exactly that's insane yeah i don't think

118
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,240
you'd be enjoying that that's not the

119
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,960
way you want him he wouldn't be enjoying

120
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,960
it though in his

121
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,840
those last 30 seconds that's uh some

122
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,879
hindu

123
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:05,879
some older high school

124
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,079
yeah it's interesting huh yeah

125
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,560
i don't actually know where i got that

126
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:20,478
but it's pretty satisfying

127
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,519
yeah it's got a [ __ ] nose too that's

128
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:22,879
for sure

129
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:25,120
you guys have a lot in common in the

130
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:26,959
sense that patty also just loves to cook

131
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,879
and make food and he's always just

132
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:30,719
busting out things with

133
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:33,279
that's what stoner's like today i said

134
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,039
yeah right i sent him the videos

135
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:37,038
i can hang out with your buddy

136
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:38,719
let's do it people ask me they're like

137
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:41,839
do do you cook for professionals like no

138
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,840
i just smoked a lot of weed

139
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,120
you know that's kind of where it goes

140
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,639
yeah it does indeed

141
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,160
and once you eat really good food it's

142
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,038
hard to go back

143
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,199
true

144
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:54,319
you know nice husky

145
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,600
yeah that's pretty cool yeah that is

146
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:57,759
really cool i've never noticed that on

147
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:01,600
this pipe before it goes straight like

148
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:03,280
milly husky oh yeah that's awesome

149
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,479
well when they sold it they said it was

150
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:06,478

151
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:08,240
the lone wolf yeah here i got to show it

152
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:10,000
to the camera i'm just gonna say well

153
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,720

155
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:18,560

160
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,840
get to what's important

161
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,840
the cooking

162
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:37,038

166
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:45,918
literally patty just was saying how he'd

167
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,319
never made these types of sandwiches but

168
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:49,839
he was just like last week googling the

have a joint line out the whole time but

203

the knife right

209
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:51,759

yeah instead of like tearing into the

211
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:55,039
ginger with a knife and losing a whole

212

bunch yeah you're not losing any no it

213
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:59,919

into fairly big chunks yeah we're going

219

220
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,919
blender anyway

chanterelles

all year

289
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,120
until like december january i think

290
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,200
we'll see let's keep let's try picking

291
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,039
them all here yeah seriously

292
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,120
make a new meal every week for like

293
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:43,278
three months

294
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:46,399
slice up our tofu

295
00:12:43,278 --> 00:12:46,399
okay a little tofu

296
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,278
squeeze that water out

297
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,120
i used to always think it was some sort

298
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:57,919
of solution but it's literally just

299
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,919
water okay

300
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,839
like what are they putting in to make it

301
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,000
better it's like oh it's water it's like

302
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:07,120
that's the tofu solution

303
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,879
i don't know about that in a sense it is

304
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,919
a solution because without it it'll dry

305
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:11,679
out

306
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:15,439
yeah i guess you're right

307
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:18,638
just not the solution you were thinking

308
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,639
it's a double entendre

309
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:23,040
yeah

310
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,120
so tasty

311
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:26,159
probably not the best food

312
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,240
what's that

313
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:29,838
soy is probably not the best for you but

314
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,879
it tastes delicious

315
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:35,120

323
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,839

giving them a turn

620
00:27:11,038 --> 00:27:14,879
they're just like perfectly french

621
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,798
toasted yeah they do like their french

622
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:19,039
things they really do

623
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:20,398
little french toasts

624
00:27:19,038 --> 00:27:22,158
if you told someone this was french

625
00:27:20,398 --> 00:27:23,359
toast and then put syrup on it they'd be

626
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:24,559
surprised

627
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:27,439
you just tell them they don't know the

628
00:27:24,558 --> 00:27:27,440
syrup's already in there

629
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:33,119
infused like mcdonald's in the griddle

630
00:27:30,558 --> 00:27:35,200
exactly i don't know what that means but

631
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:38,879
we had like a wicked yeah well is that

632
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:41,919
what it was i don't know i don't know

633
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,919
butter in the buns

634
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,038
and so we're doing this why

635
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,720
just so they crisps up and gets nice and

636
00:27:49,038 --> 00:27:53,200
golden brown and we put it in the oven

637
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:55,278
okay that's the key right yeah we'll

638
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,840
we'll remember these

639
00:27:55,278 --> 00:27:59,599
butter makes everything better

640
00:27:57,839 --> 00:28:01,119
yes

641
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:04,000
i go through a ridiculous amount of

642
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:05,678
butter on the weekly i bet you do

643
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,759
putting it on the inside the outside

644
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:09,840
you're like i'll be boiling using butter

645
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:14,038
and frying them in butter we could poach

646
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:14,038
the tofu and butter next time

647
00:28:16,398 --> 00:28:20,079
awesome that's what you want on the

648
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,519
bunny though right the nice crisp exact

649
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:24,000
crunch when you're biting into it

650
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:24,000
totally

651
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:30,158

this is just ridiculous at this point

655
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:46,398
it smells so good it really does

656
00:28:44,398 --> 00:28:49,278
it's a nice

657
00:28:46,398 --> 00:28:49,278
tofu meal

658
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:54,399
i can't mess around with good tofu

659
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,520
there's definitely a lot of bad tofu out

660
00:28:54,398 --> 00:28:57,839
there

661
00:28:55,519 --> 00:29:00,158
yeah i i find for i don't really like

662
00:28:57,839 --> 00:29:01,759
soft tofu as much i like frying paste

663
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:03,840
yeah

664
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:05,679
soft tofu is really weird actually it

665
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:08,240
just kind of feels like pudding it's

666
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:10,480
like solid pudding

667
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:12,159
i'm out hard to get that stuff crispy it

668
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,079
just kind of turns into scrambled rum my

669
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:16,159
baby in there i feel like i need my

670
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:17,678
beverage because these guys are slipping

671
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:19,520
their beverage and

672
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:21,120
although they're drinking beers i am

673
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:23,519
drinking water

674
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:27,839
even though it looks like it's vodka

675
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:27,839
this was vodka and i did this

676
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,600

818
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,480
a traditional fashion when you learn how

819

to smoke hash is the old hot knife i can

820
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,358

00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:46,960
the

822

or the coal or the flipped knife right

824
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,359
the double

825
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:53,200

826
00:34:51,358 --> 00:34:55,119
two knives on there and you you grab it

and then push them together

828
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:59,200
oh yeah we used to do that hot knives

829
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,880
that was classic we did we did

830
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:02,399

831
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,838

834
00:35:05,838 --> 00:35:08,799
bubbling and melting

835
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:14,960

00:35:23,199 --> 00:35:26,159
and i was being

843
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,680
kind of silly

844
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:29,279
and you know we were feeding the whiskey

845
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:31,039
jacks and everything and i gave him a

846
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,119
little morsel of food on top of the hash

847
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:35,039
ball and didn't really think about it

848
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:36,720
he grabbed it he grabbed it he ate it he

849
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:38,000
flew off but i just

850
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:39,759
i didn't think about it at the time

851
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,880
right but later on the day and i'm like

852
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,640

854
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:46,559
the best time of his life or he's

855
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:49,039

like this

1037
00:43:48,719 --> 00:43:52,559
and just close it

1038
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:54,400
just like that and then you can take

1039
00:43:52,559 --> 00:43:56,880
your knife and kind of stack it all in

1040
