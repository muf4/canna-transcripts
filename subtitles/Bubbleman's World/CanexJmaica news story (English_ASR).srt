cannabis Licensing Authority CLA is

8
00:00:18,989 --> 00:00:23,219
causing headaches

9
00:00:20,309 --> 00:00:25,589
one such headache they point to is the

10
00:00:23,219 --> 00:00:29,698
fee they're apt to pay it just to start

11
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:33,019
up this clear this is far beyond us look

12
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:35,789
at the before planting a seed of ganja

leaves a million are to realize before

being considered eligible for a license

15
00:00:38,128 --> 00:00:43,049
a ganja farm should be properly fenced

16
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:46,319
and surveillance cameras must be

17
00:00:43,049 --> 00:00:49,649
installed for many small farmers the

18
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,509
cost to do so is exorbitant Delano Steve

Wright is a director at the cannabis

20
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:56,039
licensing authority it's expensive not

21
00:00:53,729 --> 00:00:59,369
deliberately it's expensive because the

22
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:01,469
process here cost money and it has to be

23
00:00:59,369 --> 00:01:03,718
very stringent what laws would have to

24
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:04,978
be in compliance with international law

25
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:07,530
have to be in compliance with the UN

26
00:01:04,978 --> 00:01:10,438
conventions what we're working a

27
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:13,799
solution right now we have the ability

28
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:15,929
to the farmers to defer their payments

29
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:18,630
but the fee isn't the only thing the

30
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:20,610
farmers are taking issue with some are

31
00:01:18,629 --> 00:01:23,819
of the view that the industry is

32
00:01:20,609 --> 00:01:26,368
designed to favor big investors but at

33
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:28,828
least one of those moneyed investors has

34
00:01:26,368 --> 00:01:31,109
fired back arguing that some local

35
00:01:28,828 --> 00:01:32,639
farmers have trust issues when I get

36
00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:34,799
into some heated discussions sometimes

37
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,228
with my rice friends they'll say things

38
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,790
like well you know you can't come and

39
00:01:37,228 --> 00:01:40,650
steal the market it's like well no we're

40
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,659
all the market we it's the world we're

41
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:44,250
all brothers and sisters and if you grow

42
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:45,780
so much herb in Jamaica that all of a

43
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:48,269
sudden your Jamaican friends can't smoke

44
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,799
at all say some over to Canada since so

45
00:01:48,269 --> 00:01:52,109
long to America or send some over to

46
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:53,939
Europe that's that happened for decades

47
00:01:52,109 --> 00:01:56,459
and so now that's what we want to happen

48
00:01:53,938 --> 00:01:59,459
again I wanted to happen legally which

49
00:01:56,459 --> 00:02:01,349
then takes us to banking local banks

50
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:03,629
have shied away from doing business with

51
00:02:01,349 --> 00:02:05,759
players in the ganja industry because

52
00:02:03,629 --> 00:02:08,189
they fear they will be seen as engaging

53
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:11,800
in money laundering and lose valuable

54
00:02:08,189 --> 00:02:13,990
business ties with the US banks but

55
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:16,120
the farmers are questioning why banks

56
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:18,010
refused to do business with them when

57
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,170
they are the ones collecting on behalf

58
00:02:18,009 --> 00:02:22,299
of the cannabis licensing authority if

59
00:02:20,169 --> 00:02:25,179
something that I can understand what it

60
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:27,730
is dear / - it is a very complicated

61
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:29,920
situation because there are computer

62
00:02:27,729 --> 00:02:33,009
makers that are involved in the

63
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:35,139
candidates case bank accounts and there

64
00:02:33,009 --> 00:02:36,669
are so many companies involved the legal

65
00:02:35,139 --> 00:02:39,159
cannabis space that do not have bank

66
00:02:36,669 --> 00:02:41,649
accounts it's a very sloppy situation

67
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:43,900
and we wanted to the result so forth

68
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:46,000
whatever happens in the United States of

69
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:48,150
America in fact what happened in Jamaica

70
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,270
and also make about the world and the

71
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:54,870
CDJ news the standards and regulation

72
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:54,870
division of the
