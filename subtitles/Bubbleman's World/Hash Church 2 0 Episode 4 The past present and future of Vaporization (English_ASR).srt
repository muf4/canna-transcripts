yes I'm looking forward to the dialogue

57
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:38,530
today boys I think actually you know

58
00:02:36,909 --> 00:02:40,449
between the two of you right now you

59
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:42,939
might be two of the people that take

60
00:02:40,449 --> 00:02:47,019
this [ __ ] the most serious when it comes

61
00:02:42,939 --> 00:02:50,139
to love vaporization and sort of the

62
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:52,630
ability to not lower your integrity to

63
00:02:50,139 --> 00:02:54,489
acquire the thing that might be easier

64
00:02:52,629 --> 00:02:57,579
rather than fight through those

65
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:59,620
obstacles with the high integrity anyone

66
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:01,540
with high integrity knows you just come

67
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:05,349
up with more obstacles when you can't

68
00:03:01,539 --> 00:03:07,329
lower your integrity to make it work you

69
00:03:05,349 --> 00:03:10,090
guys know what I mean yeah

70
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:12,850
well I hope I can explain this correctly

71
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:15,039
in order to actually get something of

72
00:03:12,849 --> 00:03:19,030
high integrity you have to go against

73
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:20,829
the wave right here is where it the low

74
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:21,759
integrity is if you're going up against

75
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:24,640
the waiver you're doing something

76
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:26,079
different you're doing something how do

77
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:28,269
I put this you're doing something that

78
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,330
is a lot different than what everybody

79
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:32,800
else is the one and I a few a lot

80
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:34,330
different than what it thought it was

81
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:38,410
doing you're actually being seen

82
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:40,360
hopefully people take a take notice of

83
00:03:38,409 --> 00:03:43,569
that but at the same time you were

84
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:45,730
getting drowned as well so yes look into

85
00:03:43,569 --> 00:03:48,430
it yeah it's there's a whole situation

86
00:03:45,729 --> 00:03:52,299
of well David Suzuki put it beautifully

87
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:53,530
when he told me about his show and he

88
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,209
was like you know when I got the nature

89
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:58,390
of things show I really thought that I

90
00:03:55,209 --> 00:04:00,789
was gonna be this gem on television and

91
00:03:58,389 --> 00:04:03,639
then I quickly realized when you when

92
00:04:00,789 --> 00:04:06,489
you get tossed into a cesspool even if

93
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:09,309
you are a diamond but you quickly take

94
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:13,360
on the appearance of what is in the

95
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:16,000
cesspool so I was like a really good

96
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,830
metaphor dude yeah because you tie

97
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,649
yourself next to the doggy go there not

98
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:22,990
to be a dog one day you know it's it's

99
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:25,620
it's basically the same thing you take

100
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:27,790
on the appearance or wherever you are at

101
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,290
just like a person having the same

102
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:31,870
accent if

103
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:34,330
they live in the south for a long time

104
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:37,120
or in Europe for a long time it's just

105
00:04:34,329 --> 00:04:38,649
just the same thing yeah absolutely

106
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,720
someone's laughing that I brought up

107
00:04:38,649 --> 00:04:42,519
David Suzuki hey man David Suzuki was

108
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,840
awesome in his time the nature of things

109
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:45,849
that show was wicked

110
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:48,009
I think he's jaded through I think that

111
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:51,070
it was not just taking on the appearance

112
00:04:48,009 --> 00:04:52,689
of the cesspool but hey welcome to sabo

113
00:04:51,069 --> 00:04:54,310

we got it we got a good little group

121
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,209
here I don't know how many more we're

122
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:24,310
gonna have I did invite my friend Kevin

123
00:05:22,209 --> 00:05:26,739
from steamteam Jamaica I thought it

124
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:29,050
would be kind of a fun thing to have the

125
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:32,019
almost you know not the original as

126
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:33,910
McCoy reminded me the other day of the

127
00:05:32,019 --> 00:05:39,279
Sith ian's which I'll probably start

128
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:41,169
envision and I'll go through a small

129
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:43,059
history of vaporization and this is just

130
00:05:41,168 --> 00:05:45,519
an article I found online that I figured

131
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:47,350
I would read to everyone once I read the

132
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:49,120
history of vaporization anyone in the

133
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:51,700
room that wants this sort of toss in

134
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,379
their history and where they fit in or

135
00:05:51,699 --> 00:05:54,909
if they feel that something's a little

136
00:05:53,379 --> 00:05:56,620
bit different it's not the word of God

137
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:59,110
this is just an article that I found

138
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:02,379
online that I thought had a nice kind of

139
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:03,910
little history that I fit into pretty

140
00:06:02,379 --> 00:06:07,750
well because I you know I was in

141
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:10,000
Amsterdam in 1994-95 when bill was there

142
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:12,879
with the with his vaporizer and I met

143
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,519
mark McCoy at a fairly early on in the

144
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:17,050
game and so I've been I've met volcano

145
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:18,939
people the year they released the

146
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:21,699
volcano at the can of business in

147
00:06:18,939 --> 00:06:25,689
Germany I met Jurgen and his daughter so

148
00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:28,449
I have a fairly my own version of the

149
00:06:25,689 --> 00:06:32,259
history of vaporization so why don't I

150
00:06:28,449 --> 00:06:34,089
go right to that I have it open here

151
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:36,879
I'll probably share it on the page as

152
00:06:34,089 --> 00:06:38,348
well so people can see what I'm what I'm

153
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:39,848
reading and this will be quick and then

154
00:06:38,348 --> 00:06:41,539
once we do this what we'll do is we'll

155
00:06:39,848 --> 00:06:43,729
go through and each of you can

156
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:46,160
introduce yourself and sort of talk

157
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:48,610
about you know your passions of cannabis

158
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,170
and how it led into vaporization and

159
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:52,970
here I'm gonna just keep your mic muted

160
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:55,220
Gary if you guys notice I'll probably

161
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:57,530
mute your mics when they're unmuted that

162
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:59,450
way if you go to talk again just

163
00:06:57,529 --> 00:07:01,429
remember you got to unmute your mic as

164
00:06:59,449 --> 00:07:05,479
often we get some sort of feedback noise

165
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:07,579
here alright so let me change the screen

166
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:12,620
saver to show everyone what this is

167
00:07:07,579 --> 00:07:15,829
going on here yeah application window

168
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:19,040
there we go the history of vaping so

169
00:07:15,829 --> 00:07:21,019
this is from herb and I believe it was

170
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:23,450
the gentleman herb who wrote it it was

171
00:07:21,019 --> 00:07:24,889
it's a couple years old now so the

172
00:07:23,449 --> 00:07:26,420
history of vaporization herbs for

173
00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:28,669
inhalation is a practice that can be

174
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:31,250
traced back far back and across many

175
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:33,410
different civilizations so the history

176
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:35,389
of vaporization herbs for insulation out

177
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:36,860
we got that what exactly is vaporizing

178
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:38,449
or vaping alright so if you've been

179
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:40,670
living under a rock and aren't sure with

180
00:07:38,449 --> 00:07:42,259
vaping is here some explanation the

181
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:44,210
basic techniques since the inception of

182
00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:46,000
vaping either old or the new age battery

183
00:07:44,209 --> 00:07:48,739
supported vaporizers is the same

184
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,600
vaporizing heats the ingredients to an

185
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:52,519
optimum heat to the optimal temperature

186
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,530
range from cannabis is between 180 and

187
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:56,719
210 Celsius for the perfect vape

188
00:07:54,529 --> 00:07:58,789
compared to joints bongs or a pipe that

189
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,190
burns the ingredients the blend is

190
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:02,810
whether they be oils wax or dry herbs

191
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:04,100
are heated to a level allowing the

192
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:06,889
release of the materials but allow the

193
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:08,270
temperature that would burn them as

194
00:08:06,889 --> 00:08:09,649
there is no combustion during the

195
00:08:08,269 --> 00:08:11,930
process of heating a vapor is released

196
00:08:09,649 --> 00:08:13,399
this is quite cool and non irritating to

197
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:15,769
the users throat yeah unless you hit

198
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:17,239
like 17 volcano bags in a row without

199
00:08:15,769 --> 00:08:22,399
drinking tea and then you quickly

200
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:26,449
realize how dry it really is 15 what do

201
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:28,339
we got here sorry the 5th century 5th

202
00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:30,279
century BC so this is the this is the

203
00:08:28,339 --> 00:08:32,689
one mark was talking about the other day

204
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:35,240
vaporizing to humans has been known to

205
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:38,440
date back in Egypt from the book the

206
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:41,690
history of Herodotus 1928 dial press

207
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:43,130
during the 5th century BC her Herodotus

208
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:44,780
who was often called the father of

209
00:08:43,129 --> 00:08:47,480
history recorded his accounts of the

210
00:08:44,779 --> 00:08:49,370
ancient practice enjoyed by Citians the

211
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,950
Citians takes some of this hemp seed and

212
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:53,389
throw it upon the red-hot stones

213
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:54,889
immediately at vaporizes and gives us

214
00:08:53,389 --> 00:08:57,048
such a vapor as no Bree she

215
00:08:54,889 --> 00:09:00,259
paper baths can exceed the Scythian

216
00:08:57,048 --> 00:09:01,879
delighted shout for joy the steady heat

217
00:09:00,259 --> 00:09:05,028
from the baking stones would produce a

218
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:07,459
pleasant smelling vapor so 1500 years

219
00:09:05,028 --> 00:09:09,678
ago Afghanistan technically speaking the

220
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:11,868
first real vaporizer was event invented

221
00:09:09,678 --> 00:09:15,798
by Iran sheikh of the moguls present-day

222
00:09:11,869 --> 00:09:18,259
afghanistan Safa Safavid dynasty knows

223
00:09:15,798 --> 00:09:21,438
to us as hookah or as water pipe

224
00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:25,068
narghile argh Allah kaylynn shisha about

225
00:09:21,438 --> 00:09:26,688
1400 years ago moguls Mughals then

226
00:09:25,068 --> 00:09:28,488
rulers of India introduced hookah to

227
00:09:26,688 --> 00:09:30,259
India which was then more used to a

228
00:09:28,489 --> 00:09:31,459
Chilam the controversy over the

229
00:09:30,259 --> 00:09:33,259
invention there is quite a big

230
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:35,659
controversy over the invention of the

231
00:09:33,259 --> 00:09:39,798
first vaporizer here's a patent from

232
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:41,269
1927 USA the first one who came up with

233
00:09:39,798 --> 00:09:43,909
the idea of the electronic cigarette is

234
00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:45,558
Joseph Robinson he did it in 1927 in

235
00:09:43,909 --> 00:09:47,749
which he felt filed a patent to the

236
00:09:45,558 --> 00:09:50,448
USPTO for the first mechanical butane

237
00:09:47,749 --> 00:09:52,159
ignition vaporizer Robinson's patent was

238
00:09:50,448 --> 00:09:54,378
approved and published by the USPTO

239
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:56,149
little to his credit that he deserves he

240
00:09:54,379 --> 00:09:59,028
still owns the patent of the first

241
00:09:56,149 --> 00:10:01,578
nicotine vaporizer and so that one's

242
00:09:59,028 --> 00:10:04,100
from 1960 was the dawn of the modern day

243
00:10:01,578 --> 00:10:05,958
inventor of e-cigarette Korean veteran

244
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:07,790
herbart a Gilbert the modern-day

245
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:09,318
vaporizers until this day are claimed to

246
00:10:07,789 --> 00:10:11,808
be built on the blueprint of mr.

247
00:10:09,318 --> 00:10:14,178
Gilbert's original design mr. Gilbert to

248
00:10:11,808 --> 00:10:16,958
this date works for the emperor east

249
00:10:14,178 --> 00:10:19,399
cigarettes who bought his technology

250
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:21,409
1992-1994 amsterdam father of cannabis

251
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:22,879
vaporizer eagle bill has a cannabis

252
00:10:21,409 --> 00:10:24,948
community called following known to

253
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:26,989
discover the popularizing of the

254
00:10:24,948 --> 00:10:28,578
cannabis vaporizer he turned his device

255
00:10:26,989 --> 00:10:30,709
safe and effective alternative to

256
00:10:28,578 --> 00:10:32,359
smoking for over a decade he was a

257
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:33,918
favorite exhibit at the sensi see banks

258
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,470
hash Museum in Amsterdam that's

259
00:10:33,918 --> 00:10:38,269
definitely where I met him as well as at

260
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:42,350
the PAC's party house and as well as

261
00:10:38,269 --> 00:10:43,999
that lucky mother's in both 94 95 the

00:10:43,999 --> 00:10:47,389
world and build in joint bill enjoyed

264
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:50,028
sharing his new technologies to any

265
00:10:47,389 --> 00:10:51,948
willing inhalers a resident of Amsterdam

266
00:10:50,028 --> 00:10:56,509
for 12 years this was soon before the

267
00:10:51,948 --> 00:10:58,278
1994 cannabis cup sensi seeds gave bill

268
00:10:56,509 --> 00:11:00,230
space and he blew away the crowd with

269
00:10:58,278 --> 00:11:02,418
his new technology truly if anyone was

270
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:04,459
at the early cannabis cups it was really

271
00:11:02,418 --> 00:11:06,198
really hard to miss Eagle bill the guy

272
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:08,979
was an incredible energy and an

273
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:11,389
incredible advocate for vaporization

274
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:12,680
it remained the most popular exhibit at

275
00:11:11,389 --> 00:11:14,179
the cannabis cup for 10 years earning

276
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:16,489
bill and since he seeds numerous

277
00:11:14,179 --> 00:11:18,319
first-place cups soon he set up shop on

278
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:19,909
a daily basis and the hash Museum and

279
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,920
used that platform to turn the world on

280
00:11:19,909 --> 00:11:24,379
to vaporization Eagle bill was

281
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:27,409
introduced to vaporizing in 1993 by a

282
00:11:24,379 --> 00:11:30,799
California grower who used the heat gun

283
00:11:27,409 --> 00:11:33,289
to vaporize aromatic blends just in case

284
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:35,839
you didn't know everything in the

285
00:11:33,289 --> 00:11:38,509
cannabis industry always started with a

286
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:41,120
California grower I'm just gonna say

287
00:11:38,509 --> 00:11:43,429
that now whether its water hash whether

288
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,769
it's like it's just everything came from

289
00:11:43,429 --> 00:11:47,479
a California you follow the history back

290
00:11:45,769 --> 00:11:49,429
it's always the unknown California

291
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,139
grower it's amazing that we made

292
00:11:49,429 --> 00:11:53,149
everything man we made everything what

293
00:11:51,139 --> 00:11:55,819
can I say I'm just I'm not gonna die

294
00:11:53,149 --> 00:11:57,590
deny it bro so in an effort to design a

295
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:59,200
more affordable means of vaporizing were

296
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:02,170
simultaneously raising public awareness

297
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:05,690
Eagle Bill invented the shake and vape

298
00:12:02,169 --> 00:12:07,579
based on sorry based on the very same

299
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:09,290
ancient Egyptian methods Eagle Bill's

300
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:11,240
glass pipe vaporizer that heat at the

301
00:12:09,289 --> 00:12:13,360
bottom of a glass bowl with instead

302
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:15,500
light lighting the cannabis itself

303
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,269
pioneered by a Native American the

304
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:19,490
shaken vape was nicknamed the peace pipe

305
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:20,840
of the future Eagles bill invention

306
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:23,029
would be the catalyst for rapid

307
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:24,889
technology and product developments in

308
00:12:23,029 --> 00:12:27,980
the vaporizer industry and a big

309
00:12:24,889 --> 00:12:32,419
inspiration bill passed away on 22nd of

310
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:33,440
May 2005 in Georgia USA in 1994 BC

311
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:35,659
vaporizer

312
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:38,210
Canada claims to have invented the first

313
00:12:35,659 --> 00:12:41,269
electrically charged vaporizer inspired

314
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:43,100
on Bill's Amato design BC vaporizer

315
00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:45,230
still is running in business today and

316
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:48,590
our inventors of solar power charger

317
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:50,690
charge vaporizer it was however Storz

318
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:52,850
and Bickel company in 2000 that invented

319
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:55,310
the new era of desktop vaporizers and

320
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:57,860
named it volcano just like its work

321
00:12:55,309 --> 00:12:59,389
around the history of vaporizers as

322
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:01,460
controversial as it sound still holds

323
00:12:59,389 --> 00:13:03,259
the timeline benchmark and technically

324
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:05,690
makes hookah the oldest vaporizer

325
00:13:03,259 --> 00:13:07,069
modern-day vaporizers credit no doubt

326
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:09,890
boasts to everyone involved in the

327
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:12,140
process but still credited to late bill

328
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:13,909
Amato Amato for his pioneering endeavor

329
00:13:12,139 --> 00:13:16,009
to the cannabis world so that was a

330
00:13:13,909 --> 00:13:18,230
little article written by herb I know

331
00:13:16,009 --> 00:13:20,240
that everyone's not present and that

332
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:21,889
really kind of stops in 2000 where it

333
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,749
really sort of picks up

334
00:13:21,889 --> 00:13:26,629
and all of these different companies

335
00:13:23,749 --> 00:13:28,428
started to come into play but kind of a

336
00:13:26,629 --> 00:13:30,019
neat little timeline if any of you guys

337
00:13:28,428 --> 00:13:32,509
have anything you want to fix on that

338
00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:34,909
timeline by all means add it I can

339
00:13:32,509 --> 00:13:38,209
imagine maybe mark McCoy has something

340
00:13:34,909 --> 00:13:40,068
to say I don't know I thought that was I

341
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:41,028
thought that was pretty well done I mean

342
00:13:40,068 --> 00:13:43,368
there was a number of different

343
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:46,428
iterations that came off the Eagle bill

344
00:13:43,369 --> 00:13:49,369
including myself very much so inspired

345
00:13:46,428 --> 00:13:52,428
by we Eagle was doing with the heat gun

346
00:13:49,369 --> 00:13:54,139
and kind of got got keyed in by Doug

347
00:13:52,428 --> 00:13:56,629
Minneola an old childhood friend of mine

348
00:13:54,139 --> 00:14:00,318
from Foster City that also ended up in

349
00:13:56,629 --> 00:14:02,829
Amsterdam and for me just coming from

350
00:14:00,318 --> 00:14:06,528
that one hit snapped through school of

351
00:14:02,828 --> 00:14:07,969
water-pipe smoking West Coast our you

352
00:14:06,528 --> 00:14:09,588
know if you over packed the bowl and you

353
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:12,259
couldn't app it through yourself and

354
00:14:09,589 --> 00:14:13,699
enjoy the fresh he will you you were

355
00:14:12,259 --> 00:14:15,589
punished by snapping through that a she

356
00:14:13,698 --> 00:14:18,229
so you packed a freshie for your bro and

357
00:14:15,589 --> 00:14:20,540
I just was looking to emulate that same

358
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:23,418
sort of ritual and philosophy with vapor

359
00:14:20,539 --> 00:14:25,899
when I took the heat guns and developed

360
00:14:23,418 --> 00:14:28,938
the the chamber bull concept

361
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:30,438
additionally just a big fan of the water

362
00:14:28,938 --> 00:14:32,688
pipe and the moisture conditioning

363
00:14:30,438 --> 00:14:34,428
component I think you know it's

364
00:14:32,688 --> 00:14:37,879
important to note that especially with

365
00:14:34,428 --> 00:14:40,730
cannabis the the heat and the dryness is

366
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:42,829
really what does the damage so hot and

367
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:45,949
dry vapor will still dry your throat out

368
00:14:42,828 --> 00:14:47,118
and irritate it and in fact I remember a

369
00:14:45,948 --> 00:14:49,248
long afternoon

370
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:51,918
pulling off that volcano with you in BC

371
00:14:49,249 --> 00:14:53,089
and waking up the next morning realizing

372
00:14:51,918 --> 00:14:54,639
man we should have ran that through the

373
00:14:53,089 --> 00:14:57,709
water pipe a little bit more than we did

374
00:14:54,639 --> 00:15:01,610
absolutely yeah that's that's going back

375
00:14:57,708 --> 00:15:02,808
for sure that must be 2001 or 2002 that

376
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:06,048
you're talking about right now we

377
00:15:02,808 --> 00:15:08,058
definitely have been at it for a while

378
00:15:06,048 --> 00:15:11,838
now mark was one of the first people to

379
00:15:08,058 --> 00:15:14,269
show me I guess simultaneously between

380
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:17,539
mark and Everett from the verdamper

381
00:15:14,269 --> 00:15:18,859
yeah whoo I also invited onto the show

382
00:15:17,538 --> 00:15:20,359
today I'm not sure if he got the message

383
00:15:18,859 --> 00:15:22,819
it went through his website and they

384
00:15:20,359 --> 00:15:24,709
were checking emails for 48 hours and I

385
00:15:22,818 --> 00:15:26,088
sent it a little bit late but he would

386
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:28,578
have been also great to have on the

387
00:15:26,089 --> 00:15:31,129
conversation the first time I ever hit

388
00:15:28,578 --> 00:15:34,159
the the verdamper I think it was at

389
00:15:31,129 --> 00:15:35,278
tsoumas place although maybe they also

390
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:37,259
had one at lucky

391
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:39,509
others when I with it with the with

392
00:15:37,259 --> 00:15:41,430
instead of the heat gun the strange

393
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:44,009
little sort of element that ever it made

394
00:15:41,429 --> 00:15:47,479
but yeah between mark and Everett back

395
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:50,669
then this is you know early 2000s I

396
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:52,319
guess what I had seen I had seen evil

397
00:15:50,669 --> 00:15:55,828
bill and Eagle was hitting out of this

398
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:58,259
huge giant so it was very hard to get

399
00:15:55,828 --> 00:16:00,179
the vapors super super concentrated and

400
00:15:58,259 --> 00:16:03,778
so from the connoisseur from the

401
00:16:00,179 --> 00:16:05,429
hardcore like chronic you know we were

402
00:16:03,778 --> 00:16:07,350
always looking like office volcanoes

403
00:16:05,429 --> 00:16:11,028
really cool if only we could make it

404
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:13,110
still a hundred bags we're in one bag

405
00:16:11,028 --> 00:16:15,139
that was always kind of like the

406
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:17,459
mentality like how can we get this

407
00:16:15,139 --> 00:16:18,688
perfect constant rated to the point

408
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:20,638
where I'm actually you know cuz

409
00:16:18,688 --> 00:16:23,909
obviously it was it was a beautiful

410
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:25,769
thing to be able to hit the the vapor

411
00:16:23,909 --> 00:16:27,808
and have it just the taste of it and the

412
00:16:25,769 --> 00:16:29,818
smoothness of it it and the subtle

413
00:16:27,808 --> 00:16:31,558
nuances of it it was very very different

414
00:16:29,818 --> 00:16:34,919
for anyone that ever went from straight

415
00:16:31,558 --> 00:16:37,068
burning joints 90s we were all just

416
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:39,028
burning joints and then all of a sudden

417
00:16:37,068 --> 00:16:41,039
someone was trying to show you oh you

418
00:16:39,028 --> 00:16:43,500
can vaporize it it was right up there

419
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:45,299
with putting water and ice and pot in a

420
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,589
bag and trying to tell people don't

421
00:16:45,299 --> 00:16:47,909
worry we're not gonna ruin this we're

422
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:51,209
just making hash right now they were

423
00:16:47,909 --> 00:16:54,058
like what like people throwing that herb

424
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:55,500
away like big big bags of the vaped

425
00:16:54,058 --> 00:16:58,318
herb it's like yeah that we're done with

426
00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:00,089
this and people were like no I can I

427
00:16:58,318 --> 00:17:02,250
could sell that it's like listen you

428
00:17:00,089 --> 00:17:03,540
don't want to sell that that is pretty

429
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:06,808
much the worst thing that you could

430
00:17:03,539 --> 00:17:10,099
possibly do what about vaporbrothers

431
00:17:06,808 --> 00:17:12,658
when did you guys come online Linus oh

432
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:14,428
you're muted and you definitely you're

433
00:17:12,659 --> 00:17:16,110
muted right now I muted your mic and you

434
00:17:14,429 --> 00:17:17,610
want to you want to be as close to your

435
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:20,788
mic as possible because when you turn

436
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:22,708
away a little bit the mic is cutting out

437
00:17:20,788 --> 00:17:24,240
slightly so as long as you're close your

438
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:28,110
voice will pick up real nice so yeah

439
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:33,599
when did vaporbrothers come along no

440
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:35,250
muted unmuted there's usually a little

441
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:39,759
button oh there you go you got it

442
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:41,529
oh you mute it again hit that one more

443
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:46,710
and wake up in the delay there you go

444
00:17:41,529 --> 00:17:50,529
okay good all right thanks well ed about

445
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:53,710
1998 winter of 98 we were really doing

446
00:17:50,529 --> 00:17:57,160
it can you hear me at the moment we can

447
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:59,350
hear you perfect my history was a lot of

448
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:02,679
going to college and a lot of trying to

449
00:17:59,349 --> 00:18:06,548
cut down a lot of trying to help friends

450
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:09,070
cut down on smoking and and so I was

451
00:18:06,548 --> 00:18:13,240
making very tiny pipes with very small

452
00:18:09,069 --> 00:18:17,439
holes and it was also trying to stretch

453
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:23,190
supply because in 90s la it wasn't you

454
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:25,590
know it's super easy to get good weed so

455
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:28,120
trying to smoke these tiny bowls

456
00:18:25,589 --> 00:18:32,259
suddenly I realized that I got way more

457
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:34,089
effect for way longer using less and I

458
00:18:32,259 --> 00:18:35,829
was doing that at the same time as my

459
00:18:34,089 --> 00:18:37,480
friend was investigating vaporizers

460
00:18:35,829 --> 00:18:39,490
because the BC vaporizer was out and

461
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:43,440
there were a little there handhelds one

462
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:46,509
was called Terra and we had just

463
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:48,160
discovered V rip tech maybe a year later

464
00:18:46,509 --> 00:18:51,519
we discovered and we actually talked to

465
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:55,240
mark we ran into him in Malibu once got

466
00:18:51,519 --> 00:19:01,660
a great lecture he has a lot of info to

467
00:18:55,240 --> 00:19:03,669
give but what we hated about the name

468
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:06,790
risers that we had was that vapor went

469
00:19:03,669 --> 00:19:08,110
into a glass bowl and it got stale there

470
00:19:06,789 --> 00:19:10,899
and when you went to take your hit the

471
00:19:08,109 --> 00:19:13,589
vapor just went around in circles and we

472
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:16,509
really wanted to make something that

473
00:19:13,589 --> 00:19:18,099
created the vapor and put it into you

474
00:19:16,509 --> 00:19:20,440
right away my friend was tinkering he

475
00:19:18,099 --> 00:19:24,369
took apart some parts they put him back

476
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:26,529
together with like a nugget floated in a

477
00:19:24,369 --> 00:19:29,439
piece of pipe that we connected to and

478
00:19:26,529 --> 00:19:31,139
heating iron and he got a hit and I

479
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,730
recognized because I was in physics

480
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:35,980
classes and stuff at the time that he

481
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:38,440
was drawing hot air out of a heating

482
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:40,298
element and through the herb and when we

483
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:43,210
realized very quickly that the best way

484
00:19:40,298 --> 00:19:45,160
to vaporize was pure convection

485
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:48,519
basically heat air and pass it through

486
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:52,179
herb don't touch the herb to hot metal

487
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:53,230
or anything and basically that's what

488
00:19:52,179 --> 00:19:55,240
Mark McCoy was doing

489
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:58,298
on a large scale big diameter big

490
00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:00,099
airflow and what this e terre vaporizer

491
00:19:58,298 --> 00:20:01,990
little handheld vaporizer was doing but

492
00:20:00,099 --> 00:20:03,668
it would burn your lips and stuff we

493
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:05,950
came up with basically here's the

494
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:09,370
diameter that we ended up with which is

495
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:12,159
about 11 millimeters on the inside and

496
00:20:09,369 --> 00:20:15,518
that was the perfect bowl for me little

497
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:18,159
big little SMO for us but it ended up

498
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:21,190
being like our standard and what we

499
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:25,028
think we came up with was the good sharp

500
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:28,630
strong moist hit from the smallest

501
00:20:25,028 --> 00:20:31,148
amount of herbs but still big enough for

502
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:33,580
a few people and this thing would get

503
00:20:31,148 --> 00:20:35,678
people too high which basically once my

504
00:20:33,579 --> 00:20:37,509
co inventor called me and said that he

505
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:39,820
was in the fetal position I was like wow

506
00:20:37,509 --> 00:20:42,429
we're on to something we need to do

507
00:20:39,819 --> 00:20:44,589
something with this it that's important

508
00:20:42,429 --> 00:20:47,080
because the world was smoking and we

509
00:20:44,589 --> 00:20:48,939
needed to impress smokers and just like

510
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:50,888
you know trying to get onto vegetarian

511
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:52,808
food or something when you try it and

512
00:20:50,888 --> 00:20:55,028
you really just want a burger afterwards

513
00:20:52,808 --> 00:20:58,690
because it maybe ate something that was

514
00:20:55,028 --> 00:21:00,788
not heavy enough once you you can get

515
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:06,519
this heavy enough and get this strong

516
00:21:00,788 --> 00:21:08,169
sharp thick vapor you think you can go

517
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:10,599
back to smoking and you can't because

518
00:21:08,169 --> 00:21:14,409
you're affected and of course the effect

519
00:21:10,599 --> 00:21:16,388
was longer it was great because like if

520
00:21:14,409 --> 00:21:19,269
it wears off you can vaporize more and

521
00:21:16,388 --> 00:21:21,219
you get you get right back up again

522
00:21:19,269 --> 00:21:22,960
whereas smoking is more like coffee to

523
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:24,700
me like it goes way high and then

524
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:28,230
crashes and you smoke more you get more

525
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:31,179
more sober you know what's up at that

526
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:32,980
but yeah that was our start I mean I can

527
00:21:31,179 --> 00:21:37,230
talk forever about this but basically

528
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:40,750
where we think we came in was well quiet

529
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:42,880
small could be in your house

530
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:45,460
this one's beautifully painted but it

531
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:48,010
the main model will I'll bring one out

532
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:50,319
little later is a wooden box this is

533
00:21:48,009 --> 00:21:52,679
painted by my girlfriend Lindsey's heart

534
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:55,058
work she's doing a project with them

535
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:57,788
with visionary artists on her vaporizer

536
00:21:55,058 --> 00:22:02,288
but basically just connecting and

537
00:21:57,788 --> 00:22:04,119
drawing a big breath of fresh air but

538
00:22:02,288 --> 00:22:06,519
yeah I could go into it forever because

539
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:06,758
we we got really Micro with you know

540
00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:08,739
what

541
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:11,078
we were doing what we thought we had to

542
00:22:08,739 --> 00:22:12,999
do was popularize the notion of

543
00:22:11,078 --> 00:22:15,548
vaporizing though because it was really

544
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:17,618
unheard of and before volcano came out

545
00:22:15,548 --> 00:22:19,690
and went on 60 minutes it was totally

546
00:22:17,618 --> 00:22:22,148
uncool and we were trying to convince

547
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:24,729
people once you get three hits into them

548
00:22:22,148 --> 00:22:27,368
their proselytize they proselytize

549
00:22:24,729 --> 00:22:30,639
others they're there they're in the

550
00:22:27,368 --> 00:22:32,798
religion almost so we spread kind of

551
00:22:30,638 --> 00:22:34,358
exponentially in it eventually we tried

552
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:36,338
to just become the most common vaporizer

553
00:22:34,358 --> 00:22:38,798
in the world through our knock-offs

554
00:22:36,338 --> 00:22:40,989
we got knocked off immediately and over

555
00:22:38,798 --> 00:22:45,668
again somewhere improvements most were

556
00:22:40,989 --> 00:22:47,709
we're just cheapens this angled wooden

557
00:22:45,669 --> 00:22:49,288
box that I drew one night on an

558
00:22:47,709 --> 00:22:51,969
all-nighter

559
00:22:49,288 --> 00:23:01,798
I'd like this your knockoffs have no go

560
00:22:51,969 --> 00:23:05,109
so you know that right Hydra - all right

561
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:07,328
great analogy - with the vegetarian and

562
00:23:05,108 --> 00:23:10,418
just the few things that you said there

563
00:23:07,328 --> 00:23:12,190
I also have to mention the BC vaporizer

564
00:23:10,419 --> 00:23:13,829
because I'm sure nobody wants to throw

565
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:16,899
that thing under the bus but I'll do it

566
00:23:13,828 --> 00:23:19,448
it was pretty much the worst vaporizer

567
00:23:16,898 --> 00:23:22,928
on the planet yet it was like the one

568
00:23:19,449 --> 00:23:25,589
that's sold so many back in the day like

569
00:23:22,929 --> 00:23:28,359
I know the guy who invented it he sold

570
00:23:25,588 --> 00:23:30,398
thousands of them thousands upon

571
00:23:28,358 --> 00:23:32,858
thousands upon thousands of those

572
00:23:30,398 --> 00:23:34,808
vaporizers were sold and they were the

573
00:23:32,858 --> 00:23:36,398
ones with the little pan and the dome

574
00:23:34,808 --> 00:23:39,158
and you know we got to give them their

575
00:23:36,398 --> 00:23:41,258
place because they almost popularized

576
00:23:39,159 --> 00:23:45,249
the notion of vaporizing

577
00:23:41,259 --> 00:23:47,558
without really vaporizing and I'll give

578
00:23:45,249 --> 00:23:50,139
them another props because it was Shona

579
00:23:47,558 --> 00:23:52,328
Banda who was basically wasting away

580
00:23:50,138 --> 00:23:54,638
from Crohn's disease getting arrested in

581
00:23:52,328 --> 00:23:56,469
the Midwest having her threats of her

582
00:23:54,638 --> 00:23:58,868
child taken and when she came on hash

583
00:23:56,469 --> 00:24:00,999
Church and she talked about the oil that

584
00:23:58,868 --> 00:24:03,878
she was using to help save her life from

585
00:24:00,999 --> 00:24:05,709
Crohn's she wasn't doing mzt she wasn't

586
00:24:03,878 --> 00:24:07,988
doing coconut oil she wasn't doing Rick

587
00:24:05,709 --> 00:24:10,209
Simpsons she wasn't doing any of these

588
00:24:07,989 --> 00:24:13,028
oils or bubble hashes or anything what

589
00:24:10,209 --> 00:24:15,719
she was doing was she was collecting the

590
00:24:13,028 --> 00:24:20,140
condensed cannabinoids and terpenoids

591
00:24:15,719 --> 00:24:22,180
from inside one of those dome vaporizers

592
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:24,970
and she was collecting that oil and that

593
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:27,700
oil damn near saved her life if not did

594
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:29,650
save her life so once again it's always

595
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:31,299
easy to judge things it's always to be

596
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:33,220
easy to be like oh yeah that thing's a

597
00:24:31,299 --> 00:24:34,930
piece of [ __ ] there's no place for well

598
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:36,970
you know what I'll say this there is a

599
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:39,160
place for it it was a very important

600
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:41,259
thing for people to see close full-page

601
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:44,140
ads in cannabis culture and High Times

602
00:24:41,259 --> 00:24:45,819
magazines back in the day and and and

603
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:47,830
just start putting their money into

604
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:49,329
vaporizers now some could say it was a

605
00:24:47,829 --> 00:24:51,279
bit of a step back when they ended up

606
00:24:49,329 --> 00:24:53,230
getting it and all it did was really

607
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:55,210
brown your herb and kind of not really

608
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:56,950
give you many many rips and I'll

609
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:59,920
definitely say it was probably in the

610
00:24:56,950 --> 00:25:03,039
late 90s that I started hearing a lot

611
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:04,390
about vaporbrothers and when I looked at

612
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:07,569
it I was like okay this is a much better

613
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:09,520
design like so and I'm sure that that BC

614
00:25:07,569 --> 00:25:12,730
vaporizer helped you guys come up with

615
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:15,519
what not to do well if I could admit our

616
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:17,680
first model number one was a BC

617
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:19,930
vaporizer that had been taken apart the

618
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:21,910
heating element exposed and my co

619
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:23,500
inventor basically stuck a piece of

620
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:25,900
pipes or a direct straight on it and

621
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:27,670
sucked air through it he was wanting to

622
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:30,009
draw the heat out of it more and I was

623
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:33,610
recognizing the the convection going on

624
00:25:30,009 --> 00:25:36,339
and they launched us so did the e terror

625
00:25:33,609 --> 00:25:39,779
that's the other BC vaporizer a neat era

626
00:25:36,339 --> 00:25:41,949
both both got us into it

627
00:25:39,779 --> 00:25:44,349
interesting well we all have to stand on

628
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:45,940
the shoulders of giants all the people

629
00:25:44,349 --> 00:25:48,129
that come before us all the people that

630
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:49,990
come after us you know we get stuck in

631
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:51,460
our egos sometimes and we think that

632
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:53,500
we're this individual and that were

633
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:55,509
worthy innovators we're doing this we're

634
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:56,920
doing that but there's no innovating I

635
00:25:55,509 --> 00:25:59,650
mean ball bags would have never existed

636
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:01,779
without isolator bags it was first

637
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:03,550
seeing the isolator bags that gave me

638
00:26:01,779 --> 00:26:06,069
the idea to add screens and to actually

639
00:26:03,549 --> 00:26:07,809
innovate and it's not copying when you

640
00:26:06,069 --> 00:26:09,549
make a product better and you innovate

641
00:26:07,809 --> 00:26:11,710
and you stand on the shoulders of said

642
00:26:09,549 --> 00:26:14,019
giant to move things over to that next

643
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:15,670
level that's kind of how we've gotten to

644
00:26:14,019 --> 00:26:18,129
where we are today with so many

645
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:21,730
different incredible vaporizers on the

646
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:24,400
market last week go ahead I was going to

647
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:27,029
say you it is not copying but I

648
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,930
understand about that but you give

649
00:26:27,029 --> 00:26:31,180
acknowledgment to where your product

650
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:32,400
came from you give the abolishment to

651
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:34,470
where you got this

652
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,910
raishin for your product a lot of these

653
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:38,190
companies will just take right now

654
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:40,110
you're designing just Rebecca or we just

655
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:41,789
we we were the ones who do the first

656
00:26:40,109 --> 00:26:43,559
where they don't even give

657
00:26:41,789 --> 00:26:46,460
acknowledgement to the companies before

658
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:49,470
them that actually pioneered the way

659
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:51,269
well you're a difference today you're

660
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:53,100
you're in a difficult situation because

661
00:26:51,269 --> 00:26:55,259
you're in the pen market and you're like

662
00:26:53,099 --> 00:26:58,139
the only person in the pen market with

663
00:26:55,259 --> 00:27:00,750
high integrity so you're like you have

664
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:03,240
you are in the biggest cesspool of them

665
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:05,430
all I know that when you first went to

666
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:07,620
China to try and develop your designs

667
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:09,750
and you threw all your terrible designs

668
00:27:07,619 --> 00:27:11,909
into the garbage that we're that we're

669
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:15,150
not going to pass Gary's integrity test

670
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:16,860
what happened to those those those plans

671
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:19,320
that got thrown into the garbage

672
00:27:16,859 --> 00:27:22,979
well you gotta understand China is a

673
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:25,559
communist nation the IP belongs to

674
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:27,269
everybody even though that the designs

675
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:28,919
are there they're not being used but

676
00:27:27,269 --> 00:27:31,289
they are being shared so somebody from

677
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:34,650
an engineer from another company has

678
00:27:31,289 --> 00:27:37,619
access to the designs that I had that

679
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:42,470
was being given to our previous

680
00:27:37,619 --> 00:27:42,469
manufacturers this is the whole story is

681
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:47,640
almost ninety 90 to 95 percent of the

682
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:50,639
designs are out there are basically

683
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:56,550
based on what I have done since the year

684
00:27:50,640 --> 00:28:01,170
2008 I'll have to I'll tell you the

685
00:27:56,549 --> 00:28:04,829
story in 2012 I was at age a a show and

686
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:08,400
my original oil tank that we had coming

687
00:28:04,829 --> 00:28:11,639
out we had that came out in 2011 and I

688
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:14,310
was at a show and I'm looking at this

689
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:18,180
guy that this company sell the tank and

690
00:28:14,309 --> 00:28:19,980
knockoff of our tank and he's tall and I

691
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:21,570
approached him in the I asked him a

692
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:23,069
what's good about this tank and what's

693
00:28:21,569 --> 00:28:25,129
the difference between this and that and

694
00:28:23,069 --> 00:28:27,960
he's telling me he's giving me his

695
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:29,490
ourselves a pitch and he's the saying

696
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:31,200
what we did this we do that

697
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:33,509
I go you understand that I'm the guy who

698
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,160
designed this right you're telling me

699
00:28:33,509 --> 00:28:37,740
that it's doing things that it's never

700
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:41,670
intended to do usually and he looked at

701
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:43,890
me like oh [ __ ] you know I'm just I was

702
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:46,230
just trying to climb a hill calm the guy

703
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:48,480
who actually designed the tank

704
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:50,250
and and I'm looking at them like you

705
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:53,130
guys even understand what you guys are

706
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:56,490
doing and uh you know you you're taking

707
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:58,710
a design that's not even yours and just

708
00:28:56,490 --> 00:29:00,509
marketing it as yours and you're like oh

709
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:02,190
boo we changed the mouthpiece on it well

710
00:29:00,509 --> 00:29:03,480
that doesn't make it a different design

711
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:07,200
just because you change the mouthpiece

712
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:08,579
on it you know so it's companies like

713
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,860
that that are out there right now that

714
00:29:08,579 --> 00:29:14,099
are just causing a lot of problems for

715
00:29:10,859 --> 00:29:16,949
companies that are actually in it for

716
00:29:14,099 --> 00:29:19,079
the purposes that were in it for that

717
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:22,830
client has said he was there for you

718
00:29:19,079 --> 00:29:26,369
know just to bring a better device to

719
00:29:22,829 --> 00:29:29,399
the market to allow people to not you

720
00:29:26,369 --> 00:29:32,839
know not to allow people to get away

721
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:36,210
from combustion I got in it because I a

722
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:39,539
lot of people that I've met couldn't

723
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:41,340
smoke and and eating was a option for

724
00:29:39,539 --> 00:29:42,529
them so we have to deliver the fastest

725
00:29:41,339 --> 00:29:46,439
way possible

726
00:29:42,529 --> 00:29:48,808
for THC and CBD to hit there they hit

727
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:51,570
their system and the only way to do that

728
00:29:48,808 --> 00:29:58,798
is the pulmonary you know get it through

729
00:29:51,569 --> 00:30:00,418
the lungs and how do I put this it it's

730
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:03,329
it's a little bit difficult see in the

731
00:30:00,419 --> 00:30:07,580
world you know the way it revolves and

732
00:30:03,329 --> 00:30:09,869
how how people are attracted to

733
00:30:07,579 --> 00:30:12,029
marketing [ __ ] marketing that's all

734
00:30:09,869 --> 00:30:14,789
I can say right now yeah not only

735
00:30:12,029 --> 00:30:16,079
[ __ ] marketing but like pricing you

736
00:30:14,789 --> 00:30:17,909
know you could just copy someone's

737
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:19,829
product make it a fraction of the price

738
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:21,808
because it's a fraction of the product

739
00:30:19,829 --> 00:30:23,730
it's a piece of [ __ ] and people are

740
00:30:21,808 --> 00:30:26,039
gravitate towards that I can't tell you

741
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:28,769
how many people have bought really bad

742
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:31,619
knockoff bags and then contacting him in

743
00:30:28,769 --> 00:30:34,259
like these bags fell apart material fell

744
00:30:31,619 --> 00:30:35,909
into my hash the screens blew out and

745
00:30:34,259 --> 00:30:37,710
I'm like oh I'm sorry to hear that it's

746
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:39,660
like yeah yours we're so expensive and I

747
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:40,679
didn't really want to you know jump into

748
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:42,840
it it's like yeah but mine are

749
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:44,548
warrantied for life and I like I'll take

750
00:30:42,839 --> 00:30:45,720
care of you with customer service like

751
00:30:44,548 --> 00:30:47,910
that's what you have to look at

752
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:49,019
generally for a quality product that

753
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:50,308
might be a little bit more expensive

754
00:30:49,019 --> 00:30:52,200
you're going to get really good customer

755
00:30:50,308 --> 00:30:54,869
service you're going to get incredible

756
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:56,819
warranty and you're not going to be

757
00:30:54,869 --> 00:30:58,529
bummed out if something happens it's on

758
00:30:56,819 --> 00:30:58,879
a fluke because the company's going to

759
00:30:58,529 --> 00:31:01,700
take

760
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:03,050
you you buy a piece of [ __ ] you won't

761
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:05,150
even be able to get back in touch with

762
00:31:03,049 --> 00:31:06,200
that company unless you push like one

763
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:08,120
for sales

764
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:10,580
if you push two for customer service it

765
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:13,189
just rings and rings and rings and rings

766
00:31:10,579 --> 00:31:14,359
and rings go you got to pretend you're

767
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:20,450
buying more [ __ ] from those

768
00:31:14,359 --> 00:31:23,269
[ __ ] understand person - go

769
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:25,519
ahead I said it's usually the same

770
00:31:23,269 --> 00:31:27,740
person - that picks up the phone for

771
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:33,230
support and sales yeah yeah yeah that's

772
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:35,509
always a good sign you gotta understand

773
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:38,000
it's not only it's not only that the

774
00:31:35,509 --> 00:31:40,579
aspect of it is the original company

775
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,890
take for instance like let's say company

776
00:31:40,579 --> 00:31:44,599
who came up with a design they have to

777
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:46,430
spend research and they have to spend

778
00:31:44,599 --> 00:31:48,019
money on research and development it's

779
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:49,789
in the thousands they have to spend

780
00:31:48,019 --> 00:31:52,759
money on molds and there and all of that

781
00:31:49,789 --> 00:31:56,000
now we can't produce it in the United

782
00:31:52,759 --> 00:31:59,539
States because if because of cost it

783
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,069
just the cost are outrageous when you

784
00:31:59,539 --> 00:32:03,859
actually produce something in the United

785
00:32:01,069 --> 00:32:06,099
States and first to protect our IP even

786
00:32:03,859 --> 00:32:09,349
if you produce it in the United States

787
00:32:06,099 --> 00:32:12,709
China can still copy it and as Linus

788
00:32:09,349 --> 00:32:14,929
knows he's you know the taking companies

789
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:18,259
to Cork taking yeah other companies to

790
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:20,470
court for IP infringement is a lot of

791
00:32:18,259 --> 00:32:23,779
work and a lot of money being spent on

792
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:26,900
ridiculous lawsuits now if you produce

793
00:32:23,779 --> 00:32:30,139
it in China okay so now China has your

794
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:32,060
IP they can literally copy it and sell

795
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:36,140
it to somebody else does that make sense

796
00:32:32,059 --> 00:32:37,579
so the original company that has spent

797
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:40,340
the money on research and development

798
00:32:37,579 --> 00:32:42,139
gets shafted because now their product

799
00:32:40,339 --> 00:32:44,869
is gonna has to be priced at let's say

800
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:47,180
$100 while the knockoff comes in doesn't

801
00:32:44,869 --> 00:32:49,669
have the overhead now they can price the

802
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:53,090
same product for 50 bucks and still you

803
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:54,710
know to walk away with profit yeah it's

804
00:32:53,089 --> 00:32:56,149
for sure a problem it's just like

805
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:58,100
anything right that you have the

806
00:32:56,150 --> 00:33:01,370
innovators you have the passionately

807
00:32:58,099 --> 00:33:03,439
fueled innovators who without them the

808
00:33:01,369 --> 00:33:05,089
it would just never the products would

809
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,590
never come to be because these are the

810
00:33:05,089 --> 00:33:09,139
people who are spending their time and

811
00:33:06,589 --> 00:33:10,699
their energy focusing on how can I make

812
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:12,830
this concept work

813
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:15,048
how can we make you know and so it's not

814
00:33:12,829 --> 00:33:16,999
really about like I just want to make

815
00:33:15,048 --> 00:33:19,220
millions of dollars it's not about that

816
00:33:16,999 --> 00:33:20,839
at all and you can kind of tell in the

817
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:22,519
product and in the integrity of the

818
00:33:20,839 --> 00:33:24,408
person who's releasing that product they

819
00:33:22,519 --> 00:33:27,019
really love their product it's important

820
00:33:24,409 --> 00:33:29,809
to them but once again it's business

821
00:33:27,019 --> 00:33:31,669
right it's a cesspool of business so you

822
00:33:29,808 --> 00:33:34,038
slowly take on the appearance that

823
00:33:31,669 --> 00:33:36,590
metaphor of jumping into the pool full

824
00:33:34,038 --> 00:33:39,378
of [ __ ] and trying to not look like [ __ ]

825
00:33:36,589 --> 00:33:41,928
at the end of the day is a tough gig

826
00:33:39,378 --> 00:33:43,668
there's one other facet to that guys you

827
00:33:41,929 --> 00:33:45,739
know you have the people that have

828
00:33:43,669 --> 00:33:47,960
integrity and are more business oriented

829
00:33:45,739 --> 00:33:50,569
but they have the intent they have the

830
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:53,659
integrity license from the innovators

831
00:33:50,569 --> 00:33:56,210
license from that impassioned group or

832
00:33:53,659 --> 00:33:57,769
individual that sought the intellectual

833
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:59,840
property did what they're supposed to do

834
00:33:57,769 --> 00:34:01,519
to get their protections and then they

835
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:04,819
put their product out there paying a

836
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:07,249
licensing fee back to a royalty back to

837
00:34:04,819 --> 00:34:09,588
that innovator and then their product

838
00:34:07,249 --> 00:34:11,030
has to be a couple bucks more and then

839
00:34:09,588 --> 00:34:13,159
they get beat up because they're

840
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:15,669
Proctor's a couple bucks more and the

841
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:19,068
aah coughs benefited that same

842
00:34:15,668 --> 00:34:21,230
impassioned innovators technology and

843
00:34:19,068 --> 00:34:23,808
they're not paying the royalty so I

844
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:25,909
think it's important for just consumers

845
00:34:23,809 --> 00:34:27,879
out there to recognize that there is

846
00:34:25,909 --> 00:34:30,079
some value in spending a few bucks extra

847
00:34:27,878 --> 00:34:32,210
supporting the company that actually is

848
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:33,589
loyalty to the innovators to keep

849
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:36,289
supporting the innovators to keep

850
00:34:33,588 --> 00:34:39,168
innovating I am one of the very few

851
00:34:36,289 --> 00:34:41,568
people who do that very thing I paid I

852
00:34:39,168 --> 00:34:45,289
have paid royalty fees for bubble bags

853
00:34:41,568 --> 00:34:48,679
from 1999 all the way up into the future

854
00:34:45,289 --> 00:34:51,730
so I've leased Rinehart delp's patent

855
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:55,628
for water extraction wrist and piece I'm

856
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:58,760
I'm like one of I'm like one of four

857
00:34:55,628 --> 00:35:03,710
people who have did you just say rest in

858
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:07,579
peace he passed away

859
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:10,460
that was my understanding ya know too

860
00:35:07,579 --> 00:35:12,519
long ago bro jeez I was that's insane I

861
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:14,599
wondered why I hadn't heard from

862
00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:16,610
supporting the family though man so

863
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:18,289
you're doing the right thing no no

864
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:20,240
the right thing and I was very happy to

865
00:35:18,289 --> 00:35:23,150
do it and there was a very few handfuls

866
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:26,509
of us that pay loads bags did it triple

867
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:29,360
extractor from out east and Canada did

868
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:31,970
it those are the only companies that

869
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:33,740
paid him royalties on clearly when you

870
00:35:31,969 --> 00:35:35,689
follow that history I'm not going to get

871
00:35:33,739 --> 00:35:37,099
into the whole thing right right now but

872
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:38,300
it because it but it does kind of play

873
00:35:37,099 --> 00:35:39,589
into the conversation that were

874
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:42,019
happening that we're having right now

875
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:43,850
about you know you're just the

876
00:35:42,019 --> 00:35:46,789
innovators just want to innovate we just

877
00:35:43,849 --> 00:35:49,099
want to like just create and and and do

878
00:35:46,789 --> 00:35:50,480
new things with what the product that we

879
00:35:49,099 --> 00:35:54,529
have is we want to make it better in

880
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:56,599
some way which often the problem with

881
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:58,220
that is a lot of people think well what

882
00:35:56,599 --> 00:36:02,000
would really be better is if it was

883
00:35:58,219 --> 00:36:04,969
cheaper and that's um that's not really

884
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:07,699
better well you don't understand what

885
00:36:04,969 --> 00:36:11,449
one mark was talking about paying

886
00:36:07,699 --> 00:36:13,879
royalties and all and all that when we

887
00:36:11,449 --> 00:36:17,000
came out with the very first cotton this

888
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:19,280
oil cartridge we were approached by a

889
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:22,429
massive distributor who was in the

890
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:25,070
vaporizer industry and literally told me

891
00:36:22,429 --> 00:36:28,819
if I cannot distribute this product I'm

892
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:31,430
gonna knock it off either you either

893
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:37,370
sell it only to me or I'm gonna knock it

894
00:36:31,429 --> 00:36:39,859
off it was literally like okay you you

895
00:36:37,369 --> 00:36:41,150
you know and I and I told them go how

896
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:43,250
are you gonna knock off my patent he

897
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:44,630
goes it's very easy to circumvent a

898
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:47,000
patent I just have to change something

899
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:49,280
on it you know it doesn't have to be big

900
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:52,940
I just have to change something and and

901
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:54,380
I will bury you in lawyer fees and after

902
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:56,450
that I said you know what I'm not even

903
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:58,400
going after patents anymore because to

904
00:36:56,449 --> 00:37:01,339
even patent something in the cannabis

905
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:04,700
industries it was nearly impossible in

906
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:07,190
2011 2012 and to this day it's still

907
00:37:04,699 --> 00:37:07,819
very very hard to patent something in

908
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:10,039
the industry

909
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:12,980
paraphernalia itself cannot be patented

910
00:37:10,039 --> 00:37:14,389
a few of them have patents but you got

911
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:18,260
to look at it this way even when they do

912
00:37:14,389 --> 00:37:19,789
have patents they're still knockoffs it

913
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:23,420
just doesn't save anything

914
00:37:19,789 --> 00:37:25,789
so royalties it takes it takes the

915
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:27,099
individual who wants to license it to

916
00:37:25,789 --> 00:37:28,900
say you know what I'm the

917
00:37:27,099 --> 00:37:31,479
pay royalties for this guy even if he

918
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:34,059
doesn't have patent but but he developed

919
00:37:31,478 --> 00:37:36,518
the technology you know it takes the

920
00:37:34,059 --> 00:37:40,119
individual person takes but in this

921
00:37:36,518 --> 00:37:42,399
industry in 99.99% of the people are not

922
00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:45,700
like that they will literally use you in

923
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:47,470
Tashia they'll claim over here you know

924
00:37:45,699 --> 00:37:49,748
we got to work together [ __ ] they

925
00:37:47,469 --> 00:37:51,189
turn on the study in the back which is

926
00:37:49,748 --> 00:37:52,748
crazy because what they're really saying

927
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:54,130
is can you put your hands together and

928
00:37:52,748 --> 00:37:56,048
give me a little boost and you're like

929
00:37:54,130 --> 00:38:06,009
sure and as you bend down they step on

930
00:37:56,048 --> 00:38:08,018
the back here in agony well so why don't

931
00:38:06,009 --> 00:38:10,088
we go through I mean we have in a way

932
00:38:08,018 --> 00:38:12,399
already but why don't we go through our

933
00:38:10,088 --> 00:38:14,798
histories of how we've gotten you know

934
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:17,259
each of you guys how you really got into

935
00:38:14,798 --> 00:38:19,389
the passion of cannabis and then how

936
00:38:17,259 --> 00:38:20,588
that led you however many years later

937
00:38:19,389 --> 00:38:24,368
that's what I really want is the

938
00:38:20,588 --> 00:38:28,900
timeline back to vaporization or to

939
00:38:24,369 --> 00:38:32,259
start Gary sure in the early 2000s I

940
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:33,818
started working in the laboratory it was

941
00:38:32,259 --> 00:38:36,400
a medical laboratory what we didn't love

942
00:38:33,818 --> 00:38:39,788
tests and all that I worked my way up

943
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:43,809
until I ended up owning the laboratory

944
00:38:39,789 --> 00:38:46,150
itself where I've met a lot of people

945
00:38:43,809 --> 00:38:48,130
that would come in we would do we would

946
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:52,719
draw their blood for the testing and all

947
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:54,818
that and meeting a lot of these patients

948
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:57,729
you know you helped me understand

949
00:38:54,818 --> 00:39:01,630
because at that time I was not for

950
00:38:57,728 --> 00:39:03,338
cannabis as a medicine I was totally

951
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:06,400
against it actually the to me was just

952
00:39:03,338 --> 00:39:08,828
another drug because I've brought I was

953
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:12,309
brought up in a conservative family so

954
00:39:08,829 --> 00:39:17,769
meeting these general trainee what

955
00:39:12,309 --> 00:39:19,450
happened I said Joe straight II okay you

956
00:39:17,768 --> 00:39:20,978
were at Joe sweetie that's okay you were

957
00:39:19,449 --> 00:39:27,518
a Joe strating and then you started to

958
00:39:20,978 --> 00:39:29,739
learn yeah so in mid-2000 when I started

959
00:39:27,518 --> 00:39:31,238
you know talking to these people they

960
00:39:29,739 --> 00:39:32,969
helped me understand that they actually

961
00:39:31,239 --> 00:39:35,679
started helping me learn how to grow

962
00:39:32,969 --> 00:39:36,110
because we became friends with a lot of

963
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:40,519
them

964
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:43,610
and in 2007 they approached me about

965
00:39:40,519 --> 00:39:44,929
opening up a dispensary 2008 2008 is

966
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:46,700
when we were able to open up the

967
00:39:44,929 --> 00:39:51,619
dispensary when we were opening up the

968
00:39:46,699 --> 00:39:53,949
dispensary I was if I saw one of the

969
00:39:51,619 --> 00:39:57,199
people using an electronic cigarette and

970
00:39:53,949 --> 00:39:58,929
when I saw it I'm like how cool it would

971
00:39:57,199 --> 00:40:01,429
it be if we can put a teacher in there

972
00:39:58,929 --> 00:40:02,980
you know the the only app the only thing

973
00:40:01,429 --> 00:40:05,389
at the time was literally glycerin

974
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:08,240
cannabis infused glycerin and our like

975
00:40:05,389 --> 00:40:09,799
how cool would it be and the gentleman

976
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:11,839
that was smoking it was a very good

977
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:13,370
friend of mine and he said well I tried

978
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:14,750
it just doesn't work because you take

979
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:16,309
the cartridge apart everything falls

980
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:19,550
apart and just can't put it in there and

981
00:40:16,309 --> 00:40:21,110
if I can it doesn't absorb too much

982
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:24,740
because there's cotton in there and all

983
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:29,750
of that we set out on a journey and in

984
00:40:24,739 --> 00:40:32,959
the 2009-2010 era we met a gentleman we

985
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:35,360
met a gentleman that was actually in on

986
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:38,960
the same path as we were and he almost

987
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:40,820
figured out how to put the glycerin

988
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:44,090
inside the you know inside the

989
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:46,730
electronic cigarette and we we worked

990
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:48,700
hard then it was still difficult because

991
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:53,240
of the cotton inside then we met up with

992
00:40:48,699 --> 00:40:57,279
Michael Backus from cornerstone Research

993
00:40:53,239 --> 00:41:01,250
Center in an Eagle Rock California

994
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:02,900
that's when he said I will put this on

995
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:05,150
my shelf if you can get rid of the

996
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:07,519
cotton inside the oil tank which is

997
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:09,110
basically which was based on electronic

998
00:41:07,519 --> 00:41:11,150
cigarette technology back then

999
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:15,920
you had to have cotton to be the medium

1000
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:17,930
tool hold the the glycerin no and at

1001
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:20,300
that time I said well it's impossible he

1002
00:41:17,929 --> 00:41:22,429
goes well I'll put it on my shelf if you

1003
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:25,850
actually can't get rid of the cotton so

1004
00:41:22,429 --> 00:41:28,730
I went back and I back to the drawing

1005
00:41:25,849 --> 00:41:34,159
board and I went through maybe about 50

1006
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:36,289
prototypes and a lot of a lot of fees

1007
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:39,259
doing a molding in the research and

1008
00:41:36,289 --> 00:41:43,000
designs on them and in 2011 we

1009
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:47,060
introduced the first oil tank that had

1010
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:49,670
no cotton inside so that was that that's

1011
00:41:47,059 --> 00:41:53,900
what revolutionized industry because

1012
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:56,480
you look at it every other tank had had

1013
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:58,579
the cotton and had the the heating

1014
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:00,409
element wrapped around it or inside of

1015
00:41:58,579 --> 00:42:02,450
the cotton so after a few years you

1016
00:42:00,409 --> 00:42:06,529
would actually start getting that burnt

1017
00:42:02,449 --> 00:42:09,199
taste and in 2011 when we introduced

1018
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:10,730
that we we sat back a little bit we're

1019
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:13,368
like you know

1020
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:15,108
patting ourselves in the back because we

1021
00:42:13,369 --> 00:42:16,760
did something where nobody else was able

1022
00:42:15,108 --> 00:42:19,759
to do but before the two thousand eleven

1023
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:22,430
we were also able to get pure oils into

1024
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:25,670
the cotton cartridges which nobody else

1025
00:42:22,429 --> 00:42:30,469
was able to do as well so fast forward

1026
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:32,809
after 2011 2012 2013 now we had another

1027
00:42:30,469 --> 00:42:36,108
design that had the ceramic this is

1028
00:42:32,809 --> 00:42:37,609
where we're we're talking about where

1029
00:42:36,108 --> 00:42:39,409
you said all your designs were in the

1030
00:42:37,608 --> 00:42:41,960
trash and nobody was using him and all

1031
00:42:39,409 --> 00:42:47,989
of a sudden just became popular well in

1032
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:51,318
2000 in the late 2012/2013 era we came

1033
00:42:47,989 --> 00:42:53,209
out with the the essential oil tank that

1034
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:56,358
had the ceramic wicks and all of that

1035
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:58,818
well we only did a small production run

1036
00:42:56,358 --> 00:43:01,848
of a hundred to get a feedback of people

1037
00:42:58,818 --> 00:43:05,029
and how it's used it it had issues and

1038
00:43:01,849 --> 00:43:06,829
it just didn't work right so we shelved

1039
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:08,030
that whole design and we decided to go

1040
00:43:06,829 --> 00:43:09,920
to different route with the kiss

1041
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:15,579
cartridge where it slowed as you go lake

1042
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:18,858
systems and when we shelve that idea we

1043
00:43:15,579 --> 00:43:21,680
we actually totally forgot it that we

1044
00:43:18,858 --> 00:43:23,179
shelve the ideal with a manufacturer

1045
00:43:21,679 --> 00:43:27,769
that we don't work with anyone because

1046
00:43:23,179 --> 00:43:29,659
after 2013 we decided to open up a long

1047
00:43:27,769 --> 00:43:32,210
manufacturing because our most of our

1048
00:43:29,659 --> 00:43:33,710
ideas and you know designs were being

1049
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:36,220
literally licensed out to other

1050
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:40,519
companies where we had no control over

1051
00:43:36,219 --> 00:43:42,529
so when when we shoved that idea and we

1052
00:43:40,519 --> 00:43:46,239
will concentrate on the Hercules and the

1053
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:51,950
kiss cartridges in 2013 early 2013

1054
00:43:46,239 --> 00:43:54,409
afterwards we went we started working on

1055
00:43:51,949 --> 00:43:58,068
the Triton series and which has yet to

1056
00:43:54,409 --> 00:44:00,500
come out and all our design is where we

1057
00:43:58,068 --> 00:44:01,259
enforce reinforce the kiss cartridge

1058
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:03,030
made it even

1059
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:07,050
better every year with every iteration

1060
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:10,470
of it coming out now the last two years

1061
00:44:07,050 --> 00:44:12,630
I was looking at it and and all of these

1062
00:44:10,469 --> 00:44:14,730
cartridges seem to come out and had

1063
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:16,590
prefilled the prefilled market within

1064
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:18,449
the past two years worse bulla started

1065
00:44:16,590 --> 00:44:20,340
booming and I'm looking at the

1066
00:44:18,449 --> 00:44:21,689
cartridges I'm looking at it I'm elected

1067
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:24,480
this is my design

1068
00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:28,289
you know everything that I've done in

1069
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:32,369
the essential oil tanks since 2008 up

1070
00:44:28,289 --> 00:44:35,429
until 2012 is now being used in the

1071
00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:38,159
refill market and when I came out of

1072
00:44:35,429 --> 00:44:40,079
like a dude that's my design and people

1073
00:44:38,159 --> 00:44:41,670
are like no that's not your design man

1074
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:45,319
you're just acting stupid it's not your

1075
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:48,920
design I go listen man this I even have

1076
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:52,250
forum conversations by now showing

1077
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:56,700
images of a ceramic core back in

1078
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:59,429
2012-2013 you know on the on on tanks

1079
00:44:56,699 --> 00:45:00,989
and guess what these new tanks are using

1080
00:44:59,429 --> 00:45:03,089
the same design

1081
00:45:00,989 --> 00:45:05,609
yeah it's changed but it is based on

1082
00:45:03,090 --> 00:45:09,860
that design because it's still you know

1083
00:45:05,610 --> 00:45:13,170
so fast forward until now we

1084
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:15,990
reintroduced the pure titanium grade

1085
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:19,369
heaters inside the cartridges and we

1086
00:45:15,989 --> 00:45:22,500
introduced the silicon carbide wicks

1087
00:45:19,369 --> 00:45:24,119
check this out in 2013 when we started

1088
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:27,059
using the silicon carbide wakes we

1089
00:45:24,119 --> 00:45:28,889
started calling them black ceramics we

1090
00:45:27,059 --> 00:45:31,949
call them black ceramics just for fun

1091
00:45:28,889 --> 00:45:33,239
because we we were pretty sure that the

1092
00:45:31,949 --> 00:45:34,919
companies out there would start calling

1093
00:45:33,239 --> 00:45:38,939
him black ceramic without knowing what

1094
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:41,369
it was so well fast forward in 2016 2017

1095
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:45,599
and 2018 one company started putting

1096
00:45:41,369 --> 00:45:48,440
black ceramics into their oil vaporizers

1097
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:49,619
we started calling our silicon carbide

1098
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:54,030
okay

1099
00:45:49,619 --> 00:45:55,769
and being silicon carbide because it was

1100
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:58,710
silicon carbide we just called it black

1101
00:45:55,769 --> 00:46:00,539
ceramic well now companies are like oh

1102
00:45:58,710 --> 00:46:02,849
well well now we're offering black

1103
00:46:00,539 --> 00:46:04,769
ceramics I mean a silicon carbide - whoa

1104
00:46:02,849 --> 00:46:07,319
for two years you didn't know what was

1105
00:46:04,769 --> 00:46:10,820
inside your cartridges you know you're

1106
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:14,550
calling on plastics you

1107
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:16,349
so so when we started calling a silicon

1108
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:17,730
carbide there all of a sudden you know

1109
00:46:16,349 --> 00:46:19,200
left and right there coming out what

1110
00:46:17,730 --> 00:46:21,269
cartridges that have now silicon

1111
00:46:19,199 --> 00:46:23,009
carbides in them well if they now have

1112
00:46:21,269 --> 00:46:25,769
silicon carbide in and what do they have

1113
00:46:23,010 --> 00:46:34,410
before it was just ceramic painted black

1114
00:46:25,769 --> 00:46:37,320
yeah also so fast forward until now how

1115
00:46:34,409 --> 00:46:40,348
do I put this our main goal was in 2008

1116
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:43,680
was for the patients and by the patients

1117
00:46:40,349 --> 00:46:46,170
because I was financed by patients by

1118
00:46:43,679 --> 00:46:48,539
old hippies by old grandmothers

1119
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:51,800
literally the people who helped me build

1120
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:55,588
the dispensary are the people that

1121
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:57,960
helped me finance the ideas that I had

1122
00:46:55,588 --> 00:47:00,420
and until this day you know I will never

1123
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:02,369
give up on that word if I if my company

1124
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:02,940
is gonna go down fine I'll go down

1125
00:47:02,369 --> 00:47:05,940
swinging

1126
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:07,769
but I'm not gonna I'm not gonna market

1127
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:09,990
[ __ ] I'm not gonna use butchers

1128
00:47:07,769 --> 00:47:13,289
marketing tactics I'm not gonna [ __ ]

1129
00:47:09,989 --> 00:47:15,858
anybody and you know the that's the

1130
00:47:13,289 --> 00:47:18,599
whole story of how we came into play is

1131
00:47:15,858 --> 00:47:20,848
because I saw an electronic cigarette

1132
00:47:18,599 --> 00:47:23,068
and because I said because Michael

1133
00:47:20,849 --> 00:47:25,559
Backus said you know you can't I'll put

1134
00:47:23,068 --> 00:47:27,539
it on my shelf once you can do this and

1135
00:47:25,559 --> 00:47:30,029
because of a couple of people along the

1136
00:47:27,539 --> 00:47:32,338
way said you can't do it and I did you

1137
00:47:30,030 --> 00:47:38,010
know I guess invention is the necessity

1138
00:47:32,338 --> 00:47:40,139
of the of the time where if you're not

1139
00:47:38,010 --> 00:47:40,650
put into a place where you have to get

1140
00:47:40,139 --> 00:47:42,088
out

1141
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:44,940
you're not going to invent that's how I

1142
00:47:42,088 --> 00:47:47,309
think with well there's no doubt about

1143
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:50,429
that the pen market sure blew up in a

1144
00:47:47,309 --> 00:47:52,500
big huge way and it's kind of like you

1145
00:47:50,429 --> 00:47:54,719
know not until I met your your old

1146
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:56,489
employee they're samurais Sam when he

1147
00:47:54,719 --> 00:47:58,679
came up and took all these pens apart

1148
00:47:56,489 --> 00:48:00,088
showed me how terrible they were and how

1149
00:47:58,679 --> 00:48:02,068
everything was super close to the

1150
00:48:00,088 --> 00:48:05,130
elements and how solder was getting

1151
00:48:02,068 --> 00:48:07,230
baked and he's caught and like all these

1152
00:48:05,130 --> 00:48:09,088
different things and sort of started

1153
00:48:07,230 --> 00:48:11,039
explaining to me about your company I

1154
00:48:09,088 --> 00:48:12,838
was like oh okay yeah I can't like just

1155
00:48:11,039 --> 00:48:14,489
be using these things not that I use

1156
00:48:12,838 --> 00:48:15,659
them a lot I'd take them up on the

1157
00:48:14,489 --> 00:48:16,799
mountain where I didn't want to have a

1158
00:48:15,659 --> 00:48:19,769
dab ring or whatnot

1159
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:21,510
but it definitely feels better when it's

1160
00:48:19,769 --> 00:48:23,460
this niche like for me there's so like

1161
00:48:21,510 --> 00:48:25,830
every vaporizer company

1162
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:29,849
in here right now every vaporizer I have

1163
00:48:25,829 --> 00:48:31,980
like 20 or 25 vaporizers I have a whole

1164
00:48:29,849 --> 00:48:33,750
variety because I find the best one to

1165
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:37,429
be the one that suits me at the time

1166
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:40,409
that I need it well you gotta understand

1167
00:48:37,429 --> 00:48:43,710
I totally understand but the market

1168
00:48:40,409 --> 00:48:46,279
right now do you have to I'm laughing

1169
00:48:43,710 --> 00:48:50,090
myself and I'm sometimes even like

1170
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:52,620
pulling my hair out is why would people

1171
00:48:50,090 --> 00:48:55,230
why would people say it's okay to use

1172
00:48:52,619 --> 00:48:58,109
stainless steel as a heating element why

1173
00:48:55,230 --> 00:49:00,449
would people say it's okay to use Teflon

1174
00:48:58,110 --> 00:49:03,930
like a millimeter away from the heating

1175
00:49:00,449 --> 00:49:06,629
element you know but right now that is

1176
00:49:03,929 --> 00:49:09,089
the thing it's people literally don't

1177
00:49:06,630 --> 00:49:13,619
care it's how cheap you can make it and

1178
00:49:09,090 --> 00:49:17,400
how fast you can make it you know finish

1179
00:49:13,619 --> 00:49:19,829
now the market itself there's a lot of

1180
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:22,559
dubious players in it where they've good

1181
00:49:19,829 --> 00:49:24,929
already gone in and you know they give

1182
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:27,150
out 50 free samples and all of a sudden

1183
00:49:24,929 --> 00:49:29,369
all blah blah blah you know this is just

1184
00:49:27,150 --> 00:49:31,769
the greatest thing well when you like

1185
00:49:29,369 --> 00:49:33,569
point out oh well it has this inside the

1186
00:49:31,769 --> 00:49:35,880
heater how's it better what is just

1187
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:37,590
better it's just better you you you you

1188
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:42,410
know it's just that it's better than

1189
00:49:37,590 --> 00:49:46,430
your product it's just better but how I

1190
00:49:42,409 --> 00:49:50,429
have an uptick right here oh we have the

1191
00:49:46,429 --> 00:49:53,339
Omicron yeah I think that that moves us

1192
00:49:50,429 --> 00:49:55,609
perfectly sorry I muted myself by

1193
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:58,620
accident that moves us perfectly into

1194
00:49:55,610 --> 00:50:00,000
Mark McCoy and the for a company because

1195
00:49:58,619 --> 00:50:02,279
when I first met mark

1196
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,590
he was like yeah you gotta have the sty

1197
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:07,500
nail gun you gotta have the ceramic core

1198
00:50:04,590 --> 00:50:09,269
I'm like ceramic core tell me more what

1199
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:11,190
what do you speak up so why don't you

1200
00:50:09,269 --> 00:50:14,789
give us your lowdown mark on how you

1201
00:50:11,190 --> 00:50:17,610
came to be passionate about vaporization

1202
00:50:14,789 --> 00:50:19,920
I mean again I was just coming from that

1203
00:50:17,610 --> 00:50:21,690
woman hit snapped through school of

1204
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:24,389
water pipe smoke in the West Coast style

1205
00:50:21,690 --> 00:50:26,849
I mean admittedly I perhaps started a

1206
00:50:24,389 --> 00:50:29,250
little more on the recreational tint but

1207
00:50:26,849 --> 00:50:31,409
a long time I subscribed to Dennis

1208
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:33,480
perón's perspective that it's really all

1209
00:50:31,409 --> 00:50:35,909
medical because whether you're taking

1210
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:37,360
that rip to chill and watch a movie or

1211
00:50:35,909 --> 00:50:39,159
skating create you're still

1212
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:42,309
medical benefit whether you like it or

1213
00:50:39,159 --> 00:50:44,319
not as as I got a little bit older and

1214
00:50:42,309 --> 00:50:47,440
some of the aches and pains kicked in I

1215
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:49,570
realized I'd actually broken my back as

1216
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:51,460
a teenager and had some pretty severe

1217
00:50:49,570 --> 00:50:54,190
muscle spasticity coming from something

1218
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:57,220
that wasn't gonna easily heal I realized

1219
00:50:54,190 --> 00:51:00,159
that the cannabis literally just made

1220
00:50:57,219 --> 00:51:02,259
those spasms disappears so freaking fast

1221
00:51:00,159 --> 00:51:04,480
without the side effects of the

1222
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:08,790
pharmaceuticals that the doctors who in

1223
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:11,650
all their wisdom were prescribing and I

1224
00:51:08,789 --> 00:51:14,679
wasn't as active at the time because I

1225
00:51:11,650 --> 00:51:16,809
was a little bit laid up and you know I

1226
00:51:14,679 --> 00:51:20,049
kind of transitioned from water pipe

1227
00:51:16,809 --> 00:51:23,349
smoking with the lighters to uncoated

1228
00:51:20,050 --> 00:51:25,450
wood matches to vaporizing with heat

1229
00:51:23,349 --> 00:51:28,299
guns and it just made the really an

1230
00:51:25,449 --> 00:51:30,069
organic transition and at the time I'd

1231
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:31,870
been studying medical aromatherapy the

1232
00:51:30,070 --> 00:51:34,780
work of the Swiss and the French and was

1233
00:51:31,869 --> 00:51:38,170
very interested in natural cosmetics and

1234
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:44,380
essential oils and yeah I want to say

1235
00:51:38,170 --> 00:51:46,000
that was late 90s and 95 96 and it's you

1236
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:48,700
know I've gotten turned on to the to the

1237
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:53,380
to the Eagle bill vape by Doug Mineola

1238
00:51:48,699 --> 00:51:55,000
and Adam Dunn that that sort of changed

1239
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:57,250
everything for me I was working on a

1240
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:00,280
shower apparatus for putting essential

1241
00:51:57,250 --> 00:52:01,389
oils into your shower water flow and I

1242
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:02,980
woke up in the middle of the night one

1243
00:52:01,389 --> 00:52:04,869
night after playing with the heat gun

1244
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:06,820
for I don't know maybe three or four

1245
00:52:04,869 --> 00:52:08,380
months and I realized the fluid

1246
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:10,780
mechanics and the gas mechanics were

1247
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:13,140
exactly the same and the only way I was

1248
00:52:10,780 --> 00:52:15,640
going to emulate that real fulfilling

1249
00:52:13,139 --> 00:52:18,819
full-spectrum rip I was able to get out

1250
00:52:15,639 --> 00:52:21,309
of a small glass bowl with very careful

1251
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:23,500
slow lighting with the wood match was

1252
00:52:21,309 --> 00:52:25,750
with the venturi effect Bernoulli's

1253
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:27,190
principle realizable she's been right

1254
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:29,769
here in front of the whole time so I

1255
00:52:27,190 --> 00:52:31,990
developed the concept of the two-piece

1256
00:52:29,769 --> 00:52:33,429
vaporization chamber bull wrote some

1257
00:52:31,989 --> 00:52:36,339
notes middle the night went back to

1258
00:52:33,429 --> 00:52:39,489
sleep and the next day I was in Berkeley

1259
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:40,990
California at R&amp;D glass basically

1260
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:44,529
groveling to get them to make some

1261
00:52:40,989 --> 00:52:46,389
pieces for me and I told myself at the

1262
00:52:44,530 --> 00:52:48,280
time I was not going to enjoy any

1263
00:52:46,389 --> 00:52:50,139
cannabis until I figured it out I

1264
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:51,200
thought it might just be a couple of

1265
00:52:50,139 --> 00:52:52,879
iterations

1266
00:52:51,199 --> 00:52:54,739
well actually I thought naively I might

1267
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:56,360
nail it right out of the gate and the

1268
00:52:54,739 --> 00:52:58,099
flow form physics lo and behold a little

1269
00:52:56,360 --> 00:53:00,260
more complicated than one might think

1270
00:52:58,099 --> 00:53:02,929
took me about took me about three months

1271
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:05,750
my bros were all very happy to be the

1272
00:53:02,929 --> 00:53:09,349
guinea pigs but I'll never forget when

1273
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:10,489
we finally figured it out and we created

1274
00:53:09,349 --> 00:53:12,799
a chamber bowl that worked really well

1275
00:53:10,489 --> 00:53:15,559
with the old-style guns and I'd already

1276
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:16,940
looked at some of these heat guns you

1277
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:18,590
know they've been in the history of some

1278
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:20,200
of the cannabis pioneers playing with

1279
00:53:18,590 --> 00:53:22,880
them for a while

1280
00:53:20,199 --> 00:53:24,789
figured out that the the Stein L German

1281
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:27,230
design Swiss manufactured ones had a

1282
00:53:24,789 --> 00:53:31,550
stainless nozzle and a non alumina

1283
00:53:27,230 --> 00:53:33,019
ceramic encapsulated nichrome element so

1284
00:53:31,550 --> 00:53:36,980
your air was actually going past the

1285
00:53:33,019 --> 00:53:39,980
ceramic and the stainless and although

1286
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:43,369
far from perfect it worked pretty

1287
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:45,740
freakin well rigged up with a nice sized

1288
00:53:43,369 --> 00:53:48,769
water pipe and we were able to dial in

1289
00:53:45,739 --> 00:53:50,989
the technique to get a really full

1290
00:53:48,769 --> 00:53:53,030
profile of vapor right to the edge of

1291
00:53:50,989 --> 00:53:55,099
smoke or just barely beyond if you

1292
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:57,470
wanted that hybrid experience or even

1293
00:53:55,099 --> 00:54:00,019
lower temp and just just vaping on the

1294
00:53:57,469 --> 00:54:01,789
terpenes if that was your thing and led

1295
00:54:00,019 --> 00:54:04,070
to all kinds of experimentation with

1296
00:54:01,789 --> 00:54:07,730
other herbs and botanicals mixed and on

1297
00:54:04,070 --> 00:54:10,220
their own and of course eventually with

1298
00:54:07,730 --> 00:54:13,579
the inside of my beekeeper brownie boo

1299
00:54:10,219 --> 00:54:16,339
our beekeeper brownie boo we start

1300
00:54:13,579 --> 00:54:18,920
playing with propolis and really

1301
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:20,780
vaporizing the same way the recipients

1302
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:22,309
did because they always had propolis on

1303
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:24,590
their rocks and those steam tents they

1304
00:54:22,309 --> 00:54:26,210
were throwing their their cannabis seeds

1305
00:54:24,590 --> 00:54:28,250
there by the article in herb but

1306
00:54:26,210 --> 00:54:31,340
remember where the seeds come from seeds

1307
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:32,960
are in the flowers so the Citians also

1308
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:35,240
get credit for being the first to really

1309
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:39,590
vaporize specifically flower material

1310
00:54:35,239 --> 00:54:42,069
and yeah here we are today we took a few

1311
00:54:39,590 --> 00:54:45,829
iterations on the bowls ultimately

1312
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:47,539
glassblower Steve they're inspired Jason

1313
00:54:45,829 --> 00:54:50,869
King with some of his inside-out pieces

1314
00:54:47,539 --> 00:54:54,230
on soldering irons and I paid Steve to

1315
00:54:50,869 --> 00:54:56,659
make some iterations for us that we

1316
00:54:54,230 --> 00:54:58,490
played with for years Sabo was one of

1317
00:54:56,659 --> 00:55:01,519
the one of the early adaptors got to

1318
00:54:58,489 --> 00:55:03,079
play with it and I remember just not

1319
00:55:01,519 --> 00:55:04,889
thinking the world was ready for a hot

1320
00:55:03,079 --> 00:55:07,500
piece of glass but

1321
00:55:04,889 --> 00:55:09,089
in fact I'll give sable a lot of credit

1322
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:10,949
is the one of the bros who really was

1323
00:55:09,090 --> 00:55:14,579
like man you got to just turn people on

1324
00:55:10,949 --> 00:55:16,349
to this it's time and yeah you know we

1325
00:55:14,579 --> 00:55:17,969
we took a few iterations getting the

1326
00:55:16,349 --> 00:55:19,650
elements right and getting you know the

1327
00:55:17,969 --> 00:55:21,059
glass sorted so that we could make in a

1328
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:24,869
production environment it's still the

1329
00:55:21,059 --> 00:55:26,489
hardest piece we make but when you yeah

1330
00:55:24,869 --> 00:55:32,159
when you dial into it if you like the

1331
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:34,109
ritual of water pipe smoking to it milk

1332
00:55:32,159 --> 00:55:36,259
it up take a rip you know to your taste

1333
00:55:34,110 --> 00:55:39,690
you can dial it to the way you like to

1334
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:42,870
session it's hard to beat man it's uh

1335
00:55:39,690 --> 00:55:45,210
you know I still get a lot of emails

1336
00:55:42,869 --> 00:55:47,369
from folks just saying you know I love

1337
00:55:45,210 --> 00:55:49,110
the system but I I got it you know you

1338
00:55:47,369 --> 00:55:52,230
kind of ruined everything else for me

1339
00:55:49,110 --> 00:55:54,390
surprise was that was that the based on

1340
00:55:52,230 --> 00:55:57,139
the hot glass yeah the hot glass that's

1341
00:55:54,389 --> 00:56:00,750
right yeah Brian's brother that's right

1342
00:55:57,139 --> 00:56:02,670
well Brian's brother cuz Brian was the

1343
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:04,409
one that turned me on to it but he was

1344
00:56:02,670 --> 00:56:06,480
he told me really it was his brother

1345
00:56:04,409 --> 00:56:07,949
that kind of designed it and I guess he

1346
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:09,570
would blow the glass for it but yeah

1347
00:56:07,949 --> 00:56:12,269
that's great that you guys are still

1348
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:14,190
doing those since I thought it was

1349
00:56:12,269 --> 00:56:16,320
lightweight and easy it went in and out

1350
00:56:14,190 --> 00:56:19,500
of the bowl nice and it definitely was

1351
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:21,990
glass on glass on glass yeah we now have

1352
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:23,820
glass screens we have custom tool joints

1353
00:56:21,989 --> 00:56:26,569
so you can pretty much plug and play on

1354
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:29,910
any water pipe or bubbler out there and

1355
00:56:26,570 --> 00:56:32,309
yeah all all glass heating extraction

1356
00:56:29,909 --> 00:56:34,049
and delivery and what I've found is even

1357
00:56:32,309 --> 00:56:35,940
relative to many of the technical

1358
00:56:34,050 --> 00:56:37,830
ceramics that I've played with you

1359
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:41,039
simply can't get a better terpene

1360
00:56:37,829 --> 00:56:43,469
expression then with all glass or quartz

1361
00:56:41,039 --> 00:56:45,630
that neutral polarity of those materials

1362
00:56:43,469 --> 00:56:47,819
really does make a difference you know

1363
00:56:45,630 --> 00:56:51,150
people are talking terms quite a bit

1364
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:52,830
these days but you know the the it's not

1365
00:56:51,150 --> 00:56:56,190
just about the chemistry it's about the

1366
00:56:52,829 --> 00:56:58,289
polarity the energetic component and if

1367
00:56:56,190 --> 00:57:00,420
you're using a metal element or metal

1368
00:56:58,289 --> 00:57:02,429
chambers or even metal screens to some

1369
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:05,010
extent you're you're changing the

1370
00:57:02,429 --> 00:57:06,659
expression from what you would have got

1371
00:57:05,010 --> 00:57:09,560
just in those first couple pulls off a

1372
00:57:06,659 --> 00:57:11,879
proper cone agreed a hundred percent

1373
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:14,099
particularly having a terpene company

1374
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:16,329
and having access to terpene profiles

1375
00:57:14,099 --> 00:57:18,369
derived from cannabis

1376
00:57:16,329 --> 00:57:19,960
and and having access to all these

1377
00:57:18,369 --> 00:57:22,960
different vaporizers it leads us

1378
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:25,780
beautifully into Sabo from VAP exhale

1379
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:27,869
because the vape exhale was the first

1380
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:31,510
unit that I found I could legitimately

1381
00:57:27,869 --> 00:57:33,460
preserve the terpene profile from pure

1382
00:57:31,510 --> 00:57:36,070
Terps because I was hitting them on like

1383
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:39,190
a d-mail like a sick dish or a sapphire

1384
00:57:36,070 --> 00:57:40,690
dish or quartz banger and they were they

1385
00:57:39,190 --> 00:57:41,980
were delicious don't get me wrong but it

1386
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:44,320
wasn't until I hit it through the vamp

1387
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:46,659
exhale a super low temp in the quartz

1388
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:49,510
rod dropped into the glass tube with the

1389
00:57:46,659 --> 00:57:51,219
heated like just the preservation that's

1390
00:57:49,510 --> 00:57:54,190
the word I use constantly I'm like it

1391
00:57:51,219 --> 00:57:55,750
preserves the [ __ ] profile this is

1392
00:57:54,190 --> 00:57:57,820
almost what it smells like when you

1393
00:57:55,750 --> 00:58:00,730
smell it in the jar rather than it just

1394
00:57:57,820 --> 00:58:02,710
it made me realize how different it was

1395
00:58:00,730 --> 00:58:04,329
you know convection versus conduction I

1396
00:58:02,710 --> 00:58:06,309
guess you would say like putting it

1397
00:58:04,329 --> 00:58:09,819
right on that dish and having it just

1398
00:58:06,309 --> 00:58:13,090
explode is not as gentle as having it go

1399
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:17,860
into the vape exhale tube and just like

1400
00:58:13,090 --> 00:58:19,480
gently volatize into into my bubbler so

1401
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:21,309
why don't you go ahead Sabo introduce

1402
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:23,590
yourself tell us tell us about the

1403
00:58:21,309 --> 00:58:26,019
vaping sale and how you came to be I

1404
00:58:23,590 --> 00:58:27,579
know it's relatively new but your

1405
00:58:26,019 --> 00:58:31,989
history might go back further I don't

1406
00:58:27,579 --> 00:58:33,699
know give us a go yeah so we talked

1407
00:58:31,989 --> 00:58:36,759
about standing on the shoulders of

1408
00:58:33,699 --> 00:58:40,389
giants and well there's one I'm staring

1409
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:42,820
at him right now mark McCoy so I give a

1410
00:58:40,389 --> 00:58:46,329
lot of credit actually pretty much

1411
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:48,820
everything I know I owe to mark I was

1412
00:58:46,329 --> 00:58:52,029
lucky enough when I started consuming

1413
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:53,890
cannabis as a 21 year old I I was really

1414
00:58:52,030 --> 00:58:57,280
late to the game just because I felt

1415
00:58:53,889 --> 00:58:59,469
that as a health conscious person I

1416
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:01,900
didn't want to put any smoke in my body

1417
00:58:59,469 --> 00:59:04,269
but I had been a stunt man putting

1418
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:06,430
myself through college and the injuries

1419
00:59:04,269 --> 00:59:09,009
were building up and finally I started

1420
00:59:06,429 --> 00:59:11,819
utilizing some cannabis and I bought the

1421
00:59:09,010 --> 00:59:16,180
first vaporizer I bought was the BC vape

1422
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:19,930
it wasn't very good and then ultimately

1423
00:59:16,179 --> 00:59:22,869
I bought the Brit tech system and I

1424
00:59:19,929 --> 00:59:25,349
noticed that the return address was in

1425
00:59:22,869 --> 00:59:28,809
the same hometown that I grew up and

1426
00:59:25,349 --> 00:59:29,358
ultimately I emailed Marky allowed me to

1427
00:59:28,809 --> 00:59:31,728
come over

1428
00:59:29,358 --> 00:59:34,818
I'd only been consuming cannabis for a

1429
00:59:31,728 --> 00:59:37,009
few months at that time and so he was

1430
00:59:34,818 --> 00:59:39,558
really educating not just it's not just

1431
00:59:37,009 --> 00:59:42,619
the at the vaporization aspects of

1432
00:59:39,559 --> 00:59:44,959
cannabis but just cannabis in general

1433
00:59:42,619 --> 00:59:46,969
very holistically how it was grown how

1434
00:59:44,958 --> 00:59:51,288
it was cured how you make hash how you

1435
00:59:46,969 --> 00:59:53,450
how you trim it properly so I feel very

1436
00:59:51,289 --> 00:59:56,719
very lucky from the get-go that I was

1437
00:59:53,449 --> 00:59:58,248
learning from my Yoda Jedi Master and he

1438
00:59:56,719 --> 00:59:59,450
kind of introduced me to a bunch of

1439
00:59:58,248 --> 01:00:02,179
different people like you know I

1440
00:59:59,449 --> 01:00:04,159
remembered the bubble bags you know like

1441
01:00:02,179 --> 01:00:06,288
he was telling me all about hash I at

1442
01:00:04,159 --> 01:00:08,929
that point I was just getting into flour

1443
01:00:06,289 --> 01:00:11,630
so this hash thing was like way beyond

1444
01:00:08,929 --> 01:00:13,308
me and ultimately you know like he

1445
01:00:11,630 --> 01:00:16,068
showed me all these different systems I

1446
01:00:13,309 --> 01:00:17,839
love the heat gun system it was one of

1447
01:00:16,068 --> 01:00:19,818
my favorites I introduced so many of my

1448
01:00:17,838 --> 01:00:23,719
friends in college to it and then when

1449
01:00:19,818 --> 01:00:26,088
he moved to the to the glass wand style

1450
01:00:23,719 --> 01:00:28,579
it was just amazing and as he mentioned

1451
01:00:26,088 --> 01:00:31,099
you know I was really encouraging him to

1452
01:00:28,579 --> 01:00:34,818
really get the word out and to really

1453
01:00:31,099 --> 01:00:37,789
promote this this type of ingestion

1454
01:00:34,818 --> 01:00:39,619
methodology and I just love vaporization

1455
01:00:37,789 --> 01:00:42,650
in general I bought the vapor brothers

1456
01:00:39,619 --> 01:00:43,759
I'm a customer of the w-9 up tech

1457
01:00:42,650 --> 01:00:46,039
products as well

1458
01:00:43,759 --> 01:00:48,139
his sales rep used to come over and show

1459
01:00:46,039 --> 01:00:51,469
me the ins and outs of how to use the

1460
01:00:48,139 --> 01:00:54,170
pen so I just feel really really blessed

1461
01:00:51,469 --> 01:00:55,909
to be here to be able to talk about you

1462
01:00:54,170 --> 01:00:57,889
know vaporization in general and also

1463
01:00:55,909 --> 01:01:01,788
kind of what what inspired me and

1464
01:00:57,889 --> 01:01:04,518
ultimately mark is also a well he not

1465
01:01:01,789 --> 01:01:07,249
only influenced me on healthy cannabis

1466
01:01:04,518 --> 01:01:10,278
consumption but you know mark is a very

1467
01:01:07,248 --> 01:01:12,828
active person he also eats a very you

1468
01:01:10,278 --> 01:01:15,858
know healthy diet so I try to emulate a

1469
01:01:12,829 --> 01:01:17,568
lot of those things and really try to be

1470
01:01:15,858 --> 01:01:19,009
a healthy person holistically you know

1471
01:01:17,568 --> 01:01:21,558
not just with my cannabis consumption

1472
01:01:19,009 --> 01:01:24,409
but with how I treated my body with

1473
01:01:21,559 --> 01:01:26,089
exercise what I put into my body even

1474
01:01:24,409 --> 01:01:28,909
some you know spiritual type of

1475
01:01:26,088 --> 01:01:31,909
development as well and ultimately you

1476
01:01:28,909 --> 01:01:38,808
know I've had bought over 150 different

1477
01:01:31,909 --> 01:01:41,208
vaporizers from 1997 to 2011 at that

1478
01:01:38,809 --> 01:01:43,069
time I had been working at a start-up

1479
01:01:41,208 --> 01:01:47,659
actually the startup was really

1480
01:01:43,068 --> 01:01:50,150
- to Mark's house and my boss after we

1481
01:01:47,659 --> 01:01:51,949
had sold our company in the Salesforce

1482
01:01:50,150 --> 01:01:54,680
my boss was asking me what I was doing

1483
01:01:51,949 --> 01:01:58,099
and I told him I had been helping mark

1484
01:01:54,679 --> 01:02:00,588
sell vaporizers and ultimately he asked

1485
01:01:58,099 --> 01:02:02,390
if um you know if he gave me some

1486
01:02:00,588 --> 01:02:04,969
capital if we could design one ourselves

1487
01:02:02,389 --> 01:02:08,028
and that was the impetus for creating

1488
01:02:04,969 --> 01:02:09,708
the device I called my good buddy mark I

1489
01:02:08,028 --> 01:02:13,579
told him I had this opportunity to

1490
01:02:09,708 --> 01:02:16,399
create a vaporizer and if he be okay

1491
01:02:13,579 --> 01:02:18,469
with it he gave me his blessing so you

1492
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:20,568
know as a I think we were talking about

1493
01:02:18,469 --> 01:02:22,699
at the beginning I mean Dennis Peron

1494
01:02:20,568 --> 01:02:24,558
just passed away yesterday there's a lot

1495
01:02:22,699 --> 01:02:28,269
of people here that influenced us that

1496
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:30,380
gave us this opportunity to be here and

1497
01:02:28,268 --> 01:02:32,088
you know I think it's important to let

1498
01:02:30,380 --> 01:02:34,400
mark know and I think he knows I mean

1499
01:02:32,088 --> 01:02:36,078
he's been to my wedding we were on an

1500
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:38,539
airplane together we got a chance to

1501
01:02:36,079 --> 01:02:41,150
catch up recently but if I've never told

1502
01:02:38,539 --> 01:02:42,829
him this you know he is he is the guy

1503
01:02:41,150 --> 01:02:45,259
that taught me everything and the reason

1504
01:02:42,829 --> 01:02:47,630
I'm I'm sitting here so thank you Mark

1505
01:02:45,259 --> 01:02:50,539
and and that's my story hopefully it

1506
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:52,579
didn't put people to sleep nice say well

1507
01:02:50,539 --> 01:02:55,759
very nice shout out tomorrow you come

1508
01:02:52,579 --> 01:02:57,469
out absolutely I think it was pretty

1509
01:02:55,759 --> 01:02:58,818
accurate - I've known you a long time I

1510
01:02:57,469 --> 01:03:00,909
would agree with pretty much everything

1511
01:02:58,818 --> 01:03:04,458
he just said I was stoked

1512
01:03:00,909 --> 01:03:06,679
I actually remember the stories John was

1513
01:03:04,458 --> 01:03:09,498
Tommy's are like yeah I'm actually gonna

1514
01:03:06,679 --> 01:03:13,639
go meet save where I play Patel and talk

1515
01:03:09,498 --> 01:03:15,468
about his VAP Excel that I think the

1516
01:03:13,639 --> 01:03:18,768
evil that at that time was coming out in

1517
01:03:15,469 --> 01:03:21,229
2012 caroused the model stable yeah so

1518
01:03:18,768 --> 01:03:23,629
he actually was meeting with you to talk

1519
01:03:21,228 --> 01:03:25,728
about the Evo and all of that and he

1520
01:03:23,630 --> 01:03:27,559
told me that you guys were actually

1521
01:03:25,728 --> 01:03:30,379
using the Omicron - older versions of

1522
01:03:27,559 --> 01:03:33,259
the old crones where you you guys had

1523
01:03:30,380 --> 01:03:35,749
your sessions together and hopefully we

1524
01:03:33,259 --> 01:03:37,670
can meet up because I even told him back

1525
01:03:35,748 --> 01:03:39,889
then as I wish I was up there with you

1526
01:03:37,670 --> 01:03:42,229
guys you know get to meet sit down on

1527
01:03:39,889 --> 01:03:45,199
top but hopefully after this so we can

1528
01:03:42,228 --> 01:03:47,149
you know all exchange contact

1529
01:03:45,199 --> 01:03:49,548
information you know talk to each other

1530
01:03:47,150 --> 01:03:51,410
about the industry and all of that you

1531
01:03:49,548 --> 01:03:53,929
know something good should come out of

1532
01:03:51,409 --> 01:03:55,818
this I hope I think it will and I think

1533
01:03:53,929 --> 01:03:57,529
this is the beauty of what bubbleman is

1534
01:03:55,818 --> 01:03:59,570
doing here with this Pro

1535
01:03:57,530 --> 01:04:01,880
bringing a lot of people together I mean

1536
01:03:59,570 --> 01:04:03,920
I kind of feel it's weird that mark and

1537
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:06,769
I are are speaking more now over the

1538
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:08,750
show then we have you know we just live

1539
01:04:06,769 --> 01:04:09,739
a couple miles away from each other but

1540
01:04:08,750 --> 01:04:15,110
we'll make it happen

1541
01:04:09,739 --> 01:04:16,969
I'm now actually mark with you I was

1542
01:04:15,110 --> 01:04:19,700
actually talking to a bald man mark

1543
01:04:16,969 --> 01:04:22,250
Marcus and I was all like hey Marcus I

1544
01:04:19,699 --> 01:04:24,199
got this project I'm doing and I don't

1545
01:04:22,250 --> 01:04:27,460
want to promote it and he's oh like Paul

1546
01:04:24,199 --> 01:04:30,259
you know Mark from Veera protecting he's

1547
01:04:27,460 --> 01:04:32,210
he's already got that and I'm like

1548
01:04:30,260 --> 01:04:34,820
really yeah he goes he's already got

1549
01:04:32,210 --> 01:04:37,070
that okay let's find out and at that

1550
01:04:34,820 --> 01:04:39,980
time I knew your company I just didn't

1551
01:04:37,070 --> 01:04:41,390
know was a full glass air path that when

1552
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:43,400
you just set it right now this full

1553
01:04:41,389 --> 01:04:44,900
glass air path now I'm thinking I should

1554
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:46,639
go back to the drawing board again

1555
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:51,349
because I need to make it different now

1556
01:04:46,639 --> 01:04:53,389
and it is a different design we are

1557
01:04:51,349 --> 01:04:56,690
working on something that's our desktop

1558
01:04:53,389 --> 01:04:58,579
that's full glass air path but the only

1559
01:04:56,690 --> 01:05:01,099
difference I think between ours and

1560
01:04:58,579 --> 01:05:05,750
yours is you use a ceramic feeder we

1561
01:05:01,099 --> 01:05:07,940
don't and ours is designed to look like

1562
01:05:05,750 --> 01:05:11,090
a spaceship because all everything in

1563
01:05:07,940 --> 01:05:14,150
our company is named after sci-fi stuff

1564
01:05:11,090 --> 01:05:17,000
we were I'm a Star Trek fan and the

1565
01:05:14,150 --> 01:05:19,160
Futurama fan because as you can see we

1566
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:23,619
we have our deserve vaporizers named

1567
01:05:19,159 --> 01:05:26,000
Omicron Persei 8 you know and that was

1568
01:05:23,619 --> 01:05:27,859
that that idea was given to us through

1569
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:30,139
another friend that is a like a you know

1570
01:05:27,860 --> 01:05:31,579
why just if you have your Omicron once

1571
01:05:30,139 --> 01:05:34,159
you call the second one Percy and the

1572
01:05:31,579 --> 01:05:36,920
third one Nate I go well let's do it

1573
01:05:34,159 --> 01:05:39,739
since I like Futurama but after that

1574
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:41,659
after we named all our products Futurama

1575
01:05:39,739 --> 01:05:46,279
did an episode about us that you know

1576
01:05:41,659 --> 01:05:51,139
that Marcus yeah Futurama did an episode

1577
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:53,360
about as T the terrestrial that's what

1578
01:05:51,139 --> 01:05:56,839
it's called the episode I think it's

1579
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:58,400
season seven there Teta terrestrial

1580
01:05:56,840 --> 01:06:03,890
that's what it is but either way you

1581
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:06,320
know the I'm looking at going back

1582
01:06:03,889 --> 01:06:09,269
retrospectively there's a lot of

1583
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:12,900
companies that are here even

1584
01:06:09,269 --> 01:06:15,530
you showed me that Seiko the bubbler

1585
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:17,780
that you have there was a lot of talk in

1586
01:06:15,530 --> 01:06:20,160
2013-2014 with people knocking off

1587
01:06:17,780 --> 01:06:21,870
because I think you own the patent for

1588
01:06:20,159 --> 01:06:26,250
the joint on the bottom of the bubbler

1589
01:06:21,869 --> 01:06:29,369
don't you correct yeah there's a lot of

1590
01:06:26,250 --> 01:06:31,829
talk of the on the forums of people

1591
01:06:29,369 --> 01:06:33,630
knocking that off and how that's not

1592
01:06:31,829 --> 01:06:36,389
going to be you know doable and all of

1593
01:06:33,630 --> 01:06:38,059
that but either till this day you know

1594
01:06:36,389 --> 01:06:40,529
people are still knocking it off and

1595
01:06:38,059 --> 01:06:43,409
it's pretty difficult for you to go

1596
01:06:40,530 --> 01:06:45,170
after yeah I mean I I I look at the

1597
01:06:43,409 --> 01:06:49,019
patents the same way as you which is

1598
01:06:45,170 --> 01:06:50,880
kind of like nuclear nuclear bombs you

1599
01:06:49,019 --> 01:06:54,300
never use them you just threaten them

1600
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:56,490
and if people decide they're gonna play

1601
01:06:54,300 --> 01:06:59,160
chicken with you then you guys could

1602
01:06:56,489 --> 01:07:01,229
have a legal battle but the clear winner

1603
01:06:59,159 --> 01:07:03,299
is typically just the attorneys that are

1604
01:07:01,230 --> 01:07:05,820
getting paid all those billable hours

1605
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:08,550
and it is such a thing it is such a

1606
01:07:05,820 --> 01:07:10,950
tough thing that is the honorary truth

1607
01:07:08,550 --> 01:07:12,870
right there go ahead Linus I think for

1608
01:07:10,949 --> 01:07:17,129
all the work that you put into a patent

1609
01:07:12,869 --> 01:07:18,750
and we got patents too and I think for

1610
01:07:17,130 --> 01:07:20,160
all the work you put in there's some

1611
01:07:18,750 --> 01:07:23,010
good that comes out of it because it

1612
01:07:20,159 --> 01:07:24,989
deters large businesses from knocking

1613
01:07:23,010 --> 01:07:27,030
you off so you'll deal with all these

1614
01:07:24,989 --> 01:07:29,279
small things that you can't whack them

1615
01:07:27,030 --> 01:07:31,860
all or whatever and it would cost more

1616
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:33,180
money than designing new vaporizers so

1617
01:07:31,860 --> 01:07:36,090
you don't do it you know and just for

1618
01:07:33,179 --> 01:07:38,940
the the kind of the hippie ethic of it's

1619
01:07:36,090 --> 01:07:40,829
better to put money into developing your

1620
01:07:38,940 --> 01:07:43,769
next thing and staying relevant rather

1621
01:07:40,829 --> 01:07:46,559
than trying to fight people but anyway

1622
01:07:43,769 --> 01:07:49,019
it it the deterrent value I think is

1623
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:50,699
there I hope we've all been helped for

1624
01:07:49,019 --> 01:07:54,469
all of us who have spent time and money

1625
01:07:50,699 --> 01:07:58,250
on a patent and paid the lawyers so much

1626
01:07:54,469 --> 01:08:00,629
someone like volcano or a giant company

1627
01:07:58,250 --> 01:08:04,980
well maybe they would knock you off but

1628
01:08:00,630 --> 01:08:08,820
my theory is that they don't and it it

1629
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:10,980
if people with pockets won't rip you off

1630
01:08:08,820 --> 01:08:15,990
straight off when you have a good patent

1631
01:08:10,980 --> 01:08:18,270
and maybe that's prevented a lot of us

1632
01:08:15,989 --> 01:08:20,929
from being knocked off by actual serious

1633
01:08:18,270 --> 01:08:20,930
competitors

1634
01:08:22,509 --> 01:08:26,319
well you gotta understand people with

1635
01:08:24,279 --> 01:08:29,529
pockets won't knock you off but they

1636
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:31,719
will bury you in legal fees just to make

1637
01:08:29,529 --> 01:08:34,179
sure you don't your patent is

1638
01:08:31,719 --> 01:08:36,609
invalidated just look at JPMorgan Chase

1639
01:08:34,179 --> 01:08:39,368
and Tesla you know that's that's

1640
01:08:36,609 --> 01:08:42,069
basically what happened you know that he

1641
01:08:39,368 --> 01:08:46,058
made sure that Edison got the patents

1642
01:08:42,069 --> 01:08:50,369
for the four got his patents and Tesla

1643
01:08:46,059 --> 01:08:50,369
was basically invalidated after that

1644
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:59,529
dilemma yeah yeah indeed why don't I

1645
01:08:57,458 --> 01:09:01,599
think we've gotta now after Sabo to

1646
01:08:59,529 --> 01:09:02,949
Linus I just I know you kind of told

1647
01:09:01,599 --> 01:09:04,979
your story a little bit but you know

1648
01:09:02,948 --> 01:09:06,428
give us the full sort of like

1649
01:09:04,979 --> 01:09:08,739
vaporbrothers

1650
01:09:06,429 --> 01:09:10,989
but before the passion that led you to

1651
01:09:08,738 --> 01:09:14,228
want to do this and and I'll kind of get

1652
01:09:10,988 --> 01:09:15,968
deep into you know wanting the vapor

1653
01:09:14,229 --> 01:09:21,009
brothers to be the the most sold

1654
01:09:15,969 --> 01:09:23,469
vaporizer the passion that goes way back

1655
01:09:21,009 --> 01:09:29,738
the memory doesn't always go that far

1656
01:09:23,469 --> 01:09:32,019
back but I remember that it seemed like

1657
01:09:29,738 --> 01:09:35,518
pot was a good thing it seemed like

1658
01:09:32,019 --> 01:09:38,559
people around it were good people many

1659
01:09:35,519 --> 01:09:43,150
it seemed like it helped people to be

1660
01:09:38,559 --> 01:09:46,088
good people back when I learned about

1661
01:09:43,149 --> 01:09:50,248
acid that's such a time commitment and

1662
01:09:46,088 --> 01:09:53,048
it's a little scary too it seemed like

1663
01:09:50,248 --> 01:09:56,859
weed was a good substitute for it was

1664
01:09:53,048 --> 01:09:58,958
kind of a poor man's acid and now that I

1665
01:09:56,859 --> 01:10:00,488
realized how hard life is for a lot of

1666
01:09:58,958 --> 01:10:02,559
people I realized I was kind of a

1667
01:10:00,488 --> 01:10:06,908
privileged kid because I was able to go

1668
01:10:02,559 --> 01:10:09,190
college and stuff at the same time when

1669
01:10:06,908 --> 01:10:11,228
I proposed to you know my parents would

1670
01:10:09,189 --> 01:10:14,288
be pretty conservative what I wanted to

1671
01:10:11,229 --> 01:10:16,329
do in life maybe they would come back

1672
01:10:14,288 --> 01:10:20,069
with well what what's that going to do

1673
01:10:16,328 --> 01:10:22,328
good for the world and that kind of

1674
01:10:20,069 --> 01:10:23,859
invalidated a lot of things that I might

1675
01:10:22,328 --> 01:10:27,248
want to do with my life that were just

1676
01:10:23,859 --> 01:10:30,518
like fun or neat or or ego-driven or

1677
01:10:27,248 --> 01:10:33,248
something and that stuck with me and I

1678
01:10:30,519 --> 01:10:35,079
was like okay I'd better use my my tools

1679
01:10:33,248 --> 01:10:35,929
I wasn't doing that well in college I

1680
01:10:35,078 --> 01:10:38,479
was in I was like a

1681
01:10:35,930 --> 01:10:40,880
permanent student but it allowed me to

1682
01:10:38,479 --> 01:10:43,819
take a lot of different things and so I

1683
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:45,890
thought I should bring together the

1684
01:10:43,819 --> 01:10:47,569
things I've been taught from the

1685
01:10:45,890 --> 01:10:49,970
engineering or interest in physics

1686
01:10:47,569 --> 01:10:56,920
anything from computers and the world

1687
01:10:49,970 --> 01:10:59,390
history and now health of course so that

1688
01:10:56,920 --> 01:11:01,730
kind of led to me trying to make these

1689
01:10:59,390 --> 01:11:03,829
tiny bowls because I was actually kind

1690
01:11:01,729 --> 01:11:07,129
of looking for less body impact because

1691
01:11:03,829 --> 01:11:09,199
smoking really does well you smoke as

1692
01:11:07,130 --> 01:11:13,369
much as you can until your coffee if

1693
01:11:09,199 --> 01:11:16,789
you're going for that vaporization once

1694
01:11:13,369 --> 01:11:20,300
we discovered our way to do it was

1695
01:11:16,789 --> 01:11:22,220
really well less body impact doesn't

1696
01:11:20,300 --> 01:11:27,020
just mean you vaporize and feel better

1697
01:11:22,220 --> 01:11:31,730
but you can vaporize more and feel bit

1698
01:11:27,020 --> 01:11:34,670
fine and as soon as marijuana started

1699
01:11:31,729 --> 01:11:36,109
becoming clear medicine this isn't just

1700
01:11:34,670 --> 01:11:37,520
recreational this isn't just for fun

1701
01:11:36,109 --> 01:11:39,939
these aren't just kids trying to get

1702
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:43,160
high and and you know call it medicine

1703
01:11:39,939 --> 01:11:48,759
there are actual patients needing it it

1704
01:11:43,159 --> 01:11:51,859
became an important thing and kind of a

1705
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:56,230
kind of a coincidence with us wanted to

1706
01:11:51,859 --> 01:11:58,670
impress smokers our device was great for

1707
01:11:56,229 --> 01:12:00,909
taking of medicine because it created

1708
01:11:58,670 --> 01:12:05,949
some high temperatures that we believe

1709
01:12:00,909 --> 01:12:08,439
brings out converts the THC into very

1710
01:12:05,949 --> 01:12:11,090
pain relieving components actually I'm

1711
01:12:08,439 --> 01:12:13,699
stating that wrong but the higher

1712
01:12:11,090 --> 01:12:15,380
temperatures that we were getting on

1713
01:12:13,699 --> 01:12:17,359
this which is basically you're riding

1714
01:12:15,380 --> 01:12:20,239
the fine line between vaporizing and

1715
01:12:17,359 --> 01:12:23,089
smoking we're not a pure vaporizer

1716
01:12:20,239 --> 01:12:25,069
unless you turn it down but it's normal

1717
01:12:23,090 --> 01:12:26,930
setting when you're drawing it you're

1718
01:12:25,069 --> 01:12:28,609
kind of riding this fine line between

1719
01:12:26,930 --> 01:12:33,350
getting it too hot and not hot enough

1720
01:12:28,609 --> 01:12:35,059
and at that point you're impressing the

1721
01:12:33,350 --> 01:12:36,620
smokers because I think you're creating

1722
01:12:35,060 --> 01:12:42,160
a lot of the same components that they

1723
01:12:36,619 --> 01:12:47,699
are used to kind of that quick effect

1724
01:12:42,159 --> 01:12:50,699
plus the body effect to it but

1725
01:12:47,699 --> 01:12:52,500
moving ahead I was also as I mentioned

1726
01:12:50,699 --> 01:12:54,539
before I was trying to cut down I also

1727
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:56,310
wanted to be a better student and it

1728
01:12:54,539 --> 01:12:59,189
wasn't helping it was helping with

1729
01:12:56,310 --> 01:13:02,670
creativity but math not not so good and

1730
01:12:59,189 --> 01:13:07,199
I wasn't that great at math so but my

1731
01:13:02,670 --> 01:13:10,140
attempts to cut down created this kind

1732
01:13:07,199 --> 01:13:14,880
of stronger more efficient alternative

1733
01:13:10,140 --> 01:13:17,280
and I never felt like people quitting

1734
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:19,350
cold turkey anything is a great thing

1735
01:13:17,279 --> 01:13:24,179
because the thing is not necessarily bad

1736
01:13:19,350 --> 01:13:26,700
they just want to cut it down and so to

1737
01:13:24,180 --> 01:13:28,500
cut something down it's nice to find

1738
01:13:26,699 --> 01:13:31,139
something that is stronger in its own

1739
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:35,239
way and so vapor became that stronger

1740
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:38,220
alternative and some people were

1741
01:13:35,239 --> 01:13:41,429
surprised to know that we still smoked

1742
01:13:38,220 --> 01:13:42,510
but whatever do both that's one thing

1743
01:13:41,430 --> 01:13:44,730
that we told people who were not

1744
01:13:42,510 --> 01:13:46,230
impressed by vapor overly the vapors not

1745
01:13:44,729 --> 01:13:49,109
doing it that much for you sure you want

1746
01:13:46,229 --> 01:13:50,909
to smoke smoke also and they they got an

1747
01:13:49,109 --> 01:13:54,569
effect that was way beyond what they

1748
01:13:50,909 --> 01:13:56,159
could have if they had just smoke and

1749
01:13:54,569 --> 01:13:57,719
some of those people went to vapor or

1750
01:13:56,159 --> 01:13:59,789
full-time we started getting reports

1751
01:13:57,720 --> 01:14:02,490
back from people that had changed their

1752
01:13:59,789 --> 01:14:06,479
life or saved their life this thing

1753
01:14:02,489 --> 01:14:09,869
about less body impact also allows

1754
01:14:06,479 --> 01:14:11,519
people as I said to smoke more and for

1755
01:14:09,869 --> 01:14:13,019
some people who really need the medicine

1756
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:15,240
like some people were simply depressed

1757
01:14:13,020 --> 01:14:18,230
and marijuana would make them less

1758
01:14:15,239 --> 01:14:20,909
depressed and with that little kind of

1759
01:14:18,229 --> 01:14:23,219
substitute for acid effect it kind of

1760
01:14:20,909 --> 01:14:25,380
would help them come into a more perfect

1761
01:14:23,220 --> 01:14:30,090
like personhood like you can think

1762
01:14:25,380 --> 01:14:32,430
certain things through and you can get

1763
01:14:30,090 --> 01:14:35,489
somewhere sometimes in your mind on it

1764
01:14:32,430 --> 01:14:38,850
and then with these people able to take

1765
01:14:35,489 --> 01:14:40,319
more they couldn't take enough smoking

1766
01:14:38,850 --> 01:14:42,329
their lungs were done some people were a

1767
01:14:40,319 --> 01:14:44,340
lot older than us and we're like I can't

1768
01:14:42,329 --> 01:14:46,350
smoke on I haven't smoked in years but

1769
01:14:44,340 --> 01:14:48,750
with your vaporizer I do it every day

1770
01:14:46,350 --> 01:14:50,820
and this thing has saved my life once we

1771
01:14:48,750 --> 01:14:52,649
hear that a few times we realize we're

1772
01:14:50,819 --> 01:14:58,019
on to we need to do this and it's good

1773
01:14:52,649 --> 01:15:00,119
for the world but uh yeah there's so

1774
01:14:58,020 --> 01:15:01,500
many things I could get into there I

1775
01:15:00,119 --> 01:15:04,019
mean there were a lot of people

1776
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:05,489
who helped us along the way and who

1777
01:15:04,020 --> 01:15:08,220
really became the vaporbrothers

1778
01:15:05,489 --> 01:15:12,029
vaporbrothers is not just two brothers I

1779
01:15:08,220 --> 01:15:17,250
have a brother but my partners were like

1780
01:15:12,029 --> 01:15:19,500
our bros and a lot of some people well

1781
01:15:17,250 --> 01:15:22,619
for us to start spreading faster we

1782
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:24,899
lived in Venice at the time we wanted to

1783
01:15:22,619 --> 01:15:26,369
get to woody harrelson as fast as

1784
01:15:24,899 --> 01:15:28,889
possible because he had helped another

1785
01:15:26,369 --> 01:15:30,840
hemp company called Hempstead they were

1786
01:15:28,890 --> 01:15:32,850
the first like really good-looking hemp

1787
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:35,190
clothes in LA you could be fashionable

1788
01:15:32,850 --> 01:15:38,610
and wear hemp it wasn't all like rough

1789
01:15:35,189 --> 01:15:41,819
this isn't him and partly done it this

1790
01:15:38,609 --> 01:15:44,519
is though they weren't just like rough

1791
01:15:41,819 --> 01:15:46,500
and bubbly that was kind of shiny and

1792
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:48,840
and finally made fabric and whatever

1793
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:50,399
that kind of blew up and made would he

1794
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:53,039
not want to invest in companies anymore

1795
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:56,869
but through his friends who actually

1796
01:15:53,039 --> 01:16:01,769
took our company and made it into a

1797
01:15:56,869 --> 01:16:04,079
thing they were so into it this one guy

1798
01:16:01,770 --> 01:16:06,560
his name now is hippie Steve and another

1799
01:16:04,079 --> 01:16:11,189
guy named dr. D dr. Richard Deandra in

1800
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:13,170
D'Andrea they hosted me they hosted the

1801
01:16:11,189 --> 01:16:15,659
vaporizer and they introduced it to

1802
01:16:13,170 --> 01:16:20,100
everybody who came through and one of

1803
01:16:15,659 --> 01:16:22,859
these guys had a music studio in the

1804
01:16:20,100 --> 01:16:26,520
back he used to he called it smoking

1805
01:16:22,859 --> 01:16:28,199
totes his his band he is to do something

1806
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:29,760
similar to smoking totes I hope they

1807
01:16:28,199 --> 01:16:31,349
weren't actually harvesting from toads

1808
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:33,119
but they would make music to go along

1809
01:16:31,350 --> 01:16:35,039
with that and you could listen to this

1810
01:16:33,119 --> 01:16:37,439
music when you did DMT and it was like

1811
01:16:35,039 --> 01:16:41,970
you can't really listen to normal

1812
01:16:37,439 --> 01:16:45,539
contrived radio friendly music or going

1813
01:16:41,970 --> 01:16:46,890
on such a trip he vaporized everybody

1814
01:16:45,539 --> 01:16:48,810
who came through there there were people

1815
01:16:46,890 --> 01:16:50,400
recording their jazz bands they were

1816
01:16:48,810 --> 01:16:52,380
like oh we only smoke joints well and

1817
01:16:50,399 --> 01:16:56,789
smoke bombs and he'd like well try this

1818
01:16:52,380 --> 01:16:59,810
and they were converted basically and it

1819
01:16:56,789 --> 01:17:04,399
was helping them we also we were very

1820
01:16:59,810 --> 01:17:09,480
kind of hippie-dippie like wanting to

1821
01:17:04,399 --> 01:17:14,429
reject the world of toxins toxic food

1822
01:17:09,479 --> 01:17:15,178
was extremely popular things like

1823
01:17:14,430 --> 01:17:18,390
vegetarians

1824
01:17:15,179 --> 01:17:21,029
we're just becoming really palatable and

1825
01:17:18,390 --> 01:17:25,980
good and thick and heavy and greasy and

1826
01:17:21,029 --> 01:17:27,899
and lovable and we hope to do that with

1827
01:17:25,979 --> 01:17:30,119
vapor turn it from something that might

1828
01:17:27,899 --> 01:17:31,559
be a little too light or stale or have

1829
01:17:30,119 --> 01:17:36,269
other reasons why people would not want

1830
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:37,620
to do it let me fast-forward again we

1831
01:17:36,270 --> 01:17:41,159
also wanted to make a device that was

1832
01:17:37,619 --> 01:17:43,948
very simple with this this toxic world

1833
01:17:41,158 --> 01:17:45,569
thing we wanted to get all the toxins

1834
01:17:43,948 --> 01:17:48,178
out of the vaporizer and with me knowing

1835
01:17:45,569 --> 01:17:49,738
that our formula was a very hot heating

1836
01:17:48,179 --> 01:17:51,239
element inside it's it's almost a

1837
01:17:49,738 --> 01:17:56,069
thousand degrees on the surface of the

1838
01:17:51,238 --> 01:17:57,928
heater it has to be that way to heat the

1839
01:17:56,069 --> 01:17:59,969
air quickly and give you the four

1840
01:17:57,929 --> 01:18:01,319
hundred three hundred degrees air that

1841
01:17:59,969 --> 01:18:05,489
you need to flow through the herb and

1842
01:18:01,319 --> 01:18:07,859
vaporize the herb just right something

1843
01:18:05,488 --> 01:18:11,039
that hot is going to smell and when it

1844
01:18:07,859 --> 01:18:13,229
smells you're inhaling particles of that

1845
01:18:11,039 --> 01:18:15,060
thing so if it's a hot heating element

1846
01:18:13,229 --> 01:18:17,549
you you smell hot metal you're smelling

1847
01:18:15,060 --> 01:18:20,460
a little bit of hot hot ions so that's

1848
01:18:17,550 --> 01:18:22,739
why we convert it over to ceramic as

1849
01:18:20,460 --> 01:18:24,779
soon as we could hot ceramic smells like

1850
01:18:22,738 --> 01:18:27,689
hot stone it's there there's barely

1851
01:18:24,779 --> 01:18:31,289
anything in it ceramic can handle what

1852
01:18:27,689 --> 01:18:33,359
three thousand degrees before melting or

1853
01:18:31,289 --> 01:18:36,119
breaking down and this sits here at

1854
01:18:33,359 --> 01:18:38,210
1,000 so that was very safe for us

1855
01:18:36,119 --> 01:18:40,439
there's glass around it at the bottom is

1856
01:18:38,210 --> 01:18:42,840
medical grade silicone which can handle

1857
01:18:40,439 --> 01:18:45,839
the the 400 degrees that it needs to

1858
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:47,730
touch everything in the box is meant to

1859
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:49,529
more than handle what temperature it

1860
01:18:47,729 --> 01:18:55,019
gets to even if the box is upside down

1861
01:18:49,529 --> 01:18:57,779
and and the air vents are blocked it the

1862
01:18:55,020 --> 01:18:59,850
point was we didn't want people inhaling

1863
01:18:57,779 --> 01:19:02,250
parts of the vaporizer and a lot of

1864
01:18:59,850 --> 01:19:05,579
vapor ice can do that I know with Marc's

1865
01:19:02,250 --> 01:19:08,640
vaporizers he used the best heating heat

1866
01:19:05,579 --> 01:19:11,729
guns that he could get the Stine L with

1867
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:14,760
when Sabo came came along one of the

1868
01:19:11,729 --> 01:19:18,479
things that stuck with me when Sabo gave

1869
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:21,030
us some advice once was that he was

1870
01:19:18,479 --> 01:19:23,549
wanting to position his vaporizers like

1871
01:19:21,029 --> 01:19:25,319
the iPhone of vaporizers and with the

1872
01:19:23,550 --> 01:19:26,940
all glass air path all the way through

1873
01:19:25,319 --> 01:19:28,920
to where the air is inhaled into the

1874
01:19:26,939 --> 01:19:31,319
vaporizer it stays within

1875
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:33,239
glass and never picks up anything our

1876
01:19:31,319 --> 01:19:35,609
vaporizer inhales from kind of the

1877
01:19:33,238 --> 01:19:38,459
inside in the bottom but what we did to

1878
01:19:35,609 --> 01:19:44,429
every part in the ball is to remake it

1879
01:19:38,460 --> 01:19:46,890
to be knock exhaling smell when it gets

1880
01:19:44,429 --> 01:19:51,179
warm we would even redesign the LED

1881
01:19:46,890 --> 01:19:54,030
board the controller board to be correct

1882
01:19:51,179 --> 01:19:56,100
no parts get hot that's what makes cheap

1883
01:19:54,029 --> 01:19:57,689
devices to by the way cheap devices when

1884
01:19:56,100 --> 01:19:59,250
they put it in they don't do all the

1885
01:19:57,689 --> 01:20:02,159
work to make sure that every component

1886
01:19:59,250 --> 01:20:03,779
doesn't overload itself some resistors

1887
01:20:02,159 --> 01:20:05,939
can get hot and start smelling like

1888
01:20:03,779 --> 01:20:08,639
burnt plastic and that's just the smell

1889
01:20:05,939 --> 01:20:12,139
of Chinese stuff sometimes but what we

1890
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:15,300
did was try to let free solder all the

1891
01:20:12,140 --> 01:20:17,610
stuff that we wanted to do to assure

1892
01:20:15,300 --> 01:20:21,570
ourselves that we could inhale from this

1893
01:20:17,609 --> 01:20:24,960
thing the rest of our lives and and not

1894
01:20:21,569 --> 01:20:26,579
have trouble we also inhaled air into

1895
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:29,250
vacuum cylinders that were sent to

1896
01:20:26,579 --> 01:20:33,539
industrial hygiene labs which would test

1897
01:20:29,250 --> 01:20:36,448
the the vapor or test the whatever might

1898
01:20:33,539 --> 01:20:38,010
be coming off the vaporizer and so we

1899
01:20:36,448 --> 01:20:39,689
made sure that we got it good to wear

1900
01:20:38,010 --> 01:20:42,659
our vaporizer was safer than just

1901
01:20:39,689 --> 01:20:44,069
inhaling air like in your office and by

1902
01:20:42,659 --> 01:20:46,579
the way the air in your house and in

1903
01:20:44,069 --> 01:20:49,049
your office is not that not that great

1904
01:20:46,579 --> 01:20:53,429
especially after your your laser printer

1905
01:20:49,050 --> 01:20:55,560
has printed a paper another thing people

1906
01:20:53,429 --> 01:20:57,329
are very worried about metal ions the

1907
01:20:55,560 --> 01:21:00,690
industry doesn't know about metal ions

1908
01:20:57,329 --> 01:21:02,880
like the the the whole manufacturing

1909
01:21:00,689 --> 01:21:05,669
world around there doesn't care if the

1910
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:07,800
material is not melting they think it's

1911
01:21:05,670 --> 01:21:09,480
great and something that could be really

1912
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:14,820
hot could smell like metal and you're

1913
01:21:09,479 --> 01:21:16,859
inhaling those metal ions we got rid of

1914
01:21:14,819 --> 01:21:19,229
the metal but while we still have the

1915
01:21:16,859 --> 01:21:19,589
metal we had to realize we just simplify

1916
01:21:19,229 --> 01:21:22,529
it

1917
01:21:19,590 --> 01:21:24,360
don't pick like what up tech mentioned

1918
01:21:22,529 --> 01:21:27,029
stainless steel you don't want chromium

1919
01:21:24,359 --> 01:21:30,869
coming off of it

1920
01:21:27,029 --> 01:21:33,389
pick simple materials like iron and and

1921
01:21:30,869 --> 01:21:35,789
the nichrome wire that we had to have

1922
01:21:33,390 --> 01:21:38,039
that that that could off gas something

1923
01:21:35,789 --> 01:21:42,329
but make it small but what I realized

1924
01:21:38,039 --> 01:21:45,479
was your kitchen has

1925
01:21:42,329 --> 01:21:47,250
an electric range that has almost the

1926
01:21:45,479 --> 01:21:49,259
same materials running at almost the

1927
01:21:47,250 --> 01:21:52,920
same temperature at a much larger scale

1928
01:21:49,260 --> 01:21:55,320
and you're inhaling that forever so you

1929
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:56,730
can't make anything like just perfect

1930
01:21:55,319 --> 01:21:58,859
we're always going to inhale something

1931
01:21:56,729 --> 01:22:01,199
but our point was to make it much better

1932
01:21:58,859 --> 01:22:01,619
than what you're inhaling every single

1933
01:22:01,199 --> 01:22:04,559
day

1934
01:22:01,619 --> 01:22:06,899
I think the point line is you're done

1935
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:09,750
yours is we want to reduce what we're

1936
01:22:06,899 --> 01:22:12,479
the amounts were inhaling we don't want

1937
01:22:09,750 --> 01:22:14,460
to make it more with a you know by

1938
01:22:12,479 --> 01:22:16,199
adding a box vaporizer by adding any

1939
01:22:14,460 --> 01:22:18,119
type of a browser we don't want to

1940
01:22:16,199 --> 01:22:20,970
increase that we want to reduce it

1941
01:22:18,119 --> 01:22:22,380
forward basically most some of us

1942
01:22:20,970 --> 01:22:25,470
actually trying to reduce our carbon

1943
01:22:22,380 --> 01:22:27,659
carbon footprint so that I think that's

1944
01:22:25,470 --> 01:22:30,000
what you're trying to say correct yes

1945
01:22:27,659 --> 01:22:31,920
exactly and you know what call it a harm

1946
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:33,899
reduction device from the very beginning

1947
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:36,239
vaporizers have been haven't they been

1948
01:22:33,899 --> 01:22:38,670
called harm reduction devices like Mark

1949
01:22:36,239 --> 01:22:40,199
did you use that term absolutely I mean

1950
01:22:38,670 --> 01:22:42,480
it's it's through all three of our

1951
01:22:40,199 --> 01:22:45,119
utility patents we push the concept of

1952
01:22:42,479 --> 01:22:48,029
harm reduction for smoking of any

1953
01:22:45,119 --> 01:22:51,599
botannical not just cannabis but yeah I

1954
01:22:48,029 --> 01:22:53,279
mean what you said in the middle of -

1955
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:56,520
really I think will stick with me I

1956
01:22:53,279 --> 01:22:59,729
think is a good way for for the the

1957
01:22:56,520 --> 01:23:01,530
viewers to think about it don't vaporize

1958
01:22:59,729 --> 01:23:03,989
your vaporizer and if you're using a

1959
01:23:01,529 --> 01:23:06,509
vaporizer that requires you to vaporize

1960
01:23:03,989 --> 01:23:08,519
your vaporizer even just trace amounts

1961
01:23:06,510 --> 01:23:10,739
of it's probably not the best vaporizer

1962
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:14,540
for you yeah

1963
01:23:10,739 --> 01:23:18,090
and a harm reduction device is good term

1964
01:23:14,539 --> 01:23:20,010
because especially with a cigarette I'm

1965
01:23:18,090 --> 01:23:22,110
gonna just sidestep over two actually

1966
01:23:20,010 --> 01:23:24,869
cigarettes with juice propylene glycol

1967
01:23:22,109 --> 01:23:26,250
sounds horrible all the stuff that's in

1968
01:23:24,869 --> 01:23:28,590
them whatever it's a harm reduction

1969
01:23:26,250 --> 01:23:29,729
device you vape a bunch of these

1970
01:23:28,590 --> 01:23:32,489
cigarettes you're gonna live a whole lot

1971
01:23:29,729 --> 01:23:36,239
longer than if you burn cigarettes into

1972
01:23:32,489 --> 01:23:39,090
your lungs so with with harm reduction

1973
01:23:36,239 --> 01:23:41,729
devices it's not like there's zero harm

1974
01:23:39,090 --> 01:23:43,739
you're inhaling a moisture into your

1975
01:23:41,729 --> 01:23:45,239
lungs I don't know what lungs are meant

1976
01:23:43,739 --> 01:23:47,849
to take in but I don't know if they

1977
01:23:45,239 --> 01:23:51,630
evolved to inhale a whole bunch of of

1978
01:23:47,850 --> 01:23:52,770
particles and and and moisture but it is

1979
01:23:51,630 --> 01:23:54,690
so much better

1980
01:23:52,770 --> 01:23:56,460
it's hard with you know I don't know if

1981
01:23:54,689 --> 01:23:58,738
it's just Americans but we're very

1982
01:23:56,460 --> 01:24:01,198
all one way or the other way oh my god a

1983
01:23:58,738 --> 01:24:02,609
little bit of right now they're finding

1984
01:24:01,198 --> 01:24:04,738
out actually this is a whole nother

1985
01:24:02,609 --> 01:24:07,529
conversation they're finding out that

1986
01:24:04,738 --> 01:24:08,759
this little bit of benzene in marijuana

1987
01:24:07,529 --> 01:24:10,170
when it's cooked

1988
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:12,119
especially at very very high

1989
01:24:10,170 --> 01:24:14,699
temperatures it's like a being on a very

1990
01:24:12,118 --> 01:24:17,158
very hot surface they're finding that

1991
01:24:14,698 --> 01:24:19,799
and but they're finding is less than

1992
01:24:17,158 --> 01:24:21,509
what you're inhaling all the time and

1993
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:23,070
some people like oh my god I need to

1994
01:24:21,510 --> 01:24:26,219
stop and what are you gonna do go to

1995
01:24:23,069 --> 01:24:32,488
things that have more you know harm or

1996
01:24:26,219 --> 01:24:33,929
whatever but um I'd like to wrap up just

1997
01:24:32,488 --> 01:24:38,669
a few thoughts of where we were going

1998
01:24:33,929 --> 01:24:41,059
with this though the not tasting your

1999
01:24:38,670 --> 01:24:44,069
vaporizer there's a lot of practical

2000
01:24:41,059 --> 01:24:48,420
implications for that for one thing with

2001
01:24:44,069 --> 01:24:51,299
vaporizing you taste what you got purely

2002
01:24:48,420 --> 01:24:53,880
someone who produces material can use a

2003
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:55,710
vaporizer to test how pure their

2004
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:57,479
material is just by their taste buds

2005
01:24:55,710 --> 01:25:00,779
I mean your your your tasting your smell

2006
01:24:57,479 --> 01:25:03,749
can tell a lot of things that it even

2007
01:25:00,779 --> 01:25:05,009
takes test equipment to find out you

2008
01:25:03,748 --> 01:25:08,359
know the odor threshold certain

2009
01:25:05,010 --> 01:25:11,400
chemicals above the odor threshold are

2010
01:25:08,359 --> 01:25:13,558
well sorry I going circles sometimes

2011
01:25:11,399 --> 01:25:16,768
though I think you said something very

2012
01:25:13,559 --> 01:25:21,630
accurate there yeah the other practical

2013
01:25:16,769 --> 01:25:24,960
thing was this is getting back to the

2014
01:25:21,630 --> 01:25:27,659
well reliability of it and not inhaling

2015
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:29,519
things we with not the biggest budget

2016
01:25:27,658 --> 01:25:31,529
ever we got a little bit of help from

2017
01:25:29,519 --> 01:25:35,010
Woody Harrelson's friend not from him

2018
01:25:31,529 --> 01:25:38,460
well little from him but more like the

2019
01:25:35,010 --> 01:25:40,679
heart help with not a lot of money to

2020
01:25:38,460 --> 01:25:43,109
make this thing work better we needed to

2021
01:25:40,679 --> 01:25:45,929
simplify it and we just have less parts

2022
01:25:43,109 --> 01:25:50,698
in it and simplifying it also meant no

2023
01:25:45,929 --> 01:25:52,769
fan no reliance on flowing air in this I

2024
01:25:50,698 --> 01:25:54,928
really respect the companies who do have

2025
01:25:52,769 --> 01:25:57,929
good electronics temperature controls

2026
01:25:54,929 --> 01:25:59,460
fans and things they really hold the

2027
01:25:57,929 --> 01:26:01,319
temperature right there where they say

2028
01:25:59,460 --> 01:26:05,429
they do this thing has no temperature

2029
01:26:01,319 --> 01:26:07,948
readout we just evolved our method to

2030
01:26:05,429 --> 01:26:10,078
not need it and what's really nice about

2031
01:26:07,948 --> 01:26:13,948
this device in the middle of the night

2032
01:26:10,078 --> 01:26:15,658
like at 1:00 a.m. and I'm not all into

2033
01:26:13,948 --> 01:26:17,788
acid or anything but just to bring back

2034
01:26:15,658 --> 01:26:19,408
that story let's say everybody is on

2035
01:26:17,788 --> 01:26:20,938
mushrooms or something in the house and

2036
01:26:19,408 --> 01:26:23,668
we're all kind of weird and it's it's

2037
01:26:20,939 --> 01:26:25,050
finally kind of gotten to its place and

2038
01:26:23,668 --> 01:26:27,628
people are kind of going deeper and

2039
01:26:25,050 --> 01:26:29,639
someone realizes they want to vaporize

2040
01:26:27,628 --> 01:26:32,868
you know smoke or oh no that's vaporize

2041
01:26:29,639 --> 01:26:34,918
hey pull out your thing we we had a

2042
01:26:32,868 --> 01:26:39,538
volcano actually I very much respect

2043
01:26:34,918 --> 01:26:41,729
volcano for being um it a lot I'm member

2044
01:26:39,538 --> 01:26:44,398
one anyway we had a volcano no vapor

2045
01:26:41,729 --> 01:26:46,949
brothers on the bar in this guy's house

2046
01:26:44,399 --> 01:26:50,820
and just the thought of turning the

2047
01:26:46,948 --> 01:26:56,088
volcano on in the middle of the night a

2048
01:26:50,819 --> 01:26:56,088
complete crackle II you know back

2049
01:26:56,208 --> 01:27:01,648
everybody use this because the only

2050
01:26:59,309 --> 01:27:03,300
sound it makes is the the correct

2051
01:27:01,649 --> 01:27:05,189
whistle that you should hear when you're

2052
01:27:03,300 --> 01:27:08,248
pulling the air at the right speed it's

2053
01:27:05,189 --> 01:27:10,979
psychedelic friendly you know yeah I

2054
01:27:08,248 --> 01:27:14,969
mean yeah and it's something you did and

2055
01:27:10,979 --> 01:27:17,519
the thing is absolutely quiet and that

2056
01:27:14,969 --> 01:27:18,809
became part of it and that also I think

2057
01:27:17,519 --> 01:27:21,449
helped it get into a lot of people's

2058
01:27:18,809 --> 01:27:23,939
houses because people were not ready to

2059
01:27:21,448 --> 01:27:25,858
have anything that they would call

2060
01:27:23,939 --> 01:27:27,570
paraphernalia being out in the open

2061
01:27:25,859 --> 01:27:30,329
especially when their parents came home

2062
01:27:27,569 --> 01:27:35,578
or friends came over or or something it

2063
01:27:30,328 --> 01:27:36,958
was kind of scary to have this so we

2064
01:27:35,578 --> 01:27:39,179
tried to make it very beautiful so they

2065
01:27:36,958 --> 01:27:40,679
could stay on their counter and not look

2066
01:27:39,179 --> 01:27:42,899
like anything this thing actually rode

2067
01:27:40,679 --> 01:27:45,719
around in the automobile and no one

2068
01:27:42,899 --> 01:27:48,209
would even want someone actually broke

2069
01:27:45,719 --> 01:27:51,838
into a car to steal one we're pretty

2070
01:27:48,208 --> 01:27:53,729
proud of that but uh for a long time no

2071
01:27:51,838 --> 01:27:59,668
one recognized this as anything else a

2072
01:27:53,729 --> 01:28:01,769
pencil sharpener but yet bait that

2073
01:27:59,668 --> 01:28:04,050
that's a good beginner of like how we

2074
01:28:01,769 --> 01:28:06,869
how we spread eventually we became okay

2075
01:28:04,050 --> 01:28:08,998
we need to become a company and we

2076
01:28:06,868 --> 01:28:11,429
became a corporation you know and

2077
01:28:08,998 --> 01:28:13,648
corporate izing caused me to have to

2078
01:28:11,429 --> 01:28:16,168
split up with my main partner which

2079
01:28:13,649 --> 01:28:18,749
really sucked he was a co-owner and I

2080
01:28:16,168 --> 01:28:21,838
had to buy a mountain and that that

2081
01:28:18,748 --> 01:28:23,939
sucked heavy but he couldn't hang with

2082
01:28:21,838 --> 01:28:25,649
the corporate culture and a lot of

2083
01:28:23,939 --> 01:28:30,000
corporations have to do is totally

2084
01:28:25,649 --> 01:28:34,289
antithetical stat the right word to a

2085
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:38,760
lot of our kind of hippie ethics but we

2086
01:28:34,289 --> 01:28:40,649
continued with ethics as being our

2087
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:42,690
strong suit also without a lot of money

2088
01:28:40,649 --> 01:28:44,460
if you're a good person and you're

2089
01:28:42,689 --> 01:28:47,069
ethical and you're helping people you

2090
01:28:44,460 --> 01:28:48,930
spread you don't need money to do it we

2091
01:28:47,069 --> 01:28:50,909
never spent money on marketing we

2092
01:28:48,930 --> 01:28:54,000
eventually figured out how to do ads and

2093
01:28:50,909 --> 01:28:56,519
they were always so so odd but you had

2094
01:28:54,000 --> 01:29:00,390
to do it to get out to to stores and to

2095
01:28:56,520 --> 01:29:02,760
go to the the trade shows and stuff but

2096
01:29:00,390 --> 01:29:04,590
really we rode on trying to be good

2097
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:07,739
people have good product keep improving

2098
01:29:04,590 --> 01:29:12,090
it and not do the things that seemed

2099
01:29:07,738 --> 01:29:13,259
wrong to us and that's basically where

2100
01:29:12,090 --> 01:29:15,180
we still are though

2101
01:29:13,260 --> 01:29:17,100
I'm actually really it's awesome just

2102
01:29:15,180 --> 01:29:21,090
someone new came on it's awesome to see

2103
01:29:17,100 --> 01:29:24,930
all five now six of us oh man you really

2104
01:29:21,090 --> 01:29:26,340
got the the innovators here yeah I try

2105
01:29:24,930 --> 01:29:28,230
to put that you know once I built the

2106
01:29:26,340 --> 01:29:30,000
traction of the channel it was kind of

2107
01:29:28,229 --> 01:29:31,919
like oh what should I do with the

2108
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:34,170
traction of this channel should I turn

2109
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:36,090
my channel into a cheesy bubble bag

2110
01:29:34,170 --> 01:29:38,850
advertisement center where I just sell

2111
01:29:36,090 --> 01:29:40,829
all my products shamelessly or do I

2112
01:29:38,850 --> 01:29:42,930
invite all the other innovators that I

2113
01:29:40,829 --> 01:29:45,059
know that are some of them many of them

2114
01:29:42,930 --> 01:29:46,949
are even more inspiring than the things

2115
01:29:45,060 --> 01:29:49,739
I've done and sort of share that

2116
01:29:46,948 --> 01:29:51,899
traction and then have them help grow it

2117
01:29:49,738 --> 01:29:53,729
and build it even more it brings us

2118
01:29:51,899 --> 01:29:58,049
thanks for sharing Linus that was great

2119
01:29:53,729 --> 01:30:01,619
story I just really important not just

2120
01:29:58,050 --> 01:30:03,750
to us but I think for the the movement

2121
01:30:01,619 --> 01:30:05,579
because even all those knockoffs they

2122
01:30:03,750 --> 01:30:09,960
still rely on us to come up with stuff

2123
01:30:05,579 --> 01:30:12,149
we create we all here created an

2124
01:30:09,960 --> 01:30:14,069
industry that they see as money and

2125
01:30:12,149 --> 01:30:16,229
they're raising their kids on it and our

2126
01:30:14,069 --> 01:30:20,219
employees raised a bunch of kids you

2127
01:30:16,229 --> 01:30:27,169
know and and they do even though

2128
01:30:20,219 --> 01:30:30,779
knockoffs seem like like a pest they

2129
01:30:27,170 --> 01:30:31,949
aren't gonna keep going and vaporizing

2130
01:30:30,779 --> 01:30:33,869
is not going to keep going unless

2131
01:30:31,948 --> 01:30:36,689
innovators like us keep trying to do

2132
01:30:33,869 --> 01:30:37,119
what we do that's it it just pushes you

2133
01:30:36,689 --> 01:30:38,769
to

2134
01:30:37,119 --> 01:30:41,289
to go to the next level and it's perfect

2135
01:30:38,770 --> 01:30:43,120
timing because it brings us to tasks who

2136
01:30:41,289 --> 01:30:45,279
just came into the room welcome dude

2137
01:30:43,119 --> 01:30:48,670
totally stoked to have you here I was

2138
01:30:45,279 --> 01:30:51,789
you know I just only have seven days to

2139
01:30:48,670 --> 01:30:53,529
organize and curate this show for each

2140
01:30:51,789 --> 01:30:55,390
week it's like Sunday's over and then

2141
01:30:53,529 --> 01:30:57,340
tomorrow Monday I'm like I got seven

2142
01:30:55,390 --> 01:30:58,780
days before I got to have the next show

2143
01:30:57,340 --> 01:31:00,460
ready so I'm sorry I didn't put the

2144
01:30:58,779 --> 01:31:02,050
invitation out earlier to you but I

2145
01:31:00,460 --> 01:31:04,569
think that you know one of the things

2146
01:31:02,050 --> 01:31:06,610
that task did with the electric nail and

2147
01:31:04,569 --> 01:31:09,670
the highly-educated products is you

2148
01:31:06,609 --> 01:31:11,799
really took this whole like vaporization

2149
01:31:09,670 --> 01:31:15,100
thing made it even more made it the

2150
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:17,560
ultimate for convenience for for the

2151
01:31:15,100 --> 01:31:19,210
dabbing world and I mean maybe even was

2152
01:31:17,560 --> 01:31:21,010
I don't know I you're gonna share your

2153
01:31:19,210 --> 01:31:23,770
history right now with us once I shut my

2154
01:31:21,010 --> 01:31:25,480
mouth but I'm not sure if like it was

2155
01:31:23,770 --> 01:31:27,640
even the start of the dabbing culture

2156
01:31:25,479 --> 01:31:29,409
obviously we were doing hot knives and

2157
01:31:27,640 --> 01:31:32,770
the mayor existed for doing the hot

2158
01:31:29,409 --> 01:31:34,689
spoon dabs but dabbing really dabbing

2159
01:31:32,770 --> 01:31:37,390
like heating up a dish with the electric

2160
01:31:34,689 --> 01:31:38,889
nail like that pretty much coincided

2161
01:31:37,390 --> 01:31:39,310
with the release of your product that it

2162
01:31:38,890 --> 01:31:42,940
not

2163
01:31:39,310 --> 01:31:44,590
oh you're muted sorry I can't unmute you

2164
01:31:42,939 --> 01:31:47,229
got to push the mute button on your

2165
01:31:44,590 --> 01:31:48,819
screen there I mute everyone's there you

2166
01:31:47,229 --> 01:31:50,949
go perfect

2167
01:31:48,819 --> 01:31:52,869
I can hear you perfect good all right

2168
01:31:50,949 --> 01:31:56,319
well first off don't worry about the

2169
01:31:52,869 --> 01:31:58,180
late imitation I always say if you wait

2170
01:31:56,319 --> 01:32:01,090
until the last minute it only takes a

2171
01:31:58,180 --> 01:32:05,170
minute though we're all good on that but

2172
01:32:01,090 --> 01:32:08,470
uh as far as highly-educated goes you

2173
01:32:05,170 --> 01:32:11,590
know there were nails before we started

2174
01:32:08,470 --> 01:32:14,560
in fact look you talked about building

2175
01:32:11,590 --> 01:32:17,220
on the shoulders of giants I have just

2176
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:21,490
purchased my first titanium nail back in

2177
01:32:17,220 --> 01:32:23,890
2010 off of Aqualab you know they were

2178
01:32:21,489 --> 01:32:25,960
sold out immediately after so I couldn't

2179
01:32:23,890 --> 01:32:28,720
buy another one I couldn't my friends

2180
01:32:25,960 --> 01:32:30,760
couldn't buy one I had a friend who was

2181
01:32:28,720 --> 01:32:32,800
a machinist and so I just took the nail

2182
01:32:30,760 --> 01:32:35,530
over to the machine shop we made a few

2183
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:39,579
modifications and just started making

2184
01:32:35,529 --> 01:32:41,859
them for ourselves after several weeks I

2185
01:32:39,579 --> 01:32:44,109
looked at Aqualab saw they were still

2186
01:32:41,859 --> 01:32:45,969
out of stock and realized that there was

2187
01:32:44,109 --> 01:32:48,579
a potential business opportunity there

2188
01:32:45,970 --> 01:32:49,030
so I sent him an email just said hey you

2189
01:32:48,579 --> 01:32:51,819
know we

2190
01:32:49,029 --> 01:32:54,250
these available if I'm stepping on

2191
01:32:51,819 --> 01:32:57,399
anybody's toes if I'm violating a patent

2192
01:32:54,250 --> 01:33:00,729
or or someone's design or intellectual

2193
01:32:57,399 --> 01:33:02,949
property let me know and it turned out

2194
01:33:00,729 --> 01:33:04,689
that the person who was manufacturing at

2195
01:33:02,949 --> 01:33:06,010
the time was a gentleman named kab Lee I

2196
01:33:04,689 --> 01:33:08,559
don't know if you guys are familiar with

2197
01:33:06,010 --> 01:33:10,800
the Cavallino but it was the titanium

2198
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:14,410
now that existed before highly educated

2199
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:16,300
and he had taken and from my

2200
01:33:14,409 --> 01:33:18,579
understanding so this is all allegedly

2201
01:33:16,300 --> 01:33:21,100
but from one side of the story

2202
01:33:18,579 --> 01:33:23,559
Kappa Lee had taken money for an order

2203
01:33:21,100 --> 01:33:26,820
and just kind of disappeared and so he

2204
01:33:23,560 --> 01:33:31,570
created this vacuum that we stepped into

2205
01:33:26,819 --> 01:33:33,969
started innovating I owe a lot of highly

2206
01:33:31,569 --> 01:33:35,859
educated success to the people that I've

2207
01:33:33,970 --> 01:33:39,369
surrounded myself with I've been kind of

2208
01:33:35,859 --> 01:33:43,929
I would describe myself as a lucky lucky

2209
01:33:39,369 --> 01:33:49,930
fool you know my machinist Dave who you

2210
01:33:43,930 --> 01:33:53,289
know helped me first replica he is such

2211
01:33:49,930 --> 01:33:55,570
a very left brain individual he's always

2212
01:33:53,289 --> 01:33:57,579
building his own servers he's basically

2213
01:33:55,569 --> 01:33:59,590
built his own Netflix platform that's

2214
01:33:57,579 --> 01:34:01,769
private where he rips all his own DVDs

2215
01:33:59,590 --> 01:34:06,190
he gives me access to just this weird

2216
01:34:01,770 --> 01:34:09,640
genius guy and so I have I had the idea

2217
01:34:06,189 --> 01:34:11,619
of doing an electronic mill because I

2218
01:34:09,640 --> 01:34:14,650
knew that the torch for dabbing was seen

2219
01:34:11,619 --> 01:34:17,050
as sort of a negative connotation people

2220
01:34:14,649 --> 01:34:19,869
associated it with you know smoking meth

2221
01:34:17,050 --> 01:34:22,779
or doing weird hardcore drugs like that

2222
01:34:19,869 --> 01:34:24,960
and we wanted to try and try and remove

2223
01:34:22,779 --> 01:34:29,739
the torch from the equation if possible

2224
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:32,109
to make it more socially acceptable we

2225
01:34:29,739 --> 01:34:33,969
didn't really understand what we were

2226
01:34:32,109 --> 01:34:35,949
doing in the product or what we were

2227
01:34:33,970 --> 01:34:38,470
going to get and as the outcome of the

2228
01:34:35,949 --> 01:34:40,359
product but I just had the idea anybody

2229
01:34:38,470 --> 01:34:43,119
can have an idea you know it's easy to

2230
01:34:40,359 --> 01:34:45,969
have an idea the genius that did the

2231
01:34:43,119 --> 01:34:50,229
email is a gentleman by the name of Dave

2232
01:34:45,970 --> 01:34:52,360
Jensen and I just told him what I wanted

2233
01:34:50,229 --> 01:34:54,669
I knew that other people were gonna be

2234
01:34:52,359 --> 01:34:57,479
working on it I figured that it was

2235
01:34:54,670 --> 01:35:00,190
important for us to get to market first

2236
01:34:57,479 --> 01:35:00,989
and so I just put a lot of pressure on

2237
01:35:00,189 --> 01:35:04,049
him

2238
01:35:00,989 --> 01:35:06,960
to to come up with a design and our

2239
01:35:04,050 --> 01:35:09,720
first problem was back then the domeless

2240
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:12,180
design didn't exist it was just all dome

2241
01:35:09,720 --> 01:35:14,100
and nails and so the hardest thing for

2242
01:35:12,180 --> 01:35:17,810
us to figure out was how are we gonna

2243
01:35:14,100 --> 01:35:22,289
get wires inside of this dome

2244
01:35:17,810 --> 01:35:25,680
contraption and not compromise you know

2245
01:35:22,289 --> 01:35:29,519
the integrity of the airflow or getting

2246
01:35:25,680 --> 01:35:31,890
the wires all gunked up and reclaim just

2247
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:36,300
certain things around that so we we were

2248
01:35:31,890 --> 01:35:37,860
trying to figure that out and during

2249
01:35:36,300 --> 01:35:39,600
this time we ended up coming out with

2250
01:35:37,859 --> 01:35:42,059
the v3 adjustable now I don't know if

2251
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:44,220
you guys know what that is but it was a

2252
01:35:42,060 --> 01:35:45,750
an adjustable nail for the domes that

2253
01:35:44,220 --> 01:35:48,480
could make it adjust to certain Heights

2254
01:35:45,750 --> 01:35:51,329
because not all glass contraptions came

2255
01:35:48,479 --> 01:35:53,369
to the same standard sizes some people

2256
01:35:51,329 --> 01:35:55,769
had larger domes other people had

2257
01:35:53,369 --> 01:35:58,079
smaller domes and so the v3 now could

2258
01:35:55,770 --> 01:36:00,210
adjust up and down and again you know

2259
01:35:58,079 --> 01:36:02,100
that wasn't even my design either that

2260
01:36:00,210 --> 01:36:05,039
could be attributed to the genius of

2261
01:36:02,100 --> 01:36:06,960
Chad from health Stone class who you

2262
01:36:05,039 --> 01:36:08,699
know another person in this industry who

2263
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:10,770
helped pioneer some different

2264
01:36:08,699 --> 01:36:12,720
vaporization essential products and he

2265
01:36:10,770 --> 01:36:16,590
actually pitched that idea to me

2266
01:36:12,720 --> 01:36:19,320
in an online chat like this and so you

2267
01:36:16,590 --> 01:36:22,380
know all praise to Chad for that that

2268
01:36:19,319 --> 01:36:25,019
idea but after that came out we started

2269
01:36:22,380 --> 01:36:27,119
thinking okay so what's next for for the

2270
01:36:25,020 --> 01:36:29,070
nail like it what's after what else can

2271
01:36:27,119 --> 01:36:30,630
you do to these things and we thought

2272
01:36:29,069 --> 01:36:32,969
well what if the what if the shaft was

2273
01:36:30,630 --> 01:36:34,980
hollow what could you do then and I

2274
01:36:32,970 --> 01:36:36,300
started thinking well the hollow shaft

2275
01:36:34,979 --> 01:36:38,879
doesn't make any sense

2276
01:36:36,300 --> 01:36:41,640
and then I was like whoa it doesn't she

2277
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:43,710
take the dome away but we were working

2278
01:36:41,640 --> 01:36:45,960
on a prototype and right at that time

2279
01:36:43,710 --> 01:36:48,119
the first domeless nail came on to

2280
01:36:45,960 --> 01:36:51,149
market that I'm aware of was called the

2281
01:36:48,119 --> 01:36:53,729
ko domeless nail and I believe it was

2282
01:36:51,149 --> 01:36:58,079
developed by a guy named Kevin nail if

2283
01:36:53,729 --> 01:37:00,719
I'm if I remember correctly Gary might

2284
01:36:58,079 --> 01:37:02,699
know some more about that because I

2285
01:37:00,720 --> 01:37:06,960
remember he was around in that that time

2286
01:37:02,699 --> 01:37:09,689
frame as well anyways once I saw the

2287
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:11,789
domeless now and once we had our first

2288
01:37:09,689 --> 01:37:13,379
prototype of our homeless nail out I

2289
01:37:11,789 --> 01:37:15,569
immediately realized

2290
01:37:13,380 --> 01:37:18,960
you know we've we've unlocked the

2291
01:37:15,569 --> 01:37:21,539
solution for getting the cables into the

2292
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:23,698
to the nail now without having by

2293
01:37:21,539 --> 01:37:25,590
removing the dome we can now just get a

2294
01:37:23,698 --> 01:37:29,069
heating element wrapped right around it

2295
01:37:25,590 --> 01:37:33,739
I pitched the idea to my machinist and

2296
01:37:29,069 --> 01:37:33,738
he spent you know a week or two

2297
01:37:34,250 --> 01:37:41,908
researching components found you know a

2298
01:37:37,590 --> 01:37:44,219
PID found a heating coil from a heating

2299
01:37:41,908 --> 01:37:46,170
manufacturer who would go on to end up

2300
01:37:44,219 --> 01:37:51,000
you know [ __ ] us over later on but

2301
01:37:46,170 --> 01:37:53,869
that's a whole other story and he you

2302
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:57,119
know got the the sheet metal lasered out

2303
01:37:53,869 --> 01:38:00,029
the sheet metal to cut and Bend the

2304
01:37:57,119 --> 01:38:01,710
housings for the electronic units you

2305
01:38:00,029 --> 01:38:04,170
know some of these components like the

2306
01:38:01,710 --> 01:38:07,469
PID came from overseas but as far as

2307
01:38:04,170 --> 01:38:10,350
everything else it was fully cut built

2308
01:38:07,469 --> 01:38:13,980
assembled here in the United States and

2309
01:38:10,350 --> 01:38:15,750
he built four prototypes I took one of

2310
01:38:13,979 --> 01:38:19,709
them with me to the San Francisco

2311
01:38:15,750 --> 01:38:24,689
cannabis cup in I think it was in 2010

2312
01:38:19,710 --> 01:38:26,520
it might have been 2011 actually and

2313
01:38:24,689 --> 01:38:29,009
that's where we showed it off for the

2314
01:38:26,520 --> 01:38:31,860
first time and it was a major hit and

2315
01:38:29,010 --> 01:38:34,889
with the release of the email we we

2316
01:38:31,859 --> 01:38:37,829
started to kind of discover you know low

2317
01:38:34,889 --> 01:38:39,420
lower temperature dabs when the email

2318
01:38:37,829 --> 01:38:42,539
first came out there weren't carb caps

2319
01:38:39,420 --> 01:38:46,219
and so in order to put a DAB on that

2320
01:38:42,539 --> 01:38:51,420
would fully cook off within your breath

2321
01:38:46,219 --> 01:38:54,329
you it had to be set at 1085 Fahrenheit

2322
01:38:51,420 --> 01:38:55,739
on the coil and that everybody hearing

2323
01:38:54,329 --> 01:38:57,779
that now would probably be like wow

2324
01:38:55,738 --> 01:38:59,908
that's that's incredibly hot but with

2325
01:38:57,779 --> 01:39:01,319
without a carb cap back then that was

2326
01:38:59,908 --> 01:39:03,569
almost the temperature you had to have

2327
01:39:01,319 --> 01:39:09,539
it set out to make the all the oil cook

2328
01:39:03,569 --> 01:39:11,340
away and so anyways that was how the

2329
01:39:09,539 --> 01:39:13,560
email came to be I don't mean I don't

2330
01:39:11,340 --> 01:39:16,199
want to ramble on too long so I'll start

2331
01:39:13,560 --> 01:39:18,270
tying my entire stories all together but

2332
01:39:16,198 --> 01:39:20,369
but that was the invention of the email

2333
01:39:18,270 --> 01:39:21,940
it was a guy named Dave Jetson who was a

2334
01:39:20,369 --> 01:39:24,340
machinist and

2335
01:39:21,939 --> 01:39:26,889
and I just pitched the idea to him and

2336
01:39:24,340 --> 01:39:28,300
he helped me make it come to life but in

2337
01:39:26,890 --> 01:39:30,039
the end you know we only ended up

2338
01:39:28,300 --> 01:39:33,430
selling a hundred and fifty units that

2339
01:39:30,039 --> 01:39:35,590
was kind of a sad story for us while we

2340
01:39:33,430 --> 01:39:39,550
birthed the email industry we never

2341
01:39:35,590 --> 01:39:43,390
really got to fully enjoy due to that

2342
01:39:39,550 --> 01:39:45,220
that email coil manufacturer that whole

2343
01:39:43,390 --> 01:39:47,650
other story which you know I could tell

2344
01:39:45,220 --> 01:39:49,360
you it and another time but we could do

2345
01:39:47,649 --> 01:39:51,569
a whole show on how we've all been

2346
01:39:49,359 --> 01:39:54,339
[ __ ] over and out in our business

2347
01:39:51,569 --> 01:39:57,399
trials and tribulations which is for

2348
01:39:54,340 --> 01:39:59,650
sharpness sorry to cut you off I

2349
01:39:57,399 --> 01:40:03,699
remember I remember tax coming out with

2350
01:39:59,649 --> 01:40:05,289
the email little area story back in 2012

2351
01:40:03,699 --> 01:40:07,569
he came over at the county connection

2352
01:40:05,289 --> 01:40:08,979
booth at the San Francisco High Times I

2353
01:40:07,569 --> 01:40:12,429
don't know if he remembers that or not

2354
01:40:08,979 --> 01:40:14,769
but he plugged the email and and in

2355
01:40:12,430 --> 01:40:17,079
retrospect it's hilarious right now but

2356
01:40:14,770 --> 01:40:19,270
it was a very very sad moment at that

2357
01:40:17,079 --> 01:40:22,479
time where he plugged the email and I

2358
01:40:19,270 --> 01:40:26,170
think half the host power just literally

2359
01:40:22,479 --> 01:40:43,539
went out remember that that you're

2360
01:40:26,170 --> 01:40:46,359
talking about I blame the show for that

2361
01:40:43,539 --> 01:40:49,300
they got it back up and then the network

2362
01:40:46,359 --> 01:40:52,359
I liked I like to add the email did work

2363
01:40:49,300 --> 01:40:54,070
for the rest of the show but yes it

2364
01:40:52,359 --> 01:40:56,500
definitely did cause a little power

2365
01:40:54,069 --> 01:40:58,869
outage there for a moment and that was

2366
01:40:56,500 --> 01:41:05,560
actually a prototype wasn't it yeah it

2367
01:40:58,869 --> 01:41:11,380
was one of the four prototypes right

2368
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:13,780
there what year was that that might be

2369
01:41:11,380 --> 01:41:16,510
it that might be it I thought 2011 but

2370
01:41:13,779 --> 01:41:21,429
it might be 2012 you know my sense of

2371
01:41:16,510 --> 01:41:23,050
time just not good well to have the

2372
01:41:21,430 --> 01:41:24,369
different groups that to have the

2373
01:41:23,050 --> 01:41:27,100
different groups of you guys in here

2374
01:41:24,369 --> 01:41:30,489
from like you know Gary with the pen

2375
01:41:27,100 --> 01:41:32,800
aspect with mark from so many years ago

2376
01:41:30,489 --> 01:41:34,359
as well as vaporbrothers with these

2377
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:36,760
different

2378
01:41:34,359 --> 01:41:38,649
you know produce your own air force

2379
01:41:36,760 --> 01:41:40,239
there and the first time I ever ripped

2380
01:41:38,649 --> 01:41:43,118
was definitely like a memorable

2381
01:41:40,238 --> 01:41:44,968
experience with tasks with highly

2382
01:41:43,118 --> 01:41:47,679
educated like definitely helping

2383
01:41:44,969 --> 01:41:49,868
popularize dabbing for certain that's

2384
01:41:47,679 --> 01:41:56,230
the first name I heard with the titanium

2385
01:41:49,868 --> 01:41:58,569
nails and the the carb caps so very cool

2386
01:41:56,229 --> 01:42:01,388
and now say bow out with the vape exhale

2387
01:41:58,569 --> 01:42:03,279
you know in an in my opinion one of the

2388
01:42:01,389 --> 01:42:05,260
kind of younger up-and-coming guys

2389
01:42:03,279 --> 01:42:07,329
that's just got the super flare and the

2390
01:42:05,260 --> 01:42:10,510
excitement and is able to articulate his

2391
01:42:07,329 --> 01:42:13,448
message in this intelligent and has has

2392
01:42:10,510 --> 01:42:15,820
a great little unit like in folks favor

2393
01:42:13,448 --> 01:42:18,250
inspire me before I ever got into it

2394
01:42:15,819 --> 01:42:20,408
before I ever saw highly educated I mean

2395
01:42:18,250 --> 01:42:23,260
you were he'll stone monkey or stoner

2396
01:42:20,408 --> 01:42:27,189
monkey or something like it is me and

2397
01:42:23,260 --> 01:42:29,440
and that is my gamertag on ps4 so if

2398
01:42:27,189 --> 01:42:32,948
anyone wants to find me still monkey 55

2399
01:42:29,439 --> 01:42:34,809
I remember I remember back in the day

2400
01:42:32,948 --> 01:42:36,849
before I even started highly-educated I

2401
01:42:34,810 --> 01:42:39,130
was I was using the heat gun to vaporize

2402
01:42:36,850 --> 01:42:42,369
weed I even made a song about it a heavy

2403
01:42:39,130 --> 01:42:45,329
duty heavy duty heat gun no that all

2404
01:42:42,368 --> 01:42:48,819
starts with Mark McCoy so it's that mark

2405
01:42:45,329 --> 01:42:50,979
how everything is a pain at war

2406
01:42:48,819 --> 01:42:53,380
yeah you know the first time I hit one

2407
01:42:50,979 --> 01:42:55,509
of those heat guns was probably with

2408
01:42:53,380 --> 01:42:58,840
from Eagle bill but the first time it

2409
01:42:55,510 --> 01:43:00,520
rocked me was definitely with Mark McCoy

2410
01:42:58,840 --> 01:43:06,460
he was like yeah that's because you just

2411
01:43:00,520 --> 01:43:07,960
got a rip yeah alright oh it's great to

2412
01:43:06,460 --> 01:43:10,029
have this conversation going you know I

2413
01:43:07,960 --> 01:43:12,698
guess at that point in time we're just

2414
01:43:10,029 --> 01:43:15,519
we're in the discussion we did the the

2415
01:43:12,698 --> 01:43:18,309
past we're in the current we're in the

2416
01:43:15,520 --> 01:43:19,869
present of vaporisation and I guess you

2417
01:43:18,310 --> 01:43:21,789
know if you guys wanted to get into a

2418
01:43:19,868 --> 01:43:23,799
particular type of conversation I don't

2419
01:43:21,789 --> 01:43:25,569
know if we want to flow naturally or if

2420
01:43:23,800 --> 01:43:27,850
we want to direct it into what we all

2421
01:43:25,569 --> 01:43:29,289
think the future of vaporization is

2422
01:43:27,850 --> 01:43:31,210
that's what's we're going to kind of

2423
01:43:29,289 --> 01:43:33,189
hammer out for the last hour of the show

2424
01:43:31,210 --> 01:43:34,750
but we still have a little bit of time

2425
01:43:33,189 --> 01:43:36,069
if we want to talk about the present

2426
01:43:34,750 --> 01:43:39,039
still what's going on today

2427
01:43:36,069 --> 01:43:41,289
I mean it's there's a lot going on up

2428
01:43:39,039 --> 01:43:42,310
there as the cannabis industry blows up

2429
01:43:41,289 --> 01:43:45,719
worldwide

2430
01:43:42,310 --> 01:43:48,810
I wonder if vaporizers will really ever

2431
01:43:45,719 --> 01:43:51,420
finally transfer over

2432
01:43:48,810 --> 01:43:53,190
when Mark met me back in the day you

2433
01:43:51,420 --> 01:43:54,720
must have been to the melting point and

2434
01:43:53,189 --> 01:43:56,729
seeing the inhalation station of

2435
01:43:54,720 --> 01:43:59,340
vaporization that was pretty early for

2436
01:43:56,729 --> 01:44:01,589
its time because because the law was

2437
01:43:59,340 --> 01:44:03,989
illegal but because the law was legal we

2438
01:44:01,590 --> 01:44:06,600
had exemption 56 s we had these sort of

2439
01:44:03,989 --> 01:44:09,119
MMAR licenses that people could have in

2440
01:44:06,600 --> 01:44:11,280
Canada so I just used the mentality that

2441
01:44:09,119 --> 01:44:13,140
well it's not up to me to police people

2442
01:44:11,279 --> 01:44:15,630
to see if they have a license to consume

2443
01:44:13,140 --> 01:44:17,579
cannabis medically I can just produce an

2444
01:44:15,630 --> 01:44:19,199
environment where they can come and I

2445
01:44:17,579 --> 01:44:21,960
had a table with a variety of these

2446
01:44:19,199 --> 01:44:26,420
vaporizers from you know the volatize er

2447
01:44:21,960 --> 01:44:28,590
the aromatic of thrip Tec the volcano I

2448
01:44:26,420 --> 01:44:30,390
think there was a couple of others on

2449
01:44:28,590 --> 01:44:31,710
there that I might be forgetting but

2450
01:44:30,390 --> 01:44:34,020
just to be able to have people come in

2451
01:44:31,710 --> 01:44:37,020
and test the units on their own was such

2452
01:44:34,020 --> 01:44:39,360
a nice thing we used a lot of other

2453
01:44:37,020 --> 01:44:41,370
herbs and it would be interesting to see

2454
01:44:39,359 --> 01:44:44,309
I've personally used herbs with bubble

2455
01:44:41,369 --> 01:44:46,529
banks and extracted hashes or oil

2456
01:44:44,310 --> 01:44:48,390
extracts with you know micro

2457
01:44:46,529 --> 01:44:50,429
encapsulated oils and trichome heads

2458
01:44:48,390 --> 01:44:53,610
with the bubble bags using water and ice

2459
01:44:50,430 --> 01:44:55,829
and I just wonder if you know the

2460
01:44:53,609 --> 01:44:58,199
popularity of vaporization clearly being

2461
01:44:55,829 --> 01:45:02,720
fueled and passioned by the cannabis

2462
01:44:58,199 --> 01:45:05,579
both patient and recreational

2463
01:45:02,720 --> 01:45:07,409
communities I wonder if the herbs will

2464
01:45:05,579 --> 01:45:09,390
finally ever break over and will start

2465
01:45:07,409 --> 01:45:11,099
vaporizing these different herbs through

2466
01:45:09,390 --> 01:45:12,840
all of these different units you know

2467
01:45:11,100 --> 01:45:14,510
more than just trying it and never doing

2468
01:45:12,840 --> 01:45:17,340
it again

2469
01:45:14,510 --> 01:45:22,079
well in reality all our devices are made

2470
01:45:17,340 --> 01:45:24,119
for herbs that are legal used yeah well

2471
01:45:22,079 --> 01:45:26,130
I'm in Canada we're federally it's legal

2472
01:45:24,119 --> 01:45:31,019
to use cannabis and soon we'll have a

2473
01:45:26,130 --> 01:45:32,690
federally legal recreational system here

2474
01:45:31,020 --> 01:45:36,450
this year we're supposed to get

2475
01:45:32,689 --> 01:45:37,979
federally legal rack so that changes the

2476
01:45:36,449 --> 01:45:39,659
game I think all of you guys should come

2477
01:45:37,979 --> 01:45:44,129
up here and make some videos for your

2478
01:45:39,659 --> 01:45:45,960
companies do it I think I think more

2479
01:45:44,130 --> 01:45:48,170
progressive formulation is going to be a

2480
01:45:45,960 --> 01:45:52,310
big part of the future for sure and

2481
01:45:48,170 --> 01:45:55,109
devices that are able to adapt to the

2482
01:45:52,310 --> 01:45:57,390
substances that you want to vaporize and

2483
01:45:55,109 --> 01:45:59,219
a much broader spectrum of terpenes

2484
01:45:57,390 --> 01:46:00,729
flavonoids and various active

2485
01:45:59,220 --> 01:46:02,440
constituents

2486
01:46:00,729 --> 01:46:04,719
be able to adapt to the users

2487
01:46:02,439 --> 01:46:07,658
preferences or and/or perhaps the

2488
01:46:04,719 --> 01:46:09,670
extraction artists as they like to be

2489
01:46:07,658 --> 01:46:13,420
called preferences - in other words

2490
01:46:09,670 --> 01:46:16,479
being able to adapt the device to

2491
01:46:13,420 --> 01:46:18,639
deliver you know how much of the oil to

2492
01:46:16,479 --> 01:46:20,440
the organoleptic experience the throat

2493
01:46:18,639 --> 01:46:23,019
and mouth feel the flavor and how much

2494
01:46:20,439 --> 01:46:25,299
of it - the pharmacokinetics the the

2495
01:46:23,019 --> 01:46:28,599
deep tissue smaller particle delivery

2496
01:46:25,300 --> 01:46:30,729
and you know to be able to tune that

2497
01:46:28,599 --> 01:46:32,380
either in a way that's fixed you know by

2498
01:46:30,729 --> 01:46:35,889
the manufacturer they can say this is

2499
01:46:32,380 --> 01:46:38,578
what I think is right or to the users of

2500
01:46:35,889 --> 01:46:41,050
separates and perhaps even be able to

2501
01:46:38,578 --> 01:46:42,939
adapt to the users preference by

2502
01:46:41,050 --> 01:46:44,380
artificial intelligence or machine

2503
01:46:42,939 --> 01:46:46,598
learning and looking at the way they're

2504
01:46:44,380 --> 01:46:51,479
dialing and tuning their device and the

2505
01:46:46,599 --> 01:46:52,989
types of rips they're taking well mark

2506
01:46:51,479 --> 01:46:56,699
no you go ahead

2507
01:46:52,988 --> 01:47:00,069
I was I was actually gonna state that

2508
01:46:56,698 --> 01:47:01,808
what you're saying is we are there's a

2509
01:47:00,069 --> 01:47:03,759
lot more to go from my understanding of

2510
01:47:01,809 --> 01:47:06,130
what the vaporizers can achieve because

2511
01:47:03,760 --> 01:47:08,440
we've barely hardly started scratching

2512
01:47:06,130 --> 01:47:09,940
the surface because at this moment we

2513
01:47:08,439 --> 01:47:12,549
don't fully understand the cannabis

2514
01:47:09,939 --> 01:47:15,368
plant itself once we understand what

2515
01:47:12,550 --> 01:47:17,739
cannabinoids and how terpenes affect THC

2516
01:47:15,368 --> 01:47:19,509
a and all and all the other different

2517
01:47:17,738 --> 01:47:23,828
compounds is where we can actually start

2518
01:47:19,510 --> 01:47:26,320
designing vaporizers that might be maybe

2519
01:47:23,828 --> 01:47:28,118
a three phase unit where it starts at

2520
01:47:26,319 --> 01:47:30,908
certain temperatures goes up and down

2521
01:47:28,118 --> 01:47:33,279
and back you know sideways whichever way

2522
01:47:30,908 --> 01:47:35,078
you want it to design the unit but what

2523
01:47:33,279 --> 01:47:37,719
I'm saying is until we finally

2524
01:47:35,078 --> 01:47:40,689
understand the plant itself we literally

2525
01:47:37,719 --> 01:47:42,609
cannot design a unit that is perfect

2526
01:47:40,689 --> 01:47:45,549
does that make sense or only makes sense

2527
01:47:42,609 --> 01:47:47,439
in my mind no it's a it's a very

2528
01:47:45,550 --> 01:47:48,940
complicated process I mean this is why

2529
01:47:47,439 --> 01:47:51,279
the pharmaceutical companies have been

2530
01:47:48,939 --> 01:47:53,978
fearful of cannabis for so long it's why

2531
01:47:51,279 --> 01:47:56,349
it's a tough subject for the regulatory

2532
01:47:53,979 --> 01:47:58,780
agencies that are used to reductionist

2533
01:47:56,349 --> 01:48:00,400
Western science absolutely one thing

2534
01:47:58,779 --> 01:48:02,618
though that is very clear and that is

2535
01:48:00,399 --> 01:48:04,920
that just like growing in the natural

2536
01:48:02,618 --> 01:48:07,238
Sun as opposed to growing under

2537
01:48:04,920 --> 01:48:09,479
artificial light we know that with

2538
01:48:07,238 --> 01:48:13,388
vaporizing we are creating very

2539
01:48:09,479 --> 01:48:14,389
sophisticated spectrums you know major

2540
01:48:13,389 --> 01:48:17,389
cannabinoids but

2541
01:48:14,389 --> 01:48:20,559
minor cannabinoids terpene expression

2542
01:48:17,389 --> 01:48:24,409
based upon thermal gradients the canna

2543
01:48:20,559 --> 01:48:26,630
Canada mimetic effects I mean yet no no

2544
01:48:24,408 --> 01:48:29,299
one no one has this understood black and

2545
01:48:26,630 --> 01:48:33,139
white to gospel but we do know it's more

2546
01:48:29,300 --> 01:48:36,288
sophisticated than then how many people

2547
01:48:33,139 --> 01:48:38,359
make it out to be I think that's where I

2548
01:48:36,288 --> 01:48:40,569
think really it's going to come into a

2549
01:48:38,359 --> 01:48:43,248
Linus hit on this earlier you know the

2550
01:48:40,569 --> 01:48:44,868
in my opinion the superiority of the

2551
01:48:43,248 --> 01:48:46,550
human sensor you can have all these

2552
01:48:44,868 --> 01:48:49,368
complicated sensors but at the end of

2553
01:48:46,550 --> 01:48:51,559
the day you know from my experience if

2554
01:48:49,368 --> 01:48:54,139
it tasted really good and it felt really

2555
01:48:51,559 --> 01:48:55,760
good it worked really good if it didn't

2556
01:48:54,139 --> 01:48:59,529
taste really good and it didn't feel

2557
01:48:55,760 --> 01:49:07,820
really good it didn't work so well and

2558
01:48:59,529 --> 01:49:09,679
that is scientific but you gotta

2559
01:49:07,819 --> 01:49:11,688
understand every person's chemistry is

2560
01:49:09,679 --> 01:49:13,699
different so that's why we have people

2561
01:49:11,689 --> 01:49:15,168
that like the vapor brothers that use

2562
01:49:13,698 --> 01:49:18,589
the vapor brothers then we have people

2563
01:49:15,168 --> 01:49:20,748
that use the V Reb we V reptak and we

2564
01:49:18,590 --> 01:49:24,168
have people that use you know the VAP

2565
01:49:20,748 --> 01:49:25,998
Excel it just a preference where one

2566
01:49:24,168 --> 01:49:28,038
unit might not work for everybody

2567
01:49:25,998 --> 01:49:30,559
where there's different units out there

2568
01:49:28,038 --> 01:49:33,679
does that make sense yeah I think as

2569
01:49:30,559 --> 01:49:35,929
bubble man said also uh I own all of

2570
01:49:33,679 --> 01:49:37,399
these vaporizers so I use them all

2571
01:49:35,929 --> 01:49:40,729
differently at different times depending

2572
01:49:37,399 --> 01:49:43,729
on the use case and my mood and and what

2573
01:49:40,729 --> 01:49:46,039
what type of user experience I want so I

2574
01:49:43,729 --> 01:49:47,809
would say it even gets more granular

2575
01:49:46,038 --> 01:49:50,059
than that and that you know just

2576
01:49:47,809 --> 01:49:52,458
depending on your circumstance you know

2577
01:49:50,059 --> 01:49:53,840
you will utilize different devices I

2578
01:49:52,458 --> 01:49:56,748
mean you know obviously mine is a

2579
01:49:53,840 --> 01:49:58,969
plug-in portable devices have advantages

2580
01:49:56,748 --> 01:50:01,639
there and then although both mark and

2581
01:49:58,969 --> 01:50:04,519
eyes have all glass air pads you know I

2582
01:50:01,639 --> 01:50:06,739
do find there is a distinct kind of

2583
01:50:04,519 --> 01:50:09,168
resonance to his device that is missing

2584
01:50:06,738 --> 01:50:10,879
in mine and you know and there are times

2585
01:50:09,168 --> 01:50:12,380
when I will utilize this device instead

2586
01:50:10,880 --> 01:50:14,029
of mine and it all depends on my

2587
01:50:12,380 --> 01:50:16,239
preference at the time but I think the

2588
01:50:14,029 --> 01:50:19,550
great news is we all have the option to

2589
01:50:16,238 --> 01:50:22,118
to have all these various options yeah

2590
01:50:19,550 --> 01:50:24,469
I've got what was like like go ahead

2591
01:50:22,118 --> 01:50:26,448
people asking exactly you know what do

2592
01:50:24,469 --> 01:50:28,130
you think is best I say what's best is

2593
01:50:26,448 --> 01:50:29,629
what is best for you at

2594
01:50:28,130 --> 01:50:32,619
that point in time you know it's your

2595
01:50:29,630 --> 01:50:34,909
ritual your session what's the best bit

2596
01:50:32,619 --> 01:50:36,349
well it goes back to what Linus said

2597
01:50:34,908 --> 01:50:37,879
earlier names like oh I I don't know if

2598
01:50:36,350 --> 01:50:39,710
it's an American thing but we always

2599
01:50:37,880 --> 01:50:41,150
like we're over this way or over that

2600
01:50:39,710 --> 01:50:43,250
way it's always one thing or the other

2601
01:50:41,149 --> 01:50:45,319
and I think it's said to be for not for

2602
01:50:43,250 --> 01:50:47,119
North America because Canadians happen

2603
01:50:45,319 --> 01:50:49,279
in them as well I've been fighting it

2604
01:50:47,119 --> 01:50:52,158
for the last ten years and it's why I'm

2605
01:50:49,279 --> 01:50:54,769
much more into having a quiver than

2606
01:50:52,158 --> 01:50:57,529
thinking that one thing is better like a

2607
01:50:54,770 --> 01:51:00,350
one-shot wonder just one arrow for every

2608
01:50:57,529 --> 01:51:03,079
shot I take I want to fit as many arrows

2609
01:51:00,350 --> 01:51:04,789
in my quiver as possible regardless of

2610
01:51:03,079 --> 01:51:07,219
whether it's in regards to hitting off

2611
01:51:04,789 --> 01:51:10,729
of a surface on an electric nail from

2612
01:51:07,219 --> 01:51:12,469
titanium to quartz to sapphire to

2613
01:51:10,729 --> 01:51:14,839
silicon carbide all these different

2614
01:51:12,469 --> 01:51:17,239
surfaces I like them because they they

2615
01:51:14,840 --> 01:51:19,400
preserve the terpene profile differently

2616
01:51:17,238 --> 01:51:22,009
when I hit a dab off each and every one

2617
01:51:19,399 --> 01:51:24,138
of them at the exact same temperature so

2618
01:51:22,010 --> 01:51:26,630
I know something's going on my bio assay

2619
01:51:24,139 --> 01:51:29,029
is pretty tuned for cannabis I would say

2620
01:51:26,630 --> 01:51:30,829
the way mark was mentioning earlier that

2621
01:51:29,029 --> 01:51:33,559
that and mine is saying that that is

2622
01:51:30,829 --> 01:51:35,689
science you know I remember running mint

2623
01:51:33,560 --> 01:51:38,330
through my bags the first time back in

2624
01:51:35,689 --> 01:51:42,339
99 or 2000 putting a little bit of the

2625
01:51:38,329 --> 01:51:44,539
mint into a bowl and puffing it

2626
01:51:42,340 --> 01:51:46,670
interesting and then I put a bunch of

2627
01:51:44,539 --> 01:51:49,130
bubble hash and a bunch of mint into a

2628
01:51:46,670 --> 01:51:50,929
bowl and I puffed that and I blew it out

2629
01:51:49,130 --> 01:51:53,980
and I was like wow like I didn't cough

2630
01:51:50,929 --> 01:51:57,460
at all and so I punched into Google mint

2631
01:51:53,979 --> 01:51:59,779
and cough and I came up with this like

2632
01:51:57,460 --> 01:52:02,389
multi-million dollar study that like

2633
01:51:59,779 --> 01:52:04,759
Phillips Morris did on designing the

2634
01:52:02,389 --> 01:52:06,619
mentholated cigarette they spent like 12

2635
01:52:04,760 --> 01:52:09,710
million dollars to come up with the fact

2636
01:52:06,619 --> 01:52:12,769
that mint is a good thing to add into

2637
01:52:09,710 --> 01:52:15,649
cigarettes to suppress cough I did it in

2638
01:52:12,770 --> 01:52:17,780
like 40 minutes with like a bomb some

2639
01:52:15,649 --> 01:52:19,908
matches and a set of bubbled eggs and a

2640
01:52:17,779 --> 01:52:22,009
little bit of mint so there is value in

2641
01:52:19,908 --> 01:52:23,779
these bio assays whether we're doing

2642
01:52:22,010 --> 01:52:26,929
them as experiments in front of us or

2643
01:52:23,779 --> 01:52:29,779
whether we're inhaling into our lungs to

2644
01:52:26,929 --> 01:52:31,369
taste these different profiles yeah it's

2645
01:52:29,779 --> 01:52:33,019
all about the quiver that's why I'm so

2646
01:52:31,369 --> 01:52:34,819
happy to see all of you guys in this

2647
01:52:33,020 --> 01:52:36,800
room go ahead task it's the same thing

2648
01:52:34,819 --> 01:52:39,539
with with you know foods and beverages

2649
01:52:36,800 --> 01:52:41,789
you know like some people mm-hmm

2650
01:52:39,539 --> 01:52:44,670
don't like coke out of a can but they

2651
01:52:41,789 --> 01:52:46,229
love it out of a glass bottle some

2652
01:52:44,670 --> 01:52:48,420
people don't like their their food

2653
01:52:46,229 --> 01:52:50,579
cooked on on certain materials or

2654
01:52:48,420 --> 01:52:54,119
certain materials may cook more evenly

2655
01:52:50,579 --> 01:52:56,250
and more better sometimes you just you

2656
01:52:54,119 --> 01:53:00,899
know where I find inspiration sometimes

2657
01:52:56,250 --> 01:53:03,329
is from spots like that when seeing how

2658
01:53:00,899 --> 01:53:05,819
something cooks or seeing how I mean

2659
01:53:03,329 --> 01:53:07,920
even our newest product shameless plug

2660
01:53:05,819 --> 01:53:12,170
here on our new product we just put out

2661
01:53:07,920 --> 01:53:15,480
a new quartz banger called the gavel and

2662
01:53:12,170 --> 01:53:18,029
we've got a textured surface on the

2663
01:53:15,479 --> 01:53:21,079
bottom which favors the creation of

2664
01:53:18,029 --> 01:53:23,130
nucleation sites which helps facilitate

2665
01:53:21,079 --> 01:53:27,539
vaporization exceedingly lower

2666
01:53:23,130 --> 01:53:31,230
temperatures and kind of learned that

2667
01:53:27,539 --> 01:53:33,180
from just you know watching beer glasses

2668
01:53:31,229 --> 01:53:35,399
and beer glasses that are designed to

2669
01:53:33,180 --> 01:53:39,780
have you know etched bottoms to help

2670
01:53:35,399 --> 01:53:42,649
facilitate the the carbonation

2671
01:53:39,779 --> 01:53:45,059
separation from from the beer

2672
01:53:42,649 --> 01:53:48,089
interesting how a simple process like

2673
01:53:45,060 --> 01:53:50,310
adding that texture to the bottom of the

2674
01:53:48,090 --> 01:53:53,329
the gavel it reminded me when you said

2675
01:53:50,310 --> 01:53:56,010
it of Indra talking about his

2676
01:53:53,329 --> 01:53:58,619
hydrocarbon extraction machine of his

2677
01:53:56,010 --> 01:54:01,409
extractor and how by putting these

2678
01:53:58,619 --> 01:54:03,800
little divots inside his his chamber

2679
01:54:01,409 --> 01:54:07,109
when he puts because he doesn't have a

2680
01:54:03,800 --> 01:54:10,350
column like most of these products are

2681
01:54:07,109 --> 01:54:12,389
made mainly he does gas goes in and it

2682
01:54:10,350 --> 01:54:14,430
starts channeling and creating highways

2683
01:54:12,390 --> 01:54:16,350
and it doesn't touch all the material

2684
01:54:14,430 --> 01:54:18,360
well he drilled all these holes into the

2685
01:54:16,350 --> 01:54:21,150
inside of his chamber and so when the

2686
01:54:18,359 --> 01:54:24,239
gas goes in it hits these walls and it

2687
01:54:21,149 --> 01:54:26,729
causes cavitation which sends bubbles

2688
01:54:24,239 --> 01:54:28,800
back into the material and moves all the

2689
01:54:26,729 --> 01:54:31,529
material fully a hundred percent at a

2690
01:54:28,800 --> 01:54:33,539
time consistently and that really

2691
01:54:31,529 --> 01:54:35,429
reminded me of what you simply did with

2692
01:54:33,539 --> 01:54:40,729
your quartz banger that's [ __ ]

2693
01:54:35,430 --> 01:54:42,840
awesome thanks it's awesome very cool

2694
01:54:40,729 --> 01:54:44,729
well I'm feeling pretty good about this

2695
01:54:42,840 --> 01:54:46,409
vaporization conversation so we're two

2696
01:54:44,729 --> 01:54:49,189
hours in where should we where should we

2697
01:54:46,409 --> 01:54:49,189
lead this Conroe

2698
01:54:51,210 --> 01:54:59,130
thrown at topic has anybody ever worked

2699
01:54:53,760 --> 01:55:04,289
with a fraction of vaporization and

2700
01:54:59,130 --> 01:55:08,190
define it well a couple of years ago we

2701
01:55:04,289 --> 01:55:10,710
were we used extra fractional

2702
01:55:08,189 --> 01:55:14,669
vaporization is just a term that we you

2703
01:55:10,710 --> 01:55:18,869
know the we made with the Hercules

2704
01:55:14,670 --> 01:55:22,470
because using urban oil at the same time

2705
01:55:18,869 --> 01:55:30,689
but using the oil to heat up the herb to

2706
01:55:22,470 --> 01:55:33,150
vaporize does that make sense so the

2707
01:55:30,689 --> 01:55:37,439
heat created by the oil would then heat

2708
01:55:33,149 --> 01:55:39,089
up the the flour the earth that the

2709
01:55:37,439 --> 01:55:41,639
flour were you would actually heat up

2710
01:55:39,090 --> 01:55:44,460
the oil to vaporize as the vapor is

2711
01:55:41,640 --> 01:55:46,829
passing through the earth the herb gets

2712
01:55:44,460 --> 01:55:49,710
slowly heated up and vaporize which

2713
01:55:46,829 --> 01:55:51,899
would act ad cannabinoids or other

2714
01:55:49,710 --> 01:55:53,939
terpenes that are not in the oil itself

2715
01:55:51,899 --> 01:55:55,949
does that make sense it sounds like the

2716
01:55:53,939 --> 01:55:57,539
perfect temperature for the oil and the

2717
01:55:55,949 --> 01:55:59,369
earth the herb likes a little less

2718
01:55:57,539 --> 01:56:02,789
temperature sometimes oil you need more

2719
01:55:59,369 --> 01:56:03,119
temperature to get that fast see that's

2720
01:56:02,789 --> 01:56:05,430
the thing

2721
01:56:03,119 --> 01:56:07,430
well back I said has anybody ever

2722
01:56:05,430 --> 01:56:11,490
experienced something like that or

2723
01:56:07,430 --> 01:56:14,900
something like that we use oil and earth

2724
01:56:11,489 --> 01:56:18,569
together in a device that predated our

2725
01:56:14,899 --> 01:56:22,259
our dab device just dab onto a ceramic

2726
01:56:18,569 --> 01:56:24,599
surface inside but we had a before this

2727
01:56:22,260 --> 01:56:26,760
came out we had it in the vaporizer in

2728
01:56:24,600 --> 01:56:28,560
our normal vaporizer we had a way into

2729
01:56:26,760 --> 01:56:30,630
the top directly down to the heater

2730
01:56:28,560 --> 01:56:32,640
which was the right temperature we

2731
01:56:30,630 --> 01:56:36,690
wanted the oil to be at and then when

2732
01:56:32,640 --> 01:56:39,270
you connected the connected the herb you

2733
01:56:36,689 --> 01:56:41,639
created oil vapor and passed it through

2734
01:56:39,270 --> 01:56:43,410
the herb the hard part was getting both

2735
01:56:41,640 --> 01:56:45,150
to the just the right temperature that

2736
01:56:43,409 --> 01:56:47,039
they should be at the oil at just the

2737
01:56:45,149 --> 01:56:48,479
right heater temperature we wanted it

2738
01:56:47,039 --> 01:56:51,359
dropped right down right onto the heater

2739
01:56:48,479 --> 01:56:52,919
surface in there and the herb to be but

2740
01:56:51,359 --> 01:56:58,319
when you got both though that was the

2741
01:56:52,920 --> 01:56:59,850
best that was a bet I've ever try how

2742
01:56:58,319 --> 01:57:01,578
about you mark have you tried anything

2743
01:56:59,850 --> 01:57:03,709
I've done with the vo-tech or

2744
01:57:01,578 --> 01:57:05,898
yeah I mean I've I've definitely you

2745
01:57:03,708 --> 01:57:08,688
know back in the day put a whole bunch

2746
01:57:05,899 --> 01:57:11,119
of patties of bubble hash on top of a

2747
01:57:08,689 --> 01:57:15,559
fresh pack flour and melted it all

2748
01:57:11,118 --> 01:57:18,378
together and yeah enjoyed a tea Bowl I

2749
01:57:15,559 --> 01:57:20,208
understand about the Patty part but have

2750
01:57:18,378 --> 01:57:22,550
you separated where you actually would

2751
01:57:20,208 --> 01:57:25,010
have vaporize the oil first and use the

2752
01:57:22,550 --> 01:57:28,279
old vapor from the oil to vaporize the

2753
01:57:25,010 --> 01:57:30,289
herb well I mean there was the

2754
01:57:28,279 --> 01:57:32,148
separation in another glass screen we

2755
01:57:30,288 --> 01:57:33,768
have experimented with that so it's kind

2756
01:57:32,149 --> 01:57:36,378
of like you got your flour on top of a

2757
01:57:33,769 --> 01:57:38,088
glass screen and another glass screen on

2758
01:57:36,378 --> 01:57:40,038
top of that with your with your

2759
01:57:38,088 --> 01:57:41,658
concentrate eventually they do sort of

2760
01:57:40,038 --> 01:57:43,788
meld together but you are technically

2761
01:57:41,658 --> 01:57:47,088
vaporizing the concentrate first I guess

2762
01:57:43,788 --> 01:57:55,668
um it's a little a little messy but it

2763
01:57:47,088 --> 01:57:57,078
can be fun and tasty whatever - it

2764
01:57:55,668 --> 01:58:00,648
sounds like they should be really close

2765
01:57:57,078 --> 01:58:02,599
but I mean Gary do you mean like are

2766
01:58:00,649 --> 01:58:05,419
they physically separated by a distance

2767
01:58:02,599 --> 01:58:07,989
or is is the is it almost similar to

2768
01:58:05,418 --> 01:58:11,628
putting wax right on top of your herb

2769
01:58:07,988 --> 01:58:13,398
well we experienced it with the Hercules

2770
01:58:11,628 --> 01:58:15,649
worry we would load up the Hercules

2771
01:58:13,399 --> 01:58:18,679
first and right up on top of the ceramic

2772
01:58:15,649 --> 01:58:20,838
rod we would put a metal screen and on

2773
01:58:18,679 --> 01:58:24,679
top of the metal screen we will put the

2774
01:58:20,838 --> 01:58:27,559
herb where the oil is saturated right

2775
01:58:24,679 --> 01:58:29,029
next to the the oil sits right next to

2776
01:58:27,559 --> 01:58:32,599
the ceramic rod where it gets vaporized

2777
01:58:29,029 --> 01:58:35,628
and that vapor itself gets pulled

2778
01:58:32,599 --> 01:58:39,050
through the herb which which warms up to

2779
01:58:35,628 --> 01:58:44,748
herb itself then after window when the

2780
01:58:39,050 --> 01:58:47,208
oil is done it becomes a convection wall

2781
01:58:44,748 --> 01:58:50,469
I would say hybrid convection conduction

2782
01:58:47,208 --> 01:58:53,378
for the herb itself does that make sense

2783
01:58:50,469 --> 01:58:55,998
yeah so do you get a different

2784
01:58:53,378 --> 01:58:59,448
subjectively better effect when when you

2785
01:58:55,998 --> 01:59:00,828
experience this well like I said was my

2786
01:58:59,448 --> 01:59:04,158
previous statement where we don't

2787
01:59:00,828 --> 01:59:05,658
understand the the herb the plant itself

2788
01:59:04,158 --> 01:59:07,488
hundred percent well we don't understand

2789
01:59:05,658 --> 01:59:09,848
what each compound effect how each

2790
01:59:07,488 --> 01:59:13,938
compound affects the other next compound

2791
01:59:09,849 --> 01:59:14,489
to me it basically if you let's say if

2792
01:59:13,939 --> 01:59:18,469
you have

2793
01:59:14,488 --> 01:59:21,569
Oh gol and you have an OG Kush in there

2794
01:59:18,469 --> 01:59:24,300
you get the taste of the oil but base

2795
01:59:21,569 --> 01:59:27,210
what happens is after that when the herb

2796
01:59:24,300 --> 01:59:32,489
kicks in it just intensifies it for me

2797
01:59:27,210 --> 01:59:34,288
does that make sense yeah because in the

2798
01:59:32,488 --> 01:59:36,268
because of the more compounds that are

2799
01:59:34,288 --> 01:59:39,748
found in the plant that's not in the oil

2800
01:59:36,269 --> 01:59:41,730
it actually intensifies the the high it

2801
01:59:39,748 --> 01:59:45,359
intensifies the effects that the oil

2802
01:59:41,729 --> 01:59:47,038
brings initially sets in it's a more

2803
01:59:45,359 --> 01:59:48,779
sophisticated spectrum that you're

2804
01:59:47,038 --> 01:59:50,969
extracting and delivering I mean this

2805
01:59:48,779 --> 01:59:53,399
goes and kind of speaks to you know some

2806
01:59:50,969 --> 01:59:55,739
of the research that was put out in 14

2807
01:59:53,399 --> 01:59:58,049
by the Israelis and you know a lot of us

2808
01:59:55,738 --> 02:00:00,479
old-time cultivators have said forever

2809
01:59:58,050 --> 02:00:02,730
that you know is why Sun grown cannabis

2810
02:00:00,479 --> 02:00:04,529
is a superior therapeutic agent because

2811
02:00:02,729 --> 02:00:06,479
you have more of the minor cannabinoids

2812
02:00:04,529 --> 02:00:08,429
you have more terpenes more

2813
02:00:06,479 --> 02:00:10,379
sophisticated profiles it's just like

2814
02:00:08,429 --> 02:00:13,199
you know it says this is the wine and

2815
02:00:10,380 --> 02:00:15,659
weed right you no comparison do you want

2816
02:00:13,198 --> 02:00:18,868
you know more flavor sophistication and

2817
02:00:15,658 --> 02:00:21,149
more layers there or less and yeah I

2818
02:00:18,868 --> 02:00:22,969
think that makes a lot of sense Gary you

2819
02:00:21,149 --> 02:00:25,439
also hit on a little nugget there about

2820
02:00:22,969 --> 02:00:26,998
kind of a thermal equilibrium you know

2821
02:00:25,439 --> 02:00:29,518
there's a lot of talk and vaporization

2822
02:00:26,998 --> 02:00:32,130
about the superiority of convection over

2823
02:00:29,519 --> 02:00:34,590
conduction from my experience in the way

2824
02:00:32,130 --> 02:00:36,538
that we vaporize I've always found that

2825
02:00:34,590 --> 02:00:38,969
really the magic is when you reach that

2826
02:00:36,538 --> 02:00:40,439
thermal equilibrium the important thing

2827
02:00:38,969 --> 02:00:42,719
from my experience has been the

2828
02:00:40,439 --> 02:00:46,799
materials so in other words if your

2829
02:00:42,719 --> 02:00:49,559
materials are glass or quartz especially

2830
02:00:46,800 --> 02:00:51,389
and your convective air flow heats those

2831
02:00:49,559 --> 02:00:53,519
materials up to where they reach that

2832
02:00:51,389 --> 02:00:55,739
thermal equilibrium that's where I find

2833
02:00:53,519 --> 02:00:57,809
you get the best most rapid

2834
02:00:55,738 --> 02:01:02,069
full-spectrum extractions enabling the

2835
02:00:57,809 --> 02:01:03,630
most rapid full-spectrum deliveries I

2836
02:01:02,069 --> 02:01:05,639
want to speak to that and it's something

2837
02:01:03,630 --> 02:01:07,618
that has very much to do what you just

2838
02:01:05,639 --> 02:01:12,710
mentioned Gary although we never used

2839
02:01:07,618 --> 02:01:16,049
the oil itself to vaporize the herb when

2840
02:01:12,710 --> 02:01:18,929
surfer a class Brian came up with his

2841
02:01:16,050 --> 02:01:22,110
brother with that the one that mark has

2842
02:01:18,929 --> 02:01:24,300
now innovated on and continues to push

2843
02:01:22,109 --> 02:01:26,038
they just weren't really producing it

2844
02:01:24,300 --> 02:01:27,989
like a product but it was the OG hot

2845
02:01:26,038 --> 02:01:28,500
glass like a little handle with this

2846
02:01:27,988 --> 02:01:31,469
Hawk

2847
02:01:28,500 --> 02:01:33,600
that you held into a bowl and so we

2848
02:01:31,470 --> 02:01:35,730
would put some Rene herb in there and at

2849
02:01:33,600 --> 02:01:38,160
one point I I was hitting a lot of full

2850
02:01:35,729 --> 02:01:40,439
melt Renee bubble hash and on a screen

2851
02:01:38,159 --> 02:01:41,909
but I would kind of use the match too so

2852
02:01:40,439 --> 02:01:45,359
it was just bubbling and never really

2853
02:01:41,909 --> 02:01:47,699
completely burning and I always wanted

2854
02:01:45,359 --> 02:01:48,899
to combine the two and so I asked Brian

2855
02:01:47,699 --> 02:01:50,550
if he could make something that would

2856
02:01:48,899 --> 02:01:53,670
combine the two and he came up with this

2857
02:01:50,550 --> 02:01:55,710
pipe that was basically two pipes melted

2858
02:01:53,670 --> 02:01:57,119
together and they go and they were

2859
02:01:55,710 --> 02:01:59,069
separate all the way up to the

2860
02:01:57,119 --> 02:02:01,470
mouthpiece where the two bomb stems

2861
02:01:59,069 --> 02:02:04,519
would spin and create one mouthpiece

2862
02:02:01,470 --> 02:02:08,220
just at the top so you would inhale I

2863
02:02:04,520 --> 02:02:09,900
saw at the vapor from the herb and on

2864
02:02:08,220 --> 02:02:12,510
the other side I would put a little full

2865
02:02:09,899 --> 02:02:14,549
melt like seventy-three micron up Renee

2866
02:02:12,510 --> 02:02:17,100
bubble hash and I would hit that with

2867
02:02:14,550 --> 02:02:18,570
the match so I would see the smoke kind

2868
02:02:17,100 --> 02:02:21,110
of go up but it was really more like a

2869
02:02:18,569 --> 02:02:23,549
vapor smoke it wasn't a harsh dirt smoke

2870
02:02:21,109 --> 02:02:25,469
you know like almost like a dad up prior

2871
02:02:23,550 --> 02:02:27,600
to dabbing and then the vapor would go

2872
02:02:25,470 --> 02:02:29,760
up and when those two joined right at

2873
02:02:27,600 --> 02:02:32,010
your mouth I swear to god you could

2874
02:02:29,760 --> 02:02:34,949
taste their separations in your mouth

2875
02:02:32,010 --> 02:02:37,680
like they were joining in your mouth and

2876
02:02:34,949 --> 02:02:39,539
to me to this day that is pretty much

2877
02:02:37,680 --> 02:02:41,430
one of the most incredible rips I've

2878
02:02:39,539 --> 02:02:43,829
ever had so if anyone wants to come up

2879
02:02:41,430 --> 02:02:46,350
with the pipe that is add a Brig but

2880
02:02:43,829 --> 02:02:49,470
also fits one of the V rip hot glass

2881
02:02:46,350 --> 02:02:51,840
wands that you should do that because

2882
02:02:49,470 --> 02:02:54,119
people don't know I'm telling you that

2883
02:02:51,840 --> 02:03:01,350
was like twelve years ago and people do

2884
02:02:54,119 --> 02:03:04,140
not know what that mean yeah I think it

2885
02:03:01,350 --> 02:03:05,880
would be some type of an email for four

2886
02:03:04,140 --> 02:03:08,910
dabs you know it could be it could be

2887
02:03:05,880 --> 02:03:10,980
this type of unit as well like you just

2888
02:03:08,909 --> 02:03:11,550
how to make it so you could do both at

2889
02:03:10,979 --> 02:03:16,709
once

2890
02:03:11,550 --> 02:03:21,270
well yeah markets have you tried dabbing

2891
02:03:16,710 --> 02:03:25,590
off a silicon nitride not unless you've

2892
02:03:21,270 --> 02:03:27,840
sent me one well take a look at what

2893
02:03:25,590 --> 02:03:29,610
Linus has I've been following this

2894
02:03:27,840 --> 02:03:32,699
product for two and a half years when

2895
02:03:29,609 --> 02:03:34,710
it's it's it's it's different it's a

2896
02:03:32,699 --> 02:03:37,019
it's a different ball field a ballpark

2897
02:03:34,710 --> 02:03:41,920
that when it comes to dabbing liners

2898
02:03:37,020 --> 02:03:44,980
show them the VB 2.50 the 2.5 yeah

2899
02:03:41,920 --> 02:03:50,140
I was gonna say I have the Omicron for

2900
02:03:44,979 --> 02:03:51,579
sure this is a silicon nitride ring yeah

2901
02:03:50,140 --> 02:03:54,369
that's what you know I was looking at

2902
02:03:51,579 --> 02:03:59,199
this is silicon carbide your unit yeah

2903
02:03:54,369 --> 02:04:01,269
that's really nice but uh this thing we

2904
02:03:59,199 --> 02:04:03,279
we put silicon nitride in there because

2905
02:04:01,270 --> 02:04:06,160
it was the ceramic surface that could

2906
02:04:03,279 --> 02:04:09,759
get extremely hot very fast and not

2907
02:04:06,159 --> 02:04:11,739
break because ceramic and glass at

2908
02:04:09,760 --> 02:04:13,900
really high temperatures if there's a

2909
02:04:11,739 --> 02:04:15,969
big thermal gradient like the edges are

2910
02:04:13,899 --> 02:04:17,349
very cold because they're being held in

2911
02:04:15,970 --> 02:04:19,840
the middle is very hot because that's

2912
02:04:17,350 --> 02:04:23,650
the heating element that just rips

2913
02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:26,770
ceramic apart so silicon nitride it

2914
02:04:23,649 --> 02:04:28,509
comes from kind of the industry the

2915
02:04:26,770 --> 02:04:32,680
heating elements that heat the that

2916
02:04:28,510 --> 02:04:34,510
light the gas on fire in your oven it's

2917
02:04:32,680 --> 02:04:37,030
a heating element ceramic that gets

2918
02:04:34,510 --> 02:04:39,789
red-hot in a few seconds and let's

2919
02:04:37,029 --> 02:04:42,069
lights the gas on fire we use the same

2920
02:04:39,789 --> 02:04:44,590
material because it's ceramic and we

2921
02:04:42,069 --> 02:04:46,809
only want to dab on on ceramic at the

2922
02:04:44,590 --> 02:04:48,699
moment that's our I mean it's kind of

2923
02:04:46,810 --> 02:04:53,860
the easy way to ensure the taste will be

2924
02:04:48,699 --> 02:04:56,470
great but yeah this unit gets up to 800

2925
02:04:53,859 --> 02:04:58,029
degree maximum in 30 seconds so right

2926
02:04:56,470 --> 02:05:01,449
here while I'm holding it it's gonna

2927
02:04:58,029 --> 02:05:02,679
tell me it's ready and the the vapor is

2928
02:05:01,449 --> 02:05:04,960
really good because it's a slightly

2929
02:05:02,680 --> 02:05:08,350
textured surface I don't know if that's

2930
02:05:04,960 --> 02:05:11,140
doing what um what did our email for I'm

2931
02:05:08,350 --> 02:05:15,340
sorry I forgot your name email hmm

2932
02:05:11,140 --> 02:05:18,700
task yes was talking about maybe on a

2933
02:05:15,340 --> 02:05:21,310
tiny scale the roughness in the surface

2934
02:05:18,699 --> 02:05:22,389
of the silicon nitride it does seem to

2935
02:05:21,310 --> 02:05:25,390
be mariah's quicker

2936
02:05:22,390 --> 02:05:26,980
we're running quite high temperatures in

2937
02:05:25,390 --> 02:05:29,920
here and that's that's a whole thing on

2938
02:05:26,979 --> 02:05:31,989
itself kind of so hot that the the

2939
02:05:29,920 --> 02:05:33,760
material doesn't actually the devs don't

2940
02:05:31,989 --> 02:05:36,460
actually touch the surface they they

2941
02:05:33,760 --> 02:05:39,190
bounce and evaporate in the air and you

2942
02:05:36,460 --> 02:05:41,170
get the entire hit in within a second

2943
02:05:39,189 --> 02:05:46,569
this is a very quick way to vaporize

2944
02:05:41,170 --> 02:05:50,609
even if it's a tiny little dot of dads

2945
02:05:46,569 --> 02:05:54,658
it'll it'll go completely and evaporate

2946
02:05:50,609 --> 02:05:55,948
but yeah this is very obviously

2947
02:05:54,658 --> 02:05:58,498
say you can't be dabbing that with the

2948
02:05:55,948 --> 02:05:59,969
lid off if it vaporizes in less than a

2949
02:05:58,498 --> 02:06:01,578
second you must have put it right

2950
02:05:59,969 --> 02:06:04,469
through the hole in the middle there

2951
02:06:01,578 --> 02:06:06,929
yeah it keeps it mostly contained our

2952
02:06:04,469 --> 02:06:09,090
first models really kept the vapor

2953
02:06:06,929 --> 02:06:10,859
contained because I'm I'm big into not

2954
02:06:09,090 --> 02:06:13,469
letting it go into big spaces and

2955
02:06:10,859 --> 02:06:15,569
learning from the dabbing guys because

2956
02:06:13,469 --> 02:06:18,538
when we made this emails were coming out

2957
02:06:15,569 --> 02:06:21,448
with those domes and those even with the

2958
02:06:18,538 --> 02:06:24,599
Domus nails they're keeping the the dab

2959
02:06:21,448 --> 02:06:27,598
smoke within a very small area this is

2960
02:06:24,599 --> 02:06:29,668
actually quite quite big but when this

2961
02:06:27,599 --> 02:06:32,458
started we were still doing bubble hash

2962
02:06:29,668 --> 02:06:34,380
and actual hash and it was the right

2963
02:06:32,458 --> 02:06:36,988
volume to keep the keep the vapor

2964
02:06:34,380 --> 02:06:39,328
contained but this hole is where you dab

2965
02:06:36,988 --> 02:06:42,328
through and it's the intake that's

2966
02:06:39,328 --> 02:06:44,849
double duty and the only reason the only

2967
02:06:42,328 --> 02:06:46,828
reason I brought up the VB 2.5 Marcus as

2968
02:06:44,849 --> 02:06:50,248
you're telling me as you're saying the

2969
02:06:46,828 --> 02:06:52,038
future of vaporization see with what

2970
02:06:50,248 --> 02:06:55,380
they're doing it's something different

2971
02:06:52,038 --> 02:06:58,259
they're doing silicon nitride we've done

2972
02:06:55,380 --> 02:07:00,809
silicon carbide and what the industry

2973
02:06:58,260 --> 02:07:03,269
standard is right now quartz and before

2974
02:07:00,809 --> 02:07:05,248
quartz it was the highest ceramics and

2975
02:07:03,269 --> 02:07:07,918
before that it was the titanium and

2976
02:07:05,248 --> 02:07:11,429
before that it was the the hot knives

2977
02:07:07,918 --> 02:07:14,248
and before that it was stones so right

2978
02:07:11,429 --> 02:07:17,099
now we have you know if we haven't gone

2979
02:07:14,248 --> 02:07:20,248
through the full spectrum of materials

2980
02:07:17,099 --> 02:07:22,319
available what we can actually do so

2981
02:07:20,248 --> 02:07:27,269
right now what the industry is looking

2982
02:07:22,319 --> 02:07:29,038
at is quartz but I think II we have a

2983
02:07:27,269 --> 02:07:31,590
long way to go before we can actually

2984
02:07:29,038 --> 02:07:33,719
make the perfect a vaporizer where there

2985
02:07:31,590 --> 02:07:36,630
it is the nail whether it's an email

2986
02:07:33,719 --> 02:07:38,969
whether it's a handheld portable desktop

2987
02:07:36,630 --> 02:07:40,949
or whatever there's a long way to go

2988
02:07:38,969 --> 02:07:43,828
before we even come to the perfect

2989
02:07:40,948 --> 02:07:46,348
vaporize I think I think that quartz is

2990
02:07:43,828 --> 02:07:47,998
gonna be the the preferred material for

2991
02:07:46,349 --> 02:07:52,078
a long time and let me tell you why I

2992
02:07:47,998 --> 02:07:54,510
think that glass is always you know been

2993
02:07:52,078 --> 02:07:56,609
the ideal thing for the consumer and

2994
02:07:54,510 --> 02:07:58,708
they started with metal pipes they moved

2995
02:07:56,609 --> 02:08:00,868
the glass pipes you see a noticeable

2996
02:07:58,708 --> 02:08:03,809
difference moving from a metal pipe to a

2997
02:08:00,868 --> 02:08:05,279
glass pipe and then you know it's just

2998
02:08:03,809 --> 02:08:07,449
kind of the same thing happening through

2999
02:08:05,279 --> 02:08:09,939
the dabbing culture now but now you

3000
02:08:07,449 --> 02:08:11,529
a material of glass the quartz that can

3001
02:08:09,939 --> 02:08:14,679
withstand the thermal shock that the

3002
02:08:11,529 --> 02:08:18,579
process dabbing undergoes and so you get

3003
02:08:14,680 --> 02:08:21,670
that glass flavor and it it's it's a

3004
02:08:18,579 --> 02:08:24,359
hard material to beat the reason why

3005
02:08:21,670 --> 02:08:28,090
it's not kind of favorable to to these

3006
02:08:24,359 --> 02:08:30,880
vaporization electronic production

3007
02:08:28,090 --> 02:08:33,220
scenarios is because it's just got such

3008
02:08:30,880 --> 02:08:34,779
a low or such a different thermal

3009
02:08:33,220 --> 02:08:37,840
expansion rate than all these other

3010
02:08:34,779 --> 02:08:39,579
materials so you try and you try and put

3011
02:08:37,840 --> 02:08:42,520
it with something like a heating element

3012
02:08:39,579 --> 02:08:44,710
or you like even consumers will wrap an

3013
02:08:42,520 --> 02:08:48,520
email coil around the Banger to try and

3014
02:08:44,710 --> 02:08:50,170
make you know a quartz email banger but

3015
02:08:48,520 --> 02:08:52,900
it'll end up breaking their banger

3016
02:08:50,170 --> 02:08:54,579
because the the coil expands and then it

3017
02:08:52,899 --> 02:08:56,409
shifts a little bit while they're using

3018
02:08:54,579 --> 02:08:58,329
it and it's not on the same way and then

3019
02:08:56,409 --> 02:09:01,119
when it cools down it's now pinching the

3020
02:08:58,329 --> 02:09:04,439
glass and and it breaks it and so quartz

3021
02:09:01,119 --> 02:09:06,340
is is not a very friendly material to to

3022
02:09:04,439 --> 02:09:10,960
manufacture with when you're trying to

3023
02:09:06,340 --> 02:09:13,270
turn it into a heating element but all

3024
02:09:10,960 --> 02:09:16,810
that being said you know with with the

3025
02:09:13,270 --> 02:09:19,480
community where it's at right now I

3026
02:09:16,810 --> 02:09:21,250
don't think that any of these other

3027
02:09:19,479 --> 02:09:23,189
materials might be great and they might

3028
02:09:21,250 --> 02:09:26,380
be suitable but I don't see any of them

3029
02:09:23,189 --> 02:09:28,599
surpassing quartz and we were talking

3030
02:09:26,380 --> 02:09:31,210
about silicon nitride you know I have

3031
02:09:28,600 --> 02:09:33,070
concerns about silicon nitride I mean I

3032
02:09:31,210 --> 02:09:35,170
guess it depends on the application that

3033
02:09:33,069 --> 02:09:37,059
it's going to be used in but I mean even

3034
02:09:35,170 --> 02:09:39,220
on the Wikipedia page that I pulled up

3035
02:09:37,060 --> 02:09:42,160
right here it says main hazards when

3036
02:09:39,220 --> 02:09:45,000
heated decomposition silicon nitride may

3037
02:09:42,159 --> 02:09:47,349
emit toxic fumes of ammonia and ozone

3038
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:52,329
contact with acids may generate

3039
02:09:47,350 --> 02:09:54,970
flammable hydrogen gas so um we got to

3040
02:09:52,329 --> 02:09:58,689
kind of be careful which materials were

3041
02:09:54,970 --> 02:10:01,210
touting is as being superior I mean if

3042
02:09:58,689 --> 02:10:03,339
if someone's making an L out of this and

3043
02:10:01,210 --> 02:10:06,760
someone comes along and hits it with a

3044
02:10:03,340 --> 02:10:08,619
hydrogen torch or even a map gas torch

3045
02:10:06,760 --> 02:10:10,630
or even if the class blower decides

3046
02:10:08,619 --> 02:10:12,189
they're going to use their last one for

3047
02:10:10,630 --> 02:10:18,340
to heat it up you're going to have a

3048
02:10:12,189 --> 02:10:20,359
product issue and so I usually feel

3049
02:10:18,340 --> 02:10:22,819
comfortable if we're just a fraction of

3050
02:10:20,359 --> 02:10:26,989
that the decomposition temperature did

3051
02:10:22,819 --> 02:10:30,319
they name what it was degree right here

3052
02:10:26,989 --> 02:10:35,149
it says that the says that the melting

3053
02:10:30,319 --> 02:10:40,670
point is 1900 Celsius which is extremely

3054
02:10:35,149 --> 02:10:43,639
hot but that is probably not taking into

3055
02:10:40,670 --> 02:10:45,500
consideration that the stuff that's

3056
02:10:43,640 --> 02:10:46,789
going to be going on to it like if

3057
02:10:45,500 --> 02:10:49,430
you're burning contaminants on the

3058
02:10:46,789 --> 02:10:54,350
surface that could make it decompose

3059
02:10:49,430 --> 02:10:55,100
exceedingly lower temperatures so that's

3060
02:10:54,350 --> 02:10:58,820
interesting

3061
02:10:55,100 --> 02:11:02,840
I think quartz is a perfect material the

3062
02:10:58,819 --> 02:11:06,259
silicon carbide that Gary's using in the

3063
02:11:02,840 --> 02:11:09,710
up tech I see as necessary because it's

3064
02:11:06,260 --> 02:11:13,460
a very porous and bumpy material and the

3065
02:11:09,710 --> 02:11:16,489
whole point of these these little dab

3066
02:11:13,460 --> 02:11:20,239
pens is just kind of suck the oil up

3067
02:11:16,489 --> 02:11:22,460
into the coil by wicking and oil will

3068
02:11:20,239 --> 02:11:25,369
wick up a surface that is rough really

3069
02:11:22,460 --> 02:11:27,409
easily and fast and that will keep the

3070
02:11:25,369 --> 02:11:30,939
coil nice and moist

3071
02:11:27,409 --> 02:11:33,529
and and then the coil won't get hot if

3072
02:11:30,939 --> 02:11:35,149
when we through quartz into the bottom

3073
02:11:33,529 --> 02:11:36,199
and and gary has done it too and a lot

3074
02:11:35,149 --> 02:11:38,269
of people swear by it

3075
02:11:36,199 --> 02:11:40,309
when you put quartz as the core of the

3076
02:11:38,270 --> 02:11:42,730
heating element well it's slick and it

3077
02:11:40,310 --> 02:11:45,110
doesn't wick the oil so much and

3078
02:11:42,729 --> 02:11:49,969
actually not at all you have to often

3079
02:11:45,109 --> 02:11:51,769
with a quartz pipe you have to like do

3080
02:11:49,970 --> 02:11:55,369
this to it to get the oil to actually

3081
02:11:51,770 --> 02:11:59,690
flow under the heater I get what I think

3082
02:11:55,369 --> 02:12:01,519
is a harsh sharp over heated hit and I

3083
02:11:59,689 --> 02:12:04,669
believe it's because quartz on its own

3084
02:12:01,520 --> 02:12:11,720
can't be a wick it's so well so as much

3085
02:12:04,670 --> 02:12:14,000
as silicon carbide can but I think that

3086
02:12:11,720 --> 02:12:15,860
we I mean I think we should all test

3087
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:19,010
this especially if we helped each other

3088
02:12:15,859 --> 02:12:20,960
we should pay for the testing for a lot

3089
02:12:19,010 --> 02:12:23,989
of these materials directly and come up

3090
02:12:20,960 --> 02:12:26,840
with what could be a meaningful test but

3091
02:12:23,989 --> 02:12:28,639
we all of us are cut are pretty much in

3092
02:12:26,840 --> 02:12:31,400
the safe zone when we're at just a

3093
02:12:28,640 --> 02:12:33,829
fraction like a third of the temperature

3094
02:12:31,399 --> 02:12:34,279
needed to like break the material down

3095
02:12:33,829 --> 02:12:37,099
or

3096
02:12:34,279 --> 02:12:40,009
melt it or to even make it move or to

3097
02:12:37,099 --> 02:12:41,538
make it short life with Gary I know with

3098
02:12:40,010 --> 02:12:44,179
up tech he's concerned about these

3099
02:12:41,538 --> 02:12:46,340
things lasting for a long time so it

3100
02:12:44,179 --> 02:12:48,050
kind of goes hand in hand that when you

3101
02:12:46,340 --> 02:12:49,699
make a product and you figure out how to

3102
02:12:48,050 --> 02:12:51,349
make it last a long time that's usually

3103
02:12:49,698 --> 02:12:55,158
figuring out how to make it don't break

3104
02:12:51,349 --> 02:12:57,050
down even a little bit during normal use

3105
02:12:55,158 --> 02:12:59,359
or even a lot of use these things should

3106
02:12:57,050 --> 02:13:01,250
be made for heavy dabbers to use them

3107
02:12:59,359 --> 02:13:03,439
forever and they shouldn't fail on them

3108
02:13:01,250 --> 02:13:06,260
or else we keep you know we keep working

3109
02:13:03,439 --> 02:13:08,479
on it let me clarify I was definitely

3110
02:13:06,260 --> 02:13:11,599
kind of speaking about materials that

3111
02:13:08,479 --> 02:13:15,408
are gonna be helping flare oh wow yeah

3112
02:13:11,599 --> 02:13:17,360
yeah so that's kind of where my product

3113
02:13:15,408 --> 02:13:20,210
specialty is right now as we've moved

3114
02:13:17,359 --> 02:13:22,880
away from electronic assemblies and

3115
02:13:20,210 --> 02:13:25,609
things of that nature we folk einde of

3116
02:13:22,880 --> 02:13:27,170
more of a material science I'll focus on

3117
02:13:25,609 --> 02:13:32,118
that over here now with between the

3118
02:13:27,170 --> 02:13:33,649
materials and anything now so oh you're

3119
02:13:32,118 --> 02:13:35,839
talking about flame because I would see

3120
02:13:33,649 --> 02:13:38,089
you as an electronics guy but it's funny

3121
02:13:35,840 --> 02:13:40,760
cuz uh we've been playing around with

3122
02:13:38,090 --> 02:13:42,650
flame because it's kind of a new to us

3123
02:13:40,760 --> 02:13:44,119
because we've been around electronics so

3124
02:13:42,649 --> 02:13:50,118
much and sometimes it's fun to hear the

3125
02:13:44,118 --> 02:13:52,158
sound of a torch I mean the point of

3126
02:13:50,118 --> 02:13:54,139
your email and all of our products is

3127
02:13:52,158 --> 02:13:55,578
you can't hear vaporizing happening in

3128
02:13:54,139 --> 02:13:57,078
the next room and that's kind of nice

3129
02:13:55,578 --> 02:14:02,658
sometimes when you don't want the whole

3130
02:13:57,078 --> 02:14:05,149
house to know about it these materials

3131
02:14:02,658 --> 02:14:08,538
guys you know will be I think the future

3132
02:14:05,149 --> 02:14:10,308
will hold the development of the

3133
02:14:08,538 --> 02:14:12,859
materials to where we find that there

3134
02:14:10,309 --> 02:14:14,929
truly are best of all worlds if anyone's

3135
02:14:12,859 --> 02:14:16,908
dove into the Technical Ceramics space

3136
02:14:14,929 --> 02:14:19,670
they're doing all kinds of crazy things

3137
02:14:16,908 --> 02:14:21,649
I mean combining quartz dust with

3138
02:14:19,670 --> 02:14:22,760
various ceramic components to creating

3139
02:14:21,649 --> 02:14:24,888
quartz ceramics

3140
02:14:22,760 --> 02:14:28,190
they're absolutely happy and middle

3141
02:14:24,889 --> 02:14:30,980
ground that that I think we will get to

3142
02:14:28,189 --> 02:14:34,339
just a matter of pushing the the

3143
02:14:30,979 --> 02:14:36,348
material science no I understand about

3144
02:14:34,340 --> 02:14:37,788
that mark well what task was talking

3145
02:14:36,349 --> 02:14:40,940
about it and I think where we got the

3146
02:14:37,788 --> 02:14:42,380
mix up is task was talking about an open

3147
02:14:40,939 --> 02:14:44,988
flame where you gotta heat it up to a

3148
02:14:42,380 --> 02:14:46,550
high temperature then when it that could

3149
02:14:44,988 --> 02:14:48,439
break it down but what

3150
02:14:46,550 --> 02:14:51,680
Linus and the vapor brothers are doing

3151
02:14:48,439 --> 02:14:53,149
with that silicon nitride is it's it's a

3152
02:14:51,680 --> 02:14:57,050
control temperature where it doesn't

3153
02:14:53,149 --> 02:15:00,039
reach you know 2,000 degrees Celsius is

3154
02:14:57,050 --> 02:15:02,270
no way and what he what he explained was

3155
02:15:00,039 --> 02:15:06,229
and that's the thing I love about the

3156
02:15:02,270 --> 02:15:09,830
via the VB 2.5 is is it doesn't paper

3157
02:15:06,229 --> 02:15:11,779
ice on the heating element it vaporized

3158
02:15:09,829 --> 02:15:13,579
like maybe what was it a half a

3159
02:15:11,779 --> 02:15:16,880
millimeter you said above it right in

3160
02:15:13,579 --> 02:15:18,949
the air that's my theory I mean this is

3161
02:15:16,880 --> 02:15:20,869
the heating element but that helps us to

3162
02:15:18,949 --> 02:15:23,029
not have such a hot heating element if

3163
02:15:20,869 --> 02:15:25,579
you separate the heating element in

3164
02:15:23,029 --> 02:15:27,019
space between the helmet and what you're

3165
02:15:25,579 --> 02:15:28,939
vaporizing you have to deal with a very

3166
02:15:27,020 --> 02:15:31,610
high temperature that's like what task

3167
02:15:28,939 --> 02:15:35,119
was talking about with he's he you need

3168
02:15:31,609 --> 02:15:37,099
a really good heater to heat an email

3169
02:15:35,119 --> 02:15:38,210
because there's a little distance it it

3170
02:15:37,100 --> 02:15:40,520
needs to run at a very high temperature

3171
02:15:38,210 --> 02:15:43,939
so the email can run at the temperature

3172
02:15:40,520 --> 02:15:45,830
you want but as you're as you mentioned

3173
02:15:43,939 --> 02:15:47,899
it's a fraction of a millimeter the

3174
02:15:45,829 --> 02:15:52,880
distance between the the heating surface

3175
02:15:47,899 --> 02:15:56,389
and the dabs so I'm I'm so that's a very

3176
02:15:52,880 --> 02:15:58,750
small distance but at least the dabs

3177
02:15:56,390 --> 02:16:03,020
aren't settling down into the heater and

3178
02:15:58,750 --> 02:16:05,239
and and settling down into the material

3179
02:16:03,020 --> 02:16:07,720
and then turning black and and smoking

3180
02:16:05,239 --> 02:16:10,039
they're they're evaporating

3181
02:16:07,720 --> 02:16:12,140
theoretically in the air right above

3182
02:16:10,039 --> 02:16:14,750
it's the same effect as when you turn a

3183
02:16:12,140 --> 02:16:16,490
skillet on your oven up so high that

3184
02:16:14,750 --> 02:16:18,680
when you throw water in it it bounces

3185
02:16:16,489 --> 02:16:22,279
because it's being held up by its own

3186
02:16:18,680 --> 02:16:24,140
evaporating but its own vapor and that

3187
02:16:22,279 --> 02:16:26,869
effect they call it like Leidenfrost

3188
02:16:24,140 --> 02:16:29,539
effect they need a more catchy name for

3189
02:16:26,869 --> 02:16:31,039
that by the way the Leidenfrost effect

3190
02:16:29,539 --> 02:16:33,888
is what we were going for with this

3191
02:16:31,039 --> 02:16:37,370
device see that's what I was trying to

3192
02:16:33,888 --> 02:16:39,558
say is there's right now the industries

3193
02:16:37,370 --> 02:16:41,389
set on quartz we don't know what the

3194
02:16:39,558 --> 02:16:44,359
industry is gonna be said on five years

3195
02:16:41,388 --> 02:16:46,549
from now it's just gonna is its fluidic

3196
02:16:44,360 --> 02:16:50,389
right now because right we don't have

3197
02:16:46,549 --> 02:16:52,909
the perfect answer to any of this no she

3198
02:16:50,388 --> 02:16:55,429
says nobody comes most how it happens

3199
02:16:52,909 --> 02:16:57,229
it's just people like what they like and

3200
02:16:55,429 --> 02:16:58,909
whatever blows up blows up because

3201
02:16:57,229 --> 02:16:59,779
that's what people like and you hope

3202
02:16:58,909 --> 02:17:01,700
that what they

3203
02:16:59,780 --> 02:17:04,700
is actually the thing that is actually

3204
02:17:01,700 --> 02:17:06,500
you know better for them more along the

3205
02:17:04,700 --> 02:17:08,179
lines of preserving terpene and

3206
02:17:06,500 --> 02:17:11,360
cannabinoid profiles rather than

3207
02:17:08,179 --> 02:17:14,269
absolutely destroying them and yeah

3208
02:17:11,360 --> 02:17:16,579
there's more information go ahead yeah I

3209
02:17:14,269 --> 02:17:18,229
was just saying I mean I'm obviously a

3210
02:17:16,579 --> 02:17:20,420
big believer in science and technology

3211
02:17:18,229 --> 02:17:22,968
and I I love all the things that it's

3212
02:17:20,420 --> 02:17:24,860
done for us not just for the cannabis

3213
02:17:22,968 --> 02:17:27,709
consumption side but for everything in

3214
02:17:24,860 --> 02:17:30,079
general but you know like my good ol

3215
02:17:27,709 --> 02:17:33,379
buddy mark likes to tell me Whole Foods

3216
02:17:30,079 --> 02:17:36,579
are always better than eating EAS

3217
02:17:33,379 --> 02:17:39,049
metrics or any of those meal replacement

3218
02:17:36,579 --> 02:17:41,000
protein shakes that I used to scarf down

3219
02:17:39,049 --> 02:17:42,829
at his place all the time and you know

3220
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:44,929
sometimes I always think back man

3221
02:17:42,829 --> 02:17:47,989
are we over complicating this because

3222
02:17:44,929 --> 02:17:50,058
the plant in its natural form sun-grown

3223
02:17:47,989 --> 02:17:51,920
it's just so awesome and I think bubble

3224
02:17:50,058 --> 02:17:54,439
man said it best you know if it feels

3225
02:17:51,920 --> 02:17:56,120
good if it feels right then maybe that

3226
02:17:54,440 --> 02:17:58,790
is the right way and I don't want to get

3227
02:17:56,120 --> 02:18:01,280
too much into hippie dippie territory

3228
02:17:58,790 --> 02:18:03,889
but you know it does feel that way like

3229
02:18:01,280 --> 02:18:06,860
as I started making all these technical

3230
02:18:03,888 --> 02:18:08,629
improvements to our device you know and

3231
02:18:06,860 --> 02:18:12,319
then I just thought about you know the

3232
02:18:08,629 --> 02:18:14,869
first vaporizer I use the heat gun and I

3233
02:18:12,319 --> 02:18:16,549
really thought man the heat gun you know

3234
02:18:14,870 --> 02:18:17,929
I haven't used it for ten years but I do

3235
02:18:16,549 --> 02:18:20,299
feel like if I use that right now I

3236
02:18:17,929 --> 02:18:22,610
think it would be comparable to a lot of

3237
02:18:20,299 --> 02:18:24,229
the unit's out on the market still you

3238
02:18:22,610 --> 02:18:26,389
know so I think there is maybe going

3239
02:18:24,229 --> 02:18:28,159
back to basics and it does seem like the

3240
02:18:26,388 --> 02:18:30,159
world is kind of going back to basics

3241
02:18:28,159 --> 02:18:33,260
again and maybe that is the best way to

3242
02:18:30,159 --> 02:18:35,239
ingest the can of cannabinoids and I

3243
02:18:33,260 --> 02:18:37,219
hate to eat and run or not eat and run

3244
02:18:35,239 --> 02:18:39,979
but it's time for me to take my kids to

3245
02:18:37,218 --> 02:18:42,500
go eat so I have to go run now and I

3246
02:18:39,979 --> 02:18:46,819
appreciate being on the show Marcus

02:19:21,389 --> 02:19:26,569
ignited with it you know he's deadly my

3262
02:19:23,610 --> 02:19:28,860
words think for his vaporizer now

3263
02:19:26,569 --> 02:19:31,289
yeah I've been hitting it the whole time

3264
02:19:28,860 --> 02:19:33,840
he has these little quartz rods that you

3265
02:19:31,290 --> 02:19:35,940
failure your concentrate with and then

3266
02:19:33,840 --> 02:19:38,250
you just slide it right into the tube of

3267
02:19:35,940 --> 02:19:39,750
the of the piece the bomb goes right

3268
02:19:38,250 --> 02:19:42,569
over top but yeah these little quartz

3269
02:19:39,750 --> 02:19:44,700
rods give I mean they dab delicious one

3270
02:19:42,569 --> 02:19:46,979
of them I think the ones before I tell

3271
02:19:44,700 --> 02:19:48,750
you about this which is crazy I'll tell

3272
02:19:46,979 --> 02:19:51,840
you one thing about this when I put like

3273
02:19:48,750 --> 02:19:54,180
a drop of pure cannabis drive terpenes

3274
02:19:51,840 --> 02:19:57,479
into this thing with nothing else right

3275
02:19:54,180 --> 02:19:59,970
and turn the unit down and drop the

3276
02:19:57,479 --> 02:20:02,459
quartz rod into the glass tube that's

3277
02:19:59,969 --> 02:20:04,739
been heating the air up just the way it

3278
02:20:02,459 --> 02:20:07,439
seems to heat is one of the most

3279
02:20:04,739 --> 02:20:09,899
preserved pure terpene drips I've ever

3280
02:20:07,440 --> 02:20:11,851
taken and I've done like 20 30 in a row

3281
02:20:09,899 --> 02:20:15,750
like done some gauntlets with it it's

3282
02:20:11,851 --> 02:20:17,489
actually astounding how how much it

3283
02:20:15,750 --> 02:20:19,950
preserves the rip it definitely hits

3284
02:20:17,489 --> 02:20:24,810
table and we envision really really

3285
02:20:19,950 --> 02:20:26,909
efficient Annina ya know it's I mean I

3286

or three different things going that I

3290
02:20:33,390 --> 02:20:38,969
can that I can rip at a time just

3291
02:20:36,060 --> 02:20:43,799
because I love a little bit of variety

3292
02:20:38,969 --> 02:20:46,229
in my life do you uh you use torture

3293

3300
02:21:00,239 --> 02:21:04,351
all just sitting here I used them at

3301
02:21:02,521 --> 02:21:06,480
different times but for a while like

3302
02:21:04,351 --> 02:21:09,360
maybe a month or two I was just torching

3303
02:21:06,479 --> 02:21:12,119
I got into torching I came way late to

3304
02:21:09,360 --> 02:21:14,340
the torch game and I definitely am NOT a

3305
02:21:12,120 --> 02:21:17,010
fan of like knocking it over and burning

3306
02:21:14,340 --> 02:21:19,680
my car seat or burning my friends arm or

3307
02:21:17,010 --> 02:21:21,840
all the sort of like non like the torch

3308
02:21:19,680 --> 02:21:24,610
etiquette that is that not yet exactly

3309
02:21:21,840 --> 02:21:27,159
dudes back

3310
02:21:24,610 --> 02:21:28,391
I know and those burns we were talking

3311
02:21:27,159 --> 02:21:29,831
about it the other day with a friend the

3312
02:21:28,390 --> 02:21:32,770
burns that you get on the inside of your

3313
02:21:29,831 --> 02:21:35,050
arm they look like like like you're a

3314
02:21:32,771 --> 02:21:37,690
mess junkie or something I mean they

3315
02:21:35,050 --> 02:21:39,550
never go away they just are there for

3316
02:21:37,690 --> 02:21:42,551
like years

3317
02:21:39,550 --> 02:21:45,180
very good they don't hurt right when

3318
02:21:42,550 --> 02:21:47,680
it's hot enough you can't feel it I

3319
02:21:45,181 --> 02:21:49,421
tried I tried to fight the torch you

3320
02:21:47,681 --> 02:21:52,421
know I tried to do the whole email thing

3321
02:21:49,421 --> 02:21:55,211
but then the torch just came back full

3322
02:21:52,421 --> 02:21:57,940
swing then like you know for being my

3323
02:21:55,210 --> 02:21:59,590
market it did ya know the torch is

3324
02:21:57,940 --> 02:22:01,390
definitely popular like I said I'm a

3325
02:21:59,591 --> 02:22:03,881
quiver guy I'm definitely not trying to

3326
02:22:01,390 --> 02:22:05,560
be all like anti any particular one

3327
02:22:03,880 --> 02:22:09,939
thing I'll just you know I might not

3328
02:22:05,560 --> 02:22:11,710
smoke BHO or co2 oils but at the same

3329
02:22:09,940 --> 02:22:13,360
time I don't make it my mission in life

3330
02:22:11,710 --> 02:22:19,120
to make sure that nobody else does

3331
02:22:13,360 --> 02:22:22,950
either maybe a little bit more more like

3332
02:22:19,120 --> 02:22:26,859
that when you met me at oh hey Mark yeah

3333
02:22:22,950 --> 02:22:28,780
Compassion's market do you time it you

3334
02:22:26,860 --> 02:22:30,780
set your timer and you know you won't

3335
02:22:28,780 --> 02:22:33,700
let anybody touch it on us it's gone the

3336
02:22:30,780 --> 02:22:36,280
well you know what that's sort of be

3337
02:22:33,700 --> 02:22:38,171
really super new [ __ ] eventually you

3338
02:22:36,280 --> 02:22:41,501
just know your nail and you know how

3339
02:22:38,171 --> 02:22:44,291
long to hit it for and you know how long

3340
02:22:41,501 --> 02:22:46,331
it cools but the risk is quite you know

3341
02:22:44,290 --> 02:22:49,000
you use your wrist to tell how hot it is

3342
02:22:46,331 --> 02:22:50,800
can also really for me I'm avoiding one

3343
02:22:49,001 --> 02:22:56,440
thing in one thing alone with the torch

3344
02:22:50,800 --> 02:22:59,439
jazzing my banger who burn and black in

3345
02:22:56,440 --> 02:23:00,851
my hit and it also tastes like ooh like

3346
02:22:59,440 --> 02:23:03,489
that's something completely different

3347
02:23:00,851 --> 02:23:05,110
from the beautiful tasting grip I would

3348
02:23:03,489 --> 02:23:08,261
have gotten had I just allowed it to

3349
02:23:05,110 --> 02:23:09,909
stay in an oil like when I'm when it's

3350
02:23:08,261 --> 02:23:12,851
still in an oil I feel it like I

3351
02:23:09,909 --> 02:23:15,040
vaporize it and when it's Chaz my banger

3352
02:23:12,851 --> 02:23:18,489
and I need to get the DC glass cleaner

3353
02:23:15,040 --> 02:23:20,140
out that I feel that it's either but I

3354
02:23:18,489 --> 02:23:21,729
got to get on the timer like thank you

3355
02:23:20,140 --> 02:23:23,710
say it's super-new [ __ ] well here's

3356
02:23:21,729 --> 02:23:26,800
super new number one right over here

3357
02:23:23,710 --> 02:23:29,831
then just because it's like you know I'm

3358
02:23:26,800 --> 02:23:31,689
I'm uh you know I'm waiting a minute for

3359
02:23:29,831 --> 02:23:33,581
a banger to cool down is a long time to

3360
02:23:31,690 --> 02:23:36,540
wait and I get distracted you know I

3361
02:23:33,581 --> 02:23:38,729
checked my phone I see a notification

3362
02:23:36,540 --> 02:23:41,190
and sooner or later I've missed my

3363
02:23:38,729 --> 02:23:44,069
window so I've got a timer with it with

3364
02:23:41,190 --> 02:23:45,870
the alarm so it always goes off I always

3365
02:23:44,069 --> 02:23:47,279
get it at the right time and that's

3366
02:23:45,870 --> 02:23:50,160
that's really kind of what it's about

3367
02:23:47,280 --> 02:23:52,800
it's more about a discipline than than

3368
02:23:50,159 --> 02:23:54,600
being a new no offense or anything but I

3369
02:23:52,799 --> 02:23:56,969
know none taken

3370
02:23:54,600 --> 02:23:59,970
I was using it more like as a joke but

3371
02:23:56,969 --> 02:24:01,649
in reality I don't heat up for for that

3372
02:23:59,969 --> 02:24:03,840
long I don't have to cool my nail for a

3373
02:24:01,649 --> 02:24:06,239
minute because I don't take monster dab

3374
02:24:03,840 --> 02:24:08,430
see I take many many many like smaller

3375
02:24:06,239 --> 02:24:11,309
dabs so when I put a dab on a nail

3376
02:24:08,430 --> 02:24:14,220
it's not cooling the nail down so much

3377
02:24:11,309 --> 02:24:16,559
that I have to like heat it up real hot

3378
02:24:14,219 --> 02:24:18,809
for a minute and bring it down or heat

3379
02:24:16,559 --> 02:24:20,639
it up for 20 seconds with the torch in

3380
02:24:18,809 --> 02:24:22,889
order to bring it down also I'm hitting

3381
02:24:20,639 --> 02:24:25,920
these giant [ __ ] you know these

3382
02:24:22,889 --> 02:24:28,170
things are big he's different I got a

3383
02:24:25,920 --> 02:24:30,840
bunch of these JP ones and I got like a

3384
02:24:28,170 --> 02:24:33,600
I think DC sent me a double XL they're

3385
02:24:30,840 --> 02:24:35,280
all the ones I have are big so I become

3386
02:24:33,600 --> 02:24:37,170
a noob instantly if I hit someone's

3387
02:24:35,280 --> 02:24:39,810
small little banger I mean that I need

3388
02:24:37,170 --> 02:24:43,440
the timer immediately great my own

3389
02:24:39,809 --> 02:24:45,239
banger I'm pretty good well then the

3390
02:24:43,440 --> 02:24:47,579
these new ones that we put out there

3391
02:24:45,239 --> 02:24:49,680
they're a little different to the the

3392
02:24:47,579 --> 02:24:52,440
quartz material has a different thermal

3393
02:24:49,680 --> 02:24:54,540
properties than traditional quartz so

3394
02:24:52,440 --> 02:24:57,021
you know a twenty second heat up would

3395
02:24:54,540 --> 02:24:59,760
result in about a sixty second cooldown

3396
02:24:57,021 --> 02:25:01,771
yeah that's generally what I see with

3397
02:24:59,760 --> 02:25:04,021
some of these larger ones I have now I'm

3398
02:25:01,771 --> 02:25:07,140
like more like heated for maybe ten

3399
02:25:04,021 --> 02:25:09,090
seconds and just with my wrist it's you

3400
02:25:07,139 --> 02:25:11,010
know not very long that I wait twenty

3401
02:25:09,090 --> 02:25:13,500
five seconds or something close to

3402
02:25:11,010 --> 02:25:16,380
thirty seconds and then I'm have my

3403
02:25:13,500 --> 02:25:18,569
little dab and it definitely doesn't

3404
02:25:16,379 --> 02:25:21,059
work as good as having your nail plugged

3405
02:25:18,569 --> 02:25:22,850
in or having your timer and doing it

3406
02:25:21,059 --> 02:25:26,219
exactly the same amount each time

3407
02:25:22,850 --> 02:25:29,220
alright just that's it's all what you

3408
02:25:26,219 --> 02:25:30,869
choose in the end for sure you guys

3409
02:25:29,219 --> 02:25:33,090
believe in carb caps

3410
02:25:30,870 --> 02:25:36,480
you do you believe in tight carb caps

3411
02:25:33,090 --> 02:25:39,469
and really pull in a vacuum I like the

3412
02:25:36,479 --> 02:25:42,829
opportunity to have that I got these

3413
02:25:39,469 --> 02:25:46,109
puke and Eagle ones that fit into quartz

3414
02:25:42,829 --> 02:25:48,271
bowls like similar to the one mr. hotbox

3415
02:25:46,110 --> 02:25:50,100
has it fits very tight and when I put my

3416
02:25:48,271 --> 02:25:52,050
finger on the hole

3417
02:25:50,100 --> 02:25:54,690
there's no pulling through it anymore

3418
02:25:52,049 --> 02:25:57,059
you know it's I like the ability to have

3419
02:25:54,690 --> 02:25:58,470
it so I can do that if I want it but I

3420
02:25:57,059 --> 02:26:02,129
definitely don't want to hit my hole rip

3421
02:25:58,469 --> 02:26:04,529
like that every time I'll tell you when

3422
02:26:02,129 --> 02:26:07,319
we first put out our first carb cap back

3423
02:26:04,530 --> 02:26:10,620
in I think it was some 2012 might've in

3424
02:26:07,319 --> 02:26:12,449
2013 again I'm bad with dates but I was

3425
02:26:10,620 --> 02:26:15,510
under the impression that you know the

3426
02:26:12,450 --> 02:26:19,230
vacuum pressure played a substantial

3427
02:26:15,510 --> 02:26:22,290
role in the carb cap but as I've kind of

3428
02:26:19,229 --> 02:26:24,329
moved along and grown to understand it

3429
02:26:22,290 --> 02:26:26,100
better I think that it's good to have a

3430
02:26:24,329 --> 02:26:27,510
good seal so that your carb caps

3431
02:26:26,100 --> 02:26:29,250
functioning the way it's supposed to

3432
02:26:27,510 --> 02:26:30,870
functioning like you don't want air to

3433
02:26:29,250 --> 02:26:32,940
be coming around the sides where it's

3434
02:26:30,870 --> 02:26:35,040
not supposed to be going so a good seal

3435
02:26:32,940 --> 02:26:37,920
is important but I don't think that the

3436
02:26:35,040 --> 02:26:40,950
vacuum pressure placed so much into the

3437
02:26:37,920 --> 02:26:44,129
functionality of it as much as just

3438
02:26:40,950 --> 02:26:46,829
having a constant flow of new air to mix

3439
02:26:44,129 --> 02:26:48,859
into the oil and having the air thin the

3440
02:26:46,829 --> 02:26:52,469
oil out and by thinning the puddle out

3441
02:26:48,860 --> 02:26:55,230
it vaporizes easily because the depths

3442
02:26:52,469 --> 02:26:58,949
of the puddle is less and when you have

3443
02:26:55,229 --> 02:27:01,559
when you have a deeper puddle it's under

3444
02:26:58,950 --> 02:27:04,230
more surface pressure at the bottom and

3445
02:27:01,559 --> 02:27:08,100
it requires more energy to you know to

3446
02:27:04,229 --> 02:27:10,289
create nucleating or boiling and so by

3447
02:27:08,100 --> 02:27:12,870
thinning out the oil it allows it to

3448
02:27:10,290 --> 02:27:15,120
vaporize at least that's where my

3449
02:27:12,870 --> 02:27:17,820
personal understanding of it is that

3450
02:27:15,120 --> 02:27:20,070
right now and and I may be wrong but I

3451
02:27:17,819 --> 02:27:21,809
don't take that the vacuum effect of the

3452
02:27:20,069 --> 02:27:24,209
carb cap has too much to play in the

3453
02:27:21,809 --> 02:27:26,539
functionality of it I wonder what mark

3454
02:27:24,209 --> 02:27:29,819
mark McCoy who has a lot of deep

3455
02:27:26,540 --> 02:27:32,340
understanding of certain physics here do

3456
02:27:29,819 --> 02:27:35,940
you have an opinion on do you think I

3457
02:27:32,340 --> 02:27:39,930
actually put quite a bit of effort into

3458
02:27:35,940 --> 02:27:42,569
this last went first the principal state

3459
02:27:39,930 --> 02:27:45,989
of the art dabbing gear kind of came

3460
02:27:42,569 --> 02:27:48,709
late to the game as well I've played

3461
02:27:45,989 --> 02:27:51,329
with torches I think that there is

3462
02:27:48,709 --> 02:27:53,969
something to be said about the thermal

3463
02:27:51,329 --> 02:27:55,469
gradient in your timing and that's one

3464
02:27:53,969 --> 02:27:57,239
thing that you know you don't have with

3465
02:27:55,469 --> 02:27:58,799
the emails at the present although I

3466
02:27:57,239 --> 02:28:02,309
think you may see some of that stuff in

3467
02:27:58,799 --> 02:28:03,689
the future and what I found is it's kind

3468
02:28:02,309 --> 02:28:06,510
of a combination it's

3469
02:28:03,690 --> 02:28:09,659
the vacuum and it's the cyclonic flow of

3470
02:28:06,511 --> 02:28:11,579
some carb caps that like TAS said

3471
02:28:09,659 --> 02:28:13,289
spreads it out it's just like when we're

3472
02:28:11,579 --> 02:28:15,630
vaporizing flowers you want to grind

3473
02:28:13,290 --> 02:28:17,370
them up so you have that surface area

3474
02:28:15,630 --> 02:28:19,350
you don't want to grind it up so fine so

3475
02:28:17,370 --> 02:28:20,910
that it cakes together and interferes

3476
02:28:19,351 --> 02:28:23,310
with the airflow but you want to grind

3477
02:28:20,909 --> 02:28:25,860
it up fine enough that you really are

3478
02:28:23,310 --> 02:28:29,159
exposing your your full bowl all those

3479
02:28:25,860 --> 02:28:31,530
particles to that nice convective flow

3480
02:28:29,159 --> 02:28:33,239
and eventually that that thermal

3481
02:28:31,530 --> 02:28:35,489
equilibrium when it's reached in there

3482
02:28:33,239 --> 02:28:38,970
so I think it's it's it's a combination

3483
02:28:35,489 --> 02:28:40,771
it's both the the vacuum and the the

3484
02:28:38,970 --> 02:28:42,930
airflow and what I've found is the

3485
02:28:40,771 --> 02:28:45,870
cyclonic flow that spins the oil around

3486
02:28:42,931 --> 02:28:48,329
in there is the most effective in terms

3487
02:28:45,870 --> 02:28:51,480
of being able to go to get a nice

3488
02:28:48,329 --> 02:28:53,579
fulfilling thick condensed vapor but at

3489
02:28:51,479 --> 02:28:56,779
the lowest tenth possible so you're

3490
02:28:53,579 --> 02:28:59,671
minimizing the denaturalization of the

3491
02:28:56,780 --> 02:29:01,290
important components really really

3492
02:28:59,671 --> 02:29:03,421
important with the terpenes you know the

3493
02:29:01,290 --> 02:29:04,591
terpenes he'll these are these are these

3494
02:29:03,421 --> 02:29:07,011
are solvents they're gonna vaporize

3495
02:29:04,591 --> 02:29:10,560
really quick they're very volatile and

3496
02:29:07,011 --> 02:29:12,181
if you want that full spectrum you want

3497
02:29:10,560 --> 02:29:14,220
to be at the lowest temperature you can

3498
02:29:12,181 --> 02:29:16,440
possibly be at and I find the cyclonic

3499
02:29:14,220 --> 02:29:19,409
vacuum is the way to do that I got

3500
02:29:16,440 --> 02:29:21,810
turned on to that actually as a pursuit

3501
02:29:19,409 --> 02:29:26,069
because we have had some customers use

3502
02:29:21,810 --> 02:29:27,989
our heat wands as cyclonic heated

3503
02:29:26,069 --> 02:29:30,511
cyclonic vacuum and we're just blown

3504
02:29:27,989 --> 02:29:33,149
away that they were dropping their heat

3505
02:29:30,511 --> 02:29:35,881
wand as a carb cap down on a banger and

3506
02:29:33,149 --> 02:29:38,011
able to go even lower temp because

3507
02:29:35,880 --> 02:29:40,229
they're getting vacuum that's spinning

3508
02:29:38,011 --> 02:29:42,601
the oil around that's already heated

3509
02:29:40,229 --> 02:29:44,970
because of course that vacuum is coming

3510
02:29:42,601 --> 02:29:47,431
from the air spinning around the hot

3511
02:29:44,970 --> 02:29:48,989
glass element of our wand and so we've

3512
02:29:47,431 --> 02:29:52,591
been playing with this we've got a

3513
02:29:48,989 --> 02:29:54,601
couple products in the R&amp;D pipe that

3514
02:29:52,591 --> 02:29:57,569
would allow people to go this route if

3515
02:29:54,601 --> 02:30:01,079
they already had a wand and also a carb

3516
02:29:57,569 --> 02:30:03,119
cap design that would would would really

3517
02:30:01,079 --> 02:30:05,310
help maximize this based upon the same

3518
02:30:03,120 --> 02:30:07,710
flow form physics we have in our in our

3519
02:30:05,310 --> 02:30:09,869
vaporization heat want that's

3520
02:30:07,709 --> 02:30:12,180
interesting it reminds me I had invited

3521
02:30:09,870 --> 02:30:15,160
Enrico today from the sublimator company

3522
02:30:12,181 --> 02:30:16,569
he also kind of tuned into the venturi

3523
02:30:15,159 --> 02:30:19,090
fact and he you know one of the things

3524
02:30:16,569 --> 02:30:21,940
that I came up with why his thing is so

3525
02:30:19,090 --> 02:30:23,860
ridiculous is because because it does

3526
02:30:21,940 --> 02:30:25,630
give just an insane like its it's a

3527
02:30:23,860 --> 02:30:27,250
little I don't mean ridiculous in a bad

3528
02:30:25,629 --> 02:30:29,079
way like I thought it was one of the

3529
02:30:27,250 --> 02:30:30,790
tastiest rips the first time I ever hit

3530
02:30:29,079 --> 02:30:32,049
it it was just kind of kind of blew me

3531
02:30:30,790 --> 02:30:33,970
away actually I couldn't really believe

3532
02:30:32,049 --> 02:30:35,619
it because it just was such a big

3533
02:30:33,969 --> 02:30:37,179
crazy-looking thing and I was like holy

3534
02:30:35,620 --> 02:30:38,590
[ __ ] I'm gonna burn my house down with

3535
02:30:37,180 --> 02:30:41,351
this thing he's like no no it's good

3536
02:30:38,590 --> 02:30:43,090
check it out and I I hit it and was

3537
02:30:41,351 --> 02:30:44,710
immediately blown away and then I

3538
02:30:43,090 --> 02:30:46,180
started hitting it when it wasn't when I

3539
02:30:44,709 --> 02:30:47,649
wasn't getting the hit and what I was

3540
02:30:46,180 --> 02:30:49,360
noticing was you can't take the heat

3541
02:30:47,649 --> 02:30:51,069
wand and put it on the bowl and have a

3542
02:30:49,360 --> 02:30:53,800
rip his bowl was like this big like

3543
02:30:51,069 --> 02:30:56,920
titanium bowl that you needed to heat up

3544
02:30:53,799 --> 02:30:58,779
with the wand so it was the same idea

3545
02:30:56,920 --> 02:31:00,790
when they were both heated up and I

3546
02:30:58,780 --> 02:31:03,250
spoke about this with the hotbox guys

3547
02:31:00,790 --> 02:31:05,710
recently who have this little this is an

3548
02:31:03,250 --> 02:31:07,930
electric nail vaporizer that you put the

3549
02:31:05,709 --> 02:31:08,619
coil over top of here it basically goes

3550
02:31:07,930 --> 02:31:11,319
like that

3551
02:31:08,620 --> 02:31:13,540
and then they have a little heated pan

3552
02:31:11,319 --> 02:31:15,340
here a little screen that fits right

3553
02:31:13,540 --> 02:31:18,450
into here and it sits on your on your

3554
02:31:15,340 --> 02:31:20,530
pipe it screws into like the base

3555
02:31:18,450 --> 02:31:22,900
electric nail this thing actually

3556
02:31:20,530 --> 02:31:24,070
[ __ ] works really good and I told

3557
02:31:22,899 --> 02:31:27,129
them right away I said you know if you

3558
02:31:24,069 --> 02:31:29,260
keep this warm inside the thing before

3559
02:31:27,129 --> 02:31:31,000
we hit it I bet you it gives away better

3560
02:31:29,260 --> 02:31:31,930
rip and he was like oh yeah we figured

3561
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:33,489
that out right away

3562
02:31:31,930 --> 02:31:35,140
so there's definitely something

3563
02:31:33,489 --> 02:31:36,610
important to be said about that like

3564
02:31:35,140 --> 02:31:38,289
when you're coming up with these designs

3565
02:31:36,610 --> 02:31:39,880
if you're an innovator listening to the

3566
02:31:38,290 --> 02:31:41,050
guys on the panel right now and you're

3567
02:31:39,879 --> 02:31:44,199
trying to come up with these unique

3568
02:31:41,049 --> 02:31:46,060
designs at least for vaporizing that you

3569
02:31:44,200 --> 02:31:48,970
know you can't just bring a component

3570
02:31:46,060 --> 02:31:51,219
that's totally cold into the mix or even

3571
02:31:48,969 --> 02:31:52,659
on the smallest level it really affects

3572
02:31:51,219 --> 02:31:54,939
the temperature of the surface that

3573
02:31:52,659 --> 02:31:57,610
you're dabbing off of or using to vape

3574
02:31:54,940 --> 02:31:59,140
off of and that in turn you know affects

3575
02:31:57,610 --> 02:32:01,870
everything in the end and you might just

3576
02:31:59,140 --> 02:32:04,180
miss that magic and I don't understand

3577
02:32:01,870 --> 02:32:06,670
all of the things you know to the level

3578
02:32:04,180 --> 02:32:08,890
that task and mark and the guys on the

3579
02:32:06,670 --> 02:32:10,690
panel are talking about but I definitely

3580
02:32:08,890 --> 02:32:12,520
get a good idea and I'm glad there's

3581
02:32:10,690 --> 02:32:15,010
people that are this passionate about it

3582
02:32:12,521 --> 02:32:18,280
paying extra attention to those very

3583
02:32:15,010 --> 02:32:21,510
subtle things to you know create the

3584
02:32:18,280 --> 02:32:24,070
nuances that make a great product great

3585
02:32:21,510 --> 02:32:27,139
you can't have a symphony with just the

3586
02:32:24,069 --> 02:32:30,889
bass no you can't

3587
02:32:27,139 --> 02:32:32,629
marked a quick question when you were

3588
02:32:30,889 --> 02:32:37,039
talking about the venturi effect and all

3589
02:32:32,629 --> 02:32:39,379
that have you ever come across the

3590
02:32:37,040 --> 02:32:42,770
notion have you ever thought about that

3591
02:32:39,379 --> 02:32:44,148
the less oxygen produces more vapor yeah

3592
02:32:42,770 --> 02:32:46,300
I mean I think that's another component

3593
02:32:44,148 --> 02:32:48,769
that's important to consider the vacuum

3594
02:32:46,299 --> 02:32:50,869
consideration I mean if you look at our

3595
02:32:48,770 --> 02:32:53,350
water pipes you know we we have we you

3596
02:32:50,870 --> 02:32:56,960
know back in the day when we started our

3597
02:32:53,350 --> 02:33:00,408
water pipes and bombs you know a bit

3598
02:32:56,959 --> 02:33:03,438
controversial in fact still to this day

3599
02:33:00,408 --> 02:33:05,090
some of my family members will jokingly

3600
02:33:03,439 --> 02:33:11,329
asked me if I still have that high-tech

3601
02:33:05,090 --> 02:33:15,079
bond company but if you say oh that's

3602
02:33:11,329 --> 02:33:17,059
high-tech you asked me am I still

3603
02:33:15,079 --> 02:33:17,689
smoking I'm like no I'm a pricing what

3604
02:33:17,059 --> 02:33:19,789
the hell is that

3605
02:33:17,689 --> 02:33:22,550
and I'll just leave me alone I need to

3606
02:33:19,790 --> 02:33:25,130
work on something if you look at our

3607
02:33:22,549 --> 02:33:27,170
vaporization water tool design I used I

3608
02:33:25,129 --> 02:33:29,028
sketches not just because I like the

3609
02:33:27,170 --> 02:33:32,478
option of running ice through the whole

3610
02:33:29,029 --> 02:33:34,579
tube but you know it really reduces the

3611
02:33:32,478 --> 02:33:37,269
air volume in there so that once you're

3612
02:33:34,579 --> 02:33:40,549
pulling that vapor through there it's

3613
02:33:37,270 --> 02:33:44,569
it's really minimized any oxidation and

3614
02:33:40,549 --> 02:33:46,519
so the vapor is more it's it's it seems

3615
02:33:44,568 --> 02:33:48,590
to be more active it seems to be you

3616
02:33:46,520 --> 02:33:49,370
know a racy sativas a little more race

3617
02:33:48,590 --> 02:33:51,920
here

3618
02:33:49,370 --> 02:33:54,170
real heavy indicas a little less heavy

3619
02:33:51,920 --> 02:33:57,559
in fact if it's late at night you know

3620
02:33:54,170 --> 02:34:00,620
often intentionally mix some air with

3621
02:33:57,559 --> 02:34:02,959
the vapor I'm pulling off the off the

3622
02:34:00,620 --> 02:34:05,840
tube or even not run as much ice because

3623
02:34:02,959 --> 02:34:07,879
I want a little oxidation to create a

3624
02:34:05,840 --> 02:34:10,000
heavier effect so yeah there's

3625
02:34:07,879 --> 02:34:13,188
absolutely something to that back Gary

3626
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:15,469
okay yeah because we came to that

3627
02:34:13,189 --> 02:34:18,829
conclusion when we were designing the

3628
02:34:15,469 --> 02:34:21,619
Hercules that we made the air path so

3629
02:34:18,829 --> 02:34:23,238
tight that you had to mouth too long it

3630
02:34:21,620 --> 02:34:25,489
instead of going straight too long but

3631
02:34:23,238 --> 02:34:29,180
the vapor production that the vapor that

3632
02:34:25,488 --> 02:34:31,818
it produced compared to let's say a open

3633
02:34:29,180 --> 02:34:34,040
coil design and then depends where it

3634
02:34:31,818 --> 02:34:35,590
was totally different and about the

3635
02:34:34,040 --> 02:34:39,260
venturi effect that you're talking about

3636
02:34:35,590 --> 02:34:40,130
that does play that does have a role in

3637
02:34:39,260 --> 02:34:44,870
vapor

3638
02:34:40,129 --> 02:34:47,898
in itself it actually adds a how do I

3639
02:34:44,870 --> 02:34:50,510
put this it adds to the effect of how

3640
02:34:47,898 --> 02:34:52,989
much vapor it creates the the quality of

3641
02:34:50,510 --> 02:34:56,680
the vapor and how fast it actually

3642
02:34:52,989 --> 02:35:01,129
entered a half hour how fast it actually

3643
02:34:56,680 --> 02:35:03,110
gets into a person's lung were how do I

3644
02:35:01,129 --> 02:35:08,029
put this I'm not that I'm not the best

3645
02:35:03,110 --> 02:35:10,159
articulate person I can visualize it in

3646
02:35:08,030 --> 02:35:11,689
my brain but whatever you're doing and

3647
02:35:10,159 --> 02:35:14,989
whatever you talked about is actually

3648
02:35:11,689 --> 02:35:17,659
what needs to happen in vapor what needs

3649
02:35:14,989 --> 02:35:19,069
to happen in portable vaporizers and

3650
02:35:17,659 --> 02:35:21,799
that's the direction I think we're going

3651
02:35:19,069 --> 02:35:24,228
on right now yet it's a huge difference

3652
02:35:21,799 --> 02:35:26,500
the flow form physics makes I mean to me

3653
02:35:24,228 --> 02:35:28,398
it's still kind of dumbfounding that

3654
02:35:26,500 --> 02:35:30,920
open-source math that's been around

3655
02:35:28,398 --> 02:35:33,319
since the 17th century is largely

3656
02:35:30,920 --> 02:35:37,159
ignored in this industry or it's just

3657
02:35:33,319 --> 02:35:39,590
accidental when it factors in for me you

3658
02:35:37,159 --> 02:35:41,450
know I studied medical aromatherapy long

3659
02:35:39,590 --> 02:35:43,489
before I got into vaporizing cannabis

3660
02:35:41,450 --> 02:35:45,620
and I really felt the terpenes the

3661
02:35:43,489 --> 02:35:47,510
symphony was ultimately going to be more

3662
02:35:45,620 --> 02:35:50,600
of the magic because cannabinoids would

3663
02:35:47,510 --> 02:35:52,700
be sort of commercial commodities and

3664
02:35:50,600 --> 02:35:55,520
you can only create these sophisticated

3665
02:35:52,700 --> 02:35:57,050
terpene profiles you know by growing the

3666
02:35:55,520 --> 02:36:01,250
particular cultivar in the particular

3667
02:35:57,049 --> 02:36:02,869
appellation a particular vintage and so

3668
02:36:01,250 --> 02:36:06,049
always wanted to preserve those besides

3669
02:36:02,870 --> 02:36:09,200
just sort of being a flavor flavor snob

3670
02:36:06,049 --> 02:36:10,728
I guess by nature and so with cannabis

3671
02:36:09,200 --> 02:36:12,770
of course those terpenes go at such a

3672
02:36:10,728 --> 02:36:14,809
lower temperature than the cannabinoids

3673
02:36:12,770 --> 02:36:16,700
so if you want to have any chance at

3674
02:36:14,809 --> 02:36:19,459
getting the full spectrum vapor that

3675
02:36:16,700 --> 02:36:21,409
cannabinoids and the terpenes in the

3676
02:36:19,459 --> 02:36:23,239
same inhalations like you do off those

3677
02:36:21,409 --> 02:36:28,280
first couple poles of a properly rolled

3678
02:36:23,239 --> 02:36:30,170
cone or proper uh you know low tamp just

3679
02:36:28,280 --> 02:36:32,930
waved in the the would match across the

3680
02:36:30,170 --> 02:36:35,569
top of the V Bowl long rip you really

3681
02:36:32,930 --> 02:36:38,960
had to have a small sample size and find

3682
02:36:35,569 --> 02:36:41,539
a way to extract fast and efficiently

3683
02:36:38,959 --> 02:36:43,339
and for me it was yeah Bernoulli's

3684
02:36:41,540 --> 02:36:45,110
principle and the venturi effect which

3685
02:36:43,340 --> 02:36:48,409
as I stated earlier I was actually

3686
02:36:45,110 --> 02:36:50,659
studying for a shower aromatherapy

3687
02:36:48,409 --> 02:36:52,700
apparatus and I woke up in the middle of

3688
02:36:50,659 --> 02:36:54,140
the night and just realized ugh

3689
02:36:52,700 --> 02:36:56,061
mechanics fluid mechanics same

3690
02:36:54,140 --> 02:36:58,969
principles that's the key to getting the

3691
02:36:56,060 --> 02:37:01,520
best fate and that was where the is

3692
02:36:58,969 --> 02:37:05,539
where the design concept came for our

3693
02:37:01,521 --> 02:37:07,159
chamber bull still works even with the

3694
02:37:05,540 --> 02:37:10,010
venturi effect what we're trying to

3695
02:37:07,159 --> 02:37:12,649
achieve when we came to the conclusion

3696
02:37:10,010 --> 02:37:14,780
at the venturi effect was with its I it

3697
02:37:12,649 --> 02:37:19,640
was called cyclone tech for us when we

3698
02:37:14,780 --> 02:37:21,590
tried to do the Erb cartridge for the

3699
02:37:19,640 --> 02:37:23,299
vaporizers where we you don't have to

3700
02:37:21,590 --> 02:37:25,969
stir it anymore because at that time in

3701
02:37:23,299 --> 02:37:27,619
2012 you have to literally stir the

3702
02:37:25,969 --> 02:37:31,520
herbs inside the personal portable

3703
02:37:27,620 --> 02:37:33,021
vaporizers where we introduced what we

3704
02:37:31,521 --> 02:37:36,290
didn't introduce it we were working on

3705
02:37:33,021 --> 02:37:40,030
the cyclone tech where the air would

3706
02:37:36,290 --> 02:37:43,160
circulate around and in the herb itself

3707
02:37:40,030 --> 02:37:50,090
before being extract before the vapor

3708
02:37:43,159 --> 02:37:51,649
being extracted that makes sense for

3709
02:37:50,090 --> 02:37:53,090
some reason I can't hear anyone also

3710
02:37:51,649 --> 02:37:55,159
about that guys I was muted yeah

3711
02:37:53,090 --> 02:37:58,310
absolutely that makes perfect sense and

3712
02:37:55,159 --> 02:37:59,869
I think you know this is you know this

3713
02:37:58,310 --> 02:38:01,909
is this is where you're splitting hairs

3714
02:37:59,870 --> 02:38:03,829
but it's these these these hairs being

3715
02:38:01,909 --> 02:38:06,069
split that are the difference between a

3716
02:38:03,829 --> 02:38:08,931
good vape and an exceptional bit

3717
02:38:06,069 --> 02:38:11,840
yeah but too bad we weren't not able to

3718
02:38:08,931 --> 02:38:14,480
perfect the technology but it is

3719
02:38:11,840 --> 02:38:16,790
something that needs to be looked at

3720
02:38:14,479 --> 02:38:20,270
again because like like you said the

3721
02:38:16,790 --> 02:38:22,130
venturi effect what what actually people

3722
02:38:20,271 --> 02:38:24,050
are doing with the Karkat carb caps

3723
02:38:22,129 --> 02:38:26,229
right now is they're spinning it to

3724
02:38:24,049 --> 02:38:29,810
create the venturi effect inside the

3725
02:38:26,229 --> 02:38:30,949
quartz bowl so that that's just coming

3726
02:38:29,810 --> 02:38:33,409
to light I don't know how long that's

3727
02:38:30,950 --> 02:38:40,130
been being done but I have begun to

3728
02:38:33,409 --> 02:38:42,739
notice that where if you go back to how

3729
02:38:40,129 --> 02:38:44,299
do I put this basically what we need to

3730
02:38:42,739 --> 02:38:45,979
do in order to make the vaporizers

3731
02:38:44,299 --> 02:38:48,109
either whether it's a desktop or a

3732
02:38:45,979 --> 02:38:49,879
portable perfect we have to look at the

3733
02:38:48,110 --> 02:38:52,280
mathematics and what was discovered

3734
02:38:49,879 --> 02:38:55,069
hundreds of years ago yeah if you look

3735
02:38:52,280 --> 02:38:57,050
at that face you look at the old hookahs

3736
02:38:55,069 --> 02:38:58,760
you know as the article that we started

3737
02:38:57,049 --> 02:39:02,149
this discussion with you know sort of

3738
02:38:58,760 --> 02:39:04,790
the the first ancient vaporizer they've

3739
02:39:02,149 --> 02:39:06,681
got their charcoal holder that is larger

3740
02:39:04,790 --> 02:39:09,320
than where you actually pack your

3741
02:39:06,681 --> 02:39:12,341
your your cannabis or your tobacco or

3742
02:39:09,319 --> 02:39:16,220
your hashish or whatever matrix you're

3743
02:39:12,341 --> 02:39:18,319
vaporizing and that air that sucked past

3744
02:39:16,220 --> 02:39:20,300
that charcoal is getting heated and then

3745
02:39:18,319 --> 02:39:22,310
it's being accelerated by venturi

3746
02:39:20,300 --> 02:39:23,841
through your substrate that you're

3747
02:39:22,310 --> 02:39:25,699
actually looking to vaporizer

3748
02:39:23,841 --> 02:39:29,149
really in the case of hookahs hybrid

3749
02:39:25,700 --> 02:39:31,131
vapor smoking and yeah I mean it's it's

3750
02:39:29,149 --> 02:39:32,810
really nothing new it's the same way

3751
02:39:31,130 --> 02:39:35,449
nature works if you look at the way

3752
02:39:32,810 --> 02:39:37,790
waves are created in nature and wind

3753
02:39:35,450 --> 02:39:39,561
gets funneled through the forest it's I

3754
02:39:37,790 --> 02:39:40,939
think that's you know for me that was

3755
02:39:39,560 --> 02:39:43,940
always where the inspiration came from

3756
02:39:40,940 --> 02:39:45,950
the physics of nature but you're

3757
02:39:43,940 --> 02:39:49,310
absolutely on to it love to huddle up

3758
02:39:45,950 --> 02:39:52,490
i'm i'm fairly burst in the venturi

3759
02:39:49,310 --> 02:39:54,290
effect and Bernoulli's principle let me

3760
02:39:52,489 --> 02:39:56,239
ask a question real quick because i'm

3761
02:39:54,290 --> 02:39:57,831
trying to catch up to speed with you

3762
02:39:56,239 --> 02:39:59,931
guys i mean i'm familiar with the

3763
02:39:57,831 --> 02:40:02,271
venturi effect but I'm familiar with how

3764
02:39:59,931 --> 02:40:04,791
you're applying it in your devices are

3765
02:40:02,271 --> 02:40:07,791
you putting your material like at the

3766
02:40:04,790 --> 02:40:11,120
choke point before or after like where

3767
02:40:07,790 --> 02:40:14,960
are you putting it well in in our device

3768
02:40:11,120 --> 02:40:17,510
we have a bowl that's literally below an

3769
02:40:14,960 --> 02:40:20,120
intake that opens up wider so your your

3770
02:40:17,511 --> 02:40:23,271
your hot air that's can your convective

3771
02:40:20,120 --> 02:40:26,060
hot air source is being accelerated and

3772
02:40:23,271 --> 02:40:27,831
condensed by venturi right you think

3773
02:40:26,060 --> 02:40:30,921
it's reaching its point of maximum

3774
02:40:27,831 --> 02:40:33,470
velocity and maximum pressure right as

3775
02:40:30,921 --> 02:40:35,121
it goes through your substrate and for

3776
02:40:33,470 --> 02:40:37,069
me that was the magic especially with

3777
02:40:35,120 --> 02:40:39,199
raw herb you know you've got such a

3778
02:40:37,069 --> 02:40:41,390
broad temperature range across which the

3779
02:40:39,200 --> 02:40:43,641
terpenes and the cannabinoids release if

3780
02:40:41,390 --> 02:40:45,319
you want to be able to have terpenes and

3781
02:40:43,640 --> 02:40:48,171
cannabinoids in the same inhalation

3782
02:40:45,319 --> 02:40:50,690
which I do I prefer it that way you

3783
02:40:48,171 --> 02:40:52,521
really have to find a way to make your

3784
02:40:50,690 --> 02:40:54,261
extraction as efficient as possible and

3785
02:40:52,521 --> 02:40:55,881
that was that's what the that's what the

3786
02:40:54,261 --> 02:40:57,711
venturi effect does for you are you

3787
02:40:55,880 --> 02:41:00,439
taking advantage of the low pressure

3788
02:40:57,710 --> 02:41:02,739
that happens at that moment to draw it

3789
02:41:00,440 --> 02:41:05,569
out of the herbs more yeah we all

3790
02:41:02,739 --> 02:41:07,581
difference in pressure absolutely

3791
02:41:05,569 --> 02:41:10,399
big-time I mean the it's it's it's it's

3792
02:41:07,581 --> 02:41:13,790
the flow form and the pressure lavaca we

3793
02:41:10,399 --> 02:41:16,310
didn't take advantage of venturi on

3794
02:41:13,790 --> 02:41:18,859
purpose at least in this but we did

3795
02:41:16,310 --> 02:41:20,270
definitely this little ceramic injection

3796
02:41:18,860 --> 02:41:22,279
molded piece

3797
02:41:20,270 --> 02:41:24,738
is made a little bit asymmetrical it's

3798
02:41:22,279 --> 02:41:27,109
meant to create a spin if there wasn't a

3799
02:41:24,738 --> 02:41:30,288
spin already we found that air goes

3800
02:41:27,109 --> 02:41:31,998
every which way super fast though oh we

3801
02:41:30,289 --> 02:41:34,879
wanted to make sure that the whole bowl

3802
02:41:31,998 --> 02:41:36,619
vaporize is not just the middle but

3803
02:41:34,879 --> 02:41:40,279
that's mostly what we're going through

3804
02:41:36,619 --> 02:41:45,199
but actual a real venturi I've only seen

3805
02:41:40,279 --> 02:41:48,680
in in your vaporizer so far well there's

3806
02:41:45,199 --> 02:41:51,949
the venturi of pipes that I've seen that

3807
02:41:48,680 --> 02:41:55,248
the handheld pipes it's not a vaporizer

3808
02:41:51,949 --> 02:41:58,119
but the pipe itself creates the venturi

3809
02:41:55,248 --> 02:42:00,529
effect where it looks cool I'm not sure

3810
02:41:58,119 --> 02:42:02,299
but I haven't tried it yet but that's

3811
02:42:00,529 --> 02:42:04,699
that's another one that's out there

3812
02:42:02,299 --> 02:42:07,549
currently hey Mark let me ask you a

3813
02:42:04,699 --> 02:42:10,310
question real quick what uh you said

3814
02:42:07,549 --> 02:42:12,319
that you I believe that the vacuum comes

3815
02:42:10,309 --> 02:42:15,969
into play and I used to think the same

3816
02:42:12,318 --> 02:42:18,889
thing too so can you just elaborate on

3817
02:42:15,969 --> 02:42:20,118
yeah I mean absolutely especially to put

3818
02:42:18,889 --> 02:42:22,338
it in the terms that you're probably

3819
02:42:20,119 --> 02:42:24,470
most familiar with again as I said last

3820
02:42:22,338 --> 02:42:26,539
winter when I sort of have more down

3821
02:42:24,469 --> 02:42:28,759
time for R&amp;D and playing with things on

3822
02:42:26,539 --> 02:42:30,470
the benchtop I really said hey I'm gonna

3823
02:42:28,759 --> 02:42:32,029
I'm gonna figure out this dabbing game

3824
02:42:30,469 --> 02:42:34,038
and test you know all the different

3825
02:42:32,029 --> 02:42:35,828
state-of-the-art devices I played with a

3826
02:42:34,039 --> 02:42:38,509
number of the different american-made

3827
02:42:35,828 --> 02:42:41,538
coils I found that my preference I liked

3828
02:42:38,509 --> 02:42:43,578
just wrapping a coil around a glass or a

3829
02:42:41,539 --> 02:42:45,319
quartz banger because of the simplicity

3830
02:42:43,578 --> 02:42:46,639
but like you said there are cords there

3831
02:42:45,318 --> 02:42:48,948
for sure

3832
02:42:46,639 --> 02:42:50,868
at the end of the day the the carb cap

3833
02:42:48,949 --> 02:42:51,379
was everything it determined how low of

3834
02:42:50,869 --> 02:42:55,189
a temp

3835
02:42:51,379 --> 02:42:59,029
I could vaporize my my rosin or my Mike

3836
02:42:55,189 --> 02:43:01,100
Mike cryo ethanol ik I could go

3837
02:42:59,029 --> 02:43:03,529
literally to temperatures just above

3838
02:43:01,100 --> 02:43:06,588
what I vaporized flowers at if I have a

3839
02:43:03,529 --> 02:43:08,449
strong cyclonic vacuum and so I'm both

3840
02:43:06,588 --> 02:43:11,328
spinning the oil around in there like

3841
02:43:08,449 --> 02:43:13,279
you were touching on earlier to maximize

3842
02:43:11,328 --> 02:43:15,889
the surface area exposure to the heat

3843
02:43:13,279 --> 02:43:17,390
and I'm creating vacuum which of course

3844
02:43:15,889 --> 02:43:18,408
lowers the boiling point in the

3845
02:43:17,389 --> 02:43:21,278
temperature at which the phase

3846
02:43:18,408 --> 02:43:23,658
transition takes place right and

3847
02:43:21,279 --> 02:43:25,069
obviously you know in order to create

3848
02:43:23,658 --> 02:43:27,109
that vacuum you have to create

3849
02:43:25,068 --> 02:43:29,118
restriction so it's it's kind of like a

3850
02:43:27,109 --> 02:43:31,239
give or take you you're gonna have a

3851
02:43:29,119 --> 02:43:32,590
really dragged hit then

3852
02:43:31,239 --> 02:43:34,060
if you're getting that suction vacuum

3853
02:43:32,590 --> 02:43:37,360
that you want or you're gonna have a

3854
02:43:34,060 --> 02:43:39,459
nice you know kind of free-flowing it so

3855
02:43:37,360 --> 02:43:41,200
I guess it's just gonna it's about the

3856
02:43:39,459 --> 02:43:43,299
balance I think you know so many people

3857
02:43:41,200 --> 02:43:46,000
came from the the bond ripping of

3858
02:43:43,299 --> 02:43:47,560
flowers world where the idea was I want

3859
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:49,239
to snap it through so fast

3860
02:43:47,560 --> 02:43:51,699
I need the least amount of resistance

3861
02:43:49,239 --> 02:43:52,780
and I you know hey I get it

3862
02:43:51,700 --> 02:43:54,010
I understand that's what some people

3863
02:43:52,780 --> 02:43:56,380
prefer at the end of the day for

3864
02:43:54,010 --> 02:43:59,200
vaporizing you actually want to paste

3865
02:43:56,379 --> 02:44:01,750
draw anyway so you know if you want the

3866
02:43:59,200 --> 02:44:03,431
cleanest full of spectrum vapor you want

3867
02:44:01,750 --> 02:44:05,739
your medicine to go the farthest the

3868
02:44:03,431 --> 02:44:08,890
least amount of it being denatured and

3869
02:44:05,739 --> 02:44:11,340
and damaged in the process you know you

3870
02:44:08,890 --> 02:44:15,010
have to find ways to make lower temp

3871
02:44:11,340 --> 02:44:16,450
efficient and functional and he's not

3872
02:44:15,010 --> 02:44:19,000
losing the lower wave and there's no

3873
02:44:16,450 --> 02:44:21,159
better way than vacuum and flow form to

3874
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:23,049
add on to that I think that are also

3875
02:44:21,159 --> 02:44:26,649
regulating you know that like how I

3876
02:44:23,049 --> 02:44:28,600
spoke of volume and depth you know

3877
02:44:26,649 --> 02:44:31,000
regulating your puddle depth goes into

3878
02:44:28,601 --> 02:44:33,159
play too if someone's gonna throw a gram

3879
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:35,110
into one of my bangers it's not gonna

3880
02:44:33,159 --> 02:44:38,771
cook as efficiently if they would have

3881
02:44:35,110 --> 02:44:40,300
loaded in in ten stages of 0.1 well

3882
02:44:38,771 --> 02:44:41,891
that's that's the beautiful thing and I

3883
02:44:40,299 --> 02:44:43,359
think that's why bubble prefers doing

3884
02:44:41,890 --> 02:44:45,039
the small taste or dabs I mean

3885
02:44:43,360 --> 02:44:48,310
especially if you have access to high

3886
02:44:45,040 --> 02:44:51,010
quality materials to vaporize you don't

3887
02:44:48,310 --> 02:44:54,101
need to as they say waste it to taste it

3888
02:44:51,010 --> 02:44:55,780
I mean you know if you I've got a rosin

3889
02:44:54,101 --> 02:44:58,960
that I pressed out last year virgin

3890
02:44:55,780 --> 02:45:01,271
flour rosin was 7.75% turps I mean I've

3891
02:44:58,959 --> 02:45:03,640
seen guys with rosin as high as nine

3892
02:45:01,271 --> 02:45:06,101
percent Terps if you have if you've got

3893
02:45:03,640 --> 02:45:08,619
that kind of flavor you don't need a

3894
02:45:06,101 --> 02:45:10,840
half a gram in your bucket it makes more

3895
02:45:08,620 --> 02:45:13,329
sense to take little tasters and get

3896
02:45:10,840 --> 02:45:15,489
that full symphony effect anyway take a

3897
02:45:13,329 --> 02:45:17,829
whole bunch of them do you know how much

3898
02:45:15,489 --> 02:45:20,110
vacuum pressure has to be created to

3899
02:45:17,829 --> 02:45:22,870
lower the boiling point just a single

3900
02:45:20,110 --> 02:45:24,310
degree oh it's a good question I'm not

3901
02:45:22,870 --> 02:45:25,540
sure what that metric is but you can

3902
02:45:24,310 --> 02:45:27,190
look it up on Google there there's

3903
02:45:25,540 --> 02:45:29,891
there's there's there's curves that give

3904
02:45:27,190 --> 02:45:32,980
you an idea of where the boiling point

3905
02:45:29,890 --> 02:45:34,720
goes based upon the pressure for by the

3906
02:45:32,979 --> 02:45:37,299
way it's different with all materials

3907
02:45:34,720 --> 02:45:38,739
like with water it's gonna be different

3908
02:45:37,299 --> 02:45:40,779
than it will with oil so I was just

3909
02:45:38,739 --> 02:45:42,760
wondering if you knew by chance no and

3910
02:45:40,780 --> 02:45:44,921
then the terpene profile of course makes

3911
02:45:42,760 --> 02:45:47,489
it unique and specific to every single

3912
02:45:44,921 --> 02:45:50,261
gently you're putting in there so right

3913
02:45:47,489 --> 02:45:52,630
we tried to measure pressures in

3914
02:45:50,261 --> 02:45:55,301
different places for different reasons

3915
02:45:52,630 --> 02:45:57,850
we wanted the vaporizer to know if it

3916
02:45:55,300 --> 02:45:59,770
was being drawn from and and you know it

3917
02:45:57,851 --> 02:46:03,400
just its temperature whatever and the

3918
02:45:59,771 --> 02:46:05,791
just ordinary pressure sensors could not

3919
02:46:03,399 --> 02:46:09,399
tell that little difference at all

3920
02:46:05,790 --> 02:46:11,350
it's it's a small change the human

3921
02:46:09,399 --> 02:46:13,091
sensor reigned supreme you guys I'm

3922
02:46:11,351 --> 02:46:21,341
telling you the human sensor reigns

3923
02:46:13,091 --> 02:46:23,381
supreme yeah I agree in this particular

3924
02:46:21,341 --> 02:46:25,841
world though I've seen the same thing

3925
02:46:23,380 --> 02:46:27,069
and I don't know if it's just a paying

3926
02:46:25,841 --> 02:46:29,711
more attention or if there's something

3927
02:46:27,069 --> 02:46:31,720
to be said for the olfactory of

3928
02:46:29,710 --> 02:46:33,581
particular people who happen to be the

3929
02:46:31,720 --> 02:46:35,470
innovators in these different aspects of

3930
02:46:33,581 --> 02:46:37,810
Industry that are just almost like the

3931
02:46:35,470 --> 02:46:40,210
cannabis sommelier where they're just

3932
02:46:37,810 --> 02:46:42,040
there their nose is smelling things a

3933
02:46:40,210 --> 02:46:43,960
little bit deeper than someone who's

3934
02:46:42,040 --> 02:46:45,909
just like you know I'm often amazed when

3935
02:46:43,960 --> 02:46:48,460
someone post there but out of a bag and

3936
02:46:45,909 --> 02:46:50,921
it stinks like mold and I'm like ooh and

3937
02:46:48,460 --> 02:46:53,319
they'll be like what well you know some

3938
02:46:50,921 --> 02:46:54,909
turps that's musk I'm like no bro that's

3939
02:46:53,319 --> 02:46:57,819
like mold

3940
02:46:54,909 --> 02:46:59,860
actually it's that's not terroir I can

3941
02:46:57,819 --> 02:47:04,449
see it it's right there on the but it's

3942
02:46:59,860 --> 02:47:05,501
just like that's not so I think that

3943
02:47:04,450 --> 02:47:08,141
there's something to be said for that

3944
02:47:05,501 --> 02:47:10,149
bioassay the importance of trying

3945
02:47:08,140 --> 02:47:12,220
something for your own head and and

3946
02:47:10,149 --> 02:47:14,681
making those decisions which I'm sure

3947
02:47:12,220 --> 02:47:16,421
would be a good place to start tasks in

3948
02:47:14,681 --> 02:47:17,739
regards to trying to figure out what

3949
02:47:16,421 --> 02:47:20,671
vacuum works best

3950
02:47:17,739 --> 02:47:23,409
just through the bioassay I mean I I

3951
02:47:20,671 --> 02:47:25,720
have like one two three four five six

3952
02:47:23,409 --> 02:47:27,761
seven different carb caps here and I use

3953
02:47:25,720 --> 02:47:29,199
them all at different times it depends

3954
02:47:27,761 --> 02:47:30,729
on kind of what kind of a rip I'm

3955
02:47:29,200 --> 02:47:33,341
looking for like if I'm looking for that

3956
02:47:30,729 --> 02:47:35,290
high anxiety like sitting on the edge of

3957
02:47:33,341 --> 02:47:38,440
my chair I'm on the brink of highness

3958
02:47:35,290 --> 02:47:41,319
well I'm gonna use my really serious

3959
02:47:38,440 --> 02:47:43,909
vacuum carb cap the one that has like no

3960
02:47:41,319 --> 02:47:46,039
air flow almost at all and I'm just like

3961
02:47:43,909 --> 02:47:50,170
that seems too when I exhale a

3962
02:47:46,040 --> 02:47:58,960
heavy-duty rip of the where is my bike

3963
02:47:50,170 --> 02:48:01,460
longer flowering lean rich rosin it just

3964
02:47:58,959 --> 02:48:03,109
is quite different from if I'm looking

3965
02:48:01,459 --> 02:48:06,739
to hit something a little lighter like

3966
02:48:03,110 --> 02:48:08,090
the Juanita like mimosa very orange

3967
02:48:06,739 --> 02:48:10,280
flavor II you know kind of like a

3968
02:48:08,090 --> 02:48:11,810
dessert more than a heavy heavy rib I

3969
02:48:10,280 --> 02:48:14,300
like to hit this one because it's so

3970
02:48:11,810 --> 02:48:16,969
flavorful and I don't have to turn the

3971
02:48:14,299 --> 02:48:20,869
vacuum on full I can just hit it really

3972
02:48:16,969 --> 02:48:24,229
like boom like a big blast and that I

3973
02:48:20,870 --> 02:48:26,660
still when I smoke this hit anything

3974
02:48:24,229 --> 02:48:32,199
else on my pipe until I clean the pipe

3975
02:48:26,659 --> 02:48:34,310
because everything will taste right I

3976
02:48:32,200 --> 02:48:35,780
think it just kind of boils down to

3977
02:48:34,310 --> 02:48:38,060
personal preference with a lot of

3978
02:48:35,780 --> 02:48:39,739
people's you know is some people are

3979
02:48:38,060 --> 02:48:42,770
gonna like one thing others are gonna

3980
02:48:39,739 --> 02:48:44,899
like another I personally like I said

3981
02:48:42,771 --> 02:48:47,811
I've kind of come to the conclusion that

3982
02:48:44,899 --> 02:48:50,000
I think the vacuum is less a part of it

3983
02:48:47,810 --> 02:48:51,890
and it's more just about having fresh

3984
02:48:50,000 --> 02:48:54,500
air to mix in with the oil so that

3985
02:48:51,890 --> 02:48:58,719
there's molecules available for your oil

3986
02:48:54,500 --> 02:49:02,329
to you know interact with then and

3987
02:48:58,719 --> 02:49:04,310
keeping that puddle not too deep and I

3988
02:49:02,329 --> 02:49:07,370
think that those are the biggest things

3989
02:49:04,310 --> 02:49:09,860
for me and having a cap that creates a

3990
02:49:07,370 --> 02:49:11,391
suction I end up feeling like I'm

3991
02:49:09,860 --> 02:49:13,550
fighting the peace so my personal

3992
02:49:11,390 --> 02:49:16,119
preference is just having a cap that you

3993
02:49:13,549 --> 02:49:19,219
know has a nice flow to it but can also

3994
02:49:16,120 --> 02:49:21,771
give the oils washing around yeah I mean

3995
02:49:19,219 --> 02:49:23,449
I think a happy little ground yeah end

3996
02:49:21,771 --> 02:49:24,771
of the day it's about tuning in did not

3997
02:49:23,450 --> 02:49:27,021
just your preference but you'll figure

3998
02:49:24,771 --> 02:49:28,700
it out that each one of those caps they

3999
02:49:27,021 --> 02:49:30,470
create different vacuums and so

4000
02:49:28,700 --> 02:49:33,880
therefore you use a different different

4001
02:49:30,469 --> 02:49:33,879
temperature to get the results you want

4002
02:49:35,560 --> 02:49:40,579
absolutely I definitely like having a

4003
02:49:37,670 --> 02:49:42,319
quiver of caps we've got only she got a

4004
02:49:40,579 --> 02:49:45,680
new cap that we're gonna put out next

4005
02:49:42,319 --> 02:49:47,390
Friday to you guys by the way I wish I

4006
02:49:45,680 --> 02:49:48,950
could show it to you right now but I

4007
02:49:47,390 --> 02:49:52,279
can't little collabo with Gordo

4008
02:49:48,950 --> 02:49:54,750
scientific so score them yes stay on the

4009
02:49:52,280 --> 02:49:57,370
lookout nice

4010
02:49:54,750 --> 02:49:59,020
very cool I'm sure you guys have seen

4011
02:49:57,370 --> 02:50:02,380
the carb caps that people were actually

4012
02:49:59,020 --> 02:50:05,109
putting terpenes into that you were

4013
02:50:02,379 --> 02:50:07,658
caught yeah I'm not sure that ever took

4014
02:50:05,109 --> 02:50:09,670
off very very interesting though and

4015
02:50:07,658 --> 02:50:12,068
also the whole concept of just like

4016
02:50:09,670 --> 02:50:13,689
having cool air before you know it's

4017
02:50:12,068 --> 02:50:15,510
because it cools the air you're you're

4018
02:50:13,689 --> 02:50:18,939
cooling the air before it goes through

4019
02:50:15,510 --> 02:50:20,529
and there's also the eternal quartz guys

4020
02:50:18,939 --> 02:50:22,689
came up with what they're calling their

4021
02:50:20,529 --> 02:50:25,510
convection carb caps where they're made

4022
02:50:22,689 --> 02:50:28,329
out of quartz so you'll heat the tip of

4023
02:50:25,510 --> 02:50:30,430
the carb cap and get it nice and hot so

4024
02:50:28,329 --> 02:50:32,770
that the air that you're drawing through

4025
02:50:30,430 --> 02:50:36,189
is hot air and it you know helps

4026
02:50:32,770 --> 02:50:38,620
facilitate the vaporization process even

4027
02:50:36,189 --> 02:50:39,970
further there yeah that's what some of

4028
02:50:38,620 --> 02:50:41,890
our guys have been doing with the heat

4029
02:50:39,969 --> 02:50:44,648
one that's what really got me looking at

4030
02:50:41,889 --> 02:50:46,269
playing with the carb cap and you know

4031
02:50:44,648 --> 02:50:48,488
being able the idea of actually having

4032
02:50:46,270 --> 02:50:50,229
not just vacuum and flow form component

4033
02:50:48,488 --> 02:50:52,478
but a thermal component to the to the

4034
02:50:50,228 --> 02:50:54,818
carb cap that's right yeah

4035
02:50:52,478 --> 02:51:02,679
definitely something they're all about

4036
02:50:54,818 --> 02:51:04,719
the Trinity yes sir alright guys well

the letter W the number nine te CH calm

4117
02:54:28,370 --> 02:54:33,890
that's where you can find our vaporizers

4118
02:54:30,139 --> 02:54:37,430
that I want to point out that last week

4119
02:54:33,889 --> 02:54:39,799
I did meet up with Linus the omicron

4120
02:54:37,430 --> 02:54:42,409
that he has we had to refurbish his old

4121
02:54:39,799 --> 02:54:45,170
Omicron he had Omicron v3 we had to give

4122
02:54:42,409 --> 02:54:48,860
him the v5 he's been two generations out

4123
02:54:45,170 --> 02:54:51,829
and I am going to be receiving one of

4124
02:54:48,860 --> 02:54:53,450
the VB 2.5 to test out because like he

4125
02:54:51,829 --> 02:54:54,799
said we might bring it to market we

4126
02:54:53,450 --> 02:54:57,170
might be working together on that

4127
02:54:54,799 --> 02:55:00,289
project itself so thank you everybody

4128
02:54:57,170 --> 02:55:02,210
for coming on and thank you Marcus for

4129
02:55:00,290 --> 02:55:05,420
having son and if you have any questions

4130
02:55:02,209 --> 02:55:08,239
I'm on [ __ ] combustion too as Linus said

4131
02:55:05,420 --> 02:55:09,159
if you can make if you can pass for

4132
02:55:08,239 --> 02:55:12,260
combustion

4133
02:55:09,159 --> 02:55:16,840
questions your company is doing all

4134
02:55:12,260 --> 02:55:19,430
right you're doing okay yeah yeah and

4135
02:55:16,840 --> 02:55:21,648
yeah Garrett Gary's very precocious

4136
02:55:19,430 --> 02:55:24,280
what's the word for pearl if prolific

4137
02:55:21,648 --> 02:55:27,739
he's very prolific on it and it has

4138
02:55:24,280 --> 02:55:30,170
answered all the most tough and he has a

4139
02:55:27,739 --> 02:55:32,478
lot of heart in it and when he says

4140
02:55:30,170 --> 02:55:34,728
don't inhale off of this this that and

4141
02:55:32,478 --> 02:55:39,109
that and we don't do that by the way he

4142
02:55:34,728 --> 02:55:40,909
means it it's really reportable and I

4143
02:55:39,110 --> 02:55:44,060
think the world is really going portable

4144
02:55:40,909 --> 02:55:45,379
- maybe gary has the good chance at

4145
02:55:44,059 --> 02:55:48,529
taking a lot of what we've talked about

4146
02:55:45,379 --> 02:55:50,839
today and reproducing it in a portable

4147
02:55:48,530 --> 02:55:53,989
way because for a long time all these

4148
02:55:50,840 --> 02:55:56,898
years I Bank on plugins plug-in models

4149
02:55:53,989 --> 02:55:58,909
because I get the hit I want reproducing

4150
02:55:56,898 --> 02:56:02,329
that into a portable well oil made that

4151
02:55:58,909 --> 02:56:05,869
easy and possible but vapor someday

4152
02:56:02,329 --> 02:56:07,969
would be cool if there was a good herb

4153
02:56:05,870 --> 02:56:10,840
vaporizer that was portable maybe that's

4154
02:56:07,969 --> 02:56:13,789
subjective future future show

4155
02:56:10,840 --> 02:56:15,978
conversation absolutely well I also want

4156
02:56:13,790 --> 02:56:17,990
to thank Martin koi for coming out and

4157
02:56:15,978 --> 02:56:20,059

4158
02:56:17,989 --> 02:56:21,860
to hear from you dude and see a man even

4159
02:56:20,059 --> 02:56:24,559

4160
02:56:21,860 --> 02:56:28,010
point to bring me a lovely water which I

4161
