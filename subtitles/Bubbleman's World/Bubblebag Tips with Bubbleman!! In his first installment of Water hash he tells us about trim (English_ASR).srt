00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:06,120
hey bubble man here just wanted to do a

2
00:00:03,658 --> 00:00:09,059
new little series of Clips called water

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:12,000
hash tips with bubble man so our first

4
00:00:09,058 --> 00:00:14,039
tip is going to be today in regards to

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,539
Preparing the trim why don't we start

6
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:19,259
right at the beginning

7
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:21,059
when you've got nice trim it's a good

8
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,220
idea to go through it and make sure that

9
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:25,018
there's no types of contaminant in there

10
00:00:23,219 --> 00:00:27,598
you don't want any fan leaves in there

11
00:00:25,018 --> 00:00:30,059
or any types of stock separate your fine

12
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,340
trim and your popcorn bud out

13
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:33,960
themselves if you can do this at the

14
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,180
start while you're trimming off the

15
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,399
plant if you're using fresh material

16
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:40,200
freeze it right away if you're not using

17
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,719
fresh material no problem but make sure

18
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,940
you trim over a tight screen that will

19
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,399
help save some of the dry sifted resin

20
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:49,140
that will fall off in the due to the

21
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:49,980
brittleness of the dry nature of the

22
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,520
herb

23
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:55,859
so you can use cannabis buds you can use

24
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,840
trim you can use stock you can use all

25
00:00:55,859 --> 00:01:00,299
these different things but really make

26
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,280
sure your trim is clean have it

27
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:04,739
separated out and you'll find that the

28
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:07,079
quality of your final product will

29
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:09,659
sometimes go up uh quite a few notches

30
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:12,379
just from doing this simple tip okay

31
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:12,380
hope it helps
