1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:19,519
[Music]

2
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:25,679
how's it going guys bubble man here with

3
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:28,079
Andrew from sample automation he flew

4
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:29,278
out from uh Massachusetts New Hampshire

5
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:31,358
Massachusetts New Hampshire

6
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:33,960
Massachusetts it's New England he came

7
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:36,800
from New England get in the car get in

8
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:39,280
the car right anyway um we've been

9
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:40,679
talking uh myself and Corey his partner

10
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,960
who's responsible for a lot of the

11
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:44,719
Cannabis based information uh Andrew

12
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,239
you're more focused on the software the

13
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,879
sensors all the actual Hardware so

14
00:00:47,238 --> 00:00:51,799
Andrew's going to walk us through the

15
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:56,878
Rosen reactor today we've got uh well

16
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:58,878
we've got uh about 1,800 G of apricot

17
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:00,479
Kush rosin kind of looks like peanut

18
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:02,759
brittle right now

19
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:04,118
and we're going to get this into the

20
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:06,840
Rosen

21
00:01:04,118 --> 00:01:08,840
reactor which is right over here and I'm

22
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,799
going to have Andrew walk us through

23
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:14,118
what this is how it works break down all

24
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:16,439
the components the software the brain

25
00:01:14,118 --> 00:01:18,079
and the vessel uh and then you guys will

26
00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:20,118
have a great understanding of why it's

27
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:23,118
important to have a piece of Machinery

28
00:01:20,118 --> 00:01:26,040
like this this is so you can avoid

29
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:30,280
watching Bubbles as you decarbox and

30
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:33,000
stabilize your resin for Vapor carts so

31
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:35,359
I'll put it over to you Andrew all right

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,438
well our rosin reactor system comprises

33
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:40,599
of three main components one is a laptop

34
00:01:38,438 --> 00:01:43,078
which is going to hold your software and

35
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:45,718
our calculator you've got a control box

36
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:48,399
which can control two individual vessels

37
00:01:45,718 --> 00:01:51,879
and the third is our vessel SL manle

38
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:54,478
assembly with our manifold on top um the

39
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:57,039
way this system works it's able to track

40
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:58,959
both the Ambient Air Temperature and the

41
00:01:57,039 --> 00:02:01,399
pressure of the vessel you have the

42
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:03,158
internal product temperature as well as

43
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:05,399
you can then control the ventilation and

44
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:08,200
burping of gas as well as the inner

45
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:11,360
charge of nitrogen gas inside of it we

46
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:13,119
then fully control the mantle and we are

47
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,560
able to monitor the internal temperature

48
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,239
of the heating element to dial in an

49
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:20,680
exact temperature and track everything

50
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:23,360
both on screen as well as control all

51
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:25,840
the components of the system um inside

52
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,200
of this control box is our brain as well

53
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,120
as a temperature controller that will

54
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:31,878
communicate both the brain but also al

55
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:35,599
control the individual temperature of

56
00:02:31,878 --> 00:02:37,439
this manifold sorry mantle apologies um

57
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:40,000
we have different vessel sizes this is a

58
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:43,400
one L vessel this would be a half lit

59
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,800
vessel we have 2 L 3 l and 5 L

60
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:49,239
respectively and they all simply attach

61
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:51,239
with a 3/8 um compression fitting um and

62
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:52,959
so you've got the one vessel right now

63
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:55,120
it's plugged into over here this

64
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,640
manifold is all plugged into here and

65
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,319
then there's also another one on the

66
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:59,919
other side that you're not seeing and

67
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:02,359
that's what he was meaning in regards so

68
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:04,958
you can run two of these Systems off of

69
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:07,440
one brain the software itself will

70
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,039
actually run four brains it'll run up to

71
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:11,519
four brains so you can have up to eight

72
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:13,318
vessels all of varying sizes we just

73
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,200
simply spec it out depending on what

74
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:18,719
your process requires as a facility mhm

75
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:22,158
okay beautiful excellent so explain to

76
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:24,598
people why this is better than I mean

77
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:27,199
this is a very simple question and I I I

78
00:03:24,598 --> 00:03:29,238
know the answer myself but why are

79
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:31,399
people going to be more interested in

80
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:34,200
instead of using V ovens and watching

81
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:37,000
the bubbles uh finally stop in their

82
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:39,119
material to figure out their decarb time

83
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,039
what is this going to offer us that is

84
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,000
going to sort of take it to the next

85
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:46,120
level preserve volatile organic

86
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,719
compounds and ensure that the thca has

87
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:51,280
been converted to THC so that you don't

88
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:53,359
have uh crystallization in your carts so

89
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,640
what we found is the the usual process

90
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,720
of decar oxil obviously creates CO2

91
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:59,318
which generates a pressure from that the

92
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:00,280
typical Tech has always been to watch

93
00:03:59,318 --> 00:04:01,839
the bubble

94
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,878
and what happens when you get towards

95
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,840
the end of that process is there is a

96
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:09,679
saturation of Delta 9 and Turpin that

97
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:12,158
occurs that starts to hide any of that

98
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,840
reaction and you don't see it on screen

99
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:17,839
here but I'll briefly show you on one of

100
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:20,079
our brochur is you can see there is a

101
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:23,959
taper off to the green line of the

102
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:25,720
reaction that taper off could take two

103
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:29,120
to three times longer than what you

104
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:31,720
initially expect meaning the last 15

105
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,600
maybe 10 10% of thca that you believe is

106
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:36,039
no longer inside of that material is

107
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,919
still remaining in it and it won't show

108
00:04:36,038 --> 00:04:40,199
until 5 to 10 days later after youve

109
00:04:38,918 --> 00:04:41,839
filled all of that product into

110
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:44,360
cartridges which can occur in either

111
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:46,478
crystallization or cloudy cartridges

112
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,960
where you lose the perfect clarity that

113
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:50,680
you should have to create the most

114
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:52,399
optimal product and preserve the most

115
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,439
amount of Turin while doing so and

116
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:56,560
that's like microscopic crystallization

117
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:58,439
of thca they're not creating Giant

118
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,600
Crystals uh but they're just these

119
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:04,399
microscopic ones and they do create a

120
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:06,280
very sort of Cloudy not ideal for shelf

121
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:08,679
look

122
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:10,599
corre okay you additionally have some

123
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:13,280
more controls where everything in terms

124
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,960
of this software is all built in as one

125
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:17,758
you have a logging function that you can

126
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:20,478
start and stop you can disengage and

127
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:23,520
engage the tanks individually you can

128
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:24,800
charge them as well as discharge from

129
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:27,560
buttons on

130
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,360
screen the system is designed to work

131
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:33,160
away from a laptop where if you have a

132
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,919
TV connected you can actually pull out

133
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,080
the graphs and you can move these to

134
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:39,680
different screens if you want to you can

135
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:42,439
also if we had multiple tanks you can

136
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,280
turn this graph into a multi- graph

137
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:46,719
setup so if you had four tanks you can

138
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:49,318
show all four graphs all at once or you

139
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,199
can show all four graphs on a TV the

140
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:53,080
whole system is Network connected so you

141
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,879
don't actually need this laptop to stay

142
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:57,038
with the system you can place this

143
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:59,079
laptop wherever you'd like in a facility

144
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:00,839
simply plug it into your network connect

145
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:02,719
the soft software and everything can be

146
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:05,198
controlled and you can simply leave up

147
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,000
and display everything that is going on

148
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,120
but none of your users will have control

149
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,439
of what's going on only a specific

150
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,598
individual in your facility needs to be

151
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:15,800
able to get access to that computer the

152
00:06:13,598 --> 00:06:18,598
workaround we found is we use a program

153
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:20,598
called nides to give you remote control

154
00:06:18,598 --> 00:06:22,240
and you can simply place that on an iPad

155
00:06:20,598 --> 00:06:24,399
and walk around your facility and

156
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,598
Connect into the computer wherever it is

157
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:29,478
in your facility and remote control it

158
00:06:26,598 --> 00:06:31,680
right in front of it beautiful so the

159
00:06:29,478 --> 00:06:33,399
software itself comes as a license we

160
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,840
also have a calculator that works in

161
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:37,879
combination with this that allows you to

162
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:40,478
input the initial product amount the

163
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:42,959
volume of Your Vessel your target

164
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:44,680
temperature your target amount or

165
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:46,519
whether it's known or unknown your

166
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:48,840
amount of THC that's inside of the

167
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:51,318
material and it will help you calculate

168
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:53,719
a quantity of vet that it believes will

169
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:55,598
be the complete process you then use

170
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,759
that in combination of our venting which

171
00:06:55,598 --> 00:06:59,800
we consider consider a frequency to

172
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:02,759
create an estimated time Target that

173
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:06,840
will allow a user to be able to I guess

174
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:09,520
accomplish a full production with no

175
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:11,560
issues of Cloudy carts that you can rely

176
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:14,439
on and repeat over and over and over

177
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:16,319
again at scale and discharge the button

178
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:18,120
discharge that's for venting yeah so

179
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,160
right now we have everything set up in a

180
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,959
manual mode in automatic mode but if I

181
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:26,199
go into my controller settings and turn

182
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:29,000
it to our manual

183
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:32,120
function our discharge button will now

184
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,079
IND individually work I see and our

185
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,360
charge button will work at any period of

186
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:38,758
time but we control that this play

187
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,560
button up here this is the controls to

188
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:43,240
your temperature controller right now

189
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,038
it's only set on a single profile line

190
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,598
so you can set this into multiple

191
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:48,839
profiles if you want to this has just

192
00:07:46,598 --> 00:07:50,439
got one but you can add up to 10 they

193
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:52,119
will work their way down it and you have

194
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:54,478
days hours and minutes which they could

195
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:57,560
work through beautiful when you simply

196
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:58,918
hit play all that will happen it will

197
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,199
come up and advise you that your set

198
00:07:58,918 --> 00:08:02,318
point is that it will tell you your

199
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:03,280
heater set point and it has now changed

200
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,520
everything for the temperature

201
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:07,559
controller to start heating that mantle

202
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:09,359
exactly to the temperature you want when

203
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,839
you press stop it simply kills that

204
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,879
temperature and it will send it back

205
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:15,519
down to the value of zero heat is off

206
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:17,319
beautiful so today we're going to be

207
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:21,439
using the one lit

208
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:23,319
vessel um Cory was talking about um

209
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:25,839
leaving about a half a liter of head

210
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:28,158
space for the material so we've figured

211
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:31,839
out that'll probably be around 700 to

212
00:08:28,158 --> 00:08:34,599
750 G of rosin that's uh we have also

213
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:39,278
marked the vessel so that when it goes

214
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:41,240
into here um we'll see that the tape the

215
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:43,240
top of the tape line is right where it

216
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:45,959
goes to and so we don't want the rosin

217
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:48,360
going above this tape line that'll

218
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:50,159
ensure us that we have enough head space

219
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,360
uh with the lid of the unit plus the

220
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:53,719
little bit of extra space here uh that

221
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,919
should be about

222
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:59,440
uh that's 500 M of head space that's 1

223
00:08:56,919 --> 00:09:02,078
lit so we know no matter what as as you

224
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:05,360
go with it we spec vessels based on a

225
00:09:02,078 --> 00:09:08,039
body size and then our head always has a

226
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,720
known amount of air space for that head

227
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:11,799
space so we're always calculating the

228
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,879
fact that it doesn't the part that Cory

229
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:16,479
has found the most unique out of this is

230
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:18,919
the relative temperature change between

231
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,600
inside of this mantle and the top of

232
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:24,039
this glass vessel creates a condensation

233
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,440
of tpin and you get a reflux and you

234
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:27,719
will actually Reco because that

235
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:32,360
temperature shift is so drastic it may

236
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:36,800
be 150 to to 175° in here it is about

237
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:39,480
80° on top of that class M okay

238
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:42,958
excellent so I guess uh we can start

239
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:44,320
with throwing our rosin into the reactor

240
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:45,639
uh and then we'll see what kind of

241
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,240
program we're going to run it through

242
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:49,240
and start this uh this

243
00:09:50,078 --> 00:09:57,719
decarb all right

244
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:57,720
so put a little bit of rosin in

245
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,120
here

246
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,039
it's actually coming out a little easier

247
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:08,399
than I thought it

248
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:12,838
might um oh we're going to have to get

249
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:15,440
the vessel teared and onto the screen

250
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:16,920
onto the scale I should say I did I oh I

251
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,760
did get the weight of that on its own if

252
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:20,039
you need it you did tear it already y it

253
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:24,039
should be

254
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:24,039
1,115 85

255
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:29,639
1,16

256
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,159
1,116 M all right and go so so yeah just

257
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:34,879
a little bit of it's kind of got the

258
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:34,879
round

259
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:40,278
bottom

260
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:40,278
uh

261
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:48,440
2016 just go

262
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:51,278
o three fix that quickly

263
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:55,279
enough all right

264
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:55,278
so see if we can't get this

265
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,320
rosin into that that

266
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:08,639
vessel it's nice when you're in a cold

267
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,639
room cuz you can actually get away with

268
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:18,919
touching that's where these silly gloves

269
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:21,240
will come in handy that I'm got on the

270
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:21,240
way

271
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:27,958
here this is something else this is

272
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,958
going to be a big

273
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:30,958
challenge

274
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,320
it's like I want to grab it from the

275
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:37,039
bottom but I I can't it's going to make

276
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:39,879
it worse your hand just going to be

277
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:39,879
stuck to it oh

278
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:50,360
yeah oh there it goes that's

279
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:53,399
okay let get it figured out here this is

280
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,399
just going to be a nightmare

281
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:00,958
basically

282
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,479
okay

283
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:13,450
[Music]

284
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:21,519
that

285
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,519
okay A little bit of

286
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:28,639
product okay so 1116 to

287
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:29,399
1,400 so we got a little bit less than

288
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,320
half

289
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:34,759
on there going to take this glove off

290
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:38,879
and throw on a new

291
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:38,879
one calculator out as

292
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:47,519
well just under

293
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:47,519
300

294
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:54,679
it and we managed to get some

295
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:57,198
out that was

296
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:59,759
impressive

297
00:12:57,198 --> 00:13:02,198
yeah so work like this could be done in

298
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:02,198
the cold

299
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:24,120
room it's amazing how stuck it wants to

300
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:26,039
be before it actually releases you

301
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,759
really kind of have to cut it from the

302
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:30,759
from the

303
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:30,759
bottom

304
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:42,599
I just don't want it to be too thick cuz

305
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:45,359
I don't want it to yeah hit the sides to

306
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,360
hit the sides at

307
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,320
all if I can avoid it I

308
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:57,240
will oh this one has way less

309
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,759
material

310
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:13,799
there you

311
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:13,799
go let that fall down

312
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,759
naturally

313
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:25,239
okay,

314
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:27,560
1817 g 14 15 16 17 that's

315
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:29,360
700 say that's probably more than enough

316
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:32,078
I think so too

317
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:35,720
so tear weight gross

318
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:37,198
weight is well it's minus the 11 so it's

319
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:39,720
about 700

320
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:43,319
right yeah what was the total weight I

321
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:46,278
got calculator the gross weight is

322
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:48,560
18817 minus

323
00:14:46,278 --> 00:14:51,559
116

324
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:51,559
no

325
00:14:52,039 --> 00:15:01,759
116 701 18 177 base

326
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:04,040
42 now weight is 7:01 yep

327
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:06,199
Point did you do the oh no I didn't know

328
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:08,360
the I'll do I'll do

329
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:10,838
them

330
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:14,919
1817 go we've got our rosin we got about

331
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:18,079
700 g in here into the vessel and then

332
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:20,799
into the reactor it goes so you simply

333
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:21,958
place it in and then you've placed a a

334
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:24,479
small

335
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:27,000
little o-ring yep there's an O-ring that

336
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,920
comes with every vessel that simply gets

337
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,198
placed into the groove that's literally

338
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:32,278
listed on the head that's going to

339
00:15:30,198 --> 00:15:33,479
create your seal and your vacuum that's

340
00:15:32,278 --> 00:15:36,120
it you're going to slide your mantel

341
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:38,120
underneath we use a little stainless

342
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:40,560
tray to make sure everything nicely fits

343
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:43,240
underneath and stays balanced for us

344
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:44,919
okay that's that little guy right there

345
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,839
we have much better stands that we

346
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:49,159
provide with the product it's just it's

347
00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:51,079
the demo [ __ ] easy one yeah yeah well

348
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:52,838
we're doing line up your probe

349
00:15:51,078 --> 00:15:55,318
centrally and then you're simply going

350
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:58,000
to hold your your head and loosen your

351
00:15:55,318 --> 00:16:00,599
two clamps to allow everything to slide

352
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,600
down

353
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:07,759
okay as that slides the probe will just

354
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:11,240
press straight into the material yeah I

355
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:13,199
can see that in there too probe is in

356
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:15,879
and then all we're going to do is use

357
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:18,879
the clamp which has a freet

358
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:18,879
not

359
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:26,799
attachment it has a wing

360
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,879
clamp simply going to do just press it

361
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:34,799
in and remember these things are tight

362
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:37,120
cuz it's a seal that you're holding yeah

363
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:37,120
yeah of

364
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:42,278
course and that's that what was that

365
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:43,399
that came off there I think it was just

366
00:16:42,278 --> 00:16:45,559
probably a little piece of that little

367
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:46,919
thing there oh yeah just piece the clamp

368
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:49,479
perfect

369
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:52,278
perfect excellent that's it so then

370
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:56,839
that's now sealed in place the Rosen

371
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:58,480
reactor is almost ready to go that's it

372
00:16:56,839 --> 00:17:00,000
and then we don't have any nitrogen so

373
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,360
so we're going to just do we're going to

374
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,679
assume I did a pressure test to the

375
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,880
vessel before it came here so I know

376
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:06,918
it's going to be sealed M but

377
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:10,799
effectively we're going to make sure

378
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:12,120
we've got all of our settings correct so

379
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:14,359
you're going through the settings here

380
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:16,159
go through the settings so we're in Ros

381
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:18,759
we got a Fahrenheit temperature we're in

382
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,798
a temperature control setup our logging

383
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:22,720
file yep we want our pathway for our

384
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:25,160
folder we're going to prompt for a file

385
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:27,199
name perfect we then have our logging

386
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:29,000
time interval so this will log on a 30

387
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,600
second interval there's also on the

388
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,839
right hand side mhm for all your

389
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:35,879
settings beautiful we're then going to

390
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:39,720
go to our tank settings and

391
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:43,799
switch to go into our Auto high low

392
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:45,960
mode oh come on gloves don't like no

393
00:17:43,798 --> 00:17:49,359
they don't that's fun the

394
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:51,960
screen enable our discharge mode so

395
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:54,959
we've now lost control of our manual

396
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:57,720
discharge button y we've set our trigger

397
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:00,360
value so our high trigger value is 5 PSI

398
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:02,839
our low trigger value is one

399
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:06,240
PSI close our

400
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:07,839
screen and when we hit start it's going

401
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,240
to erase the

402
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:13,519
background we are then going to leave

403
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:15,919
this as our file name unless you want to

404
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:20,639
change it to what you had for

405
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:22,159
your to that yeah rp23 do2 and then I

406
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,640
guess we could add the D cuz when it

407
00:18:22,159 --> 00:18:26,080
comes out when it's finished it'll be

408
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:28,640
decarbox

409
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:30,158
elated we'll save that as our file name

410
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:33,240
so this is going to save and log as a

411
00:18:30,159 --> 00:18:36,000
CSV file and two things have happened

412
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:39,120
both the logging has started your graph

413
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,119
is eras to restart it started tracking

414
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:43,359
the release rate for PSI per second and

415
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:46,558
it has started the

416
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:48,719
heater so that's the release rate you've

417
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:52,038
got discharge mode you've got ambient

418
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,240
temp product temp heater set point

419
00:18:52,038 --> 00:18:56,279
heater

420
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:59,079
temp as well as pressure low pressure

421
00:18:56,279 --> 00:19:01,918
high and pressure effectively the five

422
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:04,240
on top cuz this release rate will only

423
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:06,640
exist when logging it will disappear

424
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,839
when not logging but everything from the

425
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,280
midpoint up is pressure everything from

426
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:12,158
the midpoint down is temperature

427
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:14,879
temperature and so we've got it set at

428
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:17,159
180 we're going to let it sit and let it

429
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,200
increase in temperature this is starting

430
00:19:17,159 --> 00:19:21,880
to autotune to get to the exact

431
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,679
temperature of 180° and set as a fixed

432
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:26,880
temperature mhm and we're going to

433
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:29,000
Simply sit back and wait

434
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,600
beautiful excellent

435
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,599
let's do some

436
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:46,159
waiting so I just asked Andrew uh you

437
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:47,759
know what we're actually waiting for and

438
00:19:46,159 --> 00:19:49,360
he gave a good explanation so we'll go

439
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:51,640
through that real quick so we've now

440
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:54,479
started the process we're waiting for an

441
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:57,679
initial build of temperature right now

442
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:59,759
our product temperature is only at 55°

443
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:02,000
which means we most likely aren't having

444
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:03,679
any kind of reaction take place so we

445
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,960
want to wait until our product

446
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:08,038
temperature stabilizes once that

447
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:11,159
stabilizes you will then start to

448
00:20:08,038 --> 00:20:13,319
generate a frequency of venting and that

449
00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:15,400
frequency of venting allows you to

450
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:17,439
determine a time scale if you have a

451
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:19,519
known count of total burps that you're

452
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,759
aiming for and you have a frequency of

453
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:23,960
those burps our calculator then helps

454
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:26,440
you determine an estimated time scale

455
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:28,798
for that entire process which helps for

456
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:32,038
that very last 10%

457
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:34,440
% usually pull that's the part that's

458
00:20:32,038 --> 00:20:36,599
the biggest catch cuz you've gotten 90%

459
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:38,558
of the way there and you've just hurt

460
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:39,798
yourself by pulling it early all right

461
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:41,678
so we'll wait till it gets up to

462
00:20:39,798 --> 00:20:43,639
temperature we'll wait till it starts

463
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,240
creating that pattern for us and then

464
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:47,720
what do we do at that point we're then

465
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:49,720
going to Simply use that temperature and

466
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:51,519
that ventilation frequency to determine

467
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:53,038
what works for our time scale if it's

468
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:54,400
going too long we're going to increase

469
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:56,879
that temperature which should then

470
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,960
reduce the frequency and reduce the time

471
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,600
okay the time in between therefore

472
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:04,679
you're having faster reaction and we're

473
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:06,798
going to Target the right temperature to

474
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:08,640
time process that works for both your

475
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:10,679
facility as well as for the highest

476
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,559
retention of these volatiles all right

477
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:15,000
beautiful thank you one last thing I was

478
00:21:13,558 --> 00:21:16,278
asking Andrew so what do we got to do we

479
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,640
got to sit around and we got to watch

480
00:21:16,278 --> 00:21:18,919
this thing now and wait for it to get up

481
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:21,278
to temperature he's like no man we're

482
00:21:18,919 --> 00:21:23,520
going to go to lunch because everything

483
00:21:21,278 --> 00:21:25,798
is controllable on your phone so we use

484
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:28,158
a program that every single laptop is

485
00:21:25,798 --> 00:21:30,879
provided with um it has a name and a

486
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:33,799
password to the PC and you'll be able to

487
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:38,278
see it but right now I can control

488
00:21:33,798 --> 00:21:41,158
everything that is taking place on that

489
00:21:38,278 --> 00:21:42,679
tank and computer from my phone from our

490
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:45,039
lunch so we can simply just go out to

491
00:21:42,679 --> 00:21:46,278
lunch monitor the entire process go from

492
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:47,759
there and it was why we would say to

493
00:21:46,278 --> 00:21:51,000
people if you want to connect it into a

494
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:52,679
network and have a main PC like you see

495
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,798
here but that PC is actually located in

496
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:56,960
the manager's office but then somebody

497
00:21:54,798 --> 00:21:58,440
who's that manager if they have an iPad

498
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,079
they can very easily still still be in

499
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:02,440
this room and control it they're the

500
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:03,798
only person that can control it so will

501
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:05,400
there be a subscription that you guys

502
00:22:03,798 --> 00:22:07,319
offer down the line where you kind of

503
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,798
can like help monitor for people that

504
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:10,158
don't know what they're doing maybe as

505
00:22:08,798 --> 00:22:12,319
well and you can kind of give them a

506
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,400
little bit of hand holding where you

507
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:15,319
know they're like we're do we're about

508
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:17,120
to do a batch little light comes on or

509
00:22:15,319 --> 00:22:18,960
you get an email now you guys are

510
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:20,959
monitoring for them and kind of maybe

511
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,480
doing some of the math and organizing

512
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,240
they can tell you what they want you

513
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,720
tell them how to get it that's correct

514
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,759
Corey um who's my colleague he will sit

515
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,400
down and we have a package that includes

516
00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:33,000
this he will give you I think it's about

517
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:35,519
6 hours of time remotely for dialing in

518
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,159
your process working on calculations and

519
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:39,879
determining everything you want to do

520
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:43,440
with the system so it both works as a

521
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:45,278
cons consultation Aid as well as a I

522
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,080
guess the best way explain is a specific

523
00:22:45,278 --> 00:22:49,480
model that works for your facility I

524
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:51,399
would call it white glove service thank

525
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:53,120
you for real just came in to do a quick

526
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,679
check and uh Andrew is just going to

527
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:56,798
point out a couple of safety features

528
00:22:54,679 --> 00:22:59,240
that he got put in uh based on a friend

529
00:22:56,798 --> 00:23:00,879
who worked at OSHA having a conversation

530
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:02,240
with him he just told me this so he's

531
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,520
going to be repeating it for the second

532
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,519
time but I thought it was important for

533
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:08,000
you guys as well so go ahead Andrew the

534
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:11,440
importance of so we have a glass vessel

535
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:15,960
that is pressure rated to 100 35 PSI at

536
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:19,278
100° C the man the manifolds all have a

537
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:21,000
adjustable prv which can be uh a plunger

538
00:23:19,278 --> 00:23:23,159
can be added for an emergency relief if

539
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,558
you need to we then have an analog

540
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:27,559
pressure gauge and a manual ball valve

541
00:23:25,558 --> 00:23:30,000
and they're all on it for worst case

542
00:23:27,558 --> 00:23:31,678
scenario situations where the vessel

543
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,599
needs to be relieved immediately of

544
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,120
pressure if it was ever to go over a

545
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:36,599
certain amount of pressure or if you

546
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:38,439
don't have any kind of connection to

547
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:40,399
this for any reason you still know

548
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:42,600
what's going on in this entire process

549
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,038
so you definitely in the Sops want to

550
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:46,319
always make sure that you're checking

551
00:23:44,038 --> 00:23:48,759
this making sure that it's closed cuz if

552
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:50,879
it's open I guess we're never going to

553
00:23:48,759 --> 00:23:52,720
be gaining any pressure there you go all

554
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,720
right thank you all right so one of the

555
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,880
things I wanted to cover with you Andrew

556
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,919
was you know there's a few different

557
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,080
things that can fail on the unit how

558
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:03,640
hard is it to troubleshoot if something

559
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:06,240
fails walk us through what that kind of

560
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:08,799
looks like so basic troubleshooting you

561
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,480
can use by the software where there are

562
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:12,200
two buttons onto it for discharge and

563
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,679
charge that control both of your two

564
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:16,400
solenoids for discharge and charging by

565
00:24:14,679 --> 00:24:19,240
clicking them you can simply easily

566
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:21,000
check there's an LED on top of each

567
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:22,359
solenoid that will flash we're not going

568
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,200
to do it now cuz it's currently running

569
00:24:22,359 --> 00:24:26,599
live yeah um in regards to the internals

570
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,399
you have two temperature controllers

571
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:30,759
that can easily be taken out by bolts

572
00:24:28,398 --> 00:24:33,398
and our main brain which is effectively

573
00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:35,038
an embedded PCB board and it's held on

574
00:24:33,398 --> 00:24:37,278
by four screws and you simply switch the

575
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:39,839
board out and that's the main component

576
00:24:37,278 --> 00:24:42,000
change after that that's actually it

577
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:45,240
okay so you have your two solenoids you

578
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,599
have this little plunger piece inside

579
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:48,440
that's it you can get to the inside of

580
00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:50,319
that valve if you need to by taking off

581
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,880
that nut you can get to the physical

582
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:53,678
shaft which can be unscrewed off the

583
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:55,278
valve body you can clean all the seals

584
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:56,960
you can get fully inside to it and then

585
00:24:55,278 --> 00:24:58,599
screw it all about together again

586
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,519
underneath it you have a a seven Micron

587
00:24:58,599 --> 00:25:02,480
particulate filter that once again same

588
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:04,359
thing you can easily take out the filter

589
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,120
put it into an alcohol bath clean it and

590
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:08,519
simply place it right back in

591
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:10,239
again Additionally you can always adjust

592
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:12,480
your automatic prv if you want to go

593
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:15,319
higher or lower everything is set to 35

594
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:17,798
PSI and after that everything is a basic

595
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:19,759
component switch out is the sensor for

596
00:25:17,798 --> 00:25:21,200
your temperature and your pressure is

597
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:22,720
held on by a standard compression

598
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,240
fitting as well as your temperature

599
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,880
probe is held on by standard compression

600
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,960
fitting all of your sensors and

601
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:31,278
solenoids are attached by m M12 um

602
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,360
four-way automation cables and all of

603
00:25:31,278 --> 00:25:35,919
that goes down to a single 12-way cable

604
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:37,879
going into your board so fairly easy to

605
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:39,520
troubleshoot and find a problem if you

606
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:41,320
have one correct and fixing and

607
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:44,038
replacing pieces are incredibly easy to

608
00:25:41,319 --> 00:25:46,319
do the concept is is you need 1 all key

609
00:25:44,038 --> 00:25:47,960
set to fix everything okay beautiful

610
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:50,558
thanks

611
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:53,120
man hey guys so yeah now you've seen the

612
00:25:50,558 --> 00:25:55,839
Rosen reactor in action unfortunately I

613
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:58,000
was unable to get footage I wasn't there

614
00:25:55,839 --> 00:26:01,519
for the finishing up um I I think it

615
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:05,240
took us around 14 hours per 700 g that

616
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:08,158
we ran um we did end up doing about 2700

617
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:10,359
or just over 2 and 1/2 kilos uh we got

618
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:12,720
it into carts which I can show you the

619
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:15,199
picture of the cart very nice color the

620
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:17,360
color in the labs when you're doing

621
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,200
video the rosin looked much darker than

622
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:21,278
it actually was it looked kind of like a

623
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:24,319
peanut butter but it was quite yellow

624
00:26:21,278 --> 00:26:27,319
amberh color in the uh Vape carts The

625
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:31,000
Taste was absolutely phenomenal we are

626
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:34,439
wai waiting for the final COA in regards

627
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,278
to showing that we got a tpine increase

628
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:38,558
uh Cory did hit me up the other day and

629
00:26:36,278 --> 00:26:41,440
let me know that he was getting um a

630
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:43,440
substantial increase in Tarpin uh from a

631
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,480
couple of batches that he did recently

632
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,840
in

633
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:50,240
Florida um we're quite excited with the

634
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:52,000
unit we got to admit taste Wise decarbox

635
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:55,079
Wise we had the COA come in and it was

636
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,919
like 100% decarbed to Perfection so this

637
00:26:55,079 --> 00:27:00,359
really allows you to get that 100%

638
00:26:56,919 --> 00:27:02,080
decarb and get it accurate so you're not

639
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:05,398
watching bubbles you're able to monitor

640
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:07,000
through your phone which is great and um

641
00:27:05,398 --> 00:27:08,719
yeah we're going to be using the Rosen

642
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,359
reactor here for a little bit if anyone

643
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,240
has any interest or questions about the

644
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:16,918
Rosen reactor please feel free to reach

645
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:18,720
out to me at bcbl man.com or sorry BC

646
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:20,960
bubbleman

647
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,159
icloud.com uh send me an email I can

648
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,038
send you some information I can uh hook

649
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:27,039
you guys up with the company I am going

650
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:30,158
to be uh helping them move some units

651
00:27:27,038 --> 00:27:31,919
here in Canada and hopefully in the US

652
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:34,278
all in all we're quite happy with the

653
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:36,720
white glove service um we're quite happy

654
00:27:34,278 --> 00:27:40,440
with the fact that Corey was monitoring

655
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:43,120
the decarb each and every time and uh

656
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:45,120
yeah we're just uh you know more tools

657
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:47,879
to be created for the industry that

658
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:50,239
we're in that are designed specifically

659
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:52,919
for these jobs rather than Jerry rigging

660
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:55,278
and doing things sort of half asked so

661
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:57,880
if you guys have any questions um I will

662
00:27:55,278 --> 00:27:59,839
try to do a follow-up video eventually

663
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:03,039
uh showing the final process of Us

664
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:05,519
opening the unit if you allow the unit

665
00:28:03,038 --> 00:28:07,558
to heat up the rosin can be quite

666
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:10,359
viscous and that way you can take that

667
00:28:07,558 --> 00:28:12,200
and pour it right into your filling

668
00:28:10,359 --> 00:28:14,759
machines if you're doing Vape carts or

669
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:16,759

670
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:20,398
