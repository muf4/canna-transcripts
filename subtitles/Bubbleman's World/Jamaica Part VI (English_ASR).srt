126
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:54,039
known to have healing and other

127
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:56,879
properties in fact last year the

128
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:58,919

129
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:00,000

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,440
at the University of the West Indies

132
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:08,640
which will be seeking to use indigenous

133
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:11,760
plants from which to derive substances

134
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:14,039
that are cancer fighting as well as are

135
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:17,319
able to prevent

136
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:21,078
cancers Jamaica has several types of

137
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:24,120
plants herbs and natural Waters with

138
00:09:21,078 --> 00:09:27,078
mineral reserves that are only found

139
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:30,320
here this means that there is a great

140
00:09:27,078 --> 00:09:32,439
economic potential in such an industry

141
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,959
and so we need to promote and get our

142

00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:09,719
another important step in our country's

262
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:12,360
quest to diversify our agricultural

263
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:15,639
production through the development of

264
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:18,639
high valued outputs and to tap into the

265
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:21,839
billion dooll neutraceutical industry

266
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:23,799
with a desire for personalized medicine

267
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:26,600
and the increased demand for

268
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:29,120
preventative medicine this industry

269
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:33,519
ladies and gentlemen which is expected

270
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:37,679
to reach over us 200 billion globally by

271
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:40,879
2016 presents vast opportunities for the

272
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:43,479
agricultural sector and by extension the

273
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:46,600
Jamaican

274
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:49,560
economy despite the high quality of our

275
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:52,519
spices and herbs and the scientific

276
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:55,758
expertise available in Jamaica our

277
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:59,240
exports have been relatively small in

278
00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:01,519
fact with within the hemisphere Brazil

279
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:04,000
has been one of the major providers of

280
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:07,959
raw materials for the industry which

281
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:10,318
includes oils algae and herbs given that

282
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:14,078
a variety of medicinal plants such as

283
00:16:10,318 --> 00:16:17,439
guinean weed sarasi and balmos are grown

284
00:16:14,078 --> 00:16:20,439
locally and over 50% of the

285
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:23,000
established 160 medicinal plants are

286
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:26,079
grown here in Jamaica we have the

287
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,919
potential to become a major player in

288
00:16:26,078 --> 00:16:31,559
this industry and if these plants are

289
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:33,958
properly harnessed this industry could

290
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:36,278
boost earnings and job

291
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:38,198
creation with a reduction in

292
00:16:36,278 --> 00:16:41,519
preferential markets for Jamaica's

293
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:44,120
traditional export crops such as sugar

294
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:46,839
and in light of the increasing potential

295
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:49,399
for non-traditional high value added

296
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:51,759
agricultural products the Ministry of

297
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:54,919
Agriculture and Fisheries through our

298
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:57,720
export division has embarked on a

299
00:16:54,919 --> 00:17:02,159
sustained and strategic program for the

300
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:06,000
development of FL Flor fragrances and

301
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:08,798
spices these flavors fragrances and

302
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:13,558
spices are extracted from Ginger

303
00:17:08,798 --> 00:17:16,879
turmeric pimento nutmeg and guineen weed

304
00:17:13,558 --> 00:17:19,199
among our priorities are the expansion

305
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,799
of the spice Industry Program by

306
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:24,240
increasing our production and yield and

307
00:17:21,798 --> 00:17:27,199
the introduction of new varieties and

308
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:29,558
increased exports of herbs and spices

309
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:32,840
through value chain development for

310
00:17:29,558 --> 00:17:35,440
example for powder and oils as well as

311
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:39,319
the implementation of quality assurance

312
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:42,240
programs in the spices industry to this

313
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:45,319
end we have reestablished the Jamaican

314
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:50,038
ginger as a dominant product in the

315
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:52,079
global market and over 60 spice Farms

316
00:17:50,038 --> 00:17:55,240
have been Global Gap

317
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:56,918
certified as a supplier of the raw

318
00:17:55,240 --> 00:18:00,480
materials for the neutraceutical

319
00:17:56,919 --> 00:18:02,679
industry we are aware of the potential

320
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:07,038
and benefits that this industry offers

321
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:10,000
to Jamaica's Agri bus sector in addition

322
00:18:07,038 --> 00:18:12,480
Jamaica's informal herbal industry and

323
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,720
the traditional knowledge regarding its

324
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:18,798
many healthy and Rich endemic species

325
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:22,400
are key contextual appropriateness for

326
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:24,960
the establishment of this industry so

327
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:27,280
given the growing demand for neutral

328
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:30,558
products the development of this

329
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:34,639
National neutral industry comes at a

330
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:37,038
very opportune time the fact is finding

331
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:40,280
new market niches for our crops is of

332
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:42,599
Paramount importance finding new uses

333
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:44,639
for our crops for example or Ginger

334
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:47,599
which is Renown for its potency

335
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:50,679
worldwide offers good economic and

336
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:54,240
livelihood potential for our Farmers

337
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:58,200
Jamaica is well positioned in terms of

338
00:18:54,240 --> 00:19:01,519
products space land techniques and high

339
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:04,159
quality raw materials it is for these

340
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:06,879
reasons that I welcome the introduction

341
00:19:04,159 --> 00:19:09,559
of this industry focused on

342
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:13,240
neutral many of which can be developed

343
00:19:09,558 --> 00:19:15,440
from crops that Jamaica grows naturally

344
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:19,400
the development of the nutriceutical

345
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:23,600
industry is not only relevant but timely

346
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:26,559
and important for the development of our

347
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:29,918
country the Ministry of Agriculture and

348
00:19:26,558 --> 00:19:32,839

fruit yeah the fruit it's interesting

360
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:09,919
you know the folklore in this country

361
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:12,879
about the stem of the POA plant uh if

362
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:15,440
you cut it and put for example a picture

363
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,440
in it and leave it there I gather the

364
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,038
picture

365
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:22,080

00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:49,278
industry marks an important waterers

418
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:52,200
shell in the development of Jamaica's

419
00:22:49,278 --> 00:22:55,319
science-based

420
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:57,080
Industries to be sure this effort

421
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:59,960
demonstrates the

422
00:22:57,079 --> 00:23:03,079
direction that the Country Must further

423
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:06,480
Embrace if we are to expect to move

424
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:09,000
industry up the knowledge

425
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:12,240
chain moving up the knowledge chain is

426
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:15,278
critical to developing value chains and

427
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:17,599
transforming the industrial industry

428
00:23:15,278 --> 00:23:20,558
landscape and to offer greater

429
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:23,319
opportunities for a scientific and

430
00:23:20,558 --> 00:23:24,960
Technical Workforce

431
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:29,359
entrepreneurs

432
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,360
investors and our workers

433
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:35,080
ladies and gentlemen our country has

434
00:23:32,679 --> 00:23:37,640
been blessed with the natural resources

435
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:41,639
to support the development of a

436
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:44,240
lucrative neutral

437
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:46,679
industry and indeed Jamaica has more

438
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:50,798
than half as was the point was made

439
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:55,640
earlier more than half of the 160 plants

440
00:23:50,798 --> 00:23:58,918
declared worldwide as having medicinal

441
00:23:55,640 --> 00:24:01,679
properties this natural bounty Becomes

442
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:02,799
of Greater significance as the global

443
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:06,480
market for

444
00:24:02,798 --> 00:24:07,798
neutraceuticals is projected to reach in

445
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:11,679
excess of

446
00:24:07,798 --> 00:24:15,038
270 billion US in

447
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:19,559
2016 and further to increase to over

448
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:19,558
half a trillion Us by

449
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:27,519
2018 let us therefore take for

450
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:30,119
example as an example one example the

451
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:32,440
ganja plant

452
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:35,278
the derivatives of this plant were key

453
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:39,840
to the pioneering work of respective

454
00:24:35,278 --> 00:24:42,880
doctors of respective scientists Dr West

455
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:44,359
lockart and low supported by their teams

456
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,720
in the

457
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:50,038
1970s which culminated in the

458
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:52,038
development of medicinal treatments for

459
00:24:50,038 --> 00:24:55,440
glaucoma and

460
00:24:52,038 --> 00:24:57,558
Asthma it is therefore propitious that

461
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:00,519
we seek to formalize the neutraceutical

462
00:24:57,558 --> 00:25:04,240
industry while simultaneously forging

463
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:07,879
ahead with marijuana reform

464
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:09,558
laws these reform laws will create a

465
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:13,120
framework for the development of the

466
00:25:09,558 --> 00:25:16,558
industrial hemp and medicinal marijuana

467
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:19,439
Industries indeed by creating this

468
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:22,918
framework we are also providing fertile

469
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:26,120
ground for new investment opportunities

470
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:28,360
including export

471
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:29,439
diversification so ladies and gentlemen

472
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:32,278
export

473
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:34,640
diversification will allow our country

474
00:25:32,278 --> 00:25:37,640
to make better use of open distribution

475
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:40,640
channels which is key as we look to to

476
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:43,799
enter Global Supply and value chains

477
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:47,559
within the international trading system

478
00:25:43,798 --> 00:25:50,119
indeed utilizing these channels is

479
00:25:47,558 --> 00:25:52,079
integral to the transformational effect

480
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:55,158
that the pursuit of the logistics

481
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:57,439
centered economy

482
00:25:55,159 --> 00:26:00,440
represents with the formalization of the

483
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:02,159
new sual tical industry the

484
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:04,720
opportunities to develop the industrial

485
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:06,679
hemp and medical marijuana Industries

486
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:09,399
become further

487
00:26:06,679 --> 00:26:12,320
magnified to this end the ministry of

488
00:26:09,398 --> 00:26:14,839
Industry investment and commerce has

489
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:17,480
been focused on the regulatory framework

490
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:20,439
for standards development intellectual

491
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:23,278
proper property protection investment

492
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:25,240
promotion and the involvement of our

493
00:26:23,278 --> 00:26:28,519
micro small and mediumsized

494
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:30,558
Enterprises in order to enable the

495
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:32,839
development and growth of the industrial

496
00:26:30,558 --> 00:26:36,079
hemp and medical marijuana

497
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:39,119
Industries already a cross Ministry

498
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:41,759
consultative group has been established

499
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:44,599
and draft regulations governing the

500
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:48,000
establishment of industrial hemp is at

501
00:26:44,599 --> 00:26:52,759
hand and will be subjected further to

502
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:55,200
consultation among the broad stakeholder

503
00:26:52,759 --> 00:26:57,640
groupings the matal standards

504
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:00,319
development as an integral part of a

505
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:01,840
robust quality infrastructure is of

506
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:04,240
utmost

507
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:07,439
importance this is critical to ensuring

508
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:09,839
strict adherence of products to local

509
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:12,960
and internationally accepted

510
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:15,879
standards it is my firm belief that this

511
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:18,759
is a key consideration for the Cannabis

512
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:21,159

established along with the regulations

Industries in Jamaica

517
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:33,960
indeed the Bureau of Standards is

518
00:27:31,398 --> 00:27:36,319
already undertaking work to create a

519

industries intellectual property

522
00:27:41,558 --> 00:27:46,839
protection is another key area of focus

523
00:27:44,798 --> 00:27:48,519
in facilitating the development of the

526
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:56,759
property office chipo will be key in

527
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:59,519
registering Jamaica's Geographic

528
00:27:56,759 --> 00:28:02,879
indications and even as we protect our

529
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:04,759
natural resources we must also protect

530
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:08,440
our cultural

531
00:28:04,759 --> 00:28:10,519
Legacy in this regard jao will examine

532
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:13,159
intellectual property rights of the

533
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:15,359
rasif fire and community in aspects of

534
00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:17,640
our traditional knowledge or traditional

535
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:20,398
cultural expressions as well as

536
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:22,278
Geographic indicators and all of this

537
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:25,518
with the assistance of the world

538
00:28:22,278 --> 00:28:29,038
intellectual property organization

539
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:31,558
wo jamro has been task with assessing

540
00:28:29,038 --> 00:28:32,319
investor interest in the development of

541
00:28:31,558 --> 00:28:35,839
these

542
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:38,398
industries even as we speak local and

543
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:40,398
international investors are priming

544
00:28:38,398 --> 00:28:42,798
themselves to take advantage of the

545
00:28:40,398 --> 00:28:46,439
economic opportunities that industrial

546
00:28:42,798 --> 00:28:50,278
he and medical marijuana Industries will

547
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:52,399
provide I am therefore convinced that

548
00:28:50,278 --> 00:28:55,278
although not one of the focused areas of

549
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:58,119
JF of 2015 that's the jamaic investment

550
00:28:55,278 --> 00:29:00,278
Forum we will receive expressions of

551
00:28:58,119 --> 00:29:03,000
interest at that

552
00:29:00,278 --> 00:29:05,640
event as we seek to develop these new

553
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:08,278
Industries I hope it will Empower local

554
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:11,080
businesses especially our medium small

555
00:29:08,278 --> 00:29:13,440
and micro Enterprises to realize the

556
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:14,839
tremendous potential of Jamaica's

557
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,840
natural

558
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:21,278
Bounty this is an opportunity for our

559
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:23,720
msmes to use our natural resources in

560
00:29:21,278 --> 00:29:26,640
ways that will bring us back to Our

561
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:29,519
Roots while being Innovative and

562
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:31,679
commercially viable

563
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:35,200
ladies and gentlemen brothers and

564
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:37,960
sisters it is it is within our msmes

565
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:41,200
that exist the foundations for economic

566
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:43,759
development job creation and an improved

567
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:46,840
standard of living for all

568
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:48,839
Jamaicans in this regard the role of the

569
00:29:46,839 --> 00:29:49,678
Jamaica Business Development Corporation

570
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:53,480
the

571
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:55,600
jbd becomes integral in the provision of

572
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:59,079
training and business development

573
00:29:55,599 --> 00:30:02,798
services as our msmes seek to establish

574
00:29:59,079 --> 00:30:05,798
a foothold in these formalized

575
00:30:02,798 --> 00:30:08,480
industries I firmly believe that the

576
00:30:05,798 --> 00:30:10,240
development of any new industry must be

577
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:13,360
underpinned by

578
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:15,880
research I'm therefore happy to see

579
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:18,158
Professor Erol Morrison here today an

580
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:19,360
integral part of this as director

581
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:22,440
general

582
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:25,079
of the development of these industries

583
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:27,640
will allow us to move towards a stronger

584
00:30:25,079 --> 00:30:30,079
and more prosperous Jamaica one

585
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:32,600
character cized by increased foreign

586
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:35,278
exchange earnings increased employment

587
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:38,199
opportunities ranging from agriculture

588
00:30:35,278 --> 00:30:41,398
to manufacturing and an improved social

589
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:44,319
and economic well-being of all persons

590
00:30:41,398 --> 00:30:47,000
involved it is in this spirit that I

591
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:50,398
welcome today's industrial launch and to

592
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,960

00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,519
natural

598
00:31:04,278 --> 00:31:10,480
Bounty and I think we all accept and

599
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:13,120
acknowledge that this is historic and

600
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:16,519
that we are very privileged to be a part

601
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:20,239
of it I'm inviting my young performers

602
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:24,359
to return at this time the young men of

603
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:26,278
Nomads uh if you could just get them to

604
00:31:24,359 --> 00:31:27,879
come to the stage and uh make their

605
00:31:26,278 --> 00:31:31,319
second performance for the afternoon

606
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:33,720
afternoon I greatly appreciate

607
00:31:31,319 --> 00:31:35,599
that all right and so while they make

608
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:37,600
their way to the stage then I can tell

609
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:42,240
you that if you listen to many of our

610
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:44,398
folk songs you'll hear mention made of

611
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:48,359
several of our

612
00:31:44,398 --> 00:31:50,638
plants that are so important to healing

613
00:31:48,359 --> 00:31:51,599
and that have been used by our forbears

614
00:31:50,638 --> 00:31:56,278
over

615
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:59,000
time and so all of this is intricately

616
00:31:56,278 --> 00:32:01,319
tied up with every anything else but

617
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:04,359
definitely with our culture and our

618
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:07,918
heritage and so much is recorded through

619
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:10,319
our folk music we remember the work of

620
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:15,320
people like the late Dr Olive

621
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:18,158
Len and she's left a legacy not only in

622
00:32:15,319 --> 00:32:20,879
recorded music but in books that she's

623
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:26,320

00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:21,960
instructive was in that song about the

00:49:24,798 --> 00:49:32,039
it was mid 60s but what is exciting is

00:49:28,838 --> 00:49:35,119
that there are number of young persons

849
00:49:32,039 --> 00:49:37,079

853
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:50,400
gamechanging move for us to have the

crucial to the country's progress we are

972
00:55:13,039 --> 00:55:17,960
not going to progress as a society if we

973
00:55:15,679 --> 00:55:20,519
continue to focus on being primary

974
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:22,240
producers only we are not going to get

975
00:55:20,519 --> 00:55:25,038
there unless we use science and

976
00:55:22,239 --> 00:55:27,598
technology to inculcate a national

977
00:55:25,039 --> 00:55:30,720

00:55:39,239 --> 00:55:44,679
popularization of Science and Technology

983
00:55:42,039 --> 00:55:47,039
not only in the formal sector but in the

984
00:55:44,679 --> 00:55:48,919
informal sector as well the new

985
00:55:47,039 --> 00:55:51,559
direction of the commission will reflect

986
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:54,240
a joined up government approach there

987
00:55:51,559 --> 00:55:57,079
will be greater Synergy and coordination

988
00:55:54,239 --> 00:55:59,239
and we'll see increased Focus on science

989
00:55:57,079 --> 00:56:01,440
technology and Innovation through the

990
00:55:59,239 --> 00:56:02,838
government and in the implementation of

991
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:05,480
public

992
00:56:02,838 --> 00:56:07,920
policy it is in this context that the

993
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:10,960
launch of this National neutraceutical

994
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:13,000
Industry assumes great significance

995
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:15,559
already the steering committee headed by

996
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:17,960
Professor Morrison reflects the spectrum

997
00:56:15,559 --> 00:56:21,200
of interest in both the public and the

998
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:23,280
private sectors agencies such as jamro

999
00:56:21,199 --> 00:56:27,719
the scientific research Council the

1000
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:29,319
Bureau of Standards JBC Pio J jaer as

1001
00:56:27,719 --> 00:56:32,078
well as the ministries of Health

1002
00:56:29,318 --> 00:56:35,920
agriculture stem and Industry investment

1003
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:37,880
and commerce are all included as we Mo

1004
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:40,318
as we move forward to develop this

1005
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:42,960
industry we believe that while the state

1006
00:56:40,318 --> 00:56:45,920
and government agencies have a critical

1007
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:47,798
facilitatory and Regulatory role the

1008
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:50,318
industry cannot achieve the desired

1009
00:56:47,798 --> 00:56:51,920
results without the private sector and

1010
00:56:50,318 --> 00:56:54,639
by private sector here we're not just

1011
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:57,358
talking about big businesses but big

1014
00:56:58,798 --> 00:57:03,679
entrepreneurs or scientists and

1015
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:06,559
innovators must see science technology

1016
00:57:03,679 --> 00:57:08,919
and Innovation to grow this industry to

1017
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:10,079
generate new products and to enhance

1018
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:12,519
production and

1019
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:14,640
productivity for instance agriculture

1020
00:57:12,519 --> 00:57:17,559

my firm belief in and unshakable

1090
01:01:01,159 --> 01:01:08,318
support for this industry is anchored in

1091
01:01:04,719 --> 01:01:11,519
the view that it has the potential to

transform the fortunes of our economy

Society the industry is growing rapidly

01:01:16,719 --> 01:01:23,118
globally 20 years ago the worldwide

1096
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:26,280
business in neutral was estimated to be

worth2 billion US

1098
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:34,359
it has already surpassed initial

1099
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:36,679
projections of us $200 billion by 2018

1100
01:01:34,358 --> 01:01:40,119
and is now projected to be valued at

1101
01:01:36,679 --> 01:01:42,838
$600 billion by

1102

2018 ladies and gentlemen

1103
01:01:42,838 --> 01:01:49,558
neutraceuticals are from food sources

with extra health

1105
01:01:49,559 --> 01:01:57,200
benefits they also include medicinal

plants and natural mineral water Waters

1107
01:01:57,199 --> 01:02:02,879
our mineral water in Jamaica I think

1108
01:01:59,318 --> 01:02:06,199
perhaps is the best we have several

1109
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:08,599
sources of mineral water here in

foundation of a revitalized wellness

1117
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:36,480
industry there are 160 plants known and

1118
01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:40,519
declared worldwide as having medicinal

1119
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:44,000
properties at least 86 of those plants

1120
01:02:40,519 --> 01:02:47,679
are endemic to

1121
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:50,318
Jamaica we already have a well

1122
01:02:47,679 --> 01:02:55,078
established tradition of folk

1123
01:02:50,318 --> 01:02:58,440
medicine many of us can as we recall our

1124
01:02:55,079 --> 01:03:00,480
parents and grandparents knowledge and

1125
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:02,559

1128
01:03:05,679 --> 01:03:13,239
various illnesses with great

1129
01:03:09,519 --> 01:03:16,358
success today we still enjoy a variety

1130
01:03:13,239 --> 01:03:18,919
of teas wines tonic drinks and

1131
01:03:16,358 --> 01:03:21,920
applications made from indigenous

1132
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:26,760
plants this traditional knowledge is

1133
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:29,440
embedded in a rich cultural Legacy

1134
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:32,039
this Legacy has been

1135
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:35,079
underutilized and unexploited for

1136
01:03:32,039 --> 01:03:36,119
serious economic gain for Jamaica and

1137
01:03:35,079 --> 01:03:41,240
its

1138
01:03:36,119 --> 01:03:45,400
people we are sitting on a gold m in

1139
01:03:41,239 --> 01:03:48,318
terms of the potential gains from the

1140
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:50,400
industry the possible economic benefits

1141
01:03:48,318 --> 01:03:53,400
for Jamaica are

1142
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:56,318
tremendous thousands of new jobs can be

1143
01:03:53,400 --> 01:04:00,318
created through Mass cultiv

1144
01:03:56,318 --> 01:04:04,639
and employment in labs and processing

1145
01:04:00,318 --> 01:04:08,400
plants there's a potential for increased

1146
01:04:04,639 --> 01:04:09,759
revenue from greater earning power of

1147
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:11,920
new

1148
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:15,640
workers there will be more foreign

1149
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:18,838
exchange through greater exports and the

1150
01:04:15,639 --> 01:04:22,759
development of medical

1151
01:04:18,838 --> 01:04:25,400
tourism lower cost of livestock

1152
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:28,559
production and an agricultural boost

1153
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:31,599
will result from more cost effective

livestock feed ladies and gentlemen

1155
01:04:31,599 --> 01:04:39,119
preliminary Studies have shown that

1156
01:04:34,639 --> 01:04:41,798
animals particularly poultry fed with

1157
01:04:39,119 --> 01:04:45,640
Botanicals certainly demonstrate

1158
01:04:41,798 --> 01:04:51,358
accelerated growth and better quality

1159
01:04:45,639 --> 01:04:53,199
meat I think Cuba is one country now in

1160
01:04:51,358 --> 01:04:56,719
feeding

1161
01:04:53,199 --> 01:05:00,919
animals with some of these things that

1162
01:04:56,719 --> 01:05:03,679
we're talking about and it was indicated

1163
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:04,920
that the meat is different and tastes

1164
01:05:03,679 --> 01:05:07,759
certainly

1165
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:11,278
better with the development of the

1166
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:14,839
neutral industry there will be world

1167
01:05:11,278 --> 01:05:17,960
class exposure for more Jamaican

1168
01:05:14,838 --> 01:05:19,199
scientists because we have several great

1169
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:21,720
scientists in

1170
01:05:19,199 --> 01:05:24,439
Jamaica and I'm am sure that this will

1171
01:05:21,719 --> 01:05:25,959
assist because the world will know about

1172
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:27,838
them

1173
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:28,639
there will be the development of several

1174
01:05:27,838 --> 01:05:31,960
new

1175
01:05:28,639 --> 01:05:34,159
Industries for these reasons I am

1176
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:36,400
determined that my

1177
01:05:34,159 --> 01:05:39,440
Administration will be moving in a

1178
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:43,559
serious way to develop the

1179
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:43,559
neutraceutical industry in

1180
01:05:48,798 --> 01:05:55,838
Jama this is an integral part of a

1181
01:05:53,039 --> 01:05:59,200
national strategic approach for for

1182
01:05:55,838 --> 01:06:00,440
ensuring economic growth development and

1183
01:05:59,199 --> 01:06:03,118
job

1184
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:05,679
creation we're not starting from scratch

1185
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:08,240
because some pioneering work has been

1186
01:06:05,679 --> 01:06:11,598
done in the

1187
01:06:08,239 --> 01:06:15,239
1950s Dr Johnson and St Elizabeth used

1188

01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:24,559
Canada scientific investigations in

1192
01:06:22,199 --> 01:06:28,318
Canada yielded two

1193
01:06:24,559 --> 01:06:30,798
jobs for treating certain types of blood

1194
01:06:28,318 --> 01:06:34,838
cancers by the

1195
01:06:30,798 --> 01:06:40,079
1970s Dr Manley West Albert lart and

1196
01:06:34,838 --> 01:06:43,880
Henry L were working on the ganja plant

1197
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:47,240
that yielded extracts from successfully

1198
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:51,440
treating glaucoma and

1199
01:06:47,239 --> 01:06:54,129

01:06:59,798 --> 01:07:04,000
work has continued over the years with

1203
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:08,880
important contributions from Professor

1209
01:07:20,318 --> 01:07:27,679
and formulating products like extracts

1210
01:07:23,119 --> 01:07:31,519
of lemongrass known as fever

1211

deep rural Jamaica or well aware of the

and

1218
01:07:47,079 --> 01:07:53,920
sorry Dr Henry L is now doing

groundbreaking work on ganu old man's

beard lignum vary and guineen

1221
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:01,838
weed let me tell you something I

1222
01:08:00,719 --> 01:08:05,159
personally

1223
01:08:01,838 --> 01:08:08,078
believe if there's one country in the

1224
01:08:05,159 --> 01:08:11,318
world with plants and

1225
01:08:08,079 --> 01:08:13,920
herbs with the cure for cancer it is

1226
01:08:11,318 --> 01:08:13,920
hair in

1227
01:08:17,479 --> 01:08:23,358
German there are several small

1228
01:08:20,039 --> 01:08:26,319
Enterprises around the island producing

1229
01:08:23,359 --> 01:08:27,920
neutraceutical these products are in

1230
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:31,520
need of

1231
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:34,039
standardization testing monitoring and

1232
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:36,319
quality assurance because we want to

1233
01:08:34,039 --> 01:08:39,399
ensure that the things that the people

1234
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:43,880
are taking will have no impact on their

1235
01:08:39,399 --> 01:08:46,838
level or having to impact their health

1236
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:49,199
in any negative way so we are doing the

1237
01:08:46,838 --> 01:08:53,278
testing and I think that is important

1238
01:08:49,198 --> 01:08:56,000
and I'm sure Dr Morrison and Dr Lou

1239
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:56,799
would have nothing else that than having

1240
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,319
that

1241
01:08:56,798 --> 01:09:02,198
done the national Commission on science

1242
01:08:59,319 --> 01:09:05,798
and technology is leading an effort that

1243
01:09:02,198 --> 01:09:09,079
is working on plans to regularise and

1244
01:09:05,798 --> 01:09:13,238
develop a sustainable neutral industry

1245
01:09:09,079 --> 01:09:15,960
in Jamaica perhaps maybe honorable Kenny

1246
01:09:13,238 --> 01:09:18,399
Benjamin will begin to plant up some of

1247
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:23,359
this place in terms

1248
01:09:18,399 --> 01:09:23,358
of the plants and the herbs

1249
01:09:24,979 --> 01:09:28,048
[Applause]

1250
01:09:28,399 --> 01:09:35,559
and I heard somebody mention an

1251
01:09:31,759 --> 01:09:39,279
sensia today's launch Heralds the start

1252
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:41,560
of a system to encourage regulate and

1253
01:09:39,279 --> 01:09:45,040
monitor production

1254
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:48,279
locations processes and products to

1255
01:09:45,039 --> 01:09:49,920
ensure that they meet National and

1256
01:09:48,279 --> 01:09:54,120
international

1257
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:57,359
standards going forward we must attract

1258
01:09:54,119 --> 01:10:00,800
and engage larg investors to maximize

1259
01:09:57,359 --> 01:10:03,719
the wealth potential of the industry

1260
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:07,800
just think of India what their plants

1261
01:10:03,719 --> 01:10:11,198
and herbs are doing in India and not

1262
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:14,079
only remaining in India but globally can

1263
01:10:11,198 --> 01:10:16,599
you imagine if

1264
01:10:14,079 --> 01:10:18,960
Jamaica that is one of the

1265
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:21,520
most I might get into trouble for this

1266
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:25,880
but I'm going to say it anyhow the most

1267
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:25,880
known country in our region

1268
01:10:27,270 --> 01:10:30,419
[Applause]

1269
01:10:31,079 --> 01:10:35,199
and I believe the most popular country

1270
01:10:34,158 --> 01:10:36,960
in our

1271
01:10:35,199 --> 01:10:39,920
[Applause]

1272
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:42,439
region if not through Bob

1273
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:44,960
Marley it's through you saying Bol and

1274
01:10:42,439 --> 01:10:51,119
shell and phas of

1275
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:54,800
price but our musical icons that Jamaica

1276
01:10:51,119 --> 01:10:56,599
produced oh yes I we produce some Great

1277
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:59,159
sons of and

1278
01:10:56,600 --> 01:11:01,239
daughters whether we want to talk about

1279
01:10:59,158 --> 01:11:02,639
those that the university produce like a

1280
01:11:01,238 --> 01:11:05,959
Rex

1281
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:08,480
nettleford and others we are a great

1282
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:10,640
country and a great people and that's

1283
01:11:08,479 --> 01:11:14,879
why I keep on begging Jamaicans to

1284
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:14,880
behave in keeping with the

1285
01:11:16,158 --> 01:11:20,799
greatness of our

1286
01:11:18,399 --> 01:11:23,639
ancestors and the number of great

1287
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:25,570
Jamaicans that Jamaica produced both

1288
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:29,969
male and female

1289
01:11:25,569 --> 01:11:29,969
[Music]

1290
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:35,239
several companies are already expressing

1291
01:11:33,279 --> 01:11:37,039
interest in large scale production and

1292
01:11:35,238 --> 01:11:39,039
Comm um

Jamaica's abundant medicinal plants I

1295
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:49,760

believes in the neutral industry he is

1304
01:12:13,479 --> 01:12:20,279
pushing ahead with it you go to his

1305

again in your life after it is better

1324
01:13:16,039 --> 01:13:20,880
when it is said by our doctors in

1325
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:23,158
Jamaica that if you hurt your ankle

1326
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:27,840
every now and then you feel

1327

[Applause]

1331
01:13:39,719 --> 01:13:46,319
run we have to include all

1332
01:13:43,439 --> 01:13:49,879
stakeholders already a memorandum is to

1333
01:13:46,319 --> 01:13:53,679
be signed with the Jamaica 4 movement to

1334
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:56,840
engage the country's youth some

1335
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:59,199
8,500 Young people in 4 clubs across the

1336
01:13:56,840 --> 01:14:02,960
country will benefit from the

1337
01:13:59,198 --> 01:14:06,158
opportunities along the value

1338
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:09,399
chain the part the

1339
01:14:06,158 --> 01:14:11,920
partnership in its initial stages will

1340
01:14:09,399 --> 01:14:14,599
focus on the

1341
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:17,359
establishment of green houses and

1342
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:20,360
Gardens and strengthening forage

1343
01:14:17,359 --> 01:14:20,359
programs within

1344
01:14:23,158 --> 01:14:28,519
some I am advised

1345
01:14:26,158 --> 01:14:30,879
that at least two companies have

1346
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:33,360
expressed an interest in

1347
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:35,440
establishing tissue culture farms in

1348
01:14:33,359 --> 01:14:37,559
Jamaica to enhance the

1349
01:14:35,439 --> 01:14:40,719
multiplication of

1350
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:44,039
Botanicals these tissue culture Farms

1351
01:14:40,719 --> 01:14:46,158
will create hundreds of jobs for new

1352
01:14:44,039 --> 01:14:49,119
college graduates and high school

1353
01:14:46,158 --> 01:14:50,879
graduates with Science

1354
01:14:49,119 --> 01:14:53,519
Background not

1355
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:56,199
only can the gradates be gainfully

1356
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:59,760
employed but these these Farms provide

1357
01:14:56,198 --> 01:15:04,039
the opportunity for the new workers to

1358
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:08,880
apply Theory to practice therefore

1359
01:15:04,039 --> 01:15:11,760
setting the stage for further

1360
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:16,279
Innovations all government agenes must

1361
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:19,039
be made more focused on assisting small

1362
01:15:16,279 --> 01:15:21,279
and large neutraceutical business

1363
01:15:19,039 --> 01:15:23,359
businesses and I want them to know and

1364
01:15:21,279 --> 01:15:26,920
I'm going to ensure because the cabinet

1365
01:15:23,359 --> 01:15:30,559
is already aware of my interest in this

1366
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:35,600
area and in in this industry and I will

1367
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:37,280
be one of the persons helping Dr low to

1368
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:42,320
spread the good

1369
01:15:37,279 --> 01:15:42,319
news for the neutraceutical

1370
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:47,158
industries these agencies include

1371
01:15:45,399 --> 01:15:49,119
especially the scientific research

1372
01:15:47,158 --> 01:15:50,479
Council government chemist the

1373
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:52,238
intellectual property office The

1374
01:15:50,479 --> 01:15:56,279
Business Development Corporation and the

Bureau of standard and jam proof

01:15:56,279 --> 01:16:02,800
Minister the join up government

1377
01:15:59,439 --> 01:16:05,479
approach is needed for this exciting

1378
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:07,639
industry to move forward and I do not

1379
01:16:05,479 --> 01:16:10,479
believe everybody every agency of

1380
01:16:07,639 --> 01:16:12,840
government going on on their own and

1381
01:16:10,479 --> 01:16:16,519
doing what they feel to do I think this

1382
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:20,279
thing this one this important

1383
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:25,240
industry must be done with a United

1384
01:16:20,279 --> 01:16:29,158
effort by way of joined up government

1385
01:16:25,239 --> 01:16:32,559
[Applause]

1386
01:16:29,158 --> 01:16:36,039
we must examine existing institutions

1387
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:39,239
that reposition them to be responsive to

1388
01:16:36,039 --> 01:16:43,119
the needs of this nontraditional

1389
01:16:39,238 --> 01:16:47,279
industry this industry I believe is also

1390
01:16:43,119 --> 01:16:50,279
ideal for the kind of private public

1391
01:16:47,279 --> 01:16:53,719
partnership that has worked well in

1392
01:16:50,279 --> 01:16:56,119
other areas and so we want to ensure we

1393
01:16:53,719 --> 01:16:59,079
form a partnership with with the private

1394
01:16:56,119 --> 01:17:04,399
sector we already have Dr

01:17:14,399 --> 01:17:21,359
is based on scientific research to drive
