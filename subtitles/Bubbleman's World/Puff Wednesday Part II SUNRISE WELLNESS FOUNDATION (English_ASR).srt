00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:19,539
[Music]

2
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:26,678
hey guys welcome back to Bubble man's

3
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:28,358
world we never went anywhere it's still

4
00:00:26,678 --> 00:00:30,038
puff Wednesday Johnny and I felt

5
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:32,880
terrible about the last one it just

6
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:34,920
wasn't enough you know what this is

7
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,520
awesome so now we're downtown in

8
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,120
Vancouver we wanted to get something to

9
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,079
squish we were both running low on

10
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:42,119
nuggets I squished all the bud Darren

11
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,600
gave me the other day into a beautiful

12
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:47,078
pad uh uh blob of of rosin this is

13
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,558
important but now we're down at the

14
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:53,120
Sunrise uh uh uh Wellness Foundation

15
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:55,519
here with uh Max and Dong we've got the

16
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:58,959
development application on the wall here

17
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:01,879
that shows that they're looking to uh

18
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,118
change of use from retail store to

19
00:01:01,878 --> 00:01:05,679
medical marijuana related use so this is

20
00:01:04,118 --> 00:01:06,799
one of the things our city of Vancouver

21
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,840
is doing they're trying to give these

22
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:12,000
licenses out for people to be able to do

23
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:13,840
business in this industry I think it's

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
fantastic what's happening so pretty

25
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,040
cool they they actually have about six

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,280
license in Vancouver now that have been

27
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:24,079
approved right and and what we're having

28
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:26,439
is legal weed let's go buy some not

29
00:01:24,078 --> 00:01:28,000
really in a sense it's not a federal law

30
00:01:26,438 --> 00:01:30,239
it doesn't really make it legal in a

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,239
sense but it makes it so the city isn't

32
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:34,399
going to come down and and send the

33
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:36,118
police now the federal government still

34
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:37,719
considers this completely illegal and

35
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:39,719
they could potentially send the federal

36
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:41,200
police but at this point in time it

37
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:43,599
hasn't happened and we're pretty stoked

38
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,240
with this step as it is why don't we

39
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:46,959
head in and check out what they've got

40
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:48,399

41
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:51,839
tell you one of the things about this

42
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:54,640
place is the quality is on point I I

43
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,399
think I think in Vancouver this is going

44
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,640
to be that that place that has the

45
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,478
quality that we look for yeah 100% let's

46
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,640

00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:54,758
beautiful little bud structure little

116
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:56,799
nlets um the third from the ogk labs

117
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:59,280
which are grown by Sunrise Gardens is

118
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,720
the o9 cookies squared and so that's

119
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:06,079
basically on cookies back crossed into

120
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:08,720

feno selection on this one uh and we

127
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:26,439
think it's definitely a winner got a few

128
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,400
more rounds to go to perfect it but so

129
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:31,240
far the response has been pretty great

130
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:34,519
um looks beautiful I wanted to show you

131
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:37,439
just a few buds here let me just grab my

132
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:40,279
gloves before I touch these excellent

133
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:40,279
this is the o9

134
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:46,479
cookies how does it smell does it smell

135
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:49,318
loud

136
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:51,599
no that's loud it's got some loudness to

137
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:54,919
it it had a scream down

138
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,919
it looks

139
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,960
beautiful oh

140
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,280
yeah o well I'm definitely going to have

141
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:05,519
to take

142
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:08,198
um take some of that the9 is nice it's

143
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:10,439
got a real nice uh thin waxy cuticle on

144
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:12,038
it too so I think it would be it' make a

145
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:13,279
really nice hash string I'm sure it

146
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,560
would sift well but I'm sure if you're

147
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:17,318
just squishing it for rosin you're going

148
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,720
to be quite happy with that one

149
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:20,479
especially the Teflon as well if you're

150
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,960
looking for turps if you're looking for

151
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:25,079
something really heavy though I'd

152
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:28,120
probably recommend the glue cookies just

153
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:30,478
cuz it's got that yield it's got that

154
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:32,918
flavor Gilla is common down in the

155
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:35,439
States but it's something kind of new up

156
00:06:32,918 --> 00:06:36,918
here in Canada M you know everyone up

157
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:38,959
here wants to go for the glues the

158
00:06:36,918 --> 00:06:40,120
cookies and everything while I hear from

159
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:42,120
all the Americans they always looking at

160
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:45,560
pink kushes which is a very common

161
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:48,038
strain to us right yeah exactly so so

162
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:51,199
this is the gorilla that's the

163
00:06:48,038 --> 00:06:54,159
cookies this one's the

164
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:57,360
cooks this so let me a little bit closer

165
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,360
I think

166
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:16,680
right my the

167
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:17,638
cooks this one's the gorilla Cooks uh

168
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,519
the one you had before that was the

169
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:22,800
gorilla Cooks that's the 09 oh this is

170
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:24,519
the 09 yeah that's the tough one all

171
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,160
right

172
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:28,959
beautiful so just by looking at the

173
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:32,120
first three I'm going to see the tlon

174
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:33,519
Cherry High cross it's a definite winner

175
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,560
if you're looking for chps as well as

176
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:36,758
yield um I only pressed it on a hard

177
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:39,478
press which doesn't have the same

178
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:41,560
pressure as a sasquat unfortunately and

179
00:07:39,478 --> 00:07:43,439
we were still getting you know 15% and

180
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,800
that was you know just with with a lot

181
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:46,519
getting stuck in our bags cuz it just

182
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,918
doesn't have the same pressure that I

183
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:50,918
didn't use any bags yesterday when I

184
00:07:48,918 --> 00:07:53,519
pressed that seven G out I just made it

185
00:07:50,918 --> 00:07:55,799
like long like a hot dog and just went

186
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:57,079
smash sometimes that's the best right

187
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,000
another technique that I've heard people

188
00:07:57,079 --> 00:08:00,318
do is squishing it with a bag and then

189
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,879
collecting it and then putting it in a

190
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,840
bag so they can squish at a lower

191
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:06,199
temperature once they do

192
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:10,679
so all

193
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:13,240
right okay so I'm going with tlon so far

194
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:15,280
turn anything with that cherry pie in it

195
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,560
right i' say I'd say the best two for

196
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:19,158
you guys to squish would be the gorilla

197
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,000
cooks and the Teflon I've already kiss

198
00:08:19,158 --> 00:08:22,918
well all righty then I'll take a quarter

199
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,120
of each sounds good let's get those

200
00:08:22,918 --> 00:08:27,079
going for you guys good on you Johnny Be

201
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:30,199
I don't eveny I can't believe I I don't

202
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:32,559
even buy it's puff Wednesday and that's

203
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:34,918
what makes it so just so awesome and you

204
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:37,278
know what I mean I be locking on the gr

205
00:08:34,918 --> 00:08:39,679
this year and and I don't have the

206
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:43,240
quality that I us to this is getting

207
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:44,399
close might even be right on par well we

208
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,039
try and definitely always raise the

209
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,240
standards we're all about quality we

210
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:50,240
don't want to compromise at any any

211
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,879
level of you know our products even our

212
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,560
$5 grams like this Tex to time War Burns

213
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:58,159
clean tastes good it's got turps It's a

214
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:59,958
greenhouse strein but you know you don't

215
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:01,360
have to worry about spending $5 a gram

216
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:05,000
on a on a stream here that's going to

217
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:07,399
get you sick ta time war is also known

218
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,320
for me is also a haly common exactly cuz

219
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:13,559
it when you grow it indoors it tends to

220
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:16,800
change into that doesn't it

221
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:18,359
yeah very lovely defitely some Superior

222
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:19,799
strange you guys got going on here so

223
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,320
you said a quarter of each but I'm just

224
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:22,679
going to split the two quarters between

225
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,240
these three because I think all three of

226
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:26,078
these are going to be really nice

227
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,320
squishers all very different in flavor

228
00:09:26,078 --> 00:09:30,199
as well cuz you'll have the te up you

229
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,360
hear that he just UPS he's like I think

230
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,720
you need all three still getting the

231
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,000
same am same amount I'm just going to

232
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,879
split between these three cuz I don't

233
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
want you to miss out on the 09 cookies I

234
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:39,879
think that's pretty awesome John's like

235
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:44,519
give me a quarter of each pretty

236
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:48,759
much split it up you're awesome

237
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:50,440
John ah yes the bet that that stock

238
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:52,278
could be a little bit you know over look

239
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:55,160
at that they even take the stock out for

240
00:09:52,278 --> 00:09:57,000
me want to give you too much stick here

241
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:59,838
I'm just squishing it it's one of the

242
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
best nugs for squishing

243
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,480
squishy

244
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,679
nugs oh John you'll you'll roll some

245
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:08,839
joints I pretty much like you know what

246
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:13,519
a nice little I I roll it into a nice

247
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:16,320
little log I I probably smoke a joint uh

248
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,839
but for me it's a Bly extractions and

249
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,000
that's what really helps for me and what

250
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:21,959
I really enjoy so it's like kind of like

251
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,519
smoking one of these uh big joints you

252
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:25,039
got to smoke that joint for like 20

253
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,519
minutes before you feel anything where

254
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:28,199
you do one little dab and you do one

255
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:30,519
little dab it's like woohoo this rocking

256
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,800
the blue Rivers yes we do we got quite a

257
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:33,959
selection of

258
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:38,319
it River

259
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:39,479
Tes Swiss Swiss tsunami Cavell s Diesel

260
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,600
black lime

261
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:44,120
Reserve well I get people asking me all

262
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,278
the time where to get tpin in the city

263
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:48,959
and I tell them this is pretty much the

264
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:50,439
one shop that I I have sold tpin to if

265
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:51,799
you don't want to wait for the shipping

266
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,800
come into the sunrise you can pick them

267
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:56,559
up the same day yeah exactly love the

268
00:10:53,799 --> 00:11:00,319
packaging too yeah so these are all uh

269
00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:02,278
BPA free craft paper um recycled craft

270
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:05,399
paper so you know they're pretty smelly

271
00:11:02,278 --> 00:11:07,200
proof what of our

272
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:09,919
signatures it's actually pretty similar

273
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,399
to packaging actually smelly proof I see

274
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:13,519
you got meder sitting over there too

275
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:14,480
with your logo on it fantastic meders

276
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,159
which is awesome which are great for

277
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,278
people who've got sore sore wrist

278
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:19,958
because it's much easier to hold on to

279
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:22,879
than one of those small little Grinders

280
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:24,599
mhm I like that Blue River meds you got

281
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:26,600
everything unfor you have some hash

282
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,839
bubble hash right behind you well we've

283
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:31,159
got a few different ones in here Rock

284
00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:33,360
cream we had some nice rosins in there

285
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:35,000
from concentrated x uh some strawberry

286
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,879
banana flour rosin but that flew off the

287
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,480
shelf within the first day of getting it

288
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:41,919
oh yeah still have some of his dry sift

289
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:44,120
rosin um we've got some nice uh Heavenly

290
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:46,439
days live resins there if you're into

291
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,278
all of those types of extractions but we

292
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,279
covering all the gamuts yeah we try to

293
00:11:48,278 --> 00:11:51,480
cover everything that's a good thing

294
00:11:50,278 --> 00:11:54,278
that's what we like to hear we like to

295
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:56,920
see access cannabis is a quiver there's

296
00:11:54,278 --> 00:11:59,399
no reason to put only one shot in your

297
00:11:56,919 --> 00:12:00,479
quiver when you can fill that quiver

298
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:03,120
right

299
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:06,000
up with all the cultivars and all the

300
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,000
extractions

301
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:13,838
and I'm pretty excited right now well

302
00:12:12,278 --> 00:12:16,639
it's nice to be able to come to a shop

303
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:19,399
that actually has some dank nug you do

304
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:22,480
take um take credit cards right we take

305
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:23,600
debit we can't take credit yet but we're

306
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,240
we're trying to stay ahead of the curve

307
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,759
of just the deit machine here well

308
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,399
pretty much you know what the the whole

309
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:30,198
thing is is is being able to take

310
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,320
cannabis and level where I can be able

311
00:12:30,198 --> 00:12:34,719
to start purchasing it on that scale I

312
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,560
think with the application being on the

313
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,560
wall and how the thing is here happening

314
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:40,439
in Vancouver I'm really looking forward

315
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:43,319
to being able to able to come into these

316
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:46,040
establishments Pur purchase legally

317
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:48,079
wreck and medical and be able to use

318
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:49,360
whatever it takes means and it'd be a

319
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:50,958
wonder if we could actually get our

320
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,320
insurance to cover it for us too and I

321
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:55,039
think we're slowly slowly that's the

322
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:57,320
next level right there yeah if they

323
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:59,399
start ensuring our cannabis you know um

324
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:01,120
um we're laughing

325
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:02,600
we're laughing if that happens that's

326
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,799
that's super amazing especially for

327
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,199
medical patients you know like if

328
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:07,278
they're going to introduce a

329
00:13:05,198 --> 00:13:09,519
recreational we can't forget and leave

330
00:13:07,278 --> 00:13:11,879
the medical patients on Dust for sure

331
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,720
not well it comes down to access and it

332
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:15,159
comes down to patients rights and a lot

333
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:17,120
of people have their prescriptions paid

334
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:18,679
for they don't have to purchase their

335
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,399
their pharmaceutical drugs for their

336
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:22,198
conditions and someone like myself and a

337
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,799
lot of others use canvas for their

338
00:13:22,198 --> 00:13:26,519
conditions so why do we have to purchase

339
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:29,198
our medication when it's needed every

340
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:31,399
day to for General wellbeing for for for

341
00:13:29,198 --> 00:13:34,278
homeostasis what I say so I feel better

342
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:37,879
every day I

343
00:13:34,278 --> 00:13:37,879
use a lovely

344
00:13:38,278 --> 00:13:42,198
plants this guy's got it down he even

345
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:45,159
knows to color he's like that's the one

346
00:13:42,198 --> 00:13:45,159
no no that doesn't

347
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:57,078
workon definitely got a very nice cakey

348
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:59,479
nose to it you know I I really really

349
00:13:57,078 --> 00:14:01,039
I'm a coniss of kushes I think that's

350
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:03,680
why I

351
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:05,559
mean I don't I don't I don't have this

352
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:08,120
in in my garden I don't I don't have

353
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:09,958
these flavors available to me right now

354
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,799
I'm sure I'll be able to access them

355
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:14,679
sooner than later well actually I am

356
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:16,879
accessing them right now here that's the

357
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:18,599
best part and I didn't spend 3 months

358
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:21,120
growing and caring it and I know the

359
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:23,159
quality is definitely exactly what I

360
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,039
would actually be accustomed to and

361
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:25,439
we're excited to have them on our

362
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:27,399
shelves cuz it's been a project that

363
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,839
we've been working on for better part of

364
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:30,958
a year now well I know the Str because

365
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:33,199
these are some of the strains that I

366
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:35,198
have popped at the beginning of the year

367
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:36,879
which was the what you guys are call the

368
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:39,399
te on the Cherry Pie CR of the on9

369
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:41,559
cookies was a strain that I I started

370
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:43,159
working with and um due to the fact that

371
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:44,599
I went for some surgeries and stuff like

372
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:46,719
that I had to kind of wait a little bit

373
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:49,320
so being able to try it right now when I

374
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:53,240
was getting ready to grow it is just for

375
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:54,600
me it's fantastic mhm yeah there's only

376
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,000
a couple of people like you know maybe

377
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,240
less than five people that are growing

378
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,639
these strains so it's nice to see to see

379
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,879
the differences mean like the few

380
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:02,600
Growers that have them because they're

381
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:04,159
all doing slightly different methods

382
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:07,199
these ones are done aeroponically and

383
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:08,559
under gavitas whereas uh I know you know

384
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:10,000
another mutual friend of ours has them

385
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:12,439
in a small little tent and he creates

386
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,078
some very very high quality fully

387
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:17,480
organic and just like gorgeous looking

388
00:15:15,078 --> 00:15:18,719
almost like diamonds on the bud yeah you

389
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:20,600
definitely see the difference when using

390
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,000
Organics compared to when you're doing

391
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,320
like like you say a current culture

392
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,078
system or a water system or using

393
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,240
synthetics um but with any kind of

394
00:15:27,078 --> 00:15:29,679
proper flesh any knows what they're

395
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:33,950
doing it's really that hard to figure

396
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:35,359
out so so I split it up like that that's

397
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:38,879
[Music]

398
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:41,800

399
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:43,360

408

419
00:16:27,318 --> 00:16:31,559
it it's been a while since I was able to
