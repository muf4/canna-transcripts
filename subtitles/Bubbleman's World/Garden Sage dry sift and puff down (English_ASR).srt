44
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:09,200
that have never hit the denail and just

45
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:11,318
kind of letting people wow I have never

46
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:15,280

47
00:02:11,318 --> 00:02:17,839
nice it's always on that was amazing

48
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,560
stream so yeah Dave Dave was saying that

49
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,159
he he didn't he didn't really understand

50
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,920
what I was when I put this in his hand

51
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:26,878
he was kind of like cuz I just showed

52
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:29,079
him the bubble it's bone dry powder so

53
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:30,759
it's not it doesn't look like this

54
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,560
doesn't look like that so he was just

55
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:35,280
mentioning that so now I'm going to take

56
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,280
a dab on that

57
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,680
note the garden sage has asked this

58
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,560
bubble here

59
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,719
just became that gooey little disc that

60
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:08,719
you had that was actually stuck on this

61
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:08,719
lid so we're going to take a little

62
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,360
piece like maybe that

63
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:18,680
much and just with our

64
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:21,480
fingers we're going to turn that into

65
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,480
what we just

66
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:28,680
had just the body heat alone yeah I'm

67
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:31,279
giving it pretty good pressure

68
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:33,319
too

69
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:37,120

70
00:03:33,318 --> 00:03:39,679

it is this is truly it that's it that's

74
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:48,759
why I laugh at this whole Health Canada

75
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,200
thing when they're like no you can't

76

have derivatives it's like listen then

77
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:55,919
don't call it derivatives figure it out

78
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:57,438
just figure out that this is marijuana

79
00:03:55,919 --> 00:04:00,839
if that's what you want to call it cuz

80
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:03,400
that's what the medicine is Purity

81
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:05,400
Purity right there yeah I like to call

82
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:09,799

98
00:04:39,038 --> 00:04:43,918

00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:46,359
shown care throughout the entire process

100
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:48,159

stop me

117
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:42,879
nice

118
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,478
oh a there we go all right so what the

119
00:05:47,478 --> 00:05:52,360
garden sage is doing here is he is

120
00:05:49,478 --> 00:05:55,639
looking at three grades of dry sift um

121
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:57,319
the first screen which was this stuff

122
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:59,960
what it looked like the one he's looking

123
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:01,800
at right now which was uh oh no s story

124
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:04,839
um this red one on the far left was the

125
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:08,560
one I cleaned from this one and then

126
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:11,119
this one I cleaned from this one so this

127
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:14,918
was eventually in here both of these

128
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:18,240
were in here I took first this out and

129
00:06:14,918 --> 00:06:19,719
then out of this I took this and you can

130
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,199
see the difference uh with the

131
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:23,199
microscope can't you

132
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:27,239
absolutely it's amazing difference a

133
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,400
little

134
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,400
off there you go

135
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,960
so what would you say is the difference

136
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,800
in the for contamination levels of this

137
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:40,279
first one although when you first looked

138
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,919
at it you did think it looked beautiful

139
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:44,000
didn't you cuz it's glandular and in a

140
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:46,079
sense it is beautiful there's still

141
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,560
heads that are smaller than 70 Micron so

142
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:52,359
we've got 69 down to 25 micron in there

143
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,399
but now that I look at it there's a lot

144
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:56,800
of the stock because you've looked at

145
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:58,318
the good one now if I only ever showed

146
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,160
you this one you could leave here

147
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,560
thinking this guy just showed me the

148
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:06,240
most beautiful amazing thing yeah and

149
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,560
it's it's neat that way so yeah a little

150
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,400
little dry SI and I think we're going to

151
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:14,918
try and put some actually if you want to

152
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:16,318
maybe scoop a little onto this onto you

153
00:07:14,918 --> 00:07:19,560
want to push some one with your the

154
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:21,800
other one there sure yeah we'll just get

155
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,800
you a

156
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:27,240
little there we

157
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:31,318
go pass this over your way

158
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:38,038
all right let's see

159
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:40,160
okay here try to put your hat on

160
00:07:38,038 --> 00:07:41,878
backwards so it doesn't steal the light

161
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:45,879
off the

162
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:45,879
screen let's see what we get

163
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,400
here oh it doesn't want to

164
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:58,318
drop would have been nice to watch it

165
00:07:55,038 --> 00:08:01,318
bubble in mouth but it denied

166
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,319
us

167
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:17,240
