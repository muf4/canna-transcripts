no I didn't even flinch

136
00:13:44,139 --> 00:13:48,309
because I don't know why it was a solid

137
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:50,650
it was the right sound that was the

138
00:13:48,309 --> 00:13:52,989
right sound but it didn't have that's up

139
00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:54,370
the sound of our energy is released in a

140
00:13:52,990 --> 00:14:02,379
place that's not supposed to be released

141
00:13:54,370 --> 00:14:05,289
and I which is more of a tank we've also

142
00:14:02,379 --> 00:14:06,490
have the experience that sound we have

143
00:14:05,289 --> 00:14:07,870
you know one of the things that we can

144
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:09,820
talk about in the wonderfulness of

145
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:13,299
mothership that are really appreciative

146
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:17,590
of their pipes is the thick basis the

147
00:14:13,299 --> 00:14:21,189
thick thick flat on bevel non rounded

148
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:22,840
like a flat thick base to me that is a

149
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:24,580
testament for the strength of these

150
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:27,310
pipes I can go around the base of this

151
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:30,970
right now and it feels security I can

152
00:14:27,309 --> 00:14:32,349
feel the ridges almost yeah yeah you're

153
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:34,779
not gonna put it around all the way it's

154
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:37,029
gonna fly no there's no wrong I mean I

155
00:14:34,779 --> 00:14:39,879
only have the one myself but it has a

156
00:14:37,029 --> 00:14:42,509
pretty big base for a mothership no you

157
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,509
have a really like

158
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:45,889
it's one of the things I appreciate I

159
00:14:44,059 --> 00:14:46,429
pay attention when I put my mothership

160
00:14:45,889 --> 00:14:49,189
down

161
00:14:46,429 --> 00:14:51,139
not for my mothership but for other

162
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:53,030
things on the table why and then if I

163
00:14:51,139 --> 00:15:00,340
put this down on any other type of glass

164
00:14:53,029 --> 00:15:02,480
of this kiboshed a break so bad I

165
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:04,030
figured I guess to me when I was talking

166
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,120
about patch 101

167

holding your hand with giant spikes with

169
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:52,220
big long spikes and twists and it makes

170
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,960
it very difficult to hold some of the

171
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:55,730
pieces I got a 42 but it's a beautiful

172
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:57,139
twos and I loved it it was a gift for my

173
00:15:55,730 --> 00:16:00,379
wife for Father's Day

174
00:15:57,139 --> 00:16:00,860
and it has labeled white for Father's

175
00:16:00,379 --> 00:16:02,809
Day

176
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:06,110
that's what flab gets for Father's Day

177
00:16:02,809 --> 00:16:09,109
and so it had almost one but I stopped

178
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:11,959
like twisting flame spikes coming up

179
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:13,730
inside of the entire structure of the

180
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:15,828
place so it's very hard you actually

181
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:18,829
have to fold on to the flames themselves

182
00:16:15,828 --> 00:16:20,509
and I had one friend if you could see it

183
00:16:18,828 --> 00:16:22,509
in his hand he was gripping it so father

184
00:16:20,509 --> 00:16:26,208
hadn't even put it down because

185

193
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:59,500
