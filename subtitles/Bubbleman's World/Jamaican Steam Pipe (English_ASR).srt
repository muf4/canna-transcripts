3
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:25,719
bubble man here live in negro Jamaica

00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:27,159
hanging out at the new Royal itall

5
00:00:25,719 --> 00:00:28,839
Kitchen that is actually yet to be

6
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:31,560
opened this going to be the juice bar

7
00:00:28,839 --> 00:00:34,519
back here and we're hanging out with uh

8
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:37,039
with Buffalo and red a Rastafarian Elder

9
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:38,719
who's lived in Negril for jeez as long

10
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:40,119
as he can remember we'll let him tell

11
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,800
you how long it's been but uh he's going

12
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:43,640
to be making a Jamaican steam pipe for

13
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:46,000
us today what we're doing is we're

14
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:48,399
trying to get to the uh The Roots origin

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,359
of the vaporizer pipe vaporizers are

16
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,840
quite popular these days amongst medical

17
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:55,640
users but also gaining popularity with

18
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:57,280
recreational users as well and uh the

19
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,878
some of the most efficient vaporizers

20
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,160
are hot air Delivery Systems that blow

21
00:00:59,878 --> 00:01:04,759
blow hot air over the Cannabis

22
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:06,359
vaporizing the resins allowing you to

23
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:09,520
inhale them as a vapor rather than a

24
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:12,039
smoke so as far as I'm concerned I've

25
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:14,039
yet to find a more original vaporizer

26
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:16,080
than the steam pipe in Jamaica as the

27
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,360
history goes I heard that a friend of

28
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:21,200
the skunk man's came here in the 70s and

29
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:23,359
was turned on possibly even by Red to

30
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,320
the Jamaican steam pipe and he went back

31
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:27,920
home to California to try and sort of uh

32
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:30,039
figure things out and see if he could

33
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,560
make his own version uh with with the

34
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:34,840
help of technology and the skunkman

35
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,960
offered him uh the idea of using a heat

36
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:39,759
gun and thus the vaporizer heat gun idea

37
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:42,199
was born and so many ideas have sort of

38
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,879
branched off from that idea I thought

39
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,240
wouldn't it be a great uh great thing if

40
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:48,478
we could show the viewers at pot TV the

41
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:50,118
original vaporizer so we're going to

42
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:52,560

the first time I saw a steam pipe

142
00:08:52,720 --> 00:09:00,800
uh first time I saw a steam pipe

143
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:03,480

144
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:03,479

150
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:27,519

151
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:31,120
raster a rter camp used to be in Harbor

mhm and

154
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:43,399
um so that's where I got the idea from

155
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:46,679
of the steam pipe he was making them

156
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:49,559
Elder Asters used to to they used to use

157
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:52,359
the steam pipes wow because the average

158
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:55,278
people on the street did not know about

159
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:57,480
steam pipe yeah even still even still

160
00:09:55,278 --> 00:10:00,240
and even most of the young RS and

161
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:02,800
otherwise didn't know steam p

162
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,720
right but the Elder rers knew of steam

163
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:06,639
pipes okay so they used to use their

164
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,879
steam

165
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:12,360
pipes well I had known of the of the of

166
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:15,039
the uh the other pipe that we call the

167
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:17,919
chill out right but I did not know about

168
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:20,879
the steam pipe

169
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:26,319
until about

170
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:31,039

here in Jamaica or whether it was no no

189
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:21,199
I have

190
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:24,439
seen I have

191
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:27,959
seen I've seen photographs of steam

192
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:32,079
pipes in magazines African magazines

193
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:37,000

194
00:11:32,078 --> 00:11:38,719
and um Ash I've seen Ash um Ash pipes

195
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,159
several tubes around where they have

196
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,360
they have steam pipes that are being

197
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:47,240
made that these have five or six tubes

198
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:49,560
that you can can draw from Wow right

199
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:52,159
interesting right so it's an African

200
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:53,199
thing beautiful you know in Africa they

201
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:55,600
really don't

202
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,720
smoke well no that's why I would have

203
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:01,920
guessed it was from India or something

204
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:06,399
it's it's a it's it's a Indian African

205
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:06,399
thing oh whatever it is it's a beautiful

206
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:13,560
thing it's really um in a sense

207
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:16,600
it's it's harm reduction yes it's very

208
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:20,518
isent it it reduces

209
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:22,720
smoke but Steed it's a nice

210
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:26,399

early '70s it was here in NE grill that

244

was the first and only place in Jamaica

245
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:25,479

246
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:28,079
welcome them yes because um when when

247
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:30,920
when the hippie start coming here you

248
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:34,758
know it's like they most of them landed

249
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:36,838
like M if they even land at Kingston

250
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:37,680
there was some vibration that draw them

251
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:40,160
to

252
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:42,039
NE right which was a small fishing

253
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:45,679
Village at the time just a small fishing

254
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:48,039
Village and but and we were young

255
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:51,278
wresters at that

256
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:53,919
time right right and the thing about it

257
00:14:51,278 --> 00:14:56,919
there wasn't so much other people

258
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:59,519
here that means when they came

259
00:14:56,919 --> 00:15:01,439
here we were the first first ones that

260
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,198
they met and we were very honest and

261
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,839
start showing about we used to be

262
00:15:03,198 --> 00:15:08,679
cooking itel food beautiful right so

263
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:11,800
they were interested in

264
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:13,958
um in learning how to to do it you know

265
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:16,359
and then and those days the hippie had

266
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:16,359
us to

267
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:22,600
hide I us to hide really from the cops

268
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:25,800
because they'll be here and over stay

269
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:30,079
and things like that mhm so we were the

270
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:33,120
one to help them to help them

271
00:15:30,078 --> 00:15:37,559
hide from the cops and the mountains and

272
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:41,679
things like that some of them run out of

273
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:41,679
money uh resters

274
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:51,318
were very generous more in those days I

275
00:15:46,318 --> 00:15:53,719
think you know sure so we cook and

276
00:15:51,318 --> 00:15:57,039
we or maybe there were just back in

277
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:58,920
those days there were less um divisions

278
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:02,759
and less wolves and sheep's clothing

279
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:05,958
there was there was there was no W yeah

280

w right red you know there was no Woods

282
00:16:10,198 --> 00:16:14,278

283
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:22,079
um yeah let me R

284
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:22,079
[Music]

285
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:31,399
it cutting a little hole in

286
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:33,919
there yeah yes has to receive the

287
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:35,440
stem but it's a way to do it if you

288
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:37,240
don't know what you're doing it doesn't

289
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,880
work properly I can believe it I'm

290
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:41,318
looking at watching you do it I can see

291
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:44,360
the way the bamboo splits

292
00:16:41,318 --> 00:16:45,519
lengthwise right you don't want it to

293
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,959
split too

294
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:52,159
much and after you have it on an and

295
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:54,399
roof and it apparently seems

296
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:57,480
like you want me to find you a stick or

297
00:16:54,399 --> 00:17:00,480
something to stick in there not

298

down that way I give it that slant that

326
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:58,960
we could get it in and down that it

327
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,720
could go down in the Water right all

328

water filter all right

331
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:11,879

332
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:14,880
it like

333
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,880
that

334
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:21,359
ah have it opened up ah so when you

335
00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:24,600
bubble when you dry it doesn't go up it

336
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:26,119
bubbles it bubbles around right right if

337
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:29,119

sense so okay say you're using the bow

453
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:51,839
sometimes right yes sometime it is made

454
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:54,278
from real tough bamboo this is tough so

455
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:56,678
sometimes when you use the fire on top

456
00:29:54,278 --> 00:29:59,440
of the bow it eventually Burns and

457
00:29:56,679 --> 00:30:01,798
crystallizes and have some little olds

458
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:05,159
and doesn't draw good okay because the

459
00:30:01,798 --> 00:30:08,319
pan is on top and ear is getting in okay

460
00:30:05,159 --> 00:30:10,600
yeah so you then you take it off and and

461
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:14,720
you rub it back smoothly smooth it up
