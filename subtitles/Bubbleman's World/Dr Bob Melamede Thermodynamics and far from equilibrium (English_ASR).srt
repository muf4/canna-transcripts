1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,470
[Music]

2
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:14,080
I would describing him as being a a free

3
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:16,160
spirit and a character and uh again I'd

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,600
like to thank him Alo we've been in

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,198
connection for almost five years onlyy

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,480
met him last night for the first time

7
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:23,840
that's part of the reasons why he's here

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,079
on this platform he brings another voice

9
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:28,118
to this space so it's wonderful to

10
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:30,159
actually get to meet him and uh have a

11
00:00:28,118 --> 00:00:34,799
drink with him last night and it's gives

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,799
me great pleasure to introduce Dr Bob

13
00:00:38,558 --> 00:00:43,238
n thank you Hut and thank everybody

14
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:45,960
especially the organizers because this

15
00:00:43,238 --> 00:00:47,959
is what has to happen everywhere around

16
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:51,920
the world and is happening everywhere

17
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:54,280
around the world thankfully so um what I

18
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:58,280
want to do is talk about things in a

19
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:59,960
very different fashion than um what most

20
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,079
people are accustomed to and in fact

21
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:04,159
what I really want to do is I want to

22
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:07,400
bring together the

23
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:10,080
spirituality with the science because in

24
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:12,799
fact anything that's true has to be true

25
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:15,079
for everything that's true so whatever

26
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:17,799
is real in spirituality whatever is real

27
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:21,359
in science there has to be a junction of

28
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:25,079
Truth between them and I feel very

29
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:27,438
satisfied personally with how I Now

30
00:01:25,078 --> 00:01:30,879
understand what I call the physics of

31
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:33,919
life because if we are going to try to

32
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:35,839
explore how to promote Health both in

33
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,640
terms of individual health but in terms

34
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:42,000
of Social and planetary Health we should

35
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,680
have some idea of what life is I don't

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,319
think anybody in this room would bring

37
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,840
their car to a mechanic who didn't know

38
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:50,559
how a car worked but we go to doctors

39
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,240
who don't really have a foundational

40
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,240
understanding of what life is and this

41
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:57,759
is true sadly of of our scientists and

42
00:01:55,239 --> 00:02:00,078
the whole scientific medical

43
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,759
establishment that that we all live live

44
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:06,879
under and The Tragic Truth that I've

45
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:10,520
come to realize for myself is that we

46
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:13,159
are living in a world of false use

47
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:16,200
Donald Trump's spr fake medicine and

48
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:19,400
fake uh fake science in many respects

49
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:21,959
because of how we have not moved beyond

50
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:25,039
the kind of thinking that really

51
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:27,560
represents 100 Years of wonderful

52
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:30,639
thinking and wonderful creativity but

53
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:33,280
never got us beyond the stagnation

54
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:36,318
of of the kind of Revolution that's

55
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,598
required in for us to move on to the

56
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:41,079
next level of humanity the the

57
00:02:38,598 --> 00:02:43,679
Consciousness that we've heard spoken of

58
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:46,560
and for me that is simply a natural

59
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,760
unfolding of an unfolding universe and

60
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:52,519
that's what I want to try to convey

61
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:55,158
these aspects uh of what is going on so

62
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:58,759
what I'd like everyone to do I figure

63
00:02:55,158 --> 00:03:01,598
out how to move my own thing here

64
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:03,679
um would be to basically forget what

65
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:06,959
you're thinking about what you think you

66
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,879
know and just go with what I have to say

67
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:12,319
don't over criticize it listen to the

68
00:03:09,878 --> 00:03:13,318
whole story as much as I'll be able to

69
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:14,839
get through because it's really

70
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:17,000
impossible to do it in this amount of

71
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:19,519
time it takes about two hours to give a

72
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,280
fairly full-fledged overview of what I'm

73
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:25,840
talking about but the aim is that the

74
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:28,360
kinds of details that for example Ethan

75
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,680
does a wonderful job of presenting and

76
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:33,439
they're so essential for us to

77
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:35,400
understand but what we need to do is

78
00:03:33,438 --> 00:03:38,239
understand them in the context of what

79
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,959
life is and how those things impinge on

80
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:43,360
that process and one of the overarching

81
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:46,400
themes that I'm going to talk about has

82
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:49,360
to do ultimately with the energy sources

83
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,640
that cells use to power themselves to

84
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,040
power life and to manifest itself in

85
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:56,839
everything and it turns out that those

86
00:03:54,039 --> 00:04:00,158
energy sources have profoundly different

87
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:03,200
uh values to them and the kind kind of

88
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:05,840
things if you look at literally all of

89
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:07,679
those various chemicals that you saw on

90
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,920
the board earlier today the Turk beans

91
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,519
and the flavonoids and all they all for

92
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:14,479
the most part have a common mode of

93
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:17,000
functioning even though we can look at

94
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:18,680
the specific Pathways if you stand back

95
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,560
and you say what's really going on

96
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:23,639
you'll see that most of them turn on fat

97
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,759
burning via kise and the magic of

98
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:27,240
turning on fat burning is that that's

99
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,120
when cells are

100
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,439
recycling and what they're doing is

101
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,240
they're Rec cycling their damaged pieces

102
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:35,199
and how were those pieces damaged they

103
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:38,199
were damaged when we made energy

104
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,319
efficiently by utilizing carbohydrates

105
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:42,360
and what's known as the electron

106
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:45,199
transport system so it's the dialogue

107
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:47,560
between doing things activating things

108
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:50,038
your muscles your your pancreas your

109
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:52,079
hormones your brain all of those things

110
00:04:50,038 --> 00:04:54,319
are always done with a foundational

111
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:56,198
activation of calcium and that has to do

112
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:58,279
with the origins of life so what I

113
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:59,879
really want to do is give you a flavor

114
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:02,959
for a different way of think thinking

115
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:04,918
and understanding what life is what life

116
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:07,839
is a part of because it's all part of

117
00:05:04,918 --> 00:05:10,879
this expansion this uh the unfolding of

118
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:14,319
the universe basically and we have been

119
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:16,680
part of a chemical reaction a chemical

120
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:19,199
reaction that has gone on since the

121
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,759
planet formed we we'll start there we

122
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,000
don't have to go back to the Big Bang

123
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:26,360
all right what I try to do is keep

124
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,800
theory in a functional mode because what

125
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:31,479
I'm interested in is life liberty in the

126
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,478
pursuit of happiness

127
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:39,080
so we will see where we get and all of

128
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:42,720
the physics the foundation of all of my

129
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:46,399
thinking comes from Noel lauan Ilia pin

130
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:50,319
who was one of the truly great Geniuses

131
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:53,679
that Humanity has created and um what he

132
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:57,479
does is he creates a whole new vision of

133
00:05:53,680 --> 00:06:01,360
just everyday reality we are involved in

134
00:05:57,478 --> 00:06:04,758
an unfolding of the universe and as it

135
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,400
unfolds it creates time it's not like

136
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:07,879
time is sitting there with the clock

137
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:10,239
because that's the way we're train to

138
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:12,598
think about it but there's a process of

139
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,439
unfolding and intrinsic in that process

140
00:06:12,598 --> 00:06:17,918
is the evolutionary process and in order

141
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:19,439
to have Evolution you have to power life

142
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:21,918
and in order to power life you need

143
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:24,478
these energy sources and it's the way

144
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:27,038
they work together the combination of

145
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:28,758
doing things and then protecting what

146
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:31,360
you're doing it's the same in society if

147
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:33,000
what we do is build and we don't recycle

148
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,400
and we don't care about the pollution

149
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,560
we're generating Society will collapse

150
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:40,799
the reason for that is because Society

151
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:43,079
is an echo of the physics of life so we

152
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,079
will

153
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:52,598
continue so a key concept here is that

154
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:54,840
life is a dynamic fractal now who who

155
00:06:52,598 --> 00:06:56,839
knows what a fractal is just so I get so

156
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:59,038
a lot of you know okay so I'm GNA I'm

157
00:06:56,839 --> 00:07:01,799
going to just give a quick picture here

158
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:07,240
actually a little quick movie of a of a

159
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:10,079
fractal I can get my neck together can't

160
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:12,360
Mo it should just be playing why is it

161
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:12,359
not

162
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,560
playing get out of this mode I guess I

163
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:29,000
don't know where I am it came up in an

164
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:31,439
unusual place and I didn't fix it anyway

165
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,160
maybe I'll just have to bypass the movie

166
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:37,800
which is a shame it's a nice

167
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,800
movie here we go can

168
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:46,839
do so when a fract

169
00:07:44,918 --> 00:07:48,719
oops I got

170
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:51,638
it oh

171
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:54,199
well oh now I have to torture myself

172
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:54,199
more

173
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:01,038
why there's always something maybe I

174
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:04,560
should just move on anyway a fractal is

175
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:07,519
an algorithm whereby it generates a

176
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:10,319
picture an image of some sort and it so

177
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:13,478
happens that the algorithm allows you to

178
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:16,080
reiterate the the math and it'll

179
00:08:13,478 --> 00:08:17,560
regenerate images so you can like scope

180
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:20,519
in like you could look at a little piece

181
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:22,519
of my ear and bring it up and you see

182
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:23,839
another ear and then if you look closely

183
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:26,478
you see another ear and you bring it up

184
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:29,560
you see another ear okay so it'll repeat

185
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:32,679
patterns by a mathematical algorithm so

186
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:34,958
what I'm proposing is that we look at

187
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:37,598
let's see if I can get anything oh no

188
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:39,879
I'm going to have to fool around with it

189
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:43,000
a dynamic fractal and what what a

190
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:45,679
dynamic fractal in my version of reality

191
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,159
is is that every time you reiterate that

192
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:50,039
algorithm you change it and what do you

193
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:52,360
change it based on you change it based

194
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:54,480
on your first algorithm changed the

195
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,200
environment the environment changed you

196
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,440
if you want to adapt you now have to

197
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,839
change back to the environment that you

198
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,920
changed so it is this constant process

199
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:05,720
of unfolding and that's what evolution

200
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:08,559
is and we again are all part of this big

201
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:10,920
chemistry set but we make the mistake we

202
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:13,679
have the illusion that we are

203
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:15,639
individuals and in fact the way I look

204
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:17,359
at things is I look at the planet the

205
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:19,799
big chemistry set and within that

206
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,600
chemistry set you have the biochemistry

207
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:25,679
of humanity and within the biochemistry

208
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:28,399
of humanity that there are certain rules

209
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:31,799
as to what's going on in this unfolding

210
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:35,159
process as we get smarter a key concept

211
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:37,919
here is that it's not that we evolve in

212
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:42,480
time it's that Evolution the power the

213
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:44,799
flow of energy generates the time and

214
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,639
equilibrium which is the way most of our

215
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:50,359
physics and most of our chemistry has as

216
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:54,199
its Origins what's called reversibility

217
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:57,240
of time because that allowed simple math

218
00:09:54,200 --> 00:10:00,200
and that simple math allowed for a very

219
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:02,278
powerful development of of of Concepts

220
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,480
in the field in particular say

221
00:10:02,278 --> 00:10:06,639
thermodynamics but it was all based on

222
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,000
equilibrium when you have equilibrium

223
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:11,078
you don't have flow and you don't have

224
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,958
time because everything's already done

225
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:15,958
at equilibrium so there's a new field of

226
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:17,799
physics and this is what pene created

227
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:19,879
called far from equilibrium

228
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:22,479
thermodynamics so it's what happens when

229
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:24,759
energy is flowing and in order to

230
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,680
formalize that mathematically so that

231
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:28,720
you can have like the logical proofs

232
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:31,199
that everybody will universally accept

233
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,320
they had to actually create new math in

234
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,759
order to break the symmetry of time

235
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:37,480
because the physics that we're taught in

236
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:39,559
our schools says time can go backwards

237
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:41,200
well are you getting younger when's the

238
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:43,078
last time you drove your car and the gas

239
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,160
tank filled up you know those things

240
00:10:43,078 --> 00:10:48,958
don't happen there is an arrow to time

241
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:52,278
and what pin's work was did was he broke

242
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:54,518
the symmetry so now we no longer have

243
00:10:52,278 --> 00:10:57,679
this reversability of time we have an

244
00:10:54,519 --> 00:11:00,440
unfolding of time and that unfolding is

245
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:02,759
driven by the flow of energy keeping us

246
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:04,440
further from equilibrium so a summary

247
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:07,360
statement that's very important I think

248
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:10,160
for people to understand is that health

249
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,399
is defined in my mind at least by our

250
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:15,319
distance from

251
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:17,240
equilibrium and as we age we return back

252
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:20,519
to equilibrium the complexity the

253
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:23,000
negative entropy of our chemistry

254
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:25,679
decreases and what I want to talk about

255
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:29,559
is how that's happening why that's

256
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:32,039
happening how the energy of our food the

257
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:35,759
fat versus the carbohydrates has a

258
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:38,719
profound impact on the ultimate outcome

259
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:41,278
and I apply these things to myself as

260
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,440
well uh just so we have a reference

261
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:45,838
point here I've been using cannabis for

262
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,720
53 years on a daily basis I start the

263
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,279
day by eating at least 100 milligrams of

264
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:51,759
oil and I do that a few more times

265
00:11:49,278 --> 00:11:54,958
throughout the day but I've reversed a

266
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:57,200
lot of my conditions by combining my

267
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:59,559
cannabis use with my neutrals that

268
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:03,360
ultimately manipulate metabolism I will

269
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:06,439
be 70 years old in December right I feel

270
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,440
that I have been

271
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,800
successful you know I I have a lot of

272
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:14,159
pain I have a lot of things going on

273
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:17,599
I've got my whole body is arthritic you

274
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:19,799
know I'm H B27 you know what that means

275
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,079
I don't have analing spondilitis because

276
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:24,159
I've used cannabis my whole life I am

277
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:26,638
positive for the rid Factor I've got

278
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:30,480
Gout I've on and on and on but you see

279
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:33,039
I'm fine I can go right M you know

280
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,399
because I apply not just cannabis but

281
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:38,319
everything else that I'm telling you

282
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,320
about all right

283
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:43,759
so these are Concepts that I want you to

284
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:45,639
start to think about because these are

285
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:47,559
not things that we think about and

286
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:50,440
they're rather mindblowing

287
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:53,359
so um first of all there's about 50

288
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:55,399
billion tons of DNA on the planet so

289
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:58,399
we're talking about a very successful

290
00:12:55,399 --> 00:13:00,480
molecule all right and then every day a

291
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,519
person makes approximately their own

292
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,920
body weight in

293
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:06,560
ATP well you know that seems to be a

294
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:08,879
little bit of a how can I be making that

295
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:11,919
much of ATP when I'm not getting bigger

296
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:14,600
you know it's flow you make you break

297
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:17,159
you make you break you make you break

298
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:20,120
okay and that's what flow we are flow

299
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:22,639
dependent structures that's what pin got

300
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:24,399
his Nobel prize for the concepts and the

301
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:29,240
math and the understanding of what flow

302
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:32,360
dependent structures are so a human cell

303
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:34,278
has about 2 meters of DNA in it and if

304
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:35,600
you took all the DNA from a person and

305
00:13:34,278 --> 00:13:38,799
you stretch it out it would go from here

306
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:42,079
to the Sun and back 400 times think

307
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:46,039
about that how small this stuff is every

308
00:13:42,078 --> 00:13:48,719
one of your cells has a two yards of DNA

309
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:51,000
in it 2 meters of DNA think of what must

310
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,519
go on when that cell replicates because

311
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,958
you can't even see the cell and you got

312
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:56,480
two meters of stuff twined up in there

313
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:57,919
that's got to replicate you can't make

314
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,639
mistakes or you come down with cancer

315
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:02,078
and other illnesses

316
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:05,039
so this is total lunacy when you think

317
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:07,519
about what I'm saying here and then to

318
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:10,399
top all that off a single free radical

319
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:13,959
molecule could kill you a single

320
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:17,078
molecule one time could kill you all

321
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:19,518
right why because if that molecule hit a

322
00:14:17,078 --> 00:14:21,519
critical base in a critical Gene that

323
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:23,679
was controlling cell division and your

324
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:26,000
DNA repair system didn't see it and your

325
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:28,958
antioxidants didn't quench it before the

326
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,559
did the damage and your then your IM

327
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:33,278
system doesn't see that you now have a

328
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:34,758
cancer cell and then you go and you do

329
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:37,000
chemo and that selects for drug

330
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:38,639
resistance we'll go into that and then

331
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,600
you finally go back to cannabis and if

332
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,959
you're lucky you're able to overcome the

333
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,879
Damage Done by the chemo and if you're

334
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:47,679
lucky you get rid of everything but this

335
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:50,120
it's not that simple and I I've got

336
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:52,719
about 90 YouTubes out there that

337
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:55,799
describe a different version of reality

338
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:58,759
my version either I'm insane or

339
00:14:55,799 --> 00:15:01,240
everybody else is insane all right and

340
00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:03,800
it's open for

341
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:07,320
debate but I'm very confident in what I

342
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:09,679
know because I it's so integrated and

343
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:11,399
it's always answering all the questions

344
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:13,039
that are asked when I read all of the

345
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:16,360
papers that I read which is all I do I

346
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:18,039
sit around stone I'm ad I got the TV on

347
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,600
I got the computer on my lap and I read

348
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:20,759
all day every day other than being a

349
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,360
slave with my

350
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:24,959
children

351
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:28,120
so all right now it gets even crazier

352
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:32,399
one molecule can kill you everyone of

353
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:36,480
your 15 trillion cells every day

354
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:40,480
sustains 20,000 of the damages where one

355
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:43,240
in one cell one time could kill you what

356
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,240
does that suggest to you to me it says

357
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:48,519
we must have an incredible amount of

358
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:50,240
biochemical complexity devoted to

359
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:52,799
preventing us from dying from all the

360
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,839
free radicals we're making and I believe

361
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:57,879
absolutely that is the answer and it's

362
00:15:54,839 --> 00:16:01,319
the free radicals that guide everything

363
00:15:57,879 --> 00:16:03,919
because as we do things we make them as

364
00:16:01,318 --> 00:16:06,120
we make them we create damages DNA RNA

365
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:08,039
proteins fats everything gets oxidized

366
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:10,639
by or reduced depending on the type of

367
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:13,958
free Radical by free radicals they react

368
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:16,600
with everything all right

369
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:19,399
so what we want to be able to do is keep

370
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:21,480
that at a sustainable level where we're

371
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:23,639
able to fix the damages that are caused

372
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:27,079
by the free radicals and a rate

373
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:28,799
proportional somewhat to how how much

374
00:16:27,078 --> 00:16:30,638
we're creating it's kind of think of

375
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:32,879
your bathtub you know you have a if you

376
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,639
have the water running and it's going

377
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:36,120
out the outflow if you have it right you

378
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:39,039
can just keep it going right but if you

379
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:40,440
have too much water it'll overflow or if

380
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:41,958
you had the plug out you know and you

381
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:45,120
weren't keeping it right it'll it'll

382
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:47,318
drain right we are the same way we are

383
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,560
filled with the organization of Life the

384
00:16:47,318 --> 00:16:52,198
Holy Spirit if you will but it's not a

385
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:55,359
static entity it's a flowing entity

386
00:16:52,198 --> 00:16:57,479
coming from you know as coming from the

387
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:02,159
universe it's all part of this

388
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:04,279
continuity all right so half of us in my

389
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:06,119
mind is meaning on a cellular

390
00:17:04,279 --> 00:17:08,318
biochemical level is devoted for us to

391
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:10,198
do things and the other half is devoted

392
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:12,318
for us to be able to fix the things so

393
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:14,640
we can keep doing things we have to keep

394
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:17,519
growing we have to keep moving further

395
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,600
from equilibrium your chronological age

396
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:22,400
is not what matters the fact that I'm 70

397
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:25,519
is not what matters how far am I from

398
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,199
equilibrium is what matters and you know

399
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:28,839
you could be 6 years old and Dy because

400
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,440
you're Clos to equilibrium you can be a

401
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:32,279
100 years old riding a horse running

402
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:34,360
around because you're further from

403
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:36,798
equilibrium all right that's what it all

404
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:40,639
is it's all about organization that's

405
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:43,639
maintained by the flow of energy through

406
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,640
you

407
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:49,400
so and these are some quotes that just

408
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:52,160
really capture the concept of this

409
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:53,960
constant creativity you know when when

410
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:57,400
when the Bible says man's created in

411
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:58,919
God's image well what is God's image

412
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:01,240
creation

413
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:04,200
creativity see for me God is generalized

414
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:07,279
Open System Dynamics the flow of energy

415
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,880
right but it doesn't matter because no

416
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:10,720
matter what your religion is people it

417
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,240
will accept science to a certain degree

418
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,640
you know most people will not walk in

419
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,519
front of a car because they have some

420
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:19,200
concept of momentum you know falling off

421
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:21,319
a roof they understand gravity you know

422
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,159
so what I'm saying is that once

423
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:24,960
everybody understands what I'm

424
00:18:23,159 --> 00:18:28,880
suggesting if I'm right I'm not totally

425
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:31,120
insane or maybe both or neither then we

426
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,880
will see a transition occurring because

427
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:35,719
what we are as individuals are not

428
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:38,480
individuals other than that we are

429
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:40,558
quantized probes of that Collective

430
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,480
human biochemistry and what are we

431
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:45,200
probes for

432
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,919
adaptability that's what evolution Works

433
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,038
off of adaptability you're not the

434
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:50,640
biggest you're not the strongest you're

435
00:18:49,038 --> 00:18:52,599
the most adaptable you're not the

436
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,679
smartest none of that is what matters

437
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:56,439
it's how it all comes together so you

438
00:18:54,679 --> 00:18:58,759
can adapt to survive and that's what

439
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:01,360
your cells are trying to do all the time

440
00:18:58,759 --> 00:19:03,640
as we keep trying to do things and kill

441
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:05,240
ourselves in the process so one of the

442
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,720
most important take-home messages I'm

443
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:09,679
going to say it right now before I

444
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:12,558
forget because I'm a total Airhead all

445
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:15,480
right is that you have to shift your

446
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:17,960
balance of carbohydrate intake and fat

447
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:20,880
intake you want to take more healthy

448
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:22,919
fats and less carbohydrates especially

449
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,320
like you should never drink sod any of

450
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:27,600
that crap that's just like ridiculous

451
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:29,759
nonsense for your body all it does is

452
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:33,240
promote free rical doesn't give you any

453
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:36,480
help and it helps all the age related

454
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:38,759
illnesses diabetes heart disease think

455
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,798
about it use a little Common Sense are

456
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:43,240
you going to have clogged arteries if

457
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:46,400
you're burning fat if the fat is what

458
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:48,240
clogs your arteries no but what you

459
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,000
don't know because it's not generally

460
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:53,679
accepted as reality but happens to be

461
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:56,240
fully 100% true is guess what you make

462
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:58,320
fat out of

463
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,279
carbohydrates and why do you make the

464
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:02,079
fats out of the carbohydrates so you

465
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:03,440
won't burn them and make too many free

466
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:05,798
radicals and kill

467
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,919
yourself but it turns out that that fat

468
00:20:05,798 --> 00:20:10,519
is proinflammatory as well so it's only

469
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:12,280
a temporary solution and other solutions

470
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:14,200
that our cells have to not die from

471
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:16,319
producing too many free radicals is

472
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:19,279
they'll make fibers so your fibrotic

473
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:22,759
diseases are all an effort of your cells

474
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:24,798
to stay alive because either by genetic

475
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:27,279
mechanisms because of your problems

476
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:28,839
genetic problems or because of your life

477
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:31,279
history in particular the food you eat

478
00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:33,000
and the toxins you were exposed to that

479
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:35,599
is what leads into these problems that

480
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,200
have to then be recycled burnt up and

481
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:40,639
gotten rid of but you can only do that

482
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:43,600
if you're building enough and recycling

483
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:45,480
in an appropriate fashion all right so

484
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:47,359
anyway the more deeply we study the

485
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:49,919
nature of time the better we understand

486
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:53,359
that duration means invention creations

487
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:56,038
of forms continuous elaboration of the

488
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:58,639
absolutely new because this second is

489
00:20:56,038 --> 00:21:01,960
different than that second and that is

490
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,640
the absolutely new that manifests itself

491
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,919
in life and

492
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:08,280
evolution and another one of his saying

493
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:11,559
is we are actually the children of the

494
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:13,839
arrow of time of evolution not its

495
00:21:11,558 --> 00:21:16,918
progenitors and this refers to for those

496
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:19,399
of you in you know quantum theory where

497
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:21,360
Schrodinger's Box you know you have you

498
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:23,798
have a cat in the box and you throw some

499
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:25,639
cyanide in but you know the cat is not

500
00:21:23,798 --> 00:21:27,720
dead or alive until you make the

501
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:30,320
measurement that's the foundation of

502
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:32,839
this reversible time based physics which

503
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:37,519
Prine blows out of the water with what

504
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:39,519
he's done so the it means that we don't

505
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:42,000
create Time by making a measurement

506
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:46,319
we're part of this unfolding

507
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:48,480
process so here's an an example of one

508
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:50,519
of these flow dependent structures this

509
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,558
is an example of something that is

510
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:54,359
counterintuitive to us what you're

511
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:57,798
seeing is a liquid in a peaker dish so

512
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:59,839
there about 10 MLS okay which me amount

513
00:21:57,798 --> 00:22:00,798
to like 10 to 20 something molecules

514
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:03,240
we're talking about billions and

515
00:22:00,798 --> 00:22:06,119
trillions of molecules and when you heat

516
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:08,079
them what every what we're all taught in

517
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:09,759
school is that the molecules will move

518
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:12,158
faster they'll rotate faster if there's

519
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:14,919
a reaction will occur faster what we are

520
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:16,720
not taught is at all the possibility

521
00:22:14,919 --> 00:22:19,120
that something like this could occur and

522
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:22,200
it's the spontaneous formation of

523
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:24,399
organized hexagonal convection cells

524
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:26,519
what what I mean is

525
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:29,240
this I'm taking that and turning it on

526
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:31,158
its side so you're heating it below the

527
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:34,240
hot molecules are going up the side of

528
00:22:31,159 --> 00:22:36,200
the hexagon giving their heat up above

529
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,240
and then the cooled ones are coming

530
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:40,600
through the center and you're forming

531
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:44,440
like a Bucket Brigade for

532
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:47,719
heat how can that happen it happens

533
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:50,720
because by those structures forming they

534
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:52,679
are generating more entropy more waste

535
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,079
to the universe the simple way to

536
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:58,038
remember it is collections of molecules

537
00:22:55,079 --> 00:23:00,558
like us will get smarter as long as we

538
00:22:58,038 --> 00:23:03,480
can make the universe stupider

539
00:23:00,558 --> 00:23:06,079
quickly all right that's the way things

540
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:07,599
work that's reality right so in this

541
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:09,918
case here we're looking at a thermal

542
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:12,519
gradient generating the organization in

543
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:14,720
the next slide you're seeing a Redux

544
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:16,278
reaction a reaction where chemicals have

545
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,960
electrons that they want to give to

546
00:23:16,278 --> 00:23:19,919
something else and something else wants

547
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:22,360
to take them that's electricity all

548
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:24,440
right bio El electricity we call

549
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:26,558
redox so what you're seeing here is

550
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:28,640
another petri dish and chemicals were

551
00:23:26,558 --> 00:23:29,558
mixed together and thrown in in there

552
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,080
and

553
00:23:29,558 --> 00:23:33,879
spontaneously organization occurs you

554
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:35,918
can see the organization because there's

555
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:37,559
an indicator in there that tells you

556
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:38,880
whether the molecules are oxidized to

557
00:23:37,558 --> 00:23:41,480
reduced so you see that there's a

558
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:43,480
heterogen they're not all the same even

559
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:46,240
though we would expect it to be all the

560
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:48,720
same it's a liquid so what's going on

561
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:51,679
there all right it's showing you that

562
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,558
flowing energy organizes matter and by

563
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:55,880
doing that it's making that reaction

564
00:23:53,558 --> 00:23:57,558
occur more rapidly so that in the end

565
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:59,559
the potential is dissipated to the

566
00:23:57,558 --> 00:24:01,759
universe ierse quicker made the universe

567
00:23:59,558 --> 00:24:03,839
stupider quicker all

568
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:06,640
right so now I'm going to show you a

569
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:09,240
little video of it this one of the

570
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:11,120
reactions I did in in the lab and you'll

571
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:12,558
see the color starting the bottom of the

572
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:14,558
tube because when you do it in a test

573
00:24:12,558 --> 00:24:15,960
tube it's more three-dimensional but

574
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:17,480
there's another factor that I want to

575
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:20,200
emphasize to you when this thing finally

576
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:22,200
starts happening you it'll move up from

577
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:26,798
the bottom come

578
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:30,399
on come on I should shorten this

579
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:33,398
video is it working maybe it wasn't

580
00:24:30,398 --> 00:24:33,398
working oh

581
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:41,720
no it sounds like it's working but oh

582
00:24:37,398 --> 00:24:44,918
there you go oh you have it and I don't

583
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:47,558
okay so what you'll see is obviously

584
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:49,799
it's random right there's no possibility

585
00:24:47,558 --> 00:24:51,440
that there's any organization left and

586
00:24:49,798 --> 00:24:53,798
from the bottom there you'll see a blue

587
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,840
color which indicates reduced molecules

588
00:24:53,798 --> 00:24:58,038
and you'll see that it'll move up and

589
00:24:55,839 --> 00:25:00,158
disappear and then come back there it

590
00:24:58,038 --> 00:25:02,919
goes and then it'll come back and do it

591
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:05,440
again these are periodic reactions

592
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:07,960
driven by the fact that you have slow

593
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,960
potential of electrons and matter gets

594
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:11,798
organized but what you think what you're

595
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:14,360
seeing think about there are two things

596
00:25:11,798 --> 00:25:16,480
you're seeing organization in space and

597
00:25:14,359 --> 00:25:19,519
you're seeing organization and time as

598
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:21,480
it comes and it goes we are nothing but

599
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:23,639
cycles of coming and going of

600
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:26,079
oscillations of reactions and

601
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:29,799
chemistries and electronics everything

602
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:31,918
vibrating together all right and what

603
00:25:29,798 --> 00:25:33,960
you're seeing if you think about it you

604
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:36,440
got your heart rate right that's a

605
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:38,440
temporal structure a structure in time

606
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:41,640
you got your breathing you got menstrual

607
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:43,600
cycles all of these things are natural

608
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:45,759
oscillations that come to a point where

609
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:48,038
we can kind of measure them and see them

610
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:50,119
but on a subcellular level for any of

611
00:25:48,038 --> 00:25:53,200
you who've taken psychedelics and mahasa

612
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:55,759
and LSD and you know the flowing Cosmic

613
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:58,399
beauty of like psychedelics that's what

614
00:25:55,759 --> 00:26:00,679
it looks like in yourselves

615
00:25:58,398 --> 00:26:02,719
that's what's going on it's that Harmony

616
00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:05,120
where everything's moving with

617
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:07,480
everything else weaving together and

618
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:10,079
it's all driven by the flow of energy

619
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:11,640
stop beating you die stop beating you

620
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:13,879
you you know the structure the flow

621
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:15,360
dependent structure goes away that's

622
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:17,120
what death is it's a far from

623
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:19,879
equilibrium phase

624
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:22,398
change back to a state of lower

625
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:25,679
organization so whatever if there's

626
00:26:22,398 --> 00:26:28,038
anything with Spirit somehow that that's

627
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:30,960
captured okay I don't understand s

628
00:26:28,038 --> 00:26:33,119
enough but I'm open to

629
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,440
everything so what I'm going to show you

630
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:38,398
in a second is a metabolic

631
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:41,919
map anybody remember

632
00:26:38,398 --> 00:26:44,519
that now the the problem with this map

633
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:44,520
is it's too

634
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:50,720
simple literally because what they what

635
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:53,320
you're looking at here is a snapshot in

636
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:56,159
time you're not seeing any flow

637
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:58,278
therefore there is no time okay so what

638
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:00,720
you're seeing are all these possible

639
00:26:58,278 --> 00:27:02,119
chemical reactions in their linkages but

640
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,480
what you're missing is the thing that

641
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:07,678
makes it alive and what makes it alive

642
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:10,200
is when it's flowing all of those things

643
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:12,000
every one of those points has an enzyme

644
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,399
that allows the reaction to occur

645
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,558
because the reactions in your body would

646
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:16,839
not occur unless you had enzymes that

647
00:27:15,558 --> 00:27:18,480
allowed them to occur in room

648
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:22,000
temperature okay otherwise we would not

649
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:24,038
be here okay so all of those things have

650
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,679
enzymes all of those enzymes are

651
00:27:24,038 --> 00:27:28,200
controlled in terms of their function in

652
00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:30,720
terms of their trans

653
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:33,278
translation from RNA in terms of

654
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:35,278
transcription from DNA to RNA and in

655
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:37,880
terms of the genetic architecture of the

656
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:40,519
DNA as to whether something's available

657
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:43,679
to be expressed or not so the whole

658
00:27:40,519 --> 00:27:45,519
thing that makes that alive is missing

659
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:48,200
all right and yet this is we're not

660
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:50,519
taught that aspect we're taught oh we're

661
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:52,159
get this metabolic map know well this is

662
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:53,880
nonsense unless you can make it and

663
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:55,399
relate it to

664
00:27:53,880 --> 00:28:00,120
life

665
00:27:55,398 --> 00:28:04,199
and what we'll see is that our cannaboid

666
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:07,599
system is the overall regulator of

667
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:09,919
everything in your body from conception

668
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:11,959
until death so your immune system

669
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:14,200
digestive system cardiovascular system

670
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:16,000
skin bones muscle

671
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:19,240
everything is

672
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,519
regulated from conception until death

673
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:22,159
every time you get hungry it's because

674
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:24,640
your brain makes into canids you give

675
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:28,640
yourself the munchies the reason the

676
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:31,880
plant works is because it's how you work

677
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:34,120
and this plan can tap into how you work

678
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:35,919
and the reason Pharmaceuticals are total

679
00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:37,918
[ __ ] for the most part is because

680
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:40,278
they're founded on the wrong principles

681
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:42,200
and I say that using a pharmaceutical

682
00:28:40,278 --> 00:28:45,359
every day that's keeping my heart in

683
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:47,038
Rhythm all right but that there's so

684
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:48,359
much more that I can't talk about

685
00:28:47,038 --> 00:28:52,038
related to that just we don't of the

686
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:54,119
time but the point here is that what we

687
00:28:52,038 --> 00:28:57,038
have to be able to do is manipulate our

688
00:28:54,119 --> 00:28:59,639
biochemical flow in a way that keeps us

689
00:28:57,038 --> 00:29:01,720
further from equilibrium and as we age

690
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:04,600
what happens is the weakest link in our

691
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:07,440
flow dependent biochemistry is what gets

692
00:29:04,599 --> 00:29:09,480
us all right my genetics makes it all

693
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:13,038
this inflammatory crap that I deal with

694
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:14,720
all right had I had other diets and

695
00:29:13,038 --> 00:29:16,200
things that I do I probably be dead now

696
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:19,558
with a heart

697
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:21,080
attack but thankfully I'm not so you

698
00:29:19,558 --> 00:29:22,720
know again back to the Psychedelic

699
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:25,639
picture you know you want all that

700
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:28,519
harmonizing flow and you don't want too

701
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:30,278
much disruption

702
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:33,919
all

703
00:29:30,278 --> 00:29:36,038
right so Evolution n life naturally

704
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:38,720
selects for survival of flow dependent

705
00:29:36,038 --> 00:29:40,640
structures through adaptation as long as

706
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:43,240
adaptable conditions and sufficient time

707
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,880
is allowed okay where I want to go with

708
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:47,679
this as I want to point out some things

709
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:50,640
that I believe are incredibly important

710
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:52,919
and totally revolutionary and sadly the

711
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,799
scientists will not talk with me about

712
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:56,880
it because I've rejected them and

713
00:29:54,798 --> 00:29:58,879
they've rejected me and I'm happy with

714
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,320
the separ ation in general other than

715
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,519
the fact that if they knew more of what

716
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:04,359
I know we would all be better off

717
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:05,759
because instead of pedaling poison we'd

718
00:30:04,359 --> 00:30:08,000
be able to start manipulating the

719
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:10,000
biochemical flow when you make

720
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,398
xenobiotics the way the chem the

721
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,919
pharmaceutical companies are making

722
00:30:11,398 --> 00:30:15,879
chemicals all right for long time I

723
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:17,038
didn't you know I it didn't bother me

724
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:19,240
that much I'm thinking all right so you

725
00:30:17,038 --> 00:30:21,640
have this chemical it's going to do this

726
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:23,880
then it finally dawned on me well if you

727
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:25,679
don't have the pathways to synthesize

728
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:28,120
the chemical and you don't have the

729
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:30,919
pathways to break down the chem is part

730
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:33,119
of the normal healthy flow what happens

731
00:30:30,919 --> 00:30:34,799
well they'll get broken down by means by

732
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:37,079
which we get rid of you know some of our

733
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:39,278
garbage but you don't know what products

734
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:40,678
are going to be made along the way you

735
00:30:39,278 --> 00:30:41,880
don't know where they're going to go and

736
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:43,798
what they're going to do because they've

737
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:46,480
never been part of the flow they haven't

738
00:30:43,798 --> 00:30:49,558
had selective pressures working on them

739
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:51,759
so for the most part they're not going

740
00:30:49,558 --> 00:30:54,440
to work other than to generate side

741
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:56,440
effects and give you temporary belief

742
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:58,200
and this one of the one of the really

743
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:00,519
scary examples of that is with

744
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:02,480
chemotherapy because and there's

745
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:04,399
peer-reviewed literature showing you

746
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,599
what you do is you select for the drug

747
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:08,079
resistance and let me explain what that

748
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:09,519
means in my mind because that's

749
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:12,000
completely different what what it means

750
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:14,960
in everybody else's mind all

751
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,638
right your cells in order for them to

752
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:19,558
live have to constantly be adapting to

753
00:31:17,638 --> 00:31:22,638
their environment they've got to be

754
00:31:19,558 --> 00:31:23,918
either muscling or thinking or seeing or

755
00:31:22,638 --> 00:31:26,158
smelling or whatever they're doing

756
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:28,960
they're doing something

757
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:32,080
okay they have to be able to

758
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:34,919
know when they have to what they have to

759
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:37,199
do to adapt so there's like a layer of

760
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:39,038
of how we deal with free radicals

761
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,919
because when we use the electron

762
00:31:39,038 --> 00:31:43,359
transport system we make energy

763
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:44,720
efficiently but we make it dangerously

764
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:46,558
because that's where most of our free

765
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,278
radicals come from so we have this

766
00:31:46,558 --> 00:31:50,798
dichotomy we want it we need it that's

767
00:31:48,278 --> 00:31:53,278
what powers Evolution and that's in my

768
00:31:50,798 --> 00:31:56,839
mind what powered the evolution of

769
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:59,599
humanity it was the cv1 receptor which

770
00:31:56,839 --> 00:32:01,638
first appeared with the

771
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:05,158
vertebrates not invertebrates

772
00:32:01,638 --> 00:32:07,398
vertebrates okay once we got our brains

773
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:10,399
in the vertebrates we had the CB1

774
00:32:07,398 --> 00:32:12,239
receptor and what we what it does on a

775
00:32:10,398 --> 00:32:13,759
molecular level if you understand how

776
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,720
things work and all the other stuff

777
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:18,480
starts to become apparent to you what

778
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:20,519
what the cv1 receptor does is it

779
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,000
regulates calcium channels among other

780
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:23,278
things but the calcium channels are

781
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,319
important because they activate

782
00:32:23,278 --> 00:32:27,278
everything and if you're eating too much

783
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:28,638
sugar and then the calcium is part of

784
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:30,679
the signaling that's saying to the

785
00:32:28,638 --> 00:32:32,719
mitochondria you know burn more sugar

786
00:32:30,679 --> 00:32:34,919
burn more sugar but then you make these

787
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:37,440
free radicals and the system adjusts to

788
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:39,399
it all right because remember the system

789
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:42,759
half of it is just to survive the free

790
00:32:39,398 --> 00:32:45,079
radicals so it's adjusting to what's

791
00:32:42,759 --> 00:32:47,720
going on by shifting all the biochemical

792
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:48,879
flows so think of a road map a city you

793
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,960
want to get from here to the other side

794
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,159
of the city you got all those

795
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:54,840
possibilities some are high speed some

796
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:57,399
are slow speed some are broken that's

797
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:59,918
the way it's going through you the flow

798
00:32:57,398 --> 00:33:01,759
okay and what you want to do is to be

799
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:04,519
able to optimally get from one side of

800
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:06,398
the city to the other without damaging

801
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:09,558
everything and with that in some proper

802
00:33:06,398 --> 00:33:11,599
time so what the pharmaceutical industry

803
00:33:09,558 --> 00:33:14,200
in general is doing is working on the

804
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:16,678
level of the differentiated cell the

805
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:20,880
cell that's communicating with its

806
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:23,240
environment and putting out more ideally

807
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:25,960
uh entropy and taking in negative

808
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:28,960
entropy order okay

809
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,960
but

810
00:33:36,679 --> 00:33:42,240
when you turn on recycling what the

811
00:33:38,919 --> 00:33:44,759
cells do is they stop talking to their

812
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,319
environment and they say I've got enough

813
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:48,759
problems that I got to cool what I'm

814
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:52,158
doing and I got to fix me it's kind of

815
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:52,158
like Trump for president in a

816
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:58,440
sense America no cell first the cell is

817
00:33:56,278 --> 00:34:00,200
now to saying I don't want to deal with

818
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:03,840
the world anymore I'm going to fix

819
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:07,000
myself and if that can occur then that

820
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:09,199
cell can go on to live a healthy part of

821
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,280
you or if it can't if it does it but it

822
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:12,398
doesn't do it in the right way then it

823
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:14,960
becomes a cancer cell or misguided

824
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:18,279
immune cell for autoimmune diseases etc

825
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:20,519
etc etc ultimately all age related

826
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:23,040
illnesses come from these excess free

827
00:34:20,519 --> 00:34:26,079
radicals so where was I going with all

828
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:27,878
of this yeah so your electron transport

829
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:30,039
system remember one molecule can kill

830
00:34:27,878 --> 00:34:33,078
you every year you make about four

831
00:34:30,039 --> 00:34:35,119
kilogram of superoxide which is a free

832
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:37,399
radical and which is again why I

833
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:40,519
emphasize how much of what we are has to

834
00:34:37,398 --> 00:34:43,319
be designed to protect us and guess what

835
00:34:40,519 --> 00:34:45,960
that's why I'm here because we're now

836
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:48,079
going from I'm explaining why we can

837
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:50,079
manipulate things on a biochemical basis

838
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:53,639
but how do we do it we have to know we

839
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:57,280
can do it and then we have to go and do

840
00:34:53,639 --> 00:35:00,519
it so that's all part of the system

841
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:03,400
getting smarter and what's happening now

842
00:35:00,519 --> 00:35:05,280
is the Earth the chemistry set of the

843
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:08,160
planet is undergoing a far from

844
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:10,119
equilibrium phase change and what that

845
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:13,639
means is we see our weather patterns

846
00:35:10,119 --> 00:35:15,358
changing we see our financial situ see

847
00:35:13,639 --> 00:35:16,799
before a phase change occurs before

848
00:35:15,358 --> 00:35:18,598
there's a far from equilibrium phase

849
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,440
change the variables of the system

850
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:23,240
instead of vibrating like this they

851
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:24,599
start to go crazy and we're seeing that

852
00:35:23,239 --> 00:35:26,279
everywhere in the world right now we're

853
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:27,320
see it in our Pol politics we're see it

854
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,960
in our finan

855
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:31,480
we're seeing the tides we're seeing the

856
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:33,720
weather so the planet is undergoing a

857
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:37,119
rearrangement and what I believe is that

858
00:35:33,719 --> 00:35:39,358
rearrangement is part of our Evolution

859
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:41,200
as well and that I don't know how many

860
00:35:39,358 --> 00:35:43,039
of you know my blip blip story you know

861
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:44,719
you can divide the world into two two

862
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:47,079
categories of people people who have

863
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:48,559
above average cannaboid activity and

864
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:51,200
people who have less than average

865
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:53,000
cannaboid activity now if you don't make

866
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:55,799
enough so you're more unstoned what's

867
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,760
that going to mean anxious uptight

868
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:00,560
fearful you know all the crap we see

869
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:02,960
because the people who run the world are

870
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:05,519
what I call Blitz backward looking cedo

871
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:07,199
fishing people and you know the Bible

872
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:08,639
says it the meek shall inherit the earth

873
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:11,000
well who are the meek and they the

874
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:12,639
stoner said all right so you only stuck

875
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:16,960
me in jail for 20 years you didn't give

876
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:18,838
me life [ __ ] you is my answer you know I

877
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,800
mean this is just ludicrous we're

878
00:36:18,838 --> 00:36:22,799
talking about a god-given plan whatever

879
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,920
God you want to talk about we're talking

880
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:27,318
about growing lettuce in our backyard

881
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:29,639
I'll shut up

882
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:29,639
we're

883
00:36:39,559 --> 00:36:47,358
done CB2 turns on fat burning CB1 allows

884
00:36:44,679 --> 00:36:48,799
you to burn sugar safely that's why your

885
00:36:47,358 --> 00:36:51,159
brain needed it because it's so

886
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:53,000
organized it'll fry without it it's

887
00:36:51,159 --> 00:36:55,960
always hot anyway it can't get any

888
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:58,079
hotter all right so sugar burning your

889
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:59,358
heart 6 % of it comes from fat burning

890
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:02,119
why make free radicals when you don't

891
00:36:59,358 --> 00:37:05,719
need them stem cells burn fat that's why

892
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:07,079
they don't age you need CB1 to turn on

893
00:37:05,719 --> 00:37:09,259
electron transport so they can

894
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:19,959
differentiate make neurons and

895
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:19,959
[Applause]

896
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:29,639
bl as you can see this man has a great

897
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,640
deal of

898
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:36,960
energy he's not and he's not going

899
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:38,440
anyway he's here all day so please uh

900
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:41,079
catch him at the lunch break cuz I know

901
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:44,000
he'll love to talk

902
00:37:41,079 --> 00:37:47,000
more there a lot

903
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Bo
