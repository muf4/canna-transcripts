1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:05,160
all right so we're here with Matt the

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,560
great Gardener and uh he's going to tell

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:10,440
us a little bit about what's going on

4
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:13,558
here so here we have the high CBD

5
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:17,198
caramels made with canonic

6
00:00:13,558 --> 00:00:20,839
butter uh we had surveyed the members of

7
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:24,160
the club asking them what they most were

8
00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:26,039
looking for in an edible and uh the

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,839
elderly

10
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:30,759
population uh had mentioned that they

11
00:00:28,839 --> 00:00:34,320
wanted something that they could suck on

12
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:36,359
due to the fact that most of them uh had

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,200
dentures and it was hard for them to

14
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:41,000
chew on things so they wanted something

15
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:43,359
that they can just suck on and be uh

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,198
easy for intake so we came up with a

17
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:50,238
caramel idea Infuse the butter into

18
00:00:46,198 --> 00:00:52,280
caramel wrap them up into individual uh

19
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:54,519
little candies I would wouldn't call

20
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:56,520
them candies I would call them uh

21
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,719
medicinals Edibles

22
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,280
medibles yeah they're quite nice I've

23
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:03,000
had a few in the last couple couple of

24
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:05,680
days um the reason I have my licenses

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,560
for severe arthritis for my broken bones

26
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,240
and my collar bone often bugs me as

27
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,759
particularly when I'm doing photography

28
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:13,478
and holding my arm up and uh yeah these

29
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:17,000
were great just kind of melted away the

30
00:01:13,478 --> 00:01:19,799
pain and uh for me anyway I wasn't it

31
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,280
didn't really make me tired or groggy or

32
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:24,680
I didn't really have any feelings of

33
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:27,040
being overly uh baked as you would say I

34
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:30,400
just kind of was able to go on with my

35
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:33,600
day with less complaining about uh

36
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:36,359
