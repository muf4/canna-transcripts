the rain but uh it's going to get a lot

14
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:57,238
better once it starts to cool down you

15
00:00:55,479 --> 00:00:59,000
know yeah so we were talking on hash

16
00:00:57,238 --> 00:01:00,599
church about uh how many events they

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,518
were having in a row

18
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,679
and now doesn't I feel doesn't it feel

19
00:01:02,518 --> 00:01:05,359
better to just kind of have like all

20
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:09,000
right there's a SoCal and a North Cow

21
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:11,920
just two a year oh oh most definitely

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,400
yeah it's just like it just like it gets

23
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,879
watered down having it so often you know

24
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,719
people are going to them every week and

25
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:20,078
it just starts to burn it out I feel

26
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:22,319
like it becomes more of a reward getting

27
00:01:20,078 --> 00:01:24,438
getting to go to these things you know

28
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:28,438
every so often like you look forward to

29
00:01:24,438 --> 00:01:29,719
it you know it allows us to network uh

30
00:01:28,438 --> 00:01:31,478
and it's almost like a little Retreat

31
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:33,118
like if you do it the right way which

32
00:01:31,478 --> 00:01:35,399

00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,639
favorite day cuz I get to sample

53
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:17,640
everything yeah so a lot of people also

54
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:19,919
um don't don't know you also make hash

55
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:21,679
rosin too right correct yeah and water

56
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:24,280
hash and water hash of course so not

57
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,840
just flower rosin and uh you were

58
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,479
showing off a little bit earlier over

59
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,640
here and so pick out your uh if you had

60
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:35,039
to give me your best dab of the hash

61
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:37,479
rosin um or say just of your say resin

62
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:40,878
category and oil category cuz anything

63
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:42,560
that's press hash you know would be oil

64
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:44,679
so give me give me your best hash and

65
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,800
give me your best oil doing some dabs

66
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:50,239
right on let's do

67
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:53,439
it let me get the uh let's get the 159

68
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:57,120
through 73 OG glue bubble hash and then

69
00:02:53,439 --> 00:03:00,560
uh let's do the uh orange cookies OG

70
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:03,680
glue live RZ and flow RZ and blend so I

71
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,560
like to blend the rosins too you know so

72
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,680
rather than just

73
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:11,280
uh rather than just having uh you know

74
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:14,200
flour rosin or live rosin or you know

75
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:17,318
just one specific strain having the oils

76
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:19,238
and being able to blend I feel like uh

77
00:03:17,318 --> 00:03:20,839
create you're you're you're basically

78
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:22,400
able to kind of create your own flavor

79
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,878
in a sense so are you are you actually

80
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:28,158
mixing the flow rosin and the hash rosin

81
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:29,280
yes together yes okay so it's like uh I

82
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:30,798
haven't really played with doing the

83
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,280
live Ros or the hash rosin and the

84
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,640
flower rosin mixes but I mean they work

85
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,239
really well cuz a lot of the times the

86
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:39,279
hashin talking about this uh the other

87
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:41,560
day cuz we made a why we call it our

88
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,840
grease is we're taking bubble hash rosin

89
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,039
with tpin and then there's flower rosin

90
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,640
with tpin and they're distinctively two

91
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:50,199
different totally

92
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:52,479
different everything from from uh the

93
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:56,280
texture to the to the you know the

94
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:59,399
visual to the to the experience 100% and

95
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,120
uh as far as taste too you know that's

96
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,158
cool we're all kind of I was talking

97
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,480
with Frenchie last night too everyone

98
00:04:03,158 --> 00:04:07,639
that's really into you know into their

99
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:09,878
own into their own like type of making a

100
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:11,318
pass it's like chefs you know it's like

101
00:04:09,878 --> 00:04:13,719
if I was Italian chef and he was a

102
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:15,399
friend Chef you know and you and You'

103
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:17,199
like establish yourself as chefs and

104
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,639
you're kind of creating Your Own Way

105
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,560
exactly it's like an art that's why it's

106
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,120
like an art you know it's because that's

107
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,399
where it's like it's it takes that

108
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:26,319
creative mind to take the steps to play

109
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:28,599
with it you know you go out of the box

110
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:30,240
you try new things rather than following

111
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:33,039
what you learn and what you what you

112
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,960
think is the best you you explore you

113
00:04:33,038 --> 00:04:36,519
know and that's what's fun about it and

114
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:38,359
meeting the other people and all the

115
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:40,240
others that are doing the same thing

116
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:43,800
it's it's great all right so now that we

117
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,840
know you're making uh Creations what

118
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:48,120
what' you pick out for me to try orange

119
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:50,239
cookies is up first so right here we got

120
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,120
some orange cookies this the orange

121
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,400
cookies flow Rin blended with the OG

122
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:56,639
glue live rosin there's your okay and

123
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:58,439
explain live rosin to to the audience

124
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,759
what that is exactly what are you what

125
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:02,079
exactly are you doing that makes that

126
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,919
live R okay so first of all we are not

127
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:07,279
pressing fresh frozen buds it doesn't

128
00:05:04,918 --> 00:05:09,399
work when you press fresh plant I mean

129
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:12,879
some people may have some techniques or

130
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:16,159
tricks to it but as far as like the best

131
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:18,079
ways and uh the most common way that's

132
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,960
going to end up sticking I would say is

133
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:24,519
going to be to wash the fresh frozen

134
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:26,159
into a to a water hash drying it and

135
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:27,318
then pressing that I mean that's really

136
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,240
that's what live rosin is that's what

137
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:32,000
live rosin is and really basically fresh

138
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,439
Frozen full milk fresh Frozen full milk

139
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,918
pressed into rosin that's what our

140
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:37,360
grease is the wash and squash 100%

141
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:40,159
that's what our grease is

142
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,560
yeah I mean it's as close as live rosin

143
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,880
you can get for the for the rosin side

144
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,120
you know what was that orange cookies

145
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:48,759
yeah it tasted like an orange soda with

146
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,000
like hints of uh sugar

147
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:53,919
cookies here Phil this is ready that's

148
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,399
interesting cuz that tastes more like a

149
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:58,639
a that tastes more like a really clean

150
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:01,159
hash oil it's a way cool way you combine

151
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,038
that

152
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,960
I felt it to my front of my head like

153
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:08,399

165
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:33,680
everyone's dabs so we got some covering

166
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:36,038
I'm taking it upon myself to try all the

167
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,519
dabs that he would be trying yeah okay

168
00:06:36,038 --> 00:06:40,839
here's your OG

169
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:44,079
icex so this one's for you B man OG og

170
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:46,279
ice wag this one's for the B man buddy

171
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:46,279
yeah

172
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:57,199
buddy rocking that soil grown dab oh

173
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,199
yeah it's immediately so much

174
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:04,959
stronger that's a hash it oh yeah I feel

175
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,919
like the water hash wow definitely has

176
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:09,439
the

177
00:07:06,918 --> 00:07:12,799
most expansion on the

178
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:12,800
lungs heavy

179
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,720
High almost a more Full Spectrum

180
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:21,719
High rather than just like the the flow

181
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,120
R and noticeable is like when you smoke

182
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,479
hash and people think of

183
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,478
chal old school way of smoking hash you

184
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:30,560
Genera a lot of carbet a lot of smoke

185
00:07:27,478 --> 00:07:33,598
yes so from the flower live ra and

186
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,598
really clean a lot of less a lot of less

187
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:38,360
smoke so a different way of expanding

188
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:41,120
the lungs it's almost like a pure way to

189
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,800
hit the collap laries this one hash is

190
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,079
like a little bit more Smokey so it

191
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,000
blows it up and gives you that old

192
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:49,198
school exp don't need as much smoke but

193
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,038
we're used to taking the same size hit

194
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,038
so now we take that same hit and it hits

195
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:55,639
us harder cuz we're used to a cleaner

196
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:58,199
smoke half that size exactly well and

197
00:07:55,639 --> 00:08:00,280
when you're doing oil it's yeah exactly

198
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:01,879
there's less contamin in it less carbon

199
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:03,318
and I feel like that's why and most

200
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:05,080
people like that are out there what I

201
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:08,520
like to do is when I heat my quartz or

202
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:10,800
silicone carbine or have it on a my uh

203
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:12,279
nail or something the most important

204
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,319
thing is that when you're anytime you're

205
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:15,918
dabbing full Mo you press it out I

206
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,560
always bring it into where the heat

207
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:20,279
source is test the side of whatever

208
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,399
element dish that you're using and if it

209
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:23,878
starts to nicely melt and bubble right

210
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:25,719
there then you know the temperature is

211
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:27,639
right to go ahead and drop it and let it

212
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:29,000
fall into the rest of the dish if you

213
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:31,038
see any kind of burn or a little

214
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,918
Browning sorry that's an indication to

215
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:36,158
pull back and wait and wait 15 seconds

216
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:39,439
or more and then try it again and once

217
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:40,599
it hits the side of that dish um and it

218
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,760
starts to Bubble then you know you have

219
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:43,158
the right and that's something I'll do

220
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:46,080
often times when I'm like I'm about to

221
00:08:43,158 --> 00:08:47,838
do a dab and I forget like the time or

222
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,480
how long I was counting I'm like oh I'll

223
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,240
give it a little tap and it kind of

224
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:54,200
gives you an idea like oh you see that

225
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:56,360
little tap it just stays nice and clear

226
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,720
oil rather than charring so that's why I

227
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,600
think that's why I think people don't

228
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:02,240
understand that or appreciate for first

229
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:05,560
run 30 second or one minute agitation

230
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,399
runs getting the first most beautiful uh

231
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:10,759
array of tricomes is that first shaking

232
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:12,839
of the tree to get those tricomes in one

233
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:14,439
uh first wash right and then you get

234
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:16,320
that you're looking for this five or six

235
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:19,079
star so when you get that you're getting

236
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,879
these like volumptuous like on a macro

237
00:09:19,078 --> 00:09:23,000
level grapes these perfectly preserved

238
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:25,439
heads that are fitting a certain screen

239
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,120
size on the first agitation and it's a

240
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:31,040
delicacy and it's expensive and you got

241
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:32,480
to take smaller dabs pressed out thin

242
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:34,799
and you have to be able to do that dab

243
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,159
test with any kind of heat source so

244
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:37,719
that way you can actually have this

245
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:39,519
medicine last a lot longer and

246
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,959
appreciate it better yeah most and those

247
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,720
short runs you know you're you're

248
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:45,359
capturing those heads that dissolve the

249
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,800
fastest that's why you want to get those

250
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,278
and short quick

251
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:51,479
runs I feel like no I feel like that's

252
00:09:50,278 --> 00:09:53,439
how you're going to capture a lot of

253
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,039
those tpin you know especially in the

254
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,000
water has yeah I was going to say I

255
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:59,559
really appreciate the way that you're

256
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,559
also looking at tpin uh and how you're

257
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:03,319
preserving them in your process whether

258
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:05,639
we're using Sash and a lot of the times

259
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,839
when people you know the collaboration

260
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:10,199
really that we're doing is we're using

261
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:12,079
the sasquash V1 and the V2 with a

262
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,399
California air now that's uh in a

263
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:16,319
complete but it's in a silence box oh no

264
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,360
[ __ ] and it has a flow adapter so every

265
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,519
time you hit it keeps that 80 on the

266
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,759
pedal and it kind of hits the whole time

267
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:24,919
and there's no sound and so that allows

268
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:26,838
us to control the plate temps you could

269
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:29,319
always shut the f top one off or keep it

270
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:31,680
to 100 and the other one at 180 so even

271
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,640
even with flower rosin to simulate the

272
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:35,000
effect of the V1 cuz there's certain

273
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:37,000
things that I like about the V1

274
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,399
especially with hash is that colder

275
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,278
plate on top sometimes it down temping

276
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:43,799
allows it to do something different than

277
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:45,159
having a constant heat you that's

278
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:47,359
awesome dude and you see that's like

279
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:49,319
that's the experimentation with like

280
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,399
each individual artist themselves you

281
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:53,560
know they decide to go well I'm going to

282
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:55,399
try this instead of just sticking to the

283
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:56,838
same and that's what's beautiful about

284
00:10:55,399 --> 00:11:00,759
it and that's where we stumble upon

285
00:10:56,839 --> 00:11:03,160
these new new textures and just new new

286
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:05,240
versions of the oil and it's just it

287
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:07,759
that's what's great about this dude most

288
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:09,240
definitely yeah so I'm excited for uh

289
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:11,838
what's to come with you you got a really

290
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:14,320
strong fam and uh the stash squash is

291
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:17,440
doing good we use it for piranha we use

292
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:20,760
it for uh bubbleman Blue River

293
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,639
collaborations um I thoroughly enjoy it

294
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:24,360
I stand by the product I you know when

295
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:26,200
you're pushing pounds and pressing

296
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,000
pounds all day long over and over and

297
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,800
over and over that's when you find out

298
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,519
if you have something that works yeah

299
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:33,719
most definitely dude it's built to allow

300
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:36,320
us to be artist it's the Beast dude it's

301
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:38,000
S I mean it's for production it's for

302
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,240
boutique it's for however you want with

303
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,039
this machine you can manipulate it it's

304
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:46,000
full control if you want to press water

305
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:48,559
hash and you need to press very very

306
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,399
slow I mean you can lower the PSI on

307
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:52,799
your compressor yeah and and you can

308
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,639
have full control of the speed as well

309
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:57,278
as the temperatures and and you know

310
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,519
it's uh as well as the strength of it so

311
00:11:57,278 --> 00:12:01,000
so whatever you want to press if you

312
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:03,839
want to throw in in a quarter pound and

313
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
you want to go crazy you can do so but

314
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,279
you know that's a whole another that's a

315
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,480
whole

316
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:11,360
another ball game you know you have

317
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,920
production level and you have more of a

318
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,839
connoisseur level yeah we call it

319
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:16,719
artisanal or Boutique cuz we always do

320
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:18,480
things and we finally were able to get

321
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,120
some of our stuff out and like we got 50

322
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,278
gr of a Jack Frost we were jumping up

323
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:23,600
and down it's 100 half grams just

324
00:12:22,278 --> 00:12:25,919
because trying to get that kind of

325
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,879
quality into production is really hard

326
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:30,000
but if we didn't have sasquash and a

327
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:31,159
team and kind of this in for the last

328
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,679
year we wouldn't be able to start

329
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:35,719
getting into that so it's hard sometimes

330
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:38,198
when you're like an artist and you uh

331
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:40,000
get stumbled upon with your tools you

332
00:12:38,198 --> 00:12:42,078
know so I have to give my hats off to

333
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,559
like using the right tools makes it a

334
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:46,159
lot easier to be able to develop these

335
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:47,838
different type of new techniques as well

336
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:50,399
now I think tools are an important part

337
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:52,720
of the trade having proper tools having

338
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:56,000
the right resources allows you to have

339
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:58,440
an advantage in this uh this part of the

340
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,198
industry yeah and then finally the most

341
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:03,399
important part is is the quality of the

342
00:13:00,198 --> 00:13:06,799
herb so 100% everyone's like oh I got

343
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:08,720
this like trim with like Smalls can you

344
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:10,759
press this out let me know same thing

345
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,519
with turps it's like well I mean I

346
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:14,639
really want to take the oranges from the

347
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:17,159
tree when they're ripe and perfect big

348
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,720
oranges not these little baby ones or

349
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:20,759
not the ones that got rotten and fell to

350
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:24,120
the ground or not just the

351
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:26,000
peels you know so you're only as good as

352
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,799
the farmer so like you got the tools

353
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,120
down you got the skills down and if

354
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:31,078
somebody doesn't give you good FL

355
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,560
flowers there's nothing you can do about

356
00:13:31,078 --> 00:13:34,679
it that's a whole another part of the

357
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:37,039
game is being a a turp hunter you know

358
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:40,559
you got to find that quality and a lot

359
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:43,759
of people uh claim to to have it and do

360
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:44,679
it but you know it's it's really it's

361
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:47,399
it's

362
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:49,120
really not that easy to find you really

363
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:50,759
got to look around and and you got to

364
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,399
look past all the [ __ ] and all the

365
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:54,000
hype cuz there is a lot of hype now when

366
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,480
I talk to Farmers you're like so what

367
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,078
did it test what's the microbes what's

368
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,600
the pesticides oh I didn't test that

369
00:13:57,078 --> 00:14:01,519
you're like all right well when you do

370
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,360
let me know give me all the reports test

371
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,159
a couple different batches of it and

372
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,360
those are really that's like super

373
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:08,799
important especially when you're dealing

374
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:10,278
with this this is I look at this as a as

375
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:12,240
a tester as well it's like give me an

376
00:14:10,278 --> 00:14:14,480
ounce of your material if youve passed

377
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,519
all of your pesticides and microbes and

378
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,079
everything like cool give me an ounce of

379
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:21,600
your material if I press it out and it's

380
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:24,359
like 5% something's wrong with the resin

381
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,079
it's not us it's not the machine and you

382
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,759
know what and I don't always blame the

383
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:30,958
grower because there's a lot of times

384
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:33,680
where for instance this uh the Sunny D I

385
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:36,239
mean it only put out 10% but the the

386
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:39,278
other strains I got from the grower I

387
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:41,320
mean I I hit as far as like 25% you know

388
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:44,120
so it's like there's phenomenal strains

389
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:46,278
but some strains just don't produce the

390
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,879
oil or the heads just don't feel they

391
00:14:46,278 --> 00:14:49,759
just don't feel like the others you know

392
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:51,480
so yeah they could be um when you look

393
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:53,639
at sometimes there's uh different types

394
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:55,560
of varieties where there's stocks that

395
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:57,600
line up in perfect grids and they're

396
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:59,399
spaced with bigger heads and then

397
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,519
there's stocks that line up very tightly

398
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:04,559
and take up every space with tiny little

399
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:06,198
heads and when you go to wash resin uh

400
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:07,758
it's very hard cuz it'd be like a lemon

401
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:09,240
tree that was solid full of lemons on

402
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:11,879
the outside that made it harder for them

403
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:13,959
to move okay and so these little tiny

404
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:16,600
heads can come off like almost like

405
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:18,039
harder raisins right and when you get

406
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,600
into something like this I found the

407
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:22,439
moisture content the time the length the

408
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,399
heat you could get pretty good at trying

409
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,800
to get as what what you can out of it

410
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,240
but it is like a fruit that sometimes

411
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:29,919
doesn't want to be squished and so you

412
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,759
have to find different ways and uses of

413
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:34,679
those varieties um or or they get phased

414
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:36,600
out from that's it if if you're if

415
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:38,198
you're working for concentrates and it's

416
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,639
not working for you and that's what you

417
00:15:38,198 --> 00:15:42,159
do okay but if you do it for flowers

418
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,919
sometimes those flowers are very

419
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:46,360
enjoyable just cuz they don't produce as

420
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:48,360
much oil so what was in the orange soda

421
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:51,639
cuz it tasted like like an orange zesty

422
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:54,039
soda so that was a orange cookies uh

423
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:57,680
flow rosin blended with the OG glue live

424
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:59,559
rosin OG glue live rosin okay yeah that

425
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:01,278
was good

426
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:02,479
well I appreciate uh hanging out and

427
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:05,600
everything did you do did you enter

428
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,278
anything into the I didn't n it was

429
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,480
really short notice like I knew this was

430
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:11,318
coming but I wasn't sure whether or not

431
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:13,879
I was going to be here been real busy

432
00:16:11,318 --> 00:16:16,399
with like a lot of the other projects so

433
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:18,318
uh I kind of scr to get stuff ready for

434
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:20,240
this this was like a last minute thing

435
00:16:18,318 --> 00:16:22,559
staying up till late in the morning

436
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:25,759

it out just to be here you know but

438
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:30,360
uh definitely I'm going to be entering

439
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:33,240
in some of these events this year

440
