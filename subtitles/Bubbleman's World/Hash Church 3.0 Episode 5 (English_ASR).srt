wild to kind of

41
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:17,610
a situation where the winter is over and

42
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:19,829
people are kind of like getting ready to

43
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:21,510
you know do all this stuff plant those

44
00:02:19,829 --> 00:02:23,280
seeds get the crops going

45
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:26,628
we got farmer Tom in the house I'm sure

46
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,919
he's been preparing yes sir

47
00:02:26,628 --> 00:02:30,328
you've been on a cool little well I

48
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:32,009
guess you're probably not traveling

49
00:02:30,329 --> 00:02:33,719
anymore but you were traveling for a

50
00:02:32,009 --> 00:02:36,598
while cruising around teaching the good

51
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:39,060
word of hemp yeah it's been going pretty

52
00:02:36,598 --> 00:02:41,339
well I've been doing these a hemp 101

53
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:44,848
the good the bad and the ugly we learned

54
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:48,000
a lot last year what to do what not to

55
00:02:44,848 --> 00:02:50,459
do where the bottlenecks were and you

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,009
know people get solid information right

57
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:55,979
now I'm in Puerto Rico working with some

58
00:02:53,009 --> 00:02:59,638
farmers down here to help them in some

59
00:02:55,979 --> 00:03:01,560
different you know pet projects so and

60
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:03,450
working with the local medical growers

61
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:08,000
down here they got a pretty robust

62
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:10,919
medical system down here in Puerto Rico

63
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,389
and they really embraced the day up you

64
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:14,789
know all the doctors are recommending

65
00:03:12,389 --> 00:03:17,010
cannabis to patients not just certain

66
00:03:14,789 --> 00:03:19,409
doctors and it's good to see the

67
00:03:17,009 --> 00:03:21,328
enthusiasm down here about a medical

68
00:03:19,409 --> 00:03:23,189
program and they're so excited about it

69
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:25,349
and you know kind of reminds me of the

70
00:03:23,189 --> 00:03:28,408
good old days you know I mean first in

71
00:03:25,348 --> 00:03:32,759
Washington and what's legalization came

72
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:34,858
the toe went sour and so what's going on

73
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:36,509
so what we're seeing and then Oregon was

74
00:03:34,859 --> 00:03:38,579
all fired up so I spent a lot of time

75
00:03:36,509 --> 00:03:41,668
there but they're kind of getting sour

76
00:03:38,579 --> 00:03:44,040
and so puerto rico's everybody's still

77
00:03:41,669 --> 00:03:46,229
fired up it's keeping me fired up and as

78
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:47,969
far as the farm goes you know we've got

79
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:48,569
all of our seeds secured for the next

80
00:03:47,969 --> 00:03:51,478
two years

81
00:03:48,568 --> 00:03:53,219
we've got enough potting mix and seed

82
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:56,359
starter mix to get us through the next

83
00:03:53,219 --> 00:03:58,859
couple of years and I just got my

84
00:03:56,359 --> 00:04:01,379
ingredients from concentrates Northwest

85
00:03:58,859 --> 00:04:03,629
in Portland secured those on Friday so

86
00:04:01,378 --> 00:04:06,209
I'm feeling really comfortable about

87
00:04:03,628 --> 00:04:08,878
what's coming on and I'm looking forward

88
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:11,098
to the future both on my farm and down

89
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:12,628
here in Puerto Rico well I love that

90
00:04:11,098 --> 00:04:14,969
you're out there doing that man I feel

91
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:17,548
like a lot of farmers especially in the

92
00:04:14,969 --> 00:04:19,738
u.s. right now need to know what not to

93
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:21,988
do almost as much as they need to know

94
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:24,449
what to do I feel bad that people are

95
00:04:21,988 --> 00:04:25,899
getting scammed out of shitty seed that

96
00:04:24,449 --> 00:04:27,639
they're growing and ending up

97
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:29,079
fitting into the regulations or it's

98
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:31,389
just not the seed that was said that

99
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:33,609
they were supposed to grow and just sort

100
00:04:31,389 --> 00:04:35,918
of all this you know this pipe dream

101
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:38,319
vibe that just needs to be kind of put

102
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:40,149
into context and hey listen this is this

103
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:42,639
is hard work it can be done if you do it

104
00:04:40,149 --> 00:04:45,000
right but you just see so many people

105
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:49,269
you know potentially losing their shirts

106
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,728
making last year in southern or again a

107
00:04:49,269 --> 00:04:53,288
lot of these investors left once they

108
00:04:51,728 --> 00:04:54,699
found out about the weather and

109
00:04:53,288 --> 00:04:56,740
everything they left a bunch of these

110
00:04:54,699 --> 00:04:59,770
farmers to fend for themselves so a lot

111
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:01,240
of stuff rotted in the field and you

112
00:04:59,769 --> 00:05:03,069
know and they had a lot of mold down

113
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,168
there of course it was the worst season

114
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:07,000
we've had and I don't know how long

115
00:05:05,168 --> 00:05:10,689
hopefully this year it looks like to be

116
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,279
a better year and I just don't like to

117
00:05:10,689 --> 00:05:14,288
see people ripped off either you know

118
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:16,659
what we really teach is how to vet these

119
00:05:14,288 --> 00:05:18,819
guys out how to do your due diligence

120
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:21,130
how to ask the right questions how to

121
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:24,189
contact other farmers who have used

122
00:05:21,129 --> 00:05:25,719
these guys you want three C of A's for

123
00:05:24,189 --> 00:05:27,370
C's to show they've done the proper

124
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,560
beating practices and done their due

125
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:31,538
diligence so there's not hermaphrodites

126
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,728
and doesn't cost all these issues you

127
00:05:31,538 --> 00:05:36,639
know the only good thing about last year

128
00:05:33,728 --> 00:05:38,139
is it really kind of thinned out the

129
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,569
riffraff you know what I mean it was a

130
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:42,250
horrible year nobody's doing well with

131
00:05:40,569 --> 00:05:44,889
it and it kind of got the people R in it

132
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:46,779
just for the money out of the game and

133
00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:49,870
it kind of you know real farmers were

134
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:51,549
prepared and we take the precaution we

135
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:53,530
don't pack our fields we allow for

136
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:55,389
ventilation we allow all these things

137
00:05:53,529 --> 00:05:58,359
they're key components to having a

138
00:05:55,389 --> 00:06:00,668
successful crop and farmers just are no

139
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:03,310
strangers to devastation like the way

140
00:06:00,668 --> 00:06:06,038
money people are money money people hit

141
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:07,750
devastation and they are gone farmers

142
00:06:06,038 --> 00:06:11,079
hit devastation and they start planting

143
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:12,728
for next year exactly you know you've

144
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:14,589
already done your due diligence in your

145
00:06:12,728 --> 00:06:18,908
field you prepared for the worst like we

146
00:06:14,589 --> 00:06:21,038
do every year and well you know we're

147
00:06:18,908 --> 00:06:22,538
and being a cannabis farmers and

148
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:25,000
cannabis people in general I've been

149
00:06:22,538 --> 00:06:27,459
talking about this a lot lately we're

150
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,800
used to adversity we're like Gumby like

151
00:06:27,459 --> 00:06:32,408
man we can contort each way we'll figure

152
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:34,840
out a way you know and our model is man

153
00:06:32,408 --> 00:06:36,579
there's always work around for

154
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:37,778
everything out there so that's the

155
00:06:36,579 --> 00:06:38,569
message I'm putting out there for

156
00:06:37,778 --> 00:06:41,509
everybody

157
00:06:38,569 --> 00:06:43,939
think outside the box look outside the

158
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:44,870
bubble see how you can do it differently

159
00:06:43,939 --> 00:06:47,420
and you'll get it

160
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:49,069
cannabis and hemp farmers were literally

161
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:51,259
bred for this

162
00:06:49,069 --> 00:06:53,719
I mean farmers in their own right have

163
00:06:51,259 --> 00:06:55,699
that aspect of you know understanding

164
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,710
weather and terroir and and all of these

165
00:06:55,699 --> 00:06:59,449
things but then there's cannabis farmers

166
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:03,049
who also have had to deal with

167
00:06:59,449 --> 00:07:05,089
prohibition the police a lifetime of

168
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:08,060

I'm such a tenacious person I thought I

180
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:39,500
would try to stream this live on

181
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:41,360
Facebook as well but it is also not

182
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,459
working that's okay because we're

hour ago or you just well we have I've

276

278
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:13,000
been able to go live on YouTube

279
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:15,669
unfortunately so what I'm gonna do is

280
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:21,789
I'm just gonna post it so people can

281
00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:26,828

282
00:12:21,789 --> 00:12:29,919
variety going I don't have a mount ehe

283
00:12:26,828 --> 00:12:39,189
CBD variety I thought you were playing

284
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:41,379
with one now my Corona cure is THC P of

285
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:44,529
which you've patented and it's now

286
00:12:41,379 --> 00:12:48,689
available to us right all right several

287
00:12:44,528 --> 00:12:51,519
years ago before they discovered THC P

288
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:52,839
it's kind of what I figured I could I I

289
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,980
didn't think it would take you long to

290
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:58,380
have a kilo of it you know I

291
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:02,700
heads I wouldn't expect him and his team

292
00:12:58,379 --> 00:13:05,340
not to you know Patel I thought the

293
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:06,900
other day of a cool show idea would be I

294
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:08,519
mean I don't know how it would work you

295
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:10,740
you almost have to get Rick over there

296
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:14,819
or something but you have such an

297
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:17,279
incredible collection of cannabis museum

298
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:19,770
type things that it would be cool to go

299
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:21,480
through just a small amount of it one

300
00:13:19,769 --> 00:13:23,759
day like things that you wanted to share

301
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:25,710
you know and just have someone like Rick

302
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:27,269
on camera being like oh and this is you

303
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:29,009
know you in the background explaining it

304
00:13:27,269 --> 00:13:31,319
cuz for anyone that's ever been to Sam's

305
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:33,179
house emini he inevitably will always

306
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:35,160
disappear off to this little back room

307
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:36,509
and then come back something cool and it

308
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:39,299
could just be anything it could be a

309
00:13:36,509 --> 00:13:41,850
silly DEA patch you know for a

310
00:13:39,299 --> 00:13:43,949
particular year against cannabis growers

311
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:45,629
or it could be you know two thousand six

312
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:48,840
hundred year old cannabis seeds from a

313
00:13:45,629 --> 00:13:50,700
grave site and in near some old tomb or

314
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:52,710
something but it's just neat stuff and

315
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:56,220
he has an enormous amount of it and he

316
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:58,650
has a really great knowledge on on what

317
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:02,129
it all is be I think it would be a cool

318
00:13:58,649 --> 00:14:05,759
show Sam's Museum I could totally see it

319
00:14:02,129 --> 00:14:07,439
yeah I mean really if you could if you

320
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:09,090
could afford it you'd get that little

321
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,130
you know your little puppet there

322
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:13,139
actually turned into a puppet and he

323
00:14:11,129 --> 00:14:14,970
could do the whole show but that might

324
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:15,509
be too much investment of time and

325
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:22,800
energy

326
00:14:15,509 --> 00:14:24,480
I can't believe on his way on his patch

327
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:27,179

00:16:51,058 --> 00:16:55,409
with you know you're gathering

370
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:59,789
signatures so and and I say crazy I'm

371
00:16:55,409 --> 00:17:03,389
Barry I know who you are you should ask

372
00:16:59,789 --> 00:17:04,918
for the vial in his pocket yeah I was we

373
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:06,630
were way too bit again we were gathering

374
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:08,130
signatures that's when we're working out

375
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:09,899
in the lot we did that but when we're

376
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:12,569
inside we were serious about what we

377
00:17:09,898 --> 00:17:15,078
were doing and you know we had serious

378
00:17:12,568 --> 00:17:15,078
business

379
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:28,420
oh yeah yeah we ended up with a whole

380
00:17:25,029 --> 00:17:30,730
big big jar of that here in Vancouver

381
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:33,490
for a lot I bet either still a few left

382
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:36,430
like that and that was like 25 plus

383
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:39,339
years ago it was just this big old

384
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:41,769
bottle of orange sunshine and it was it

385
00:17:39,339 --> 00:17:44,079
was you know from that was that the

386
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:46,029
granulated was that the granulated well

387
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:49,000
the look kind of like looked like little

388
00:17:46,029 --> 00:17:52,720
was a tiny little tab a tiny tiny tiny

389
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:55,000
little micro dot well they used to have

390
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,579
a friend of mine back when I originally

391
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,000
started with kin back in 93 was this cat

392
00:17:57,579 --> 00:18:03,399
in Berkeley and he moved into a

393
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:07,450
abandoned house that house turned out to

394
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:10,300
be the old printing house for all the

395
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:13,240
old posters and they left all the old

396
00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:16,750
plates and he started trading the

397
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:19,509
original last-gasp plates and all that

398
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:21,970
for actual art and one of the things he

399
00:18:19,509 --> 00:18:26,049
got at one time was a time capsule of

400
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:28,420
orange sunshine and Purple Haze and we

401
00:18:26,049 --> 00:18:29,980
actually got to do that and try the real

402
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:31,810
stuff which was actually it was

403
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:35,799
granulated you could crush it in between

404
00:18:31,809 --> 00:18:38,799
quarters and snort it and it would onset

405
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:41,440
within 15 minutes and it was probably

406
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:47,319
the most amazing LSD I've ever had in my

407
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:51,539
life hands down people made that the

408
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:55,419
first time I had any Osley acid was

409
00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:59,409
purple Asli but they were sweet little

410
00:18:55,420 --> 00:19:03,640
flatter tabs and it was in the mid

411
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:05,440
sixties that's what these were they were

412
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:07,450
yeah they he bought that it was probably

413
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,400
a time capsule from back then that was

414
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:13,120
saved and he traded it for original dead

415
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:18,540
art yeah and the sunshine was put out by

416
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:22,000
the brotherhood sands group and that was

417
00:19:18,539 --> 00:19:25,299
yeah I I still remember being at

418
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:29,200
Altamont this the free stones concert

419
00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:33,159
and some guys were standing on top of a

420
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:34,269
big School Bus well psychedelic school

421
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:38,558
bus and

422
00:19:34,269 --> 00:19:39,910
they had a huge brown paper bag like

423
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:42,819
from a grocery store

424
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:45,460
completely filled to the top with orange

425
00:19:42,819 --> 00:19:48,220
Sunshine's and they were reaching in and

426
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:51,850
the guy's arms were completely coated

427
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:54,190
with orange to the audience handful

428
00:19:51,849 --> 00:19:58,359
after handful after handful after

429
00:19:54,190 --> 00:20:00,910
handful the day the day the day the

430
00:19:58,359 --> 00:20:02,678
Summer of Love died no Altamont damn

431
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:04,570
that was heavy vibes did you feel the

432
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:05,050
heavy vibes Sam or were you just trippin

433
00:20:04,569 --> 00:20:08,619
balls

434
00:20:05,049 --> 00:20:11,950
I was so tripped out I didn't know that

435
00:20:08,619 --> 00:20:14,349
anything was bad happening until after

436
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:19,509
we got home and people started telling

437
00:20:14,349 --> 00:20:21,879
me holy [ __ ] I was so high I didn't know

438
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:24,429
it was a bummer until somebody told me

439
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:26,350
you could tell how much of a bummer it

440
00:20:24,429 --> 00:20:28,870
was by just listening to the interview

441
00:20:26,349 --> 00:20:32,649
with Jerry Garcia right before like you

442
00:20:28,869 --> 00:20:35,529
could be like well I I noticed that the

443
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:37,690
music kept stopping the stones are

444
00:20:35,529 --> 00:20:40,450
playing and they kept stopping and I

445
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:44,410
would hear me say things like now stop

446
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:49,330
that stop that or whatever I guess that

447
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:52,540
was when the angels were murdering the

448
00:20:49,329 --> 00:20:54,490
black guy yeah I think they put like a

449
00:20:52,539 --> 00:20:56,049
they had some type of a hit on Mick

450
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:57,400
Jagger for a little wild anything

451
00:20:56,049 --> 00:20:58,200
weren't they kind of upset with him

452
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:03,150
about that

453
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:06,370
yeah him and Keith Wow

454
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:08,230
well I'm I can't you know what Sam it's

455
00:21:06,369 --> 00:21:10,178
just kind of blows my mind that you were

456
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:12,339
just everywhere like I just like of

457
00:21:10,179 --> 00:21:16,059
course we're at Altamont of course I

458
00:21:12,339 --> 00:21:18,939
still AM everywhere oh my goodness it's

459
00:21:16,058 --> 00:21:23,769
true isn't that the truth you're here

460
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:26,529
right now on hash Church that is quite a

461
00:21:23,769 --> 00:21:28,808
story you know we got we got lucky too

462
00:21:26,529 --> 00:21:30,250
up here because Nick obviously I don't

463
00:21:28,808 --> 00:21:32,379
know if he got in trouble down in the

464
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:34,929
state sands but he did end up here in

465
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:36,550
Vancouver he did he did end up getting

466
00:21:34,929 --> 00:21:38,320
in trouble up here him and his partner

467
00:21:36,549 --> 00:21:41,589
Peter built a very big lab that was

468
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:44,529
producing DMT of MDMA and LSD crystal

469
00:21:41,589 --> 00:21:47,099
and the whole nine yards it was it was

470
00:21:44,529 --> 00:21:49,288
pretty crazy in the 90s the lab that was

471
00:21:47,099 --> 00:21:52,889
produced in Vancouver it was it made our

472
00:21:49,288 --> 00:21:56,308
city extremely psychedelic and I will

473
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:59,250
say that it's chick it changed

474
00:21:56,308 --> 00:22:03,149
drastically when that lab got closed it

475
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:06,269
it took a few years but that whole you

476
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:08,730
know that lab was the production of

477
00:22:06,269 --> 00:22:11,009
psychedelics for Canada and it was the

478
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:12,779
epicenter of Vancouver and it was

479
00:22:11,009 --> 00:22:16,288
incredible I mean you could just buy

480
00:22:12,779 --> 00:22:17,788
grams of crystal LSD for like you know

481
00:22:16,288 --> 00:22:19,769
eight eight thousand bucks or whatever

482
00:22:17,788 --> 00:22:21,569
and get yourself like I don't know

483
00:22:19,769 --> 00:22:24,720
whatever I think it was ten thousand or

484
00:22:21,569 --> 00:22:27,538
hits or something but um pretty crazy

485
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:30,870
that those guys just did that and I I

486
00:22:27,538 --> 00:22:32,788
thank them for it because it was a lot

487
00:22:30,869 --> 00:22:34,319
less alcohol people were consuming and

488
00:22:32,788 --> 00:22:36,450
it was a very different frequency and

489
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:39,029
vibration that people were experiencing

490
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:41,308
thanks to the to the psychedelics that

491
00:22:39,029 --> 00:22:43,168
that lab produced and they meant

492
00:22:41,308 --> 00:22:46,048
business those guys they took [ __ ]

493
00:22:43,169 --> 00:22:50,850
seriously they did not put out bad drugs

494
00:22:46,048 --> 00:22:53,690
if it was LSD it was LSD if it was MDMA

495
00:22:50,849 --> 00:22:56,250
it was actually MDMA I remember because

496
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:58,919
MDMA when they made it was a four hour

497
00:22:56,250 --> 00:23:00,679
experience and when that lab closed and

498
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:03,090
people started doing it with other

499
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:05,519
molecules that were more accessible with

500
00:23:03,089 --> 00:23:08,428
easier precursors or whatever it was it

501
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:11,158
was like ten hours long and people were

502
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:15,690
you know like just on it was bad drugs

503
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:18,480
it was just not the same thing as as

504
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:21,960
what those guys were doing so props not

505
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:24,210
not the same as good drugs as what well

506
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:26,669
I mean just accurate drugs I guess good

507
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:28,919
drugs from a chem extreme a chemist

508
00:23:26,669 --> 00:23:36,409
standpoint is purity and accuracy like

509
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:39,030
is this the molecule he put a little

510
00:23:36,409 --> 00:23:43,760
methamphetamine speed in with them to

511
00:23:39,029 --> 00:23:47,129
pick you up oh yeah well I was

512
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:48,929
absolutely true so I'm sure orange

513
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:52,190
sunshine barrels had a little bit of

514
00:23:48,929 --> 00:23:57,450
speed in them no they didn't know true

515
00:23:52,190 --> 00:24:00,140
which ones not it they were Asli acid

516
00:23:57,450 --> 00:24:04,670
not the sunshine banded brother

517
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:08,450
it was obviously acid because he somehow

518
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:12,590
for some reason thought that it made it

519
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:16,308
better you know he was one of the people

520
00:24:12,589 --> 00:24:19,069
kind of like you Sam you and Osley are

521
00:24:16,308 --> 00:24:19,849
the two similarities when I started

522
00:24:19,069 --> 00:24:24,019
bubble bags

523
00:24:19,849 --> 00:24:26,990
I had to somewhat abrasive characters

524
00:24:24,019 --> 00:24:29,210
contact me via email at first I was just

525
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:32,539
like I knew who you were right away

526
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:34,940
because you were like you wrote me like

527
00:24:32,539 --> 00:24:36,589
this short email that was like if it

528
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:38,419
don't bubble a date with the trouble do

529
00:24:36,589 --> 00:24:40,730
you know whose first said that something

530
00:24:38,419 --> 00:24:43,160
like that and I was just like this is

531
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:44,900
the night I can't remember what your

532
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:47,630
email was at the time it might have even

533
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:50,210
been snow wasn't skunk man some other I

534
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:52,730
was like is this [ __ ] so is this who

535
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:54,500
I think it is and and owlsley was

536
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:56,360
another character who hit me up he was

537
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:58,579
like yeah bubble bags hey like I like

538
00:24:56,359 --> 00:25:00,529
butter better I like putting my resin

539
00:24:58,579 --> 00:25:02,960
into butter and then he's like I started

540
00:25:00,529 --> 00:25:05,058
a dialogue with him over bubble bags I

541
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,039
ended up sending him a set when he was

542
00:25:05,058 --> 00:25:09,859
living I guess in Australia is that

543
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:12,259
where he finished his life is that some

544
00:25:09,859 --> 00:25:14,869
right was he in Australia yeah so it's

545
00:25:12,259 --> 00:25:18,079
correct yeah so that was that was like

546
00:25:14,869 --> 00:25:19,819
the late 90s early 2000s that I sent him

547
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:21,319
some bags and he just couldn't

548
00:25:19,819 --> 00:25:25,099
acknowledge that it was he was kind of

549
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:27,109
like yeah you know it's okay but I just

550
00:25:25,099 --> 00:25:30,079
took it all and put it into butter I'm

551
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:32,209
like butter like his in fact like animal

552
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:35,869
fat you took that hash that you made and

553
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:37,490
you put it into animals I was like bro I

554
00:25:35,869 --> 00:25:39,678
wish you could have just puffed a bowl

555
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:41,720
of it before you did that to each

556
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:44,419
they're not big on the meat diet right

557
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:49,160
like he was huge on the meat diet dude

558
00:25:44,419 --> 00:25:51,080
it was like all the way have I ever told

559
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:53,720
the story about like when I met when I

560
00:25:51,079 --> 00:25:55,428
met there I don't think so okay I

561
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:59,390
thought maybe I said that I had shirts

562
00:25:55,429 --> 00:26:02,059
er yes crazy when you remember so I

563
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:05,179
defended my PhD dissertation on a

564
00:26:02,058 --> 00:26:12,349
Wednesday afternoon it was March the

565
00:26:05,179 --> 00:26:14,269
18th 1992 and March the 20th

566
00:26:12,349 --> 00:26:17,119
a day and a half later we were in

567
00:26:14,269 --> 00:26:20,210
Hamilton Ontario at the Grateful Dead

568
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:22,308
show and so a friend of mine was

569
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:25,548
actually having an affair with bear at

570
00:26:22,308 --> 00:26:28,160
the time and she came up to me during

571
00:26:25,548 --> 00:26:31,179
darkstar so I remember correctly

572
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:34,548
Darkstar it went into space and and

573
00:26:31,179 --> 00:26:37,038
Starck star I was really high was just

574
00:26:34,548 --> 00:26:39,500
really not in the mood to interact with

575
00:26:37,038 --> 00:26:41,450
anybody and she said come with me you're

576
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:42,788
gonna we're gonna go meet bear and I'm

577
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:45,440
like oh okay

578
00:26:42,788 --> 00:26:47,690
you know so I was led through a crowd of

579
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:50,570
people and she had a laminate so she was

580
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:53,179
able to get me back backstage and I was

581
00:26:50,569 --> 00:26:55,700
literally on the side of the arena and

582
00:26:53,179 --> 00:26:57,860
the band walk right in front of me like

583
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:59,538
Jerry was like right there like right in

584
00:26:57,859 --> 00:27:01,428
front of me like as close as I am to my

585
00:26:59,538 --> 00:27:03,109
computer you know I'm just like

586
00:27:01,429 --> 00:27:06,230
starstruck I didn't know what to say and

587
00:27:03,109 --> 00:27:09,319
bear was over in the side stage and he

588
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:11,690
had his belt buckle thing and a

589
00:27:09,319 --> 00:27:13,700
flashlight and he was shining his

590
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:17,929
flashlight on belt buckles trying to

591
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:19,519
talk somebody into buying it and so

592
00:27:17,929 --> 00:27:22,190
eventually I went over there and was

593
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:24,500
sort of his next person to talk to and

594
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:26,360
so this was during the drums portion now

595
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:29,869
because the drummers were just on stage

596
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:31,969
and the first thing he said when I

597
00:27:29,869 --> 00:27:34,250
walked up to him is he grabbed me in the

598
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:38,210
gut and he said you need to go to the

599
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:41,900
gym pal he grabbed my beer belly and

600
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:44,929
pinched my gut and then my friend Sharon

601
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:47,269
introduced us and said this is my friend

602
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:50,570
mark he just got his PhD in chemistry

603
00:27:47,269 --> 00:27:52,759
you should talk with there and so it was

604
00:27:50,569 --> 00:27:55,189
cool because my first discussion of

605
00:27:52,759 --> 00:27:58,759
chemistry outside of my PhD dissertation

606
00:27:55,190 --> 00:28:00,769
defense because I slept the entire next

607
00:27:58,759 --> 00:28:03,319
day Thursday then Friday we drove the

608
00:28:00,769 --> 00:28:05,960
Hamilton was with Barre backstage at a

609
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:08,450
Grateful Dead show and we talked from

610
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:11,329
the drums portion through the end of the

611
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:13,279
show through everybody leaving the arena

612
00:28:11,329 --> 00:28:15,558
I think we were the last two people in

613
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:17,899
the arena and just still talking about

614
00:28:15,558 --> 00:28:19,879
chemistry and acid and just talking

615
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:22,909
about all kinds of things and he was

616
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:24,700
just an amazing dude and just yeah I had

617
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:26,860
basically about

618
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:31,059
two or three our conversation with him

619
00:28:26,859 --> 00:28:32,859
at a Grateful Dead backstage and we were

620
00:28:31,059 --> 00:28:35,169
the only two people in the building by

621
00:28:32,859 --> 00:28:36,879
the end of the conversation and it's

622
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:39,130
crazy it was just it was just such a

623
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:41,440
wild conversation I if I could only had

624
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:42,700
a recorder and record like what we

625
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,070
talked about what we talked about

626
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:46,690
everything having to do with chemistry

627
00:28:45,069 --> 00:28:48,819
about having to do with psychedelics

628
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:53,529
about having to do with extraction

629
00:28:48,819 --> 00:28:55,149
chemical modification the early days he

630
00:28:53,529 --> 00:28:57,430
would reference to other people I think

631
00:28:55,150 --> 00:29:00,280
he may be talked about Nick I'm not sure

632
00:28:57,430 --> 00:29:03,220
exactly it's I have to put thing and

633
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:11,559
again I was super super hot it's a time

634
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:13,930
so said that once before in hash Church

635
00:29:11,559 --> 00:29:16,529
but yeah that's like I noticed might

636
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:21,240
create my first interaction with

637
00:29:16,529 --> 00:29:24,549
chemistry as a PhD this was bigger

638
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:27,819
couldn't be any better come on that's

639
00:29:24,549 --> 00:29:30,369
beyond epic dawg is that so cool is like

640
00:29:27,819 --> 00:29:32,500
total circle because again I was just a

641
00:29:30,369 --> 00:29:35,500
spun out kid on Grateful Dead tour in

642
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:39,160
the 80s you know like most kids just you

643
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:41,349
know wow this band is like it again I

644
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:43,150
had said this before on has Church you

645
00:29:41,349 --> 00:29:45,189
can go to like a new young show or an

646
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:48,009
Allman Brothers show and you get hassled

647
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:51,940
if you had a one-hitter at a dead show

648
00:29:48,009 --> 00:29:54,400
you could just blatantly just blaze out

649
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:57,309
in the open and it was just it was so

650
00:29:54,400 --> 00:30:01,630
cool because again like if my friend G

651
00:29:57,309 --> 00:30:03,250
chem dog who tells a story for most of

652
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:05,970
us who lived in the Northeast United

653
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:09,309
States we really didn't have access to

654
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:12,160
really kind bud like he'd go into

655
00:30:09,309 --> 00:30:14,740
Manhattan and you get this little manila

656
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:17,590
envelope full of mostly seeds and stems

657
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:19,299
and it was like 40 bucks you know from

658
00:30:17,589 --> 00:30:21,939
the same guy you get eight ball coke

659
00:30:19,299 --> 00:30:24,609
from you know but you know that's like

660
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:28,240
the extent of of weed in Manhattan in

661
00:30:24,609 --> 00:30:30,879
like the you know mid to late 80s so

662
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:33,549
when the dead came to town they just

663
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:38,100
brought great genetics from NorCal and

664
00:30:33,549 --> 00:30:41,529
just tons of just great weed and so so

665
00:30:38,099 --> 00:30:44,859
it was kind of like the cannabis smell

666
00:30:41,529 --> 00:30:47,740
was the Grateful Dead show smelled to me

667
00:30:44,859 --> 00:30:50,199
you know to me like it just it became

668
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:52,720
like it was so just conditioned to me

669
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:55,390
like really good weed oh yeah that

670
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:59,259
smells like a dead show like skunky weed

671
00:30:55,390 --> 00:31:02,320
and we that smells like dog poo right

672
00:30:59,259 --> 00:31:04,230
right hey Kevin how you doing what are

673
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:08,769
you doing

674
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:10,839
I begin you're out of purgatory well you

675
00:31:08,769 --> 00:31:12,639
know what here's the thing we actually

676
00:31:10,839 --> 00:31:15,399
aren't live right now we're recording

677
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:18,130
the show but I couldn't get zoom to work

678
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:24,190
because I'm guessing the entire world is

679
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:25,840
doing zoom doodles right those were

680
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:28,660
great Grateful Dead stories man I'll

681
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:31,149
tell you you definitely if you want to

682
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:34,840
see the most cannabis smoke you've ever

683
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:36,670
seen at a concert for me it was and I

684
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:40,209
was there with skunk man Sam and his

685
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:42,880
wife it was in Negril Jamaica at one of

686
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:45,850
Bob Marley's birthday bash concerts and

687
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:49,120
it was I have video footage of it the

688
00:31:45,849 --> 00:31:49,859
audience legitimately looks like they're

689
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:53,619
on fire

690
00:31:49,859 --> 00:31:55,359
there's just billows of smoke coming you

691
00:31:53,619 --> 00:31:57,129
keep in mind to like when people smoke

692
00:31:55,359 --> 00:31:59,679
in Jamaica they don't pass joints

693
00:31:57,130 --> 00:32:00,850
everyone has their own joint so we're

694
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:03,039
you might have three or four people

695
00:32:00,849 --> 00:32:06,429
together at a fish or a Dead concert

696
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:08,980
sharing a joint at a at a at a reggae

697
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:10,779
concert in Jamaica the joint is four

698
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:14,140
times bigger and nobody's sharing

699
00:32:10,779 --> 00:32:18,490
anything it's just your own joint it was

700
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:23,259
you remember that Sam absolutely it was

701
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:27,490
impressive hey enjoy Jamaica concert

702
00:32:23,259 --> 00:32:31,329
yard concerts mom yeah yard concerts

703
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:32,529
exactly just good vibes I know a lot of

704
00:32:31,329 --> 00:32:34,929
musicians have been playing free

705
00:32:32,529 --> 00:32:36,250
concerts lately including Neil Young if

706
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:39,100
you're not a part of it you can go to

707
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:40,990
Neil Young archives com cost about 20

708
00:32:39,099 --> 00:32:42,939
bucks I got on there for the presale

709
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:44,529
tickets that he gives you when he does a

710
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:46,660
concert he'll let you buy them like a

711
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:48,879
about a week before and you get some

712
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:51,529
really great seats but also all of

713
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:53,960
Neil's entire catalog of music

714
00:32:51,529 --> 00:32:56,660
is on Neil Young archives calm and it's

715
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:59,269
all of the highest caliber quality music

716
00:32:56,660 --> 00:33:01,250
it's not some funk [ __ ] mp3s Neil's

717
00:32:59,269 --> 00:33:03,200
obsessed with quality and with with

718
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:05,960
proper music but him and his wife have

719
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:08,750
been doing these fireside concert series

720
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:10,490
and he started it out in his like the

721
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:12,799
backyard of his ranch with his guitar

722
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:14,930
and his harmonica then he ends up inside

723
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:17,089
sitting next to the fireplace and he

724
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:20,420
does you know some harmonica some guitar

725
00:33:17,089 --> 00:33:23,839
some piano just short concerts 20 to 30

726
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:26,210
minutes long but absolutely incredible

727
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:28,669
and very unique to be able to see that

728
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:30,650
with Neil Clinton Fearon the bassist

729
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:33,350
from the gladiators who's been doing his

730
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:35,470
own music for 25 plus years he did one

731
00:33:33,349 --> 00:33:37,789
the other day that I posted as well and

732
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:39,500
I'm sure there's a lot more that you

733
00:33:37,789 --> 00:33:41,480
guys probably know of as well but have

734
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:45,019
been doing these live concerts during

735
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:46,700
art self-isolation time I think ray

736
00:33:45,019 --> 00:33:49,460
anastasiya has been doing some corn

737
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:51,680
tunes as well I've seen them not live

738
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:53,840
but I've definitely seen a lot of them

739
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:56,390
in his living room that's great at least

740
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:59,179
like two songs yeah just playing

741
00:33:56,390 --> 00:34:01,670
treatment Mike Mike's been doing some

742
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:03,620
bass lessons and some Theory lessons on

743
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:06,800
his channel as well so if any you guys

744
00:34:03,619 --> 00:34:10,460
are our fans of his bass playing you can

745
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:13,429
check that that out and hey learning the

746
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:15,590
covert virus in cannabis I shared this

747
00:34:13,429 --> 00:34:17,559
link with Sam and with Marcus

748
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:19,820
unnourished I'm gonna put it in the chat

749
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:21,590
obviously not now but when you guys get

750
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:25,220
a chance check out this YouTube video

751
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:31,159
from this guy over Ebru University who

752
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:33,678
talks about the recovery phase from

753
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:37,700
kovat and out cannabis indica

754
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:43,550
quote-unquote can be useful I know let's

755
00:34:37,699 --> 00:34:45,168
talk about that mark yeah I mean I again

756
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:47,450
I I was actually in the middle of

757
00:34:45,168 --> 00:34:49,759
watching this when the episode started

758
00:34:47,449 --> 00:34:52,189
so I want to give this guy a full listen

759
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:55,310
to before I completely discount what

760
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:57,950
he's saying but do you know the state at

761
00:34:55,309 --> 00:34:59,449
all Kevin I don't I haven't seen the

762
00:34:57,949 --> 00:35:01,099
paper yet but I have been digging

763
00:34:59,449 --> 00:35:03,589
through their literature and it's the

764
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:04,880
the lung fibrosis seems to be very

765
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:07,309
interesting

766
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:10,579
where it maybe reducing lung fibrosis

767
00:35:07,309 --> 00:35:11,960
maybe in recovery I don't know the vibe

768
00:35:10,579 --> 00:35:13,610
the viral load stuffs kind of all over

769
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:15,470
the map there's some positive results

770
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:17,690
although they're in very small studies

771
00:35:15,469 --> 00:35:20,480
with HCV but it doesn't work with HPV

772
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:23,090
and then I think someone published a

773
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:26,900
paper showing that in THC and mice it

774
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:29,720
can make it worse so yeah it's kind of

775
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:32,269
uh it's murky it's murky information but

776
00:35:29,719 --> 00:35:33,709
I don't know that there's reason to

777
00:35:32,269 --> 00:35:35,780
suggest people get off their

778
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:38,389
cannabinoids right now it seems to be a

779
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:39,920
little bit premature and could be risky

780
00:35:38,389 --> 00:35:42,739
depending on people's condition yeah

781
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:45,460
absolutely because in general doesn't it

782
00:35:42,739 --> 00:35:48,500
just sort of boost your your you know

783
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:52,099
your immune system in general because of

784
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:54,130
its cb2 activity and just sort of act as

785
00:35:52,099 --> 00:35:56,089
sort of like a peripheral

786
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:59,480
anti-inflammatory agent that would help

787
00:35:56,090 --> 00:36:01,400
with fever or any other symptoms that

788
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:04,670
could come along with getting anybody

789
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:06,710
nice I'm not a physician I've been told

790
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:08,869
to say that a lot when it comes to this

791
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:10,490
stuff but what I've read is it's an

792
00:36:08,869 --> 00:36:12,409
immune modulator so if your immune

793
00:36:10,489 --> 00:36:14,269
systems down it brings it up if it's

794
00:36:12,409 --> 00:36:16,730
cytokine in the vacants in a cytokine

795
00:36:14,269 --> 00:36:18,139
storm brings it down that's probably the

796
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:19,849
most important feature because the

797
00:36:18,139 --> 00:36:22,219
cytokine storms were killing people with

798
00:36:19,849 --> 00:36:24,319
Kove it you know the viral loads are

799
00:36:22,219 --> 00:36:26,750
going down and the storms are going up

800
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:31,519
which is a sign that your immune systems

801
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:33,409
already dealing with that but the

802
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:37,130
dragonfly risk medicine family and

803
00:36:33,409 --> 00:36:41,139
bubbleman hosted a webinar a couple of

804
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:43,730
days ago with a few doctors on board

805
00:36:41,139 --> 00:36:46,429
talking about this very issue it's very

806
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:49,309
informative and very upbeat there's a

807
00:36:46,429 --> 00:36:51,109
couple of out there moments but it's

808
00:36:49,309 --> 00:36:53,449
worth checking out I don't know the link

809
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:55,700
on it I don't know if Josh and Kelly are

810
00:36:53,449 --> 00:36:57,949
still on but it's bubbleman you would

811
00:36:55,699 --> 00:37:00,409
know how to steer people towards that

812
00:36:57,949 --> 00:37:02,329
show yeah I put it on about this that

813
00:37:00,409 --> 00:37:04,519
was all dragonfly earth medicine all I

814
00:37:02,329 --> 00:37:06,230
did was host and listen so the props

815
00:37:04,519 --> 00:37:08,239
goes to them and all the people they

816
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:10,519
organized and brought on that was

817
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:14,000
amazing I really liked it I thought

818
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:17,389
Ethan's presentation was really solid

819
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,900
I liked Terry a lot he was just like I

820
00:37:17,389 --> 00:37:19,279
was just

821
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:21,500
like am I gonna go hang out with this

822
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:25,160
guy when this when the self-isolation

823
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:27,019
things over cuz he just was like he's

824
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:30,980
wrong yeah he's just the mushroom man I

825
00:37:27,019 --> 00:37:34,539
love I love that guy actually believes

826
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:34,539
what you started self-oscillation

827
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:41,510
you know Todd's got his that's the one

828
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:43,510
minute to mention about you know the

829
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:46,430
thing about cannabis is that it brings

830
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:56,930
balance and stasis because it's an

831
00:37:46,429 --> 00:38:01,519
adaptogen yes this is true eating it or

832
00:37:56,929 --> 00:38:03,710
smoking so okay yeah I mean especially

833
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:05,840
if you have it in your chest they're

834
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:08,320
telling you not to smoke at all that it

835
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:11,840
all should be ingested if your

836
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:14,120
respiratory distress smoking cannabis is

837
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:16,010
not what you want to be doing you don't

838
00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:18,589
I don't even know if vaping it is safe

839
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:20,420
but you know your lungs are trying to

840
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:23,750
recover and your lungs you're trying I

841
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:26,480
don't think that it's it's more just to

842
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:29,030
give your lungs a break from all the you

843
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:34,210
know stress that just smoking puts on it

844
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:37,940
what about dads like 450 you know I

845
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:39,559
don't think the research is is out there

846
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:42,980
I mean maybe we should do the research

847
00:38:39,559 --> 00:38:45,739
I'll be the subject I'm set up right now

848
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:52,519
at 450 degrees okay well first get

849
00:38:45,739 --> 00:38:54,469
infected with the virus and well I mean

850
00:38:52,519 --> 00:38:57,019
again a double-blind study you would

851
00:38:54,469 --> 00:39:00,139
have to actually have patients with

852
00:38:57,019 --> 00:39:03,050
viral load I mean it's just I don't even

853
00:39:00,139 --> 00:39:06,650
know how you but the mechanism for

854
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:10,610
putting health workers in harm's way and

855
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:13,130
how that whole thing plays out you know

856
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:18,430
I think it's long as you give my dad

857
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:18,430
first they'll go with it yeah well we're

858
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:28,940
well that was weird

859
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:31,580
Oh a little bit 18 what'd you say I said

860
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:33,980
we're just following CDC guidelines and

861
00:39:31,579 --> 00:39:36,650
proper six foot spacing we've also got

862
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:39,050
authorization to do curbside delivery so

863
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:42,170
things that we're limiting as best as we

864
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:44,570
can patients access yeah I mean check

865
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:46,550
out this for irony so Pennsylvania as

866
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:48,650
you know has state-run liquor stores

867
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:51,260
well those are all closed but they

868
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:52,280
deemed cannabis as being medically

869
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:54,920
necessary

870
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:57,110
so the cannabis stores in Pennsylvania

871
00:39:54,920 --> 00:40:00,289
are open but the liquor stores are

872
00:39:57,110 --> 00:40:12,680
closed we're living in the upside-down

873
00:40:00,289 --> 00:40:15,199
times for sure no go ahead Tim okay I

874
00:40:12,679 --> 00:40:20,179
just wanted to mention that the highest

875
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:25,669
I ever got on acid was not oddly acid it

876
00:40:20,179 --> 00:40:28,219
was a nix acid orange sunshine and I ate

877
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:31,280
between fifty and a hundred of them I

878
00:40:28,219 --> 00:40:33,139
didn't know my friend ed dosed his bond

879
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:37,970
Oh of orange juice with a hundred hits

880
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:39,469
and I was so thirsty they walked up to

881
00:40:37,969 --> 00:40:43,159
right if I could add some orange juice

882
00:40:39,469 --> 00:40:45,679
because yeah and he's soaked like the

883
00:40:43,159 --> 00:40:48,529
kind then he watch me with really big

884
00:40:45,679 --> 00:41:05,949
eyes is a great half the bottle or more

885
00:40:48,530 --> 00:41:14,030
oh my god Sam that's dr. Seuss character

886
00:41:05,949 --> 00:41:16,849
my wife was there so she did her VW Bug

887
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:19,460
and we went back to more candy that I

888
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:22,789
was able to sleep that right because

889
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:25,130
when I discovered with acid is once you

890
00:41:22,789 --> 00:41:28,730
take more than 500 or a thousand bikes

891
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:31,490
you don't you might have a slightly

892
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:35,889
stronger experience but it doesn't

893
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:35,889
really last longer or you know it's

894
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:44,180
okay four months as opposed to five

895
00:41:42,469 --> 00:41:46,639
minutes pretty safe stuff I'm like I

896
00:41:44,179 --> 00:41:49,460
know guys the dead very small amounts

897
00:41:46,639 --> 00:41:50,599
and just never came back the same they

898
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:52,429
just had it they just went to a

899
00:41:50,599 --> 00:41:54,980
different place Syd Barrett

900
00:41:52,429 --> 00:41:56,449
cough cough Syd Barrett yeah I mean I

901
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:58,820
didn't know him personally but that's

902
00:41:56,449 --> 00:42:00,739
definitely a good example but I don't we

903
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:02,690
all have our own Syd Barrett's like I

904
00:42:00,739 --> 00:42:07,219
remember we had our own Syd Barrett we

905
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:11,780
called him microwave well I never really

906
00:42:07,219 --> 00:42:16,069
had bad trips and I I took the acid more

907
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:21,619
than 500 times blue has taken a trip

908
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:23,210
during quarantine already no thanks I

909
00:42:21,619 --> 00:42:27,950
yeah

910
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:31,220
I know my psyche and all that and yet

911
00:42:27,949 --> 00:42:50,659
not the time probably yeah no not time I

912
00:42:31,219 --> 00:42:53,389
stress about it it's not a very high

913
00:42:50,659 --> 00:42:55,429
dose if you don't feel like sharing if

914
00:42:53,389 --> 00:42:57,230
it's not very intense and you don't

915
00:42:55,429 --> 00:42:59,569
think about coronavirus that much and

916
00:42:57,230 --> 00:43:01,940
that word is ending I'm kidding but yeah

917
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:04,880
it is a nice it is it is a nice thing

918
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:08,210

Alison walk sauce thank you guys thanks

920
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:14,510
for showing up how how was Spain

921
00:43:11,230 --> 00:43:17,329
congratulations on a near win there I'm

922
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:19,130
you're snacking thank you guys

923
00:43:17,329 --> 00:43:20,840
actually it was kind of crazy we're

924
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:23,869
quarantined together now since we came

925
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:26,000
back from Spain I'm not an American

926
00:43:23,869 --> 00:43:27,350
citizen so it was pretty stressful the

927
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,780
returned I really thought I wasn't

928
00:43:27,349 --> 00:43:32,480
coming back I actually entered United

929
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:35,390
States one hour before they closed the

930
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:36,800
doors for like any outsider you know any

931
00:43:35,389 --> 00:43:39,049
any person that it's not an American

932
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:41,780
citizen so it was very stressful

933
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:44,119
experience but we're here safe in his

934
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:46,070
house there's a huge garden I'm

935
00:43:44,119 --> 00:43:47,690
inspiring I'm getting a lot inspired and

936
00:43:46,070 --> 00:43:50,539
attempt your family right now so I'm

937
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:52,380
using this quarantine time to plan a

938
00:43:50,539 --> 00:43:54,210
garden and to prep the garden

939
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:55,890
chase what I think everyone should do so

940
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:58,230
everyone that has a garden should do

941
00:43:55,889 --> 00:44:00,808
that so now it's this time all of my

942
00:43:58,230 --> 00:44:03,599
free time will be towards that and Spain

943
00:44:00,809 --> 00:44:06,690
didn't happen much Genovese was canceled

944
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:07,588
some cups happen happily the ego clash

945
00:44:06,690 --> 00:44:10,380
had happened

946
00:44:07,588 --> 00:44:12,568
this guy here got first first first in

947
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:15,900
water hash the theory I got sick and it

948
00:44:12,568 --> 00:44:17,880
was very nice everyone congrats course

949
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:19,230
take it home with the bubble bags or

950
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:27,298
maybe not I don't know I don't want to

951
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:33,329
overstep my boundaries use according to

952
00:44:27,298 --> 00:44:36,480
watch to look at resin he was nice but

953
00:44:33,329 --> 00:44:38,190
what's short cut short yeah yeah I was

954
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:41,338
surprised how many people went I was

955
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:45,778
supposed to go to Italy on the 24th to

956
00:44:41,338 --> 00:44:48,869
see this different form of extraction I

957
00:44:45,778 --> 00:44:50,429
was going to do a tour and then I was

958
00:44:48,869 --> 00:44:52,588
kind of like oh geez I don't know like

959
00:44:50,429 --> 00:44:54,149
it sounds like Italy is not doing too

960
00:44:52,588 --> 00:44:55,679
well with this like maybe they're gonna

961
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:57,028
quarantine people I don't want to get

962
00:44:55,679 --> 00:45:00,719
caught up in a quarantine and that was

963
00:44:57,028 --> 00:45:02,400
like weeks before Barcelona like at

964
00:45:00,719 --> 00:45:03,480
least two and a half weeks or something

965
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:07,470
and then people were all like oh I'm

966
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:09,269
going to Barcelona I'm like what like I

967
00:45:07,469 --> 00:45:11,459
just kind of saw the writing on the wall

968
00:45:09,268 --> 00:45:12,959
I was so surprised at how many of my

969
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:15,599
friends were like yeah yeah I'm going I

970
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:16,400
was just like wow alright let me know

971
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:19,440
how it goes

972
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:21,210
because spannabis I think this been

973
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:23,490
abyss as an event was very irresponsible

974
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:25,679
and they're still being very responsible

975
00:45:23,489 --> 00:45:28,199
because they posted something online

976
00:45:25,679 --> 00:45:32,460
that they were not going to cancel the

977
00:45:28,199 --> 00:45:34,078
event like 500 right and then and then

978
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:36,420
the government made them shut down there

979
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:38,190
not maybe event not happen and now have

980
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:39,778
a new date guys we don't know what the

981
00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:41,880
[ __ ] going on the work and now they

982
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:44,219
have a new date on September well what I

983
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:48,240
heard was that they did not have

984
00:45:44,219 --> 00:45:51,268
insurance to cover like you know

985
00:45:48,239 --> 00:45:54,659
cancelling it because of some virus but

986
00:45:51,268 --> 00:45:58,318
if the city cancelled it then they might

987
00:45:54,659 --> 00:46:01,199
be insured so they had to wait for the

988
00:45:58,318 --> 00:46:03,690
city to cancel the event and the city

989
00:46:01,199 --> 00:46:05,559
cancelled the event like on an hour

990
00:46:03,690 --> 00:46:09,539
after everyone showed up to

991
00:46:05,559 --> 00:46:12,340
now everyone showed up everyone everyone

992
00:46:09,539 --> 00:46:15,039
everyone dropped the gardener before

993
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:16,750
like one week before sometimes you know

994
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:18,130
like so it's it's a it's very

995
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:20,469
responsible especially when you're

996
00:46:18,130 --> 00:46:22,599
dealing with people that I mean work

997
00:46:20,469 --> 00:46:25,889
with cannabis I feel like it well I

998
00:46:22,599 --> 00:46:29,529
guess go ahead think about it

999
00:46:25,889 --> 00:46:33,849
spannabis and all these big smoking

1000
00:46:29,530 --> 00:46:37,090
events half the people I know get sick

1001
00:46:33,849 --> 00:46:40,869
when they go to them oh yeah no deny

1002
00:46:37,090 --> 00:46:44,860
that that's just a cold truth I was

1003
00:46:40,869 --> 00:46:48,489
thinking man if everybody goes there and

1004
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:50,710
Corona had some Jesus Christ oh it's a

1005
00:46:48,489 --> 00:46:53,439
huge vector like nobody can deny the

1006
00:46:50,710 --> 00:46:56,409
vector that is fifty thousand cannabis

1007
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:58,450
smokers getting together and it's in a

1008
00:46:56,409 --> 00:47:01,509
city where everyone that doesn't smoke

1009
00:46:58,449 --> 00:47:04,269
cannabis smokes cigarettes and just

1010
00:47:01,510 --> 00:47:05,920
smoking smoking smoking smoking I mean

1011
00:47:04,269 --> 00:47:09,190
it's the sickest I've ever gotten in my

1012
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:13,030
life has been expand abyss and it was no

1013
00:47:09,190 --> 00:47:17,289
joke I was sick for four weeks hard like

1014
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:20,470
bedridden like thought I was but my wife

1015
00:47:17,289 --> 00:47:22,929
ended up in the hospital I know and we

1016
00:47:20,469 --> 00:47:25,389
stayed at the same place so what your

1017
00:47:22,929 --> 00:47:27,489
wife got was what I got like we all were

1018
00:47:25,389 --> 00:47:31,000
under the same roof that trip

1019
00:47:27,489 --> 00:47:33,429
you me Diana and Tony it's crazy to see

1020
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:35,110
you that you got sick to Marco's because

1021
00:47:33,429 --> 00:47:36,339
I know you don't share things with other

1022
00:47:35,110 --> 00:47:38,650
people I know you don't share your

1023
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:40,240
devices you know smoke joints I feel

1024
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:41,530
like in a moment like this we always

1025
00:47:40,239 --> 00:47:43,000
have to think about all this harm

1026
00:47:41,530 --> 00:47:45,340
reduction strategies that we already

1027
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:48,639
know for like drug consumption but way

1028
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:50,769
more you know like when we were there I

1029
00:47:48,639 --> 00:47:53,920
was I was kind of paranoid with bacteria

1030
00:47:50,769 --> 00:48:02,320
and everybody expanded his chairs joints

1031
00:47:53,920 --> 00:48:04,840
and chairs pipes it shares bongs way

1032
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:05,830
viruses word viruses are completely

1033
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:08,710
different you know they're not like

1034
00:48:05,829 --> 00:48:10,779
bacteria like if you have strep you

1035
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:14,019
should be taking an antibiotic but

1036
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:17,440
actually if you have a virus taking an

1037
00:48:14,019 --> 00:48:19,989
antibiotic is actually

1038
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:22,300
not the really the best thing you can do

1039
00:48:19,989 --> 00:48:25,689
for your house and and the thing is is

1040
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:28,930
like well the way viruses viruses were

1041
00:48:25,690 --> 00:48:31,568
just like bundles of RNA and DNA that

1042
00:48:28,929 --> 00:48:34,690
get into your cell and infect yourselves

1043
00:48:31,568 --> 00:48:38,679
and so it just it works completely

1044
00:48:34,690 --> 00:48:41,619
different than then then bugs it's just

1045
00:48:38,679 --> 00:48:45,338
it's it's not like a it's not like a

1046
00:48:41,619 --> 00:48:48,550
bacteria and so and so when you were

1047
00:48:45,338 --> 00:48:52,650
saying like yeah well it's kind of like

1048
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:56,380
the kid who ate dirt as a child is

1049
00:48:52,650 --> 00:48:59,650
healthier because his immune system was

1050
00:48:56,380 --> 00:49:02,079
challenged with not like the complete

1051
00:48:59,650 --> 00:49:04,599
viruses but just like a piece of the

1052
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:09,250
virus I'm not exactly sure how the body

1053
00:49:04,599 --> 00:49:11,710
uses like its immune challenges early in

1054
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:14,469
your lifetime to develop an immune

1055
00:49:11,710 --> 00:49:16,900
response and so like some people may get

1056
00:49:14,469 --> 00:49:19,029
the corona virus and it may just be like

1057
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:21,670
influenza virus to make it a sore throat

1058
00:49:19,030 --> 00:49:24,400
it may be you know again go through

1059
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:26,349
their system in like a week or two but

1060
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:30,309
others are gonna be really susceptible

1061
00:49:26,349 --> 00:49:32,470
and I guess it hits the lungs and before

1062
00:49:30,309 --> 00:49:36,279
you find out if you don't do the testing

1063
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:38,618
you know in a reasonable period of time

1064
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:40,810
it could be too late and that's when you

1065
00:49:38,619 --> 00:49:43,990
need to respirator and that's where put

1066
00:49:40,809 --> 00:49:45,940
strain on the medical system but there

1067
00:49:43,989 --> 00:49:49,929
is no real you can't really you can

1068
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:51,519
attack viruses with a prophylactic

1069
00:49:49,929 --> 00:49:53,679
antiviral like they're talking about

1070
00:49:51,519 --> 00:49:56,980
this chloro quinine and all this other

1071
00:49:53,679 --> 00:49:59,108
stuff but they really don't have things

1072
00:49:56,980 --> 00:50:01,719
that are specific that fight these

1073
00:49:59,108 --> 00:50:04,779
viruses that's why HIV was such a

1074
00:50:01,719 --> 00:50:07,509
challenge to develop specific antiviral

1075
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:09,000
therapies to treat it I faith in our

1076
00:50:07,510 --> 00:50:13,890
immune systems it's the ultimate

1077
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:16,900
laboratory where that is done

1078
00:50:13,889 --> 00:50:18,909
pharmaceutical company right and so and

1079
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:21,430
and so on that aspect I think you know

1080
00:50:18,909 --> 00:50:24,420
Ethan hit on this the other day which is

1081
00:50:21,429 --> 00:50:28,868
I think keeping your endocannabinoids

1082
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:30,349
sister from nourished can only help

1083
00:50:28,869 --> 00:50:32,630
right because

1084
00:50:30,349 --> 00:50:34,429
you're basically you're gonna get your

1085
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:37,309
immune system as good as it could

1086
00:50:34,429 --> 00:50:39,739
possibly be to you know fight off what

1087
00:50:37,309 --> 00:50:41,539
it can't and what it can do ultimately I

1088
00:50:39,739 --> 00:50:43,129
think if you do get a virus whatever

1089
00:50:41,539 --> 00:50:45,920
virus whether it's a rhinovirus

1090
00:50:43,130 --> 00:50:48,829
it's a common cold or just some other

1091
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:51,559
you know viral infection the best thing

1092
00:50:48,829 --> 00:50:53,869
you can do is yes sleep push the fluids

1093
00:50:51,559 --> 00:50:56,570
get your kidneys working you know and

1094
00:50:53,869 --> 00:50:59,869
just you know try to you know stay away

1095
00:50:56,570 --> 00:51:01,400
from things like antibiotics the thing

1096
00:50:59,869 --> 00:51:03,920
with antibiotics if you dude you take an

1097
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:06,530
antibiotic you should be taking you know

1098
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:08,930
live yogurt cultures after that to help

1099
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:11,210
reestablish again what these guys were

1100
00:51:08,929 --> 00:51:14,089
talking about in the talk the other day

1101
00:51:11,210 --> 00:51:15,920
which is your bio yeah unfortunately you

1102
00:51:14,090 --> 00:51:17,660
know if you're taking antibiotics well

1103
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:19,849
first thing I wanted to say is that a

1104
00:51:17,659 --> 00:51:21,199
lot of the science and everything behind

1105
00:51:19,849 --> 00:51:25,809
this is all funded by pharmaceutical

1106
00:51:21,199 --> 00:51:25,809
companies so let's not forget you know

1107
00:51:26,710 --> 00:51:33,679
them up with solutions for you that help

1108
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:35,450
profit them so that really is bypassing

1109
00:51:33,679 --> 00:51:37,639
a lot of the money and the research

1110
00:51:35,449 --> 00:51:40,129
being put into the natural immune system

1111
00:51:37,639 --> 00:51:42,469
which continues to be you know bypassed

1112
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:44,450
because they don't want our natural

1113
00:51:42,469 --> 00:51:46,699
immune system to be first and foremost

1114
00:51:44,449 --> 00:51:48,739
because it's free and it's also because

1115
00:51:46,699 --> 00:51:51,289
we can make those things or we can grow

1116
00:51:48,739 --> 00:51:53,659
those things in our garden so I think

1117
00:51:51,289 --> 00:51:57,469
that you know also one thing we got to

1118
00:51:53,659 --> 00:52:00,170
cut out on before but cannabis is a is a

1119
00:51:57,469 --> 00:52:02,659
stasis it creates stasis in the body and

1120
00:52:00,170 --> 00:52:05,059
the reason why it creates stasis is

1121
00:52:02,659 --> 00:52:06,679
because it's an adaptogen so I think

1122
00:52:05,059 --> 00:52:09,289
that it's really important for us to

1123
00:52:06,679 --> 00:52:11,779
continue to look for natural adaptogens

1124
00:52:09,289 --> 00:52:13,699
and continue to have faith in our immune

1125
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:16,340
system and every time that we take

1126
00:52:13,699 --> 00:52:18,289
antibiotics it's not just the upper

1127
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:20,900
tract of our digestive tract that gets

1128
00:52:18,289 --> 00:52:23,210
washed out it's also our lower digestive

1129
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:25,190
tract as well as different

1130
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:29,809
microorganisms that are inside of our

1131
00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:32,539
blood so unfortunately just like

1132
00:52:29,809 --> 00:52:35,360
balancing with yogurt or a pre or

1133
00:52:32,539 --> 00:52:37,130
probiotic afterward is not truly gonna

1134
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:39,980
help you we keep going back to soil

1135
00:52:37,130 --> 00:52:42,619
microbiology as well as you know birth

1136
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:43,068
so many people now around the world are

1137
00:52:42,619 --> 00:52:47,509
being

1138
00:52:43,068 --> 00:52:49,548
via c-section and completely losing a

1139
00:52:47,509 --> 00:52:52,458
massive amount of the microbiome that

1140
00:52:49,548 --> 00:52:54,498
happens during birth coming through the

1141
00:52:52,458 --> 00:52:59,868
birth canal which sets us up for life

1142
00:52:54,498 --> 00:53:01,909
it's such a tone that we have for ever

1143
00:52:59,869 --> 00:53:04,249
and ever and nothing really can

1144
00:53:01,909 --> 00:53:07,129
necessarily penetrate that but

1145
00:53:04,248 --> 00:53:10,909
unfortunately you know this this virus

1146
00:53:07,130 --> 00:53:13,969
is is is is is telling us something we

1147
00:53:10,909 --> 00:53:16,308
as a human species right now are not

1148
00:53:13,969 --> 00:53:19,190
very healthy so that's the reason why

1149
00:53:16,309 --> 00:53:22,249
it's impacting humanity so much we need

1150
00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:24,708
to look to our immune system continue to

1151
00:53:22,248 --> 00:53:26,568
boost our happiness levels because when

1152
00:53:24,708 --> 00:53:29,298
we're depressed and we don't feel good

1153
00:53:26,568 --> 00:53:31,130
we produce cortisol and that's just a

1154
00:53:29,298 --> 00:53:33,829
bummer so that's all you know really

1155
00:53:31,130 --> 00:53:35,930
work on being happy and I just think

1156
00:53:33,829 --> 00:53:38,509
that and building our immune systems is

1157
00:53:35,929 --> 00:53:40,308
crucial like Mark was saying and you

1158
00:53:38,509 --> 00:53:42,469
know we drink medicinal mushrooms every

1159
00:53:40,309 --> 00:53:44,930
single day because we know there's

1160
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:47,479
toxicity out there and viruses out there

1161
00:53:44,929 --> 00:53:50,808
all the time and medicinal mushrooms

1162
00:53:47,478 --> 00:53:53,179
give you killer T cells and cells that

1163
00:53:50,809 --> 00:53:55,249
go in it attack viruses that come into

1164
00:53:53,179 --> 00:53:57,108
our body and that's what makes us

1165
00:53:55,248 --> 00:53:59,088
healthy even out of the Black Plague

1166
00:53:57,108 --> 00:54:00,528
which killed millions of people that

1167
00:53:59,088 --> 00:54:03,288
people have lived through the Black

1168
00:54:00,528 --> 00:54:07,639
Plague all the sudden lived to 70 and 80

1169
00:54:03,289 --> 00:54:10,160
years old so in order for us as a human

1170
00:54:07,639 --> 00:54:12,139
race to get stronger and live longer we

1171
00:54:10,159 --> 00:54:13,489
have to look at our ultimate health and

1172
00:54:12,139 --> 00:54:15,978
it's not coming from the medical

1173
00:54:13,489 --> 00:54:17,690
industry it's coming from our food and

1174
00:54:15,978 --> 00:54:20,208
it's kind of beautiful that the

1175
00:54:17,690 --> 00:54:22,458
coronavirus is happening in the spring

1176
00:54:20,208 --> 00:54:24,858
right now it's the best time to start a

1177
00:54:22,458 --> 00:54:27,068
garden and a start of food all of the

1178
00:54:24,858 --> 00:54:29,630
videos that we're seeing from

1179
00:54:27,068 --> 00:54:31,548
supermarkets with people you know is

1180
00:54:29,630 --> 00:54:34,099
lined up for aisles trying to get food

1181
00:54:31,548 --> 00:54:35,748
when you know it's a wake-up call to

1182
00:54:34,099 --> 00:54:38,509
start producing some of your own food at

1183
00:54:35,748 --> 00:54:40,129
home and then you can start making your

1184
00:54:38,509 --> 00:54:43,099
own seed which you're gonna continue

1185
00:54:40,130 --> 00:54:45,709
growing but when you eat food from your

1186
00:54:43,099 --> 00:54:49,430
own garden it gives you endophytes and

1187
00:54:45,708 --> 00:54:51,768
it gives you special compounds from the

1188
00:54:49,429 --> 00:54:54,019
soil that help you fight off disease and

1189
00:54:51,768 --> 00:54:57,229
just like our microbiome right now

1190
00:54:54,019 --> 00:55:01,030
as a human species it's totally out of

1191
00:54:57,230 --> 00:55:03,619
balance so is our like faith and and and

1192
00:55:01,030 --> 00:55:05,510
feelings about science we're completely

1193
00:55:03,619 --> 00:55:07,369
out of balance with it we'll continue to

1194
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:09,290
look towards science and away from

1195
00:55:07,369 --> 00:55:11,869
Mother Nature when she's the one that

1196
00:55:09,289 --> 00:55:15,219
has all of the answers we are people of

1197
00:55:11,869 --> 00:55:19,039
Earth I just wanted to make that

1198
00:55:15,219 --> 00:55:22,609
transplant patient did not want a strong

1199
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:25,659
immune system it'll cause rejection of

1200
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:25,660
their organs

1201
00:55:28,969 --> 00:55:33,409
they got there to begin with they're

1202
00:55:30,829 --> 00:55:36,319
having transplants above a bodily part

1203
00:55:33,409 --> 00:55:39,349
because already their microbiome was

1204
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:41,510
already problematic so we have to look

1205
00:55:39,349 --> 00:55:43,670
at the root and not just say oh well

1206
00:55:41,510 --> 00:55:45,980
let's take you know point five percent

1207
00:55:43,670 --> 00:55:48,980
point zero zero five percent of the

1208
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:51,650
whole population and use that bizarre as

1209
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:55,059
our you know basis oh it's not that I'm

1210
00:55:51,650 --> 00:55:58,099
using them as an example it's that you

1211
00:55:55,059 --> 00:56:01,250
that there are groups of people who

1212
00:55:58,099 --> 00:56:06,319
cannot make their immune system as

1213
00:56:01,250 --> 00:56:08,539
strong responsible it'll kill ya you

1214
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:10,880
lost their immune system already to

1215
00:56:08,539 --> 00:56:14,869
begin with their new system is gone and

1216
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:19,340
then they don't patients and they have

1217
00:56:14,869 --> 00:56:21,589
to deal with bring that all together

1218
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:23,960
this the drug that's showing so much

1219
00:56:21,590 --> 00:56:27,980
promise right now is actually initially

1220
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:32,750
found in the bark of a tree so it's

1221
00:56:27,980 --> 00:56:35,289
quinine quinine is basically that's not

1222
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:37,610
chloro quinine right there two different

1223
00:56:35,289 --> 00:56:39,259
Quinn has a chlorine group added to it

1224
00:56:37,610 --> 00:56:40,789
to slow the metabolism of it but it's

1225
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:43,990
believed to have the same mode of action

1226
00:56:40,789 --> 00:56:46,579
but just last longer and then hydroxy

1227
00:56:43,989 --> 00:56:49,519
chloroquine has another hydroxyl group

1228
00:56:46,579 --> 00:56:51,259
hanging off of it somewhere yeah makes a

1229
00:56:49,519 --> 00:56:53,900
little bit safer but isn't that like a

1230
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:59,290
metabolite or something like that yeah

1231
00:56:53,900 --> 00:57:02,930
is it that a metabolite or something or

1232
00:56:59,289 --> 00:57:06,110
something oh you can't you can try to

1233
00:57:02,929 --> 00:57:08,239
mimic it with their metabolized by 3 or

1234
00:57:06,110 --> 00:57:10,880
4 or so CBD slows that

1235
00:57:08,239 --> 00:57:12,199
grapefruit juice slows it down so some

1236
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:14,150
folks are just taking quinine and

1237
00:57:12,199 --> 00:57:16,788
grapefruit juice to try and stretch the

1238
00:57:14,150 --> 00:57:18,559
quinine a little bit further you can get

1239
00:57:16,789 --> 00:57:21,710
quinine and tonic water but it's only at

1240
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:25,280
80 like 83 Meg's per liter so people are

1241
00:57:21,710 --> 00:57:26,780
using this at like 400 to 500 Meg's in

1242
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:29,809
some of the Kovac patient's sometimes

1243
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:31,220
twice a day so I don't know if you get

1244
00:57:29,809 --> 00:57:33,170
there with quinine but you might be able

1245
00:57:31,219 --> 00:57:35,480
to get a prophylactic dose because I'm

1246
00:57:33,170 --> 00:57:37,579
assuming the prophylactic doses don't

1247
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:39,500
need to be as high as the doses required

1248
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:42,010
to treat people that have like millions

1249
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:44,030
of viral particles per microliter right

1250
00:57:42,010 --> 00:57:46,520
if you're looking if you look at the

1251
00:57:44,030 --> 00:57:48,619
qPCR data in coma there's a the viral

1252
00:57:46,519 --> 00:57:51,079
load and the tissues is outrageous it's

1253
00:57:48,619 --> 00:57:53,210
really really high and there's they're

1254
00:57:51,079 --> 00:57:55,010
managing to reduce that with chloroquine

1255
00:57:53,210 --> 00:57:56,809
and hydroxychloroquine so I would

1256
00:57:55,010 --> 00:57:58,880
imagine if you're at an early infectious

1257
00:57:56,809 --> 00:58:01,809
stage and your viral load is really low

1258
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:03,920
you probably don't need the full dose to

1259
00:58:01,809 --> 00:58:06,230
push it off and for it to be

1260
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:08,568
preventative but I don't know it's so

1261
00:58:06,230 --> 00:58:10,099
it's all conjecture right now but I find

1262
00:58:08,568 --> 00:58:11,719
it somewhat reassuring that you know

1263
00:58:10,099 --> 00:58:13,970
this is this is a drug that actually

1264
00:58:11,719 --> 00:58:17,689
like most drugs we found in nature and

1265
00:58:13,969 --> 00:58:19,578
then modified and so it's uh hopefully

1266
00:58:17,690 --> 00:58:21,409
we'll be able to get it to the entire

1267
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:25,490
world my fear about you know chloroquine

1268
00:58:21,409 --> 00:58:27,139
and Hydra Corp and I mean they all of

1269
00:58:25,489 --> 00:58:28,669
them have long QT issues you have to if

1270
00:58:27,139 --> 00:58:29,750
you have a fib I've got a fib so I can't

1271
00:58:28,670 --> 00:58:31,220
take it or I got to take very small

1272
00:58:29,750 --> 00:58:33,260
amounts of it because it can it can

1273
00:58:31,219 --> 00:58:35,058
trigger a fib patients to go into long

1274
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:37,339
QT so it's gotta be monitored with like

1275
00:58:35,059 --> 00:58:40,579
in a live core and Apple watch or

1276
00:58:37,338 --> 00:58:42,259
something but there's gonna be rationing

1277
00:58:40,579 --> 00:58:43,849
issues I think the pharmaceutical comes

1278
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:46,460
already donating millions of doses which

1279
00:58:43,849 --> 00:58:47,720
is a nice of them but I don't know that

1280
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:49,579
it's gonna gets all 7 billion people

1281
00:58:47,719 --> 00:58:51,409
maybe it doesn't need to maybe the virus

1282
00:58:49,579 --> 00:58:53,059
doesn't spread that far but but quinine

1283
00:58:51,409 --> 00:58:55,879
is something that probably could like

1284
00:58:53,059 --> 00:58:58,369
that's an over-the-counter tonic water

1285
00:58:55,880 --> 00:59:00,289
right yeah yeah zinc is a there's

1286
00:58:58,369 --> 00:59:01,940
another good study on if you if you co

1287
00:59:00,289 --> 00:59:03,710
administer it with zinc it's believed

1288
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:04,880
the motive action is still in debate

1289
00:59:03,710 --> 00:59:06,440
even though it's been around for 70

1290
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:08,750
years but one mode of action that's been

1291
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:11,960
proposed is that it's a zinc ionophore

1292
00:59:08,750 --> 00:59:13,579
so transfer zinc into the cell and zinc

1293
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:15,849
is something that stalls the RNA

1294
00:59:13,579 --> 00:59:18,318
polymerase so the virus can't replicate

1295
00:59:15,849 --> 00:59:20,390
but human polymerase is seem to be able

1296
00:59:18,318 --> 00:59:21,690
to handle zinc just fine if you know it

1297
00:59:20,389 --> 00:59:22,949
competes for magnesium

1298
00:59:21,690 --> 00:59:25,829
I think in the in the polymerase is

1299
00:59:22,949 --> 00:59:28,519
class so what's the effective dose to be

1300
00:59:25,829 --> 00:59:31,440
able to control symptom ology in a

1301
00:59:28,519 --> 00:59:34,949
patient that's got advanced symptoms you

1302
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:37,980
know like yeah the famous French paper

1303
00:59:34,949 --> 00:59:40,769
that came out from Ralph's lab was using

1304
00:59:37,980 --> 00:59:43,139
a combination of hydroxychloroquine and

1305
00:59:40,769 --> 00:59:44,550
I think an antibiotic surprisingly to

1306
00:59:43,139 --> 00:59:45,960
your point about antibiotics I don't

1307
00:59:44,550 --> 00:59:47,730
understand the mechanism of that but

1308
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:49,170
that antibiotic is if from ice and I

1309
00:59:47,730 --> 00:59:52,409
think has some activity in a bola

1310
00:59:49,170 --> 00:59:54,090
and I don't I don't know why but

1311
00:59:52,409 --> 00:59:55,889
typically you're right markets they

1312
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:57,269
don't touch viruses but this this one

1313
00:59:55,889 --> 00:59:58,679
particular antibiotic seems to be

1314
00:59:57,269 --> 01:00:00,809
helping and it may also be helping with

1315
00:59:58,679 --> 01:00:02,009
any sepsis or pneumonia based infections

1316
01:00:00,809 --> 01:00:03,779
that are going on so they're kind of

1317
01:00:02,010 --> 01:00:05,760
giving them yeah there's probably all

1318
01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:10,580
kinds of secondary [ __ ] that happens

1319
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:10,580
yeah it's like throw a monkey wrench in

1320
01:00:12,469 --> 01:00:17,639
that's a really important point you know

1321
01:00:15,349 --> 01:00:19,529
everything that we do we really have to

1322
01:00:17,639 --> 01:00:23,460
think about it as you know like dropping

1323
01:00:19,530 --> 01:00:24,990
that stone in a puddle of water and you

1324
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:26,849
know you don't look at the first ripple

1325
01:00:24,989 --> 01:00:29,009
you've got a look at the fiftieth ripple

1326
01:00:26,849 --> 01:00:30,989
and when we're dealing with our you know

1327
01:00:29,010 --> 01:00:33,150
health and well-being that's important

1328
01:00:30,989 --> 01:00:36,059
so well I've had a lot of experience

1329
01:00:33,150 --> 01:00:38,039
with chloroquine after the tsunami I was

1330
01:00:36,059 --> 01:00:41,279
over in the odd-shaped province in

1331
01:00:38,039 --> 01:00:43,949
Indonesia I was working with the w-h-o

1332
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:46,170
you know going down the deep dark holes

1333
01:00:43,949 --> 01:00:48,899
of malaria because there was lots of

1334
01:00:46,170 --> 01:00:52,650
problems after the tsunami bad water I

1335
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:54,750
saw a lot of very you know moderately

1336
01:00:52,650 --> 01:00:56,070
healthy people who were testing positive

1337
01:00:54,750 --> 01:00:58,139
with malaria

1338
01:00:56,070 --> 01:01:00,570
go on chloroquine and then become

1339
01:00:58,139 --> 01:01:03,150
incredibly sick so I don't necessarily

1340
01:01:00,570 --> 01:01:05,100
feel like you know on a personal level

1341
01:01:03,150 --> 01:01:07,079
you know I hear what other people are

1342
01:01:05,099 --> 01:01:10,769
saying out there in the world but I've

1343
01:01:07,079 --> 01:01:13,289
personally you know prescribed you know

1344
01:01:10,769 --> 01:01:15,420
hundreds of people chloroquine and felt

1345
01:01:13,289 --> 01:01:15,659
like that was a really bad road to go

1346
01:01:15,420 --> 01:01:18,269
down

1347
01:01:15,659 --> 01:01:19,859
what was your I'm curious what the side

1348
01:01:18,269 --> 01:01:22,380
effects people should look out for are

1349
01:01:19,860 --> 01:01:23,940
on it I mean I've read about the long QT

1350
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:26,880
stuff but I haven't heard of any you

1351
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:30,240
know a lot of people feebleness you know

1352
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:32,550
people becoming very weak not only just

1353
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:34,619
weak in their body but also sort of weak

1354
01:01:32,550 --> 01:01:36,120
in the mind and you're sort of sitting

1355
01:01:34,619 --> 01:01:38,400
there and talking to them

1356
01:01:36,119 --> 01:01:40,829
even after two days of using it and

1357
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:43,980
their mind can't stick with like the

1358
01:01:40,829 --> 01:01:45,900
same train of thought or you know of

1359
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:48,510
course I was dealing in at every big

1360
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:50,400
disaster area you know there was a lot

1361
01:01:48,510 --> 01:01:52,770
of people that died I was there for a

1362
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:55,440
long time and I know that you know they

1363
01:01:52,769 --> 01:01:57,059
had you know sadness and depression and

1364
01:01:55,440 --> 01:02:00,119
things on their mind at that time but it

1365
01:01:57,059 --> 01:02:03,000
still was like we called it the nine

1366
01:02:00,119 --> 01:02:05,009
yards stairs you know like somebody

1367
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:07,860
looking off into the distance sort of

1368
01:02:05,010 --> 01:02:09,840
nine yards just just not really checked

1369
01:02:07,860 --> 01:02:11,820
into their body and it was almost like

1370
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:13,410
you know the more that they were on the

1371
01:02:11,820 --> 01:02:15,269
chloroquine the more that you know they

1372
01:02:13,409 --> 01:02:19,440
were sort of leaving their body which is

1373
01:02:15,269 --> 01:02:20,969
also like the strength of their weird

1374
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:23,550
dreams on it that's one that's one side

1375
01:02:20,969 --> 01:02:25,619
effect I read about but yeah

1376
01:02:23,550 --> 01:02:27,000
you know the doses for malaria do they

1377
01:02:25,619 --> 01:02:30,089
use more or less of it than they're

1378
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:32,940
thinking about using for for kovat you

1379
01:02:30,090 --> 01:02:34,230
know I don't know I don't know what what

1380
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:37,110
they're saying about it I feel like

1381
01:02:34,230 --> 01:02:40,019
quinine you know is an awesome idea and

1382
01:02:37,110 --> 01:02:41,460
you know we can go down that road and

1383
01:02:40,019 --> 01:02:43,440
talk about it because it's from nature

1384
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:44,909
but then again you know just like Mark

1385
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:47,670
was say and when you start to sympathize

1386
01:02:44,909 --> 01:02:49,769
synthesize things it really changes how

1387
01:02:47,670 --> 01:02:52,289
the body up takes it it understands that

1388
01:02:49,769 --> 01:02:53,699
though you know unfortunately I'm not

1389
01:02:52,289 --> 01:02:55,409
having a whole lot of faith in

1390
01:02:53,699 --> 01:02:57,809
chloroquine right now but that's my own

1391
01:02:55,409 --> 01:02:59,849
personal opinion you know something else

1392
01:02:57,809 --> 01:03:02,519
might come out that you know might be

1393
01:02:59,849 --> 01:03:06,150
awesome but I saw a lot of people have

1394
01:03:02,519 --> 01:03:11,219
depleted immune systems and depleted you

1395
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:13,230
know vibrational energy from it okay and

1396
01:03:11,219 --> 01:03:14,519
I asked three questions I just have

1397
01:03:13,230 --> 01:03:16,650
three questions they could be answered

1398
01:03:14,519 --> 01:03:19,710
in the whole can we ever show cher

1399
01:03:16,650 --> 01:03:21,510
joints again can we clean the glassware

1400
01:03:19,710 --> 01:03:23,820
in between uses so it's safe that we can

1401
01:03:21,510 --> 01:03:26,190
use the same rig if we clean it and

1402
01:03:23,820 --> 01:03:28,530
three will our cannabis gatherings ever

1403
01:03:26,190 --> 01:03:30,059
be safe if we're not sharing but other

1404
01:03:28,530 --> 01:03:33,320
people are and then there's sloughing

1405
01:03:30,059 --> 01:03:33,320
virus everywhere

1406
01:03:33,750 --> 01:03:46,230
select the questions I would be buyers I

1407
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:46,230
have to be able to fire

1408
01:03:48,940 --> 01:03:56,769
your break it out yeah break up they

1409
01:03:54,130 --> 01:03:58,690
brought way in while he's rezoning in as

1410
01:03:56,769 --> 01:04:00,849
I think there's gonna be a resistant

1411
01:03:58,690 --> 01:04:03,280
population because we see that and

1412
01:04:00,849 --> 01:04:05,500
almost all viral infections in any of

1413
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:08,859
the models right now all the models you

1414
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:10,630
have have this exponential curve with an

1415
01:04:08,858 --> 01:04:13,029
R nought of two which is very similar to

1416
01:04:10,630 --> 01:04:16,838
a PCR curve pre CR has an R nought of

1417
01:04:13,030 --> 01:04:18,670
two it doubles every cycle right so but

1418
01:04:16,838 --> 01:04:20,318
all of the all the projections are going

1419
01:04:18,670 --> 01:04:22,269
exponential to the moon they don't have

1420
01:04:20,318 --> 01:04:23,949
an S curve in them and everything in

1421
01:04:22,269 --> 01:04:25,358
nature typically has an S curve and that

1422
01:04:23,949 --> 01:04:28,078
S curve is a combination of social

1423
01:04:25,358 --> 01:04:32,529
distancing of natural immunity of

1424
01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:35,349
education and what have you so I I I'm I

1425
01:04:32,530 --> 01:04:37,060
guess I optimism is healthy for my

1426
01:04:35,349 --> 01:04:39,818
mental state right now I'm looking at

1427
01:04:37,059 --> 01:04:42,519
the graphs and thinking it's not gonna

1428
01:04:39,818 --> 01:04:45,789
be as doom and gloom Zombieland as we're

1429
01:04:42,519 --> 01:04:47,380
seeing out there and so III think we'll

1430
01:04:45,789 --> 01:04:48,969
soon have an immunity to this thing like

1431
01:04:47,380 --> 01:04:52,230
like other cold viruses that come

1432
01:04:48,969 --> 01:04:54,759
through our population that we deal with

1433
01:04:52,230 --> 01:04:58,210
yeah you you made me think of another

1434
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:59,770
fish lyric Kevin right before was we

1435
01:04:58,210 --> 01:05:02,889
were treating the symptom and not the

1436
01:04:59,769 --> 01:05:07,838
cause now expanding exponentially like

1437
01:05:02,889 --> 01:05:12,068
summer eater like summer Harris you

1438
01:05:07,838 --> 01:05:13,480
gotta just drive up and play it cold

1439
01:05:12,068 --> 01:05:23,380
turkey like you no one knows you're

1440
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:27,010
doing it forward thinking and again just

1441
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:29,920
plant and good food around us

1442
01:05:27,010 --> 01:05:31,420
I'm also you know one quick thought to

1443
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:34,659
what you were saying Debbie is if you're

1444
01:05:31,420 --> 01:05:36,519
gonna pass a pipe you can always light

1445
01:05:34,659 --> 01:05:38,618
it with your lighter on the end of the

1446
01:05:36,519 --> 01:05:41,619
pipe for a little while I learned that

1447
01:05:38,619 --> 01:05:43,990
from Bob Snodgrass you know it's a great

1448
01:05:41,619 --> 01:05:45,789
way to burn out anything but you know

1449
01:05:43,989 --> 01:05:47,889
not necessarily during this Tobit time

1450
01:05:45,789 --> 01:05:50,019
by any means but I think that you know

1451
01:05:47,889 --> 01:05:52,480
that could be helpful in a social

1452
01:05:50,019 --> 01:05:54,699
situation but also you know we have to

1453
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:56,409
be into what you know type of

1454
01:05:54,699 --> 01:05:58,509
environment that's been given us and

1455
01:05:56,409 --> 01:06:00,578
also the fact that it's spring right now

1456
01:05:58,510 --> 01:06:03,250
the the shoots that are coming out on

1457
01:06:00,579 --> 01:06:05,980
the trees are extremely powerful

1458
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:07,630
they're really high in vitamin C and and

1459
01:06:05,980 --> 01:06:10,809
Terry Willard brought up the alter

1460
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:12,490
catkins and finding alder trees and and

1461
01:06:10,809 --> 01:06:15,279
the buds that are coming off on and

1462
01:06:12,489 --> 01:06:17,709
making medicine out of the buds you know

1463
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:19,480
like our it's really powerful medicine

1464
01:06:17,710 --> 01:06:20,800
even the pine pollen and different

1465
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:22,869
pollens that are coming out are

1466
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:26,380
extremely useful to our immune systems

1467
01:06:22,869 --> 01:06:28,239
so the the beautiful new growth of life

1468
01:06:26,380 --> 01:06:30,640
that's happening in the spring we can

1469
01:06:28,239 --> 01:06:33,729
utilize in our immune systems right now

1470
01:06:30,639 --> 01:06:35,500
so it's again good timing if we want to

1471
01:06:33,730 --> 01:06:38,019
look towards nature towards some up for

1472
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:40,329
some of our tears even birch bark you

1473
01:06:38,019 --> 01:06:42,759
can boil and drink birch bark and get

1474
01:06:40,329 --> 01:06:46,119
the betcha linic acid that's coming from

1475
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:49,080
the cambium layer which is why Chagas so

1476
01:06:46,119 --> 01:06:52,900
important because chaga has the most

1477
01:06:49,079 --> 01:06:55,179
antioxidants of any herb or plant on

1478
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:57,340
earth and the chaga tree you can also

1479
01:06:55,179 --> 01:07:00,210
tap right now a whole lot of people our

1480
01:06:57,340 --> 01:07:02,500
territory birch trees don't attack the

1481
01:07:00,210 --> 01:07:04,449
birch tree right now and that's

1482
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:07,239
something that you can use directly into

1483
01:07:04,449 --> 01:07:11,109
an IV so you know that's just really

1484
01:07:07,239 --> 01:07:14,529
interesting how tree water and tree

1485
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:17,170
blood is almost identical to you know

1486
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:20,110
the same pH and the same sugars and and

1487
01:07:17,170 --> 01:07:22,180
nutrient value that our blood is pretty

1488
01:07:20,110 --> 01:07:26,370
awesome how nature provides at the same

1489
01:07:22,179 --> 01:07:29,079
time for me Birds polypore is a known

1490
01:07:26,369 --> 01:07:31,179
antiviral antifungal poly Porter that

1491
01:07:29,079 --> 01:07:33,400
was one of the three mushrooms found on

1492
01:07:31,179 --> 01:07:35,829
the ice man in Italy which is very

1493
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:37,900
interesting the three mushrooms that

1494
01:07:35,829 --> 01:07:42,130
were found where the chaga the birch

1495
01:07:37,900 --> 01:07:44,170
polypore and the ama do go ahead and and

1496
01:07:42,130 --> 01:07:45,960
the birch polypore what we know about as

1497
01:07:44,170 --> 01:07:48,639
far as what nature produces it's

1498
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:51,659
absolutely the strongest anti

1499
01:07:48,639 --> 01:07:54,250
environment the strongest anti defector

1500
01:07:51,659 --> 01:07:56,559
thing that the forest grows and it's

1501
01:07:54,250 --> 01:07:58,329
incredibly bitter but what's interesting

1502
01:07:56,559 --> 01:08:01,029
about it is when it grows on the chaga

1503
01:07:58,329 --> 01:08:04,049
tree or when it grows in nature it grows

1504
01:08:01,030 --> 01:08:07,240
on other things than birch but it's

1505
01:08:04,050 --> 01:08:09,610
white and it stays this gorgeous like

1506
01:08:07,239 --> 01:08:12,099
beautiful white color meaning like

1507
01:08:09,610 --> 01:08:14,829
nothing in the forest will attack it so

1508
01:08:12,099 --> 01:08:16,608
that's just we've actually used that as

1509
01:08:14,829 --> 01:08:19,519
a foliar spray on

1510
01:08:16,609 --> 01:08:21,469
ants that have any kind of mildew leaf

1511
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:23,779
eating mildew or any plants that are

1512
01:08:21,469 --> 01:08:25,850
showing rust fungi it's been

1513
01:08:23,779 --> 01:08:27,799
unbelievable we've been able to drink it

1514
01:08:25,850 --> 01:08:30,139
I've given it to children who have had

1515
01:08:27,798 --> 01:08:32,298
wands and they've been able to determine

1516
01:08:30,139 --> 01:08:34,759
themselves within like a week

1517
01:08:32,298 --> 01:08:36,319
it's an unbelievable medicine there's a

1518
01:08:34,759 --> 01:08:38,810
really good there's a really good book

1519
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:40,310
called The Cure ISM of forest and I

1520
01:08:38,810 --> 01:08:42,589
encourage people to get the book the

1521
01:08:40,310 --> 01:08:46,520
cure is in the forest and I think the

1522
01:08:42,588 --> 01:08:53,389
bark is an underutilized medicine by

1523
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:56,210
people bark tree tips even even tree the

1524
01:08:53,389 --> 01:08:58,730
buck read the leaves its are the branch

1525
01:08:56,210 --> 01:09:01,399
itself is the very end is very useful to

1526
01:08:58,729 --> 01:09:03,618
it so I think it's yeah and people the

1527
01:09:01,399 --> 01:09:05,719
ability right now go on a walk let's get

1528
01:09:03,618 --> 01:09:08,358
outside go on walks of course your

1529
01:09:05,719 --> 01:09:11,000
social distancing but right now nature

1530
01:09:08,359 --> 01:09:13,579
just explode a spring and such a

1531
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:16,548
wonderful opportunity to out there and

1532
01:09:13,579 --> 01:09:19,309
you know be the new Frazier thank lactic

1533
01:09:16,548 --> 01:09:22,539
acid bacteria and cover yourself in dirt

1534
01:09:19,310 --> 01:09:29,420
and wash it and face and compost and

1535
01:09:22,539 --> 01:09:31,579
smoke hashish okay I I've seen you know

1536
01:09:29,420 --> 01:09:33,889
I've been we've been because we've been

1537
01:09:31,579 --> 01:09:36,139
inside and we've been following this go

1538
01:09:33,889 --> 01:09:38,719
into the CDC's web site and trying to

1539
01:09:36,139 --> 01:09:41,630
get the latest and greatest instructions

1540
01:09:38,719 --> 01:09:44,329
on what we're to do if we are quarantine

1541
01:09:41,630 --> 01:09:45,889
my family here in my house is quarantine

1542
01:09:44,329 --> 01:09:47,238
we just want to make sure that we're

1543
01:09:45,889 --> 01:09:50,690
doing the right thing and we're you know

1544
01:09:47,238 --> 01:09:53,750
and I've heard mixed things some people

1545
01:09:50,689 --> 01:09:57,319
say that you should go outside and in

1546
01:09:53,750 --> 01:09:58,399
other people I had seen two posts and it

1547
01:09:57,319 --> 01:10:00,368
looked like it was from reputable

1548
01:09:58,399 --> 01:10:02,539
sources where they had a bunch of

1549
01:10:00,368 --> 01:10:06,109
activities and they said please remain

1550
01:10:02,539 --> 01:10:09,649
indoors is there a situation where if

1551
01:10:06,109 --> 01:10:12,139
the virus gets so widespread in your

1552
01:10:09,649 --> 01:10:15,769
community that actually staying indoors

1553
01:10:12,139 --> 01:10:18,170
is what is is more beneficial for the

1554
01:10:15,770 --> 01:10:21,320
collective good of society as opposed to

1555
01:10:18,170 --> 01:10:24,270
going outside as anyone now

1556
01:10:21,319 --> 01:10:26,639
well it's passed by droplets that we

1557
01:10:24,270 --> 01:10:29,130
know so the CDC you know made a decision

1558
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:31,650
a few days ago they were trying to say

1559
01:10:29,130 --> 01:10:34,650
that it was airborne it's not it's

1560
01:10:31,649 --> 01:10:36,809
droplets so being out in nature only

1561
01:10:34,649 --> 01:10:39,449
gives you vitamin D which is absolutely

1562
01:10:36,810 --> 01:10:41,310
imperative to our immune system make

1563
01:10:39,449 --> 01:10:43,260
sure that when you are outside you're

1564
01:10:41,310 --> 01:10:45,960
not totally bundled up you know get

1565
01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:47,640
outside breathe the clean air I think

1566
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:49,170
that it's really important I don't think

1567
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:51,720
that we're gonna be you know nature is

1568
01:10:49,170 --> 01:10:53,730
not passing on the virus human beings

1569
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:55,710
are passing on the virus so if you look

1570
01:10:53,729 --> 01:10:57,239
at the viral load of the area that you

1571
01:10:55,710 --> 01:10:59,340
live and if you live in New York or New

1572
01:10:57,239 --> 01:11:02,250
York City it would be really hard to go

1573
01:10:59,340 --> 01:11:04,020
outside and get that type of thing which

1574
01:11:02,250 --> 01:11:05,520
really points to the fact that people

1575
01:11:04,020 --> 01:11:07,380
living in the country or having that

1576
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:09,780
country home is extremely beneficial

1577
01:11:07,380 --> 01:11:13,440
right now and that is how we've gotten

1578
01:11:09,779 --> 01:11:15,779
through the past sicknesses so going out

1579
01:11:13,439 --> 01:11:17,609
if you live near the country going

1580
01:11:15,779 --> 01:11:19,500
outside and covering yourself in dirt

1581
01:11:17,609 --> 01:11:23,519
breathing that air is going to be your

1582
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:25,590
ultimate health I feel blessed to have a

1583
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:27,840
forest in my backyard things grows

1584
01:11:25,590 --> 01:11:32,010
almost all the mushrooms you guys just

1585
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:34,710
mentioned like mark all right behind the

1586
01:11:32,010 --> 01:11:37,079
house yeah I've been taking walks on the

1587
01:11:34,710 --> 01:11:39,810
beach and in trying to get out a good

1588
01:11:37,079 --> 01:11:41,819
bit here I'm in Massachusetts and you

1589
01:11:39,810 --> 01:11:44,900
know I have a lot of family in New York

1590
01:11:41,819 --> 01:11:47,009
in New York State in New York City and

1591
01:11:44,899 --> 01:11:48,659
you know I've been a resident of New

1592
01:11:47,010 --> 01:11:51,500
York City and I really feel for them

1593
01:11:48,659 --> 01:11:56,039
right now it's geographically it's not a

1594
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:58,800
safe space so you know if you can get

1595
01:11:56,039 --> 01:12:01,050
outside do could you get our pen city if

1596
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:03,090
there's a higher propensity of infected

1597
01:12:01,050 --> 01:12:05,909
patients by definition there could be a

1598
01:12:03,090 --> 01:12:08,640
higher propensity of infected services

1599
01:12:05,909 --> 01:12:11,639
so like you could just be walking I

1600
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:14,640
guess to the store or something put your

1601
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:15,780
hand on the wrong stair railing and get

1602
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:18,180
affected that way

1603
01:12:15,779 --> 01:12:19,139
versus you know I live kind of like in a

1604
01:12:18,180 --> 01:12:21,030
suburb

1605
01:12:19,140 --> 01:12:23,579
I guess I'd call it you know I mean

1606
01:12:21,029 --> 01:12:25,319
there is a population density we lived

1607
01:12:23,579 --> 01:12:27,899
there's an houses around us and stuff

1608
01:12:25,319 --> 01:12:31,170
and certainly like when we go to our

1609
01:12:27,899 --> 01:12:33,009
there's a grocery store where most of we

1610
01:12:31,170 --> 01:12:35,960
mostly shop at

1611
01:12:33,010 --> 01:12:37,489
it's kind of like unlimited services

1612
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:39,020
right now and it's kind of like I've

1613
01:12:37,489 --> 01:12:43,279
never seen it like this I don't remember

1614
01:12:39,020 --> 01:12:46,280
it being like this after 9/11 this is

1615
01:12:43,279 --> 01:12:49,250
like a whole new reality it really it

1616
01:12:46,279 --> 01:12:51,380
really really is yeah I don't know like

1617
01:12:49,250 --> 01:12:55,010
large cities like Los Angeles and New

1618
01:12:51,380 --> 01:12:56,900
York I mean it would you think again

1619
01:12:55,010 --> 01:13:00,280
again I understand this whole flattening

1620
01:12:56,899 --> 01:13:03,409
of the curve but man you need a certain

1621
01:13:00,279 --> 01:13:06,289
fraction of the population to do those

1622
01:13:03,409 --> 01:13:08,989
absolutely essential it's a big fraction

1623
01:13:06,289 --> 01:13:12,470
to if you a really good example is in

1624
01:13:08,989 --> 01:13:14,719
1918 when the Spanish flu hit I think it

1625
01:13:12,470 --> 01:13:16,550
was somewhere in Pennsylvania that you

1626
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:18,800
guys threw this huge parade with like

1627
01:13:16,550 --> 01:13:21,380
two hundred thousand people yeah so then

1628
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:23,270
like 4,500 people died and massive

1629
01:13:21,380 --> 01:13:25,190
casualties into the hospitals over the

1630
01:13:23,270 --> 01:13:28,130
course of the next seven days at the

1631
01:13:25,189 --> 01:13:31,460
exact same time in st. Louis they closed

1632
01:13:28,130 --> 01:13:33,829
schools churches gatherings of 50 or

1633
01:13:31,460 --> 01:13:35,630
more people like everything they just

1634
01:13:33,829 --> 01:13:39,380
closed everything and the end rare curve

1635
01:13:35,630 --> 01:13:41,569
was like this long flat like barely like

1636
01:13:39,380 --> 01:13:44,300
totally non comparable to what went down

1637
01:13:41,569 --> 01:13:46,539
in Philadelphia so that's kind of a good

1638
01:13:44,300 --> 01:13:49,010
sort of historical context of looking

1639
01:13:46,539 --> 01:13:52,430
Philadelphia they have done this before

1640
01:13:49,010 --> 01:13:55,010
like social isolation starving out the

1641
01:13:52,430 --> 01:13:57,770
virus definitely seemed to work at least

1642
01:13:55,010 --> 01:13:59,960
but then man conspiracy folks are just

1643
01:13:57,770 --> 01:14:03,050
going nuts right now like there is some

1644
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:06,859
crazy shot listen I've always had an

1645
01:14:03,050 --> 01:14:08,300
appreciation for the bizarre the nut bar

1646
01:14:06,859 --> 01:14:11,449
that you know like back in the day I

1647
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:12,860
read every single David Icke book I read

1648
01:14:11,449 --> 01:14:15,050
you know started with Robert Anton

1649
01:14:12,859 --> 01:14:16,759
Wilson got into Terrance but then

1650
01:14:15,050 --> 01:14:18,430
Terrance led into David Icke and all

1651
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:20,840
that madness Cathy O'Brien

1652
01:14:18,430 --> 01:14:23,539
transformation of America just the

1653
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:26,930
craziest [ __ ] you could possibly imagine

1654
01:14:23,539 --> 01:14:29,029
and I feel like it's just dangerous to

1655
01:14:26,930 --> 01:14:30,950
Terrance told me something a long time

1656
01:14:29,029 --> 01:14:34,489
mom didn't tell me but through the tapes

1657
01:14:30,949 --> 01:14:38,090
he said the anchor of mankind is belief

1658
01:14:34,489 --> 01:14:41,119
too fervently believe anything is the

1659
01:14:38,090 --> 01:14:42,890
anchor of free thought and when you

1660
01:14:41,119 --> 01:14:44,869
believe something you automatically

1661
01:14:42,890 --> 01:14:46,300
cannot believe it's opposite so what

1662
01:14:44,869 --> 01:14:49,420
I've tried to do in all of

1663
01:14:46,300 --> 01:14:51,640
is just kind of keep an open mind kind

1664
01:14:49,420 --> 01:14:53,199
of like I look at at least my government

1665
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:54,970
here in Canada I don't think they're out

1666
01:14:53,199 --> 01:14:57,099
to get us they're like hey can you guys

1667
01:14:54,970 --> 01:14:59,230
like please just like socially isolate

1668
01:14:57,100 --> 01:15:00,880
like it doesn't seem like the same vibe

1669
01:14:59,229 --> 01:15:02,769
when I talked to my buddy in New York

1670
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:04,600
who's like we're trying to take our guns

1671
01:15:02,770 --> 01:15:08,800
they're trying to make us stay in our

1672
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:10,600
homes and I'm just like well like what a

1673
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:12,010
total difference in the two countries

1674
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:14,530
it's like our government's like can you

1675
01:15:12,010 --> 01:15:17,500
please just stay inside

1676
01:15:14,529 --> 01:15:19,509
Canadians are like I guess so like

1677
01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:21,970
probably what we should do like seems

1678
01:15:19,510 --> 01:15:25,570
like a smart thing to do but then from a

1679
01:15:21,970 --> 01:15:28,570
conspiracy stand part I think years

1680
01:15:25,569 --> 01:15:32,769
later since 1918 we still have a

1681
01:15:28,569 --> 01:15:34,090
hospital bed problem right I think you

1682
01:15:32,770 --> 01:15:39,340
can maybe blame on government but I

1683
01:15:34,090 --> 01:15:40,869
don't know about everything else I'm

1684
01:15:39,340 --> 01:15:42,940
they're saying that you know I think

1685
01:15:40,869 --> 01:15:46,479
it's important to note that it's not

1686
01:15:42,939 --> 01:15:48,279
that people just carry the virus from

1687
01:15:46,479 --> 01:15:50,589
one person to another there's cells

1688
01:15:48,279 --> 01:15:54,189
inside of healthy bodies that attack

1689
01:15:50,590 --> 01:15:56,800
viruses and kill viruses and they're

1690
01:15:54,189 --> 01:15:59,079
talking about using people's people that

1691
01:15:56,800 --> 01:16:01,060
get through the virus have natural

1692
01:15:59,079 --> 01:16:03,220
antibodies in their blood and in their

1693
01:16:01,060 --> 01:16:05,080
bodies that they they're talking about

1694
01:16:03,220 --> 01:16:07,480
you know being able to utilize to create

1695
01:16:05,079 --> 01:16:09,880
cures for it so it's very important for

1696
01:16:07,479 --> 01:16:13,959
people to realize you know how important

1697
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:17,220
it is to be able to process a virus it

1698
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:28,329
happens and it's essential to the

1699
01:16:17,220 --> 01:16:30,490
evolution of humanity how cool it is

1700
01:16:28,329 --> 01:16:36,100
because like two years ago we're felons

1701
01:16:30,489 --> 01:16:37,869
you know probably say it to the

1702
01:16:36,100 --> 01:16:42,430
responsibility of staying open like this

1703
01:16:37,869 --> 01:16:44,050
is pretty overwhelming yeah and you

1704
01:16:42,430 --> 01:16:46,539
actually just got a letter from the

1705
01:16:44,050 --> 01:16:50,560
Department of Ag in Oregon that states

1706
01:16:46,539 --> 01:16:52,840
because we are an agricultural company

1707
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:55,870
and we have a lot of agricultural

1708
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:57,730
licenses that were allowed to go on

1709
01:16:55,869 --> 01:16:59,118
about our business as long as we keep

1710
01:16:57,729 --> 01:17:01,218
social distance so

1711
01:16:59,118 --> 01:17:03,198
for us it's really awesome we're gonna

1712
01:17:01,219 --> 01:17:04,880
you know be responsible I don't know if

1713
01:17:03,198 --> 01:17:07,848
other people are necessarily responsible

1714
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:09,409
out there but it it's pretty funny

1715
01:17:07,849 --> 01:17:13,010
Debbie you know you're you're saying

1716
01:17:09,408 --> 01:17:15,439
that you know we used to be you know on

1717
01:17:13,010 --> 01:17:17,270
the outs and now they're pretty much

1718
01:17:15,439 --> 01:17:19,848
they sent us a license in the mail

1719
01:17:17,270 --> 01:17:22,369
saying go ahead continue to deliver your

1720
01:17:19,849 --> 01:17:23,750
CBD to people so that's what we're doing

1721
01:17:22,368 --> 01:17:25,399
we're just going to continue to be able

1722
01:17:23,750 --> 01:17:26,929
to get the medicine out there so I was

1723
01:17:25,399 --> 01:17:28,969
really thankful to get a letter from the

1724
01:17:26,929 --> 01:17:34,340
Department of Ag saying go on about your

1725
01:17:28,969 --> 01:17:35,929
business but I do hear that that's does

1726
01:17:34,340 --> 01:17:37,849
that extend to all your like

1727
01:17:35,929 --> 01:17:39,500
subcontractors and all the people who

1728
01:17:37,849 --> 01:17:44,869
supply you I mean that's that's where it

1729
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:47,899
seems like he gets a little foggy we

1730
01:17:44,868 --> 01:17:49,399
have we have to have already had a lot

1731
01:17:47,899 --> 01:17:53,000
of our product cuz it's really difficult

1732
01:17:49,399 --> 01:17:55,279
right now to get you know supplies yeah

1733
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:57,889
it doesn't it doesn't pass over to our

1734
01:17:55,279 --> 01:18:00,380
suppliers by any means but what it does

1735
01:17:57,889 --> 01:18:03,560
do is it helps it keep it keep it open

1736
01:18:00,380 --> 01:18:05,989
so that if they shut down certain postal

1737
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:08,840
services to certain businesses or areas

1738
01:18:05,988 --> 01:18:11,149
that they that we will continue to get

1739
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:14,210
mail you know as long as they continue

1740
01:18:11,149 --> 01:18:16,939
to stay open but it's specific to just

1741
01:18:14,210 --> 01:18:19,189
our company and as far as supplies the

1742
01:18:16,939 --> 01:18:21,678
lucky thing is we've chosen to live near

1743
01:18:19,189 --> 01:18:23,629
a wilderness so we have endless supplies

1744
01:18:21,679 --> 01:18:26,480
of medicinal mushrooms that we will be

1745
01:18:23,630 --> 01:18:30,079
able to continue to have medicine no

1746
01:18:26,479 --> 01:18:32,149
matter what happens so I'd love to hear

1747
01:18:30,079 --> 01:18:34,488
from Jack and hear about what's going on

1748
01:18:32,149 --> 01:18:36,408
with the most vulnerable because you

1749
01:18:34,488 --> 01:18:38,238
know the people that are like blessed

1750
01:18:36,408 --> 01:18:40,279
enough to own properties and have

1751
01:18:38,238 --> 01:18:42,319
forests in their backyard and have all

1752
01:18:40,279 --> 01:18:45,529
this clean water and not be worried

1753
01:18:42,319 --> 01:18:48,109
about like how are the vulnerable people

1754
01:18:45,529 --> 01:18:50,750
of the streets feeling right now during

1755
01:18:48,109 --> 01:18:52,399
all of this Jack they look like this

1756
01:18:50,750 --> 01:18:57,408
like how I look right now

1757
01:18:52,399 --> 01:19:01,339
ah it's terrible man like I like you

1758
01:18:57,408 --> 01:19:04,488
said I feel very privileged because I'm

1759
01:19:01,340 --> 01:19:06,889
looking out at a forest in front of me

1760
01:19:04,488 --> 01:19:11,859
because I bailed out the reason I bailed

1761
01:19:06,889 --> 01:19:14,630
out is because they closed all of the

1762
01:19:11,859 --> 01:19:17,059
shelter areas which you know

1763
01:19:14,630 --> 01:19:19,400
legitimately if you have rooms that have

1764
01:19:17,060 --> 01:19:21,500
hundreds of people on mats right beside

1765
01:19:19,399 --> 01:19:23,539
each other they they can't be open but

1766
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:25,670
those people are all on the main

1767
01:19:23,539 --> 01:19:27,409
corridor streets of downtown like

1768
01:19:25,670 --> 01:19:29,920
usually on the main blocks where there's

1769
01:19:27,409 --> 01:19:35,269
maybe 20 to 50 people during the day

1770
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:36,890
there was probably 200-300 on each block

1771
01:19:35,270 --> 01:19:39,410
like so there's almost a thousand people

1772
01:19:36,890 --> 01:19:43,780
like in the main Aires all dragging

1773
01:19:39,409 --> 01:19:43,779
their tents and their [ __ ] behind them I

1774
01:19:43,869 --> 01:19:50,439
like don't want to be all panicky you

1775
01:19:48,199 --> 01:19:54,349
know but I talked to the bureaucrats and

1776
01:19:50,439 --> 01:19:57,109
the language that they speak in without

1777
01:19:54,350 --> 01:19:59,780
actually saying the words or one time

1778
01:19:57,109 --> 01:20:02,989
saying the words when all the services

1779
01:19:59,779 --> 01:20:06,170
are shut down they ask me how many

1780
01:20:02,989 --> 01:20:09,439
outreach workers can I supply because

1781
01:20:06,170 --> 01:20:12,649
what they think they're gonna do or try

1782
01:20:09,439 --> 01:20:14,449
to do is you know how we have military

1783
01:20:12,649 --> 01:20:17,659
bases and stuff they want to corral

1784
01:20:14,449 --> 01:20:20,179
everybody so they can figure out who's

1785
01:20:17,659 --> 01:20:23,119
sick and who's not sick isolate the sick

1786
01:20:20,180 --> 01:20:26,810
people from the not sick people and then

1787
01:20:23,119 --> 01:20:29,359
have all of my staff who generally like

1788
01:20:26,810 --> 01:20:31,340
work inside of a building where people

1789
01:20:29,359 --> 01:20:33,349
consume drugs and that's where they

1790
01:20:31,340 --> 01:20:35,239
watch them to keep them safe that

1791
01:20:33,350 --> 01:20:38,030
they'll be going out and watching people

1792
01:20:35,239 --> 01:20:40,039
in the community and having people like

1793
01:20:38,029 --> 01:20:43,369
the drug users and people who who live

1794
01:20:40,039 --> 01:20:45,439
in those SROs helping one another in

1795
01:20:43,369 --> 01:20:47,779
these communities that they'll build

1796
01:20:45,439 --> 01:20:52,779
that will keep the sick people isolated

1797
01:20:47,779 --> 01:20:56,750
from the not sick people it it honestly

1798
01:20:52,779 --> 01:20:59,029
and as you can imagine like if you had a

1799
01:20:56,750 --> 01:21:02,119
500 dollar drug habit a day which you

1800
01:20:59,029 --> 01:21:03,649
had to do many crimes for yeah but what

1801
01:21:02,119 --> 01:21:06,949
are you gonna do like when they say hey

1802
01:21:03,649 --> 01:21:10,039
man you have to go self isolate so again

1803
01:21:06,949 --> 01:21:12,710
I had some pretty high level of doctors

1804
01:21:10,039 --> 01:21:15,560
call me like last Monday from the

1805
01:21:12,710 --> 01:21:18,409
province and say they're not from the

1806
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:21,100
province from a housing place and they

1807
01:21:18,409 --> 01:21:24,319
said what would we

1808
01:21:21,100 --> 01:21:27,050
what will we have to do to get people to

1809
01:21:24,319 --> 01:21:28,488
go in their rooms for two weeks and

1810
01:21:27,050 --> 01:21:31,340
selves isolate and I said you already

1811
01:21:28,488 --> 01:21:33,829
know what the answer to that is lots of

1812
01:21:31,340 --> 01:21:36,100
drugs yeah and so they said okay so if

1813
01:21:33,829 --> 01:21:39,769
we offered morphine or hydro Mars

1814
01:21:36,100 --> 01:21:42,890
tablets and dexedrine to the people who

1815
01:21:39,770 --> 01:21:44,360
used methamphetamines what else do you

1816
01:21:42,890 --> 01:21:46,910
think we would have to give them and

1817
01:21:44,359 --> 01:21:50,179
could your outreach workers go out and

1818
01:21:46,909 --> 01:21:52,010
try to make it happen yeah yeah yeah

1819
01:21:50,180 --> 01:21:54,140
like get buy-in from people because we

1820
01:21:52,010 --> 01:21:56,090
know that we won't get buy-in because

1821
01:21:54,140 --> 01:22:01,280
the tenants don't trust us you know what

1822
01:21:56,090 --> 01:22:02,779
I mean we're the landlord so that didn't

1823
01:22:01,279 --> 01:22:04,639
happen all last week I thought that

1824
01:22:02,779 --> 01:22:06,769
would happen right away as a way to get

1825
01:22:04,640 --> 01:22:08,719
people to go in their rooms but it seems

1826
01:22:06,770 --> 01:22:10,400
like they're trying to have some kind of

1827
01:22:08,719 --> 01:22:13,039
bar cuz you can imagine that if you

1828
01:22:10,399 --> 01:22:16,309
started giving somebody tablets to stay

1829
01:22:13,039 --> 01:22:17,659
in their room for a thing like this why

1830
01:22:16,310 --> 01:22:18,950
would you want to take them away at the

1831
01:22:17,659 --> 01:22:20,569
end of the two weeks they're gonna go

1832
01:22:18,949 --> 01:22:22,670
back to committing street crimes at

1833
01:22:20,569 --> 01:22:24,649
great cost to themselves in society you

1834
01:22:22,670 --> 01:22:26,659
can take the tablets away from them that

1835
01:22:24,649 --> 01:22:28,539
you give them right now so I imagine

1836
01:22:26,659 --> 01:22:31,849
they're having some larger philosophical

1837
01:22:28,539 --> 01:22:34,340
and structural things trying to figure

1838
01:22:31,850 --> 01:22:36,410
out how that they would keep it going at

1839
01:22:34,340 --> 01:22:38,630
the U this is something that's long

1840
01:22:36,409 --> 01:22:40,880
gonna be long term like a year year and

1841
01:22:38,630 --> 01:22:44,180
a half so it may only really help for

1842
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:47,300
somebody like myself whose job is to

1843
01:22:44,180 --> 01:22:49,100
fight for D Krim and clean access to

1844
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:51,380
drugs and [ __ ] like that because this

1845
01:22:49,100 --> 01:22:55,700
crisis may force them to just give drugs

1846
01:22:51,380 --> 01:23:01,430
to drug addicts in order to keep them

1847
01:22:55,699 --> 01:23:02,988
isolated you know and you know me and my

1848
01:23:01,430 --> 01:23:05,060
kids were both sick before this whole

1849
01:23:02,988 --> 01:23:07,399
[ __ ] started so I just decided like this

1850
01:23:05,060 --> 01:23:09,650
is just too confusing and stressful so

1851
01:23:07,399 --> 01:23:11,389
and I was lucky enough to be able to

1852
01:23:09,649 --> 01:23:13,099
bail out and come to the country where

1853
01:23:11,390 --> 01:23:16,160
we could figure out a couple weeks if

1854
01:23:13,100 --> 01:23:20,210
you know that we're good

1855
01:23:16,159 --> 01:23:22,159
it's uh it makes my anxiety levels go up

1856
01:23:20,210 --> 01:23:24,500
for those people to be honest like it's

1857
01:23:22,159 --> 01:23:26,510
one point yeah you know family and home

1858
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:29,539
and all that mark

1859
01:23:26,510 --> 01:23:31,400
Marcus man you know what we have I think

1860
01:23:29,539 --> 01:23:33,350
my last member count like two weeks ago

1861
01:23:31,399 --> 01:23:37,069
is 1700s

1862
01:23:33,350 --> 01:23:40,640
and so for example with the giveaways to

1863
01:23:37,069 --> 01:23:43,009
keep people we follow BC CDC protocols

1864
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:45,380
so they don't want people close to each

1865
01:23:43,010 --> 01:23:47,539
other so anybody who comes for just a a

1866
01:23:45,380 --> 01:23:49,670
giveaway we give the joints away in the

1867
01:23:47,539 --> 01:23:52,010
street now we just have people standing

1868
01:23:49,670 --> 01:23:53,630
on our block we're like here you go here

1869
01:23:52,010 --> 01:23:56,659
you go keep going you know what I mean

1870
01:23:53,630 --> 01:23:58,819
like don't don't come in the store and

1871
01:23:56,659 --> 01:24:00,739
they about reach office unless you need

1872
01:23:58,819 --> 01:24:02,599
a narcan kid don't come to the cost

1873
01:24:00,739 --> 01:24:06,800
recovery service unless you're using it

1874
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:08,690
and and even in the street population

1875
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:10,130
people are panicking them like you can

1876
01:24:08,689 --> 01:24:13,639
tell with the numbers that they're

1877
01:24:10,130 --> 01:24:15,199
stocking up with the idea that one one

1878
01:24:13,640 --> 01:24:18,380
day that they'll force us to close our

1879
01:24:15,199 --> 01:24:21,979
doors so that's the impression like what

1880
01:24:18,380 --> 01:24:24,140
going on for the people in the community

1881
01:24:21,979 --> 01:24:28,189
and them yeah I think man what if one of

1882
01:24:24,140 --> 01:24:28,760
the members had it yeah I don't want to

1883
01:24:28,189 --> 01:24:31,369
be all dark

1884
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:36,890
you know what I mean like all sir but it

1885
01:24:31,369 --> 01:24:38,630
is it is it is dark it is stress

1886
01:24:36,890 --> 01:24:43,700
provoking to think about like though

1887
01:24:38,630 --> 01:24:46,340
with the what the what ifs right and my

1888
01:24:43,699 --> 01:24:48,139
my partner she like she's the kind of

1889
01:24:46,340 --> 01:24:51,380
the BA the boss of a lot of frontline

1890
01:24:48,140 --> 01:24:53,480
services so I know that talking to her

1891
01:24:51,380 --> 01:24:56,750
and the other managers they're

1892
01:24:53,479 --> 01:24:58,639
definitely taking steps to make sure

1893
01:24:56,750 --> 01:25:00,800
that everybody has all the information

1894
01:24:58,640 --> 01:25:02,840
about trying to protect themselves and

1895
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:05,360
all that but it definitely does seem

1896
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:09,590
pretty pretty scary and I think that

1897
01:25:05,359 --> 01:25:11,359
we'll see like some pretty modified work

1898
01:25:09,590 --> 01:25:13,730
protocols for a long time that I'll

1899
01:25:11,359 --> 01:25:16,909
actually probably change some of the

1900
01:25:13,729 --> 01:25:19,569
course of drug policies you know doesn't

1901
01:25:16,909 --> 01:25:22,460
leave everybody prescriptions medically

1902
01:25:19,569 --> 01:25:24,469
in an emergency time then that will

1903
01:25:22,460 --> 01:25:27,050
change the way they when we look at

1904
01:25:24,470 --> 01:25:29,270
change in laws later oh yeah we cooler

1905
01:25:27,050 --> 01:25:31,699
people are able to look inward I mean

1906
01:25:29,270 --> 01:25:34,130
I'll tell you yesterday at like seven

1907
01:25:31,699 --> 01:25:36,139
o'clock at night in Vancouver people

1908
01:25:34,130 --> 01:25:38,480
hung out their apartment windows and

1909
01:25:36,140 --> 01:25:41,570
clapped for the health work care workers

1910
01:25:38,479 --> 01:25:44,269
in in Vancouver oh wow like it was like

1911
01:25:41,569 --> 01:25:46,069
you could hear people just like clapping

1912
01:25:44,270 --> 01:25:46,480
all throughout the city and that was

1913
01:25:46,069 --> 01:25:49,130
like

1914
01:25:46,479 --> 01:25:51,049
Vancouver's never done that that's

1915
01:25:49,130 --> 01:25:52,520
they've never shown any any type of

1916
01:25:51,050 --> 01:25:54,650
respect like that so you know that

1917
01:25:52,520 --> 01:25:57,170
people are paying attention to this and

1918
01:25:54,649 --> 01:25:59,869
they're looking inward and it gives us

1919
01:25:57,170 --> 01:26:02,510
an opportunity as humanity to be human

1920
01:25:59,869 --> 01:26:06,619
you know to choose humanity the thing

1921
01:26:02,510 --> 01:26:09,920
that we are over this sort of reptilian

1922
01:26:06,619 --> 01:26:13,519
sort of emotional list non empathetic

1923
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:16,640
non compassionate mentality of just like

1924
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:18,440
capitalism or whatever and hopefully you

1925
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:20,180
know that's that's a good thing I think

1926
01:26:18,439 --> 01:26:22,009
that people are kind of being a little

1927
01:26:20,180 --> 01:26:24,170
more conscious like okay like maybe this

1928
01:26:22,010 --> 01:26:26,119
is better if we help each other maybe

1929
01:26:24,170 --> 01:26:29,899
this is better if we support each other

1930
01:26:26,119 --> 01:26:35,720
rather than it's all for one and one for

1931
01:26:29,899 --> 01:26:38,179
all so much small learner all of a

1932
01:26:35,720 --> 01:26:40,369
sudden were realizing yes I definitely

1933
01:26:38,180 --> 01:26:42,500
hear what you're saying Jack you know it

1934
01:26:40,369 --> 01:26:45,769
is definitely gonna be a socio-economic

1935
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:48,350
thing people that are struggling have a

1936
01:26:45,770 --> 01:26:50,510
higher chance of you know maybe

1937
01:26:48,350 --> 01:26:52,760
contracting the virus because of health

1938
01:26:50,510 --> 01:26:54,829
issues also because they don't have a

1939
01:26:52,760 --> 01:26:59,810
safe environment necessarily to go to

1940
01:26:54,829 --> 01:27:01,850
and also this is not a sides thing this

1941
01:26:59,810 --> 01:27:03,680
is not a oh this country against this

1942
01:27:01,850 --> 01:27:06,650
country and I can choose a side like

1943
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:08,750
we're all vulnerable to this we all now

1944
01:27:06,649 --> 01:27:11,809
have this ability to connect on such a

1945
01:27:08,750 --> 01:27:13,399
beautiful human level that we can look

1946
01:27:11,810 --> 01:27:14,960
at people like you are just saying

1947
01:27:13,399 --> 01:27:16,909
Marcus that they're doing the same thing

1948
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:19,189
all over Europe hanging out their

1949
01:27:16,909 --> 01:27:21,949
windows at a certain time and they're

1950
01:27:19,189 --> 01:27:25,429
clapping at the same time and it's like

1951
01:27:21,949 --> 01:27:27,829
hey we are all together I've been I more

1952
01:27:25,430 --> 01:27:30,740
than ever I've actually felt during this

1953
01:27:27,829 --> 01:27:32,960
whole thing like this beautiful global

1954
01:27:30,739 --> 01:27:35,300
community the people that are reaching

1955
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:37,970
out to us are from all over the world I

1956
01:27:35,300 --> 01:27:39,800
get emails and and messages on my DM

1957
01:27:37,970 --> 01:27:42,740
from our Instagram that's just so

1958
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:45,470
beautiful and connecting so I mean

1959
01:27:42,739 --> 01:27:48,409
something is opening up there it's

1960
01:27:45,470 --> 01:27:51,289
creating some kind of an opening for us

1961
01:27:48,409 --> 01:27:54,289
to be able to have success on another

1962
01:27:51,289 --> 01:27:56,359
level it's an opportunity we have to be

1963
01:27:54,289 --> 01:27:58,789
able to look at the [ __ ] that's been

1964
01:27:56,359 --> 01:27:59,779
given us in this horrible pandemic and

1965
01:27:58,789 --> 01:28:02,569
find some

1966
01:27:59,779 --> 01:28:06,229
kind of opportunity in it so that we can

1967
01:28:02,569 --> 01:28:08,960
grow and and really align ourselves with

1968
01:28:06,229 --> 01:28:11,719
a higher vibration because I don't think

1969
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:13,520
that humanity really has the issue it

1970
01:28:11,720 --> 01:28:15,920
has the ability to go to a higher

1971
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:18,530
vibration unless we're faced with things

1972
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:21,319
that are painful nothing makes us work

1973
01:28:18,529 --> 01:28:23,569
harder than things that are painful so

1974
01:28:21,319 --> 01:28:26,479
I'm really encouraging everybody out

1975
01:28:23,569 --> 01:28:28,369
there to just like have a look at it and

1976
01:28:26,479 --> 01:28:30,679
let's go deeper and let's try to reach

1977
01:28:28,369 --> 01:28:32,689
this vibration that were that we all

1978
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:35,539
need to be able to get rid of this virus

1979
01:28:32,689 --> 01:28:37,399
and Marcus does you know in Canada

1980
01:28:35,539 --> 01:28:39,979
instead of the scare mongers there's the

1981
01:28:37,399 --> 01:28:44,829
care mongers so you know see what you

1982
01:28:39,979 --> 01:28:44,829
can do in your communities to be awesome

1983
01:28:48,760 --> 01:28:53,869
my question is very simple

1984
01:28:51,439 --> 01:28:56,449
howdy how do you roll drinks without

1985
01:28:53,869 --> 01:29:04,460
touching the paper or licking at going

1986
01:28:56,449 --> 01:29:07,189
to glue it take dab no forgiving joints

1987
01:29:04,460 --> 01:29:10,489
away he means I guess you could exactly

1988
01:29:07,189 --> 01:29:13,129
you could roll them with machines the

1989
01:29:10,489 --> 01:29:14,899
rock tones the rock cones you just you

1990
01:29:13,130 --> 01:29:17,000
don't have to glue or stick anything you

1991
01:29:14,899 --> 01:29:20,949
just stuff it in there and you could

1992
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:20,949
twist the end with gloved hands I guess

1993
01:29:21,100 --> 01:29:32,690
I would cover my hands and dirt first

1994
01:29:24,770 --> 01:29:34,910
and then roll the joint out I haven't

1995
01:29:32,689 --> 01:29:37,939
smoked a joint in so many years it's

1996
01:29:34,909 --> 01:29:40,189
just not even funny but well I did smoke

1997
01:29:37,939 --> 01:29:42,739
a pure hash joint but not like joint

1998
01:29:40,189 --> 01:29:44,989
joint I miss joints I miss I missed that

1999
01:29:42,739 --> 01:29:47,630
I ruined joints for myself I smoked foam

2000
01:29:44,989 --> 01:29:49,760
elf hash for for like two and a half

2001
01:29:47,630 --> 01:29:52,159
years every single day just had an

2002
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:55,039
incredible collection it was like Rene

2003
01:29:52,159 --> 01:29:56,809
and he's a sweet skunk and wish to bury

2004
01:29:55,039 --> 01:29:58,519
all these great hash plants all these

2005
01:29:56,810 --> 01:30:00,110
great things and then after two and a

2006
01:29:58,520 --> 01:30:01,640
half years I realized oh my god I got to

2007
01:30:00,109 --> 01:30:04,059
smoke a joint and when I lit the joint

2008
01:30:01,640 --> 01:30:06,680
and tried to smoke it it tasted like

2009
01:30:04,060 --> 01:30:09,140
like a camel's [ __ ] I don't know it

2010
01:30:06,680 --> 01:30:11,360
was just terrible it was burnt just

2011
01:30:09,140 --> 01:30:16,690
nasty I could I never could go

2012
01:30:11,359 --> 01:30:20,210
I totally roomed joints for myself us I

2013
01:30:16,689 --> 01:30:24,439
usually love joints again I used to live

2014
01:30:20,210 --> 01:30:28,899
in a cloud of smoke you had the world's

2015
01:30:24,439 --> 01:30:32,869
best hash - let's put it you know maybe

2016
01:30:28,899 --> 01:30:35,929
there's more gray - a joint would taste

2017
01:30:32,869 --> 01:30:37,640
pretty good I think so yeah if I ran out

2018
01:30:35,930 --> 01:30:39,020
of it for a long time you know that's

2019
01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:40,760
the thing because I used to get into

2020
01:30:39,020 --> 01:30:42,200
these debates online where people would

2021
01:30:40,760 --> 01:30:43,430
be like I'll always smoke doing

2022
01:30:42,199 --> 01:30:45,289
something like have you ever had full

2023
01:30:43,430 --> 01:30:47,570
melt hash in your stash for like five

2024
01:30:45,289 --> 01:30:49,699
years straight Wow know what I'm like

2025
01:30:47,569 --> 01:30:52,699
I'll get back to me when you do hello

2026
01:30:49,699 --> 01:30:54,710
jack I have a question which is how did

2027
01:30:52,699 --> 01:30:58,010
the joints get robbed that you gave away

2028
01:30:54,710 --> 01:31:04,010
I mean did you touch them where they

2029
01:30:58,010 --> 01:31:07,190
lived no no I used to like babe way way

2030
01:31:04,010 --> 01:31:10,970
way back in the day we we had to hand

2031
01:31:07,189 --> 01:31:12,829
roll but no other I used somebody add

2032
01:31:10,970 --> 01:31:14,570
another dispensaries future role of

2033
01:31:12,829 --> 01:31:16,460
machines and then when they went to a

2034
01:31:14,569 --> 01:31:21,500
white bar company we just bought our own

2035
01:31:16,460 --> 01:31:26,810
machines so I have only one he will have

2036
01:31:21,500 --> 01:31:29,960
one human doing production who himself

2037
01:31:26,810 --> 01:31:31,430
lives in a fairly isolated scenario

2038
01:31:29,960 --> 01:31:35,300
doesn't member a lot of contact with

2039
01:31:31,430 --> 01:31:38,570
other people and since we are like I do

2040
01:31:35,300 --> 01:31:41,480
run Health Canada sites I follow all of

2041
01:31:38,569 --> 01:31:43,399
the protocols as best we can to try to

2042
01:31:41,479 --> 01:31:48,439
keep people away from each other you

2043
01:31:43,399 --> 01:31:49,909
know and no no licking no don't lick the

2044
01:31:48,439 --> 01:31:52,009

2045
01:31:49,909 --> 01:31:54,529

2080
01:33:49,139 --> 01:33:54,989
this guy Jake who works with calyx down

2081

and I just in the u.s. somewhere they

2082
01:33:54,988 --> 01:33:58,529
stacked really nice on top of one

2083

it's a square container you can open it

2086
01:34:03,420 --> 01:34:09,569
with one hand all you do is really

2087
01:34:05,310 --> 01:34:12,840
squeeze on the on the lid and what I

2088

like about it also is it's a good amount

2089
01:34:12,840 --> 01:34:19,980
of extract for sure add some bubble hash

2090

some some wedding cake that I got from

2091
01:34:19,979 --> 01:34:27,119
my agent rated X but it also has a

2092
01:34:23,250 --> 01:34:32,789
little turf skirt about this a little

2093
01:34:27,119 --> 01:34:37,019
PTF terpene protecting cover from

2094
01:34:32,789 --> 01:34:38,359
consuming your plastic lid PTFE PTFE

2095
01:34:37,020 --> 01:34:40,040
yeah sorry

2096
01:34:38,359 --> 01:34:42,109
same thing we used when we did the

2097
01:34:40,039 --> 01:34:43,760
terpenes inside the terpene lids because

2098
01:34:42,109 --> 01:34:45,408
some of those companies weren't using

2099
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:48,079
those and it was crazy how the Terps

2100
01:34:45,408 --> 01:34:49,698
were just consuming the inside of the

2101
01:34:48,079 --> 01:34:52,309
container it would make this weird

2102
01:34:49,698 --> 01:34:57,349
plasticky sticky mass so I gotta give

2103
01:34:52,310 --> 01:35:00,580
these guys up to MVP that's a what fep

2104
01:34:57,350 --> 01:35:04,880
liner oh there you go thank you Mike

2105
01:35:00,579 --> 01:35:12,519
Mike would know he turned me on join

2106
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:15,139
people set what's the f EP he's unmuting

2107
01:35:12,520 --> 01:35:18,980
it's similar to it's similar but it's

2108
01:35:15,139 --> 01:35:21,219
not as reactive to terpenes that's one

2109
01:35:18,979 --> 01:35:24,439
of the things that they're saying that I

2110
01:35:21,219 --> 01:35:29,859
suppose fpp makes better of that cleat

2111
01:35:24,439 --> 01:35:29,859
it's essentially a clear transparent

2112
01:35:30,279 --> 01:35:36,109
liner but anti-state jerking proof

2113
01:35:33,738 --> 01:35:38,629
moisture oxygen blocking barrier and

2114
01:35:36,109 --> 01:35:40,158
it's got a Oh ringing in it mm-hmm I

2115
01:35:38,630 --> 01:35:42,050
like them I really do

2116
01:35:40,158 --> 01:35:43,698
I like the jars man have you noticed

2117
01:35:42,050 --> 01:35:48,110
that it keeps your stash better longer

2118
01:35:43,698 --> 01:35:51,500
question mark um you know I smoke my

2119
01:35:48,109 --> 01:35:55,789
stash pretty quick I'll just be honest

2120
01:35:51,500 --> 01:35:57,948
oh but it I just like the access that I

2121
01:35:55,789 --> 01:36:00,380
have I like the size of it I like the

2122
01:35:57,948 --> 01:36:03,198
way they stack in my Pelican case and I

2123
01:36:00,380 --> 01:36:07,460
like that they're just a me they need my

2124
01:36:03,198 --> 01:36:10,939
Ron bases and recycled glass or hemp

2125
01:36:07,460 --> 01:36:14,329
flat those are my only two complaints

2126
01:36:10,939 --> 01:36:16,819
because I like I do like I've been clear

2127
01:36:14,329 --> 01:36:19,359
bothers you can show off your oil but

2128
01:36:16,819 --> 01:36:23,059
that clear bottoms gonna let in UV light

2129
01:36:19,359 --> 01:36:26,420
alternatively if you have a like my Ron

2130
01:36:23,060 --> 01:36:28,130
or some sort of cobalt in code for Amber

2131
01:36:26,420 --> 01:36:32,600
glass that's gonna reduce the amount of

2132
01:36:28,130 --> 01:36:35,900
UV degradation it does have a seal in it

2133
01:36:32,600 --> 01:36:37,789
though so I'm impressed with the shelf

2134
01:36:35,899 --> 01:36:40,339
stability of the smell especially in

2135
01:36:37,789 --> 01:36:42,469
higher I'm just not a fan of these ones

2136
01:36:40,340 --> 01:36:44,630
you gotta push down and open I don't

2137
01:36:42,469 --> 01:36:47,239
think they're quite as good of a jar

2138
01:36:44,630 --> 01:36:48,770
they just don't seem to we kind of have

2139
01:36:47,238 --> 01:36:50,988
to carry that we have to carry those in

2140
01:36:48,770 --> 01:36:51,590
California unfortunately due to the you

2141
01:36:50,988 --> 01:36:56,379
know the

2142
01:36:51,590 --> 01:36:59,569
controls here - here tonight yeah

2143
01:36:56,380 --> 01:37:00,949
because it causes a major problem for a

2144
01:36:59,569 --> 01:37:03,769
lot of people who will get older to have

2145
01:37:00,949 --> 01:37:06,500
arthritis and it's a major problem with

2146
01:37:03,770 --> 01:37:08,870
these concentrates is there not one

2147
01:37:06,500 --> 01:37:11,510
everything is printed so small that's a

2148
01:37:08,869 --> 01:37:14,269
problem too then people who suffer from

2149
01:37:11,510 --> 01:37:16,369
any type of hand debilitation it

2150
01:37:14,270 --> 01:37:18,110
definitely has a very difficult time

2151
01:37:16,369 --> 01:37:19,760
getting into them so that's something

2152
01:37:18,109 --> 01:37:22,399
we're working with the state on that we

2153
01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:24,320
have to do better as well as especially

2154
01:37:22,399 --> 01:37:26,569
environmentally-sound because they're

2155
01:37:24,319 --> 01:37:28,670
still ungodly amount of over packaging

2156
01:37:26,569 --> 01:37:31,819
and plastics for small amount of

2157
01:37:28,670 --> 01:37:33,980
concentrates it's it's obnoxious and

2158
01:37:31,819 --> 01:37:36,829
we're not even talking the pans so it's

2159
01:37:33,979 --> 01:37:38,539
just what we have to carry carry in for

2160
01:37:36,829 --> 01:37:41,479
the product to get it out the door what

2161
01:37:38,539 --> 01:37:44,239
we're loading on to the consumer is

2162
01:37:41,479 --> 01:37:48,639
still overbearing and outrageous for

2163
01:37:44,239 --> 01:37:52,250
what they're they're buying really yeah

2164
01:37:48,640 --> 01:37:56,780
factories Corona does anybody know if

2165
01:37:52,250 --> 01:38:01,399
the majority of patients who have corona

2166
01:37:56,779 --> 01:38:04,279
if they got it from droplets from people

2167
01:38:01,399 --> 01:38:06,889
coughing or from their hands from

2168
01:38:04,279 --> 01:38:11,059
touching contaminated surface

2169
01:38:06,890 --> 01:38:14,180
does anybody know he said this is this

2170
01:38:11,060 --> 01:38:15,410
is colony I I have two people that are

2171
01:38:14,180 --> 01:38:18,350
close to me that have it in New York

2172
01:38:15,409 --> 01:38:22,880
City and one of them got turned away

2173
01:38:18,350 --> 01:38:24,320
from the hospital yesterday and they

2174
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:27,890
believe they got it from touching

2175
01:38:24,319 --> 01:38:29,779
surface areas that's the only way that

2176
01:38:27,890 --> 01:38:33,230
they they weren't around people that

2177
01:38:29,779 --> 01:38:34,969
they remember sneezing or some things

2178
01:38:33,229 --> 01:38:37,069
they don't have the symptoms like some

2179
01:38:34,970 --> 01:38:38,990
people carry it without the symptoms so

2180
01:38:37,069 --> 01:38:40,909
it's you ever know if you touch the

2181
01:38:38,989 --> 01:38:43,460
surface or if you inhaled it in the air

2182
01:38:40,909 --> 01:38:54,229
or if you yeah yes that's what's scary

2183
01:38:43,460 --> 01:38:56,569
about it as soon as we get stolen Sam

2184
01:38:54,229 --> 01:38:58,129
that was he was trying to ask me a

2185
01:38:56,569 --> 01:39:01,069
question a while back but I keep getting

2186
01:38:58,130 --> 01:39:05,380
a kid kept interrupting me it was just

2187
01:39:01,069 --> 01:39:08,079
about the joints oh right thank you

2188
01:39:05,380 --> 01:39:10,569
sorry distracted by children we heard

2189
01:39:08,079 --> 01:39:12,369
regarding droplets we had everybody

2190
01:39:10,569 --> 01:39:15,130
especially says it could survive on

2191
01:39:12,369 --> 01:39:16,479
paper since we handle cash as well as

2192
01:39:15,130 --> 01:39:18,340
plastic cards we had everybody

2193
01:39:16,479 --> 01:39:20,678
immediately go to gloves a couple of

2194
01:39:18,340 --> 01:39:22,840
weeks ago so that's something once we

2195
01:39:20,679 --> 01:39:33,699
heard about immediately we implemented

2196
01:39:22,840 --> 01:39:35,739
before and during the CDs so the same

2197
01:39:33,698 --> 01:39:37,928
thing as I have the guys wearing gloves

2198
01:39:35,738 --> 01:39:40,899
because of physical money that's the

2199
01:39:37,929 --> 01:39:43,329
best thing that I can do right here in

2200
01:39:40,899 --> 01:39:45,579
Holland the majority of businesses no

2201
01:39:43,329 --> 01:39:50,139
longer take cash you have to pay with

2202
01:39:45,579 --> 01:39:51,789
the with the big card that's what I came

2203
01:39:50,139 --> 01:39:55,480
across here trying to implement a

2204
01:39:51,789 --> 01:39:59,229
cashless society research I've done that

2205
01:39:55,479 --> 01:40:02,619
I can show you guys it's to promote the

2206
01:39:59,229 --> 01:40:05,408
false round globe theory I'm just joking

2207
01:40:02,619 --> 01:40:06,969
yeah we don't get that Debbie and I can

2208
01:40:05,408 --> 01:40:08,859
attest we don't get that love here in

2209
01:40:06,969 --> 01:40:11,380
California we definitely have to have

2210
01:40:08,859 --> 01:40:13,809
access to cash or even ATMs on site

2211
01:40:11,380 --> 01:40:15,880
because everybody rolls around in a very

2212
01:40:13,810 --> 01:40:17,920
much cashless society and that's just

2213
01:40:15,880 --> 01:40:20,800
the reality of what they're trying to do

2214
01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:23,770
but the reality that we deal with that

2215
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:25,840
we have to pay our taxes in cash and all

2216
01:40:23,770 --> 01:40:30,340
that we still have to deal with heavily

2217
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:32,289
in cash so we always stay or to try to

2218
01:40:30,340 --> 01:40:34,480
stay up-to-date on things such as this

2219
01:40:32,289 --> 01:40:36,340
so that we can you know respond and

2220
01:40:34,479 --> 01:40:40,029
react accordingly because you can always

2221
01:40:36,340 --> 01:40:42,400
launder your cash you know with maybe

2222
01:40:40,029 --> 01:40:44,679
you VC or something like there's UVC

2223
01:40:42,399 --> 01:41:01,479
bulbs that we should do a whole show on

2224
01:40:44,679 --> 01:41:04,149
that Kevin Thomas financials you guys

2225
01:41:01,479 --> 01:41:07,658
know those guys they do this very high

2226
01:41:04,149 --> 01:41:09,009
level scrutiny to FinCEN standards and

2227
01:41:07,658 --> 01:41:11,429
then somehow hook you up with a bank

2228
01:41:09,010 --> 01:41:14,619
that's FDIC approved so we've been

2229
01:41:11,429 --> 01:41:16,329
officially formally lelee banking for

2230
01:41:14,619 --> 01:41:17,500
about two weeks now after we got kicked

2231
01:41:16,329 --> 01:41:19,479

01:41:33,880 --> 01:41:39,220
credit unions seaport that I worked with

2237

for a year it's wonderful yeah

2238

there's you know information to be

2241
01:41:46,630 --> 01:41:51,730
shared I would I'd love to read on it

kicking you out

2248
01:42:02,770 --> 01:42:07,470

kicked out of all the finest large banks

2250

and small banks the latest one ten years

2251
01:42:20,079 --> 01:42:25,779
ago they weren't so nervous so original

2252
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:27,550
operators of magnolia walked and talked

2253
01:42:25,779 --> 01:42:29,829
to the president told him what they were

2254
01:42:27,550 --> 01:42:31,539
doing they said fine ten years later

2255
01:42:29,829 --> 01:42:35,229
they revile you ated their stand on

2256
01:42:31,539 --> 01:42:36,880
things and just sent a note saying we're

2257
01:42:35,229 --> 01:42:39,279
closing your accounts on this day it was

2258
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:41,260
like three weeks I I called my phone

2259
01:42:39,279 --> 01:42:43,359
that's not fair really you know it's not

2260
01:42:41,260 --> 01:42:45,520
enough time for me to get things going

2261
01:42:43,359 --> 01:42:48,909
they gave me an extra week and that was

2262
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:51,310
that but I give us any reason when they

2263
01:42:48,909 --> 01:42:55,689
closed our bank accounts up here yeah

2264
01:42:51,310 --> 01:42:58,000
it's run the whole gambit from day

2265
01:42:55,689 --> 01:43:00,909
before payroll getting a call saying the

2266
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:02,220
checks in the mail you're done oh that's

2267
01:43:00,909 --> 01:43:05,710
that's lovely

2268
01:43:02,220 --> 01:43:07,900
as well as it's usually just the same

2269
01:43:05,710 --> 01:43:11,439
it's just the it's federally illegal or

2270
01:43:07,899 --> 01:43:13,689
there was an audit done from some and we

2271
01:43:11,439 --> 01:43:16,239
were contacted by the feds that we can't

2272
01:43:13,689 --> 01:43:19,960
do with your cannabis account and blah

2273
01:43:16,239 --> 01:43:22,630
blah blah blah so since like I said 38

2274
01:43:19,960 --> 01:43:24,819
so they're each one's been different but

2275
01:43:22,630 --> 01:43:27,789
all of them mostly the same usually

2276
01:43:24,819 --> 01:43:30,699
checks on the way expect it you're done

2277
01:43:27,789 --> 01:43:31,210
with us so we always investigate and

2278
01:43:30,699 --> 01:43:33,250
have

2279
01:43:31,210 --> 01:43:37,720
a couple in our back pocket in

2280
01:43:33,250 --> 01:43:38,859
preparation yeah because you have to do

2281
01:43:37,720 --> 01:43:40,570
that that's the reality

2282
01:43:38,859 --> 01:43:42,279
I just want to act normal that's all we

2283
01:43:40,569 --> 01:43:44,170
want to do is be normal businesses

2284
01:43:42,279 --> 01:43:46,960
because we are normal retail businesses

2285
01:43:44,170 --> 01:43:50,289
but the frustration is none of us can

2286
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:53,980
use proper banks or when we do you have

2287
01:43:50,289 --> 01:43:56,680
a limited time only yeah ain't that the

2288
01:43:53,979 --> 01:43:59,949
truth well one trip I can give one tip I

2289
01:43:56,680 --> 01:44:02,079
can give for Canadians I was in Colombia

2290
01:43:59,949 --> 01:44:04,019
I don't know if it was six months ago or

2291
01:44:02,079 --> 01:44:07,689
something and I was standing in line to

2292
01:44:04,020 --> 01:44:10,690
to get checked in onto the plane and it

2293
01:44:07,689 --> 01:44:12,399
was another woman just one woman and she

2294
01:44:10,689 --> 01:44:14,679
was a Canadian woman who was like

2295
01:44:12,399 --> 01:44:16,569
working with the banks in Colombia

2296
01:44:14,680 --> 01:44:18,520
Canadian bank but doing you know

2297
01:44:16,569 --> 01:44:20,109
building everything up and I told her

2298
01:44:18,520 --> 01:44:22,120
you know I've had as a cannabis company

2299
01:44:20,109 --> 01:44:23,829
I've had some problems with with the

2300
01:44:22,119 --> 01:44:26,319
banks in Canada and she's like oh that's

2301
01:44:23,829 --> 01:44:28,029
strange so we started talking about it

2302
01:44:26,319 --> 01:44:30,639
and she finally started asking me

2303
01:44:28,029 --> 01:44:32,769
questions and she said she said you

2304
01:44:30,640 --> 01:44:34,360
don't have American accounts do you and

2305
01:44:32,770 --> 01:44:38,410
I said well yeah of course and she said

2306
01:44:34,359 --> 01:44:40,029
oh that's that's where it's half and I'm

2307
01:44:38,409 --> 01:44:41,920
like what do you mean and she's like

2308
01:44:40,029 --> 01:44:44,439
well if you were operational with a bank

2309
01:44:41,920 --> 01:44:46,119
for 15 plus years and then overnight

2310
01:44:44,439 --> 01:44:47,919
they hit you up and said they were

2311
01:44:46,119 --> 01:44:50,590
closing your accounts I can guarantee

2312
01:44:47,920 --> 01:44:53,260
you from working at banks but that would

2313
01:44:50,590 --> 01:44:55,270
have come from America because they know

2314
01:44:53,260 --> 01:44:57,789
if you have American money in your bank

2315
01:44:55,270 --> 01:44:59,230
account like they know they they like to

2316
01:44:57,789 --> 01:45:01,720
know where their money is they can

2317
01:44:59,229 --> 01:45:03,339
investigate American accounts and if

2318
01:45:01,720 --> 01:45:04,690
they just did a little research on yours

2319
01:45:03,340 --> 01:45:06,340
and decided they didn't like what you

2320
01:45:04,689 --> 01:45:08,279
were doing they could have they have the

2321
01:45:06,340 --> 01:45:10,480
power to absolutely call the bank and

2322
01:45:08,279 --> 01:45:12,309
because the relationships are the

2323
01:45:10,479 --> 01:45:15,489
Canadian banks are terrified of

2324
01:45:12,310 --> 01:45:17,200
upsetting the big American banks because

2325
01:45:15,489 --> 01:45:19,210
everything goes through the big American

2326
01:45:17,199 --> 01:45:20,229
banks like you can't do money transfers

2327
01:45:19,210 --> 01:45:23,020
without going through Chase Manhattan

2328
01:45:20,229 --> 01:45:25,089
you can't do any of this stuff even in

2329
01:45:23,020 --> 01:45:27,400
Canada without those big American banks

2330
01:45:25,090 --> 01:45:28,840
so a lot of that if you're in the

2331
01:45:27,399 --> 01:45:31,359
cannabis industry and you're having

2332
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:34,449
problems with banks it's a little bit of

2333
01:45:31,359 --> 01:45:36,130
a bummer to lose that exchange each time

2334
01:45:34,449 --> 01:45:38,949
but that could be the difference between

2335
01:45:36,130 --> 01:45:41,920
having your accounts closed up here and

2336
01:45:38,949 --> 01:45:43,539
and not having them at close what do you

2337
01:45:41,920 --> 01:45:44,350
think and again I'm just thinking out

2338
01:45:43,539 --> 01:45:47,699
loud here that

2339
01:45:44,350 --> 01:45:51,010
could just be a matter of like the whole

2340
01:45:47,699 --> 01:45:54,720
federal I'm not the federal regulation

2341
01:45:51,010 --> 01:45:58,930
but just this this w-h-o thing or this

2342
01:45:54,720 --> 01:46:01,060
United Nations stupid thing that as soon

2343
01:45:58,930 --> 01:46:03,070
as that thing just triggers that

2344
01:46:01,060 --> 01:46:05,140
there'll be some bank like Bank of

2345
01:46:03,069 --> 01:46:08,529
America or one of these large big banks

2346
01:46:05,140 --> 01:46:11,190
who say you know what half of our [ __ ]

2347
01:46:08,529 --> 01:46:14,319
workforce are cannabis patients it's

2348
01:46:11,189 --> 01:46:16,659
okay to do business with the cannabis

2349
01:46:14,319 --> 01:46:19,149
industry and completely open the

2350
01:46:16,659 --> 01:46:21,519
industry with welcomed arms in fact have

2351
01:46:19,149 --> 01:46:24,549
like marketing deals marketing towards

2352
01:46:21,520 --> 01:46:27,820
the 80s and the Debbie's and trying to

2353
01:46:24,550 --> 01:46:30,310
get all of this money I mean it to me

2354
01:46:27,819 --> 01:46:32,739
it's like it's an untapped opportunity

2355
01:46:30,310 --> 01:46:36,370
we already know that the market is there

2356
01:46:32,739 --> 01:46:39,039
right so the fact is is that ATMs

2357
01:46:36,369 --> 01:46:41,500
business needs financial services they

2358
01:46:39,039 --> 01:46:43,600
need point-of-sale transactions they

2359
01:46:41,500 --> 01:46:45,340
need to be able to pay their paychecks

2360
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:47,770
do other expenses through all their

2361
01:46:45,340 --> 01:46:50,350
taxes and all that stuff that any

2362
01:46:47,770 --> 01:46:53,260
business needs right why is the cannabis

2363
01:46:50,350 --> 01:46:55,930
industry still being penalized it's

2364
01:46:53,260 --> 01:46:59,260
because there's 280 [ __ ] or this

2365
01:46:55,930 --> 01:47:02,440
[ __ ] federal and this international

2366
01:46:59,260 --> 01:47:04,900
[ __ ] stupid treaty that all the money

2367
01:47:02,439 --> 01:47:08,109
is somehow kind of I always think that

2368
01:47:04,899 --> 01:47:09,909
you know who is the executive in the

2369
01:47:08,109 --> 01:47:11,559
bank that just closed down

2370
01:47:09,909 --> 01:47:14,019
Debbie's account who is the guy who

2371
01:47:11,560 --> 01:47:15,700
basically signed off yeah it's okay

2372
01:47:14,020 --> 01:47:17,860
let's just close down again they'll

2373
01:47:15,699 --> 01:47:21,420
bounce to some other bank it's like his

2374
01:47:17,859 --> 01:47:24,609
business is now losing account that's

2375
01:47:21,420 --> 01:47:27,220
generating revenue they're gonna just go

2376
01:47:24,609 --> 01:47:29,679
to another bank for just another

2377
01:47:27,220 --> 01:47:31,329
executive maybe that dudes a weed smoker

2378
01:47:29,680 --> 01:47:36,220
and he won't shut him down

2379
01:47:31,329 --> 01:47:38,380
I mean it's there's so much illegal

2380
01:47:36,220 --> 01:47:40,360
activity happening through banks so many

2381
01:47:38,380 --> 01:47:42,340
criminals way more sophisticated and

2382
01:47:40,359 --> 01:47:44,079
dangerous than us and just like

2383
01:47:42,340 --> 01:47:46,810
everything we're always the low-hanging

2384
01:47:44,079 --> 01:47:48,909
fruit for the feds they use us to wedge

2385
01:47:46,810 --> 01:47:50,560
into taking away civil liberties locking

2386
01:47:48,909 --> 01:47:53,019
up huge populations of people and just

2387
01:47:50,560 --> 01:47:54,640
being general you know super jerks

2388
01:47:53,020 --> 01:47:56,530
I think the banks are afraid that if

2389
01:47:54,640 --> 01:47:57,760
they have us in there we're on every

2390
01:47:56,529 --> 01:48:00,189
website in town

2391
01:47:57,760 --> 01:48:02,469
no the feds will open the door and see

2392
01:48:00,189 --> 01:48:04,210
all the really criminal stuff that the

2393
01:48:02,469 --> 01:48:06,788
banks are engaged in so they don't want

2394
01:48:04,210 --> 01:48:09,578
us in there you guys see that HBS see

2395
01:48:06,788 --> 01:48:13,210
like men in your faction money

2396
01:48:09,578 --> 01:48:18,189
laundering suitcases and when they got

2397
01:48:13,210 --> 01:48:19,288
bagged they got a fine you got to

2398
01:48:18,189 --> 01:48:22,149
understand though there's a great

2399
01:48:19,288 --> 01:48:23,859
passion for Debbie Debbie used to come

2400
01:48:22,149 --> 01:48:26,679

2401

2406

01:48:51,670 --> 01:48:54,309
even believe it

2413
01:48:52,389 --> 01:48:56,019
oh you know I got involved because I

2414
01:48:54,309 --> 01:48:59,949
want to stop criminals like serious

2415
01:48:56,019 --> 01:49:03,070
people etc etc knows off but until I had

2416
01:48:59,948 --> 01:49:04,750
a kid but then I realized those guys had

2417
01:49:03,069 --> 01:49:07,238
guns so I asked if I could get switched

2418
01:49:04,750 --> 01:49:09,368
over to the marijuana Department where I

2419
01:49:07,238 --> 01:49:10,779
could just go after marijuana users like

2420
01:49:09,368 --> 01:49:14,649
are you [ __ ] kidding me

2421
01:49:10,779 --> 01:49:16,658
coward coward yeah that sounds about

2422
01:49:14,649 --> 01:49:19,118
right though it's like hoof low-hanging

2423
01:49:16,658 --> 01:49:27,518
fruit versus like work and put your life

2424
01:49:19,118 --> 01:49:31,058
on the line exactly but it also but lets

2425
01:49:27,519 --> 01:49:32,800
me even to it for us to understand you

2426
01:49:31,059 --> 01:49:34,059
know sons do understand know your enemy

2427
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:36,519
better than you know yourself you know

2428
01:49:34,059 --> 01:49:38,590
understand what their mindset is you

2429
01:49:36,519 --> 01:49:40,300
know I I still watch cops and other

2430
01:49:38,590 --> 01:49:41,889
things I just want to understand their

2431
01:49:40,300 --> 01:49:44,260
modus operandi what are they actually

2432
01:49:41,889 --> 01:49:47,260
doing how are they interacting people

2433
01:49:44,260 --> 01:49:48,820
understand their mentality gives you a

2434
01:49:47,260 --> 01:49:50,170
better understanding about what you're

2435
01:49:48,819 --> 01:49:52,960
dealing with what you're fighting

2436
01:49:50,170 --> 01:49:55,929
against because again they're humans too

2437
01:49:52,960 --> 01:49:59,109
and eventually we were able to connect

2438
01:49:55,929 --> 01:50:01,389
with enough grassroots people and around

2439
01:49:59,109 --> 01:50:03,670
that we were able to change laws in

2440
01:50:01,389 --> 01:50:05,260
states that we changed that momentum

2441
01:50:03,670 --> 01:50:08,230
that went from it's never gonna happen

2442
01:50:05,260 --> 01:50:11,770
in your lifetime kid to when's it coming

2443
01:50:08,229 --> 01:50:14,739
to my state you know it's I it

2444
01:50:11,770 --> 01:50:17,110
understand that for a cop or someone in

2445
01:50:14,739 --> 01:50:20,739
law enforcement I don't understand that

2446
01:50:17,109 --> 01:50:24,339
for a banker for a banker who's who's

2447
01:50:20,739 --> 01:50:25,449
watching the economy go and now what you

2448
01:50:24,340 --> 01:50:29,650
see I don't know if you've seen these

2449
01:50:25,449 --> 01:50:31,960
numbers 18 but actually cannabis story

2450
01:50:29,649 --> 01:50:34,269
revenues are up in California right

2451
01:50:31,960 --> 01:50:36,220
because people again they're buying lots

2452
01:50:34,270 --> 01:50:38,680
of toilet paper and buying lots of stuff

2453
01:50:36,220 --> 01:50:41,590
with the flautist when they go but you

2454
01:50:38,680 --> 01:50:44,289
know the point is is that someone in the

2455
01:50:41,590 --> 01:50:46,690
bank who's a financial guy not a law

2456
01:50:44,289 --> 01:50:48,789
enforcement is saying now we can't do

2457
01:50:46,689 --> 01:50:53,710
this we have to keep this client out

2458
01:50:48,789 --> 01:50:55,029
it's like but pop do you really think

2459
01:50:53,710 --> 01:50:56,710
that they're just making that decision

2460
01:50:55,029 --> 01:50:58,929
or do you think there's a memo from the

2461
01:50:56,710 --> 01:51:05,770
Defense Department or some other high

2462
01:50:58,930 --> 01:51:08,890
ranking government they always say

2463
01:51:05,770 --> 01:51:11,380
really sorry you're really cool we had a

2464
01:51:08,890 --> 01:51:14,410
great relationship but it's not me it's

2465
01:51:11,380 --> 01:51:17,079
come from above 99% of the time okay I

2466
01:51:14,409 --> 01:51:19,659
believe it does so do you think that

2467
01:51:17,079 --> 01:51:24,010
there's like what like people at the DEA

2468
01:51:19,659 --> 01:51:26,920
who drip on these senior executives in

2469
01:51:24,010 --> 01:51:29,079
the banks no I don't think the DEA are

2470
01:51:26,920 --> 01:51:31,149
involved at all I think it goes with and

2471
01:51:29,079 --> 01:51:32,829
they're like over here the banks are

2472
01:51:31,149 --> 01:51:34,509
here and whoever is telling the bank's

2473
01:51:32,829 --> 01:51:36,819
probably the White House so what

2474
01:51:34,510 --> 01:51:38,079
so Marcus what do you think not that it

2475
01:51:36,819 --> 01:51:40,170
makes a difference but what was the

2476
01:51:38,079 --> 01:51:42,760
kernel that led to Debbie's bank

2477
01:51:40,170 --> 01:51:44,980
basically giving them the boot what was

2478
01:51:42,760 --> 01:51:46,869
the thing that first started like was

2479
01:51:44,979 --> 01:51:48,639
weird you know I don't know I'm just

2480
01:51:46,869 --> 01:51:51,159
trying to think like why am I always

2481
01:51:48,640 --> 01:51:53,740
thinking I always think this this is a

2482
01:51:51,159 --> 01:51:57,550
group of people that have a very very

2483
01:51:53,739 --> 01:51:59,649
very different mentality quite possibly

2484
01:51:57,550 --> 01:52:02,470
the opposite of the mentality that

2485
01:51:59,649 --> 01:52:04,479
cannabis gives you attention and it's

2486
01:52:02,470 --> 01:52:07,030
the greatest fear they have is that

2487
01:52:04,479 --> 01:52:09,519
while they're trying to continually

2488
01:52:07,029 --> 01:52:12,159
brainwash society with their beliefs and

2489
01:52:09,520 --> 01:52:14,680
their core values that aren't really

2490
01:52:12,159 --> 01:52:17,380
everyone else's beliefs and core values

2491
01:52:14,680 --> 01:52:20,350
that they just that nothing cuts through

2492
01:52:17,380 --> 01:52:22,180
that [ __ ] better than Erb while

2493
01:52:20,350 --> 01:52:23,980
cutting through the [ __ ] of their

2494
01:52:22,180 --> 01:52:24,960
pharmaceutical lies while cutting

2495
01:52:23,979 --> 01:52:27,149
through the [ __ ]

2496
01:52:24,960 --> 01:52:29,609
their justice system while cutting like

2497
01:52:27,149 --> 01:52:33,420
it's just it's the ultimate enemy to

2498
01:52:29,609 --> 01:52:34,979
this long-term agenda of just you know

2499
01:52:33,420 --> 01:52:36,719
whatever it is I don't like to go too

2500
01:52:34,979 --> 01:52:38,549
deep down the rabbit hole and think it's

2501
01:52:36,719 --> 01:52:42,569
some huge conspiracy I like to call it

2502
01:52:38,550 --> 01:52:44,489
an agenda because a conspiracy and and

2503
01:52:42,569 --> 01:52:46,559
you know it sort of insinuates that

2504
01:52:44,488 --> 01:52:48,389
maybe it's not happening at all it's

2505
01:52:46,560 --> 01:52:53,100
just all make-believe but this we know

2506
01:52:48,390 --> 01:52:55,680
this is happening the word Pro Spira see

2507
01:52:53,100 --> 01:52:58,350
and also you know mark one thing I was

2508
01:52:55,680 --> 01:52:59,250
trying to say or thinking about is weird

2509
01:52:58,350 --> 01:53:01,200
well but thanks

2510
01:52:59,250 --> 01:53:03,060
you know last I heard they've all been

2511
01:53:01,199 --> 01:53:05,189
bailed out by the government so who's

2512
01:53:03,060 --> 01:53:07,200
really in charge of the bank's you know

2513
01:53:05,189 --> 01:53:08,879
like the the mass amount of money that

2514
01:53:07,199 --> 01:53:11,369
banks even have to be able to be running

2515
01:53:08,880 --> 01:53:14,250
right now it's from somebody up above

2516
01:53:11,369 --> 01:53:15,930
them so the banker is not making it yeah

2517
01:53:14,250 --> 01:53:18,300
they're all nationalize now I mean

2518
01:53:15,930 --> 01:53:20,489
you're just giving notice that they can

2519
01:53:18,300 --> 01:53:21,949
do zero reserve lending so they're

2520
01:53:20,488 --> 01:53:24,269
lending out money they don't have

2521
01:53:21,949 --> 01:53:25,979
they've been doing that for a long time

2522
01:53:24,270 --> 01:53:27,860
it's always been levered though they've

2523
01:53:25,979 --> 01:53:30,750
always had like a forty to one ratio of

2524
01:53:27,859 --> 01:53:32,279
you know what does it call fractional

2525
01:53:30,750 --> 01:53:34,219
reserve right they've always says but

2526
01:53:32,279 --> 01:53:36,420
they put out a note on Sunday saying

2527
01:53:34,219 --> 01:53:38,189
fractional reserve they can loan money

2528
01:53:36,420 --> 01:53:40,770
they don't have but this is just like

2529
01:53:38,189 --> 01:53:42,689
when money went from gold to not

2530
01:53:40,770 --> 01:53:45,300
representing gold anymore to just now

2531
01:53:42,689 --> 01:53:47,279
represent a paper that you print this is

2532
01:53:45,300 --> 01:53:49,829
just the next version of that which is

2533
01:53:47,279 --> 01:53:51,809
terrifying what's the exchange today

2534
01:53:49,829 --> 01:53:55,170
between a dollar in a year oh it was

2535
01:53:51,810 --> 01:53:56,940
almost unity right I mean right

2536
01:53:55,170 --> 01:53:59,430
oh nothing dollar a year maybe a dollar

2537
01:53:56,939 --> 01:54:01,049
in the pound am I thinking I haven't

2538
01:53:59,430 --> 01:54:03,210
been tracking that particularly currency

2539
01:54:01,050 --> 01:54:05,760
pair but we're all printing money like

2540
01:54:03,210 --> 01:54:08,880
mad right now so it's it's correct do

2541
01:54:05,760 --> 01:54:10,980
comparison so what's the log isn't the

2542
01:54:08,880 --> 01:54:13,500
long-term impact is that that's gonna

2543
01:54:10,979 --> 01:54:18,299
ultimately devalue the currency and like

2544
01:54:13,500 --> 01:54:20,238
the next say hey yeah and full of years

2545
01:54:18,300 --> 01:54:23,820
stay from three to five years from now a

2546
01:54:20,238 --> 01:54:26,009
bunch of currency today the trick with

2547
01:54:23,819 --> 01:54:28,319
the money supply between there you go

2548
01:54:26,010 --> 01:54:30,119
between um I think the last crash in

2549
01:54:28,319 --> 01:54:32,189
this one 2008 in this one huh however

2550
01:54:30,119 --> 01:54:33,329
they didn't train it from helicopters

2551
01:54:32,189 --> 01:54:34,799
would give it to people they gave it to

2552
01:54:33,329 --> 01:54:36,809
bankers and it didn't necessarily

2553
01:54:34,800 --> 01:54:38,680
there's a Kantian effect it didn't

2554
01:54:36,810 --> 01:54:40,110
really get into the economy completely

2555
01:54:38,680 --> 01:54:42,369
so it we probably haven't seen

2556
01:54:40,109 --> 01:54:44,349
widespread inflation we've been seeing

2557
01:54:42,369 --> 01:54:47,170
inflation x' and certain arteries that

2558
01:54:44,350 --> 01:54:48,820
they're subsidizing but I think what's

2559
01:54:47,170 --> 01:54:50,440
gonna happen next is we'll probably see

2560
01:54:48,819 --> 01:54:52,840
inflation a little bit more immediately

2561
01:54:50,439 --> 01:54:54,579
because they are gonna probably rein it

2562
01:54:52,840 --> 01:54:56,050
on everything they can

2563
01:54:54,579 --> 01:55:10,300
it seems to be the only trick they have

2564
01:54:56,050 --> 01:55:17,020
right now we should grow weeds these

2565
01:55:10,300 --> 01:55:19,930
crappy remember when we first got closed

2566
01:55:17,020 --> 01:55:21,430
down by Bank of America before that they

2567
01:55:19,930 --> 01:55:22,930
loved us they knew what we were doing we

2568
01:55:21,430 --> 01:55:25,420
used to go down and the teller would be

2569
01:55:22,930 --> 01:55:28,119
like and smell the money be like we love

2570
01:55:25,420 --> 01:55:31,600
you guys and they were even talking

2571
01:55:28,119 --> 01:55:34,180
about giving us a house loan and then at

2572
01:55:31,600 --> 01:55:36,970
that point they told us that there was

2573
01:55:34,180 --> 01:55:39,610
some wing of their company that

2574
01:55:36,970 --> 01:55:40,990
evaluated these kind of I don't know

2575
01:55:39,609 --> 01:55:43,269
sinful I don't know what you would call

2576
01:55:40,989 --> 01:55:45,819
them the activities and whenever they

2577
01:55:43,270 --> 01:55:47,050
flagged one in their banking system they

2578
01:55:45,819 --> 01:55:49,090
would look at it and if they've been

2579
01:55:47,050 --> 01:55:50,860
there and been good banking good good

2580
01:55:49,090 --> 01:55:52,329
banker you know banking partners or

2581
01:55:50,859 --> 01:55:54,519
whatever they just let him roll and they

2582
01:55:52,329 --> 01:55:57,640
decided that sort of Berkeley patients

2583
01:55:54,520 --> 01:56:00,640
group and some local vise shops you know

2584
01:55:57,640 --> 01:56:02,710
like were still they were still letting

2585
01:56:00,640 --> 01:56:04,960
us roll but of course shortly after that

2586
01:56:02,710 --> 01:56:14,890
uh we did find out that our bank was

2587
01:56:04,960 --> 01:56:17,590
being took all the money and booked in

2588
01:56:14,890 --> 01:56:19,450
our account negative nine hundred ninety

2589
01:56:17,590 --> 01:56:21,220
nine million nine hundred ninety nine

2590
01:56:19,449 --> 01:56:23,380
thousand nine hundred ninety nine

2591
01:56:21,220 --> 01:56:25,710
dollars me and Etienne were negative

2592
01:56:23,380 --> 01:56:28,720
billionaires there for a moment in time

2593
01:56:25,710 --> 01:56:32,079
that's when they DEA sees that when I do

2594
01:56:28,720 --> 01:56:33,340
an IRC cpg got destroyed in two thousand

2595
01:56:32,079 --> 01:56:35,559
seven yeah

2596
01:56:33,340 --> 01:56:37,090
Don actually went down to the bank while

2597
01:56:35,560 --> 01:56:39,490
they were seizing the account and took

2598
01:56:37,090 --> 01:56:42,430
all the money out of the bank account by

2599
01:56:39,489 --> 01:56:44,079
the time the lien got on the DEA [ __ ]

2600
01:56:42,430 --> 01:56:47,020
you not and that's proof right there

2601
01:56:44,079 --> 01:56:48,630
that there there's an agenda like deeply

2602
01:56:47,020 --> 01:56:50,280
deeply disturbing agenda

2603
01:56:48,630 --> 01:56:51,869
against cannabis to the point where they

2604
01:56:50,279 --> 01:56:54,569
would never do that even to a money

2605
01:56:51,869 --> 01:56:56,639
launderer to it to a massive drug lord

2606
01:56:54,569 --> 01:56:59,219
like the same thing with like when they

2607
01:56:56,639 --> 01:57:01,710
arrested Marc Emery and it was like the

2608
01:56:59,219 --> 01:57:05,130
the number of pounds they said that his

2609
01:57:01,710 --> 01:57:06,719
cannabis seeds grew was exactly the

2610
01:57:05,130 --> 01:57:09,539
number that allowed you to charge

2611
01:57:06,719 --> 01:57:12,929
someone with the kingpin law which was

2612
01:57:09,539 --> 01:57:15,300
like the death penalty which was pretty

2613
01:57:12,929 --> 01:57:17,010
intense up here when he was just like.he

2614
01:57:15,300 --> 01:57:18,810
people were like oh you can't go down

2615
01:57:17,010 --> 01:57:20,550
there like they might kill you and he

2616
01:57:18,810 --> 01:57:24,840
was just like no no I'm going I'm going

2617
01:57:20,550 --> 01:57:26,340
I can't run away from this sounds like

2618
01:57:24,840 --> 01:57:30,150
kind of like the thing you run away from

2619
01:57:26,340 --> 01:57:33,420
life like be having your life threatened

2620
01:57:30,149 --> 01:57:35,839
seems like no they try to do that to our

2621
01:57:33,420 --> 01:57:39,329
friend ed Rosenthal and if I remember

2622
01:57:35,840 --> 01:57:41,880
Debbie and I a week we were the two of

2623
01:57:39,329 --> 01:57:43,829
the recalcitrant seven because we knew

2624
01:57:41,880 --> 01:57:46,560
that we could only give the fifth and

2625
01:57:43,829 --> 01:57:50,189
tenth amendment before the federal court

2626
01:57:46,560 --> 01:57:52,710
because if they if anybody said yes he

2627
01:57:50,189 --> 01:57:55,289
was the boss they were gonna put kingpin

2628
01:57:52,710 --> 01:57:57,869
charges on Edie and it was life in jail

2629
01:57:55,289 --> 01:57:59,969
so it wasn't a death sentence per se but

2630
01:57:57,869 --> 01:58:03,029
it was a death sentence that I would

2631
01:57:59,969 --> 01:58:05,760
never see my friend again so thankfully

2632
01:58:03,029 --> 01:58:07,380
all of us yeah we all went to first it

2633
01:58:05,760 --> 01:58:10,380
was a grand jury we had to go through

2634
01:58:07,380 --> 01:58:12,690
then it was the actual federal we had

2635
01:58:10,380 --> 01:58:14,929
you had to go up before the actual judge

2636
01:58:12,689 --> 01:58:17,759
declare a fifth tenth amendment and

2637
01:58:14,929 --> 01:58:19,889
fortunately we were held in contempt and

2638
01:58:17,760 --> 01:58:21,659
they let us go home it was weird

2639
01:58:19,889 --> 01:58:23,969
they'd never been booked it on our

2640
01:58:21,658 --> 01:58:26,309
records Etienne they didn't book on it

2641
01:58:23,969 --> 01:58:28,380
in Bochum they actually when we refused

2642
01:58:26,310 --> 01:58:29,909
to testify against Edie Rosenthal they

2643
01:58:28,380 --> 01:58:33,210
put all of us on trial

2644
01:58:29,908 --> 01:58:35,039
Ian Etienne got put on trial for a civil

2645
01:58:33,210 --> 01:58:38,310
and criminal contempt of court for

2646
01:58:35,039 --> 01:58:47,130
refusing to testify holy [ __ ] you guys

2647

2650
01:58:50,939 --> 01:58:54,839
realize they're Atlanta's make little

2651
01:58:52,260 --> 01:58:57,300
speeches it was judge Breyer so our

2652
01:58:54,840 --> 01:58:59,520
speeches were all like what we're doing

2653
01:58:57,300 --> 01:59:01,590
is right we're supporting the will of

2654
01:58:59,520 --> 01:59:02,219
the people we don't understand why the

2655
01:59:01,590 --> 01:59:03,690
government

2656
01:59:02,219 --> 01:59:06,840
as us here the government's actually

2657
01:59:03,689 --> 01:59:08,939
wrong in this case and one by one we got

2658
01:59:06,840 --> 01:59:11,690
up and said that it was so cool the

2659
01:59:08,939 --> 01:59:13,919
judge was like he gave a speech about us

2660
01:59:11,689 --> 01:59:16,198
he said something like when people look

2661
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:18,270
at this case and they should they'll see

2662
01:59:16,198 --> 01:59:20,279
how you can bring strongly held views

2663
01:59:18,270 --> 01:59:24,239
into the federal court in a dignified

2664
01:59:20,279 --> 01:59:28,170
manner that gets them heard and and then

2665
01:59:24,238 --> 01:59:32,459
he said if if you guys are guilty of

2666
01:59:28,170 --> 01:59:34,739
civil contempt of court if going to jail

2667
01:59:32,460 --> 01:59:36,930
will make you testify against Edie I'm

2668
01:59:34,738 --> 01:59:39,419

2673
01:59:47,909 --> 01:59:51,539
what we're not going to testify in the

2674
01:59:49,350 --> 01:59:53,310
end and judge Breyer sent us home and

2675
01:59:51,539 --> 01:59:55,050
even though he found us guilty he never

2676
01:59:53,310 --> 01:59:59,250
booked it on a record so it was really

2677

jar to cure seems like the longer it

2730
02:02:07,250 --> 02:02:17,329
stays in the jar the more oily and

2731
02:02:08,989 --> 02:02:18,979
better it smells yes and yes and yes so

2732
02:02:17,329 --> 02:02:21,439
many people like I always ask people

2733
02:02:18,979 --> 02:02:23,179
well do you understand what cure it is

2734
02:02:21,439 --> 02:02:24,979
cuz cure it isn't like when you make

2735
02:02:23,180 --> 02:02:27,020
your hash and it's all brand new like

2736
02:02:24,979 --> 02:02:28,909
that's preserved do you want to preserve

2737
02:02:27,020 --> 02:02:31,160
your hash and put it and put it in a

2738
02:02:28,909 --> 02:02:32,689
freezer or a fridge do you want to cure

2739
02:02:31,159 --> 02:02:36,260
your hash well that's a little different

2740
02:02:32,689 --> 02:02:38,809
that involves Turk burping and you know

2741
02:02:36,260 --> 02:02:42,470
aging your hash in different varieties

2742
02:02:38,810 --> 02:02:45,620
of containers and temperatures and

2743
02:02:42,470 --> 02:02:47,449
places so it all kind of turns out weird

2744
02:02:45,619 --> 02:02:49,519
and different that's for sure my oldest

2745
02:02:47,449 --> 02:02:54,829
is is gonna be 10 years old this year

2746
02:02:49,520 --> 02:02:57,830
oh I've tasted that so it tastes like

2747
02:02:54,829 --> 02:03:01,609
crazy no does this not taste crazy yes

2748
02:02:57,829 --> 02:03:04,579
yes like hurt Hume and just rips your

2749
02:03:01,609 --> 02:03:07,309
[ __ ] head right off it's so wasn't

2750
02:03:04,579 --> 02:03:10,189
traditional Afghani buried for two years

2751
02:03:07,310 --> 02:03:12,920
and then actually pressed after it was

2752
02:03:10,189 --> 02:03:16,099
saved I guess me Sam might know this

2753
02:03:12,920 --> 02:03:19,730
damn it's like what they were really

2754
02:03:16,100 --> 02:03:22,400
trying to age it to be honest what they

2755
02:03:19,729 --> 02:03:25,828
were doing was just waiting for somebody

2756
02:03:22,399 --> 02:03:28,379
to buy it look at the color of that [ __ ]

2757
02:03:25,828 --> 02:03:29,578
but they were just storing bangumi they

2758
02:03:28,380 --> 02:03:33,270
were just storing it in the bank of the

2759
02:03:29,578 --> 02:03:38,250
earth and until buyer came around oh you

2760
02:03:33,270 --> 02:03:47,030
guys this strawberry banana cush I guess

2761
02:03:38,250 --> 02:03:47,029
it is last one then this one here pepper

2762
02:03:53,739 --> 02:03:58,000
[Laughter]

2763
02:04:02,960 --> 02:04:10,408
Marcus yeah I got some cool seeds from

2764
02:04:07,559 --> 02:04:12,389
Great Lakes Greece friends over there I

2765
02:04:10,408 --> 02:04:15,359
got some all kinds of different

2766
02:04:12,389 --> 02:04:18,420
watermelons and heirloom tomatoes which

2767
02:04:15,359 --> 02:04:21,420
is another hobby of mine so that's a

2768
02:04:18,420 --> 02:04:24,090
beautiful seed trade from Andy over

2769
02:04:21,420 --> 02:04:27,149
there just just few days ago and all

2770
02:04:24,090 --> 02:04:29,969
kinds of unique greens and brassicas so

2771
02:04:27,149 --> 02:04:32,339
we did kind of a northern latitude or

2772
02:04:29,969 --> 02:04:34,889
northern region trade for pipes that

2773
02:04:32,340 --> 02:04:44,010
he's saved by feed-in his own varieties

2774
02:04:34,889 --> 02:04:46,440
nice tomato what did you bet like much

2775
02:04:44,010 --> 02:04:49,050
my favorite out here I don't grow I grow

2776
02:04:46,439 --> 02:04:50,789
sun-grown no cover tomato heirloom here

2777
02:04:49,050 --> 02:04:54,000
so I have to have adapted or ones that

2778
02:04:50,789 --> 02:04:56,789
do well I try out about 50 plus righties

2779
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:59,069
each year but the pineapple slicer a

2780
02:04:56,789 --> 02:05:01,670
West out in Northern California was my

2781
02:04:59,069 --> 02:05:05,308
favorite I haven't tried out your yet

2782
02:05:01,670 --> 02:05:07,739
Cherokee purple and Brandywine those are

2783
02:05:05,309 --> 02:05:11,610
the two liter blue beautiful I love

2784
02:05:07,738 --> 02:05:14,789
those you crude those in your greenhouse

2785
02:05:11,609 --> 02:05:18,389
didn't you Sam absolutely

2786
02:05:14,789 --> 02:05:21,000
we would get easily more than 100 kilos

2787
02:05:18,389 --> 02:05:23,340
every year we got a single a dose of

2788
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:25,529
Brandywine that were more than one kilo

2789
02:05:23,340 --> 02:05:28,170
did you pull a lot of tomatoes off your

2790
02:05:25,529 --> 02:05:30,559
wall in your living room there in your

2791
02:05:28,170 --> 02:05:30,559
window

2792
02:05:30,979 --> 02:05:37,279
oh yes we also grew but the the

2793
02:05:34,909 --> 02:05:38,359
container the little 10 meter pots worth

2794
02:05:37,279 --> 02:05:42,469
of in your window

2795
02:05:38,359 --> 02:05:45,559
they don't yield certainly no I've even

2796
02:05:42,470 --> 02:05:48,380
had 20 liters on the floor with all the

2797
02:05:45,560 --> 02:05:50,240
fruit coming over to the to the window

2798
02:05:48,380 --> 02:05:51,710
dude I'll still say your tomato vine

2799
02:05:50,239 --> 02:05:53,960
that was in your window in your

2800
02:05:51,710 --> 02:05:56,060
apartment in Amsterdam was nicer than

2801
02:05:53,960 --> 02:05:59,840
like most of the tomato plants I've seen

2802
02:05:56,060 --> 02:06:03,680
people grow in their gardens well we

2803
02:05:59,840 --> 02:06:07,579
love tomatoes and Dutch tomatoes are the

2804
02:06:03,680 --> 02:06:10,909
worst of the world so you the other find

2805
02:06:07,579 --> 02:06:12,859
some solution and heirloom tomatoes is

2806
02:06:10,909 --> 02:06:14,989
the way to go that's tomatoes are the

2807
02:06:12,859 --> 02:06:21,349
equivalent of iceberg lettuce is that

2808
02:06:14,989 --> 02:06:25,279
what you're saying no Dutch tomatoes

2809
02:06:21,350 --> 02:06:26,180
just I mean they have no smell very

2810
02:06:25,279 --> 02:06:29,689
little taste

2811
02:06:26,180 --> 02:06:32,150
they look red from the day you buy them

2812
02:06:29,689 --> 02:06:36,649
to the when you throw them away they

2813
02:06:32,149 --> 02:06:38,299
look like a tomato but they ate looks

2814
02:06:36,649 --> 02:06:43,969
like a-alice has got a messy collection

2815
02:06:38,300 --> 02:06:47,989
going because these two rides 2pj

2816
02:06:43,970 --> 02:06:48,890
tomatoes so if there's anyone in

2817
02:06:47,989 --> 02:06:51,079
Northern California

2818
02:06:48,890 --> 02:06:52,640
I would seats I can't reseeds because I

2819
02:06:51,079 --> 02:06:54,350
don't have seeds it but I would collect

2820
02:06:52,640 --> 02:06:57,740
the in the end of the year but I'll

2821
02:06:54,350 --> 02:06:59,930
trade donations of seeds I'll go grab it

2822
02:06:57,739 --> 02:07:04,149
after I'm quarantined of Spain you know

2823
02:06:59,930 --> 02:07:04,150
just to make sure you guys are all safe

2824
02:07:04,630 --> 02:07:14,539
I am now I am in Sebastopol like Santa

2825
02:07:09,079 --> 02:07:16,100
Rosa area there's a real easy one I

2826
02:07:14,539 --> 02:07:19,819
don't know if they're still doing it the

2827
02:07:16,100 --> 02:07:23,600
in Sonoma County there's a group the

2828
02:07:19,819 --> 02:07:25,369
Sonoma Valley cannabis enthusiast or

2829
02:07:23,600 --> 02:07:27,860
something like that that has been doing

2830
02:07:25,369 --> 02:07:30,680
for a couple of years regular meetings

2831
02:07:27,859 --> 02:07:32,589
every Tuesday I think and they're

2832
02:07:30,680 --> 02:07:36,920
teaching people how to grow they have a

2833
02:07:32,590 --> 02:07:39,260
campaign called grow six big ones which

2834
02:07:36,920 --> 02:07:41,149
in the you know in the California scheme

2835
02:07:39,260 --> 02:07:44,090
you can grow you grow six plants

2836
02:07:41,149 --> 02:07:45,829
for your personal use yeah and yeah

2837
02:07:44,090 --> 02:07:49,250
their whole thing was grow six big ones

2838
02:07:45,829 --> 02:07:52,069
outdoors and they're given away a lot of

2839
02:07:49,250 --> 02:07:57,279
seeds over there but with the quarantine

2840
02:07:52,069 --> 02:07:59,689
thing might be easiest if you could just

2841
02:07:57,279 --> 02:08:01,880
reach out to me and I can send you some

2842
02:07:59,689 --> 02:08:03,199
of the things I got sitting here because

2843
02:08:01,880 --> 02:08:06,020
I have way more seeds than I'm ever

2844
02:08:03,199 --> 02:08:09,439
going to sprout and they'd be mostly CBD

2845
02:08:06,020 --> 02:08:13,820
and THC things together CBD and stuff

2846
02:08:09,439 --> 02:08:15,619
helps but I want also veggies oh yeah I

filled with all these other seeds that

2879

around his cannabis plants in his area

2881

out I was like dude now we always do

2889
02:10:04,960 --> 02:10:09,220
that that's kind of like we give up big

2890
02:10:07,090 --> 02:10:10,900
fat bags of seeds and everybody's really

2891
02:10:09,220 --> 02:10:14,730
stoked I'm saying you know you'll find

2892
02:10:10,899 --> 02:10:14,729
the cannabis seeds intermixed in there

2893
02:10:16,109 --> 02:10:23,109
got a search form also say to for people

2894
02:10:20,649 --> 02:10:27,009
to look up peace seedlings and peace

2895
02:10:23,109 --> 02:10:28,779
seeds online they're out of Corvallis

2896
02:10:27,010 --> 02:10:32,289
Oregon but we've walked their gardens

2897
02:10:28,779 --> 02:10:34,659
before and Alan Cap Euler is the the man

2898
02:10:32,289 --> 02:10:36,909
who runs it but his kids run the Peace

2899
02:10:34,659 --> 02:10:39,189
seedling art so both of them sell seeds

2900
02:10:36,909 --> 02:10:42,189
but they grew two hundred varieties of

2901
02:10:39,189 --> 02:10:44,139
tomatoes on their property and Alan has

2902
02:10:42,189 --> 02:10:44,469
been breeding tomatoes for his whole

2903
02:10:44,140 --> 02:10:47,200
life

2904
02:10:44,470 --> 02:10:50,140
so there's other dult life yeah a lot of

2905
02:10:47,199 --> 02:10:53,439
the reasons why delicious Tomatoes have

2906
02:10:50,140 --> 02:10:55,000
hit market is because of Alan and really

2907
02:10:53,439 --> 02:10:59,469
cool to check out his varietals

2908
02:10:55,000 --> 02:11:02,409
beautiful flower I originally got my

2909
02:10:59,470 --> 02:11:05,230
tomato seeds from the Seed Savers

2910
02:11:02,409 --> 02:11:07,840
Exchange I'm not sure if you're familiar

2911
02:11:05,229 --> 02:11:09,849
with that group but it was started by

2912
02:11:07,840 --> 02:11:16,569
Kent Wheatley years ago I've been a

2913
02:11:09,850 --> 02:11:19,960
lifetime member for 40 35 40 years so I

2914
02:11:16,569 --> 02:11:27,189
imagine you have some good seeds well

2915
02:11:19,960 --> 02:11:33,819
I've grown a few that oil of oregano oil

2916
02:11:27,189 --> 02:11:37,389
went down the wrong pipe dr. Alec a

2917
02:11:33,819 --> 02:11:39,340
pillar he grows wild garden seeds we've

2918
02:11:37,390 --> 02:11:41,380
been buying their varieties for years he

2919
02:11:39,340 --> 02:11:44,949
does great greens he does an amazing

2920
02:11:41,380 --> 02:11:47,680
rainbow kale which is a red Russian

2921
02:11:44,949 --> 02:11:49,779
cross with the lacinato that's our top

2922
02:11:47,680 --> 02:11:52,539
favorite has a lot of purple in it and

2923
02:11:49,779 --> 02:11:54,729
also dog tipping down at us seven seeds

2924
02:11:52,539 --> 02:11:57,279
in Williams Oregon he does an amazing

2925
02:11:54,729 --> 02:11:58,839
job too we took some breeding classes

2926
02:11:57,279 --> 02:12:01,659
down there with me and my wife lived in

2927
02:11:58,840 --> 02:12:03,640
in Williams in the early 2000 those guys

2928
02:12:01,659 --> 02:12:05,908
all have great good quality seeds down

2929
02:12:03,640 --> 02:12:08,949
there and I highly recommended

2930
02:12:05,908 --> 02:12:09,519
unbelievable oh thanks for the share Tom

2931
02:12:08,948 --> 02:12:11,678
that's great

2932
02:12:09,520 --> 02:12:14,290
I you know all this talk of heirloom

2933
02:12:11,679 --> 02:12:16,029
tomatoes when I had my gallery the

2934
02:12:14,289 --> 02:12:17,618
melting point gallery and I decided hey

2935
02:12:16,029 --> 02:12:19,300
you know like I wanted to build this

2936
02:12:17,618 --> 02:12:21,460
beautiful gallery with this beautiful

2937
02:12:19,300 --> 02:12:23,050
vapor lounge where you know something

2938
02:12:21,460 --> 02:12:24,609
that I just hadn't seen in the cannabis

2939
02:12:23,050 --> 02:12:27,190
space where it was like let's build

2940
02:12:24,609 --> 02:12:28,899
something really beautiful and and no

2941
02:12:27,189 --> 02:12:30,519
one even believed it was a cannabis

2942
02:12:28,899 --> 02:12:32,078
lounge when they would come in I thought

2943
02:12:30,520 --> 02:12:33,550
it was like a jewelry store or something

2944
02:12:32,078 --> 02:12:36,299
because I put these beautiful hardwood

2945
02:12:33,550 --> 02:12:44,739
floors and these cherry wood floors and

2946
02:12:36,300 --> 02:12:47,590
Japanese cherry seeds that we here's

2947
02:12:44,738 --> 02:12:49,808
some these are straw flowers this is

2948
02:12:47,590 --> 02:12:52,059
just a huge tote we have like three

2949
02:12:49,809 --> 02:12:55,529
totes of just pollinate some stuff that

2950
02:12:52,059 --> 02:12:58,090
we garden seeds just pollinators

2951
02:12:55,529 --> 02:13:01,658
intermix with all of your cannabis and

2952
02:12:58,090 --> 02:13:06,639
all of your fruit and your veggies that

2953
02:13:01,658 --> 02:13:10,089
are sweet or all marigolds this is all

2954
02:13:06,639 --> 02:13:13,118
what we gathered from last year so we're

2955
02:13:10,090 --> 02:13:14,828
gonna have you know basically our whole

2956
02:13:13,118 --> 02:13:18,848
entire property is going to come alive

2957
02:13:14,828 --> 02:13:21,939
with flowers petals everything it's so

2958
02:13:18,849 --> 02:13:24,520
incredibly healthy when we're planting

2959
02:13:21,939 --> 02:13:26,859
pollinators and it's beautiful - we were

2960
02:13:24,520 --> 02:13:29,199
getting species of birds even this

2961
02:13:26,859 --> 02:13:31,479
spring so we'd never seen before

2962
02:13:29,198 --> 02:13:33,399
well that we just saw last year that

2963
02:13:31,479 --> 02:13:35,408
seemed to come into our farm in the

2964
02:13:33,399 --> 02:13:37,029
summer and we're just wondering if they

2965
02:13:35,408 --> 02:13:39,729
sort of told each other where to come

2966
02:13:37,029 --> 02:13:42,670
back to and already we're starting to

2967
02:13:39,729 --> 02:13:44,919
see insects so I just want to remind

2968
02:13:42,670 --> 02:13:47,980
everyone part of growing a garden is to

2969
02:13:44,920 --> 02:13:55,449
save the seeds so the garden is the

2970
02:13:47,979 --> 02:13:58,799
source of the seeds for next year yep so

2971
02:13:55,448 --> 02:14:01,299
you're acclimating your own seeds yes

2972
02:13:58,800 --> 02:14:03,190
you'll really see a difference after one

2973
02:14:01,300 --> 02:14:07,320
year of growing seeds on your property

2974
02:14:03,189 --> 02:14:10,899
and saving a buck next reel will see a

2975
02:14:07,319 --> 02:14:14,198
noticeable difference and also if you

2976
02:14:10,899 --> 02:14:16,328
plant the seed in the soil that is on

2977
02:14:14,198 --> 02:14:17,828
your land the seed is going to be

2978
02:14:16,328 --> 02:14:19,920
stronger the plant is going to be

2979
02:14:17,828 --> 02:14:22,799
stronger and you

2980
02:14:19,920 --> 02:14:24,569
it'll it'll recognize if it can climate

2981
02:14:22,800 --> 02:14:27,750
eyes to your area once it does and it

2982
02:14:24,569 --> 02:14:29,309
will build the bacteria and the fungi

2983
02:14:27,750 --> 02:14:31,289
within the cells in order for it to

2984
02:14:29,310 --> 02:14:35,010
really thrive and provide its medicine

2985
02:14:31,289 --> 02:14:36,960
so right now we're being able to benefit

2986
02:14:35,010 --> 02:14:39,060
from a winter's worth of soil building

2987
02:14:36,960 --> 02:14:42,118
now all the scenes are just gonna just

2988
02:14:39,060 --> 02:14:44,369
dig into the soil and create medicine

2989
02:14:42,118 --> 02:14:47,908
because the seeds actually have the

2990
02:14:44,368 --> 02:14:50,519
microbiome of the soil that it came from

2991
02:14:47,908 --> 02:14:53,549
and then when it continues to update

2992
02:14:50,520 --> 02:14:55,590
that same microbiome which is the end of

2993
02:14:53,550 --> 02:14:57,750
FIDIC system which is the bucket

2994
02:14:55,590 --> 02:15:01,289
you know the microbiome of inside of the

2995
02:14:57,750 --> 02:15:03,840
plant and just like human beings acumen

2996
02:15:01,289 --> 02:15:06,269
acclimates to the same zone you know we

2997
02:15:03,840 --> 02:15:08,639
we talked a lot about the microbiome of

2998
02:15:06,270 --> 02:15:10,889
the human being but it's also important

2999
02:15:08,639 --> 02:15:12,569
to start bringing up the conversation of

3000
02:15:10,889 --> 02:15:16,529
the microbiome of the plant because it

3001
02:15:12,569 --> 02:15:19,559
also has bacteria and fungi that digests

3002
02:15:16,529 --> 02:15:21,420
and helps bring up nutrition so it's

3003
02:15:19,560 --> 02:15:26,039
it's sort of cool to think a battery for

3004
02:15:21,420 --> 02:15:29,550
for acclamation there's a two kilo bag

3005
02:15:26,039 --> 02:15:32,300
of seeds so this has got a hundred

3006
02:15:29,550 --> 02:15:39,060
thousand seeds in it and i've got

3007
02:15:32,300 --> 02:15:41,159
hundreds of bags like this also today is

3008
02:15:39,060 --> 02:15:45,000
a Pisces moon it's a really beautiful

3009
02:15:41,158 --> 02:15:47,939
time it's the new moon phase in Pisces

3010
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:50,158
it's a really beautiful time all day

3011
02:15:47,939 --> 02:15:52,769
today and tonight you just plant as many

3012
02:15:50,158 --> 02:15:55,469
seeds as you can even your microgreens

3013
02:15:52,770 --> 02:15:56,969
or your sprouts for your kitchen they'll

3014
02:15:55,469 --> 02:15:59,118
be really vigorous if you plant them

3015
02:15:56,969 --> 02:16:02,520
today

3016
02:15:59,118 --> 02:16:06,509
get them crack and crack a lacking Wow

3017
02:16:02,520 --> 02:16:08,550
we've been rocking this for what that's

3018
02:16:06,510 --> 02:16:11,369
pretty good went by quick today I didn't

3019
02:16:08,550 --> 02:16:14,850
have to deal with the live thing it's

3020
02:16:11,368 --> 02:16:16,738
kind of nice to to do the show not live

3021
02:16:14,850 --> 02:16:18,570
even though I know a lot of people are

3022
02:16:16,738 --> 02:16:20,368
kind of bummed out because it's nice to

3023
02:16:18,569 --> 02:16:23,429
have them as well the audience and being

3024
02:16:20,368 --> 02:16:25,109
able to somehow help the conversation

3025
02:16:23,429 --> 02:16:26,730
along you know often they'll be able to

3026
02:16:25,109 --> 02:16:29,759
ask questions and lead the conversation

3027
02:16:26,729 --> 02:16:32,129
but that was not the case today so it is

3028
02:16:29,760 --> 02:16:33,620
what it is lots of seeds I know where

3029
02:16:32,129 --> 02:16:35,359
I'm going to get my seeds if I need

3030
02:16:33,620 --> 02:16:38,660
any seeds just gonna be sending a couple

3031
02:16:35,360 --> 02:16:40,370
of private messages when you reload this

3032
02:16:38,659 --> 02:16:41,718
dude as a premier and then people can

3033
02:16:40,370 --> 02:16:44,030
talk and they're as they're in-house

3034
02:16:41,718 --> 02:16:45,919
Church as it's going that's how I knew

3035
02:16:44,030 --> 02:16:47,090
some of my videos oh yeah scheduler

3036
02:16:45,920 --> 02:16:48,200
those are premier and then people can

3037
02:16:47,090 --> 02:16:51,049
talk all the way through it for the

3038
02:16:48,200 --> 02:16:52,400
couple hour we won't be able to talk to

3039
02:16:51,049 --> 02:16:53,840
us but they can talk to each other

3040
02:16:52,399 --> 02:16:55,369
need to talk to each other and you can

3041

germ plasm Institute for North America

3047
02:17:06,290 --> 02:17:10,700
for our cannabis genetics so that they

3048
02:17:08,329 --> 02:17:13,940
can be acclimated so that there are

3049
02:17:10,700 --> 02:17:16,820
regional groves that are around the US

3050
02:17:13,940 --> 02:17:19,670
and Canada that are growing on certain

3051
02:17:16,819 --> 02:17:22,250
longitudes and latitudes because when I

3052
02:17:19,670 --> 02:17:24,799
used to order my hemp back in Hungary

3053
02:17:22,250 --> 02:17:27,530
and Romania I was actually knew exactly

3054
02:17:24,799 --> 02:17:29,959
what the output of this compote a seed

3055
02:17:27,530 --> 02:17:31,540
exactly what we were growing had because

3056
02:17:29,959 --> 02:17:33,529
they were actually grown and proper

3057
02:17:31,540 --> 02:17:37,130
Institute's that were properly

3058
02:17:33,530 --> 02:17:38,929
acclimating it so I could maximize you

3059
02:17:37,129 --> 02:17:41,539
know the fiber that I was trying to get

3060
02:17:38,929 --> 02:17:43,429
out of the actual Hector's okay that's

3061
02:17:41,540 --> 02:17:45,980
real projections that I needed to have

3062
02:17:43,429 --> 02:17:48,710
and if you don't have proper acclimated

3063
02:17:45,979 --> 02:17:50,299
seeds right out the gate you're not

3064
02:17:48,709 --> 02:17:52,579
gonna get the reality that you're

3065
02:17:50,299 --> 02:17:54,829
searching for you know and that's a

3066
02:17:52,579 --> 02:17:56,329
reality that is different from what

3067
02:17:54,829 --> 02:17:59,030
we're doing here in America because we

3068
02:17:56,329 --> 02:18:01,670
were growing 300 to 400 seed per square

3069
02:17:59,030 --> 02:18:05,230
meter which is not how we're doing it

3070
02:18:01,670 --> 02:18:07,940
here because we have the machinery in

3071
02:18:05,229 --> 02:18:10,159
Eastern Europe to break that hamp down

3072
02:18:07,940 --> 02:18:13,219
where we have absolutely none of that

3073
02:18:10,159 --> 02:18:16,010
infrastructure or large-scale dunking

3074
02:18:13,218 --> 02:18:19,849
tat you know tanks for you know reading

3075
02:18:16,010 --> 02:18:21,620
the hemp etc etc so I'm very fascinated

3076
02:18:19,850 --> 02:18:24,380
to see as the hemp industry grows

3077
02:18:21,620 --> 02:18:26,450
throughout North America actual

3078
02:18:24,379 --> 02:18:29,269
investment in the infrastructure that

3079
02:18:26,450 --> 02:18:31,490
will be needed but on top of that germ

3080
02:18:29,270 --> 02:18:34,790
plasm Institute needs to be there just

3081
02:18:31,489 --> 02:18:36,770
for the start of this before any of that

3082
02:18:34,790 --> 02:18:38,900
can really take off so people can have

3083
02:18:36,770 --> 02:18:43,489
good steady supply because we're gonna

3084
02:18:38,899 --> 02:18:45,468
see cross pollenization ruins te crops

3085
02:18:43,489 --> 02:18:47,539
because it's going to increase THC and a

3086
02:18:45,468 --> 02:18:49,459
half that's just the reality

3087
02:18:47,540 --> 02:18:52,040
what we're gonna see as well as we're

3088
02:18:49,459 --> 02:18:54,250
gonna see the reverse and you know

3089
02:18:52,040 --> 02:18:57,139
people growing outdoors for you know

3090
02:18:54,250 --> 02:18:59,840
cannabis for their smoking so these are

3091
02:18:57,138 --> 02:19:02,659
real realities we have to you know look

3092
02:18:59,840 --> 02:19:04,398
at and face and I understand why a lot

3093
02:19:02,659 --> 02:19:06,679
of people are going towards CBD because

3094
02:19:04,398 --> 02:19:08,599
it's easier to just you know shake the

3095
02:19:06,679 --> 02:19:10,489
flowers as opposed to invest in the

3096
02:19:08,599 --> 02:19:13,159
billions of dollars needed for a fiber

3097
02:19:10,489 --> 02:19:15,978
factory to cut nice the hemp to make it

3098
02:19:13,159 --> 02:19:19,010
into a product that could go to a market

3099
02:19:15,978 --> 02:19:20,000
to manufacture a product that consumer

3100
02:19:19,010 --> 02:19:24,859
could get today

3101
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:26,659
that's decades away still sure yeah

3102
02:19:24,859 --> 02:19:29,029
there there's a group I met from

3103
02:19:26,659 --> 02:19:33,648
Saskatchewan I believe and his father

3104
02:19:29,029 --> 02:19:36,260
had invented some technology to it had

3105
02:19:33,648 --> 02:19:38,568
to do with trees and the and and the

3106
02:19:36,260 --> 02:19:40,719
what was inside trees and I can't

3107
02:19:38,568 --> 02:19:43,519
remember if it was the length or the

3108
02:19:40,718 --> 02:19:45,138
percentages or he had this technology

3109
02:19:43,519 --> 02:19:47,719
and then years and he was very

3110
02:19:45,138 --> 02:19:50,929
successful with this technology and then

3111
02:19:47,718 --> 02:19:53,000
years later he attuned it to cannabis to

3112
02:19:50,930 --> 02:19:55,970
hemp for fiber and now they're doing

3113
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:57,439
this big fiber project and I know Martin

3114
02:19:55,969 --> 02:19:59,028
merav chief who was one of the founders

3115
02:19:57,439 --> 02:20:01,729
of manitoba harvest who spent the last

3116
02:19:59,029 --> 02:20:04,760
five years trying to crack the economic

3117
02:20:01,728 --> 02:20:09,769
viability of a fiber production in hemp

3118
02:20:04,760 --> 02:20:11,750
and I know go ahead oh you're muted I I

3119
02:20:09,770 --> 02:20:14,810
could speculate mark on what they're

3120
02:20:11,750 --> 02:20:17,870
doing sure yeah so it's probably just

3121
02:20:14,809 --> 02:20:20,840
having to removing removing the lignin

3122
02:20:17,870 --> 02:20:23,750
efficiently from the cellulose so they

3123
02:20:20,840 --> 02:20:25,370
have to do that in wood in wood there's

3124
02:20:23,750 --> 02:20:29,359
a lot more lignin than there is an

3125
02:20:25,370 --> 02:20:32,720
intent but the same type of process to

3126
02:20:29,359 --> 02:20:33,470
basically pulp you know for not sure

3127
02:20:32,719 --> 02:20:36,139
that's what it is

3128
02:20:33,469 --> 02:20:38,119
it was some of their like tigers no it

3129
02:20:36,139 --> 02:20:40,670
was some type of like x-ray or like

3130
02:20:38,120 --> 02:20:43,430
photograph of the lumber that they could

3131
02:20:40,670 --> 02:20:46,818
he could figure something out and he he

3132
02:20:43,430 --> 02:20:48,979
was tuning it to hemp to figure out to

3133
02:20:46,818 --> 02:20:50,809
grow these fibers that you can't really

3134
02:20:48,978 --> 02:20:53,688
see with the naked eye but when you do

3135
02:20:50,809 --> 02:20:56,449
it with this machine you get an idea of

3136
02:20:53,689 --> 02:20:58,159
of the quality from the data points of

3137
02:20:56,450 --> 02:21:00,529
the photos something like that it

3138
02:20:58,159 --> 02:21:01,250
reminded me much of what the guys from

3139
02:21:00,529 --> 02:21:03,979
Carnegie Mellon

3140
02:21:01,250 --> 02:21:05,988
University were doing the robotics

3141
02:21:03,978 --> 02:21:08,119
division the AI division where they had

3142
02:21:05,988 --> 02:21:09,680
developed that camera to photograph buds

3143
02:21:08,120 --> 02:21:10,939
and they were taking all of these

3144
02:21:09,680 --> 02:21:15,020
different data points and they were

3145
02:21:10,939 --> 02:21:17,960
trying to basically recognize when the

3146
02:21:15,020 --> 02:21:21,050
plant was in peak production of say THC

3147
02:21:17,959 --> 02:21:24,079
like a single molecule

3148
02:21:21,049 --> 02:21:25,670
well how you R it also depends on what

3149
02:21:24,079 --> 02:21:27,859
type of fiber you're gonna come out with

3150
02:21:25,670 --> 02:21:29,750
I mean I remember Gardella has a machine

3151
02:21:27,859 --> 02:21:33,829
that could actually remove the fiber

3152
02:21:29,750 --> 02:21:36,170
from the hamp wet but the problem is

3153
02:21:33,829 --> 02:21:39,079
still the lignin in between so in Europe

3154
02:21:36,170 --> 02:21:43,728
I mean for hungry we would soak the ham

3155
02:21:39,079 --> 02:21:46,370
and these large concrete tubs so that

3156
02:21:43,728 --> 02:21:48,889
the natural biological would eat away

3157
02:21:46,370 --> 02:21:51,319
the lignin and then we would come away

3158
02:21:48,889 --> 02:21:54,260
with a very golden fiber if we laud it

3159
02:21:51,318 --> 02:21:56,659
ready right if we feel dreaded it and

3160
02:21:54,260 --> 02:21:58,579
just let it lay out in the field it

3161
02:21:56,659 --> 02:22:00,709
would turn gray and that's how a lot of

3162
02:21:58,579 --> 02:22:03,648
the Polish hemp was it's just the

3163
02:22:00,709 --> 02:22:06,318
natural by ultraviolet light correct so

3164
02:22:03,648 --> 02:22:07,969
it's just all about what you're trying

3165
02:22:06,318 --> 02:22:10,670
to come out with a final fiber so we

3166
02:22:07,969 --> 02:22:13,129
wanted a light golden so we had to force

3167
02:22:10,670 --> 02:22:16,879
soak it to actually water read it to do

3168
02:22:13,129 --> 02:22:19,278
that whereas you know that if ruptures

3169
02:22:16,879 --> 02:22:22,309
there and they can actually keep it and

3170
02:22:19,279 --> 02:22:26,300
do it currently Hungarian breeders also

3171
02:22:22,309 --> 02:22:31,129
bred varieties of hemp which had much

3172
02:22:26,299 --> 02:22:32,988
more golden fiber correct we'll have to

3173
02:22:31,129 --> 02:22:35,148
get Robin a mirror on here one day

3174
02:22:32,988 --> 02:22:39,159
they've got their hemp boutique company

3175
02:22:35,148 --> 02:22:42,689
they've done a little doctor well I live

3176
02:22:39,159 --> 02:22:46,229
I've lived in hungry off and on I was

3177
02:22:42,690 --> 02:22:49,840
deeply involved with the couple T

3178
02:22:46,229 --> 02:22:53,229
Research Station which is where Compal

3179
02:22:49,840 --> 02:22:55,540
was developed by dr. Ivan bolsa who was

3180
02:22:53,229 --> 02:22:58,239
a good friend of mine I told him I

3181
02:22:55,540 --> 02:23:00,840
taught him how to breathe cannabis he

3182
02:22:58,239 --> 02:23:03,780
taught me how to breathe industrial hemp

3183
02:23:00,840 --> 02:23:06,430
surprisingly that doesn't surprise me

3184
02:23:03,780 --> 02:23:09,190
yeah because that's what we use the cold

3185
02:23:06,430 --> 02:23:12,010
a genetic and because of the golden as

3186
02:23:09,190 --> 02:23:13,750
well as its availability after we water

3187
02:23:12,010 --> 02:23:17,530
edit it to still maintain through they

3188
02:23:13,750 --> 02:23:20,500
know it was a great crop and yeah loved

3189
02:23:17,530 --> 02:23:25,659
it he was the world's foremost temp

3190
02:23:20,500 --> 02:23:27,790
reader until he died in 97 did you know

3191
02:23:25,659 --> 02:23:32,890
go to Morocco from the Institute of bast

3192
02:23:27,790 --> 02:23:36,311
fibres Sam what was he in Yugoslavia he

3193
02:23:32,890 --> 02:23:39,819
was in the Ukraine in Kiev oh I was with

3194
02:23:36,310 --> 02:23:42,510
Zola - no show guys I met him via

3195
02:23:39,819 --> 02:23:42,510
telephone

3196
02:23:42,540 --> 02:23:48,660
yeah the Vavilov Institute right yeah

3197
02:23:46,450 --> 02:23:48,659
exactly

3198
02:23:50,909 --> 02:23:56,530
we met go to Morocco because we flew him

3199
02:23:53,890 --> 02:23:59,049
from Kiev to Manitoba to our hemp shop

3200
02:23:56,530 --> 02:24:01,601
called the hemp exchange in like 91 or

3201
02:23:59,049 --> 02:24:04,569
92 or something no no sorry it would

3202
02:24:01,601 --> 02:24:07,659
have been 90 no it probably would have

3203
02:24:04,569 --> 02:24:10,149
been that that 94 maybe that sounds

3204
02:24:07,659 --> 02:24:12,430
right and we brought he brought a couple

3205
02:24:10,149 --> 02:24:14,590
of his farmers and they this was the

3206
02:24:12,430 --> 02:24:18,159
beginning of us importing the four tons

3207
02:24:14,590 --> 02:24:21,190
of Zola tanoshii 11 and 13 into Manitoba

3208
02:24:18,159 --> 02:24:25,690
to grow our first experimental Hempfield

3209
02:24:21,190 --> 02:24:30,340
in over 73 years don't want to criticize

3210
02:24:25,690 --> 02:24:35,380
the Ukrainians but they're notorious Lee

3211
02:24:30,340 --> 02:24:38,440
broke oh yeah they couldn't put fuel in

3212
02:24:35,379 --> 02:24:40,959
their tractors they tried to sell me

3213
02:24:38,440 --> 02:24:45,399
hemp until I sent a rad meter and it

3214
02:24:40,959 --> 02:24:47,979
went well we brought seeds over fine and

3215
02:24:45,399 --> 02:24:50,829
it you know it started it kick-started a

3216
02:24:47,979 --> 02:24:52,170
big part of Canada's you know the whole

3217
02:24:50,829 --> 02:24:55,439
grain hemp

3218
02:24:52,170 --> 02:24:57,780
rain you know as a food as a as an oil

3219
02:24:55,439 --> 02:24:59,489
and as a protein powder all of those

3220
02:24:57,780 --> 02:25:02,340
things were really kick-started with

3221
02:24:59,489 --> 02:25:09,709
Zola Genosha 18 wins it was at the

3222
02:25:02,340 --> 02:25:09,710
Chernobyl strained yeah the og Chernobyl

3223
02:25:09,770 --> 02:25:14,520
funny enough that's are too noble that's

3224
02:25:12,659 --> 02:25:16,350
how that's how we found out about hemp

3225
02:25:14,520 --> 02:25:18,329
as a fighter remediated product in

3226
02:25:16,350 --> 02:25:19,620
Canada through those farmers that were

3227
02:25:18,329 --> 02:25:22,770
tobacco farmers and that's how that

3228
02:25:19,620 --> 02:25:25,140
Chernobyl actual in Chernobyl growing

3229
02:25:22,770 --> 02:25:27,210
hemp project got started right but you

3230
02:25:25,139 --> 02:25:30,029
got a wonder markets like did all that

3231
02:25:27,209 --> 02:25:32,849
oil that oil from those plants make it

3232
02:25:30,030 --> 02:25:36,750
into products you know it was

3233
02:25:32,850 --> 02:25:39,059
experimental in 94 95 96 97 Canada

3234
02:25:36,750 --> 02:25:41,549
didn't changed the law till 98 when it

3235
02:25:39,059 --> 02:25:43,769
became commercial and now you could do

3236
02:25:41,549 --> 02:25:45,688
stuff with it before that like there was

3237
02:25:43,770 --> 02:25:47,670
no squeezing seed or there was just

3238
02:25:45,689 --> 02:25:48,899
destruction and so they were tripping

3239
02:25:47,670 --> 02:25:50,819
out because they had to test their

3240
02:25:48,899 --> 02:25:53,129
tobacco field I guess from the

3241
02:25:50,819 --> 02:25:55,439
radium-226 that they spray on tobacco

3242
02:25:53,129 --> 02:25:57,149
which is a radioactive nucleotide and

3243
02:25:55,439 --> 02:26:00,090
does definitely register on one of those

3244
02:25:57,149 --> 02:26:02,520
little Geiger counters their field was

3245
02:26:00,090 --> 02:26:04,228
way too low and they had no idea at

3246
02:26:02,520 --> 02:26:06,479
first that because it was the first time

3247
02:26:04,228 --> 02:26:08,519
they ever grew hemp ever they just I

3248
02:26:06,478 --> 02:26:10,859
don't think could believe that the hemp

3249
02:26:08,520 --> 02:26:12,960
was that fight or remediate of that it

3250
02:26:10,860 --> 02:26:15,390
was that but it could pull that much up

3251
02:26:12,959 --> 02:26:16,769
that would make a large noticeable

3252
02:26:15,389 --> 02:26:18,689
difference you know kind of freaked

3253
02:26:16,770 --> 02:26:21,120
about actually because now they had hemp

3254
02:26:18,689 --> 02:26:24,409
it was like you can't just throw it away

3255
02:26:21,120 --> 02:26:28,110
there's like rules you have to follow

3256
02:26:24,409 --> 02:26:30,450
you heard was Sam I was wondering if you

3257
02:26:28,110 --> 02:26:32,579
have heard of anybody I had heard right

3258
02:26:30,450 --> 02:26:36,450
after Fukushima that they were gonna try

3259
02:26:32,579 --> 02:26:38,389
and do some remediation using in Japan

3260
02:26:36,450 --> 02:26:42,930
have you heard anything regarding that

3261
02:26:38,389 --> 02:26:46,228
no I heard they did it Ukraine but Abner

3262
02:26:42,930 --> 02:26:49,950
Danny think about Japan here here's some

3263
02:26:46,228 --> 02:26:53,849
mutant seeds that are as big as peas

3264
02:26:49,950 --> 02:26:59,040
they're 12 to 1 gram what kind of

3265
02:26:53,850 --> 02:27:01,229
cultivar is that well I'm trying to get

3266
02:26:59,040 --> 02:27:02,970
it in my camera well you're not doing

3267
02:27:01,228 --> 02:27:04,129
very well I'd say pull it back a little

3268
02:27:02,969 --> 02:27:10,698
bit

3269
02:27:04,129 --> 02:27:13,028
there you go those are huge yeah but the

3270
02:27:10,699 --> 02:27:16,369
average seems like that's like seed is

3271
02:27:13,029 --> 02:27:17,569
fifty sixty to one gram these are twelve

3272
02:27:16,369 --> 02:27:20,119
to one gram

3273
02:27:17,568 --> 02:27:21,920
don't you have like the little ones that

3274
02:27:20,119 --> 02:27:22,430
are like a hundred or two hundred or

3275
02:27:21,920 --> 02:27:24,859
something

3276
02:27:22,430 --> 02:27:29,329
no they're eight hundred eight hundred

3277
02:27:24,859 --> 02:27:34,309
those little nepali seeds but not nepali

3278
02:27:29,329 --> 02:27:36,859
that i got them in kashmir make better

3279
02:27:34,309 --> 02:27:39,978
like hemp oil or a better food product

3280
02:27:36,859 --> 02:27:42,079
with the seeds larger do I got better

3281
02:27:39,978 --> 02:27:49,340
cutting small let's can see they're

3282
02:27:42,079 --> 02:27:51,020
never seen in my life cereal every day

3283
02:27:49,340 --> 02:27:54,648
so those would be great those look like

3284
02:27:51,020 --> 02:27:57,140
like peanuts oh yeah the big ones yeah

3285
02:27:54,648 --> 02:28:01,939
you can shell them and then it's like

3286
02:27:57,139 --> 02:28:07,789
opinion of it yeah grow those for a

3287
02:28:01,939 --> 02:28:10,520
product or what's the those TFC PDG i

3288
02:28:07,790 --> 02:28:15,279
bred them for five years I made him

3289
02:28:10,520 --> 02:28:15,279
almost tc3 nice nice

3290
02:28:15,609 --> 02:28:22,340
what's the cannabinoid content of it

3291
02:28:18,318 --> 02:28:26,420
then CBG huh there's a little bit of tea

3292
02:28:22,340 --> 02:28:29,710
CBD and THC B but to be honest what I

3293
02:28:26,420 --> 02:28:32,840
did for five years was I bred all

3294
02:28:29,709 --> 02:28:35,959
cannabinoids away from it because I

3295
02:28:32,840 --> 02:28:38,869
figured if it had the ability to make

3296
02:28:35,959 --> 02:28:42,019
any cannabinoids it might also makes the

3297
02:28:38,869 --> 02:28:44,569
THC even though the papers were

3298
02:28:42,020 --> 02:28:47,689
published until recently that showed

3299
02:28:44,568 --> 02:28:51,920
that most CBD synthesis can produce

3300
02:28:47,689 --> 02:28:55,340
about a twenty five to one ratio of THC

3301
02:28:51,920 --> 02:29:01,699
whether you wanted or not so what about

3302
02:28:55,340 --> 02:29:05,180
the terpene profile a little better dirt

3303
02:29:01,699 --> 02:29:07,220
beans were really really interesting you

3304
02:29:05,180 --> 02:29:10,010
could find individuals that smoke just

3305
02:29:07,219 --> 02:29:14,438
like afghan hash and you could find ones

3306
02:29:10,010 --> 02:29:14,439
it smelled pretty much like Tommy

3307
02:29:16,600 --> 02:29:21,318
yeah some of the type 4 plants have less

3308
02:29:19,579 --> 02:29:23,689
leakage because they don't have a CBD

3309
02:29:21,318 --> 02:29:25,639
synthase gene so that there's still some

3310
02:29:23,689 --> 02:29:27,859
THC but it's usually like a hundred or

3311
02:29:25,639 --> 02:29:29,689
two hundred to one presumably coming

3312
02:29:27,859 --> 02:29:31,068
from the other residual cannabinoid

3313
02:29:29,689 --> 02:29:36,290
genes or so floating around right

3314
02:29:31,068 --> 02:29:39,799
I know CBD does it we didn't understand

3315
02:29:36,290 --> 02:29:43,130
the exact mechanisms when we bred the

3316
02:29:39,799 --> 02:29:46,209
world's first high CBD variety in what

3317
02:29:43,129 --> 02:29:51,608
was that late 90s

3318
02:29:46,209 --> 02:29:56,539
but the end effect is still saying that

3319
02:29:51,609 --> 02:29:58,970
it was coming from someplace and and I

3320
02:29:56,540 --> 02:30:01,760
wouldn't be surprised a few the other

3321
02:29:58,969 --> 02:30:07,789
ones at CDC can also do similar things

3322
02:30:01,760 --> 02:30:11,180
yeah that's with CVG in there or CVG a I

3323
02:30:07,790 --> 02:30:14,000
guess well if you've got a real CBD

3324
02:30:11,180 --> 02:30:20,540
variety you might be able to stop it all

3325
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:24,439
at CVG but easy way is to find a mutant

3326
02:30:20,540 --> 02:30:26,540
for ID that won't even make CBG then the

3327
02:30:24,439 --> 02:30:29,720
entire kinetically trading stock that

3328
02:30:26,540 --> 02:30:32,029
you've got a true melvoy variety there's

3329
02:30:29,719 --> 02:30:39,528
a more economic acid which is the thing

3330
02:30:32,029 --> 02:30:45,229
that makes CVG that's what it is is it's

3331
02:30:39,529 --> 02:30:48,430
the CBD synthase that is not performing

3332
02:30:45,228 --> 02:30:52,488
it's a little like acid cyclase and and

3333
02:30:48,430 --> 02:30:57,699
what else isn't them halfway yeah Tod

3334
02:30:52,488 --> 02:30:59,059
right it's the geraniol altivec acid

3335
02:30:57,699 --> 02:31:05,239
transfer rates

3336
02:30:59,059 --> 02:31:06,559
I think ggot right and mixed around the

3337
02:31:05,238 --> 02:31:07,818
literature I think there's some debate

3338
02:31:06,559 --> 02:31:09,500
over what to call it but yeah some

3339
02:31:07,818 --> 02:31:11,269
people call G ot others I think we're

3340
02:31:09,500 --> 02:31:15,738
calling a live attack low atomic acid

3341
02:31:11,270 --> 02:31:17,449
cyclase but yeah it's a little bit messy

3342
02:31:15,738 --> 02:31:21,500
in there but yeah it glues on that g PP

3343
02:31:17,449 --> 02:31:23,810
on to live at all right right so Sam if

3344
02:31:21,500 --> 02:31:27,859
I'm just wondering it can you back up

3345
02:31:23,809 --> 02:31:29,430
the pathway all the way to that like I

3346
02:31:27,859 --> 02:31:32,248
know that

3347
02:31:29,430 --> 02:31:34,709
I can't believe the varieties that I see

3348
02:31:32,248 --> 02:31:39,478
I saw this one guy who's got a variety

3349
02:31:34,709 --> 02:31:43,680
now that's got 14% CBG there's about

3350
02:31:39,478 --> 02:31:49,010
it's less than a percent of CBD but no

3351
02:31:43,680 --> 02:31:51,959
THC at all none twenty years ago

3352
02:31:49,010 --> 02:31:56,158
the rest of the world has finally caught

3353
02:31:51,959 --> 02:31:59,039
up to you Sam what can we say but so I'm

3354
02:31:56,158 --> 02:32:04,139
wondering can you go can you back it up

3355
02:31:59,039 --> 02:32:08,279
even a step before that so yes deuces no

3356
02:32:04,139 --> 02:32:15,538
CPG yes that does it produce all tava

3357
02:32:08,279 --> 02:32:18,720
Casson and maybe the terpene levels are

3358
02:32:15,539 --> 02:32:20,998
higher I we haven't

3359
02:32:18,719 --> 02:32:22,948
yeah the GPP is competitive in the

3360
02:32:20,998 --> 02:32:25,770
terpene synthase pathway so if you knock

3361
02:32:22,949 --> 02:32:28,619
out the ability to conjugate GPP to a

3362
02:32:25,770 --> 02:32:30,209
limit aaalac acid it's gonna end up

3363
02:32:28,619 --> 02:32:33,209
getting used and shunted over in the

3364
02:32:30,209 --> 02:32:35,279
terpene pathway particularly I think I

3365
02:32:33,209 --> 02:32:37,949
think the monoterpenes are it's it's

3366
02:32:35,279 --> 02:32:39,840
usually I think it's a different

3367
02:32:37,949 --> 02:32:41,340
I think it's fpp on the on the

3368
02:32:39,840 --> 02:32:47,728
sesquiterpene so the monoterpenes are

3369
02:32:41,340 --> 02:32:50,309
all sucking up GTP anyway is there any

3370
02:32:47,728 --> 02:32:53,760
interest in looking at a limit aaalac

3371
02:32:50,309 --> 02:32:56,248
acid as a cannabinoid or not as

3372
02:32:53,760 --> 02:32:58,590
cannabinoid but or I guess all tall

3373
02:32:56,248 --> 02:33:01,498
because it would decarboxylate right

3374
02:32:58,590 --> 02:33:03,959
yeah this is people claim that's uh it's

3375
02:33:01,498 --> 02:33:06,180
kind of a rescue man for too much THC I

3376
02:33:03,959 --> 02:33:07,739
don't know how true it is really yeah if

3377
02:33:06,180 --> 02:33:24,988
you dose people with live at all and

3378
02:33:07,738 --> 02:33:28,918
we'll bring down their high but shorting

3379
02:33:24,988 --> 02:33:30,809
a stock knows what to avoid right he's

3380
02:33:28,918 --> 02:33:33,029
like I've spent my life working in the

3381
02:33:30,809 --> 02:33:41,189
other direction live at all is

3382
02:33:33,029 --> 02:33:43,171
essentially kryptonite for sippy so much

3383
02:33:41,189 --> 02:33:49,130
because they can put

3384
02:33:43,171 --> 02:33:52,560
and modulate the effects of THC and

3385
02:33:49,130 --> 02:33:54,331
that's what I was looking for I'm really

3386
02:33:52,560 --> 02:33:58,229
curious about the friend of yours mark

3387
02:33:54,331 --> 02:34:01,171
that has a CVG plan that has residual

3388
02:33:58,229 --> 02:34:02,399
CBD and such because I haven't said and

3389
02:34:01,171 --> 02:34:05,671
that might have a different genetic

3390
02:34:02,399 --> 02:34:08,011
thing that we learn what we typically

3391
02:34:05,671 --> 02:34:10,110
see is a little residual THC but but too

3392
02:34:08,011 --> 02:34:12,331
much lower than like a CBD line because

3393
02:34:10,110 --> 02:34:14,671
the CBD synthase gene has gone in those

3394
02:34:12,331 --> 02:34:16,261
plants so that thing can leak on you but

3395
02:34:14,671 --> 02:34:17,851
we think like Sam said it might be the

3396
02:34:16,261 --> 02:34:21,239
cannabic roaming genes that are still

3397
02:34:17,851 --> 02:34:23,280
there leaking some THC and there's some

3398
02:34:21,239 --> 02:34:24,841
plants have that that that's a two mega

3399
02:34:23,280 --> 02:34:26,671
base region in the plants that is

3400
02:34:24,841 --> 02:34:29,190
missing in some plants and present in

3401
02:34:26,671 --> 02:34:32,690
others so there's there's probably a way

3402
02:34:29,190 --> 02:34:37,671
to breed away the cannabic

3403
02:34:32,690 --> 02:34:41,521
the group is a Dortmund they they

3404
02:34:37,671 --> 02:34:45,261
originally saw that found this out to a

3405
02:34:41,521 --> 02:34:50,070
movie five six seven eight years ago and

3406
02:34:45,261 --> 02:34:54,001
they they published about CBD producing

3407
02:34:50,069 --> 02:34:56,851
tea tea in in a fixed ratio but they

3408
02:34:54,001 --> 02:34:59,220
were only looking at either one of the

3409
02:34:56,851 --> 02:35:04,530
synthesis or they were looking at a

3410
02:34:59,220 --> 02:35:07,649
particular suite of them so it could be

3411
02:35:04,530 --> 02:35:10,561
that some of money to doing it you know

3412
02:35:07,649 --> 02:35:13,319
five to one or fifty to one right you

3413
02:35:10,560 --> 02:35:14,671
just yeah there's a good paper from zoo

3414
02:35:13,319 --> 02:35:16,979
bell on this where they did

3415
02:35:14,671 --> 02:35:19,470
site-directed mutagenesis on the enzymes

3416
02:35:16,979 --> 02:35:21,180
I should say in the DNA constructor of

3417
02:35:19,470 --> 02:35:22,739
the enzymes put them into yeast so there

3418
02:35:21,181 --> 02:35:25,621
was only one cannabinoid synthase gene

3419
02:35:22,739 --> 02:35:28,021
per yeast and then measured the ratios

3420
02:35:25,620 --> 02:35:31,140
and it's a really good paper that shows

3421
02:35:28,021 --> 02:35:33,570
like which parts of THC synthase and CBD

3422
02:35:31,140 --> 02:35:36,690
synthase like when you mutate them what

3423
02:35:33,569 --> 02:35:40,050
artifacts do you see do they did they

3424
02:35:36,690 --> 02:35:42,001
have all of the CBD sensations I didn't

3425
02:35:40,050 --> 02:35:44,729
need to know people knew there was

3426
02:35:42,001 --> 02:35:46,851
exactly there are I think they started

3427
02:35:44,729 --> 02:35:50,790
with the canonical one that's an NCBI

3428
02:35:46,851 --> 02:35:52,711
has like an ee number on it and then

3429
02:35:50,790 --> 02:35:54,770
just mutated from there and a lot of the

3430
02:35:52,710 --> 02:35:56,909
variations that they find that do impact

3431
02:35:54,771 --> 02:35:58,739
the yield

3432
02:35:56,909 --> 02:36:00,180
we've not seen naturally yet in the

3433
02:35:58,739 --> 02:36:02,520
sequencing that we've done across those

3434
02:36:00,180 --> 02:36:04,260
genes so they're but they do give us an

3435
02:36:02,520 --> 02:36:05,819
idea of what parts the enzyme like are

3436
02:36:04,260 --> 02:36:08,850
really sensitive to glycosylation

3437
02:36:05,819 --> 02:36:15,799
signals or sensitive to you know other

3438
02:36:08,850 --> 02:36:17,729
types of shown theoretical basis whereas

3439
02:36:15,799 --> 02:36:19,199
yeah they're not representative of

3440
02:36:17,728 --> 02:36:21,599
what's in the marketplace it's just kind

3441
02:36:19,200 --> 02:36:24,840
of like what areas of this gene can we

3442
02:36:21,600 --> 02:36:26,489
break and maybe change the ratio and but

3443
02:36:24,840 --> 02:36:28,049
in all cases the enzymes were

3444
02:36:26,489 --> 02:36:31,199
promiscuous and that they did not

3445
02:36:28,049 --> 02:36:34,019
produce a pure single cannabinoid they

3446
02:36:31,200 --> 02:36:35,850
had no THC synthase produced some

3447
02:36:34,020 --> 02:36:38,450
background and CBD synthase as used to

3448
02:36:35,850 --> 02:36:41,970
have like a twenty three to one ratio of

3449
02:36:38,450 --> 02:36:44,280
CBD to THC but maybe there are natural

3450
02:36:41,969 --> 02:36:46,559
ones out there that are mutated in such

3451
02:36:44,280 --> 02:36:47,939
a way that they actually expand or

3452
02:36:46,559 --> 02:36:49,439
compress that ratio and that's something

3453
02:36:47,939 --> 02:36:53,189
that I think we got to figure out if

3454
02:36:49,439 --> 02:36:58,559
that was done there where they first

3455
02:36:53,189 --> 02:37:01,950
found this I contributed I think six or

3456
02:36:58,559 --> 02:37:04,829
seven or eight different kinds of CBD so

3457
02:37:01,950 --> 02:37:07,740
that they could find more versions of

3458
02:37:04,829 --> 02:37:09,420
synthesis oh cool yeah yeah there's

3459
02:37:07,739 --> 02:37:11,909
definitely a lot of them we have I think

3460
02:37:09,420 --> 02:37:14,760
there's over two hundred and twenty-two

3461
02:37:11,909 --> 02:37:16,770
mutations in THC and CBD synthase alone

3462
02:37:14,760 --> 02:37:17,909
that are on the snip shift that we're

3463
02:37:16,770 --> 02:37:19,860
building and those are just from

3464
02:37:17,909 --> 02:37:21,600
naturally derived plants no no

3465
02:37:19,860 --> 02:37:23,310
mutagenesis done in them so there's

3466
02:37:21,600 --> 02:37:25,110
plenty of variation out there on those

3467
02:37:23,309 --> 02:37:26,939
genes we just don't have good

3468
02:37:25,110 --> 02:37:30,479
connections to what those variations due

3469
02:37:26,939 --> 02:37:31,920
to the chemo type not always getting you

3470
02:37:30,478 --> 02:37:34,228
type information so if you guys ever

3471
02:37:31,920 --> 02:37:37,920
find something that breaks the 25 to one

3472
02:37:34,228 --> 02:37:40,019
rule of CBD to THC coming off of a CBD

3473
02:37:37,920 --> 02:37:41,370
dollar plant call us we'll sequence it

3474
02:37:40,020 --> 02:37:42,689
instantly and see if we can find

3475
02:37:41,370 --> 02:37:46,590
anything in those genes that might be

3476
02:37:42,689 --> 02:37:50,010
predictive of usda compliant heme have

3477
02:37:46,590 --> 02:37:52,670
have you tried grace the variety GW uses

3478
02:37:50,010 --> 02:37:55,829
I don't know that we have access to that

3479
02:37:52,670 --> 02:37:58,739
okay well it's a shame because I

3480
02:37:55,829 --> 02:38:02,280
strongly suspect he breaks it but I

3481
02:37:58,739 --> 02:38:04,530
don't have proof I wish I did yeah Ed's

3482
02:38:02,280 --> 02:38:08,030
Ian's probably has that data I would I

3483
02:38:04,530 --> 02:38:08,030
would imagine I'm sure he's stated

3484
02:38:09,350 --> 02:38:14,370
going deep down the rabbit hole there

3485
02:38:11,939 --> 02:38:18,090
boys I appreciate that it's nice it's

3486
02:38:14,370 --> 02:38:21,390
good you have the varietals that are CB

3487
02:38:18,090 --> 02:38:23,250
g hi c CB g varietals that are high in

3488
02:38:21,389 --> 02:38:25,340
terpenes because the ones that around

3489
02:38:23,250 --> 02:38:27,840
now yeah absolutely

3490
02:38:25,340 --> 02:38:32,430
what's fine in Turkey is like three to

3491
02:38:27,840 --> 02:38:39,469
five percent two to three percent like

3492
02:38:32,430 --> 02:38:42,780
on a fly yeah I think three five percent

3493
02:38:39,469 --> 02:38:47,188
definitely is that the traditional upper

3494
02:38:42,780 --> 02:38:50,430
limits whereas of course they can be

3495
02:38:47,189 --> 02:38:53,670
bridged with sympathy for like folks out

3496
02:38:50,430 --> 02:38:55,829
in a prone step I think they're ten

3497
02:38:53,670 --> 02:39:03,750
percent people are reporting even higher

3498
02:38:55,829 --> 02:39:07,829
I haven't seen most of the CB g that's

3499
02:39:03,750 --> 02:39:10,319
out there now is low low turfs so it's

3500
02:39:07,829 --> 02:39:13,500
um you know it's not as good of a

3501
02:39:10,319 --> 02:39:15,329
smokable hamp type thing as the as the

3502
02:39:13,500 --> 02:39:18,659
high CBD varietals that are high

3503
02:39:15,329 --> 02:39:24,510
terpenes actually the best smokeable is

3504
02:39:18,659 --> 02:39:26,689
high THC believe me and it's your buddy

3505
02:39:24,510 --> 02:39:31,079
varieties coming out whatever leave them

3506
02:39:26,689 --> 02:39:35,220
like a one-to-one or though many to many

3507
02:39:31,079 --> 02:39:37,139
I like equal parts I will click to enter

3508
02:39:35,219 --> 02:39:39,978
full screen mode all right here we go

3509
02:39:37,139 --> 02:39:39,978
marks laying it down

3510
02:39:40,728 --> 02:39:47,309
yeah I think they it's hi-hi terpenes

3511
02:39:44,790 --> 02:39:49,860
DVD is is really evolving and I think

3512
02:39:47,309 --> 02:39:58,649
Stevie G's just just slightly behind it

3513
02:39:49,860 --> 02:40:01,650
CVG herbs CB d pc g h MP d cv g'v yeah I

3514
02:39:58,649 --> 02:40:03,478
can't find the the particular one I'm

3515
02:40:01,649 --> 02:40:06,149
looking for but I just looking on his

3516
02:40:03,478 --> 02:40:09,029
Facebook this is the dude Mateus and

3517
02:40:06,149 --> 02:40:11,760
he's he's a Swiss guy who's in the north

3518
02:40:09,030 --> 02:40:18,270
of Italy but he has a seed production

3519
02:40:11,760 --> 02:40:21,041
operation somewhere in Oregon now well

3520
02:40:18,270 --> 02:40:25,801
he is he connected to Shanti Baba

3521
02:40:21,040 --> 02:40:30,880
no not at all no I know these folks and

3522
02:40:25,800 --> 02:40:40,689
yeah they have a high CBD variety called

3523
02:40:30,880 --> 02:40:45,040
yeah yeah I I tried to buy some of them

3524
02:40:40,690 --> 02:40:47,771
but they wanted minimum orders

3525
02:40:45,040 --> 02:40:51,161
fairly large amounts yeah well anyway

3526
02:40:47,771 --> 02:40:53,141
this is the guy and he does have that

3527
02:40:51,161 --> 02:40:55,870
this isn't the data that I remember

3528
02:40:53,140 --> 02:40:58,569
seeing this is just again indicative of

3529
02:40:55,870 --> 02:41:01,470
the levels that he's seeing here which

3530
02:40:58,569 --> 02:41:07,120
is pretty damn high he had a bag on his

3531
02:41:01,470 --> 02:41:10,779
on his post fear of CBG a hash I've

3532
02:41:07,120 --> 02:41:15,580
never seen CVG a hash before um it

3533
02:41:10,780 --> 02:41:19,030
looked really light Sam let me see if I

3534
02:41:15,581 --> 02:41:21,341
can pull that the color or big dark yeah

3535
02:41:19,030 --> 02:41:22,931
yeah let me stop sharing and let me let

3536
02:41:21,341 --> 02:41:26,140
me look let me look for that and see if

3537
02:41:22,931 --> 02:41:27,819
I can find it mark and we gonna see

3538
02:41:26,140 --> 02:41:38,740
that's incredible

3539
02:41:27,819 --> 02:41:43,210
was it clear what's golden oh it was dry

3540
02:41:38,740 --> 02:41:45,040
sifted cash not water - hey Mark in

3541
02:41:43,210 --> 02:41:48,220
upstate New York with we're making some

3542
02:41:45,040 --> 02:42:00,819
CVG try sift and it's coming up pretty

3543
02:41:48,220 --> 02:42:03,279
light in color hold on a second more can

3544
02:42:00,819 --> 02:42:04,690
have a chromium than THC in these lines

3545
02:42:03,280 --> 02:42:08,141
that's that's kind of a that's an

3546
02:42:04,690 --> 02:42:12,181
interesting ratio can this is very light

3547
02:42:08,140 --> 02:42:17,470
- yeah it looks like white say almost

3548
02:42:12,181 --> 02:42:22,661
yeah beautiful you lizard rose and

3549
02:42:17,470 --> 02:42:28,810
Turkey no lean yeah - pedaling dude

3550
02:42:22,661 --> 02:42:34,120
40% CVG sovereign fields and platonic if

3551
02:42:28,810 --> 02:42:34,818
I'm saying photonics 0.3% he might just

3552
02:42:34,120 --> 02:42:38,088
be saying

3553
02:42:34,818 --> 02:42:42,799
just to her I bet you Sam could get that

3554
02:42:38,088 --> 02:42:47,869
forty up to a solid 75 that's nice it's

3555
02:42:42,799 --> 02:42:50,588
not the way come on beautiful I'd have

3556
02:42:47,869 --> 02:42:54,260
to try I have confidence in you Sam I

3557
02:42:50,588 --> 02:42:58,459
put my money on you hey Mark I commented

3558
02:42:54,260 --> 02:43:04,068
down here because CBG hash I said

3559
02:42:58,459 --> 02:43:06,680
actually see VGA that's awesome that's

3560
02:43:04,068 --> 02:43:11,689
like that's the pothead chemists version

3561
02:43:06,680 --> 02:43:16,520
of like grammar actually you see me

3562
02:43:11,689 --> 02:43:20,029
they're not cool is that

3563
02:43:16,520 --> 02:43:23,629
I guess I'll assume that when you heat

3564
02:43:20,029 --> 02:43:28,720
up see BGA it decarboxylate just like

3565
02:43:23,629 --> 02:43:34,669
THC would so absolutely correct okay so

3566
02:43:28,719 --> 02:43:37,878
the CBG have a psychoactive effect that

3567
02:43:34,668 --> 02:43:42,488
the cb1 receptor do you know Sam no no

3568
02:43:37,879 --> 02:43:46,819
not at all and CPG doesn't get you high

3569
02:43:42,488 --> 02:43:50,448
cbc doesn't get you high CBD doesn't get

3570
02:43:46,818 --> 02:43:52,578
you high THC B doesn't get you high now

3571
02:43:50,449 --> 02:43:56,390
there are people who claim that they

3572
02:43:52,578 --> 02:44:00,889
take CBD they get psychoactive effects

3573
02:43:56,389 --> 02:44:05,238
well it ain't high it's maybe call me

3574
02:44:00,889 --> 02:44:16,488
their lack of paranoia eight it doesn't

3575
02:44:05,238 --> 02:44:19,100
get you high the way no the epic well

3576
02:44:16,488 --> 02:44:24,648
that's not true CB man we'll get you

3577
02:44:19,100 --> 02:44:28,668
loaded and Delta 88 C will also get you

3578
02:44:24,648 --> 02:44:30,769
high but I'm not so sure that Delta

3579
02:44:28,668 --> 02:44:33,709
eight isn't just an artifact of

3580
02:44:30,770 --> 02:44:39,649
lavatories i I've never seen a delegate

3581
02:44:33,709 --> 02:44:43,489
synthase and I don't know if some days

3582
02:44:39,648 --> 02:44:48,078
so Delta nine is what's made in a plant

3583
02:44:43,488 --> 02:44:48,408
and in acid catalyzed isomerization is

3584
02:44:48,078 --> 02:44:51,350
what

3585
02:44:48,408 --> 02:44:54,498
happens to move it over to Delta aid

3586
02:44:51,350 --> 02:44:56,629
yeah that's that's what I'm convinced

3587
02:44:54,498 --> 02:45:04,818
but I keep hearing other people tell me

3588
02:44:56,629 --> 02:45:07,929
that no we found Lt Col we read miss

3589
02:45:04,818 --> 02:45:11,148
EULA's pay permit machine I heard this I

3590
02:45:07,929 --> 02:45:13,639
believe you yeah and you've read miss

3591
02:45:11,148 --> 02:45:15,828
EULA's papers and I've read mushrooms

3592
02:45:13,639 --> 02:45:19,759
papers of what I I can tell you is that

3593
02:45:15,828 --> 02:45:22,189
in his discovery work in fact I should

3594
02:45:19,759 --> 02:45:24,850
tell everybody this I just wrote an

3595
02:45:22,189 --> 02:45:28,219
article for the American Journal of

3596
02:45:24,850 --> 02:45:31,158
endocannabinoid medicine which is Jhon

3597
02:45:28,218 --> 02:45:34,628
mark heussner journal and they want to

3598
02:45:31,158 --> 02:45:37,218
dig deep into the history of cannabinoid

3599
02:45:34,629 --> 02:45:39,709
chemistry so I'm gonna write a few more

3600
02:45:37,218 --> 02:45:42,918
articles for them but it was really cool

3601
02:45:39,709 --> 02:45:46,819
what I found out again is that that

3602
02:45:42,918 --> 02:45:49,369
group in Cambridge at the end of the

3603
02:45:46,818 --> 02:45:52,338
century in the 1890s were the first ones

3604
02:45:49,369 --> 02:45:56,418
to isolate not just cannabinol not just

3605
02:45:52,338 --> 02:46:00,439
CBN but the isolated sea as well so with

3606
02:45:56,418 --> 02:46:03,020
that extra wood yeah yep yep yep yeah I

3607
02:46:00,439 --> 02:46:05,449
would have never get and and check it

3608
02:46:03,020 --> 02:46:07,668
out what I recently read in someone

3609
02:46:05,449 --> 02:46:09,939
else's paper I didn't include this in my

3610
02:46:07,668 --> 02:46:12,529
own but what I would I recently read

3611
02:46:09,939 --> 02:46:15,889
there's that paper that's talking about

3612
02:46:12,529 --> 02:46:18,350
the conversion of CBD over to CBN and

3613
02:46:15,889 --> 02:46:21,108
use an iodine and it was an Italian

3614
02:46:18,350 --> 02:46:25,238
group and the first author on the group

3615
02:46:21,109 --> 02:46:27,799
was Palestra got it yeah on that paper

3616
02:46:25,238 --> 02:46:30,259
check out the acknowledgement to would

3617
02:46:27,799 --> 02:46:32,869
Spivey in this Easter field so the

3618
02:46:30,259 --> 02:46:37,639
research that they did they found that

3619
02:46:32,869 --> 02:46:40,520
both wood and Spivey perished and I

3620
02:46:37,639 --> 02:46:43,218
thought I had heard that one had gotten

3621
02:46:40,520 --> 02:46:46,908
malaria and that's not true at all one

3622
02:46:43,218 --> 02:46:49,398
actually perished in a lab explosion I

3623
02:46:46,908 --> 02:46:51,578
think it was Wood who died the lab

3624
02:46:49,398 --> 02:46:56,358
explosion they were trying to nitrate

3625
02:46:51,578 --> 02:46:59,208
THC to make nitro cannabinol and in that

3626
02:46:56,359 --> 02:47:02,000
experiment I think he exploded and then

3627
02:46:59,209 --> 02:47:05,000
the other guy so not Easter feel

3628
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:07,040
would spivey and easter so that I think

3629
02:47:05,000 --> 02:47:11,988
species the guy who died in the

3630
02:47:07,040 --> 02:47:15,590
explosion would died from basically

3631
02:47:11,988 --> 02:47:17,359
taking too much of the [ __ ] that they

3632
02:47:15,590 --> 02:47:21,109
were making they were making all kinds

3633
02:47:17,359 --> 02:47:25,220
of derivatives in their lab and he ended

3634
02:47:21,109 --> 02:47:26,809
up poisoning himself Easter field was

3635
02:47:25,219 --> 02:47:30,969
the professor that I think they were

3636
02:47:26,809 --> 02:47:34,100
working for and he harsh mistress

3637
02:47:30,969 --> 02:47:37,219
yeah there was a rumor that he also too

3638
02:47:34,100 --> 02:47:39,409
had perished but it turned out now he he

3639
02:47:37,219 --> 02:47:43,608
had actually made it out of New Zealand

3640
02:47:39,409 --> 02:47:45,950
alive and yeah so it was interesting

3641
02:47:43,609 --> 02:47:48,738
what happened to that those those three

3642
02:47:45,950 --> 02:47:52,850
people but they published two papers in

3643
02:47:48,738 --> 02:47:56,840
the 1890s one in 1896 and one in 1899

3644
02:47:52,850 --> 02:48:01,600
and damned if they weren't like the real

3645
02:47:56,840 --> 02:48:05,210
true pioneers who first isolated

3646
02:48:01,600 --> 02:48:07,488
cannabinoids and and they in their paper

3647
02:48:05,209 --> 02:48:10,929
wasn't one of the references they have

3648
02:48:07,488 --> 02:48:14,478
is back to some journal of

3649
02:48:10,930 --> 02:48:17,029
pharmaceuticals from 1850 something and

3650
02:48:14,478 --> 02:48:25,579
I can't find that reference I can't even

3651
02:48:17,029 --> 02:48:29,180
find the journal you know I think it was

3652
02:48:25,579 --> 02:48:33,170
some German article or something like

3653
02:48:29,180 --> 02:48:36,850
that because I think a person both

3654
02:48:33,170 --> 02:48:43,520
German Italian other languages I can't

3655
02:48:36,850 --> 02:48:47,090
but I can google because they're not

3656
02:48:43,520 --> 02:48:50,750
digital they're just scanned the

3657
02:48:47,090 --> 02:48:53,898
journals you know this is like this is

3658
02:48:50,750 --> 02:48:58,579
like contemporary with the discovery of

3659
02:48:53,898 --> 02:49:02,869
the lightbulb these guys isolating THC

3660
02:48:58,579 --> 02:49:05,478
in this lab in Cambridge to me just way

3661
02:49:02,870 --> 02:49:10,130
ahead of their time I mean this is you

3662
02:49:05,478 --> 02:49:12,409
know way before Adams and Khan and so

3663
02:49:10,129 --> 02:49:13,829
yeah that so my next article I'm gonna

3664
02:49:12,409 --> 02:49:16,500
write about Khan

3665
02:49:13,829 --> 02:49:19,020
Robert Sidney Kahn who kind of looked at

3666
02:49:16,500 --> 02:49:22,439
the wood spiffy and Easter fieldwork and

3667
02:49:19,020 --> 02:49:24,899
said you know what their formula isn't

3668
02:49:22,439 --> 02:49:28,139
quite correct and their structure isn't

3669
02:49:24,898 --> 02:49:31,529
quite correct and and a robertson econ

3670
02:49:28,139 --> 02:49:33,779
kind of got the major elements of what

3671
02:49:31,530 --> 02:49:37,770
the correct empirical formula for

3672
02:49:33,780 --> 02:49:39,720
cannabinoids and THC and CBD were so he

3673
02:49:37,770 --> 02:49:44,880
kind of nailed that and he nailed the

3674
02:49:39,719 --> 02:49:47,938
structure and again this is in like 1934

3675
02:49:44,879 --> 02:49:50,879
you know way before Adam C Adams was

3676
02:49:47,939 --> 02:49:53,790
until later in that decade right so then

3677
02:49:50,879 --> 02:49:56,539
then there was Adams and Todd who's

3678
02:49:53,790 --> 02:50:00,510
still this is 20 years before Michelle

3679
02:49:56,540 --> 02:50:07,620
so it's just I love that history it's

3680
02:50:00,510 --> 02:50:11,880
just a wonderful tomorrow that's right

3681
02:50:07,620 --> 02:50:14,130
yep I've said it made absolutely yeah

3682
02:50:11,879 --> 02:50:17,068
but you know what in researching the

3683
02:50:14,129 --> 02:50:19,469
paper that I just wrote what I also kind

3684
02:50:17,068 --> 02:50:22,199
of came to the realization was so what

3685
02:50:19,469 --> 02:50:24,510
he did is he took cash and he

3686
02:50:22,200 --> 02:50:27,180
chromatograph did are the silica gel

3687
02:50:24,510 --> 02:50:31,350
column but then what he did was he took

3688
02:50:27,180 --> 02:50:34,859
the fractions that contain primarily THC

3689
02:50:31,350 --> 02:50:37,620
and he made a crystal and derivative

3690
02:50:34,859 --> 02:50:40,260
that he can crystallize to purity and

3691
02:50:37,620 --> 02:50:44,100
and thinking back to my academic

3692
02:50:40,260 --> 02:50:46,829
training as a chemist one of the classes

3693
02:50:44,100 --> 02:50:49,318
you have is the is the identification of

3694
02:50:46,829 --> 02:50:53,459
organic compounds and it's fascinating

3695
02:50:49,318 --> 02:50:56,059
because back before we had HPLC S&amp;G sees

3696
02:50:53,459 --> 02:50:58,709
and and all this analytical and

3697
02:50:56,059 --> 02:51:01,619
instrumentation that we have now they

3698
02:50:58,709 --> 02:51:03,809
used to make derivatives and crystalline

3699
02:51:01,620 --> 02:51:06,300
derivatives were always popular because

3700
02:51:03,809 --> 02:51:08,969
you could purify it from all the non

3701
02:51:06,299 --> 02:51:12,000
crystalline impurities and so what

3702
02:51:08,969 --> 02:51:16,318
moschella made is he made a crystal and

3703
02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:19,530
derivative that he could purify to the

3704
02:51:16,318 --> 02:51:21,478
henderson with purity and then he

3705
02:51:19,530 --> 02:51:23,550
removed the thing that made it a

3706
02:51:21,478 --> 02:51:26,760
crystalline derivative and then further

3707
02:51:23,549 --> 02:51:27,659
distilled it and so so that way he know

3708
02:51:26,760 --> 02:51:30,271
that it was

3709
02:51:27,659 --> 02:51:33,360
absolutely pure there's no other

3710
02:51:30,271 --> 02:51:37,351
impurities in there and so so yes I'm

3711
02:51:33,360 --> 02:51:40,650
assumed used again NMR like you say Sam

3712
02:51:37,351 --> 02:51:42,079
to solve where the double bond was the

3713
02:51:40,649 --> 02:51:46,319
thing that miffed

3714
02:51:42,079 --> 02:51:48,810
Todd and Khan and Adam this was the fact

3715
02:51:46,319 --> 02:51:52,440
that again they were using derivatives

3716
02:51:48,810 --> 02:51:53,940
ation chemistry to identify what the

3717
02:51:52,440 --> 02:51:56,280
structural components of the

3718
02:51:53,940 --> 02:51:58,680
cannabinoids were and in that

3719
02:51:56,280 --> 02:52:01,409
derivatives a ssin chemistry this goes

3720
02:51:58,680 --> 02:52:04,771
back to Kevin's original point they were

3721
02:52:01,409 --> 02:52:07,319
ice on rising it over to Delta eight so

3722
02:52:04,771 --> 02:52:09,870
if you look at the structures in atoms

3723
02:52:07,319 --> 02:52:12,209
this work from the forties you'll see

3724
02:52:09,870 --> 02:52:14,790
they're all Delta eight configured

3725
02:52:12,209 --> 02:52:16,770
because a lot of times the first thing

3726
02:52:14,790 --> 02:52:19,230
they did is well let's hit with acid and

3727
02:52:16,771 --> 02:52:22,739
see what happens and that's exactly how

3728
02:52:19,229 --> 02:52:25,529
Spivey died they were trying a nitration

3729
02:52:22,739 --> 02:52:28,021
with nitric acid and sulfuric acid

3730
02:52:25,530 --> 02:52:31,290
that's also the same explosion that

3731
02:52:28,021 --> 02:52:34,829
killed Lamont DuPont who was the son of

3732
02:52:31,290 --> 02:52:36,891
the VI DuPont the founder of the DuPont

3733
02:52:34,829 --> 02:52:39,719
company was killed in a nitration

3734
02:52:36,890 --> 02:52:43,979
explosion in the rapado works over in

3735
02:52:39,719 --> 02:52:46,049
new jersey so so yeah man I love

3736
02:52:43,979 --> 02:52:48,239
chemical history like that it's so

3737
02:52:46,049 --> 02:52:51,119
[ __ ] cool and digging into the

3738
02:52:48,239 --> 02:52:53,489
cannabinoid chemistry because it was

3739
02:52:51,120 --> 02:52:55,680
kind of like this outlaw thing that only

3740
02:52:53,489 --> 02:52:58,229
certain labs did like there was

3741
02:52:55,680 --> 02:53:01,140
obviously machine who arguably was the

3742
02:52:58,229 --> 02:53:03,270
kind of like the Shulkin the Sasha

3743
02:53:01,140 --> 02:53:07,619
children of cannabinoid chemistry but

3744
02:53:03,271 --> 02:53:12,570
just like Sasha Shogun Michonne stood on

3745
02:53:07,620 --> 02:53:14,880
the shoulders of Adams yeah of giants

3746
02:53:12,569 --> 02:53:17,610
right all the people who came before and

3747
02:53:14,879 --> 02:53:21,149
masoom will humbly like any chemist like

3748
02:53:17,610 --> 02:53:24,540
myself will humbly admit that that we

3749
02:53:21,149 --> 02:53:27,029
were we're here today because of all of

3750
02:53:24,540 --> 02:53:30,271
these people who did this previous work

3751
02:53:27,030 --> 02:53:33,329
so these Brits who were distilling THC

3752
02:53:30,271 --> 02:53:36,180
back before the turn of the century they

3753
02:53:33,329 --> 02:53:39,120
didn't know it but here we are now over

3754
02:53:36,180 --> 02:53:41,220
a hundred years later reading their

3755
02:53:39,120 --> 02:53:43,409
landmark work

3756
02:53:41,219 --> 02:53:45,809
and you know what their boiling point

3757
02:53:43,408 --> 02:53:48,148
was spot [ __ ] on I mean it was

3758
02:53:45,809 --> 02:53:51,148
exactly the way it should have been

3759
02:53:48,148 --> 02:53:53,488
which is the reason why I believe they

3760
02:53:51,148 --> 02:53:57,840
didn't just isolate cannabinol they

3761
02:53:53,488 --> 02:54:00,568
isolated THC in 1896 and it was really

3762
02:53:57,840 --> 02:54:02,578
for many years thought that because they

3763
02:54:00,568 --> 02:54:05,458
called it kanaev and all that

3764
02:54:02,578 --> 02:54:08,248
oh they isolated CBN but I don't think

3765
02:54:05,459 --> 02:54:12,149
they isolated CBN I think they isolated

3766
02:54:08,248 --> 02:54:16,049
THC and I think if you go into mushrooms

3767
02:54:12,148 --> 02:54:18,059
paper machine has a wide body of papers

3768
02:54:16,049 --> 02:54:21,478
and the scientific literature he

3769
02:54:18,059 --> 02:54:24,090
references all of this prior work by

3770
02:54:21,478 --> 02:54:25,170
Robert Sidney Kahn and Easter field

3771
02:54:24,090 --> 02:54:27,510
wooden Spivey

3772
02:54:25,170 --> 02:54:32,279
all those people just it's fascinating

3773
02:54:27,510 --> 02:54:35,609
to go through the Machine important to

3774
02:54:32,279 --> 02:54:38,180
kind of rediscover all of that chemistry

3775
02:54:35,609 --> 02:54:41,340
just like in the same way that I

3776
02:54:38,180 --> 02:54:44,369
discovered bluegrass music through the

3777
02:54:41,340 --> 02:54:46,828
olden in the way record right which

3778
02:54:44,369 --> 02:54:49,949
which led me to this portal of Bill

3779
02:54:46,828 --> 02:54:52,738
Monroe bluegrass that I had no clue even

3780
02:54:49,949 --> 02:54:55,050
existed right I found it through this

3781
02:54:52,738 --> 02:54:57,299
portal although no well yeah I was one

3782
02:54:55,049 --> 02:54:59,129
of Jerry Garcia's projects but it was

3783
02:54:57,299 --> 02:55:01,259
the Jerry Garcia thing that brought me

3784
02:54:59,129 --> 02:55:03,599
into it and now I discovered this whole

3785
02:55:01,260 --> 02:55:06,029
world of bluegrass Misbah is kind of

3786
02:55:03,600 --> 02:55:08,880
like I knew about Missoula and I knew

3787
02:55:06,029 --> 02:55:12,119
about his important work but I had no

3788
02:55:08,879 --> 02:55:15,238
clue really or no real appreciation for

3789
02:55:12,119 --> 02:55:18,659
all the work that was done in the Prima

3790
02:55:15,238 --> 02:55:22,049
shulam cannabinoid chemist the Truman is

3791
02:55:18,658 --> 02:55:26,279
written very very good reviews so has

3792
02:55:22,049 --> 02:55:29,429
illumise it so heavy deep trunk and yet

3793
02:55:26,279 --> 02:55:33,689
Roger portray that's right Roger all

3794
02:55:29,430 --> 02:55:36,600
three men written fantastic and Missoula

3795
02:55:33,689 --> 02:55:40,559
two or three times has has written

3796
02:55:36,600 --> 02:55:43,470
histories of it have you guys seen that

3797
02:55:40,559 --> 02:55:43,889
work on cannabinol bone that just came

3798
02:55:43,469 --> 02:55:47,429
out

3799
02:55:43,889 --> 02:55:50,278
yes that's what I'm smoking right now

3800
02:55:47,430 --> 02:55:53,988
yeah we we talked about that in fact I

3801
02:55:50,279 --> 02:55:55,939
reached out to the guy through chimera

3802
02:55:53,988 --> 02:55:58,010
you guys know chimera right yeah yeah

3803
02:55:55,939 --> 02:55:59,930
they're in Italy right yeah so I reached

3804
02:55:58,010 --> 02:56:01,670
out to the guy through because you would

3805
02:55:59,930 --> 02:56:02,750
think Kevin I mean again I'm just

3806
02:56:01,670 --> 02:56:06,199
throwing this out there

3807
02:56:02,750 --> 02:56:08,809
if Allah all tobik acid is its

3808
02:56:06,199 --> 02:56:12,319
biosynthetic precursor wouldn't you

3809
02:56:08,809 --> 02:56:15,769
think can a bomb Evonik acid would be

3810
02:56:12,318 --> 02:56:21,170
what exhibit should have the acid group

3811
02:56:15,770 --> 02:56:24,649
next to the phenolic Oh H right the

3812
02:56:21,170 --> 02:56:30,170
other possibility could be that it's

3813
02:56:24,648 --> 02:56:34,369
being produced the way THC is produced

3814
02:56:30,170 --> 02:56:37,760
by Stevie Dee said bases I'm not saying

3815
02:56:34,370 --> 02:56:39,170
that's more likely I just say well

3816
02:56:37,760 --> 02:56:41,449
you're just probably underwent

3817
02:56:39,170 --> 02:56:44,148
adventitious decarboxylation and if

3818
02:56:41,449 --> 02:56:46,670
they're characterizing the extract by GC

3819
02:56:44,148 --> 02:56:49,129
obviously it's gonna be carboxylate in

3820
02:56:46,670 --> 02:56:51,398
the in the GC and it would be

3821
02:56:49,129 --> 02:56:54,799
interesting if they actually are

3822
02:56:51,398 --> 02:56:57,590
isolating the the carboxylic acid of

3823
02:56:54,799 --> 02:57:00,019
that again I I don't know like like when

3824
02:56:57,590 --> 02:57:02,059
people are talking about CBG just go

3825
02:57:00,020 --> 02:57:04,970
back to that for a second there seems to

3826
02:57:02,059 --> 02:57:07,939
be a lot of emphasis and CBG is this

3827
02:57:04,969 --> 02:57:11,179
really for CVG or is it the acid and

3828
02:57:07,939 --> 02:57:15,380
like you said Sam it D carboxylates just

3829
02:57:11,180 --> 02:57:17,960
like just like THC would so I'm trying

3830
02:57:15,379 --> 02:57:21,349
to understand whether or not the acids

3831
02:57:17,959 --> 02:57:24,228
are of you know just differential

3832
02:57:21,350 --> 02:57:27,380
interest you know got an interesting

3833
02:57:24,228 --> 02:57:31,099
five carbon ring as the outside of the

3834
02:57:27,379 --> 02:57:33,318
live atomic acid so it's typical six

3835
02:57:31,100 --> 02:57:36,738
carbons a ketone right it's got a ketone

3836
02:57:33,318 --> 02:57:41,119
on its guy mojito and methyl ketones can

3837
02:57:36,738 --> 02:57:43,520
sometimes make a bass with a with a with

3838
02:57:41,120 --> 02:57:46,160
a primary amino group and so sometimes

3839
02:57:43,520 --> 02:57:50,090
those are like that's a cross-linking

3840
02:57:46,159 --> 02:57:54,199
reaction for proteins oh yeah

3841
02:57:50,090 --> 02:57:57,290
the chemistry is above me but if it

3842
02:57:54,199 --> 02:57:59,180
comes from a planet I'm interested yeah

3843
02:57:57,290 --> 02:58:01,100
this one they claim it does I don't

3844
02:57:59,180 --> 02:58:04,340
think they mentioned like what

3845
02:58:01,100 --> 02:58:05,840
concentration they found it in this is

3846
02:58:04,340 --> 02:58:07,270
different from the Italian work that

3847
02:58:05,840 --> 02:58:12,500
found

3848
02:58:07,270 --> 02:58:15,380
TCP I've got the paper I've had it for a

3849
02:58:12,500 --> 02:58:17,870
couple of weeks yeah yeah yeah yeah so

3850
02:58:15,379 --> 02:58:19,818
you know they talked about PP r gamma

3851
02:58:17,870 --> 02:58:22,850
receptors and but I don't think I

3852
02:58:19,818 --> 02:58:26,930
remember correctly this compound was

3853
02:58:22,850 --> 02:58:30,170
first found she was 5 or 10 years ago it

3854
02:58:26,930 --> 02:58:32,568
was yet hemp you're right hey Kevin

3855
02:58:30,170 --> 02:58:33,770
let's talk about TCP just for a second

3856
02:58:32,568 --> 02:58:36,019
because I don't think you're on that

3857
02:58:33,770 --> 02:58:39,380
hash search when we were talking about

3858
02:58:36,020 --> 02:58:44,630
that paper yes so the fact that it's the

3859
02:58:39,379 --> 02:58:47,389
two carbon higher homologue of the of

3860
02:58:44,629 --> 02:58:50,269
the cannabinoids I said well doesn't

3861
02:58:47,389 --> 02:58:52,010
that make sense that like and I guess

3862
02:58:50,270 --> 02:58:55,310
the three carbon one is that is the

3863
02:58:52,010 --> 02:58:58,790
Varon right you have the Varon and you

3864
02:58:55,309 --> 02:59:01,309
have then you have THC then you have THC

3865
02:58:58,790 --> 02:59:03,290
P well [ __ ] don't you think maybe like

3866
02:59:01,309 --> 02:59:06,199
there's a little bit of line in there

3867
02:59:03,290 --> 02:59:09,109
and maybe a little bit of 11 so every

3868
02:59:06,200 --> 02:59:11,120
two carbons perhaps yeah so do you think

3869
02:59:09,109 --> 02:59:13,818
these group did

3870
02:59:11,120 --> 02:59:15,319
Dimitra expose this I care or presented

3871
02:59:13,818 --> 02:59:17,478
this I can med this year were they they

3872
02:59:15,318 --> 02:59:20,000
took THC synthase cloned it in yeast and

3873
02:59:17,478 --> 02:59:22,369
fed at different chain-linked precursors

3874
02:59:20,000 --> 02:59:24,379
so they gave it hexanoic acid and got

3875
02:59:22,370 --> 02:59:27,620
THC out they gave it ought to know ik

3876
02:59:24,379 --> 02:59:30,049
acid and got THC P out I think they use

3877
02:59:27,620 --> 02:59:33,649
a butane derivative of some sort to get

3878
02:59:30,049 --> 02:59:35,238
the Varens out I didn't I gotta go back

3879
02:59:33,648 --> 02:59:39,108
and look at his presentation maybe he

3880
02:59:35,238 --> 02:59:41,209
also put a 10 mer in there and and and

3881
02:59:39,109 --> 02:59:44,270
and got a longer chain length out as

3882
02:59:41,209 --> 02:59:46,669
well that went out to maybe nine but it

3883
02:59:44,270 --> 02:59:48,200
was fascinating that the east have no

3884
02:59:46,670 --> 02:59:50,059
problem making these things so that so

3885
02:59:48,200 --> 02:59:53,390
the THC synthase doesn't care it's

3886
02:59:50,059 --> 02:59:56,719
really happening upstream probably at

3887
02:59:53,389 --> 02:59:58,250
got or live at all gas at cyclase or

3888
02:59:56,719 --> 03:00:01,608
parental transfer I don't know which one

3889
02:59:58,250 --> 03:00:03,439
is involved with that but it's it the

3890
03:00:01,609 --> 03:00:05,000
this the the the last step of the

3891
03:00:03,439 --> 03:00:07,970
synthesis doesn't care a bit about the

3892
03:00:05,000 --> 03:00:10,100
chain length so let me ask a question

3893
03:00:07,969 --> 03:00:12,920
this is something I speculated on and I

3894
03:00:10,100 --> 03:00:16,939
don't know but like if I get a really

3895
03:00:12,920 --> 03:00:19,760
good live resin product let's see this

3896
03:00:16,939 --> 03:00:21,021
one here if I add up my cannabinoids and

3897
03:00:19,760 --> 03:00:23,720
I

3898
03:00:21,021 --> 03:00:30,800
my terpene sigh of eighty percent total

3899
03:00:23,720 --> 03:00:34,760
cannabinoids and 15% so there's 5%

3900
03:00:30,799 --> 03:00:37,729
unknown right 5% other stuff don't you

3901
03:00:34,760 --> 03:00:43,420
think like like part of that other stuff

3902
03:00:37,729 --> 03:00:46,789
could be team CPE do you see me yeah

3903
03:00:43,420 --> 03:00:49,370
just like a whole family of of things

3904
03:00:46,790 --> 03:00:54,800
that show I don't know if I'm using the

3905
03:00:49,370 --> 03:00:58,579
terminology correctly a lack of well or

3906
03:00:54,799 --> 03:01:02,090
promiscuity of the enzymes active site

3907
03:00:58,579 --> 03:01:04,909
to act on a spectrum of substrates as

3908
03:01:02,090 --> 03:01:06,590
opposed to just the one yeah yeah no I

3909
03:01:04,909 --> 03:01:09,129
think so I'm wondering if you can add

3910
03:01:06,590 --> 03:01:12,681
them as well like how could you boost

3911
03:01:09,129 --> 03:01:14,539
production of hexanoic acid versus oxen

3912
03:01:12,681 --> 03:01:16,760
milk acids like is there a way to do

3913
03:01:14,540 --> 03:01:18,590
that in a Jasmine pathway or can you

3914
03:01:16,760 --> 03:01:19,970
even I don't even know if you could

3915
03:01:18,590 --> 03:01:21,799
supplement them or spray them because

3916
03:01:19,970 --> 03:01:23,029
they're effectively like alkanes right

3917
03:01:21,799 --> 03:01:24,560
they they would effectively melt your

3918
03:01:23,030 --> 03:01:27,110
trichomes if you spray too much of that

3919
03:01:24,560 --> 03:01:29,629
stuff right yeah well the thing that I

3920
03:01:27,110 --> 03:01:32,601
think is that this it's hexanoic come

3921
03:01:29,629 --> 03:01:36,649
from glucose which is a c6 so yeah I

3922
03:01:32,601 --> 03:01:39,050
have it's got to have a sugar precursor

3923
03:01:36,649 --> 03:01:42,170
to it right I mean III don't know this

3924
03:01:39,049 --> 03:01:46,549
for sure yeah a lot along the Krebs

3925
03:01:42,170 --> 03:01:49,101
cycle but so so the question is is like

3926
03:01:46,549 --> 03:01:52,100
like people have been asking oh man that

3927
03:01:49,101 --> 03:01:54,170
stuff's 30 times 30 times higher or it

3928
03:01:52,101 --> 03:01:57,590
gets you I guess they did a docking

3929
03:01:54,170 --> 03:02:00,470
study yeah doctor site and they found

3930
03:01:57,590 --> 03:02:03,170
that it had you know 34 more affinities

3931
03:02:00,470 --> 03:02:05,989
yeah that's just a delta G measurement

3932
03:02:03,170 --> 03:02:08,810
really I mean so so here's the point

3933
03:02:05,989 --> 03:02:11,119
here's the long belaboured point I'm

3934
03:02:08,810 --> 03:02:13,279
trying to make which is that if you look

3935
03:02:11,120 --> 03:02:17,120
at the entourage effect and if you

3936
03:02:13,280 --> 03:02:18,320
assume that okay so in that stuff I got

3937
03:02:17,120 --> 03:02:21,891
from the dispensary

3938
03:02:18,319 --> 03:02:25,851
they know what 80% is cannabinoids 15%

3939
03:02:21,890 --> 03:02:29,449
13 there's 5% other stuff right so that

3940
03:02:25,851 --> 03:02:32,290
other stuff could have like T it C P

3941
03:02:29,450 --> 03:02:34,340
which is could go the whole way yeah

3942
03:02:32,290 --> 03:02:36,590
right

3943
03:02:34,340 --> 03:02:40,460
part of that entourage effect are these

3944
03:02:36,590 --> 03:02:44,148
smaller amounts of like a TCP and who

3945
03:02:40,459 --> 03:02:45,889
knows if c9 the c11 whatever you think

3946
03:02:44,148 --> 03:02:47,449
that there could be something to that if

3947
03:02:45,889 --> 03:02:48,739
they do yeah I mean I guess we got to

3948
03:02:47,450 --> 03:02:51,079
figure out what the standards are and

3949
03:02:48,739 --> 03:02:53,389
how to measure this stuff on HPLC ease

3950
03:02:51,079 --> 03:02:57,228
so that we're not I really disagree

3951
03:02:53,389 --> 03:03:00,858
because I don't think the amount of THC

3952
03:02:57,228 --> 03:03:03,379
P would amount to diddly spot it's

3953
03:03:00,859 --> 03:03:06,890
probably even in the concentrate like to

3954
03:03:03,379 --> 03:03:09,339
talk about there's 80 percent THC if

3955
03:03:06,889 --> 03:03:15,579
that's what the cannabinoid is and

3956
03:03:09,340 --> 03:03:18,889
there's point zero zero one or left

3957
03:03:15,579 --> 03:03:20,510
right it's so so so maybe but there

3958
03:03:18,889 --> 03:03:23,000
could what are the other phantom

3959
03:03:20,510 --> 03:03:28,659
compounds there's some other things in

3960
03:03:23,000 --> 03:03:33,350
there that's making up that other 5% CBD

3961
03:03:28,659 --> 03:03:36,319
no no no no all the cats of Pennsylvania

3962
03:03:33,350 --> 03:03:39,890
they measure all seven I think it's

3963
03:03:36,319 --> 03:03:42,020
seven and maybe it's nine let's see yeah

3964
03:03:39,889 --> 03:03:44,389
yeah I think they measure nine different

3965
03:03:42,020 --> 03:03:47,329
cannabinoids so all those cannabinoids

3966
03:03:44,389 --> 03:03:49,670
have been accounted for the terpenes I

3967
03:03:47,329 --> 03:03:51,648
mean it's a nice saucy product you saw

3968
03:03:49,670 --> 03:04:00,469
my stocks well but nobody was measuring

3969
03:03:51,648 --> 03:04:02,510
THC or CBD THC no they were they could

3970
03:04:00,469 --> 03:04:04,429
be peek under peak on some on the ground

3971
03:04:02,510 --> 03:04:08,840
okay but like I said they weren't

3972
03:04:04,430 --> 03:04:12,439
measuring yeah see that's just the point

3973
03:04:08,840 --> 03:04:15,398
Sam is is that at last five percent of

3974
03:04:12,439 --> 03:04:19,010
stuff that my state doesn't test for is

3975
03:04:15,398 --> 03:04:22,398
really the key differentiator ultimately

3976
03:04:19,010 --> 03:04:24,739
on why it works so well right it's the

3977
03:04:22,398 --> 03:04:29,029
cannabinoids and the terpenes yes and

3978
03:04:24,739 --> 03:04:37,489
that's a high but you could also be

3979
03:04:29,030 --> 03:04:40,010
presumably murky mark but I think you

3980
03:04:37,489 --> 03:04:43,789
make a good point that you know that 5%

3981
03:04:40,010 --> 03:04:46,520
in terms of numbers is a lot and and

3982
03:04:43,790 --> 03:04:48,050
that's a lot of unknown that you know

3983
03:04:46,520 --> 03:04:50,180
it's a you know to bring

3984
03:04:48,049 --> 03:04:52,759
all looks good to speak it's like you

3985
03:04:50,180 --> 03:04:57,139
know that 5% you know it might not be th

3986
03:04:52,760 --> 03:04:59,210
TP but it could be other acid maybe

3987
03:04:57,139 --> 03:05:01,939
isn't 30 times better but maybe only

3988
03:04:59,209 --> 03:05:04,579
like five or six or seven times better

3989
03:05:01,939 --> 03:05:06,739
right and it's only there in a fraction

3990
03:05:04,579 --> 03:05:09,350
of a percent and maybe there's two or

3991
03:05:06,739 --> 03:05:11,739
three things someone today was asking

3992
03:05:09,350 --> 03:05:15,020
online in the chat about flavonoids and

3993
03:05:11,739 --> 03:05:18,379
I think a lot of these low-temperature

3994
03:05:15,020 --> 03:05:20,270
butane extractions I think a lot of

3995
03:05:18,379 --> 03:05:22,938
flavonoids come through I mean I would

3996
03:05:20,270 --> 03:05:25,399
see any reason why they wouldn't I think

3997
03:05:22,939 --> 03:05:40,398
that's most reason why all the stuffs

3998
03:05:25,398 --> 03:05:47,239
colored deactivated 'high from from

3999
03:05:40,398 --> 03:05:51,439
smokey but a certain fraction of that 5%

4000
03:05:47,239 --> 03:05:55,129
of extractables is flavonoids like if

4001
03:05:51,439 --> 03:05:56,960
it's 0.5 or point 2 flavonoids have high

4002
03:05:55,129 --> 03:05:59,358
extinction coefficients which mean

4003
03:05:56,959 --> 03:06:01,789
they're highly colored so a little bit

4004
03:05:59,359 --> 03:06:03,829
of flavonoid can really color it and the

4005
03:06:01,790 --> 03:06:05,960
fact that most cannabis extracts are

4006
03:06:03,829 --> 03:06:07,818
loose the things that I see are mostly

4007
03:06:05,959 --> 03:06:10,879
like you know like this kind of color

4008
03:06:07,818 --> 03:06:12,439
this kind of color I mean it terpenes if

4009
03:06:10,879 --> 03:06:15,170
you isolate the terpenes are all

4010
03:06:12,439 --> 03:06:17,420
colorless yeah cannabinoid should be

4011
03:06:15,170 --> 03:06:20,840
colorless the thing that's colored here

4012
03:06:17,420 --> 03:06:23,809
I believe is the flavonoids I don't know

4013
03:06:20,840 --> 03:06:28,600
that for a fact I just think that the

4014
03:06:23,809 --> 03:06:31,568
colorant oxidized cannabinoids and

4015
03:06:28,600 --> 03:06:34,670
oxidized terpenes you have gone over

4016
03:06:31,568 --> 03:06:35,299
well at least the oxidization color

4017
03:06:34,670 --> 03:06:42,049
exits

4018
03:06:35,299 --> 03:06:43,429
yeah reddish and yellow colors yeah well

4019
03:06:42,049 --> 03:06:46,579
that was pretty deep down the rabbit

4020
03:06:43,430 --> 03:06:49,068
hole not too bad I went a little bit

4021
03:06:46,579 --> 03:06:50,568
past noon but I loved it it's good just

4022
03:06:49,068 --> 03:06:55,579
keep talking if you guys want to talk

4023
03:06:50,568 --> 03:06:57,859
I'm not I'm not opposed well I haven't

4024
03:06:55,579 --> 03:06:59,780
spoke with Kevin in a while Kevin it's

4025
03:06:57,859 --> 03:07:01,610
been a while right where we've both been

4026
03:06:59,780 --> 03:07:04,250
on it's like Kevin's been I

4027
03:07:01,610 --> 03:07:07,521
and I was traveling one time and I think

4028
03:07:04,250 --> 03:07:17,870
I've been on and Kevin takes quarantines

4029
03:07:07,521 --> 03:07:20,091
unfortunately yeah hey let me a shout

4030
03:07:17,870 --> 03:07:22,551
out the great went post that poster

4031
03:07:20,091 --> 03:07:26,021
that's behind you that's that sounds

4032
03:07:22,550 --> 03:07:27,739
pretty sick yeah

4033
03:07:26,021 --> 03:07:29,480
reminiscing on some of them have you

4034
03:07:27,739 --> 03:07:32,539
heard that podcast of theirs now they

4035
03:07:29,479 --> 03:07:38,859
talk about the swamp I remember being at

4036
03:07:32,540 --> 03:07:41,511
the swamp yeah I can't believe it yeah

4037
03:07:38,860 --> 03:07:42,290
yeah I think Marcus was there Marcus

4038
03:07:41,511 --> 03:07:45,079
weren't you there

4039
03:07:42,290 --> 03:07:47,841
no I was not there I think the biggest

4040
03:07:45,079 --> 03:07:50,030
kind of big thing that fish ever put on

4041
03:07:47,841 --> 03:07:52,011
that I went to which wasn't a big thing

4042
03:07:50,030 --> 03:07:55,460
at all it just ended up being historic

4043
03:07:52,011 --> 03:07:57,351
was well I was at the the live one the

4044
03:07:55,459 --> 03:08:01,250
tweezer that they put on there in Bangor

4045
03:07:57,351 --> 03:08:03,170
Maine but it was 94 Halloween show in

4046
03:08:01,250 --> 03:08:05,300
Glens Falls where they did the double

4047
03:08:03,170 --> 03:08:07,101
whiteout oh the way though yeah yeah I

4048
03:08:05,300 --> 03:08:10,039
was front row Center for that it was

4049
03:08:07,101 --> 03:08:13,641
absolutely bonkers so long it was five

4050
03:08:10,040 --> 03:08:15,230
and a half hours which 494 was I think

4051
03:08:13,640 --> 03:08:16,819
it might have been the longest concert

4052
03:08:15,229 --> 03:08:19,129
they'd ever played to date that wasn't

4053
03:08:16,819 --> 03:08:21,199
like some specialized New Year's show or

4054
03:08:19,129 --> 03:08:32,840
something you know it was long it was

4055
03:08:21,200 --> 03:08:35,570
good happy to be there working 1991 EMU

4056
03:08:32,841 --> 03:08:37,220
Wow huh and then they played the Hilton

4057
03:08:35,569 --> 03:08:39,920
in Eugene and that's and I think they

4058
03:08:37,220 --> 03:08:45,079
start their first bouncing ball and the

4059
03:08:39,920 --> 03:08:47,239
bouncing around the room the room yeah

4060
03:08:45,079 --> 03:08:53,659
but here's the thing how many

4061
03:08:47,239 --> 03:08:55,039
Doniak slices do you have my college

4062
03:08:53,659 --> 03:08:58,851
stuff I bet I still have some of those

4063
03:08:55,040 --> 03:09:01,730
in there wife's actually was gonna

4064
03:08:58,851 --> 03:09:04,101
picture farm she's got a bunch of photos

4065
03:09:01,729 --> 03:09:07,970
from your Amy's farm days so fishman and

4066
03:09:04,101 --> 03:09:10,370
in a wedding dress oh nice yeah Amy's

4067
03:09:07,970 --> 03:09:15,170
farm was a big deal that was remember

4068
03:09:10,370 --> 03:09:19,010
when we used to play chess yeah audience

4069
03:09:15,170 --> 03:09:21,350
versus man right yeah yeah and what else

4070
03:09:19,010 --> 03:09:23,300
we got here we got amazingly one at one

4071
03:09:21,350 --> 03:09:27,530
time didn't they beat the audience at

4072
03:09:23,299 --> 03:09:30,619
one point no it was a draw yeah and they

4073
03:09:27,530 --> 03:09:35,120
had a move each night for fall 95

4074
03:09:30,620 --> 03:09:42,189
leading up to yeah the run at the garden

4075
03:09:35,120 --> 03:09:42,189
is this this is fall this might be that

4076
03:09:45,700 --> 03:10:03,229
my first concert was in 1984 and it was

4077
03:09:49,520 --> 03:10:05,420
like Iron Maiden that's good Boston more

4078
03:10:03,228 --> 03:10:11,929
than feeling but guess who opened up for

4079
03:10:05,420 --> 03:10:18,889
Iron Maiden in 1984 any guesses Steve oh

4080
03:10:11,930 --> 03:10:22,479
no no it was Twisted Sister you can't

4081
03:10:18,889 --> 03:10:25,459
even make that [ __ ] up that is Tiny Tim

4082
03:10:22,478 --> 03:10:26,119
well I mean pretty much on some like

4083
03:10:25,459 --> 03:10:32,299
crazy

4084
03:10:26,120 --> 03:10:33,740
ketamine or something I was gonna say

4085
03:10:32,299 --> 03:10:37,789
since you know we're all well

4086
03:10:33,739 --> 03:10:39,350
quarantined you know there's there's a

4087
03:10:37,790 --> 03:10:42,260
lot of musicians out there that are that

4088
03:10:39,350 --> 03:10:44,149
are offering music up now and I think it

4089
03:10:42,260 --> 03:10:46,760
now's a good time to support this

4090
03:10:44,149 --> 03:10:49,100
artists and to support those musicians

4091
03:10:46,760 --> 03:10:51,620
that are you know they're they're forced

4092
03:10:49,100 --> 03:10:54,319
home like all of us but this is you know

4093
03:10:51,620 --> 03:10:56,800
it's more than as we all know just like

4094
03:10:54,319 --> 03:10:59,719
what we do it's it's it's extremely

4095
03:10:56,799 --> 03:11:03,079
stressful and it's a hard time for them

4096
03:10:59,719 --> 03:11:04,909
so if we can go to band camp and I think

4097
03:11:03,079 --> 03:11:07,159
you know a hundred percent of the

4098
03:11:04,909 --> 03:11:09,139
proceeds are going the artists right now

4099
03:11:07,159 --> 03:11:10,520
if we can you know find your favorite

4100
03:11:09,139 --> 03:11:13,849
artist and pitch and I think gonna go a

4101
03:11:10,520 --> 03:11:15,439
long way to them speak volumes to to the

4102
03:11:13,850 --> 03:11:18,350
fan base out there that still care about

4103
03:11:15,439 --> 03:11:21,559
music and deep listen to albums go back

4104
03:11:18,350 --> 03:11:23,569
to shows and close your eyes and I'm

4105
03:11:21,559 --> 03:11:25,639
getting into it very good idea you've

4106
03:11:23,569 --> 03:11:27,079
been some really good time for that you

4107
03:11:25,639 --> 03:11:28,788
know it's such a good time to get back

4108
03:11:27,079 --> 03:11:30,888
to putting on

4109
03:11:28,789 --> 03:11:33,649
record and focusing in on it like a film

4110
03:11:30,888 --> 03:11:35,478
or you know and just kind of being in

4111
03:11:33,648 --> 03:11:37,968
the moment with it it's you know we were

4112
03:11:35,478 --> 03:11:39,948
so distracted with with so much that

4113
03:11:37,968 --> 03:11:41,328
it'll it'll you know it gives us a

4114
03:11:39,949 --> 03:11:43,609
chance to ground ourselves and bring

4115
03:11:41,328 --> 03:11:45,770
ourselves back to you know things we

4116
03:11:43,609 --> 03:11:48,469
enjoy the simple things so if any you

4117
03:11:45,770 --> 03:11:50,418
guys are out there looking for something

4118
03:11:48,468 --> 03:11:51,978
to do I think that's a really great way

4119
03:11:50,418 --> 03:11:53,779
to get grounded

4120
03:11:51,978 --> 03:11:55,788
well how I'm gonna finish this off

4121
