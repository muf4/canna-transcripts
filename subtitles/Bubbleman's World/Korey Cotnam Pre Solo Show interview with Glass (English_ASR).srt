Wiggies the the the art in this one and

33
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:32,359
the colors loved you pulled this one out

34
00:01:29,478 --> 00:01:34,599
first and it just absolutely blew my

35
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:36,519
mind and when you pulled this one out I

36
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:38,959
think it was about second and I just

37
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:42,438
thought holy smokes like the same colors

38
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:45,438
and lines but in an actual pipe I will

39
00:01:42,438 --> 00:01:47,398
admit I was not 100% sure that this was

40
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:49,639
even a pipe when you first pulled it out

41
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:51,359
cuz I was looking inside I was like oh

42
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,399
they're all sealed up like maybe this is

43
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:56,039
like a hummingbird feeder I don't then I

44
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:57,560
saw the down stem and obviously guys I'm

51
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,080
you know these are only four pieces

52
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:13,000
there are more than four pieces in the

53
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,080
show you've got a a whole slew I saw

54
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,680
yeah I've already sent them a whole

55
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,160
arsenal of work so they're taking

56
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,599
pictures or getting t-shirts made

57
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:22,519
stickers I saw the t-shirts what were

58
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:24,238

59
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:26,039
there's the two posters that they made

60
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,319

61
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:29,959

63
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:34,280
few shirts available at the Show

64
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:36,560
excellent so this is sort of you know

65
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:39,400
the culmination of wouldn't you say I

66
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,400
mean obviously your entire career but

67
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:44,239
the the the the recyclers and how you've

68
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,719
really been trying to you know innovate

69
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,719
that recycler and create something

70
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:49,878
that's really you know more Corey than

71
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:51,719
anything else how long has that been now

72
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:52,959
has that been a year has it been two

73
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:54,400
years uh that I've been making the

74
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,319
recyclers yeah that you've been on this

75
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,640
sort of innovative cuz I've seen they

76
00:02:56,318 --> 00:03:01,199
started out as cubes Tri uh yeah close

77
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:02,719
to year a little last I'd say eight

78
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:05,000
months now oh so you've done all of

79
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:07,120
those design cubes and it's just trying

80
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,318
to find the best ones that the ones that

81
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,080
function the best and they slowly

82
00:03:09,318 --> 00:03:12,719
progress into these ones I find you can

83
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:15,840
hit these ones the hardest you don't get

84
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:17,598
any splashback few of the other ones you

85
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,719
you have to start them a little slower

86
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:22,479
you still function 100% but you got to

87
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:23,840
just kind of Kickstart it mhm no for me

88
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:25,639
that's a major point kickart then you

89
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,719
can haul as hard as you want but these

90
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:29,158
ones you can hit right off the bat hard

91
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:30,639
I remember the Kickstart one that you

92
00:03:29,158 --> 00:03:33,039
had the one where like pull it just kind

93
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:34,438
of gentle get it in there and then start

94
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:36,639
yeah I was like oh that's kind of

95
00:03:34,438 --> 00:03:38,560
different I find with the Eternal drain

96
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:40,279
it's too close to the perk and it wants

97
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,239
to if you hit too hard it'll want to

98
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,318
suck the water up the center right

99
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,519
before it starts to go around well

100
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:47,438
that's one of the things I love about

101
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,239
both you and Stratus is you know

102
00:03:47,438 --> 00:03:50,919
obviously all glass blowers are on the

103
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:52,519
hustle they got to blow glass they got

104
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:54,958
to be on their torch they're not working

105
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:56,920
other jobs they're blowing glass so I

106
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,199
understand that Hustle but I also have a

107
00:03:56,919 --> 00:04:01,158
deep respect for and I always take it

108
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:04,199
back to Jason Lee who was always very

109
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:05,878
obsessed how they how they felt when he

110
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:08,399
put water in them and and pulled through

111
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:10,158
them that Rumble and it had to be proper

112
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,959
the hand fill it's the visuals it's

113
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:13,359
everything absolutely I love these ones

114
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:16,600
cuz they're just the're the most

115
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,879
comfiest grip in your hand yeah like

116
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,879
your little guy said right it's like a

117
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:21,879
handle Dad yeah you can almost use these

118
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:23,439
like a cup and drink out of them yeah

119
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:24,759
they're absolutely spectacular like I

120
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:26,639
said you know one of the things that I

121
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:29,240
appreciate about both you and Stratus is

122
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,360
that you Contin you don't find something

123
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,840
to do

124
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,160
and then just do it over and over and

125
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:35,599
over and over and over and over and over

126
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:37,600
again there's Innovation and change that

127
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,120
occurs in each aspect of it and I you

128
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,759
know as a as a fan of glass and smoking

129
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:44,680
and seeing new things I really really

130
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:47,240
really have an appreciation for for that

131
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:50,360
I mean I watched Stratus with a simple

132
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:52,319
little spinning marble turn into this

133
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:54,560
explosive idea that's like all right

134
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:57,159
serious that he doing yeah you know it's

135
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,720
it's it's very cool to see and the fact

136
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:01,280
that you guys are both just right across

137
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,680

looking forward to it for sure yeah I'm

164
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,720
pretty sure my buddy Pete is from London

165
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,759
he's got a shop called Shakedown Street

166
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:04,039
yeah I know Pete yeah he's I've know

167
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:06,120
I've known Pete for 20 20 plus years so

168
00:06:04,038 --> 00:06:07,800
uh yeah he used to be good close friends

169
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,000
with uh with friends of mine over here

170
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:13,918
the breeder Steve organic traveler is he

171
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,360
not exactly yeah before that the NYPD

172
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:17,598
yeah NYPD yeah I was like what that's a

173
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:20,479
weird

174
00:06:17,598 --> 00:06:22,360
uh name so tell me a little bit about

175
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:24,399
the uh inspiration for this I mean it's

176
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,120
obviously substantially different from

177
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:30,439
the other three pieces on the table uh

178
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:32,598
yeah this was uh my inspiration for

179
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:35,879
uh the DFO piece that I was going to

180
00:06:32,598 --> 00:06:37,038
make I had a hard time just kind of what

181
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:38,918
am I going to make that's going to be

182
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:41,680
the nicest that I can actually make in

183
00:06:38,918 --> 00:06:44,318
the the short one day 12 hours that we

184
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,319
had MH and uh the hummingbird was one

185
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,840
that I could come up up with it was a

186
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:51,479
good theme that was relatively easy

187
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:53,799
enough to make in that time frame well

188
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:55,959
relatively easy is it wasn't as worked

189
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:58,160
as this one right definitely not it

190
00:06:55,959 --> 00:07:01,359
didn't have any of the rello or anything

191
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,080
and the were just flared open cut so

192
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,479
there was some shortcuts that I took for

193
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:07,959
the original piece that I was going to

194
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:09,758
make and uh yeah I just I haven't seen

195
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:11,799
anybody make the hummingbird feater so

196
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:15,199
it's dude it is kind of like an on

197
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:18,079
Tapped uh re or Avenue to go down so

198
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,360
fully Bravo I'm telling you it's uh this

199
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:21,199
is what it's all about you know a lot of

200
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,680
these these glass blowers and I know

201
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:26,160
that they it pains them because there's

202
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,478
it's techniques you need to be learned

203
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,199
these techniques glass blowing was

204
00:07:27,478 --> 00:07:30,680
always passed on from from Master to

205
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,038
student student it's not like a student

206
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:34,639
just decided he was going to be a glass

207
00:07:32,038 --> 00:07:36,360
Bower these things were passed on and so

208
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,240
now we have this community that is very

209
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:41,479
scared of being jacked of being bitten

210
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,918
of being you know taken for their

211
00:07:41,478 --> 00:07:46,478
techniques and their unique things that

212
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:48,839
they're creating and I see you in

213
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:50,478
particular always you know like you do

214
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:51,758
these e the excellent Line work the

215
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:53,240
things that you have learned from the

216
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,120
glass blowers that you have learned from

217
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:58,879
you represent them beautifully and I can

218
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:00,680
see how you know in the glass blowing

219
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,400
world that's a point of contention with

220
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:05,680
some artists they're like they have no

221
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:07,719
problem um charging for a class and

222
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,918
teaching these techniques but then they

223
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:11,599
also kind of have no problem being a

224
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:14,038
little bit pissed off when some of the

225
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:15,759
people are using techniqu just went out

226
00:08:14,038 --> 00:08:17,719
and taught well and it's it's a tough

227
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,319
thing to see sometimes the student

228
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:22,360
surpass the master or the student do so

229
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,800
well that it's kind of like throws the

230
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:26,680
the teacher off a little bit but uh and

231
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,560
I give you guys props you definitely

232
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:32,240
like this hummingbird feeder go with it

233
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:34,399
it is a good style it's it's amazing

234
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,320
dude and I mean the the little birds

235
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,958
turning them into dabbers and stuff like

236
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,320
it's just too much it's just the quality

237
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:42,239
of it is really on point as you guys

238
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,600
will be able to see from the photography

239

00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,839
to have all these years maybe another

252
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:16,079
time you know Vancouver could really use

00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,000
something like this yeah you could for

254
00:09:16,078 --> 00:09:20,278
sure Boro and Beyond has been talking

255

about doing a group show with us all so

256
00:09:20,278 --> 00:09:24,399

well I mean you guys have the talent

258
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:29,440

259
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:31,439
kind of silly not to Glass events are so

260
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,240

262
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,000
a couple of great ones with marble

263
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,519
Slinger the degenerate art and the

264
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,039
regenerate art epic historical shows but

265
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,440
there was the Melting Pot show in San

266
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:46,039
Francisco prior to that uh there's been

267
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,320
shows at uh goosefire there's been shows

268
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:49,879
at a variety of galleries around North

269
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,480
America and of course the damp cran

270
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:53,679
Gallery in Amsterdam I've been to some

271
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,440
wonderful shows there as well it's it's

272
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:57,919
just a nice thing for our community to

273
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,000
have access to to get us out of this I'm

274
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:02,199
always looking to get Canabis more

275
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,360
normalized cannabis use more normalized

276
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:07,959
and to me super high-end functional art

277
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,560
plays a very important role in bringing

278
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:12,599
a group of people who would maybe

279
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:15,078
otherwise not be as into this culture as

280
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:18,519
we are with with something like this

281
00:10:15,078 --> 00:10:21,120
like I I can guarantee you that this

282
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:22,720
could be sold to a collector without

283
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,879
them having any knowledge that it's a

284
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,399
pipe whatsoever and still being super

285
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:29,439
stoked on it and literally hanging it

286
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:31,278
for you know for for enjoyment it's it's

287

294
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,600
show yeah that's always nice always nice

295
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:49,919
when the collector comes in and purchas

296
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,759
and then offers uh I always did that I'm

297
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:54,159
not going to lie and it was always hard

298
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:56,919
with someone like Marcel who was always

299
00:10:54,159 --> 00:11:01,240
like uh I'd be like you take the first

300
00:10:56,919 --> 00:11:01,240
hit and he'd be like no you take it

301
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:05,919
like

302
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:07,518
okay but Slinger took it a few times

303
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:09,319
he's like yeah I'll do that yeah I'll

304
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,720
take that hit yeah it's like damn

305
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,920

00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:19,000
to have a great show I think looking

309
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:21,160
forward to it it's going to be good to

310
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,480
be back in Ontario it's been a long yeah

311
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:26,039
it's the old stomping ground right yeah

312
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:29,600
it is very

313
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:32,078
cool let's get that going

314
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,079
carbed

315
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:40,039
up yeah I'm uh very very stoked to see

316
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:41,719
this glass I wish that it was a sunnier

317
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:43,399
day and I could get the most epic photos

318
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:45,839
of it it's pretty cloudy but we've got

319
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:47,559
some pretty good white bright light out

320
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:50,200
there if I photograph it from the right

321
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:51,919
angle uh I should be able my main factor

322
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:54,000
in photographing glass like this is

323
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:56,479
doing it justice doing the artist

324
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,958

sometimes when the pictures aren't very

328
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:06,399
saw a vice article recently where I

329
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:08,759
think it was about a glass

330
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:11,159
blow yeah it was about some guy I blow

331

$100,000 glass pipes or something and I

332
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:14,319
didn't even recognize his name I was

333
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:16,078
kind of like what but the pictures

334
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,480
literally looked like they were taken in

335
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:21,319
1980 by someone who was drunk at a party

336
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:24,120
like they were all out of focus if he

337
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:26,639

338

hear people say CBD has a cherry flavor

353
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,560
it's actually High CBD cultivars have a

354
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:10,159
cherry flavored tpine profile would be a

355
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:10,159
more accurate wave of saying

356
00:13:21,198 --> 00:13:27,039
it oh yeah that's what I'm talking about

357

359
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:31,958

definitely try to do so if you can do a

363
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:40,159
5 to 10 minute live stream that would be

364
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,800
amazing um I'll share it on my social

365
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:44,159

00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:49,879
you that aren't able to make it to be

369
