6:30 to drive my daughter to work this

72
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:18,930

00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:22,680
you drive them to work their work is

74
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:28,680

about GE nah man just enjoying it

83
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:56,939
beautiful Sunday morning starting to get

84
00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:58,919
cold out here so nice catch any fish

85
00:03:56,939 --> 00:04:00,060
they overthrew spear fishing equipment

86
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:03,509
in the background there

87
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:05,129
all right had that got the room you know

88
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:06,209
as I went a couple weeks ago but the

89
00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:08,280
weather was kind of late in the season

90
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:10,009
the weather was rough probably have to

91
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,969
wait to start going to Mexico in January

92
00:04:10,009 --> 00:04:13,609
me my wife will be going out there a

93
00:04:11,969 --> 00:04:17,970
pony will be blown out there and

94
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:21,579
enjoying the water all right beautiful

95
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:23,110
400 people watching at 9:05

96
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:24,639
pretty good still getting that

97
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:26,229
reverberation through your mic a little

98
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,900
bit do you have any headphones that

99
00:04:26,228 --> 00:04:30,818
might help sometimes sometimes our

100
00:04:28,899 --> 00:04:33,008
speakers are really close to our

101
00:04:30,819 --> 00:04:34,360
microphone and that also creates a

102
00:04:33,009 --> 00:04:35,889
little bit of a problem but don't worry

103
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:39,550
we'll figure it out

104
00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:42,490
worst case scenario oh geez Jordan Jie

105
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:44,319
asks me why never breeder Steve alright

106
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:46,360
I'll put it out there breeder Steve has

107
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:48,158
been a longtime friend of mine the

108
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,530
reason you don't see him on hash search

109
00:04:48,158 --> 00:04:53,589
is because I think he may have lost his

110
00:04:50,529 --> 00:04:57,579
mind apparently me being friends with

111
00:04:53,589 --> 00:05:01,060
Ryan Lee ie chimera genetics has been

112
00:04:57,579 --> 00:05:03,519
enough for him to say that we can no

113
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:05,319
longer be friends so he's on the Twitter

114
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:08,258
late at night may be under the influence

115
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:10,270
of alcohol and I think that that could

116
00:05:08,259 --> 00:05:12,340
be the problem there so we wish the best

117
00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:15,250
for Steve one day maybe he'll his

118
00:05:12,339 --> 00:05:17,679
alcohol dementia will dissipate and

119
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:19,658
he'll be able to join us back in the

120
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,918
cannabis community where we're we're

121
00:05:19,658 --> 00:05:22,300
nice to each other and where we don't

122
00:05:20,918 --> 00:05:25,180
treat each other like high schoolers

123
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:27,819
we're oh if you like that person I'm

124
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:29,408
unable to be your friend last time I

125
00:05:27,819 --> 00:05:31,900
really experienced that was in high

126
00:05:29,408 --> 00:05:34,079
school didn't like it then don't like it

127
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:38,049
now and that's sort of the short of it

128
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:41,318
so I hope everyone can understand that

129
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:43,509
Oh Steve is curling the seed is curling

130
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:46,930

00:06:20,788 --> 00:06:26,439
remember we were talking I had some bug

141
00:06:22,899 --> 00:06:29,109
issues and I was really bumming in so I

142
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:30,610
ripped out both halves I have three

143
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:32,500
parts in my greenhouse and I ripped out

144
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:35,420
the two sides that were affected I just

145
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:36,829
went drastic action did a heat treatment

146
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:39,890

151
00:06:48,019 --> 00:06:56,539
plants blowing in the background in

152
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:57,220
front of your fan they're holed up for

153
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:02,480

154
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:04,880

155
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:07,370

156
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:08,990
Josh and Kelly sort of walk everyone

157
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:10,699
through doing a little introduction

158
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:12,889
there's definitely most of you I know

159
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:14,810

161
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:19,759
full crew in here we'll go through that

162
00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:22,789
and do that and in the meantime geez

163
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:26,269
what's happened in Canada since last we

164
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:29,480
spoke oh yeah they apparently legalized

165
00:07:26,269 --> 00:07:30,409
cannabis now I can already hear so many

166
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:33,530
of you bitching

167
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:35,420
oh it's prohibition 2.0 it's this it's

168
00:07:33,529 --> 00:07:37,009
that yes correct there's all sorts of

169
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:39,740
problems with it there's all sorts of

170
00:07:37,009 --> 00:07:41,420
work to be done but had I told you 20

171
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:44,000
years ago that this day would be coming

172
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:45,410
many many many many people would have

173
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,290
not acknowledged that it was a

174
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:51,020
possibility we've waited for this art

175
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:53,629
group for 20 plus 30 plus years groups

176
00:07:51,019 --> 00:07:55,159
like Sam's for 40 50 plus years and

177
00:07:53,629 --> 00:07:58,730
other groups of people that are even

178
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:59,840
older for 60 to 70 plus years so we've

179
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:02,030
been waiting for this for a while and

180
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:04,969
although it's not ideal it's not the

181
00:08:02,029 --> 00:08:06,469
perfect scenario and I hate to compare

182
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:08,240
it to alcohol because what a terrible

183
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:11,330
comparison but when alcohol prohibition

184
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,490
ended bars did not pop up on every

185
00:08:11,329 --> 00:08:14,899
street I believe it was 20 years before

186
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:17,240
you could put a sign in your window that

187
00:08:14,899 --> 00:08:19,759
said beer sold here it was also kind of

188
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:22,910
a slow sort of thing I hope cannabis is

189
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:25,399
faster but the bottom line is it's not

190
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:27,230
really ideal for the community of people

191
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:30,649
that have been pushing cannabis for all

192
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:34,340
these years who it is ideal for is the

193
00:08:30,649 --> 00:08:37,129
other 95% of the population who is now

194
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:39,590
gaining access who otherwise did not

195
00:08:37,129 --> 00:08:40,879
have access so for them it's great for

196
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:42,860
the rest of us we're going to continue

197
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:45,289
to fight the fight we need our edibles

198
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:48,200
we need our concentrates we need no THC

199
00:08:45,289 --> 00:08:48,819
or cannabinoid limitations we need

200
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,650
access

201
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:52,540
more than just government operated

202
00:08:50,649 --> 00:08:54,459
stores obviously we want dispensaries

203
00:08:52,539 --> 00:08:57,370
and of course we still have the ability

204
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:59,050
to grow cannabis a couple provinces

205
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:01,000
Manitoba in Quebec I believe are trying

206
00:08:59,049 --> 00:09:03,579
to keep people from growing there for

207
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,169
allotted plants that everyone now in the

208
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:07,480
country is basically allowed to grow

209
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:09,909
federally under this new legalization

210
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:12,159
regime and of course they're still gonna

211
00:09:09,909 --> 00:09:14,439
try and pull funds out the police are

212
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:16,240
still pulling funds out to do you know

213
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:18,490
to to do enforcement whether that

214
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,379
enforcement is now you know I saw people

215
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:22,419
like oh look now they're giving tickets

216
00:09:20,379 --> 00:09:24,429
and I was just like wow like I would

217
00:09:22,419 --> 00:09:26,169
have [ __ ] loved to ticket you know

218
00:09:24,429 --> 00:09:28,479
twenty years ago instead of having all

219
00:09:26,169 --> 00:09:31,120
my pot taken and being arrested and

220
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:34,300
thrown in a cage but oh how soon we

221
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:36,669
forget and I understand that I don't

222
00:09:34,299 --> 00:09:38,229
know if many of you guys are from Canada

223
00:09:36,669 --> 00:09:41,039
I think you guys are all probably from

224
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:44,200
the US and Sam they're in Amsterdam aka

225
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:46,839
via the US but you can understand that

226
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:49,330
federally legalizing cannabis is gonna

227
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:51,250
be a good move I hear so many people

228
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:52,930
complaining and I understand that

229
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:54,399
because they've been you know paying

230
00:09:52,929 --> 00:09:56,679
their mortgages and all their bills with

231
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:59,199
cannabis prohibition prices for so long

232
00:09:56,679 --> 00:10:01,239
and I get that you know having that

233
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,450
transfer over into a government regime

234
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:05,440
you know sort of sucks in a big way but

235
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:07,660
being able to grow our own cannabis

236
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:10,300
being able to give access to cannabis to

237
00:10:07,659 --> 00:10:13,689
people who are not in our community to

238
00:10:10,299 --> 00:10:16,929
me is a win-win so I just wanted to get

239
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:22,180
that off my chest and welcome to the new

240
00:10:16,929 --> 00:10:24,939

243
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:33,040
area humble area what's happening in

244
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:36,460
Cali hey hey y'all it's good to be on

245
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:38,709
here it's good to see your faces so yeah

246
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:41,500
we're in the Redwood Valley sort of

247
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:44,889
appellation of Mendo and you know

248
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:47,580
speaking of Appalachians we got a lot

249
00:10:44,889 --> 00:10:51,789
going on with that in terms of you know

250
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:55,030
okay yeah son grown but you know how was

251
00:10:51,789 --> 00:10:58,360
it grown was it grown like we have that

252
00:10:55,029 --> 00:11:01,029
sort of connection to the place you know

253
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,590
with Callie coming online you know we

254
00:11:01,029 --> 00:11:05,769
definitely seen a lot of shifts and

255
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:08,680
terms of you know how how people like

256
00:11:05,769 --> 00:11:11,319
want to connect with the farmers we're

257
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:15,809
really grateful to a dispensary soulful

258
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:18,490
who loves telling the farmers story and

259
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:20,349
you know they love to talk to share our

260
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:23,440
certifications like the Dragonfly

261
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:27,159
certification and educating consumers

262
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:29,770
has been a real a really big and

263
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:32,909
important step and like you said Marcus

264
00:11:29,769 --> 00:11:37,029
I think it is good for a larger

265
00:11:32,909 --> 00:11:39,339
population to get access to cannabis and

266
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:42,339
I think in the bigger picture that's for

267
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:45,759
the best and then having us with educate

268
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:47,649
with education and such to just sort of

269
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:53,649
slowly build that is great

270
00:11:47,649 --> 00:11:55,449
area okay Josh how do you feel that you

271
00:11:53,649 --> 00:11:57,549
know the education has sort of helped

272
00:11:55,450 --> 00:12:01,629
you you all know forward or at least has

273
00:11:57,549 --> 00:12:04,449
a voice in the industry you know people

274
00:12:01,629 --> 00:12:06,279
want to know where their cannabis is

275
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:09,460
coming from they want to know like the

276
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:12,669
farmers story they want to even you know

277
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:15,090
eat our food and and come see the farm

278
00:12:12,669 --> 00:12:18,789
you know our farm is relatively

279
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:22,000
accessible and we've had so many folks

280
00:12:18,789 --> 00:12:24,519
come and and want to learn and and put

281
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,429
their hands in the soil and see the the

282
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:29,649
worms and the life and you know pick a

283
00:12:27,429 --> 00:12:31,809
cucumber or some kale like while they're

284
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:36,370
smoking the cannabis that was grown

285
00:12:31,809 --> 00:12:39,119
right next to it and and yeah yeah it's

286
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:41,259
a beautiful thing you know we've really

287
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,480
you know we've been lucky to have like I

288
00:12:41,259 --> 00:12:47,159
said places like soulful and other shops

289
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:49,149
really you know encouraging it and

290
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:54,069
encouraging us to continue doing what we

291
00:12:49,149 --> 00:12:55,299
do nice one that sounds that sounds

292
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:57,070
awesome and that's something that you

293
00:12:55,299 --> 00:12:59,589
know we're looking at up here and up

294
00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:01,720
here in Canada you know in different

295
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:06,460
places where the farm isn't necessarily

296
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:08,560
on the packaging nowadays you know it's

297
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:10,060
the packaging looks quite different than

298
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:12,159
what you know you would think is

299
00:13:10,059 --> 00:13:14,739
packaging and stuff so we're trying to

300
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:16,059
figure out ways to you know keep farmers

301
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:18,279
in the loop

302
00:13:16,059 --> 00:13:19,149
up here as well so that's part of the

303
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:21,850
reason why we're having this

304
00:13:19,149 --> 00:13:23,649
conversation today is to see what

305
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:25,240
everyone's kind of going through with in

306
00:13:23,649 --> 00:13:26,500
their laws and within their

307
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,450
jurisdictions and within their

308
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:30,700
limitations to see how we may be able to

309
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:33,430
create some congruent language and

310
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:34,629
everything so yeah we really appreciate

311
00:13:33,429 --> 00:13:37,299
what you're saying there we know that

312
00:13:34,629 --> 00:13:39,789
soulful is amazing and Eli down there

313
00:13:37,299 --> 00:13:41,829
and and there's some really good you

314
00:13:39,789 --> 00:13:43,419
know distributors that you all are

315
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:46,300
working with and they're extremely

316
00:13:43,419 --> 00:13:48,490
important too so yeah that's sweet maybe

317
00:13:46,299 --> 00:13:50,199
we can let me what we'll do now is we'll

318
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:55,539
do a quick check-in with everyone and

319
00:13:50,200 --> 00:14:00,490
then we'll do like a more open dialog my

328
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,539
like you guys I guess but we feel like

329
00:14:37,929 --> 00:14:42,069
we're on an island like a non corporate

330
00:14:40,539 --> 00:14:46,389
Island because there's so many

331
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:48,850
independent farmers that came out of the

332
00:14:46,389 --> 00:14:51,639
black market and into the white market

333
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:54,909
that didn't really have any of those

334
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:58,179
connections before and now are making

335
00:14:54,909 --> 00:15:00,899
those connections it's nice to have

336
00:14:58,179 --> 00:15:04,269
people that are ambitious and and

337
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:07,319
motivated to make that transition to be

338
00:15:04,269 --> 00:15:09,789
like a community to be a community so I

339
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:15,420
mean that's the biggest asset that I

340
00:15:09,789 --> 00:15:20,339
have is community is really the strong

341
00:15:15,419 --> 00:15:24,399
you know non contract non non corporate

342
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:27,490
community of small farmers to just vent

343
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:30,419
and dialogue and and see where they're

344
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:33,250
going and find out

345
00:15:30,419 --> 00:15:36,009
where those points are where those touch

346
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:39,100
points that make it possible for the

347
00:15:36,009 --> 00:15:42,610
small farm to exist and then at the same

348
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:44,879
time just being involved in the

349
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:47,830
community and helping this community

350
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:51,519
evolve because everybody's having every

351
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:54,009
issue that I'm having I know that all my

352
00:15:51,519 --> 00:16:00,059
neighbors are having the same issue so

353
00:15:54,009 --> 00:16:03,309
being open to to other people's struggle

354
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:04,809
it's similar I wanted to kind of open up

355
00:16:03,309 --> 00:16:07,629
something you said there in regards to

356
00:16:04,809 --> 00:16:10,149
the non corporate you know or versus the

357
00:16:07,629 --> 00:16:12,399
corporate I I myself have a corporation

358
00:16:10,149 --> 00:16:15,399
it's called fresh head ease and when I

359
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:17,860
started it oh the seed the seed is is

360
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:21,429
folding when I started fresh Hattie's in

361
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:23,139
1999 I don't know why or how I knew it

362
00:16:21,429 --> 00:16:25,419
was probably this book that I had read

363
00:16:23,139 --> 00:16:27,129
called the passport report involved in

364
00:16:25,419 --> 00:16:28,659
how to start international business

365
00:16:27,129 --> 00:16:30,820
corporations and how to do business

366
00:16:28,659 --> 00:16:32,709
around the world without you know making

367
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:34,840
missteps and being crushed and what I

368
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:37,389
mean by that is particularly in the US

369
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:39,070
where you can be sued if you run your

370
00:16:37,389 --> 00:16:42,009
business and it's not as a corporation

371
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:43,870
saying here in Canada and you come into

372
00:16:42,009 --> 00:16:47,409
some problems like I for instance had a

373
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:49,840
lawsuit with Reinhart Delp who I guess

374
00:16:47,409 --> 00:16:52,449
had a patent for water extraction he had

375
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:55,540
showed Mila the isolator woman his

376
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:57,370
machine and she kind of you know instead

377
00:16:55,539 --> 00:17:00,399
of selling his machine she jacked the

378
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:01,960
idea and my current manufacturer and a

379
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:04,359
friend of mine Eldon actually came up

380
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:06,660
with the concept of the first isolator

381
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:09,189
bags I of course went to sell the bags

382
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:11,560
formula we had a kind of a falling out

383
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:14,110
and I ended up making my own bags not

384
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:15,759
really knowing the Rhinehart story but

385
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:18,189
luckily what I had done was I had

386
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:20,680
created a corporation for myself to

387
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:22,600
operate my business under and that

388
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:26,339
really saved me in a sense because when

389
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:29,289
I got sued by Reinhardt some years later

390
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:30,730
he was suing my corporation and only the

391
00:17:29,289 --> 00:17:32,920
things that were under the umbrella of

392
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:35,890
my corporation were allowed to be sued

393
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:38,110
it meant that my home and all of my

394
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:39,790
families you know my my university

395
00:17:38,109 --> 00:17:41,319
trusts for my kids and all of these

396
00:17:39,789 --> 00:17:44,019
things that I had set up they were

397
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:46,418
protected by this Court

398
00:17:44,019 --> 00:17:49,058
so whenever I hear corporation or

399
00:17:46,419 --> 00:17:50,980
corporate you know the motto said in a

400
00:17:49,058 --> 00:17:52,450
negative way because we all think of

401
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:55,149
like a corporation as like you know

402
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:57,788
Monsanto this big evil corporation I

403
00:17:55,148 --> 00:17:59,558
also think like man like bubble bags has

404
00:17:57,788 --> 00:18:01,960
been a corporation for almost 20 years

405
00:17:59,558 --> 00:18:03,579
and I wonder I wonder if that's a bad

406
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:05,319
thing or a good thing or is it how you

407
00:18:03,579 --> 00:18:07,509
direct your corporation that makes it

408
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:10,388
bad or good or do we imply that if we

409
00:18:07,509 --> 00:18:12,519
incorporate we have become the machine

410
00:18:10,388 --> 00:18:13,898
we have we have we have assimilated into

411
00:18:12,519 --> 00:18:17,440
this machine I would love to hear your

412
00:18:13,898 --> 00:18:19,119
guys's thoughts on that in regards to do

413
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,490
we protect ourselves do we protect our

414
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:23,528
families by incorporating or do we just

415
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:26,230
sort of leave that to the side and hope

416
00:18:23,528 --> 00:18:29,048
that no one sues us for everything that

417
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:30,970
we've tried to tried to create and earn

418
00:18:29,048 --> 00:18:32,168
over the years because I could have you

419
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:34,419
know in my lawsuit

420
00:18:32,169 --> 00:18:36,610
I could have potentially lost everything

421
00:18:34,419 --> 00:18:39,460
had it not been a corporation and had I

422
00:18:36,609 --> 00:18:41,199
not been an actual human being because

423
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:43,870
in the end what we did was we asked the

424
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:47,440
mouthpieces that's my nickname for

425
00:18:43,869 --> 00:18:49,000
lawyers to sort of stand aside and let

426
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,850
us communicate and when I started

427
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,710
communicating with Reinhart I found out

428
00:18:51,849 --> 00:18:55,658
that he was just a human being and that

429
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:58,000
I was a human being that that he had

430
00:18:55,659 --> 00:19:01,629
been wronged that the that the isolator

431
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:04,359
bags were in fact created based on his

432
00:19:01,628 --> 00:19:07,119
machine the ice-cold extractor and the

433
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:09,908
bubble bags being a takeoff of the

434
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:11,469
isolator bags were then in breach of

435
00:19:09,909 --> 00:19:13,778
this man's patent and I ended up

436
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:15,788
settling with him and paying him a good

437
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:17,230
chunk of money and feeling kind of good

438
00:19:15,788 --> 00:19:19,000
about that being one of only a few

439
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:21,099
companies worldwide that makes these

440
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,898
water extraction bags but I put some

441
00:19:21,099 --> 00:19:26,158
money into Ryan Hart's pocket because

442
00:19:22,898 --> 00:19:29,138
because it was the right thing to do I

443
00:19:26,159 --> 00:19:32,230
mean from my perspective it is the wrong

444
00:19:29,138 --> 00:19:43,928
term the corporate is just a legal

445
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:47,589
entity it was independent small natural

446
00:19:43,929 --> 00:19:50,889
food businesses and seventies network of

447
00:19:47,589 --> 00:19:53,528
these independent businesses and then

448
00:19:50,888 --> 00:19:56,899
small distributors that were regional

449
00:19:53,528 --> 00:19:58,640
that would bring food

450
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:01,930
these independence' was a really an

451
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:05,270
independent business network that then

452
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:08,900
United Natural Foods and Whole Foods and

453
00:20:05,269 --> 00:20:12,200
so these these you know investment

454
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:14,390
companies that could leverage large

455
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:18,440
amounts of public investment that then

456
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:20,840
put either bought out or put put the

457
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:24,610
small independent business out of

458
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:27,109
business that's what I mean is

459
00:20:24,609 --> 00:20:28,879
but isn't that something that naturally

460
00:20:27,109 --> 00:20:30,619
happens like that

461
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,570
for well I just think that it seems to

462
00:20:30,619 --> 00:20:35,419
be this natural human thing like a

463
00:20:32,569 --> 00:20:37,669
perfect example that I would use is the

464
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:40,130
mom-and-pop dealers let's let's think

465
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:42,440
about the mom-and-pop dealers across the

466
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:44,060
u.s. there's there with tens of

467
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:46,400
thousands of them these were people that

468
00:20:44,059 --> 00:20:47,659
deal dealt out of their homes they sold

469
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,390
to their friends they sold to their

470
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:50,930
families and when dispensaries came into

471
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:53,930
being

472
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:55,880
they literally crushed those mom-and-pop

473
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:57,740
dealers almost out of existence those

474
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:59,210
those mom-and-pop dealers were forced to

475
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:01,400
kind of wholesale their product to a

476
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:04,610
dispensary now because they weren't able

477
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:06,590
to like compete with the hours and the

478
00:21:04,609 --> 00:21:08,629
amount of product and the the

479
00:21:06,589 --> 00:21:10,909
opportunity that people had when they

480
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:12,950
went to a dispensary to pick from you

481
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:15,259
know a hundred different types of bud or

482
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:17,330
hashes or edibles or whatever it is and

483
00:21:15,259 --> 00:21:19,339
it's not talked about so much here in

484
00:21:17,329 --> 00:21:21,949
Canada we talked about how the LPS are

485
00:21:19,339 --> 00:21:24,139
sort of crushing the dispensaries out of

486
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:25,549
existence and the dispensaries are the

487
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:27,320
little guy now but we never talked about

488
00:21:25,549 --> 00:21:29,470
when the dispensaries were the big guys

489
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:32,359
coming to crush the little mom-and-pop

490
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:33,829
operations out of the dealing that they

491
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:35,569
were doing out of their homes because I

492
00:21:33,829 --> 00:21:37,609
remember the cannabis scenario twenty

493
00:21:35,569 --> 00:21:40,429
years ago here in Canada and there was a

494
00:21:37,609 --> 00:21:42,379
lot of these people helping pay their

495
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:44,360
mortgage and helping pay for their life

496
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:46,430
by selling herb and when the

497
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:48,469
dispensaries came in and some of these

498
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:50,960
dispensaries were doing 30 40 grand a

499
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:54,110
day well that was money that was taken

500
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,789
out from all of these little places and

501
00:21:54,109 --> 00:21:58,219
now I just see it happening on a bigger

502
00:21:55,789 --> 00:22:00,920
level it just seems to be is it this

503
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:03,769
evil corporation or is it this natural

504
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:06,019
thing that we do when we try to scale up

505
00:22:03,769 --> 00:22:08,779
and and give people access it's very

506
00:22:06,019 --> 00:22:09,430
hard to give access to people around the

507
00:22:08,779 --> 00:22:12,279
globe

508
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:14,470
on a grassroots level that's what I've

509
00:22:12,279 --> 00:22:16,420
noticed being a you know starting from

510
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:18,519
grassroots activism from being a HAMP

511
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:19,900
activist back in the day you know where

512
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:22,000
we were just like a small group in

513
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:23,470
Manitoba we were turning on you know

514
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,329
maybe a hundred or two hundred or a

515
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:28,690
thousand or two thousand people here and

516
00:22:25,329 --> 00:22:31,480
there but once it got and built into you

517
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:33,309
know the Manitoba harvest company that

518
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:34,960
my partner's started and we're selling

519
00:22:33,309 --> 00:22:37,029
in places like Whole Foods and and

520
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,529
Kriegers and safe ways and all over the

521
00:22:37,029 --> 00:22:40,240
all over these grocery stores now

522
00:22:38,529 --> 00:22:42,369
suddenly they were doing what they

523
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,870
wanted to do which was touching tens of

524
00:22:42,369 --> 00:22:46,239
thousands hundreds of thousands if not

525
00:22:43,869 --> 00:22:48,069
millions of people but then there's this

526
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,650
sort of thing that happens when you do

527
00:22:48,069 --> 00:22:53,649
that where you know do we lose do we do

528
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:56,080
we lose sight of the the roots that we

529
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:58,480
came from when our plant grows fifteen

530
00:22:56,079 --> 00:23:00,579
to twenty feet away from those roots and

531
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,680
you can you know the top bud cannot see

532
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:04,809
the roots and I sometimes wonder if

533
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:06,820
that's what's happening to us that we we

534
00:23:04,809 --> 00:23:08,950
can no longer see our roots as we grow

535
00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:10,689
and grow and grow and you know what's

536
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:12,279
the answer how do we Rick maintain

537
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:14,170
integrity how do we maintain our

538
00:23:12,279 --> 00:23:18,000
humaneness when we're operating under a

539
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:20,529
corporation which clearly has no soul

540
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,029
well I think I just want to comment like

541
00:23:20,529 --> 00:23:24,099
I think it's you're you're hitting it

542
00:23:22,029 --> 00:23:26,829
right on and pushing it's the scale

543
00:23:24,099 --> 00:23:29,799
rights mega versus what size is the

544
00:23:26,829 --> 00:23:32,279
corporation how big do we need how big

545
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:35,230
do we need a service do we need to be

546
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:37,869
you know the big corporation that serves

547
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:39,339
all what's the one the us foods or

548
00:23:37,869 --> 00:23:40,659
whatever that serves all the restaurants

549
00:23:39,339 --> 00:23:43,539
here in the states you know you see it

550
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:45,130
at the back of every restaurant Cisco do

551
00:23:43,539 --> 00:23:47,139
we need to be that scale or do we need

552
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:48,460
to be the scale of where like what you

553
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:51,040
were just talking about the dispensary

554
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:52,809
in town it was able to have 50 strains

555
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:55,839
you know in their store but they were

556
00:23:52,809 --> 00:23:57,339
also able to buy from you know five

557
00:23:55,839 --> 00:24:00,039
years ago in Washington they were able

558
00:23:57,339 --> 00:24:02,679
to buy from small smallish mom-and-pop

559
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:04,869
growers that were growing 8 10 20 lights

560
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:06,850
and they were doing exactly that they

561
00:24:04,869 --> 00:24:08,229
were making a hundred grand a year 60

562
00:24:06,849 --> 00:24:10,119
grand a year taking care of their

563
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:12,610
families and putting more money into the

564
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:15,129
people the people's pockets and like as

565
00:24:12,609 --> 00:24:17,799
it scales up just like our food system

566
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:19,990
did over the whatever amount of time you

567
00:24:17,799 --> 00:24:21,849
know it it's not even corporations

568
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:22,960
because a lot of our food farms are our

569
00:24:21,849 --> 00:24:25,119
sole proprietors or

570
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:27,429
they're owned by individual families and

571
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:29,678
they're just massive and that's the

572
00:24:27,429 --> 00:24:32,559
problem is there's too much money going

573
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:35,500
into one entity and not being spread

574
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:36,970
evenly amongst the populace you know so

575
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:39,490
that's kind of that's my thoughts on it

576
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:40,990
we could somehow and the cannabis is a

577
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:42,788
really good opportunity I've been saying

578
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:44,769
this forever to like rewrite the rules

579
00:24:42,788 --> 00:24:47,220
and it could really affect food and

580
00:24:44,769 --> 00:24:50,288
business you know if we could somehow

581
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:52,089
harness ourselves and not become you

582
00:24:50,288 --> 00:24:53,648
know these big brands I won't call

583
00:24:52,089 --> 00:24:56,379
anyone out but you know not become these

584
00:24:53,648 --> 00:24:59,678
huge Nike brands that you know have

585
00:24:56,380 --> 00:25:01,120
swish symbols etc that the people all

586
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:03,100
you know they have you end up doing

587
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:04,898
distribution chains and growing weed in

588
00:25:03,099 --> 00:25:07,269
California and sending it to North

589
00:25:04,898 --> 00:25:10,209
Carolina and I like give me a break

590
00:25:07,269 --> 00:25:13,240
you know I feel yeah I feel especially

591
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:14,890
from a farming standpoint I mean you

592
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:17,470
know that that sort of farm-to-table

593
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:19,750
experience is just not something you're

594
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:21,909
gonna get even shopping at Whole Foods

595
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:24,429
and buying the seemingly nicest-looking

596
00:25:21,909 --> 00:25:25,899
and best product you can it's nothing

597
00:25:24,429 --> 00:25:27,990
compared to going to the farm

598
00:25:25,898 --> 00:25:31,239
so I'm caught in this dichotomy of

599
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:32,620
loving the idea of giving access to all

600
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:35,169
of the people that need it because let's

601
00:25:32,619 --> 00:25:37,989
be honest we all have great stash you

602
00:25:35,169 --> 00:25:39,880
know here in I'm puffing things both

603
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:41,859
medicinally and recreationally that I

604
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:43,840
constantly have this guilt over when

605
00:25:41,859 --> 00:25:44,949
people are like my four-year-old son has

606
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:47,109
a brain tumor what do I do

607
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:48,940
my lupus is killing me I need access to

608
00:25:47,109 --> 00:25:50,769
cannabis I live in Quebec I have no

609
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:52,360
access to cannabis and it's just this

610
00:25:50,769 --> 00:25:54,158
constant stories where I'm like okay

611
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:57,490
like I don't know how to get these

612
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:58,899
people access any other way than this

613
00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:02,730
model but I love what you're saying

614
00:25:58,898 --> 00:26:05,079
Joshua Joshua in regards to cannabis

615
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:07,179
changing the game up and we know that

616
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:09,220
cannabis has not you know it's been it's

617
00:26:07,179 --> 00:26:10,809
been segregated for all these years it's

618
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:13,839
been down in the basement locked away

619
00:26:10,808 --> 00:26:15,730
literally and now it's able to come back

620
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:17,589
out of the basement and I hope you know

621
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:20,319
I have faith in cannabis that it will be

622
00:26:17,589 --> 00:26:23,470
a guiding light that even corporations

623
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:25,178
that have nefarious sort of agendas are

624
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:27,130
going to be affected by this and I'll

625
00:26:25,179 --> 00:26:29,080
never forget my partner Martin merav

626
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:30,760
chick who was one of the founders of

627
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:32,980
Manitoba harvest and one of my original

628
00:26:30,759 --> 00:26:34,869
ham partners and and a good friend

629
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:37,120
saying to me when we planted our first

630
00:26:34,869 --> 00:26:39,339
hemp field in 1995

631
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:40,839
five acre field it was off the side of

632
00:26:39,339 --> 00:26:43,419
the highway and he said to me you know

633
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:45,519
what this is gonna change the way people

634
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:48,009
think I said what do you mean he said

635
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:49,839
just seeing this and being around this

636
00:26:48,009 --> 00:26:52,210
and the vibrational frequencies that are

637
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:55,659
coming off of these plants are going to

638
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:58,058
change the way people think and that was

639
00:26:55,660 --> 00:27:00,040
20 plus years ago 23 years ago and when

640
00:26:58,058 --> 00:27:01,629
I look at it now and although we have

641
00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:03,909
all of our little disagreements and

642
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:06,250
arguments about how it's playing out I

643
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:08,830
have to say it really has changed the

644
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:10,450
way people think it was step one in the

645
00:27:08,829 --> 00:27:12,759
changing of the way people think and I

646
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:15,240
think the last step in really sort of

647
00:27:12,759 --> 00:27:18,609
changing the way people think has been

648
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:20,410
has been these these these wonderful

649
00:27:18,609 --> 00:27:23,649
beautiful children who have acquired

650
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:25,269
sicknesses and have used cannabis to

651
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:28,179
help those sicknesses is that not the

652
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:30,099
last leg of prohibition standing right

653
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:32,530
there getting chopped down who's who's

654
00:27:30,099 --> 00:27:35,049
gonna argue against sick children it

655
00:27:32,529 --> 00:27:40,329
just seems like seems like we've come a

656
00:27:35,049 --> 00:27:43,019
long way we have to kind of tag back

657
00:27:40,329 --> 00:27:45,490
into the farmer farming analogy like

658
00:27:43,019 --> 00:27:47,639
technology really is helping us out and

659
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:49,839
you know coming from like an organic

660
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:52,030
regenerative standpoint often people

661
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:55,419
don't want to involve technology because

662
00:27:52,029 --> 00:27:58,678
it kind of has and has been fueled a lot

663
00:27:55,420 --> 00:28:01,570
of bad and misuse of fuel actual fuel

664
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:04,420
but I had the opportunity when I was in

665
00:28:01,569 --> 00:28:08,259
the Midwest years ago to work for an

666
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:10,210
aeroponic lettuce grow that was inside a

667
00:28:08,259 --> 00:28:12,970
warehouse in Minneapolis Minnesota and

668
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:15,279
it was a financial guy that started a

669
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:17,289
thing and the whole whole the whole

670
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:18,460
basis of it was it saved money you know

671
00:28:17,289 --> 00:28:20,079
so he wasn't coming at it from an

672
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:23,890
environmental standpoint but it was

673
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:25,839
cheaper to grow lettuce indoors in a

674
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:27,400
warehouse in Minnesota than it was to

675
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:30,189
grow it in California and ship it out

676
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:32,620
and I guess my point is that you know as

677
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:34,480
we are growing and in a community we

678
00:28:32,619 --> 00:28:36,879
really need to tap into the knowledge of

679
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:39,610
the technology and everything that's out

680
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:42,130
there not discard certain things so that

681
00:28:39,609 --> 00:28:45,719
we can you know produce locally produce

682
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:50,200
where we are and support our you know

683
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:50,980
our area hey Steve I wanted to hear a

684
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,960
little bit from

685
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:55,630
you you know you've gone from a small

686
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:58,110
grower to a really large corporation and

687
00:28:55,630 --> 00:29:01,240
had to jumped a lot of Hoops in Nevada

688
00:28:58,109 --> 00:29:03,250
you know what's your take on all of this

689
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:06,250
now that you've really really entered

690
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:08,470
sort of the corporate market and what

691
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:10,240
kind of you know good things have come

692
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:13,589
out of it and what kind of you know

693
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,589
difficulties have come out of it

694
00:29:16,769 --> 00:29:22,559
yeah I mean I wrestle the Beast every

695
00:29:19,769 --> 00:29:25,950
single day it's the struggles real as

696
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:28,169
far as that goes there's like a lot

697
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:30,480
catch-22s when it comes to to freeing

698
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:32,100
this plant and rescheduling it and and

699
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,950
do all the things that we talked about

700
00:29:32,099 --> 00:29:36,449
should be done for years example if we

701
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:39,269
reschedule this plant that's going to

702
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:42,660
open up in interstate commerce that's

703
00:29:39,269 --> 00:29:44,309
really going to drive big corporations

704
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:45,660
they're all gonna grow in one spot and

705
00:29:44,309 --> 00:29:48,119
ship it all over the world let alone

706
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:51,080
state to state so again like he kind of

707
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:53,099
gotta be careful what you ask for

708
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:55,169
but at the same time yeah that

709
00:29:53,099 --> 00:29:56,639
farm-to-table mom-and-pop shop everybody

710
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:58,440
wants that connection to the plant is

711
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,910
the plant is their connection to the

712
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:02,250
earth in a lot of ways to the soil in a

713
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:04,580
lot of ways so to just to remove the

714
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:06,450
farmer from the product like so many

715
00:30:04,579 --> 00:30:09,240
dispensaries here in Nevada have tried

716
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:11,610
is definitely the wrong approach I think

717
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:14,759
what you build your corporation off of

718
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:16,679
like example green life I try to to

719
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:18,450
build integrity into my company and you

720
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:20,430
know where we're indoors we're in Nevada

721
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:22,890
but we try to be sustainable as possible

722
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:25,710
considering what we're able to work with

723
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:26,610
and work around so I think if you do

724
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:29,430
things the right way for the right

725
00:30:26,609 --> 00:30:32,009
reasons you can have a corporations that

726
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:32,370
that's not necessarily the root of all

727
00:30:32,009 --> 00:30:34,109
evil

728
00:30:32,369 --> 00:30:35,699
you could be that shining light and

729
00:30:34,109 --> 00:30:38,279
actually bring you know I said bring

730
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:40,140
medicine to sick people in abundance

731
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:43,379
versus I know just serving your neighbor

732
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:44,610
and your friends so again I think it's a

733
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:46,440
double-edged sword I think you gotta be

734
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:48,719
careful how we play it I hope in 1020

735
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:50,580
years we look back and laugh at these

736
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,319
days that we made a plan you know you

737
00:30:50,579 --> 00:30:55,559
got to get a license to grow a plant to

738
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:56,759
help people but right now it's we're

739
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:58,589
trying to change the game a little bit

740
00:30:56,759 --> 00:31:00,619
you know you have all these very

741
00:30:58,589 --> 00:31:03,029
conservative people who've been

742
00:31:00,619 --> 00:31:05,369
brainwashed their entire lives I think

743
00:31:03,029 --> 00:31:08,430
this is a drug and now it's our duty to

744
00:31:05,369 --> 00:31:11,419
kind of and help educate them to the

745
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:14,640
right path so I think we're all

746
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:18,600
experienced in our own levels and keep

747
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:20,670
fighting the good fight wave so what's

748
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:22,319
going on with you Wade I know that the

749
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:24,090
struggle is real for you all too

750
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:26,879
especially for getting medicine out with

751
00:31:24,089 --> 00:31:29,250
the khalad Reyes Network you know really

752
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,990
being able to get medicine out to the

753
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:32,970
children it's one of the most

754
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:35,490
comparative missions that we have as

755
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:37,650
farmers and as cannabis growers and and

756
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:39,210
as activists so what's been going on

757
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:42,870
with you and your struggles and

758
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:46,230
successes thanks for inviting me in this

759
00:31:42,869 --> 00:31:50,579
morning yeah it's a very challenging

760
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:54,599
time for a lot of the reasons that have

761
00:31:50,579 --> 00:32:00,000
been spoken about here Oracle address

762
00:31:54,599 --> 00:32:03,269
Network pretty much bad news I should

763
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:09,420
say we put a lot of effort last year in

764
00:32:03,269 --> 00:32:11,730
California into getting a bill your mic

765
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:16,800
for a second yep it's coming through

766
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:19,380
strong yeah we've got a bill through the

767
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:22,529
legislature Senate bill 829 which would

768
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:26,190
have created a specific license type for

769
00:32:22,529 --> 00:32:28,559
compassionate use and a long story short

770
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:33,840
the governor vetoed it on the very last

771
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:37,309
day it was possible to do so and so the

772
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:42,959
collaterals network is underground

773
00:32:37,309 --> 00:32:45,769
free market entity again we were well on

774
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:49,140
our way to creating a not-for-profit

775
00:32:45,769 --> 00:32:52,019
foundation and some other activities

776
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:54,420
that would have allowed us to go forward

777
00:32:52,019 --> 00:32:58,920
under state law and now state law is

778
00:32:54,420 --> 00:33:01,830
back - it is illegal to donate or give

779
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:07,259
cannabis in any form especially to

780
00:33:01,829 --> 00:33:09,599
children so that's all I can really say

781
00:33:07,259 --> 00:33:10,980
about it I know that for myself some of

782
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:14,939
the families that I've helped over the

783
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:16,650
years what I'm doing what we're doing

784
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:19,440
right now in the cloud roots Network is

785
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:21,570
we're trying to put together packages

786
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:25,710
for all of the families that we've been

787
00:33:21,569 --> 00:33:28,289
helping and get them enough of the

788
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:31,980
products that they're using so that they

789
00:33:28,289 --> 00:33:35,099
are good for the coming year state law

790
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:39,900
allows our activity up until January 1st

791
00:33:35,099 --> 00:33:42,118
and so we're hustling pretty hard at the

792
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:44,249
moment to try and get together

793
00:33:42,118 --> 00:33:47,128
like I said whatever the family needs

794
00:33:44,249 --> 00:33:49,939
for the coming year in hopes that a year

795
00:33:47,128 --> 00:33:52,498
from now the Legislature will have

796
00:33:49,939 --> 00:33:57,449
passed a bill similar that allows

797
00:33:52,499 --> 00:33:59,009
compassionate use and the governor will

798
00:33:57,449 --> 00:34:01,679
sign it this time because it's a new

799
00:33:59,009 --> 00:34:04,439
governor coming and he's more friendly

800
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:09,179
to cannabis in his own way I think we'll

801
00:34:04,439 --> 00:34:11,429
see so it's kind of a challenging moment

802
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:12,838
if you will in the work of khalad Reyes

803
00:34:11,429 --> 00:34:15,960
Network and some of the families we've

804
00:34:12,838 --> 00:34:17,998
been helping to make it very specific I

805
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:19,259
know forest was invited to join us this

806
00:34:17,998 --> 00:34:22,348
morning

807
00:34:19,259 --> 00:34:28,740
Silas his son has been having a lot of

808
00:34:22,349 --> 00:34:31,528
trouble he's going through he's maturing

809
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:34,668
into a young man and all the hormonal

810
00:34:31,528 --> 00:34:38,088
changes are making for a very

811
00:34:34,668 --> 00:34:42,210
intractable situation I know on Friday

812
00:34:38,088 --> 00:34:45,480
Silas and Forrest were down at one of

813
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:48,898
the universities down in the Bay Area I

814
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:51,358
think to see a neurologist because he's

815
00:34:48,898 --> 00:34:53,998
Silas is back to having grand Mal's on a

816
00:34:51,358 --> 00:34:56,449
fairly regular basis with all kinds of

817
00:34:53,998 --> 00:35:00,480
other types of seizures mixed in and

818
00:34:56,449 --> 00:35:03,960
Forrest is completely overwhelmed by it

819
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:06,869
all the whole family is so that's that's

820
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:11,338
what's going on for clavius Network for

821
00:35:06,869 --> 00:35:14,369
me personally one of the problems with

822
00:35:11,338 --> 00:35:16,828
state law in California it is local

823
00:35:14,369 --> 00:35:21,358
jurisdictions have the authority to

824
00:35:16,829 --> 00:35:24,450
limit what the state allows and the

825
00:35:21,358 --> 00:35:27,929
state for example in my specific case

826
00:35:24,449 --> 00:35:30,568
allows me to grow six plants for my own

827
00:35:27,929 --> 00:35:33,449
personal use not for anyone else because

828
00:35:30,568 --> 00:35:35,400
I don't have a license and I can't get a

829
00:35:33,449 --> 00:35:38,788
license because my local jurisdiction

830
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:44,130
says my zoning and my property size and

831
00:35:38,789 --> 00:35:48,028
my setbacks are all wrong for any kind

832
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:51,059
of commercial cannabis activity and it's

833
00:35:48,028 --> 00:35:53,969
a problem that California as a state is

834
00:35:51,059 --> 00:35:55,980
trying to make laws that apply in a

835
00:35:53,969 --> 00:35:58,409
place like Los Angeles

836
00:35:55,980 --> 00:36:02,159
as that as well as a place like Nevada

837
00:35:58,409 --> 00:36:05,639
County Nevada County has almost as much

838
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:08,309
land mass as LA County but only a

839
00:36:05,639 --> 00:36:11,369
hundred thousand people and meantime LA

840
00:36:08,309 --> 00:36:13,980
County has like 10 million people so the

841
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:16,230
rules that work for indoor cultivation

842
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:19,170
which is the only real kind of

843
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:21,990
cultivation going on in Los Angeles make

844
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:23,760
no sense at all up here in Nevada County

845
00:36:21,989 --> 00:36:27,089
or any part of Northern California for

846
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:29,100
that matter so yeah

847
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:31,769
on my property I can have six plants but

848
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:34,710
I can only have them indoors which is

849
00:36:31,769 --> 00:36:36,960
such a huge joke on a regenerative farm

850
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:38,519
and I know that it's possible I could

851
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:42,630
practice regenerative agriculture

852
00:36:38,519 --> 00:36:48,840
indoors but to do it with six plants is

853
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:51,599
an insanely expensive and obnoxious

854
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:54,570
hobby if you will the environmental

855
00:36:51,599 --> 00:37:00,389
impacts of it for energy usage et cetera

856
00:36:54,570 --> 00:37:00,960
et cetera et cetera so I it's funny here

857
00:37:00,389 --> 00:37:03,420
we are

858
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:06,150
California's the model so to speak for

859
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:09,960
legalization and yet it's been done so

860
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:12,240
poorly that all up and down the state

861
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:16,860
even people who have temporary permits

862
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:19,199
are running into crazy situations one of

863
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:24,809
the DIMM family farms I won't mention

864
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:26,699
names had trouble with I believe it was

865
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:30,059
Fish and Game Department Fish and

866
00:37:26,699 --> 00:37:33,389
Wildlife came to their farm and even

867
00:37:30,059 --> 00:37:36,509
though the state water board and the

868
00:37:33,389 --> 00:37:39,289
CDFA and the local authorities had

869
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:42,240
signed off on their water usage plan

870
00:37:39,289 --> 00:37:45,420
Fish and Game Fish and Wildlife decided

871
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:47,339
they didn't like their thing and abated

872
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:49,380
their whole property took down all their

873
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:51,390
plants shut him down

874
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:53,760
and filed paperwork with the state that

875
00:37:51,389 --> 00:37:57,839
this cut that this particular licensee

876
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:59,790
was in violation of the law and so there

877
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:01,710
if it goes through the lis

878
00:37:59,789 --> 00:38:04,079
administrative things this got this farm

879
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:07,199
that was doing so much to try and comply

880
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:09,389
with all the rules because one of the

881
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:11,219
regulatory agencies that did

882
00:38:09,389 --> 00:38:13,699
agrees with a different regulatory

883
00:38:11,219 --> 00:38:16,049
agency that had already given approval

884
00:38:13,699 --> 00:38:18,419
they're going to be bei are in danger of

885
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:21,590
losing any opportunity to engage in kmac

886
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:24,360
cannabis activity for three years

887
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:26,210
because the regulatory agencies can't

888
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:28,829
agree with each other on what's allowed

889
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:33,199
so those kind of things are happening in

890
00:38:28,829 --> 00:38:36,630
California and it's really a sad story

891
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:38,429
the free market you know what we are

892
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:40,860
talking what you were mentioning Marcus

893
00:38:38,429 --> 00:38:43,319
about dispensaries and mom-and-pop

894
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:46,140
operations that have flourished in the

895
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:49,530
past and have been shut down quite a bit

896
00:38:46,139 --> 00:38:52,469
I think in California the free market

897
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:56,040
the non regulated market or free market

898
00:38:52,469 --> 00:38:58,109
as I like to call it is going to

899
00:38:56,039 --> 00:39:01,730
flourish over the next couple of years

900
00:38:58,110 --> 00:39:05,760
because for what it costs cultivators

901
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:08,490
nurseryman distributors processors just

902
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:11,640
on and on right on through to retail

903
00:39:08,489 --> 00:39:14,609
dispensaries the price to the consumer

904
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:16,859
is going to be so high that those folks

905
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:20,870
are going to call up their friends and

906
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:24,539
say hey you're still helping out and

907
00:39:20,869 --> 00:39:28,079
it's kind of a shame that we're

908
00:39:24,539 --> 00:39:29,909
criminalizing this plant again anyway

909
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:33,509
I'm gonna stop ranting oh by the way

910
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:36,269
Marcus speaking of concentrates I just

911
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:39,980
had a chance to use some of your bags

912
00:39:36,269 --> 00:39:43,469
to do some Sour Diesel that came out so

913
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:46,170
beautiful glossy black old-school hash

914
00:39:43,469 --> 00:39:48,359
that is thank you

915
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:50,700
boom right on Wade that's great to hear

916
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:52,980
and don't ever worry about your ranting

917
00:39:50,699 --> 00:39:55,259
I love your ranting I could listen to it

918
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:57,690
for hours you got like a soft relaxing

919
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:59,730
voice and it's just you got this super

920
00:39:57,690 --> 00:40:01,530
you got this super good integrity I

921
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:04,550
guess after the South Park episode we

922
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:07,290
should call it Tegrity Tegrity farms

923
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:08,789
available here and there you guys must

924
00:40:07,289 --> 00:40:10,320
have seen that episode the cannabis

925
00:40:08,789 --> 00:40:12,119

934
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:32,920

935
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:36,250

938
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:45,099
head yes so I want to put it out to all

pretty much the best thing you could

962
00:41:54,068 --> 00:41:57,849
ever possibly do is donate to the Claude

the folks who has a permit and license

979
00:42:50,949 --> 00:42:55,868
here in the state and they'll be able to

980
00:42:53,349 --> 00:42:58,860
normalize or bring it into the regulated

981
00:42:55,869 --> 00:43:01,900
marketplace and hold it for the network

982
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:03,579
and we're trying to sort out the details

983
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:05,349
of how it's going to work from there

984
00:43:03,579 --> 00:43:07,840
but like I said if we can get it between

985
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:14,368
now and January first we're allowed to

986
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:18,369
do processing and then formulation and

987
00:43:14,369 --> 00:43:18,850
get it out to the families under state

988
00:43:18,369 --> 00:43:21,940
law

989
00:43:18,849 --> 00:43:29,679
so after January 1st it's a little more

990
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:33,220
of a challenge so yeah that's all I got

991
00:43:29,679 --> 00:43:36,129
if those maybe somebody could post those

992
00:43:33,219 --> 00:43:38,079
websites that's how I will thank you

993
00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:39,608
Marcus I'll put them in the comment

994
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:42,579
section of this video on the youtube

995
00:43:39,608 --> 00:43:45,460
video as well as we'll post it in on

996
00:43:42,579 --> 00:43:46,840
Facebook natural alternatives says that

997
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:49,300
he'll be getting in touch with you Wade

998
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:53,430
he's got a couple of Ringo's gift drying

999
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:57,280
right now that's a really nice plant

1000
00:43:53,429 --> 00:43:59,469
Laurens Ringo was one of the last

1001
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:04,180
crosses that he was trying to stabilize

1002
00:43:59,469 --> 00:44:08,559
before he died and yeah the Fenton

1003
00:44:04,179 --> 00:44:13,539
anyone that does that know that there

1004
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:15,639
are families that you're making a

1005
00:44:13,539 --> 00:44:18,239
difference in not just the quality of

1006
00:44:15,639 --> 00:44:21,940
life but even the opportunity for life

1007
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:24,909
in the in some children's life

1008
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:27,099
experience and I feel like I'm babbling

1009
00:44:24,909 --> 00:44:28,839
here a little bit but I I feel it's so

1010
00:44:27,099 --> 00:44:30,940
deeply and I know some of these families

1011
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:34,690
and some of these kids and it's it just

1012
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:38,650
seems so wrong that a plant that can do

1013
00:44:34,690 --> 00:44:41,409
so much good for these kids is under the

1014
00:44:38,650 --> 00:44:42,309
kind of rules that it still is all over

1015
00:44:41,409 --> 00:44:43,469
the world

1016
00:44:42,309 --> 00:44:47,259
[Music]

1017
00:44:43,469 --> 00:44:50,169
it's really come true to me deeply

1018
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:55,330
deeply true that the plant in and of

1019
00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:58,480
itself can do no harm it's all of the

1020
00:44:55,329 --> 00:45:00,880
behaviors and the reactions to

1021
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:05,079
Prohibition around the plant that have

1022
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:09,880
created all the problems absolutely it's

1023
00:45:05,079 --> 00:45:11,110
so sorry go ahead Marcus well I just you

1024
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:12,940
know when you when you break yourself

1025
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:14,950
out of North America there's still a big

1026
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:17,019
world out there where people are still

1027
00:45:14,949 --> 00:45:19,119
suffering I you know wanted to bring up

1028
00:45:17,019 --> 00:45:21,280
the guy in Malaysia who was giving away

1029
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:23,679
oil to I think over seven or eight

1030
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:25,480
hundred people and they finally caught

1031
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:27,190
him and they put him on death row as

1032
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:29,409
they do in Malaysia with their zero

1033
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:31,240
tolerance and the last I actually heard

1034
00:45:29,409 --> 00:45:33,549
and this is this really shows you the

1035
00:45:31,239 --> 00:45:37,029
power of the plant that Malaysia was

1036
00:45:33,550 --> 00:45:38,650
considering a medical program based on

1037
00:45:37,030 --> 00:45:40,450
this guy's story you have to understand

1038
00:45:38,650 --> 00:45:43,720
like for decades all they've done is

1039
00:45:40,449 --> 00:45:45,460
just hung people it's a total zero

1040
00:45:43,719 --> 00:45:47,379
tolerance country it's one of the

1041
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:49,690
reasons when I was in Thailand and India

1042
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:51,490
cruising around Southeast Asia that I

1043
00:45:49,690 --> 00:45:53,079
refused to go there when people were

1044
00:45:51,489 --> 00:45:54,699
like hey we're gonna go extend our trips

1045
00:45:53,079 --> 00:45:56,440
we're gonna go get a passport stamp in

1046
00:45:54,699 --> 00:45:58,210
Malaysia come back up to Thailand stay

1047
00:45:56,440 --> 00:46:01,570
for a couple more months I was like I'm

1048
00:45:58,210 --> 00:46:03,220
good I smoked too much cannabis and

1049
00:46:01,570 --> 00:46:05,320
cannabis products I probably have hash

1050
00:46:03,219 --> 00:46:07,899
stuck on my back somewhere that I can't

1051
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:10,180
see you know big five gram chunk of

1052
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:13,539
Nepali finger rub that I forgot I have

1053
00:46:10,179 --> 00:46:15,669
just end up yeah well until I met the

1054
00:46:13,539 --> 00:46:17,920
Malaysian border then I absolutely don't

1055
00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:20,530
wish I hate borders as it is I consider

1056
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:22,000
borders to be like prisons it's like

1057
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:23,769
you're gonna you have to and I'm not

1058
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,050
sure if you're getting out or going in

1059
00:46:23,769 --> 00:46:28,030
when you actually go into a country it

1060
00:46:26,050 --> 00:46:30,490
sort of seems like you're going in and

1061
00:46:28,030 --> 00:46:31,900
I'm just not a big fan of prisons I mean

1062
00:46:30,489 --> 00:46:33,789
you know I can already hear Todd

1063
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:35,320
McCormick talking okay I spent five

1064
00:46:33,789 --> 00:46:37,630
years in prisons and I can promise you

1065
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:40,030
there are people that belong in there we

1066
00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:43,329
absolutely [ __ ] lutely need prisons

1067
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:46,360
but not for habitual florists not for

1068
00:46:43,329 --> 00:46:48,489
habitual florists absolutely not okay

1069
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:51,160
and I wanted to I wanted to comment a

1070
00:46:48,489 --> 00:46:53,349
little bit on that you know first of all

1071
00:46:51,159 --> 00:46:55,920
you talking about corporations Marcus

1072
00:46:53,349 --> 00:46:58,509
you know we've been incorporated for

1073
00:46:55,920 --> 00:47:00,909
over 12 years you know so our

1074
00:46:58,510 --> 00:47:03,640
incorporation we've been looking forward

1075
00:47:00,909 --> 00:47:07,119
you know to the market possibly opening

1076
00:47:03,639 --> 00:47:10,629
up and also at the same time protecting

1077
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:14,230
ourselves as porters and as cultivators

1078
00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:16,630
you know that are putting out Metis you

1079
00:47:14,230 --> 00:47:20,050
know when Josh and I started this you

1080
00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:21,640
know over 25 years ago there was a pact

1081
00:47:20,050 --> 00:47:23,350
that we had with the plant that we were

1082
00:47:21,639 --> 00:47:25,509
always going to do good by the plant and

1083
00:47:23,349 --> 00:47:26,980
I know a lot of growers understand what

1084
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:29,500
I'm talking about because there's like

1085
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:32,320
some kind of a safety that comes with

1086
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:35,170
that and that safety then becomes like a

1087
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:37,390
very small and trusted group of people

1088
00:47:35,170 --> 00:47:39,820
that you work with and then all of a

1089
00:47:37,389 --> 00:47:43,839
sudden it becomes legalized and so many

1090
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:46,539
of us growers really community to step

1091
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:48,309
in to understanding what the white

1092
00:47:46,539 --> 00:47:50,980
market looks like or even really how the

1093
00:47:48,309 --> 00:47:53,320
business practices you know to step in

1094
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:56,019
but what we do have is we have the

1095
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:58,059
connections we have the connections we

1096
00:47:56,019 --> 00:47:59,590
have the know-how one thing that I've

1097
00:47:58,059 --> 00:48:01,989
been seeing here and the really large

1098
00:47:59,590 --> 00:48:04,720
lp's is that there's been billions of

1099
00:48:01,989 --> 00:48:07,809
dollars made on the market but nobody

1100
00:48:04,719 --> 00:48:10,359
really is growing good flour to put out

1101
00:48:07,809 --> 00:48:12,969
there so it's like they're not crossing

1102
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:14,710
this bridge with the people who have

1103
00:48:12,969 --> 00:48:17,379
been part of this industry for a long

1104
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:19,659
time we understand how to grow it we

1105
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:21,970
understand how to move it we understand

1106
00:48:19,659 --> 00:48:27,190
how to work with each other and I feel

1107
00:48:21,969 --> 00:48:29,949
like a lot of that straight now and and

1108
00:48:27,190 --> 00:48:32,559
it's absolutely imperative for us as

1109
00:48:29,949 --> 00:48:35,139
activists for us as dispensary owners

1110
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:37,150
for us as growers you know to really

1111
00:48:35,139 --> 00:48:40,929
join together which is what I think that

1112
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:43,420
you know this episode is about because I

1113
00:48:40,929 --> 00:48:45,909
feel like we can really help each other

1114
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:47,889
not only help the ILP is get on the

1115
00:48:45,909 --> 00:48:50,170
right foot because I would love to see

1116
00:48:47,889 --> 00:48:52,659
even these huge big corporations growing

1117
00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:56,349
really healthy beautiful flowers that

1118
00:48:52,659 --> 00:48:57,609
can be concentrated and given out to you

1119
00:48:56,349 --> 00:49:00,429
know people that really need the

1120
00:48:57,610 --> 00:49:03,550
medicine our phone has been ringing off

1121
00:49:00,429 --> 00:49:06,009
the hook we've been getting 50 emails a

1122
00:49:03,550 --> 00:49:09,490
day from people here in Canada who have

1123
00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:12,310
lost access to their medicine so with

1124
00:49:09,489 --> 00:49:14,509
the legalization here in Canada we are

1125
00:49:12,309 --> 00:49:16,639
unable like Marcus was saying to calm

1126
00:49:14,510 --> 00:49:19,310
trait this and a lot of kids are not

1127
00:49:16,639 --> 00:49:20,569
going to be utilizing flour or a lot of

1128
00:49:19,309 --> 00:49:22,549
sick people are not going to be

1129
00:49:20,570 --> 00:49:24,860
utilizing flour they don't necessarily

1130
00:49:22,550 --> 00:49:28,160
know how to concentrate it themselves in

1131
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:31,370
a safe manner and I feel like it's up to

1132
00:49:28,159 --> 00:49:33,049
us as these small growers and as a small

1133
00:49:31,369 --> 00:49:36,079
community that entrusted each other

1134
00:49:33,050 --> 00:49:38,900
before to really step out join together

1135
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:41,900
so that we can bring medicine to the

1136
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:44,300
people and this is our front and

1137
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:46,160
foremost and Josh and I have this this

1138
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:49,160
corporation and right now we're in

1139
00:49:46,159 --> 00:49:52,369
licensure and I'll tell you this

1140
00:49:49,159 --> 00:49:53,119
licensure process up here in Canada is a

1141
00:49:52,369 --> 00:49:55,699

00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:57,799
it is something real the amount of

1143
00:49:55,699 --> 00:50:00,199
paperwork that we're gonna have to do is

1144
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:02,180
going to set us back you know we just

1145
00:50:00,199 --> 00:50:04,879
got the opportunity we just got the

1146
00:50:02,179 --> 00:50:07,039
ability of what kind of licensure that

1147
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:09,430
we need to have what we need to fill out

1148
00:50:07,039 --> 00:50:13,039
for our licensure like it's as if

1149
00:50:09,429 --> 00:50:14,690
everybody who was not a part of them you

1150
00:50:13,039 --> 00:50:16,670
know the corporate market and didn't

1151
00:50:14,690 --> 00:50:19,309
have that piece weren't even allowed to

1152
00:50:16,670 --> 00:50:21,289
come into the game at all until the day

1153
00:50:19,309 --> 00:50:23,659
that it became legalized and we're

1154
00:50:21,289 --> 00:50:25,969
already behind the ball and the LPS are

1155
00:50:23,659 --> 00:50:27,980
not growing anything good and people are

1156
00:50:25,969 --> 00:50:31,549
losing access so what happened was on

1157
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:36,019
October 17th all of the dispensaries

1158
00:50:31,550 --> 00:50:37,940
that created the culture up here to make

1159
00:50:36,019 --> 00:50:39,920
medicine for the people all the stuff

1160
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:41,179
Hillary blacks been doing in life and

1161
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:43,700
all the people that have been having

1162
00:50:41,179 --> 00:50:46,460
connect you know cannabis culture shops

1163
00:50:43,699 --> 00:50:48,619
in Vancouver and Beyond have created a

1164
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:50,780
culture of medicine and the culture of

1165
00:50:48,619 --> 00:50:53,449
healing people like wades talking about

1166
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:55,100
and it caught the idea of the government

1167
00:50:53,449 --> 00:50:57,379
it's it's the myth the medicinal

1168
00:50:55,099 --> 00:50:59,179
qualities you know from the 1800s or

1169
00:50:57,380 --> 00:51:00,890
thousands of years ago that have come to

1170
00:50:59,179 --> 00:51:03,859
this point that of you know taught us we

1171
00:51:00,889 --> 00:51:07,129
know it's medicinal we've created outlaw

1172
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:08,930
systems to show people how it works the

1173
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:10,760
government gets a hold of it and they

1174
00:51:08,929 --> 00:51:14,029
basically sever

1175
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:16,250
they sever that original tie and on

1176
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:17,630
October 17th all of the dispensaries

1177
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:20,719
that we're doing all that work have to

1178
00:51:17,630 --> 00:51:23,150
technically shut their doors or become

1179
00:51:20,719 --> 00:51:25,669
outlaws so what's happened here in

1180
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:27,360
Nelson British Columbia or Vancouver in

1181
00:51:25,670 --> 00:51:29,519
a lot of places that

1182
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:31,740
jurisdictions have come together beyond

1183
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:34,559
the law and decided you know what we're

1184
00:51:31,739 --> 00:51:38,059
gonna keep our doors open until December

1185
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:41,730
31st because that's when these permits

1186
00:51:38,059 --> 00:51:43,619
run out and and local patience and in

1187
00:51:41,730 --> 00:51:46,019
areas came in to say you know what I

1188
00:51:43,619 --> 00:51:47,849
mean as much as we're gaining access in

1189
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:50,159
the future there's gonna be a year or

1190
00:51:47,849 --> 00:51:51,929
two where there's a loss of access so I

1191
00:51:50,159 --> 00:51:54,329
totally agree I think we agree with

1192
00:51:51,929 --> 00:51:57,059
Marcus and everyone that says you know

1193
00:51:54,329 --> 00:51:58,679
the Canadian legalization probably is

1194
00:51:57,059 --> 00:52:01,110
maybe a step in the right direction

1195
00:51:58,679 --> 00:52:03,690
towards access to people but the problem

1196
00:52:01,110 --> 00:52:05,880
is there's this gap in between because

1197
00:52:03,690 --> 00:52:06,570
no one recognizes the strains from the

1198
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:08,309
LPS

1199
00:52:06,570 --> 00:52:11,250
we know them and that's a licensed

1200
00:52:08,309 --> 00:52:13,460
producer here in Canada and though LPS

1201
00:52:11,250 --> 00:52:15,989
have to irradiate their weed to make it

1202
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:17,940
safe for the market so you have

1203
00:52:15,989 --> 00:52:20,699
irradiated weed going out to patients

1204
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:22,470
that are ill essentially or maybe they

1205
00:52:20,699 --> 00:52:26,309
just want to recreative we still think

1206
00:52:22,469 --> 00:52:28,049
it's all medicinal so and also you can't

1207
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:30,329
have concentrates up here so the only

1208
00:52:28,050 --> 00:52:32,630
thing that's available up here in Canada

1209
00:52:30,329 --> 00:52:34,009
at the moment legally is is flour and

1210
00:52:32,630 --> 00:52:37,410
pre-rolls

1211
00:52:34,010 --> 00:52:42,690
so yeah and and those dispensaries that

1212
00:52:37,409 --> 00:52:44,789
are staying a scene 14 years later she

1213
00:52:42,690 --> 00:52:46,800
goes you know they are real activist and

1214
00:52:44,789 --> 00:52:48,690
we as growers here who have brought the

1215
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:52,289
market we need to do everything that we

1216
00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:55,550
can to support them and also we need to

1217
00:52:52,289 --> 00:52:57,989
do everything we can to support these

1218
00:52:55,550 --> 00:52:59,750
corporations and LPS that are stepping

1219
00:52:57,989 --> 00:53:02,849
into the market that are going worldwide

1220
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:04,949
to teach them how to grow medicine to

1221
00:53:02,849 --> 00:53:07,559
teach the plants to teach them what kind

1222
00:53:04,949 --> 00:53:09,659
of strains are helpful for medicine and

1223
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:17,039
I believe that that is the disconnect

1224
00:53:09,659 --> 00:53:21,869
right now that we're facing yes agreed

1225
00:53:17,039 --> 00:53:24,630
agreed it's just a sad situation yet yet

1226
00:53:21,869 --> 00:53:26,369
man it's so much better than like having

1227
00:53:24,630 --> 00:53:28,590
our doors kicked in and and and just

1228
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:30,509
locked up the way it was the zero

1229
00:53:28,590 --> 00:53:32,370
tolerance thing like and I understand

1230
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:34,020
that's not a good reason to be happy but

1231
00:53:32,369 --> 00:53:36,269
it's kind of like just want to stay

1232
00:53:34,019 --> 00:53:36,840
positive in the sense that we have work

1233
00:53:36,269 --> 00:53:39,119
to do

1234
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:41,250
that's that's super clear we absolutely

1235
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:43,559
have work to do but in the meantime

1236
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:45,090
from like fifty to sixty thousand

1237
00:53:43,559 --> 00:53:47,699
medical patients being able to grow

1238
00:53:45,090 --> 00:53:49,590
cannabis to overnight you know 30

1239
00:53:47,699 --> 00:53:52,169
million people being able to grow

1240
00:53:49,590 --> 00:53:54,180
cannabis that's that's something as well

1241
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:56,519
you know and that will change the way

1242
00:53:54,179 --> 00:53:58,079
people think that's going to change you

1243
00:53:56,519 --> 00:54:00,690
know we keep talking about governments

1244
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:03,809
in our piece first of all you know LPS

1245
00:54:00,690 --> 00:54:06,510
and dispensaries both sides have your

1246
00:54:03,809 --> 00:54:08,849
good and have your bad and unfortunately

1247
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:10,920
it's just like a restaurant so how many

1248
00:54:08,849 --> 00:54:13,349
five-star restaurants are there with

1249
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:15,659
impeccable quality ingredients versus

1250
00:54:13,349 --> 00:54:17,429
how many McDonald's azar there there's a

1251
00:54:15,659 --> 00:54:19,079
lot of McDonald's and a lot of fast food

1252
00:54:17,429 --> 00:54:19,500
out there and in Kent in the cannabis

1253
00:54:19,079 --> 00:54:21,360
world

1254
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:22,590
I hear people complaining all day long

1255
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:24,300
about the shitty quality that's

1256
00:54:22,590 --> 00:54:27,210
available through the LPS well guess

1257
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:29,400
what I'm super spoiled and snobby out

1258
00:54:27,210 --> 00:54:30,750
and I think that about 90% of the

1259
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:32,490
dispensaries there's like three

1260
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:35,070
dispensaries I could name in Vancouver

1261
00:54:32,489 --> 00:54:37,109
that I'm like these guys have it going

1262
00:54:35,070 --> 00:54:38,430
on they know how to find proper cannabis

1263
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:39,870
they know how to grow proper cannabis

1264
00:54:38,429 --> 00:54:41,669
they understand the chemo var of each

1265
00:54:39,869 --> 00:54:44,489
strain that they cultivar that they're

1266
00:54:41,670 --> 00:54:46,680
carrying they understand a level that

1267
00:54:44,489 --> 00:54:49,109
brings me confidence that I'm like you

1268
00:54:46,679 --> 00:54:50,730
know what the this is the this is the

1269
00:54:49,110 --> 00:54:53,789
place right here but it's literally like

1270
00:54:50,730 --> 00:54:56,010
probably under 10% and of course for LPS

1271
00:54:53,789 --> 00:54:58,320
that's not going to be any differently

1272
00:54:56,010 --> 00:55:00,870
keep in mind a lot of people that

1273
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:03,240
started LPS whether you guys realize

1274
00:55:00,869 --> 00:55:04,500
this or not we're our peers they were

1275
00:55:03,239 --> 00:55:06,839
the people that we were growing

1276
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:09,630
underground with they were underground

1277
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:13,170
growers that the guy who started aurora

1278
00:55:09,630 --> 00:55:16,079
was an underground black-market grower

1279
00:55:13,170 --> 00:55:17,639
and he did not start Aurora I'm sure

1280
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:19,949
thinking it would be you know this

1281
00:55:17,639 --> 00:55:23,039
gigantic machine that has like gobbled

1282
00:55:19,949 --> 00:55:24,809
up like countries of a product but he

1283
00:55:23,039 --> 00:55:26,880
was definitely coming from a good place

1284
00:55:24,809 --> 00:55:29,099
he was just like one I've met the guy on

1285
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:30,930
multiple occasions he's he's a cannabis

1286
00:55:29,099 --> 00:55:33,809
grower he loves growing cannabis that's

1287
00:55:30,929 --> 00:55:35,940
what he loves to do and with LPS it's

1288
00:55:33,809 --> 00:55:38,610
the same as dispensaries 90% of them are

1289
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:40,679
producing bunk I mean I can't personally

1290
00:55:38,610 --> 00:55:41,940
go into just any dispensary and buy

1291
00:55:40,679 --> 00:55:44,699
great cannabis

1292
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:47,220
I just can't it's it doesn't you know I

1293
00:55:44,699 --> 00:55:49,619
totally agree with you 100% and and that

1294
00:55:47,219 --> 00:55:51,689
maybe this is a great idea are a great

1295
00:55:49,619 --> 00:55:54,190
time maybe to talk to Joshua and just

1296
00:55:51,690 --> 00:55:56,349
say you know part of

1297
00:55:54,190 --> 00:55:59,320
the thing that we're creating and and

1298
00:55:56,349 --> 00:56:01,690
josh has been is you know the science of

1299
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:04,030
regenerative cannabis and to create a

1300
00:56:01,690 --> 00:56:07,510
whole entire conference that's based

1301
00:56:04,030 --> 00:56:09,340
solely on cultivation practices there's

1302
00:56:07,510 --> 00:56:10,840
plenty of cannabis events all over the

1303
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:14,019
world but really they're just sort of

1304
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:15,850
catering to what Aurora's turned into or

1305
00:56:14,019 --> 00:56:18,159
whatever and that's not totally true but

1306
00:56:15,849 --> 00:56:20,319
a lot of times you know you know it's

1307
00:56:18,159 --> 00:56:22,480
the business aspect of cannabis that

1308
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:25,210
people are talking about on panels so I

1309
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:27,849
would like to give Josh Joshua a minute

1310
00:56:25,210 --> 00:56:29,679
here and and bless up Ross kaya from

1311

1312
00:56:29,679 --> 00:56:34,509
and we'll talk to you in a second I

1313
00:56:32,039 --> 00:56:36,429
would like to hear from Josh more about

1314
00:56:34,510 --> 00:56:38,860
this event that's being planted here

1315
00:56:36,429 --> 00:56:41,019
planned here in Vancouver I'd like to

1316
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:43,780
get the British Columbian community and

1317
00:56:41,019 --> 00:56:45,670
the Canadian community at large really

1318
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:47,800
aware of what's happening here in

1319
00:56:45,670 --> 00:56:50,980
Vancouver in January so that we can

1320
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:52,800
bring up the cultivation conscious and

1321
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:55,059
so we can bring up the quality because

1322
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:58,240
Martha was great in the pure

1323
00:56:55,059 --> 00:57:02,289
certification high if you can just turn

1324
00:56:58,239 --> 00:57:04,149
your microphone off you know a part of

1325
00:57:02,289 --> 00:57:07,029
us creating the certification is to just

1326
00:57:04,150 --> 00:57:09,220
get the the word out on how to cultivate

1327
00:57:07,030 --> 00:57:13,120
it and to share our successes and

1328
00:57:09,219 --> 00:57:14,739
failures and also to help Josh Joshua

1329

1330

thanks again for having me on Bo man to

1335
00:57:27,130 --> 00:57:33,849
talk about it the idea of the conference

1336
00:57:30,789 --> 00:57:36,820
it just actually started December right

1337
00:57:33,849 --> 00:57:37,989
around Christmas time last year late me

1338
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:40,059
and my buddy Leighton who got together

1339
00:57:37,989 --> 00:57:43,089
and we were we had become friends and

1340
00:57:40,059 --> 00:57:46,269
and our friendship had led to this kind

1341
00:57:43,090 --> 00:57:49,750
of like challenging of information type

1342
00:57:46,269 --> 00:57:51,369
of friendship and you know you know and

1343
00:57:49,750 --> 00:57:53,289
learning the process of me teaching in

1344
00:57:51,369 --> 00:57:56,469
my process in my education process and

1345
00:57:53,289 --> 00:57:58,509
him teaching me his and and with

1346
00:57:56,469 --> 00:58:00,519
cannabis and organic cannabis it has

1347
00:57:58,510 --> 00:58:02,380
been such a hard learning curve you know

1348
00:58:00,519 --> 00:58:04,420
and that's why we started the

1349
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:06,700
conferences was to really to bring more

1350
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:07,900
education out there because I was in

1351
00:58:06,699 --> 00:58:10,538
Washington here I feel like

1352
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:12,880
a lot of folks that I meet are growing

1353
00:58:10,539 --> 00:58:14,619
hydroponically and they're the biggest

1354
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:16,809
thing is like yes man that your weed

1355
00:58:14,619 --> 00:58:18,818
tastes better it looks better but I

1356
00:58:16,809 --> 00:58:21,460
can't sacrifice a yield and I've been

1357
00:58:18,818 --> 00:58:23,798
like personally on this helmet mission

1358
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:27,250
to get those yields that those into our

1359
00:58:23,798 --> 00:58:28,989
guys are going getting and grow a very

1360
00:58:27,250 --> 00:58:30,400
high quality weed but it was getting the

1361
00:58:28,989 --> 00:58:31,838
information was that the challenging

1362
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:34,119
part so that's why we started the first

1363
00:58:31,838 --> 00:58:37,808
conference and we did one in Portland

1364
00:58:34,119 --> 00:58:39,460
last year January and three or four

1365
00:58:37,809 --> 00:58:42,220
people specifically came up from

1366
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:44,289
Humboldt and invited us to come down to

1367
00:58:42,219 --> 00:58:46,149
read way and put on another one and so I

1368
00:58:44,289 --> 00:58:49,180
had never I've never invented to read to

1369
00:58:46,150 --> 00:58:52,480
Humboldt at all until last March when we

1370
00:58:49,179 --> 00:58:55,929
did this second conference and I got to

1371
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:57,699
meet Rio and Craig and all these folks

1372
00:58:55,929 --> 00:58:59,919
and got there like learn the culture of

1373
00:58:57,699 --> 00:59:02,078
how folks are really are banding

1374
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:04,930
together down there and it's it's very

1375
00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:07,690
impressive because in a lot of way you

1376
00:59:04,929 --> 00:59:09,759
know California has been growing wheat

1377
00:59:07,690 --> 00:59:11,528
for so long that they're just that much

1378
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:13,510
more advanced and seeing how these

1379
00:59:11,528 --> 00:59:17,079
smaller guys are banding together it's

1380
00:59:13,510 --> 00:59:19,539
really impressive and so the conference

1381
00:59:17,079 --> 00:59:22,059
has just kind of been you know gaining

1382
00:59:19,539 --> 00:59:23,680
momentum and so this year we reached out

1383
00:59:22,059 --> 00:59:25,480
to more folks and said you know if you

1384
00:59:23,679 --> 00:59:28,778
want us to do these more of these like

1385
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:31,240
we need people to host and so we're

1386
00:59:28,778 --> 00:59:33,880
doing four conferences this year one in

1387
00:59:31,239 --> 00:59:38,889
Vancouver it's going to be January 11th

1388
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:43,240
12th and 13th we're gonna do one in red

1389
00:59:38,889 --> 00:59:48,250
way again which will be February 21st

1390
00:59:43,239 --> 00:59:50,608
22nd 23rd and then Portland Maine March

1391
00:59:48,250 --> 00:59:56,559
1st 2nd and 3rd and Ann Arbor Michigan

1392
00:59:50,608 --> 00:59:58,179
March 22nd 23rd and 24th and so that

1393
00:59:56,559 --> 01:00:00,730
those are kind of the places we're doing

1394
00:59:58,179 --> 01:00:02,409
it and you know I really want if folks

1395
01:00:00,730 --> 01:00:05,349
that are in though that area to hop on

1396
01:00:02,409 --> 01:00:09,548
our website it's a regenerative organic

1397
01:00:05,349 --> 01:00:11,798
cannabis calm and yeah I don't you know

1398
01:00:09,548 --> 01:00:15,519
what guide me and some questions Josh

1399
01:00:11,798 --> 01:00:17,108
and Kelly to kind of talk about so one

1400
01:00:15,519 --> 01:00:19,088
thing that you know I think is going to

1401
01:00:17,108 --> 01:00:21,039
be really useful is to talk about you

1402
01:00:19,088 --> 01:00:25,239
know the different aspects of the

1403
01:00:21,039 --> 01:00:26,949
the speakers even like Steve from from

1404
01:00:25,239 --> 01:00:31,289
green life you know being able to talk

1405
01:00:26,949 --> 01:00:34,000
about indoor cultivation some of the bug

1406
01:00:31,289 --> 01:00:35,550
families that are predator you can talk

1407
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:39,789
you can say that you're gonna basically

1408
01:00:35,550 --> 01:00:42,010
be touching on each aspect of the grow

1409
01:00:39,789 --> 01:00:44,230
and I think that this this this event

1410
01:00:42,010 --> 01:00:45,850
really is set apart in the fact that you

1411
01:00:44,230 --> 01:00:47,740
have an opportunity to really talk to

1412
01:00:45,849 --> 01:00:50,559
experts in different parts of the field

1413
01:00:47,739 --> 01:00:52,359
so I mean how did you come to choosing

1414
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:54,549
some of those people yeah it's so it's

1415
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:56,019
my education process really straight up

1416
01:00:54,550 --> 01:00:59,050
and then kind of morphing that with

1417
01:00:56,019 --> 01:01:00,969
Leighton in his connections I don't take

1418
01:00:59,050 --> 01:01:03,250
any sponsors we're not selling anything

1419
01:01:00,969 --> 01:01:06,099
that's the big thing is like I want it

1420
01:01:03,250 --> 01:01:07,480
to be pure education and so it costs a

1421
01:01:06,099 --> 01:01:09,009
little bit of money people who have kind

1422
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:12,159
of given me a little flak on that we're

1423
01:01:09,010 --> 01:01:15,910
charging 125 a day we're doing discount

1424
01:01:12,159 --> 01:01:17,829

1425
01:01:15,909 --> 01:01:19,089

1426
01:01:17,829 --> 01:01:22,029
make it we're doing you know three-day

1427
01:01:19,090 --> 01:01:24,160
discount and before December first

1428
01:01:22,030 --> 01:01:25,930
discount but the way we've lined it up

1429
01:01:24,159 --> 01:01:28,989
Friday is gonna be kind of like

1430
01:01:25,929 --> 01:01:30,429
beginning with dr. lang Alain Ingham

1431
01:01:28,989 --> 01:01:32,169
she's gonna come in and talk about the

1432
01:01:30,429 --> 01:01:35,049
soil food web who are the players the

1433
01:01:32,170 --> 01:01:38,159
microorganisms how does it work how do

1434
01:01:35,050 --> 01:01:41,500
these microorganisms transfer transform

1435
01:01:38,159 --> 01:01:43,119
rocks into nutrients and then we're

1436
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:45,250
going to go into Layton he'll talk about

1437
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:48,630
a bit a bit more about that and in the

1438
01:01:45,250 --> 01:01:53,139
process of how we can work with compost

1439
01:01:48,630 --> 01:01:54,700
and then we go into chip Osborne who he

1440
01:01:53,139 --> 01:01:55,929
is like he's like a soil chemistry guy

1441
01:01:54,699 --> 01:01:57,489
and so he'll come and talk about

1442
01:01:55,929 --> 01:01:59,409
actually I'll bring out the periodic

1443
01:01:57,489 --> 01:02:02,529
chart and talk about all the chemistry

1444
01:01:59,409 --> 01:02:06,789
components and how we can achieve the

1445
01:02:02,530 --> 01:02:08,560
proper balance organically and then we

1446
01:02:06,789 --> 01:02:12,099
have Josh and I let's see I'm trying to

1447
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:13,659
think of the order of the flow then we

1448
01:02:12,099 --> 01:02:16,420
have Steve raisin or who talks about

1449
01:02:13,659 --> 01:02:19,690
aquaponics and then we're gonna go into

1450
01:02:16,420 --> 01:02:21,550
a Dem pure night we did this two nights

1451
01:02:19,690 --> 01:02:24,309
under the last two conferences it was

1452
01:02:21,550 --> 01:02:27,250
really powerful we brought in a panel of

1453
01:02:24,309 --> 01:02:30,159
four or five dem peer certified farmers

1454
01:02:27,250 --> 01:02:32,860
and just had a discussion about

1455
01:02:30,159 --> 01:02:34,599
practices you know and walk through each

1456
01:02:32,860 --> 01:02:34,930
farmer how do you achieve this how do

1457
01:02:34,599 --> 01:02:37,690
you

1458
01:02:34,929 --> 01:02:40,389
nutrient management do you achieve you

1459
01:02:37,690 --> 01:02:43,690
know at p.m. and it's it was really

1460
01:02:40,389 --> 01:02:46,449
powerful just to connect with peers you

1461
01:02:43,690 --> 01:02:47,980
know and then the next day we kind of

1462
01:02:46,449 --> 01:02:50,318
flipped Saturday and to go into it more

1463
01:02:47,980 --> 01:02:54,130
of a tools based system so we open up

1464
01:02:50,318 --> 01:02:56,469
with Chris Trump who does Korean natural

1465
01:02:54,130 --> 01:02:58,420
farming and he's going to do a good

1466
01:02:56,469 --> 01:03:00,730
two-hour session and talk about that and

1467
01:02:58,420 --> 01:03:02,349
how you know those are those who do know

1468
01:03:00,730 --> 01:03:04,690
what Korean natural farming is it's

1469
01:03:02,349 --> 01:03:07,359
really a nutrient management tool set

1470
01:03:04,690 --> 01:03:09,400
and you make all these concoctions and

1471
01:03:07,358 --> 01:03:10,799
brews that you can manage nutrients

1472
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:13,358
throughout the life cycle of the plant

1473
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:15,490
so he has a he has a pretty good

1474
01:03:13,358 --> 01:03:16,690
presentation in Korea nurture farming

1475
01:03:15,489 --> 01:03:19,358
it's all about how to produce those

1476
01:03:16,690 --> 01:03:22,869
products off your own land with buying

1477
01:03:19,358 --> 01:03:26,469
very little his big claim to fame as he

1478
01:03:22,869 --> 01:03:29,500
ran an 800 acre of macadamia nut farm in

1479
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:33,549
Hawaii and he was able to manage the

1480
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:36,489
nutrient load with $500 an acre enough

1481
01:03:33,550 --> 01:03:39,880
inputs which is mind-boggling you know

1482
01:03:36,489 --> 01:03:40,779
it's very cheap so so I have a question

1483
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:43,650
yeah

1484
01:03:40,780 --> 01:03:46,420
is this something that you will post

1485
01:03:43,650 --> 01:03:53,798
afterwards like video footage of

1486
01:03:46,420 --> 01:03:56,260
somewhere you know help in Vancouver

1487
01:03:53,798 --> 01:03:58,960
with that if you knew yes we're not

1488
01:03:56,260 --> 01:04:00,250
gonna post the speakers and it's mostly

1489
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:03,670
because a lot of the speakers want

1490
01:04:00,250 --> 01:04:05,469
freedom to say things that people who

1491
01:04:03,670 --> 01:04:09,039
run companies that sell products might

1492
01:04:05,469 --> 01:04:11,679
not want them to say and specifically

1493
01:04:09,039 --> 01:04:13,929
lady was gonna speak next on Saturday

1494
01:04:11,679 --> 01:04:16,690
Suzanne Wainwright she's a beneficial

1495
01:04:13,929 --> 01:04:19,029
insect specialist and people don't like

1496
01:04:16,690 --> 01:04:20,858
to hear you know that sell bottled

1497
01:04:19,030 --> 01:04:23,890
products pesticides they don't like her

1498
01:04:20,858 --> 01:04:26,108
message and she brings a really strong

1499
01:04:23,889 --> 01:04:28,539
and bold message and so she doesn't want

1500
01:04:26,108 --> 01:04:30,250
to be recorded so we're gonna honor that

1501
01:04:28,539 --> 01:04:32,980
with the speakers but we are going to

1502
01:04:30,250 --> 01:04:35,048
record the the evening sessions we're

1503
01:04:32,980 --> 01:04:37,420
going to do a growers panel on Friday

1504
01:04:35,048 --> 01:04:40,088
night a Dem pure panel on Saturday night

1505
01:04:37,420 --> 01:04:41,950
and then all day sunday is going to be a

1506
01:04:40,088 --> 01:04:43,869
genetics day so we're kind of like have

1507
01:04:41,949 --> 01:04:46,058
these broken up into you know you know

1508
01:04:43,869 --> 01:04:48,789
here's how all the biology works here's

1509
01:04:46,059 --> 01:04:51,970
the tools how to do plant nutrients

1510
01:04:48,789 --> 01:04:54,480
beneficial insect and then the third day

1511
01:04:51,969 --> 01:04:57,279
is all genetics and Cameron Jo Durie

1512
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:59,860
from wonderland nursery down in Humboldt

1513
01:04:57,280 --> 01:05:02,019
is organizing that and I don't know

1514
01:04:59,860 --> 01:05:04,289
folks have seen he through a post out to

1515
01:05:02,019 --> 01:05:06,670
call out breeders and we're gonna do

1516
01:05:04,289 --> 01:05:09,820
breeders panels that day as well those

1517
01:05:06,670 --> 01:05:12,789
will be recorded and we're gonna put all

1518
01:05:09,820 --> 01:05:17,170
that on the YouTube so a little bit we

1519
01:05:12,789 --> 01:05:19,119
also really laugh like to have our talks

1520
01:05:17,170 --> 01:05:21,880
and presentations recorded even though

1521
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:26,880
we feel we are saying bold things we

1522
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:26,880
think that I'm the old things yes Craig

1523
01:05:27,059 --> 01:05:33,699
you know we we think that this is the

1524
01:05:30,010 --> 01:05:36,010
time to be bold and we have a nutrient

1525
01:05:33,699 --> 01:05:37,779
company but yet we are whole entire

1526
01:05:36,010 --> 01:05:40,360
teaching is to tell people to go beyond

1527
01:05:37,780 --> 01:05:42,430
that so you know huge respect to

1528
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:46,120
everyone in their path and stuff but

1529
01:05:42,429 --> 01:05:48,579
this is what we think is powerful and so

1530
01:05:46,119 --> 01:05:50,650
I think we're gonna probably have our

1531
01:05:48,579 --> 01:05:53,139
talk recorded and we'll talk to you and

1532
01:05:50,650 --> 01:05:54,700
the rest of the crew about that out and

1533
01:05:53,139 --> 01:05:58,900
we always try to do that we think it's

1534
01:05:54,699 --> 01:06:00,849
really important and yeah I just want to

1535
01:05:58,900 --> 01:06:03,880
say one more time like maybe Marcus can

1536
01:06:00,849 --> 01:06:05,589
put post the link to this event and I

1537
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:07,329
think that people can spend a hundred

1538
01:06:05,590 --> 01:06:09,039
and twenty-five dollars a day and feel

1539
01:06:07,329 --> 01:06:11,380
incredibly good about it because you're

1540
01:06:09,039 --> 01:06:12,550
spending thousands of dollars to correct

1541
01:06:11,380 --> 01:06:14,860
your mistakes

1542
01:06:12,550 --> 01:06:16,000
and if you can write yourself with

1543
01:06:14,860 --> 01:06:18,490
correct information

1544
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:20,320
you're only gonna benefit yourself so

1545
01:06:18,489 --> 01:06:22,119
like everyone take a look at that that

1546
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:24,400
website in the link and thanks a lot

1547
01:06:22,119 --> 01:06:28,239
Josh for putting that together and we

1548
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:30,369
won it over - uh - Ross kaya so what's

1549
01:06:28,239 --> 01:06:32,799

1552
01:06:34,449 --> 01:06:37,839
just want to hear about your successes

1553
01:06:36,550 --> 01:06:39,730
and things that have been really

1554
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:44,370
challenging in the Washington market

1555
01:06:39,730 --> 01:06:46,780
these days for you first can you hear me

1556

this will be my second time doing this

1558
01:06:48,849 --> 01:06:53,549
kind of format so I'm rusty um good

1559
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:56,650
morning everybody

1560
01:06:53,550 --> 01:06:59,200
Washington State is crazy right now it

1561
01:06:56,650 --> 01:07:03,099
took a while to get into the rec market

1562
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:05,949
and I want to say we started about

1563
01:07:03,099 --> 01:07:07,749
eighteen months ago designing this

1564
01:07:05,949 --> 01:07:11,469
really incredible massive indoor

1565
01:07:07,748 --> 01:07:14,139
facility and were able to do some things

1566
01:07:11,469 --> 01:07:16,209
there that nobody else was really

1567
01:07:14,139 --> 01:07:18,368
focusing on especially regarding our

1568
01:07:16,210 --> 01:07:26,259
hash production so you know building out

1569
01:07:18,369 --> 01:07:27,999
a large scale water hash space shout out

1570
01:07:26,259 --> 01:07:30,670
fresh Shetty's I was on there a long

1571
01:07:27,998 --> 01:07:35,169
time ago soaking up all the all the

1572
01:07:30,670 --> 01:07:36,970
tidbits and knowledge and you know my

1573
01:07:35,170 --> 01:07:41,880
first set of bags with Bubba man bags

1574
01:07:36,969 --> 01:07:44,498
and good friends with with oil slicks

1575
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:47,048
he's he's talked about you and I

1576
01:07:44,498 --> 01:07:48,189
connecting for a long time and I'm gonna

1577
01:07:47,048 --> 01:07:50,650
have to come north of the border it

1578
01:07:48,190 --> 01:07:54,700
sounds like so come up and did he tell

1579
01:07:50,650 --> 01:07:56,798
you our story of how we met no no he met

1580
01:07:54,699 --> 01:07:59,348
me at my gallery the melting point that

1581
01:07:56,798 --> 01:08:01,900
I had back in 2003 in Vancouver he

1582
01:07:59,349 --> 01:08:04,479
rolled by and I had this take this long

1583
01:08:01,900 --> 01:08:07,028
countertop called the inhalation station

1584
01:08:04,478 --> 01:08:08,889
of vaporization and I had like 10

1585
01:08:07,028 --> 01:08:10,389
different vaporizers on the counter I

1586
01:08:08,889 --> 01:08:11,949
brought all of these vaporizers to

1587
01:08:10,389 --> 01:08:13,929
Canada for the first time like the

1588
01:08:11,949 --> 01:08:16,809
aeromed which was built and designed by

1589
01:08:13,929 --> 01:08:19,000
cancer patients out of Germany the via

1590
01:08:16,810 --> 01:08:21,369
the volcano I met Marcus and his

1591
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:23,529
daughter years ago in in Dortmund

1592
01:08:21,368 --> 01:08:26,439
Germany at a cannabis show in the in the

1593
01:08:23,529 --> 01:08:29,170
90s and so I brought I had all of these

1594
01:08:26,439 --> 01:08:31,509
vaporizers and he came in and right away

1595
01:08:29,170 --> 01:08:34,298
we kind of connected and I was I pulled

1596
01:08:31,509 --> 01:08:37,420
out some foam outs and of course you

1597
01:08:34,298 --> 01:08:39,399
know one of my favorite mentors who's in

1598
01:08:37,420 --> 01:08:41,380
the room right now skunk man Sam who was

1599
01:08:39,399 --> 01:08:44,198
a huge inspiration to me in the way that

1600
01:08:41,380 --> 01:08:46,420
I looked at cannabis and looked at resin

1601
01:08:44,198 --> 01:08:49,149
and learned about getting the resin off

1602
01:08:46,420 --> 01:08:52,118
of the plant and only really smoking you

1603
01:08:49,149 --> 01:08:54,608
know for for almost 20 years now I've

1604
01:08:52,118 --> 01:08:57,309
just smoked ash whether it's being

1605
01:08:54,609 --> 01:08:58,929
vaporized off cannabis flowers or you

1606
01:08:57,310 --> 01:09:02,529
know smoke as Raw's and rice if they're

1607
01:08:58,929 --> 01:09:05,259
bubble and so Sam always smoked back in

1608
01:09:02,529 --> 01:09:07,359
the day with matches in fact at the

1609
01:09:05,259 --> 01:09:09,609
Cannabis Cup you could follow around the

1610
01:09:07,359 --> 01:09:11,920
little pile of screams perfect stainless

1611
01:09:09,609 --> 01:09:13,599
steel screens and the matches because

1612
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:15,429
he's like hit a bowl and then throw the

1613
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:16,960
screen out after he hit a bowl and put a

1614
01:09:15,429 --> 01:09:19,449
new book new screen and

1615
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:22,000
for a fresh new rip and although it was

1616
01:09:19,449 --> 01:09:24,309
ridiculous I have to say it was like it

1617
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:26,829
was it was it was so amazing to hit a

1618
01:09:24,310 --> 01:09:29,830
fresh scream each time you had a ball

1619
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:33,220
anyway to get to how I met oil slick I

1620
01:09:29,829 --> 01:09:38,289
was smoking with matches well well he

1621
01:09:33,220 --> 01:09:39,280
took he used nine matches to get his hit

1622
01:09:38,289 --> 01:09:41,739
a full meltdown

1623
01:09:39,279 --> 01:09:43,779
he just kept like it was like he was

1624
01:09:41,739 --> 01:09:45,609
blowing it out without blowing it out it

1625
01:09:43,779 --> 01:09:47,289
was quite funny so when he came back

1626
01:09:45,609 --> 01:09:49,449
into my life years later and he was like

1627
01:09:47,289 --> 01:09:51,039
oh I met you at the melting point do you

1628
01:09:49,449 --> 01:09:52,720
remember me do you remember me I had the

1629
01:09:51,039 --> 01:09:53,829
mustache I had this I had that I'm like

1630
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:56,740
I don't remember you and then he was

1631
01:09:53,829 --> 01:09:59,590
like okay dude I was the guy that took

1632
01:09:56,739 --> 01:10:01,779
nine matches to burn a single bowl of

1633
01:09:59,590 --> 01:10:07,420
full-mouth and I was like oh my god dude

1634
01:10:01,779 --> 01:10:09,399
I remember you completely shut up dude

1635
01:10:07,420 --> 01:10:11,380
it made me smile when you came in and

1636
01:10:09,399 --> 01:10:13,119
said you were gonna do like some

1637
01:10:11,380 --> 01:10:15,220
large-scale water extraction we're gonna

1638
01:10:13,119 --> 01:10:19,659
have to uh we'll have to talk after the

1639
01:10:15,220 --> 01:10:22,180
show sounds good sounds good um so yeah

1640
01:10:19,659 --> 01:10:23,859
that was uh that's kind of where where

1641
01:10:22,180 --> 01:10:26,650
things kicked off um I had met these

1642
01:10:23,859 --> 01:10:29,019
guys two years ago and they they invited

1643
01:10:26,649 --> 01:10:33,489
me up to help with this project so

1644
01:10:29,020 --> 01:10:34,960
18-year 18 months in the making and he

1645
01:10:33,489 --> 01:10:39,149
dropped our first hash I don't know

1646
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:40,960
three four months ago and really changed

1647
01:10:39,149 --> 01:10:43,629
changed a lot of things about the

1648
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:46,930
recreational hash game in Washington you

1649
01:10:43,630 --> 01:10:48,940
know the people wanted it but the

1650
01:10:46,930 --> 01:10:51,220
producers and processors just weren't

1651
01:10:48,939 --> 01:10:54,879
providing it the models that are set up

1652
01:10:51,220 --> 01:10:57,310
here it's really hard to make any kind

1653
01:10:54,880 --> 01:11:00,579
of money and so once you get into that

1654
01:10:57,310 --> 01:11:03,190
environment there's a lot of

1655
01:11:00,579 --> 01:11:05,100
corner-cutting and it just it's just

1656
01:11:03,189 --> 01:11:07,719
kind of a weird space to operate in and

1657
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:09,760
you know when when I had pitched this

1658
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:11,680
this business model a lot of people said

1659
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:13,900
hey you can't do that you're you're out

1660
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:17,200
of your mind the top dollar and hash

1661
01:11:13,899 --> 01:11:18,849
right now wholesale is like 20 bucks you

1662
01:11:17,199 --> 01:11:20,199
know so for your your best hash that

1663
01:11:18,850 --> 01:11:23,670
you're making you're only gonna get 20

1664
01:11:20,199 --> 01:11:26,409
dollars a gram for it and we actually

1665
01:11:23,670 --> 01:11:28,960
we're getting $30 a gram for our highest

1666
01:11:26,409 --> 01:11:30,599
grade wholesale and just bump the market

1667
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:34,100
up and people are coming in and picking

1668
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:36,720
and coming back and buying out the store

1669
01:11:34,100 --> 01:11:39,480
it's just is this a rare product people

1670
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:43,020
aren't thinking about where this leads

1671
01:11:39,479 --> 01:11:45,389
so I started in the lead game in 96 at

1672
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:46,740
Western Washington University just a you

1673
01:11:45,390 --> 01:11:48,840
know hop skip and a jump from the

1674
01:11:46,739 --> 01:11:50,789
Canadian border so I was up in in

1675
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:52,440
Vancouver all the time blood brothers

1676
01:11:50,789 --> 01:11:53,760
you know the first was poppin off up

1677
01:11:52,439 --> 01:11:55,349
there and Dan we were up there all the

1678
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:57,329
time and getting searched every time we

1679
01:11:55,350 --> 01:11:59,160
came back across the border you know

1680
01:11:57,329 --> 01:12:01,140
house mark house mark which one you guys

1681
01:11:59,159 --> 01:12:02,849
is the master grower you know they'd

1682
01:12:01,140 --> 01:12:06,570
find a magazine and then you know hold

1683
01:12:02,850 --> 01:12:07,980
you there for 3-4 hours and and we'd

1684
01:12:06,569 --> 01:12:09,090
[ __ ] with them back you know we blaze

1685
01:12:07,979 --> 01:12:11,459
right up to the border and throw

1686
01:12:09,090 --> 01:12:13,409
everything out you know knowing they

1687
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:14,699
were gonna mess with us but you know we

1688
01:12:13,409 --> 01:12:18,960
figured we're gonna be stoned while we

1689
01:12:14,699 --> 01:12:23,819
were detained anyway so that was always

1690
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:27,539
fun it's crazy to see how far it's come

1691
01:12:23,819 --> 01:12:29,699
and you know you were talking about

1692
01:12:27,539 --> 01:12:33,569
earlier Marcus about and I'm just kind

1693
01:12:29,699 --> 01:12:35,189
of all over the place right now but you

1694
01:12:33,569 --> 01:12:37,079
were talking about how things have

1695
01:12:35,189 --> 01:12:39,269
changed right so we're in the black

1696
01:12:37,079 --> 01:12:41,760
market days and we saw this stuff coming

1697
01:12:39,270 --> 01:12:44,400
from Canada we never saw California weed

1698
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:46,230
in Washington just it just never came up

1699
01:12:44,399 --> 01:12:50,069
and then after 9/11 they shut that

1700
01:12:46,229 --> 01:12:51,479
border down a lot of my Canadian friends

1701
01:12:50,069 --> 01:12:53,309
actually moved down here and sort of

1702
01:12:51,479 --> 01:12:56,459
buying up neighborhoods and doing indoor

1703
01:12:53,310 --> 01:12:58,530
grows and you know things have just kind

1704
01:12:56,460 --> 01:13:01,500
of changed and then with the advent of

1705
01:12:58,529 --> 01:13:04,439
medical in 2010 in Washington the first

1706
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:06,659
brick and mortars went up and there was

1707
01:13:04,439 --> 01:13:08,519
like four of them and the one closest to

1708
01:13:06,659 --> 01:13:09,599
me had they've got invaded and I went

1709
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:11,220
out I didn't know the guys I went out

1710
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:13,440
and I bailed him out and said hey let me

1711
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:16,289
let me help you with your shop and that

1712
01:13:13,439 --> 01:13:17,669
kind of got me going into the medical so

1713
01:13:16,289 --> 01:13:19,500
this is to me this is like the third

1714
01:13:17,670 --> 01:13:21,539
iteration of a market when it goes to

1715
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:22,979
recreational so we've seen this this

1716
01:13:21,539 --> 01:13:25,199
over and over again we know where it's

1717
01:13:22,979 --> 01:13:27,239
gonna go right so when the medical

1718
01:13:25,199 --> 01:13:29,429
opened up in Washington a lot of that

1719
01:13:27,239 --> 01:13:32,010
Canadian herb or California herb came up

1720
01:13:29,430 --> 01:13:33,840
and we've never seen it before and the

1721
01:13:32,010 --> 01:13:35,579
patients a lot of them are new patients

1722
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:37,260
they've never seen it before so they

1723
01:13:35,579 --> 01:13:39,869
didn't understand even you know that

1724
01:13:37,260 --> 01:13:42,869
this was like not the highest grade

1725
01:13:39,869 --> 01:13:44,319
herbs so they bought that for a year or

1726
01:13:42,869 --> 01:13:46,029
two and then

1727
01:13:44,319 --> 01:13:47,768
after about two years of that you you

1728
01:13:46,029 --> 01:13:48,998
couldn't you couldn't push it it didn't

1729
01:13:47,769 --> 01:13:50,708
have the same value they wanted the

1730
01:13:48,998 --> 01:13:54,969
local need that was you know clearly a

1731
01:13:50,708 --> 01:13:58,269
higher grade and then the hash came

1732
01:13:54,969 --> 01:14:00,189
right and you saw this push of BHO and

1733
01:13:58,269 --> 01:14:02,530
nobody even wanted to buy bubble hash

1734
01:14:00,189 --> 01:14:04,059
anymore I mean I had stores tell me pho

1735
01:14:02,529 --> 01:14:06,219
skilled bubble hash I wouldn't give you

1736
01:14:04,059 --> 01:14:07,570
ten dollars for your you know what we'd

1737
01:14:06,219 --> 01:14:09,328
now call six star there was no star

1738
01:14:07,569 --> 01:14:11,828
sister back then they killed nothing

1739
01:14:09,328 --> 01:14:12,938
yeah they killed nothing now they're you

1740
01:14:11,828 --> 01:14:15,639
know they want to pay me more than ever

1741
01:14:12,939 --> 01:14:18,070
for it but you know we can see these

1742
01:14:15,639 --> 01:14:19,809
cycles so when you come into this rec

1743
01:14:18,069 --> 01:14:21,668
market in Washington you can see that

1744
01:14:19,809 --> 01:14:26,649
same cycle repeating itself everybody's

1745
01:14:21,668 --> 01:14:29,828
on BHO that's produced a lot cheaper I

1746
01:14:26,649 --> 01:14:31,149
think the average wholesale prices for

1747
01:14:29,828 --> 01:14:34,029
pho and Washington state are like I

1748
01:14:31,149 --> 01:14:35,679
don't know six to twelve bucks you know

1749
01:14:34,029 --> 01:14:38,559
where as we were getting thirty four the

1750
01:14:35,679 --> 01:14:42,760
the six star so you know huge difference

1751
01:14:38,559 --> 01:14:44,079
the people want it the system doesn't

1752
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:47,708
necessarily want it because the system

1753
01:14:44,078 --> 01:14:49,148
wants to reward high production that

1754
01:14:47,708 --> 01:14:50,288
kind of stuff and that's just you know

1755
01:14:49,149 --> 01:14:52,749
the way that it's set up there over

1756
01:14:50,288 --> 01:14:54,069
taxing it and you know we see the same

1757
01:14:52,748 --> 01:14:57,698
mistakes playing out in a lot of

1758
01:14:54,069 --> 01:14:59,498
different markets so it's it's kind of

1759
01:14:57,698 --> 01:15:01,118
in a weird spot here in Washington but

1760
01:14:59,498 --> 01:15:05,380
you know we know we're where the people

1761
01:15:01,118 --> 01:15:07,089
want to go that are consuming and we

1762
01:15:05,380 --> 01:15:09,399
know where the people want to go that

1763
01:15:07,090 --> 01:15:13,149
are trying to you know make a living off

1764
01:15:09,399 --> 01:15:16,360
of this and it's really tough for for

1765
01:15:13,149 --> 01:15:18,219
grassroots guys especially in Washington

1766
01:15:16,359 --> 01:15:19,779
State I don't know the laws and other

1767
01:15:18,219 --> 01:15:21,668
places but in Washington State I

1768
01:15:19,779 --> 01:15:25,288
couldn't bring any of my own money into

1769
01:15:21,668 --> 01:15:27,939
this because it was black market money

1770
01:15:25,288 --> 01:15:29,768
so you're almost forced to partner with

1771
01:15:27,939 --> 01:15:34,510
somebody and that doesn't always work

1772
01:15:29,769 --> 01:15:35,739
out and it's it's really tough we can

1773
01:15:34,510 --> 01:15:40,208
get into that a little more later you

1774
01:15:35,738 --> 01:15:42,759
know my current situation is it's kind

1775
01:15:40,208 --> 01:15:43,898
of up in the air right now so I don't

1776
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:47,110
know that it's gonna work out

1777
01:15:43,899 --> 01:15:51,820
most likely not but that will lead to

1778
01:15:47,109 --> 01:15:54,609
something else another door opening it

1779
01:15:51,819 --> 01:15:56,529
will work out yeah just stick with your

1780
01:15:54,609 --> 01:15:57,849
heart stick with your heart you'll it'll

1781
01:15:56,529 --> 01:15:59,500
lead you your family and

1782
01:15:57,850 --> 01:16:01,600
in the right direction you have the

1783
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:03,579
quality and everything and maybe you

1784
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:05,200
could tell us just a quick little bit

1785
01:16:03,579 --> 01:16:07,960
about your genetics because a lot of

1786
01:16:05,199 --> 01:16:09,099
people have been including ourselves you

1787
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:13,960
know super-impressed

1788
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:16,510
a with the coffee more and the whole

1789
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:18,850
alien vibe that's going on there like it

1790
01:16:16,510 --> 01:16:20,829
works really good outdoors up here in

1791
01:16:18,850 --> 01:16:23,710
British it was really wonderful and it

1792
01:16:20,829 --> 01:16:25,180
was like that but it was a phenomenal

1793
01:16:23,710 --> 01:16:27,310
flavor so maybe you can tell us a little

1794
01:16:25,180 --> 01:16:28,480
bit about worldwide roots genetics and

1795
01:16:27,310 --> 01:16:31,030
then we'll hear from a couple other

1796
01:16:28,479 --> 01:16:35,919
people Marc skunk in and Craig who came

1797
01:16:31,029 --> 01:16:37,809
on awesome yeah those plants really do

1798
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:39,850
work out well we've had him thrown I've

1799
01:16:37,810 --> 01:16:41,920
got a lot of good my wife is from Big

1800
01:16:39,850 --> 01:16:44,680
Island so a lot of folks are growing

1801
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:48,210
coffee Island and a Bordeaux and those

1802
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:50,950
climates it's a very versatile plant I

1803
01:16:48,210 --> 01:16:53,350
got into breeding there was an old-timer

1804
01:16:50,949 --> 01:16:55,659
on the forums lemon HoCo shout out lemon

1805
01:16:53,350 --> 01:16:57,340
HoCo he holds a really incredible

1806
01:16:55,659 --> 01:17:01,649
blueberry he's bred some really fun

1807
01:16:57,340 --> 01:17:06,579
stuff with cam and anyways my dad was a

1808
01:17:01,649 --> 01:17:07,960
he bred chickens and hounds and I was in

1809
01:17:06,579 --> 01:17:09,789
a session with Mel and he said you know

1810
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:11,230
you should be breeding you've got great

1811
01:17:09,789 --> 01:17:15,640
genetics you should be breeding these

1812
01:17:11,229 --> 01:17:18,039
and I don't know and so he talked me

1813
01:17:15,640 --> 01:17:21,940
into it kind of drive me into it really

1814
01:17:18,039 --> 01:17:23,079
and I got hooked I mean I got hook line

1815
01:17:21,939 --> 01:17:25,119
and sinker

1816
01:17:23,079 --> 01:17:28,989
I had changed up my whole room on how

1817
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:31,180
things and you know I always thought it

1818
01:17:28,989 --> 01:17:33,279
was really kind of shady you go to buy

1819
01:17:31,180 --> 01:17:34,659
seeds online and you see one picture of

1820
01:17:33,279 --> 01:17:36,399
one plant and you're like wow that's

1821
01:17:34,659 --> 01:17:37,479
beautiful I'm I'm gonna get those seeds

1822
01:17:36,399 --> 01:17:40,569
that's what I'm gonna get then you get

1823
01:17:37,479 --> 01:17:41,889
him and that's wasn't what it was and I

1824
01:17:40,569 --> 01:17:43,630
think you know that the market is

1825
01:17:41,890 --> 01:17:46,720
evolved people's understanding has

1826
01:17:43,630 --> 01:17:48,310
evolved people want to use different

1827
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:50,260
kinds of seeds to grow different kinds

1828
01:17:48,310 --> 01:17:52,180
of crops you know if you're gonna look

1829
01:17:50,260 --> 01:17:53,380
lower you might want you know feminized

1830
01:17:52,180 --> 01:17:56,050
stuff or you don't have to come out and

1831
01:17:53,380 --> 01:17:57,340
check for sex if you're growing indoor

1832
01:17:56,050 --> 01:17:58,420
and you're just trying to find a mom so

1833
01:17:57,340 --> 01:17:59,409
your people are growing for different

1834
01:17:58,420 --> 01:18:01,239
reasons and we're kind of having a

1835
01:17:59,409 --> 01:18:03,550
better understanding of what these

1836
01:18:01,239 --> 01:18:04,769
different kind of seeds give us if your

1837
01:18:03,550 --> 01:18:07,930
breeder you might want to be

1838
01:18:04,770 --> 01:18:11,090
ex-something for for you know selecting

1839
01:18:07,930 --> 01:18:13,619
for a male to breed

1840
01:18:11,090 --> 01:18:13,980
so I I just I just kind of got into it

1841
01:18:13,619 --> 01:18:16,979
that way

1842
01:18:13,979 --> 01:18:19,349
and at the time that I had gotten

1843
01:18:16,979 --> 01:18:21,479
started Mel had given me some seeds that

1844
01:18:19,350 --> 01:18:24,539
had the alien genetic in it the alien

1845
01:18:21,479 --> 01:18:26,809
tech and I found some good stuff in

1846
01:18:24,539 --> 01:18:29,488
there and started playing with it and

1847
01:18:26,810 --> 01:18:31,770
you know Kai's coffee won its first High

1848
01:18:29,488 --> 01:18:34,289
Times cup didn't win it it was like

1849
01:18:31,770 --> 01:18:37,830
third place in Seattle in 2014 I think

1850
01:18:34,289 --> 01:18:39,510
but it was the highest tested strain so

1851
01:18:37,829 --> 01:18:42,180
super powerful and it really had this

1852
01:18:39,510 --> 01:18:45,150
great narcotic effect and it dumps hash

1853
01:18:42,180 --> 01:18:49,470
it it dumps hash crazy amounts of hash

1854
01:18:45,149 --> 01:18:51,479
huge huge returns 26% 30% on flowers

1855
01:18:49,470 --> 01:18:53,280
when you're pressing just the flowers

1856
01:18:51,479 --> 01:18:55,109
and when you're washing it you get great

1857
01:18:53,279 --> 01:18:56,460
great yields as well so what's the

1858
01:18:55,109 --> 01:18:57,899
difference between the washing and

1859
01:18:56,460 --> 01:19:01,079
pressing yields like if you're getting

1860
01:18:57,899 --> 01:19:02,759
25 to 26 percent out of pressing what

1861
01:19:01,079 --> 01:19:05,550
where would you sit around for

1862
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:08,130
extracting with with water hash fresh

1863
01:19:05,550 --> 01:19:11,310
frozen on the coffee probably close to 5

1864
01:19:08,130 --> 01:19:13,560
percent 5% return but that's fresh

1865
01:19:11,310 --> 01:19:17,789
frozen fresh frozen whole plant fresh

1866
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:19,680
frozen yeah yeah so I generally you know

1867
01:19:17,789 --> 01:19:21,300
if it's a you can do a little bit of a

1868
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:23,520
conversion so we would say that would

1869
01:19:21,300 --> 01:19:26,070
might be like a 20% if you if you were

1870
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:33,720
washing dry flowers you might get 20%

1871
01:19:26,069 --> 01:19:35,549
back on that it's a dump I always I'm

1872
01:19:33,720 --> 01:19:38,699
always interested in the different

1873
01:19:35,550 --> 01:19:40,860
yields from oil to water hash and anyone

1874
01:19:38,699 --> 01:19:44,010
can correct me if I'm wrong but my

1875
01:19:40,859 --> 01:19:46,109
theory is is that and I've recently

1876
01:19:44,010 --> 01:19:47,640
posted a photo on Instagram that shows

1877
01:19:46,109 --> 01:19:51,839
this fairly powerfully like what

1878
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:53,640
material looks like after I wash it I'm

1879
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:54,779
not sure if anyone saw that in fact why

1880
01:19:53,640 --> 01:19:56,130
wouldn't I just show it right now

1881
01:19:54,779 --> 01:19:58,529
because I'm not going to send everyone

1882
01:19:56,130 --> 01:20:00,390
to my Instagram account right so I

1883
01:19:58,529 --> 01:20:02,819
posted this picture

1884
01:20:00,390 --> 01:20:07,350
it's basically material that I've washed

1885
01:20:02,819 --> 01:20:09,988
it's been washed and I show that I've

1886
01:20:07,350 --> 01:20:14,310
been efficient at getting the heads off

1887
01:20:09,988 --> 01:20:16,919
so there's the photo right there so

1888
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:20,400
that's those are basically all of the

1889
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:22,649
capitate stocked and all of the sessile

1890
01:20:20,399 --> 01:20:24,599
stocked not all of them but I'd say 90

1891
01:20:22,649 --> 01:20:26,250
plus percent maybe

1892
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:27,539
ninety-five percent in this particular

1893
01:20:26,250 --> 01:20:29,460
instance it looks like it's a hundred

1894
01:20:27,539 --> 01:20:32,369
percent except you can see one little

1895
01:20:29,460 --> 01:20:36,000
amber trike there and in the right of

1896
01:20:32,369 --> 01:20:40,050
the of the leaf but what I've noticed is

1897
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:43,109
that the difference between your yields

1898
01:20:40,050 --> 01:20:44,670
from bubble hash to oil for me at least

1899
01:20:43,109 --> 01:20:47,939
because I know my efficiency because I

1900
01:20:44,670 --> 01:20:50,520
checked with a microscope of extraction

1901
01:20:47,939 --> 01:20:52,379
is that when you run it through a plant

1902
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:54,990
fat extraction or a solvent extraction

1903
01:20:52,380 --> 01:20:57,270
or a rosin press or whatever and you get

1904
01:20:54,989 --> 01:20:59,309
that rest of that oil out it seems to

1905
01:20:57,270 --> 01:21:01,260
come from the third type of trichome the

1906
01:20:59,310 --> 01:21:03,840
bulbous the one that sits on a single

1907
01:21:01,260 --> 01:21:05,430
Stipe Sal the one that doesn't easily

1908
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:08,430
break off through mechanical screen

1909
01:21:05,430 --> 01:21:10,730
separations or water extractions and so

1910
01:21:08,430 --> 01:21:13,320
I'm always interested if that's the case

1911
01:21:10,729 --> 01:21:14,969
you know to know what the percentage you

1912
01:21:13,319 --> 01:21:18,299
know bright you just mentioned it was

1913
01:21:14,970 --> 01:21:20,880
potentially six percent of the yields is

1914
01:21:18,300 --> 01:21:22,860
sitting in those bulbous trichomes and

1915
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:24,420
that's also a unique way to be able to

1916
01:21:22,859 --> 01:21:26,099
separate them out when you press them

1917
01:21:24,420 --> 01:21:28,440
into rosin and I always said this to the

1918
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:30,240
oil guys that I inevitably we were I

1919
01:21:28,439 --> 01:21:31,949
guess back in the day it was almost like

1920
01:21:30,239 --> 01:21:33,960
arguments arguing because I was the

1921
01:21:31,949 --> 01:21:37,349
water hash guy and they were the BHO

1922
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:38,760
guys and so they would be saying like oh

1923
01:21:37,350 --> 01:21:40,680
yeah we you know we get away nice a

1924
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:42,270
product and I'm like yeah but you know

1925
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:44,280
like maybe it would be nicer if you

1926
01:21:42,270 --> 01:21:46,350
actually isolated your glans first and

1927
01:21:44,279 --> 01:21:48,329
then made oil with that you know rather

1928
01:21:46,350 --> 01:21:50,850
than taking because for me I was never a

1929
01:21:48,329 --> 01:21:54,329
fan at least for inhaling or vaporizing

1930
01:21:50,850 --> 01:21:56,310
or smoking bulbous heads like extracting

1931
01:21:54,329 --> 01:21:58,409
just bulbous heads out which you can do

1932
01:21:56,310 --> 01:22:01,320
by running some water hash and then

1933
01:21:58,409 --> 01:22:03,180
taking that material in doing an oil

1934
01:22:01,319 --> 01:22:05,880
extraction or a rosin press or a fat

1935
01:22:03,180 --> 01:22:08,190
plat extraction press you can find out

1936
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:09,750
what your ratio is of how much resin now

1937
01:22:08,189 --> 01:22:11,729
of course if you were inefficient in

1938
01:22:09,750 --> 01:22:13,229
your mixing this would be altered in

1939
01:22:11,729 --> 01:22:14,639
your data because if you weren't

1940
01:22:13,229 --> 01:22:16,409
extracting all of the glandular

1941
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:20,490
trichomes heads from the capitate and

1942
01:22:16,409 --> 01:22:22,949
the sessle's then obviously the data

1943
01:22:20,489 --> 01:22:26,789
would be no good but from what I've seen

1944
01:22:22,949 --> 01:22:31,139
it's anywhere between six and fifteen

1945
01:22:26,789 --> 01:22:33,000
percent the differences between how much

1946
01:22:31,140 --> 01:22:34,560
those bulbous heads can weigh cuz some

1947
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:36,689
plants that I photograph it's they're

1948
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:38,400
literally on every leaf like every fan

1949
01:22:36,689 --> 01:22:40,379
leaf just has bulbous heads

1950
01:22:38,399 --> 01:22:42,988
stuck all along and they're very very

1951
01:22:40,380 --> 01:22:44,429
small you don't really see them with the

1952
01:22:42,988 --> 01:22:46,529
naked eye the same way you see the

1953
01:22:44,429 --> 01:22:48,779
little ones that the capitate stalks and

1954
01:22:46,529 --> 01:22:54,509
the capitate sessle's that stand up tall

1955
01:22:48,779 --> 01:22:58,500
so yeah arkad yes the materials fresh

1956
01:22:54,510 --> 01:23:03,199
frozen then it's hard to with my weight

1957
01:22:58,500 --> 01:23:07,500
to compare that to rice if two yields or

1958
01:23:03,198 --> 01:23:09,988
or even hey Jo yields depending on what

1959
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:11,609
the material they started with yeah I

1960
01:23:09,988 --> 01:23:13,408
mean unless you can do you know I've

1961
01:23:11,609 --> 01:23:16,319
always divided by either four or five

1962
01:23:13,408 --> 01:23:18,089
I've seen most material come out in a

1963
01:23:16,319 --> 01:23:21,269
division of four but there is some that

1964
01:23:18,090 --> 01:23:23,100
happens 2/5 meaning when I you know dry

1965
01:23:21,270 --> 01:23:25,800
a hundred grams of it I get twenty grams

1966
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:30,179
instead of 25 grams and I think always

1967
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:35,840
you know that the fresh frozen has any

1968
01:23:30,179 --> 01:23:39,090
extra in Tanjung moisture inside the red

1969
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:41,579
yeah absolutely I think that it's it's

1970
01:23:39,090 --> 01:23:43,829
just like dry sift trying to wet wash

1971
01:23:41,579 --> 01:23:46,079
with you know sift that still has

1972
01:23:43,829 --> 01:23:49,019
moisture content in the in the in the

1973
01:23:46,079 --> 01:23:52,649
wax membrane of the head it's when I use

1974
01:23:49,020 --> 01:23:54,630
fresh frozen its and the terpene content

1975
01:23:52,649 --> 01:23:56,009
is much higher too which tends to sort

1976
01:23:54,630 --> 01:23:58,789
of butter out the resin sometimes

1977
01:23:56,010 --> 01:24:04,980
depending on what terpenes are there but

1978
01:23:58,789 --> 01:24:09,050
yeah I've definitely seen that that that

1979
01:24:04,979 --> 01:24:13,439
has been seen by me for sure I agree

1980
01:24:09,050 --> 01:24:15,239
we'll bring some coffee over for you to

1981
01:24:13,439 --> 01:24:18,299
play around with Marcus how do you like

1982
01:24:15,238 --> 01:24:20,669
that one yeah I like it I want to check

1983
01:24:18,300 --> 01:24:22,409
out the coffee I I don't even drink

1984
01:24:20,670 --> 01:24:24,000
coffee but there is a reggae artist

1985
01:24:22,408 --> 01:24:26,009
named coffee who has a track with

1986
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:33,810
chronics right now on the BBC live which

1987
01:24:26,010 --> 01:24:36,630
is straight I hope to go to Jamaica next

1988
01:24:33,810 --> 01:24:39,449
month actually as well as Colombia got a

1989
01:24:36,630 --> 01:24:40,920
little bit of an embark trip coming up

1990
01:24:39,448 --> 01:24:42,750
and hopefully I'll be able to do some

1991
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:46,109
filming while I'm down in those two

1992
01:24:42,750 --> 01:24:48,689
countries should not exciting hey some

1993
01:24:46,109 --> 01:24:51,000
people donated while we were chatting I

1994
01:24:48,689 --> 01:24:51,808
think it was about 65 bucks here so I'll

1995
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:57,019
send that off

1996

01:26:47,670 --> 01:26:56,489
be doing too much of that so that's cool

2028
01:26:52,408 --> 01:27:00,089
well if if Craig can get unmuted whoa

2029
01:26:56,488 --> 01:27:02,098
yeah if he puts his mouse on this on the

2030
01:27:00,090 --> 01:27:04,650
top of the like where I am right now and

2031
01:27:02,099 --> 01:27:06,569
yeah that's it then the bar on top will

2032
01:27:04,649 --> 01:27:08,488
open with the phone in the COG and the

2033
01:27:06,569 --> 01:27:10,590
Wi-Fi and the camera microphone in the

2034
01:27:08,488 --> 01:27:13,078
person symbol and he can just go into

2035
01:27:10,590 --> 01:27:14,880
the microphone symbol and click that and

2036
01:27:13,078 --> 01:27:16,319
that will unmute it it's always nice to

2037
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:18,929
let people know how to do these things

2038
01:27:16,319 --> 01:27:20,429
sometimes difficult hopefully it works

2039
01:27:18,929 --> 01:27:21,840
out for him I was the one that weeded

2040
01:27:20,429 --> 01:27:23,760
his mic when he came in because he was

2041
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:26,789
moving his scream and someone was

2042
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:28,560
talking but these are the technical

2043
01:27:26,789 --> 01:27:33,029
difficulties we deal with on a daily

2044
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:34,920
basis here on hash Church it happens so

2045
01:27:33,029 --> 01:27:36,630
maybe we'll just move over I had a quick

2046
01:27:34,920 --> 01:27:38,670
question for a nice mark how you know

2047
01:27:36,630 --> 01:27:40,050

2049
01:27:40,050 --> 01:27:59,279

2050
01:27:42,238 --> 01:28:02,309
message sorry about all the noise we can

2051
01:27:59,279 --> 01:28:03,929
hear you and all the noise it's okay are

2052
01:28:02,310 --> 01:28:07,310
you coming back from fish or something

2053
01:28:03,929 --> 01:28:09,750
no I'm actually I'm heading up to a

2054
01:28:07,310 --> 01:28:12,060
company called ascend wellness is

2055
01:28:09,750 --> 01:28:14,429
working out a project called grow mass

2056
01:28:12,060 --> 01:28:16,230
which is a very large production

2057
01:28:14,429 --> 01:28:18,480
facility in the middle of Massachusetts

2058
01:28:16,229 --> 01:28:21,509
so heading up for the first time to see

2059
01:28:18,479 --> 01:28:25,609
the facility in the building it was an

2060
01:28:21,510 --> 01:28:28,289
old machine factory or they used to make

2061
01:28:25,609 --> 01:28:31,609
drill bits and drill presses and stuff

2062
01:28:28,289 --> 01:28:35,279
like that so they're converting an old

2063
01:28:31,609 --> 01:28:36,929
factory rundown Factory and a England

2064
01:28:35,279 --> 01:28:39,710
town that probably felt the economic

2065
01:28:36,929 --> 01:28:42,389
depression of a business going away to

2066
01:28:39,710 --> 01:28:43,449
you know putting a cannabis operation in

2067
01:28:42,389 --> 01:28:46,989
there

2068
01:28:43,449 --> 01:28:49,909
this is a company called ascend wellness

2069
01:28:46,989 --> 01:28:52,279
it's got multiple licenses in multiple

2070
01:28:49,909 --> 01:28:56,630
states but this is their project Orion

2071
01:28:52,279 --> 01:29:00,859
Massachusetts awesome very cool I think

2072
01:28:56,630 --> 01:29:03,440
I know ascend wellness yeah they have a

2073
01:29:00,859 --> 01:29:04,489
couple of different operations I think

2074
01:29:03,439 --> 01:29:09,679
you can google them I think they

2075
01:29:04,489 --> 01:29:11,449
actually have a website so yeah I mean

2076
01:29:09,680 --> 01:29:14,270
that's why I'm always interested Marcus

2077
01:29:11,449 --> 01:29:15,859
when I see pictures of you working on

2078
01:29:14,270 --> 01:29:17,540
the whole scale of the shoe that you

2079
01:29:15,859 --> 01:29:21,469
were talking earlier and a lot of things

2080
01:29:17,539 --> 01:29:23,689
work at small artisan scale but you

2081
01:29:21,470 --> 01:29:26,560
really find out how scalable these

2082
01:29:23,689 --> 01:29:29,539
things are when you go to make several

2083
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:32,360
hundred kilos or a thousand kilos of

2084
01:29:29,539 --> 01:29:35,960
material is different than making a few

2085
01:29:32,359 --> 01:29:36,829
kilos or a couple grams right yes

2086
01:29:35,960 --> 01:29:38,539
correct

2087
01:29:36,829 --> 01:29:40,039
that is that is what I'm in the middle

2088
01:29:38,539 --> 01:29:44,000
of dealing with right now with my new

2089
01:29:40,039 --> 01:29:46,310
company in park they're the whole the

2090
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:47,869
whole process is basically scalability

2091
01:29:46,310 --> 01:29:50,630
and taking you know things like

2092
01:29:47,869 --> 01:29:53,359
ultrasonic cry out cry authen all all -

2093
01:29:50,630 --> 01:29:55,520
co2 - large-scale industrial

2094
01:29:53,359 --> 01:30:00,109
commercialized water extraction that's

2095
01:29:55,520 --> 01:30:03,200
GMP compliance and terpene extraction

2096
01:30:00,109 --> 01:30:05,420
hydro vac distillation steam vac

2097
01:30:03,199 --> 01:30:07,789
distillation all of these different

2098
01:30:05,420 --> 01:30:09,859
components rosin working with pure

2099
01:30:07,789 --> 01:30:12,739
pressure so we're definitely looking at

2100
01:30:09,859 --> 01:30:14,989
the scale of Bishop the scalability

2101
01:30:12,739 --> 01:30:16,819
issue in each of those components that

2102
01:30:14,989 --> 01:30:20,599
will allow us to not sacrifice the

2103
01:30:16,819 --> 01:30:23,299
quality itself that being said you know

2104
01:30:20,600 --> 01:30:25,220
there's only so much quality that I

2105
01:30:23,300 --> 01:30:27,350
really think that one of our biggest

2106
01:30:25,220 --> 01:30:29,329
steps that we need to take in this whole

2107
01:30:27,350 --> 01:30:31,850
because everyone preaches the whole like

2108
01:30:29,329 --> 01:30:34,340
oh we got a you know you got a boycott

2109
01:30:31,850 --> 01:30:36,140
the LPS and buy from from the from the

2110
01:30:34,340 --> 01:30:39,289
micro farmer and stuff it's like listen

2111
01:30:36,140 --> 01:30:41,480
I support that I just want everyone to

2112
01:30:39,289 --> 01:30:43,130
be like on the same I lost trust in

2113
01:30:41,479 --> 01:30:44,899
people a long time ago when they started

2114
01:30:43,130 --> 01:30:48,350
especially here in BC where people were

2115
01:30:44,899 --> 01:30:50,449
just spraying you know avid and and

2116
01:30:48,350 --> 01:30:52,220
defender sulfur products that could

2117
01:30:50,449 --> 01:30:53,590
never be removed from the product all

2118
01:30:52,220 --> 01:30:55,969
sorts of different

2119
01:30:53,590 --> 01:30:59,000
foliar sprays in blue

2120
01:30:55,969 --> 01:31:01,100
like people were we're doing it not good

2121
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:02,659
and not safe and you can see it in the

2122
01:31:01,100 --> 01:31:04,070
end product where it look it might have

2123
01:31:02,659 --> 01:31:06,079
looked nice but there was something off

2124
01:31:04,069 --> 01:31:08,809
about it there's something wrong about

2125
01:31:06,079 --> 01:31:10,340
it and I just like the idea when I go to

2126
01:31:08,810 --> 01:31:13,640
a kitchen to know that they follow

2127
01:31:10,340 --> 01:31:15,590
simple food safety regulations you know

2128
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:18,710
what I mean and I don't want cannabis to

2129
01:31:15,590 --> 01:31:20,810
be treated like plutonium and be be that

2130
01:31:18,710 --> 01:31:23,630
difficult but it should have just a few

2131
01:31:20,810 --> 01:31:25,039
small regulations definitely the

2132
01:31:23,630 --> 01:31:26,569
packaging and all that protect the

2133
01:31:25,039 --> 01:31:27,829
children [ __ ] is out the window

2134
01:31:26,569 --> 01:31:30,259
because you definitely don't need to

2135
01:31:27,829 --> 01:31:32,960
protect children from cannabis the worst

2136
01:31:30,260 --> 01:31:36,020
side effect would be ordering a pizza

2137
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:37,399
and so I think that you don't need to

2138
01:31:36,020 --> 01:31:38,660
protect children from cannabis you

2139
01:31:37,399 --> 01:31:40,639
should protect them from things like

2140
01:31:38,659 --> 01:31:42,079
fentanyl and pharmaceutical drugs and

2141
01:31:40,640 --> 01:31:44,210
alcohol that's pretty much in most

2142
01:31:42,079 --> 01:31:46,819
people's homes but not necessarily

2143
01:31:44,210 --> 01:31:48,289
cannabis but at the same time regulate

2144
01:31:46,819 --> 01:31:51,019
it to the point where I don't trust

2145
01:31:48,289 --> 01:31:52,880
[ __ ] you know I just don't

2146
01:31:51,020 --> 01:31:55,250
not with my lungs of something that I'm

2147
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:57,440
breathing all the time I've been to an F

2148
01:31:55,250 --> 01:31:59,448
to Macon farms with like super righteous

2149
01:31:57,439 --> 01:32:01,849
Jamaican Rastus that are just like

2150
01:31:59,448 --> 01:32:04,279
awesome dudes and then I do a little

2151
01:32:01,850 --> 01:32:07,160
walk-around around the perimeter of the

2152
01:32:04,279 --> 01:32:10,340
property and then I find the the bottles

2153
01:32:07,159 --> 01:32:12,859
that they used of these fungicides or

2154
01:32:10,340 --> 01:32:14,930
herbicides or like basically toxic

2155
01:32:12,859 --> 01:32:17,869
poisons that aren't even allowed in

2156
01:32:14,930 --> 01:32:19,489
North America we're just like send that

2157
01:32:17,869 --> 01:32:21,890
ship to the Caribbean they don't just

2158
01:32:19,488 --> 01:32:23,238
like dispose of it they still sell it to

2159
01:32:21,890 --> 01:32:25,969
countries that don't have these rules

2160
01:32:23,238 --> 01:32:29,359
and regulations and so then I see it and

2161
01:32:25,969 --> 01:32:31,069
I'm like man like I can't I can't do

2162
01:32:29,359 --> 01:32:33,139
that I can't work with material like

2163
01:32:31,069 --> 01:32:35,029
that and I think that the one good thing

2164
01:32:33,140 --> 01:32:37,340
that I personally like about the

2165
01:32:35,029 --> 01:32:40,250
regulations is catching people doing

2166
01:32:37,340 --> 01:32:43,250
that that's important catching people

2167
01:32:40,250 --> 01:32:45,170
doing that testing for that [ __ ] so that

2168
01:32:43,250 --> 01:32:46,850
we know when we're inhaling it and

2169
01:32:45,170 --> 01:32:49,670
everyone also just claims to be for the

2170
01:32:46,850 --> 01:32:51,560
patients that's not true I wish it was

2171
01:32:49,670 --> 01:32:53,119
but it's just not true we got to be

2172
01:32:51,560 --> 01:32:55,550
honest with ourselves here like not

2173
01:32:53,119 --> 01:32:58,309
everyone out there is for the patient's

2174
01:32:55,550 --> 01:33:01,130
a whole fuckload of people are for the

2175
01:32:58,310 --> 01:33:03,410
prohibition based dollar and that's and

2176
01:33:01,130 --> 01:33:05,510
so many people you know learned

2177
01:33:03,409 --> 01:33:08,300
cultivation methods with a lot of those

2178
01:33:05,510 --> 01:33:08,840
toxins and they don't understand how not

2179
01:33:08,300 --> 01:33:11,360
to

2180
01:33:08,840 --> 01:33:13,730
I know that there is a tremendous amount

2181
01:33:11,359 --> 01:33:15,769
of you know people that have just been

2182
01:33:13,729 --> 01:33:17,629
using those toxins and and haven't

2183
01:33:15,770 --> 01:33:19,849
further their education and that's where

2184
01:33:17,630 --> 01:33:21,650
you know Joshua you come in with this

2185
01:33:19,849 --> 01:33:23,719
education platform that you're having

2186
01:33:21,649 --> 01:33:26,029
for a lot of people and joining together

2187
01:33:23,719 --> 01:33:28,609
with small farmers we have the ability

2188
01:33:26,029 --> 01:33:30,948
to educate not educate not only educate

2189
01:33:28,609 --> 01:33:32,658
farmers but also educate consumers that

2190
01:33:30,948 --> 01:33:34,939
this sort of thing is happening in

2191
01:33:32,658 --> 01:33:36,799
cultivation and that they need to demand

2192
01:33:34,939 --> 01:33:39,109
at their dispensaries and at the places

2193
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:40,940
that they purchased these products you

2194
01:33:39,109 --> 01:33:42,819
know where does this come from and what

2195
01:33:40,939 --> 01:33:45,888
kind of integrity was it growing with

2196
01:33:42,819 --> 01:33:48,618
Craig are you available Cragar you are

2197
01:33:45,889 --> 01:33:59,090
you ready to talk from alpenglow did you

2198
01:33:48,618 --> 01:34:00,738
say Tegrity is good oh I just love

2199
01:33:59,090 --> 01:34:04,340
hanging out with all of you guys some

2200
01:34:00,738 --> 01:34:06,589
new faces some old faces it's looking

2201
01:34:04,340 --> 01:34:08,929
about something interesting maybe Steve

2202
01:34:06,590 --> 01:34:12,380
you can tell us a little bit about your

2203
01:34:08,929 --> 01:34:14,270
concentrate experience there in Nevada I

2204
01:34:12,380 --> 01:34:16,159
think people might be interested to know

2205
01:34:14,270 --> 01:34:19,130
what you're doing also I would love to

2206
01:34:16,158 --> 01:34:22,549
hear from you about your jars and your

2207
01:34:19,130 --> 01:34:24,679
packaging for your for your buds and and

2208
01:34:22,550 --> 01:34:26,090
and stuff that you do and that's part of

2209
01:34:24,679 --> 01:34:28,069
your pure certification is one of your

2210
01:34:26,090 --> 01:34:29,690
closed loops as you redo your jars and

2211
01:34:28,069 --> 01:34:32,630
that's a problem up here in Canada is

2212
01:34:29,689 --> 01:34:35,059
just creating all this medicine and then

2213
01:34:32,630 --> 01:34:36,618
we have to surround it in garbage in

2214
01:34:35,060 --> 01:34:38,420
order to get it to people so basically

2215
01:34:36,618 --> 01:34:40,880
it's like all of our weed has to have a

2216
01:34:38,420 --> 01:34:43,250
percentage of landfill attached to it in

2217
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:45,859
order for it to be like okay for the

2218
01:34:43,250 --> 01:34:52,158
public so Steve can you tell us a bit

2219
01:34:45,859 --> 01:34:54,229
about your situation yes so here you

2220
01:34:52,158 --> 01:34:56,089
know as far as its attractions that I

2221
01:34:54,229 --> 01:34:58,009
personally don't have a license for GOP

2222
01:34:56,090 --> 01:35:00,409
to extract yet but I do work with

2223
01:34:58,010 --> 01:35:01,699
evergreen organics and I am aware of

2224
01:35:00,408 --> 01:35:04,399
their situation what they have to do as

2225
01:35:01,698 --> 01:35:06,678
far as extractions go and its tested

2226
01:35:04,399 --> 01:35:08,920
it's always clean most everybody these

2227
01:35:06,679 --> 01:35:12,560
days uses distillate and basically

2228
01:35:08,920 --> 01:35:15,050
brings it down to nothing but for the

2229
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:17,570
most part as far as our packaging

2230
01:35:15,050 --> 01:35:19,730
program our jaw recycling program yes

2231
01:35:17,569 --> 01:35:22,309
kicked off it's been really cool it's

2232
01:35:19,729 --> 01:35:22,769
it's not only a way to recycle order

2233
01:35:22,310 --> 01:35:25,380
back

2234
01:35:22,770 --> 01:35:29,460
production but it just kind of distills

2235
01:35:25,380 --> 01:35:31,529
this recycling mindset in our consumer

2236
01:35:29,460 --> 01:35:35,130
so that they they save these jars it may

2237
01:35:31,529 --> 01:35:36,899
reuse them with other flour or other

2238
01:35:35,130 --> 01:35:38,430
purposes some people show us send us

2239
01:35:36,899 --> 01:35:40,769
pictures of them making candles out of

2240
01:35:38,430 --> 01:35:41,880
them and and putting coins in them and

2241
01:35:40,770 --> 01:35:43,650
just doing all kinds of crazy things

2242
01:35:41,880 --> 01:35:45,539
with them and it's still you know a way

2243
01:35:43,649 --> 01:35:47,429
to recycle it but we offer a program

2244
01:35:45,539 --> 01:35:48,899
where we do pop-ups at local

2245
01:35:47,430 --> 01:35:50,340
dispensaries where it gives us an

2246
01:35:48,899 --> 01:35:52,829
opportunity to kind of educate the

2247
01:35:50,340 --> 01:35:56,039
patients on on our strains on terpenes

2248
01:35:52,829 --> 01:35:57,779
on just different team of ours and how

2249
01:35:56,039 --> 01:35:59,519
they affect you and at the same time we

2250
01:35:57,779 --> 01:36:01,769
offer a jar return program where the

2251
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:03,270
patients can bring various numbers of

2252
01:36:01,770 --> 01:36:04,410
jars in and depending on how much are

2253
01:36:03,270 --> 01:36:07,260
they bring back there's certain things

2254
01:36:04,409 --> 01:36:10,590
that we offer from a pre-roll to it to a

2255
01:36:07,260 --> 01:36:12,000
hat to shirts things like that so it's

2256
01:36:10,590 --> 01:36:14,630
kind of like a way to market build a

2257
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:18,720
connection with our with our patients

2258
01:36:14,630 --> 01:36:21,510
spread that the recycling vibe I guess

2259
01:36:18,720 --> 01:36:24,270
if you will mindset just so cool that we

2260
01:36:21,510 --> 01:36:25,739
can give back and it's it's dim care

2261
01:36:24,270 --> 01:36:26,970
certifiable so it's one of the things I

2262
01:36:25,739 --> 01:36:29,219
recommend most people should look into

2263
01:36:26,970 --> 01:36:32,490
i'm packaging in the regulated market

2264
01:36:29,220 --> 01:36:34,170
and gets expensive lasting III

2265
01:36:32,489 --> 01:36:36,359
personally don't like buying the flower

2266
01:36:34,170 --> 01:36:39,149
in plastic bags that dries out no matter

2267
01:36:36,359 --> 01:36:40,769
how long it sits on the shelf so I

2268
01:36:39,149 --> 01:36:42,000
definitely prefer a good packaging so

2269
01:36:40,770 --> 01:36:45,110
this is just more way that we're able to

2270
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:47,220
offer a quality packaging without really

2271
01:36:45,109 --> 01:36:51,839
exploiting and building these landfills

2272
01:36:47,220 --> 01:36:54,030
and building carbon footprint also Steve

2273
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:56,100
you know we've been seeing you all out

2274
01:36:54,029 --> 01:36:57,960
there I mean your company is really out

2275
01:36:56,100 --> 01:37:00,930
there and we're seeing you all over the

2276
01:36:57,960 --> 01:37:03,210
place and really educating both farmers

2277
01:37:00,930 --> 01:37:05,159
and consumers and I really want to

2278
01:37:03,210 --> 01:37:07,020
commend you guys for that and I also

2279
01:37:05,159 --> 01:37:09,210
want to talk about you know you've been

2280
01:37:07,020 --> 01:37:12,090
really busting the myth on healthy

2281
01:37:09,210 --> 01:37:14,220
indoor your facility I I would love to

2282
01:37:12,090 --> 01:37:16,829
hear a little bit about how you guys are

2283
01:37:14,220 --> 01:37:18,659
really the leader in indoor cultivation

2284
01:37:16,829 --> 01:37:20,909
living soil and you're getting

2285
01:37:18,659 --> 01:37:23,550
tremendous yields and incredible health

2286
01:37:20,909 --> 01:37:27,269
I know that in Nevada deals with really

2287
01:37:23,550 --> 01:37:29,369
strict testing and and I would just love

2288
01:37:27,270 --> 01:37:31,770
to hear a little bit more about and how

2289
01:37:29,369 --> 01:37:36,329
you've kept your soil healthy overs you

2290
01:37:31,770 --> 01:37:38,910
know 14 cycles now 14 everyone 14 cycles

2291
01:37:36,329 --> 01:37:41,880
my production has been running and it's

2292
01:37:38,909 --> 01:37:44,309
phenomenal yeah you know I mean we're

2293
01:37:41,880 --> 01:37:47,670
always evolving we're always adding and

2294
01:37:44,310 --> 01:37:48,990
changing things as you know depending on

2295
01:37:47,670 --> 01:37:51,869
what the plans tell us and pending on

2296
01:37:48,989 --> 01:37:54,139
what solar reports tell us if north part

2297
01:37:51,869 --> 01:37:57,630
with just always try to minimize our

2298
01:37:54,140 --> 01:38:00,420
inputs and I was trying to maximize the

2299
01:37:57,630 --> 01:38:01,920
outputs we're very successful just in

2300
01:38:00,420 --> 01:38:03,840
the team I've built around me I have a

2301
01:38:01,920 --> 01:38:06,300
very passionate team that that's very

2302
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:09,119
dedicated to what they do and they do a

2303
01:38:06,300 --> 01:38:12,300
really good job without them I mean I'd

2304
01:38:09,119 --> 01:38:13,890
be a mess but for the most part yeah

2305
01:38:12,300 --> 01:38:15,600
it's just basically simplifying it

2306
01:38:13,890 --> 01:38:16,860
luckily the regulations have changed a

2307
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:19,620
little bit so now we can entertain

2308
01:38:16,859 --> 01:38:21,630
things like more that Korean national

2309
01:38:19,619 --> 01:38:23,069
farming techniques I'm aware before it

2310
01:38:21,630 --> 01:38:25,170
was a little bit more stringent with the

2311
01:38:23,069 --> 01:38:26,789
testing so as you and Josh know I

2312
01:38:25,170 --> 01:38:28,680
couldn't play with a lot of the folders

2313
01:38:26,789 --> 01:38:30,989
that microbial folders and things like

2314
01:38:28,680 --> 01:38:33,720
that I can only apply things to the soil

2315
01:38:30,989 --> 01:38:35,819
I had to be very conscious about our

2316
01:38:33,720 --> 01:38:38,970
environment overall like a lot of people

2317
01:38:35,819 --> 01:38:41,909
like to use the on the the DPD charts I

2318
01:38:38,970 --> 01:38:44,280
always mix it up my bed and run this

2319
01:38:41,909 --> 01:38:46,380
high high humidity indoors trying to get

2320
01:38:44,279 --> 01:38:49,649
these maximum maximum yields but I'm

2321
01:38:46,380 --> 01:38:51,779
sorry you will not pass a state test I'm

2322
01:38:49,649 --> 01:38:55,049
learning those humidity levels on indoor

2323
01:38:51,779 --> 01:38:57,000
flour and a regulated state so we've had

2324
01:38:55,050 --> 01:39:00,420
this learning curve and we've dabbled

2325
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:01,649
with a little bit of everything it's

2326
01:39:00,420 --> 01:39:02,909
been fun and you guys have been there

2327
01:39:01,649 --> 01:39:04,889
with me the whole time you know to help

2328
01:39:02,909 --> 01:39:08,880
me and every time we have an instant we

2329
01:39:04,890 --> 01:39:11,280
always keep you guys informed recently

2330
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:13,079
how that bulb actually explode and

2331
01:39:11,279 --> 01:39:15,960
almost burnt a whole room down

2332
01:39:13,079 --> 01:39:17,039
I definitely ruined a whole room but

2333
01:39:15,960 --> 01:39:19,170
that's one thing I definitely

2334
01:39:17,039 --> 01:39:20,760
informed you guys about so you guys can

2335
01:39:19,170 --> 01:39:24,270
definitely let them peer farmers know

2336
01:39:20,760 --> 01:39:25,680
that this HID bulbs definitely have some

2337
01:39:24,270 --> 01:39:28,260
issues you've got to be careful using

2338
01:39:25,680 --> 01:39:31,320
them and how we build these rooms when

2339
01:39:28,260 --> 01:39:34,260
I'm using this type of technology but

2340
01:39:31,319 --> 01:39:35,849
anyways beyond that yeah this been hard

2341
01:39:34,260 --> 01:39:38,280
has been working

2342
01:39:35,850 --> 01:39:41,160
we got an indoor cultivation in some

2343
01:39:38,279 --> 01:39:45,539
states is definitely a good thing some

2344
01:39:41,159 --> 01:39:48,038
in some states is definitely silly but

2345
01:39:45,539 --> 01:39:52,960
yeah here in Nevada we make it work

2346
01:39:48,038 --> 01:39:55,448
yeah bust crop loss is a real thing when

2347
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:56,408
you farm you know that's just that's

2348
01:39:55,448 --> 01:39:58,419
just a fact

2349
01:39:56,408 --> 01:40:01,238
whatever you farm if you farm something

2350
01:39:58,420 --> 01:40:02,859
crop loss is gonna be a possibility and

2351
01:40:01,238 --> 01:40:04,359
it always kind of made me laugh when I

2352
01:40:02,859 --> 01:40:07,509
looked at all these sort of business

2353
01:40:04,359 --> 01:40:10,479
proposals for these LPS and Canada none

2354
01:40:07,510 --> 01:40:14,949
of them in any of their decks had had

2355
01:40:10,479 --> 01:40:16,750
crop loss as you know something that can

2356
01:40:14,948 --> 01:40:18,009
happen it just wasn't a part of their

2357
01:40:16,750 --> 01:40:19,868
deck they had all these great numbers

2358
01:40:18,010 --> 01:40:21,400
you could make this you could do that

2359
01:40:19,868 --> 01:40:23,170
and it all worked out and it was just

2360
01:40:21,399 --> 01:40:25,689
like we're like are you taking into

2361
01:40:23,170 --> 01:40:27,489
account crop loss because that's it's

2362
01:40:25,689 --> 01:40:31,178
kind of a real thing as we've seen

2363
01:40:27,488 --> 01:40:34,509
recently with canopy losing the whole

2364
01:40:31,179 --> 01:40:36,010
crop now I don't think they lost it for

2365
01:40:34,510 --> 01:40:37,989
the reason that people think they lost

2366
01:40:36,010 --> 01:40:39,820
it I think they lost it because they did

2367
01:40:37,988 --> 01:40:42,129
not get a particular license that they

2368
01:40:39,819 --> 01:40:44,018
needed for processing that crop up and

2369
01:40:42,130 --> 01:40:45,760
so it ended up just sitting there not

2370
01:40:44,019 --> 01:40:47,679
getting harvested not going anywhere and

2371
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:50,980
drying up and dying but it was

2372
01:40:47,679 --> 01:40:55,989
definitely yeah a horrific sight to

2373
01:40:50,979 --> 01:40:58,299
behold about your LEDs and and where do

2374
01:40:55,988 --> 01:41:01,388
you think that LED technology is

2375
01:40:58,300 --> 01:41:04,059
nowadays because part of you know being

2376
01:41:01,389 --> 01:41:08,980
a say a conscious indoor farmers is

2377
01:41:04,059 --> 01:41:11,349
energy you know uptake and and LEDs are

2378
01:41:08,979 --> 01:41:14,049
definitely one of the things that can

2379
01:41:11,349 --> 01:41:17,440
bring your your all-around energy output

2380
01:41:14,050 --> 01:41:19,570
down how are you feeling about LEDs now

2381
01:41:17,439 --> 01:41:24,698
and what are some of the companies you

2382
01:41:19,569 --> 01:41:27,849
think are making good ones yeah almost

2383
01:41:24,698 --> 01:41:30,219
four years now huge fan of LEDs they're

2384
01:41:27,849 --> 01:41:31,869
definitely different as far as not only

2385
01:41:30,219 --> 01:41:35,380
how you build your grow room around them

2386
01:41:31,868 --> 01:41:37,359
but how you actually train in and your

2387
01:41:35,380 --> 01:41:41,529
plants and grow your plants underneath

2388
01:41:37,359 --> 01:41:43,509
them the energy efficiency is is is what

2389
01:41:41,529 --> 01:41:46,029
it is it's usually 50 percent less than

2390
01:41:43,510 --> 01:41:47,829
what a HID would be you don't quite get

2391
01:41:46,029 --> 01:41:49,750
the savings on the HVAC side because

2392
01:41:47,828 --> 01:41:51,009
what you lack in and cooling you're

2393
01:41:49,750 --> 01:41:52,689
still going to have to be human if I the

2394
01:41:51,010 --> 01:41:55,239
air in the indoor grow so you're still

2395
01:41:52,689 --> 01:41:56,979
gonna need tonnage to pull that moisture

2396
01:41:55,238 --> 01:41:59,279
out regardless of what you're doing

2397
01:41:56,979 --> 01:42:02,079
cooling it or not

2398
01:41:59,279 --> 01:42:04,000
but for the most part the LEDs it's a

2399
01:42:02,079 --> 01:42:05,140
learning curve recently had a big

2400
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,760
breakthrough we had some photo bleaching

2401
01:42:05,140 --> 01:42:08,619
with some of our older LEDs I've been

2402
01:42:06,760 --> 01:42:10,840
chased gone for a long time trying

2403
01:42:08,619 --> 01:42:12,519
several different brands out the older

2404
01:42:10,840 --> 01:42:13,270
heavy red LEDs definitely cost

2405
01:42:12,520 --> 01:42:15,160
photo-etching

2406
01:42:13,270 --> 01:42:16,360
I recently discovered I read a book and

2407
01:42:15,159 --> 01:42:19,420
saw some things about leaf surface

2408
01:42:16,359 --> 01:42:20,649
temperature basically the as long as you

2409
01:42:19,420 --> 01:42:22,000
bring your leaf surface temperature up

2410
01:42:20,649 --> 01:42:25,059
you can minimize the photo bleaching

2411
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:26,649
even with the old red LEDs but for the

2412
01:42:25,060 --> 01:42:28,390
most part the definitely the the

2413
01:42:26,649 --> 01:42:30,479
full-spectrum like what the fluence is

2414
01:42:28,390 --> 01:42:33,369
using and everybody's basically

2415
01:42:30,479 --> 01:42:35,679
following it is definitely the spectrum

2416
01:42:33,369 --> 01:42:37,449
to be playing with I know a luma text

2417
01:42:35,680 --> 01:42:39,430
I'm testing Denver's fluent right now

2418
01:42:37,449 --> 01:42:42,460
I'm also working with the company from

2419
01:42:39,430 --> 01:42:44,829
Las Vegas with several others and yeah

2420
01:42:42,460 --> 01:42:46,659
the full-spectrum it is a beautiful

2421
01:42:44,829 --> 01:42:48,220
beautiful lights to work with they're

2422
01:42:46,659 --> 01:42:50,380
very easy on the eyes

2423
01:42:48,220 --> 01:42:53,010
on the plant seem to love them are

2424
01:42:50,380 --> 01:42:55,750
healed I'm getting organically indoors

2425
01:42:53,010 --> 01:42:59,770
on average about a pound and a half or

2426
01:42:55,750 --> 01:43:00,970
4x4 with minimal minimal inputs I went

2427
01:42:59,770 --> 01:43:03,190
through kind of a minimal and put only

2428
01:43:00,970 --> 01:43:04,990
compost days for a while I'm now trying

2429
01:43:03,189 --> 01:43:06,759
to work with some SSDs again and things

2430
01:43:04,989 --> 01:43:09,279
of that nature but for the most part

2431
01:43:06,760 --> 01:43:12,760
minimal input maximum output in my

2432
01:43:09,279 --> 01:43:16,149
opinion so humans replicant knows do you

2433
01:43:12,760 --> 01:43:23,739
notice a difference not in vegetative

2434
01:43:16,149 --> 01:43:25,869
weights but in yields of resin uh resin

2435
01:43:23,739 --> 01:43:27,460
I can't say so in our Las Vegas is still

2436
01:43:25,869 --> 01:43:30,640
even running hid and we have some pretty

2437
01:43:27,460 --> 01:43:32,409
frosty flower but definitely turkeys I

2438
01:43:30,640 --> 01:43:33,970
feel like they're definitely more

2439
01:43:32,409 --> 01:43:37,750
flavorful no matter what our pure

2440
01:43:33,970 --> 01:43:39,130
process is my my pro facility definitely

2441
01:43:37,750 --> 01:43:40,720
always tastes better than my last date

2442
01:43:39,130 --> 01:43:41,890
Cecile and I feel like certain Kirkenes

2443
01:43:40,720 --> 01:43:45,460
are a little more about how the heat is

2444
01:43:41,890 --> 01:43:47,350
dressed on the gas out so I think I

2445
01:43:45,460 --> 01:43:50,319
probably definite taste a lot smoother

2446
01:43:47,350 --> 01:43:53,020
due to that that's the only thing I can

2447
01:43:50,319 --> 01:43:56,319
really point to that would mmm I haven't

2448
01:43:53,020 --> 01:43:59,860
seen LED yet produced the resin content

2449
01:43:56,319 --> 01:44:01,210
that an HP s can produce I want to I've

2450
01:43:59,859 --> 01:44:02,589
definitely seen some impressive things

2451
01:44:01,210 --> 01:44:06,189
from LED lights

2452
01:44:02,590 --> 01:44:07,960
half the half the amperage you know half

2453
01:44:06,189 --> 01:44:09,849
the half the lights in the room same

2454
01:44:07,960 --> 01:44:12,340
yields vegetatively

2455
01:44:09,850 --> 01:44:14,200
but I'm not sure about the resin yeah

2456
01:44:12,340 --> 01:44:15,850
I'm not sure that I've seen and here's

2457
01:44:14,199 --> 01:44:18,010
another interesting fact I get that

2458
01:44:15,850 --> 01:44:21,220
maybe a hotter room would potentially be

2459
01:44:18,010 --> 01:44:23,289
thought of to have less terpenes yet why

2460
01:44:21,220 --> 01:44:26,020
is it in skunkman Sam maybe you can

2461
01:44:23,289 --> 01:44:29,289
speak on this why is all the tastiest

2462
01:44:26,020 --> 01:44:32,740
firm I've ever tasted come out of an

2463
01:44:29,289 --> 01:44:36,340
exotic farm somewhere in Jamaica or

2464
01:44:32,739 --> 01:44:39,369
another hot country where the it's so

2465
01:44:36,340 --> 01:44:42,720
hot like for ten hours or 12 hours this

2466
01:44:39,369 --> 01:44:45,189
plant is just under the tropical Sun

2467
01:44:42,720 --> 01:44:46,420
beating down on it in a way that you

2468
01:44:45,189 --> 01:44:48,879
just think how could there be any

2469
01:44:46,420 --> 01:44:51,279
terpenes and that thing left in those

2470
01:44:48,880 --> 01:44:53,710
temperatures consistently all day every

2471
01:44:51,279 --> 01:44:56,559
day yet some of the nicest hatch I've

2472
01:44:53,710 --> 01:44:59,500
ever made was was from that country that

2473
01:44:56,560 --> 01:45:02,320
the most Terp rich product I've pretty

2474
01:44:59,500 --> 01:45:06,869
much smoked came from an outdoor field

2475
01:45:02,319 --> 01:45:11,769
that was very very very hot

2476
01:45:06,869 --> 01:45:14,890
any idea Sam I don't know really what to

2477
01:45:11,770 --> 01:45:17,800
say exactly because it it would have

2478
01:45:14,890 --> 01:45:22,660
been nice to have a clone of that same

2479
01:45:17,800 --> 01:45:26,289
plant that was grown under lights or in

2480
01:45:22,659 --> 01:45:28,899
a greenhouse protected deceit would it

2481
01:45:26,289 --> 01:45:34,000
have been even higher in Turkey than

2482
01:45:28,899 --> 01:45:39,509
right i but yeah yeah I do agree that I

2483
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:42,489
like the taste of tropical magic but I

2484
01:45:39,510 --> 01:45:43,869
yeah yeah you know that that leads us

2485
01:45:42,489 --> 01:45:45,460
into something that we think would be

2486
01:45:43,869 --> 01:45:47,500
really valuable there is a thing called

2487
01:45:45,460 --> 01:45:49,359
the grow-op that's happening in Northern

2488
01:45:47,500 --> 01:45:51,010
California and it's happened in Colorado

2489
01:45:49,359 --> 01:45:53,109
and it's really interesting because they

2490
01:45:51,010 --> 01:45:58,930
take the is that from the grow off there

2491
01:45:53,109 --> 01:46:00,429
Craig they you know they took one clone

2492
01:45:58,930 --> 01:46:02,050
and gave it out to all different farmers

2493
01:46:00,430 --> 01:46:07,960
and they're doing a contest on

2494
01:46:02,050 --> 01:46:12,699
cannabinoids and terpenoids down further

2495
01:46:07,960 --> 01:46:15,159
and get soil tests from that so that we

2496
01:46:12,699 --> 01:46:17,050
could and also get a list of the inputs

2497
01:46:15,159 --> 01:46:18,729
that went into it because I think it

2498
01:46:17,050 --> 01:46:23,289
would be incredibly valuable to be able

2499
01:46:18,729 --> 01:46:25,549
to test the soil the inputs and then in

2500
01:46:23,289 --> 01:46:28,578
comparison with the cannabinoids and

2501
01:46:25,550 --> 01:46:31,159
terpenes so Josh and I are partnering

2502
01:46:28,578 --> 01:46:33,139
with Ethan Russo right now and asking

2503
01:46:31,158 --> 01:46:34,848
just these questions you know what is

2504
01:46:33,139 --> 01:46:36,618
the difference between all of these

2505
01:46:34,849 --> 01:46:39,380
different types of growing mediums

2506
01:46:36,618 --> 01:46:41,210
different areas that are growing so

2507
01:46:39,380 --> 01:46:43,010
we're going to take the top winners and

2508
01:46:41,210 --> 01:46:45,020
that grow off and we're going to ask

2509
01:46:43,010 --> 01:46:47,150
them a lot of multiple questions on

2510
01:46:45,020 --> 01:46:50,389
where it was grown how it was grown what

2511
01:46:47,149 --> 01:46:52,789
kind of mediums that you utilized you

2512
01:46:50,389 --> 01:46:54,679
know what what kind of teas did you use

2513
01:46:52,789 --> 01:46:57,260
did you have it you know in a green

2514
01:46:54,679 --> 01:46:58,220
house light up and really maybe try to

2515
01:46:57,260 --> 01:47:00,070
get you know some

2516
01:46:58,220 --> 01:47:01,940
[Music]

2517
01:47:00,069 --> 01:47:03,799
information from that and what are some

2518
01:47:01,939 --> 01:47:05,659
of the insights you have on that Sam cuz

2519
01:47:03,800 --> 01:47:07,369
we know that you have you know the most

2520
01:47:05,659 --> 01:47:09,319
experience out of anyone probably on

2521
01:47:07,369 --> 01:47:10,939
just you know being able to work with

2522
01:47:09,319 --> 01:47:16,880
say a clone in many different

2523
01:47:10,939 --> 01:47:19,339
environments well of course you need all

2524
01:47:16,880 --> 01:47:23,000
the environmental conditions you know

2525
01:47:19,340 --> 01:47:28,480
whether it's high humidity low humidity

2526
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:32,000
daily along with the photo periods the

2527
01:47:28,479 --> 01:47:36,439
temperatures the are those kinds of

2528
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:41,600
questions the water source and most

2529
01:47:36,439 --> 01:47:43,729
people don't grow in native soil so in

2530
01:47:41,600 --> 01:47:46,250
theory you couldn't even get the growers

2531
01:47:43,729 --> 01:47:48,889
to use all the same soil if you're just

2532
01:47:46,250 --> 01:47:51,350
trying to test the growers but if you're

2533
01:47:48,890 --> 01:47:53,450
trying to test what makes cannabis

2534
01:47:51,350 --> 01:47:55,820
better that you probably want

2535
01:47:53,449 --> 01:47:58,488
differences so that you can find one

2536
01:47:55,819 --> 01:48:00,949
that's better yeah I think that would be

2537
01:47:58,488 --> 01:48:02,839
the idea you know is to say you know

2538
01:48:00,949 --> 01:48:04,639
people who I said oh the organic that

2539
01:48:02,840 --> 01:48:05,869
tastes better or we know let's you know

2540
01:48:04,640 --> 01:48:08,210
all this stuff and I think it's because

2541
01:48:05,869 --> 01:48:09,619
the microorganisms in the soil and I

2542
01:48:08,210 --> 01:48:11,930
think that you made a good point with

2543
01:48:09,619 --> 01:48:13,670
the atmosphere and stuff I'd also like

2544
01:48:11,930 --> 01:48:15,829
to point out I mean part of the the pure

2545
01:48:13,670 --> 01:48:18,739
certification is to grow in native soil

2546
01:48:15,829 --> 01:48:23,420
and to have those you know that local

2547
01:48:18,738 --> 01:48:26,929
terroir or appellation you know present

2548
01:48:23,420 --> 01:48:29,359
and to be able to show how it can bring

2549
01:48:26,930 --> 01:48:31,460
diversity to a final product into a

2550
01:48:29,359 --> 01:48:36,679
flower for us would be the goal I don't

2551
01:48:31,460 --> 01:48:39,050
think that we have a and you know thing

2552
01:48:36,680 --> 01:48:40,369
that we we have inside on what we think

2553
01:48:39,050 --> 01:48:42,739
it might be but it'd be really cool to

2554
01:48:40,369 --> 01:48:44,059
see how the flower changes in all the

2555
01:48:42,738 --> 01:48:45,709
different environments and I think it

2556
01:48:44,060 --> 01:48:47,630
could end up being that you know the

2557
01:48:45,710 --> 01:48:49,279
ecologically responsible way of growing

2558
01:48:47,630 --> 01:48:52,159
is actually gonna produce a better

2559
01:48:49,279 --> 01:48:53,599
flower and also you know with this grow

2560
01:48:52,159 --> 01:48:55,819
off there are going to be a tremendous

2561
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:58,760
amount of people that are growing in

2562
01:48:55,819 --> 01:49:00,559
northern Cali soil and terroir and maybe

2563
01:48:58,760 --> 01:49:01,970
we could bring it over to Craig Craig do

2564
01:49:00,560 --> 01:49:03,680
you got your microphone on I know that

2565
01:49:01,970 --> 01:49:05,210
you're part of this grow off I know that

2566
01:49:03,680 --> 01:49:08,239
you're a really active community member

2567
01:49:05,210 --> 01:49:13,489
in this you got your mic on come here ya

2568
01:49:08,238 --> 01:49:15,768
know if you can't

2569
01:49:13,488 --> 01:49:17,899
he can balance income right oh there it

2570
01:49:15,769 --> 01:49:19,280
is you figured it out dude all right

2571
01:49:17,899 --> 01:49:31,808
beautiful

2572
01:49:19,279 --> 01:49:38,259
I have nothing we can hear you

2573
01:49:31,809 --> 01:49:40,880
mic is on fantastic yeah I don't know if

2574
01:49:38,260 --> 01:49:43,340
any of you guys know me but yeah i'm

2575
01:49:40,880 --> 01:49:45,739
craig from alpenglow and I've been up

2576
01:49:43,340 --> 01:49:49,309
here in Humboldt County for about 27 28

2577
01:49:45,738 --> 01:49:51,529
years and done it every way possible you

2578
01:49:49,309 --> 01:49:53,320
know from growing under the trees all

2579
01:49:51,529 --> 01:49:56,448
the way through the whole gamut of

2580
01:49:53,319 --> 01:49:59,658
proposition 215 in the front yard to

2581
01:49:56,448 --> 01:50:03,229
where we're at now with state state

2582
01:49:59,658 --> 01:50:04,969
temporary permits but uh yeah about

2583
01:50:03,229 --> 01:50:06,529
three years ago we realized we could

2584
01:50:04,969 --> 01:50:09,198
come out of the green closet and engage

2585
01:50:06,529 --> 01:50:11,420
with Josh and Kelly and and all these

2586
01:50:09,198 --> 01:50:13,578
other minds out there by a vortex and

2587
01:50:11,420 --> 01:50:15,889
haitai permaculture and all these folks

2588
01:50:13,578 --> 01:50:19,368
can gather this knowledge and kind of

2589
01:50:15,889 --> 01:50:22,489
put a glossary list to a lot of these

2590
01:50:19,368 --> 01:50:25,960
practices that we already had so now

2591
01:50:22,488 --> 01:50:29,058
that brings us to really engaging into

2592
01:50:25,960 --> 01:50:31,550
what we would define our to our and our

2593
01:50:29,059 --> 01:50:33,920
appalachian and we're going to great

2594
01:50:31,550 --> 01:50:37,429
lengths now to promote our Benbow

2595
01:50:33,920 --> 01:50:39,109
appalachian and and it really you know

2596
01:50:37,429 --> 01:50:41,239
there there is a reason why southern

2597
01:50:39,109 --> 01:50:43,279
Humboldt and the Emerald triangle has

2598
01:50:41,238 --> 01:50:46,038
been on the map on the global map for so

2599
01:50:43,279 --> 01:50:48,788
long and that that is our two-wire

2600
01:50:46,038 --> 01:50:53,389
appalachian or climate it's this region

2601
01:50:48,788 --> 01:50:55,518
that like no other we we get the cool

2602
01:50:53,389 --> 01:50:56,989
nights we get the scorching hot days

2603
01:50:55,519 --> 01:50:59,599
like you guys were talking about earlier

2604
01:50:56,988 --> 01:51:02,689
like in those tropical places and it

2605
01:50:59,599 --> 01:51:06,170
just brings out the terpenes and it goes

2606
01:51:02,689 --> 01:51:08,419
beyond beyond just the growing and the

2607
01:51:06,170 --> 01:51:14,480
growing season but our curing season as

2608
01:51:08,420 --> 01:51:17,510
well we're using minimal technology I

2609
01:51:14,479 --> 01:51:19,578
guess or environmental controls to even

2610
01:51:17,510 --> 01:51:22,309
finish off our product we're letting the

2611
01:51:19,578 --> 01:51:25,038
the dry air of the day come through our

2612
01:51:22,309 --> 01:51:26,748
buildings and and dry and cure and then

2613
01:51:25,038 --> 01:51:27,380
if it comes to the other level we can

2614
01:51:26,748 --> 01:51:28,760
open up some

2615
01:51:27,380 --> 01:51:31,489
doors or windows and bring in some of

2616
01:51:28,760 --> 01:51:32,929
that moist ocean air at night to kind of

2617
01:51:31,488 --> 01:51:37,698
bring a nice balance to do a nice cure

2618
01:51:32,929 --> 01:51:41,869
and yeah we are we are engaging deep

2619
01:51:37,698 --> 01:51:43,908
into bringing our native to our even

2620
01:51:41,869 --> 01:51:48,769
into our greenhouses we're gathering

2621
01:51:43,908 --> 01:51:50,750
forests houmous and our local fractured

2622
01:51:48,770 --> 01:51:52,580
shale that spills off our steep

2623
01:51:50,750 --> 01:51:54,408
mountainsides here and we're bringing

2624
01:51:52,579 --> 01:51:56,719
all that and even into our greenhouses

2625
01:51:54,408 --> 01:51:59,420
building Google beds in our greenhouses

2626
01:51:56,719 --> 01:52:01,069
and even our greenhouses that you know

2627
01:51:59,420 --> 01:52:03,050
it's not like not like you're gonna

2628
01:52:01,069 --> 01:52:05,119
think a greenhouse in BC or northern

2629
01:52:03,050 --> 01:52:07,670
Washington these are these are just

2630
01:52:05,119 --> 01:52:09,948
essentially a cover with the doors

2631
01:52:07,670 --> 01:52:12,500
rolled up those side walls all rolled up

2632
01:52:09,948 --> 01:52:15,229
and it's it's really just a way for our

2633
01:52:12,500 --> 01:52:18,408
light DEP to are to light up covered not

2634
01:52:15,229 --> 01:52:19,968
to drop dust or soil on to the to the

2635
01:52:18,408 --> 01:52:22,279
canopy of the plants it's they're really

2636
01:52:19,969 --> 01:52:24,859
open air and we're able to still pull

2637
01:52:22,279 --> 01:52:27,170
off two to three light-up

2638
01:52:24,859 --> 01:52:29,948
runs that way we prefer to because those

2639
01:52:27,170 --> 01:52:32,719
that third doesn't really work so good

2640
01:52:29,948 --> 01:52:35,960
but yeah kind of loop back into the grow

2641
01:52:32,719 --> 01:52:38,689
off yeah that that is really interesting

2642
01:52:35,960 --> 01:52:42,079
we're seeing what Jacob up at flower

2643
01:52:38,689 --> 01:52:43,969
days is doing he he in our local area I

2644
01:52:42,079 --> 01:52:48,710
think is pushing it as hard as can be

2645
01:52:43,969 --> 01:52:50,510
them in moon gazers with really maximum

2646
01:52:48,710 --> 01:52:51,889
allowing to closed loops it's it's

2647
01:52:50,510 --> 01:52:55,150
pretty mind-blowing what those guys are

2648
01:52:51,889 --> 01:52:57,350
doing just straight off their farms

2649
01:52:55,149 --> 01:52:58,819
we're closing loops but we have to reach

2650
01:52:57,350 --> 01:53:03,440
a little further we're trying to stay

2651
01:52:58,819 --> 01:53:05,569
within Humboldt County and then if we

2652
01:53:03,439 --> 01:53:08,539
have to reach we'll reach as far as like

2653
01:53:05,569 --> 01:53:11,809
Petaluma forced some of our chicken

2654
01:53:08,539 --> 01:53:13,310
inputs if we need them but yeah we're

2655
01:53:11,810 --> 01:53:15,289
really trying to work with what we have

2656
01:53:13,310 --> 01:53:18,409
here and we did have two plants and to

2657
01:53:15,289 --> 01:53:20,960
grow off we didn't really it's gonna be

2658
01:53:18,408 --> 01:53:23,059
really interesting because they I'm kind

2659
01:53:20,960 --> 01:53:25,789
of calling from though love they were

2660
01:53:23,060 --> 01:53:28,039
kind of really not a priority we were so

2661
01:53:25,789 --> 01:53:32,060
busy with some of these other nuances of

2662
01:53:28,039 --> 01:53:36,039
the summer of permitting and re

2663
01:53:32,060 --> 01:53:40,159
permitting and and chasing chasing that

2664
01:53:36,039 --> 01:53:41,060
legal market we had it in California you

2665
01:53:40,158 --> 01:53:42,979
know I don't want to go off

2666
01:53:41,060 --> 01:53:46,250
too far into this but it's a lot of what

2667
01:53:42,979 --> 01:53:47,869
the story is and the plight of the small

2668
01:53:46,250 --> 01:53:50,569
farmer right now they gave us a

2669
01:53:47,869 --> 01:53:52,579
temporary permit we planted our seeds we

2670
01:53:50,569 --> 01:53:53,869
got going and that temporary permit

2671
01:53:52,579 --> 01:53:57,140
expires by the time we were ready to

2672
01:53:53,869 --> 01:53:59,569
harvest so instead of having a seed to

2673
01:53:57,140 --> 01:54:01,250
sale temporary permit it was just for

2674
01:53:59,569 --> 01:54:02,989
three months they didn't really think

2675
01:54:01,250 --> 01:54:04,159
that through we got the airplanes up in

2676
01:54:02,989 --> 01:54:06,859
the air and then they shut down two

2677
01:54:04,159 --> 01:54:08,210
runways so we were kind of locked out of

2678
01:54:06,859 --> 01:54:10,039
the legal market for a little while

2679
01:54:08,210 --> 01:54:15,140
until we could shuffle some more

2680
01:54:10,039 --> 01:54:16,640
paperwork but uh yeah I don't I maybe

2681
01:54:15,140 --> 01:54:18,680
you guys lead me into if you guys have

2682
01:54:16,640 --> 01:54:19,970
some other questions or so but what are

2683
01:54:18,680 --> 01:54:22,100
some of the things with the grow off

2684
01:54:19,970 --> 01:54:23,810
that they're they they've given out the

2685
01:54:22,100 --> 01:54:27,800
clone and then what's the process after

2686
01:54:23,810 --> 01:54:30,470
after harvest with that yeah so I

2687
01:54:27,800 --> 01:54:33,619
haven't engaged beyond that I have an

2688
01:54:30,470 --> 01:54:36,170
email waiting right now to get the

2689
01:54:33,619 --> 01:54:38,960
probably the lab paperwork in line and

2690
01:54:36,170 --> 01:54:43,480
transport documents and so forth but

2691
01:54:38,960 --> 01:54:47,119
ours is still curing we we do this whole

2692
01:54:43,479 --> 01:54:50,479
curing room setup where we've had ours

2693
01:54:47,119 --> 01:54:53,390
down for about 3-4 weeks so in my mind

2694
01:54:50,479 --> 01:54:57,500
it's almost ready I like to get it for

2695
01:54:53,390 --> 01:55:00,440
four to eight man preferably three four

2696
01:54:57,500 --> 01:55:02,270
month care personally but I'm gonna try

2697
01:55:00,439 --> 01:55:05,109
to hold on to that on the farm as long

2698
01:55:02,270 --> 01:55:08,570
as I can before I get it off to the lab

2699
01:55:05,109 --> 01:55:10,250
nice woman another question I think is

2700
01:55:08,569 --> 01:55:13,159
really interesting is just some of the

2701
01:55:10,250 --> 01:55:15,680
you know the exposure you've been able

2702
01:55:13,159 --> 01:55:17,720
to get on your farm in order to get your

2703
01:55:15,680 --> 01:55:19,730
name out there in order to be able to

2704
01:55:17,720 --> 01:55:21,530
you know have sales and all that that's

2705
01:55:19,729 --> 01:55:23,899
kind of difficult for all of us I think

2706
01:55:21,529 --> 01:55:25,880
all of us we try and put a lot into our

2707
01:55:23,899 --> 01:55:27,739
farm but then we're also realizing how

2708
01:55:25,880 --> 01:55:29,869
much you know bringing out your name

2709
01:55:27,739 --> 01:55:31,789
forward is gonna mean something in the

2710
01:55:29,869 --> 01:55:33,769
future out and and so how did it go with

2711
01:55:31,789 --> 01:55:35,269
the Chocolate Company and and what are

2712
01:55:33,770 --> 01:55:37,280
some of the other things that you know

2713
01:55:35,270 --> 01:55:39,590
you've you've done you've done that some

2714
01:55:37,279 --> 01:55:42,769
of the TV work and and tell us a little

2715
01:55:39,590 --> 01:55:44,659
bit about what you're doing on that you

2716
01:55:42,770 --> 01:55:47,560
know what we focus on we don't really

2717
01:55:44,659 --> 01:55:50,689
focus on promoting alpenglow

2718
01:55:47,560 --> 01:55:55,400
specifically we focus on promoting our

2719
01:55:50,689 --> 01:55:58,519
region we we look at promoting

2720
01:55:55,399 --> 01:56:03,769
the Dampier the dumpier certification is

2721
01:55:58,520 --> 01:56:06,410
way so heavy in these new markets we we

2722
01:56:03,770 --> 01:56:09,350
didn't really realize the value of it at

2723
01:56:06,409 --> 01:56:12,710
the beginning other than an emotional

2724
01:56:09,350 --> 01:56:14,240
and a feel-good value to know that we're

2725
01:56:12,710 --> 01:56:15,859
doing right and it's been recognized

2726
01:56:14,239 --> 01:56:19,250
after all these years so that feels

2727
01:56:15,859 --> 01:56:22,519
really good but lift literally now it's

2728
01:56:19,250 --> 01:56:27,170
whether whether it's a retail partner at

2729
01:56:22,520 --> 01:56:30,290
soulful down in in Sebastopol Eli he he

2730
01:56:27,170 --> 01:56:38,029
that he sources primarily from dem pure

2731
01:56:30,289 --> 01:56:43,100
farmers or bio slipped my mind for a

2732
01:56:38,029 --> 01:56:47,750
minute but uh biodynamic biodynamic

2733
01:56:43,100 --> 01:56:50,539
thank you yeah but yeah so between Eli

2734
01:56:47,750 --> 01:56:53,960
and and and then that having having that

2735
01:56:50,539 --> 01:56:58,670
damn pure seal is so valuable as time

2736
01:56:53,960 --> 01:57:02,989
goes on and the Chocolate Company found

2737
01:56:58,670 --> 01:57:05,659
us through that same process and and you

2738
01:57:02,989 --> 01:57:07,369
know we go we go live on Instagram we're

2739
01:57:05,659 --> 01:57:09,079
just walking around our garden we're

2740
01:57:07,369 --> 01:57:11,930
putting our hands in our soil we're just

2741
01:57:09,079 --> 01:57:14,539
holding up worms and and just showing

2742
01:57:11,930 --> 01:57:18,140
the process and having having the public

2743
01:57:14,539 --> 01:57:20,949
have a intimate relationship with our

2744
01:57:18,140 --> 01:57:23,900
soil even though they're in Missouri and

2745
01:57:20,949 --> 01:57:27,710
you know we had guys from Philly stalk

2746
01:57:23,899 --> 01:57:29,899
me on Instagram and I held them off as

2747
01:57:27,710 --> 01:57:32,090
long as I could I sent them to soulful

2748
01:57:29,899 --> 01:57:33,979
they sent me pictures of them smoking

2749
01:57:32,090 --> 01:57:36,199
joints outside their rental car and then

2750
01:57:33,979 --> 01:57:39,500
two months later they found her way up

2751
01:57:36,199 --> 01:57:44,090
to our farm so people are really

2752
01:57:39,500 --> 01:57:45,890
interested and and really really the

2753
01:57:44,090 --> 01:57:50,539
pathway consumer really wants to know

2754
01:57:45,890 --> 01:57:54,170
how their medicine has grown and I think

2755
01:57:50,539 --> 01:57:56,569
I think the humble humble in the Emerald

2756
01:57:54,170 --> 01:57:59,510
triangle we we have so many farmers that

2757
01:57:56,569 --> 01:58:01,759
have best practices but there's been so

2758
01:57:59,510 --> 01:58:05,840
much negative press around trespass grow

2759
01:58:01,760 --> 01:58:08,090
specifically and a lot of the folks that

2760
01:58:05,840 --> 01:58:10,550
showed up here that didn't have

2761
01:58:08,090 --> 01:58:14,600
those deeper roots and the care for the

2762
01:58:10,550 --> 01:58:17,210
land so as we show that the the consumer

2763
01:58:14,600 --> 01:58:18,500
is just reaching for it as well it's

2764
01:58:17,210 --> 01:58:20,600
almost like we have to just give

2765
01:58:18,500 --> 01:58:22,489
ourselves time and I think that you know

2766
01:58:20,600 --> 01:58:24,730
I think Marcus feels this way I think we

2767
01:58:22,489 --> 01:58:27,579
do too you know we're up here in Canada

2768
01:58:24,729 --> 01:58:30,079
you know we're looking at this market

2769
01:58:27,579 --> 01:58:32,390
we're listening to all the stories in

2770
01:58:30,079 --> 01:58:33,680
Washington Oregon all these different

2771
01:58:32,390 --> 01:58:35,150
places I should we haven't heard from

2772
01:58:33,680 --> 01:58:36,800
the smella grasses yet there they were

2773
01:58:35,149 --> 01:58:39,739
gonna maybe come you're gonna get out of

2774
01:58:36,800 --> 01:58:41,930
the Lord again but uh anyway it's it's

2775
01:58:39,739 --> 01:58:43,699
extremely difficult and I think that you

2776
01:58:41,930 --> 01:58:45,289
know that's where we we totally agree

2777
01:58:43,699 --> 01:58:48,800
with what Marcus said in the beginning

2778
01:58:45,289 --> 01:58:51,050
and and it's just this it's it's in

2779
01:58:48,800 --> 01:58:53,119
every state you're landlocked you know

2780
01:58:51,050 --> 01:58:54,680
you're almost land in California's and

2781
01:58:53,119 --> 01:58:56,989
from what Wade was saying is that you're

2782
01:58:54,680 --> 01:58:58,610
almost landlocked in each county and

2783
01:58:56,989 --> 01:59:01,760
Indians you haven't Highland and in

2784
01:58:58,609 --> 01:59:03,170
every county in California and I feel in

2785
01:59:01,760 --> 01:59:04,909
my heart me and Kelly have always

2786
01:59:03,170 --> 01:59:08,079
thought this you know I think that we

2787
01:59:04,909 --> 01:59:11,479
just need to stay in business and and

2788
01:59:08,079 --> 01:59:13,850
continue our mission you know over the

2789
01:59:11,479 --> 01:59:15,619
next few years because I just want to

2790
01:59:13,850 --> 01:59:18,020
believe that it's gonna that it's going

2791
01:59:15,619 --> 01:59:19,489
to open up you know that you everyone in

2792
01:59:18,020 --> 01:59:21,830
this getting people in America are gonna

2793
01:59:19,489 --> 01:59:24,559
be able to sell to anyone in America and

2794
01:59:21,829 --> 01:59:27,109
and then the world because we are seeing

2795
01:59:24,560 --> 01:59:29,150
that here in Canada we are talking to

2796
01:59:27,109 --> 01:59:32,059
licensed producers and we've had lots of

2797
01:59:29,149 --> 01:59:35,239
meetings and and they have the ability

2798
01:59:32,060 --> 01:59:37,160
to sell to 30 different countries you

2799
01:59:35,239 --> 01:59:40,489
know on a medicinal level with certain

2800
01:59:37,159 --> 01:59:42,079
products so we are seeing the light you

2801
01:59:40,489 --> 01:59:44,449
know in a sense and I feel like it's

2802
01:59:42,079 --> 01:59:47,029
worth us putting in this effort even

2803
01:59:44,449 --> 01:59:50,359
though it feels you know a little bit

2804
01:59:47,029 --> 01:59:52,670
like joining forces with something I

2805
01:59:50,359 --> 01:59:54,380
want something really large and I think

2806
01:59:52,670 --> 01:59:56,720
that it's really important too you know

2807
01:59:54,380 --> 01:59:58,550
it's like we're looking at this as if

2808
01:59:56,720 --> 02:00:01,909
you look at it a holistic level then you

2809
01:59:58,550 --> 02:00:03,920
have to have tegrity for your business

2810
02:00:01,909 --> 02:00:05,539
you have to have it for your community

2811
02:00:03,920 --> 02:00:08,210
you have to have it to the plant and

2812
02:00:05,539 --> 02:00:09,920
also you know to your bank account and

2813
02:00:08,210 --> 02:00:12,680
how is it that you can continue moving

2814
02:00:09,920 --> 02:00:14,690
forward and I think that you know if we

2815
02:00:12,680 --> 02:00:17,450
are able to fill all of those different

2816
02:00:14,689 --> 02:00:19,729
facets with so many of you here today on

2817
02:00:17,449 --> 02:00:21,859
the panel are doing and you're having

2818
02:00:19,729 --> 02:00:24,109
credible success with that and I think

2819
02:00:21,859 --> 02:00:26,119
and I'm really encouraging other farmers

2820
02:00:24,109 --> 02:00:29,299
to you know look at sort of full

2821
02:00:26,119 --> 02:00:31,399
spectrum and and start to focus outside

2822
02:00:29,300 --> 02:00:33,860
of their farm into their community and

2823
02:00:31,399 --> 02:00:35,449
to the people around them as well as

2824
02:00:33,859 --> 02:00:37,460
getting their name out there and telling

2825
02:00:35,449 --> 02:00:39,619
the story of their farm and that's where

2826
02:00:37,460 --> 02:00:42,289
you know we talk about sacred commerce I

2827
02:00:39,619 --> 02:00:44,689
mean yeah we're a corporation but it's

2828
02:00:42,289 --> 02:00:47,269
the energy behind our corporation that

2829
02:00:44,689 --> 02:00:49,250
makes us different so you know if we're

2830
02:00:47,270 --> 02:00:51,380
gonna take lessons from the United Fruit

2831
02:00:49,250 --> 02:00:54,220
Company in Central America and they're

2832
02:00:51,380 --> 02:00:56,720
over take of all the banana farms or

2833
02:00:54,220 --> 02:00:58,820
salty kind of--they farms and how they

2834
02:00:56,720 --> 02:01:01,159
you know they overtake anyone I feel in

2835
02:00:58,819 --> 02:01:03,049
my heart like you know that I have this

2836
02:01:01,159 --> 02:01:05,420
we have this bond with the cannabis

2837
02:01:03,050 --> 02:01:07,369
plant that's like this magical cultural

2838
02:01:05,420 --> 02:01:10,850
thing that will never go away and it's

2839
02:01:07,369 --> 02:01:12,738
just how can we keep that quality in

2840
02:01:10,850 --> 02:01:14,630
this market moving forward I mean it's

2841
02:01:12,738 --> 02:01:17,329
pretty much what we think about all day

2842
02:01:14,630 --> 02:01:19,369
long and how can we continue to have

2843
02:01:17,329 --> 02:01:21,319
equality in this and and if we could

2844
02:01:19,369 --> 02:01:23,750
help and help here a large you know

2845
02:01:21,319 --> 02:01:25,849
corporate grower grow more consciously I

2846
02:01:23,750 --> 02:01:28,909
mean we'll do it we would do you know

2847
02:01:25,850 --> 02:01:31,880

2858
02:02:00,289 --> 02:02:03,829
talking a little bit about the grow off

2859
02:02:01,880 --> 02:02:06,829
and I know that you guys are a part of

2860
02:02:03,829 --> 02:02:09,079
that too and what kind of um you know

2861
02:02:06,829 --> 02:02:11,059
things are you all doing you know with

2862
02:02:09,079 --> 02:02:12,979
that particular plant are you doing

2863
02:02:11,060 --> 02:02:15,890
anything special or you joining with

2864
02:02:12,979 --> 02:02:19,750
community members and tell us a little

2865
02:02:15,890 --> 02:02:21,340
bit about that well we

2866
02:02:19,750 --> 02:02:23,020
actually haven't done we actually did

2867
02:02:21,340 --> 02:02:27,789
not get that plant from the girl off

2868
02:02:23,020 --> 02:02:29,170
there you go good have though and I hope

2869
02:02:27,789 --> 02:02:32,800
they have to do it again it sounds

2870
02:02:29,170 --> 02:02:34,810
really fun and I would love to see how

2871
02:02:32,800 --> 02:02:37,420
our soil is translating to that plant

2872
02:02:34,810 --> 02:02:40,740
for sure there's definitely been a lot

2873
02:02:37,420 --> 02:02:43,720
of talk around here about foreign co-ops

2874
02:02:40,739 --> 02:02:45,609
so a lot of us are kind of getting

2875
02:02:43,720 --> 02:02:49,900
together and just sort of learning what

2876
02:02:45,609 --> 02:02:53,769
that is and you know hopefully when it

2877
02:02:49,899 --> 02:02:55,809
does come to a point when we can sell

2878
02:02:53,770 --> 02:02:58,630
across state lines will be organized

2879
02:02:55,810 --> 02:03:02,490
enough where the small farmers can unite

2880
02:02:58,630 --> 02:03:06,880
and together we can sell to you know

2881
02:03:02,489 --> 02:03:10,119
sell to the big so you know in quantity

2882
02:03:06,880 --> 02:03:12,670
and to a broader market and I think you

2883
02:03:10,119 --> 02:03:14,739
know are really important we've uh you

2884
02:03:12,670 --> 02:03:16,300
know we're working with the coop up here

2885
02:03:14,739 --> 02:03:19,329
in British Columbia called the Cascadia

2886
02:03:16,300 --> 02:03:21,640
coop and it's a way to collectively

2887
02:03:19,329 --> 02:03:24,460
bargain and to collectively represent

2888
02:03:21,640 --> 02:03:26,860
each other in order to see you know

2889
02:03:24,460 --> 02:03:30,699

2890

at the forefront of Education with your

2897
02:03:42,579 --> 02:03:48,220
consumers as well as the farmers in your

2898

just really quickly love to ask I mean

2901
02:03:51,729 --> 02:03:57,219
you guys do have a biodynamic farm a

2902
02:03:54,430 --> 02:03:59,770
pure certified farm I think it's done in

2903
02:03:57,220 --> 02:04:03,460
certified farm and I think that uh you

2904
02:03:59,770 --> 02:04:06,340
guys really show that you are you know

2905

2906
02:04:06,340 --> 02:04:09,670
food everywhere I know that you've been

2907

2908

other I'd love to hear you know just

2909
02:04:11,890 --> 02:04:15,100

2910
02:04:13,659 --> 02:04:16,449
brought you towards that and how it's

helping your business maybe you know on

2912
02:04:16,449 --> 02:04:21,130
a cost way maybe on a feel-good way I'm

2913
02:04:19,239 --> 02:04:25,569
tell us some of your experiences with

2914
02:04:21,130 --> 02:04:27,940
that yes you know it being a biodynamic

2915
02:04:25,569 --> 02:04:30,699
farm and a DM pure certified farm I mean

2916
02:04:27,939 --> 02:04:32,619
you know a lot a regenerative cannabis

2917
02:04:30,699 --> 02:04:33,340
farm award the Emerald cup which you

2918
02:04:32,619 --> 02:04:36,220
guys also

2919
02:04:33,340 --> 02:04:37,779
receive that year and I mean we

2920
02:04:36,220 --> 02:04:39,760
basically are just sticking with our

2921
02:04:37,779 --> 02:04:41,590
ethos I mean you know we got to

2922
02:04:39,760 --> 02:04:43,510
Mendocino County and we were working up

2923
02:04:41,590 --> 02:04:45,670
at the the fried vineyards at their

2924
02:04:43,510 --> 02:04:48,489
biodynamic farm and we were growing lots

2925
02:04:45,670 --> 02:04:51,029
of veggies and you know mucking the barn

2926
02:04:48,489 --> 02:04:55,420
and we sort of translated that into our

2927
02:04:51,029 --> 02:04:58,449
commercials small-scale cannabis growing

2928
02:04:55,420 --> 02:04:59,619
and growing from seed and that was the

2929
02:04:58,449 --> 02:05:02,079
other thing that they grow off too is

2930
02:04:59,619 --> 02:05:04,420
that we just grow from seed and that's

2931
02:05:02,079 --> 02:05:06,760
sort of part of our are how we aim for

2932
02:05:04,420 --> 02:05:08,890
diversity not just because we do also

2933
02:05:06,760 --> 02:05:21,310
grow food among our plants and I can't

2934
02:05:08,890 --> 02:05:24,579
you know canopy seed grow up Mendocino

2935
02:05:21,310 --> 02:05:28,300
County cannabis community is I mean

2936
02:05:24,579 --> 02:05:31,239
through legalization we've all come to

2937
02:05:28,300 --> 02:05:36,909
the forum and it's incredible how many

2938
02:05:31,239 --> 02:05:38,889
people we've met and just this past you

2939
02:05:36,909 --> 02:05:41,349
know since yeah we got to Mendocino

2940
02:05:38,890 --> 02:05:44,350
generations they are a group that has

2941
02:05:41,350 --> 02:05:45,940
come together and yes they have helped

2942
02:05:44,350 --> 02:05:47,530
us move a little bit of product here and

2943
02:05:45,939 --> 02:05:49,809
they're linking up with different

2944
02:05:47,529 --> 02:05:52,210
distributors like we're all sort of like

2945
02:05:49,810 --> 02:05:54,490
mycelium in a way and Craig - even

2946
02:05:52,210 --> 02:05:56,560
though he's not technically in you know

2947
02:05:54,489 --> 02:05:58,689
Mendocino generations but just sort of

2948
02:05:56,560 --> 02:06:01,030
like discussing with each other like

2949
02:05:58,689 --> 02:06:03,879
what's working like how do we you know

2950
02:06:01,029 --> 02:06:06,009
connect with this distributor putting

2951
02:06:03,880 --> 02:06:08,020
the pieces together like I like it like

2952
02:06:06,010 --> 02:06:11,170
a network has been really critical for

2953
02:06:08,020 --> 02:06:13,960
us to succeed and continue moving

2954
02:06:11,170 --> 02:06:15,789
forward and also so Mendocino

2955
02:06:13,960 --> 02:06:17,920
generations also has put on these

2956
02:06:15,789 --> 02:06:20,649
workshops where we could educate other

2957
02:06:17,920 --> 02:06:22,810
farmers in our group so that we can

2958
02:06:20,649 --> 02:06:24,219
influence them and show them that you

2959
02:06:22,810 --> 02:06:25,900
know we can also farm this way we can

2960
02:06:24,220 --> 02:06:29,500
cut our cost and grow really high

2961
02:06:25,899 --> 02:06:32,229
quality cannabis and that has been

2962
02:06:29,500 --> 02:06:34,180
really amazing and then the the den peer

2963
02:06:32,229 --> 02:06:35,889
certification again it has helped us

2964
02:06:34,180 --> 02:06:37,750
link up with other farmers too because

2965
02:06:35,890 --> 02:06:40,329
we go out to their farms and we check

2966
02:06:37,750 --> 02:06:42,340
them out and we just connect and and

2967
02:06:40,329 --> 02:06:45,130
that's our community so you know smoke a

2968
02:06:42,340 --> 02:06:47,239
doobie and I can see oh these these guys

2969
02:06:45,130 --> 02:06:49,099
are our tribe out here you know

2970
02:06:47,239 --> 02:06:50,868
are you know working that

2971
02:06:49,099 --> 02:06:52,489
it's really awesome and the pure

2972
02:06:50,868 --> 02:06:54,738
certification has been happening for a

2973
02:06:52,488 --> 02:06:57,408
while and so there's just a lot of

2974
02:06:54,738 --> 02:07:00,198
really strong connections being made I

2975
02:06:57,408 --> 02:07:03,049
love how for example tomara heal thyself

2976
02:07:00,198 --> 02:07:05,438
has had different farmers grow different

2977
02:07:03,050 --> 02:07:08,389
herbs so that she can make her her

2978
02:07:05,439 --> 02:07:10,039
herbal rolls that she makes and so many

2979
02:07:08,389 --> 02:07:11,779
others I mean there's coach Kirk in

2980
02:07:10,038 --> 02:07:14,238
Southern Oregon and really the you know

2981
02:07:11,779 --> 02:07:16,938
doing amazing work with hash and I would

2982
02:07:14,238 --> 02:07:20,448
love to maybe continue to have different

2983
02:07:16,939 --> 02:07:21,999
pure farms on on this to be able to tell

2984
02:07:20,448 --> 02:07:24,469
the different things that they're doing

2985
02:07:21,998 --> 02:07:26,929
you know to be able to move it all

2986
02:07:24,469 --> 02:07:29,179
forward there you go Craig's got some

2987
02:07:26,929 --> 02:07:33,019
good Craig now it's pretty beautiful is

2988
02:07:29,179 --> 02:07:37,519
that your coyote blue yes tanner tanner

2989
02:07:33,019 --> 02:07:39,168
what's going on brother I always feel

2990
02:07:37,519 --> 02:07:43,159
like wrestling now so we've got a

2991
02:07:39,168 --> 02:07:44,988
wrestle someone I was gonna I'm one of

2992
02:07:43,158 --> 02:07:46,308
the I wanted to make mention of one

2993
02:07:44,988 --> 02:07:48,648
thing that we were kind of talking about

2994
02:07:46,309 --> 02:07:52,909
and that was value kind of value of the

2995
02:07:48,649 --> 02:07:54,800
dumpier certification and one thing that

2996
02:07:52,908 --> 02:07:56,978
you guys pointed out as well you see a

2997
02:07:54,800 --> 02:08:00,859
lot of traffic through moon gazers and

2998
02:07:56,979 --> 02:08:04,699
our farm and lady sativa and and that's

2999
02:08:00,859 --> 02:08:08,149
for a reason what we've realized is this

3000
02:08:04,698 --> 02:08:13,029
new industry is built on investor money

3001
02:08:08,149 --> 02:08:17,059
and with that investment comes a

3002
02:08:13,029 --> 02:08:22,279
building of a deck so to speak to go get

3003
02:08:17,059 --> 02:08:27,859
money and and if if a person starting a

3004
02:08:22,279 --> 02:08:30,550
company needs to go find investment well

3005
02:08:27,859 --> 02:08:33,499
they need to show their supply line and

3006
02:08:30,550 --> 02:08:37,538
they need to show where that cannabis is

3007
02:08:33,498 --> 02:08:41,118
coming from and and who's growing it and

3008
02:08:37,538 --> 02:08:45,679
what we've realized is that this

3009
02:08:41,118 --> 02:08:48,168
industry we we started it from our sweat

3010
02:08:45,679 --> 02:08:51,439
and our hard work and built our farms

3011
02:08:48,168 --> 02:08:53,300
out by bootstrapping it and we've gotten

3012
02:08:51,439 --> 02:08:55,550
to the point a few years but few years

3013
02:08:53,300 --> 02:08:57,439
ago maybe two three years ago and then

3014
02:08:55,550 --> 02:09:00,859
then we saw the rush of investment

3015
02:08:57,439 --> 02:09:02,869
coming and then we realized okay this is

3016
02:09:00,859 --> 02:09:06,310
this is the path to go down

3017
02:09:02,869 --> 02:09:08,630
and then all of a sudden we realize that

3018
02:09:06,310 --> 02:09:12,650
more pictures need to be taken more

3019
02:09:08,630 --> 02:09:16,100
stories need to be told and and we we

3020
02:09:12,649 --> 02:09:21,769
realize that it's it's our life and our

3021
02:09:16,100 --> 02:09:25,970
farm that is creating that creating the

3022
02:09:21,770 --> 02:09:28,550
the security in this new market and and

3023
02:09:25,970 --> 02:09:30,770
how do we how do we hold on to our

3024
02:09:28,550 --> 02:09:34,760
values and how do we keep moving forward

3025
02:09:30,770 --> 02:09:37,010
through all that and and some of the

3026
02:09:34,760 --> 02:09:41,180
questions are being asked of us is you

3027
02:09:37,010 --> 02:09:44,900
know we're we're talking about value and

3028
02:09:41,180 --> 02:09:46,789
economics and wench when should a farmer

3029
02:09:44,899 --> 02:09:50,359
finally get paid for their efforts in

3030
02:09:46,789 --> 02:09:55,180
their work and and and what all that

3031
02:09:50,359 --> 02:09:58,519
means to keeping the farm going and and

3032
02:09:55,180 --> 02:10:03,700
I guess I guess what I'm trying to say

3033
02:09:58,520 --> 02:10:06,590
is the industry that we built had a new

3034
02:10:03,699 --> 02:10:10,340
realization and a lot of attention being

3035
02:10:06,590 --> 02:10:13,940
brought to it and and for a minute it

3036
02:10:10,340 --> 02:10:19,340
felt like we needed to turn over control

3037
02:10:13,939 --> 02:10:21,769
or turn over some of our future to these

3038
02:10:19,340 --> 02:10:24,770
other powers and that's totally not the

3039
02:10:21,770 --> 02:10:29,020
case they want to keep coming they want

3040
02:10:24,770 --> 02:10:31,520
to keep finding the value in us and and

3041
02:10:29,020 --> 02:10:33,290
we just need to figure out how to

3042
02:10:31,520 --> 02:10:36,800
organize like moon gazers are saying

3043
02:10:33,289 --> 02:10:39,920
with these coops we can't you know we

3044
02:10:36,800 --> 02:10:42,230
can't collude unless we have a co-op

3045
02:10:39,920 --> 02:10:45,470
because then we can talk about pricing

3046
02:10:42,229 --> 02:10:48,669
and then we can talk about things of

3047
02:10:45,470 --> 02:10:52,400
that nature legally so these coops are

3048
02:10:48,670 --> 02:10:56,690
100 percent important and our photos and

3049
02:10:52,399 --> 02:11:01,399
our farm images and our stories are our

3050
02:10:56,689 --> 02:11:05,239
value and by having it documented on the

3051
02:11:01,399 --> 02:11:07,399
DEM peer website as ours and our story

3052
02:11:05,239 --> 02:11:10,159
no one else can take that away because

3053
02:11:07,399 --> 02:11:13,250
we've shown that that is ours and we own

3054
02:11:10,159 --> 02:11:16,489
it even if it's on the internet so what

3055
02:11:13,250 --> 02:11:18,020
are they like them yeah yeah

3056
02:11:16,489 --> 02:11:21,199
commend everyone to go out there and and

3057
02:11:18,020 --> 02:11:23,330
tell your story to Instagram tell your

3058
02:11:21,199 --> 02:11:26,659
story on your website

3059
02:11:23,329 --> 02:11:29,750
write down your SOPs don't let people

3060
02:11:26,659 --> 02:11:32,239
take all your knowledge without having

3061
02:11:29,750 --> 02:11:34,939
solid agreements around it and it's it's

3062
02:11:32,239 --> 02:11:37,819
it's okay to share but how are you being

3063
02:11:34,939 --> 02:11:39,379
compensated for that sharing because

3064
02:11:37,819 --> 02:11:42,380
this is a life work of multiple

3065
02:11:39,380 --> 02:11:44,359
generations and to just hand it over you

3066
02:11:42,380 --> 02:11:47,960
know it we get caught up kind of in that

3067
02:11:44,359 --> 02:11:51,259
permaculture sharing is caring but

3068
02:11:47,960 --> 02:11:52,220
sharing is caring if we're it's not if

3069
02:11:51,260 --> 02:11:54,619
we're being exploited

3070
02:11:52,220 --> 02:11:58,670
Sherri's when you have when you can

3071
02:11:54,619 --> 02:12:01,279
still feed your family yeah I would like

3072
02:11:58,670 --> 02:12:03,319
to say that Julie from skunk magazine is

3073
02:12:01,279 --> 02:12:06,949
an amazing woman and she's really

3074
02:12:03,319 --> 02:12:09,139
putting her whole entire heart and soul

3075
02:12:06,949 --> 02:12:11,569
into exactly everything that you're

3076
02:12:09,140 --> 02:12:14,000
saying she's giving us a really big

3077
02:12:11,569 --> 02:12:17,229
opportunity to be able to have our voice

3078
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:20,300
heard not only here in Canada but in the

3079
02:12:17,229 --> 02:12:22,459
world wide and big shout out to skunk

3080
02:12:20,300 --> 02:12:23,840
magazine and Julie all changes that

3081
02:12:22,460 --> 02:12:25,640
they're gonna be making now they're

3082
02:12:23,840 --> 02:12:26,930
coming upon something called the Green

3083
02:12:25,640 --> 02:12:29,119
Renaissance and they're gonna be really

3084
02:12:26,930 --> 02:12:30,860
telling these stories that's what we're

3085
02:12:29,119 --> 02:12:33,140
talking about it's our Green Renaissance

3086
02:12:30,859 --> 02:12:36,439
and I wanted to bring it back over to

3087
02:12:33,140 --> 02:12:39,950
Ross kya you know your your business we

3088
02:12:36,439 --> 02:12:42,109
see your your beautiful brand out there

3089
02:12:39,949 --> 02:12:44,359
I know that you've really put yourself

3090
02:12:42,109 --> 02:12:46,549
forward you guys must be working day and

3091
02:12:44,359 --> 02:12:49,009
night to really get your business out

3092
02:12:46,550 --> 02:12:51,710
there and it does seem to be an

3093
02:12:49,010 --> 02:12:54,010
incredible work of love and and what is

3094
02:12:51,710 --> 02:12:56,840
it that you found that has been

3095
02:12:54,010 --> 02:12:58,460
successful in doing that in bringing

3096
02:12:56,840 --> 02:13:01,039
your your business and you talked about

3097
02:12:58,460 --> 02:13:03,500
the air through one two three waves

3098
02:13:01,039 --> 02:13:04,340
right now and everything so maybe you

3099
02:13:03,500 --> 02:13:08,750
can yeah

3100
02:13:04,340 --> 02:13:12,140
add some thoughts too you know I didn't

3101
02:13:08,750 --> 02:13:15,500
really want to talk about it today but

3102
02:13:12,140 --> 02:13:17,720
it seems like I just kind of should put

3103
02:13:15,500 --> 02:13:19,239
in 18 months of work Craig Craig has

3104
02:13:17,720 --> 02:13:23,270
brought up some some really really

3105
02:13:19,239 --> 02:13:25,939
massively important points I just put in

3106
02:13:23,270 --> 02:13:27,540
18 months of work developing a really

3107
02:13:25,939 --> 02:13:32,419
great facility

3108
02:13:27,539 --> 02:13:35,760
and developing IP bringing my IP in

3109
02:13:32,420 --> 02:13:38,310
business models for this hash thing I

3110
02:13:35,760 --> 02:13:40,020
thought I had good contracts maybe I do

3111
02:13:38,310 --> 02:13:42,780
maybe I don't

3112
02:13:40,020 --> 02:13:45,200
I can't get into it a lot but it's super

3113
02:13:42,779 --> 02:13:49,349
important that you protect yourself and

3114
02:13:45,199 --> 02:13:53,519
I just I can't tell you like right now

3115
02:13:49,350 --> 02:13:55,079
that really is resonating with me and I

3116
02:13:53,520 --> 02:13:57,420
do have this heart that wants to share

3117
02:13:55,079 --> 02:13:59,760
and you know especially in the hash

3118
02:13:57,420 --> 02:14:02,640
world I felt like when there's

3119
02:13:59,760 --> 02:14:04,230
competition with the growing the hash

3120
02:14:02,640 --> 02:14:06,780
guys worried still sharing their

3121
02:14:04,229 --> 02:14:09,929
knowledge of how to make better hash I'm

3122
02:14:06,779 --> 02:14:11,369
really pushing that forward but I think

3123
02:14:09,930 --> 02:14:12,930
we're at a time where you you really

3124
02:14:11,369 --> 02:14:15,720
kind of have to protect that a bit too

3125
02:14:12,930 --> 02:14:17,090
because once companies have that that

3126
02:14:15,720 --> 02:14:20,430
then maybe they don't need you anymore

3127
02:14:17,090 --> 02:14:23,730
and that puts you in a really really

3128
02:14:20,430 --> 02:14:25,369
tough situation sometimes so for me I'm

3129
02:14:23,729 --> 02:14:27,689
kind of going through some of that and

3130
02:14:25,369 --> 02:14:29,849
at the same time it's a blessing because

3131
02:14:27,689 --> 02:14:32,879
now I'm I'm able to kind of turn my

3132
02:14:29,850 --> 02:14:36,090
focus back to you know our little song

3133
02:14:32,880 --> 02:14:37,650
here show you out the window out there

3134
02:14:36,090 --> 02:14:42,360
we've got you know where we're growing

3135
02:14:37,649 --> 02:14:45,569
our food and my beautiful wife Tati she

3136
02:14:42,359 --> 02:14:48,779
did some great CBD readings this year so

3137
02:14:45,569 --> 02:14:52,500
in the face of kind of this the success

3138
02:14:48,779 --> 02:14:55,349
but also a failure because I may not get

3139
02:14:52,500 --> 02:14:57,420
to see it through I have this this other

3140
02:14:55,350 --> 02:15:00,900
side that I never left and that is going

3141
02:14:57,420 --> 02:15:02,789
to be there for me and so you know don't

3142
02:15:00,899 --> 02:15:04,529
don't lose don't sell out for that you

3143
02:15:02,789 --> 02:15:06,600
know there was a huge pressure I felt

3144
02:15:04,529 --> 02:15:10,349
you know personally a huge pressure to

3145
02:15:06,600 --> 02:15:13,740
catch up you know get get invest to get

3146
02:15:10,350 --> 02:15:15,360
into one of these markets and the truth

3147
02:15:13,739 --> 02:15:17,010
is it's it's getting better every day

3148
02:15:15,359 --> 02:15:19,589
there's no rush no need to put yourself

3149
02:15:17,010 --> 02:15:21,720
forward in a situation where you're not

3150
02:15:19,590 --> 02:15:24,900
completely covered because it is going

3151
02:15:21,720 --> 02:15:28,949
to get better for us and people are

3152
02:15:24,899 --> 02:15:31,349
valuing you know the methods that that

3153
02:15:28,949 --> 02:15:35,189
that we're using to grow herb and to

3154
02:15:31,350 --> 02:15:37,230
make make concentrates and you know

3155
02:15:35,189 --> 02:15:40,169
don't don't get caught up in that in

3156
02:15:37,229 --> 02:15:41,519
that rush to you know get legitimized or

3157
02:15:40,170 --> 02:15:43,440
whatever it is

3158
02:15:41,520 --> 02:15:45,000
you know take your time with it and make

3159
02:15:43,439 --> 02:15:46,829
sure that you're talking to other people

3160
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:48,180
and making those connections and that

3161
02:15:46,829 --> 02:15:51,899
you're all looking out for each other

3162
02:15:48,180 --> 02:15:54,690
along that journey so yeah that's that's

3163
02:15:51,899 --> 02:15:56,489
that's well well taken and we understand

3164
02:15:54,689 --> 02:15:58,439
you know I mean it's it's part of the

3165
02:15:56,489 --> 02:16:00,210
network that we're creating is you know

3166
02:15:58,439 --> 02:16:02,069
being able to support each other in and

3167
02:16:00,210 --> 02:16:05,730
some of the successes and some of the

3168
02:16:02,069 --> 02:16:08,189
hardships you know it's it's it's one

3169
02:16:05,729 --> 02:16:10,349
thing that that you have is that you can

3170
02:16:08,189 --> 02:16:12,149
never take away as your experience and

3171
02:16:10,350 --> 02:16:14,160
being able to know that you can do

3172
02:16:12,149 --> 02:16:15,659
something so that's that's something

3173
02:16:14,159 --> 02:16:17,369
you'll always have and that's really

3174
02:16:15,659 --> 02:16:20,760
important and I think just being able to

3175
02:16:17,369 --> 02:16:23,220
stay you know adaptogenic you know is a

3176
02:16:20,760 --> 02:16:24,480
really important quality and you know

3177
02:16:23,220 --> 02:16:26,460
we're gonna have to go through some

3178
02:16:24,479 --> 02:16:29,669
different things I know Marcus is even

3179
02:16:26,460 --> 02:16:31,710
you know putting a lot into his future

3180
02:16:29,670 --> 02:16:34,110
and that future is still you know

3181
02:16:31,710 --> 02:16:36,750
unfolding at this moment and everything

3182
02:16:34,110 --> 02:16:40,019
so it's you know I think being able to

3183
02:16:36,750 --> 02:16:42,929
have you know not out deer so if not run

3184
02:16:40,019 --> 02:16:44,880
too too far and into the hot wing one of

3185
02:16:42,929 --> 02:16:46,558
the things we've we joke around and say

3186
02:16:44,879 --> 02:16:48,959
is that don't believe the hype believe

3187
02:16:46,558 --> 02:16:51,750
the hyphae you know like maybe we just

3188
02:16:48,959 --> 02:16:53,968
got to keep it in the - you know and the

3189
02:16:51,750 --> 02:16:56,849
family like look how beautiful this is

3190
02:16:53,968 --> 02:16:58,619
you know and that's another thing about

3191
02:16:56,849 --> 02:17:00,989
the farming you know we've tried to

3192
02:16:58,620 --> 02:17:04,010
diversify the cannabis farms you know to

3193
02:17:00,989 --> 02:17:06,599
say hey what about some you know other

3194
02:17:04,010 --> 02:17:09,210
added products on the farm you know what

3195
02:17:06,599 --> 02:17:10,440
else can we grow that is also really you

3196
02:17:09,209 --> 02:17:12,149
know maybe we're all the sudden we're

3197
02:17:10,440 --> 02:17:13,800
all growing ginseng you know who knows

3198
02:17:12,149 --> 02:17:16,529
what it is and even in the herbal market

3199
02:17:13,799 --> 02:17:18,299
there's there's there's herbal farmers

3200
02:17:16,530 --> 02:17:19,800
out there with echinacea and different

3201
02:17:18,299 --> 02:17:21,929
things and they're even their markets

3202
02:17:19,799 --> 02:17:24,989
have dropped out you know and can in the

3203
02:17:21,929 --> 02:17:28,500
in the course of things so um we're just

3204
02:17:24,989 --> 02:17:30,090
probably going to continue to move

3205
02:17:28,500 --> 02:17:32,638
forward with the idea that everything's

3206
02:17:30,090 --> 02:17:35,489
gonna work out because we have this like

3207
02:17:32,638 --> 02:17:37,409
love bomb that just like can't be put

3208
02:17:35,489 --> 02:17:39,599
out you know and we're starting to work

3209
02:17:37,409 --> 02:17:42,539
and I think Marcus you might know Martin

3210
02:17:39,599 --> 02:17:45,329
over in Belfast and Ireland we're

3211
02:17:42,540 --> 02:17:48,150
starting to work with the hemp kitchen

3212
02:17:45,329 --> 02:17:48,929
and some really awesome families over in

3213
02:17:48,149 --> 02:17:54,209
Ireland

3214
02:17:48,929 --> 02:17:59,519
Martin Gillis yes big up to Martin and

3215
02:17:54,209 --> 02:18:01,529
I know Martin I think those guys are

3216
02:17:59,519 --> 02:18:03,780
working really hard in Ireland to become

3217
02:18:01,530 --> 02:18:05,400
legalized and to bring hemp forward and

3218
02:18:03,780 --> 02:18:07,710
they're doing it in a real community way

3219
02:18:05,399 --> 02:18:10,409
they're joining together and you know

3220
02:18:07,709 --> 02:18:15,750
they're stepping Marcus your mic is on

3221
02:18:10,409 --> 02:18:18,299
there so we're yeah that's super

3222
02:18:15,750 --> 02:18:20,280
exciting and I feel like you know so

3223
02:18:18,299 --> 02:18:22,018
many of us felt that pressure that

3224
02:18:20,280 --> 02:18:23,639
you're talking about ky you know we're

3225
02:18:22,019 --> 02:18:25,978
feeling that pressure right now when we

3226
02:18:23,638 --> 02:18:29,569
get a number from Health Canada saying

3227
02:18:25,978 --> 02:18:33,689
that they're only gonna okay and value

3228
02:18:29,569 --> 02:18:37,110
671 applications that may feel like oh

3229
02:18:33,690 --> 02:18:39,120
[ __ ] we gotta be what do we got to do we

3230
02:18:37,110 --> 02:18:41,010
got it we got a hurry up and we got to

3231
02:18:39,120 --> 02:18:43,410
get investors and we got a rush to the

3232
02:18:41,010 --> 02:18:45,210
bottom and I just feel like we don't

3233
02:18:43,409 --> 02:18:48,899
need to be rushing to the bottom just

3234
02:18:45,209 --> 02:18:51,739
the slow and steady and like John said

3235
02:18:48,899 --> 02:18:53,789
no understanding that we have a

3236
02:18:51,739 --> 02:18:56,010
relationship with this planet we have a

3237
02:18:53,790 --> 02:18:58,860
relationship with the community we have

3238
02:18:56,010 --> 02:19:01,019
a relationship with our own feelings and

3239
02:18:58,860 --> 02:19:02,909
our own happiness and we value that as

3240
02:19:01,019 --> 02:19:06,090
well and we want to put that in the

3241
02:19:02,909 --> 02:19:08,549
forefront of all of this no matter what

3242
02:19:06,090 --> 02:19:10,530
happens in moving forward and so you

3243
02:19:08,549 --> 02:19:11,819
know we're hearing from Martin we just

3244
02:19:10,530 --> 02:19:14,670
had a long conversation with him

3245
02:19:11,819 --> 02:19:17,728
yesterday how eager you know let's say

3246
02:19:14,670 --> 02:19:22,260
Irish families and Scottish and and the

3247
02:19:17,728 --> 02:19:24,090
UK and beyond but right now I need

3248
02:19:22,260 --> 02:19:25,530
nothing more than the opportunity to

3249
02:19:24,090 --> 02:19:26,760
have some of the issues that we're

3250
02:19:25,530 --> 02:19:30,329
having which would be getting a lot of

3251
02:19:26,760 --> 02:19:32,550
medicine at their communities on their

3252
02:19:30,329 --> 02:19:35,159
high stuff to just empower each other on

3253
02:19:32,549 --> 02:19:36,268
a down the dl to really make everything

3254
02:19:35,159 --> 02:19:39,599
work

3255
02:19:36,269 --> 02:19:41,760
I just wanted part of the reasons them

3256
02:19:39,599 --> 02:19:44,880
in this panel together was to try and

3257
02:19:41,760 --> 02:19:46,710
get us to all do our best to try and

3258
02:19:44,879 --> 02:19:49,049
stay in there and maybe it's moving

3259
02:19:46,709 --> 02:19:51,389
slowly maybe it's not taking on you know

3260
02:19:49,049 --> 02:19:54,029
huge investment but to put to try and

3261
02:19:51,389 --> 02:19:55,289
stay in there and and and and what we

3262
02:19:54,030 --> 02:19:57,150
heard from Wade and then what's

3263
02:19:55,290 --> 02:19:58,680
happening with the clad just clad rias

3264
02:19:57,149 --> 02:20:00,989
network and probably a lot of people

3265
02:19:58,680 --> 02:20:01,880
here in Canada you know in losing a lot

3266
02:20:00,989 --> 02:20:05,219
of their acts

3267
02:20:01,879 --> 02:20:07,679
let's just say I hope it's a short time

3268
02:20:05,219 --> 02:20:11,549
and let's do all we can to you know

3269
02:20:07,680 --> 02:20:14,069
continue that that medicine and I wanted

3270
02:20:11,549 --> 02:20:16,259
to ask you Sam as well you know you've

3271
02:20:14,069 --> 02:20:18,479
been in and out of so many different

3272
02:20:16,260 --> 02:20:20,550
types of industries and the ups and the

3273
02:20:18,479 --> 02:20:22,079
downs and the International whether it's

3274
02:20:20,549 --> 02:20:25,379
in Europe or whether it's in California

3275
02:20:22,079 --> 02:20:28,021
or on and on and people have probably

3276
02:20:25,379 --> 02:20:30,329
you know gone down the toilet and then

3277
02:20:28,021 --> 02:20:33,239
other people have risen to the top are

3278
02:20:30,329 --> 02:20:36,299
you seeing that there's there's sort of

3279
02:20:33,239 --> 02:20:38,459
a straight line on what can define how

3280
02:20:36,299 --> 02:20:41,639
people are becoming successful in this

3281
02:20:38,459 --> 02:20:46,709
industry and moving forward to be honest

3282
02:20:41,639 --> 02:20:49,649
I expected what marijuana became fully

3283
02:20:46,709 --> 02:20:54,389
legal and taxed and regulated which I

3284
02:20:49,649 --> 02:20:57,329
[ __ ] for most of my life I expected

3285
02:20:54,389 --> 02:21:01,709
bankers and lawyers to end up with most

3286
02:20:57,329 --> 02:21:05,100
of it pretty quick I mean look what big

3287
02:21:01,709 --> 02:21:07,649
business aren't fate controlling the

3288
02:21:05,100 --> 02:21:10,680
bankers and the lawyers but let's be

3289
02:21:07,649 --> 02:21:13,649
frankly August there is no big

3290
02:21:10,680 --> 02:21:16,680
international multinational corporate

3291
02:21:13,649 --> 02:21:20,940
business that is not controlled by banks

3292
02:21:16,680 --> 02:21:24,180
and lawyers but way it works so that

3293
02:21:20,940 --> 02:21:26,430
doesn't bother me I mean I I buy

3294
02:21:24,180 --> 02:21:28,920
international brands of things that I

3295
02:21:26,430 --> 02:21:33,479
like whether it took pair of Levi's

3296
02:21:28,920 --> 02:21:38,460
pants or whatever and you know I buy a

3297
02:21:33,479 --> 02:21:42,239
car you know so yeah it doesn't really

3298
02:21:38,459 --> 02:21:46,889
bother me I I just want the home grower

3299
02:21:42,239 --> 02:21:50,420
to be able to grow it himself and I also

3300
02:21:46,889 --> 02:21:53,819
think any small drawer that's willing to

3301
02:21:50,420 --> 02:21:56,521
pass at least a minimum of regulation to

3302
02:21:53,819 --> 02:21:59,369
make sure it's safe and effective you

3303
02:21:56,521 --> 02:22:04,380
know men should be loved to produce it

3304
02:21:59,370 --> 02:22:06,630
for anybody lots of and maybe there's

3305
02:22:04,379 --> 02:22:09,779
three more in that direction even if

3306
02:22:06,629 --> 02:22:13,909
it's two step forward one step back

3307
02:22:09,780 --> 02:22:13,909
2/5 forward one step back

3308
02:22:16,068 --> 02:22:23,689
we've been fighting this fight a long

3309
02:22:18,600 --> 02:22:26,460
time and it's not anywhere near over and

3310
02:22:23,689 --> 02:22:28,920
one of the things I keep reminding

3311
02:22:26,459 --> 02:22:31,500
myself of it's really about the plant

3312
02:22:28,920 --> 02:22:34,500
and our relationship to it

3313
02:22:31,500 --> 02:22:36,658
and what you say it's them about

3314
02:22:34,500 --> 02:22:39,469
everyone being able to grow their own I

3315
02:22:36,658 --> 02:22:44,029
think it's too late to put out that fire

3316
02:22:39,469 --> 02:22:46,079
for all of the lawyers and the bankers

3317
02:22:44,029 --> 02:22:48,029
people are going to be able to grow

3318
02:22:46,079 --> 02:22:50,430
their own how it's going to look or how

3319
02:22:48,029 --> 02:22:53,609
its how long that's going to take who

3320
02:22:50,430 --> 02:22:56,040
knows and I'm sure it'll vary country to

3321
02:22:53,609 --> 02:22:57,899
country as Marcus made reference to

3322
02:22:56,040 --> 02:23:01,260
earlier Malaysia's considering not

3323
02:22:57,898 --> 02:23:05,670
hanging the guy who's been providing

3324
02:23:01,260 --> 02:23:07,738
medicine to people in Malaysia but the

3325
02:23:05,670 --> 02:23:12,329
firmament says they're going to change

3326
02:23:07,738 --> 02:23:14,158
of the law and save his boat well yeah I

3327
02:23:12,329 --> 02:23:16,889
was just talking about how different

3328
02:23:14,158 --> 02:23:21,270
jurisdictions have are making different

3329
02:23:16,889 --> 02:23:24,809
rates of progress and it's kind of sad

3330
02:23:21,270 --> 02:23:28,050
that the places that are trying to

3331
02:23:24,809 --> 02:23:34,260
regulate it and make it available for

3332
02:23:28,049 --> 02:23:36,448
adult use or medical use are doing so

3333
02:23:34,260 --> 02:23:39,090
poorly at it we could say it like that

3334
02:23:36,449 --> 02:23:41,250
but it's really about the plant and it's

3335
02:23:39,090 --> 02:23:45,180
about our relationship to the plant and

3336
02:23:41,250 --> 02:23:48,859
what this plant can do for us if we if

3337
02:23:45,180 --> 02:23:52,380
we keep that in mind

3338
02:23:48,859 --> 02:23:55,829
personally as well as socially all

3339
02:23:52,379 --> 02:23:57,929
across the planet literally as the rust

3340
02:23:55,829 --> 02:24:04,670
is used to say it's the healing of the

3341
02:23:57,930 --> 02:24:10,050
people it's still saying they still know

3342
02:24:04,670 --> 02:24:11,850
and that is you know we're we're we're a

3343
02:24:10,049 --> 02:24:14,698
bunch of farmers and cultivators and

3344
02:24:11,850 --> 02:24:16,738
hash makers here and and we're business

3345
02:24:14,699 --> 02:24:18,899
people and our own right but we keep

3346
02:24:16,738 --> 02:24:21,329
talking about the the bankers and the

3347
02:24:18,898 --> 02:24:22,889
lawyers and there's I know there's a

3348
02:24:21,329 --> 02:24:24,809
handful of bankers and lawyers out there

3349
02:24:22,889 --> 02:24:28,170
that really really appreciate our

3350
02:24:24,809 --> 02:24:28,470
dumpier sun-grown so we are going to

3351
02:24:28,170 --> 02:24:30,060
need some

3352
02:24:28,470 --> 02:24:33,001
help and we're gonna need some of these

3353
02:24:30,060 --> 02:24:34,950
strategic relationships to help us do

3354
02:24:33,001 --> 02:24:37,951
what we need to do so we're not sitting

3355
02:24:34,950 --> 02:24:39,840
here shaking our heads so we have good

3356
02:24:37,950 --> 02:24:43,260
information not only in our growing and

3357
02:24:39,841 --> 02:24:45,690
our cultivation and our inputs but our

3358
02:24:43,261 --> 02:24:50,341
outputs and how our outputs what are

3359
02:24:45,690 --> 02:24:52,621
their SOPs strains you know all these

3360
02:24:50,341 --> 02:24:56,479
things we're gonna need some more help

3361
02:24:52,620 --> 02:24:59,010
and I just want to put that out there

3362
02:24:56,479 --> 02:25:03,450
it's big difference between them

3363
02:24:59,011 --> 02:25:06,239
healthiness and them basically taking

3364
02:25:03,450 --> 02:25:09,149
over from us because corporations

3365
02:25:06,239 --> 02:25:13,739
especially international multinationals

3366
02:25:09,149 --> 02:25:16,171
are there sharks I mean that's probably

3367
02:25:13,739 --> 02:25:18,810
the way most of them are there's

3368
02:25:16,171 --> 02:25:21,780
exceptions I mean I don't a couple of

3369
02:25:18,810 --> 02:25:25,649
corporations I was never Sharky at all

3370
02:25:21,780 --> 02:25:28,081
but you know I mean it wasn't a big

3371
02:25:25,649 --> 02:25:31,560
giant corporation with thousands of

3372
02:25:28,081 --> 02:25:33,390
employees just just to throw it out

3373
02:25:31,560 --> 02:25:35,190
there Washington State I think it's more

3374
02:25:33,390 --> 02:25:39,359
than 50% of all the retail stores are

3375
02:25:35,190 --> 02:25:40,831
owned by lawyers no one thought I was

3376
02:25:39,360 --> 02:25:43,291

3377
02:25:40,831 --> 02:25:45,331
toss into Washington State you know cuz

3378
02:25:43,290 --> 02:25:49,380

much for that bro and thanks for just

3386
02:26:00,931 --> 02:26:07,140
being vulnerable but um we lost 45

3387
02:26:04,681 --> 02:26:11,819
percent of our producer processors this

3388
02:26:07,140 --> 02:26:15,270
summer and it's that's crazy you guys 45

3389
02:26:11,819 --> 02:26:17,880
percent of people and the thing that is

3390
02:26:15,271 --> 02:26:21,061
weird in Washington is we are a market

3391
02:26:17,880 --> 02:26:23,700
mostly of I say contractors and real

3392
02:26:21,060 --> 02:26:25,200
estate agents a lot of those people

3393
02:26:23,700 --> 02:26:28,529
through in their retirements and started

3394
02:26:25,200 --> 02:26:30,090
this business in 2014 and they lost it

3395
02:26:28,530 --> 02:26:32,521
all and they're real people they may not

3396
02:26:30,091 --> 02:26:34,381
have been cannabis people for the last

3397
02:26:32,521 --> 02:26:38,400
twenty five years but they you know are

3398
02:26:34,380 --> 02:26:39,600
real people and yeah we're just what I

3399
02:26:38,399 --> 02:26:41,501
just said I'm just trying to say we're

3400
02:26:39,601 --> 02:26:43,690
going through that shift and in

3401
02:26:41,501 --> 02:26:45,190
I really just echo that message the Josh

3402
02:26:43,690 --> 02:26:47,681
and Kelly were saying they said it last

3403
02:26:45,190 --> 02:26:49,451
January like hold tight you know start

3404
02:26:47,681 --> 02:26:52,301
growing veggies start doing whatever you

3405
02:26:49,450 --> 02:26:55,090
can do to to hold on your business and

3406
02:26:52,300 --> 02:26:57,310
I'm Dom doing that I'm holding on you

3407
02:26:55,091 --> 02:26:59,171
know just by the threads and I'm I'm

3408
02:26:57,310 --> 02:27:01,450
just a soul guy like I'm starting hash

3409
02:26:59,171 --> 02:27:03,729
tagging it now like I'm a farmer of one

3410
02:27:01,450 --> 02:27:05,200
like I'm gonna grow what I can grow and

3411
02:27:03,729 --> 02:27:09,011
sell what I can grow and take care of my

3412
02:27:05,200 --> 02:27:12,390
family and I don't know that's tagged by

3413
02:27:09,011 --> 02:27:15,791
a thread yeah

3414
02:27:12,390 --> 02:27:19,060
how about helping a new bill the just

3415
02:27:15,790 --> 02:27:21,970
let us [ __ ] have it bill I would vote

3416
02:27:19,060 --> 02:27:24,399
for that bill just let us [ __ ] have

3417
02:27:21,970 --> 02:27:26,171
it and I think that also you know

3418
02:27:24,399 --> 02:27:28,149
addressing what you were saying Sam is

3419
02:27:26,171 --> 02:27:29,739
yeah I do think that you know it's

3420
02:27:28,149 --> 02:27:32,171
inevitable these huge big large

3421
02:27:29,739 --> 02:27:34,300
corporations that are stepping in there

3422
02:27:32,171 --> 02:27:36,149
are big huge large corporations at least

3423
02:27:34,300 --> 02:27:38,979
here in Canada that really don't have

3424
02:27:36,149 --> 02:27:40,899
real knowledge on how to actually grow

3425
02:27:38,979 --> 02:27:42,189
the commodity that it is that they're

3426
02:27:40,899 --> 02:27:45,279
selling which is a really interesting

3427
02:27:42,190 --> 02:27:48,221
thing to me but the thing that I feel

3428
02:27:45,280 --> 02:27:49,780
most concerned about is the exploitation

3429
02:27:48,220 --> 02:27:53,439
of the land in Canada

3430
02:27:49,780 --> 02:27:56,141
I'm extremely I'm extremely worried and

3431
02:27:53,440 --> 02:27:58,511
concerned about the massive amounts of

3432
02:27:56,140 --> 02:28:01,779
flushing of all of these different n P

3433
02:27:58,511 --> 02:28:03,671
K's and people not really realizing that

3434
02:28:01,780 --> 02:28:06,041
they really don't have to use but like

3435
02:28:03,671 --> 02:28:08,229
1/10 of what they're using and I feel

3436
02:28:06,040 --> 02:28:11,050
like if we could bridge the gap with

3437
02:28:08,229 --> 02:28:13,899
these large corporations then we could

3438
02:28:11,050 --> 02:28:16,841
have a viable industry and a corporation

3439
02:28:13,899 --> 02:28:18,729
that was healthy for Canada and moving

3440
02:28:16,841 --> 02:28:21,131
forward in the cannabis industry as well

3441
02:28:18,729 --> 02:28:24,279
so this is a really big concern of mine

3442
02:28:21,130 --> 02:28:28,870
with the corporations and and what it is

3443
02:28:24,280 --> 02:28:31,061
that they're doing I think that but

3444
02:28:28,870 --> 02:28:34,359
that's a heavy albatross to put around

3445
02:28:31,060 --> 02:28:36,810
cannabis neck I mean let's face it most

3446
02:28:34,360 --> 02:28:39,761
cannabis will not be grown

3447
02:28:36,810 --> 02:28:43,989
biodynamically organically in the future

3448
02:28:39,761 --> 02:28:46,301
I wish it was but I like it it's much

3449
02:28:43,989 --> 02:28:50,411
spirit the way I've grown for 50 years

3450
02:28:46,300 --> 02:28:54,069
but that said how much of our food in

3451
02:28:50,411 --> 02:28:55,590
Canada or America is grown organically

3452
02:28:54,069 --> 02:28:58,719
by own

3453
02:28:55,590 --> 02:29:00,340
you know that just solidifies the fact

3454
02:28:58,719 --> 02:29:01,989
that everything that we're doing is

3455
02:29:00,340 --> 02:29:04,569
always gonna have a place in the world

3456
02:29:01,989 --> 02:29:08,619
because every single time we go out into

3457
02:29:04,569 --> 02:29:11,920
the public and we put out 24 jars of our

3458
02:29:08,620 --> 02:29:14,229
ganja on the counter everyone wants it I

3459
02:29:11,920 --> 02:29:16,930
mean we just did it two weeks ago we're

3460
02:29:14,228 --> 02:29:18,849
in Vancouver at an amazing event on the

3461
02:29:16,930 --> 02:29:22,870
kitchens I'm saying this the more

3462
02:29:18,850 --> 02:29:24,489
schlotz are out there the more ya need

3463
02:29:22,870 --> 02:29:26,260
you are you on the slocks

3464
02:29:24,489 --> 02:29:27,909
I mean it's not good for it's not good

3465
02:29:26,260 --> 02:29:30,909
it's not good for the earth so we're

3466
02:29:27,909 --> 02:29:33,489
gonna continue with healthy access to

3467
02:29:30,909 --> 02:29:36,039
humans and healthy access to the earth

3468
02:29:33,489 --> 02:29:38,829
because I'm always trying to leave the

3469
02:29:36,040 --> 02:29:41,820
soil healthier and a better condition

3470
02:29:38,829 --> 02:29:44,590
than when I started with it and that's

3471
02:29:41,819 --> 02:29:46,840
regenerative we appreciate that you know

3472
02:29:44,590 --> 02:29:49,510
about your work and and and any way that

3473
02:29:46,840 --> 02:29:51,130
we can continue really - we can talk to

3474
02:29:49,510 --> 02:29:52,750
each other about farmers that's really

3475
02:29:51,129 --> 02:29:54,879
important but we have to continue to get

3476
02:29:52,750 --> 02:29:56,469
the message out to the to the people

3477
02:29:54,879 --> 02:29:58,929
that need the medicine so when the

3478
02:29:56,469 --> 02:30:01,688
people that are buying the medicine know

3479
02:29:58,930 --> 02:30:04,689
the difference between a flood and

3480
02:30:01,689 --> 02:30:06,909
drained 3 million square foot greenhouse

3481
02:30:04,689 --> 02:30:16,720
using chemicals when they if they have

3482
02:30:06,909 --> 02:30:19,750
an oxygen and from our farm to get other

3483
02:30:16,719 --> 02:30:23,938
earth from a 3 million square foot area

3484
02:30:19,750 --> 02:30:28,000
and then in plunge drain every hour I

3485
02:30:23,939 --> 02:30:29,590
had pretty easy donation so we have

3486
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:31,600
everything what we have is into

3487
02:30:29,590 --> 02:30:33,489
education for that like you said and

3488
02:30:31,600 --> 02:30:35,170
like you said it is going against the

3489
02:30:33,489 --> 02:30:37,659
beast I mean you didn't say that per se

3490
02:30:35,170 --> 02:30:39,909
but it really is going against the large

3491
02:30:37,659 --> 02:30:41,590
beast and I think that I know that Josh

3492
02:30:39,909 --> 02:30:44,500
and I are gonna take our last dying

3493
02:30:41,590 --> 02:30:47,530
breath fighting for this plant fighting

3494
02:30:44,500 --> 02:30:50,049
for access healthy access not just

3495
02:30:47,530 --> 02:30:53,050
access to patients that healthy access

3496
02:30:50,049 --> 02:30:55,029
to patients and healthy environment in

3497
02:30:53,049 --> 02:30:57,938
which to grow in and I feel like it's

3498
02:30:55,030 --> 02:31:00,070
it's a worthy thing to fight for it and

3499
02:30:57,939 --> 02:31:02,439
it's another fight as midwifery we won't

3500
02:31:00,069 --> 02:31:04,600
get into it but home birth and and and

3501
02:31:02,439 --> 02:31:06,399
breastfeeding and and that's a human

3502
02:31:04,600 --> 02:31:08,431
right that's being attacked you know

3503
02:31:06,399 --> 02:31:10,739
across the world - so we

3504
02:31:08,431 --> 02:31:14,940
don't see a difference really in the

3505
02:31:10,739 --> 02:31:17,729
fight really were just earth warriors

3506
02:31:14,940 --> 02:31:19,921
that really our last breath is going to

3507
02:31:17,729 --> 02:31:21,930
be you know save the plants save the

3508
02:31:19,921 --> 02:31:27,331
humans do something for the soil you

3509
02:31:21,931 --> 02:31:30,931

incredible experience for you all kya

3526
02:32:20,130 --> 02:32:25,199

the community you know what what are

3537
02:32:51,181 --> 02:32:54,780
some of the things that you're doing in

3538
02:32:53,190 --> 02:32:56,700
your community that maybe you could tell

3539
02:32:54,780 --> 02:32:58,711
us about or something about your farm

3540
02:32:56,700 --> 02:33:01,771
that's really awesome this year that

3541
02:32:58,710 --> 02:33:04,739
you're really stoked about oh thanks for

3542
02:33:01,771 --> 02:33:06,900
having me back yeah we did a couple

3543
02:33:04,739 --> 02:33:10,140
years ago we did a values conference so

3544
02:33:06,899 --> 02:33:12,421
we invited 60 Plus people to the

3545
02:33:10,140 --> 02:33:15,690
material community center and we did a

3546
02:33:12,421 --> 02:33:19,739
whole process facilitated process on how

3547
02:33:15,690 --> 02:33:21,390
what are the values that are intrinsic

3548
02:33:19,739 --> 02:33:22,709
to the back to the land movement and

3549
02:33:21,390 --> 02:33:26,609
they were beautiful

3550
02:33:22,709 --> 02:33:31,409
we narrowed them down and we we came up

3551
02:33:26,610 --> 02:33:34,729
with nine values that that some of them

3552
02:33:31,409 --> 02:33:38,510
were like the earth is sacred and

3553
02:33:34,728 --> 02:33:42,929
sustains us and we have to honor that by

3554
02:33:38,510 --> 02:33:45,420
not polluting and being sacred living in

3555
02:33:42,930 --> 02:33:49,530
it in a way that that is sacred to the

3556
02:33:45,420 --> 02:33:51,450
earth one was where a refugee area from

3557
02:33:49,530 --> 02:33:53,970
people for people that want to escape

3558
02:33:51,450 --> 02:33:56,760
the dominant paradigm and we need to

3559
02:33:53,969 --> 02:33:58,859
stay open to new people that come into

3560
02:33:56,760 --> 02:34:03,750
our community and and and figure out

3561
02:33:58,860 --> 02:34:06,930
ways to incorporate them one is that our

3562
02:34:03,750 --> 02:34:08,969
health care system is integral to our

3563
02:34:06,930 --> 02:34:11,569
lifestyle that it's not just a

3564
02:34:08,969 --> 02:34:16,349
prescriptive health care system it's a

3565
02:34:11,569 --> 02:34:18,899
it's a it's a life of health preventive

3566
02:34:16,350 --> 02:34:24,360
health so they were we just went through

3567
02:34:18,899 --> 02:34:26,879
and and and I think that they'll live

3568
02:34:24,360 --> 02:34:29,069
that we we wrote him out and we're gonna

3569
02:34:26,879 --> 02:34:33,959
use them in our economic development

3570
02:34:29,069 --> 02:34:36,949
plans and you know like Craig and I in

3571
02:34:33,959 --> 02:34:39,179
building these independent Network

3572
02:34:36,950 --> 02:34:42,500
businesses we try to reach out to

3573
02:34:39,180 --> 02:34:47,130
businesses that hold shared values and

3574
02:34:42,500 --> 02:34:53,478
really make use this organic networking

3575
02:34:47,129 --> 02:34:57,509
as a system of that's a in opposition to

3576
02:34:53,478 --> 02:34:59,279
like it's a whole different value that's

3577
02:34:57,510 --> 02:35:01,228
what I mean it seems like this struggle

3578
02:34:59,280 --> 02:35:04,860
is a value struggle between people who

3579
02:35:01,228 --> 02:35:07,709
are in this a certain way and don't

3580
02:35:04,860 --> 02:35:10,170
don't want to get wrapped into this this

3581
02:35:07,709 --> 02:35:16,339
other value system so how do we build a

3582
02:35:10,170 --> 02:35:23,010
system of independent free thinking

3583
02:35:16,340 --> 02:35:25,228
creative and a whole like network just

3584
02:35:23,010 --> 02:35:28,620
like regenerative farming a regenerative

3585
02:35:25,228 --> 02:35:31,109
economic system where money flows just

3586
02:35:28,620 --> 02:35:36,600
like nutrients flow in the cycles then

3587
02:35:31,110 --> 02:35:40,439
and and and inspire people

3588
02:35:36,600 --> 02:35:42,180
know that exactly that's that's exactly

3589
02:35:40,439 --> 02:35:44,639
what it is and and I think that we don't

3590
02:35:42,180 --> 02:35:48,238
I think that the way that we do it is we

3591
02:35:44,639 --> 02:35:50,579
do it just we don't ask for Christian we

3592
02:35:48,238 --> 02:35:56,010
don't do it because we don't really need

3593
02:35:50,579 --> 02:35:58,379
them to like it or not we got encourage

3594
02:35:56,010 --> 02:36:00,359
that owned by us suddenly a musician

3595
02:35:58,379 --> 02:36:03,028
either the idea of fighting something

3596
02:36:00,359 --> 02:36:05,790
doesn't really need to happen I think we

3597
02:36:03,029 --> 02:36:08,040
can J part of something and lead it and

3598
02:36:05,790 --> 02:36:10,409
sander now I can see your face in there

3599
02:36:08,040 --> 02:36:13,409
girl I know that you have been a really

3600
02:36:10,408 --> 02:36:15,779
big part in getting out the message to

3601
02:36:13,408 --> 02:36:18,600
your community and you're doing a lot

3602
02:36:15,779 --> 02:36:20,880
and creating sacred Commerce and I'm

3603
02:36:18,600 --> 02:36:23,068
just wondering like what kind of things

3604
02:36:20,879 --> 02:36:26,009
have you been up to that have been

3605
02:36:23,068 --> 02:36:27,600
really helpful to your community what

3606
02:36:26,010 --> 02:36:29,609
kind of feedback are you getting from

3607
02:36:27,600 --> 02:36:36,059
consumers for the energy that you're

3608
02:36:29,609 --> 02:36:37,890
putting out people really want to come

3609
02:36:36,059 --> 02:36:39,898
to the farm that's something that I'm

3610
02:36:37,889 --> 02:36:42,840
really noticing people really really

3611
02:36:39,898 --> 02:36:47,398
want to come and see the plant and be

3612
02:36:42,840 --> 02:36:49,619
with it and you know I think there's so

3613
02:36:47,398 --> 02:36:51,689
much content available to everybody

3614
02:36:49,619 --> 02:36:54,470
people are ready to like see the real

3615
02:36:51,689 --> 02:36:54,470
thing too

3616
02:36:54,969 --> 02:37:03,909
yeah that's really really true I almost

3617
02:36:57,760 --> 02:37:06,909
feel like it's a gift to humanity to get

3618
02:37:03,909 --> 02:37:08,469
people on the farm ones that don't have

3619
02:37:06,909 --> 02:37:10,601
the ability to connect with the earth

3620
02:37:08,469 --> 02:37:12,369
ones that are stuck in cities because

3621
02:37:10,601 --> 02:37:13,900
that's the way they live because that's

3622
02:37:12,370 --> 02:37:17,021
what's been given to them because that's

3623
02:37:13,899 --> 02:37:18,789
what they do they it's been a things

3624
02:37:17,021 --> 02:37:21,159
that for hundreds of years people have

3625
02:37:18,790 --> 02:37:23,380
had to go you know go out to to milk a

3626
02:37:21,159 --> 02:37:28,209
cow or you know just there's probably

3627
02:37:23,379 --> 02:37:30,100
like a measurable health impact that you

3628
02:37:28,209 --> 02:37:31,959
would get by you by bringing someone on

3629
02:37:30,101 --> 02:37:34,210
at the farm so I I think maybe I'm

3630
02:37:31,959 --> 02:37:36,129
moving forward it's actually kind of

3631
02:37:34,209 --> 02:37:37,719
difficult I want to say cuz a lot of

3632
02:37:36,129 --> 02:37:40,299
people have wanted to come to our farm

3633
02:37:37,719 --> 02:37:42,909
too it's a bit difficult to manage a

3634
02:37:40,299 --> 02:37:44,739
farm and then have like to manage people

3635
02:37:42,909 --> 02:37:46,959
coming on to the farms and I know

3636
02:37:44,739 --> 02:37:49,090
Craig's and there's a lot of it's kind

3637
02:37:46,959 --> 02:37:51,369
of a thing so big up to you all for

3638
02:37:49,090 --> 02:37:53,620
doing that and are you all finding that

3639
02:37:51,370 --> 02:37:55,720
consumers are coming on to your farm as

3640
02:37:53,620 --> 02:37:57,610
well not only just people that want to

3641
02:37:55,719 --> 02:38:01,539
learn about your growing practices are

3642
02:37:57,610 --> 02:38:04,210
you educating consumers in in on your

3643
02:38:01,540 --> 02:38:05,891
farm visits as well as you know a lot of

3644
02:38:04,209 --> 02:38:09,759
the community work that you all are

3645
02:38:05,890 --> 02:38:11,829
doing well it's kind of really in the

3646
02:38:09,760 --> 02:38:14,530
early stage we haven't you know agreed

3647
02:38:11,829 --> 02:38:15,430
to that much yet but kind of the vibe

3648
02:38:14,530 --> 02:38:19,900
I'm getting

3649
02:38:15,430 --> 02:38:22,540
is that that's one thing that we have to

3650
02:38:19,899 --> 02:38:26,829
offer that's what people want from us

3651
02:38:22,540 --> 02:38:28,780
and so just kind of in the early stage

3652
02:38:26,829 --> 02:38:30,250
is making partnerships like say what's

3653
02:38:28,780 --> 02:38:33,820
soulful for instance like you know if

3654
02:38:30,250 --> 02:38:38,440
they have some customers that are really

3655
02:38:33,819 --> 02:38:42,039
you know maybe through them week they

3656
02:38:38,440 --> 02:38:44,319
can come here kind of just slowly learn

3657
02:38:42,040 --> 02:38:48,101
you know developing relationships with

3658
02:38:44,319 --> 02:38:49,869
partners and starting slow just like

3659
02:38:48,101 --> 02:38:52,601
everything we're not bringing the buses

3660
02:38:49,870 --> 02:38:55,450
you know we got neighbors what happens

3661
02:38:52,601 --> 02:38:58,989
when people imbibe here and leave it's

3662
02:38:55,450 --> 02:39:02,590
just it's complicated so like everything

3663
02:38:58,989 --> 02:39:05,771
just gradually trying it seeing how it

3664
02:39:02,590 --> 02:39:07,870
feels you know there is a really

3665
02:39:05,771 --> 02:39:08,230
important point of autonomy there you

3666
02:39:07,870 --> 02:39:09,730
know

3667
02:39:08,229 --> 02:39:11,529
and for sure you wouldn't be bringing

3668
02:39:09,729 --> 02:39:14,289
biases and there's a lot of farms that

3669
02:39:11,530 --> 02:39:16,780
deal with theft and that's a really big

3670
02:39:14,290 --> 02:39:18,670
issue and I know it's huge I know people

3671
02:39:16,780 --> 02:39:20,610
that have had a lot of those problems so

3672
02:39:18,670 --> 02:39:24,159
you know it's almost like we need like a

3673
02:39:20,610 --> 02:39:26,560
model farm exactly

3674
02:39:24,159 --> 02:39:28,090
cannabis tourism of course this is a job

3675
02:39:26,560 --> 02:39:29,409
you don't even have to sell the cannabis

3676
02:39:28,090 --> 02:39:32,319
at that point in time it's just like a

3677
02:39:29,409 --> 02:39:34,181
farm just come onto our farm like come

3678
02:39:32,319 --> 02:39:36,190
check out and you can grow some you can

3679
02:39:34,181 --> 02:39:38,079
take a clone you can kind of get your

3680
02:39:36,190 --> 02:39:39,970
hands dirty get involved understand

3681
02:39:38,079 --> 02:39:41,440
what's going on here tore the whole

3682
02:39:39,969 --> 02:39:45,340
place that's going to be a thing for

3683
02:39:41,440 --> 02:39:48,970
sure people will plant farms and grown

3684
02:39:45,340 --> 02:39:52,390
again two years in a row they planted

3685
02:39:48,969 --> 02:39:59,079
like to several acre field and then may

3686
02:39:52,390 --> 02:40:02,949
the maize get to go through the maze

3687
02:39:59,079 --> 02:40:05,289
it was Maori health plate that's awesome

3688
02:40:02,950 --> 02:40:07,630
you're going to make a kinship ganja

3689
02:40:05,290 --> 02:40:10,120
maze where the beginning of the maze is

3690
02:40:07,629 --> 02:40:12,850
the land races from different country is

3691
02:40:10,120 --> 02:40:15,190
that as you walk through the maze the

3692
02:40:12,851 --> 02:40:17,560
the crosses come and you see the

3693
02:40:15,190 --> 02:40:19,569
original skunks come out and then all of

3694
02:40:17,560 --> 02:40:21,431
a sudden the skunk's gonna Northern

3695
02:40:19,569 --> 02:40:23,199
Lights grow and the G that all of a

3696
02:40:21,431 --> 02:40:25,690
sudden we're into by the end we're to

3697
02:40:23,200 --> 02:40:27,670
work off your field of coffee you know

3698
02:40:25,690 --> 02:40:29,010
what I mean like that would be so let's

3699
02:40:27,670 --> 02:40:32,950
do that

3700
02:40:29,010 --> 02:40:35,649
yeah like from pike from you know go

3701
02:40:32,950 --> 02:40:39,610
from garden to you know path down to

3702
02:40:35,649 --> 02:40:44,039
another it could be amazing I mean they

3703
02:40:39,610 --> 02:40:48,400
do it with wineries African section a

3704
02:40:44,040 --> 02:40:50,400
Indian section I like it we're all sold

3705
02:40:48,399 --> 02:40:53,649
we're all like yeah let's do this

3706
02:40:50,399 --> 02:40:57,149
like the mom we're trying to create

3707
02:40:53,649 --> 02:41:07,869
there there is institutions and

3708
02:40:57,149 --> 02:41:09,909
education it's a different there's

3709
02:41:07,870 --> 02:41:11,891
there's an institution facility that

3710
02:41:09,909 --> 02:41:13,690
people can custody of it there you know

3711
02:41:11,890 --> 02:41:16,149
the piece of property where you can you

3712
02:41:13,690 --> 02:41:18,010
can see all of the cultivars that are

3713
02:41:16,149 --> 02:41:20,890
being used and why they're being used

3714
02:41:18,010 --> 02:41:21,609
and I think that it is the next step in

3715
02:41:20,890 --> 02:41:24,219
cannabis

3716
02:41:21,609 --> 02:41:26,168
to give her her time so that people from

3717
02:41:24,219 --> 02:41:28,688
the outside can understand the history

3718
02:41:26,168 --> 02:41:31,059
of it and how we've moved this forward

3719
02:41:28,689 --> 02:41:33,668
and also have a place of Education where

3720
02:41:31,059 --> 02:41:35,618
everybody it can put into it that would

3721
02:41:33,668 --> 02:41:37,809
be really wonderful and it is something

3722
02:41:35,619 --> 02:41:39,699
that we are working on right now and by

3723
02:41:37,809 --> 02:41:41,918
all of us joining together in all of

3724
02:41:39,699 --> 02:41:45,010
these different regions we have the

3725
02:41:41,918 --> 02:41:47,139
ability to make that shine maybe in the

3726
02:41:45,010 --> 02:41:49,209
next five or ten years because we're

3727
02:41:47,139 --> 02:41:53,349
gathering information now from each

3728
02:41:49,209 --> 02:41:55,390
other and you know farming is not just a

3729
02:41:53,350 --> 02:41:57,600
thing for California and Southern Oregon

3730
02:41:55,389 --> 02:42:00,340
you know there's the sort of thought

3731
02:41:57,600 --> 02:42:02,729
that is you farther you go north you

3732
02:42:00,340 --> 02:42:04,418
know the more you got to go indoors and

3733
02:42:02,728 --> 02:42:06,639
it's not true

3734
02:42:04,418 --> 02:42:08,949
I mean we we don't grow indoors you know

3735
02:42:06,639 --> 02:42:11,318
we might start some of our seeds

3736
02:42:08,949 --> 02:42:14,439
initially under life because we do have

3737
02:42:11,318 --> 02:42:16,418
a shorter season and it's biting cold in

3738
02:42:14,439 --> 02:42:20,199
the spring and it's biting cold in the

3739
02:42:16,418 --> 02:42:23,289
fall so we do have a window but we grow

3740
02:42:20,199 --> 02:42:26,649
amazing cultivars up here in Canada in

3741
02:42:23,289 --> 02:42:29,199
native soil and that means that anyone

3742
02:42:26,648 --> 02:42:30,939
below us can do it and a lot of people I

3743
02:42:29,199 --> 02:42:32,739
know there's people in Alaska doing it

3744
02:42:30,939 --> 02:42:34,930
we talked to a lot of time in fact Jeff

3745
02:42:32,738 --> 02:42:37,180
lowenfeld is one of the most you know

3746
02:42:34,930 --> 02:42:38,770
well known people in cannabis and he's

3747
02:42:37,180 --> 02:42:40,720
in Anchorage and he's helping gardeners

3748
02:42:38,770 --> 02:42:42,399
all the time in Alaska so a lot like

3749
02:42:40,719 --> 02:42:44,978
Craig was saying he you know you're just

3750
02:42:42,398 --> 02:42:47,498
putting over you know it's basically a

3751
02:42:44,978 --> 02:42:49,148
cover to be able to open up your

3752
02:42:47,498 --> 02:42:51,398
greenhouse so that you can do your

3753
02:42:49,148 --> 02:42:53,318
lighting and that no dust or anything

3754
02:42:51,398 --> 02:42:56,049
gets on that we're doing the same exact

3755
02:42:53,318 --> 02:42:57,878
thing I'm Jaron BC because we're finding

3756
02:42:56,049 --> 02:42:59,918
that if we close up our greenhouses at

3757
02:42:57,879 --> 02:43:02,529
all we're just allowing pathogens to

3758
02:42:59,918 --> 02:43:05,049
breed and and we're really taking on a

3759
02:43:02,529 --> 02:43:07,060
lot of what northern County has taught

3760
02:43:05,049 --> 02:43:08,799
the industry and now we've been doing

3761
02:43:07,059 --> 02:43:10,948
that up here for over ten years and

3762
02:43:08,799 --> 02:43:13,658
that's what works for us so the idea of

3763
02:43:10,949 --> 02:43:16,418
you know that you can't run certain

3764
02:43:13,658 --> 02:43:18,850
cultivars in northern areas the key is

3765
02:43:16,418 --> 02:43:21,609
that not that you can't run them the key

3766
02:43:18,850 --> 02:43:23,649
is when are you finished so light that

3767
02:43:21,609 --> 02:43:26,379
being and being able to grow in terroir

3768
02:43:23,648 --> 02:43:28,148
and being able to grow in natural Sun is

3769
02:43:26,379 --> 02:43:30,819
very powerful for lots of different

3770
02:43:28,148 --> 02:43:31,448
reasons number one economics to the

3771
02:43:30,818 --> 02:43:33,248
farmer

3772
02:43:31,449 --> 02:43:35,109
number two we feel like it's a higher

3773
02:43:33,248 --> 02:43:36,818
quality product numbers

3774
02:43:35,109 --> 02:43:39,100
it's better for the environment and

3775
02:43:36,818 --> 02:43:41,859
number four it creates more community

3776
02:43:39,100 --> 02:43:43,418
and families and education around what

3777
02:43:41,859 --> 02:43:45,488
it is to actually grow in the earth

3778
02:43:43,418 --> 02:43:47,139
where plants actually come from and

3779
02:43:45,488 --> 02:43:51,219
that's come from the earth and number

3780
02:43:47,139 --> 02:43:52,898
five is that it is an economically smart

3781
02:43:51,219 --> 02:43:54,818
and intelligent way to move your

3782
02:43:52,898 --> 02:43:56,708
business forward especially up in the

3783
02:43:54,818 --> 02:44:00,038
north where you think it has to all be

3784
02:43:56,709 --> 02:44:02,409
grown hydroponically indoors which is

3785
02:44:00,039 --> 02:44:04,959
that's the joke but you know I think

3786
02:44:02,408 --> 02:44:06,368
that any producer up here in British

3787
02:44:04,959 --> 02:44:08,379
Columbia and as soon as you get over

3788
02:44:06,369 --> 02:44:10,180
towards the coast and Vancouver and you

3789
02:44:08,379 --> 02:44:12,729
get into the Gulf Islands I mean there's

3790
02:44:10,180 --> 02:44:14,260
a lot of potential over there to grow

3791
02:44:12,728 --> 02:44:15,578
underneath the Sun and I think it's

3792
02:44:14,260 --> 02:44:17,800
going to be essential for people to do

3793
02:44:15,578 --> 02:44:19,658
that so the collection of people here

3794
02:44:17,799 --> 02:44:22,208
from all different places all of these

3795
02:44:19,658 --> 02:44:23,799
lessons really we are all sharing

3796
02:44:22,209 --> 02:44:28,300
something that works for each other and

3797
02:44:23,799 --> 02:44:31,719
now we can use these forward and we got

3798
02:44:28,299 --> 02:44:32,918
to get good growing techniques more of

3799
02:44:31,719 --> 02:44:35,828
them happening up here in British

3800
02:44:32,918 --> 02:44:43,090
Columbia so Marcus has enough glands to

3801
02:44:35,828 --> 02:44:44,648
work with I need those glands

3802
02:44:43,090 --> 02:44:46,869
I need those glands I got I got some

3803
02:44:44,648 --> 02:44:50,948
glands here I got a little little bit of

3804
02:44:46,869 --> 02:44:53,619
Glen's yeah I was gonna speak to the

3805
02:44:50,949 --> 02:44:55,930
point about the type of farm everyone

3806
02:44:53,619 --> 02:44:59,010
was describing and that is precisely

3807
02:44:55,930 --> 02:45:03,850
what we have built out at alpenglow and

3808
02:44:59,010 --> 02:45:06,369
ladye sativa it's this discovery when

3809
02:45:03,850 --> 02:45:08,818
someone comes they can discover the land

3810
02:45:06,369 --> 02:45:13,180
and discover the different cultivars and

3811
02:45:08,818 --> 02:45:16,359
realize this this path literally a path

3812
02:45:13,180 --> 02:45:21,520
they can walk down for us they can walk

3813
02:45:16,359 --> 02:45:21,939
past 45 years of huar and that means to

3814
02:45:21,520 --> 02:45:24,640
me

3815
02:45:21,939 --> 02:45:26,408
I know 45 years ago on this ridge line

3816
02:45:24,639 --> 02:45:28,748
we're standing next to some pots that

3817
02:45:26,408 --> 02:45:30,430
were nailed to the trees I knew the

3818
02:45:28,748 --> 02:45:34,059
neighbor got busted by airplanes

3819
02:45:30,430 --> 02:45:35,738
45 years ago right here so that's that's

3820
02:45:34,059 --> 02:45:37,628
really interesting the folks to know

3821
02:45:35,738 --> 02:45:38,948
that they're standing where where

3822
02:45:37,629 --> 02:45:41,829
there's a lot of history with the

3823
02:45:38,949 --> 02:45:44,168
cultivation and then some of the other

3824
02:45:41,828 --> 02:45:46,359
things we've done is we have with easy

3825
02:45:44,168 --> 02:45:48,850
access because not everyone can access

3826
02:45:46,359 --> 02:45:51,399
the remote parts of the farm but

3827
02:45:48,850 --> 02:45:55,300
at lady sativa and at alpenglow right

3828
02:45:51,399 --> 02:45:59,829
outside our our main parking spaces you

3829
02:45:55,299 --> 02:46:01,270
can walk through a whole example of the

3830
02:45:59,829 --> 02:46:04,799
different cultivars that are on the farm

3831
02:46:01,271 --> 02:46:08,710
lady sativa Rio he had every example of

3832
02:46:04,799 --> 02:46:11,020
of all his plants and strains right

3833
02:46:08,709 --> 02:46:13,389
right at the top of the ridge and then

3834
02:46:11,021 --> 02:46:15,790
then you walk down through just like you

3835
02:46:13,389 --> 02:46:18,010
said those corn mazes literally there

3836
02:46:15,790 --> 02:46:19,780
was cannabis mazes took you all the way

3837
02:46:18,010 --> 02:46:21,969
down to the property and then we we

3838
02:46:19,780 --> 02:46:24,239
would walk a goat path through the woods

3839
02:46:21,969 --> 02:46:26,439
and end up at the sunset point and

3840
02:46:24,239 --> 02:46:28,930
walking that goat path made us think

3841
02:46:26,440 --> 02:46:31,930
about how it was maybe 25 years ago with

3842
02:46:28,930 --> 02:46:33,521
a with a bag of inputs over the shoulder

3843
02:46:31,930 --> 02:46:35,620
and we're able to tell some of these

3844
02:46:33,521 --> 02:46:38,380
stories and share the history and it's

3845
02:46:35,620 --> 02:46:40,630
been just super super amazing the

3846
02:46:38,379 --> 02:46:42,699
response we get and that the giggle

3847
02:46:40,629 --> 02:46:49,869
factor people get when leaves are

3848
02:46:42,700 --> 02:46:51,700
brushing their cheeks yeah the trees is

3849
02:46:49,870 --> 02:46:52,450
probably really healing to us all too

3850
02:46:51,700 --> 02:46:53,740
amazing

3851
02:46:52,450 --> 02:46:58,900
maybe I'm can you tell us some about

3852
02:46:53,739 --> 02:47:01,329
your African cultivars Rio yeah I need

3853
02:46:58,899 --> 02:47:04,750
to get you guys those I'm product I

3854
02:47:01,329 --> 02:47:08,709
cross him on a cherry pie with Durbin

3855
02:47:04,750 --> 02:47:11,469
poison this year which I think it's

3856
02:47:08,709 --> 02:47:15,520
gonna come in a little earlier but this

3857
02:47:11,469 --> 02:47:20,250
yeah ramani I still have that Kenyan

3858
02:47:15,521 --> 02:47:22,720
bush weed which is the super spicy I

3859
02:47:20,250 --> 02:47:25,809
don't know what to do with that I was

3860
02:47:22,719 --> 02:47:30,250
gonna bring it to an OG or something so

3861
02:47:25,809 --> 02:47:32,709
it had like a peppery spice and then we

3862
02:47:30,250 --> 02:47:35,920
still have this Colombian bars but they

3863
02:47:32,709 --> 02:47:39,069
I mean they're still out there they're

3864
02:47:35,920 --> 02:47:41,739
probably not coming into like late

3865
02:47:39,069 --> 02:47:44,860
December so I don't they don't really

3866
02:47:41,739 --> 02:47:47,289
produce up here but cross sing them into

3867
02:47:44,860 --> 02:47:50,069
earlier others the teams this is

3868
02:47:47,290 --> 02:47:52,870
something that I'm still playing with um

3869
02:47:50,069 --> 02:47:55,270
but the people when they see the sativa

3870
02:47:52,870 --> 02:47:59,050
next to the indica in the same garden

3871
02:47:55,271 --> 02:48:01,780
that's exciting you know when they see

3872
02:47:59,049 --> 02:48:02,739
the thin leaf plants and the broadleaf

3873
02:48:01,780 --> 02:48:06,579
plants and the

3874
02:48:02,739 --> 02:48:10,329
short squatty plants and they see them

3875
02:48:06,579 --> 02:48:13,420
all together it's like a whole different

3876
02:48:10,329 --> 02:48:16,299
form of Agriculture so it's inspiring

3877
02:48:13,420 --> 02:48:18,190
and they're big enough they were big

3878
02:48:16,299 --> 02:48:20,890
enough before we harvested that there's

3879
02:48:18,190 --> 02:48:26,200
a tunnel maze that you literally walk

3880
02:48:20,890 --> 02:48:28,810
down a path and they're 14 feet tall and

3881
02:48:26,200 --> 02:48:30,431
you going through the maze and then you

3882
02:48:28,810 --> 02:48:33,369
come out to the different views and

3883
02:48:30,431 --> 02:48:36,579
that's our goal is to have these forest

3884
02:48:33,370 --> 02:48:39,311
paths and then have native plant species

3885
02:48:36,579 --> 02:48:42,521
that are endemic to this area and have

3886
02:48:39,310 --> 02:48:44,500
different herbs and really cultivate the

3887
02:48:42,521 --> 02:48:46,989
whole landscape which fits into the

3888
02:48:44,500 --> 02:48:52,271
whole but bioregional or regenerative

3889
02:48:46,989 --> 02:48:58,360
thing anyway is really re redefine the

3890
02:48:52,271 --> 02:49:02,290
garden spaces the entire um just

3891
02:48:58,360 --> 02:49:04,690
somebody tried to call me and not just

3892
02:49:02,290 --> 02:49:07,590
cannabis but all the other herbs and all

3893
02:49:04,690 --> 02:49:10,810
the and I'm still learning so I

3894
02:49:07,590 --> 02:49:18,489
continuously hired new permaculture it's

3895
02:49:10,810 --> 02:49:22,181
a life journey I seem to reinvest all my

3896
02:49:18,489 --> 02:49:24,369
money on plants but I think that you

3897
02:49:22,181 --> 02:49:26,140
brought up something I think you brought

3898
02:49:24,370 --> 02:49:28,510
up something really important Rio choose

3899
02:49:26,140 --> 02:49:31,270
that you know if you were saying it runs

3900
02:49:28,510 --> 02:49:33,130
into the whole regenerative movement you

3901
02:49:31,271 --> 02:49:35,130
know as far as like you're growing all

3902
02:49:33,129 --> 02:49:38,319
of these different cultivars and and

3903
02:49:35,129 --> 02:49:41,289
it's like you're not pushing cultivars

3904
02:49:38,319 --> 02:49:43,720
that you know to grow in your area

3905
02:49:41,290 --> 02:49:46,210
you're allowing your area to grow

3906
02:49:43,720 --> 02:49:49,060
certain cultivars what is it that's

3907
02:49:46,209 --> 02:49:51,579
gonna have amazing success what is it

3908
02:49:49,060 --> 02:49:54,431
that we call biological intelligence in

3909
02:49:51,579 --> 02:49:57,459
your zone an area and I just think that

3910
02:49:54,431 --> 02:50:00,460
you touched on absolute gold there that

3911
02:49:57,459 --> 02:50:02,739
it can be so helpful to educate a lot of

3912
02:50:00,459 --> 02:50:05,500
farmers out there to really be growing

3913
02:50:02,739 --> 02:50:08,949
what works in your zone and area and

3914
02:50:05,500 --> 02:50:15,940
have success in that and to test it out

3915
02:50:08,950 --> 02:50:16,450
so you know I probably lose 20 plants a

3916
02:50:15,940 --> 02:50:19,989
year

3917
02:50:16,450 --> 02:50:22,120
but at least I that's my favorite part

3918
02:50:19,989 --> 02:50:25,689
of the whole thing is to test something

3919
02:50:22,120 --> 02:50:27,939
out and see how it does and then to take

3920
02:50:25,689 --> 02:50:30,100
a make across with something that you

3921
02:50:27,939 --> 02:50:32,950
think that would bring it back into

3922
02:50:30,100 --> 02:50:36,100
looking in the area and I think does

3923
02:50:32,950 --> 02:50:39,220
land race trains going back onto those

3924
02:50:36,100 --> 02:50:41,350
early land race trains mate makes the

3925
02:50:39,219 --> 02:50:44,469
plants so healthy like that shesh Amani

3926
02:50:41,350 --> 02:50:49,390
cherry pot now is amazing there's a few

3927
02:50:44,469 --> 02:50:53,529
different types and fie knows but uh it

3928
02:50:49,389 --> 02:50:58,510
seems like the DAPs more over time to

3929
02:50:53,530 --> 02:51:00,340
your area at least climatized i mean i

3930
02:50:58,510 --> 02:51:02,050
yeah i think we've made a lot of seeds

3931
02:51:00,340 --> 02:51:04,478
up beer and brought him you know down

3932
02:51:02,049 --> 02:51:06,219
south down there and and a lot of the

3933
02:51:04,478 --> 02:51:08,228
reaction we get is that there's just an

3934
02:51:06,219 --> 02:51:09,728
incredible amount of bigger - and stuff

3935
02:51:08,228 --> 02:51:11,619
so I think you know it's just hard

3936
02:51:09,728 --> 02:51:13,389
environment up here it grows good down

3937
02:51:11,620 --> 02:51:15,729
there you know I think it's enough

3938
02:51:13,389 --> 02:51:18,159
that's not bioregional but I mean that's

3939
02:51:15,728 --> 02:51:20,799
using the earth and it's different

3940
02:51:18,159 --> 02:51:23,020
environments and and - for the benefit

3941
02:51:20,799 --> 02:51:25,599
of all but yeah climate izing it's that

3942
02:51:23,020 --> 02:51:26,950
you see it over a year one year of doing

3943
02:51:25,600 --> 02:51:29,500
that work then next year you'll see

3944
02:51:26,950 --> 02:51:36,130
results it may not be your end result

3945
02:51:29,500 --> 02:51:39,879
but it's going to be a result yeah as

3946
02:51:36,129 --> 02:51:41,859
well we we had the sillies gift from you

3947
02:51:39,879 --> 02:51:44,409
guys Ellie's or Zoe's gift by

3948
02:51:41,860 --> 02:51:47,829
homesteader and at the end that plant

3949
02:51:44,409 --> 02:51:50,350
needed no structure it made it through

3950
02:51:47,829 --> 02:51:54,789
the rains it was an incredible

3951
02:51:50,350 --> 02:51:56,409
incredible plant so strong when people

3952
02:51:54,790 --> 02:51:58,210
would take our tour we have this zone

3953
02:51:56,409 --> 02:52:00,189
that has a lot of different examples

3954
02:51:58,209 --> 02:52:04,899
that were testing and it was just a lone

3955
02:52:00,189 --> 02:52:07,000
plant by itself and and just we have to

3956
02:52:04,899 --> 02:52:10,299
keep going at this you know we we try to

3957
02:52:07,000 --> 02:52:13,270
feel that we're biology and to are

3958
02:52:10,299 --> 02:52:16,959
driven farm and that means sharing these

3959
02:52:13,270 --> 02:52:18,310
cultivars amongst ourselves and trying

3960
02:52:16,959 --> 02:52:19,839
to figure out what works and what

3961
02:52:18,309 --> 02:52:22,809
doesn't and reaching out to this

3962
02:52:19,840 --> 02:52:24,610
community riyo's farm i he pulls out a

3963
02:52:22,809 --> 02:52:25,629
strain list well we'll have our session

3964
02:52:24,610 --> 02:52:27,579
and we'll figure out what we're gonna

3965
02:52:25,629 --> 02:52:30,099
plant and what seeds the crack and share

3966
02:52:27,579 --> 02:52:30,370
and my goodness he starts opening up the

3967
02:52:30,100 --> 02:52:32,530
baa

3968
02:52:30,370 --> 02:52:34,149
is in the boxes in the boxes and I I try

3969
02:52:32,530 --> 02:52:36,550
to be a little more defined with having

3970
02:52:34,148 --> 02:52:37,719
four or five cultivars and he just keeps

3971
02:52:36,549 --> 02:52:39,849
bringing them out and it's like this

3972
02:52:37,719 --> 02:52:41,438
Pandora's box you want to go deeper and

3973
02:52:39,850 --> 02:52:45,720
deeper but you know you're gonna get in

3974
02:52:41,439 --> 02:52:48,370
trouble in a good way

3975
02:52:45,719 --> 02:52:50,049
sometimes good that's sweet and I think

3976
02:52:48,370 --> 02:52:51,460
that it's so important for us to share

3977
02:52:50,049 --> 02:52:53,699
cultivars you know I'm gonna bring it

3978
02:52:51,459 --> 02:52:56,559
back to Kai I mean growing your coffee

3979
02:52:53,700 --> 02:52:59,140
you know we were actually able to keep a

3980
02:52:56,559 --> 02:53:01,059
clone on the very last day that we

3981
02:52:59,139 --> 02:53:03,639
harvested that plant and we're really

3982
02:53:01,059 --> 02:53:06,459
excited to bring her back she was just

3983
02:53:03,639 --> 02:53:08,799
so beautiful and we could feel love and

3984
02:53:06,459 --> 02:53:10,929
intention so Craig you're talking about

3985
02:53:08,799 --> 02:53:13,358
growing our genetics and REO were really

3986
02:53:10,930 --> 02:53:16,389
stoked about the Shasha money I mean to

3987
02:53:13,359 --> 02:53:18,609
partake in smoking one of those Shasha

3988
02:53:16,389 --> 02:53:21,519
monies was a really special evening on

3989
02:53:18,609 --> 02:53:24,280
your farm and I'd love to marry there on

3990
02:53:21,520 --> 02:53:27,010
the farm there - yeah a little crew yeah

3991
02:53:24,280 --> 02:53:29,229
and and and the coyote blue what a

3992
02:53:27,010 --> 02:53:31,030
wonderful strain so if we share this

3993
02:53:29,228 --> 02:53:33,639
with each other that we can really not

3994
02:53:31,030 --> 02:53:35,770
only you know without being like too far

3995
02:53:33,639 --> 02:53:37,209
out there in the spiritual zone but you

3996
02:53:35,770 --> 02:53:39,130
know to be able to feel each other's

3997
02:53:37,209 --> 02:53:41,529
energy grow it on our farm and see how

3998
02:53:39,129 --> 02:53:42,188
it does careful in the spiritual er I

3999
02:53:41,530 --> 02:53:47,409
can't help

4000
02:53:42,189 --> 02:53:49,720
careful oh my god so you know it's it's

4001
02:53:47,409 --> 02:53:52,719
it's like on one level we're just trying

4002
02:53:49,719 --> 02:53:55,090
to exist and and on another level we're

4003
02:53:52,719 --> 02:53:57,159
just we're just throwing a Hail Mary and

4004
02:53:55,090 --> 02:53:59,710
shooting for the you know hitting a home

4005
02:53:57,159 --> 02:54:01,989
run because we want the earth to be

4006
02:53:59,709 --> 02:54:04,239
healthy to it so we're we're really just

4007
02:54:01,989 --> 02:54:06,939
going for the home run you know we're

4008
02:54:04,239 --> 02:54:10,030
gonna go for a healthy environment good

4009
02:54:06,939 --> 02:54:12,760
genetics and a real prosperous amazing

4010
02:54:10,030 --> 02:54:14,320
business so you know we in that Bri can

4011
02:54:12,760 --> 02:54:16,000
have it only we can have it all there

4012
02:54:14,319 --> 02:54:17,920
there was a movie just made in on the

4013
02:54:16,000 --> 02:54:20,020
Gila River there are rivers last chance

4014
02:54:17,920 --> 02:54:22,600
and and bio vortex and the regenerative

4015
02:54:20,020 --> 02:54:24,930
farm or Jesse and and high tide they

4016
02:54:22,600 --> 02:54:27,550
were all doing really amazing

4017
02:54:24,930 --> 02:54:29,620
documentation in the movie about how the

4018
02:54:27,549 --> 02:54:32,709
river has changed and how salmon have

4019
02:54:29,620 --> 02:54:35,140
come back not just on you know farming

4020
02:54:32,709 --> 02:54:37,179
but also logging practices and stuff so

4021
02:54:35,139 --> 02:54:39,369
when how the regenerative cannabis

4022
02:54:37,180 --> 02:54:41,930
movement is helping the OU River to come

4023
02:54:39,370 --> 02:54:44,149
back and how there's the legal crop

4024
02:54:41,930 --> 02:54:46,068
with the NPK and the synthetic

4025
02:54:44,148 --> 02:54:46,639
fertilizers were were killing the

4026
02:54:46,068 --> 02:54:48,859
Salmons

4027
02:54:46,639 --> 02:54:50,478
let's say it is empowering let's think

4028
02:54:48,859 --> 02:54:52,789
of ourselves is all part of the same

4029
02:54:50,478 --> 02:54:54,618
team because you know up here in a lot

4030
02:54:52,789 --> 02:54:57,680
of places in British Columbia are filled

4031
02:54:54,619 --> 02:54:59,810
with radical conscientious objectors

4032
02:54:57,680 --> 02:55:01,668
that came up from California to avoid

4033
02:54:59,809 --> 02:55:04,010
the war and they came out to live on the

4034
02:55:01,668 --> 02:55:06,318
land and cultivate genetics and those

4035
02:55:04,010 --> 02:55:08,719
people brought you know genetics from

4036
02:55:06,318 --> 02:55:10,908
California to British Columbia way back

4037
02:55:08,719 --> 02:55:13,788
in you know the early seventies and

4038
02:55:10,908 --> 02:55:16,219
stuff and we are all the same we can fly

4039
02:55:13,789 --> 02:55:18,050
a different flag we can maybe we have to

4040
02:55:16,219 --> 02:55:20,658
answer to different agencies and stuff

4041
02:55:18,049 --> 02:55:22,998
but wait we are one family and we're

4042
02:55:20,658 --> 02:55:26,840
every time we put a plant in the earth

4043
02:55:22,998 --> 02:55:28,340
we're planting in the same pot our hands

4044
02:55:26,840 --> 02:55:31,189
in the same dirt we have the same

4045
02:55:28,340 --> 02:55:33,260
microbiome and and and and I we just

4046
02:55:31,189 --> 02:55:34,609
have a tremendous and respect for

4047
02:55:33,260 --> 02:55:37,578
everything they just want everyone to

4048
02:55:34,609 --> 02:55:40,578
know we're gonna fight and maybe it's

4049
02:55:37,578 --> 02:55:42,859
not a fight you're gonna join we're

4050
02:55:40,578 --> 02:55:44,510
gonna just live we're gonna live and

4051
02:55:42,859 --> 02:55:46,818
we're gonna show it can be done and I

4052
02:55:44,510 --> 02:55:49,340
wanted to really you know we are riding

4053
02:55:46,818 --> 02:55:51,379
on the coattails you know Sam you remind

4054
02:55:49,340 --> 02:55:53,478
us often that it's not really maybe

4055
02:55:51,379 --> 02:55:56,509
landrace trains but we're working with

4056
02:55:53,478 --> 02:55:58,368
landraces strains because of the hard

4057
02:55:56,510 --> 02:56:00,590
work that has been done before us and

4058
02:55:58,369 --> 02:56:03,529
there's not even a part of us that is

4059
02:56:00,590 --> 02:56:05,359
letting go you know all of that good

4060
02:56:03,529 --> 02:56:07,340
advice and all those good genetics that

4061
02:56:05,359 --> 02:56:09,050
have been sent down to us and we just

4062
02:56:07,340 --> 02:56:11,209
really want to continue running with it

4063
02:56:09,049 --> 02:56:13,188
because our children now are a part of

4064
02:56:11,209 --> 02:56:14,600
this and they're a huge part of our

4065
02:56:13,189 --> 02:56:16,699
business and we actually wouldn't have a

4066
02:56:14,600 --> 02:56:19,130
business or harvest at all if it weren't

4067
02:56:16,699 --> 02:56:20,689
for our kids and I want to pass down the

4068
02:56:19,129 --> 02:56:24,049
best to them and I just want to thank

4069
02:56:20,689 --> 02:56:25,880
you too Sam for being that generation

4070
02:56:24,049 --> 02:56:28,549
before us to help pack Soundwave and

4071
02:56:25,879 --> 02:56:31,158
every way and everyone else who is an

4072
02:56:28,549 --> 02:56:32,988
elder toss and the Harlequin wow it's

4073
02:56:31,158 --> 02:56:35,148
really changed the industry you know you

4074
02:56:32,988 --> 02:56:37,549
doing that hard work now has passed it

4075
02:56:35,148 --> 02:56:39,469
on to all of us that we can continue

4076
02:56:37,549 --> 02:56:41,299
moving forward and healing the plant and

4077
02:56:39,469 --> 02:56:43,488
healing the soil and healing the nation

4078
02:56:41,299 --> 02:56:45,590
Thank You Josh Joshua for putting

4079
02:56:43,488 --> 02:56:47,478
together an event that highlights

4080
02:56:45,590 --> 02:56:50,600
growing practices that I want to

4081
02:56:47,478 --> 02:56:53,179
encourage everyone to look at the the

4082
02:56:50,600 --> 02:56:55,159
regenerative science of regenerative

4083
02:56:53,180 --> 02:56:57,200
cannabis as

4084
02:56:55,159 --> 02:56:59,629
and and especially here in British

4085
02:56:57,200 --> 02:57:01,370
Columbia I'd like I'd like to see a good

4086
02:56:59,629 --> 02:57:03,589
turnout here in British Columbia because

4087
02:57:01,370 --> 02:57:05,300
we don't up here we don't get the same

4088
02:57:03,590 --> 02:57:07,460
type of exposure as Oregon and

4089
02:57:05,299 --> 02:57:10,009
California and even Washington gets so

4090
02:57:07,459 --> 02:57:11,689
this is a huge opportunity for people in

4091
02:57:10,010 --> 02:57:13,579
British Columbia to come together and

4092
02:57:11,690 --> 02:57:16,909
have and have our voices heard

4093
02:57:13,579 --> 02:57:20,319
we are meeting up with really missing

4094
02:57:16,909 --> 02:57:23,030
contours up here in British Columbia I

4095
02:57:20,319 --> 02:57:27,770
like to say that British Columbia is

4096
02:57:23,030 --> 02:57:29,000
making a scene making a big a big splash

4097
02:57:27,771 --> 02:57:33,500
in the industry and we're gonna

4098
02:57:29,000 --> 02:57:35,601
highlight part of the reason why even

4099
02:57:33,500 --> 02:57:38,719
has a place on this map is because of

4100
02:57:35,601 --> 02:57:40,670
Marcus because of this ability Marcus

4101
02:57:38,719 --> 02:57:42,920

4102
02:57:40,670 --> 02:57:44,989
when it wasn't even cool when it was

4103
02:57:42,920 --> 02:57:47,390
totally illegal and people didn't even

4104
02:57:44,989 --> 02:57:49,399
know what a resident had was and the

4105
02:57:47,390 --> 02:57:52,369
education that you brought forward and

4106

I felt like it's been kind of too long

4124
02:58:36,920 --> 02:58:41,420
we've been talking about doing an

4125
02:58:38,239 --> 02:58:43,190
episode for a while I'm busy I am so

4126
02:58:41,420 --> 02:58:44,601
busy these days with all these different

4127
02:58:43,190 --> 02:58:45,649
projects that I'm working on and they're

4128
02:58:44,601 --> 02:58:47,420
pulling me in all these different

4129
02:58:45,649 --> 02:58:50,000
directions and I just don't have the

4130
02:58:47,420 --> 02:58:52,219
same amount of time that I used to but I

02:59:13,408 --> 02:59:18,088
top of the conversation helping direct

4144
02:59:15,029 --> 02:59:20,520
and move it and that does that does take

4145
02:59:18,088 --> 02:59:22,408
energy so I don't have all that energy

4146
02:59:20,520 --> 02:59:24,689
to give like I used to but I'm

4147
02:59:22,408 --> 02:59:27,148
definitely gonna try and do my own shows

4148
02:59:24,689 --> 02:59:28,498
as well but it's it's a community thing

4171
03:00:22,408 --> 03:00:26,189
would be happy to organize with other

4172
03:00:24,270 --> 03:00:28,439
groups and there's a lot of people that

4173
03:00:26,189 --> 03:00:30,869
have really good mortises and we're only

4174
03:00:28,439 --> 03:00:33,238
a representation of all those voices so

4175
03:00:30,869 --> 03:00:34,979

4176

respect you and we would love to create

4177

space for you as well and anyone that

4178
03:00:37,408 --> 03:00:40,949
wants the link with anyone that's on the

4179
03:00:39,029 --> 03:00:43,949
panel if you go to my Instagram BC

4180
03:00:40,949 --> 03:00:45,959
bubbleman you'll find all of their

4181
03:00:43,949 --> 03:00:47,429
Instagram links and you'll be able to

4182
03:00:45,959 --> 03:00:49,679
private message them and get in touch

4183
03:00:47,429 --> 03:00:51,418
with them and thank you everyone for I

4184
03:00:49,679 --> 03:00:53,908
think it was like a hundred and ten

4185
03:00:51,418 --> 03:00:55,350
bucks that was donated during the show

4186
03:00:53,908 --> 03:00:58,859
that I'll be sending over to the khalad

4187
03:00:55,350 --> 03:01:00,689
rias network it was I don't know if it's

4188
03:00:58,859 --> 03:01:02,549
us I don't know if it's Canadian but

4189
03:01:00,689 --> 03:01:04,529
I'll figure it out I usually just send a

4190
03:01:02,549 --> 03:01:13,369
little extra on top of that I'll

4191
03:01:04,529 --> 03:01:15,869
probably match what was given here so I

4192
03:01:13,369 --> 03:01:18,270
want to encourage all those farms in

4193
03:01:15,869 --> 03:01:21,359
Cali that can donate as well as Pelagius

4194
