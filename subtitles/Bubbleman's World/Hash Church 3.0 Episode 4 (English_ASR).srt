1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:08,580

that the channels back after six weeks

6
00:00:15,298 --> 00:00:20,730
of pretty much being hacked and

7
00:00:17,489 --> 00:00:25,649
controlled by a Bitcoin scammer and now

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:27,990
it seems as though the videos are all

9
00:00:25,649 --> 00:00:29,489
gone we're gonna try and hope and get

10
00:00:27,989 --> 00:00:31,079
those back but the bottom line is the

11
00:00:29,489 --> 00:00:33,808
channels back we've got the community

12
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:37,589
and we're able to do hash search in

13
00:00:33,808 --> 00:00:40,019
these other shows and look who's here at

14

I'm excited I'm just happy really to be

36
00:02:10,618 --> 00:02:13,169
honest just to have this friggin channel

37
00:02:12,628 --> 00:02:16,709
back

38
00:02:13,169 --> 00:02:19,589
and to be able to I can't really explain

39
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:21,689
how many ups and downs I went through in

40
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:23,789
the six weeks with the channel because

41
00:02:21,689 --> 00:02:24,270
YouTube never tells you anything sure

42
00:02:23,789 --> 00:02:26,009
sure

43
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:28,800
they just don't communicate with you so

44
00:02:26,009 --> 00:02:30,870
as your stuff is happening like you know

45
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,489
they would at one point my videos

46
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:34,620
started disappearing like if they would

47
00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:35,849
delete the hacker was deleting videos

48
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,950
and then all of a sudden it was like all

49
00:02:35,849 --> 00:02:40,019
my videos were just were deleted and

50
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:42,149
then and then they were like your

51
00:02:40,019 --> 00:02:45,030
channels terminated and then it was like

52
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:47,370
permanently disabled and I was just like

53
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:50,370
every time it was this sort of insane

54
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:50,969
experience of is this gonna come back

55
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:57,840
together

56
00:02:50,969 --> 00:02:59,250
well did I freeze up bringing everything

57
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:12,599
but yeah he does have a little bit of

58
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:14,879
static charge from time to time but he

59
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:16,919
thought you had the patented already

60
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:29,909
there Sam and he's just got to pay for

61
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:32,009
the patent right I was I was laughing

62
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:33,659
for hours Sam after you said that on

63
00:03:32,009 --> 00:03:52,560
Friday I couldn't stop thinking about

64
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:54,150
that comment 3 in the morning which is

65
00:03:52,560 --> 00:04:19,639
only about a half an hour earlier than

66
00:03:54,150 --> 00:04:19,639
he normally think we lost somebody again

67
00:04:22,788 --> 00:04:25,979
so what were you talking about there

68
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:29,400
with the

69
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:32,660
that hemp CBD blend and chat there well

70
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:39,329
what it basically boils down to is that

71
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:41,700
CBD synthase produces twenty to one

72
00:04:39,329 --> 00:04:45,449
ratio of CBD to dat

73
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:49,409
so anybody who has a high CBD variety

74
00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:54,000
it's impossible to have zero ghe like a

75
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:59,160
third claiming who's claiming this the

76
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:02,639
Texas folks know like really Oh Texas

77
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:05,460
meds correct yes I went to their website

78
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:08,909
and looked at their analysis tonight

79
00:05:05,459 --> 00:05:10,589
since this ain't right hmm well I'll

80
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:13,170
tell you one thing if your spidey sense

81
00:05:10,589 --> 00:05:17,329
is going off there might be something

82
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:22,259
there yeah yeah it's pretty much a given

83
00:05:17,329 --> 00:05:23,490
there's doctor scale down hey everybody

84
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:25,920

86
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:45,389

00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:19,620
oh my god yeah I know honestly I'm

95
00:06:16,019 --> 00:06:22,529
pretty not that I ever took it for

96
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:24,449
granted but I just never thought I

97
00:06:22,529 --> 00:06:26,309
always had to worry like oh maybe

98
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:27,750
YouTube won't like the content one day

99
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:29,009
and they'll take it down but I never

100
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:31,680
really thought I'd get caught with my

101
00:06:29,009 --> 00:06:34,259
pants down and and get sucked into a

102
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:37,500
phishing scam and a phishing scam that

103
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:39,569
was able to happen two-factor

104
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,519
authentication so it wasn't just

105
00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:43,860
that I clicked on a button and it got

106
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:47,248
into my YouTube it went through my

107
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:49,919
YouTube into my gmail authenticated

108
00:06:47,249 --> 00:06:51,479
itself went back to YouTube and then and

109
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:54,628
I was in Whistler at the time on my

110
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:56,128
phone had I been at a computer I think I

111
00:06:54,629 --> 00:06:57,869
could have stopped it because he needed

112
00:06:56,129 --> 00:07:00,990
to go he needed today

113
00:06:57,869 --> 00:07:02,729
the name about three times I think he

114
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:06,240
changed the name three times and on the

115
00:07:02,728 --> 00:07:07,889
third time he removed me as the owner so

116
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,418
each time it would change it would say

117
00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:11,819
you are now the owner of why as

118
00:07:09,418 --> 00:07:14,338
computers you are now the owner of ken

119
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:16,770
lock you are now the owner of and bit

120
00:07:14,338 --> 00:07:19,918
bought by Nance English and that was the

121
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:23,218
worst thing about it but Marcus was that

122
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:28,008
it took all the photos that you have all

123
00:07:23,218 --> 00:07:34,168
your naked photos on your on your your

124
00:07:28,009 --> 00:07:36,809
telephone and email them to me what now

125
00:07:34,168 --> 00:07:38,459
I'm junkie so it's gonna cost you

126
00:07:36,809 --> 00:07:44,338
Bitcoin to get rid of those pictures on

127
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:45,899
the Internet yeah it's funny it's so

128
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:47,968
many people like right now there's a guy

129
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:49,949
in the chat like whoa two-factor that's

130
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:52,259
someone you pissed off bro it's like no

131
00:07:49,949 --> 00:07:55,169
it wasn't a conspiracy like people were

132
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:57,059
like all of it someone bubbleman was god

133
00:07:55,168 --> 00:07:58,680
upset it's like no man it was a phishing

134
00:07:57,059 --> 00:08:00,240
scam that he sends out to tens of

135
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:03,019
thousands of emails and if you google

136
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:06,478
this finance English guy he hacked

137
00:08:03,019 --> 00:08:08,519
hundreds if not a thousand plus YouTube

138
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:10,468
channels they wrote about it in Forbes

139
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:13,228
magazine it was actually a pretty big

140
00:08:10,468 --> 00:08:16,248
thing and I suspect it rocked YouTube

141
00:08:13,228 --> 00:08:18,568
pretty good because from what I know

142
00:08:16,249 --> 00:08:21,930
two-factor authentication is not

143
00:08:18,569 --> 00:08:24,269
supposed to be easily hacked so the hack

144
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:25,889
itself is a value the websites are a

145
00:08:24,269 --> 00:08:27,959
value because you can sell them on the

146
00:08:25,889 --> 00:08:31,918
dark web and I'm not sure if the guy who

147
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:34,049
did the Bitcoin on my website hacked the

148
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:37,139
page or if he was a guy that bought the

149
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:39,028
site on the dark web to do that Bitcoin

150
00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:40,918
scam so these are all the little things

151
00:08:39,028 --> 00:08:42,958
I found out about it it was pretty crazy

152
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:44,789
they're definitely getting smarter and

153
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:47,698
smarter J Henrichs the hackers are

154
00:08:44,789 --> 00:08:50,338
getting smarter and smarter it shows you

155
00:08:47,698 --> 00:08:52,500
how vulnerable our whole system is right

156
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:54,510
I mean we all use

157
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:57,120
you know credit card information and

158
00:08:54,509 --> 00:08:58,889
phones and computers and and even though

159
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,710
if you don't think that you know doing

160
00:08:58,889 --> 00:09:04,379
it on your own phone when you call your

161
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:05,670
credit card number into somebody there's

162
00:09:04,379 --> 00:09:08,399
just somebody on the other end of the

163
00:09:05,669 --> 00:09:10,379
phone typing that information into a

164
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,569
computer anyway yeah you can buy those

165
00:09:10,379 --> 00:09:14,039
numbers on the dark web as well you can

166
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:16,170
buy credit card numbers and know you

167
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:19,049
they get machines with blank cards and

168
00:09:16,169 --> 00:09:22,289
they they punch the the numbers into the

169
00:09:19,049 --> 00:09:25,019
card I know I know and Markus it was

170
00:09:22,289 --> 00:09:28,349
great to hear on your little brief video

171
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:31,110
that you did how helpful YouTube ended

172
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:33,960
up being in the long run right like here

173
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:36,419
we are yeah exactly

174
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:38,070
I mean and I still think there's a good

175
00:09:36,419 --> 00:09:40,409
possibility that one day we're gonna

176
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:42,840
wake up and all the videos are gonna be

177
00:09:40,409 --> 00:09:44,490
back on the channel now for those of you

178
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:47,639
that are all freaking out about that I

179
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:49,529
have a good solid 80 plus percent the

180
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:51,809
ones I didn't recall the videos I

181
00:09:49,529 --> 00:09:55,439
recorded and edited with Johnny B and D

182
00:09:51,809 --> 00:09:58,379
for 20k those are oh I gotta let these

183
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,630
people in one sec those are all saved

184
00:09:58,379 --> 00:10:03,000
now the videos of hashed Church I saved

185
00:10:00,629 --> 00:10:06,059
about 80 percent of them I miss them

186
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,399
like from 130 on to the end of episode

187
00:10:06,059 --> 00:10:11,189
one and then all of this the twos and

188
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:13,799
the threes I don't have but it seems

189
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:15,210
like people who watch the show do have

190
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:16,588
them I've been sent some incredible

191
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:18,480
lists of people that have ripped all

192
00:10:16,589 --> 00:10:19,920
these great shows off the channel so I

193
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,529
would say we're probably sitting in the

194
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:23,250
high 90s for content that was created on

195
00:10:22,529 --> 00:10:25,679
this channel

196
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:27,600
it's it'll end up back on the channel if

197
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:29,309
I have to upload it all again I don't

198
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,009
really care about the views and whatnot

199
00:10:29,309 --> 00:10:34,799
but the content was valuable and it's

200
00:10:32,009 --> 00:10:36,360
amazing how many people have hit me up

201
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:37,740
and been like where's the video we did

202
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,649
together like that's my bread and butter

203
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:43,080
like what happened to that video so

204
00:10:40,649 --> 00:10:45,779
don't direct I'm gonna get them back

205
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:48,540
what you need to do Marcus is post a

206
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:53,220
list of the ones that you don't have

207
00:10:48,539 --> 00:10:57,959
exactly but I pin I bet you get a

208
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:58,800
hundred percent yeah yeah I bet you 99

209
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,720
to a hundred percent

210
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:03,299
wouldn't surprise me at all people love

211
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:06,029
the content and the information so and

212
00:11:03,299 --> 00:11:07,559

215
00:11:09,149 --> 00:11:13,259

216
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:14,879

217
00:11:13,259 --> 00:11:18,179

238
00:12:20,789 --> 00:12:28,769
have problems and it's a struggle just

239
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:29,310
to get on this video and you're guilty

240
00:12:28,769 --> 00:12:33,000
man

241
00:12:29,309 --> 00:12:34,859

242
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:40,710
you want to accuse me of I am guilty

243
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:42,480
guilty of being awesome yes sir thank

244
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:48,600
you me that's what I was waiting for

245
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:50,370
let's do it so Marcus just for a second

246
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:54,600
and all your dealings with the folks at

247
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:59,310
YouTube did the content of the channel

248
00:12:54,600 --> 00:13:01,889
come up just not an issue or I mean at

249
00:12:59,309 --> 00:13:04,469
times it had to at least you know create

250
00:13:01,889 --> 00:13:06,659
a chuckle just about you know what it

251
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:08,850
was about right well I mean these that

252
00:13:06,659 --> 00:13:10,980
YouTube monetized my channel for years

253
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:12,840
they only pulled my monetization out not

254
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:14,940
too long ago which I'm really glad cuz

255
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:17,790
that connected it to a bank account so

256
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:20,400
they had cut it off before I got hacked

257
00:13:17,789 --> 00:13:22,169
dude so and it wasn't a huge

258
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,850
monetization but over the years they

259
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:27,419
just definitely sent me tens of

260
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:30,029
thousands of dollars and so I I was the

261
00:13:27,419 --> 00:13:32,549
only cannabis website YouTube channel

262
00:13:30,029 --> 00:13:35,009
that I know of that was monetized Remo

263
00:13:32,549 --> 00:13:37,169
Johnny no one else got monetized they

264
00:13:35,009 --> 00:13:39,779
monetized mine I have no idea why I

265
00:13:37,169 --> 00:13:42,029
never wanted to rock the boat but in all

266
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:44,220
my dealings with YouTube guess how many

267
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:51,480
times I actually spoke with someone from

268
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:54,389
YouTube zero I didn't text me they

269
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:57,600
didn't email me they are ghosts so what

270
00:13:54,389 --> 00:14:00,210
they do is they send you first of all

271
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,070
you get in touch with Google one and

272
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:03,180
you're like oh my god my channels gone

273
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:04,770
and they're like okay don't worry the

274
00:14:03,179 --> 00:14:06,389
team at YouTube is gonna help you out

275
00:14:04,769 --> 00:14:07,860
and I'm like oh thank you and then I'd

276
00:14:06,389 --> 00:14:09,090
write them back and they may be like

277
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:11,820
this is what you have to do you have to

278
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:14,280
get your account recovered you have to

279
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:16,920
go through and do screenshots of every

280
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:17,850
single email and every time he changed

281
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:19,229
the page and

282
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:21,269
all of that stuff you need to start a

283
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:24,209
thread over on the YouTube Help Center

284
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:27,448
well nobody from YouTube ever answers

285
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:29,818
you on the thread instead random nerds

286
00:14:27,448 --> 00:14:31,769
that work that don't work at YouTube

287
00:14:29,818 --> 00:14:33,299
they just go on the website like you

288
00:14:31,769 --> 00:14:34,860
know when you're on overgrow comm

289
00:14:33,299 --> 00:14:37,409
certain people shine you could ask

290
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:38,970
certain people for ganja growing you

291
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:40,769
could ask certain people for hash making

292
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:43,110
but they didn't own overgrow they didn't

293
00:14:40,769 --> 00:14:44,789
work for overgrow they weren't a part of

294
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:47,610
overgrow they were just random people

295
00:14:44,789 --> 00:14:50,278
that's who helps you at YouTube so I got

296
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:52,919
this guy named at Eric Parker who was a

297
00:14:50,278 --> 00:14:55,259
gold product expert and he came in and

298
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:57,000
said look you gotta recover your account

299
00:14:55,259 --> 00:14:59,278
you got to do all this stuff start the

300
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,698
thread I started the thread and like

301
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:04,049
every two weeks he would be like oh uh

302
00:15:01,698 --> 00:15:06,120
you know sorry we couldn't confirm

303
00:15:04,049 --> 00:15:09,088
hijacking I'm like really like my face

304
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:11,669
and all 1016 videos doesn't like it let

305
00:15:09,089 --> 00:15:13,259
you know that these are my videos no no

306
00:15:11,669 --> 00:15:14,879
we got to do it so I had to do it all

307
00:15:13,259 --> 00:15:17,009
again it took two and a half more weeks

308
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:18,179
and it's super random and you don't

309
00:15:17,009 --> 00:15:19,500
really know what you're doing and you're

310
00:15:18,179 --> 00:15:20,818
jumping through hoops but you're not

311
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:23,458
sure if you're supposed to jump through

312
00:15:20,818 --> 00:15:25,139
this hoop or that hoop and finally I did

313
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:27,679
it again in like two weeks later that

314
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:29,698
Eric Parker guy comes back and he says

315
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:32,188
hijacking has been confirmed

316
00:15:29,698 --> 00:15:34,289
he's puts up a link and he says click on

317
00:15:32,188 --> 00:15:36,870
this link and it'll take you to your

318
00:15:34,289 --> 00:15:39,240
your email page which has now been given

319
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:41,159
that YouTube channel again and start the

320
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:43,860
other confusing thing is that my YouTube

321
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:47,100
channel isn't from my email it's a sub

322
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:49,860
channel that's a brand Channel so my

323
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:52,290
actual email fresh head is at whatever

324
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:54,360
is the YouTube channel but I've never

325
00:15:52,289 --> 00:15:57,059
put content on it it has its own Google

326
00:15:54,360 --> 00:16:00,000
one page but it has no content but under

327
00:15:57,059 --> 00:16:02,338
that page is the bubble man brand bubble

328
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,730
bubble man's world the YouTube page that

329
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:07,470
we all do this on so basically I started

330
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:09,509
another bubble man's brand once they

331
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:11,278
gave me access confirmed hijacking

332
00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:14,100
locked the account that the guy was

333
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:15,720
hacking and what you know I thought they

334
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:18,028
were just gonna migrate everything over

335
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:20,189
but instead it was more convoluted all

336
00:16:18,028 --> 00:16:22,919
the videos got deleted then might then

337
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:25,828
the channel I started was was was

338
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:28,198
disabled for impersonation so I think

339
00:16:25,828 --> 00:16:29,338
people saw the new channel and we're

340
00:16:28,198 --> 00:16:31,229
like oh someone's trying to impersonate

341
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:34,080
bubble man and they reported it about

342
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:40,560
and so they they disabled the new one as

343
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:42,120
well just kept going and Marcus why did

344
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:45,299
they do it were they trying to get

345
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:47,370
bitcoins was that the basic reason well

346
00:16:45,299 --> 00:16:49,139
with what Eric told me was that there's

347
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:52,110
a variety of reasons you can hack these

348
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:54,449
accounts and I got a few emails from

349
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:57,240
people and I'm guessing because my email

350
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:58,530
was attached to the information they put

351
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,570
up on the dark web

352
00:16:58,529 --> 00:17:02,699
but I found out that the website was for

353
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:04,769
sale on the dark web and I was getting

354
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:06,630
offers for ninety thousand a hundred

355
00:17:04,769 --> 00:17:09,779
thousand a hundred and ten thousand

356
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:12,710
dollars to buy the site to buy the

357
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:16,200
hacked YouTube channel chairman also

358
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:18,630
renamed it I think that's what the

359
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:21,269
hacker did I think he sold it and then

360
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:23,220
it became I don't know exactly but in

361
00:17:21,269 --> 00:17:26,369
the end we've got the channel back we

362
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:29,250
get together and I'm just really happy

363
00:17:26,369 --> 00:17:31,139
and don't I'll never sell Bitcoin on

364
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:32,819
this channel so don't you ever see my

365
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:34,110
channel doing anything than what we're

366
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:36,990
doing right now today

367
00:17:34,109 --> 00:17:38,729
rest assured something is wrong there

368
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:41,309
were some people that actually thought I

369
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:45,120
was behind that and was trying to scam

370
00:17:41,309 --> 00:17:47,549
people out of bitcoins not if you did it

371
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:48,719
you would have made bit hash point

372
00:17:47,549 --> 00:17:53,940
exactly

373
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:56,910
come on bitcoins well is it art to

374
00:17:53,940 --> 00:18:01,170
hackers like completely disconnected

375
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:04,769
from finance I mean totally totally yeah

376
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:07,080
- is a big company a really big company

377
00:18:04,769 --> 00:18:08,900
and they're all over the place so I mean

378
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:12,990
they have a million Twitter followers

379
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:15,360
right right so it's likely that that

380
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:16,620
they've been hacked - as well right I

381
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:19,409
mean just the fact that they're using

382
00:18:16,619 --> 00:18:21,899
your name yeah and I don't even know if

383
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:25,650
the videos they showed on my channel

384
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:27,330
were actual Biman's videos or if they

385
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:30,120
were because people like are those the

386
00:18:27,329 --> 00:18:33,199

money right away there's a big building

403
00:19:32,669 --> 00:19:36,479
so much so they convinced my managers

404
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:39,210
actually me two pictures of all of our

405

410
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:56,159
kidding me so it's industry nothing

411
00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:02,460
happened by the way the hackers were

412
00:19:56,159 --> 00:20:04,859
probably in like Mexico I would only say

413
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:08,038
that the hack on me was a phishing scam

414
00:20:04,858 --> 00:20:14,608
I pushed an email I should not have I

415
00:20:08,038 --> 00:20:16,408
don't think it was cannabis focused to

416
00:20:14,608 --> 00:20:19,648
tens of thousands of people and when you

417
00:20:16,409 --> 00:20:22,950
google finance English on YouTube so

418
00:20:19,648 --> 00:20:25,589
many pages come up I think he hacked a

419
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:28,259
lot of pages and so what you're saying

420
00:20:25,589 --> 00:20:30,928
is he just threw out a big guy that

421
00:20:28,259 --> 00:20:32,848
looked for a really stupid pitch yeah

422
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:34,619
and I was the stupidest that was just

423
00:20:32,848 --> 00:20:36,598
like click I had to factor

424
00:20:34,618 --> 00:20:37,918
authentication and on myself when I was

425
00:20:36,598 --> 00:20:40,168
like oh what if he's not gonna get paid

426
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:45,570
like my gmail and my YouTube it's like

427
00:20:40,169 --> 00:20:50,700
oh yeah I did oh yeah he did one of my

428
00:20:45,569 --> 00:20:52,710
other companies the southern hack that's

429
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:54,239
going around the industry where they

430
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:56,160
call and pretend to be the boss they've

431
00:20:54,239 --> 00:20:57,930
even got the picture of the boss on the

432
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,310
little thumbnail and they're like oh

433
00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:00,779
something's gone wrong I need you to

434
00:20:59,309 --> 00:21:02,429
wire me a hundred dollars right away

435

I'll pay you back and one of my

436
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:06,450
companies yeah two or three staff

437
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:07,319
members responded to that they thought

438
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:09,660
it was so real

439
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:13,159
so I'm a lot of cyber training over the

440
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:16,769
last two months to prevent this really

441
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:18,750
because we're trusting yeah yeah I've

442
00:21:16,769 --> 00:21:21,960
noticed small bills coming through my

443
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:23,579
email as well but it's it's weird it's

444
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,829
yeah they're small they're like fifty

445
00:21:23,579 --> 00:21:30,169
seven dollars a hundred dollars a couple

446
00:21:25,829 --> 00:21:32,789
hundred bucks yeah it's it's going on

447
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:36,870
around they've moved on from the

448
00:21:32,789 --> 00:21:39,930
Nigerian princess well I mean I can

449
00:21:36,869 --> 00:21:45,419
remember even a decade ago people would

450
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:49,529
send my company build an invoice for a

451
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:52,259
bill but I had I didn't get any service

452
00:21:49,529 --> 00:21:55,079
I didn't they just sent millions of

453
00:21:52,259 --> 00:22:01,069
bills to everybody hoping a few people

454
00:21:55,079 --> 00:22:03,240
with pacer and some did oh absolutely

455
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:06,059
that's why they keep doing it

456
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:09,990
gullible people everywhere that's

457
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:13,559
completely bonkers so did you talk about

458
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:17,069
hashish well I'd love to it's one of my

459
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:25,440
favorite things who's gonna be the first

460
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:27,509
one to make cured ricin TATP probably

461
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,220
that that's a couple of cards to own

462
00:22:27,509 --> 00:22:31,829
you're gonna a need to have the variety

463
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:34,019
and to be able to grow it but then

464
00:22:31,829 --> 00:22:36,720
you're also going to be needing the

465
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:40,129
techniques and the skills isolate those

466
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:42,660
heads without the help of water to 99.9%

467
00:22:40,130 --> 00:23:00,210
so you've already patent do this right

468
00:22:42,660 --> 00:23:03,750
Sam so how many bitcoins then yeah it

469
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:08,970
really is you know do you now do we

470
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:09,480
believe the other well I've no idea I

471
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:15,929
don't

472
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:17,929
you know how the plant makes it it isn't

473
00:23:15,929 --> 00:23:26,220
a TCPA

474
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:36,090
yes yeah yes so I think it's identifying

475
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:41,370
that we're identifying where the and the

476
00:23:36,089 --> 00:23:44,939
amounts were like you know point zero

477
00:23:41,369 --> 00:23:47,459
zero zero one yes what was the name of

478
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:50,519
the genetic Sam Freddie

479
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:56,700
they didn't tell you the name they it

480
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:58,829
was something like mm M d12 all right it

481
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:00,569
was just a clone number a number letter

482
00:23:58,829 --> 00:24:04,859
cut nomenclature gotcha

483
00:24:00,569 --> 00:24:08,700

gonna have it week or so and so now that

485
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:22,259
B may hit teams to Italy no I I think

486
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:24,450
that there might be other varieties they

487
00:24:22,259 --> 00:24:28,109
just thought of look for it you know now

488
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:29,640
that they know that you know I'm just

489
00:24:28,109 --> 00:24:32,729
saying that now that they know that that

490
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:35,730
compound exists it probably is just part

491
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:37,798
of that unassigned fraction of what's

492
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:39,870
always been in there it's like what's

493
00:24:37,798 --> 00:24:46,139
happening you absolutely could be

494
00:24:39,869 --> 00:24:48,779
correct but nothing I think what they

495
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:53,340
isolated it was from a hip right but I'm

496
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:57,539
not sure and if they isolated it from a

497
00:24:53,339 --> 00:24:59,519
variety but had any THC then the THC no

498
00:24:57,539 --> 00:25:01,769
matter how brutal there was even at

499
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:05,970
church one person would it completely

500
00:25:01,769 --> 00:25:08,819
dominated the TCP nobody you wouldn't

501
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:10,589
even notice my quest is in the chat

502
00:25:08,819 --> 00:25:17,639
right now he said it yeah hemp fiber a

503
00:25:10,589 --> 00:25:19,980
varietal and I would have to ask my

504
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:22,179
quest how he knows that but he doesn't

505
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:26,860
usually open his mouth unless he knows

506
00:25:22,179 --> 00:25:29,740
that he's talking about I read that

507
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:33,819
there's three or four different papers

508
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:43,179
on the group that they isolated also see

509
00:25:33,819 --> 00:25:49,928
be deep be a and THC be a along with th

510
00:25:43,179 --> 00:26:00,639
EP THC P is like sounds too much like

511
00:25:49,929 --> 00:26:03,940
PCP does the THC PA come from the CBG

512
00:26:00,638 --> 00:26:05,558
does that where it starts from no no

513
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:08,320
because it has to have a different

514
00:26:05,558 --> 00:26:11,528
biosynthetic pathway because its tail is

515
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:15,069
longer right the cannabinoids have a c5

516
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:17,048
tail and this has got a c7 tail so it's

517
00:26:15,069 --> 00:26:18,970
just it's just a different product but

518
00:26:17,048 --> 00:26:22,148
it's out of the same biosynthetic

519
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:25,600
pathway so again it should have an acid

520
00:26:22,148 --> 00:26:29,018
group they're just like you know t8 c

521
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:31,538
and t HCV all those have an acid group

522
00:26:29,019 --> 00:26:34,599
right th cv has only got a three carbon

523
00:26:31,538 --> 00:26:37,569
tail right t it sees got the 5 carbon

524
00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:39,368
tail this has got the 7 carbon tail you

525
00:26:37,569 --> 00:26:41,769
know again it be interesting is if

526
00:26:39,368 --> 00:26:44,199
there's a 9 carbon tail those are all

527
00:26:41,769 --> 00:26:48,009
odd numbers of carbons because of the

528
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:50,350
bias of tcp is 3 carbon

529
00:26:48,009 --> 00:26:52,389
yeah that's right that's right because

530
00:26:50,349 --> 00:26:54,278
that biosynthetic pathway sort of puts

531
00:26:52,388 --> 00:26:57,788
things together two carbons at a time

532
00:26:54,278 --> 00:27:00,819
yeah so it's does this mean there's

533
00:26:57,788 --> 00:27:06,099
probably a third then endocannabinoid

534
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:08,439
receptor for this I think that again I

535
00:27:06,099 --> 00:27:10,808
don't have any data to support this but

536
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:13,860
I I think that this is just again part

537
00:27:10,808 --> 00:27:16,868
of that other unknown fraction of

538
00:27:13,859 --> 00:27:20,079
cannabinoids that we do extract that's

539
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:24,278
just part of that you know again if you

540
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:27,058
look at a really well made live resin

541
00:27:24,278 --> 00:27:30,730
extract it'll be something like 80%

542
00:27:27,058 --> 00:27:35,589
cannabinoids you know 10% terpenes maybe

543
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:37,990
12% terpenes so that other 7% of stuff

544
00:27:35,589 --> 00:27:43,509
in there I think that compounds like

545
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:54,099
this and the flavonoids and so cb-one

546
00:27:43,509 --> 00:27:55,298
antagonist then they said it's gets you

547
00:27:54,099 --> 00:28:03,548
43

548
00:27:55,298 --> 00:28:05,648
higher I would I would put that in a

549
00:28:03,548 --> 00:28:07,658
sort of grain of salt you know kind of

550
00:28:05,648 --> 00:28:09,939
thing because when you model something

551
00:28:07,659 --> 00:28:12,129
on a computer yeah what they're doing is

552
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:14,798
they're sort of looking at there's a

553
00:28:12,128 --> 00:28:17,168
crystal structure known of the receptor

554
00:28:14,798 --> 00:28:19,089
site so that's sort of like the the lock

555
00:28:17,169 --> 00:28:21,460
and they're sort of modeling the key

556
00:28:19,089 --> 00:28:25,329
fitting in the lock and yeah sometimes

557
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:27,610
that's really predictive of how potent

558
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:30,519
it's gonna be but if that's truly the

559
00:28:27,609 --> 00:28:32,439
case we wouldn't have human disease

560
00:28:30,519 --> 00:28:34,599
today because all disease would be

561
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:35,499
solved because that methods been around

562
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:38,230
for thirty years

563
00:28:35,499 --> 00:28:41,288
it's called rational drug design and so

564
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:45,610
you can perform rational drug design but

565
00:28:41,288 --> 00:28:48,429
drug delivery and metabolism and all

566
00:28:45,609 --> 00:28:51,339
kinds of other things complicates you

567
00:28:48,429 --> 00:28:53,619
know making you know just lock and key

568
00:28:51,339 --> 00:28:59,548
fits to say look that's going to be 30

569
00:28:53,618 --> 00:29:01,808
times more potent I think yeah I agree

570
00:28:59,548 --> 00:29:04,558
yeah I think I'll just finish by just

571
00:29:01,808 --> 00:29:09,158
saying that I think what it says is that

572
00:29:04,558 --> 00:29:12,368
the hydrophobic promiscuity of that area

573
00:29:09,159 --> 00:29:15,190
of the receptor is rich for making

574
00:29:12,368 --> 00:29:18,480
analogues like that and if you know have

575
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:21,249
annoyed analogues like the dimethyl

576
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:23,980
petal analogues that's where they put

577
00:29:21,249 --> 00:29:25,778
two methyl groups adjacent to the

578
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:29,589
benzene ring and these were a series of

579
00:29:25,778 --> 00:29:31,509
analogs that were made they have jwh

580
00:29:29,589 --> 00:29:34,209
numbers so i don't know if that means

581
00:29:31,509 --> 00:29:37,808
they remain at Johns Hopkins or whatever

582
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:41,259
we know that's John hookman John

583
00:29:37,808 --> 00:29:44,558
Hoffmann okay right thank you Sam yes so

584
00:29:41,259 --> 00:29:46,829
those compounds there again sort of

585
00:29:44,558 --> 00:29:50,609
probe the notion that

586
00:29:46,829 --> 00:29:55,019
and of the receptor is kind of got room

587
00:29:50,609 --> 00:29:57,028
that can accommodate larger groups and

588
00:29:55,019 --> 00:29:59,579
you could sort of branch out and make

589
00:29:57,028 --> 00:30:02,009
different analogues of the naturally

590
00:29:59,579 --> 00:30:04,589
occurring compounds that could basically

591
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:08,129
make a tighter fit in the receptor and

592
00:30:04,589 --> 00:30:09,808
perhaps enhance its potency but

593
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:13,669
ultimately either way you could make it

594
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:16,589
stronger or weaker dependent ring yes

595
00:30:13,669 --> 00:30:19,460
Sam if I remember correctly didn't that

596
00:30:16,589 --> 00:30:23,808
group also show some efficacy in mice

597
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:27,120
yeah absolutely binding in rapper age

598
00:30:23,808 --> 00:30:29,519
monitors right yeah so that's kind of

599
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:32,759
cool I mean you know I think what it

600
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:35,099
says is that again it's probing the

601
00:30:32,759 --> 00:30:37,879
notion of you know like what Rousseau

602
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:37,879
and Michelle

603
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:45,750
you

604
00:30:53,109 --> 00:30:59,589
then THCA and you did a dad with that

605
00:30:55,808 --> 00:31:01,558
versus a 60% THC a with the right mix of

606
00:30:59,589 --> 00:31:05,470
Terps and other compounds in there

607
00:31:01,558 --> 00:31:07,990
there's just a complete difference in

608
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:10,509
how you feel when you consume those

609
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:13,900
extracts which I would say subjectively

610
00:31:10,509 --> 00:31:17,140
almost twice as strong yeah they

611
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:18,490
wonderful ensemble effect yeah so I mean

612
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:21,160
isn't that what the cannabis plant

613
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:28,048
teaches us which now we have to teach

614
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:28,048
the FDA that look it's not just CBD it's

615
00:31:33,548 --> 00:31:35,609
you

616
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:51,110
matters to the FDA actually just

617
00:31:45,859 --> 00:31:51,109
released a statement on Thursday

618
00:31:57,369 --> 00:31:59,429
you

619
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:15,230
they really encouraged interested

620
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:17,240
parties to develop safety data to show

621
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:21,170
that it's okay so they're basically

622
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:22,759
saying that you know they're asking for

623
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:26,320
data they're looking for the data

624
00:32:22,759 --> 00:32:26,319
they're looking for data to show that

625
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:34,279
you

626
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:50,000
there's a lot of side effects of

627
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:52,519
meloxicam meloxicam effects a huge swath

628
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:56,150
of the population well anyway the impact

629
00:32:52,519 --> 00:33:00,470
of a CBD medication that she was taking

630
00:32:56,150 --> 00:33:03,110
they think led to this toxic reaction of

631
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:05,779
the liver which actually led to her

632
00:33:03,109 --> 00:33:06,889
death they're not saying that CBD caused

633
00:33:05,779 --> 00:33:10,339
the death

634
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:14,570
but CBDs impact on the liver metabolism

635
00:33:10,339 --> 00:33:17,629
of a pretty toxic and known drug to have

636
00:33:14,569 --> 00:33:21,439
several side effects then basically led

637
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:23,000
to her led to her passing but it's like

638
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:26,690
one of those things again where I think

639
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:29,599
the FDA has just got to try to get their

640
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:31,400
arms around exactly how to regulate this

641
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:34,490
and the right way to make sure that

642
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:38,240
they're operating in an area that

643
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:41,750
certainly puts the safety of people

644
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:44,630
first but certainly works with the

645
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:47,269
industry to develop safety data to show

646
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:55,570
that you know taking these things aren't

647
00:33:47,269 --> 00:33:55,569
going to lead to what kind of medication

648
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:03,309
you

649
00:34:07,549 --> 00:34:14,210
is anytime someone asks me for some

650
00:34:10,668 --> 00:34:16,250
guidance on using CBD I always tell them

651
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:18,168
if they're on any pharmaceutical drugs

652
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:21,530
to talk to the doctor that prescribed

653
00:34:18,168 --> 00:34:22,849
those drugs and make sure that there's

654
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:25,850
not going to be an interaction there

655
00:34:22,849 --> 00:34:27,918
that could be problematic and there's

656
00:34:25,849 --> 00:34:29,569
two things two reasons to do that one is

657
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:31,549
the doctors need to know more about what

658
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:32,780
their patients are doing and the effects

659
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:36,050
that cannabis are having on their

660
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:38,060
treatment options and two to avoid the

661
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:40,340
exact scenario that Mark just described

662
00:34:38,059 --> 00:34:43,190
where someone's pharmaceutically

663
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:45,740
prescribed drug accumulates in the blood

664
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:49,220
to the point where it can kill them I

665
00:34:45,739 --> 00:34:51,799
first saw this with seizures one of the

666
00:34:49,219 --> 00:34:54,039
folks I was a young person I was helping

667
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:56,740
with was on some other medications and

668
00:34:54,039 --> 00:34:59,840
their seizures actually got worse and

669
00:34:56,739 --> 00:35:02,389
thankfully the parents had the foresight

670
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:04,700
if you will to have that child's blood

671
00:35:02,389 --> 00:35:06,859
tested and yes they had a really high

672
00:35:04,699 --> 00:35:12,739
concentration of one of their prescribed

673
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:14,660
drugs in their bloodstream you know I

674
00:35:12,739 --> 00:35:18,500
mean a lot of patients are on you know

675
00:35:14,659 --> 00:35:20,179
diabetes medications blood pressure

676
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:21,920
medications I mean these are medications

677
00:35:20,179 --> 00:35:23,710
that are helping them stay alive that

678
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:26,389
doesn't mean that they can't take

679
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:30,260
cannabinoids and and supplement their

680
00:35:26,389 --> 00:35:32,599
health by supplementing with

681
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:37,090
cannabinoids especially again speaking

682
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:40,250
to Ethan Russo's you know theory of

683
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:42,670
endocannabinoid deficiency sort of you

684
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:44,960
picture that the body's own

685
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:46,849
pharmaceutical company is the end of

686
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:49,940
cannabinoid system and it needs to be

687
00:35:46,849 --> 00:35:53,150
nurtured in such a way that your body

688
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:55,099
can fight off all of these viruses and

689
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:57,740
diseases and whatnot and you don't have

690
00:35:55,099 --> 00:35:59,599
to take things like meloxicam

691
00:35:57,739 --> 00:36:01,849
I forget exactly what she was taking

692
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:06,769
meloxicam for but I know that it's a

693
00:36:01,849 --> 00:36:09,589
pretty nasty drug it's one of those

694
00:36:06,769 --> 00:36:12,670
NSAIDs non-steroidal anti-inflammatory

695
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:15,650
agents but I think in the GW Pharma

696
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:18,200
clinical trials this liver toxicity

697
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:20,269
thing was observed again in patients

698
00:36:18,199 --> 00:36:20,989
that were on you know any number of

699
00:36:20,269 --> 00:36:24,019
medication

700
00:36:20,989 --> 00:36:25,899
whether it's for diabetes or for blood

701
00:36:24,019 --> 00:36:28,250
pressure but you know if they have these

702
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:30,860
existing conditions exactly what you're

703
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:33,679
saying wait is that you know you can't

704
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:36,650
not make people aware of this because

705
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:38,359
they have to understand the impact of

706
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:41,150
what they're taking into their body and

707
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:44,090
their own bodies genetics and their

708
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:45,889
ability to you know detoxify themselves

709
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:49,309
I do believe cannabinoids do have a

710
00:36:45,889 --> 00:36:51,549
peripheral effect that certainly are

711
00:36:49,309 --> 00:36:54,699
going to interact with any other

712
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:59,470
pharmaceuticals that you're taking and

713
00:36:54,699 --> 00:37:05,029
you know take it with caution I guess

714
00:36:59,469 --> 00:37:07,759
what is grapefruit if you drink

715
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:11,450
grapefruit with or eat grapefruit it can

716
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:19,240
really [ __ ] with some medications by the

717
00:37:11,449 --> 00:37:22,460
wife would stay with that particular

718
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:23,929
yeah you if your pharmaceutical one of

719
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:25,940
the other things you can do for someone

720
00:37:23,929 --> 00:37:29,079
who's on pharmaceutical drugs is have

721
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:31,909
them look at the sheet that describes

722
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:33,710
potential side effects and all of that

723
00:37:31,909 --> 00:37:36,230
the boilerplate that comes with every

724
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:37,940
medication if it says somewhere on there

725
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:40,039
do not take this medication with

726
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:42,769
grapefruit juice it likely has an

727
00:37:40,039 --> 00:37:47,480
interaction with CTE I wonder if it's

728
00:37:42,769 --> 00:37:50,719
the the grapefruit terpenes like

729
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:55,400
nuketown new ketone is a is a is a

730
00:37:50,719 --> 00:37:59,809
sesqui terpenoid that's sort of like the

731
00:37:55,400 --> 00:38:01,849
essential oil component of of grapefruit

732
00:37:59,809 --> 00:38:04,789
that's got that real grapefruit smell I

733
00:38:01,849 --> 00:38:08,449
think it occurs in cannabis nuketown and

734
00:38:04,789 --> 00:38:12,500
that's it's similar to a few different

735
00:38:08,449 --> 00:38:14,029
other citrus type of terpenes but i

736
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:16,369
wonder if those are the terpenes that

737
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:19,730
actually have some effect or if it's

738
00:38:16,369 --> 00:38:22,190
just general lead the acidity you know

739
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:27,679
because there is a lot of you know

740
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:33,889
citrate money that speeds up or breaks

741
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:34,809
down right that's the core problem my

742
00:38:33,889 --> 00:38:37,869
wife was having

743
00:38:34,809 --> 00:38:40,090
and she her doctor never told her that

744
00:38:37,869 --> 00:38:42,159
this medication should not be take with

745
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:50,160
greater she's too dirty grapefruit juice

746
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:50,159
every morning till she find out right

747
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:56,530
damn I missed these conversations Thank

748
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:58,509
You Marcus yeah just thinking results in

749
00:38:56,530 --> 00:38:59,590
the hospital taking all the Pharma stuff

750
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:01,210
like that I used to eat a lot of

751
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:03,700
grapefruits and stuff like that I'm just

752
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:05,769
I'm listening to all this and trying to

753
00:39:03,699 --> 00:39:08,799
kind of go back in the memory of when I

754
00:39:05,769 --> 00:39:10,179
was on all the pharma and and trying to

755
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:13,420
take all the cannabinoids trying to get

756
00:39:10,179 --> 00:39:15,940
off all of that interesting it's yeah

757
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:18,190
trying to really think about that would

758
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:19,809
be making you nauseous sick stuff like

759
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:29,710
that I mean I'm trying to think of the

760
00:39:19,809 --> 00:39:34,360
side effects oh I was I was muted I was

761
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:38,740
talking and it was muted but yeah I was

762
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:40,030
gonna tell you but I was muted too well

763
00:39:38,739 --> 00:39:42,479
thank you for muting when you're not

764
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:42,480
talking

765
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:52,180
it's courtesy you know the THC P thing

766
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:53,470
we were talking about a few minutes ago

767
00:39:52,179 --> 00:39:57,789
that's something that I've been thinking

768
00:39:53,469 --> 00:39:59,259
a lot about because working off the

769
00:39:57,789 --> 00:40:01,480
analytical results we've had for years

770
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:04,960
where we mostly just looked at THC and

771
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:09,219
THC CBD and a few other of the

772
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:11,139
cannabinoids I'm wondering I always went

773
00:40:09,219 --> 00:40:14,199
with the assumption that the differences

774
00:40:11,139 --> 00:40:16,900
we saw in high THC varieties had to do

775
00:40:14,199 --> 00:40:19,389
with the terpenes the differences in the

776
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:23,230
response like some some THC varieties

777
00:40:19,389 --> 00:40:25,239
you want to go dancing or go finish that

778
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:27,280
fence you were building or write a song

779
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:29,259
and others it's like you're locked into

780
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:31,360
the couch and you can't even muster

781
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:32,590
enough energy to reach over and grab the

782
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:35,349
remote so you don't have to watch a

783
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:39,039
commercial and and yet the cannabinoids

784
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:40,539
are pretty much similar and I I really

785
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:42,550
think maybe that that couch lock

786
00:40:40,539 --> 00:40:45,909
phenomenon probably those cultivars

787
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:47,730
likely have some THC P in them because

788
00:40:45,909 --> 00:40:52,049
we don't have and

789
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:55,500
see the notes found are so small that

790
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:59,160
even if it was there you wouldn't feel

791
00:40:55,500 --> 00:41:02,699
it really I mean it's like 150 amount of

792
00:40:59,159 --> 00:41:04,799
THC and that was my next question and in

793
00:41:02,699 --> 00:41:07,349
terms of the cultivars that they they

794
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:09,030
they grab this from are these really

795
00:41:07,349 --> 00:41:19,529
recessive traits that we're really

796
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:25,560
looking at guys and are they you can't

797
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:30,990
tell the traitors what okay let's get

798
00:41:25,559 --> 00:41:32,159
info so because it came from a fiber you

799
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:34,739
know because he came from a fiber plant

800
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:36,569
it leads me to kind of look at it in the

801
00:41:34,739 --> 00:41:40,289
way that the plant could you know

802
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:42,990
shifted its energy and it focused on

803
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:44,759
these these recessive traits because

804
00:41:42,989 --> 00:41:48,500
let's face it fibers

805
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:58,980
you know hemp is you know predominantly

806
00:41:48,500 --> 00:42:01,199
non cannabinoid fokin here forward well

807
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:07,079
again that's what I really that's thank

808
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:10,108
you for from acid right which have a c5

809
00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:12,809
tail this has got a two extra carbon so

810
00:42:10,108 --> 00:42:15,779
it's just another compound but whatever

811
00:42:12,809 --> 00:42:20,009
the all taluk acid plus 2 carbon trivial

812
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:22,380
name for that is this is what it is it's

813
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:23,490
being terminated in the same way and

814
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:25,530
they build the other side of the

815
00:42:23,489 --> 00:42:29,909
molecule in the same way this thing just

816
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:31,500
has this p7 tail terminated yeah they

817
00:42:29,909 --> 00:42:34,589
could probably they'll be able to do

818
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:36,119
this in yeast they'll be able to pull

819
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:38,039
this off in yeast because they already

820
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:42,780
have their rest of that pathway already

821
00:42:38,039 --> 00:42:47,519
clone I'm sticking with flour thank you

822
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:54,230
thank you let's just telling you what

823
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:58,730
the rest of the world is gonna do no

824
00:42:54,230 --> 00:43:00,840
bakers couldn't do without Easter

825
00:42:58,730 --> 00:43:01,500
depends on what kind of baking you're

826
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:03,390
doing

827
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:06,869
if you're waking baking you can do it

828
00:43:03,389 --> 00:43:09,389
without yeast all day long bro depends

829
00:43:06,869 --> 00:43:10,230
on if you need to rise and shine this is

830
00:43:09,389 --> 00:43:12,329
true this is true

831
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:16,349
rise and shine on the wake and bake time

832
00:43:12,329 --> 00:43:23,039
to make the donuts paper shred was

833
00:43:16,349 --> 00:43:27,269
always extra sourdough and that's I'm to

834
00:43:23,039 --> 00:43:30,690
be until there yeah that's terrible

835
00:43:27,269 --> 00:43:32,639
bread terrible read it is terrible but

836
00:43:30,690 --> 00:43:33,840
the bread is good no there's a lot of

837
00:43:32,639 --> 00:43:36,509
biology to that

838
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:40,680
I'll take New Orleans French bread over

839
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:43,970
anything any day as we're sitting here

840
00:43:40,679 --> 00:43:45,989
talking I'm looking at I got some

841
00:43:43,969 --> 00:43:48,118
profiles from the strain called many

842
00:43:45,989 --> 00:43:53,069
likes that I did back in the days and

843
00:43:48,119 --> 00:43:56,640
it's a total tripling 2.1 3% bein

844
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:59,490
immersing 0.51 leaning point 2 9 and

845
00:43:56,639 --> 00:44:01,769
beta carolyn point 2 8 what's

846
00:43:59,489 --> 00:44:06,449
interesting about this one is its TC is

847
00:44:01,769 --> 00:44:08,159
ninety point 7 5 cv DG is 1.8 delta 9 TC

848
00:44:06,449 --> 00:44:12,059
is one point six five but this one has

849
00:44:08,159 --> 00:44:14,940
Tec Bao point one five in CBD a at point

850
00:44:12,059 --> 00:44:18,088
one for Johnny if you add up all the

851
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:21,480
numbers there yeah what's left what's

852
00:44:18,088 --> 00:44:23,429
what's not known in that extract if you

853
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:26,159
add up all those numbers what is the

854
00:44:23,429 --> 00:44:28,500
what is the number come up to ninety

855
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:31,440
four point four nine percent okay so

856
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:41,309
there's still like five point something

857
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:52,108
percent unknown compounds like CBC or CB

858
00:44:41,309 --> 00:44:55,980
CB 48 CP right gtp a great exactly so

859
00:44:52,108 --> 00:44:59,000
that could be part of what that 5% is

860
00:44:55,980 --> 00:45:01,920
probably just a really small fraction

861
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:04,500
but again it's 30 to 60 times stronger

862
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:10,559
than THC so I I do think even at really

863
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:13,710
small amounts I thought I saw in the

864
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:14,940
paper okay well I read through the

865
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:17,130
expert

866
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:21,720
that's what I read the the science

867
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:23,099
papers not that it's no I did again I've

868
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:25,578
been reading a lot of papers recently

869
00:45:23,099 --> 00:45:29,970
and oh yeah I read this thirty as well

870
00:45:25,579 --> 00:45:34,730
that's what it appeared is so do we

871
00:45:29,969 --> 00:45:34,730
really need sorry

872
00:45:36,050 --> 00:45:42,210
that's speculation it's everybody

873
00:45:40,318 --> 00:45:44,608
thought pure tea tea would be the

874
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:47,730
strongest thing you could smoke but like

875
00:45:44,608 --> 00:45:52,108
Mark said earlier you know it's not if

876
00:45:47,730 --> 00:45:53,639
you get half a 50 percent THC and Spike

877
00:45:52,108 --> 00:45:56,460
it with the right terpenes

878
00:45:53,639 --> 00:45:59,639
if it's stronger yeah I agree with Wade

879
00:45:56,460 --> 00:46:03,059
it has to the THC PA must exist at such

880
00:45:59,639 --> 00:46:05,879
a very small finite manufacturing on the

881
00:46:03,059 --> 00:46:07,828
plant because if it had been in a larger

882
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:18,720
form we would have way discovered it by

883
00:46:07,829 --> 00:46:22,140
now and Padawan yeah I wanted to ask

884
00:46:18,719 --> 00:46:24,449
them so do you think that now that we

885
00:46:22,139 --> 00:46:26,519
kind of have a somewhat of a glimpse

886
00:46:24,449 --> 00:46:28,108
into the into the light so to speak do

887
00:46:26,519 --> 00:46:31,679
you think we can go back and look at

888
00:46:28,108 --> 00:46:33,179
other tests results and be able to kind

889
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:45,230
of navigate those test results to

890
00:46:33,179 --> 00:46:47,730
identify these same spikes I think yeah

891
00:46:45,230 --> 00:46:51,690
I mean I think that like the question

892
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:54,119
you're asking is is th CP has it been

893
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:57,929
there all along right is that like Zoe

894
00:46:54,119 --> 00:47:01,980
rest yeah essentially yes so so would be

895
00:46:57,929 --> 00:47:05,250
cool if see the the cool thing about

896
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:07,260
this paper well the one good thing is

897
00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:08,818
like they're like eleven people on the

898
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:11,099
paper right so that's what we call a

899
00:47:08,818 --> 00:47:13,019
football team paper right when you put

900
00:47:11,099 --> 00:47:15,359
eleven people on a project you can get

901
00:47:13,019 --> 00:47:18,059
[ __ ] done and they had the Italian

902
00:47:15,358 --> 00:47:19,199
military you know right now again I

903
00:47:18,059 --> 00:47:23,818
don't know if it's just a coincidence

904
00:47:19,199 --> 00:47:26,328
with Italy's the only country outside of

905
00:47:23,818 --> 00:47:27,900
China that's got the highest rate of

906
00:47:26,329 --> 00:47:29,309
coronavirus

907
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:32,608
faction I don't know if they're related

908
00:47:29,309 --> 00:47:39,500
they're probably not doctor Skelton do

909
00:47:32,608 --> 00:47:43,230
you think that the th CPA and it's I

910
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:44,670
lost my translate well the the finish my

911
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:46,710
train of thought and the years we'll

912
00:47:44,670 --> 00:47:50,099
come back Etienne the cool thing is that

913
00:47:46,710 --> 00:47:53,429
so not only did they identify it but

914
00:47:50,099 --> 00:47:56,460
then they also made it synthetically to

915
00:47:53,429 --> 00:47:58,909
create a standard so that way they can

916
00:47:56,460 --> 00:48:00,750
you know then if they made it

917
00:47:58,909 --> 00:48:03,318
synthetically they know what they

918
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:06,630
started with and you can't just you know

919
00:48:03,318 --> 00:48:08,519
remove two carbons from that tail or add

920
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:11,640
two carbons so they started with a

921
00:48:08,519 --> 00:48:14,519
starting material not all of it all but

922
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:17,038
whatever the two carbon homologue about

923
00:48:14,519 --> 00:48:20,630
all of tallest somebody will find at the

924
00:48:17,039 --> 00:48:23,789
chat i bet and that compound there they

925
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:25,940
reacted to basically put on the other

926
00:48:23,789 --> 00:48:29,819
part of the molecule so they made it

927
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:33,510
synthetically so they can identify it in

928
00:48:29,818 --> 00:48:36,420
the mixture of cannabis now this a long

929
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:39,750
way of answering the question so once we

930
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:44,088
have a synthetic source of it hopefully

931
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:49,170
people will find value in making the

932
00:48:44,088 --> 00:48:51,509
material pure as an analytical standard

933
00:48:49,170 --> 00:48:54,450
so those analytical standards cost a

934
00:48:51,510 --> 00:48:57,480
whole lot of money it's like 500 bucks

935
00:48:54,449 --> 00:49:00,269
for like a one made per mill solution

936
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:02,278
it's only like one milliliter yeah so

937
00:49:00,269 --> 00:49:04,769
you're only getting this small little

938
00:49:02,278 --> 00:49:06,690
you know dilute sample and material and

939
00:49:04,769 --> 00:49:09,298
it's got to be dilute to be you know

940
00:49:06,690 --> 00:49:11,579
harmonious with da you know what they

941
00:49:09,298 --> 00:49:14,449
allow being purchased and sent to the

942
00:49:11,579 --> 00:49:18,539
mail but those analytical standards are

943
00:49:14,449 --> 00:49:21,419
absolutely required to then go back and

944
00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:24,329
look at all the you know extracts and

945
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:25,889
stuff and see if those cannabinoids are

946
00:49:24,329 --> 00:49:28,440
in there and and maybe they're in there

947
00:49:25,889 --> 00:49:32,038
maybe maybe they're not you know I mean

948
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:34,829
I think that maybe you know if there

949
00:49:32,039 --> 00:49:38,130
were analytical standards for them now

950
00:49:34,829 --> 00:49:40,410
we can assign what those bumps and the

951
00:49:38,130 --> 00:49:41,680
baseline were that add up to that

952
00:49:40,409 --> 00:49:44,828
collective

953
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:47,739
you know 5% of unknowns that's in

954
00:49:44,829 --> 00:49:51,190
johnny's hash right does that make sense

955
00:49:47,739 --> 00:49:53,949
am I making sense you guys Neverland man

956
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:57,309
I have my aunt and my question was

957
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:59,259
regarding if THC of course causes

958
00:49:57,309 --> 00:50:04,630
paranoia especially in high dosages that

959
00:49:59,259 --> 00:50:07,358
it can what will th CPA do THC causes

960
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:10,298
paranoia I think the laws against THC

961
00:50:07,358 --> 00:50:14,288
cause paranoia that's what I think I

962
00:50:10,298 --> 00:50:19,420
think those people laws that cause

963
00:50:14,289 --> 00:50:20,259
paranoia some people smoke THC get way

964
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:21,909
too high

965
00:50:20,259 --> 00:50:23,380
and think you're gonna be like that

966
00:50:21,909 --> 00:50:26,858
tomorrow when they have to go to work

967
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:29,289
yeah right I mean do you guys remember

968
00:50:26,858 --> 00:50:31,268
michelin's video like when they made the

969
00:50:29,289 --> 00:50:33,069
cake and they gave it out to people and

970
00:50:31,268 --> 00:50:35,139
some people really enjoyed it some

971
00:50:33,068 --> 00:50:37,538
people didn't stop talking just like

972
00:50:35,139 --> 00:50:39,730
when people get high and one person got

973
00:50:37,539 --> 00:50:42,249
really paranoid they got really upset

974
00:50:39,730 --> 00:50:44,440
and thought that people were looking at

975
00:50:42,248 --> 00:50:48,009
her differently or I don't know I mean

976
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:51,429
yeah that happens to some people in the

977
00:50:48,009 --> 00:50:53,289
population I think like a lot of

978
00:50:51,429 --> 00:50:55,449
different biological triggers in the

979
00:50:53,289 --> 00:50:57,099
body things are like biphasic and

980
00:50:55,449 --> 00:50:59,230
they're switches and I've always said

981
00:50:57,099 --> 00:51:01,509
that sometimes you know when you're in

982
00:50:59,230 --> 00:51:03,309
the house you need to have enough lights

983
00:51:01,509 --> 00:51:05,889
on in a house so you can see you don't

984
00:51:03,309 --> 00:51:09,489
have to have all the lights on all the

985
00:51:05,889 --> 00:51:11,139
time and so like in your body you know I

986
00:51:09,489 --> 00:51:14,318
think that's the way your receptors work

987
00:51:11,139 --> 00:51:17,259
is that you have to sort of titrate

988
00:51:14,318 --> 00:51:19,778
yourself where you are to be you know

989
00:51:17,259 --> 00:51:22,960
who you can be and and how you can be

990
00:51:19,778 --> 00:51:26,289
sort of a level homeostasis with your

991
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:28,088
body is amazing like when I go and I

992
00:51:26,289 --> 00:51:29,890
meet see with my physician and he goes

993
00:51:28,088 --> 00:51:32,798
oh yeah we're not we don't have you on

994
00:51:29,889 --> 00:51:34,868
drugs it's like nothing they're needed

995
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:37,210
right if you're at home you know stasis

996
00:51:34,869 --> 00:51:40,809
you don't need blood pressure medication

997
00:51:37,210 --> 00:51:43,150
or the statins or the other you know

998
00:51:40,809 --> 00:51:45,069
made of drugs that the pharmaceutical

999
00:51:43,150 --> 00:51:47,650
companies want to feed somebody in my

1000
00:51:45,068 --> 00:51:51,909
demographic you know if I breathe

1001
00:51:47,650 --> 00:51:55,519
variety that's ten percent THC E but it

1002
00:51:51,909 --> 00:51:59,779
should be in theory

1003
00:51:55,519 --> 00:52:06,019
it should be you know I'm stronger than

1004
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:14,260
any cannabis and yes legal because it is

1005
00:52:06,019 --> 00:52:16,280
not th see it's G HCP okay isn't Sam

1006
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:19,070
do you even know what kind of strains

1007
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:24,070
are high in THC PA only looking like

1008
00:52:19,070 --> 00:52:24,070
pushes like absolutely like I said oh

1009
00:52:30,369 --> 00:52:35,179
yeah the walls I can't wait to see it

1010
00:52:33,139 --> 00:52:36,980
all see you all go down and and see how

1011
00:52:35,179 --> 00:52:41,210
this all progresses it's it's

1012
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:43,130
fascinating me it's as you know someone

1013
00:52:41,210 --> 00:52:46,670
has been spent their life at the plant

1014
00:52:43,130 --> 00:52:48,050
and been watching your works and I you

1015
00:52:46,670 --> 00:52:49,789
know it gets me really excited to know

1016
00:52:48,050 --> 00:52:52,100
that there's there's so much that we

1017
00:52:49,789 --> 00:52:54,230
don't know and as much as we've we've

1018
00:52:52,099 --> 00:52:55,849
found out you know over the years

1019
00:52:54,230 --> 00:52:58,639
there's just a plethora of things that

1020
00:52:55,849 --> 00:53:00,860
are exciting to look into this is a

1021
00:52:58,639 --> 00:53:03,199
highlight for for I think a lot of

1022
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:05,480
people right now it's a frontier it's a

1023
00:53:03,199 --> 00:53:06,799
real frontier that's what we've said is

1024
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:09,050
that you know we have already known

1025
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:10,970
there's been and still needs to be you

1026
00:53:09,050 --> 00:53:12,650
know decades and even a hundred years

1027
00:53:10,969 --> 00:53:13,939
worth of research they're just studies

1028
00:53:12,650 --> 00:53:17,539
that we have we've already missed

1029
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:19,190
70-plus years so we've already seen what

1030
00:53:17,539 --> 00:53:21,529
we've known anecdotally and here we are

1031
00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:23,809
still through the science that we've

1032
00:53:21,530 --> 00:53:24,410
only started you know in the last few

1033
00:53:23,809 --> 00:53:26,659
decades

1034
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:28,159
what will we actually find it's still

1035
00:53:26,659 --> 00:53:30,619
very exciting in to those who are

1036
00:53:28,159 --> 00:53:32,719
watching it's I'd be very excited to

1037
00:53:30,619 --> 00:53:35,210
jump into science classes and learn that

1038
00:53:32,719 --> 00:53:37,099
stuff so that when I graduate I could

1039
00:53:35,210 --> 00:53:39,650
start going into this field and start

1040
00:53:37,099 --> 00:53:43,130
discovering the actual effects on the

1041
00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:44,990
human receptor of THC PA etc so I mean

1042
00:53:43,130 --> 00:53:49,010
there's a whole other frontier right

1043
00:53:44,989 --> 00:53:51,679
there just on research I got another one

1044
00:53:49,010 --> 00:53:53,450
he gets me a lot higher I filled the

1045
00:53:51,679 --> 00:53:55,009
tuned cultural spectrum and it's told

1046
00:53:53,449 --> 00:53:55,809
cannabinoids are ninety two point eight

1047
00:53:55,010 --> 00:53:58,160
three

1048
00:53:55,809 --> 00:54:00,679
so as I'm sitting there thinking in both

1049
00:53:58,159 --> 00:54:03,440
I don't want any of ya that's why I so

1050
00:54:00,679 --> 00:54:07,039
it was it pushes this curious its yeah

1051
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:08,840
it's really let me just yeah there was

1052
00:54:07,039 --> 00:54:10,880
another new cannabinoid recently

1053
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:16,970
discovered you guys see that what was

1054
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:20,570
that can'tcan't above but not more yeah

1055
00:54:16,969 --> 00:54:21,379
I saw can't kick combative in own or

1056
00:54:20,570 --> 00:54:23,930
something like that

1057
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:27,349
yes that's it they actually discovered

1058
00:54:23,929 --> 00:54:30,349
it several years ago I think it is

1059
00:54:27,349 --> 00:54:32,929
no smiling with chimera in this because

1060
00:54:30,349 --> 00:54:36,559
I think chimera knows the group in Italy

1061
00:54:32,929 --> 00:54:38,750
that that discovered it and again I

1062
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:40,699
think they talked about the compound but

1063
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:45,760
it wasn't okay

1064
00:54:40,699 --> 00:54:48,589
yeah it's called can ana Big Mo Vaughn

1065
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:50,710
what's up with the italians lately doing

1066
00:54:48,590 --> 00:54:53,360
all the awesome cannabis work man what

1067
00:54:50,710 --> 00:54:59,150
they've been absent for a while man I

1068
00:54:53,360 --> 00:55:01,190
love it though is because they've never

1069
00:54:59,150 --> 00:55:04,880
looked at them closely

1070
00:55:01,190 --> 00:55:07,670
they were hemp he saw them not very much

1071
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:13,430
THC they never looked at them now

1072
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:15,800
they're using a super-high pressure HPLC

1073
00:55:13,429 --> 00:55:20,419
where they could really really really

1074
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:23,420
see tiny tiny tiny tiny amounts so that

1075
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:26,360
also has a 3-chain as well dr. sheldon

1076
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:29,450
known as it has a five chain so it comes

1077
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:31,910
from it comes from ultimate acid but

1078
00:55:29,449 --> 00:55:34,339
it's not in the acid form in the paper

1079
00:55:31,909 --> 00:55:36,559
and I don't know that's because a lot of

1080
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:39,289
times when they identify these compounds

1081
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:41,299
they shoot them on the GC and if they

1082
00:55:39,289 --> 00:55:43,699
shoot it on the GC the acids going to

1083
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:46,850
decarboxylate right because the GC is a

1084
00:55:43,699 --> 00:55:49,309
it's kind of like a hot method but this

1085
00:55:46,849 --> 00:55:52,889
is just a cool looking molecule man

1086
00:55:49,309 --> 00:55:55,889
enough that's coming let's see that

1087
00:55:52,889 --> 00:55:58,078
it's just that you know do an organic

1088
00:55:55,889 --> 00:56:00,389
chemist like me I see there's

1089
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:02,400
stereochemistry there there's a benzene

1090
00:56:00,389 --> 00:56:06,379
ring there's all kinds of functionality

1091
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:06,380
there so it's it's a Santa molecule

1092
00:56:07,338 --> 00:56:15,480
well yeah there's hos our hydroxyl

1093
00:56:11,759 --> 00:56:19,920
groups right and so this like CBD is got

1094
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:21,869
the two hoh's on the benzene ring so

1095
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:24,659
that's what we call a resource and all

1096
00:56:21,869 --> 00:56:27,900
when they're separated by a carbon and

1097
00:56:24,659 --> 00:56:33,989
and rather than CBD it has this really

1098
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:37,108
crazy hydroxylated let's see can you

1099
00:56:33,989 --> 00:56:43,139
guys see that oh there we go

1100
00:56:37,108 --> 00:56:47,730
has this hydroxylated cyclopentane ring

1101
00:56:43,139 --> 00:56:50,338
that's got the same group that the CBD

1102
00:56:47,730 --> 00:56:52,528
has in the in a methyl cyclopentane down

1103
00:56:50,338 --> 00:56:55,380
there but it's really cool because up

1104
00:56:52,528 --> 00:57:00,389
here it's got a ketone and that's why

1105
00:56:55,380 --> 00:57:03,539
it's an own moan so what was that what

1106
00:57:00,389 --> 00:57:06,798
was that hanging at the bottom there my

1107
00:57:03,539 --> 00:57:10,680
beard no they have the molecule

1108
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:25,079
I was gonna ask about the steel your

1109
00:57:10,679 --> 00:57:31,949
face but your phone from your computer

1110
00:57:25,079 --> 00:57:34,200
screen there's some green it happened

1111
00:57:31,949 --> 00:57:35,909
when your phone lost its light so when

1112
00:57:34,199 --> 00:57:38,759
your phone had light we couldn't see it

1113
00:57:35,909 --> 00:57:43,429
then your phone like went half dark and

1114
00:57:38,759 --> 00:57:49,440
then it showed up Garcia

1115
00:57:43,429 --> 00:57:52,980
it was a Dark Star I mean here's another

1116
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:55,019
compound that's found in cannabis again

1117
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:59,338
I think this is a group from Italy and

1118
00:57:55,018 --> 00:58:02,969
and um chimera knows these guys I know

1119
00:57:59,338 --> 00:58:04,549
their accounts they're Italian all right

1120
00:58:02,969 --> 00:58:08,059
my pythons

1121
00:58:04,550 --> 00:58:11,269
so how cool is this that as analytical

1122
00:58:08,059 --> 00:58:13,279
chemistry basically intersects with

1123
00:58:11,269 --> 00:58:16,070
what's going on with plant breeding

1124
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:18,860
today they're gonna end up finding all

1125
00:58:16,070 --> 00:58:21,650
the other compounds that are in these

1126
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:24,769
extracts and potential things that can

1127
00:58:21,650 --> 00:58:27,110
provide real untold therapeutic value

1128
00:58:24,769 --> 00:58:28,750
and part of the entourage effect which

1129
00:58:27,110 --> 00:58:30,800
is how we got started on this anyway

1130
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:33,469
super cool for sure

1131
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:37,880
question on science if I could put into

1132
00:58:33,469 --> 00:58:40,099
the panel and it may be people hearing

1133
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:42,050
him at one of the only licensed at bars

1134
00:58:40,099 --> 00:58:46,639
trying to figure out how not to spread

1135
00:58:42,050 --> 00:58:48,620
coronavirus through shared cannabis used

1136
00:58:46,639 --> 00:58:51,889
to passing joints around for tens of

1137
00:58:48,619 --> 00:58:53,089
thousands of years I tried to research

1138
00:58:51,889 --> 00:58:56,869
because I'm in charge of writing the

1139
00:58:53,090 --> 00:58:58,309
policy there's almost nothing there's no

1140
00:58:56,869 --> 00:59:00,230
science that I found that said that

1141
00:58:58,309 --> 00:59:05,469
there was to see is being shared between

1142
00:59:00,230 --> 00:59:05,469
cannabis users nothing wash your hands

1143
00:59:14,650 --> 00:59:23,660
literally had to go in a wheelchair

1144
00:59:16,849 --> 00:59:25,250
security one time so and then I couldn't

1145
00:59:23,659 --> 00:59:29,889
find anything on how to clean the ribs

1146
00:59:25,250 --> 00:59:29,889
so there's my anybody knows anything

1147
00:59:31,449 --> 00:59:40,369
else terrorize it's time out time out

1148
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:43,880
because you're also when the person

1149
00:59:40,369 --> 00:59:49,069
takes the rip and then coughs all over

1150
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:50,570
the place and it's just like we're not

1151
00:59:49,070 --> 00:59:52,430
really seeing what's coming out but

1152
00:59:50,570 --> 00:59:55,850
trust me stuff's coming out it's why the

1153
00:59:52,429 --> 00:59:58,429
look flew always gets you how many years

1154
00:59:55,849 --> 01:00:00,139
ago doesn't Sam that we that that your

1155
00:59:58,429 --> 01:00:08,389
wife ended up in the bloody hospital

1156
01:00:00,139 --> 01:00:11,089
after I was dying for three weeks after

1157
01:00:08,389 --> 01:00:14,210
the people I know actually do get sick

1158
01:00:11,090 --> 01:00:18,350
from chair and George Aaron bombs in

1159
01:00:14,210 --> 01:00:22,190
floors plain simple it happens year

1160
01:00:18,349 --> 01:00:24,889
year you okay here's every event I got

1161
01:00:22,190 --> 01:00:25,789
homes I just don't share anymore all

1162
01:00:24,889 --> 01:00:27,409
right here you go

1163
01:00:25,789 --> 01:00:29,329
right here's the thing called a

1164
01:00:27,409 --> 01:00:31,699
mouthpiece that's basically it's a

1165
01:00:29,329 --> 01:00:34,639
silicone mouthpiece it's Universal on

1166
01:00:31,699 --> 01:00:37,069
this side and you basically can put it

1167
01:00:34,639 --> 01:00:41,029
on any pipe and it's for an individual

1168
01:00:37,070 --> 01:00:43,280
to carry around I am and I am for people

1169
01:00:41,030 --> 01:00:45,800
to get these especially if you're going

1170
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:47,420
to events and utilizing add events

1171
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:48,860
you're not putting your mouth or

1172
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:51,590
anything you're just going and hitting

1173
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:53,900
it like this when it comes to cleaning

1174
01:00:51,590 --> 01:00:57,980
pipes I highly recommend you know things

1175
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:59,539
like grunge off to soak you know your

1176
01:00:57,980 --> 01:01:02,000
pipes to get especially if you're doing

1177
01:00:59,539 --> 01:01:04,489
dabbing it's one of the best things to

1178
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:08,179
get the resin off usually can take a

1179
01:01:04,489 --> 01:01:10,909
quick soak and then more alcohol at

1180
01:01:08,179 --> 01:01:14,389
first to get a lot of the large resin

1181
01:01:10,909 --> 01:01:16,670
off and then get that out and then use

1182
01:01:14,389 --> 01:01:19,279
this as a finisher because this cleans

1183
01:01:16,670 --> 01:01:21,470
the glass so it doesn't get mookie I

1184
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:23,930
suck that [ __ ] overnight and then rinse

1185
01:01:21,469 --> 01:01:25,519
it and it's a perfect like it doesn't

1186
01:01:23,929 --> 01:01:26,989
matter how dirty the pipe is I just fill

1187
01:01:25,519 --> 01:01:29,780
it up with grunge off put it in my

1188
01:01:26,989 --> 01:01:31,189
cupboard 24 hours later I pour the

1189
01:01:29,780 --> 01:01:33,200
grunge off back in the bottle I've been

1190
01:01:31,190 --> 01:01:35,539
using the same grunge off for like I

1191
01:01:33,199 --> 01:01:37,309
mean it's got to get eight years at this

1192
01:01:35,539 --> 01:01:39,289
put it through a coffee filter so you

1193
01:01:37,309 --> 01:01:42,349
don't get all that resin back in there

1194
01:01:39,289 --> 01:01:47,000
but you can buy reverie straight yours

1195
01:01:42,349 --> 01:01:49,670
is button at the debt at the dab bar I

1196
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:51,289
think at a minimum there has to be an

1197
01:01:49,670 --> 01:01:55,450
alcohol wipe and we think about it

1198
01:01:51,289 --> 01:02:20,199
someone just put their mouth to that and

1199
01:01:55,449 --> 01:02:22,309
so that would be just do cleaning yeah I

1200
01:02:20,199 --> 01:02:24,259
thought you were gonna ask a more

1201
01:02:22,309 --> 01:02:29,210
interesting question to me which is that

1202
01:02:24,260 --> 01:02:30,830
if somebody is contaminated and I'm not

1203
01:02:29,210 --> 01:02:31,789
saying that somebody is but let's say

1204
01:02:30,829 --> 01:02:34,849
someone who

1205
01:02:31,789 --> 01:02:41,389
comes in to your thing even if you're

1206
01:02:34,849 --> 01:02:44,360
more imaging well okay let's just okay

1207
01:02:41,389 --> 01:02:50,739
not your place Deb someone comes into a

1208
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:50,740
communal cruise ship is about to unload

1209
01:02:51,340 --> 01:02:57,410
one of those people come to your place

1210
01:02:54,139 --> 01:03:00,889
uses the thing the question is is even

1211
01:02:57,409 --> 01:03:03,409
with a a wipe of the thing does it still

1212
01:03:00,889 --> 01:03:06,739
risk contamination to the next

1213
01:03:03,409 --> 01:03:08,989
individual who uses that rig and I think

1214
01:03:06,739 --> 01:03:11,149
again I don't know the answer to that

1215
01:03:08,989 --> 01:03:12,979
question but and again I think what

1216
01:03:11,150 --> 01:03:17,329
Marcus said is really important which is

1217
01:03:12,980 --> 01:03:20,360
that after they take the the RHIB they

1218
01:03:17,329 --> 01:03:21,889
can't be around to cough all over the

1219
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:23,870
rig because now you're gonna get it on

1220
01:03:21,889 --> 01:03:26,329
the outside of the rig over by the now

1221
01:03:23,869 --> 01:03:38,150
just gonna be absolutely gross and

1222
01:03:26,329 --> 01:03:45,949
disgusting and they study the pipes and

1223
01:03:38,150 --> 01:03:49,130
surprise yeah you can spread germs Matt

1224
01:03:45,949 --> 01:03:52,159
well but I mean really the fact is is

1225
01:03:49,130 --> 01:03:55,550
that the dad bar is no different than

1226
01:03:52,159 --> 01:03:58,159
the in-and-out burger that they just

1227
01:03:55,550 --> 01:04:01,820
came from or the library that they're

1228
01:03:58,159 --> 01:04:05,949
going to later or any other public place

1229
01:04:01,820 --> 01:04:08,420
I mean we live in microbial world

1230
01:04:05,949 --> 01:04:10,699
everywhere I think if you add up the

1231
01:04:08,420 --> 01:04:13,159
entire mass of microbes in the world

1232
01:04:10,699 --> 01:04:13,879
it's like thousands of times more than

1233
01:04:13,159 --> 01:04:16,759
humans

1234
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:20,539
so I mean yes we get I don't get the flu

1235
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:22,430
from like burger joints but I sure have

1236
01:04:20,539 --> 01:04:24,380
gotten sick at some of these cannabis

1237
01:04:22,429 --> 01:04:28,579
cups like a good percentage of them well

1238
01:04:24,380 --> 01:04:30,860
yeah I agree 100% mark yes I got every

1239
01:04:28,579 --> 01:04:33,559
time I go to MJ biz or any any one of

1240
01:04:30,860 --> 01:04:35,960
these any of them it's just I try to

1241
01:04:33,559 --> 01:04:38,949
wash my hands as much as I can because

1242
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:45,559
the work field flu is just so real just

1243
01:04:38,949 --> 01:04:47,359
smashed here with this virus looks scary

1244
01:04:45,559 --> 01:04:50,599
Debbi I would also recommend keeping a

1245
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:52,280
spray bottle with 91% alcohol to 100%

1246
01:04:50,599 --> 01:04:53,960
alcohol and sprayed on the outside of

1247
01:04:52,280 --> 01:05:10,340
the bonds as well and wipe them down

1248
01:04:53,960 --> 01:05:13,389
after each use good for dislodging that

1249
01:05:10,340 --> 01:05:13,390
type of stuff and they were doing

1250
01:05:17,289 --> 01:05:30,800
loosened our employee policies we do

1251
01:05:20,269 --> 01:05:38,300
have time you're over 65 don't use the

1252
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:39,950
rig Mike West said alcohol will kill the

1253
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:41,840
bacteria but not as effective on the

1254
01:05:39,949 --> 01:05:46,759
virus commercial dishwasher with steam

1255
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:48,890
sterilization between uses I was

1256
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:51,650
thinking about peroxide what about a

1257
01:05:48,889 --> 01:05:54,519
peroxide dunk for you know 15 minutes 10

1258
01:05:51,650 --> 01:05:58,400
15 you guys think about that

1259
01:05:54,519 --> 01:06:05,420
we're probiotics oh it's hard to say

1260
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:07,610
with virus right with yeah like an

1261
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:10,340
interesting point around supply chain

1262
01:06:07,610 --> 01:06:14,320
because you know let's face it

1263
01:06:10,340 --> 01:06:17,510
a lot of the cannabis supply chain

1264
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:20,600
hardware like vape pens come from China

1265
01:06:17,510 --> 01:06:26,450
a lot of stuff comes from China and that

1266
01:06:20,599 --> 01:06:28,219
just say well I mean you know what is

1267
01:06:26,449 --> 01:06:32,149
the impact of this because you know

1268
01:06:28,219 --> 01:06:36,619
again I guess yeah can you somehow do

1269
01:06:32,150 --> 01:06:39,019
quality control measures to make sure

1270
01:06:36,619 --> 01:06:41,630
that the stuff you're importing from

1271
01:06:39,019 --> 01:06:46,599
these places aren't going to contaminate

1272
01:06:41,630 --> 01:06:46,599
your operation it's a crazy challenge

1273
01:06:46,630 --> 01:06:51,050
yeah I mean it's that's a real one

1274
01:06:49,159 --> 01:06:54,920
it's got out of hand a few times on this

1275
01:06:51,050 --> 01:07:00,050
as far as as far as I know nobody knows

1276
01:06:54,920 --> 01:07:04,670
how long it takes for somebody who's

1277
01:07:00,050 --> 01:07:08,900
been exposed to the virus to have

1278
01:07:04,670 --> 01:07:11,510
symptoms or work and be tested I mean is

1279
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:14,690
it one minute is it one day and they

1280
01:07:11,510 --> 01:07:17,060
don't know how long it is people there

1281
01:07:14,690 --> 01:07:21,650
once they've got it before they're

1282
01:07:17,059 --> 01:07:25,489
contagious nobody knows I know this much

1283
01:07:21,650 --> 01:07:29,119
I am NOT going to go to any cannabis

1284
01:07:25,489 --> 01:07:31,549
cups in the very near future and share

1285
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:33,969
rigs with a thousand people what about

1286
01:07:31,550 --> 01:07:36,260
Al Canucks they use that to clean

1287
01:07:33,969 --> 01:07:38,480
laboratory sterilized you know

1288
01:07:36,260 --> 01:07:42,520
laboratory i justit's just a really good

1289
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:45,769
detergent I mean what does it somehow

1290
01:07:42,519 --> 01:07:47,900
denature the virus so you got think

1291
01:07:45,769 --> 01:07:50,539
about how a virus works a virus is just

1292
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:53,630
it's not like a bacteria like it's not

1293
01:07:50,539 --> 01:07:56,630
an organism it's just like a bundle of

1294
01:07:53,630 --> 01:07:59,420
DNA that somehow gets into your cells

1295
01:07:56,630 --> 01:08:04,099
and get you viral infected

1296
01:07:59,420 --> 01:08:08,269
yeah viruses are our [ __ ] because our

1297
01:08:04,099 --> 01:08:10,940
immune system has really adapted great

1298
01:08:08,269 --> 01:08:15,739
ways to basically about them but they

1299
01:08:10,940 --> 01:08:17,600
they can mutate too as well so it's like

1300
01:08:15,739 --> 01:08:20,000
a game of chess they're playing with one

1301
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:25,400
another yeah but the notion again that

1302
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:28,550
you could come up with a vaccine for it

1303
01:08:25,399 --> 01:08:33,259
in a small period of time is pretty

1304
01:08:28,550 --> 01:08:35,088
dubious recognizing and remembering that

1305
01:08:33,260 --> 01:08:38,030
cannabis actually has antiviral

1306
01:08:35,088 --> 01:08:39,979
properties and I think it's really good

1307
01:08:38,029 --> 01:08:43,819
to have the conversation about how to

1308
01:08:39,979 --> 01:08:46,429
reduce the spread but as a general thing

1309
01:08:43,819 --> 01:08:49,039
let's all remember that the ECS the

1310
01:08:46,430 --> 01:08:52,030
endocannabinoid system is about keeping

1311
01:08:49,039 --> 01:08:55,489
us healthy keeping homeostasis and my

1312
01:08:52,029 --> 01:08:57,889
belief to the to the center of me is

1313
01:08:55,489 --> 01:09:00,028
that cannabis can in fact help our

1314
01:08:57,890 --> 01:09:02,039
immune systems identify this virus

1315
01:09:00,029 --> 01:09:03,750
as an issue and deal with it in the way

1316
01:09:02,038 --> 01:09:06,238
that we've evolved to deal with viruses

1317
01:09:03,750 --> 01:09:08,788
before now oh my god

1318
01:09:06,238 --> 01:09:13,278
yeah recently a group from Canada showed

1319
01:09:08,788 --> 01:09:18,588
good any bacterial properties of CBG

1320
01:09:13,279 --> 01:09:22,529
against MRSA which is the strain of

1321
01:09:18,588 --> 01:09:26,759
bacteria that's resistant to or it's a

1322
01:09:22,529 --> 01:09:31,139
in the resistant strain of Staph but

1323
01:09:26,759 --> 01:09:34,229
yeah I mean I absolutely wait I think

1324
01:09:31,139 --> 01:09:38,009
our own body's chemistry is the way that

1325
01:09:34,229 --> 01:09:40,108
we fight off viruses because you know

1326
01:09:38,009 --> 01:09:42,750
the old adage that you know a little

1327
01:09:40,109 --> 01:09:44,520
dirt is good for you I mean you know

1328
01:09:42,750 --> 01:09:47,009
getting sick as a kid and having

1329
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:51,029
chickenpox and going through all the you

1330
01:09:47,009 --> 01:09:53,158
know fevers and viruses that you had

1331
01:09:51,029 --> 01:09:56,369
when you're a kid kind of conditions

1332
01:09:53,158 --> 01:09:58,920
your immune system which is the most

1333
01:09:56,368 --> 01:10:01,348
powerful you know pharmaceutical company

1334
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:03,328
on the planet so if your immune system

1335
01:10:01,349 --> 01:10:06,179
is nurtured through the nurturing of

1336
01:10:03,328 --> 01:10:09,090
your endocannabinoids system I do do

1337
01:10:06,179 --> 01:10:13,380
great you're absolutely correct did you

1338
01:10:09,090 --> 01:10:15,599
guys have chicken pox parties all this

1339
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:23,880
talk about the kid I did yeah you

1340
01:10:15,599 --> 01:10:25,940
probably even had the Me's having give

1341
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:29,788
your kid the measles

1342
01:10:25,939 --> 01:10:32,250
I think vaccinations make a lot more

1343
01:10:29,788 --> 01:10:37,319
sense than measles parties that's just

1344
01:10:32,250 --> 01:10:40,380
my opinion right a man decides hey I

1345
01:10:37,319 --> 01:10:44,819
wanted to give a shout-out to a fallen

1346
01:10:40,380 --> 01:10:46,828
friend when my channel fell I I heard

1347
01:10:44,819 --> 01:10:50,069
the news that some cool had passed away

1348
01:10:46,828 --> 01:10:54,769
in the night yeah I have known some cool

1349
01:10:50,069 --> 01:10:57,538
I new sub for 20-plus years originally

1350
01:10:54,770 --> 01:10:59,579
we just met online and through the

1351
01:10:57,538 --> 01:11:01,979
forums and eventually met at the

1352
01:10:59,578 --> 01:11:05,058
Cannabis Cup in Amsterdam probably G

1353
01:11:01,979 --> 01:11:07,948
that would have been like maybe early to

1354
01:11:05,059 --> 01:11:11,159
mid-2000s that he sort of was was around

1355
01:11:07,948 --> 01:11:13,169
and doing his thing and just how to

1356
01:11:11,158 --> 01:11:14,909
really you know long

1357
01:11:13,170 --> 01:11:17,310
long friendship with him and I know he

1358
01:11:14,909 --> 01:11:20,279
caused also it's a crazy vibe sometimes

1359
01:11:17,310 --> 01:11:23,520
in in the community online and people

1360
01:11:20,279 --> 01:11:26,340
loved him or hated them but I had loved

1361
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:28,800
for sub I mean he was the one thing I

1362
01:11:26,340 --> 01:11:30,750
always could guarantee was if I got

1363
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:32,279
seeds or genetics from him that they

1364
01:11:30,750 --> 01:11:34,198
would be full melt certified with the

1365
01:11:32,279 --> 01:11:37,079
resin that would grow from those plants

1366
01:11:34,198 --> 01:11:38,698
would melt into a liquid and drip

1367
01:11:37,079 --> 01:11:41,729
through the tightest of screens and

1368
01:11:38,698 --> 01:11:44,428
that's sort of where my respect began

1369
01:11:41,729 --> 01:11:46,198
for him where all the quirkiness and the

1370
01:11:44,429 --> 01:11:48,239
and the sort of fun personality things

1371
01:11:46,198 --> 01:11:51,569
were great but the fact that he just

1372
01:11:48,238 --> 01:11:54,359
produced great genetics that always had

1373
01:11:51,569 --> 01:11:56,969
really nice terpene content you know the

1374
01:11:54,359 --> 01:12:00,329
Astro Boy aka the watermelon one of my

1375
01:11:56,969 --> 01:12:03,000
one of my favorites for sure and just

1376
01:12:00,329 --> 01:12:04,769
I'll miss that guy it's it was really

1377
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:06,359
sad to hear that he that he passed away

1378
01:12:04,770 --> 01:12:09,270
and I know that right before he passed

1379
01:12:06,359 --> 01:12:11,909
away he had some hard times again so the

1380
01:12:09,270 --> 01:12:14,580
guy went through a lot of [ __ ] like it

1381
01:12:11,909 --> 01:12:16,198
was kind of incredible some of the stuff

1382
01:12:14,579 --> 01:12:20,609
that he went through but yeah I just

1383
01:12:16,198 --> 01:12:25,139
wanted to puff a bowl for sub and second

1384
01:12:20,609 --> 01:12:27,359
that markets out there and he continues

1385
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:30,480
to live on in the beautiful genetics

1386
01:12:27,359 --> 01:12:32,519
that everybody continues to grow so grow

1387
01:12:30,479 --> 01:12:35,189
beautifully and grow them with love and

1388
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:37,410
spread them to others so that others may

1389
01:12:35,189 --> 01:12:40,139
know this man's wonderful genetics

1390
01:12:37,409 --> 01:12:43,559
because we carried them we sold them to

1391
01:12:40,140 --> 01:12:47,219
patients for years and he was a quirky

1392
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:49,500
amazing soul and yeah it was a sucker

1393
01:12:47,219 --> 01:12:50,698
punch to the soul to hear that he passed

1394
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:54,920
away in the middle of the night and

1395
01:12:50,698 --> 01:12:57,238
didn't get to say goodbye so yes

1396
01:12:54,920 --> 01:13:00,149
speaking to the quirkiness right a lot

1397
01:12:57,238 --> 01:13:02,399
of us fruit for at least for me last

1398
01:13:00,149 --> 01:13:04,710
time we talked was on hash Church right

1399
01:13:02,399 --> 01:13:08,159
when he was on and it was it was like

1400
01:13:04,710 --> 01:13:10,800
right after the fire right and remember

1401
01:13:08,159 --> 01:13:12,899
the story he told he's like literally he

1402
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:16,710
got out with was his baseball cap a

1403
01:13:12,899 --> 01:13:21,420
backpack at a ball I mean he was just

1404
01:13:16,710 --> 01:13:24,000
such an animated storyteller man amazing

1405
01:13:21,420 --> 01:13:26,819
like he was amazing I mean he keep

1406
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:30,210
contributed you know like Marcus it

1407
01:13:26,819 --> 01:13:34,049
I noticed his incredible eye and and

1408
01:13:30,210 --> 01:13:36,750
really his selection capability to make

1409
01:13:34,050 --> 01:13:40,320
offspring that just was phenomenal and

1410
01:13:36,750 --> 01:13:42,779
in every respective of running it I mean

1411
01:13:40,319 --> 01:13:44,819
from cultivating it to smoking it to the

1412
01:13:42,779 --> 01:13:46,529
vaporizing and then washing it it's just

1413
01:13:44,819 --> 01:13:49,349
there's very few guys out there that

1414
01:13:46,529 --> 01:13:52,349
could really do that with their work and

1415
01:13:49,349 --> 01:13:55,529
he shared as well just like just like

1416
01:13:52,349 --> 01:13:58,110
Marcus and you know Scout man he's a

1417
01:13:55,529 --> 01:14:00,779
wealth of knowledge and say what you

1418
01:13:58,109 --> 01:14:03,868
will about him but he contributed more

1419
01:14:00,779 --> 01:14:08,009
than I mean most people and in the

1420
01:14:03,868 --> 01:14:09,630
community and you know he's he's given

1421
01:14:08,010 --> 01:14:11,639
us a lot you know I asked I still have

1422
01:14:09,630 --> 01:14:14,099
packs that he gave me 20 some years ago

1423
01:14:11,639 --> 01:14:16,109
that I do you know still have like three

1424
01:14:14,099 --> 01:14:18,869
seeds or four seeds of and I'm wait I'm

1425
01:14:16,109 --> 01:14:20,848
waiting to go back through that and you

1426
01:14:18,868 --> 01:14:24,089
know it kind of you know and then when I

1427
01:14:20,849 --> 01:14:27,060
heard the passing I immediately went and

1428
01:14:24,090 --> 01:14:28,560
got more because I I was afraid I had

1429
01:14:27,060 --> 01:14:30,179
been on my mind that I wanted to get

1430
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:33,090
some of the stuff that I'd lost like the

1431
01:14:30,179 --> 01:14:36,359
void and third dimension and there's a

1432
01:14:33,090 --> 01:14:38,789
lot of really great stuff so young guys

1433
01:14:36,359 --> 01:14:40,500
out there get on that sub cool stuff

1434
01:14:38,789 --> 01:14:42,779
because it's it's not gonna be around

1435
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:45,029
for long I think the whole bubble bags

1436
01:14:42,779 --> 01:14:47,009
and his genetics just went so

1437
01:14:45,029 --> 01:14:50,219
hand-in-hand that I naturally became a

1438
01:14:47,010 --> 01:14:52,679
proponent of his cultivars and he was

1439
01:14:50,219 --> 01:14:55,500
constantly turning people on to bubble

1440
01:14:52,679 --> 01:14:58,319
bags making hash and showing people how

1441
01:14:55,500 --> 01:15:00,630
to make cash and get in the hash to to

1442
01:14:58,319 --> 01:15:02,519
key people that you know built their

1443
01:15:00,630 --> 01:15:05,730
names as hash makers because they had

1444
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:07,710
this incredible material from sub I'll

1445
01:15:05,729 --> 01:15:09,529
tell you a funny story well kind of a

1446
01:15:07,710 --> 01:15:12,060
funny story kind of a sad story although

1447
01:15:09,529 --> 01:15:15,539
one of the years we were in Amsterdam we

1448
01:15:12,060 --> 01:15:19,829
were all staying at a gypsy Nirvana's

1449
01:15:15,539 --> 01:15:21,988
and it was his friend Danny was there as

1450
01:15:19,828 --> 01:15:24,059
well and this was the night that Danny

1451
01:15:21,988 --> 01:15:26,598
passed away and that was the cultivar

1452
01:15:24,060 --> 01:15:29,070
that sub went and created the Danny Boy

1453
01:15:26,599 --> 01:15:31,380
but he yeah we were staying in this

1454
01:15:29,069 --> 01:15:33,359
giant house that gypsy had and basically

1455
01:15:31,380 --> 01:15:35,219
that Danny guy had gone out and had the

1456
01:15:33,359 --> 01:15:36,920
night of his lifetime in Amsterdam just

1457
01:15:35,219 --> 01:15:40,198
had a great night and a great meal and

1458
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:42,658
partied hard and you know passed

1459
01:15:40,198 --> 01:15:45,328
in his sleep as well so it's kind of

1460
01:15:42,658 --> 01:15:48,118
right eared can and that was probably 15

1461
01:15:45,328 --> 01:15:51,208
years ago now maybe even maybe even more

1462
01:15:48,118 --> 01:15:53,880
but that happen so I'm glad that he's

1463
01:15:51,208 --> 01:15:56,130
you know not in pain anymore that COPD

1464
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:59,340
that he had that lung thing this was

1465
01:15:56,130 --> 01:16:01,380
pretty serious [ __ ] and it was just a

1466
01:15:59,340 --> 01:16:03,690
bummer for for it to kind of go so

1467
01:16:01,380 --> 01:16:08,279
sideways right there at the end I'll

1468
01:16:03,689 --> 01:16:09,899
definitely never forget sub absolutely I

1469
01:16:08,279 --> 01:16:12,599
still have the jacks cleaner cut that's

1470
01:16:09,899 --> 01:16:15,658
that's one thing that I I really really

1471
01:16:12,599 --> 01:16:17,309
love and and I will say the guy grew the

1472
01:16:15,658 --> 01:16:19,259
jack cleaner too and that stuff it's

1473
01:16:17,309 --> 01:16:21,989
just as phenomenal it's just a little

1474
01:16:19,260 --> 01:16:26,780
bit a little bit more modern if you will

1475
01:16:21,988 --> 01:16:30,029
as a bit more stacked trichomes than the

1476
01:16:26,779 --> 01:16:33,779
uniform but so it's still a great great

1477
01:16:30,029 --> 01:16:36,179
writing awesome well right on I'm glad I

1478
01:16:33,779 --> 01:16:54,478
did not forget that that was kind of in

1479
01:16:36,179 --> 01:16:56,609
my here's a rib for sure I didn't want

1480
01:16:54,479 --> 01:16:58,079

1496
01:17:52,050 --> 01:17:55,510
same time there

1497
01:17:53,139 --> 01:17:58,960
going to work and producing great

1498
01:17:55,510 --> 01:18:00,880
fashion working in these farms there's

1499
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:02,859
just such an excitement of being able to

1500
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:04,630
do it without having your door kicked in

1501
01:18:02,859 --> 01:18:06,759
a gun put to your head and then put in a

1502
01:18:04,630 --> 01:18:07,329
cage for a serious amount of time yes

1503
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:09,550
thank you

1504
01:18:07,329 --> 01:18:11,920
when you remove all that all the other

1505
01:18:09,550 --> 01:18:13,570
[ __ ] is like Oh what like how much

1506
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:16,300
is the tax and oh there's all these

1507
01:18:13,569 --> 01:18:19,299
bureaucracies and I gotta deal with it's

1508
01:18:16,300 --> 01:18:21,460
like that [ __ ] all piled up on top of

1509
01:18:19,300 --> 01:18:24,550
itself does not equal the insanity that

1510
01:18:21,460 --> 01:18:26,880
we all can what what what is the current

1511
01:18:24,550 --> 01:18:29,710
status of the industry up there Markus I

1512
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:32,429
read something toward the end of this

1513
01:18:29,710 --> 01:18:37,319
week I can't remember where that but

1514
01:18:32,429 --> 01:18:39,760
several facilities that were planned for

1515
01:18:37,319 --> 01:18:43,329
large-scale production or basically

1516
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:45,610
being mothballed yeah that's what I saw

1517
01:18:43,329 --> 01:18:47,948
the same story canopy shut down an

1518
01:18:45,609 --> 01:18:52,929
Aldergrove greenhouse and a delta

1519
01:18:47,948 --> 01:18:59,698
greenhouse I think I laid off about 500

1520
01:18:52,929 --> 01:19:03,100
people people employed flora do you know

1521
01:18:59,698 --> 01:19:05,529
well I don't know canopy's been rocking

1522
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:07,780
and rolling for a while I saw quite a

1523
01:19:05,529 --> 01:19:09,969
few of them were actually from out of

1524
01:19:07,779 --> 01:19:11,649
the country and are the actress because

1525
01:19:09,969 --> 01:19:12,939
they're on some sort of work bees did

1526
01:19:11,649 --> 01:19:15,789
actually work at the

1527
01:19:12,939 --> 01:19:16,960
you know the canopy spot so even those

1528
01:19:15,789 --> 01:19:21,698
people have to go back to their

1529
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:24,969
perspective yeah - find him a place they

1530
01:19:21,698 --> 01:19:26,529
had no they were here for work Jesus so

1531
01:19:24,969 --> 01:19:28,600
they're all signed back on planes the

1532
01:19:26,529 --> 01:19:32,050
day after they shut down I did a little

1533
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:34,659
talking and yeah it was and it's not

1534
01:19:32,050 --> 01:19:36,969
just canopy and then they opened the

1535
01:19:34,658 --> 01:19:38,948
collective growth Bruce went and opened

1536
01:19:36,969 --> 01:19:40,510
up the next day so you had canopy growth

1537
01:19:38,948 --> 01:19:42,488
falling and then you se open up

1538
01:19:40,510 --> 01:19:44,699
collective growth so that's that's kind

1539
01:19:42,488 --> 01:19:46,899
of it's his new adventure down the us

1540
01:19:44,698 --> 01:19:48,759
but I mean this is straight across the

1541
01:19:46,899 --> 01:19:51,099
moor with all the big licensed producers

1542
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:53,380
from Aurora stocks are crashing from

1543
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:54,760
total radon 9 dollars there's all kinds

1544
01:19:53,380 --> 01:19:58,069
of things going across the board about

1545
01:19:54,760 --> 01:20:01,280
all these lp's someone that sued

1546
01:19:58,069 --> 01:20:04,309
for not producing there's over 1 million

1547
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:06,529
pounds there's some article I've done on

1548
01:20:04,310 --> 01:20:09,710
my phone here 1.2 million pounds of

1549
01:20:06,529 --> 01:20:12,469
storage so I mean and where's all this

1550
01:20:09,710 --> 01:20:14,600
cannabis going right well why were they

1551
01:20:12,470 --> 01:20:16,820
hiring out of country what have

1552
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:20,470
Canadians only their jobs it's only 13

1553
01:20:16,819 --> 01:20:24,229
80 an hour right so I mean come on so

1554
01:20:20,470 --> 01:20:25,850
yeah so yeah we did a little episode on

1555
01:20:24,229 --> 01:20:27,169
cannabis culture news live on Friday

1556
01:20:25,850 --> 01:20:32,480
about it and I'm really covered all

1557
01:20:27,170 --> 01:20:34,430
these topics because I mean right now we

1558
01:20:32,479 --> 01:20:36,079
see all these head CEOs they're all

1559
01:20:34,430 --> 01:20:37,880
number a head of the companies anymore

1560
01:20:36,079 --> 01:20:40,609
from Terry boots you know all these guys

1561
01:20:37,880 --> 01:20:41,750
are all gone all great guys but I mean

1562
01:20:40,609 --> 01:20:43,759
at the same time the company's

1563
01:20:41,750 --> 01:20:45,979
completely crashed the bombs falling out

1564
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:48,079
their stocks are worth nothing there's

1565
01:20:45,979 --> 01:20:50,089
dry cannabis straight across the board

1566
01:20:48,079 --> 01:20:52,519
people are getting stuff that was

1567
01:20:50,090 --> 01:20:54,170
produced over a year ago now because

1568
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:56,570
it's just so much backs towards right

1569
01:20:54,170 --> 01:20:58,430
like everybody's grown on their own now

1570
01:20:56,569 --> 01:20:59,689
which is fantastic and that's one great

1571
01:20:58,430 --> 01:21:01,520
thing I see is a lot of people are

1572
01:20:59,689 --> 01:21:02,989
starting to grow they're on four plants

1573
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:05,750
and you know what the people that really

1574
01:21:02,989 --> 01:21:07,670
want to count and I'm seeing that now so

1575
01:21:05,750 --> 01:21:09,500
as the year progresses with legalization

1576
01:21:07,670 --> 01:21:11,600
people stop and get more and more free

1577
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:13,670
that they're understanding yeah the door

1578
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:16,400
isn't gonna get kicked in I can do this

1579
01:21:13,670 --> 01:21:18,529
I can make hash at home but that fear is

1580
01:21:16,399 --> 01:21:20,000
slowly going away which is great and

1581
01:21:18,529 --> 01:21:22,489
that's why I believe while these places

1582
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:24,020
are failing to because hey [ __ ] that's a

1583
01:21:22,489 --> 01:21:25,670
plan just for this right on the flip

1584
01:21:24,020 --> 01:21:28,090
side of what Johnny B is saying I think

1585
01:21:25,670 --> 01:21:34,609
there are a lot of companies in Canada

1586
01:21:28,090 --> 01:21:37,190
am I doing that feedback there's a lot

1587
01:21:34,609 --> 01:21:38,899
of companies that were inflated and they

1588
01:21:37,189 --> 01:21:41,479
were smoking mirrors and they were never

1589
01:21:38,899 --> 01:21:44,449
maybe really that real and I think that

1590
01:21:41,479 --> 01:21:47,599
they created this big bubble that wasn't

1591
01:21:44,449 --> 01:21:48,949
real and then that's collapsing and

1592
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:51,380
everyone's like I don't know no it's

1593
01:21:48,949 --> 01:21:53,510
like well is it oh no like maybe maybe

1594
01:21:51,380 --> 01:21:56,270
maybe it's better off with people who

1595
01:21:53,510 --> 01:21:58,489
are like more focused on doing it right

1596
01:21:56,270 --> 01:22:00,530
and getting it done the way it should be

1597
01:21:58,489 --> 01:22:03,349
done from knowing from the past ten or

1598
01:22:00,529 --> 01:22:06,409
twenty or thirty or forty years and you

1599
01:22:03,350 --> 01:22:08,120
know coming at it from a more realistic

1600
01:22:06,409 --> 01:22:11,399
perspective and not trying to just

1601
01:22:08,119 --> 01:22:13,979
inflate stocks and pump and dumps and

1602
01:22:11,399 --> 01:22:17,279
money and and really create an industry

1603
01:22:13,979 --> 01:22:19,319
and I think when the dust settles from

1604
01:22:17,279 --> 01:22:21,539
from the things that Johnny B's been

1605
01:22:19,319 --> 01:22:23,009
mentioning that there'll be some

1606
01:22:21,539 --> 01:22:25,890
standout companies and that there'll be

1607
01:22:23,010 --> 01:22:30,659
some things that are that are it'll be

1608
01:22:25,890 --> 01:22:34,530
learned from that's what I'm hoping I

1609
01:22:30,659 --> 01:22:37,229
agree with Marcus 100% it's it's a it's

1610
01:22:34,529 --> 01:22:38,789
a hard thing to do to you know when you

1611
01:22:37,229 --> 01:22:40,919
haven't been doing this to Marcus this

1612
01:22:38,789 --> 01:22:42,930
point for you know twenty thirty years

1613
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:45,510
and you don't know farming and

1614
01:22:42,930 --> 01:22:47,780
horticulture and the nuances of all

1615
01:22:45,510 --> 01:22:50,610
those things it's not an easy task

1616
01:22:47,779 --> 01:22:52,289
okay now now that now that people can

1617
01:22:50,609 --> 01:22:54,359
come in that aren't with all the big

1618
01:22:52,289 --> 01:22:56,130
pumping dumps and they can come in and

1619
01:22:54,359 --> 01:22:57,599
actually pretty much hopefully save this

1620
01:22:56,130 --> 01:22:59,039
industry and get people were kind of

1621
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:00,930
more focused on getting good quality

1622
01:22:59,039 --> 01:23:02,640
canvas the standards for patience and

1623
01:23:00,930 --> 01:23:04,829
stuff like that look at that older

1624
01:23:02,640 --> 01:23:06,420
aspect there's no places to smoke

1625
01:23:04,829 --> 01:23:07,409
there's no lounges or anything like that

1626
01:23:06,420 --> 01:23:09,720
that has to change

1627
01:23:07,409 --> 01:23:12,539
they shut down over 400 clubs across

1628
01:23:09,720 --> 01:23:14,100
Canada that poppy seed go smoke in so

1629
01:23:12,539 --> 01:23:15,810
those are all gone so it's it's really

1630
01:23:14,100 --> 01:23:17,700
hard for that right now so I think we're

1631
01:23:15,810 --> 01:23:19,140
gonna see a big change and once that

1632
01:23:17,699 --> 01:23:20,519
opens up I think they need to start

1633
01:23:19,140 --> 01:23:22,200
moving forward we're gonna start having

1634
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:24,900
companies could be seeing better a

1635
01:23:22,199 --> 01:23:26,760
shredder edibles eight pens so this will

1636
01:23:24,899 --> 01:23:27,929
like three point seven seven dollars or

1637
01:23:26,760 --> 01:23:29,970
the fake pens in the month of January

1638
01:23:27,930 --> 01:23:31,950
like they just went way through the

1639
01:23:29,970 --> 01:23:34,320
rooms right so that was an Ontario law

1640
01:23:31,949 --> 01:23:36,569
so people are now getting more in tune

1641
01:23:34,319 --> 01:23:37,979
with the system which is is good right

1642
01:23:36,569 --> 01:23:41,369
so I'm gonna see some progress

1643
01:23:37,979 --> 01:23:43,229
does it affect quality and price at the

1644
01:23:41,369 --> 01:23:46,380
dispensary level I mean at the retail

1645
01:23:43,229 --> 01:23:49,769
level are our because there's an

1646
01:23:46,380 --> 01:23:52,650
overabundance of cannabis our prices

1647
01:23:49,770 --> 01:23:55,470
going down or reasonable or do people

1648
01:23:52,649 --> 01:23:58,500
find that that's a prices are dropping

1649
01:23:55,470 --> 01:24:01,890
then black market cannabis I mean I

1650
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:03,750
think that's the big sort of switch over

1651
01:24:01,890 --> 01:24:05,880
in the states that has to still happen

1652
01:24:03,750 --> 01:24:08,520
because you know if you have a friend

1653
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:09,960
that can get you weed from some guy

1654
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:12,690
around the corner or whatever that's

1655
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:16,199
really good it's high-quality why would

1656
01:24:12,689 --> 01:24:18,989
you go pay that you know taxes and drive

1657
01:24:16,199 --> 01:24:21,989
to someone's dispensary and and get it

1658
01:24:18,989 --> 01:24:24,309
so do you think the dispensaries are

1659
01:24:21,989 --> 01:24:28,750
winning that in in Canada

1660
01:24:24,310 --> 01:24:31,450
I mean our people where people get to

1661
01:24:28,750 --> 01:24:34,449
read for there's no more dispensaries

1662
01:24:31,449 --> 01:24:37,119
have been like close dude like one on

1663
01:24:34,449 --> 01:24:40,029
Vancouver Island that was like we didn't

1664
01:24:37,119 --> 01:24:44,949
close and then they basically got a 1.5

1665
01:24:40,029 --> 01:24:46,750
million dollar fine like about and I

1666
01:24:44,949 --> 01:24:50,920
think recently they may have cut that in

1667
01:24:46,750 --> 01:24:53,319
half to 750,000 but that's just like now

1668
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:56,590
a tree's got the 1.5 million dollar fine

1669
01:24:53,319 --> 01:24:59,340
the fine was double what they sold from

1670
01:24:56,590 --> 01:25:01,600
that from October 17th when it was like

1671
01:24:59,340 --> 01:25:03,819
legalization no more selling at a

1672
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:08,289
dispensary level without like permits

1673
01:25:03,819 --> 01:25:10,149
licenses whatever and you know keep in

1674
01:25:08,289 --> 01:25:12,909
mind it's not like while they're doing

1675
01:25:10,149 --> 01:25:14,769
that that you there's no other options

1676
01:25:12,909 --> 01:25:17,409
in the meantime there's an actual system

1677
01:25:14,770 --> 01:25:19,240
of an enormous amount of people putting

1678
01:25:17,409 --> 01:25:21,609
time and energy and money and

1679
01:25:19,239 --> 01:25:23,829
applications and like people that aren't

1680
01:25:21,609 --> 01:25:26,259
just like business people but like

1681
01:25:23,829 --> 01:25:28,149
people that came from the other world

1682
01:25:26,260 --> 01:25:30,190
like the dispensary world dispensaries

1683
01:25:28,149 --> 01:25:32,920
that are like okay you're gonna give me

1684
01:25:30,189 --> 01:25:33,909
a mechanism to do this legally show me

1685
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:36,130
what I gotta do

1686
01:25:33,909 --> 01:25:38,500
so there's all those people doing it as

1687
01:25:36,130 --> 01:25:41,140
well but the limitations are like

1688
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:43,060
Alberta has a ton of stores like what is

1689
01:25:41,140 --> 01:25:46,150
there almost 500 stores in Alberta

1690
01:25:43,060 --> 01:25:48,670
Johnny 184 yeah so Alberta has almost

1691
01:25:46,149 --> 01:25:50,879
500 I don't think the rest of Canada has

1692
01:25:48,670 --> 01:25:52,829
500

1693
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:55,590
at this point in time so there are spots

1694
01:25:52,829 --> 01:25:57,359
where it's not an enough yet like it

1695
01:25:55,590 --> 01:26:01,500
shouldn't be so limited like to have

1696
01:25:57,359 --> 01:26:03,359
commas less than 25 in Ontario right so

1697
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:07,289
I mean Ontario could probably use like

1698
01:26:03,359 --> 01:26:09,960
two thousand I'm probably four thousand

1699
01:26:07,289 --> 01:26:11,670
two hundred there you go like so that

1700
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:13,970
that's gonna happen don't you think oh

1701
01:26:11,670 --> 01:26:13,970
yeah

1702
01:26:14,819 --> 01:26:21,059
so the the the bet that these companies

1703
01:26:17,369 --> 01:26:23,849
made maybe it's just slower of just a

1704
01:26:21,060 --> 01:26:27,180
longer timeline and just you know

1705
01:26:23,850 --> 01:26:30,660
fraught with you know regulation which

1706
01:26:27,180 --> 01:26:32,550
means that it needs to be it needs to go

1707
01:26:30,659 --> 01:26:34,619
through the government I mean it's the

1708
01:26:32,550 --> 01:26:36,720
same thing in the states I mean IIIi

1709
01:26:34,619 --> 01:26:39,569
don't know I mean again just trying to

1710
01:26:36,720 --> 01:26:41,039
get a report card of how it's going in

1711
01:26:39,569 --> 01:26:45,299
Canada cuz I could tell you how it's

1712
01:26:41,039 --> 01:26:47,460
going here you know right yeah of course

1713
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:49,829
well it's uh it's not going to two

1714
01:26:47,460 --> 01:26:51,090
differently except that it is federal so

1715
01:26:49,829 --> 01:26:52,859
it's a little bit differently in the

1716
01:26:51,090 --> 01:26:54,659
sense of you know anywhere in the

1717
01:26:52,859 --> 01:26:57,149
country and then there's also you know

1718
01:26:54,659 --> 01:27:00,420
medical federal but there's also wreck

1719
01:26:57,149 --> 01:27:01,739
at all use federal and there are both

1720
01:27:00,420 --> 01:27:02,670
different things they kind of have

1721
01:27:01,739 --> 01:27:05,550
different rules

1722
01:27:02,670 --> 01:27:09,230
adult use rules don't really apply to

1723
01:27:05,550 --> 01:27:12,150
the people who have MMPR or licenses

1724
01:27:09,229 --> 01:27:14,609
like a medical license whether it's for

1725
01:27:12,149 --> 01:27:17,429
growing possessive smoking or be able to

1726
01:27:14,609 --> 01:27:19,229
yeah possessing but pretty much if your

1727
01:27:17,430 --> 01:27:20,789
medical I mean like certain places if

1728
01:27:19,229 --> 01:27:23,009
you recreation you can't smoke but I'm

1729
01:27:20,789 --> 01:27:24,899
medical I'm pretty much allowed to at a

1730
01:27:23,010 --> 01:27:26,550
certain point for sure yeah but a

1731
01:27:24,899 --> 01:27:28,679
perfect example Johnny B would be a

1732
01:27:26,550 --> 01:27:32,430
recreational user is gonna have to have

1733
01:27:28,680 --> 01:27:34,680
that rec jar with the herb in it sealed

1734
01:27:32,430 --> 01:27:37,200
in the trunk of their car and you could

1735
01:27:34,680 --> 01:27:40,369
have your [ __ ] in a bag in a bag in the

1736
01:27:37,199 --> 01:27:43,019
backseat out of reach great great yes

1737
01:27:40,369 --> 01:27:44,849
it's a little bit different so yeah

1738
01:27:43,020 --> 01:27:46,410
accidentally think of those things and

1739
01:27:44,850 --> 01:27:48,690
we have to talk more about that because

1740
01:27:46,409 --> 01:27:50,130
if you are not medically and has to come

1741
01:27:48,689 --> 01:27:52,769
to the container that you purchased it

1742
01:27:50,130 --> 01:27:54,569
in it cannot be it's gotta be in your

1743
01:27:52,770 --> 01:27:56,670
trunk we treat it you know worse than

1744
01:27:54,569 --> 01:27:57,779
alcohol should be in a safe probably he

1745
01:27:56,670 --> 01:28:03,039
knows that's what they're trying to do

1746
01:27:57,779 --> 01:28:06,829
but yeah drug six chunk six

1747
01:28:03,039 --> 01:28:09,319
let's say okay you have a little plastic

1748
01:28:06,829 --> 01:28:12,949
container or whenever it came in you

1749
01:28:09,319 --> 01:28:15,109
break open the time stamp you open it up

1750
01:28:12,949 --> 01:28:17,059
you take all their about you put your

1751
01:28:15,109 --> 01:28:23,210
herb in there how would they know

1752
01:28:17,060 --> 01:28:27,100
Oh God Sam you know everybody's walking

1753
01:28:23,210 --> 01:28:27,100
around with a little container for their

1754
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:42,230
on that for certain provinces are opting

1755
01:28:39,380 --> 01:28:44,119
out yeah but I'm sure there could be a

1756
01:28:42,229 --> 01:28:47,509
fight to the Charter because it's like

1757
01:28:44,119 --> 01:28:49,099
it is a federal like across the board

1758
01:28:47,510 --> 01:28:51,020
and it's not like provinces have

1759
01:28:49,100 --> 01:28:53,570
thoughts too you know like we're not

1760
01:28:51,020 --> 01:28:55,130
going to allow like medical or wreck or

1761
01:28:53,569 --> 01:28:56,949
a don't use in our province it's like

1762
01:28:55,130 --> 01:29:00,560
are you kidding me like the Charter is

1763
01:28:56,949 --> 01:29:03,559
really pretty simple and every time we

1764
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:06,080
go to the Charter to say hey you can't

1765
01:29:03,560 --> 01:29:09,770
like take away home grows or whatever we

1766
01:29:06,079 --> 01:29:11,569
we win we've never lost those it's just

1767
01:29:09,770 --> 01:29:13,250
like these little baby steps forward

1768
01:29:11,569 --> 01:29:15,859
it's not ever really going super far

1769
01:29:13,250 --> 01:29:20,479
backwards it's always just little steps

1770
01:29:15,859 --> 01:29:23,689
forward so Marcus is there cities in the

1771
01:29:20,479 --> 01:29:29,839
provinces in Canada which don't do

1772
01:29:23,689 --> 01:29:32,079
alcohol I don't think so I don't think

1773
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:32,079
so

1774
01:29:36,699 --> 01:29:41,809
it's possible they might have their own

1775
01:29:39,229 --> 01:29:45,859
internal sort of rules that they meth is

1776
01:29:41,810 --> 01:29:48,140
okay but no alcohol I think I'd say hold

1777
01:29:45,859 --> 01:29:50,059
back on both of them personally yeah I'm

1778
01:29:48,140 --> 01:29:53,090
all yeah I'm just out just a joke folks

1779
01:29:50,060 --> 01:29:54,800
oh I know I'm just joking oh wait I see

1780
01:29:53,090 --> 01:30:00,640
someone else is coming into the room

1781
01:29:54,800 --> 01:30:00,640
it's our good friend Jack hello jack

1782
01:30:01,899 --> 01:30:07,388
hello

1783
01:30:03,609 --> 01:30:10,509
we all win Simon where's John well I'm

1784
01:30:07,389 --> 01:30:12,489
sure jack will figure out his hey Deb

1785
01:30:10,510 --> 01:30:14,829
can you get can you kind of give us like

1786
01:30:12,488 --> 01:30:18,218
a sort of like a report card on how

1787
01:30:14,829 --> 01:30:21,340
regulations going in Cali I mean are are

1788
01:30:18,219 --> 01:30:26,100
things never go according to plan but

1789
01:30:21,340 --> 01:30:28,449
I'm sure they could go a lot smoother

1790
01:30:26,100 --> 01:30:31,030
well I recently became a cannabis

1791
01:30:28,448 --> 01:30:37,000
commissioner on our cannabis Regulatory

1792
01:30:31,029 --> 01:30:38,979
Commission here in government person now

1793
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:43,090
so that's kind of cool and it is fun to

1794
01:30:38,979 --> 01:30:45,339
see how citizens themselves can help

1795
01:30:43,090 --> 01:30:46,779
mold the regulations we are the experts

1796
01:30:45,340 --> 01:30:51,130
right so we should be in there getting

1797
01:30:46,779 --> 01:30:53,710
our opinions heard so things happening

1798
01:30:51,130 --> 01:30:55,630
locally one of the cities I think we

1799
01:30:53,710 --> 01:30:58,948
probably are one of the cities that have

1800
01:30:55,630 --> 01:31:00,789
more licenses than anybody else

1801
01:30:58,948 --> 01:31:03,129
unfortunately we also have the highest

1802
01:31:00,789 --> 01:31:04,689
tax rate or one of the highest tax rates

1803
01:31:03,130 --> 01:31:06,699
in the whole state although it just

1804
01:31:04,689 --> 01:31:08,559
changed and then they made this

1805
01:31:06,698 --> 01:31:11,079
complicated way to get a rebate so you

1806
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:15,580
can you can get your taxes rebate if

1807
01:31:11,079 --> 01:31:17,649
you're supporting local businesses no

1808
01:31:15,579 --> 01:31:20,380
they realize that that's driving

1809
01:31:17,649 --> 01:31:29,469
producers like out to other places or

1810
01:31:20,380 --> 01:31:32,980
they just don't care on the traditional

1811
01:31:29,469 --> 01:31:34,480
market sales at dispensaries yeah we

1812
01:31:32,979 --> 01:31:36,569
have the reputation of having high

1813
01:31:34,479 --> 01:31:38,738
priced cannabis

1814
01:31:36,569 --> 01:31:42,698
there's a bit of a race to the bottom

1815
01:31:38,738 --> 01:31:46,238
where here's a here's the story in

1816
01:31:42,698 --> 01:31:48,638
Oakland we have about ten dispensaries

1817
01:31:46,238 --> 01:31:51,129
there's probably three only three of us

1818
01:31:48,639 --> 01:31:52,779
can manage to be locally owned everybody

1819
01:31:51,130 --> 01:31:56,650
else is a big multi-state or

1820
01:31:52,779 --> 01:31:59,198
multinational company and and they they

1821
01:31:56,649 --> 01:32:00,939
are often you know they've got Oakland

1822
01:31:59,198 --> 01:32:02,678
in the portfolio they can afford to lose

1823
01:32:00,939 --> 01:32:04,658
money for the period of time that we're

1824
01:32:02,679 --> 01:32:06,850
in right now so they're doing this race

1825
01:32:04,658 --> 01:32:08,979
to the bottom on pricing that really

1826
01:32:06,850 --> 01:32:10,539
affects people like us we cannot race to

1827
01:32:08,979 --> 01:32:12,359
the bottom and in fact we won't race to

1828
01:32:10,539 --> 01:32:14,909
the bottom so so

1829
01:32:12,359 --> 01:32:16,529
have to compete based on delivery just

1830
01:32:14,909 --> 01:32:19,349
those old-fashioned values like all of

1831
01:32:16,529 --> 01:32:21,059
us support kindness and community peace

1832
01:32:19,350 --> 01:32:23,430
like selling weed and we've got the best

1833
01:32:21,060 --> 01:32:26,160
cannabis around so that's great

1834
01:32:23,430 --> 01:32:29,130
I mean quality always wins right when it

1835
01:32:26,159 --> 01:32:33,210
comes you know you know I know what

1836
01:32:29,130 --> 01:32:35,640
happened for a while there was all this

1837
01:32:33,210 --> 01:32:38,609
shock and dazzle about these Apple store

1838
01:32:35,640 --> 01:32:40,980
style dispensaries but when people went

1839
01:32:38,609 --> 01:32:42,599
there they're just like this was about

1840
01:32:40,979 --> 01:32:46,349
marijuana you know what I mean like

1841
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:48,000
they're trained to marijuana so the

1842
01:32:46,350 --> 01:32:50,910
consumers I think are starting to come

1843
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:53,699
back to the legacy shops and the legacy

1844
01:32:50,909 --> 01:32:55,439
products but here's the problem like I

1845
01:32:53,699 --> 01:32:58,559
said most of most of my peers have had a

1846
01:32:55,439 --> 01:33:01,529
sellout to multinationals they don't

1847
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:03,450
have the way to survive right now and

1848
01:33:01,529 --> 01:33:06,359
that's what happening the Canadian

1849
01:33:03,449 --> 01:33:08,909
market and all those evaluations and the

1850
01:33:06,359 --> 01:33:10,439
crash that resulted from it affected

1851
01:33:08,909 --> 01:33:12,899
people like us because now the good

1852
01:33:10,439 --> 01:33:14,569
people can get funding and the only

1853
01:33:12,899 --> 01:33:16,829
people that have funding or big

1854
01:33:14,569 --> 01:33:18,929
multinationals so I mean we're just

1855
01:33:16,829 --> 01:33:22,019
basically like we just got a walk

1856
01:33:18,930 --> 01:33:25,619
through fire stick to the values and in

1857
01:33:22,020 --> 01:33:35,940
sort of rebuild the industry again what

1858
01:33:25,619 --> 01:33:38,579
used to be biggest need in the industry

1859
01:33:35,939 --> 01:33:41,519
might actually be teaching the

1860
01:33:38,579 --> 01:33:44,369
multinationals how to grow good weed

1861
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:46,080
amen yeah well they need that but as

1862
01:33:44,369 --> 01:33:48,659
Debbie was saying the thing that they're

1863
01:33:46,079 --> 01:33:50,369
missing is the human element the one to

1864
01:33:48,659 --> 01:33:52,710
one the whole reason we got into this

1865
01:33:50,369 --> 01:33:55,019
was to help people and we helped them by

1866
01:33:52,710 --> 01:33:56,699
talking to them one on one we had all

1867
01:33:55,020 --> 01:33:58,650
these different types of genetics

1868
01:33:56,699 --> 01:34:00,859
available to them but we didn't know how

1869
01:33:58,649 --> 01:34:03,089
to communicate so we had to learn and

1870
01:34:00,859 --> 01:34:06,449
teach others how to communicate

1871
01:34:03,090 --> 01:34:09,260
effectively and that as still as what

1872
01:34:06,449 --> 01:34:12,329
Debbie was speaking toward before the

1873
01:34:09,260 --> 01:34:13,860
multinational corporations are they

1874
01:34:12,329 --> 01:34:16,769
don't necessarily have the hands-on

1875
01:34:13,859 --> 01:34:22,168
training or the deep understanding of

1876
01:34:16,770 --> 01:34:25,590
the training that people watch when

1877
01:34:22,168 --> 01:34:28,319
I'm Boop on one questions you know we've

1878
01:34:25,590 --> 01:34:29,699
got 20 years of doing this and you know

1879
01:34:28,319 --> 01:34:31,078
hope to have even helped teach me how to

1880
01:34:29,698 --> 01:34:33,799
do it you know it's one of the many

1881
01:34:31,078 --> 01:34:36,058
reasons that we continue to this day to

1882
01:34:33,800 --> 01:34:38,579
affect change that's still done one on

1883
01:34:36,059 --> 01:34:41,939
one you know people are still curious we

1884
01:34:38,578 --> 01:34:44,069
had a large influx after you know 64

1885
01:34:41,939 --> 01:34:45,959
past of a whole bunch of people who

1886
01:34:44,069 --> 01:34:49,018
didn't understand what these products

1887
01:34:45,958 --> 01:34:51,779
are but now they do and they also see

1888
01:34:49,019 --> 01:34:54,929
what they cost and the over taxation has

1889
01:34:51,779 --> 01:34:58,828
driven the underground market also the

1890
01:34:54,929 --> 01:35:01,949
slow rollout by the state as well as the

1891
01:34:58,828 --> 01:35:04,738
steep cost to actually get into the

1892
01:35:01,948 --> 01:35:07,049
business or maintain your business all

1893
01:35:04,738 --> 01:35:09,738
those series of realities we're

1894
01:35:07,050 --> 01:35:12,510
challenging prior and now add in the

1895
01:35:09,738 --> 01:35:15,118
reality that we're all facing you know

1896
01:35:12,510 --> 01:35:18,780
because the illegal market that we all

1897
01:35:15,118 --> 01:35:21,478
were in proliferated from is definitely

1898
01:35:18,779 --> 01:35:23,550
doing much better than the legal market

1899
01:35:21,479 --> 01:35:26,309
hands down due to the over taxation and

1900
01:35:23,550 --> 01:35:28,229
no matter what amount of talking that we

1901
01:35:26,309 --> 01:35:31,529
do at the state level it just is all

1902
01:35:28,229 --> 01:35:33,749
talk and the more talk still allows the

1903
01:35:31,529 --> 01:35:36,029
you know the illicit market to continue

1904
01:35:33,748 --> 01:35:38,248
to be out there which you know can't

1905
01:35:36,029 --> 01:35:41,518
speak ill of love it appreciate it but

1906
01:35:38,248 --> 01:35:44,639
at the same time the legal market hasn't

1907
01:35:41,519 --> 01:35:47,458
had its chance or ability to step in and

1908
01:35:44,639 --> 01:35:49,529
as Debbie spoke to prior the reality is

1909
01:35:47,458 --> 01:35:52,918
is a lot of people decided it was

1910
01:35:49,529 --> 01:35:55,259
quicker to sell out and get out and the

1911
01:35:52,918 --> 01:35:57,090
industry has been picked clean of solid

1912
01:35:55,260 --> 01:36:00,059
good people who were in it with a good

1913
01:35:57,090 --> 01:36:01,409
heart and there's a major proliferation

1914
01:36:00,059 --> 01:36:03,239
of a whole bunch of people who don't

1915
01:36:01,408 --> 01:36:06,988
know what they're doing that can fill

1916
01:36:03,238 --> 01:36:09,118
suits very effectively but have no idea

1917
01:36:06,988 --> 01:36:12,148
how to communicate effectively or the

1918
01:36:09,118 --> 01:36:14,158
history that we come from or all the

1919
01:36:12,149 --> 01:36:16,019
hard work and realities that we've all

1920
01:36:14,158 --> 01:36:18,388
put in through our own blood sweat and

1921
01:36:16,019 --> 01:36:20,579
tears and you know many a nights waking

1922
01:36:18,389 --> 01:36:23,458
up in panics no you know it's the

1923
01:36:20,578 --> 01:36:25,948
realities that you know I'm not saying

1924
01:36:23,458 --> 01:36:28,050
pity as poor us it's just this is the

1925
01:36:25,948 --> 01:36:29,759
reality of where we are currently it's

1926
01:36:28,050 --> 01:36:32,760
going to change because it was different

1927
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:35,940
as we say currently it's not 2016

1928
01:36:32,760 --> 01:36:38,550
anymore which is a major real

1929
01:36:35,939 --> 01:36:40,469
for a lot of us because back then we

1930
01:36:38,550 --> 01:36:42,329
could still deal with I was dealing with

1931
01:36:40,469 --> 01:36:45,060
individual farmers so I could get and

1932
01:36:42,329 --> 01:36:47,819
give feedback to the farmer directly now

1933
01:36:45,060 --> 01:36:50,520
in the absence completely of that with

1934
01:36:47,819 --> 01:36:52,889
dealing with distributors the majority

1935
01:36:50,520 --> 01:36:55,500
of pot that I see is still two to three

1936
01:36:52,890 --> 01:37:00,000
price points higher than but we would

1937
01:36:55,500 --> 01:37:03,000
have put at prior to 2018 so the loss of

1938
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:07,198
that availability of unique genetics is

1939
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:10,380
also it's become a reality of everyone

1940
01:37:07,198 --> 01:37:12,210
has the same products period and so you

1941
01:37:10,380 --> 01:37:15,119
just have to regionally shop there's no

1942
01:37:12,210 --> 01:37:17,310
uniqueness that used to drive people to

1943
01:37:15,119 --> 01:37:19,409
certain locations because ie they had a

1944
01:37:17,310 --> 01:37:21,660
specific genetic they had a specific

1945
01:37:19,409 --> 01:37:23,819
type of service now everybody offers

1946
01:37:21,659 --> 01:37:26,039
pretty much the same services in the

1947
01:37:23,819 --> 01:37:29,279
same products you know the differences

1948
01:37:26,039 --> 01:37:31,560
of course no lounges are the new front

1949
01:37:29,279 --> 01:37:34,529
which debbie has one I'm in the midst of

1950
01:37:31,560 --> 01:37:36,930
moving into a larger location I just got

1951
01:37:34,529 --> 01:37:39,960
it passed in the City of Berkeley to

1952
01:37:36,930 --> 01:37:41,430
allow for lounges here and thank you Deb

1953
01:37:39,960 --> 01:37:44,359
you for coming out and speaking before

1954
01:37:41,430 --> 01:37:47,039
the City Council it still takes 20 years

1955
01:37:44,359 --> 01:37:49,500
later you still have to be active in

1956
01:37:47,039 --> 01:37:51,180
your community and listen and listen to

1957
01:37:49,500 --> 01:37:53,579
your City Council and when things come

1958
01:37:51,180 --> 01:37:56,130
up you have to activate your base and

1959
01:37:53,579 --> 01:37:58,319
come out and speak and the issues that

1960
01:37:56,130 --> 01:38:01,850
we had a whole bunch of anti-smoking

1961
01:37:58,319 --> 01:38:05,609
people show up that sparked all kinds of

1962
01:38:01,850 --> 01:38:08,850
shenanigans and scared people with all

1963
01:38:05,609 --> 01:38:10,829
kinds of hoopla but fortunately we had a

1964
01:38:08,850 --> 01:38:14,130
well balanced and a whole bunch of

1965
01:38:10,829 --> 01:38:16,260
informed people as well as experts who

1966
01:38:14,130 --> 01:38:19,159
came out and spoke very eloquently on

1967
01:38:16,260 --> 01:38:21,840
the issue and the city understood it so

1968
01:38:19,159 --> 01:38:23,488
we've got it now and Berkeley and

1969
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:25,800
hopefully in the future when we get our

1970
01:38:23,488 --> 01:38:28,049
new location that'll be open but there's

1971
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:30,869
other locations all over the state that

1972
01:38:28,050 --> 01:38:33,180
do not have that access and you know

1973
01:38:30,869 --> 01:38:35,460
hearing how you lost it in Canada you

1974
01:38:33,180 --> 01:38:37,170
know they shut down how many lounges but

1975
01:38:35,460 --> 01:38:40,500
they didn't replace them with any other

1976
01:38:37,170 --> 01:38:42,930
lounges did they there's no one I will

1977
01:38:40,500 --> 01:38:44,550
say this is the state considering it in

1978
01:38:42,930 --> 01:38:47,470
any way shape or form or is it just

1979
01:38:44,550 --> 01:38:50,920
considered a verboten desk oh there is

1980
01:38:47,470 --> 01:38:54,190
there is um Alberta is actually looking

1981
01:38:50,920 --> 01:38:55,510
at doing this it's very good to see that

1982
01:38:54,189 --> 01:38:57,879
they're actually looking at putting in

1983
01:38:55,510 --> 01:39:00,730
lounges and hopefully we'll see that

1984
01:38:57,880 --> 01:39:02,170
soon and I think that will really change

1985
01:39:00,729 --> 01:39:04,329
it for the industry but their type of

1986
01:39:02,170 --> 01:39:07,000
lounges is actually here's what the

1987
01:39:04,329 --> 01:39:09,729
proposal you get this so the proposals

1988
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:12,189
are that you can consume cannabis with

1989
01:39:09,729 --> 01:39:14,259
alcohol in the same venue you can get

1990
01:39:12,189 --> 01:39:17,169
Summa just in a place where you can only

1991
01:39:14,260 --> 01:39:19,930
eat it or you can the third one was to

1992
01:39:17,170 --> 01:39:22,390
have it say a bar typesetting and on one

1993
01:39:19,930 --> 01:39:24,039
side you can consume cannabis by eating

1994
01:39:22,390 --> 01:39:25,840
it in the pump like a window and on the

1995
01:39:24,039 --> 01:39:27,010
other side you could drink so this is

1996
01:39:25,840 --> 01:39:29,050
the way they're if they're saying

1997
01:39:27,010 --> 01:39:32,079
putting in lounges just for eating just

1998
01:39:29,050 --> 01:39:37,409
for animals so people like the beverages

1999
01:39:32,079 --> 01:39:37,409
you know we have this remodeled alcohol

2000
01:39:37,529 --> 01:39:46,889
and we do Oakland doesn't allow on-site

2001
01:39:42,069 --> 01:39:46,889
smoking so you can only do vaporizing

2002
01:39:51,239 --> 01:39:55,389
wonder if they'd be able to vaporize

2003
01:39:53,350 --> 01:39:56,829
they haven't heard that yet but let's

2004
01:39:55,390 --> 01:39:58,600
see what happens they got to do that

2005
01:39:56,829 --> 01:40:00,670
they have to open up some type of like

2006
01:39:58,600 --> 01:40:04,060
places where people can actually enjoy

2007
01:40:00,670 --> 01:40:05,590
and be able to use cannabis freely and

2008
01:40:04,060 --> 01:40:08,289
not just in their confined in their

2009
01:40:05,590 --> 01:40:10,659
homes but not only that we've also seen

2010
01:40:08,289 --> 01:40:13,149
limitation San Francisco you're limited

2011
01:40:10,659 --> 01:40:17,590
to only a half-hour visit to a vape bars

2012
01:40:13,149 --> 01:40:20,349
so which is strange you knows of itself

2013
01:40:17,590 --> 01:40:22,180
but we know back prior to when BPG got

2014
01:40:20,350 --> 01:40:23,890
shut down by the feds we used to have a

2015
01:40:22,180 --> 01:40:25,450
two-hour limit because you would have

2016
01:40:23,890 --> 01:40:27,369
people stay there all day sometimes

2017
01:40:25,449 --> 01:40:30,489
people pass out there's all kinds of

2018
01:40:27,369 --> 01:40:32,590
realities of why you arrived that so are

2019
01:40:30,489 --> 01:40:33,039
y'all limited at any particular time

2020
01:40:32,590 --> 01:40:56,380
based

2021
01:40:33,039 --> 01:40:58,619
Debbi currently no they tried to do that

2022
01:40:56,380 --> 01:40:58,619
without

2023
01:41:01,300 --> 01:41:07,930
they were called speakeasies you can

2024
01:41:04,510 --> 01:41:10,449
only stand an alcohol bar for two hours

2025
01:41:07,930 --> 01:41:13,900
are you kidding me I have people who

2026
01:41:10,449 --> 01:41:17,609
live there all day it's just a practical

2027
01:41:13,899 --> 01:41:17,609
matter we gotta turn seats you know

2047
01:42:24,729 --> 01:42:34,829
gather it's definitely a very good thing

2048
01:42:28,590 --> 01:42:38,260
yeah really good there's only one

2049
01:42:34,829 --> 01:42:42,069
dispensary in Nelson BC at the moment

2050
01:42:38,260 --> 01:42:44,890
and you know the last really good

2051
01:42:42,069 --> 01:42:47,229
medical dispensary got shut down try

2052
01:42:44,890 --> 01:42:49,990
four or five months ago that was one of

2053
01:42:47,229 --> 01:42:53,500
the original medical dispensary aerials

2054
01:42:49,989 --> 01:42:57,010
yeah it was yeah I remember when he

2055
01:42:53,500 --> 01:42:59,020
opened it yeah yeah exactly and he

2056
01:42:57,010 --> 01:43:02,020
really kept it roots the whole time and

2057
01:42:59,020 --> 01:43:03,580
had like an amazing elder group of

2058
01:43:02,020 --> 01:43:06,280
people here and people that really

2059
01:43:03,579 --> 01:43:07,750
relied on him and so it was it's a real

2060
01:43:06,279 --> 01:43:10,029
you know it's a big problem for the

2061
01:43:07,750 --> 01:43:13,000
community so that's terrible hate to

2062
01:43:10,029 --> 01:43:14,689
hear that our compassion Club is still

2063
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:16,969
going I believe in banku

2064
01:43:14,689 --> 01:43:18,710
oh wow it's this it's the one that

2065
01:43:16,969 --> 01:43:21,590
hasn't been touched it's the one that's

2066
01:43:18,710 --> 01:43:24,460
like it's a it's kind of the one that

2067
01:43:21,590 --> 01:43:26,900
like a bunch of our system was designed

2068
01:43:24,460 --> 01:43:29,300
you know from going and learnt like

2069
01:43:26,899 --> 01:43:31,039
people from Ottawa would go and Hillary

2070
01:43:29,300 --> 01:43:32,719
would walk them through the club then

2071
01:43:31,039 --> 01:43:35,899
they'd go back and you know try to come

2072
01:43:32,719 --> 01:43:37,939
up with these different programs that

2073
01:43:35,899 --> 01:43:39,710
we've had over the years but it's still

2074
01:43:37,939 --> 01:43:42,049
going it's the one that hasn't been

2075
01:43:39,710 --> 01:43:44,000
touched and I kind of felt like fils was

2076
01:43:42,050 --> 01:43:46,130
one of those like a true compassion Club

2077
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:50,390
you know different from a dispensary

2078
01:43:46,130 --> 01:43:53,230
yeah um but a very cool model of just

2079
01:43:50,390 --> 01:43:55,310
you know having a whole satellite

2080
01:43:53,229 --> 01:43:57,369
infrastructure set up to support your

2081
01:43:55,310 --> 01:43:59,719
patients beyond just selling them herb

2082
01:43:57,369 --> 01:44:02,510
but taking some of the profit you're

2083
01:43:59,719 --> 01:44:04,460
making and and funding like healers some

2084
01:44:02,510 --> 01:44:06,079
people to be able to sit with the people

2085
01:44:04,460 --> 01:44:08,448
who are coming in and the patients were

2086
01:44:06,079 --> 01:44:10,698
purchasing cannabis for a variety of

2087
01:44:08,448 --> 01:44:14,389
reasons just seemed like a really good

2088
01:44:10,698 --> 01:44:16,939
system to you know create in Canada I

2089
01:44:14,390 --> 01:44:19,190
know and it was that was why it was kind

2090
01:44:16,939 --> 01:44:21,529
of a big deal he felt like he would was

2091
01:44:19,189 --> 01:44:23,948
embodying all that and so and when that

2092
01:44:21,529 --> 01:44:26,179
went away it was it was a big deal and

2093
01:44:23,948 --> 01:44:27,529
yeah it didn't leave anything else in

2094
01:44:26,180 --> 01:44:29,539
the community and with the work that

2095
01:44:27,529 --> 01:44:32,329
John Conroy is doing in the medical

2096
01:44:29,539 --> 01:44:33,619
programs that really do still exist in

2097
01:44:32,329 --> 01:44:36,109
Canada you know you would think that

2098
01:44:33,619 --> 01:44:39,439
there would be some backing backing for

2099
01:44:36,109 --> 01:44:41,299
that but there is local work in the

2100
01:44:39,439 --> 01:44:44,679
community being done with community

2101
01:44:41,300 --> 01:44:46,430
futures and there is some local

2102
01:44:44,680 --> 01:44:48,440
politicians that are coming around

2103
01:44:46,430 --> 01:44:49,750
trying to make something better you know

2104
01:44:48,439 --> 01:44:52,579
we'll see what happens you know

2105
01:44:49,750 --> 01:44:54,500
obviously the system is broken it's it's

2106
01:44:52,579 --> 01:44:55,729
kind of been set up to fail I mean if

2107
01:44:54,500 --> 01:44:58,340
you when you hear the stories what's

2108
01:44:55,729 --> 01:45:00,619
happened in California and all over I

2109
01:44:58,340 --> 01:45:02,719
mean it's when you set up a system like

2110
01:45:00,619 --> 01:45:04,819
that you know it's it's hard to make it

2111
01:45:02,719 --> 01:45:06,859
work so and it's not working and it's

2112
01:45:04,819 --> 01:45:08,869
interesting you know we've been asked to

2113
01:45:06,859 --> 01:45:10,279
be in front of a lot of different

2114
01:45:08,869 --> 01:45:12,109
ministers and talk to different

2115
01:45:10,279 --> 01:45:14,448
politicians who are putting the laws

2116
01:45:12,109 --> 01:45:16,939
together and they keep having us at

2117
01:45:14,448 --> 01:45:18,769
these meetings and we go and then they

2118
01:45:16,939 --> 01:45:20,419
just explain the same thing over and

2119
01:45:18,770 --> 01:45:22,400
over again we haven't really heard that

2120
01:45:20,420 --> 01:45:24,500
they wanted to make any changes at all

2121
01:45:22,399 --> 01:45:27,679
so it was like it's almost like they're

2122
01:45:24,500 --> 01:45:28,488
saying do you understand and we say yes

2123
01:45:27,679 --> 01:45:31,399
we

2124
01:45:28,488 --> 01:45:33,698
understand but nothing really changes

2125
01:45:31,399 --> 01:45:36,948
and I think what we're all talking about

2126
01:45:33,698 --> 01:45:41,419
is the homogenized Asian of a culture

2127
01:45:36,948 --> 01:45:43,669
and you know happening because you know

2128
01:45:41,420 --> 01:45:45,889
we're having to let go of quite a bit of

2129
01:45:43,670 --> 01:45:47,599
our cannabis culture because we can't

2130
01:45:45,889 --> 01:45:50,599
necessarily make the funding to continue

2131
01:45:47,599 --> 01:45:52,510
it going forward so you know we see the

2132
01:45:50,599 --> 01:45:57,199
modernization of a lot of different

2133
01:45:52,510 --> 01:45:59,659
areas you know that become happened in

2134
01:45:57,198 --> 01:46:02,029
midwifery it happens in all different

2135
01:45:59,658 --> 01:46:03,558
types of Licensing so hopefully when

2136
01:46:02,029 --> 01:46:05,090
they get together with us next in the

2137
01:46:03,559 --> 01:46:07,639
ministry needs with us they'll be

2138
01:46:05,090 --> 01:46:09,650
willing to listen to what we have to say

2139
01:46:07,639 --> 01:46:13,880
to make some changes so that we can get

2140
01:46:09,649 --> 01:46:16,460
some licensing going here in BC sure

2141
01:46:13,880 --> 01:46:18,800
100% that would be a very very good

2142
01:46:16,460 --> 01:46:20,328
thing I've always felt like everything

2143
01:46:18,800 --> 01:46:22,909
that we don't like about this system

2144
01:46:20,328 --> 01:46:25,549
people continue like civil disobedience

2145
01:46:22,908 --> 01:46:27,558
is still occurring in a variety of ways

2146
01:46:25,550 --> 01:46:30,288
and people are doing what they need to

2147
01:46:27,559 --> 01:46:32,480
do to sort of push it over the finish

2148
01:46:30,288 --> 01:46:34,399
line we always seem to have the Charter

2149
01:46:32,479 --> 01:46:36,589
on our side so if you really have to

2150
01:46:34,399 --> 01:46:39,319
like take it right over the finish line

2151
01:46:36,590 --> 01:46:40,610
it's like man Conroy's done it before

2152
01:46:39,319 --> 01:46:43,849
he'll do it again

2153
01:46:40,609 --> 01:46:49,429
you know like he was bred for this this

2154
01:46:43,849 --> 01:46:52,869
work yeah I think that can you hear me

2155
01:46:49,429 --> 01:46:56,658
all right Marcus now he's a little demon

2156
01:46:52,868 --> 01:47:00,589
since since the last time that that I

2157
01:46:56,658 --> 01:47:03,589
was on here we've been able to do to do

2158
01:47:00,590 --> 01:47:06,288
a few things in terms of attaining a

2159
01:47:03,590 --> 01:47:09,828
space where we could actually um grow

2160
01:47:06,288 --> 01:47:12,109
the memberships medicine because the CSU

2161
01:47:09,828 --> 01:47:15,139
approached me through the chief medical

2162
01:47:12,109 --> 01:47:17,238
officer here and said that they didn't

2163
01:47:15,139 --> 01:47:19,368
like us being in a grey space they

2164
01:47:17,238 --> 01:47:23,029
didn't like us buying in a grey space

2165
01:47:19,368 --> 01:47:28,069
and so I proposed to them that we use

2166
01:47:23,029 --> 01:47:29,960
the AC NPR's of our membership to start

2167
01:47:28,069 --> 01:47:32,808
a global for them so that we didn't have

2168
01:47:29,960 --> 01:47:33,828
to find a great space and they asked me

2169
01:47:32,809 --> 01:47:35,960
they said how long do you think that

2170
01:47:33,828 --> 01:47:38,139
would take you and I said I don't know

2171
01:47:35,960 --> 01:47:41,239
probably six to nine months to get

2172
01:47:38,139 --> 01:47:43,309
something going and

2173
01:47:41,238 --> 01:47:45,049
because of the climate of affairs we've

2174
01:47:43,309 --> 01:47:47,659
been able to find many turnkey

2175
01:47:45,050 --> 01:47:48,769
operations that people are willing to

2176
01:47:47,658 --> 01:47:53,598
walk away from

2177
01:47:48,769 --> 01:47:55,248
so the CSU said we were at the bottom of

2178
01:47:53,599 --> 01:47:57,498
the list like the wood that we should

2179
01:47:55,248 --> 01:47:59,238
expect them to come see us when they've

2180
01:47:57,498 --> 01:48:02,988
closed every other dispensary here in

2181
01:47:59,238 --> 01:48:05,959
Victoria which there are still a few

2182
01:48:02,988 --> 01:48:09,828
open so we know we have this element of

2183
01:48:05,960 --> 01:48:12,069
time where we they're letting us proceed

2184
01:48:09,828 --> 01:48:15,049
without a license I'm applying for a

2185
01:48:12,069 --> 01:48:18,380
type of discipline called health

2186
01:48:15,050 --> 01:48:21,320
services including cannabis the goal

2187
01:48:18,380 --> 01:48:23,868
with my needle exchange and my safe and

2188
01:48:21,319 --> 01:48:26,719
safe injection site safe inhalation site

2189
01:48:23,868 --> 01:48:28,130
for other types of put other types of

2190
01:48:26,719 --> 01:48:30,019
drugs and this is why they let me

2191
01:48:28,130 --> 01:48:32,319
continue to move forward is because of

2192
01:48:30,019 --> 01:48:35,719
the fact there's an opioid crisis and

2193
01:48:32,319 --> 01:48:37,189
with the cannabis giveaway that we do

2194
01:48:35,719 --> 01:48:39,230
into the street community we've been

2195
01:48:37,189 --> 01:48:42,078
able to prove that we can actually lower

2196
01:48:39,229 --> 01:48:45,078
the total of overdoses that happen to

2197
01:48:42,078 --> 01:48:46,819
people who use street drugs so I don't

2198
01:48:45,078 --> 01:48:49,299
think they really want to come play with

2199
01:48:46,819 --> 01:48:52,009
our service because we're kind of like

2200
01:48:49,300 --> 01:48:54,079
Hillary but we don't try to make money

2201
01:48:52,010 --> 01:48:56,389
all the money the money it truly is a

2202
01:48:54,078 --> 01:48:58,658
cost recovery service I sell joints for

2203
01:48:56,389 --> 01:49:01,670
two dollars and I don't sell them I

2204
01:48:58,658 --> 01:49:03,018
suggest that you donate $2 to me and if

2205
01:49:01,670 --> 01:49:04,670
you come in and you have no money can

2206
01:49:03,019 --> 01:49:08,030
you say I need adjoined I just give you

2207
01:49:04,670 --> 01:49:09,769
one it's not a dispensary you know it's

2208
01:49:08,029 --> 01:49:12,859
more of just trying to not lose our

2209
01:49:09,769 --> 01:49:15,530
money while we stand there and

2210
01:49:12,859 --> 01:49:17,929
voluntarily give things to people so I

2211
01:49:15,529 --> 01:49:21,429
think we may have found a way to not

2212
01:49:17,929 --> 01:49:24,408
have to get mental pee license to

2213
01:49:21,429 --> 01:49:26,389
interoperate almost as Marvel I always

2214
01:49:24,408 --> 01:49:28,969
speak of it like it's a community it's a

2215
01:49:26,389 --> 01:49:31,219
community if you come into my service

2216
01:49:28,969 --> 01:49:33,828
you'll notice that it's all the same

2217
01:49:31,219 --> 01:49:38,118
people who use the safe injection sites

2218
01:49:33,828 --> 01:49:40,549
on on the Pandora blocks here but I

2219
01:49:38,118 --> 01:49:43,158
don't have like cops and ambulances and

2220
01:49:40,550 --> 01:49:44,960
like all the expensive things they

2221
01:49:43,158 --> 01:49:46,549
required for the safe injection site

2222
01:49:44,960 --> 01:49:49,670
which is only two blocks away from my

2223
01:49:46,550 --> 01:49:52,460
candidate service even though it's all

2224
01:49:49,670 --> 01:49:54,078
the same people because they live in

2225
01:49:52,460 --> 01:49:56,239
their own communities

2226
01:49:54,078 --> 01:49:58,939
I keep and that's what they what's

2227
01:49:56,238 --> 01:50:00,439
really not about just the candidates and

2228
01:49:58,939 --> 01:50:04,039
it was just allowed us a community to

2229
01:50:00,439 --> 01:50:07,089
happen that and look at the outcomes for

2230
01:50:04,039 --> 01:50:10,789
the same people like so I'm just really

2231
01:50:07,090 --> 01:50:13,429
thrilled that that we're starting to get

2232
01:50:10,789 --> 01:50:14,719
the things for our society that I didn't

2233
01:50:13,429 --> 01:50:16,340
think that we would ever be able to have

2234
01:50:14,719 --> 01:50:19,309
you know like we started I was just

2235
01:50:16,340 --> 01:50:20,960
given joints to people you know like one

2236
01:50:19,309 --> 01:50:23,779
day a week giving edibles and joints to

2237
01:50:20,960 --> 01:50:27,260
people out of our office because we

2238
01:50:23,779 --> 01:50:29,479
thought it would be helpful for them for

2239
01:50:27,260 --> 01:50:34,880
them you know and I never really thought

2240
01:50:29,479 --> 01:50:37,279
it would you know we're providing a

2241
01:50:34,880 --> 01:50:39,380
human rights community service it's it's

2242
01:50:37,279 --> 01:50:41,988
really hard to mess with that when

2243
01:50:39,380 --> 01:50:44,599
people are just dying around you you

2244
01:50:41,988 --> 01:50:46,879
know what I mean like how much law can

2245
01:50:44,599 --> 01:50:49,250
you throw at someone when people are

2246
01:50:46,880 --> 01:50:51,650
just falling around you and it's pretty

2247
01:50:49,250 --> 01:50:54,710
severe down in the in the he's part of

2248
01:50:51,649 --> 01:50:56,899
it Coover like a lot of other cities but

2249
01:50:54,710 --> 01:50:58,489
you know I I commend you thank you so

2250
01:50:56,899 --> 01:51:00,649
much you know for putting that that

2251
01:50:58,488 --> 01:51:02,899
together and if there's anything that's

2252
01:51:00,649 --> 01:51:05,000
going to help that area and those people

2253
01:51:02,899 --> 01:51:07,789
and not community down there it's

2254
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:11,359
definitely cannabis so thank you so much

2255
01:51:07,789 --> 01:51:13,448
for continuing to offer cannabis to that

2256
01:51:11,359 --> 01:51:17,058
group of people it's just so incredibly

2257
01:51:13,448 --> 01:51:19,098
yeah really lucky to be able to be

2258
01:51:17,059 --> 01:51:23,119
included with all of that kind of heavy

2259
01:51:19,099 --> 01:51:25,730
weights that are here because you know

2260
01:51:23,118 --> 01:51:27,889
then and I feel really excited to to be

2261
01:51:25,729 --> 01:51:30,828
able to actually to go back and do

2262
01:51:27,889 --> 01:51:32,090
something that I know like that I

2263
01:51:30,828 --> 01:51:33,920
thought I would never have connection to

2264
01:51:32,090 --> 01:51:35,960
again to be able to garden and do that

2265
01:51:33,920 --> 01:51:39,550
and almost nourish and that is for the

2266
01:51:35,960 --> 01:51:41,689
Soul and I think that's the next part

2267
01:51:39,550 --> 01:51:44,809
that I want to try to sell the

2268
01:51:41,689 --> 01:51:47,569
government on it's like I want to create

2269
01:51:44,809 --> 01:51:49,760
a therapeutic area so all those all the

2270
01:51:47,569 --> 01:51:51,558
people who are part of the membership

2271
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:53,719
can actually come in and water a plant

2272
01:51:51,559 --> 01:51:55,219
during on take a leaf you know do things

2273
01:51:53,719 --> 01:51:58,460
to be around plants that are healthy

2274
01:51:55,219 --> 01:52:01,279
because honestly that that's the only

2275
01:51:58,460 --> 01:52:03,980
reason that that I'm not like one of

2276
01:52:01,279 --> 01:52:06,170
them you know I mean is really is is I

2277
01:52:03,979 --> 01:52:12,019
got over those things using kind of

2278
01:52:06,170 --> 01:52:14,420
and and I changed my create a therapy

2279
01:52:12,020 --> 01:52:16,910
program for people to come in off the

2280
01:52:14,420 --> 01:52:19,520
streets and grow the weed yeah so like

2281
01:52:16,909 --> 01:52:21,859
exactly so that if you if you come in

2282
01:52:19,520 --> 01:52:24,890
every day and there was like hey where's

2283
01:52:21,859 --> 01:52:27,349
my I have my daily my daily rather than

2284
01:52:24,890 --> 01:52:29,210
just creating a need and teaching people

2285
01:52:27,350 --> 01:52:31,219
the needs of [ __ ] I would rather

2286
01:52:29,210 --> 01:52:33,198
actually have them participate a little

2287
01:52:31,219 --> 01:52:35,179
bit in it so that when they get may come

2288
01:52:33,198 --> 01:52:37,609
get their donation they feel like they

2289
01:52:35,179 --> 01:52:39,739
participated in making medicine you know

2290
01:52:37,609 --> 01:52:42,349
that's part of the cycle of breaking

2291
01:52:39,738 --> 01:52:45,198
that need that constant addiction is

2292
01:52:42,350 --> 01:52:47,300
[ __ ] need yeah bingos by giving you

2293
01:52:45,198 --> 01:52:49,099
build a community then eventually you'll

2294
01:52:47,300 --> 01:52:50,510
put down a pipe every five minutes

2295
01:52:49,100 --> 01:52:52,190
because you'll be doing every other

2296
01:52:50,510 --> 01:52:53,960
things that a month becomes there we

2297
01:52:52,189 --> 01:52:55,969
half an hour you can realize you know

2298
01:52:53,960 --> 01:52:58,130
maybe you can get away with less of that

2299
01:52:55,969 --> 01:53:00,469
you know what I mean and you can kind of

2300
01:52:58,130 --> 01:53:01,969
you know know how people change our own

2301
01:53:00,469 --> 01:53:04,730
lives instead of telling people that

2302
01:53:01,969 --> 01:53:06,890
they need to change their [ __ ] would you

2303
01:53:04,729 --> 01:53:09,919
have thought how many years ago did I

2304
01:53:06,890 --> 01:53:16,280
even introduced you to Hillary that's

2305
01:53:09,920 --> 01:53:19,190
how I know Hillary yeah man it was

2306
01:53:16,279 --> 01:53:21,289
probably like it was I think it was 1991

2307
01:53:19,189 --> 01:53:22,639
or 1992 because I lived on second and

2308
01:53:21,289 --> 01:53:24,229
commercial and she told me she was gonna

2309
01:53:22,640 --> 01:53:26,900
start slinging weed in the back of the

2310
01:53:24,229 --> 01:53:28,849
hippie shop it's dollars a gram and it's

2311
01:53:26,899 --> 01:53:30,319
a time the prices were thirty two

2312
01:53:28,850 --> 01:53:32,239
hundred dollars a pound so I was like

2313
01:53:30,319 --> 01:53:34,009
Hillary man you're insane like you're

2314
01:53:32,238 --> 01:53:35,599
never gonna get you this you're crazy

2315
01:53:34,010 --> 01:53:38,179
you know no man and I remember having

2316
01:53:35,600 --> 01:53:40,730
these sentence funny arguments with her

2317
01:53:38,179 --> 01:53:42,590
because she would have to pay more than

2318
01:53:40,729 --> 01:53:44,509
the guy who came in and was buying the

2319
01:53:42,590 --> 01:53:46,039
hundred or whatever you know what I mean

2320
01:53:44,510 --> 01:53:48,110
so she was like she was like hilarious

2321
01:53:46,039 --> 01:53:50,029
to me you know a man and then she became

2322
01:53:48,109 --> 01:53:51,948
the most successful person ever I kinda

2323
01:53:50,029 --> 01:53:55,609

okay one thing one thing I wanted to

2336
01:54:24,050 --> 01:54:30,110
mention was when we met with John Conroy

2337
01:54:27,698 --> 01:54:33,558
sometime this winter we were talking

2338
01:54:30,109 --> 01:54:35,630
about a CMP our coops and medical coops

2339
01:54:33,559 --> 01:54:38,900
and the legality of those you know it's

2340
01:54:35,630 --> 01:54:40,639
like recreational and you know the

2341
01:54:38,899 --> 01:54:43,488
federal legalization up here in Canada

2342
01:54:40,639 --> 01:54:45,828
is - you know it was taking over a lot

2343
01:54:43,488 --> 01:54:47,779
of the conversation but what about the

2344
01:54:45,828 --> 01:54:51,049
medical that's continued and I really AM

2345
01:54:47,779 --> 01:54:53,509
in urging people in Canada to start

2346
01:54:51,050 --> 01:54:56,239
looking at you know medical coops

2347
01:54:53,510 --> 01:54:58,820
because they're not really illegal yet

2348
01:54:56,238 --> 01:55:00,708
they're in a gray space and and I said

2349
01:54:58,819 --> 01:55:03,319
to John Conroy what happens if we just

2350
01:55:00,708 --> 01:55:05,300
you know collect medical licenses and we

2351
01:55:03,319 --> 01:55:07,219
put it up on her website is that legal

2352
01:55:05,300 --> 01:55:09,349
he said well it's not illegal so

2353
01:55:07,219 --> 01:55:11,208

01:57:46,220 --> 01:57:52,100
running again and it's going to be

2413
01:57:48,289 --> 01:57:55,189
happening in the context of our farmers

2414
01:57:52,100 --> 01:57:58,400
our manufacturers our processors our

2415
01:57:55,189 --> 01:58:01,939
distributors and our retailers are all

2416
01:57:58,399 --> 01:58:06,589
licensed in the California space here in

2417
01:58:01,939 --> 01:58:10,059
Nevada County and yeah the Gladius

2418
01:58:06,590 --> 01:58:10,060
network is going to be working again

2419
01:58:14,500 --> 01:58:21,829
families yeah I wish the news was better

2420
01:58:18,319 --> 01:58:25,429
about Forrest Silas has been having a

2421
01:58:21,829 --> 01:58:30,680
really hard time and I've seen some I've

2422
01:58:25,430 --> 01:58:34,190
seen forests twice this year Silas has

2423
01:58:30,680 --> 01:58:39,500
been on a helicopter down to either UCSF

2424
01:58:34,189 --> 01:58:45,349
Children's Hospital or Davis three times

2425
01:58:39,500 --> 01:58:46,760
already this year and so yeah but what's

2426
01:58:45,350 --> 01:58:49,700
lovely about what's happening here in

2427
01:58:46,760 --> 01:58:51,530
the county is all of the folks who know

2428
01:58:49,699 --> 01:58:53,539
Forrest and know the situation there

2429
01:58:51,529 --> 01:58:56,149
have stepped up to make it happen

2430
01:58:53,539 --> 01:59:00,050
without him needing to be involved as

2431
01:58:56,149 --> 01:59:01,969
much as he was and again the families

2432
01:59:00,050 --> 01:59:04,159
were starting to be able to provide them

2433
01:59:01,970 --> 01:59:05,900
the products they need and it's really a

2434
01:59:04,159 --> 01:59:08,779
blessing so there is some good news in

2435
01:59:05,899 --> 01:59:10,969
the California space and of course our

2436
01:59:08,779 --> 01:59:12,559
model was always that those families

2437
01:59:10,970 --> 01:59:14,750
would be able to get their products at

2438
01:59:12,560 --> 01:59:16,940
no cost so of course all of the

2439
01:59:14,750 --> 01:59:18,130
licensees with all of the craziness

2440
01:59:16,939 --> 01:59:20,019
that's happening in the

2441
01:59:18,130 --> 01:59:22,510
related market and trying to survive all

2442
01:59:20,020 --> 01:59:25,800
the multinational and multi-state

2443
01:59:22,510 --> 01:59:30,100
operators there in the California space

2444
01:59:25,800 --> 01:59:31,960
here in our county of the weave we have

2445
01:59:30,100 --> 01:59:32,980
people who have stood up and and are

2446
01:59:31,960 --> 01:59:35,470
making that happen

2447
01:59:32,979 --> 01:59:39,549
I had no cost to the establish so that's

2448
01:59:35,470 --> 01:59:42,310
really cool we're still only at 38

2449
01:59:39,550 --> 01:59:46,920
permitted farms in the county and in

2450
01:59:42,310 --> 01:59:52,840
2015 we had 3500 so the cultural

2451
01:59:46,920 --> 01:59:56,649
extinction event is still going on there

2452
01:59:52,840 --> 01:59:58,900
is the CDF a has dropped regulations

2453
01:59:56,649 --> 02:00:01,079
proposed regulations on appellations of

2454
01:59:58,899 --> 02:00:03,250
origin and I think there's a potential

2455
02:00:01,079 --> 02:00:08,319
opportunity there for small farmers

2456
02:00:03,250 --> 02:00:09,970
maybe to survive and that's what all I

2457
02:00:08,319 --> 02:00:12,009
have on the California space but on

2458
02:00:09,970 --> 02:00:17,079
another topic I wanted to let you know

2459
02:00:12,010 --> 02:00:19,060
that I'm gotten busy in Utah the state

2460
02:00:17,079 --> 02:00:25,199
of Utah has created a medical cannabis

2461
02:00:19,060 --> 02:00:28,390
program and long story short I'm

2462
02:00:25,199 --> 02:00:33,099
spending a lot of time at a vertically

2463
02:00:28,390 --> 02:00:35,770
integrated entity in Salt Lake City we

2464
02:00:33,100 --> 02:00:39,190
have the first legal pharmacy he sold

2465
02:00:35,770 --> 02:00:41,800
legal product on Monday but the the

2466
02:00:39,189 --> 02:00:44,589
program there's good things about it and

2467
02:00:41,800 --> 02:00:48,400
bad things about it a real issue lately

2468
02:00:44,590 --> 02:00:51,190
has been that in order to get into the

2469
02:00:48,399 --> 02:00:53,319
pharmacy you have to have a physician's

2470
02:00:51,189 --> 02:00:55,809
recommission recommendation is the first

2471
02:00:53,319 --> 02:00:58,840
step but there's eight steps involved in

2472
02:00:55,810 --> 02:01:01,660
working with the state bureaucracy and

2473
02:00:58,840 --> 02:01:04,930
they they started doing it on March 1st

2474
02:01:01,659 --> 02:01:07,329
and on March 2nd legal sales started so

2475
02:01:04,930 --> 02:01:10,770
of course there was I think there were

2476
02:01:07,329 --> 02:01:12,850
10 cards in the whole state on March 2nd

2477
02:01:10,770 --> 02:01:16,450
and I think they're up to a couple of

2478
02:01:12,850 --> 02:01:18,430
hundred but the the good news is it's

2479
02:01:16,449 --> 02:01:21,729
really focused around medical need there

2480
02:01:18,430 --> 02:01:23,710
is no recreational use of course what

2481
02:01:21,729 --> 02:01:25,719
does that really mean it just means you

2482
02:01:23,710 --> 02:01:28,270
need a doctor's recommendation for some

2483
02:01:25,720 --> 02:01:31,230
condition and the folks that I spoke to

2484
02:01:28,270 --> 02:01:34,860
in the pharmacy most of

2485
02:01:31,229 --> 02:01:36,359
we're experienced users and we're real

2486
02:01:34,859 --> 02:01:41,849
excited at the opportunity to actually

2487
02:01:36,359 --> 02:01:44,929
buy legal product in Utah so that's I

2488
02:01:41,850 --> 02:01:46,920
think a big step in the right direction

2489
02:01:44,930 --> 02:01:50,460
Utah's one of the most conservative

2490
02:01:46,920 --> 02:01:52,109
states in the United States and like all

2491
02:01:50,460 --> 02:01:54,779
of the well I won't get into their

2492
02:01:52,109 --> 02:01:57,899
politics I'll leave it at that

2493
02:01:54,779 --> 02:02:00,449
and I I'm real excited actually at the

2494
02:01:57,899 --> 02:02:03,899
opportunity to do education my focus

2495
02:02:00,449 --> 02:02:05,279
mostly at the pharmacy is education to

2496
02:02:03,899 --> 02:02:06,869
help people understand the

2497
02:02:05,279 --> 02:02:09,809
endocannabinoid system and what it can

2498
02:02:06,869 --> 02:02:12,720
do for people and the fact that it's as

2499
02:02:09,810 --> 02:02:15,090
as much as I personally love the feeling

2500
02:02:12,720 --> 02:02:17,909
of being stoned that's not the whole

2501
02:02:15,090 --> 02:02:21,210
story and it's a really unique

2502
02:02:17,909 --> 02:02:25,880
opportunity to help people understand

2503
02:02:21,210 --> 02:02:30,090
that but it is the cracking of the book

2504
02:02:25,880 --> 02:02:34,770
in the state of California now medical

2505
02:02:30,090 --> 02:02:37,770
users to get it for free and it's tax

2506
02:02:34,770 --> 02:02:41,790
free for the dispensary that's giving it

2507
02:02:37,770 --> 02:02:44,190
to them it's true that law has changed I

2508
02:02:41,789 --> 02:02:47,399
think maybe March 1st was the first day

2509
02:02:44,189 --> 02:02:50,039
because March 1st yeah before that they

2510
02:02:47,399 --> 02:02:51,809
taxed like you saw the paper there was

2511
02:02:50,039 --> 02:02:54,569
no free cannabis at all because you saw

2512
02:02:51,810 --> 02:02:57,600
the pay taxes coefficient X first and

2513
02:02:54,569 --> 02:02:59,759
then excise tax and then I guess

2514
02:02:57,600 --> 02:03:05,400
potentially sales tax on that to give

2515
02:02:59,760 --> 02:03:06,300
anyone free campus that's right yeah

2516
02:03:05,399 --> 02:03:08,489
well I was

2517
02:03:06,300 --> 02:03:11,430
I still donated and didn't stop so I

2518
02:03:08,489 --> 02:03:13,649
paid the the week we found good

2519
02:03:11,430 --> 02:03:16,289
providers who gave us the cannabis for a

2520
02:03:13,649 --> 02:03:17,909
deep discount we were able to still we

2521
02:03:16,289 --> 02:03:20,609
had to still make it as a transaction

2522
02:03:17,909 --> 02:03:23,069
but we still gave away cannabis but this

2523
02:03:20,609 --> 02:03:24,989
law which we worked with many other

2524
02:03:23,069 --> 02:03:26,849
organizations throughout the state of

2525
02:03:24,989 --> 02:03:29,760
California again to stay diligent out

2526
02:03:26,850 --> 02:03:32,430
there people and we changed the law up

2527
02:03:29,760 --> 02:03:34,500
there in Sacramento so we failed prior

2528
02:03:32,430 --> 02:03:36,420
the previous governor gave us kind of

2529
02:03:34,500 --> 02:03:39,510
all the big finger so we had to go back

2530
02:03:36,420 --> 02:03:41,909
and do it again after failing and so

2531
02:03:39,510 --> 02:03:44,430
finally we got it passed so yes it is

2532
02:03:41,909 --> 02:03:45,329
going to be much easier to give away

2533
02:03:44,430 --> 02:03:47,100
cannabis

2534
02:03:45,329 --> 02:03:49,380
again to those that are in need for CH

2535
02:03:47,100 --> 02:03:52,350
is the whole reason we got many of us

2536
02:03:49,380 --> 02:03:55,350
got into this in the first place it was

2537
02:03:52,350 --> 02:03:57,660
pretty ridiculous that dispensary who

2538
02:03:55,350 --> 02:04:01,740
wanted to give care of the Spree to a

2539
02:03:57,659 --> 02:04:04,229
patient have to pay taxes well you have

2540
02:04:01,739 --> 02:04:06,989
to buy it then pay taxes and then give

2541
02:04:04,229 --> 02:04:07,709
then you can give it away yes yeah fun

2542
02:04:06,989 --> 02:04:10,319
times

2543
02:04:07,710 --> 02:04:12,060
I'm HTN I just wanted to reach out to

2544
02:04:10,319 --> 02:04:14,819

2545
02:04:12,060 --> 02:04:16,440

2550
02:04:21,930 --> 02:04:27,060
can go with tax free and there can be

2551
02:04:23,640 --> 02:04:29,579
some donations with minimal you know

2552
02:04:27,060 --> 02:04:31,080
funding back and forth and we're all

2553
02:04:29,579 --> 02:04:32,460
about it we want to hear more about it

2554
02:04:31,079 --> 02:04:35,039
and how we can be helpful and Wade

2555
02:04:32,460 --> 02:04:37,020
absolutely to you in calabria is Network

2556
02:04:35,039 --> 02:04:39,750
we want to continue to support that

2557
02:04:37,020 --> 02:04:42,810
effort you know dem Pierre is the

2558
02:04:39,750 --> 02:04:45,359
largest growing regenerative producing

2559
02:04:42,810 --> 02:04:47,940
flower in the world right now and we're

2560
02:04:45,359 --> 02:04:49,529
all about supporting these kind of

2561
02:04:47,939 --> 02:04:52,069
foundations and these kind of movements

2562
02:04:49,529 --> 02:04:57,029
the number one core value of our mission

2563
02:04:52,069 --> 02:04:58,769
yeah perfect yeah it's brand-new we have

2564
02:04:57,029 --> 02:05:00,359
to figure out ways to how to get this

2565
02:04:58,770 --> 02:05:02,550
whole thing started again I mean except

2566
02:05:00,359 --> 02:05:04,589
in places like Berkeley the City of

2567
02:05:02,550 --> 02:05:06,180
Berkeley actually put in a city law when

2568
02:05:04,590 --> 02:05:07,770
the ordinance was written saying that

2569
02:05:06,180 --> 02:05:10,230
dispensaries had to give away the

2570
02:05:07,770 --> 02:05:13,350
equivalent of 2% of the medical

2571
02:05:10,229 --> 02:05:15,689
marijuana flowers that they sell so yeah

2572
02:05:13,350 --> 02:05:20,490
all the dispensaries have through this

2573
02:05:15,689 --> 02:05:22,849
time the laws are changing so fast

2574
02:05:20,489 --> 02:05:25,679
everywhere the part of our mission

2575
02:05:22,850 --> 02:05:28,200
kellene it's just going to all these

2576
02:05:25,680 --> 02:05:29,850
different bioregions in the world and

2577
02:05:28,199 --> 02:05:31,019
learning the laws and trying to bring

2578
02:05:29,850 --> 02:05:34,110
people together and learn how to

2579
02:05:31,020 --> 02:05:36,030
navigate them so it's like we all live

2580
02:05:34,109 --> 02:05:38,009
in an area that has a certain amount of

2581
02:05:36,029 --> 02:05:40,229
restrictions and regulations on it

2582
02:05:38,010 --> 02:05:42,270
they're different in every area but

2583
02:05:40,229 --> 02:05:44,819
there's also congruence with in every

2584
02:05:42,270 --> 02:05:47,100
area so we're working on creating this

2585
02:05:44,819 --> 02:05:49,349
network you know of lawyers and

2586
02:05:47,100 --> 02:05:50,760
scientists and farmers and all these

2587
02:05:49,350 --> 02:05:53,160
different things that we can all support

2588
02:05:50,760 --> 02:05:55,079
each other and that's the purpose of the

2589
02:05:53,159 --> 02:05:58,170
conferences that we have coming up to

2590
02:05:55,079 --> 02:05:58,979
provide that education to the community

2591
02:05:58,170 --> 02:06:01,350
and to the mass

2592
02:05:58,979 --> 02:06:04,049
which we're doing another conference at

2593
02:06:01,350 --> 02:06:06,960
the heartwood sanctuary and Humboldt in

2594
02:06:04,050 --> 02:06:08,789
May and people can look out for that we

2595
02:06:06,960 --> 02:06:10,380
haven't come out with the exact details

2596
02:06:08,789 --> 02:06:12,720
for the public on that yet but we're

2597
02:06:10,380 --> 02:06:14,220
really excited about it yeah so I'm just

2598
02:06:12,720 --> 02:06:16,980
really quick what that's gonna be is

2599
02:06:14,220 --> 02:06:20,520
that heartwood from April 30th until May

2600
02:06:16,979 --> 02:06:23,669
3rd it's gonna be an unbelievable

2601
02:06:20,520 --> 02:06:25,890
gathering tree over Beltane weekend

2602
02:06:23,670 --> 02:06:28,619
there's going to be almost all of the

2603
02:06:25,890 --> 02:06:31,350
demo farmers and MP r collective members

2604
02:06:28,619 --> 02:06:33,210
that are going to be teaching and we're

2605
02:06:31,350 --> 02:06:35,430
gonna be gathering and and you know one

2606
02:06:33,210 --> 02:06:37,380
thing I'd like to say is that the Dalai

2607
02:06:35,430 --> 02:06:39,119
Lama always told us that we need to

2608
02:06:37,380 --> 02:06:41,190
really learn the rules so we know how to

2609
02:06:39,119 --> 02:06:44,399
break them and I believe that that's

2610
02:06:41,189 --> 02:06:46,679
like one of the most guiding quotes in

2611
02:06:44,399 --> 02:06:48,509
in my life so that's what we're all

2612
02:06:46,680 --> 02:06:51,810
talking about here is how can we learn

2613
02:06:48,510 --> 02:06:53,539
the rules so we can get around them and

2614
02:06:51,810 --> 02:06:55,470
still be able to provide medicine and

2615
02:06:53,539 --> 02:06:56,880
education to the people and that's

2616
02:06:55,470 --> 02:06:58,350
exactly what we're doing within our

2617
02:06:56,880 --> 02:07:00,900
collective and our collective is not

2618
02:06:58,350 --> 02:07:02,280
just like a few people can join if

2619
02:07:00,899 --> 02:07:04,529
you're out there and you're doing

2620
02:07:02,279 --> 02:07:07,079
amazing work and you're growing

2621
02:07:04,529 --> 02:07:08,849
beautiful flower and and you're up there

2622
02:07:07,079 --> 02:07:10,738
trying to change the laws throughout the

2623
02:07:08,850 --> 02:07:13,170
world get a hold of us this is a group

2624
02:07:10,738 --> 02:07:14,939
that you know we're international and

2625
02:07:13,170 --> 02:07:17,250
we're becoming very large and we're

2626
02:07:14,939 --> 02:07:19,259
becoming a really loud voice in this

2627
02:07:17,250 --> 02:07:20,789
cannabis community and it's really an

2628
02:07:19,260 --> 02:07:23,880
exciting time because we're working on

2629
02:07:20,789 --> 02:07:26,609
creating commerce on an international on

2630
02:07:23,880 --> 02:07:28,560
a website for us all so basically we're

2631
02:07:26,609 --> 02:07:31,170
getting people together instead of most

2632
02:07:28,560 --> 02:07:34,080
big commerce on everything outside of

2633
02:07:31,170 --> 02:07:35,909
regulations everything outside of the

2634
02:07:34,079 --> 02:07:38,880
THC market let's get a regenerative

2635
02:07:35,909 --> 02:07:41,279
marketplace going for all the products

2636
02:07:38,880 --> 02:07:43,710
that we have then slowly we can change

2637
02:07:41,279 --> 02:07:45,988
the laws change we can make other

2638
02:07:43,710 --> 02:07:47,789
products available so that's what's

2639
02:07:45,988 --> 02:07:50,369
really exciting about it I mean we did

2640
02:07:47,789 --> 02:07:53,100
we got back from Hawaii and I would like

2641
02:07:50,369 --> 02:07:56,210
to put a shout out to the the Maui

2642
02:07:53,100 --> 02:07:58,560
cannabis guild for one there's there's

2643
02:07:56,210 --> 02:08:00,210
insane things are happening on the

2644
02:07:58,560 --> 02:08:02,610
Hawaiian Islands when it comes to

2645
02:08:00,210 --> 02:08:05,640
genetically modified crops not having to

2646
02:08:02,609 --> 02:08:08,179
do with cannabis so you know Monsanto

2647
02:08:05,640 --> 02:08:11,349
and Syngenta and Matson and horrible

2648
02:08:08,180 --> 02:08:14,829
genetically modified seed companies are

2649
02:08:11,349 --> 02:08:18,489
creating chemical seed on the islands in

2650
02:08:14,828 --> 02:08:21,488
mass and even one months ago on Maui

2651
02:08:18,488 --> 02:08:26,138
they sprayed potatoes with paraquat it

2652
02:08:21,488 --> 02:08:28,629
was an article you can look up paraquat

2653
02:08:26,139 --> 02:08:32,170
potatoes Maui and you can find an

2654
02:08:28,630 --> 02:08:35,139
article on it and they're trying to test

2655
02:08:32,170 --> 02:08:36,670
their crops with these chemicals to see

2656
02:08:35,139 --> 02:08:39,460
if they grow so it's a research and

2657
02:08:36,670 --> 02:08:41,949
development plot and these are banned

2658
02:08:39,460 --> 02:08:44,198
u.s. chemicals that they're openly using

2659
02:08:41,948 --> 02:08:46,479
on fields right now on a tropical island

2660
02:08:44,198 --> 02:08:48,488
in the middle of the ocean is really

2661
02:08:46,479 --> 02:08:50,468
mind-blowing so it's actually more

2662
02:08:48,488 --> 02:08:52,809
important than ever because we all know

2663
02:08:50,469 --> 02:08:55,480
that cannabis has become a catalyst to

2664
02:08:52,810 --> 02:08:57,219
unveiling what's going on in big AG it's

2665
02:08:55,479 --> 02:08:59,408
become a catalyst for unveiling what's

2666
02:08:57,219 --> 02:09:01,599
going on in Big Pharma so it's more

2667
02:08:59,408 --> 02:09:03,789
important than ever that Hawaii

2668
02:09:01,599 --> 02:09:06,190
continues moving forward with their

2669
02:09:03,789 --> 02:09:08,979
cannabis legislation so that a lot of

2670
02:09:06,189 --> 02:09:10,750
these horrible bad illegal practices

2671
02:09:08,979 --> 02:09:13,539
that are going on in the islands can be

2672
02:09:10,750 --> 02:09:15,069
unveiled and we can really see what's

2673
02:09:13,539 --> 02:09:17,139
going on because it will be the first

2674
02:09:15,069 --> 02:09:19,179
time that soil is being tested it will

2675
02:09:17,139 --> 02:09:21,880
be the first time that you know crops

2676
02:09:19,179 --> 02:09:23,618
are being tested so it's it's so

2677
02:09:21,880 --> 02:09:25,868
imperative for all of us to be

2678
02:09:23,618 --> 02:09:28,299
supporting Hawaii legislation and and

2679
02:09:25,868 --> 02:09:30,118
regenerative agriculture is on the move

2680
02:09:28,300 --> 02:09:32,920
there are people are realizing that

2681
02:09:30,118 --> 02:09:35,889
sustainable agriculture or organics is

2682
02:09:32,920 --> 02:09:38,920
not enough we can't sustain land that's

2683
02:09:35,889 --> 02:09:41,170
that's ill we have to regenerate the

2684
02:09:38,920 --> 02:09:44,590
land that's ill so we're working with

2685
02:09:41,170 --> 02:09:46,300
edible food forests people amazing food

2686
02:09:44,590 --> 02:09:48,429
security people what we're saying is if

2687
02:09:46,300 --> 02:09:51,310
everyone can growth let's use cannabis

2688
02:09:48,429 --> 02:09:53,230
as a point of consciousness to catalyze

2689
02:09:51,310 --> 02:09:55,659
ourselves to move forward if we're gonna

2690
02:09:53,229 --> 02:09:58,928
grow for cannabis plants let's grow at

2691
02:09:55,658 --> 02:10:01,479
least four food plants too if all of us

2692
02:09:58,929 --> 02:10:03,340
grow some food in our backyard it takes

2693
02:10:01,479 --> 02:10:05,559
away the need to buy it from the store I

2694
02:10:03,340 --> 02:10:07,090
mean if you go to Hawaii ninety-eight

2695
02:10:05,560 --> 02:10:09,789
percent of the food in the store is

2696
02:10:07,090 --> 02:10:13,960
exactly from from the mainland is from

2697
02:10:09,789 --> 02:10:16,738
Mexico or California so what makes zero

2698
02:10:13,960 --> 02:10:19,029
sense because it's the most lush amazing

2699
02:10:16,738 --> 02:10:20,859
area that can you know all different

2700
02:10:19,029 --> 02:10:23,500
kinds of fruits and vegetables can be

2701
02:10:20,859 --> 02:10:25,389
grown there and there's a beautiful cone

2702
02:10:23,500 --> 02:10:28,720
wait a minute there's a reason why this

2703
02:10:25,390 --> 02:10:31,510
is hard part of it is it's cheaper to

2704
02:10:28,720 --> 02:10:35,079
produce it other where other places the

2705
02:10:31,510 --> 02:10:37,180
second thing is that White's got a

2706
02:10:35,079 --> 02:10:39,609
serious problem with fruit flies I mean

2707
02:10:37,180 --> 02:10:43,310
he can't you can't grow Popeyes there as

2708
02:10:39,609 --> 02:10:45,219
a commercial crop and let's nip

2709
02:10:43,310 --> 02:10:47,949
you

2710
02:10:45,219 --> 02:10:51,039
yeah actually that's untrue Molokai is

2711
02:10:47,948 --> 02:10:53,979
growing a massive amount of papayas and

2712
02:10:51,039 --> 02:10:56,380
also the farmers market are supplying a

2713
02:10:53,979 --> 02:10:57,929
lot of the percentage of the vegetables

2714
02:10:56,380 --> 02:11:01,000
that I actually aren't being registered

2715
02:10:57,930 --> 02:11:03,820
so we went to a lot of the farms and we

2716
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:06,430
we do see that there is viability for

2717
02:11:03,819 --> 02:11:11,619
small farmers one of the reasons why

2718
02:11:06,430 --> 02:11:14,680
they've been on the white without fruit

2719
02:11:11,619 --> 02:11:17,319
flies getting unless it's inside of a

2720
02:11:14,680 --> 02:11:18,760
screened greenhouse well I mean then

2721
02:11:17,319 --> 02:11:20,889
you're saying that you're running that

2722
02:11:18,760 --> 02:11:27,100
risk all over the tropics when that's

2723
02:11:20,890 --> 02:11:30,070
just not totally true why he does well a

2724
02:11:27,100 --> 02:11:32,770
lot of commercial papaya that was grown

2725
02:11:30,069 --> 02:11:35,259
on Molokai we did see a lot of beautiful

2726
02:11:32,770 --> 02:11:37,840
organic fruit that was grown we went to

2727
02:11:35,260 --> 02:11:41,469
a lot of farms and we weren't running

2728
02:11:37,840 --> 02:11:45,789
issues 90% of Warbeck papayas

2729
02:11:41,469 --> 02:11:47,590
commercially grown Hawaii GMO exactly

2730
02:11:45,789 --> 02:11:50,140
and that's the whole entire plain of

2731
02:11:47,590 --> 02:11:52,539
what we're making 90% of all food that

2732
02:11:50,140 --> 02:11:55,410
we're eating not just papayas are coming

2733
02:11:52,539 --> 02:11:58,180
from one or two hybridizations or

2734
02:11:55,409 --> 02:12:00,519
feminization of a food plant that comes

2735
02:11:58,180 --> 02:12:02,710
from the wild the whole entire purpose

2736
02:12:00,520 --> 02:12:04,870
really of what we're saying is go beyond

2737
02:12:02,710 --> 02:12:06,730
the normal papaya that everyone's

2738
02:12:04,869 --> 02:12:10,210
growing where there's lots of different

2739
02:12:06,729 --> 02:12:12,579
papayas in the world so grow a different

2740
02:12:10,210 --> 02:12:14,770
kind of papaya from somewhere else

2741
02:12:12,579 --> 02:12:17,649
there's plenty of natural farmers on

2742
02:12:14,770 --> 02:12:19,570
Hawaii successfully creating their own

2743
02:12:17,649 --> 02:12:23,469
nutrients successfully creating their

2744
02:12:19,569 --> 02:12:26,590
own pest sprays that are growing amazing

2745
02:12:23,469 --> 02:12:28,869
very nutritious food and the point of of

2746
02:12:26,590 --> 02:12:31,060
saying that you're gonna you can't grow

2747
02:12:28,869 --> 02:12:34,569
papayas like in an integrated food

2748
02:12:31,060 --> 02:12:37,539
forest absolutely you can grow papayas

2749
02:12:34,569 --> 02:12:39,729
and then grow papayas on a twenty acre

2750
02:12:37,539 --> 02:12:41,979
plot and it's beautiful eyes not to show

2751
02:12:39,729 --> 02:12:43,959
up you probably missed the point

2752
02:12:41,979 --> 02:12:45,968
and that's the idea is that you know

2753
02:12:43,960 --> 02:12:48,219
with the fruit fright fly problem is

2754
02:12:45,969 --> 02:12:50,198
happening because of big AG so big AG

2755
02:12:48,219 --> 02:12:52,239
has gone in there they've killed all of

2756
02:12:50,198 --> 02:12:56,178
the predator bugs they've killed all of

2757
02:12:52,238 --> 02:12:59,569
the other things that are in the soil

2758
02:12:56,179 --> 02:13:02,609
actually you know eat any type of food

2759
02:12:59,569 --> 02:13:05,309
that's breeding and it's creepy nada

2760
02:13:02,609 --> 02:13:07,289
balance system so they think that Big

2761
02:13:05,310 --> 02:13:11,000
Ideas created a horrible outta balance

2762
02:13:07,289 --> 02:13:15,269
system on the place were not in Hawaii

2763
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:22,920
until they were introduced on some sort

2764
02:13:15,270 --> 02:13:28,380
of agricultural crop you know I forget

2765
02:13:22,920 --> 02:13:30,569
what it was about thirty years ago and

2766
02:13:28,380 --> 02:13:33,449
now they're dealing with it with the rat

2767
02:13:30,569 --> 02:13:34,710
lungworm and the rat lungworm is is also

2768
02:13:33,448 --> 02:13:37,738
something that is a hundred percent

2769
02:13:34,710 --> 02:13:42,710
brought about by big AG so we're just

2770
02:13:37,738 --> 02:13:42,709
naming problems that are problems on top

2771
02:13:45,889 --> 02:13:52,020
Hawaiian commercial bio farmers there's

2772
02:13:49,560 --> 02:13:54,570
a reason why they're growing GMO because

2773
02:13:52,020 --> 02:13:57,239
it's easy to grow whereas the other

2774
02:13:54,569 --> 02:13:59,219
crops are very very difficult what's

2775
02:13:57,238 --> 02:14:01,828
happening on that level is a

2776
02:13:59,219 --> 02:14:04,050
brainwashing happening by the government

2777
02:14:01,828 --> 02:14:06,719
that says you can't do this you have to

2778
02:14:04,050 --> 02:14:09,000
buy it from the store it's cheaper I

2779
02:14:06,719 --> 02:14:11,099
mean there's nothing cheaper than

2780
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:14,969
someone growing and something for free

2781
02:14:11,099 --> 02:14:17,010
in their backyard and yeah also look at

2782
02:14:14,969 --> 02:14:20,698
what why is happening on Maui you've

2783
02:14:17,010 --> 02:14:22,199
lost the pineapple right that used to be

2784
02:14:20,698 --> 02:14:23,339
a me it's you're a part of the

2785
02:14:22,198 --> 02:14:30,118
agriculture and then you've lost

2786
02:14:23,340 --> 02:14:31,529
sugarcane I so the Louisiana so what's

2787
02:14:30,118 --> 02:14:33,779
happening people and why you're seeing a

2788
02:14:31,529 --> 02:14:36,090
large swaths of GMO start to come and

2789
02:14:33,779 --> 02:14:37,800
why it's there's a lot of experiments

2790
02:14:36,090 --> 02:14:41,039
currently going on is because they have

2791
02:14:37,800 --> 02:14:42,599
now sold or leasing this all that planet

2792
02:14:41,039 --> 02:14:45,300
was for sugarcane and now they're

2793
02:14:42,599 --> 02:14:47,639
basically I was there over the holidays

2794
02:14:45,300 --> 02:14:50,369
and so all kinds of experimental fields

2795
02:14:47,639 --> 02:14:54,779
of all kinds of experimental crops from

2796
02:14:50,368 --> 02:14:56,880
sunflowers to all kind of other things I

2797
02:14:54,779 --> 02:14:59,009
couldn't necessarily name so there's

2798
02:14:56,880 --> 02:15:00,539
large swaths of all the center of Maui

2799
02:14:59,010 --> 02:15:02,280
that they're just trying to figure out

2800
02:15:00,539 --> 02:15:04,618
what they're doing agriculture at least

2801
02:15:02,279 --> 02:15:06,689
so I'm starting to hear all this is

2802
02:15:04,618 --> 02:15:08,618
happening and that that's all trading

2803
02:15:06,689 --> 02:15:10,418
place because it's such a

2804
02:15:08,618 --> 02:15:12,009
beautiful place and you know that I've

2805
02:15:10,418 --> 02:15:14,340
even seeing that going down is rather

2806
02:15:12,010 --> 02:15:17,050
disheartening yeah they've gone from

2807
02:15:14,340 --> 02:15:19,149
mass-producing pineapple and sugar cane

2808
02:15:17,050 --> 02:15:23,168
to mass producing genetically modified

2809
02:15:19,149 --> 02:15:24,789
seed and it's not ye the only reason why

2810
02:15:23,168 --> 02:15:26,168
they're doing that is because the plots

2811
02:15:24,788 --> 02:15:27,969
of land that were left that you're

2812
02:15:26,168 --> 02:15:31,029
talking about like the sugar cane and

2813
02:15:27,969 --> 02:15:33,908
and the pineapple is not much else can

2814
02:15:31,029 --> 02:15:36,188
grow there it's totally dead dirt land

2815
02:15:33,908 --> 02:15:38,848
that isn't only dead but like it's

2816
02:15:36,189 --> 02:15:41,649
totally toxic so that's why we're really

2817
02:15:38,849 --> 02:15:43,659
encouraging the cannabis industry to

2818
02:15:41,649 --> 02:15:46,090
start unveiling these these issues and

2819
02:15:43,658 --> 02:15:48,878
problems and actually has taken the Maui

2820
02:15:46,090 --> 02:15:51,189
cannabis guild that those are the job

2821
02:15:48,878 --> 02:15:52,779
that are talking about this it takes the

2822
02:15:51,189 --> 02:15:54,340
cannabis folks to have these

2823
02:15:52,779 --> 02:15:56,768
conversations they're getting together

2824
02:15:54,340 --> 02:15:58,449
and they're starting to really challenge

2825
02:15:56,769 --> 02:16:00,099
the problems that are going on in Maui

2826
02:15:58,448 --> 02:16:01,898
and throughout the the island and I

2827
02:16:00,099 --> 02:16:04,659
think it's a wake-up just for humans

2828
02:16:01,899 --> 02:16:06,639
like it's not just go to the store and

2829
02:16:04,658 --> 02:16:09,069
get what you need like there's things we

2830
02:16:06,639 --> 02:16:10,809
can do we're not saying you know that

2831
02:16:09,069 --> 02:16:12,038
one person can grow everything they need

2832
02:16:10,809 --> 02:16:14,619
in their in their backyard what we're

2833
02:16:12,038 --> 02:16:17,559
saying is let's do some things that we

2834
02:16:14,618 --> 02:16:21,488
can do and make a difference and there

2835
02:16:17,559 --> 02:16:23,019
are beautiful people agree with you when

2836
02:16:21,488 --> 02:16:25,418
I lived in Santa Cruz County

2837
02:16:23,019 --> 02:16:29,349
I grew forty five kinds of fruits and

2838
02:16:25,418 --> 02:16:32,068
vegetables every year so I mean it's

2839
02:16:29,349 --> 02:16:34,960
where my heart comes from I am a a

2840
02:16:32,068 --> 02:16:39,908
Frenchie Jensen organic biodynamic

2841
02:16:34,959 --> 02:16:41,648
grower oh what's happen and those are

2842
02:16:39,908 --> 02:16:43,779
those things that we need to continue

2843
02:16:41,648 --> 02:16:46,658
bringing to the light in this new time

2844
02:16:43,779 --> 02:16:48,969
coming so you know we're we're we're

2845
02:16:46,658 --> 02:16:50,859
very hopeful and there really are a lot

2846
02:16:48,968 --> 02:16:52,658
of people doing a lot of amazing things

2847
02:16:50,859 --> 02:16:54,849
and we traveled to incredible farms that

2848
02:16:52,658 --> 02:16:57,218
are making a big difference and you know

2849
02:16:54,849 --> 02:16:59,769
things to hit agriculture in the blue

2850
02:16:57,218 --> 02:17:01,358
dragon farm and and conscious rhythms

2851
02:16:59,769 --> 02:17:03,099
and all the people that we visited on

2852
02:17:01,359 --> 02:17:05,079
the islands there's there's there's

2853
02:17:03,099 --> 02:17:07,000
beautiful things happening and we can

2854
02:17:05,079 --> 02:17:09,398
make a difference so I mean that the

2855
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:11,079
bottom line is there's a lot of hope out

2856
02:17:09,398 --> 02:17:13,599
there and we really just need to

2857
02:17:11,079 --> 02:17:15,519
continue to be very very smart and have

2858
02:17:13,599 --> 02:17:17,260
a lot of energy and really inspire each

2859
02:17:15,519 --> 02:17:18,969
other to do to make a difference so

2860
02:17:17,260 --> 02:17:21,670
that's that's really what we're doing

2861
02:17:18,968 --> 02:17:24,250
and and I would like to say on a hash

2862
02:17:21,670 --> 02:17:28,300
that there was a lot of really beautiful

2863
02:17:24,250 --> 02:17:33,250
hash on the islands and we really

2864
02:17:28,300 --> 02:17:37,059
enjoyed it I mean water hash rice it

2865
02:17:33,250 --> 02:17:40,479
yeah it wasn't we didn't see any dry sip

2866
02:17:37,059 --> 02:17:43,149
it was mostly water hash and you know

2867
02:17:40,479 --> 02:17:49,539
and freeze-dried and you know good

2868
02:17:43,149 --> 02:17:51,819
strains like soured tangi hit maybe we

2869
02:17:49,540 --> 02:17:54,700
also brought some some hash over from

2870
02:17:51,819 --> 02:18:00,069
California to pick up ice wook and crush

2871
02:17:54,700 --> 02:18:02,350
Kirk that's awesome yeah you know a lot

2872
02:18:00,069 --> 02:18:04,449
of nice bubble floating around these

2873
02:18:02,350 --> 02:18:06,610
days I got some some really nice bubble

2874
02:18:04,450 --> 02:18:09,730
from from you guys that Mendo breath is

2875
02:18:06,610 --> 02:18:11,860
really just when you blew it out people

2876
02:18:09,729 --> 02:18:14,559
were like what that tastes like

2877
02:18:11,860 --> 02:18:16,060
that smells like some crazy perfume or

2878
02:18:14,559 --> 02:18:17,649
something it just had the most

2879
02:18:16,059 --> 02:18:20,439
incredible smell in the air

2880
02:18:17,649 --> 02:18:22,841
my uncle quite enjoyed it actually back

2881
02:18:20,440 --> 02:18:24,880
in Manitoba which I got to give my uncle

2882
02:18:22,841 --> 02:18:26,530
a shout out not sure if you guys have

2883
02:18:24,879 --> 02:18:28,389
ever watched the channel people who are

2884
02:18:26,530 --> 02:18:29,920
watching right now have maybe not no one

2885
02:18:28,389 --> 02:18:32,319
on the panel but I did a show with my

2886
02:18:29,920 --> 02:18:34,540
uncle but last time I was in Winnipeg in

2887
02:18:32,319 --> 02:18:36,159
January just a live show on my phone so

2888
02:18:34,540 --> 02:18:37,750
I I don't have a recording of an

2889
02:18:36,159 --> 02:18:41,260
unfortunately but he's an awesome dude

2890
02:18:37,750 --> 02:18:43,690
and he like barrel-rolled his truck like

2891
02:18:41,260 --> 02:18:45,250
three times yesterday on the highway

2892
02:18:43,690 --> 02:18:47,620
after getting cut off he lives in a

2893
02:18:45,250 --> 02:18:49,809
cabin in the woods like an hour and a

2894
02:18:47,620 --> 02:18:53,500
half away from from the city of Winnipeg

2895
02:18:49,809 --> 02:18:55,930
but hey ruled he's like 65 years old -

2896
02:18:53,500 --> 02:18:58,870
so he rolled his truck multiple times

2897
02:18:55,930 --> 02:19:01,239
but got a little uh got a little bruised

2898
02:18:58,870 --> 02:19:02,680
but said he was okay but still want to

2899
02:19:01,239 --> 02:19:05,979
give a shout out to him and hope that

2900
02:19:02,680 --> 02:19:08,530
yeah uncle Gio exactly uncle Gio I hope

2901
02:19:05,979 --> 02:19:11,199

crazy I'm glad you're okay in fact it's

2903
02:19:11,200 --> 02:19:16,960
crazy how fast things can happen one

2904
02:19:14,409 --> 02:19:23,129
thing you did if you need us to send him

2905
02:19:16,959 --> 02:19:25,479
some more Mendo brass let us know and we

2906
02:19:23,129 --> 02:19:28,359
prepared this year with some really

2907
02:19:25,479 --> 02:19:31,779
beautiful - strains - so we brought up

2908
02:19:28,360 --> 02:19:33,510
we have a couple of plants of the

2909
02:19:31,780 --> 02:19:35,309
strawberry guava and the

2910
02:19:33,510 --> 02:19:38,880
breath going we're really excited about

2911
02:19:35,308 --> 02:19:41,099
that we have amazing crosses from gage

2912
02:19:38,879 --> 02:19:43,259
green and the high school sweethearts

2913
02:19:41,099 --> 02:19:44,790
and the motor breasts and the dizzy

2914
02:19:43,260 --> 02:19:47,460
breasts really excited about that

2915
02:19:44,790 --> 02:19:51,450
the massive seeds and the hella seed

2916
02:19:47,459 --> 02:19:54,209
company lots of citrus smoothies and the

2917
02:19:51,450 --> 02:19:56,520
lip fuse and the GAC strains I mean

2918
02:19:54,209 --> 02:19:59,608
really it's kind of on and on like

2919
02:19:56,520 --> 02:20:03,149
there's the Emerald Mountain legacy

2920
02:19:59,609 --> 02:20:05,609
family and all of the the royal cush

2921
02:20:03,148 --> 02:20:06,689
lines you know just we're really excited

2922
02:20:05,609 --> 02:20:08,760
about all the seeds that have been

2923
02:20:06,689 --> 02:20:10,529
gifted to us so we didn't name all of

2924
02:20:08,760 --> 02:20:13,290
the seeds that we got but we want to

2925
02:20:10,529 --> 02:20:14,850
give a lot of love to everyone that

2926
02:20:13,290 --> 02:20:16,229
we've been trading and getting seeds

2927
02:20:14,850 --> 02:20:18,479
from we're really excited about this

2928
02:20:16,228 --> 02:20:20,549
year I think we're gonna make an impact

2929
02:20:18,478 --> 02:20:22,679
and and we've been traveling around and

2930
02:20:20,549 --> 02:20:24,329
getting all the hemp seeds so really

2931
02:20:22,680 --> 02:20:26,189
upping our hemp game and that's going to

2932
02:20:24,329 --> 02:20:28,228
be the majority of what we're what we're

2933
02:20:26,189 --> 02:20:32,550
doing this year and continuing on with

2934
02:20:28,228 --> 02:20:35,159
the real medicine so super important I'm

2935
02:20:32,549 --> 02:20:38,719
definitely gonna put the family in the

2936
02:20:35,159 --> 02:20:38,719
vehicle and come down and see you guys

2937
02:20:42,318 --> 02:20:47,639
ask your hand question that you were

2938
02:20:45,600 --> 02:20:52,200
talking to me about that Marcus said

2939
02:20:47,639 --> 02:20:55,559
save her for church well what which

2940
02:20:52,200 --> 02:20:59,460
question was that I forget remember we

2941
02:20:55,559 --> 02:21:02,459
were talking no THC and Rice FC media

2942
02:20:59,459 --> 02:21:03,539
oh that's right well I don't know what

2943
02:21:02,459 --> 02:21:07,858
to say

2944
02:21:03,540 --> 02:21:13,050
I've never seen an analysis of a CBD dry

2945
02:21:07,859 --> 02:21:16,620
cept that was over 50% that had below

2946
02:21:13,049 --> 02:21:20,159
point three percent GT I've never seen

2947
02:21:16,620 --> 02:21:27,180
it and I've done thousands and thousands

2948
02:21:20,159 --> 02:21:29,398
and thousands of analysis yes oh maybe

2949
02:21:27,180 --> 02:21:33,630
just ask in general as anyone I've ever

2950
02:21:29,398 --> 02:21:36,959
seen that before I haven't but I I've

2951
02:21:33,629 --> 02:21:40,409
never seen dry sift from from hemp

2952
02:21:36,959 --> 02:21:43,259
before I haven't seen wait let me back

2953
02:21:40,409 --> 02:21:45,629
up and say I've seen you know trichomes

2954
02:21:43,260 --> 02:21:47,130
that have fallen off of hem during the

2955
02:21:45,629 --> 02:21:50,759
processing of found you

2956
02:21:47,129 --> 02:21:52,739
kind of like a you know a brown dust you

2957
02:21:50,760 --> 02:21:55,739
know it's not intentionally made like

2958
02:21:52,739 --> 02:21:59,270
dry sift but for all temper purposes of

2959
02:21:55,739 --> 02:22:03,709
his you know knocked off plant matter

2960
02:21:59,270 --> 02:22:06,569
well this is this is dry set high CBD

2961
02:22:03,709 --> 02:22:09,209
variety called the I think it was

2962
02:22:06,569 --> 02:22:11,069
champagne or III don't remember the name

2963
02:22:09,209 --> 02:22:14,219
there was a couple of them that they had

2964
02:22:11,069 --> 02:22:18,680
and it was fifty to sixty percent

2965
02:22:14,219 --> 02:22:22,529
CBD and they claimed it was all below

2966
02:22:18,680 --> 02:22:25,680
0.3 percent THC their analysis showed it

2967
02:22:22,530 --> 02:22:28,020
at one point one of them was one point

2968
02:22:25,680 --> 02:22:28,620
eight and one of them was two point

2969
02:22:28,020 --> 02:22:32,310
something

2970
02:22:28,620 --> 02:22:35,040
but they were really really low and see

2971
02:22:32,309 --> 02:22:37,469
the problem with that is that if you

2972
02:22:35,040 --> 02:22:41,160
start with a variety of cannabis we'll

2973
02:22:37,469 --> 02:22:46,409
say it's 15% CBD and you're going to get

2974
02:22:41,159 --> 02:22:50,579
sixty percent okay and it's point three

2975
02:22:46,409 --> 02:22:52,829
percent four point two 50 Hz well your

2976
02:22:50,579 --> 02:22:57,629
stress it this would be four times of

2977
02:22:52,829 --> 02:23:00,989
that at least you understand not gonna

2978
02:22:57,629 --> 02:23:04,469
work and there's a real problem is that

2979
02:23:00,989 --> 02:23:10,049
they recently discovered that the CBD

2980
02:23:04,469 --> 02:23:13,260
synthase genes produced THC awesome in

2981
02:23:10,049 --> 02:23:21,688
about a twenty to one ratio so if

2982
02:23:13,260 --> 02:23:25,130
there's 20 % TP he will be 1% THC yeah

2983
02:23:21,689 --> 02:23:25,130
so it leaks a little bit

2984
02:23:25,931 --> 02:23:36,551
kids there's yes yeah I agree with you

2985
02:23:34,120 --> 02:23:40,270
skunk man for sure what we're seeing is

2986
02:23:36,550 --> 02:23:46,210
is like a ratio thing I've never heard

2987
02:23:40,271 --> 02:23:49,121
of the wolf strain that was one down in

2988
02:23:46,210 --> 02:23:51,040
Louisiana and down in the south and

2989
02:23:49,120 --> 02:23:52,090
they're actually getting and it's in

2990
02:23:51,040 --> 02:23:55,300
North Carolina

2991
02:23:52,091 --> 02:23:57,940
THC with like an upwards of those 10 %

2992
02:23:55,300 --> 02:23:59,350
9% CBD and that's just really

2993
02:23:57,940 --> 02:24:01,989
interesting it's not actually a

2994
02:23:59,351 --> 02:24:05,711
non-detectable THC which sort of blows

2995
02:24:01,989 --> 02:24:10,060
out that whole sort of ratio ideology do

2996
02:24:05,710 --> 02:24:13,899
you know that strain I'd like to see the

2997
02:24:10,060 --> 02:24:21,341
analysis because I don't trust most

2998
02:24:13,899 --> 02:24:22,989
analysis I just yeah totally agreed and

2999
02:24:21,341 --> 02:24:24,851
it's something that you know I would

3000
02:24:22,989 --> 02:24:28,540
like to see fourth I saw some analysis

3001
02:24:24,851 --> 02:24:31,001
but only from two different labs that

3002
02:24:28,540 --> 02:24:32,411
were down from North Carolina is it we

3003
02:24:31,001 --> 02:24:35,501
have the seeds so we're gonna be working

3004
02:24:32,411 --> 02:24:37,390
with it and seeing what we can find

3005
02:24:35,501 --> 02:24:39,700
is it hard to talk intelligently about

3006
02:24:37,390 --> 02:24:43,001
something when the basis of what we're

3007
02:24:39,700 --> 02:24:45,221
talking about it is not stable like

3008
02:24:43,001 --> 02:24:47,171
testing you know we're talking about

3009
02:24:45,220 --> 02:24:48,341
cannabinoids and ratios but then at the

3010
02:24:47,171 --> 02:24:50,140
end of the day we're saying but the

3011
02:24:48,341 --> 02:24:53,041
testing isn't good so I mean I'm all

3012
02:24:50,140 --> 02:24:59,199
about it but it's it is frustrating it

3013
02:24:53,040 --> 02:25:03,670
for 25 years and I did testing where I

3014
02:24:59,200 --> 02:25:06,490
set exact same copies to dr. Burnham in

3015
02:25:03,671 --> 02:25:09,761
Switzerland dr. o Sole aged in the

3016
02:25:06,489 --> 02:25:13,390
United States Mississippi and my own lab

3017
02:25:09,761 --> 02:25:15,190
and we were always in agreement it's

3018
02:25:13,390 --> 02:25:17,140
feeling better it's not the methods or

3019
02:25:15,190 --> 02:25:18,940
the instruments it's really you know

3020
02:25:17,140 --> 02:25:20,171
it's everything coupled together when

3021
02:25:18,940 --> 02:25:23,501
you're doing a quantitative

3022
02:25:20,171 --> 02:25:26,351
determination of measuring of anything

3023
02:25:23,501 --> 02:25:29,171
especially at low levels your your your

3024
02:25:26,351 --> 02:25:32,801
your your method and and your sampling

3025
02:25:29,171 --> 02:25:35,681
has to be very very accurate and if it

3026
02:25:32,800 --> 02:25:39,760
is accurate and and it is reproducible I

3027
02:25:35,681 --> 02:25:42,279
mean the results that you get are

3028
02:25:39,760 --> 02:25:44,020
actually good like Sam said yeah but

3029
02:25:42,279 --> 02:25:47,229
first thing you have to do mark is make

3030
02:25:44,020 --> 02:25:51,100
sure that you get take three samples of

3031
02:25:47,228 --> 02:25:56,858
the same step and get three reproducible

3032
02:25:51,100 --> 02:25:58,840
results in your own map yeah the first

3033
02:25:56,859 --> 02:26:00,670
thing you have to do I mean if you're

3034
02:25:58,840 --> 02:26:03,010
doing the measurements yourself is you

3035
02:26:00,670 --> 02:26:05,859
have to have an instrument that's

3036
02:26:03,010 --> 02:26:08,109
properly calibrated and your analytical

3037
02:26:05,859 --> 02:26:11,020
method where you're actually taking a

3038
02:26:08,109 --> 02:26:13,149
small sample of plant material and you

3039
02:26:11,020 --> 02:26:16,029
know weighing it out and determining how

3040
02:26:13,148 --> 02:26:18,099
much CBD or how much THC or how much you

3041
02:26:16,029 --> 02:26:20,500
know doing a cannabinoid profile

3042
02:26:18,100 --> 02:26:22,930
measurement by HPLC you know it requires

3043
02:26:20,500 --> 02:26:26,109
an analytical balance that could read up

3044
02:26:22,930 --> 02:26:28,750
to four decimal points and you know

3045
02:26:26,109 --> 02:26:32,229
you're weighing stuff out and you're

3046
02:26:28,750 --> 02:26:36,398
dissolving it and you're basically using

3047
02:26:32,228 --> 02:26:39,099
a good analytical method you should be

3048
02:26:36,398 --> 02:26:40,869
able to get reproducible results but I

3049
02:26:39,100 --> 02:26:45,818
think what you're saying Sam is that you

3050
02:26:40,870 --> 02:26:48,399
should do three individual samples from

3051
02:26:45,818 --> 02:26:51,789
the same plant material it's typically

3052
02:26:48,398 --> 02:26:54,659
like when you ask a lab to repeat the

3053
02:26:51,790 --> 02:26:57,640
result they're repeating it on the same

3054
02:26:54,659 --> 02:27:00,010
sample but it's good to know that you

3055
02:26:57,639 --> 02:27:02,680
know again the sample that you have is a

3056
02:27:00,010 --> 02:27:06,250
good representative sample for what

3057
02:27:02,680 --> 02:27:07,930
you're trying to you know analyze so in

3058
02:27:06,250 --> 02:27:10,148
a lot of these labs what you'll see is

3059
02:27:07,930 --> 02:27:13,120
you know things like Boeing Bullock

3060
02:27:10,148 --> 02:27:15,789
grinders that basically take the plant

3061
02:27:13,120 --> 02:27:18,760
material and completely homogenized it

3062
02:27:15,790 --> 02:27:22,750
into like a green powder so it's

3063
02:27:18,760 --> 02:27:25,840
completely homogeneous and you know the

3064
02:27:22,750 --> 02:27:29,500
level of sophistication in some of these

3065
02:27:25,840 --> 02:27:33,100
labs aren't such that you can get really

3066
02:27:29,500 --> 02:27:36,459
good reproducible results because more

3067
02:27:33,100 --> 02:27:38,859
of the analytical method and exactly

3068
02:27:36,459 --> 02:27:41,289
what they're using you know in terms of

3069
02:27:38,859 --> 02:27:42,520
cycles when we started our lab we had

3070
02:27:41,290 --> 02:27:45,970
serious problems

3071
02:27:42,520 --> 02:27:49,060
number one was we ordered our standards

3072
02:27:45,969 --> 02:27:53,309
from the NI da and from the United

3073
02:27:49,059 --> 02:27:56,109
Nations a drug group in Geneva and

3074
02:27:53,309 --> 02:28:01,538
resented to us and they said when they

3075
02:27:56,109 --> 02:28:03,969
were not 39.8% TV whatever well when we

3076
02:28:01,539 --> 02:28:08,049
finally tested it and we had else Olli

3077
02:28:03,968 --> 02:28:12,398
Rehn isin in our own result it was less

3078
02:28:08,049 --> 02:28:14,229
than 86 oh man well that's not good I

3079
02:28:12,398 --> 02:28:16,328
mean that's one thing that has improved

3080
02:28:14,228 --> 02:28:18,938
I mean several things actually have

3081
02:28:16,328 --> 02:28:21,609
improved when I think about it is that

3082
02:28:18,939 --> 02:28:25,029
there are now equipment manufacturers

3083
02:28:21,609 --> 02:28:27,430
who are making analytical equipment that

3084
02:28:25,029 --> 02:28:30,488
is a very sophisticated analytical

3085
02:28:27,430 --> 02:28:34,119
equipment but easy enough for someone

3086
02:28:30,488 --> 02:28:37,648
who can use a web browser to basically

3087
02:28:34,119 --> 02:28:40,659
operate the the good thing is that again

3088
02:28:37,648 --> 02:28:43,148
making it easier to operate hopefully

3089
02:28:40,658 --> 02:28:44,498
takes out a lot of the user error that's

3090
02:28:43,148 --> 02:28:47,528
associated with making these

3091
02:28:44,498 --> 02:28:49,389
measurements but the analytical

3092
02:28:47,529 --> 02:28:52,658
standards are now available from

3093
02:28:49,389 --> 02:28:55,478
companies and you can get these again at

3094
02:28:52,658 --> 02:28:57,639
this exceedingly low concentration that

3095
02:28:55,478 --> 02:29:00,158
makes it not something that they have to

3096
02:28:57,639 --> 02:29:02,648
report to the DEA but the company that

3097
02:29:00,158 --> 02:29:04,898
actually makes the standards has to have

3098
02:29:02,648 --> 02:29:07,809
a Schedule one license because obviously

3099
02:29:04,898 --> 02:29:11,798
they're making these solutions of THC

3100
02:29:07,809 --> 02:29:14,109
and CBD and all the analytical standards

3101
02:29:11,799 --> 02:29:17,459
and in what you have to run as you

3102
02:29:14,109 --> 02:29:19,748
remember Sam is a calibration curve

3103
02:29:17,459 --> 02:29:21,879
where you take those analytical

3104
02:29:19,748 --> 02:29:24,878
standards and you do serial dilutions

3105
02:29:21,879 --> 02:29:27,549
and you look to see how the peak and the

3106
02:29:24,879 --> 02:29:30,249
chromatogram decreases as a function of

3107
02:29:27,549 --> 02:29:32,739
concentration and that gives you what's

3108
02:29:30,248 --> 02:29:35,439
called a calibration curve which again

3109
02:29:32,738 --> 02:29:38,350
gives you a good indication that you

3110
02:29:35,439 --> 02:29:43,148
could measure that cannabinoid to those

3111
02:29:38,350 --> 02:29:46,629
levels of sensitivity and then if that

3112
02:29:43,148 --> 02:29:49,628
is all Square and you use the same

3113
02:29:46,629 --> 02:29:53,079
method to analyze your experimental

3114
02:29:49,629 --> 02:29:55,319
samples cannabis sample XYZ then you

3115
02:29:53,078 --> 02:29:58,298
should be able to get a reproducible

3116
02:29:55,318 --> 02:30:02,859
test result so in that way I think

3117
02:29:58,299 --> 02:30:05,770
testing has improved in that there there

3118
02:30:02,859 --> 02:30:06,310
are good methods and good analytical

3119
02:30:05,770 --> 02:30:10,301
stand

3120
02:30:06,310 --> 02:30:11,380
for for it to be employed so Sam I have

3121
02:30:10,300 --> 02:30:16,300
a question for you

3122
02:30:11,380 --> 02:30:18,550
did did you guys all all those different

3123
02:30:16,300 --> 02:30:21,560
labs that you were sending to did you

3124
02:30:18,550 --> 02:30:25,449
all do the exact same

3125
02:30:21,560 --> 02:30:28,369
yeah we use the same protocol correct

3126
02:30:25,450 --> 02:30:30,079
when we calibrated our laboratories when

3127
02:30:28,370 --> 02:30:31,579
we were originally doing testing we

3128
02:30:30,079 --> 02:30:33,771
brought the person over from Europe

3129
02:30:31,579 --> 02:30:36,319
who'd made the testing solution for

3130
02:30:33,771 --> 02:30:38,900
government so that's was very helpful

3131
02:30:36,319 --> 02:30:41,390
for us because then they were able to

3132
02:30:38,899 --> 02:30:44,750
then do ring testing immediately with

3133
02:30:41,390 --> 02:30:47,359
other laboratories so we were able to so

3134
02:30:44,750 --> 02:30:50,000
at least nail down THC until then that

3135
02:30:47,360 --> 02:30:55,030
secondary spikes TVB came around this is

3136
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:58,601
what Oh 809 so you know that was for us

3137
02:30:55,030 --> 02:31:00,920
you think it's got better Oh

3138
02:30:58,601 --> 02:31:04,130
significantly better but you know that's

3139
02:31:00,920 --> 02:31:07,700
also it's it's not consistently standard

3140
02:31:04,129 --> 02:31:10,069
across you know the board so even though

3141
02:31:07,700 --> 02:31:12,200
there are standards now put out and now

3142
02:31:10,069 --> 02:31:15,011
everybody knows how to arrive at a

3143
02:31:12,200 --> 02:31:17,601
certain result we're getting there but

3144
02:31:15,011 --> 02:31:19,851
we're still trying to add and find out

3145
02:31:17,601 --> 02:31:21,021
what's you know what we don't what we

3146
02:31:19,851 --> 02:31:23,030
can't see you know what are the

3147
02:31:21,021 --> 02:31:24,230
pesticides whether they're herbicides

3148
02:31:23,030 --> 02:31:27,409
what are the other things that people

3149
02:31:24,229 --> 02:31:30,159
have been adding so that's now again

3150
02:31:27,409 --> 02:31:32,720
shifted to get away from us the

3151
02:31:30,159 --> 02:31:35,390
dispensaries who - now the distributors

3152
02:31:32,720 --> 02:31:37,279
and the growers because they have to

3153
02:31:35,390 --> 02:31:41,109
actually have it tested before it even

3154
02:31:37,280 --> 02:31:42,950
gets to us whereas what lab do you use I

3155
02:31:41,110 --> 02:31:45,739
don't use a lab anymore

3156
02:31:42,950 --> 02:31:47,450
oddly enough I use the one I used a

3157
02:31:45,739 --> 02:31:49,190
laboratory and we calibrated a

3158
02:31:47,450 --> 02:31:53,271
laboratory right around the corner from

3159
02:31:49,190 --> 02:31:54,771
us that actually did over testing for

3160
02:31:53,271 --> 02:31:59,540
Novartis and Bayer so they were

3161
02:31:54,771 --> 02:32:02,271
basically dealing with liver and living

3162
02:31:59,540 --> 02:32:04,910
cell tissues and a couple of the guys

3163
02:32:02,271 --> 02:32:06,620
were also who ran the machines were also

3164
02:32:04,909 --> 02:32:10,129
growers so they started testing their

3165
02:32:06,620 --> 02:32:11,721
own and we were engaged together and we

3166
02:32:10,129 --> 02:32:14,390
started that discussion and then we

3167
02:32:11,720 --> 02:32:17,720
started you know we spent literally

3168
02:32:14,390 --> 02:32:20,270
millions of dollars on testing just to

3169
02:32:17,720 --> 02:32:22,699
get everything up to calibrated and

3170
02:32:20,271 --> 02:32:25,280
understanding just how to come up with a

3171
02:32:22,700 --> 02:32:26,750
methodology that we could get into the

3172
02:32:25,280 --> 02:32:28,130
laboratories you couldn't get cannabis

3173
02:32:26,750 --> 02:32:30,940
into the laboratories because then it's

3174
02:32:28,129 --> 02:32:34,760
a ten thousand dollar fine per test so

3175
02:32:30,940 --> 02:32:35,270
that same gentleman helped us come up

3176
02:32:34,761 --> 02:32:37,789
with them

3177
02:32:35,270 --> 02:32:40,189
theology where we took a certain amount

3178
02:32:37,789 --> 02:32:43,550
he told us how to do a representative

3179
02:32:40,189 --> 02:32:45,889
sample from a key a pound to a kilo then

3180
02:32:43,549 --> 02:32:47,299
we would take that put it in we would

3181
02:32:45,889 --> 02:32:49,760
grind it for a certain amount of times

3182
02:32:47,299 --> 02:32:51,318
put it in a 100 percent alcohol shake it

3183
02:32:49,760 --> 02:32:53,600
for a certain amount of times then we

3184
02:32:51,318 --> 02:32:56,328
would take a pipette and extract that

3185
02:32:53,600 --> 02:32:58,550
solution and then we would take that

3186
02:32:56,328 --> 02:33:01,578
solution and that could then go to the

3187
02:32:58,549 --> 02:33:04,158
laboratory and then be tested so that

3188
02:33:01,578 --> 02:33:05,600
way we weren't actually putting we were

3189
02:33:04,158 --> 02:33:07,629
getting as much of the cannabinoids

3190
02:33:05,600 --> 02:33:10,158
dissolved and we tried many different

3191
02:33:07,629 --> 02:33:12,108
solutions but one hundred percent of

3192
02:33:10,158 --> 02:33:14,629
alcohol turned out to be the best

3193
02:33:12,109 --> 02:33:17,949
methodology for both the gas

3194
02:33:14,629 --> 02:33:21,349
chromatograph and the view UV HPLC so

3195
02:33:17,949 --> 02:33:24,710
they this laboratory around the corner

3196
02:33:21,350 --> 02:33:29,180
had both machines but as we start to get

3197
02:33:24,709 --> 02:33:32,238
expansive those people who actually own

3198
02:33:29,180 --> 02:33:34,158
those UV HPLC machines with which they

3199
02:33:32,238 --> 02:33:36,170
had six to eight of them and that's

3200
02:33:34,158 --> 02:33:38,389
hundreds of thousands of not millions of

3201
02:33:36,170 --> 02:33:40,699
dollars basically weren't too happy with

3202
02:33:38,389 --> 02:33:42,590
what we're doing and in the end they

3203
02:33:40,699 --> 02:33:44,779
went their way and I had to find other

3204
02:33:42,590 --> 02:33:48,529
laboratories to work with so that was

3205
02:33:44,779 --> 02:33:50,869
the frustration of pioneering back then

3206
02:33:48,529 --> 02:33:53,119
but without a doubt dr. Sheldon with

3207
02:33:50,869 --> 02:33:55,460
it's gotten a lot better across the

3208
02:33:53,119 --> 02:33:57,020
board even when after that and the other

3209
02:33:55,459 --> 02:34:00,799
laboratories that we were dealing with

3210
02:33:57,020 --> 02:34:03,949
CW here was doing a lot of our testing

3211
02:34:00,799 --> 02:34:07,519
but that still took you know takes 72

3212
02:34:03,949 --> 02:34:10,250
hours for the culture test for you know

3213
02:34:07,520 --> 02:34:12,020
microbes or you know microbiology and

3214
02:34:10,250 --> 02:34:15,648
then you had to then do the actual

3215
02:34:12,020 --> 02:34:17,920
screening for the THC CBD and then the

3216
02:34:15,648 --> 02:34:21,198
other pesticides so that took another

3217
02:34:17,920 --> 02:34:22,850
considerable amount of time so it just

3218
02:34:21,199 --> 02:34:26,029
takes a lot of time unfortunately to

3219
02:34:22,850 --> 02:34:28,539
hold in cannabis to get it tested now it

3220
02:34:26,029 --> 02:34:28,539
falls completely

3221
02:34:28,748 --> 02:34:45,760
the the distributor now but we as the

3222
02:34:34,869 --> 02:34:48,578
stores pay for it I think one of the

3223
02:34:45,760 --> 02:34:51,760
challenges in the in the testing realm

3224
02:34:48,578 --> 02:34:53,889
is that it's kind of known in the

3225
02:34:51,760 --> 02:34:55,869
community of growers that there's some

3226
02:34:53,889 --> 02:34:57,969
labs that the test results are a little

3227
02:34:55,869 --> 02:35:00,310
more friendly the numbers are a little

3228
02:34:57,969 --> 02:35:04,719
better but some labs than they are at

3229
02:35:00,309 --> 02:35:07,028
others and when your product gets to the

3230
02:35:04,719 --> 02:35:11,858
dispensary or distributor those higher

3231
02:35:07,029 --> 02:35:14,619
numbers help sell the product that's

3232
02:35:11,859 --> 02:35:18,220
yeah wait that's correct I I see that

3233
02:35:14,619 --> 02:35:20,229
often and in multiple states we've seen

3234
02:35:18,219 --> 02:35:21,969
scandals exposed right it have been

3235
02:35:20,228 --> 02:35:24,849
exposed to the median some labs have

3236
02:35:21,969 --> 02:35:26,349
been shut down but I can't say that I

3237
02:35:24,850 --> 02:35:29,350
don't know that it's not happening

3238
02:35:26,350 --> 02:35:30,789
anymore I don't know if you guys know it

3239
02:35:29,350 --> 02:35:33,640
but we have this weird system in

3240
02:35:30,789 --> 02:35:38,109
California that's routier distribution

3241
02:35:33,639 --> 02:35:40,658
system where all of our testing and

3242
02:35:38,109 --> 02:35:42,729
there's a law that allows research

3243
02:35:40,658 --> 02:35:46,328
R&amp;D testing to happen at the cultivation

3244
02:35:42,728 --> 02:35:48,248
manufacturing level so so yeah retail

3245
02:35:46,328 --> 02:35:50,949
doesn't test at all but I don't know if

3246
02:35:48,248 --> 02:35:53,828
you guys know this history but the

3247
02:35:50,949 --> 02:35:56,739
alcohol industry lobbied our legislature

3248
02:35:53,828 --> 02:35:58,389
and managed to pass this law saying all

3249
02:35:56,738 --> 02:36:01,600
California cannabis had to go through

3250
02:35:58,389 --> 02:36:03,430
six district distribution companies it

3251
02:36:01,600 --> 02:36:05,680
was state law for a very short period of

3252
02:36:03,430 --> 02:36:08,498
time a lot called my cursor all things

3253
02:36:05,680 --> 02:36:11,619
like the started out call them immerse

3254
02:36:08,498 --> 02:36:14,770
alike that skin disease you know total

3255
02:36:11,619 --> 02:36:16,479
poison and and that thing passed through

3256
02:36:14,770 --> 02:36:19,810
the legislature there was only going to

3257
02:36:16,478 --> 02:36:32,858
be six companies it was big alcohol that

3258
02:36:19,809 --> 02:36:35,170
got this legislation passed crazy prop

3259
02:36:32,859 --> 02:36:38,439
64 that's the biggest benefit that prop

3260
02:36:35,170 --> 02:36:40,148
64 did for us because prop 64 and not

3261
02:36:38,439 --> 02:36:41,430
that part of the regulation right out of

3262
02:36:40,148 --> 02:36:44,549
law and said

3263
02:36:41,430 --> 02:36:46,889
we have three-tier distribution then

3264
02:36:44,549 --> 02:36:48,629
anybody can get the license so now

3265
02:36:46,889 --> 02:36:54,389
really anybody can get a distribution

3266
02:36:48,629 --> 02:36:57,299
like when in Oakland and one in Berkeley

3267
02:36:54,389 --> 02:37:00,059
so manufacturing distribution and retail

3268
02:36:57,299 --> 02:37:01,920
so I have done distribution in testing

3269
02:37:00,059 --> 02:37:04,019
the nightmare I hate it I don't want to

3270
02:37:01,920 --> 02:37:07,859
be a distributor because the testing is

3271
02:37:04,020 --> 02:37:09,810
like it's us you're just stuck with it

3272
02:37:07,859 --> 02:37:11,279
the regulations for what you have to do

3273
02:37:09,809 --> 02:37:14,180
for cannabis that doesn't press through

3274
02:37:11,279 --> 02:37:18,029
the testing it's so complicated so

3275
02:37:14,180 --> 02:37:20,370
distribution we had issues with testing

3276
02:37:18,029 --> 02:37:22,020
all your weed and then maybe it going

3277
02:37:20,370 --> 02:37:24,239
into an edible product and then it's

3278
02:37:22,020 --> 02:37:26,250
failing because the food products that

3279
02:37:24,238 --> 02:37:29,520
you combined it with we're not up to the

3280
02:37:26,250 --> 02:37:31,699
same standards as the cannabis you

3281
02:37:29,520 --> 02:37:37,380
should you get your product from from

3282
02:37:31,699 --> 02:37:40,140
cultivators and manufacturers so it's

3283
02:37:37,379 --> 02:37:41,250
kind of flying blind you don't know if

3284
02:37:40,139 --> 02:37:43,108
the product you're getting from

3285
02:37:41,250 --> 02:37:44,939
manufacturing your cultivation passes

3286
02:37:43,109 --> 02:37:48,149
testing yet because the distributor has

3287
02:37:44,939 --> 02:37:50,279
to test it so a distribution you might

3288
02:37:48,148 --> 02:37:52,228
be the one that surprised you failed the

3289
02:37:50,279 --> 02:37:54,060
test and believe me they notify the

3290
02:37:52,228 --> 02:37:56,068
state immediately so suddenly you get a

3291
02:37:54,059 --> 02:38:01,559
note from the BCC also saying we see

3292
02:37:56,068 --> 02:38:07,439
that the flower you days to destroy it

3293
02:38:01,559 --> 02:38:10,049
you can't return it so the motion would

3294
02:38:07,439 --> 02:38:13,439
be to make the product without any

3295
02:38:10,049 --> 02:38:17,759
cannabinoids first have it tested and

3296
02:38:13,439 --> 02:38:20,488
then make it with the tested cannabinoid

3297
02:38:17,760 --> 02:38:23,579
product together with the final product

3298
02:38:20,488 --> 02:38:26,459
and that way you're not just spinning

3299
02:38:23,579 --> 02:38:28,129
your wheels yeah it's a good wizard

3300
02:38:26,459 --> 02:38:32,219
doesn't work that way unfortunately

3301
02:38:28,129 --> 02:38:34,438
currently I'm sorry go ahead well and

3302
02:38:32,219 --> 02:38:37,379
then changing that it takes and there

3303
02:38:34,439 --> 02:38:41,130
you know a Herculean lift of changes at

3304
02:38:37,379 --> 02:38:44,278
the state level the state now is has

3305
02:38:41,129 --> 02:38:45,869
just amended some of the realities that

3306
02:38:44,279 --> 02:38:47,579
we're dealing with in the sense as

3307
02:38:45,870 --> 02:38:49,199
opposed to going through three

3308
02:38:47,579 --> 02:38:51,840
regulatory bodies they're consolidating

3309
02:38:49,199 --> 02:38:53,050
it down to one to kind of make it easy

3310
02:38:51,840 --> 02:38:54,780
for

3311
02:38:53,049 --> 02:38:56,520
[Music]

3312
02:38:54,780 --> 02:38:59,040
some of the you know dealing with but

3313
02:38:56,521 --> 02:39:00,960
regulations but the realities that

3314
02:38:59,040 --> 02:39:02,730
Debbie's talking about when it comes to

3315
02:39:00,959 --> 02:39:05,819
testing and testing product that's just

3316
02:39:02,729 --> 02:39:07,920
the reality of everyday you know dealing

3317
02:39:05,819 --> 02:39:11,511
in cannabis business unfortunately and

3318
02:39:07,920 --> 02:39:15,629
one that used to fall onto us the

3319
02:39:11,511 --> 02:39:16,920
retailers so it's not surprised that

3320
02:39:15,629 --> 02:39:18,180
it's following heavily on the

3321
02:39:16,920 --> 02:39:20,250
distributor I thought it would be

3322
02:39:18,181 --> 02:39:21,721
falling more toward the farmer or the

3323
02:39:20,250 --> 02:39:23,399
farmer would have having it tested and

3324
02:39:21,720 --> 02:39:25,789
taking it to this tribute er but that

3325
02:39:23,399 --> 02:39:30,090
doesn't seem to be the case here in

3326
02:39:25,790 --> 02:39:33,420
Massachusetts I have to before anything

3327
02:39:30,090 --> 02:39:36,989
goes out as a as a cultivator in

3328
02:39:33,420 --> 02:39:39,090
processor it has to be tested and I

3329
02:39:36,989 --> 02:39:42,000
asked everything before I make it into

3330
02:39:39,090 --> 02:39:45,030
water hash you know I don't want to you

3331
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:48,420
know spend all of my time on on you know

3332
02:39:45,030 --> 02:39:50,040
such a focused process and and know at

3333
02:39:48,420 --> 02:39:52,649
the end to have a microbe problem or

3334
02:39:50,040 --> 02:39:56,340
have you metal problem or or or whatever

3335
02:39:52,649 --> 02:39:58,140
it might might be but yeah we have cat

3336
02:39:56,340 --> 02:40:00,511
three screenings so it's it's really

3337
02:39:58,140 --> 02:40:02,640
really really detailed you know so I

3338
02:40:00,511 --> 02:40:04,860
welcome it personally because I like to

3339
02:40:02,640 --> 02:40:07,859
know what I'm starting with before I go

3340
02:40:04,860 --> 02:40:09,870
into the lab and spend my time there and

3341
02:40:07,860 --> 02:40:12,989
then everything therefore after that

3342
02:40:09,870 --> 02:40:14,820
particular manifest if it changes a form

3343
02:40:12,989 --> 02:40:16,619
if I take that water hash and make it

3344
02:40:14,819 --> 02:40:20,101
into something that has to be tested

3345
02:40:16,620 --> 02:40:21,960
again before that even goes out so it's

3346
02:40:20,101 --> 02:40:24,181
a very detailed process that I actually

3347
02:40:21,959 --> 02:40:26,039
welcome and I actually think more people

3348
02:40:24,181 --> 02:40:27,511
should have access to so they can better

3349
02:40:26,040 --> 02:40:28,950
understand the material they're working

3350
02:40:27,511 --> 02:40:39,210
with because it helps us better

3351
02:40:28,950 --> 02:40:43,829
understand our relationship right

3352
02:40:39,209 --> 02:40:45,959
absolutely even more of a reason that we

3353
02:40:43,829 --> 02:40:48,239
need to be purchasing from regenerated

3354
02:40:45,959 --> 02:40:49,770
farmers we all need to start going down

3355
02:40:48,239 --> 02:40:51,989
the roads of regenerative farming

3356
02:40:49,771 --> 02:40:54,271
because regenerative farming just is

3357
02:40:51,989 --> 02:40:56,729
beyond organic and the way that it's

3358
02:40:54,271 --> 02:41:00,061
beyond organic is that people are not

3359
02:40:56,729 --> 02:41:02,369
bringing inputs in from other areas it's

3360
02:41:00,060 --> 02:41:04,229
not Omri certified when something again

3361
02:41:02,370 --> 02:41:06,300
I'm gonna say it again when something is

3362
02:41:04,229 --> 02:41:07,318
Omri certified it doesn't mean that it's

3363
02:41:06,299 --> 02:41:09,658
organically

3364
02:41:07,318 --> 02:41:13,109
and it just means that it's registered

3365
02:41:09,658 --> 02:41:15,478
for organic use so a lot of these

3366
02:41:13,109 --> 02:41:18,209
awesome organic farmers even food

3367
02:41:15,478 --> 02:41:21,478
farmers are ordering these inputs that

3368
02:41:18,209 --> 02:41:23,220
are Omri certified and those inputs are

3369
02:41:21,478 --> 02:41:25,438
actually full of heavy metals and

3370
02:41:23,219 --> 02:41:27,778
toxicities that could fail your flowers

3371
02:41:25,439 --> 02:41:30,689
so we really need to be going beyond

3372
02:41:27,779 --> 02:41:33,300
that testing our inputs asking people

3373
02:41:30,689 --> 02:41:35,248
from the manufacturing that are offering

3374
02:41:33,299 --> 02:41:37,618
it to the farmers what are their tests

3375
02:41:35,248 --> 02:41:39,628
have you tested heavy metals have you

3376
02:41:37,619 --> 02:41:42,119
tested glyphosate glyphosate is

3377
02:41:39,629 --> 02:41:44,369
something that's not being tested but we

3378
02:41:42,119 --> 02:41:46,560
know over prolonged use if we're

3379
02:41:44,369 --> 02:41:48,600
continuing to add it into our soils it's

3380
02:41:46,559 --> 02:41:50,850
a fungicide it's killing our living

3381
02:41:48,600 --> 02:41:52,859
soils which is creating more problems

3382
02:41:50,850 --> 02:41:55,550
within our crops that makes us have to

3383
02:41:52,859 --> 02:41:58,680
add more things so this is why this

3384
02:41:55,549 --> 02:42:00,269
closed-loop regenerative farming is the

3385
02:41:58,680 --> 02:42:02,578
way to go for the future because we're

3386
02:42:00,270 --> 02:42:04,379
realizing through the testing you know

3387
02:42:02,578 --> 02:42:07,770
where our toxicity levels are even

3388
02:42:04,379 --> 02:42:09,959
coming from and if you're making a food

3389
02:42:07,770 --> 02:42:13,050
product or something with cannabis you

3390
02:42:09,959 --> 02:42:17,100
can have each input that you're getting

3391
02:42:13,049 --> 02:42:18,838
can be human grade toxicity tested a lot

3392
02:42:17,100 --> 02:42:20,729
of people just go for agricultural

3393
02:42:18,838 --> 02:42:23,969
testing but if you if you have all your

3394
02:42:20,728 --> 02:42:25,738
all your cacao or whatever it is tested

3395
02:42:23,969 --> 02:42:28,438
for human grade toxicity each

3396
02:42:25,738 --> 02:42:29,878
manufacturer should have batch tests for

3397
02:42:28,439 --> 02:42:31,859
everything that you buy and that would

3398
02:42:29,879 --> 02:42:34,319
be a good way to go that would eliminate

3399
02:42:31,859 --> 02:42:36,328
your potentially you'll need to have two

3400
02:42:34,318 --> 02:42:38,430
tests and you all wouldn't believe the

3401
02:42:36,328 --> 02:42:40,828
toxicity we have to human grade test

3402
02:42:38,430 --> 02:42:43,168
every single input that we put into all

3403
02:42:40,828 --> 02:42:44,850
of our products and then we also have

3404
02:42:43,168 --> 02:42:47,010
all that the people in the den peer

3405
02:42:44,850 --> 02:42:50,010
group if they want to do a testing and

3406
02:42:47,010 --> 02:42:51,719
we add it all into a big data form that

3407
02:42:50,010 --> 02:42:53,699
all of us can use and you wouldn't

3408
02:42:51,719 --> 02:42:54,748
believe the toxicity that's out there

3409
02:42:53,699 --> 02:42:58,470
the lead levels

3410
02:42:54,748 --> 02:43:01,020
unlike alfalfa that's Omri certified or

3411
02:42:58,469 --> 02:43:02,998
glyphosate levels on something that's

3412
02:43:01,020 --> 02:43:04,949
army certified these are things that go

3413
02:43:02,998 --> 02:43:07,350
into our soil and into our foliar sprays

3414
02:43:04,949 --> 02:43:09,869
that absolutely are failing our test so

3415
02:43:07,350 --> 02:43:12,390
it is the responsibility of the

3416
02:43:09,869 --> 02:43:14,729
cultivator from the very beginning to be

3417
02:43:12,389 --> 02:43:16,648
able to give good product to the

3418
02:43:14,728 --> 02:43:18,838
distributor so distributors don't have

3419
02:43:16,648 --> 02:43:20,479
these problems I think that we all need

3420
02:43:18,838 --> 02:43:22,851
to uphold our response

3421
02:43:20,479 --> 02:43:25,369
these distributors already have enough

3422
02:43:22,851 --> 02:43:27,560
paperwork money that they're putting out

3423
02:43:25,370 --> 02:43:31,040
that's making it almost impossible for

3424
02:43:27,560 --> 02:43:32,989
them to even exist in this reality so

3425
02:43:31,040 --> 02:43:34,940
it's up to us as cultivators to give

3426
02:43:32,989 --> 02:43:37,521
them a good clean product that we know

3427
02:43:34,940 --> 02:43:40,340
is going to pass the flower test and the

3428
02:43:37,521 --> 02:43:43,159
concentrate tests absolutely agree it's

3429
02:43:40,340 --> 02:43:44,989
it's a it's a it's a major

3430
02:43:43,159 --> 02:43:49,159
responsibility that we hold in our hands

3431
02:43:44,989 --> 02:43:50,989
it's so yeah it's you know I was also

3432
02:43:49,159 --> 02:43:54,560
gonna say that it's it's something that

3433
02:43:50,989 --> 02:43:58,250
we we should all welcome more clarity on

3434
02:43:54,560 --> 02:43:59,899
so it it helps us better understand what

3435
02:43:58,250 --> 02:44:20,329
we're putting into our plants and how

3436
02:43:59,899 --> 02:44:24,469
that's translating into the resin really

3437
02:44:20,329 --> 02:44:27,379
good yeah yeah I mean I've always worked

3438
02:44:24,469 --> 02:44:29,539
in regulated markets where third-party

3439
02:44:27,379 --> 02:44:31,359
testing is absolutely required for the

3440
02:44:29,540 --> 02:44:34,370
labeling language that goes on

3441
02:44:31,360 --> 02:44:36,110
concentrates so here's a jar that a

3442
02:44:34,370 --> 02:44:39,290
fifty-five dollar bottle of concentrate

3443
02:44:36,110 --> 02:44:42,470
a 1 gram concentrate goes on it's got

3444
02:44:39,290 --> 02:44:46,280
batch number up there let's see you guys

3445
02:44:42,469 --> 02:44:49,180
see this it's got terpene profile it's

3446
02:44:46,280 --> 02:44:49,181
got like you know

3447
02:44:49,329 --> 02:44:55,640
in Pennsylvania like in a lot of the

3448
02:44:52,280 --> 02:44:58,489
states they registered the testing labs

3449
02:44:55,640 --> 02:45:00,469
to make sure that again I don't know if

3450
02:44:58,489 --> 02:45:02,989
they have ISO certification for these

3451
02:45:00,469 --> 02:45:05,000
labs yet but certainly at some point

3452
02:45:02,989 --> 02:45:08,209
there will be an ISO certification

3453
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:11,540
process by which they go around and make

3454
02:45:08,209 --> 02:45:14,419
sure that the labs are generating you

3455
02:45:11,540 --> 02:45:15,920
know results that are real and make sure

3456
02:45:14,420 --> 02:45:17,960
their instruments are properly

3457
02:45:15,920 --> 02:45:20,710
calibrated and make sure that their

3458
02:45:17,959 --> 02:45:23,479
analytical methods are producing

3459
02:45:20,709 --> 02:45:26,989
reproducible stuff because again it it

3460
02:45:23,479 --> 02:45:28,969
all goes on to the label of the package

3461
02:45:26,989 --> 02:45:31,549
that ultimately gets sold to the

3462
02:45:28,969 --> 02:45:34,038
consumer so it's really important to

3463
02:45:31,549 --> 02:45:36,559
know that these labs are using

3464
02:45:34,039 --> 02:45:39,770
really good methods in both Pennsylvania

3465
02:45:36,559 --> 02:45:43,760
and in Maryland the lab actually sends

3466
02:45:39,770 --> 02:45:46,130
an individual to the production facility

3467
02:45:43,760 --> 02:45:49,059
where material is held you know in

3468
02:45:46,129 --> 02:45:53,538
quarantine it's not packaged until it's

3469
02:45:49,059 --> 02:45:55,969
basically tested and this state has

3470
02:45:53,539 --> 02:45:58,819
visibility on the certificates of

3471
02:45:55,969 --> 02:46:02,568
analysis for batches that are released

3472
02:45:58,818 --> 02:46:05,359
from production into packaging and so

3473
02:46:02,568 --> 02:46:07,488
it's a pretty tight process and I've

3474
02:46:05,359 --> 02:46:09,289
seen it just in the time that we've been

3475
02:46:07,488 --> 02:46:11,118
on hash search I know when we first

3476
02:46:09,289 --> 02:46:13,909
started hash search should we talked

3477
02:46:11,119 --> 02:46:16,640
about testing oh my god it was it was

3478
02:46:13,908 --> 02:46:19,398
horrible it was it was abysmal there

3479
02:46:16,639 --> 02:46:22,578
were labs that just were fly-by-night

3480
02:46:19,398 --> 02:46:25,309
operations that didn't arrive to do now

3481
02:46:22,578 --> 02:46:28,459
III think things have gotten a whole lot

3482
02:46:25,309 --> 02:46:31,398
better and I've had a great interactions

3483
02:46:28,459 --> 02:46:33,139
with several labs so I'm not gonna

3484
02:46:31,398 --> 02:46:35,809
mention any of them by names but I think

3485
02:46:33,139 --> 02:46:37,760
that it there's a lot of labs out there

3486
02:46:35,809 --> 02:46:42,288
again so it's a competitive environment

3487
02:46:37,760 --> 02:46:45,920
so shop around and yeah I mean for the

3488
02:46:42,289 --> 02:46:48,470
microbial analysis and for the other

3489
02:46:45,920 --> 02:46:50,029
stuff that you can't do you know that's

3490
02:46:48,469 --> 02:46:53,118
just something you have to rely on a

3491
02:46:50,029 --> 02:46:55,039
good third-party testing lab but all of

3492
02:46:53,119 --> 02:46:59,800
the production facilities that I've been

3493
02:46:55,039 --> 02:47:03,140
associated with we've all had in-house

3494
02:46:59,799 --> 02:47:05,568
analytical and if you're processing like

3495
02:47:03,139 --> 02:47:08,209
oil and distillate and making CBD and

3496
02:47:05,568 --> 02:47:11,059
isolates and diamonds and Shatter I

3497
02:47:08,209 --> 02:47:15,108
don't know how you operate without

3498
02:47:11,059 --> 02:47:17,090
having those instruments because you're

3499
02:47:15,109 --> 02:47:19,670
really flying blind if you don't know

3500
02:47:17,090 --> 02:47:21,680
what your cannabinoid levels are

3501
02:47:19,670 --> 02:47:24,170
especially in formulated products and

3502
02:47:21,680 --> 02:47:26,270
like I think Debbie and 18 we're saying

3503
02:47:24,170 --> 02:47:29,389
you know I mean again the onus used to

3504
02:47:26,270 --> 02:47:31,729
be sort of on the dispensary I guess to

3505
02:47:29,389 --> 02:47:34,788
make sure that the results were okay

3506
02:47:31,728 --> 02:47:38,028
there's exactly one point zero grams and

3507
02:47:34,789 --> 02:47:40,819
there's ninety six percent THC whatever

3508
02:47:38,029 --> 02:47:43,130
the you know percentages are and

3509
02:47:40,818 --> 02:47:46,488
everything like that now it seems as

3510
02:47:43,129 --> 02:47:47,549
though again the way that seed to sale

3511
02:47:46,488 --> 02:47:50,068
and vertical

3512
02:47:47,549 --> 02:47:52,978
Grayson's happened in States out east is

3513
02:47:50,068 --> 02:47:58,369
that everything is already in the system

3514
02:47:52,978 --> 02:48:01,289
like this batch of you know grapefruit

3515
02:47:58,370 --> 02:48:03,300
Durbin sugar which you know was

3516
02:48:01,290 --> 02:48:05,550
basically back to this barcode number

3517
02:48:03,299 --> 02:48:08,549
there I could probably scan that barcode

3518
02:48:05,549 --> 02:48:12,119
and tell you when that seed was popped

3519
02:48:08,549 --> 02:48:14,759
when that plant material was harvest

3520
02:48:12,120 --> 02:48:17,010
when that stuff was processed into lye

3521
02:48:14,760 --> 02:48:19,620
resin so it's gotten a lot better in

3522
02:48:17,010 --> 02:48:21,898
terms of just traceability and knowing

3523
02:48:19,620 --> 02:48:25,430
that again when the customer goes in and

3524
02:48:21,898 --> 02:48:27,959
buys a 55 dollar gram of sugar from a

3525
02:48:25,430 --> 02:48:30,450
dispensary what you're actually paying

3526
02:48:27,959 --> 02:48:32,879
because the test results are coming from

3527
02:48:30,450 --> 02:48:36,270
a lab that hopefully knows what the [ __ ]

3528
02:48:32,879 --> 02:48:39,029
you did I yeah this is what I got in

3529
02:48:36,270 --> 02:48:40,739
Maui last time I was on I went to the

3530
02:48:39,030 --> 02:48:43,979
other dispensary but this one I went is

3531
02:48:40,739 --> 02:48:48,739
the good dispensary when they actually

3532
02:48:43,978 --> 02:48:51,329
do it CSA to Chris said Maui grown much

3533
02:48:48,739 --> 02:48:55,439
this is a hashed Church watcher he might

3534
02:48:51,329 --> 02:48:58,170
be watching well great job Chris top

3535
02:48:55,439 --> 02:49:00,300
operation and of course they do it from

3536
02:48:58,170 --> 02:49:03,090
absolutely seed to sale so they actually

3537
02:49:00,299 --> 02:49:06,449
have a lab on site and do everything

3538
02:49:03,090 --> 02:49:08,489
proper and if again if you have a state

3539
02:49:06,450 --> 02:49:10,890
card and you go to Maui you just have to

3540
02:49:08,489 --> 02:49:16,770
or any Highway lost eighty and how much

3541
02:49:10,889 --> 02:49:20,129
that cost nothing what's a retail 400

3542
02:49:16,770 --> 02:49:21,930
this here no this was um I forget what

3543
02:49:20,129 --> 02:49:34,799
it was it was around oh hold on I got

3544
02:49:21,930 --> 02:49:39,090
the receipt this was the local Barry

3545
02:49:34,799 --> 02:49:40,799
diesel it was I got a ten percent

3546
02:49:39,090 --> 02:49:45,898
discount so it was 44 dollars and

3547
02:49:40,799 --> 02:49:49,438
sixteen cents so four hey four yeah it's

3548
02:49:45,898 --> 02:49:53,608
uh it was wax huckleberry diesel eighty

3549
02:49:49,439 --> 02:49:56,130
percent THC tested by so you know it's

3550
02:49:53,609 --> 02:49:58,380
lab tested and so it has a batch number

3551
02:49:56,129 --> 02:50:00,148
the same as when I got married in Alaska

3552
02:49:58,379 --> 02:50:01,049
and the dispensaries there in Alaska

3553
02:50:00,148 --> 02:50:03,059
there

3554
02:50:01,049 --> 02:50:05,670
doing the same thing it's just they have

3555
02:50:03,059 --> 02:50:09,510
to literally send it on a flight all the

3556
02:50:05,670 --> 02:50:12,478
way to Alaska to know where the actual

3557
02:50:09,510 --> 02:50:14,489
which is the only lab there whereas in

3558
02:50:12,478 --> 02:50:16,199
Hawaii the labs have to be on each

3559
02:50:14,489 --> 02:50:18,809
Island where the dispensaries are

3560
02:50:16,200 --> 02:50:22,439
because they cannot take their cannabis

3561
02:50:18,809 --> 02:50:25,170
inter-island it has to be where it is so

3562
02:50:22,439 --> 02:50:27,239
as challenging because it indices a

3563
02:50:25,170 --> 02:50:28,829
federal law then because no matter by

3564
02:50:27,239 --> 02:50:30,898
air or by water you're still dealing

3565
02:50:28,829 --> 02:50:38,670
with the vets so is that was that a gram

3566
02:50:30,898 --> 02:50:40,409
a half gram yeah it was a half gram yeah

3567
02:50:38,670 --> 02:50:44,370
be careful you were just mentioning

3568
02:50:40,409 --> 02:50:46,770
inner island and we just wanted to make

3569
02:50:44,370 --> 02:50:49,290
sure to be careful because allah who is

3570
02:50:46,770 --> 02:50:51,600
an international airport and because

3571
02:50:49,290 --> 02:50:54,479
they actually dealing with agricultural

3572
02:50:51,600 --> 02:50:58,470
cameras and a whole lot of agricultural

3573
02:50:54,478 --> 02:51:00,688
people it's a different type of look see

3574
02:50:58,469 --> 02:51:04,049
so please everybody who's going through

3575
02:51:00,689 --> 02:51:09,389
oahu without hawaii cannabis medical

3576
02:51:04,049 --> 02:51:11,789
license yeah and and you know no no be

3577
02:51:09,389 --> 02:51:13,500
really careful about it and also I could

3578
02:51:11,790 --> 02:51:16,680
tell you on the other end is they don't

3579
02:51:13,500 --> 02:51:18,568
have testing at the airport gelatin so

3580
02:51:16,680 --> 02:51:21,079
just want to let you all know that -

3581
02:51:18,568 --> 02:51:24,209
there is no testing and a Wahoo airport

3582
02:51:21,079 --> 02:51:31,340
and don't travel with anything people be

3583
02:51:24,209 --> 02:51:36,269
smart if you can don't be like us is

3584
02:51:31,340 --> 02:51:41,059
test more varieties of terpenes because

3585
02:51:36,270 --> 02:51:41,060
most labs the most ever see is about 15

3586
02:51:42,010 --> 02:51:48,860
mark Sam go ahead sorry good no go ahead

3587
02:51:45,739 --> 02:51:51,709
I go ahead use that go ahead no I was

3588
02:51:48,860 --> 02:51:54,021
they can certainly test for mortar pians

3589
02:51:51,709 --> 02:51:56,539
but i think like even if you look at

3590
02:51:54,021 --> 02:51:59,180
this label right here they have I think

3591
02:51:56,540 --> 02:52:01,670
six of them on there I don't know how

3592
02:51:59,180 --> 02:52:04,489
many more you know you can actually fit

3593
02:52:01,670 --> 02:52:06,979
on a small little label I mean and and

3594
02:52:04,489 --> 02:52:08,690
then the real question becomes like you

3595
02:52:06,979 --> 02:52:10,909
know with concentrates it's one thing

3596
02:52:08,690 --> 02:52:12,920
and flour it's just you know a

3597
02:52:10,909 --> 02:52:15,170
completely different beast because it's

3598
02:52:12,920 --> 02:52:17,560
much more dilute you know but I'm

3599
02:52:15,170 --> 02:52:21,649
concentrate yeah you could probably

3600
02:52:17,560 --> 02:52:23,569
reproducibly have like a list of ten to

3601
02:52:21,649 --> 02:52:26,390
twelve to maybe even fifteen terpenes

3602
02:52:23,569 --> 02:52:28,489
there's a real problem with you know

3603
02:52:26,390 --> 02:52:31,789
labeling and labeling and surface

3604
02:52:28,489 --> 02:52:35,899
because there's so much verbage that has

3605
02:52:31,790 --> 02:52:37,610
to be put on by you know standards right

3606
02:52:35,899 --> 02:52:39,260
you know companies are doing interesting

3607
02:52:37,610 --> 02:52:41,329
things like putting you know the

3608
02:52:39,260 --> 02:52:44,000
terpenes that are in there on the inside

3609
02:52:41,329 --> 02:52:47,659
flap you know so there is a little bit

3610
02:52:44,000 --> 02:52:51,489
of that happening we all here pretty

3611
02:52:47,659 --> 02:52:54,340
much know that if you know what the

3612
02:52:51,489 --> 02:53:00,079
cannabinoid percentages are specimens

3613
02:52:54,340 --> 02:53:03,319
like many cases just THC and the terpene

3614
02:53:00,079 --> 02:53:04,909
profile and percentages you can guess

3615
02:53:03,319 --> 02:53:09,319
pretty much what the effects are gonna

3616
02:53:04,909 --> 02:53:11,209
be like please I can you can close yeah

3617
02:53:09,319 --> 02:53:13,760
yeah I think we need a measurement of

3618
02:53:11,209 --> 02:53:15,770
like 20 or 21 turkey and so I want to

3619
02:53:13,760 --> 02:53:18,500
say I should look at some date of it I

3620
02:53:15,771 --> 02:53:20,630
think that's what we normally yeah but

3621
02:53:18,500 --> 02:53:22,909
then yeah we have to like take like a

3622
02:53:20,629 --> 02:53:25,039
sub group of that and put them on a

3623
02:53:22,909 --> 02:53:31,909
label because you can only put so many

3624
02:53:25,040 --> 02:53:35,391
you know yeah so mark yeah I'm seeing 26

3625
02:53:31,909 --> 02:53:38,780
right now where I state that i'm i'm

3626
02:53:35,390 --> 02:53:42,799
currently in right now it it was i was

3627
02:53:38,780 --> 02:53:45,620
told that you know anywhere from 15 to

3628
02:53:42,799 --> 02:53:48,489
20 26 but I'm seeing on and most of the

3629
02:53:45,620 --> 02:53:48,490
tests that are coming back

3630
02:53:54,629 --> 02:53:59,459
that's that's what that insight would be

3631
02:53:57,148 --> 02:54:01,709
amazing you know and I I really look

3632
02:53:59,459 --> 02:54:04,589
forward to the time that we can get that

3633
02:54:01,709 --> 02:54:07,889
type of that type of data back because

3634
02:54:04,590 --> 02:54:09,568
it'll just allow us to look at it in a

3635
02:54:07,889 --> 02:54:12,478
different way in the lab you know which

3636
02:54:09,568 --> 02:54:14,100
I really look forward to and I'm using

3637
02:54:12,478 --> 02:54:17,688
as much as that information as we can

3638
02:54:14,100 --> 02:54:20,670
now but it's there's so much more as

3639
02:54:17,689 --> 02:54:23,369
interesting is information is that is to

3640
02:54:20,670 --> 02:54:26,068
us you know us purist and as people who

3641
02:54:23,369 --> 02:54:28,829
want to know that I mean ultimately like

3642
02:54:26,068 --> 02:54:32,309
for business reasons you know it's

3643
02:54:28,829 --> 02:54:34,379
gotten those solvent cell you know like

3644
02:54:32,309 --> 02:54:37,318
I mean if it meets the minimum

3645
02:54:34,379 --> 02:54:41,129
requirements to get it out the door the

3646
02:54:37,318 --> 02:54:44,010
the the investment that's been made to

3647
02:54:41,129 --> 02:54:46,679
get the product to that form we're just

3648
02:54:44,010 --> 02:54:48,840
waiting to be packaged you know we need

3649
02:54:46,680 --> 02:54:52,139
to be grabbed out and waiting to be sold

3650
02:54:48,840 --> 02:54:54,540
is just get that stuff out you know and

3651
02:54:52,139 --> 02:54:57,750
put something on the label just to make

3652
02:54:54,540 --> 02:55:00,630
us compliant you know and compliance I

3653
02:54:57,750 --> 02:55:03,420
mean you know yeah I guess the industry

3654
02:55:00,629 --> 02:55:05,969
has forced us into this this is the way

3655
02:55:03,420 --> 02:55:08,520
we have to do it you know like when they

3656
02:55:05,969 --> 02:55:10,500
send a representative from the testing

3657
02:55:08,520 --> 02:55:12,180
lab I mean think about that some of

3658
02:55:10,500 --> 02:55:14,430
these cannabis facilities that they're

3659
02:55:12,180 --> 02:55:17,040
putting in they're putting into areas

3660
02:55:14,430 --> 02:55:19,318
where you know there's been a real hit

3661
02:55:17,040 --> 02:55:22,080
on the economy and you know some of

3662
02:55:19,318 --> 02:55:23,760
these mill towns like in Massachusetts

3663
02:55:22,079 --> 02:55:26,369
or you know Pennsylvania you could

3664
02:55:23,760 --> 02:55:28,680
imagine that you know putting a cannabis

3665
02:55:26,369 --> 02:55:31,350
production facility in that area is just

3666
02:55:28,680 --> 02:55:33,420
a big economic shot in the arm because

3667
02:55:31,350 --> 02:55:35,790
now you have these production jobs

3668
02:55:33,420 --> 02:55:38,790
you're producing a high quality product

3669
02:55:35,790 --> 02:55:41,640
but the testing labs typically has

3670
02:55:38,790 --> 02:55:43,409
always been around population centers

3671
02:55:41,639 --> 02:55:46,019
right so if you think about like

3672
02:55:43,408 --> 02:55:48,779
Pennsylvania just for example population

3673
02:55:46,020 --> 02:55:50,609
centers out west you have Pittsburgh and

3674
02:55:48,779 --> 02:55:52,649
out east you have Philly in the middle

3675
02:55:50,609 --> 02:55:55,680
you have what we cancel duckie right and

3676
02:55:52,648 --> 02:55:57,539
pencil junkies for bus that the most of

3677
02:55:55,680 --> 02:56:00,359
the production goes on but the testing

3678
02:55:57,540 --> 02:56:03,600
is elsewhere so just that the logistics

3679
02:56:00,359 --> 02:56:07,350
of having to get testing personnel

3680
02:56:03,600 --> 02:56:08,870
they're all gound up in a facility you

3681
02:56:07,350 --> 02:56:10,280
know badged in

3682
02:56:08,870 --> 02:56:12,440
and it in they probably have to have a

3683
02:56:10,280 --> 02:56:15,230
background check to let somebody in

3684
02:56:12,440 --> 02:56:17,510
those facilities because now who they're

3685
02:56:15,229 --> 02:56:19,189
touching the cannabis you know so they

3686
02:56:17,510 --> 02:56:21,351
actually have to go in there and take

3687
02:56:19,190 --> 02:56:24,110
these samples and then bring them back

3688
02:56:21,351 --> 02:56:26,510
to you know the lab which is 50 miles

3689
02:56:24,110 --> 02:56:28,130
away or 80 miles away or God knows how

3690
02:56:26,510 --> 02:56:30,800
many you know so just the whole

3691
02:56:28,129 --> 02:56:32,689
logistics of that holds up production

3692
02:56:30,799 --> 02:56:35,090
because as you're producing and as

3693
02:56:32,690 --> 02:56:37,069
you're growing and extracting and making

3694
02:56:35,090 --> 02:56:41,780
product and making formulated product

3695
02:56:37,069 --> 02:56:44,659
ultimately you're at the you know mercy

3696
02:56:41,780 --> 02:56:46,430
of the regulation that's in the state to

3697
02:56:44,659 --> 02:56:49,489
keep your license to make sure you're

3698
02:56:46,430 --> 02:56:51,829
operating compliantly and you have all

3699
02:56:49,489 --> 02:56:54,021
the information that needs to go on the

3700
02:56:51,829 --> 02:56:57,379
label so that product can be legally

3701
02:56:54,021 --> 02:57:00,860
stored or if sold at the dispensaries I

3702
02:56:57,379 --> 02:57:04,520
mean it's it's a lot it's a lot yeah

3703
02:57:00,860 --> 02:57:06,829
it is industry is regulated and it's

3704
02:57:04,521 --> 02:57:08,690
always interesting to transpose the

3705
02:57:06,829 --> 02:57:10,729
alcohol industry on to the cannabis

3706
02:57:08,690 --> 02:57:13,399
industry path well what would they do

3707
02:57:10,729 --> 02:57:15,799
you know with alcohol here I mean how

3708
02:57:13,399 --> 02:57:17,899
would they regulate alcohol and I think

3709
02:57:15,799 --> 02:57:20,449
that that's like really very very

3710
02:57:17,899 --> 02:57:23,810
pertinent around hemp because you know

3711
02:57:20,450 --> 02:57:26,240
hemp was made legal right so that the

3712
02:57:23,810 --> 02:57:29,329
farm bill basically said you know these

3713
02:57:26,239 --> 02:57:31,729
varieties of cannabis where you have low

3714
02:57:29,329 --> 02:57:34,789
THC cultivars and you just basically

3715
02:57:31,729 --> 02:57:37,899
only makin CBD these things are now

3716
02:57:34,790 --> 02:57:40,730
legal but now what complicates things

3717
02:57:37,899 --> 02:57:42,079
always right I think they're never as

3718
02:57:40,729 --> 02:57:45,139
easy as they're at they they're supposed

3719
02:57:42,079 --> 02:57:49,039
to be is the fact that even on an acre

3720
02:57:45,139 --> 02:57:51,289
of that point three hemp you have

3721
02:57:49,040 --> 02:57:56,120
somewhere between three to six pounds of

3722
02:57:51,290 --> 02:57:59,450
THC do they forget that oh yeah we don't

3723
02:57:56,120 --> 02:58:00,710
talk about that mark that's we don't

3724
02:57:59,450 --> 02:58:03,021
that's we don't know we don't talk about

3725
02:58:00,709 --> 02:58:09,619
that so we don't change the subject now

3726
02:58:03,021 --> 02:58:12,950
okay joking like a big driver now in a

3727
02:58:09,620 --> 02:58:16,090
hemp industry is is having tea free

3728
02:58:12,950 --> 02:58:19,340
product or what's called THC free

3729
02:58:16,090 --> 02:58:21,950
distillate for being able to again be

3730
02:58:19,340 --> 02:58:22,949
complying with the farm bill because

3731
02:58:21,950 --> 02:58:25,979
again in the farm bill

3732
02:58:22,949 --> 02:58:31,529
you're basically saying that this

3733
02:58:25,978 --> 02:58:34,559
product is is is is is legal so

3734
02:58:31,529 --> 02:58:36,479
therefore any thing extracted from the

3735
02:58:34,559 --> 02:58:39,090
product is legal even if it's

3736
02:58:36,478 --> 02:58:42,329
fractionated to a point where now the

3737
02:58:39,090 --> 02:58:45,568
percentages make them not legal how is

3738
02:58:42,329 --> 02:58:48,689
that dealt with in a way that becomes

3739
02:58:45,568 --> 02:58:50,579
you know regulatory compliance so yeah

3740
02:58:48,689 --> 02:58:52,380
Marcus I'm sorry I don't know how every

3741
02:58:50,579 --> 02:58:54,209
state is different and that's what's

3742
02:58:52,379 --> 02:58:58,259
really confusing about it right now they

3743
02:58:54,209 --> 02:59:00,889
changed the tota the HC limit in the US

3744
02:58:58,260 --> 02:59:06,180
and that's what really on October 31st

3745
02:59:00,889 --> 02:59:08,849
and so it kind of sent you know industry

3746
02:59:06,180 --> 02:59:10,829
for a loop in the US right cuz I don't

3747
02:59:08,850 --> 02:59:13,738
know what what what are they doing with

3748
02:59:10,829 --> 02:59:16,139
the recovered THC so the point is is no

3749
02:59:13,738 --> 02:59:20,068
matter how low they make the limit if

3750
02:59:16,139 --> 02:59:23,939
they're still going to be THC as part of

3751
02:59:20,068 --> 02:59:27,148
the fraction of stuff that comes from

3752
02:59:23,939 --> 02:59:29,488
that extraction how do you how is that

3753
02:59:27,148 --> 02:59:31,769
regulating how is it dealt with they

3754
02:59:29,488 --> 02:59:34,559
just give you a minimum number of what's

3755
02:59:31,770 --> 02:59:36,870
available and they allow you to operate

3756
02:59:34,559 --> 02:59:38,459
and then you've got all this excess THC

3757
02:59:36,870 --> 02:59:40,970
but you're supposed to be hand farmer

3758
02:59:38,459 --> 02:59:43,528
you're not supposed to have that THC

3759
02:59:40,969 --> 02:59:48,629
what Marcus said and we're just not

3760
02:59:43,529 --> 02:59:50,220
going to talk about that today the one

3761
02:59:48,629 --> 02:59:52,019
percent because that's what good

3762
02:59:50,219 --> 02:59:54,028
medicine is the whole idea that we're

3763
02:59:52,020 --> 02:59:55,829
gonna be producing a high and getting

3764
02:59:54,029 --> 02:59:59,430
medicine out to the masses is really

3765
02:59:55,829 --> 03:00:02,879
kind of not worth it so whole plant

3766
02:59:59,430 --> 03:00:05,309
medicine with THC numbers that are in

3767
03:00:02,879 --> 03:00:08,398
the regulations is really what we're

3768
03:00:05,309 --> 03:00:11,459
looking for we need endo Finnick fungi

3769
03:00:08,398 --> 03:00:13,559
and bacteria along with cannabinoids and

3770
03:00:11,459 --> 03:00:15,568
europeans in our medicine in order to

3771
03:00:13,559 --> 03:00:19,079
make proper hemp medicine so I'm really

3772
03:00:15,568 --> 03:00:21,568
excited about new studies coming out

3773
03:00:19,079 --> 03:00:23,488
about the effects of endo FIDIC fungi

3774
03:00:21,568 --> 03:00:26,309
and endo Finnick bacteria that are

3775
03:00:23,488 --> 03:00:28,318
present within the plant that are

3776
03:00:26,309 --> 03:00:30,629
outside of the realms of cannabinoids

3777
03:00:28,318 --> 03:00:32,939
and Inter beans that are actually

3778
03:00:30,629 --> 03:00:34,479
produced incredibly medicinal and I

3779
03:00:32,939 --> 03:00:35,890
we've we've talked about it on here

3780
03:00:34,479 --> 03:00:38,261
before but you know there are newer

3781
03:00:35,890 --> 03:00:40,869
studies and there's not a lot known

3782
03:00:38,261 --> 03:00:43,479
about endo FIDIC fungi and endo FIDIC

3783
03:00:40,870 --> 03:00:45,881
bacteria in cannabis at the moment there

3784
03:00:43,479 --> 03:00:48,550
are some hemp studies done and you can

3785
03:00:45,880 --> 03:00:52,960
extract endo fitted fungi and bacteria

3786
03:00:48,550 --> 03:00:54,250
and create products like antifungal

3787
03:00:52,960 --> 03:00:55,810
sprays and different things like that

3788
03:00:54,250 --> 03:00:58,540
but it's it's an affront

3789
03:00:55,810 --> 03:01:00,671
he's got term endo Finnick explain what

3790
03:00:58,540 --> 03:01:03,160
that term means I don't even know what

3791
03:01:00,671 --> 03:01:05,739
that term know endo as you know being a

3792
03:01:03,159 --> 03:01:08,610
scientist means inside and siddik

3793
03:01:05,739 --> 03:01:11,739
meaning fungi so it's actually the

3794
03:01:08,610 --> 03:01:15,011
microbiome of the plant you talk a lot

3795
03:01:11,739 --> 03:01:16,780
about the microbiome of the soil but now

3796
03:01:15,011 --> 03:01:18,640
we're really starting to look into the

3797
03:01:16,780 --> 03:01:20,021
microbiome of the plant which is the

3798
03:01:18,640 --> 03:01:21,729
education that Josh and I've been

3799
03:01:20,021 --> 03:01:24,431
talking about forever but now it's just

3800
03:01:21,729 --> 03:01:26,560
being matched you know with people that

3801
03:01:24,431 --> 03:01:28,480
are looking at cannabis and studying the

3802
03:01:26,560 --> 03:01:34,829
endo FIDIC reaction because what we know

3803
03:01:28,479 --> 03:01:38,591
of the yew tree and the production of

3804
03:01:34,829 --> 03:01:40,841
taxall was it wasn't just the cambium

3805
03:01:38,591 --> 03:01:42,640
layer inside of the tree that was was

3806
03:01:40,841 --> 03:01:45,101
giving the taxol which is the medicinal

3807
03:01:42,640 --> 03:01:46,869
compounds it was the end of fights that

3808
03:01:45,101 --> 03:01:49,271
were inside of the tree that were

3809
03:01:46,870 --> 03:01:50,650
creating the medicine so now we're

3810
03:01:49,271 --> 03:01:53,051
really starting to understand the

3811
03:01:50,649 --> 03:01:55,750
microbiome of the plant producing the

3812
03:01:53,050 --> 03:01:58,810
cannabinoids and the terpenes and the

3813
03:01:55,750 --> 03:02:01,030
medicine and no fights are coming from

3814
03:01:58,810 --> 03:02:04,569
the soil and outside they're going into

3815
03:02:01,030 --> 03:02:07,239
the plant through the the plant blood

3816
03:02:04,569 --> 03:02:09,039
they're going into the leaves the shoots

3817
03:02:07,239 --> 03:02:10,899
the roots all different aspects of the

3818
03:02:09,040 --> 03:02:17,711
place they go into the cells and they're

3819
03:02:10,899 --> 03:02:20,020
like a free associating compound that

3820
03:02:17,710 --> 03:02:22,569
goes into the plant so endophytes are

3821
03:02:20,021 --> 03:02:24,940
really really interesting and there is

3822
03:02:22,569 --> 03:02:27,789
some you know new information coming out

3823
03:02:24,940 --> 03:02:30,280
on on hemp plants and extracting

3824
03:02:27,790 --> 03:02:32,771
endophytes and just like when we find

3825
03:02:30,280 --> 03:02:34,900
what we have now in the scientific

3826
03:02:32,771 --> 03:02:37,271
frontier is that when we're testing

3827
03:02:34,899 --> 03:02:39,671
people's microbiome which is their

3828
03:02:37,271 --> 03:02:41,859
microbiome their and acidic system is

3829
03:02:39,671 --> 03:02:44,078
that there's cancers and

3830
03:02:41,859 --> 03:02:46,748
IBS and Crohn's disease and all of these

3831
03:02:44,078 --> 03:02:48,189
horrible maladies that humans are facing

3832
03:02:46,748 --> 03:02:50,619
right now well when we test the

3833
03:02:48,189 --> 03:02:53,050
microbiome of the human were realizing a

3834
03:02:50,619 --> 03:02:56,590
tremendous amount of beneficial end

3835
03:02:53,049 --> 03:02:58,988
fights or microbiology that's not

3836
03:02:56,590 --> 03:03:01,510
present within the humans and now we can

3837
03:02:58,988 --> 03:03:05,049
take the studies to the cannabis plant

3838
03:03:01,510 --> 03:03:07,930
and realize okay if there is you know

3839
03:03:05,049 --> 03:03:10,090
leaf eating mildew that's happening we

3840
03:03:07,930 --> 03:03:12,639
can look within the microbiome to see

3841
03:03:10,090 --> 03:03:14,619
what is missing within the plant that

3842
03:03:12,639 --> 03:03:16,840
helps really fight that off and josh

3843
03:03:14,619 --> 03:03:19,239
said that it's found within the soil but

3844
03:03:16,840 --> 03:03:22,359
there's also a DNA twist in it just like

3845
03:03:19,238 --> 03:03:26,260
humans that there's also endophytes that

3846
03:03:22,359 --> 03:03:28,390
are coming within the seeds so it seems

3847
03:03:26,260 --> 03:03:37,328
to be carried on not only through DNA

3848
03:03:28,389 --> 03:03:38,078
but also through environmental well

3849
03:03:37,328 --> 03:03:42,208
thanks for sharing

3850
03:03:38,078 --> 03:03:46,840
I'm Derek James well I love that term

3851
03:03:42,209 --> 03:03:51,729
yeah Uncle Phil there's a regenerative

3852
03:03:46,840 --> 03:03:53,228
agriculture podcast on with Jane dr.

3853
03:03:51,728 --> 03:03:55,389
white you can listen to it's really

3854
03:03:53,228 --> 03:03:57,158
interesting and he's gonna be speaking

3855
03:03:55,389 --> 03:04:00,639
at the science regenerative cannabis

3856
03:03:57,158 --> 03:04:02,318
conference coming up soon and you know

3857
03:04:00,639 --> 03:04:07,269
he's been studying I know fights for 40

3858
03:04:02,318 --> 03:04:12,189
years and so is dr. Ephron's and an

3859
03:04:07,270 --> 03:04:14,590
Oregon with mycorrhizae fungi and it's

3860
03:04:12,189 --> 03:04:17,289
really interesting how the roots have

3861
03:04:14,590 --> 03:04:21,039
the fungal filaments hairs and how those

3862
03:04:17,289 --> 03:04:23,020
hairs exude the compounds that attract

3863
03:04:21,039 --> 03:04:26,020
the bacteria and fungi to them and then

3864
03:04:23,020 --> 03:04:28,569
they dissolve and and synthesize those

3865
03:04:26,020 --> 03:04:30,369
compounds into the fungal filaments and

3866
03:04:28,568 --> 03:04:31,988
they put them into themselves and they

3867
03:04:30,369 --> 03:04:36,220
pulsed that medicine through them

3868
03:04:31,988 --> 03:04:38,648
through the the plant and so it creates

3869
03:04:36,219 --> 03:04:41,049
nutrients and it creates medicine within

3870
03:04:38,648 --> 03:04:44,078
the plants so yes we can grow a plant

3871
03:04:41,049 --> 03:04:47,108
hydroponically no we won't have as much

3872
03:04:44,078 --> 03:04:49,478
endophytes and as much nutrients within

3873
03:04:47,109 --> 03:04:53,949
the tomato plant or the cannabis plant

3874
03:04:49,478 --> 03:04:55,600
so it's this complex matrix of rich soil

3875
03:04:53,949 --> 03:04:57,610
that allows the

3876
03:04:55,601 --> 03:05:00,011
it's to become more complex and create

3877
03:04:57,610 --> 03:05:02,261
more nutrient-dense more medicine in our

3878
03:05:00,011 --> 03:05:05,771
plants and that's the goal of our whole

3879
03:05:02,261 --> 03:05:08,171
entire succession of our species that's

3880
03:05:05,771 --> 03:05:10,450
the point of evolution that we can't

3881
03:05:08,171 --> 03:05:12,399
lose that's what's happening in the

3882
03:05:10,450 --> 03:05:14,081
forest that's what's happening in our

3883
03:05:12,399 --> 03:05:17,199
wild areas and that's what we need to

3884
03:05:14,081 --> 03:05:19,601
try and create biomimicry in our in our

3885
03:05:17,200 --> 03:05:22,061
Gardens in moving forward and we think

3886
03:05:19,601 --> 03:05:23,891
that's the the work and the succeed

3887
03:05:22,060 --> 03:05:26,520
that's how we're smart that's how our

3888
03:05:23,890 --> 03:05:30,609
brain can function properly so that's

3889
03:05:26,521 --> 03:05:32,530
organic soil intentional production

3890
03:05:30,610 --> 03:05:35,501
going into plants and then coming out

3891
03:05:32,530 --> 03:05:37,541
with products that can heal the masses

3892
03:05:35,501 --> 03:05:40,149
and then you can even take it one step

3893
03:05:37,540 --> 03:05:43,479
further and you could say that you know

3894
03:05:40,149 --> 03:05:45,940
if we're finding in is you know people

3895
03:05:43,479 --> 03:05:48,550
that have heavy maladies improper

3896
03:05:45,940 --> 03:05:50,921
balanced microbiome then what what

3897
03:05:48,550 --> 03:05:52,630
happens if we all get back to soil what

3898
03:05:50,921 --> 03:05:55,001
happens if we're all playing in the soil

3899
03:05:52,630 --> 03:05:57,369
and we're just even growing our tomatoes

3900
03:05:55,001 --> 03:05:59,710
in our own backyard then we're able to

3901
03:05:57,370 --> 03:06:01,841
uptake that microbiology and we're

3902
03:05:59,710 --> 03:06:04,239
realizing that that microbiology that

3903
03:06:01,841 --> 03:06:06,640
comes from the soil is a tremendous

3904
03:06:04,239 --> 03:06:08,351
intelligence so not only is it going

3905
03:06:06,640 --> 03:06:11,171
into our body and it's helping us to

3906
03:06:08,351 --> 03:06:14,261
heal maladies but it's also helping us

3907
03:06:11,171 --> 03:06:16,720
to make proper decisions and I believe

3908
03:06:14,261 --> 03:06:19,450
that us as a species you know maybe

3909
03:06:16,720 --> 03:06:22,180
we're making a lot of improper decisions

3910
03:06:19,450 --> 03:06:25,360
because a lot of us are hosting the

3911
03:06:22,181 --> 03:06:27,851
composting microbiology the ones are the

3912
03:06:25,360 --> 03:06:34,060
heavy-duty pathogens you know maybe we

3913
03:06:27,851 --> 03:06:37,001
need more beneficials come a super

3914
03:06:34,060 --> 03:06:39,040
t-cell and and and enhance that within

3915
03:06:37,001 --> 03:06:40,751
our body and it starts now it's

3916
03:06:39,040 --> 03:06:42,939
springtime so we're about ready to start

3917
03:06:40,751 --> 03:06:45,671
seeds we're about ready to take clones

3918
03:06:42,940 --> 03:06:50,319
we should talk as a community how do we

3919
03:06:45,671 --> 03:06:52,890
start seeds without the e watches and

3920
03:06:50,319 --> 03:06:56,529
crazy things we need a star seeds with

3921
03:06:52,890 --> 03:06:59,020
Ultima no not Impala G possible so when

3922
03:06:56,530 --> 03:07:01,870
the first root comes out it's going to

3923
03:06:59,021 --> 03:07:02,501
take a DNA imprint of what's possible in

3924
03:07:01,870 --> 03:07:05,320
that soil

3925
03:07:02,501 --> 03:07:08,969
so we're saying start your seeds with a

3926
03:07:05,319 --> 03:07:13,129
moon cycle we're saying start clones in

3927
03:07:08,969 --> 03:07:15,898
natural soil don't use rapid rooters and

3928
03:07:13,129 --> 03:07:18,929
spongy clone mediums because those

3929
03:07:15,898 --> 03:07:21,510
spongy clone mediums are not approved

3930
03:07:18,930 --> 03:07:25,909
for organic agriculture most of those

3931
03:07:21,510 --> 03:07:28,409
spongy clone mediums have inorganic

3932
03:07:25,909 --> 03:07:30,209
compounds that are used as binders which

3933
03:07:28,409 --> 03:07:32,700
we talked about before those monitors

3934
03:07:30,209 --> 03:07:34,738
with the polymers heavy-duty polymers

3935
03:07:32,700 --> 03:07:36,390
and those that make some spongy as well

3936
03:07:34,738 --> 03:07:39,209
as formaldehyde which keeps it a

3937
03:07:36,389 --> 03:07:41,278
preservative so root riot and rapid

3938
03:07:39,209 --> 03:07:44,039
rooters are not approved for organic

3939
03:07:41,279 --> 03:07:47,760
agriculture we should be looking to make

3940
03:07:44,040 --> 03:07:52,470
clones with soil blockers and create our

3941
03:07:47,760 --> 03:07:56,100
own mix of maybe a coco compost 50/50

3942
03:07:52,469 --> 03:07:58,519
blend or a peat coco 50/50 blend or our

3943
03:07:56,100 --> 03:08:01,399
own dirt from our our greenhouse

3944
03:07:58,520 --> 03:08:03,300
fifty-fifty blunt or it's not super

3945
03:08:01,398 --> 03:08:05,608
biological Ridge because you don't want

3946
03:08:03,299 --> 03:08:07,590
to eat up the stem with biology when you

3947
03:08:05,609 --> 03:08:10,318
put it in there but you want to kind of

3948
03:08:07,590 --> 03:08:12,478
halfway inert mix for clones so I did

3949
03:08:10,318 --> 03:08:15,590
we're opening up the the conversation

3950
03:08:12,478 --> 03:08:17,849
towards how to start clones and seeds

3951
03:08:15,590 --> 03:08:22,549
biologically for the betterment of

3952
03:08:17,850 --> 03:08:22,550
healthy medicine and nutrition

3953
03:08:22,818 --> 03:08:27,148
thanks for the drop that was awesome in

3954
03:08:25,379 --> 03:08:29,849
fact everyone thanks for the drop today

3955
03:08:27,148 --> 03:08:31,439
is like some good good information going

3956
03:08:29,850 --> 03:08:34,859
down on hash Church it's been three

3957
03:08:31,439 --> 03:08:36,809
hours and I'm gonna call it call it a

3958
03:08:34,859 --> 03:08:39,479
day for the first hash Church backing

3959
03:08:36,809 --> 03:08:41,639
since the hacking definitely gonna come

3960
03:08:39,478 --> 03:08:43,139
back next week and invite all of you and

3961
03:08:41,639 --> 03:08:46,049
anyone else that wants to come and join

3962
03:08:43,139 --> 03:08:49,039
us this zoom allows us to have many many

3963
03:08:46,049 --> 03:08:52,139
more people in the room than the old

3964
03:08:49,040 --> 03:08:53,609
methodology but thanks to dragon fire

3965
03:08:52,139 --> 03:08:55,920
with medicine for dropping in and

3966
03:08:53,609 --> 03:08:58,260
dropping bombs and knowledge and just

3967
03:08:55,920 --> 03:09:01,350
being all-around good folks and thank

3968
03:08:58,260 --> 03:09:03,630
you yeah thank you as well Jack Phillips

3969
03:09:01,350 --> 03:09:05,460
you know for the short share we'll get

3970
03:09:03,629 --> 03:09:06,988
you back again next week to you can tell

3971
03:09:05,459 --> 03:09:08,669
us more about what's going on and what

3972
03:09:06,988 --> 03:09:12,719
you're doing and it's [ __ ] super

3973
03:09:08,670 --> 03:09:16,469
awesome work nobody's in denial of what

3974
03:09:12,719 --> 03:09:18,599
you're doing is is the front lines front

3975
03:09:16,469 --> 03:09:20,849
lines work with cannabis on the opioid

3976
03:09:18,600 --> 03:09:22,290
epidemic so that's a pretty amazing

3977
03:09:20,850 --> 03:09:27,720

03:09:32,068 --> 03:09:35,519
bad news really good to hear about the

3982
03:09:33,568 --> 03:09:38,969
Gladius Network good to hear about your

3983
03:09:35,520 --> 03:09:40,620
projects in Utah and we're always happy

3984

awesome Colin thank you for coming in

3988
03:09:47,430 --> 03:09:51,870
and dropping some knowledge and getting

3989
03:09:49,770 --> 03:09:53,670
the conversation going and always being

3990
03:09:51,870 --> 03:09:55,319
a part of things and being a bubble

3991
03:09:53,670 --> 03:09:57,898
ambassador out there in the world so

3992
03:09:55,318 --> 03:09:59,579
thank you brother thank you very much

3993
03:09:57,898 --> 03:10:01,079
for the platform and just being a part

3994
03:09:59,579 --> 03:10:04,260
of it and being a good friend man

3995

absolutely mark you definitely were the

3996
03:10:04,260 --> 03:10:07,739
a couple of times today I had to write

3997
03:10:06,180 --> 03:10:17,370
times down I was like oh that's gonna be

3998
03:10:07,739 --> 03:10:23,279
like the 30-second clip of the sharing

3999
03:10:17,370 --> 03:10:25,470
really appreciate your time thank you

4000
03:10:23,279 --> 03:10:29,460
for all your love I mean everything that

4001
03:10:25,469 --> 03:10:31,469
you do to be you I mean you you make you

4002
03:10:29,459 --> 03:10:34,379
make this possible you know and your

4003
03:10:31,469 --> 03:10:36,778
dedication I mean it's like when you got

4004
03:10:34,379 --> 03:10:39,869
hacked we all felt like we all got

4005
03:10:36,779 --> 03:10:42,420
hacked you know I mean so we're we we

4006
03:10:39,870 --> 03:10:44,550
feel you I mean when we miss has Church

4007
03:10:42,420 --> 03:10:47,489
when it's not around and everybody who's

4008
03:10:44,549 --> 03:10:51,179
in chat it's funny because you almost

4009
03:10:47,489 --> 03:10:52,739
wonder what they don't do on Sunday when

4010
03:10:51,180 --> 03:10:56,609

trying and trying they flipping the

4100
03:15:00,639 --> 03:15:04,299
World Health Organization but the

4101
03:15:02,260 --> 03:15:07,090
delayed vote is now happening in

4102
03:15:04,299 --> 03:15:10,000

4103
03:15:07,090 --> 03:15:12,309
and they're putting out now this is the

4104
03:15:10,000 --> 03:15:14,559
next 10 years regarding cannabis so this

4105
03:15:12,309 --> 03:15:16,689
is a book that's out

4106
03:15:14,559 --> 03:15:20,289

4108
03:15:20,290 --> 03:15:24,220

4113

4114
03:15:34,750 --> 03:15:41,350

way for the next decade in cannabis and
