1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:22,019
[Music]

2
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:24,029
how's it going guys we're here late

3
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:27,809
night in Amsterdam after a nice dab

4
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:29,520
session the DNA guys that we just met

5
00:00:27,809 --> 00:00:31,709
I've never actually met either of you

6
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,649
before but you've been around for a

7
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:43,350
couple years in hardened yeah yeah okay

8
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:45,058
cool you won last year I think DNA would

9
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,910
choose no less than the top of the pile

10
00:00:45,058 --> 00:00:50,609
for people to represent them so

11
00:00:46,909 --> 00:00:51,988
excellent Tony had a little thing to

12
00:00:50,609 --> 00:00:52,679
share with us so I thought we'd get this

13
00:00:51,988 --> 00:00:55,619
on film

14
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:57,329
yeah this is the since we're in the

15
00:00:55,619 --> 00:00:59,128
red-light district I figured the red

16
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:03,299
light iron yeah this is the red light or

17
00:00:59,128 --> 00:01:06,959
hot pressing pressing so there's a this

18
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:09,060
is a oil slick so it's like a Teflon

19
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:10,769
paper so this is the new version of what

20
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:13,549
people have been doing for a long many

21
00:01:10,769 --> 00:01:15,689
decades which is the cellophane packet

22
00:01:13,549 --> 00:01:17,728
you know there's different pressing

23
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:19,590
techniques from different countries but

24
00:01:17,728 --> 00:01:21,120
this is the this stuff is pretty

25
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,250
high-tech you can heat this stuff up

26
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:25,439
pretty high up to 500 degrees Wow which

27
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,969
we're never yeah of course not we're

28
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,340
keeping this around 100 and this is

29
00:01:26,969 --> 00:01:31,890
basically a hair straightener this is a

30
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,600
mini hair straightener yeah as a little

31
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:35,280
on button here so hopefully it'll work

32
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:41,069
here because we're in color territory

33
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:42,960
okay so basically the idea here is turn

34
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:44,279
that on so here's your little packet all

35
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:45,719
right we're gonna actually fill it up

36
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,890
we're not fill it up by this is all I

37
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:48,629
have and I just want to press a little

38
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:51,120
piece but I'm gonna put the sweet skunk

39
00:01:48,629 --> 00:01:52,979
dry sift into the packet okay it's

40
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:56,310
heating up quickly so you know very

41
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:59,159
quickly so I just heated up enough to

42
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:02,670
get it warm just so my finger isn't

43
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:04,349
burnt yeah it's really hot it's European

44
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:12,360
heated up laughing well let's go with

45
00:02:04,349 --> 00:02:14,669
that for now just a little pile and so

46
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,920
you use your finger to the gauge how hot

47
00:02:14,669 --> 00:02:19,139
positives and how what is the what is

48
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:21,659
the gauge of based on your so how so

49
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:23,279
pretty warm but not hot pretty warm so

50
00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:25,139
you can hold your thumb there you

51
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,519
definitely not see yes cuz you burned

52
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:28,019
through it cuz if it's hot enough to

53
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:33,060
burn you

54
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:36,830
way too hot anyway yeah so I might take

55
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,830
a little second you ever blew on it

56
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:52,769
still a little hot yes electricity tears

57
00:02:46,539 --> 00:02:52,769
oh wow its weights mission so much dude

58
00:02:56,818 --> 00:03:05,709
close up on this dry sift that's pretty

59
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:08,199
nice right there you don't even have to

60
00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:09,670
use that I can just put it close usually

61
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:11,530
yeah let it out

62
00:03:09,669 --> 00:03:14,589
it looks like and pulled back a little

63
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:18,039
bit of garlic salt tables like sea salt

64
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:21,098
garlic salt some pepper like some kind

65
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:23,620
of old-world spice Pig grind spice type

66
00:03:21,098 --> 00:03:25,509
of thing you don't I mean yeah for

67
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,909
keeping me buried I want to close it

68
00:03:25,509 --> 00:03:29,229
yeah keep close that and then see what

69
00:03:27,909 --> 00:03:31,239
the edges are just kind of fold them up

70
00:03:29,229 --> 00:03:36,659
just not like all the way but just keep

71
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:39,219
them folded I mean this thing is Skookum

72
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:41,430
it's amazing how fast interesting you

73
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:43,780
were turn probably about to burn it out

74
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:45,900
fast that's what it did to the d-mail oh

75
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:51,780
really

76
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:55,239
burned out the whip fast that is forever

77
00:03:51,780 --> 00:04:07,209
it's like I'm still attached that's it

78
00:03:55,239 --> 00:04:08,439
we'll just sure not okay we're good all

79
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:09,549
right so here let me see what you're

80
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:18,488
doing here you just doing a simple

81
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:22,780
little zippity-doo-dah dry sift presses

82
00:04:18,488 --> 00:04:29,259
very nice very hard and hardens very

83
00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:30,939
nice back the other way now because it

84
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:32,889
was bubbling out and I noticed there hey

85
00:04:30,939 --> 00:04:34,629
I like that you got a little dark on the

86
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:36,490
color there yeah that's what you want

87
00:04:34,629 --> 00:04:40,199
right there you know so that's where

88
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:40,199
it's actually pressing in mounting hands

89
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:49,590
it's just enough to get it started

90
00:04:59,788 --> 00:05:03,568
the best way to close up is have it

91
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:05,879
pulled all the way back and then I'll

92
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:07,650
not the camera but the if there's an

93
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:10,588
easy one and then I'll open it up and

94
00:05:07,649 --> 00:05:16,498
show it to that where Tony can open it

95
00:05:10,588 --> 00:05:18,028
up and show it to the camera I didn't

96
00:05:16,499 --> 00:05:23,419
want to overheat it you know what I mean

97
00:05:18,028 --> 00:05:27,509
yeah I'm trying just he's just a gentle

98
00:05:23,418 --> 00:05:30,120
chase it was a lot though yeah more than

99
00:05:27,509 --> 00:05:33,569
you thought hey cuz dry dry heads are

100
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:35,189
dense like very dense wide have to risk

101
00:05:33,569 --> 00:05:37,740
going to the electricity thing one more

102
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:39,960
time but no one's if it open and see

103
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:41,879
what it looks like it needs a little bit

104
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:43,228
more if we do put it in the electricity

105
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:49,129
just put it in for two seconds two

106
00:05:43,228 --> 00:05:49,128
seconds and so it means it's almost

107
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:53,360
working

108
00:05:57,769 --> 00:06:02,120
chew hash you could put this in your

109
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:04,129
shoe and walk around Amsterdam all day

110
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,530
and you'd have the same piece of hash in

111
00:06:04,129 --> 00:06:08,840
your possession what I used to do years

112
00:06:06,529 --> 00:06:10,939
ago was heat up a marble slab in the

113
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:12,978
oven boil some water put it in a wine

114
00:06:10,939 --> 00:06:14,839
bottle and before we went over the

115
00:06:12,978 --> 00:06:16,878
packets with the hot boiling water in

116
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:19,250
the wine bottle these packets were

117
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:19,970
wrapped in newspaper moistened with

118
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:22,009
water

119
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:24,729
made the wet and then put on the stove

120
00:06:22,009 --> 00:06:26,810
on low and it would steam the water

121
00:06:24,728 --> 00:06:29,329
there we go so yeah it needs a little

122
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:34,519
bit more warmth and that'll go all clear

123
00:06:29,329 --> 00:06:38,000
oh the smell though yeah that's sweet

124
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:41,240
sweet skunk smell we can do two seconds

125
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
and get a washer it's better to go less

126
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:45,199
than more the first time yep because

127
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,658
then you're just [ __ ]

128
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:52,639
you don't want to boil it in two seconds

129
00:06:47,658 --> 00:06:55,939
Bob that one one one two three I'll fill

130
00:06:52,639 --> 00:07:01,519
it out no no Robert don't undress it's

131
00:06:55,939 --> 00:07:17,569
better to go laughs wow that was amazing

132
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:23,598
fast ready to blow up in five seconds

133
00:07:17,569 --> 00:07:26,629
yeah the nation oh wow it burns right

134
00:07:23,598 --> 00:07:31,908
through skin in four seconds who's ready

135
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:34,009
to curl their hair that fast a 110 into

136
00:07:31,908 --> 00:07:39,740
a t20 bulb that's the problem it's the

137
00:07:34,009 --> 00:07:42,400
size of my hand yes your electricity so

138
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:42,400
spark plugs

139
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:53,050
okay gentle oh that's warm

140
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:58,689
okay okay that's the one that all good

141
00:07:57,889 --> 00:08:09,379
keep going

142
00:07:58,689 --> 00:08:13,719
nice all the way across I may be nice

143
00:08:09,379 --> 00:08:13,719
thing cleared through this time

144
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:23,009
you could always throw this into like a

145
00:08:19,819 --> 00:08:26,069
freezer mm-hmm and so I was if lock bag

146
00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:29,670
and then inside a freezer yeah to get a

147
00:08:26,069 --> 00:08:31,050
turn really brittle it's dry cept you're

148
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:32,759
gonna be amazed at how brittle it is

149
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:34,590
that's what I was just gonna say when we

150
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:35,939
open this up it's just gonna be crack II

151
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:37,769
shatter yeah

152
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:42,840
don't like when I peel it off it'll

153
00:08:37,769 --> 00:08:45,029
probably even break especially because

154
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:47,670
it's cool in here that nice cool to air

155
00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:50,759
is letting try this is dry sift friendly

156
00:08:47,669 --> 00:08:56,029
temperature probably about eight eight

157
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:56,029
degrees maybe a little degrees you know

158
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:01,919
what we're looking for

159
00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:03,809
all right now peel it off while it's

160
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:16,559
still warm so you can catch it look at

161
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:20,399
it because it will crack like it's the

162
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:21,989
one piece it still fits in is beautiful

163
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:34,139
let's see if we can fit it back in there

164
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:36,360
somehow though it's hard why don't we

165
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:37,590

166
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,940
shattered that's right

167
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:40,290

171
00:09:51,409 --> 00:09:57,299

172
00:09:53,610 --> 00:10:01,409
little smaller God make you h2o shot or

173
