10
00:00:27,289 --> 00:00:31,969
little bit difficult to get a show

11
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:34,009
organized so these last couple of shows

12
00:00:31,969 --> 00:00:36,439

00:01:49,789 --> 00:01:53,629
you in one speaker I've got this shaky

39
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:56,709
computer screen because I'm trying to

40
00:01:53,629 --> 00:02:00,528
plug my headphones in from the front

41
00:01:56,709 --> 00:02:03,109
how are things going by you going well

42
00:02:00,528 --> 00:02:05,748
going well out here you know it's the

43
00:02:03,108 --> 00:02:08,629
the seasons are changing the evenings

44
00:02:05,748 --> 00:02:09,978
are getting cooler you know it's my

45
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:13,340
favorite time of year we're eating

46
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:14,810
tomatoes and melons and you know kind of

47
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:17,409
for me you know what time of year

48
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:19,939
is by what you're eating you know

49
00:02:17,409 --> 00:02:21,949
absolutely I also love the harvest

50
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:24,889
season but I also love it for another

51
00:02:21,949 --> 00:02:27,349
reason that it is the reason that a

52
00:02:24,889 --> 00:02:29,929
variety of psychedelic mushrooms tend to

53
00:02:27,349 --> 00:02:33,049
appear each year here in the Pacific

54
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:35,060
Northwest so gonna be picking stun Z's

55
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:37,580
gonna be picking Semillon sea otters

56
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:41,719
gonna be picking Sian essence gonna be

57
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:44,120
picking as our essence and bail systems

58
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:45,979
so all of those different psychedelic

59
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:48,050
mushrooms will be popping up here in

60
00:02:45,979 --> 00:02:49,519
British Columbia really probably within

61
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:52,700
the next month month and a half

62
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:56,090
depending on the spots and that's always

63
00:02:52,699 --> 00:02:58,939
kind of a nice just a little bonus a

64
00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:01,129
little nature bonus all right I hear ya

65
00:02:58,939 --> 00:03:03,409
yeah we just got through picking all of

66
00:03:01,129 --> 00:03:03,919
our blackberries and everything's coming

67
00:03:03,409 --> 00:03:05,449
in

68
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:08,299
everything's knocking out pretty well

69
00:03:05,449 --> 00:03:10,579
I've got this oh gee that just won't

70
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:13,430
flip but you know probably needs another

71
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:20,269
few days other than that everything's

72
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:24,560
going real well hey buddy what's up how

73
00:03:20,269 --> 00:03:26,209
you doing Mike good it's finally

74
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,180
starting to clear up some of the smoke

75
00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:31,670
out here in Eastern Washington no it's

76
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:33,950
been a been an interesting summer we it

77
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:36,229
was unreasonably beautiful all spring

78
00:03:33,949 --> 00:03:40,518
but you know looking a little bit boxed

79
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:42,379
in Bruce most of the backbone yeah we've

80
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:44,599
been pretty lucky out here like the

81
00:03:42,379 --> 00:03:46,609
portland-vancouver area and the north

82
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:48,680
end of the Willamette Valley here we

83
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:50,600
seem to get up not as much smoke as

84
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:54,049
everybody else we did have a few days

85
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:55,459
but it on the long run after driving up

86
00:03:54,049 --> 00:03:58,459
and down the coast we really had it

87
00:03:55,459 --> 00:04:00,860
pretty easy around here yeah there's

88
00:03:58,459 --> 00:04:02,539
more wind and a traveling up and down

89
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:07,130
the Columbia floor you kind of helps

90
00:04:02,539 --> 00:04:10,489
keep it keep the air clean yeah we get

91
00:04:07,129 --> 00:04:12,229
this we get this nice little breeze

92
00:04:10,489 --> 00:04:14,299
every evening and this little

93
00:04:12,229 --> 00:04:16,430
microclimate that we live off of we get

94
00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:18,410
this Columbia Gorge breeze it starts

95
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:20,989
about one o'clock and goes to 11 o'clock

96
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:23,479
at night and it and it's just you know

97
00:04:20,988 --> 00:04:25,639
really been amazing place to live it's a

98
00:04:23,478 --> 00:04:28,279
little bit cooler here than let's say in

99
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:30,259
Portland or you know further south and

100
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:32,209
and I really appreciate this little

101
00:04:30,259 --> 00:04:33,769
little microclimates and I think that's

102
00:04:32,209 --> 00:04:35,329
one of the things everybody's got to get

103
00:04:33,769 --> 00:04:36,769
used to when they're going out there is

104
00:04:35,329 --> 00:04:38,389
figure out where you're living figure

105
00:04:36,769 --> 00:04:40,579
out the microclimates go talk to the

106
00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:42,800
other regular farmers see what they're

107
00:04:40,579 --> 00:04:46,099
up to and you'll really get a you know a

108
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:49,370
good idea of how things go in your you

109
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:52,490
know little area very true very true

110
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:55,160
welcome both to Mike and to skunkman Sam

111
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:57,439
I'm of course in Vancouver so we got

112
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:59,000
smoked out hard this year like we did

113
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:01,730
last year the last couple years have

114
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,000
kind of been the worst two on record for

115
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:06,590
a while but cliff this locust cleared up

116
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,620
here as well we've got nice clear skies

117
00:05:06,589 --> 00:05:15,009
we don't smell it anymore so a little

118
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:15,009
bit better how you doing Sam

evening for you in Amsterdam that is

122
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:31,819

medicine saying they were gonna pop in a

125
00:05:33,769 --> 00:05:38,569
little bit later on I think Wade said he

126
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:40,850
was gonna be making it in I think Mark

127
00:05:38,569 --> 00:05:42,740
shadown said he was going to be popping

128
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:45,680
in for a bit so we'll have a nice little

129
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:47,389

130
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,620
not sure he says he's real tired but

131
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:52,069
maybe he'll come in and have a

132
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:55,959
conversation with us I see Johnny B's

133
00:05:52,069 --> 00:05:58,879
holding down the chat room in there Oh

134
00:05:55,959 --> 00:06:01,099
Dave P from function Junction what's

135
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:04,490
going on Dave P I was just in function

136
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:06,800
Junction the other day visiting Whistler

137
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:09,079
Medical went on a little tour there of

138
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,970
both the Whistler medical in Whistler

139
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:13,459
and the Whistler medical in Pemberton

140
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:15,410
and I have to say like I was extremely

141
00:06:13,459 --> 00:06:18,049
impressed with the facility that they've

142
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:20,390
built I mean I love Whistler medical in

143
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:22,189
Whistler they're just limited they're in

144
00:06:20,389 --> 00:06:24,459
a smaller space but they've got a really

145
00:06:22,189 --> 00:06:26,810
beautiful building they built in

146
00:06:24,459 --> 00:06:28,759
Pemberton they got a great group of

147
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:31,129
people that are just all about skiing

148
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:33,139
and growing great herb which in my

149
00:06:31,129 --> 00:06:36,139
opinion is a wonderful foundation for

150
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:38,209
owning a licensed facility here in

151
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:41,318
Canada a lot of people their mission is

152
00:06:38,209 --> 00:06:43,688
to just make cash

153
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:46,059
which you know I guess that's a mission

154
00:06:43,689 --> 00:06:49,020
as well but as we all come from this

155
00:06:46,059 --> 00:06:53,289
industry for so long it's nice to have

156
00:06:49,019 --> 00:06:55,088
oh I gotta meet either salmon coming

157
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:56,680
through pretty hard on your microphone

158
00:06:55,088 --> 00:07:01,478
it's just nice to have that foundation

159
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:04,538
of actual you know mission statement of

160
00:07:01,478 --> 00:07:06,158
quality over profits so I was very

161
00:07:04,538 --> 00:07:07,718
impressed with their facility I'm sure

162
00:07:06,158 --> 00:07:09,278
I'll end up doing a tour over there in

163
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:12,129
the next little bit and maybe being able

164
00:07:09,278 --> 00:07:14,050
to do a video of showing the whole flow

165
00:07:12,129 --> 00:07:18,729
but it is beyond impressive when it

166
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:24,908
comes to an indoor grow here in in the

167
00:07:18,728 --> 00:07:26,918
Pacific Northwest I was impressed can

168
00:07:24,908 --> 00:07:29,468
you say more about the 80 acres under

169
00:07:26,918 --> 00:07:31,778
glass not as of yet cosmic lettuce was

170
00:07:29,468 --> 00:07:33,490
at but as that comes to fruition I will

171
00:07:31,778 --> 00:07:34,808
absolutely sometimes it's a little bit

172
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:37,478
early that was something I mentioned

173
00:07:34,809 --> 00:07:39,610
earlier in chat room today I am gonna be

174
00:07:37,478 --> 00:07:42,818
going and touring 80 acres under glass

175
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:45,129
this week upcoming week

176
00:07:42,819 --> 00:07:47,740
and maybe I will do some video it's not

177
00:07:45,129 --> 00:07:50,468
cannabis right now they're growing some

178
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:51,879
vegetables but they're looking at

179
00:07:50,468 --> 00:07:55,449
getting into the cannabis marketplace

180
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:58,209
and what better opportunity when you

181
00:07:55,449 --> 00:08:02,620
have close to a hundred acres of

182
00:07:58,209 --> 00:08:05,439
greenhouses to do such a thing and so

183
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:06,218
how was your uh your experience after

184
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:10,439
you left

185
00:08:06,218 --> 00:08:10,439
Vancouver Mike did you have a good week

186
00:08:12,389 --> 00:08:17,619
yeah it's been a pretty interesting week

187
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:20,468
I mean my micro is giving me issues as I

188
00:08:17,619 --> 00:08:23,379
mentioned so my truck's been in the shop

189
00:08:20,468 --> 00:08:25,418
for the week but it's been a good weeks

190
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:27,309
we came back ended up coming back and

191
00:08:25,418 --> 00:08:29,408
had a couple meetings out here with a

192
00:08:27,309 --> 00:08:32,370
beverage company here in east side of

193
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:36,929
the state looking at doing some

194
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:45,419
investments with them so that's alright

195
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:48,149
yeah I guess good gotta get some stuff

196
00:08:45,419 --> 00:08:52,229
maintaining the vehicle is required oh

197
00:08:48,149 --> 00:08:55,289
yeah I know well that facility though

198
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:58,959
definitely a nice facility

199
00:08:55,289 --> 00:09:01,059
it's bigger than most of the licensed

200
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:04,328
crews in Washington state's largest

201
00:09:01,059 --> 00:09:08,649
grows in Washington are 30,000 square

202
00:09:04,328 --> 00:09:10,989
feet canopies which you can you can have

203
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:13,208
up to three of them on a parcel but you

204
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:15,610
know when you're looking at doing a you

205
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:17,799
know large scale temp labs you want to

206
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:20,649
be able to source from multiple acres

207
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:22,719
so when same things true in preparation

208
00:09:20,649 --> 00:09:24,429
or candidates in Canada you know now

209
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:28,209
that now that Canada is going full

210
00:09:24,429 --> 00:09:30,549
federal recreational you're going to be

211
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:33,849
able to start seeing shifts from you

212
00:09:30,549 --> 00:09:37,389
know people growing small less than one

213
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:41,259
acre parcels of cannabis with 5200

214
00:09:37,389 --> 00:09:44,139
strains on them to having an acre plus

215
00:09:41,259 --> 00:09:46,180
of each strain and that really opens up

216
00:09:44,139 --> 00:09:52,720
the door on you know how you can process

217
00:09:46,179 --> 00:09:57,879
cannabis and how it can you can vastly

218
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:59,800
increase its availability to well that's

219
00:09:57,879 --> 00:10:02,230
kind of one of the purposes of embark is

220
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:04,599
to build this large-scale extraction lab

221
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:06,789
that does the quiver all the different

222
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:09,129
levels of extraction that we can do

223
00:10:06,789 --> 00:10:10,958
legally here in Canada and then be able

224
00:10:09,129 --> 00:10:13,389
to offer to our customers to be able to

225
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:15,399
come in with a small sample of 10 or 20

226
00:10:13,389 --> 00:10:18,370
kilos run it through all the different

227
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:20,078
processes show them where their strong

228
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:21,669
points are where their weak points are

229
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:23,909
and allow them to pick and choose the

230
00:10:21,669 --> 00:10:27,490
type of extractions that they want to do

231
00:10:23,909 --> 00:10:29,708
building up to eventually growing the

232
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:31,720
cannabis specifically for the type of

233
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:33,489
extractions they want to do so that's

234
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:36,639
something that we're very excited about

235
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:38,589
and definitely you know a company like

236
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:40,870
Sega for tissue culture is gonna be a

237
00:10:38,589 --> 00:10:42,160
big part of that having the lab is going

238
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:45,188
to be a big part of that and then of

239
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:46,809
course the growers that's the magical

240
00:10:45,188 --> 00:10:49,269
Trinity right there where the growers

241
00:10:46,809 --> 00:10:52,419
are getting their cultivars cleaned you

242
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:55,328
know free of microbial pathogen and

243
00:10:52,419 --> 00:11:00,219
fungi and then being able to you know

244
00:10:55,328 --> 00:11:01,659
acquire that for the lab so you know we

245
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:04,350
have a little bit of an advantage in the

246
00:11:01,659 --> 00:11:06,759
sense that we don't have to deal with

247
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:08,528
contaminants you could imagine in a big

248
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:10,419
in a large-scale facility like

249
00:11:08,528 --> 00:11:12,639
could become a problem for quarantine

250
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:19,179
and could be a problem for cross

251
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:20,980
contamination of the machinery Oh Kevin

252
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:22,899
Monaco says why not just kill him why

253
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:25,420
pass around shitty clones well just keep

254
00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:27,159
in mind like 90% of people are passing

255
00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:29,919
around shitty clones and just because

256
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:32,620
your clones don't show powdery mildew or

257
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:34,419
they don't show like bugs or or botrytis

258
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:37,328
or specific things that are quite

259
00:11:34,419 --> 00:11:39,639
visible there are all sorts of things

260
00:11:37,328 --> 00:11:42,758
they can that can impregnate your clones

261
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:44,948
that can just slow it down that can

262
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:46,360
affect the expression of the terpene and

263
00:11:44,948 --> 00:11:49,479
the cannabinoids that won't necessarily

264
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:51,550
show you you know splotches on the

265
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:54,909
leaves or powdery mildew growing in the

266
00:11:51,549 --> 00:11:56,889
buds but will affect the outcome of your

267
00:11:54,909 --> 00:11:59,649
of your crop and when you're growing you

268
00:11:56,889 --> 00:12:02,169
know 80 acres or 10 acres or whatever

269
00:11:59,649 --> 00:12:04,539
that's that's a lot of cannabis and you

270
00:12:02,169 --> 00:12:06,458
you want it to be able to really have

271
00:12:04,539 --> 00:12:08,498
the renewed vigour of a tissue culture

272
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:10,508
plant you want it to be clean fresh and

273
00:12:08,499 --> 00:12:12,100
you want it to express itself to the to

274
00:12:10,509 --> 00:12:15,430
the maximum of its potential of its

275
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:18,009
genetic potential so and the best way to

276
00:12:15,429 --> 00:12:19,058
take the cultivators are standing out

277
00:12:18,009 --> 00:12:20,980
dirty clones

278
00:12:19,058 --> 00:12:24,219
that's we'd put them out of business is

279
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:27,360
by giving consumers a better option you

280
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:33,370
can give consumers a genetically pure

281
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:36,100
clone that can have any fat taken taken

282
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:42,818
through tissue so it had its genetic

283
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:53,528
bigger restored and being very rapidly

284
00:12:42,818 --> 00:12:55,539
able to hand out at this point in time

285
00:12:53,528 --> 00:12:58,389
on there's a warden Astaire ward in

286
00:12:55,539 --> 00:13:02,620
circle fading in that war this is

287
00:12:58,389 --> 00:13:05,850
probably going well there's there's tons

288
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:09,459
of different microclimates that you I'm

289
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:12,129
smoking on some gold right now but

290
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:13,838
growing equatorial zebras in Washington

291
00:13:12,129 --> 00:13:16,899
state probably isn't the best thing to

292
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:20,189
do is trying to go green outdoors but if

293
00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:22,570
you can have that are adapted to

294
00:13:20,188 --> 00:13:25,269
whatever state or what

295
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:27,730
return while you're in and then you that

296
00:13:25,269 --> 00:13:31,029
really open the star doors for the part

297
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:32,830
to be able to yeah best express the

298
00:13:31,029 --> 00:13:35,949
phenotypes themselves without having to

299
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:41,259
worry about those basic things like we

300
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:44,770
genetics for potential and passage or

301
00:13:41,259 --> 00:13:46,689
even pretend from sits on Tennessee

302
00:13:44,769 --> 00:13:50,470
breeders out that are yeah been

303
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:53,890
accounted time breeding out in unstable

304
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:55,420
genetics we want to hang out and provide

305
00:13:53,889 --> 00:13:59,230
genetic to the consumers who the

306
00:13:55,419 --> 00:14:06,819
producers that are able enough in the K

307
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:09,460
dot it on yeah just try to stand a

308
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:10,870
little closer to it oh sorry just trying

309
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:12,730
to try to get a little closer to your

310
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:15,940
mic there Mike you were cutting out a

311
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:17,710
tiny little bit but yeah you know these

312
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:19,660
tissue culture companies is well part of

313
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:21,730
what they really you know the most

314
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:23,259
important factor is their microbiology

315
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:24,879
lab being able to fingerprint the

316
00:14:23,259 --> 00:14:26,200
genetic and let you know that the

317
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:28,419
planets that you're buying is an

318
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:30,580
accurate description an accurate genetic

319
00:14:28,419 --> 00:14:32,500
match of the plant you believe you're

320
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:33,759
buying and then of course you know with

321
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,620
the certification through the

322
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:37,950
microbiology lab that there's not going

323
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:48,340
to be these certain pathogens and

324
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:50,170
vectors for for problem everyone's quiet

325
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:52,320
now all right well I'll just keep

326
00:14:50,169 --> 00:14:57,219
talking maybe we'll load up a bowl here

327
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:58,870
little uh a little vape exhale I invited

328
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:02,680
Sabo today I'm not sure if he's gonna be

329
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:06,730
able to make it but hey Marcus hey how

330
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:11,379
are you doing there dr. mark good fish

331
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:13,120
yes Denver Colorado oh [ __ ] I saw that

332
00:15:11,379 --> 00:15:15,039
you were on fish tour man you're living

333
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:18,190
out my dreams with all these fish shows

334
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:22,719
it's been so long since I've been to a

335
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:26,230
fish yes right yeah fish need of a man

336
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:29,680
back dude I want to be back at the shows

337
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:32,440
for rather country Kuroda's light rig is

338
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:35,739
just unbelievable like moves up and down

339
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:36,430
during the show it's just really really

340
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:40,629
incredible

341
00:15:36,429 --> 00:15:43,719
I am out here to promote this company

342
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:46,629
1906 which has collaborated with fish

343
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:49,000
lyricist Tom Marshall to come up with

344
00:15:46,629 --> 00:15:51,629
two different medicated chocolate

345
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:55,200
products ones called bliss which is a

346
00:15:51,629 --> 00:15:57,759
like a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup sort of

347
00:15:55,200 --> 00:16:01,028
situation and the other is called go

348
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:03,669
which is a expresso bean and so this is

349
00:16:01,028 --> 00:16:05,679
a Tom Marshall signature you'd see Tom

350
00:16:03,669 --> 00:16:09,179
Marshall is the litters as primary

351
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:12,129
lyricist efficient tray and stasia's

352
00:16:09,179 --> 00:16:16,049
songwriting partner that's amazing I

353
00:16:12,129 --> 00:16:16,049
really or maybe we heard they were

354
00:16:16,169 --> 00:16:20,349
that's awesome

355
00:16:17,889 --> 00:16:22,809
I had no I mean I heard rumors that they

356
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:25,450
were gonna be dude well being in so it's

357
00:16:22,809 --> 00:16:29,278
it's really nice to see that's that's

358
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:29,278
really awesome welcome Cuban by the way

359
00:16:30,028 --> 00:16:36,879
I could help but not click and join in

360
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:39,250
you know so set up and stuff wash my

361
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:45,039
face off a little bit even though you're

362
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:47,019
exhausted it's almost like I like a

363
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:48,939
[ __ ] psychedelic exhaustion level

364
00:16:47,019 --> 00:16:50,679
where sometimes I think I hear and see

365
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:55,060
things but it's really that probably

366
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:57,629
haven't slept eight hours in days yeah

367
00:16:55,059 --> 00:17:00,609
well like I said I was what's that mark

368
00:16:57,629 --> 00:17:05,470
hash exhaustion like tennis elbow you

369
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:09,250
know it's just a you know catch the dogs

370
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:12,130
the work you know yeah a casualty of the

371
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:14,439
industry or what you do you know oh no

372
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:17,079
I'm not tired because of the hash I

373
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:19,089
actually haven't made much hash this

374
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:24,369
year bro like I think that in all of

375
00:17:19,088 --> 00:17:27,938
2018 I probably didn't do maybe not even

376
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:31,449
a week's worth of what I did in 2015 so

377
00:17:27,939 --> 00:17:35,470
it's not hash but I am raising puppies I

378
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:37,660
have a litter of 14 day old pups they

379
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:39,759
need they need to get fed every two to

380
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:41,558
three hours and at first they're kind of

381
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:43,808
quiet you know you can set a bed next to

382
00:17:41,558 --> 00:17:45,700
the whelping box and it's cool but when

383
00:17:43,808 --> 00:17:47,289
they start making noise and they're

384
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:49,680
sleeping all day but crying all night

385
00:17:47,289 --> 00:17:51,930
dude it's [ __ ] rough

386
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:53,820
I feel you on that hash thing you know I

387
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:55,860
haven't been making as much myself I'm

388
00:17:53,819 --> 00:17:57,990
ready to gear up but going to Whistler a

389
00:17:55,859 --> 00:18:00,990
couple of weeks ago we just we worked

390
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:05,160
for about four hours and we made almost

391
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:08,009
two kilos of dried bubble love this sort

392
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:10,620
of industrial scaling up of hashing and

393
00:18:08,009 --> 00:18:13,379
not pulling these like 10 and 20 20 gram

394
00:18:10,619 --> 00:18:15,779
bags but pulling these like multi ounce

395
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:18,780
screens that you know add up to many

396
00:18:15,779 --> 00:18:20,759
many kilos after after a short period of

397
00:18:18,779 --> 00:18:23,430
time and that was just out of the 250

398
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:25,200
litre machine we didn't even use the

399
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:28,380
thousand liter machine so you can

400
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:30,930
imagine once we start dumping 40 or 50

401
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:33,360
dry kilos into one of those large-scale

402
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:37,830
units that we'll be able to make maybe

403
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:40,469
five kilos in a shot or whatnot maybe a

404
00:18:37,829 --> 00:18:42,899
little more so as soon as you posted the

405
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:45,029
video of the washer a couple weeks ago

406
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:47,250
people started hitting me up like yo

407
00:18:45,029 --> 00:18:49,649
check out this badass machine bubbleman

408
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:52,130
is using and it's pretty badass indeed

409
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:55,050
but I noticed that it stirs from the top

410
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:57,510
absolutely a washer spin from the bottom

411
00:18:55,049 --> 00:18:59,009
without any correct material how do you

412
00:18:57,509 --> 00:19:01,740
know about that because I'm a big

413
00:18:59,009 --> 00:19:03,750
believer on the chamber spinning yeah I

414
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:05,640
love the chamber spinning and that's why

415
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:07,289
we really designed the large-scale unit

416
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:09,750
the thing that we didn't really share is

417
00:19:07,289 --> 00:19:11,519
the is the spinner the linear actuator

418
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:13,740
and what it actually looks like and how

419
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:16,289
much time and energy it took to design

420
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:18,240
that to actually spin the material so

421
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:20,369
all of the material gets spin rather

422
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,259
than just some simple thing that spins

423
00:19:20,369 --> 00:19:27,409
and the material doesn't get touched so

424
00:19:22,259 --> 00:19:29,910
the problem in a GE EU GMP certified

425
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:32,670
facility like it is federally here in

426
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:35,009
Canada microbials are a big problem and

427
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:37,110
when you spin from the bottom you are

428
00:19:35,009 --> 00:19:39,089
going to have some serious problems with

429
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:41,909
bacteria unless you can take that

430
00:19:39,089 --> 00:19:43,889
machine apart every single time and

431
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:45,240
that's the real problem I love spinning

432
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:47,040
from the bottom Kuban and we're not

433
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,809
stopping we're trying to figure it out

434
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:50,309
but I can tell you that the people that

435
00:19:48,809 --> 00:19:52,769
have figured it out like if you take

436
00:19:50,309 --> 00:19:54,869
those machines apart and you look in the

437
00:19:52,769 --> 00:19:56,369
bottom there's going to be things that

438
00:19:54,869 --> 00:19:58,919
get captured you have to take the

439
00:19:56,369 --> 00:20:01,979
Machine apart every single time you mix

440
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:03,840
and it really becomes a problem for for

441
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:06,269
workflow maybe if you had

442
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:08,399
many units and you were able to run you

443
00:20:06,269 --> 00:20:09,720
know fresh batches in each reactor

444
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,690
throughout your day and at the end of

445
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:15,140
the day you you you steeps you steam

446
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:18,179
clean or autoclave all of these

447
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:20,278
stainless steel chambers but the real

448
00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:23,038
problem is having that thing spinning at

449
00:20:20,278 --> 00:20:25,440
the bottom and having water and hash get

450
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:27,298
into the that area and stay and not

451
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,009
clean out properly then you're then

452
00:20:27,298 --> 00:20:31,980
you're looking at a microbial nightmare

453
00:20:29,009 --> 00:20:33,869
and for Health Canada they just won't

454
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:35,669
pass it it won't be able to be sold so

455
00:20:33,869 --> 00:20:37,918
this is one of our problems I'm a

456
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:39,929
hundred percent on point with you I love

457
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:43,020
the spinning from the bottom at the same

458
00:20:39,929 --> 00:20:45,298
time we're getting 17 to 20 percent

459
00:20:43,019 --> 00:20:47,548
yields out of the water hash that we're

460
00:20:45,298 --> 00:20:50,158
running up in Whistler not always

461
00:20:47,548 --> 00:20:51,569
sometimes it's as low as 12% but what

462
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,490
these guys have done with their data

463
00:20:51,569 --> 00:20:56,220
points and the mixing you know they'll

464
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:57,750
mix for you know an hour plus but

465
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:59,730
they'll stop it at five minutes 10

466
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:01,679
minutes 15 minutes and they there's a

467
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:03,630
graph that's been created for each

468
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,880
different cultivar where you can see

469
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:07,409
where it actually starts starts really

470
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,940
clearing out the material and this has

471
00:21:07,409 --> 00:21:10,649
been a problem with bubble hash for a

472
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:12,750
long time it's easy to get the good

473
00:21:10,648 --> 00:21:14,969
stuff off and that's all I ever really

474
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:16,500
promoted but there's an enormous amount

475
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:18,480
of stuff that's left over that can be

476
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:20,609
used in plant fat extractions that can

477
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:23,429
be used in all sorts of different other

478
00:21:20,609 --> 00:21:24,990
sort of products and it was getting left

479
00:21:23,429 --> 00:21:26,759
behind and people were always just like

480
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:27,990
okay I'm getting 10 or 12 percent and

481
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:30,450
they were quite happy with it but

482
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:34,230
getting upwards of 17 20 percent and

483
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:36,028
even 25 percent return on bubble hash is

484
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:38,308
something that we are actually pretty

485
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:41,460
stoked about so when we sell these

486
00:21:38,308 --> 00:21:44,220
machines all of that data is coming with

487
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:46,019
it so it comes along with the IP of the

488
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:48,538
different cultivars the graphs for each

489
00:21:46,019 --> 00:21:51,509
cultivar are the mixing times and the

490
00:21:48,538 --> 00:21:55,798
shape and size of the blade that goes in

491
00:21:51,509 --> 00:21:58,950
to spin so 100% on point and very very

492
00:21:55,798 --> 00:22:00,960
very good question yeah and I'm on board

493
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:03,390
with you on the other sterilizing the

494
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:06,899
washers or the vessels every run I mean

495
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:08,490
it's very important any or plant matter

496
00:22:06,898 --> 00:22:10,979
or what they call here it's funny in

497
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:13,589
California they call material biomass

498
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:16,740
it's crazy term but as long as you have

499
00:22:13,589 --> 00:22:17,099
biomass water and you leave it in a

500
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:21,179
chain

501
00:22:17,099 --> 00:22:24,000
even a small particle can contaminate

502
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:27,090
the hash you know if days after if it

503
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,640
runs through so we modify the washers

504
00:22:27,089 --> 00:22:31,798
heavily you know when I was a washing I

505
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:35,400
still used the washers that you sold

506
00:22:31,798 --> 00:22:37,529
years ago but on

507
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:39,090
I definitely feel you on those designs

508
00:22:37,529 --> 00:22:41,490
but you can still fabricate something

509
00:22:39,089 --> 00:22:44,220
with that like minimalistic concept in

510
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:45,690
mind with easily removable parts not a

511
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:48,600
lot of little nooks and crannies to

512
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:49,950
clean in between runs right I mean not

513
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:51,658
as easy as you would think we're

514
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:52,950
definitely trying and working on it I

515
00:22:51,659 --> 00:22:55,409
was just looking at the Delta

516
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:56,880
separations units up on the Sunshine

517
00:22:55,409 --> 00:22:58,500
Coast the other day my buddy's got one

518
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,480
of those and it mixes from the bottom

519
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:02,250
but it only really runs a couple you

520
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:05,279
know two to six pounds at a time maybe

521
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:08,069
eight pounds and I'm sure we're looking

522
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:09,269
at 40 and 50 kilo runs and maybe even

523
00:23:08,069 --> 00:23:11,250
eventually getting it bigger than that

524
00:23:09,269 --> 00:23:12,779
so we want to you know the lab that I'm

525
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:14,069
that I'm building and Mike's going to be

526
00:23:12,779 --> 00:23:16,950
a big part of this we want to bring him

527
00:23:14,069 --> 00:23:18,779
on for the co2 extraction and to help

528
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:22,380
with other parts of the ice live and

529
00:23:18,779 --> 00:23:24,269
whatnot we're really looking to make

530
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:26,549
sure that this that the traditional hash

531
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:29,429
rooms and I say traditional in the sense

532
00:23:26,548 --> 00:23:31,710
of water extraction dry sifting in rosin

533
00:23:29,429 --> 00:23:36,059
versus the solvent extractions like cryo

534
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:37,710
ethanol versus the co2 extraction I want

535
00:23:36,058 --> 00:23:40,470
to make sure that the hash has a

536
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:42,029
footprint that is at least substantial

537
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:44,009
compared to the oil that we're going to

538
00:23:42,029 --> 00:23:46,470
be producing because the you know the

539
00:23:44,009 --> 00:23:48,029
cryo ethanol that were that we're going

540
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:51,000
to be doing has the capabilities of

541
00:23:48,029 --> 00:23:54,000
processing almost 10,000 pounds per day

542
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,730
of plant matter and so to be able to do

543
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,609
that much you know even at 50 kilos

544
00:23:56,730 --> 00:24:01,470
every two hours in the thousand liter

545
00:23:59,609 --> 00:24:05,459
reactor and we get four of those

546
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:08,130
reactors you know that kilos of water

547
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:11,150
hash run every two hours we could

548
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:13,620
probably do about a thousand kilos a day

549
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:16,159
through the water hash extractors it's

550
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:18,449
still you know only ten percent of

551
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:20,220
what's going to be produced in the oil

552
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:22,140
so of course me being a solvent list guy

553
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:24,990
I love the idea of getting that up as

554
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:27,179
high as we can and anytime you scale

555
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:28,919
anything up generally there are these

556
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:30,840
arcs that happen these sort of

557
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:33,150
exponential arcs that

558
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:34,529
occur and it just becomes a little bit

559
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:36,570
more difficult you never really realize

560
00:24:34,529 --> 00:24:39,629
like with water hash it's the thrashing

561
00:24:36,569 --> 00:24:42,539
ratios the threshing ratios that you get

562
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:44,340
where you how much threshing versus how

563
00:24:42,539 --> 00:24:46,470
much water versus how much ice versus

564
00:24:44,339 --> 00:24:48,839
how much plant matter is in there it

565
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:51,839
changes as the reactor gets bigger and

566
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:53,730
bigger and you really have to accord to

567
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:55,559
that but I'm definitely on point with

568
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:59,130
you in the sense that I love the idea of

569
00:24:55,559 --> 00:25:00,509
a bottom you know chamber and we thought

570
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:02,670
of a few different ideas we've got

571
00:25:00,509 --> 00:25:05,910
engineers on this we've moved this well

572
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:08,519
beyond hash makers we've hired engineers

573
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:09,900
who are very much engineers than

574
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:11,639
mechanical engineers this is what they

575
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:13,230
think about and it's all about putting

576
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:15,750
those two groups of people together and

577
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:17,460
whistler technologies is really sort of

578
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:21,269
pushing the forefront on this right now

579
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:24,660
with hiring engineers to sit with hash

580
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:26,549
makers and to work together to overcome

581
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:28,080
these obstacles because an engineer will

582
00:25:26,549 --> 00:25:29,909
come up with all these ideas based on

583
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:32,369
not really understanding the subtle

584
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:34,080
nuances of the resin gland and the

585
00:25:32,369 --> 00:25:35,879
breaking of the resin gland and how it

586
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:37,829
sinks in the water and so the hash

587
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:40,380
makers really tuned into these things

588
00:25:37,829 --> 00:25:41,819
collecting the hash workflow whereas the

589
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:43,500
engineers just trying to solve problems

590
00:25:41,819 --> 00:25:45,539
so when you put those two people

591
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:48,420
together I think there's going to be

592
00:25:45,539 --> 00:25:51,180
some real real breakthroughs in the in

593
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:54,320
the upcoming year or years with water

594
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:56,430
extraction as well as dry sifting oh

595
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:59,609
yeah that's awesome

596
00:25:56,430 --> 00:26:01,170
and I mean you you have to I personally

597
00:25:59,609 --> 00:26:03,750
don't have the balls to run that much

598
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:06,269
material at one time bro that's like my

599
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:08,640
biggest fear like [ __ ] something up

600
00:26:06,269 --> 00:26:10,289
like that so I always do like washers

601
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,759
have you ever had like a washer drain or

602
00:26:10,289 --> 00:26:14,609
just [ __ ] up you're like man thank God

603
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:17,339
it's just a pound straight up dude the

604
00:26:14,609 --> 00:26:18,689
scalability thing is terrifying but I

605
00:26:17,339 --> 00:26:22,379
read a really good quote from someone

606
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:25,410
recently it was if your dreams aren't

607
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:27,330
terrifying you if your dreams aren't

608
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:30,750
making you terrified then you need to

609
00:26:27,329 --> 00:26:32,490
you know dream bigger and I really that

610
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:34,589
really resonated with me you know I was

611
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:36,720
like okay I guess I'm on point cuz I'm

612
00:26:34,589 --> 00:26:38,789
like you know one minute I'm like this

613
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,980
is amazing this is gonna be awesome and

614
00:26:38,789 --> 00:26:43,149
then the next minute I'm half

615
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:45,829
idiot act like holy [ __ ] like this is uh

616
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:48,440
this is this is this could be too much

617
00:26:45,829 --> 00:26:51,109
this could be eres you know and like you

618
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:54,950
said a pound as a pound but 50 kilos is

619
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:57,889
50 kilos hey welcome to Wade laughter

620
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:59,798
and 2d 420 Kane just showed up into the

621
00:26:57,890 --> 00:27:06,860
room welcome guys

622
00:26:59,798 --> 00:27:09,319
so you have just to get this question

623
00:27:06,859 --> 00:27:11,298
out real quick before I yes I have a bad

624
00:27:09,319 --> 00:27:14,178
memory brush smoke too much and I forget

625
00:27:11,298 --> 00:27:16,910
[ __ ] no do it ash Church bro I take so

626
00:27:14,179 --> 00:27:19,580
many dabs by by the end of the church

627
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:22,130
dude I'm like blast well you need to get

628
00:27:19,579 --> 00:27:24,289
some alpha pining dominant terpene

629
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:25,970
cultivars and push those mercy and

630
00:27:24,289 --> 00:27:28,399
cultivars to the side for a bit because

631
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:31,610
you'll you'll get that focus back you'll

632
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:32,690
get that you know real focus back but go

633
00:27:31,609 --> 00:27:35,629
ahead ask your question

634
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:37,340
so how are you draining these 50 kilos

635
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:38,870
out of time definitely not through no

636
00:27:37,339 --> 00:27:41,990
twenty gal bubble bags so that means you

637
00:27:38,869 --> 00:27:43,428
must be designing some heat oh yeah dude

638
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:52,630
you didn't see you didn't see those

639
00:27:43,429 --> 00:27:52,630
screens no I loved that's crazy

640
00:27:53,048 --> 00:27:59,599
are they steel stainless steel yeah did

641
00:27:56,529 --> 00:28:01,490
man so you know engineers dude like you

642
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:02,779
said they're good at solutions and when

643
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:04,339
they bring [ __ ] like that I'm like nah

644
00:28:02,779 --> 00:28:06,289
man don't reinvent the wheel

645
00:28:04,339 --> 00:28:07,909
they'll bag with the meshes to shape but

646
00:28:06,289 --> 00:28:09,589
now that I see you're with the mesh well

647
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:11,779
you see the bottom here too it's not a

648
00:28:09,589 --> 00:28:14,418
very good but at the bottom right here

649
00:28:11,779 --> 00:28:16,369
yeah that's about sixty thousand US

650
00:28:14,419 --> 00:28:18,259
dollars and what it does is it vibrates

651
00:28:16,369 --> 00:28:20,839
and you can set it to vibrate so it's

652
00:28:18,259 --> 00:28:22,460
offset or onset you can there's all

653
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:24,589
these different settings that you can do

654
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:26,509
in the stainless steel screens you can

655
00:28:24,589 --> 00:28:27,918
vibrate them so the patterns travel in

656
00:28:26,509 --> 00:28:29,720
one direction travel in the other

657
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:32,320
direction go towards the center go

658
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:34,519
towards the outward area it is

659
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:36,349
unbelievable to watch man I'm telling

660
00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:40,029
you you would be like a kid in a [ __ ]

661
00:28:36,349 --> 00:28:42,859
candy store watching this thing operate

662
00:28:40,029 --> 00:28:45,200
it's the UH but it's no joke they're

663
00:28:42,859 --> 00:28:47,058
definitely they're definitely costly

664
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,580
units they're from the mining industry

665
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:52,700
and the amount of control that you have

666
00:28:49,579 --> 00:28:55,129
over them it's the first time I saw it

667
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:58,160
I was just like yes this is absolutely

668
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:59,840
on point and I was super glad that you

669
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:02,860
know give a shout-out to Daniel and

670
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:05,389
Kelvin and all the crew over at Whistler

671
00:29:02,859 --> 00:29:07,969
technologies I'm super stoked to join

672
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:11,030
that team and just move water extraction

673
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:14,059
dry sifting into this I guess industrial

674
00:29:11,029 --> 00:29:15,769
scale that is so needed without the

675
00:29:14,059 --> 00:29:17,750
worry which everyone's always got the

676
00:29:15,769 --> 00:29:20,240
worry and Kuban just sort of pointed it

677
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:22,430
out it's not it's not just you know

678
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:24,950
mucking up the pound it's losing the

679
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:26,299
quality so it's a very interesting thing

680
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:28,370
what we're trying to do is create

681
00:29:26,299 --> 00:29:30,950
something that can not sacrifice the

682
00:29:28,369 --> 00:29:33,979
quality but acquire the quality in that

683
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:36,680
first pass and then still acquire the

684
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:39,140
rest of the of the actual resin without

685
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:40,910
just doing plant fat extractions or

686
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:43,250
solvent extractions we want to really be

687
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:45,200
able to get as much of that hash off in

688
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:47,839
the traditional ways which is micro

689
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,759
encapsulated resin glands you know maybe

690
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:51,559
there's not maybe a lot of people don't

691
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:53,450
think it's different but cannabinoids

692
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:56,450
that have been melted off with heats or

693
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:58,279
solvents are just different from the

694
00:29:56,450 --> 00:30:00,170
micro encapsulated resins and it's why

695
00:29:58,279 --> 00:30:01,129
some people prefer hash and some people

696
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:04,340
prefer oil

697
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:06,050
I love having in both of them in my

698
00:30:04,339 --> 00:30:08,149
quiver you can imagine for many many

699
00:30:06,049 --> 00:30:10,309
years I smoked only hash I would not

700
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:12,830
smoke solvent extracted hash and that's

701
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:14,990
oil and that's all there really was

702
00:30:12,829 --> 00:30:16,699
and so when rosin came out that was huge

703
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:18,769
for me because suddenly now I was able

704
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:20,509
to play around with oil when you know

705
00:30:18,769 --> 00:30:25,069
ask someone like Dee who's known me for

706
00:30:20,509 --> 00:30:27,289
a long time did I ever smoked oil the

707
00:30:25,069 --> 00:30:30,649
answer's [ __ ] no I think he's frozen up

708
00:30:27,289 --> 00:30:33,379
but actually I tried to have yourself

709
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:35,300
long traveled we first met and you were

710
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:37,250
very polite and said thank you very much

711
00:30:35,299 --> 00:30:47,990
I'll give this to some of my employees

712
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:51,319
and they might like yeah and you saw

713
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:53,539
what I got you know yeah that changed

714
00:30:51,319 --> 00:30:55,369
changed my world changed it very fair

715
00:30:53,539 --> 00:30:58,549
and then definitely changed your

716
00:30:55,369 --> 00:31:01,879
direction at least yeah I remember the I

717
00:30:58,549 --> 00:31:04,009
was at the the volcano you brought out a

718
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:06,210
little bit of real shitty this is my

719
00:31:04,009 --> 00:31:08,940
always all go to to sell these I don't

720
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:11,009
or to was come in the back and I'll take

721
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:13,259
some we felt that I've had for about two

722
00:31:11,009 --> 00:31:15,299
years and I'll put it in the little

723
00:31:13,259 --> 00:31:16,920
thing there and we'll vape it and tell

724
00:31:15,299 --> 00:31:20,250
me how you like it and it tastes like

725
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:21,690
[ __ ] killer hash every time I'd sell

726
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:23,039
them every time just like that just

727
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:25,289
because of that and that's what you did

728
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:27,599
to me let's just put a little of this in

729
00:31:25,289 --> 00:31:29,430
there and try that out you know people

730
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:32,119
always kind of laugh about older

731
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:35,370
material a big problem in the Canadian

732
00:31:32,119 --> 00:31:37,199
situation LP situations sometimes before

733
00:31:35,369 --> 00:31:38,339
they get their license though well I was

734
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,779
talking to a guy yesterday he's got

735
00:31:38,339 --> 00:31:41,369
three hundred thousand grams in this

736
00:31:39,779 --> 00:31:43,529
vault he hasn't sold a gram yet they

737
00:31:41,369 --> 00:31:45,209
just got their license to sell yesterday

738
00:31:43,529 --> 00:31:48,089
and people are always like ah you know

739
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:50,539
who wants to smoke year old resin like

740
00:31:48,089 --> 00:31:53,549
that's that's bunk and I can assure you

741
00:31:50,539 --> 00:31:56,309
that it is not bunk especially from the

742
00:31:53,549 --> 00:31:58,710
hash makers perspective cured resin

743
00:31:56,309 --> 00:32:01,529
makes wonderful wonderful hash I have

744
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:04,400
some here some rosin that I made this is

745
00:32:01,529 --> 00:32:08,099
some harmony this was on but I grew in

746
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:09,810
2012 so the bud was six years old and I

747
00:32:08,099 --> 00:32:12,480
pulled it out of my freezer when I put

748
00:32:09,809 --> 00:32:14,669
this under people's noses every single

749
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:16,230
time it's the same thing the eyebrows go

750
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:17,580
up and the Wow

751
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:19,710
comes out of their mouth and it's not

752
00:32:17,579 --> 00:32:21,269
because I'm some amazing grower it's

753
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:23,250
really more that the cultivar was

754
00:32:21,269 --> 00:32:25,109
special I got it from reefer man it's

755
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:27,690
the Harmony it has an absolute [ __ ]

756
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:30,689
beautiful nose super stinky you can

757
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:32,430
smell it from like you know a hundred

758
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:34,620
feet away type of thing when I opened it

759
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:37,860
at a show people come in depending on

760
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:39,899
the way the air is is flowing but nobody

761
00:32:37,859 --> 00:32:42,449
can believe that that [ __ ] is six years

762
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:44,880
old now it was left in herb you know in

763
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:46,620
bud and I froze the bud and I just

764
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:49,920
squished it maybe three or four months

765
00:32:46,619 --> 00:32:51,719
ago now I'm not even sure but you can do

766
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:54,509
some amazing things with older material

767
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:58,230
go ahead the most important thing once

768
00:32:54,509 --> 00:33:00,359
you have it frozen percent you 100% I

769
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:02,940
mean my god it lasted that that's what

770
00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:06,990
makes a difference you can freeze resin

771
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:09,090
for a decade barely cake bingo and

772
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:11,250
that's what you know that's that's what

773
00:33:09,089 --> 00:33:13,319
you can do if you're forced to have herb

774
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:16,410
in storage for long periods of time

775
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:19,730
don't let it be ruined just store it in

776
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:19,730
a freezer I mean

777
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:25,289
is it like if it starts raining and

778
00:33:22,289 --> 00:33:29,700
stuff you can harvest the plants freeze

779
00:33:25,289 --> 00:33:32,369
them before you drive them at all then

780
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:37,019
then what you can do is you can take

781
00:33:32,369 --> 00:33:38,669
them out later as you need them and hang

782
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:41,940
them up to dry and let them dry in a

783
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:44,640
normal two-week drive and their barn the

784
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:46,980
color changes a little bit the colors

785
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:49,920
darken up a little bit from the freezing

786
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:52,890
but except with that man it works

787
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:55,289
don't be easy I love that everything you

788
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:59,850
say is first-hand experience like you

789
00:33:55,289 --> 00:34:02,819
guaranteed did this to crops absolutely

790
00:33:59,849 --> 00:34:06,178
I'd never did people I know didn't have

791
00:34:02,819 --> 00:34:08,878
enough room to dry they lived in a

792
00:34:06,179 --> 00:34:11,960
little tiny Shack and they had no place

793
00:34:08,878 --> 00:34:16,460
else to dry so but they had a freezer

794
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:23,280
deep freeze so they filled it up and

795
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:25,050
close it out you know had room it

796
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:29,730
reminds me of Switzerland back in like

797
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:31,440
early 2000 2001 2002 and suddenly you

798
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:33,389
know they were kind of allowing it as an

799
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:36,090
aromatherapy product if you put the bud

800
00:34:33,389 --> 00:34:37,858
in a little little pillow pouch they

801
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:40,320
could sell it at stores and so people

802
00:34:37,858 --> 00:34:41,759
were growing just there was no licensing

803
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,500
it was Swiss style it was just like any

804
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,720
can just grow it and so people were like

805
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:47,668
boom like putting up acres and acres and

806
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:49,378
acres just the most ridiculous amount of

807
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:52,168
cannabis and some of the barns that I

808
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:53,549
saw I mean it was it was inspiring and

809
00:34:52,168 --> 00:34:56,128
then it was like heart-wrenching because

810
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:57,900
it was so much of the material and I'm

811
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:59,699
sure you guys remember intro talking

812
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:01,530
about this back in the day of like him

813
00:34:59,699 --> 00:35:04,710
going in and cleaning out the mouse piss

814
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:06,810
and the mouse [ __ ] like the the herb

815
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:08,280
just molded it was just they packed it

816
00:35:06,809 --> 00:35:09,750
so tight into these barns because they

817
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:11,640
didn't have enough room to dry it and it

818
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:13,500
would have just been incredible had they

819
00:35:11,639 --> 00:35:16,679
had a system where they could freeze a

820
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:19,380
large scale freezers and just you know

821
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:21,000
process it as as they could you know and

822
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:24,480
that's that's the problem with biomass

823
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:26,849
if you can only process 100 100 kilos a

824
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:30,000
day and you've harvested three or four

825
00:35:26,849 --> 00:35:31,829
hundred thousand kilos you're just it's

826
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,730
not it's it's not going to be conducive

827
00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:35,279
to a

828
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:39,059
proper workflow which might not be easy

829
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:41,960
either what's that said breezy that

830
00:35:39,059 --> 00:35:45,299
large amount may not be that easy this

831
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:47,039
one kind of a big preview well I'm

832
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:49,080
looking at them right now industrial

833
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:51,750
scale you know the half a million two

834
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:53,819
million dollar freeze dryers and man are

835
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:57,750
they inspirational the the you know to

836
00:35:53,820 --> 00:36:02,490
be able to freeze-dry fifty kilos of or

837
00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:06,239
five ten ten to fifty kilos of bubble at

838
00:36:02,489 --> 00:36:08,549
a time sure you can put about I think

839
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:10,529
it's about five kilos and a freeze dryer

840
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:12,810
you know in a harvest right I think in

841
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:14,190
the big the large scientific one you can

842
00:36:12,809 --> 00:36:16,469
do about five kilos we want to be able

843
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:19,108
to do 50 to 100 kilos without having a

844
00:36:16,469 --> 00:36:20,730
wall of freeze dryer so we've been

845
00:36:19,108 --> 00:36:36,029
looking at these industrial ones and

846
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:58,349
they are no joke all the air out of

847
00:36:36,030 --> 00:37:00,050
those warehouse yeah I suspect as well

848
00:36:58,349 --> 00:37:02,759
that you'll have large-scale

849
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:03,750
refrigeration and pulling the oxygen out

850
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:06,240
of the air and replacing it with

851
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:07,619
nitrogen is definitely another way to I

852
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:09,299
mean there's you know what it's funny

853
00:37:07,619 --> 00:37:11,850
Mike because all of these things that

854
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:14,190
we're looking to discover are already

855
00:37:11,849 --> 00:37:16,559
being done in other industries like

856
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:19,108
almost every aspect of what we're

857
00:37:16,559 --> 00:37:20,969
looking to do for scalability when it

858
00:37:19,108 --> 00:37:22,739
comes into the tissue culture aspect

859
00:37:20,969 --> 00:37:24,539
when it comes into large-scale freezing

860
00:37:22,739 --> 00:37:26,579
and drying curing when it comes to

861
00:37:24,539 --> 00:37:29,400
large-scale processing these things

862
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:32,579
already exist on a very large scale

863
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:35,970
throughout the agricultural community in

864
00:37:32,579 --> 00:37:38,159
from seed crops vegetables to whatever

865
00:37:35,969 --> 00:37:40,439
so it's just gonna be really a matter of

866
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:42,750
you know tweaking out some of those

867
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:44,730
things and and getting proper engineers

868
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:46,800
with proper hash makers and harvesters

869
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:48,090
and trimmers and cures and all the

870
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:51,570
people that do all these different jobs

871
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:54,440
to get these things really you know sort

872
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:58,530
of created into a proper workflow that

873
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:59,400
that that will that won't sacrifice

874
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:02,490
quality

875
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:04,050
don't forget the chemist man I could

876
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:06,809
never forget the chemist a lot of what

877
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:08,640
we're doing mark is is chemistry and I'm

878
00:38:06,809 --> 00:38:10,259
sure we're gonna have you out at one

879
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:12,259
point in time to come visit this place

880
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:15,810
because it's going to be the Willy Wonka

881
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:17,610
calorie lab even if you love it

882
00:38:15,809 --> 00:38:20,969
I can't wait when you were describing

883
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:23,099
sitting before mark that's very similar

884
00:38:20,969 --> 00:38:25,529
to a process that's used in the pigment

885
00:38:23,099 --> 00:38:28,589
industry the separating pigment for

886
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:31,490
paint and coatings and and so they have

887
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:33,900
these industrial sivir

888
00:38:31,489 --> 00:38:37,979
scales that you wouldn't believe I mean

889
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:42,539
it would fill silos I mean just huge

890
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:44,670
gigantic things and and one thing I

891
00:38:42,539 --> 00:38:46,619
haven't always learned and I guess you

892
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:49,980
guys will learn this everyone will learn

893
00:38:46,619 --> 00:38:52,019
this no matter what you do whenever you

894
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:54,900
scale something up like if you're taking

895
00:38:52,019 --> 00:38:57,150
something from like the experimental Rd

896
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:59,910
scale to maybe like the smaller

897
00:38:57,150 --> 00:39:02,519
production scale to the like ultimate

898
00:38:59,909 --> 00:39:07,769
like huge levels of production you

899
00:39:02,519 --> 00:39:09,570
always find new I won't call them issues

900
00:39:07,769 --> 00:39:12,360
but just thing is there's always new

901
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:14,070
things to deal with when you're working

902
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:15,750
at such a small scale you may not

903
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:18,360
realize that you're generating say

904
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:21,210
something that could do what chemists

905
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:22,789
would call a runaway reaction which is

906
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:26,010
something that you couldn't necessarily

907
00:39:22,789 --> 00:39:28,110
predict on a really small scale but when

908
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:30,720
you have stuff sitting around at that

909
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:33,059
temperature at that stage in the process

910
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:34,559
now you're gonna have heat buildup or

911
00:39:33,059 --> 00:39:37,079
something else is going to happen and

912
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:39,360
you always always find new stuff

913
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:41,699
whenever you go to it's just like making

914
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:44,420
coffee you know making coffee in a gonna

915
00:39:41,699 --> 00:39:47,250
in a k-cup versus making a pot of coffee

916
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:49,170
versus just making a huge amount of I

917
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:50,610
mean it's just it's totally it's a you

918
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:52,619
always find new [ __ ]

919
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:54,840
like you were talking about microbial

920
00:39:52,619 --> 00:39:57,000
build-up there's always just set

921
00:39:54,840 --> 00:40:00,600
sediments that build up sedimentation

922
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:02,460
and a lot of these batch processes which

923
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:04,589
sounds like most of what you guys are

924
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:07,349
running or what I would call a batch

925
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:08,940
process as opposed to a continuous

926
00:40:07,349 --> 00:40:11,279
process which is just the switch that

927
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:14,039
you turn on and oil comes out or ash

928
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:16,380
comes out just some continuous like

929
00:40:14,039 --> 00:40:18,599
think of like a VTA unit is like the oil

930
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:20,970
machine right as long as you have it

931
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:23,639
backed up with precursor you just turn

932
00:40:20,969 --> 00:40:25,169
on that switch and shale machine just

933
00:40:23,639 --> 00:40:27,420
oil starts coming out right that's a

934
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:30,000
continuous process versus a batch

935
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:33,240
process which I like your two liters

936
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,250
smaller you know distillation where you

937
00:40:33,239 --> 00:40:37,199
need to like fill it each time and like

938
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:38,820
baking a cake you you make your

939
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:40,469
distillate and then you need to clean it

940
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:43,559
out and you need to you know the

941
00:40:40,469 --> 00:40:45,989
cleaning as a you know really a function

942
00:40:43,559 --> 00:40:48,029
of the overall process is one of the

943
00:40:45,989 --> 00:40:50,039
most important parts to make sure that

944
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:51,930
you clean your reactor and get

945
00:40:50,039 --> 00:40:54,239
everything clean for the next batch so

946
00:40:51,929 --> 00:40:55,919
you don't have you know contamination

947
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:58,349
and it's just it's a really important

948
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:00,630
thing when you go to scale things up if

949
00:40:58,349 --> 00:41:02,670
you were to take like a two liter you

950
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:05,160
know distillation and go to like a 20

951
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:07,260
liter distillation there's gonna be

952
00:41:05,159 --> 00:41:09,269
issues that you just can't predict until

953
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:10,650
you're running that distillation and

954
00:41:09,269 --> 00:41:13,259
you're doing that equipment you know

955
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:15,800
you're now that's why listen you have to

956
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:19,230
you have to design these units

957
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:22,730
specifically with the intent of not only

958
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:26,490
producing that quality and the quality

959
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:28,440
quantity as well but with the in mind

960
00:41:26,489 --> 00:41:30,659
that you're going to be needing to clean

961
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:32,250
these units a lot and the cleaning has

962
00:41:30,659 --> 00:41:33,569
to be effective and it has to be a part

963
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:35,670
of the workflow and it has to be

964
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:37,740
somewhat quick you can't have downtime

965
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:41,099
for days because you need to clean your

966
00:41:37,739 --> 00:41:42,929
monster unit and yeah it's it's super

967
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:45,000
important sorry I muted you there mark I

968
00:41:42,929 --> 00:41:46,829
just yeah the other thing I wanted to

969
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,750
add and again people who are you know

970
00:41:46,829 --> 00:41:51,239
again thinking about this kind of thing

971
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:54,630
is you want to add an area in your

972
00:41:51,239 --> 00:41:56,250
facility for this cleaning because you

973
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:57,750
don't want to have that cleaning in your

974
00:41:56,250 --> 00:42:00,269
production area you almost want to take

975
00:41:57,750 --> 00:42:03,059
it into like a side area where you can

976
00:42:00,269 --> 00:42:05,519
do cleaning away from like if you can

977
00:42:03,059 --> 00:42:07,889
back it up with a second unit while your

978
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:09,329
team is cleaning one unit you could you

979
00:42:07,889 --> 00:42:11,489
you you know what I mean I mean you want

980
00:42:09,329 --> 00:42:13,710
you want to allocate space for cleaning

981
00:42:11,489 --> 00:42:14,489
if you're looking at putting a floor

982
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:17,039
plan or

983
00:42:14,489 --> 00:42:21,358
planning the use of space in an area I

984
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:24,059
think cleaning space is well you know

985
00:42:21,358 --> 00:42:27,269
well you use space in this kind of

986
00:42:24,059 --> 00:42:30,239
operation yeah absolutely agreed

987
00:42:27,269 --> 00:42:32,820
although I guess the cryo ethanol unit

988
00:42:30,239 --> 00:42:34,409
can work by just running ethanol through

989
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:37,080
the unit you don't really have to like

990
00:42:34,409 --> 00:42:39,929
take that unit away and yeah are you

991
00:42:37,079 --> 00:42:42,598
getting free-floating plant material or

992
00:42:39,929 --> 00:42:44,940
is it in socks or like how is the cryo

993
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:47,338
ethanol wow that but that all that IP

994
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:50,880
belongs to my partner Anthony who runs

995
00:42:47,338 --> 00:42:51,570
infinite CBD and sinner tech down in

996
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:54,480
Colorado

997
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:57,570
so he'd really be the one to talk about

998
00:42:54,480 --> 00:43:00,690
that he's gonna be the one running that

999
00:42:57,570 --> 00:43:03,510
aspect of the lab I'm not a co2 or an

1000
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:04,829
ethanol guy but we'll get him on past

1001
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:06,390
church here one of these days maybe even

1002
00:43:04,829 --> 00:43:09,088
today I'll invite him on to talk a

1003
00:43:06,389 --> 00:43:11,400
little bit about cryo ethanol it's not

1004
00:43:09,088 --> 00:43:12,929
impossible if he's coming if he's coming

1005
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:15,990
to the fish show check me out at the

1006
00:43:12,929 --> 00:43:17,969
Bliss lounge before the show Tom

1007
00:43:15,989 --> 00:43:20,129
Marshall is gonna be there and signing

1008
00:43:17,969 --> 00:43:24,000
people's things so I'm gonna get a

1009
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:26,700
selfie with Tom Marshall and say hi and

1010
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:30,510
yeah if he's listening let's let's hook

1011
00:43:26,699 --> 00:43:32,088
up at the Bliss Lounge at Dick's at fish

1012
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:36,240
if you're gonna be there

1013
00:43:32,088 --> 00:43:39,239
absolutely man I wish I was I wish we

1014
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:41,399
you're here to mark I'll channel yeah

1015
00:43:39,239 --> 00:43:43,858
I'll do a live stream tonight and I'll

1016
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:45,450
put you on camera buddy dude that's

1017
00:43:43,858 --> 00:43:47,909
that's the way I go to fish shows now

1018
00:43:45,449 --> 00:43:49,858
actually I know I know you

1019
00:43:47,909 --> 00:43:55,319
vicarious ly through me brother that

1020
00:43:49,858 --> 00:43:59,460
that's cool 100% mr. miner mr. miner

1021
00:43:55,320 --> 00:44:03,269
also sends me his couch s tour links and

1022
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:05,099
so I got a give mister yeah we know mr.

1023
00:44:03,269 --> 00:44:08,608
miner I know I'm pretty well I've danced

1024
00:44:05,099 --> 00:44:11,220
around that dude for damn near what 20

1025
00:44:08,608 --> 00:44:13,348
25 years yeah Hanks Bob a lot of people

1026
00:44:11,219 --> 00:44:15,899
it shows well you know our curve ball

1027
00:44:13,349 --> 00:44:17,849
this festival here in upstate New York

1028
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:20,369
was canceled I know I don't know if you

1029
00:44:17,849 --> 00:44:22,769
heard this but yeah there was a camp I

1030
00:44:20,369 --> 00:44:24,900
saw it I heard it I saw the photo of the

1031
00:44:22,769 --> 00:44:25,519
guy telling Trey on stage while it was

1032
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:27,619
helping

1033
00:44:25,519 --> 00:44:32,150
happening I was all over it but I should

1034
00:44:27,619 --> 00:44:33,920
say Thank You mr. miner it was a real

1035
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:35,809
heartbreaking thing so I mean there's a

1036
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:38,720
lot of energy from that closed down

1037
00:44:35,809 --> 00:44:42,259
festival that kind of is sort of

1038
00:44:38,719 --> 00:44:46,569
centralized here in Denver and yeah last

1039
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:46,570
night of the three night run tonight so

1040
00:44:50,469 --> 00:44:56,149
small poncho pot poncho says small bats

1041
00:44:53,539 --> 00:44:58,309
will always be the highest grade and I I

1042
00:44:56,150 --> 00:45:00,200
tend to agree with them but it's also

1043
00:44:58,309 --> 00:45:02,449
the obstacle that I want to turn into

1044
00:45:00,199 --> 00:45:04,099
the opportunity to change that statement

1045
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:06,469
I want to see that statement change and

1046
00:45:04,099 --> 00:45:08,779
it was really skunk man Sam who kind of

1047
00:45:06,469 --> 00:45:09,980
changed that for me when you know he we

1048
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:11,150
were sitting down one time and he just

1049
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:12,920
said you know all these people that

1050
00:45:11,150 --> 00:45:15,500
think you can't grow super-awesome

1051
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:17,030
herb large-scale are just wrong I know

1052
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:19,909
because I've done it and I've seen it

1053
00:45:17,030 --> 00:45:22,250
and I've you know he has he's grown like

1054
00:45:19,909 --> 00:45:23,779
fields of cannabis that it are like of

1055
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:25,639
the highest quality that if you

1056
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:28,010
extracted the resin and you smoked it

1057
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:30,949
you surely wouldn't be like yeah it's

1058
00:45:28,010 --> 00:45:33,800
okay it's like at the top echelon of

1059
00:45:30,949 --> 00:45:36,019
greatness and so I'm thinking why can't

1060
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:38,090
we to do the same thing with extraction

1061
00:45:36,019 --> 00:45:39,829
that's what we need to do to make it

1062
00:45:38,090 --> 00:45:41,990
available to make it accessible for

1063
00:45:39,829 --> 00:45:44,619
everyone the highest quality we need to

1064
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:47,629
figure out that obstacle of overcoming

1065
00:45:44,619 --> 00:45:52,639
scalability and so it's a mission that

1066
00:45:47,630 --> 00:45:54,619
I'm on hey Marcus I just wanted to

1067
00:45:52,639 --> 00:45:56,599
comment on temperature too I mean yeah

1068
00:45:54,619 --> 00:45:59,809
whenever you look at any chemical

1069
00:45:56,599 --> 00:46:01,929
degradation process the cooler you could

1070
00:45:59,809 --> 00:46:05,840
make things the slower that degradation

1071
00:46:01,929 --> 00:46:10,460
process becomes so that yeah you think

1072
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:12,890
things hold in the dark and dry very Sam

1073
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:14,539
good advice 100% good advice and

1074
00:46:12,889 --> 00:46:17,179
definitely something that we're paying

1075
00:46:14,539 --> 00:46:18,400
careful attention to cold cold cold cold

1076
00:46:17,179 --> 00:46:21,129
cold

1077
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:22,970
we're gonna design this problem yourself

1078
00:46:21,130 --> 00:46:25,610
the other thing you got to remember

1079
00:46:22,969 --> 00:46:28,279
these deep these chiller units throw a

1080
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:31,070
lot of heat into the room that they live

1081
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:33,440
in so if like if you're if your area is

1082
00:46:31,070 --> 00:46:35,809
like a confined area and you have

1083
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:38,420
chiller units that are running to chill

1084
00:46:35,809 --> 00:46:39,500
various parts of your operation those

1085
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:41,570
chillers through

1086
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:43,909
a lot of heat in the area so you want to

1087
00:46:41,570 --> 00:46:46,130
make sure that you know again you have a

1088
00:46:43,909 --> 00:46:49,129
way to remove the heat from that room

1089
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:50,750
if you can't ya know these are all parts

1090
00:46:49,130 --> 00:46:52,340
of the design we're looking at putting

1091
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:53,869
certain things on the roof we were

1092
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:55,519
trying to get them on the outside of the

1093
00:46:53,869 --> 00:46:57,289
building but some of the limitations

1094
00:46:55,519 --> 00:46:59,059
with the property footprint won't allow

1095
00:46:57,289 --> 00:47:00,829
for that so we're definitely on the

1096
00:46:59,059 --> 00:47:03,820
first meeting I walked through first

1097
00:47:00,829 --> 00:47:07,340
with Mike I did a great video with Mike

1098
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:08,539
in the specific we'll be able to release

1099
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:10,610
it at one point in time but you know the

1100
00:47:08,539 --> 00:47:12,440
project's just in its infancy stages so

1101
00:47:10,610 --> 00:47:14,990
we're gonna kind of leave that as a

1102
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:17,570
little bit more on the down-low

1103
00:47:14,989 --> 00:47:19,250
but definitely the second walkthrough

1104
00:47:17,570 --> 00:47:20,809
that I did well actually the fourth or

1105
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:23,989
fifth walkthrough I did was with a team

1106
00:47:20,809 --> 00:47:27,079
of 25 people construction electrician's

1107
00:47:23,989 --> 00:47:28,759
engineers architects the whole nine

1108
00:47:27,079 --> 00:47:31,400
yards we started walking through this

1109
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:32,720
facility and it's quite incredible when

1110
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:34,670
you get that many brilliant minds

1111
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:37,369
together specifically you know a lot of

1112
00:47:34,670 --> 00:47:39,650
moving parts to start focusing on on a

1113
00:47:37,369 --> 00:47:41,750
project and you just go room by room and

1114
00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:43,670
you just basically you write down the

1115
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:45,949
pain points the obstacles that are in

1116
00:47:43,670 --> 00:47:48,380
your way and then you get those minds on

1117
00:47:45,949 --> 00:47:51,019
you know taking those pain points apart

1118
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:53,090
and and offering relief to each one so

1119
00:47:51,019 --> 00:47:55,849
it's an exciting thing to be a part of

1120
00:47:53,090 --> 00:47:58,220
obviously you know like Kuban mentioned

1121
00:47:55,849 --> 00:48:01,069
there's this large scale fear that comes

1122
00:47:58,219 --> 00:48:02,599
with large scale scalability but you

1123
00:48:01,070 --> 00:48:06,110
can't let that fear keep you from

1124
00:48:02,599 --> 00:48:07,670
pushing the boundaries you know we may

1125
00:48:06,110 --> 00:48:09,650
not be the only ones that are doing this

1126
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:12,230
but the work that we do is definitely

1127
00:48:09,650 --> 00:48:15,170
going to affect the community much like

1128
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:17,389
the work that that we did with bubble

1129
00:48:15,170 --> 00:48:19,309
bags over the years has has deeply

1130
00:48:17,389 --> 00:48:22,609
affected the community I mean I'll tell

1131
00:48:19,309 --> 00:48:25,219
you 1999 pre bubble bags was a different

1132
00:48:22,610 --> 00:48:27,769
world in the world of extractions it was

1133
00:48:25,219 --> 00:48:31,219
a real different world this whole full

1134
00:48:27,769 --> 00:48:33,769
mel bubble and you know 99.9% heads sure

1135
00:48:31,219 --> 00:48:35,359
Sam was on the boat but he was it was a

1136
00:48:33,769 --> 00:48:38,000
very lonely journey because he was

1137
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:40,340
literally the only one and so now you

1138
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:43,070
know most people on this panel have made

1139
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:45,500
it have have access to it it's just kind

1140
00:48:43,070 --> 00:48:51,550
of a no-brainer water ice beautiful

1141
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:53,309
plant matter walk-in freezer

1142
00:48:51,550 --> 00:48:58,080
operate

1143
00:48:53,309 --> 00:49:03,480
Center process you know 50 or so kilos a

1144
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:07,139
day really easy I that was Lobo back I

1145
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:13,500
mean once I realized that I can operate

1146
00:49:07,139 --> 00:49:15,089
this dissecting machine in the middle of

1147
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:17,670
the summer time when it was hot and

1148
00:49:15,090 --> 00:49:20,460
humid which normally that puts a

1149
00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:23,250
screeching halt for our safety hundred

1150
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:26,789
percent when you've got a cold and dry

1151
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:28,949
then you can do it year-round

1152
00:49:26,789 --> 00:49:31,500
you just have to free some material

1153
00:49:28,949 --> 00:49:35,480
overnight and we're equip it in the

1154
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:38,250
morning and keep it [ __ ] cold and dry

1155
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:39,329
ya know it's it's it's a big changer

1156
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:41,670
it's one of the beautiful things about

1157
00:49:39,329 --> 00:49:45,029
living in Canada I will say because the

1158
00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:46,710
winters tend to be cold and dry and so

1159
00:49:45,030 --> 00:49:48,890
you've obviously seen some of the dry

1160
00:49:46,710 --> 00:49:50,639
sifting videos I hope that I put out on

1161
00:49:48,889 --> 00:49:53,659
the man's world

1162
00:49:50,639 --> 00:49:56,839
he works when the winter's that way I

1163
00:49:53,659 --> 00:50:00,269
didn't invent it it was invented by

1164
00:49:56,840 --> 00:50:06,150
people in Afghanistan other places and

1165
00:50:00,269 --> 00:50:07,920
says the best 15 is when it's cold yeah

1166
00:50:06,150 --> 00:50:09,780
absolutely well you may not have

1167
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:12,659
invented it but you certainly had a deep

1168
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:14,610
impact on the world of hash makers I'll

1169
00:50:12,659 --> 00:50:17,190
tell you just in that moment where you

1170
00:50:14,610 --> 00:50:19,110
allowed me to photograph your resin when

1171
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:21,059
I first met Sam back in the day he was

1172
00:50:19,110 --> 00:50:23,250
just he was almost like there was all I

1173
00:50:21,059 --> 00:50:24,630
was almost afraid he was like the

1174
00:50:23,250 --> 00:50:26,909
professor he just had so much knowledge

1175
00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:28,769
I didn't want to offend him I didn't you

1176
00:50:26,909 --> 00:50:30,750
know he's very particular fellow in the

1177
00:50:28,769 --> 00:50:33,719
sense that that he was just he just was

1178
00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:35,369
a no [ __ ] around kind of guy and so you

1179
00:50:33,719 --> 00:50:37,230
know if you know I didn't even want to

1180
00:50:35,369 --> 00:50:39,420
ask him hey could I photograph your

1181
00:50:37,230 --> 00:50:42,329
resin but at one point after a few trips

1182
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:44,400
to his house I I asked I said hey can I

1183
00:50:42,329 --> 00:50:46,590
can I photograph your resume he's like

1184
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:50,460
yeah sure why not then that you know

1185
00:50:46,590 --> 00:50:52,079
that photograph of that 99.9% heads that

1186
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:54,510
was the first time that a photograph

1187
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:56,519
like that showed up on the Internet in

1188
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:59,160
the cannabis world and I'll tell you it

1189
00:50:56,519 --> 00:51:02,550
really really really affected a lot of

1190
00:50:59,159 --> 00:51:06,469
people in regards to what can be done it

1191
00:51:02,550 --> 00:51:09,450
showed the masses it is possible

1192
00:51:06,469 --> 00:51:11,219
absolutely.i I [ __ ] myself damn near

1193
00:51:09,449 --> 00:51:12,809
when I took that picture in your living

1194
00:51:11,219 --> 00:51:14,549
room when I saw what was before I took

1195
00:51:12,809 --> 00:51:17,039
the picture when I focused the camera

1196
00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:20,280
and saw what your hash looked like under

1197
00:51:17,039 --> 00:51:22,019
a microscope I just couldn't I couldn't

1198
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:24,210
believe it I could not believe that you

1199
00:51:22,019 --> 00:51:26,130
did that with dry said dry sifting like

1200
00:51:24,210 --> 00:51:28,710
that you didn't that you didn't use

1201
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:32,160
water water just was so easy to extract

1202
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:34,590
the heads but then it's also extracting

1203
00:51:32,159 --> 00:51:37,079
these water-soluble x' it's it's pulling

1204
00:51:34,590 --> 00:51:39,480
something out the waters smelly the

1205
00:51:37,079 --> 00:51:41,759
waters dark it's it's not staying in the

1206
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:43,889
hash and you know Sam had all of that

1207
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:46,140
presence in his hash so it was

1208
00:51:43,889 --> 00:51:48,779
definitely a big shout out to him and

1209
00:51:46,139 --> 00:51:51,210
shout out to Cuban for helping keep the

1210
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:53,070
popularization going and shout-out to D

1211
00:51:51,210 --> 00:51:55,079
for 20k and shout out to all the hash

1212
00:51:53,070 --> 00:51:58,080
makers for that for that matter as well

1213
00:51:55,079 --> 00:52:00,029
as the growers because [ __ ] we are

1214
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:03,299
nothing without you we are nothing

1215
00:52:00,030 --> 00:52:05,790
without the growers that's my that's my

1216
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:08,310
humble opinion should we get a nice big

1217
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:20,300
bong ripen or what yeah come on say it

1218
00:52:08,309 --> 00:52:25,108
say what about the steep makers people

1219
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:28,650
absolutely what about the landrace

1220
00:52:25,108 --> 00:52:30,389
farmers yeah I'll shout out the land

1221
00:52:28,650 --> 00:52:31,858
I'll shout out everyone keep going dude

1222
00:52:30,389 --> 00:52:33,389
will shout at the land raise farmers

1223
00:52:31,858 --> 00:52:35,670
will shout out the seed collectors

1224
00:52:33,389 --> 00:52:37,949
because those those guys did some

1225
00:52:35,670 --> 00:52:39,750
important work collecting you know Sam

1226
00:52:37,949 --> 00:52:41,549
going and living in all the hash

1227
00:52:39,750 --> 00:52:43,889
producing countries and collecting those

1228
00:52:41,550 --> 00:52:45,660
seeds back in the time where it was you

1229
00:52:43,889 --> 00:52:49,889
know probably fairly dangerous to do

1230
00:52:45,659 --> 00:52:53,159
that work that was also huge even the

1231
00:52:49,889 --> 00:52:58,679
land rice farmers I mean the present

1232
00:52:53,159 --> 00:53:03,269
land rice farmers are really only there

1233
00:52:58,679 --> 00:53:06,868
they're just present caretakers of the

1234
00:53:03,269 --> 00:53:09,000
energy because it meets some of these

1235
00:53:06,869 --> 00:53:13,730
lab races I mean the Heritage has been

1236
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:16,280
going on for hundreds of years it

1237
00:53:13,730 --> 00:53:18,530
it's incredible it's quite interesting

1238
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:21,350
the jaw the shoulders of giants that we

1239
00:53:18,530 --> 00:53:23,090
all sit upon it whether you are aware of

1240
00:53:21,349 --> 00:53:23,659
the history that brought this to you or

1241
00:53:23,090 --> 00:53:25,670
not

1242
00:53:23,659 --> 00:53:27,799
some of the prohibition that occurred

1243
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:30,559
you know the yanking of the teeth out in

1244
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:32,780
the Cairo square for the for the Sufis

1245
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:35,779
like a lot of people suffered a lot of

1246
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:38,450
years for this plant to thrive and

1247
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:46,040
continue to be collected to be grown to

1248
00:53:38,449 --> 00:53:48,019
be processed and to be vaporized I mean

1249
00:53:46,039 --> 00:53:50,000
that's powerful to you know from

1250
00:53:48,019 --> 00:53:54,019
generation to generation and I feel like

1251
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:56,329
the internet really knew things up to

1252
00:53:54,019 --> 00:53:58,880
when it came to cannabis thanks to like

1253
00:53:56,329 --> 00:54:02,059
that picture that you took and of Sam's

1254
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:03,410
work it motivated me to be able to

1255
00:54:02,059 --> 00:54:05,599
figure out what to do with a bunch of

1256
00:54:03,409 --> 00:54:07,339
Keef that I had sitting around without

1257
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:10,460
the internet would have never seen it

1258
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:12,559
you know so that's powerful and I got a

1259
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:14,329
I had a thought cuz the other a lot of

1260
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:17,179
people are like man waters a solvent and

1261
00:54:14,329 --> 00:54:18,710
I heard you say it last week and I don't

1262
00:54:17,179 --> 00:54:20,299
get into those type of talks because to

1263
00:54:18,710 --> 00:54:22,400
me you know if it's not butane or

1264
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:22,609
whatever then to me hash is hash you

1265
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:26,329
know

1266
00:54:22,608 --> 00:54:30,759
but if water is a solvent it's keef and

1267
00:54:26,329 --> 00:54:33,710
dry sift the only real deal not solve it

1268
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:36,230
well it's the least it's the least

1269
00:54:33,710 --> 00:54:38,539
footprint so whenever you use anything

1270
00:54:36,230 --> 00:54:40,369
to extract you leave a footprint or you

1271
00:54:38,539 --> 00:54:42,650
extract something that leaves that

1272
00:54:40,369 --> 00:54:44,300
footprint so with water hash it's simple

1273
00:54:42,650 --> 00:54:46,550
whatever we're pulling out into the

1274
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:48,859
water is our footprint it's what's been

1275
00:54:46,550 --> 00:54:50,780
removed from the hash and there's those

1276
00:54:48,858 --> 00:54:54,380
processes occur in all forms of

1277
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:58,930
extraction but with with solvents leave

1278
00:54:54,380 --> 00:55:02,570
behind some of the alcohol or the phot

1279
00:54:58,929 --> 00:55:05,449
Ameche tested afterwards you can usually

1280
00:55:02,570 --> 00:55:07,670
find a tiny bit of that with water all

1281
00:55:05,449 --> 00:55:10,339
you have to do is drag those open and

1282
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:12,950
the footprint is gone from the materials

1283
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:14,990
but it's still you know and I will say

1284
00:55:12,949 --> 00:55:18,409
this Cuban the highest quality of water

1285
00:55:14,989 --> 00:55:20,000
hash I've had is absolutely on point for

1286
00:55:18,409 --> 00:55:22,879
the highest quality dry sip that I've

1287
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:25,190
had when you break into most those tens

1288
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:27,360
I II it's been grown like a ten out of

1289
00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:30,000
ten it's been processed and

1290
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:32,880
cured like a ten out of ten to me

1291
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:35,760
they're right on par but generally most

1292
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:37,710
people's water hash is not a ten so

1293
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:41,070
anytime you get like a sift that's a

1294
00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:43,470
nine whatever or upwards of a ten it's

1295
00:55:41,070 --> 00:55:45,090
gonna seem nicer than most water hashes

1296
00:55:43,469 --> 00:55:46,769
that being said when you have that six

1297
00:55:45,090 --> 00:55:48,600
star water hash that drips away to

1298
00:55:46,769 --> 00:55:51,449
nothing and has all the flavor of the

1299
00:55:48,599 --> 00:55:53,400
bud for me they're both on point I would

1300
00:55:51,449 --> 00:55:57,029
have a hard time picking one over the

1301
00:55:53,400 --> 00:56:03,059
others but you just don't get the same

1302
00:55:57,030 --> 00:56:06,600
yields from dry so most people but much

1303
00:56:03,059 --> 00:56:08,549
higher yields yeah that's true as well I

1304
00:56:06,599 --> 00:56:10,949
mean even while we were in Jamaica and

1305
00:56:08,550 --> 00:56:13,890
you had that beautiful dry sift and we

1306
00:56:10,949 --> 00:56:16,409
made that beautiful water hash I think

1307
00:56:13,889 --> 00:56:18,299
we smoked them both pretty you know like

1308
00:56:16,409 --> 00:56:19,920
I don't remember just smoking all of the

1309
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:21,480
dry sip till it was gone and then

1310
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:23,130
smoking the water hash which is

1311
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:26,039
generally what I do when something's

1312
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:28,530
just better if something's much better

1313
00:56:26,039 --> 00:56:30,900
it's a very easy decision and it's why

1314
00:56:28,530 --> 00:56:33,600
you know it's why we I kind of had that

1315
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:35,160
idea for legends we're you know legends

1316
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:38,009
of hash but we don't have to judge it

1317
00:56:35,159 --> 00:56:41,460
why don't we just put like a gram or two

1318
00:56:38,010 --> 00:56:44,250
grams of everybody's hash out on the

1319
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:46,710
table on a separate plate and the hash

1320
00:56:44,250 --> 00:56:47,309
that's gone first and just taking you

1321
00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:49,139
know a hit

1322
00:56:47,309 --> 00:56:51,119
not taking like half a gram each time

1323
00:56:49,139 --> 00:56:52,769
but just taking your one or two hits

1324
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:55,049
from each one because there could be 20

1325
00:56:52,769 --> 00:56:58,110
or 30 or 40 varieties on the table and

1326
00:56:55,050 --> 00:57:00,420
that's 20 or 30 or 40 hits just take one

1327
00:56:58,110 --> 00:57:02,849
hit of each one and see which one you go

1328
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:05,400
back to because it whittles down like

1329
00:57:02,849 --> 00:57:07,380
any connoisseur forty cultivars on the

1330
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:09,420
table he'll know the top five right away

1331
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:10,920
by looking at them and then by smoking

1332
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:12,539
them he'll Whittle it down to light this

1333
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:14,430
is the one I just I don't know I just

1334
00:57:12,539 --> 00:57:16,710
keep taking it until it's gone and then

1335
00:57:14,429 --> 00:57:18,989
it's sort of like a nod to the hash

1336
00:57:16,710 --> 00:57:22,019
maker very much like how some of the

1337
00:57:18,989 --> 00:57:23,729
Baba's do it in Shivaratri in Nepal

1338
00:57:22,019 --> 00:57:25,230
where when it's Shiva's birthday and

1339
00:57:23,730 --> 00:57:27,510
they have these hash gatherings my

1340
00:57:25,230 --> 00:57:28,829
manufacturers told me that's exactly how

1341
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:30,690
they do it they put it out on the plate

1342
00:57:28,829 --> 00:57:32,670
and whoever's plate is empty first

1343
00:57:30,690 --> 00:57:34,740
everyone you know gives their respect

1344
00:57:32,670 --> 00:57:36,300
that way and I think that's a really

1345
00:57:34,739 --> 00:57:39,689
kind of cool way to do it the People's

1346
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:41,280
Choice yeah I like that they did that

1347
00:57:39,690 --> 00:57:44,880
similar style with the

1348
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:47,340
the invitational they had a nice dinner

1349
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:48,630
they had everyone brought their own jar

1350
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:50,789
and it just started getting passed

1351
00:57:48,630 --> 00:57:53,070
around until there was a unanimous

1352
00:57:50,789 --> 00:57:56,340
decision who had the heat I didn't

1353
00:57:53,070 --> 00:57:58,350
attend but it sounded cool you know

1354
00:57:56,340 --> 00:58:01,530
III definitely get that water hash and

1355
00:57:58,349 --> 00:58:02,670
rice if comparison personally I really

1356
00:58:01,530 --> 00:58:04,500
like water hash

1357
00:58:02,670 --> 00:58:08,789
I like water hash mother and rice if

1358
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:11,880
myself if it's good water hash ro proper

1359
00:58:08,789 --> 00:58:14,519
fresh frozen like like slow spin first

1360
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:15,840
wash don't don't spin for 15 minutes and

1361
00:58:14,519 --> 00:58:18,389
give me that 90 because I'm not gonna

1362
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:20,730
like that over dry suit but some nice

1363
00:58:18,389 --> 00:58:23,129
like dripping to water is good but when

1364
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:26,190
people start making water hash and they

1365
00:58:23,130 --> 00:58:27,630
use tap water or some filtered water and

1366
00:58:26,190 --> 00:58:29,670
then there's like some some of that hard

1367
00:58:27,630 --> 00:58:32,640
water taste no matter how good the resin

1368
00:58:29,670 --> 00:58:34,500
is how about some fluoridated ice yeah

1369
00:58:32,639 --> 00:58:36,779
like all that stuff I could taste that

1370
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:39,300
stuff because I've taste pier resin when

1371
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:41,310
I make dry sift and what I'm trying to

1372
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:43,190
do is I can enhance that terpene with

1373
00:58:41,309 --> 00:58:46,380
the fresh frozen terpenes but not add

1374
00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:48,570
calcium and magnesium and all that other

1375
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:51,349
weird [ __ ] from like not good source

1376
00:58:48,570 --> 00:58:56,130
water or ice so water house you know it

1377
00:58:51,349 --> 00:59:06,809
it all depends on who's making it beside

1378
00:58:56,130 --> 00:59:09,480
only he likes the bubbles that's Sam

1379
00:59:06,809 --> 00:59:11,369
stuff I tried to sneak some fiji bubble

1380
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:17,250
some fiji water bubble and he was not

1381
00:59:11,369 --> 00:59:21,929
having it carbonation you know just co2

1382
00:59:17,250 --> 00:59:23,909
water you know where it pops and and

1383
00:59:21,929 --> 00:59:26,849
gets on your face when you're dabbing it

1384
00:59:23,909 --> 00:59:28,559
it's just like popping and shake off

1385
00:59:26,849 --> 00:59:30,569
those bulbous heads on the plat matter

1386
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:32,699

01:00:19,570 --> 01:00:23,800
foot in the corporate world but we're

1405
01:00:20,860 --> 01:00:26,130
also very much dragonfly earth medicine

1406
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:29,740
people and we like to grow the medicine

1407
01:00:26,130 --> 01:00:31,690
definitely cultivation is our main thing

1408
01:00:29,739 --> 01:00:34,089
you know the to us that's the beginning

1409
01:00:31,690 --> 01:00:36,429
you know we like we like home births and

1410
01:00:34,090 --> 01:00:39,640
natural births for human beings as well

1411
01:00:36,429 --> 01:00:41,889
and we also really like you know natural

1412
01:00:39,639 --> 01:00:43,900
cultivation and you know pure

1413
01:00:41,889 --> 01:00:45,369
cultivation it's really important to us

1414
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:46,930
we were just shouting out the hash

1415
01:00:45,369 --> 01:00:48,909
makers then we were shouting out the

1416
01:00:46,929 --> 01:00:50,589
growers and then Sam of course and his

1417
01:00:48,909 --> 01:00:53,259
great wisdom was like hey what about

1418
01:00:50,590 --> 01:00:54,940
like the land race you know it's

1419
01:00:53,260 --> 01:00:56,620
stewards the people who have been like

1420
01:00:54,940 --> 01:00:58,480
and the seed collectors that went and

1421
01:00:56,619 --> 01:01:00,880
grabbed gathered these seeds like whoo

1422
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:04,210
it definitely you can follow it way way

1423
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:07,809
way way back but I give props to all all

1424
01:01:04,210 --> 01:01:10,480
of the aspects of cannabis space

1425
01:01:07,809 --> 01:01:11,500
brothers who brought the seeds to go

1426
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:14,170
maverick

1427
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:15,969
ah yes the space brothers he came down

1428
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:17,500
where were they from Sirius B or

1429
01:01:15,969 --> 01:01:19,899
something like that or was that the

1430
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:24,639
dolphin people we just lost two hundred

1431
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:30,070
people mark marks Aldo is going to gonna

1432
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:33,190
comment on that take myself off mute but

1433
01:01:30,070 --> 01:01:35,289
I don't have anything I love that you're

1434
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:37,570
this you know analytical chemist mind

1435
01:01:35,289 --> 01:01:39,519
but you're like super trippy fish dude

1436
01:01:37,570 --> 01:01:42,700
as well you must just hear some great

1437
01:01:39,519 --> 01:01:44,949
things at these fishes mmm

1438
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:47,799
blame it on Garcia man it was all

1439
01:01:44,949 --> 01:01:51,759
because I was spun out kid on dead tour

1440
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:53,740
in the eighties you know following just

1441
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:55,480
being passionate you know that's what

1442
01:01:53,739 --> 01:01:58,119
Jerry Garcia teaches us is to be

1443
01:01:55,480 --> 01:02:00,960
passionate and what we do and to

1444
01:01:58,119 --> 01:02:04,900
understand everything that's happened

1445
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:06,639
before you you know you really have to

1446
01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:07,720
have an appreciate just like music and

1447
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:09,339
science you have to have a

1448
01:02:07,719 --> 01:02:12,779
appreciation of everything that's

1449
01:02:09,340 --> 01:02:15,280
happened before you to be able to

1450
01:02:12,780 --> 01:02:17,830
internalize it and then do something new

1451
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:19,990
well that's where that's where humility

1452
01:02:17,829 --> 01:02:23,019
comes in humility comes into play

1453
01:02:19,989 --> 01:02:26,199
because you have to be humble to accept

1454
01:02:23,019 --> 01:02:31,659
those things you've got I think that's

1455
01:02:26,199 --> 01:02:33,009
one of my best qualities but uh but I

1456
01:02:31,659 --> 01:02:35,079
think the other thing that you have to

1457
01:02:33,010 --> 01:02:38,050
really do is you have to really figure

1458
01:02:35,079 --> 01:02:40,059
that the best way you can learn is just

1459
01:02:38,050 --> 01:02:44,800
keep the channels of communication open

1460
01:02:40,059 --> 01:02:47,259
so even like ass church or the chat chat

1461
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:49,780
room is just I think the best thing

1462
01:02:47,260 --> 01:02:52,210
about having a hashed Church is waking

1463
01:02:49,780 --> 01:02:55,920
up to know that this whole group of

1464
01:02:52,210 --> 01:02:59,139
people even before the program starts is

1465
01:02:55,920 --> 01:03:00,579
in the room you know and I can tell you

1466
01:02:59,139 --> 01:03:02,949
exactly who they are they're like the

1467
01:03:00,579 --> 01:03:05,380
same 50 people they're there every time

1468
01:03:02,949 --> 01:03:07,509
right so as soon as you bless us with

1469
01:03:05,380 --> 01:03:10,150
the idea of hey we're gonna have an

1470
01:03:07,510 --> 01:03:12,190
episode this week there's already like a

1471
01:03:10,150 --> 01:03:13,900
cosmic gathering kind of like the way

1472
01:03:12,190 --> 01:03:16,358
there used to be at a Grateful Dead show

1473
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:20,320
people just knew they sweet would come

1474
01:03:16,358 --> 01:03:21,819
because it was there it's definitely a

1475
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:24,010
pretty cool way of looking at it and

1476
01:03:21,820 --> 01:03:26,588
definitely a big shout out to the core

1477
01:03:24,010 --> 01:03:30,070
group the 70s Mamas and the bingo long

1478
01:03:26,588 --> 01:03:32,440
bar T's tastebud for 20s they just yeah

1479
01:03:30,070 --> 01:03:35,109
he just said taste put for 20 we never

1480
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:37,690
leave mark if I set up the chat room on

1481
01:03:35,108 --> 01:03:40,569
unlike Monday tomorrow for next week

1482
01:03:37,690 --> 01:03:42,789
there there will be like a big chunk of

1483
01:03:40,570 --> 01:03:45,099
them in there for the whole week which

1484
01:03:42,789 --> 01:03:47,889
is great I mean you know what it's this

1485
01:03:45,099 --> 01:03:50,289
it's this passing around of ideas that

1486
01:03:47,889 --> 01:03:52,029
open dialog and you get a lot of people

1487
01:03:50,289 --> 01:03:54,159
in the fear and sparsity world in that

1488
01:03:52,030 --> 01:03:55,720
corporate greed of like oh I got it I

1489
01:03:54,159 --> 01:03:57,819
got to make sure it's kind of musical

1490
01:03:55,719 --> 01:04:00,129
chairs but with a ball and it's dialogue

1491
01:03:57,820 --> 01:04:01,809
and it's the the ball is the logos it's

1492
01:04:00,130 --> 01:04:04,119
the language and we pass that ball

1493
01:04:01,809 --> 01:04:05,799
around and sometimes it lands on someone

1494
01:04:04,119 --> 01:04:08,410
and it cracks open and that's the timing

1495
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:09,910
and so many people are afraid of that

1496
01:04:08,409 --> 01:04:11,920
that it's not going to land on them

1497
01:04:09,909 --> 01:04:14,409
they've just locked it up they're not

1498
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:16,059
sharing anything and they don't they're

1499
01:04:14,409 --> 01:04:18,309
not really active in the dialogue and

1500
01:04:16,059 --> 01:04:20,440
this is sort of a problem I'm sure in

1501
01:04:18,309 --> 01:04:21,269
many aspects of life but definitely in

1502
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:23,309
the cannabis

1503
01:04:21,269 --> 01:04:25,679
industry it's a big problem that people

1504
01:04:23,309 --> 01:04:29,610
are just afraid to see those great ideas

1505
01:04:25,679 --> 01:04:32,339
go around land on someone and then have

1506
01:04:29,610 --> 01:04:32,849
it blow up for them I'm I'm down with

1507
01:04:32,340 --> 01:04:34,829
that

1508
01:04:32,849 --> 01:04:38,159
I'm good with whoever it lands on as

1509
01:04:34,829 --> 01:04:45,989
long as we keep the dialogue going what

1510
01:04:38,159 --> 01:04:54,960
do you say there Johnny be making some

1511
01:04:45,989 --> 01:04:57,569
sift excellent getting it done Johnny

1512
01:04:54,960 --> 01:05:00,210
B's getting it done I always have to do

1513
01:04:57,570 --> 01:05:02,820
that you know I'm hoping that solvent

1514
01:05:00,210 --> 01:05:06,240
less wine comes in today I did pass him

1515
01:05:02,820 --> 01:05:08,400
the link and he was gonna come in today

1516
01:05:06,239 --> 01:05:09,869
while he washed some bubble so we could

1517
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:11,309
have I think every hashed Church there

1518
01:05:09,869 --> 01:05:24,949
should be some hash making that just

1519
01:05:11,309 --> 01:05:27,929
seems like like a good idea so my old oh

1520
01:05:24,949 --> 01:05:29,689
nice nice in here it's nice and chilly

1521
01:05:27,929 --> 01:05:33,149
about the microscope sitting right here

1522
01:05:29,690 --> 01:05:34,829
and I get to play beautiful and you're

1523
01:05:33,150 --> 01:05:36,930
all whited out in the white room you're

1524
01:05:34,829 --> 01:05:38,759
in the white room I'm in the white room

1525
01:05:36,929 --> 01:05:40,889
though it's a nicer room to be in plus

1526
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:42,690
I'm in it's uh it's quieter in here I

1527
01:05:40,889 --> 01:05:44,969
don't have the headphones on that could

1528
01:05:42,690 --> 01:05:46,920
work in a commute yeah I wonder if

1529
01:05:44,969 --> 01:05:51,329
that's what Eric Clapton was singing

1530
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:52,920
about in the white room well one thing

1531
01:05:51,329 --> 01:05:54,179
I've seen with all of these labs that

1532
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:55,710
were seeing they're all white they're

1533
01:05:54,179 --> 01:05:57,000
all nice and clean at least with white

1534
01:05:55,710 --> 01:05:58,500
he could see if there's any dirt or

1535
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:00,869
anything on the walls or anything like

1536
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:07,650
that so and it was easy to build this

1537
01:06:00,869 --> 01:06:09,809
was beginning this was my house room

1538
01:06:07,650 --> 01:06:11,880
before I was gonna live on a yoga studio

1539
01:06:09,809 --> 01:06:14,159
and make it a hot cold room but instead

1540
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:17,250
I taught myself a nice little house room

1541
01:06:14,159 --> 01:06:19,199
because I'm making hash you're gonna

1542
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:25,280
like bingo Lombardi's quote Johnny

1543
01:06:19,199 --> 01:06:25,279
Johnny B with the bangin still cheers I

1544
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:31,739
mean not my brush I got my cars

1545
01:06:29,309 --> 01:06:32,820
I got all my little chicks and

1546
01:06:31,739 --> 01:06:34,079
everything else that you guys have

1547
01:06:32,820 --> 01:06:36,390
showed me what I've learned

1548
01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:37,860
the years from from you and everybody

1549
01:06:36,389 --> 01:06:39,569
else of the industry that it showed me

1550
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:41,090
so much it's pretty cool to see how

1551
01:06:39,570 --> 01:06:46,350
things are going at what you're doing

1552
01:06:41,090 --> 01:06:47,970
dude on a huge scale we talked I was

1553
01:06:46,349 --> 01:06:49,920
talking with some people some help

1554
01:06:47,969 --> 01:06:52,199
farmers on what's going on in Manitoba

1555
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:53,760
that's some pretty crazy stuff how they

1556
01:06:52,199 --> 01:06:55,079
will start separating everything from

1557
01:06:53,760 --> 01:07:00,200
the fields down so they can now have

1558
01:06:55,079 --> 01:07:02,309
those try cones from the plants yes

1559
01:07:00,199 --> 01:07:03,899
pretty amazing what they're doing out

1560
01:07:02,309 --> 01:07:05,400
there they got a whole collective so

1561
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:07,170
they're getting all the farmers from all

1562
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:08,910
the hem fields are coming out all in and

1563
01:07:07,170 --> 01:07:10,349
they do like thinking basic to a

1564
01:07:08,909 --> 01:07:12,719
processing plant like what you're doing

1565
01:07:10,349 --> 01:07:14,759
I think it's pretty cool they needed

1566
01:07:12,719 --> 01:07:16,259
this on an industrial scale and I think

1567
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:19,200
it's the next level of this whole

1568
01:07:16,260 --> 01:07:21,000
industry is being able to we're gonna

1569
01:07:19,199 --> 01:07:26,009
beat up we're gonna be that processing

1570
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:30,710
plant or at least none of them know

1571
01:07:26,010 --> 01:07:36,140
remember the first time I was in

1572
01:07:30,710 --> 01:07:36,139
California in Central Valley and

1573
01:07:36,230 --> 01:07:44,340
California excuse me and I saw them

1574
01:07:39,679 --> 01:07:48,210
pulling a harvesting machine and there

1575
01:07:44,340 --> 01:07:52,550
was maybe 12 people singing in a row as

1576
01:07:48,210 --> 01:07:57,480
it pulled through the roads of beans and

1577
01:07:52,550 --> 01:08:00,920
the people that were doing the work were

1578
01:07:57,480 --> 01:08:03,750
walking in front of this machine and

1579
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:06,030
they would feed it into the machine

1580
01:08:03,750 --> 01:08:08,099
everything that they were making from

1581
01:08:06,030 --> 01:08:10,410
the beads right backs and I don't think

1582
01:08:08,099 --> 01:08:13,679
there was people walking and thankfully

1583
01:08:10,409 --> 01:08:17,760
machines was pulling the beans awkward

1584
01:08:13,679 --> 01:08:20,430
the bean plant and then beating them to

1585
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:24,180
people who were sitting in rows and they

1586
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:28,170
were boxing it and then the boxes would

1587
01:08:24,180 --> 01:08:31,260
be quick frozen not quick frozen but

1588
01:08:28,170 --> 01:08:36,270
quick chilled and then they were being

1589
01:08:31,260 --> 01:08:39,780
sent to retailers and the wholesalers

1590
01:08:36,270 --> 01:08:42,630
all across the nation but that will be

1591
01:08:39,779 --> 01:08:45,659
the future with cannabis it will be it

1592
01:08:42,630 --> 01:08:47,130
in the field and quick chill in the

1593
01:08:45,659 --> 01:08:51,059
frozen

1594
01:08:47,130 --> 01:08:53,119
and then central processing plant yeah

1595
01:08:51,060 --> 01:09:02,400
you'll be the other end there mark

1596
01:08:53,119 --> 01:09:04,889
grabbing it with a smile on my face the

1597
01:09:02,399 --> 01:09:07,349
dream come true so where are you guys at

1598
01:09:04,889 --> 01:09:09,230
Josh and Kelly what are you guys where

1599
01:09:07,350 --> 01:09:12,900
you guys at

1600
01:09:09,229 --> 01:09:14,818
we're in Spokane right now um often we

1601
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:17,579
come down here but where we're at right

1602
01:09:14,819 --> 01:09:20,190
now as far as the industry goes and you

1603
01:09:17,579 --> 01:09:22,979
know we're just everyday everyday in the

1604
01:09:20,189 --> 01:09:25,318
soil everyday in the greenhouses every

1605
01:09:22,979 --> 01:09:26,669
day in our breeding rooms you know same

1606
01:09:25,319 --> 01:09:29,730
thing that we've been doing for the past

1607
01:09:26,670 --> 01:09:31,529
26 years and you know although the

1608
01:09:29,729 --> 01:09:33,178
industry is changing and there's a lot

1609
01:09:31,529 --> 01:09:35,190
of things that are happening it's still

1610
01:09:33,179 --> 01:09:37,588
like we have to keep our focus and what

1611
01:09:35,189 --> 01:09:40,108
it is that we came here for and how we

1612
01:09:37,588 --> 01:09:41,789
brought this forward so it's important

1613
01:09:40,109 --> 01:09:45,600
you know we're keeping our focus on the

1614
01:09:41,789 --> 01:09:47,850
farm and there's a lot of you know bombs

1615
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:49,560
going off everywhere and lots of people

1616
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:51,509
giving us offers and all this kind of

1617
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:53,609
stuff but we're just really keeping our

1618
01:09:51,509 --> 01:09:55,109
head down and and really playing the

1619
01:09:53,609 --> 01:09:56,789
game of humility because we feel like

1620
01:09:55,109 --> 01:09:58,189
it's really important and that's what we

1621
01:09:56,789 --> 01:10:00,569
need to show the plant every day

1622
01:09:58,189 --> 01:10:04,289
humility and we also see that the world

1623
01:10:00,569 --> 01:10:07,289
is in a clean cannabis shortage you know

1624
01:10:04,289 --> 01:10:10,019
we find that you know that you know the

1625
01:10:07,289 --> 01:10:12,719
cultivation you know needs to be really

1626
01:10:10,020 --> 01:10:14,790
thought out in order to be like as clean

1627
01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:16,500
as it as we all wanted to be in stuff so

1628
01:10:14,789 --> 01:10:18,719
that's a big part of our work and and

1629
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:20,429
and certification that we created and

1630
01:10:18,719 --> 01:10:22,020
working with other ones you know that

1631
01:10:20,429 --> 01:10:24,539
are being created too that are outside

1632
01:10:22,020 --> 01:10:27,810
of ours and so we're just working really

1633
01:10:24,539 --> 01:10:29,819
diligently on clean cultivation and yeah

1634
01:10:27,810 --> 01:10:31,020
we always free up our education you know

1635
01:10:29,819 --> 01:10:33,119
we were talking about passing

1636
01:10:31,020 --> 01:10:35,820
information around and it's actually

1637
01:10:33,119 --> 01:10:38,969
very rare for humans to have original

1638
01:10:35,819 --> 01:10:41,399
thought you know humanity doesn't come

1639
01:10:38,969 --> 01:10:43,079
up with original thought too often but

1640
01:10:41,399 --> 01:10:45,179
if we can have good thoughts that we

1641
01:10:43,079 --> 01:10:46,260
pass around easily and freely then

1642
01:10:45,179 --> 01:10:48,239
that's the way that we're gonna be able

1643
01:10:46,260 --> 01:10:51,600
to bring up the whole race of humanity

1644
01:10:48,238 --> 01:10:53,549
yeah and um you know Bob Snodgrass told

1645
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:55,530
us a really great story one time which

1646
01:10:53,550 --> 01:10:57,810
you know he's such an amazing person and

1647
01:10:55,529 --> 01:11:01,019
everything that he's done for glass and

1648
01:10:57,810 --> 01:11:02,550
everything over the years as his algebra

1649
01:11:01,020 --> 01:11:05,400
teacher in high school taught him about

1650
01:11:02,550 --> 01:11:08,070
the bell curve with knowledge that

1651
01:11:05,399 --> 01:11:10,170
humans you know I'll know a certain

1652
01:11:08,069 --> 01:11:12,899
amount of thick knowledge and they're in

1653
01:11:10,170 --> 01:11:15,510
there rising up but they're the the

1654
01:11:12,899 --> 01:11:18,479
curve is more flat but once everyone

1655
01:11:15,510 --> 01:11:21,420
starts sharing information the the

1656
01:11:18,479 --> 01:11:23,369
knowledge goes up really sharply and our

1657
01:11:21,420 --> 01:11:25,380
humanity you know and our and our

1658
01:11:23,369 --> 01:11:26,880
abilities to do things you know gets

1659
01:11:25,380 --> 01:11:29,550
much greater because we're sharing

1660
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:32,340
information and that's really why we

1661
01:11:29,550 --> 01:11:33,840
evolve you know more as a race when

1662
01:11:32,340 --> 01:11:35,760
we're sharing things with each other and

1663
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:38,850
we feel like that's that's what we want

1664
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:40,320
to be a part of absolutely should I

1665
01:11:38,850 --> 01:11:42,090
should hook you guys up with my quest

1666
01:11:40,319 --> 01:11:43,920
while you're out in Spokane he just left

1667
01:11:42,090 --> 01:11:48,000
the chatroom but he's I'm pretty sure in

1668
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:50,060
Spokane yeah we love it that'd be great

1669
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:52,350
we're here

1670
01:11:50,060 --> 01:11:57,770

1672
01:11:57,770 --> 01:12:03,410
thumbs up from Wade yeah I'm doing good

1673
01:12:01,619 --> 01:12:06,420
actually

1674
01:12:03,409 --> 01:12:12,329
it's the weather's cooled off a little

1675
01:12:06,420 --> 01:12:17,069
bit here and the big news in our world

1676
01:12:12,329 --> 01:12:20,340
at the moment is is mixed on the plus

1677
01:12:17,069 --> 01:12:22,039
side the California Legislature passed a

1678
01:12:20,340 --> 01:12:25,860
bunch of bills yesterday was their last

1679
01:12:22,039 --> 01:12:28,699
day or Friday was the last day of the

1680
01:12:25,859 --> 01:12:32,639
legislative session for this year and

1681
01:12:28,699 --> 01:12:35,579
Senate bill 829 which we've been pushing

1682
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:38,280
pretty hard for passed out of the

1683
01:12:35,579 --> 01:12:40,710
assembly and the Senate and has gone to

1684
01:12:38,279 --> 01:12:42,809
the governor for a signature and there

1685
01:12:40,710 --> 01:12:47,489
were enough yes boats that if he vetoes

1686
01:12:42,810 --> 01:12:50,789
it it will go into a law anyway there

1687
01:12:47,489 --> 01:12:54,779
were I think two or three out of sixty

1688
01:12:50,789 --> 01:12:56,550
some in the assembly and two in the

1689
01:12:54,779 --> 01:13:00,420
Senate who voted no and everyone else

1690
01:12:56,550 --> 01:13:06,420
voted yes and it allows compassionate

1691
01:13:00,420 --> 01:13:09,000
use licensing and not really sure it's

1692
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:11,199
like any law how the regulations play

1693
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:13,719
out is going to have a huge

1694
01:13:11,198 --> 01:13:16,149
impact on how it actually works but

1695
01:13:13,719 --> 01:13:17,979
there's great enthusiasm for it among

1696
01:13:16,149 --> 01:13:20,768
the regulator's they recognize that

1697
01:13:17,979 --> 01:13:24,789
legitimate medical need that's not

1698
01:13:20,769 --> 01:13:27,760
always based on ability to pay is a real

1699
01:13:24,788 --> 01:13:29,408
thing and the model in California for a

1700
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:31,570
long time has been about giving it away

1701
01:13:29,408 --> 01:13:34,719
to people who need it

1702
01:13:31,569 --> 01:13:39,670
WAM was one of the first entities I knew

1703
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:40,868
of doing that kind of work and yeah

1704
01:13:39,670 --> 01:13:43,359
there were a number of other bills

1705
01:13:40,868 --> 01:13:46,420
defining premesis and whatnot anyway the

1706
01:13:43,359 --> 01:13:47,828
the state is trying its best to sort out

1707
01:13:46,420 --> 01:13:50,559
all the problems that have come with

1708
01:13:47,828 --> 01:13:55,658
regulation in California

1709
01:13:50,559 --> 01:14:00,099
on the downside some of the kids in the

1710
01:13:55,658 --> 01:14:03,759
network the kids with epilepsy including

1711
01:14:00,099 --> 01:14:07,119
Silas Forest son are dealing with a lot

1712
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:12,579
of seizures right now Silas had a series

1713
01:14:07,118 --> 01:14:14,170
of grand Mal's night before last and

1714
01:14:12,578 --> 01:14:16,599
it's not just Silas it's a number of

1715
01:14:14,170 --> 01:14:19,828
other kids in the network so I don't

1716
01:14:16,599 --> 01:14:22,449
know what's going on in the in the world

1717
01:14:19,828 --> 01:14:24,788
other than the insanity that is going on

1718
01:14:22,448 --> 01:14:29,589
in the world that's affecting these kids

1719
01:14:24,788 --> 01:14:34,658
but yeah how are the fires there how's

1720
01:14:29,590 --> 01:14:38,769
the smoke the the smoke has been good in

1721
01:14:34,658 --> 01:14:41,379
our area several of the big fires are

1722
01:14:38,769 --> 01:14:44,019
mostly contained the one that was

1723
01:14:41,380 --> 01:14:46,420
happening down in southern Mendocino in

1724
01:14:44,019 --> 01:14:48,940
Lake County they're pretty much

1725
01:14:46,420 --> 01:14:50,889
contained it but it's it's like a

1726
01:14:48,939 --> 01:14:53,529
hundred and some thousand acres the

1727
01:14:50,889 --> 01:14:57,328
biggest fire California's ever had and

1728
01:14:53,529 --> 01:15:00,728
it's still early in the fire season so

1729
01:14:57,328 --> 01:15:02,498
we're all kind of holding our breath I

1730
01:15:00,729 --> 01:15:04,440
wonder if that could be a part of it

1731
01:15:02,498 --> 01:15:07,090
though you know maybe it's not affecting

1732
01:15:04,439 --> 01:15:08,948
you know most people but people there's

1733
01:15:07,090 --> 01:15:11,288
people that are sensitive like that you

1734
01:15:08,948 --> 01:15:13,478
know with with seizures and whatnot any

1735
01:15:11,288 --> 01:15:16,359
little stress on their system can cause

1736
01:15:13,479 --> 01:15:17,530
that to to fire yeah that would make

1737
01:15:16,359 --> 01:15:21,609
perfect sense

1738
01:15:17,529 --> 01:15:24,009
the we humans are uniquely sensitive to

1739
01:15:21,609 --> 01:15:25,029
our environments we were very capable of

1740
01:15:24,010 --> 01:15:27,849
dealing with all kinds of

1741
01:15:25,029 --> 01:15:31,359
craziness unless we have compromises in

1742
01:15:27,849 --> 01:15:33,190
our well-being in other areas and you

1743
01:15:31,359 --> 01:15:34,750
know we were doing shoutouts earlier to

1744
01:15:33,189 --> 01:15:35,408
all the people that have helped the

1745
01:15:34,750 --> 01:15:38,469
plant

1746
01:15:35,408 --> 01:15:42,488
I wanted to pipe up and give a shout out

1747
01:15:38,469 --> 01:15:44,288
to the plant herself for surviving all

1748
01:15:42,488 --> 01:15:47,198
this prohibition that's been going on

1749
01:15:44,288 --> 01:15:50,939
and give thanks to all the humans who

1750
01:15:47,198 --> 01:15:53,198
have worked with her to see this amazing

1751
01:15:50,939 --> 01:15:56,169
unveiling of what's possible with this

1752
01:15:53,198 --> 01:15:58,089
plant I just feel like with all the

1753
01:15:56,170 --> 01:16:00,130
craziness that's going on in the world I

1754
01:15:58,090 --> 01:16:03,489
mean my whole life I've been dreaming

1755
01:16:00,130 --> 01:16:05,170
about as the rust is used to say the

1756
01:16:03,488 --> 01:16:08,799
herb is the healing of the people and

1757
01:16:05,170 --> 01:16:11,050
it's actually happening now and give

1758
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:15,159
thanks for all of us and all of those

1759
01:16:11,050 --> 01:16:19,050
who have come before us and to the plant

1760
01:16:15,158 --> 01:16:25,569
the amazing beautiful cannabis linnaeus

1761
01:16:19,050 --> 01:16:29,529
sativa indica ruderalis etc that yeah

1762
01:16:25,569 --> 01:16:33,549
this plant takes water soil and light

1763
01:16:29,529 --> 01:16:37,750
and turns it into oil that's a pretty

1764
01:16:33,550 --> 01:16:40,480
trippy thing it's I just give I feel

1765
01:16:37,750 --> 01:16:43,300
deep deep deep gratitude for this plant

1766
01:16:40,479 --> 01:16:45,459
and it's part in my life and for what

1767
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:46,779
I've seen it can do for other people so

1768
01:16:45,460 --> 01:16:47,590
that's kind of where Wade's at at the

1769
01:16:46,779 --> 01:16:50,469
moment

1770
01:16:47,590 --> 01:16:53,440
much love to all of you I'm hanging out

1771
01:16:50,469 --> 01:16:56,349

our again we looked in California and we

1801
01:18:17,948 --> 01:18:23,859
just keep coming back to Colorado yeah

1802
01:18:21,899 --> 01:18:27,158
well it seems like you're not the only

1803
01:18:23,859 --> 01:18:29,649
ones that's for sure Colorado seems to

1804
01:18:27,158 --> 01:18:31,329
have a growth going on with people

1805
01:18:29,649 --> 01:18:33,369
interested in the cannabis it seems like

1806
01:18:31,329 --> 01:18:36,670
out of all the states it has some pretty

1807
01:18:33,369 --> 01:18:38,198
decent right that's a mature market it's

1808
01:18:36,670 --> 01:18:40,060
a mature market especially for

1809
01:18:38,198 --> 01:18:43,750
connoisseur products like I think what

1810
01:18:40,060 --> 01:18:46,330
you see now very prevalent in the stores

1811
01:18:43,750 --> 01:18:51,369
I was in rare dankness yesterday and got

1812
01:18:46,329 --> 01:18:53,619
some got some live resin but um yeah no

1813
01:18:51,369 --> 01:18:55,500
slabs not you know you know really see

list but a lot of diamonds and sauce

1817
01:19:02,170 --> 01:19:06,639

1818
01:19:04,238 --> 01:19:08,529

01:19:14,408 --> 01:19:19,719
instagrams kind of trippy how it directs

1824
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:25,289
the popularity of what people are going

1825
01:19:19,719 --> 01:19:27,300
to produce that in the fact that

1826

tasty and sweet and gets you super

1827
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:34,739

mother lovers thank you very much

1836
01:20:11,090 --> 01:20:21,630
sifting there you go I was gonna say

1837
01:20:19,050 --> 01:20:24,239
that you know it would be nice to see a

1838
01:20:21,630 --> 01:20:26,460
lot more organic cultivation in Colorado

1839
01:20:24,239 --> 01:20:28,679
that's the one thing that is a little

1840
01:20:26,460 --> 01:20:31,680
they're a little light on the organic

1841
01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:34,800
cultivation so I'd love to see that that

1842
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:38,369
that community get a lot more charge out

1843
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:40,020
there I think that's a good thing always

1844
01:20:38,369 --> 01:20:42,149
you know that's one of the things I love

1845
01:20:40,020 --> 01:20:44,580
about Whistler Pemberton the Whistler

1846
01:20:42,149 --> 01:20:46,349
Medical they grow organically they're

1847
01:20:44,579 --> 01:20:49,260
you know one of the few that are pumping

1848
01:20:46,350 --> 01:20:50,820
out the OGIS and it's it's just nice to

1849
01:20:49,260 --> 01:20:53,369
be around it's nice to be in rooms that

1850
01:20:50,819 --> 01:20:54,989
are that's like made like soil you know

1851
01:20:53,369 --> 01:20:58,109
not that I'm like dissing on on the

1852
01:20:54,989 --> 01:21:00,869
other options or whatnot but I will also

1853
01:20:58,109 --> 01:21:03,539
say that generally I don't know exactly

1854
01:21:00,869 --> 01:21:06,059
what the noticeable difference is in the

1855
01:21:03,539 --> 01:21:09,689
actual resin gland I'm not sure how much

1856
01:21:06,060 --> 01:21:13,080
of that is absorbing like pesticides or

1857
01:21:09,689 --> 01:21:15,599
foliar sprays or whatnot but definitely

1858
01:21:13,079 --> 01:21:17,550
I could say that material like that was

1859
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:19,440
grown outdoor organically but not

1860
01:21:17,550 --> 01:21:20,369
flushed and just had like the darkest

1861
01:21:19,439 --> 01:21:23,069
ash ever

1862
01:21:20,369 --> 01:21:25,260
I made hash from it and it was just like

1863
01:21:23,069 --> 01:21:27,539
I smoked it and loved it it was sweet

1864
01:21:25,260 --> 01:21:28,770
skunk and I remember people just

1865
01:21:27,539 --> 01:21:30,060
complaining they were like oh you got

1866
01:21:28,770 --> 01:21:31,650
that sweet skunk I'm like yeah it was

1867
01:21:30,060 --> 01:21:33,840
great and they were like really I was

1868
01:21:31,649 --> 01:21:35,219
kind of disappointed and I'm like well

1869
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:36,720
that's weird and it took me a while to

1870
01:21:35,220 --> 01:21:39,000
figure out that they were all smoking

1871
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:42,570
the flower and the ash was burning super

1872
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:45,149
dark and I was smoking the hash and that

1873
01:21:42,569 --> 01:21:48,479
leaving the food and the plant didn't

1874
01:21:45,149 --> 01:21:50,219
affect the resin really at all what do

1875
01:21:48,479 --> 01:21:52,409
you guys have to say about that oh well

1876
01:21:50,220 --> 01:21:55,500
there's a number of cases where the

1877
01:21:52,409 --> 01:21:57,359
resin glands you suck up pesticides and

1878
01:21:55,500 --> 01:22:00,149
failed tests so there's there's got ants

1879
01:21:57,359 --> 01:22:02,519
giant list farms that you know would

1880
01:22:00,149 --> 01:22:05,399
really disagree with that that statement

1881
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:08,610
however if they're at resin glands are

1882
01:22:05,399 --> 01:22:11,579
clean and nice and they could be really

1883
01:22:08,609 --> 01:22:14,880
similar I guess our biggest mission in

1884
01:22:11,579 --> 01:22:18,329
life is to show that the cultivation of

1885
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:21,829
the resin to begin with um there's so

1886
01:22:18,329 --> 01:22:28,199
much waste that goes into cultivating

1887
01:22:21,829 --> 01:22:30,059
flowers and there's so much energy use

1888
01:22:28,199 --> 01:22:32,309
that goes into it that you really if you

1889
01:22:30,060 --> 01:22:34,080
want to factor in all of the carbon

1890
01:22:32,310 --> 01:22:36,120
footprint that goes with it or the trash

1891
01:22:34,079 --> 01:22:38,130
crit rate you know you'd have to be

1892
01:22:36,119 --> 01:22:39,689
really concerned so that that's what

1893
01:22:38,130 --> 01:22:41,310
we're at you know I mean it's it's the

1894
01:22:39,689 --> 01:22:43,769
the amount of like every single time you

1895
01:22:41,310 --> 01:22:46,710
throw something out of those large-scale

1896
01:22:43,770 --> 01:22:48,390
operations out of out of rock wall you

1897
01:22:46,710 --> 01:22:50,310
have to throw all that away and say I

1898
01:22:48,390 --> 01:22:56,039
mean it's you know on all the tubes it's

1899
01:22:50,310 --> 01:22:58,380
it's not it's you know there is so much

1900
01:22:56,039 --> 01:23:00,000
that we don't know about cannabis still

1901
01:22:58,380 --> 01:23:02,279
you know now we're just being able to

1902
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:04,710
get funding to be able to do the testing

1903
01:23:02,279 --> 01:23:06,539
and to be able to understand what it is

1904
01:23:04,710 --> 01:23:09,359
that we're looking for and I do believe

1905
01:23:06,539 --> 01:23:11,159
that you know I'm hoping that cannabis

1906
01:23:09,359 --> 01:23:13,559
will have the last laugh that it can't

1907
01:23:11,159 --> 01:23:15,449
be you know controlled in the same way

1908
01:23:13,560 --> 01:23:17,850
that tobacco has been controlled you

1909
01:23:15,449 --> 01:23:20,670
know tobacco was taken over the plants

1910
01:23:17,850 --> 01:23:22,590
totally in control and we you know it

1911
01:23:20,670 --> 01:23:24,899
was like the big corporations got ahold

1912
01:23:22,590 --> 01:23:26,730
of it and then no more real studies and

1913
01:23:24,899 --> 01:23:29,609
tests really came out of it after that

1914
01:23:26,729 --> 01:23:31,559
as far as organic cultivation and I feel

1915
01:23:29,609 --> 01:23:33,479
like you know maybe she will have the

1916
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:35,700
last laugh in that she produces a lot of

1917
01:23:33,479 --> 01:23:38,069
cabin cannabinoids and chirping and

1918
01:23:35,699 --> 01:23:40,229
things that she produces into herself

1919
01:23:38,069 --> 01:23:42,840
when she's really happy and in a soil

1920
01:23:40,229 --> 01:23:45,179
situation so and we also like believe in

1921
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:47,520
origins and we really resonate with like

1922
01:23:45,180 --> 01:23:49,470
Wade and and what he has to say big

1923
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:50,850
enough the plan and the origins of the

1924
01:23:49,470 --> 01:23:52,170
soil and the earth and

1925
01:23:50,850 --> 01:23:54,840
that and for us that's what we

1926
01:23:52,170 --> 01:23:56,909
recognized you know we recognized the

1927
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:59,430
naturalness and we recognized the plant

1928
01:23:56,909 --> 01:24:01,289
and its full potential so some of the

1929
01:23:59,430 --> 01:24:03,510
organic growers they need to maybe they

1930
01:24:01,289 --> 01:24:05,250
flush to make their ash look better for

1931
01:24:03,510 --> 01:24:07,590
people and stuff but in the end of the

1932
01:24:05,250 --> 01:24:10,680
day you know if they're doing a really

1933
01:24:07,590 --> 01:24:12,869
you know conscious grow and stuff you

1934
01:24:10,680 --> 01:24:14,310
know it does have to burn correctly for

1935
01:24:12,869 --> 01:24:16,859
the consumer and all that but you know

1936
01:24:14,310 --> 01:24:18,960
if it's bad for the earth but it smokes

1937
01:24:16,859 --> 01:24:21,630
well I just don't see that as a good

1938
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:22,289
okay no no I feel yeah absolutely I'm

1939
01:24:21,630 --> 01:24:23,850
definitely not

1940
01:24:22,289 --> 01:24:28,109
you know stoked on the use of pesticides

1941
01:24:23,850 --> 01:24:30,210
even though you know 99.9% of people eat

1942
01:24:28,109 --> 01:24:32,130
it on their food for almost every single

1943
01:24:30,210 --> 01:24:33,840
meal that they have as well as the

1944
01:24:32,130 --> 01:24:35,909
clothes that they wear as well as the

1945
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:38,220
vehicles that they drive as well as it's

1946
01:24:35,909 --> 01:24:40,949
just so saturated into our system I'm I

1947
01:24:38,220 --> 01:24:43,230
would love to see us get rid of as many

1948
01:24:40,949 --> 01:24:45,269
of these things as possible and create a

1949
01:24:43,229 --> 01:24:47,519
more sort of synergistic symbiotic

1950
01:24:45,270 --> 01:24:50,430
experience for the world it doesn't seem

1951
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:52,860
sustainable to say the least to continue

1952
01:24:50,430 --> 01:24:56,190
to poison everything on such a mass

1953
01:24:52,859 --> 01:24:58,439
scale that you know we cause pollution

1954
01:24:56,189 --> 01:25:01,559
and and and great disruptions in our

1955
01:24:58,439 --> 01:25:05,729
oceans and our nature cycles but it is

1956
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:09,750
what it is now we're such a reactionary

1957
01:25:05,729 --> 01:25:12,149
society you know in America we don't do

1958
01:25:09,750 --> 01:25:13,920
anything until we're not proactive we're

1959
01:25:12,149 --> 01:25:15,779
reactionary just like when you see a

1960
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:17,640
salmonella outbreak or any of those

1961
01:25:15,779 --> 01:25:19,259
things that go after the processor they

1962
01:25:17,640 --> 01:25:21,660
got through the farm but they don't

1963
01:25:19,260 --> 01:25:24,090
change the general overall problem like

1964
01:25:21,659 --> 01:25:26,819
in Japan there's no point zero zero

1965
01:25:24,090 --> 01:25:33,690
parts per million of any kind of fecal

1966
01:25:26,819 --> 01:25:34,170
or any microbial matter in an in South

1967
01:25:33,689 --> 01:25:38,279
Korea

1968
01:25:34,170 --> 01:25:41,880
there's 0.3 0.3 and 0.03 and then in

1969
01:25:38,279 --> 01:25:45,329
Europe it's 0.5 so but in America it's

1970
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:48,150
5,000 parts per million so we really

1971
01:25:45,329 --> 01:25:50,579
live in a super toxic since I've been

1972
01:25:48,149 --> 01:25:54,989
able to make money and turn a profit at

1973
01:25:50,579 --> 01:25:57,449
our expense so I believe that organics

1974
01:25:54,989 --> 01:25:59,840
is the only way to go the small farmer

1975
01:25:57,449 --> 01:26:02,939
we really have to work on see a

1976
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:04,409
homegrown homegrown really concerns me

1977
01:26:02,939 --> 01:26:04,710
they're gonna try to get rid of it and

1978
01:26:04,409 --> 01:26:06,689
every

1979
01:26:04,710 --> 01:26:09,239
State they've been successful here in

1980
01:26:06,689 --> 01:26:11,159
Washington and they've got the state

1981
01:26:09,238 --> 01:26:14,939
near you I mean without the home grow

1982
01:26:11,159 --> 01:26:17,609
and the small farmer you know and people

1983
01:26:14,939 --> 01:26:21,839
out there there's a lot of there's no

1984
01:26:17,609 --> 01:26:24,420
new thing such a massive scale I'd like

1985
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:26,670
to focus on smaller scale I've been

1986
01:26:24,420 --> 01:26:29,010
teaching a class at Clark College here

1987
01:26:26,670 --> 01:26:31,590
in Vancouver cannabis in your health and

1988
01:26:29,010 --> 01:26:34,739
then I do how growers do it it's a three

1989
01:26:31,590 --> 01:26:36,750
hour intensive on taking your plants to

1990
01:26:34,738 --> 01:26:38,399
harvest for highest yield and I really

1991
01:26:36,750 --> 01:26:40,529
love to show everybody the clean organic

1992
01:26:38,399 --> 01:26:42,629
route to go there's no reason we

1993
01:26:40,529 --> 01:26:45,509
shouldn't be taking that route it's

1994
01:26:42,630 --> 01:26:48,960
better for the environment you know and

1995
01:26:45,510 --> 01:26:51,480
and you got a bent Abdul tube thing and

1996
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:53,699
the mylar bags and how bad are those

1997
01:26:51,479 --> 01:26:55,679
they're choking out our oceans you can't

1998
01:26:53,699 --> 01:26:57,630
get rid of them I find him in my ditches

1999
01:26:55,680 --> 01:27:00,150
out here in the country I mean it's

2000
01:26:57,630 --> 01:27:02,279
really really really bad and you know as

2001
01:27:00,149 --> 01:27:04,379
cannabis and steward of the land we

2002
01:27:02,279 --> 01:27:07,590
really need to put our best foot forward

2003
01:27:04,380 --> 01:27:10,319
and I really believe the the growers who

2004
01:27:07,590 --> 01:27:11,819
care about and the processors who really

2005
01:27:10,319 --> 01:27:14,069
care about it are putting their sell

2006
01:27:11,819 --> 01:27:16,969
their product in glass jars and they're

2007
01:27:14,069 --> 01:27:20,460
using biodegradable packaging and I do

2008
01:27:16,969 --> 01:27:22,829
that is must if as we continue on or

2009
01:27:20,460 --> 01:27:25,380
we're just going to destroy planet Earth

2010
01:27:22,829 --> 01:27:26,880
even more that's true for sure you know

2011
01:27:25,380 --> 01:27:30,690
it's kind of that right there it's the

2012
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:33,060
quiver of access in the sense of we need

2013
01:27:30,689 --> 01:27:35,549
exactly what you're teaching that small

2014
01:27:33,060 --> 01:27:37,200
scale you know scalability where people

2015
01:27:35,550 --> 01:27:39,060
are doing it for themselves but it's

2016
01:27:37,199 --> 01:27:40,590
just never gonna happen for everyone

2017
01:27:39,060 --> 01:27:43,350
it's gonna be a percentage of people

2018
01:27:40,590 --> 01:27:45,779
that do it that way so then we also need

2019
01:27:43,350 --> 01:27:48,090
large scale and that can't be done in a

2020
01:27:45,779 --> 01:27:49,979
toxic level it has to be done in a way

2021
01:27:48,090 --> 01:27:52,380
that's like we're smart enough to figure

2022
01:27:49,979 --> 01:27:55,169
it out there's no reason why scalability

2023
01:27:52,380 --> 01:27:58,350
has to be a bad thing I just think it

2024
01:27:55,170 --> 01:27:59,760
should never phase out small scale small

2025
01:27:58,350 --> 01:28:01,380
scale should always have a place in the

2026
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:03,420
cannabis industry I always want to have

2027
01:28:01,380 --> 01:28:05,369
my own garden in the back I always want

2028
01:28:03,420 --> 01:28:08,069
to be able to process my own stuff a

2029
01:28:05,369 --> 01:28:10,649
variety of ways at home but at the same

2030
01:28:08,069 --> 01:28:13,049
time I know so many people out there who

2031
01:28:10,649 --> 01:28:14,609
that's never going to be the reality for

2032
01:28:13,050 --> 01:28:16,289
them ever just the way they don't raise

2033
01:28:14,609 --> 01:28:18,089
their own chickens to eat eggs every

2034
01:28:16,289 --> 01:28:18,420
morning just the way they don't make

2035
01:28:18,090 --> 01:28:21,150
their

2036
01:28:18,420 --> 01:28:24,060
clothes from there you know metal that

2037
01:28:21,149 --> 01:28:26,670
they grow in their backyard it's just

2038
01:28:24,060 --> 01:28:29,430
there's both both sides need to exist

2039
01:28:26,670 --> 01:28:31,649
and you know like people like my mom for

2040
01:28:29,430 --> 01:28:34,470
example like she is most comfortable

2041
01:28:31,649 --> 01:28:36,210
ordering her cannabis from a large-scale

2042
01:28:34,470 --> 01:28:38,070
facility it's just comfortable to her

2043
01:28:36,210 --> 01:28:39,689
she just goes online she gets it done

2044
01:28:38,069 --> 01:28:41,939
she feels good about it she's not

2045
01:28:39,689 --> 01:28:44,669
opposed to going into dispensaries but

2046
01:28:41,939 --> 01:28:46,649
she's worked for the police for 35 years

2047
01:28:44,670 --> 01:28:49,170
so the laws is a big part of it as well

2048
01:28:46,649 --> 01:28:50,969
but I just see both sides being fairly

2049
01:28:49,170 --> 01:28:53,550
valid as you know I'm sitting here going

2050
01:28:50,970 --> 01:28:55,320
I want to go as large as I can and Tom's

2051
01:28:53,550 --> 01:28:58,350
like I want to teach small-scale I

2052
01:28:55,319 --> 01:29:00,630
totally respect what you're saying but

2053
01:28:58,350 --> 01:29:02,430
think that that large scale has its

2054
01:29:00,630 --> 01:29:04,560
place as well to give people there's

2055
01:29:02,430 --> 01:29:06,510
room there's room for all of us we all

2056
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:09,240
have our space in this cannabis world

2057
01:29:06,510 --> 01:29:12,260
you know everybody has their own little

2058
01:29:09,239 --> 01:29:15,210
position and and and it takes all of us

2059
01:29:12,260 --> 01:29:17,340
to get this plan and to get this

2060
01:29:15,210 --> 01:29:19,140
industry in the right place where it's

2061
01:29:17,340 --> 01:29:22,319
it's actually benefitting people and

2062
01:29:19,140 --> 01:29:23,850
benefiting the planet that's definitely

2063
01:29:22,319 --> 01:29:26,489
that's definitely a big part of it

2064
01:29:23,850 --> 01:29:29,130
you know we want it to be more positive

2065
01:29:26,489 --> 01:29:31,679
and beneficial in that sense that there

2066
01:29:29,130 --> 01:29:33,029
are a lot of people just think of the

2067
01:29:31,680 --> 01:29:35,010
amount of pesticides that have been

2068
01:29:33,029 --> 01:29:36,929
sprayed on cannabis alone even in the

2069
01:29:35,010 --> 01:29:39,750
black market over the you know the last

2070
01:29:36,930 --> 01:29:43,050
four or five decades that's all that is

2071
01:29:39,750 --> 01:29:45,569
a lot of pesticides or even wine they

2072
01:29:43,050 --> 01:29:48,150
just did a case study on a hundred

2073
01:29:45,569 --> 01:29:49,649
different wines in California and this

2074
01:29:48,149 --> 01:29:51,869
is one thing that we're not testing for

2075
01:29:49,649 --> 01:29:54,299
in cannabis because you know which is

2076
01:29:51,869 --> 01:29:56,069
glyphosate and a hundred percent of

2077
01:29:54,300 --> 01:29:58,230
those tests came out with you know

2078
01:29:56,069 --> 01:30:00,179
really high levels of glyphosate that's

2079
01:29:58,229 --> 01:30:01,319
not part of our pesticide levels you

2080
01:30:00,180 --> 01:30:03,030
know when people go and bring their

2081
01:30:01,319 --> 01:30:04,829
cannabis and they're not testing for

2082
01:30:03,029 --> 01:30:06,630
glyphosate when you go and you bring

2083
01:30:04,829 --> 01:30:09,420
your soil sample and you have to pay

2084
01:30:06,630 --> 01:30:11,340
extra to get a glyphosate test and we

2085
01:30:09,420 --> 01:30:13,409
really encourage people to do glyphosate

2086
01:30:11,340 --> 01:30:15,360
tests because their amendments may be

2087
01:30:13,409 --> 01:30:17,849
Omri certified but they may be still

2088
01:30:15,359 --> 01:30:19,829
spraying glyphosate say on their alfalfa

2089
01:30:17,850 --> 01:30:21,840
that they can buy in bulk and if you

2090
01:30:19,829 --> 01:30:23,609
utilize that in large amounts on your

2091
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:26,550
soil then you're gonna start having

2092
01:30:23,609 --> 01:30:28,139
massive microbiology die offs which is

2093
01:30:26,550 --> 01:30:31,230
really huge and that's something that

2094
01:30:28,140 --> 01:30:32,700
then goes up into the flower so like you

2095
01:30:31,229 --> 01:30:35,609
see

2096
01:30:32,699 --> 01:30:38,369
what wouldn't glyphosate just peel the

2097
01:30:35,609 --> 01:30:41,039
plant no glyphosate doesn't kill the

2098
01:30:38,369 --> 01:30:43,920
plant glyphosate is utilized and say

2099
01:30:41,039 --> 01:30:46,199
maybe you know if you're buying large

2100
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:48,090
amounts of alfalfa and that you wanted

2101
01:30:46,199 --> 01:30:51,599
I'm talking about using glyphosate on

2102
01:30:48,090 --> 01:30:54,690
the ganja no inputs that come in that we

2103
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:56,550
use for the ganja mm-hmm and and we're

2104
01:30:54,689 --> 01:30:58,500
finding we're doing massive tests on a

2105
01:30:56,550 --> 01:31:00,239
lot of these inputs that people think or

2106
01:30:58,500 --> 01:31:02,010
organic or think that are natural I

2107
01:31:00,239 --> 01:31:03,689
think that our whole foods and they're

2108
01:31:02,010 --> 01:31:05,970
coming out really high in glyphosate

2109
01:31:03,689 --> 01:31:07,859
levels and then we get calls from some

2110
01:31:05,970 --> 01:31:10,500
people and we're saying hey you know our

2111
01:31:07,859 --> 01:31:12,149
soil is becoming acidic over time what's

2112
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:14,279
going on and then we look all the way

2113
01:31:12,149 --> 01:31:16,019
through it and we find out wow the South

2114
01:31:14,279 --> 01:31:18,000
alpha that you've been adding on weekly

2115
01:31:16,020 --> 01:31:19,800
has glyphosate in it and it's killing

2116
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:22,050
your microbiology which is in turn is

2117
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:24,180
making me here in soil acidic yeah so

2118
01:31:22,050 --> 01:31:26,699
it's not just looking at like the

2119
01:31:24,180 --> 01:31:28,590
finished product what goes into it what

2120
01:31:26,699 --> 01:31:31,139
what creates the finished product you

2121
01:31:28,590 --> 01:31:33,270
know how can you be responsible from the

2122
01:31:31,140 --> 01:31:35,490
very first ripple that we do on our farm

2123
01:31:33,270 --> 01:31:37,920
I think Marcus you made a good point I

2124
01:31:35,489 --> 01:31:41,909
mean toxicities everywhere and Tom and

2125
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:44,489
the toxicities everywhere and so when we

2126
01:31:41,909 --> 01:31:47,340
have an opportunity to to choose

2127
01:31:44,489 --> 01:31:49,349
something we're gonna choose the natural

2128
01:31:47,340 --> 01:31:51,029
thing because we're already inundated

2129
01:31:49,350 --> 01:31:53,280
with all the toxins everywhere and I

2130
01:31:51,029 --> 01:31:55,829
think about you know Grass Valley and

2131
01:31:53,279 --> 01:31:58,829
stuff down there I mean charcoal and and

2132
01:31:55,829 --> 01:32:01,109
and carbon and the air is gonna suck out

2133
01:31:58,829 --> 01:32:03,239
all the toxins in the air and then it's

2134
01:32:01,109 --> 01:32:06,719
gonna fall on people and they're gonna

2135
01:32:03,239 --> 01:32:09,359
be breathing in carbon that it's known

2136
01:32:06,720 --> 01:32:11,820
just suck up toxins that's why you take

2137
01:32:09,359 --> 01:32:13,859
activated charcoal every day to flush

2138
01:32:11,819 --> 01:32:15,929
the toxins out of your body and stuff so

2139
01:32:13,859 --> 01:32:18,479
you know I we just believe you know

2140
01:32:15,930 --> 01:32:21,329
toxicity in cannabis and toxicity and

2141
01:32:18,479 --> 01:32:22,829
life is probably our biggest work I mean

2142
01:32:21,329 --> 01:32:24,809
we love growing and cultivating

2143
01:32:22,829 --> 01:32:26,880
everything but like talking about the

2144
01:32:24,810 --> 01:32:28,920
toxicity it's a big thing you know and

2145
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:30,869
suddenly really we really want to start

2146
01:32:28,920 --> 01:32:32,250
to delineate and you really look at what

2147
01:32:30,869 --> 01:32:33,720
it is that you're eating or what it is

2148
01:32:32,250 --> 01:32:35,760
that you're putting in your gardens like

2149
01:32:33,720 --> 01:32:38,039
you were saying Marcus toxicity is

2150
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:40,530
everywhere but if we can do our very

2151
01:32:38,039 --> 01:32:42,750
best and do our research and talk to the

2152
01:32:40,529 --> 01:32:44,729
people who are already doing a good job

2153
01:32:42,750 --> 01:32:47,159
in organics and how they're doing it

2154
01:32:44,729 --> 01:32:49,589
share information then we can bring this

2155
01:32:47,159 --> 01:32:51,539
plant up and I do believe that you know

2156
01:32:49,590 --> 01:32:53,310
like wait you were saying we do need to

2157
01:32:51,539 --> 01:32:55,500
have you know give Big Ups to the plant

2158
01:32:53,310 --> 01:32:58,620
it's important she's brought us all the

2159
01:32:55,500 --> 01:33:00,659
way this far and we're having a you know

2160
01:32:58,619 --> 01:33:02,399
a relationship together it's it's an

2161
01:33:00,659 --> 01:33:04,889
equal relationship the plant and the

2162
01:33:02,399 --> 01:33:06,659
human and how is it that we can do the

2163
01:33:04,890 --> 01:33:09,420
best buy the plant so she can do the

2164
01:33:06,659 --> 01:33:11,729
best buy us well I think that's one of

2165
01:33:09,420 --> 01:33:15,449
the beauties of the Dragonfly earth

2166
01:33:11,729 --> 01:33:17,309
medicine approach closed-loop systems

2167
01:33:15,449 --> 01:33:21,329
like if you're talking about alfalfa

2168
01:33:17,310 --> 01:33:24,090
instead of buying alfalfa that's likely

2169
01:33:21,329 --> 01:33:29,550
been treated with various things like

2170
01:33:24,090 --> 01:33:31,739
glyphosate by alfalfa seed and put it in

2171
01:33:29,550 --> 01:33:34,770
the ground and get it so it's self

2172
01:33:31,738 --> 01:33:37,439
seeding and meantime your compost

2173
01:33:34,770 --> 01:33:40,410
streams everything by generating your

2174
01:33:37,439 --> 01:33:42,238
own inputs on the farm and of course you

2175
01:33:40,409 --> 01:33:45,899
can only do this if you have enough

2176
01:33:42,238 --> 01:33:46,649
space and a place to do it but I think

2177
01:33:45,899 --> 01:33:48,839
any place

2178
01:33:46,649 --> 01:33:51,000
anybody that can have a garden where you

2179
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:53,760
can grow tomatoes you can grow beautiful

2180
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:56,069
cannabis and you can do it responsibly

2181
01:33:53,760 --> 01:34:00,180
in the way that you guys talked about

2182
01:33:56,069 --> 01:34:05,420
closed-loop systems you know worms your

2183
01:34:00,180 --> 01:34:09,450
own compost piles ferments mushrooms

2184
01:34:05,420 --> 01:34:11,220
it's about restoring the environment in

2185
01:34:09,449 --> 01:34:14,039
the place that you're working it's not

2186
01:34:11,220 --> 01:34:17,789
about cannabis can be a resource

2187
01:34:14,039 --> 01:34:22,699
extraction industry or it could be a

2188
01:34:17,789 --> 01:34:27,359
resource rebuilding environment and

2189
01:34:22,699 --> 01:34:30,090
regenerative aspect of it we feel yes

2190
01:34:27,359 --> 01:34:33,599
and it is true you know like in getting

2191
01:34:30,090 --> 01:34:34,770
to what you add on to your tears oils

2192
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:36,900
and what you're adding into your

2193
01:34:34,770 --> 01:34:38,580
reservoirs or whatever to find out where

2194
01:34:36,899 --> 01:34:41,159
those come from and like you're a same

2195
01:34:38,579 --> 01:34:43,710
way yeah closed-loop systems you know a

2196
01:34:41,159 --> 01:34:45,569
hundred percent where it came from and I

2197
01:34:43,710 --> 01:34:48,720
want to remind everybody you know we did

2198
01:34:45,569 --> 01:34:50,609
a numbers game a few years ago on how

2199
01:34:48,720 --> 01:34:53,280
much each one of our plants you know

2200
01:34:50,609 --> 01:34:55,920
cost us to be able to grow and we grow

2201
01:34:53,279 --> 01:34:58,409
huge massive monsters that put out a

2202
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:58,590
whole lot of pounds you know and for BC

2203
01:34:58,409 --> 01:35:01,739
the

2204
01:34:58,590 --> 01:35:06,029
it's a lot and we spent $24 on each

2205
01:35:01,739 --> 01:35:08,069
plant $24 so you know that really takes

2206
01:35:06,029 --> 01:35:09,899
a lot of the stress out of and that's

2207
01:35:08,069 --> 01:35:11,460
how you stay in business the other thing

2208
01:35:09,899 --> 01:35:13,139
is let's not forget what we what we know

2209
01:35:11,460 --> 01:35:15,239
about the plant let's not forget what we

2210
01:35:13,140 --> 01:35:18,270
learned what we learned it's a my it's a

2211
01:35:15,239 --> 01:35:20,519
remediating plant it sucks up what's in

2212
01:35:18,270 --> 01:35:22,290
the earth so we have to be seriously

2213
01:35:20,520 --> 01:35:24,360
careful what we put in there if we want

2214
01:35:22,289 --> 01:35:26,909
the clean safe access that we all are

2215
01:35:24,359 --> 01:35:29,189
talking about and our peer certification

2216
01:35:26,909 --> 01:35:31,050
is is where it sets people up it's not

2217
01:35:29,189 --> 01:35:33,539
just a certification to put rules and

2218
01:35:31,050 --> 01:35:35,210
regulations on people by any means it's

2219
01:35:33,539 --> 01:35:37,920
being able to give farmers the tools

2220
01:35:35,210 --> 01:35:40,020
that they can pass their concentrates

2221
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:41,250
that they pass their flowers so that

2222
01:35:40,020 --> 01:35:43,380
when they go to market that they're

2223
01:35:41,250 --> 01:35:44,789
successful it's not something that's

2224
01:35:43,380 --> 01:35:46,739
like here's a list of a bunch of things

2225
01:35:44,789 --> 01:35:48,210
good luck you know they're feeding their

2226
01:35:46,739 --> 01:35:50,969
mind with healthy food that they're

2227
01:35:48,210 --> 01:35:52,800
growing on the farm it's true the food

2228
01:35:50,970 --> 01:35:54,510
is covered in my club you know you can

2229
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:55,980
get strawberries right now in tustin

2230
01:35:54,510 --> 01:35:57,720
there's Michael a mutant all on it the

2231
01:35:55,979 --> 01:35:59,039
problem with Michael butanol is is the

2232
01:35:57,720 --> 01:36:02,699
smoking of it and it turning into

2233
01:35:59,039 --> 01:36:06,689
cyanide but yes it is a thing and that's

2234
01:36:02,699 --> 01:36:08,989
why we're passionate about it and we're

2235
01:36:06,689 --> 01:36:11,609
working in Canada now to and starting to

2236
01:36:08,989 --> 01:36:15,630
create dialogue about you know a new

2237
01:36:11,609 --> 01:36:18,389
co-op and and and new answers to the

2238
01:36:15,630 --> 01:36:21,800
Bill c-45 and what's happening in Canada

2239
01:36:18,390 --> 01:36:24,060
and it is our work to combine

2240
01:36:21,800 --> 01:36:27,750
like-minded people here in Canada and

2241
01:36:24,060 --> 01:36:28,650
and create a new system that can be

2242
01:36:27,750 --> 01:36:30,390
recognized

2243
01:36:28,649 --> 01:36:33,210
you know forth for the people of Canada

2244
01:36:30,390 --> 01:36:35,250
so that some people that want the lp and

2245
01:36:33,210 --> 01:36:37,289
the the large scale operations can they

2246
01:36:35,250 --> 01:36:38,789
can buy that from them and no one's

2247
01:36:37,289 --> 01:36:40,380
trying to get rid of that and no one

2248
01:36:38,789 --> 01:36:43,409
will be able to get rid of it but we're

2249
01:36:40,380 --> 01:36:45,930
also trying to keep that that conscious

2250
01:36:43,409 --> 01:36:48,479
culture of the herb the herb is a

2251
01:36:45,930 --> 01:36:50,130
natural thing that makes our minds open

2252
01:36:48,479 --> 01:36:51,959
it makes us want to feel good and safe

2253
01:36:50,130 --> 01:36:53,940
access it's so important you know we

2254
01:36:51,960 --> 01:36:56,220
talk about safe access and safe access

2255
01:36:53,939 --> 01:36:58,829
doesn't mean just you know being able to

2256
01:36:56,220 --> 01:37:01,079
access it but that it is safe and people

2257
01:36:58,829 --> 01:37:03,109
who have medical issues which you know

2258
01:37:01,079 --> 01:37:05,640
I'm sorry to say but we're looking at a

2259
01:37:03,109 --> 01:37:08,069
massive amount of people on this planet

2260
01:37:05,640 --> 01:37:09,720
that have medical issues it's very rare

2261
01:37:08,069 --> 01:37:11,579
that I need people that you know are

2262
01:37:09,720 --> 01:37:12,240
even eating organically and running

2263
01:37:11,579 --> 01:37:13,890
every day that

2264
01:37:12,239 --> 01:37:16,199
not having issues you know with the

2265
01:37:13,890 --> 01:37:18,570
amount of toxins that are in the air we

2266
01:37:16,199 --> 01:37:22,800
really owe it to those people to give

2267
01:37:18,569 --> 01:37:24,329
them good safe clean access and I think

2268
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:26,430
it's really important that we educate

2269
01:37:24,329 --> 01:37:28,710
these people and educate these big

2270
01:37:26,430 --> 01:37:31,320
industry people that organics is a

2271
01:37:28,710 --> 01:37:34,859
cheaper route it is a more sustainable

2272
01:37:31,319 --> 01:37:37,380
rare good day people are gonna be

2273
01:37:34,859 --> 01:37:39,179
looking for that clean organic route

2274
01:37:37,380 --> 01:37:41,460
there's no doubt about it it's all about

2275
01:37:39,180 --> 01:37:43,829
people's health and the more toxic the

2276
01:37:41,460 --> 01:37:45,659
earth gets the more toxic we get the

2277
01:37:43,829 --> 01:37:47,489
more of the things everybody's looking

2278
01:37:45,659 --> 01:37:50,189
for the answer in cannabis is but it's

2279
01:37:47,489 --> 01:37:51,449
got to be clean organic cannabis and it

2280
01:37:50,189 --> 01:37:53,939
really starts like you said with the

2281
01:37:51,449 --> 01:37:55,949
inputs and knowing the sources and the

2282
01:37:53,939 --> 01:37:56,669
whole way through the genetics how it's

2283
01:37:55,949 --> 01:37:58,529
been handled

2284
01:37:56,670 --> 01:38:01,890
the whole way through but you know in

2285
01:37:58,529 --> 01:38:06,659
education we can really change things at

2286
01:38:01,890 --> 01:38:08,700
a big level yeah I guess the big problem

2287
01:38:06,659 --> 01:38:10,590
is the profit margins you know it's

2288
01:38:08,699 --> 01:38:12,569
these it's that it's that people are

2289
01:38:10,590 --> 01:38:15,239
locked into these profit margins in the

2290
01:38:12,569 --> 01:38:16,829
now and they're I think that you know I

2291
01:38:15,239 --> 01:38:18,539
don't exactly know how to put it into

2292
01:38:16,829 --> 01:38:20,460
words but you just always see especially

2293
01:38:18,539 --> 01:38:22,229
with the scalability where people are

2294
01:38:20,460 --> 01:38:24,270
just like now we're doing it this way

2295
01:38:22,229 --> 01:38:26,309
now and just like spraying all these

2296
01:38:24,270 --> 01:38:28,740
harmful pesticides it's just

2297
01:38:26,310 --> 01:38:30,120
unbelievable how all of us look at the

2298
01:38:28,739 --> 01:38:33,329
price of all the songs that

2299
01:38:30,119 --> 01:38:35,430
oh yeah it's out of this world and all

2300
01:38:33,329 --> 01:38:37,260
the salts and these salt mixtures that

2301
01:38:35,430 --> 01:38:38,789
are putting in there and it's just you

2302
01:38:37,260 --> 01:38:41,039
can really taste the end in the end

2303
01:38:38,789 --> 01:38:43,019
product at least I can you know what I

2304
01:38:41,039 --> 01:38:46,109
mean and and I'm open to smoking a lot

2305
01:38:43,020 --> 01:38:48,120
of happiness but I was kind of like mine

2306
01:38:46,109 --> 01:38:50,609
you know because I grew it and I took

2307
01:38:48,119 --> 01:38:53,189
care of it and and I think everybody

2308
01:38:50,609 --> 01:38:55,710
should have be able to on some kind of

2309
01:38:53,189 --> 01:38:57,839
scale if they had the desire to be able

2310
01:38:55,710 --> 01:38:59,460
to grow their own own own you really

2311
01:38:57,840 --> 01:39:02,010
know what's going on it you know it's

2312
01:38:59,460 --> 01:39:04,380
been our lifestyle my wife you know has

2313
01:39:02,010 --> 01:39:08,039
has immune system problems her whole

2314
01:39:04,380 --> 01:39:10,260
life and we've found a farm with good

2315
01:39:08,039 --> 01:39:12,180
clean well water and where we can pretty

2316
01:39:10,260 --> 01:39:14,220
much lis take care of ourselves through

2317
01:39:12,180 --> 01:39:18,570
cannabis and all the vegetables we grow

2318
01:39:14,220 --> 01:39:20,970
and stuff and it's it's a full it's a

2319
01:39:18,569 --> 01:39:22,500
full cycle for us and it really keeps

2320
01:39:20,970 --> 01:39:24,900
her healthy she's healthier now than

2321
01:39:22,500 --> 01:39:26,060
she's ever been in her life and that

2322
01:39:24,899 --> 01:39:28,069
she's out there working

2323
01:39:26,060 --> 01:39:29,810
side by side with me in the garden day

2324
01:39:28,069 --> 01:39:31,880
in and day out she's an amazing woman

2325
01:39:29,810 --> 01:39:34,039
and I'm really happy I think a lot of

2326
01:39:31,880 --> 01:39:36,890
people are gonna know that you know the

2327
01:39:34,039 --> 01:39:38,510
clean organic lifestyle is going to be

2328
01:39:36,890 --> 01:39:43,970
the healthiest way if you really want to

2329
01:39:38,510 --> 01:39:45,380
live a long healthy life thank you thank

2330
01:39:43,970 --> 01:39:47,659
you Tom and awesome you know

2331
01:39:45,380 --> 01:39:49,310
unfortunately a lot of these big

2332
01:39:47,659 --> 01:39:50,899
corporations that are coming into the

2333
01:39:49,310 --> 01:39:53,120
cannabis industry right now are looking

2334
01:39:50,899 --> 01:39:55,489
towards big AG to be there educator and

2335
01:39:53,119 --> 01:39:58,550
I'm sorry but when is big AG had good

2336
01:39:55,489 --> 01:40:00,949
ideas they've taken all of our soils

2337
01:39:58,550 --> 01:40:03,079
they've ruined it and they're the ones

2338
01:40:00,949 --> 01:40:05,359
that are saying you know better it's not

2339
01:40:03,079 --> 01:40:07,550
interesting and they don't know better

2340
01:40:05,359 --> 01:40:09,920
and it's unfortunate that a lot of these

2341
01:40:07,550 --> 01:40:11,360
big corporations are not looking towards

2342
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:12,949
maybe the cannabis farmers that have

2343
01:40:11,359 --> 01:40:14,989
been doing this for a really long time

2344
01:40:12,949 --> 01:40:16,909
they're going straight and direct to

2345
01:40:14,989 --> 01:40:19,250
Department of bags and agricultural

2346
01:40:16,909 --> 01:40:22,699
education which to me is just dumbing us

2347
01:40:19,250 --> 01:40:24,680
down and I don't have a place for it no

2348
01:40:22,699 --> 01:40:27,349
me neither I mean you know I've been

2349
01:40:24,680 --> 01:40:29,360
able to educate a lot of people along

2350
01:40:27,350 --> 01:40:31,670
the way on organics you know we had the

2351
01:40:29,359 --> 01:40:33,889
federal government here seven agents

2352
01:40:31,670 --> 01:40:36,140
from the CDC and I got to educate them

2353
01:40:33,890 --> 01:40:38,630
on production the processing of organic

2354
01:40:36,140 --> 01:40:41,329
cannabis and how we do it here on our

2355
01:40:38,630 --> 01:40:44,029
farm and you know that's brought opened

2356
01:40:41,329 --> 01:40:45,439
up a lot of a lot of opportunities for

2357
01:40:44,029 --> 01:40:48,289
me to get out there and keep educating

2358
01:40:45,439 --> 01:40:50,149
about organics and the sustainable ways

2359
01:40:48,289 --> 01:40:52,810
because it like I said at the end of the

2360
01:40:50,149 --> 01:40:54,739
day I don't we got to live here and

2361
01:40:52,810 --> 01:40:56,300
organics is the only way and

2362
01:40:54,739 --> 01:40:59,559
sustainability is the only way I see us

2363
01:40:56,300 --> 01:40:59,560
getting out alive

2364
01:41:01,869 --> 01:41:07,909
what kind of breeding is that you want

2365
01:41:04,670 --> 01:41:10,130
to do with cannabis hey hold on a second

2366
01:41:07,909 --> 01:41:12,859
we were just talking so everyone knows

2367
01:41:10,130 --> 01:41:15,050
cheep seven for those familiar tip days

2368
01:41:12,859 --> 01:41:16,549
Scott you wrote what do you live in

2369
01:41:15,050 --> 01:41:19,130
Oregon you've probably heard a since

2370
01:41:16,550 --> 01:41:22,850
many tips it was one of the first yeah

2371
01:41:19,130 --> 01:41:25,069
journals back in the 80s and I wrote a

2372
01:41:22,850 --> 01:41:28,910
pun I wrote like three articles on

2373
01:41:25,069 --> 01:41:31,009
breeding just basic stuff but the one

2374
01:41:28,909 --> 01:41:33,590
was called lose about reciprocal

2375
01:41:31,010 --> 01:41:37,159
recurrent selection but anyhow to answer

2376
01:41:33,590 --> 01:41:40,000
your question I've already given a two

2377
01:41:37,159 --> 01:41:43,699
talks at the University of Wisconsin

2378
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:47,630
about like what they do you know how we

2379
01:41:43,699 --> 01:41:50,599
use you know how we did breeding in

2380
01:41:47,630 --> 01:41:52,430
industry and then how I would apply and

2381
01:41:50,600 --> 01:41:57,500
then the second seminar was about how I

2382
01:41:52,430 --> 01:41:58,520
would apply that to cannabis and it was

2383
01:41:57,500 --> 01:42:02,119
packed

2384
01:41:58,520 --> 01:42:04,970
both room both seminars were packed and

2385
01:42:02,119 --> 01:42:07,699
they said it was the first seminar ever

2386
01:42:04,970 --> 01:42:10,610
given on cannabis breeding at the etho

2387
01:42:07,699 --> 01:42:14,179
at the University because it's still

2388
01:42:10,609 --> 01:42:19,399
it's still illegal there and it was

2389
01:42:14,180 --> 01:42:21,200
really interesting two days but uh you

2390
01:42:19,399 --> 01:42:23,869
know it has nothing to do okay can you

2391
01:42:21,199 --> 01:42:25,099
describe the technique so basically the

2392
01:42:23,869 --> 01:42:28,670
thing this has nothing to do with

2393
01:42:25,100 --> 01:42:32,270
organic versus pesticide its breeding it

2394
01:42:28,670 --> 01:42:36,109
I mean it's how to make better selection

2395
01:42:32,270 --> 01:42:39,290
decisions and basically the techniques I

2396
01:42:36,109 --> 01:42:43,149
learned were how to pick how to pick the

2397
01:42:39,289 --> 01:42:46,310
best plant even if it's in the wrong

2398
01:42:43,149 --> 01:42:49,759
part of the field and it doesn't like if

2399
01:42:46,310 --> 01:42:52,910
you select it by its genetics you'll

2400
01:42:49,760 --> 01:42:55,489
pick the right plant regardless if it's

2401
01:42:52,909 --> 01:42:58,220
not been nurtured properly you know and

2402
01:42:55,489 --> 01:43:00,319
I can explain all that stuff to you guys

2403
01:42:58,220 --> 01:43:02,449
later I have a whole seminar about it

2404
01:43:00,319 --> 01:43:05,750
and I'm gonna try to give it this week

2405
01:43:02,449 --> 01:43:08,420
at the University of Colorado Marc's

2406
01:43:05,750 --> 01:43:10,909
gonna hook me Colorado State car out of

2407
01:43:08,420 --> 01:43:12,590
state which is where they do the hemp

2408
01:43:10,909 --> 01:43:16,039
breeding and all that but in Fort

2409
01:43:12,590 --> 01:43:18,590
Collins Colorado but um I wouldn't knock

2410
01:43:16,039 --> 01:43:21,560
industry too much because they're like

2411
01:43:18,590 --> 01:43:25,239
ten years ahead of everybody else in

2412
01:43:21,560 --> 01:43:28,250
terms of how to use molecular markers

2413
01:43:25,239 --> 01:43:30,819
that's what my specialty was and it was

2414
01:43:28,250 --> 01:43:34,159
all native traits I didn't do any

2415
01:43:30,819 --> 01:43:35,000
transgenics or any of that exactly what

2416
01:43:34,159 --> 01:43:38,630
you talking about

2417
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:41,420
but molecular markers or genetic markers

2418
01:43:38,630 --> 01:43:44,150
for breeding from cannabis which hardly

2419
01:43:41,420 --> 01:43:47,270
any of identified yet but yes that will

2420
01:43:44,149 --> 01:43:49,189
be the future I agree it's being from

2421
01:43:47,270 --> 01:43:52,130
what I heard through the grapevine all

2422
01:43:49,189 --> 01:43:53,239
the traits are being mapped right now at

2423
01:43:52,130 --> 01:43:55,010
private company

2424
01:43:53,239 --> 01:43:56,929
these they're not all they're not

2425
01:43:55,010 --> 01:43:58,610
sharing all the information because it's

2426
01:43:56,930 --> 01:44:00,140
not you know it's not leave trying to

2427
01:43:58,609 --> 01:44:01,880
develop an electrical property yeah

2428
01:44:00,140 --> 01:44:04,310
they're trying to go up in elections but

2429
01:44:01,880 --> 01:44:06,829
I guarantee you there's enough people

2430
01:44:04,310 --> 01:44:09,920
working on this that somebody is going

2431
01:44:06,829 --> 01:44:12,260
to set up a company that will just

2432
01:44:09,920 --> 01:44:14,390
genotype and they'll do it really

2433
01:44:12,260 --> 01:44:18,230
cheaply and they'll do the whole you

2434
01:44:14,390 --> 01:44:21,170
know not just like specific traits and

2435
01:44:18,229 --> 01:44:23,959
you'll be able to you know like I said

2436
01:44:21,170 --> 01:44:26,840
earlier it would take a long time to

2437
01:44:23,960 --> 01:44:29,359
describe it but it's very very efficient

2438
01:44:26,840 --> 01:44:30,980
and very smart technology and it's my

2439
01:44:29,359 --> 01:44:35,719
class bioscience do that

2440
01:44:30,979 --> 01:44:37,579
what's that doesn't file a finalist has

2441
01:44:35,720 --> 01:44:41,600
already done the fingerprinting so they

2442
01:44:37,579 --> 01:44:44,449
can tell this is different from this but

2443
01:44:41,600 --> 01:44:46,070
the next step is this is better than

2444
01:44:44,449 --> 01:44:49,130
this you know

2445
01:44:46,069 --> 01:44:51,619
like when they get with cows yeah yeah

2446
01:44:49,130 --> 01:44:54,409
and all this stuff is so functional

2447
01:44:51,619 --> 01:44:55,670
genomics it's just it's just genetic

2448
01:44:54,409 --> 01:45:00,500
more it's called marker-assisted

2449
01:44:55,670 --> 01:45:03,770
selection or mass yeah it's where you

2450
01:45:00,500 --> 01:45:06,439
just take a smear of each plant and you

2451
01:45:03,770 --> 01:45:08,330
can come from that smear whether it's

2452
01:45:06,439 --> 01:45:12,289
more appropriate for the particular

2453
01:45:08,329 --> 01:45:16,100
ginger you're looking at and my

2454
01:45:12,289 --> 01:45:18,260
specialty with complex traits like yield

2455
01:45:16,100 --> 01:45:20,620
and that you have to handle in a

2456
01:45:18,260 --> 01:45:23,090
different way because there's not like

2457
01:45:20,619 --> 01:45:24,859
specific yield genes there there are

2458
01:45:23,090 --> 01:45:26,600
yield genes but they have a different

2459
01:45:24,859 --> 01:45:29,509
effect in every background so you have

2460
01:45:26,600 --> 01:45:32,539
to study each background separately and

2461
01:45:29,510 --> 01:45:36,560
that's kind of that knowledge is not

2462
01:45:32,539 --> 01:45:38,840
well known not even in industry we this

2463
01:45:36,560 --> 01:45:41,840
was something that was top-secret when I

2464
01:45:38,840 --> 01:45:43,789
was working at Pioneer and I'm finally

2465
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:46,190
allowed to talk about it because I

2466
01:45:43,789 --> 01:45:48,739
published a couple papers on it and so

2467
01:45:46,189 --> 01:45:51,649
now now I can talk about it but it

2468
01:45:48,739 --> 01:45:53,269
wasn't easy to let them to get

2469
01:45:51,649 --> 01:45:55,699
permission to talk about without the

2470
01:45:53,270 --> 01:46:00,110
rights to use that I'll just write it to

2471
01:45:55,699 --> 01:46:01,970
everybody I read your papers good good

2472
01:46:00,109 --> 01:46:04,399
I'm glad you read it man I'm my probably

2473
01:46:01,970 --> 01:46:06,739
already patented your process - no I'm

2474
01:46:04,399 --> 01:46:10,069
not patenting things I I want

2475
01:46:06,738 --> 01:46:17,029
my Papa did he said he patented your

2476
01:46:10,069 --> 01:46:18,828
process okay did you power to you man so

2477
01:46:17,029 --> 01:46:20,988
I mean I'm I've been waiting for two

2478
01:46:18,828 --> 01:46:23,658
years to do this but I I'm married a

2479
01:46:20,988 --> 01:46:26,988
Brazilian and it took us two years to

2480
01:46:23,658 --> 01:46:32,118
get us permanent residency and now we

2481
01:46:26,988 --> 01:46:36,859
finally can move to a cool state Iowa is

2482
01:46:32,118 --> 01:46:40,549
terrible I was just doing as little as

2483
01:46:36,859 --> 01:46:44,268
they possibly can yeah that's great corn

2484
01:46:40,550 --> 01:46:47,900
isn't it corn and soybeans

2485
01:46:44,269 --> 01:46:51,289
I personally modified corn yeah I mean I

2486
01:46:47,899 --> 01:46:55,578
mean I was my program at pioneer was

2487
01:46:51,288 --> 01:46:58,368
Native traits like not using transgenics

2488
01:46:55,578 --> 01:47:00,349
because it doesn't always make sense you

2489
01:46:58,368 --> 01:47:02,689
know sometimes the jeans are out there

2490
01:47:00,349 --> 01:47:05,349
you don't have to you don't have to pull

2491
01:47:02,689 --> 01:47:09,589
them out of another species no and

2492
01:47:05,349 --> 01:47:15,199
that's still 9 90% of plant breeding is

2493
01:47:09,590 --> 01:47:18,469
still that what you hear is like the

2494
01:47:15,198 --> 01:47:22,788
transgenic stuff is still only a small

2495
01:47:18,469 --> 01:47:25,698
part it's it's um it's the pesticides

2496
01:47:22,788 --> 01:47:28,578
that are the problem not the genes you

2497
01:47:25,698 --> 01:47:31,339
know because you know you put a few

2498
01:47:28,578 --> 01:47:35,929
things together yeah these are together

2499
01:47:31,340 --> 01:47:39,619
they're bred to handle lots of pesticide

2500
01:47:35,929 --> 01:47:41,719
yeah so yeah you're right totally a

2501
01:47:39,618 --> 01:47:44,029
control the disease and they control the

2502
01:47:41,719 --> 01:47:46,639
medicine and and the other thing I know

2503
01:47:44,029 --> 01:47:49,130
from growing soybeans in the greenhouse

2504
01:47:46,639 --> 01:47:52,038
it's it's not easy to grow them

2505
01:47:49,130 --> 01:47:56,328
organically you know you really have to

2506
01:47:52,038 --> 01:47:58,488
control things and I grew I grew we

2507
01:47:56,328 --> 01:48:02,719
organically but on a very small scale

2508
01:47:58,488 --> 01:48:04,848
and I had fans going to prevent the

2509
01:48:02,719 --> 01:48:08,300
fungi from taking hold and all that

2510
01:48:04,849 --> 01:48:10,998
stuff but number I'm really excited to

2511
01:48:08,300 --> 01:48:13,099
just actually dive into this now because

2512
01:48:10,998 --> 01:48:15,170
I've been waiting I don't like me he's

2513
01:48:13,099 --> 01:48:17,569
an industry retread I mean like when you

2514
01:48:15,170 --> 01:48:19,729
guys joshie tell him I love you I love

2515
01:48:17,569 --> 01:48:20,539
everything that you guys do everything

2516
01:48:19,729 --> 01:48:23,090
you say is so

2517
01:48:20,539 --> 01:48:26,269
scientifically right on it's so like you

2518
01:48:23,090 --> 01:48:27,890
guys are even connected and with the

2519
01:48:26,270 --> 01:48:30,140
scientific underpinning of everything

2520
01:48:27,890 --> 01:48:31,610
that you say and I just wanted to go

2521
01:48:30,140 --> 01:48:34,340
back to your comment about an industry

2522
01:48:31,609 --> 01:48:36,469
again yeah I used to be it worked some

2523
01:48:34,340 --> 01:48:38,569
big bad chemical company that I probably

2524
01:48:36,470 --> 01:48:41,869
should have worked but that's how I met

2525
01:48:38,569 --> 01:48:43,399
this guy right and we stand what brought

2526
01:48:41,869 --> 01:48:46,010
us together remember what brought us

2527
01:48:43,399 --> 01:48:48,319
together music guitar kick guitar right

2528
01:48:46,010 --> 01:48:51,890
guitar music jerry garcia brought us

2529
01:48:48,319 --> 01:48:54,500
together and and now we have a champion

2530
01:48:51,890 --> 01:48:56,960
soybean breeder who said our revoit

2531
01:48:54,500 --> 01:48:59,720
industry and jumping into the cannabis

2532
01:48:56,960 --> 01:49:02,920
world and it is we need more people like

2533
01:48:59,720 --> 01:49:05,900
me and scott you know who of course

2534
01:49:02,920 --> 01:49:11,300
because if you believe that cannabis can

2535
01:49:05,899 --> 01:49:14,179
rejuvenate and revitalize and improve

2536
01:49:11,300 --> 01:49:17,150
everybody's life well that includes big

2537
01:49:14,180 --> 01:49:19,760
industry let's get big industry love the

2538
01:49:17,149 --> 01:49:22,129
cannabis so hopefully it will improve

2539
01:49:19,760 --> 01:49:29,930
all of them including the industry

2540
01:49:22,130 --> 01:49:31,730
itself and you know mark honestly you

2541
01:49:29,930 --> 01:49:33,350
got a wonder was it Jerry Garcia that

2542
01:49:31,729 --> 01:49:36,649
originally brought you guys together or

2543
01:49:33,350 --> 01:49:39,050
was it we you know it's like often the

2544
01:49:36,649 --> 01:49:42,139
first conversation is yeah it's like the

2545
01:49:39,050 --> 01:49:44,720
cannabis is it together and I just love

2546
01:49:42,140 --> 01:49:47,900
that it really is true that not only is

2547
01:49:44,720 --> 01:49:50,150
it you know remediating the soil but

2548
01:49:47,899 --> 01:49:51,469
it's remediating our minds you know so

2549
01:49:50,149 --> 01:49:53,420
many of us are able to have these

2550
01:49:51,470 --> 01:49:55,490
conversations in depth and be able to

2551
01:49:53,420 --> 01:49:58,039
see all different parts of the wheel

2552
01:49:55,489 --> 01:49:59,869
because our mind has been remediated by

2553
01:49:58,039 --> 01:50:03,170
this amazing plan I think it's really

2554
01:49:59,869 --> 01:50:05,630
awesome how mysterious and unbelievable

2555
01:50:03,170 --> 01:50:07,970
the ganja plant is and how many layers

2556
01:50:05,630 --> 01:50:10,550
like you can't just transgenic it you

2557
01:50:07,970 --> 01:50:14,860
can't just genetically you can't just

2558
01:50:10,550 --> 01:50:18,230
that the heads and the whatever the

2559
01:50:14,859 --> 01:50:20,929
cryogenics so deep and so technical that

2560
01:50:18,229 --> 01:50:22,729
the greatest of minds are just racking

2561
01:50:20,930 --> 01:50:28,039
their selves over it and the plants just

2562
01:50:22,729 --> 01:50:28,729
like give me some Sun I love it it is a

2563
01:50:28,039 --> 01:50:31,430
beautiful thing

2564
01:50:28,729 --> 01:50:33,739
I like that conversation to go back to

2565
01:50:31,430 --> 01:50:34,340
mark and the chief there I I could do

2566
01:50:33,739 --> 01:50:36,559
what we could do

2567
01:50:34,340 --> 01:50:39,050
hache church on this and invite some of

2568
01:50:36,560 --> 01:50:41,060
the people from segre that have built a

2569
01:50:39,050 --> 01:50:42,619
molecular biology lab and are also

2570
01:50:41,060 --> 01:50:44,990
looking into doing that work we can

2571
01:50:42,619 --> 01:50:47,180
invite Kevin mckernon we could invite

2572
01:50:44,989 --> 01:50:49,539
mouths Lee from we could have a really

2573
01:50:47,180 --> 01:50:52,310
great conversation have Sam of course

2574
01:50:49,539 --> 01:50:53,960
that would be a good like three to four

2575
01:50:52,310 --> 01:50:55,490
hour one I was even thinking I don't

2576
01:50:53,960 --> 01:50:57,260
know what your seminar is but you should

2577
01:50:55,489 --> 01:51:00,829
definitely come do it on bubble man's

2578
01:50:57,260 --> 01:51:03,710
world he'd love to see well I have two

2579
01:51:00,829 --> 01:51:09,350
seminars they both take about in an hour

2580
01:51:03,710 --> 01:51:12,710
so it's not know and one is one is you

2581
01:51:09,350 --> 01:51:16,039
know basically what I did in soybean and

2582
01:51:12,710 --> 01:51:21,109
it would really change it was a big

2583
01:51:16,039 --> 01:51:23,930
breakthrough and but the same thing will

2584
01:51:21,109 --> 01:51:26,329
work in cannabis it's it's it's it's

2585
01:51:23,930 --> 01:51:29,270
just another crop you know it's there

2586
01:51:26,329 --> 01:51:31,789
the differences the second seminar is

2587
01:51:29,270 --> 01:51:35,050
about how cannabis is different from

2588
01:51:31,789 --> 01:51:37,970
other crops and how that affects the

2589
01:51:35,050 --> 01:51:42,050
strategy in the tweaking the tweaking of

2590
01:51:37,970 --> 01:51:44,420
the IP what's that like how you would

2591
01:51:42,050 --> 01:51:47,779
tweak the IP that works for soybeans to

2592
01:51:44,420 --> 01:51:49,960
make it work with cannabis yeah and in

2593
01:51:47,779 --> 01:51:52,969
fact cannabis is a lot easier because

2594
01:51:49,960 --> 01:51:56,029
the fact that you once you have a plant

2595
01:51:52,970 --> 01:51:58,100
you like you can just clone it it's not

2596
01:51:56,029 --> 01:52:00,889
that easy and soybean you know you gotta

2597
01:51:58,100 --> 01:52:03,800
like in breed it and fix it for all the

2598
01:52:00,890 --> 01:52:06,950
traits and it's it's it's like an eight

2599
01:52:03,800 --> 01:52:09,320
year process you know Jesus cuz you got

2600
01:52:06,949 --> 01:52:12,229
to test it well I can't in soybean it

2601
01:52:09,319 --> 01:52:13,429
has to be better and it has to be tested

2602
01:52:12,229 --> 01:52:15,889
across like a hundred different

2603
01:52:13,430 --> 01:52:18,320
fireman's or nobody's gonna buy it

2604
01:52:15,890 --> 01:52:23,660
so that's you're talking about four a

2605
01:52:18,319 --> 01:52:26,329
four seed variety yeah any introduced

2606
01:52:23,659 --> 01:52:29,029
bone that's one thing but if you want a

2607
01:52:26,329 --> 01:52:31,850
four seed variety achievement are given

2608
01:52:29,029 --> 01:52:34,880
eight years probably yeah yeah like if

2609
01:52:31,850 --> 01:52:38,150
you can do something like Sam knows this

2610
01:52:34,880 --> 01:52:43,730
you can do some em breeding did you say

2611
01:52:38,149 --> 01:52:49,019
that um you got the f3 now we got to f4

2612
01:52:43,729 --> 01:52:52,449
and a few cases in f5 but it

2613
01:52:49,020 --> 01:52:56,680
every negative recessive trait pops up

2614
01:52:52,449 --> 01:52:59,439
and it has absolutely no health no vigor

2615
01:52:56,680 --> 01:53:02,289
and in most cases it's functionally

2616
01:52:59,439 --> 01:53:05,439
sterile which means the pollen although

2617
01:53:02,289 --> 01:53:10,149
it still can be transferred by q-tip -

2618
01:53:05,439 --> 01:53:12,699
it doesn't that he's and it it's sticky

2619
01:53:10,149 --> 01:53:15,399
or something like that so it's

2620
01:53:12,699 --> 01:53:19,269
impossible to breathe without extra

2621
01:53:15,399 --> 01:53:20,859
extra care well so most soybean

2622
01:53:19,270 --> 01:53:24,720
varieties even though they were

2623
01:53:20,859 --> 01:53:28,449
supposedly inbred they were f3 derived

2624
01:53:24,720 --> 01:53:30,880
so they still had a lot of segregation

2625
01:53:28,449 --> 01:53:32,619
even even though all the plants look the

2626
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:35,199
same and it's probably going to be the

2627
01:53:32,619 --> 01:53:38,399
same thing in cannabis maybe they'll be

2628
01:53:35,199 --> 01:53:40,739
f2 derived but you'll select

2629
01:53:38,399 --> 01:53:42,729
phenotypically so that it looks uniform

2630
01:53:40,739 --> 01:53:45,250
but you're never gonna get it

2631
01:53:42,729 --> 01:53:48,009
genetically homozygous it would die

2632
01:53:45,250 --> 01:53:50,619
before that and are you are you familiar

2633
01:53:48,010 --> 01:53:52,510
with them allen cap euler's work or AKA

2634
01:53:50,619 --> 01:53:55,359
mushroom he's got like the largest

2635
01:53:52,510 --> 01:53:58,000
soybean collection in the world and has

2636
01:53:55,359 --> 01:53:59,769
done amazing amounts of work with the

2637
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:02,739
genome and and all different kinds of

2638
01:53:59,770 --> 01:54:05,220
things for soybeans well the world

2639
01:54:02,739 --> 01:54:07,779
collection that I knew that I used to

2640
01:54:05,220 --> 01:54:09,930
champion Illinois it had like 30

2641
01:54:07,779 --> 01:54:13,719
thousand different accessions and I've

2642
01:54:09,930 --> 01:54:17,590
tapped it several times screened it for

2643
01:54:13,720 --> 01:54:19,990
various traits and I actually came up

2644
01:54:17,590 --> 01:54:23,079
with some really cool you know like some

2645
01:54:19,989 --> 01:54:26,139
wild soybeans that I have a patent on a

2646
01:54:23,079 --> 01:54:28,420
fart list soybean the soybean that

2647
01:54:26,140 --> 01:54:32,920
doesn't make you fart fart list soybean

2648
01:54:28,420 --> 01:54:35,289
it doesn't give you gas and it was just

2649
01:54:32,920 --> 01:54:37,539
a mutant that didn't produce stachyose

2650
01:54:35,289 --> 01:54:40,420
that here's stachyose is what makes you

2651
01:54:37,539 --> 01:54:44,260
fart but it never really made it to the

2652
01:54:40,420 --> 01:54:48,069
market because it was only worth to pig

2653
01:54:44,260 --> 01:54:51,760
as pig feed for chicken feed it was only

2654
01:54:48,069 --> 01:54:56,319
worth 50 cents more bushel and it cost

2655
01:54:51,760 --> 01:55:00,100
50 cents just to keep it separate so the

2656
01:54:56,319 --> 01:55:01,489
identity preservation costs are 50 cents

2657
01:55:00,100 --> 01:55:03,500
so you

2658
01:55:01,489 --> 01:55:05,659
all the value because you have to keep

2659
01:55:03,500 --> 01:55:07,520
it separate you know keeping separate

2660
01:55:05,659 --> 01:55:10,789
elevators and that I thought after that

2661
01:55:07,520 --> 01:55:13,220
so like economics plays a big role in

2662
01:55:10,789 --> 01:55:15,769
what makes it to market you know but

2663
01:55:13,220 --> 01:55:21,770
that's good that's that's been how

2664
01:55:15,770 --> 01:55:24,620
economics affects farting yeah it's like

2665
01:55:21,770 --> 01:55:29,510
well we don't really care if the pigs if

2666
01:55:24,619 --> 01:55:30,640
it's not worth more than 50 cents that's

2667
01:55:29,510 --> 01:55:33,170
crazy

2668
01:55:30,640 --> 01:55:33,680
nothing with fart less beans though come

2669
01:55:33,170 --> 01:55:35,090
on

2670
01:55:33,680 --> 01:55:37,789
that's what's screwing up the atmosphere

2671
01:55:35,090 --> 01:55:40,760
of methane that's way worse than co2

2672
01:55:37,789 --> 01:55:42,319
it's like it's like 10 times worse than

2673
01:55:40,760 --> 01:55:46,070
carbon dioxide

2674
01:55:42,319 --> 01:55:48,259
shout out faded faded AF who said that

2675
01:55:46,069 --> 01:55:50,259
gold the avenue is less methane with

2676
01:55:48,260 --> 01:55:52,730
fart less beans

2677
01:55:50,260 --> 01:55:54,980
that's pretty hilarious that's just

2678
01:55:52,729 --> 01:55:57,409
funny that you you just never know

2679
01:55:54,979 --> 01:56:04,609
what's gonna come up in conversation on

2680
01:55:57,409 --> 01:56:07,099
hash Church but every campus is like is

2681
01:56:04,609 --> 01:56:07,969
a plant breeders dream because you're in

2682
01:56:07,100 --> 01:56:12,670
the infancy

2683
01:56:07,970 --> 01:56:15,590
there's tons of variation there's oh

2684
01:56:12,670 --> 01:56:18,859
it's like the coolest plant to work on I

2685
01:56:15,590 --> 01:56:22,760
think and it's me it's medicine it's

2686
01:56:18,859 --> 01:56:27,170
food it's fiber it's it's good for the

2687
01:56:22,760 --> 01:56:29,180
soil it's unbelievable that day that

2688
01:56:27,170 --> 01:56:31,850
it's illegal I mean I just can't get

2689
01:56:29,180 --> 01:56:34,100
that shows you well that's why it's

2690
01:56:31,850 --> 01:56:37,039
illegal and all I think all the things

2691
01:56:34,100 --> 01:56:39,710
you just said are exactly why it's

2692
01:56:37,039 --> 01:56:42,409
illegal but there's all these people

2693
01:56:39,710 --> 01:56:44,720
like us they're just so passionate about

2694
01:56:42,409 --> 01:56:47,180
it we can't believe it you know it keeps

2695
01:56:44,720 --> 01:56:50,360
us up at night you know so I was like I

2696
01:56:47,180 --> 01:56:52,070
got a cool statement there's six hundred

2697
01:56:50,359 --> 01:56:54,529
people or five hundred and sixty people

2698
01:56:52,069 --> 01:56:56,269
watching right now just for us to talk

2699
01:56:54,529 --> 01:56:58,489
about this very thing there's a lot of

2700
01:56:56,270 --> 01:57:01,160
people worldwide and it's growing more

2701
01:56:58,489 --> 01:57:03,199
and more and more as I see people

2702
01:57:01,159 --> 01:57:06,829
developing a relationship outside of

2703
01:57:03,199 --> 01:57:08,359
that that strip of prohibition that we

2704
01:57:06,829 --> 01:57:10,279
all have you know the most passionate

2705
01:57:08,359 --> 01:57:11,989
seem to be like you really have to push

2706
01:57:10,279 --> 01:57:13,909
through that prohibition thing it's like

2707
01:57:11,989 --> 01:57:15,550
so this is going to endanger my life my

2708
01:57:13,909 --> 01:57:18,819
family my freedom I say

2709
01:57:15,550 --> 01:57:21,159
like all of these things my like it's a

2710
01:57:18,819 --> 01:57:24,279
it's a big thing to step through that

2711
01:57:21,159 --> 01:57:26,529
veil and and and sort of own all of that

2712
01:57:24,279 --> 01:57:29,529
to be a canvas person in the last 30 40

2713
01:57:26,529 --> 01:57:31,239
50 years and now we're into entering

2714
01:57:29,529 --> 01:57:33,099
this new level where I think there's

2715
01:57:31,239 --> 01:57:35,229
some of the animosity comes from people

2716
01:57:33,100 --> 01:57:36,550
from though from the community the old

2717
01:57:35,229 --> 01:57:38,919
school community where they see these

2718
01:57:36,550 --> 01:57:40,570
people coming in that have not had to

2719
01:57:38,920 --> 01:57:42,940
step through that veil and personally I

2720
01:57:40,569 --> 01:57:45,399
say stop presenting people for for not

2721
01:57:42,939 --> 01:57:47,289
having to step through that veil because

2722
01:57:45,399 --> 01:57:49,689
that's the whole point of our activism

2723
01:57:47,289 --> 01:57:51,880
for the last 50 plus years was to remove

2724
01:57:49,689 --> 01:57:53,529
that veil so that people could step

2725
01:57:51,880 --> 01:57:54,819
freely through it and it doesn't matter

2726
01:57:53,529 --> 01:57:56,829
if they haven't been involved in the

2727
01:57:54,819 --> 01:57:59,439
industry for 10 or 20 or 30 or 40 years

2728
01:57:56,829 --> 01:58:01,930
it's okay they can still come and and

2729
01:57:59,439 --> 01:58:03,849
put their hat in the ring and and do

2730
01:58:01,930 --> 01:58:06,700
their thing and I'm excited to see that

2731
01:58:03,850 --> 01:58:08,410
sort of opening it's sort of like now

2732
01:58:06,699 --> 01:58:10,389
we're instead of breeding with like a

2733
01:58:08,409 --> 01:58:12,279
hundred or a thousand we're opening it

2734
01:58:10,390 --> 01:58:13,690
up to the millions you know to hundreds

2735
01:58:12,279 --> 01:58:15,789
of thousands the numbers are just so

2736
01:58:13,689 --> 01:58:39,599
great that we're gonna pull some great

2737
01:58:15,789 --> 01:58:43,149
people into this into this industry grow

2738
01:58:39,600 --> 01:58:45,100
I mean isn't it better for them to grow

2739
01:58:43,149 --> 01:58:48,699
earth that the infringing dart or a

2740
01:58:45,100 --> 01:58:50,500
policeman straight up I'm in the same

2741
01:58:48,699 --> 01:58:52,090
agreeance and I also get criticized for

2742
01:58:50,500 --> 01:58:53,649
it when they're like now they're coming

2743
01:58:52,090 --> 01:58:55,180
in to take over the industry it's like

2744
01:58:53,649 --> 01:58:56,379
no they're just coming in to be a part

2745
01:58:55,180 --> 01:58:58,210
in the industry no we're not gonna let

2746
01:58:56,380 --> 01:59:00,670
anyone take anything we're the ones that

2747
01:58:58,210 --> 01:59:03,489
our own civil disobedience is the thing

2748
01:59:00,670 --> 01:59:05,649
that's why we're so protective of our

2749
01:59:03,489 --> 01:59:08,050
baby yeah I guess because civil

2750
01:59:05,649 --> 01:59:09,460
disobedience that's opened up this

2751
01:59:08,050 --> 01:59:12,100
Avenue now it's just a matter of

2752
01:59:09,460 --> 01:59:14,409
maintaining some proper stewards you

2753
01:59:12,100 --> 01:59:15,940
know Hillary black she gets she gets

2754
01:59:14,409 --> 01:59:17,949
people on her all the time because she

2755
01:59:15,939 --> 01:59:20,500
works for canopy and it's like I love

2756
01:59:17,949 --> 01:59:23,739
having Hillary black in the ear of

2757
01:59:20,500 --> 01:59:26,199
canopy I could not picture a better

2758
01:59:23,739 --> 01:59:28,149
person to be in the you know I heard

2759
01:59:26,199 --> 01:59:29,170
recently canopy is now bigger than like

2760
01:59:28,149 --> 01:59:32,170
Air Canada

2761
01:59:29,170 --> 01:59:34,449
and WestJet combines two of our big

2762
01:59:32,170 --> 01:59:36,640
airlines in Canada this is a cannabis

2763
01:59:34,448 --> 01:59:39,309
company and they have Hillary Black in

2764
01:59:36,640 --> 01:59:42,850
their ear I have my money on Hillary

2765
01:59:39,310 --> 01:59:45,280
over canopy in in that conversation

2766
01:59:42,850 --> 01:59:47,230
she's just too sweet she'll just infect

2767
01:59:45,279 --> 01:59:49,179
them with sweetness and hurt her

2768
01:59:47,229 --> 01:59:53,649
positivity and and the way she's always

2769
01:59:49,179 --> 01:59:55,929
been a real proper stewardess of the

2770
01:59:53,649 --> 01:59:58,599
plant you know of the highest integrity

2771
01:59:55,929 --> 02:00:00,670
and I don't think that we've brought her

2772
01:59:58,600 --> 02:00:02,560
to not educate people on it you know I

2773
02:00:00,670 --> 02:00:04,480
think that it's totally important that

2774
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:06,730
new people are coming and being involved

2775
02:00:04,479 --> 02:00:08,829
but I think that we can take all of what

2776
02:00:06,729 --> 02:00:13,419
we've learned in the past 40 years and

2777
02:00:08,829 --> 02:00:15,159
bring it forward to to make it more you

2778
02:00:13,420 --> 02:00:19,480
know viable for the industry to go

2779
02:00:15,159 --> 02:00:21,340
forward and have success I would hope it

2780
02:00:19,479 --> 02:00:24,089
would be more respect I go to a lot of

2781
02:00:21,340 --> 02:00:27,219
conferences and I went to one last week

2782
02:00:24,090 --> 02:00:28,690
maybe look down on the Pioneers I was

2783
02:00:27,219 --> 02:00:31,929
sitting next to a table of people

2784
02:00:28,689 --> 02:00:33,849
talking and I overheard him say wow

2785
02:00:31,929 --> 02:00:36,340
you're a true pioneer you've been in the

2786
02:00:33,850 --> 02:00:38,590
industry for four years and I was this

2787
02:00:36,340 --> 02:00:40,270
like I had to speak up I whoa whoa whoa

2788
02:00:38,590 --> 02:00:40,810
whoa whoa whoa let's hold on a minute

2789
02:00:40,270 --> 02:00:42,910
now

2790
02:00:40,810 --> 02:00:45,400
there's been people doing this 4050

2791
02:00:42,909 --> 02:00:47,800
years people are dedicated my friends

2792
02:00:45,399 --> 02:00:49,569
went to jail they died also you have the

2793
02:00:47,800 --> 02:00:50,920
honor of doing this and you don't know

2794
02:00:49,569 --> 02:00:53,439
me or you don't know any of these people

2795
02:00:50,920 --> 02:00:57,640
what they've done you know before you

2796
02:00:53,439 --> 02:00:59,289
throw a broad spectrum you know diss on

2797
02:00:57,640 --> 02:01:01,630
our whole community and all the people

2798
02:00:59,289 --> 02:01:03,159
that got you here you know let's step

2799
02:01:01,630 --> 02:01:05,679
back and you should respect this a

2800
02:01:03,159 --> 02:01:09,550
little bit more so it's it's a two-edged

2801
02:01:05,679 --> 02:01:11,289
sword out there we don't you know I love

2802
02:01:09,550 --> 02:01:13,570
all the science that's come into the

2803
02:01:11,289 --> 02:01:15,359
industry a really you know raises the

2804
02:01:13,569 --> 02:01:18,759
bar and puts it into a whole nother

2805
02:01:15,359 --> 02:01:21,719
international level I love that part but

2806
02:01:18,760 --> 02:01:23,980
just a little respect from people

2807
02:01:21,719 --> 02:01:25,600
towards the Pioneers would be in a

2808
02:01:23,979 --> 02:01:27,250
highly appreciate that that goes back to

2809
02:01:25,600 --> 02:01:28,780
perspective it's kind of when you hear

2810
02:01:27,250 --> 02:01:31,210
like a fourteen-year-old kid said

2811
02:01:28,779 --> 02:01:33,579
remember back in the day and that was

2812
02:01:31,210 --> 02:01:35,710
like three years ago because that's what

2813
02:01:33,579 --> 02:01:38,229
his perspective is and it's a perfect

2814
02:01:35,710 --> 02:01:40,149
example of even how you framed it was

2815
02:01:38,229 --> 02:01:42,329
like your friends went to jail your

2816
02:01:40,149 --> 02:01:44,339
friends died well that's still a very

2817
02:01:42,329 --> 02:01:46,500
small perspective when you go back some

2818
02:01:44,340 --> 02:01:48,600
centuries to people that were being

2819
02:01:46,500 --> 02:01:50,010
flogged and murdered and killed over

2820
02:01:48,600 --> 02:01:52,140
this plant this has been happening for

2821
02:01:50,010 --> 02:01:55,380
so much longer than any of us have been

2822
02:01:52,140 --> 02:01:57,539
alive that it's it's a real thing like

2823
02:01:55,380 --> 02:02:00,810
this this prohibition of cannabis goes

2824
02:01:57,539 --> 02:02:03,420
back way beyond our friends and family

2825
02:02:00,810 --> 02:02:05,130
way beyond 40 or 50 years it goes far

2826
02:02:03,420 --> 02:02:07,560
back for these countries to have

2827
02:02:05,130 --> 02:02:08,970
produced these plants these Sufis to

2828
02:02:07,560 --> 02:02:11,039
have gone through the torture that they

2829
02:02:08,970 --> 02:02:12,600
went through for eating hashish like all

2830
02:02:11,039 --> 02:02:14,310
of these different histories it would be

2831
02:02:12,600 --> 02:02:15,539
great to have Chris Bennett in the room

2832
02:02:14,310 --> 02:02:17,280
right now because he busted out an

2833
02:02:15,539 --> 02:02:20,789
accurate description of all these things

2834
02:02:17,279 --> 02:02:22,710
but you know those guys are also a part

2835
02:02:20,789 --> 02:02:25,109
of that pioneering that maybe we don't

2836
02:02:22,710 --> 02:02:27,029
give credit to enough so now we can

2837
02:02:25,109 --> 02:02:28,889
easily see why maybe the next group

2838
02:02:27,029 --> 02:02:30,989
isn't giving credit easily enough it's

2839
02:02:28,890 --> 02:02:32,760
all about our perspective and how it's

2840
02:02:30,989 --> 02:02:35,969
framed in the timeline that we've

2841
02:02:32,760 --> 02:02:37,800
existed in and so I agree with you on

2842
02:02:35,970 --> 02:02:39,960
one level and on the other level I just

2843
02:02:37,800 --> 02:02:42,690
see it as a natural cycle of humans that

2844
02:02:39,960 --> 02:02:46,020
we ourselves as the apparent pioneers in

2845
02:02:42,689 --> 02:02:49,169
this particular 40 to 50 year run are

2846
02:02:46,020 --> 02:02:51,000
maybe also forgetting the the last 50

2847
02:02:49,170 --> 02:02:53,550
before us and the hundred years before

2848
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:54,960
that and the you know these cultivars to

2849
02:02:53,550 --> 02:02:57,329
have they've come a long way these

2850
02:02:54,960 --> 02:03:02,939
plants these these are not yesterday's

2851
02:02:57,329 --> 02:03:07,829
plants smoking cannabis for about 500

2852
02:03:02,939 --> 02:03:11,429
years before that because smoking is a

2853
02:03:07,829 --> 02:03:14,850
new world convention cannabis was an old

2854
02:03:11,430 --> 02:03:18,600
world invention so Columbus had to mix

2855
02:03:14,850 --> 02:03:20,250
the two up before we started smoking but

2856
02:03:18,600 --> 02:03:22,079
there was prohibition there was

2857
02:03:20,250 --> 02:03:25,170
prohibition in the evening of cannabis -

2858
02:03:22,079 --> 02:03:28,140
oh absolutely the Garden of Poker in

2859
02:03:25,170 --> 02:03:30,239
Egypt you know I think there was 1350 or

2860
02:03:28,140 --> 02:03:32,010
something like that like you said if

2861
02:03:30,239 --> 02:03:34,710
they caught you they would give you

2862
02:03:32,010 --> 02:03:38,489
rotten milk make you drink it and if you

2863
02:03:34,710 --> 02:03:43,230
threw up brain or the Eton hashish then

2864
02:03:38,489 --> 02:03:45,719
they pulled your teeth out oh that's

2865
02:03:43,229 --> 02:03:48,899
just nuts and you know there's there's

2866
02:03:45,720 --> 02:03:51,480
5,000 years it goes backs as amok

2867
02:03:48,899 --> 02:03:54,359
moxibustion you know cannabis was used

2868
02:03:51,479 --> 02:03:55,769
to burn and moxibustion and you can see

2869
02:03:54,359 --> 02:03:58,799
that in the old

2870
02:03:55,770 --> 02:04:00,600
ancient Chinese health texts and if they

2871
02:03:58,800 --> 02:04:02,789
were burning it then it was all around

2872
02:04:00,600 --> 02:04:04,110
the patient so the Scythian stood that

2873
02:04:02,789 --> 02:04:06,510
as well didn't they aren't they one of

2874
02:04:04,109 --> 02:04:07,829
the oldest once again I wish Chris was

2875
02:04:06,510 --> 02:04:13,890
here because he's just got such a great

2876
02:04:07,829 --> 02:04:16,829
grasp on the Chinese maybe two or three

2877
02:04:13,890 --> 02:04:18,690
thousand years ago you have a Cynthia

2878
02:04:16,829 --> 02:04:23,159
miss what they did was made through

2879
02:04:18,689 --> 02:04:26,279
flowering cannabis on top of embers in a

2880
02:04:23,159 --> 02:04:30,119
fire underneath attempt they got in the

2881
02:04:26,279 --> 02:04:34,500
chant with it and according to Herodotus

2882
02:04:30,119 --> 02:04:36,239
they screaming who is joy the hot box in

2883
02:04:34,500 --> 02:04:37,970
right there that's some old-school hot

2884
02:04:36,239 --> 02:04:41,460
box on just a couple thousand years ago

2885
02:04:37,970 --> 02:04:42,960
so hopefully yes we should always you

2886
02:04:41,460 --> 02:04:44,520
know and that also comes just with

2887
02:04:42,960 --> 02:04:46,409
ignorance when you don't know something

2888
02:04:44,520 --> 02:04:47,790
people saying oh you're a pioneer you've

2889
02:04:46,409 --> 02:04:49,439
been in this industry for four years

2890
02:04:47,789 --> 02:04:52,079
because I have to admit Tom I've heard

2891
02:04:49,439 --> 02:04:54,989
that as well but from my perspective I

2892
02:04:52,079 --> 02:04:58,079
and I honestly my natural natural

2893
02:04:54,989 --> 02:05:00,029
reaction to it was that I chuckled III I

2894
02:04:58,079 --> 02:05:02,699
wasn't offended at all I just thought

2895
02:05:00,029 --> 02:05:05,099
like oh it was just funny right because

2896
02:05:02,699 --> 02:05:07,349
it's like I know something they don't

2897
02:05:05,100 --> 02:05:08,700
and he can't be mad at them because they

2898
02:05:07,350 --> 02:05:11,120
don't know they're just coming in with

2899
02:05:08,699 --> 02:05:13,199
this really narrow slice of the pie but

2900
02:05:11,119 --> 02:05:15,359
potentially and we all started somewhere

2901
02:05:13,199 --> 02:05:19,079
in 40 or 50 years they could get to

2902
02:05:15,359 --> 02:05:21,420
where where a lot of us are and being in

2903
02:05:19,079 --> 02:05:38,789
a position to help educate the next

2904
02:05:21,420 --> 02:05:39,480
round of young ignorant box that are go

2905
02:05:38,789 --> 02:05:41,550
ahead sorry

2906
02:05:39,479 --> 02:05:43,199
alright not to but I was just saying

2907
02:05:41,550 --> 02:05:45,869
that I think the industry everything's

2908
02:05:43,199 --> 02:05:48,059
just changing so fast like I think it's

2909
02:05:45,869 --> 02:05:50,909
almost like a modern issue it's just

2910
02:05:48,060 --> 02:05:52,830
like what do we even know about two

2911
02:05:50,909 --> 02:05:55,579
years ago seems like forever ago you

2912
02:05:52,829 --> 02:05:58,769
know I mean on certain levels you know

2913
02:05:55,579 --> 02:06:00,659
pioneers google it so simple you know or

2914
02:05:58,770 --> 02:06:02,040
girls do know everything cuz all they

2915
02:06:00,659 --> 02:06:04,199
have to do is ask the question and they

2916
02:06:02,039 --> 02:06:07,109
can google it so it's like we don't need

2917
02:06:04,199 --> 02:06:08,239
elders anymore instant response and it's

2918
02:06:07,109 --> 02:06:10,009
it's very

2919
02:06:08,239 --> 02:06:11,779
automatic I feel like you know you have

2920
02:06:10,010 --> 02:06:13,369
a question you can have it answered well

2921
02:06:11,779 --> 02:06:15,859
that's a really symptomatic response

2922
02:06:13,369 --> 02:06:18,079
what are the roots that go all the way

2923
02:06:15,859 --> 02:06:20,299
down to that possible question and it is

2924
02:06:18,079 --> 02:06:22,850
a real issue with society today and I

2925
02:06:20,300 --> 02:06:24,710
would say this is an attempt industry I

2926
02:06:22,850 --> 02:06:27,620
mean two years ago is like a revelation

2927
02:06:24,710 --> 02:06:29,539
that you can get CBD isolate well now

2928
02:06:27,619 --> 02:06:32,090
it's a revelation that you just take the

2929
02:06:29,539 --> 02:06:33,890
THC out of it you know it's like oh you

2930
02:06:32,090 --> 02:06:35,420
just have seen the isolate oh that's a

2931
02:06:33,890 --> 02:06:39,200
thing in the past but we want the full

2932
02:06:35,420 --> 02:06:42,170
spectrum no THC or so my god whatever

2933
02:06:39,199 --> 02:06:43,609
that thing oh okay you know anyway I

2934
02:06:42,170 --> 02:06:47,480
think it's interesting out how fast

2935
02:06:43,609 --> 02:06:49,549
things are changing agreed it's deadly

2936
02:06:47,479 --> 02:06:52,909
oh man I have to ask you a question

2937
02:06:49,550 --> 02:06:54,440
please do it I saw your video about when

2938
02:06:52,909 --> 02:06:58,159
you went that you make and you were

2939
02:06:54,439 --> 02:07:01,879
looking for all the fields were you were

2940
02:06:58,159 --> 02:07:06,170
doing selections and you found that one

2941
02:07:01,880 --> 02:07:08,630
field where everything looked more

2942
02:07:06,170 --> 02:07:11,119
uniform and you were selecting the

2943
02:07:08,630 --> 02:07:14,690
female the best females do you still

2944
02:07:11,119 --> 02:07:16,159
have that seed I have I have most of

2945
02:07:14,689 --> 02:07:18,799
those seeds yeah I have seeds that go

2946
02:07:16,159 --> 02:07:22,550
way back before videos to from around 95

2947
02:07:18,800 --> 02:07:26,090
96 in Jamaica and so there was this

2948
02:07:22,550 --> 02:07:30,020
other guy that I worked that I talked to

2949
02:07:26,090 --> 02:07:35,420
in Oregon and he got this strain from

2950
02:07:30,020 --> 02:07:36,590
from Africa called Malawi I think it was

2951
02:07:35,420 --> 02:07:40,329
nice

2952
02:07:36,590 --> 02:07:43,730
Malawi yeah Malawi he said it's really

2953
02:07:40,329 --> 02:07:47,720
the most potent the only problem is it's

2954
02:07:43,729 --> 02:07:50,149
very late maturing so so he bought some

2955
02:07:47,720 --> 02:07:53,840
seeds and he's breeding it to be earlier

2956
02:07:50,149 --> 02:07:55,039
you know earlier maturing but I guess if

2957
02:07:53,840 --> 02:07:57,110
you're growing indoors that doesn't

2958
02:07:55,039 --> 02:07:59,420
matter right you can pretty much do that

2959
02:07:57,109 --> 02:08:03,679
with lights right yeah or if you're just

2960
02:07:59,420 --> 02:08:05,149
a tropical place like Jamaica it doesn't

2961
02:08:03,680 --> 02:08:08,420
what I was really impressed with that

2962
02:08:05,149 --> 02:08:11,029
video because that's exactly what plant

2963
02:08:08,420 --> 02:08:13,460
breeders do let her do native traits you

2964
02:08:11,029 --> 02:08:16,819
go to you go to a place like that and

2965
02:08:13,460 --> 02:08:20,060
you just you just start collecting stuff

2966
02:08:16,819 --> 02:08:21,569
you know and that field of all these

2967
02:08:20,060 --> 02:08:24,480
females that you share

2968
02:08:21,569 --> 02:08:26,819
that is like that's like that's what

2969
02:08:24,479 --> 02:08:29,219
turned me on to plant breeding just to

2970
02:08:26,819 --> 02:08:32,329
see the genetic diversity right in front

2971
02:08:29,220 --> 02:08:35,100
of your face and those were slightly

2972
02:08:32,329 --> 02:08:37,470
those were intimated right so they were

2973
02:08:35,100 --> 02:08:40,200
like a population absolutely

2974
02:08:37,470 --> 02:08:42,990
but they still had tons of diversity oh

2975
02:08:40,199 --> 02:08:45,449
yeah well Jamaica is this crazy inbred

2976
02:08:42,989 --> 02:08:49,109
Island of cannabis cultivars it's hard

2977
02:08:45,449 --> 02:08:50,639
to find those those those pure I I don't

2978
02:08:49,109 --> 02:08:54,469
want to say landrace cuz even they were

2979
02:08:50,640 --> 02:08:57,150
brought there from most likely India but

2980
02:08:54,470 --> 02:08:59,400
some of those older narrow leaf drug

2981
02:08:57,149 --> 02:09:01,199
cultivars those tall ones that's what I

2982
02:08:59,399 --> 02:09:02,879
was always looking for but of course

2983
02:09:01,199 --> 02:09:06,170
most of what you end up finding is the

2984
02:09:02,880 --> 02:09:09,119
short stacked single buds

2985
02:09:06,170 --> 02:09:12,329
turtle Jewett is talking about going

2986
02:09:09,119 --> 02:09:14,750
someplace and collecting teeth you can't

2987
02:09:12,329 --> 02:09:21,960
do that anymore that's illegal that's so

2988
02:09:14,750 --> 02:09:24,329
biopiracy actually there's enough

2989
02:09:21,960 --> 02:09:30,079
diversity now I think to keep us going

2990
02:09:24,329 --> 02:09:30,079
for a while that's not true

2991
02:09:30,380 --> 02:09:35,989
three-quarters of the people out there

2992
02:09:33,510 --> 02:09:41,640
will suppose was at least partially

2993
02:09:35,989 --> 02:09:45,179
collected but though it's not collecting

2994
02:09:41,640 --> 02:09:51,180
for disease resistance no it's the next

2995
02:09:45,180 --> 02:09:53,640
phase in cannabis we get apartment

2996
02:09:51,180 --> 02:09:56,789
because of population sizes maybe you

2997
02:09:53,640 --> 02:09:58,619
need for that and also because it's a

2998
02:09:56,789 --> 02:10:03,119
little bit more sophisticated breeding

2999
02:09:58,619 --> 02:10:05,340
than than just three yeah just go into

3000
02:10:03,119 --> 02:10:06,869
anyone's grow room and you can see that

3001
02:10:05,340 --> 02:10:10,079
people have not focused

3002
02:10:06,869 --> 02:10:12,239
disease resistant cultivars as of yet

3003
02:10:10,079 --> 02:10:14,970
sometimes you have to go back to really

3004
02:10:12,239 --> 02:10:17,429
wild stuff to get to get it because the

3005
02:10:14,970 --> 02:10:20,850
gene pool has been so bottle necked

3006
02:10:17,430 --> 02:10:22,829
but your teeth the exact opposite is

3007
02:10:20,850 --> 02:10:25,770
what's actually true since the

3008
02:10:22,829 --> 02:10:31,649
introduction of widely drug varieties

3009
02:10:25,770 --> 02:10:32,980
thank you thank you for I actually I

3010
02:10:31,649 --> 02:10:35,579
know a little bit

3011
02:10:32,979 --> 02:10:39,009
[Laughter]

3012
02:10:35,579 --> 02:10:41,229
when if you select for just drug types

3013
02:10:39,010 --> 02:10:44,230
that's what you're gonna get you know

3014
02:10:41,229 --> 02:10:47,969
well you know it's it's even different

3015
02:10:44,229 --> 02:10:52,839
than that that both the narrow leaf the

3016
02:10:47,970 --> 02:10:55,900
equatorial tropical narrowly drug

3017
02:10:52,840 --> 02:11:01,779
varieties then they have high resistance

3018
02:10:55,899 --> 02:11:02,289
to mold and powdery mildew and that kind

3019
02:11:01,779 --> 02:11:05,409
of stuff

3020
02:11:02,289 --> 02:11:07,000
whereas materials from Afghanistan up in

3021
02:11:05,409 --> 02:11:09,789
the mountains they don't have any

3022
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:12,010
resistance to it and when you bring them

3023
02:11:09,789 --> 02:11:15,130
down to areas where there are those

3024
02:11:12,010 --> 02:11:17,710
problems your implants and the hybrids

3025
02:11:15,130 --> 02:11:22,869
of those plants serious serious problems

3026
02:11:17,710 --> 02:11:24,609
with yeah that's for sure that's what we

3027
02:11:22,869 --> 02:11:26,109
can really listen to the plant and what

3028
02:11:24,609 --> 02:11:28,359
it is the genetics are telling us and

3029
02:11:26,109 --> 02:11:29,949
where the genetics have come from and I

3030
02:11:28,359 --> 02:11:32,049
do believe that lots of small-time

3031
02:11:29,949 --> 02:11:34,869
growers for a very long time have been

3032
02:11:32,050 --> 02:11:37,270
breeding for pesticide you know for pest

3033
02:11:34,869 --> 02:11:38,920
issues and for fungi issues for a very

3034
02:11:37,270 --> 02:11:40,900
long time so there are small breeders

3035
02:11:38,920 --> 02:11:42,489
out there they've been doing it a super

3036
02:11:40,899 --> 02:11:45,189
long time I realize that there may not

3037
02:11:42,489 --> 02:11:47,889
be like a large industry big breeding

3038
02:11:45,189 --> 02:11:49,839
but there are a lot of amazing varieties

3039
02:11:47,890 --> 02:11:51,369
out there that are totally resistant to

3040
02:11:49,840 --> 02:11:53,920
pests and fungi and they're going

3041
02:11:51,369 --> 02:11:56,559
through maybe hundreds of seeds you know

3042
02:11:53,920 --> 02:11:59,289
in their field a thousand and then they

3043
02:11:56,560 --> 02:12:01,690
go through and only pollinate the ones

3044
02:11:59,289 --> 02:12:03,220
that you know look the best I mean who's

3045
02:12:01,689 --> 02:12:04,960
gonna go into a plant and pollinate

3046
02:12:03,220 --> 02:12:07,210
something with powdery mildew all over

3047
02:12:04,960 --> 02:12:10,289
it I mean okay so it happens but I that

3048
02:12:07,210 --> 02:12:12,609
person is not really working with I

3049
02:12:10,289 --> 02:12:14,109
believe that those that those years of

3050
02:12:12,609 --> 02:12:15,969
expertise that people have been doing

3051
02:12:14,109 --> 02:12:18,339
you know in their small gardens does

3052
02:12:15,970 --> 02:12:22,150
play does have a play in the breeding

3053
02:12:18,340 --> 02:12:23,890
industry moving forward right well just

3054
02:12:22,149 --> 02:12:26,319
to give you a clue of what I mean by

3055
02:12:23,890 --> 02:12:28,770
diversity in order to find some traits

3056
02:12:26,319 --> 02:12:33,849
that I was looking for ice cream like

3057
02:12:28,770 --> 02:12:37,090
15,000 different accessions and found

3058
02:12:33,850 --> 02:12:39,940
one that had the fart lestrade I mean

3059
02:12:37,090 --> 02:12:42,130
still you'd have to make a commitment if

3060
02:12:39,939 --> 02:12:44,769
you want it if you want to do that

3061
02:12:42,130 --> 02:12:47,409
breeding and and I'm guessing the reason

3062
02:12:44,770 --> 02:12:49,870
the narrow leaf ones are

3063
02:12:47,409 --> 02:12:52,750
more disease-resistant to enjoy is cuz

3064
02:12:49,869 --> 02:12:55,599
air moves through the canopy better we

3065
02:12:52,750 --> 02:12:58,659
saw that and soybean you know like

3066
02:12:55,600 --> 02:13:01,539
there's narrow eat soybeans well it's

3067
02:12:58,659 --> 02:13:03,760
partly that and partly the other thing

3068
02:13:01,539 --> 02:13:07,539
is that they come from an environment

3069
02:13:03,760 --> 02:13:09,970
that's wet humid and hot and wet humid

3070
02:13:07,539 --> 02:13:12,939
and hot and if they don't have natural

3071
02:13:09,970 --> 02:13:16,930
resistance we're gonna see existence a

3072
02:13:12,939 --> 02:13:21,579
variety right powdery mildew is actually

3073
02:13:16,930 --> 02:13:24,100
pretty common in a lot of resistance

3074
02:13:21,579 --> 02:13:26,409
genes are not hard to find in a lot of

3075
02:13:24,100 --> 02:13:28,090
crops I don't know about I don't know

3076
02:13:26,409 --> 02:13:30,130
about cannabis yet because I never

3077
02:13:28,090 --> 02:13:32,890
looked for it but it should be easy to

3078
02:13:30,130 --> 02:13:37,000
find because it's an obligate parasite

3079
02:13:32,890 --> 02:13:40,590
it evolved with the plant it can only

3080
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:44,319
live on that plant and maybe one wild

3081
02:13:40,590 --> 02:13:47,529
other you know so when when you have a

3082
02:13:44,319 --> 02:13:49,719
situation like that the host develops

3083
02:13:47,529 --> 02:13:51,519
resistance genes very quickly so they're

3084
02:13:49,720 --> 02:13:55,829
there they're out there you just got to

3085
02:13:51,520 --> 02:14:01,210
look for them I have not seen very much

3086
02:13:55,829 --> 02:14:02,739
I've grown thousands thousands of Afghan

3087
02:14:01,210 --> 02:14:05,920
seeds that are important from

3088
02:14:02,739 --> 02:14:08,619
Afghanistan many different times and let

3089
02:14:05,920 --> 02:14:12,279
me tell you in general they have zero

3090
02:14:08,619 --> 02:14:14,949
resistance do they have do they all have

3091
02:14:12,279 --> 02:14:17,349
broad leaves yes of course

3092
02:14:14,949 --> 02:14:21,010
that's what I was saying it's the narrow

3093
02:14:17,350 --> 02:14:23,650
leaf itself if you have one plant

3094
02:14:21,010 --> 02:14:29,110
growing in the middle of a whole bunch

3095
02:14:23,649 --> 02:14:31,869
of narrow leaf plants that one gets

3096
02:14:29,109 --> 02:14:35,259
mildewy and all the rest of them no it's

3097
02:14:31,869 --> 02:14:38,380
not density it's not it's I mean what

3098
02:14:35,260 --> 02:14:40,480
you're saying is partly but that's not

3099
02:14:38,380 --> 02:14:44,260
the core reason the core reason is they

3100
02:14:40,479 --> 02:14:49,329
don't have any genetic resistance to

3101
02:14:44,260 --> 02:14:51,840
these also I think that we're seeing a

3102
02:14:49,329 --> 02:14:54,189
tremendous you know you know

3103
02:14:51,840 --> 02:14:55,750
non-resistant and variety of different

3104
02:14:54,189 --> 02:14:57,699
types of leaf mildews you know it's

3105
02:14:55,750 --> 02:14:59,090
really easy to say oh it's p.m. or oh

3106
02:14:57,699 --> 02:15:00,800
it's DM but

3107
02:14:59,090 --> 02:15:02,390
we're seeing a tremendous amount of

3108
02:15:00,800 --> 02:15:04,489
different types of mildews that are

3109
02:15:02,390 --> 02:15:07,220
landing on plants and I don't see it any

3110
02:15:04,489 --> 02:15:09,529
different than humans you know I see a

3111
02:15:07,220 --> 02:15:11,600
candida infection exactly the same

3112
02:15:09,529 --> 02:15:14,539
inside of a human as I would see on a

3113
02:15:11,600 --> 02:15:17,930
plant and we're seeing humans you know

3114
02:15:14,539 --> 02:15:19,880
much less of a healthy microbiome in the

3115
02:15:17,930 --> 02:15:21,980
same way that we're seeing unhealthy

3116
02:15:19,880 --> 02:15:24,199
microbiome in plants it has to do with

3117
02:15:21,979 --> 02:15:26,569
the toxicity whatever they're spraying

3118
02:15:24,199 --> 02:15:28,550
up in the atmosphere whatever is going

3119
02:15:26,569 --> 02:15:31,579
into our soils whatever is going into

3120
02:15:28,550 --> 02:15:33,230
the into the water systems is really you

3121
02:15:31,579 --> 02:15:35,510
know bringing down the immune response

3122
02:15:33,229 --> 02:15:38,209
and I think that that is something that

3123
02:15:35,510 --> 02:15:40,699
you know the reason why it's such a huge

3124
02:15:38,210 --> 02:15:42,500
conversation PM PM everybody that you

3125
02:15:40,699 --> 02:15:44,960
talk to in the industry is talking about

3126
02:15:42,500 --> 02:15:46,220
this there's a reason why it has to do

3127
02:15:44,960 --> 02:15:48,560
with genetics it has to do with

3128
02:15:46,220 --> 02:15:50,690
environment and it you know and it has

3129
02:15:48,560 --> 02:15:52,820
to do with the time that we're living

3130
02:15:50,689 --> 02:15:55,819
right now so we're seeing more and more

3131
02:15:52,819 --> 02:15:57,920
people affected in their microbiome or

3132
02:15:55,819 --> 02:15:59,719
soil affected in the microbiome and more

3133
02:15:57,920 --> 02:16:01,880
plants affected in the microbiome so we

3134
02:15:59,720 --> 02:16:03,949
have to be smarter than that we have to

3135
02:16:01,880 --> 02:16:05,779
clean up our act and we have to produce

3136
02:16:03,949 --> 02:16:08,119
genetics that are immune to these things

3137
02:16:05,779 --> 02:16:10,909
Sam were you able to produce any soils

3138
02:16:08,119 --> 02:16:15,289
or any ways to enhance the immune system

3139
02:16:10,909 --> 02:16:18,109
to create organic growing in general

3140
02:16:15,289 --> 02:16:21,470
biodynamic organic bread in general does

3141
02:16:18,109 --> 02:16:27,259
that really a lot but I'd like to repeat

3142
02:16:21,470 --> 02:16:32,300
that if I'm growing huge amounts of

3143
02:16:27,260 --> 02:16:36,909
narrow league plants do I grow a few the

3144
02:16:32,299 --> 02:16:36,909
Afghan ones do in with them and they

3145
02:16:37,479 --> 02:16:41,239
yeah they're like magnets for it for

3146
02:16:40,069 --> 02:16:42,770
sure I mean it does you don't really

3147
02:16:41,239 --> 02:16:44,420
have to be a plant breeder to understand

3148
02:16:42,770 --> 02:16:47,510
that one comes from a super dry arid

3149
02:16:44,420 --> 02:16:51,888
area and has never encountered powdery

3150
02:16:47,510 --> 02:16:55,190
mildew before and the other has grown in

3151
02:16:51,888 --> 02:16:59,029
in the tropical like super humid super

3152
02:16:55,190 --> 02:17:00,920
hot environment like where where if you

3153
02:16:59,030 --> 02:17:04,610
put an Afghan there just go to Jamaica

3154
02:17:00,920 --> 02:17:07,579
and see they put the O's Afghan and they

3155
02:17:04,610 --> 02:17:10,159
just get powdery mildew it's crazy

3156
02:17:07,579 --> 02:17:12,349
and we could say the same as somebody

3157
02:17:10,159 --> 02:17:12,559
who's been living up in Siberia they're

3158
02:17:12,349 --> 02:17:14,450
in

3159
02:17:12,559 --> 02:17:16,819
tire life and then bring them to the

3160
02:17:14,450 --> 02:17:18,470
tropics and what kind of things come out

3161
02:17:16,819 --> 02:17:20,360
of them you know what their body is

3162
02:17:18,469 --> 02:17:22,489
totally used to what their genetics are

3163
02:17:20,360 --> 02:17:24,409
used to and then it's it's really

3164
02:17:22,489 --> 02:17:27,171
amazing because I do work in large

3165
02:17:24,409 --> 02:17:30,020
clinics in in tropical areas and a lot

3166
02:17:27,171 --> 02:17:32,091
of the doctors or nurses or midwives

3167
02:17:30,020 --> 02:17:34,041
that come down into that area they get

3168
02:17:32,091 --> 02:17:36,020
really sick because they've been dealing

3169
02:17:34,040 --> 02:17:38,599
with like cold environment for a long

3170
02:17:36,020 --> 02:17:40,640
time and talk about all different types

3171
02:17:38,600 --> 02:17:42,649
of mildews and fungi that will come out

3172
02:17:40,639 --> 02:17:44,599
of them to be able to acclimate it's

3173
02:17:42,649 --> 02:17:48,710
amazing I don't see us any different

3174
02:17:44,600 --> 02:17:51,200
than the plants true that for sure I

3175
02:17:48,710 --> 02:17:53,119
definitely from traveling I saw it a lot

3176
02:17:51,200 --> 02:17:55,030
just people going to countries they've

3177
02:17:53,120 --> 02:17:57,591
never been to far-off countries and

3178
02:17:55,030 --> 02:18:02,329
picking up weird viruses weird little

3179
02:17:57,591 --> 02:18:04,341
little sicknesses and that's all because

3180
02:18:02,329 --> 02:18:06,501
of the microbiome and how much it

3181
02:18:04,341 --> 02:18:09,140
changes from region to region and that

3182
02:18:06,501 --> 02:18:11,569
microbiome is is inside of the genetics

3183
02:18:09,139 --> 02:18:14,001
it's inside of the seed as much as it

3184
02:18:11,569 --> 02:18:19,279
you know is resistant or non resistant

3185
02:18:14,001 --> 02:18:21,950
when it grows out into a clamp true

3186
02:18:19,280 --> 02:18:25,220
enough we'll [ __ ] two and a half hours

3187
02:18:21,950 --> 02:18:27,171
not too bad just gonna keep going you

3188
02:18:25,219 --> 02:18:36,859
want to call it a day what's how's

3189
02:18:27,171 --> 02:18:41,300
everyone feeling I'm good by this guy I

3190
02:18:36,860 --> 02:18:44,329
have to go check into my air B&amp;B ah the

3191
02:18:41,300 --> 02:18:45,889
air B&amp;B well I've texted mark to put us

3192
02:18:44,329 --> 02:18:47,421
in touch with one another I have some

3193
02:18:45,889 --> 02:18:52,099
more questions for I want to keep in

3194
02:18:47,421 --> 02:18:53,989
touch though guys yeah thanks for coming

3195
02:18:52,100 --> 02:18:56,120
and opening up the conversation it was a

3196
02:18:53,989 --> 02:18:57,619
good one nice to meet you hopefully we

3197
02:18:56,120 --> 02:18:59,780
meet on the flip side I have lots of

3198
02:18:57,620 --> 02:19:02,180
questions for you for sure it's gonna be

3199
02:18:59,780 --> 02:19:04,520
about two or three months before I'm in

3200
02:19:02,180 --> 02:19:07,809
Colorado so I gotta sell my house and

3201
02:19:04,520 --> 02:19:10,220
all that stuff but just be patient

3202
02:19:07,809 --> 02:19:12,710
Cali reach out to me and I'll I'll put

3203
02:19:10,219 --> 02:19:13,790

with everyone I did appreciate I just

3216
02:19:44,989 --> 02:19:48,500
you know what I appreciate not everyone

3217
02:19:46,489 --> 02:19:50,389
agreeing on everything I appreciate the

3218
02:19:48,500 --> 02:19:52,939
discourse you know being able to have

3219
02:19:50,389 --> 02:19:54,739
dialogue about different things and not

3220
02:19:52,939 --> 02:19:56,329
get upset and start calling each other

3221
02:19:54,739 --> 02:19:58,879
names but just have like an adult

3222
02:19:56,329 --> 02:20:00,260
conversation I mean I wish actually

3223
02:19:58,879 --> 02:20:02,000
Kuban would have come back in because

3224
02:20:00,260 --> 02:20:03,770
when we started the organics talk he was

3225
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:06,020
talking a lot about how he does not do

3226
02:20:03,770 --> 02:20:08,359
organics and he just had his own good

3227
02:20:06,020 --> 02:20:10,159
points that would have made I just think

3228
02:20:08,359 --> 02:20:11,960
it's okay for us to disagree and that's

3229
02:20:10,159 --> 02:20:14,000
kind of the biggest value here on hash

3230
02:20:11,959 --> 02:20:15,858
search in my opinion as you know Josh

3231
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,459
was saying this industry is changing so

3232
02:20:15,859 --> 02:20:19,068
fast

3233
02:20:16,459 --> 02:20:20,539
month after month after month that it's

3234
02:20:19,068 --> 02:20:23,239
pretty important to have a dialogue

3235
02:20:20,540 --> 02:20:24,890
going to let people kind of catch up and

3236
02:20:23,239 --> 02:20:27,100
keep up with what's going on and the

3237
02:20:24,889 --> 02:20:30,019
changes that are so consistent but I

3238
02:20:27,100 --> 02:20:31,670
want to thank all of you for coming out

3239
02:20:30,020 --> 02:20:33,140

3240
02:20:31,670 --> 02:20:35,750
people who are watching and listening

3241
02:20:33,139 --> 02:20:38,059
thanks a lot we'll see you next Sunday

3242
02:20:35,750 --> 02:20:44,290
if if I can make it happen

3243
02:20:38,059 --> 02:20:44,289
so thanks I would guess not a good one

3244
02:20:47,469 --> 02:20:51,438
he definitely had a little Michael

3245
02:20:49,700 --> 02:21:02,180
Keaton thing going on for sure

3246
02:20:51,439 --> 02:21:04,520

3247
02:21:02,180 --> 02:21:08,770
