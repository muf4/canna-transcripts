28
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:28,200
crazy okay I honestly did did they all

29
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:30,599

30
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:33,118
the latest one which is the

31
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:36,559
all right right d all right well let's

32
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:37,799
hit that super sweet these guys they've

33
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,960
uh you can't really tell but he's got

34
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:41,799
these real bulbous bases and the water

35
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:44,718
goes right into the bases as well I

36
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:46,880
really like that oh sturdy support too

37
00:01:44,718 --> 00:01:49,438
for eils it's got a solid base so you're

38
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:52,078
not tipping these guys over at all they

39
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:53,559
don't feel Tippy at all at at all at all

40
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:59,038
I think the one you have there is close

41
00:01:53,560 --> 00:02:00,759
to a 4 and 1/2 in base for a 7 in height

42
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:02,519
yeah that's about right

43
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:04,399
really nice too the way the ball is

44
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:06,718
stacked on top of the bottom piece and

45
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,919
the tube going down the middle with it's

46
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:12,000

00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:32,519
win definitely got to wear the shade

51
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:35,560
with this bright light on us I'm looking

52
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:37,719
pretty pasty right now on

53
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:40,840
video think I'm going to try some of the

54
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:43,000
rock that yeah yeah I think that's a

55
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,000
good

56
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:55,560
idea oh

57
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:58,759
[Music]

58
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:01,400
yeah what's that sound that's my

59
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:04,479
phone

60
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,480
I thought someone put some tunes

61
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:15,840
on Cheers hitting the rock

62
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:18,719
star nice I like the little pinky hold

63
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,799
on the carb cap I was talking to Corey

64
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:22,919
earlier about uh we're having an

65
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:25,799
interesting conversation in regards to

66
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:28,679
Innovation and what glass blowers face

67
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:31,840
in a world of being having to be very

68
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:33,840
careful that you don't bite someone's

69
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,438
style because style is one thing but

70
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,000
then there's you know certain welds or

71
00:03:36,438 --> 00:03:40,598
certain procedures that need to be done

72
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,598
techniques that can be shared and then

73
00:03:40,598 --> 00:03:45,839
you can apply your own style to and it's

74
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:49,000
difficult I'm sure as a glass blower not

75
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,598
wanting to bite on someone's style yet

76
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
seeing something that you think oh I

77
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:54,039
could really innovate something like

78
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,360
that use certain aspects and put them

79
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:58,519
into your own glass for sure it's that's

80
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:01,000
always uh always our biggest struggle is

81
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:02,438
to find your own voice voice with so

82
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
many glass blowers out there in the

83
00:04:02,438 --> 00:04:06,318
community right so I'm pretty stoked on

84
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,039
what I've been doing recently with the

85
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:10,919
new recyclers the cubic cyclers it's

86
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:13,878
different than what everybody's doing so

87
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:16,478
I'm I'm just happy to kind of set myself

88
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:18,199
apart I find even when you're doing

89
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:21,120
things that other people are doing you

90
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:22,560
still um stand well apart and and I'll

91
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,478
be really perfectly honest that one of

92
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,120
the first times I saw you know you had

93
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:29,000
this intense ratachello pattern on one

94
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:31,199
of those older tubes to me the only time

95
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,879
I had seen work that was that quality

96
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:36,280
was like Dosa MH like the Dosa tube and

97
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:39,560
people were like this is a $115,000 tube

98
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:41,359
and I was just like how much yeah it's

99
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:43,839
like Cory's got a bunch of those on his

100
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,439
desk right now like they look perfect

101
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:48,239
yeah yeah but you know as you moved into

102
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:51,918
this I personally have not seen a lot of

103
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,560
people doing this this is very unique I

104
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:56,198
love the

105
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,959
different shapes of the cans you know

106
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:59,360
we're going to get into your cubic ones

107
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:00,799
in a little bit here we're just sort of

108
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,000
going going starting with these ones

109
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,560
first but just the whole vibe of the

110
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,360
piece is so well put together and so

111
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,240
it's just got like a happy feel to it

112
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,879
than and as a photographer when I look

113
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,439
at the piece as

114
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:16,560
well it has almost a frightening level

115
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:19,000
of precision in how you've stacked you

116
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,600
know I look at these things very closely

117
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,879
when it comes to photography that's my

118
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,919
biggest uh pet peeve is having anything

119
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:26,478
off it it'll bug me for weeks and weeks

120
00:05:24,918 --> 00:05:28,159
so it's I don't know you got to put the

121
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:29,959
time in to get everything lined up and

122
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,400
straight well it's just a amazing that

123
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:34,359
you have the ability that you can even

124
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:36,079
do that because uh I don't think that

125
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,680
just anyone could do such a thing to be

126
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:40,198
able I mean I understand how working

127
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,240
glass happens and I understand what you

128
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:45,680
guys do to get this done and I I'm a

129
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,400
fairly capable person I find there's no

130
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,840
way I I look at a lot of people's

131
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:50,599
benches and they have really busy

132
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:52,599
backgrounds with stickers and posters

133
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,400
and everything everywhere MH I can't

134
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,080
work like that I kind of need like a

135
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:58,719
clear spot if you look in front of my

136
00:05:56,079 --> 00:06:00,399
bench I just have just the tin yeah so

137
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,160
it's clean there's no distraction so

138
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:04,519
when I'm lining stuff up I've got

139
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,720
nothing kind of distracting my eye like

140
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:09,598
only the pieces in frame that makes

141
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,000
Incredible sense in fact you could even

142
00:06:09,598 --> 00:06:13,519
take it to the next level where you

143
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,759
could have behind you

144
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:18,159
angles on the wall behind you imagine

145
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:20,800
having perfect some people will set up

146
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,880
mirrors and stuff so they can see yeah

147
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,520
what's going on well I mean it's part of

148
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:27,000
being the artist too it's it's the

149
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:29,519
artistic Endeavor it's the it's the

150
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,759
vision that allows you to get things so

151
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:34,318
so perfectly

152
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:36,319
symmetrical that I think there's a

153
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,199
Synergy that's created when you create a

154
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,479
piece that is so perfectly symmetrical

155
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:42,800
and none of the lines are off that you

156
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:46,120
get more than what all the pieces add up

157
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,759
to MH and uh I see that in in most of

158
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,918
the glass pieces that you've ever shown

159
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,800
me I don't know if you're hiding the

160
00:06:48,918 --> 00:06:53,439
broken and the shitty ones but like

161
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:56,918
everything you've ever shown me you

162
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:59,160
learn to to hide uh different defects

163
00:06:56,918 --> 00:07:00,799
here and there as you old like the glass

164
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,639
always always will throw curve balls at

165
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,520
you so it's how you you learn to roll

166
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:08,160
with it and and adapt to situations that

167
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:10,439
come up as as you're making a piece mhm

168
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,680
I also feel that when you do a

169
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:14,719
collaboration that it's also very

170
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,199
synergistic and it's always like you

171
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,120
know when I saw this piece I looked at

172
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:20,720
it I was like holy smokes like how did

173
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,959
he do that one and then it was like oh

174
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:26,400
this is a collaboration with Steve Steve

175
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:28,758
Steve Steve sections are always on point

176
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:31,000
always uh awesome working with his his

177
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:32,639
uh his work for sure well once again

178
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,079
being able to have someone to take your

179
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,478
work and to put it together in a way

180
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:41,000
that is so perfectly symmetrical I mean

181
00:07:37,478 --> 00:07:42,839
the piece is on point so many different

182
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,720
welds and so many little different

183
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:48,359
additional pieces that can go just the

184
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:50,599
slightest bit I would say maybe less

185
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:53,120
than a centimeter especially things like

186
00:07:50,598 --> 00:07:55,478
the to be off and to be noticeable

187
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,000
absolutely things like the can things

188
00:07:55,478 --> 00:08:01,120
like the the down stem and the and the

189
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,240
female you know where she plugs in mhm

190
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,680
it's beautiful dude I've got some more

191
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:08,158
size love sections coming I got uh some

192
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,439
torsos coming by him as well so look out

193
00:08:08,158 --> 00:08:12,199
for some more

194
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:14,279
collabs I think it's great I mean uh

195
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:16,280
when you guys can get to a level where

196
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:18,878
all of a sudden now it's about mailing

197
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:20,559
pieces to each other that is a you know

198
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,240
makes it that much easier and it just

199
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,959
opens up a whole new world of

200
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,680
possibilities of who you can work with

201
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:27,839
and absolutely when I first learned

202
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,560
about glass blowing and collaborations I

203
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:32,000
pictured a collaboration being two

204
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:33,440
blowers blowing next to one another and

205
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,958
they had to be next to one another and

206
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,000
they had to show each other the pieces

207
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:39,799
and the parts and that's just not the

208
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,759
case whatsoever the only downfall I find

209
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:43,918
is that you don't get to hold the piece

210
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:46,120
like Steve might not have a chance to

211
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:47,759
actually physically see this piece in

212
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,759
person so that's the only downfall I've

213
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:51,600
had some pieces that I've I've had a

214
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:53,559
part of and I'll never get to see it so

215
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,000
that's like a little heartbreaking but

216
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:56,439
besides that but then again you have

217
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,600
these surprises out there that are

218
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:00,680
potentially awaiting for you yeah who

219
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,720
knows down the road I might come come

220
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:04,479
come into that's definitely got to be

221
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,000
one of the bonuses of the glass blower

222
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,759
where you have people that are excited

223
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,440
to meet you they've collected a piece

224
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:12,679
from your past and they're also excited

225
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,240
when meeting you to show you that piece

226
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:16,159
hey check this out I think it was Max

227
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,680
Poland who just posted a piece the other

228
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:20,719
day that someone popped by from his past

229
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:22,799
and he was like yeah yeah that's always

230
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,200
the best feeling for sure

231
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:27,559
absolutely well very cool dude I'm just

232
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,440
loving all the colors on these really

233
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:31,759
really lovely different color sequen is

234
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,240
I can only imagine how you go about is

235
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:36,039
it really straight like I'm just going

236
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:39,159
to do a purple one no sometimes I I'll

237
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:41,399
pace for a couple hours even before I I

238
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:44,399
start the day sometimes it's like I'll

239
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:47,000
grab colors and xay the colors and keep

240
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:49,159
going back to my palette and not happy

241
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,200
and I don't know sometimes that's a big

242
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:52,919
struggle is just getting started and

243
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,560
having a game plan are you using colors

244
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:56,519
in the sense of pulling them out and

245
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:59,479
using them in your mind or you taking

246
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:03,399
colored glass out and laying it down got

247
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:05,278
if you you could take a shot of uh my my

248
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:07,440
uh Supply downstairs but I have all my

249
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:10,759
color tube laid down so I can see it all

250
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,920
and it's just I kind of just look look

251
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:14,720
for the uh the right

252
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:16,879
combinations well you're definitely

253
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,680
nailing it on combinations dude it's

254
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:21,799
crazy to have as many I think uh there's

255
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:24,759
somebody who wants to say hi here come

256
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:27,919
up and say hello to the camera

257
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:30,879
dude this is my this is my boy Sage you

258
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:32,319
want to say hi Sage in the house

259
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:34,120
checking it out we're talking about

260
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,920
daddy's work we're talking about his

261
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:40,440
artistic vision and it's it's incredible

262
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:42,278
really I can't I mean it's easy for me

263
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,320
to just look at and go yeah I like these

264
00:10:42,278 --> 00:10:46,039
color sequences I'm just not quite sure

265
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,800
that I would you know be able to go over

266
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:49,799
to the glass and be like yeah I need

267
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:52,599
this red and this particular kind of

268
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:55,519
yellowish and green sort of color it's

269
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:57,839
pretty incredible it's always I want to

270
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,839
kind of make new new combinations all

271
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:02,160
the time too so it's EAS easy to just

272
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:04,639
keep going for that same color pattern

273
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:06,919
right that works but it's like I don't

274
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:10,120
know it's hard to to to come up with the

275
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:11,479
new ideas all the time the new new uh

276
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:13,600
I'm having tongue tie right here I was

277
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:16,639
up too way too early this morning no but

278
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:19,040
I get 5 a.m. fishing I I my brain

279
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:20,839
because you know for me I do these

280
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:22,319
little videos and at the end I might

281
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:24,560
edit something that says thanks for

282
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,959
watching yeah and I always just turn

283
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:30,399
thanks red and for gold and watching

284
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:32,759
Green and green it's a color pattern I

285
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,720
know that works but I always want to

286
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:37,360
change it up and I'm like man like I

287
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,320
don't have the vision to continually

288
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,919
pull and that's a simple you know just

289
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:44,240
words on a screen I can't even imagine

290
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:46,919
because this is so much more

291
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:49,159
committed yeah you're deeply committed

292
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:50,319
colors and then you get uh two days into

293
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:51,799
a piece and then you're like wait a

294
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,680
minute I don't even like these colors

295
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:55,159
this looks like crap to me and that's

296
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:58,120
what I'm saying but then I don't know

297
00:11:55,159 --> 00:12:00,240
some people sorry and then uh you'll

298
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:02,639
you'll uh you'll find some people love

299
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,200
those pieces the best right some of some

300
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:07,039
of the work that you hate yourself

301
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:09,000
you'll people will just love it colors

302
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:10,919
and yeah I I have it as a photographer

303
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
all the time I only share what I think

304
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:15,559
is is great but the odd time I've done

305
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,078
the experiment of sharing something I

306
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:20,879
really didn't like it gets the the

307
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:22,638
reception of people in oh certain people

308
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:25,078
really enjoy that or like that the way

309
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:27,240
it looks it appeals to them so it kind

310
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:28,919
of shows you the the differences in all

311
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,959
of the people out there in the world

312
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:33,319
there's so many of us that as long as

313
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:35,439
you make it nice there's always going to

314
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:39,040
be someone that loves that particular

315
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:40,959
pattern that sequ style style

316
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:42,159
exactly very cool I wouldn't mind

317
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:44,679
getting a little bit of footage of you

318
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:46,078
on the uh on the torch yeah we can uh

319
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:48,759
definitely do that I'm working on

320
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:51,000
another recycler that I'm just uh

321
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:52,480
changing the shapes a little bit uh

322
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,320
trying something new so we'll see how

323
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,519
that works out well yeah let's go check

324
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,120
that out and then we'll come back we'll

325
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:00,839
clear these out and we'll do the uh

326
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,839
cubic uh recy

00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,680
that's the newest uh recycler I'm

330
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:39,919
working on just kind of switching up the

331
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:41,879
shape a little bit and just kind of

332
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:46,039
experimenting see what

333
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:46,039
works very hopefully we have a

334
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:53,040
winner I'd be amazed if you

335
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:57,319
didn't so now I'm just uh I'm going to

336
00:13:53,039 --> 00:14:00,120
get two holes ready to open to meet up

337
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:01,879
with the holes that I have up for the uh

338
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:06,799
the return

339
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:09,000
okay or not the return up for the perk

340
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:10,000
uh what do you call that what would you

341
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,360
call

342
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,879
that return it would be the perk but it

343
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:18,159
would be the uptake I guess yeah so uh I

344
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:19,958
can't keep up with all the I'm getting

345
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:22,078
ready to make two two arms that are

346
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:24,518
coming out from this this hole that I'm

347
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:27,879
about to open up to this side and the

348
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:30,519
same on the opposite side I uh with my

349
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:33,078
cubic cycl I usually keep it under the

350
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:35,759
bus and for the most part I find I have

351
00:14:33,078 --> 00:14:40,039
a lot more cracking issues with uh these

352
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:43,470
shapes right then with uh just straight

353
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:44,679

everything up and keeps it all happy a

359
00:14:54,958 --> 00:15:00,679
lot easier and faster than I could here

360
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:04,159
on like you can do the same thing and

361
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:06,120
kind of like go into a bushier flame and

362
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:08,559
I've just kind of got used to working

363
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:11,198
this way for these guys it just see

364
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:13,679
feels safer for me I like to make it to

365
00:15:11,198 --> 00:15:13,679
the end of my

366
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:26,120
pieces just got

367
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:26,120
this point where I want to

368
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,600
go

369
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,879
it just blow it out without popping a

370
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:48,039
hole and then I'll do the same to the

371
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:49,720
other side try to line them up as close

372
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:53,078
as I can to the

373
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:55,959
same into the same area everything looks

374
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:55,958
symmetrical at the

if I need to do any adjusting from one

380
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:39,599
hole if they're not exactly even I can

381
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:43,680
just speed up and kind of blow one side

382
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:47,519
out to notch the other side blew those

383
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:47,519
little bubbles right out hey

384
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:02,040
yeah makes it really easy

385
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:04,119
uh when I'm going to tear it open I can

386
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:06,199
heat that whole spot out that I blew a

387
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:08,759
really thin and it'll go to a really

388
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:11,640
flat and it'll leave me with a perfect

389
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:13,679
opening if I pop it and peel it at the

390
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:15,880
right time right so then when I go to

391
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:19,280
ream and open it just saves me a lot of

392
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:19,280
work it's a lot cleaner

you can see it opened up pretty pretty

396
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:51,000
uh pretty nice there it's got a nice uh

397
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:53,960
ground opening I won't have to mess with

398
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,880
it too much I might just peel off this

399
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:58,558
one little spot that's got a little bit

400
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:01,520
of a thicker uh section just for I

401
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:01,519

even that

bad

409
00:18:41,558 --> 00:18:48,158
to so now with that hole open I'll go

410
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:51,038
and rip a a hole open on the top and get

411
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:53,240
that ready for connection and then once

412
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:56,400
I have both those holes open I'll grab

413
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:59,120
my my uh tube that I have and then I'll

414
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,280
just bend it into the shape that I want

415
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:03,879
I'll get two bent at the same time so I

416
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:07,119
can match the bend and then I'll connect

417
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:09,440
one while I have the two two openings

418
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:12,319
work those in and then it Go repeat the

419
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:15,600
process on the other side and then do

420
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:15,599
the exact same thing it's

421
00:19:16,558 --> 00:19:21,000
incredible so this one I can't blow like

422
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:24,480
I did the other one so I just have to

423
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,349
peel it open right now with that one

424
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,240
hole already

[Music]

426
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:34,000
open I just get it to where it's flat

427
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:34,000
like it was and and it's

428
00:19:35,558 --> 00:19:39,710
uh

429
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:42,910
just peel it to where it's

all right not quite as bright now we

447
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:17,200
just uh Cory did a little bit of glass

448
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:20,640
blowing showed us his bench and now we

449
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:23,360
are back here looking at the cubic

450
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:25,679
recyclers yeah the cubic orbs and the

451
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:27,839
cubic cyclers oh okay right yeah the

452
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:30,038
cubic or these three are the cubic orbs

453
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:30,038
uh

454
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:34,918
these are the more the simplified

455
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:35,599
version little less work than some of

456
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:39,880
the

457
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:39,879
others uh these guys retail at

458
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:47,080
two wow is that ever nice

459
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,760
though lot of water in that bottom

460
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:52,199
chamber I love to see that I'm kind of

461
00:21:48,759 --> 00:21:54,519
not really a big fan of the half uh you

462
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,798
know it's just to give uh distance from

463
00:21:54,519 --> 00:22:00,278
the drain it's like the internal

464
00:21:56,798 --> 00:22:02,240
drain so so to give enough distance from

465
00:22:00,278 --> 00:22:05,000
where the perk to the drain is and to

466
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:08,960
avoid it shooting up the center yep oh

467
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:11,519
totally otherwise uh I've switched up

468
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:16,079
the design on these uh these guys here

469
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:17,839
to uh add the cleine aspect to it all

470
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:20,678
right so this just like gives it a

471
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:23,038
further distance to travel and did you

472
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:25,320
do that with an orb one or did you just

473
00:22:23,038 --> 00:22:27,400
change the shape of this up top and uh

474
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:31,839
the first one that I did the clein

475
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,840
switches see the difference was this one

476
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:39,798
here snagging you a bit it's a gra

477
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:41,839
grapping hook here make not glowing so

478
00:22:39,798 --> 00:22:47,679
yeah this was the first one that I uh

479
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:47,678
tried the clein return right

480
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:56,960
beautiful is that

481
00:22:54,679 --> 00:22:59,960
one

482
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,960
there

483
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:09,319
wow that's really chuggy mhm it's a

484
00:23:05,278 --> 00:23:11,440
deeper deeper hole Yeah Yeah those

485
00:23:09,319 --> 00:23:13,240
beautiful yeah I really like these well

486
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,240
I mentioned it on a numerous occasion I

487
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:17,000
love the the square shaping I love the

488
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:19,720
circular shaping I love just different

489
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:23,038
shapes other than the standard can yes

490
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:24,919
as do I you know as for the reason for

491
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:26,319
the exploration of uh the different

492
00:23:24,919 --> 00:23:28,000
shapes and how to throw them all

493
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:30,000
together together and make them look

494
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,919
really nice right it's almost like from

495
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,519
the bottom up you know minus this base

496
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,400
that you've got that standard can in

497
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:38,519
there but then to just throw this on top

498
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:41,400
of it is really super styly and and

499
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:43,720
elegant yeah I like the concave so you

500
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:45,919
can sink the ball down a lot lower so

501
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:47,759
it's not sitting up like these guys for

502
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,759
the cube they the ball sits that much

503
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:51,359
higher on the piece oh right and I like

504
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:53,519
the way that the ball just kind of tucks

505
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:55,479
in it makes it like that a little more

506
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:57,440
sleeker I like that as well actually

507
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:59,919
like the ball sitting in the a cup

508
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:02,200
almost yeah this one as well which is

509
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:03,440
the one that we've been hitting uh you

510
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:06,038
were saying the retail on these ones

511
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:08,798
were around uh that one would be

512
00:24:06,038 --> 00:24:12,200
35

513
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:14,918

514
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:16,798

515

519
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:28,278

523
00:24:31,798 --> 00:24:35,519
