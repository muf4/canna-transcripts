to really explain to the viewers at home

112
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:59,758
if you haven't

113
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:02,600
before you know been up for the the

114
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,479
first day on the mountain you see this

115
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:07,360
is very

116
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:10,159
dark there we go I'm going to make this

117
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,400
sort of the best we

118
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,720
can oh there we go that's a little bit

119
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:18,839
better we want to be on the Gula on puff

120
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:20,319
Wednesday who doesn't exactly I mean

121
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:23,598
it's where I want to

122
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,319
be so let's get this fortunately for us

123
00:06:23,598 --> 00:06:25,839
we

124
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:29,919
are

125
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:33,159
yes we are indeed now it's time for some

126
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:35,079
quick moving because let's be honest

127
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,759
we're only going to have so much time

128
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:38,719
before we get up to Mid station that's

129
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:42,759
right and if we have a full-blown giant

130
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:44,759
pipe sticking out of my Gondola while we

131
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:46,598
get up there it could be problematic I

132
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:49,319
mean we do like to

133
00:06:46,598 --> 00:06:51,240
respect Whistler black home you know to

134
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:52,400
a degree they have some they have some

135
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,759
pretty good rules that are worth

136
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:57,839
following safety things and such Safety

137
00:06:54,759 --> 00:07:00,080
First safety first but at the same time

138
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:01,758
we're not going to not enjoy a little

139
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:03,598
well I mean let's be realistic that

140
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,840
would just be ridiculous really indeed

141
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:06,639
so we brought this little guy here on

142
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:09,279
the

143
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:12,598
Gonda I did forget

144
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:14,679
water which is fine we can hit it light

145
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:16,279
see if my wife's going to NE non-stop

146
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,680
hit me up on my phone now I don't think

147
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:21,799
you want beer in your bong otherwise I

148
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:25,360
could help you oh yes look at

149
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:27,478
this oo look made that last night that

150
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,000
looks little Teflon and some Platinum

151
00:07:27,478 --> 00:07:32,560
Girl Scout cookies crossed with a Wi-Fi

152
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,519
43 so let's hope that when we pull this

153
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,079
off it doesn't just break cuz that would

154
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:39,000
be the best and it

155
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:40,120
didn't all right this going to be a

156
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,839
pretty big

157
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:45,038
rip what we're

158
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:48,000

162
00:07:53,158 --> 00:07:57,038
break but not really it was dumping when

163

506
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:21,439
here just above tokm if you're familiar

507
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:23,240
with tokm on Whistler blackholm it is a

508
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:26,240
run do you realize we're right here

509
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:27,839
Patty yeah we're just uh still on like

510
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,278
basically almost you know just around

511
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:30,599
the corner from Dave Murray downhill

512
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:33,919
well I say we take the advice of that

513
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:35,278
sign and Tok him Tok him let Tok him so

514
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,759
you can see right here so this is Dave

515
00:25:35,278 --> 00:25:40,000
Murray no Dave Murray continues on that

516
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:42,480
to the right yeah like just up over here

517
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,599
to the right all of this is Dave Murray

518
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,360
well I think this or it stops this part

519
00:25:44,599 --> 00:25:48,639
is technically because it's steeper

520
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:50,278
right like that's easy this looks steep

521
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,919
this is and then it carries on that

522
00:25:50,278 --> 00:25:55,159

1009
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:57,440
just because of the [ __ ] that he does he

1010
00:53:55,400 --> 00:54:00,160
has built up his core muscles within his

Ryan who is uh was supposed to meet me

1302
01:09:35,399 --> 01:09:39,399
up on the mountain today uh it was a pow

1303
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:42,239
day no friends that's pretty much he was

1304
01:09:39,399 --> 01:09:43,759
up in line at 6:30 or 6 o00 yeah

1305
01:09:42,238 --> 01:09:44,759
somewhere around there yeah that's

1306
01:09:43,759 --> 01:09:46,759
pretty

1307
01:09:44,759 --> 01:09:49,158
ridiculous so yeah we're just going to

1308
01:09:46,759 --> 01:09:51,640
finish finish it off here in his cozy

1309
01:09:49,158 --> 01:09:53,838
Creek Side pad thought I'd come by and

1310
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:56,280
uh offer a couple of dabs up to him cuz

1311
01:09:53,838 --> 01:09:58,719
uh while he had great powder today but I

1312
01:09:56,279 --> 01:10:00,119
doubt that he had great dabs this is

1313
01:09:58,719 --> 01:10:03,359
true

1314
01:10:00,119 --> 01:10:05,719
right so let's get you a great

1315
01:10:03,359 --> 01:10:07,479
dab let's hope for the torch this torch

1316
01:10:05,719 --> 01:10:09,600
was giving us a hell of a time on the

1317
01:10:07,479 --> 01:10:12,119
mountain today trying to trying to start

1318
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:13,920
it it was just like it get cold and the

1319
01:10:12,119 --> 01:10:16,479
little Flint inside would no longer

1320
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:19,600
Flint so we were using

1321
01:10:16,479 --> 01:10:22,039
lighters just to light the gas just to

1322
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:23,840
get it lit yeah the the clicking the

1323
01:10:22,039 --> 01:10:26,000
clicking was doing nothing click click

1324
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:27,440
click click so yeah fair enough

1325
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:29,439
and we also didn't have water in the

1326
01:10:27,439 --> 01:10:31,039
pipe all day we hit it dry the entire

1327
01:10:29,439 --> 01:10:32,238
day so this is my first session with

1328
01:10:31,039 --> 01:10:34,158
this pipe and I've been puffing out of

1329
01:10:32,238 --> 01:10:35,799
it since this morning with Patty

1330
01:10:34,158 --> 01:10:39,000
actually got Patty doing some good dabs

1331
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:41,320
today nice yeah yeah all I had to do was

1332
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:43,920
put a couple of pints in them before 10

1333
01:10:41,319 --> 01:10:45,439
yeah there you go he was and it's on

1334
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:49,279
yeah

1335
01:10:45,439 --> 01:10:54,079
exactly which is uh yeah good experiment

1336
01:10:49,279 --> 01:10:56,439
for Mountain practical dab gear right

1337
01:10:54,079 --> 01:10:58,679
yeah that's what I'm feeling

1338
01:10:56,439 --> 01:11:01,119
I just love it dude I definitely don't

1339
01:10:58,679 --> 01:11:03,679
feel that it uh you know hinders me in

1340
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:05,359
any way I have a little dab I sit for 5

1341
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:07,000
or 10 minutes and then I just get out

1342
01:11:05,359 --> 01:11:09,839
into the snow and it just feels like

1343
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:12,679
pretty much the greatest thing

1344
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:14,480
ever isn't that about how you see it oh

1345
01:11:12,679 --> 01:11:16,560
yeah here this one's going to be yours

1346
01:11:14,479 --> 01:11:17,839
Bud all about the greatest thing ever

1347
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:20,760
it's very hot so I think we're going to

1348
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:22,520
wait about 20 seconds or 30 seconds till

1349
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:23,760
that quartz cools down on the mountain

1350
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:25,520
it was also giving me a hard time

1351
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:28,440
because the quartz would take on the co

1352
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:29,800
of outside so so I'd be torturing it

1353
01:11:28,439 --> 01:11:31,479
thinking I was heating it up and then

1354
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:33,640
I'd go to put the oil in and it wouldn't

1355
01:11:31,479 --> 01:11:35,919
even like melt yeah so I was like damn I

1356
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:37,520
think I need to uh and of course at one

1357
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:40,239
point we had like six people waiting for

1358
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:42,320
a dab so I'm like Oh my and this thing's

1359
01:11:40,238 --> 01:11:44,238
like click click click click click but

1360
01:11:42,319 --> 01:11:46,799
not lighting yeah that was pretty

1361
01:11:44,238 --> 01:11:50,119
[ __ ] ridiculous I think you're

1362
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:53,239
good big one medium one Whatever

1363
01:11:50,119 --> 01:11:56,039
whatever he says

1364
01:11:53,238 --> 01:11:58,519
whatever little carb cap action right

1365
01:11:56,039 --> 01:12:00,840
there so nice to cruise around Whistler

1366
01:11:58,520 --> 01:12:03,800
and be able to blaze my buddies down

1367
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:03,800
truly truly

1368
01:12:05,238 --> 01:12:14,198
nice the carb cap worked damn

1369
01:12:09,439 --> 01:12:14,198
fine excellent put that there get my

1370
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:22,840
Q-tips make sure I got those

1371
01:12:18,119 --> 01:12:26,679
Q-tips which clean the bowl real

1372
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:29,880
nice and relax

1373
01:12:26,679 --> 01:12:33,279
right yeah that was a good

1374
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:35,359
dab oh good day nothing wrong with that

1375
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:37,880
at

1376
01:12:35,359 --> 01:12:40,158
all yeah you know it's been uh well how

1377
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:43,920
long you been living up in whis for now

1378
01:12:40,158 --> 01:12:47,279
it's almost 10 years okay and think of

1379
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:50,239
how many of those years were 30 foot

1380
01:12:47,279 --> 01:12:53,519
years that went into 40 that went into

1381
01:12:50,238 --> 01:12:55,678
50 it was only probably about 3 years

1382
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:58,000
last year was good not great I'd say the

1383
01:12:55,679 --> 01:13:00,960
first four I was here probably maybe

1384
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:03,359
even five we borderline epic 50 Footers

1385
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:05,560
yeah and then we had the last three I

1386
01:13:03,359 --> 01:13:08,399
know we not so awesome last year started

1387
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:13,400
to try a little harder but still only

1388
01:13:08,399 --> 01:13:16,399
got us into like even K couple of storms

1389
01:13:13,399 --> 01:13:18,198
yeah but we're off to a good start we

1390
01:13:16,399 --> 01:13:19,638
really are and we have that weather

1391
01:13:18,198 --> 01:13:21,599
pattern like it was when I first got

1392
01:13:19,639 --> 01:13:24,440
here where it's rainy all summer and

1393
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:25,840
that so exact instead of it being hot so

1394
01:13:24,439 --> 01:13:28,359
hopefully that that

1395
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:30,199
will happen exactly like it did before

1396
01:13:28,359 --> 01:13:34,119
and fill the valley in with

1397
01:13:30,198 --> 01:13:34,119
snow one can only

1398
01:13:34,198 --> 01:13:39,279
hope little OG cush TPS we have to give

1399
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:42,679
you a TP dab you'll have to have one on

1413
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:12,119
was already on the mountain I heard

1414
01:14:10,119 --> 01:14:13,399
people lined up last night oh yeah

1415
01:14:12,119 --> 01:14:15,679
people were

1416
01:14:13,399 --> 01:14:17,799
definitely were even at creek side but

1417
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:20,399
people would have been at the uh The

1418
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:22,800
Whistler one for sure quite a few a day

1419
01:14:20,399 --> 01:14:24,479
or two before yeah apparently started

1420
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:27,360
they were there for about 12 hours last

1421
01:14:24,479 --> 01:14:28,599
night yeah all the way through I've done

1422
01:14:27,359 --> 01:14:30,319
that a few times you got to love the

1423
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:34,079
commitment listen what you guys used to

1424
01:14:30,319 --> 01:14:37,158
do was beyond cool actually hiking the

1425
01:14:34,079 --> 01:14:38,920
mountain sleeping overnight like to me

1426
01:14:37,158 --> 01:14:40,638
that's and then getting a peak laap

1427
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:42,639
that's kind of some of the [ __ ] that is

1428
01:14:40,639 --> 01:14:44,440
special that I hope to never see leave

1429
01:14:42,639 --> 01:14:46,400
Whistler because that's the roots that's

1430
01:14:44,439 --> 01:14:48,119
the culture that's like what makes

1431
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:49,679
Whistler special and sure it's also like

1432
01:14:48,119 --> 01:14:51,599
oh you could get in trouble oh you could

1433
01:14:49,679 --> 01:14:53,079
have your I mean yeah of course but it's

1434
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:55,400
not like what you guys are doing is

1435
01:14:53,079 --> 01:14:57,600
dangerous it's it's just a really cool

1436
01:14:55,399 --> 01:14:59,479
thing that I've always thought was

1437
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:01,840
pretty much epic climbing the mountain

1438
01:14:59,479 --> 01:15:03,839
before it opens and just the next day

1439
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:07,560
waking up and rolling down like first

1440
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:09,920
tracks that is and see the sunet or

1441
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:11,960
Sunrise up there handset yeah I can't

1442
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:13,158
imagine cuz like I said I've never I've

1443
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:16,000
never had that

1444
01:15:13,158 --> 01:15:18,599
