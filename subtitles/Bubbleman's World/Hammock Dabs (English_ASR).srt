106
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,800

00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:32,918
shangrala hotel actually no sour

113
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:34,639
from the hotel kapulsky in Amsterdam

115
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,519

117
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:39,758

118
00:05:42,038 --> 00:05:48,079
bottle I don't know about you guys but

119
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:52,120
I'm a big fan of drinking water out of

120
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:56,240
glass not a big plastic fan at all all

121

123
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:05,000
TP sift that it is and this is one of

124
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:08,120
the dangers of using parchment paper is

125
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,959
once it ages and potentially Butters

126
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:14,800
out um you're in a situation where it

127
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:19,719
really pops off the parchment I'm going

128
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,720
to do okay here but here we

129
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:25,400
go couple of patties I could I could

130

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,439
it's on a whole other uh level when

170
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,598
Horatio is trying to explain that these

171
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:31,519
tpin that he's capturing are the ones

172
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:33,759
that you never even taste because

173
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:36,679
they're gone from your bud by the time

174
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:37,879
you've dried it it's it's a very hard

175
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:40,918
thing to wrap your head around but I'll

176
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:44,038
tell you once you take a rip of

177
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:46,879
it you get it pretty quick oh that's

178
00:08:44,038 --> 00:08:49,838
real nice real

179
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:53,039
nice so I think uh I'll put the Seven

180
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:56,720
Star aside for a second

181
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:59,639
here that all closed up folded up

182
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:02,800
safely and then

183
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:02,799
I thought we'd do a little dab of the

184
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,600
LH A little dab of the

185
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:14,399
L straight sap as

186
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:14,399
always

187
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:18,440
sappy it's that sappy

188
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:23,519
papy all

189
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:26,600
right got nothing but the sound of PLS

190
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:30,200
and birds in the air today I'll tell you

191
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,200
ples and birds

192
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,680
just the smallest amount of wind up here

193
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:40,959
it's really quite beautiful I can't wait

194
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:43,838
to uh lay my head back and get the most

195
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:43,838
of this kayak

196
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,959
experience still looking forward to that

197
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,480
day where we can come up with a torch

198
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:54,000
that shows us the temperature of the of

199
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:58,519
the substance that we're heating whether

200
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:00,919
we're heating uh glass or titanium uh

201
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:04,200
ceramic

202
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:06,599
uh the carbide the the silicon carbide

203
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,640
whatever source that you're hitting uh

204
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,560
it would be great to know the

205
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:12,559
temperature it would be great to be able

206
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:15,078
to know for a fact okay you know it's at

207
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:18,278
500 it's at 550 stop now I don't want to

208
00:10:15,078 --> 00:10:19,919
have to go to 1,000 or 900 and then wait

209
00:10:18,278 --> 00:10:22,159
for a certain amount of time so I know

210
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:24,000
that the hit is is there that's not

211
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:26,240
really what I want to

212
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,440
do give this a little clean one of the

213
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,959
things I love about torching though is

214
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,880
uh that you can clean

215
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:34,559
you can clean it right clean so it's the

216
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:36,679
freshest of the fresh hits each time and

217
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:39,759
with a nail inevitably what happens is

218
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:41,838
you kind of get lazy and you sort of

219
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:44,439
allow that nail to build up and before

220
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,600
you know it you're uh well you're in a

221
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,760
situation where your nail has more

222
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,159
buildup than it should have so quartz is

223
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:52,720
nice like that with the torch all right

224
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:55,078
so I will let this cool down quite a bit

225
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:58,720
more than I did with the hash I find

226
00:10:55,078 --> 00:11:01,879
Hash hitting it soon after you torch uh

227
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,920
gives a beautiful hit not hot at all oil

228
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:05,559
however is quite hot when you hit it off

229
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:08,078
too hot of a nail so it's good to wait a

230
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:08,078
little bit of

231
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:35,399
time B

232
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:37,920
beautiful well with that

233
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:40,519
said and with that done I think I'm

234
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:42,120
going to relax and enjoy the hammock so

235
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:46,200
thanks for watching Bubble man's world

236
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:46,200
and we will catch you guys next

237
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,240
time for

238
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
for

239
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:02,078
for for

240
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,320
all

241
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:19,990
