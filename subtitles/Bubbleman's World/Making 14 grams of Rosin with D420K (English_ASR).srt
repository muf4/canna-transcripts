00:00:19,579 --> 00:00:24,989
hey guys welcome to bubble man's world

3
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:28,800
I'm here with Dee 420k sitting in

4
00:00:24,989 --> 00:00:30,839
beautiful lions baby sea and we're about

5
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,489
to get it done today aren't we yeah

6
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:33,988
we're gonna we were playing around a

7
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:35,578
little bit yesterday we kind of filmed a

8
00:00:33,988 --> 00:00:38,039
little bit of a video but my neck was

9
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:39,570
completely tweaked out slept on at the

10
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:42,390
wrong way and we ended up having to kind

11
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:44,909
of I had to just put the video on hold

12
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:47,429
and say another time so this is our

13
00:00:44,909 --> 00:00:49,378
second attempt at it yeah we made some

14
00:00:47,429 --> 00:00:53,189
nice rosin yesterday I know we did there

15
00:00:49,378 --> 00:00:55,109
was it's nice hey you know we did it's

16
00:00:53,189 --> 00:01:02,128
pretty sticky right you gotta hit it in

17
00:00:55,109 --> 00:01:03,689
the freezer a bit but so I kind of

18
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:05,450
thought after doing what we did

19
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:07,908
yesterday I thought of the idea of

20
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:12,320
wouldn't it be cool to show people

21
00:01:07,909 --> 00:01:15,450
pressing hash pressing rosin out of hash

22
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:19,019
but in more than a gram or two of an

23
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:21,150
amount so we don't have the industrial

24
00:01:19,019 --> 00:01:24,239
presses we're not even actually doing

25
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:27,240
the teabag folding yet we're still doing

26
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:29,069
the original Jeff Church wrapping a

27
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:31,048
little bit of hash you know maybe like

28
00:01:29,069 --> 00:01:32,879
less than a half gram into a ball and

29
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:35,368
then squeezing that out

30
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:37,259
onto parchment paper and we were going

31
00:01:35,368 --> 00:01:39,868
to see how long it takes us to do an

32
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:42,118
ounce of rosin yeah see what we get out

33
00:01:39,868 --> 00:01:47,180
of it yeah so I've got a couple of

34
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:47,180
ounces of some pretty darn nice oh wow

35
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:56,320
so that's powdered bubble right there I

36
00:01:53,760 --> 00:02:00,100
found because finally when you brought

37
00:01:56,319 --> 00:02:05,228
it over yeah oh my goodness just from

38
00:02:00,099 --> 00:02:06,939
sitting in the Sun night Wow work with

39
00:02:05,228 --> 00:02:08,859
at least a it should be easy to work

40
00:02:06,939 --> 00:02:10,389
with so basically what we're gonna do is

41
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:12,970
take you through this you can see here

42
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:15,219
on the scale I've got just under 2

43
00:02:12,969 --> 00:02:16,539
ounces fifty five point six fifty five

44
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:18,759
point eight grams

45
00:02:16,539 --> 00:02:20,469
it's very nice bubble that presses

46
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:23,679
between the fingers quite beautifully

47
00:02:20,469 --> 00:02:27,009
and bubbles and melts and nicely in a

48
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,750
bowl or on the nail but today we're

49
00:02:27,009 --> 00:02:30,989
going to uh we're gonna press it up so

50
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:33,370
do you want to just kind of get started

51
00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:36,700
make sure you don't contaminate yeah

52
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:39,700
okay yeah we got our pads here for once

53
00:02:36,699 --> 00:02:41,409
yep we've got our tools we're short on

54
00:02:39,699 --> 00:02:44,169
table doubles so we're gonna use these

55
00:02:41,409 --> 00:02:46,568
for Davin here they torch a clean and

56
00:02:44,169 --> 00:02:49,059
then carry on because we don't want to

57
00:02:46,568 --> 00:02:50,738
contaminate the rows with anything and

58
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:52,330
in this color I need darkness or

59
00:02:50,739 --> 00:02:53,769
anything cuz it just take away the

60
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:56,950
beautiful of it it's true

61
00:02:53,769 --> 00:02:58,569
well footwell cheers bro I need to grab

62
00:02:56,949 --> 00:03:01,089
my dad sorry you're go ring they're

63
00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:02,199
hopeless right there I think the whole

64
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:06,099
thing if you want we got the whole thing

65
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:12,389
there okay thanks buddy

66
00:03:06,099 --> 00:03:12,389
Cheers ting don't try that at home

67
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:34,420
so I'm hitting off the titanium D nail I

68
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:38,029
believe it's a highly educated with a

69
00:03:34,419 --> 00:03:46,189
sapphire insert I've got the crystal

70
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:47,180
quartz 14-inch insert 20 on the ball B

71
00:03:46,189 --> 00:03:55,009
beautiful

72
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:57,140
well it seems it seems to be I'm only

73
00:03:55,009 --> 00:03:58,489
gonna turn mine on a little bit

74
00:03:57,139 --> 00:04:00,889
differently I'm using a very small unit

75
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:03,110
so I also want to show you today that

76
00:04:00,889 --> 00:04:05,449
you don't need industrial units that you

77
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:07,340
don't need the biggest tools to still be

78
00:04:05,449 --> 00:04:08,419
able to press a decent amount of rosin

79
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,259
and that's kind of what we wanted to

80
00:04:08,419 --> 00:04:11,659
show you here

81
00:04:09,259 --> 00:04:13,519
now obviously Darren's about the bigger

82
00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:15,289
tool so he'd probably be able to press a

83
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:17,540
little bit of a bigger piece and get

84
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:20,389
more out of it I'm using quite a small

85
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:26,990
tool but I bet you we still get this

86
00:04:20,389 --> 00:04:27,800
done within a half an hour no I don't

87
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:29,900
think so

88
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:41,139
all right well I guess we're just I

89
00:04:29,899 --> 00:04:44,750
can't believe this Wow ve a beautiful

90
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:55,849
see I'm just doing small amounts half to

91
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:57,410
four 2/3 of a gram you can tell when

92
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:58,960
you're squeezing it when you're not

93
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:02,080
getting anything out of it anymore

94
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:02,079
[Music]

95
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:13,330
all right making rosin

96
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:19,759
come on takes a little bit of a maybe

97
00:05:17,779 --> 00:05:22,039
like less than a minute to heat up

98
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:25,939
I usually still do a bit of a press I

99
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:38,110
find that just gears it up for a a good

100
00:05:25,939 --> 00:05:43,939
proper pressing we've got some nice SAP

101
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:58,370
you sure here that one this little ball

102
00:05:43,939 --> 00:06:00,860
of baby I'm sure that's not gonna you

103
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:03,009
always wanted to produce a little more

104
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:07,699
don't you go what are you going to chuck

105
00:06:03,009 --> 00:06:09,289
because it usually does it sure can

106
00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:12,469
yeah that one just squeezed out a little

107
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:14,390
bit more fire mostly it's gonna be me

108
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:17,540
and Darren shooting the [ __ ] they're

109
00:06:14,389 --> 00:06:19,959
gonna rip every once in a while and get

110
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:22,520
as much of this work done as possible

111
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:26,649
it's slow yeah it's fairly consistent

112
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:26,649
work so as long as you're

113
00:06:39,160 --> 00:07:41,859
[Music]

114
00:07:45,199 --> 00:08:20,449
[Music]

115
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:30,089
it's sure nice when you've got great

116
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:32,720
quality resin to work with I think it's

117
00:08:30,089 --> 00:08:35,339
another reason to probably what you can

118
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:39,710
hold back on the temperature a little

119
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:39,710
bit because the

120
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:16,290
[Music]

121
00:09:12,828 --> 00:09:21,838
good fun making rasen with your buddies

122
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:24,078
out on your deck was that cool down for

123
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:27,120
that

124
00:09:24,078 --> 00:09:29,758
that looks mushy to you notice any

125
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:32,339
difference yes the color my last sheet

126
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:34,769
you had was literally like dark orange

127
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:41,970
compared to that looks like water she

128
00:09:34,769 --> 00:09:43,799
wasn't steady I'll just look this is the

129
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:46,399
sketchiest I go out where I actually was

130
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:50,188
holding it I've seen that and that's red

131
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:52,078
so I don't think it's what makes sense

132
00:09:50,188 --> 00:09:54,629
that that heat is going to affect the

133
00:09:52,078 --> 00:09:57,958
resin and the degradation of the

134
00:09:54,629 --> 00:10:09,420
cannabinoids we know that THC degrades

135
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:12,419
into CBN from CBN in there oh yeah when

136
00:10:09,419 --> 00:10:17,370
it comes off in a huge crazy sheet sheet

137
00:10:12,419 --> 00:10:19,019
about death holy sheet so I know there's

138
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:22,318
a couple of products soon to hit the

139
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:25,049
market there's the rasa nadir which is a

140
00:10:22,318 --> 00:10:27,479
pneumatic press I believe and then he

141
00:10:25,049 --> 00:10:29,188
now also has a product coming out as

142
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:31,980
well so I'll be able to do reviews of

143
00:10:29,188 --> 00:10:33,028
both those products and I thought before

144
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,889
they got here

145
00:10:33,028 --> 00:10:38,220
I thought what better way to show

146
00:10:34,889 --> 00:10:40,860
without rushing just the speed of what a

147
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:43,199
couple of guys can do sitting down and

148
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:45,959
pressing out some nice resin just with a

149
00:10:43,198 --> 00:10:49,818
couple of you know a really small hair

150
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:49,818
strainer and a large hair straightener

151
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:57,869
globs

152
00:10:55,649 --> 00:11:00,259
as producing globs ladies and gentlemen

153
00:10:57,869 --> 00:11:00,259
blobs

154
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:07,860
it's amazing how after I turn this thing

155
00:11:04,558 --> 00:11:10,350
off it stays hot for like I'd say five

156
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:14,550
or ten minutes I think just enough time

157
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:17,790
for me to take a big Ripple's nothing

158
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:30,899
that we made though it's the freshy yeah

159
00:11:17,789 --> 00:11:34,759
that's all right I'm hitting this on the

160
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:34,759
sapphire disk love this thing

161
00:11:53,409 --> 00:12:02,059
that was lovely so yeah like I was

162
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:04,759
saying the D mail unit and the rasa

163
00:12:02,059 --> 00:12:08,419
nadir unit I probably should have within

164
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:10,750
the next couple of weeks and we'll come

165
00:12:08,419 --> 00:12:14,269
back and we'll show you just how fast

166
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:17,539
you can press out an ounce of rosin with

167
00:12:14,269 --> 00:12:19,669
an industrial pneumatic press compared

168
00:12:17,539 --> 00:12:21,679
to you know these small little units but

169
00:12:19,669 --> 00:12:24,439
I really wanted to show you guys I mean

170
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:26,959
you can see right here right said I've

171
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:29,900
already trust a decent tiny amount oh

172
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:37,879
wait I don't real quick must be a few

173
00:12:29,899 --> 00:12:39,199
grams here anyway it's like 0.6 of a

174
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:43,879
grandma probably not hard to believe

175
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:45,770
that looks like a lot of rosin you know

176
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:52,629
what these all these things are

177
00:12:45,769 --> 00:12:57,519
different way that probably maybe a gram

178
00:12:52,629 --> 00:13:01,789
we're getting there 28 times more to go

179
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:05,389
you got another little bit there and as

180
00:13:01,789 --> 00:13:07,509
soon as this lets me i'll get it going

181
00:13:05,389 --> 00:13:15,590
yields are just yet

182
00:13:07,509 --> 00:13:18,850
they seem fairly decent just keep adding

183
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:18,850
them to this to this sheet

184
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:31,580
so easy to clean off the pail it easy to

185
00:13:28,769 --> 00:13:31,579
clean on forever

186
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:57,740
they're small

187
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:59,450
somewhat easy before I do that I guess

188
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:02,350
I'm gonna do another Barbara there's all

189
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:02,350
this rosin stuff right

190
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:36,260
and you must have a Wacka hash in there

191
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:57,550
see this hash still has residue I can

192
00:14:53,500 --> 00:15:04,470
tell the way it's acting so what's going

193
00:14:57,549 --> 00:15:04,469
right back here right back in she goes

194
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:11,769
[Music]

195
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:21,870
got close to four or five grams here

196
00:15:54,798 --> 00:15:59,788
like when it's just nice and lined up

197
00:15:58,019 --> 00:16:03,538
and not trying to move too much in the

198
00:15:59,788 --> 00:16:05,098
room the paper mm-hmm but this thing is

199
00:16:03,538 --> 00:16:12,359
so hot I'm gonna have to take a little

200
00:16:05,099 --> 00:16:16,349
bit of a break I'll probably do a lot of

201
00:16:12,359 --> 00:16:19,589
this video in fast-forward you know what

202
00:16:16,349 --> 00:16:27,089
I mean like put on a song and just show

203
00:16:19,589 --> 00:16:29,389
all us in like wait fast-forwarding

204
00:16:27,089 --> 00:16:29,389
again

205
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,758
it's good though you know because I hear

206
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:21,639
a lot of people say oh I don't like Roz

207
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:24,909
and it all tastes like vape lead I think

208
00:17:21,638 --> 00:17:27,188
that it's that person where it's the

209
00:17:24,909 --> 00:17:30,250
worrisome factor of like I want to make

210
00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:32,380
sure I get it all and there's that worry

211
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:35,288
that sometimes pushes through and

212
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:36,700
actually can commune razzin where it dry

213
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:38,558
sifting works that way you want to try

214
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:40,450
and get it all well good luck bro you

215
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:42,638
know I want to do is get the best of it

216
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:43,679
all you want to get it all well that's

217
00:17:42,638 --> 00:17:53,099
different

218
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:53,100
like very different patients

219
00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:36,778
[Music]

220
00:18:45,779 --> 00:18:56,589
single squeeze that was a very efficient

221
00:18:50,140 --> 00:19:05,860
squeeze you just never know when you're

222
00:18:56,589 --> 00:19:09,459
gonna get one like that yeah I got most

223
00:19:05,859 --> 00:19:16,859
everything out of that in one one little

224
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:16,860
rip I squeeze on that one just heavenly

225
00:19:23,339 --> 00:19:27,459
man does this pick up wild almost like

226
00:19:26,589 --> 00:19:31,839
taffy

227
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:34,900
it's just that perfect now it's going

228
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:38,849
back to more like normal but first few

229
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:38,850
pieces picked up select

230
00:20:23,869 --> 00:20:28,589
might look a little dark on the sheet

231
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:32,940
but it'll press out nice and golden

232
00:20:28,589 --> 00:20:35,730
don't you worry all right so you've had

233
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:38,460
a nice little small improvement on our

234
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:40,799
technique here I had had my wife bring

235
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:43,650
up these little clips or clips for

236
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:45,119
keeping bags closed we have longer ones

237
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:47,990
that we were using these little ones are

238
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:54,809
perfect for keeping the pressing screen

239
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:57,329
twisted nice you know when you've

240
00:20:54,809 --> 00:21:21,450
pressed most of it out here's when it

241
00:20:57,329 --> 00:21:24,750
just comes out I love being able to look

242
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:35,279
into the paper and watch the house use

243
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:37,349
out we also find the smaller you use

244
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:40,950
like there's no envelope we talked about

245
00:21:37,349 --> 00:21:49,559
before with the smaller that I'm using

246
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:52,200
working with it the better I can and

247
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:55,649
with these clips your resin doesn't seem

248
00:21:52,200 --> 00:22:00,000
to climb up yeah or at least as it does

249
00:21:55,650 --> 00:22:01,710
you can control it better that's one

250
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:14,220
thing I was just literally noticing

251
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:18,029
online but I can control that off nice

252
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:20,220
little collections like decent amounts

253
00:22:18,029 --> 00:22:25,069
for these little well just less than

254
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:29,789
half gram balls that I'm putting in what

255
00:22:25,069 --> 00:22:33,539
know trying to keep an eye on our mounts

256
00:22:29,789 --> 00:22:35,940
here first 15 grams we we collected

257
00:22:33,539 --> 00:22:37,829
about 13 grams so somewhere along the

258
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:40,080
lines we lost two or two or three grams

259
00:22:37,829 --> 00:22:42,000
I'm not sure if it was because he was

260
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:43,769
heating it too hot earlier and steaming

261
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,980
it and we had quite a bit of grease on

262
00:22:43,769 --> 00:22:49,559
quite a few in the paper that was able

263
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:55,319
to get cleaned up but valid I bet that

264
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:58,259
we've got close to 10 grams now 7 8 9

265
00:22:55,319 --> 00:23:00,869
we're probably closing in on 10 grams

266
00:22:58,259 --> 00:23:03,509
which is about a third of the way there

267
00:23:00,869 --> 00:23:05,789
we've been at it for about you close to

268
00:23:03,509 --> 00:23:10,529
an hour now wouldn't turning the camera

269
00:23:05,789 --> 00:23:14,190
off yeah so we'll see if we can't double

270
00:23:10,529 --> 00:23:16,859
our our productivity and see if we can't

271
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:19,400
hammer off the next you know just under

272
00:23:16,859 --> 00:23:19,399
20 grams

273
00:23:28,808 --> 00:23:41,778
just a little job I suppose little suits

274
00:23:37,429 --> 00:23:43,038
to go along with it does especially when

275
00:23:41,778 --> 00:23:51,130
you're trying to talk on camera and

276
00:23:43,038 --> 00:23:51,129
stuff dick just monster dabs coffees

277
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:58,290
[Music]

278
00:24:00,778 --> 00:24:17,380
yes this is very good well I went and

279
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:22,149
left my thing on here so it's gonna take

280
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:24,370
me a few minutes to let it cool off it's

281
00:24:22,148 --> 00:24:27,268
very rewarding work when you're making

282
00:24:24,369 --> 00:24:30,250
it it's really not that hard labor wise

283
00:24:27,269 --> 00:24:32,980
you could do this job while sitting and

284
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:34,750
watching movies with your buddies we can

285
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:37,808
just as easily been sitting in front of

286
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:39,609
the big screen TV and you know watching

287
00:24:37,808 --> 00:24:41,798
YouTube videos while we hammer this out

288
00:24:39,609 --> 00:25:00,158
it's not really like I would call it a

289
00:24:41,798 --> 00:25:03,158
hard work patience is what it takes the

290
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:05,830
bubble hush and Lovejoy sift and dry

291
00:25:03,159 --> 00:25:09,778
sifting more so but this is pretty

292
00:25:05,829 --> 00:25:13,178
famous baking ly you know tedious and

293
00:25:09,778 --> 00:25:13,869
small going but rewarding it's very

294
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:17,379
rewarding

295
00:25:13,869 --> 00:25:20,109
really yeah when you think about it like

296
00:25:17,378 --> 00:25:21,609
when you think about the Cameo 10grams

297
00:25:20,109 --> 00:25:24,699
that we've made and probably a little

298
00:25:21,609 --> 00:25:26,258
bit over an hour that's not too bad

299
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:28,960
especially considering we're using the

300
00:25:26,259 --> 00:25:30,038
most you know the smallest of tools we

301
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,230
haven't used anything that's

302
00:25:30,038 --> 00:25:34,269
commercialized or industrialized by any

303
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:36,548
means not t-shirt press and we're just

304
00:25:34,269 --> 00:25:38,950
using I mean I'm really using literally

305
00:25:36,548 --> 00:25:41,319
the smallest tool that you could

306
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:44,319
possibly use and I just pressed out four

307
00:25:41,319 --> 00:25:47,109
or four and a half grams of rosin just

308
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:49,359
in the span of this video and I've got

309
00:25:47,109 --> 00:25:51,069
more left in me we're gonna well we're

310
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:53,949
gonna continue down this road until

311
00:25:51,069 --> 00:25:57,668
we've got ourselves a nice twenty-eight

312
00:25:53,950 --> 00:26:00,600
gram a nice ounce slab of rosin for you

313
00:25:57,669 --> 00:26:00,600
guys to look at so

314
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:12,470
just gotta fill these things up parent

315
00:26:09,019 --> 00:26:18,639
fill these slicks up with rosin and

316
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:18,640
we'll be done okay

317
00:26:19,329 --> 00:26:25,099
because who sits down and rips off an

318
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:29,660
ounce of roll of rosin with hair

319
00:26:25,099 --> 00:26:31,789
straighteners it's absurd we do yes we

320
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:36,769
do and I'm sure there's other people out

321
00:26:31,789 --> 00:27:17,299
there doing it as well to those people

322
00:26:36,769 --> 00:27:19,069
who are flying right now yeah it would

323
00:27:17,299 --> 00:27:25,099
be amazing if we could put all of this

324
00:27:19,069 --> 00:27:28,759
in one single pouch and just go and just

325
00:27:25,099 --> 00:27:30,949
have like you know 20 grams just reeked

326
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:32,539
out the sides into like little

327
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:34,340
containers and then literally just be

328
00:27:32,539 --> 00:27:36,678
like boom okay that's how we're doing it

329
00:27:34,339 --> 00:27:40,428
nowadays and that will be how we're

330
00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:42,670
doing it I guarantee you within weeks if

331
00:27:40,429 --> 00:27:42,670
not

332
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:58,650
that temperature drop we did lose a

333
00:27:56,910 --> 00:28:03,920
little bit of temperature from the Sun

334
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:03,920
going behind not that I'm complaining

335
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:20,089

336
00:28:50,579 --> 00:29:03,609
bonk yes okay how's the cat runs fine

337
00:29:00,669 --> 00:29:15,309
the dog jumps up to chase it they're all

338
00:29:03,609 --> 00:29:16,808
just playing their parts takes a little

339
00:29:15,308 --> 00:29:23,618
longer than we thought we'd been at it

340
00:29:16,808 --> 00:29:25,148
for a well over an hour now so a couple

341
00:29:23,618 --> 00:29:25,808
of hours we ended up getting about a

342
00:29:25,148 --> 00:29:28,118
half ounce

343
00:29:25,808 --> 00:29:29,950
yeah we're just under a mouse bones

344
00:29:28,118 --> 00:29:31,269
right now so we figured we'd have a

345
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:34,119
couple of bowls with you guys

346
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:41,339
squeeze out maybe a few more of these

347
00:29:34,118 --> 00:29:44,558
each just to get that last little bit we

348
00:29:41,339 --> 00:29:48,158
just experienced this is with his

349
00:29:44,558 --> 00:29:50,490
smaller one the resin has somewhere to

350
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,490
go to

351
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:58,190
to the wider one there's not as far of a

352
00:29:56,359 --> 00:30:00,199
distance to go to unless you use it a

353
00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:02,960
great big chunk like mania

354
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:05,179
ground-to-ground when we were talking

355
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:09,200
last night my buddy was saying he's he

356
00:30:05,179 --> 00:30:14,240
does 7 grams squeeze on it

357
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:15,880
7 grams 7 grams really so that's

358
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:21,380
interesting

359
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:24,520
listen I'm not sure no I just know what

360
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:28,010
kind of tool is eases hair straighteners

361
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:30,440
right the same way it's just it's going

362
00:30:28,009 --> 00:30:33,759
for the big yields just cure yeah no

363
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:33,759
mess not messing around

364
00:30:43,210 --> 00:31:00,679
yep that was the whole purpose of it I

365
00:30:45,769 --> 00:31:07,009
got to doing this squeeze that last time

366
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:11,059
that you know there's something that's a

367
00:31:07,009 --> 00:31:14,509
nice little unit right let's turn light

368
00:31:11,058 --> 00:31:19,298
on again let's just throw it to the

369
00:31:14,509 --> 00:31:26,298
first everything it says it's 365 365

370
00:31:19,298 --> 00:31:28,970
392 419 and 455 that's way too hot well

371
00:31:26,298 --> 00:31:31,339
let's go down to 365 the lowest one oh

372
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:33,440
is that the lowest one yeah wow that's

373
00:31:31,339 --> 00:31:35,269
pretty one that's pretty one that you

374
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:38,380
won't have my problem is that yeah I

375
00:31:35,269 --> 00:31:38,379
think so right

376
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:46,710
yeah but then again you could fix that

377
00:31:44,099 --> 00:31:48,480
problem by simply turning it on and then

378
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:50,788
just turning it off as it gets a little

379
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,829
bit too long I'm sure you'd find the

380
00:31:50,788 --> 00:31:55,589
super sweet spot on that thing and be

381
00:31:52,829 --> 00:31:59,308
like if you had you know I'm gonna go

382
00:31:55,589 --> 00:32:01,980
buy a new one that's digital that I can

383
00:31:59,308 --> 00:32:02,428
control the temperature completely there

384
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,750
we go

385
00:32:02,429 --> 00:32:05,700
well if you get one of these small ones

386
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:07,500
you'll be forced to do the turn it off

387
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:11,130
yeah that's so well that's what I want

388
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:13,230
to do the digital because I'm I'm a

389
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:20,669
turn-on kind of guy and just leave it on

390
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:24,329
yep you know I can still like feel how

391
00:32:20,669 --> 00:32:28,850
hot that is I turned it off like yeah

392
00:32:24,329 --> 00:32:31,849
that's hot man but it's hot

393
00:32:28,849 --> 00:32:31,849
yes

394
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:39,420
and you go grab the rest of the rosin

395
00:32:45,059 --> 00:32:50,679
there's a little bit for you guys at

396
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:54,130
home to see so far what we've got nice

397
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:56,110
little puck o rosin quite lovely little

398
00:32:54,130 --> 00:33:01,690
color on it not sure how well you guys

399
00:32:56,109 --> 00:33:04,109
can see that but caramely and very

400
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:04,110
strong

401
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:57,429
lovely you doing one more Caesar I bet

402
00:33:55,240 --> 00:34:00,329
you between what you squeeze there would

403
00:33:57,429 --> 00:34:00,330
I hear

406
00:35:00,269 --> 00:35:02,269
Oh

407
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:13,110
at least we're getting to the 14 mark or

408
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:16,380
you know halfway what we kind of hoped

409
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:18,539
we would get to but yeah actually

410
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:20,519
surprising whereas we figured we figured

411
00:35:18,539 --> 00:35:29,969
we'd be done in 40 minutes to an hour it

412
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:37,009
would exquisite amounts but do it we can

413
00:35:29,969 --> 00:35:37,009
do it today I got something we go eat

414
00:35:42,170 --> 00:36:02,670
that's good idea - I think we'll

415
00:35:45,480 --> 00:36:04,889
probably do a part two it's hard to beat

416
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:08,039
right here man reduce when I think of

417
00:36:04,889 --> 00:36:12,920
all the places we could do it at I think

418
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:12,920
I can picture us back here doing it

419
00:36:14,599 --> 00:36:21,150
maybe finish them off on the water with

420
00:36:17,219 --> 00:36:26,549
a big sash that sense of a plan right

421
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:29,309
there sure let me just squeeze another

422
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:32,330
couple of points out on the Roger I'm

423
00:36:29,309 --> 00:36:32,329
just doing another point

424
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:59,450
well let's see if this isn't enough

425
00:36:56,989 --> 00:37:08,839
right here I have a sneaking suspicion

426
00:36:59,449 --> 00:37:10,699
that's going to be an eagle dirtbiking

427
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:13,550
from here you just go behind your host

428
00:37:10,699 --> 00:37:15,439
via the trail yeah just go hide it

429
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:17,330
behind my house still a little up the

430
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,470
street the street goes up and around

431
00:37:17,329 --> 00:37:23,840
behind my house here

432
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:25,759
no suppose you go further no there's

433
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:28,010
water and some trails and stuff go up

434
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:30,050
there plus we have all sorts of trails

435
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:31,070
along liance Bay in other parts of the

436
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:33,140
area

437
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:35,390
yeah we have three different hikes that

438
00:37:33,139 --> 00:37:46,279
go up to the Lions one goes up to Mount

439
00:37:35,389 --> 00:37:49,969
Brunswick this stuff was so nice and and

440
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:53,720
soft and we're cool and I was just hard

441
00:37:49,969 --> 00:38:03,069
and crumbly that Sun sure does a job

442
00:37:53,719 --> 00:38:03,069
while I was on for sure you monster

443
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:16,139

445
00:38:16,139 --> 00:38:21,960
the least in this part I will show the

446
00:38:19,829 --> 00:38:24,779
slab I'll get some photos of this and

447
