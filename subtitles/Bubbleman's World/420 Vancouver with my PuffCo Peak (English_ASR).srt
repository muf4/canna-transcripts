oriented from your lessons

187
00:15:10,179 --> 00:15:13,599
[Music]

188
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:30,999
now we're gonna do this in a very

189
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:33,009
organized fashion so nobody gets

190
00:15:30,999 --> 00:15:35,139
trampled and nobody gets hurt

191
00:15:33,009 --> 00:15:37,300
all righty that proves that we're really

192
00:15:35,139 --> 00:15:39,220
really high but we're still capable of

193
00:15:37,299 --> 00:15:41,289
doing something like this without

194
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:42,670
anybody getting hurt so this is how we

195
00:15:41,289 --> 00:15:45,938
do it every year

196
00:15:42,669 --> 00:15:47,259
okay everybody that ground has been dry

197
00:15:45,938 --> 00:15:49,838
there's only been a little bit of

198
00:15:47,259 --> 00:15:52,720
drizzle on all day so the ground is dry

199
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:55,329
we need a pathway that goes right from

200
00:15:52,720 --> 00:16:00,790
the middle all the way to the first tip

201
00:15:55,328 --> 00:16:03,368
there and then we need a path down with

202
00:16:00,789 --> 00:16:05,409
joints even come walking out the first

203
00:16:03,369 --> 00:16:13,209
thing you're gonna do is make a path so

204
00:16:05,409 --> 00:16:15,730
I need some foam head to organize back

205
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:17,888
that way take everybody take two steps

206
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:21,100
back that way we need a path that goes

207
00:16:17,889 --> 00:16:28,688
all the way to the end all the way to

208
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:31,808
the end down the middle and

209
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:39,259
