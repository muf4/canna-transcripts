of you that don't know we basically took

8
00:00:21,649 --> 00:00:26,750
a four-month hiatus there at the request

9
00:00:24,589 --> 00:00:29,000
of YouTube I lost my ability to stream

10
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:31,278
I'm very very happy that they gave it

11

back I want to welcome everyone into the

12
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:35,890

00:00:34,009 --> 00:00:39,079
be here and so stoked to see all these

17
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:51,709
the people who are waiting this morning

18
00:00:48,289 --> 00:00:53,030
for the link to come in and spend a

19
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:54,410
little bit of time with us today we're

20
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:56,210
just gonna do a couple of hours I think

21
00:00:54,409 --> 00:00:59,358
depending on the conversation but I'm

22
00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:01,730
very very very excited to be back at

23
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,980
hash Church I missed it I swear as much

24
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:06,439
as you guys did there's a special thing

25
00:01:03,979 --> 00:01:08,119
that we have here and it's it was it was

26
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:10,730
kind of sad when I thought I was gonna

27
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:13,460
lose my ability to stream forever I was

28
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:16,370
in a 90-day probation on YouTube and

29
00:01:13,459 --> 00:01:18,289
after 90 days I went to stream and they

30
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:20,060
did not let me stream after a hundred

31
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:22,190
days they did not let me stream and it

32
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:24,469
kept going on and on and on but I was

33
00:01:22,189 --> 00:01:28,519
relentless and persistent and I kept

34
00:01:24,469 --> 00:01:30,980
checking every single day to see if if

35
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:32,659
we could get if we could get back on and

36
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:33,980
there it is there's the most familiar

37
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:39,459
face ever

38
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:41,840
you can't hear me come on I can hear you

39
00:01:39,459 --> 00:01:44,899
let's see a team's gonna figure it out

40
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,430
hopefully you guys can hear me I think

41
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,960
you can hear me otherwise I'd be hearing

42
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:49,610
people say we can't hear you bubble man

43
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:52,819
but there's a TA

44
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:54,439

brother that I haven't seen in forever

51

55
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,620
I'm sure you've got all sorts of

56
00:02:14,908 --> 00:02:18,060
wonderful things to share with us this

57
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:21,090
morning but I hope you've been well

58
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:22,829
above all else I have been well and I

59
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:24,509
hope the same to you I see you've been

60
00:02:22,829 --> 00:02:28,379
traveling around the world and

61
00:02:24,509 --> 00:02:30,389
definitely miss the opportunity to hang

62
00:02:28,378 --> 00:02:32,128
and to see what's going on because it's

63
00:02:30,389 --> 00:02:34,289
also been my connection as well because

64
00:02:32,128 --> 00:02:36,479
I've been underwater I mean it's it's

65
00:02:34,289 --> 00:02:40,709
been crazy it's been legal here in

66
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:42,358
California and it's been insanity

67
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:44,479
Pepper's to say the least

68
00:02:42,359 --> 00:02:46,709
you know we've got a whole new set of

69
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:48,840
clientele and people who are coming

70
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:50,908
through the door so it's been you know

71
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,979
all kinds of craziness but it's been a

72
00:02:50,908 --> 00:02:56,370
wonderful challenge and one that we've

73
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:59,098
been able to live up to and yeah it's

74
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:00,810
just yeah just trying to keep up with

75
00:02:59,098 --> 00:03:02,638
all the craziness we still don't have

76
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:04,019
permanent regulations here in California

77
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:06,689
we're still dealing in the temporary

78
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:08,188
world but of course I see there's a lot

79
00:03:06,688 --> 00:03:10,828
of changes happening up there in Canada

80
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:12,568
as well you know you've got a lot of

81
00:03:10,829 --> 00:03:14,790
changes happening to your system you've

82
00:03:12,568 --> 00:03:17,429
got a lot of consolidation happening

83
00:03:14,789 --> 00:03:20,818
right now people buying each other up so

84
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:22,620
it's been an interesting 140 plus days

85
00:03:20,818 --> 00:03:25,768
to say the least what do you have - oh

86
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:27,239
my gosh I've been I've been keeping busy

87
00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:29,609
for sure you know we went and enjoyed

88
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:31,169
spannabis there for a little bit and

89
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:32,939
that was a wonderful event and I ended

90
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:36,419
up in my York after that with these

91
00:03:32,939 --> 00:03:39,628
wonderful people Danny and grace who

92
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:42,209
were just gracious hosts that spent some

93
00:03:39,628 --> 00:03:44,698
we spent four days there with my friend

94
00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:46,079
Sean lost gardens on Instagram as well

95
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:49,590
as the maple butter boys

96
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:52,290
and then came home and have just been

97
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:54,209
one opportunity after the after another

98
00:03:52,289 --> 00:03:56,280
I'm actually in Toronto right now for

99
00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:58,590
the lift conference which has been going

100
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,030
really well it's a huge monstrous

101
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:03,509
conference there's all sorts of people

102
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:06,419
on both sides of the sort of invisible

103
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:08,039
fence that invisibly divides us I mean

104
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:10,199
for me we're all in this cannabis

105
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:12,030
industry together but there's a lot of

106
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:13,949
division you hear of course the people

107
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:15,389
who have licensed production facilities

108
00:04:13,949 --> 00:04:18,720
not all of them but some of them are

109
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:20,129
feeling a little short-handed by the

110
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,840
investments they've had to make the

111
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:23,579
hoops they've had to draw jump through

112
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,869
and how of course dispensaries don't

113
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:26,159
have to jump through those hoops so

114
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:29,009
they're actually pretty

115
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,990
profits and selling products while you

116
00:04:29,009 --> 00:04:32,759
know the other ones are not but in the

117
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:36,389
long run there's good people on both

118
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:38,430
sides and I'm pretty excited too to just

119
00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:40,229
see the industry growing every day

120
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:43,199

00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:25,560
last we saw you yeah

138
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:29,780
Wow chol address network I have I have a

139
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:33,740
new empathy for people who are in pain I

140
00:05:29,779 --> 00:05:37,099
destroyed my back this spring and had

141
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:42,389
emergency surgery seven weeks ago today

142
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:46,050
which I thought I would never do but the

143
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:48,810
pain stopped immediately the surgeon

144
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:50,970
took bone off of three vertebrae and

145
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:54,449
took material from two different disks

146
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:56,430
in my back and I have severe

147
00:05:54,449 --> 00:05:59,849
restrictions on activity for the next

148
00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:03,620
six months so I'm not a farmer this year

149
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:06,390
I'm a person who's going to be making

150
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:10,079
helping people understand how to use

151
00:06:06,389 --> 00:06:14,159
cannabis as medicine and all the

152
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:17,279
different ways that can happen and

153
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,800
meantime in our area I'm gonna be

154
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:23,129
helping the farmers who are providing

155
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,840
for collateral network or trying to get

156
00:06:23,129 --> 00:06:28,290
into the regulated marketplace here in

157
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:31,649
California any kind of help that I can

158
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:34,069
offer them about how to fit into the

159
00:06:31,649 --> 00:06:37,649
regulated marketplace and succeed in it

160
00:06:34,069 --> 00:06:39,870
well so many barriers have been put up

161
00:06:37,649 --> 00:06:42,929
to especially small farm

162
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:44,819
having any chance at all in this new

163
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:48,449
marketplace in California it's really

164
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:51,709
crazy well you know what as crazy as it

165
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:55,139
is first go ahead that's yeah yes

166
00:06:51,709 --> 00:06:56,669
frustration you know if we we embrace 64

167
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:59,009
in the change that happened and then the

168
00:06:56,670 --> 00:07:02,850
state of course created a lot of rules

169
00:06:59,009 --> 00:07:04,439
and one of the main reality is is they

170
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:07,470
allowed four counties and municipalities

171
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:11,040
to vote out cannabis altogether and that

172
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:13,470
has been extremely limiting across the

173
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:15,240
board so there's bills there's a bill

174
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:17,880
currently in the state trying to allow

175
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:20,189
for deliveries in areas where they're

176
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:22,409
barred from having any type of

177
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:25,649
distribution points in the sense of

178
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:27,780
retail outlets so it's been frustrating

179
00:07:25,649 --> 00:07:29,310
to watch many a farmer have to go back

180
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:32,219
into the underground because of the

181
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:35,550
inability to afford to come into this

182
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:37,500
real world you know we had to bootstrap

183
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:39,000
it ourselves and we're one of the more

184
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:42,360
successful ones and it was still very

185
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,209
challenging so you know it's it's still

186
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:47,340
frustrating for us that are able to you

187
00:07:45,209 --> 00:07:49,649
know move forward in this situation but

188
00:07:47,339 --> 00:07:51,599
it's it's even more frustrating to see

189
00:07:49,649 --> 00:07:54,239
all those that were in the system and

190
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:57,270
the were being successful now left on

191
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,769
the outside and we have to we have to

192
00:07:57,269 --> 00:08:01,139
show the stuff and we have to fix this

193
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:02,969
well I have faith in you guys as being

194
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:04,769
the right people to do it I want to say

195
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:08,100
I'm very sorry to hear about your back

196
00:08:04,769 --> 00:08:09,569
and your surgery Wade but I'm glad that

197
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,800
it worked out for you and that you're

198
00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:13,199
pain-free and of course you're still

199
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,790
doing the good work of Ja I want to

200
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,529
welcome forest from the khalad rias

201
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:19,140
Network and I want to welcome Erik from

202
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:21,029
forever flowering greenhouses I don't

203
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:22,889
want to say I want to say guys you know

204
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:25,079
it wasn't too long ago that our lives

205
00:08:22,889 --> 00:08:26,969
were being destroyed in a very different

206
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:29,279
way we were being jailed we were having

207
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:30,690
our dogs shot we were having our kids

208
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:32,129
taken away we were having all these

209
00:08:30,689 --> 00:08:35,100
things that was at such a different

210
00:08:32,129 --> 00:08:36,899
level that the obstacles we have now as

211
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:38,279
horrible as they are they are nothing

212
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:41,129
compared to what we've been dealing with

213
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:42,569
for the last 40-plus years and that I

214
00:08:41,129 --> 00:08:45,450
know that we're strong enough to get

215
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:48,600
through it so you may hear us bitching a

216
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:50,940
little bit about these difficult

217
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,250
regulations and the way good people are

218
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,640
being sort of forced out but we're gonna

219
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,289
fight

220
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:58,078
for those people we're gonna continue

221
00:08:55,289 --> 00:09:01,139
the fight and at least at least at least

222
00:08:58,078 --> 00:09:02,969
were not being imprisoned for 10 and 20

223
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:04,139
years at a time so let's not forget it

224
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:10,850
wasn't that long ago that they were

225
00:09:04,139 --> 00:09:13,588
doing that to us yes yes hey well most

226
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:17,339
good morning everybody boy it's good to

227
00:09:13,589 --> 00:09:20,660
see everyone again yeah that's what I

228
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:23,279
said too for us that's what I said too

229
00:09:20,659 --> 00:09:26,759
yeah just been that it's been a hole for

230
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:29,549
sure it's been a hole in the in the in

231
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:32,759
my world not having the church happened

232
00:09:29,549 --> 00:09:36,838
what's it been 100 and 160 days or so

233
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:39,059
one forty days now almost yeah yeah no

234
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:42,810
for real it's been about that long it's

235
00:09:39,059 --> 00:09:45,750
you know I was I was in YouTube prison I

236
00:09:42,809 --> 00:09:47,909
had one of my videos struck down I guess

237
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:49,708
someone flagged my video of me smoking a

238
00:09:47,909 --> 00:09:52,019
pure hash joint they struck the video

239
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:54,179
and when they struck the video they

240
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:56,549
simultaneously took away my ability to

241
00:09:54,179 --> 00:09:58,919
stream I didn't want to complain I

242
00:09:56,549 --> 00:10:00,689
didn't want to rock the boat I have a

243
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:03,599
huge appreciation for the YouTube

244
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:04,680
platform and for what they offer us and

245
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,060
I know there's all sorts of difficulties

246
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:08,189
with all sorts of different channels

247
00:10:06,059 --> 00:10:09,689
right now and I'm personally not going

248
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:12,720
to get into that discussion today too

249
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:15,060
much but I definitely was very very very

250
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,220
happy when I and I was searching I was

251
00:10:15,059 --> 00:10:21,088
checking every single day for the last

252
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:23,579
40 days 50 days if I could stream and

253
00:10:21,089 --> 00:10:25,019
one day I just went on and I went to

254
00:10:23,578 --> 00:10:27,448
stream and instead of saying no

255
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:29,578
streaming allowed on this channel it

256
00:10:27,448 --> 00:10:31,259
opened up the page and it showed me that

257
00:10:29,578 --> 00:10:33,929
I could write a title and start

258
00:10:31,259 --> 00:10:37,230
streaming and I was so giddy and so

259
00:10:33,929 --> 00:10:39,239
excited it was like oh my god oh my God

260
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:40,769
we're back like it's really it's really

261
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,680
quite frightening when you have a

262
00:10:40,769 --> 00:10:46,169
platform like this you know suddenly not

263
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:47,849
allow you to do something that you you

264
00:10:46,169 --> 00:10:49,649
know I don't want to say I took it for

265
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:51,659
granted because I absolutely don't first

266
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:53,669
of all take for granted all of you

267

268

never tell anyone particularly someone

292
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:54,490

00:12:21,009 --> 00:12:26,580
hear me or not how's it going we can

303
00:12:22,779 --> 00:12:26,579
hear you which what's your question wait

304
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:33,009
no question actually it was an excellent

305
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:36,129
observation he'd shared at the beginning

306
00:12:33,009 --> 00:12:38,259
of our meeting that he was taken down

307
00:12:36,129 --> 00:12:41,439
because we were smart he was smoking and

308
00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:44,470
here we are smoking again but I just

309
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:47,860
made an assumption we should be able to

310
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:49,540
smoke absolutely you know what I'm not

311
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:50,889
sure exactly why I have all sorts of

312
00:12:49,539 --> 00:12:52,689
YouTube videos there's all been all

313
00:12:50,889 --> 00:12:54,970
sorts of drama if you google it you can

314
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:56,980
you can look into it but I definitely am

315
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:59,740
NOT trying to rock the YouTube boat in

316
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:01,330
the sense that I'm very very happy with

317
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:03,490
them giving us permission to do this

318
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:05,020
chat again I don't take hash Church for

319
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:07,269
granted this is a very important

320
00:13:05,019 --> 00:13:10,299
platform and I really realized how

321
00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:12,220
important it is when I was not able to

322
00:13:10,299 --> 00:13:13,419
do it for a hundred and forty days and

323
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:15,370
towards the end of that hundred and

324
00:13:13,419 --> 00:13:17,019
forty days I thought I was never going

325
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:19,990
to be able to do it again and

326
00:13:17,019 --> 00:13:22,240

JD ji dam who has tears in their eyes

352
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:34,570
I'm telling you this is an emotional I

353
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:35,230
have goosebumps no joke I have

354
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:38,020
goosebumps

355
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:39,789
this is importance yeah the work that

356
00:14:38,019 --> 00:14:41,710
we've been doing on here is important go

357
00:14:39,789 --> 00:14:43,929
ahead Forrest as I say it's really

358
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:45,370
important you know I think that one of

359
00:14:43,929 --> 00:14:47,259
your points as far as how important this

360
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:49,810
platform is this is really critical and

361
00:14:47,259 --> 00:14:51,610
it ties in to why it was sitting down to

362
00:14:49,809 --> 00:14:55,029
begin with and one of the main things I

363
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:57,730
think programs like this do the work

364
00:14:55,029 --> 00:15:01,629
that we do at local and federal and our

365
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:04,870
national levels is help to break down

366
00:15:01,629 --> 00:15:07,090
that stigma that is tied with cannabis

367
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:08,500
is inherently wrong that there's

368
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:10,840
something just if you're involved with

369
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:14,889
it or something apparently bad or

370
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:18,070
dangerous with it and that is dissolving

371
00:15:14,889 --> 00:15:19,779
a little more slowly than I would like

372
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:21,970
but it's still there

373
00:15:19,779 --> 00:15:25,139
and it causes people to make decisions

374
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:27,670
that are bad and against their best

375
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:30,399
options for quality of life it causes

376
00:15:27,669 --> 00:15:31,929
people to to ban and counties like

377
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,639
talked about here in California

378
00:15:31,929 --> 00:15:36,129
everyone's like it's legal in California

379
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:40,629
but we have 85% of the counties still in

380
00:15:36,129 --> 00:15:42,460
a ban and how do we change the community

381
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:44,500
perception how do we get to hearts and

382
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:46,540
minds right we were able to share the

383
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:49,539
work we're doing we're able to put that

384
00:15:46,539 --> 00:15:51,879
into the communities we're able to

385
00:15:49,539 --> 00:15:54,129
change the context of the conversation

386
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:56,740
and it's really that's what's where

387
00:15:54,129 --> 00:15:58,419
we're at with cannabis is still we need

388
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:00,879
to put the work into the cultural shift

389
00:15:58,419 --> 00:16:02,049
of understanding instead of holding on

390
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:04,480
to this false

391
00:16:02,049 --> 00:16:06,729
you know dichotomy of sin that is

392
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:09,430
somehow attached to cannabis and really

393
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:12,159
anything that changes your mindset we

394
00:16:09,429 --> 00:16:15,419
have this old dogmatic idea that that

395
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:18,339
equals sin and you know or something bad

396
00:16:15,419 --> 00:16:20,129
in platforms like this and some of the

397
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:22,899
conversations I'm sure we'll get into

398
00:16:20,129 --> 00:16:27,250
are critical I think the impact really

399
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:30,189
can't be understated or overstated that

400
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:32,409
you know it's by having these ability to

401
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:33,850
get to so many different people share

402
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:35,829
what we're working with have them

403
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:38,590
working and sharing and speaking in

404
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:40,930
their communities that we really see the

405
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:42,700
biggest chance for impact on that

406
00:16:40,929 --> 00:16:44,889
cultural shift and it's that cultural

407
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:47,230
shift that is holding us back in the

408
00:16:44,889 --> 00:16:50,139
places that were we're so struggling for

409
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:52,210
rights no yeah but it's people like you

410
00:16:50,139 --> 00:16:53,740
that have been you know very much

411
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:56,530
congratulations to what you have been

412
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:59,620
doing in Sacramento to pass legislation

413
00:16:56,529 --> 00:17:01,539
to actually help others I've been

414
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:04,838
working behind the scenes with the

415
00:17:01,539 --> 00:17:08,639
veterans cannabis council and we've been

416
00:17:04,838 --> 00:17:11,619
actually we've got the first bill out of

417
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:14,080
out of out of Congress there we got the

418
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:16,059
first bill actually voted out to allow

419
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:18,099
for research regarding veterans so

420
00:17:16,059 --> 00:17:20,289
there's a lot of things that a lot of us

421
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:22,329
have been doing in the absence of being

422
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:24,609
here that are pushing forward for

423
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:26,049
positive change for all because you know

424
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:28,299
we can't just sit back and rest on our

425
00:17:26,049 --> 00:17:30,309
laurels but it also it reminds us that

426
00:17:28,299 --> 00:17:32,500
you know and seeing all these and

427
00:17:30,309 --> 00:17:34,629
justices of how much work we still have

428
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:36,880
to continue to do even with your

429
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:38,880
successes there in Sacramento it's just

430
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:42,100
a drop in the water compared to the

431
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,760
watershed moments we need to have so the

432
00:17:42,099 --> 00:17:45,469
ability for everybody who's

433
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:48,440
watching to still get active and get

434
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:52,880
involved is still in parallel and it's

435
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:56,330
so important it's so it to continue to

436
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:59,750
to make this momentum stronger and

437
00:17:56,329 --> 00:18:01,849
stronger that we've been able to show at

438
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:04,789
least on the state national and federal

439
00:18:01,849 --> 00:18:08,000
front but we still got you know 41 other

440
00:18:04,789 --> 00:18:09,859
states as well as those with legal still

441
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,470
have things we all have to work out and

442
00:18:09,859 --> 00:18:14,889
hopefully with this legislation coming

443
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:18,529
up federally which will supersede the

444
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:20,509
you know the veterans bill that we had

445
00:18:18,529 --> 00:18:21,829
going through will hopefully I don't

446
00:18:20,509 --> 00:18:23,690
take it out of scheduled one all

447
00:18:21,829 --> 00:18:26,539
together in the United States and allow

448
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:28,460
for it to proliferate through all 50

449
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:30,409
states so that maybe we can catch up to

450
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:34,819
you wonderful people in Canada since

451
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:37,490
we're still so lagging behind yeah you

452
00:18:34,819 --> 00:18:39,619
know I'm sure we'll get into that but

453
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:41,509
you know that's something that having a

454
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:43,149
platform offers is it's the ability to

455
00:18:41,509 --> 00:18:45,950
share with people what's going on

456
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:48,200
nationally at the state level and here

457
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:50,840
in the States and in Canada as well

458
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,799
what's going on there so that we can

459
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:53,269
steer people in the right direction

460
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:55,129
because I know with stuff that we're

461
00:18:53,269 --> 00:18:56,839
working on I meet people all the time it

462
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:59,420
man if I had a note about that I would

463
00:18:56,839 --> 00:19:01,609
love to participate or get groups

464
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:03,850
together and you know well how do we do

465
00:19:01,609 --> 00:19:06,979
that in social media the internet

466
00:19:03,849 --> 00:19:09,379
connecting with with folks is the most

467
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:10,910
efficient and best way to do it so I'm

468
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:12,920
really happy to be here Marcus I

469
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:14,210
appreciate the invite and I'm excited

470
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:16,279
it's what we're gonna get into here

471
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:18,289
today well I just want to add that

472
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:20,210
although maybe in the government and in

473
00:19:18,289 --> 00:19:22,220
the federal situation you guys are

474
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:24,829
behind in Canada's a little bit of ahead

475
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:27,710
but I've always looked to the American

476
00:19:24,829 --> 00:19:28,970
activists as my point of inspiration and

477
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:30,740
the work that you guys have done I

478
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:32,720
certainly don't feel that you guys are

479
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:35,319
behind us and your activism in any way

480
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:38,779
shape or form you guys are the leading

481
00:19:35,319 --> 00:19:42,230
world activists in my opinion and we've

482
00:19:38,779 --> 00:19:49,879
always looked to you to for for guidance

483
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:51,829
and for direction so bless up and that's

484
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,870
true and then there's the the few

485
00:19:51,829 --> 00:19:56,569
Americans that made it up to Canada that

486
00:19:53,869 --> 00:19:57,349
are even like more wild because they're

487
00:19:56,569 --> 00:19:59,599
just like

488
00:19:57,349 --> 00:20:02,058
just want the best of everything but you

489
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:03,500
know it is kind of crazy with the way

490
00:20:02,058 --> 00:20:06,168
that everything is right now because

491
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:08,269
we're all like the originators of

492
00:20:06,169 --> 00:20:10,190
cannabis and and other people that are

493
00:20:08,269 --> 00:20:12,859
out there to like the the as far as

494
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:15,200
cultivation goes in the culture and many

495
00:20:12,859 --> 00:20:17,149
of us farmers are just kind of

496
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,090
struggling to find our place meanwhile

497
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:22,788
there's 2.5 billion dollar deals being

498
00:20:20,089 --> 00:20:25,459
signed all over the place and 59

499
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:28,069
publicly traded companies here in Canada

500
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:30,350
and everywhere else you go in the world

501
00:20:28,069 --> 00:20:33,220
you would just think it was totally

502
00:20:30,349 --> 00:20:35,928
legal because the government and the

503
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:39,288
large-scale corporations are a hundred

504
00:20:35,929 --> 00:20:41,090
percent you know acting as if you know

505
00:20:39,288 --> 00:20:42,589
that they're publicly trading and making

506
00:20:41,089 --> 00:20:45,168
deals without even barely having any

507
00:20:42,589 --> 00:20:47,298
lead growing so I think that we've

508
00:20:45,169 --> 00:20:50,450
always said this at recently I'd say in

509
00:20:47,298 --> 00:20:53,990
the last year we really really need to

510
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:55,970
just stay in business whatever that

511
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:57,288
means to each individual because each

512
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:59,179
individual that means something

513
00:20:57,288 --> 00:21:01,009
different and staying in business with

514
00:20:59,179 --> 00:21:03,500
integrity you know all of these really

515
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:05,900
large it may seem like cannabis ahead

516
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:07,730
but what kind of ahead are we it's a

517
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:10,610
really interesting conversation because

518
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:13,400
all of these really large multinational

519
00:21:10,609 --> 00:21:14,839
multi international businesses now are

520
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,759
totally joining forces with

521
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:18,288
pharmaceutical companies and they're

522
00:21:16,759 --> 00:21:19,490
going all over the world and they're

523
00:21:18,288 --> 00:21:21,950
making deals and they're going to be

524
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:24,470
getting cheaper flowers from Colombia

525
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:25,788
from Jamaica from other places all over

526
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:28,069
the world they're not even going to be

527
00:21:25,788 --> 00:21:30,650
looking to Canadian growers for their

528
00:21:28,069 --> 00:21:32,389
flowers or because maybe this isn't such

529
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:34,490
a great place to be able to grow the

530
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:36,740
flowers cheaply they want to go to areas

531
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:39,409
that they can grow it cheaply sun-grown

532
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:41,690
and it really is going to be cutting out

533
00:21:39,409 --> 00:21:43,820
you know the small farmers they've been

534
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:45,470
having legislation and they've been able

535
00:21:43,819 --> 00:21:48,439
to set up business but they haven't even

536
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:51,079
given us our our licenses and we don't

537
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:52,940
even know what's happening yet well the

538
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:55,788
beautiful the beautiful thing is is that

539
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:57,320
although it may cut out a lot of people

540
00:21:55,788 --> 00:21:58,970
in the sense that now this is going to

541
00:21:57,319 --> 00:22:00,889
be a legal business that the whole world

542
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:02,329
is and one thing I can say from being at

543
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:04,370
the lift conference there's all sorts of

544
00:22:02,329 --> 00:22:06,408
different people from different walks of

545
00:22:04,369 --> 00:22:08,629
life that I've been speaking to you know

546
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:11,149
people that I may have almost harshly

547
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:13,460
judged years ago through my own

548
00:22:11,148 --> 00:22:16,008
potentiation of my own stereotype as a

549
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:18,019
as a as a whatever you want to call me I

550
00:22:16,009 --> 00:22:19,759
was more of a hippie mentality and I

551
00:22:18,019 --> 00:22:21,798
would call it kind of call them the Jo

552
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:23,479
stray tease you know as I'm sitting on

553
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:25,999
hash Turks looking like a Jo straight II

554
00:22:23,479 --> 00:22:27,409
but I had some incredible conversations

555
00:22:25,999 --> 00:22:29,569
over the last few days and one of the

556
00:22:27,409 --> 00:22:31,789
things that really struck me whether or

557
00:22:29,569 --> 00:22:33,618
not it was about money that was getting

558
00:22:31,788 --> 00:22:35,298
people excited or not it really felt

559
00:22:33,618 --> 00:22:37,878
like these people all of these people

560
00:22:35,298 --> 00:22:39,888
that I met had had a passion for

561
00:22:37,878 --> 00:22:41,148
cannabis had an excitement like they

562
00:22:39,888 --> 00:22:43,248
were walking through their lives as

563
00:22:41,148 --> 00:22:44,898
zombies before and now they were getting

564
00:22:43,249 --> 00:22:46,909
into this cannabis and I just felt like

565
00:22:44,898 --> 00:22:49,459
you know what this is just gonna be a

566
00:22:46,909 --> 00:22:51,019
good thing like people are excited you

567
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:53,479
know they were working in construction

568
00:22:51,019 --> 00:22:54,679
or they were doing you know mining or

569
00:22:53,479 --> 00:22:56,330
they were doing like they were working

570
00:22:54,679 --> 00:22:58,009
in agriculture but with cows and

571
00:22:56,329 --> 00:22:59,628
chickens and they were doing all these

572
00:22:58,009 --> 00:23:01,399
different things and from all these

573
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:02,959
different walks of life and as I speak

574
00:23:01,398 --> 00:23:05,268
to each one of them individually and

575
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,619
spend time with them I realized that

576
00:23:05,269 --> 00:23:07,969
they're just people that are just trying

577
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:09,228
to live their lives they're just trying

578
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:11,359
to do good and now they have this

579
00:23:09,229 --> 00:23:13,308
cannabis plant and I feel like if you're

580
00:23:11,358 --> 00:23:15,408
gonna have cannabis in your life you're

581
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:18,048
gonna be hard set not to have it in it

582
00:23:15,409 --> 00:23:19,729
put in a positive influence into your

583
00:23:18,048 --> 00:23:21,918
life you know I've used it personally as

584
00:23:19,729 --> 00:23:23,989
a guiding light for for a couple of

585
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:25,489
decades now almost three decades and it

586
00:23:23,989 --> 00:23:27,409
was neat to see people for the first

587
00:23:25,489 --> 00:23:29,450
time turning on their cannabis

588
00:23:27,409 --> 00:23:31,669
flashlights getting the batteries on and

589
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:33,048
flicking that switch because you can see

590
00:23:31,669 --> 00:23:36,288
it in their eyes there's a real

591
00:23:33,048 --> 00:23:38,118
excitement and I obviously hope that

592
00:23:36,288 --> 00:23:40,700
everyone that wants to be involved gets

593
00:23:38,118 --> 00:23:42,168
to be involved and at the same time no

594
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:43,969
one's ever going to be able to stop you

595
00:23:42,169 --> 00:23:45,739
from growing your own cannabis the same

596
00:23:43,969 --> 00:23:47,179
way you growing your own flowers you're

597
00:23:45,739 --> 00:23:49,038
gonna be able to do it here in the very

598
00:23:47,179 --> 00:23:50,749
near future for sure in Canada with

599
00:23:49,038 --> 00:23:53,088
recreational right around the corner and

600
00:23:50,749 --> 00:23:55,278
over 50 to 60,000 people already

601
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:58,729
federally exempt through the medical

602
00:23:55,278 --> 00:24:00,528
programs I think America is really gonna

603
00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:01,548
get on board in the next five years I

604
00:24:00,528 --> 00:24:03,499
think we're gonna see federal

605
00:24:01,548 --> 00:24:05,749
legalization down there the work that

606
00:24:03,499 --> 00:24:07,669
people like at Terre and forest and all

607
00:24:05,749 --> 00:24:10,489
of these different incredible activists

608
00:24:07,669 --> 00:24:15,710
are doing it can't be ignored anymore it

609
00:24:10,489 --> 00:24:17,389
just can't be well we were also forced

610
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:19,819
them that they can't ignore us that's

611
00:24:17,388 --> 00:24:21,858
the other thing you know now we just

612
00:24:19,819 --> 00:24:25,039
that rider I mean the bill that we had

613
00:24:21,858 --> 00:24:27,789
we had 52 co-sponsors that's been

614
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:30,859
Cades worth of work to get those 52

615
00:24:27,789 --> 00:24:32,930
co-sponsors to put that on so all this

616
00:24:30,859 --> 00:24:34,669
time while people sit around bitching

617
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:36,380
and complaining we've been putting in

618
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:38,870
the work by going down there and

619
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:41,390
lobbying year in and year out and

620
00:24:38,869 --> 00:24:45,139
putting in that time so that we not only

621
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:48,710
had one we had 52 and so now we have a

622
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:51,710
constituency so strong that if they go

623
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:53,720
against us we can now shame them okay

624
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:56,090
this is a total shift in dynamics that

625
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:58,400
we as veterans can shame them and it's

626
00:24:56,089 --> 00:25:02,119
better it's Memorial Day this weekend so

627
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:03,950
shout out to all veterans including the

628
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:05,299
drug war veterans but especially those

629
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:07,130
that have lost their lives because

630
00:25:05,299 --> 00:25:09,169
that's what Memorial Day is to remember

631
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:11,060
those who have lost their lives so don't

632
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:12,830
forget those you know my cousin was

633
00:25:11,059 --> 00:25:14,839
killed in war but I've lost countless

634
00:25:12,829 --> 00:25:16,730
other friends in this drug war and I

635
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:18,439
view them all equally because it's all

636
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:21,160
shameful what's actually happened to all

637
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:24,170
of us but it shows that and you know

638
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:26,840
gossiped reminders that we have more and

639
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:28,400
more work to do and if you don't do it

640
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:33,769
ourselves you know

641
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:36,980
no one else is gonna do it so why that

642
00:25:33,769 --> 00:25:39,829
would look to be the one and only with

643
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:46,130
that neither the man himself most year

644
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:48,559
most years skunk how many people just

645
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:56,090

to the you know 22 vets a day kill

653
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:14,960
themselves so you got to remember that

654
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:17,000
people you know the lot of stresses that

655
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:19,430
we go through and this is a very healing

656
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,220
herb for all including our soldiers yeah

657
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:25,250
you know so never forget and especially

658
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:27,319
the 22 because it's more than 22 that

659
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:30,230
will die today because of that you know

660
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:32,450
so that's why that's why things are

661
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:35,029
changing is that we I mean the reality

662
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:38,779
is is that we have the moral and ethical

663
00:26:35,029 --> 00:26:41,869
high ground we have the science

664
00:26:38,779 --> 00:26:44,240
back it up at this point saying we can

665
00:26:41,869 --> 00:26:47,419
do more science is really just saying I

666
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:49,819
haven't read or looked at it at all

667
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:51,860
you know there's absolutely the science

668
00:26:49,819 --> 00:26:54,950
there to back it up and what we have now

669
00:26:51,859 --> 00:26:58,609
is the group of activists all over the

670
00:26:54,950 --> 00:27:00,559
world that can articulate it in a

671
00:26:58,609 --> 00:27:02,689
different way that kind of breaks down

672
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:05,750
again what we were talking about about

673
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:08,269
some of the social that ideological and

674
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:10,359
dogmatic arguments of cannabis being bad

675
00:27:08,269 --> 00:27:14,900
because it makes you feel funny you know

676
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:19,069
so it's happening the the fight and in

677
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:21,170
18 hip is perfectly is where the urgency

678
00:27:19,069 --> 00:27:22,700
comes from with with our group and with

679
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:25,519
the veterans groups we work with and I

680
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:27,590
really see those two some of those two

681
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:31,819
categories to some of the the most risk

682
00:27:27,589 --> 00:27:33,919
is that we want the people to still be

683
00:27:31,819 --> 00:27:36,200
around when that day comes we know it's

684
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:39,650
coming but we want as many people to

685
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:40,970
survive to see that day as possible and

686
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:47,150
I don't think that it is really

687
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:51,289
understood how the slow reactions how

688
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:54,769
the passivity of lawmakers really

689
00:27:51,289 --> 00:27:57,859
equates death and lives and cost people

690
00:27:54,769 --> 00:28:00,680
their lives so I want us hear from Sam -

691
00:27:57,859 --> 00:28:03,109
is he gone is he still here but I want

692
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:04,670
to also get into ETS bill I want to hear

693
00:28:03,109 --> 00:28:10,159
more about it before we go today for

694
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:12,890
sure and share the work I am here and I

695
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:17,980
want to pipe up about one subject which

696
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:20,870
was will the future of cannabis be

697
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:23,569
produced in places like Columbia and

698
00:28:20,869 --> 00:28:27,079
other places well if you look at the cut

699
00:28:23,569 --> 00:28:30,369
flower industry all of the flowers are

700
00:28:27,079 --> 00:28:34,189
produced in Malaysia Kenya Colombia

701
00:28:30,369 --> 00:28:37,219
places like this I mean they they sell

702
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:40,340
90% of the flowers produced in the

703
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:44,000
industry and there's a reason why it's

704
00:28:40,339 --> 00:28:47,329
it's labor costs and nobody can compete

705
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,099
with that to be honest but have any of

706
00:28:47,329 --> 00:28:51,710
you ever worried about where you cut

707
00:28:49,099 --> 00:28:52,279
flowers come from I mean nobody cared

708
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:55,370
they

709
00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:57,019
- cheap price I mean I see where they

710
00:28:55,369 --> 00:29:00,609
come from because all the green houses

711
00:28:57,019 --> 00:29:02,869
in California are all old cut flower

712
00:29:00,609 --> 00:29:04,849
greenhouses that are now converted to

713
00:29:02,869 --> 00:29:07,119
cannabis or converting to cannabis I

714
00:29:04,849 --> 00:29:09,709
mean probably more cut flower

715
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:12,649
greenhouses in the last year than I ever

716
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:14,829
thought I would imagine and Santa

717
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:20,660
Barbara County has the most mixed light

718
00:29:14,829 --> 00:29:23,899
licenses in California right now I don't

719
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:25,790
rind up my cut flower extract it and

720
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:29,840
feed it to my nine year old kid so

721
00:29:25,789 --> 00:29:32,500
that's true - there's a different level

722
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:35,720
of expectation there's different ways

723
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:37,250
the cut flower industry also has a lot

724
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:39,950
of organic growers

725
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:42,500
you know so the stuff is totally clean

726
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:44,269
it's safe I think that we're gonna be in

727
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:46,400
a unique position kind of like in the

728
00:29:44,269 --> 00:29:48,710
aromatherapy and essential oil world

729
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:50,780
where specific essential oils express

730
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:52,579
themselves uniquely depending on the

731
00:29:50,779 --> 00:29:54,619
different regions that they're grown and

732
00:29:52,579 --> 00:29:56,240
although it might not be the majority of

733
00:29:54,619 --> 00:29:58,659
the marketplace I think there's always

734
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:01,579
going to be a place in the market for

735
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:05,170
cannabis grown in specific regions and

736
00:30:01,579 --> 00:30:09,109
specific soils with specific Sun cycles

737
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:11,060
to express I agree Marcus and if you

738
00:30:09,109 --> 00:30:13,519
think about it right now with beer

739
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:17,269
whiskey and wine none of which I take

740
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:19,069
but it is a big business and it's much

741
00:30:17,269 --> 00:30:22,160
better to be a legal business and any

742
00:30:19,069 --> 00:30:23,750
illegal business but you can buy it from

743
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:25,580
any country in the world

744
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:27,950
you can buy beer from any country you

745
00:30:25,579 --> 00:30:30,349
can buy wine from any country you could

746
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:32,210
buy whiskey from any country and I look

747
00:30:30,349 --> 00:30:35,209
forward to in the future of cannabis is

748
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:38,539
that way that you can buy cannabis

749
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:40,430
products from any country in any country

750
00:30:38,539 --> 00:30:43,490
oh I would love to have the opportunity

751
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:45,080
to buy your gland cannabis or some of

752
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:47,120
the other countries that are now

753
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:48,500
starting to produce cannabis well I know

754
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:50,449
a lot of those countries would love to

755
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:52,579
have some of our California cannabis but

756
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:54,380
the reality is is those other countries

757
00:30:52,579 --> 00:30:56,569
will be able to produce it for much

758
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:57,950
cheaper and a better quality than what

759
00:30:56,569 --> 00:30:59,750
we'll be able to produce here in the

760
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:01,610
United States so imports will be

761
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:03,589
something that will be considered just

762
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:06,178
like anything else you know regionally

763
00:31:03,589 --> 00:31:07,829
you know in in the winter we get our

764
00:31:06,179 --> 00:31:09,869
our vegetables from you know South

765
00:31:07,829 --> 00:31:12,749
America you know and all these types of

766
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:15,628
regionalism that has you know built

767
00:31:12,749 --> 00:31:18,749
their industries to accommodate the type

768
00:31:15,628 --> 00:31:21,109
of international food commerce and trade

769
00:31:18,749 --> 00:31:23,249
that is there so eventually will be

770
00:31:21,109 --> 00:31:25,258
available I mean here in the United

771
00:31:23,249 --> 00:31:27,690
States you've got you know people like

772
00:31:25,259 --> 00:31:30,419
Humboldt Mendocino that are trying to

773
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:32,610
you know start to label or constitute

774
00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:35,240
their label to protect themselves like

775
00:31:32,609 --> 00:31:37,829
champagne did for the Champagne region

776
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:39,480
you know that anything that comes that

777
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:40,829
has the name champagne has to be grown

778
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,360
in the Champagne region

779
00:31:40,829 --> 00:31:44,579
you know same thing that's marked

780
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:46,949
Humboldt has to be marked humble and you

781
00:31:44,579 --> 00:31:49,949
can't be outside of Humboldt and market

782
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:52,590
that so these are new challenges too you

783
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:55,200
know just small-time regional realities

784
00:31:52,589 --> 00:31:57,269
that Sam come on we barely here much

785
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:00,509
less at that international level where

786
00:31:57,269 --> 00:32:01,859
we could import export we can even get

787
00:32:00,509 --> 00:32:04,230
it to where we can't even get it over

788
00:32:01,859 --> 00:32:06,118
state lines I mean even County to County

789
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:08,339
it's challenging here in California were

790
00:32:06,118 --> 00:32:10,288
considered this liberal Bastion when

791
00:32:08,339 --> 00:32:12,628
we're still just in the muck right now

792
00:32:10,288 --> 00:32:14,548
so I look forward to those days to Sam

793
00:32:12,628 --> 00:32:17,668
because I would love to be able to you

794
00:32:14,548 --> 00:32:19,528
know import Moroccan or Lebanese or you

795
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:21,419
know some of the other you know exotic

796
00:32:19,528 --> 00:32:23,638
cannabis that you know especially those

797
00:32:21,419 --> 00:32:25,559
genetics that are being found in Africa

798
00:32:23,638 --> 00:32:28,048
currently you know there's a lot of

799
00:32:25,558 --> 00:32:30,269
stuff that has a lot to do with our pure

800
00:32:28,048 --> 00:32:32,220
certification that we started I mean if

801
00:32:30,269 --> 00:32:34,048
you look at those industries like the

802
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:36,360
beer industry I mean Oregon was one of

803
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:38,398
the first like big microbrews States to

804
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:41,069
really promote microbrewing and have

805
00:32:38,398 --> 00:32:42,778
micro brews as a thing and if you go

806
00:32:41,069 --> 00:32:44,939
into the stores in Oregon I mean it's an

807
00:32:42,778 --> 00:32:46,558
explosion of micro brews and some of

808
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:49,409
them are really really successful and

809
00:32:46,558 --> 00:32:51,089
really amazing so pure farmers and pure

810
00:32:49,409 --> 00:32:52,409
certified farmers are making a

811
00:32:51,089 --> 00:32:55,470
difference they have their own unique

812
00:32:52,409 --> 00:32:57,210
you know soils and brands their own you

813
00:32:55,470 --> 00:33:00,419
they tell their story and it's more of

814
00:32:57,210 --> 00:33:02,759
like a farm-to-table farm to seed soil

815
00:33:00,419 --> 00:33:05,009
to table soil to Bowl whatever you want

816
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:07,470
to call it you know it's it's people

817
00:33:05,009 --> 00:33:09,118
showing why they're not different and

818
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:10,950
when you go to those other countries it

819
00:33:09,118 --> 00:33:12,898
sounds really exotic when you're here

820
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:14,850
with the minute you show up there you

821
00:33:12,898 --> 00:33:17,158
find out that all the banned pesticides

822
00:33:14,849 --> 00:33:18,719
from the US are there and who the hell

823
00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:19,920
knows what they put in their soil so

824
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,450
honestly I

825
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:23,340
don't want to smoke that stuff from that

826
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:25,289
country because I know about paraquat

827
00:33:23,339 --> 00:33:28,230
and [ __ ] that's been sprayed all over

828
00:33:25,289 --> 00:33:31,109
Mexico and until we go there or someone

829
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:33,569
else goes there with some some like some

830
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:35,759
values and morals and and says oh or

831
00:33:33,569 --> 00:33:37,589
yeah no these people are totally growing

832
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:39,690
of nature then now I can take that

833
00:33:37,589 --> 00:33:41,699
medicine and put it into my body for my

834
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:43,289
nine year old is the reason why we you

835
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:45,390
know as you all are saying we need to

836
00:33:43,289 --> 00:33:47,339
join together more on an international

837
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:49,020
level you know we've been in the in the

838
00:33:47,339 --> 00:33:50,939
black market and all of these really

839
00:33:49,019 --> 00:33:53,670
large corporations are joining together

840
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:57,330
they are talking to major companies they

841
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:59,100
are buying huge land shares of these you

842
00:33:57,329 --> 00:34:00,720
know greenhouses of cut flowers they've

843
00:33:59,099 --> 00:34:03,059
already been doing this for years and

844
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:05,339
set up for it and I believe that it is

845
00:34:03,059 --> 00:34:06,929
imperative that we all join together and

846
00:34:05,339 --> 00:34:08,880
that we do have a louder voice because

847
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:10,559
our voice is the culture of cannabis and

848
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:13,369
we have to stay unique because that's

849
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:16,079
what they don't have is something unique

850
00:34:13,369 --> 00:34:18,150
well you got a hope that people from all

851
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:20,099
different countries are being inspired

852
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:21,929
by conversations like the ones that

853
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:23,880
we're having and that there's going to

854
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:26,789
be people who do things on the highest

855
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:27,990
level possible in all of these different

856
00:34:26,789 --> 00:34:29,909
countries and of course just like

857
00:34:27,989 --> 00:34:31,709
everything there will be you know many

858
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:33,418
people who don't do it with the highest

859
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:35,730
of integrity that's just the way the

860
00:34:33,418 --> 00:34:37,918
world works I compare it to you know

861
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:40,800
look at how many people wear non organic

862
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:42,929
cotton and eat non-organic food and buy

863
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,550
the cheapest beers and wine and the

864
00:34:42,929 --> 00:34:47,639
cheapest cigarettes and the cheapest

865
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:49,560
everything so it's money is a big sort

866
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:51,299
of controlling factor in the world and

867
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:53,519
we're kind of in a first world where we

868
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:55,169
get to sort of be self righteous but

869
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:57,630
when people are working their fingers to

870
00:34:55,168 --> 00:34:59,819
the bones for pennies it's a really big

871
00:34:57,630 --> 00:35:02,099
deal to you know be able to save money

872
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:04,380
where they can and buy things that are

873
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:05,940
as inexpensive as possible of course

874
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:08,130
they want the highest caliber I'm

875
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:11,730
certain but some people is just not an

876
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:17,400
economic reality for them also to the

877
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:19,440
honest truth is that I mean products are

878
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:21,920
not grown organically in California when

879
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:24,570
they tested it 60% of it had

880
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:27,680
contamination from pesticides and

881
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:31,070
fungicides I mean Jesus

882
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:33,649
pointing at the foreign companies who

883
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:35,920
may or may not be more guilty

884
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:39,320
why don't we clean up our own act first

885
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:42,740
that's been a challenge I agree and one

886
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:44,059
that has been you know that's why we

887
00:35:42,739 --> 00:35:46,250
started testing in the first place

888
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:47,989
that's why we we you know we had to

889
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:49,489
reinvent the wheel so that we could know

890
00:35:47,989 --> 00:35:51,409
what's in there but yes it is still

891
00:35:49,489 --> 00:35:52,939
frustrating when you know we test

892
00:35:51,409 --> 00:35:55,429
everything and everything when I was on

893
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:57,349
my floor we hope to set those types of

894
00:35:55,429 --> 00:35:59,480
examples to do things right but it has

895
00:35:57,349 --> 00:36:02,029
also shown us over the last 19 years now

896
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:04,340
how many people won't do it right so

897
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:06,560
that also shows that we have to be the

898
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:09,140
stewards we have to foster the

899
00:36:06,559 --> 00:36:11,329
environment we have to be the integrity

900
00:36:09,139 --> 00:36:13,519
leaders that show people otherwise

901
00:36:11,329 --> 00:36:14,869
you're just tossed in with the mess of

902
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:17,150
it we're not setting the example that

903
00:36:14,869 --> 00:36:19,579
needs to be set and it's hard it's

904
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:21,289
expensive it's not [ __ ] easy but if

905
00:36:19,579 --> 00:36:23,329
you want to do it right you have to do

906
00:36:21,289 --> 00:36:25,369
it right and it's well worth doing it

907
00:36:23,329 --> 00:36:27,259
right you know I don't want somebody

908
00:36:25,369 --> 00:36:29,779
something to affect somebody to kill

909
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:31,850
somebody you know somebody's son or

910
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:33,740
daughter because of you know a pesticide

911
00:36:31,849 --> 00:36:35,750
that wasn't screened for it gets through

912
00:36:33,739 --> 00:36:37,549
and becomes a toxic shock to their body

913
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:39,469
and next thing you know I've got another

914
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:40,910
death on my hands I got enough of that

915
00:36:39,469 --> 00:36:43,129
from war I don't need any of that

916
00:36:40,909 --> 00:36:45,199
further but how many people have our

917
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:47,900
type of integrity how many people like

918
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:49,429
you Sam went out there when you realize

919
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:51,200
that cannabis wasn't there that you

920
00:36:49,429 --> 00:36:52,849
actually went out there and hunted down

921
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:54,919
those genetics and then created the

922
00:36:52,849 --> 00:36:57,980
genetics that we all share and enjoy

923
00:36:54,920 --> 00:37:00,380
today you know we need more people I

924
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:02,990
also try to help people have an

925
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:05,360
alternative with my pest and disease

926
00:37:02,989 --> 00:37:07,909
book to try to show people you don't

927
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:11,420
have to use poisons there is a higher

928
00:37:07,909 --> 00:37:13,129
road that's an amazing book by the way

929
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:16,340
for anyone that hasn't checked it out

930
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:19,990
that is definitely some you want to take

931
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:25,039
a course in cannabis pests and diseases

932
00:37:19,989 --> 00:37:27,049
that book is the one some of its

933
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:29,239
education as well because you know we

934
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:30,980
had a problem it's a cloud-based network

935
00:37:29,239 --> 00:37:34,789
with people who were trying to grow

936
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:36,800
clean but when we started making the

937
00:37:34,789 --> 00:37:38,659
extracts we were seeing micro butanol

938
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,789
pop up and other things that was finally

939
00:37:38,659 --> 00:37:41,420
tracked down the systemic pesticide

940
00:37:40,789 --> 00:37:44,539
issues for

941
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:47,088
nurseries that they assumed were okay

942
00:37:44,539 --> 00:37:49,039
you know so I think still I think we're

943
00:37:47,088 --> 00:37:52,068
seeing a higher failure rate we had the

944
00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:53,900
destroy 40% of what was donated to us

945
00:37:52,068 --> 00:37:55,789
because of pesticide poisoning or

946
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:58,430
pesticide you know showing up in

947
00:37:55,789 --> 00:38:01,460
contaminants but some of the people who

948
00:37:58,429 --> 00:38:03,019
did that or donated those things so

949
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:05,298
there were people who were great in

950
00:38:03,019 --> 00:38:06,920
spirit and doing everything clean and so

951
00:38:05,298 --> 00:38:09,108
we had the trapper back to where it was

952
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:10,700
coming from and so it's the general

953
00:38:09,108 --> 00:38:13,308
industry as a whole I think is their

954
00:38:10,699 --> 00:38:15,649
understanding better how some of these

955
00:38:13,309 --> 00:38:17,420
work I think we're gonna see really a

956
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:19,608
more separation from people with good

957
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:22,818
intentions but are still just have this

958
00:38:19,608 --> 00:38:24,348
systemic problem and the people who just

959
00:38:22,818 --> 00:38:27,108
don't care and they're still praying

960
00:38:24,349 --> 00:38:28,970
it's raining and this is exactly what

961
00:38:27,108 --> 00:38:32,328
we're talking about I mean you can't

962
00:38:28,969 --> 00:38:34,189
trust the USDA or the federal government

963
00:38:32,329 --> 00:38:35,930
of any countries to tell you that what

964
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:37,880
you're using is safe you have to go

965
00:38:35,929 --> 00:38:40,608
beyond that and trust your gut and know

966
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:43,068
what's happening in nature so everything

967
00:38:40,608 --> 00:38:44,960
that's happening on on farms that we

968
00:38:43,068 --> 00:38:47,480
work with and pee and other people they

969
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,798
have to test every single thing that

970
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:51,139
comes on their property because the

971
00:38:48,798 --> 00:38:53,900
whole point of cannabis is that it pulls

972
00:38:51,139 --> 00:38:56,868
what's in the soil up into the plant and

973
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:59,660
also and also with rooms with with

974
00:38:56,869 --> 00:39:02,358
clones and stuff michael--ah butanol is

975
00:38:59,659 --> 00:39:05,659
almost like a radiating element you can

976
00:39:02,358 --> 00:39:07,219
have a room not even used and then have

977
00:39:05,659 --> 00:39:09,048
and then have people come back in and

978
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:11,598
use it again and there's still problems

979
00:39:09,048 --> 00:39:13,818
with it you you have to be smarter than

980
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:16,309
the system you have to be able to to go

981
00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:18,318
beyond and it's really really important

982
00:39:16,309 --> 00:39:20,690
and and Eric's talking about the cut

983
00:39:18,318 --> 00:39:23,029
flower things that in Santa Barbara and

984
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:25,338
Central California I think it would be

985
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:27,260
really really really difficult to grow a

986
00:39:25,338 --> 00:39:29,119
really clean product no matter who you

987
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:34,640
are the whole environment is really

988
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:36,289
really taxed we're gonna be taking over

989
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:38,960
large land shares you know in other

990
00:39:36,289 --> 00:39:41,750
countries or in California got those

991
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:44,240
land shares and and that soil is TOC

992
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:46,010
stout and remediation has to take you

993
00:39:44,239 --> 00:39:47,750
know immediate precedents before

994
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:49,790
anything else you know when you go and

995
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:51,079
you buy a piece of land in order to be

996
00:39:49,789 --> 00:39:52,460
integral the first thing that you're

997
00:39:51,079 --> 00:39:54,140
thinking is how am I going to remediate

998
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:55,340
this yeah and the soils that don't just

999
00:39:54,139 --> 00:39:57,469
remediate or

1000
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:59,539
one cycle of composting or what it takes

1001
00:39:57,469 --> 00:40:02,269
like a year two years you know three

1002
00:39:59,539 --> 00:40:04,789
years a big work and that's why Humboldt

1003
00:40:02,269 --> 00:40:06,829
Mendocino in California or around Chico

1004
00:40:04,789 --> 00:40:09,679
or even Grass Valley are really

1005
00:40:06,829 --> 00:40:10,519
important for cannabis growing so what

1006
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:12,409
do you think Eric

1007
00:40:10,519 --> 00:40:15,139
they've been dumped on though - I mean

1008
00:40:12,409 --> 00:40:17,089
surprisingly enough all my travels I'm

1009
00:40:15,139 --> 00:40:19,460
starting to meet a lot of old breeders

1010
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:20,840
or people not old breeders but people

1011
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:22,280
that have been around a long time we

1012
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:24,829
would consider the pioneers in the

1013
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:27,410
industry and unfortunately a good

1014
00:40:24,829 --> 00:40:29,630
portion of everybody I've met didn't

1015
00:40:27,409 --> 00:40:31,969
know Eagle 20 was bad back in the day

1016
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:34,640
and so it's been used and it's in there

1017
00:40:31,969 --> 00:40:36,409
it's you know roundup when they when

1018
00:40:34,639 --> 00:40:38,210
they talk about the percentages of kids

1019
00:40:36,409 --> 00:40:41,059
that when they take a pee and they test

1020
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:42,889
their pee for roundup it's it's in

1021
00:40:41,059 --> 00:40:45,710
everything basically they're saying and

1022
00:40:42,889 --> 00:40:47,239
so when I did the moderating at the

1023
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:49,670
emerald-cut for the panel on the

1024
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:51,109
pesticides you know one of the things

1025
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:53,930
the labs and the Department of pesticide

1026
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:56,420
regulation said is what is the metric

1027
00:40:53,929 --> 00:40:59,329
for clean because really everything is

1028
00:40:56,420 --> 00:41:01,220
contaminated so how do we find zero for

1029
00:40:59,329 --> 00:41:04,789
cleanliness and go from there because

1030
00:41:01,219 --> 00:41:06,679
everything ultimately is contaminated to

1031
00:41:04,789 --> 00:41:09,170
a certain level so I mean it might seems

1032
00:41:06,679 --> 00:41:11,599
kind of scary and saying that what you

1033
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:12,860
can't you know in reality it is but at

1034
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:14,150
the end of the day what's happening

1035
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:17,059
right now is the cannabis industry

1036
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:19,250
forced its own people out and so now we

1037
00:41:17,059 --> 00:41:21,469
have a whole new generation of people

1038
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:23,329
and don't get me wrong there's a lot of

1039
00:41:21,469 --> 00:41:25,339
pioneers involved but a lot of those

1040
00:41:23,329 --> 00:41:27,469
pioneers are big names for other reasons

1041
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:30,289
they weren't necessarily big growers

1042
00:41:27,469 --> 00:41:32,929
they were big companies for one week

1043
00:41:30,289 --> 00:41:37,219
maybe it was a type of genetic it was a

1044
00:41:32,929 --> 00:41:39,710
type of an extract or whatever and so

1045
00:41:37,219 --> 00:41:41,419
they weren't technically big large but

1046
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:43,970
they get investors to throw this big

1047
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:45,470
lump of money find a place in Salinas of

1048
00:41:43,969 --> 00:41:47,149
Santa Barbara and they want to set up

1049
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:49,909
shop and then everybody grabs their

1050
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:51,680
darts and starts throwing the darts at

1051
00:41:49,909 --> 00:41:53,539
the dartboard basically and they try to

1052
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:55,669
figure it out and what I saw in Santa

1053
00:41:53,539 --> 00:41:57,199
Barbara in some of these places is you

1054
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:59,710
know we're gonna move into some of those

1055
00:41:57,199 --> 00:42:02,059
old wooden greenhouses the greenhouse

1056
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:04,340
megastructures are these big cut flower

1057
00:42:02,059 --> 00:42:06,799
farms are still operating their farms

1058
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:08,630
but they've scaled down to barely one

1059
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:11,360
greenhouse let's say on their meg

1060
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:13,309
megha farm and so what they do is they

1061
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:16,550
lease out the biggest pieces of [ __ ]

1062
00:42:13,309 --> 00:42:18,289
left on the farm to the cannabis growers

1063
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:21,350
and so the cannabis growers go to these

1064
00:42:18,289 --> 00:42:23,059
old wooden [ __ ] basically and have

1065
00:42:21,349 --> 00:42:24,319
to fix them up because Santa Barbara

1066
00:42:23,059 --> 00:42:26,059
County won't let you build a new

1067
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:28,580
greenhouse you have to fix up what's

1068
00:42:26,059 --> 00:42:30,230
already there and so then people go in

1069
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:32,210
and spend a ton of money trying to fix

1070
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:33,889
up a greenhouse and they go broke before

1071
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:36,079
they even get a plant in the ground and

1072
00:42:33,889 --> 00:42:37,670
then the second person comes along and

1073
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:39,590
leases that greenhouse and then they

1074
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:42,079
continue working on it and put a ton of

1075
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:44,000
money into it they go under and then the

1076
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:45,889
third person gets to move in and the

1077
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,230
third person's actually stoked because

1078
00:42:45,889 --> 00:42:50,809
the third person you know has all this

1079
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:52,760
[ __ ] done that the first two people ran

1080
00:42:50,809 --> 00:42:56,059
out of money trying to accomplish so I

1081
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:58,550
mean it's really funny to see how much

1082
00:42:56,059 --> 00:43:00,380
money is going into everything to the

1083
00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:02,750
people throwing darts and the big names

1084
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:04,730
that really might not be the people to

1085
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:06,230
scale up but the investors want to run

1086
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:09,500
on the big name they don't necessarily

1087
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:12,650
know that the clean beautiful flower is

1088
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:14,630
what's gonna make the make the win but

1089
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:16,309
you know rather cling to the big names

1090
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:18,050
and then all the other people that

1091
00:43:16,309 --> 00:43:19,250
couldn't get permits all the people that

1092
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:22,280
know what they're doing that's been

1093
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:24,349
educated are pioneering you know family

1094
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:26,360
members so to speak or left without

1095
00:43:24,349 --> 00:43:29,239
permits and kind of in the dust and now

1096
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:30,860
who are they well I think the soil is a

1097
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:32,779
big part of it like dragonfly Earth

1098
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:34,579
medicine crew was mentioning there and I

1099
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:37,390
think on the other side if you look at

1100
00:43:34,579 --> 00:43:39,949
the majority of plants produced clonally

1101
00:43:37,389 --> 00:43:42,129
micropropagation and tissue culture is

1102
00:43:39,949 --> 00:43:44,960
an answer to being able to clean out

1103
00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:47,059
pathogens and fungi zand microbials from

1104
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:50,119
plants that have been impregnated over

1105
00:43:47,059 --> 00:43:53,299
generations with just incredible amounts

1106
00:43:50,119 --> 00:43:55,339
of systemic problems you know including

1107
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:58,360
things like micro butanol and and all

1108
00:43:55,340 --> 00:44:00,800
these horrible eagle 20s and and just

1109
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:03,380
ridiculous pesticides it's definitely a

1110
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:05,210
way you know if we start looking at that

1111
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:07,670
to start sort of cleaning up and

1112
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:09,710
renewing vigor on these plants and it

1113
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:11,570
seems to be working for many other

1114
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:13,849
different clonally produced plants

1115
00:44:11,570 --> 00:44:15,830
around the globe it's just gonna take

1116
00:44:13,849 --> 00:44:18,199
some time and our testing is levelling

1117
00:44:15,829 --> 00:44:20,029
up as we go with legalization so

1118
00:44:18,199 --> 00:44:22,098
technically right now there's medical

1119
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:23,778
mixed in with recreational

1120
00:44:22,099 --> 00:44:26,329
um you know a lot of the rollout

1121
00:44:23,778 --> 00:44:28,608
California had anyway isn't going as

1122
00:44:26,329 --> 00:44:30,470
expected as far as how to deal with the

1123
00:44:28,608 --> 00:44:32,659
medical and the recreational that's left

1124
00:44:30,469 --> 00:44:34,189
over from last year and so I think

1125
00:44:32,659 --> 00:44:36,018
there's just a lot of gray areas and

1126
00:44:34,190 --> 00:44:38,150
yeah there are solutions and I agree

1127
00:44:36,018 --> 00:44:40,058
with you there are answers and we can

1128
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:43,220
get to where we need to be but

1129
00:44:40,059 --> 00:44:45,109
unfortunately with this California the

1130
00:44:43,219 --> 00:44:46,728
way it is I guess you should say we're

1131
00:44:45,108 --> 00:44:48,739
gonna go through we're gonna be going

1132
00:44:46,728 --> 00:44:51,978
through some [ __ ] for a couple years I

1133
00:44:48,739 --> 00:44:53,900
think in order to get this organized and

1134
00:44:51,978 --> 00:44:55,728
it really makes no sense at all because

1135
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:58,420
my club butanol and small percentages

1136
00:44:55,728 --> 00:45:02,960
can be used on strawberries wellness

1137
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:05,568
everywhere like eating that berry

1138
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:07,278
growers so you know in Salinas area

1139
00:45:05,568 --> 00:45:10,009
their strawberries everywhere and

1140
00:45:07,278 --> 00:45:11,900
lettuce and you know in Mendocino and

1141
00:45:10,009 --> 00:45:14,630
other places there's tons of grapes and

1142
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:16,789
wine and then when you go to Santa

1143
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:18,700
Barbara there's tons of avocados so one

1144
00:45:16,789 --> 00:45:21,499
of the greenhouse facilities I was at

1145
00:45:18,699 --> 00:45:23,899
was you know a major greenhouse facility

1146
00:45:21,498 --> 00:45:26,088
with five different farms or four at

1147
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:27,858
least on the same property and the

1148
00:45:26,088 --> 00:45:30,858
neighbor next door was about to spray

1149
00:45:27,858 --> 00:45:32,239
with the helicopter avid on his avocados

1150
00:45:30,858 --> 00:45:34,608
because that's what they do once a year

1151
00:45:32,239 --> 00:45:36,710
so you know over here you got the orchid

1152
00:45:34,608 --> 00:45:38,659
grow with their exhaust fans blowing out

1153
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:40,849
this way towards the cannabis grower the

1154
00:45:38,659 --> 00:45:42,798
neighbor that literally has his branches

1155
00:45:40,849 --> 00:45:45,890
of trees hanging over the fence going

1156
00:45:42,798 --> 00:45:47,509
I'm about to spray avid on my avocados I

1157
00:45:45,889 --> 00:45:49,489
do it once a year and everybody's trying

1158
00:45:47,509 --> 00:45:51,318
to do these sealed greenhouses sucking

1159
00:45:49,489 --> 00:45:53,509
in all this air and blowing it all out

1160
00:45:51,318 --> 00:45:54,858
and I can't say that passive would solve

1161
00:45:53,509 --> 00:45:57,798
the problem either in some of those

1162
00:45:54,858 --> 00:45:59,538
situations but I mean everybody's kind

1163
00:45:57,798 --> 00:46:00,739
of in fear you know if you're not if you

1164
00:45:59,539 --> 00:46:02,420
don't have a permit and you're about to

1165
00:46:00,739 --> 00:46:04,099
jump off you know you got these people

1166
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:06,170
that are permitted and they don't you

1167
00:46:04,099 --> 00:46:08,359
know it's like it's just the whole

1168
00:46:06,170 --> 00:46:10,369
coming unglued situation right now on

1169
00:46:08,358 --> 00:46:12,588
how to sort it all out with the speed of

1170
00:46:10,369 --> 00:46:15,079
lightning that needs to get done because

1171
00:46:12,588 --> 00:46:16,489
investors want to see returns now and

1172
00:46:15,079 --> 00:46:18,079
they want to see the money coming back

1173
00:46:16,489 --> 00:46:20,568
and everybody like I said with their

1174
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:22,818
dart throwing capabilities of you know

1175
00:46:20,568 --> 00:46:25,278
resorted to two gallon pots or one

1176
00:46:22,818 --> 00:46:28,248
gallon pots you know kind of see a green

1177
00:46:25,278 --> 00:46:29,568
and maybe it's gonna be organic or not

1178
00:46:28,248 --> 00:46:32,868
but we all know that it's not gonna be

1179
00:46:29,568 --> 00:46:35,778
living soiler or you know no-till or

1180
00:46:32,869 --> 00:46:36,170
anything like that so I mean the organic

1181
00:46:35,778 --> 00:46:37,940
words

1182
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:40,490
definitely like you guys know Kelly and

1183
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:43,700
Josh the word organic is watered down

1184
00:46:40,489 --> 00:46:45,798
and you know organic produce from other

1185
00:46:43,699 --> 00:46:49,279
countries isn't organic even though it

1186
00:46:45,798 --> 00:46:50,869
says it is it's just not so I mean you

1187
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:52,790
know what's the level of cleanliness

1188
00:46:50,869 --> 00:46:54,440
that we can go by I guess you could say

1189
00:46:52,789 --> 00:46:57,318
and it might just have to go for where

1190
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:59,030
you are and your farm and your personal

1191
00:46:57,318 --> 00:47:00,858
situation in order to do that because

1192
00:46:59,030 --> 00:47:03,349
the conglomerates are gonna have a tough

1193
00:47:00,858 --> 00:47:07,159
time that's why it's all extracts anyway

1194
00:47:03,349 --> 00:47:08,750
but as Forrest was saying you know a lot

1195
00:47:07,159 --> 00:47:10,519
of the extracts get thrown out and I

1196
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:13,730
heard some people up north are taking

1197
00:47:10,519 --> 00:47:18,619
the approach like the chemical company

1198
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:21,500
dilution is the solution and you know

1199
00:47:18,619 --> 00:47:23,630
this isn't this is this is even it isn't

1200
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:25,068
even a conversation about glyphosate you

1201
00:47:23,630 --> 00:47:27,410
know that that's that's a conversation

1202
00:47:25,068 --> 00:47:30,349
that nobody is even having we have to

1203
00:47:27,409 --> 00:47:32,509
test you know um all of our all of our

1204
00:47:30,349 --> 00:47:34,400
inputs you know for our products and

1205
00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:37,430
that's like a really long list of herbs

1206
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:39,079
and we go to areas all over and try to

1207
00:47:37,429 --> 00:47:40,879
find small farmers and then we're

1208
00:47:39,079 --> 00:47:42,710
testing their glyphosate levels even

1209
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:44,869
though you know and that's outside of

1210
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:46,608
the realm because you know the USDA

1211
00:47:44,869 --> 00:47:48,410
feels like glyphosate can be put in a

1212
00:47:46,608 --> 00:47:50,568
baby bottle and babies can drink it they

1213
00:47:48,409 --> 00:47:53,539
don't see it as something that's totally

1214
00:47:50,568 --> 00:47:55,730
toxic yeah we know but we know over

1215
00:47:53,539 --> 00:47:57,980
prolonged use that it kills soil

1216
00:47:55,730 --> 00:47:59,869
microbiology and if we're killing soil

1217
00:47:57,980 --> 00:48:01,670
microbiology then we're killing all of

1218
00:47:59,869 --> 00:48:04,250
the microbes inside of our gut and then

1219
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:06,048
that just takes away our intelligence

1220
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:08,210
and I feel like you know the glyphosate

1221
00:48:06,048 --> 00:48:09,949
conversation is something that hasn't

1222
00:48:08,210 --> 00:48:12,650
even been talked about because it's not

1223
00:48:09,949 --> 00:48:16,399
something that they're testing for in

1224
00:48:12,650 --> 00:48:18,940
cannabis testing for in you know all of

1225
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:21,289
our organic fruits and vegetable I

1226
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:23,150
didn't really realize that they didn't

1227
00:48:21,289 --> 00:48:25,369
test for molds in Oregon or was it

1228
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:27,710
Washington or Oregon I didn't really I

1229
00:48:25,369 --> 00:48:29,720
saw I was reading some stuff and there

1230
00:48:27,710 --> 00:48:31,519
was somebody that opened up a bud out of

1231
00:48:29,719 --> 00:48:34,909
a dispensary and it was covered in mold

1232
00:48:31,519 --> 00:48:36,530
and I guess you know it's not it's not

1233
00:48:34,909 --> 00:48:40,190
something they test for up there is that

1234
00:48:36,530 --> 00:48:42,798
true yeah they're not testing for any

1235
00:48:40,190 --> 00:48:43,940
kind of molds or fungi at this point

1236
00:48:42,798 --> 00:48:46,759
right now because they can't

1237
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:49,039
differentiate the DNA between them so

1238
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:49,370
you know whatever counts like say lactic

1239
00:48:49,039 --> 00:48:52,070
ass

1240
00:48:49,369 --> 00:48:53,989
bacteria there's 36 or even more

1241
00:48:52,070 --> 00:48:55,910
different types of species of lactic

1242
00:48:53,989 --> 00:48:57,739
acid that floats around in the

1243
00:48:55,909 --> 00:49:00,349
environment if it lands on your flower

1244
00:48:57,739 --> 00:49:01,699
it's really only a beneficial to us but

1245
00:49:00,349 --> 00:49:03,710
it's still going to come up as a

1246
00:49:01,699 --> 00:49:06,379
negative on the test they can't

1247
00:49:03,710 --> 00:49:08,449
differentiate the DNA species so they've

1248
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:11,869
done away with it and actually that's

1249
00:49:08,449 --> 00:49:14,059
not true they can differentiate Kevin

1250
00:49:11,869 --> 00:49:18,829
McCarty can but they're not doing it is

1251
00:49:14,059 --> 00:49:20,840
what I'm saying it's a very yes they

1252
00:49:18,829 --> 00:49:22,579
definitely can and they aren't doing it

1253
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:23,900
I think because of the cost of that test

1254
00:49:22,579 --> 00:49:26,840
and maybe you have something to say

1255
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:30,650
about that Kevin curtains gonna come in

1256
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:33,680
later on today as well Sam okay let him

1257
00:49:30,650 --> 00:49:35,360
deal with it yeah he said he should be

1258
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:36,829
popping in in in a little bit here so

1259
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:38,630
hopefully he'll be it will be able to

1260
00:49:36,829 --> 00:49:40,549
pick that up when he comes in and ask

1261
00:49:38,630 --> 00:49:43,490
him about that because that's definitely

1262
00:49:40,550 --> 00:49:45,320
very very important that they're testing

1263
00:49:43,489 --> 00:49:47,659
for these things I mean it's just the

1264
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:49,910
level of cleanliness depends on you know

1265
00:49:47,659 --> 00:49:52,099
this farmers and the testing labs to

1266
00:49:49,909 --> 00:49:53,809
kind of do the due diligence and you

1267
00:49:52,099 --> 00:49:56,569
know from what you hear from a lot of

1268
00:49:53,809 --> 00:49:58,759
flower people or farmers that you know

1269
00:49:56,570 --> 00:50:00,650
testing labs aren't always the same from

1270
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:04,010
one to another and that can be kind of

1271
00:50:00,650 --> 00:50:06,170
confusing as well for people to you know

1272
00:50:04,010 --> 00:50:08,000
make their path forward if one lab

1273
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:09,800
saying one thing and another lab saying

1274
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,690
another whether it's passed or fail or

1275
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:13,490
percentages or these terpenes you know

1276
00:50:11,690 --> 00:50:16,039
people are trying to use the labs also

1277
00:50:13,489 --> 00:50:17,989
to brand their products with you know

1278
00:50:16,039 --> 00:50:20,059
what they do include in them you know

1279
00:50:17,989 --> 00:50:23,659
what's included is really important from

1280
00:50:20,059 --> 00:50:29,150
the lab but unfortunately we find out a

1281
00:50:23,659 --> 00:50:32,119
lot of things that you know there is an

1282
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:34,700
easy solution for that which is they all

1283
00:50:32,119 --> 00:50:36,650
have to use the same testing protocol

1284
00:50:34,699 --> 00:50:39,949
and it gets checked by an independent

1285
00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:43,369
agency it doesn't matter which state or

1286
00:50:39,949 --> 00:50:46,849
whatever there is a proper protocol and

1287
00:50:43,369 --> 00:50:48,739
that should be used really we need that

1288
00:50:46,849 --> 00:50:50,799
in California in the sense there needs

1289
00:50:48,739 --> 00:50:53,119
to be some sort of a laboratory

1290
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:56,390
regulation industry which is of course

1291
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:58,730
now the BCC is supposed but they're

1292
00:50:56,389 --> 00:51:01,159
they've dragged their feet just getting

1293
00:50:58,730 --> 00:51:03,050
us certified with just these emergency

1294
00:51:01,159 --> 00:51:04,849
regulations which we have to

1295
00:51:03,050 --> 00:51:07,370
and get recertified every three months

1296
00:51:04,849 --> 00:51:09,949
until the permanent regs so yeah we're

1297
00:51:07,369 --> 00:51:12,259
trying to get there Sam which is time

1298
00:51:09,949 --> 00:51:14,719
well that's the challenge is like we

1299
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:16,520
need regulation but we're being

1300
00:51:14,719 --> 00:51:18,889
regulated to death you know

1301
00:51:16,519 --> 00:51:20,780
and you know as cannabis and wait could

1302
00:51:18,889 --> 00:51:22,400
probably talk about maybe some of what

1303
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:24,710
he's doing but getting in with the AG

1304
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:26,750
commissions locally and some of the

1305
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:30,590
farmers you know when you speak with

1306
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:32,719
them they say you know one of the fears

1307
00:51:30,590 --> 00:51:34,430
they have is looking at cannabis is an

1308
00:51:32,719 --> 00:51:36,829
AG product they're already dying small

1309
00:51:34,429 --> 00:51:38,629
farmers are dying because they are over

1310
00:51:36,829 --> 00:51:41,000
regulated already and then cannabis adds

1311
00:51:38,630 --> 00:51:43,400
this whole other level to it that it's

1312
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,780
just kind of has other industries

1313
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:46,880
looking going oh if they can do it to

1314
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:49,040
them they can do it to us too you know

1315
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:51,490
which is why I think getting involved in

1316
00:51:49,039 --> 00:51:55,099
the in the AG committees and commissions

1317
00:51:51,489 --> 00:51:56,929
at the local level and beyond is really

1318
00:51:55,099 --> 00:51:59,869
important for cannabis work in the in

1319
00:51:56,929 --> 00:52:01,309
the future and the more people that test

1320
00:51:59,869 --> 00:52:02,779
the prices will come down because I'm

1321
00:52:01,309 --> 00:52:04,639
seeing people writing you know the

1322
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:06,440
testing prices are high you goddamn

1323
00:52:04,639 --> 00:52:08,210
right they're high you should have seen

1324
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:10,730
what it cost me when I was pioneering

1325
00:52:08,210 --> 00:52:12,500
this 11 years ago you wouldn't want to

1326
00:52:10,730 --> 00:52:14,750
see the expense but it is one of those

1327
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:16,849
necessary evils I had to swallow and

1328
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:18,440
deal with so that we could arrive at a

1329
00:52:16,849 --> 00:52:21,019
point where we actually have you know

1330
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:22,789
ring testing and satellite testing so

1331
00:52:21,019 --> 00:52:25,159
that we could verify that these

1332
00:52:22,789 --> 00:52:27,679
laboratories were actually doing what

1333
00:52:25,159 --> 00:52:30,559
you know Sam was saying actually showing

1334
00:52:27,679 --> 00:52:32,569
proper protocol or you know the big

1335
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:35,480
frustration I had was then people tried

1336
00:52:32,570 --> 00:52:37,309
to proprietor make their testing a

1337
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:38,599
proprietary situation so that we

1338
00:52:37,309 --> 00:52:40,969
couldn't even see what the [ __ ]

1339
00:52:38,599 --> 00:52:43,219
testing was you know so it's been a

1340
00:52:40,969 --> 00:52:45,739
fight all the way through in one that

1341
00:52:43,219 --> 00:52:47,750
has to be fought all the way to the end

1342
00:52:45,739 --> 00:52:48,789
well we don't want to see you know

1343
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:52,610
lesion

1344
00:52:48,789 --> 00:52:56,659
go ahead Sam attend at least you had a

1345
00:52:52,610 --> 00:52:58,309
choice of lab or labs when I started

1346
00:52:56,659 --> 00:53:00,769
there were no labs

1347
00:52:58,309 --> 00:53:03,769
Dero well that's the same thing I had I

1348
00:53:00,769 --> 00:53:05,239
had zero labs I had to bring people from

1349
00:53:03,769 --> 00:53:07,759
around the world and create that first

1350
00:53:05,239 --> 00:53:10,219
lab now if that lab is spread to others

1351
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:11,690
but yes I agree I was in the same boat

1352
00:53:10,219 --> 00:53:14,059
as you I had to reinvent the wheel

1353
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:16,760
because the Research Triangle wouldn't

1354
00:53:14,059 --> 00:53:22,299
give us anything I had to buy the GC

1355
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:25,430
by the HPLC and build a laboratory and

1356
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:30,260
hire a scientist just for in-house use

1357
00:53:25,429 --> 00:53:31,690
well that's Martin dude that's your like

1358
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:34,820
on the next level you're an inspiration

1359
00:53:31,690 --> 00:53:36,200
yeah you took the bullet so that all I

1360
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:38,120
had to do is deal with people already

1361
00:53:36,199 --> 00:53:40,519
had the machines you know what I'm

1362
00:53:38,119 --> 00:53:41,989
saying so I agree I respect that I

1363
00:53:40,519 --> 00:53:43,519
didn't have to spend the quarter million

1364
00:53:41,989 --> 00:53:45,589
dollars of three quarters of a million

1365
00:53:43,519 --> 00:53:47,509
dollars on the type of machinery that is

1366
00:53:45,590 --> 00:53:49,130
really required to actually do that and

1367
00:53:47,510 --> 00:53:51,170
that's for real folks that's what those

1368
00:53:49,130 --> 00:53:53,090
machines cost that was ten years ago

1369
00:53:51,170 --> 00:53:55,490
which means they cost even more today I

1370
00:53:53,090 --> 00:53:57,140
just want to add that the photo I was

1371
00:53:55,489 --> 00:54:00,619
holding up while we were talking this is

1372
00:53:57,139 --> 00:54:01,909
a macro photograph of powdery mildew so

1373
00:54:00,619 --> 00:54:04,279
for those of you that have never seen

1374
00:54:01,909 --> 00:54:08,299
powdery mildew up close it looks like

1375
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:10,220
little little little bug bodies they

1376
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:12,620
just stack on top of one another and

1377
00:54:10,219 --> 00:54:14,750
they create these long sort of strings

1378
00:54:12,619 --> 00:54:17,929
and you can see the size of them versus

1379
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:20,210
the size of the glandular trichomes

1380
00:54:17,929 --> 00:54:22,429
they're quite thin and quite small but

1381
00:54:20,210 --> 00:54:24,619
they get everywhere they wrap themselves

1382
00:54:22,429 --> 00:54:28,339
around the resin there's no escaping it

1383
00:54:24,619 --> 00:54:30,619
it's definitely a bad scene and in the

1384
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:33,200
photograph does it penetrate the resin

1385
00:54:30,619 --> 00:54:35,029
or can they be separated I haven't seen

1386
00:54:33,199 --> 00:54:37,159
it penetrate the resin Sam but how is

1387
00:54:35,030 --> 00:54:38,900
that for timing Kevin mckernon is in the

1388
00:54:37,159 --> 00:54:41,839
room and we're talking about microbials

1389
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:43,579
and being able to test to decipher the

1390
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:45,740
difference between and we're showing a

1391
00:54:43,579 --> 00:54:50,210
macro photograph of powdery mildew right

1392
00:54:45,739 --> 00:54:51,759
now for my Instagram account while it

1393
00:54:50,210 --> 00:54:56,900

00:55:15,769 --> 00:55:18,949
videos talking about it I've heard

1404
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:20,989
people making videos to talk about it

1405
00:55:18,949 --> 00:55:23,109
and getting their channels deleted so

1406
00:55:20,989 --> 00:55:25,639
I'm just praying that we make it through

heavy book and it's an expensive book it

1432
00:56:32,539 --> 00:56:38,720
ain't cheap no but it's not worth

1433
00:56:35,210 --> 00:56:41,358
supporting it's the real deal yes but

1434
00:56:38,719 --> 00:56:43,669
that product I mean if you look at the

1435
00:56:41,358 --> 00:56:46,429
cost of the knowledge and the knowledge

1436
00:56:43,670 --> 00:56:48,440
that's in it it is priceless it is well

1437
00:56:46,429 --> 00:56:50,449
worth any expense that's there if you

1439
00:56:50,449 --> 00:56:54,288
thank you Sam and thank you rob Clark

1440
00:56:52,639 --> 00:56:57,558
for showing us how to [ __ ] do it

1441
00:56:54,289 --> 00:56:59,059
right and bless you I guess like hey

1442
00:56:57,559 --> 00:57:01,999
what are you reading and what's the book

1443
00:56:59,059 --> 00:57:03,528
and I think well it's 260 dollars and it

1444
00:57:01,998 --> 00:57:05,179
comes out of this University

1445
00:57:03,528 --> 00:57:06,588
a lot of people don't want to spend it

1446
00:57:05,179 --> 00:57:08,838
but you know if you really want to learn

1447
00:57:06,588 --> 00:57:13,518
those are the books with the information

1448
00:57:08,838 --> 00:57:14,480
or they're not cheap also Johnny

1449
00:57:13,518 --> 00:57:17,379
McPartland

1450
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:20,809
John McPartlin contributed to that book

1451
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:23,778
probably as much or more than me and Rob

1452
00:57:20,809 --> 00:57:26,660
Rob took the pictures I had the hands-on

1453
00:57:23,778 --> 00:57:29,210
practical knowledge and John had his

1454
00:57:26,659 --> 00:57:32,179
nose buried in libraries and research

1455
00:57:29,210 --> 00:57:35,179
things to find all the information that

1456
00:57:32,179 --> 00:57:36,858
I didn't know and Rob didn't know but it

1457
00:57:35,179 --> 00:57:38,919
together the three of us were an

1458
00:57:36,858 --> 00:57:41,719
unbeatable team

1459
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:43,889
did any macro photos end up in that book

1460
00:57:41,719 --> 00:57:46,768
I don't

1461
00:57:43,889 --> 00:57:49,139
I don't remember to be honest I don't

1462
00:57:46,768 --> 00:57:51,118
have a copy with me yeah no I can't

1463
00:57:49,139 --> 00:57:52,710
remember either I think I sent some for

1464
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:54,990
some reason but I can't keep up with

1465
00:57:52,710 --> 00:57:57,119
which ones get in and which ones don't

1466
00:57:54,989 --> 00:57:58,979
so it is a great book regardless of any

1467
00:57:57,119 --> 00:58:01,440
macro photographs the information that

1468
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:03,420
it is I mean it's a resource that you

1469
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:05,010
just if you're growing cannabis and

1470
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:06,960
you're dealing with pests and diseases

1471
00:58:05,010 --> 00:58:08,430
which you are if you're growing cannabis

1472
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:11,789
you're gonna want to have this

1473
00:58:08,429 --> 00:58:13,889
information in your library and it's

1474
00:58:11,789 --> 00:58:17,119
only in hardback as far as I know right

1475
00:58:13,889 --> 00:58:21,929
Sam I've never seen it soft back no

1476
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:24,028
paper man you almost need to come out

1477
00:58:21,929 --> 00:58:26,068
with a ringed copy so that you could

1478
00:58:24,028 --> 00:58:27,420
easily turn the pages if it's just in

1479
00:58:26,068 --> 00:58:29,909
case you come up with another one there

1480
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:34,829
is Sam in the future reference book then

1481
00:58:29,909 --> 00:58:38,009
a growers hands on manual in the

1482
00:58:34,829 --> 00:58:44,369
greenhouse but yeah we thought about it

1483
00:58:38,010 --> 00:58:46,650
but we just didn't do it I want to speak

1484
00:58:44,369 --> 00:58:50,460
about the testing thing again that was a

1485
00:58:46,650 --> 00:58:53,639
knee up I had to step out for a minute

1486
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:56,250
but the other night I heard I was in a

1487
00:58:53,639 --> 00:58:58,018
conversation with a fellow who was one

1488
00:58:56,250 --> 00:59:01,679
of the pioneers in the organic food

1489
00:58:58,018 --> 00:59:04,199
movement who lives here in our area and

1490
00:59:01,679 --> 00:59:05,969
he had many things to say but one of the

1491
00:59:04,199 --> 00:59:09,929
things he pointed out is that there are

1492
00:59:05,969 --> 00:59:12,568
more than a thousand chemical compounds

1493
00:59:09,929 --> 00:59:16,828
that are certified for use on food

1494
00:59:12,568 --> 00:59:18,750
products in California and all of them

1495
00:59:16,829 --> 00:59:21,119
have to do with controlling pests or

1496
00:59:18,750 --> 00:59:25,079
diseases and meantime how will we ever

1497
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:28,740
ask our labs to be able to test for that

1498
00:59:25,079 --> 00:59:31,380
many compounds in cannabis I really want

1499
00:59:28,739 --> 00:59:34,348
to suggest that dragonfly Earth you you

1500
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:36,769
guys have nailed down to me the real

1501
00:59:34,349 --> 00:59:40,528
concept about how to do this which is to

1502
00:59:36,768 --> 00:59:43,379
know your sources know all the inputs to

1503
00:59:40,528 --> 00:59:45,329
your garden over time you can remediate

1504
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:48,690
your soil and the environment you're in

1505
00:59:45,329 --> 00:59:52,200
and by making your own inputs you have a

1506
00:59:48,690 --> 00:59:54,119
fair sense of knowing that your product

1507
00:59:52,199 --> 00:59:56,149
the material you're producing will in

1508
00:59:54,119 --> 00:59:58,338
fact be free of contaminants

1509
00:59:56,150 --> 01:00:01,309
and then it's a matter of building a

1510
00:59:58,338 --> 01:00:03,980
back story behind you and your work and

1511
01:00:01,309 --> 01:00:06,048
what you're producing that makes it

1512
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:08,900
worth it in the agricultural market

1513
01:00:06,048 --> 01:00:10,579
because if Tomatoes is a good example in

1514
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:13,849
California there are people who grow

1515
01:00:10,579 --> 01:00:16,400
tomatoes they get paid 14 cents a pound

1516
01:00:13,849 --> 01:00:19,180
for their tomatoes of course they're

1517
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:22,010
selling it in 40,000 pound trucks

1518
01:00:19,179 --> 01:00:24,318
there's other people who get paid $4 a

1519
01:00:22,010 --> 01:00:25,990
pound for their tomatoes and I suggest

1520
01:00:24,318 --> 01:00:29,210
that cannabis has a much wider

1521
01:00:25,989 --> 01:00:32,509
discretionary marketplace if you will

1522
01:00:29,210 --> 01:00:35,119
for what we call top shelf but when you

1523
01:00:32,510 --> 01:00:39,890
start talking about medical need for me

1524
01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:41,750
it's really about the producers have to

1525
01:00:39,889 --> 01:00:44,949
know what they're doing that's why that

1526
01:00:41,750 --> 01:00:48,440
book is so important to me Sam thank you

1527
01:00:44,949 --> 01:00:50,598
so that you know when you offer some oil

1528
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:52,190
to one of these families you know that

1529
01:00:50,599 --> 01:00:54,440
it's going to be free of contaminants

1530
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:56,838
even if it's been to the lab and it's

1531
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:59,298
tested for what's there they're only

1532
01:00:56,838 --> 01:01:02,449
testing for 20-some different pesticides

1533
01:00:59,298 --> 01:01:05,000
I don't remember we can test for 39

1534
01:01:02,449 --> 01:01:07,519
currently but out of the thousand and

1535
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:10,608
subject certified in California for you

1536
01:01:07,519 --> 01:01:13,880
direct but you know ten years ago we had

1537
01:01:10,608 --> 01:01:16,098
zero okay so this shows you the length

1538
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:18,740
and time that science takes it's not

1539
01:01:16,099 --> 01:01:21,528
fast you know Kevin can speak to it very

1540
01:01:18,739 --> 01:01:23,538
very precisely you know science can't be

1541
01:01:21,528 --> 01:01:25,369
rushed you know it has to be done it has

1542
01:01:23,539 --> 01:01:27,859
to be replicated it has to be done

1543
01:01:25,369 --> 01:01:30,920
properly and so each year we're able to

1544
01:01:27,858 --> 01:01:32,989
add and add other pesticides as we get

1545
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:34,760
them and then the laboratories can

1546
01:01:32,989 --> 01:01:36,949
quantify or they can get the actual

1547
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:38,720
standards to actually quantify and then

1548
01:01:36,949 --> 01:01:41,179
it's then added to the list so then we

1549
01:01:38,719 --> 01:01:43,308
have 40 that we can test for but it

1550
01:01:41,179 --> 01:01:45,469
shows you and that should give you an

1551
01:01:43,309 --> 01:01:47,510
everybody an idea of the drop in the

1552
01:01:45,469 --> 01:01:52,250
water we're still dealing with and we're

1553
01:01:47,510 --> 01:01:53,778
supposedly doing it right I'd be

1554
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:56,659
interested in an explorer in the world

1555
01:01:53,778 --> 01:01:58,969
of microbials too as far as testing and

1556
01:01:56,659 --> 01:02:02,149
you know you you you want to have the

1557
01:01:58,969 --> 01:02:03,558
alternative to the pesticides you know

1558
01:02:02,150 --> 01:02:06,650
you may be talking about you know

1559
01:02:03,559 --> 01:02:09,140
microbial growth and biological growth

1560
01:02:06,650 --> 01:02:10,010
from soils and also potentially your

1561
01:02:09,139 --> 01:02:13,460
foliar spray

1562
01:02:10,010 --> 01:02:17,660
if maybe Kevin you can you can went way

1563
01:02:13,460 --> 01:02:19,369
in on this you know is it hard to tell

1564
01:02:17,659 --> 01:02:22,969
the difference between probiotic

1565
01:02:19,369 --> 01:02:26,630
microbials and pathogenic microbes or or

1566
01:02:22,969 --> 01:02:28,489
trichoderma and botrytis yeah so that's

1567
01:02:26,630 --> 01:02:31,099
a good point in Kyle Boyer just did a

1568
01:02:28,489 --> 01:02:32,869
great webinar on this with the can group

1569
01:02:31,099 --> 01:02:35,509
last week I'll try and for that link

1570
01:02:32,869 --> 01:02:37,279
around on this but the attractive derma

1571
01:02:35,510 --> 01:02:39,740
is key for getting rid of Aspergillus I

1572
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:41,180
mean the the the problem we have is the

1573
01:02:39,739 --> 01:02:43,009
well the probably not in California

1574
01:02:41,179 --> 01:02:44,659
where Calum or California put writes

1575
01:02:43,010 --> 01:02:45,980
down they're a very species specific so

1576
01:02:44,659 --> 01:02:48,379
that you're not getting penalized for

1577
01:02:45,980 --> 01:02:50,230
using beneficial microbes but in many

1578
01:02:48,380 --> 01:02:53,510
states that are still following the AHP

1579
01:02:50,230 --> 01:02:55,820
they have language in there that looks

1580
01:02:53,510 --> 01:02:57,650
like it forces you to use Petri films

1581
01:02:55,820 --> 01:02:59,210
which can't discern the two they try to

1582
01:02:57,650 --> 01:03:01,250
count things and colony forming units

1583
01:02:59,210 --> 01:03:03,980
and so you really can't discern

1584
01:03:01,250 --> 01:03:06,289
trichoderma from Aspergillus from these

1585
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:08,150
other harmful ones and the other thing

1586
01:03:06,289 --> 01:03:10,099
that we ran into very recently we were

1587
01:03:08,150 --> 01:03:12,170
doing a lot of sequencing with digi path

1588
01:03:10,099 --> 01:03:16,099
labs in Nevada trying to figure out when

1589
01:03:12,170 --> 01:03:19,220
molecular techniques differ from yeah

1590
01:03:16,099 --> 01:03:20,750
from from the actual plating that

1591
01:03:19,219 --> 01:03:22,549
happens and what we were finding is

1592
01:03:20,750 --> 01:03:25,639
there's a lot of rust onea that shows up

1593
01:03:22,550 --> 01:03:28,700
and real Stoney a is a is a bacteria

1594
01:03:25,639 --> 01:03:30,920
that lives inside of a fungus so it's an

1595
01:03:28,699 --> 01:03:32,719
endo fungal bacterial so when you try

1596
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:34,039
and plate this you don't you might get a

1597
01:03:32,719 --> 01:03:35,959
mold colony but you could have a

1598
01:03:34,039 --> 01:03:37,789
thousand you know of these pathogenic

1599
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:39,050
bacteria in it you won't be counting

1600
01:03:37,789 --> 01:03:42,409
those when you start counting colonies

1601
01:03:39,050 --> 01:03:45,050
so this thing also makes what's known as

1602
01:03:42,409 --> 01:03:48,559
a rise of toxin and so it's both the

1603
01:03:45,050 --> 01:03:51,230
human pathogen it causes plant wilt and

1604
01:03:48,559 --> 01:03:54,409
it also makes a mycotoxin so it's a

1605
01:03:51,230 --> 01:03:55,880
pretty nasty thing and it's sometimes a

1606
01:03:54,409 --> 01:03:56,989
days a lot of the the culturing

1607
01:03:55,880 --> 01:04:00,140
techniques because it likes to hang

1608
01:03:56,989 --> 01:04:02,809
outside of other fungi and Kevin is the

1609
01:04:00,139 --> 01:04:06,289
bacteria as a clump a lot is the

1610
01:04:02,809 --> 01:04:08,360
bacterium itself damaging to humans yes

1611
01:04:06,289 --> 01:04:12,079
there's something there's something

1612
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:14,480
called it has a disease name that's like

1613
01:04:12,079 --> 01:04:17,480
raus tinnitus or something where Estonia

1614
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:19,300
gets into their lungs and so it can be

1615
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:22,490
infected there are some cases of

1616
01:04:19,300 --> 01:04:23,480
of illness from this I don't know that

1617
01:04:22,489 --> 01:04:25,939
anything's been tied

1618
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:28,820
cannabis derived illness but they have

1619
01:04:25,940 --> 01:04:31,639
seen in hospitals and so it's usually

1620
01:04:28,820 --> 01:04:34,250
with like cystic fibrosis patients or

1621
01:04:31,639 --> 01:04:36,858
canvas patients I'm sorry I cancer

1622
01:04:34,250 --> 01:04:38,510
patients so it can't have some human

1623
01:04:36,858 --> 01:04:40,400
health and it can form it can you know

1624
01:04:38,510 --> 01:04:43,160
make the plants have some wilt as well

1625
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:45,559
so we've probably got to pick that one

1626
01:04:43,159 --> 01:04:48,319
up and make sure that we can discern it

1627
01:04:45,559 --> 01:04:50,119
from from fungi it does in fact ask for

1628
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:52,070
gilles and there's a there's a list of

1629
01:04:50,119 --> 01:04:54,079
like twenty different fungi that that it

1630
01:04:52,070 --> 01:04:55,580
does in fact then when it infects them

1631
01:04:54,079 --> 01:04:58,219
it makes them clump and form these

1632
01:04:55,579 --> 01:05:00,920
chlamydia spores which is one of these

1633
01:04:58,219 --> 01:05:02,149
survival modes if the fungi go into and

1634
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:03,889
that alone can make them really

1635
01:05:02,150 --> 01:05:06,470
difficult to quantitate because once the

1636
01:05:03,889 --> 01:05:07,909
fungi start to the clump when you put

1637
01:05:06,469 --> 01:05:09,319
them on plate you can't tell one colony

1638
01:05:07,909 --> 01:05:12,980
from a thousand they're there so good

1639
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:14,390
things not that lands on them so i think

1640
01:05:12,980 --> 01:05:16,010
that's really key for the whole

1641
01:05:14,389 --> 01:05:17,750
pesticide things i'm not very well

1642
01:05:16,010 --> 01:05:19,550
versed on all the pesticide limits and

1643
01:05:17,750 --> 01:05:21,739
then put in place yet in california but

1644
01:05:19,550 --> 01:05:23,060
i do know people were debating on the

1645
01:05:21,739 --> 01:05:25,669
parts per million of the parts per

1646
01:05:23,059 --> 01:05:28,130
billion but one thing we do see is a lot

1647
01:05:25,670 --> 01:05:29,840
of fungicide use and we're worried that

1648
01:05:28,130 --> 01:05:33,349
people are being driven to use

1649
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:35,269
fungicides because these plating systems

1650
01:05:33,349 --> 01:05:36,889
often give you false positives and tell

1651
01:05:35,269 --> 01:05:38,480
you that you have fungus when you don't

1652
01:05:36,889 --> 01:05:39,618
there's a lot of bacteria that grow on

1653
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:41,869
these plates and you can't really

1654
01:05:39,619 --> 01:05:42,950
discern them from the fungi so you know

1655
01:05:41,869 --> 01:05:44,900
if you're using the simplest and

1656
01:05:42,949 --> 01:05:47,750
trichoderma those could end up giving

1657
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:49,190
you false positives on these culturing

1658
01:05:47,750 --> 01:05:50,358
systems and that would signal the

1659
01:05:49,190 --> 01:05:51,769
growers hey you should use more

1660
01:05:50,358 --> 01:05:53,179
fungicides because you've gotta find

1661
01:05:51,769 --> 01:05:55,009
this problem when you really have just a

1662
01:05:53,179 --> 01:05:56,059
bacillus problem and you're in this is

1663
01:05:55,010 --> 01:06:01,160
actually probably your best thing to

1664
01:05:56,059 --> 01:06:04,029
fight against it so are they actually

1665
01:06:01,159 --> 01:06:06,319
using that in the soil or on the plant i

1666
01:06:04,030 --> 01:06:08,240
don't know how folks are using i'm

1667
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:09,859
assuming it comes up from the roots

1668
01:06:08,239 --> 01:06:13,608
because it's i think it's meant to be

1669
01:06:09,858 --> 01:06:15,500
helpful for nitrogen fixation my next

1670
01:06:13,608 --> 01:06:17,630
question how does he get on the plant if

1671
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:20,449
it's only applied in the soil that's how

1672
01:06:17,630 --> 01:06:22,039
we used yeah so a lot of these things

1673
01:06:20,449 --> 01:06:24,679
when they get into the roots they

1674
01:06:22,039 --> 01:06:26,570
actually vascular eyes like Fusarium

1675
01:06:24,679 --> 01:06:28,339
gets into the roots and vascular eyes is

1676
01:06:26,570 --> 01:06:30,019
all through the xylem and phloem and

1677
01:06:28,340 --> 01:06:31,789
we've been actually been doing biopsy

1678
01:06:30,019 --> 01:06:34,009
works throughout the plants figure out

1679
01:06:31,789 --> 01:06:36,019
the you know can we pick it up in the

1680
01:06:34,010 --> 01:06:36,480
leaves or do we have to do course core

1681
01:06:36,019 --> 01:06:38,759
preps

1682
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:40,469
well you take a whole bunch out of the

1683
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:43,170
stem to see if you can pick it up from

1684
01:06:40,469 --> 01:06:44,699
there but it does seem to be following

1685
01:06:43,170 --> 01:06:46,349
what you guys were writing about in that

1686
01:06:44,699 --> 01:06:48,029
book which is it comes in through the

1687
01:06:46,349 --> 01:06:50,910
through the roots and if you do stem

1688
01:06:48,030 --> 01:06:52,950
preps you can pick up Fusarium much more

1689
01:06:50,909 --> 01:06:54,149
of it than you can if you try and sample

1690
01:06:52,949 --> 01:06:56,250
it out the leaves

1691
01:06:54,150 --> 01:07:00,660
I think the still is slow to your point

1692
01:06:56,250 --> 01:07:02,130
Sam is that they are they tend to spray

1693
01:07:00,659 --> 01:07:05,489
that one on that's more like a foliar

1694
01:07:02,130 --> 01:07:07,170
spray for a lot of plants I see that at

1695
01:07:05,489 --> 01:07:08,429
like in products called serenade it's

1696
01:07:07,170 --> 01:07:10,139
something that you'll find the garden

1697
01:07:08,429 --> 01:07:13,618
source which is a facilitative brand

1698
01:07:10,139 --> 01:07:15,900
Lance so yeah they can be in different

1699
01:07:13,619 --> 01:07:18,930
places and sometimes I vascularized that

1700
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:21,269
sometimes or not we had a few cancer

1701
01:07:18,929 --> 01:07:23,779
patients die in California do you

1702
01:07:21,269 --> 01:07:26,219
remember that ATM is last year I believe

1703
01:07:23,780 --> 01:07:28,410
from fungal infections was that asked

1704
01:07:26,219 --> 01:07:29,608
for Julis do you know it was to them

1705
01:07:28,409 --> 01:07:30,929
yeah so they were concerned about

1706
01:07:29,608 --> 01:07:34,139
Aspergillus

1707
01:07:30,929 --> 01:07:35,489
Nucor and there's a couple other in that

1708
01:07:34,139 --> 01:07:38,578
paper I think Thompson is the one who

1709
01:07:35,489 --> 01:07:40,429
published that paper I'll try to XD I

1710
01:07:38,579 --> 01:07:43,140
can get that one for everybody and

1711
01:07:40,429 --> 01:07:44,578
that's why we wanted to test for pestis

1712
01:07:43,139 --> 01:07:46,259
I mean not only pesticides and

1713
01:07:44,579 --> 01:07:48,990
herbicides but also for fungus because

1714
01:07:46,260 --> 01:07:51,210
remember back in 2006 when I got an

1715
01:07:48,989 --> 01:07:53,639
upper respiratory infection we used all

1716
01:07:51,210 --> 01:07:56,550
our organic lepak testing to you know

1717
01:07:53,639 --> 01:07:58,019
that for our visual standpoint and I

1718
01:07:56,550 --> 01:07:59,550
still got sick which means there was

1719
01:07:58,019 --> 01:08:02,068
something microbial there that we

1720
01:07:59,550 --> 01:08:05,190
couldn't see so that's why you know in

1721
01:08:02,068 --> 01:08:07,769
one of the reasons why it took takes so

1722
01:08:05,190 --> 01:08:09,568
long is because it takes 72 hours for

1723
01:08:07,769 --> 01:08:11,369
playtests people that means it has to

1724
01:08:09,568 --> 01:08:12,599
they have to take it they have to put it

1725
01:08:11,369 --> 01:08:15,358
on a plate and it's got to sit there for

1726
01:08:12,599 --> 01:08:18,420
72 hours incubating so then it can pop

1727
01:08:15,358 --> 01:08:23,939
up so just to have a quick 24 hour test

1728
01:08:18,420 --> 01:08:25,980
it Kevin doesn't Elle quick oh yeah I do

1729
01:08:23,939 --> 01:08:30,689
it and I'm just giving a layman's term

1730
01:08:25,979 --> 01:08:32,338
for people I yeah we're using DNA to try

1731
01:08:30,689 --> 01:08:34,048
and find those things and there was

1732
01:08:32,338 --> 01:08:36,420
another one in Bakersfield actually that

1733
01:08:34,048 --> 01:08:39,750
just came out this year there was an

1734
01:08:36,420 --> 01:08:42,779
outbreak for cryptococcal meningitis in

1735
01:08:39,750 --> 01:08:43,969
a Bakersfield dispensary the patient

1736
01:08:42,779 --> 01:08:45,960
didn't die but the patient got

1737
01:08:43,969 --> 01:08:47,609
hospitalized with a with a lung

1738
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:49,220
infection that eventually ended up

1739
01:08:47,609 --> 01:08:51,230
getting to her brain

1740
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:53,810
so that's one that we probably have to

1741
01:08:51,229 --> 01:08:57,019
add the list because it has been seen a

1742
01:08:53,810 --> 01:09:01,970
lot of HIV patients and it's one that

1743
01:08:57,020 --> 01:09:03,950
it's not currently being tested for but

1744
01:09:01,970 --> 01:09:05,210
in fact I think they did nine more

1745
01:09:03,949 --> 01:09:07,609
sampling to the dispensary and found

1746
01:09:05,210 --> 01:09:09,170
that almost all of them but this was a

1747
01:09:07,609 --> 01:09:11,929
patient who was going in and buying the

1748
01:09:09,170 --> 01:09:15,460
cheapest blunts that they should like it

1749
01:09:11,930 --> 01:09:17,690
the pre-rolls and they were more or less

1750
01:09:15,460 --> 01:09:19,489
that was their habit as it always went

1751
01:09:17,689 --> 01:09:20,629
there probably three joints a day and

1752
01:09:19,489 --> 01:09:23,359
they were constantly getting kind of the

1753
01:09:20,630 --> 01:09:26,390
bottom of the barrel pre-rolls so yeah

1754
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:28,159
note to self you know the other thing is

1755
01:09:26,390 --> 01:09:30,289
I think that we're gonna be seeing way

1756
01:09:28,159 --> 01:09:32,539
more fungal infections and way more

1757
01:09:30,289 --> 01:09:34,729
bacterial infections of pathogens on

1758
01:09:32,539 --> 01:09:37,430
both humans and plants we're seeing it

1759
01:09:34,729 --> 01:09:39,019
in soils you know excuse me the more and

1760
01:09:37,430 --> 01:09:40,700
more soil tests that were that we're

1761
01:09:39,020 --> 01:09:42,710
getting back you know from all of these

1762
01:09:40,699 --> 01:09:44,630
farms all over is the aluminum rates are

1763
01:09:42,710 --> 01:09:46,609
going through the roof the iron rates

1764
01:09:44,630 --> 01:09:49,369
are going through the roof these heavy

1765
01:09:46,609 --> 01:09:53,539
metals that were dealing with are so

1766
01:09:49,369 --> 01:09:55,250
vast and all of the the phyto toxins and

1767
01:09:53,539 --> 01:09:57,949
chemicals that are happening are killing

1768
01:09:55,250 --> 01:10:00,920
our microbiome not only in our own body

1769
01:09:57,949 --> 01:10:03,019
but also on tent life and and in the in

1770
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:05,090
the eco sphere so I think that it's

1771
01:10:03,020 --> 01:10:07,070
really important that while we're still

1772
01:10:05,090 --> 01:10:09,350
looking at and defining all of these

1773
01:10:07,069 --> 01:10:11,029
different pathogens we need to also be

1774
01:10:09,350 --> 01:10:12,820
looking at beneficials and defining

1775
01:10:11,029 --> 01:10:14,719
beneficials and how they can be helpful

1776
01:10:12,819 --> 01:10:16,609
because I don't think that no matter

1777
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:18,440
what kind of science that we can throw

1778
01:10:16,609 --> 01:10:20,449
at it the most important thing is that

1779
01:10:18,439 --> 01:10:23,269
nature is going to take care of itself

1780
01:10:20,449 --> 01:10:25,159
and she has over and over again and I

1781
01:10:23,270 --> 01:10:27,140
believe that you know that's the real

1782
01:10:25,159 --> 01:10:29,809
solution and answer is there an L

1783
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:31,070
quicker way to do the DNA testing

1784
01:10:29,810 --> 01:10:32,630
because that seems to be the most

1785
01:10:31,069 --> 01:10:35,599
effective way to discern between

1786
01:10:32,630 --> 01:10:37,100
pathogenic and non-pathogenic and with

1787
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:38,810
bacillus itself I mean there's a

1788
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:40,370
thousand difference just you know that's

1789
01:10:38,810 --> 01:10:43,610
just a number I'm throwing up about many

1790
01:10:40,369 --> 01:10:45,500
difference between a bacillus we know

1791
01:10:43,609 --> 01:10:47,509
the bacillus isn't in the soil we know

1792
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:49,729
the bacillus is good in our intestines

1793
01:10:47,510 --> 01:10:52,880
and lower intestines and we have

1794
01:10:49,729 --> 01:10:55,459
bacillus in our natural mystic sprays

1795
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:58,279
and and and we find it really beneficial

1796
01:10:55,460 --> 01:11:01,670
but it can turn out to be a positive so

1797
01:10:58,279 --> 01:11:02,658
in general I avoided using sprays

1798
01:11:01,670 --> 01:11:05,600
because

1799
01:11:02,658 --> 01:11:08,569
the false positives that were coming up

1800
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:10,389
for beneficials I the last thing I was

1801
01:11:08,569 --> 01:11:15,109
using was BTI

1802
01:11:10,389 --> 01:11:17,150
again against caterpillars and luckily I

1803
01:11:15,109 --> 01:11:20,029
was only breeding I wasn't producing

1804
01:11:17,149 --> 01:11:23,869
medicine from people but I wondered what

1805
01:11:20,029 --> 01:11:26,238
was BT I would it pass the testing that

1806
01:11:23,869 --> 01:11:31,840
that is being done in the various states

1807
01:11:26,238 --> 01:11:35,779
now I don't know I'm not certain so

1808
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:37,429
Lister oh I think that was well yeah

1809
01:11:35,779 --> 01:11:39,500
that one would probably trigger a total

1810
01:11:37,429 --> 01:11:40,940
of robic count it wouldn't trigger

1811
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:42,979
anything in California because

1812
01:11:40,939 --> 01:11:45,349
California right now just has coli

1813
01:11:42,979 --> 01:11:46,789
Salmonella and 4s for jello species and

1814
01:11:45,350 --> 01:11:48,530
those we can do in a very targeted

1815
01:11:46,789 --> 01:11:50,779
manner we target weak right down to the

1816
01:11:48,529 --> 01:11:52,880
species level and that's important there

1817
01:11:50,779 --> 01:11:55,069
have been cases of Aspergillus failures

1818
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:56,929
that are disputed in Alaska there's that

1819
01:11:55,069 --> 01:11:59,658
there's speed up there between I think

1820
01:11:56,929 --> 01:12:01,190
one lab was calling it resilience s when

1821
01:11:59,658 --> 01:12:02,869
it was really asked for jealous it was

1822
01:12:01,189 --> 01:12:03,829
actually asked for the resilience but

1823
01:12:02,869 --> 01:12:05,569
they failed that thinking was

1824
01:12:03,829 --> 01:12:07,819
Aspergillus Niger because they couldn't

1825
01:12:05,569 --> 01:12:09,139
speciate it on a film and the lab that

1826
01:12:07,819 --> 01:12:11,599
was using DNA techniques could actually

1827
01:12:09,139 --> 01:12:14,000
differentiated so it can get you can get

1828
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:16,850
very very specific with a DNA test the

1829
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:18,829
hard thing to do with the DNA test is to

1830
01:12:16,850 --> 01:12:20,510
go after these these categories like

1831
01:12:18,829 --> 01:12:22,850
total Grove accounts and total yeast and

1832
01:12:20,510 --> 01:12:23,989
mold we do have a way to do that but

1833
01:12:22,850 --> 01:12:25,699
it's very hard to get it to be

1834
01:12:23,988 --> 01:12:28,099
concordant with the platings because the

1835
01:12:25,698 --> 01:12:29,769
platings don't necessarily select for

1836
01:12:28,100 --> 01:12:31,730
like the mold plates can grow bacteria

1837
01:12:29,770 --> 01:12:33,590
and so it makes it really hard if you

1838
01:12:31,729 --> 01:12:35,388
get a test that has it comes out with a

1839
01:12:33,590 --> 01:12:37,100
tentacle see if used for gram as a plate

1840
01:12:35,389 --> 01:12:40,340
because the plates have so many pitfalls

1841
01:12:37,100 --> 01:12:41,780
I mean 99% microbes don't culture there

1842
01:12:40,340 --> 01:12:43,460
just know how to culture them yet so

1843
01:12:41,779 --> 01:12:45,439
we're missing the vast majority of

1844
01:12:43,460 --> 01:12:48,289
microbiome when we slowly start using

1845
01:12:45,439 --> 01:12:50,599
those culture systems but we have made

1846
01:12:48,289 --> 01:12:52,399
tests that try to address the HP the HP

1847
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:54,350
has these guidelines that are written in

1848
01:12:52,399 --> 01:12:56,029
total aerobic counts and total yeast and

1849
01:12:54,350 --> 01:12:57,560
mold and those ones are very very vague

1850
01:12:56,029 --> 01:13:00,069
categories that we think actually do

1851
01:12:57,560 --> 01:13:00,070
more harm than good

1852
01:13:03,590 --> 01:13:08,000
[Music]

1853
01:13:05,679 --> 01:13:10,569
excellent conversation guys really

1854
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:13,698
really enjoying the in-depth

1855
01:13:10,569 --> 01:13:15,948
conversation on testing and bacteria and

1856
01:13:13,698 --> 01:13:17,809
just the health of cannabis in general

1857
01:13:15,948 --> 01:13:19,879
it is definitely a fight or remediate of

1858
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:28,880
plant it can pull things up out of the

1859
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:30,800
soil there's no doubt about it so I'm

1860
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:33,020
just gonna say quickly you know some of

1861
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:37,159
the things that that were brought up by

1862
01:13:33,020 --> 01:13:41,060
a dragonfly folks here is you know I

1863
01:13:37,158 --> 01:13:43,578
think the cannabis community is we learn

1864
01:13:41,060 --> 01:13:46,219
more about it will hopefully be expect

1865
01:13:43,578 --> 01:13:47,389
higher expectations out of what they

1866
01:13:46,219 --> 01:13:50,448
purchase I mean it's hard when people

1867
01:13:47,389 --> 01:13:51,828
are if they want cheap if they want low

1868
01:13:50,448 --> 01:13:54,229
quality you're gonna get it and that

1869
01:13:51,828 --> 01:13:57,229
risk is gonna come along with it but as

1870
01:13:54,229 --> 01:14:01,218
we understand more about the gut in the

1871
01:13:57,229 --> 01:14:03,709
microbiome how that is so closely

1872
01:14:01,219 --> 01:14:05,029
intertwined with neurological function

1873
01:14:03,710 --> 01:14:06,469
and we're learning more about the debt

1874
01:14:05,029 --> 01:14:09,050
in the brain and how its tied together

1875
01:14:06,469 --> 01:14:11,210
we can start to realize that if we

1876
01:14:09,050 --> 01:14:13,940
especially if we're using cannabis to

1877
01:14:11,210 --> 01:14:16,039
treat something medicinally that these

1878
01:14:13,939 --> 01:14:18,078
things aren't you know something that

1879
01:14:16,039 --> 01:14:20,899
you can separate you have to be able to

1880
01:14:18,078 --> 01:14:22,429
know that what you're doing to your the

1881
01:14:20,899 --> 01:14:25,598
things that affect your gut and your

1882
01:14:22,429 --> 01:14:27,500
body are going to also impact whatever

1883
01:14:25,599 --> 01:14:29,328
neurological thing you might be treating

1884
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:30,948
whether it be you know bipolar or

1885
01:14:29,328 --> 01:14:34,219
schizophrenic or mental health

1886
01:14:30,948 --> 01:14:36,169
conditions chronic migraine heaven

1887
01:14:34,219 --> 01:14:38,300
forbid seizure disorders you name them

1888
01:14:36,170 --> 01:14:40,429
all these things all these points are

1889
01:14:38,300 --> 01:14:43,460
important and I think if as people are

1890
01:14:40,429 --> 01:14:45,319
more educated as consumers hopefully

1891
01:14:43,460 --> 01:14:47,389
that expectation is translated into the

1892
01:14:45,319 --> 01:14:50,719
behavior of the people who are trying to

1893
01:14:47,389 --> 01:14:53,510
get their business and also you know

1894
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:56,328
becoming more educated on better health

1895
01:14:53,510 --> 01:14:58,699
and well-being I believe that you know

1896
01:14:56,328 --> 01:15:02,029
healthy soil does have all of the

1897
01:14:58,698 --> 01:15:04,848
answers to a healthy mind and body you

1898
01:15:02,029 --> 01:15:07,009
know it has all of the components that

1899
01:15:04,849 --> 01:15:09,230
it needs to be able to grow something

1900
01:15:07,010 --> 01:15:11,840
healthy in the same way that we can

1901
01:15:09,229 --> 01:15:14,149
easily look at soil and be able to mimic

1902
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:16,069
that you know bio structure that's

1903
01:15:14,149 --> 01:15:18,259
happening there and I believe that the

1904
01:15:16,069 --> 01:15:18,750
more that we look towards nature and the

1905
01:15:18,260 --> 01:15:20,940
more that we

1906
01:15:18,750 --> 01:15:22,890
have an understanding of what health

1907
01:15:20,939 --> 01:15:24,750
really looks like because it's been so

1908
01:15:22,890 --> 01:15:27,270
diminished over such a long period of

1909
01:15:24,750 --> 01:15:29,010
time then we really can grant gain that

1910
01:15:27,270 --> 01:15:31,350
intelligence I believe that we can't

1911
01:15:29,010 --> 01:15:33,329
even separate our intelligence from

1912
01:15:31,350 --> 01:15:37,340
Bennett from the beneficial microbiome

1913
01:15:33,329 --> 01:15:39,390
that's going on within ourselves as well

1914
01:15:37,340 --> 01:15:41,430
yeah there's a lot of work coming out

1915
01:15:39,390 --> 01:15:42,840
now showing that your your gut flora

1916
01:15:41,430 --> 01:15:44,970
have a big impact on things like

1917
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:46,590
Parkinson's and Alzheimer's and all

1918
01:15:44,970 --> 01:15:48,510
these chronic diseases when they start

1919
01:15:46,590 --> 01:15:53,400
doing fecal transplants they see very

1920
01:15:48,510 --> 01:15:55,590
very striking results yeah the fecal

1921
01:15:53,399 --> 01:15:57,449
implants have been really important Ida

1922
01:15:55,590 --> 01:15:59,430
and I believe that you know we're really

1923
01:15:57,449 --> 01:16:01,739
trying to do the same thing I always go

1924
01:15:59,430 --> 01:16:04,079
back and forth from health to soil and

1925
01:16:01,739 --> 01:16:05,699
plants to health I can't really separate

1926
01:16:04,079 --> 01:16:07,229
them and I believe that you know what

1927
01:16:05,699 --> 01:16:08,460
they're doing with fecal implants is

1928
01:16:07,229 --> 01:16:10,529
sort of the same thing that we're doing

1929
01:16:08,460 --> 01:16:12,829
with remediation of soil when we're

1930
01:16:10,529 --> 01:16:15,179
adding a massive amount of beneficial

1931
01:16:12,829 --> 01:16:16,890
microbiology into a soil to remediate it

1932
01:16:15,180 --> 01:16:19,170
it's the same way that these fecal

1933
01:16:16,890 --> 01:16:21,510
implants are really gaining a great

1934
01:16:19,170 --> 01:16:23,460
momentum because you know Department of

1935
01:16:21,510 --> 01:16:25,170
Agriculture hasn't really given those

1936
01:16:23,460 --> 01:16:28,289
incredible studies they haven't looked

1937
01:16:25,170 --> 01:16:29,539
beyond you know necessarily the NPK you

1938
01:16:28,289 --> 01:16:33,210
know we're just learning about

1939
01:16:29,539 --> 01:16:35,100
dissecting DNA of fungi and bacteria and

1940
01:16:33,210 --> 01:16:36,840
I believe that you know once we're

1941
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:38,970
starting to see it within human health

1942
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:41,610
we're gonna really start to understand

1943
01:16:38,970 --> 01:16:44,640
it even more because more money is put

1944
01:16:41,609 --> 01:16:46,349
towards human health and understanding

1945
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:48,960
the microbiome in there and the more

1946
01:16:46,350 --> 01:16:50,910
work and research that we do in that

1947
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:52,829
area you know the more that we're going

1948
01:16:50,909 --> 01:16:54,149
to gain the intelligence that we need to

1949
01:16:52,829 --> 01:16:57,390
be able to overcome all of these

1950
01:16:54,149 --> 01:16:59,250
pathogens that we're talking about yeah

1951
01:16:57,390 --> 01:17:02,340
so there is a study out from CDC

1952
01:16:59,250 --> 01:17:04,800
recently in OSHA getting a little bit

1953
01:17:02,340 --> 01:17:08,310
concerned over the Canada's trimming

1954
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:10,980
Environment posted up right here so they

1955
01:17:08,310 --> 01:17:14,420
evaluated the health hazards of that

1956
01:17:10,979 --> 01:17:17,879
that trimming grants might run into and

1957
01:17:14,420 --> 01:17:19,319
this is the results of this which is

1958
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:21,060
that there's high exposure to I guess

1959
01:17:19,319 --> 01:17:24,359
powdery mildew which I think you were

1960
01:17:21,060 --> 01:17:27,180
just showing off some mycelium and and

1961
01:17:24,359 --> 01:17:30,089
also to botrytis I don't know why that's

1962
01:17:27,180 --> 01:17:31,530
gonna go but there was a case here in

1963
01:17:30,090 --> 01:17:32,699
Massachusetts where one of the employees

1964
01:17:31,529 --> 01:17:34,679
sued

1965
01:17:32,699 --> 01:17:36,239
I can't remember which company was the

1966
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:37,710
one of the growers here is getting sued

1967
01:17:36,239 --> 01:17:43,109
by employee because they broke down

1968
01:17:37,710 --> 01:17:44,640
rashes the trimming room and problem we

1969
01:17:43,109 --> 01:17:46,170
have here is some of the testing labs

1970
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:48,360
are using culturing which doesn't

1971
01:17:46,170 --> 01:17:49,619
actually culture botrytis or PM so they

1972
01:17:48,359 --> 01:17:51,420
can't really see the problem and help

1973
01:17:49,619 --> 01:17:55,470
guide that the dispensary or the grower

1974
01:17:51,420 --> 01:17:55,890
on this so it's a yeah bit of an issue

1975
01:17:55,470 --> 01:17:58,920
here

1976
01:17:55,890 --> 01:18:01,710
you tube sorry what about the use of

1977
01:17:58,920 --> 01:18:04,529
isopropyl alcohol and it's buildup on

1978
01:18:01,710 --> 01:18:06,890
the liver and is there alternatives that

1979
01:18:04,529 --> 01:18:09,239
people can use besides isopropyl alcohol

1980
01:18:06,890 --> 01:18:11,940
doesn't everyone you people will be

1981
01:18:09,239 --> 01:18:15,539
using in oils and in ethanol didn't

1982
01:18:11,939 --> 01:18:16,889
hazen camp paper shown in like olive oil

1983
01:18:15,539 --> 01:18:18,539
or probably some of the best things for

1984
01:18:16,890 --> 01:18:24,030
extracting and keeping all the terpenes

1985
01:18:18,539 --> 01:18:33,899
i agree with that in lipid extraction is

1986
01:18:24,029 --> 01:18:36,809
amazing i mean i think that yeah yeah i

1987
01:18:33,899 --> 01:18:37,979
won't let any of our kids or the

1988
01:18:36,810 --> 01:18:41,370
families to work with get anywhere near

1989
01:18:37,979 --> 01:18:42,689
isopropyl at all so i see some people

1990
01:18:41,369 --> 01:18:46,349
doing it once in a while but you know

1991
01:18:42,689 --> 01:18:48,269
it's kind of like when you know RSO was

1992
01:18:46,350 --> 01:18:50,220
first getting sort of some attention in

1993
01:18:48,270 --> 01:18:51,630
naphtha was used all the time you know

1994
01:18:50,220 --> 01:18:54,119
and it just started to trickle to

1995
01:18:51,630 --> 01:18:56,039
isopropyl and now the isopropyl is

1996
01:18:54,119 --> 01:18:57,599
thankfully dying off and don't see it

1997
01:18:56,039 --> 01:19:00,029
very much but I'd be careful with

1998
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:01,410
naphtha it has rust and lead inhibitor

1999
01:19:00,029 --> 01:19:03,359
that's put into it it's kind of a

2000
01:19:01,409 --> 01:19:05,220
greenish bluish tinge and you really

2001
01:19:03,359 --> 01:19:07,380
have to run that through a still and and

2002
01:19:05,220 --> 01:19:09,750
and clean that up I obviously I'm not

2003
01:19:07,380 --> 01:19:12,029
using many solvents at all when I'm

2004
01:19:09,750 --> 01:19:14,550
extracting but definitely if you're

2005
01:19:12,029 --> 01:19:16,050
going to you should try to try to get

2006
01:19:14,550 --> 01:19:18,119
them as clean as possible and I just

2007
01:19:16,050 --> 01:19:19,829
wanted to add in the middle of this

2008
01:19:18,119 --> 01:19:22,229
great conversation that I do have

2009
01:19:19,829 --> 01:19:24,630
Hillary black stopping by really briefly

2010
01:19:22,229 --> 01:19:26,549
she's doing a old woman's panel today at

2011
01:19:24,630 --> 01:19:28,199
lift but she's gonna stop in just for 15

2012
01:19:26,550 --> 01:19:31,829
or 20 minutes and tell us a little bit

2013
01:19:28,199 --> 01:19:34,710
about her recent conversations she had

2014
01:19:31,829 --> 01:19:37,859
with the Senate here in Canada in

2015
01:19:34,710 --> 01:19:40,010
Ontario in Ottawa our capital city and

2016
01:19:37,859 --> 01:19:41,789
so she'll be here in a little bit so

2017
01:19:40,010 --> 01:19:43,140
unfortunately I won't want to be rude

2018
01:19:41,789 --> 01:19:44,609
but when she gets here wherever our

2019
01:19:43,140 --> 01:19:45,550
conversation is we're just gonna pause

2020
01:19:44,609 --> 01:19:48,158
let

2021
01:19:45,550 --> 01:19:49,809
say her piece and then get to what she

2022
01:19:48,158 --> 01:19:54,420
has to do because of course she's very

2023
01:19:49,809 --> 01:19:54,420
busy so I just wanted to add that

2024
01:19:57,328 --> 01:20:04,359
awesome yeah it should be good

2025
01:20:02,139 --> 01:20:06,520
should be good I'm always and what about

2026
01:20:04,359 --> 01:20:08,078
you Micah you have anything to add today

2027
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:10,059
you've been very quiet but I see you

2028
01:20:08,078 --> 01:20:12,488
there sitting and listening and feeling

2029
01:20:10,059 --> 01:20:15,550
intrigued yeah another conversation is

2030
01:20:12,488 --> 01:20:18,250
good I was having Samara computer issues

2031
01:20:15,550 --> 01:20:20,079
there for a while so I missed the front

2032
01:20:18,250 --> 01:20:21,210
half of the conversation but uh can you

2033
01:20:20,078 --> 01:20:25,328
guys hear me already

2034
01:20:21,210 --> 01:20:26,920
absolutely okay yeah one of the things

2035
01:20:25,328 --> 01:20:29,828
you know Erik kind of touched down a

2036
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:31,270
little bit and you know that I've

2037
01:20:29,828 --> 01:20:36,759
noticed a lot over the last couple years

2038
01:20:31,270 --> 01:20:39,040
when it comes to testing and pesticide

2039
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:40,719
use and all that one of the things we've

2040
01:20:39,039 --> 01:20:44,019
got this distribution company we've been

2041
01:20:40,719 --> 01:20:47,380
working on out of Mendocino and we're

2042
01:20:44,020 --> 01:20:50,770
testing flower and trim all you know all

2043
01:20:47,380 --> 01:20:53,618
the time hundreds of test results off of

2044
01:20:50,770 --> 01:20:55,239
all these different forms and we thought

2045
01:20:53,618 --> 01:20:59,769
that you know as all these bigger farms

2046
01:20:55,238 --> 01:21:01,178
came on lawn down in Salinas and that we

2047
01:20:59,770 --> 01:21:02,980
you know maybe it would be a good idea

2048
01:21:01,179 --> 01:21:05,170
for us to get down in that area and

2049
01:21:02,979 --> 01:21:07,149
start testing some of that material what

2050
01:21:05,170 --> 01:21:10,029
we found is that most that material down

2051
01:21:07,149 --> 01:21:12,969
there was dirty and for that and it's

2052
01:21:10,029 --> 01:21:15,399
not so much that that the forms

2053
01:21:12,969 --> 01:21:17,109
themselves are that they're not you know

2054
01:21:15,399 --> 01:21:18,578
their practices are good but they've got

2055
01:21:17,109 --> 01:21:20,139
these neighbors that are down the road

2056
01:21:18,578 --> 01:21:22,988
that are contaminating all of their

2057
01:21:20,139 --> 01:21:25,359
product and so it got to the point where

2058
01:21:22,988 --> 01:21:27,069
you know I agree with what Eric was

2059
01:21:25,359 --> 01:21:28,479
saying it's like there there's something

2060
01:21:27,069 --> 01:21:30,069
to be said for these farms that are in

2061
01:21:28,479 --> 01:21:32,348
Humboldt - you know Grass Valley view's

2062
01:21:30,069 --> 01:21:34,198
like more out-of-the-way areas where

2063
01:21:32,349 --> 01:21:37,449
it's easier to keep your product clean

2064
01:21:34,198 --> 01:21:39,039
um yeah that's rough having your

2065
01:21:37,448 --> 01:21:41,229
neighbor jump in the helicopter and

2066
01:21:39,039 --> 01:21:43,750
spray a couple of metric gallons of a

2067
01:21:41,229 --> 01:21:45,609
vyd is just like my skin was crawling

2068
01:21:43,750 --> 01:21:49,448
when he was saying that I was just like

2069
01:21:45,609 --> 01:21:51,939
that's that's heinous there's more

2070
01:21:49,448 --> 01:21:54,488
greenhouses standing around when the I

2071
01:21:51,939 --> 01:21:56,078
guess there was a shipment of the

2072
01:21:54,488 --> 01:21:58,238
average showed up and it went to the

2073
01:21:56,078 --> 01:21:58,569
rock it went to the growers address and

2074
01:21:58,238 --> 01:22:01,269
it was

2075
01:21:58,569 --> 01:22:03,849
the neighbors and so all these growers

2076
01:22:01,270 --> 01:22:06,489
are standing around going whose palette

2077
01:22:03,849 --> 01:22:10,539
I have it is this there was like not me

2078
01:22:06,488 --> 01:22:12,519
not me but yeah sure enough it went to

2079
01:22:10,539 --> 01:22:15,670
the guy next door with the helicopter no

2080
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:18,790
less of in everybody's there suffering

2081
01:22:15,670 --> 01:22:20,170
from avid shame that's one of the

2082
01:22:18,789 --> 01:22:22,090
concerns that we see in some of the

2083
01:22:20,170 --> 01:22:24,819
counties here in California's are really

2084
01:22:22,090 --> 01:22:26,159
trying to push it out of the hills right

2085
01:22:24,819 --> 01:22:32,130
they want to get it more to the flat

2086
01:22:26,158 --> 01:22:32,129
agricultural lands and you know idols

2087
01:22:33,238 --> 01:22:39,399
it did cabbage some other you know

2088
01:22:37,420 --> 01:22:41,230
commodity that you can put next to those

2089
01:22:39,399 --> 01:22:44,229
really know the Central Valley in

2090
01:22:41,229 --> 01:22:46,419
California has been sprayed for decades

2091
01:22:44,229 --> 01:22:49,659
you know there's like we've said there's

2092
01:22:46,420 --> 01:22:52,539
no clean place just with the wind alone

2093
01:22:49,659 --> 01:22:53,979
and this whole push to get it sort of

2094
01:22:52,539 --> 01:22:55,689
out of the hills one of the reasons that

2095
01:22:53,979 --> 01:22:57,428
can the cannabis is so clean just like

2096
01:22:55,689 --> 01:22:59,678
we've just said here in Nevada County

2097
01:22:57,429 --> 01:23:01,239
and up in Humboldt Mendocino is that

2098
01:22:59,679 --> 01:23:03,760
there isn't that sort of other

2099
01:23:01,238 --> 01:23:07,119
agricultural farmland that it just has a

2100
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:10,000
culture of just spraying whatever you

2101
01:23:07,119 --> 01:23:11,229
know it's been it's been nasty so I hope

2102
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,850
that people who are in those counties

2103
01:23:11,229 --> 01:23:15,698
when they start to hear that push

2104
01:23:12,850 --> 01:23:17,739
understand how that push to kind of

2105
01:23:15,698 --> 01:23:19,839
uproot the culture of cannabis in the

2106
01:23:17,738 --> 01:23:21,369
hills of Northern California is also

2107
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:24,579
going to equal to a really difficult

2108
01:23:21,369 --> 01:23:25,960
time sourcing and finding the quality of

2109
01:23:24,579 --> 01:23:27,309
cannabis and clean canvas you need

2110
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:28,810
because it's gonna take years to clean

2111
01:23:27,310 --> 01:23:31,480
up some of these places before I would

2112
01:23:28,810 --> 01:23:33,100
touch what's being grown yeah but do you

2113
01:23:31,479 --> 01:23:34,839
then you've got places like Calaveras

2114
01:23:33,100 --> 01:23:36,969
County that open up their doors and then

2115
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:38,980
shut their doors so that's where do

2116
01:23:36,969 --> 01:23:41,529
these people go you're literally through

2117
01:23:38,979 --> 01:23:43,928
prohibition of local you know locality

2118
01:23:41,529 --> 01:23:45,488
is forcing these people into going into

2119
01:23:43,929 --> 01:23:47,500
Central Valley into going into the

2120
01:23:45,488 --> 01:23:50,289
regular agricultural areas because of

2121
01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:52,000
the you know the fear of prohibition or

2122
01:23:50,289 --> 01:23:54,609
whatever the hell happened in Calaveras

2123
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:58,779
County which you know it should be a

2124
01:23:54,609 --> 01:24:00,729
wake-up call and a realistic focusing of

2125
01:23:58,779 --> 01:24:02,829
everybody no matter what [ __ ] county

2126
01:24:00,729 --> 01:24:04,750
you in you need to stay on top of what's

2127
01:24:02,829 --> 01:24:07,510
actually going on and stay in tune and

2128
01:24:04,750 --> 01:24:11,260
plugged yourself in you know if you know

2129
01:24:07,510 --> 01:24:13,840
I'm I hear people say you know I'm so

2130
01:24:11,260 --> 01:24:16,390
tired of you know I I don't really think

2131
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:18,219
about you know you know voting and doing

2132
01:24:16,390 --> 01:24:20,440
things like that well you know what you

2133
01:24:18,219 --> 01:24:23,920
know you may not think politics involves

2134
01:24:20,439 --> 01:24:25,809
you but you know your boss is involved

2135
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:27,609
in politics your landlords involved in

2136
01:24:25,810 --> 01:24:29,530
politics your insurance companies are

2137
01:24:27,609 --> 01:24:31,420
involved in politics and all they're

2138
01:24:29,529 --> 01:24:33,670
doing is using their political will to

2139
01:24:31,420 --> 01:24:36,429
make their lives much more comfortable

2140
01:24:33,670 --> 01:24:38,260
so if you don't think that you have any

2141
01:24:36,429 --> 01:24:39,969
reason to be involved you better check

2142
01:24:38,260 --> 01:24:42,190
yourself because all kinds of people

2143
01:24:39,969 --> 01:24:43,899
wasted hundreds of thousands if not

2144
01:24:42,189 --> 01:24:46,750
millions of dollars investing in

2145
01:24:43,899 --> 01:24:48,759
Calaveras County only have their door

2146
01:24:46,750 --> 01:24:50,949
shut on them in the county said [ __ ] off

2147
01:24:48,760 --> 01:24:52,600
I don't think people realize how much

2148
01:24:50,949 --> 01:24:54,760
influence they have if they're you know

2149
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:57,370
there's just apathy that we just can't

2150
01:24:54,760 --> 01:25:00,130
do anything and that's just not true

2151
01:24:57,369 --> 01:25:02,019
I mean it is work though you know we

2152
01:25:00,130 --> 01:25:04,569
were in Nevada County we were all out

2153
01:25:02,020 --> 01:25:06,370
ban they were put it on the measure just

2154
01:25:04,569 --> 01:25:08,139
specifically to make it so that the

2155
01:25:06,369 --> 01:25:11,170
Future Board of Supervisors couldn't

2156
01:25:08,140 --> 01:25:14,380
change it right that's how much of a man

2157
01:25:11,170 --> 01:25:16,690
they wanted to implement here and you

2158
01:25:14,380 --> 01:25:19,539
know with a lot of activism and a lot of

2159
01:25:16,689 --> 01:25:22,000
work we were able to defeat it and can

2160
01:25:19,539 --> 01:25:23,829
didn't stop from there and now we're at

2161
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:25,090
a point where you know we are having

2162
01:25:23,829 --> 01:25:26,920
ordinances coming up it's going to be

2163
01:25:25,090 --> 01:25:29,560
issuing commercial licenses you know

2164
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:31,090
from the place with Placer County and

2165
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:33,100
all around the Sierra County where were

2166
01:25:31,090 --> 01:25:35,590
everywhere is in the band and but it

2167
01:25:33,100 --> 01:25:37,660
went from work we would absolutely just

2168
01:25:35,590 --> 01:25:40,420
be in a band if we sat at home and said

2169
01:25:37,659 --> 01:25:41,889
hey this sucks it's not fair and the

2170
01:25:40,420 --> 01:25:44,319
same on the state level we started

2171
01:25:41,890 --> 01:25:46,600
applying that at the state level and you

2172
01:25:44,319 --> 01:25:48,549
know in the BCC we haven't gotten into

2173
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:50,950
this too much but we're looking at and

2174
01:25:48,550 --> 01:25:53,529
helping develop new license types we're

2175
01:25:50,949 --> 01:25:55,300
looking to actually shape what cannabis

2176
01:25:53,529 --> 01:25:57,009
is going to look like you know and

2177
01:25:55,300 --> 01:25:59,050
that's you know what cannabis looks like

2178
01:25:57,010 --> 01:26:01,480
now in our communities it's not what it

2179
01:25:59,050 --> 01:26:03,190
should have or would look like if we

2180
01:26:01,479 --> 01:26:05,109
hadn't had prohibition what we have now

2181
01:26:03,189 --> 01:26:07,989
it's just like in the you know I'd like

2182
01:26:05,109 --> 01:26:10,539
to equate it is this this beautiful you

2183
01:26:07,989 --> 01:26:12,880
know girl who a child that was locked in

2184
01:26:10,539 --> 01:26:14,439
a basement for 40 years right

2185
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:15,909
and we kind of opened the door and let

2186
01:26:14,439 --> 01:26:17,589
her out and she comes out so yeah I

2187
01:26:15,909 --> 01:26:19,630
can't see it's bright and we think that

2188
01:26:17,590 --> 01:26:22,720
that's we're just gonna make that legal

2189
01:26:19,630 --> 01:26:23,859
now and continue to do that you know we

2190
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:25,720
are at a point now where we can

2191
01:26:23,859 --> 01:26:27,250
absolutely shake how cannabis is

2192
01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:30,310
integrated into our lives and into our

2193
01:26:27,250 --> 01:26:32,439
communities and we absolutely do have

2194
01:26:30,310 --> 01:26:34,870
influence I've been actually pretty

2195
01:26:32,439 --> 01:26:37,329
shocked about how much progress we've

2196
01:26:34,869 --> 01:26:40,059
been able to make just making time to go

2197
01:26:37,329 --> 01:26:42,489
to Sacramento to speak with lawmakers to

2198
01:26:40,060 --> 01:26:44,170
go to the meetings we have influence

2199
01:26:42,489 --> 01:26:46,239
it's just are we going to complain about

2200
01:26:44,170 --> 01:26:48,730
the way things are or are we going to be

2201
01:26:46,239 --> 01:26:51,429
the generation that shapes the way it is

2202
01:26:48,729 --> 01:26:53,769
in the future and you know I know what

2203
01:26:51,430 --> 01:26:56,860
side I face it's it's a beautiful segue

2204
01:26:53,770 --> 01:26:59,200
into what Hillary is here to talk to us

2205
01:26:56,859 --> 01:26:59,979
about actually Forrest so I want to

2206
01:26:59,199 --> 01:27:02,139
welcome Hillary

2207
01:26:59,979 --> 01:27:04,509
back into the first hash Church after a

2208
01:27:02,140 --> 01:27:09,520
hundred and forty days it's gonna tell

2209
01:27:04,510 --> 01:27:14,920
us a little bit early hi Heather a love

2210
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:18,160
you baby oh I was thinking about this

2211
01:27:14,920 --> 01:27:21,220
community we had the opportunity to

2212
01:27:18,159 --> 01:27:22,899
speak to the Senate last week so our

2213
01:27:21,220 --> 01:27:25,510
legalization bill is being reviewed by

2214
01:27:22,899 --> 01:27:30,149
the Senate in Canada right now and they

2215
01:27:25,510 --> 01:27:32,260
are there's a lot of movement around

2216
01:27:30,149 --> 01:27:34,149
pushing back on some really key key

2217
01:27:32,260 --> 01:27:37,180
things some of the senators wanted to

2218
01:27:34,149 --> 01:27:38,738
repeal the home grow aspect of the bill

2219
01:27:37,180 --> 01:27:41,680
and they had been talking a lot about

2220
01:27:38,738 --> 01:27:43,929
putting a potency caps in there even

2221
01:27:41,680 --> 01:27:45,010
talking about like limiting the potency

2222
01:27:43,930 --> 01:27:47,200
of flowers that were allowed to

2223
01:27:45,010 --> 01:27:50,260
distribute not even yet really wrapping

2224
01:27:47,199 --> 01:27:52,238
their head around resins and other kinds

2225
01:27:50,260 --> 01:27:54,039
of concentrates and so there were many

2226
01:27:52,238 --> 01:27:55,779
many things that I wanted to speak to

2227
01:27:54,039 --> 01:27:58,090
them about but you only get seven

2228
01:27:55,779 --> 01:27:59,649
minutes and it's really hard to like

2229
01:27:58,090 --> 01:28:02,529
hone it all down into seven minutes so

2230
01:27:59,649 --> 01:28:06,488
the two things that I focused on was tax

2231
01:28:02,529 --> 01:28:08,949
and potency so on the tax side our

2232
01:28:06,488 --> 01:28:10,659
government already charges a sales tax

2233
01:28:08,949 --> 01:28:12,550
to medical patients and now they're

2234
01:28:10,659 --> 01:28:15,789
applying an excise tax act which is

2235
01:28:12,550 --> 01:28:18,579
basically a sin tax to cannabis for

2236
01:28:15,789 --> 01:28:20,920
recreational and they're proposing to

2237
01:28:18,579 --> 01:28:21,850
put it on patients and so that was sort

2238
01:28:20,920 --> 01:28:23,230
of a really big thing that we're

2239
01:28:21,850 --> 01:28:24,579
fighting back because so many patients

2240
01:28:23,229 --> 01:28:25,659
says you guys know can't afford the

2241
01:28:24,579 --> 01:28:27,579
amount of cannabis that they need

2242
01:28:25,659 --> 01:28:30,569
already and we should not be putting a

2243
01:28:27,579 --> 01:28:33,309
sin tax on medicine for patients but the

2244
01:28:30,569 --> 01:28:34,569
potency conversation was also really

2245
01:28:33,310 --> 01:28:36,340
interesting because you have to remember

2246
01:28:34,569 --> 01:28:38,109
that these senators are kind of in like

2247
01:28:36,340 --> 01:28:39,970
kindergarten around their cannabis

2248
01:28:38,109 --> 01:28:42,309
knowledge and it's really easy to be

2249
01:28:39,970 --> 01:28:45,760
angry and frustrated that they don't get

2250
01:28:42,310 --> 01:28:47,739
certain things or be patient and try to

2251
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:50,949
meet them where they are in terms of

2252
01:28:47,738 --> 01:28:52,029
their level of understanding so one of

2253
01:28:50,949 --> 01:28:53,559
the things that I think is always

2254
01:28:52,029 --> 01:28:55,359
interesting to talk about around photos

2255
01:28:53,560 --> 01:28:57,730
be that so many people don't know it's

2256
01:28:55,359 --> 01:29:00,369
like my favorite fun fact these days is

2257
01:28:57,729 --> 01:29:01,599
around how we have very few cannabinoid

2258
01:29:00,369 --> 01:29:03,699
receptors in our brain stem and our

2259
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:05,289
brain stem is responsible for cardiac

2260
01:29:03,699 --> 01:29:07,300
and respiratory function and that's why

2261
01:29:05,289 --> 01:29:09,519
unlike opiates and alcohol cannabis

2262
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:11,260
can't actually kill you so I talked to

2263
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:12,550
them about how using the word overdose

2264
01:29:11,260 --> 01:29:15,219
with cannabis is not

2265
01:29:12,550 --> 01:29:17,440
actually appropriate because the word

2266
01:29:15,219 --> 01:29:20,618
overdose insinuates that death is

2267
01:29:17,439 --> 01:29:22,658
possible because they had had like a lot

2268
01:29:20,618 --> 01:29:24,429
of the people that came to testify it

2269
01:29:22,658 --> 01:29:26,679
was kinda like in in your time machine

2270
01:29:24,429 --> 01:29:29,529
and go back to 1962 level of knowledge

2271
01:29:26,679 --> 01:29:30,789
and and prohibitionist rhetoric that

2272
01:29:29,529 --> 01:29:34,779
they are hearing from they even had a

2273
01:29:30,789 --> 01:29:37,929
visit from sam the like America's like

2274
01:29:34,779 --> 01:29:39,609
super conservative doesn't even really

2275
01:29:37,929 --> 01:29:43,569
get any traction anywhere in America

2276
01:29:39,609 --> 01:29:45,130
prohibitionists we had yeah a couple of

2277
01:29:43,569 --> 01:29:46,868
our conservative senators actually went

2278
01:29:45,130 --> 01:29:49,900
down and spent the afternoon with Jeff

2279
01:29:46,868 --> 01:29:54,130
Sessions so this kind of influence on

2280
01:29:49,899 --> 01:29:56,828
our process is infuriating to say the

2281
01:29:54,130 --> 01:29:58,599
least but so we had a lot of work to do

2282
01:29:56,828 --> 01:30:03,519
to address some of the misinformation

2283
01:29:58,599 --> 01:30:05,860
that they had received so the I was

2284
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:08,130
gonna tell you talking about potency and

2285
01:30:05,859 --> 01:30:10,750
extracts talked about the brainstem and

2286
01:30:08,130 --> 01:30:13,150
also just you know explaining the super

2287
01:30:10,750 --> 01:30:14,979
basics that you all know that if you're

2288
01:30:13,149 --> 01:30:16,420
using like the Tri Chrome's by

2289
01:30:14,979 --> 01:30:18,339
themselves it can just mean that you

2290
01:30:16,420 --> 01:30:20,408
consume less plant matter and what that

2291
01:30:18,340 --> 01:30:22,119
means for patients and talking about the

2292
01:30:20,408 --> 01:30:23,738
difference between like smoking the

2293
01:30:22,118 --> 01:30:25,779
whole joint or if you want to like

2294
01:30:23,738 --> 01:30:28,238
having one inhalation off like an

2295
01:30:25,779 --> 01:30:32,439
elegant vape pen but I think that we

2296
01:30:28,238 --> 01:30:35,169
really got the messages across around

2297
01:30:32,439 --> 01:30:37,629
potency and the fact that what they are

2298
01:30:35,170 --> 01:30:39,969
wanting to achieve through potency

2299
01:30:37,630 --> 01:30:41,920
limits it's not gonna work

2300
01:30:39,969 --> 01:30:44,020
that they need to just regulate all of

2301
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:45,819
the products all the potencies and then

2302
01:30:44,020 --> 01:30:48,130
we can deal with them in a responsible

2303
01:30:45,819 --> 01:30:51,460
way in the marketplace and so I kind of

2304
01:30:48,130 --> 01:30:55,569
felt like I had my like hash Church flag

2305
01:30:51,460 --> 01:30:57,609
with me when I was out there so I'm

2306
01:30:55,569 --> 01:30:59,529
happy to pop in and say hi and glad that

2307
01:30:57,609 --> 01:31:00,789
you're back on the air oh man we were

2308
01:30:59,529 --> 01:31:02,769
just going on about it for the first

2309
01:31:00,789 --> 01:31:05,349
half an hour how great it is to see all

2310
01:31:02,770 --> 01:31:08,050
the familiar happy faces and here Indy

2311
01:31:05,349 --> 01:31:11,440
420 case a bong ripp was like the

2312
01:31:08,050 --> 01:31:14,199
opening bell for church I see I watched

2313
01:31:11,439 --> 01:31:15,519

about and everything there and you guys

2315
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:20,660
touched on levels of

2316
01:31:17,210 --> 01:31:22,310
being close in age like the under-17 and

2317
01:31:20,659 --> 01:31:25,309
getting the criminal record and stuff

2318
01:31:22,310 --> 01:31:27,260
like that and you guys did an incredible

2319
01:31:25,310 --> 01:31:30,560
job you guys look so professional up

2320
01:31:27,260 --> 01:31:32,720
there and it was cool them all hey you

2321
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:34,970

2322
01:31:32,720 --> 01:31:37,490
you thank you yeah it was it was pretty

2323
01:31:34,970 --> 01:31:40,610
amazing to see like team legalization

2324
01:31:37,489 --> 01:31:42,409
get our chance up at that and we got the

2325
01:31:40,609 --> 01:31:43,880
last word because they start doing the

2326
01:31:42,409 --> 01:31:47,119
line by Luanne through the act and

2327
01:31:43,880 --> 01:31:50,779
proposing their amendments next week and

2328
01:31:47,119 --> 01:31:52,819
both of those panels from that day are

2329
01:31:50,779 --> 01:31:53,899
super worth watching and the Q&amp;A is

2330
01:31:52,819 --> 01:31:55,309
really interesting I mean not that

2331
01:31:53,899 --> 01:31:57,109
anybody here is really interested in

2332
01:31:55,310 --> 01:31:58,460
like cannabis politics and policies but

2333
01:31:57,109 --> 01:32:01,839
if you happen to be somebody who is

2334
01:31:58,460 --> 01:32:05,420
vaguely interested in that kind of stuff

2335
01:32:01,840 --> 01:32:09,949
the Q&amp;A is super interesting to watch

2336
01:32:05,420 --> 01:32:11,480
and I just I want us to get it right you

2337
01:32:09,949 --> 01:32:13,760
know and the way that we're legalizing

2338
01:32:11,479 --> 01:32:15,829
cannabis is really still with a

2339
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:18,949
prohibitionist mentality and that's how

2340
01:32:15,829 --> 01:32:20,809
they had to sell it to the conservative

2341
01:32:18,949 --> 01:32:23,779
part of our government and people that

2342
01:32:20,810 --> 01:32:25,370
still are afraid of cannabis as the

2343
01:32:23,779 --> 01:32:28,670
whole idea of how they framed

2344
01:32:25,369 --> 01:32:31,039
legalization is that we're gonna get the

2345
01:32:28,670 --> 01:32:33,560
Wold organized-crime out and we're gonna

2346
01:32:31,039 --> 01:32:35,539
restrict access to kids so it's not like

2347
01:32:33,560 --> 01:32:37,850
we're legalizing cannabis and have

2348
01:32:35,539 --> 01:32:39,380
changed our mentality around this is a

2349
01:32:37,850 --> 01:32:40,910
wonderful beautiful plan that's a

2350
01:32:39,380 --> 01:32:43,039
solution to so many of our world's

2351
01:32:40,909 --> 01:32:44,899
problems like we're not there yet hmm

2352
01:32:43,039 --> 01:32:46,729
well it's just like Forrest said with

2353
01:32:44,899 --> 01:32:48,469
locking the little girl in the foot in

2354
01:32:46,729 --> 01:32:50,779
the basement and letting her out 40

2355
01:32:48,470 --> 01:32:52,310
years later and she's pale and pasty and

2356
01:32:50,779 --> 01:32:53,449
she's a little crooked and that's like

2357
01:32:52,310 --> 01:32:56,000
that's what we're trying to legalize

2358
01:32:53,449 --> 01:32:57,229
right now I kind of saw your vision

2359
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:59,840
there for us when you said if

2360
01:32:57,229 --> 01:33:01,759
prohibition had never happened and would

2361
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:03,500
never set this up the way we're setting

2362
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:05,630
it up and thank God for people like

2363
01:33:03,500 --> 01:33:07,579
yourself and people like Hillary or who

2364
01:33:05,630 --> 01:33:09,050
are sort of on the front lines you

2365
01:33:07,579 --> 01:33:10,340
really have to go to these Senate

2366
01:33:09,050 --> 01:33:12,140
hearings you really have to go to these

2367
01:33:10,340 --> 01:33:13,880
lawmakers and these politicians I know

2368
01:33:12,140 --> 01:33:16,250
it has been doing it for a long long

2369
01:33:13,880 --> 01:33:18,199
time as well and it's just it's

2370
01:33:16,250 --> 01:33:19,970
important work that you know not

2371
01:33:18,199 --> 01:33:21,829
everyone wants to do but the people that

2372
01:33:19,970 --> 01:33:24,560
are doing it that's because you got a

2373
01:33:21,829 --> 01:33:28,010
suit up you got a suit up and that's no

2374
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:30,170
joke right there you got a suit when it

2375
01:33:28,010 --> 01:33:31,940
goes back to where we were

2376
01:33:30,170 --> 01:33:33,560
about cultural change and the impact

2377
01:33:31,939 --> 01:33:36,559
that has on the laws we want to see

2378
01:33:33,560 --> 01:33:39,710
reflected you know Sam those grooves

2379
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:41,000
propaganda awful organizations it's just

2380
01:33:39,710 --> 01:33:42,948
spread probably some of the worst

2381
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:44,719
disinformation I've seen here in the

2382
01:33:42,948 --> 01:33:47,210
United States I did a panel on teen and

2383
01:33:44,719 --> 01:33:48,948
drug use and you know all the

2384
01:33:47,210 --> 01:33:50,659
information that the schools brought for

2385
01:33:48,948 --> 01:33:53,269
the drug education they're giving our

2386
01:33:50,659 --> 01:33:56,630
kids came from Sam and it was all wrong

2387
01:33:53,270 --> 01:33:58,460
easy was there was untrue you know if

2388
01:33:56,630 --> 01:34:00,050
you if you look at that if you want to

2389
01:33:58,460 --> 01:34:02,929
like super nerd out and look at the

2390
01:34:00,050 --> 01:34:06,619
panel that was uh in the afternoon on

2391
01:34:02,929 --> 01:34:08,119
the 23rd a dear friend of mine Rosie

2392
01:34:06,619 --> 01:34:09,920
monden has been doing some amazing

2393
01:34:08,119 --> 01:34:12,679
government relations on behalf of all of

2394
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:14,750
us she spoke and she just gutted Sam's

2395
01:34:12,679 --> 01:34:17,630
credibility to the Senate like she just

2396
01:34:14,750 --> 01:34:19,520
fully tackled it she had also organized

2397
01:34:17,630 --> 01:34:21,319
to have like thirty of the country's

2398
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:23,510
leading researchers to work together to

2399
01:34:21,319 --> 01:34:26,599
organize a rebuttal document to their

2400
01:34:23,510 --> 01:34:28,520
document but she fully gutted them and

2401
01:34:26,600 --> 01:34:30,650
then the next day they put out a press

2402
01:34:28,520 --> 01:34:32,030
release I wish I had it to put the link

2403
01:34:30,649 --> 01:34:34,579
out that he put out a press release

2404
01:34:32,029 --> 01:34:38,750
about like Losey monden slandering them

2405
01:34:34,579 --> 01:34:40,850
and they've she she produces extraction

2406
01:34:38,750 --> 01:34:42,469
equipment and they put a picture of her

2407
01:34:40,850 --> 01:34:44,539
extraction machine with this big red

2408
01:34:42,469 --> 01:34:46,250
arrow to these gummy bears and was like

2409
01:34:44,539 --> 01:34:48,619
this woman's personally responsible for

2410
01:34:46,250 --> 01:34:51,198
trying to get your kids high in a press

2411
01:34:48,619 --> 01:34:55,210
release it was like it was so it's just

2412
01:34:51,198 --> 01:34:58,399
high drama taking on Rose any luck Sam

2413
01:34:55,210 --> 01:35:00,770
before I do I just want to say one quick

2414
01:34:58,399 --> 01:35:03,379
thing to that beautiful angel of the

2415
01:35:00,770 --> 01:35:10,160
woman Kelly sitting there who has been

2416
01:35:03,380 --> 01:35:12,560
sent Kelly has been sending me medicine

2417
01:35:10,159 --> 01:35:14,929

2418
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:17,300
and is really sore and the medicine

2419
01:35:14,929 --> 01:35:19,310
Micheli is sending for my Ringo is like

2420
01:35:17,300 --> 01:35:22,429
transforming our life and letting me

2421
01:35:19,310 --> 01:35:25,370
have some quality time with him towards

2422
01:35:22,429 --> 01:35:27,289
the end and I just nobody's ever really

2423
01:35:25,369 --> 01:35:30,109
I've never really needed anybody to step

2424
01:35:27,289 --> 01:35:32,659
up for me or somebody in my family the

2425
01:35:30,109 --> 01:35:35,659
way that I do for Ringo right now and

2426
01:35:32,659 --> 01:35:37,670
those treats that you make we need to

2427
01:35:35,659 --> 01:35:38,340
get them to all of the canine nation

2428
01:35:37,670 --> 01:35:40,139
everywhere

2429
01:35:38,340 --> 01:35:46,770
the world they're like such potent

2430
01:35:40,139 --> 01:35:49,770
medicine so thank you it is absolutely

2431
01:35:46,770 --> 01:35:52,230
my honor because I feel like you just

2432
01:35:49,770 --> 01:35:55,710
touched on really the reason why we're

2433
01:35:52,229 --> 01:35:58,138
all here this plant has incredible

2434
01:35:55,710 --> 01:35:59,698
healing powers and not only does it have

2435
01:35:58,139 --> 01:36:03,000
incredible healing powers but it

2436
01:35:59,698 --> 01:36:05,399
connects us and it connects us in very

2437
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:06,960
deep ways and no matter how much

2438
01:36:05,399 --> 01:36:10,138
politics that we talk about or

2439
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:12,569
pesticides there's some kind of a love

2440
01:36:10,139 --> 01:36:14,460
flow that goes through this plant and

2441
01:36:12,569 --> 01:36:16,170
connects us all and everybody who's

2442
01:36:14,460 --> 01:36:18,270
watching this show and everybody who's

2443
01:36:16,170 --> 01:36:20,250
that connected to this plant and we all

2444
01:36:18,270 --> 01:36:21,719
hold such an important you know part of

2445
01:36:20,250 --> 01:36:24,029
this puzzle and we just want to give you

2446
01:36:21,719 --> 01:36:26,368

2447

matter what kind of gardening we we

2454
01:36:38,760 --> 01:36:41,909

01:36:57,029 --> 01:37:00,868
being a leader and showing everybody how

2462
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:03,360
it's done because it's people like you

2463
01:37:00,868 --> 01:37:06,420
that you know have guided people like me

2464
01:37:03,359 --> 01:37:08,309
and others along the way that have made

2465
01:37:06,420 --> 01:37:11,399
us realize that it is eternal vigilance

2466
01:37:08,310 --> 01:37:13,170
and that it is you can't just do it this

2467
01:37:11,399 --> 01:37:16,198
weekend and walk away from it it is a

2468
01:37:13,170 --> 01:37:18,420
constant eternal vigilance and thank you

2469
01:37:16,198 --> 01:37:20,098

thank you thanks for sharing

2472
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:34,020
thanks for crying where she destroys Sam

2473
01:37:32,550 --> 01:37:37,320
I'll get her to send you the link

2474
01:37:34,020 --> 01:37:39,929
absolutely yeah it's one of the Senate's

2475
01:37:37,319 --> 01:37:42,630
and it's all definitely yeah Rosie's

2476
01:37:39,929 --> 01:37:44,489
pretty awesome I would I want to watch

2477
01:37:42,630 --> 01:37:47,310
that as well I I was hanging out with

2478
01:37:44,488 --> 01:37:51,509
her a little bit yesterday and she's

2479
01:37:47,310 --> 01:37:53,340
just got a real lively fiery passion for

2480
01:37:51,510 --> 01:37:54,960
cannabis as well like I said earlier a

2481
01:37:53,340 --> 01:37:57,239
lot of the people that I met yesterday

2482
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:58,880
you know there are a lot of people who

2483
01:37:57,238 --> 01:38:00,988
are passionate about cannabis and it's

2484
01:37:58,880 --> 01:38:02,760
it's good to see and it's good to be a

2485
01:38:00,988 --> 01:38:04,828
part of it it's sometimes I think we get

2486
01:38:02,760 --> 01:38:06,119
lost because we've been fighting for so

2487
01:38:04,828 --> 01:38:07,439
long for this that you know for the

2488
01:38:06,118 --> 01:38:09,268
longest time we were literally being

2489
01:38:07,439 --> 01:38:11,638
jailed in prison having our lives

2490
01:38:09,269 --> 01:38:12,719
destroyed and you know we fought and

2491
01:38:11,639 --> 01:38:14,309
fought and fought and fought and

2492
01:38:12,719 --> 01:38:15,658
although that's still happening in some

2493
01:38:14,309 --> 01:38:18,029
states in a lot of different countries

2494
01:38:15,658 --> 01:38:20,129
and the fight is nowhere near over it's

2495
01:38:18,029 --> 01:38:22,259
over for so many of us who now have

2496
01:38:20,130 --> 01:38:24,359
federal exemptions and who have

2497
01:38:22,260 --> 01:38:27,090
legalization around the corner and huge

2498
01:38:24,359 --> 01:38:28,859
things in California and as it happens

2499
01:38:27,090 --> 01:38:31,889
you know obviously we get comfortable

2500
01:38:28,859 --> 01:38:34,649
with and and quickly forget about that

2501
01:38:31,889 --> 01:38:36,569
even happening and start bitching about

2502
01:38:34,649 --> 01:38:37,979
the next thing on the top of the list

2503
01:38:36,569 --> 01:38:39,538
and I just want everyone to remember

2504
01:38:37,979 --> 01:38:42,928
that the next thing on the top of the

2505
01:38:39,538 --> 01:38:45,238
list is way way way down the list from

2506
01:38:42,929 --> 01:38:47,368
being imprisoned and having our children

2507
01:38:45,238 --> 01:38:49,828
take away from us to me the next most

2508
01:38:47,368 --> 01:38:52,529
important thing on the list is is the

2509
01:38:49,828 --> 01:38:54,569
work that that Forrest and Hillary and

2510
01:38:52,529 --> 01:38:56,429
that Jan all these people are doing in

2511
01:38:54,569 --> 01:38:58,649
regards to the politics to really like

2512
01:38:56,429 --> 01:39:00,359
Hillary was not joking when she said

2513
01:38:58,649 --> 01:39:01,799
these guys are in kindergarten when it

2514
01:39:00,359 --> 01:39:03,868
comes to their cannabis knowledge so you

2515
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:05,730
can't really be harsh and judgmental

2516
01:39:03,868 --> 01:39:08,130
they're just ignorant it just needed

2517
01:39:05,729 --> 01:39:10,488
education and this is what we need to do

2518
01:39:08,130 --> 01:39:12,599
and I was actually this is a fun one

2519
01:39:10,488 --> 01:39:14,669
going to what Forrest was saying I had

2520
01:39:12,599 --> 01:39:16,110
actually have school administrators for

2521
01:39:14,670 --> 01:39:17,908
high schools and middle schools reached

2522
01:39:16,109 --> 01:39:20,038
out to me and I'm actually gonna give

2523
01:39:17,908 --> 01:39:22,109
private seminars on Saturdays and

2524
01:39:20,038 --> 01:39:24,210
educate these people on cannabis because

2525
01:39:22,109 --> 01:39:26,098
they all they have is the knowledge from

2526
01:39:24,210 --> 01:39:27,779
Sam and all these other places and

2527
01:39:26,099 --> 01:39:30,119
they're like that doesn't work this is

2528
01:39:27,779 --> 01:39:31,768
not real we need to talk to the experts

2529
01:39:30,118 --> 01:39:33,439
so they actually reached out to me and

2530
01:39:31,769 --> 01:39:37,019
I'm actually in a couple weeks gonna

2531
01:39:33,439 --> 01:39:38,879
along with my HR director take education

2532
01:39:37,019 --> 01:39:40,559
and research and show these people

2533
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:43,409
because as you said they are all

2534
01:39:40,559 --> 01:39:46,769
neophytes they are literally at ground

2535
01:39:43,408 --> 01:39:48,689
zero of no knowledge so I'm gonna start

2536
01:39:46,769 --> 01:39:52,559
with these teachers and administrators

2537
01:39:48,689 --> 01:39:54,839
on my day off and educate them so that

2538
01:39:52,559 --> 01:39:57,599
they can go back and then teach their

2539
01:39:54,840 --> 01:39:59,429
other teachers and then in the health

2540
01:39:57,599 --> 01:40:01,920
schools in next year they're going to be

2541
01:39:59,429 --> 01:40:03,690
teaching them what's really out there

2542
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:05,480
for them for Canada's because they have

2543
01:40:03,689 --> 01:40:09,349
no knowledge the state of California

2544
01:40:05,479 --> 01:40:11,509
no bit of understanding about what these

2545
01:40:09,350 --> 01:40:13,220
kids should be taught besides all that

2546
01:40:11,510 --> 01:40:16,220
lies and misinformation that's out there

2547
01:40:13,220 --> 01:40:17,690
so again shows you that you know we have

2548
01:40:16,220 --> 01:40:19,640
to take upon our shoulders to do it

2549
01:40:17,689 --> 01:40:21,439
ourselves to actually educate these

2550
01:40:19,640 --> 01:40:23,660
people so I'm gonna educate your

2551
01:40:21,439 --> 01:40:25,759
teachers so that they can throw out this

2552
01:40:23,659 --> 01:40:27,559
Dare information and then you know it

2553
01:40:25,760 --> 01:40:29,030
just shows me that there's somebody

2554
01:40:27,560 --> 01:40:30,860
needs to start a business just to

2555
01:40:29,029 --> 01:40:33,229
educate these people so that they can

2556
01:40:30,859 --> 01:40:36,170
just go around and say hey this is

2557
01:40:33,229 --> 01:40:38,119
cannabis B this is medical camera just

2558
01:40:36,170 --> 01:40:40,340
start off with the simples because it's

2559
01:40:38,119 --> 01:40:42,579
as you know as you've seen when you go

2560
01:40:40,340 --> 01:40:44,989
to Sacramento you start talking cannabis

2561
01:40:42,579 --> 01:40:47,750
you say and you just can see their eyes

2562
01:40:44,989 --> 01:40:48,829
just glaze up so we literally have to

2563
01:40:47,750 --> 01:40:50,840
start at the beginning

2564
01:40:48,829 --> 01:40:52,399
yeah well that's great news at ten'

2565
01:40:50,840 --> 01:40:53,810
starting with the children and the

2566
01:40:52,399 --> 01:40:56,239
teachers and getting that information

2567
01:40:53,810 --> 01:40:58,220
out you know probably people don't

2568
01:40:56,239 --> 01:41:00,590
realize how much of the propaganda in

2569
01:40:58,220 --> 01:41:02,449
you know negative cannabis how much of

2570
01:41:00,590 --> 01:41:04,369
it really was promoted obviously through

2571
01:41:02,449 --> 01:41:05,929
the prohibition and the and the policing

2572
01:41:04,369 --> 01:41:08,000
that was a big part because that's very

2573
01:41:05,930 --> 01:41:10,010
scary having your door kicked in but the

2574
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:12,710
next ones on the list in my opinion were

2575
01:41:10,010 --> 01:41:15,980
Hollywood constantly making derogatory

2576
01:41:12,710 --> 01:41:17,569
jokes in movies and TV and of course the

2577
01:41:15,979 --> 01:41:20,539
The Miseducation and the misinformation

2578
01:41:17,569 --> 01:41:23,539
of our children at schools with programs

2579
01:41:20,539 --> 01:41:26,029
like pride and dare and Sam these are

2580
01:41:23,539 --> 01:41:28,310
these are these are just straightforward

2581
01:41:26,029 --> 01:41:30,920
misinformation and when you're just you

2582
01:41:28,310 --> 01:41:32,990
know trying to teach children on one

2583
01:41:30,920 --> 01:41:34,909
side about certain truths and you're

2584
01:41:32,989 --> 01:41:36,969
just filling it in with lies about other

2585
01:41:34,909 --> 01:41:39,289
things this does nothing but confuse

2586
01:41:36,970 --> 01:41:41,869
confuse children and of course it's the

2587
01:41:39,289 --> 01:41:44,329
it's the birth of brainwashing well not

2588
01:41:41,869 --> 01:41:45,979
only confuse them but it's it's harmful

2589
01:41:44,329 --> 01:41:48,739
you know I think one of the biggest

2590
01:41:45,979 --> 01:41:51,529
impacts is that the schools these dare

2591
01:41:48,739 --> 01:41:54,439
programs these Sam programs are doing

2592
01:41:51,529 --> 01:41:57,279
what they're blaming cannabis for which

2593
01:41:54,439 --> 01:41:59,359
is typically this this false gateway

2594
01:41:57,279 --> 01:42:02,779
analogy where cannabis will become a

2595
01:41:59,359 --> 01:42:04,250
gateway drug but I believe that a lot of

2596
01:42:02,779 --> 01:42:06,199
these programs are what really

2597
01:42:04,250 --> 01:42:08,180
contributes to that misconception

2598
01:42:06,199 --> 01:42:10,039
because they teach kids from a very

2599
01:42:08,180 --> 01:42:12,500
young age that there's no difference

2600
01:42:10,039 --> 01:42:14,180
between heroin and cannabis and that

2601
01:42:12,500 --> 01:42:16,960
there's no difference between cocaine

2602
01:42:14,180 --> 01:42:18,960
and cannabis and meth and cannabis in

2603
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:21,569
alcohol and can

2604
01:42:18,960 --> 01:42:23,640
so what happens you know kids grow up

2605
01:42:21,569 --> 01:42:25,529
they get in high school typically with a

2606
01:42:23,640 --> 01:42:27,210
experiment with what might be around

2607
01:42:25,529 --> 01:42:29,130
first you know a lot of times that is

2608
01:42:27,210 --> 01:42:31,109
cannabis and when you teach kids that

2609
01:42:29,130 --> 01:42:34,069
there's no difference between cannabis

2610
01:42:31,109 --> 01:42:34,069
and meth in

2611
01:42:35,159 --> 01:42:40,059
what they taught was a lie it puts the

2612
01:42:38,710 --> 01:42:42,670
door to believe that there was a lie

2613
01:42:40,060 --> 01:42:44,650
with these other drugs and I absolutely

2614
01:42:42,670 --> 01:42:46,359
believe it contributes to the abuse of

2615
01:42:44,649 --> 01:42:48,309
some of these other drugs through the

2616
01:42:46,359 --> 01:42:50,289
misinformation education so it's not a

2617
01:42:48,310 --> 01:42:52,150
victimless crime and it's really sad to

2618
01:42:50,289 --> 01:42:55,029
see some of the most conservative we

2619
01:42:52,149 --> 01:42:57,519
want to help the kids folks buy into a

2620
01:42:55,029 --> 01:42:59,829
treatment plan that actually teaches

2621
01:42:57,520 --> 01:43:01,750
kids to not believe what they've been

2622
01:42:59,829 --> 01:43:03,939
taught down the road about dangerous

2623
01:43:01,750 --> 01:43:06,779
drugs and opens the door to make it

2624
01:43:03,939 --> 01:43:09,489
easier for them to experiment with them

2625
01:43:06,779 --> 01:43:10,809
it's kind of been in California culture

2626
01:43:09,489 --> 01:43:12,939
for a while so it's a little bit

2627
01:43:10,810 --> 01:43:15,130
different story here when we go like I

2628
01:43:12,939 --> 01:43:18,129
was just in Massachusetts at a town hall

2629
01:43:15,130 --> 01:43:19,840
meeting for somebody petitioning for a

2630
01:43:18,130 --> 01:43:21,789
license and a lot of people there could

2631
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:24,340
barely wrap their heads around medical

2632
01:43:21,789 --> 01:43:25,359
or just wrap their heads around medical

2633
01:43:24,340 --> 01:43:27,369
and then you have to throw the

2634
01:43:25,359 --> 01:43:30,779
recreational in now it's like a whole

2635
01:43:27,369 --> 01:43:33,369
different aspect to everybody like

2636
01:43:30,779 --> 01:43:35,529
medical was fine for a minute for most

2637
01:43:33,369 --> 01:43:38,229
people and then recreational I was super

2638
01:43:35,529 --> 01:43:40,719
surprised to hear how many people that

2639
01:43:38,229 --> 01:43:43,000
were you know for medical out there but

2640
01:43:40,720 --> 01:43:46,090
totally against recreational and it was

2641
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:48,100
like reefer madness on the same plant

2642
01:43:46,090 --> 01:43:50,350
are the same thing I'm like what are we

2643
01:43:48,100 --> 01:43:52,210
talking about here I'm like you know

2644
01:43:50,350 --> 01:43:54,190
what's recreational on Saturday is

2645
01:43:52,210 --> 01:43:55,989
medical on Monday I don't know if that's

2646
01:43:54,189 --> 01:43:58,359
true or not but I mean it's just like

2647
01:43:55,989 --> 01:44:00,880
you know what is the difference between

2648
01:43:58,359 --> 01:44:06,539
medical and recreational besides taxes

2649
01:44:00,880 --> 01:44:08,650
and money well I mean they're nothing

2650
01:44:06,539 --> 01:44:12,430
Princeton in the application but you

2651
01:44:08,649 --> 01:44:14,529
know other than that it's all grown yeah

2652
01:44:12,430 --> 01:44:16,450
but when people want to smoke weed and

2653
01:44:14,529 --> 01:44:18,009
they go buy some flowers I mean one

2654
01:44:16,449 --> 01:44:19,869
person might say I use it for medical

2655
01:44:18,010 --> 01:44:22,239
and the guy next to him might say I use

2656
01:44:19,869 --> 01:44:23,829
this for recreational and so people are

2657
01:44:22,239 --> 01:44:25,179
torn in two different worlds now

2658
01:44:23,829 --> 01:44:27,309
especially in other states where

2659
01:44:25,180 --> 01:44:30,400
cannabis isn't a part of the culture

2660
01:44:27,310 --> 01:44:32,050
it's really this defining line of you

2661
01:44:30,399 --> 01:44:33,849
know is this medical is this

2662
01:44:32,050 --> 01:44:35,529
recreational how is it even right

2663
01:44:33,850 --> 01:44:37,600
because I just was in the dare class

2664
01:44:35,529 --> 01:44:40,269
last week or whatever like Forrest was

2665
01:44:37,600 --> 01:44:42,460
saying Sam California is kind of unique

2666
01:44:40,270 --> 01:44:44,440
into its own because of the culture but

2667
01:44:42,460 --> 01:44:47,649
these other states I've been going to

2668
01:44:44,439 --> 01:44:50,259
it's it's a serious controversy

2669
01:44:47,649 --> 01:44:52,629
on the medical versus recreational topic

2670
01:44:50,260 --> 01:44:55,210
alone and that's what was surprising to

2671
01:44:52,630 --> 01:44:57,779
me because I'm just used to being you

2672
01:44:55,210 --> 01:44:59,980
know cannabis period and everything

2673
01:44:57,779 --> 01:45:02,439
instant reefer madness but now the

2674
01:44:59,979 --> 01:45:05,589
argument for medical and recreational is

2675
01:45:02,439 --> 01:45:08,859
like even more absurd in some ways yeah

2676
01:45:05,590 --> 01:45:11,289
another way to divide yeah in the

2677
01:45:08,859 --> 01:45:13,569
beginning you know this it's a it's this

2678
01:45:11,289 --> 01:45:15,670
cultural sand that is applied to

2679
01:45:13,569 --> 01:45:17,619
recreational this comes back like this

2680
01:45:15,670 --> 01:45:19,810
whole you know it reminds me of this

2681
01:45:17,619 --> 01:45:22,210
this whole Christian you know don't

2682
01:45:19,810 --> 01:45:24,580
masturbate don't have sex don't feel

2683
01:45:22,210 --> 01:45:27,369
good anything that involves some sort of

2684
01:45:24,579 --> 01:45:30,399
pleasure the human body is inherently

2685
01:45:27,369 --> 01:45:32,619
evil and wrong so what we have here with

2686
01:45:30,399 --> 01:45:34,000
cannabis is just this inherent we don't

2687
01:45:32,619 --> 01:45:36,279
know why we believe it but it's been

2688
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:38,140
ingrained in us from day one that it's

2689
01:45:36,279 --> 01:45:40,210
bad or anything that changes your state

2690
01:45:38,140 --> 01:45:42,579
of mind is bad and evil and we have to

2691
01:45:40,210 --> 01:45:46,359
grow out of it we absolutely have to

2692
01:45:42,579 --> 01:45:48,399
stop associating using things that make

2693
01:45:46,359 --> 01:45:49,960
us feel different to relieve stress or

2694
01:45:48,399 --> 01:45:53,139
just because we want to feel different

2695
01:45:49,960 --> 01:45:55,869
as inherently bad if it's not harmful to

2696
01:45:53,140 --> 01:45:57,699
the body into the community and was that

2697
01:45:55,869 --> 01:45:59,698
a pun intended when you said we have to

2698
01:45:57,698 --> 01:46:04,359
grow out of it

2699
01:45:59,698 --> 01:46:09,488
sure yeah you know the division between

2700
01:46:04,359 --> 01:46:11,019
recreation and medical obviously someone

2701
01:46:09,488 --> 01:46:13,059
mentioned it in chat that the difference

2702
01:46:11,020 --> 01:46:14,770
I guess could be construed as intense

2703
01:46:13,060 --> 01:46:16,390
but aren't they both really also

2704
01:46:14,770 --> 01:46:18,010
preventive like when you're using

2705
01:46:16,390 --> 01:46:19,570
cannabis as a medicine and you're

2706
01:46:18,010 --> 01:46:21,520
saturating your endocannabinoid system

2707
01:46:19,569 --> 01:46:23,139
and you're regulating your biological

2708
01:46:21,520 --> 01:46:24,640
functions the way they need to be

2709
01:46:23,140 --> 01:46:25,869
isn't there a form of prevention

2710
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:28,300
involved whether you're using

2711
01:46:25,869 --> 01:46:30,399
medicinally for one specific element or

2712
01:46:28,300 --> 01:46:32,980
you're using recreationally to feel a

2713
01:46:30,399 --> 01:46:35,139
certain way I think that there's also a

2714
01:46:32,979 --> 01:46:37,059
preventive aspect to it and really I'm

2715
01:46:35,140 --> 01:46:38,800
not sure that we should be too worried I

2716
01:46:37,060 --> 01:46:41,350
mean that the real division to me

2717
01:46:38,800 --> 01:46:43,810
between recreational and medical isn't

2718
01:46:41,350 --> 01:46:46,840
in the intention of the person but it's

2719
01:46:43,810 --> 01:46:49,000
in the quality of the product because

2720
01:46:46,840 --> 01:46:51,520
when it is people use radioactive

2721
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:53,439
tobacco as a recreational product and

2722
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:54,880
they use poisonous alcohols and all

2723
01:46:53,439 --> 01:46:56,769
sorts of different things and they're

2724
01:46:54,880 --> 01:46:58,000
adults it's called a doll use they

2725
01:46:56,770 --> 01:47:00,010
should be allowed to do what they want

2726
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:01,448
if you want to sort of endanger your own

2727
01:47:00,010 --> 01:47:03,550
health it shouldn't be anyone

2728
01:47:01,448 --> 01:47:05,799
issue but when your health is already

2729
01:47:03,550 --> 01:47:08,350
endangered when you have some serious

2730
01:47:05,800 --> 01:47:10,179
element you need to be knowing that the

2731
01:47:08,350 --> 01:47:12,550
myth the medicine that you're purchasing

2732
01:47:10,179 --> 01:47:15,190
is being produced on a level that may be

2733
01:47:12,550 --> 01:47:17,590
too the you know beyond and above what

2734
01:47:15,189 --> 01:47:21,279
what could be you know sold as as

2735
01:47:17,590 --> 01:47:22,869
recreational product so there needs to

2736
01:47:21,279 --> 01:47:25,179
be some distinction I mean just because

2737
01:47:22,869 --> 01:47:27,640
dosage limits alone make it a challenge

2738
01:47:25,179 --> 01:47:29,440
you know when we blur medicinal and

2739
01:47:27,640 --> 01:47:32,050
recreational uses and it is you know

2740
01:47:29,439 --> 01:47:33,789
Howard how we're using it I mean we were

2741
01:47:32,050 --> 01:47:36,520
working with the BCC in California we

2742
01:47:33,789 --> 01:47:38,920
actually got them to raise the limit up

2743
01:47:36,520 --> 01:47:41,020
to ten thousand milligrams but you know

2744
01:47:38,920 --> 01:47:42,850
when we have for example this perception

2745
01:47:41,020 --> 01:47:44,320
of recreational use or someone just

2746
01:47:42,850 --> 01:47:46,929
wants to change their state of mind as

2747
01:47:44,319 --> 01:47:48,789
opposed to treating you know a tumour

2748
01:47:46,929 --> 01:47:51,369
issue or an endocannabinoid deficiency

2749
01:47:48,789 --> 01:47:53,829
disorder you know we have what is it in

2750
01:47:51,369 --> 01:47:55,689
California eighteen five milligram doses

2751
01:47:53,829 --> 01:48:01,090
per serving is that what it is right now

2752
01:47:55,689 --> 01:48:02,979
I think there is a 10 it's 10 100 it's

2753
01:48:01,090 --> 01:48:05,079
100 maximum in a packaging so most

2754
01:48:02,979 --> 01:48:09,369
people are doing 10 or you're seeing

2755
01:48:05,079 --> 01:48:12,760
people also do those micro dosing pass

2756
01:48:09,369 --> 01:48:15,369
tools or you know things like that micro

2757
01:48:12,760 --> 01:48:17,260
definitely conditions that need six

2758
01:48:15,369 --> 01:48:19,269
seven eight hundred thirteen hundred

2759
01:48:17,260 --> 01:48:21,659
milligram a day dosing and they're

2760
01:48:19,270 --> 01:48:24,100
restricted through sort of that

2761
01:48:21,659 --> 01:48:26,260
intention right the intention of how

2762
01:48:24,100 --> 01:48:27,340
it's supposed to be used then you put

2763
01:48:26,260 --> 01:48:29,409
patients in a really tough position

2764
01:48:27,340 --> 01:48:31,750
there's a you can't really get a lot of

2765
01:48:29,409 --> 01:48:33,880
therapeutically dosed products still in

2766
01:48:31,750 --> 01:48:35,920
dispensaries because of some of these

2767
01:48:33,880 --> 01:48:37,420
restrictions so again I agree with

2768
01:48:35,920 --> 01:48:39,310
everything you say Marcus but we at the

2769
01:48:37,420 --> 01:48:41,230
same time have to be able to maybe draw

2770
01:48:39,310 --> 01:48:43,210
some in the legislature draw some sort

2771
01:48:41,229 --> 01:48:45,069
of distinction on how it's used and

2772
01:48:43,210 --> 01:48:47,109
intended to be used so that those

2773
01:48:45,069 --> 01:48:51,759
products can be available for patients

2774
01:48:47,109 --> 01:48:54,369
at needle preparation we strip the

2775
01:48:51,760 --> 01:48:57,250
recreational strip the medical abilities

2776
01:48:54,369 --> 01:48:59,859
in California quite a bit I mean I can't

2777
01:48:57,250 --> 01:49:02,170
believe that access people do not have

2778
01:48:59,859 --> 01:49:04,059
anymore and the expense people are

2779
01:49:02,170 --> 01:49:06,279
paying to try to get the same medicine

2780
01:49:04,060 --> 01:49:08,260
like I was at the height I decided to

2781
01:49:06,279 --> 01:49:10,210
give the Sacramento High Times cup kind

2782
01:49:08,260 --> 01:49:13,600
of cuz it was the first legal whatever

2783
01:49:10,210 --> 01:49:15,300
and I'm not that far away and so I went

2784
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:16,679
down and really popular

2785
01:49:15,300 --> 01:49:19,139
means that I could buy at a farmers

2786
01:49:16,679 --> 01:49:20,940
market last summer and up north or

2787
01:49:19,139 --> 01:49:23,099
whatever you know we're a hundred

2788
01:49:20,939 --> 01:49:26,098
milligram box each gummy was ten

2789
01:49:23,099 --> 01:49:29,039
milligrams and it was $25 plus all the

2790
01:49:26,099 --> 01:49:31,800
tax so I mean I can't imagine somebody

2791
01:49:29,039 --> 01:49:33,689
that have to rely on seven or eight

2792
01:49:31,800 --> 01:49:36,119
hundred milligrams a day and have to go

2793
01:49:33,689 --> 01:49:38,609
buy it legally now I mean it would

2794
01:49:36,118 --> 01:49:40,198
bankrupt them I mean I'm hearing that

2795
01:49:38,609 --> 01:49:41,939
from other people but I guess I just

2796
01:49:40,198 --> 01:49:44,789
didn't realize it for myself till I did

2797
01:49:41,939 --> 01:49:47,069
a little shopping around ya know go buy

2798
01:49:44,789 --> 01:49:49,948
some flowers and the Jarrah flowers is

2799
01:49:47,069 --> 01:49:52,558
like this tax that tax and you know here

2800
01:49:49,948 --> 01:49:59,428
I was like wow this is fun for a second

2801
01:49:52,559 --> 01:50:01,739
but really crazy and how can we separate

2802
01:49:59,429 --> 01:50:03,328
you know the idea of recreational from

2803
01:50:01,738 --> 01:50:05,578
medical at all what was that like the

2804
01:50:03,328 --> 01:50:07,590
Industrial Revolution like nine-to-five

2805
01:50:05,578 --> 01:50:09,149
that all of a sudden said that there's

2806
01:50:07,590 --> 01:50:10,739
some kind of difference between our

2807
01:50:09,149 --> 01:50:16,589
well-being and our health and the way

2808
01:50:10,738 --> 01:50:18,689
that we recreation typically that you

2809
01:50:16,590 --> 01:50:21,449
know to be happy boosts your immune

2810
01:50:18,689 --> 01:50:23,039
system so if we're recreative like you

2811
01:50:21,448 --> 01:50:25,710
were saying earlier marcus that's only

2812
01:50:23,039 --> 01:50:27,569
prevention for the diseases that come

2813
01:50:25,710 --> 01:50:30,118
down the line for you know getting

2814
01:50:27,569 --> 01:50:31,920
tumors and everything being happy is the

2815
01:50:30,118 --> 01:50:33,509
most important thing that we can do and

2816
01:50:31,920 --> 01:50:36,210
if that means you know token on your

2817
01:50:33,510 --> 01:50:38,760
cannabis or eating your gummies for a

2818
01:50:36,210 --> 01:50:40,559
good price and and it's a healthy way of

2819
01:50:38,760 --> 01:50:42,780
living then that's just only gonna make

2820
01:50:40,559 --> 01:50:44,730
sense for i just don't see the

2821
01:50:42,779 --> 01:50:46,408
separation in any way shape or form I

2822
01:50:44,729 --> 01:50:49,379
feel like it's just a lot of political

2823
01:50:46,408 --> 01:50:51,328
rhetoric and taxes that just put it on

2824
01:50:49,380 --> 01:50:53,219
there I find it really interesting that

2825
01:50:51,328 --> 01:50:54,960
you know in the 1800s and all the

2826
01:50:53,219 --> 01:50:57,300
apothecaries of the world you know as

2827
01:50:54,960 --> 01:50:59,880
you stated before cannabis was the you

2828
01:50:57,300 --> 01:51:02,730
know main ingredient and all of what we

2829
01:50:59,880 --> 01:51:03,179
used from the apothecary that we went

2830
01:51:02,729 --> 01:51:05,428
for it

2831
01:51:03,179 --> 01:51:07,139
you know healing and then you know here

2832
01:51:05,429 --> 01:51:09,118
came the the prohibition and the

2833
01:51:07,139 --> 01:51:11,159
Anslinger and all the stuff that came in

2834
01:51:09,118 --> 01:51:12,988
the monkeys and now all the sudden we're

2835
01:51:11,158 --> 01:51:14,969
getting read brainwashed into being like

2836
01:51:12,988 --> 01:51:17,578
oh this is like this is a drug and then

2837
01:51:14,969 --> 01:51:18,960
and then here it comes to 1996 and

2838
01:51:17,578 --> 01:51:21,808
they're like actually it's a medicine

2839
01:51:18,960 --> 01:51:24,960
and then so we have all this opening up

2840
01:51:21,809 --> 01:51:26,039
of mindsets because it's medical and we

2841
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:28,230
all

2842
01:51:26,039 --> 01:51:30,750
and you know as a culture we get excited

2843
01:51:28,229 --> 01:51:32,069
because oh my god this is the best news

2844
01:51:30,750 --> 01:51:33,989
in the world you know everything that we

2845
01:51:32,069 --> 01:51:35,729
were working for its medically good for

2846
01:51:33,989 --> 01:51:38,159
us and we all these studies come out and

2847
01:51:35,729 --> 01:51:40,769
then this big dark cloud of legalization

2848
01:51:38,159 --> 01:51:42,539
comes and recreational and then all of a

2849
01:51:40,770 --> 01:51:45,270
sudden it's like forget about the whole

2850
01:51:42,539 --> 01:51:48,899
medical thing this is a taxable item

2851
01:51:45,270 --> 01:51:51,450
we're in debt let's go go corporations

2852
01:51:48,899 --> 01:51:53,639
let's sell taxes let's sell shares and

2853
01:51:51,449 --> 01:51:55,409
it just feels like it insults to our

2854
01:51:53,640 --> 01:51:56,610
intelligence so that's what I have to

2855
01:51:55,409 --> 01:51:58,590
say about that and still have

2856
01:51:56,609 --> 01:52:00,000
differential testing rights like like I

2857
01:51:58,590 --> 01:52:03,239
thought I remember like in Washington

2858
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:05,399
state they had testing regs for the

2859
01:52:03,239 --> 01:52:06,929
recreational market in none for the

2860
01:52:05,399 --> 01:52:08,729
medical market so the medical market

2861
01:52:06,930 --> 01:52:10,710
became the dumping ground for all the

2862
01:52:08,729 --> 01:52:12,149
stuff that failed the REC market does

2863
01:52:10,710 --> 01:52:15,210
that still go in honor today because

2864
01:52:12,149 --> 01:52:16,889
they finally like right that chip not in

2865
01:52:15,210 --> 01:52:22,170
college no big job and ethically

2866
01:52:16,890 --> 01:52:24,090
problematic completely yeah and that's

2867
01:52:22,170 --> 01:52:25,500
something we're all recreational yeah

2868
01:52:24,090 --> 01:52:27,150
we're really fighting that here in

2869
01:52:25,500 --> 01:52:29,369
California because you know

2870
01:52:27,149 --> 01:52:31,019
so the colliders network is a children's

2871
01:52:29,369 --> 01:52:32,699
agency for those who don't know we deal

2872
01:52:31,020 --> 01:52:35,900
with Pediatrics terminally and

2873
01:52:32,699 --> 01:52:35,899
catastrophic lis if though

2874
01:52:37,130 --> 01:52:39,190
you

2875
01:52:39,779 --> 01:52:45,009
[Music]

2876
01:52:42,479 --> 01:52:47,469
right where they don't have a lot of

2877
01:52:45,010 --> 01:52:50,530
progressive loss and it's because of the

2878
01:52:47,470 --> 01:52:53,980
merging of the adult use recreational

2879
01:52:50,529 --> 01:52:56,349
medical markets there is a big

2880
01:52:53,979 --> 01:53:00,909
difference between CBD gummies and what

2881
01:52:56,350 --> 01:53:04,390
is necessary for treating rare difficult

2882
01:53:00,909 --> 01:53:06,130
neurological conditions and what the

2883
01:53:04,390 --> 01:53:08,289
problem is is you're right we could just

2884
01:53:06,130 --> 01:53:10,869
say that if we're saying cannabis is

2885
01:53:08,289 --> 01:53:12,250
free and we can do what we want with it

2886
01:53:10,869 --> 01:53:14,380
well then there's no problem but

2887
01:53:12,250 --> 01:53:16,569
unfortunately we have the limits that

2888
01:53:14,380 --> 01:53:18,880
are being imposed or from a recreational

2889
01:53:16,569 --> 01:53:20,590
point of view and there are limits

2890
01:53:18,880 --> 01:53:22,810
because people aren't using cannabis

2891
01:53:20,590 --> 01:53:25,300
responsibly you know and this is where I

2892
01:53:22,810 --> 01:53:27,430
push back a little bit on the all use

2893
01:53:25,300 --> 01:53:29,949
this medicinal use because you know you

2894
01:53:27,430 --> 01:53:32,200
can go on YouTube in Google you know

2895
01:53:29,949 --> 01:53:35,319
college kids first dab in some of these

2896
01:53:32,199 --> 01:53:38,500
videos where you see kids completely

2897
01:53:35,319 --> 01:53:40,750
cannabis naive taking huge dabs that

2898
01:53:38,500 --> 01:53:43,810
cause paralysis in one kid and the

2899
01:53:40,750 --> 01:53:46,270
videos online he goes into a full panic

2900
01:53:43,810 --> 01:53:48,100
attack he's freaking out you know that's

2901
01:53:46,270 --> 01:53:50,470
not beneficial that can actually be

2902
01:53:48,100 --> 01:53:54,550
damaging for folks and that fear of that

2903
01:53:50,470 --> 01:53:56,980
happening you know is putting laws in

2904
01:53:54,550 --> 01:53:58,690
place that make medicinal not the

2905
01:53:56,979 --> 01:54:02,349
medicinal means for therapeutic levels

2906
01:53:58,689 --> 01:54:03,750
really difficult to to achieve so I you

2907
01:54:02,350 --> 01:54:06,760
know I agree but it's a complex

2908
01:54:03,750 --> 01:54:09,100
conversation that whatever is decided to

2909
01:54:06,760 --> 01:54:11,170
be done if we have to differentiate to

2910
01:54:09,100 --> 01:54:12,640
ensure access than we differentiate

2911
01:54:11,170 --> 01:54:14,319
until we get to a point where we can

2912
01:54:12,640 --> 01:54:16,480
realize the cannabis is safe and it can

2913
01:54:14,319 --> 01:54:18,489
just be open the problem is that we're

2914
01:54:16,479 --> 01:54:22,449
putting limits on medicinal cannabis to

2915
01:54:18,489 --> 01:54:24,460
prevent people ending up in the hospital

2916
01:54:22,449 --> 01:54:26,109
because they eat too many brownies that

2917
01:54:24,460 --> 01:54:27,789
are preventing cancer patients and

2918
01:54:26,109 --> 01:54:30,339
epileptics from getting what they need

2919
01:54:27,789 --> 01:54:32,350
to survive and their life depends on it

2920
01:54:30,340 --> 01:54:35,770
and that and that is a definitely

2921
01:54:32,350 --> 01:54:39,010
medicine and necessary so it's it's a

2922
01:54:35,770 --> 01:54:40,840
tough one but I totally agree I think

2923
01:54:39,010 --> 01:54:43,539
that it's really important but but I

2924
01:54:40,840 --> 01:54:46,510
feel like you know it really is being

2925
01:54:43,539 --> 01:54:48,130
caught up in politics and rhetoric and

2926
01:54:46,510 --> 01:54:49,989
you know getting back on that kid that

2927
01:54:48,130 --> 01:54:51,819
took the dab is it really the cannabis

2928
01:54:49,989 --> 01:54:52,479
that did that or was it the pesticides

2929
01:54:51,819 --> 01:54:54,969
you know

2930
01:54:52,479 --> 01:54:57,909
cause that in that child you know that's

2931
01:54:54,970 --> 01:54:59,949
a total side side comment but I believe

2932
01:54:57,909 --> 01:55:01,720
that it is really important but when

2933
01:54:59,949 --> 01:55:04,988
we're starting to separate out a plant

2934
01:55:01,720 --> 01:55:06,940
that's just totally good for you then it

2935
01:55:04,988 --> 01:55:08,738
becomes political then it becomes money

2936
01:55:06,939 --> 01:55:10,329
and then that's where we all get messed

2937
01:55:08,738 --> 01:55:11,889
up and that's why we're having all of

2938
01:55:10,329 --> 01:55:14,260
these conversations where these people

2939
01:55:11,890 --> 01:55:15,970
have been part of the culture from the

2940
01:55:14,260 --> 01:55:17,949
very beginning bringing it forward or no

2941
01:55:15,970 --> 01:55:20,320
longer able to be part of a culture and

2942
01:55:17,949 --> 01:55:21,880
now a pharmaceutical company is taking

2943
01:55:20,319 --> 01:55:23,469
it over but the pharmaceutical company

2944
01:55:21,880 --> 01:55:25,569
isn't getting rights in access it just

2945
01:55:23,470 --> 01:55:27,550
becomes a whole muddled problem which

2946
01:55:25,569 --> 01:55:29,199
really is representative of all of the

2947
01:55:27,550 --> 01:55:31,480
politics and I don't mean to brush it

2948
01:55:29,199 --> 01:55:33,939
off on all politics but here we are

2949
01:55:31,479 --> 01:55:37,569
cannabis now has become a political

2950
01:55:33,939 --> 01:55:39,460
discussion I saw a lot of 40s and 50

2951
01:55:37,569 --> 01:55:41,769
year olds laid out on the ground at high

2952
01:55:39,460 --> 01:55:47,199
times from taking their first too big of

2953
01:55:41,770 --> 01:55:49,330
a dab or whatever it was I mean I've

2954
01:55:47,199 --> 01:55:53,849
seen it in Amsterdam people eating too

2955
01:55:49,329 --> 01:55:56,590
many edibles and just collapsing on the

2956
01:55:53,850 --> 01:55:59,020
the cobblestone and it's you know

2957
01:55:56,590 --> 01:56:01,449
sometimes violent and and sometimes

2958
01:55:59,020 --> 01:56:04,600
actually involves you know pain so I

2959
01:56:01,449 --> 01:56:06,609
always love forests perspective he has a

2960
01:56:04,600 --> 01:56:10,000
very unique perspective in all of this

2961
01:56:06,609 --> 01:56:12,639
having a very sick child and coming to

2962
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:14,770
this from-from Silas's perspective it's

2963
01:56:12,640 --> 01:56:18,130
it's not a perspective than any of us

2964
01:56:14,770 --> 01:56:21,280
could possibly have and I always find it

2965
01:56:18,130 --> 01:56:23,380
very just very important for and I love

2966
01:56:21,279 --> 01:56:25,000
his confidence and always like whether

2967
01:56:23,380 --> 01:56:26,650
it's creating a little bit of discomfort

2968
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:29,020
and just saying what he has to say

2969
01:56:26,649 --> 01:56:31,269
because it's it's very important at the

2970
01:56:29,020 --> 01:56:32,860
same time I know I know Kelly and Josh

2971
01:56:31,270 --> 01:56:35,050
and I know how you know they've got

2972
01:56:32,859 --> 01:56:38,109
these great healthy people in their

2973
01:56:35,050 --> 01:56:40,930
lives healthy son they have seen him use

2974
01:56:38,109 --> 01:56:43,029
cannabis and it's so they have this

2975
01:56:40,930 --> 01:56:44,350
other unique perspective and it's just

2976
01:56:43,029 --> 01:56:47,109
neat to see the two perspectives

2977
01:56:44,350 --> 01:56:48,789
interact and talk about this this

2978
01:56:47,109 --> 01:56:50,829
importance because on you know from one

2979
01:56:48,789 --> 01:56:52,449
perspective you can see like oh why why

2980
01:56:50,829 --> 01:56:54,309
do we need to differentiate we shouldn't

2981
01:56:52,449 --> 01:56:55,809
have to and then you can see from

2982
01:56:54,310 --> 01:56:56,950
forests perspective it's like well yeah

2983
01:56:55,810 --> 01:56:58,600
I don't want to have to differentiate

2984
01:56:56,949 --> 01:57:00,309
but if that's the way I have to do it to

2985
01:56:58,600 --> 01:57:00,579
ensure that my son and other kids like

2986
01:57:00,310 --> 01:57:04,060
him

2987
01:57:00,579 --> 01:57:05,859
get a clean medicine and access then I

2988
01:57:04,060 --> 01:57:06,380
will jump through whatever hoop I have

2989
01:57:05,859 --> 01:57:08,839
to jump

2990
01:57:06,380 --> 01:57:10,400
to make that happen and that's exactly

2991
01:57:08,840 --> 01:57:13,130
it I mean I agree with everything Kelly

2992
01:57:10,399 --> 01:57:14,988
and josh has said but it's it goes back

2993
01:57:13,130 --> 01:57:18,889
to her you know this all circles back to

2994
01:57:14,988 --> 01:57:20,689
the general lack of real education and

2995
01:57:18,889 --> 01:57:23,029
understanding and in our lawmakers

2996
01:57:20,689 --> 01:57:24,979
that's what it comes back to and what

2997
01:57:23,029 --> 01:57:27,408
happens is when when they hear there's

2998
01:57:24,979 --> 01:57:29,269
no difference then they falsely assume

2999
01:57:27,408 --> 01:57:31,369
well that dispensaries open so you have

3000
01:57:29,270 --> 01:57:32,090
all the medicine you need right and in

3001
01:57:31,369 --> 01:57:34,609
everything it's good they don't

3002
01:57:32,090 --> 01:57:36,949
understand the nuance of what needs to

3003
01:57:34,609 --> 01:57:38,359
continue to be allowed so yeah I agree

3004
01:57:36,948 --> 01:57:40,460
with everything killing Josh said but

3005
01:57:38,359 --> 01:57:42,738
again as a parent and someone who works

3006
01:57:40,460 --> 01:57:44,960
with pediatrics and children it

3007
01:57:42,738 --> 01:57:47,089
definitely is highlighted to me where

3008
01:57:44,960 --> 01:57:49,010
some of those concepts actually are

3009
01:57:47,090 --> 01:57:52,520
causing harm because of the lack of

3010
01:57:49,010 --> 01:57:54,469
understanding in our lawmakers and I

3011
01:57:52,520 --> 01:57:57,650
totally agree with you as well of course

3012
01:57:54,469 --> 01:57:59,779
it's it's such a point it's such a good

3013
01:57:57,649 --> 01:58:01,279
point and it's so important for the work

3014
01:57:59,779 --> 01:58:03,229
that's being done for the children and

3015
01:58:01,279 --> 01:58:05,809
bringing it forward and and it's become

3016
01:58:03,229 --> 01:58:08,238
so taboo you know with the idea that

3017
01:58:05,810 --> 01:58:09,920
it's only recreational then if it's only

3018
01:58:08,238 --> 01:58:12,738
recreational then we can't give it to

3019
01:58:09,920 --> 01:58:14,658
our kids and that just isn't isn't the

3020
01:58:12,738 --> 01:58:16,579
case at all so it does it becomes real

3021
01:58:14,658 --> 01:58:17,779
muddled in the in the education of it

3022
01:58:16,579 --> 01:58:20,750
and how are we gonna bring this

3023
01:58:17,779 --> 01:58:23,479
education for that includes you know all

3024
01:58:20,750 --> 01:58:25,250
forms of the medicine as well as all

3025
01:58:23,479 --> 01:58:27,709
uses of the medicine and I guess it's

3026
01:58:25,250 --> 01:58:28,760
from a grower at the end and when it's

3027
01:58:27,710 --> 01:58:30,649
all said and done it doesn't really

3028
01:58:28,760 --> 01:58:32,929
matter it really just matters was it

3029
01:58:30,649 --> 01:58:35,210
grown properly and clean because whether

3030
01:58:32,929 --> 01:58:36,469
to the recreational or the medical I

3031
01:58:35,210 --> 01:58:39,139
think we should just try and you know

3032
01:58:36,469 --> 01:58:41,689
make it you know healthy let's say yeah

3033
01:58:39,139 --> 01:58:43,369
and and 40 percent of what it is that

3034
01:58:41,689 --> 01:58:45,649
you're getting you know is coming up

3035
01:58:43,369 --> 01:58:48,019
dirty just is really representative of

3036
01:58:45,649 --> 01:58:49,759
you know what's going on in the toxins

3037
01:58:48,020 --> 01:58:53,510
of the world and that's not something

3038
01:58:49,760 --> 01:58:55,760
that is acceptable or okay in any way so

3039
01:58:53,510 --> 01:58:57,949
that's a whole other force of Education

3040
01:58:55,760 --> 01:58:59,780
that needs to come forward so here's a

3041
01:58:57,948 --> 01:59:01,299
question for the panel someone asked it

3042
01:58:59,779 --> 01:59:04,219
earlier and they were asking about

3043
01:59:01,300 --> 01:59:06,199
irradiated cannabis and how that's

3044
01:59:04,219 --> 01:59:08,149
affecting cannabis and how that might be

3045
01:59:06,198 --> 01:59:09,439
affecting patients and so this is

3046
01:59:08,149 --> 01:59:11,229
something that's happening in Canada

3047
01:59:09,439 --> 01:59:14,899
where there's a federally regulated

3048
01:59:11,229 --> 01:59:15,679
marketplace and so does anyone know much

3049
01:59:14,899 --> 01:59:19,369
on the pan

3050
01:59:15,680 --> 01:59:21,380
about irradiated cannabis I mean Arno

3051
01:59:19,369 --> 01:59:23,930
did a study on it and showed that you

3052
01:59:21,380 --> 01:59:25,760
know it it definitely takes care of the

3053
01:59:23,930 --> 01:59:29,270
molds and mildews but it definitely

3054
01:59:25,760 --> 01:59:30,800
destroys the terpenes and it doesn't

3055
01:59:29,270 --> 01:59:32,810
destroy them all but it affected the

3056
01:59:30,800 --> 01:59:34,610
terpene profile affects them

3057
01:59:32,810 --> 01:59:36,260
significantly but now we need to see

3058
01:59:34,609 --> 01:59:38,569
what is that actual difference you know

3059
01:59:36,260 --> 01:59:40,130
what you know if you actually smoked it

3060
01:59:38,569 --> 01:59:41,719
compared to the other you know can you

3061
01:59:40,130 --> 01:59:43,909
actually taste a flavor difference was

3062
01:59:41,720 --> 01:59:45,770
there an on-set difference you know that

3063
01:59:43,909 --> 01:59:47,329
needs to be studied unfortunately you

3064
01:59:45,770 --> 01:59:49,700
know just because that one study come

3065
01:59:47,329 --> 01:59:51,170
out that leads to as you know I think

3066
01:59:49,699 --> 01:59:53,859
Kevin would say more studies need to

3067
01:59:51,170 --> 01:59:56,060
take place can we explain what

3068
01:59:53,859 --> 01:59:58,399
irradiated weed will be or what the

3069
01:59:56,060 --> 02:00:00,920
process is I think that's a good point

3070
01:59:58,399 --> 02:00:03,409
to make from what and from what I

3071
02:00:00,920 --> 02:00:06,649
understand it's a bean at the lift

3072
02:00:03,409 --> 02:00:08,840
expose it's an irradiating machine that

3073
02:00:06,649 --> 02:00:11,170
has a like a conveyor belt that goes

3074
02:00:08,840 --> 02:00:14,329
through it and it brings the buds

3075
02:00:11,170 --> 02:00:16,489
through and it radiates it to like take

3076
02:00:14,329 --> 02:00:18,229
to take away the responsibility of the

3077
02:00:16,489 --> 02:00:21,199
grower you they they just basically say

3078
02:00:18,229 --> 02:00:23,149
now grow what you want we'll clean it up

3079
02:00:21,199 --> 02:00:25,970
it's kind of like the distal thing in a

3080
02:00:23,149 --> 02:00:27,799
way this isn't a UV light they're

3081
02:00:25,970 --> 02:00:30,320
pushing it through yeah well what

3082
02:00:27,800 --> 02:00:32,840
wikipedia says is it's it's the process

3083
02:00:30,319 --> 02:00:36,109
of exposing food and food packaging to

3084
02:00:32,840 --> 02:00:38,510
ionization radiation ionizing radiation

3085
02:00:36,109 --> 02:00:40,609
such from gamma rays x-rays or electron

3086
02:00:38,510 --> 02:00:42,440
beams is energy that can be transmitted

3087
02:00:40,609 --> 02:00:44,989
without direct contact to the source of

3088
02:00:42,439 --> 02:00:47,509
the energy radiation capable of freeing

3089
02:00:44,989 --> 02:00:49,909
electrons from their atomic bonds in the

3090
02:00:47,510 --> 02:00:52,130
targeted food the radiation can be

3091
02:00:49,909 --> 02:00:54,319
emitted by a radioactive substance or

3092
02:00:52,130 --> 02:00:56,060
generated electrically and this

3093
02:00:54,319 --> 02:00:57,909
treatment is used to improve food safety

3094
02:00:56,060 --> 02:01:00,320
by extending product shelf-life

3095
02:00:57,909 --> 02:01:01,970
preservation reducing the risk of

3096
02:01:00,319 --> 02:01:03,909
foodborne illnesses and delaying or

3097
02:01:01,970 --> 02:01:06,560
eliminating sprouting or ripening by

3098
02:01:03,909 --> 02:01:09,439
sterilization of foods and as a means of

3099
02:01:06,560 --> 02:01:13,100
controlling insects and invasive pests

3100
02:01:09,439 --> 02:01:14,899
that's medical well that's I just read

3101
02:01:13,100 --> 02:01:18,860
that technically it's every potato you

3102
02:01:14,899 --> 02:01:21,049
eat or is irradiated yeah lots lots of

3103
02:01:18,859 --> 02:01:22,880
foods are actually irradiated so it's

3104
02:01:21,050 --> 02:01:25,369
it's just but like once again we could

3105
02:01:22,880 --> 02:01:26,539
say that putting food in our stomachs

3106
02:01:25,369 --> 02:01:29,039
might be a little bit different than

3107
02:01:26,539 --> 02:01:31,109
inhaling molecules into our lungs

3108
02:01:29,039 --> 02:01:34,500
and if the terpene profile itself is

3109
02:01:31,109 --> 02:01:36,029
being affected then how bad is it being

3110
02:01:34,500 --> 02:01:37,460
affected if we know that terpenes

3111
02:01:36,029 --> 02:01:40,559
modulate the effects of cannabinoids

3112
02:01:37,460 --> 02:01:43,710
those are probably fairly important to

3113
02:01:40,560 --> 02:01:44,670
be left alone the way they are but yeah

3114
02:01:43,710 --> 02:01:46,470
I just thought it would be an

3115
02:01:44,670 --> 02:01:47,909
interesting conversation maybe we can

3116
02:01:46,470 --> 02:01:49,470
get someone on here in the next couple

3117
02:01:47,909 --> 02:01:51,300
of weeks that knows a little bit more

3118
02:01:49,470 --> 02:01:53,310
about it and could share with us because

3119
02:01:51,300 --> 02:01:54,900
I I I would like to know more about it

3120
02:01:53,310 --> 02:01:57,270
myself it's one thing I really don't

3121
02:01:54,899 --> 02:02:00,119
know much when someone asks me about

3122
02:01:57,270 --> 02:02:01,160
cannabis irradiation arno would be the

3123
02:02:00,119 --> 02:02:03,720
man

3124
02:02:01,159 --> 02:02:06,329
yeah I know I know that it's really

3125
02:02:03,720 --> 02:02:07,530
expensive and whatever like products and

3126
02:02:06,329 --> 02:02:09,479
stuff that they have out there that

3127
02:02:07,529 --> 02:02:10,949
we've seen with in Canada you know

3128
02:02:09,479 --> 02:02:13,229
they're talking about it in the

3129
02:02:10,949 --> 02:02:15,899
pharmaceutical industry big time because

3130
02:02:13,229 --> 02:02:17,759
they Reiter irradiate all different

3131
02:02:15,899 --> 02:02:19,949
types of herbs for supplements that's

3132
02:02:17,760 --> 02:02:21,810
just immediately done if it involves any

3133
02:02:19,949 --> 02:02:23,909
type at the health industry in any way

3134
02:02:21,810 --> 02:02:25,560
then it's going to be irradiated you

3135
02:02:23,909 --> 02:02:27,869
know a lot of our teas are irradiated

3136
02:02:25,560 --> 02:02:29,490
celestial Seasonings all of these

3137
02:02:27,869 --> 02:02:32,430
different types of teas that we might be

3138
02:02:29,489 --> 02:02:35,670
drinking every day that utilize herbs is

3139
02:02:32,430 --> 02:02:37,980
being irradiated and it basically takes

3140
02:02:35,670 --> 02:02:40,289
away you know the entire life force of

3141
02:02:37,979 --> 02:02:42,239
the plant material you know I'd love to

3142
02:02:40,289 --> 02:02:44,460
learn more from art or anything or

3143
02:02:42,239 --> 02:02:46,590
anyone like that and also I would just

3144
02:02:44,460 --> 02:02:48,810
question you know the residue that it

3145
02:02:46,590 --> 02:02:50,819
leaves if we know micro butanol just for

3146
02:02:48,810 --> 02:02:52,740
example is the easiest one you know

3147
02:02:50,819 --> 02:02:55,619
continues to radiate why wouldn't that

3148
02:02:52,739 --> 02:02:58,439
happen in the ganja and what you know

3149
02:02:55,619 --> 02:03:00,180
cyanobacteria is in my Ino other's

3150
02:02:58,439 --> 02:03:01,949
smaller bacteria what kind of those

3151
02:03:00,180 --> 02:03:04,289
probiotic cultures are getting

3152
02:03:01,949 --> 02:03:06,210
irradiated out as well and once again

3153
02:03:04,289 --> 02:03:08,789
you know that's an input to our human

3154
02:03:06,210 --> 02:03:10,619
body and we want like a whole food as

3155
02:03:08,789 --> 02:03:13,470
much as possible that's why whole foods

3156
02:03:10,619 --> 02:03:15,750
not the company but what you know a

3157
02:03:13,470 --> 02:03:18,840
whole food is so important and growing

3158
02:03:15,750 --> 02:03:21,270
your own food is more alive so I mean

3159
02:03:18,840 --> 02:03:23,430
it's just another example of kind of

3160
02:03:21,270 --> 02:03:25,920
processed food it's like it's processed

3161
02:03:23,430 --> 02:03:27,960
weed so yeah you can get it and I don't

3162
02:03:25,920 --> 02:03:29,909
know the specific science on it but I

3163
02:03:27,960 --> 02:03:32,789
mean I don't trust it I wouldn't want to

3164
02:03:29,909 --> 02:03:36,300
have anything to do with it yeah I want

3165
02:03:32,789 --> 02:03:39,800
a pipe in here it seems to me I've read

3166
02:03:36,300 --> 02:03:42,150
in the science that microbiology

3167
02:03:39,800 --> 02:03:44,340
particularly bacteria

3168
02:03:42,149 --> 02:03:48,599
and I imagine fungus have an ability to

3169
02:03:44,340 --> 02:03:51,270
share their DNA and pick up resistance

3170
02:03:48,600 --> 02:03:56,640
from each other and it seems to me that

3171
02:03:51,270 --> 02:03:59,460
era dating microbiology is going to

3172
02:03:56,640 --> 02:04:01,410
explode all of that DNA into a mad soup

3173
02:03:59,460 --> 02:04:04,529
like you are just talking about Josh and

3174
02:04:01,409 --> 02:04:07,789
men time consuming it into the lungs it

3175
02:04:04,529 --> 02:04:10,259
sounds like a really terrible idea to me

3176
02:04:07,789 --> 02:04:12,539
and this just goes to what I was saying

3177
02:04:10,260 --> 02:04:14,550
and I agree with Josh 100% so this goes

3178
02:04:12,539 --> 02:04:16,949
back we can do a whole show on this that

3179
02:04:14,550 --> 02:04:20,940
you know all cannabis has the potential

3180
02:04:16,949 --> 02:04:23,670
for medicinal use but it's not safe or

3181
02:04:20,939 --> 02:04:26,219
good for medicinal use you know and in

3182
02:04:23,670 --> 02:04:29,819
how it's used ism is important and we

3183
02:04:26,220 --> 02:04:32,220
see in the deaths of immune-compromised

3184
02:04:29,819 --> 02:04:35,849
cancer patients and if the cannabis is

3185
02:04:32,220 --> 02:04:38,460
clean and prepared properly so it's it's

3186
02:04:35,850 --> 02:04:40,430
a it's a complex topic that we could do

3187
02:04:38,460 --> 02:04:46,890
a whole show on but I think that really

3188
02:04:40,430 --> 02:04:48,240
highlights that point well yeah we'll

3189
02:04:46,890 --> 02:04:51,329
have to get a little deeper into that

3190
02:04:48,239 --> 02:04:53,399
later on in the year here once we can

3191
02:04:51,329 --> 02:04:56,220
maybe get some more key players involved

3192
02:04:53,399 --> 02:04:58,429
with the conversation I just put our

3193
02:04:56,220 --> 02:05:01,530
nose paper up there on the chat group

3194
02:04:58,430 --> 02:05:03,810
that one's got some measurement of the

3195
02:05:01,529 --> 02:05:05,340
differential effects on the monoterpenes

3196
02:05:03,810 --> 02:05:08,970
and SS the terpenes when you do

3197
02:05:05,340 --> 02:05:10,230
gamma-irradiated with some of those but

3198
02:05:08,970 --> 02:05:12,030
you know that could probably be

3199
02:05:10,229 --> 02:05:14,279
compensated for with you know spike ends

3200
02:05:12,029 --> 02:05:16,259
of senses yeah I had read the paper I

3201
02:05:14,279 --> 02:05:18,840
didn't think that the I knew it was it

3202
02:05:16,260 --> 02:05:23,100
was a change I can't remember it was a

3203
02:05:18,840 --> 02:05:25,529
20 or 30% you know that's not overcome

3204
02:05:23,100 --> 02:05:27,600
with spike ins but bed row Canada's

3205
02:05:25,529 --> 02:05:29,609
considered the you know the

3206
02:05:27,600 --> 02:05:31,860
quote/unquote standard because they were

3207
02:05:29,609 --> 02:05:34,619
the first regulated sort of situation

3208
02:05:31,859 --> 02:05:37,049
but their cannabis is irradiated so you

3209
02:05:34,619 --> 02:05:39,510
know that's just an FYI you know more

3210
02:05:37,050 --> 02:05:41,489
than anything for people to realize that

3211
02:05:39,510 --> 02:05:43,650
you know that's where it is considered

3212
02:05:41,489 --> 02:05:45,989
as an international medicine it needed

3213
02:05:43,649 --> 02:05:48,449
to be that way but that's also as

3214
02:05:45,989 --> 02:05:51,029
everybody was saying a reflection on the

3215
02:05:48,449 --> 02:05:53,849
growers themselves you know the growers

3216
02:05:51,029 --> 02:05:56,039
of that flower there's a need for it to

3217
02:05:53,850 --> 02:06:01,220
be irradiated because it's not

3218
02:05:56,039 --> 02:06:04,439
of molds and mildews period you know

3219
02:06:01,220 --> 02:06:06,690
yeah to make that sloppily and then just

3220
02:06:04,439 --> 02:06:08,759
irradiated where are the mycotoxins and

3221
02:06:06,689 --> 02:06:10,769
then it takes away the responsibility

3222
02:06:08,760 --> 02:06:13,170
from you know possibly really large

3223
02:06:10,770 --> 02:06:15,870
corporations that are just coming in to

3224
02:06:13,170 --> 02:06:18,359
produce money and they're not really

3225
02:06:15,869 --> 02:06:19,829
into producing a you know a health

3226
02:06:18,359 --> 02:06:22,079
product and there's a real

3227
02:06:19,829 --> 02:06:23,519
differentiation with that and I know a

3228
02:06:22,079 --> 02:06:25,800
lot of people that are you know in

3229
02:06:23,520 --> 02:06:27,150
northern Cali and in Southern Oregon and

3230
02:06:25,800 --> 02:06:28,940
people who have brought this culture

3231
02:06:27,149 --> 02:06:31,079
forward you know they're producing a

3232
02:06:28,939 --> 02:06:33,210
culture they're producing you know

3233
02:06:31,079 --> 02:06:35,369
something of importance it's not

3234
02:06:33,210 --> 02:06:38,480
something that you know can just be put

3235
02:06:35,369 --> 02:06:40,529
out onto the market that's just dead

3236
02:06:38,479 --> 02:06:43,319
alright we actually could do a study

3237
02:06:40,529 --> 02:06:45,300
looking at irradiated samples just to

3238
02:06:43,319 --> 02:06:46,859
know what I suspect the DNA is still

3239
02:06:45,300 --> 02:06:48,840
there although it might be there might

3240
02:06:46,859 --> 02:06:52,979
be some finally being cross linkers

3241
02:06:48,840 --> 02:06:53,760
going on sometimes here a crime that

3242
02:06:52,979 --> 02:06:55,949
would be interesting to see whether or

3243
02:06:53,760 --> 02:06:57,720
not we can pick it up because my only

3244
02:06:55,949 --> 02:07:00,090
concern of using something like that is

3245
02:06:57,720 --> 02:07:02,970
that you masked all of these the fact

3246
02:07:00,090 --> 02:07:05,130
that you had tons of mold on the plant

3247
02:07:02,970 --> 02:07:06,420
and the fact that you've made it so it's

3248
02:07:05,130 --> 02:07:07,949
not viable doesn't mean you that you've

3249
02:07:06,420 --> 02:07:11,270
necessarily made it safe because those

3250
02:07:07,949 --> 02:07:13,409
are still a allergen you can still get

3251
02:07:11,270 --> 02:07:15,090
effects like allergies with powdery

3252
02:07:13,409 --> 02:07:16,800
mildew and botrytis and the few places

3253
02:07:15,090 --> 02:07:18,150
i've seen using this have powdery mildew

3254
02:07:16,800 --> 02:07:19,920
everywhere but they don't even bother to

3255
02:07:18,149 --> 02:07:21,210
deal with it or read around it they just

3256
02:07:19,920 --> 02:07:22,710
basically say it doesn't matter we're

3257
02:07:21,210 --> 02:07:26,609
gonna go and radiate it and it'll be

3258
02:07:22,710 --> 02:07:28,079
fine when a culture but it probably

3259
02:07:26,609 --> 02:07:29,880
still has mycotoxins and other allergens

3260
02:07:28,079 --> 02:07:34,109
that are on it that just are we're not

3261
02:07:29,880 --> 02:07:35,640
paying attention to you right now nobody

3262
02:07:34,109 --> 02:07:36,929
got into cannabis cuz they were farmers

3263
02:07:35,640 --> 02:07:38,190
in the first place they got into

3264
02:07:36,930 --> 02:07:40,110
cannabis because they wanted to grow

3265
02:07:38,189 --> 02:07:41,639
some weed so at the end of the day when

3266
02:07:40,109 --> 02:07:43,559
people don't give a [ __ ] or have the

3267
02:07:41,640 --> 02:07:46,289
skills or the background or the support

3268
02:07:43,560 --> 02:07:48,420
I mean what happens what happens and a

3269
02:07:46,289 --> 02:07:50,970
lot of places PE that are legal not

3270
02:07:48,420 --> 02:07:53,460
necessarily in California and but other

3271
02:07:50,970 --> 02:07:55,050
states I mean it's not optimal growing

3272
02:07:53,460 --> 02:07:56,699
conditions I mean there's places in

3273
02:07:55,050 --> 02:07:58,829
Humboldt and on the coast where it's the

3274
02:07:56,699 --> 02:08:01,109
hardest places to grow ever like there's

3275
02:07:58,829 --> 02:08:03,630
not really much choice the mean you've

3276
02:08:01,109 --> 02:08:05,460
got a it's taken some people 2 to 3

3277
02:08:03,630 --> 02:08:07,199
years to refine their skills to be able

3278
02:08:05,460 --> 02:08:09,329
to grow something without p.m. and

3279
02:08:07,199 --> 02:08:11,789
without mold before legalization

3280
02:08:09,329 --> 02:08:14,930
these things because it's just not

3281
02:08:11,789 --> 02:08:18,329
optimal growing conditions or optimal

3282
02:08:14,930 --> 02:08:19,860
greenhouses or spaces to use because of

3283
02:08:18,329 --> 02:08:21,600
legalization puts them in all these

3284
02:08:19,859 --> 02:08:24,000
weird places and so at the end of the

3285
02:08:21,600 --> 02:08:25,829
day irradiation and these things are

3286
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:28,680
gonna exist because they have no

3287
02:08:25,829 --> 02:08:30,119
potential to pump out good [ __ ] in the

3288
02:08:28,680 --> 02:08:31,800
end of the day I mean it's gonna have

3289
02:08:30,119 --> 02:08:33,750
p.m. and it's gonna run through some

3290
02:08:31,800 --> 02:08:35,850
problems and they're not gonna throw

3291
02:08:33,750 --> 02:08:38,069
that [ __ ] away that's just the way this

3292
02:08:35,850 --> 02:08:40,740
mentality goes right now only the craft

3293
02:08:38,069 --> 02:08:42,569
people have the ATS copyin let's throw

3294
02:08:40,739 --> 02:08:44,579
it away and start over let's test our

3295
02:08:42,569 --> 02:08:46,139
soil and figure it out let's you know

3296
02:08:44,579 --> 02:08:47,609
get to the bottom of these things and

3297
02:08:46,140 --> 02:08:49,380
figure out the health of the problem

3298
02:08:47,609 --> 02:08:51,059
because when you go to the business

3299
02:08:49,380 --> 02:08:53,039
trade shows for the most part

3300
02:08:51,060 --> 02:08:54,810
everybody's drinking alcohol and

3301
02:08:53,039 --> 02:08:56,310
cannabis isn't allowed and the one thing

3302
02:08:54,810 --> 02:08:58,770
that you see from booth to booth to

3303
02:08:56,310 --> 02:09:01,470
booth is what kind of spray what kind of

3304
02:08:58,770 --> 02:09:03,930
UV light what kind of technology they

3305
02:09:01,470 --> 02:09:05,909
have to kill mold to kill p.m. to get

3306
02:09:03,930 --> 02:09:08,100
rid of all these things so I mean again

3307
02:09:05,909 --> 02:09:09,989
we're almost like Big Pharma here's the

3308
02:09:08,100 --> 02:09:12,150
pill to fix this here's the pill to fix

3309
02:09:09,989 --> 02:09:14,519
that here's a side-effect take this pill

3310
02:09:12,149 --> 02:09:16,319
oh the hell don't worry about it we got

3311
02:09:14,520 --> 02:09:18,270
a pill you don't need to be healthy so

3312
02:09:16,319 --> 02:09:19,829
you know we're not gonna grow there's

3313
02:09:18,270 --> 02:09:21,510
only a fraction of people that are gonna

3314
02:09:19,829 --> 02:09:23,640
grow healthy and do this right in the

3315
02:09:21,510 --> 02:09:25,470
long run because again the places that

3316
02:09:23,640 --> 02:09:27,090
are legal have the odds against them

3317
02:09:25,470 --> 02:09:29,430
whether it's the whether it's the soil

3318
02:09:27,090 --> 02:09:31,470
and the neighbor spraying [ __ ] and so I

3319
02:09:29,430 --> 02:09:33,420
mean at the end of the day the bubble is

3320
02:09:31,470 --> 02:09:34,949
gonna burst but unfortunately a lot of

3321
02:09:33,420 --> 02:09:37,380
people have thrown in the towel and

3322
02:09:34,949 --> 02:09:39,599
moved away and some things like that up

3323
02:09:37,380 --> 02:09:41,250
north I mean I try to get it past the

3324
02:09:39,600 --> 02:09:42,180
doom and the gloom stories all the time

3325
02:09:41,250 --> 02:09:44,369
and I know there's some cool

3326
02:09:42,180 --> 02:09:46,140
breakthroughs and I mean don't you have

3327
02:09:44,369 --> 02:09:47,819
one coming up here mica don't you have

3328
02:09:46,140 --> 02:09:51,750
something opening up or some cool things

3329
02:09:47,819 --> 02:09:53,099
for leaf expanding opening up or dealing

3330
02:09:51,750 --> 02:09:55,050
some new stuff because I know there's a

3331
02:09:53,100 --> 02:09:57,630
lot of problems and some things going on

3332
02:09:55,050 --> 02:09:59,070
but I know that you had a had shared

3333
02:09:57,630 --> 02:10:04,739
some stuff that you're getting ready to

3334
02:09:59,069 --> 02:10:06,929
do yeah you threw me off there I thought

3335
02:10:04,739 --> 02:10:08,819
as far as projects that we have going on

3336
02:10:06,930 --> 02:10:11,940
yeah we are working on some different

3337
02:10:08,819 --> 02:10:13,979
projects but you know building some new

3338
02:10:11,939 --> 02:10:16,019
facilities and whatnot but you guys are

3339
02:10:13,979 --> 02:10:17,909
organic you guys are like what we talk

3340
02:10:16,020 --> 02:10:20,220
about your craft farmer you're in

3341
02:10:17,909 --> 02:10:21,930
Southern California all the fans just

3342
02:10:20,220 --> 02:10:23,220
kicked on in the back for they go on for

3343
02:10:21,930 --> 02:10:25,320
a few seconds

3344
02:10:23,220 --> 02:10:27,420
you're an organic farmer in northern and

3345
02:10:25,319 --> 02:10:29,279
southern California you're legal you're

3346
02:10:27,420 --> 02:10:32,369
permitted you're testing all over the

3347
02:10:29,279 --> 02:10:34,019
place and you know you're still just you

3348
02:10:32,369 --> 02:10:35,909
don't I don't know if you have a big

3349
02:10:34,020 --> 02:10:37,320
investor behind you anything like that

3350
02:10:35,909 --> 02:10:42,239
but I mean you've always come from a

3351
02:10:37,319 --> 02:10:44,219
small Crafts style farm and not so far

3352
02:10:42,239 --> 02:10:49,099
with it's all on our own you know we

3353
02:10:44,220 --> 02:10:51,960
don't have a big investor behind us but

3354
02:10:49,100 --> 02:10:53,730
yeah our take on it is that you got to

3355
02:10:51,960 --> 02:10:56,010
get it right out of the gate you know so

3356
02:10:53,729 --> 02:10:59,969
your farming techniques have to be down

3357
02:10:56,010 --> 02:11:01,739
and and don't rely on all these new

3358
02:10:59,970 --> 02:11:04,590
things that are popping up with you know

3359
02:11:01,739 --> 02:11:06,239
sprays and I was actually gonna ask you

3360
02:11:04,590 --> 02:11:07,949
guys if someone brought this up to me

3361
02:11:06,239 --> 02:11:10,920
the other day if I had heard anything

3362
02:11:07,949 --> 02:11:13,229
about um the irradiation thing sounds to

3363
02:11:10,920 --> 02:11:15,359
me like it's some sort of pasteurization

3364
02:11:13,229 --> 02:11:17,909
process or something that you know it's

3365
02:11:15,359 --> 02:11:19,619
because of you you screwed up in the

3366
02:11:17,909 --> 02:11:21,720
back you know and your farming

3367
02:11:19,619 --> 02:11:23,819
techniques possibly so it's a way to not

3368
02:11:21,720 --> 02:11:26,340
throw away product that probably should

3369
02:11:23,819 --> 02:11:27,929
be thrown into the trash and someone

3370
02:11:26,340 --> 02:11:29,250
someone was in our in our office the

3371
02:11:27,930 --> 02:11:31,140
other day asking about there's something

3372
02:11:29,250 --> 02:11:33,600
in Colorado that they're introducing

3373
02:11:31,140 --> 02:11:35,280
where it's it's something similar but

3374
02:11:33,600 --> 02:11:36,750
it's a spray they have any of you guys

3375
02:11:35,279 --> 02:11:39,149
heard of that whether they're talking

3376
02:11:36,750 --> 02:11:40,739
about spraying down the flower and the

3377
02:11:39,149 --> 02:11:43,019
different product as a preservative and

3378
02:11:40,739 --> 02:11:45,929
actually turning it into a law they are

3379
02:11:43,020 --> 02:11:48,060
they're talking about doing putting

3380
02:11:45,930 --> 02:11:49,740
tracers on it so they want to spike it

3381
02:11:48,060 --> 02:11:52,830
with some type of molecule they can

3382
02:11:49,739 --> 02:11:54,899
trace I think they're talking about DNA

3383
02:11:52,829 --> 02:11:56,369
but I know it's not clear to me webelo

3384
02:11:54,899 --> 02:11:59,909
has a grant to try and figure this out

3385
02:11:56,369 --> 02:12:01,649
and it seems incredibly foolish to do

3386
02:11:59,909 --> 02:12:03,569
this because you could actually just

3387
02:12:01,649 --> 02:12:05,069
track the DNA itself from the plant you

3388
02:12:03,569 --> 02:12:07,170
know how to do that now and so if you

3389
02:12:05,069 --> 02:12:08,639
really want a barcode just read the

3390
02:12:07,170 --> 02:12:10,260
native DNA of the plant as opposed to

3391
02:12:08,640 --> 02:12:13,079
adding some other DNA to it I mean it

3392
02:12:10,260 --> 02:12:15,840
brings up all types of concerns and you

3393
02:12:13,079 --> 02:12:17,550
start doing that because generally when

3394
02:12:15,840 --> 02:12:19,020
you spray DNA on things it's not going

3395
02:12:17,550 --> 02:12:21,090
to integrate the genome but you know you

3396
02:12:19,020 --> 02:12:23,640
you can get viruses and other things

3397
02:12:21,090 --> 02:12:25,380
bacteria to package that stuff and and

3398
02:12:23,640 --> 02:12:27,270
there could be perhaps off-target

3399
02:12:25,380 --> 02:12:29,130
integration events you know I don't know

3400
02:12:27,270 --> 02:12:30,660
it seems really foolish what they're

3401
02:12:29,130 --> 02:12:32,520
trying to do because it's one more

3402
02:12:30,659 --> 02:12:33,840
compound but I'm not so much worried

3403
02:12:32,520 --> 02:12:35,940
about the DNA because that's fairly

3404
02:12:33,840 --> 02:12:37,500
probably fairly native it's more

3405
02:12:35,939 --> 02:12:39,389
what are they going to package it with

3406
02:12:37,500 --> 02:12:41,219
like what's the foliar spray they

3407
02:12:39,390 --> 02:12:43,530
soluble Iseman it's almost like the

3408
02:12:41,219 --> 02:12:45,569
adjuvant SAR oftentimes more dangerous

3409
02:12:43,529 --> 02:12:49,170
than the actual thing you're trying to

3410
02:12:45,569 --> 02:12:50,639
apply and it's they all they want to do

3411
02:12:49,170 --> 02:12:52,890
this to get taxes you know it's easy

3412
02:12:50,640 --> 02:12:54,630
sales tracking and right now the RFID

3413
02:12:52,890 --> 02:12:56,789
tags are getting ripped off and this is

3414
02:12:54,630 --> 02:12:59,520
only protecting they want to be able to

3415
02:12:56,789 --> 02:13:01,800
trace that they want to be find out

3416
02:12:59,520 --> 02:13:05,790
because we have the same access of

3417
02:13:01,800 --> 02:13:08,340
genetics as anyone else as dispensaries

3418
02:13:05,789 --> 02:13:10,140
they want to figure out if this is from

3419
02:13:08,340 --> 02:13:13,310
the illegal market or if it's from the

3420
02:13:10,140 --> 02:13:15,119
legal market and this is the problem of

3421
02:13:13,310 --> 02:13:17,460
prohibition and the problem of

3422
02:13:15,119 --> 02:13:20,010
reintegration from prohibition now is

3423
02:13:17,460 --> 02:13:22,350
that these straight prohibitionists want

3424
02:13:20,010 --> 02:13:24,300
to figure out any way shape or form to

3425
02:13:22,350 --> 02:13:26,699
[ __ ] with us and a certain result that

3426
02:13:24,300 --> 02:13:30,390
seems to be the case here whereas again

3427
02:13:26,698 --> 02:13:31,738
it could be traced as you say by you

3428
02:13:30,390 --> 02:13:33,270
know actually doing genetic but the

3429
02:13:31,738 --> 02:13:35,879
problem is is that we can genetically

3430
02:13:33,270 --> 02:13:38,520
access the same genetics from the

3431
02:13:35,880 --> 02:13:40,859
illegal market through seeds etc clones

3432
02:13:38,520 --> 02:13:43,050
etc as opposed to what's in the legal

3433
02:13:40,859 --> 02:13:44,789
market so what they're trying to do is

3434
02:13:43,050 --> 02:13:46,770
find a separation between the legal

3435
02:13:44,789 --> 02:13:49,439
produce market in the illegal market

3436
02:13:46,770 --> 02:13:51,500
which I mean they could chase their

3437
02:13:49,439 --> 02:13:54,329
tails forever I mean correct I mean

3438
02:13:51,500 --> 02:13:56,579
trying to make up this sort of mess but

3439
02:13:54,329 --> 02:13:57,988
that's why we're they're doing this

3440
02:13:56,579 --> 02:14:00,600
people because they're just trying to

3441
02:13:57,988 --> 02:14:02,339
figure out how a police if they find a

3442
02:14:00,600 --> 02:14:03,960
type of cannabis and they test it they

3443
02:14:02,340 --> 02:14:05,340
say okay this is from the legal market

3444
02:14:03,960 --> 02:14:07,529
as opposed to oh you bought this

3445
02:14:05,340 --> 02:14:12,890
illegally so they're still trying to use

3446
02:14:07,529 --> 02:14:12,889
this to entrap and to put people in jail

3447
02:14:13,970 --> 02:14:18,360
god that just sounds like it's a

3448
02:14:16,500 --> 02:14:24,539
terrible idea like some sort of spray I

3449
02:14:18,359 --> 02:14:26,639
mean yeah but this yeah this is why you

3450
02:14:24,539 --> 02:14:29,250
have to be active this is why you have

3451
02:14:26,640 --> 02:14:30,900
to go out and meet you know who here

3452
02:14:29,250 --> 02:14:32,880
knows their actual representative who

3453
02:14:30,899 --> 02:14:35,189
has them on speed dial you know this is

3454
02:14:32,880 --> 02:14:36,690
how active you have to be you know only

3455
02:14:35,189 --> 02:14:38,219
two of us a couple of us raised our

3456
02:14:36,689 --> 02:14:40,439
hands here it should be every single one

3457
02:14:38,220 --> 02:14:42,420
of us you know you should know who your

3458
02:14:40,439 --> 02:14:45,079
representative is nunu here's stupidity

3459
02:14:42,420 --> 02:14:47,850
like this my representative is Hillary

3460
02:14:45,079 --> 02:14:49,739
and red she's doing something about it

3461
02:14:47,850 --> 02:14:51,690
right now bless I just text her and I'm

3462
02:14:49,739 --> 02:14:53,250
like you got to talk to these guys get

3463
02:14:51,689 --> 02:14:54,869
it figured out I know you have their

3464
02:14:53,250 --> 02:14:55,909
number see Hillary always comes out

3465
02:14:54,869 --> 02:14:59,099
smelling like a rose

3466
02:14:55,909 --> 02:15:01,319
even when she basically demolishes them

3467
02:14:59,100 --> 02:15:03,120
so like Hillary's done the same thing

3468
02:15:01,319 --> 02:15:06,000
Rosie's done over the years but somehow

3469
02:15:03,119 --> 02:15:08,909
Rosie gets like a rebuttal from Sam on

3470
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:12,409
the web page like bashing her like in a

3471
02:15:08,909 --> 02:15:15,180
public forum that's pretty hardcore

3472
02:15:12,409 --> 02:15:15,989
that's a real honor I would be very

3473
02:15:15,180 --> 02:15:20,100
proud of that

3474
02:15:15,989 --> 02:15:22,409
if I was her oh I'm sure she is I'm sure

3475
02:15:20,100 --> 02:15:24,480
she loves it she's gonna chill it'll

3476
02:15:22,409 --> 02:15:25,979
probably you know this is this is what

3477
02:15:24,479 --> 02:15:27,689
some of these companies don't realize

3478
02:15:25,979 --> 02:15:29,459
and some of these just people that are

3479
02:15:27,689 --> 02:15:32,129
doing the wrong things out there that it

3480
02:15:29,460 --> 02:15:34,409
seems like this day and age is the day

3481
02:15:32,130 --> 02:15:36,090
and age of accountability you know it's

3482
02:15:34,409 --> 02:15:37,619
like you're not might maybe not going to

3483
02:15:36,090 --> 02:15:39,180
be getting away with the same old same

3484
02:15:37,619 --> 02:15:40,800
old [ __ ] that you've been getting

3485
02:15:39,180 --> 02:15:42,450
away for the longest time because now

3486
02:15:40,800 --> 02:15:44,460
people are somewhat organized through

3487
02:15:42,449 --> 02:15:46,590
social media and they're able to gather

3488
02:15:44,460 --> 02:15:48,300
in a way that just makes it so easy that

3489
02:15:46,590 --> 02:15:50,340
suddenly you know you realize there's

3490
02:15:48,300 --> 02:15:52,710
hundreds of thousands or millions of

3491
02:15:50,340 --> 02:16:00,119
people against this particular way of

3492
02:15:52,710 --> 02:16:01,819
thinking and that's what we need and

3493
02:16:00,119 --> 02:16:04,769
guys I gotta get going

3494
02:16:01,819 --> 02:16:08,039
thank thanks for having me I got to take

3495
02:16:04,770 --> 02:16:11,910
off so yeah thanks thanks for talking to

3496
02:16:08,039 --> 02:16:14,640
you guys again I'm glad to have everyone

3497
02:16:11,909 --> 02:16:16,319
back here I'm also actually have to get

3498
02:16:14,640 --> 02:16:19,050
going the lift conference is over in a

3499
02:16:16,319 --> 02:16:20,579
couple hours and it's the last day but I

3500
02:16:19,050 --> 02:16:22,619
want to thank everyone for coming out

3501
02:16:20,579 --> 02:16:24,600
and making time and sharing your your

3502
02:16:22,619 --> 02:16:26,729
stories and your information and I will

3503
02:16:24,600 --> 02:16:27,320
absolutely be inviting you all back

3504
02:16:26,729 --> 02:16:28,729
again

3505
02:16:27,319 --> 02:16:30,408
very soon hopefully for next Sunday

3506
02:16:28,729 --> 02:16:32,029
we'll do another one

3507
02:16:30,408 --> 02:16:34,039
and in the meantime if anyone has any

3508
02:16:32,030 --> 02:16:36,109
ideas on specific conversations that

3509
02:16:34,040 --> 02:16:38,330
they want to discuss we can do specific

3510
02:16:36,109 --> 02:16:41,030
shows where we invite specific panelists

3511
02:16:38,329 --> 02:16:42,829
and I want to sort of do both the spur

3512
02:16:41,030 --> 02:16:44,450
of the moment hash search where whoever

3513
02:16:42,829 --> 02:16:46,728
can come can come and we'll make that

3514
02:16:44,450 --> 02:16:49,550
happen but also have some times where we

3515
02:16:46,728 --> 02:16:51,949
actually create and and produce a show

3516
02:16:49,549 --> 02:16:53,209
for a special Sunday where specific

3517
02:16:51,950 --> 02:16:54,920
people are coming in to talk about

3518
02:16:53,209 --> 02:16:57,678
specific things and they make sure that

3519
02:16:54,920 --> 02:17:00,319
they have the time and the space to do

3520
02:16:57,679 --> 02:17:02,359
that and in the meantime yeah we'll be

3521
02:17:00,319 --> 02:17:05,329
posting all the links in the hash Church

3522
02:17:02,359 --> 02:17:07,729
Facebook page in regards to things that

3523
02:17:05,329 --> 02:17:09,530
we talked about I know Kevin is probably

3524
02:17:07,728 --> 02:17:11,478
already doing it but he'll post some

3525
02:17:09,530 --> 02:17:15,559
things in that Facebook page as he often

3526
02:17:11,478 --> 02:17:17,779
does and just keep on keeping on

3527
02:17:15,558 --> 02:17:20,299
everybody y'all doing great jobs great

3528
02:17:17,780 --> 02:17:21,859
work and I'm want to thank Shawn for

3529
02:17:20,299 --> 02:17:24,799
hanging out and sitting with me Shawn's

3530
02:17:21,859 --> 02:17:27,530
a local organic farmer here who can be

3531
02:17:24,799 --> 02:17:29,569
found on Instagram at lost gardens and a

3532
02:17:27,530 --> 02:17:32,570
righteous brother from another mother

3533
02:17:29,569 --> 02:17:34,939
so we're we're gonna head off to lift

3534
02:17:32,569 --> 02:17:37,549
and and see if we can't talk some sense

3535
02:17:34,939 --> 02:17:41,139
into some of these cannabis parasites

3536
02:17:37,549 --> 02:17:44,148
and I'm not talking about mites or or

3537
02:17:41,138 --> 02:17:46,579
some of these other real sort of

3538
02:17:44,148 --> 02:17:48,858
cannabis parasites that are sort of

3539
02:17:46,579 --> 02:17:50,478
