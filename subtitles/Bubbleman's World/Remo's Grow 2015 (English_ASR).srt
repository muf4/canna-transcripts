6
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,719
have an absolutely breathtaking Sunrise

7
00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:39,359
happening on the way over to his place

8
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:42,160
here as I head east on the Trans Canada

9
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:44,159
heading over to Remo's place I'm excited

10
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:46,519
I haven't seen Remo in a little

11
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:49,398
while he's been doing all sorts of

12
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:51,760
amazing things he's uh started himself a

13
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:53,520
new company he has himself a new

14
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:58,119
Warehouse they're doing all sorts of

15
00:00:53,520 --> 00:01:00,320
different um foods and rooting gels and

16
00:00:58,119 --> 00:01:03,119
basically you know he's he's really

17
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,920
taking himself to The Next Step he's no

18
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:08,200
longer with Advanced Nutrients but he's

19
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:11,079
sort of on his own and uh just promoting

20
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:13,840
uh promoting the rean the Remo Urban

21
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:16,400
grower brand and uh it's always a

22
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,840
pleasure to go see Remo the guys got one

23
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,759
of the nicest Gardens I've ever had the

24
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:23,200
pleasure of visiting um I'll tell

25
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:25,200
you it'll be interesting to see what

26
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,439
happens in the future of Canada and the

27
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,960
future of cannabis because uh you know

28
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:31,919
this guy Remo is going to have a

29
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:31,919
position in it somewhere

30
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:41,199
so I guess we will see him soon all

31
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:42,798
right guys I am here at Remo's office

32
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,719
just chilling out this is usually where

33
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:48,079
we're puffing bowls and enjoying um you

34
00:01:45,718 --> 00:01:49,798
know the resin that we love so much

35
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:51,759
Remo's inside the room right now which

36
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:54,399
is just through this door and another

37
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:57,079
door and he is watering his plants we

38
00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:00,478
noticed his 5 ton air conditioner had

39
00:01:57,078 --> 00:02:03,359
about 55 gallons of water um

40
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:05,640
saved up and that's basically when he

41
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:08,399
realizes it's time to water the plants

42
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:11,598
so he's in there watering plants I'm

43
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,439
about to go in with my macro lens and

44
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:15,719
get you guys those photos that you so

45
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:18,959
crave always a pleasure to photograph at

46
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:20,280
Remos because the quality of the resin

47
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,039
the quality of the plants and the

48
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,598
quality of the grow is just so on point

49
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:26,878
that it's just it's comfortable for me

50
00:02:24,598 --> 00:02:31,039
to be in there thank you method sevens

51
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:33,280
for the HPS glasses the new coups um um

52
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:34,679
I'm able to close shut off all the fans

53
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,159
so the plants aren't moving and the

54
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,760
temperature remains quite cool I never

55
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:42,318
get too hot in Remo's rooms nor to his

56
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:45,158
plants and he never seems to have any

57
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:46,560
type of nutrient burn whatsoever so I

58
00:02:45,158 --> 00:02:48,039
believe this is one of the first crops

59
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,120
I'll be photographing that was grown

60
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:51,959
with his new line of nutrients and I'll

61
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,000
let him tell you about that a little bit

62
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:57,319
uh after I photograph the plants so why

63
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,318
don't we go see what Remo's up

64
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,840
to

65
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,400
always a good idea to have a door

66
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:06,399
between the

67
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:09,860
[Music]

68
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:19,680
door and get the white balance on point

69
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,360
for you

70
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:26,439
guys so the plants are nice and normal

71
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:29,360
looking hey yeah I'm going he's a

72
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:30,400
hardworking man water in my PL yeah

73
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,799
buddy

74
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,280
we're in week six here we're just uh

75
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,360
giving it some water we're

76
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:39,239
leeching just giving it just a plain

77
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,560
condensate well everything looks

78
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:43,400
absolutely spectacular as always uh

79
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,598
these are my own nutrients this time you

80
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,760
know I was just saying that on the other

81
00:03:44,598 --> 00:03:47,560
side of the door that this will be the

82
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:50,120
first time I've actually photographed

83
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:52,560
using the macro lens plants that have

84
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:55,239
used your nutrients so that's pretty

85
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,719
exciting the whole line hey oh yeah and

86
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:59,799
I'm quite satisfied with it um we we've

87
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:01,239
doing some tweaking on it and I I think

88
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:03,239
think we got a a product that the public

89
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:04,759
will be totally happy with I'm happy

90
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:06,480
with it if I'm happy I know you're going

91
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:08,479
to be happy well I can say this much

92
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:11,840
right off the bat that it's definitely

93
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:14,000
up to par with what I consider you to

94
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,519
produce oh nice just from opening the

95
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,918
door these look

96
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:23,519
unbelievable healthy zero root uh n Burn

97
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:26,399
I can see the resin glistening from

98
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:28,279
here it looks like standard killer stuff

99
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:31,038
for

100
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:33,000
sure yeah and I I guess really the best

101
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:36,759
uh you know better than any machine that

102
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,918
you could buy the bioassay of of Remo

103
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:40,520
that seems to work actually the first

104
00:04:38,918 --> 00:04:43,240
nutrients have come off for assembly

105
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:44,758
line I want you to have take home and

106
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,680
grow your plants with it oh that'd be

107
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:49,360
really cool I do a little for bubble man

108
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,199
I do a little Remo experiment yeah

109
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,160
that'd be awesome dude I'm going to take

110
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,639
these guys for a little walk through

111
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,000
your amazing garden show them a little

112
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:58,600
bit about what I'm about to get the

113
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,399
macro lens out and then I guess I'll

114
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:03,320
start doing photos crazy I'm going to

115
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:06,638
continue watering yes you keep working

116
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:06,639
buddy back to work all

117
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:15,159
right Big Unit

118
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:17,639
there so always just the most ridiculous

119
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:19,639
quality when it comes to

120
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:21,400
Remo I mean it might sound like I'm

121
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:24,120
blowing smoke up his ass but I'm telling

122
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:26,879
you I've been in a lot of Grow

123
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,439
rooms and the amount of work that goes

124
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:32,159
into this

125
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:32,160
one is very

126
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,600
impressive always good for fall colors

127
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,639
that's what I can always guarantee that

128
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm going to get when I hit Remo's room

129
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,240
doesn't matter the time of the year

130
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,680
because he controls most of the

131
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,560
variables in the room from the

132
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,360
temperatures to the humidities to how

133
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:55,360
often the plants are watered to how wet

134
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,520
they stay it all ends up really showing

135
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,240
in the end

136
00:05:56,519 --> 00:06:01,599
product really excited to photograph

137
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:04,000
these plants because I've never

138
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,400
photographed anything grown with Remo's

139
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,399
nutrients you know it's not just anyone

140
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:10,679
that can just produce a nutrient company

141
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:12,359
I mean I'm sure a lot of people think

142
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,120
it's a very simple thing you you get

143
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:16,720
your NPK but as I was talking to Remo

144
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,199
earlier there are a lot of variations

145
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,080
and there's a lot of different qualities

146
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,240
in the materials that you can use for

147
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:26,758
nutrients and some companies will cut

148
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:28,519
corners while others will not so I have

149
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:31,280
a pretty strong feeling that Remo's

150
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:33,758
nutrient company will be on the not cut

151
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:33,758
Corners

152
00:06:40,918 --> 00:06:45,560
list all right so we got oh look at that

153
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:49,639
already down to the bottom of the

154
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:52,800
barrel out holy smokes man it's actually

155
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:52,800
pretty impressive that was a

156
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:58,639
55gal labor of love

157
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:02,160

173
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:06,158
stretchy smells amazing though it really

174
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:08,639

175
00:08:06,158 --> 00:08:08,639
well give it a

176
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:14,080
little oo yeah that's that's a nice

177
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:16,560
taste put those method sevens on so I

178
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:19,038
don't have to uh squint so

179
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,519
much you guys have the natural method

180
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:21,918
sevens cuz I'm controlling my white

181
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:24,478
balance right now with the camera so

182
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:27,318
you're seeing everything as uh under

183
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:29,079
regular light however HPS lights are

184
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:31,960
always going to produce this very orange

185
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:33,240
light so if you want to avoid that slap

186
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:37,319
on some method

187
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,320
