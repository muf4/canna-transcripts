2
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:24,500
so you got to give me a quick blurb from

3
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:26,850
my youtube channel on on the case today

4
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:29,429
well it was a pretty tough day in court

5
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:31,560
today yeah tell them what we what we

6
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:36,179
were there for okay well we were in

7
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:39,689
court today with former employee of mine

8
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:42,000
Owen Smith who was charged with

9
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:45,929
trafficking THC or possession for the

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,500
purpose after having been caught making

11
00:00:45,929 --> 00:00:51,479
cookies in a bakery for a dispensary

12
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,210
that I used to own the cannabis buyers

13
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:57,238
club in Victoria that was four years ago

14
00:00:54,210 --> 00:01:01,049
a year and a half ago Supreme Court

15
00:00:57,238 --> 00:01:02,669
justice Johnson ruled that need medical

16
00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:05,128
marijuana access regulations were

17
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:07,259
unconstitutional because they didn't

18
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:11,880
allow patients to make derivatives you

19
00:01:07,259 --> 00:01:14,700
know cookies tea hash oil any extract of

20
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:17,938
cannabis is technically illegal you're

21
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:20,159
only allowed dried cannabis to grow and

22
00:01:17,938 --> 00:01:22,678
use as medicine according to the strict

23
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,749
interpretation of the law the judge

24
00:01:22,679 --> 00:01:28,310
again struck that down a year and a half

25
00:01:24,748 --> 00:01:30,298
ago the court are sorry that the

26
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:33,359
Department of Justice appealed that

27
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:35,429
decision which is their very word today

28
00:01:33,358 --> 00:01:38,908
in front of three judges at the Court of

29
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:41,819
Appeal of British Columbia appealing the

30
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:45,060
decision that would allow us to possess

31
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:46,680
cannabis resin and extracts as opposed

32
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:50,159
to just dried marijuana

33
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:53,100
yeah the crown appealed that decision

34
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,689
the Crown's wish the Health Canada and

35
00:01:53,099 --> 00:01:56,969
Department of Justice is to essentially

36
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:58,909
have you know exceptions made for

37
00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:02,099
cannabis marijuana but cannabis resin

38
00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:05,069
and all of the other derivatives and the

39
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:06,839
Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and

40
00:02:05,069 --> 00:02:13,139
their thinking should remain illegal

41
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:15,270
right and so yeah it was a frustrating

42
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:20,179
day a lot of the Crown's positions don't

43
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:23,070
seem very reasonable but the judges

44
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:25,770
unfortunately seem to be an agreement

45
00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:27,329
with the crown before the Dave and

46
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:29,670
started you know they did read the

47
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:32,310
material beforehand so you know they're

48
00:02:29,669 --> 00:02:37,349
gonna come in with an opinions but they

49
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:41,159
really did seemed really opposed to

50
00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:43,979
granting an acquittal to Owen or

51
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:47,370
allowing him to just walk free I think

52
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:49,500
it really bugged them that the cannabis

53
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:51,090
buyers club they don't know the history

54
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,560
of the cannabis buyers club with when

55
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:55,310
they ran in the court decision is that

56
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:59,430
were an unincorporated nontox paying

57
00:02:55,310 --> 00:03:02,310
non-compliant organization right we

58
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:06,209
don't comply with the single law not tax

59
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:09,300
laws Health and Safety Act you know

60
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:13,140
nothing you know and and so I think the

61
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:17,610
judges really struggle with just letting

62
00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:21,389
us us go as an organization because

63
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:25,200
patients have a constitutional right to

64
00:03:21,389 --> 00:03:29,849
this medicine hopefully Kirk was able to

65
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:32,399
convince them otherwise but you know

66
00:03:29,849 --> 00:03:34,289
it's tough to say a couple of the judges

67
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,469
really didn't seem very favorable to us

68
00:03:34,289 --> 00:03:39,629
but by the end of the day I think Kirk

69
00:03:37,469 --> 00:03:41,819
ed had made some points that they might

70
00:03:39,629 --> 00:03:43,560
not have considered earlier I thought so

71
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:45,650
as well that he made some decent points

72
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,479
and at least educated them a little bit

73
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:49,490
definitely and so we've got a bit of a

74
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:53,449
wait now people

75
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:55,610
you hear me yeah the weights gonna kill

76
00:03:53,449 --> 00:03:56,060
us will not kill us but it's gonna be

77
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,460
tough

78
00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:00,680
it could be three months it's likely

79
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:04,490
four to six months but it could be

80
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:07,159
eleven ten months as I said earlier you

81
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:10,520
can have a baby in less time than it may

82
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:14,719
take for this decision to come but it

83
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:16,100
will come and it looks quite likely that

84
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:19,939
we'll be going to the Supreme Court of

85
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:21,530
Canada now I I would hope there's going

86
00:04:19,939 --> 00:04:23,750
to be a dissenting judge one way or

87
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:25,039
another but we may go on the losing end

88
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:31,129
you know and there may be a couple

89
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:32,780
judges go against us but we'll see well

90
00:04:31,129 --> 00:04:36,649
it's the big fight Ted and I certainly

91
00:04:32,779 --> 00:04:38,179
thank you guys for you know doing it I'm

92
00:04:36,649 --> 00:04:39,679
there with you guys I'm ready to stand

93
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:42,590
on the front line with you guys as well

94
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,900
because this is an important an

95
00:04:42,589 --> 00:04:48,529
important decision for a lot of people

96
00:04:44,899 --> 00:04:51,799
in Canada welcome it's a very important

97
00:04:48,529 --> 00:04:53,829
matter you know I hope we've done a good

98
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:56,449
enough job that we've changed things so

99
00:04:53,829 --> 00:04:59,469
we'll see how it goes I think sue Minter

100
00:04:56,449 --> 00:04:59,469
well thanks a lot
