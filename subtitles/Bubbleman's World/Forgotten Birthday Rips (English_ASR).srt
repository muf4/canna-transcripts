today it might be a birthday video I may

61
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:43,179
just make the video this little short

62
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:46,379
introduction and that could be it but

63
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:49,840
depending on who comes by who shares

64
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:51,280
different hashes with me I might have to

65
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,870
make that a video as well I know Johnny

66
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,569

67
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:57,460
telling me earlier that he is crushing

00:03:55,569 --> 00:04:01,000
some full Kongo plants over the screens

69
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:02,680
probably right now as I say this so that

70
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,900
would be exciting and then I've invited

71
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:07,270
some other people from the community and

72
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:08,069
so hopefully we'll see some of them as

73
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:11,350

74
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:14,379

80
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,680
the morning editing videos for you guys

81
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:32,769
for the channel still trying to catch up

82
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:35,410
on the Barcelona shots my neighbor must

83
00:04:32,769 --> 00:04:37,180
hear that I'm outside about to film he's

84
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:38,950
decided to turn his bandsaw on which is

85
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:40,449
pretty much what he's done every time in

86
00:04:38,949 --> 00:04:42,519
the last two years since I've been out

87
00:04:40,449 --> 00:04:43,599
here but that's ok you guys a pretty

88
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:46,359
cool audience you don't mind a little

89
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:49,030
band song a little circular song a

90
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:53,050
little jig song I figured I was gonna

91
00:04:49,029 --> 00:04:55,509
take a little rip I got the new banger

92
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:56,819
there from DC glass so I'm pretty stoked

93
00:04:55,509 --> 00:04:59,939
on that

94
00:04:56,819 --> 00:05:02,670
give it a little go go

95
00:04:59,939 --> 00:05:05,850
all right

96
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:09,750
there we go birthday rips in the pock

97
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:09,750
it's probably gonna do a dunk

98
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:15,279
real thick glass on this on these DC

99
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,660
pieces there I don't know if they're

100
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:19,029
three millimeters and what it is the

101
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:21,370
thickness but they're very thick and

102
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:22,689
they're definitely a little bit tricky

103
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:24,399
the first time you heat them up because

104
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:27,100
you don't know how hot it is it doesn't

105
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:30,179
really turn orange the first several

106
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,180
times that you turn it up

107
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:57,869
right time for a dunk through the fab

108
00:05:55,629 --> 00:05:57,870
egg

[Music]

110
00:06:19,529 --> 00:06:23,788
nice taste maybe it maybe just a little

111
00:06:21,939 --> 00:06:27,389
bit hot but

112
00:06:23,788 --> 00:06:27,389
still pretty darn nice

113
