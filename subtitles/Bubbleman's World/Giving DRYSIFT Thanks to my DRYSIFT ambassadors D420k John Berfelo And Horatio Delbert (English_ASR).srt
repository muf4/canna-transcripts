11
00:00:39,878 --> 00:00:43,920

12
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,198
outerwear by

13
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,359
DNA super stoked on uh on the work that

14
00:00:47,198 --> 00:00:51,960
you guys are doing unity in the

15
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:54,320
community so I thought I would just uh

16
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,520
do a short little uh uh video here with

17
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,960
you guys I've got some unbelievably

18
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,680
beautiful dry sifts um it really has

19
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,118
paid off sharing all this information

20
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:07,200
with my friends from d420 K to Johnny

21
00:01:04,118 --> 00:01:10,239
Burell to Horatio Delbert between those

22
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,879
three guys they are basically um my dry

23
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:13,519
sift ambassadors right now they're

24
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:17,359
really taking it to the next level of

25
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:18,920
course Horatio will always be the LH guy

26
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:20,599
but he's a smart enough cookie to know

27
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,359
that if he's going to really know what

28
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:24,319
he's dealing with from the start to the

29
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:27,920
finish that it's important that he

30
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:29,438
acquires an unadulterated canabo profile

31
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,719
and what better way to do that than

32
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:35,398
through the wonderful uh mechanical

33
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:39,078
separations of screen sifting so what

34
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:40,680
I've got here is I've got the Jamaican

35
00:01:39,078 --> 00:01:41,959
the Lamb's bread from Johnny B that

36
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,880
we're going to start it out with thank

37
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:46,599
you so much Johnny B you made such a

38
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:48,319
small amount and you gave it to me and I

39
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:51,599
just uh it just goes to show you're such

40
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:53,478
a a super super human being I'm lucky to

41
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:55,599
call you my friend and for those of you

42
00:01:53,478 --> 00:01:57,959
out there that don't know about Johnny B

43
00:01:55,599 --> 00:02:01,640
go check them out 420 weedmas on

44
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:04,679
Instagram John H Bell on Facebook and

45
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:06,159
John Bell on YouTube so check him out

46
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,719
we're going to hit the Jamaican Lamb's

47
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,800
bread that I brought back in 1995 after

48
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:14,120
being married in Jamaica give thanks

49
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,120
Jamaica give thanks Johnny

50
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:31,759
B

51
00:02:32,598 --> 00:02:37,799
nice and creamy on that get some of

52
00:02:35,318 --> 00:02:39,799
these glass pieces out of the way my new

53
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,040
quartz Banger from dabinator and my new

54
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,480
16

55
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:48,199
mil nail as well as a a male to male so

56
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:50,119
it can fit the female on my piece and

57
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:53,238
then uh what do we got we have the

58
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:55,680
Jamaican that was so delicious can't

59
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:58,759
even really Express how different of a

60
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,519
flavor that Jamaican is it's

61
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:02,280
really

62
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:03,760
it's difficult um I'm going to have to

63
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,439
pay a little bit more attention to that

64
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:06,878
one I don't have a ton of it but it

65
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:08,479
seems like one that would take a couple

66
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:11,318
of weeks to really get used to the

67
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:14,399
subtle differences of uh of the flavors

68
00:03:11,318 --> 00:03:16,119
and the highs I've also wondered because

69
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,560
it doesn't taste exactly what it tasted

70
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:20,280
like in Jamaica and I have a feeling

71
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,878
that it's that tropical sungrown sativa

72
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,919
that hasn't been able to produce the

73
00:03:21,878 --> 00:03:25,318
same tarpine profile grown under lights

74
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:28,199
although I will say John did an

75
00:03:25,318 --> 00:03:30,598
exceptional job uh the resin is really

76
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:33,438
really nice damn

77
00:03:30,598 --> 00:03:35,679
white so we're going to go we've hit the

78
00:03:33,438 --> 00:03:38,199
quartz pooking B bowl with the denail

79
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,599
now we've got the denail whip with their

80
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:43,158
brand new sick uh which is the silicon

81
00:03:40,598 --> 00:03:44,639
carbide nail and I've got it in my

82
00:03:43,158 --> 00:03:46,759
Straight Fab and it's actually plugged

83
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:48,798
into the new nail the dabinator

84
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:52,078
so I think what we're going to try on

85
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:55,040
this one is some of Horatio's new live

86
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:58,879
sift all right you seen this guys live

87
00:03:55,039 --> 00:04:03,120
sift you seen it here first this is dry

88
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:05,679
sift that he has added Tarpin to so I've

89
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,640
got a quite a photo of this I might not

90
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,400
show it in this in this particular video

91
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:12,158
but it will get shown um really

92
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,840
interesting it almost looks like GID

93
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:16,839
Up's live resin it looks like it's wet

94
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:19,759
almost or

95
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:22,079
crystallized um buttery it looks very

96
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,639
buttery but I'll tell you the taste on

97
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:27,918
it especially off the silicon carbide

98
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:30,918
nail is absolutely tremendous so here we

99
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:32,839
go with a little I guess uh Seven Star

100
00:04:30,918 --> 00:04:35,879
as Horatio calls it I like to call it

101
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:38,319
the uh sift the turp sift which is what

102
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:40,639
we called it in um Amsterdam when Tony

103
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:43,079
and I made the first batch ever but

104
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,800
Horatio's got his own his own Vibes and

105
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:46,719
he's really thinking that the seven star

106
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,280
is going to be the name so Props to you

107
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:52,000
Horatio I respect your name # sstar

108
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:52,000
going down right

109
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,560
here

110
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:21,680
now the flavor on that is absolutely

111
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:24,038
unbelievable how

112
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:27,639
strong and

113
00:05:24,038 --> 00:05:31,478
deep and plant Mattery not in a bad way

114
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:31,478
Plant Mattery but in a good way

115
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:36,359
talking about it with ratio the other

116
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:39,198
day the taste that I get is almost fresh

117
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:41,120
squeezed carrots and that's just the the

118
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,840
background of the flavor and I I suspect

119
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:47,160
that's the intensity of the added

120
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:49,758
Tarpin producing a a a taste that would

121
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:52,560
otherwise not be that strong might not

122
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:55,560
pick up the carrots uh smell but I'll

123
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,519
tell you when you get it that

124
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,478
concentrated you can really taste it

125
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:02,839
it's almost like cannabis carrots really

126
00:05:59,478 --> 00:06:05,598
really lovely got to uh got to love guys

127
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:07,839
like Tony and and Horatio

128
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:09,639
who really put their thoughts into

129
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:11,918
things they really put their minds

130
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:13,720
forward and they love to Pioneer things

131
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:15,279
and I don't think it's an accident that

132
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:18,560
all of us have come together here in the

133
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:21,079
last year so let's see we've got the

134
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,598
straight Fab we've got the Fab egg now

135
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:26,399
what number three are we going to hit we

136
00:06:22,598 --> 00:06:29,598
got to represent d420 k d420

137
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:31,799
k probably the most generous dryft kick

138
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:34,519
down I've ever had in my life had some

139
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,478
pretty nice ones nothing compared to to

140
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:38,719
what D brought me the last time that he

141
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:42,560
was here it was a lot of hard work to

142
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:44,800
make this sift a lot of value once you

143
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:48,000
get it and to just be to just give it

144
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,439
away the way d420 K did just want to

145
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,279

Kick-Ass guys I really just can't say

161
00:07:27,478 --> 00:07:34,878
enough good about John Horatio d420 K

162

amazing glass that they've hooked me up
