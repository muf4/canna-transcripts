168
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,478

169
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:27,758

172
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:35,800
by a bee the other day so I kind of have

173
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:39,439

who you got stung by a bee on your face

175
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:44,360

they do sting but sting they hurt and

183
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:05,918
when you get it on your face I can't

184
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,439
even imagine we have a lot of bears

185

200
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:45,279
the the Wasps are really awesome and you

201
00:08:42,918 --> 00:08:46,919
can just be like hey I'm here but when

202
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:48,559
they're house gets ripped out of the

203
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:50,599
ground by a bear they're just they're

204
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:53,719
pissed off

205
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,519
so so that's what happened a a bear open

206
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,560
that

207
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:59,759
up yeah yeah we had a bear at Mama and

208
00:08:57,559 --> 00:09:02,159
two Cubs in the tree and I I think she

209
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:03,919
dug it out with her two Cubs we got the

210
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:06,039
same thing in Lions Bay right now they

211
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:08,199
were in my neighbor's yard yesterday two

212
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:10,719
Cubs and a and a mama just cruising

213
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:13,320
around it's uh you know black bear is no

214
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,399
problem Squamish has had a grizzly bear

215
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,680
hanging out for the last month and they

216
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:18,399
finally were like yeah you know what as

217
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:20,278
cool as we are we got to get rid of this

218
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,360
grizzly bear because this thing's 700

219
00:09:20,278 --> 00:09:24,439
pounds and it can literally eat people

220
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,839
out of their cars so they they had to

221
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:28,600
put it in a you know trap it and bring

222
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:31,200
bring it up north I suspect up to the

223
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:33,000
yakum valley or something like that

224
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,160

that you wrote about Horatio the other

244
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,959
day in the hash Church there I was quite

245
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:30,479
uh taken back by those words it was I

246
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:33,518
know we had our own discussion but it

247
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,519
was it was nice to see you know he uh he

248
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:38,278
was a very I'll never forget the first

249
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:40,159
time I met Horatio through Johnny B John

250
00:10:38,278 --> 00:10:42,000
was you know John's always like excited

251
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:44,759
like a kid in a candy store you know

252
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,600
he's like excited like a kid in a candy

253
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:49,919
store he's legitimately like you can't

254
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,240
be upset with John because his his his

255
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:54,120
excitement is that of a small child he

256
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,919
is so excited about Whatever It Is Well

257
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,120
he came to me this time and he was like

258
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:59,799
dude I met this guy he's doing

259
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:02,159
extractions with lemon they're like

260
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:04,000
tpine extractions I got it right here

261
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:05,679
you got to try it with me he's like

262
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,159
Beyond excited and I'm like I'm kind of

263
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:08,559
like he gives me some and I kind of put

264
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:10,278
it on my desk and I'm like I'm not

265
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:11,599
touching that [ __ ] shady [ __ ] like I

266
00:11:10,278 --> 00:11:14,000
can just I'll just leave that right

267
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,440
there and then time kind of went by and

268
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,159
I was kind of like I was looking at it I

269
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,839
was like this stuff does kind of look

270
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:22,719
crazy [ __ ] it's got that crazy smell so

271
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:25,839
finally I took a dab of this [ __ ] and uh

272
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:29,399
it was definitely the early um Inception

273
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:31,760
of Horatio's um of his extractions and

274
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:35,078
I'm sure it was Dr Mark who helped him

275
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:38,039
uh figure out how to distill out the

276
00:11:35,078 --> 00:11:40,958
Citrus oils the 5% Citrus oils that show

277
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:43,000
up in a five gallon tub of delemon and

278
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:45,399
these are if you watch the inner sanctum

279
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,200
with Horatio and I that's where I did my

280
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:48,799
first solvent extraction he actually had

281
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,680
me pour the lemoning through the tube

282
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:54,679
There You Go Bubba Kush right there uh

283
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:57,120
uh you're on mute Johnny B he's got the

284
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:59,278
D lemoning right there and this is the

285
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,320
number one so the very first one he made

286
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:03,600
is actually sitting on my desk in my

287
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:06,040
office and it was with Med which was

288
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,800
pretty cool um and and yeah like you

289
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:11,199

290
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:13,399
night smoke shop through Brandon and

291
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,199
uh in the basement and they were like

292
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:17,879
you got to meet this guy downstairs he's

293
00:12:15,198 --> 00:12:21,039
like just like amazing and I'm like

294
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:23,879
what that's how I met her ratio was

295
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:26,559
through Brandon through night smoke show

296
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:27,720
and Rihanna and Rihanna yeah and then I

297
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:28,879
went down there and like this guy's all

298
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,278
about research just like you are John

299
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:32,439
you gotta down and talk to this guy and

300
00:12:30,278 --> 00:12:35,838
I went down there like he I'm John he's

301
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:39,240
like uh I've be making these extractions

302
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:41,880
and I'm like I need I think he found me

303
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:45,560
through I I think he found me through

304
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:48,078
Jim fra remember remember Jim Marcus he

305
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:51,919
did and so so Jim and I were on an Adam

306
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:56,519
dun show maybe I want to say um like

307
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:59,559
right around um just before 420 uh in

308
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:03,360
2014 and so Horatio had reached out to

309
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:06,599
me and um I don't even think he knew who

310
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,278
I was I mean I I and I barely used face

311
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,560
well I didn't barely use Facebook but I

312
00:13:08,278 --> 00:13:12,240
didn't use it really to reach out sort

313
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:13,599
of to cannabis people he was one of the

314
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,799
first people who sort of reached out to

315
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,240
me and just started asking all kinds of

316
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:20,639
questions and it turned into a a

317
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,560
relationship where I gave him some

318
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:26,519
background references on how to

319
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:29,638
purify uh lyine because he had been

320
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:31,759
getting it from maybe not to both

321
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:34,320
sources and there was really a lot of

322
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:36,838
question around you know well what is

323
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:39,240
this you know the intended use for

324
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:41,560
because it is used in foods it's you

325
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:44,720
know and derived from from Citrus the

326
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:46,759
Citrus industry but it is filled with

327
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,040
all kinds of nasty [ __ ] in a technical

328
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:52,679
grade like they have like a 85% grade

329
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:55,879
and there's 15% other stuff and this was

330
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:59,159
simultaneous with having the discussions

331
00:13:55,879 --> 00:14:00,799

00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:10,078
I went back and I listened to every hash

335
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:13,680
Church up to the hash Church where I had

336
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:16,519

337
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:19,559
like texting me during hash Church like

338
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:22,720
not texting but sending me a Facebook

339
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:25,559
Messenger things on hey Tony is saying

340
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,920
this Tony is saying this is this right

341
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:30,399
having me like you know check up on what

342
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:32,120
Tony was saying because Tony was on on

343
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,399
hash church and then finally he's like

344
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:37,399
you should come on and and talk about

345
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:41,159

from Amsterdam I think or J Jamaica no a

349
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:54,518
Amsterdam I think because hash Church 18

350
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:55,958
your episode was going over to Amsterdam

351
00:14:54,519 --> 00:15:00,039
and then you were over there for a week

352
00:14:55,958 --> 00:15:02,599
and then you were in the airport in

353
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:05,559
Toronto and um it was just me and

354
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:08,720
Horatio at first on that episode episode

355
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:12,198
number 19 so that was a the my my first

356
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,839
episode on hash church that's awesome

357
00:15:12,198 --> 00:15:15,399
yeah life wasn't the same so it kind of

358
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,199
forced me to go back and look at that

359
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:20,159
but it also looked I went back and

360
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:22,278
looked at this long messenger thread

361
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:24,360
that we had and it's like my gosh he

362
00:15:22,278 --> 00:15:25,838
would just spill his guts about all

363
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,240
kinds of things you know and I know

364
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:30,000
there was a little bit of a falling out

365
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:32,198
there for some time he had a falling out

366
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,440
with Kenny he thought that Kenny Trion

367
00:15:32,198 --> 00:15:37,599
Kenny was going to sue him for some

368
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:40,000
thing or so I I I don't exactly recall

369
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,800
but um the the turps it's funny how it

370
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,519
all connects he unloaded like a three

371
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:47,879
page you know just ah I just don't know

372
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,679
what to do and you know I can't really

373
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:51,919
you know I have to think about myself

374
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:54,198
and I was just like hey man just keep

375
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:56,318
doing your thing and you know stay pure

376
00:15:54,198 --> 00:16:00,000
to what you do and again like I was

377
00:15:56,318 --> 00:16:01,799
saying in my Facebook post that his last

378
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,120
message to me which was about a year and

379
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:06,078
a half ago is like a little incoherent

380
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,360
it's like didn't really make sense I I

381
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:09,799
didn't really know what he was talking

382
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:13,079
about but uh I knew he was going through

383
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:15,399
some some difficult times so it it was

384
00:16:13,078 --> 00:16:17,239
too bad about K you know I I I've always

385
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:19,159
liked Kay I still like Kay he still

386
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:21,159
won't talk to me over the tpin you know

387
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:23,919
it was Kay that called me and he said

388
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:25,958
listen I have a gold nugget for you he

389
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:27,719
said he was working with shulan he was

390
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:29,439
doing the tpine extraction he had

391
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:32,480
already posted the picture of shulan

392
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:34,279
smelling the tpin that classic picture

393
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,920
and he sent me a message or called me

394
00:16:34,278 --> 00:16:37,559
actually and he said listen you need to

395
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:39,838
figure out how to get the tpin out of

396
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:41,518
the bubble water to Ste them down and

397
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:45,519
get them back into your product and I

398
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:48,039
was kind of like I was like do I like do

399
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:49,198
I need to do that but I kind of you know

400
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:50,919
like he was like listen it's really

401
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:52,639
important I just want you to to to do

402
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:54,120
this and I I did not have time to do

403
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:57,079
such a thing and was not in a position

404
00:16:54,120 --> 00:17:01,120
to do such a thing so I told literally

405
00:16:57,078 --> 00:17:03,198
two people about it told Tony and I told

406
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:06,439
Horatio and those were the two people

407
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:09,720
that brought tpin to the market and Kay

408
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:12,360
was pissed about that and I mean pissed

409
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:14,038
he he was really mad like the text he

410
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:16,958
sent me I had to delete off my phone

411
00:17:14,038 --> 00:17:19,160
because they were so harsh and uh he

412
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:21,318
told me he had a patent his patent was

413
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:23,079
for every method of tarpine extraction

414
00:17:21,318 --> 00:17:25,480
from Cannabis whatsoever it covered

415
00:17:23,078 --> 00:17:27,438
everything it was very much not like K

416
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:29,200
it just wasn't it didn't sound I've

417
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:30,798
known k for 20 years at this point in

418
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,240
time and this was the first time I ever

419
00:17:30,798 --> 00:17:34,879
had a disagreement with him let alone

420
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,519
and I send him a message probably every

421
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,160
six months saying hey bro I'm thinking

422
00:17:36,519 --> 00:17:41,879
about you he still won't message me back

423
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:43,679
over this T he was so angry that that

424
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,640
Tony was able to create a success with

425
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,080
his tpin and that herio was creating

426
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:49,480
tpin and and for me I look back and I

427
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:51,240
think well man you could have just come

428
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:54,038
out and done your tpine thing I haven't

429
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:56,400
seen him do anything in regards the tpin

430
00:17:54,038 --> 00:17:58,440
since 2014 and it was like it was a

431
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,640
fairly important you know was as

432
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:02,519
important as it was for Sam to do what

433
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,720
he did with the very few of us that got

434
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:06,918
to learn the modulating effects of tpin

435
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,400
back in early 2000s in his apartment in

436
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:11,080
Amsterdam because that was of course you

437
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,240
can always trace it back to Sam and

438
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:15,839
Sam's not the one crying that everyone

439
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:19,279
took this idea from him but it's always

440
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:21,079
seems to be it always seems to be Sam

441
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:23,038
right 2000 I think he hit me with the

442
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:25,279
pure cannaboids and the pure tpin I had

443
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:28,000
never seen anything like it but it was

444
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:29,720
really Tony and Horatio who made it

445
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,679
available to the public they were

446
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:34,360
suddenly now able to have these cannabis

447
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:36,240
drive tpin hold them in their hands see

448
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:39,359
them feel them smell them touch them

449
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:42,279
consume them dab them and uh that was a

450
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:44,199
big deal and it's it is unfortunate that

451
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:46,440
sometimes we end up in these clashes and

452
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:48,720
I know you know Horatio was never in a

453
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:50,400
position where he was you know making so

454
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,839
much money that he was just very

455
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,759
confident and secure so for Kay to have

456
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:57,519
laid that on him that he was gonna GNA

457
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:59,359
sue him that weighed on Horatio like a

458
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:01,200
great deal I had

459
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:03,158
I had conversations with him about that

460
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,120
you know where it was like listen I had

461
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:07,799
already gone through like a six-year

462
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:09,639
lawsuit with Reinhardt so I was like all

463
00:19:07,798 --> 00:19:11,918
right K like Bring It On You Wanna you

464
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:14,360
want to do lawsuits like I I I know how

465
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:16,840
to do lawsuits and uh that's another you

466
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:18,199
know two more uh well Reinhardt was

467
00:19:16,839 --> 00:19:19,839
never on hash church but he was

468
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:22,159
certainly a giant part of the hash

469
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:24,279
community and the and the hash world

470
00:19:22,159 --> 00:19:26,360
because he created that machine and that

471
00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:30,000
machine was exactly where the bags were

472
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:32,479
created from rip to Elden who was uh the

473
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,640
gentleman who came up with the bag idea

474
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,679
uh rip to Reinhardt who passed away at

475
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,520
the end of 2018 or the end of 2017 right

476
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:41,798
when his patent expired if you if you

477
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:45,240
can imagine Reinhardt passed away as his

478
00:19:41,798 --> 00:19:47,400
water extraction uh pass uh patent also

479
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:49,440
perished and I also want to give a shout

480
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:51,559
out to Dr Lester grinspoon who was also

481
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,519
a hash Church alumni made it on here for

482
00:19:51,558 --> 00:19:56,639
a couple of episodes uh and obviously

483
00:19:54,519 --> 00:20:00,440
lived an incredible life it was not

484
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:02,799
quite the same um sad story that it was

485
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:05,558
with uh Horatio dying at such a young

486
00:20:02,798 --> 00:20:08,679
age I'm sure Lester was more than twice

487
00:20:05,558 --> 00:20:10,599
Horatio's age um when he passed away so

488
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:13,159
he lived this incredible life he lived a

489
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:15,158
long life a fruitful life and one that

490
00:20:13,159 --> 00:20:18,080
also affected the Canabis industry in a

491
00:20:15,159 --> 00:20:19,720
very very deep and meaningful way so we

492
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:22,599
just want to shout out all the Lost

493
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:24,759
brothers and sisters uh over the years

494
00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:26,918
uh and just let them know that we're

495
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:30,679
thinking of them and uh regardless of

496
00:20:26,919 --> 00:20:32,480
whether we had uh you know falling outs

497
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:34,080
or that we maintain these friendships

498
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,640
you know you still can be a big enough

499
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:39,319
person to uh show respect for these

500
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:41,720
people and I'll I'll say you know I have

501
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:44,119
nothing but respect for Kenny Morrow uh

502
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:46,839
K from Tricom Technologies I hope to one

503
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:48,279
day be his friend again I I personally

504
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:50,678
have never stopped being his friend but

505
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:52,119
that tpine thing really really bit him

506
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:53,919
the wrong way and it's uh it's

507
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:56,239
unfortunate but it is something that

508
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:58,799
happens in our industry uh quite often

509
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:01,159
and we'll have to uh learn how to to

510
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:02,879
mature out of these experiences and and

511
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:05,120
bring things back full circle because

512
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:08,440
it's easy to burn bridges down it's a

513
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:12,038
lot harder to to rebuild them hey I want

514
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:15,840
to shout out to Dr Lester grinspoon you

515
00:21:12,038 --> 00:21:18,640
know I was the pts study in uh marijuana

516
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:21,278
The Forbidden medicine and uh you know

517
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:24,679
he touched my life back after the war

518
00:21:21,278 --> 00:21:26,599
and was uh willing to put forward we all

519
00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:29,200
published anonymously but I am thanked

520
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:32,519
in the forward um

521
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,519
but that was one of my

522
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:37,879
early to

523
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,400
self-healing uh was to actually you know

524
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,960
write down my story I'd gone around and

525
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,440
told it for a few years going around

526
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,679
being an activist with canvas action

527
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:48,120
nwork I was fortunate to do Ries in 47

528
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,519
States you know got kicked out of Canada

529
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:53,558
with our legal marijuana from Elie

530
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:55,798
musika but um Dr grinspoon was a force

531
00:21:53,558 --> 00:21:58,639
and you know he suffered the slings and

532
00:21:55,798 --> 00:22:01,519
arrows uh for the things that he

533
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:04,440
published and took a lot of heat for it

534
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:06,639
as a Pioneer and as I look around at a

535
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:08,480
whole bunch of other Pioneers here we

536
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:11,799
all know unfortunately

537
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:13,919
the painful piercings that can happen

538
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:18,000
when you tread where nobody else's tread

539
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:21,230
and tried and um Dr grinspoon definitely

540
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,240
deserves an honor

541
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:27,319
[Music]

542
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:29,919
inall in the darkest of Ages and pushed

543
00:22:27,319 --> 00:22:33,119
forward with his life all of us to see

544
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:37,159
and giving me a shoulder to stand on uh

545
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:38,798
needless to say was beyond humbling um I

546
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:40,640
kind of want to give a shout out to

547
00:22:38,798 --> 00:22:42,079
because I've been doing my own uh

548
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,600
veteran healing shout out to the

549
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:46,960

Pearson and uh veterans virtual happy

551

hour Jose and them on Fridays they've

552
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:54,360
been keeping me staining during this

553
00:22:51,278 --> 00:22:56,319
covid stuff so um we're working actually

554
00:22:54,359 --> 00:22:58,558
behind the scenes we have some really

555
00:22:56,319 --> 00:23:00,918
cool stuff happening did you all know

556
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:02,798
that the compassionate indd program or

557
00:23:00,919 --> 00:23:05,038
at least the investigative new drug

558
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:08,798
program was reopened by the United

559
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:08,798
States government due to epid

560
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:14,918
dialects oh yeah and uh so what we're

561
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:18,079
gonna try to do is we're gonna try to uh

562
00:23:14,919 --> 00:23:22,000
re access and uh take veterans through

563
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:24,519
that and get uh access again be it most

564
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,159
likely from importation as opposed to

565
00:23:24,519 --> 00:23:30,558
getting that crappy Mississippi weed but

566
00:23:27,159 --> 00:23:34,559
um yeah look out we're coming out as a

567
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:38,720
force yes sir the epilex is made out of

568
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:41,399
a CBD variety I developed a licens to

569
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,558
GW I know you did because you're the

570
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:46,159
master and thank you very much for what

571
00:23:43,558 --> 00:23:50,678
you did because uh I have not tried

572
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:53,240
epidex but at the same time its creation

573
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:57,679
uh and due to set of x's failure allowed

574
00:23:53,240 --> 00:24:00,038
the indd program to reopen so um that's

575
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:02,159
huge for patients who want access to

576
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:06,519
investigative new drugs because it was

577
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:08,240
shut down in the early 90s due to U A A

578
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:10,278
A Congress person basically saying

579
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:14,240
because a bunch of AIDS patient were

580
00:24:10,278 --> 00:24:16,200
signing up that people were trying to uh

581
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,759
you know get access to the program so

582
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,400
they could spread AIDS around the world

583
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:21,960
so they think they have the access to

584
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:24,840
marijuana and so they shut down the

585
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:27,759
program Robert Randall helped arrange

586
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:30,839
for the AIDS patients to make those

587
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:32,359
applications for the program and for

588
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:34,599
those who don't know Robert Randall was

589
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:37,798
the first person to win the right to

590
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:39,558
have access to Medical uh cannabis from

591
00:24:37,798 --> 00:24:43,200
the United States government grown at

592
00:24:39,558 --> 00:24:46,440
the University of Mississippi in Oxford

593
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:48,159
so do alol and them are still at it but

594
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:50,558
uh maybe through this program we can get

595
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:52,679
them to grow some good weed finally by

596
00:24:50,558 --> 00:24:54,240
get importing from either Israel or some

597
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:56,159
of these other countries that'll force

598
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,679
them even Canadian weed which would be

599
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:01,120
able to import for the com combas

600
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:04,080
program speaking of which would you

601
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:05,678
recommend as an access from of your

602
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:10,119
Canadian weed what would you recommend

603
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:13,159
to us American veterans companies Etc we

604
00:25:10,119 --> 00:25:16,239
would recommend regenerative hemp that

605
00:25:13,159 --> 00:25:18,240
or or or cannabis grown organically

606
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:22,000
because we find that the chemicals that

607
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:24,519
are often used in The Grow can affect

608
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:28,079
you know the Mind space of the medicine

609
00:25:24,519 --> 00:25:30,359
afterwards so especially with uh you

610
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:33,199
know know you know people from the

611
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:35,759
military and stuff and there there are

612
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:38,038
more people in our area in the cies that

613
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:39,798
have been licensed recently that could

614
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:41,960
provide you with some of that medicine

615
00:25:39,798 --> 00:25:44,519
which is I'm going to say somewhat new I

616
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:46,480
mean you know the the licensed producer

617
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:49,480
program here in Canada has not been set

618
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:52,319
up to really produce like you know let's

619
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:54,558
say intentional medicine and whatnot so

620
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:56,359
you know I would love to to hook you up

621
00:25:54,558 --> 00:25:58,440
with a couple of people in our area and

622
00:25:56,359 --> 00:26:00,959
see if it would work out some of the

623
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:02,679
problems in Canada with Organics as well

624
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,079
just like it's the same problem in

625
00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:06,798
California and the selenis valley is

626
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:09,319
that trying to grow organically while

627
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:11,720
everyone else is bombing Avid and

628
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:14,038
malathion on their avocados and their

629
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:17,278
raspberries and blueberries makes it

630
00:26:14,038 --> 00:26:18,798
damn near impossible to grow organically

631
00:26:17,278 --> 00:26:21,880
you you really have to make sure you

632
00:26:18,798 --> 00:26:23,960
choose your farm position wisely and

633
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:26,399
also potentially hope to control your

634
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:28,600
neighbors Farms if they're uh being

635
00:26:26,398 --> 00:26:30,398
farmed or if they're being sold to

636
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:32,759
people coming in to with the intention

637
00:26:30,398 --> 00:26:36,079
of farming because the amount of people

638
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:40,440
who grow um conventionally which is the

639
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:42,240
word they use for poison um is just

640
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:44,080
astronomical it is absolutely

641
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,000
astronomical how many people and so

642
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:50,558
we've seen this we've seen organic

643
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:52,480
cannabis fail um pesticides and just and

644
00:26:50,558 --> 00:26:54,720
without ever having sprayed a single

645
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,240
pesticide on the plant so that's that's

646
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,319
kind of disconcerting when you think of

647
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:01,558
the energy and the time and the and what

648
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:03,639
it takes to do it in in the right way

649
00:27:01,558 --> 00:27:06,200
also with health Canada not really

650
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:08,000
allowing uh kind of like the US was

651
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:10,360
there where microbial counts you were

652
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,359
failing in microbial counts uh and they

653
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:15,240
weren't necessarily the microbes that

654
00:27:12,359 --> 00:27:18,119
were the negative microbes so these

655
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:19,798
things have a long way to go I think I

656
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:21,798
you know like obviously in health

657
00:27:19,798 --> 00:27:23,679
Canada's um programs you're not allowed

658
00:27:21,798 --> 00:27:25,879
to have this sort of full closed loop

659
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:27,840
like have goats [ __ ] over there and

660
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:29,960
have like you know your compost like

661
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:32,158
it's very very structured and very

662
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:33,519
controlled and hopefully you know people

663
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:35,720
like Josh and Kelly can have an

664
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:37,359
influence and that more and more people

665
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:39,839
I I think the way to talk to these

666
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:42,119
people is through the words terar and

667
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:44,398
Appalachia and understand that we can't

668
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:46,639
scrub those things out of cannabis the

669
00:27:44,398 --> 00:27:48,038
way we haven't scrubbed them out of the

670
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:50,640
wine industry and out of the grape

671
00:27:48,038 --> 00:27:52,319
industry if you ever considered uh uh

672
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:55,320
offering that to the wine industry hey

673
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:57,558
let's scrub the Terre out grow in

674
00:27:55,319 --> 00:28:00,278
aseptic rooms with lights and and

675
00:27:57,558 --> 00:28:02,558
nutrients salt nutrients and let's see

676
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:04,839
what kind of uh what kind of wine we get

677
00:28:02,558 --> 00:28:06,558
out of that I think that Community would

678
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:08,079
be like in an uproar and say well you

679
00:28:06,558 --> 00:28:10,519
can't do that that's like the most

680
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:12,839
important thing when we grow our grapes

681
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:15,519
next to the genetics themselves is the

682
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:18,158
terroir in which we grow and so if the

683
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:19,880
Canadian cannabis program Health Canada

684
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:23,039
can start understanding the value of

685
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:26,360
Terr and how it applies to cannabis we

686
00:28:23,038 --> 00:28:28,319
may very well get to that place that uh

687
00:28:26,359 --> 00:28:30,558
that you're already at Josh there are

688
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:33,678
two different crops though Marcus

689
00:28:30,558 --> 00:28:37,798
because uh grapes are grown in Native

690
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:40,600
Earth yes cannabis very little cannabis

691
00:28:37,798 --> 00:28:43,720
grown Outdoors is actually grown in

692
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:48,038
Native earth almost all of it is in bags

693
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:49,880
or manmade soil yes yes that's true too

694
00:28:48,038 --> 00:28:52,440
so in the case of in the case of the

695
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:55,159
regenerative farmers

696
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:57,480
and and even some of the licensed two of

697
00:28:55,159 --> 00:29:00,399
the licensed farmers in our area they

698
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:04,759
are growing in native soil and they are

699
00:29:00,398 --> 00:29:08,518
growing outdoor varietals and with the

700
00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:10,119
help of some of the genetic uh research

701
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:12,679
going on with like Daryl Hudson and

702
00:29:10,119 --> 00:29:16,000
implanta and all that there's um hemp

703
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:18,720
that's being you know tested still um

704
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,919
outdoors and whatnot that can finish out

705
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,679
here because as we've stated before

706
00:29:20,919 --> 00:29:24,559
Kelly and I have personally grown out a

707
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:26,360
lot of the hemp Vari almost all of the

708
00:29:24,558 --> 00:29:29,319
hemp varietals I mean you can't say all

709
00:29:26,359 --> 00:29:31,479
but a shitload of them have we've tried

710
00:29:29,319 --> 00:29:33,678
to grow them Outdoors out here and it's

711
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:35,159
they just don't come they just don't

712
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:38,038
finish and they don't have the same

713
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:40,120
flavor or the same profiles so getting

714
00:29:38,038 --> 00:29:42,158
an outdoor varietal that works out here

715
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:46,839
that's also registered in the Canadian

716
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:49,200
hemp um uh bracket is is is is still in

717
00:29:46,839 --> 00:29:52,240
process and let's say since the licensed

718
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:56,120
producers here in

719
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:57,558
Canada have somewhat had a failed run

720
00:29:56,119 --> 00:29:59,959
you know and the Cana and the Canadian

721
00:29:57,558 --> 00:30:02,079
government is seeing you know how how

722
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:04,798
this isn't working they there's change

723
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:06,079
coming to our community and and and uh

724
00:30:04,798 --> 00:30:07,960
you know there's people that are are

725
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:10,480
looking at making changes and maybe ATN

726
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:12,759
or something you can like talk to some

727
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:15,000
to the Canadian people about like what

728
00:30:12,759 --> 00:30:17,038
California's done with microbials and

729
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,919
California only tests for human

730
00:30:17,038 --> 00:30:23,319
pathogens if I'm correct um which are

731
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:25,799
you know like eoli and botul is it

732
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:28,200
botulism and leria I you could maybe

733
00:30:25,798 --> 00:30:31,720
name off all of them but uh and I think

734
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:33,840
you know using human pathogens as a as a

735
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:35,798
you know um something to test for and

736
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:39,038
heavy metals that kind of makes sense to

737
00:30:35,798 --> 00:30:42,839
me um I have a

738
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:45,240
question because of soil not everybody

739
00:30:42,839 --> 00:30:47,398
can prep their soil properly okay which

740
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:50,720
is true right and I have veterans and a

741
00:30:47,398 --> 00:30:52,398
lot of people ask me God what's the best

742
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:55,000
over-the-counter

743
00:30:52,398 --> 00:30:57,518
soil that's on the market that you would

744
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:00,519
recommend for cannabis Growers that

745
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:02,399
don't have access to do what you

746
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:04,638
beautiful people do up at dragonfly and

747
00:31:02,398 --> 00:31:06,398
others that actually prep their soil

748
00:31:04,638 --> 00:31:08,719
what would you recommend as an

749
00:31:06,398 --> 00:31:11,119
over-the-counter soil that you could add

750
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,120
to

751
00:31:12,798 --> 00:31:18,918
Etc um I

752
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:20,839
mean go ahead I like I like builda soil

753
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:23,919
a lot I think they have a lot of options

754
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:27,158
for for the the hom grower U they also

755
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:28,559
offer some some cover crop um solutions

756
00:31:27,159 --> 00:31:30,760
for you

757
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:32,839
um you know I think that's a good way to

758
00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:35,038
start and then there's also super soil

759
00:31:32,839 --> 00:31:38,038
recipes online that you can easily look

760
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:40,240
up um and mix and match your favorite

761
00:31:38,038 --> 00:31:42,398
amendments from you know such as you

762
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,839
know the Dem pure offerings that you

763
00:31:42,398 --> 00:31:47,359
have you can mix your own soils pretty

764
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:49,119
easily um and it doesn't really require

765
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:51,719
much space to do something like that if

766
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:53,959
you're doing you know a small grow for

767
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:56,600
yourself and i' I'd highly recommend

768
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:59,200
that um for anyone out there to to

769
00:31:56,599 --> 00:32:02,678
really get into the soil biology and

770
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:06,240
biome of of what you're doing um so and

771
00:32:02,679 --> 00:32:09,080
I I wanted to interject on what Josh was

772
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:11,240
saying about growing at scale with with

773
00:32:09,079 --> 00:32:13,319
you know regenerative practices in

774
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:16,638
Upstate New York there's a 2600 Acre

775
00:32:13,319 --> 00:32:20,038
Farm that is rotational of with 30 acres

776
00:32:16,638 --> 00:32:22,918
of hemp on it and all we do on that farm

777
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:25,798
is is grow regeneratively using cover

778
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:29,480
crop and then we we you know we it's in

779
00:32:25,798 --> 00:32:32,000
a rotation uh with other crops so it's

780
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:33,200
it's very much on a schedule much like a

781
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,398
you know conventional farm would

782
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,519
actually run their schedules however the

783
00:32:35,398 --> 00:32:40,239
inputs are actually forged from the land

784
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:43,240
itself also doing carbon sequestering

785
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:44,919
and and things of that nature so I think

786
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:47,319
what I've seen over that time working

787
00:32:44,919 --> 00:32:49,559
with that project I've seen you know a

788
00:32:47,319 --> 00:32:52,918
lot of trials and tribulations but I now

789
00:32:49,558 --> 00:32:55,638
feel you know it's really it's PL

790
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:57,480
plausible to do this large scale and I

791
00:32:55,638 --> 00:32:59,359
do believe that that is something that

792
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:01,319
we can all look

793
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:02,918
towards I was just sitting here talking

794
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:07,798
about all the organic growing and stuff

795
00:33:02,919 --> 00:33:09,720
like that I remember when uh Rao he um

796
00:33:07,798 --> 00:33:11,679
started baking all the compost piles and

797
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:13,440
stuff like that and adding all the

798
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:14,880
chicken [ __ ] to and stuff like that and

799
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,038
he had like I'm at his house right now

800
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:19,000
and he's got all big cement mixers and

801
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:20,440
and you should see all the piles of they

802
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,319
have all the organic Growers there and

803
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:23,399
stuff like that and all his beds that he

804
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:24,960
put out there because they're growing

805
00:33:23,398 --> 00:33:27,119
all their own food and stuff like that

806
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,840
and he he really got really into what

807
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:30,000
you guys are talking about but he always

808
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:31,480
tried to do it a little different he

809
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,480
always tried to do it his way he always

810
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:36,759
tried to kind of reinvent the wheel in

811
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:39,038
some way and stuff like that um I'm just

812
00:33:36,759 --> 00:33:41,359
seeing all these piles of um near the

813
00:33:39,038 --> 00:33:43,200
hen right now and he's got all this

814
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:45,240
tarps over it and he's he's he's getting

815
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,960
all this dirt ready for for spring for

816
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:48,240
next year and stuff like that and I

817
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,840
think I'm G to go there and grab a bunch

818
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,960
of that actually and pile it back in my

819
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:53,359
truck and bring it to my house today um

820
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:55,319
because I know he worked a lot on that

821
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:56,479
and that's my first of my living soils

822
00:33:55,319 --> 00:33:59,480
that I'm going to start thank keep

823
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:02,319
talking about it

824
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:06,200
yeah grow some grow some urban htio grow

825
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:08,199
some Urban Horatio's uh soil I am I'm

826
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,760
totally going to do that I I I I can see

827
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:11,759
it there as you're talking about it and

828
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:13,879
thank you for talking about that because

829
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,839
I just forgot about what he was doing

830
00:34:13,878 --> 00:34:17,199
there and and then now seeing it there

831
00:34:15,838 --> 00:34:19,239
I'm sorry I'm a little tear out about of

832
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:21,638
course because he was a good friend um

833
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:24,638
but uh that's it was it's pretty awesome

834
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:26,119
to see just the what what we always put

835
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:28,000
and he was always saying the turps we

836
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:29,240
got to get those turps going he was

837
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,760
always about the turps and he knew that

838
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:32,799
the generative way was how they going to

839
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:34,320
get the best TPS and and and then he

840
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,800
went into hydro and and I'm going

841
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,599
through all this Hydro Gear right now

842
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:39,839
and I mean he literally tried

843
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:42,320
Reinventing growing guys it was like

844
00:34:39,838 --> 00:34:46,159
he's these Spinners and all these tubes

845
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:47,760
and discs and it was um and he was

846
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:49,519
always trying to get there and and when

847
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,040
regenerative soils come into play here

848
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:53,320
and all these living soils and stuff

849
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:55,918
like that like the flavors that we're

850
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:58,960
getting from the Cannabis is is just so

851
00:34:55,918 --> 00:35:00,838
amazing and and really it's um it's it's

852
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,559
really cool to um you know talk more

853
00:35:00,838 --> 00:35:04,119
about that about trying to get those TS

854
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:05,759
trying to look at that that whole

855
00:35:04,119 --> 00:35:07,960
natural thing and that's what Hera was

856
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:09,440
all about was was all about natural he

857
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:11,639
didn't want any chemicals in anything

858
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,200
and if he didn't an extraction that had

859
00:35:11,639 --> 00:35:14,719
anything that was sprayed on it he would

860
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:16,519
he give it back to you like you can't

861
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:19,879
spray anything on there it had powdery

862
00:35:16,519 --> 00:35:22,880
Milo so it's not working and it it was

863
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:24,440
um he was always chasing that and and

864
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,680
and I saw the soils as you're talking

865
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:28,079
about that and that's how we really got

866
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:30,639
to give back is by growing and getting

867
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:33,880
those turps and and and living what you

868
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:35,920
love to do right well I'll tell you we

869
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:38,880
have it all on record you know like

870
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:40,599
there's a lot of Horatio recordings on

871
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,280
hash church and in fact there's a lot of

872
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:44,680
all of you guys on hash Church we're all

873
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:47,200
going to have meet our maker one day and

874
00:35:44,679 --> 00:35:49,239
pass on and we'll all have done a ton of

875
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:51,519
different things but the amount of time

876
00:35:49,239 --> 00:35:54,799
and energy and talking and sharing that

877
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:57,719
you guys have done here on this platform

878
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:59,640
uh will sh will and should live on for a

879
00:35:57,719 --> 00:36:01,919
very long time I have them all backed up

880
00:35:59,639 --> 00:36:04,400
I've removed them all and you know

881
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:07,039
copied them all off of uh YouTube so

882
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:09,400
they're secure on multiple hard drives I

883
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:12,440
think of it as very very Priceless

884
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:15,480
information that I never ever plan to

885
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:18,039
monetize but always plan to share and

886
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:19,639
give away and and make sure that you

887
00:36:18,039 --> 00:36:21,239
know what a great thing like Mark said

888
00:36:19,639 --> 00:36:24,480
you can go back and you can watch

889
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:27,159
literally hours and hours and hours I

890
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:30,159
think there's probably half a dozen to

891
00:36:27,159 --> 00:36:32,838
10 videos with just myself and Horatio

892
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:34,519
maybe Johnny B as well but then however

893
00:36:32,838 --> 00:36:38,159
many hash churches I don't know if he

894
00:36:34,519 --> 00:36:40,239
was on a hundred or 150 or how many hash

895
00:36:38,159 --> 00:36:42,559
churches he was on but he was definitely

896
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:45,879
on more than a

897
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:48,358
few freshly Frozen taking over the show

898
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:50,599
now I I don't know what happened I was I

899
00:36:48,358 --> 00:36:54,199
was saying good things

900
00:36:50,599 --> 00:36:57,119
there you was profound we were all

901
00:36:54,199 --> 00:36:59,199
wrapped oh [ __ ] Hero's playing games

902
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:02,480
with us

903
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:05,838
you know that's good you know I would

904
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:07,318
just um add or go ahead if you want to

905
00:37:05,838 --> 00:37:10,880
say

906
00:37:07,318 --> 00:37:12,318
something Hora is shining his love down

907
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:15,440
on us right

908
00:37:12,318 --> 00:37:17,440
now um I would add to what was said

909
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,720
about all the soils saying that I agree

910
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,559
with every that's said there and it's

911
00:37:19,719 --> 00:37:24,118
beautiful that Johnny's being able to

912
00:37:21,559 --> 00:37:25,639
connect with you know Horatio through

913
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:28,280
the soil and through the turps and

914
00:37:25,639 --> 00:37:31,118
everything and you know there's there's

915
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:32,880
buying there's buying soil you know um

916
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:34,480
on you know line or getting it in bags

917
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,559
and that can be done and then you know

918
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,880
people will use teas on top of that to

919
00:37:36,559 --> 00:37:42,799
make it really work and a lot of people

920
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:44,519
will shoot for the a a big bud kind of

921
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,079
like you know like the the the

922
00:37:44,519 --> 00:37:48,880
bodybuilder or whatever they go for the

923
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:51,920
big bud rather than the actual depth of

924
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:54,640
the soil and the and the flavor and the

925
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:57,519
chps so what I'm going to say is it's

926
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:59,159
really important to make your own soil

927
00:37:57,519 --> 00:38:01,480
so I think it's great calling that you

928
00:37:59,159 --> 00:38:03,480
that you brought a builda soil and

929
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:06,240
making your own soil so when you make

930
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:07,719
your own soil and even you know veterans

931
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:09,719
or people that have a small amount of

932
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:11,919
space I think it's really important to

933
00:38:09,719 --> 00:38:16,000
to look at the the components of your

934
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:18,079
soil and what the act of mixing all that

935
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,159
and make and getting microbes living

936
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:23,079
microbes and putting that together is a

937
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:24,838
healing process in itself and then you

938
00:38:23,079 --> 00:38:26,760
start getting your seed together you

939
00:38:24,838 --> 00:38:28,960
start thinking and connecting with the

940
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:30,640
soil and and then the seed and you put

941
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:33,119
the seed in there or a clone and then

942
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:35,318
you put that in there because I mean

943
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:37,000
growing isn't an automatic thing it's

944
00:38:35,318 --> 00:38:38,920
something that really is a spiritual

945
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:42,318
connection so making your own soil is

946
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:45,519
really the first part of that and buying

947
00:38:42,318 --> 00:38:50,279
dust and powers and stuff from from

948
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:52,759
stores is only so alive so I would say

949
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:55,119
going out on a walk and and I want to

950
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:58,200
make this really clear is and and

951
00:38:55,119 --> 00:39:01,000
selectively grabbing some and inoculant

952
00:38:58,199 --> 00:39:02,559
from nature you know whether it's and I

953
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,679
realize some people don't live near

954
00:39:02,559 --> 00:39:06,358
nature so I'm I'm I'm in full awareness

955
00:39:04,679 --> 00:39:08,639
that you know not everyone can do this

956
00:39:06,358 --> 00:39:11,759
so you know but the for the people that

957
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:15,039
can you can grab like a small little

958
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:17,839
handful and put it in a bag a small bag

959
00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:20,358
of leaf stff and leaf matter and that's

960
00:39:17,838 --> 00:39:23,078
your living organisms and the living

961
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:25,000
organisms really need something to

962
00:39:23,079 --> 00:39:28,079
continue living so adding a little bit

963
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:30,559
of mulch to that gives it something to

964
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:34,560
continue living on so the interaction

965
00:39:30,559 --> 00:39:37,880
between raw materials and soil is the

966
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:40,838
living part so you you a person doesn't

967
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:43,160
have living soils by buying a bunch of

968
00:39:40,838 --> 00:39:46,719
amendments and mixing them together and

969
00:39:43,159 --> 00:39:48,598
them being called biological they're

970
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:51,719
they're biological and they're alive

971
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:55,559
when they're eating something so top

972
00:39:51,719 --> 00:39:58,759
dressing you know nettle powder or

973
00:39:55,559 --> 00:40:01,078
alphalpha powder or you know whatever

974
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:03,079
you can get ganja Leaf any of your

975
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:04,920
defoliating leaves that are healthy you

976
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:06,839
could dry out or you could just drop

977
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:08,599
them right on your soil and that feeds

978
00:40:06,838 --> 00:40:11,920
the top layer we know the top layer of

979
00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:13,480
soil is the most active so you want

980
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:16,480
layer of soil once you get your soil

981
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:19,039
based so that's where the depth of tping

982
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:22,039
come from that's where the plant is able

983
00:40:19,039 --> 00:40:24,639
to express itself we know the plant is

984
00:40:22,039 --> 00:40:26,639
expressing itself and and Mark can and

985
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:27,960
different people can talk about the

986
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:30,440
science behind

987
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:33,440
how a plant is able to be different in

988
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:37,440
an aeroponic situation or a hydroponic

989
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:40,559
or a fully biological rich soil

990
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:42,920
so there's a lot of you know lot of

991
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:45,960
people nowadays moving towards you know

992
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:49,318
using these soils in a production way

993
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:50,880
and also in a backyard way and um you

994
00:40:49,318 --> 00:40:53,679
know and I just want to really encourage

995
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:55,519
people to continue with it because it's

996
00:40:53,679 --> 00:40:58,318
it's the future and it's how we're going

997
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:59,838
to make it into the future and it's how

998
00:40:58,318 --> 00:41:02,480
we you know are going to be able to

999
00:40:59,838 --> 00:41:04,719
connect with longevity and Longevity is

1000
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:05,800
missing right now in our lives in many

1001
00:41:04,719 --> 00:41:08,519
different

1002
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:11,640
areas I would add I would add to that

1003
00:41:08,519 --> 00:41:13,719
joshing your own soil is really really

1004
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:16,078
important I would I would add to that

1005
00:41:13,719 --> 00:41:18,439
that if you want a great book for

1006
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:22,480
learning all of this that's really fun

1007
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:25,159
and easy to to to read this comic book

1008
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:27,960
is like Second To None it blew me away

1009
00:41:25,159 --> 00:41:30,639
grow organic it starts with this Dutch

1010
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:32,880
guy and he's growing uh he's growing

1011
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:35,039
with salts and chemicals and he's

1012
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:37,039
looking on the labels and he's like what

1013

stuff can kill you and so he tosses it

1015
00:41:39,519 --> 00:41:43,838
all away and he starts learning about

1016
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:46,640
Organics and he basically go they go

1017
00:41:43,838 --> 00:41:48,880

takes you through like this beautiful

1019
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:53,599
visuals of what's going on in the plant

in in communication with those two and I

1043
00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:55,599
believe France when they were creating

1044
00:42:53,719 --> 00:42:59,679
it yeah it's an awesome book totally

1045
00:42:55,599 --> 00:43:02,160
agree it's a definitely France kid yeah

1046
00:42:59,679 --> 00:43:04,639
kids book made you know for you know

1047
00:43:02,159 --> 00:43:08,239
everyone also rodale's guide to compost

1048
00:43:04,639 --> 00:43:11,519
is a really good base from the 40s till

1049
00:43:08,239 --> 00:43:13,239
now you know that and they continue to

1050
00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:15,039
bring information about regenerative

1051
00:43:13,239 --> 00:43:18,439
farming another another thing to look

1052
00:43:15,039 --> 00:43:21,719
into is in your local community is a

1053
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:25,079
municipal compost and Municipal dirt

1054
00:43:21,719 --> 00:43:26,759
that's being made in your area the the

1055
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:28,760
issue you might run across and you can

1056
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:32,160
ask them for testing is if there's any

1057
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:34,160
roadside sprays or any vegetation that's

1058
00:43:32,159 --> 00:43:36,318
been used from say golf courses or

1059
00:43:34,159 --> 00:43:41,078
something that can contaminate the soil

1060
00:43:36,318 --> 00:43:45,440
so maybe before you use a local M

1061
00:43:41,079 --> 00:43:47,800
Municipal compost hi Alice um before you

1062
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:50,960
use the municipal compost maybe ask them

1063
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:54,599
if they have testing for uh fertilizer

1064
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:57,519
residuals or um uh herbicides or

1065
00:43:54,599 --> 00:43:59,440
fungicides um so Municipal comp post is

1066
00:43:57,519 --> 00:44:02,639
also kind of like if when it's good it's

1067
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:05,559
it's a local soil that has organisms

1068
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:08,679
from your local area and we could go on

1069
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:10,119
and on about soil but blessings Alice

1070
00:44:08,679 --> 00:44:12,239
how are you today are you how you

1071

1089
00:44:55,639 --> 00:44:59,279
bit about the fires today as as well and

1090
00:44:57,559 --> 00:45:01,599
how that's affecting everyone down along

1091
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:03,359
the west coast and how we can kind of

1092
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:05,960
Point people in the direction of the

1093
00:45:03,358 --> 00:45:08,639
right uh the right ways to offer help

1094
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:10,519
you know I seen uh I'm on an email chain

1095
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:12,199
with Josh and Kelly from dragonfly Earth

1096
00:45:10,519 --> 00:45:14,400
medicine you may very well be on it as

1097
00:45:12,199 --> 00:45:16,679
well Alice I I I don't look at the names

1098
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:18,680
but uh yeah it was nice to see all these

1099
00:45:16,679 --> 00:45:21,279
people just offering help and you know

1100
00:45:18,679 --> 00:45:23,199
like whatever it is no matter how small

1101
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:24,920
it's offered and it's like look this is

1102
00:45:23,199 --> 00:45:27,838
what I can offer and this is what I will

1103
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:29,480
offer so that makes you feel good when

1104
00:45:27,838 --> 00:45:31,679
uh it's not you know people using each

1105
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:33,159
other as ladders to climb on top of one

1106
00:45:31,679 --> 00:45:35,000
another to get to the top but they're

1107
00:45:33,159 --> 00:45:37,399
actually like helping each other and

1108
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,000
putting a hand down to to lift someone

1109
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:41,680
up so that's that's the kind of

1110
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:45,079
communities I want to be involved

1111
00:45:41,679 --> 00:45:48,159
with yeah and during this time of

1112
00:45:45,079 --> 00:45:51,079
political turmoil and environmental

1113
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:53,799
turmoil there's just a lot of divisive

1114
00:45:51,079 --> 00:45:55,440
potential out there you know who's going

1115
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:57,800
where you know which direction and

1116
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:59,480
everything and and even the Cannabis

1117
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:01,880
space you know we've talked about it

1118
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:02,960
it's it can be com a competitive space

1119
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:05,200
because people are trying to make it

1120
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:06,480
work with ideas and all that but you

1121
00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:09,960
know what we've

1122
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:12,800
really done within our community is just

1123
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:14,838
really bring in the supportive aspect

1124
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:17,640
and realize that us all coming up

1125
00:46:14,838 --> 00:46:19,558
together is a success and part of the

1126
00:46:17,639 --> 00:46:23,318
success is just supporting each other so

1127
00:46:19,559 --> 00:46:26,440
during this fire situation I mean it's

1128
00:46:23,318 --> 00:46:29,480
been a a long like almost a month now of

1129
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:32,519
problems with fires in Oregon and in

1130
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:34,639
California and some people have been

1131
00:46:32,519 --> 00:46:37,440
awoken at night not knowing there was a

1132
00:46:34,639 --> 00:46:39,400
fire like the ones in Oregon recently

1133
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:41,318
and and definitely California too but

area and they were flowering out and

1161
00:47:39,079 --> 00:47:42,079
people went to their

1162
00:47:47,719 --> 00:47:54,399
houses to get back to him so he could

1163

and he's working on court cases right

1166
00:47:58,599 --> 00:48:03,359
now against the electri compies because

1167
00:48:01,519 --> 00:48:06,800
electricity went

1168
00:48:03,358 --> 00:48:08,078
out and then uh the F don't know what's

1169
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:11,359
right and wrong you know with

1170
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:13,599
electricity but electricity is a big

1171
00:48:11,358 --> 00:48:17,119
thing that's killing us you know when it

1172
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:20,480
comes to massive fires you know so wires

1173
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:22,920
go down and fires start and it's it's

1174
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:25,838
insane you know there's no

1175

1177
00:48:28,358 --> 00:48:33,598
managing and all that but uh so it's

1178
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:36,160
been it's been phenomenal so another

1179
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:39,160
thing is is actively at the moment in

that you know it was saved so to hear

1263

confirmation is great to hear although I

1264
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:23,760

1275
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:50,280
Smoky flavor it's terrible like it's not

1276
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:53,358
definitely funny like it's not funny but

1277
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:55,798
it is like [ __ ] like it's unbelievable I

1278
00:52:53,358 --> 00:53:01,199
just pray and I pray and I pray that

1279
00:52:55,798 --> 00:53:03,318

1280
00:53:01,199 --> 00:53:05,879
beer

1281
00:53:03,318 --> 00:53:08,679
yes people have to understand because

1282
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:11,798
the cat the plant is resonance all that

1283
00:53:08,679 --> 00:53:13,759
smoke debris sticks to the plants and

1284
00:53:11,798 --> 00:53:16,559
kind of gets into it and you can't wash

1285
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:18,240
it off so unlike fruit you know yeah but

1286
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:19,839
I I think they could just turn it into

1287
00:53:18,239 --> 00:53:21,679
distillate right because they could they

1288
00:53:19,838 --> 00:53:23,199
could clean up distillates so yeah

1289
00:53:21,679 --> 00:53:26,159
that's what they have to do Mark that's

1290
00:53:23,199 --> 00:53:28,480
the only thing only option you know yeah

1291
00:53:26,159 --> 00:53:29,838
a lot you know and it's nice to have an

1292
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:33,199
option but a lot of those people are

1293
00:53:29,838 --> 00:53:35,440
grow you know it's they're they're all

1294
00:53:33,199 --> 00:53:37,078
organic Growers on in the thing they're

1295
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:39,280
like oh sweet I just made an isolate

1296
00:53:37,079 --> 00:53:42,119
it's like it's not really very

1297
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:44,640
successful in that sense you know but

1298
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:46,720
yeah from the farmer point of view I

1299
00:53:44,639 --> 00:53:50,159
know go Ahad Farmers yeah from the

1300
00:53:46,719 --> 00:53:52,919
farmer point of view uh turning if

1301
00:53:50,159 --> 00:53:54,598
you're business model if you will is set

1302
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:57,760
up on the idea of being able to sell

1303
00:53:54,599 --> 00:54:01,720
highend trimmed flow hours that people

1304
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:03,760
consume by smoking uh you got a price

1305
00:54:01,719 --> 00:54:05,639
point that's considerably different than

1306
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:08,319
what's usually offered for material that

1307
00:54:05,639 --> 00:54:10,639
ends up being distillate it's a really

1308
00:54:08,318 --> 00:54:13,599
significant difference in price oh yeah

1309
00:54:10,639 --> 00:54:16,199
and um and what's true about the fires

1310
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:18,480
this year is it's really kind of a

1311
00:54:16,199 --> 00:54:20,679
tragedy all across California and across

1312
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:21,519
the country actually it's kind of a to

1313
00:54:20,679 --> 00:54:25,118
me it's

1314
00:54:21,519 --> 00:54:27,000
a a like Marcus was saying hold my beer

1315
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:30,440
because more is coming

1316
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:33,239
um what happened here with fires back in

1317
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:37,960
August was early in August around the

1318
00:54:33,239 --> 00:54:41,879
8th or the 9th one night a line of

1319
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:43,960
thunderstorms blew from south to North

1320
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:46,519
along the length of California mostly

1321
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:49,199
along the coast range and there were

1322
00:54:46,519 --> 00:54:51,759
like 12,000 lightning

1323
00:54:49,199 --> 00:54:54,759
strikes at the beginning of August so

1324
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:57,359
everything was bone dry and literally

1325
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:59,079
thousands of fires started

1326
00:54:57,358 --> 00:55:03,400
most of them were clumped like I said

1327
00:54:59,079 --> 00:55:06,839
along the coast range and um I think I

1328
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:09,680
saw that uh on Cal Fire's website uh

1329
00:55:06,838 --> 00:55:13,960
this year um and this was like a week

1330
00:55:09,679 --> 00:55:17,199
ago we had 26 times the amount of

1331
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:20,559
acreage has burned so far this year and

1332
00:55:17,199 --> 00:55:22,519
really we're early in the fire season 26

1333
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:25,480
times more has burned this year than

1334
00:55:22,519 --> 00:55:27,719
burned last year A bad fire season last

1335
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:29,639
year think there I know that this is

1336
00:55:27,719 --> 00:55:31,159
overhyped in the news a lot and

1337
00:55:29,639 --> 00:55:33,000
certainly things that we should be

1338
00:55:31,159 --> 00:55:36,960
concerned about but do you think there's

1339
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:38,440
a direct correlation to climate change

1340
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:43,720
of course

1341
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:48,519
well climate change and um large areas

1342
00:55:43,719 --> 00:55:51,199
that um to be speak plainly belong to

1343
00:55:48,519 --> 00:55:53,719
either large property owners and or the

1344
00:55:51,199 --> 00:55:56,838
US government or state governments and

1345
00:55:53,719 --> 00:55:59,558
there's no funding to do any s Forest

1346
00:55:56,838 --> 00:56:04,358
management other than cutting trees for

1347
00:55:59,559 --> 00:56:07,280
lumber 60% of California is is is

1348
00:56:04,358 --> 00:56:09,960
federal Forest land on top of that we're

1349
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:12,559
also as Wade is talking there's also

1350
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:15,838
been not proper burning for decades so

1351
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:18,599
there's unfortunately a lot of fuel out

1352
00:56:15,838 --> 00:56:20,519
there on top of that sudden Oak death

1353
00:56:18,599 --> 00:56:23,200
has also caused problems throughout

1354
00:56:20,519 --> 00:56:26,318
forests because you have certain trees

1355
00:56:23,199 --> 00:56:30,439
dying in certain areas and those are dry

1356
00:56:26,318 --> 00:56:33,558
Kinder which only and there

1357
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:34,838
spotted yeah in theot I didn't mean to

1358
00:56:33,559 --> 00:56:38,000
interrup

1359
00:56:34,838 --> 00:56:40,759
there in si the pine

1360
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:43,880
beetle yeah you have the the eucalyptus

1361
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:45,960
as well that's that's uh highly highly

1362
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:50,480
flammable yeah

1363
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:52,798
so it is worse now it it is worse now

1364
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:56,000
for all the reasons you guys are saying

1365
00:56:52,798 --> 00:56:59,079
but let's be perfectly Frank and honest

1366
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:02,159
it's the natural cycle of the forest in

1367
00:56:59,079 --> 00:57:05,359
California to that lightning strike

1368
00:57:02,159 --> 00:57:07,519
burns down huge areas it takes a hundred

1369
00:57:05,358 --> 00:57:09,920
years to regenerate this has been going

1370
00:57:07,519 --> 00:57:13,679
on for thousands and thousands and

1371
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:16,240
thousands of years Manan is what stuck

1372
00:57:13,679 --> 00:57:18,759
his houses in the middle of this yes

1373
00:57:16,239 --> 00:57:18,759
exactly

1374
00:57:19,639 --> 00:57:25,000
Sam I'm a good example of that I've got

1375
00:57:22,519 --> 00:57:27,038
you know a little farm uh at a th000

1376
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:31,318
meters in the sier Nevada near Grass

1377
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:32,640
Valley Nevada City area and uh I love

1378
00:57:31,318 --> 00:57:35,558
part of why I came here is there's so

1379
00:57:32,639 --> 00:57:40,838
many beautiful trees we have huge huge

1380
00:57:35,559 --> 00:57:42,920
chestnuts and Oaks I mean we have four

1381
00:57:40,838 --> 00:57:46,880
on a 4 acre property we have Four Oaks

1382
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:49,838
that are 120 feet tall and bigger than

1383
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:53,119
our house uh they're just amazing and we

1384
00:57:49,838 --> 00:57:55,239
have am an amazing amount of acorns

1385
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:58,559
dropping this year as a matter of fact

1386
00:57:55,239 --> 00:58:01,239
but back to fires uh what we've done is

1387
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:03,839
a pretty serious effort of fire safe

1388
00:58:01,239 --> 00:58:06,239
clearing as it's called and we haven't

1389
00:58:03,838 --> 00:58:08,798
really satisfied the requirements but

1390
00:58:06,239 --> 00:58:11,159
you kind of live with this idea that as

1391
00:58:08,798 --> 00:58:15,239
Josh was saying at any

1392
00:58:11,159 --> 00:58:17,679
moment particularly on a windy night or

1393
00:58:15,239 --> 00:58:20,759
day all of a sudden there's smoke in the

1394
00:58:17,679 --> 00:58:23,639
air and you've got literally a couple of

1395
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:26,359
minutes to get your [ __ ] together and be

1396
00:58:23,639 --> 00:58:30,318
ready to leave because you might get

1397
00:58:26,358 --> 00:58:32,078
burned out and what's real about that is

1398
00:58:30,318 --> 00:58:36,279
it's actually happened to a number of

1399
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:38,839
people we know and um uh and those of us

1400
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:40,319
who have not had that and we are in that

1401
00:58:38,838 --> 00:58:46,078
category there's been a couple of fires

1402
00:58:40,318 --> 00:58:48,558
in our County uh the a big one uh north

1403
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:51,280
of us is happening in the same area

1404
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:53,200
where the fire two years ago killed 80

1405
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:56,119
some people in the town of

1406
00:58:53,199 --> 00:58:59,038
paradise um and that was a fire that was

1407
00:58:56,119 --> 00:59:03,000
started by PG's electrical transmission

1408
00:58:59,039 --> 00:59:05,079
system failing in a River Canyon uh one

1409
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:08,798
of the hangers on a high tension wire

1410
00:59:05,079 --> 00:59:12,798
broke and cascade of Sparks and it was a

1411
00:59:08,798 --> 00:59:15,639
windy morning about 5 o'l and by 7

1412
00:59:12,798 --> 00:59:17,679
o'clock the town of paradise was on fire

1413
00:59:15,639 --> 00:59:21,038
and everybody that was in it that didn't

1414
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:22,919
make it out is one of those 88 dead uh

1415
00:59:21,039 --> 00:59:24,880
so we all live with that idea that that

1416
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:26,838
could happen at any moment particularly

1417
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:30,599
for those of us that live

1418
00:59:26,838 --> 00:59:33,838
in an urban or excuse me the wildlands

1419
00:59:30,599 --> 00:59:35,559
you know the where like myself I live in

1420
00:59:33,838 --> 00:59:38,239
a whole bunch of trees it's a beautiful

1421
00:59:35,559 --> 00:59:40,280
spot I'm me really grateful to have it

1422
00:59:38,239 --> 00:59:42,439
but yeah fire happens here just like Sam

1423
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:45,319
was saying well one of the things you

1424
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:50,318
can do besides a fire break is to have

1425
00:59:45,318 --> 00:59:53,159
tile roofs and have a brick or stone

1426
00:59:50,318 --> 00:59:56,079
exterior walls of your house those are

1427
00:59:53,159 --> 01:00:00,598
almost impossible to burn yeah know

1428
00:59:56,079 --> 01:00:02,960
another really good thing to do is um a

1429
01:00:00,599 --> 01:00:06,640
a lot of the Conifer trees and things

1430
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:09,720
that are right directly around your home

1431
01:00:06,639 --> 01:00:10,920
you cannot have those a conifer tree

1432
01:00:09,719 --> 01:00:13,719
right around your home and then have

1433
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:16,318
more grassy or garden areas right around

1434
01:00:13,719 --> 01:00:19,038
your home and then putting a sprinkler

1435
01:00:16,318 --> 01:00:21,480
on the peak of your roof and hard

1436
01:00:19,039 --> 01:00:23,920
Plumbing in like with maybe a a metal

1437
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:26,240
conduit sprink like sprinklers on the

1438
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:29,079
top of your roof and turn them on so

1439
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:31,000
there's like a wall of water coming down

1440
01:00:29,079 --> 01:00:33,079
your roof and a lot of people have been

1441
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:35,880
able to save their homes with fire just

1442
01:00:33,079 --> 01:00:38,119
going right around their house so you

1443
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:41,000
know I I'm a little nervous that

1444
01:00:38,119 --> 01:00:43,079
everyone's just like oh we gotta cut all

1445
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:45,519
the the branches and trees down in order

1446
01:00:43,079 --> 01:00:47,599
to save ourselves from fires and I just

1447
01:00:45,519 --> 01:00:50,159
want to encourage people instead of

1448
01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:52,838
burning off your branches consider

1449
01:00:50,159 --> 01:00:54,759
digging them into the Earth consider

1450
01:00:52,838 --> 01:00:57,400
putting those branches if you leave them

1451
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:59,520
around your house going to burn anyway

1452
01:00:57,400 --> 01:01:02,240
from the sparks in the

1453
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:04,318
air and to speak what Collins was saying

1454
01:01:02,239 --> 01:01:07,558
mini excavator or someone and dig them

1455
01:01:04,318 --> 01:01:09,558
into the Earth go ahead a uh eucalyptus

1456
01:01:07,559 --> 01:01:12,760
trees are not only a problem they're an

1457
01:01:09,559 --> 01:01:15,519
inundation problem because California

1458
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:18,039
brought in a whole bunch of eucalyptus

1459
01:01:15,519 --> 01:01:20,639
back in the day I think 27 different

1460
01:01:18,039 --> 01:01:21,960
varietal here and they're not indigenous

1461
01:01:20,639 --> 01:01:24,639
they brought them because they wanted

1462
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:26,760
them to grow paper or grow wood

1463
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:29,759
unfortunately the microbes in the soil

1464
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:29,760
causes the

1465
01:01:31,199 --> 01:01:39,118
wood just broke up there oil also kills

1466
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:39,119
a of

1467
01:01:39,318 --> 01:01:45,599
everything sorry the uh the oils also

1468
01:01:42,838 --> 01:01:48,279
you know kill everything below so you've

1469
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:51,960
got a a combination of trees that will

1470
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:54,079
also full of oil that can explode so

1471
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:56,480
that's also a problem in California that

1472
01:01:54,079 --> 01:01:57,920
isn't really talked about you know

1473
01:01:56,480 --> 01:02:01,039
eucalyptus

1474
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:03,440
also out all the moisture from the

1475
01:02:01,039 --> 01:02:06,599
ground and Eucalyptus is not good to

1476
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:09,880
make a hugle pile from go ahead

1477
01:02:06,599 --> 01:02:11,440
Colin yeah I I was just gonna uh just

1478
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:14,318
kind of add to what what you guys were

1479
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:16,960
saying and it's it's an invasive species

1480
01:02:14,318 --> 01:02:19,278
and it does need to be managed and to

1481
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:23,519
your point it's it's hard to Deforest

1482
01:02:19,278 --> 01:02:25,440
eucalyptus because it's so invasive it's

1483
01:02:23,519 --> 01:02:27,079
just it's unbelievable how invasive that

1484
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:31,760
species

1485
01:02:27,079 --> 01:02:33,640
is so I'm amazed how people don't talk

1486
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:36,079
about that reality you know what I'm

1487
01:02:33,639 --> 01:02:39,719
saying none of the news touches on that

1488
01:02:36,079 --> 01:02:42,720
and it's so because it's so invasive

1489
01:02:39,719 --> 01:02:47,439
it's in every forest and thick and they

1490
01:02:42,719 --> 01:02:49,679
overtake a great part of where they they

1491
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:51,599
grow I think yeah you're right I think

1492
01:02:49,679 --> 01:02:54,960
it's a good Marcus wouldn't you say it's

1493
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:57,278
a good time for a for a group dab yeah I

1494
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:59,240
think Johnny B had some of Horatio's

1495
01:02:57,278 --> 01:03:00,920
turp champagne out he was going to make

1496
01:02:59,239 --> 01:03:02,798
a toast maybe and we'll have a nice

1497
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:05,358
little dab I think that's I think that's

1498
01:03:02,798 --> 01:03:09,079
in order I will definitely open this

1499
01:03:05,358 --> 01:03:11,159

1656
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:09,640
hospital like every single person had

1657

par what's

1673
01:10:48,158 --> 01:10:54,839
that it's got a very deep like rich

1674
01:10:52,319 --> 01:10:57,519
flavor to it and it's kind of like a I

1675
01:10:54,840 --> 01:11:00,920
feel like a little Ani or some kind of a

1676
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:02,480
like a deep licorish is Flavor if I'm

1677
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:05,039
right on that I don't know it's it's

1678
01:11:02,479 --> 01:11:07,799
it's very nice and then they made the

1679
01:11:05,039 --> 01:11:10,560
guava punch Brandon and Amanda the guava

1680
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:12,520
punch seeds um and those turned out

1681
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:13,679
phenomenal um and I could probably bring

1682
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:16,520
you a few of those seeds if you're

1683
01:11:13,679 --> 01:11:18,199
interested Johnny oh I'm I'm always

1684
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:19,719
interested in growing and learning about

1685
01:11:18,198 --> 01:11:21,039
turps of finding different strs that

1686
01:11:19,719 --> 01:11:23,480
work for me and stuff like that and that

1687
01:11:21,039 --> 01:11:25,640
was the biggest thing and and when when

1688
01:11:23,479 --> 01:11:27,079
you find something that works like

1689
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:28,760
that's why I preach it so much to

1690
01:11:27,079 --> 01:11:30,760
everybody because [ __ ] works it's like

1691
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:32,239
it's a no-brainer guys it's like if

1692
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:33,880
you're in pain or you're suffering in

1693
01:11:32,238 --> 01:11:35,678
any way or you just want to relax or

1694
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:39,279
just like just just have a good time

1695
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:41,760
smoke a joint but that one that one

1696
01:11:39,279 --> 01:11:43,960
smell it was literally I would pull it

1697
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:45,600
away and like and that's when I started

1698
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:47,480
looking at you know save the turps

1699
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:49,320
looking at Turpin that modulate and how

1700
01:11:47,479 --> 01:11:51,439
it helps me that's why the big thing

1701
01:11:49,319 --> 01:11:53,158
with hertia was the tur means he saw how

1702
01:11:51,439 --> 01:11:54,439
it helped me so much because hertia

1703
01:11:53,158 --> 01:11:56,000
spent a lot of time coming over to the

1704
01:11:54,439 --> 01:11:58,119
house and putting trans normal creams on

1705
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:59,520
my neck when I first came out of surgery

1706
01:11:58,119 --> 01:12:03,198
so if you guys don't know they took out

1707
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:04,400
my C4 and C5 vertebrae um and that's

1708
01:12:03,198 --> 01:12:06,439
what I really started looking at how

1709
01:12:04,399 --> 01:12:08,638
tpin were helping me with my pain

1710
01:12:06,439 --> 01:12:10,759
because of what Mark brought in and what

1711
01:12:08,639 --> 01:12:12,880
Horatio was doing and just everything

1712
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:16,159
that was happening at that point of my

1713
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:17,639
life really pushed me to know that tpin

1714
01:12:16,158 --> 01:12:20,158
was a way of being able to standardize

1715
01:12:17,639 --> 01:12:20,159
my medicine

1716
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:26,280
by controlling water to chase trying to

1717
01:12:23,719 --> 01:12:28,119
standardize my medicine by decar oating

1718
01:12:26,279 --> 01:12:30,079
her she was doing a lot of creams and

1719
01:12:28,119 --> 01:12:32,000
stuff like that that help with healing

1720
01:12:30,079 --> 01:12:36,000
effects which I wish we had that one

1721
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:38,639
recipe U but I mean yeah um now I'm just

1722
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:40,560
talking about you know how great

1723
01:12:38,639 --> 01:12:42,079
cannabis is and how the tpin help so

1724
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:44,199
much but that purple punch was something

1725
01:12:42,079 --> 01:12:46,960
else man it was definitely and we talk

1726
01:12:44,198 --> 01:12:49,439
about the the Hindu Kush has a really

1727
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:52,158
nice flavor uh profile that you might

1728
01:12:49,439 --> 01:12:55,238
like too which is a really good one we

1729
01:12:52,158 --> 01:12:57,599
got the graceand cut um from Southern

1730
01:12:55,238 --> 01:13:01,279
Oregon and grew it out this year and

1731
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:03,400
it's just like ah the old pushes work

1732
01:13:01,279 --> 01:13:06,319
very well for me so look at the many

1733
01:13:03,399 --> 01:13:08,638
Kush is more of like a pre 96 pre 94

1734
01:13:06,319 --> 01:13:12,158
like a Kush uh the Bubba kushes the

1735
01:13:08,639 --> 01:13:14,239
Hindu kushes um PK was that much but

1736
01:13:12,158 --> 01:13:16,279
those heavier indicas is what works well

1737
01:13:14,238 --> 01:13:21,198
for those tpping and those flavors the

1738
01:13:16,279 --> 01:13:23,238
high THC more a higher CBD lower CBN um

1739
01:13:21,198 --> 01:13:25,638
that was a lot of uh yeah a lot of

1740
01:13:23,238 --> 01:13:27,319
research I

1741
01:13:25,639 --> 01:13:30,639
beautiful glazed

1742
01:13:27,319 --> 01:13:34,399
Cherry um crosses that we did this year

1743
01:13:30,639 --> 01:13:37,719
and the the glazed Cherry is like so

1744
01:13:34,399 --> 01:13:41,920
dark and deep red on the stock and the

1745
01:13:37,719 --> 01:13:45,560
leaf and I really love the flavor we uh

1746
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:47,239
we got some of that it was glazed Cherry

1747
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:49,679
I don't know if it was glazed cherry or

1748
01:13:47,238 --> 01:13:52,799
Cross of it from Brandon and Amanda the

1749
01:13:49,679 --> 01:13:56,158
rosin and dude it was some of the most

1750
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:58,719
interesting tpine profile I've had from

1751
01:13:56,158 --> 01:14:00,479
a hash in a while that was like it

1752
01:13:58,719 --> 01:14:02,198
wasn't really like anything else that I

1753
01:14:00,479 --> 01:14:04,439
could say it was so interesting and

1754
01:14:02,198 --> 01:14:06,799
unique I loved it a lot it was it a

1755
01:14:04,439 --> 01:14:10,158
White Lotus glazed Cherry does that make

1756
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:12,719
any does that remind you no okay it was

1757
01:14:10,158 --> 01:14:15,719
a glazed Cherry dog I don't know why

1758
01:14:12,719 --> 01:14:17,880
okay but that makes sense that could

1759
01:14:15,719 --> 01:14:20,119
have been the dog from Jesse and the the

1760
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:23,000
glazed Cherry from Green source is my

1761
01:14:20,119 --> 01:14:26,359
guess okay yeah said it was from bio

1762
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:28,238
Vortex actually so that makes sense

1763
01:14:26,359 --> 01:14:31,119
yeah it's nice to see the lot of the

1764
01:14:28,238 --> 01:14:33,919
Ecuador uh lineage kind of coming back

1765
01:14:31,119 --> 01:14:35,880
into into everyone's pet again you know

1766
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:38,158
the indicia stuff was really dominating

1767
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:40,880
for a long time and I've been really

1768
01:14:38,158 --> 01:14:43,679
partial to the flavors and to the you

1769
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:47,359
know I love gas but I I want more than

1770
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:49,279
just gas I want I'd love to see you know

1771
01:14:47,359 --> 01:14:50,439

1775
01:14:54,439 --> 01:14:57,479
coming out

1776
01:14:55,600 --> 01:15:00,920
I'm growing a lot of really really fun

1777
01:14:57,479 --> 01:15:03,919
stuff that's just super turpy you

1778
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:03,920

1779
01:15:05,399 --> 01:15:10,000
Johnny

1780
01:15:07,639 --> 01:15:13,239
me I was gonna say Johnny you might like

1781
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:15,920
the straw Nana uh to get that get the

1782
01:15:13,238 --> 01:15:17,319
the 14center cut or something like that

1783
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:19,239
uh that might be a really nice one for

1784
01:15:17,319 --> 01:15:21,840
you to run if you like those types of

1785
01:15:19,238 --> 01:15:23,718
chines I just actually tried something

1786
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:25,400
that no one's tried yet it's a the

1787
01:15:23,719 --> 01:15:27,760
24-week black flaming cross with the

1788
01:15:25,399 --> 01:15:29,158
girl SC cookies that was that first when

1789
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:30,679
you saw me like for the first time when

1790
01:15:29,158 --> 01:15:32,960
I first L House Church I was sitting

1791
01:15:30,679 --> 01:15:34,560
there smoking it and that was kind of

1792
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:35,920
something really nice so I'm I'm playing

1793
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:37,920
with all kinds of different flavors but

1794
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:40,158
I like the old school so I'm kind of

1795
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:44,520
digging into some old vaults of some

1796
01:15:40,158 --> 01:15:46,799
8889 91 some of the genetics from just I

1797
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:47,960
guess you know that's what I grew up

1798
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:49,960
with it's what helped me it's what I

1799
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:51,719
like those flavors and all these newer

1800
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:53,279
flavors I mean hitting and I was talking

1801
01:15:51,719 --> 01:15:55,198
with Darren about it and stuff like that

1802
01:15:53,279 --> 01:15:57,238
there it seems like the gas isn't there

1803
01:15:55,198 --> 01:15:59,599
anymore it seems like that old gas is

1804
01:15:57,238 --> 01:16:01,198
just missing from the strains with all

1805
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:03,920
these new genetics and stuff like that

1806
01:16:01,198 --> 01:16:06,119
so it's the gas that kind of works I I

1807
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:09,359
like that I like that dank I like that

1808
01:16:06,119 --> 01:16:11,880
gas I like that flavor terpinolene I

1809
01:16:09,359 --> 01:16:11,880
think that's

1810
01:16:13,319 --> 01:16:19,759
tpin we grew the Jack we drew grew the

1811
01:16:16,719 --> 01:16:23,359
old Jack clone again this year Jack her

1812
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:27,480
yeah Jack is high in terpinolene

1813
01:16:23,359 --> 01:16:29,119
Jack daren's that OG Kush from like 91

1814
01:16:27,479 --> 01:16:31,279
and everybody wants it because it's high

1815
01:16:29,119 --> 01:16:33,559
in that yeah I'm kind of looking at why

1816
01:16:31,279 --> 01:16:35,119
are we losing it Mark what are they

1817
01:16:33,560 --> 01:16:37,440
doing you just want this you need the

1818
01:16:35,119 --> 01:16:39,479
sourer cut then dude I don't know what

1819
01:16:37,439 --> 01:16:41,919
any of you guys are talking about I love

1820
01:16:39,479 --> 01:16:44,198
everything I love it all I just love all

1821
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:45,679
the different flavors and differences

1822
01:16:44,198 --> 01:16:47,399
and I'm like I never seem to be

1823
01:16:45,679 --> 01:16:49,440
complaining I always have like five or

1824
01:16:47,399 --> 01:16:51,039
six different things that are bommer in

1825
01:16:49,439 --> 01:16:53,279
front of me that are just all different

1826
01:16:51,039 --> 01:16:55,359
I always have the straw Nana definitely

1827
01:16:53,279 --> 01:16:58,479
like always have some

1828
01:16:55,359 --> 01:17:00,519
strawana it's like it's it's like

1829
01:16:58,479 --> 01:17:02,638
picking the lead violin out of the

1830
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:04,760
orchestra and saying yeah I like the

1831
01:17:02,639 --> 01:17:09,880
violin yeah like

1832
01:17:04,760 --> 01:17:15,920
the I see I see you guys are mostly

1833
01:17:09,880 --> 01:17:15,920
vaping on uh uh pipes with a

1834
01:17:18,399 --> 01:17:24,119
torch do you have there he muted

1835
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:26,760
himself what do you have there Sam show

1836
01:17:24,119 --> 01:17:30,679
us that put that that's a Swiss perk

1837
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:34,159
it's a Swiss perk for sure with an email

1838
01:17:30,679 --> 01:17:37,399
exactly but what's unusual is I haven't

1839
01:17:34,158 --> 01:17:37,399
turned it off in three

1840
01:17:39,639 --> 01:17:45,520
years it's been

1841
01:17:42,319 --> 01:17:48,079
the except for I took it to Jamaica for

1842
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:50,480
a couple of weeks ever since Trump got

1843
01:17:48,079 --> 01:17:55,039
elected as soon as Trump got elected he

1844
01:17:50,479 --> 01:17:57,718
turned it on right oh my god dude that

1845
01:17:55,039 --> 01:18:00,039
was three years ago right I left my Dil

1846
01:17:57,719 --> 01:18:01,560
on for about two years and then one day

1847
01:18:00,039 --> 01:18:03,439
I was in the shower and I came out the

1848
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:05,039
whole bottom of the bow F off and it

1849
01:18:03,439 --> 01:18:07,359
burnt a hole in my counter and I

1850
01:18:05,039 --> 01:18:09,319
unplugged it and have put it away has it

1851
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:11,559
been plugged in for years now almost

1852
01:18:09,319 --> 01:18:15,119
burnt down my

1853
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:16,080
house don't do that maybe it's because I

1854
01:18:15,119 --> 01:18:21,039
have a

1855
01:18:16,079 --> 01:18:21,039
davinator they're built in Germany with

1856
01:18:21,639 --> 01:18:25,440
discipline yeah they don't they don't

1857
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:28,079
they're not good on humor but they're

1858
01:18:25,439 --> 01:18:28,079
great on

1859
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:34,199
engineering that but they work with both

1860
01:18:31,119 --> 01:18:36,000
a European and American electricity

1861
01:18:34,198 --> 01:18:37,799
that's that's that's that's what I liked

1862
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:39,880
about the dabinator to be honest I

1863
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:41,639
always would like take my dils to

1864
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:45,560
Amsterdam and then I would forget that

1865
01:18:41,639 --> 01:18:46,679
like 40 pound inverter converter thing

1866
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:49,039
that they would give me at the

1867
01:18:46,679 --> 01:18:50,760
krasnapolsky hotel it was I I carried

1868
01:18:49,039 --> 01:18:52,920
that thing around Amsterdam with me

1869
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:56,480
that's how ridiculous this is and when I

1870
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:58,520
finally met the daban dude he was just

1871
01:18:56,479 --> 01:18:59,879
like here take one of these check it out

1872
01:18:58,520 --> 01:19:01,360
and I traveled all around with that

1873
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:03,400
thing and all I had to do was plug a

1874
01:19:01,359 --> 01:19:05,198
different plug into the back of the unit

1875
01:19:03,399 --> 01:19:09,399
and I didn't have to carry any giant

1876
01:19:05,198 --> 01:19:13,119
thing and I was like okay that is pretty

1877
01:19:09,399 --> 01:19:15,519
awesome also works with 12 volt yeah

1878
01:19:13,119 --> 01:19:17,719
well now companies make them in EU

1879
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:20,199
earlier ones was a challenge but I know

1880
01:19:17,719 --> 01:19:24,079
like yeah denail mini they all make EU

1881
01:19:20,198 --> 01:19:26,198
units now so you know what would happen

1882
01:19:24,079 --> 01:19:28,399
did you have it happened to you at like

1883
01:19:26,198 --> 01:19:30,119
what happens when you take that to a

1884
01:19:28,399 --> 01:19:32,279
different country and plug it in with

1885
01:19:30,119 --> 01:19:35,679
the different plug with no

1886
01:19:32,279 --> 01:19:37,519
inverter I had no issues yeah well

1887
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:39,119
generally what would happen to the dils

1888
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:42,080
when I first got them and I I don't know

1889
01:19:39,119 --> 01:19:44,920
what years this was 2000 something it

1890
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:46,719
would uh it would Pooch the whip the

1891
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:48,359
electricity would go through and just

1892
01:19:46,719 --> 01:19:50,000
instantly Pooch the Whip and I have a

1893
01:19:48,359 --> 01:19:52,079
video where I'm in my little apartment

1894
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:53,520
in the K and the pulsky and I've got the

1895
01:19:52,079 --> 01:19:55,800
camera set up and I'm kind of moving

1896
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:58,960
around I'm setting everything up and I

1897
01:19:55,800 --> 01:20:02,600
realize it happens I go over I'm like oh

1898
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:04,560
no [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] and I it was so

1899
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:06,199
[ __ ] hilarious I kept it in the video

1900
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:07,880
I was like oh I got to let people see my

1901
01:20:06,198 --> 01:20:10,799
reaction to this because it's so

1902
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:13,480
honestly like bummed and pissed and then

1903
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:15,239
I find I remember I brought I remember

1904
01:20:13,479 --> 01:20:18,919
this had happened to me already at least

1905
01:20:15,238 --> 01:20:22,479
one time so I had brought an extra

1906
01:20:18,920 --> 01:20:24,840
whip you may may if you were you'll be

1907
01:20:22,479 --> 01:20:26,039
in the video I think it was Tony for

1908
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:28,679
some reason but you might have been in

1909
01:20:26,039 --> 01:20:30,840
the video too it's on YouTube it's one

1910
01:20:28,679 --> 01:20:32,079
of my videos pluged in the inverter and

1911
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:33,239
you didn't plug in the inverter we plug

1912
01:20:32,079 --> 01:20:35,079
I think I might have plugged into the

1913
01:20:33,238 --> 01:20:37,000
wall and blew it and we didn't have the

1914
01:20:35,079 --> 01:20:39,840
Dil in the be remember that one was that

1915
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:41,119
Spain well that might have been no that

1916
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:43,039
might have been Amsterdam the year

1917
01:20:41,119 --> 01:20:44,639
before which is why I brought the second

1918
01:20:43,039 --> 01:20:46,479
whip I'd have to go back and watch the

1919
01:20:44,639 --> 01:20:50,679
video but it doesn't sound like the one

1920
01:20:46,479 --> 01:20:53,279
you did that day after you had done it

1921
01:20:50,679 --> 01:20:55,319

1922
01:20:53,279 --> 01:20:58,319

1928
01:21:08,238 --> 01:21:15,879
take an extra whip just in case dude I'm

1929
01:21:12,319 --> 01:21:18,238

01:21:27,279 --> 01:21:33,800
but she painted this photo of a Tricom

1935
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:38,159
of mine I took this photo at my friend's

1936
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:39,880
house in Port Al Bernie uh a long time

1937
01:21:38,158 --> 01:21:43,000
ago I don't know if it was over 10 years

1938
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:45,119
ago the cultivar is uh burmes [ __ ]

1939
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:47,279
incredible is the cultivar but she she

1940
01:21:45,119 --> 01:21:49,119
painted this little triome photo for me

1941
01:21:47,279 --> 01:21:50,559
up above my shoulder here and I just

1942
01:21:49,119 --> 01:21:52,238
wanted to give her a shout out and a

1943
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:54,760
thank you because uh she should have

1944
01:21:52,238 --> 01:21:58,238
painted the one with your face in

1945
01:21:54,760 --> 01:22:01,199
reflecting in the triome head those were

1946
01:21:58,238 --> 01:22:05,238
the clear domes I do have a video where

1947
01:22:01,198 --> 01:22:08,238
I put headband hash on a sapphire insert

1948
01:22:05,238 --> 01:22:10,158
by denail and I put it on and I it's the

1949
01:22:08,238 --> 01:22:13,000
most incredible thing it starts bubbling

1950
01:22:10,158 --> 01:22:15,399
like crazy and in every single bubble

1951
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:17,560
you can see my reflection of me hitting

1952
01:22:15,399 --> 01:22:21,479
the pipe it was definitely like some

1953
01:22:17,560 --> 01:22:24,239
crazy hash Inception uh type [ __ ] but if

1954
01:22:21,479 --> 01:22:26,000
you guys haven't seen that I'll uh I

1955
01:22:24,238 --> 01:22:28,599

1985
01:23:56,840 --> 01:24:03,440
different dude I wish I had a video of

1986
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:05,960
me making this video and then watching

1987
01:24:03,439 --> 01:24:07,839
it while editing it and realizing what

1988
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:10,439
had happened I wish I had a video of

1989
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:14,239
that because I was also very Johnny bees

1990
01:24:10,439 --> 01:24:15,719
I was like a child in a candy store oh

1991
01:24:14,238 --> 01:24:18,198
it's like you're getting high in all

1992
01:24:15,719 --> 01:24:20,079
these different dimensions oh my god

1993
01:24:18,198 --> 01:24:22,079
dude as a macro photographer

1994
01:24:20,079 --> 01:24:23,600
videographer like I had never captured

1995
01:24:22,079 --> 01:24:26,000
anything like that before I'd have been

1996
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:27,760
working with for fractions this is the

1997
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:29,920
first refraction photo I ever took and

1998
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:31,719
if you look closely in the Tricom

1999
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:33,719
there's a reflection of a cannabis leaf

2000
01:24:31,719 --> 01:24:36,880
in the two main tricomes in the in the

2001
01:24:33,719 --> 01:24:39,319
tall Tricom so that was my first ver

2002
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:41,199
version of it that I ever got and uh I

2003
01:24:39,319 --> 01:24:43,840
never really went too much further in it

2004
01:24:41,198 --> 01:24:45,919
and then I got that video and so really

2005
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:47,960
this photo and that video are really the

2006
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:50,600
only two refractions that I have where

2007
01:24:47,960 --> 01:24:52,840
I'm like in in you know something's

2008
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:56,000
reflected in it looks pretty

2009
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:58,600
cool marus I'm G to ask you something do

2010
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:01,880
you have videos of teaching how to take

2011
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:05,360
macro photographies you inspired a lot

2012
01:25:01,880 --> 01:25:06,960
and I just got a macro oh nice well you

2013
01:25:05,359 --> 01:25:09,158
know what we'll do another show but

2014
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:11,279
there is one where I invited some really

2015
01:25:09,158 --> 01:25:13,439
great macro photographers I I can't

2016
01:25:11,279 --> 01:25:17,238
remember maybe Eric nug shots was on

2017
01:25:13,439 --> 01:25:19,399
there and uh Shale I think showed up and

2018
01:25:17,238 --> 01:25:22,638
I had invited like all all the

2019
01:25:19,399 --> 01:25:24,679
guys yeah yeah I I basically had invited

2020
01:25:22,639 --> 01:25:26,880
all the people I thought of as sort of

2021
01:25:24,679 --> 01:25:28,800
had that had taken M that macro cannabis

2022
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:30,960
photography to the next level I sort of

2023
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:33,560
stopped at a level these guys just took

2024
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:35,079
it to the next level uh doing a bunch of

2025
01:25:33,560 --> 01:25:37,600
things that I wanted to do but never

2026
01:25:35,079 --> 01:25:39,158
really got uh you know inspired enough

2027
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:41,639
to to make it happen and like for

2028
01:25:39,158 --> 01:25:44,118
instance Shale creating his own

2029
01:25:41,639 --> 01:25:47,239
measurement scale with the triome heads

2030
01:25:44,118 --> 01:25:49,519
and now like you know 118 microns like

2031
01:25:47,238 --> 01:25:50,879
that I wanted to do for like 10 years so

2032
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:52,080
I was I hit him up the other day I was

2033
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:54,440
like dude where did you get that

2034
01:25:52,079 --> 01:25:56,319
template he's like I made it I just made

2035
01:25:54,439 --> 01:25:57,799
the template I was like damn right on

2036
01:25:56,319 --> 01:26:00,639
bro that's what's up that's cuz that

2037
01:25:57,800 --> 01:26:03,600
shit's not easily available to just go

2038
01:26:00,639 --> 01:26:05,359
and find somewhere so we did one show

2039
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:07,840
all of those guys were on it and we

2040
01:26:05,359 --> 01:26:09,599
talked about macro photography um I

2041
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:11,279
wanted to invite a variety of people

2042
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:13,320
because depending on the lens that you

2043
01:26:11,279 --> 01:26:15,639
have you really need to take your advice

2044
01:26:13,319 --> 01:26:18,439
from someone who has that that lens you

2045
01:26:15,639 --> 01:26:20,440
know if I give you advice for an MPE

2046
01:26:18,439 --> 01:26:23,799
Canon lens and you're using reversals

2047
01:26:20,439 --> 01:26:26,960
with Billows and and uh extension tubes

2048
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:29,079
it's a it's not quite the same so um I

2049
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:32,039
don't know what kind of macro camera you

2050
01:26:29,079 --> 01:26:33,880
have or lens but uh it makes it inspires

2051
01:26:32,039 --> 01:26:36,800
me to do another show invite those guys

2052
01:26:33,880 --> 01:26:39,039
on I really wanted to photograph like

2053
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:42,199
resin heads too but not only on the

2054
01:26:39,039 --> 01:26:45,000
plant and you you talked about it a lot

2055
01:26:42,198 --> 01:26:47,519
like actually photographing the Mel you

2056
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:50,719
know like the Tricom heads like

2057
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:52,679
separated and that's what I want for and

2058
01:26:50,719 --> 01:26:55,279
photograph all the single Source we make

2059
01:26:52,679 --> 01:26:56,840
so we can like understand more not to

2060
01:26:55,279 --> 01:27:00,079
make not only to make photography you

2061
01:26:56,840 --> 01:27:03,760
know but also to study the plants like I

2062
01:27:00,079 --> 01:27:07,079
think Marcus check out check out duie

2063
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:09,440
duck he's an amazing macro photographer

2064
01:27:07,079 --> 01:27:13,359
I've known dubie for years dude his

2065
01:27:09,439 --> 01:27:18,279
stuff is whole other level yeah

2066
01:27:13,359 --> 01:27:20,599
noell did you ever do stacked shots so

2067
01:27:18,279 --> 01:27:22,960
that you increase your dep the field

2068
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:24,840
well that's what these guys do now the

2069
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:27,079
majority of them are stacking shots I

2070
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:28,679
never stacked shots I did Stack

2071
01:27:27,079 --> 01:27:30,079
photography I remember the first time a

2072
01:27:28,679 --> 01:27:32,960
guy showed me he's like this is how you

2073
01:27:30,079 --> 01:27:34,760
do stack photography and he had a rail

2074
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:36,880
system and this intense thing and it was

2075
01:27:34,760 --> 01:27:39,239
like moving the camera a tiny little bit

2076
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:41,239
each time he took a shot and I was like

2077
01:27:39,238 --> 01:27:43,279
you know I think I've got a better idea

2078
01:27:41,238 --> 01:27:45,599
and I put my subject the first stacked

2079
01:27:43,279 --> 01:27:48,559
image I ever did it was 35 shots I put

2080
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:51,119
the subject on my bubble box with a felt

2081
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:55,000
bottom on a wooden table and I took

2082
01:27:51,118 --> 01:27:57,679
shots and then I pushed the the the the

2083
01:27:55,000 --> 01:28:00,039
box over to the right like just a a

2084
01:27:57,679 --> 01:28:01,840
millimeter each time and took the shots

2085
01:28:00,039 --> 01:28:03,639
his chin was on the floor he couldn't

2086
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:06,319
believe it he'd always been moving his

2087
01:28:03,639 --> 01:28:09,359
camera he never thought to move the

2088
01:28:06,319 --> 01:28:10,840
subject and so I just did that took 35

2089
01:28:09,359 --> 01:28:13,719
shots snapped him together it was

2090
01:28:10,840 --> 01:28:15,199
similar to this shot um this has shot

2091
01:28:13,719 --> 01:28:17,359
but it was uh it was a little bit

2092
01:28:15,198 --> 01:28:19,079
different it looked great but it felt

2093
01:28:17,359 --> 01:28:21,000
like to me I think I'm just an old

2094
01:28:19,079 --> 01:28:23,559
school photographer it felt kind of like

2095
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:26,039
cheating it it took away that challenge

2096
01:28:23,560 --> 01:28:28,840
it is Che

2097
01:28:26,039 --> 01:28:32,079
yeah it took away the challenge

2098
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:33,319
of well and reducing the depth of field

2099
01:28:32,079 --> 01:28:35,319
I'll tell you something from my

2100
01:28:33,319 --> 01:28:38,559
photography and it I started taking my

2101
01:28:35,319 --> 01:28:41,359
shots like this one handheld I don't put

2102
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:43,080
my camera on a tripod I want to learn

2103
01:28:41,359 --> 01:28:45,000
how to actually take that photo and

2104
01:28:43,079 --> 01:28:47,399
manipulate that small depth of field

2105
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:48,719
that I have and I always suggest to

2106
01:28:47,399 --> 01:28:51,479
people who want to learn macro

2107
01:28:48,719 --> 01:28:53,480
photography learn to do this first and

2108
01:28:51,479 --> 01:28:55,198
then learn stacking because if you learn

2109
01:28:53,479 --> 01:28:57,359
stacking first when I talk to these

2110
01:28:55,198 --> 01:29:00,158
stack guys they can't believe that I'm

2111
01:28:57,359 --> 01:29:04,759
taking my shots handheld and getting the

2112
01:29:00,158 --> 01:29:07,719
shots that I'm getting yeah automatic

2113
01:29:04,760 --> 01:29:10,960
yeah some do some some do stack in the

2114
01:29:07,719 --> 01:29:12,800
macro I I have a Lumix gh5 and uh it

2115
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:14,760
does amazing stacking just totally

2116
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:17,760
automatic on the 6K

2117
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:19,960
function nice I I was goingon to say you

2118
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:22,960
know Marcus I think you were the first

2119
01:29:19,960 --> 01:29:25,399
person I ever met uh you know I think we

2120
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:27,279
connected as artist and creatives really

2121
01:29:25,399 --> 01:29:31,519
and then cannabis was kind of second for

2122
01:29:27,279 --> 01:29:33,800
us um who really made sense to me to

2123
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:35,360
look at the plant from a closer point of

2124
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:37,159
view and using your lenses and the tools

2125
01:29:35,359 --> 01:29:39,759
that you're using as creatives to make

2126
01:29:37,158 --> 01:29:42,039
other projects and other things to learn

2127
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:44,440
about the resin and really look towards

2128
01:29:42,039 --> 01:29:46,679
the plant as not only a subject matter

2129
01:29:44,439 --> 01:29:48,519
but a vehicle to learn about the

2130
01:29:46,679 --> 01:29:50,118
chemicals and the the different things

2131
01:29:48,520 --> 01:29:52,760
that you

2132
01:29:50,118 --> 01:29:54,679
could um such as extraction and and

2133
01:29:52,760 --> 01:29:57,960
whatnot but

2134
01:29:54,679 --> 01:29:59,279
um I think that's really the first you

2135
01:29:57,960 --> 01:30:01,920
know some of the first photography

2136
01:29:59,279 --> 01:30:05,198
Marcus was was from of Tricom heads was

2137
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:08,000
really that I saw other than scientific

2138
01:30:05,198 --> 01:30:09,919
photography was really from you um in

2139
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:12,920
the work that you you had kind of put

2140
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:14,800
out um so you know helpful and so

2141
01:30:12,920 --> 01:30:16,319
graciously because you know not

2142
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:18,159
everybody was sharing that kind of point

2143
01:30:16,319 --> 01:30:20,719
of view at that point in time that that

2144
01:30:18,158 --> 01:30:24,158
you know that late 90s early 2000s kind

2145
01:30:20,719 --> 01:30:26,198
of black space as we will yeah you know

2146
01:30:24,158 --> 01:30:28,839
I got I got to shout out perhaps your

2147
01:30:26,198 --> 01:30:31,719
giddy Aunt who took the first clear Dome

2148
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:34,039
shot on a screen that was like Epic on

2149
01:30:31,719 --> 01:30:36,520
an overgrow days I met him in London and

2150

he brought me framed framed photo of it

2151

and some beautiful bubble has that he

2152
01:30:38,079 --> 01:30:41,880
brought me each day of the of the

2153
01:30:40,079 --> 01:30:44,679
conference we did in Wembley Stadium I

2154
01:30:41,880 --> 01:30:48,000

2155
01:30:44,679 --> 01:30:49,960
also shout out to monkey from uh really

2156
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:51,719
shout out to Monkey because from my

2157
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:54,399
perspective I wanted to learn macro

2158
01:30:51,719 --> 01:30:55,679
photography I asked Jason King who was a

2159
01:30:54,399 --> 01:30:57,118
friend of mine at the time I was like

2160
01:30:55,679 --> 01:30:59,199
hey dude like you've taken a couple of

2161
01:30:57,118 --> 01:31:01,238
macro shots like would you mind showing

2162
01:30:59,198 --> 01:31:03,479
me how to take some macro photographs he

2163
01:31:01,238 --> 01:31:05,399
said oh yeah yeah no problem uh just as

2164
01:31:03,479 --> 01:31:07,079
soon as you show me how to uh design and

2165
01:31:05,399 --> 01:31:08,399
manufacture bubble bags in Nepal and

2166
01:31:07,079 --> 01:31:10,519
sell them around the world on the

2167
01:31:08,399 --> 01:31:13,359
internet and I was kind of like I was

2168
01:31:10,520 --> 01:31:15,760
kind of like oh [ __ ] like did I was that

2169
01:31:13,359 --> 01:31:17,559
a bad move on my part and I kind of in

2170
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:19,000
the end just took it to the fact that he

2171
01:31:17,560 --> 01:31:21,960
was maybe being a bit of a dick and

2172
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:24,198
being insecure but uh when monkey when I

2173
01:31:21,960 --> 01:31:26,920
he was taking bug shots on overgrow

2174
01:31:24,198 --> 01:31:28,759
shots of uh his insects his pray

2175
01:31:26,920 --> 01:31:31,600
mantises that he would order from the

2176
01:31:28,760 --> 01:31:33,880
from the mail mail order and crack these

2177
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:35,560
eggs and grow these incredible pray

2178
01:31:33,880 --> 01:31:38,760
mantises out that would he would take

2179
01:31:35,560 --> 01:31:41,400
photographs of that were just shockingly

2180
01:31:38,760 --> 01:31:42,800
beautiful and he had the MP lens and I

2181
01:31:41,399 --> 01:31:44,279
hit him up one day and I was like Hey I

2182
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:47,039
want to get into macro photography he's

2183
01:31:44,279 --> 01:31:51,880
like okay buy the 65 millimeter MP lens

2184
01:31:47,039 --> 01:31:54,719
with the 24 uh e ex M Mt dual flash from

2185
01:31:51,880 --> 01:31:56,239
Canon uh set your ISO on a

2186
01:31:54,719 --> 01:31:59,399
set your he starts telling me all these

2187
01:31:56,238 --> 01:32:02,599
settings as a base and since he did that

2188
01:31:59,399 --> 01:32:04,638
I have always shared every I don't even

2189
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:06,520
feel like it's my I always feel like I'm

2190
01:32:04,639 --> 01:32:08,639
sharing his information that it's just

2191
01:32:06,520 --> 01:32:10,400
like pass it all on even though at this

2192
01:32:08,639 --> 01:32:12,000
point it's like 15 years of my own

2193
01:32:10,399 --> 01:32:15,839
knowledge that I've learned from taking

2194
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:18,399
macro photography I just don't see why

2195
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:20,400
it would be a bummer for me to to show

2196
01:32:18,399 --> 01:32:22,359
people like there are people who will

2197
01:32:20,399 --> 01:32:23,960
put time into this in a way that I don't

2198
01:32:22,359 --> 01:32:26,960
have the time anymore there are people

2199
01:32:23,960 --> 01:32:28,480
who will put time and have access to

2200
01:32:26,960 --> 01:32:30,439
certain things whether it's exotic

2201
01:32:28,479 --> 01:32:32,839
looking plants or beautiful resins you

2202
01:32:30,439 --> 01:32:34,359
know that's the key it's one thing if

2203
01:32:32,840 --> 01:32:36,639
you want to take macro photographies of

2204
01:32:34,359 --> 01:32:39,639
resin it's another like do you have all

2205
01:32:36,639 --> 01:32:41,679
the top quality access to you know the

2206
01:32:39,639 --> 01:32:44,800
highest grade material because that

2207
01:32:41,679 --> 01:32:46,440
becomes the super duper key these love

2208
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:48,119
birds looking at each other about their

2209
01:32:46,439 --> 01:32:49,799
beautiful resins they're staring into

2210
01:32:48,118 --> 01:32:51,719
each other's eyes they're like loving

2211
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:54,239
the fact that they got all the flavors

2212
01:32:51,719 --> 01:32:56,719
they're like oozing and gooing good on

2213
01:32:54,238 --> 01:32:58,678
you guys the other thing Marcus is you

2214
01:32:56,719 --> 01:33:00,158
know the there each photographer is

2215
01:32:58,679 --> 01:33:02,000
going to bring a different point of view

2216
01:33:00,158 --> 01:33:04,439
like I I was inspired by people like

2217
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:06,439
Tobin Yellen and like even Bruce Weber

2218
01:33:04,439 --> 01:33:09,359
of shooting like weird black and white

2219
01:33:06,439 --> 01:33:13,319
fashion photography and you know the the

2220
01:33:09,359 --> 01:33:15,799
ideas that you can you know bring to the

2221
01:33:13,319 --> 01:33:18,479
subject is is really kind of really

2222
01:33:15,800 --> 01:33:20,279
Broad and and just like cultivation and

2223
01:33:18,479 --> 01:33:23,238
extraction there's a lot of creativity

2224
01:33:20,279 --> 01:33:25,840
that you can bring to it so I also got a

2225
01:33:23,238 --> 01:33:28,359
shout out you deas he was taking photos

2226
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:30,760
in the 80s in Holland with the electron

2227
01:33:28,359 --> 01:33:32,839
scan microscope um when I went to the

2228
01:33:30,760 --> 01:33:35,840
first Cannabis Cup my first Cannabis Cup

2229
01:33:32,840 --> 01:33:38,440
not the first Cannabis Cup was in

2230
01:33:35,840 --> 01:33:39,960
1995 uh and I saw his little postcards

2231
01:33:38,439 --> 01:33:42,158
he had them at all these different sort

2232
01:33:39,960 --> 01:33:44,679
of smart shops and I would buy these

2233
01:33:42,158 --> 01:33:47,039
beautiful perfect Tricom shots they

2234
01:33:44,679 --> 01:33:49,118
would look so surreal and if many of you

2235
01:33:47,039 --> 01:33:51,639
remember my first advertisement in

2236
01:33:49,118 --> 01:33:53,479
cannabis culture for Bubble Bags was a

2237
01:33:51,639 --> 01:33:54,880
photo that I purchased off of you I

2238
01:33:53,479 --> 01:33:56,559
remember remember I was so blown away

2239
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:58,600
that he was willing to sell it for 800

2240
01:33:56,560 --> 01:34:00,560
gilders I was just like like it's my

2241
01:33:58,600 --> 01:34:02,440
photo he's like it's your photo like you

2242

2244
01:34:04,319 --> 01:34:07,880

work that that he's doing and it's just

2276
01:35:25,039 --> 01:35:29,840
amazing to see like a far away nug shot

2277
01:35:27,880 --> 01:35:31,840
where it's spinning and then it goes in

2278
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:34,480
and then in farther and farther all the

2279
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:36,440
way into like the heads you know from a

2280
01:35:34,479 --> 01:35:39,359
far away shot it's like [ __ ] that's

2281
01:35:36,439 --> 01:35:40,839
[ __ ] s such a killer I think Eric

2282
01:35:39,359 --> 01:35:43,039
might have been the first one to start

2283
01:35:40,840 --> 01:35:45,000
doing that I I I could be wrong but I

2284
01:35:43,039 --> 01:35:46,600
think it yeah he was in there for sure

2285
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:48,479
yeah I remember seeing it too and being

2286
01:35:46,600 --> 01:35:50,320
like this is

2287
01:35:48,479 --> 01:35:52,559
spectacular like

2288
01:35:50,319 --> 01:35:54,238
absolutely crushing yeah know I love

2289
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:55,560
these guys doing all this

2290
01:35:54,238 --> 01:35:58,079
all this great stuff with macro

2291
01:35:55,560 --> 01:35:59,920
photographs and Alice has inspired me to

2292
01:35:58,079 --> 01:36:01,319
put a list together if you guys have you

2293
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:02,880
know want to send me a private message

2294
01:36:01,319 --> 01:36:04,679
with some names and I'll check out the

2295
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:06,359
photography and I'll get a nice like 10

2296
01:36:04,679 --> 01:36:07,880
to 12 person group think about it it's

2297
01:36:06,359 --> 01:36:10,399
never been done those guys have never

2298
01:36:07,880 --> 01:36:11,840
gathered in one spot and and who knows

2299
01:36:10,399 --> 01:36:13,599
maybe lives changed maybe they're not

2300
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:15,960
going to want to share their information

2301
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:18,199
as readily as they once did but maybe

2302
01:36:15,960 --> 01:36:20,439
they do and maybe is is a real special

2303
01:36:18,198 --> 01:36:22,719
show particularly in the sense that it

2304
01:36:20,439 --> 01:36:24,319
turns into a lot of other people being

2305
01:36:22,719 --> 01:36:26,039
inspired like

2306
01:36:24,319 --> 01:36:27,880
I don't get the idea of like if the

2307
01:36:26,039 --> 01:36:29,760
whole thing is to pass the flame and

2308
01:36:27,880 --> 01:36:31,319
like some little spark starts it over

2309
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:33,039
here and then that gets passed over to

2310
01:36:31,319 --> 01:36:34,479
here and it finally makes it to you like

2311
01:36:33,039 --> 01:36:36,039
do you really want to put that [ __ ] out

2312
01:36:34,479 --> 01:36:38,678
before you pass it on to the next person

2313
01:36:36,039 --> 01:36:40,198
or hoard it and you know burn your whole

2314
01:36:38,679 --> 01:36:41,679
interior down like I think you're just

2315
01:36:40,198 --> 01:36:43,559
supposed to have it for a while and then

2316
01:36:41,679 --> 01:36:46,960
share it at least that's how it feels to

2317
01:36:43,560 --> 01:36:50,239
me yeah I don't believe in hoarding

2318
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:53,800
information I believe no the message

2319
01:36:50,238 --> 01:36:56,559
like free up The Vibes I teach everybody

2320
01:36:53,800 --> 01:36:59,920
how to use a rail system how to use

2321
01:36:56,560 --> 01:37:02,320
Focus you know push and pull you know

2322
01:36:59,920 --> 01:37:04,520
I'd also teach them lighting and I I'd

2323
01:37:02,319 --> 01:37:06,319
love I think it would be really I don't

2324
01:37:04,520 --> 01:37:09,360
know Marcus I think that that would be a

2325
01:37:06,319 --> 01:37:12,079
really cool show to to go

2326
01:37:09,359 --> 01:37:15,359
through you know what it means to to

2327
01:37:12,079 --> 01:37:18,479
shoot you know it's totally it's a

2328
01:37:15,359 --> 01:37:20,799
specialty as much as it is growing andow

2329
01:37:18,479 --> 01:37:23,678
growing with Organic soils and hash

2330
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:25,520
making like it is a very specialized

2331
01:37:23,679 --> 01:37:27,719
things I kind of one thing about

2332
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:29,840
cannabis is that it has definitely got

2333
01:37:27,719 --> 01:37:32,840
me over the years to have to learn an

2334
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:34,760
enormous amount just to learn about it

2335
01:37:32,840 --> 01:37:36,679
and to and to be able to share it I

2336
01:37:34,760 --> 01:37:38,639
started have now I'm a photographer now

2337
01:37:36,679 --> 01:37:41,440
I'm a macro photographer now I'm a

2338
01:37:38,639 --> 01:37:43,400
videographer now I'm an editor now I'm a

2339
01:37:41,439 --> 01:37:45,279
like it's just like one thing after the

2340
01:37:43,399 --> 01:37:47,479
other that you have to learn now I'm

2341
01:37:45,279 --> 01:37:49,198
doing like podcasts and live streaming

2342
01:37:47,479 --> 01:37:51,559
and I got to learn that like it's just

2343
01:37:49,198 --> 01:37:53,919
one thing these things are like you

2344
01:37:51,560 --> 01:37:57,599
don't learn them overnight take take a

2345
01:37:53,920 --> 01:38:00,118
good amount of uh investment in time so

2346
01:37:57,599 --> 01:38:01,719
I I do agree with Michael Poland when he

2347
01:38:00,118 --> 01:38:03,279
wrote in the I don't even know if you

2348
01:38:01,719 --> 01:38:05,198
wrote this in the botney of Desire but

2349
01:38:03,279 --> 01:38:07,800
you definitely spoke about it maybe in a

2350
01:38:05,198 --> 01:38:09,879
podcast in regards to how successful

2351
01:38:07,800 --> 01:38:13,320
cannabis if you considered cannabis as a

2352
01:38:09,880 --> 01:38:15,800
virus like the same way like Corps can

2353
01:38:13,319 --> 01:38:18,158
infect an insect control that insect's

2354
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:20,840
brain move it to the top of a tree so

2355
01:38:18,158 --> 01:38:23,679
when the spores fruit and and blow out

2356
01:38:20,840 --> 01:38:27,079
they get a greater distance cannabis is

2357
01:38:23,679 --> 01:38:29,039
truly the corps plant uh to humans to

2358
01:38:27,079 --> 01:38:31,319
some of us anyway because it's it gets

2359
01:38:29,039 --> 01:38:32,920
in and then it literally is like I

2360
01:38:31,319 --> 01:38:34,519
should grow lots of cannabis I should

2361
01:38:32,920 --> 01:38:37,039
make lots of hash from the Cannabis that

2362
01:38:34,520 --> 01:38:38,520
I grow I should do shows on YouTube

2363
01:38:37,039 --> 01:38:39,920
telling people about the Cannabis that I

2364
01:38:38,520 --> 01:38:41,440
grow and the hash that I make and how

2365
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:43,039
great it is and that they should do it

2366
01:38:41,439 --> 01:38:44,799
and I should do shows on photography on

2367
01:38:43,039 --> 01:38:47,039
cannabis and hash and how great it is to

2368
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:49,800
photograph and it's really quite

2369
01:38:47,039 --> 01:38:53,158
something how deep it's rooted in some

2370
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:56,159
of our brains it's uh sounds like church

2371
01:38:53,158 --> 01:39:00,158
and that's what makes it a true Master

2372
01:38:56,158 --> 01:39:02,000
plant that's why it's a master plant and

2373
01:39:00,158 --> 01:39:04,000
that's why plant medicine is so

2374
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:07,118

an absolute piece of [ __ ] low-level

2471
01:43:12,560 --> 01:43:19,239
thing to do to steal someone's hard work

2472
01:43:14,840 --> 01:43:24,119
like that and their livelihood

2473
01:43:19,238 --> 01:43:26,039
medicine yeah it's uh happens

2474
01:43:24,118 --> 01:43:29,759
yeah it does in the case of Nick risen

2475
01:43:26,039 --> 01:43:33,158
he makes RSO or cannabis oil for himself

2476
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:35,800
to fight limes disease and he's truly

2477
01:43:33,158 --> 01:43:37,638
keeping himself alive he would be a good

2478
01:43:35,800 --> 01:43:39,199
person to have on the show sometime you

2479
01:43:37,639 --> 01:43:41,079
know because he's just so knowledgeable

2480
01:43:39,198 --> 01:43:44,198
about strains and medicine and what it

2481
01:43:41,079 --> 01:43:47,319
takes to survive um you know he just

2482
01:43:44,198 --> 01:43:48,839
recently had a you know crazy skin

2483
01:43:47,319 --> 01:43:51,039
eating bacteria and things but he's

2484
01:43:48,840 --> 01:43:53,880
making it through a lot of stuff so big

2485
01:43:51,039 --> 01:43:57,198
love to him limes is a really serious i'

2486
01:43:53,880 --> 01:43:59,719
I've had limes twice and uh it doesn't

2487
01:43:57,198 --> 01:44:01,399
go away but when you get bit twice it's

2488
01:43:59,719 --> 01:44:03,920
it's pretty serious the second time

2489
01:44:01,399 --> 01:44:07,118
around it's really

2490
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:10,440
intense so I feel for him he the true

2491
01:44:07,118 --> 01:44:13,079
warrior indeed also and YouTube probably

2492
01:44:10,439 --> 01:44:14,799
for having that and there's one I just

2493
01:44:13,079 --> 01:44:16,118
took could up to and since you guys are

2494
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:17,599
saying some stuff I just want to shine a

2495
01:44:16,118 --> 01:44:20,238
light on the subject too because I think

2496
01:44:17,599 --> 01:44:23,560
we talked a lot about the fires in

2497
01:44:20,238 --> 01:44:26,879
California and in the west coast and all

2498
01:44:23,560 --> 01:44:30,039
over United States and Canada today but

2499
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:32,319
there are big huge fires happening in

2500
01:44:30,039 --> 01:44:35,319
Brazil right now too a bit different

2501
01:44:32,319 --> 01:44:38,439
than here because it's not natural fires

2502
01:44:35,319 --> 01:44:42,079
they're all criminal fires and in the

2503
01:44:38,439 --> 01:44:43,719
highest biodiversity places in Brazil so

2504
01:44:42,079 --> 01:44:46,800
I just wanted to send some love take

2505
01:44:43,719 --> 01:44:50,560
this dab bunch of animals have died a

2506
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:52,760
bunch of animals have burned uh we

2507
01:44:50,560 --> 01:44:55,400
actually what was burned right now in

2508
01:44:52,760 --> 01:44:58,840
the last last month was over what was

2509
01:44:55,399 --> 01:45:00,598
burned in the last 20 years total so it

2510
01:44:58,840 --> 01:45:02,880
was very crazy what happened so I just

2511
01:45:00,599 --> 01:45:04,440
wanted to like to shine some love over

2512
01:45:02,880 --> 01:45:06,760
there for everyone that is here and

2513
01:45:04,439 --> 01:45:09,198
everyone that is like watching it too

2514
01:45:06,760 --> 01:45:11,920
anyone's taking a dab smoking a joint

2515
01:45:09,198 --> 01:45:14,719
just send some love and to all the

2516
01:45:11,920 --> 01:45:18,359
spirits of the fires and the winds be

2517
01:45:14,719 --> 01:45:20,198
like have mercy on all of us and just

2518
01:45:18,359 --> 01:45:22,238
like help us out so I just want to shine

2519
01:45:20,198 --> 01:45:23,839
a light on that too and just to CAD I

2520
01:45:22,238 --> 01:45:27,198
wanted to offer this

2521
01:45:23,840 --> 01:45:29,079
de very well said that's uh that's heavy

2522
01:45:27,198 --> 01:45:32,678
when you think of David attenborough's

2523
01:45:29,079 --> 01:45:34,920
quote about 94% of all mamalian life on

2524
01:45:32,679 --> 01:45:38,279
Earth is humans and the livestock that

2525
01:45:34,920 --> 01:45:40,960
they cultivate and the other 4% are all

2526
01:45:38,279 --> 01:45:43,920
the zebras and lions and wild animals

2527
01:45:40,960 --> 01:45:47,279
that live out in the forest

2528
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:49,319
4% like think of how insane that is and

2529
01:45:47,279 --> 01:45:51,519
when you have fires of this size and

2530
01:45:49,319 --> 01:45:53,599
that many animals are dying that could

2531
01:45:51,520 --> 01:45:54,920
literally be like half a

2532
01:45:53,599 --> 01:45:59,880
of like the

2533
01:45:54,920 --> 01:46:01,560
4% like 20% of all animal life on Earth

2534
01:45:59,880 --> 01:46:03,920
I don't think people really understand

2535
01:46:01,560 --> 01:46:06,320
the uh the impact that that something

2536
01:46:03,920 --> 01:46:08,118
like that can have we've already you

2537
01:46:06,319 --> 01:46:11,319
know messed things up to the point where

2538
01:46:08,118 --> 01:46:13,960
cows are taking up like all of the space

2539
01:46:11,319 --> 01:46:17,158
that you know wild animals used to take

2540
01:46:13,960 --> 01:46:19,158
up it's it's pretty messed up that's

2541
01:46:17,158 --> 01:46:21,359
it's insane in Brazil that's what's

2542
01:46:19,158 --> 01:46:23,439
going on Marcus that's exactly it they

2543
01:46:21,359 --> 01:46:26,399
burn all the land so they can either

2544
01:46:23,439 --> 01:46:29,919
plant soy to feed cows or just to have

2545
01:46:26,399 --> 01:46:34,079
cows over there it's of course totally

2546
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:36,599
criminal action uh it's a it's a direct

2547
01:46:34,079 --> 01:46:39,118
result from a lack of state that we have

2548
01:46:36,599 --> 01:46:41,400
and from everyone that being everyone

2549
01:46:39,118 --> 01:46:44,439
political being careful with like our

2550
01:46:41,399 --> 01:46:46,879
our environment and it's just very very

2551
01:46:44,439 --> 01:46:48,638
very sad it's not even modern nature you

2552
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:51,520
know it's like a land that it's not

2553
01:46:48,639 --> 01:46:53,480
usually burned so when it burns it burns

2554
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:55,360
it's not like you rebut

2555
01:46:53,479 --> 01:46:58,039
like because it's

2556
01:46:55,359 --> 01:47:00,719
like think of what's fueling that what's

2557
01:46:58,039 --> 01:47:02,118
fueling that is human beings desires to

2558
01:47:00,719 --> 01:47:05,920
consume

2559
01:47:02,118 --> 01:47:08,439
flesh how about that for a thought yeah

2560
01:47:05,920 --> 01:47:10,319
that's an insatiable appetite there's

2561
01:47:08,439 --> 01:47:12,000
just you never want to stop eating it

2562
01:47:10,319 --> 01:47:13,399
it's like you can't make enough Burgers

2563
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:15,359
you can't feed enough of the world's

2564
01:47:13,399 --> 01:47:17,519
grain Supply and enough of the clean

2565
01:47:15,359 --> 01:47:19,598
water just give it to the cows give them

2566
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:22,440
the rainforest cut kill everything else

2567
01:47:19,599 --> 01:47:24,360
cut everything else down I need my

2568
01:47:22,439 --> 01:47:25,919
burger

2569
01:47:24,359 --> 01:47:27,960
[ __ ]

2570
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:31,880
yep yeah it

2571
01:47:27,960 --> 01:47:33,520
is so that's all sh some love so I have

2572
01:47:31,880 --> 01:47:37,639
a

2573
01:47:33,520 --> 01:47:41,920
picture I have a picture of these

2574
01:47:37,639 --> 01:47:43,880
rotting birch logs behind me because

2575
01:47:41,920 --> 01:47:46,440
we're putting these in the earth and

2576
01:47:43,880 --> 01:47:48,599
growing weed on top of them at at a

2577
01:47:46,439 --> 01:47:51,158
friends at out of some family and here

2578
01:47:48,599 --> 01:47:53,199
in the cies building a new farm and

2579
01:47:51,158 --> 01:47:55,638
creating uh you know hugle cult culture

2580
01:47:53,198 --> 01:47:58,279
and and putting the logs in the earth so

2581
01:47:55,639 --> 01:48:00,239
they can last because all these fires

2582
01:47:58,279 --> 01:48:01,960
just burn up everything and it goes into

2583
01:48:00,238 --> 01:48:04,638
the atmosphere it's gone forever it

2584
01:48:01,960 --> 01:48:07,880
doesn't become microbes it doesn't

2585
01:48:04,639 --> 01:48:10,079
become long life forever and you know I

2586
01:48:07,880 --> 01:48:13,400
just again want to encourage people to

2587
01:48:10,079 --> 01:48:15,639
put wood in the earth and sequester the

2588
01:48:13,399 --> 01:48:18,359
carbon for as long as possible in the

2589
01:48:15,639 --> 01:48:19,920
earth and uh you know it's it's crazy

2590
01:48:18,359 --> 01:48:22,198
what's happening with fires in the case

2591
01:48:19,920 --> 01:48:23,840
of Southern Oregon in Medford it's

2592
01:48:22,198 --> 01:48:25,519
amazing

2593
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:29,199
I really feel for the Rogue Valley I

2594
01:48:25,520 --> 01:48:31,599
mean the fire ripped through an urban

2595
01:48:29,198 --> 01:48:33,198
area like you were talking Wade like

2596
01:48:31,599 --> 01:48:35,599
paradise I mean we're talking from

2597
01:48:33,198 --> 01:48:40,118
Ashland all the way through to Medford

2598
01:48:35,599 --> 01:48:44,079
10 miles of all towns Phoenix and talent

2599
01:48:40,118 --> 01:48:46,598
I mean massive 3,000 Helms I think

2600
01:48:44,079 --> 01:48:49,319
that's right some thousands of homes

2601
01:48:46,599 --> 01:48:52,159
were were taken out down there and uh in

2602
01:48:49,319 --> 01:48:56,039
teila and Southern Oregon they really

2603
01:48:52,158 --> 01:48:57,719
mobilized as a community and really did

2604
01:48:56,039 --> 01:48:59,880
a great job of protecting their

2605
01:48:57,719 --> 01:49:02,560
Community um from the fire from Happy

2606
01:48:59,880 --> 01:49:05,279
Camp that was coming over um so

2607
01:49:02,560 --> 01:49:08,599
incredible mobilizations have happened

2608
01:49:05,279 --> 01:49:10,639
from people so you know um it's it's

2609
01:49:08,599 --> 01:49:13,480
pretty powerful and I know Wendy from

2610
01:49:10,639 --> 01:49:16,599
sunbus obviously couldn't make it

2611
01:49:13,479 --> 01:49:17,839
today oh I I thought she's maybe she is

2612
01:49:16,599 --> 01:49:21,000
Gonna Come on she was going to talk

2613
01:49:17,840 --> 01:49:22,239
about Ash mitigation on the flower um

2614
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:25,118
and I guess we're going to try and send

2615
01:49:22,238 --> 01:49:27,238
her a link to get her on right now um so

2616
01:49:25,118 --> 01:49:30,198
you know there was people that had the

2617
01:49:27,238 --> 01:49:33,718
fire within a half a mile of their house

2618
01:49:30,198 --> 01:49:36,039
just blazing crowning you know just

2619
01:49:33,719 --> 01:49:38,158
dropping [ __ ] on their house and stuff

2620
01:49:36,039 --> 01:49:41,238
so you know and these are people with

2621
01:49:38,158 --> 01:49:43,960
you know a good amount of weed out there

2622
01:49:41,238 --> 01:49:46,439
so um you know there's anyone who has

2623
01:49:43,960 --> 01:49:47,920
any information on ash mitigation Colin

2624
01:49:46,439 --> 01:49:49,799
have you ever had to deal with that or

2625
01:49:47,920 --> 01:49:51,920
do you know anyone since you're on right

2626
01:49:49,800 --> 01:49:53,920
now um yeah so I have some friends that

2627
01:49:51,920 --> 01:49:56,440
are that are out there um everyone's

2628
01:49:53,920 --> 01:49:58,599
using uh blowers don't you don't want to

2629
01:49:56,439 --> 01:50:02,158
wet your plants down ever you you really

2630
01:49:58,599 --> 01:50:03,880
want to to to refrain from doing that um

2631
01:50:02,158 --> 01:50:07,118
you just want to go out there and try to

2632
01:50:03,880 --> 01:50:09,199
keep it um dry if you can put some hoops

2633
01:50:07,118 --> 01:50:10,920
up try to put some hoops up but don't

2634
01:50:09,198 --> 01:50:15,079
put anything that's flammable because

2635
01:50:10,920 --> 01:50:17,760
that could cause other problems um you

2636
01:50:15,079 --> 01:50:19,960
know it's uh you just got to be diligent

2637
01:50:17,760 --> 01:50:21,920
and be on it and be patient and and

2638
01:50:19,960 --> 01:50:24,118
really you know keep air flows you as

2639
01:50:21,920 --> 01:50:27,039
much as you can I've heard two friends

2640
01:50:24,118 --> 01:50:29,079
are putting fans out there with Jenny's

2641
01:50:27,039 --> 01:50:31,359
um to try to get air flow through the

2642
01:50:29,079 --> 01:50:34,559
through the uh through the rows to try

2643
01:50:31,359 --> 01:50:37,039
to just uh help mitigate things and you

2644
01:50:34,560 --> 01:50:39,239
know just doing your best that's but uh

2645
01:50:37,039 --> 01:50:43,279
in terms of uh just ash mitigation is

2646
01:50:39,238 --> 01:50:46,439
just blowers um and uh and

2647
01:50:43,279 --> 01:50:48,920
fans and uh if you're in a greenhouse

2648
01:50:46,439 --> 01:50:51,839
too you can if you have the ability to

2649
01:50:48,920 --> 01:50:54,560
run power to it use maybe a carbon

2650
01:50:51,840 --> 01:50:56,319
filter and fan so that the air you're

2651
01:50:54,560 --> 01:50:58,119
pushing in is clean and you have

2652
01:50:56,319 --> 01:51:00,319
positive pressure in the greenhouse so

2653
01:50:58,118 --> 01:51:02,839
you're not drawing Ash into the

2654
01:51:00,319 --> 01:51:05,840
greenhouse yeah but for full terms you

2655
01:51:02,840 --> 01:51:08,078
know that's just tough

2656
01:51:05,840 --> 01:51:10,000
yeah that's one of the reasons why we

2657
01:51:08,078 --> 01:51:12,238
grow in green houses here in this area

2658
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:14,719
is not only from rain and all that but

2659
01:51:12,238 --> 01:51:17,118
you know if if you're concerned about

2660
01:51:14,719 --> 01:51:19,599
chem chem trails or things you know even

2661
01:51:17,118 --> 01:51:21,519
metals from the sky you know you can I

2662
01:51:19,599 --> 01:51:23,440
also totally agree with growing Outdoors

2663
01:51:21,520 --> 01:51:27,199
Under the Sun you know but there's a lot

2664
01:51:23,439 --> 01:51:29,919
of reasons more and more to have a cover

2665
01:51:27,198 --> 01:51:32,759
I think it's even possible with Outdoors

2666
01:51:29,920 --> 01:51:34,520
is to to even it to put a shade cloth I

2667
01:51:32,760 --> 01:51:37,719
know you don't want to shade your plants

2668
01:51:34,520 --> 01:51:40,480
when it's already Smoky but some type of

2669
01:51:37,719 --> 01:51:43,319
cloth that can go over the top of your

2670
01:51:40,479 --> 01:51:44,879
plants that can stop ash from falling on

2671
01:51:43,319 --> 01:51:47,158
it could be really useful you could use

2672
01:51:44,880 --> 01:51:48,760
tea steaks if they you know with bamboo

2673
01:51:47,158 --> 01:51:51,559
on the top and then put you know even

2674
01:51:48,760 --> 01:51:53,280
just a horizontal cloth over your plants

2675
01:51:51,560 --> 01:51:55,159
and maybe you'd only have to do that for

2676
01:51:53,279 --> 01:51:57,920
a week when the ash is really falling

2677
01:51:55,158 --> 01:52:00,238
heavy in the case of Oregon um they had

2678
01:51:57,920 --> 01:52:04,359
a really heavy duty

2679
01:52:00,238 --> 01:52:07,198
rainstorm right on the tail of all those

2680
01:52:04,359 --> 01:52:11,158
those uh heavy so they they had that

2681
01:52:07,198 --> 01:52:14,598
week of million Acres burn type thing

2682
01:52:11,158 --> 01:52:17,439
and then got you know a heavy rainstorm

2683
01:52:14,599 --> 01:52:20,719
on it you know maybe in the case of

2684
01:52:17,439 --> 01:52:24,519
rain potentially that could actually

2685
01:52:20,719 --> 01:52:24,520
wash it through rather than just turn

2686
01:52:25,800 --> 01:52:31,239
mud and I haven't had too many um

2687
01:52:29,279 --> 01:52:33,000
conversations with people that have have

2688
01:52:31,238 --> 01:52:33,718
have reported anything negative from

2689
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,760
that

2690
01:52:33,719 --> 01:52:37,078
rainstorm um but you know maybe if

2691
01:52:35,760 --> 01:52:39,079
you're trying to wash it with like a

2692
01:52:37,078 --> 01:52:40,719
spray or a hose it's a lot different but

2693
01:52:39,078 --> 01:52:42,399
I guess with nature with the rains I

2694
01:52:40,719 --> 01:52:44,880
think in this case it may have actually

2695
01:52:42,399 --> 01:52:46,359
done okay but um that's really good to

2696
01:52:44,880 --> 01:52:50,239
hear hopefully Wendy

2697
01:52:46,359 --> 01:52:52,158
can yeah yeah because the that carbon I

2698
01:52:50,238 --> 01:52:54,678
don't know I I think Dr Mark could

2699
01:52:52,158 --> 01:52:56,679
probably talk about uh Mark you could

2700
01:52:54,679 --> 01:53:00,520
probably chime in on on what Ash might

2701
01:52:56,679 --> 01:53:02,399
or might not do a bit more chemically

2702
01:53:00,520 --> 01:53:03,920
than anyone

2703
01:53:02,399 --> 01:53:06,759
hereon

2704
01:53:03,920 --> 01:53:09,800
come it's gonna flavor the plants right

2705
01:53:06,760 --> 01:53:13,599
it's just GNA give it like a smokey

2706
01:53:09,800 --> 01:53:16,480
flavor and I think I I remember uh when

2707
01:53:13,599 --> 01:53:18,679
we had fires a couple years ago we had

2708
01:53:16,479 --> 01:53:22,078
some people on hash Church who are

2709
01:53:18,679 --> 01:53:26,199
discussing uh Smoky flavor in some of

2710
01:53:22,078 --> 01:53:28,039
the extracts and the water hash uh who

2711
01:53:26,198 --> 01:53:30,279
was that Marcus so I'm trying to

2712
01:53:28,039 --> 01:53:32,599
remember we this may have been like

2713
01:53:30,279 --> 01:53:34,000
about two or three years ago on hash

2714
01:53:32,599 --> 01:53:37,319
church and there were

2715
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:40,479
fires and um we were talking about this

2716
01:53:37,319 --> 01:53:43,719
very issue and whether or not it comes

2717
01:53:40,479 --> 01:53:45,879
through and extracts um again you could

2718
01:53:43,719 --> 01:53:47,880
probably clean it out of the distillate

2719
01:53:45,880 --> 01:53:49,639
that's probably not I think that's the

2720
01:53:47,880 --> 01:53:52,880
only way honestly I've never seen it

2721
01:53:49,639 --> 01:53:55,639
come out any other way it's it's totally

2722
01:53:52,880 --> 01:53:57,800
R marus do you remember who we had on

2723
01:53:55,639 --> 01:54:00,039
that we were talking to this about do

2724
01:53:57,800 --> 01:54:01,800
you remember this off the top of my head

2725
01:54:00,039 --> 01:54:04,039
there's been so many people that have

2726
01:54:01,800 --> 01:54:06,360
been on over the years like we probably

2727
01:54:04,039 --> 01:54:09,158
are over a hundred different

2728
01:54:06,359 --> 01:54:11,078
people yeah I seem to remember that what

2729
01:54:09,158 --> 01:54:14,399
we were talking about again is that you

2730
01:54:11,078 --> 01:54:17,599
know again a lot of folks who grow not

2731
01:54:14,399 --> 01:54:21,279
necessarily for oil markets or for

2732
01:54:17,599 --> 01:54:22,920
extraction who growth or flower markets

2733
01:54:21,279 --> 01:54:26,599
were saying hey we can't can't sell our

2734
01:54:22,920 --> 01:54:29,920
flour can we extract it and there was a

2735
01:54:26,599 --> 01:54:32,679
whole surge of again people wanting to

2736
01:54:29,920 --> 01:54:35,199
actually get into extraction just

2737
01:54:32,679 --> 01:54:37,279
because they had to you know do

2738
01:54:35,198 --> 01:54:39,719
something to recoup the material that

2739
01:54:37,279 --> 01:54:42,719
they lost because of the

2740
01:54:39,719 --> 01:54:46,158
fire and there was a bunch of smoky

2741
01:54:42,719 --> 01:54:48,319
material on the open market back then I

2742
01:54:46,158 --> 01:54:51,479
probably take it that there will be

2743
01:54:48,319 --> 01:54:54,000
again this time and it'll be interesting

2744
01:54:51,479 --> 01:54:58,039
to see if some of these folks who track

2745
01:54:54,000 --> 01:55:01,359
it who track like uh like wholesale

2746
01:54:58,039 --> 01:55:03,599
index prices like uh cannabis benchmarks

2747
01:55:01,359 --> 01:55:05,839
for one I'm sure at&amp; you know about

2748
01:55:03,599 --> 01:55:10,360
cannabis benchmarks right so what they

2749
01:55:05,840 --> 01:55:13,078
do is that's a website that um uh uh

2750
01:55:10,359 --> 01:55:15,639
basically based on large transactions

2751
01:55:13,078 --> 01:55:18,799
with large license dispensaries they're

2752
01:55:15,639 --> 01:55:21,800
able to track the wholesale price of

2753
01:55:18,800 --> 01:55:24,000
cannabis flour and what you see is in

2754
01:55:21,800 --> 01:55:26,520
these kind kind of cases again Supply

2755
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:28,439
demand Economics work where again if

2756
01:55:26,520 --> 01:55:30,440
there's a constant Supply and all a

2757
01:55:28,439 --> 01:55:32,279
sudden the supply tightens up or it

2758
01:55:30,439 --> 01:55:35,359
doesn't smell as good and then people

2759
01:55:32,279 --> 01:55:38,359
are now extracting you know you're going

2760
01:55:35,359 --> 01:55:41,559
to see fluctuations but typically what

2761
01:55:38,359 --> 01:55:45,078
they do is they follow uh things like

2762
01:55:41,560 --> 01:55:50,079
outdoor and differentiate outdoor from

2763
01:55:45,078 --> 01:55:52,479
light dep and uh you know um indoor and

2764
01:55:50,078 --> 01:55:54,599
look at the various wholesale prices and

2765
01:55:52,479 --> 01:55:57,279
typically those numbers right 18 are

2766
01:55:54,599 --> 01:56:00,920
always around like anywhere between

2767
01:55:57,279 --> 01:56:03,559
1,200 to 1300 a pound to as much is

2768
01:56:00,920 --> 01:56:06,920
1,500 a pound and they they

2769
01:56:03,560 --> 01:56:09,000
move a little bit right but right it

2770
01:56:06,920 --> 01:56:11,800
fluctuates it's gonna go up slightly

2771
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:13,520
this year you know uh because of fires

2772
01:56:11,800 --> 01:56:16,279
and also local

2773
01:56:13,520 --> 01:56:19,119
regionalizations um and Market

2774
01:56:16,279 --> 01:56:20,920
stabilizing uh but also just because of

2775
01:56:19,118 --> 01:56:24,719
uh yeah here in California we're still

2776
01:56:20,920 --> 01:56:24,719
over taxed how's it going there in

2777
01:56:24,920 --> 01:56:32,560
PA it's still I mean you know our

2778
01:56:29,238 --> 01:56:34,598
governor wants to do legalization and

2779
01:56:32,560 --> 01:56:36,760
legalization is on the ballot in New

2780
01:56:34,599 --> 01:56:38,880
Jersey and it seems like there's going

2781
01:56:36,760 --> 01:56:41,679
to be just this domino effect between

2782
01:56:38,880 --> 01:56:44,118
New Jersey Pennsylvania and New York and

2783
01:56:41,679 --> 01:56:48,800
that legalization is just right around

2784
01:56:44,118 --> 01:56:51,118
the corner and um you know I the the

2785
01:56:48,800 --> 01:56:53,679
product in the dispensary 18 to tell you

2786
01:56:51,118 --> 01:56:55,598
the truth is pretty good and comparable

2787
01:56:53,679 --> 01:56:57,679
in terms of pricing of like what you'd

2788
01:56:55,599 --> 01:57:00,400
almost get on the black market I mean

2789
01:56:57,679 --> 01:57:02,239
certainly Black Market is still alive

2790
01:57:00,399 --> 01:57:05,000
and plentiful all throughout the East

2791
01:57:02,238 --> 01:57:07,759
Coast Black Market in New York is still

2792
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:09,158
you know it's even when legalization

2793
01:57:07,760 --> 01:57:12,400
happens I don't think it's going to go

2794
01:57:09,158 --> 01:57:14,479
away anytime soon hey can we use the

2795
01:57:12,399 --> 01:57:17,158
term can we use the term elicit Market

2796
01:57:14,479 --> 01:57:20,039
you know we're trying opposed to using

2797
01:57:17,158 --> 01:57:23,158
the term Black Market weed what about

2798
01:57:20,039 --> 01:57:25,599
traditional Market yes Trad

2799
01:57:23,158 --> 01:57:25,598
traditional

2800
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:34,639
Market Market I like traditional markets

2801
01:57:32,560 --> 01:57:36,760
y youall know what I mean but I think an

2802
01:57:34,639 --> 01:57:39,118
interesting Trend and at&amp; you could

2803
01:57:36,760 --> 01:57:41,000
probably speak to this is in California

2804
01:57:39,118 --> 01:57:43,598
you know my son's out in La now and he

2805
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:45,639
goes to dispensaries now and he's in the

2806
01:57:43,599 --> 01:57:47,199
industry extracting so he's seeing a

2807
01:57:45,639 --> 01:57:50,039
little bit of this dynamic in the

2808
01:57:47,198 --> 01:57:53,238
marketplace which is uh the popularity

2809
01:57:50,039 --> 01:57:56,479
of beverages he says that going to be

2810
01:57:53,238 --> 01:58:00,799
going to um dispensaries and buying

2811
01:57:56,479 --> 01:58:04,238
beverages by the cases you know like

2812
01:58:00,800 --> 01:58:05,800
these fruity limey whatever beverages I

2813
01:58:04,238 --> 01:58:07,598
think there's all kinds of new products

2814
01:58:05,800 --> 01:58:09,000
that are out there in the market but uh

2815
01:58:07,599 --> 01:58:11,199
I guess that being a new category and

2816
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:13,560
again not something necessarily you can

2817
01:58:11,198 --> 01:58:16,919
make at home right unless you're making

2818
01:58:13,560 --> 01:58:18,280
your own soda or taking an extract and I

2819
01:58:16,920 --> 01:58:21,599
don't know it would be interesting to

2820
01:58:18,279 --> 01:58:23,679
see if you can take like an extract that

2821
01:58:21,599 --> 01:58:26,239
you could buy at a dispensary and use

2822
01:58:23,679 --> 01:58:29,199
like one of those home soda makers and

2823
01:58:26,238 --> 01:58:32,959
try to make a carbonated beverage with

2824
01:58:29,198 --> 01:58:35,479
your own canabo you know I I I I don't

2825
01:58:32,960 --> 01:58:37,000
know if that would work but I mean that

2826
01:58:35,479 --> 01:58:39,479
why wouldn't it I mean everything we

2827
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:42,520
made is created by you know was created

2828
01:58:39,479 --> 01:58:44,919
by patients for patients originally so

2829
01:58:42,520 --> 01:58:47,000
but yes there is an uptake more if

2830
01:58:44,920 --> 01:58:49,880
there's an uptake in Edibles period in

2831
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:52,599
the covid era you know uh people were

2832
01:58:49,880 --> 01:58:55,279
you know we had the evoi problem

2833
01:58:52,599 --> 01:58:58,159
uh the cartridges so cartridges have

2834
01:58:55,279 --> 01:59:01,279
dips uh they're starting to come back

2835
01:58:58,158 --> 01:59:03,960
but you know flowers and definitely

2836
01:59:01,279 --> 01:59:06,000
Edibles and concentrates too people have

2837
01:59:03,960 --> 01:59:08,078
a lot of time to sit around apparently

2838
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:10,760
so we've seen an uptick definitely in

2839
01:59:08,078 --> 01:59:13,439
the quality as well of the the rosin

2840
01:59:10,760 --> 01:59:15,599
we've had access to and uh natural

2841
01:59:13,439 --> 01:59:17,598
extractions as well as the extracted

2842
01:59:15,599 --> 01:59:19,880
products are definitely getting better

2843
01:59:17,599 --> 01:59:21,800
the quality of the flow is still not to

2844
01:59:19,880 --> 01:59:24,400
where I want it to be for the price

2845
01:59:21,800 --> 01:59:26,800
point I still think it's about two price

2846
01:59:24,399 --> 01:59:29,158
points higher than it should be uh

2847
01:59:26,800 --> 01:59:33,880
compared to when I was actually dealing

2848
01:59:29,158 --> 01:59:36,158
internally of selection Etc so I thought

2849
01:59:33,880 --> 01:59:40,599
the market corrected itself better in

2850
01:59:36,158 --> 01:59:43,920
Nevada and California it's still too um

2851
01:59:40,599 --> 01:59:47,719
production for my uh expectation there

2852
01:59:43,920 --> 01:59:50,078
are some some quality uh uh craft

2853
01:59:47,719 --> 01:59:52,279
Growers uh but this is the problem with

2854
01:59:50,078 --> 01:59:54,158
the fires the craft Growers of the ones

2855
01:59:52,279 --> 01:59:56,639
that are being hit very hard where as

2856
01:59:54,158 --> 01:59:59,198
opposed to most of the indoor production

2857
01:59:56,639 --> 02:00:02,639
is going on without any type of problem

2858
01:59:59,198 --> 02:00:04,118
but the Exotic Outdoors [ __ ] man it

2859
02:00:02,639 --> 02:00:07,118
pisses me off it's challenging and

2860
02:00:04,118 --> 02:00:08,399
painful to see uh the loss because one

2861
02:00:07,118 --> 02:00:10,920
of my main suppliers like I said

2862
02:00:08,399 --> 02:00:14,158
Foxworthy Farm You Know M Martin and

2863
02:00:10,920 --> 02:00:16,118
them lost access or had problems prior

2864
02:00:14,158 --> 02:00:19,559
they were able to save some and get some

2865
02:00:16,118 --> 02:00:21,679
out as the fires were encroaching but

2866
02:00:19,560 --> 02:00:24,440
have to see how it's harvested and you

2867
02:00:21,679 --> 02:00:26,639
know dry to see exactly the quality of

2868
02:00:24,439 --> 02:00:28,559
what it'll be so a lot of people are

2869
02:00:26,639 --> 02:00:30,760
dealing with this reality right now and

2870
02:00:28,560 --> 02:00:33,520
it's it's frustrating and it's sad to

2871
02:00:30,760 --> 02:00:35,440
see on top of that fire season ain't

2872
02:00:33,520 --> 02:00:37,760
over you know we're still in the midst

2873
02:00:35,439 --> 02:00:40,000
of it here so you know blessings to

2874
02:00:37,760 --> 02:00:43,119
everybody and to all of you stay safe

2875
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:46,118
stay sound stay uh wet as much as

2876
02:00:43,118 --> 02:00:48,559
possible keep it damp out there talk you

2877
02:00:46,118 --> 02:00:53,920
were talking about markets I just wanted

2878
02:00:48,560 --> 02:00:53,920
to say black markets matter

2879
02:00:55,639 --> 02:01:02,199
black blim oh that is so

2880
02:00:58,560 --> 02:01:02,199
not could be too

2881
02:01:03,599 --> 02:01:08,880
soon one thing the one thing that's for

2882
02:01:06,319 --> 02:01:10,920
sure is that there's a lot more there's

2883
02:01:08,880 --> 02:01:14,960
a lot more processing

2884
02:01:10,920 --> 02:01:18,760
capability today uh than just simply

2885
02:01:14,960 --> 02:01:21,198
like two or three years ago so that

2886
02:01:18,760 --> 02:01:24,239
process capability see the dog agrees

2887
02:01:21,198 --> 02:01:26,359
with me that that processing capability

2888
02:01:24,238 --> 02:01:29,598
means that there's now people who are

2889
02:01:26,359 --> 02:01:31,839
doing toll processing in cannabis so you

2890
02:01:29,599 --> 02:01:33,679
can grow cannabis legally you can bring

2891
02:01:31,840 --> 02:01:37,039
it to a p processor and they can make

2892
02:01:33,679 --> 02:01:39,960
oil for you so that's kind of cool the

2893
02:01:37,039 --> 02:01:41,439
other thing is that you know in hemp you

2894
02:01:39,960 --> 02:01:45,480
know we were talking a little bit about

2895
02:01:41,439 --> 02:01:47,598
this before you know I mean that bill

2896
02:01:45,479 --> 02:01:48,519
that's in Congress right now which is

2897
02:01:47,599 --> 02:01:52,599
the

2898
02:01:48,520 --> 02:01:57,119
8178 I think which is the thing that's

2899
02:01:52,599 --> 02:01:59,199
going to basically regulate CBD as a

2900
02:01:57,118 --> 02:02:01,839
dietary supplement this just totally

2901
02:01:59,198 --> 02:02:04,839
needs to happen because right now the

2902
02:02:01,840 --> 02:02:07,239
painful thing that epidex has done is it

2903
02:02:04,840 --> 02:02:09,960
put CBD on a list of being an active

2904
02:02:07,238 --> 02:02:13,078
ingredient of an FDA prooved drug and

2905
02:02:09,960 --> 02:02:16,118
you can't put active ingredients in food

2906
02:02:13,078 --> 02:02:19,439
or Cosmetics or dog food so what's going

2907
02:02:16,118 --> 02:02:21,559
to enable that is this this this thing

2908
02:02:19,439 --> 02:02:26,598
that I pulled up the thing just on my

2909
02:02:21,560 --> 02:02:29,480
computer for a second now um was

2910
02:02:26,599 --> 02:02:32,440
the uh act that's currently in I think

2911
02:02:29,479 --> 02:02:33,678
it's called 8178 it's either blumau or

2912
02:02:32,439 --> 02:02:36,198
the other guy from Oregon who's

2913
02:02:33,679 --> 02:02:38,840
basically put this thing forward

2914
02:02:36,198 --> 02:02:40,960
supposedly even Mitch McConnell wants

2915
02:02:38,840 --> 02:02:43,400
this to happen so again that's sort of

2916
02:02:40,960 --> 02:02:45,399
like the gate unfortunately in our

2917
02:02:43,399 --> 02:02:47,439
government of whether or not things are

2918
02:02:45,399 --> 02:02:49,879
actually going to get voted on is the

2919
02:02:47,439 --> 02:02:51,598
head guy in the Senate has to be okay

2920
02:02:49,880 --> 02:02:52,480
with it to bring it to the floor for a

2921
02:02:51,599 --> 02:02:55,199
vote

2922
02:02:52,479 --> 02:02:56,919
supposedly they have bipartisan uh

2923
02:02:55,198 --> 02:03:00,238
support of this but what this is going

2924
02:02:56,920 --> 02:03:03,199
to do is this is going to carve CBD out

2925
02:03:00,238 --> 02:03:05,879
of the process that um you were talking

2926
02:03:03,198 --> 02:03:08,638
about before the indd process which is

2927
02:03:05,880 --> 02:03:11,920
an investigational new drug thing with

2928
02:03:08,639 --> 02:03:13,920
the FDA you know they want to carve it

2929
02:03:11,920 --> 02:03:16,800
out and put it into the dietary

2930
02:03:13,920 --> 02:03:19,599
supplement thing kind of like the kol or

2931
02:03:16,800 --> 02:03:21,840
the vitamin C or the other things that

2932
02:03:19,599 --> 02:03:24,199
you could extract from Plants put it

2933
02:03:21,840 --> 02:03:26,760
into a capsule or how about that [ __ ]

2934
02:03:24,198 --> 02:03:29,439
Prevagen what the [ __ ] is that right

2935
02:03:26,760 --> 02:03:31,960
some thing from a jellyfish they extract

2936
02:03:29,439 --> 02:03:33,919
jelly fish put it into a capsule give it

2937
02:03:31,960 --> 02:03:36,920
to senior citizens and now it all a

2938
02:03:33,920 --> 02:03:39,880
sudden improves their memory I mean what

2939
02:03:36,920 --> 02:03:43,719
the [ __ ] is that you know Prevagen right

2940
02:03:39,880 --> 02:03:46,319
so I mean that's the category that CBD

2941
02:03:43,719 --> 02:03:49,158
and and tobacco actually all belong in

2942
02:03:46,319 --> 02:03:51,118
or maybe not tobacco but um but what do

2943
02:03:49,158 --> 02:03:53,399
you think of that interm rule the DEA

2944
02:03:51,118 --> 02:03:55,198
did recently on the hemp farm bill and

2945
02:03:53,399 --> 02:03:58,279
don't you know the way it kind of opens

2946
02:03:55,198 --> 02:04:00,678
up for GW because there's a thing in

2947
02:03:58,279 --> 02:04:03,880
there that says anyone with FDA uh

2948
02:04:00,679 --> 02:04:06,520
approved products correct we no longer

2949
02:04:03,880 --> 02:04:09,159
have to use have permits or licensing

2950
02:04:06,520 --> 02:04:10,800
for import or export I'm like listen

2951
02:04:09,158 --> 02:04:13,359
like these guys are getting ready to

2952
02:04:10,800 --> 02:04:16,960
clear the inter okay so what the interim

2953
02:04:13,359 --> 02:04:19,039
final ruling is is an attempt by the DEA

2954
02:04:16,960 --> 02:04:21,719
to harmonize the controll dangerous

2955
02:04:19,039 --> 02:04:23,760
substance act with the American

2956
02:04:21,719 --> 02:04:25,920
agriculture Improvement act aka the farm

2957
02:04:23,760 --> 02:04:29,520
bill right so the farm bill basically

2958
02:04:25,920 --> 02:04:32,520
says if it's below 3 THC and the plant

2959
02:04:29,520 --> 02:04:34,760
it's legal it's hemp high five go grow

2960
02:04:32,520 --> 02:04:37,840
your hemp right they forgot that as soon

2961
02:04:34,760 --> 02:04:41,000
as you Buck those hemp plants and you

2962
02:04:37,840 --> 02:04:43,679
take not the entire plant at0 three now

2963
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:46,800
you take the more ENT parts of the plant

2964
02:04:43,679 --> 02:04:50,599
as soon as you trim it to extract it to

2965
02:04:46,800 --> 02:04:52,239
distill it to isolate it oh way over

2966
02:04:50,599 --> 02:04:55,400
yeah well except the is if you're

2967
02:04:52,238 --> 02:04:57,279
talking about CBD isolation portion but

2968
02:04:55,399 --> 02:04:59,399
the dirty secret is is again we talked

2969
02:04:57,279 --> 02:05:03,039
about this on hash Church a couple times

2970
02:04:59,399 --> 02:05:05,839
at .3% in a typical yield of these high

2971
02:05:03,039 --> 02:05:08,238
yielding varieties like lifter and

2972
02:05:05,840 --> 02:05:11,840
cherry wine and whatnot box and all

2973
02:05:08,238 --> 02:05:15,000
those uh on a typical yield of of acre

2974
02:05:11,840 --> 02:05:17,440
of hemp if you grow like a drug Variety

2975
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:21,679
in in a drug variety kind of way that's

2976
02:05:17,439 --> 02:05:23,519
almost like five pounds of TC per acre

2977
02:05:21,679 --> 02:05:27,000
it's a lot of THC right that's what I'm

2978
02:05:23,520 --> 02:05:29,239
saying it's a lot yeah and so they never

2979
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:32,000
you know gez the intellectual furnaces

2980
02:05:29,238 --> 02:05:35,039
weren't burning hard enough to realize

2981
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:36,960
that well even if we regulate this stuff

2982
02:05:35,039 --> 02:05:39,599
and put this stuff as0 three in the

2983
02:05:36,960 --> 02:05:41,840
plant that every step along the way

2984
02:05:39,599 --> 02:05:44,159
until you're in the diluted you know

2985
02:05:41,840 --> 02:05:46,760
tincture obviously the diluted tincture

2986
02:05:44,158 --> 02:05:49,319
is back down the point three or whatever

2987
02:05:46,760 --> 02:05:51,880
it was in the plant but everything along

2988
02:05:49,319 --> 02:05:55,198
the way which is called working in

2989
02:05:51,880 --> 02:05:57,400
progress hemp extract is all is all

2990
02:05:55,198 --> 02:06:00,519
basically illegal just based on the

2991
02:05:57,399 --> 02:06:03,118
amount of of of THC and the whole Del

2992
02:06:00,520 --> 02:06:06,800
not only that Mark but the truth of it

2993
02:06:03,118 --> 02:06:10,598
is if you have a high CBD variety that's

2994
02:06:06,800 --> 02:06:13,599
over 10% the odds are it's hot if you

2995
02:06:10,599 --> 02:06:17,920
let it mature because

2996
02:06:13,599 --> 02:06:22,520
CBD synthesis produce about a 25 to1

2997
02:06:17,920 --> 02:06:24,880
ratio of THC yeah yeah yeah Sam I I was

2998
02:06:22,520 --> 02:06:26,840
in a field yesterday just right down the

2999
02:06:24,880 --> 02:06:29,520
road here in Maryland that's growing a

3000
02:06:26,840 --> 02:06:33,920
high CBG variety of something called

3001
02:06:29,520 --> 02:06:37,000
lifter and there is no THC in that

3002
02:06:33,920 --> 02:06:39,440
variety at all zero none zil I can

3003
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:39,439
second that

3004
02:06:39,559 --> 02:06:44,599
Mark it's got It's got about one or two

3005
02:06:42,359 --> 02:06:48,759
per in dry weight it's got about one or

3006
02:06:44,599 --> 02:06:50,520
two perc CBD but it's got like about

3007
02:06:48,760 --> 02:06:53,760
18%

3008
02:06:50,520 --> 02:06:57,559
cbga so it's completely got all of its

3009
02:06:53,760 --> 02:07:01,760
syntheses shut down at least after after

3010
02:06:57,559 --> 02:07:05,400
what the the got the the the geranial

3011
02:07:01,760 --> 02:07:08,159
alic transferal phosphatase whatever the

3012
02:07:05,399 --> 02:07:11,078
thing that puts together cbga but all

3013
02:07:08,158 --> 02:07:15,759
the other syntheses that either make

3014
02:07:11,078 --> 02:07:17,960
cbca or thca or you know cbda we're

3015
02:07:15,760 --> 02:07:20,440
we're all basically shut down in that

3016
02:07:17,960 --> 02:07:22,399
variety so I'm really interested to see

3017
02:07:20,439 --> 02:07:25,118
what that's like I have a small nug of

3018
02:07:22,399 --> 02:07:28,238
it downstairs I'm drying it I want

3019
02:07:25,118 --> 02:07:30,000
to smoke it people have asked me they're

3020
02:07:28,238 --> 02:07:31,519
like What's that like when you smok I

3021
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:35,559
don't

3022
02:07:31,520 --> 02:07:39,639
know I was gonna extract CG we developed

3023
02:07:35,559 --> 02:07:43,079
High CBG varieties more than 15 years

3024
02:07:39,639 --> 02:07:46,719
ago what what kind of level I mean 15%

3025
02:07:43,078 --> 02:07:49,840
that's pretty it's pretty high right

3026
02:07:46,719 --> 02:07:54,118
that's pretty high I agree and ours also

3027
02:07:49,840 --> 02:07:58,000
had little to no THC at all but you

3028
02:07:54,118 --> 02:08:00,679
don't smoke CBG for recreational

3029
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:02,760
purposes yeah yeah so how does it make

3030
02:08:00,679 --> 02:08:06,719
you feel does it make you feel high or

3031
02:08:02,760 --> 02:08:10,159
relaxed or not not at all I but then I

3032
02:08:06,719 --> 02:08:13,439
don't like CBD I don't like CBG I don't

3033
02:08:10,158 --> 02:08:16,638
like CBC none of them get me high and I

3034
02:08:13,439 --> 02:08:20,158
don't like them I smoked get high not to

3035
02:08:16,639 --> 02:08:23,719
get healthy because I'm already

3036
02:08:20,158 --> 02:08:25,719
healthy did just crushed Co out in 24

3037
02:08:23,719 --> 02:08:28,520
hours how about

3038
02:08:25,719 --> 02:08:32,118
that and he's patented it

3039
02:08:28,520 --> 02:08:34,960
probably Mark uh I've been uh I've been

3040
02:08:32,118 --> 02:08:40,399
dry sifting some CBG and it's it's

3041
02:08:34,960 --> 02:08:43,719
really uh a nice resin to work with it

3042
02:08:40,399 --> 02:08:48,759
produces it's unlike CBD where it's um

3043
02:08:43,719 --> 02:08:51,520
very viscous and very low yielding and

3044
02:08:48,760 --> 02:08:53,280
um typically a lot darker in Amber and

3045
02:08:51,520 --> 02:08:55,559
by Nature it's for some reason so what's

3046
02:08:53,279 --> 02:08:58,158
a full melt what's a full melt dab of

3047
02:08:55,559 --> 02:09:01,520
that like I mean what is that what I

3048
02:08:58,158 --> 02:09:04,039
feel just to me the the the feeling I

3049
02:09:01,520 --> 02:09:06,199
get from it when I'm at at kind of base

3050
02:09:04,039 --> 02:09:10,920
level which still has I still have Delta

3051
02:09:06,198 --> 02:09:12,799
9 in my system um I feel kind of relaxed

3052
02:09:10,920 --> 02:09:15,639
um if I'm really in tune with myself and

3053
02:09:12,800 --> 02:09:17,719
I think individuals that are more

3054
02:09:15,639 --> 02:09:19,920
sensitive to canono and minor canono

3055
02:09:17,719 --> 02:09:23,279
that don't have as much Delta 9 in their

3056
02:09:19,920 --> 02:09:26,679
system feel a bit more sedated from it

3057
02:09:23,279 --> 02:09:28,599
um that's what I commonly hear um so

3058
02:09:26,679 --> 02:09:30,399
there's you know it's it is still very

3059
02:09:28,599 --> 02:09:33,199
individual and that's it's still

3060
02:09:30,399 --> 02:09:35,158
anecdotal at best right now um how

3061
02:09:33,198 --> 02:09:37,279
everyone's kind of tapping into it but

3062
02:09:35,158 --> 02:09:39,759
there is I see a lot of Promise it's

3063
02:09:37,279 --> 02:09:41,639
from the extraction side I think it's

3064
02:09:39,760 --> 02:09:43,199
it's really desirable I think I'm I'm

3065
02:09:41,639 --> 02:09:44,159
really curious to see what what I can do

3066
02:09:43,198 --> 02:09:47,799
with some fresh

3067
02:09:44,158 --> 02:09:51,638
frozen well we developed it 15 years ago

3068
02:09:47,800 --> 02:09:54,320
for medicinal use absolutely but we

3069
02:09:51,639 --> 02:09:59,559
tried it for recreational use and like

3070
02:09:54,319 --> 02:10:03,519
THC pure thcv varieties or CBG varieties

3071
02:09:59,559 --> 02:10:07,000
or CBD or CBC they don't really have

3072
02:10:03,520 --> 02:10:10,159
true recreational value uh I mean some

3073
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:12,719
people will say CBD calms you down and

3074
02:10:10,158 --> 02:10:15,238
okay but that's not getting you ripping

3075
02:10:12,719 --> 02:10:18,158
High which is what I what about together

3076
02:10:15,238 --> 02:10:20,198
um Sam like what about all of these

3077
02:10:18,158 --> 02:10:22,920
major and minor cannabinoids together at

3078
02:10:20,198 --> 02:10:25,399
various levels would you agree that you

3079
02:10:22,920 --> 02:10:28,078
know removing removing one of them would

3080
02:10:25,399 --> 02:10:31,960
change that expence not tried them all

3081
02:10:28,078 --> 02:10:35,158
but of course everybody's tried uh equal

3082
02:10:31,960 --> 02:10:37,960
mixtures of CBD and THC because all of

3083
02:10:35,158 --> 02:10:42,839
the imported sifted hash traditionally

3084
02:10:37,960 --> 02:10:46,078
was a mixture of THC and CBD sure

3085
02:10:42,840 --> 02:10:48,719
there's some arguments out that the

3086
02:10:46,078 --> 02:10:51,759
cannabinoid synthes in terms of the

3087
02:10:48,719 --> 02:10:53,960
Entourage effect you know the

3088
02:10:51,760 --> 02:10:57,079
General subject that we kind of touch on

3089
02:10:53,960 --> 02:11:00,800
you know to remove one percentage of

3090
02:10:57,078 --> 02:11:03,118
let's say CBC or CBG from a you know

3091
02:11:00,800 --> 02:11:06,079
cultivar profile which completely

3092
02:11:03,118 --> 02:11:07,519
reshape the experience of that cultivar

3093
02:11:06,078 --> 02:11:08,558
you know same thing on the on the

3094
02:11:07,520 --> 02:11:12,360
turpine

3095
02:11:08,559 --> 02:11:14,360
synthes um so it's I don't know if

3096
02:11:12,359 --> 02:11:16,439
anyone has any thoughts on that but it's

3097
02:11:14,359 --> 02:11:19,000
it's it's something that I've I've been

3098
02:11:16,439 --> 02:11:22,158
kind of thinking about lately I

3099
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:24,599
traditionally read High th

3100
02:11:22,158 --> 02:11:27,399
varieties for recreational now when I

3101
02:11:24,599 --> 02:11:29,800
was interested in medicinal varieties we

3102
02:11:27,399 --> 02:11:36,519
created the world's first CBD only

3103
02:11:29,800 --> 02:11:40,599
variety the same thing with CBC CBG thcv

3104
02:11:36,520 --> 02:11:42,800
we we did all those uh but they were not

3105
02:11:40,599 --> 02:11:45,239
for recreational use they were for

3106
02:11:42,800 --> 02:11:48,159
medicinal

3107
02:11:45,238 --> 02:11:50,118
use yeah I see I use the full cannaboid

3108
02:11:48,158 --> 02:11:51,879
spectrum so I mix all my water

3109
02:11:50,118 --> 02:11:52,839
concentrates together

3110
02:11:51,880 --> 02:11:56,719
uh and

3111
02:11:52,840 --> 02:11:59,039
sees and then I put all my bhos Etc

3112
02:11:56,719 --> 02:12:01,719
together and mix them because for me

3113
02:11:59,039 --> 02:12:03,279
that's work for me is a full spectrum if

3114
02:12:01,719 --> 02:12:04,679
I try one thing I get a little bit of

3115
02:12:03,279 --> 02:12:07,198
this I try something else get a little

3116
02:12:04,679 --> 02:12:09,840
bit of this so for over a decade

3117
02:12:07,198 --> 02:12:13,359
personally I've just mix it all together

3118
02:12:09,840 --> 02:12:15,520
into you know um and keep adding to it

3119
02:12:13,359 --> 02:12:18,839
like an everlasting Gobstopper so that

3120
02:12:15,520 --> 02:12:18,840
sounds like full spec

3121
02:12:19,118 --> 02:12:25,519
drums yes yeah but that's works for me

3122
02:12:22,920 --> 02:12:25,520
because I

3123
02:12:26,719 --> 02:12:32,198
have to but you know because some people

3124
02:12:30,279 --> 02:12:34,359
can find a certain flower specifically

3125
02:12:32,198 --> 02:12:36,719
works for them I have because of my Gulf

3126
02:12:34,359 --> 02:12:38,960
War syndrome I have various different

3127
02:12:36,719 --> 02:12:41,559
symptoms from nerve damage to nausea to

3128
02:12:38,960 --> 02:12:44,158
migraines to you know uh different

3129
02:12:41,559 --> 02:12:46,199
situations so each one sort of matters

3130
02:12:44,158 --> 02:12:48,638
so you know combining The Ensemble

3131
02:12:46,198 --> 02:12:50,558
effect of them all allows me to be

3132
02:12:48,639 --> 02:12:52,440
productive and allows me to be a part of

3133
02:12:50,559 --> 02:12:55,520
society

3134
02:12:52,439 --> 02:12:58,319
feel smoke what did you smoke in the 60s

3135
02:12:55,520 --> 02:13:01,520
and the 70s before there were the minor

3136
02:12:58,319 --> 02:13:03,479
canono variety uh I was hanging out in

3137
02:13:01,520 --> 02:13:05,440
my mom's ovaries uh you know we're

3138
02:13:03,479 --> 02:13:09,078
having a great time you know me and the

3139
02:13:05,439 --> 02:13:11,319
other eggs we were all like up no I

3140
02:13:09,078 --> 02:13:13,558
didn't hey Sam you're old it's just for

3141
02:13:11,319 --> 02:13:18,399
me yeah I mean I didn't get turned on

3142
02:13:13,559 --> 02:13:20,000
till I was you know uh yeah 1819 so and

3143
02:13:18,399 --> 02:13:21,839
I didn't really get turned on to real

3144
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:24,599
concentrates until I was was out here in

3145
02:13:21,840 --> 02:13:25,599
California in my early 20s so I mean

3146
02:13:24,599 --> 02:13:27,880
your

3147
02:13:25,599 --> 02:13:30,520
experience you were you were well into

3148
02:13:27,880 --> 02:13:33,118
it way before it's just this is what I

3149
02:13:30,520 --> 02:13:36,000
found over time for me during the access

3150
02:13:33,118 --> 02:13:38,519
because early on in in oaksterdam I was

3151
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:41,078
able to get a lot of quality water hash

3152
02:13:38,520 --> 02:13:43,079
too I had the original machine from

3153
02:13:41,078 --> 02:13:46,759
working at the Galaxy gallery back in

3154
02:13:43,078 --> 02:13:48,960
the uh late 90s so I was making my own

3155
02:13:46,760 --> 02:13:50,679
water hash and people were Contracting

3156
02:13:48,960 --> 02:13:53,480
with me to make their water hash for

3157
02:13:50,679 --> 02:13:56,199
them because they'd never seen a machine

3158
02:13:53,479 --> 02:13:58,359
that could make quality hash like this

3159
02:13:56,198 --> 02:14:02,158
that bubbled I mean that blew our minds

3160
02:13:58,359 --> 02:14:05,238
you know so I just would initially just

3161
02:14:02,158 --> 02:14:07,519
take scrapings off of the coffee filters

3162
02:14:05,238 --> 02:14:09,718
and then mix them together in a coffee

3163
02:14:07,520 --> 02:14:11,320
grinder and that's what started it for

3164
02:14:09,719 --> 02:14:15,000
me and

3165
02:14:11,319 --> 02:14:17,799
so honestly you're way ahead of us by

3166
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:21,279
decades you didn't know what canono you

3167
02:14:17,800 --> 02:14:22,840
were smoking because until when was was

3168
02:14:21,279 --> 02:14:27,359
it uh

3169
02:14:22,840 --> 02:14:30,559
1990 or no wait till 2000 there was not

3170
02:14:27,359 --> 02:14:33,158
analytical labs available in

3171
02:14:30,559 --> 02:14:36,199
California and Sam when do you think the

3172
02:14:33,158 --> 02:14:38,839
first analytic you know analytics really

3173
02:14:36,198 --> 02:14:41,519
were for for cannabinoids you know

3174
02:14:38,840 --> 02:14:43,199
because it you're you're touching on

3175
02:14:41,520 --> 02:14:46,280
this this

3176
02:14:43,198 --> 02:14:49,839
idea people like Dr have been doing this

3177
02:14:46,279 --> 02:14:55,158
for decades and decades we began our

3178
02:14:49,840 --> 02:15:00,119
work in in uh the very early 1990s where

3179
02:14:55,158 --> 02:15:02,960
we got an analytical lab which was uh we

3180
02:15:00,118 --> 02:15:07,399
checked with Dr BR Eisen with the same

3181
02:15:02,960 --> 02:15:10,118
sample to Brian Dr BR Eisen and Dr o and

3182
02:15:07,399 --> 02:15:12,000
our lab and we got identical results and

3183
02:15:10,118 --> 02:15:14,198
we knew we were doing it right and who

3184
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:16,599
was running that lab Sam like was Da was

3185
02:15:14,198 --> 02:15:19,078
Dave Pate the main chemist there correct

3186
02:15:16,599 --> 02:15:21,760
he was the chemist that uh was hired to

3187
02:15:19,078 --> 02:15:23,639
do all this work correct

3188
02:15:21,760 --> 02:15:26,599
so at that time you you guys were really

3189
02:15:23,639 --> 02:15:28,480
kind of for you know the this is really

3190
02:15:26,599 --> 02:15:30,880
great because it's you know the stuff I

3191
02:15:28,479 --> 02:15:33,118
look at every day you know is probably

3192
02:15:30,880 --> 02:15:35,279
on the shoulders of the work that you

3193
02:15:33,118 --> 02:15:37,759
and your team was doing you know in

3194
02:15:35,279 --> 02:15:40,279
terms of the analytics so you know what

3195
02:15:37,760 --> 02:15:42,920
we you know what we're looking at from

3196
02:15:40,279 --> 02:15:45,158
in terms of the micral test is really

3197
02:15:42,920 --> 02:15:46,599
kind of I would still say kind of very

3198
02:15:45,158 --> 02:15:49,479
limiting in terms of what we're able to

3199
02:15:46,599 --> 02:15:52,960
see and test for would you kind of

3200
02:15:49,479 --> 02:15:55,000
agree uh yeah our Focus was not that to

3201
02:15:52,960 --> 02:15:56,599
be honest we were growing organically

3202
02:15:55,000 --> 02:16:01,800
and we didn't worry about it because we

3203
02:15:56,599 --> 02:16:05,400
were not selling it but that said I mean

3204
02:16:01,800 --> 02:16:07,760
uh the truth of it was no nobody had

3205
02:16:05,399 --> 02:16:10,920
minor canbulat nobody knew what they

3206
02:16:07,760 --> 02:16:12,960
were and uh if your variety happened to

3207
02:16:10,920 --> 02:16:16,440
have some in it you didn't know

3208
02:16:12,960 --> 02:16:18,559
it right so yeah that's why right so

3209
02:16:16,439 --> 02:16:20,519
what varieties do you think were what

3210
02:16:18,559 --> 02:16:23,360
regions of the of you know the world in

3211
02:16:20,520 --> 02:16:25,320
terms of of the you know where things

3212
02:16:23,359 --> 02:16:27,279
kind of stem from post ice age do you

3213
02:16:25,319 --> 02:16:29,000
think a lot of these these miners were

3214
02:16:27,279 --> 02:16:30,519
really kind of coming from or were they

3215
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:34,000
really selectively

3216
02:16:30,520 --> 02:16:37,719
bred no they they were all over when the

3217
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:41,079
way we bred High single cannaboid

3218
02:16:37,718 --> 02:16:42,159
varieties of a minor cannaboid was for

3219
02:16:41,079 --> 02:16:45,599
example

3220
02:16:42,159 --> 02:16:48,959
thcv I used California orange because it

3221
02:16:45,599 --> 02:16:51,478
had small amounts in it I used a Thai

3222
02:16:48,959 --> 02:16:53,879
variety that had small amounts I used an

3223
02:16:51,478 --> 02:16:56,478
Afghan variety that had small amounts

3224
02:16:53,879 --> 02:16:59,279
and I used a South African variety that

3225
02:16:56,478 --> 02:17:02,039
had small amounts of thcv and then we

3226
02:16:59,280 --> 02:17:04,679
self those for generations and then

3227
02:17:02,040 --> 02:17:08,439
combined them all at the end and had a

3228
02:17:04,679 --> 02:17:10,638
variety that was well over 10% THC but

3229
02:17:08,439 --> 02:17:15,120
little to no

3230
02:17:10,638 --> 02:17:17,598
THC right wow and we did the same thing

3231
02:17:15,120 --> 02:17:20,280
for all the minor conoids took about

3232
02:17:17,599 --> 02:17:22,239
four or five years for each one of them

3233
02:17:20,280 --> 02:17:24,800
but we were doing a lot of them at the

3234
02:17:22,239 --> 02:17:26,840
same time so you guys went through like

3235
02:17:24,799 --> 02:17:29,318
a whole gener you went through several

3236
02:17:26,840 --> 02:17:31,880
Generations like you went oh we went

3237
02:17:29,318 --> 02:17:37,279
through several Generations absolutely

3238
02:17:31,879 --> 02:17:40,558
correct and everything was was uh uh

3239
02:17:37,280 --> 02:17:42,639
analytically analyzed everything so that

3240
02:17:40,558 --> 02:17:46,079
we were able to use the next

3241
02:17:42,638 --> 02:17:48,839
generation's best of for that targeted

3242
02:17:46,079 --> 02:17:51,439
compound so the were you guys able to to

3243
02:17:48,840 --> 02:17:53,318
Really track what what asset for you

3244
02:17:51,439 --> 02:17:55,040
know what acid forms were really

3245
02:17:53,318 --> 02:17:58,359
happening at what times through the

3246
02:17:55,040 --> 02:18:00,960
process did you guys get that could we

3247
02:17:58,359 --> 02:18:07,200
weren't so interested in that but yes we

3248
02:18:00,959 --> 02:18:08,638
had hlc and we had uh gcfd for the tping

3249
02:18:07,200 --> 02:18:12,280
because I think that the thing I'm

3250
02:18:08,638 --> 02:18:14,478
trying to understand now is is how we

3251
02:18:12,280 --> 02:18:17,719
can track that through certain varieties

3252
02:18:14,478 --> 02:18:20,959
to to feno hunt and you know to to

3253
02:18:17,718 --> 02:18:23,279
maximize the the most out of a you know

3254
02:18:20,959 --> 02:18:26,478
and you said variety to get not only the

3255
02:18:23,280 --> 02:18:26,479
best phenotype but the best

3256
02:18:26,840 --> 02:18:33,799
chemotype well my my suggestion is grow

3257
02:18:30,239 --> 02:18:35,799
them organically in the ground I I used

3258
02:18:33,799 --> 02:18:40,279
a greenhouse but I lived in Holland I

3259
02:18:35,799 --> 02:18:43,679
didn't have a choice so uh and uh they

3260
02:18:40,280 --> 02:18:47,840
will Express the canono turine maximum

3261
02:18:43,679 --> 02:18:51,000
that that variety can do and uh yeah I

3262
02:18:47,840 --> 02:18:53,398
mean it's not hard to grow excellent

3263
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:57,159
weed as long as you don't make stupid

3264
02:18:53,398 --> 02:18:58,599
mistakes but we all do yep well that

3265
02:18:57,159 --> 02:19:01,318
means we shouldn't DeForest then we

3266
02:18:58,599 --> 02:19:03,239
should take all that and do what uh Josh

3267
02:19:01,318 --> 02:19:06,840
was saying right wait wait wait wait

3268
02:19:03,239 --> 02:19:08,119
wait wait grow organically with it Sam I

3269
02:19:06,840 --> 02:19:10,040
thought you were perfect what are you

3270
02:19:08,120 --> 02:19:12,519
talking about he who has patented

3271
02:19:10,040 --> 02:19:16,519
everything I thought you were the

3272
02:19:12,519 --> 02:19:19,920
perfect well I'm So Perfect know I'm not

3273
02:19:16,519 --> 02:19:19,920
quite perfect

3274
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:26,120
well I appreciate the information Sam

3275
02:19:22,638 --> 02:19:28,000
and the knowledge it's uh you know it's

3276
02:19:26,120 --> 02:19:30,800
it's something you know I'm always

3277
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:30,799
trying to pick up

3278
02:19:31,159 --> 02:19:38,558
on uh hey uh Sam when were you first

3279
02:19:34,959 --> 02:19:42,518
that early lab I would say Dr Ole Bren

3280
02:19:38,558 --> 02:19:46,518
Eisen and Dr Mulan Associates uh were

3281
02:19:42,519 --> 02:19:49,318
three of the very very best uh and

3282
02:19:46,519 --> 02:19:51,159
that's who we emulated and we considered

3283
02:19:49,318 --> 02:19:53,719
our uh leaders

3284
02:19:51,159 --> 02:19:57,159
and when we got the same results from

3285
02:19:53,719 --> 02:19:58,920
the same samples uh as they did we knew

3286
02:19:57,159 --> 02:20:01,719
we were doing something

3287
02:19:58,920 --> 02:20:05,040
right when when were you first educated

3288
02:20:01,719 --> 02:20:08,159
on Beaver tpin there uh

3289
02:20:05,040 --> 02:20:10,640
Sam well the first time I went to Canada

3290
02:20:08,159 --> 02:20:10,639
and

3291
02:20:10,959 --> 02:20:15,438
uh I can't help but think Horatio would

3292
02:20:13,639 --> 02:20:18,119
be smiling knowing we're still talking

3293
02:20:15,439 --> 02:20:18,120
about Beaver

3294
02:20:18,639 --> 02:20:23,559
turps what's funny is that they're

3295
02:20:20,799 --> 02:20:27,119
actually used in the food and fragran

3296
02:20:23,559 --> 02:20:30,279
raspberry yeah like raspberry Rasberry

3297
02:20:27,120 --> 02:20:32,640
flavoring vanilla raspberry bunch of

3298
02:20:30,280 --> 02:20:35,439
Beav TPS yep the Beavers sitting there

3299
02:20:32,639 --> 02:20:40,478
in Canada giving us the

3300
02:20:35,439 --> 02:20:43,200
raspberry you know earlier

3301
02:20:40,478 --> 02:20:46,119
about I wanted to go back uh really

3302
02:20:43,200 --> 02:20:49,600
quickly hi everybody sorry hi Kelly I

3303
02:20:46,120 --> 02:20:52,720
had a million going on hi oh my gosh you

3304
02:20:49,600 --> 02:20:55,680
good to see you oh I love all you guys

3305
02:20:52,719 --> 02:20:57,519
so awesome to see you Kelly you're like

3306
02:20:55,680 --> 02:21:00,960
you're like a beacon of

3307
02:20:57,520 --> 02:21:04,359
light I feel the same about you mark a

3308
02:21:00,959 --> 02:21:06,159
you guys um I was just saying you know

3309
02:21:04,359 --> 02:21:08,600
we were talking about the mitigation of

3310
02:21:06,159 --> 02:21:10,760
Ash and a lot of small farmers are

3311
02:21:08,600 --> 02:21:13,159
getting hit and ATN you were just saying

3312
02:21:10,760 --> 02:21:15,159
you know Sun grown it's getting hit

3313
02:21:13,159 --> 02:21:17,840
harder than ever and we really need

3314
02:21:15,159 --> 02:21:20,239
those small farmers to be successful

3315
02:21:17,840 --> 02:21:22,600
it's one of the single most important

3316
02:21:20,239 --> 02:21:25,959
things that we could do on the planet

3317
02:21:22,600 --> 02:21:29,640
Earth is to help small organic farmers

3318
02:21:25,959 --> 02:21:31,559
be successful and one of the ways that I

3319
02:21:29,639 --> 02:21:33,879
just wanted to say to everybody out

3320
02:21:31,559 --> 02:21:36,398
there who's listening who has a small

3321
02:21:33,879 --> 02:21:39,398
farm your success is really important to

3322
02:21:36,398 --> 02:21:42,358
us it's important to many of us and I

3323
02:21:39,398 --> 02:21:45,398
just was thinking you know maybe being

3324
02:21:42,359 --> 02:21:47,600
done earlier try to put something in the

3325
02:21:45,398 --> 02:21:50,680
ground that's going to have all of your

3326
02:21:47,600 --> 02:21:53,280
crops done a good you know a good

3327
02:21:50,680 --> 02:21:55,720
portion of it done early whether that's

3328
02:21:53,280 --> 02:21:59,040
these beautiful Auto flowers that are

3329
02:21:55,719 --> 02:22:01,199
coming on you know some really beautiful

3330
02:21:59,040 --> 02:22:03,720
um tricomes that they're done in early

3331
02:22:01,200 --> 02:22:06,560
August or to do light deps small light

3332
02:22:03,719 --> 02:22:09,039
deps so at least part of your crop is

3333
02:22:06,559 --> 02:22:11,959
going to be finished before the Fire

3334
02:22:09,040 --> 02:22:14,359
season comes on because it's just really

3335
02:22:11,959 --> 02:22:17,799
really important one thing one thing I

3336
02:22:14,359 --> 02:22:21,200
don't like about Auto varieties is you

3337
02:22:17,799 --> 02:22:24,119
can't grab the best clone so easy easy

3338
02:22:21,200 --> 02:22:27,000
and use it for years you got to be

3339
02:22:24,120 --> 02:22:27,000
reading it for

3340
02:22:30,840 --> 02:22:36,600
seeds and can be a pain in the butt so

3341
02:22:34,239 --> 02:22:38,199
uh it it really depends but I just want

3342
02:22:36,600 --> 02:22:40,359
to mention there's a company up there in

3343
02:22:38,200 --> 02:22:44,359
Canada called SRA and they have

3344
02:22:40,359 --> 02:22:48,040
developed a way to keep Mother plants of

3345
02:22:44,359 --> 02:22:51,800
Auto varieties so uh anybody who needs

3346
02:22:48,040 --> 02:22:54,080
their services can check them out

3347
02:22:51,799 --> 02:22:56,679
and also because we've come into the

3348
02:22:54,079 --> 02:22:59,079
legal Market you know keeping clones for

3349
02:22:56,680 --> 02:23:01,920
a lot of sungrown people is not

3350
02:22:59,079 --> 02:23:04,719
important breeding is absolutely

3351
02:23:01,920 --> 02:23:06,799
important having seeds direct sewing

3352
02:23:04,719 --> 02:23:10,039
into the ground you said it earlier Sam

3353
02:23:06,799 --> 02:23:12,079
you know direct sewing deep soil beds or

3354
02:23:10,040 --> 02:23:15,160
how we're going to reach the ultimate

3355
02:23:12,079 --> 02:23:17,478
potential of the plants so we're really

3356
02:23:15,159 --> 02:23:19,039
encouraging these small farmers to have

3357
02:23:17,478 --> 02:23:21,000
their own breeding stock that's

3358
02:23:19,040 --> 02:23:23,680
biologically intelligent

3359
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:26,760
to their soils to their areas to their

3360
02:23:23,680 --> 02:23:28,760
zones and the more that we breed for an

3361
02:23:26,760 --> 02:23:31,359
early finishing we can really beat out

3362
02:23:28,760 --> 02:23:33,760
those fires and these farmers can have

3363
02:23:31,359 --> 02:23:37,399
great success and the Heart Rock lion

3364
02:23:33,760 --> 02:23:39,439
Claw is so dank and filled with flavor

3365
02:23:37,398 --> 02:23:43,879
and buds are

3366
02:23:39,439 --> 02:23:47,279
super uh solid and I mean it's it's he's

3367
02:23:43,879 --> 02:23:51,278
doing I mean in Daniel's case at Heart

3368
02:23:47,279 --> 02:23:53,399
Rock I mean he I think he did 140

3369
02:23:51,279 --> 02:23:58,600
crosses this year and he's planning on

3370
02:23:53,398 --> 02:24:02,039
doing 300 crosses next year so and for

3371
02:23:58,600 --> 02:24:05,159
good breathing power to the

3372
02:24:02,040 --> 02:24:09,319
SE and for good breathing you really do

3373
02:24:05,159 --> 02:24:10,959
need yeah and and also clones if they're

3374
02:24:09,318 --> 02:24:12,959
part of the breeding

3375
02:24:10,959 --> 02:24:15,679
program oh I mean there's a reason to

3376
02:24:12,959 --> 02:24:19,639
keep clones there is but I I don't know

3377
02:24:15,680 --> 02:24:22,800
if you have to in the case of like you

3378
02:24:19,639 --> 02:24:24,559
know Auto flowers I you know but I'm

3379
02:24:22,799 --> 02:24:26,759
there's a there's an intention to

3380
02:24:24,559 --> 02:24:29,840
everything so if your intention is to to

3381
02:24:26,760 --> 02:24:31,920
do some certain thing with a clone and

3382
02:24:29,840 --> 02:24:33,279
you know well I don't know you know I

3383
02:24:31,920 --> 02:24:35,040
think that we could really have that

3384
02:24:33,279 --> 02:24:37,840
discussion I think that that's a really

3385
02:24:35,040 --> 02:24:40,640
interesting topic Sam because when you

3386
02:24:37,840 --> 02:24:42,920
take clones you're really starting to

3387
02:24:40,639 --> 02:24:44,920
mitigate the immune response of that

3388
02:24:42,920 --> 02:24:47,920
plant then you have to take that plant

3389
02:24:44,920 --> 02:24:50,478
inside you may have to put it into a pot

3390
02:24:47,920 --> 02:24:53,600
it's no longer in a microbial rich

3391
02:24:50,478 --> 02:24:57,079
environment it's no longer in the

3392
02:24:53,600 --> 02:24:59,439
sunshine can't have round and I think

3393
02:24:57,079 --> 02:25:01,680
for small farmers I think that it's

3394
02:24:59,439 --> 02:25:04,760
really great for them to continually

3395
02:25:01,680 --> 02:25:07,079
choose their varietals by using

3396
02:25:04,760 --> 02:25:09,520
chemotypes a lot of these Farmers now

3397
02:25:07,079 --> 02:25:13,760
have field tests that they're able to

3398
02:25:09,520 --> 02:25:17,359
look at their chemotypes out in the

3399
02:25:13,760 --> 02:25:19,359
field and they're really able to track

3400
02:25:17,359 --> 02:25:21,840
what it is that they're looking for and

3401
02:25:19,359 --> 02:25:24,359
they're able to do it intelligent it's

3402
02:25:21,840 --> 02:25:29,439
it's just an interesting if we're going

3403
02:25:24,359 --> 02:25:34,079
to be just small farmers

3404
02:25:29,439 --> 02:25:35,720
and not just talking about science and

3405
02:25:34,079 --> 02:25:38,439
we're not just looking at it in a

3406
02:25:35,719 --> 02:25:40,920
scientific way but we're get out a good

3407
02:25:38,439 --> 02:25:43,639
triome Rich crop that can be used out on

3408
02:25:40,920 --> 02:25:46,398
the market breeding seeds is a wonderful

3409
02:25:43,639 --> 02:25:48,439
um opportunity for them so I just wanted

3410
02:25:46,398 --> 02:25:51,278
to bring up the other side of that um

3411
02:25:48,439 --> 02:25:54,880
you know and not taking clones okay but

3412
02:25:51,279 --> 02:25:59,159
I I for example I maintain my mother's

3413
02:25:54,879 --> 02:25:59,159
in the ground 15 feet

3414
02:25:59,359 --> 02:26:05,279
tall wow I wish I could do that Sam I

3415
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:07,359
mean I I have I we have some big mothers

3416
02:26:05,279 --> 02:26:10,239
we got a whole room of them but even

3417
02:26:07,359 --> 02:26:12,279
even at a at a facility that's that's a

3418
02:26:10,239 --> 02:26:14,920
big M we we change our mothers out more

3419
02:26:12,279 --> 02:26:18,479
often than that um to try to keep them

3420
02:26:14,920 --> 02:26:22,960
more vigorous and try to keep the you

3421
02:26:18,478 --> 02:26:25,959
know as much uh Vigor and and as least

3422
02:26:22,959 --> 02:26:27,159
pathogen you know filled as as we can

3423
02:26:25,959 --> 02:26:30,719
you know because there's a lot of things

3424
02:26:27,159 --> 02:26:33,600
that go along Pest and pathogen problems

3425
02:26:30,719 --> 02:26:39,519
because I use so many bio controls as

3426
02:26:33,600 --> 02:26:44,800
preventatives to be honest yeah mother

3427
02:26:39,520 --> 02:26:46,720
lovers Hey so uh so Sam do you I mean I

3428
02:26:44,799 --> 02:26:49,159
Kelly I think you know the it's an

3429
02:26:46,719 --> 02:26:51,679
interesting topic because um I think

3430
02:26:49,159 --> 02:26:53,840
about a lot of these things and you know

3431
02:26:51,680 --> 02:26:55,680
there's when you're talking about saving

3432
02:26:53,840 --> 02:26:57,799
seed and saving varieties Sam wouldn't

3433
02:26:55,680 --> 02:27:01,960
you agree it's good to save save the

3434
02:26:57,799 --> 02:27:04,119
seeds and save you know save those those

3435
02:27:01,959 --> 02:27:06,599
potential uh new phenotypes and

3436
02:27:04,120 --> 02:27:09,880
chemotypes that you could get from you

3437
02:27:06,600 --> 02:27:11,520
know starting Offspring from bringing

3438
02:27:09,879 --> 02:27:13,759
things together that you know you you

3439
02:27:11,520 --> 02:27:17,560
may have hand selected even though it

3440
02:27:13,760 --> 02:27:20,520
might not be 2,000 or 5,000 of each to

3441
02:27:17,559 --> 02:27:23,600
to keep the gene pole as we say um I

3442
02:27:20,520 --> 02:27:26,960
think it's a good thing um I I think I

3443
02:27:23,600 --> 02:27:32,120
I've kept clones for 22 years 24 years

3444
02:27:26,959 --> 02:27:34,398
actually um but I also still without a

3445
02:27:32,120 --> 02:27:36,600
problem right so but I've also started

3446
02:27:34,398 --> 02:27:38,239
new seeds and I also recognize the value

3447
02:27:36,600 --> 02:27:41,079
especially now when I'm now that I'm

3448
02:27:38,239 --> 02:27:42,920
growing at scale for commercial reasons

3449
02:27:41,079 --> 02:27:45,120
we're starting like all types of

3450
02:27:42,920 --> 02:27:47,680
different varieties and I'm seeing some

3451
02:27:45,120 --> 02:27:49,520
really interesting things that I would

3452
02:27:47,680 --> 02:27:52,279
have never thought as a younger self to

3453
02:27:49,520 --> 02:27:54,040
even you know to even try or attempt to

3454
02:27:52,279 --> 02:27:57,200
do because I just have these clones that

3455
02:27:54,040 --> 02:28:01,399
I just know so well to be honest I think

3456
02:27:57,200 --> 02:28:03,960
the closest uh agricultural crop

3457
02:28:01,398 --> 02:28:05,879
similarity wise is

3458
02:28:03,959 --> 02:28:09,119
strawberries when you want a new

3459
02:28:05,879 --> 02:28:12,759
strawberry variety you you cross a bunch

3460
02:28:09,120 --> 02:28:14,920
of different varieties that H wild or

3461
02:28:12,760 --> 02:28:19,719
whatever that have the traits you're

3462
02:28:14,920 --> 02:28:23,279
after then they grow out 20,000 seeds

3463
02:28:19,719 --> 02:28:25,879
and they select the 10 or 20 that are

3464
02:28:23,279 --> 02:28:29,880
the most favorable and then they

3465
02:28:25,879 --> 02:28:33,920
reproduce Runners from those mother

3466
02:28:29,879 --> 02:28:37,719
clones and uh they eventually have

3467
02:28:33,920 --> 02:28:39,600
millions of Runners to use as a

3468
02:28:37,719 --> 02:28:43,119
production crop and that's the way

3469
02:28:39,600 --> 02:28:44,920
canvas is sure and I I think to Kelly's

3470
02:28:43,120 --> 02:28:46,760
point I think that's you know I think

3471
02:28:44,920 --> 02:28:48,520
it's a good thing to I don't know

3472
02:28:46,760 --> 02:28:52,000
personally I think it's a good thing to

3473
02:28:48,520 --> 02:28:53,720
be exploring and uh understanding you

3474
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:55,680
know what different varieties could do

3475
02:28:53,719 --> 02:28:57,760
do together because you know it's

3476
02:28:55,680 --> 02:29:00,680
expansive in terms of the creative

3477
02:28:57,760 --> 02:29:02,760
aspect it's Natural Evolution I mean you

3478
02:29:00,680 --> 02:29:05,200
you know without that the you know the

3479
02:29:02,760 --> 02:29:07,559
Clone never changes so obviously you're

3480
02:29:05,200 --> 02:29:09,680
going to be doing seed breeding you know

3481
02:29:07,559 --> 02:29:11,680
but it's fun to keep like a sour diesel

3482
02:29:09,680 --> 02:29:14,159
forever for example you know what I mean

3483
02:29:11,680 --> 02:29:15,520
like who doesn't want to who doesn't

3484
02:29:14,159 --> 02:29:18,039
want to grow a whole entire Greenhouse

3485
02:29:15,520 --> 02:29:19,840
of Sour Diesel like come on right and

3486
02:29:18,040 --> 02:29:21,800
and the recessive traits always come up

3487
02:29:19,840 --> 02:29:24,279
when breed with it so it's really

3488
02:29:21,799 --> 02:29:25,840
difficult to recreate um and that's the

3489
02:29:24,279 --> 02:29:28,279
other thing for me that I'm interested

3490
02:29:25,840 --> 02:29:30,159
in is trying to work with the dominant

3491
02:29:28,279 --> 02:29:33,000
traits that on some of these really

3492
02:29:30,159 --> 02:29:36,079
Elite things that I have and you know

3493
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:38,359
it's it's fun to to try to see what

3494
02:29:36,079 --> 02:29:41,039
other Offspring can you know can kind of

3495
02:29:38,359 --> 02:29:43,720
do I think uh Marcus and I were were

3496
02:29:41,040 --> 02:29:45,640
talking to a friend uh to a friend of

3497
02:29:43,719 --> 02:29:47,159
his the other day he was or a little

3498
02:29:45,639 --> 02:29:48,799
while ago on a on a chat and he was

3499
02:29:47,159 --> 02:29:51,879
talking about using the sky jarro from

3500
02:29:48,799 --> 02:29:54,199
meene to to breed with his other crop

3501
02:29:51,879 --> 02:29:55,839
because it was so non-invasive so it

3502
02:29:54,200 --> 02:29:58,279
really brought the dominant traits out

3503
02:29:55,840 --> 02:30:02,040
in the in the the parent stock that he

3504
02:29:58,279 --> 02:30:04,439
was using so that you know it's I think

3505
02:30:02,040 --> 02:30:06,640
there's a lot of value to

3506
02:30:04,439 --> 02:30:09,600
that it is

3507
02:30:06,639 --> 02:30:11,879
true

3508
02:30:09,600 --> 02:30:16,318
Sor I keep

3509
02:30:11,879 --> 02:30:19,478
clones for for breeding and pro

3510
02:30:16,318 --> 02:30:23,559
production but I every year grow the

3511
02:30:19,478 --> 02:30:26,559
majority of the plants from seed because

3512
02:30:23,559 --> 02:30:28,959
that's where the new exciting [ __ ] is

3513
02:30:26,559 --> 02:30:31,478
yeah yeah and you know it's a lot like

3514
02:30:28,959 --> 02:30:33,239
an apple tree you can you can have this

3515
02:30:31,478 --> 02:30:37,039
beautiful gorgeous apple tree and it's

3516
02:30:33,239 --> 02:30:38,680
the best apples ever and you can seeds

3517
02:30:37,040 --> 02:30:40,840
off of that apple tree and you're never

3518
02:30:38,680 --> 02:30:44,079
going to be able to recreate that same

3519
02:30:40,840 --> 02:30:45,880
apple tree so when you do you know bre

3520
02:30:44,079 --> 02:30:48,398
with that clone or whatever it's never

3521
02:30:45,879 --> 02:30:51,959
going to be the same so there is

3522
02:30:48,398 --> 02:30:54,519
some beauty in the sour diesel being

3523
02:30:51,959 --> 02:30:56,679
held forever or that Jack hair that you

3524
02:30:54,520 --> 02:31:00,560
know is in Eugene I'm so stoked that

3525
02:30:56,680 --> 02:31:03,760
people are holding on to that with app

3526
02:31:00,559 --> 02:31:07,278
the Cavendish banana they gra them they

3527
02:31:03,760 --> 02:31:10,960
gra them because you can gra a mother

3528
02:31:07,279 --> 02:31:15,319
onto one billion different graphs and

3529
02:31:10,959 --> 02:31:18,000
you get a branch of that unique Apple so

3530
02:31:15,318 --> 02:31:21,359
there's easy ways to maintain apples

3531
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:23,760
forever resin Ranch resin Ranch what's

3532
02:31:21,359 --> 02:31:26,479
up in the house

3533
02:31:23,760 --> 02:31:28,478
there just stopping by and Alice was

3534
02:31:26,478 --> 02:31:30,920
like hey you want to say

3535
02:31:28,478 --> 02:31:33,760

doing good man how are you doing I like

3537
02:31:33,760 --> 02:31:39,398
the shirt we're uh we're

3538
02:31:36,680 --> 02:31:41,479
surviving are you yeah we're getting

3539
02:31:39,398 --> 02:31:43,559
getting pretty impacted by the fires

3540
02:31:41,478 --> 02:31:47,639
we've been by the August the August

3541
02:31:43,559 --> 02:31:50,799
complex fire in your area fire is uh

3542
02:31:47,639 --> 02:31:52,599
been smoking out the farm yeah uh down

3543
02:31:50,799 --> 02:31:54,719
here in Sebastapol we've pretty much

3544
02:31:52,600 --> 02:31:58,318
been flanked by fires all

3545
02:31:54,719 --> 02:31:59,719
summer so it's been totally I feel like

3546
02:31:58,318 --> 02:32:02,439
it's starting to take a toll on my

3547
02:31:59,719 --> 02:32:04,358
health at this point yeah you know I

3548
02:32:02,439 --> 02:32:06,479
wanted to come on and that's what I

3549
02:32:04,359 --> 02:32:08,559
wanted to talk about today you know

3550
02:32:06,478 --> 02:32:11,639
really quickly I didn't know if this was

3551
02:32:08,559 --> 02:32:14,719
uh the right time to do that but just

3552
02:32:11,639 --> 02:32:19,439
about you know how we can you know

3553
02:32:14,719 --> 02:32:21,199
mitigate some of the toxic intake of the

3554
02:32:19,439 --> 02:32:23,479
smoke in the ash you know we've been

3555
02:32:21,200 --> 02:32:25,760
really focused on our plants because our

3556
02:32:23,478 --> 02:32:28,760
plants is our income our plants is our

3557
02:32:25,760 --> 02:32:28,760
future

3558
02:32:28,840 --> 02:32:34,040
but our health and well-being is also

3559
02:32:31,520 --> 02:32:35,760
our future and how we're gonna you know

3560
02:32:34,040 --> 02:32:37,319
make our next decisions and how we're

3561
02:32:35,760 --> 02:32:39,398
going to move forward we really need to

3562
02:32:37,318 --> 02:32:41,000
be healthy and I just wanted to talk

3563
02:32:39,398 --> 02:32:43,478
about a few things that people could be

3564
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:45,239
allying with down there so you know

3565
02:32:43,478 --> 02:32:48,039
let's let's talk about that is this a

3566
02:32:45,239 --> 02:32:51,199
good time are we like cool come on in I

3567
02:32:48,040 --> 02:32:52,880
got nothing going on and cool

3568
02:32:51,200 --> 02:32:54,640
I just wanted if you wanted to come in

3569
02:32:52,879 --> 02:32:56,639
and talk about some updates that were

3570
02:32:54,639 --> 02:33:01,119
really important that people need to

3571
02:32:56,639 --> 02:33:03,519
know in the region and area first or uh

3572
02:33:01,120 --> 02:33:05,880
updates it's kind of hard to stay up

3573
02:33:03,520 --> 02:33:09,000
with I I just tell anybody get on the

3574
02:33:05,879 --> 02:33:11,478
calire website because it's I mean it's

3575
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:14,639
changing some days it changes

3576
02:33:11,478 --> 02:33:17,599
hourly uh the August complex fire is

3577
02:33:14,639 --> 02:33:20,159
definitely taking a major toll on the

3578
02:33:17,600 --> 02:33:23,520
Cannabis industry in Humble trend this

3579
02:33:20,159 --> 02:33:26,439
year I think more than any previous

3580
02:33:23,520 --> 02:33:28,840
year uh definitely more Farms actually

3581
02:33:26,439 --> 02:33:29,960
burning than just being impacted by Ash

3582
02:33:28,840 --> 02:33:33,200
and

3583
02:33:29,959 --> 02:33:35,398
smoke uh I don't want to get into the

3584
02:33:33,200 --> 02:33:37,880
stories I'm hearing about how calir is

3585
02:33:35,398 --> 02:33:40,920
treating the situation up there on some

3586
02:33:37,879 --> 02:33:43,199
properties uh it's just messed up that's

3587
02:33:40,920 --> 02:33:46,120
all there is to it and we I

3588
02:33:43,200 --> 02:33:47,640
think it's pretty eye openening most the

3589
02:33:46,120 --> 02:33:50,439
people in the room I think would agree

3590
02:33:47,639 --> 02:33:52,879
with me that as human beings we need to

3591
02:33:50,439 --> 02:33:56,239
open our eyes up to what's going on and

3592
02:33:52,879 --> 02:33:58,398
make some serious changes because and be

3593
02:33:56,239 --> 02:34:00,879
aware human beings we can't we can't

3594
02:33:58,398 --> 02:34:02,119
live like this you know that's kind of

3595
02:34:00,879 --> 02:34:05,318
the thing I was thinking about the other

3596
02:34:02,120 --> 02:34:07,160
day I remember a Discovery Channel show

3597
02:34:05,318 --> 02:34:09,879
on the end of the world and them talking

3598
02:34:07,159 --> 02:34:12,398
about climate change and massive fires

3599
02:34:09,879 --> 02:34:14,959
in the west that would burn uncontrolled

3600
02:34:12,398 --> 02:34:16,398
and air quality and I remember thinking

3601
02:34:14,959 --> 02:34:17,839
oh man that sounds horrible but that

3602
02:34:16,398 --> 02:34:20,358
probably won't happen in my lifetime and

3603
02:34:17,840 --> 02:34:21,760
here we are living it so so like the

3604
02:34:20,359 --> 02:34:24,200
last two weeks pretty much have had a

3605
02:34:21,760 --> 02:34:25,559
low grade headache the whole time really

3606
02:34:24,200 --> 02:34:27,920
low on

3607
02:34:25,559 --> 02:34:29,680
energy uh and when we looked into that

3608
02:34:27,920 --> 02:34:32,840
they they call it a carbon headache

3609
02:34:29,680 --> 02:34:34,239
apparently from inhaling so much smoke

3610
02:34:32,840 --> 02:34:36,760
and like you said yeah we all worry

3611
02:34:34,239 --> 02:34:39,439
about our plants because it's our income

3612
02:34:36,760 --> 02:34:41,800
and I definitely have put myself in some

3613
02:34:39,439 --> 02:34:45,398
situations this year that probably yeah

3614
02:34:41,799 --> 02:34:50,079
does put my health on the line in order

3615
02:34:45,398 --> 02:34:51,920
to salvage the Cannabis which

3616
02:34:50,079 --> 02:34:53,279
I'm not sure how I feel about that

3617
02:34:51,920 --> 02:34:56,439
personally at this

3618
02:34:53,279 --> 02:34:58,600
point which is you know we always you

3619
02:34:56,439 --> 02:35:02,398
know we we hold this plant so high and

3620
02:34:58,600 --> 02:35:04,920
we do so much for it but and when it's

3621
02:35:02,398 --> 02:35:08,239
your income it is hard to make that call

3622
02:35:04,920 --> 02:35:10,600
that I need to walk away like it's not

3623
02:35:08,239 --> 02:35:12,760
easy and you were faced with that this

3624
02:35:10,600 --> 02:35:15,359
year yeah yeah I mean we've been faced

3625
02:35:12,760 --> 02:35:17,960
with it more than once yeah and then I

3626
02:35:15,359 --> 02:35:21,239
have uh you know a farm I consult on

3627
02:35:17,959 --> 02:35:24,159
that is up on spyrock which which is now

3628
02:35:21,239 --> 02:35:26,520
starting to be evacuated really been an

3629
02:35:24,159 --> 02:35:29,359
evacuation warning for a while I don't

3630
02:35:26,520 --> 02:35:30,880
think spyrock it's gonna actually get to

3631
02:35:29,359 --> 02:35:33,720
that point

3632
02:35:30,879 --> 02:35:35,199
but we've said that a few times and it's

3633
02:35:33,719 --> 02:35:38,039
crossed the eel they didn't think that

3634
02:35:35,200 --> 02:35:42,560
was going to happen you know

3635
02:35:38,040 --> 02:35:44,240
so fingers crossed Spyro yeah well that

3636
02:35:42,559 --> 02:35:47,199
that that carbon headache that you're

3637
02:35:44,239 --> 02:35:49,199
feeling is just massive inhalation of

3638
02:35:47,200 --> 02:35:51,040
smoke and what happens is there's a

3639
02:35:49,200 --> 02:35:54,479
restriction of the capillaries in the

3640
02:35:51,040 --> 02:35:57,120
body because the body starts to react to

3641
02:35:54,478 --> 02:36:00,599
such a massive change in the environment

3642
02:35:57,120 --> 02:36:04,560
we are so much a part of our environment

3643
02:36:00,600 --> 02:36:07,120
like the Earth resonates at like a 7.82

3644
02:36:04,559 --> 02:36:08,318
or something like that don't quote me on

3645
02:36:07,120 --> 02:36:11,120
the same numbers but you know that

3646
02:36:08,318 --> 02:36:14,760
humans resonance and our bodies resonate

3647
02:36:11,120 --> 02:36:16,560
on the same exact you know uh frequency

3648
02:36:14,760 --> 02:36:18,880
so when there's like a whole lot of

3649
02:36:16,559 --> 02:36:20,760
smoke and fire in the air not only is

3650
02:36:18,879 --> 02:36:23,039
there a whole lot of smoke and fire in

3651
02:36:20,760 --> 02:36:25,719
the air but the actual

3652
02:36:23,040 --> 02:36:27,560
Resonance of the vibration of the area

3653
02:36:25,719 --> 02:36:29,840
and the zone that you're in actually

3654
02:36:27,559 --> 02:36:33,079
changes so it's incredibly detrimental

3655
02:36:29,840 --> 02:36:34,840
to us on lots of different levels so not

3656
02:36:33,079 --> 02:36:37,039
only are we getting smoke inhalation but

3657
02:36:34,840 --> 02:36:39,318
the resonance is changing and we need to

3658
02:36:37,040 --> 02:36:40,800
be dealing with mental health issues you

3659
02:36:39,318 --> 02:36:44,039
know a lot of people are like whoa

3660
02:36:40,799 --> 02:36:46,438
another day of smoke not only is it that

3661
02:36:44,040 --> 02:36:48,399
we're yeah in covid and that people are

3662
02:36:46,439 --> 02:36:50,318
having restrictions all over the place

3663
02:36:48,398 --> 02:36:53,199
but we're dealing with the lack of

3664
02:36:50,318 --> 02:36:56,478
sunshine uh you know Ash and smoke and

3665
02:36:53,200 --> 02:36:58,640
also the resonance changing so in order

3666
02:36:56,478 --> 02:37:02,000
to take care of your internal health you

3667
02:36:58,639 --> 02:37:04,799
know allying with oser right now oser

3668
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:07,920
root is so so important you can get it

3669
02:37:04,799 --> 02:37:09,239
in tincture you can get it in um any and

3670
02:37:07,920 --> 02:37:11,398
and it's found in the hills of

3671
02:37:09,239 --> 02:37:16,318
California some people call it bear

3672
02:37:11,398 --> 02:37:18,599
grass you can and and go oh yeah OSHA

3673
02:37:16,318 --> 02:37:21,680
and that's something that we can really

3674
02:37:18,600 --> 02:37:23,680
find in a lot of zones and regions um

3675
02:37:21,680 --> 02:37:26,680
also any kind of immune

3676
02:37:23,680 --> 02:37:28,600
stimulants uh eonia right now is being

3677
02:37:26,680 --> 02:37:31,680
dug

3678
02:37:28,600 --> 02:37:33,120
up I can't say you know more than ever

3679
02:37:31,680 --> 02:37:35,600
this is a time to really look at our

3680
02:37:33,120 --> 02:37:37,200
Farms look at our little Gardens and

3681
02:37:35,600 --> 02:37:39,040
what haven't we planted do we have

3682
02:37:37,200 --> 02:37:41,600
burdock root really good for cleaning

3683
02:37:39,040 --> 02:37:43,840
the blood right now uh also activated

3684
02:37:41,600 --> 02:37:45,359
charcoal taking a lot of activated

3685
02:37:43,840 --> 02:37:48,120
charcoal because when you're breathing

3686
02:37:45,359 --> 02:37:50,318
in these toxins you know it's actually

3687
02:37:48,120 --> 02:37:52,439
being lodged into different areas of

3688
02:37:50,318 --> 02:37:55,039
your body and activated charcoal can

3689
02:37:52,439 --> 02:37:57,639
help wash it out and I guess and

3690
02:37:55,040 --> 02:38:01,040
bentonite clay is another one zealite

3691
02:37:57,639 --> 02:38:04,959
clay even more activated more charged

3692
02:38:01,040 --> 02:38:06,120
easy to find um and also you know your

3693
02:38:04,959 --> 02:38:08,519
indigenous

3694
02:38:06,120 --> 02:38:09,680
microorganisms however you all are you

3695
02:38:08,520 --> 02:38:12,399
you know making indigenous

3696
02:38:09,680 --> 02:38:13,720
microorganisms for your plants make sure

3697
02:38:12,398 --> 02:38:16,199
that you're drinking a little bit of

3698
02:38:13,719 --> 02:38:18,959
your em a little bit of your lactic acid

3699
02:38:16,200 --> 02:38:21,640
bacteria culture your sourkraut water

3700
02:38:18,959 --> 02:38:23,719
your k Chi all of those things that are

3701
02:38:21,639 --> 02:38:26,199
going to boost our microbiome is

3702
02:38:23,719 --> 02:38:29,119
incredibly important right now and what

3703
02:38:26,200 --> 02:38:33,000
I wanted to say last is the most

3704
02:38:29,120 --> 02:38:36,079
important is water we have to be

3705
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:38,639
drinking water you have to be drinking

3706
02:38:36,079 --> 02:38:40,959
more water than you even think that your

3707
02:38:38,639 --> 02:38:44,639
body can be handling right now even when

3708
02:38:40,959 --> 02:38:46,879
your belly is full of water you have to

3709
02:38:44,639 --> 02:38:49,599
be drinking more water because just like

3710
02:38:46,879 --> 02:38:52,079
the plants and in the air all of that

3711
02:38:49,600 --> 02:38:54,520
Ash is taking all of those humidity

3712
02:38:52,079 --> 02:38:57,639
particles out of the air and it's

3713
02:38:54,520 --> 02:38:59,640
causing an incredible dehydration in the

3714
02:38:57,639 --> 02:39:02,879
air and in our body and when we have

3715
02:38:59,639 --> 02:39:04,639
dehydration all that does is exacerbate

3716
02:39:02,879 --> 02:39:08,358
all of the other maladies that we might

3717
02:39:04,639 --> 02:39:10,920
be holding on to which is absolutely the

3718
02:39:08,359 --> 02:39:12,960
same as our mental health so if we're

3719
02:39:10,920 --> 02:39:15,239
already on the edge of not feeling so

3720
02:39:12,959 --> 02:39:17,519
well we get dehydrated it's over it's

3721
02:39:15,239 --> 02:39:20,478
done we're we're in a hole of of

3722
02:39:17,520 --> 02:39:23,359
depression or not feeling well Al so

3723
02:39:20,478 --> 02:39:25,519
really important drinking water and and

3724
02:39:23,359 --> 02:39:27,600
and opening up our hearts right now to

3725
02:39:25,520 --> 02:39:29,640
compassion for those people that are

3726
02:39:27,600 --> 02:39:33,120
really needing help I think as human

3727
02:39:29,639 --> 02:39:35,439
beings we are here on this planet to be

3728
02:39:33,120 --> 02:39:37,359
a collective Consciousness and now more

3729
02:39:35,439 --> 02:39:40,000
than ever we need to recognize that a

3730
02:39:37,359 --> 02:39:42,800
part of our planet is really is really

3731
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:44,398
hurting right now so whenever we can

3732
02:39:42,799 --> 02:39:47,119
those people who aren't on the west

3733
02:39:44,398 --> 02:39:48,799
coast send Good Vibes to the West Coast

3734
02:39:47,120 --> 02:39:50,920
send Good Vibes to our brothers and

3735
02:39:48,799 --> 02:39:54,079
sisters are out there it's meaningful

3736
02:39:50,920 --> 02:39:55,159
prayer matters you know so people on the

3737
02:39:54,079 --> 02:39:57,959
west coast feel like they're getting

3738
02:39:55,159 --> 02:40:00,680
burned out right now I mean you know I I

3739
02:39:57,959 --> 02:40:03,919
think you may be talking about that Todd

3740
02:40:00,680 --> 02:40:07,239
whatnot I mean it's uh that's kind of

3741
02:40:03,920 --> 02:40:10,159
the other thing is this the stress level

3742
02:40:07,239 --> 02:40:12,398
that I know I'm operating at and I can

3743
02:40:10,159 --> 02:40:15,039
imagine that everybody else in my

3744
02:40:12,398 --> 02:40:17,799
position is operating at this year on

3745
02:40:15,040 --> 02:40:20,640
top of it just being 2020 and all the

3746
02:40:17,799 --> 02:40:22,519
other crap going on is it's pretty

3747
02:40:20,639 --> 02:40:24,559
insane that I've actually gotten

3748
02:40:22,520 --> 02:40:27,279
comfortable operating at this stress

3749
02:40:24,559 --> 02:40:30,398
level it kind of scares me and yeah it's

3750
02:40:27,279 --> 02:40:33,239
just this year more than others has me

3751
02:40:30,398 --> 02:40:34,599
rethinking things like when I first

3752
02:40:33,239 --> 02:40:36,920
hopped in Alice said you guys were

3753
02:40:34,600 --> 02:40:40,040
talking about you know starting earlier

3754
02:40:36,920 --> 02:40:42,520
different time all that stuff I was just

3755
02:40:40,040 --> 02:40:44,960
talking about that the other week that

3756
02:40:42,520 --> 02:40:47,000
yeah totally has me rethinking how I

3757
02:40:44,959 --> 02:40:49,559
want to run the

3758
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:50,959
gardens and do that you know I don't I

3759
02:40:49,559 --> 02:40:54,079
don't think I'm GNA even attempt a

3760
02:40:50,959 --> 02:40:56,719
second depth next year yeah diversify

3761
02:40:54,079 --> 02:40:58,680
and really make use your product go

3762
02:40:56,719 --> 02:41:02,159
ahead hard for me to pull off a second

3763
02:40:58,680 --> 02:41:04,479
depth in my spot just as it is and then

3764
02:41:02,159 --> 02:41:06,279
stuff like you know we flipped the Hoops

3765
02:41:04,478 --> 02:41:08,840
the fire happened the next day we didn't

3766
02:41:06,279 --> 02:41:11,279
see the Sun for three weeks my plants

3767
02:41:08,840 --> 02:41:13,639
went through the roof you know node

3768
02:41:11,279 --> 02:41:16,279
spacing is like a

3769
02:41:13,639 --> 02:41:18,039
foot it's you know it's it's and the

3770
02:41:16,279 --> 02:41:20,200
full terms do all right because they got

3771
02:41:18,040 --> 02:41:22,319
to set up earlier in the before Fire

3772
02:41:20,200 --> 02:41:24,720
season they seem to handle it a lot

3773
02:41:22,318 --> 02:41:26,559
better they they don't seem to get smoke

3774
02:41:24,719 --> 02:41:30,239
damage as easy because they've already

3775
02:41:26,559 --> 02:41:32,920
kind of Co it up yeah know back to more

3776
02:41:30,239 --> 02:41:35,279
full terms more seed starts less

3777
02:41:32,920 --> 02:41:37,760
STS yeah and here we are you know we're

3778
02:41:35,279 --> 02:41:40,760
allying with a plant that's an adaptogen

3779
02:41:37,760 --> 02:41:42,279
and we uh you know as cannabis Farmers a

3780
02:41:40,760 --> 02:41:45,079
lot of us who have been in this for a

3781
02:41:42,279 --> 02:41:48,279
long time have been really adaptogenic

3782
02:41:45,079 --> 02:41:50,079
to laws to regulations to still trying

3783
02:41:48,279 --> 02:41:52,560
to get our crop out so I really

3784
02:41:50,079 --> 02:41:55,520
encourage us as a community even though

3785
02:41:52,559 --> 02:41:58,079
we're feeling really beaten down we are

3786
02:41:55,520 --> 02:42:00,079
resilient we're an incredibly resilient

3787
02:41:58,079 --> 02:42:02,120
group of people I've never met a more

3788
02:42:00,079 --> 02:42:04,879
resilient group of people all over the

3789
02:42:02,120 --> 02:42:07,800
world so let's take that resilience and

3790
02:42:04,879 --> 02:42:10,159
become adaptogens and switch up what we

3791
02:42:07,799 --> 02:42:12,840
need to so we can still get out the good

3792
02:42:10,159 --> 02:42:15,799
medicine and if we need to just have one

3793
02:42:12,840 --> 02:42:18,680
depth that's even bigger that's earlier

3794
02:42:15,799 --> 02:42:21,679
or you know even longer varietal that go

3795
02:42:18,680 --> 02:42:23,359
even way further you know let's also

3796
02:42:21,680 --> 02:42:25,760
talk about that we've been talking about

3797
02:42:23,359 --> 02:42:29,279
finishing earlier but what about those

3798
02:42:25,760 --> 02:42:32,079
you know really long flowering

3799
02:42:29,279 --> 02:42:33,880
SAS you know thin Leaf varietals that go

3800
02:42:32,079 --> 02:42:35,520
and go and go that aren't really done

3801
02:42:33,879 --> 02:42:37,719
until the beginning of December a lot of

3802
02:42:35,520 --> 02:42:39,880
people in California can be doing you

3803
02:42:37,719 --> 02:42:41,879
know those varietals well you know

3804
02:42:39,879 --> 02:42:43,959
they're well out of uh you know the Fire

3805
02:42:41,879 --> 02:42:45,759
season one other thing I wanted to say

3806
02:42:43,959 --> 02:42:48,199
is that as well as the Cannabis is an

3807
02:42:45,760 --> 02:42:49,680
adaptogen the other thing to Ally with

3808
02:42:48,200 --> 02:42:52,560
is our medicinal mus

3809
02:42:49,680 --> 02:42:55,600
mushrooms are really important a lot of

3810
02:42:52,559 --> 02:42:57,879
people are doing micro sweet medicinal

3811
02:42:55,600 --> 02:43:01,840
mushrooms so incredibly important right

3812
02:42:57,879 --> 02:43:04,278
now um and also so many people are doing

3813
02:43:01,840 --> 02:43:08,520
uh cubensis and and really doing a lot

3814
02:43:04,279 --> 02:43:10,760
of micro dosing Ann Arbor Michigan woo

3815
02:43:08,520 --> 02:43:13,880
just legalized or just decriminalized

3816
02:43:10,760 --> 02:43:17,079
cubensis um or any kind of psychedelic

3817
02:43:13,879 --> 02:43:19,719
plant uh uh medicine which is really

3818
02:43:17,079 --> 02:43:21,799
awesome and people who are experiencing

3819
02:43:19,719 --> 02:43:24,159
depression you know a lot of really

3820
02:43:21,799 --> 02:43:25,799
super low dosing psychedelic mushroom

3821
02:43:24,159 --> 02:43:30,318
has been really helpful for people too

3822
02:43:25,799 --> 02:43:34,278
and also um also agaron and Corps are

3823
02:43:30,318 --> 02:43:38,439
both very supportive to the lungs so you

3824
02:43:34,279 --> 02:43:40,319
I to use a gacon and Corps in teas and

3825
02:43:38,439 --> 02:43:43,239
ingest that is going to be supportive to

3826
02:43:40,318 --> 02:43:44,519
your lungs and turkey tail as well so

3827
02:43:43,239 --> 02:43:47,000
you know the other thing that I was

3828
02:43:44,520 --> 02:43:49,159
saying just really quickly is that we

3829
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:52,040
were talking with Wade yesterday with

3830
02:43:49,159 --> 02:43:53,959
tricks uh and potent ponics on his

3831
02:43:52,040 --> 02:43:54,880
awesome live broadcast that he did all

3832
02:43:53,959 --> 02:43:59,318
day

3833
02:43:54,879 --> 02:44:01,799
yesterday um yeah is that cannabis is

3834
02:43:59,318 --> 02:44:05,239
just such an incred an incredibly

3835
02:44:01,799 --> 02:44:07,719
intelligent being we've been working

3836
02:44:05,239 --> 02:44:09,478
hand inand with this plant for so long

3837
02:44:07,719 --> 02:44:12,278
its intelligence is ours our

3838
02:44:09,478 --> 02:44:16,478
intelligence is it I just really believe

3839
02:44:12,279 --> 02:44:18,880
that those of us who bred 2020 seeds

3840
02:44:16,478 --> 02:44:21,079
it's just incredibly important for us to

3841
02:44:18,879 --> 02:44:24,278
get get out that that

3842
02:44:21,079 --> 02:44:27,920
information this year is so potent it's

3843
02:44:24,279 --> 02:44:31,760
so powerful it's so transformative we're

3844
02:44:27,920 --> 02:44:34,760
in this this state of of new discoveries

3845
02:44:31,760 --> 02:44:36,559
and the cannabis plant is also feeling

3846
02:44:34,760 --> 02:44:39,120
that vibration of us being in the

3847
02:44:36,559 --> 02:44:41,760
gardens every day and then those plants

3848
02:44:39,120 --> 02:44:43,880
that are the seeds that are being bred

3849
02:44:41,760 --> 02:44:46,559
then being popped next year we'll have

3850
02:44:43,879 --> 02:44:50,239
all of the intelligence we'll have maybe

3851
02:44:46,559 --> 02:44:53,159
even all all of the answers to to uh the

3852
02:44:50,239 --> 02:44:55,398
future remedies that we need so it's so

3853
02:44:53,159 --> 02:44:57,079
important to just keep popping that

3854
02:44:55,398 --> 02:45:00,398
those seeds especially the ones that we

3855
02:44:57,079 --> 02:45:03,478
made this year I'll end it yeah I gotta

3856
02:45:00,398 --> 02:45:06,278
say uh just with you saying about the

3857
02:45:03,478 --> 02:45:07,920
seeds created this year all that stuff

3858
02:45:06,279 --> 02:45:09,200
uh you know the last two seasons it kind

3859
02:45:07,920 --> 02:45:12,239
of got away

3860
02:45:09,200 --> 02:45:15,319
from kind of what Joey taught me with

3861
02:45:12,239 --> 02:45:16,439
this big seed starts start early they're

3862
02:45:15,318 --> 02:45:19,159
overall they're generally going to be

3863
02:45:16,439 --> 02:45:21,840
healthier more bug resistant and got

3864
02:45:19,159 --> 02:45:24,520
into a scene that really we really had

3865
02:45:21,840 --> 02:45:26,200
to make it kind of make money as you

3866
02:45:24,520 --> 02:45:27,640
guys know we need to pay our bills and

3867
02:45:26,200 --> 02:45:29,960
all that stuff so we went more to the

3868
02:45:27,639 --> 02:45:31,799
depth thing and this year I talked my

3869
02:45:29,959 --> 02:45:33,759
partner and hey let's let's clear a

3870
02:45:31,799 --> 02:45:38,159
little area and do some big full terms

3871
02:45:33,760 --> 02:45:41,159
again and I gotta say just with again

3872
02:45:38,159 --> 02:45:44,000
with all the crap that goes on I'm fully

3873
02:45:41,159 --> 02:45:45,959
sold on big seed starts again and

3874
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:47,879
starting from seed and like you say they

3875
02:45:45,959 --> 02:45:50,239
have all that knowledge now of this year

3876
02:45:47,879 --> 02:45:53,959
and what what's that going to be

3877
02:45:50,239 --> 02:45:55,680
advantageous for us in the future if you

3878
02:45:53,959 --> 02:45:57,278
know the Cannabis starts figuring out on

3879
02:45:55,680 --> 02:45:59,120
its own hey I need to finish earlier

3880
02:45:57,279 --> 02:46:01,200
because it's going to be Smoky as hell

3881
02:45:59,120 --> 02:46:03,079
like and there's got to be genetic

3882
02:46:01,200 --> 02:46:05,359
coding on the evolution that says that

3883
02:46:03,079 --> 02:46:08,159
the cannabis plant has lived through

3884
02:46:05,359 --> 02:46:11,318
fire and its Evolution like there's

3885
02:46:08,159 --> 02:46:14,959
probably important tpin that come out in

3886
02:46:11,318 --> 02:46:16,439
it protecting itself from Ash I mean who

3887
02:46:14,959 --> 02:46:19,278
right Mark I mean

3888
02:46:16,439 --> 02:46:22,720
there's actually actually so the one

3889
02:46:19,279 --> 02:46:26,239
thing I do know is that after a forest

3890
02:46:22,719 --> 02:46:30,159
fire um what sort of comes out of the

3891
02:46:26,239 --> 02:46:31,959
ash from the forest the Brea of forest

3892
02:46:30,159 --> 02:46:34,039
is there's a compound that's that fits

3893
02:46:31,959 --> 02:46:37,719
into a class of compounds called

3894
02:46:34,040 --> 02:46:42,640
butenolides and this particular

3895
02:46:37,719 --> 02:46:44,719
butino is actually one that um enhances

3896
02:46:42,639 --> 02:46:47,119
seed germination and it totally makes

3897
02:46:44,719 --> 02:46:49,959
sense from a natural perspective point

3898
02:46:47,120 --> 02:46:52,560
of view so after for fire happens what

3899
02:46:49,959 --> 02:46:55,519
happens there's a whole rebirth in the

3900
02:46:52,559 --> 02:46:57,879
forest well when it turns out that the

3901
02:46:55,520 --> 02:46:59,760
compounds that are in the soot are

3902
02:46:57,879 --> 02:47:02,478
actually the compounds that actually

3903
02:46:59,760 --> 02:47:05,079
encourage seed germination it kind of

3904
02:47:02,478 --> 02:47:08,358
makes sense it's Mother Nature using her

3905
02:47:05,079 --> 02:47:11,719
own chemistry set to sort of enhance you

3906
02:47:08,359 --> 02:47:13,318
know the replacement of the of the force

3907
02:47:11,719 --> 02:47:17,679
and you get the fire

3908
02:47:13,318 --> 02:47:20,079
weed he had a fire fire I no like fire

3909
02:47:17,680 --> 02:47:22,520
weed is the pink plant that grows after

3910
02:47:20,079 --> 02:47:25,000
forest fires it's it's one of the first

3911
02:47:22,520 --> 02:47:27,239
plants that comes up yeah it should be a

3912
02:47:25,000 --> 02:47:28,959
huge year for morel's next spring and

3913
02:47:27,239 --> 02:47:31,119
just because you're bringing that up

3914
02:47:28,959 --> 02:47:33,079
which is really odd is I found that the

3915
02:47:31,120 --> 02:47:34,920
that the Cannabis aphid the bong aphid

3916
02:47:33,079 --> 02:47:37,920
the only other plant that they as

3917
02:47:34,920 --> 02:47:41,159
interested in a as the cannabis plant is

3918
02:47:37,920 --> 02:47:43,239
the fir Weed really notice that just

3919
02:47:41,159 --> 02:47:45,119
just saying and also you know if we're

3920
02:47:43,239 --> 02:47:47,478
thinking about the plants mitigating

3921
02:47:45,120 --> 02:47:49,319
themselves into the next year what about

3922
02:47:47,478 --> 02:47:51,599
the idea that they're feeling our energy

3923
02:47:49,318 --> 02:47:54,879
every time that we're in the gardens and

3924
02:47:51,600 --> 02:47:57,399
they start mitigating new you know chemo

3925
02:47:54,879 --> 02:48:00,358
types to be able to help us out in the

3926
02:47:57,398 --> 02:48:02,559
Years coming I don't know I just ha I

3927
02:48:00,359 --> 02:48:05,399
just happened to go through Yellowstone

3928
02:48:02,559 --> 02:48:08,359
I think like about uh six to eight

3929
02:48:05,398 --> 02:48:11,840
months after they had some very terrible

3930
02:48:08,359 --> 02:48:13,520
fires there in the early 90s and I think

3931
02:48:11,840 --> 02:48:15,439
I was on dead tour so I'm trying to

3932
02:48:13,520 --> 02:48:18,319
remember what year it was I want to say

3933
02:48:15,439 --> 02:48:19,720
it was ' 92 but it might have been 93

3934
02:48:18,318 --> 02:48:21,920
but um

3935
02:48:19,719 --> 02:48:24,519
what what I remember is that when when

3936
02:48:21,920 --> 02:48:27,159
you look at the areas of the of the

3937
02:48:24,520 --> 02:48:29,439
forest that were scorched by the fire if

3938
02:48:27,159 --> 02:48:32,639
you got down on your hands and knees and

3939
02:48:29,439 --> 02:48:34,920
you looked there was a whole new Forest

3940
02:48:32,639 --> 02:48:38,278
you know what I mean like everything

3941
02:48:34,920 --> 02:48:41,639
that was huge and big was now just small

3942
02:48:38,279 --> 02:48:44,040
like all these low to the ground plants

3943
02:48:41,639 --> 02:48:46,959
were all there and obviously plants that

3944
02:48:44,040 --> 02:48:49,120
were living off of the carbon from the

3945
02:48:46,959 --> 02:48:51,559
soot and all the burnt trees everything

3946
02:48:49,120 --> 02:48:53,479
like that but the forest was just you

3947
02:48:51,559 --> 02:48:55,840
know replenishing itself and kind of

3948
02:48:53,478 --> 02:48:58,079
what we were saying before on whether or

3949
02:48:55,840 --> 02:49:02,279
not it's really climate change or is

3950
02:48:58,079 --> 02:49:04,920
this just the cyclic nature that the the

3951
02:49:02,279 --> 02:49:08,239
fire and the burning of the vegetation

3952
02:49:04,920 --> 02:49:11,398
kind of creates the next soil for the

3953
02:49:08,239 --> 02:49:13,920
next forest and it just is this natural

3954
02:49:11,398 --> 02:49:16,719
cycle and how unfortunate for us people

3955
02:49:13,920 --> 02:49:18,719
like Wade whose house is like right in

3956
02:49:16,719 --> 02:49:20,760
the way of this natural process that

3957
02:49:18,719 --> 02:49:22,840
that's been happening for thousands of

3958
02:49:20,760 --> 02:49:25,359
years and oh by the way now it's

3959
02:49:22,840 --> 02:49:27,559
inconveniencing humans because we're

3960
02:49:25,359 --> 02:49:30,200
putting our homes in these beautiful

3961
02:49:27,559 --> 02:49:32,680
places that this happens

3962
02:49:30,200 --> 02:49:35,000
to that's really true one important

3963
02:49:32,680 --> 02:49:37,479
reflection that I've come across this

3964
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:42,879
year we've talked about before is like

3965
02:49:37,478 --> 02:49:46,159
living outside of major cities and major

3966
02:49:42,879 --> 02:49:50,238
like you cities are toxic you know and

3967
02:49:46,159 --> 02:49:52,119
when they burn that Ash isn't really

3968
02:49:50,238 --> 02:49:54,760
like it's not good you know it's it's

3969
02:49:52,120 --> 02:49:58,600
toxic you know when cars burn and houses

3970
02:49:54,760 --> 02:50:03,398
burn and propane tanks go off that Ash

3971
02:49:58,600 --> 02:50:06,200
is detrimental to us for forest fire Ash

3972
02:50:03,398 --> 02:50:08,559
is isn't so bad I mean it is it's part

3973
02:50:06,200 --> 02:50:11,000
of our natural process that Ash is

3974
02:50:08,559 --> 02:50:12,559
carbon it's going to go in it's part of

3975
02:50:11,000 --> 02:50:15,238
our Evolution I think it's part of what

3976
02:50:12,559 --> 02:50:17,318
we need with the mass sickness and the

3977
02:50:15,238 --> 02:50:19,199
pandemic and and all that that's going

3978
02:50:17,318 --> 02:50:21,680
on is another reason

3979
02:50:19,200 --> 02:50:23,840
why you know cities are you know

3980
02:50:21,680 --> 02:50:26,318
something to be careful of and another

3981
02:50:23,840 --> 02:50:28,760
reason where if if you can make it work

3982
02:50:26,318 --> 02:50:30,559
out in the country and live their life

3983
02:50:28,760 --> 02:50:32,880
even though there's sicknesses out there

3984
02:50:30,559 --> 02:50:35,000
even though there's forest fires making

3985
02:50:32,879 --> 02:50:37,398
it through that is is a healthier

3986
02:50:35,000 --> 02:50:41,120
process and I'm feeling really thankful

3987
02:50:37,398 --> 02:50:43,799
for my country Roots back to the land

3988
02:50:41,120 --> 02:50:46,399
decisions right now even though I know

3989
02:50:43,799 --> 02:50:47,358
that we are in the forest and Anything

3990
02:50:46,398 --> 02:50:50,159
could

3991
02:50:47,359 --> 02:50:54,359
happen I'm still allying

3992
02:50:50,159 --> 02:50:56,600
with natural uh compounds and I'm

3993
02:50:54,359 --> 02:50:59,559
feeling really healthy from it and I'm

3994
02:50:56,600 --> 02:51:01,760
feeling for those people who are not um

3995
02:50:59,559 --> 02:51:04,238
but as a or people that don't have the

3996
02:51:01,760 --> 02:51:07,680
choice because you know we've been set

3997
02:51:04,238 --> 02:51:09,318
up for you know 100 plus years 200 years

3998
02:51:07,680 --> 02:51:11,079
that you know now people have their

3999
02:51:09,318 --> 02:51:14,039
roots in the cities and that's where now

4000
02:51:11,079 --> 02:51:16,559
culture is so that's really important I

4001
02:51:14,040 --> 02:51:18,960
guess we just have to see both sides of

4002
02:51:16,559 --> 02:51:20,959
it serve their purpose I go to cities

4003
02:51:18,959 --> 02:51:23,478
cities are you know but I just recognize

4004
02:51:20,959 --> 02:51:25,639
like there's a point of Health that

4005
02:51:23,478 --> 02:51:28,478
comes from living on on the land even

4006
02:51:25,639 --> 02:51:30,920
with fires burning and things but you

4007
02:51:28,478 --> 02:51:33,119
know and also smoke travels you guys we

4008
02:51:30,920 --> 02:51:36,478
could we didn't see the Sun up here in

4009
02:51:33,120 --> 02:51:39,359
BC for over a week like a week and a

4010
02:51:36,478 --> 02:51:42,119
half we had a big orange Globe because

4011
02:51:39,359 --> 02:51:44,800
of all of the fires down in Oregon and

4012
02:51:42,120 --> 02:51:48,040
California and Washington and Washington

4013
02:51:44,799 --> 02:51:50,000
so we were down Washington too and we

4014
02:51:48,040 --> 02:51:51,520
didn't really any fires around us at all

4015
02:51:50,000 --> 02:51:54,439
and we couldn't see the bottom of our

4016
02:51:51,520 --> 02:51:57,680
field so you know just like how our

4017
02:51:54,439 --> 02:52:00,000
Collective Consciousness we are all um

4018
02:51:57,680 --> 02:52:03,238
connected we're also all connected in

4019
02:52:00,000 --> 02:52:04,959
this microbiome that we call Earth so

4020
02:52:03,238 --> 02:52:06,639
you know the smoke that's happening down

4021
02:52:04,959 --> 02:52:09,199
in California is the smoke that I'm

4022
02:52:06,639 --> 02:52:11,199
breathing up here we're all in it

4023
02:52:09,200 --> 02:52:14,239
together and we always like to separate

4024
02:52:11,200 --> 02:52:17,239
ourselves that we are not in it together

4025
02:52:14,238 --> 02:52:19,238
but the smokes and and that are

4026
02:52:17,238 --> 02:52:21,639
happening over in China or over in

4027
02:52:19,238 --> 02:52:24,039
Siberia that went on forever and ever of

4028
02:52:21,639 --> 02:52:25,599
course are affecting all of us so and

4029
02:52:24,040 --> 02:52:27,439
it's it's important to recognize just

4030
02:52:25,600 --> 02:52:30,479
South of the Border Whole Town's burnt

4031
02:52:27,439 --> 02:52:30,479
down from

4032
02:52:32,159 --> 02:52:38,600
Spokan Central Washington all the way

4033
02:52:36,520 --> 02:52:43,200
through Oregon all the way through

4034
02:52:38,600 --> 02:52:46,880
California I mean probably close to

4035
02:52:43,200 --> 02:52:49,319
seven or eight million Acres of burnt in

4036
02:52:46,879 --> 02:52:52,398
the last month on

4037
02:52:49,318 --> 02:52:54,719
what um air in North America up here in

4038
02:52:52,398 --> 02:52:56,559
Vancouver it's I was I'm out of R ises

4039
02:52:54,719 --> 02:52:58,119
you can't see 15t in front of you it's

4040
02:52:56,559 --> 02:52:59,478
hard to breathe up here and you're

4041
02:52:58,120 --> 02:53:00,920
talking about those headaches and stuff

4042
02:52:59,478 --> 02:53:02,679
like that I'm starting to really

4043
02:53:00,920 --> 02:53:04,719
associate the headaches and how I just

4044
02:53:02,680 --> 02:53:06,840
been so down the last couple weeks and

4045
02:53:04,719 --> 02:53:09,639
stuff it's hard to breathe out here I'm

4046
02:53:06,840 --> 02:53:11,960
in avford and uh it's it's it's right

4047
02:53:09,639 --> 02:53:13,599
now you look outside coming home last

4048
02:53:11,959 --> 02:53:15,959
night through Manny Park and stuff like

4049
02:53:13,600 --> 02:53:18,279
that you can just smell it just like

4050
02:53:15,959 --> 02:53:19,559
it's it's bad it is the smoke is bad up

4051
02:53:18,279 --> 02:53:21,200
here

4052
02:53:19,559 --> 02:53:23,000
so take a lot of the advice you guys are

4053
02:53:21,200 --> 02:53:24,239
talking about about those supplements

4054
02:53:23,000 --> 02:53:25,920
and stuff like that I didn't really

4055
02:53:24,238 --> 02:53:27,199
think about that but uh there's

4056
02:53:25,920 --> 02:53:31,639
definitely a lot of smoke in the air up

4057
02:53:27,200 --> 02:53:33,399
here that's for sure Cava Cava um you

4058
02:53:31,639 --> 02:53:35,119
yeah we we all a lot of us you know

4059
02:53:33,398 --> 02:53:37,278
we're all outlying with cannabis and

4060
02:53:35,120 --> 02:53:39,920
it's wonderful it's a great analogic

4061
02:53:37,279 --> 02:53:43,359
it's very helpful but you know kavak

4062
02:53:39,920 --> 02:53:45,478
Caba is a wonderful nervine it really

4063
02:53:43,359 --> 02:53:47,200
helps sort of coat the end of our nerves

4064
02:53:45,478 --> 02:53:49,599
that are sort of fray you know that

4065
02:53:47,200 --> 02:53:52,159
feeling of feeling braid and at the end

4066
02:53:49,600 --> 02:53:54,600
of your rope we use that term all the

4067
02:53:52,159 --> 02:53:57,039
time I'm at the end of my rope well

4068
02:53:54,600 --> 02:53:59,600
that's your nerves talking your nerves

4069
02:53:57,040 --> 02:54:02,920
are literally at the end of their rope

4070
02:53:59,600 --> 02:54:05,840
so allying with cabak Cava and not just

4071
02:54:02,920 --> 02:54:07,760
smoking cannabis but also ingesting it

4072
02:54:05,840 --> 02:54:09,880
when we ingest it it's much more of a

4073
02:54:07,760 --> 02:54:11,760
nervine it helps coat the end of the

4074
02:54:09,879 --> 02:54:16,119
nerves so and

4075
02:54:11,760 --> 02:54:20,318
algae Mis Mis soup thank you thank you

4076

hn that's yeah I use Ava and miso to get

4077
02:54:20,318 --> 02:54:25,159
away from my golf War syndrome because I

4078
02:54:22,040 --> 02:54:27,720
was dealing with a over toxis body so I

4079
02:54:25,159 --> 02:54:30,079
studied on what they used in Hiroshima

4080
02:54:27,719 --> 02:54:34,959
Nagasaki and that's what they use they

4081
02:54:30,079 --> 02:54:37,200
used um you know uh especially miso soup

4082
02:54:34,959 --> 02:54:39,358

4106
02:55:36,040 --> 02:55:41,080
uh since we're talking about fires and I

4107
02:55:39,159 --> 02:55:44,119
see comments over here in the comment

4108
02:55:41,079 --> 02:55:46,359
thing is all the orgon outdoor trash is

4109
02:55:44,120 --> 02:55:49,000
all the Cali weed

4110
02:55:46,359 --> 02:55:52,000
trash I don't think so

4111
02:55:49,000 --> 02:55:54,040
you know uh the the first year I moved

4112
02:55:52,000 --> 02:55:55,760
out here the first time I went into a

4113
02:55:54,040 --> 02:55:58,560
dispensary was right after all the fires

4114
02:55:55,760 --> 02:56:01,439
in Calas and I gotta say every single

4115
02:55:58,559 --> 02:56:03,318
jar of weed I smelled smelled like smoke

4116
02:56:01,439 --> 02:56:05,120
I don't know what happened there that

4117
02:56:03,318 --> 02:56:08,439
that happened but I've never seen that

4118
02:56:05,120 --> 02:56:11,840
since I've seen cannabis

4119
02:56:08,439 --> 02:56:15,079
completely smoked the hell out and come

4120
02:56:11,840 --> 02:56:17,719
off the line smelling and tasting just

4121
02:56:15,079 --> 02:56:20,478
fine uh I know a lot of people are going

4122
02:56:17,719 --> 02:56:24,679
to go into the peroxide and lemon juice

4123
02:56:20,478 --> 02:56:27,559
and baking soda dips this year uh

4124
02:56:24,680 --> 02:56:30,359
personally if it I'm I'm not sure where

4125
02:56:27,559 --> 02:56:32,840
I am on how clean the Cannabis is coming

4126
02:56:30,359 --> 02:56:35,960
out of these fires if it's not treated

4127
02:56:32,840 --> 02:56:39,000
versus treated and if if it's something

4128
02:56:35,959 --> 02:56:42,199
that we really need to concern ourselves

4129
02:56:39,000 --> 02:56:44,079
with or if it's kind of one of those you

4130
02:56:42,200 --> 02:56:46,479
know you're already combusting something

4131
02:56:44,079 --> 02:56:49,279
you're already smoking something that

4132
02:56:46,478 --> 02:56:51,079
you know cannabis has it it's you know

4133
02:56:49,279 --> 02:56:52,520
positive medical effects but let's be

4134
02:56:51,079 --> 02:56:55,639
honest you are doing damage to your

4135
02:56:52,520 --> 02:56:58,439
lungs by doing that what else are we

4136
02:56:55,639 --> 02:57:00,199
ingesting by smoking that cannabis that

4137
02:56:58,439 --> 02:57:03,880
is out in those fields I personally

4138
02:57:00,200 --> 02:57:06,720
don't feel it's ruined I in 2017 with

4139
02:57:03,879 --> 02:57:08,478
the San Roa fires we had stuff that got

4140
02:57:06,719 --> 02:57:10,639
ashed we had stuff that didn't get ashed

4141
02:57:08,478 --> 02:57:14,079
we had stuff that had smoke no smoke all

4142
02:57:10,639 --> 02:57:16,119
that we did multiple different ways of

4143
02:57:14,079 --> 02:57:18,439
harvesting we did the dip on some stuff

4144
02:57:16,120 --> 02:57:20,520
we didn't do the dip on some stuff we

4145
02:57:18,439 --> 02:57:23,439
washed some stuff we didn't wash some

4146
02:57:20,520 --> 02:57:25,960
stuff we had all of that stuff tested

4147
02:57:23,439 --> 02:57:28,159
and we had a very clean results come

4148
02:57:25,959 --> 02:57:30,959
back that year we had a few you know you

4149
02:57:28,159 --> 02:57:34,200
get the OD

4150
02:57:30,959 --> 02:57:35,519
ones like oh chloroform or whatever and

4151
02:57:34,200 --> 02:57:37,680
they tell you just send it back in and

4152
02:57:35,520 --> 02:57:39,000
retest it and it came back clean so I've

4153
02:57:37,680 --> 02:57:41,279
kind of always been the mod of thinking

4154
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:42,600
that it's it's not doing as much damage

4155
02:57:41,279 --> 02:57:44,840
I think as the end consumer kind of

4156
02:57:42,600 --> 02:57:46,800
thinks you know they all just thinks uh

4157
02:57:44,840 --> 02:57:48,680
barbecue OG and all that crap and that

4158
02:57:46,799 --> 02:57:50,000
we're smoking poison I don't don't know

4159
02:57:48,680 --> 02:57:52,398
I don't know if any of you guys have any

4160
02:57:50,000 --> 02:57:55,520
more insight on

4161
02:57:52,398 --> 02:57:58,238
that I agree with you the ash that the

4162
02:57:55,520 --> 02:58:03,840
ash that falls what's falling if it's

4163
02:57:58,238 --> 02:58:06,600
Ash onto the plant itself is typically

4164
02:58:03,840 --> 02:58:09,639
just just you know again very very light

4165
02:58:06,600 --> 02:58:12,159
mineral content and very very little you

4166
02:58:09,639 --> 02:58:14,079
know in terms of toxicity the toxicity

4167
02:58:12,159 --> 02:58:17,039
and what we were you know referring to

4168
02:58:14,079 --> 02:58:20,318
before is the way that these a city fire

4169
02:58:17,040 --> 02:58:22,880
would smell as opposed to say like a

4170
02:58:20,318 --> 02:58:26,519
country fire where in the country you

4171
02:58:22,879 --> 02:58:28,398
might just be burning brush in a c or

4172
02:58:26,520 --> 02:58:29,800
something like that we're in a city

4173
02:58:28,398 --> 02:58:33,599
there's probably going to be like a lot

4174
02:58:29,799 --> 02:58:36,119
of a trash the the bad part of of smoke

4175
02:58:33,600 --> 02:58:39,600
the thing that can cont contaminate

4176
02:58:36,120 --> 02:58:41,479
cannabis would be what's in the soot and

4177
02:58:39,600 --> 02:58:44,800
what's in the soot there's a class of

4178
02:58:41,478 --> 02:58:47,159
compounds called polycyclic aromatic

4179
02:58:44,799 --> 02:58:49,438
hydrocarbons and these are like some of

4180
02:58:47,159 --> 02:58:53,159
the most toxic

4181
02:58:49,439 --> 02:58:55,880
hydrocarbons known to man but

4182
02:58:53,159 --> 02:58:58,719
ironically this is part of the the

4183
02:58:55,879 --> 02:59:00,959
barbecued flavor that that people love

4184
02:58:58,719 --> 02:59:04,719
like if you like barbecued brisket or

4185
02:59:00,959 --> 02:59:06,759
smoked brisket or if you like you not to

4186
02:59:04,719 --> 02:59:09,398
talk about the meat diet again markets

4187
02:59:06,760 --> 02:59:11,478
but if you like charcoal grilled food

4188
02:59:09,398 --> 02:59:13,840
those black stripes on your steak and

4189
02:59:11,478 --> 02:59:17,799
everything like that where it actually

4190
02:59:13,840 --> 02:59:20,279
caramelizes a lot of that um degradation

4191
02:59:17,799 --> 02:59:23,079
you sugar degradation and whatnot

4192
02:59:20,279 --> 02:59:24,960
pyrolysis ends up with these polycyclic

4193
02:59:23,079 --> 02:59:27,279
aromatic hydrocarbons which are really

4194
02:59:24,959 --> 02:59:29,839
toxic and that's why you could probably

4195
02:59:27,279 --> 02:59:32,359
go to a Burger King go scrape those

4196
02:59:29,840 --> 02:59:34,880
black lines off the hamburger send it to

4197
02:59:32,359 --> 02:59:37,439
a lab go show that there's polycylic

4198
02:59:34,879 --> 02:59:39,238
aromatic hydrocarbons in there and shut

4199
02:59:37,439 --> 02:59:42,479
down Burger King because they're selling

4200
02:59:39,238 --> 02:59:45,119
toxic hamburgers because but that's part

4201
02:59:42,478 --> 02:59:48,760
of the grilled taste that humans love so

4202
02:59:45,120 --> 02:59:51,800
much so you know yeah but but Mark

4203
02:59:48,760 --> 02:59:54,960
with cannabis that's not part of the

4204
02:59:51,799 --> 02:59:58,000
taste and smell that we love if you

4205
02:59:54,959 --> 03:00:01,398
taste smell it I wouldn't smoke

4206
02:59:58,000 --> 03:00:03,600
it no no no yeah I'm just talking about

4207
03:00:01,398 --> 03:00:07,199
like the elements of fire mixing with

4208
03:00:03,600 --> 03:00:10,120
cannabis and where where no I I agree

4209
03:00:07,200 --> 03:00:13,520
you remember I I love a good burger or a

4210
03:00:10,120 --> 03:00:15,960
good steak and I like them grilled so I

4211
03:00:13,520 --> 03:00:19,640
know exactly what you're talking about

4212
03:00:15,959 --> 03:00:23,478
and say love e but with cannabis I got a

4213
03:00:19,639 --> 03:00:26,439
choice and uh if I can smell it or taste

4214
03:00:23,478 --> 03:00:28,478
it meaning the fires I don't want that

4215
03:00:26,439 --> 03:00:30,600
cannabis product yeah I mean I got to

4216
03:00:28,478 --> 03:00:32,159
agree if it smells like smoke I mean

4217
03:00:30,600 --> 03:00:33,800
nobody's gonna want it I'm talking the

4218
03:00:32,159 --> 03:00:36,559
stuff that comes out and doesn't smell

4219
03:00:33,799 --> 03:00:38,238
like smoke you know so like when we were

4220
03:00:36,559 --> 03:00:39,840
talking about this on hash Church a

4221
03:00:38,238 --> 03:00:41,799
couple years ago when fires were

4222
03:00:39,840 --> 03:00:43,960
happening in California I thought what I

4223
03:00:41,799 --> 03:00:45,959
remember and the nice thing about hash

4224
03:00:43,959 --> 03:00:48,238
church we can go back and watch him now

4225
03:00:45,959 --> 03:00:50,000
and go listen to that is I think the a

4226
03:00:48,238 --> 03:00:51,840
couple episodes where oh my God there's

4227
03:00:50,000 --> 03:00:53,799
all these fires there's going to be all

4228
03:00:51,840 --> 03:00:55,639
this Smoky weed and then a couple

4229
03:00:53,799 --> 03:00:57,759
episodes later where yeah there's a

4230
03:00:55,639 --> 03:00:59,959
bunch of smoky weed out on the market to

4231
03:00:57,760 --> 03:01:03,520
a couple episodes later to where hey it

4232
03:00:59,959 --> 03:01:06,278
makes really good fire oil you know to

4233
03:01:03,520 --> 03:01:10,319
where again you know if you're making

4234
03:01:06,279 --> 03:01:12,720
dlit you're GNA purify any smokiness out

4235
03:01:10,318 --> 03:01:14,879
of the dlit I'm not saying that all that

4236
03:01:12,719 --> 03:01:17,318
material was destined for disate and

4237
03:01:14,879 --> 03:01:18,969
certainly I think the way that most the

4238
03:01:17,318 --> 03:01:20,879
economics the most

4239
03:01:18,969 --> 03:01:23,879
[Music]

4240
03:01:20,879 --> 03:01:26,079
grow would be like you want to sell your

4241
03:01:23,879 --> 03:01:27,679
premium flour your best flour at a

4242
03:01:26,079 --> 03:01:29,520
different rate than you want to sell say

4243
03:01:27,680 --> 03:01:31,760
like your bulk biomass which is just

4244
03:01:29,520 --> 03:01:35,200
going for for distillate or just oil

4245
03:01:31,760 --> 03:01:37,680
formation you know for for Rick Simpson

4246
03:01:35,200 --> 03:01:40,520
type oils or things again where maybe

4247
03:01:37,680 --> 03:01:42,880
flavor really doesn't matter but those

4248
03:01:40,520 --> 03:01:46,200
you know canabo are still going to be in

4249
03:01:42,879 --> 03:01:49,799
there you know in some cruds there's

4250
03:01:46,200 --> 03:01:52,279
almost like a y flavor right waade I

4251
03:01:49,799 --> 03:01:54,639
mean I've tasted some cruds that almost

4252
03:01:52,279 --> 03:01:57,520
have like I would say a smokey Essence

4253
03:01:54,639 --> 03:02:00,278
to it but maybe like a a somewhat of

4254
03:01:57,520 --> 03:02:01,960
like a burnt Essence to it where maybe

4255
03:02:00,279 --> 03:02:04,680
in the way that they're recovering their

4256
03:02:01,959 --> 03:02:07,679
solvent from their extraction actually

4257
03:02:04,680 --> 03:02:10,159
kind of like put some kind of like burnt

4258
03:02:07,680 --> 03:02:12,079
flavor into the oil itself it's still

4259
03:02:10,159 --> 03:02:14,398
effective and I still think you could

4260
03:02:12,079 --> 03:02:16,799
make capsules out of it and cancer

4261
03:02:14,398 --> 03:02:18,840
patients could still use that oil so

4262
03:02:16,799 --> 03:02:22,278
just to answer your question I mean I I

4263
03:02:18,840 --> 03:02:25,960
I don't know that again the burnt all

4264
03:02:22,279 --> 03:02:28,800
the premonition that oh any weed that's

4265
03:02:25,959 --> 03:02:31,559
grown in a fire ridden zone is just

4266
03:02:28,799 --> 03:02:33,478
ridden off as not being good or as

4267
03:02:31,559 --> 03:02:36,159
valuable as it would be

4268
03:02:33,478 --> 03:02:38,920
otherwise I think the fire has to be

4269
03:02:36,159 --> 03:02:42,318
like within a mile of your property and

4270
03:02:38,920 --> 03:02:44,559
dumping [ __ ] Ash on your weed like in

4271
03:02:42,318 --> 03:02:47,478
that case you know I mean that's going

4272
03:02:44,559 --> 03:02:50,639
to be tough to to get that off but right

4273
03:02:47,478 --> 03:02:52,398
when it has a chance to get somewhat

4274
03:02:50,639 --> 03:02:54,840
cleansed in the atmosphere I'm sure

4275
03:02:52,398 --> 03:02:57,119
there's some molecular change that's

4276
03:02:54,840 --> 03:02:59,120
happening in the atmosphere even you

4277
03:02:57,120 --> 03:03:01,479
know when it's you know but if you're

4278
03:02:59,120 --> 03:03:03,560
next to a crowning fire I mean my

4279
03:03:01,478 --> 03:03:06,639
goodness you know what what can you

4280
03:03:03,559 --> 03:03:11,159
expect but I think when it has a chance

4281
03:03:06,639 --> 03:03:14,278
to to fill up the atmosphere and the odd

4282
03:03:11,159 --> 03:03:16,238
ashes falling which is probably still

4283
03:03:14,279 --> 03:03:17,920
the majority of people although this

4284
03:03:16,238 --> 03:03:21,159
year is a unique year we'll see what

4285
03:03:17,920 --> 03:03:24,439
happens but I think you're right to say

4286
03:03:21,159 --> 03:03:28,119
definitely a lot of it's good s is so is

4287
03:03:24,439 --> 03:03:31,359
usually black soot would have like s

4288
03:03:28,120 --> 03:03:33,640
think of soot is kind of like the the

4289
03:03:31,359 --> 03:03:35,479
component that is left on the inside of

4290
03:03:33,639 --> 03:03:37,719
your chimney that's why you have to get

4291
03:03:35,478 --> 03:03:39,959
your chimney clean because when soot

4292
03:03:37,719 --> 03:03:42,478
builds up there essentially it could

4293
03:03:39,959 --> 03:03:46,639
basically just be you know

4294
03:03:42,478 --> 03:03:49,199
flammable later later on but it's oily

4295
03:03:46,639 --> 03:03:52,920
yeah EX exctly it's oily it's kind of

4296
03:03:49,200 --> 03:03:56,960
like it's kind of like it's s Creo right

4297
03:03:52,920 --> 03:03:58,879
so Ash is different like ash um again if

4298
03:03:56,959 --> 03:04:02,919
you were to do the it's

4299
03:03:58,879 --> 03:04:05,318
absorbable yeah ex different way exactly

4300
03:04:02,920 --> 03:04:08,680
I I I don't think Ash is as much of an

4301
03:04:05,318 --> 03:04:11,920
issue as if your plants are kind of in

4302
03:04:08,680 --> 03:04:16,559
an area where they're getting fumigated

4303
03:04:11,920 --> 03:04:19,559
with the syy flames and effluent of a

4304
03:04:16,559 --> 03:04:22,398
fire does does that make sense

4305
03:04:19,559 --> 03:04:24,278
right hey Mark would it be like spraying

4306
03:04:22,398 --> 03:04:27,278
geranium oil and then letting that kind

4307
03:04:24,279 --> 03:04:29,479
of happen you know naturally and break

4308
03:04:27,279 --> 03:04:32,760
down naturally and then it would just

4309
03:04:29,478 --> 03:04:34,760
the the the smell goes away and it

4310
03:04:32,760 --> 03:04:36,559
breaks down over time and I would

4311
03:04:34,760 --> 03:04:39,359
imagine similar things are happening

4312
03:04:36,559 --> 03:04:41,398
with with light Ash I I've had no

4313
03:04:39,359 --> 03:04:43,000
reports from anyone that I'm close with

4314
03:04:41,398 --> 03:04:46,760
that they've had any

4315
03:04:43,000 --> 03:04:49,120
Smoky I mean leaf leaf microbes are

4316
03:04:46,760 --> 03:04:51,639
still eating things that land on the

4317
03:04:49,120 --> 03:04:54,439
leaf so if you have an opportunity like

4318
03:04:51,639 --> 03:04:56,439
those plants are still growing and if

4319
03:04:54,439 --> 03:04:58,318
they the fire went away then I believe

4320
03:04:56,439 --> 03:04:59,920
you know then the plant the stada and

4321
03:04:58,318 --> 03:05:02,600
everything you know every minute of

4322
03:04:59,920 --> 03:05:04,559
every day is consuming what's on the

4323
03:05:02,600 --> 03:05:06,720
leaf so I the plant does have the

4324
03:05:04,559 --> 03:05:08,840
ability to consume a lot of and we do

4325
03:05:06,719 --> 03:05:11,438
know that during fire and when there's a

4326
03:05:08,840 --> 03:05:13,478
lot of Ash that the cyanobacteria on the

4327
03:05:11,439 --> 03:05:16,238
surface of the leaf you know

4328
03:05:13,478 --> 03:05:18,920
exponentially doubles triples it you

4329
03:05:16,238 --> 03:05:22,639
know it starts to grow because there is

4330
03:05:18,920 --> 03:05:25,359
so much dust for it to consume so I do

4331
03:05:22,639 --> 03:05:27,959
think that there's a you know some some

4332
03:05:25,359 --> 03:05:32,279
type of a homeostasis balance that

4333
03:05:27,959 --> 03:05:33,799
happens and let's with outdoor uh flour

4334
03:05:32,279 --> 03:05:35,800
also one thing that I wanted to say

4335
03:05:33,799 --> 03:05:37,000
that's super easy for people to

4336
03:05:35,799 --> 03:05:40,639
understand when we were talking about

4337
03:05:37,000 --> 03:05:42,680
City fire and and forest fire is that

4338
03:05:40,639 --> 03:05:45,639
the smoke coming off of City fire is

4339
03:05:42,680 --> 03:05:48,680
carbon monoxide the smoke coming off of

4340
03:05:45,639 --> 03:05:51,278
a forest fire is carbon dioxide side big

4341
03:05:48,680 --> 03:05:53,520
difference so that's sort of well

4342
03:05:51,279 --> 03:05:53,520
they're

4343
03:05:54,000 --> 03:05:59,478
both they're both there who's telling

4344
03:05:56,520 --> 03:06:01,279
you that who said that to you i' I've

4345
03:05:59,478 --> 03:06:05,679
heard that is that not true that there's

4346
03:06:01,279 --> 03:06:09,399
more carbon monoxide in City air no

4347
03:06:05,680 --> 03:06:13,680
combustion makes both CO2 and and and

4348
03:06:09,398 --> 03:06:16,119
and and Co I I think yeah I I I I've

4349
03:06:13,680 --> 03:06:19,960
yeah there's no rational basis for that

4350
03:06:16,120 --> 03:06:19,960
chemistry wise so combustion you

4351
03:06:21,439 --> 03:06:28,680
Mar what about atmospheric carbon coming

4352
03:06:26,238 --> 03:06:31,920
yeah so there's no in the air there

4353
03:06:28,680 --> 03:06:36,800
wouldn't be like some type of you know

4354
03:06:31,920 --> 03:06:39,478
City toxicity in the Smoke yes there is

4355
03:06:36,799 --> 03:06:42,679
from plastic

4356
03:06:39,478 --> 03:06:45,159
and that's kind of what right like like

4357
03:06:42,680 --> 03:06:48,000
if if my laptop here were to fall into a

4358
03:06:45,159 --> 03:06:50,478
fire and start burning uh most of this

4359
03:06:48,000 --> 03:06:53,359
plastic is a thermoplastic called well

4360
03:06:50,478 --> 03:06:55,840
it's vinyl which is poly Vinyl chloride

4361
03:06:53,359 --> 03:06:58,520
so when poly Vinyl chloride or when

4362
03:06:55,840 --> 03:07:00,680
styrene all the conventional Plastics

4363
03:06:58,520 --> 03:07:03,640
multiple Plastics that we use when those

4364
03:07:00,680 --> 03:07:06,760
things burn yeah they give off basically

4365
03:07:03,639 --> 03:07:10,199
they thermally degrade and give off very

4366
03:07:06,760 --> 03:07:11,960
noxious soots and particulates that you

4367
03:07:10,200 --> 03:07:14,560
don't want to be breathing in that's

4368
03:07:11,959 --> 03:07:17,119
absolutely true no question about it I

4369
03:07:14,559 --> 03:07:19,680
don't think it's down to the co CO2

4370
03:07:17,120 --> 03:07:22,000
mixture here it just down on what you're

4371
03:07:19,680 --> 03:07:24,479
burning a lot of that stuff again

4372
03:07:22,000 --> 03:07:27,318
especially the polymers what happens is

4373
03:07:24,478 --> 03:07:28,920
as they burn the neighboring polymer

4374
03:07:27,318 --> 03:07:30,959
next to it so if this part of the

4375
03:07:28,920 --> 03:07:33,478
plastic is burning this part of the

4376
03:07:30,959 --> 03:07:35,759
plastic is melting and vaporizing that's

4377
03:07:33,478 --> 03:07:38,079
why when you throw plastic into like a

4378
03:07:35,760 --> 03:07:39,920
campfire you start to see little kind of

4379
03:07:38,079 --> 03:07:43,120
like floaties all over the place and

4380
03:07:39,920 --> 03:07:45,120
everything so and well those toxins join

4381
03:07:43,120 --> 03:07:46,840
together with carbon pieces and and

4382
03:07:45,120 --> 03:07:48,399
chain off you know what they're going to

4383
03:07:46,840 --> 03:07:51,079
do though they're just going to end up

4384
03:07:48,398 --> 03:07:52,559
in the upper atmosphere as just you know

4385
03:07:51,079 --> 03:07:55,760
volatiles that you don't want to be

4386
03:07:52,559 --> 03:07:57,639
burning and you don't uh certainly I saw

4387
03:07:55,760 --> 03:07:59,478
people throwing trash into a fire and

4388
03:07:57,639 --> 03:08:02,278
then cooking marshmallows on there it's

4389
03:07:59,478 --> 03:08:06,438
like oh my God people just you know I

4390
03:08:02,279 --> 03:08:08,800
mean you know part of it is having um

4391
03:08:06,439 --> 03:08:11,520
again this cradle tog grave recognition

4392
03:08:08,799 --> 03:08:13,519
that all the packaging material and

4393
03:08:11,520 --> 03:08:16,479
everything that we throw away into the

4394
03:08:13,520 --> 03:08:19,040
trash a lot of it does get burned and a

4395
03:08:16,478 --> 03:08:21,799
lot of that stuff does have bad effects

4396
03:08:19,040 --> 03:08:23,640
in the environment so yeah since we have

4397
03:08:21,799 --> 03:08:25,159
a chemist in here here's another thing

4398
03:08:23,639 --> 03:08:26,760
I've been talking about that you can

4399
03:08:25,159 --> 03:08:28,159
probably clarify more where there's a

4400
03:08:26,760 --> 03:08:31,520
chemist

4401
03:08:28,159 --> 03:08:33,959
where I I was horrible I was horrible at

4402
03:08:31,520 --> 03:08:36,000
chemistry so like

4403
03:08:33,959 --> 03:08:37,879
horrible the other thing that people

4404
03:08:36,000 --> 03:08:41,120
have been talking about up here on and

4405
03:08:37,879 --> 03:08:43,639
on and on and on is water plus Ash

4406
03:08:41,120 --> 03:08:45,279
equals lie and what's that going to do

4407
03:08:43,639 --> 03:08:47,959
to plants what's that going to do to

4408
03:08:45,279 --> 03:08:50,720
soil I've gotten into a couple

4409
03:08:47,959 --> 03:08:53,599
conversations uh Wendy from sonibus I'm

4410
03:08:50,719 --> 03:08:55,119
sure you guys know Wendy dragonfly and

4411
03:08:53,600 --> 03:08:57,960
uh she's kind of the one that brought

4412
03:08:55,120 --> 03:09:00,319
this up and she shut the comments down

4413
03:08:57,959 --> 03:09:02,719
on her post about it because I think she

4414
03:09:00,318 --> 03:09:05,238
knew it was going to create

4415
03:09:02,719 --> 03:09:08,079
hubub uh first of

4416
03:09:05,238 --> 03:09:10,760
all what kind sort of concentration of

4417
03:09:08,079 --> 03:09:13,159
Ash needs to land soil for it to cause

4418
03:09:10,760 --> 03:09:15,159
an issue and at this point in the season

4419
03:09:13,159 --> 03:09:16,879
my thing was I'm not even concerned

4420
03:09:15,159 --> 03:09:19,000
because my plants are big enough at this

4421
03:09:16,879 --> 03:09:20,438
point there ain't a damn bit of Ash

4422
03:09:19,000 --> 03:09:23,238
hitting the soil underneath them I'm

4423
03:09:20,439 --> 03:09:26,000
sure there is

4424
03:09:23,238 --> 03:09:27,840
obviously it's all as you recognize it's

4425
03:09:26,000 --> 03:09:29,559
all concentration it's all a matter of

4426
03:09:27,840 --> 03:09:31,960
how much of that stuff is there and

4427
03:09:29,559 --> 03:09:34,760
there's so little there that it's never

4428
03:09:31,959 --> 03:09:37,679
going to be able to balance what acid

4429
03:09:34,760 --> 03:09:39,960
rain has done right so acid rain has

4430
03:09:37,680 --> 03:09:42,159
basically moved the pH needle on what

4431
03:09:39,959 --> 03:09:45,799
comes down from the sky almost by a

4432
03:09:42,159 --> 03:09:48,639
whole pH unit in the last 30 years right

4433
03:09:45,799 --> 03:09:51,039
so I mean yeah on the LIE right there's

4434
03:09:48,639 --> 03:09:52,920
a whole lot of acid rting to neutralize

4435
03:09:51,040 --> 03:09:54,840
that was exactly the argument is it was

4436
03:09:52,920 --> 03:09:57,799
going to change the pH in your soil and

4437
03:09:54,840 --> 03:10:00,559
that you need to watch out for that

4438
03:09:57,799 --> 03:10:02,119
probably in a local sense hold on Sam

4439
03:10:00,559 --> 03:10:04,639
let me just add this so if you take a

4440
03:10:02,120 --> 03:10:06,880
bunch of Ash and you add it into your

4441
03:10:04,639 --> 03:10:09,639
grow yeah on a local sense you're going

4442
03:10:06,879 --> 03:10:11,759
to see a swing of pH no question about

4443
03:10:09,639 --> 03:10:13,680
it so lie against some of the components

4444
03:10:11,760 --> 03:10:16,079
in there are like sodium and lithium and

4445
03:10:13,680 --> 03:10:18,120
when they get wet combined with water

4446
03:10:16,079 --> 03:10:20,439
they make hydroxides which is going to

4447
03:10:18,120 --> 03:10:22,920
basically increase the ph and give you a

4448
03:10:20,439 --> 03:10:25,279
more basic pH no question about it just

4449
03:10:22,920 --> 03:10:27,478
like lie would but you know again

4450
03:10:25,279 --> 03:10:29,479
everything's all in you know the stuff's

4451
03:10:27,478 --> 03:10:32,278
floating down from the sky for Christ

4452
03:10:29,478 --> 03:10:34,920
sakes it's not like people are dumping

4453
03:10:32,279 --> 03:10:36,960
pounds of this [ __ ] on your grow right

4454
03:10:34,920 --> 03:10:39,760
that's exactly what I thought now it's

4455
03:10:36,959 --> 03:10:42,000
not Mount St Helens that's all well yeah

4456
03:10:39,760 --> 03:10:45,559
I mean Mount St Helens is yeah I mean

4457
03:10:42,000 --> 03:10:47,719
something like that is going to uh you

4458
03:10:45,559 --> 03:10:51,119
know that was yeah was great there was a

4459
03:10:47,719 --> 03:10:52,840
Grateful Dead show going on in in Eugene

4460
03:10:51,120 --> 03:10:54,600
I think when Mount S I think it was

4461
03:10:52,840 --> 03:10:56,559
Portland Portland I think it was

4462
03:10:54,600 --> 03:10:58,200
Portland like Meadows I think yeah they

4463
03:10:56,559 --> 03:10:59,959
were Fire on the Mountain played Fire on

4464
03:10:58,200 --> 03:11:00,800
the Mountain and there was really Fire

4465
03:10:59,959 --> 03:11:04,438
on the

4466
03:11:00,799 --> 03:11:07,159
Mountain yeah I mean that was um wow I

4467
03:11:04,439 --> 03:11:10,318
mean I I guess in it around and in fact

4468
03:11:07,159 --> 03:11:13,920
a lot of what we know about how

4469
03:11:10,318 --> 03:11:15,639
volcanoes and replenish the ecosystem

4470
03:11:13,920 --> 03:11:18,680
has been some of the publication that's

4471
03:11:15,639 --> 03:11:21,000
come from the science that studied Mount

4472
03:11:18,680 --> 03:11:21,000
St

4473
03:11:21,359 --> 03:11:25,120
Helens and looked at like the

4474
03:11:23,279 --> 03:11:27,479
neighboring areas on how quick it was

4475
03:11:25,120 --> 03:11:29,040
you know terrified back into you know

4476
03:11:27,478 --> 03:11:32,238
organic existence that's what I was

4477
03:11:29,040 --> 03:11:35,680
going to say Mark was that at first on a

4478
03:11:32,238 --> 03:11:38,318
volcano slope nothing will grow for the

4479
03:11:35,680 --> 03:11:41,479
first couple years but after that it

4480
03:11:38,318 --> 03:11:44,439
grows better than the surrounding Farm

4481
03:11:41,478 --> 03:11:47,639
man it does

4482
03:11:44,439 --> 03:11:50,600
yeah yeah there's a whole zoo of micro

4483
03:11:47,639 --> 03:11:53,760
that start inhabiting that and once the

4484
03:11:50,600 --> 03:11:56,159
microbes start I mean Josh and Kelly

4485
03:11:53,760 --> 03:11:59,520
will agree that it creates basically the

4486
03:11:56,159 --> 03:12:03,238
chemistry of soil inside what was just

4487
03:11:59,520 --> 03:12:06,640
an inorganic glassy Rocky substrate

4488
03:12:03,238 --> 03:12:08,559
completely void of life you know it

4489
03:12:06,639 --> 03:12:11,799
takes that thing and just turns it into

4490
03:12:08,559 --> 03:12:14,559
yeah just a sponge and a zoo of of life

4491
03:12:11,799 --> 03:12:18,000
so so [ __ ] cool Mother Nature's

4492
03:12:14,559 --> 03:12:18,000
pretty good chemist

4493
03:12:20,478 --> 03:12:27,000
I I've seen excellent cannabis from

4494
03:12:23,879 --> 03:12:30,920
volcanic soils like in Hawaii and other

4495
03:12:27,000 --> 03:12:30,920
places I I know it

4496
03:12:31,520 --> 03:12:36,359
works I wanted to Circle back to

4497
03:12:33,760 --> 03:12:39,040
something uh that was being offered

4498
03:12:36,359 --> 03:12:42,159
about Ash that settles on

4499
03:12:39,040 --> 03:12:43,960
Plants um over the last couple years

4500
03:12:42,159 --> 03:12:46,200
with the fires in California I've asked

4501
03:12:43,959 --> 03:12:48,278
some of the Growers who had crops out

4502
03:12:46,200 --> 03:12:50,960
when the ash was going on or when they

4503
03:12:48,279 --> 03:12:54,720
were threatened by fire and the folks

4504
03:12:50,959 --> 03:12:56,959
who took their crop down while Ash was

4505
03:12:54,719 --> 03:12:59,559
still falling and they were concerned

4506
03:12:56,959 --> 03:13:01,238
their crop was going to burn or whatnot

4507
03:12:59,559 --> 03:13:04,079
reported

4508
03:13:01,238 --> 03:13:06,279
more problems with their finished

4509
03:13:04,079 --> 03:13:08,238
product versus those who left their

4510
03:13:06,279 --> 03:13:11,560
plants in the ground allowed them to

4511
03:13:08,238 --> 03:13:15,000
continue their life process and

4512
03:13:11,559 --> 03:13:17,398
harvested um after they'd had a chance

4513
03:13:15,000 --> 03:13:19,439
to deal with the ash was something that

4514
03:13:17,398 --> 03:13:20,840
you were saying that I thought I was

4515
03:13:19,439 --> 03:13:22,840
trying to understand how that would work

4516
03:13:20,840 --> 03:13:25,000
but that makes a lot of sense I wondered

4517
03:13:22,840 --> 03:13:28,040
what else folks what were the problems

4518
03:13:25,000 --> 03:13:30,000
that they had a phyto remediation plant

4519
03:13:28,040 --> 03:13:31,840
what kind of problems did they have with

4520
03:13:30,000 --> 03:13:35,920
the material that they took down oh it

4521
03:13:31,840 --> 03:13:39,559
was taste taste and cure uh the The Cure

4522
03:13:35,920 --> 03:13:43,318
uh yeah just didn't work out uh the the

4523
03:13:39,559 --> 03:13:45,238
flour didn't taste nice it had uh it

4524
03:13:43,318 --> 03:13:47,760
burned poorly this was over near Santa

4525
03:13:45,238 --> 03:13:49,879
Rosa when the urban

4526
03:13:47,760 --> 03:13:52,079
area of Santa Rosa burned a couple years

4527
03:13:49,879 --> 03:13:53,639
ago some of the farmers in that area are

4528
03:13:52,079 --> 03:13:55,680
who I was talking to and yeah they were

4529
03:13:53,639 --> 03:13:58,719
trying to save their crop got it down

4530
03:13:55,680 --> 03:14:01,079
and into a drying facility away from the

4531
03:13:58,719 --> 03:14:03,879
fire but we're real disappointed with

4532
03:14:01,079 --> 03:14:06,478
the results whereas some other Farmers

4533
03:14:03,879 --> 03:14:09,159
again not Urban so there's a variable

4534
03:14:06,478 --> 03:14:13,079
that may not be relevant but or it may

4535
03:14:09,159 --> 03:14:17,760
be uh but these were more uh rural

4536
03:14:13,079 --> 03:14:19,719
farmers who let their stuff finish uh

4537
03:14:17,760 --> 03:14:23,359
after the smoke had cleared more or less

4538
03:14:19,719 --> 03:14:26,398
there was not the ashall and whatnot and

4539
03:14:23,359 --> 03:14:27,720
they did with blowers and whatnot and

4540
03:14:26,398 --> 03:14:32,799
they felt like they got a really good

4541
03:14:27,719 --> 03:14:32,799
harvest that year so is there Ash in the

4542
03:14:33,079 --> 03:14:39,200
hash so it turns out leaf blowers leaf

4543
03:14:36,639 --> 03:14:42,199
blowers are good for blowing tear gas

4544
03:14:39,200 --> 03:14:45,800
away from you they're also really good

4545
03:14:42,200 --> 03:14:47,279
at blowing Ash off your weed so wow you

4546
03:14:45,799 --> 03:14:49,559
know leaf blowers are turning out not

4547
03:14:47,279 --> 03:14:51,640
important this year 2020 is like the

4548
03:14:49,559 --> 03:14:54,318
year of the leaf

4549
03:14:51,639 --> 03:14:57,879
blower in the hash I can tell you

4550
03:14:54,318 --> 03:15:00,519
firsthand if there's not too much Ash on

4551
03:14:57,879 --> 03:15:03,639
the starting material it can pretty much

4552
03:15:00,520 --> 03:15:06,000
be washed out and tested clean yeah for

4553
03:15:03,639 --> 03:15:08,680
sure and I think that there is a phyto

4554
03:15:06,000 --> 03:15:12,680
remediation that happens and also I

4555
03:15:08,680 --> 03:15:15,359
would think just you know that when

4556
03:15:12,680 --> 03:15:18,120
you're curing it is such a microbial

4557
03:15:15,359 --> 03:15:20,600
fermentation process that happening if

4558
03:15:18,120 --> 03:15:23,160
your microbiology has changed

4559
03:15:20,600 --> 03:15:25,199
dramatically as like it would after a

4560
03:15:23,159 --> 03:15:27,359
fire and you had a tremendous amount of

4561
03:15:25,199 --> 03:15:29,680
Ash then you're GNA have a different

4562
03:15:27,359 --> 03:15:32,318
microbial Colony so you're GNA get a

4563
03:15:29,680 --> 03:15:33,880
different type of cure so I loved it

4564
03:15:32,318 --> 03:15:37,439
what you said wait I think people should

4565
03:15:33,879 --> 03:15:39,759
just hold off let let mother nature take

4566
03:15:37,439 --> 03:15:43,279
care of it especially those who are you

4567
03:15:39,760 --> 03:15:46,079
know working with um deep soil and

4568
03:15:43,279 --> 03:15:48,920
microbiology and have a lot of you know

4569
03:15:46,079 --> 03:15:51,159
regenerative practices around them I

4570
03:15:48,920 --> 03:15:54,439
think their flow is absolutely going to

4571
03:15:51,159 --> 03:15:56,039
be uh just fine and also I you know and

4572
03:15:54,439 --> 03:15:57,840
anybody who's listening out there just

4573
03:15:56,040 --> 03:16:00,600
because we're talking about the smoke

4574
03:15:57,840 --> 03:16:04,318
and the ash damage of course there's

4575
03:16:00,600 --> 03:16:07,000
going to be amazing beautiful small farm

4576
03:16:04,318 --> 03:16:08,278
flower coming out of this year please

4577
03:16:07,000 --> 03:16:10,120
you know just because you're hearing

4578
03:16:08,279 --> 03:16:12,960
about this doesn't mean don't go out and

4579
03:16:10,120 --> 03:16:15,279
try it I mean I've already seen some

4580
03:16:12,959 --> 03:16:17,799
flower that was even just recently cut

4581
03:16:15,279 --> 03:16:19,840
it's beautiful it it it's smells amazing

4582
03:16:17,799 --> 03:16:22,198
people are are having a lot of successes

4583
03:16:19,840 --> 03:16:22,199
now

4584
03:16:22,318 --> 03:16:29,519
so well if the if the if the ash washes

4585
03:16:26,559 --> 03:16:31,519
off into the into the hash water the

4586
03:16:29,520 --> 03:16:34,359
theoretically again to go back to this

4587
03:16:31,520 --> 03:16:36,720
theory of lie theoretically the pH of

4588
03:16:34,359 --> 03:16:39,040
the water should increase because now

4589
03:16:36,719 --> 03:16:41,358
you're dissolving all those minerals

4590
03:16:39,040 --> 03:16:43,040
which are bases and they basically make

4591
03:16:41,359 --> 03:16:47,040
an increase in PH so would be

4592
03:16:43,040 --> 03:16:49,120
interesting to see is in your Washings

4593
03:16:47,040 --> 03:16:52,960
of Ash

4594
03:16:49,120 --> 03:16:55,279
hash do you actually see a higher pH of

4595
03:16:52,959 --> 03:16:58,198
the water I'll grab the pH pen and let

4596
03:16:55,279 --> 03:17:00,960
you know do it and I think that would be

4597
03:16:58,199 --> 03:17:04,040
good water to sink into a compost pile

4598
03:17:00,959 --> 03:17:08,959
or into that aisles of your garden to

4599
03:17:04,040 --> 03:17:10,560
kind of sink that ashash water tell wuce

4600
03:17:08,959 --> 03:17:12,278
if he works with anybody on the legal

4601
03:17:10,559 --> 03:17:14,039
spot to do the same thing and that's

4602
03:17:12,279 --> 03:17:16,479
kind of what I was getting at with the

4603
03:17:14,040 --> 03:17:19,199
ash thing is where is that concentration

4604
03:17:16,478 --> 03:17:22,358
point you're really going to see that I

4605
03:17:19,199 --> 03:17:25,000
mean how much has say a 32 gallon wash

4606
03:17:22,359 --> 03:17:26,760
with 4,000 grams of material in there

4607
03:17:25,000 --> 03:17:29,439
what concentration of that needs to be

4608
03:17:26,760 --> 03:17:33,120
ashed to actually change the pH of the

4609
03:17:29,439 --> 03:17:34,920
water uh not much actually not much I

4610
03:17:33,120 --> 03:17:37,760
mean I think what what you would see is

4611
03:17:34,920 --> 03:17:40,040
you you'd see a a change so if you're

4612
03:17:37,760 --> 03:17:42,840
washing like I don't know how much are

4613
03:17:40,040 --> 03:17:46,080
you washing at a time like five or 10

4614
03:17:42,840 --> 03:17:48,398
pounds about 4,000 wet grams of can so

4615
03:17:46,079 --> 03:17:50,199
call it two pounds pound yeah two two

4616
03:17:48,398 --> 03:17:52,478
pounds yeah you should see a little bit

4617
03:17:50,199 --> 03:17:56,840
of change in the pH especially if it's

4618
03:17:52,478 --> 03:17:59,198
got a lot of Ash in there you know yeah

4619
03:17:56,840 --> 03:18:01,880
you think it's that much two pounds from

4620
03:17:59,199 --> 03:18:03,319
just four four yeah I guess I guess yeah

4621
03:18:01,879 --> 03:18:05,879
about two pounds

4622
03:18:03,318 --> 03:18:10,398
sorry the

4623
03:18:05,879 --> 03:18:14,318
2,225 gram conversion which I've heard

4624
03:18:10,398 --> 03:18:17,079
somebody say that the BCC uses 2450 but

4625
03:18:14,318 --> 03:18:19,600
then Flynn WSU laughed he's like the BC

4626
03:18:17,079 --> 03:18:21,799
doesn't have any any parameter on what's

4627
03:18:19,600 --> 03:18:23,880
fresh frozen because you pay by wet

4628
03:18:21,799 --> 03:18:27,920
weight so they don't want to

4629
03:18:23,879 --> 03:18:29,719
do the far that's just California 2225

4630
03:18:27,920 --> 03:18:32,879
that's what they've used forever how

4631
03:18:29,719 --> 03:18:35,039
accurate is that I really don't know uh

4632
03:18:32,879 --> 03:18:37,358
we just did a huge Harvest at a friend's

4633
03:18:35,040 --> 03:18:41,199
farm and one of his guys pulled some of

4634
03:18:37,359 --> 03:18:43,479
the bags and dried it and according to

4635
03:18:41,199 --> 03:18:48,120
his numbers it's 2000 is far less than a

4636
03:18:43,478 --> 03:18:51,760
pound so I Me game Farmers too of the

4637
03:18:48,120 --> 03:18:53,520
like you know you you you equate 2225

4638
03:18:51,760 --> 03:18:55,920
wet grams to a pound but that's

4639
03:18:53,520 --> 03:18:58,000
untrimmed and that's actually not equal

4640
03:18:55,920 --> 03:19:00,359
so it's more like twoth thirds of a

4641
03:18:58,000 --> 03:19:02,159
pound so in their head it's hard for

4642
03:19:00,359 --> 03:19:05,279
them to wrap around freezing weed you

4643
03:19:02,159 --> 03:19:06,559
know you know yeah the water weight

4644
03:19:05,279 --> 03:19:09,680
accounting for that it would be

4645
03:19:06,559 --> 03:19:13,238
interesting to see again is is there a

4646
03:19:09,680 --> 03:19:16,079
change in PH and do the natural

4647
03:19:13,238 --> 03:19:18,879
components of what's else is in the hash

4648
03:19:16,079 --> 03:19:21,639
water somehow how buffer that change in

4649
03:19:18,879 --> 03:19:23,599
PH so no matter how much Ash is in there

4650
03:19:21,639 --> 03:19:25,920
you won't really sing a SW see a swing

4651
03:19:23,600 --> 03:19:28,439
of pH well one of the experiments you

4652
03:19:25,920 --> 03:19:31,079
could run is you can take your water

4653
03:19:28,439 --> 03:19:33,079
after you've done your hashing and add

4654
03:19:31,079 --> 03:19:34,199
Ash to it and see if you could change

4655
03:19:33,079 --> 03:19:37,159
the

4656
03:19:34,199 --> 03:19:39,439
pH see see if the see if the natural

4657
03:19:37,159 --> 03:19:42,478
components of what you're extracting out

4658
03:19:39,439 --> 03:19:45,359
of the plant is capable of basically

4659
03:19:42,478 --> 03:19:48,079
masking the increase in PH that you

4660
03:19:45,359 --> 03:19:49,760
would see if there was Ash in there and

4661
03:19:48,079 --> 03:19:52,398
again the way you do that is you spike

4662
03:19:49,760 --> 03:19:54,478
it with Ash to see if you actually see

4663
03:19:52,398 --> 03:19:57,119
you know the increase in PH I'm just

4664
03:19:54,478 --> 03:19:59,920
going to you know take a wild guess here

4665
03:19:57,120 --> 03:20:03,120
but with the amount of Ash I'm seeing on

4666
03:19:59,920 --> 03:20:06,159
that size run I would expect maybe you

4667
03:20:03,120 --> 03:20:08,040
know like a gram or two of it to be Ash

4668
03:20:06,159 --> 03:20:10,799
you know out of the entire weight of the

4669
03:20:08,040 --> 03:20:12,800
whole thing yeah and and that so if you

4670
03:20:10,799 --> 03:20:15,358
just think about the stochiometry of how

4671
03:20:12,799 --> 03:20:17,478
much how much you need you would need to

4672
03:20:15,359 --> 03:20:19,359
add to swing the pH a little bit you're

4673
03:20:17,478 --> 03:20:20,358
going to see a difference in PH right

4674
03:20:19,359 --> 03:20:22,880
I'm G to check it out I can almost

4675
03:20:20,359 --> 03:20:25,640
guarantee it y cool you can report it

4676
03:20:22,879 --> 03:20:28,159
back here on hash

4677
03:20:25,639 --> 03:20:30,198
church I'm all about figuring those

4678
03:20:28,159 --> 03:20:31,920
things out because I get I get I can't

4679
03:20:30,199 --> 03:20:34,079
tell you how many times people ask me

4680
03:20:31,920 --> 03:20:35,799
all these crazy questions of what can be

4681
03:20:34,079 --> 03:20:39,439
washed what can't be washed what should

4682
03:20:35,799 --> 03:20:40,879
I bother with and you know we've I I

4683
03:20:39,439 --> 03:20:43,840
will sit here and admit that we've

4684
03:20:40,879 --> 03:20:45,959
washed some pretty crazy stuff so that

4685
03:20:43,840 --> 03:20:48,880
we could run it through testing or see

4686
03:20:45,959 --> 03:20:50,959
just see for ourselves exactly what

4687
03:20:48,879 --> 03:20:53,478
happens in the end if people only

4688
03:20:50,959 --> 03:20:56,599
realize their questions are literally so

4689
03:20:53,478 --> 03:20:58,398
they don't have to see what happens they

4690
03:20:56,600 --> 03:20:59,960
like it's it's such an insane thing it's

4691
03:20:58,398 --> 03:21:02,000
like oh I'm just gonna I don't want to

4692
03:20:59,959 --> 03:21:04,159
make any mistakes because mistakes lead

4693
03:21:02,000 --> 03:21:06,520
to Innovation and yeah we can't have

4694
03:21:04,159 --> 03:21:08,039
that like I need to just ask everyone

4695
03:21:06,520 --> 03:21:09,279
what oh hey just can tell me all your

4696
03:21:08,040 --> 03:21:11,479
mistakes that you made so I don't make

4697
03:21:09,279 --> 03:21:12,960
those same go out and make those very

4698
03:21:11,478 --> 03:21:14,559
same mistakes and make a bunch of new

4699
03:21:12,959 --> 03:21:16,919
ones and come back and tell us all about

4700
03:21:14,559 --> 03:21:19,478
the Innovation it led to don't ask me

4701
03:21:16,920 --> 03:21:21,879
questions that keep you from that

4702
03:21:19,478 --> 03:21:24,119
journey I get a lot of those questions

4703
03:21:21,879 --> 03:21:25,719
man I'm just like okay how do I answer I

4704
03:21:24,120 --> 03:21:27,520
feel like that's one thing I've always

4705
03:21:25,719 --> 03:21:29,238
I've always no matter what anybody tells

4706
03:21:27,520 --> 03:21:32,238
me I have to find out for my own so I

4707
03:21:29,238 --> 03:21:34,600
just stopped years ago and throw it

4708
03:21:32,238 --> 03:21:37,000
through and see what we get you

4709
03:21:34,600 --> 03:21:38,640
know yeah if you're not making mistakes

4710
03:21:37,000 --> 03:21:40,040
in your garden or figuring things out

4711
03:21:38,639 --> 03:21:42,398
and dealing with different issues you're

4712
03:21:40,040 --> 03:21:44,160
never going to learn it's one thing I've

4713
03:21:42,398 --> 03:21:46,719
always pushed my plants through their

4714
03:21:44,159 --> 03:21:48,318
limits and I leave plants in one gallon

4715
03:21:46,719 --> 03:21:50,000
pots for six months just to see what I

4716
03:21:48,318 --> 03:21:53,519
can do to them just so I can learn from

4717
03:21:50,000 --> 03:21:55,040
it so you can understand it like you

4718
03:21:53,520 --> 03:21:56,920
haven't botched a run you haven't done

4719
03:21:55,040 --> 03:21:59,880
it right

4720
03:21:56,920 --> 03:22:02,318
right I mean I've had everything every

4721
03:21:59,879 --> 03:22:05,079
problem known to a gardener I

4722
03:22:02,318 --> 03:22:07,079
think scales anybody's ever had scales

4723
03:22:05,079 --> 03:22:08,520
and sure I sure enough got them but

4724
03:22:07,079 --> 03:22:11,039
learning how to deal with all those

4725
03:22:08,520 --> 03:22:12,840
problems a great way and and that's all

4726
03:22:11,040 --> 03:22:14,760
it's ever been it's just research and

4727
03:22:12,840 --> 03:22:17,120
understanding and seeing what works and

4728
03:22:14,760 --> 03:22:20,800
everybody's still fighting powder how do

4729
03:22:17,120 --> 03:22:20,800
I deal with it how do I deal with

4730
03:22:20,920 --> 03:22:26,040
it it's hard to yeah you learn a whole

4731
03:22:24,079 --> 03:22:27,879
lot more from an experiment that doesn't

4732
03:22:26,040 --> 03:22:30,920
work than from an experiment that does

4733
03:22:27,879 --> 03:22:33,039
work if you do an experiment that works

4734
03:22:30,920 --> 03:22:35,040
why' you do the experiment to begin with

4735
03:22:33,040 --> 03:22:36,800
right wasn't much of an experiment if

4736
03:22:35,040 --> 03:22:38,560
you knew if it was going to work

4737
03:22:36,799 --> 03:22:40,358
research is what you do when you don't

4738
03:22:38,559 --> 03:22:44,559
know what you're

4739
03:22:40,359 --> 03:22:46,318
doing yeah you know he's just try [ __ ]

4740
03:22:44,559 --> 03:22:48,639
that is the truth I like the way you put

4741
03:22:46,318 --> 03:22:50,879
that listen we got seven more minutes

4742
03:22:48,639 --> 03:22:52,519
for today's episode it's been great

4743
03:22:50,879 --> 03:22:54,159
having everyone on here I just wanted to

4744
03:22:52,520 --> 03:22:56,079
let everyone know I'm going to go and

4745
03:22:54,159 --> 03:22:57,959
spend the rest of the day with my little

4746
03:22:56,079 --> 03:23:00,879
son who's anxiously awaiting on the

4747
03:22:57,959 --> 03:23:03,318
other side of the door there and so yeah

4748
03:23:00,879 --> 03:23:04,759
let's uh finish it off seven minutes

4749
03:23:03,318 --> 03:23:08,398
left if you guys want to say anything

4750
03:23:04,760 --> 03:23:10,279
about Horatio feel free to now this

4751
03:23:08,398 --> 03:23:12,398
might be a good time to mention a little

4752
03:23:10,279 --> 03:23:14,960
something something because this is the

4753
03:23:12,398 --> 03:23:17,358
end of the episode go ahead anyone you

4754
03:23:14,959 --> 03:23:21,278
know Mark hero is the reason why I

4755
03:23:17,359 --> 03:23:23,520
became on the panel at hashir so you

4756
03:23:21,279 --> 03:23:26,560
know you guys wouldn't know who I am and

4757
03:23:23,520 --> 03:23:31,560
I wouldn't know any of you people and so

4758
03:23:26,559 --> 03:23:34,959
I have to be grateful for his friendship

4759
03:23:31,559 --> 03:23:36,719
and for you know he reached out to me I

4760
03:23:34,959 --> 03:23:40,238
never reached out to him he reached out

4761
03:23:36,719 --> 03:23:42,519
to me and and then I was I think he was

4762
03:23:40,238 --> 03:23:44,719
like on his phone with me a couple times

4763
03:23:42,520 --> 03:23:46,640
while he was on hash church and he'd

4764
03:23:44,719 --> 03:23:49,119
like ask me a question and then he go

4765
03:23:46,639 --> 03:23:50,920
back to Hash so he's and then it just

4766
03:23:49,120 --> 03:23:53,600
became natural hey Mark why don't you

4767
03:23:50,920 --> 03:23:57,960
come on and so I think Mark did he

4768
03:23:53,600 --> 03:24:00,760
introduce me to you right did 100% yep

4769
03:23:57,959 --> 03:24:03,799
so I have to be grateful for how hash

4770
03:24:00,760 --> 03:24:06,318
church has enriched my life with all of

4771
03:24:03,799 --> 03:24:08,278
your friendship and you know I see the

4772
03:24:06,318 --> 03:24:10,920
comments in the chat everyone seems to

4773
03:24:08,279 --> 03:24:13,399
like when I pipe in with knowledge and

4774
03:24:10,920 --> 03:24:15,799
it's just my pleasure of my life to be

4775
03:24:13,398 --> 03:24:18,119
here to share that knowledge with yall

4776
03:24:15,799 --> 03:24:20,959
and to be everyone's friend on this

4777
03:24:18,120 --> 03:24:23,079
panel uh you guys mean a lot to me uh

4778
03:24:20,959 --> 03:24:25,519
kind of like my internet family so I

4779
03:24:23,079 --> 03:24:28,920
really I have to be grateful for Horatio

4780
03:24:25,520 --> 03:24:31,800
for introducing me to you Marcus and for

4781
03:24:28,920 --> 03:24:34,000
your continued you know friendship and

4782
03:24:31,799 --> 03:24:36,920
Johnny's continued friendship and Sam

4783
03:24:34,000 --> 03:24:39,279
and everybody and so I think what we

4784
03:24:36,920 --> 03:24:40,920
find in life is it's not like what you

4785
03:24:39,279 --> 03:24:43,600
know and it's not necessarily who you

4786
03:24:40,920 --> 03:24:46,040
know but it's like who you get to know

4787
03:24:43,600 --> 03:24:49,238
and who you bring into your circle and

4788
03:24:46,040 --> 03:24:51,479
your um the influence that you have

4789
03:24:49,238 --> 03:24:53,879
amongst your friends and the collective

4790
03:24:51,478 --> 03:24:56,198
knowledge that you're able to share uh

4791
03:24:53,879 --> 03:24:59,438
you know the old saying a rising Tide

4792

03:28:47,199 --> 03:28:50,079
I was uh really looking forward to uh

4864
03:28:48,840 --> 03:28:51,120
seeing more of his research and I know

4865
03:28:50,079 --> 03:28:53,039
some people out there know a lot about

4866
03:28:51,120 --> 03:28:54,439
Mark and some other people and I've seen

4867
03:28:53,040 --> 03:28:55,960
and worked with ratio quite a bit so

4868
03:28:54,439 --> 03:28:57,079
there's some stuff that uh all the

4869
03:28:55,959 --> 03:28:58,318
barrels are leaning there and just

4870
03:28:57,079 --> 03:29:00,680
different things of what he was doing at

4871
03:28:58,318 --> 03:29:03,000
the end uh he took a break and really

4872
03:29:00,680 --> 03:29:04,639
focused on jewelry and uh wait till you

4873
03:29:03,000 --> 03:29:06,439
see the jewry line come out guys his

4874
03:29:04,639 --> 03:29:09,079
whole bement was full of all jewelie

4875
03:29:06,439 --> 03:29:11,359
making equipment and he he did some text

4876
03:29:09,079 --> 03:29:13,760
that of course Heria would do that no

4877
03:29:11,359 --> 03:29:15,520
one else was done and to look forward

4878
03:29:13,760 --> 03:29:17,159
for Mar to releasing that so it'll be a

4879
03:29:15,520 --> 03:29:18,800
type of Jew Lise and stuff like that

4880
03:29:17,159 --> 03:29:21,159
that they actually put together at the

4881
03:29:18,799 --> 03:29:22,358
end of the last year and that's why her

4882
03:29:21,159 --> 03:29:24,920
should stopped talking with everybody

4883
03:29:22,359 --> 03:29:27,199
because he went deep into uh his passion

4884
03:29:24,920 --> 03:29:30,719
was into doing his art and doing all

4885
03:29:27,199 --> 03:29:32,439
these molds and uh so um you'll see some

4886

guys thanks Johnny B for the touching

4909
03:30:21,398 --> 03:30:27,318
words I know that the family appreciates

4910
03:30:24,120 --> 03:30:30,000
that for sure as do we did anyone else

4911
03:30:27,318 --> 03:30:32,478
want to mention any words before we shut

4912
03:30:30,000 --> 03:30:35,040
her down and send a rest in peace to

4913
03:30:32,478 --> 03:30:36,959
Horatio H I didn't know the guy

4914
03:30:35,040 --> 03:30:39,040
personally but obviously been following

4915
03:30:36,959 --> 03:30:41,398
him since day one on hash church but one

4916
03:30:39,040 --> 03:30:43,880
thing I just want to share what what I

4917
03:30:41,398 --> 03:30:45,680
thought was cool about Horatio not as

4918
03:30:43,879 --> 03:30:47,799
somebody who didn't know him is you

4919
03:30:45,680 --> 03:30:52,680
could tell that that guy anything he got

4920
03:30:47,799 --> 03:30:54,759
into he fully geeked out on went way for

4921
03:30:52,680 --> 03:30:57,840
the fence swung way for the fences all

4922
03:30:54,760 --> 03:30:59,079
the way out there every detail like that

4923
03:30:57,840 --> 03:31:00,279
and that to me that's cool because

4924
03:30:59,079 --> 03:31:02,760
that's kind of the way I am when I get

4925
03:31:00,279 --> 03:31:06,600
into something it's it's just full geek

4926
03:31:02,760 --> 03:31:09,079
mode so I can inspires me a little bit

4927
03:31:06,600 --> 03:31:10,840
no that's that's absolutely true you

4928
03:31:09,079 --> 03:31:13,279
know and it teaches all of us that you

4929
03:31:10,840 --> 03:31:15,359
know you don't you don't you don't let

4930
03:31:13,279 --> 03:31:18,120
your own limit you don't limit yourself

4931
03:31:15,359 --> 03:31:22,640
on your own limitations you set stretch

4932
03:31:18,120 --> 03:31:27,319
goals and he you're that

4933
03:31:22,639 --> 03:31:29,760
you now on the head he was he knew a lot

4934
03:31:27,318 --> 03:31:31,398
more than he actually really understood

4935
03:31:29,760 --> 03:31:34,079
if you know what I mean I mean he he

4936
03:31:31,398 --> 03:31:35,840
just he knew things instinctively in the

4937
03:31:34,079 --> 03:31:38,039
lab and when he would call me and we

4938
03:31:35,840 --> 03:31:40,680
would talk he would say things that I'm

4939
03:31:38,040 --> 03:31:42,359
like oh yeah there's a reason why that

4940
03:31:40,680 --> 03:31:45,040
happens and you know I kind of explain

4941
03:31:42,359 --> 03:31:47,399
it to him but I think it teaches us all

4942
03:31:45,040 --> 03:31:50,600
the lesson that you you know we should

4943
03:31:47,398 --> 03:31:53,198
achieve set our goals high and even if

4944
03:31:50,600 --> 03:31:55,600
we don't hit that goal even if we fall

4945
03:31:53,199 --> 03:31:57,760
just short of that goal we'll go a lot

4946
03:31:55,600 --> 03:32:01,040
farther than we probably would have if

4947
03:31:57,760 --> 03:32:05,559
we never set that goal to begin with so

4948
03:32:01,040 --> 03:32:05,560
I think it's a good model to live your

4949
03:32:05,719 --> 03:32:11,039
life totally and to have the heart of

4950
03:32:08,559 --> 03:32:13,439
faith and to have the heart space while

4951
03:32:11,040 --> 03:32:16,840
you do it so you know a person like ctia
