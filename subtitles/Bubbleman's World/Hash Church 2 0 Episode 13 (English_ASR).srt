46
00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:42,920
of fun we had the mayor Berkeley show up

47
00:02:39,979 --> 00:02:44,840
and you can see my pictures I was

48
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:48,169
dressed up in my scooby-doo outfit and

49
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:50,530
right I saw that cause if you're gonna

50
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:53,719
meet the mayor being a scooby-doo outfit

51
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:55,729
yeah no I agree I think Chris would also

52
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:57,680
agree if you're gonna meet the mayor you

53
00:02:55,729 --> 00:03:02,899
should be in a scooby-doo outfit don't

54
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:06,769
you think Chris yeah way to meet your

55
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:09,200
constituency you know my protege is

56
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:12,650
gonna be that Rob Ford guy from [ __ ]

57
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:17,209
Toronto because nothing more honest than

58
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:18,889
Rob Ford I'll tell you that's that is

59
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:21,079
the truth I'm just trying to think now

60
00:03:18,889 --> 00:03:23,030
if that's the original one or if that's

61
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:27,919
the brother I always keep I always mix

62
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:30,530
them up Rob Rob passed away right yeah

63
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:33,760
yeah yeah yes so now his brother is like

64
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:37,848
in politics and got chosen as a position

65
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:41,030
and he's he's also a ridiculous version

66
00:03:37,848 --> 00:03:43,039
of his brother of just not your average

67
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:48,318
politician that's for sure

68
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:50,750
oh well yeah he did pass away Stephen

69
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:52,578
Simon's has confirmed can't keep up with

70
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:54,348
this stuff how's everyone doing this

71
00:03:52,579 --> 00:03:57,739
morning we got skunk man Sam we got

72
00:03:54,348 --> 00:04:01,578
Chris brownie we got a tampon tag in the

73
00:03:57,739 --> 00:04:04,849
room and me bubble man as well as 452

74
00:04:01,579 --> 00:04:07,879
viewers wow that's a good amount of

75
00:04:04,848 --> 00:04:10,268
paper for 904 before we start with

76
00:04:07,878 --> 00:04:13,518
everybody I have a question for Chris

77
00:04:10,269 --> 00:04:19,519
what do you like better pure THC

78
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:21,949
distillate or dirty c or knock your

79
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:25,519
teeth dry sip that strychnine rich

80
00:04:21,949 --> 00:04:27,439
laughter if you'd only be what 80 85

81
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:30,490
percent THC but

82
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:33,920
pretty damn good oh yeah I would say

83
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:36,350
like right now my go-to are the like THC

84
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:38,900
products with like basically like as

85
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:42,070
little Terps as possible if not if like

86
00:04:38,899 --> 00:04:44,329
any Terps I like pretty much just I

87
00:04:42,069 --> 00:04:48,469
don't go lately I've been on kind of

88
00:04:44,329 --> 00:04:50,899
like a hotter hotter dad more THC trip

89
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:52,880
but you know my friends keep me turfed

90
00:04:50,899 --> 00:04:54,829
up but I say like that's sort of my

91
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:56,959
go-to keeps me like more stimulated and

92
00:04:54,829 --> 00:05:01,430
less stony it's kind of my experience

93
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:04,279
with it interesting as times gone by my

94
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:06,500
I look it's really appreciate the herbs

95
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:08,000
I feel like physiologically they're a

96
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:13,629
little bit more harsher than just the

97
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:17,029
THC products for the higher THC products

98
00:05:13,629 --> 00:05:19,279
because I know when I smoke dry sip

99
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:24,619
which are still extremely high

100
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:28,689
intervenes but also I mean last time I

101
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:32,660
measured it was 83 percent THC a so

102
00:05:28,689 --> 00:05:37,990
respectable teens rest I guess is

103
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:40,550
probably planted cells if you wax

104
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:41,810
yeah we've had a kind of a change as

105
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:44,360
well here in California because

106
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:45,050
everybody knew market again as its

107
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,980
reemerged

108
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:51,050
in the legal world and everything that's

109
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:53,360
coming out right now is all sauces we

110
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:55,370
can't define shatter or anything else is

111
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,620
near next to impossible and kind of

112
00:05:55,370 --> 00:06:01,040
frustrating and I feel you exactly there

113
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:03,199
Chris I feel the I feel the harshness of

114
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:05,270
the Terps so much because my makes I'm

115
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:09,050
used to a little more waxy or mix and

116
00:06:05,269 --> 00:06:10,969
for me it seems to be more THC I don't

117
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:12,740
seem to get as high with my mix with as

118
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:15,470
much with all these you know these

119
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:17,418
terpene sauces and I know that'll change

120
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:19,490
in time it's just as the market is

121
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:21,889
getting up and getting itself

122
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:27,350
established still it's just the reality

123
00:06:21,889 --> 00:06:29,689
that we face yeah I have honestly I

124
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:31,430
forget to actually yet to be you go into

125
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:34,519
a store in California yet to buy

126
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:37,220
anything I can't I can't tell you

127
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:38,478
personally about the the atmosphere but

128
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:40,580
from what I hear that's pretty much

129
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:45,389
consistent

130
00:06:40,579 --> 00:06:47,310
yeah the reality interesting though that

131
00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:49,289
you'd you know it's true that the Terps

132
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:51,389
definitely create sort of a more stony

133
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:53,490
version so if you're if you're kind of

134
00:06:51,389 --> 00:06:55,139
like sitting around and watching movies

135
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:57,150
or you don't have to do too much you can

136
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:59,669
really enjoy those turps but if you

137
00:06:57,149 --> 00:07:01,319
might you know potentially be doing some

138
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:06,300
chemistry or maybe need a little bit

139
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:09,870
more focus maybe less turps is going to

140
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:12,949
I agree Marcus I find that third piece

141
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:17,310
the right one sirs-e one that can

142
00:07:12,949 --> 00:07:18,990
potentiate ghz makes it stronger and it

143
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:25,530
definitely is like a steering wheel

144
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:28,500
where it modulates mm-hmm absolutely

145
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:31,109
welcome chimera in the room I see that

146
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:40,889
big large bud I think that's chimera

147
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:43,860
behind that bud temperature yeah he

148
00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:44,870
sounds like he's in a tube like a mile

149
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:51,090
away

150
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:53,550
Waldo you all we got 537 people I have

151
00:07:51,089 --> 00:07:56,069
invited a few others I think we're gonna

152
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:58,740
see Wade laughter in here I'm not sure a

153
00:07:56,069 --> 00:08:01,620
forest is gonna make it dr. mark said he

154
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:03,150
was gonna make it I did invite Indra he

155
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:06,389
said he was probably gonna hang out just

156
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:08,549
in chat but if he feels the conversation

157
00:08:06,389 --> 00:08:11,129
is on point he might come in had a

158
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:14,129
really good conversation with with

159
00:08:11,129 --> 00:08:16,079
injury yesterday especially hadn't

160
00:08:14,129 --> 00:08:18,750
hadn't spoken with him for a long time I

161
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:21,300
have to find say I really do quite enjoy

162
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:25,199
one-on-one conversations with Indra he's

163
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:27,210
just I that's my favorite Indra the the

185
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:48,539

186
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:50,509
so funny yesterday I had a quick little

187
00:09:48,539 --> 00:09:52,319
google chat with Chris and Mark and

188
00:09:50,509 --> 00:09:57,120
Chris and I are trying to have a

189
00:09:52,320 --> 00:10:00,300
conversation Mark's just like just

190
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:04,080
ripping hard dabs maybe he was ripping

191
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:06,179
hot dabs actually who prefers a hot dab

192
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,759
over a cool dab I heard Chris say it

193
00:10:06,179 --> 00:10:10,979
earlier today there's no doubt about

194
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:14,278
that hot dab rocks you in a way that

195
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:20,909
that low temp dab just pant punchy but

196
00:10:14,278 --> 00:10:23,100
it definitely doesn't have taste you do

197
00:10:20,909 --> 00:10:25,049
but I'm telling you like that overly hot

198
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:27,509
damn I took one not too long ago I can't

199
00:10:25,049 --> 00:10:31,620
remember where I was but it ended up

200
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:33,509
being hot and I was just coughing for

201
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:36,060
about five plus minutes and afterwards

202
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:37,919
there was legitimately I was completely

203
00:10:36,059 --> 00:10:41,549
destroyed for like the next 15-20

204
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:42,088
minutes what I thought yeah exactly what

205
00:10:41,549 --> 00:10:45,179
temperature

206
00:10:42,089 --> 00:10:47,040
Wow hot is hot this was all this you

207
00:10:45,179 --> 00:10:48,539
know where it was it was out of glass

208
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:51,539
the glass blowing

209
00:10:48,539 --> 00:10:53,219
it wasn't stratospheric glasses I don't

210
00:10:51,539 --> 00:10:54,429
know if you guys know stratosphere he's

211
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,800
doing

212
00:10:54,429 --> 00:10:58,829
it was real nice now Sam's doing it

213
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:01,299
that's awesome

214
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:05,560
yeah the spinning stuff right so I was

215
00:11:01,299 --> 00:11:13,179
doing sorry now your mic is as on as on

216
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:14,919
gets my brother anyway these guys were

217
00:11:13,179 --> 00:11:16,659
heating the [ __ ] up with like an

218
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:18,759
acetylene torch or whatever you know

219
00:11:16,659 --> 00:11:19,990
like a welding torch not like or or

220
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:22,000
maybe it was even their their

221
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:24,339
glassblowing torch I can't remember but

222
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,330
I remember taking the dab and it being

223
00:11:24,339 --> 00:11:31,089
so hot also coil coil condenser was

224
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:32,980
there as well and I can't remember who

225
00:11:31,089 --> 00:11:34,810
else was there but man I was like for

226
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:37,330
about 15 20 minutes I went sat out in

227
00:11:34,809 --> 00:11:41,439
the garden and just was like holy smokes

228
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:43,570
like I am absolutely flying right now

229
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,170
it's straight to the forehead when you

230
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:47,860
take a hottie

231
00:11:44,169 --> 00:11:49,870
I mean you've toss up between the oxygen

232
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:52,990
deprivation from coughing so much and

233
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:55,149
then the addition of an exertion of hard

234
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:58,120
THC into the bloodstream your brain

235
00:11:55,149 --> 00:12:01,000
categorize don't stand up real fast yeah

236
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:02,919
it's completely insane it was I think

237
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,620
that bad that the oxygen thing has a lot

238
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:07,629
to do with it cuz I find every time I

239
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:11,080
cough after about a five minute mark

240
00:12:07,629 --> 00:12:14,289
every single cough I get like a hundred

241
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:18,720
feet higher every cough it's just like

242
00:12:14,289 --> 00:12:26,230
this exponential experience of effect

243
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:36,190
yeah where we see it a lot was imagine

244
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:38,159
that we used to have wow I saw that the

245
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:41,500
cannabis cup is happening in Amsterdam

246
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:50,079
well they had one last year too

247
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:51,879
sometimes I start again gen dope it put

248
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:55,330
a picture up that she was there and I

249
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:59,679
was like wow I got married there back in

250
00:12:55,330 --> 00:13:06,280

251
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:07,599

252
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:12,179
was definitely

253
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,180
there whatever year was I was definitely

254
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:22,239
Gaskin did the ceremony and the glass

255
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:23,979
might was the on stage and the wedding

256
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:27,639

257
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:29,800
trichomes that what he call its mom made

258
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:32,649
the cake and it was oh my god

259
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:34,599
destroyed everybody Jack Herer everybody

260
00:13:32,649 --> 00:13:40,149
were all just wasted by this cake it was

261
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:44,259
amazing yes the infamous wedding cake I

262
00:13:40,149 --> 00:13:46,509
had a memory from about four or five or

263
00:13:44,259 --> 00:13:48,490
six years ago come up today and it's too

264
00:13:46,509 --> 00:13:51,370
bad that I can't find it now because it

265
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:53,079
was it was me and Rob Clark and we were

266
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:55,179
walking to the back apartments of the

267
00:13:53,078 --> 00:13:56,948
krasnopolskiy hotel where I always

268
00:13:55,179 --> 00:13:58,359
stayed I never stayed at the front I

269
00:13:56,948 --> 00:14:01,778
walked through the back it looks

270
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:04,600
beautiful Chris and Rob and I came

271
00:14:01,778 --> 00:14:06,549
across a giant mountain of ice that the

272
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,139
hotel had dumped out so there it's a

273
00:14:06,549 --> 00:14:09,669
funny picture of Rob and I I don't know

274
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:12,039
who took it there must have been someone

275
00:14:09,669 --> 00:14:14,490
else with us but we're basically holding

276
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:18,509
up the ice and making this crazy sort of

277
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:20,740
crazy sort of look but it was good

278
00:14:18,509 --> 00:14:22,329
what's wrong with my mic you want me to

279
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:24,310
turn it down a bit I can do that

280
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:26,948
I can turn my mic down a bit if that

281
00:14:24,309 --> 00:14:30,188
works where would you be without ice how

282
00:14:26,948 --> 00:14:31,990
do I see the group comments like a group

283
00:14:30,188 --> 00:14:34,719
chat with the members of the group is

284
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:37,509
there a way to see the what anyone else

285
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:40,740
if anyone else is saying anything you

286
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:44,289
need to open up the YouTube separate

287
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:47,889
window and then go to this exact channel

288
00:14:44,289 --> 00:14:50,379
to this exact post and on the right

289
00:14:47,889 --> 00:14:53,889
you'll have the chat and make sure it's

290
00:14:50,379 --> 00:14:56,259
muted oh yeah I mean that that goes

291
00:14:53,889 --> 00:14:58,720

just saying there's some absolute fire

297
00:15:16,419 --> 00:15:20,620
that's been added this year I saw some

298
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:21,100
of the molecular farm sentries at man

299
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:24,730

302
00:15:27,309 --> 00:15:31,659
pen I'm not sure exactly what I'm

303
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:37,840
judging at the moment but I'll find out

304

see you there you know what maybe I

309
00:15:50,769 --> 00:15:58,000

310
00:15:53,470 --> 00:16:02,769
won't let me out of America I'm less

311
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:05,350
worried about don't get me wrong but

312
00:16:02,769 --> 00:16:08,559
some listen American folks are some of

313
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:13,600
my best friends they're much more acres

314
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:15,399
in there you go that's actually a good

315
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,259
point I'll have my lawyer bring that up

316
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:20,889
if I ever get detained at the border and

317
00:16:17,259 --> 00:16:23,740
and kept kept in the country yeah the

318
00:16:20,889 --> 00:16:27,100
big thing is we get rid of you as fast

319
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:28,269
as ready the big thing is social meeting

320
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,590
here right I mean you don't want to be

321
00:16:28,269 --> 00:16:31,210
saying that you're going down for an

322
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:33,280
event that involves cannabis they just

323
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:35,440

325
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:43,210
the to the the mg best card in Las Vegas

326
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:45,429
yeah that guy was just an investor yeah

327
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:52,450
well they were invested in a facility in

328
00:16:45,429 --> 00:16:54,099
Nevada they really don't like it when

329
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:56,620
foreigners are putting money into a

330
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:58,930
federally illegal space right it's one

331
00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:01,750
thing for Americans to be investing in

332
00:16:58,929 --> 00:17:03,729
their own space but you know it kind of

333
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:11,140
gives us flavor of cartels would you're

334
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:12,730
taking foreign money sorry about that I

335
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:14,230
had to mute you Indra came in pretty

336
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:16,269
loud with the background noise there

337
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:18,279
yeah so what anyway what they're saying

338
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:20,619
for people to do now I know as Terry

339
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:22,750
booth was speaking of the CEO of Aurora

340
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:24,879
was speaking at this event if I guess

341
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:27,460
stay and some of these other folks they

342
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,540
told them just go to LA and tell him

343
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:30,160
you're going to LA for something

344
00:17:28,539 --> 00:17:32,529
unrelated on business then drive over

345
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,540
you don't want to show at the border and

346
00:17:32,529 --> 00:17:37,809
say we go to this cannabis

347
00:17:34,539 --> 00:17:41,740
my problem is if you punch my name in

348
00:17:37,809 --> 00:17:44,500
for sure for sure for sure bubbleman

349
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:47,349
[ __ ] comes up like intertwine this

350
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:48,099
hashed churches and instagrams and all

351
00:17:47,349 --> 00:17:50,649
this

352
00:17:48,099 --> 00:17:52,869
I guess not really easy to get over the

353
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:54,160
border sort of stuff yeah but if you if

354
00:17:52,869 --> 00:17:56,769
you again if you have one of those

355
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:59,500
waivers and then you have a purpose that

356
00:17:56,769 --> 00:18:02,289
you're going down for this sure sure of

357
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:04,539
course I don't I do not have a waiver

358
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:06,369
the part that I don't like about the

359
00:18:04,539 --> 00:18:09,730
waiver is the part where you have to go

360
00:18:06,369 --> 00:18:13,000
to the US border to get it signed so you

361
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:15,880
have to go to the US border before you

362
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:22,690
get your waiver it's the only way to get

363
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:25,510
the waiver still you're still there like

364
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:28,720
for me it's always felt like I'm

365
00:18:25,509 --> 00:18:31,660
entering a federal penitentiary that's

366
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,670
what going across the border into the US

367
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:35,019
and for that matter for that matter it's

368
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:39,570
the same as coming up into Canada

369
00:18:35,019 --> 00:18:39,569
actually just had 290 in my own country

370
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:51,400
and hey here's a picture I found from

371
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:55,269

375
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:06,819
show during the while we were there but

376
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:08,289
yeah that's from back in 95 you know I

377
00:19:06,819 --> 00:19:13,379
was there for sure it was Hillary

378
00:19:08,289 --> 00:19:15,970
working at the posi tronics of course

379
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:19,750
right so yes she only worked there that

380
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:23,559
one year so interesting that was 95 not

381
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:25,630
yeah that was 95 for sure yeah yeah cuz

382
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:30,009

383
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:31,690
next year crazy yeah I stayed with her

384
00:19:30,009 --> 00:19:34,359
at her place it was really cool a lot of

385
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:36,549
fun I had a booth that year on the top

386
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:39,569
floor of the PAC's party house smack dab

387
00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:44,950
between Jack Herer and his daughter and

388
00:19:39,569 --> 00:19:48,009
Eagle Bill that's how I got introduced

389
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:48,559
in the cannabis cup bro Jesus Christ to

390
00:19:48,009 --> 00:19:50,210
ego

391
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:52,669
oh wow and you're just smacked in

392
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:56,090
between jeepers dude but it was it was

393
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:58,009
hilarious I mean you know Jack we didn't

394
00:19:56,089 --> 00:20:00,529
know who eagle was but we had studied

395
00:19:58,009 --> 00:20:02,059
the book of Jack let me tell you I mean

396
00:20:00,529 --> 00:20:04,579
I knew that book like the back of my

397
00:20:02,059 --> 00:20:07,429
hand we were gonna use it in the next

398
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:11,119
year to get actually we had used it that

399
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:13,039
year the year private previously 94 we

400
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:14,809
used it to convince our ministers to let

401
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:17,569
us grow hemp in the province and nine

402
00:20:14,809 --> 00:20:20,329
months later in 95 we grew our our first

403
00:20:17,569 --> 00:20:23,509
hemp field so that's pretty that's

404
00:20:20,329 --> 00:20:25,939
pretty [ __ ] crazy smack dab to be

405
00:20:23,509 --> 00:20:28,670
able to be beside the guy who literally

406
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:30,890
turned you on to being able to

407
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:33,230
acknowledge all of the information and

408
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:36,380
articulate it back to a Minister of

409
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:37,819
Finance and a Minister of Agriculture to

410
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:39,380
be able to convince them to grow

411
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:42,799
something that had not been grown in

412
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:44,420
over 73 years the more I look back at

413
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:47,240
that the more I think that was that was

414
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:48,710
some incredible [ __ ] I I don't know

415
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:50,539
would have happened if Jack hadn't have

416
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:53,299
come to my to West Virginia University

417
00:20:50,539 --> 00:20:55,789
in 1989 if I hadn't gotten a copy if

418
00:20:53,299 --> 00:20:57,559
they're aware is no close I have no idea

419
00:20:55,789 --> 00:21:00,529
what would have happened to my life but

420
00:20:57,559 --> 00:21:03,970
I'm beyond thankful it has and I did

421
00:21:00,529 --> 00:21:06,710
because it changed my entire reality

422
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:11,000
well you got yours before me we got our

423
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:13,450
first one in either 90 or 91 is when I

424
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:17,299
got turned onto that book and just like

425
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:18,890
annihilated it oh I had a girlfriend

426
00:21:17,299 --> 00:21:20,930
break up with me because I would go to a

427
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:22,700
party and all I would talk about was the

428
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:24,830
Emperor's and all these pastas well you

429
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:26,809
should know about all this pot and hemp

430
00:21:24,829 --> 00:21:29,529
stuff and you take this book with you to

431
00:21:26,809 --> 00:21:32,089
parties and your show people I'm like

432
00:21:29,529 --> 00:21:33,859
that she didn't get it just annoyed this

433
00:21:32,089 --> 00:21:35,359
charity so I was like okay look we're

434
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:37,969
it's just not getting getting getting

435
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:39,919
along here so okay I guess I chose the

436
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:42,110
Emperor wears no clothes over you know

437
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:45,590
my girlfriend at the time but dude I'm

438
00:21:42,109 --> 00:21:47,689
telling me it changed my life and that

439
00:21:45,589 --> 00:21:48,799
was the first of a long list of women

440
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:53,580
that went by the way

441
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:53,579
[Laughter]

442
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:05,389
well we didn't even go to parties we

443
00:22:03,409 --> 00:22:08,389
literally just straight hung out at our

444
00:22:05,388 --> 00:22:10,758
little hemp exchange hemp store and

445
00:22:08,388 --> 00:22:13,038
people came to us and we puffed and

446
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:15,679
chuffed and just talked non-stop about

447
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:17,658
this book I bought one of the hundred

448
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:19,100
percent pure hemp ones the year that he

449
00:22:17,659 --> 00:22:24,470
did them at the cup there for a hundred

450
00:22:19,099 --> 00:22:26,240
us that was probably 96 or 97 I have one

451
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:28,970
of those it's funny you know how much

452
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:31,370
stuff has changed I had an ex girlfriend

453
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:34,190
that I ran into on social media over the

454
00:22:31,369 --> 00:22:36,258
past couple of weeks and this chick

455
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:40,970
would we broke up she she threatened to

456
00:22:36,259 --> 00:22:42,558
call the RCMP on me anyway this week she

457
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:53,929
was throwing up the cannabis community

458
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:56,119
hashtag so what what's your trip on it

459
00:22:53,929 --> 00:22:57,769
Ryan cuz I know a lot of people and I

460
00:22:56,119 --> 00:23:01,369
sort of see the point

461
00:22:57,769 --> 00:23:04,399
I get it I see the hypocrisy on seeing

462
00:23:01,369 --> 00:23:07,069
you know people from law enforcement and

463
00:23:04,398 --> 00:23:09,888
people in positions of power that fought

464
00:23:07,069 --> 00:23:11,450
this plant for so long and I kinda I can

465
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:13,758
see that one side of the fence where I'm

466
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:15,319
like well [ __ ] those guys they shouldn't

467
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:16,610
be allowed to play they shouldn't be

468
00:23:15,319 --> 00:23:18,798
allowed to be involved and they

469
00:23:16,609 --> 00:23:21,619
certainly shouldn't be allowed to

470
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:24,168
[ __ ] hold some monopoly over the

471
00:23:21,619 --> 00:23:26,808
people that fought for it for all these

472
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:29,778
years but then another part of me is

473
00:23:26,808 --> 00:23:31,940
kind of like we got them like they're in

474
00:23:29,778 --> 00:23:35,058
like the the very people that were the

475
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:36,679
Destroyers for so long now like I mean

476
00:23:35,058 --> 00:23:38,450
really when I think about who I was

477
00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:40,909
preaching to the most over all these

478
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:43,190
years it was them it was like stop doing

479
00:23:40,909 --> 00:23:45,620
this like just change the laws like

480
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:48,048
don't keep doing this and now now

481
00:23:45,619 --> 00:23:50,418
they're doing it and even more so doing

482
00:23:48,048 --> 00:23:52,759
it like jumping both feet in like I want

483
00:23:50,419 --> 00:23:56,919
to be involved in this part of me is

484
00:23:52,759 --> 00:23:59,509
like huh we're we flip the script

485
00:23:56,919 --> 00:24:01,370
people aren't like you know if the cops

486
00:23:59,509 --> 00:24:02,690
don't make the laws right the Catholics

487
00:24:01,369 --> 00:24:05,209
by and large I mean like you know the

488
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:06,889
nature of a police people in a power you

489
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:08,509
know they're to like do what they think

490
00:24:06,888 --> 00:24:10,189
is right and they're following like

491
00:24:08,509 --> 00:24:11,720
their cue you know obviously there's

492
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:13,580
cops on the beat that have to make like

493
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:16,850
the discretionary call but

494
00:24:13,579 --> 00:24:17,989
I think it's kind of unfair I'm like at

495
00:24:16,849 --> 00:24:20,089
the same time it's kind of like [ __ ]

496
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:22,249
those cops that were the [ __ ] at

497
00:24:20,089 --> 00:24:24,288
the time because now what's to say that

498
00:24:22,249 --> 00:24:26,600
there's not like reasonable police and

499
00:24:24,288 --> 00:24:28,398
folks that are like you bother me how

500
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:30,288
many of us I'm just as panel own have

501
00:24:28,398 --> 00:24:32,359
dealt with the tops at the at your

502
00:24:30,288 --> 00:24:33,648
inspection and they got the gun and it's

503
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:35,719
the same cop that would've thrown you

504
00:24:33,648 --> 00:24:38,118
but that's the same power this just

505
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:39,200
following a different rule book it's

506
00:24:38,118 --> 00:24:41,388
like you kind of got to give them the

507
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,860
benefit of the doubt you know cuz now

508
00:24:41,388 --> 00:24:49,839
there's just that much less [ __ ] for

509
00:24:42,859 --> 00:24:52,699
cops the hassle a spell right every cop

510
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:56,028
becoming a marijuana grower marijuana

511
00:24:52,700 --> 00:25:04,759
will say look marijuana marijuana

512
00:24:56,028 --> 00:25:10,489
whatever yeah Sam with the harsh

513
00:25:04,759 --> 00:25:13,429
realities you know have the right to be

514
00:25:10,489 --> 00:25:15,409
involved and it's certainly distasteful

515
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:18,499
that some of these people like you know

516
00:25:15,409 --> 00:25:19,879
Julian Fantino for example or you know

517
00:25:18,499 --> 00:25:22,129
Brian Mulrooney former prime minister

518
00:25:19,878 --> 00:25:23,538
Karen is involved with acreage holdings

519
00:25:22,128 --> 00:25:25,988
in the states that which is going to be

520
00:25:23,538 --> 00:25:29,929
a big play coming out of the East Coast

521
00:25:25,989 --> 00:25:32,210
yeah the house is is in that shenanigan

522
00:25:29,929 --> 00:25:34,220
stew and it sucks to see but at the same

523
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:36,980
time I feel the same way as Sam all

524
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:39,440
these prohibitionists deserve to you

525
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:40,909
know they've changed their realities and

526
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,730
they're gonna change the reality further

527
00:25:40,909 --> 00:25:45,169
for everybody else so you know as stated

528
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:46,759
before we didn't leave with everything

529
00:25:45,169 --> 00:25:52,460
at once when I can get it back all at

530
00:25:46,759 --> 00:25:54,349
once it takes time well it's not all I

531
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:56,450
mean when it's an open market it's an

532
00:25:54,349 --> 00:25:59,209
open market and you know a lot of these

533
00:25:56,450 --> 00:26:01,909
people have long term established lives

534
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:03,798
and connections and money and that's

535
00:26:01,909 --> 00:26:06,619
what helps you get business done in the

536
00:26:03,798 --> 00:26:08,388
real world I think that you know as a

537
00:26:06,618 --> 00:26:11,269
community we definitely point these

538
00:26:08,388 --> 00:26:12,678
people out um you know hopefully people

539
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:14,659
with ethics will vote with their dollars

540
00:26:12,679 --> 00:26:16,249
and vote support the people that are oh

541
00:26:14,659 --> 00:26:21,409
jeez and I've been doing it for thirty

542
00:26:16,249 --> 00:26:22,669
forty years but you know what our what

543
00:26:21,409 --> 00:26:24,379
are you gonna really gonna do right like

544
00:26:22,669 --> 00:26:26,210
everyone it's legal everybody has a

545
00:26:24,378 --> 00:26:27,349
right to be involved and then you just

546
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:30,380
have course

547
00:26:27,349 --> 00:26:33,459
and in the end what's going to happen is

548
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:36,500
you can produces better cheaper

549
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:39,140
higher-quality more organic more

550
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:40,730
whatever the customer wants you're going

551
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,960
to sell it yeah and that's what we're

552
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:43,339
seeing you know in the Canadian

553
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,870
marketplace at least it's true we got

554
00:26:43,339 --> 00:26:47,209
all these corporate guys are producing

555
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:49,879
you know hundred millions of square feet

556
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:54,500
of acres of absolute bunk like the

557
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:55,880
flowers are [ __ ] garbage right so now

558
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:57,829
they're starting to letting these micro

559
00:26:55,880 --> 00:27:00,409
cultivators in people get in they'll

560
00:26:57,829 --> 00:27:01,699
start small and you know they'll work

561
00:27:00,409 --> 00:27:04,909
there were using the chain the truth of

562
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:06,980
the matter is you know the the person

563
00:27:04,909 --> 00:27:08,510
with the the best flowers has always won

564
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:10,640
the market and that's just not gonna

565
00:27:08,509 --> 00:27:12,440
change right correctly that's what the

566
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:16,909
consumer wants I would add one more

567
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:19,340
thing to that that the ratio that once

568
00:27:16,909 --> 00:27:21,860
was say in the 90s when I would see an

569
00:27:19,339 --> 00:27:23,928
enormous amount of cannabis every week

570
00:27:21,859 --> 00:27:25,869
and there was only a very small

571
00:27:23,929 --> 00:27:28,220
percentage of it that was exceptional

572
00:27:25,869 --> 00:27:29,899
always it's still to this day it's the

573
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:31,370
same thing I think it's just gonna line

574
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:33,080
up in the sense that you said there's

575
00:27:31,369 --> 00:27:34,939
gonna be all these guys growing bunk and

576
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:37,158
don't get me wrong the world loves bunk

577
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:39,679
most of the world is just super happy

578
00:27:37,159 --> 00:27:41,900
with bunk food and bunk beer and bunk

579
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:44,210
everything in their life and of course

580
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:46,070
they're gonna smoke bunker belong with

581
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:47,990
their bunk cigarettes and drink their

582
00:27:46,069 --> 00:27:49,819
bunk booze but then there's another

583
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:52,519
percentage of people that little niche

584
00:27:49,819 --> 00:27:55,158
that you know the IPA breweries sort of

585
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:58,099
came into existence for and cannabis

586
00:27:55,159 --> 00:28:00,350
craft growing whether it's an LP or

587
00:27:58,099 --> 00:28:02,599
whether it's a small-time grower in my

588
00:28:00,349 --> 00:28:04,609
opinion it's the quality that matters I

589
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:07,009
don't care the conditions that comes out

590
00:28:04,609 --> 00:28:09,889
of it that it comes from just as long as

591
00:28:07,009 --> 00:28:12,200
the quality is super OnPoint as long as

592
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:14,809
it was grown properly genetics that were

593
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:16,069
that were properly bred were used so

594
00:28:14,808 --> 00:28:17,690
that you know the plants gonna be

595
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:20,569
something special and not just the same

596
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:22,788
old same old I mean four years in BC it

597
00:28:20,569 --> 00:28:24,859
was curse curse curse curse

598
00:28:22,788 --> 00:28:26,720
it was great if you were you know Johnny

599
00:28:24,859 --> 00:28:28,308
B and loved cush and don't get me wrong

600
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:31,850
I don't mind cush there's some right

601
00:28:28,308 --> 00:28:35,029
over my shoulder but I like other

602
00:28:31,849 --> 00:28:37,240
cultivars person for what long time BC

603
00:28:35,029 --> 00:28:39,819
was hurting just pumping out the Kush

604
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:42,308
well right now

605
00:28:39,819 --> 00:28:44,200
we're seeing at you know craft market

606
00:28:42,308 --> 00:28:46,298
has not gone away in California we still

607
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:50,259
see small craft product and it still

608
00:28:46,298 --> 00:28:52,839
commands its price the market of course

609
00:28:50,259 --> 00:28:56,950
is not to the standards that we set at

610
00:28:52,839 --> 00:29:00,069
BPG because for 18 plus years we bought

611
00:28:56,950 --> 00:29:02,590
at certain ratios and priced at ratios

612
00:29:00,069 --> 00:29:04,269
that we thought were fair and it was

613
00:29:02,589 --> 00:29:05,769
responded by everybody in the market

614
00:29:04,269 --> 00:29:08,048
that's why people continue to come back

615
00:29:05,769 --> 00:29:09,638
if you don't have good pot for good

616
00:29:08,048 --> 00:29:11,200
price and a story they're going

617
00:29:09,638 --> 00:29:13,808
somewhere else and they can go somewhere

618
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,399
else so unfortunately through the

619
00:29:13,808 --> 00:29:17,798
distributor reality that we see in

620
00:29:15,398 --> 00:29:20,709
California it's not to the standards

621
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:23,558
that we set whereas in Nevada when I

622
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:26,288
recently visited there it has and was so

623
00:29:23,558 --> 00:29:28,989
in time it will get better but at the

624
00:29:26,288 --> 00:29:30,970
same time the craft market is still here

625
00:29:28,989 --> 00:29:34,028
it's just had to professionalize itself

626
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:35,200
and not everybody could make the leap or

627
00:29:34,028 --> 00:29:37,690
could afford to make the leaf or

628
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:39,038
wellington red complete you know yeah I

629
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:40,989
was just down there and I was actually

630
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:44,348
quite surprised you know the Cali rags

631
00:29:40,989 --> 00:29:45,519
you know there's all these contamination

632
00:29:44,348 --> 00:29:48,428
issues that have always been in the

633
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:50,200
market and now they have this regulated

634
00:29:48,429 --> 00:29:51,580
system they've actually really honed

635
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:53,710
down the amount of weeds that is

636
00:29:51,579 --> 00:29:54,970
available in the market like one of the

637
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:56,590
suppliers was telling me you know they

638
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:58,690
wouldn't have a pen company and they

639
00:29:56,589 --> 00:30:01,089
were saying try by a hundred liters of

640
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:04,599
clean distillate that actually makes the

641
00:30:01,089 --> 00:30:06,009
grade right that actually will pass the

642
00:30:04,598 --> 00:30:08,200
regulations and it's just not available

643
00:30:06,009 --> 00:30:09,909
in the marketplace to the point the

644
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:12,580
growers are getting three thousand plus

645
00:30:09,909 --> 00:30:14,649
bucks a pound again right for right for

646
00:30:12,579 --> 00:30:17,798
the for the stuff that truly is fire and

647
00:30:14,648 --> 00:30:19,928
and and meets the grade right it makes

648
00:30:17,798 --> 00:30:22,388
it passes the regulation which is well

649
00:30:19,929 --> 00:30:24,038
that's that we're only up to series to

650
00:30:22,388 --> 00:30:25,778
we're getting ready to for phase three

651
00:30:24,038 --> 00:30:28,148
which is happening January 1st which is

652
00:30:25,778 --> 00:30:30,970
adds more microbial testing and more

653
00:30:28,148 --> 00:30:34,178
pesticide testing which I'm afraid we're

654
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:36,220
gonna see bubble hash go the way for a

655
00:30:34,179 --> 00:30:38,019
while because it fails the microbial

656
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:40,179
tests just off of Berkeley

657
00:30:38,019 --> 00:30:42,909
municipalities water which is you know

658
00:30:40,179 --> 00:30:44,619
all of these waste water so it shows

659
00:30:42,909 --> 00:30:46,570
also we need different standards for

660
00:30:44,618 --> 00:30:48,759
different products we don't have it

661
00:30:46,569 --> 00:30:50,798
finally refined at the science level

662
00:30:48,759 --> 00:30:53,230
just for something like you know water

663
00:30:50,798 --> 00:30:59,200
hash why don't they just filter that one

664
00:30:53,230 --> 00:31:00,849
i money cause buying coke be lazy they

665
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:04,149
should also be using like a stainless

666
00:31:00,849 --> 00:31:08,769
steel sort of GMP compliant unit as well

667
00:31:04,148 --> 00:31:10,808
I only have two people currently what's

668
00:31:08,769 --> 00:31:18,190
that Chris I said people out here

669
00:31:10,808 --> 00:31:20,859
wouldn't even be able to spell GM the

670
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:24,100
city of Flint Michigan right you drink

671
00:31:20,859 --> 00:31:26,288
water in Flint Michigan and you die so

672
00:31:24,099 --> 00:31:29,048
there's bigger infrastructure issues

673
00:31:26,288 --> 00:31:31,450
about water in this country other than

674
00:31:29,048 --> 00:31:33,158
making water house holy [ __ ] of course

675
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:35,169
but we're in hash Church dude don't get

676
00:31:33,159 --> 00:31:38,980
me wrong if you want to start the water

677
00:31:35,169 --> 00:31:41,919
processing cleanliness chat room on your

678
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:43,569
channel by all means dude I'll come in

679
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:45,460
and talk about that but yeah of course

680
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:47,079
and forget about Flint Michigan that's

681
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:49,058
just being American there's been

682
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:51,148
countries in the world that have haven't

683
00:31:49,058 --> 00:31:54,190
had clean water for a very long time

684
00:31:51,148 --> 00:31:56,829
well nobody remembers that hamper

685
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:58,840
mediates you know have like if you grow

686
00:31:56,829 --> 00:32:00,908
have next to a heavy metals

687
00:31:58,839 --> 00:32:02,769
you know processing plant you're

688
00:32:00,909 --> 00:32:04,840
probably gonna have heavy metals in your

689
00:32:02,769 --> 00:32:07,269
hand oh yeah it definitely does with

690
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:09,099
radioactive nucleotides there's certain

691
00:32:07,269 --> 00:32:11,349
plants that are fight or remediate of

692
00:32:09,099 --> 00:32:13,750
that pull up heavy metals and stuff I'm

693
00:32:11,349 --> 00:32:15,250
sure cannabis would pull up the majority

694
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:29,888
of them my other cold

695
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:36,970
they're called bio accumulators huh what

696
00:32:29,888 --> 00:32:38,558
was that ryan like certain ions will be

697
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:40,509
pulled up into the bruised but not into

698
00:32:38,558 --> 00:32:42,038
the plant so i think that there's a

699
00:32:40,509 --> 00:32:44,319
whole bunch of that we still have yet to

700
00:32:42,038 --> 00:32:52,210
learn about that whole process of the

701
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:53,558
bio accumulation of out of the soil and

702
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:55,690
then it gets stuck in the plant whether

703
00:32:53,558 --> 00:32:57,369
it's on the roots of the fibers or you

704
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:59,679
know does it go up into the england

705
00:32:57,369 --> 00:33:06,428
flowers we don't really know that yet it

706
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:07,090
was that was discovered by joe Strobel

707
00:33:06,429 --> 00:33:11,050
and jeff

708
00:33:07,089 --> 00:33:13,269
in Ontario in 19 well maybe 1995 they

709
00:33:11,049 --> 00:33:15,579
they grew their first field in 94 and

710
00:33:13,269 --> 00:33:17,349
Joe was a tobacco farmer and they

711
00:33:15,579 --> 00:33:18,849
sprayed radium-226

712
00:33:17,349 --> 00:33:22,029
on the field which is a radioactive

713
00:33:18,849 --> 00:33:25,750
nucleotide and so I guess they have to

714
00:33:22,029 --> 00:33:27,700
measure the field if you know before

715
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:29,559
during and after all these different

716
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:32,170
sort of times they have to measure the

717
00:33:29,559 --> 00:33:34,720
field and they found the numbers to be

718
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:37,060
like too low after the hemp was cut down

719
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,980
and they they they tested the hemp and

720
00:33:37,059 --> 00:33:41,409
found out that it had pulled a bunch of

721
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:44,349
this radium-226 out of the soil and had

722
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:46,870
stored it and I guess in the cellulose

723
00:33:44,349 --> 00:33:51,309
and fibers of the of the stock the oh

724
00:33:46,869 --> 00:33:54,039
[ __ ] I had an actual study that broke it

725
00:33:51,309 --> 00:33:56,919
down they actually grew hemp on a Polish

726
00:33:54,039 --> 00:34:01,089
having metals factory and it just was

727
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:02,860
yeah my gosh I look back on it now and

728
00:34:01,089 --> 00:34:04,569
see if it was in the roots or in the

729
00:34:02,859 --> 00:34:07,990
stalk or in the flower because that's a

730
00:34:04,569 --> 00:34:09,400
good point chimera yeah well there's

731
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:11,050
just a man like there's probably a whole

732
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:13,119
bunch of lessons that we still have to

733
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:19,000
learn about that I bet there's you know

734
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:22,989
cannabis is remarkable well did we lose

735
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:24,579
him okay my poster keeps doing this it's

736
00:34:22,989 --> 00:34:28,389
OCD I should just get a new piece of

737
00:34:24,579 --> 00:34:30,639
tape I actually work what's that mark

738
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:36,009
right at cannabis was remarkable for

739
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:39,129
doing right yeah I'm sure he'll be back

740
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:41,590
in to talk here in a second I I just got

741
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:43,750
back from Manitoba I was there at a at

742
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:46,180
the Canadian hemp Alliance hemp trade

743
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:51,940
Alliance conference welcome back Ryan

744
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:55,059
yes sorry remarkable remarkable you know

745
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:56,559
plasticity and traits right on every

746
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:59,980
single character that you look at the

747
00:34:56,559 --> 00:35:02,349
plant leaf shaped stem width height

748
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:04,809
yield seed yield seed size whatever

749
00:35:02,349 --> 00:35:06,069
there's a variation right so I bet that

750
00:35:04,809 --> 00:35:08,799
will probably end up seeing that some

751
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:10,750
varieties are able to bioaccumulate

752
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,190
faster and are more tolerant than other

753
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:15,789
varieties we just don't know any of that

754
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:17,920
information yet mm-hmm

755
00:35:15,789 --> 00:35:19,809
yeah you know what this is this is good

756
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,789
stuff I wished I saw more stuff like

757
00:35:19,809 --> 00:35:23,670
this at the hip

758
00:35:20,789 --> 00:35:25,679
since in Manitoba it was there was a lot

759
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:28,139
of sort of talking but it was all this

760
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:29,969
sort of delusional CBD talk where they

761
00:35:28,139 --> 00:35:33,150
thought they were gonna you know set up

762
00:35:29,969 --> 00:35:36,750
an entire industry extracting the 1% of

763
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:38,550
CBD that's in the plant I'm also hearing

764
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:41,070
with problems in states where it's legal

765
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:43,010
slash medical and hemp is growing as

766
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:45,480
cross pollination is happening and

767
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:47,820
people's crops are getting seated and

768
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:50,250
people are getting angry and when you're

769
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:53,400
financially ruined by something is like

770
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:56,699
that it's gonna bring out a whole bunch

771
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:58,650
of ethic issues regarding the reality of

772
00:35:56,699 --> 00:36:01,679
what they're doing it in the reality of

773
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:03,900
what its gonna take to actually be you

774
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:05,609
know a high grade cannabis farmer you

775
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:07,619
know it's kind of no different than

776
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:09,900
having an avocado farmer as a neighbor

777
00:36:07,619 --> 00:36:10,619
in California that's doing the plane or

778
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:13,470
the helicopter

779
00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:14,789
Ava drop every two weeks and you're like

780
00:36:13,469 --> 00:36:16,379
right next door to them and it's like

781
00:36:14,789 --> 00:36:18,630
what are you gonna do you can't control

782
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:20,730
that [ __ ] it's going all the way over to

783
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:24,000
your crop and your crops just absorbing

784
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:25,530
it yeah well there's nothing yet again

785
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,329
it's the evolution of an industry right

786
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:28,830
I mean when you start when you turn the

787
00:36:27,329 --> 00:36:32,789
switch on an industry everything doesn't

788
00:36:28,829 --> 00:36:35,849
run right off the bat there's all these

789
00:36:32,789 --> 00:36:38,130
portions of the value chain like seeds

790
00:36:35,849 --> 00:36:40,529
like high CBD seeds with that are less

791
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:42,329
than 0.3 percent THC yeah there are

792
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:44,610
actually registered varieties right look

793
00:36:42,329 --> 00:36:46,679
you can't in Canada you can't just if

794
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:48,900
you begin a clone that's licked you know

795
00:36:46,679 --> 00:36:51,779
say you have a magical clone that's 28%

796
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:54,450
CBD acid and it produces less than 0.3

797
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:56,940
percent THC so it's considered hemp you

798
00:36:54,449 --> 00:37:01,019
can't plant that variety underneath it's

799
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:07,200
got to be in the registry I met the guy

800
00:37:01,019 --> 00:37:11,699
who runs that the seed registry once a

801
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:15,389
year and do you know what the

802
00:37:11,699 --> 00:37:17,789
regulations are for that they want you

803
00:37:15,389 --> 00:37:21,119
to R&amp;D the strip the cultivar for three

804
00:37:17,789 --> 00:37:23,880
seasons three three years and and bring

805
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:25,589
them the data that shows the THC and you

806
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:27,840
know all the sort of things that they

807
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:29,700
want and basically it's it takes three

808
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:35,850
years to get a cultivar registered into

809
00:37:29,699 --> 00:37:37,980
the seed registry you could use data

810
00:37:35,849 --> 00:37:40,049
from other countries like they want

811
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:41,820
three years or the data for sure but

812
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:43,050
anyway you have years of trials for

813
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:45,000
example with varieties in the States

814
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:47,190
which is you might be able to shave a

815
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,679
year off but I'd be surprised if you got

816
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:51,090
it in in under a year I was talking to

817
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:52,889
the guy I wish it was something

818
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:54,990
different that's crazy because I've got

819
00:37:52,889 --> 00:37:56,940
this variety that's you know it's it's

820
00:37:54,989 --> 00:37:58,859
again it's a low cannabinoid producing

821
00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:04,619
plant but it produces like two to three

822
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:06,570
CBD acid by weight let's get it in the

823
00:38:04,619 --> 00:38:08,730
point but in order to plant it you need

824
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:10,620
to do it under a research license which

825
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:12,960
is you know a pain in the ass because

826
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:14,549
you need special exemptions to be able

827
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:18,420
to harvest and use the molecules

828
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:21,840
mm-hmm and it's just pretty sure pretty

829
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:31,409
sure that if you have a variety register

830
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:33,600
like a variety or any other yeah they

831
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:35,429
want trials in Canada always though just

832
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:38,099
to show that so they're definitely

833
00:38:35,429 --> 00:38:41,730
scared of these plants somehow magically

834
00:38:38,099 --> 00:38:45,389
producing 800 percent THC and staining

835
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:47,130
an environment right so if they always

836
00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:48,869
want some data it's it's a bit

837
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:50,910
ridiculous but yeah you're right I think

838
00:38:48,869 --> 00:38:52,380
it does you know like the ones that

839
00:38:50,909 --> 00:38:54,960
we're talking about Sam or you know

840
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:58,650
related to registered varieties in Kent

841
00:38:54,960 --> 00:39:02,010
in in Europe but man is never a pain in

842
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:04,440
the ass yeah it sure is you know in the

843
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:06,480
me in the meantime there's no CVG I said

844
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:09,240
there's no CVG cannabis Jarrell in the

845
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:11,280
marketplace right he really could be

846
00:39:09,239 --> 00:39:16,589
using this stuff we've got the varieties

847
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:20,460
that can grow it with paperwork's

848
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:22,019
keeping it down it's nice and soon he'll

849
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:25,199
my state can't tell the difference

850
00:39:22,019 --> 00:39:32,300
between you know hemp th I mean CBD and

851
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:34,889
you know indica CBD indica pardon me

852
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:38,310
that's because there is no different CBD

853
00:39:34,889 --> 00:39:41,849
CBD tell that chemically dr. but the

854
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:44,279
state of California says no and there is

855
00:39:41,849 --> 00:39:45,389
one big difference that mean difference

856
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:48,269
of course is that

857
00:39:45,389 --> 00:39:50,730
from an indica variety you'll get a lot

858
00:39:48,269 --> 00:39:55,139
of [ __ ] heat and put my hips right

859
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:57,929
into a little bit well I have a bottle

860
00:39:55,139 --> 00:40:00,359
of Stevie G right here and a number of

861
00:39:57,929 --> 00:40:03,719
them and they're not that hard to come

862
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:07,849
by so I would submit that you're that's

863
00:40:03,719 --> 00:40:10,619
an erroneous oh not for Canada it isn't

864
00:40:07,849 --> 00:40:13,170
already can't well we're limited there

865
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:15,000
John yeah there's like there's federal

866
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:16,889
regulations that are dictating all these

867
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:20,719
problems it's about the availability of

868
00:40:16,889 --> 00:40:22,799
the of the molecule what's it good for

869
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:25,319
cannabis Jarrell has a whole bunch of

870
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:28,340
uses they're finding if they've just

871
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:33,990
showed that it's a cb1 receptor agonist

872
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:36,150
it's they've found that it has activity

873
00:40:33,989 --> 00:40:39,089
against like the superbugs like a bar

874
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:44,450
does not get you high just for you know

875
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:44,450
rounding purposes right not an argument

876
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:51,570
you know what I would I would say what's

877
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:53,610
it good for I would say for producing

878
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:57,030
the entire cannabinoid and terpene

879
00:40:53,610 --> 00:41:02,240
profile makes a pretty good building

880
00:40:57,030 --> 00:41:05,790
block we're not weak in skin lesions

881
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:12,539
I've been tearing it with somebody who

882
00:41:05,789 --> 00:41:15,300
had suspicious about and she started

883
00:41:12,539 --> 00:41:18,199
applying this and a week later they

884
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:18,200
dried up and disappeared

885
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:26,400
yeah that's not I mean that's cool it's

886
00:41:24,989 --> 00:41:30,779
not really a trial but what they've done

887
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:34,289
it you know they definitely have it's it

888
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:36,740
helps suppress things like medicine

889
00:41:34,289 --> 00:41:39,000
resistance triple streptococcus straight

890
00:41:36,739 --> 00:41:41,039
which is mrs a which is one of the

891
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,630
superbugs but they have a hard time

892
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:45,889
treating with antibiotics and it's able

893
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:48,090
to suppress that then it's got these

894
00:41:45,889 --> 00:41:49,469
anti-inflammatory properties and you

895
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:51,750
know I think we're gonna find that it's

896
00:41:49,469 --> 00:41:54,239
like CBD you know like we will find for

897
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:56,280
all these cannabinoids I'm like we did

898
00:41:54,239 --> 00:41:57,809
for CBD there's not just one thing it's

899
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:59,340
good for it helps a whole bunch of stuff

900
00:41:57,809 --> 00:42:01,139
but really you can

901
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:03,110
test that or you can't put that into the

902
00:42:01,139 --> 00:42:06,150
market to start having people do these

903
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:08,700
you know what it's not really a clinical

904
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:10,590
trial but it's like collecting community

905
00:42:08,699 --> 00:42:12,599
data until the molecule is out in the

906
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:14,430
marketplace it's like the issue that

907
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:15,869
Mark and I run into it the hydrogenated

908
00:42:14,429 --> 00:42:17,339
can have an ID so you can make them but

909
00:42:15,869 --> 00:42:18,929
like who the hell can you really make

910
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:25,500
them can you really make them somewhere

911
00:42:18,929 --> 00:42:27,629
like we're sort of interesting thing

912
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:29,880
we're like science and people's interest

913
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:34,050
is far quicker and far more advanced and

914
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:35,730
like working handle it's like how do you

915
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:39,030
I mean you make these products and how

916
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:42,840
do you even like test for cannabinoids

917
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:44,370
like will you have to like CBG in

918
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:48,800
California I remember on the roads but

919
00:42:44,369 --> 00:42:50,730
you know you can 0% active cannabinoids

920
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:57,630
products and now someone has to know

921
00:42:50,730 --> 00:43:00,380
about it to like oh and especially with

922
00:42:57,630 --> 00:43:03,900
all the available connect actually

923
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:05,550
pumped out here in quantity over what's

924
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:06,990
going on with yourself when your your

925
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:07,260
petri dish studies on all that kind of

926
00:43:06,989 --> 00:43:09,179
stuff

927
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:14,180
I know you had some of that being sent

928
00:43:09,179 --> 00:43:16,889
over to Aberdeen what's his name dr.

929
00:43:14,179 --> 00:43:18,269
Pertwee did you ever get that study

930
00:43:16,889 --> 00:43:21,809
those studies going to get your receptor

931
00:43:18,269 --> 00:43:23,849
binding studies everything done no not

932
00:43:21,809 --> 00:43:25,849
yet I don't know what I don't know what

933
00:43:23,849 --> 00:43:38,869
mark status is mark Scott's relationship

934
00:43:25,849 --> 00:43:38,869
I'm just making the hexahydrate

935
00:43:39,289 --> 00:43:51,059
you're muted big boy it's still muted

936
00:43:49,489 --> 00:43:54,029
that's weird

937
00:43:51,059 --> 00:43:55,980
here let me go look in the am i unmuted

938
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:58,860
down oh yeah you are

939
00:43:55,980 --> 00:44:03,650
okay alright yeah we're not working with

940
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:06,300
Pertwee anymore he wasn't interested

941
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:09,068
after all and looking at these for some

942
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:13,999
reasons so we have

943
00:44:09,068 --> 00:44:19,369
enlisted the services of mo says Moreno

944
00:44:13,998 --> 00:44:23,959
who's over in Spain to do those studies

945
00:44:19,369 --> 00:44:25,670
for us and we're working with a couple

946
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:29,809
other groups I don't know how much I can

947
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:31,489
talk about cuz I'm under NDA so yeah

948
00:44:29,809 --> 00:44:34,999
we're gonna try to figure out as much as

949
00:44:31,489 --> 00:44:36,858
we possibly can on the safety and

950
00:44:34,998 --> 00:44:40,669
efficacy of these things and understand

951
00:44:36,858 --> 00:44:42,889
what the hydrogenation does to attenuate

952
00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:45,588
the activity of the tetrahydrocannabinol

953
00:44:42,889 --> 00:44:48,108
you know so the plan makes

954
00:44:45,588 --> 00:44:50,028
tetrahydrocannabinol there's another

955
00:44:48,108 --> 00:44:52,818
chemical step to convert them in the

956
00:44:50,028 --> 00:44:55,210
hexahydrate cannabinoids and that's just

957
00:44:52,818 --> 00:44:58,788
in the series of tetrahydrocannabinol

958
00:44:55,210 --> 00:45:01,338
being able to undergo dehydrogenation up

959
00:44:58,789 --> 00:45:04,430
to cannabinol which is just the aromatic

960
00:45:01,338 --> 00:45:07,219
airman cessation of the methyl

961
00:45:04,429 --> 00:45:09,919
cyclohexane ring we've just reduced it

962
00:45:07,219 --> 00:45:13,130
taking it down all the way you know and

963
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:14,930
and a THC is something that you know has

964
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:17,719
been previously described and was

965
00:45:14,929 --> 00:45:20,509
previously looked at it's it's known

966
00:45:17,719 --> 00:45:24,588
that it does undergo metabolic oxidation

967
00:45:20,509 --> 00:45:27,528
similar to the THC derivatives but you

968
00:45:24,588 --> 00:45:31,159
know you know generate eleven hydroxy

969
00:45:27,528 --> 00:45:33,108
THC because the the double bonds been

970
00:45:31,159 --> 00:45:35,778
reduced but there's a whole bunch of

971
00:45:33,108 --> 00:45:37,759
other things that we can do you know

972
00:45:35,778 --> 00:45:40,460
hydrogenated some of these minor

973
00:45:37,759 --> 00:45:42,829
cannabinoids as well but just try to

974
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:46,929
assess you know what is the impact that

975
00:45:42,829 --> 00:45:49,548
hydrogenation extra chemical step has on

976
00:45:46,929 --> 00:45:51,919
the chemical modification of these

977
00:45:49,548 --> 00:45:53,298
already biologically active compounds so

978
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:56,690
that's really interesting you say that

979
00:45:53,298 --> 00:45:58,548
it won't make eleven hydroxy upon

980
00:45:56,690 --> 00:46:02,829
metabolization on the liver that could

981
00:45:58,548 --> 00:46:02,829
actually be a hugely valuable

982
00:46:02,889 --> 00:46:07,848
pharmacists kinetic property I mean

983
00:46:05,059 --> 00:46:10,059
that's really interesting that's huge

984
00:46:07,849 --> 00:46:12,920
that's the biggest problem I have with

985
00:46:10,059 --> 00:46:14,960
edibles and other people I that I know

986
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:17,150
that are said to be more sensitive to

987
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:19,338
edibles is that it turns to the Alexa

988
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:19,559
hydroxy metabolite in the liver and I

989
00:46:19,338 --> 00:46:23,369
mean

990
00:46:19,559 --> 00:46:26,579
the old hydroxy metalitz unpredictable

991
00:46:23,369 --> 00:46:29,910
you're not used to it you you go from

992
00:46:26,579 --> 00:46:40,349
his master - yeah very uncomfortable if

993
00:46:29,909 --> 00:46:42,239
you can get to knocked out yeah I think

994
00:46:40,349 --> 00:46:44,818
it's completely different for a cannabis

995
00:46:42,239 --> 00:46:47,818
user someone who regularly uses cannabis

996
00:46:44,818 --> 00:46:50,099
and whose body is already sensitized to

997
00:46:47,818 --> 00:46:51,989
that metabolite it's just more

998
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:54,749
attenuated I guess when it comes through

999
00:46:51,989 --> 00:46:56,670
the digestive tract you know and all in

1000
00:46:54,748 --> 00:47:00,448
one burst you know and gets into your

1001
00:46:56,670 --> 00:47:03,869
blood it doesn't have the you know does

1002
00:47:00,449 --> 00:47:05,639
have the cb1 activity but it's generally

1003
00:47:03,869 --> 00:47:06,869
thought of that it's too polar and

1004
00:47:05,639 --> 00:47:08,728
doesn't cross the blood-brain barrier

1005
00:47:06,869 --> 00:47:12,269
which is why you get that incredible

1006
00:47:08,728 --> 00:47:14,429
body hi you know you oversaturate all

1007
00:47:12,268 --> 00:47:17,399
the other cannabinoid receptors in your

1008
00:47:14,429 --> 00:47:18,778
body not your brain in your body so

1009
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:21,630
that's why I always tell people to keep

1010
00:47:18,778 --> 00:47:23,489
edibles in their mouth and suck on it

1011
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:25,920
like a like a cough drop

1012
00:47:23,489 --> 00:47:28,769
you know don't ya let it go in your

1013
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:30,449
stomach throw in a little dehydration

1014
00:47:28,768 --> 00:47:34,018
and some jet lag from traveling to

1015
00:47:30,449 --> 00:47:35,579
Amsterdam and I've seen some people do

1016
00:47:34,018 --> 00:47:39,538
some face wallops right on the

1017
00:47:35,579 --> 00:47:42,568
cobblestone you know we a lot more

1018
00:47:39,539 --> 00:47:44,719
people tried the h8c a you know we're at

1019
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:48,150
the bisque on and so we got a lot more

1020
00:47:44,719 --> 00:47:50,608
input on you know how it makes people

1021
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:53,489
feel definitely there's a heaviness and

1022
00:47:50,608 --> 00:47:56,188
a high to it I think it's less intense

1023
00:47:53,489 --> 00:48:02,130
than THC but definitely something that

1024
00:47:56,188 --> 00:48:05,009
is definitely modulated by terpenes just

1025
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:11,910
like you would expect a cannabinoid yeah

1026
00:48:05,009 --> 00:48:14,880
the one thing if I draw a little

1027
00:48:11,909 --> 00:48:16,858
terpenes as well right well the stuff

1028
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:19,979
that we made a bid on stuff that I made

1029
00:48:16,858 --> 00:48:23,179
for biscone was just a from from a

1030
00:48:19,978 --> 00:48:25,889
starting material was a THC a crystal

1031
00:48:23,179 --> 00:48:29,778
but there was there was you guys gave me

1032
00:48:25,889 --> 00:48:29,778
two pens I think the one the first night

1033
00:48:29,969 --> 00:48:35,319
that was a year ago man that yeah a year

1034
00:48:33,039 --> 00:48:38,590
ago we made pens and those were flavored

1035
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:41,080
with her profiles well we brought that

1036
00:48:38,590 --> 00:48:41,950
this year resist stuff which is just you

1037
00:48:41,079 --> 00:48:45,069
know this

1038
00:48:41,949 --> 00:48:47,279
in addition platinum cookies we made I

1039
00:48:45,070 --> 00:48:49,809
took some platinum cookie sauce and and

1040
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:51,550
hydrogenated it and we call the

1041
00:48:49,809 --> 00:48:56,199
palladium cookies because it's [ __ ]

1042
00:48:51,550 --> 00:49:10,960
genius but the stuff was [ __ ] tasty

1043
00:48:56,199 --> 00:49:12,699
and interesting do you shoulda hit me up

1044
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:27,780
I was in the same room I think in the

1045
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:27,779
wind it's gonna be a full week next year

1046
00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:37,780
three-day trip I agree but they're

1047
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:40,659
making it a whole week now for the first

1048
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:44,980
time which I've never been down there

1049
00:49:40,659 --> 00:49:47,589
and someone from California had given me

1050
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:49,719
a little bit of some psychedelics and

1051
00:49:47,590 --> 00:49:56,740
man those the way those analog lights

1052
00:49:49,719 --> 00:49:58,089
move at all yeah I actually really liked

1053
00:49:56,739 --> 00:50:00,219
old town it was pretty cool there's

1054
00:49:58,090 --> 00:50:04,030
these you know these really young card

1055
00:50:00,219 --> 00:50:05,439
kids african-american kid that was doing

1056
00:50:04,030 --> 00:50:09,730
card tricks it was really actually quite

1057
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:12,570
impressed with such a young kid he

1058
00:50:09,730 --> 00:50:15,039
walked away with a bunch of our money

1059
00:50:12,570 --> 00:50:16,480
card tricks are you getting caught on

1060
00:50:15,039 --> 00:50:18,460
like three-card Monte or whatever like

1061
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:20,349
no no like tricks like we were giving it

1062
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:22,420
to him really he was he was doing some

1063
00:50:20,349 --> 00:50:23,860
pretty impressive stuff you know he'd

1064
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:25,690
come up and he'd try to push you the

1065
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:27,579
card and I'd be you know you'd you'd

1066
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:29,260
have her down I'm saying no no no man I

1067
00:50:27,579 --> 00:50:30,549

00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:32,530
all this stuff and he was actually

1069

on man it looks like a pretty beautiful

1078
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:12,610
day where you're sitting wait that's

1079
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:14,409
funny and puppy now yes it did the

1080
00:51:12,610 --> 00:51:15,880
bright sunlight I had some technical

1081
00:51:14,409 --> 00:51:20,170
difficulties getting on and they're

1082
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:22,960
continuing here right yeah just sitting

1083
00:51:20,170 --> 00:51:25,389
on the patio man next to a couple of the

1084
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:28,240
trees and enjoying the sunlight

1085
00:51:25,389 --> 00:51:30,909
reflecting off the pond and listening to

1086
00:51:28,239 --> 00:51:35,619
some beautiful chat here all the farmers

1087
00:51:30,909 --> 00:51:38,170
done their weight yeah yeah pretty much

1088
00:51:35,619 --> 00:51:42,039
I didn't I did not have many plants this

1089
00:51:38,170 --> 00:51:44,380
year I had one I hurt my back this

1090
00:51:42,039 --> 00:51:48,699
spring and had to learn how to be

1091
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:50,230
something other than a farmer so but

1092
00:51:48,699 --> 00:51:56,139
yeah it's been a beautiful year we

1093
00:51:50,230 --> 00:51:57,760
finally got some rain and we'll get in

1094
00:51:56,139 --> 00:52:00,069
the donations after the kids in the

1095
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:03,160
khalad Reyes Network we might actually

1096
00:52:00,070 --> 00:52:05,620
achieve our goal of being able to

1097
00:52:03,159 --> 00:52:10,210
provide for those families by the end of

1098
00:52:05,619 --> 00:52:14,049
the year yeah yeah no it's a whole bunch

1099
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:16,360
of people are stepping up and we're not

1100
00:52:14,050 --> 00:52:20,650
there yet but yeah it feels like we'll

1101
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:21,910
make it and Wow there was a couple of

1102
00:52:20,650 --> 00:52:24,010
things I wanted to talk about you guys

1103
00:52:21,909 --> 00:52:25,539
were talking about earlier since we're

1104
00:52:24,010 --> 00:52:29,560
talking hash Church one of the things

1105
00:52:25,539 --> 00:52:34,300
water process and microbiology that

1106
00:52:29,559 --> 00:52:35,559
shows up in trichomes I have a question

1107
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:37,450
for people who know a lot more about

1108
00:52:35,559 --> 00:52:40,840
these things than me

1109
00:52:37,449 --> 00:52:43,359
if you're trichomes are clean of plant

1110
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:45,400
material if you do some want some sort

1111
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:47,769
of extraction to pull off any plant

1112
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:51,849
material and just have trichomes

1113
00:52:47,769 --> 00:52:54,789
are things like fungus or bacterial

1114
00:52:51,849 --> 00:52:57,509
growth gonna be a problem because i know

1115
00:52:54,789 --> 00:52:59,599
plant material in trichomes if you try

1116
00:52:57,509 --> 00:53:02,668
press it up you end up with a bunch of

1117
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:04,889
little pockets of plant material where

1118
00:53:02,668 --> 00:53:07,348
moisture can accumulate and fungus can

1119
00:53:04,889 --> 00:53:09,889
grow but if it's clean of trichomes

1120
00:53:07,349 --> 00:53:12,899
what's what's your story on that Sam

1121
00:53:09,889 --> 00:53:15,209
plants are growing super clean and

1122
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:29,458
there's not contamination from other

1123
00:53:15,208 --> 00:53:32,388
sources it's fine but very selling well

1124
00:53:29,458 --> 00:53:35,088
I've been playing I've been playing with

1125
00:53:32,389 --> 00:53:40,739
adding a step to the extraction process

1126
00:53:35,088 --> 00:53:45,179
still using water bags where I put an

1127
00:53:40,739 --> 00:53:50,699
air stone into the water that's rich in

1128
00:53:45,179 --> 00:53:54,659
trichomes but no longer has ice or the

1129
00:53:50,699 --> 00:53:56,338
bulk of the plant material in it and by

1130
00:53:54,659 --> 00:54:00,588
putting an air stone in it and a little

1131
00:53:56,338 --> 00:54:03,869
air you get this wild foaming action

1132
00:54:00,588 --> 00:54:05,518
that I've run through the bags and

1133
00:54:03,869 --> 00:54:07,499
whatnot there doesn't seem to be much in

1134
00:54:05,518 --> 00:54:10,318
the way of trichomes at all but there's

1135
00:54:07,498 --> 00:54:16,738
color plant material seems to come off

1136
00:54:10,318 --> 00:54:18,719
of it and it and yeah I like the results

1137
00:54:16,739 --> 00:54:22,648
I just wanted to throw that out there

1138
00:54:18,719 --> 00:54:26,278
because I like water process hash for my

1139
00:54:22,648 --> 00:54:28,438
own personal use and it seems really

1140
00:54:26,278 --> 00:54:31,289
important that it's just trichomes

1141
00:54:28,438 --> 00:54:33,298
nothing else in there so the the plant

1142
00:54:31,289 --> 00:54:37,829
material being clean is important and

1143
00:54:33,298 --> 00:54:41,219
then meantime yeah water I think is a

1144
00:54:37,829 --> 00:54:43,109
huge issue most most municipal most

1145
00:54:41,219 --> 00:54:45,028
urban environments I'll say like that if

1146
00:54:43,108 --> 00:54:47,848
you've got treated water coming through

1147
00:54:45,028 --> 00:54:50,728
pipes that water at the minimum has

1148
00:54:47,849 --> 00:54:53,459
chlorine or chlorine in it some sort of

1149
00:54:50,728 --> 00:54:54,898
way to keep the biology down and that

1150
00:54:53,458 --> 00:54:57,568
turns into a real nightmare when you're

1151
00:54:54,898 --> 00:55:00,268
trying to do soil biology if you're

1152
00:54:57,568 --> 00:55:03,630
trying to grow your own or have a garden

1153
00:55:00,268 --> 00:55:05,368
where you're encouraging soil biology as

1154
00:55:03,630 --> 00:55:07,679
soon as you use treated water you're

1155
00:55:05,369 --> 00:55:09,269
killing everything it's that's what it's

1156
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:11,400
supposed to do

1157
00:55:09,268 --> 00:55:14,278
but meantime to treat water

1158
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:15,599
to get it so you can use it without

1159
00:55:14,278 --> 00:55:17,248
killing your biology is really

1160
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:23,099
problematic you're talking reverse

1161
00:55:17,248 --> 00:55:25,199
osmosis or extensive introductions of

1162
00:55:23,099 --> 00:55:28,769
colonies the biology into the water

1163
00:55:25,199 --> 00:55:30,568
until they've used up if you will all

1164
00:55:28,768 --> 00:55:30,989
the disinfectants that are in it I don't

1165
00:55:30,568 --> 00:55:34,498
know

1166
00:55:30,989 --> 00:55:35,729
pardon my rambling here but yeah those

1167
00:55:34,498 --> 00:55:38,248
are two things that came really

1168
00:55:35,730 --> 00:55:41,248
important to me is is the cleanliness of

1169
00:55:38,248 --> 00:55:44,489
the work that you're doing for your

1170
00:55:41,248 --> 00:55:46,889
end-users it's really I know I'm talking

1171
00:55:44,489 --> 00:55:48,689
to professionals but for people who are

1172
00:55:46,889 --> 00:55:51,538
doing your own work for you making your

1173
00:55:48,690 --> 00:55:52,920
own medicine however it is the quality

1174
00:55:51,539 --> 00:55:54,480
of your plant material is really

1175
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:57,269
important because the plant itself is

1176
00:55:54,480 --> 00:56:01,740
not going to do any harm the plant can't

1177
00:55:57,268 --> 00:56:04,199
hurt you mmm I think I appreciate your

1178
00:56:01,739 --> 00:56:08,008
your airstone concept I've always just

1179
00:56:04,199 --> 00:56:09,960
used you know like like forced water and

1180
00:56:08,009 --> 00:56:12,389
rinsed it off but that's a very good

1181
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:15,420
idea to just sort of don't you know

1182
00:56:12,389 --> 00:56:17,578
bubble up the water and clean any small

1183
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:20,670
little particulate I think that if

1184
00:56:17,579 --> 00:56:22,589
you're making water hash a very

1185
00:56:20,670 --> 00:56:24,568
important component which I could

1186
00:56:22,588 --> 00:56:27,889
personally not imagine not having access

1187
00:56:24,568 --> 00:56:31,949
to as someone who makes water hash is a

1188
00:56:27,889 --> 00:56:34,650
macro lens or a microscope or something

1189
00:56:31,949 --> 00:56:37,498
that allows you to look very carefully

1190
00:56:34,650 --> 00:56:39,690
and closely and really blow it up you

1191
00:56:37,498 --> 00:56:42,028
know on a 30-inch monitor a 24-inch

1192
00:56:39,690 --> 00:56:43,559
monitor so you can see what's going on

1193
00:56:42,028 --> 00:56:46,108
in there because there's really nothing

1194
00:56:43,559 --> 00:56:47,579
like I mean you can bioassay all day

1195
00:56:46,108 --> 00:56:49,108
long and think you know what's going on

1196
00:56:47,579 --> 00:56:51,210
but when you look at it you see the

1197
00:56:49,108 --> 00:56:53,608
purity of it or the impurity of it for

1198
00:56:51,210 --> 00:56:55,409
that matter it really kind of lets you

1199
00:56:53,608 --> 00:56:58,230
know what's going on a little bit a

1200
00:56:55,409 --> 00:57:01,318
little bit better than assuming do you

1201
00:56:58,230 --> 00:57:03,838
micro sixty or a hundred times

1202
00:57:01,318 --> 00:57:07,048
magnification the trichomes you know

1203
00:57:03,838 --> 00:57:09,389
what I I don't use a microscope like

1204
00:57:07,048 --> 00:57:11,880
that I use a camera and it's a it it

1205
00:57:09,389 --> 00:57:13,798
works on like true macro which is one

1206
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:14,910
one and then it goes to double that

1207
00:57:13,798 --> 00:57:17,460
which is two one

1208
00:57:14,909 --> 00:57:20,219
and it goes through three one four one

1209
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:22,798
and five one and then you can crop those

1210
00:57:20,219 --> 00:57:25,219
images as well so I never really know

1211
00:57:22,798 --> 00:57:27,409
exactly how do

1212
00:57:25,219 --> 00:57:30,669
tailed I am when I when I've gone in for

1213
00:57:27,409 --> 00:57:33,500
the shot I don't know how magnified I am

1214
00:57:30,670 --> 00:57:35,059
you know I don't know if it's 200 or 300

1215
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:38,690
or 150

1216
00:57:35,059 --> 00:57:40,909
I just really have no idea I like

1217
00:57:38,690 --> 00:57:44,599
getting close though as close as

1218
00:57:40,909 --> 00:57:47,659
possible I think the secret also is

1219
00:57:44,599 --> 00:57:51,440
start with really clean plants means

1220
00:57:47,659 --> 00:57:54,710
really clean water and then when you

1221
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:57,460
when you made the hash and separated

1222
00:57:54,710 --> 00:57:59,869
that Earth the resin you have to dry it

1223
00:57:57,460 --> 00:58:02,900
quickly so then it doesn't become

1224
00:57:59,869 --> 00:58:10,280
contaminated with microbiological you

1225
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:12,289
can't be really slowly life requires

1226
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:14,359
water that's the one thing we know about

1227
00:58:12,289 --> 00:58:16,670
life on this planet isn't requires water

1228
00:58:14,358 --> 00:58:18,079
so when you're adding water in you're

1229
00:58:16,670 --> 00:58:19,369
really giving it it's like germinating a

1230
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:23,329
scene you're kind of kick-starting the

1231
00:58:19,369 --> 00:58:26,570
process so it's it's really quick it's

1232
00:58:23,329 --> 00:58:30,650
really good to be fast right in getting

1233
00:58:26,570 --> 00:58:32,539
that that product dried out well if

1234
00:58:30,650 --> 00:58:34,460
you're commercial you're just making it

1235
00:58:32,539 --> 00:58:36,619
for a marketplace it's gonna be a lie of

1236
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:38,809
eliezer it's gonna be a freeze dryer

1237
00:58:36,619 --> 00:58:41,420
whether it's a pharmaceutical grade or a

1238
00:58:38,809 --> 00:58:43,969
laboratory grade or even a home version

1239
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:46,338
it's gonna remove the moisture content

1240
00:58:43,969 --> 00:58:49,159
out under vacuum in a way that you can

1241
00:58:46,338 --> 00:58:54,289
get that hash really really properly dry

1242
00:58:49,159 --> 00:58:56,420
at least void of all moisture and go

1243
00:58:54,289 --> 00:59:08,659
from there I mean otherwise microbials

1244
00:58:56,420 --> 00:59:11,750
are gonna get you you have water and

1245
00:59:08,659 --> 00:59:14,659
those life starts to multiply when

1246
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:17,179
they're doing these you know microbial

1247
00:59:14,659 --> 00:59:19,279
tests or they measure the amount of

1248
00:59:17,179 --> 00:59:22,190
microbial a microbial activity or the

1249
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:24,320
amount of colony forming units and you

1250
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:28,519
know differentiate between the different

1251
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:30,260
species right that's one of the failures

1252
00:59:28,519 --> 00:59:32,719
of these type of testing is that you

1253
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:35,750
could you might have here some kind of

1254
00:59:32,719 --> 00:59:38,118
microbiology that's above the you know

1255
00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:38,929
the safe for the recognized colony

1256
00:59:38,119 --> 00:59:41,329
forming units

1257
00:59:38,929 --> 00:59:43,608
but those colonies themselves are toxic

1258
00:59:41,329 --> 00:59:45,589
or dangerous hmm right so we need to

1259
00:59:43,608 --> 00:59:48,289
have tests that actually accurately

1260
00:59:45,588 --> 00:59:50,389
reflect the you know the potential harm

1261
00:59:48,289 --> 00:59:53,719
of the species when I was just in

1262
00:59:50,389 --> 00:59:56,690
Manitoba I went and visited a one of the

1263
00:59:53,719 --> 01:00:00,078
largest hemp processors in Canada he

1264
00:59:56,690 --> 01:00:02,450
candy hall 5,000 pounds of hemp parts or

1265
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:04,700
hemp seeds into hemp parts every hour

1266
01:00:02,449 --> 01:00:07,009
and the facility was awesome he had like

1267
01:00:04,699 --> 01:00:09,279
a hundred thousand liters of oil in the

1268
01:00:07,010 --> 01:00:14,450
building he it was very impressive

1269
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:16,250
massive quantities of seed and he he

1270
01:00:14,449 --> 01:00:18,318
took them to his lab where they were you

1271
01:00:16,250 --> 01:00:20,119
know measuring colony forming units and

1272
01:00:18,318 --> 01:00:23,058
they were doing ecoli tests and they

1273
01:00:20,119 --> 01:00:24,680
were doing mold and yeast tests it was

1274
01:00:23,059 --> 01:00:27,380
cool to walk through and check out and

1275
01:00:24,679 --> 01:00:31,399
and just see how how they go about doing

1276
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:34,670
that awesome sounds great you get video

1277
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:38,059
that well you know what he didn't it's a

1278
01:00:34,670 --> 01:00:40,880
lot of it is his intellectual property

1279
01:00:38,059 --> 01:00:42,920
and so he didn't I got some photos I can

1280
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:46,250
show you personally but I didn't nothing

1281
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:49,568
that I can but I can share around great

1282
01:00:46,250 --> 01:00:51,920
facility though this guy had it going on

1283
01:00:49,568 --> 01:00:54,199
hey guys I'm just gonna jump in here I

1284
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:55,880
got to I got to bounce a lot got some

1285
01:00:54,199 --> 01:01:00,078
some plans so I appreciate you guys

1286
01:00:55,880 --> 01:01:02,059
having me I was good talking yeah and I

1287
01:01:00,079 --> 01:01:05,329
will see you guys in the future

1288
01:01:02,059 --> 01:01:09,230
hopefully you guys punchy let mo see it

1289
01:01:05,329 --> 01:01:12,740
have a great day thanks Chris

1290
01:01:09,230 --> 01:01:18,849
have a good day always good to have

1291
01:01:12,739 --> 01:01:21,848
Chris in like that dude all right

1292
01:01:18,849 --> 01:01:21,849
Wow

1293
01:01:25,269 --> 01:01:33,559
the hexahydrate cookies yeah it's just

1294
01:01:31,670 --> 01:01:36,470
great to have him as a collaborator on

1295
01:01:33,559 --> 01:01:39,079
that project so he's able to you know

1296
01:01:36,469 --> 01:01:41,029
make some samples to get you know things

1297
01:01:39,079 --> 01:01:44,720
you know out there in the market we've

1298
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:46,329
taken we have hydrogenated CBD that

1299
01:01:44,719 --> 01:01:49,669
we're actually going to be putting into

1300
01:01:46,329 --> 01:01:52,829
dairy products and look for the impact

1301
01:01:49,670 --> 01:01:56,278
that it has on shelf-life and stable

1302
01:01:52,829 --> 01:01:58,528
in efficacy look at as a functional

1303
01:01:56,278 --> 01:02:01,318
ingredient for food as well as

1304
01:01:58,528 --> 01:02:05,778
nutritional so that's very cool

1305
01:02:01,318 --> 01:02:05,778
yeah all kinds of stuff to do there

1306
01:02:09,949 --> 01:02:14,968
what's HAP intro I said are you pouring

1307
01:02:13,108 --> 01:02:20,098
it into milk are you feeding it to the

1308
01:02:14,969 --> 01:02:22,170
cows for you we're putting it into dairy

1309
01:02:20,099 --> 01:02:25,579
fats and stuff like that that's

1310
01:02:22,170 --> 01:02:30,209
conceived exactly what it does to

1311
01:02:25,579 --> 01:02:37,309
enhance you know resistant to oxidative

1312
01:02:30,208 --> 01:02:41,958
breakdown so sorry about that

1313
01:02:37,309 --> 01:02:41,959
your dog's wants to be on hash Church

1314
01:02:42,739 --> 01:02:48,358
watch out for lecithin that's the the

1315
01:02:45,869 --> 01:02:52,829
can be the accelerant that can really

1316
01:02:48,358 --> 01:02:54,808
amp up the THD exponentially in the body

1317
01:02:52,829 --> 01:02:58,410
so be aware of that because it just

1318
01:02:54,809 --> 01:03:02,339
breaks it down so much that the body's

1319
01:02:58,409 --> 01:03:04,048
uptake is pretty badass I added that

1320
01:03:02,338 --> 01:03:05,759
when I was like I years ago when we're

1321
01:03:04,048 --> 01:03:07,588
talking about bond losses that's the

1322
01:03:05,759 --> 01:03:09,329
thing that I would add so now that

1323
01:03:07,588 --> 01:03:13,798
you're talking about adding it to dairy

1324
01:03:09,329 --> 01:03:15,359
and things like that beware of that yeah

1325
01:03:13,798 --> 01:03:17,909
I mean that's actually one of the things

1326
01:03:15,358 --> 01:03:21,808
we're looking to count on right is an

1327
01:03:17,909 --> 01:03:23,338
enhanced uptake so using that effect

1328
01:03:21,809 --> 01:03:27,180
that I think that happens you know

1329
01:03:23,338 --> 01:03:30,358
across the family of you know a variety

1330
01:03:27,179 --> 01:03:32,940
of different things like lessons and you

1331
01:03:30,358 --> 01:03:36,420
know fatty acids and triglycerides which

1332
01:03:32,940 --> 01:03:38,880
are facilitated transport of these very

1333
01:03:36,420 --> 01:03:42,269
hydrophobic molecules into biological

1334
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:44,969
tissues you know I recently met a

1335
01:03:42,268 --> 01:03:48,149
scientist the chemistry guy who has some

1336
01:03:44,969 --> 01:03:51,298
nano emulsification process using silver

1337
01:03:48,150 --> 01:03:54,469
and he uses like these nanites that are

1338
01:03:51,298 --> 01:03:57,150
like a seven nanometers in length

1339
01:03:54,469 --> 01:03:59,309
colonial so we're just yeah it's a

1340
01:03:57,150 --> 01:04:02,639
colloidal silver but what he does is he

1341
01:03:59,309 --> 01:04:06,170
can he can turn on or turn off the

1342
01:04:02,639 --> 01:04:09,079
hydrophobic or hydrophilic nature of

1343
01:04:06,170 --> 01:04:12,170
a molecule he can either make it attract

1344
01:04:09,079 --> 01:04:15,019
or repel with this with this process

1345
01:04:12,170 --> 01:04:17,599
plus he has claims both with the FDA and

1346
01:04:15,019 --> 01:04:19,159
with Health Canada so he has like health

1347
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:20,809
claims that he can make and he's looking

1348
01:04:19,159 --> 01:04:23,289
to make deals with you know people that

1349
01:04:20,809 --> 01:04:25,699
might want to to engage with

1350
01:04:23,289 --> 01:04:27,949
cannabinoids and gain the use of those

1351
01:04:25,699 --> 01:04:29,480
claims that are near impossible to get

1352
01:04:27,949 --> 01:04:31,519
if you were just to try and get those

1353
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:33,980
claims his the health claims like they

1354
01:04:31,519 --> 01:04:37,070
they use this stuff in surgery in open

1355
01:04:33,980 --> 01:04:39,199
wounds and they it's in dentistry and

1356
01:04:37,070 --> 01:04:41,269
and so all sorts of different things but

1357
01:04:39,199 --> 01:04:48,109
very interesting I'm gonna go meet him I

1358
01:04:41,269 --> 01:04:50,090
think next week and he might be I would

1359
01:04:48,110 --> 01:05:11,360
have to check the email I'm not sure

1360
01:04:50,090 --> 01:05:12,740
100% he could be but you're also not

1361
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:17,269
allowed to do it under the Health Canada

1362
01:05:12,739 --> 01:05:19,250
regulations right yeah brand so no this

1363
01:05:17,269 --> 01:05:21,289
was to this was to put into kit like

1364
01:05:19,250 --> 01:05:23,750
cannabinoids and this product to put it

1365
01:05:21,289 --> 01:05:25,969
together he had a whole crazy deck I'm

1366
01:05:23,750 --> 01:05:28,940
not I can't say the name of his company

1367
01:05:25,969 --> 01:05:30,859
but it was a project that embarked was

1368
01:05:28,940 --> 01:05:33,470
looking at

1369
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:35,900
I mean colloidal silver has been used in

1370
01:05:33,469 --> 01:05:38,509
antimicrobial coatings for a Coon's age

1371
01:05:35,900 --> 01:05:42,500
and yeah everything from shopping cart

1372
01:05:38,510 --> 01:05:45,770
handles to surfaces at the airport or

1373
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:47,719
you know coated with I think the product

1374
01:05:45,769 --> 01:05:50,449
used to be called alpha San or microbe

1375
01:05:47,719 --> 01:05:52,639
and and it's yeah it's colloidal silver

1376
01:05:50,449 --> 01:05:54,169
now if you're talking nano silver now

1377
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:56,269
it's not colloidal anymore because

1378
01:05:54,170 --> 01:05:58,369
you're talking about a particular size

1379
01:05:56,269 --> 01:06:01,429
machine colloidal just makes one big

1380
01:05:58,369 --> 01:06:03,769
particle of glamour it but I usually

1381
01:06:01,429 --> 01:06:08,299
think of those kinds of things as being

1382
01:06:03,769 --> 01:06:10,550
not good in general for cannabis

1383
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:13,550
operations because they have very broad

1384
01:06:10,550 --> 01:06:15,650
spectrum you know anti microbial

1385
01:06:13,550 --> 01:06:20,140
activity and as you know that plant

1386
01:06:15,650 --> 01:06:23,079
relies on microbial activity for

1387
01:06:20,139 --> 01:06:26,299
fixation of nitrogen and and other

1388
01:06:23,079 --> 01:06:28,369
essential you know biochemical reactions

1389
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:30,289
that have to happen where if you knock

1390
01:06:28,369 --> 01:06:32,059
out some of the lower runs on the food

1391
01:06:30,289 --> 01:06:35,389
ladder which is what those

1392
01:06:32,059 --> 01:06:38,289
broad-spectrum things do you just

1393
01:06:35,389 --> 01:06:41,118
destabilize the natural balance of

1394
01:06:38,289 --> 01:06:43,219
microbes in the soil no need to spray

1395
01:06:41,119 --> 01:06:46,220
silver on your plants let's just beyond

1396
01:06:43,219 --> 01:06:47,899
yeah I don't think so yeah but this

1397
01:06:46,219 --> 01:06:52,009
wasn't that this was something totally

1398
01:06:47,900 --> 01:06:54,858
different this was in taking

1399
01:06:52,010 --> 01:06:56,780
cannabinoids and then putting them

1400
01:06:54,858 --> 01:07:02,840
together after you've grown the plant

1401
01:06:56,780 --> 01:07:05,240
after you've extracted it there's all

1402
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:07,130
kinds of people doing nano and all kinds

1403
01:07:05,239 --> 01:07:09,199
of different sort of formulations to

1404
01:07:07,130 --> 01:07:12,470
there is you know put these very

1405
01:07:09,199 --> 01:07:15,079
hydrophobic molecules into you know

1406
01:07:12,469 --> 01:07:18,108
water and water based formulations so

1407
01:07:15,079 --> 01:07:19,608
you know there's again just many

1408
01:07:18,108 --> 01:07:22,400
different ways of doing that

1409
01:07:19,608 --> 01:07:24,500
you know 18 mention less it in I mean

1410
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:27,230
less attends one you know sort of

1411
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:29,420
naturally occurring material that can be

1412
01:07:27,230 --> 01:07:48,019
used but there's any number of materials

1413
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:57,980
that can be used ultimately no no Sam

1414
01:07:48,019 --> 01:08:01,539
that was terrible you really can't you

1415
01:07:57,980 --> 01:08:05,119
really really can't help yourself

1416
01:08:01,539 --> 01:08:09,320
wash here I will be honest it probably

1417
01:08:05,119 --> 01:08:13,250
took me like two or three years to get

1418
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:17,420
into the frequency to to not miss Sam's

1419
01:08:13,250 --> 01:08:20,810
jokes because they would often go over

1420
01:08:17,420 --> 01:08:22,730
my head or under my feet or beside by I

1421
01:08:20,810 --> 01:08:24,830
was just like but then when I got it I

1422
01:08:22,729 --> 01:08:28,939
was like man this guy has like the

1423
01:08:24,829 --> 01:08:32,659
craziest driest 60 take dry humor and

1424
01:08:28,939 --> 01:08:35,409
then take it to a desert no look past

1425
01:08:32,659 --> 01:08:35,409
the Oasis

1426
01:08:36,029 --> 01:08:45,849
yeah for a year yeah exactly I was gonna

1427
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:51,369
say that as well you got to turn it into

1428
01:08:45,850 --> 01:08:54,160
the 99.9 percent dry humor that's

1429
01:08:51,369 --> 01:09:05,229
concentrated dry humor and then

1430
01:08:54,159 --> 01:09:09,460
hydrogenated I've got some a little bit

1431
01:09:05,229 --> 01:09:14,399
of Rods in here that has a lot of smelly

1432
01:09:09,460 --> 01:09:17,380
I like it without having to hear that

1433
01:09:14,399 --> 01:09:21,489
damn I got some nice full melt rice if

1434

01:09:54,130 --> 01:10:09,640
just playing our parts in a movie it's

1444
01:09:56,770 --> 01:10:11,040
just so so insane wrote the script oh my

1445

01:10:17,890 --> 01:10:21,640
conference so I'm ready to have that

1449
01:10:19,210 --> 01:10:30,489
conversation oh by the way Sam I saw

1450
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:31,230
Jase Calloway said to say hello yeah go

1451

so in California we've just you know

1453
01:10:35,770 --> 01:10:41,530
we've got this cannabis set of laws with

1454
01:10:39,250 --> 01:10:44,760
insane kinds of regulations for every

1455
01:10:41,529 --> 01:10:47,238
sort of activity in the cannabis work

1456
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:49,969
but then we also have this

1457
01:10:47,238 --> 01:10:52,788
separate industry called him and

1458
01:10:49,969 --> 01:10:54,529
basically they're using similar plants

1459
01:10:52,788 --> 01:10:55,809
and yeah there's the whole registry

1460
01:10:54,529 --> 01:10:59,479
thing that we were discussing earlier

1461
01:10:55,809 --> 01:11:02,480
but in trying to learn how this is going

1462
01:10:59,479 --> 01:11:04,248
to work on the in the real world one of

1463
01:11:02,479 --> 01:11:07,089
the things that I've realized has become

1464
01:11:04,248 --> 01:11:09,948
really important is that cannabis in

1465
01:11:07,090 --> 01:11:13,578
California is regulated under the

1466
01:11:09,948 --> 01:11:18,049
business and Professions Code where as

1467
01:11:13,578 --> 01:11:20,719
him is in the food and agricultural code

1468
01:11:18,050 --> 01:11:23,989
and in the food and agricultural code

1469
01:11:20,719 --> 01:11:26,260
cannabis as hemp enjoys all the

1470
01:11:23,988 --> 01:11:29,748
protections of the right to farm act

1471
01:11:26,260 --> 01:11:32,239
which carries all kinds of weight in

1472
01:11:29,748 --> 01:11:37,158
California for agriculture and whatnot

1473
01:11:32,238 --> 01:11:39,319
and meantime yeah there's all kinds of

1474
01:11:37,158 --> 01:11:43,219
questions that come into play for a

1475
01:11:39,319 --> 01:11:46,248
person like for myself if I have six

1476
01:11:43,219 --> 01:11:50,420
personal use plants growing on my

1477
01:11:46,248 --> 01:11:53,359
property if they happen to be hemp type

1478
01:11:50,420 --> 01:11:55,519
plants I'm actually breaking the law if

1479
01:11:53,359 --> 01:11:57,679
they're high THC plants that don't have

1480
01:11:55,519 --> 01:12:00,940
that it that they have more than three

1481
01:11:57,679 --> 01:12:04,840
tenths of a percent THC then they are

1482
01:12:00,939 --> 01:12:07,638
cannabis and I even allowed to grow them

1483
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:09,619
no that's way it is in California that's

1484
01:12:07,639 --> 01:12:20,029
what I'm saying you have to grow at

1485
01:12:09,618 --> 01:12:21,768
least 1/10 of an acre of him I'm just

1486
01:12:20,029 --> 01:12:25,389
talking about the California food and AG

1487
01:12:21,769 --> 01:12:28,998
in him says you have to grow at least

1488
01:12:25,389 --> 01:12:30,529
1/10 of an acre whereas if it's if

1489
01:12:28,998 --> 01:12:32,988
they're cannabis plants if I call them

1490
01:12:30,529 --> 01:12:36,439
cannabis plants I can have 6 on my

1491
01:12:32,988 --> 01:12:37,578
property no question I have to be

1492
01:12:36,439 --> 01:12:41,779
indoors but that's a whole other

1493
01:12:37,578 --> 01:12:44,509
conversation it's it's fascinating to me

1494
01:12:41,779 --> 01:12:47,359
that in law we're trying to take the

1495
01:12:44,510 --> 01:12:51,769
cannabis plant and say some of them are

1496
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:53,538
gonna be AG products commodities and and

1497
01:12:51,769 --> 01:12:55,159
meantime there's the whole question of

1498
01:12:53,538 --> 01:12:58,538
most of the people in California who are

1499
01:12:55,158 --> 01:13:00,888
doing CBD are doing hemp want to do CBD

1500
01:12:58,538 --> 01:13:04,639
but meantime the

1501
01:13:00,889 --> 01:13:08,420
the folks who regulate cannabis the BCC

1502
01:13:04,639 --> 01:13:10,670
have said you can't sell CBD as hemp to

1503
01:13:08,420 --> 01:13:13,819
any human you can't sell it in Canada

1504
01:13:10,670 --> 01:13:15,618
California as a cannabis product it has

1505
01:13:13,819 --> 01:13:17,448
to go through a dispensary so it has to

1506
01:13:15,618 --> 01:13:20,329
go through the track and trace and it's

1507
01:13:17,448 --> 01:13:23,710
to me it's just an example of regulation

1508
01:13:20,329 --> 01:13:25,939
gone awry it's release it's it's

1509
01:13:23,710 --> 01:13:29,239
nonsensical if you will it's almost

1510
01:13:25,939 --> 01:13:31,069
Alice in Wonderland kind of stuff that's

1511
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:34,189
all I got for the moment I'm fascinated

1512
01:13:31,069 --> 01:13:37,399
to hear any other points of view about

1513
01:13:34,189 --> 01:13:40,129
this but yeah the crux of it is in

1514
01:13:37,399 --> 01:13:42,379
California is an Ag product and all the

1515
01:13:40,130 --> 01:13:45,020
rest of cannabis is a business and

1516
01:13:42,380 --> 01:13:47,810
Professions Code side a thing all kinds

1517
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:50,090
of regulations ridiculous for sure

1518
01:13:47,810 --> 01:14:02,360
welcome to the dragonfly Earth Medicine

1519
01:13:50,090 --> 01:14:04,130
in the room welcome you you all had

1520
01:14:02,359 --> 01:14:08,210
talked a little bit about the Canadian

1521
01:14:04,130 --> 01:14:10,460
have codes and stuff so I think that you

1522
01:14:08,210 --> 01:14:14,210
know that hemp has always been part of

1523
01:14:10,460 --> 01:14:16,760
like a bigger AG situation with with the

1524
01:14:14,210 --> 01:14:18,948
seeds and the fiber and now it's moving

1525
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:22,520
into a medicinal and now you know you

1526
01:14:18,948 --> 01:14:25,908
have farms that are out west that are

1527
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:27,889
mostly concerned on on CBD strains and

1528
01:14:25,908 --> 01:14:29,960
then you have hemp farms out in the

1529
01:14:27,889 --> 01:14:32,690
prairies like Manitoba where where

1530
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:35,029
Marcus was where they're still totally

1531
01:14:32,689 --> 01:14:36,948
focused on fiber and seeds so really I

1532
01:14:35,029 --> 01:14:39,710
don't think the government has the

1533
01:14:36,948 --> 01:14:42,198
capability of of getting their systems

1534
01:14:39,710 --> 01:14:44,448
up-to-date as fast as the plant is

1535
01:14:42,198 --> 01:14:46,809
changing and as fast as all the farmers

1536
01:14:44,448 --> 01:14:49,009
are making discoveries

1537
01:14:46,810 --> 01:14:51,199
yeah we're making all these discoveries

1538
01:14:49,010 --> 01:14:52,880
along with you know these amazing

1539
01:14:51,198 --> 01:14:55,549
scientists and laboratories that were

1540
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:57,139
working with and and the laws they they

1541
01:14:55,550 --> 01:14:59,119
just heard they're like a stagnant

1542
01:14:57,139 --> 01:15:02,118
creature that can't keep up with it so

1543
01:14:59,118 --> 01:15:04,429
it's almost really difficult to manage

1544
01:15:02,118 --> 01:15:06,889
that we're bummed out about it at embark

1545
01:15:04,429 --> 01:15:09,170
because we want hemp farmers to be able

1546
01:15:06,889 --> 01:15:11,510
to grow high cannabinoid content

1547
01:15:09,170 --> 01:15:14,140
cultivars and because we're looking at

1548
01:15:11,510 --> 01:15:17,890
processing ten plus thousand

1549
01:15:14,140 --> 01:15:19,180
spurred a we need we need large numbers

1550
01:15:17,890 --> 01:15:22,450
like we're not just gonna be able to

1551
01:15:19,180 --> 01:15:24,369
toll process for for LPS we're more

1552
01:15:22,449 --> 01:15:26,260
interested in getting material from

1553
01:15:24,369 --> 01:15:28,930
either greenhouse growers relationships

1554
01:15:26,260 --> 01:15:30,460
that we make ourselves or you know being

1555
01:15:28,930 --> 01:15:32,770
able to get it out of country and

1556
01:15:30,460 --> 01:15:35,619
producing crude oil and shipping it in

1557
01:15:32,770 --> 01:15:37,450
but ideally getting getting them from

1558
01:15:35,619 --> 01:15:39,369
Canadian farmers that are able to

1559
01:15:37,449 --> 01:15:40,929
understand because this is another thing

1560
01:15:39,369 --> 01:15:43,239
that a lot of Canadian farmers don't

1561
01:15:40,930 --> 01:15:45,100
understand right now is that when you're

1562
01:15:43,239 --> 01:15:47,559
gonna grow for cannabinoid content

1563
01:15:45,100 --> 01:15:49,539
you're not going to grow for seat and

1564
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:51,820
most of them right now think that this

1565
01:15:49,539 --> 01:15:54,789
is this cannabinoid thing CBD in

1566
01:15:51,819 --> 01:15:57,340
particular is an added value that they

1567
01:15:54,789 --> 01:16:00,189
can just process their crops and I

1568
01:15:57,340 --> 01:16:04,750
personally like it's it's difficult to

1569
01:16:00,189 --> 01:16:08,289
to process hemp that's like 2 and 1

1570
01:16:04,750 --> 01:16:10,659
percent returns it's just not you when

1571
01:16:08,289 --> 01:16:12,430
you have the ability to process so much

1572
01:16:10,659 --> 01:16:14,019
you're better off processing a

1573
01:16:12,430 --> 01:16:18,810
cannabinoid content that's you know

1574
01:16:14,020 --> 01:16:22,120
above 8% and ideally above 20% well yeah

1575
01:16:18,810 --> 01:16:24,400
our brother here in the Eugene area just

1576
01:16:22,119 --> 01:16:27,010
grew a strain called the lifter this

1577
01:16:24,399 --> 01:16:30,069
year and got 23.5%

1578
01:16:27,010 --> 01:16:32,320
on his outdoor lifter and he's really

1579
01:16:30,069 --> 01:16:34,659
really stoked now he's that the lab said

1580
01:16:32,319 --> 01:16:36,759
it was the highest of the season so

1581
01:16:34,659 --> 01:16:38,979
there there's some real it's a beautiful

1582
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:41,560
flower we have a jar but right here and

1583
01:16:38,979 --> 01:16:43,899
it's got an incredible flavor highest of

1584
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:46,570
the season I picture there's some huge

1585
01:16:43,899 --> 01:16:49,389
heart celebration and he gets to sit in

1586
01:16:46,569 --> 01:16:52,599
this hand-carved chair above everyone

1587
01:16:49,390 --> 01:16:56,490
house and carried through the a chair

1588
01:16:52,600 --> 01:17:01,680
made of hemp stalks of course of course

1589
01:16:56,489 --> 01:17:01,679
you have one the highest of the year

1590
01:17:02,460 --> 01:17:09,699
there's no but it does have a really

1591
01:17:06,939 --> 01:17:12,489
amazing wide variety of terpenes as well

1592
01:17:09,699 --> 01:17:16,059
and it's a hybrid of the special sauce

1593
01:17:12,489 --> 01:17:20,260
from last year from Crawford Brothers so

1594
01:17:16,060 --> 01:17:22,030
yeah it's good a lot of a lot of new

1595
01:17:20,260 --> 01:17:23,230
strains happening right now so it's

1596
01:17:22,029 --> 01:17:25,929
really interesting to see how they

1597
01:17:23,229 --> 01:17:27,509
turned out this year it's funny because

1598
01:17:25,930 --> 01:17:29,519
one of my videos went viral

1599
01:17:27,510 --> 01:17:31,349
recently on YouTube it's my video of

1600
01:17:29,519 --> 01:17:33,719
where I press half a pound of where's my

1601
01:17:31,349 --> 01:17:36,840
bike from karma genetics and I make 60

1602
01:17:33,719 --> 01:17:38,038
grams of rosin and it's just gone viral

1603
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:40,110
it's got like three or four hundred

1604
01:17:38,038 --> 01:17:43,288
thousand views in the last like couple

1605
01:17:40,109 --> 01:17:47,279
of days it's well over a million views

1606
01:17:43,288 --> 01:17:50,130
now like 1.4 or something but it's it's

1607
01:17:47,279 --> 01:17:52,670
an incredible to see people watch a

1608
01:17:50,130 --> 01:17:57,269
video where a plant can return

1609
01:17:52,670 --> 01:18:00,210
twenty-nine percent dry weight of oil to

1610
01:17:57,269 --> 01:18:03,090
bud and have people after person after

1611
01:18:00,210 --> 01:18:06,269
person after person say that bud was

1612
01:18:03,090 --> 01:18:07,949
bunk that was mid grade herb because

1613
01:18:06,269 --> 01:18:11,550
where's my bike doesn't look all shiny

1614
01:18:07,948 --> 01:18:13,439
in LA and fake it really it really looks

1615
01:18:11,550 --> 01:18:15,389
almost like an outdoor even when grown

1616
01:18:13,439 --> 01:18:17,009
indoor it looks even if your what you

1617
01:18:15,389 --> 01:18:19,590
trim it well it just kind of looks a

1618
01:18:17,010 --> 01:18:21,780
little not that great of a herb but it's

1619
01:18:19,590 --> 01:18:25,170
truly a perfect example of herb that you

1620
01:18:21,779 --> 01:18:27,149
cannot judge by its cover because the

1621
01:18:25,170 --> 01:18:29,578
content of cannabinoid and terpenes that

1622
01:18:27,149 --> 01:18:31,710
it produces that are actually on point

1623
01:18:29,578 --> 01:18:35,340
and worth hitting like they're strong

1624
01:18:31,710 --> 01:18:39,559
and they're clear and they're tasty yeah

1625
01:18:35,340 --> 01:18:42,210
it's it's kind of a winning combination

1626
01:18:39,559 --> 01:18:48,420
what's that Sam you're a little far away

1627
01:18:42,210 --> 01:18:51,989
you're a little far from your mic oh it

1628
01:18:48,420 --> 01:18:56,630
sounded I hear you but you cut out a

1629
01:18:51,988 --> 01:19:00,569
little bit go ahead

1630
01:18:56,630 --> 01:19:03,440
no when I was asking me was did you put

1631
01:19:00,569 --> 01:19:06,210
it in and kind of the desiccator or

1632
01:19:03,439 --> 01:19:16,069
other there anything to try and dry it

1633
01:19:06,210 --> 01:19:19,198
out ah no I did not but it definitely

1634
01:19:16,069 --> 01:19:21,840
didn't change much that first batch had

1635
01:19:19,198 --> 01:19:24,178
stayed very consistent and sort of pull

1636
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:26,940
and snappy I I did run some recently

1637
01:19:24,179 --> 01:19:29,670
that buttered out immediately and we we

1638
01:19:26,939 --> 01:19:32,009
weighed it buttered out it so I've got I

1639
01:19:29,670 --> 01:19:36,929
made about 400 grams of it recently a

1640
01:19:32,010 --> 01:19:38,550
big [ __ ] of there's my bike rosin just

1641
01:19:36,929 --> 01:19:40,690
putting it through the the pure pressure

1642
01:19:38,550 --> 01:19:44,320
that thing is like a workhorse

1643
01:19:40,689 --> 01:19:46,869
I actually have a few bags left here

1644
01:19:44,319 --> 01:19:51,340
still I think oh yeah they're over here

1645
01:19:46,869 --> 01:19:52,960
a few that I didn't process yet I've got

1646
01:19:51,340 --> 01:19:56,529
them in with the Babita so they don't

1647
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:58,899
dry out but I've got about ten bags in

1648
01:19:56,529 --> 01:20:01,659
here each with 35 grams there their

1649
01:19:58,899 --> 01:20:04,750
heart is a rock this batch was the first

1650
01:20:01,659 --> 01:20:10,000
batch whole does it smell oh my god it

1651
01:20:04,750 --> 01:20:13,180
was the first batch that I blew bags

1652
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:16,630
with earth I've never had that is so

1653
01:20:13,180 --> 01:20:19,119
hard that it glows the bag I've had hash

1654
01:20:16,630 --> 01:20:22,539
do it so with these particular batches I

1655
01:20:19,119 --> 01:20:25,180
had to close the plates let it sit on

1656
01:20:22,539 --> 01:20:28,180
the herb at about 20 psi for a solid

1657
01:20:25,180 --> 01:20:31,119
thirty Seconds to a minute and basically

1658
01:20:28,180 --> 01:20:33,550
wait until it just started juicing and

1659
01:20:31,119 --> 01:20:36,460
then I could apply a higher you know amp

1660
01:20:33,550 --> 01:20:39,159
up the the PSI on the on the toggle

1661
01:20:36,460 --> 01:20:41,140
switch but if I came down the way I

1662
01:20:39,159 --> 01:20:43,779
pressed my last batch of where's my bike

1663
01:20:41,140 --> 01:20:45,910
I just came down with full psi it would

1664
01:20:43,779 --> 01:20:51,250
squish it and I'd get a 9 to 10 gram

1665
01:20:45,909 --> 01:20:53,920
return each time never mind in a sayers

1666
01:20:51,250 --> 01:20:57,189
if you pay any attention to them drag

1667
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:59,409
you down to the mud with them ah the

1668
01:20:57,189 --> 01:21:01,479
naysayers it's true why am I so like

1669
01:20:59,409 --> 01:21:03,579
obsessed with them with replying to the

1670
01:21:01,479 --> 01:21:05,379
naysayers I find I get caught up in it

1671
01:21:03,579 --> 01:21:07,090
and then I'm like I'm only gonna reply

1672
01:21:05,380 --> 01:21:09,279
to positive comments people that are

1673
01:21:07,090 --> 01:21:11,529
asking you know information like what

1674
01:21:09,279 --> 01:21:13,479
songs on the video or they actually want

1675
01:21:11,529 --> 01:21:16,448
to learn something I'm answering them

1676
01:21:13,479 --> 01:21:18,429
first not the guys that's that are

1677
01:21:16,448 --> 01:21:20,198
slamming well because you're a truth

1678
01:21:18,430 --> 01:21:22,000
seer and you can see through it so you

1679
01:21:20,198 --> 01:21:24,189
know it's part of the realities of what

1680
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:26,319
we face when you're pioneering and

1681
01:21:24,189 --> 01:21:27,789
you're creating your own trail as you

1682
01:21:26,319 --> 01:21:30,099
know as interest says you know just

1683
01:21:27,789 --> 01:21:33,579
carry on do your own thing don't don't

1684
01:21:30,100 --> 01:21:35,079
if everybody listened on this panel to

1685
01:21:33,579 --> 01:21:37,390
what everybody else thinks

1686
01:21:35,079 --> 01:21:40,779
there would be no panel none of us would

1687
01:21:37,390 --> 01:21:43,480
be here so we've all Buck roads within

1688
01:21:40,779 --> 01:21:45,759
reality along the way to where we're

1689
01:21:43,479 --> 01:21:48,099
like no you're wrong we can make a

1690
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:50,980
better path so we've all established

1691
01:21:48,100 --> 01:21:51,700
that many much in many thanks to that

1692
01:21:50,979 --> 01:21:53,979
man

1693
01:21:51,699 --> 01:21:56,529
therefore establishing a lot of the

1694
01:21:53,979 --> 01:21:58,329
reality that we know and Andrea always

1695
01:21:56,529 --> 01:22:00,039
thanked me for your medicine because

1696
01:21:58,329 --> 01:22:02,170
they still use it daily and your

1697
01:22:00,039 --> 01:22:05,619
creation has changed my life for the

1698
01:22:02,170 --> 01:22:09,420
better so I think you both well I bet

1699
01:22:05,619 --> 01:22:12,159
dr. calzone does he gave me the advice

1700
01:22:09,420 --> 01:22:14,800
to get it certified in a bunch of

1701
01:22:12,159 --> 01:22:21,099
different ways way back when really

1702
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:24,190
buying into it that that well now our

1703
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:27,430
equipment is fully certified under those

1704
01:22:24,189 --> 01:22:29,889
guidelines in every state in the country

1705
01:22:27,430 --> 01:22:32,170
and in every country actually right

1706
01:22:29,890 --> 01:22:34,360
around the world and it's because I

1707
01:22:32,170 --> 01:22:38,409
finally started listening to his advice

1708
01:22:34,359 --> 01:22:41,109
about how to go about doing that so the

1709
01:22:38,409 --> 01:22:43,300
whole thing the all the stuff that's

1710
01:22:41,109 --> 01:22:45,429
happening now by the way there's we have

1711
01:22:43,300 --> 01:22:49,570
two installed and they're being used and

1712
01:22:45,430 --> 01:22:54,010
people that are using sanely happy with

1713
01:22:49,569 --> 01:22:58,329
them and they're using it more than one

1714
01:22:54,010 --> 01:23:01,539
thing one of the users of it is actually

1715
01:22:58,329 --> 01:23:04,590
spending a few days a week doing hemp

1716
01:23:01,539 --> 01:23:07,810
and then a couple days a week doing

1717
01:23:04,590 --> 01:23:10,989
other stuff different fragrance stuff

1718
01:23:07,810 --> 01:23:13,870
he's doing a lot of speeds and he just

1719
01:23:10,989 --> 01:23:16,869
recently did a number of seeds which are

1720
01:23:13,869 --> 01:23:20,710
very interesting and it should prove to

1721
01:23:16,869 --> 01:23:22,689
be quite the thing and so now we're also

1722
01:23:20,710 --> 01:23:25,029
going to come out with the small one

1723
01:23:22,689 --> 01:23:27,429
I've got the prototype getting ready to

1724
01:23:25,029 --> 01:23:31,899
come and way back when in the beginning

1725
01:23:27,430 --> 01:23:34,000
I promised mark one of the small ones he

1726
01:23:31,899 --> 01:23:37,929
used for research I haven't forgotten

1727
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:41,859
that just that we don't have one exactly

1728
01:23:37,930 --> 01:23:44,770
ready it just gave me the first mock-up

1729
01:23:41,859 --> 01:23:46,689
of it wanting to know if I wanted

1730
01:23:44,770 --> 01:23:49,870
anything changed on it and I submitted

1731
01:23:46,689 --> 01:23:54,399
the drawings to psi psi said it's a go

1732
01:23:49,869 --> 01:23:56,920
and so well we're gonna start producing

1733
01:23:54,399 --> 01:23:59,439
those ones going to go to Marcus one's

1734
01:23:56,920 --> 01:24:04,060
going to go to mark one's going to go to

1735
01:23:59,439 --> 01:24:05,259
wait and that whole scenario there

1736
01:24:04,060 --> 01:24:07,179
though that's what's going to

1737
01:24:05,260 --> 01:24:11,170
to the first three of those small ones

1738
01:24:07,179 --> 01:24:15,519
and we're also come out with a double

1739
01:24:11,170 --> 01:24:17,559
size 1 and a triple size one but triple

1740
01:24:15,519 --> 01:24:21,610
size it

1741
01:24:17,559 --> 01:24:28,208
McDonagh oops one go for a quad they're

1742
01:24:21,609 --> 01:24:30,908
all certified 200 centigrade 2 plus 224

1743
01:24:28,208 --> 01:24:33,309
Fahrenheit that's a good range she got

1744
01:24:30,908 --> 01:24:34,839
to admit that should be able to allow

1745
01:24:33,309 --> 01:24:37,479
you to get whatever kind of extraction

1746
01:24:34,840 --> 01:24:40,420
you're seeking but anyway it's been a

1747
01:24:37,479 --> 01:24:45,610
long drawn-out trail and once again I

1748
01:24:40,420 --> 01:24:46,979
just say thanks oh it's about time I did

1749
01:24:45,609 --> 01:24:49,389
something useful

1750
01:24:46,979 --> 01:24:58,539
what do you mean you're hydrogenating

1751
01:24:49,389 --> 01:25:00,609
[ __ ] like crazy bro hydrogenation thing

1752
01:24:58,538 --> 01:25:07,059
I think it's a very interesting path

1753
01:25:00,609 --> 01:25:10,299
myself um something's gonna come out

1754
01:25:07,059 --> 01:25:13,708
from me this year one of them I want to

1755
01:25:10,300 --> 01:25:16,650
do right here on the show with you I

1756
01:25:13,708 --> 01:25:20,408
want you to premiere it and show it

1757
01:25:16,649 --> 01:25:24,339
we'll do it I'm always down you've been

1758
01:25:20,408 --> 01:25:27,848
very supportive and ever since I met you

1759
01:25:24,340 --> 01:25:31,479
which is way the [ __ ] back yeah it

1760
01:25:27,849 --> 01:25:33,519
really was and actually if we would have

1761
01:25:31,479 --> 01:25:35,920
gotten a little more together things

1762
01:25:33,519 --> 01:25:38,559
then instead of just letting everything

1763
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:42,190
go by the wayside you and I probably be

1764
01:25:38,559 --> 01:25:44,279
multimillionaires right now they'd stop

1765
01:25:42,189 --> 01:25:49,658
what we missed

1766
01:25:44,279 --> 01:25:51,939
so really well it would be nice to pay

1767
01:25:49,658 --> 01:25:55,469
for plane tickets mostly but I could do

1768
01:25:51,939 --> 01:25:57,969
with with or without I'm fine I'm good I

1769
01:25:55,469 --> 01:26:01,300
mostly just want at this point in time I

1770
01:25:57,969 --> 01:26:09,130
won't lie to be healthy that's up that's

1771
01:26:01,300 --> 01:26:14,130
like top notch number uno I hate people

1772
01:26:09,130 --> 01:26:14,130
I know who came very wealthy you came

1773
01:26:14,969 --> 01:26:18,789
yeah it's true it's true I could I could

1774
01:26:18,219 --> 01:26:21,730
I can

1775
01:26:18,789 --> 01:26:24,310
sail along the lines although I do know

1776
01:26:21,729 --> 01:26:25,509
some great great people that that have

1777
01:26:24,310 --> 01:26:30,430
been very successful

1778
01:26:25,510 --> 01:26:34,750
hey welcome Daniel you got a mic there

1779
01:26:30,430 --> 01:26:38,260
Daniel can you hear me welcome

1780
01:26:34,750 --> 01:26:43,479
that's Daniel from Whistler technologies

1781
01:26:38,260 --> 01:26:49,329
and whistler medical up in pen B yes

1782
01:26:43,479 --> 01:26:50,709
Daniel hey he's muted he's muted I don't

1783
01:26:49,329 --> 01:26:53,289
know why he's muted but he'll figure

1784
01:26:50,710 --> 01:26:59,500
it's it's you know there we go

1785
01:26:53,289 --> 01:27:00,539
there it is welcome dude thank you we

1786
01:26:59,500 --> 01:27:03,119
can hear you

1787
01:27:00,539 --> 01:27:07,029
so we were talking earlier about

1788
01:27:03,119 --> 01:27:09,539
microbials and water hash and ever the

1789
01:27:07,029 --> 01:27:13,029
problem down in California actually Wade

1790
01:27:09,539 --> 01:27:15,819
the friendly looking bearded fellow in

1791
01:27:13,029 --> 01:27:18,219
the corner with the green hat he was he

1792
01:27:15,819 --> 01:27:20,049
was talking about it and I was I wasn't

1793
01:27:18,220 --> 01:27:21,400
man I wish Daniel was in here right now

1794
01:27:20,050 --> 01:27:23,440
we could be talking a little bit about

1795
01:27:21,399 --> 01:27:25,689
what we're doing at whistle technologies

1796
01:27:23,439 --> 01:27:28,539
and trying to sort of take into account

1797
01:27:25,689 --> 01:27:33,460
those those infamous microbials that

1798
01:27:28,539 --> 01:27:35,769
love to fail water hashes yeah we we've

1799
01:27:33,460 --> 01:27:39,250
been doing some testing with Whistler

1800
01:27:35,770 --> 01:27:40,750
medical and we've seen pretty good micro

1801
01:27:39,250 --> 01:27:42,880
results for the hash we haven't seen any

1802
01:27:40,750 --> 01:27:46,810
hash fail yet we've even seen half past

1803
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:50,289
that the dry the bud from the same lot

1804
01:27:46,810 --> 01:27:53,460
had a higher microbial count it seems

1805
01:27:50,289 --> 01:27:55,689
the freeze drying did help a lot though

1806
01:27:53,460 --> 01:27:57,699
yeah we were talking about that that

1807
01:27:55,689 --> 01:28:00,159
freeze drying is gonna be pretty pretty

1808
01:27:57,699 --> 01:28:03,369
essential to dividing that water out as

1809
01:28:00,159 --> 01:28:05,619
quick as possible we make the ice with

1810
01:28:03,369 --> 01:28:08,050
RO water and cleaning your ice machine

1811
01:28:05,619 --> 01:28:10,539
regularly because even with the RO water

1812
01:28:08,050 --> 01:28:13,090
you get this like pink slime that builds

1813
01:28:10,539 --> 01:28:15,939
up in there so cleaning out all your

1814
01:28:13,090 --> 01:28:18,010
water at the ice equipment helps a lot

1815
01:28:15,939 --> 01:28:20,199
the only time we used commercially

1816
01:28:18,010 --> 01:28:23,440
available ice we failed micro like

1817
01:28:20,199 --> 01:28:25,929
terribly that's that's saying a lot

1818
01:28:23,439 --> 01:28:29,859
right there isn't it yeah the pink

1819
01:28:25,930 --> 01:28:32,369
that's in that pink slime is a is iron

1820
01:28:29,859 --> 01:28:35,460
from the hardness of your water

1821
01:28:32,369 --> 01:28:37,349
so that pink is usually like we see it

1822
01:28:35,460 --> 01:28:39,899
every once a while in our ice tray when

1823
01:28:37,350 --> 01:28:44,130
we clean it out to that whole apparatus

1824
01:28:39,899 --> 01:28:48,119
and there develops what's I I guess it's

1825
01:28:44,130 --> 01:28:52,920
not a living biome but it's just what's

1826
01:28:48,119 --> 01:28:57,420
called a biofilm right so biofilm into

1827
01:28:52,920 --> 01:29:00,119
you know fowl commercial ice makers so

1828
01:28:57,420 --> 01:29:04,289
it's definitely worth you know looking

1829
01:29:00,119 --> 01:29:06,750
into how you can clean those out yeah

1830
01:29:04,289 --> 01:29:08,310
you definitely gonna cut control and

1831
01:29:06,750 --> 01:29:13,380
condition your water and your ice

1832
01:29:08,310 --> 01:29:15,240
there's I'd like no get it yeah yeah my

1833
01:29:13,380 --> 01:29:18,060
friend up in Pemberton has made amazing

1834
01:29:15,239 --> 01:29:20,189
bubble for years going up to black tusk

1835
01:29:18,060 --> 01:29:23,250
and collecting ice up there and in the

1836
01:29:20,189 --> 01:29:25,529
snow I was thinking the other day that

1837
01:29:23,250 --> 01:29:27,449
uh all the out bull and Lillooet there

1838
01:29:25,529 --> 01:29:29,159
should be a cold storage facility that's

1839
01:29:27,449 --> 01:29:30,840
just like up in the alpine so in

1840
01:29:29,159 --> 01:29:32,220
November hits you can just like bring it

1841
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:34,020
up to a warehouse that doesn't actually

1842
01:29:32,220 --> 01:29:39,960
have cooling and then process into hash

1843
01:29:34,020 --> 01:29:42,060
up there be awesome need to do at the

1844
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:44,189
ski Hut's that aren't working out ski

1845
01:29:42,060 --> 01:29:47,430
lodges just turn them into hash lodges

1846
01:29:44,189 --> 01:29:49,589
and turn on listen I know some good hash

1847
01:29:47,430 --> 01:29:52,460
or have already call into the hash Lodge

1848
01:29:49,590 --> 01:29:54,360
that have really amazing micro-hydro

1849
01:29:52,460 --> 01:29:55,829
situations on them because they're way

1850
01:29:54,359 --> 01:29:57,389
up in the mountains next to a giant

1851
01:29:55,829 --> 01:29:59,010
Crete so they're making all their own

1852
01:29:57,390 --> 01:29:59,579
electricity and stuff to you that would

1853
01:29:59,010 --> 01:30:01,530
be amazing

1854
01:29:59,579 --> 01:30:06,210
dude I'm picturing a really cool

1855
01:30:01,529 --> 01:30:09,539
Whistler technologies sort of commercial

1856
01:30:06,210 --> 01:30:11,970
or you know video brochure you know

1857
01:30:09,539 --> 01:30:14,989
whipping it up in that little cabin on

1858
01:30:11,970 --> 01:30:18,840
the top of the mountain I'll be so sick

1859
01:30:14,989 --> 01:30:29,969
you know there is it's a way without

1860
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:31,770
water yes yes we know John we know a lot

1861
01:30:29,970 --> 01:30:34,320
of the water problems if you don't use

1862
01:30:31,770 --> 01:30:37,590
water for sure but when you're focused

1863
01:30:34,319 --> 01:30:39,569
on using water it's it definitely makes

1864
01:30:37,590 --> 01:30:41,970
a very good good product there's no

1865
01:30:39,569 --> 01:30:43,829
denying that bubble hash is not gonna go

1866
01:30:41,970 --> 01:30:45,680
away anytime soon there's always gonna

1867
01:30:43,829 --> 01:30:48,430
be new ways that come out that are

1868
01:30:45,680 --> 01:30:51,230
that are exceptional and we'll just

1869
01:30:48,430 --> 01:30:54,710
we'll we'll adapt along with them for

1870
01:30:51,229 --> 01:30:56,659
the last 20 years it's been its it's had

1871
01:30:54,710 --> 01:31:00,489
its place it's now I don't I don't feel

1872
01:30:56,659 --> 01:31:03,170
that it's going away I love bubble hash

1873
01:31:00,489 --> 01:31:06,979
when I was at the cup last year a bunch

1874
01:31:03,170 --> 01:31:10,250
of different be hurt me on to their

1875
01:31:06,979 --> 01:31:12,709
bubble hash I still have stashes of some

1876
01:31:10,250 --> 01:31:15,439
of it because I meet her and out to

1877
01:31:12,710 --> 01:31:18,079
myself very sparingly but it's such a

1878
01:31:15,439 --> 01:31:21,859
nice high I think there's room for every

1879
01:31:18,079 --> 01:31:25,279
kind of way of deriving the natural

1880
01:31:21,859 --> 01:31:28,099
products it's in the plant playing a lot

1881
01:31:25,279 --> 01:31:30,949
people are gonna find you eight methods

1882
01:31:28,100 --> 01:31:31,820
and ways of seeing and understanding how

1883
01:31:30,949 --> 01:31:35,929
it all works

1884
01:31:31,819 --> 01:31:38,929
I know I made my first extraction my

1885
01:31:35,930 --> 01:31:43,070
first gas extraction in 1970 and that

1886
01:31:38,930 --> 01:31:47,150
was I first saw thca crystals and it was

1887
01:31:43,069 --> 01:31:49,880
a it was literally by serendipity

1888
01:31:47,149 --> 01:31:53,329
because when I made that gas extraction

1889
01:31:49,880 --> 01:31:55,670
I left gas in the oil in a jar and when

1890
01:31:53,329 --> 01:32:00,109
I woke up in the morning I found the THC

1891
01:31:55,670 --> 01:32:03,710
a crystals so DHEA crystals

1892
01:32:00,109 --> 01:32:06,439
that's no new innovation I saw it

1893
01:32:03,710 --> 01:32:09,140
happened in front of my eyes in 1970 and

1894
01:32:06,439 --> 01:32:14,359
a bunch of other things because I was

1895
01:32:09,140 --> 01:32:19,190
researching a lot and in 1998 I left it

1896
01:32:14,359 --> 01:32:22,269
on the web I go so that other people

1897
01:32:19,189 --> 01:32:25,729
could experiment and find out

1898
01:32:22,270 --> 01:32:29,330
unfortunately a lot of people did the

1899
01:32:25,729 --> 01:32:32,359
wrong thing with it but there's a lot of

1900
01:32:29,329 --> 01:32:33,769
to be found out yet because I know a lot

1901
01:32:32,359 --> 01:32:39,699
of things and I don't hear anybody

1902
01:32:33,770 --> 01:32:44,750
talking about yet you know and because

1903
01:32:39,699 --> 01:32:48,170
it's number that method or that

1904
01:32:44,750 --> 01:32:51,649
particular derivative derivative of it

1905
01:32:48,170 --> 01:32:54,949
and so I still wait to see every day

1906
01:32:51,649 --> 01:32:57,170
there's so many creative people doing so

1907
01:32:54,949 --> 01:32:59,269
many creative things did I expect

1908
01:32:57,170 --> 01:33:02,269
everything that I've seen already

1909
01:32:59,269 --> 01:33:04,909
up till now to start just naturally

1910
01:33:02,269 --> 01:33:07,190
appearing in the biome of all the people

1911
01:33:04,908 --> 01:33:09,920
who live on earth because we all share

1912
01:33:07,189 --> 01:33:13,118
all these sensations and feelings all

1913
01:33:09,920 --> 01:33:16,460
the time and so I'm pretty sure that

1914
01:33:13,118 --> 01:33:20,058
some people are just going to get that

1915
01:33:16,460 --> 01:33:23,179
vibration and turn into it and these

1916
01:33:20,059 --> 01:33:25,279
things will change out the mark the more

1917
01:33:23,179 --> 01:33:27,349
people have access to like it's you know

1918
01:33:25,279 --> 01:33:29,359
if you're one of those lucky people in

1919
01:33:27,349 --> 01:33:31,460
life that you have had an enormous

1920
01:33:29,359 --> 01:33:33,408
amount of access to cannabis and to be

1921
01:33:31,460 --> 01:33:35,359
able to play around with it you can

1922
01:33:33,408 --> 01:33:37,759
discover things it's much harder to

1923
01:33:35,359 --> 01:33:41,089
discover things if you don't have an

1924
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:45,019
enormous access to cannabis of quality

1925
01:33:41,090 --> 01:33:48,469
cannabis I got started in Vietnam and I

1926
01:33:45,019 --> 01:33:50,690
was busy when you were in Vietnam you

1927
01:33:48,469 --> 01:33:53,239
were considered in the combat zone you

1928
01:33:50,689 --> 01:33:55,939
could send mail back to the USA with no

1929
01:33:53,238 --> 01:34:00,138
customs and no inspection so I sent my

1930
01:33:55,939 --> 01:34:01,939
mother 37 Sanyal refrigerators those

1931
01:34:00,139 --> 01:34:05,809
little coolers he is four drinks

1932
01:34:01,939 --> 01:34:07,158
full of Thai steak and blue lipstick and

1933
01:34:05,809 --> 01:34:09,800
stuff that I bought while I was in

1934
01:34:07,158 --> 01:34:11,268
Vietnam because well before I went to

1935
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:14,329
Vietnam my mom said don't smoke

1936
01:34:11,269 --> 01:34:17,269
marijuana and I said okay I won't but by

1937
01:34:14,328 --> 01:34:19,488
chance under fire somebody gave me some

1938
01:34:17,269 --> 01:34:19,789
when I smoked it and I was become me way

1939
01:34:19,488 --> 01:34:21,799
down

1940
01:34:19,788 --> 01:34:24,170
I said what's that and he said pot and

1941
01:34:21,800 --> 01:34:26,029
I'm like oh [ __ ] I froze mom well anyway

1942
01:34:24,170 --> 01:34:28,399
I said mom back 37 of these

1943
01:34:26,029 --> 01:34:30,859
refrigerators because I was afraid I

1944
01:34:28,399 --> 01:34:33,618
wouldn't be able to find pot back in the

1945
01:34:30,859 --> 01:34:37,130
States and I knew that they weren't

1946
01:34:33,618 --> 01:34:39,439
expecting it so I you know I had a lot

1947
01:34:37,130 --> 01:34:42,050
of it that was very good and I had it

1948
01:34:39,439 --> 01:34:43,759
for a long time I had all the seeds from

1949
01:34:42,050 --> 01:34:49,730
that in case you're getting ready to ask

1950
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:53,809
and I have a plethora of all that stuff

1951
01:34:49,729 --> 01:34:55,879
from that time because mostly out of

1952
01:34:53,809 --> 01:34:57,320
paranoia that I wouldn't be completely

1953
01:34:55,880 --> 01:34:59,449
get it back in the States

1954
01:34:57,319 --> 01:35:01,849
so I did have a lot of that and I did

1955
01:34:59,448 --> 01:35:06,138
experiment with it and I did a lot of

1956
01:35:01,849 --> 01:35:08,090
extractions at that point in time but it

1957
01:35:06,139 --> 01:35:10,400
wasn't conducive to spreading it around

1958
01:35:08,090 --> 01:35:13,340
the internet didn't really open up to

1959
01:35:10,399 --> 01:35:17,868
Mike in 98 when it did I published

1960
01:35:13,340 --> 01:35:20,599
online on several places and I you know

1961
01:35:17,868 --> 01:35:22,969
I wish only the best for the community

1962
01:35:20,599 --> 01:35:25,880
but I know that there's some things that

1963
01:35:22,969 --> 01:35:27,948
nobody has looked at yet because if they

1964
01:35:25,880 --> 01:35:31,730
did I would have heard about it if

1965
01:35:27,948 --> 01:35:37,069
nowhere else your own hash Church indeed

1966
01:35:31,729 --> 01:35:40,819
indeed time for a rip yes before twenty

1967
01:35:37,069 --> 01:35:46,579
K screen long rip yeah I can do other

1968
01:35:40,819 --> 01:35:49,340
lovers mother lovers lovers that won't

1969
01:35:46,579 --> 01:35:51,349
sounded pretty decent you gotta you

1970
01:35:49,340 --> 01:35:55,579
gotta get that deep in there gotta get

1971
01:35:51,349 --> 01:35:56,739
the grit by the way hello chin hello

1972
01:35:55,579 --> 01:36:02,210
Andrew

1973
01:35:56,738 --> 01:36:04,279
ant yeah one thing I wanted to say too

1974
01:36:02,210 --> 01:36:07,279
is that you know it's really interesting

1975
01:36:04,279 --> 01:36:10,519
as a grower a lot of experimentations

1976
01:36:07,279 --> 01:36:12,979
and a lot of original thought comes from

1977
01:36:10,520 --> 01:36:15,230
failures you know different kind of crop

1978
01:36:12,979 --> 01:36:16,939
failures and when you're growing in

1979
01:36:15,229 --> 01:36:18,678
thousands of plants you know out in the

1980
01:36:16,939 --> 01:36:21,319
bush is where it all started for a lot

1981
01:36:18,679 --> 01:36:24,260
of us you know crop failures or maybe

1982
01:36:21,319 --> 01:36:26,799
something seeding out or you know you

1983
01:36:24,260 --> 01:36:30,800
have a huge massive snow and ice storm

1984
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:32,239
you know in September so it forces you

1985
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:34,039
to really have to think outside of the

1986
01:36:32,238 --> 01:36:36,799
box and a lot of extractions and

1987
01:36:34,039 --> 01:36:38,300
original thought come from growers you

1988
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:40,090
know that have had different types of

1989
01:36:38,300 --> 01:36:43,969
failures and successes along the way

1990
01:36:40,090 --> 01:36:51,949
that's right failure is the mother of

1991
01:36:43,969 --> 01:36:53,630
invention snowstorms in September yeah

1992
01:36:51,948 --> 01:36:55,759
but those snowstorms really helped us

1993
01:36:53,630 --> 01:36:57,260
out you know in creating a whole lot of

1994
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:59,270
our different strains that we have going

1995
01:36:57,260 --> 01:37:00,829
on and really thankful for them which

1996
01:36:59,270 --> 01:37:03,110
which plants made it out of a snowstorm

1997
01:37:00,829 --> 01:37:06,439
and which ones didn't is is a really

1998
01:37:03,109 --> 01:37:08,210
enlightening thing to find out and I

1999
01:37:06,439 --> 01:37:11,238
wouldn't trade Canada for the South for

2000
01:37:08,210 --> 01:37:12,560
anything gotta tell you I have a bonsai

2001
01:37:11,238 --> 01:37:14,269
teacher who says you won't learn

2002
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:16,880
anything until you kill your first

2003
01:37:14,270 --> 01:37:20,570
hundred trees and it goes along that

2004
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:22,760
sentiment you know and it takes seven

2005
01:37:20,569 --> 01:37:25,340
years to master each type of tree they

2006
01:37:22,760 --> 01:37:26,730
say which is also applicable because

2007
01:37:25,340 --> 01:37:30,029
each type of Jeanette

2008
01:37:26,729 --> 01:37:32,069
it takes a while for you and a few years

2009
01:37:30,029 --> 01:37:34,949
for you to understand by growing it and

2010
01:37:32,069 --> 01:37:37,139
it's failing and it parts of it dying

2011
01:37:34,949 --> 01:37:39,659
and then getting it nursing it back to

2012
01:37:37,140 --> 01:37:42,000
health etc etc so that you learn to see

2013
01:37:39,659 --> 01:37:44,279
the signs as well as you know what is

2014
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:47,159
the optimization that you can get from

2015
01:37:44,279 --> 01:37:50,279
that particular genetic as well it's

2016
01:37:47,159 --> 01:37:51,630
fascinating this planet absolutely and

2017
01:37:50,279 --> 01:37:54,389
the other thing you know talking a lot

2018
01:37:51,630 --> 01:37:56,819
about microbials you know today and

2019
01:37:54,390 --> 01:37:59,550
microbial counts and the DNA and all of

2020
01:37:56,819 --> 01:38:02,399
that sort of stuff with it is that a lot

2021
01:37:59,550 --> 01:38:04,739
of that testing you know that you start

2022
01:38:02,399 --> 01:38:06,689
to figure out comes from failures in

2023
01:38:04,739 --> 01:38:08,519
your crops you know it comes from oh

2024
01:38:06,689 --> 01:38:10,829
geez I've got something going on and

2025
01:38:08,520 --> 01:38:12,660
what can I spray on it what can I spray

2026
01:38:10,829 --> 01:38:15,210
on it what kind of recipes can I utilize

2027
01:38:12,659 --> 01:38:17,309
what's gonna harm at what's gonna hurt

2028
01:38:15,210 --> 01:38:21,149
it you know and that's really where Josh

2029
01:38:17,310 --> 01:38:23,550
and I you know thrive is actually from a

2030
01:38:21,149 --> 01:38:25,379
lot of our failures you know when we had

2031
01:38:23,550 --> 01:38:27,570
our very very first broad might a long

2032
01:38:25,380 --> 01:38:29,069
time ago we took that broad might and

2033
01:38:27,569 --> 01:38:31,739
then we studied it you know for nine

2034
01:38:29,069 --> 01:38:33,569
weeks and really found out everything

2035
01:38:31,739 --> 01:38:35,250
there was to find out about it what kind

2036
01:38:33,569 --> 01:38:37,409
of sprays worked what didn't you know

2037
01:38:35,250 --> 01:38:39,149
and in the end you know as far as

2038
01:38:37,409 --> 01:38:41,639
talking about microbials we're back to

2039
01:38:39,149 --> 01:38:43,529
heat treatment over and over again so

2040
01:38:41,640 --> 01:38:47,310
that microbials really aren't a part of

2041
01:38:43,529 --> 01:38:50,550
the conversation as far as cultivation

2042
01:38:47,310 --> 01:38:53,100
goes so been really thankful for our

2043
01:38:50,550 --> 01:38:55,739
failures to learn a lot and our

2044
01:38:53,100 --> 01:38:57,600
successes for sure but through through

2045
01:38:55,739 --> 01:38:59,369
our huge successes and failures we've

2046
01:38:57,600 --> 01:39:01,350
been able to do a lot of education and

2047
01:38:59,369 --> 01:39:03,869
help people out so that they can also be

2048
01:39:01,350 --> 01:39:08,579
successful you want to learn a thing

2049
01:39:03,869 --> 01:39:10,769
teach it and backward wave from that

2050
01:39:08,579 --> 01:39:13,949
will teach you everything there is to

2051
01:39:10,770 --> 01:39:15,600
know about that subject I wanted to

2052
01:39:13,949 --> 01:39:18,869
learn Anatomy when I was going to

2053
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:21,750
pre-med school and I was utterly failing

2054
01:39:18,869 --> 01:39:23,880
it was so difficult and someone gave me

2055
01:39:21,750 --> 01:39:26,369
that advice so I started a class

2056
01:39:23,880 --> 01:39:29,609
teaching people who even knew less than

2057
01:39:26,369 --> 01:39:32,550
I about Anatomy and by a year later I

2058
01:39:29,609 --> 01:39:35,219
was a fantastic anatomist I can discuss

2059
01:39:32,550 --> 01:39:37,640
everything from the level of the caesium

2060
01:39:35,220 --> 01:39:40,380
of the bone all the way out but it took

2061
01:39:37,640 --> 01:39:43,650
me wanting to teach

2062
01:39:40,380 --> 01:39:45,590
so your effort of teaching is a powerful

2063
01:39:43,649 --> 01:39:49,139
back wave to your own learning

2064
01:39:45,590 --> 01:39:50,819
there's no that's for sure

2065
01:39:49,140 --> 01:39:53,970
I'm in full of greens with that

2066
01:39:50,819 --> 01:39:56,819
statement and I could see what it is as

2067
01:39:53,970 --> 01:40:00,570
well as he nods his head in affirmation

2068
01:39:56,819 --> 01:40:03,750
yes I wanted to jump in and share a

2069
01:40:00,569 --> 01:40:07,759
little story I when we're talk about

2070
01:40:03,750 --> 01:40:09,810
failure and learning from failure

2071
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:13,050
Harlequin

2072
01:40:09,810 --> 01:40:16,380
when Harlequin first happened the group

2073
01:40:13,050 --> 01:40:20,760
of patients patients in the collective

2074
01:40:16,380 --> 01:40:24,119
that I had in those days it was a

2075
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:26,400
failure virtually every person in the

2076
01:40:24,119 --> 01:40:29,279
group that got some of those early

2077
01:40:26,399 --> 01:40:31,679
flowers said yeah oh I like the way it

2078
01:40:29,279 --> 01:40:34,619
looks loved the way it smells but you

2079
01:40:31,680 --> 01:40:38,010
know it doesn't get me stoned man and

2080
01:40:34,619 --> 01:40:40,260
that's like what's the point but one

2081
01:40:38,010 --> 01:40:43,350
person one person in that whole group

2082
01:40:40,260 --> 01:40:47,159
said his shoulder that he had torn up

2083
01:40:43,350 --> 01:40:51,120
playing football in school had hurt so

2084
01:40:47,159 --> 01:40:52,710
much since he had metal parts put in and

2085
01:40:51,119 --> 01:40:56,699
his shoulder hurts so much he'd been in

2086
01:40:52,710 --> 01:40:59,760
and out of opioid rehab a bunch of times

2087
01:40:56,699 --> 01:41:01,769
trying to kick painkillers and he said

2088
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:04,710
it's the damndest thing I smoked a joint

2089
01:41:01,770 --> 01:41:08,340
of this [ __ ] and it doesn't hurt anymore

2090
01:41:04,710 --> 01:41:12,119
Wade what the [ __ ] and that's when I got

2091
01:41:08,340 --> 01:41:14,550
it tested and because yeah up until the

2092
01:41:12,119 --> 01:41:17,880
I got it tested harlequin looked like a

2093
01:41:14,550 --> 01:41:19,890
disaster because I had a whole room not

2094
01:41:17,880 --> 01:41:23,670
just a room a building just to be honest

2095
01:41:19,890 --> 01:41:25,020
a building full of these plants and none

2096
01:41:23,670 --> 01:41:32,039
of the people that were so going to be

2097
01:41:25,020 --> 01:41:34,760
using them wanted it and yeah in terms

2098
01:41:32,039 --> 01:41:37,739
of learning what ender was saying about

2099
01:41:34,760 --> 01:41:40,619
teaching trying to share the information

2100
01:41:37,739 --> 01:41:42,389
that each of us has learned in this kind

2101
01:41:40,619 --> 01:41:43,590
of a context here the hash Church it's

2102
01:41:42,390 --> 01:41:46,380
part of what I love about the

2103
01:41:43,590 --> 01:41:49,590
opportunity to be here but going out

2104
01:41:46,380 --> 01:41:51,930
into your community normalizing our work

2105
01:41:49,590 --> 01:41:54,340
helping people understand that we're not

2106
01:41:51,930 --> 01:41:56,920
criminals we're not

2107
01:41:54,340 --> 01:42:00,479
we're not out to hurt the environment

2108
01:41:56,920 --> 01:42:03,819
we're not out to hurt kids were

2109
01:42:00,479 --> 01:42:06,909
restoring this plant if you will to its

2110
01:42:03,819 --> 01:42:10,960
rightful place that's really what's

2111
01:42:06,908 --> 01:42:13,089
going on and part of what I appreciate

2112
01:42:10,960 --> 01:42:16,840
about Marcus you framing this

2113
01:42:13,090 --> 01:42:19,809
conversation as hash church is Church

2114
01:42:16,840 --> 01:42:22,199
implies a certain religious or spiritual

2115
01:42:19,809 --> 01:42:26,038
point of view about it and I for one

2116
01:42:22,198 --> 01:42:29,169
feel a religious if not passionate

2117
01:42:26,038 --> 01:42:32,828
missionary zeal about the fact that this

2118
01:42:29,170 --> 01:42:35,319
plant can't hurt you and that as we

2119
01:42:32,828 --> 01:42:38,529
learn more about how to work with this

2120
01:42:35,319 --> 01:42:42,130
plant we start seeing really remarked my

2121
01:42:38,529 --> 01:42:45,130
rock ulis things happen I just it's it

2122
01:42:42,130 --> 01:42:47,819
is a miracle plant it is in fact as the

2123
01:42:45,130 --> 01:42:55,328
rust assay the healing of the peoples

2124
01:42:47,819 --> 01:42:57,639
and we like it's like a fractal medicine

2125
01:42:55,328 --> 01:43:00,849
because you know everything that you do

2126
01:42:57,639 --> 01:43:02,920
to it it fractals out into you know a

2127
01:43:00,849 --> 01:43:05,078
different form and even within the

2128
01:43:02,920 --> 01:43:07,149
learning of it you know it's a fractal

2129
01:43:05,078 --> 01:43:09,609
of learning because there's it's such an

2130
01:43:07,149 --> 01:43:11,768
adaptogenic you know plant that there's

2131
01:43:09,609 --> 01:43:14,198
just so much variation to it that is it

2132
01:43:11,769 --> 01:43:15,820
it's like a beautiful story that you

2133
01:43:14,198 --> 01:43:18,238
know you just keep learning about and

2134
01:43:15,819 --> 01:43:21,130
it's just unfolding in front of you and

2135
01:43:18,238 --> 01:43:23,738
everything you just said brings to mind

2136
01:43:21,130 --> 01:43:25,389
that it's almost in a way now with all

2137
01:43:23,738 --> 01:43:29,049
the legalization and stuff that we're

2138
01:43:25,389 --> 01:43:31,328
almost going back into a private thing

2139
01:43:29,050 --> 01:43:34,960
with IE peas and everything and almost

2140
01:43:31,328 --> 01:43:36,099
going into you know a protective way you

2141
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:38,439
know it's almost the opposite of

2142
01:43:36,099 --> 01:43:40,119
teaching it was like as recreational and

2143
01:43:38,439 --> 01:43:41,710
every and legalization was coming there

2144
01:43:40,118 --> 01:43:43,859
was a lot of openness and a lot of

2145
01:43:41,710 --> 01:43:46,658
people sharing and everything and now

2146
01:43:43,859 --> 01:43:50,228
we're almost moving into a protective

2147
01:43:46,658 --> 01:43:52,719
you know IP state and I and I get why

2148
01:43:50,229 --> 01:43:54,280
that is on a lot of levels and stuff and

2149
01:43:52,719 --> 01:43:56,219
so and there's nothing wrong with that

2150
01:43:54,279 --> 01:43:58,328
but I just you know that's part of what

2151
01:43:56,219 --> 01:44:00,189
you know we're dealing with the pure

2152
01:43:58,328 --> 01:44:01,719
certification is just keeping knowledge

2153
01:44:00,189 --> 01:44:03,460
out there and just keeping the

2154
01:44:01,719 --> 01:44:05,469
inspiration out there so people can

2155
01:44:03,460 --> 01:44:06,289
continue to learn and I agree with you

2156
01:44:05,469 --> 01:44:07,640
that thank you

2157
01:44:06,289 --> 01:44:09,859
Marcus you know for everything you've

2158
01:44:07,640 --> 01:44:12,140
done to keep this going and it's

2159
01:44:09,859 --> 01:44:14,479
exciting for us to learn from people all

2160
01:44:12,140 --> 01:44:16,160
over you know meeting Daniel and and

2161
01:44:14,479 --> 01:44:18,619
Whistler and seeing everything he's

2162
01:44:16,159 --> 01:44:21,590
doing and having an opportunity to be in

2163
01:44:18,619 --> 01:44:24,739
Nelson and going through Eugene here and

2164
01:44:21,590 --> 01:44:26,930
we're on our way to Arcada beneficial

2165
01:44:24,739 --> 01:44:29,569
living center and southern humble to out

2166
01:44:26,930 --> 01:44:31,670
them low and down to Koval Oh for the

2167
01:44:29,569 --> 01:44:34,670
son roots farm and we're just doing a

2168
01:44:31,670 --> 01:44:37,609
big to our farm so that we can continue

2169
01:44:34,670 --> 01:44:39,380
learning and we can share you know what

2170
01:44:37,609 --> 01:44:41,269
we're learning with everyone too so

2171
01:44:39,380 --> 01:44:44,359
we're on the mission of you know

2172
01:44:41,270 --> 01:44:47,510
connecting good people and good products

2173
01:44:44,359 --> 01:44:49,099
and also just the learning train and I

2174
01:44:47,510 --> 01:44:51,949
think that the most important thing that

2175
01:44:49,100 --> 01:44:54,200
you know sort of to add on to what you

2176
01:44:51,949 --> 01:44:56,510
were saying wade is that we are entering

2177
01:44:54,199 --> 01:44:59,059
a global market and it absolutely is

2178
01:44:56,510 --> 01:45:00,980
imperative for the people and the

2179
01:44:59,060 --> 01:45:03,680
businesses who have a really tight

2180
01:45:00,979 --> 01:45:06,949
connection with this plant to join

2181
01:45:03,680 --> 01:45:08,750
together to you know make a stance when

2182
01:45:06,949 --> 01:45:10,250
we go into the global market because

2183
01:45:08,750 --> 01:45:12,050
right now in Oregon you know they're

2184
01:45:10,250 --> 01:45:14,329
dealing with an island here they can't

2185
01:45:12,050 --> 01:45:16,550
sell outside of their island it makes it

2186
01:45:14,329 --> 01:45:18,500
very difficult and a lot of people who

2187
01:45:16,550 --> 01:45:20,360
have had really long time relationships

2188
01:45:18,500 --> 01:45:22,550
with this plant and who have been

2189
01:45:20,359 --> 01:45:25,399
cultivating it or concentrating it for a

2190
01:45:22,550 --> 01:45:27,590
long time have either had to step out or

2191
01:45:25,399 --> 01:45:29,809
had to step way back from their

2192
01:45:27,590 --> 01:45:31,699
involvement with the plant and we just

2193
01:45:29,810 --> 01:45:33,890
are really encouraging those people to

2194
01:45:31,699 --> 01:45:35,599
stay involved with it whether it be

2195
01:45:33,890 --> 01:45:37,250
through education or whether it be

2196
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:39,860
through your business because when it

2197
01:45:37,250 --> 01:45:41,029
does go to a large global market you

2198
01:45:39,859 --> 01:45:43,309
know the people who have had

2199
01:45:41,029 --> 01:45:45,229
relationships with the plants are going

2200
01:45:43,310 --> 01:45:46,430
to shine and I think that it's

2201
01:45:45,229 --> 01:45:50,179
imperative that we continue our

2202
01:45:46,430 --> 01:45:52,250
education I like it it sounds all

2203
01:45:50,180 --> 01:45:55,400
perfect to me I appreciate all of you

2204
01:45:52,250 --> 01:45:57,500
thank you it's great it's great to be

2205
01:45:55,399 --> 01:46:00,259
able to gather on a Sunday morning and

2206
01:45:57,500 --> 01:46:02,420
sort of just get into this I guess it is

2207
01:46:00,260 --> 01:46:04,520
funny because I really chose that church

2208
01:46:02,420 --> 01:46:07,310
I mean honestly I named it hashed Church

2209
01:46:04,520 --> 01:46:09,320
for the simple reason that I hit this

2210
01:46:07,310 --> 01:46:13,730
milestone I was allowed to suddenly

2211
01:46:09,319 --> 01:46:17,000
stream and it was like 8 o'clock or 8:30

2212
01:46:13,729 --> 01:46:19,218
on a Sunday morning and I was like okay

2213
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:21,050
what would I call my show and I thought

2214
01:46:19,219 --> 01:46:24,408
we used to gather for some days and we

2215
01:46:21,050 --> 01:46:26,570
call the church not Jesus Church but

2216
01:46:24,408 --> 01:46:28,759
actual cannabis Church we used to meet

2217
01:46:26,569 --> 01:46:30,349
at my friend Amir's restaurant that was

2218
01:46:28,760 --> 01:46:33,170
right across the street from the melting

2219
01:46:30,349 --> 01:46:34,849
point my gallery and we called the

2220
01:46:33,170 --> 01:46:36,828
church so I thought Here I am all these

2221
01:46:34,849 --> 01:46:38,659
years later very focused on hash I'll

2222
01:46:36,828 --> 01:46:40,819
call it hash Church I think I even

2223
01:46:38,658 --> 01:46:42,649
called the first one like a Sunday

2224
01:46:40,819 --> 01:46:45,649
morning hash Church with bubble man or

2225
01:46:42,649 --> 01:46:47,719
something and had no idea I would do it

2226
01:46:45,649 --> 01:46:51,198
like a hundred and seventy more times in

2227
01:46:47,719 --> 01:46:52,939
a row with all of you it was just

2228
01:46:51,198 --> 01:46:54,638
ridiculous but yeah it's neat that

2229
01:46:52,939 --> 01:46:58,009
church happened to be in the name

2230
01:46:54,639 --> 01:47:01,159
because it is very much sort of a

2231
01:46:58,010 --> 01:47:03,380
spiritual guiding light that in my life

2232
01:47:01,158 --> 01:47:05,899
for for the last 25 years I've

2233
01:47:03,380 --> 01:47:08,719
definitely followed it down some pretty

2234
01:47:05,899 --> 01:47:11,689
cool corridors down some very cool paths

2235
01:47:08,719 --> 01:47:14,380
and there just seems to be an endless

2236
01:47:11,689 --> 01:47:18,198
amount of paths it's like this fractal

2237
01:47:14,380 --> 01:47:20,659
infinity of amounts of directions it can

2238
01:47:18,198 --> 01:47:22,009
take you and regardless of and I'm

2239
01:47:20,658 --> 01:47:26,029
always excited about it that's the thing

2240
01:47:22,010 --> 01:47:28,159
I like about cannabis is that in in my

2241
01:47:26,029 --> 01:47:29,868
work with cannabis I can now start

2242
01:47:28,158 --> 01:47:31,399
getting excited about all these other

2243
01:47:29,868 --> 01:47:33,859
things whether it's you know growing

2244
01:47:31,399 --> 01:47:35,538
acres in Jamaica and processing or

2245
01:47:33,859 --> 01:47:38,299
whether it's building this giant lab

2246
01:47:35,538 --> 01:47:39,469
here in DC or working with Whistler

2247
01:47:38,300 --> 01:47:42,380
technologies to bring new technologies

2248
01:47:39,469 --> 01:47:44,239
to light and helping in you know

2249
01:47:42,380 --> 01:47:47,090
commercialize that water extraction

2250
01:47:44,238 --> 01:47:49,488
process I'm always excited about it

2251
01:47:47,090 --> 01:47:51,769
because cannabis is involved and I you

2252
01:47:49,488 --> 01:47:53,928
know I end up in some situations that if

2253
01:47:51,769 --> 01:47:55,670
cannabis wasn't there I'd be like wow

2254
01:47:53,929 --> 01:47:57,739
this would be pretty boring like I'm

2255
01:47:55,670 --> 01:47:59,899
just in a big manufacturing plant right

2256
01:47:57,738 --> 01:48:02,178
now I wouldn't be super stoked on this

2257
01:47:59,899 --> 01:48:04,609
if it wasn't for the fact that they're

2258
01:48:02,179 --> 01:48:07,550
manufacturing like hemp products like

2259
01:48:04,609 --> 01:48:09,649
oils and protein powder isolates and all

2260
01:48:07,550 --> 01:48:11,059
of these different things that suddenly

2261
01:48:09,649 --> 01:48:14,058
you know I walk into a room and there's

2262
01:48:11,059 --> 01:48:17,150
just like I don't know how many hundreds

2263
01:48:14,059 --> 01:48:19,219
of thousands of pounds of seeds just in

2264
01:48:17,149 --> 01:48:21,888
these giant totes that are taller than

2265
01:48:19,219 --> 01:48:24,710
me and you know huge like five feet

2266
01:48:21,889 --> 01:48:27,078
round and he's just got a giant room

2267
01:48:24,710 --> 01:48:29,868
full of them I was just like man this is

2268
01:48:27,078 --> 01:48:32,359
this is exciting I love I love working

2269
01:48:29,868 --> 01:48:33,029
with cannabis and I think I think it's

2270
01:48:32,359 --> 01:48:35,519
one of the

2271
01:48:33,029 --> 01:48:36,779
we're all very lucky to be involved in

2272
01:48:35,520 --> 01:48:39,120
this industry and one of the things

2273
01:48:36,779 --> 01:48:42,479
people ask me often is how can I get

2274
01:48:39,119 --> 01:48:45,510
involved in this industry and how do you

2275
01:48:42,479 --> 01:48:47,309
answer that I mean just get involved I

2276
01:48:45,510 --> 01:48:49,020
mean do you guys have good advice for

2277
01:48:47,310 --> 01:48:50,700
that because I always I'm like I'm

2278
01:48:49,020 --> 01:48:53,370
always like follow your passion bla bla

2279
01:48:50,699 --> 01:48:55,139
bla I don't really know what to say in

2280
01:48:53,369 --> 01:48:57,659
regards to how do you get into the

2281
01:48:55,140 --> 01:49:01,860
industry cuz all I do is just start

2282
01:48:57,659 --> 01:49:05,789
growing wheat grow your own well your

2283
01:49:01,859 --> 01:49:08,519
own plant but you know don't get

2284
01:49:05,789 --> 01:49:10,800
arrested don't get arrested don't get a

2285
01:49:08,520 --> 01:49:12,840
felony don't get a felony more than

2286
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:16,529
anything else it's the most important

2287
01:49:12,840 --> 01:49:18,329
put together a resume you know go down

2288
01:49:16,529 --> 01:49:21,329
to find these distributors find these

2289
01:49:18,329 --> 01:49:23,340
people volunteer that's I got I got

2290
01:49:21,329 --> 01:49:24,180
involved in this because cannabis Action

2291
01:49:23,340 --> 01:49:26,699
Network was an all-volunteer

2292
01:49:24,180 --> 01:49:29,520
organization and I just started showing

2293
01:49:26,699 --> 01:49:32,429
up and giving my time and my time on the

2294
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:34,950
phone calling people was very boring

2295
01:49:32,430 --> 01:49:36,539
initially but that led to me then being

2296
01:49:34,949 --> 01:49:38,760
on a street corner than being on the

2297
01:49:36,539 --> 01:49:41,010
street corner then allowed me to then be

2298
01:49:38,760 --> 01:49:43,590
on rock and roll tours and then doing

2299
01:49:41,010 --> 01:49:45,750
hem tour and next thing you know I get

2300
01:49:43,590 --> 01:49:47,010
hired by a company who's like hey you've

2301
01:49:45,750 --> 01:49:48,779
been out on the road and you know what

2302
01:49:47,010 --> 01:49:51,360
you're doing you know about this plant

2303
01:49:48,779 --> 01:49:53,250
hemp so come work for me and then

2304
01:49:51,359 --> 01:49:54,569
couldn't do that anymore and then came

2305
01:49:53,250 --> 01:49:56,310
back to California and have been

2306
01:49:54,569 --> 01:49:59,250
involved in medical cannabis ever since

2307
01:49:56,310 --> 01:50:01,950
so it just takes the chance be honest

2308
01:49:59,250 --> 01:50:03,930
with yourself take the chances you're

2309
01:50:01,949 --> 01:50:06,569
gonna fail you're gonna make mistakes

2310
01:50:03,930 --> 01:50:09,930
but if you really love and care about it

2311
01:50:06,569 --> 01:50:11,519
you'll find a way to plug in but I mean

2312
01:50:09,930 --> 01:50:14,760
there's lots of organizations the United

2313
01:50:11,520 --> 01:50:17,100
States there's there's College every cup

2314
01:50:14,760 --> 01:50:19,020
there's college campuses that have

2315
01:50:17,100 --> 01:50:20,250
organizations if there's not one you can

2316
01:50:19,020 --> 01:50:23,550
get in contact with

2317
01:50:20,250 --> 01:50:26,850
mpps SSDP students for sensible drug

2318
01:50:23,550 --> 01:50:29,130
policy maps they'll all help you set up

2319
01:50:26,850 --> 01:50:31,380
chapters on a university so you can find

2320
01:50:29,130 --> 01:50:34,199
other like-minded people and that's what

2321
01:50:31,380 --> 01:50:36,390
we did where we would go around then to

2322
01:50:34,199 --> 01:50:38,460
free speech areas on college campuses in

2323
01:50:36,390 --> 01:50:40,079
the United States I've been through 47

2324
01:50:38,460 --> 01:50:42,720
states doing this I know I've done it

2325
01:50:40,079 --> 01:50:44,550
firsthand and I did it wasn't paid for

2326
01:50:42,720 --> 01:50:45,780
it I volunteered my time but they paid

2327
01:50:44,550 --> 01:50:47,849
our money

2328
01:50:45,779 --> 01:50:50,488
our food and our travel and everything

2329
01:50:47,849 --> 01:50:53,250
else so it's one of those realities that

2330
01:50:50,488 --> 01:50:55,288
you just have to sometimes take the the

2331
01:50:53,250 --> 01:50:56,819
chance and get out there and there are

2332
01:50:55,288 --> 01:50:59,429
companies hiring all throughout

2333
01:50:56,819 --> 01:51:01,019
California even the Bureau of cannabis

2334
01:50:59,429 --> 01:51:03,328
control is hiring needs to hire a

2335
01:51:01,020 --> 01:51:05,429
thousand people they need inspectors

2336
01:51:03,328 --> 01:51:08,399
they need people who go out you know and

2337
01:51:05,429 --> 01:51:11,099
and look and regionally so there's all

2338
01:51:08,399 --> 01:51:13,259
areas around the the state that they're

2339
01:51:11,099 --> 01:51:14,788
gonna need regional coordinators so of

2340
01:51:13,260 --> 01:51:16,889
course those may have some sort of

2341
01:51:14,788 --> 01:51:18,750
educational requirements but there's

2342
01:51:16,889 --> 01:51:20,340
different ways that you can plug in I'm

2343
01:51:18,750 --> 01:51:21,868
only giving California as an example

2344
01:51:20,340 --> 01:51:25,559
because that's the example that I have

2345
01:51:21,868 --> 01:51:27,929
currently and that I've used but find

2346
01:51:25,559 --> 01:51:31,440
people get in there be honest be

2347
01:51:27,929 --> 01:51:33,690
trustworthy be forthright be honest and

2348
01:51:31,439 --> 01:51:35,399
anything can happen I mean you can end

2349
01:51:33,689 --> 01:51:38,098
up just like one of us and be on the

2350
01:51:35,399 --> 01:51:42,868
panel one day you know I like her at all

2351
01:51:38,099 --> 01:51:44,250
I would also say that learn about

2352
01:51:42,868 --> 01:51:45,808
something that you're interested in

2353
01:51:44,250 --> 01:51:48,538
because that knowledge is really

2354
01:51:45,809 --> 01:51:51,570
powerful and that's how you get into a

2355
01:51:48,538 --> 01:51:53,219
place you want to be so whatever your

2356
01:51:51,569 --> 01:51:55,139
passion is learn about it and then

2357
01:51:53,219 --> 01:51:56,489
display that knowledge go meet people in

2358
01:51:55,139 --> 01:51:58,559
the industry as everyone else has said

2359
01:51:56,488 --> 01:52:00,388
and just get out there because the more

2360
01:51:58,559 --> 01:52:01,949
you learn the more you'll be able you're

2361
01:52:00,389 --> 01:52:03,690
going to be able to help people or help

2362
01:52:01,948 --> 01:52:06,719
yourself and you'll get where you want

2363
01:52:03,689 --> 01:52:08,038
to be right there's also regional like

2364
01:52:06,719 --> 01:52:11,279
National cannabis Industry Association

2365
01:52:08,038 --> 01:52:13,529
now has regional quarterly meetings in

2366
01:52:11,279 --> 01:52:16,288
certain states and areas so you can go

2367
01:52:13,529 --> 01:52:18,779
down and meet people and rub elbows with

2368
01:52:16,288 --> 01:52:20,670
local business owners ask them questions

2369
01:52:18,779 --> 01:52:22,738
ask ways how how you can plug in but

2370
01:52:20,670 --> 01:52:24,750
most importantly is yes if you want to

2371
01:52:22,738 --> 01:52:26,669
get involved seriously if you want to be

2372
01:52:24,750 --> 01:52:28,529
a grower then you know you can go to

2373
01:52:26,670 --> 01:52:31,199
college and actually get you know

2374
01:52:28,529 --> 01:52:33,090
degrees in botany and biology as well as

2375
01:52:31,198 --> 01:52:35,158
chemistry as the doctor will tell you

2376
01:52:33,090 --> 01:52:37,679
because these are all things that we

2377
01:52:35,158 --> 01:52:40,219
need we need researchers we need doctors

2378
01:52:37,679 --> 01:52:42,510
we have research enough to last for

2379
01:52:40,219 --> 01:52:45,840
generations right Doc's we have

2380
01:52:42,510 --> 01:52:48,449
literally generations of of just from

2381
01:52:45,840 --> 01:52:50,489
hemp alone I mean high-grade cannabis

2382
01:52:48,448 --> 01:52:53,189
all that type of research needs to be

2383
01:52:50,488 --> 01:52:55,709
done as well as we need to set up a germ

2384
01:52:53,189 --> 01:52:58,678
plasm Institute in North America which

2385
01:52:55,710 --> 01:52:59,710
we need stewards and growers and seed

2386
01:52:58,679 --> 01:53:02,020
producers

2387
01:52:59,710 --> 01:53:04,750
and you know all those realities are

2388
01:53:02,020 --> 01:53:06,670
still yet to you know see the light of

2389
01:53:04,750 --> 01:53:08,829
day but those are realities that have to

2390
01:53:06,670 --> 01:53:10,630
take place in time so if you're watching

2391
01:53:08,829 --> 01:53:15,238
there's still ways for you to plug in

2392
01:53:10,630 --> 01:53:18,460
and be part of that future in reality I

2393
01:53:15,238 --> 01:53:20,199
like I liked all those answers I

2394
01:53:18,460 --> 01:53:22,510
definitely they kind of were unique

2395
01:53:20,199 --> 01:53:24,849
because they were like each of your

2396
01:53:22,510 --> 01:53:27,820
versions of kind of how you went about

2397
01:53:24,850 --> 01:53:30,610
doing what you had to do to get into

2398
01:53:27,819 --> 01:53:35,529
this industry but I have to say Wade's

2399
01:53:30,609 --> 01:53:37,509
was my favorite like grow cannabis grow

2400
01:53:35,529 --> 01:53:39,880
it to get to know it it's like really

2401
01:53:37,510 --> 01:53:41,650
that is like so simple and yet so

2402
01:53:39,880 --> 01:53:45,250
completely accurate of course

2403
01:53:41,649 --> 01:53:47,349
grow cannabis now attached to mark who

2404
01:53:45,250 --> 01:53:49,119
worked in the non cannabis industry

2405
01:53:47,350 --> 01:53:51,940
right for years and it was kind of

2406
01:53:49,119 --> 01:53:54,909
boring like you said mark you walk into

2407
01:53:51,939 --> 01:53:56,529
a plan and if you're making sneakers or

2408
01:53:54,909 --> 01:53:58,630
you're making a rubber for the end of

2409
01:53:56,529 --> 01:54:00,460
the sneaker whatever you're you're fit

2410
01:53:58,630 --> 01:54:03,670
you're plants making it's not as

2411
01:54:00,460 --> 01:54:06,789
exciting as making you know hash or

2412
01:54:03,670 --> 01:54:09,190
medicine for people and you know around

2413
01:54:06,789 --> 01:54:13,840
the plant we love and so I was just

2414
01:54:09,189 --> 01:54:17,229
lucky and fortunate to intersect my

2415
01:54:13,840 --> 01:54:19,989
passion with what I can do for a living

2416
01:54:17,229 --> 01:54:22,479
and that's always a wonderful thing to

2417
01:54:19,988 --> 01:54:24,279
be able to put those two things together

2418
01:54:22,479 --> 01:54:27,119
it's like a constructive interference

2419
01:54:24,279 --> 01:54:29,469
pattern that where you get a greater

2420
01:54:27,119 --> 01:54:31,899
superposition and you'll be farther

2421
01:54:29,469 --> 01:54:33,760
along than you would be if you did any

2422
01:54:31,899 --> 01:54:36,488
one of those things individually but

2423
01:54:33,760 --> 01:54:40,329
together those things push you to places

2424
01:54:36,488 --> 01:54:43,269
that you may never have been and in

2425
01:54:40,329 --> 01:54:46,029
terms of failure I mean it's kind of

2426
01:54:43,270 --> 01:54:48,910
like you'll learn so the scientific

2427
01:54:46,029 --> 01:54:51,488
method is like you want to probe

2428
01:54:48,909 --> 01:54:55,149
something about some phenomenon so you

2429
01:54:51,488 --> 01:54:57,250
design a hypothesis and experiment to

2430
01:54:55,149 --> 01:54:59,529
answer the question and then you run the

2431
01:54:57,250 --> 01:55:01,899
experiment collect the data and come up

2432
01:54:59,529 --> 01:55:04,269
with the conclusion well you know as a

2433
01:55:01,899 --> 01:55:07,479
scientist who's run thousands of

2434
01:55:04,270 --> 01:55:09,969
experiments that totally failed that's

2435
01:55:07,479 --> 01:55:12,959
how you learn and that's how you define

2436
01:55:09,969 --> 01:55:16,079
the moment of invention because

2437
01:55:12,960 --> 01:55:17,640
as soon as something doesn't fail you

2438
01:55:16,079 --> 01:55:19,469
know what failures look like because

2439
01:55:17,640 --> 01:55:20,940
you've seen that like a hundred times

2440
01:55:19,469 --> 01:55:24,140
but as soon as you put something

2441
01:55:20,939 --> 01:55:26,939
together that totally is now you know

2442
01:55:24,140 --> 01:55:29,150
something new I mean that's that aha

2443
01:55:26,939 --> 01:55:31,559
moment that you know yeah I've done

2444
01:55:29,149 --> 01:55:34,250
something completely new that no one has

2445
01:55:31,560 --> 01:55:38,430
ever done before and so I think it's

2446
01:55:34,250 --> 01:55:41,159
inspiring to have you know some type of

2447
01:55:38,430 --> 01:55:43,829
you know educational background so what

2448
01:55:41,159 --> 01:55:46,619
you bring to the table is scientifically

2449
01:55:43,829 --> 01:55:49,170
grounded and then launching yourself

2450
01:55:46,619 --> 01:55:52,140
into this new industry I mean I can

2451
01:55:49,170 --> 01:55:54,359
imagine going into so many different

2452
01:55:52,140 --> 01:55:57,360
careers and getting so many different

2453
01:55:54,359 --> 01:56:00,619
educational experiences whether it's in

2454
01:55:57,359 --> 01:56:04,889
botany or chemistry or business or

2455
01:56:00,619 --> 01:56:07,949
nowadays I mean geez just go into the MJ

2456
01:56:04,890 --> 01:56:11,420
biz Khan there's more engineering and

2457
01:56:07,949 --> 01:56:13,710
manufacturing engineering or you know

2458
01:56:11,420 --> 01:56:17,039
Industrial Engineering what I'll call

2459
01:56:13,710 --> 01:56:19,079
you know packaging automated packaging

2460
01:56:17,039 --> 01:56:21,210
automated dispensing if it could be

2461
01:56:19,079 --> 01:56:23,819
automated it's coming to the cannabis

2462
01:56:21,210 --> 01:56:27,689
industry so there's just so many

2463
01:56:23,819 --> 01:56:30,988
different areas where innovation is

2464
01:56:27,689 --> 01:56:32,729
happening and imagine what that cannabis

2465
01:56:30,988 --> 01:56:35,039
shows is going to look like ten years

2466
01:56:32,729 --> 01:56:38,218
from now as opposed to you know where it

2467
01:56:35,039 --> 01:56:40,050
is today so it's just it's amazing to

2468
01:56:38,219 --> 01:56:42,689
think that this work the dawn of a new

2469
01:56:40,050 --> 01:56:45,539
industry that's going to plateau so I'm

2470
01:56:42,689 --> 01:56:47,369
at the time out in the future but until

2471
01:56:45,539 --> 01:56:49,380
it plateaus we're on a steep learning

2472
01:56:47,369 --> 01:56:51,809
curve we're all kinds of new shits

2473
01:56:49,380 --> 01:56:55,109
happening all the time yeah that's

2474
01:56:51,810 --> 01:56:56,610
amazing man I love that about the plan

2475
01:56:55,109 --> 01:56:58,559
everybody was talking about how it's a

2476
01:56:56,609 --> 01:57:00,779
fractal medicine and how its adaptogenic

2477
01:56:58,560 --> 01:57:02,160
and it's becoming such a large industry

2478
01:57:00,779 --> 01:57:04,229
right now that you can almost be

2479
01:57:02,159 --> 01:57:07,289
involved in anything and almost have

2480
01:57:04,229 --> 01:57:09,238
expertise in anything and it somehow is

2481
01:57:07,289 --> 01:57:11,488
going to bring itself back to the

2482
01:57:09,238 --> 01:57:13,679
cannabis industry and I think that it's

2483
01:57:11,488 --> 01:57:15,299
sort of funny you know like talking

2484
01:57:13,680 --> 01:57:16,980
about you know how do you get yourself

2485
01:57:15,300 --> 01:57:18,300
involved in the cannabis industry you

2486
01:57:16,979 --> 01:57:21,119
know that you're involved in the right

2487
01:57:18,300 --> 01:57:21,539
place if every single conversation that

2488
01:57:21,119 --> 01:57:23,489
you have

2489
01:57:21,539 --> 01:57:25,260
people surrounding you ends up in

2490
01:57:23,489 --> 01:57:28,319
cannabis I mean you can start a nuclear

2491
01:57:25,260 --> 01:57:29,880
waste yes and it ends up in cannabis and

2492
01:57:28,319 --> 01:57:32,549
to talk about the problems of the world

2493
01:57:29,880 --> 01:57:35,130
it ends up in cannabis and I think that

2494
01:57:32,550 --> 01:57:37,710
is really funny I think you got it you

2495
01:57:35,130 --> 01:57:39,480
got you have to have a passion so if you

2496
01:57:37,710 --> 01:57:41,970
have a passion you know then you're

2497
01:57:39,479 --> 01:57:44,369
gonna find a way into anything because

2498
01:57:41,970 --> 01:57:46,440
every everything is really pretty

2499
01:57:44,369 --> 01:57:48,689
competitive if you think about just all

2500
01:57:46,439 --> 01:57:51,779
any field is and because there's a lot

2501
01:57:48,689 --> 01:57:53,279
of humans on the earth but uh so and I

2502
01:57:51,779 --> 01:57:55,170
also think that with all the

2503
01:57:53,279 --> 01:57:57,119
manufacturing and engineering and all

2504
01:57:55,170 --> 01:58:00,480
the farmers and farming that's going on

2505
01:57:57,119 --> 01:58:03,090
I think that making products is is a

2506
01:58:00,479 --> 01:58:05,250
really huge you know area that we you

2507
01:58:03,090 --> 01:58:07,079
know what to do with all this material

2508
01:58:05,250 --> 01:58:09,539
so I mean I think the innovation of

2509
01:58:07,079 --> 01:58:12,510
being able to even put it in food I

2510
01:58:09,539 --> 01:58:15,539
don't understand why all the edibles are

2511
01:58:12,510 --> 01:58:19,800
mostly candy you know I mean I I would

2512
01:58:15,539 --> 01:58:23,640
eat a CBD sandwich you know or CBD soup

2513
01:58:19,800 --> 01:58:26,159
I I kind of want like the full CBD cafe

2514
01:58:23,640 --> 01:58:28,740
where the lemonade has CBD in it and

2515
01:58:26,159 --> 01:58:31,139
every damn thing in there is so you know

2516
01:58:28,739 --> 01:58:33,479
it's just a full medicinal that sounds

2517
01:58:31,140 --> 01:58:38,970
that sounds like skunk man Sam's

2518
01:58:33,479 --> 01:58:47,309
nightmare am i saying that I wouldn't

2519
01:58:38,970 --> 01:58:49,980
want a THC cafe to Cafe oh I'll have a

2520
01:58:47,310 --> 01:58:53,400
CBD sandwich with you man that's sweet

2521
01:58:49,979 --> 01:58:54,839
you know I mean CBG it doesn't have to

2522
01:58:53,399 --> 01:58:57,409
be add we're not you know we're not

2523
01:58:54,840 --> 01:58:59,659
cannabinoid us you know we want as many

2524
01:58:57,409 --> 01:59:02,340
cannabinoids in there as possible I

2525
01:58:59,659 --> 01:59:04,859
truly think your visions gonna come true

2526
01:59:02,340 --> 01:59:08,069
but it's not going to be anything weird

2527
01:59:04,859 --> 01:59:11,189
it's gonna be CBD will be fortified into

2528
01:59:08,069 --> 01:59:13,729
all foods just like vitamin C is it'll

2529
01:59:11,189 --> 01:59:16,829
be fortified from baby cereals to

2530
01:59:13,729 --> 01:59:17,250
geriatric formulations and everything in

2531
01:59:16,829 --> 01:59:20,309
between

2532
01:59:17,250 --> 01:59:23,399
all foods will contain CBD ten years

2533
01:59:20,310 --> 01:59:27,180
from now it'll just like back in 1873

2534
01:59:23,399 --> 01:59:29,039
and you know when when all of the hemp

2535
01:59:27,180 --> 01:59:31,680
was fed to the animals and the animals

2536
01:59:29,039 --> 01:59:33,619
were producing you know high CBD eggs

2537
01:59:31,680 --> 01:59:35,990
and then we were eating the egg

2538
01:59:33,619 --> 01:59:38,599
so either there was a there was an

2539
01:59:35,989 --> 01:59:41,179
intact cannabinoid system at one time

2540
01:59:38,600 --> 01:59:43,820
through all the creatures and also clean

2541
01:59:41,180 --> 01:59:46,159
the lands like you know sometimes the

2542
01:59:43,819 --> 01:59:48,380
the weed and print you know accumulates

2543
01:59:46,159 --> 01:59:49,880
the the heavy metals that means you

2544
01:59:48,380 --> 01:59:52,369
can't use that that year so you'd have

2545
01:59:49,880 --> 01:59:55,579
to put it back into the land but ya know

2546
01:59:52,369 --> 01:59:58,970
it's at least don't you think that the

2547
01:59:55,579 --> 02:00:01,069
possibility exists since our bodies are

2548
01:59:58,970 --> 02:00:04,039
prepared to use cannabinoids all the

2549
02:00:01,069 --> 02:00:06,829
time that the very first edibles were

2550
02:00:04,039 --> 02:00:09,289
probably from the stories I've read in

2551
02:00:06,829 --> 02:00:11,630
the Bible about this mana that was

2552
02:00:09,289 --> 02:00:15,260
available I think it was just mono wanna

2553
02:00:11,630 --> 02:00:17,930
and that the seeds were being used for

2554
02:00:15,260 --> 02:00:20,150
the oil and the leaves where are the

2555
02:00:17,930 --> 02:00:22,730
months the most nutritious things that

2556
02:00:20,149 --> 02:00:25,189
were available on earth and so that's

2557
02:00:22,729 --> 02:00:27,889
how we got this cannabinoid system in

2558
02:00:25,189 --> 02:00:30,379
our bodies from the day one whenever

2559
02:00:27,890 --> 02:00:32,060
that stuff was being the rock and now

2560
02:00:30,380 --> 02:00:34,400
it's now we're getting around to using

2561
02:00:32,060 --> 02:00:38,180
it as that was again but I'm pretty sure

2562
02:00:34,399 --> 02:00:41,019
that that's how it started off I want to

2563
02:00:38,180 --> 02:00:43,579
believe Indra that it conferred a

2564
02:00:41,020 --> 02:00:45,770
evolutionary benefit to any of the

2565
02:00:43,579 --> 02:00:48,920
tribes that might have been using it as

2566
02:00:45,770 --> 02:00:51,200
a food a portable food source rich in

2567
02:00:48,920 --> 02:00:54,079
protein rich in omega-3s which is brain

2568
02:00:51,199 --> 02:00:56,630
food and meantime the neuro protective

2569
02:00:54,079 --> 02:00:59,269
as well as antibacterial and antifungal

2570
02:00:56,630 --> 02:01:02,359
properties that we find in cannabis

2571
02:00:59,270 --> 02:01:04,850
probably conferred an evolutionary

2572
02:01:02,359 --> 02:01:07,009
advantage to the tribes that figured out

2573
02:01:04,850 --> 02:01:09,200
that cannabis might be a benefit to them

2574
02:01:07,010 --> 02:01:11,720
whether they were eating it or smoking

2575
02:01:09,199 --> 02:01:13,880
it meantime by carrying the seeds along

2576
02:01:11,720 --> 02:01:15,710
with them they probably dropped them in

2577
02:01:13,880 --> 02:01:17,600
some places and then saw them grow up

2578
02:01:15,710 --> 02:01:19,730
the next year in that new place and

2579
02:01:17,600 --> 02:01:26,090
maybe learned agriculture from it just

2580
02:01:19,729 --> 02:01:29,089
saying our whole entire system is based

2581
02:01:26,090 --> 02:01:31,310
off of so shows that evolutionally we

2582
02:01:29,090 --> 02:01:33,829
have you know totally grown together to

2583
02:01:31,310 --> 02:01:36,200
create a system in our body you know

2584
02:01:33,829 --> 02:01:38,180
that works with that plant so much and I

2585
02:01:36,199 --> 02:01:40,670
think that there's not a lot of examples

2586
02:01:38,180 --> 02:01:44,159
where humans with are willing to step up

2587
02:01:40,670 --> 02:01:47,069
for a plant like like we are for this

2588
02:01:44,159 --> 02:01:49,409
and also you know being humans on the

2589
02:01:47,069 --> 02:01:51,299
planet you know there's a lot of stress

2590
02:01:49,409 --> 02:01:53,460
involved there's no way that we can get

2591
02:01:51,300 --> 02:01:55,590
around stress we're a species that

2592
02:01:53,460 --> 02:01:58,079
creates stress whereas he sees that

2593
02:01:55,590 --> 02:02:01,140
brings in stress we're a species that

2594
02:01:58,079 --> 02:02:02,970
dissect stress and here's a plant that

2595
02:02:01,140 --> 02:02:06,150
can really help us with our stressful

2596
02:02:02,970 --> 02:02:09,240
lives and and I think that that it

2597
02:02:06,149 --> 02:02:11,549
really has a big play in our evolution

2598
02:02:09,239 --> 02:02:14,159
as far as human goes because as soon as

2599
02:02:11,550 --> 02:02:16,380
we are able to get rid of that stress

2600
02:02:14,159 --> 02:02:18,359
factor that's the way that we're able to

2601
02:02:16,380 --> 02:02:20,460
you know have a higher intelligence

2602
02:02:18,359 --> 02:02:22,889
that's how we're gonna be able to become

2603
02:02:20,460 --> 02:02:24,840
more biologically intelligent to the

2604
02:02:22,890 --> 02:02:26,460
planet and I believe that you know the

2605
02:02:24,840 --> 02:02:29,039
Mayans say that it's going to be the

2606
02:02:26,460 --> 02:02:30,840
flower that saves humanity I truly

2607
02:02:29,039 --> 02:02:33,569
believe that because it's gonna give us

2608
02:02:30,840 --> 02:02:35,400
different cloth patterns as well as

2609
02:02:33,569 --> 02:02:38,039
different types of body patterns that

2610
02:02:35,399 --> 02:02:40,139
help get rid of both you know emotional

2611
02:02:38,039 --> 02:02:42,960
and physical stress and if you believe

2612
02:02:40,140 --> 02:02:46,380
talk John Allegro might be Mahna Mahna

2613
02:02:42,960 --> 02:02:48,210
Juanes or Manas sila mana it might be

2614
02:02:46,380 --> 02:02:51,029
like there was some psilocybin in the

2615
02:02:48,210 --> 02:02:53,010
bread here I'm thinking well I'm pretty

2616
02:02:51,029 --> 02:02:54,960
sure that they way they found out that

2617
02:02:53,010 --> 02:02:57,000
everything makes you high was by putting

2618
02:02:54,960 --> 02:02:58,949
it in their mouth and trying it out and

2619
02:02:57,000 --> 02:03:03,359
then relating that experience to

2620
02:02:58,949 --> 02:03:05,760
somebody which is again the teaching how

2621
02:03:03,359 --> 02:03:08,460
powerful the teaching is because it had

2622
02:03:05,760 --> 02:03:10,470
to extend beyond those people and but

2623
02:03:08,460 --> 02:03:13,760
you were talking earlier about fractals

2624
02:03:10,470 --> 02:03:16,619
and I think our nervous systems and our

2625
02:03:13,760 --> 02:03:21,930
dynamic polite systems are fractal why

2626
02:03:16,619 --> 02:03:23,329
we so they need thing we can understand

2627
02:03:21,930 --> 02:03:27,150
so many different things

2628
02:03:23,329 --> 02:03:30,479
millions of little recesses and in the

2629
02:03:27,149 --> 02:03:35,069
mind that we're just learning to explore

2630
02:03:30,479 --> 02:03:38,309
them plant was here for some good I mean

2631
02:03:35,069 --> 02:03:41,429
it just you can't come up with an

2632
02:03:38,310 --> 02:03:44,880
explanation for why it's here but it's

2633
02:03:41,430 --> 02:03:50,090
here and it has persisted and I think

2634
02:03:44,880 --> 02:03:54,000
that persisted and so even persisted and

2635
02:03:50,090 --> 02:03:56,520
almost legal not quite yet we're still

2636
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:57,489
being looked at and held up for

2637
02:03:56,520 --> 02:04:01,540
examination

2638
02:03:57,489 --> 02:04:04,090
so forth but nonetheless it's back when

2639
02:04:01,539 --> 02:04:06,939
I started using it was completely

2640
02:04:04,090 --> 02:04:10,659
illegal even passing information out

2641
02:04:06,939 --> 02:04:14,649
about it was illegal and even in 98 when

2642
02:04:10,659 --> 02:04:18,449
I posted vho there was a lot of strange

2643
02:04:14,649 --> 02:04:22,239
energy around it and so I know that

2644
02:04:18,449 --> 02:04:24,760
authoritarians that we lived with don't

2645
02:04:22,239 --> 02:04:29,109
like us exercising the freedom of mine

2646
02:04:24,760 --> 02:04:31,510
that being on THC gives you it just

2647
02:04:29,109 --> 02:04:33,269
unlocks a bunch of doors you know places

2648
02:04:31,510 --> 02:04:36,789
that you might not have looked before

2649
02:04:33,270 --> 02:04:38,590
simply because we're prone to being

2650
02:04:36,789 --> 02:04:42,729
programmed I mean that's what they call

2651
02:04:38,590 --> 02:04:48,340
TV is programming I don't watch it but I

2652
02:04:42,729 --> 02:04:50,979
know it's a problem in the world for

2653
02:04:48,340 --> 02:04:55,180
real for real for real

2654
02:04:50,979 --> 02:04:55,179
[Music]

2655
02:04:55,739 --> 02:05:03,609
I was wondering from Daniel how you

2656
02:04:58,960 --> 02:05:05,289
liked your new pressure machine that you

2657
02:05:03,609 --> 02:05:07,149
had got you had taken some pictures that

2658
02:05:05,289 --> 02:05:09,489
I'm not too long ago how's how's all

2659
02:05:07,149 --> 02:05:13,269
that working out and how's whistler tech

2660
02:05:09,489 --> 02:05:16,029
doing well we're still waiting to to

2661
02:05:13,270 --> 02:05:17,380
test the machine the electricians are

2662
02:05:16,029 --> 02:05:19,239
supposed to install it next week and

2663
02:05:17,380 --> 02:05:21,159
then we have to wait we can do some dry

2664
02:05:19,239 --> 02:05:25,750
testing but we have to wait for Health

2665
02:05:21,159 --> 02:05:27,130
Canada approval to do the deed with with

2666
02:05:25,750 --> 02:05:30,430
cannabis but we've been doing the same

2667
02:05:27,130 --> 02:05:34,119
process just on kind of smaller vessels

2668
02:05:30,430 --> 02:05:36,490
that weren't custom-designed but the

2669
02:05:34,119 --> 02:05:38,380
technology is doing well we're we're

2670
02:05:36,489 --> 02:05:39,760
kind of just finishing off all the

2671
02:05:38,380 --> 02:05:41,710
research phase and all this equipment

2672
02:05:39,760 --> 02:05:47,530
and getting ready to to fully

2673
02:05:41,710 --> 02:05:50,739
commercialize it yeah that's exciting I

2674
02:05:47,529 --> 02:05:53,409
will be excited when we can compound and

2675
02:05:50,739 --> 02:05:55,750
need be able to use the herb with other

2676
02:05:53,409 --> 02:05:58,449
you know medicines and that's kind of

2677
02:05:55,750 --> 02:06:01,960
like what we feel is the true magic and

2678
02:05:58,449 --> 02:06:03,909
healing and we've even seen some patents

2679
02:06:01,960 --> 02:06:06,760
that have been given to us by family and

2680
02:06:03,909 --> 02:06:06,960
at one of the talks that we did that you

2681
02:06:06,760 --> 02:06:09,239
know

2682
02:06:06,960 --> 02:06:12,180
about how to cure prostate cancer and

2683
02:06:09,238 --> 02:06:14,729
you know using the the fungi and

2684
02:06:12,180 --> 02:06:16,380
everything together with with cannabis

2685
02:06:14,729 --> 02:06:18,209
and I just know that with Chinese

2686
02:06:16,380 --> 02:06:19,560
medicine and Ayurvedic medicine that it

2687
02:06:18,210 --> 02:06:22,170
would be really wonderful once we can

2688
02:06:19,560 --> 02:06:23,940
start putting the whole medicine

2689
02:06:22,170 --> 02:06:25,739
together because really I mean cannabis

2690
02:06:23,939 --> 02:06:28,349
is an island almost in a sense right now

2691
02:06:25,738 --> 02:06:30,529
in itself you know just being going

2692
02:06:28,350 --> 02:06:34,230
through this whole wringer of

2693
02:06:30,529 --> 02:06:35,309
legalization so yeah it's all process so

2694
02:06:34,229 --> 02:06:37,500
I guess we have to be good with the

2695
02:06:35,310 --> 02:06:40,170
journey but yeah and as much of it is it

2696
02:06:37,500 --> 02:06:42,270
is dr. Jenna Keeler to ourselves it's

2697
02:06:40,170 --> 02:06:42,869
also adaptogenic and its own plant

2698
02:06:42,270 --> 02:06:46,110
kingdom

2699
02:06:42,869 --> 02:06:48,539
you know cannabis has certain other

2700
02:06:46,109 --> 02:06:50,399
master plants that it likes to be

2701
02:06:48,539 --> 02:06:53,279
blended with that it likes to be grown

2702
02:06:50,399 --> 02:06:56,069
next to and if we're creating it as just

2703
02:06:53,279 --> 02:06:58,229
an island that we can't do different

2704
02:06:56,069 --> 02:06:59,880
Votan achill compounding with it then

2705
02:06:58,229 --> 02:07:02,759
you know we're really doing ourselves

2706
02:06:59,880 --> 02:07:05,550
and also the plan to huge just service

2707
02:07:02,760 --> 02:07:07,860
it's nice to be able to do all of these

2708
02:07:05,550 --> 02:07:10,320
isolates and all this distillates and a

2709
02:07:07,859 --> 02:07:12,238
lot of the the concentrates that we're

2710
02:07:10,319 --> 02:07:14,279
doing that's all wonderful and well and

2711
02:07:12,238 --> 02:07:18,029
good but there's a lot of other plants

2712
02:07:14,279 --> 02:07:21,329
that you know really should be coming in

2713
02:07:18,029 --> 02:07:23,789
its own you know concentrated value as

2714
02:07:21,329 --> 02:07:25,890
well yeah for sure

2715
02:07:23,789 --> 02:07:29,189
I mean my are my other venture is

2716
02:07:25,890 --> 02:07:32,880
Whistler therapeutics and that is about

2717
02:07:29,189 --> 02:07:35,488
taking the whole production of cannabis

2718
02:07:32,880 --> 02:07:37,109
and for medicinal purposes and looking

2719
02:07:35,488 --> 02:07:39,449
at the holistic perspective and that

2720
02:07:37,109 --> 02:07:41,420
your production of the plant has to be

2721
02:07:39,449 --> 02:07:44,699
helping the environment because we have

2722
02:07:41,420 --> 02:07:47,039
we're producing medicine today but then

2723
02:07:44,699 --> 02:07:48,599
it's made from oil and the entire

2724
02:07:47,039 --> 02:07:51,890
production process is releasing

2725
02:07:48,600 --> 02:07:55,230
pollutants and there's so much transport

2726
02:07:51,890 --> 02:07:57,239
so I mean medicine production isn't a

2727
02:07:55,229 --> 02:07:59,039
huge pollution compared to everything

2728
02:07:57,238 --> 02:08:01,109
else when it's part of the problems as

2729
02:07:59,039 --> 02:08:03,300
you say cannabis helps change change

2730
02:08:01,109 --> 02:08:04,889
people's perspective to realize that

2731
02:08:03,300 --> 02:08:06,869
they're being damaging to the

2732
02:08:04,890 --> 02:08:09,000
environment and also opens them up to

2733
02:08:06,869 --> 02:08:11,819
more you know plant healers and other

2734
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:14,488
things mushrooms are pretty fun it's

2735
02:08:11,819 --> 02:08:16,829
funny because in Canada mushrooms are

2736
02:08:14,488 --> 02:08:19,809
like the last unregulated frontier there

2737
02:08:16,829 --> 02:08:22,300
is no regulations for buying

2738
02:08:19,810 --> 02:08:25,450
or selling wild mushrooms which can be

2739
02:08:22,300 --> 02:08:27,699
hallucinogenic and Artic controls like

2740
02:08:25,449 --> 02:08:30,069
the Amanita of mushrooms or incredibly

2741
02:08:27,699 --> 02:08:31,539
toxic so you're legally allowed to buy

2742
02:08:30,069 --> 02:08:34,359
death care or pick Death Cap mushrooms

2743
02:08:31,539 --> 02:08:36,039
and sell them to someone else but we

2744
02:08:34,359 --> 02:08:38,049
need all this strict regulation on

2745
02:08:36,039 --> 02:08:39,760
cannabis to protect the children but

2746
02:08:38,050 --> 02:08:42,010
it's just the market the size is so

2747
02:08:39,760 --> 02:08:44,530
large that they need that regulation but

2748
02:08:42,010 --> 02:08:47,829
I think that you're right about you know

2749
02:08:44,529 --> 02:08:49,659
we're gonna have a lot more plant

2750
02:08:47,829 --> 02:08:52,090
partners or fungi partners that are

2751
02:08:49,659 --> 02:08:54,130
gonna help us out these are some a pair

2752
02:08:52,090 --> 02:08:55,630
of matsutake mushrooms I found that have

2753
02:08:54,130 --> 02:08:57,850
this heart in the center and they're

2754
02:08:55,630 --> 02:09:00,100
permanently bonded together which you

2755
02:08:57,850 --> 02:09:02,410
often don't see with with the pine

2756
02:09:00,100 --> 02:09:06,070
mushrooms so that was that I really

2757
02:09:02,409 --> 02:09:07,899
interested foul fine but um I think you

2758
02:09:06,069 --> 02:09:10,779
know the plants have a lot to teach us

2759
02:09:07,899 --> 02:09:12,639
about how we can heal ourselves and heal

2760
02:09:10,779 --> 02:09:15,219
the planet and more so especially the

2761
02:09:12,640 --> 02:09:17,079
mushrooms are so good at bringing the

2762
02:09:15,220 --> 02:09:20,199
planet back into balance after a

2763
02:09:17,079 --> 02:09:22,059
disturbance so humans go out and destroy

2764
02:09:20,199 --> 02:09:23,590
a forest and cut it down and the

2765
02:09:22,060 --> 02:09:25,300
mushrooms and the other trees work

2766
02:09:23,590 --> 02:09:28,150
together to bring that that ecosystem

2767
02:09:25,300 --> 02:09:30,789
back so looking at how we can integrate

2768
02:09:28,149 --> 02:09:32,949
our production of medicines into the

2769
02:09:30,789 --> 02:09:35,079
natural cycles of the earth is gonna is

2770
02:09:32,949 --> 02:09:39,729
gonna bring us forward and you know more

2771
02:09:35,079 --> 02:09:41,890
in tune with what we need to do which

2772
02:09:39,729 --> 02:09:44,109
really brings us into the work that

2773
02:09:41,890 --> 02:09:48,310
we're doing as far as seeing this up as

2774
02:09:44,109 --> 02:09:49,659
an opportunity to let small farms heal

2775
02:09:48,310 --> 02:09:51,700
the earth you know I mean there is

2776
02:09:49,659 --> 02:09:53,949
corporate farming out there and that's a

2777
02:09:51,699 --> 02:09:55,840
thing and it's whatever but you know

2778
02:09:53,949 --> 02:09:58,090
it's the small farms and things that

2779
02:09:55,840 --> 02:10:00,909
have the opportunity to reach a farm

2780
02:09:58,090 --> 02:10:04,449
regenerative Li and to take care of the

2781
02:10:00,909 --> 02:10:06,309
land and we're coming up to the Emerald

2782
02:10:04,449 --> 02:10:09,399
cup and there's a lot of really amazing

2783
02:10:06,310 --> 02:10:10,600
farms that you know will be highlighted

2784
02:10:09,399 --> 02:10:12,879
at the Emerald cup through the

2785
02:10:10,600 --> 02:10:15,970
regenerative farm award and there's

2786
02:10:12,880 --> 02:10:17,890
other Institute's like the resource

2787
02:10:15,970 --> 02:10:21,130
innovation Institute out of Portland

2788
02:10:17,890 --> 02:10:23,680
which analyzes grows with their

2789
02:10:21,130 --> 02:10:27,250
electrical output and their water output

2790
02:10:23,680 --> 02:10:31,210
and has come up with a way to measure

2791
02:10:27,250 --> 02:10:32,859
you know how how efficient they are as a

2792
02:10:31,210 --> 02:10:33,609
business and we think that that's really

2793
02:10:32,859 --> 02:10:36,399
valuable

2794
02:10:33,609 --> 02:10:38,289
and I think that it even even you know

2795
02:10:36,399 --> 02:10:40,659
getting down to the very root the root

2796
02:10:38,289 --> 02:10:43,239
the root of it all is that you know we

2797
02:10:40,659 --> 02:10:45,849
know that we're losing 90 percent of the

2798
02:10:43,239 --> 02:10:49,899
species on the planet and that so that

2799
02:10:45,850 --> 02:10:52,660
doesn't disclude one giant bacteria that

2800
02:10:49,899 --> 02:10:54,519
also means sure we're losing 90 percent

2801
02:10:52,659 --> 02:10:57,069
of the large species on the planet but

2802
02:10:54,520 --> 02:10:59,740
we're also losing 90 percent of the very

2803
02:10:57,069 --> 02:11:01,509
very small species on the planet and if

2804
02:10:59,739 --> 02:11:03,670
we start forgetting about what gives us

2805
02:11:01,510 --> 02:11:05,949
true intelligence which is from nature

2806
02:11:03,670 --> 02:11:08,140
which is the fungi and the bacteria and

2807
02:11:05,949 --> 02:11:10,239
if we're starting to lose all of that

2808
02:11:08,140 --> 02:11:12,190
and it is more important than ever to

2809
02:11:10,239 --> 02:11:14,050
bring back the small farmer because the

2810
02:11:12,189 --> 02:11:18,069
small farms are going to be able to host

2811
02:11:14,050 --> 02:11:21,070
this biologically intelligent biome that

2812
02:11:18,069 --> 02:11:23,500
holds all of these species and brings in

2813
02:11:21,069 --> 02:11:27,039
larger amounts of species so it's almost

2814
02:11:23,500 --> 02:11:29,829
like you know creating some kind of a

2815
02:11:27,039 --> 02:11:32,229
foundation to protect all of these

2816
02:11:29,829 --> 02:11:34,539
important species that are on the planet

2817
02:11:32,229 --> 02:11:36,609
and I believe that this is our

2818
02:11:34,539 --> 02:11:39,279
intelligence and the more that we

2819
02:11:36,609 --> 02:11:41,380
cultivate this plant in a natural

2820
02:11:39,279 --> 02:11:44,619
process is the more that we're gonna be

2821
02:11:41,380 --> 02:11:48,430
able to get out of it you guys go up oh

2822
02:11:44,619 --> 02:11:51,789
yeah yes we'll have our tea be there

2823
02:11:48,430 --> 02:11:53,530
we're gonna be doing some panels there

2824
02:11:51,789 --> 02:11:56,680
and working at the regenerative

2825
02:11:53,529 --> 02:11:59,079
agriculture lounge and stuff so yeah if

2826
02:11:56,680 --> 02:12:02,710
you're gonna be there be fun to meet and

2827
02:11:59,079 --> 02:12:04,359
hang out and etienne and anyone else I

2828
02:12:02,710 --> 02:12:06,430
know marks coming down we're gonna see

2829
02:12:04,359 --> 02:12:08,349
Wade and you know a lot of the lot of

2830
02:12:06,430 --> 02:12:12,000
these good family members here really

2831
02:12:08,350 --> 02:12:12,000
what about you Daniel you coming down

2832
02:12:13,739 --> 02:12:20,050
not this time but uh I'm gonna be pretty

2833
02:12:17,979 --> 02:12:21,789
busy up here for a while but I'm looking

2834
02:12:20,050 --> 02:12:24,130
forward to being able to travel around

2835
02:12:21,789 --> 02:12:26,170
more I wanted to go back what you're

2836
02:12:24,130 --> 02:12:28,840
saying just a minute ago and add in that

2837
02:12:26,170 --> 02:12:30,609
I think the cannabis from a medical

2838
02:12:28,840 --> 02:12:32,529
perspective is bringing you know

2839
02:12:30,609 --> 02:12:33,789
somewhat of a democratization of

2840
02:12:32,529 --> 02:12:35,679
medicine rather than having these

2841
02:12:33,789 --> 02:12:38,019
pharmaceutical companies that have to be

2842
02:12:35,680 --> 02:12:40,150
you know clinical trials are really good

2843
02:12:38,020 --> 02:12:42,100
and powerful but everything everybody's

2844
02:12:40,149 --> 02:12:44,170
put in the same box and everything has

2845
02:12:42,100 --> 02:12:46,000
to be such a large production that

2846
02:12:44,170 --> 02:12:47,829
rather than finding if

2847
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:49,750
medicines that work well for small

2848
02:12:47,829 --> 02:12:52,149
populations we're going to find whatever

2849
02:12:49,750 --> 02:12:54,399
one works best for the average and when

2850
02:12:52,149 --> 02:12:56,079
you have small farm cannabis production

2851
02:12:54,399 --> 02:12:58,119
on the medical side well you're just

2852
02:12:56,079 --> 02:13:00,309
servicing the community and who's going

2853
02:12:58,119 --> 02:13:02,380
to be able to better provide the

2854
02:13:00,310 --> 02:13:04,150
medicines that that community needs and

2855
02:13:02,380 --> 02:13:05,770
someone who's right there and can talk

2856
02:13:04,149 --> 02:13:07,899
to those patients and know what the

2857
02:13:05,770 --> 02:13:09,910
problems are there so then you don't

2858
02:13:07,899 --> 02:13:12,099
have all the transport and all that

2859
02:13:09,909 --> 02:13:13,420
waste that we have with these large

2860
02:13:12,100 --> 02:13:15,400
systems and that's what you're seeing

2861
02:13:13,420 --> 02:13:18,060
with Medical Marijuana right you have

2862
02:13:15,399 --> 02:13:21,849
these local dispensaries and production

2863
02:13:18,060 --> 02:13:25,539
so I think that the really large

2864
02:13:21,850 --> 02:13:28,329
companies are you know I I don't hope

2865
02:13:25,539 --> 02:13:31,149
that's gonna be the the main way I think

2866
02:13:28,329 --> 02:13:33,130
that small-scale local production where

2867
02:13:31,149 --> 02:13:34,809
as you say we spread the knowledge to

2868
02:13:33,130 --> 02:13:36,520
everyone else and they can do it within

2869
02:13:34,810 --> 02:13:37,600
their own community and service their

2870
02:13:36,520 --> 02:13:41,080
own needs

2871
02:13:37,600 --> 02:13:44,320
we don't need massive mega producers per

2872
02:13:41,079 --> 02:13:45,519
se that are gonna supply everybody with

2873
02:13:44,319 --> 02:13:47,769
the same thing and then every

2874
02:13:45,520 --> 02:13:49,300
everything's made according to the

2875
02:13:47,770 --> 02:13:51,640
economics of where it's being

2876
02:13:49,300 --> 02:13:54,369
distributed and it's really easy you

2877
02:13:51,640 --> 02:13:56,289
know the technology we're developing can

2878
02:13:54,369 --> 02:13:57,849
be applied anywhere in the world really

2879
02:13:56,289 --> 02:14:00,220
and it's simple and it's environmentally

2880
02:13:57,850 --> 02:14:02,620
friendly and you can set up for not very

2881
02:14:00,220 --> 02:14:05,050
much money a pretty robust you know

2882
02:14:02,619 --> 02:14:08,590
medical cannabis system and you anywhere

2883
02:14:05,050 --> 02:14:11,050
people need it and that's really what

2884
02:14:08,590 --> 02:14:13,750
brought this whole thing to legalization

2885
02:14:11,050 --> 02:14:15,670
to begin with was the medicinal aspects

2886
02:14:13,750 --> 02:14:19,180
of it and if you're in Canada

2887
02:14:15,670 --> 02:14:21,399
John Conroy is a cannabis lawyer in

2888
02:14:19,180 --> 02:14:24,310
Vancouver who really is you know one of

2889
02:14:21,399 --> 02:14:27,279
our main people that's helping us keep

2890
02:14:24,310 --> 02:14:29,289
our medical abilities in Canada and we

2891
02:14:27,279 --> 02:14:31,389
really you know support him and that

2892
02:14:29,289 --> 02:14:33,100
whole group in every way and I also

2893
02:14:31,390 --> 02:14:35,079
wonder about mark if you know anything

2894
02:14:33,100 --> 02:14:38,590
about you know just the exploration of

2895
02:14:35,079 --> 02:14:40,750
endo Finnick fungi within the plant and

2896
02:14:38,590 --> 02:14:42,340
what you know how they play a role with

2897
02:14:40,750 --> 02:14:43,689
medicine and how that's that's not

2898
02:14:42,340 --> 02:14:46,029
really something you hear a lot about

2899
02:14:43,689 --> 02:14:48,009
and they're and we'll be able to for the

2900
02:14:46,029 --> 02:14:50,259
very first time because we're federally

2901
02:14:48,010 --> 02:14:52,989
legal in Canada we'll be able to

2902
02:14:50,260 --> 02:14:56,619
actually have the ability for people

2903
02:14:52,989 --> 02:14:59,710
that have scientific licenses to be able

2904
02:14:56,619 --> 02:15:04,000
to study you know soil grow

2905
02:14:59,710 --> 02:15:06,489
fungi inspired bacterial grown cannabis

2906
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:08,920
for the very first time and I'm

2907
02:15:06,489 --> 02:15:10,599
wondering yeah mark what do you think

2908
02:15:08,920 --> 02:15:12,010
about that do you think that we're going

2909
02:15:10,600 --> 02:15:15,520
to be able to step a little bit further

2910
02:15:12,010 --> 02:15:20,289
into understanding the plant and its

2911
02:15:15,520 --> 02:15:25,630
uptake through its natural cycles bond

2912
02:15:20,289 --> 02:15:26,640
written you mean e mark or him Marcus no

02:16:11,470 --> 02:16:24,420
in the comments and we all do one you

2928
02:16:14,590 --> 02:16:27,489
know what's up I've got told cherry pie

2929
02:16:24,420 --> 02:16:29,050
does anybody know about it anything

2930
02:16:27,489 --> 02:16:33,069
behind it or anything like that I heard

2931
02:16:29,050 --> 02:16:34,930
it's an OG cross with with rod it's

2932
02:16:33,069 --> 02:16:36,670
called pi breath what I have now it's an

2933
02:16:34,930 --> 02:16:38,290
OG cross with a cherry pie does anybody

2934
02:16:36,670 --> 02:16:41,020
know the lineage on any of that sort of

2935
02:16:38,290 --> 02:16:45,940
stuff like the cherry pie thing part of

2936
02:16:41,020 --> 02:16:48,399
it we've definitely grown it and done it

2937
02:16:45,940 --> 02:16:51,340
done a bunch of different blends of it

2938
02:16:48,399 --> 02:16:53,409
but I've heard that it's a no G cross

2939
02:16:51,340 --> 02:16:55,479
for sure and wondering that breaths is

2940
02:16:53,409 --> 02:16:57,399
either am endo breath or hogs breath in

2941
02:16:55,479 --> 02:16:59,920
there which is always really nice it's a

2942
02:16:57,399 --> 02:17:01,959
thug pug that's what I know about it I

2943
02:16:59,920 --> 02:17:05,440
went and met Turk crusher from Instagram

2944
02:17:01,959 --> 02:17:07,059
and he had all these thug pug cultivars

2945
02:17:05,440 --> 02:17:09,520
and apparently the guy has some good

2946
02:17:07,059 --> 02:17:11,609
abilities of selecting I saw a lot of

2947
02:17:09,520 --> 02:17:14,739
the different varieties and it was

2948
02:17:11,610 --> 02:17:16,600
it looked good it was it was good I

2949
02:17:14,739 --> 02:17:18,520
think you've got some kind of an

2950
02:17:16,600 --> 02:17:20,680
original Durbin poison in there too

2951
02:17:18,520 --> 02:17:23,680
I'm not really sure but love to hear

2952
02:17:20,680 --> 02:17:25,600
about that well I'm really enjoying it

2953
02:17:23,680 --> 02:17:27,430
I'm squishing some you know some

2954
02:17:25,600 --> 02:17:31,239
personal drawers and out of it not sort

2955
02:17:27,430 --> 02:17:33,610
of stop it it's tasty very tasty I like

2956
02:17:31,239 --> 02:17:35,619
it a lot and I'm glad I got to grow it

2957
02:17:33,610 --> 02:17:40,270
we did it from seed we've had it going

2958
02:17:35,620 --> 02:17:42,730
for both a year now we're fifth stage of

2959
02:17:40,270 --> 02:17:44,319
budding it off real nice and everything

2960
02:17:42,729 --> 02:17:48,399
and seeing when it's true potential is I

2961
02:17:44,319 --> 02:17:49,239
like it so cherry pie breath long

2962
02:17:48,399 --> 02:17:56,799
written more than others

2963
02:17:49,239 --> 02:18:02,289
let's do it we a grateful breath cherry

2964
02:17:56,799 --> 02:18:03,969
puffs and that was from the that's from

2965
02:18:02,290 --> 02:18:06,070
the mend Oh breath - which is a gauge

2966
02:18:03,969 --> 02:18:09,459
Green strange but we got it through

2967
02:18:06,069 --> 02:18:12,209
mister spliff and yeah I've got amazing

2968
02:18:09,459 --> 02:18:15,039
flavor and it's a blue style plant

2969
02:18:12,209 --> 02:18:17,919
bluish dark plant with like a super

2970
02:18:15,040 --> 02:18:22,420
silvery trichome on it and it has a

2971
02:18:17,920 --> 02:18:24,489
really fuel --is-- kind of humulin syrup

2972
02:18:22,420 --> 02:18:27,760
inyline kind of flavor to it like the

2973
02:18:24,489 --> 02:18:30,129
kind of diesel dog flavor to it it's

2974
02:18:27,760 --> 02:18:35,969
it's really really awesome great yield

2975
02:18:30,129 --> 02:18:39,159
er - how about pre-soviet heads -

2976
02:18:35,969 --> 02:18:42,340
pre-soviet Petrolia heads - cross

2977
02:18:39,159 --> 02:18:43,959
Kandahar I've got these seeds I started

2978
02:18:42,340 --> 02:18:46,239
two of them off just to see what they do

2979
02:18:43,959 --> 02:18:49,599
there's supposed to be like a 80 90 day

2980
02:18:46,239 --> 02:18:53,129
finisher but does anybody know anything

2981
02:18:49,600 --> 02:18:55,470
about that one you ever heard of it no

2982
02:18:53,129 --> 02:18:59,559
I'm fascinated by it

2983
02:18:55,469 --> 02:19:02,199
yeah well the name of it of just like

2984
02:18:59,559 --> 02:19:05,199
come on like you know my dog my little

2985

dog is a Russian spat nanba Lankan Shih

2986
02:19:05,200 --> 02:19:09,190
Tzu I never believed the lady that I

2987
02:19:07,450 --> 02:19:11,530
bought it off but that was actually her

2988
02:19:09,190 --> 02:19:14,020
heritage until I wanted to breed her I

2989
02:19:11,530 --> 02:19:16,840
want to find a mate for her and all I

2990
02:19:14,020 --> 02:19:18,430
could find was these big large 15 to 20

2991
02:19:16,840 --> 02:19:21,460
pound shih tzus she's an eight pound

2992
02:19:18,430 --> 02:19:23,479
little dog she is an actual Russian spit

2993
02:19:21,459 --> 02:19:25,969
named Blanc and Shih Tzu she's

2994
02:19:23,479 --> 02:19:31,010
the whole name which is weird but this

2995
02:19:25,969 --> 02:19:33,109
Russian the pre-soviet Petrolia

2996
02:19:31,010 --> 02:19:35,809
headstocks cross Kandahar is what this

2997
02:19:33,110 --> 02:19:37,850
is called and I got it from a guy that

2998
02:19:35,809 --> 02:19:40,250
really I got it from the same guy I got

2999
02:19:37,850 --> 02:19:44,091
the cherry put the pie breath from so

3000
02:19:40,250 --> 02:19:50,569
I'm really really curious that three

3001
02:19:44,091 --> 02:19:53,021
Soviets that means 70 that's uh huh well

3002
02:19:50,569 --> 02:20:09,110
they talked up really nice my question

3003
02:19:53,021 --> 02:20:12,079
isn't Tom did it mop up Tommy or okay

3004
02:20:09,110 --> 02:20:13,601
okay cool well I'll keep you all up to

3005
02:20:12,079 --> 02:20:17,271
date on it anyways

3006
02:20:13,601 --> 02:20:22,011
does the Soviet thing I mean not so

3007
02:20:17,271 --> 02:20:25,011
large I mean there's the genetics the

3008
02:20:22,011 --> 02:20:27,681
autoflowering ruderalis genetics come

3009
02:20:25,011 --> 02:20:31,540
from siberia you know and then there's

3010
02:20:27,681 --> 02:20:34,790
also like CBD hemp fish cultivars from

3011
02:20:31,540 --> 02:20:36,440
Uzbekistan and over in the other you

3012
02:20:34,790 --> 02:20:38,120
know East you know western parts of

3013
02:20:36,440 --> 02:20:39,950
Russia so it's and when you say

3014
02:20:38,120 --> 02:20:41,841
pre-soviet it'd be really hard to know

3015
02:20:39,950 --> 02:20:47,120
why would for some reason think it might

3016
02:20:41,841 --> 02:20:49,819
be taller but well uh you know they're

3017
02:20:47,120 --> 02:20:52,221
both this tall right now that's it

3018
02:20:49,819 --> 02:20:57,770
they're just little babies so there's

3019
02:20:52,220 --> 02:21:00,050
this little are they widely yes yeah

3020
02:20:57,771 --> 02:21:06,530
they're they're Afghan and they're

3021
02:21:00,050 --> 02:21:08,960
pretty Soviet asan the pod breath it

3022
02:21:06,530 --> 02:21:11,271
wants to get in veg it wants to be in

3023
02:21:08,960 --> 02:21:14,869
but it's got the little the little balls

3024
02:21:11,271 --> 02:21:17,391
not the balls the the little pods the

3025
02:21:14,870 --> 02:21:20,480
seat not the seed stuff but we're you

3026
02:21:17,390 --> 02:21:22,850
know the little little bud correlation

3027
02:21:20,479 --> 02:21:26,091
there they build up it's like it always

3028
02:21:22,851 --> 02:21:27,801
wants to be in but even in veg it's got

3029
02:21:26,091 --> 02:21:30,200
the little cowlick hairs on and stuff

3030
02:21:27,800 --> 02:21:32,180
like that it's it's pretty good I like

3031
02:21:30,200 --> 02:21:34,369
it maybe it has some root maybe not some

3032
02:21:32,181 --> 02:21:41,020
of that ruderalis it might be

3033
02:21:34,369 --> 02:21:41,020
you know I don't know but I like it nice

3034
02:21:41,978 --> 02:21:56,799
brutal

3035
02:21:43,340 --> 02:22:01,189
it's just means roadside right Sam but

3036
02:21:56,799 --> 02:22:03,828
yeah but the reason people like Marie

3037
02:22:01,189 --> 02:22:18,770
rouse is because there's a lot of from

3038
02:22:03,828 --> 02:22:21,828
the far north with Your Honor we liked

3039
02:22:18,770 --> 02:22:24,069
it up here in the north and BC because

3040
02:22:21,828 --> 02:22:26,658
of our summers are shorter right and

3041
02:22:24,068 --> 02:22:27,799
they just seemed as soon as it started

3042
02:22:26,658 --> 02:22:30,618
to get rootbound

3043
02:22:27,799 --> 02:22:32,688
they just bud right off so it they did

3044
02:22:30,619 --> 02:22:47,899
that in July sometime they finished off

3045
02:22:32,689 --> 02:22:50,328
in September and we're okay good to know

3046
02:22:47,898 --> 02:22:52,358
like we grew a lot of those in our

3047
02:22:50,328 --> 02:22:55,398
outdoor genetics and British Columbia

3048
02:22:52,359 --> 02:22:56,899
back in the day you get throwbacks of

3049
02:22:55,398 --> 02:22:59,510
the ruderalis and they were definitely

3050
02:22:56,898 --> 02:23:02,148
better for hash I would say a lot of

3051
02:22:59,510 --> 02:23:05,540
times they made like a really kind of a

3052
02:23:02,148 --> 02:23:07,849
full furry top you know where it was

3053
02:23:05,540 --> 02:23:09,529
like a lion's mane or so I mean who

3054
02:23:07,850 --> 02:23:12,170
knows what you know what else you could

3055
02:23:09,529 --> 02:23:14,238
say but it was definitely not like a bud

3056
02:23:12,170 --> 02:23:16,658
in the same way I thought that's what we

3057
02:23:14,238 --> 02:23:23,299
found within ours

3058
02:23:16,658 --> 02:23:25,340
literally no THC ruderalis they have a

3059
02:23:23,299 --> 02:23:30,060
lot of brands but it doesn't it's not

3060
02:23:25,340 --> 02:23:31,681
high tea at all is it

3061
02:23:30,060 --> 02:23:34,591
can any type of cannabinoid that you

3062
02:23:31,681 --> 02:23:36,659
know of like should we be breeding you

3063
02:23:34,591 --> 02:23:40,829
know and working listen all to bring in

3064
02:23:36,659 --> 02:23:44,729
it cannot me it has more CBD CDC maybe

3065
02:23:40,829 --> 02:23:48,229
some TV or things like that but it's not

3066
02:23:44,729 --> 02:23:51,119
particularly high it's not even

3067
02:23:48,229 --> 02:23:55,939
particularly high in any of those

3068
02:23:51,120 --> 02:23:59,131
for example sobriety to tap away Auto is

3069
02:23:55,940 --> 02:24:02,971
vanilla which is grown in Canada I think

3070
02:23:59,130 --> 02:24:08,010
it's the largest seat reducing variety

3071
02:24:02,970 --> 02:24:12,600
growing area and for NOLA it will start

3072
02:24:08,011 --> 02:24:15,690
flowering pretty much in even under long

3073
02:24:12,601 --> 02:24:21,620
walk or you know the early summer

3074
02:24:15,690 --> 02:24:24,149
whereas finishes smiling though whereas

3075
02:24:21,620 --> 02:24:26,490
Rockstar cloud and they never really

3076
02:24:24,149 --> 02:24:28,859
finished flowering to life support to

3077
02:24:26,489 --> 02:24:33,171
like older the environment and their

3078
02:24:28,860 --> 02:24:33,171
word photo period doesn't make them stop

3079
02:24:36,501 --> 02:24:46,560
hours a box I wanted to mention maybe

3080
02:24:43,890 --> 02:24:49,409
just because I will forget otherwise but

3081
02:24:46,560 --> 02:24:53,909
my friend James just reminded me that

3082
02:24:49,409 --> 02:24:57,001
they have a new their first episode is

3083
02:24:53,909 --> 02:25:00,030
coming out highlighting the CPS work by

3084
02:24:57,001 --> 02:25:01,710
Sol on outreach in Victoria friend of

3085
02:25:00,030 --> 02:25:04,051
mine Jack Phillips is a big part of that

3086
02:25:01,710 --> 02:25:06,960
he's helped and run it and it's all

3087
02:25:04,050 --> 02:25:09,029
about giving cannabis to to people who

3088
02:25:06,960 --> 02:25:10,829
are opioid dependent and people who are

3089
02:25:09,030 --> 02:25:12,870
out on the streets they give away many

3090
02:25:10,829 --> 02:25:16,050
many many hundreds of packages every

3091
02:25:12,870 --> 02:25:20,041
month and his episodes coming out on

series and they did it at Salome's event

3096
02:25:30,720 --> 02:25:34,350
actually that you guys had the booth

3097

02:27:26,389 --> 02:27:31,849
plant is all about so you know farmers

3142
02:27:28,939 --> 02:27:36,069
who have excess flour please donate it

3143
02:27:31,850 --> 02:27:40,430
to khalad reyes network well I have five

3144
02:27:36,069 --> 02:27:43,909
gallons of co2

3145
02:27:40,430 --> 02:27:47,710
JPD extract from my amp player and it

3146
02:27:43,909 --> 02:27:51,559
came with all the labs on it that's

3147
02:27:47,709 --> 02:27:53,179
0.01% of 0.03 or whatever THC in the

3148
02:27:51,559 --> 02:27:55,698
rest of it is

3149
02:27:53,180 --> 02:27:56,750
that and I've extracted some out of that

3150
02:27:55,699 --> 02:28:00,050
because as you know you're gonna

3151
02:27:56,750 --> 02:28:02,629
winterize it after co2 extraction which

3152
02:28:00,049 --> 02:28:05,209
is a huge joke but anyway it went rise a

3153
02:28:02,629 --> 02:28:08,329
bunch of it and it's a very good stuff

3154
02:28:05,209 --> 02:28:10,789
it's red as red can be quartz Hammond

3155
02:28:08,329 --> 02:28:13,398
distilled it because nothing I hate

3156
02:28:10,790 --> 02:28:16,340
worse than applying heat to something to

3157
02:28:13,398 --> 02:28:19,340
purify it yeah I mean you can get a

3158
02:28:16,340 --> 02:28:21,590
skeleton out of a cow too

3159
02:28:19,340 --> 02:28:24,859
I guess that's purification of sorts to

3160
02:28:21,590 --> 02:28:28,670
a I don't know I don't eat cows so I am

3161
02:28:24,859 --> 02:28:32,000
and I'm not one to comment on that but I

3162
02:28:28,670 --> 02:28:33,978

3163

3177
02:29:12,020 --> 02:29:20,449
45 acre spot the Moto River runs along

3178
02:29:17,299 --> 02:29:22,398
the edge of it the Moto Indian tribe is

3179
02:29:20,449 --> 02:29:24,170
across the river then on Friday and

3180
02:29:22,398 --> 02:29:27,049
Saturday night so it's not too cold or

3181
02:29:24,170 --> 02:29:31,609
in climate they chant and drum which is

3182
02:29:27,049 --> 02:29:34,309
pretty cosmic and it sounds awesome 300

3183
02:29:31,609 --> 02:29:36,859
foot tall trees all around the house and

3184
02:29:34,309 --> 02:29:39,139
this land was never logged because it

3185
02:29:36,859 --> 02:29:41,568
was too close to the Indian Reservation

3186
02:29:39,139 --> 02:29:43,278
so they left it alone right out the

3187
02:29:41,568 --> 02:29:46,278
front door I've got three hundred sixty

3188
02:29:43,279 --> 02:29:49,010
nine foot tall redwood and it's very

3189
02:29:46,279 --> 02:29:52,100
commanding and it's very quiet spot I

3190
02:29:49,010 --> 02:29:53,840
mean the nearest neighbor I suppose if

3191
02:29:52,100 --> 02:29:56,149
you had to eat would throw a hammer over

3192
02:29:53,840 --> 02:29:57,889
there if you're really strong but

3193
02:29:56,148 --> 02:30:02,948
they're about a thousand feet away

3194
02:29:57,889 --> 02:30:02,948
otherwise it's quiet it's

3195
02:30:03,079 --> 02:30:07,370

02:30:56,149 --> 02:31:01,609
open to visitors because it's just me

3216
02:30:58,819 --> 02:31:03,379
the Chihuahua and Roby my parent would

3217
02:31:01,610 --> 02:31:07,069
just laid three eggs on my pillow a

3218
02:31:03,379 --> 02:31:10,099
couple nights ago I'm gonna looks like

3219
02:31:07,069 --> 02:31:15,560
I'm going to ask some other parrots but

3220
02:31:10,100 --> 02:31:22,239
yeah it's quiet nice and plays awesome

3221
02:31:15,560 --> 02:31:22,239
yes I've got some some this right here

3222
02:31:22,450 --> 02:31:30,700
Rasen I've got 40 grams of it and it is

3223
02:31:27,069 --> 02:31:33,979
it's this tangerine so nerdy slow cross

3224
02:31:30,700 --> 02:31:36,561
snorts people we were just [ __ ] on

3225
02:31:33,979 --> 02:31:38,899
some sour tangi that was grown here in

3226
02:31:36,560 --> 02:31:41,329
town that's just like really beautiful

3227
02:31:38,899 --> 02:31:48,859
straight but now that you show us that

3228
02:31:41,329 --> 02:31:52,340
we're for sure I don't know what the

3229
02:31:48,860 --> 02:31:54,800
glass because like Sam you know the road

3230
02:31:52,340 --> 02:31:58,909
to doing Deb's it's covered in broken

3231
02:31:54,799 --> 02:32:01,129
glass so make sure you bring along a

3232
02:31:58,909 --> 02:32:03,139
dabbing right that's that's why it's

3233
02:32:01,129 --> 02:32:05,000
important to just buy like a five or a

3234
02:32:03,139 --> 02:32:08,119
ten thousand dollar pipe so you're just

3235
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:10,250
very very careful with it and you take

3236
02:32:08,120 --> 02:32:12,140
good care to not break it we're gonna

3237
02:32:10,250 --> 02:32:14,659
get we'll get one of those from little

3238
02:32:12,139 --> 02:32:14,909
Bobby Snodgrass yeah we're a noise when

3239
02:32:14,659 --> 02:32:16,170
you

3240
02:32:14,909 --> 02:32:18,299
when you're going to be traveling with a

3241
02:32:16,170 --> 02:32:20,670
Snodgrass clan so we'll be coming with

3242
02:32:18,299 --> 02:32:22,770
glass and tow for sure for real yeah

3243
02:32:20,670 --> 02:32:24,780
it's not grass families coming to the

3244
02:32:22,771 --> 02:32:29,820
Emerald count too this year so and I'll

3245
02:32:24,780 --> 02:32:33,690
I I do I somebody broke my last one I

3246
02:32:29,819 --> 02:32:37,860
need a study in my collection badly okay

3247
02:32:33,690 --> 02:32:40,200
a fantastic pipe but I keep it wrapped

3248
02:32:37,860 --> 02:32:44,040
up and put away because the last time I

3249
02:32:40,200 --> 02:32:46,290
had it out put me with it

3250
02:32:44,040 --> 02:32:48,440
they literally dropped it if it wasn't

3251
02:32:46,290 --> 02:32:53,490
for my superior hand-eye coordination

3252
02:32:48,440 --> 02:32:56,760
that card it so I don't bring it on

3253
02:32:53,489 --> 02:32:58,739
anymore except for Malone they know that

3254
02:32:56,760 --> 02:33:02,610
I'm not gonna break it please that

3255
02:32:58,739 --> 02:33:05,640
relatively sure this year there's the

3256
02:33:02,610 --> 02:33:07,980
Bob Snodgrass award so the Emerald cup

3257
02:33:05,640 --> 02:33:09,989
is instilling a Bob Snodgrass award

3258
02:33:07,979 --> 02:33:11,670
they're gonna be there at the very front

3259
02:33:09,989 --> 02:33:13,351
of the hall of flowers they're going to

3260
02:33:11,670 --> 02:33:15,271

3264
02:33:21,060 --> 02:33:26,190
speaking this year and stuff as she's

3265
02:33:23,280 --> 02:33:28,710
super excited and yeah we're just really

3266
02:33:26,190 --> 02:33:29,670
excited to link up with the family and

3267
02:33:28,709 --> 02:33:32,189
have a good time

3268
02:33:29,670 --> 02:33:42,030
Grateful Dead families you know hanging

3269
02:33:32,190 --> 02:33:44,700
hanging tough they're still on it I like

3270
02:33:42,030 --> 02:33:46,710
any drew that for them in their kitchen

3271
02:33:44,700 --> 02:33:49,920
on the pieces of a Grateful Dead

3272
02:33:46,709 --> 02:33:54,390
stationary on the back way back when in

3273
02:33:49,920 --> 02:33:56,460
the day in the day that sounds sweet

3274
02:33:54,390 --> 02:33:58,109
yeah well you have to share that story

3275
02:33:56,459 --> 02:34:01,199
with Carolyn when you meet her when you

3276
02:33:58,110 --> 02:34:05,190
see her and at the show yeah I'm hoping

3277
02:34:01,200 --> 02:34:09,329
that she'll come from so last year she

3278
02:34:05,190 --> 02:34:14,460
had a triple embolism in her brain and

3279
02:34:09,329 --> 02:34:17,521
she woke up surviving and in good

3280
02:34:14,459 --> 02:34:21,299
feelings and stuff but she woke up in

3281
02:34:17,521 --> 02:34:25,050
1998 and she doesn't remember anything

3282
02:34:21,299 --> 02:34:28,369
from 1998 forward till now which is

3283
02:34:25,049 --> 02:34:30,898
pretty much our whole relationship and

3284
02:34:28,370 --> 02:34:32,670
it's so I don't know she'll come I keep

3285
02:34:30,898 --> 02:34:34,379
kind of talked her into it but she's

3286
02:34:32,670 --> 02:34:36,389
very hesitant

3287
02:34:34,379 --> 02:34:39,059
she sort of treats me like an insurance

3288
02:34:36,389 --> 02:34:41,309
salesman on the second call these days

3289
02:34:39,059 --> 02:34:44,579
when I talk to her because he just

3290
02:34:41,309 --> 02:34:46,739
doesn't remember I can't fault her for I

3291
02:34:44,579 --> 02:34:48,840
can't pressure I can't push her all I

3292
02:34:46,739 --> 02:34:51,209
can do is just give her support and

3293
02:34:48,840 --> 02:34:53,340
that's what I do maybe she'll show up it

3294
02:34:51,209 --> 02:34:56,699
would be a great blessing if that

3295
02:34:53,340 --> 02:34:59,250
happened because I'm gonna have on a

3296
02:34:56,700 --> 02:35:03,180
trailer there a unit that you can pull

3297
02:34:59,250 --> 02:35:08,489
into the field harvest and extract in

3298
02:35:03,180 --> 02:35:12,090
real time and it's for me it's like you

3299
02:35:08,489 --> 02:35:15,989
know a big achievement and I would love

3300
02:35:12,090 --> 02:35:18,090
her to be there and see it but she

3301
02:35:15,989 --> 02:35:23,670
doesn't really remember me so not much

3302
02:35:18,090 --> 02:35:27,840
I'm gonna be able to do about that check

3303
