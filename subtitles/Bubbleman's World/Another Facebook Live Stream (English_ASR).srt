a while since I did a Facebook live so

3
00:00:09,349 --> 00:00:12,990

4

23
00:01:00,259 --> 00:01:05,789
expanding into many different projects

24
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,469
you know they've got their LP thing

25
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:10,080
going with tweed and they took a little

26
00:01:07,469 --> 00:01:12,359
bit of guff for that but it's nice to

27
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:14,429
see them hey if you've got a complaint

28
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:17,039

29
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:19,200
and you see a guys like DNA go in don't

30
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,729
slag on them give them support they're

31
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,100
there to make it better they're there to

32
00:01:20,728 --> 00:01:24,659
actually not sell out but to actually

33
00:01:23,099 --> 00:01:26,280
make the thing that everyone's

34
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:28,100
complaining about much better so it's

35
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,859
important that we see that perspective

36
00:01:28,099 --> 00:01:35,489
welcome Patrick and Jos Jeffrey Jenn

37
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:37,170
Bennett's Michael - Tom McCluskey chili

38
00:01:35,489 --> 00:01:40,319
boo in the house

39
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:42,000
Matt Armstrong I think it's time for a

40
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:44,209
little six star bubble hash here

41
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,140
freeze-dried to damn near perfection

42
00:01:44,209 --> 00:01:47,908
it's all about the cold these days

43
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,780
everyone wants to make things cold cold

44
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:52,259
cold cold cold

45
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:54,540
I love making hash myself because you

46
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:56,430
know when you make oil what you're

47
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,868
losing and missing out on I'm not saying

48
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,790
you're missing out on or losing

49
00:01:57,868 --> 00:02:02,599
necessarily but what is not there it's

50
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:07,140
truly not there there is a fibrous mat

51
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:09,449
inside the trichome head and that is

52
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:13,199
where the glandular trichomes bio

53
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:15,889
synthesizes cannabinoids and terpenoids

54
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:18,449
cackles and organelles called plastids

55
00:02:15,889 --> 00:02:20,098
these plastids are filled with phenols

56
00:02:18,449 --> 00:02:23,039
and terpenes and they push up into the

57
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:28,560
upper membrane and in that fibrous mat

58
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:30,090
is where we basically biosynthesize all

59
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,620
of the known terpenes and cannabinoids

60
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:36,840
and when you squeeze or extract with oil

61
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:38,610
with solvents you basically leave that

62
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,739
fibrous matte behind and that is why

63
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:44,489
there is such a difference between oil

64
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:45,930
and hash and it's why someone like you

65
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:50,069
know Haley

66
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:51,989
Cheryl T's daughter suffer from seizures

67
00:02:50,068 --> 00:02:53,458
like you wouldn't believe they took her

68
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:55,500
off oil they put her on bubble hash

69
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:58,379
capsules and suddenly she's not having

70
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:00,360
seizures for 30 or 40 or 50 days now

71
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:02,579
that's not going to work with everyone

72
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:05,280
but it's definitely one of the major

73
00:03:02,579 --> 00:03:07,140
differences between oil and between hash

74
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,310
and why they're not the same thing and

75
00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:10,379
why I love the quiver

76
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:11,759
I'm never gonna be just an oil or just a

77
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:14,129
hash guy I'm always gonna want to offer

78
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:17,039
people the majority of both of those

79
00:03:14,129 --> 00:03:18,959
things that are available hey what's up

80
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:21,568

83
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:27,719

00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:40,409

seen him at was in Jamaica and you can

91

always tell Archie is so gung-ho he

92
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:46,260

165
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:45,959
30 varieties that I have that's my only

166
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:46,790
sort of problem with the Terps it's a

167
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:49,199
tough one

168
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:50,700
yes only the bottom plate heats up

169
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,560
that's why I have them closed because

170
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:54,899
the bottom plate heats the top plate up

171
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:58,800
and that is absolutely the Mercedes

172
00:07:54,899 --> 00:08:01,189
rosin presses Evan Haller 100% man that

173
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:05,129
bubble hit or that bubble hit got me lit

174
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:07,050
really nice and strong this sfv og happy

175
00:08:05,129 --> 00:08:11,730
to have a little west coast concentrate

176
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:13,740
back in the back in the stash I also

177
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:18,710
didn't really mention it but I dabbed

178
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:22,500
red congolese with that SFO g SF vog

179
00:08:18,709 --> 00:08:23,699
bring me your 3 faves well I'll

180
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,430
definitely have those that'll probably

181
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:29,360
be like Karma's [ __ ] cush cleaner and

182
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:31,500
maybe red congolese something like that

183
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,949
you gotta trust them you gotta trust

184
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,080
them

185
00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:36,479
bring some water hash - well actually

186
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:39,270
the West Coast concentrate guys maybe at

187
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,740
my booth booth 197 although with the

188
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:43,049
Karma Cup losing you know what it you

189
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:46,110
can't see it up very close unfortunately

190
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:47,879
but I can trust that it's six star its

191
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:49,560
freeze-dried so it has that really light

192
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:51,179
color and then on the edges where it's

193
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:52,769
gumming up and

194
00:08:51,179 --> 00:08:56,719
greasing out is where I've been picking

195
00:08:52,769 --> 00:08:59,579
it off so it's definitely super fire

196
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:03,660
there's no doubt about that Joey cush

197
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:05,940
cleaner is fire aah yes they do have a

198
00:09:03,659 --> 00:09:08,039
review coming out of that sfv for the

199
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:12,170
THC see they better get it out soon

200
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:12,169
because I'm filming mine today

201
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:20,310
those guys are busy busy as [ __ ] not

202
00:09:16,049 --> 00:09:22,588
that I'm not I'm busier but I am set up

203
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:24,569
with camera galore hey how about this my

204
00:09:22,589 --> 00:09:30,570
brand new 4k camera that I bought the

205
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:33,750
other day I dropped it it's all [ __ ]

206
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:35,940
up it's making funny funny sounds on the

207
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:38,250
inside kind of bummed out still films

208
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:40,950
but it's got moving parts inside of it

209
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:43,080
so might be on a little bit of a break

210
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:46,230
for videos once I send that in to get it

211
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:47,790
fixed my old video camera which is here

212
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:50,670
I don't think it's gonna be doing the

213
00:09:47,789 --> 00:09:53,099
job that it was doing before so I might

214
00:09:50,669 --> 00:09:55,469
have to start filming on my on my 5d on

215
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:57,330
this big bad boy right here this is what

216
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:58,830
I might start filming on for a few

217
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:01,528
videos it's tougher because it doesn't

218
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:03,930
have that same ability yeah I know I'm

219
00:10:01,528 --> 00:10:06,000
the worst with electronics crashed my

220
00:10:03,929 --> 00:10:07,889
drone too and [ __ ] up the gimbal on

221
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,179
the camera so it's just you know what

222
00:10:07,889 --> 00:10:10,379
just take it in and get it fixed it's

223
00:10:09,179 --> 00:10:12,059
not the end of the world when you do

224
00:10:10,379 --> 00:10:16,350
these things these are toys these are

225
00:10:12,059 --> 00:10:18,509
use and things that you use to to to

226
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:24,750
play with and to get to get that gravy

227
00:10:18,509 --> 00:10:26,159
footage yeah and Dornan to be honest I'm

228
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,690
getting it fixed right away and I think

229
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:29,458
it's actually just a piece of plastic on

230
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:31,050
the inside that broke and then it's

231
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:33,569
nothing actually major because there's

232
00:10:31,049 --> 00:10:35,159
no nothing in the camera is affected at

233
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:38,278
all I've already filmed with it I've

234
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:40,379
already recorded with it and hey right

235
00:10:38,278 --> 00:10:42,860
on Nolan I'm glad you had a DAB maybe

236
00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:45,659
I'll have one more dab before we split

237
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:47,820
what do I think about the TCC syrup bar

238
00:10:45,659 --> 00:10:50,819
in cannabis culture all right here we go

239
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:52,800
great question Jeffrey's in OD I don't

240
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:55,620
[ __ ] like it at all

241
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:58,120
I don't think it's a very I mean I I see

242
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:00,100
everyone trying to take different things

243
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:02,679
and I can sort of see the perspective of

244
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:04,808
trying to make sipping syrup a better

245
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:07,269
thing but really my perspective is that

246
00:11:04,808 --> 00:11:09,188
sippin syrup is really like a scourge

247
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:11,649
and kind of a tear on the social fabric

248
00:11:09,188 --> 00:11:13,360
it's not good it's not something I would

249
00:11:11,649 --> 00:11:14,919
want to promote it's not something that

250
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,839
I can't personally believe cannabis

251
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:18,429
culture or the karma Cup is supporting

252
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:20,800
it but when you have these companies

253
00:11:18,429 --> 00:11:23,138
sponsoring things that's what makes

254
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:25,299
people say good things about their

255
00:11:23,139 --> 00:11:27,278
products because they have a biased and

256
00:11:25,299 --> 00:11:29,078
they're making money with it oh hello

257
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:31,208
there mom all that Richardson in the

258
00:11:29,078 --> 00:11:33,008
house hello hello so I'm not a big fun

259
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:35,258
fan of like keep in mind this

260
00:11:33,009 --> 00:11:37,509
promethazine syrup you know where they

261
00:11:35,259 --> 00:11:39,399
mix in with Jolly Ranchers and sprite

262
00:11:37,509 --> 00:11:41,169
and a few other things vice has a

263
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:43,749
documentary on it and it's definitely

264
00:11:41,169 --> 00:11:45,240
not Pro you can really see how a lot of

265
00:11:43,749 --> 00:11:47,800
these guys are addicted to it like very

266
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:51,100
badly addicted to it it's basically like

267
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:54,278
opioids and it's just kind of all-around

268
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:56,430
bummer I see it as not a positive and

269
00:11:54,278 --> 00:11:58,899
I'm surprised that it's sort of

270
00:11:56,429 --> 00:12:02,198
squeezing into the into the cannabis

271
00:11:58,899 --> 00:12:03,759
world because I just I mean yeah you

272
00:12:02,198 --> 00:12:06,849
want a sip cannabis you want to do that

273
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:11,678
no problem but why market it as a syrup

274
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:13,269
why market it as as lean yeah it is

275
00:12:11,678 --> 00:12:14,980
opioids that's what I'm saying dude it's

276
00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:16,240
terrible [ __ ] now the stuff they're

277
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:18,730
selling at cannabis culture is not

278
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:23,318
opioids it's a THC version but what I'm

279
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:26,769
saying is why even promote and teach and

280
00:12:23,318 --> 00:12:31,389
educate about syrup or lean when it's

281
00:12:26,769 --> 00:12:34,389
just I don't know I think it's negative

282
00:12:31,389 --> 00:12:36,249
- yeah and I really do I'm not I'm not

283
00:12:34,389 --> 00:12:37,778
gonna do it I mean I'm not it's my own

284
00:12:36,249 --> 00:12:39,579
personal opinion so I'm not gonna go out

285
00:12:37,778 --> 00:12:41,769
and do anything about it I'm not gonna

286
00:12:39,578 --> 00:12:43,659
be like I did kind of text Jodi at one

287
00:12:41,769 --> 00:12:45,970
point I think I texted one other person

288
00:12:43,659 --> 00:12:48,188
saying is this for real like a syrup bar

289
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:51,999
like doesn't that does anyone else think

290
00:12:48,188 --> 00:12:54,308
that that's weird but apparently no not

291
00:12:51,999 --> 00:12:57,699
a lot of people do but that's my answer

292
00:12:54,308 --> 00:13:00,360
and I'm sorry if it upsets you know the

293
00:12:57,698 --> 00:13:03,969
caribou company or cannabis culture or

294
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:06,370
the karma cup I just I wouldn't

295
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:08,019
personally take that money I personally

296
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:10,149
wouldn't even if I was trying to pay my

297
00:13:08,019 --> 00:13:11,029
rent I would just choose to figure out

298
00:13:10,149 --> 00:13:16,399
something else

299
00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:18,019
so just me I mean yeah if it can steer

300
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,699
lean heads away from th see that's what

301
00:13:18,019 --> 00:13:22,340
I'm saying there is a potential Pro but

302
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:24,830
to me it's a strange thing to grab ahold

303
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:26,180
of and promote a product as in and if

304
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:27,920
you look at these companies they've made

305
00:13:26,179 --> 00:13:29,809
the bottle look just like the promesa

306
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:32,839
these methods een bottles the cough

307
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:37,369
syrup bottles they it's definitely 100

308
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:41,330
percent promoted as hey you'd like check

309
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:44,960
this out we got the THC lean so I don't

310
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:46,430
know well thank you there Matt we're

311
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:49,040
trying to send out the good vibes

312
00:13:46,429 --> 00:13:50,120
sex sells drug sell its business sadly

313
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:52,099
well that's it you know and I've also

314
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,330
never really done that someone asked me

315
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,649
the other day hey you've got money man

316
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:57,139
why don't you just hire some hot chicks

317
00:13:54,649 --> 00:13:58,730
at your booth and I was like oh that's

318
00:13:57,139 --> 00:14:01,009
not really how I like to promote my

319
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:02,060
product I know a lot about my product

320
00:14:01,009 --> 00:14:04,129
and I'm not saying that there's anything

321
00:14:02,059 --> 00:14:05,959
wrong with hot chicks by any means I

322
00:14:04,129 --> 00:14:09,200
just don't think that personally I want

323
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:12,379
to use sexuality and girls to attract

324
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:13,820
people to my booth to then try and you

325
00:14:12,379 --> 00:14:15,889
know lay into them with the knowledge

326
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:17,510
that we currently have I'm more like hey

327
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:19,129
if you want to come by and learn about

328
00:14:17,509 --> 00:14:22,519
something I'll gladly spend a half an

329
00:14:19,129 --> 00:14:24,830
hour talking to you but I'm not gonna

330
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:27,559
try and bring people in with with with

331
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:29,060
scantily clad girls and whatnot I've

332
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:33,319
been doing this for almost 20 years and

333
00:14:29,059 --> 00:14:36,349
I've never done that so that's it that's

334
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:39,770
it squish on what's up Chadwick Bastardo

335
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:41,990
in the house now that is compassion from

336
00:14:39,769 --> 00:14:43,939
the old overgrow days he is the

337
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:47,570
originator of the rasen technique at

338
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:49,520
least in the original first that we all

339
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:51,470
saw he and it was different from the

340
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:53,990
squish you know it was the timing wasn't

341
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:56,629
on but he was taking hash and you know

342
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:58,940
in a double boiler milking the resin

343
00:14:56,629 --> 00:15:01,519
glands out of non melty hash around a

344
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:03,050
metal bowl or a glass bowl and he has

345
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:06,860
some amazing pictures if you punch in

346
00:15:03,049 --> 00:15:09,139
compassion Co mph JSON and full melt

347
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:10,310
bubble his pictures will come up and you

348
00:15:09,139 --> 00:15:13,120
can see what I'm talking about they're

349
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:17,389
definitely on point it's good to see you

350
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:18,710
Chadwick just a name yeah yeah yeah it's

351
00:15:17,389 --> 00:15:20,120
just a name but I mean I still like to

352
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:21,379
give props where props or duty or the

353
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,429
first person I ever heard talk about

354
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:24,679
that

355
00:15:22,429 --> 00:15:27,709
and it wasn't until years like a decade

356
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:29,599
later that that soil groans was

357
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:31,580
squishing a bud and it's funny because

358
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,550
even all of that happened for a unique

359
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:37,430
reason the way Tony was actually using a

360
00:15:34,549 --> 00:15:38,778
small hair straightener to press out his

361
00:15:37,429 --> 00:15:39,769
bubble and I used to always laugh at

362
00:15:38,778 --> 00:15:41,240
these guys because they're like yeah

363
00:15:39,769 --> 00:15:42,740
we'd take the full Mel we put it in the

364
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:45,169
parchment we close it and then we press

365
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:46,879
it out into dabs and I was just an old

366
00:15:45,169 --> 00:15:49,278
school like really I just squeezed mine

367
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:51,470
and my fingers but it was from Tony

368
00:15:49,278 --> 00:15:54,649
doing that that nicotine it up and

369
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:56,959
others and when nicotine was doing it it

370
00:15:54,649 --> 00:15:59,659
was soil grown who saw nicotine doing

371
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:01,278
that and he just tried it with a bud he

372
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:04,069
just you know cuz he was squeezing hash

373
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:05,450
but when he ran out of hash and he

374
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:07,250
wasn't squeezing it Faraz and he was

375
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:08,810
just squeezing it to press it into dabs

376
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:10,429
and I guess one time he squeezed it a

377
00:16:08,809 --> 00:16:13,159
little hard and a little bit of oil came

378
00:16:10,429 --> 00:16:14,509
out then he ran out of hash and he got a

379
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:16,399
bud and he thought maybe I'll just try

380
00:16:14,509 --> 00:16:19,429
squishing a bud and he squished it and

381
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:21,620
literally got results and that's really

382
00:16:19,429 --> 00:16:24,199
how it all kind of came around you know

383
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:26,659
it was it wasn't like he was watching

384
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:29,480
Chad's post from back in the day it was

385
00:16:26,659 --> 00:16:32,059
really an accident that happened from

386
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:33,830
you know some things that Tony was doing

387
00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:36,079
Pat and then other people kind of picked

388
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:37,820
up and started doing and that he saw

389
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:39,770
that person doing and then did this

390
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:43,190
accidental thing and these are his words

391
00:16:39,769 --> 00:16:45,889
he told this story on hash Church 25 or

392
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:47,300
30 or whatever number it was that that

393
00:16:45,889 --> 00:16:49,990
he first came on and we did the whole

394
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:52,849
rosin episode which if you look back a

395
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:55,759
lot of the rosin in from all the

396
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:58,159
companies came after that episode there

397
00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:00,980
was not a single person creating

398
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:02,899
industrial presses or using presses to

399
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:04,009
make rosin at that point it was a hair

400
00:17:02,899 --> 00:17:06,619
straightener thing and after that

401
00:17:04,009 --> 00:17:07,970
dialogue in hash Church that's where it

402
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:09,948
all started that's where people picked

403
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:12,558
up these ideas to start making presses

404
00:17:09,949 --> 00:17:15,140
and products and the 50 companies were

405
00:17:12,558 --> 00:17:17,029
born overnight and it's been interesting

406
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:21,130
to see it's definitely been interesting

407
00:17:17,029 --> 00:17:24,109
to see yeah it sure is Chadwick I agree

408
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:25,760
I'm doing well Ivan I'm not gonna

409
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:27,678
complain I think I'm gonna take another

410
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:29,839
dab with you guys and then let you all

411
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:31,490
go kind of said I was gonna be talking

412
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:33,349
about cannabis and I don't know if we

413
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:36,109
really talked about cannabis at all but

414
00:17:33,349 --> 00:17:38,899
well we talked about hash

415
00:17:36,109 --> 00:17:41,509
that's a part of cannabis this is really

416
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:46,490
nice bubble really nice thing I'm gonna

417
00:17:41,509 --> 00:17:49,029
go back into the red congolese mmm yeah

418
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:51,859
just remnants in this jar right now but

419
00:17:49,029 --> 00:17:54,740
I'll tell you these terpene jars are

420
00:17:51,859 --> 00:17:57,259
never empty never empty and if you guys

421
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:59,690
haven't gone on Blue River extract CA

422
00:17:57,259 --> 00:18:02,410
the Canadian site I lowered the price of

423
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:06,798
the Jamaican terpenes down to like I

424
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:10,250
don't know like 70 bucks a vial but only

425
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:12,529
if you buy the 1 ml so I lowered it very

426
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:15,679
substantially by 1 ml and you get it for

427
00:18:12,529 --> 00:18:17,690
300 bucks and that's 4 packs of 0.25 ml

428
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,548
so people complaining about the price

429
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:21,410
don't say I never did anything good for

430
00:18:19,548 --> 00:18:24,950
you all three of the Jamaican terpenes

431
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:28,519
are available in one ml which is 4 of

432
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:31,308
the 10 drop files 40 drops and it's like

433
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:33,829
300 bucks so it's substantially cheaper

434
00:18:31,308 --> 00:18:37,579
than anything I've had available hello

435
00:18:33,829 --> 00:18:39,139
Heidi Handford welcome welcome anything

436
00:18:37,579 --> 00:18:41,329

437
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:42,799

one of these days I've got like 20

439
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:49,730
varieties in my Pelican case at any time

440
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:51,950
I did not see the price of clones from

441
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:53,569
Whistler 5 clones for 750 that's pretty

442
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:55,700
ridiculous I'll have to mock them about

443
00:18:53,569 --> 00:18:58,899
that I'm gonna go see them soon and do a

444
00:18:55,700 --> 00:19:01,130
little walkthrough of their facility so

445
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:02,540
why not the regular Terps I don't know

446
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:06,559

449
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:12,829
information is on the website so you

450
00:19:10,339 --> 00:19:16,220
look up the strain you had you go into

451
00:19:12,829 --> 00:19:17,990
the SC labs the the testing area he's

452
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:19,009
got a big spot that says testing and

453
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:21,620
then you just go look at the variety

454
00:19:19,009 --> 00:19:23,058
that you have and you can print it up

455
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:25,279
and you'll have all the information that

456
00:19:23,058 --> 00:19:28,250
you want about what's there hello there

457
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:30,639
Lisa Lorraine's Werner I'm not sure what

458
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:35,990
you mean by regular turps Raimondo

459
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:37,700
yeah 750 s ouch I'll be there first

460

463
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:46,370
bring a bunch of Terps I hope to see you

464
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:47,779
guys in Toronto have a big session it'll

465
00:19:46,369 --> 00:19:51,039
be great and we'll have some West Coast

466
00:19:47,779 --> 00:19:51,039
concentrate bubble hash as well

467
00:19:57,898 --> 00:20:12,579
well Raimondo because they cost more and

468
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:14,409
I'm not gonna sell them at a loss the

469
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:16,269
non Jamaican ones are from California

470
00:20:14,409 --> 00:20:18,669
and if you've ever been to those two

471
00:20:16,269 --> 00:20:21,368
places you'll understand that the price

472
00:20:18,669 --> 00:20:23,019
of good cannabis in California is very

473
00:20:21,368 --> 00:20:26,138
different from the price of good

474
00:20:23,019 --> 00:20:27,970
cannabis in Jamaica we've passed that

475
00:20:26,138 --> 00:20:30,729
savings on to you but we certainly can't

476
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:33,460
offer it to you with our California

477
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:36,519
flavors unfortunately I wish I could I

478
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:38,710
really do but you know what I'll say

479
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:41,048
this much if you like what I've been

480
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:43,119
doing if you appreciate all the

481
00:20:41,048 --> 00:20:45,128
information that I share if you've used

482
00:20:43,118 --> 00:20:46,658
bubble bags for all of these years and

483
00:20:45,128 --> 00:20:49,599
learned how to dry sift with me and

484
00:20:46,659 --> 00:20:50,649
appreciate hashed Church and all of

485
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:52,418
these different things that I bring

486
00:20:50,648 --> 00:20:55,178
including these live video Facebook's

487
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:57,850
it's not a bad idea to support me in my

488
00:20:55,179 --> 00:20:59,499
new ventures I don't say this very often

489
00:20:57,849 --> 00:21:01,449
but if you have a friend that you think

490
00:20:59,499 --> 00:21:03,940
is great and semaine you and you want to

491
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:06,429
support them for God's sakes don't ask

492
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:08,320
them for a deal on their product while

493
00:21:06,429 --> 00:21:11,169
they're starting a company if anything

494
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:13,628
and they're your friend pay extra they

495
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:15,549
are struggling and remember all of their

496
00:21:13,628 --> 00:21:17,618
friends are asking for the same thing a

497
00:21:15,548 --> 00:21:19,450
deal and what a deal means to someone

498
00:21:17,618 --> 00:21:21,638
who's starting their new company is for

499
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:23,919
them just to cut out their profit and

500
00:21:21,638 --> 00:21:26,019
when they cut out their profit they're

501
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:28,570
unable to succeed in their new business

502
00:21:26,019 --> 00:21:30,249
and the thing that you could have said I

503
00:21:28,569 --> 00:21:31,898
supported that company in early days I

504
00:21:30,249 --> 00:21:34,569
used to buy those packs for full price

505
00:21:31,898 --> 00:21:36,488
and I supported him that's amazing

506
00:21:34,569 --> 00:21:37,928
that's how you keep good companies

507
00:21:36,489 --> 00:21:38,460
around do we want to bring the price

508
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:40,509
down

509
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:42,970
absolutely is it going to stay the way

510
00:21:40,509 --> 00:21:45,669
it is absolutely not we are going to

511
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:48,118
non-stop lower and lower and lower and

512
00:21:45,669 --> 00:21:50,859
lower the price but that's all about

513
00:21:48,118 --> 00:21:52,329
manifesting cheaper pounds being able to

514
00:21:50,858 --> 00:21:53,949
buy more pounds being able to take

515
00:21:52,329 --> 00:21:55,388
control of larger greenhouses there's a

516
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:58,990
whole bunch of [ __ ] that's involved with

517
00:21:55,388 --> 00:22:01,839
this and all I'm saying is don't always

518
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:02,539
ask for a deal you know sometimes it's

519
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:04,189
okay to

520
00:22:02,539 --> 00:22:06,200
support and I'm not just talking with me

521
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:07,970
remove me from the equation remove my

522
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:10,789
company I'm talking about your friends

523
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:13,370
that you know in life that are starting

524
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:15,529
a business can you for God's sakes

525
00:22:13,369 --> 00:22:18,109
support their business by paying the

526
00:22:15,529 --> 00:22:20,539
normal price do not ask for a deal

527
00:22:18,109 --> 00:22:23,629
it's a horrible non friendship thing to

528
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:26,089
do if anything well the topic right now

529
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:28,130
Martin is you know friends starting new

530
00:22:26,089 --> 00:22:30,139
companies do we want to ask them for the

531
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:32,900
deal or do we want to offer them to pay

532
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:34,340
the price or I mean I've done this paid

533
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:36,530
a higher price because I want to support

534
00:22:34,339 --> 00:22:38,240
my friends business and I don't need to

535
00:22:36,529 --> 00:22:40,700
do that for five years but maybe in the

536
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,799
first year or two that I support that

537
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:44,539
business I won't mind paying full price

538
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:47,539
because I know it's a hell of a thing

539
00:22:44,539 --> 00:22:49,849
starting a new business it's a hell of a

540
00:22:47,539 --> 00:22:52,339
thing and the taxman is gonna come after

541
00:22:49,849 --> 00:22:55,069
you and the brokerage and the shipping

542
00:22:52,339 --> 00:22:56,569
and the your cost the people you buy

543
00:22:55,069 --> 00:22:58,129
your products from will constantly try

544
00:22:56,569 --> 00:23:00,649
to erase that like everything is an

545
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:03,470
endless price up one of the things that

546
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:05,450
with bubble bags that I very much not

547
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:06,860
done over the years is raise the price I

548
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:09,440
came out with a high price because I

549
00:23:06,859 --> 00:23:11,299
knew I'm gonna offer a a lifetime

550
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,940
warranty and that's part of the price

551
00:23:11,299 --> 00:23:15,710
I'm gonna offer incredible customer

552
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:18,140
service and I'm gonna be able to be

553
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:19,519
accessible to all my customers meaning

554
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:22,040
you'll be able to talk to me personally

555
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:24,319
you'll be able to call me up or email me

556
00:23:22,039 --> 00:23:25,940
or text me and I will answer your

557
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:29,149
question that's something that I do

558
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:30,830
hey welcome Nick tell oh so that's all I

559
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:32,750
was going off on about that no one even

560
00:23:30,829 --> 00:23:35,000
asked for a price break someone just

561
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:36,920
asked why the non cali or why the non

562
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,799
jamaican terpenes weren't on sale and it

563
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:41,750
brought me to remember this that i said

564
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:43,669
before in here that it was that it's

565
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:45,619
okay sometimes to support a business

566
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:47,150
don't always feel like you have to grind

567
00:23:45,619 --> 00:23:49,429
someone down because here's the bottom

568
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:51,860
line when you go by the coca-cola at the

569
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:54,920
grocery store from the multi-billion

570
00:23:51,859 --> 00:23:58,669
dollar coca-cola company do you ask for

571
00:23:54,920 --> 00:24:00,110
a deal no you swallow whatever price

572
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:01,700
they're [ __ ] offering you now I

573
00:24:00,109 --> 00:24:04,250
personally don't even [ __ ] support

574
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:05,630
well I probably support Coco coca-cola

575
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:07,549
through one of the thousand companies

576
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:10,250
they own but I don't drink coca-cola I

577
00:24:07,549 --> 00:24:13,369
generally don't drink pop try not to

578
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:14,960
anyway but it's funny cuz people in

579
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:15,259
India will grind the guy on the side of

580
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,819
the

581
00:24:15,259 --> 00:24:19,339
who's selling juice to put food on his

582
00:24:16,819 --> 00:24:20,960
foot on his table for his kids but

583
00:24:19,339 --> 00:24:22,849
they'll go by like a coca-cola or a

584
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,970
Fanta and just pay full price and not

585
00:24:22,849 --> 00:24:27,469
even worry about you know the the cost

586
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:29,150
difference there I think that we've

587
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:34,190
gotten stuck in this very strange

588
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:36,019
experience of not realizing that because

589
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:37,759
because it's so hard to earn money and

590
00:24:36,019 --> 00:24:39,619
you know when you earn money you realize

591
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:41,960
well [ __ ] I can save money by just

592
00:24:39,619 --> 00:24:44,299
trying to get a deal trying to use that

593
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:46,490
coupon trying to try to get the best

594
00:24:44,299 --> 00:24:47,690
possible sometimes people will stack you

595
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:49,160
know they'll be like I want the medical

596
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:50,809
prize plus I heard you got a coupon plus

597
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:52,700
I heard it's a Christmas discount it's

598
00:24:50,809 --> 00:24:54,289
like often I'll just be like you can

599
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:56,269
have the bags and I've given away

600
00:24:54,289 --> 00:24:59,389
hundreds if not thousands of sets of

601
00:24:56,269 --> 00:25:00,889
bubble bags over the last 20 years happy

602
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:02,530
to do that you know and that's another

603
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:05,509
thing that when you're paying full price

604
00:25:02,529 --> 00:25:08,899
you can know that it's like a almost a

605
00:25:05,509 --> 00:25:11,000
form of any type of you know I don't

606
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:13,370
talk about my philanthropy but I do it I

607
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,920
do philanthropy and when you support my

608
00:25:13,369 --> 00:25:17,929
companies that philanthropy is now part

609
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:19,759
of you you're you're a part of it and

610
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:21,380
it's you know doing things like when

611
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:22,819
chimera got busted sending him some

612
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:24,500
money so he could get up on his feet

613
00:25:22,819 --> 00:25:28,009
when Mark went to jail

614
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:30,529
sending Jodie to see him in mrs. hippy

615
00:25:28,009 --> 00:25:32,990
those planes and hotels and car rentals

616
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:35,509
all cost money so things like that I try

617
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:36,890
to do on the regular in my community I

618
00:25:35,509 --> 00:25:38,509
won't post about them and I won't

619
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:41,810
generally talk about them but they get

620
00:25:38,509 --> 00:25:44,059
done and that's another part of just you

621
00:25:41,809 --> 00:25:50,720
know supporting and paying paying the

622
00:25:44,059 --> 00:25:53,139
price yeah drew I see I feel you you

623
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:55,610
know that's what I feel

624
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:56,720
yeah Nick I would love to be talking to

625
00:25:55,609 --> 00:25:58,339
your customers I don't even know where

626
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,079
you're at right now but a smoke shop

627
00:25:58,339 --> 00:26:01,369
sounds cool it's always fun to be able

628
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:03,169
to if you guys share this on your

629
00:26:01,369 --> 00:26:05,239
Facebook the people that watch your

630
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:06,860
Facebook's are able to see this as well

631
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:09,980
so that's one thing that you can do and

632
00:26:06,859 --> 00:26:15,919
that's wonderful any new things with the

633
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:20,450
charitable or get out it too much the

634
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:22,340
stuff that I'm doing on the charity but

635
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:24,410
I promise you I do it I find even

636
00:26:22,339 --> 00:26:26,299
mentioning the few little ones here now

637
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:27,470
it takes I mention those because they're

638
00:26:26,299 --> 00:26:28,940
long

639
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:31,009
they were mentioned in public by those

640
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:33,200
two people but I won't mention other

641
00:26:31,009 --> 00:26:35,210
ones because I feel that if you're just

642
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,220
helping someone so people can know about

643
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:39,288
it then you're kind of a douchebag and

644
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:43,630
I'm sure that they still got help but I

645
00:26:39,288 --> 00:26:43,629
