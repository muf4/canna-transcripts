well I'm honored to be able to screw

40
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:15,289
this on we talked so much about it I

41
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:16,969
know that you were in Jamaica and Tony

42
00:02:15,289 --> 00:02:19,639
was talking more than you guys me back

43
00:02:16,969 --> 00:02:23,318
and forth and it's it one two three turn

44
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:31,119
on it's a five one

45
00:02:23,318 --> 00:02:31,119
five turns it on ready I am

46
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:35,799
you take a few seconds to load the

47
00:02:34,389 --> 00:02:38,348
cartridge you'll probably have to slowly

48
00:02:35,799 --> 00:02:41,709
now pull and gentle while you're heating

49
00:02:38,348 --> 00:02:43,149
up the oil which is obviously quite cold

50
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:46,299
on the outside of the cartridge right

51
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:50,890
now on the inside the cartridge it's

52
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:53,019
just starting to milk it'll take a

53
00:02:50,889 --> 00:02:55,658
little bit you want to heat this up good

54
00:02:53,019 --> 00:02:57,219
oh yeah it's going good

55
00:02:55,658 --> 00:03:00,340
it's starting to starting to feel warm

56
00:02:57,219 --> 00:03:04,090
anyway that'll boil that rosin at the

57
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:06,340
bottom pull it into the cartridge and it

58
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:08,229
may take a few more bits flavor right

59
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:09,370
now it's coming that's the one well that

60
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:10,689
bright whenever you had to break

61
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:13,950
something in you know you got is things

62
00:03:10,689 --> 00:03:18,479
this is like breaking in your new Ben

63
00:03:13,949 --> 00:03:18,479
got a break stuff in him yeah

64
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:31,409
it's just that no no no

65
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:32,880
no it's on ice-melt the Terps it's

66
00:03:31,409 --> 00:03:34,169
boiling at the bottom so now it's

67
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,729
pulling now it's pulling into the

68
00:03:34,169 --> 00:03:37,439
cartridge I'm watching you and pull oil

69
00:03:35,729 --> 00:03:41,189
into the cartridge for the first time oh

70
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:43,020
yeah oh wow it's bubbling and the

71
00:03:41,189 --> 00:03:45,090
bubbles are getting pulled into the

72
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:46,710
cartridge so this cartridge is a little

73
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:52,289
bit tricky the first thing you need to

74
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:54,150
do oh there you go Johnny PU got took a

75
00:03:52,289 --> 00:03:55,679
little bit but he finally got one so

76
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:57,360
with this cartridge in particular when I

77
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,780
gave him the cartridge the oil was very

78
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,400
hard like cold so you've got to heat it

79
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:04,530
up a little bit you've got to boil the

80
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,210
oil on the bottom and once it boils it

81
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:09,390
goes into these holes that are over the

82
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:12,960
beam now here's the most important part

83
00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:14,639
guard that smells an incredible pull on

84
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,049
it when you're done so pull on it right

85
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:17,608
now without pushing the button it's a

86
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:19,108
very important part without pushing the

87
00:04:17,608 --> 00:04:21,358
button you're gonna pull a few times and

88
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:23,339
what that does is it pulls the oil back

89
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:25,620
into the cartridge it cools the oil and

90
00:04:23,339 --> 00:04:27,329
it keeps the oil from dripping and so if

91
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,189
you hit these pens a lot and you don't

92
00:04:27,329 --> 00:04:30,959
do what John's doing right now what's

93
00:04:29,189 --> 00:04:32,279
gonna happen is the oil is gonna drip

94
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:34,409
down to your battery and this is what

95
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:36,000
happens with a lot of these tanks we've

96
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:38,189
found a very simple way to avoid it

97
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,379
happening completely cool the oil down a

98
00:04:38,189 --> 00:04:44,839
little bit before before you finish

99
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:44,839
using your pen how's that Johnny beat I

100
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:55,019
count one I'm on the end of mine I've

101
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,910
been smoking mine this one same

102
00:04:55,019 --> 00:04:58,019
cartridge yeah I've been puffing this

103
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:00,909
since

104
00:04:58,019 --> 00:05:04,329
since Toronto since the karma cup

105
00:05:00,908 --> 00:05:16,360
September 9th so that's like 10 almost

106
00:05:04,329 --> 00:05:17,800
10 days you need a proper pen it sounds

107
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:20,860
like we got to get you trying to eat my

108
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:24,038
buddy I'm just starting to get to the

109
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:26,199
end of my now cool well [ __ ] I'm glad

110
00:05:24,038 --> 00:05:28,748
you got that pan Johnny B I'm stoked

111
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:31,959
that it's working for you and what we'll

112
00:05:28,749 --> 00:05:33,699
look forward to hearing about your

113
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:35,168
critiques in the near future of how it

114
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:36,579
work you know what are you we've lived

115
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:38,588
taking pants apart we've talked about

116
00:05:36,579 --> 00:05:39,968
pans we talked about on casters we've

117
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:44,678
gone through you've seen the line of the

118
00:05:39,968 --> 00:05:46,478
Pens that I've destroyed I see that was

119
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:48,728
still rockin I dropped this out of my

120
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:50,199
truck from 6 feet in the and like out of

121
00:05:48,728 --> 00:05:52,240
the pocket standing in the back of my

122
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:54,038
truck and it fell right on the the

123
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,379
driveway and it just put a little dent

124
00:05:54,038 --> 00:05:58,300
and somehow I got another dent right

125
00:05:56,379 --> 00:06:00,699
here I haven't broken a piece of glass

126
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:02,588
yet and I've dropped it about 15 times

127
00:06:00,699 --> 00:06:04,180
yes interesting how this one could fall

128
00:06:02,588 --> 00:06:05,829
over it actually doesn't affect the

129
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:08,889
glass that's right you can see part of

130
00:06:05,829 --> 00:06:11,468
the design where all the other ones fall

131
00:06:08,889 --> 00:06:13,718
on the glass and break the glass I mean

132
00:06:11,468 --> 00:06:15,610
can i stuff one of these bags full of

133
00:06:13,718 --> 00:06:16,778
stuff well this is what we're gonna do

134
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:18,759
right now we're gonna preach Johnny

135
00:06:16,778 --> 00:06:20,199
wanted to well he wanted to take a

136
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:23,009
little bit of his Metis crush which is

137
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:26,889
absolutely spectacular here real nice

138
00:06:23,009 --> 00:06:30,038
cushy gassy kind of got that beautiful

139
00:06:26,889 --> 00:06:32,439
jarred flavor nice dense Nuggets so the

140
00:06:30,038 --> 00:06:34,209
real key to this is preparation so

141
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:36,639
you've got to figure out what you want

142
00:06:34,209 --> 00:06:39,158
to press whether it's 2 grams or 5 grams

143
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:41,889
or whatnot and then we'll prepare the

144
00:06:39,158 --> 00:06:43,149
bud because Matt from sasquatch was

145
00:06:41,889 --> 00:06:44,559
really showing the importance of

146
00:06:43,149 --> 00:06:46,778
breaking the buds into smaller pieces

147
00:06:44,559 --> 00:06:49,569
and filling the corners getting those

148
00:06:46,778 --> 00:06:51,088
corners and the whole side stopped so

149
00:06:49,569 --> 00:06:54,218
that you don't have any where for oil

150
00:06:51,088 --> 00:06:56,559
and I think 5 grams would be good that's

151
00:06:54,218 --> 00:06:58,118
right about there yeah at Point 2 there

152
00:06:56,559 --> 00:06:59,800
we go I wasn't gonna go for point 2 but

153
00:06:58,119 --> 00:07:01,119
we'll go 5 point to know if it doesn't

154
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:04,149
end it's I think that'll work really

155
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:06,999
well so if you just want to gently break

156
00:07:04,149 --> 00:07:07,829
your nugget apart we'll start throwing

157
00:07:06,999 --> 00:07:11,460
it into this bed

158
00:07:07,829 --> 00:07:13,228
little pieces and I can so you know what

159
00:07:11,459 --> 00:07:15,359
I really kind of look at looking at

160
00:07:13,228 --> 00:07:17,908
break it off look at that yeah no no

161
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,620
it's like I hate breaking he's like

162
00:07:17,908 --> 00:07:21,449
there's like it looks like there's a

163
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:26,280
bunch of sand here right now from just

164
00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:27,629
cracking that bud so it's really

165
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:29,098
important and that's one thing I'm

166
00:07:27,629 --> 00:07:32,189
learning cuz I don't really use the bags

167
00:07:29,098 --> 00:07:34,408
I write I just press bud yep I pressed

168
00:07:32,189 --> 00:07:37,199
bud for a while when I press like 5 or

169
00:07:34,408 --> 00:07:39,360
10 grams of bud I like having the bag I

170
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,460
know that my pressing is on point enough

171
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,680
that I can escape the oil get the oil

172
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:45,718
out it's only really when you get

173
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,509
inefficient that you'll leave oil behind

174
00:07:45,718 --> 00:07:49,918
in these bags and so and for me I'm

175
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:51,598
always using like the hair straightener

176
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:54,718
right right so that's what I've always

177
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:57,509
used yeah and that just it kind of kind

178
00:07:54,718 --> 00:07:58,620
of makes sense I don't use a bag I got a

179
00:07:57,509 --> 00:08:01,020
hair straightener or I got a can of

180
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:03,418
clamp now even with my hair

181
00:08:01,019 --> 00:08:05,698
straighteners I still had little bags

182
00:08:03,418 --> 00:08:07,378
that I used first first press I ever did

183
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:09,629
was wrapped in a little that was right

184
00:08:07,379 --> 00:08:11,789
to my micron bag that's why I still have

185
00:08:09,629 --> 00:08:13,379
the 25 I have access to screen so it

186
00:08:11,788 --> 00:08:15,209
makes sense that I would use bags a lot

187
00:08:13,379 --> 00:08:17,098
of people when it's easy not to use bags

188
00:08:15,209 --> 00:08:18,388
so when a you don't have a schwack of

189
00:08:17,098 --> 00:08:20,968
them but when you have a schwack of them

190
00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:22,348
it's hard not to use them especially

191
00:08:20,968 --> 00:08:23,939
when you have a microscope like mine and

192
00:08:22,348 --> 00:08:25,439
I go to photograph the resin and I see

193
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:27,408
these little bits and pieces and I know

194
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:29,879
in the long run of likes

195
00:08:27,408 --> 00:08:32,250
inhaling vaporizing and it's not really

196
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:34,320
affecting it but from the photography

197
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:37,049
standpoint it really affects it a great

198
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,760
deal this has had like a two and a half

199
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:40,949
month cure you can just smell oh yeah

200
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:44,069
it's definitely not very nice cure to it

201
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:47,700
it smells excited to do a little médicos

202
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:49,589
press here I'm excited I mean I like

203
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:52,040
that you've been waiting hi I'll be

204
00:08:49,589 --> 00:08:52,040
waiting

205
00:08:52,909 --> 00:08:57,769
nothing to be missed it's good having a

206
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:59,060
little short puff Wednesday you guys

207
00:08:57,769 --> 00:09:01,220
have been asking for it for the longest

208
00:08:59,059 --> 00:09:03,019
time I had no idea let's get that all in

209
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:05,450
there I had no idea when it would

210
00:09:03,019 --> 00:09:08,210
possibly happen but today John was able

211
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:11,060
to make it over well you were in town I

212
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:13,160
was in town that too he flies I fly

213
00:09:11,059 --> 00:09:16,309
you're somewhere I'm somewhere this is

214
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:18,529
true this is true there's so many events

215
00:09:16,309 --> 00:09:20,299
so many things happening I mean you got

216
00:09:18,529 --> 00:09:21,919
some great great things happening coming

217
00:09:20,299 --> 00:09:26,389
up in the near future here you go in the

218
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:28,009
discussion but what the ACCE yeah yeah

219
00:09:26,389 --> 00:09:30,470
those guys are doing good things I'm

220
00:09:28,009 --> 00:09:32,299
definitely excited I think we're doing

221
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:34,250
that in the next couple of days I'll put

222
00:09:32,299 --> 00:09:37,069
the link up to those to that

223
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:39,919
organization Cory and Tony doing great

224
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:41,480
things in Ontario we're gonna be doing

225
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:43,069
think they're doing education so they're

226
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,500
having gatherings where they have people

227
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:48,530
over and specialists in their fields to

228
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:49,909
talk about the different aspects of

229
00:09:48,529 --> 00:09:52,220
whether you're they're doing edibles

230
00:09:49,909 --> 00:09:54,049
whether they're doing hash making and so

231
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:55,639
I'm gonna do a little trichome seminar

232
00:09:54,049 --> 00:09:57,199
and then I'm gonna run them through the

233
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:59,000
bubble bags while they actually run it

234
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,650
back so it should be pretty fun what do

235
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,090
you think there John Mitty cush doesn't

236
00:10:00,649 --> 00:10:04,449
that just is that a pillow that you

237
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:04,450
could sleep with

238
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:12,619
five grams

239
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,209
all right so I guess the plan is for us

240
00:10:15,929 --> 00:10:20,099
to actually have a rip we had our pan

241
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:21,899
ribs but let's have a DAB let's do it

242
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:24,528
then up to offer you a DAB John so

243
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:28,379
actually I was also going to say this is

244
00:10:24,528 --> 00:10:30,419
69% humidity in this but it definitely

245
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:33,060
feels like it has a lot of humidity yeah

246
00:10:30,419 --> 00:10:33,929
doesn't feel like it's crunchy in any

247
00:10:33,059 --> 00:10:36,479
way shape or form

248
00:10:33,929 --> 00:10:41,399
it's very formable malleable if you

249
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:42,959
would I've found that when it was lower

250
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:44,940
humidity or what they give me in the

251
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:47,039
wrong

252
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:49,290
and this is just the humidity I liked

253
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:51,299
and I was curing my room and then I took

254
00:10:49,289 --> 00:10:53,309
some bugs off the plant was curing yeah

255
00:10:51,299 --> 00:10:56,549
I looked out my humidifier on the wall

256
00:10:53,309 --> 00:10:59,189
it had like it was at 70% no like went

257
00:10:56,549 --> 00:11:00,289
inside next question I was like that's

258
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:03,360
pretty awesome

259
00:11:00,289 --> 00:11:05,490
all right there's a little dab e4u of

260
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:12,360
the sauce from blind-eye productions

261
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:13,409
thanks guys and Johnny betta not too big

262

267
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:25,319
nice little guy for you oh I guess we

268
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:28,170

00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,610

00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:33,180
seconds said 29 seconds so far sorry I

272
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:34,919
should have put that over a little

273
00:11:33,179 --> 00:11:37,289
closer to you now I haven't had a chance

274
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:41,519
to dig bangers yet I'm kind of waiting

275
00:11:37,289 --> 00:11:42,120

296
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,769
your pen was monster

297
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,909
but from the label de panamá not

298
00:13:03,259 --> 00:13:07,840
watching told you the same thing

299
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:09,969
you get formed so reps do it man

300
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:14,259
that's important especially when you're

301
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:16,899
dealing with it's what we like whatever

302
00:13:14,259 --> 00:13:18,460
you're dealing with all right so I'm

303
00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:20,169
gonna have a little dab with you there

304
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:22,000
and then we're gonna take that we're

305
00:13:20,169 --> 00:13:24,399
gonna go into the office and we're gonna

306
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,919
stick that on the m1 I could also bring

307
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:29,079
the m1 out here it's easy enough I mean

308
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:33,338
one's so portable it's amazing it's

309
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:35,020
insane actually I know we'll see

310
00:13:33,339 --> 00:13:37,930
it might just stay on my desk but I'm

311
00:13:35,019 --> 00:13:39,970
gonna have this rip first and Johnny B

312
00:13:37,929 --> 00:13:42,338
will be hitting his 10 because this is a

313
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:47,430
pup Wednesday not a not tough Wednesday

314
00:13:42,339 --> 00:13:50,740
we puff Wednesday's our special days

315
00:13:47,429 --> 00:13:52,088
special puff day I'm looking forward to

316
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:55,330
seeing the Maddy cush squished through

317
00:13:52,089 --> 00:13:56,710
the Sasquatch press - so looking forward

318
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:58,509
to it because that means squishing at

319
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:59,800
home mm-hmm and I'll be testing all

320
00:13:58,509 --> 00:14:01,210
these different things but I haven't had

321
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:03,849
a chance to sit down with the Sasquatch

322
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:05,320
to truly test my resin because we know

323
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:07,839
that the Sasquatch is giving us exactly

324
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:10,390
what we need it's getting all over that

325
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:12,700
resin oh we're like Alex I use a

326
00:14:10,389 --> 00:14:16,360
handheld clamp and it's it's not as

327
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:17,650
powerful as a sasquatch so I'm dying I

328
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,700
want to know how much resin I'm actually

329
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:20,490
losing

330
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:23,230
you know like that's the whole question

331
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:27,580
when you're not using the proper tools

332
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:32,340
you actually lose in the squish so let's

333
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:32,340
find out exactly the amount of pressure

334
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:45,240
what do you think your return will be

335
00:14:39,929 --> 00:14:50,469
I'm hoping what do you think it'll be

336
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:52,240
it's gonna be the mid 20 25 or so number

337
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:53,769
so good that John was putting that on

338
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,289
the scale a multitude of times because

339
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:58,360
somehow in our stone stupor we filled

340
00:14:56,289 --> 00:15:04,559
this with 6 grams instead of 5 that

341
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:04,560
really affected those results

342
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:18,099
all right well do you want to compress

343
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:20,170
this I did all right all right so we've

344
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:22,180
got the M once a squash press that we're

345
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:24,849
gonna be using today with the SPX Power

346
00:15:22,179 --> 00:15:26,919
Team this one's really good it's

347
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:30,330
substantially better than the original

348
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:33,399
one the ESC Oh which I have right here

349
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:35,800
this one you have to pump twice for

350
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:38,019
every one that you have to pump this one

351
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:40,240
of us so that like foot pedal in the

352
00:15:38,019 --> 00:15:42,610
background and my Dewald air compressor

353
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:46,269
right here but that runs the bubble man

354
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:47,320
world v2 here that I have we're not

355
00:15:46,269 --> 00:15:50,409
gonna be using that one today we're

356
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:53,260
gonna be using the m1 and Johnny B

357
00:15:50,409 --> 00:15:55,269
usually clicks out at about 230 degrees

358
00:15:53,259 --> 00:15:57,639
when he squishes his bud so today we're

359
00:15:55,269 --> 00:16:00,629
gonna test he's using a you know

360
00:15:57,639 --> 00:16:04,809
handheld unit we're using an actual

361
00:16:00,629 --> 00:16:06,070
product release from sasquatch we'll see

362
00:16:04,809 --> 00:16:09,750
what the difference is in regards to

363
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:15,129
returns we've got 5 grams of Medi Kush

364
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:16,419
that we've got in here and yeah I guess

365
00:16:15,129 --> 00:16:20,100
it's time to get it in there what do you

366
00:16:16,419 --> 00:16:20,099
say John Wow super excited

367
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:35,949
all right so I love the fact that they

368
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:38,290
can just hand pump this which is so

369
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:40,390
convenient they first have to put the

370
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:42,759
air in so now a couple of pumps is just

371
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:46,899
to like relief really right yeah so now

372
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:57,909
you'll see it's only a few pumps that it

373
00:16:46,899 --> 00:17:00,419
takes so just kind of like when the

374
00:16:57,909 --> 00:17:03,370
muezzin mind my girlie

375
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:05,349
what's it well I'm sitting at home and I

376
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:06,939
had my clamp between my legs I pull up

377
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:09,669
my hair straight in there I clip

378
00:17:06,939 --> 00:17:12,040
everything together and it's just just

379
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:16,890
the way the function like I squish for

380
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:21,959
like to exist I've seen it what's that

381
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:21,959
exist yeah

382
00:18:01,349 --> 00:18:11,259
you want to lift this out press one

383
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:13,779
let's go see what we got

384
00:18:11,259 --> 00:18:20,140
oh look at the quality of it though

385
00:18:13,779 --> 00:18:21,599
Johnny B looks incredible smells

386
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:24,330
incredible

387
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:30,839
you'll be dabbing it soon enough

388
00:18:24,329 --> 00:18:30,839
we'll be dabbing in service correct

389
00:18:33,809 --> 00:18:40,240
take the second squish squish I already

390
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:43,480
see it getting a little shiny this is

391
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:55,450
kind of a pre squish you taught me to

392
00:18:43,480 --> 00:19:00,940
pre squish so it's quite likely you'll

393
00:18:55,450 --> 00:19:04,509
get a another 0.5 out of this instantly

394
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:07,690
it sees already squishing yeah it's

395
00:19:04,509 --> 00:19:11,890
squishing pretty good see I woulda never

396
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:13,930
known to press it the second time well

397
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:15,460
often you can get the whole press and

398
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:16,960
the first time but it's all about the

399
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:19,269
sweet spot you know I think for the

400
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:22,029
humidity that you have in there we could

401
00:19:19,269 --> 00:19:24,579
have made it a little hotter I think

402
00:19:22,029 --> 00:19:26,589
that's why the 220 230 is working for

403
00:19:24,579 --> 00:19:28,000
you because you have so much excessive

404
00:19:26,589 --> 00:19:30,250
humidity in there that you're just

405
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,809
blasting it it's it's evaporating and

406
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:34,240
then it's carrying the resin out for you

407
00:19:31,809 --> 00:19:36,129
not so it makes a lot more so see how

408
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:40,390
much nicer now that all that humidity is

409
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:42,550
gone how it's squishing oh yeah and

410
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:45,460
that's you could definitely see it

411
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:48,668
gushing now so you know learning and

412
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:50,528
humidity is really key to like and like

413
00:19:48,669 --> 00:19:51,788
I said that I didn't really know so I

414
00:19:50,528 --> 00:19:54,069
really wanted to try it on the side

415
00:19:51,788 --> 00:19:55,869
different tools you know devtools

416
00:19:54,069 --> 00:19:57,609
exactly different I wouldn't try to

417
00:19:55,869 --> 00:19:59,469
change it for what you're using cuz it

418
00:19:57,609 --> 00:20:00,819
won't be probably as efficient

419
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:06,730
you know you figured out a way to get

420
00:20:00,819 --> 00:20:09,519
what you have working efficiently just

421
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:10,450
so that's good this is what I kind of

422
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:12,158
want to see the beginning I was a little

423
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:14,288
disappointed but Lee said the second

424
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:16,090
squish the second Paul in the bag always

425
00:20:14,288 --> 00:20:18,250
seemed to get more you know I mean yeah

426
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:19,990
you get that first little really nice

427
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:23,859
but it's always that second pull so

428
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:25,960
remember squish once squish twice yeah

429
00:20:23,859 --> 00:20:27,369
or you know eventually you could get to

430
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,509
your point I mean if we squish the

431
00:20:27,369 --> 00:20:30,398
24-percent

432
00:20:28,509 --> 00:20:34,179
I probably would have been like I think

433
00:20:30,398 --> 00:20:57,668
we got it all yes that does happen all

434
00:20:34,179 --> 00:21:00,038
right you see there's a little and they

435
00:20:57,669 --> 00:21:05,830
kind of burst it a tiny bit so they

436
00:21:00,038 --> 00:21:07,929
right at the back here all right way

437
00:21:05,829 --> 00:21:16,058
this the first bit here was that point

438
00:21:07,929 --> 00:21:18,220
focus yes collected that it's already

439
00:21:16,058 --> 00:21:26,700
turning to a shatter lake substance as

440
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:37,990
well so another point five got you 20%

441
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:41,620
what six even point six solid its paste

442
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:44,710
solid absolutely yes

443
00:21:41,619 --> 00:21:49,859
would be as well - I'm quite happy for

444
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:49,860
us to go out right now and have your

445
00:21:50,369 --> 00:21:55,899
that beautiful view you're not gorgeous

446
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:57,099
I mean I'm the camera guy right now so I

447
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:59,169
get to come out here and take a look

448
00:21:57,099 --> 00:22:01,798
about sun's shining but it's definitely

449
00:21:59,169 --> 00:22:13,538
just one of those views that are epic I

450
00:22:01,798 --> 00:22:16,119
get to see this all the time that was

451
00:22:13,538 --> 00:22:18,490
pretty awesome yeah that was good we got

452
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:20,798
a couple of half gram squishes real nice

453
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:23,200
done there and once again you teaching

454
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:25,450
me stuff what we're learning stuff

455
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,970
together stuff together we've got our

456
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:31,240
pens we've got the dabber let's uh let's

457
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:33,370
hit some of that first backage be my

458
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:40,058
goodness look at this many push for the

459
00:22:33,369 --> 00:22:45,038
wind it's hard like hard Safi it's hard

460
00:22:40,058 --> 00:22:47,109
like Cathy big toffee and it does fold

461
00:22:45,038 --> 00:22:51,210
like a taffy like you know that toffee

462
00:22:47,109 --> 00:22:51,209
we can snap it or oppose nicely

463
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:58,428
well put that somewhere so far away from

464
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:00,110
me I'm just taking a nice little baby

465
00:22:58,429 --> 00:23:03,620
one Oh baby

466
00:23:00,109 --> 00:23:05,509
we do lots of those so you know what

467
00:23:03,619 --> 00:23:11,439
quite happy to see how that was squish

468
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:14,658
you know my timer my fault oh well I

469
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:16,100
figured you might actually things you'd

470
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:17,179
be all over it it doesn't really work

471
00:23:16,099 --> 00:23:23,089
that well Wow

472
00:23:17,179 --> 00:23:23,750
I don't know anytime I swipe up from the

473
00:23:23,089 --> 00:23:33,138
bottom

474
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:35,659
even from the clothes that [ __ ] I had no

475
00:23:33,138 --> 00:23:36,398
idea can actually I think your phone

476
00:23:35,659 --> 00:23:41,720
just died

477
00:23:36,398 --> 00:23:43,928
am I wrong or can I just not see there

478
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,929
it is

479
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:54,120
stop watch boom boom alright so give me

480
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:56,820
20 seconds you keep this up

481
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:59,039
20 seconds for the heat up so I always

482
00:23:56,819 --> 00:24:01,470
question the heat up is there a time do

483
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:03,720
you make it like a red hot you make it

484
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:05,460
so it's blowing somebody out of glass it

485
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:07,319
depends on the size of the banger it

486
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:10,710
depends on the size of the banger so the

487
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:13,200
double XL banger his isn't going red and

488
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:17,309
22nd oh no I'm definitely not that's

489
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:18,960
what I've been doing you can leave it oh

490
00:24:17,309 --> 00:24:22,319
wait another 50 seconds so in a minute

491
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,970
10 seconds I'll hit my dad now I have a

492
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:26,039
quartz banger at home is that kind of

493
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:26,400
like it's like degrading it's kind of

494
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:28,200
weird

495
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,720
so I had questionable that we were

496
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:33,600
actually talking to well I'd say I was

497
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:35,610
talking to some other glass boys and and

498
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:37,619
these cheaper quartz bangers to fix the

499
00:24:35,609 --> 00:24:39,539
crushed quartz and they made in China

500
00:24:37,619 --> 00:24:41,609
and then they kind of fused together so

501
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:43,259
they knew overtime to be grating start

502
00:24:41,609 --> 00:24:45,119
coming apart like especially if you heat

503
00:24:43,259 --> 00:24:48,990
it up red-hot and then it has the banger

504
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:50,519
heated up red-hot so as you know mine

505
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:51,870
are coming apart as you can hear what's

506
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:53,940
going on here

507
00:24:51,869 --> 00:24:54,929
you've got the hole you've got the

508
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:56,880
breakdown though you know why it's

509
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:58,440
happening I put I had to you know you

510
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,720
gonna learn that stuff so that was the

511
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:03,779
breakdown and I was actually using her

512
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:08,400
like high-end torches for heating up my

513
00:25:03,779 --> 00:25:12,299
banger so I did take it to that extreme

514
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:13,740
limit and well I'm learning there's

515
00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:15,299
cheap quartz bangers that I made from

516
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:16,950
cross courts and then there's real

517
00:25:15,299 --> 00:25:19,019
quartz bangers that cost you hundreds of

518
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:25,080
dollars and that's the reason why cheap

519
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:26,670
is cheap it's so true it's hard to get

520
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:28,859
around to no matter how hard people try

521
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:35,190
no it's just you're not gonna get around

522
00:25:28,859 --> 00:25:38,009
some people strong [ __ ] I'm learning as

523
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:39,720
we all are brother especially with how

524
00:25:38,009 --> 00:25:42,029
fast things are changing now in the

525
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,920
scene in the industry it's like anyone

526
00:25:42,029 --> 00:25:45,899
that says there they aren't learning is

527
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:48,960
going to be left behind

528
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:50,400
I said we're always scratching the

529
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,990
surface of the supplant that we're

530
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,030
researching it's just marvelous to see

531
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:55,740
how things are actually the things are

532
00:25:54,029 --> 00:25:57,269
catapulting now into the industry and

533
00:25:55,740 --> 00:26:00,569
people and just like

534
00:25:57,269 --> 00:26:02,009
yeah position yeah they're in full

535
00:26:00,569 --> 00:26:02,759
spread seeing who can make it to the

536
00:26:02,009 --> 00:26:07,259
finish line

537
00:26:02,759 --> 00:26:09,359
we're sitting back like this well we're

538
00:26:07,259 --> 00:26:14,369

trying to be with the perfect low temp

568
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:51,210

roots too damn near took it all in the

572
00:27:58,019 --> 00:28:03,049
first it's pretty good job pretty good

573
00:28:00,299 --> 00:28:03,049
that was Daisy

574
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:11,839
that was tasty stuff that was your stuff

575
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:11,839
man is your medicine

576
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:22,519
by trying so many different ways you

577
00:28:20,038 --> 00:28:22,519
know it's like

578
00:28:23,829 --> 00:28:26,699
it's interesting

579
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:30,620
or just the flavors were they using

580
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:32,720
different presses or different

581
00:28:30,619 --> 00:28:34,639
temperatures because it's definitely a

582
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:37,160
different flavor from that press the

583
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,809
public amis the president usually but

584
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:44,720
not by much is just he's more profoundly

585
00:28:38,808 --> 00:28:47,089
I don't know maybe I just really needed

586
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:52,910
that too I think you did I think it was

587
00:28:47,089 --> 00:28:54,798
great right there you go lay back and

588
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:57,558
relax on the puffs winds they fall is in

589
00:28:54,798 --> 00:28:58,789
the air John and you know it was a

590
00:28:57,558 --> 00:29:00,349
beautiful summer here in British

591
00:28:58,789 --> 00:29:02,210
Columbia although the fires have been

592
00:29:00,349 --> 00:29:04,490
very intense so we are welcoming the

593
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:06,440
rain of course has backcountry people

594
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:08,298
and snowboards ski type people we're

595
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:09,798
gonna be welcoming the precipitation

596
00:29:08,298 --> 00:29:15,379
because that ends up being snow on the

597
00:29:09,798 --> 00:29:18,308
mountains snow on the mountains but yeah

598
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:20,510
fall is a unique period it's kind of

599
00:29:18,308 --> 00:29:21,918
there's not a lot that you can do you

600
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:23,900
can't really go mountain biking it

601
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:25,730
becomes dangerous downhill dirt biking

602
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:28,090
becomes something cold and wet although

603
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:35,000
you can't still do it

604
00:29:28,089 --> 00:29:36,289
fishing fishing yeah fish but yeah it's

605
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,029
just kind of falling you know it's a

606
00:29:36,289 --> 00:29:39,798
like an in-between stage where we're

607
00:29:38,029 --> 00:29:44,269
like okay I'm just looking at the trio's

608
00:29:39,798 --> 00:29:45,829
changing colors they are there's a lot

609
00:29:44,269 --> 00:29:48,168
of leaves already fallen on the ground

610
00:29:45,829 --> 00:29:49,699
as well not necessarily here but when

611
00:29:48,169 --> 00:29:52,130
you go into the city and stuff you see

612
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:53,600
whole parks that are like it's like you

613
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:56,380
can't believe how many leaves are on the

614
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:58,759
ground it's pretty wild

615
00:29:56,380 --> 00:30:00,260
well what do you say Johnny B should we

616
00:29:58,759 --> 00:30:05,089
call it a day and let you get on your

617
00:30:00,259 --> 00:30:08,240
way I think that wraps up for nice chill

618
00:30:05,089 --> 00:30:10,759
puffs Wednesday I'll take a couple macro

619
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,069
shots of the bud and take some close-up

620
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:14,319
video and we'll

621
00:30:12,069 --> 00:30:17,609
we call it a wrap thanks for watching

622
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:17,609
everybody see you next time

623

[Music]

624
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:33,789
Sony's strike like seen as the margin

625
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:37,089
break my game is open why this one was

626
00:30:33,789 --> 00:30:39,960
up in my face the wisdom of the way my

627
00:30:37,089 --> 00:30:39,959
gets that straight

628
