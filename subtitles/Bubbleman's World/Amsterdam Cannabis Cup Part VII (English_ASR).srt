4
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:28,960

00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:32,439
venue it's all good no

00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,439

00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:45,600
event I'm happy that they left me off

10
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:46,840
the floor plane I feel really bad for my

11
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,600

12
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:52,359

my colleague s on the phone yesterday

14
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:55,879
because this is nonsense and it's not

15
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:58,079
fair and it should be a proper event

16
00:00:55,878 --> 00:01:00,479
should be like the Dao last night eating

17

18
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:04,359
together it was an amazing event and

19
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:06,399
