protected that have been brought up here

their pieces can be shown as the

15
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:08,079
incredible art that they are rather than

16
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:11,158
being persecuted as uh drug device

17
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:15,599

[Music]

27

[Music]

28
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:58,479
and and you get to hold it in your hands

29
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,120
it's awesome because you never could

30
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:01,560
hold that that moment is cool it's a

31
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,560
really interesting moment because it's

32
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,439
like you can touch the glass and feel

33
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,400
the texture and like feel the form in

34
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:08,719
your hand and understand it that gives

35
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,599
you a whole new understanding of the

36
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:12,199
glass honestly you know like cuz it's

37
00:03:10,598 --> 00:03:13,959
one thing to look at the glass but run

38
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:15,958
your finger around the surface to feel

39
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:17,920
it cuz some glass purposely not smoth

40
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:19,959
some of they purposely totally smooth

41
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:21,919
shapes and like when you're a glass

42
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:23,280
blower and you stare on a piece of glass

43
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:24,518
while you're working it we have a

44
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,878
different perception you look at the

45
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:27,760
wall thickness in a way that I don't

46
00:03:25,878 --> 00:03:30,158
think Norm people normally look at you

47
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:31,079
know what I'm saying because

48
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:35,399
I don't

49
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:36,840
know yeah yeah but to hold that piece

50
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:41,560
and feel the technical it's Chris

51
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:43,840
McElroy my man what's the deal

52
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:45,000
Chris so your piece you have a wall

53
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,360
hanging here is the last thing we have

54
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,490
not put up cuz I don't know how to put

55
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,650

who's responsible for all of this chaos

101
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,680
here tonight although the chaos is seems

102
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,480
to be getting under

103
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:17,799
control what what have you created what

104
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,680
what kind of a beast is this that you've

105
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:21,278
built well I didn't really build

106
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:24,000
anything I'm just trying to actually

107
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:25,000
bring together um kind of a whole

108
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,919
movement that's sort of been an

109
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,919
invisible culture for a long time which

110
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:29,479
I don't know I'm kind of calling the

111
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:32,039
glass pipe art movement for lack of a

112
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:33,440
better better term but it's basically uh

113
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:35,199
a bunch of artists that Express

114
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,160
themselves using uh lamp work Boral

115
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,440
silicate glass and um uh they make lots

116
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:42,838
of different stuff but a lot of us got

117
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:45,200
involved with glass or Express um

118
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:47,399
ourselves through really intricate uh

119
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,360
glass pipes so just putting that

120
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:52,000
together in the setting of an art show

121
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:55,039
to honor these uh pipe makers as artists

122
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,440
and um check out in one place all the

123
00:10:55,039 --> 00:11:00,000
different styles and Aesthetics and uh

124
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,120
and that have developed uh in the art SC

125
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,600
basically the couple of blowers that

126
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:07,600
I've chatted with so far seem so stoked

127
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:10,639
to have somebody um want to showcase

128
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,159
their work and showcase them as artists

129
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:13,720
you know like few people seem a bit

130
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:16,120
chuffed you know and that's that's

131
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:18,240
[Â __Â ] excellent I think um the thing

132
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,959
is is a lot of people are just unaware

133
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,440
um that this whole culture exists and

134
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:23,679
that um that that pipes glass pipes have

135
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,440
gotten to a point where they're more

136
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:28,278
than just something that's functional

137
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,880
but they're used as a a term a medium of

138
00:11:28,278 --> 00:11:32,039
artistic expression like lots of other

139
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:33,360
functional objects have been used

140
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:35,199
throughout many different cultures

141
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,519
throughout history um of people

142
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,560
expressing themselves artistically

143
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:39,639
through a functional object um people

144
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:41,159
have been expressing themselves with

145
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:42,759
through pipes throughout history in all

146
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:45,719
different types of cultures Native

147
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:48,240
Americans made pipes uh African tribes

148
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,639
made made different types of pipes um

149
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:54,079
and those were a lot of the first

150
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:56,919
examples of of of uh cultural artwork or

151
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:58,958
um folk art and um this is just another

152
00:11:56,919 --> 00:12:02,319
part of that historical cultural cycle

153
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:03,919
um a culture that a lot stems from

154
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,440
Grateful Dead culture and the Grateful

155
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:08,958
Dead lot and people just making small

156
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,320
functional pipes but being inspired by

157
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:11,719
lots of different aspects to want to

158
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,360
make them more decorative and and

159
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:16,480
express themselves through that um it's

160
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:18,759
actually really interesting to to to ask

161
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,959
each individual their motivation of why

162
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:21,159
they want to make a pipe in the first

163
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:23,198
place because a lot of these people are

164
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:25,360
people who could have such a high level

165
00:12:23,198 --> 00:12:26,519
of proficiency with the medium of glass

166
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,360
and are also getting to a point

167
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:30,198
expressing themselves as artists where

168
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:32,320
they could easily make it a functional

169
00:12:30,198 --> 00:12:34,278
pipe and they could Market themselves to

170
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,360
a whole different audience you know the

171
00:12:34,278 --> 00:12:38,679
more

172
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,959
mainstream um just culture um and also

173
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:41,319
you know there's the complications of

174
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:43,599
things like operation pipe dreams and

175
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:45,399
John Ashcraft and the uh whole gray area

176
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,000
of legality that makes you wonder why

177
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:49,559
would artists that have such visions and

178
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,839
have such skill levels with this glass

179
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:53,518
want to still make it so it could

180
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:55,040
function as a pipe and that's um what is

181
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,919
your answer to that question for

182
00:12:55,039 --> 00:13:01,519
yourself as an artist honestly I got

183
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:04,479
into into to Glass the idea of making a

184
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:07,360
functional pipe um so for the function

185
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,199
of the pipe um once I started playing

186
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,199
with as as an artist I was an artist

187
00:13:09,198 --> 00:13:13,240
before I got into the medium of glass I

188
00:13:11,198 --> 00:13:15,000
discovered the medium of glass um I

189
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,879
looked at it really more at first as a

190
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,440
craft and as a way that I could just

191
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,838
honestly make a living by creating

192
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,399
something with my hands and selling it

193
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:23,560
as opposed to having a job so at first

194
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:24,759
it was more a monetary thing yet I was

195
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:27,119
interested in the meeting and learning

196
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:29,278
medium and learning it so making pipes

197
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,440
enabled me to every time I made a pipe

198
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:33,039
that was a lesson in lamp workking glass

199
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,680
and understanding how the glass flows

200
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:37,278
and blowing the glass and every time I

201
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:38,638
could pipe was a very sellable thing so

202
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:41,439
when I can sell that I could afford to

203
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:43,120
buy more materials I could afford to buy

204
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,920
keep myself going with the medium

205
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,720
because it's very expensive the glass

206
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:50,319
materials that have the overhead of a

207
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:52,000
glass shop to um uh every aspect of it

208
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,680
just to actually have a kiln and the

209
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,639
Torches and everything and um and that's

210
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:58,399
before you've even created something so

211
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,320
what it is was every single pipe was a

212
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,759
lesson in learning how to do it like the

213
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,680
the roots of the glass that we use is

214
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:06,720
more in a scientific thing well we use

215
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:08,198
borosilicate glass which is uh people

216
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,920
know it's Pyrex which is just a brand

217
00:14:08,198 --> 00:14:12,838
name for borosilicate glass

218
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:14,278
traditionally um a lot of uh the

219
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:15,560
borosilicate glass there's lots of

220
00:14:14,278 --> 00:14:17,000
different types of glass that are used

221
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:18,838
for different reasons to create

222
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,240
different things so for instance some

223
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:21,360
people like the most common form of

224
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,159
glass blowing is blowing out of a

225
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:26,039
furnace so you could blow very large

226
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:28,278
stuff by gathering um big gathers of

227
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:30,000
already hot molten glass um but that

228
00:14:28,278 --> 00:14:31,958
glass works at a lower temperature so we

229
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,480
can stay molten the glass we use is

230
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:35,518
harder glass that works at a hotter

231
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:37,440
temperature so you know You' you know

232
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,600
you use Pyrex plates in a microwave or

233
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,759
you can use them uh they're they're cook

234
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,360
safe and and um so you they're also used

235
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:44,919
in Laboratories and buns and burners and

236
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:48,480
a lot you traditionally they're used

237
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:50,719
more mostly for scientific apparatus um

238
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,480
besides that artistically you've

239
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,920
probably seen people lamp working Boral

240
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,159
cic glass maybe in a mall um or at a

241
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:58,679
carnival making mostly little types of

242
00:14:57,159 --> 00:15:01,240
trinkets or at Disney World making

243
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:04,319
Donald ducks and Mickey Mouses um it's

244
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:07,039
just in the last I'd say 25 years or

245
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:09,120
even less that people have started using

246
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:11,278
this actual type of working glass and

247
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,159
this sty this type of glass to express

248
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:15,519
themselves more artistically as opposed

249
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:17,319
to scientifically um now the

250
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:19,399
interestingly enough the reason that

251
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:20,920
pipes are used this type of glass is

252
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:22,278
because of the function um if you're

253
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:24,240
going to use a lighter and light the

254
00:15:22,278 --> 00:15:26,000
pipe constantly if it's going to be the

255
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,079
soft a softer type of glass not Boral

256
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,480
silicate but a different type like

257
00:15:27,078 --> 00:15:31,318
furnace glass it will crack due to

258
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,560
stress of having too much too much heat

259
00:15:31,318 --> 00:15:37,318
on it so this type of glass we use to

260
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:40,559
create functional pipes um is is from a

261
00:15:37,318 --> 00:15:42,599
SC comes from a scientific Roots now as

262
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:43,518
pipe makers and people inspired by

263
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,879
everything everyone has their own

264
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,799
inspiration CH so I can't speak for

265
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:48,919
everyone but a lot of us Trace Our Roots

266
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:52,240
to a man named Bob Snodgrass who is one

267
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:54,120
of the first people that was actually uh

268
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,879
trying to put some kind of coloration in

269
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:58,078
the pipes using gold and silver fuming

270
00:15:55,879 --> 00:16:00,720
which is the famous color changing pipe

271
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:02,519
phenomenon um and he was also involved

272
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,319
in going on tour with the Grateful Dead

273
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:06,600
and selling his small color changing

274
00:16:04,318 --> 00:16:08,919
pipes there on the Grateful Dead lot

275
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:11,519
which got a whole psychedelic culture

276
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:12,799
interested um Mor at first through the C

277
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,679
through the function but then if you

278
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:16,278
think about what people were smoking

279
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:18,519
through those pipes and about that sort

280
00:16:16,278 --> 00:16:20,919
of the Grateful Dead scene and the

281
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:22,799
artistic movement surrounding that that

282
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:25,278
just bled over to pipes and young people

283
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:26,879
who would don't want to who want to be

284
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:27,919
artists who want to work for themselves

285
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:29,360
maybe don't want to get a job they're

286
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:31,360
done touring with the Dead they went to

287
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,440
people like Bob Snodgrass and the people

288
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,399
he taught and that culture spread to

289
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,160
other people and the more it spread the

290
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:38,639
more people got ideas to try to make

291
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:41,879
something more these little pipes that

292
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:44,079
snotty and and his and predecessors made

293
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:45,759
were treasured little items by people

294
00:16:44,078 --> 00:16:47,679
and so it was fun to try to come up with

295
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:49,360
new Aesthetics and new ways and be

296
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:50,679
unique and people started putting their

297
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,480
signatures on them and coming with their

298
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:55,719
own Styles and from there it's just

299
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,039
going off where now if you come forward

300
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,720
another 10 or 15 years from when

301
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:01,159
Snodgrass started putting that stuff on

302
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,959
the dead lot we have all sorts of uh

303
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:05,480
actual companies that are creating

304
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:07,119
torches and and new types of color glass

305
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:09,599
that's coming out the color and pattern

306
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:11,519
the glass and and all sorts of uh

307
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,958
different techniques from other styles

308
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:14,599
of working glass are now being

309
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,640
Incorporated by these young people and

310
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:18,240
manipulated into these pipes and so

311
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,120
there there's a huge social aspect to it

312
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,160
there's a economic piece of it too

313
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:24,239
there's a huge economic piece everything

314
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,640
from uh it doesn't just stem to the

315
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,439
paraphernalia industry and people

316
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:30,799
selling glass pipes it goes even it goes

317
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:32,440
before that the prequel of that are the

318
00:17:30,798 --> 00:17:33,679
companies that are making the color

319
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,519
glass and the companies that are making

320
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,240
the Torches they've gotten to a point

321
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:39,279
where they're actually they haven't

322
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:41,400
shied they shied away at first because

323
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:43,399
of the controversy of the idea of the

324
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:45,120
culture of making glass pipes but

325
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,200
they're realizing now that that is what

326
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:47,839
their biggest Market is and they're

327
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,080
marketing directly to that I'm talking

328
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:51,000
about the color the people who make the

329
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:53,000
materials we use the technical stuff the

330
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,279
Torches the the color glass the raw

331
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,880
glass they're marketing directly to the

332
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:59,158
pipe makers because the pipe makers are

333
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:02,039
a huge percentage of their Market and

334
00:17:59,159 --> 00:18:05,000
that's the reality of it at this point

335
00:18:02,038 --> 00:18:06,919
um so the industry sh you know it's like

336
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,440
anything everything is interconnected

337
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:10,360
you know nothing is in and of itself the

338
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:13,200
pipe scene does not exist in and of

339
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:16,279
itself um and do you think that this is

340
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:18,279
the uh the this show tonight is

341
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:21,359
significant in the way that it could be

342
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:23,119
a shift in the way that um Glass artists

343
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:24,079
are perceived and the way that they're

344
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:26,199
perceived and the way that they're

345
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:27,798
exposed to the public as well you think

346
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:30,279
that we might start to see more of a

347
00:18:27,798 --> 00:18:32,319
trend of glass artist being showcased as

348
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:34,918
artists rather than next to the rolling

349
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:36,839
papers I definitely think that's the

350
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:38,640
idea that's the goal and if we're at all

351
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:39,959
successful at that then we've

352
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,200
accomplished our mission I have to give

353
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,880
a lot of uh props and thanks out to

354
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,880
another glass artist friend of mine

355
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:50,320
named Brian mcau who signed his pieces

356
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:52,720
as gasp and uh in 2003 March it was

357
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:54,798
March 9th I think 2003 he threw the

358
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,720
first ever glass pipe art show in a

359
00:18:54,798 --> 00:18:57,960
gallery down in San Francisco it was

360
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,279
actually called the melting point also

361
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:02,480
it was the inspiration for name of this

362
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:03,960
place and um he had the same idea

363
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,558
amongst us he's actually a peer of mine

364
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:07,480
that we went to art school together and

365
00:19:05,558 --> 00:19:10,240
stuff and so we knew each other before

366
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:12,599
we even blew glass pipes and anyway his

367
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,240
his uh Vision was the same as what we

368
00:19:12,599 --> 00:19:16,599
were talking here of like removing them

369
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:19,519
from the setting of next to cannabis

370
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:21,759
magazines and uh next to Rolling Papers

371
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:23,918
and next to things and see the idea is

372
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:26,240
we're trying to F have people focus on

373
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:28,240
the art and the fact that it functions

374
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,839
as a pipe honestly is secondary to these

375
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,599
artists including myself and so in

376
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:34,599
instead of if you surround if you

377
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:36,319
surround these pieces in just other

378
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:37,719
paraphernalia and propaganda that's do

379
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:39,000
with cannabis it's not necessarily that

380
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,839
I'm against that it's not necessar I'm

381
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,519
for that but what that just says is that

382
00:19:40,839 --> 00:19:45,918
this piece is used for cannabis in his

383
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:47,038
paraphernalia which is is not even

384
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,200
that's a whole another issue that I'm

385
00:19:47,038 --> 00:19:49,960
not trying to tackle in this statement

386
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:52,240
here but what I'm trying to say is by

387
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:54,079
putting the pipes on pedestals by

388
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,960
putting them next to other art pieces in

389
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:58,079
an art gallery having an actual art

390
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,558
opening that's catered that where the

391
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:01,639
artists have their titles of their names

392
00:19:59,558 --> 00:20:03,960
where they make an artist statement that

393
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:05,360
all is putting the pipes in a context

394
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:07,640
that other art traditionally has been

395
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:10,319
put in and as a result it validates

396
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:11,960
these pieces as art and not just pretty

397
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:14,000
paraphernalia or or you know what I'm

398
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,679
saying like so that's really important

399
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,558
and that's where my friend Brian AKA

400
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:20,280
gasp was starting that in San Francisco

401
00:20:17,558 --> 00:20:22,240
in 2003 he conceived this idea for his

402
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:24,319
show before operation pipe dreams

403
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,440
happened tell us about operation pipe

404
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:27,000
dreams I don't think that everybody

405
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:30,200
necessarily knows exact what the

406
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,759
parameters of that is is the name of uh

407
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,440
there was actually two operations

408
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:36,960
operation pipe dreams and operation Head

409
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:39,480
Hunter and they were particular uh

410
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,440
initiatives uh com working in

411
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:43,079
collaboration the DEA the Department of

412
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:47,519
Justice and a bunch of other government

413
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:51,558
officials um launched a a a full

414
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:53,119
Federal um investigation and finally

415
00:20:51,558 --> 00:20:56,399
they a Roundup where they ended up

416
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:57,879
arresting 51 people um we kind of have a

417
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,840
the date that they actually announced it

418
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:03,919
and launched it was February 24th 2003

419
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:05,720
um and there were a whole bunch of

420
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:09,000
different companies that were

421
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:11,679
advertising openly on the internet um to

422
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,400
sell things like you know uh glass water

423
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:17,320
pipes and uh and glass pieces and stuff

424
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,360
and uh they were paying taxes they you

425
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:20,839
know thought they were staying within

426
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:22,678
the law by uh saying people they

427
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:24,639
wouldn't sell to people under you know

428
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:25,798
not no minors no one under 18 of age

429
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,440
could be could purchase their products

430
00:21:25,798 --> 00:21:29,720
and they were for tobacco use only etc

431
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,919
etc without any warning at all the de

432
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:34,440
and the Department of Justice kicked

433
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:36,240
down the doors of these people um seized

434
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:38,200
you know a lot of their property and

435
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:41,359
their businesses and freeze their assets

436
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:42,759
and uh Tommy Chong who was uh one of the

437
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:44,798
people involved in his business his son

438
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:46,919
was running a business called uh Chong

439
00:21:44,798 --> 00:21:48,359
glass got arrested he's actually the one

440
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:50,080
person that ended up in jail a lot of

441
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:51,278
other people on house arrest some of the

442
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:52,359
more notable people I can remember off

443
00:21:51,278 --> 00:21:55,558
the top of my head that got busted were

444
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:57,599
Jerome Baker bongs or water pipes excuse

445
00:21:55,558 --> 00:22:00,678
me and uh I don't know a bunch of

446
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:03,158
different companies but 101 north um but

447
00:22:00,679 --> 00:22:04,720
yeah it was basically you the the

448
00:22:03,159 --> 00:22:06,760
federal government has a definition of

449
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,120
paraphernalia and it's kind of like in

450
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:10,319
the United States there's just like a

451
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:12,038
lot of huge gray areas and so the

452
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:14,639
federal government decided to like you

453
00:22:12,038 --> 00:22:16,240
know act on their definition and force

454
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,360
what they thought was the law in terms

455
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,440
of defining these pieces of drug

456
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:19,639
paraphernalia even though these people

457
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:21,278
thought they were within the law so

458
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:24,640
basically what they did

459
00:22:21,278 --> 00:22:27,480
was if anyone if anyone was curious

460
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:29,559
about whether or not glass pipes or

461
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,960
paraphernalia was legal or illegal they

462
00:22:29,558 --> 00:22:32,200
were trying to establish that these

463
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,360
things were illegal but it's still a

464
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,519
great area cuz there's still people

465
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:35,918
obviously arguing that they're either

466
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:37,798
for art purposes they're for tobacco

467
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:40,679
purposes they're for legal herb

468
00:22:37,798 --> 00:22:42,400
purposes um so it's you know it's one of

469
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:44,480
those things it's like but the risk has

470
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,880
increased for blowers well basically

471
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,240
what they've done is the the the the

472
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,919
federal government has said that

473
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,000
federally it's against the law the state

474
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:54,400
laws are all individual and different so

475
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,480
state by state things are different um

476
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,200
one of the things they were going after

477
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:59,519
at first mostly pipe drains was uh

478
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,519
Interstate trafficking so people who are

479
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:01,759
like doing basically they want the

480
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:04,798
people a lot of money who are sending

481
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:05,798
stuff from one state to another um what

482
00:23:04,798 --> 00:23:07,000
they what the federal government is

483
00:23:05,798 --> 00:23:08,879
doing at this point they actually

484
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,558
launched another operation one year

485
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,559
about to the date of operation pipe tram

486
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:13,960
called operation pipe cleaner where

487
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:16,119
they're doing the same sort of thing

488
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:18,720
they're basically uh they're encouraging

489
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:21,319
local law enforcement to go in and clean

490
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,798
up their local area if they so choose so

491
00:23:21,319 --> 00:23:23,798
police and all sorts of different areas

492
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:25,278
and we're getting reports from

493
00:23:23,798 --> 00:23:27,798
everywhere all over the United States

494
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:28,960
all places in Texas to Virginia to

495
00:23:27,798 --> 00:23:31,558
Upstate New York

496
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:34,159
to Illinois Detroit all different random

497
00:23:31,558 --> 00:23:36,918
places I incidents of local law

498
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:39,278
enforcement deciding to give warnings or

499
00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:42,080
confiscate pieces or Raid places so it's

500
00:23:39,278 --> 00:23:43,759
kind of like you know based on the local

501
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:45,000
the local constituents but the federal

502
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:47,640
government is giving their full blessing

503
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,200
and encouraging it um so it's not only

504
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,880
is a something that happened like in

505
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,960
2003 but now we're in 2004 and they're

506
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,080
continuing the initiative so there's a

507
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:57,319
huge gray area a lot of all the we

508
00:23:55,079 --> 00:23:58,558
almost almost all the websites that at

509
00:23:57,319 --> 00:24:00,439
least coming out of the United States

510
00:23:58,558 --> 00:24:02,480
that sell anything that that you could

511
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,880
be considered for paraphernalia no

512
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:07,839
matter what they're pretty much you know

513
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:12,440
shut down um glasspipes.org is uh is a

514
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:14,319
is a nonprofit um uh Gallery page that

515
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:16,480
uh some people have put together that

516
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:18,319
any glass pipe artist is uh welcome to

517
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,919
start a gallery and display their work

518
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:21,158
and so it's kind of open so a lot of the

519
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,360
stuff has been being channeled through

520
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:25,480

pros know what were you saying about

555
00:27:51,798 --> 00:27:56,278
those books you were looking at with the

556
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:59,320
pipes and art or whatever tribal books

557
00:27:56,278 --> 00:28:02,440
that have been around for you know they

558
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:04,720
show these pieces that are hundreds you

559
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:08,120
know sometimes thousands of years old

560
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:09,919
you know ppes they there I mean and they

561
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:13,518
weren't just a functional thing they had

562
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:15,080
art on them know car they spent time

563
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:17,480
making them and you have to remember

564
00:28:15,079 --> 00:28:21,000
that like most of them are ceremonial

565
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:23,319
pipes so like they're meant to be used

566
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,240
you know in very specific yeah very

567
00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:30,200
specific times something you know like

568
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:33,558
Christmas Easter I think a a lot of the

569
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:35,880
first it seems like I wonder when when

570
00:28:33,558 --> 00:28:37,558
did the idea of Fine Art come in where

571
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:39,080
people made art that didn't function CU

572
00:28:37,558 --> 00:28:41,079
it seems traditionally if you look back

573
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:43,558
to like cavemen or whatever you want and

574
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:46,278
also ancient cultures come to now seems

575
00:28:43,558 --> 00:28:48,359
like traditionally the first signs of

576
00:28:46,278 --> 00:28:50,558
artistic expression came mostly in the

577
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:52,158
forms of functional things like from

578
00:28:50,558 --> 00:28:53,918
what I've read and like things that got

579
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:55,720
you intoxicated especially were made

580
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:57,679
more decorative so it be a pipe or even

581
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:59,720
just like a a vase or some kind of like

582
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:00,880
vessel would hold like intoxicating

583
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:03,679
beverage or something like that would be

584
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,240
more decorated and artistic you know but

585
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:07,840
it seems like that's like there there

586
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:09,159
wasn't like it wasn't a necessity necess

587
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:10,759
they make like a peeking hang on your

588
00:29:09,159 --> 00:29:13,278
wall or a sculpture that just expressed

589
00:29:10,759 --> 00:29:15,440
your how I felt for someone to take back

590
00:29:13,278 --> 00:29:16,798
to their cave or their Hut you know so

591
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,840
the first forms of artistic expression

592
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:19,480
we're going to lie at more of a

593
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:20,839
functional thing like everyday thing

594
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:23,120
you're using someone might start

595
00:29:20,839 --> 00:29:24,158
decorating a little more a spear or

596
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:25,239
something they drink out it or something

597
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:28,240
they smoke at it you know what I'm

598
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:28,240
saying

599
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,360
look how far we come yeah

600
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:41,159
exctly you find when you like pull the

601
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,079
camera out everything changes like I

602
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:43,880
said some people are comfortable with

603
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:45,678
cameras some people I'm going to like I

604
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:47,600
want to keep it on at all points like

605
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:49,640
hey I'm thr my camera out you need to

606

00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:53,320
look well yeah are you watching look at

608
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:56,000

609
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:57,639

610
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,640
what I'm saying yeah well that's the

611
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:01,159
thing see sh I'm like I turned the red

612
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:03,399
light off so you don't know if it's on

613
00:30:01,159 --> 00:30:05,159
or off how do I do this so that way like

614
00:30:03,398 --> 00:30:06,879
I can just roll in and be talking to

615
00:30:05,159 --> 00:30:09,000
somebody

616
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,519
sometimes I mean I would you know it's

617
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,599
like there's people that I know that are

618

like down to be interviewed and are like

619
00:30:12,599 --> 00:30:16,278

707
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:48,519
Glass art was uh up in Aspen I was

708

hanging out and I saw a Dale chahul

709
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:53,719
piece and I was like wow if I want to do

710
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:56,519
art that looks really fun and big and

711
00:37:53,719 --> 00:37:57,799
crazy and also was really expensive not

712
00:37:56,519 --> 00:38:00,599
that that mattered but I was just Blown

713
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:04,280
Away to see a piece that was had so much

714
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:05,480
value in it or worth so you inspired

715
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:08,480
like that yeah I was inspired by the

716
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:10,440
colors and stuff so that and uh yeah I

717
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:13,039
loved pipes too and I really enjoyed

718
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:15,519
that I made uh pipes out of Ceramics

719
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:17,440
before that a little bit Yeah and then

720
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:19,199
made a lot of art out of Ceramics too

721
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:21,760
but snuck some pipes in there high

722
