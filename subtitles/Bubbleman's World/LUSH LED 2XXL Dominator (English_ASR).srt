00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,719
from the size and weight this package

6
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:37,439

00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:32,759
lumens which is a comp compared to a

28
00:01:30,438 --> 00:01:35,719
1,000 wat HPS is

29
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:38,799
145,000 uh you got 3 point EV for

30
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:41,920
voltage power for 2,000 extremely

31
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:43,720

lumens and 1,000 Yoles at canopy level 2

35
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,359
in away I've heard a bunch of different

36
00:01:51,078 --> 00:01:54,519
things I'm going to be careful with my

37
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:56,718
canopy level I don't want to

38
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:59,478
burn um looks like it's got a ton of

39
00:01:56,718 --> 00:02:02,759
Lifetime hours it shows exactly how to

40
00:01:59,478 --> 00:02:05,399
set it up up uh for hanging it's pretty

following the proper instructions um

43
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,680

00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:13,719
sure if I'll video the actual hanging of

45
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,120
it we'll see what happens um this is

46
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:17,639
just the light spectrum that it has um

47
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,239
giving you in regards to the LED

48
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:22,639
lighting and then it also came with a

49
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,519

00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:34,000
two 3 4 5 6 * 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12

76
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:41,640
15 damn

77
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:46,400
50 as I got to about 36 I realized

78
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:51,000
they're all numbered each row so 50 rows

79
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:53,079
of six to eight six lights that's 300

80
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,680
lights that are in this little bad boy

81
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:57,959
they look super top quality they're tiny

82
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,760
little diodes

83
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:02,598
um sort of melted right into the metal

84
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:05,078
there plus and minus I'm really looking

85
00:04:02,598 --> 00:04:08,078
forward to trying this bad boy out I'm

86
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:10,159
going to take it over to the tent change

87
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:11,319
the camera setup and uh let's get to

88
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:14,959
that right

89
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:17,879
now okay so I now in the tent little bit

90
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:20,319
tight in here I've got the two times XL

91
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:22,120
Dominator this thing weighs serious

92
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:25,800
weight it'll be by far the heaviest

93
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:27,360
thing I've ever hung in a tent like this

94
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,520
we're going to make sure that it's

95
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,479
secure got these great little units

96
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:35,079
right here that they come with which are

97
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:38,719
quite

98
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:41,000
convenient nice strong cable and they

99
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:45,240
set it up kind of no brainer style for

100
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,240
you I guess it's two on each

101
00:04:45,478 --> 00:04:52,639
side let's see what we got here oh let's

102
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:55,079
get this somewhat upside down here all

103
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,840
right so this is a simple as you got

104
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:59,159
your

105
00:04:55,839 --> 00:05:01,638
Carabiner and we're going to hook up two

106
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,639
on each

107
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:09,560
side really nice built units you know

108
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,560
they really feel like something you

109
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:16,639
really got something with this

110
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:19,560
unit which is uh saying something these

111
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:22,120
days all right so we drop those in there

112
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:24,639
there's two on either side and there's

113
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:26,240
three sets of them so they give you

114
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,800
three of these little

115
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,360
bags this is great you know especially

116
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,960
with a light like this

117
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,639
you don't want to leave it to chance

118
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:36,879
that people are going to Jerry rig their

119
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:36,879
own sort of

120
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,720
method oh it's my little ballast that I

121
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,160
still got going on I usually try to shut

122
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,880
down all the fans while I'm filming I

123
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:50,880
could hear the fan going and I was

124
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:50,879
wondering hm what is that now I

125
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,639
know

126
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:10,439
okay and I can't tell you how excited I

127
00:06:06,918 --> 00:06:12,719
am to get this thing up and hanging and

128
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:12,719
lit

129
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:18,439
up seems like everyone's on the LED

130
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:21,800
train these days now I'm not looking to

131
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:24,639
replace all my crops with LED but in the

132
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:26,560
least I like the idea of having an LED

133
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:29,160
tent or even better I like the idea of

134
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,240
having a full spectrum tent LED metal

135
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:33,720
highlight high pressure sodium how cool

136
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:37,280
would that be I am not going to listen

137
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,800
to anyone's experiences but my own and

138
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:42,119
I'm going to play around and I'm going

139
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:47,120
to experiment and that's going to

140
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:47,120
involve different forms of lights no

141
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:52,399
problem now you've got the hours of

142
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,360
operation use this track to track the

143
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:56,878
light span of your fixture so it has a

144
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,160
start date that you're supposed to write

145
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:00,199
down and then you can use your hours

146
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,400
used

147
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:05,439
that's interesting I'm going to try and

148
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:09,079
keep a nice little journal with this guy

149
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:13,160
so let's see what we got here it's going

150
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:13,159
to be Superman styles to hang this guy

151
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:27,319
now all right and I think this one will

152
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:36,038
hang on the other

153
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:36,038
one okay and those are still hanging

154
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:42,159
good okay there we

155
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:50,120
go

156
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:53,038
exciting and this has got the power I

157
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:56,240
might need a tiny little extension cord

158
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:59,839
depending on how long this is going to

159
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,319
be oh no looks like we'll be okay so

160
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:03,560
it's a three pin

161
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:06,280
plug definitely haven't seen one like

162
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:08,199
this before has a little slot so it can

163
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:09,598
only go in the one way if you're

164
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:13,120
plugging in one of these for the first

165
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:14,759
time make sure you pay attention to that

166
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,800
that little

167
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:19,158
slot would be a good thing to pay

168
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,158
attention

169
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:27,318
to I kind of like to have this out of

170
00:08:23,598 --> 00:08:27,319
the way there but we'll see what

171
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:31,439
happens

172
00:08:36,428 --> 00:08:40,908
[Music]

173
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:54,518
there we go I think that's a little bit

174
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:57,759
more even and I can just

175
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:59,839
uh possibly tie that up to keep that

176
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:02,879
secure we just worried about the one bar

177
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:05,320
here it's a little bit lower it looks

178
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:07,320
like it's pretty secure but you know to

179
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,560
have the double bar connection I'm going

180
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,320
to get a little bit of tape and we're

181
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:14,679
going to tie that all right even

182
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:18,320
better let's get this guy turned on

183
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:23,919
let's zap strap it or Zippy strap as

184
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,920
Johnny B likes to say do a little Zippy

185
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:34,480
strapping there we go oh would you look

186
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,480

187
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:45,159
thing all right I'm going to get out of

188
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:49,200

195
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:09,879
into a high press sodium a little bit

196
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:12,359

197
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:16,720
