very nice there's no doubt about that no

192
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,598
doubt about right that we people have to

193
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,919
hide in alleys when they're medicating

194
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:38,360
and stuff like that should be able to do

195
00:07:36,918 --> 00:07:40,240
in public places and stuff where I can

196
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,598
take certain things so I mean I think

197
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,160
awareness is the biggest thing and like

198
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:45,079
you said you still look at as an illegal

199
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:47,000
system but soon to come will be a legal

200
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:48,318
system worldwide so I mean it's just

201
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,918
that's it paying attention to what's

202
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,240
happening in the news what's happening

203
