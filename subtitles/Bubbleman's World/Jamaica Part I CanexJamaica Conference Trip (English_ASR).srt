00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:37,700
but this is my first time there's about

7
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:41,080
80 of us speaking at this conference and

8
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:44,480
there is a substantial amount of people

9
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:46,250
attending over 3,000 so we have just

10
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:50,599
gotten to our place here in beautiful

11
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:52,399
Montego Bay really funny story that I

12
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,929
have to tell you guys about this house

13
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,450
that we've rented first of all it's

14
00:00:53,929 --> 00:01:00,109
beyond anything I've ever rented it's a

15
00:00:56,450 --> 00:01:03,859
huge property on on a private on a

16
00:01:00,109 --> 00:01:08,989
private big chunk of land and basically

17
00:01:03,859 --> 00:01:12,079
we rented to be Airbnb and we paid and

18
00:01:08,989 --> 00:01:14,599
we went through Airbnb locks and about

19
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:16,039
ten or twelve hours after I paid they

20
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:19,189
called me and said they made a bad

21
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:20,390
mistake and that they needed to refund

22
00:01:19,189 --> 00:01:21,679
my money and that they couldn't I

23
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:23,209
couldn't rent the house that I rented we

24
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,830
rented something much smaller than this

25
00:01:23,209 --> 00:01:26,539
much much more reasonable there's three

26
00:01:24,829 --> 00:01:27,709
of us here so we were gonna split you

27
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:29,990
know a couple hundred bucks each or

28
00:01:27,709 --> 00:01:31,459
whatever so we could afford a nice place

29
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:32,689
instead of getting little hotel rooms

30
00:01:31,459 --> 00:01:36,559
like everyone else is doing into

31
00:01:32,689 --> 00:01:37,759
conference so Airbnb made a mistake we

32
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,868
said what are you gonna do about it they

33
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,368
said we're gonna find you another house

34
00:01:38,868 --> 00:01:42,709
don't worry about it and if there's a

35
00:01:40,368 --> 00:01:46,280
difference in price we will cover it

36
00:01:42,709 --> 00:01:49,129
well let me tell you the difference of

37
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,719
price on this particular house was

38
00:01:49,129 --> 00:01:52,489
seriously about twelve or fourteen

39
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:54,590
thousand dollars so give you guys a

40
00:01:52,489 --> 00:01:56,919
