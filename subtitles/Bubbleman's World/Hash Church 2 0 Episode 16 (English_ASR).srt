last gotten together and it's been

20
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:57,838
incredible how much news has occurred in

21
00:00:54,448 --> 00:00:59,608
the cannabis world community since the

22
00:00:57,838 --> 00:01:01,378
last hash search and that's really what

23
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:03,088
kind of got me this morning as I woke up

24
00:01:01,378 --> 00:01:05,640
a little bit earlier than usual and had

25
00:01:03,088 --> 00:01:07,200
some extra time I thought man it'd be

26
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,180
nice to just hear from a couple of

27
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,070
people I wanted to hear from Etta he's

28
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:13,590
on a cruise ship with shitty internet so

29
00:01:11,069 --> 00:01:18,569

right at the window it's perfect really

36
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,650
like it's so cold I'd put it on the

37
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,510
counter right here and it was like

38
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:39,150

55
00:02:14,188 --> 00:02:17,818

and flew to Calgary recently and met

68
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:51,120
with this brewery that has an interest

69
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:52,378
in cannabinoids and terpenoids so that

70
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,019
was kind of fun I went there with my

71
00:02:52,378 --> 00:02:57,449
team at embark I don't even know how

72
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:59,640
many people even know about embark to be

73
00:02:57,449 --> 00:03:02,068
honest I have I talked about embark much

74
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:03,539
my latest project I don't think he works

75
00:03:02,068 --> 00:03:05,669
you really talked about it at all I mean

76
00:03:03,539 --> 00:03:07,199
people need to be like ourselves and

77
00:03:05,669 --> 00:03:09,000
your friends know what's going on and

78
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:11,098
what you're doing but really no one

79
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,109
knows what's going on with a barque what

80
00:03:11,098 --> 00:03:15,119
we've talked about over the years and

81
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:16,859
and and where you're going with what

82
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,169
you're doing I think it's fantastic I'm

83
00:03:16,859 --> 00:03:20,280
so stoked and proud of what what's going

84
00:03:19,169 --> 00:03:21,660
on with the industry and what you're

85
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,549
doing with the industry you got to tell

86
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:26,340
people what's going on yeah yeah for

87
00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:29,099
sure well I've got Mike West coming in

88
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:30,419
here later so he'll be able to to talk

89
00:03:29,098 --> 00:03:32,518
about a little bit about that as well

90
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:35,459
but yeah Embarq has been moving forward

91
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:37,769
of course this is a new company that

92
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:41,400
I've helped found just in the last six

93
00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:43,799
to seven months actually and got great

94
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,719
team of people super stoked on them

95
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:48,540
really professional and high caliber

96
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:50,219
which I've truly it's my first time

97
00:03:48,539 --> 00:03:52,078
experiencing in the in the cannabis

98
00:03:50,219 --> 00:03:54,509
industry working with a team of this

99
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:56,040
calibre and so we're pretty excited

100
00:03:54,509 --> 00:03:59,068
about it obviously it's an extraction

101
00:03:56,039 --> 00:04:00,929
lab we've got a facility here in Delta

102
00:03:59,068 --> 00:04:03,060
BC that we're going to be doing 40,000

103
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:04,680
square feet of extraction and it's it

104
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,329
when I say extraction it's not just

105
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,939
bubbleman extraction it's much bigger

106
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:10,469
than me obviously I'm very focused on

107
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:12,539
solvent list extraction I love the

108
00:04:10,469 --> 00:04:25,889
Rosslyn I love the full melt water hash

109
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:27,899
I love the back but also dry sifting you

110
00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:28,199
know that the solvent list processes but

111
00:04:27,899 --> 00:04:30,539
then I

112
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:33,509
the same time we've got we've got a

113
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:36,060
great team including Mike West who's

114
00:04:33,509 --> 00:04:38,819
really gonna be focused on the co2 the

115
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:41,250
hydrocarbon the cryo ethanol which my

116
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:42,930
partner Anthony from Colorado will be

117
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:45,029
will be actively involved in so we're

118
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:47,220
really putting this this really cool

119
00:04:45,029 --> 00:04:49,259
team together kind of before the laws

120
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:51,900
are even really allowing it so we've

121
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:55,099
done a lot of due diligence in the last

122
00:04:51,899 --> 00:04:57,179
six months we're funded for Phase one

123
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:58,620
simultaneously actually while we're

124
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,660
building out the building that already

125
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:02,639
exists so it's a rebuild kind of well

126
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:05,220
you know we're just gonna be doing you

127
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,629
know building specific things in each

128
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:08,790
room that already exists simultaneously

129
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:10,800
we've now taken on a project in

130
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:12,420
Woodstock Ontario where we're actually

131
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,270
going to build it up from the ground up

132
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:17,819
so this this could be 40,000 50,000

133
00:05:15,269 --> 00:05:19,469
60,000 upwards of 80,000 square feet of

134
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:21,060
extraction it's going to be sitting on

135
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:23,730
three acres that our partners already

136
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:26,100
own and it's going to have some serious

137
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:29,939
capabilities if embark and Delta can do

138
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:32,010
3.6 to 4 million pounds per year of

139
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:33,689
processing we're hoping on getting

140
00:05:32,009 --> 00:05:35,909
double that out of the Woodstock

141
00:05:33,689 --> 00:05:38,250
facility so it's it's something very

142
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:42,120
serious when you're talking millions of

143
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:45,629
pounds of cannabis being being extracted

144
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:47,129
into traditional hashes into oh there's

145
00:05:45,629 --> 00:05:51,750
Mike now what's going on brother

146

him dark and breaking down all the

149
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:59,039
different types of processes that we're

150
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:01,439
gonna be rocking on and the facility in

151
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:03,750
Woodstock and the facility in Delta and

152
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:05,730
was talking about you in regards to kind

153
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:08,129
of you know being in charge of our co2

154
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:10,350
and our hydro carbon division and

155
00:06:08,129 --> 00:06:12,899
helping with our cryo ethanol and post

156
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:15,570
production of isolates and boom you came

157
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:17,939
right in we're just talking about really

158

165
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:37,230
it's 20 minutes we really do appreciate

166
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:39,629
it that you came by and hung out on a

167
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:41,370
hash Church with us hey you know it you

168
00:06:39,629 --> 00:06:43,439
know hey it's a good morning

169
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:45,480
here I wanted to see some old friends

170
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:48,418
consume some cannabis before taking the

171
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:51,150
kids to go swimming and here we are

172
00:06:48,418 --> 00:06:52,859
dude you're an inspiration to me one of

173
00:06:51,149 --> 00:06:54,870
the I mean in many ways of course all of

174
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:57,270
you guys are but one way that you really

175
00:06:54,870 --> 00:07:01,199
inspire me is that you and I've kind of

176
00:06:57,269 --> 00:07:03,560
not jealous not envious inspired by the

177
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:07,710
conversation that you started about

178
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:09,720
parenting kids and cannabis I think it's

179
00:07:07,709 --> 00:07:11,489
an extremely mature topic that you've

180
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:15,060
that you've taken on and it's just a

181
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:16,860
topic that more and more people parents

182
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,780
of kids who are cannabis users whether

183
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:20,699
recreational whether preventive whether

184
00:07:18,779 --> 00:07:23,009
medicinal I think it's an important

185
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:24,719
conversation to have and I'm definitely

186
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:26,849
wanting to plant a hash Church in the

187
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,229
future when you have more time to get

188
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:29,790
into that conversation because I've

189
00:07:28,228 --> 00:07:32,370
watched you have it with a multitude of

190
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:34,020
people now and it's it's the time is now

191
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:38,038
for that conversation brother so hats

192
00:07:34,019 --> 00:07:39,839
off you thank you if I was wearing a hat

193
00:07:38,038 --> 00:07:42,870
I would take it off myself and you know

194
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:45,060
I mean I felt like it was just one of

195
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:46,860
the last places are not one of the last

196
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:49,620
places but you know it was something

197
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:52,379
that I could speak from my own true

198
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:54,060
experience with it and you know having

199
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:56,279
kids that are right now four and eight

200
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:58,110
years old and just going to elementary

201
00:07:56,279 --> 00:08:00,209
school and dealing with the PTA and

202
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:01,710
other parents you know what I realize is

203
00:08:00,209 --> 00:08:03,569
there was just so much misinformation

204
00:08:01,709 --> 00:08:05,909
out there and it was really an

205
00:08:03,569 --> 00:08:09,348
opportunity to be able to initiate

206
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:12,180
people and you know the part is not even

207
00:08:09,348 --> 00:08:13,800
though it's not report cramming it down

208
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:16,079
the throat they were just looking for

209
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,759
new information on cannabis the

210
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:19,560
different ways that we can utilize it

211
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:22,529
and what's the best way to talk about it

212
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,759
with our children it's super important

213
00:08:22,529 --> 00:08:25,500
and you just nailed it right there

214
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,449
that's where the conversation starts

215
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:30,629
because there's two ways as a father to

216
00:08:27,449 --> 00:08:31,829
go through this there's the way of this

217
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:33,389
conversation makes my wife very

218
00:08:31,829 --> 00:08:37,019
uncomfortable so I'm just going to avoid

219
00:08:33,389 --> 00:08:38,668
it completely or I'm gonna talk about

220
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:41,519
this I'm gonna let people know that I'm

221
00:08:38,668 --> 00:08:43,139
not they're worried I'm not a worry for

222
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,269
them I'm not trying to take their young

223
00:08:43,139 --> 00:08:47,429
kids behind the school and get them high

224
00:08:45,269 --> 00:08:49,799
this is like you know this is a

225
00:08:47,429 --> 00:08:51,389
different thing completely and and and I

226
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:53,759
think that it's as important for a

227
00:08:51,389 --> 00:08:54,519
recreational user as it is for a

228
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:56,620
medicinal use

229
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:59,759
of course in the last 15 to 20 years

230
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:02,980
we've given a lot more sort of you know

231
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:05,110
we've accepted medical users more than

232
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:06,909
we've accepted recreational users you

233
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:08,830
know it's like oh oh okay it's a

234
00:09:06,909 --> 00:09:10,600
medicine okay well then you know that's

235
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:12,639
different but we're getting to a point

236
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,379
now where it's like well you know

237
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:16,600
cannabis is a preventive medicine which

238
00:09:14,379 --> 00:09:19,600
really makes recreational use preventive

239
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:21,759
and so there's also a value in using it

240
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,610
recreational and and preventatively

241
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:26,309
one does not have to wait to get sick

242
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:29,919
one does not have to wait to be

243
00:09:26,309 --> 00:09:31,809
endocannabinoid deficient before kind of

244
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:33,789
taking taking you know taking

245
00:09:31,809 --> 00:09:36,039
responsibility into your own hands so I

246
00:09:33,789 --> 00:09:38,259
just think it's a great conversation and

247
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:40,480
I'm definitely super stoked to get into

248
00:09:38,259 --> 00:09:43,000
it more maybe we could have a panel of

249
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,310
all parents you know when we have that

250
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,409
conversation and just really go deep

251
00:09:45,309 --> 00:09:49,539
into and I'm sure if we had you know a

252
00:09:47,409 --> 00:09:52,719
variety of parents as well from the

253
00:09:49,539 --> 00:09:53,949
super deeply like full-blown you know

254
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,430
like Earth Mother

255
00:09:53,950 --> 00:10:00,030
regenerative farming like organics right

256
00:09:57,429 --> 00:10:03,129
up to the professional you know you know

257
00:10:00,029 --> 00:10:04,839
person that has a career person that has

258
00:10:03,129 --> 00:10:06,639
you know that's not in cannabis

259
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:08,860
whatsoever but how did how did those two

260
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:10,240
people perceive differently maybe and

261
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:13,090
just you know get into the conversation

262
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:16,180

even in real size you know we smoked the

324

schwag at home but you take the epic

325
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:55,630
buds and you give them away to your

326
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:57,970
friends Eric we want to show our best

327
00:12:55,629 --> 00:12:59,110
and we take our best with us wherever we

328
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:01,210
going the first thing we want to do is

329
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:03,009
like here check this out man beautiful

330
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:04,450
hey I want to hear from Sabol one last

331
00:13:03,009 --> 00:13:06,759
time because I know he has to balance

332
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:09,190
really soon can you tell us a little bit

333
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:11,710
about your new products your new

334
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:14,080
vaporizer the hot new labs oh yeah

335
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:16,900
absolutely absolutely thank you and did

336
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:20,879
I sent some uh hardware up your weight

337
00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:20,879
as it arrived yet Marcus

338
00:13:21,409 --> 00:13:28,039
okay sorry so rude of me to ask you a

339
00:13:26,179 --> 00:13:30,528
question while you are taking a DAB so

340
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:34,669
this is basically our new device it's

341
00:13:30,528 --> 00:13:37,458
the ha new ha nice tone vape XL is still

342
00:13:34,669 --> 00:13:38,990
in existence it's just um I guess it's

343
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:42,018
growing up it's going through puberty

344
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:43,698
and ha new labs and essentially what we

345
00:13:42,019 --> 00:13:46,250
wanted to do was we started off with a

346
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:48,309
desktop vaporizer to learn the science

347
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:50,899
and physics behind vaporization and

348
00:13:48,309 --> 00:13:53,419
sublimating the cannabinoids from a

349
00:13:50,899 --> 00:13:55,669
solid into a gas and then we wanted to

350
00:13:53,419 --> 00:13:58,729
apply it into a very easy to use

351
00:13:55,669 --> 00:14:01,278
portable and this is the device it

352
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:04,069
actually is all magnetic base and we

353
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:06,828
have a red Congo oil in here right now

354
00:14:04,068 --> 00:14:09,049
red Congo is a great landrace sativa

355
00:14:06,828 --> 00:14:11,149
strain my consumed it right before I

356
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:13,758
competed and jiu-jitsu tournament

357
00:14:11,149 --> 00:14:17,539
yesterday has been nice little shiner

358
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:19,519
and got kneed in the face and well this

359
00:14:17,539 --> 00:14:23,059
is why 42 year olds don't compete with

360
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:25,850
22 year olds but luckily I'm okay I'm

361
00:14:23,059 --> 00:14:27,588
still lying in bed my kids actually just

362
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:29,778
brought me breakfast thank you so much

363
00:14:27,589 --> 00:14:32,329
because they know daddy can't move today

364
00:14:29,778 --> 00:14:34,730
so I am very much utilizing this as a

365
00:14:32,328 --> 00:14:37,669
recovery tool but essentially this was

366
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:39,769
our version of a vape pen you know when

367
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:42,229
we were looking at the vape pens I

368
00:14:39,769 --> 00:14:44,899
started researching and I noticed less

369
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:46,759
than 7% of cannabis users actually

370
00:14:44,899 --> 00:14:48,470
smoked cigarettes and I thought well

371
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:50,480
we're always talking about health and

372
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:53,060
wellness so why do we have these things

373
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:55,370
looking like cancer sticks and things

374
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:56,989
that give you um carcinogen so we

375
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:57,889
thought just getting away from the shape

376
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:59,899
of something that looked like a

377
00:14:57,889 --> 00:15:01,370
cigarette would be great the next thing

378
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:03,860
we wanted to do is just have something

379
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:05,839
that had a really cool tactile sensation

380
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:07,519
in your hand so that if you couldn't

381
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,949
consume it you could still rub it like a

382
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:12,799
worry stone and maybe just relieve some

383
00:15:09,948 --> 00:15:15,500
anxiety without even having to consume

384
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:17,179
it and we also made it asymmetrical in

385
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:20,089
shape you know I live in San Francisco

386
00:15:17,179 --> 00:15:21,948
which is the home of Technology and even

387
00:15:20,089 --> 00:15:24,559
here I think we're sick of Technology

388
00:15:21,948 --> 00:15:26,719
people are meditating more camping more

389
00:15:24,558 --> 00:15:29,688
hiking more so we just wanted something

390
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:32,689
that would be asymmetrical that would

391
00:15:29,688 --> 00:15:34,159
remind someone of the imperfections of

392
00:15:32,688 --> 00:15:35,029
nature or maybe the perfect

393
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:37,370
imperfections

394
00:15:35,029 --> 00:15:39,889
nature and the last thing was to really

395
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:42,500
make sure that it didn't just look cool

396
00:15:39,889 --> 00:15:44,629
and feel good but that when you put it

397
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:46,759
to your mouth and you inhaled it those

398
00:15:44,629 --> 00:15:49,340
would supersede the first two user

399
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:52,069
experiences and we all know how much you

400
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:54,320
know effort the extractors put into

401
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:57,830
creating all the oils today the live

402
00:15:54,320 --> 00:16:00,590
rosin the shatters the the diamonds the

403
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:02,690
sauces so what we did was when we

404
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:05,360
created our own version of our atomizer

405
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:08,330
most of the atomizers you know are

406
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:11,029
really small and the oil will sit on top

407
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:13,220
of like the ceramic disc or the nichrome

408
00:16:11,029 --> 00:16:15,500
wire and what we ended up doing was of

409
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:17,840
creating what we call a ceramic sponge

410
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:20,539
so just like sponges have nooks and

411
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:21,950
crannies to absorb more water by having

412
00:16:20,539 --> 00:16:24,679
all these nooks and crannies in the

413
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:26,240
porous ceramic we have roughly three

414
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:27,979
times the surface area as your

415
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,289
traditional vape pen which allows us to

416
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:32,590
use lower temperatures to give you

417
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:34,849
headaches over and larger clouds so

418
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:36,680
hopefully we hit the mark but um

419
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:38,840
hopefully you get yours in a few days

420
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:41,779
and you could let me know um if we hit

421
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:43,430
the mark I already know you trust me on

422
00:16:41,779 --> 00:16:45,169
that one I know because I've been

423
00:16:43,429 --> 00:16:46,219
anxiously at first you're like oh I'm

424
00:16:45,169 --> 00:16:48,589
gonna send you one of these I was like

425
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:50,660
okay whatever that's cool and then as I

426
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:54,350
started seeing people's experiences with

427
00:16:50,659 --> 00:16:56,600
them I was kind of like wow like this is

428
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:58,040
crazy and then it got worse and worse

429
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,080
and worse to the point where now my

430
00:16:58,039 --> 00:17:02,059
mouth water is when I see it so I just

431
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:04,880
at least have to try it and you know for

432
00:17:02,059 --> 00:17:06,289
me there is a lot in what you said at

433
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,570
the towards the end by the way welcome

434
00:17:06,289 --> 00:17:09,740
to Colin over on the east coast I don't

435
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:12,169
know if he's in New York or

436
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:16,279
Massachusetts no comment he sweat up

437
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:17,900
garish what I was gonna say was and it's

438
00:17:16,279 --> 00:17:19,339
a big long conversation and we've had a

439
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:22,040
little bit of that conversation before

440
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:24,500
for me there is a real difference in the

441
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:27,470
preservation of terpene profiles through

442
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:31,660
any type of vaporizer or dab rig and

443
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:34,490
that almost always is in regards to how

444
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:38,180
the material that you're hitting off of

445
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:40,039
holds and releases heat and so that's

446
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:42,170
why Sapphire doesn't taste the same as

447
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:44,180
courts and courts doesn't taste the same

448
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:45,590
as titanium all when you do them all at

449
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:47,810
the exact same temperature which I've

450
00:17:45,589 --> 00:17:48,689
done they don't taste the same with the

451
00:17:47,809 --> 00:17:50,398
exact same it's

452
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:52,200
area and I was actually hitting a

453
00:17:50,398 --> 00:17:53,849
vaporizer the other drift the other day

454
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:58,639
and I don't think I have it here it was

455
00:17:53,849 --> 00:18:02,490
it was very much like Gary's from from

456
00:17:58,638 --> 00:18:04,500
the Omicron he's talking about the torch

457
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:07,259
yeah yeah but I was actually pleasantly

458
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:09,599
surprised at how much that preserved the

459
00:18:07,259 --> 00:18:11,940
taste because I've been dabbing off of I

460
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:14,759
think I'm hitting silicon carbide right

461
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:17,548
now and I've been dabbing off of it for

462
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:18,750
about a week to two weeks this hash and

463
00:18:17,548 --> 00:18:21,990
I ended up putting a little bit in that

464
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:24,690
torch and I was just very surprised at

465
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:27,028
how different the tastes were and I

466
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:28,860
think that that's something that you

467
00:18:27,028 --> 00:18:31,558
know vaporization companies should focus

468
00:18:28,859 --> 00:18:33,599
on much the same way when I spoke with

469
00:18:31,558 --> 00:18:35,480
the Remo years ago about his nutrient

470
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:38,788
company that he was thinking of starting

471
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:40,860
was to focus on the productions of the

472
00:18:38,788 --> 00:18:42,329
phenols and the hydrocarbons within the

473
00:18:40,859 --> 00:18:44,038
trichome had like if you want to

474
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:46,138
manipulate something with your food

475
00:18:44,038 --> 00:18:47,878
learn to manipulate the actual

476
00:18:46,138 --> 00:18:51,599
production of the building blocks of the

477
00:18:47,878 --> 00:18:54,480
cannabinoids and terpenoids that produce

478
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:57,538
and create more vegetative yields of

479
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,579
plant matter and so I see vaporizers and

480
00:18:57,538 --> 00:19:01,619
and food complex that's the focus if you

481
00:18:59,579 --> 00:19:03,869
have a food company in my opinion you

482
00:19:01,619 --> 00:19:06,538
know like figure out a way to produce

483
00:19:03,869 --> 00:19:08,298
more medicinal components you know of a

484
00:19:06,538 --> 00:19:10,740
higher quality of a higher expression

485
00:19:08,298 --> 00:19:13,648
vaporized companies vaporization

486
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:16,589
companies is to preserve the profile so

487
00:19:13,648 --> 00:19:20,219
when you when you hit it the taste is

488
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:22,589
just so good and III I'd hate to say it

489
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:25,919
because I loved a Briggs but I think the

490
00:19:22,589 --> 00:19:29,759
nicest tasting hits that I've had come

491
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:32,750
from handheld vaporizers for

492
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:32,750
preservation of taste

493
00:19:33,619 --> 00:19:39,418
to mark and really because of just the

494
00:19:36,898 --> 00:19:41,339
way it heats and I and as you talked

495
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:42,659
about that because I've been doing a lot

496
00:19:41,339 --> 00:19:44,490
of dabbing with the torch and then

497
00:19:42,659 --> 00:19:47,129
before us on the email these that penzal

498
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:49,769
on and as you're talking about that the

499
00:19:47,128 --> 00:19:56,428
Pens give it that nice smooth I like the

500
00:19:49,769 --> 00:19:58,679
taste here it's right on par yeah I'll

501
00:19:56,429 --> 00:20:02,470
agree I was using the the torch

502
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:04,300
yesterday and the Omni Kron as well and

503
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:06,460
you know just give you a different

504
00:20:04,299 --> 00:20:08,049
prefer a ver profile all together but

505
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:10,240
the the thing that I've been talking to

506
00:20:08,049 --> 00:20:13,450
a lot of manufacturers about is the the

507
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:17,970
reheating and the the heating of of you

508
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:20,769
know oils in and a half gram to a gram

509
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:22,750
it's you know that heating and reheating

510
00:20:20,769 --> 00:20:26,829
really causes you know a lot of strain

511
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:28,509
on the material and overtime so when we

512
00:20:26,829 --> 00:20:30,759
get you know you get a nice little dab

513
00:20:28,509 --> 00:20:34,319
in there on the torch or the omicron

514
00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:37,420
it's just unbelievably great you know so

515
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:39,339
if we can get closer to that with having

516
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:41,680
oil let's say we take solve unless we

517
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:43,569
put it into a car it's that heating and

518
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:45,850
reheating and that material that same

519
00:20:43,569 --> 00:20:47,649
material staying in that element that

520
00:20:45,849 --> 00:20:50,799
really causes it to degrade and really

521
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:52,210
lose its its its flavor profile you just

522
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:55,450
don't have you don't get that with the

523
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:58,990
Omni Kron good that that leads me to my

524
00:20:55,450 --> 00:21:01,480
vape exhale which is the only unit I

525
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:03,700
have ever been able to take keer terpene

526
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:05,829
rips out of without it just being

527
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:08,529
horribly destructive on my throat

528
00:21:05,829 --> 00:21:10,539
there's no other unit that I've ever

529
00:21:08,529 --> 00:21:13,089
been able to hit pure Terps off of like

530
00:21:10,539 --> 00:21:15,069
that one I mean I did a whole [ __ ]

531
00:21:13,089 --> 00:21:17,980
terpene gauntlet I can't remember who I

532
00:21:15,069 --> 00:21:20,259
did it with maybe Brett from you were

533
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:22,059
there to say well we big one

534
00:21:20,259 --> 00:21:24,250
we did one as well I think we did like

535
00:21:22,059 --> 00:21:26,559
nineteen continent okay because I

536
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:29,289
definitely have a fourteen as well and

537
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:32,019
it might have even been d4 20k I can't

538
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:34,869
remember but that's that's saying a lot

539
00:21:32,019 --> 00:21:39,819
and that is I always mix the two up

540
00:21:34,869 --> 00:21:44,079
convection conduction induction

541
00:21:39,819 --> 00:21:46,119
induction yeah and you know I've I've

542
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:48,639
always been a fan of convection over

543
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:50,889
conduction but as time has gone on you

544
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,050
know I've seen that there it's how you

545
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:55,750
execute the methodology that matters

546
00:21:53,049 --> 00:21:57,700
most in no I played around with so many

547
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:59,829
different temperature types so many

548
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:01,269
different surface areas you know one

549
00:21:59,829 --> 00:22:04,210
thing that I was really playing around

550
00:22:01,269 --> 00:22:07,569
with was being able to inductively hate

551
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:09,279
fretted laughs in a way where a dab

552
00:22:07,569 --> 00:22:10,839
could just kind of melt into it and

553
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:12,970
really take advantage of the additional

554
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:15,189
surface area and the interesting thing

555
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:17,680
is you know it's it's

556
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:20,110
each type of material or each type of

557
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:22,299
technology has its own kind of flavor

558
00:22:20,109 --> 00:22:25,119
signature as you were mentioning earlier

559
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:26,829
and as we all know flavor is subjective

560
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:28,389
so I just tell people you should

561
00:22:26,829 --> 00:22:30,909
experiment with all the different kinds

562
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:32,590
that you could find and ultimately you

563
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:35,620
know you will arrive at your favorite

564
00:22:32,589 --> 00:22:37,869
and the best part is um it's always fun

565
00:22:35,619 --> 00:22:39,969
as you're doing R&amp;D so even if it's not

566
00:22:37,869 --> 00:22:44,289
right you're still getting a good effect

567
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:46,539
the result and the terpenes all have

568
00:22:44,289 --> 00:22:48,549
different each terpene each monoterpene

569
00:22:46,539 --> 00:22:52,359
has a different you know combustion

570
00:22:48,549 --> 00:22:55,389
point so that's part of it I think as

571
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:56,709
well I mean these in research and

572
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:58,240
talking with some people I don't know

573
00:22:56,710 --> 00:23:00,220
somebody here from Colorado and stuff

574
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,599
we're talking about terpenes and inside

575
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:03,460
the containers because of the way that

576
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:05,349
pre-packaging here in Canada with

577
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:06,880
containers and stuff like that and and

578
00:23:05,349 --> 00:23:08,619
looking at active water content and

579
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,060
terpenes and how they're in the

580
00:23:08,619 --> 00:23:13,089
containers are looking at their moisture

581
00:23:10,059 --> 00:23:15,099
content sure that's nothing we focus on

582
00:23:13,089 --> 00:23:16,599
heavily is trying to retain all that

583
00:23:15,099 --> 00:23:19,629
moisture content because once that's

584
00:23:16,599 --> 00:23:21,969
lost your terpenes go with it man yeah I

585
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:24,400
mean I would like to do a half stretch

586
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:26,410
on this mark about moisture content

587
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,720
after water content and low humidity

588
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:30,040
because it's quite a thing fascinating

589
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,870
that I've been researching to the last

590
00:23:30,039 --> 00:23:33,759
little bit and there's a lots of

591
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:35,439
possible and it's just I don't have time

592
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:36,940
today cuz I gotta catch a plane and I

593
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,320
like to kind of get deep into it about

594
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:40,690
it but there's there's all these little

595
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:42,329
factors with legalization we're looking

596
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:44,710
at and how they're actually distributing

597
00:23:42,329 --> 00:23:47,049
all of this right now you know what I

598
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:49,900
mean like it's yeah I've been watching

599
00:23:47,049 --> 00:23:52,690
your voice yeah i'm testing stuff that

600
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:55,330
like 29% active water now active water

601
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:57,460
content in bread crumbs is 30 past it is

602
00:23:55,329 --> 00:23:58,869
50 so there's got to be a standard

603
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:00,279
there's there's more I want to talk

604
00:23:58,869 --> 00:24:02,859
about so I'm just gonna kind of like

605
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:04,480
this right also well that goes back to

606
00:24:02,859 --> 00:24:06,789
the man you like now we're talking about

607
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,950
like GM piece like manufacturing right

608
00:24:06,789 --> 00:24:15,369
and we're like as artists and as

609
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:16,930
cultivators you you kind of you know we

610
00:24:15,369 --> 00:24:18,579
have all these new steps we have to pay

611
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:19,990
attention to cuz it's not just going

612
00:24:18,579 --> 00:24:22,960
into packs and then being quickly sold

613
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:25,900
it's now being you know the packages are

614
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:29,069
now going to be individuals into grams a

615
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:31,290
halves and there's a large

616
00:24:29,069 --> 00:24:34,919
one month three months six months when

617
00:24:31,289 --> 00:24:36,450
it was packaged all this act Li is this

618
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,620
is totally different ballgame so we've

619
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:40,620
got to really think about it like that

620
00:24:37,619 --> 00:24:45,750
yeah yeah did we ever complexify this

621
00:24:40,619 --> 00:24:51,989
[ __ ] I got a bag of weed you need a bag

622
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:53,339
of weed here it's something that is dear

623
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:55,890
to my heart because I want to make sure

624
00:24:53,339 --> 00:24:57,720
that as you know what we see behind the

625
00:24:55,890 --> 00:25:00,840
scenes is not what most people see when

626
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:02,700
they go to the dispensary they see a

627
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:04,439
very different experience and I you know

628
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:06,840
it's getting closer to that experience

629
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:09,000
that we are so fond of and making sure

630
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:10,679
that that quality is upheld all the way

631
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,839
through to the first time they open it

632
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:15,330
you know that's major

633
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:17,490
you know it's hardly why for instance

634
00:25:15,329 --> 00:25:20,069
here look this is induction sealed here

635
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:23,819
and this is something I've been playing

636
00:25:20,069 --> 00:25:26,129
with for months for rosin and that's

637
00:25:23,819 --> 00:25:28,289
really important to me is because when

638
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:29,910
these things get packed you know a lot

639
00:25:28,289 --> 00:25:31,950
of people are disappointed in rosin

640
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:36,900
because it's it gets them all caked out

641
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:39,000
and dry and not what they want hey I

642
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:41,130
don't mean to interrupt but I gotta go

643
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,440
take my kids I just wanted to say one

644
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:45,600
last thing I'm big fans of everyone here

645
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,700
med caner is my favorite way to bring

646
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:48,719
all my flour around and thank you for

647
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:51,029
doing what you're doing with that

648
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:53,670
sealing because that last thing you said

649
00:25:51,029 --> 00:25:56,220
I've heard so many people say that about

650
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:58,019
their rosin and I'm so glad you came up

651
00:25:56,220 --> 00:26:01,339
with that I just wanted to make sure I

652
00:25:58,019 --> 00:26:01,339
got that out before I left

653
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,170
thanks a bow

654
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,440
so what you just talked about seals is

655
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:11,850
something I thought was the biggest

656
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,980
thing is the type of seals and all these

657
00:26:11,849 --> 00:26:16,740
containers and how the sealing worth all

658
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:18,360
across the board and I bought every LP

659
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:19,950
that I can actually purse spend a couple

660
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:21,959
thousand just to look at containers and

661
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:23,160
packaging not even smoking it I really

662
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:25,319
need that you know what they're doing

663
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:26,550
and it's and this is a big big part that

664
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:28,109
we're talking about it's actually is

665
00:26:26,549 --> 00:26:30,029
these lives in these seals and and how

666
00:26:28,109 --> 00:26:32,639
they're actually shipping this stuff and

667
00:26:30,029 --> 00:26:33,779
how dry it is and you know it's yeah I

668
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:41,280
mean I'll they'll piece out there

669
00:26:33,779 --> 00:26:43,500
listening you're welcome what are you

670
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:45,539
guys doing I'm like you guys after water

671
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:47,250
is like pathetic man like come on look

672
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:48,659
what do you guys doing in and then I'm

673
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:50,789
just not getting it and Health Canada

674
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:52,410
has to get involved too and they are

675
00:26:50,789 --> 00:26:53,819
down in the United States there's some

676
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:55,110
more stuff woman to talk about what

677
00:26:53,819 --> 00:26:56,849
they're doing the United States and in

678
00:26:55,109 --> 00:26:57,990
Canada Health Canada was in meetings a

679
00:26:56,849 --> 00:27:00,929
couple months ago they're starting to

680
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:02,190
set a standard between 55 to 65 active

681
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:03,779
water what I'm hearing we're finally

682
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:05,340
getting its standardization at some

683
00:27:03,779 --> 00:27:07,259
point right across the board because we

684
00:27:05,339 --> 00:27:11,669
would start controlling that you can

685
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:13,230
start controlling terpenes everything if

686
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:14,910
there's anything you know you want to

687
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:18,900
bounce ideas off of you know reach out

688
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:20,790
to market so you know so you know what

689
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:23,009
it's just like this this next step for

690
00:27:20,789 --> 00:27:25,079
perfect yeah yeah whoa boys you've got

691
00:27:23,009 --> 00:27:27,000
this huge you know all of our material

692
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:28,470
really relies on that and you know like

693
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,910
you're kind of pointing it out we you

694
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:31,769
know we're industrialized in an

695
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:36,410
ornamental crop and it really is

696
00:27:31,769 --> 00:27:39,019
something they look at active water and

697
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:41,100
you know what I mean so it's really that

698
00:27:39,019 --> 00:27:43,769
a:8w got we gotta really start paying

699
00:27:41,099 --> 00:27:45,240
attention to did you want to explain the

700
00:27:43,769 --> 00:27:47,970
differences to everyone or did you

701
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:49,769
already I'm not having that I was gonna

702
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:52,559
talk more about that but relative

703
00:27:49,769 --> 00:27:54,210
humidity in the air octaves one is

704
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:56,159
what's inside of the containers so if

705
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:57,960
there's a certain amount of water or

706
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:00,240
moisture content inside of a pod what

707
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:02,880
you seal it the active water is how it

708
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,440
rehydrates and goes back and forth and

709
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,940
there's certain steps of where it's

710
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,559
gotta be it can't be above like thirty

711
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:09,480
percent moisture content that's gonna be

712
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:11,339
above sixty five percent relative

713
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:13,500
humidity which would cause mold which

714
00:28:11,339 --> 00:28:15,119
active water content comes into play and

715
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:16,559
I've done a lot of testing and that's

716
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:18,539
what I want to talk more about it like

717
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:19,889
you know I'm learning I'm learning with

718
00:28:18,539 --> 00:28:22,259
other people are teaching me this

719
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:23,820
because I really want to know and they

720
00:28:22,259 --> 00:28:25,589
know that I have a voice that we're

721
00:28:23,819 --> 00:28:27,720
using in order to educate everybody on

722
00:28:25,589 --> 00:28:29,250
this so I love the bounce more ideas

723
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:32,400
also some people and really bring this

724
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:34,259
to light and talk more about it yeah so

725
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:38,250
let me ask you to do in terms of them

726
00:28:34,259 --> 00:28:41,849
testing you know has there been any any

727
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:43,740
long-term test put together that kind of

728
00:28:41,849 --> 00:28:46,169
outlined the relative humidity and

729
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:49,548
microbes that are that or really

730
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:51,470
deactive has done a lot of heavy

731
00:28:49,548 --> 00:28:57,288
HM this those are the people I'm working

732
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:58,579
with and a lot of deep research that

733
00:28:57,288 --> 00:29:00,169
they're doing with their company I'm

734
00:28:58,579 --> 00:29:01,398
doing my own little stuff you know just

735
00:29:00,169 --> 00:29:03,559
find the researcher find out what's

736
00:29:01,398 --> 00:29:04,518
going on with it talking more about it

737
00:29:03,558 --> 00:29:06,440
and that's why I want to bring it to

738
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:08,480
light because I need to learn more I

739
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:10,700
know my little port here you know what I

740
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,440
mean and yep let's just kind of let's

741
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:13,879
educate it going yeah try to keep

742
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:15,499
learning from each other yeah I mean

743
00:29:13,878 --> 00:29:17,058
there's right and that's that's part of

744
00:29:15,499 --> 00:29:21,980
why we've been exploring induction

745
00:29:17,058 --> 00:29:24,349
sailing and a new pack and I mean it is

746
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:26,269
like not touching it you know like it

747
00:29:24,349 --> 00:29:28,878
all goes down to how you harvest and how

748
00:29:26,269 --> 00:29:30,440
you dry and how that cures and hey if

749
00:29:28,878 --> 00:29:33,158
you're touching it so many times you

750
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:35,808
know I I'm so methought you're so

751
00:29:33,159 --> 00:29:38,359
detailed about what we're doing that it

752
00:29:35,808 --> 00:29:41,928
gets so obsessive you know because this

753
00:29:38,358 --> 00:29:44,418
care so much room with an active water

754
00:29:41,929 --> 00:29:46,009
meter testing as you know comes down all

755
00:29:44,419 --> 00:29:48,288
the way through and then I I was really

756
00:29:46,009 --> 00:29:49,999
interested pretty cool about it and I

757
00:29:48,288 --> 00:29:51,739
screwed up and I left my lights on my D

758
00:29:49,999 --> 00:29:55,308
go I went back in and I had tried out

759
00:29:51,739 --> 00:29:57,440
all my tops down to like 50 percent RH

760
00:29:55,308 --> 00:29:59,928
in the room so I tested the act of water

761
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:02,480
40 41 now tell you about

762
00:29:59,929 --> 00:30:04,009
I always Krampus 64 percent RH in my

763
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,169
room well it's a via nothing else level

764
00:30:04,009 --> 00:30:08,868
strange straight across the board was 52

765
00:30:06,169 --> 00:30:10,940
so then I brought my humidity up to 70

766
00:30:08,868 --> 00:30:13,608
relative humidity and all of my weed was

767
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:15,259
58 to 61 hear what I'm saying yep and

768
00:30:13,608 --> 00:30:18,589
then what are you actually putting in it

769
00:30:15,259 --> 00:30:20,868
so I've been looking at you know the

770
00:30:18,589 --> 00:30:24,349
storage aspect of it that's been a big

771
00:30:20,868 --> 00:30:27,048
part of it as well and what you watch

772
00:30:24,349 --> 00:30:29,719
parts oh no I'm not dealing you know I'm

773
00:30:27,048 --> 00:30:31,548
dealing with like 240 pounds a week you

774
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:33,649
know every 12 days you know there's like

775
00:30:31,548 --> 00:30:37,759
a new problem you know so it's like you

776
00:30:33,648 --> 00:30:39,678
know we we look at those you know we

777
00:30:37,759 --> 00:30:41,778
look at it in terms of like how you know

778
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:45,710
we've got to keep this is you gotta keep

779
00:30:41,778 --> 00:30:47,148
this at under 64% yes octave water

780
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:49,460
rotating mini and this is all with a

781
00:30:47,148 --> 00:30:50,928
talk about for like I said yeah I got to

782
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:53,659
catch a plane and I really want to get

783
00:30:50,929 --> 00:30:55,519
in but hey that was awesome I mean it

784
00:30:53,659 --> 00:30:58,129
yeah I mean these little it's funny like

785
00:30:55,519 --> 00:31:00,710
small Bop problems become very complex

786
00:30:58,128 --> 00:31:02,240
really quickly especially with what the

787
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:02,630
amount we're dealing with in volume with

788
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,190
these

789
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:08,030
he's eating was storing how the storing

790
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:10,038
it's going all these and you know wasn't

791
00:31:08,029 --> 00:31:12,048
because I'm seeing these big news these

792
00:31:10,038 --> 00:31:14,480
big production says and I'm look I'm

793
00:31:12,048 --> 00:31:16,339
drooling like wow look at this but how

794
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,048
they able to start liquid Mars doing

795
00:31:16,339 --> 00:31:20,359
with embarq see these are the next big

796
00:31:18,048 --> 00:31:22,279
steps all these extractions how to store

797
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:23,058
these cannolis for future reference and

798
00:31:22,279 --> 00:31:24,859
exactly

799
00:31:23,058 --> 00:31:26,480
that's what's so awesome we guys are

800
00:31:24,859 --> 00:31:28,759
doing and looking at all these different

801
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,288
extractions because flour is not one

802
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:31,579
thing but now we're stepping into the

803
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:33,470
next field which is going to be

804
00:31:31,579 --> 00:31:35,058
extractive it's gonna be those edibles

805
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:36,620
how they storing those edibles how are

806
00:31:35,058 --> 00:31:37,700
they you know this is all stuff they're

807
00:31:36,619 --> 00:31:39,439
gonna have to really take a look at

808
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:41,720
before they legalize this here coming up

809
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,820
on October 20th and and you know John

810
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:46,900
it's why I've always said that embarks

811
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:50,509
part of embarks real value will be the

812
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:52,750
data that it collects I understand you

813
00:31:50,509 --> 00:31:55,730
know that's going to be incredibly like

814
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:57,919
just priceless data you know like what

815
00:31:55,730 --> 00:32:00,019
would we pay for it right now if it came

816
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:03,520
up for sale if it existed and we could

817
00:32:00,019 --> 00:32:06,048
just buy it what would you pay for it

818
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:08,480
that's part of what we're doing in the

819

839
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,720
we're all in that and not playing so

840
00:32:51,859 --> 00:32:54,798
that's what we want that's what we focus

841
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,419
on and that's what we want to see

842
00:32:54,798 --> 00:32:58,548

you know grown ones fantastic and great

844
00:32:58,548 --> 00:33:02,808
but you know it consumes a lot of my own

845
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:04,909
time and I like to see better quality

846
00:33:02,808 --> 00:33:06,319
hit the market so when I am in need I

847
00:33:04,909 --> 00:33:08,419

gonna be able to consume that's gonna

850
00:33:09,349 --> 00:33:13,908
help me with my pain exactly because

851
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:16,548
let's be honest life's too short to be

852
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:19,009
selling some swag cameras

853
00:33:16,548 --> 00:33:20,808
kids I'm setting the lineup with these

854
00:33:19,009 --> 00:33:22,909
guys opening up clubs and I'm having no

855
00:33:20,808 --> 00:33:24,618
you know no packs of stuff I'm trying to

856
00:33:22,909 --> 00:33:27,080
get people who ever try to you never

857
00:33:24,618 --> 00:33:29,148
tried cannabis before did you yeah

858
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:33,699
a true experience and not by something

859
00:33:29,148 --> 00:33:36,348
that is dry or not done properly is like

860
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:38,179
no it's a parable representation of what

861
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:40,628
cannabis can be and I don't really think

862
00:33:38,179 --> 00:33:43,339
it's the faults necessarily of Elpida

863
00:33:40,628 --> 00:33:45,288
it's like the government and the rules

864
00:33:43,338 --> 00:33:48,708
that they've placed on these companies

865
00:33:45,288 --> 00:33:50,148
are like I'd like to see anyone try like

866
00:33:48,709 --> 00:33:51,798
me everyone fights for like we should

867
00:33:50,148 --> 00:33:53,208
all be allowed to try it's like all

868
00:33:51,798 --> 00:33:56,959
right like you know that's a lot of

869
00:33:53,209 --> 00:33:58,609
bankrupt people you know that's what I

870
00:33:56,959 --> 00:33:59,929
see in the States right now is like

871
00:33:58,608 --> 00:34:02,088
everybody you just want you know

872
00:33:59,929 --> 00:34:04,309
especially that this house the CBD you

873
00:34:02,088 --> 00:34:06,168
know craze right now it's it's actually

874
00:34:04,308 --> 00:34:08,148
pretty dangerous for the longevity of

875
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:16,159
the of the industry when you got stuff

876
00:34:08,148 --> 00:34:20,179
like that happening say it down D for

877
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:22,849
20k dude what's going on man we've been

878

879
00:34:22,849 --> 00:34:31,309

00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:59,630
be pressing pretty greasy it's nice

885
00:34:55,250 --> 00:35:03,500
come hard well that was it I can still

886
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:05,240
hear that in my headphones you know what

887
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:08,000
last minute Hastert's today but I'm very

888
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:09,889
stoked to just have gotten some

889
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,500
conversation and got some peeps to come

890

892
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:18,980
what he's doing you know you never even

893
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,409
mentioned which i think is great Colin

894
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:24,469
it's hilarious you keep calling your

895
00:35:21,409 --> 00:35:26,778
company in your group we but you haven't

896
00:35:24,469 --> 00:35:28,989
even mentioned the name of the actual

897
00:35:26,778 --> 00:35:32,750
comfort

898
00:35:28,989 --> 00:35:34,459
yeah so so we're yeah so I guess that's

899
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:36,260
a good thing I should i should really

900
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:38,360
well I think it's it's for a lot of

901
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:40,460
reason we're we're just you know getting

902
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:41,630
all of our our materials together and

903
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:43,699
we're you know we're finishing our

904
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:44,990
facility and I just think the timing of

905
00:35:43,699 --> 00:35:46,460
it all and we've been working really

906
00:35:44,989 --> 00:35:48,919
hard behind the scenes as you know

907
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:51,199
Marcus putting together and taking great

908
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:54,320
care and crafting what we're we're you

909
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:56,929
know putting together and Happy Valley

910
00:35:54,320 --> 00:36:02,150
is the name of the company and Marcus's

911
00:35:56,929 --> 00:36:04,549
is a part of that and we have a lot of

912
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:08,570
exciting great things happening in terms

913
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:10,250
of solving that stack we've got 27

914
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:14,420
thousand square feet of canopy coming

915
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:17,389
online with another 60 60 to follow in

916
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:19,820
the couple years behind that hopefully

917
00:36:17,389 --> 00:36:22,369
sooner than that but it's all focused

918
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:25,610
around solving lists and putting our

919
00:36:22,369 --> 00:36:28,460
ethos forward and making sure that we we

920
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:30,050
do our best that that good medicine is

921
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:31,699
put into the right people's hands and

922
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:34,580
that's really at the end of the day

923
00:36:31,699 --> 00:36:36,019
we're trying to do so everything you

924
00:36:34,579 --> 00:36:38,059
were talking about Johnny man it's like

925
00:36:36,019 --> 00:36:40,130
yeah that's like where my head's at for

926
00:36:38,059 --> 00:36:43,849
the past years just trying to figure out

927
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:45,490
how each cultivar that we know can be

928
00:36:43,849 --> 00:36:48,679
done in a certain amount of square foot

929
00:36:45,489 --> 00:36:51,589
facility can now be scaled and and that

930
00:36:48,679 --> 00:36:53,989
same quality can be upheld all the way

931
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:57,170
through and I think we've you know we've

932
00:36:53,989 --> 00:36:59,779
we get in there you know and then you

933
00:36:57,170 --> 00:37:01,490
know people like you and sharing in

934
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:02,780
these conversations will help us get kid

935
00:37:01,489 --> 00:37:06,019
even closer to what we're all looking

936
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:07,760
for so you know what's the best thing

937
00:37:06,019 --> 00:37:10,759
about what we do is we just keep doing

938
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:17,000
what we love to do yep no doubt that's

939
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:18,530
it this is true this is true but yeah so

940
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,860
we're excited man we're gonna relaunch

941
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:24,530
in in mass and uh most likely in the

942
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:26,840
fall this year and you know it's just

943
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:29,420
this is like accumulation of so many

944
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:32,120
years of designing facilities and then

945
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:33,740
getting to this this place with you know

946

00:38:19,809 --> 00:38:23,980
four years since we started this this

964
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:26,858
sort of conversation I guess you would

965
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:28,539
say and you know I felt like when it was

966
00:38:26,858 --> 00:38:31,058
going really strong that there were

967
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:33,069
these new contenders that were up and up

968
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:34,900
and coming but when it dropped and we

969
00:38:33,068 --> 00:38:37,420
stopped doing it I really didn't feel

970
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:39,160
like anything replaced you know the

971
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:40,630
weekly conversations that would occur

972
00:38:39,159 --> 00:38:42,399
and I don't pretend to think that every

973
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:44,260
minute of these conversations were worth

974
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,568
recording or whatnot but definitely

975
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:49,059
there were always gems within the hours

976
00:38:46,568 --> 00:38:53,739
that we shared each Sunday that seemed

977
00:38:49,059 --> 00:38:56,440
to like manifest and put form to you

978
00:38:53,739 --> 00:38:58,508
know part of the industry as we know it

979
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:00,250
today and I'm not trying to say that in

980
00:38:58,509 --> 00:39:01,990
an in a in a bragging type of way

981
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:04,119
because I was a very small part of it

982
00:39:01,989 --> 00:39:06,399
there was a hundred plus people that

983
00:39:04,119 --> 00:39:09,130
came on and shared their conversation

984
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:11,380
here on hash church over those years but

985
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:13,750
it is incredible from like the talking

986
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:16,329
about rosin presses into an entire

987
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:18,460
industry the talking about all of these

988
00:39:16,329 --> 00:39:21,309
different things I mean even for me for

989
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:23,829
embark you know hash Church was you know

990
00:39:21,309 --> 00:39:26,619
where I met Mike West who is gonna be a

991
00:39:23,829 --> 00:39:29,019
big part of embarked and who has already

992
00:39:26,619 --> 00:39:31,240
been a big part of embark and I I met

993
00:39:29,018 --> 00:39:34,000
him on hashed Church literally he would

994
00:39:31,239 --> 00:39:36,219
come into hash Church in his lab running

995
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,440
his co2 machine in the background while

996
00:39:36,219 --> 00:39:40,239
we were all having discussions and then

997
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:42,720
every hour or so we'd walk over to the

998
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:44,889
mic and drop some crazy large like boom

999
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:47,230
but like I gotta go back to the machine

1000
00:39:44,889 --> 00:39:48,909
for a second so that's that's how I met

1001
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:50,769
you Mike was through hashed Church so

1002
00:39:48,909 --> 00:39:54,039
it's kind of interesting to see I mean

1003
00:39:50,768 --> 00:39:56,709
obviously I knew Johnny B and D 420k

1004
00:39:54,039 --> 00:39:58,119
long before hashed Church I've known

1005
00:39:56,710 --> 00:40:00,070
those guys for I don't even know how

1006
00:39:58,119 --> 00:40:03,489
long probably is about as long as I've

1007
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:05,830
known Colin for that matter what's

1008
00:40:03,489 --> 00:40:07,539
hanging out just like three or four of

1009
00:40:05,829 --> 00:40:09,909
us all the time chanting because you're

1010
00:40:07,539 --> 00:40:11,619
running around but even way before that

1011
00:40:09,909 --> 00:40:14,369
I mean holy [ __ ] I've known you guys for

1012
00:40:11,619 --> 00:40:17,199
a couple of decades it's a long time

1013
00:40:14,369 --> 00:40:20,559
it's good to have you guys no doubt my

1014
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:22,919
Marcus what's that Michael just being

1015
00:40:20,559 --> 00:40:25,750
able to you know walk hang out and watch

1016
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:32,769
church wall you're sitting in the lab

1017
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:36,429
for hours yeah there's more nearly as

1018
00:40:32,769 --> 00:40:38,380
fun as listening to knowledge yeah yeah

1019
00:40:36,429 --> 00:40:39,549
for sure no that's that's I never really

1020
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:41,920
thought of that but I always had people

1021
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:44,380
contact me and tell me oh we put hash

1022
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:46,659
Church on in our in our you know glass

1023
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:48,700
shop or we put hash search on and are in

1024
00:40:46,659 --> 00:40:50,949
our dispensary I was like right on

1025
00:40:48,699 --> 00:40:53,169
that's that's great I seen it a few

1026
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:55,779
times I think I even was filming one

1027
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:59,099
time and I went into a dispensary I

1028
00:40:55,780 --> 00:41:03,160
think it was my friends in my Orca and

1029
00:40:59,099 --> 00:41:04,599
hashed Church was on their TVs and I was

1030
00:41:03,159 --> 00:41:06,309
caught I asked him I was like did you do

1031
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:08,259
that on purpose and he was like no not

1032
00:41:06,309 --> 00:41:11,340
at all it was just the timing of walking

1033
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:14,710
in so that was pretty cool

1034
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:17,380
Rob's mark how about what signing

1035
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:19,000
autographs signing autographs how do you

1036
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:20,610

1037
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:25,119

1039

1040
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:34,870
autographs I'm like a lowly hash maker

1041
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:36,610
but my the stuff that I did nobody came

1042

up and talked to me about it talk to us

1043
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:39,820

1045
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:44,440

1046
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:46,690
brother and sister for the first time we

1047
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:48,550
were filled with not right I know that

1048
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:53,019
was incredible to you about results that

1049
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:55,510
was an emotional moment I was part of it

1050
00:41:53,019 --> 00:41:57,460
yeah I was awesome man it was

1051
00:41:55,510 --> 00:42:00,160
it was really cool yeah no that was

1052
00:41:57,460 --> 00:42:09,940
definitely coming and ripping with us on

1053
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:12,519
Christmas right so many nice memories of

1054
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:13,990
really cool moments throughout the whole

1055
00:42:12,519 --> 00:42:16,239
thing like when we started this it was

1056
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:18,459
just literally going in and getting high

1057
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:20,409
together showing what we're making on

1058
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:22,389
the dry set and stuff and I could check

1059
00:42:20,409 --> 00:42:24,609
this out our little parchment so

1060
00:42:22,389 --> 00:42:26,289
everything is like it was so brand-new

1061
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:27,789
in the industry nobody was even selling

1062
00:42:26,289 --> 00:42:30,039
dry sift or anything like that because

1063
00:42:27,789 --> 00:42:32,829
it was so hard to make and so hard to

1064
00:42:30,039 --> 00:42:37,320
acquire that when you got caught you

1065
00:42:32,829 --> 00:42:39,819
kept course I [ __ ] gold gold dust

1066
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:41,830
peace out Johnny B thanks for dropping

1067
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:42,640
knowledge today people were impressed in

1068
00:42:41,829 --> 00:42:45,699
the chat room

1069
00:42:42,639 --> 00:42:46,480
they said Johnny B's on fire let's talk

1070
00:42:45,699 --> 00:42:48,609
next week

1071
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:50,980
love you guys Darren you rock man that's

1072
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:52,510
rice if you don't forget the back of

1073
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:55,090
that card talk more about that that's

1074
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:57,250
how look at how have started even rosin

1075
00:42:55,090 --> 00:42:59,410
with Tony pressing old hash and that's

1076
00:42:57,250 --> 00:43:01,150
all grown with the curling iron and like

1077
00:42:59,409 --> 00:43:03,489
all of these texts yeah they all started

1078
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:08,829
from us screwing around on how scourge

1079
00:43:03,489 --> 00:43:11,409
guys you rock piece these brothers you

1080
00:43:08,829 --> 00:43:17,380
know right I wondered how many things of

1081
00:43:11,409 --> 00:43:18,940
how many industries started like

1082
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:24,869
businesses and everything like that

1083
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:27,670
because that's everything that's been

1084
00:43:24,869 --> 00:43:30,849
okay the interesting thing about that is

1085
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:34,690
that when you share the information in

1086
00:43:30,849 --> 00:43:38,199
conversation things blow up you know

1087
00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:40,150
when you hold your IP to yourself as

1088
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:42,849
strong as you can and this is the sort

1089
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:45,130
of this is that hard part of coming from

1090
00:43:42,849 --> 00:43:46,929
the industry and getting into these

1091
00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:49,180
larger companies where you're like okay

1092
00:43:46,929 --> 00:43:51,069
like there's more on like it was easy to

1093
00:43:49,179 --> 00:43:53,049
think that way over here cuz it was just

1094
00:43:51,070 --> 00:43:56,650
a couple of thousand invested but when

1095
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:58,600
you have tens of millions invested it's

1096
00:43:56,650 --> 00:44:00,519
crazy how you have to be more careful

1097
00:43:58,599 --> 00:44:02,049
and it's too bad because you're right

1098
00:44:00,519 --> 00:44:03,789
like a lot of the conversations that

1099
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:06,250
happened on here people were able to

1100
00:44:03,789 --> 00:44:08,139
take that information that what they

1101
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:08,900
heard on here and basically you know

1102
00:44:08,139 --> 00:44:11,298
deuce

1103
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:15,170
things serious with it executed whether

1104
00:44:11,298 --> 00:44:18,259
for a small personal gain to make a pure

1105
00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:20,180
medicine for themselves or to you know

1106
00:44:18,259 --> 00:44:22,998
create and produce medicine for others

1107
00:44:20,179 --> 00:44:25,219
or maybe they started a company and

1108
00:44:22,998 --> 00:44:27,858
touch tens of thousands you know selling

1109
00:44:25,219 --> 00:44:29,538
a product like a rosin press or

1110
00:44:27,858 --> 00:44:32,449
something yeah

1111
00:44:29,539 --> 00:44:35,410
well I'm doing a consulting business up

1112
00:44:32,449 --> 00:44:37,548
here in Prince George it's not quite

1113
00:44:35,409 --> 00:44:40,068
launched yet but it's gonna be right

1114
00:44:37,548 --> 00:44:41,659
away where it's just everybody can grow

1115
00:44:40,068 --> 00:44:43,608
therefore plants and all that stuff but

1116
00:44:41,659 --> 00:44:45,348
there's a way they got to do it they got

1117
00:44:43,608 --> 00:44:47,960
it register they got to do all this sort

1118
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:49,579
of stuff to make it to make it good for

1119
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:52,849
themselves but I just want to show them

1120
00:44:49,579 --> 00:44:54,920
how I do it myself and how I process it

1121
00:44:52,849 --> 00:44:57,440
myself whether I'm dry sifting bubbling

1122
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:59,659
or rasa ting the flower or the bubble

1123
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:02,179
house whatever and let them have their

1124
00:44:59,659 --> 00:45:04,278
grow their medicine and and make it as

1125
00:45:02,179 --> 00:45:05,719
pure as they want and I'll go on and

1126
00:45:04,278 --> 00:45:07,369
consult for them and do it for a very

1127
00:45:05,719 --> 00:45:10,009
reasonable price because it's only four

1128
00:45:07,369 --> 00:45:12,230
plants at a time these are all all just

1129
00:45:10,009 --> 00:45:14,150
normal humans now not wanting to get

1130
00:45:12,230 --> 00:45:18,108
[ __ ] taken to the cleaners to learn

1131
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:21,499
how to do something right and it's just

1132
00:45:18,108 --> 00:45:23,298
my way it's not like late like I you

1133
00:45:21,498 --> 00:45:25,848
know I don't know everything but I do

1134
00:45:23,298 --> 00:45:27,650
have access to pretty much everything I

1135
00:45:25,849 --> 00:45:31,068
need to know if I want to if I need to

1136
00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:33,139
reach out for it right yeah exactly

1137
00:45:31,068 --> 00:45:35,838
it's good this whole internet thing go

1138
00:45:33,139 --> 00:45:37,969
figure information is just available at

1139
00:45:35,838 --> 00:45:41,268
our fingertips at any given time and the

1140
00:45:37,969 --> 00:45:43,639
cannabis industry is no doubt blowing up

1141
00:45:41,268 --> 00:45:46,429
with once again companies like embark

1142
00:45:43,639 --> 00:45:48,018
willing to set and set a new bar and we

1143
00:45:46,429 --> 00:45:49,969
certainly won't be the last and we

1144
00:45:48,018 --> 00:45:51,949
certainly aren't the first to set a new

1145
00:45:49,969 --> 00:45:53,988
bar and that's how things just keep

1146
00:45:51,949 --> 00:45:57,288
escalating and escalating to a point

1147
00:45:53,989 --> 00:45:59,659
where for me I love the idea of I'll

1148
00:45:57,289 --> 00:46:01,369
always love the idea of personal growth

1149
00:45:59,659 --> 00:46:03,558
of people being able to grow their own

1150
00:46:01,369 --> 00:46:05,269
to me that's sacred and people should

1151
00:46:03,559 --> 00:46:07,190
always be able to have that but the

1152
00:46:05,268 --> 00:46:08,808
bottom line is because I have a license

1153
00:46:07,190 --> 00:46:11,329
to grow my own and don't have a plant in

1154
00:46:08,809 --> 00:46:13,130
the ground it's actually a lot of work

1155
00:46:11,329 --> 00:46:14,960
and takes a lot of attention and focus

1156
00:46:13,130 --> 00:46:16,519
and it's not just something you can do

1157
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:18,199
in the background when you have multiple

1158
00:46:16,518 --> 00:46:19,788
kids and five businesses and you get

1159
00:46:18,199 --> 00:46:22,029
pulled in twelve different directions at

1160
00:46:19,789 --> 00:46:24,790
any given time I can't I

1161
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:27,100
have time to grow cannabis to take care

1162
00:46:24,789 --> 00:46:29,349
of it properly and that's that's that's

1163
00:46:27,099 --> 00:46:32,079
the truth for a lot of people so in that

1164
00:46:29,349 --> 00:46:34,539
sense canvas needs to be made accessible

1165
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:37,869
to all those other people who should

1166
00:46:34,539 --> 00:46:39,309
have access to as the same as the person

1167
00:46:37,869 --> 00:46:41,679
who decides they want to grow it for

1168
00:46:39,309 --> 00:46:43,719
themselves and I think what John EB was

1169
00:46:41,679 --> 00:46:46,210
talking about well I know it because I

1170
00:46:43,719 --> 00:46:47,859
used to broker cannabis myself I know

1171
00:46:46,210 --> 00:46:49,990
what good cannabis looks like and what

1172
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:52,599
bad cannabis looks like and when you

1173
00:46:49,989 --> 00:46:54,609
package great cannabis incorrectly at

1174
00:46:52,599 --> 00:46:56,349
the wrong time with the wrong amount of

1175
00:46:54,610 --> 00:46:57,910
moisture for the wrong amount of time

1176
00:46:56,349 --> 00:47:00,670
you destroy it

1177
00:46:57,909 --> 00:47:02,649
you absolutely [ __ ] it up it goes from

1178
00:47:00,670 --> 00:47:05,730
being like whatever they call it now it

1179
00:47:02,650 --> 00:47:10,030
used to be a trip I guess it's a

1180
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:12,579
quadruple a this goes down to like in my

1181
00:47:10,030 --> 00:47:14,890
opinion a see when it just gets wet and

1182
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:16,750
it just gets funky and hade like

1183
00:47:14,889 --> 00:47:18,009
smelling and it doesn't cure outright

1184
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:20,920
and the Terps are [ __ ] and

1185
00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:23,800
everything's [ __ ] that that is not

1186
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:25,570
necessarily on the grower you know

1187
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:27,280
unless he's also the guy that packaged

1188
00:47:25,570 --> 00:47:28,840
it up now if you're working for a

1189
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:30,160
company and you grow some great cannabis

1190
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:32,650
and you give it to the company and then

1191
00:47:30,159 --> 00:47:34,869
they package it incorrectly and you know

1192
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:36,700
go figure as well I think a lot of that

1193
00:47:34,869 --> 00:47:39,250
packaging incorrectly is not accidental

1194
00:47:36,699 --> 00:47:42,009
I think that these that these government

1195
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:44,679
agencies like Health Canada they seem to

1196
00:47:42,010 --> 00:47:46,600
go out of their way to make things not

1197
00:47:44,679 --> 00:47:48,219
as easy as they could be I don't know

1198
00:47:46,599 --> 00:47:50,710
why I've been dealing with them since

1199
00:47:48,219 --> 00:47:53,049
1994 when we applied for a hemp license

1200
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:56,139
and although I will say this about

1201
00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:57,550
Health Canada because it's easy to get

1202
00:47:56,139 --> 00:47:59,109
upset with what they're doing and how

1203
00:47:57,550 --> 00:48:01,660
they're doing it they have at least

1204
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:03,370
grown immensely over the course of the

1205
00:48:01,659 --> 00:48:06,549
last 20 years since they started doing

1206
00:48:03,369 --> 00:48:09,099
licensing in Canada it's amazing how

1207
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:10,630
much more and more and more and more is

1208
00:48:09,099 --> 00:48:12,909
available it hasn't been like an

1209
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:14,619
ironclad like this is what you get and

1210
00:48:12,909 --> 00:48:16,509
this and for the last 20 years that's

1211
00:48:14,619 --> 00:48:18,759
all we've got we've consistently added

1212
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:20,290
more and more things so I suspect it's

1213
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:22,930
like a damn door that will eventually

1214
00:48:20,289 --> 00:48:24,610
burst open and the cannabis

1215
00:48:22,929 --> 00:48:26,829
consciousness will flood through in a

1216
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:28,630
way that they can finally I think we'll

1217
00:48:26,829 --> 00:48:30,340
laugh one day when we look back that we

1218
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:33,340
used to have to treat cannabis like

1219
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:35,710
plutonium with you know level 9 vaults

1220
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:38,230
with biometrics to acquire entry

1221
00:48:35,710 --> 00:48:42,720
like all of these other things no that's

1222
00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:45,760
I don't know I just think as a as a

1223
00:48:42,719 --> 00:48:47,500
industry we could we could commit more

1224
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:48,910
to better things like if you didn't have

1225
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:51,159
to spend two million dollars on your

1226
00:48:48,909 --> 00:48:53,019
vault you could donate like five hundred

1227
00:48:51,159 --> 00:48:54,730
grand to like you know building schools

1228
00:48:53,019 --> 00:48:57,070
somewhere you know helping with

1229
00:48:54,730 --> 00:48:58,630
education or in some way creating

1230
00:48:57,070 --> 00:49:03,789
philanthropy but they just create this

1231
00:48:58,630 --> 00:49:06,010
enormous amount of yeah and we yeah we

1232
00:49:03,789 --> 00:49:07,929
well the other thing is is that I see in

1233
00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:10,089
terms of like packaging we don't have

1234
00:49:07,929 --> 00:49:12,069
the mission we don't have a machine we

1235
00:49:10,088 --> 00:49:13,989
have some machines we're very limited

1236
00:49:12,070 --> 00:49:15,670
I don't listen we don't have machines

1237
00:49:13,989 --> 00:49:18,368
because we do we do have very limited

1238
00:49:15,670 --> 00:49:20,650
machines that are within our reach that

1239
00:49:18,369 --> 00:49:22,960
actually handle the material right we

1240
00:49:20,650 --> 00:49:25,990
just we don't and we we have things like

1241
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:27,940
dog food sorters that are they're trying

1242
00:49:25,989 --> 00:49:30,159
to pass office orders for for our

1243
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:33,159
industry and it's just not the right way

1244
00:49:30,159 --> 00:49:36,069
to do it but I understand how long it

1245
00:49:33,159 --> 00:49:39,219
takes to pack 30,000 units that's a long

1246
00:49:36,070 --> 00:49:41,019
time and yeah so there's nothing else

1247
00:49:39,219 --> 00:49:44,559
like it though is there with these

1248
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:47,099
volatile gases evaporate off the plant

1249
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:49,480
while moisture contents are are also

1250
00:49:47,099 --> 00:49:51,400
evaporating and mixing with the terpenes

1251
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:53,530
in the air and going back into the flood

1252
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:57,608
this is Mel's amazing but it's never

1253
00:49:53,530 --> 00:49:59,800
it's just going into my face oh yeah

1254
00:49:57,608 --> 00:50:01,598
yeah you're right though but yeah it's

1255
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:03,220
we'll get there though I think it's

1256
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:05,980
we're just at the inception a lot of

1257
00:50:03,219 --> 00:50:09,039
those that's the infancy for sure you

1258
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:11,289
know yeah we're just trying and trying a

1259
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:13,088
lot of great people focused on trying to

1260
00:50:11,289 --> 00:50:14,800
make it the best that we can make it you

1261
00:50:13,088 --> 00:50:16,088
know and I don't just mean like the

1262
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:17,830
companies I'm working with I mean

1263
00:50:16,088 --> 00:50:20,019
there's a ton of great people in this

1264
00:50:17,829 --> 00:50:22,179
industry that are kind of focused on and

1265
00:50:20,019 --> 00:50:23,949
I think sometimes people get a little

1266
00:50:22,179 --> 00:50:26,289
like you know kind of like oh who's this

1267
00:50:23,949 --> 00:50:28,509
new person or whatever doing this that

1268
00:50:26,289 --> 00:50:30,550
and the other thing but for me I just

1269
00:50:28,510 --> 00:50:32,530
I'm like a kid in a candy store I'm like

1270
00:50:30,550 --> 00:50:34,119
so excited like I saw canopy announced

1271
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:36,040
Martha Stewart the other day for their

1272
00:50:34,119 --> 00:50:38,740
CBD brand and I was like it just put a

1273
00:50:36,039 --> 00:50:40,119
smile on my face I was like and then of

1274
00:50:38,739 --> 00:50:42,309
course other people were offended by

1275
00:50:40,119 --> 00:50:43,210
what does Martha Stewart know I'm like I

1276
00:50:42,309 --> 00:50:45,759
don't know she just has like a

1277
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:48,460
distribution access to like 409

1278
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:50,710
million women around the world like yeah

1279
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:53,170
what is Martha Stewart know like I just

1280
00:50:50,710 --> 00:50:54,789
I thought it was cool other people they

1281
00:50:53,170 --> 00:50:59,170
didn't think it was so cool I guess but

1282
00:50:54,789 --> 00:51:00,009
the Stewart is solid man she's [ __ ]

1283
00:50:59,170 --> 00:51:03,159
times

1284
00:51:00,010 --> 00:51:05,050
she did her bed I guess I can't be the

1285
00:51:03,159 --> 00:51:07,929
size of it man but but you're right I

1286
00:51:05,050 --> 00:51:10,720
mean canopy's smart man they came in you

1287
00:51:07,929 --> 00:51:12,519
know I you know they're not they're not

1288
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:15,609
you know they're a tough one they're

1289
00:51:12,519 --> 00:51:17,019
they're very very aggressive company man

1290
00:51:15,610 --> 00:51:20,079
you know hey hey

1291
00:51:17,019 --> 00:51:23,170
regardless I feel self-conscious you

1292
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:25,989
know I think everybody on not me not me

1293
00:51:23,170 --> 00:51:27,970
I saw that well

1294
00:51:25,989 --> 00:51:29,889
now the reality of Hallie not hanging

1295
00:51:27,969 --> 00:51:31,719
around us and it's so large and out of

1296
00:51:29,889 --> 00:51:34,059
control that it's it's really puts a

1297
00:51:31,719 --> 00:51:37,239
reality spin on it I'll be honest I saw

1298
00:51:34,059 --> 00:51:39,880
that simply as I'm gonna supply them

1299
00:51:37,239 --> 00:51:42,009
with CBD hey some people find

1300
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:43,030
opportunity absolutely I totally see

1301
00:51:42,010 --> 00:51:46,000
that

1302
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:47,950
yeah no doubt it's it's a listen anytime

1303
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,530
there's someone's pushing a cannabinoid

1304
00:51:47,949 --> 00:51:52,419
I find that positive yeah I mean I don't

1305
00:51:50,530 --> 00:51:56,670
know how's everything awful Martha

1306
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:56,670
Stewart did her bid right D she did

1307
00:51:56,699 --> 00:52:08,349
that's funny I love all the different

1308
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:10,599
perspectives from her church I can just

1309
00:52:08,349 --> 00:52:12,099
imagine someone who's never been on hash

1310
00:52:10,599 --> 00:52:14,110
Church before talking about this

1311
00:52:12,099 --> 00:52:15,969
tomorrow at work when they're like we're

1312
00:52:14,110 --> 00:52:18,220
talking and when that guy when that guy

1313
00:52:15,969 --> 00:52:21,169
in the Slayer shirt said she did her bid

1314
00:52:18,219 --> 00:52:26,500
I fell off my chair

1315
00:52:21,170 --> 00:52:26,500
[Laughter]

1316
00:52:28,289 --> 00:52:37,199
she didn't whether she's solid

1317
00:52:31,630 --> 00:52:40,599
yes exactly these are solid even solid

1318
00:52:37,199 --> 00:52:42,309
solid oh my goodness thank God for

1319
00:52:40,599 --> 00:52:45,029
having a hashed Church today I've missed

1320
00:52:42,309 --> 00:52:51,250
it I'll be honest I needed one of these

1321
00:52:45,030 --> 00:52:53,200
huh had to be done so I should mention a

1322
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:54,519
few things because there's all these

1323
00:52:53,199 --> 00:52:56,619
other things that are coming up and

1324
00:52:54,519 --> 00:52:59,130
happening let me see if I can figure

1325
00:52:56,619 --> 00:53:01,139
this out actually because

1326
00:52:59,130 --> 00:53:04,590
this is somewhat important I want to

1327
00:53:01,139 --> 00:53:06,900
have a few announcements to make so yeah

1328
00:53:04,590 --> 00:53:08,250
announcements but I have to be smart how

1329
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:09,599
I make the announcements I thought

1330
00:53:08,250 --> 00:53:12,480
better than talking about it I would

1331
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:14,460
kind of show it but it's on Instagram so

1332
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:19,110
it's not quite and I don't even know if

1333
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:20,519
he sent it to me oh my god did he know

1334
00:53:19,110 --> 00:53:22,890
it's on here

1335
00:53:20,519 --> 00:53:25,400
I wonder how I'm gonna be able to maybe

1336
00:53:22,889 --> 00:53:28,349
I can repost it is that what I can do

1337
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:31,230
sorry for sounding like a 65 year old

1338
00:53:28,349 --> 00:53:33,539
like never been on technology before I

1339
00:53:31,230 --> 00:53:36,059
don't know what these buttons are doing

1340
00:53:33,539 --> 00:53:37,230
now also saw read all my 65 year old

1341
00:53:36,059 --> 00:53:41,130
friends because that was a terrible

1342
00:53:37,230 --> 00:53:45,150
stereotype oh my goodness okay so I was

1343
00:53:41,130 --> 00:53:48,000
going to announce the I'm gonna be a

1344
00:53:45,150 --> 00:53:51,599
judge well first first first things

1345
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:54,780
first the team at embark is heading to

1346
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:57,150
the ICBC conference in Spain March 14th

1347
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:58,980
so that's gonna be really cool that's

1348
00:53:57,150 --> 00:54:01,740
what Alex Rogers who was on hash Church

1349
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:05,760
the last time talking about it actually

1350
00:54:01,739 --> 00:54:07,979
and so we have will be there well we I

1351
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:09,510
think I'm speaking on a panel and then

1352
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:11,519
the after-party is gonna be lit it's

1353
00:54:09,510 --> 00:54:15,450
Damian Marley which I'm pretty stoked

1354
00:54:11,519 --> 00:54:17,849
about having an after-party at the W it

1355
00:54:15,449 --> 00:54:19,710
with Damian Marley and Barcelona that's

1356
00:54:17,849 --> 00:54:21,509
just gonna be surreal to say the least

1357
00:54:19,710 --> 00:54:23,130
so hopefully anyone that's coming to

1358
00:54:21,510 --> 00:54:24,900

1361
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:35,009
that's that's in Barcelona in the

1362
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:36,420
hospital at Zone and it'll be the same

1363
00:54:35,010 --> 00:54:37,830
area that it's always been in and I'll

1364
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:40,170
probably be walking around and cruising

1365
00:54:37,829 --> 00:54:43,349
around and then also I'm going to be

1366
00:54:40,170 --> 00:54:46,920
this is a full circle with HQ hemp

1367
00:54:43,349 --> 00:54:50,099
quarters in Barcelona the first place I

1368
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:53,670

00:55:01,710 --> 00:55:05,849
of really cool people that were judges I

1375
00:55:03,809 --> 00:55:07,710
hadn't been in touch with him to let him

1376
00:55:05,849 --> 00:55:09,299
know that I was going but I did let him

1377
00:55:07,710 --> 00:55:12,809
know I was going a couple weeks ago and

1378
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:15,120
I guess Jerome Baker Jason Harris wasn't

1379
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:17,190
able to make it so his spot dropped and

1380
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:22,199
so David called me and now I'm gonna be

1381
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:23,490
a judge in that Wow what an amazing time

although you are reverberating right now

1384
00:55:25,230 --> 00:55:30,960
because the next thing I'm getting to is

1385
00:55:27,630 --> 00:55:38,460
the legends of hash actually I like the

1386

1389
00:55:41,550 --> 00:55:47,550

1390
00:55:44,369 --> 00:55:51,029
this year and we're gonna be doing it

1391
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:55,170
with flat four-to-one and flux who's I

1392
00:55:51,030 --> 00:55:57,060
guess got himself a spot in Barcelona so

1393
00:55:55,170 --> 00:56:00,389
we're gonna be kind of breaking that in

1394
00:55:57,059 --> 00:56:02,730
with the legends of hash there's a

1395
00:56:00,389 --> 00:56:04,980
legends of hash there's no trophies

1396
00:56:02,730 --> 00:56:06,599
there's no like announcements of like

1397
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:08,190
this that the other thing it's just like

1398
00:56:06,599 --> 00:56:10,110
if you want to come and smoke some hash

1399
00:56:08,190 --> 00:56:12,119
we'll have some people judging there

1400
00:56:10,110 --> 00:56:13,980
will be a small announcement that you

1401
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:15,599
know first second and third and why the

1402
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:17,369
judges thought that but really that's

1403
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:20,880
the main the main thing is to come

1404
00:56:17,369 --> 00:56:23,219

00:58:25,159 --> 00:58:27,980
have been the chat center I can't

1449
00:58:26,809 --> 00:58:31,250
remember it was a cool building on the

1450
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:32,570
UBC campus really cool round like it

1451
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:34,190
just had a really great look to it and

1452
00:58:32,570 --> 00:58:36,710
he did a bunch of interviews with Kurt I

1453
00:58:34,190 --> 00:58:38,480
saw John Conroy and and Chris Bennett

1454
00:58:36,710 --> 00:58:40,699
and myself and a whole bunch of other

1455
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:42,980
people so they if you check out move the

1456
00:58:40,699 --> 00:58:44,960
movement it's it's really great thing

1457
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:46,730
that they're doing kind of getting these

1458
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:48,860
great stories out of the community in a

1459
00:58:46,730 --> 00:58:50,449
really professional manner editing

1460
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:52,539
really to perfection and then and then

1461
00:58:50,449 --> 00:58:55,519
putting it out as a very enjoyable story

1462
00:58:52,539 --> 00:58:57,800
they're gonna be coming to Spain with us

1463
00:58:55,519 --> 00:59:01,159
and they're gonna film I guess two full

1464
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:04,400
days with us so or with me and the crew

1465
00:59:01,159 --> 00:59:06,139
and so I don't know exactly what those

1466
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:08,059
two days will be but I suspect it will

1467
00:59:06,139 --> 00:59:09,679
for sure be the ICBC conference because

1468
00:59:08,059 --> 00:59:11,539
that'll be a whole day and then

1469
00:59:09,679 --> 00:59:12,949
hopefully he'll do like a section of

1470
00:59:11,539 --> 00:59:16,599
masters of rosin because there'll be

1471
00:59:12,949 --> 00:59:19,009
some great footage there as well as a

1472
00:59:16,599 --> 00:59:20,839
portion of the legends which is going to

1473
00:59:19,010 --> 00:59:23,480
be the first time I know Sam's probably

1474
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:24,620
like what it's like yeah if you know

1475
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:29,360
this will be the first time we've

1476
00:59:24,619 --> 00:59:31,400
actually allowed anyone to take video

1477
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:33,559
but there also won't be the same group

1478
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:35,690
of people that were particularly on

1479
00:59:33,559 --> 00:59:37,838
video over the last 20 years

1480
00:59:35,690 --> 00:59:39,938
however if Scott man Sam does

1481
00:59:37,838 --> 00:59:43,239
it's to grace us with his presence there

1482
00:59:39,938 --> 00:59:50,259
will not be video anywhere near here he

1483
00:59:43,239 --> 00:59:53,708
is oh my god who's that guy in the Bella

1484
00:59:50,259 --> 00:59:57,099
klava so how are you doing skunkman Sam

1485
00:59:53,708 --> 01:00:00,818
how are things in Amsterdam it's okay

1486
00:59:57,099 --> 01:00:05,019
and when you come to the EU are you just

1487
01:00:00,818 --> 01:00:07,778
going to Spain I tried to come through

1488
01:00:05,018 --> 01:00:12,188
Amsterdam and KLM was all sold out so I

1489
01:00:07,778 --> 01:00:14,018
ended up having to go through Germany so

1490
01:00:12,188 --> 01:00:16,449
because there's no direct flights for me

1491
01:00:14,018 --> 01:00:19,028
probably need your vibrations more than

1492
01:00:16,449 --> 01:00:20,499
Amsterdam well I was kind of hoping I

1493
01:00:19,028 --> 01:00:22,809
won't lie that I was going to be able to

1494
01:00:20,498 --> 01:00:23,379
spend at least the day with with you and

1495
01:00:22,809 --> 01:00:25,719
yours

1496
01:00:23,380 --> 01:00:27,249
that's what I was trying to make happen

1497
01:00:25,719 --> 01:00:29,318
and I couldn't believe it personally

1498
01:00:27,248 --> 01:00:31,118
because I booked the flight like a week

1499
01:00:29,318 --> 01:00:32,920
and a half ago or something and it's not

1500
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:34,269
for another couple of weeks

1501
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:37,420
I guess it's less than a couple of weeks

1502
01:00:34,268 --> 01:00:41,108
now Wow jeez times really flying here in

1503
01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:42,420
your people book page three months six

1504
01:00:41,108 --> 01:00:45,518
months in advance

1505
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:46,989
Jesus how did they do that how could you

1506
01:00:45,518 --> 01:00:56,608
possibly know where you're going to be

1507
01:00:46,989 --> 01:01:00,309
with their working schedule oh my god

1508
01:00:56,608 --> 01:01:03,009
what a nightmare I guess that's why I've

1509
01:01:00,309 --> 01:01:07,689
been told to avoid certain places during

1510
01:01:03,009 --> 01:01:10,028
certain times in like the South in the

1511
01:01:07,688 --> 01:01:15,899
Mediterranean you know Italy France

1512
01:01:10,028 --> 01:01:18,608
Spain the islands menorca Majorca Abita

1513
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:20,469
they just fill up with people like you

1514
01:01:18,608 --> 01:01:22,150
said at the all at the exact same time

1515
01:01:20,469 --> 01:01:24,880
like it's probably dead the day before

1516
01:01:22,150 --> 01:01:27,849
and then literally the next day it's

1517
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:30,849
like at full capacity and they're all on

1518
01:01:27,849 --> 01:01:34,809
the roads and they're all flying they're

1519
01:01:30,849 --> 01:01:37,920
all driving every you just yeah it's not

1520
01:01:34,809 --> 01:01:41,140
so fun now I can't deal with that I

1521
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:42,699
can't deal with that well it was a

1522
01:01:41,139 --> 01:01:44,889
last-minute hashed Church today

1523
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:48,818
did you did you actually mention the

1524
01:01:44,889 --> 01:01:49,929
company yet Colin or no yeah I did I did

1525
01:01:48,818 --> 01:01:58,389
a while back okay

1526
01:01:49,929 --> 01:02:00,219
cuz I was happy yeah man it's really

1527
01:01:58,389 --> 01:02:04,598
exciting because we you know we spent so

1528
01:02:00,219 --> 01:02:06,189
much time behind the scenes over the

1529
01:02:04,599 --> 01:02:08,920
past two decades that it's really nice

1530
01:02:06,190 --> 01:02:11,500
to come out with an outfit that allows

1531
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:13,180
us to come into the market man and it's

1532
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:15,489
it's it feels really special to be able

1533
01:02:13,179 --> 01:02:18,250
to be a part of that and a way that we

1534
01:02:15,489 --> 01:02:21,039
get to kind of do it our way and that's

1535
01:02:18,250 --> 01:02:23,769
that's really you know that's that's

1536
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:25,989
what I'm looking forward to so you're

1537
01:02:23,769 --> 01:02:27,849
sure it's exciting big big things big

1538
01:02:25,989 --> 01:02:29,469
things I mean I think listen I've known

1539
01:02:27,849 --> 01:02:30,880
you for almost 20 years as well and I'm

1540
01:02:29,469 --> 01:02:32,889
going through the exact same thing you

1541
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:35,289
know this is exciting time finally

1542
01:02:32,889 --> 01:02:37,868
having a team together that can execute

1543
01:02:35,289 --> 01:02:42,130
a plan you know not having to of like

1544
01:02:37,869 --> 01:02:44,559
you know sold my soul to an LP like I

1545
01:02:42,130 --> 01:02:46,838
avoided that and just to create my own

1546
01:02:44,559 --> 01:02:48,730
thing like create our own thing that's

1547
01:02:46,838 --> 01:02:51,489
exactly that's different from from

1548
01:02:48,730 --> 01:02:54,818
anything else so you know definitely the

1549
01:02:51,489 --> 01:02:56,439
the the best of Luck's to the embarks

1550

we're I think we're good we're excited

1553
01:03:01,510 --> 01:03:06,760
to be be good stewards of the plant and

1554
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:09,099
preservation s of genetics and make sure

1555
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:10,869
that these things live on in a way that

1556
01:03:09,099 --> 01:03:14,318
they get to be able to be used by by as

1557
01:03:10,869 --> 01:03:16,869
many patients as we can and you know

1558
01:03:14,318 --> 01:03:18,279
that's part of the just part of the

1559
01:03:16,869 --> 01:03:20,519
process you know going through all the

1560
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:26,349
stock and going through old stock and

1561
01:03:20,519 --> 01:03:28,838
it'll be fun absolutely you know but

1562
01:03:26,349 --> 01:03:31,930
yeah so I've got to get going guys but

1563
01:03:28,838 --> 01:03:34,298
um I appreciate the time that I spent

1564
01:03:31,929 --> 01:03:37,328
with y'all and I look forward to being

1565
01:03:34,298 --> 01:03:39,280

1566
01:03:37,329 --> 01:03:41,680
dude I appreciate it last minute as well

1567
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:44,200
I put the word out to about 20 folks so

1568
01:03:41,679 --> 01:03:46,629
I was happy to get you know five five

1569
01:03:44,199 --> 01:03:48,489
six people come in that was great yeah

1570
01:03:46,630 --> 01:03:50,349
Sam always an honor to be on with you I

1571
01:03:48,489 --> 01:03:53,139
would love to ask you a million

1572
01:03:50,349 --> 01:03:56,079
questions but I've got to get going but

1573
01:03:53,139 --> 01:04:00,250
I was gonna ask you a question too about

1574
01:03:56,079 --> 01:04:02,900
preservation of a variety yeah please

1575
01:04:00,250 --> 01:04:05,449
this variety or clone

1576
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:08,230
right because preservation of seed

1577
01:04:05,449 --> 01:04:12,259
varieties that's a lot of work you got a

1578
01:04:08,230 --> 01:04:15,019
reproducible at least 2,000 individual

1579
01:04:12,260 --> 01:04:18,140
plant can be every year no doubt so

1580
01:04:15,019 --> 01:04:21,199
that's that's a great question so it's

1581
01:04:18,139 --> 01:04:23,509
now that I have the space to do it it's

1582
01:04:21,199 --> 01:04:26,239
going to be I'm going to get into

1583
01:04:23,510 --> 01:04:29,930
preservation of seed form before it was

1584
01:04:26,239 --> 01:04:32,689
all about just preserving specific

1585
01:04:29,929 --> 01:04:36,500
cultivars and phenotypes and now it's

1586
01:04:32,690 --> 01:04:39,019
about going in and actually preserving

1587
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:41,150
lines in a way I've never even had

1588
01:04:39,019 --> 01:04:44,500
access to do it you know I've never

1589
01:04:41,150 --> 01:04:48,710
really had I've never been able to to

1590
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:50,239
not only just mono crop so this is a

1591
01:04:48,710 --> 01:04:54,048
really unique situation for me to be

1592
01:04:50,239 --> 01:04:59,449
able to have upwards to 15,000 square

1593
01:04:54,048 --> 01:05:03,199
feet just to preserve and explore I've

1594
01:04:59,449 --> 01:05:06,739
been doing it a long time and we we came

1595
01:05:03,199 --> 01:05:12,828
up with the minimum number is 2,000 for

1596
01:05:06,739 --> 01:05:15,139
a male female variety well that's yeah I

1597
01:05:12,829 --> 01:05:17,059
share that same sentiment and I'd love

1598
01:05:15,139 --> 01:05:18,618
to learn a bit more about your your

1599
01:05:17,059 --> 01:05:20,420
ideologies and what you've learned over

1600
01:05:18,619 --> 01:05:22,220
the years obviously you've spent

1601
01:05:20,420 --> 01:05:25,190
tremendous amount of times with the

1602
01:05:22,219 --> 01:05:27,409
plant and in numerous sized facilities

1603
01:05:25,190 --> 01:05:29,450
and I think it I can only benefit from

1604
01:05:27,409 --> 01:05:31,219
your knowledge you know so it it would

1605
01:05:29,449 --> 01:05:34,548
be awesome to sit down with you and talk

1606
01:05:31,219 --> 01:05:41,048
about that and in terms of numbers what

1607
01:05:34,548 --> 01:05:44,690
have you seen at mm well it's genetics

1608
01:05:41,048 --> 01:05:51,650
statistical analysis if you have less

1609
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:55,929
than 2000 then you're not preserving the

1610
01:05:51,650 --> 01:05:58,369
genes in that variety you're preserving

1611
01:05:55,929 --> 01:06:00,588
right so you're okay that makes a lot of

1612
01:05:58,369 --> 01:06:03,230
sense so you're basically at that under

1613
01:06:00,588 --> 01:06:06,199
2000 year basically selective breeding

1614
01:06:03,230 --> 01:06:09,528
or really selective preservation a

1615
01:06:06,199 --> 01:06:12,259
selective preservation not the entire

1616
01:06:09,528 --> 01:06:15,590
gene pool of that

1617
01:06:12,260 --> 01:06:21,410
variety exactly right okay that makes a

1618
01:06:15,590 --> 01:06:24,500
lot of sense um a lot yeah okay so in

1619
01:06:21,409 --> 01:06:27,108
terms of a hybrid variety that's maybe a

1620
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:29,269
poly bridge well a hybrid you do you

1621
01:06:27,108 --> 01:06:31,009
think that more seeds need to be kept

1622
01:06:29,269 --> 01:06:37,940
because there's more genetic variation

1623
01:06:31,010 --> 01:06:40,190
happening I mean there you're not going

1624
01:06:37,940 --> 01:06:43,369
to be keeping the same material because

1625
01:06:40,190 --> 01:06:49,099
you'll be what twos and threes

1626
01:06:43,369 --> 01:06:52,490
I mean they segregate out right that

1627
01:06:49,099 --> 01:06:55,099
makes sense and do you believe in in

1628
01:06:52,489 --> 01:06:57,799
preservation specifically precious

1629
01:06:55,099 --> 01:07:00,440
preservation do you believe open

1630
01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:03,670
pollination with many males is is the

1631
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:08,960
only way to preserve or mind race

1632
01:07:03,670 --> 01:07:10,639
absolutely it's the only way or so all

1633
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:16,608
you young guys out there listening in

1634
01:07:10,639 --> 01:07:21,618
take note to this land race that's the

1635
01:07:16,608 --> 01:07:23,900
man so that makes a lot of sense because

1636
01:07:21,619 --> 01:07:26,119
you know today what we have is is is

1637
01:07:23,900 --> 01:07:27,559
mostly what I would call very limited

1638
01:07:26,119 --> 01:07:30,440
selective breeding going on

1639
01:07:27,559 --> 01:07:32,779
so we're scoping sewed and our lens is

1640
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:37,970
so narrow that when we do find something

1641
01:07:32,780 --> 01:07:39,920
desirable it just makes you wonder how

1642
01:07:37,969 --> 01:07:41,659
many other desirable traits are in that

1643
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:44,180
that same gene pool if they're actually

1644
01:07:41,659 --> 01:07:49,940
at the space to run it if you think

1645
01:07:44,179 --> 01:07:53,149
about how land races are created people

1646
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:56,000
start growing cannabis in a particular

1647
01:07:53,150 --> 01:08:01,869
area whether that's Afghanistan or

1648
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:07,179
Thailand or Burma or wherever and they

1649
01:08:01,869 --> 01:08:10,369
but the deep pool there is limited by

1650
01:08:07,179 --> 01:08:12,469
its a large population that's a farmers

1651
01:08:10,369 --> 01:08:14,930
over for thousands and thousands of

1652
01:08:12,469 --> 01:08:19,219
thousands of plants sometimes even

1653
01:08:14,929 --> 01:08:23,389
bigger and but it it's cut off from of

1654
01:08:19,220 --> 01:08:25,349
the gene flow so it it becomes it

1655
01:08:23,390 --> 01:08:28,650
travels down and because

1656
01:08:25,349 --> 01:08:33,599
it's own land rates that don't variety

1657
01:08:28,649 --> 01:08:35,670
with a unique set of genes and terpenes

1658
01:08:33,599 --> 01:08:39,779
and cannabinoids and that's what you

1659
01:08:35,670 --> 01:08:42,980
want preserve everything right okay so

1660
01:08:39,779 --> 01:08:46,440
here's a question for you in terms of

1661
01:08:42,979 --> 01:08:49,289
land race varieties what I'm seeing a

1662
01:08:46,439 --> 01:08:51,210
lot today is a lot of people are going

1663
01:08:49,289 --> 01:08:52,439
out trekking out there and collecting

1664
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:54,179
some land race and then they're

1665
01:08:52,439 --> 01:08:55,738
furthering the line maybe they're doing

1666
01:08:54,179 --> 01:08:57,630
some young reading and then

1667
01:08:55,738 --> 01:08:59,309
predominantly a lot of the people I've

1668
01:08:57,630 --> 01:09:00,989
talked to that ran that same variety

1669
01:08:59,310 --> 01:09:03,089
they're getting a lot of hermaphrodite

1670
01:09:00,988 --> 01:09:04,738
traits because they're running him in

1671
01:09:03,088 --> 01:09:07,229
for environments that they're just the

1672
01:09:04,738 --> 01:09:09,899
these didn't program the genetics itself

1673
01:09:07,229 --> 01:09:12,000
are just so far into it itself that it

1674
01:09:09,899 --> 01:09:13,920
just starts to have adverse reactions to

1675
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:16,380
it what are your thoughts on inbreeding

1676
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:18,389
those types of lines to make them

1677
01:09:16,380 --> 01:09:20,509
readily available or we try to damaging

1678
01:09:18,389 --> 01:09:23,130
those lines by doing things like that

1679
01:09:20,509 --> 01:09:26,270
well I don't know what you mean by

1680
01:09:23,130 --> 01:09:29,190
inbreeding or inbreeding or hybridize

1681
01:09:26,270 --> 01:09:31,380
well you're taking let's say we find a

1682
01:09:29,189 --> 01:09:34,198
male and a female of of the same variety

1683
01:09:31,380 --> 01:09:36,659
and then we make more seeds out of that

1684
01:09:34,198 --> 01:09:39,778
okay and but we narrow the scope by only

1685
01:09:36,658 --> 01:09:42,000
having like a few different females and

1686
01:09:39,779 --> 01:09:44,849
maybe five or ten different females and

1687
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:47,279
five to the 20 males that are

1688
01:09:44,849 --> 01:09:51,420
pollinating these things it's clearly

1689
01:09:47,279 --> 01:09:55,320
not enough to to preserve the doctor

1690
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:59,578
people but you may preserve two really

1691
01:09:55,319 --> 01:10:01,979
nice good examples and a segment of that

1692
01:09:59,578 --> 01:10:04,019
gene pool you might preserve and it

1693
01:10:01,979 --> 01:10:05,098
might be really interesting I can't say

1694
01:10:04,020 --> 01:10:07,349
without gene

1695
01:10:05,099 --> 01:10:09,389
sure okay well that kind of answers it

1696
01:10:07,349 --> 01:10:12,599
because they I think a lot of people are

1697
01:10:09,389 --> 01:10:14,250
that I've talked to outside of my

1698
01:10:12,599 --> 01:10:17,190
personal experience are finding a lot of

1699
01:10:14,250 --> 01:10:19,109
hermaphrodite traits coming out because

1700
01:10:17,189 --> 01:10:20,549
they're running them inside and in a

1701
01:10:19,109 --> 01:10:24,658
very under lighting that they're not

1702
01:10:20,550 --> 01:10:28,469
used to I have not really seen for my

1703
01:10:24,658 --> 01:10:32,638
product being expressed by that I mean

1704
01:10:28,469 --> 01:10:35,969
if variety does not have intersex genes

1705
01:10:32,639 --> 01:10:39,170
then usually [ __ ] it around with it

1706
01:10:35,969 --> 01:10:42,289
doesn't really change

1707
01:10:39,170 --> 01:10:46,329
I've seen step remember lights or grown

1708
01:10:42,289 --> 01:10:49,609
in greenhouses and that or breathe or

1709
01:10:46,329 --> 01:10:53,988
outdoors in the ground then doesn't seem

1710
01:10:49,609 --> 01:10:56,389
to really change alter the the intersex

1711
01:10:53,988 --> 01:10:59,149
expression particularly that I've seen

1712
01:10:56,390 --> 01:11:02,440
now there are some there are certain

1713
01:10:59,149 --> 01:11:06,189
varieties like ty we learn tentacley

1714
01:11:02,439 --> 01:11:09,889
intersex just because they were from

1715
01:11:06,189 --> 01:11:13,429
tamiya for hundreds if not thousands of

1716
01:11:09,890 --> 01:11:15,260
years and the few seeds that they did

1717
01:11:13,430 --> 01:11:18,739
found were very likely caused by

1718
01:11:15,260 --> 01:11:20,300
intersect sure I always think it's to be

1719
01:11:18,738 --> 01:11:21,889
honest when when I hear people tell me

1720
01:11:20,300 --> 01:11:23,480
those things I always believe it's their

1721
01:11:21,890 --> 01:11:27,020
environment that's causing the problems

1722
01:11:23,479 --> 01:11:29,839
not the not the actual genetics so that

1723
01:11:27,020 --> 01:11:33,950
that kind of reaffirms well I've got

1724
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:36,680
I've come across varieties that you no

1725
01:11:33,949 --> 01:11:39,139
matter what kind of environmental stress

1726
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:43,489
you put on them it they would not

1727
01:11:39,140 --> 01:11:46,520
express any sort of intersex expression

1728
01:11:43,488 --> 01:11:48,139
and all the new book and I be

1729
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:50,390
interesting to take those to where

1730
01:11:48,140 --> 01:11:51,940
you're talking about and you try to make

1731
01:11:50,390 --> 01:11:54,829
them turn intersex

1732
01:11:51,939 --> 01:11:57,079
yeah well it's it'll be interesting you

1733
01:11:54,829 --> 01:11:59,659
know I've got a few varieties there's

1734
01:11:57,079 --> 01:12:01,460
some Iranian varieties that I've I was

1735
01:11:59,659 --> 01:12:04,639
given that I'm very interested to run

1736
01:12:01,460 --> 01:12:07,489
and a few things from Morocco and Nepal

1737
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:09,800
that should be really interesting to run

1738
01:12:07,488 --> 01:12:12,109
in the coming months them I'm actually

1739
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:14,570
really excited about the biggest problem

1740
01:12:12,109 --> 01:12:18,979
too is when people collect land receipts

1741
01:12:14,569 --> 01:12:21,319
today is are they pure for example in

1742
01:12:18,979 --> 01:12:23,750
Morocco there are no pure land races

1743
01:12:21,319 --> 01:12:29,059
they're all gone the same thing in

1744
01:12:23,750 --> 01:12:31,640
Jamaica and probably in Mexico and any

1745
01:12:29,060 --> 01:12:35,239
other country were lots of Westerners

1746
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:37,940
though and take seeds to help the locals

1747
01:12:35,238 --> 01:12:41,089
so here's another good question in terms

1748
01:12:37,939 --> 01:12:43,429
of land truthy and so I I've actually I

1749
01:12:41,090 --> 01:12:45,650
share that same ideology where it's like

1750
01:12:43,430 --> 01:12:47,690
I don't I feel like at this day and age

1751
01:12:45,649 --> 01:12:50,809
it's almost nearly impossible to find

1752
01:12:47,689 --> 01:12:52,399
true land race unless you really go very

1753
01:12:50,810 --> 01:12:54,140
very deep

1754
01:12:52,399 --> 01:12:57,170
and that takes a lot of effort and not

1755
01:12:54,140 --> 01:13:00,710
everybody's built for that but I think

1756
01:12:57,170 --> 01:13:06,969
what I saw technically it's illegal

1757
01:13:00,710 --> 01:13:09,980
today because but there are genetic

1758
01:13:06,969 --> 01:13:13,550
treaties worldwide but all the countries

1759
01:13:09,979 --> 01:13:18,079
are signatory to that says you cannot go

1760
01:13:13,550 --> 01:13:22,279
and take genes from a country like

1761
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:24,590
Thailand or India or wherever and take

1762
01:13:22,279 --> 01:13:27,109
them back to America reproduce them and

1763
01:13:24,590 --> 01:13:29,840
sell them for profit without cherry with

1764
01:13:27,109 --> 01:13:33,589
both the government and the farmers and

1765
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:35,719
etc etc that's all that wasn't there

1766
01:13:33,590 --> 01:13:38,810
when I was collecting seeds but it's

1767
01:13:35,719 --> 01:13:41,750
there now yeah I would imagine you know

1768
01:13:38,810 --> 01:13:44,060
when you were avidly collecting in that

1769
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:46,279
in that way that you would probably come

1770
01:13:44,060 --> 01:13:47,480
across things that and I'm sure you

1771
01:13:46,279 --> 01:13:50,479
probably still have some of these things

1772
01:13:47,479 --> 01:13:54,709
that are occurring expressions out that

1773
01:13:50,479 --> 01:13:56,869
are just not seen today at all and not

1774
01:13:54,710 --> 01:14:01,399
see that's pretty exciting place to be

1775
01:13:56,869 --> 01:14:04,010
Sam and also really is is all the

1776
01:14:01,399 --> 01:14:08,509
different cannabinoids in Turkey in

1777
01:14:04,010 --> 01:14:12,199
different expressions of ratios and well

1778
01:14:08,510 --> 01:14:16,810
also to some plant or auto some plants

1779
01:14:12,199 --> 01:14:20,750
are are all female so I mean there are

1780
01:14:16,810 --> 01:14:24,200
wide leaps skin elite them early late

1781
01:14:20,750 --> 01:14:28,130
maturing etcetera etcetera but I mean

1782
01:14:24,199 --> 01:14:32,500
really it's the terpenes with THC as a

1783
01:14:28,130 --> 01:14:36,500
recreational user firstly am interested

1784
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:38,420
absolutely and the the idea that you

1785
01:14:36,500 --> 01:14:40,579
know we've come across that the single

1786
01:14:38,420 --> 01:14:43,699
cannabinoid is therapeutic is really

1787
01:14:40,579 --> 01:14:46,488
interesting to me do you think through

1788
01:14:43,699 --> 01:14:50,750
the years of you being involved in

1789
01:14:46,488 --> 01:14:52,629
cannabinoids was there such a heavy you

1790
01:14:50,750 --> 01:14:55,369
know did they always weigh so much

1791
01:14:52,630 --> 01:14:57,890
strength into a single cannabinoid or is

1792
01:14:55,369 --> 01:14:59,210
this do you feel this is really twenty

1793
01:14:57,890 --> 01:15:02,470
or twenty first century thing

1794
01:14:59,210 --> 01:15:07,329
I mean recreational cannabis

1795
01:15:02,470 --> 01:15:09,970
it was pretty much all THC ganja if you

1796
01:15:07,329 --> 01:15:12,789
analyze that it was pretty much just THC

1797
01:15:09,970 --> 01:15:16,780
now hashish also had other cannabinoids

1798
01:15:12,789 --> 01:15:18,789
because it wasn't picked for they didn't

1799
01:15:16,779 --> 01:15:21,069
smoke individual plants the way they do

1800
01:15:18,789 --> 01:15:23,470
with ganja so you could save the seeds

1801
01:15:21,069 --> 01:15:26,439
of the best pretty easy you just get the

1802
01:15:23,470 --> 01:15:28,840
most residents the biggest yield and the

1803
01:15:26,439 --> 01:15:31,119
best quality because you smoke it but

1804
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:34,180
with hashish they collected the most

1805
01:15:31,119 --> 01:15:37,569
resinous plants so sometimes it was all

1806
01:15:34,180 --> 01:15:40,300
THC and sometimes it wasn't but Cente

1807
01:15:37,569 --> 01:15:43,049
were smoking resin from a field not from

1808
01:15:40,300 --> 01:15:45,909
individual plants nobody really knew

1809
01:15:43,050 --> 01:15:47,440
right and that's the that's the weird

1810
01:15:45,909 --> 01:15:49,389
place that we're in now as we know so

1811
01:15:47,439 --> 01:15:51,369
much and we continue to learn so much

1812
01:15:49,390 --> 01:15:54,579
that it's you know it's like peridot you

1813
01:15:51,369 --> 01:15:56,489
know it's just opening up a whole vortex

1814
01:15:54,579 --> 01:16:00,579
you know but that's interesting I

1815
01:15:56,489 --> 01:16:02,760
appreciate that insight in terms of like

1816
01:16:00,579 --> 01:16:06,100
now here's another question in terms of

1817
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:08,170
terpene profile you know we you know the

1818
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:12,850
Western world is landed on this gassy

1819
01:16:08,170 --> 01:16:14,619
diesel II cami thing you know I've seen

1820
01:16:12,850 --> 01:16:22,329
that in a lot of Afghan for right

1821
01:16:14,619 --> 01:16:26,590
Afghanistan or like you know any like a

1822
01:16:22,329 --> 01:16:28,539
sit role like sitar l that are that

1823
01:16:26,590 --> 01:16:32,440
expressed those types of traits or is

1824
01:16:28,539 --> 01:16:34,689
that very much do you believe in you

1825
01:16:32,439 --> 01:16:39,279
know just coming out of just being a

1826
01:16:34,689 --> 01:16:41,500
hybrid you know enough poly hybrid or

1827
01:16:39,279 --> 01:16:44,949
those types of in terms of land race or

1828
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:48,100
those types of smells foreign to you or

1829
01:16:44,949 --> 01:16:52,689
they are they very familiar I'm not sure

1830
01:16:48,100 --> 01:16:55,090
if it is because it's a hybrid in other

1831
01:16:52,689 --> 01:16:58,119
words the diesel and that kind of stuff

1832
01:16:55,090 --> 01:17:00,760
yeah I'm not sure I don't have a deep

1833
01:16:58,119 --> 01:17:03,309
background with diesel so I can't really

1834
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:06,930
speak of Lauren gently but but one thing

1835
01:17:03,310 --> 01:17:11,020
I can tell you is absolutely people

1836
01:17:06,930 --> 01:17:14,350
prefer high terpene contents their

1837
01:17:11,020 --> 01:17:15,610
particular individual trip means they

1838
01:17:14,350 --> 01:17:19,060
enjoy my

1839
01:17:15,609 --> 01:17:21,039
different for each person by absolutely

1840
01:17:19,060 --> 01:17:24,159
it's better and traditionally it was

1841
01:17:21,039 --> 01:17:26,800
hard to find because cannabis by the

1842
01:17:24,158 --> 01:17:30,039
time it arrived in America if it was an

1843
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:36,670
important product years and years ago it

1844
01:17:30,039 --> 01:17:37,929
had been dried maybe in the Sun but it

1845
01:17:36,670 --> 01:17:41,079
would been processed

1846
01:17:37,929 --> 01:17:44,859
it'll be shipped really long visits so

1847
01:17:41,079 --> 01:17:48,939
it was no where near as terpene rich as

1848
01:17:44,859 --> 01:17:51,908
the varieties that we have now and when

1849
01:17:48,939 --> 01:17:54,969
you smoke a really rich Turkish variety

1850
01:17:51,908 --> 01:17:57,609
I mean there is no doubt as it's better

1851
01:17:54,969 --> 01:18:00,340
yeah no doubt

1852
01:17:57,609 --> 01:18:03,479
yeah in terms of hash you know I've

1853
01:18:00,340 --> 01:18:06,610
heard you say since numerous times that

1854
01:18:03,479 --> 01:18:09,009
terpenes can be washed away with water

1855
01:18:06,609 --> 01:18:12,368
are there specific varieties that you've

1856
01:18:09,010 --> 01:18:15,190
noticed that hold true to their terpene

1857
01:18:12,368 --> 01:18:17,859
profound more than others over the years

1858
01:18:15,189 --> 01:18:20,879
I would think Marcus knows better than

1859
01:18:17,859 --> 01:18:29,500
me but over here one of the ones that

1860
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:32,739
was known to do that was I forgot today

1861
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:35,800
but I'm sorry but Marcus and you know a

1862
01:18:32,738 --> 01:18:38,259
bunch of varieties that are that retain

1863
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:40,690
most of their terpenes with water

1864
01:18:38,260 --> 01:18:42,400
process there's definitely some and I'll

1865
01:18:40,689 --> 01:18:44,948
never forget the first one I ever came

1866
01:18:42,399 --> 01:18:48,908
across was the Rene which seemed to be

1867
01:18:44,948 --> 01:18:51,099
some type of like like often blueberry

1868
01:18:48,908 --> 01:18:53,679
and Renee were mistaken for one another

1869
01:18:51,100 --> 01:18:56,170
they it was very dense and it grew these

1870
01:18:53,679 --> 01:18:58,750
just incredible I mean I'm talking like

1871
01:18:56,170 --> 01:19:01,480
I'm not really even sure if I've ever

1872
01:18:58,750 --> 01:19:05,109
smelled a terpene profile stinkier than

1873
01:19:01,479 --> 01:19:07,988
the original Renee I mean it was it got

1874
01:19:05,109 --> 01:19:10,420
people kick what's that one of the ones

1875
01:19:07,988 --> 01:19:15,399
with that held up against water here I

1876
01:19:10,420 --> 01:19:17,920
remember that it was across Osetra yeah

1877
01:19:15,399 --> 01:19:24,299
yeah that one did have a nice lemony

1878
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:24,300
flavor it kept the smell after water

1879
01:19:24,750 --> 01:19:31,149
personal commotion smelled that yeah

1880
01:19:29,198 --> 01:19:32,678
that's again when it retains I mean I

1881
01:19:31,149 --> 01:19:35,289
have a list of ones that work really

1882
01:19:32,679 --> 01:19:37,060
well Sam I was just curious that if you

1883
01:19:35,289 --> 01:19:38,469
and your personal experience had had any

1884
01:19:37,060 --> 01:19:40,539
that where you're kind of your favorites

1885
01:19:38,469 --> 01:19:43,960
that's why I asked it but yeah I mean

1886
01:19:40,539 --> 01:19:45,789
there's a yeah there's a long list of

1887
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:51,760
how about that how about that one we

1888
01:19:45,789 --> 01:19:54,189
made in Jamaica that time what was

1889
01:19:51,760 --> 01:20:00,190
trippy about that of too was the color

1890
01:19:54,189 --> 01:20:03,819
the cottage oh yeah ready she ready

1891
01:20:00,189 --> 01:20:06,399
around oldish oh yeah no I remember it

1892
01:20:03,819 --> 01:20:13,059
I'll never forget that hassle but yes it

1893
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:16,809
had a different smell it smelled like it

1894
01:20:13,060 --> 01:20:21,310
wasn't you know raw marijuana or just

1895
01:20:16,810 --> 01:20:25,060
God yeah yeah no it wasn't it was a

1896
01:20:21,310 --> 01:20:26,800
contender let me tell ya it was a

1897
01:20:25,060 --> 01:20:29,140
contender it was so nice to have just a

1898
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:32,380
big ball of it to just be like in

1899
01:20:29,140 --> 01:20:35,320
Jamaica loving life with a big ball of

1900
01:20:32,380 --> 01:20:37,960
melt just like this is good this is good

1901
01:20:35,319 --> 01:20:41,019
it's nice about Jamaica is you can buy

1902
01:20:37,960 --> 01:20:43,840
you know a kilo weed for a hundred or

1903
01:20:41,020 --> 01:20:48,550
200 bucks or whatever and who cares you

1904
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:50,949
just grind it up and some water - yeah

1905
01:20:48,550 --> 01:20:52,900
yep that's I mean that's what I was

1906
01:20:50,948 --> 01:20:54,698
doing I was even happy to be honest once

1907
01:20:52,899 --> 01:20:56,738
I knew I was getting the quality that I

1908
01:20:54,698 --> 01:20:58,988
got with you that time I was happy to

1909
01:20:56,738 --> 01:21:02,259
pay 300 bucks it's like dude here's some

1910
01:20:58,988 --> 01:21:04,988
extra like you're doing a great job you

1911
01:21:02,260 --> 01:21:06,850
know I'd go visit his grow and he didn't

1912
01:21:04,988 --> 01:21:09,189
have one of the things I always had to

1913
01:21:06,850 --> 01:21:11,590
do in Jamaica in particular was ID I'd

1914
01:21:09,189 --> 01:21:14,169
go around the outer perimeters of the

1915
01:21:11,590 --> 01:21:16,900
property however big his property was

1916
01:21:14,170 --> 01:21:18,369
and if I because often they you know

1917
01:21:16,899 --> 01:21:20,409
they don't have any way of disposing

1918
01:21:18,369 --> 01:21:23,050
certain things and so if they were using

1919
01:21:20,409 --> 01:21:25,630
you know chemicals pesticides fungicides

1920
01:21:23,050 --> 01:21:27,699
all these nasty things on their plants

1921
01:21:25,630 --> 01:21:29,819
you could usually find the bottles

1922
01:21:27,698 --> 01:21:33,159
somewhere on the property and that

1923
01:21:29,819 --> 01:21:35,380
particular guy the doctor he never used

1924
01:21:33,159 --> 01:21:35,859
chemicals period he was hilarious

1925

actually

1926
01:21:35,859 --> 01:21:42,159
he thought the bugs were there to tell

1927
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:43,130
him what fruit was the safest to eat so

1928
01:21:42,159 --> 01:21:45,260
he was like he

1929
01:21:43,130 --> 01:21:47,449
pick a sugar cane and he'd be like see

1930
01:21:45,260 --> 01:21:49,760
the worm like this one he's like no

1931
01:21:47,449 --> 01:21:51,769
chemicals and then he'd cut the worm

1932
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:55,100
section out and like squeeze the cane

1933
01:21:51,770 --> 01:21:56,750
juice by hand into a little kibosh for

1934

1967
01:23:31,819 --> 01:23:35,889
[ __ ] Harry Potter wands of diamonds

1971
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:47,840
cart too of rot the past present and

1972
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:50,539
future of rosin because people are

1973
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:52,190
looking for that advanced tech yeah a

1974
01:23:50,539 --> 01:23:54,439
lot of people have been trying to reach

1975
01:23:52,189 --> 01:23:56,479
out to me and feel obviously you know

1976
01:23:54,439 --> 01:23:58,729
shout out to him for being the first

1977
01:23:56,479 --> 01:24:00,859
to kind of put that on the map so to

1978
01:23:58,729 --> 01:24:03,529
speak straight up do you know I'll never

1979
01:24:00,859 --> 01:24:06,439
forget the way when he first posted

1980
01:24:03,529 --> 01:24:08,238
those like just in a in a before he

1981
01:24:06,439 --> 01:24:12,079
broke them like there was a pile of them

1982
01:24:08,238 --> 01:24:13,789
yeah I was like what the [ __ ] is this I

1983
01:24:12,079 --> 01:24:14,930
was the exact same way I just couldn't

1984
01:24:13,789 --> 01:24:18,890
believe is like wait what's going on

1985
01:24:14,930 --> 01:24:21,079
here I love that about the cannabis

1986
01:24:18,890 --> 01:24:22,869
scene you know something can just happen

1987
01:24:21,079 --> 01:24:25,729
overnight where you're suddenly like

1988
01:24:22,869 --> 01:24:28,279
it's like okay and and you know what the

1989
01:24:25,729 --> 01:24:30,559
key has always been and I always say

1990
01:24:28,279 --> 01:24:32,899
this to people like the key is obviously

1991
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:35,330
to have the passion to want to do these

1992
01:24:32,899 --> 01:24:38,149
things but to have the material to do it

1993
01:24:35,329 --> 01:24:40,909
with if you you know that's how bubble

1994
01:24:38,149 --> 01:24:44,210
bags really took off because I was in

1995
01:24:40,909 --> 01:24:50,449
this very unique position and had access

1996
01:24:44,210 --> 01:24:53,359
to just a stupid amount of product to

1997
01:24:50,449 --> 01:24:55,309
make hash with it was insane it was like

1998
01:24:53,359 --> 01:24:56,960
to the point where you know even when

1999
01:24:55,310 --> 01:24:59,600
pot was still selling for like three

2000
01:24:56,960 --> 01:25:01,310
thousand dollars a pound my friends

2001
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:04,250
would come over with like two or three

2002
01:25:01,310 --> 01:25:07,310
pounds of like beautiful flower like

2003
01:25:04,250 --> 01:25:11,569
this isn't like you know early 2000 and

2004
01:25:07,310 --> 01:25:13,850
and just drop it into the 20 gallon bags

2005
01:25:11,569 --> 01:25:15,319
and and make a batch of water hash with

2006
01:25:13,850 --> 01:25:23,000
it and I was just like damn dude that

2007
01:25:15,319 --> 01:25:27,289
was like a like a $9,000 - chick grows

2008
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:29,449
on trees the sky said there's two kinds

2009
01:25:27,289 --> 01:25:32,119
of folks that deal with cannabis I love

2010
01:25:29,449 --> 01:25:35,750
this quote those who use four clips and

2011
01:25:32,119 --> 01:25:37,760
those who yeah that you know what that

2012
01:25:35,750 --> 01:25:46,069
joke should always be told with a sound

2013
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:47,750
effect in the background yeah and what

2014
01:25:46,069 --> 01:25:49,579
what quote was that from was that from

2015
01:25:47,750 --> 01:25:54,800
Howard Marks mr. nice or who did you say

2016
01:25:49,579 --> 01:25:56,988
said that no no some hippie dog friend

2017
01:25:54,800 --> 01:26:01,039
of mine oh really because Howard Marks

2018
01:25:56,988 --> 01:26:02,509
definitely has that in his book maybe it

2019
01:26:01,039 --> 01:26:04,069
was from your hippy dog friend I

2020
01:26:02,510 --> 01:26:08,409
wouldn't be surprised he's definitely

2021
01:26:04,069 --> 01:26:08,409
mentioning people that you knew I would

2022
01:26:09,300 --> 01:26:15,239
I figured you did I figured you did

2023
01:26:13,220 --> 01:26:19,770
what's that there and how are the

2024
01:26:15,239 --> 01:26:24,289
diamonds made oh here we go

2025
01:26:19,770 --> 01:26:24,290
[Laughter]

2026
01:26:24,859 --> 01:26:31,409
[ __ ] wands exactly I can't believe it

2027
01:26:28,729 --> 01:26:33,209
how do you do it buddy I mean it's

2028
01:26:31,409 --> 01:26:34,889
really it's really really basic I've

2029
01:26:33,210 --> 01:26:36,480
showed it online a little bit now I've

2030
01:26:34,890 --> 01:26:40,890
kind of released a tech to a certain

2031
01:26:36,479 --> 01:26:42,449
extent I mean I'm not sure how I'll feel

2032
01:26:40,890 --> 01:26:44,579
about that because he was the first one

2033
01:26:42,449 --> 01:26:46,710
it didn't really share probably corazon

2034
01:26:44,579 --> 01:26:48,600
specific reasons but I just got to the

2035
01:26:46,710 --> 01:26:50,640
point where it was such common sense to

2036
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:51,990
me when I realized that I was done that

2037
01:26:50,640 --> 01:26:54,930
I just felt like I needed to share with

2038
01:26:51,989 --> 01:26:58,079
people it's just it's a matter of

2039
01:26:54,930 --> 01:26:59,970
keeping the material malleable enough to

2040
01:26:58,079 --> 01:27:02,789
form it in the way that you want to

2041
01:26:59,970 --> 01:27:04,500
there's no trick there's no magic

2042
01:27:02,789 --> 01:27:07,260
there's no Hogwarts [ __ ] it's just

2043
01:27:04,500 --> 01:27:10,710
really basic hey did you share that just

2044
01:27:07,260 --> 01:27:13,380
on a story or in an actual post I think

2045
01:27:10,710 --> 01:27:16,439
I did a time lapse post or I did I did

2046
01:27:13,380 --> 01:27:19,980
an actual live story in which I said and

2047
01:27:16,439 --> 01:27:21,479
I am yeah I'm gonna be putting that on

2048
01:27:19,979 --> 01:27:22,949
YouTube here pretty soon I think I'm

2049
01:27:21,479 --> 01:27:27,329
gonna edit it and do it proper but uh

2050
01:27:22,949 --> 01:27:28,559
which one is it is it um I can't

2051
01:27:27,329 --> 01:27:32,609
remember to be honest we do have to go

2052
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:34,620
back but essentially it's just it's just

2053
01:27:32,609 --> 01:27:36,269
melting down you're a at a certain point

2054
01:27:34,619 --> 01:27:38,489
to where it's not completely 100%

2055
01:27:36,270 --> 01:27:40,310
carving because you got to get it to

2056
01:27:38,489 --> 01:27:43,079
that point to where it can liquefy and

2057
01:27:40,310 --> 01:27:46,140
go from that chalky consistency to the

2058
01:27:43,079 --> 01:27:48,029
liquid consistency and then form it

2059
01:27:46,140 --> 01:27:51,119
while it's cooling down but that's the

2060
01:27:48,029 --> 01:27:53,880
trick right you wait too long yeah it'll

2061
01:27:51,119 --> 01:27:55,319
just shatter all over the place you do

2062
01:27:53,880 --> 01:28:00,119
it too early it'll just stick all over

2063
01:27:55,319 --> 01:28:02,789
to everything so alright it's uh it

2064
01:28:00,119 --> 01:28:04,920
might be up in one of my one of my posts

2065
01:28:02,789 --> 01:28:07,380
on my feet might know I did a time-lapse

2066
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:10,680
of the melt itself but I'm I did a live

2067
01:28:07,380 --> 01:28:13,079
feed a couple weeks back I saw it it was

2068
01:28:10,680 --> 01:28:15,590
great I just can't find it on your thing

2069
01:28:13,079 --> 01:28:18,239
right now okay I'm not sure if I started

2070
01:28:15,590 --> 01:28:19,440
there's like high times baller jars

2071
01:28:18,239 --> 01:28:21,449
clear domes

2072
01:28:19,439 --> 01:28:23,039
yeah I might not have posted it on that

2073
01:28:21,449 --> 01:28:24,420
part I think

2074
01:28:23,039 --> 01:28:27,269
we get to my phone so I could eventually

2075
01:28:24,420 --> 01:28:28,770
put it up on YouTube oh yeah okay

2076
01:28:27,270 --> 01:28:30,930
because I would a screenshot it and

2077
01:28:28,770 --> 01:28:33,620
shown it but yeah it's pretty damn cool

2078
01:28:30,930 --> 01:28:37,200
I mean you could give them the the quick

2079
01:28:33,619 --> 01:28:38,760
breakdown yeah I mean it's pretty set I

2080
01:28:37,199 --> 01:28:40,679
mean I we talking about the whole

2081
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:42,600
separation process or just a diamond

2082
01:28:40,680 --> 01:28:47,340
part yeah I don't know do you do th see

2083
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:50,789
a separation D oh no I haven't but I'd

2084
01:28:47,340 --> 01:28:53,760
love to hear the whole process I should

2085
01:28:50,789 --> 01:28:56,760
teach you separate and the battles yeah

2086
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:58,320
if you want to share it brother yeah I

2087
01:28:56,760 --> 01:29:00,600
don't really mind at this point I mean

2088
01:28:58,319 --> 01:29:03,269
if you if everybody could look at my

2089
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:04,650
feet essentially I mean none of people

2090
01:29:03,270 --> 01:29:07,520
that I follow a lot of people are

2091
01:29:04,649 --> 01:29:09,960
starting to pick up on it so I think

2092
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:12,030
covert extracts up I think he's up in

2093
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:14,159
Michigan two people on the East Coast

2094
01:29:12,029 --> 01:29:15,509
and Southwest everywhere start

2095
01:29:14,159 --> 01:29:17,939
everybody's starting to slowly pick up

2096
01:29:15,510 --> 01:29:20,610
on the separation process it's nice to

2097
01:29:17,939 --> 01:29:21,239
see do you have a youtube channel under

2098
01:29:20,609 --> 01:29:25,170
the same name

2099
01:29:21,239 --> 01:29:26,279
yeah records rajim there's not much down

2100
01:29:25,170 --> 01:29:28,140
there right now but there are a few

2101
01:29:26,279 --> 01:29:30,000
videos mechanical separate your videos

2102
01:29:28,140 --> 01:29:31,680
will be coming up shortly and do you

2103
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:33,930
have a you have a youtube brother

2104
01:29:31,680 --> 01:29:36,900
yeah it's Rock'em Sock'em same thing

2105
01:29:33,930 --> 01:29:39,000
yeah cuz if you do a video I can help

2106
01:29:36,899 --> 01:29:41,639
you get a bunch of exposure by posting

2107
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:43,159
it and linking it to your account yeah

2108
01:29:41,640 --> 01:29:45,869
definitely I definitely wanna do a

2109
01:29:43,159 --> 01:29:47,340
proper time-lapse educational video and

2110
01:29:45,869 --> 01:29:51,779
not just something me [ __ ] off you

2111
01:29:47,340 --> 01:29:53,699
know totally be great essentially the

2112
01:29:51,779 --> 01:29:56,189
mechanical separation process is is

2113
01:29:53,699 --> 01:29:58,139
taking perfectly good rosin and

2114
01:29:56,189 --> 01:30:00,149
separating it into two two fractions I

2115
01:29:58,140 --> 01:30:01,710
mean it's it when it comes down to its

2116
01:30:00,149 --> 01:30:04,199
really a consistency thing and it look

2117
01:30:01,710 --> 01:30:07,159
thing that father is aside from that

2118
01:30:04,199 --> 01:30:11,880
people you give the you give a patient

2119
01:30:07,159 --> 01:30:15,840
more opportunity to adjust the dose of

2120
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:17,520
THC a or THC to its dirt profile so if

2121
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:19,890
they don't want it much turf so you can

2122
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:22,200
they can you not use as much of the turf

2123
01:30:19,890 --> 01:30:28,579
fraction or vice versa with the with the

2124
01:30:22,199 --> 01:30:31,590
THC a fraction what is absolutely GTA

2125
01:30:28,579 --> 01:30:33,769
yes its thta it hasn't converted over

2126
01:30:31,590 --> 01:30:33,770
yet

2127
01:30:36,409 --> 01:30:41,539
go ahead so getting the getting the

2128
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:43,789
you're basically taking rosin and

2129
01:30:41,539 --> 01:30:46,399
repressing it and getting TD out of it

2130
01:30:43,789 --> 01:30:49,310
and then terms sauce yeah so it depends

2131
01:30:46,399 --> 01:30:51,109
on the rosin itself so if you take a 10

2132
01:30:49,310 --> 01:30:53,380
gram slab of rosin and it looks like

2133
01:30:51,109 --> 01:30:57,349
it's kind of chattery and snap and pool

2134
01:30:53,380 --> 01:30:58,789
that work that would work so if it

2135
01:30:57,350 --> 01:31:00,860
doesn't butter up the buttering up

2136
01:30:58,789 --> 01:31:03,769
quote-unquote process is what you're

2137
01:31:00,859 --> 01:31:05,659
looking for if it doesn't do that that's

2138
01:31:03,770 --> 01:31:07,550
that's the conversion of the actual the8

2139
01:31:05,659 --> 01:31:09,710
crystallizing within the rosin under my

2140
01:31:07,550 --> 01:31:12,230
assumption so if it doesn't that doesn't

2141
01:31:09,710 --> 01:31:13,850
happen in iran's and stays snap or a

2142
01:31:12,229 --> 01:31:16,569
shatter ii consistency it won't ever

2143
01:31:13,850 --> 01:31:17,860
crash quote-unquote or or separate

2144
01:31:16,569 --> 01:31:23,389
correct

2145
01:31:17,859 --> 01:31:26,899
so has to better content for it to

2146
01:31:23,390 --> 01:31:31,520
actually get to that stage spot and

2147
01:31:26,899 --> 01:31:34,299
repress it then right yep you have to

2148
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:37,130
use like a 25 micron or smaller screen

2149
01:31:34,300 --> 01:31:39,590
only the main reason is to hold back

2150
01:31:37,130 --> 01:31:42,109
that curricula crystallization form of

2151
01:31:39,590 --> 01:31:48,470
THC a in the bag and allow the turfs to

2152
01:31:42,109 --> 01:31:58,039
flow out serious knowledge being dropped

2153
01:31:48,470 --> 01:31:59,930
on the on the I've been doing this the

2154
01:31:58,039 --> 01:32:02,840
fractions are what what's allows you to

2155
01:31:59,930 --> 01:32:05,060
really get really artful with it and I

2156
01:32:02,840 --> 01:32:08,329
think that's that's the exciting part

2157
01:32:05,060 --> 01:32:09,560
about it and you know I just checked out

2158
01:32:08,329 --> 01:32:13,819
your Instagram what you're doing there

2159
01:32:09,560 --> 01:32:16,670
Rackham's is amazing so you get it there

2160
01:32:13,819 --> 01:32:19,219
and you get the wrapping the rosin in a

2161
01:32:16,670 --> 01:32:22,239
like 25 micron or smaller screen and

2162
01:32:19,220 --> 01:32:25,579
then doing this super light low temp

2163
01:32:22,239 --> 01:32:29,029
press yep yeah they call it like a purse

2164
01:32:25,579 --> 01:32:30,260
percy profess I've heard that used yeah

2165
01:32:29,029 --> 01:32:32,809
you essentially want to you want to

2166
01:32:30,260 --> 01:32:34,100
bring the plate down like a hand pump

2167
01:32:32,810 --> 01:32:37,070
would be ideal because you can actually

2168
01:32:34,100 --> 01:32:38,420
control you know the pressure of it the

2169
01:32:37,069 --> 01:32:40,309
body people obviously have pneumatics

2170
01:32:38,420 --> 01:32:41,350
and whatnot but I use a hand pump always

2171
01:32:40,310 --> 01:32:43,460
have and always will

2172
01:32:41,350 --> 01:32:45,500
it's just I'd like to feel the pressure

2173
01:32:43,460 --> 01:32:46,880
but when you're initially starting your

2174
01:32:45,500 --> 01:32:48,649
process you want to have your plates

2175
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:50,840
anywhere between like

2176
01:32:48,649 --> 01:32:54,289
a hundred degrees Fahrenheit or possibly

2177
01:32:50,840 --> 01:32:57,199
lower depending on how how biscuits the

2178
01:32:54,289 --> 01:32:59,840
rosin is if it's more like a crumbly one

2179
01:32:57,199 --> 01:33:01,279
X yeah you can bump up to eat a little

2180
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:04,400
bit higher but I usually start around

2181
01:33:01,279 --> 01:33:08,719
100 100 Fahrenheit or around what's that

2182
01:33:04,399 --> 01:33:12,859
40-ish forty three Celsius I started

2183
01:33:08,720 --> 01:33:16,820
them there sorry when you said when he

2184
01:33:12,859 --> 01:33:21,439
said this go ahead you the terpene

2185
01:33:16,819 --> 01:33:25,969
profiles of the campus or the resin and

2186
01:33:21,439 --> 01:33:29,139
then after you've made rosin analyzed it

2187
01:33:25,970 --> 01:33:32,420
I'm wondering are the ratios of

2188
01:33:29,140 --> 01:33:34,190
monoterpenes changing do you know they

2189
01:33:32,420 --> 01:33:35,779
possibly are I haven't had testing to

2190
01:33:34,189 --> 01:33:37,879
confirm that so I don't quote me on that

2191
01:33:35,779 --> 01:33:39,500
but they very well possibly are because

2192
01:33:37,880 --> 01:33:42,350
you're rejecting heat back into that's

2193
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:44,869
this whole process so Sam they they have

2194
01:33:42,350 --> 01:33:47,750
to be they have to be changing based on

2195
01:33:44,869 --> 01:33:55,869
on the just on science you know I mean

2196
01:33:47,750 --> 01:33:58,939
monitor all have a different yeah yeah

2197
01:33:55,869 --> 01:34:01,069
how long do you press that for on the

2198
01:33:58,939 --> 01:34:02,750
low temp with the hand pressed so now

2199
01:34:01,069 --> 01:34:05,179
here's the thing it all depends

2200
01:34:02,750 --> 01:34:07,880
obviously and within the solving this

2201
01:34:05,180 --> 01:34:11,210
game we have very very many variables we

2202
01:34:07,880 --> 01:34:13,130
all know that with with this process it

2203
01:34:11,210 --> 01:34:14,750
depends on how much you're pressing if

2204
01:34:13,130 --> 01:34:17,659
you're just pressing a couple of grams I

2205
01:34:14,750 --> 01:34:21,050
mean the first press could easily allow

2206
01:34:17,659 --> 01:34:23,630
you to be done within 40 45 minutes but

2207
01:34:21,050 --> 01:34:26,720
if you're pressing mean a half zip or an

2208
01:34:23,630 --> 01:34:29,060
ounce or or more that's gonna take you

2209
01:34:26,720 --> 01:34:31,369
quite some time to get all that Terp

2210
01:34:29,060 --> 01:34:33,650
fraction slowly removed from the process

2211
01:34:31,369 --> 01:34:35,029
of my process I'm usually doing about a

2212
01:34:33,649 --> 01:34:37,579
half ounce or more

2213
01:34:35,029 --> 01:34:39,739
I used my initial press can be anywhere

2214
01:34:37,579 --> 01:34:44,239
from an hour to 90 minutes at around 80

2215
01:34:39,739 --> 01:34:46,519
200 degrees Fahrenheit Wow yeah that's

2216
01:34:44,239 --> 01:34:48,619
just the first press and I base that off

2217
01:34:46,520 --> 01:34:51,020
of once again fill and other people that

2218
01:34:48,619 --> 01:34:52,609
I've seen that have made comments along

2219
01:34:51,020 --> 01:34:54,800
the way you know through the brush

2220
01:34:52,609 --> 01:34:57,079
progression of this whole process saying

2221
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:58,940
that yeah my first press is at 90

2222
01:34:57,079 --> 01:35:00,319
minutes you know for such-and-such

2223
01:34:58,939 --> 01:35:02,269
temperature that I did the exact same

2224
01:35:00,319 --> 01:35:06,829
reactions like are you [ __ ] me

2225
01:35:02,270 --> 01:35:08,750
it's just like your your are you timing

2226
01:35:06,829 --> 01:35:10,789
it along the way where you give it a

2227
01:35:08,750 --> 01:35:14,810
press like oh yeah if you had this and

2228
01:35:10,789 --> 01:35:20,149
so so deed do so how what's your space

2229
01:35:14,810 --> 01:35:21,770
between your press press yeah so

2230
01:35:20,149 --> 01:35:23,719
initially what I do is I bring the plate

2231
01:35:21,770 --> 01:35:25,190
the top plate down to the bag and the

2232
01:35:23,720 --> 01:35:28,579
parchment and just make it so it's snug

2233
01:35:25,189 --> 01:35:30,409
just no really absolutely no pressure

2234
01:35:28,579 --> 01:35:32,390
just enough to hold the bag there and

2235
01:35:30,409 --> 01:35:34,340
start the start the crystallization

2236
01:35:32,390 --> 01:35:35,990
process or speed it up so to speak

2237
01:35:34,340 --> 01:35:38,180
because that's what's really happening

2238
01:35:35,989 --> 01:35:39,469
when your rosin sputtering in itself so

2239
01:35:38,180 --> 01:35:41,930
essentially you're putting it in the

2240
01:35:39,470 --> 01:35:44,869
press to force this to happen a lot

2241
01:35:41,930 --> 01:35:46,700
sooner just like a lot of people with

2242
01:35:44,869 --> 01:35:47,720
the new jar tech it's pretty much what

2243
01:35:46,699 --> 01:35:49,819
they're doing they're causing their

2244
01:35:47,720 --> 01:35:51,260
rosin the crash in a different way a lot

2245
01:35:49,819 --> 01:35:55,639
sooner than it would have normally just

2246
01:35:51,260 --> 01:35:58,190
sitting out but the first press is

2247
01:35:55,640 --> 01:35:59,960
usually around like I'll start it and

2248
01:35:58,189 --> 01:36:03,500
then around 20 minutes to a half-hour

2249
01:35:59,960 --> 01:36:04,730
I'll at least nowadays I've been bumping

2250
01:36:03,500 --> 01:36:07,189
up the printer a little bit obviously

2251
01:36:04,729 --> 01:36:08,239
starts it's starting to flow things are

2252
01:36:07,189 --> 01:36:09,679
starting to change they're starting to

2253
01:36:08,239 --> 01:36:11,689
sweat and it's what I like to call it

2254
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:14,030
I'll bring the pressure down a little

2255
01:36:11,689 --> 01:36:15,710
bit up a little bit not much but like a

2256
01:36:14,029 --> 01:36:17,029
half a pump or so just to kind of keep

2257
01:36:15,710 --> 01:36:19,460
it moving

2258
01:36:17,029 --> 01:36:21,649
and then I'll bump up the temperature

2259
01:36:19,460 --> 01:36:24,980
about every half hour to 45 minutes I'll

2260
01:36:21,649 --> 01:36:26,689
bump it up a few to two degrees and this

2261
01:36:24,979 --> 01:36:29,419
is though so once again the slow process

2262
01:36:26,689 --> 01:36:31,369
for like if you have a rosin consistency

2263
01:36:29,420 --> 01:36:34,100
initially starting out that's kind of

2264
01:36:31,369 --> 01:36:36,949
like more of a sugary butter that's more

2265
01:36:34,100 --> 01:36:39,860
malleable and not so crumbly like a wax

2266
01:36:36,949 --> 01:36:41,929
consistency if it's it's kind of like a

2267
01:36:39,859 --> 01:36:44,869
thick peanut butter but still has those

2268
01:36:41,930 --> 01:36:46,190
crystal like sugar consistency inside

2269
01:36:44,869 --> 01:36:48,500
the rosin that'll work but it's gonna

2270
01:36:46,189 --> 01:36:51,469
take a lot longer because that's gonna

2271
01:36:48,500 --> 01:36:54,140
want to be forced out of the bag which

2272
01:36:51,470 --> 01:36:57,680
what you'll cause issues in the long run

2273
01:36:54,140 --> 01:37:00,140
for your terp fraction yeah the endgame

2274
01:36:57,680 --> 01:37:02,450
here is to pretty much hold back that

2275
01:37:00,140 --> 01:37:04,730
single connect cannabinoid in the bag as

2276
01:37:02,449 --> 01:37:09,289
long as possible and allow everything

2277
01:37:04,729 --> 01:37:12,259
else to flow out and before I was using

2278
01:37:09,289 --> 01:37:14,810
multiple presses I was using a not

2279
01:37:12,260 --> 01:37:16,130
multiple presses but I was I was doing

2280
01:37:14,810 --> 01:37:18,440
multiple presses

2281
01:37:16,130 --> 01:37:20,420
with multiple wraps and things like that

2282
01:37:18,439 --> 01:37:23,059
but now I've come to find out that I

2283
01:37:20,420 --> 01:37:25,909
just leave it wrapped in my single or

2284
01:37:23,060 --> 01:37:28,700
double wrapped of 25 micron or smaller

2285
01:37:25,909 --> 01:37:30,109
for the whole time period some of my

2286
01:37:28,699 --> 01:37:37,399
presses last six to seven hours

2287
01:37:30,109 --> 01:37:39,380
depending on what I do initial point you

2288
01:37:37,399 --> 01:37:40,909
want like very little pressure and you

2289
01:37:39,380 --> 01:37:43,220
ramp up everything just like if you're

2290
01:37:40,909 --> 01:37:45,619
pressing rosin like normal but you're

2291
01:37:43,220 --> 01:37:47,659
this repress process you want low

2292
01:37:45,619 --> 01:37:49,909
pressure low heat and gradually ramp up

2293
01:37:47,659 --> 01:37:52,130
over the course of obviously a couple

2294
01:37:49,909 --> 01:37:55,789
hours if you're pressing more than a

2295
01:37:52,130 --> 01:38:07,810
half step or an ounce perfect with low

2296
01:37:55,789 --> 01:38:07,810
pressure low heat long material

2297
01:38:08,319 --> 01:38:14,389
definitely in this process from my

2298
01:38:10,760 --> 01:38:17,239
experience I mean I've done mostly dry

2299
01:38:14,390 --> 01:38:20,000
cured Budd hatch rosin so to speak but I

2300
01:38:17,239 --> 01:38:22,550
have done live rosin my recent post if

2301
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:24,140
you look at my diamond formations

2302
01:38:22,550 --> 01:38:26,539
they're all from made from whole plant

2303
01:38:24,140 --> 01:38:30,530
fresh frozen live rasa the turf the turf

2304
01:38:26,539 --> 01:38:32,239
profile is definitely a lot more in your

2305
01:38:30,529 --> 01:38:33,920
nose so to speak with live rosin

2306
01:38:32,239 --> 01:38:36,439
compared to hash rosin but that's

2307
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:38,989
obviously because of the cure point

2308
01:38:36,439 --> 01:38:43,579
there the cure factor there there not

2309
01:38:38,989 --> 01:38:48,319
being one market my favorite rosin some

2310
01:38:43,579 --> 01:38:54,350
of them have been made from dry suited

2311
01:38:48,319 --> 01:38:57,199
or water sifted heads my eye I'm

2312
01:38:54,350 --> 01:39:00,320
wondering is there a way to completely

2313
01:38:57,199 --> 01:39:03,199
knocked off all of the resin from a

2314
01:39:00,319 --> 01:39:05,929
fresh plant that's frozen or something

2315
01:39:03,199 --> 01:39:08,960
but this I mean I've heard about you

2316
01:39:05,930 --> 01:39:11,329
know the nitrogen tech where but that

2317
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:15,020
grinds up every it Cober eyes is

2318
01:39:11,329 --> 01:39:17,720
everything not only the the resin and

2319
01:39:15,020 --> 01:39:20,600
I'm trying to keep the the resin head

2320
01:39:17,720 --> 01:39:21,490
intact but liberated from the frozen

2321
01:39:20,600 --> 01:39:25,239
mask

2322
01:39:21,489 --> 01:39:27,909
I'm just they kind of thrown away

2323
01:39:25,238 --> 01:39:30,669
yeah I haven't seen anything that

2324
01:39:27,909 --> 01:39:33,219
extracts in pure form and the problem

2325
01:39:30,670 --> 01:39:35,770
with getting a contaminated product with

2326
01:39:33,219 --> 01:39:39,100
like a dry ice or a nitrogen is that you

2327
01:39:35,770 --> 01:39:41,410
end up with this contaminated very fresh

2328
01:39:39,100 --> 01:39:43,660
sort of you know head that's willing to

2329
01:39:41,409 --> 01:39:46,029
butter you know the head has got

2330
01:39:43,659 --> 01:39:48,369
moisture in the wax membrane it has not

2331
01:39:46,029 --> 01:39:49,840
been dried and cured and and therefore

2332
01:39:48,369 --> 01:39:50,800
you would really need to figure out a

2333
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:52,779
way quickly

2334
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:54,969
I guess maybe right into a freeze dryer

2335
01:39:52,779 --> 01:39:56,738
and then you know once all the moistures

2336
01:39:54,969 --> 01:40:00,100
removed from it you could potentially do

2337
01:39:56,738 --> 01:40:03,218
a variety of things but that's seemingly

2338
01:40:00,100 --> 01:40:04,660
creating a lot of stages - that has been

2339
01:40:03,219 --> 01:40:06,100
a new thing that people have been doing

2340
01:40:04,659 --> 01:40:08,949
people have been putting their their

2341
01:40:06,100 --> 01:40:12,370
fresh not fresh frozen but fresh uncured

2342
01:40:08,949 --> 01:40:14,439
bud buck down into freeze dryers and

2343
01:40:12,369 --> 01:40:16,059
freeze drying it yeah and they're

2344
01:40:14,439 --> 01:40:18,969
smoking it right out right out of the

2345
01:40:16,060 --> 01:40:21,160
freeze dryer like instantly and they

2346
01:40:18,969 --> 01:40:23,020
said it's some of the most amazing smoke

2347
01:40:21,159 --> 01:40:26,949
they've done now I've been curious about

2348
01:40:23,020 --> 01:40:28,780
washing freeze-dried bud I have yet to

2349
01:40:26,949 --> 01:40:31,779
try it but I'm gonna probably experiment

2350
01:40:28,779 --> 01:40:33,340
so you know I think this is really cool

2351
01:40:31,779 --> 01:40:35,259
that what you're sharing but also the

2352
01:40:33,340 --> 01:40:36,579
conversation because you know since

2353
01:40:35,260 --> 01:40:40,030
you've been talking there's been at

2354
01:40:36,579 --> 01:40:43,869
least three or four people just kind of

2355
01:40:40,029 --> 01:40:45,369
like in the chat room who just it's kind

2356
01:40:43,869 --> 01:40:47,550
of like their [ __ ] doesn't stink is how

2357
01:40:45,369 --> 01:40:50,769
they're acting and just mocking the Oh

2358
01:40:47,550 --> 01:40:52,119
600 kind of like that and in the

2359
01:40:50,770 --> 01:40:53,800
meantime it's like you know it's people

2360
01:40:52,119 --> 01:40:55,149
like yourself and soil grown and people

2361
01:40:53,800 --> 01:40:56,590
who are willing to experiment and play

2362
01:40:55,149 --> 01:40:58,689
around that will make the next great

2363
01:40:56,590 --> 01:41:01,989
discoveries that these same

2364
01:40:58,689 --> 01:41:03,819
[ __ ] will be enjoying in six

2365
01:41:01,988 --> 01:41:05,559
months from now so it's just funny to

2366
01:41:03,819 --> 01:41:07,809
see how it plays out where you get

2367
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:10,750
people like just kind of mocking

2368
01:41:07,810 --> 01:41:13,000
belittling talking down I'm just it's

2369
01:41:10,750 --> 01:41:14,199
just it's just it's gonna happen let's

2370
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,789
understand the point that like

2371
01:41:14,199 --> 01:41:17,559
everything that I'm speaking here isn't

2372
01:41:15,789 --> 01:41:19,029
isn't law you know this is just

2373
01:41:17,560 --> 01:41:22,600
something that I've learned along the

2374
01:41:19,029 --> 01:41:25,210
way that works for me I'm not trying to

2375
01:41:22,600 --> 01:41:26,710
preach this as as like scripture or

2376
01:41:25,210 --> 01:41:29,649
anything like that if something if you

2377
01:41:26,710 --> 01:41:31,659
can alter what I present to you in a

2378
01:41:29,649 --> 01:41:34,149
better form in a faster form more power

2379
01:41:31,659 --> 01:41:36,130
and people have done net-like covert for

2380
01:41:34,149 --> 01:41:38,319
example you look up covert extracts he

2381
01:41:36,130 --> 01:41:40,900
was able to get his

2382
01:41:38,319 --> 01:41:42,939
I think converted over in less than an

2383
01:41:40,899 --> 01:41:43,420
hour and it's it's it's clearer than

2384
01:41:42,939 --> 01:41:45,969
mine

2385
01:41:43,420 --> 01:41:46,960
so he's extracting mortar no more turf

2386
01:41:45,970 --> 01:41:49,300
than than I am

2387
01:41:46,960 --> 01:41:50,680
and he hasn't shared his tech which I

2388
01:41:49,300 --> 01:41:52,960
don't blame him for to certain extent

2389
01:41:50,680 --> 01:41:53,860
but everything that I've learned up

2390
01:41:52,960 --> 01:41:56,739
until this point

2391
01:41:53,859 --> 01:41:58,960
nobody's told me I'm doing wrong so if

2392
01:41:56,739 --> 01:42:00,250
it seems to help somebody else I'm I'm

2393
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:02,350
just gonna keep sharing it the way that

2394
01:42:00,250 --> 01:42:04,329
I've been so people need to understand

2395
01:42:02,350 --> 01:42:10,390
that this isn't like the be-all end-all

2396
01:42:04,329 --> 01:42:12,760
way that I really love about the

2397
01:42:10,390 --> 01:42:15,520
industry is that every time something

2398
01:42:12,760 --> 01:42:18,760
news is introduced

2399
01:42:15,520 --> 01:42:21,460
there's always sit back and I think

2400
01:42:18,760 --> 01:42:23,020
what's next because there's always

2401
01:42:21,460 --> 01:42:26,109
something next it was the you know the

2402
01:42:23,020 --> 01:42:28,510
the pure dry sift and then and then the

2403
01:42:26,109 --> 01:42:31,630
the rosin and stuff like that and now

2404
01:42:28,510 --> 01:42:35,560
this part of it and six seven hours I'm

2405
01:42:31,630 --> 01:42:40,739
like I'm thinking to myself it's a long

2406
01:42:35,560 --> 01:42:48,010
time when there was no water sit fashion

2407
01:42:40,739 --> 01:42:50,079
yes that was a big one both both BHO and

2408
01:42:48,010 --> 01:42:52,690
water hash were made public to one

2409
01:42:50,079 --> 01:42:54,430
another well I'm sure on a lower level

2410
01:42:52,689 --> 01:42:57,309
they were both made public to people

2411
01:42:54,430 --> 01:43:01,450
throughout in a very small way but how

2412
01:42:57,310 --> 01:43:03,130
in 1999 is when if I released water hash

2413
01:43:01,449 --> 01:43:05,739
like to the masses and it already

2414
01:43:03,130 --> 01:43:07,840
existed on a smaller level but started

2415
01:43:05,739 --> 01:43:09,579
getting it out posting it on over

2416
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:11,710
growing cannabis culture and cannabis

2417
01:43:09,579 --> 01:43:13,989
world and all of these different forums

2418
01:43:11,710 --> 01:43:16,569
and then the butane came along in the

2419
01:43:13,989 --> 01:43:18,159
same way and it just spread like

2420
01:43:16,569 --> 01:43:20,109
wildfire and I'm telling you I I

2421
01:43:18,159 --> 01:43:22,510
remember being around during that time

2422
01:43:20,109 --> 01:43:26,170
where you know not a lot of people had

2423
01:43:22,510 --> 01:43:29,590
good hash in 96 97 98 but I'll tell you

2424
01:43:26,170 --> 01:43:31,329
99 2000 2001 it was happening more and

2425
01:43:29,590 --> 01:43:34,090
more and more and it's it's been

2426
01:43:31,329 --> 01:43:36,010
happening consistently since then more

2427
01:43:34,090 --> 01:43:37,659
and more and more like some people that

2428
01:43:36,010 --> 01:43:39,430
are new to this have come in at a high

2429
01:43:37,659 --> 01:43:42,430
level of the industry but don't

2430
01:43:39,430 --> 01:43:45,850
understand how only 20 or so years ago

2431
01:43:42,430 --> 01:43:48,369
there was so many less people actually

2432
01:43:45,850 --> 01:43:50,770
playing around and making hash and it

2433
01:43:48,369 --> 01:43:51,529
was in that experimenting and in that

2434
01:43:50,770 --> 01:43:53,929
you

2435
01:43:51,529 --> 01:43:55,578
no experience of like having material to

2436
01:43:53,929 --> 01:43:57,828
play with and make cash and make dry

2437
01:43:55,578 --> 01:43:59,689
sift and create water hash and learn new

2438
01:43:57,828 --> 01:44:02,389
ways to dry it and press it wet and make

2439
01:43:59,689 --> 01:44:04,368
mistakes all of those mistakes led us to

2440
01:44:02,389 --> 01:44:06,260
where we are today so when you think

2441
01:44:04,368 --> 01:44:08,299
someone's doing something stupid with

2442
01:44:06,260 --> 01:44:11,059
cannabis and you think they're making a

2443
01:44:08,300 --> 01:44:14,239
big mistake you would do best to thank

2444
01:44:11,059 --> 01:44:18,590
them instead of mock them my two cents

2445
01:44:14,238 --> 01:44:20,750
and I just wanted to tell you thank you

2446
01:44:18,590 --> 01:44:24,260
for sure and are sharing that with us as

2447
01:44:20,750 --> 01:44:26,090
well awesome yeah from my perspective

2448
01:44:24,260 --> 01:44:28,909
guys it's kind of like music you know

2449
01:44:26,090 --> 01:44:30,770
music is very fluid and if you bring a

2450
01:44:28,908 --> 01:44:33,170
rigidness to that just like you bring a

2451
01:44:30,770 --> 01:44:35,690
rigidness to science and exploration

2452
01:44:33,170 --> 01:44:37,460
you're just you're just gonna be bitter

2453
01:44:35,689 --> 01:44:39,729
all the time and it's just there's

2454
01:44:37,460 --> 01:44:42,078
wonderful things out there embrace it

2455
01:44:39,729 --> 01:44:44,089
yeah I mean that's the reason that I

2456
01:44:42,078 --> 01:44:45,979
kind of continued with doing this this

2457
01:44:44,090 --> 01:44:47,449
mechanical separation process initially

2458
01:44:45,979 --> 01:44:48,948
I was like a lot of other people like

2459
01:44:47,448 --> 01:44:51,408
really what the [ __ ] the point of this

2460
01:44:48,948 --> 01:44:53,328
like you're ruining pretty rockin but

2461
01:44:51,408 --> 01:44:55,819
then I realized that one there's a

2462
01:44:53,328 --> 01:44:57,469
demand for it people wanted it and then

2463
01:44:55,819 --> 01:44:59,090
two it was started to become really

2464
01:44:57,469 --> 01:45:01,908
intriguing just the whole process behind

2465
01:44:59,090 --> 01:45:03,319
it and I felt like I was just thinking

2466
01:45:01,908 --> 01:45:05,000
in my brain how can I refine this

2467
01:45:03,319 --> 01:45:07,519
process even more like how far can we

2468
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:09,109
take this that's mainly what my and my

2469
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:14,449
main goal was to see how far I could

2470
01:45:09,109 --> 01:45:17,750
take it and I don't know further we can

2471
01:45:14,448 --> 01:45:20,448
take like once you separate the THC a

2472
01:45:17,750 --> 01:45:22,368
from from the cannabinoids I mean how

2473
01:45:20,448 --> 01:45:24,049
far how much farther can you take it

2474
01:45:22,368 --> 01:45:25,339
another question is is can you separate

2475
01:45:24,050 --> 01:45:27,020
other cannabinoids at certain

2476
01:45:25,340 --> 01:45:28,599
temperatures that's my next experiment

2477
01:45:27,020 --> 01:45:30,980
yeah absolutely

2478
01:45:28,599 --> 01:45:34,159
that's exactly what I'm saying like keep

2479
01:45:30,979 --> 01:45:36,439
going because honestly you know it's

2480
01:45:34,158 --> 01:45:38,868
it's about that exploration that's gonna

2481
01:45:36,439 --> 01:45:40,549
find you in that in that place that

2482
01:45:38,868 --> 01:45:44,868
you're standing alone and you're gonna

2483
01:45:40,550 --> 01:45:48,559
be like holy oh my God look at this who

2484
01:45:44,868 --> 01:45:52,098
has smoked all of the major cannabinoids

2485
01:45:48,559 --> 01:45:55,630
and all of the major Kirkuk tell you

2486
01:45:52,099 --> 01:45:59,420
what you want for recreational purposes

2487
01:45:55,630 --> 01:46:02,529
Medical is much much broader good for

2488
01:45:59,420 --> 01:46:03,880
recreational purposes you want the right

2489
01:46:02,529 --> 01:46:08,559
combination

2490
01:46:03,880 --> 01:46:11,760
terpenes that affects the way you want

2491
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:14,170
the modulation and potentiation and

2492
01:46:11,760 --> 01:46:16,150
that's why I like doing the separation

2493
01:46:14,170 --> 01:46:18,190
because you can you can change the the

2494
01:46:16,149 --> 01:46:20,559
actual percentage or quote-unquote the

2495
01:46:18,189 --> 01:46:28,329
amount of terpene that you want to

2496
01:46:20,560 --> 01:46:34,030
introduce into your quote unquote but

2497
01:46:28,329 --> 01:46:38,079
yes you can do that and yeah I mean THC

2498
01:46:34,029 --> 01:46:39,759
or ta-ta if you're gonna smoke it I'm

2499
01:46:38,079 --> 01:46:44,710
not sure there's so much different

2500
01:46:39,760 --> 01:46:52,690
because dat a just converted to THC by

2501
01:46:44,710 --> 01:46:55,179
the act of its THC and the turkey yes

2502
01:46:52,689 --> 01:46:57,729
well I will be honest I did see it all

2503
01:46:55,179 --> 01:47:01,480
you had all those major cannabinoids you

2504
01:46:57,729 --> 01:47:05,619
had like CBG and you had CB and and you

2505
01:47:01,479 --> 01:47:07,599
had THC a and you had you had like 10 of

2506
01:47:05,619 --> 01:47:10,510
them or something in little jars and you

2507
01:47:07,600 --> 01:47:13,409
had terpenes as well and that was crazy

2508
01:47:10,510 --> 01:47:15,760
for me because that was like 2000 2001

2509
01:47:13,408 --> 01:47:17,559
and I was like and I've never seen

2510
01:47:15,760 --> 01:47:20,560
anything like that I was really just

2511
01:47:17,560 --> 01:47:22,239
like just started extracting heads with

2512
01:47:20,560 --> 01:47:24,370
water and ice I was feeling pretty good

2513
01:47:22,238 --> 01:47:27,968
about that then I'm like over at Sam's

2514
01:47:24,369 --> 01:47:30,729
place going damn like [ __ ] the rabbit

2515
01:47:27,969 --> 01:47:33,340
hole goes way deeper than I thought like

2516
01:47:30,729 --> 01:47:36,069
this is some [ __ ] crazy [ __ ] like I

2517
01:47:33,340 --> 01:47:37,480
started on this little rock and then I

2518
01:47:36,069 --> 01:47:39,130
jumped off I was like oh that's a big

2519
01:47:37,479 --> 01:47:40,959
jump and then Sam was like here jump

2520
01:47:39,130 --> 01:47:51,489
with me and we jumped into the Grand

2521
01:47:40,960 --> 01:47:53,649
Canyon now the to get the rosin that

2522
01:47:51,488 --> 01:47:54,359
you're gonna be repressing for that

2523
01:47:53,649 --> 01:47:59,379
length of time

2524
01:47:54,359 --> 01:48:01,750
what do you press flower live live fresh

2525
01:47:59,380 --> 01:48:04,239
frozen bubble hash or a cured bubble

2526
01:48:01,750 --> 01:48:06,369
hash and what did you what do you do

2527
01:48:04,238 --> 01:48:09,519
with that is it a long low temp press as

2528
01:48:06,369 --> 01:48:11,619
well so you get the butter out or what's

2529
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:13,750
your process with that to make that the

2530
01:48:11,619 --> 01:48:16,658
the rosin you're going to be separating

2531
01:48:13,750 --> 01:48:17,679
on the next press so are you talking

2532
01:48:16,658 --> 01:48:20,018
about the initial rosin

2533
01:48:17,679 --> 01:48:22,899
and the type of rosin night we're gonna

2534
01:48:20,019 --> 01:48:25,748
be repressing yes and the starting

2535
01:48:22,899 --> 01:48:28,238
material you use your choices yes so I

2536
01:48:25,748 --> 01:48:30,279
mean as far as compared to I've had this

2537
01:48:28,238 --> 01:48:33,279
question a lot so flour rosin dry stiff

2538
01:48:30,279 --> 01:48:35,889
frozen hash rosin live whole plant fresh

2539
01:48:33,279 --> 01:48:39,639
frozen rosin doesn't matter as long as

2540
01:48:35,889 --> 01:48:42,159
it butters up I tend to let my rosin

2541
01:48:39,639 --> 01:48:44,019
butter up on its own a lot of people

2542
01:48:42,158 --> 01:48:45,788
will see me do that taffy Tech [ __ ]

2543
01:48:44,019 --> 01:48:48,849
like kind of a whipping it and pulling

2544
01:48:45,788 --> 01:48:51,130
it all that is is to bring my rosin

2545
01:48:48,849 --> 01:48:53,679
straight off the press into the same

2546
01:48:51,130 --> 01:48:55,779
consistency or one even consistency and

2547
01:48:53,679 --> 01:48:57,998
then I allow it to sit a lot of people

2548
01:48:55,779 --> 01:48:59,248
are calling that cold cure now which is

2549
01:48:57,998 --> 01:49:03,908
just leaving it at a room temperature

2550
01:48:59,248 --> 01:49:06,819
cure with parchment tp'ed over it I

2551
01:49:03,908 --> 01:49:08,348
allowed to do its own thing and convert

2552
01:49:06,819 --> 01:49:10,478
because then I know it's going to work

2553
01:49:08,349 --> 01:49:12,849
properly in the press for the repress

2554
01:49:10,479 --> 01:49:16,199
process if it doesn't convert on its own

2555
01:49:12,849 --> 01:49:18,939
stage battery and and clear so to speak

2556
01:49:16,198 --> 01:49:27,188
then it won't work and that's kind of

2557
01:49:18,939 --> 01:49:30,670
how I gauge it also another when you

2558
01:49:27,189 --> 01:49:33,159
made it frozen you made it dry cept

2559
01:49:30,670 --> 01:49:37,300
you've made it from the bud you've made

2560
01:49:33,158 --> 01:49:39,819
it from from the resin Waterson or

2561
01:49:37,300 --> 01:49:42,219
whatever so that you can try to

2562
01:49:39,819 --> 01:49:45,429
eliminate some of the variables and

2563
01:49:42,219 --> 01:49:48,760
understand more with in other words is

2564
01:49:45,429 --> 01:49:52,719
there a specific process or is it all up

2565
01:49:48,760 --> 01:49:55,150
to the variety but why some butters I

2566
01:49:52,719 --> 01:49:57,189
think it's all based on the THC a

2567
01:49:55,149 --> 01:49:58,958
percentage or THC a content whether

2568
01:49:57,189 --> 01:50:00,550
that's in the flower or the rosin

2569
01:49:58,958 --> 01:50:02,889
however you want to put it it's all

2570
01:50:00,550 --> 01:50:05,019
determined on that in my eyes I'm not

2571
01:50:02,889 --> 01:50:08,319
100% sure but that's just what I've

2572
01:50:05,019 --> 01:50:09,969
noticed a flower with a higher THC a

2573
01:50:08,319 --> 01:50:12,908
percentage in it will more likely

2574
01:50:09,969 --> 01:50:15,309
guarantee you a more butter Drazen labs

2575
01:50:12,908 --> 01:50:18,759
to assure yourself of that then I have

2576
01:50:15,309 --> 01:50:24,849
not there's one even when we use dry

2577
01:50:18,760 --> 01:50:28,989
cannabis it's still far more than 95 96

2578
01:50:24,849 --> 01:50:31,039
97 % ta ta yeah and that's a good

2579
01:50:28,988 --> 01:50:33,349
candidate right there that can

2580
01:50:31,039 --> 01:50:35,239
once you press that into rosin form if

2581
01:50:33,350 --> 01:50:36,980
that rosin still contains that high THC

2582
01:50:35,239 --> 01:50:38,000
percentage you're more likely guarantee

2583
01:50:36,979 --> 01:50:41,079
that you're gonna be able to separate it

2584
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:43,369
or with the jar tech make it crash so

2585
01:50:41,079 --> 01:50:47,059
like I did a little been trained for

2586
01:50:43,369 --> 01:50:50,269
example cannabis products frozen dried

2587
01:50:47,060 --> 01:50:54,500
or whatever are in fact in the form of

2588
01:50:50,270 --> 01:50:58,490
genes I'm talking about that's what our

2589
01:50:54,500 --> 01:50:59,329
lab consistently showed for years and I

2590
01:50:58,489 --> 01:51:02,750
agree with that

2591
01:50:59,329 --> 01:51:06,050
definitely you just said jar cure what's

2592
01:51:02,750 --> 01:51:07,970
the jar tech the jar tech is a new

2593
01:51:06,050 --> 01:51:09,980
process as well a lot of the kids are

2594
01:51:07,970 --> 01:51:11,840
getting into nowadays it's just another

2595
01:51:09,979 --> 01:51:14,119
form of consistency that's all it is now

2596
01:51:11,840 --> 01:51:17,150
I do I can mention that there have been

2597
01:51:14,119 --> 01:51:20,539
reports of chirping percentages upping

2598
01:51:17,149 --> 01:51:23,239
with charts with jar tech not much but a

2599
01:51:20,539 --> 01:51:26,000
noticeable amount if you go shout out to

2600
01:51:23,239 --> 01:51:29,179
rosna rosin Brian Brian rosin from

2601
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:32,000
Colorado I think he works with the olio

2602
01:51:29,180 --> 01:51:34,670
team I can't quite remember but the one

2603
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:36,829
that notice showed actual lab results of

2604
01:51:34,670 --> 01:51:39,409
terpene percentages up being in their

2605
01:51:36,829 --> 01:51:41,750
percentages from the raw the rosin in

2606
01:51:39,409 --> 01:51:44,149
its original state to the rosin after

2607
01:51:41,750 --> 01:51:46,520
the jar tech but that's a whole nother

2608
01:51:44,149 --> 01:51:48,289
ballgame in my eyes yeah that's the

2609
01:51:46,520 --> 01:51:53,240
heating and then reheating and my eating

2610
01:51:48,289 --> 01:51:55,640
and then yeah it's a Pho tech I mean but

2611
01:51:53,239 --> 01:51:57,909
that's that's the tech I I enjoy that

2612
01:51:55,640 --> 01:52:00,560
tech to be honest I wish I knew more I

2613
01:51:57,909 --> 01:52:05,420
think it's I think there's something to

2614
01:52:00,560 --> 01:52:09,170
that for a specific end goal longer on

2615
01:52:05,420 --> 01:52:11,090
the show I mean yeah it helps with

2616
01:52:09,170 --> 01:52:12,859
shelf-life and it also helps with carbon

2617
01:52:11,090 --> 01:52:16,310
cartridge filling man I mean and for

2618
01:52:12,859 --> 01:52:20,210
that end goal and I look at all these

2619
01:52:16,310 --> 01:52:23,030
processes and processes like what are

2620
01:52:20,210 --> 01:52:24,949
you trying to do with it right like out

2621
01:52:23,029 --> 01:52:26,989
of a rosin press you can make you know

2622
01:52:24,949 --> 01:52:28,579
rosin ready to be sold at a gram but if

2623
01:52:26,989 --> 01:52:31,369
you want to put it in a cartridge or you

2624
01:52:28,579 --> 01:52:33,619
want to have it in a more viscous form

2625
01:52:31,369 --> 01:52:35,300
through let's say you want to mix it

2626
01:52:33,619 --> 01:52:36,710
with salt with diamonds you know there

2627
01:52:35,300 --> 01:52:38,869
it just depends on what you're trying to

2628
01:52:36,710 --> 01:52:40,670
do and the consistency is really help

2629
01:52:38,869 --> 01:52:44,029
like it's like paint you know if you

2630
01:52:40,670 --> 01:52:44,599
want to paint with a certain consistency

2631
01:52:44,029 --> 01:52:46,639
you're going to

2632
01:52:44,599 --> 01:52:48,619
thinner paint if you're gonna have

2633
01:52:46,639 --> 01:52:50,510
thicker you can use oil and that that's

2634
01:52:48,618 --> 01:52:52,339
what I look at the all of these

2635
01:52:50,510 --> 01:52:54,559
consistencies like and I think what

2636
01:52:52,340 --> 01:52:56,689
you're saying really falls in line with

2637
01:52:54,559 --> 01:53:00,260
that we're you know if you're heating it

2638
01:52:56,689 --> 01:53:02,599
at 200 or for you know 60 minutes or

2639
01:53:00,260 --> 01:53:04,309
less then you're gonna hit those

2640
01:53:02,599 --> 01:53:05,899
consistencies but it's all cold goes

2641
01:53:04,309 --> 01:53:08,809
back to what Sam was kind of alluding to

2642
01:53:05,899 --> 01:53:10,969
you it's all cultivars to specific in

2643
01:53:08,809 --> 01:53:13,550
the way that that kind of does like kind

2644
01:53:10,969 --> 01:53:16,038
of works is really individual to how

2645
01:53:13,550 --> 01:53:20,418
that was kind of even goes back to the

2646
01:53:16,038 --> 01:53:22,188
grow you know so yeah it's the thing

2647
01:53:20,418 --> 01:53:23,628
about it every time it's the same same

2648
01:53:22,189 --> 01:53:25,878
argument every time it's just that

2649
01:53:23,628 --> 01:53:27,229
variable there's so many variables by

2650
01:53:25,878 --> 01:53:29,179
all the way back to the plant and even

2651
01:53:27,229 --> 01:53:31,579
how the grower grew that point no doubt

2652
01:53:29,179 --> 01:53:33,199
yeah so that's what I've seen personally

2653
01:53:31,578 --> 01:53:34,578
is that it's like if you can get

2654
01:53:33,198 --> 01:53:36,288
consistency and start working with

2655
01:53:34,578 --> 01:53:37,549
cultivars that you know really deeply

2656
01:53:36,288 --> 01:53:42,590
and and have a very deep understanding

2657
01:53:37,550 --> 01:53:46,429
of it can be your your your canvas you

2658
01:53:42,590 --> 01:53:49,369
know and then that's that's you know

2659
01:53:46,429 --> 01:53:52,340
that's exciting you know I want you to

2660
01:53:49,368 --> 01:53:53,808
bring up a quick topic back to like the

2661
01:53:52,340 --> 01:53:54,800
fresh frozen process I know a lot of

2662
01:53:53,809 --> 01:53:57,829
people are kind of having the

2663
01:53:54,800 --> 01:53:59,748
conversations as far as cure points and

2664
01:53:57,828 --> 01:54:00,679
things like that with fresh frozen kind

2665
01:53:59,748 --> 01:54:03,288
of the rule of thumb that I've been

2666
01:54:00,679 --> 01:54:05,719
under the assumption of is like cutting

2667
01:54:03,288 --> 01:54:07,219
down your plants within four hours in

2668
01:54:05,719 --> 01:54:08,719
getting them frozen within four hours

2669
01:54:07,219 --> 01:54:10,849
this kind of your quote-unquote whole

2670
01:54:08,719 --> 01:54:11,989
plant fresh frozen but I'm wondering if

2671
01:54:10,849 --> 01:54:15,078
people who have been talking about

2672
01:54:11,988 --> 01:54:18,049
amongst ourselves like a a two by one or

2673
01:54:15,078 --> 01:54:20,929
two or three day low temp cure on flower

2674
01:54:18,050 --> 01:54:23,389
and then freezing it to kind of burn off

2675
01:54:20,929 --> 01:54:24,378
some of those more volatile Terps even

2676
01:54:23,389 --> 01:54:26,449
though they're gonna get burned off

2677
01:54:24,378 --> 01:54:27,979
anyways I'm curious about what you guys

2678
01:54:26,448 --> 01:54:30,498
think about that because I just ran a

2679
01:54:27,979 --> 01:54:33,918
crop I just took five plants I let them

2680
01:54:30,498 --> 01:54:37,628
cure for about two days at 65 degree

2681
01:54:33,918 --> 01:54:41,059
with a slightly higher or spot 60 temp

2682
01:54:37,628 --> 01:54:43,128
60 RH humidity and then I bucked him

2683
01:54:41,059 --> 01:54:44,570
down and froze them I haven't washed

2684
01:54:43,128 --> 01:54:46,608
them yet but I'm curious to see what

2685
01:54:44,569 --> 01:54:49,578
people think about that process or if

2686
01:54:46,609 --> 01:54:52,189
that's even worth it I almost guarantee

2687
01:54:49,578 --> 01:54:54,099
that in some cases it will be worth it

2688
01:54:52,189 --> 01:54:57,130
and in other cases it won't

2689
01:54:54,099 --> 01:54:59,529
gotcha you will find a sweet spot for

2690
01:54:57,130 --> 01:55:01,690
certain plants and certain genetics and

2691
01:54:59,529 --> 01:55:03,309
depending on this insane amount of

2692
01:55:01,689 --> 01:55:06,519
variables that I couldn't even pretend

2693
01:55:03,310 --> 01:55:08,380
to to list off or that could that could

2694
01:55:06,520 --> 01:55:10,150
affect that that could you know where

2695
01:55:08,380 --> 01:55:12,429
it's just certain cultivars the terpene

2696
01:55:10,149 --> 01:55:14,078
profile whatever it is when there's too

2697
01:55:12,429 --> 01:55:15,940
much moisture when it's froze and it

2698
01:55:14,078 --> 01:55:20,219
just has a taste that it doesn't have

2699
01:55:15,939 --> 01:55:20,219
when you cure it out longer because I

2700
01:55:21,779 --> 01:55:29,380
you muted a community buddy was I meet

2701
01:55:25,810 --> 01:55:30,460
it the whole time no just just I was

2702
01:55:29,380 --> 01:55:33,489
like you guys were really kind of

2703
01:55:30,460 --> 01:55:34,510
listening when I anyway I said I liked

2704
01:55:33,488 --> 01:55:36,609
where he was going with the conversation

2705
01:55:34,510 --> 01:55:38,920
and that I haven't done a lot of sort of

2706
01:55:36,609 --> 01:55:41,439
experimenting in that range of like cold

2707
01:55:38,920 --> 01:55:44,020
curing for four days versus ten days

2708
01:55:41,439 --> 01:55:46,089
versus whatever versus freezing it like

2709
01:55:44,020 --> 01:55:49,840
right off off the plant like within an

2710
01:55:46,090 --> 01:55:52,270
hour or two but I did do a lot of dry

2711
01:55:49,840 --> 01:55:54,849
material I used to make a lot of dry

2712
01:55:52,270 --> 01:55:57,130
material bubble like you know not fresh

2713
01:55:54,849 --> 01:55:59,889
frozen at all fresh frozen came a few

2714
01:55:57,130 --> 01:56:01,840
years later and it's funny because the

2715
01:55:59,889 --> 01:56:04,659
reason I had no interest in making fresh

2716
01:56:01,840 --> 01:56:06,489
frozen was because my hash already

2717
01:56:04,658 --> 01:56:09,250
melted into a liquid and dripped through

2718
01:56:06,488 --> 01:56:11,109
the tightest of screens so it was you

2719
01:56:09,250 --> 01:56:14,408
know with that Renee the terpene profile

2720
01:56:11,109 --> 01:56:17,109
was so present even after watery water

2721
01:56:14,408 --> 01:56:18,969
hashing it that it was just I mean it

2722
01:56:17,109 --> 01:56:21,039
really was one of the main reasons that

2723
01:56:18,969 --> 01:56:22,840
I think bubble bags took off because I

2724
01:56:21,039 --> 01:56:25,118
had this very unique access to this

2725
01:56:22,840 --> 01:56:27,340
incredible cultivar that just seemed to

2726
01:56:25,118 --> 01:56:29,408
be made for the banks and I would

2727
01:56:27,340 --> 01:56:32,110
consistently see and and for me how I

2728
01:56:29,408 --> 01:56:34,569
first got into it was I made some water

2729
01:56:32,109 --> 01:56:36,460
hash with some isolator bags prior to

2730
01:56:34,569 --> 01:56:39,130
bubble bags existing about six months

2731
01:56:36,460 --> 01:56:41,618
prior they were maybe a month old and

2732
01:56:39,130 --> 01:56:43,889
I'm I finally got some material from

2733
01:56:41,618 --> 01:56:47,049
breeder Steve it was the shish-kabob

2734
01:56:43,889 --> 01:56:49,109
that washed beautifully it was Rene

2735
01:56:47,050 --> 01:56:52,449
asked in the sense that it just washed

2736
01:56:49,109 --> 01:56:54,399
beautifully it looked like caramel when

2737
01:56:52,448 --> 01:56:57,039
it cured if you pressed it into a block

2738
01:56:54,399 --> 01:56:59,888
it was just like a caramel cube it was

2739
01:56:57,039 --> 01:57:02,738
extremely extremely nice material to

2740
01:56:59,889 --> 01:57:04,840
have access to but the fresh frozen

2741
01:57:02,738 --> 01:57:07,589
thing to me really started fresh frozen

2742
01:57:04,840 --> 01:57:10,230
and micro planing were

2743
01:57:07,590 --> 01:57:14,489
both incredible ways to increase your

2744
01:57:10,229 --> 01:57:16,709
chance of a meltable melting product in

2745
01:57:14,489 --> 01:57:18,359
the end you know using something that

2746
01:57:16,710 --> 01:57:20,909
was as fresh as possible to secure as

2747
01:57:18,359 --> 01:57:22,619
many terpenes as possible and shredding

2748
01:57:20,909 --> 01:57:24,809
the head so that the oil was on the

2749
01:57:22,619 --> 01:57:26,909
outside of the wax membranes so when you

2750
01:57:24,810 --> 01:57:28,920
held a flame to it you saw that little

2751
01:57:26,909 --> 01:57:31,439
sizzle you saw that little bit of melt

2752
01:57:28,920 --> 01:57:33,270
and that's kind of what I thought that's

2753
01:57:31,439 --> 01:57:34,649
what my perspective was when I saw it

2754
01:57:33,270 --> 01:57:39,090
first happening because here I was

2755
01:57:34,649 --> 01:57:41,609
making stuff with very dry material and

2756
01:57:39,090 --> 01:57:43,619
it was so melty and so caramely and it

2757
01:57:41,609 --> 01:57:46,949
was basically the question I got all the

2758
01:57:43,619 --> 01:57:50,519
time was how do I make my hash look like

2759
01:57:46,949 --> 01:57:52,139
yours and I was like I the grower it's

2760
01:57:50,520 --> 01:57:54,450
like it's all I did was isolate the

2761
01:57:52,140 --> 01:57:55,500
heads you're using the same product to

2762
01:57:54,449 --> 01:57:57,809
isolate your heads

2763
01:57:55,500 --> 01:57:59,640
it's the grower and the genetics that we

2764
01:57:57,810 --> 01:58:02,250
need to that you need to get a better

2765
01:57:59,640 --> 01:58:04,710
relationship with so for me bubble bags

2766
01:58:02,250 --> 01:58:06,689
were like a guiding light along your

2767
01:58:04,710 --> 01:58:08,850
path way of learning about these things

2768
01:58:06,689 --> 01:58:11,489
because it could show you when you use

2769
01:58:08,850 --> 01:58:13,650
material that wasn't grown properly that

2770
01:58:11,489 --> 01:58:15,479
wasn't good enough it would show you in

2771
01:58:13,649 --> 01:58:17,369
the end results like oh why is my hash

2772
01:58:15,479 --> 01:58:20,369
sandy why isn't it sticking together

2773
01:58:17,369 --> 01:58:22,800
it's like Oh cuz you grew subpar pot or

2774
01:58:20,369 --> 01:58:23,880
someone grew subpar genetics and didn't

2775
01:58:22,800 --> 01:58:28,680
grow it very well

2776
01:58:23,880 --> 01:58:36,029
hey welcome welcome wait Cheers

2777
01:58:28,680 --> 01:58:38,369
Cruz sure is I'm good I'm on the I'm on

2778
01:58:36,029 --> 01:58:41,840
hash Church this morning oh I didn't

2779
01:58:38,369 --> 01:58:41,840
think he was talking to us right now

2780
01:58:43,760 --> 01:58:51,720
awesome I could hear you I was like -

2781
01:58:49,199 --> 01:58:53,130
that fresh frozen no so I'm under I'm

2782
01:58:51,720 --> 01:58:54,960
under the assumption that when we first

2783
01:58:53,130 --> 01:58:56,850
when we first cut down our plants those

2784
01:58:54,960 --> 01:58:59,310
heads you know speaking of them thinking

2785
01:58:56,850 --> 01:59:01,950
about the heads in particular like the

2786
01:58:59,310 --> 01:59:03,690
heads are really soft and malleable in a

2787
01:59:01,949 --> 01:59:06,239
sense that they're they're not they

2788
01:59:03,689 --> 01:59:08,819
haven't had a chance to actually the wax

2789
01:59:06,239 --> 01:59:15,689
membrane build a solid coating or

2790
01:59:08,819 --> 01:59:16,409
foundation with the cure correct say

2791
01:59:15,689 --> 01:59:18,299
that again

2792
01:59:16,409 --> 01:59:21,319
they're like the the fresh frozen heads

2793
01:59:18,300 --> 01:59:24,079
compared to cured cured bud heads

2794
01:59:21,319 --> 01:59:26,989
those are gonna be a lot softer the met

2795
01:59:24,079 --> 01:59:31,250
waxed membrane not as rigid as stea

2796
01:59:26,989 --> 01:59:32,869
cured but correct in my eye I would

2797
01:59:31,250 --> 01:59:36,520
think that you're talking about the

2798
01:59:32,869 --> 01:59:40,449
cured heads the wax membrane yeah first

2799
01:59:36,520 --> 01:59:43,520
I would assume it would be harder than

2800
01:59:40,449 --> 01:59:45,229
softer when it was cured that it was

2801
01:59:43,520 --> 01:59:46,970
that it would be softer when it was

2802
01:59:45,229 --> 01:59:50,000
fresh that it would have moisture in it

2803
01:59:46,970 --> 01:59:52,340
and that it was you know absolutely true

2804
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:56,029
because the same variety when it's

2805
01:59:52,340 --> 02:00:00,199
growing on the plant sometimes the resin

2806
01:59:56,029 --> 02:00:04,759
almost kills oily exact week or two and

2807
02:00:00,199 --> 02:00:07,849
it feels really greasy better you think

2808
02:00:04,760 --> 02:00:12,739
about like a grape you dry it even more

2809
02:00:07,850 --> 02:00:16,250
and it turns in from great to present

2810
02:00:12,739 --> 02:00:20,239
yeah I bring that up because going back

2811
02:00:16,250 --> 02:00:20,930
to the pure process what's that sound

2812
02:00:20,239 --> 02:00:24,859
like ma'am

2813
02:00:20,930 --> 02:00:27,890
I said then they can be worked with and

2814
02:00:24,859 --> 02:00:29,089
handled easily when they're dry correct

2815
02:00:27,890 --> 02:00:31,100
so I'm trying to find the happy medium

2816
02:00:29,090 --> 02:00:33,380
between the fresh frozen and the cures

2817
02:00:31,100 --> 02:00:35,210
wait that's why I'm trying to do like a

2818
02:00:33,380 --> 02:00:37,880
two or three-day low temp cure because I

2819
02:00:35,210 --> 02:00:40,250
feel like in my head that those resin

2820
02:00:37,880 --> 02:00:42,650
heads the wax membrane will cool that

2821
02:00:40,250 --> 02:00:45,680
just a couple days will allow that to

2822
02:00:42,649 --> 02:00:47,509
kind of solidify and I'll go keep that

2823
02:00:45,680 --> 02:00:49,940
Terr profile of the fresh frozen to a

2824
02:00:47,510 --> 02:00:52,880
certain extent it's also the reason why

2825
02:00:49,939 --> 02:00:57,579
you want varieties will you grow them

2826
02:00:52,880 --> 02:01:00,560
they're so damned terpene rich because

2827
02:00:57,579 --> 02:01:03,939
after you've dried them and you peered

2828
02:01:00,560 --> 02:01:07,160
at the three months in the box gets its

2829
02:01:03,939 --> 02:01:13,009
operation but it's still really dirty

2830
02:01:07,159 --> 02:01:14,930
rich inside that wax at the truth yeah

2831
02:01:13,010 --> 02:01:17,900
I'll tell ya the first time I smoked

2832
02:01:14,930 --> 02:01:19,970
Sam's hash and it was just bone dry and

2833
02:01:17,899 --> 02:01:21,799
it was just like I was just like how is

2834
02:01:19,970 --> 02:01:25,400
this gonna have any taste it was like a

2835
02:01:21,800 --> 02:01:27,380
flavor explosion in my mouth

2836
02:01:25,399 --> 02:01:29,869
and it was the highest I ever got in the

2837
02:01:27,380 --> 02:01:31,730
shortest amount of time like instantly I

2838
02:01:29,869 --> 02:01:35,180
was just like wow like I

2839
02:01:31,729 --> 02:01:37,039
I'm home this is our thesis for me this

2840
02:01:35,180 --> 02:01:38,659
Amherst diesel from Humboldt seat of

2841
02:01:37,039 --> 02:01:40,159
organization holy [ __ ]

2842
02:01:38,659 --> 02:01:42,050
I thought originally thought it was the

2843
02:01:40,159 --> 02:01:44,029
cantaloupe cush it's like on the on the

2844
02:01:42,050 --> 02:01:47,000
vine so to speak on the stock it smells

2845
02:01:44,029 --> 02:01:47,988
like a ripe cantaloupe and it's Amherst

2846
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:49,988
Sour Diesel

2847
02:01:47,988 --> 02:01:53,029
so I'm not sure what the cross is

2848
02:01:49,988 --> 02:01:55,250
exactly but that's what I have here with

2849
02:01:53,029 --> 02:01:56,929
the 2/3 de kere on it I've done a full

2850
02:01:55,250 --> 02:01:58,310
two week here and I've done it fresh

2851
02:01:56,930 --> 02:02:01,489
frozen so now this is my middle

2852
02:01:58,310 --> 02:02:05,470
experiment no all the processing curing

2853
02:02:01,488 --> 02:02:09,109
and everything of course it changes

2854
02:02:05,470 --> 02:02:11,300
obvious even example is become much it

2855
02:02:09,109 --> 02:02:14,719
changes the last week or two before you

2856
02:02:11,300 --> 02:02:16,640
harvest it yep it gets into that

2857
02:02:14,720 --> 02:02:19,430
old-school versus new-school and I

2858
02:02:16,640 --> 02:02:23,210
remember I can't remember his name now

2859
02:02:19,430 --> 02:02:24,890
he had a seed company it's crazy that I

2860
02:02:23,210 --> 02:02:28,130
can't remember his name

2861
02:02:24,890 --> 02:02:30,400
Dutch no he was an American Tony what

2862
02:02:28,130 --> 02:02:33,859
was Tony's company's name Sega Martha

2863
02:02:30,399 --> 02:02:36,769
yes okay Sega Martha so I'm puffing with

2864
02:02:33,859 --> 02:02:38,899
Tony in Amsterdam some years back I've

2865
02:02:36,770 --> 02:02:41,210
got this like beautiful sweet skunk like

2866
02:02:38,899 --> 02:02:43,399
you know the herb was cured and dried

2867
02:02:41,210 --> 02:02:45,470
for months and then the hash was cured

2868
02:02:43,399 --> 02:02:47,299
and dried for months and it was just

2869
02:02:45,470 --> 02:02:48,949
this like light powder and I had it in

2870
02:02:47,300 --> 02:02:51,739
Amsterdam and I was puffing it with

2871
02:02:48,949 --> 02:02:53,689
everyone but I puffed it with him and he

2872
02:02:51,738 --> 02:02:56,479
took a big hit he blew it out and he was

2873
02:02:53,689 --> 02:02:58,759
just like about five minutes later he

2874
02:02:56,479 --> 02:03:00,738
just said dude what was that and I was

2875
02:02:58,760 --> 02:03:02,989
like oh it was some sweet skunk dry

2876
02:03:00,738 --> 02:03:04,729
sniffed and he's like he's like man it's

2877
02:03:02,988 --> 02:03:07,129
the first thing I've smoked in like nine

2878
02:03:04,729 --> 02:03:09,709
days that just didn't explode like make

2879
02:03:07,130 --> 02:03:12,230
me cough so horribly like just razor

2880
02:03:09,710 --> 02:03:15,109
blades in my throat and I was like yeah

2881
02:03:12,229 --> 02:03:18,019
like when you when you cure out those

2882
02:03:15,109 --> 02:03:20,659
lighter terpenes those those first batch

2883
02:03:18,020 --> 02:03:22,940
that are just they're just harsh which

2884
02:03:20,659 --> 02:03:25,340
just seems to be what nowadays the

2885
02:03:22,939 --> 02:03:27,799
younger people are wanting they want all

2886
02:03:25,340 --> 02:03:30,199
of it fresh frozen live living in the

2887
02:03:27,800 --> 02:03:33,079
plants smoking it so they're just like

2888
02:03:30,199 --> 02:03:35,599
turning red and coughing and I'm I've

2889
02:03:33,079 --> 02:03:37,699
been on both sides so I see it but I

2890
02:03:35,600 --> 02:03:39,289
really appreciated Tony seeing it and

2891
02:03:37,699 --> 02:03:40,969
appreciating it and saying hey I'm

2892
02:03:39,289 --> 02:03:42,920
telling you that was like the most

2893
02:03:40,969 --> 02:03:44,969
enjoyable thing I've smoked all week

2894
02:03:42,920 --> 02:03:47,369
just like that's what

2895
02:03:44,969 --> 02:03:49,469
some nice cured resin it doesn't like

2896
02:03:47,369 --> 02:03:51,510
you know it's just like sometimes you

2897
02:03:49,469 --> 02:03:53,130
just want to have a nice a nice rim once

2898
02:03:51,510 --> 02:03:55,860
again it's a quiver for me I'm I don't

2899
02:03:53,130 --> 02:03:59,460
want to get sucked into one or the other

2900
02:03:55,859 --> 02:04:02,639
with cannabis I want to be able to allow

2901
02:03:59,460 --> 02:04:05,189
everyone within my own judgments to just

2902
02:04:02,640 --> 02:04:06,810
enjoy all of it to be having fun with it

2903
02:04:05,189 --> 02:04:09,089
you're having fun with cannabis great

2904
02:04:06,810 --> 02:04:10,620
you're playing around and experimenting

2905
02:04:09,090 --> 02:04:12,449
awesome you know

2906
02:04:10,619 --> 02:04:13,920
consume your own experiments don't sell

2907
02:04:12,448 --> 02:04:18,059
them on the open market but other than

2908
02:04:13,920 --> 02:04:19,739
that I think you know like when you're

2909
02:04:18,060 --> 02:04:23,310
doing like chemical experiments and

2910
02:04:19,738 --> 02:04:24,929
stuff like Horatio used to be doing the

2911
02:04:23,310 --> 02:04:27,120
D limonene I was always like you know

2912
02:04:24,930 --> 02:04:28,829
like for a long time he didn't release

2913
02:04:27,119 --> 02:04:30,988
that stuff it was like more like yeah

2914
02:04:28,829 --> 02:04:32,430
just consume your own experiments until

2915
02:04:30,988 --> 02:04:34,769
you figure out the first mistakes you

2916
02:04:32,430 --> 02:04:36,480
were making and then once you've got

2917
02:04:34,770 --> 02:04:41,250
that taken care of now let the general

2918
02:04:36,479 --> 02:04:44,039
public check it out yep

2919
02:04:41,250 --> 02:04:45,840
that's what's up [ __ ] great

2920
02:04:44,039 --> 02:04:48,000
conversation today everyone couple of

2921
02:04:45,840 --> 02:04:51,060
hours burned not too bad at all I

2922
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:53,130
enjoyed it I think I think we'll cut it

2923
02:04:51,060 --> 02:04:54,750
here but maybe plan oh no weights back

2924
02:04:53,130 --> 02:04:56,550
we got to do some more time for weight

2925
02:04:54,750 --> 02:05:00,659
are you hanging with us this time wait

2926
02:04:56,550 --> 02:05:03,150
Nevada County I am having trouble

2927
02:05:00,659 --> 02:05:05,670
figuring out why my device won't let

2928
02:05:03,149 --> 02:05:09,779
y'all see what I'm doing this morning

2929
02:05:05,670 --> 02:05:12,420
but I can talk good morning good morning

2930
02:05:09,779 --> 02:05:14,130
we were just I was just about to wrap up

2931
02:05:12,420 --> 02:05:15,930
hash Church you came back in and then I

2932
02:05:14,130 --> 02:05:18,000
was like we're going again it's like the

2933
02:05:15,930 --> 02:05:21,449
life line of the show has been pumped

2934
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:22,800
right back in oh thank you we want to

2935
02:05:21,448 --> 02:05:26,639
hear from you man what do you been up to

2936
02:05:22,800 --> 02:05:28,940
how are things things are pretty

2937
02:05:26,640 --> 02:05:30,930
exciting here in Nevada County still

2938
02:05:28,939 --> 02:05:33,779
trying to figure out what to do about

2939
02:05:30,930 --> 02:05:35,489
the fact that Governor Brown vetoed The

2940
02:05:33,779 --> 02:05:37,139
Compassionate Use Act which has been a

2941
02:05:35,488 --> 02:05:39,629
real focus of our tivity for the less

2942
02:05:37,140 --> 02:05:45,539
complete respect the ridiculous thing it

2943
02:05:39,630 --> 02:05:49,800
is a ridiculous thing and I quite

2944
02:05:45,539 --> 02:05:51,960
honestly what I what I and the other

2945
02:05:49,800 --> 02:05:57,600
folks that are helping forests are doing

2946
02:05:51,960 --> 02:06:02,909
is we haven't really stopped doing what

2947
02:05:57,600 --> 02:06:05,699
we were doing we just I can't believe

2948
02:06:02,909 --> 02:06:09,750
I'm saying this on show like this but

2949
02:06:05,698 --> 02:06:11,369
we're being more discreet about it you

2950
02:06:09,750 --> 02:06:12,420
can't stop doing what you guys are doing

2951
02:06:11,369 --> 02:06:15,149
what you guys are doing is so

2952
02:06:12,420 --> 02:06:17,730
instrumental to this industry in a hole

2953
02:06:15,149 --> 02:06:20,159
even if it's a small thing you guys in

2954
02:06:17,729 --> 02:06:22,198
forests are [ __ ] amazing and you guys

2955
02:06:20,159 --> 02:06:24,179
cannot stop yeah you guys are doing the

2956
02:06:22,198 --> 02:06:25,349
right the good it's it's the right thing

2957
02:06:24,179 --> 02:06:27,989
you're on there you're on the right side

2958
02:06:25,350 --> 02:06:30,110
of it so no matter what happens to me

2959
02:06:27,988 --> 02:06:32,789
it's just like okay well I guess a

2960
02:06:30,109 --> 02:06:37,369
deeper level of civil disobedience is

2961
02:06:32,789 --> 02:06:41,159
now required yes yes well after years of

2962
02:06:37,369 --> 02:06:45,630
you know breaking unjust laws she is a

2963
02:06:41,159 --> 02:06:47,429
phrase I kind of gotten used to trying

2964
02:06:45,630 --> 02:06:51,029
to figure out how to obey the rules and

2965
02:06:47,429 --> 02:06:53,730
how to go along with regulators and

2966
02:06:51,029 --> 02:06:58,349
authorities and whatnot and it's it's

2967
02:06:53,729 --> 02:07:00,119
just been a real strong lesson that in

2968
02:06:58,350 --> 02:07:01,860
the law of unintended consequences

2969
02:07:00,119 --> 02:07:04,159
because particularly forests put an

2970
02:07:01,859 --> 02:07:06,509
incredible amount of work into getting

2971
02:07:04,159 --> 02:07:09,448
8:29 through the legislature last year

2972
02:07:06,510 --> 02:07:14,340
and then to have it vetoed like that was

2973
02:07:09,448 --> 02:07:16,500
really messed up no such a thing like

2974
02:07:14,340 --> 02:07:18,150
whoo what is that like Satan just like

2975
02:07:16,500 --> 02:07:24,479
came up from hell and was like I'm gonna

2976
02:07:18,149 --> 02:07:28,738
veto this bill well all I can come up

2977
02:07:24,479 --> 02:07:31,229
with all I can come up with is that the

2978
02:07:28,738 --> 02:07:34,559
folks who are too charged with doing the

2979
02:07:31,229 --> 02:07:36,359
regulations in California had no way to

2980
02:07:34,560 --> 02:07:37,770
deal with the idea that there were

2981
02:07:36,359 --> 02:07:42,049
people out there who were giving

2982
02:07:37,770 --> 02:07:44,610
cannabis away when the law is very clear

2983
02:07:42,050 --> 02:07:46,590
in California at least you can't give

2984
02:07:44,609 --> 02:07:47,880
cannabis away even personal use cannabis

2985
02:07:46,590 --> 02:07:51,239
you can't give it away

2986
02:07:47,880 --> 02:07:54,029
Wow so that's socks dude we can give

2987
02:07:51,238 --> 02:07:55,889
cannabis away up to an ounce just give

2988
02:07:54,029 --> 02:07:58,949
it away give it away give it away

2989
02:07:55,890 --> 02:08:00,840
now well awesome it's not the case in

2990
02:07:58,949 --> 02:08:09,210
California if you're gonna obey all the

2991
02:08:00,840 --> 02:08:14,310
rules anyway down to a branch not under

2992
02:08:09,210 --> 02:08:18,569
personal use rules Sam the personal use

2993
02:08:14,310 --> 02:08:23,400
when marcsa as we call it the marijuana

2994
02:08:18,569 --> 02:08:25,500
it was called the marijuana and I don't

2995
02:08:23,399 --> 02:08:27,000
remember it was back in 2016 when the

2996
02:08:25,500 --> 02:08:30,029
new set of laws in California were

2997
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:32,039
enacted they talked about personal use

2998
02:08:30,029 --> 02:08:34,559
and one of the things is you can grow

2999
02:08:32,039 --> 02:08:36,300
six personal use plants for your own use

3000
02:08:34,560 --> 02:08:37,770
but you literally can't give them to

3001
02:08:36,300 --> 02:08:40,500
anyone else in your family you can't

3002
02:08:37,770 --> 02:08:42,630
give it to you fam to your friends

3003
02:08:40,500 --> 02:08:45,560
nothing that's what the law says of

3004
02:08:42,630 --> 02:08:48,989
course that's not what's happening but

3005
02:08:45,560 --> 02:08:52,260
and my so my take on it is that the

3006
02:08:48,989 --> 02:08:54,659
folks in charge of regulation the Bureau

3007
02:08:52,260 --> 02:08:57,539
of cannabis control the Department of

3008
02:08:54,659 --> 02:09:00,119
Public Health and the Department of Food

3009
02:08:57,539 --> 02:09:03,569
and Agriculture who are the folks to do

3010
02:09:00,119 --> 02:09:05,970
with the cannabis regulations in

3011
02:09:03,569 --> 02:09:07,739
California basically said to the

3012
02:09:05,970 --> 02:09:11,039
governor you can't do this to us

3013
02:09:07,739 --> 02:09:12,510
you can't sign a law that goes totally

3014
02:09:11,039 --> 02:09:15,539
contrary to everything else we've been

3015
02:09:12,510 --> 02:09:19,579
doing for the last two years be to it

3016
02:09:15,539 --> 02:09:22,769
and he did that's all I can come up with

3017
02:09:19,579 --> 02:09:25,890
technically you maybe you are correct

3018
02:09:22,770 --> 02:09:29,030
because you're living there I'm not but

3019
02:09:25,890 --> 02:09:31,770
it makes no difference because it

3020
02:09:29,029 --> 02:09:33,659
somebody comes to your house and you

3021
02:09:31,770 --> 02:09:37,380
give them less than an ounce of

3022
02:09:33,659 --> 02:09:40,260
marijuana as a yeah and they take it

3023
02:09:37,380 --> 02:09:43,590
with them they can transport it legally

3024
02:09:40,260 --> 02:09:45,570
because it's their marijuana as long as

3025
02:09:43,590 --> 02:09:47,010
they keep their mouth shut but we're

3026
02:09:45,569 --> 02:09:49,229
talking about children right now are we

3027
02:09:47,010 --> 02:09:50,640
we are talking about children and we're

3028
02:09:49,229 --> 02:09:55,169
not talking about people who are getting

3029
02:09:50,640 --> 02:09:58,470
ounce of flowers we'll get in so there's

3030
02:09:55,170 --> 02:10:05,149
no to enforce it in fact if a person

3031
02:09:58,470 --> 02:10:05,150
just says it's their marijuana true

3032
02:10:06,800 --> 02:10:11,469
that's true

3033
02:10:08,979 --> 02:10:14,289
but particularly in the cases that I'm

3034
02:10:11,469 --> 02:10:16,899
talking about we're not we're not giving

3035
02:10:14,288 --> 02:10:21,458
anybody trim flowers or or bags of bud

3036
02:10:16,899 --> 02:10:24,399
they're getting oils and preparations

3037
02:10:21,458 --> 02:10:27,158
formulations where we take concentrated

3038
02:10:24,399 --> 02:10:32,969
oils and mix them into other things to

3039
02:10:27,158 --> 02:10:36,248
make products for the of their needs so

3040
02:10:32,969 --> 02:10:37,989
anyway it's a and we had a whole you

3041
02:10:36,248 --> 02:10:40,649
know Chain of Custody a whole group of

3042
02:10:37,988 --> 02:10:44,018
folk who were helping this to happen and

3043
02:10:40,649 --> 02:10:47,408
a lot of them are trying to get permits

3044
02:10:44,019 --> 02:10:50,400
and so there's this whole funny thing

3045
02:10:47,408 --> 02:10:53,078
going on in the work right now around

3046
02:10:50,399 --> 02:10:55,179
trying to what we're doing at a local

3047
02:10:53,078 --> 02:11:00,908
level and I probably shouldn't say this

3048
02:10:55,179 --> 02:11:02,529
as well we there is a thing in

3049
02:11:00,908 --> 02:11:05,708
California law that allows for

3050
02:11:02,529 --> 02:11:08,738
compassion guidance but local ordinance

3051
02:11:05,708 --> 02:11:10,269
has to include it so we're working on

3052
02:11:08,738 --> 02:11:13,328
that front right now

3053
02:11:10,269 --> 02:11:15,880
at the local level and at the state

3054
02:11:13,328 --> 02:11:19,689
level

3055
02:11:15,880 --> 02:11:22,359
Senate bill 37 is already in the books

3056
02:11:19,689 --> 02:11:25,178
and working its way through committee I

3057
02:11:22,359 --> 02:11:27,399
think it is Senate bill 37 which would

3058
02:11:25,179 --> 02:11:30,819
basically re-establish the compassion

3059
02:11:27,399 --> 02:11:33,748
abuse program so that's kind of where

3060
02:11:30,819 --> 02:11:36,340
it's at at the moment forced and I are

3061
02:11:33,748 --> 02:11:37,899
because of all of this craziness forced

3062
02:11:36,340 --> 02:11:41,860
and I have actually submitted an

3063
02:11:37,899 --> 02:11:44,439
application in Nevada City to do the

3064
02:11:41,859 --> 02:11:46,268
simplest form of manufacturing which

3065
02:11:44,439 --> 02:11:47,618
would allow us to do formulations and

3066
02:11:46,269 --> 02:11:50,170
make some of the things that we've done

3067
02:11:47,618 --> 02:11:51,578
in the legal framework while working

3068
02:11:50,170 --> 02:11:55,239
with other folks who are in the legal

3069
02:11:51,578 --> 02:11:56,978
framework and it'll probably be the end

3070
02:11:55,238 --> 02:11:59,708
of this year before we have license and

3071
02:11:56,979 --> 02:12:02,499
actually actually can operate but we've

3072
02:11:59,708 --> 02:12:04,149
started the process is that the simplest

3073
02:12:02,498 --> 02:12:06,958
form so are you speaking of like a type

3074
02:12:04,149 --> 02:12:11,348
6 or type 2 or type 7 with solvent based

3075
02:12:06,958 --> 02:12:13,658
type 6 with just formulations no

3076
02:12:11,349 --> 02:12:15,519
extractions at all God should be

3077
02:12:13,658 --> 02:12:18,219
reaching out to some of the folks that

3078
02:12:15,519 --> 02:12:20,019
have the manufacturing licenses in order

3079
02:12:18,219 --> 02:12:21,520
to secure some of the oils that we need

3080
02:12:20,019 --> 02:12:22,869
we'll be working because even in

3081
02:12:21,520 --> 02:12:25,360
County there's a there's not too many

3082
02:12:22,869 --> 02:12:27,099
people even allowed to to have those of

3083
02:12:25,359 --> 02:12:29,649
them under my assumption right as far as

3084
02:12:27,100 --> 02:12:33,460
manufacturing licenses and whatnot oh

3085
02:12:29,649 --> 02:12:35,170
that's totally true I'm really close to

3086
02:12:33,460 --> 02:12:38,189
you so I can't wait to link up I'm

3087
02:12:35,170 --> 02:12:40,690
actually in Placer County oh dude well

3088
02:12:38,189 --> 02:12:47,819
who's ray combs I don't know

3089
02:12:40,689 --> 02:12:54,479
Brackins yep oh you got a beautiful

3090
02:12:47,819 --> 02:12:58,799
speaking of children yeah no absolutely

3091
02:12:54,479 --> 02:12:58,799
he'll bring his Harry Potter wand over

3092
02:12:59,789 --> 02:13:03,579
yeah there might be things that we can

3093
02:13:01,779 --> 02:13:06,670
help each other on to get because I want

3094
02:13:03,579 --> 02:13:07,869
to continue or help continue that what

3095
02:13:06,670 --> 02:13:09,909
you guys are doing as much as possible

3096
02:13:07,869 --> 02:13:12,069
as far as veterans and children I mean

3097
02:13:09,909 --> 02:13:15,489
they need as much help as we can offer

3098
02:13:12,069 --> 02:13:17,199
so through that

3099
02:13:15,489 --> 02:13:24,010
yeah the BET's that's a whole nother

3100
02:13:17,199 --> 02:13:25,479
conversation that is [ __ ] up I don't

3101
02:13:24,010 --> 02:13:27,190
want to take up everybody's time but I

3102
02:13:25,479 --> 02:13:29,739
heard a story the other day speaking of

3103
02:13:27,189 --> 02:13:31,029
vets that really was infuriating and

3104
02:13:29,739 --> 02:13:36,609
it's a good example of how the

3105
02:13:31,029 --> 02:13:39,369
California regulated market is working I

3106
02:13:36,609 --> 02:13:43,599
met a guy a couple of days ago he's a

3107
02:13:39,369 --> 02:13:45,309
hundred percent disability from wounds

3108
02:13:43,600 --> 02:13:48,340
received in Iraq

3109
02:13:45,310 --> 02:13:52,720
his wife is 90 percent disability for

3110
02:13:48,340 --> 02:13:57,220
the same thing they have a a child who

3111
02:13:52,720 --> 02:13:58,360
is challenged health-wise and they live

3112
02:13:57,220 --> 02:14:03,100
here in Nevada County they bought

3113
02:13:58,359 --> 02:14:07,389
property long story short they applied

3114
02:14:03,100 --> 02:14:10,300
for a permit I haven't got all the

3115
02:14:07,390 --> 02:14:15,130
details but one of the things that

3116
02:14:10,300 --> 02:14:18,010
happened is be cut yeah I don't want to

3117
02:14:15,130 --> 02:14:21,430
let's say anyway their property was

3118
02:14:18,010 --> 02:14:22,869
recently reassessed for the improvements

3119
02:14:21,430 --> 02:14:24,970
they had made they still haven't gotten

3120
02:14:22,869 --> 02:14:27,250
their permit but meantime they've had to

3121
02:14:24,970 --> 02:14:29,070
shut down their operations there the

3122
02:14:27,250 --> 02:14:32,289
valuation on their home went from

3123
02:14:29,069 --> 02:14:34,119
300,000 to almost 500,000 which meant

3124
02:14:32,289 --> 02:14:34,960
that property taxes went up dramatically

3125
02:14:34,119 --> 02:14:36,369
right

3126
02:14:34,960 --> 02:14:39,039
time when they're trying to get into the

3127
02:14:36,369 --> 02:14:41,409
system and basically they're considering

3128
02:14:39,039 --> 02:14:43,269
they're looking at having to move sell

3129
02:14:41,409 --> 02:14:45,789
their home and move because they can't

3130
02:14:43,270 --> 02:14:47,620
afford the property taxes for the place

3131
02:14:45,789 --> 02:14:49,750
that they're in and these are a hundred

3132
02:14:47,619 --> 02:14:52,199
percent and ninety percent disabled

3133
02:14:49,750 --> 02:14:54,670
veterans with a health challenge child

3134
02:14:52,199 --> 02:14:56,319
basically being run out of the market

3135
02:14:54,670 --> 02:14:57,969
that's the way the regulated market is

3136
02:14:56,319 --> 02:15:00,509
working in California and a lot of it

3137
02:14:57,969 --> 02:15:03,969
has to do with state regulation and

3138
02:15:00,510 --> 02:15:07,719
local jurisdictions local jurisdictions

3139
02:15:03,969 --> 02:15:10,449
have all kind of a choice about how they

3140
02:15:07,719 --> 02:15:12,550
want to treat cannabis city in their

3141
02:15:10,449 --> 02:15:14,439
your city and county regulations are

3142
02:15:12,550 --> 02:15:16,210
regulated are like the ones you got to

3143
02:15:14,439 --> 02:15:17,979
jump through first correct that's

3144
02:15:16,210 --> 02:15:19,810
absolutely right you have to get your

3145
02:15:17,979 --> 02:15:23,559
permit locally before you can even talk

3146
02:15:19,810 --> 02:15:25,150
to the state so that's different how

3147
02:15:23,560 --> 02:15:26,890
they're they're approaching it out west

3148
02:15:25,149 --> 02:15:29,170
than they are out in the East Coast in

3149
02:15:26,890 --> 02:15:30,700
some respects I mean some states we call

3150
02:15:29,170 --> 02:15:32,640
it to check the Box state and then you

3151
02:15:30,699 --> 02:15:35,559
have to go to the local component and

3152
02:15:32,640 --> 02:15:38,079
the other ones are just pitting you know

3153
02:15:35,560 --> 02:15:40,600
blind tests you know which are not

3154
02:15:38,079 --> 02:15:43,840
healthy for anybody because people that

3155
02:15:40,600 --> 02:15:45,430
aren't unfit to be operating with

3156
02:15:43,840 --> 02:15:47,590
intentions that have nothing to do with

3157
02:15:45,430 --> 02:15:51,039
patients are will the ones that are

3158
02:15:47,590 --> 02:15:53,940
winning those license so it's it's a

3159
02:15:51,039 --> 02:16:01,060
double-edged sword out there you know

3160
02:15:53,939 --> 02:16:03,849
definitely so I see some see some Show

3161
02:16:01,060 --> 02:16:05,739
and Tell happening yeah my [ __ ]

3162
02:16:03,850 --> 02:16:07,630
camera sucks but I'm just trying to show

3163
02:16:05,738 --> 02:16:09,879
that before and after of what the

3164
02:16:07,630 --> 02:16:11,609
Diamonds kind of look like oh yeah hold

3165
02:16:09,880 --> 02:16:14,199
it more in the middle of the frame

3166
02:16:11,609 --> 02:16:15,488
mm-hmm it's not just your camera that

3167
02:16:14,199 --> 02:16:19,439
sucks it's your placement that's

3168
02:16:15,488 --> 02:16:19,439
seriously [ __ ] off bring it up in the

3169
02:16:26,659 --> 02:16:30,829
[Laughter]

3170
02:16:31,800 --> 02:16:37,719
so timeout that's your wands broken or

3171
02:16:35,110 --> 02:16:39,400
that's like crashed in the jar that's a

3172
02:16:37,719 --> 02:16:41,679
that the one's broken down so this is

3173
02:16:39,399 --> 02:16:43,809
the original Drazen yeah

3174
02:16:41,680 --> 02:16:46,210
it's hopefully a fresh frozen and then

3175
02:16:43,809 --> 02:16:49,209
this I wish I had a flash on here but

3176
02:16:46,209 --> 02:16:53,549
and then this is the top fraction mixed

3177
02:16:49,209 --> 02:16:57,669
with the THCA crystals or diamonds

3178
02:16:53,549 --> 02:17:01,479
beautiful love that amber so on that

3179
02:16:57,670 --> 02:17:03,010
same topic too you know I think Marcus

3180
02:17:01,479 --> 02:17:05,229
you and I talked about amber color

3181
02:17:03,010 --> 02:17:07,750
versus clear color versus caramel color

3182
02:17:05,229 --> 02:17:11,889
versus everything I think that's been a

3183
02:17:07,750 --> 02:17:15,790
conversation as well you know do you do

3184
02:17:11,889 --> 02:17:18,879
we do we believe that clear rosin is a

3185
02:17:15,790 --> 02:17:22,150
better superior product over aged amber

3186
02:17:18,879 --> 02:17:24,699
heads I mean for me I just agree that if

3187
02:17:22,149 --> 02:17:27,369
it is when I smoke it than it is and if

3188
02:17:24,700 --> 02:17:32,470
it isn't when I smoke it then it isn't I

3189
02:17:27,370 --> 02:17:35,890
don't think it's anything I think that

3190
02:17:32,469 --> 02:17:43,779
color has nothing to do with quality it

3191
02:17:35,889 --> 02:17:49,779
is oxidization of TNT sure good but that

3192
02:17:43,780 --> 02:17:52,120
said I'd prefer dried and cured resin so

3193
02:17:49,780 --> 02:17:54,690
then it can be good well yeah exactly

3194
02:17:52,120 --> 02:17:57,370
that's it

3195
02:17:54,690 --> 02:18:00,610
can I pop in here on the issue of color

3196
02:17:57,370 --> 02:18:04,600
yeah for most of the preparations that

3197
02:18:00,610 --> 02:18:07,600
we use we want the full extract we don't

3198
02:18:04,600 --> 02:18:08,979
want distillate distillate is really

3199
02:18:07,600 --> 02:18:11,079
good at concentrating certain

3200
02:18:08,979 --> 02:18:12,489
cannabinoids and whatnot and I I'm not

3201
02:18:11,079 --> 02:18:16,360
going to get into try and talk to you

3202
02:18:12,489 --> 02:18:19,739
guys about that but and I could be wrong

3203
02:18:16,360 --> 02:18:22,560
about this but our goal mostly in

3204
02:18:19,739 --> 02:18:26,949
securing oils that we use for the kids

3205
02:18:22,559 --> 02:18:28,600
we want color we want as much of the

3206
02:18:26,950 --> 02:18:31,920
original chemistry that was in that

3207
02:18:28,600 --> 02:18:34,030
plant as possible in the plant's

3208
02:18:31,920 --> 02:18:36,129
preparations that we're offering well in

3209
02:18:34,030 --> 02:18:37,719
there it is Wade you guys are doing like

3210
02:18:36,129 --> 02:18:40,778
serious like

3211
02:18:37,718 --> 02:18:43,328
real work and then generally wear this

3212
02:18:40,779 --> 02:18:45,699
light-colored things come from has been

3213
02:18:43,328 --> 02:18:47,318
you know partially the experimentation

3214
02:18:45,699 --> 02:18:50,229
once again which is great but also

3215
02:18:47,318 --> 02:18:52,238
through Instagram hype where people just

3216
02:18:50,228 --> 02:18:54,308
naturally seem to think and don't get me

3217
02:18:52,238 --> 02:18:56,379
wrong I'm I give a like every time I see

3218
02:18:54,308 --> 02:18:59,408
any type of hash whether it's light dark

3219
02:18:56,379 --> 02:19:01,538
or in-between sometimes when I have the

3220
02:18:59,408 --> 02:19:03,429
variety I smoke the lighter one first

3221
02:19:01,539 --> 02:19:06,849
and other times I smoke the darker one

3222
02:19:03,429 --> 02:19:09,429
first but I think it's it's part of this

3223
02:19:06,849 --> 02:19:11,408
cannabis thing where in in the long in

3224
02:19:09,429 --> 02:19:14,109
the big picture there's always division

3225
02:19:11,408 --> 02:19:16,840
but what you guys are doing to me is

3226
02:19:14,109 --> 02:19:19,300
separate from all that drama and it's

3227
02:19:16,840 --> 02:19:21,068
it's real it represents a real thing

3228
02:19:19,299 --> 02:19:23,590
which is improving the quality of life

3229
02:19:21,068 --> 02:19:24,988
of young sick children which is vaak

3230
02:19:23,590 --> 02:19:28,299
dude how do you get really than that

3231
02:19:24,988 --> 02:19:32,260
yeah that's that's a special moment

3232
02:19:28,299 --> 02:19:36,488
right there come on yeah well thank you

3233
02:19:32,260 --> 02:19:38,800
for that and we've just I throw it out

3234
02:19:36,488 --> 02:19:40,568
there because there is I see I hear a

3235
02:19:38,799 --> 02:19:42,968
lot of conversation about dis lived and

3236
02:19:40,568 --> 02:19:47,558
clear and how important it is and how

3237
02:19:42,968 --> 02:19:49,629
that's what's got to happen and I yeah I

3238
02:19:47,558 --> 02:19:52,078
kind of just am stuck with this I the

3239
02:19:49,629 --> 02:19:55,448
realization that we see dramatic

3240
02:19:52,078 --> 02:19:57,818
differences between different cultivars

3241
02:19:55,449 --> 02:19:59,498
identical preparation identical

3242
02:19:57,818 --> 02:20:01,689
manufacturing everything's the same

3243
02:19:59,498 --> 02:20:04,029
except the cultivar would start with and

3244
02:20:01,689 --> 02:20:06,189
what we end up with is different because

3245
02:20:04,029 --> 02:20:08,319
the chemistry and that original plant

3246
02:20:06,189 --> 02:20:10,328
was different and we see dramatically

3247
02:20:08,318 --> 02:20:13,719
different results particularly with some

3248
02:20:10,328 --> 02:20:15,908
of the kids with epilepsy it's just

3249
02:20:13,719 --> 02:20:17,618
there's I think at least part of what's

3250
02:20:15,908 --> 02:20:20,020
going on is there's so many things going

3251
02:20:17,619 --> 02:20:23,739
on in the cannabis plant in addition to

3252
02:20:20,020 --> 02:20:25,539
CBD and THC there's other things going

3253
02:20:23,738 --> 02:20:29,318
on and of course the terpenes play a

3254
02:20:25,539 --> 02:20:31,630
huge part in it and because we don't

3255
02:20:29,318 --> 02:20:34,059
know it's what it really boils down to

3256
02:20:31,629 --> 02:20:36,219
because we don't know what's going on

3257
02:20:34,059 --> 02:20:37,868
what we've worked with was what's worked

3258
02:20:36,219 --> 02:20:42,129
in the past and what's worked in the

3259
02:20:37,869 --> 02:20:44,789
past is whole plant feko as I'm told

3260
02:20:42,129 --> 02:20:47,679
it's called full extract cannabis oil

3261
02:20:44,789 --> 02:20:51,529
has a dark color it's somewhat tari

3262
02:20:47,680 --> 02:20:54,109
but it comes when it's clean

3263
02:20:51,529 --> 02:20:57,409
it works that's really what it boils

3264
02:20:54,109 --> 02:21:01,068
down to man we can give a child who's

3265
02:20:57,409 --> 02:21:03,469
seizing the wrong preparation and it's

3266
02:21:01,068 --> 02:21:05,659
nothing that doesn't do anything given

3267
02:21:03,469 --> 02:21:08,449
the right preparation and in 15 or 20

3268
02:21:05,659 --> 02:21:10,430
seconds the seizures stop right which

3269
02:21:08,450 --> 02:21:12,859
now what you just said is is an

3270
02:21:10,430 --> 02:21:15,920
incredible important thing to focus back

3271
02:21:12,859 --> 02:21:18,050
on why the industry might not need as

3272
02:21:15,920 --> 02:21:20,840
much distillate as there is and how it's

3273
02:21:18,049 --> 02:21:23,170
all caught up in saving badly grown and

3274
02:21:20,840 --> 02:21:26,238
poorly you know pesticide managed

3275
02:21:23,170 --> 02:21:28,520
material there's also a value in

3276
02:21:26,238 --> 02:21:31,010
monomolecular in distillation and in

3277
02:21:28,520 --> 02:21:33,470
mono molecular isolation of cannabinoids

3278
02:21:31,010 --> 02:21:35,510
because then the scientists can play

3279
02:21:33,469 --> 02:21:37,369
around and do their experimenting and

3280
02:21:35,510 --> 02:21:39,529
playing around with mechanisms and how

3281
02:21:37,370 --> 02:21:41,180
they work in the brain and figure or

3282
02:21:39,529 --> 02:21:43,880
even simply put figure out a

3283
02:21:41,180 --> 02:21:46,068
formulations where you know you find

3284
02:21:43,879 --> 02:21:47,719
something that works if you can break

3285
02:21:46,068 --> 02:21:50,359
down what that is you're giving them

3286
02:21:47,719 --> 02:21:51,829
into components you can recreate it with

3287
02:21:50,359 --> 02:21:53,840
the same plants doing your own

3288
02:21:51,829 --> 02:21:56,238
extractions making sure that the ratios

3289
02:21:53,840 --> 02:21:59,779
are identical every time because these

3290
02:21:56,238 --> 02:22:01,939
children have such a sensitivity to any

3291
02:21:59,779 --> 02:22:04,010
variation of cannabinoid and terpene

3292
02:22:01,939 --> 02:22:06,380
change that you could create the same

3293
02:22:04,010 --> 02:22:08,359
thing for them every time so now they

3294
02:22:06,379 --> 02:22:09,920
don't ever have to you know worry that

3295
02:22:08,359 --> 02:22:12,470
maybe is this the week that we're gonna

3296
02:22:09,920 --> 02:22:14,329
get medicine that didn't have that same

3297
02:22:12,469 --> 02:22:16,369
yeah that didn't have that same profile

3298
02:22:14,329 --> 02:22:19,459
so I see the value and the importance of

3299
02:22:16,370 --> 02:22:21,590
both of them personally and I just can't

3300
02:22:19,459 --> 02:22:24,199
be divided in that I had the

3301
02:22:21,590 --> 02:22:25,100
conversation I think it was with CC from

3302
02:22:24,200 --> 02:22:27,470
Eden laughs

3303
02:22:25,100 --> 02:22:29,689
she's quite a proponent of full-spectrum

3304
02:22:27,469 --> 02:22:33,079
medicine as well which I am as well I

3305
02:22:29,689 --> 02:22:35,059
just also simultaneously argue for the

3306
02:22:33,079 --> 02:22:39,260
importance of monomolecular isolates and

3307
02:22:35,059 --> 02:22:45,049
and distillates as well there's a full

3308
02:22:39,260 --> 02:22:48,590
spectrum because the clients are not

3309
02:22:45,049 --> 02:22:51,259
really dark in the plant it's when

3310
02:22:48,590 --> 02:22:53,988
they've been degraded from oxygen or

3311
02:22:51,260 --> 02:22:58,790
storage or tea quartier eight years

3312
02:22:53,988 --> 02:23:02,539
that's when they become dark yes I'm not

3313
02:22:58,790 --> 02:23:02,880
saying that a little bit of CBN isn't

3314
02:23:02,540 --> 02:23:05,550
the

3315
02:23:02,879 --> 02:23:08,670
some patients I'm just saying that you

3316
02:23:05,549 --> 02:23:13,889
know both spectrum isn't for everybody

3317
02:23:08,670 --> 02:23:18,869
maybe you know whatever your illnesses

3318
02:23:13,889 --> 02:23:20,189
probably determines what it is exactly

3319
02:23:18,869 --> 02:23:22,350
and it won't just be a full spectrum

3320
02:23:20,189 --> 02:23:25,079
it'll be a version of the full spectrum

3321
02:23:22,350 --> 02:23:27,329
that once was versus the footprints that

3322
02:23:25,079 --> 02:23:29,340
are now present from all of those

3323
02:23:27,329 --> 02:23:31,049
variables and more that Sam just

3324
02:23:29,340 --> 02:23:33,449
mentioned so that's where the value

3325
02:23:31,049 --> 02:23:37,648
comes into play that you know these kids

3326
02:23:33,449 --> 02:23:39,600
they cannot be we need to do that work

3327
02:23:37,648 --> 02:23:41,879
we need to figure out the ratios that

3328
02:23:39,600 --> 02:23:44,939
are right for the right people and then

3329
02:23:41,879 --> 02:23:48,000
to be able to create them cannabis-based

3330
02:23:44,939 --> 02:23:50,430
arrived so not going outside of cannabis

3331
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:52,949
to recreate the profile but creating the

3332
02:23:50,430 --> 02:23:55,020
profile from specific distillation x'

3333
02:23:52,949 --> 02:23:57,420
and isolations that you've created that

3334
02:23:55,020 --> 02:23:59,609
you can now take and put together and

3335
02:23:57,420 --> 02:24:01,978
create exactly what was over here still

3336
02:23:59,609 --> 02:24:04,590
cannabis derived not [ __ ] genetically

3337
02:24:01,978 --> 02:24:09,539
modified plastic weird you know like

3338
02:24:04,590 --> 02:24:12,719
around on whatever yeah breed a variety

3339
02:24:09,540 --> 02:24:15,840
of cannabis for any terpene or any

3340
02:24:12,719 --> 02:24:19,068
cannabinoid excursion and if you brought

3341
02:24:15,840 --> 02:24:21,389
identical conditions every time it'll be

3342
02:24:19,068 --> 02:24:23,549
identical right that's a good point Sam

3343
02:24:21,389 --> 02:24:25,469
and yeah you know that I love this

3344
02:24:23,549 --> 02:24:28,349
conversation because it talks about how

3345
02:24:25,469 --> 02:24:31,260
you know we're demystifying a lot of a

3346
02:24:28,350 --> 02:24:33,988
lot of this opinion and data really is

3347
02:24:31,260 --> 02:24:36,000
as we're kind of talking about it what's

3348
02:24:33,988 --> 02:24:39,448
right for you so individual right now

3349
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:42,090
that we're not even to that point like

3350
02:24:39,449 --> 02:24:44,189
you're talking about Marcus that we are

3351
02:24:42,090 --> 02:24:46,199
able to clearly give someone a roadmap

3352
02:24:44,189 --> 02:24:48,750
to what what an ailment might might need

3353
02:24:46,199 --> 02:24:51,239
for them you know to combat that you

3354
02:24:48,750 --> 02:24:55,529
know like oh this you need X amount of

3355
02:24:51,238 --> 02:24:57,359
CBG and CBD versus with a touch of THC V

3356
02:24:55,529 --> 02:25:01,050
and that's going to be it like we're not

3357
02:24:57,359 --> 02:25:04,590
we're so far from that you know but it's

3358
02:25:01,049 --> 02:25:06,688
it's planting those seeds now to allow

3359
02:25:04,590 --> 02:25:08,728
us to flourish in that way and and to

3360
02:25:06,689 --> 02:25:10,979
really you know get younger minds

3361
02:25:08,728 --> 02:25:13,789
involved in and to take it to that place

3362
02:25:10,978 --> 02:25:16,139
you know in the years to come but it's

3363
02:25:13,790 --> 02:25:16,740
you know I'm Sam I'm sure you've seen

3364
02:25:16,139 --> 02:25:20,369
with

3365
02:25:16,739 --> 02:25:23,670
with we're on your path you know great

3366
02:25:20,370 --> 02:25:25,860
clear oil bad clear oil great brown oil

3367
02:25:23,670 --> 02:25:29,940
and bad brown oil here

3368
02:25:25,860 --> 02:25:31,530
pure THC to my amazement and I found

3369
02:25:29,940 --> 02:25:34,290
this out

3370
02:25:31,530 --> 02:25:38,579
must have been in early 90s they'll

3371
02:25:34,290 --> 02:25:41,760
clear THC is clear it has no color

3372
02:25:38,579 --> 02:25:45,709
whatsoever and it has a sort of a thick

3373
02:25:41,760 --> 02:25:49,079
oily texture kind of like superglue a

3374
02:25:45,709 --> 02:25:53,009
drop of it on your tongue and you rub it

3375
02:25:49,079 --> 02:25:59,459
around it has no smell no taste

3376
02:25:53,010 --> 02:26:03,120
I mean whatsoever it's every cannabis

3377
02:25:59,459 --> 02:26:06,209
product but more concentrated it was and

3378
02:26:03,120 --> 02:26:08,940
always have at least a really bitter

3379
02:26:06,209 --> 02:26:13,019
peppery taste on my tongue wait honey

3380
02:26:08,940 --> 02:26:16,950
oil I see that makes sense now

3381
02:26:13,020 --> 02:26:19,260
pure pata as well that has the same like

3382
02:26:16,950 --> 02:26:20,340
the same weird distinct even though it's

3383
02:26:19,260 --> 02:26:23,010
not suppose to have a taste or smell

3384
02:26:20,340 --> 02:26:23,460
when you when you ignite THC aim just by

3385
02:26:23,010 --> 02:26:25,250
itself

3386
02:26:23,459 --> 02:26:28,649
I've noticed that you get a weird

3387
02:26:25,250 --> 02:26:30,059
distinct like aroma in your mouth and

3388
02:26:28,649 --> 02:26:33,959
taste even though you're not supposed to

3389
02:26:30,059 --> 02:26:35,639
it's just like it's specific to the but

3390
02:26:33,959 --> 02:26:38,489
there's a difference to what you're what

3391
02:26:35,639 --> 02:26:40,349
you're producing probably had like Sam

3392
02:26:38,489 --> 02:26:43,649
you're talking about lab grade tea a

3393
02:26:40,350 --> 02:26:44,819
Cranham yeah there will be the

3394
02:26:43,649 --> 02:26:46,799
difference I would almost guarantee

3395
02:26:44,819 --> 02:26:48,750
would be in the fact that that little

3396
02:26:46,799 --> 02:26:51,719
bit of extra that they're getting out in

3397
02:26:48,750 --> 02:26:53,728
the lab of terpenes of other things like

3398
02:26:51,719 --> 02:26:56,449
Rihanna you know would probably make

3399
02:26:53,728 --> 02:26:58,709
that difference don't currently for sure

3400
02:26:56,450 --> 02:27:01,500
one of the things I'd like to pop in

3401
02:26:58,709 --> 02:27:06,119
here with us I I'm fully in favor of the

3402
02:27:01,500 --> 02:27:09,149
the pursuit of THC and THC a in its

3403
02:27:06,120 --> 02:27:14,460
purest forms I love it very much myself

3404
02:27:09,149 --> 02:27:18,930
for my own use but part of what I was

3405
02:27:14,459 --> 02:27:23,599
trying to say here is that in the search

3406
02:27:18,930 --> 02:27:26,729
for fractions of the plants chemistry

3407
02:27:23,600 --> 02:27:29,430
just putting it out there to not forget

3408
02:27:26,728 --> 02:27:30,510
about or ignore all the other things

3409
02:27:29,430 --> 02:27:33,569
that are going on to the

3410
02:27:30,511 --> 02:27:36,690
in the plant that seemed to have a role

3411
02:27:33,569 --> 02:27:39,539
in health as versus psychoactivity and

3412
02:27:36,690 --> 02:27:42,301
THC of course has a big role in health

3413
02:27:39,540 --> 02:27:44,250
but I think most of a secret for the

3414
02:27:42,300 --> 02:27:45,300
psychoactive experience and there

3415
02:27:44,250 --> 02:27:47,190
nothing wrong with the psychoactive

3416
02:27:45,300 --> 02:27:50,399
experience we all love it very much or

3417
02:27:47,190 --> 02:27:52,591
we wouldn't be here but there are people

3418
02:27:50,399 --> 02:27:55,921
who actually need the cannabis plant and

3419
02:27:52,591 --> 02:27:58,131
as as the leading researchers in this

3420
02:27:55,921 --> 02:28:00,989
work that are actually doing the work I

3421
02:27:58,130 --> 02:28:04,350
just beg you to keep track of those

3422
02:28:00,989 --> 02:28:10,761
other folks that really need this plant

3423
02:28:04,351 --> 02:28:13,200
really needed and sometimes it can make

3424
02:28:10,761 --> 02:28:14,819
let's go about finding them and

3425
02:28:13,200 --> 02:28:18,721
isolating them and making them available

3426
02:28:14,819 --> 02:28:21,181
much like what Marcus was saying but for

3427
02:28:18,720 --> 02:28:23,630
the moment where we're at is yeah we

3428
02:28:21,181 --> 02:28:28,079
mostly work with full extract oils and

3429
02:28:23,630 --> 02:28:30,859
so much praise to all of you and anybody

3430
02:28:28,079 --> 02:28:34,370
that's listening that's done the work of

3431
02:28:30,860 --> 02:28:36,750
finding the right genetics and

3432
02:28:34,370 --> 02:28:38,190
concentrating them and making them

3433
02:28:36,750 --> 02:28:42,181
available to the people who actually

3434
02:28:38,190 --> 02:28:47,431
really need this plant because in fact

3435
02:28:42,181 --> 02:28:50,399
there are many of them and yeah I'm

3436
02:28:47,431 --> 02:28:53,159
gonna stop at that point and it's time

3437
02:28:50,399 --> 02:29:10,470
for me to have a take a bond rip mother

3438
02:28:53,159 --> 02:29:12,989
mother right anyway yeah like I say what

3439
02:29:10,470 --> 02:29:15,600
you guys have done in helping to bring

3440
02:29:12,989 --> 02:29:19,409
the plant into normal relations with the

3441
02:29:15,601 --> 02:29:21,091
world again and in that normalization

3442
02:29:19,409 --> 02:29:23,851
I'm just saying there's some people who

3443
02:29:21,091 --> 02:29:24,569
really do need the plant and let's not

3444
02:29:23,851 --> 02:29:29,721
forget them

3445
02:29:24,569 --> 02:29:29,720
so chopping up don't worry I'm on mute

3446
02:29:29,841 --> 02:29:35,040
well well said Wade as always we

3447
02:29:33,239 --> 02:29:40,671
appreciate hearing from you look at this

3448
02:29:35,040 --> 02:29:40,671
Marty not done yet dr. mark in the house

3449
02:29:41,439 --> 02:29:47,148
listen just give us 25 minutes straight

3450
02:29:44,449 --> 02:29:47,869
of baller chemistry drops and we'll call

3451
02:29:47,148 --> 02:29:51,430
it a day

3452
02:29:47,869 --> 02:29:51,430
I mean you know please I would love that

3453
02:29:51,728 --> 02:30:09,349
how you doing you're back from your

3454
02:29:53,809 --> 02:30:14,049
makeup dammit that means you'll be able

3455
02:30:09,350 --> 02:30:14,050
to close this evening with a reggae song

3456
02:30:15,158 --> 02:30:22,430
beautiful it was good to see you guys it

3457
02:30:20,988 --> 02:30:27,309
was a pleasure talking with everybody

3458
02:30:22,430 --> 02:30:27,309
thank you so much I'm out here scone

3459
02:30:30,488 --> 02:30:35,180
yeah I was wondering I wanted to ask

3460
02:30:32,689 --> 02:30:36,350
mark a question about the THC egg I know

3461
02:30:35,180 --> 02:30:37,189
I've kind of done a little bit of

3462
02:30:36,350 --> 02:30:38,869
research but haven't been able to

3463
02:30:37,189 --> 02:30:40,100
actually talk to um you know an actual

3464
02:30:38,869 --> 02:30:43,790
person who knows what the [ __ ] they're

3465
02:30:40,100 --> 02:30:46,460
talking about as far as a relation point

3466
02:30:43,790 --> 02:30:55,850
of THC a in particular like that

3467
02:30:46,459 --> 02:30:58,608
temperature point yes very slowly of

3468
02:30:55,850 --> 02:31:01,250
course so it's got a you know first

3469
02:30:58,609 --> 02:31:04,449
thing first order rate constant which

3470
02:31:01,250 --> 02:31:07,488
means that the the rate of

3471
02:31:04,449 --> 02:31:10,520
decarboxylation accelerates linearly

3472
02:31:07,488 --> 02:31:14,719
with temperature yeah this is all been

3473
02:31:10,520 --> 02:31:16,130
worked out on a very very couple nice

3474
02:31:14,719 --> 02:31:19,039
papers that are out there in the

3475
02:31:16,129 --> 02:31:21,289
literature but you'll find it like most

3476
02:31:19,040 --> 02:31:32,090
cannabinoids will readily start

3477
02:31:21,290 --> 02:31:34,520
decarboxylated like just oh no go get

3478
02:31:32,090 --> 02:31:38,619
him back we'll get him back or anyone

3479
02:31:34,520 --> 02:31:38,619
who's about to answer we lost you mark

3480
02:31:41,020 --> 02:31:44,840
readily starts occurring right around

3481
02:31:43,219 --> 02:31:47,959
the temperature of boiling water right

3482
02:31:44,840 --> 02:31:50,170
okay so that that's a hundred degrees

3483
02:31:47,959 --> 02:31:53,719
centigrade so if you're up at like about

3484
02:31:50,170 --> 02:31:54,829
110 or 120 you're really going to get

3485
02:31:53,719 --> 02:31:59,829
decarboxylation

3486
02:31:54,829 --> 02:32:02,479
purring but um it it's all a matter of

3487
02:31:59,829 --> 02:32:06,021
you know how long you have to wait right

3488
02:32:02,479 --> 02:32:08,539
yeah so the lower the temperature just

3489
02:32:06,021 --> 02:32:12,739
the longer the process occurs to be

3490
02:32:08,540 --> 02:32:14,590
fully completed gotcha yeah what I

3491
02:32:12,739 --> 02:32:18,979
noticed is that when you start

3492
02:32:14,590 --> 02:32:22,219
decarboxylated especially CBD it kind of

3493
02:32:18,979 --> 02:32:23,959
becomes almost almost like a coke you

3494
02:32:22,219 --> 02:32:26,389
know it'll it'll fizz like a coca-cola

3495
02:32:23,959 --> 02:32:28,699
right you'll just see that co2 come

3496
02:32:26,389 --> 02:32:30,349
bubbling out of solution and there's

3497
02:32:28,700 --> 02:32:34,159
definitely an end point at which it you

3498
02:32:30,350 --> 02:32:38,720
know no longer bubbles and yeah

3499
02:32:34,159 --> 02:32:40,700
connector visual point right so in that

3500
02:32:38,719 --> 02:32:42,739
case then if it don't bubble it ain't

3501
02:32:40,700 --> 02:32:45,890
worth the trouble is the same for the

3502
02:32:42,739 --> 02:32:52,190
decarboxylation of CBD a as it is for

3503
02:32:45,889 --> 02:32:54,409
full melt hashes that's gonna be my next

3504
02:32:52,190 --> 02:32:57,440
experiment is trying to isolate the CBD

3505
02:32:54,409 --> 02:32:59,420
CBD a I haven't seen too many people try

3506
02:32:57,440 --> 02:33:01,340
to do that was obviously it's it's not

3507
02:32:59,420 --> 02:33:03,409
too many people make CBD rosin or

3508
02:33:01,340 --> 02:33:05,630
solving this but I think that's gonna be

3509
02:33:03,409 --> 02:33:08,600
my next experiment is trying to isolate

3510
02:33:05,629 --> 02:33:11,179
CBD rosin and then isolate the CBD a out

3511
02:33:08,600 --> 02:33:17,659
of that I'm curious if it'll crystallize

3512
02:33:11,180 --> 02:33:20,090
the same way the thta does is a lot more

3513
02:33:17,659 --> 02:33:23,389
SAP here I think Mike's got something to

3514
02:33:20,090 --> 02:33:25,880
say on the subject my quest yeah so dr.

3515
02:33:23,389 --> 02:33:28,219
mark we were talking earlier about I

3516
02:33:25,879 --> 02:33:30,739
guess fractional extrusion of the

3517
02:33:28,219 --> 02:33:34,670
terpene fractions out of rosin using

3518
02:33:30,739 --> 02:33:37,729
repressing yeah that's cool so a lot of

3519
02:33:34,670 --> 02:33:39,260
that would tends to happen obviously we

3520
02:33:37,729 --> 02:33:42,649
would want when you're when extruding

3521
02:33:39,260 --> 02:33:44,780
the terpene fraction out of the rosin

3522
02:33:42,649 --> 02:33:48,789
that was pressed the first time you're

3523
02:33:44,780 --> 02:33:52,940
probably going to want to keep the

3524
02:33:48,790 --> 02:33:56,570
plates on the top of rosin press below

3525
02:33:52,940 --> 02:33:59,930
the melting point of the THC or CBD a oh

3526
02:33:56,569 --> 02:34:01,399
of course right and then you know is it

3527
02:33:59,930 --> 02:34:02,870
so mark I would ask you is the

3528
02:34:01,399 --> 02:34:05,109
difference in temperature that great

3529
02:34:02,870 --> 02:34:08,681
that you could actually

3530
02:34:05,110 --> 02:34:11,079
actionaid out the CBD a I know I'm I

3531
02:34:08,681 --> 02:34:14,021
primarily fractionating with chemistry

3532
02:34:11,079 --> 02:34:16,239
or yeah I I

3533
02:34:14,021 --> 02:34:17,771
I don't think so Mike I think again

3534
02:34:16,239 --> 02:34:20,949
those things are gonna move around the

3535
02:34:17,771 --> 02:34:24,940
same speed and I I'm not sure that you

3536
02:34:20,950 --> 02:34:27,670
can fraction eight in in like a thermal

3537
02:34:24,940 --> 02:34:30,221
extrusion kinda way but it's an

3538
02:34:27,670 --> 02:34:32,170
interesting thought because obviously I

3539
02:34:30,220 --> 02:34:34,029
mean these things are just due to

3540
02:34:32,170 --> 02:34:36,879
different chemical species so they

3541
02:34:34,030 --> 02:34:39,931
behave very very differently and I think

3542
02:34:36,879 --> 02:34:42,970
like our our theory that we long ago

3543
02:34:39,931 --> 02:34:46,511
proposed on past church which is that

3544
02:34:42,970 --> 02:34:48,819
there's some sort of steam involvement

3545
02:34:46,511 --> 02:34:51,610
the involvement of the moisture that's

3546
02:34:48,819 --> 02:34:55,079
in the material itself that has nowhere

3547
02:34:51,610 --> 02:34:57,101
to go but out is part of the the

3548
02:34:55,079 --> 02:35:00,399
thermodynamic driving force for

3549
02:34:57,101 --> 02:35:02,980
basically moving the oil away from the

3550
02:35:00,399 --> 02:35:07,359
plant material right just like the same

3551
02:35:02,979 --> 02:35:08,859
way that you know waters or water builds

3552
02:35:07,360 --> 02:35:11,290
up underneath the tire when you hide

3553
02:35:08,860 --> 02:35:13,000
your plane and there's nowhere for the

3554
02:35:11,290 --> 02:35:16,391
car to go but just sort of in a

3555
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:18,360
longitudinal direction so yeah I would

3556
02:35:16,390 --> 02:35:21,789
really think that again part of that

3557
02:35:18,360 --> 02:35:24,310
could be a fractionation mechanism where

3558
02:35:21,790 --> 02:35:26,530
maybe what you do is you're getting in

3559
02:35:24,310 --> 02:35:27,220
the leading front the more volatile

3560
02:35:26,530 --> 02:35:29,591
component

3561
02:35:27,220 --> 02:35:33,279
I think the difference between THC and

3562
02:35:29,591 --> 02:35:35,771
CBD a TNC a and CBD a is still about you

3563
02:35:33,280 --> 02:35:39,761
know 10 or 15 degrees but you know I

3564
02:35:35,771 --> 02:35:45,370
think that you could potentially maybe

3565
02:35:39,761 --> 02:35:49,060
leave leave leave the THC or I'm sorry

3566
02:35:45,370 --> 02:35:51,851
leave the CBD a behind and push the THC

3567
02:35:49,060 --> 02:35:53,770
out you know but I don't know that

3568
02:35:51,851 --> 02:35:57,431
anyone's actually done that or just use

3569
02:35:53,771 --> 02:35:59,320
a CBD cultivar that has almost no THC in

3570
02:35:57,431 --> 02:36:01,030
it like a penny wise or chair you want

3571
02:35:59,319 --> 02:36:03,489
your shot my cup exactly

3572
02:36:01,030 --> 02:36:05,471
yeah that's wrong yeah there's a lot of

3573
02:36:03,489 --> 02:36:09,069
people thinking about how do you make

3574
02:36:05,470 --> 02:36:11,439
those those oils less hot because that

3575
02:36:09,069 --> 02:36:16,149
that hotness you know again the dirty

3576
02:36:11,440 --> 02:36:18,069
secret is as yeah you have 0.3% THC or

3577
02:36:16,149 --> 02:36:18,430
below in the plant but as soon as you

3578
02:36:18,069 --> 02:36:21,909
can

3579
02:36:18,430 --> 02:36:24,340
trade that oil correct goes through the

3580
02:36:21,909 --> 02:36:26,318
roof so there's a lot of people who are

3581
02:36:24,340 --> 02:36:28,840
trying to fix this this out

3582
02:36:26,318 --> 02:36:31,198
chromatography certainly works because

3583
02:36:28,840 --> 02:36:34,148
the difference in the polarity between

3584
02:36:31,199 --> 02:36:38,859
CBD a and THC a is sufficient enough

3585
02:36:34,148 --> 02:36:41,738
that you can get decent separation on

3586
02:36:38,859 --> 02:36:44,500
preparators promet ography so that seems

3587
02:36:41,738 --> 02:36:47,250
to be the way right now I thought what

3588
02:36:44,500 --> 02:36:51,430
we'd find is that you could somehow

3589
02:36:47,250 --> 02:36:54,040
crystallize the THC a and leave the CBD

3590
02:36:51,430 --> 02:37:00,898
a behind but that doesn't seem to work

3591
02:36:54,040 --> 02:37:04,090
out too well because I'm sorry

3592
02:37:00,898 --> 02:37:06,369
CBD prefers to Krista form crystals as

3593
02:37:04,090 --> 02:37:10,449
opposed to THC in an out pain

3594
02:37:06,370 --> 02:37:13,000
well CBD a is also a crystalline solid

3595
02:37:10,449 --> 02:37:16,060
but it's less crystalline than I think

3596
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:18,639
THC a and I think part of the reason why

3597
02:37:16,059 --> 02:37:21,369
is because there's you know a rotational

3598
02:37:18,639 --> 02:37:24,340
degree of freedom in CBD a because

3599
02:37:21,370 --> 02:37:25,870
you've you unstitched that third that

3600
02:37:24,340 --> 02:37:28,439
the third ring right it's not a

3601
02:37:25,870 --> 02:37:30,660
tricyclic structure it's only a

3602
02:37:28,439 --> 02:37:33,189
bicycling structure and there's

3603
02:37:30,659 --> 02:37:35,439
rotational degrees of freedom there that

3604
02:37:33,189 --> 02:37:37,659
again makes it a little bit more

3605
02:37:35,439 --> 02:37:40,659
orderers to crystallize what's the

3606
02:37:37,659 --> 02:37:43,359
matter wondering at lower temperature if

3607
02:37:40,659 --> 02:37:45,959
you be able to make that make that crash

3608
02:37:43,359 --> 02:37:47,949
so to speak under mechanical separation

3609
02:37:45,959 --> 02:37:51,829
versus like a higher temperature with

3610
02:37:47,949 --> 02:37:57,880
thta or thermal extrusion as Mark put it

3611
02:37:51,829 --> 02:37:57,879
[Laughter]

3612
02:37:58,590 --> 02:38:15,818
love it I'm using it new hashtag to come

3613
02:38:12,909 --> 02:38:19,510
up with a scientific term and what we

3614
02:38:15,818 --> 02:38:26,198
chose was thermal thermal extrusion

3615
02:38:19,510 --> 02:38:28,420
under pressure that's awesome what of

3616
02:38:26,199 --> 02:38:29,760
the pure pressure units I think they got

3617
02:38:28,420 --> 02:38:31,899
it right away

3618
02:38:29,760 --> 02:38:37,200
making rosin

3619
02:38:31,899 --> 02:38:37,199
nice copyrighted but we should call it

3620
02:38:38,280 --> 02:38:43,480
stick I want to make sure everybody

3621
02:38:41,889 --> 02:38:45,789
knows too with the mechanical separation

3622
02:38:43,479 --> 02:38:48,459
that at least with my process I never go

3623
02:38:45,790 --> 02:38:50,710
above 200 Gries Fahrenheit ever very

3624
02:38:48,459 --> 02:38:52,569
very very rarely except for my final

3625
02:38:50,709 --> 02:38:55,149
cleanup presses when there's absolutely

3626
02:38:52,569 --> 02:38:57,851
no Terps left in the in the pouch I'll

3627
02:38:55,149 --> 02:39:01,000
do make my final steps which I didn't

3628
02:38:57,851 --> 02:39:03,069
happen to mention we're using a paper or

3629
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:06,280
a coffee filter organic coffee filter

3630
02:39:03,069 --> 02:39:08,469
wrapped around the mesh of the thca and

3631
02:39:06,280 --> 02:39:10,540
I'll be around 180 to 190 doing really

3632
02:39:08,469 --> 02:39:12,579
short hard presses at that point to

3633
02:39:10,540 --> 02:39:15,851
exclude any leftover Terps that are

3634
02:39:12,579 --> 02:39:18,819
still present but I very rarely allow

3635
02:39:15,851 --> 02:39:21,579
the Terp fraction to ever get close to

3636
02:39:18,819 --> 02:39:23,770
that 150 Fahrenheit or higher thank you

3637
02:39:21,579 --> 02:39:25,659
you were just experimenting seeing it

3638
02:39:23,771 --> 02:39:27,250
get wider and wider as you pulled it out

3639
02:39:25,659 --> 02:39:31,119
knowing that what you were doing made

3640
02:39:27,250 --> 02:39:32,799
sense yep the indication because I use

3641
02:39:31,120 --> 02:39:34,660
the organic Brown coffee filters so

3642
02:39:32,799 --> 02:39:35,739
that's indication when you first put it

3643
02:39:34,659 --> 02:39:38,229
in there you're starting your clean up

3644
02:39:35,739 --> 02:39:39,940
presses that'll be really it'll look wet

3645
02:39:38,229 --> 02:39:42,430
quote-unquote like it'll look like it's

3646
02:39:39,940 --> 02:39:43,780
it's had liquid on it and you removed

3647
02:39:42,430 --> 02:39:46,000
that you replace that and repeat the

3648
02:39:43,780 --> 02:39:47,590
process it'll let it'll look less wet

3649
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:49,000
less wet and then get to the point where

3650
02:39:47,590 --> 02:39:50,950
there's absolutely nothing left on the

3651
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:53,889
mikado filter then you'd many know

3652
02:39:50,950 --> 02:39:58,601
you've you've excluded the Terps as far

3653
02:39:53,889 --> 02:40:00,549
as you can essentially a good point as

3654
02:39:58,601 --> 02:40:02,470
far as temperature wise and I try to

3655
02:40:00,549 --> 02:40:04,539
make sure that I people know that you

3656
02:40:02,469 --> 02:40:07,079
don't ever need to get over you know 200

3657
02:40:04,540 --> 02:40:14,140
degrees Fahrenheit ever for this process

3658
02:40:07,079 --> 02:40:15,851
you start agrees yeah as you go as the

3659
02:40:14,139 --> 02:40:18,430
time the six hour period

3660
02:40:15,851 --> 02:40:22,030
you take the temperatures up how much

3661
02:40:18,430 --> 02:40:24,610
intervals up to that temperature it's

3662
02:40:22,030 --> 02:40:26,380
like I said the initial press is about

3663
02:40:24,610 --> 02:40:29,319
every half hour I'll bump it up and I

3664
02:40:26,379 --> 02:40:31,779
use my my machines in Celsius it's not

3665
02:40:29,319 --> 02:40:35,529
in Fahrenheit but I bump up even those

3666
02:40:31,780 --> 02:40:37,239
numbers from like 40 to 45 and about 90

3667
02:40:35,530 --> 02:40:39,280
minutes and then after that it's about

3668
02:40:37,239 --> 02:40:41,229
every 20 or 30 minutes I bump it up a

3669
02:40:39,280 --> 02:40:45,070
couple degrees each time until I get to

3670
02:40:41,229 --> 02:40:45,340
about that point that it's around 170 to

3671
02:40:45,069 --> 02:40:47,409
1

3672
02:40:45,340 --> 02:40:49,569
eighty Fahrenheit I try to never repress

3673
02:40:47,409 --> 02:40:51,670
my rosin higher than what I pressed it

3674
02:40:49,569 --> 02:40:54,459
initially if that makes sense so you you

3675
02:40:51,670 --> 02:40:56,260
rockin Celsius down in Cali I bought my

3676
02:40:54,459 --> 02:41:01,299
plates from lid extraction in Canada and

3677
02:40:56,260 --> 02:41:02,950
they [ __ ] hilarious do you're like the

3678
02:41:01,299 --> 02:41:07,389
one American you like I don't what it

3679
02:41:02,950 --> 02:41:08,740
means I'm still working on it I have a

3680
02:41:07,389 --> 02:41:10,779
graph sit next to my press the whole

3681
02:41:08,739 --> 02:41:15,879
time every time I use it oh my god

3682
02:41:10,780 --> 02:41:23,079
because I should skin' fusing presses

3683
02:41:15,879 --> 02:41:26,889
are you the temperature change is just

3684
02:41:23,079 --> 02:41:29,590
to to to slowly like initially just to

3685
02:41:26,889 --> 02:41:31,779
allow the th da to crash or convert into

3686
02:41:29,590 --> 02:41:33,520
crystal form and then after that is more

3687
02:41:31,780 --> 02:41:35,229
of a more of a flow thing the hotter the

3688
02:41:33,520 --> 02:41:37,239
plates get the more the oil becomes

3689
02:41:35,228 --> 02:41:39,879
hotter and more and more flowable so to

3690
02:41:37,239 --> 02:41:46,299
speak so that's the only reason for the

3691
02:41:39,879 --> 02:41:49,029
temperature change I'm wondering oh yeah

3692
02:41:46,299 --> 02:41:51,519
definitely those because I'm here mark

3693
02:41:49,030 --> 02:41:54,159
can it can tell us I the most of all to

3694
02:41:51,520 --> 02:41:57,430
terpenes for an offer like 70 65 cm

3695
02:41:54,159 --> 02:42:00,010
we're night yeah so they're already gone

3696
02:41:57,430 --> 02:42:03,220
by the time you're you're done or you're

3697
02:42:00,010 --> 02:42:05,040
in this process what's pressing out at

3698
02:42:03,219 --> 02:42:09,239
that temperature is probably

3699
02:42:05,040 --> 02:42:16,359
monoglycerides yeah other plans

3700
02:42:09,239 --> 02:42:19,539
c5 yeah wouldn't bail for sure telling

3701
02:42:16,359 --> 02:42:23,260
it right it takes to isoprenes to make

3702
02:42:19,540 --> 02:42:27,250
one monitor right so I see five and

3703
02:42:23,260 --> 02:42:30,340
terpene is c10 and again yeah mercy and

3704
02:42:27,250 --> 02:42:33,540
oh so mean and some of those real very

3705
02:42:30,340 --> 02:42:37,030
sensitive Olive volatile monoterpenes or

3706
02:42:33,540 --> 02:42:38,979
probably undergoing some kind of you

3707
02:42:37,030 --> 02:42:41,620
know thermal degradation reaction but

3708
02:42:38,978 --> 02:42:44,170
definitely volatilizing you probably are

3709
02:42:41,620 --> 02:42:45,010
almost guaranteed guaranteed degradation

3710
02:42:44,170 --> 02:42:48,969
for sure

3711
02:42:45,010 --> 02:42:53,010
I mean let's be real yeah yeah well I

3712
02:42:48,969 --> 02:42:55,629
think that's what the the popcorn flavor

3713
02:42:53,010 --> 02:42:58,139
now you know what I'll say that I've

3714
02:42:55,629 --> 02:43:00,028
only remember when the rosin

3715
02:42:58,139 --> 02:43:01,769
came out and I was like taking pictures

3716
02:43:00,029 --> 02:43:03,420
and sharing it people like oh yeah burnt

3717
02:43:01,770 --> 02:43:05,729
popcorn I was like what are these people

3718
02:43:03,420 --> 02:43:07,079
talking about burnt popcorn I've smoked

3719
02:43:05,728 --> 02:43:09,568
a lot of Roz and I haven't smoked any

3720
02:43:07,079 --> 02:43:11,398
burnt popcorn and it wasn't and it

3721
02:43:09,568 --> 02:43:13,528
wasn't until I think it might have been

3722
02:43:11,398 --> 02:43:14,789
that [ __ ] press you did accidentally

3723
02:43:13,529 --> 02:43:17,250
Darren when we did the Celsius

3724
02:43:14,790 --> 02:43:19,170
Fahrenheit mistake which was what I

3725
02:43:17,250 --> 02:43:21,750
laughed about earlier when Darren was

3726
02:43:19,170 --> 02:43:23,639
asking about temperatures because I'll

3727
02:43:21,750 --> 02:43:25,920
never forget this is the thing about

3728
02:43:23,639 --> 02:43:30,090
Celsius and Fahrenheit it's as confusing

3729
02:43:25,920 --> 02:43:31,949
as [ __ ] it's fun I get my press from an

3730
02:43:30,090 --> 02:43:33,870
American company and it's in Fahrenheit

3731
02:43:31,949 --> 02:43:37,859
so when he asks me hey what temperature

3732
02:43:33,870 --> 02:43:41,340
you doing that I'm like I'm like oh like

3733
02:43:37,859 --> 02:43:44,100
200 or whatever like 198 210 and so he

3734
02:43:41,340 --> 02:43:46,020
slaps this thing into Celsius and [ __ ]

3735
02:43:44,100 --> 02:43:48,390
it goes up to 220 we'll do it I almost

3736
02:43:46,020 --> 02:43:51,500
pissed myself it was spitting rosin out

3737
02:43:48,389 --> 02:43:55,349
like he said it was on his shoes it was

3738
02:43:51,500 --> 02:43:56,908
[ __ ] dirt dude I'm telling you we had

3739
02:43:55,350 --> 02:43:58,470
a [ __ ] good laugh about that there

3740
02:43:56,908 --> 02:44:01,379
and although that sucked in the sense

3741
02:43:58,469 --> 02:44:03,420
that that was the [ __ ] a lot of nice

3742
02:44:01,379 --> 02:44:05,369
beautiful product there got ruined but

3743
02:44:03,420 --> 02:44:08,370
once again experimenting right you gotta

3744
02:44:05,370 --> 02:44:12,779
learn this [ __ ] I felt bad actually

3745
02:44:08,370 --> 02:44:16,350
following instructions exactly totally

3746
02:44:12,779 --> 02:44:19,680
did my kid my little gold pearl the lens

3747
02:44:16,350 --> 02:44:24,870
that the holder everything was all

3748
02:44:19,680 --> 02:44:28,648
covered in Raza my shirt the same [ __ ]

3749
02:44:24,870 --> 02:44:31,109
same [ __ ] oh yeah you did that too I

3750
02:44:28,648 --> 02:44:33,809
wanna press I bought this shitty ass a

3751
02:44:31,109 --> 02:44:35,040
PID controller that ended up being like

3752
02:44:33,809 --> 02:44:37,680
I was pressing it to in a degrees

3753
02:44:35,040 --> 02:44:39,899
Fahrenheit but in reality the peas were

3754
02:44:37,680 --> 02:44:42,359
were pressing almost at 300 degrees

3755
02:44:39,898 --> 02:44:44,728
Fahrenheit and I didn't it was not

3756
02:44:42,359 --> 02:44:46,318
saying that on on the actual readout so

3757
02:44:44,728 --> 02:44:48,929
I had no [ __ ] clue we went to go

3758
02:44:46,318 --> 02:44:50,639
press a half a zip of hatch and sure

3759
02:44:48,930 --> 02:44:53,729
enough it just started spitting all over

3760
02:44:50,639 --> 02:44:55,559
the place the very first press and my

3761
02:44:53,728 --> 02:44:57,269
buddy my it was who was gonna be my

3762
02:44:55,559 --> 02:44:58,978
partner in this literally that day said

3763
02:44:57,270 --> 02:45:03,449
nope and then I'm not doing this sake he

3764
02:44:58,978 --> 02:45:05,840
was over it just like two two and a half

3765
02:45:03,449 --> 02:45:05,840
years ago

3766
02:45:06,389 --> 02:45:15,869
some bad pork I had a Van de Graaff

3767
02:45:12,930 --> 02:45:18,270
generator I purchased two full-sized Van

3768
02:45:15,870 --> 02:45:20,090
de Graaff generator not a big giant one

3769
02:45:18,270 --> 02:45:23,250
but it was about three feet tall

3770
02:45:20,090 --> 02:45:26,219
I turned it on and poured a hundred

3771
02:45:23,250 --> 02:45:30,540
grams of resin on top of it to see what

3772
02:45:26,219 --> 02:45:33,929
would happen and it charged and flung

3773
02:45:30,540 --> 02:45:50,750
itself and stuck to all of the walls in

3774
02:45:33,930 --> 02:45:50,750
the whole office a hundred grams oh yeah

3775
02:45:51,139 --> 02:45:56,969
yeah yeah for sure I get you but still

3776
02:45:54,389 --> 02:45:58,500
now it's like [ __ ] I wish I had that

3777
02:45:56,969 --> 02:46:02,039
hundred grams that's all over the walls

3778
02:45:58,500 --> 02:46:05,309
my office right now that was like a

3779
02:46:02,040 --> 02:46:08,460
friend one of my longtime friends Ron

3780
02:46:05,309 --> 02:46:11,189
Hickey he had gotten disliked I think it

3781
02:46:08,459 --> 02:46:13,619
was like a kilo or two of this like red

3782
02:46:11,189 --> 02:46:15,238
oil and I can't remember where it was

3783
02:46:13,620 --> 02:46:18,120
from like India or something made with

3784
02:46:15,238 --> 02:46:20,698
hash and so he it was I guess the guy

3785
02:46:18,120 --> 02:46:22,620
wore it in like a it was squished in hot

3786
02:46:20,699 --> 02:46:24,960
into a plastic thing that went around

3787
02:46:22,620 --> 02:46:28,680
his body or something and so they had it

3788
02:46:24,959 --> 02:46:30,478
they froze it and then they opened the

3789
02:46:28,680 --> 02:46:32,398
thing and they had this oil and they

3790
02:46:30,478 --> 02:46:35,398
were trying to they wanted to put it in

3791
02:46:32,398 --> 02:46:36,809
a bowl but the bowl was too small it was

3792
02:46:35,398 --> 02:46:39,059
the biggest bowl they had so they kind

3793
02:46:36,809 --> 02:46:41,100
of they kind of were bending it just a

3794
02:46:39,059 --> 02:46:44,930
little bit and as they were doing that

3795
02:46:41,100 --> 02:46:48,300
it shattered and he said there was oil

3796
02:46:44,930 --> 02:46:50,818
everywhere like all over his kitchen

3797
02:46:48,299 --> 02:46:52,978
everywhere on every sing under neath of

3798
02:46:50,818 --> 02:46:56,250
his table got some on it he has no idea

3799
02:46:52,978 --> 02:46:58,260
how but that was that made me laugh to

3800
02:46:56,250 --> 02:47:03,809
like some of these mistakes we do holy

3801
02:46:58,260 --> 02:47:07,620
[ __ ] Marcus I wanted to tell you the

3802
02:47:03,809 --> 02:47:14,850
dispensary called Chaya Jamaica oh yes I

3803
02:47:07,620 --> 02:47:16,800
know the people yes and that's what they

3804
02:47:14,850 --> 02:47:19,620
were doing they were giving out dabs of

3805
02:47:16,799 --> 02:47:21,799
we're not giving them but selling absent

3806

basically put in an extraction lab but

3830
02:48:36,899 --> 02:48:40,170
we're sort of still in the works of that

3831
02:48:38,670 --> 02:48:40,681
but I'll keep you posted on what's going

3832
02:48:40,170 --> 02:48:43,021
on there

3833
02:48:40,681 --> 02:48:44,940
beautiful well we're still we want to

3834
02:48:43,021 --> 02:48:49,110
talk to you up here in Canada eventually

3835
02:48:44,940 --> 02:48:51,060
here as well hey bring me up ready

3836
02:48:49,110 --> 02:48:52,650
willing and able well we'll start with a

3837
02:48:51,060 --> 02:48:54,959
conversation for sure but we definitely

3838
02:48:52,649 --> 02:48:57,629
want to you know you know Mike's working

3839
02:48:54,959 --> 02:48:59,459
with me on the embark project right

3840
02:48:57,629 --> 02:49:00,989
right right right

3841
02:48:59,459 --> 02:49:03,390
we both had a talk I'm definitely

3842
02:49:00,989 --> 02:49:05,090
getting dr. mark up here for a

3843
02:49:03,390 --> 02:49:15,569
conversation

3844
02:49:05,090 --> 02:49:18,810
I got a room set aside so fume hood

3845
02:49:15,569 --> 02:49:22,261
glovebox refluxing roto anything

3846
02:49:18,810 --> 02:49:24,840
anything else I guess we can talk out

3847
02:49:22,261 --> 02:49:30,560
otherwise yeah let's let's let's talk

3848
02:49:24,840 --> 02:49:30,560
offline yeah totally

3849
02:49:34,578 --> 02:49:43,680
Natacha invited me to I guess the Zen

3850
02:49:39,029 --> 02:49:47,609
abyss Canadian chemical society is I

3851
02:49:43,680 --> 02:49:51,020
guess having now a session on cannabis I

3852
02:49:47,609 --> 02:49:54,029
think in Toronto or are you sure in

3853
02:49:51,020 --> 02:49:57,658
Quebec City I'd believe a carcass I

3854
02:49:54,029 --> 02:49:59,430
think it's um in June sometime but again

3855
02:49:57,658 --> 02:50:04,379
the fact that they're actually having a

3856
02:49:59,430 --> 02:50:07,289
conversation about it is is is really

3857
02:50:04,379 --> 02:50:10,738
cool yeah might be what worth us heading

3858
02:50:07,289 --> 02:50:13,260
down there to Mike yeah I mean we need

3859
02:50:10,738 --> 02:50:16,439
to have more opportunity for chemists in

3860
02:50:13,260 --> 02:50:18,600
this industry and you know the fact that

3861
02:50:16,439 --> 02:50:21,449
the American Chemical Society and now

3862
02:50:18,600 --> 02:50:22,890
the Canadian Chemical Society are paying

3863
02:50:21,449 --> 02:50:25,859
attention to this I think is pretty

3864
02:50:22,889 --> 02:50:28,769
substantial because these chemical

3865
02:50:25,859 --> 02:50:31,109
societies are the ones that basically

3866
02:50:28,770 --> 02:50:33,090
author or not author but they're the

3867
02:50:31,109 --> 02:50:34,828
ones that basically publish research

3868
02:50:33,090 --> 02:50:37,260
journals and those are the kind of

3869
02:50:34,828 --> 02:50:39,719
research journals that are going to give

3870
02:50:37,260 --> 02:50:45,590
credibility to some of the Rd that's

3871
02:50:39,719 --> 02:50:50,549
going on in the industry so the now Sam

3872
02:50:45,590 --> 02:50:53,248
grouper there so I was asked to speak at

3873
02:50:50,549 --> 02:50:56,068
a group of what was it National

3874
02:50:53,248 --> 02:51:00,208
Association of scientific materials

3875
02:50:56,068 --> 02:51:02,818
antigen and it's all the material man

3876
02:51:00,209 --> 02:51:05,699
lab chem departments and bio departments

3877
02:51:02,818 --> 02:51:08,879
at different universities because

3878
02:51:05,699 --> 02:51:12,029
there's a lot of interest at those

3879
02:51:08,879 --> 02:51:15,418
universities to start doing research but

3880
02:51:12,029 --> 02:51:17,760
you know a lot of the researchers aren't

3881
02:51:15,418 --> 02:51:25,469
able to do the research on campus

3882
02:51:17,760 --> 02:51:27,389
because of the federal IND issues so

3883
02:51:25,469 --> 02:51:29,188
yeah I've worked with a couple of

3884
02:51:27,389 --> 02:51:33,389
companies that have applied to supply

3885
02:51:29,189 --> 02:51:37,498
NIDA but until the DEA starts actually

3886
02:51:33,389 --> 02:51:39,629
issuing licenses issuing licenses the

3887
02:51:37,498 --> 02:51:41,578
supply is kind of limited so a lot of

3888
02:51:39,629 --> 02:51:47,108
the University researchers are actually

3889
02:51:41,578 --> 02:51:51,248
doing research with independent labs but

3890
02:51:47,109 --> 02:51:54,998
there's I mean as as federal law changes

3891
02:51:51,248 --> 02:51:57,850
in as law as places abroad allow that

3892
02:51:54,998 --> 02:51:59,850
[ __ ] we're gonna be able to do research

3893
02:51:57,850 --> 02:52:04,350
at uni levels be able to create

3894
02:51:59,850 --> 02:52:07,328
formulated cannabinoid stuff for

3895
02:52:04,350 --> 02:52:10,050
double-blind placebo trials right now we

3896
02:52:07,328 --> 02:52:13,299
unfortunately have to do that abroad but

3897
02:52:10,049 --> 02:52:16,748
as laws change we will uh be doing that

3898
02:52:13,299 --> 02:52:18,759
research across the US as well well

3899
02:52:16,748 --> 02:52:21,340
fortunately I'm even we know how

3900
02:52:18,760 --> 02:52:23,738
biologically significant these molecules

3901
02:52:21,340 --> 02:52:26,199
are so the cards are stacked in our

3902
02:52:23,738 --> 02:52:27,878
favor because you know all these

3903
02:52:26,199 --> 02:52:29,890
diseases that are mediated by the

3904
02:52:27,879 --> 02:52:33,100
endocannabinoids system I mean these

3905
02:52:29,889 --> 02:52:35,430
compounds are all really important you

3906
02:52:33,100 --> 02:52:39,220
know in treating those diseases and so

3907
02:52:35,430 --> 02:52:42,248
yeah I mean question is is you know

3908
02:52:39,219 --> 02:52:44,078
where do you start right you know and

3909
02:52:42,248 --> 02:52:46,449
when the National Institute of Health

3910
02:52:44,078 --> 02:52:49,180
comes out and says that all human

3911
02:52:46,449 --> 02:52:51,449
disease is basically somehow underpinner

3912
02:52:49,180 --> 02:52:53,559
connected to the endocannabinoids system

3913
02:52:51,449 --> 02:52:55,619
you figure that would give the

3914
02:52:53,559 --> 02:52:59,498
pharmaceutical companies a big woody

3915
02:52:55,619 --> 02:53:01,300
instead you know they're basically again

3916
02:52:59,498 --> 02:53:03,760
trying to do the end-around on the plant

3917
02:53:01,299 --> 02:53:05,978
and trying to guess you know what are

3918
02:53:03,760 --> 02:53:09,398
the best molecules that they can patent

3919
02:53:05,978 --> 02:53:11,648
to basically elicit the same you know

3920
02:53:09,398 --> 02:53:14,799
effects that we see with the plant

3921
02:53:11,648 --> 02:53:16,180
derived molecule so you know I mean

3922
02:53:14,799 --> 02:53:19,299
cannabis we've said it before is a

3923
02:53:16,180 --> 02:53:22,600
medicated plant it's not a drug and so

3924
02:53:19,299 --> 02:53:24,549
it needs to be regulated as such and you

3925
02:53:22,600 --> 02:53:26,890
know all this ideas about you know

3926
02:53:24,549 --> 02:53:30,639
what's going on with the with the

3927
02:53:26,889 --> 02:53:34,168
epidemics and the CBD industry I think a

3928
02:53:30,639 --> 02:53:36,818
lot of people are really fed up with the

3929
02:53:34,168 --> 02:53:39,668
double standard that exists in the US

3930
02:53:36,818 --> 02:53:43,180
regulation and they're putting pressure

3931
02:53:39,668 --> 02:53:44,590
on their Congress members today I just

3932
02:53:43,180 --> 02:53:47,199
read a letter the other day that

3933
02:53:44,590 --> 02:53:49,658
basically is being sent to the FDA by

3934
02:53:47,199 --> 02:53:51,520
several key members of Congress telling

3935
02:53:49,658 --> 02:53:54,668
them to get their [ __ ] [ __ ] together

3936
02:53:51,520 --> 02:53:56,529
and stop being so vague and so ambiguous

3937
02:53:54,668 --> 02:53:58,328
when it comes to the regulation of

3938
02:53:56,529 --> 02:54:00,100
what's being allowed and what's not

3939
02:53:58,328 --> 02:54:00,979
being allowed because it creates a lot

3940
02:54:00,100 --> 02:54:03,560
of uncertain

3941
02:54:00,979 --> 02:54:05,841
and risk for those who are trying to get

3942
02:54:03,560 --> 02:54:09,261
into the industry everybody from a

3943
02:54:05,841 --> 02:54:12,050
mom-and-pop little artisan CBD product

3944
02:54:09,261 --> 02:54:15,110
to you know your multinationals who are

3945
02:54:12,050 --> 02:54:17,149
trying to do you know really big

3946
02:54:15,110 --> 02:54:19,761
billion-dollar plays in the industry I

3947
02:54:17,149 --> 02:54:22,130
think there's room for everybody but the

3948
02:54:19,761 --> 02:54:24,470
the government needs to get the [ __ ] out

3949
02:54:22,130 --> 02:54:26,510
of the way because right now they're

3950
02:54:24,470 --> 02:54:29,421
just causing a lot of uncertainty and a

3951
02:54:26,511 --> 02:54:32,540
lot of speculation on how they're gonna

3952
02:54:29,421 --> 02:54:35,239
come down on this well and here's what I

3953
02:54:32,540 --> 02:54:38,051
think is gonna happen yeah well multiple

3954
02:54:35,239 --> 02:54:40,190
candidates that have our sponsors of

3955
02:54:38,050 --> 02:54:43,310
different cannabis bills that are going

3956
02:54:40,190 --> 02:54:45,560
to be running for election so it no

3957
02:54:43,310 --> 02:54:47,119
matter what happens you know over the

3958
02:54:45,560 --> 02:54:50,181
next year and a half it's going to be a

3959
02:54:47,120 --> 02:54:51,711
active cannabis federal reform is going

3960
02:54:50,181 --> 02:54:53,810
to be a active thing whether or not it

3961
02:54:51,710 --> 02:54:57,979
happens before the election or after the

3962
02:54:53,810 --> 02:55:00,949
election you just the way that cannabis

3963
02:54:57,979 --> 02:55:02,479
laws are going to be in five years are

3964
02:55:00,950 --> 02:55:03,829
gonna be completely different than the

3965
02:55:02,479 --> 02:55:08,029
way they were five years ago

3966
02:55:03,829 --> 02:55:10,880
oh yeah so it's laws right thank you

3967
02:55:08,030 --> 02:55:12,351
with a lot of states a lot of the new

3968
02:55:10,880 --> 02:55:14,300
states that I've seen they're cut

3969
02:55:12,351 --> 02:55:16,431
cutting and pasting rate similar

3970
02:55:14,300 --> 02:55:18,409
regulations what they see is the best

3971
02:55:16,431 --> 02:55:20,329
regulations on the west coast the East

3972
02:55:18,409 --> 02:55:22,729
Coast will cut and paste a little bit

3973
02:55:20,329 --> 02:55:25,460
out of each state transpose it into

3974
02:55:22,729 --> 02:55:28,819
their codex is their legislation and

3975
02:55:25,460 --> 02:55:31,310
then end up passing similar bills so you

3976
02:55:28,819 --> 02:55:33,819
end up having a faster evolution within

3977
02:55:31,310 --> 02:55:37,369
the industry of the bills getting passed

3978
02:55:33,819 --> 02:55:40,909
but I think I don't know if we'll see

3979
02:55:37,370 --> 02:55:43,730
full federal legalization before the

3980
02:55:40,909 --> 02:55:46,970
next presidential election but I think

3981
02:55:43,729 --> 02:55:50,000
that you know 2021 is gonna be a

3982
02:55:46,970 --> 02:55:52,279
interesting year for federal law change

3983
02:55:50,000 --> 02:55:53,630
and when do you think that puts

3984
02:55:52,280 --> 02:55:55,700
everybody's opinion on when that might

3985
02:55:53,630 --> 02:55:58,189
change like their idea like you just

3986
02:55:55,700 --> 02:56:01,521
said 2021 does anybody else see it

3987
02:55:58,190 --> 02:56:03,290
further out or possibility for I think

3988
02:56:01,521 --> 02:56:06,440
that you're gonna see federal change for

3989
02:56:03,290 --> 02:56:10,370
medic allowing medical or rescheduling

3990
02:56:06,440 --> 02:56:13,131
in 2021 it's gonna take years to pass

3991
02:56:10,370 --> 02:56:14,891
it's it like any let that federal

3992
02:56:13,130 --> 02:56:17,260
legislation it's going to take you

3993
02:56:14,890 --> 02:56:18,761
it's you know two steps forward and then

3994
02:56:17,261 --> 02:56:20,620
you'll realize that one of those steps

3995
02:56:18,761 --> 02:56:26,021
forward you have to take a step back and

3996
02:56:20,620 --> 02:56:29,170
another two steps forward got it

3997
02:56:26,021 --> 02:56:32,021
if rescheduling happens which it's

3998
02:56:29,170 --> 02:56:33,790
already happened with CBD at the federal

3999
02:56:32,021 --> 02:56:36,670
level in the United States if

4000
02:56:33,790 --> 02:56:37,960
rescheduling happens then it will be a

4001
02:56:36,670 --> 02:56:39,610
drug

4002
02:56:37,959 --> 02:56:42,340
whichever compounds it is they're

4003
02:56:39,610 --> 02:56:46,601
claiming as a drug and that's really not

4004
02:56:42,341 --> 02:56:49,030
a great direction things to go in no ok

4005
02:56:46,601 --> 02:56:52,181
then they control it as a ingredient

4006
02:56:49,030 --> 02:56:54,761
exactly Marcus exactly and so I'm really

4007
02:56:52,181 --> 02:56:56,140
I'm a big fan of as many people as

4008
02:56:54,761 --> 02:56:58,479
possible being able to grow their own

4009
02:56:56,140 --> 02:57:00,129
and one of the beauties of hash purchase

4010
02:56:58,479 --> 02:57:05,591
they've grown their own they can learn

4011
02:57:00,129 --> 02:57:08,260
how to make their own medicine it's it's

4012
02:57:05,591 --> 02:57:09,310
an ongoing thing and I in terms of

4013
02:57:08,261 --> 02:57:12,460
helping the general of the whole

4014
02:57:09,310 --> 02:57:14,920
population of a poke on the planet as

4015
02:57:12,459 --> 02:57:16,300
well as the animals that share it with

4016
02:57:14,920 --> 02:57:18,250
us that also have endocannabinoid

4017
02:57:16,300 --> 02:57:22,689
systems I left with normalizing the

4018
02:57:18,250 --> 02:57:25,091
plant physically but if you look at

4019
02:57:22,690 --> 02:57:26,620
legalization quote-unquote as it has

4020
02:57:25,091 --> 02:57:29,011
happened here in California

4021
02:57:26,620 --> 02:57:31,450
what it is really is really legit

4022
02:57:29,011 --> 02:57:33,819
commercialization it's not legalization

4023
02:57:31,450 --> 02:57:36,280
it's legal if there is legalization in

4024
02:57:33,819 --> 02:57:39,190
that yeah you can have an ounce and and

4025
02:57:36,280 --> 02:57:41,471
as an adult the police can't mess with

4026
02:57:39,190 --> 02:57:43,899
of having an ounce of dried flowers so I

4027
02:57:41,470 --> 02:57:46,329
saw them how to concentrate but in terms

4028
02:57:43,899 --> 02:57:49,119
of again folks who actually need

4029
02:57:46,329 --> 02:57:51,250
cannabis I know I sound like a one-trick

4030
02:57:49,120 --> 02:57:53,920
pony here what it's a compelling need

4031
02:57:51,250 --> 02:57:57,579
that's the thing it's a compelling need

4032
02:57:53,920 --> 02:57:59,319
and when you look at legalization so to

4033
02:57:57,579 --> 02:58:01,601
speak how it might play out in the

4034
02:57:59,319 --> 02:58:02,979
United States my fear is that yes if it

4035
02:58:01,601 --> 02:58:05,021
goes in the right direction of

4036
02:58:02,979 --> 02:58:07,750
rescheduling

4037
02:58:05,021 --> 02:58:09,820
where would THC land on it and how are

4038
02:58:07,750 --> 02:58:12,970
you going to go to a drug store because

4039
02:58:09,819 --> 02:58:14,681
that's where drugs are available we're

4040
02:58:12,970 --> 02:58:19,989
going to blow out the dispensary model

4041
02:58:14,681 --> 02:58:24,730
and turn that into Walgreens and CVS and

4042
02:58:19,989 --> 02:58:26,229
these other chain stores and that level

4043
02:58:24,729 --> 02:58:29,079
of commercialization is coming to the

4044
02:58:26,229 --> 02:58:32,829
cannabis marketplace no question about

4045
02:58:29,079 --> 02:58:34,329
but I think for a number of years it's

4046
02:58:32,829 --> 02:58:35,829
going to be very complicated and

4047
02:58:34,329 --> 02:58:37,989
difficult because it states rights

4048
02:58:35,829 --> 02:58:41,229
issues and local jurisdictions and

4049
02:58:37,989 --> 02:58:43,750
national policy and we'll see

4050
02:58:41,229 --> 02:58:46,180
I mean it's come a long way in my life I

4051
02:58:43,750 --> 02:58:47,649
mean most of my adult life in the United

4052
02:58:46,181 --> 02:58:50,560
States you could go to jail for having a

4053
02:58:47,649 --> 02:58:52,779
joint and now it's look at where we are

4054
02:58:50,560 --> 02:58:57,279
now so I give thanks every day in that

4055
02:58:52,780 --> 02:58:59,051
way we've come so far but right here in

4056
02:58:57,280 --> 02:59:01,420
California which is you know we've had

4057
02:58:59,050 --> 02:59:04,170
legal quote/unquote cannabis for twenty

4058
02:59:01,420 --> 02:59:06,879
years or more

4059
02:59:04,170 --> 02:59:08,860
some of the folks he most need cannabis

4060
02:59:06,879 --> 02:59:11,199
so their supply chain has been disrupted

4061
02:59:08,860 --> 02:59:15,880
because of law the legalization

4062
02:59:11,200 --> 02:59:19,181
structure just outlawed compassionate

4063
02:59:15,879 --> 02:59:20,739
use cooperatives collective model and so

4064
02:59:19,181 --> 02:59:29,319
that's one of the ways that legalization

4065
02:59:20,739 --> 02:59:34,619
can play out it's it's not great that's

4066
02:59:29,319 --> 02:59:37,390
enough hi mark thanks for sharing wait

4090
