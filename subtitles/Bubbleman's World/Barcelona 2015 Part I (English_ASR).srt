00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:29,050
hey guys welcome to bubble man's world

3
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,640
and I guess welcome to Barcelona

4
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:33,789
yesterday was an incredible day I

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,620
arrived early and man it was just

6
00:00:33,789 --> 00:00:37,269
non-stop so much so that I never even

7
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:39,280
pulled my camera out I think I took a

8
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:41,800
few pictures and upgraded Facebook and

9
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,530
Instagram a few times but for the most

10
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:46,689
part I I went down to HQ and bumped into

11
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:49,239
dahveed and head du which was obviously

12
00:00:46,689 --> 00:00:50,799
just the pleasure of pleasures so great

13
00:00:49,238 --> 00:00:53,079
to see those guys they take the utmost

14
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:55,599
care of me gave me some beautiful dry

15
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:58,838
subhash and many other flavors that i

16
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:01,539
haven't right here bumped into mac the

17
00:00:58,838 --> 00:01:04,329
great gardener and got my good old

18
00:01:01,539 --> 00:01:06,929
friend barb yeah so I think that's what

19
00:01:04,329 --> 00:01:10,719
we're gonna be opening the day with here

20
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:14,860
I've not gonna mess around too much

21
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:16,450
because once again I brought a converter

22
00:01:14,859 --> 00:01:18,189
I didn't bring a step-down so really I

23
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:20,079
probably only have about five minutes to

24
00:01:18,189 --> 00:01:22,599
run power through this unit through this

25
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:25,509
web to get things heated and working

26
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:27,280
before it will no longer work until I

27
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:30,070
meet up with the Dominator guys today

28
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,650
he's brought me a specific width that is

29
00:01:30,069 --> 00:01:34,929
4 to 20 power so it won't blow and he's

30
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:37,270
brought me a plug for the European plug

31
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:38,620
so I won't need a converter I'm just

32
00:01:37,269 --> 00:01:41,469

33
