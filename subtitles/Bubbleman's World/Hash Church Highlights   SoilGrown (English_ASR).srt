1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:07,589
yeah I guess you could say that first

2
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:11,638
but in the parchment man I mean it all

3
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:14,570
comes down to uh oh my gosh mean you

4
00:00:11,638 --> 00:00:17,368
know I like melts I like to dab so uh

5
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:18,929
getting low on my melts I really started

6
00:00:17,368 --> 00:00:21,329
playing around with it when it came to

7
00:00:18,929 --> 00:00:23,879
my no milks wrath started running

8
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:26,399
getting low on my melts so I started

9
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:28,500
messing with my no melts and I remember

10
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:31,890
looking back to one time when I pressed

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,390
I over pressed the bubble with the hair

12
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:36,570
curler rather than a straightener you

13
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:39,030
know I was using my wife's curler well I

14
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:41,670
over Preston I I noticed that the oils

15
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:43,739
were separated from the UH from the rest

16
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:45,239
of the hash you know you know I didn't

17
00:00:43,738 --> 00:00:47,699
think anything of it back then I just

18
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:49,828
kind of put it back together fold it and

19
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,179
I'll have some pressed hash dabbed it to

20
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:55,859
what it could you know some three star

21
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:57,509
dabbing like three star so as I got low

22
00:00:55,859 --> 00:01:02,000
on my melts that's when I really thought

23
00:00:57,509 --> 00:01:05,128
about it you know I came to mind so

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,390
broke out the the flattener and then

25
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:09,030
that's when I started flattening the

26
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:12,030
hash and I noticed the rosin coming out

27
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:14,219
and that's where I would collect it and

28
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,989
what what what brought you to the hair

29
00:01:14,219 --> 00:01:17,548
curler like what made you use that did

30
00:01:15,989 --> 00:01:20,579
you were use did you see someone using

31
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:24,210
that or did you just actually the idea

32
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:26,368
came from nicotine he I seen him using a

33
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:28,530
hair straightener just to press in the

34
00:01:26,368 --> 00:01:30,420
hash you know I was rubbing it over the

35
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:33,450
top of my nail so I can press it out and

36
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:36,060
then using a lighter seemed like a much

37
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:37,469
better idea but I didn't have a hair

38
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,530
iron at the time so I just took my

39
00:01:37,469 --> 00:01:44,849
ladies straight or curler and it works

40
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:47,159
really well very cool I like following

41
00:01:44,849 --> 00:01:51,419
it back and being the influences you

42
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:52,950
know but the whole flower you know

43
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:56,478
pressing the flowers and getting the

44
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:59,129
oils from that that just came out say

45
00:01:56,478 --> 00:02:02,218
you know luck has a lot to do with it

46
00:01:59,129 --> 00:02:03,839
the simple fact of running out of no

47
00:02:02,218 --> 00:02:08,728
melts now yeah

48
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:10,170
now it's time to start washing just

49
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:11,819
playing around I guess you know we're

50
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:13,649
sim sitting here with my father-in-law I

51
00:02:11,818 --> 00:02:15,810
took a bun and he

52
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,310
like what are you doing so I put it

53
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:19,318
between the straightener and I squeezed

54
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:21,180
it as hard as I could I didn't think

55
00:02:19,318 --> 00:02:23,389
anything was gonna happen to my surprise

56
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:26,219
I seen the oils around the flat bud

57
00:02:23,389 --> 00:02:30,539
scraped them up did it a couple times

58
00:02:26,219 --> 00:02:34,370
and then we dabbed it no no residue I

59
00:02:30,539 --> 00:02:37,699
mean I was I wasn't me I was shocked

60
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:37,700
that's sweet
