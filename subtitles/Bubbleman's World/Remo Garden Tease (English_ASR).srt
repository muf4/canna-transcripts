25
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:25,839
turn that green okay so here we go

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,840
guys RockStar at the door

27
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:40,360

28
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,840

00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:43,319
that he has of course it's not the Girl

30
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,880
Scout cookies that any of us really

31
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:48,478
recognize but I'll tell you they have

32
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:49,920
stacked in the danky nugs now you've got

33
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:52,280
that little one in the background that's

34
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,920
probably still going to be a pound plant

35
00:01:52,280 --> 00:02:00,118
look at this DNA Kosher

36
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:03,240
Kush okay let me give you an idea on how

37
00:02:00,118 --> 00:02:05,438
big this PL is here I am 6 ft tall

38
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:07,359
standing next to it with my arm

39
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:10,318
stretched out as high as I can I cannot

40
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:13,520
reach the top of this strain Kosher Kush

41
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:15,919
DNA genetics representing strong as

42
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,519
always in Ramos's Garden if you walk

43
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:22,079
through uh here we have a really nice

44
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:23,439
rockar this thing is high as [ __ ] I

45
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,000
think that's a rockar it could actually

46
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:31,598
be a UBC Kemo Kush let me just check no

47
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,598
that's Rockstar for sure very nice

48
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,680
uh that's

49
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:40,559
Rockstar this

50
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:43,319
is UBC chemo kush or was that over here

51
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:46,598

52
00:02:43,318 --> 00:02:49,199
chemo now this is just a pleasure to

53
00:02:46,598 --> 00:02:50,799
video anytime I have to admit I can get

54
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:51,919
into the room and get a little video of

55
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,760
this

56
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:56,559
plant so impressive the resin production

57
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:58,959
the colors another one of those Girl

58
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,840
Scout cookies whatever it is I don't

59
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,080
know the the cut but it is very frosty

60
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,080
very covered in

61
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,840
resin another one of those uh in the

62
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,319
background there you can see the

63
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:14,519
kosher almost hitting the roof of this I

64
00:03:11,318 --> 00:03:14,518
don't know 10t

65
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:19,560
ceiling so sweet always a pleasure to be

66
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:22,399
able to go and walk through Remo the

67
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:24,719
urban Grower's room these were all grown

68
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,360
with his newest nutrient line I think

69
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:30,080
that he's showing people that

70
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,720
uh well his nutrients definitely work I

71
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,400
haven't tried them myself but being a

72
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:35,400
good friend of his I will definitely

73
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,120
give them a shot when I look at the

74
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,319
resin production of his

75
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:44,080
plants that's going to be that UBC chemo

76
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:46,479
again yep UBC chemo this is a strain

77
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,080
that Remo uh gifted me a while back I

78
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:51,919
have it in my garden really strong

79
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:54,959
hard-hitting cush that musky cushy

80
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:59,119
flavor uh unmistakable definitely some

81
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:01,640
strong OG cut I'm sure it's a keeper and

82
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:06,039
uh every time he grows it as you can

83
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:06,039
see it just looks

84
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:16,238
amazing going have to get this big wide

85
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:19,639

off there we go get a little closer like

87
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:22,799

88
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:31,319
