cannabis it's the next goal people and

79
00:05:31,168 --> 00:05:37,978
that's why we're all here today we don't

80
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:42,689
have to find it from the ground we have

81
00:05:37,978 --> 00:05:44,930
more wood from the earth we don't see

82
00:05:42,689 --> 00:05:44,930
the difference

83
00:05:48,329 --> 00:05:55,449
rounded neck but basically to know

84
00:05:53,139 --> 00:05:57,669
history isn't worth so much but what is

85
00:05:55,449 --> 00:06:03,189
its real value it's something just a

86
00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:05,680
look at right pajamas it has more value

87
00:06:03,189 --> 00:06:10,899
than any of the minimum or plant on this

88
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:15,310
earth it's a people it's a fiber it's a

89
00:06:10,899 --> 00:06:17,049
food hey it's a medicine and that

90
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:19,449
medicine we're just scratching the

91
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:21,449
surface really we have no idea how

92
00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:24,399
things are gonna happen to the patient

93
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:26,649
the future is cannabis the teacher is

94
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:28,509
now and it is until the atomic

95
00:06:26,649 --> 00:06:31,019

watch the industry grow from time your

115
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:50,259
Vancouver when I virtually do everybody

116
00:07:47,288 --> 00:07:52,719
involved in the dispensary industry to

117
00:07:50,259 --> 00:07:54,490
the current scenario where as a

118
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:58,659
tremendous number of players entering

119
00:07:54,490 --> 00:08:01,240
the LP market as well as it seems like

120
00:07:58,658 --> 00:08:02,918
more and more great market medical

121
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:07,389
cannabis dispensaries opening at least

122
00:08:02,918 --> 00:08:09,129
in Vancouver every week it's not often

123
00:08:07,389 --> 00:08:10,900
you get the opportunity to speak to such

124
00:08:09,129 --> 00:08:12,788
a varied group of people and I

125
00:08:10,899 --> 00:08:15,429
appreciate that opportunity I just have

126
00:08:12,788 --> 00:08:17,680
seen here from virtually on the aspect

127
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:20,740
of about the cannabis for patients all

128
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:25,110
the way right up to investors and

129
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:27,610
companies seeking to enter this sector

130
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:30,968
I'm gonna assume for the purpose of my

131
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:32,800
remarks today that because this is a

132
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:34,740
business oriented conference most of the

133
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:38,848
people here are already familiar with

134
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:41,940
the general contours of EMM

135
00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:43,229
purposes regulations if you are looking

136
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:46,980
to get into the sector you're not

137
00:08:43,229 --> 00:08:49,350
familiar with the essential basics of

138
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:50,789
the system I do offer full-day seminars

139
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:52,290
where I come to your place of business I

140
00:08:50,789 --> 00:08:54,899
walk you in your management's go through

141
00:08:52,289 --> 00:08:57,809
the MMPR impart to you as much knowledge

142
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:59,339
as I can over the course of that days

143
00:08:57,809 --> 00:09:01,588
the least you have a baseline

144
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:05,279
understanding of what the regulatory

145
00:09:01,589 --> 00:09:06,779
scheme looks like what the rules are so

146
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:09,659
that you can get and understand whether

147
00:09:06,778 --> 00:09:11,159
this is an opportunity that you wish to

148
00:09:09,659 --> 00:09:12,990
pursue and one of the hurdles and

149
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:15,689
challenges in pursuing those

150
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:17,759
opportunities I'm also not going to

151
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:21,000
discuss the ongoing litigation

152
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:23,818
underneath mmm AR or the repeal that

153
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,708
MMAR the former regulatory scheme

154
00:09:23,818 --> 00:09:26,818
Johnny Conroy has seized in the back of

155
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:28,409
the room I know he's gonna have some

156
00:09:26,818 --> 00:09:31,198
things to say about that later that

157
00:09:28,409 --> 00:09:34,588
could possibly do it as well as he will

158
00:09:31,198 --> 00:09:36,318
so I'm gonna leave that on inside yeah

159
00:09:34,589 --> 00:09:38,519
question is about the ongoing litigation

160
00:09:36,318 --> 00:09:39,750
I'm happy answers I'm gonna think

161
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:42,778
there's gonna be an interesting panel

162
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:44,519
they just afternoon as well what I am

163
00:09:42,778 --> 00:09:48,078
going to focus on with my remarks this

164
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:52,289
afternoon are three areas of the MMPR

165
00:09:48,078 --> 00:09:54,088
that I believe already cry out for a new

166
00:09:52,289 --> 00:09:56,578
regulatory approach or amended

167
00:09:54,089 --> 00:09:59,670
regulatory approach the lens that I'd

168
00:09:56,578 --> 00:10:02,549
like to view these issues through is

169
00:09:59,669 --> 00:10:03,659
that a patient access this program is

170
00:10:02,549 --> 00:10:06,899
Terry mentioned is the home

171
00:10:03,659 --> 00:10:10,139
no the MMAR program in the MMPR program

172
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:12,090
really amazed are designed to ensure and

173
00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:14,759
we've heard about important decisions

174
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:16,920
requiring the patient strictly

175
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:18,720
chronically ill Canadians that require

176
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:21,629
or wish to use for a lot of medical

177
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,490
purposes having reasonable access to net

178
00:10:21,629 --> 00:10:25,439
and that's a right that's grounded in

179
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:27,750
Section seven of the Charter of Rights

180
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,120
and Freedoms and one that's not going to

181
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:32,789
be going away I think it's important to

182
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:34,259
while we cover all the different aspects

183
00:10:32,789 --> 00:10:37,110
of the industry not lose sight of the

184
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:38,819
fact that this exists is because sick

185
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:40,860
and suffering citizens of this country

186
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:43,200
and residents of this country need

187
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:47,279
access to this medicine it's good for

188
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:49,800
them and it's it can both help their

189
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:52,500
symptoms as well as we're now learning

190
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:58,259
how potentially curative effects whole

191
00:10:52,500 --> 00:11:00,690
host of conditions so patient focus in

192
00:10:58,259 --> 00:11:02,189
my view absolutely critical not just for

193
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:04,380
understanding the regulatory approach

194
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:07,290
that should be applied but also for the

195
00:11:04,379 --> 00:11:09,240
success of your business as in any

196
00:11:07,289 --> 00:11:11,639
business see if you're not serving your

197
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,139
customer base and in this case those are

198
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:14,549
the patients that require access to

199
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:15,990
medical cannabis or wishing to use

200
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:17,939
medical cannabis or Kevin the space

201
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:21,450
products then you're not going to be

202
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:24,600
successful and so my focus here is to

203
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:27,030
focus to talk about really I think three

204
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:29,519
areas in which the regulatory scheme can

205
00:11:27,029 --> 00:11:32,939
be amended either through lobbying or

206
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:36,779
litigation and those changes will both

207
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:38,940
run patient access as wetlands benefit

208
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:41,339
people in the industry that after all

209
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,810
want to have a successful company that

210
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:44,450
ends

211
00:11:41,809 --> 00:11:46,549
again making money and paying your

212
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:50,270
employees payin bills and those kinds of

213
00:11:46,549 --> 00:11:52,939
things so I have three general areas I'd

214
00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:54,379
like to talk about the first is and I

215
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:56,029
think joy Davies probably talked a bit

216
00:11:54,379 --> 00:11:58,299
about this this morning although I

217
00:11:56,028 --> 00:12:01,278
unfortunately missed her presentation

218
00:11:58,299 --> 00:12:03,500
lobbying the provinces for covering the

219
00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:07,639
costs of canvas canvas based medicines

220
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:10,759
the sad reality as we heard in the

221
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:12,949
earlier speech before the break is that

222
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:15,259
most patients that are currently using

223
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:17,870
canvas around the purposes at least many

224
00:12:15,259 --> 00:12:21,200
are the same on fixed incomes are

225
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:23,600
seniors they're living in situations in

226
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:26,390
which they're simply unable under either

227
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,639
the old system or the current system to

228
00:12:26,389 --> 00:12:32,179
afford sufficient quantities of cannabis

229
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:34,399
medicine it is the provinces and not

230
00:12:32,179 --> 00:12:38,088
Health Canada that determines which

231
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:40,220
medicines to cover in terms of

232
00:12:38,089 --> 00:12:41,870
reimbursement cost of the medicines and

233
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:46,279
so I think that there needs to be a

234
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:47,750
focus put by patients and by licensed

235
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:49,730
producers in this industry you're not

236
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:51,830
going to the provinces and making the

237
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:53,810
case that canvas the canvas based

238
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:56,870
medicine should be covered under

239
00:12:53,809 --> 00:12:59,989
provincial plans like we have with MSP

240
00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:03,310
here British Columbia I'll admit today

241
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:06,089
and I am not my usual self typically I

242
00:13:03,309 --> 00:13:08,818
am pretty stone-cold

243
00:13:06,089 --> 00:13:12,540
stoic but we're coming up on four years

244
00:13:08,818 --> 00:13:16,110
the Saturday money husband marked in US

245
00:13:12,539 --> 00:13:18,958
federal prison for helping begin twenty

246
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:20,909
years ago the industry and the movement

247
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:24,299
that we're all sitting here today

248
00:13:20,909 --> 00:13:26,639
talking about as if it's legal and it

249
00:13:24,299 --> 00:13:30,929
works it on illegal are totally legal

250
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:35,188
for medical but um I gotta admit I am

251
00:13:30,929 --> 00:13:43,258
getting tired of waiting for my husband

252
00:13:35,188 --> 00:13:45,778
to come I am a business owner I employ

253
00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:48,089
twenty eight people I have four

254
00:13:45,778 --> 00:13:49,708
businesses cannabis culture calm was one

255
00:13:48,089 --> 00:13:51,329
of the first print two magazines and

256
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:53,088
websites in the world about marijuana

257
00:13:51,328 --> 00:13:56,549
and right now it remains one of the top

258
00:13:53,089 --> 00:13:59,550
marijuana news websites in the world pop

259
00:13:56,549 --> 00:14:01,378
TV is a video website it began when

260
00:13:59,549 --> 00:14:04,078
there was no video on the internet at

261
00:14:01,379 --> 00:14:06,808
all in 2000 when my husband Mark and we

262
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:09,448
started it at the same time as CBC

263
00:14:06,808 --> 00:14:11,818
television launching their revolutionary

264
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:14,159
new video streaming on the Internet

265
00:14:11,818 --> 00:14:16,799
my husband started a lot of things

266
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:19,409
starting 20 years ago with bringing High

267
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:22,708
Times magazines and books and bongs and

268
00:14:19,409 --> 00:14:25,259
types into Canada to sell and begin this

269
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:29,328
industry when even a magazine about pot

270
00:14:25,259 --> 00:14:32,759
was prohibited and had a heavy fine so

271
00:14:29,328 --> 00:14:34,919
mark and twenty years ago this industry

272
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:37,740
and he created cannabis culture magazine

273
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:39,339
he created pot TV he started every scene

274
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:41,710
which was the biggest

275
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:44,350
in the world selling millions of seeds

276
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:46,090
and giving all the proceeds back to

277
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:48,580
finance and activism through the

278
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:50,590
magazine to plot TV through ballot

279
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:52,990
initiatives which made medical marijuana

280
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:54,580
legal in a number of US states through

281
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:56,440
financing groups like Marijuana Policy

282
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:58,629
Project which is now a multi-million

283
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:00,790
dollar major lobbying group in the

284
00:14:58,629 --> 00:15:01,240
United States changing laws in numerous

285
00:15:00,789 --> 00:15:03,789
states

286
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:06,009
Merck helped finance all sorts of groups

287
00:15:03,789 --> 00:15:07,449
and rallies and programs and even the

288
00:15:06,009 --> 00:15:09,399
United States Derk Enforcement

289
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:11,800
Administration tracked the millions of

290
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:13,689
dollars he made and said yes he gave it

291
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:17,169
away to political activists political

292
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:19,360
groups and no drug dealers no drug

293
00:15:17,169 --> 00:15:20,769
connections at all but they still call

294
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,899
them the most wanted drug trafficking

295
00:15:20,769 --> 00:15:25,000
kingpin in Canada and hadn't faced in 30

296
00:15:22,899 --> 00:15:27,129
years to life in prison for sending C's

297
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,259
through the mail from Canada paying

298
00:15:27,129 --> 00:15:32,049
taxes and never leaving this country

299
00:15:29,259 --> 00:15:34,360
while doing so in running for office

300
00:15:32,049 --> 00:15:36,309
creating the PC marijuana party the

301
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:38,110
marijuana party of Canada and of course

302
00:15:36,309 --> 00:15:39,939
supporting different political parties

303
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:41,430
across this country when they choose to

304
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:45,139
support people's rights

305
00:15:41,429 --> 00:15:46,789
my husband was x-rays in 2010

306
00:15:45,139 --> 00:15:49,369
and I was made to take over our business

307
00:15:46,789 --> 00:15:51,649
which is not related to marijuana itself

308
00:15:49,369 --> 00:15:54,170
in any way I've not even stepped foot

309
00:15:51,649 --> 00:15:56,208
inside and operating dispensary I don't

310
00:15:54,169 --> 00:15:58,368
have a medical license I don't have any

311
00:15:56,208 --> 00:16:00,828
connection whatsoever to medical

312
00:15:58,369 --> 00:16:03,619
marijuana except to say people have a

313
00:16:00,828 --> 00:16:06,289
right to use it either to treat what

314
00:16:03,619 --> 00:16:08,869
ails them or to prevent illness from

315
00:16:06,289 --> 00:16:23,719
setting in and that isn't right we all

316
00:16:08,869 --> 00:16:25,189
have and I've always right okay well

317
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:27,259
thank you all for joining us today

318
00:16:25,188 --> 00:16:29,178
good afternoon my name is Mark

319
00:16:27,259 --> 00:16:31,058
Richardson I'm a local businessman owner

distributor for hemp hoodlum clothing

322
00:16:33,318 --> 00:16:38,328
here in Canada I've been involved with

323
00:16:36,048 --> 00:16:42,649
cannabis fairly intimately for the last

324
00:16:38,328 --> 00:16:44,659
25 years actually not 15 that's okay and

325
00:16:42,649 --> 00:16:46,519
it's I'm not a scientist I'm not a

326
00:16:44,659 --> 00:16:47,389
doctor all of this has been through

327
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:49,249
bioassay

328
00:16:47,389 --> 00:16:51,019
a lot of my experiences have been

329
00:16:49,249 --> 00:16:54,259
learned through my experience with

330
00:16:51,019 --> 00:16:56,509
cannabis it's it's nice to see everyone

331
00:16:54,259 --> 00:16:58,879
showing an interest in cannabis here in

332
00:16:56,509 --> 00:17:00,499
in Canada I'm gonna be covering an

333
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:02,869
overview of cannabis by talking a little

334
00:17:00,499 --> 00:17:05,750
bit about industrial cannabis which is

335
00:17:02,869 --> 00:17:08,120
hemp recreational cannabis use and

336
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:11,599
medical cannabis use and I prefer to use

337
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:14,208
the word cannabis over marijuana mainly

338
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:16,278
because the the foundation of marijuana

339
00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:19,068
it's a Spanish word it's rooted in

340
00:17:16,278 --> 00:17:22,308
racism it comes from the 30s so we all

341
00:17:19,068 --> 00:17:23,720
be referring to cannabis today all of

342
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:26,209
them whether it's to be smoked

343
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:27,558
recreational to be used medicinally or

344
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:30,308
to be used industrially I'll be

345
00:17:27,558 --> 00:17:32,778
referring to it as cannabis I started I

346
00:17:30,308 --> 00:17:34,490
started my own company fresh heddes

347
00:17:32,778 --> 00:17:37,308
which is a company I've run for the past

348
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:40,210
15 years and we specialize in glandular

349
00:17:37,308 --> 00:17:43,879
trichomes isolation

350
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:45,230
little try to get to a picture to give

351
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,090
you a little bit of an idea there's a

352
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:50,210
glandular trichomes right there I took

353
00:17:47,089 --> 00:17:52,668
this photo myself you have two types of

354
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:55,308
trichomes here a capitate stalked

355
00:17:52,669 --> 00:17:56,610
glandular trichomes is the tall one and

356
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:59,490
then the smaller one is

357
00:17:56,609 --> 00:18:01,259
capitate sessile there are three types

358
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:03,329
of trichomes there's a third one called

359
00:18:01,259 --> 00:18:09,710
bulbous which looks exactly like these

360
00:18:03,329 --> 00:18:13,730
ones but it doesn't have it doesn't have

361
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:16,230
a stalk it's just the head here's a

362
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:17,640
picture of a cannabis plant that you can

363
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:19,829
see is just covered in these medicinal

364
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,570
aspects and Kirk touched on it a little

365
00:18:19,829 --> 00:18:24,869
bit as well as I'm sure dr. Hornby did

366
00:18:21,569 --> 00:18:28,740
all of the medicinal value that we seek

367
00:18:24,869 --> 00:18:31,678
the cannabinoids THC the terpenes the

368
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:33,960
terpenoids the modulators they all are

369
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:36,840
produced inside the glandular head of

370
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:39,900
the trichome so the actual medicine that

371
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:42,659
we're talking about here today is inside

372
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:44,730
those tiny little little glands the

373
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:47,070
resin produces the cannabinoids that we

374
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:48,808
have found to feed our endocannabinoid

375
00:18:47,069 --> 00:18:50,428
system and I wanted to tell you guys

376
00:18:48,808 --> 00:18:52,109
just a little bit about the

377
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:54,000
endocannabinoid system I'm personally

378
00:18:52,109 --> 00:18:55,829
not a doctor but I've been learning a

379
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,690
lot from the doctors that I know and and

380
00:18:55,829 --> 00:18:59,819
studying and so the system the

381
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:01,320
endocannabinoid system or the ECS is a

382
00:18:59,819 --> 00:19:03,359
system that each and every one of you

383
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:05,428
here today has a system that helps

384
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:07,979
regulate the biological functions in

385
00:19:05,429 --> 00:19:10,230
your body now in the 90s we discovered

386
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:12,660
receptors in our brains called cb1 and

387
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:14,700
later discovered a second receptor

388
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:15,660
called cb2 which are found primarily in

389
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:18,150
the immune system

390
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:20,340
the GI tract liver spleen bones heart

391
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:22,620
and kidney and peripheral nervous system

392
00:19:20,339 --> 00:19:24,449
these discoveries of the cannabinoid

393
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:26,219
receptors endocannabinoids and the

394
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:28,860
related enzymes that make up what is now

395
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:30,390
called the endocannabinoid system and it

396
00:19:28,859 --> 00:19:32,729
seems to be essential in most of our

397
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:35,340
physiological systems and it is

398
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:37,529
essential to life as it relates messages

399
00:19:35,339 --> 00:19:40,019
that affects how we eat sleep relax

400
00:19:37,529 --> 00:19:41,460
forget and protect these receptors

401
00:19:40,019 --> 00:19:44,069
protect proteins include

402
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:46,230
endocannabinoids synthetic cannabinoids

403
00:19:44,069 --> 00:19:48,960
and of course phyto cannabinoids which

404
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:50,640
are the ones found in cannabis and this

405
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,650
leads me into my final discussion I'm

406
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,290
getting beeped here I'm sixteen seconds

407
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:57,059
over I hear a lot of people say well I

408
00:19:55,289 --> 00:19:58,920
support medical cannabis but not

409
00:19:57,058 --> 00:19:59,819
recreational well let's took a look at

410
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:02,070
that through the eyes of the

411
00:19:59,819 --> 00:20:04,200
endocannabinoid system now obviously

412
00:20:02,069 --> 00:20:06,329
smoking a lot of anything isn't going to

413
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,340
be ideal but vaporization and oral

414
00:20:06,329 --> 00:20:10,019
ingestion will feed your endocannabinoid

415
00:20:08,339 --> 00:20:12,269
system and offer preventative me

416
00:20:10,019 --> 00:20:14,490
avoiding health problems later in life I

417
00:20:12,269 --> 00:20:16,049
spoke recently with dr. David Allen who

418
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:17,880
specializes in the endocannabinoid

419
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:19,500
system and he mentioned that if people

420
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:21,570
could rid themselves of the ECS

421
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:24,029
deficiencies this could help avoid such

422
00:20:21,569 --> 00:20:26,460
things as old age diabetes stroke and

423
00:20:24,029 --> 00:20:28,799
heart disease and his real focus is on

424
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:30,720
the ability for the body to continue to

425
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:33,149
produce insulin through endocannabinoid

426
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:35,460
regulation deficiencies in this older

427
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:37,530
age could cause old-age diabetes which

428
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:39,150
can in turn cause diabetic complications

429
00:20:37,529 --> 00:20:41,309
and we know that cannabis has never

430
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:43,320
caused any harm never killed a person

431
00:20:41,309 --> 00:20:45,869
and in fact this made amazing medicine

432
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:49,169
is one of the only plants one of the

433
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:51,750
only things people consume on this earth

434
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:54,810
just for the euphoric side-effects and

435
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:56,490
they have been for centuries now it may

436
00:20:54,809 --> 00:20:58,349
sound ridiculous but for me this is how

437
00:20:56,490 --> 00:21:00,150
I started on my road to learning and

438
00:20:58,349 --> 00:21:02,849
that I stand in front of you sharing

439
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:04,440
through my relationship with cannabis as

440
00:21:02,849 --> 00:21:06,179
a young person who was experimenting

441
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,620
with experimental cannabis I was able to

442
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:09,269
learn and teach myself about this

443
00:21:07,619 --> 00:21:11,309
miraculous plant as I developed a

444
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:14,039
relationship with it today I'm a federal

445
00:21:11,309 --> 00:21:16,139
exempt cannabis user and grower and can

446
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:17,879
say that growing is an aspect of the

447
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:20,100
plant is part of the healing that it

448
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:21,930
offers me the gardening aspect of being

449
00:21:20,099 --> 00:21:24,629
able to produce my own medicine within

450
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:27,390
my own space and breed my own strain is

451
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:29,760
one I do not take for granted I stand

452
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:32,430
before you as supported supporter of

453
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:35,069
licensed producers personal production

454
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:37,680
licenses dispensaries and all forms of

455
00:21:35,069 --> 00:21:39,029
cannabis trade and sale everyone should

456
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:42,930
be allowed to grow this wonderful

457
00:21:39,029 --> 00:21:47,089
medicine thanks for your time man pretty

458
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:47,090
good job another very bright

459
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:51,730
of American farmers and producers and

460
00:21:49,779 --> 00:21:53,440
consumers in the United States to be

461
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:56,230
able to access industrial hemp food

462
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:58,900
products and body care products fashion

463
00:21:56,230 --> 00:22:00,940
and composit products so a little bit

464
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:03,040
about a corporate office myself as I

465
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:04,630
said president of the Association Larry

466
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:06,279
started with him trainer

467
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:07,510
also here at the booth witness if you'd

468
00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:10,029
like to visit with him as our Vice

469
00:22:07,509 --> 00:22:12,400
President Steve Levine is our CFO a

470
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:14,319
treasurer and our edge president and

471
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:17,890
then our executive director Eric - Steve

472
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:19,450
shock so here's just a list of our quick

473
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:21,400
reward as mark was talking about the

474
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:24,970
street and this district gives you an

475
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:26,920
idea everything from a fashion to so to

476
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:28,720
Hampton Court occasion - fiber

477
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:32,460
processing and food processing is

478
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:34,960
combines our board so here's some of us

479
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:37,029
one of the things that we do is a lot is

480
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,529
working directly with the vote amp and I

481
00:22:37,029 --> 00:22:39,970
will be sharing more about the work of

482
00:22:38,529 --> 00:22:41,619
both campus I'm here in just a moment

483
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:44,259
but here we are with some of our members

484
00:22:41,619 --> 00:22:46,209
as we were up on Washington DC for our

485
00:22:44,259 --> 00:22:48,549
Lobby day this was a full organized

486
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:50,170
Lobby day when we were in the and the

487
00:22:48,549 --> 00:22:51,519
offices of our congressional leaders and

488
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:53,980
I will be displayed a little bit more

489
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:56,819
about why we are on Capitol Hill and why

490
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:59,740
our Lobby days are so important to us so

491
00:22:56,819 --> 00:23:01,839
a little bit about vote him as the the

492
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:04,299
hip industry association and how they're

493
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:05,769
registered is quite different than how

494
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:07,720
podium is registered and they're

495
00:23:05,769 --> 00:23:09,759
registered is an advocacy group which

496
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:12,309
can actually go then on to Capitol Hill

497
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:14,819
and do the appropriate lobbying that we

498
00:23:12,309 --> 00:23:17,829
need to do in the United States don't

499
00:23:14,819 --> 00:23:19,418
most of people my age I say you know

500
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:25,418
about 420

501
00:23:19,419 --> 00:23:28,028
no idea I got to appear now a number of

502
00:23:25,419 --> 00:23:30,599
the years of Hempfest in Seattle where

503
00:23:28,028 --> 00:23:35,709
this huge number of people come together

504
00:23:30,598 --> 00:23:38,108
in August and have stages and people

505
00:23:35,709 --> 00:23:40,959
talking in bands and someone one time I

506
00:23:38,108 --> 00:23:45,489
got to be on a stage just before 4:20

507
00:23:40,959 --> 00:23:47,499
and this huge puff of smoke went up and

508
00:23:45,489 --> 00:23:50,410
the police who were here and there

509
00:23:47,499 --> 00:23:51,879
although like this

510
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:53,558
[Music]

511
00:23:51,878 --> 00:23:59,618
and that's been that way for some time

512
00:23:53,558 --> 00:24:04,928
in SIA so the I've been involved in this

513
00:23:59,618 --> 00:24:09,218
issue going back to the mid seventies

514
00:24:04,929 --> 00:24:10,929
and while I grew up in Africa my father

515
00:24:09,219 --> 00:24:14,828
was a consultant on the growing of

516
00:24:10,929 --> 00:24:18,788
tobacco and the African people that some

517
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:21,418
of the commonly used cannabis and I'm

518
00:24:18,788 --> 00:24:25,419
talking the long term to cover

519
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:27,339
oh my father would pull out the plantain

520
00:24:25,419 --> 00:24:29,079
throw it on the ground that was the

521
00:24:27,338 --> 00:24:32,588
extent of the enforcement of the

522
00:24:29,078 --> 00:24:35,769
cannabis laws vacuum I'm talking the 50s

523
00:24:32,588 --> 00:24:38,128
and very early sixties and the sky

524
00:24:35,769 --> 00:24:38,128
didn't fall

525
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:49,170
as far as I am and anyway I came back to

526
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:53,100
Canada and was Calabar in 1972 I was a

527
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:55,230
just so before that so I wasn't that

528
00:24:53,099 --> 00:24:58,409
involved in everything in the 60s it was

529
00:24:55,230 --> 00:25:03,180
the early 70s that Veronica came to the

530
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:09,058
goal and I'm comparing those days

531
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:11,460
because of what I see here today it's

532
00:25:09,058 --> 00:25:13,230

yesterday guys you know what a lot of a

551
00:26:10,349 --> 00:26:13,469
lot of different crowd but the

552
00:26:11,609 --> 00:26:16,049
conference is about bringing a lot of

553
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:18,660
people in to more or less educate one

554
00:26:16,049 --> 00:26:21,149
another on the benefits of cannabis

555
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:23,730
around the health issues the prohibition

556
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:26,430
ends of it the hemp industry end of it's

557
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:30,690

finishing off with the 420 investors and

559
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:36,420
then we got into there's such a wide

560
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:39,630
review of cannabis and it was all over

561
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:42,240
it was definitely covered by CTV News

562
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:45,360
global national all the new all the

563
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:48,599
newspapers it was a great event it was a

564
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:50,369
lot of fun I liked that it was the first

565
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:52,829
event I've been to potentially ever

566
00:26:50,369 --> 00:26:54,569
where when I spoke I didn't feel as

567
00:26:52,829 --> 00:26:57,329
though I was preaching to any choir I

568
00:26:54,569 --> 00:26:58,859
could tell I was literally educating

569
00:26:57,329 --> 00:27:01,649
people in the audience that just had

570
00:26:58,859 --> 00:27:03,509
almost no knowledge whatsoever about

571
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:05,370
what I was talking about a lot of the

572
00:27:03,509 --> 00:27:08,420
people there because it was a financial

573
00:27:05,369 --> 00:27:11,519
conference are from the financial

574
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:15,870
district and that's they came in from

575
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:19,079
this area and you know they're basically

576
00:27:15,869 --> 00:27:20,289
they're they're about making money they

577
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:22,059
know that you can make money

578
00:27:20,289 --> 00:27:23,950
cannabis and the laws of changing so

579
00:27:22,059 --> 00:27:27,759
they came to check it out and it was

580
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:31,509
guys like John and Kirk to sod and John

581
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:33,700
Conroy and Jodie Emery those were kind

582
00:27:31,509 --> 00:27:36,849
of the core speakers that spoke in

583
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:39,730
regards to more of the roots and then

584
00:27:36,849 --> 00:27:42,189
you had financial people speaking and

585
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:45,220
people that do IPOs and public companies

586
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:48,730
and stock market guys and those guys

587
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:51,910
were the suits so he had the roots and

588
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:53,620
the citizens and I'll give that quote to

589
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:56,650
Kirk because yesterday he came up with

590
00:27:53,619 --> 00:27:59,139
that at lunch during the conference then

591
00:27:56,650 --> 00:28:00,670
today I'm wearing what the roots are

592
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:03,100

stuff like that but right now i am i

598

600
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:20,620

611
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:42,699
already

612
00:28:40,509 --> 00:28:44,140

617
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:53,319

618
00:28:51,509 --> 00:28:55,390
industries together and show them

619
00:28:53,319 --> 00:28:56,859
exactly the proper well you know what

620
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:58,540
like you say there's big money guys and

621
00:28:56,859 --> 00:29:00,279
that's their only interest but there's a

622
00:28:58,539 --> 00:29:01,450
lot of good guys out there that exactly

623
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:02,859
what they're looking at is not just

624
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:05,230
benefiting financially

625
00:29:02,859 --> 00:29:06,819
from the education and getting the

626
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:08,860
proper information to the patients and

627
00:29:06,819 --> 00:29:10,659
understanding this cannabis plant really

628
00:29:08,859 --> 00:29:12,069
get involved with exactly what we're

629
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:15,130
both above them pretty sure there's

630
00:29:12,069 --> 00:29:17,169
gonna be a big change yeah it's coming

631
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:21,190
for sure you can feel it and you can it

632
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:22,960
was the definitely the strangest roomful

633
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:25,558
of people I have ever in camp there were

634
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:28,870
so it was just neat to see these

635
00:29:25,558 --> 00:29:31,539
different worlds sort of leaking into

636
00:29:28,869 --> 00:29:33,609
one another and mixing in because there

637
00:29:31,539 --> 00:29:35,558
really were like literally people that

638
00:29:33,609 --> 00:29:36,490
you would just tip typical people that

639
00:29:35,558 --> 00:29:38,230
you would you know the typical

640
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:40,870
stereotype of people that you would see

641
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:43,298
like a cannabis cup you saw the same

642
00:29:40,869 --> 00:29:44,739
typical stereotype in all the suits that

643
00:29:43,298 --> 00:29:46,480
we're walking around that just looked

644
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:49,058
literally like the certain ones looked

645
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,589
like you know private investors certain

646
00:29:49,058 --> 00:29:52,298
one looked like lawyers certain they all

647
00:29:50,589 --> 00:29:55,149
just were the suits and then you have

648
00:29:52,298 --> 00:29:59,379
the roots and it was just a definitely

649
00:29:55,150 --> 00:30:02,350
interesting mix to see them all both

650
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:05,110
coming together you know once again

651
00:30:02,349 --> 00:30:08,909
brought together by cannabis which is

652
00:30:05,109 --> 00:30:08,909
great what was the headline of the story

653
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:14,819
yeah I'm not sure it was some sort of

654
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:17,080
negative connotation and there wasn't

655
00:30:14,819 --> 00:30:21,220
trying to be negatives but what it was

656
00:30:17,079 --> 00:30:22,720
is not it wasn't much people side

657
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:24,640
smoking pot there's a lot of people

658
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,960
inside will be worried and we're all on

659
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,030
the trapeze sticks I think things have

660
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:29,319
changed now they have where we're not

661
00:30:28,029 --> 00:30:33,279
everything there isn't a bunch of guys

00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:07,100
here but there was a lot of good people

698
00:32:04,819 --> 00:32:12,159
of this conference and I think that for

699
00:32:07,099 --> 00:32:14,929
my highlight of the conference was the

700
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:16,790
amount of media coverage and and and

701
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:18,590
just the fact that people were just so

702
00:32:16,789 --> 00:32:21,529
interested in and really taking a good

703
00:32:18,589 --> 00:32:22,909
look at what's going on hopefully you

704
00:32:21,529 --> 00:32:25,670
know the next one that comes to

705
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:27,890
Vancouver will be even you know busier

706
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:31,039
and more full and more people will come

707
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:33,230
to just offer what they have but also to

708
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:34,670
learn you know because it's when we all

709
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:36,589
share and learn that you can kind of

710
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:38,330
step this in to the next level of like

711
00:32:36,589 --> 00:32:39,789
how do we build the proper

712
00:32:38,329 --> 00:32:42,069
infrastructure to actually

713
00:32:39,789 --> 00:32:45,609
put this all of these ideas you all know

714
00:32:42,069 --> 00:32:49,689
that an idea is about 1% inspiration and

715
00:32:45,609 --> 00:32:51,819
99% perspiration so you've got ideas

716
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:54,100
coming out the yin-yang but how do you

717
00:32:51,819 --> 00:32:55,839
execute them we were talking about that

718
00:32:54,099 --> 00:32:58,139
once we finished the event we all fell

719
00:32:55,839 --> 00:33:00,549

735
00:33:39,819 --> 00:33:42,730
just how about like it was nice to

736
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:44,290
actually have that out for the

737
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:46,390
conference oh yeah it was necessary and

738
00:33:44,289 --> 00:33:48,519
in fact it was kind of one of the keys

739
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:49,600
that one day when these conferences

740
00:33:48,519 --> 00:33:51,460
because at the end of the conference

741
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:53,199
although you saw us puffing down in

742
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:55,120
there we were really the only ones and

743
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:57,309
we left after that and I'm sure it was

744
00:33:55,119 --> 00:33:59,859
just alcohol after that it was wouldn't

745
00:33:57,309 --> 00:34:02,470
it be an amazing that one day those

746
00:33:59,859 --> 00:34:04,539
conferences have the vapor bar and the

747
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:06,370
smoking area and then they also have

748
00:34:04,539 --> 00:34:07,509
medals and they also have you know if

749
00:34:06,369 --> 00:34:10,179
you want to have your alcohol as well

750
00:34:07,509 --> 00:34:11,679

751
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:13,539
have to try to pull that one off I think

752
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:17,500

00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:52,030
6:00 and while I walked away from my

786
00:35:49,539 --> 00:35:54,130
booth these boxes that were sealed seven

787
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:54,910
of them and you guys know who you are

788

over there

789
00:35:54,909 --> 00:35:59,409
you opened up the boxes and stole

790
00:35:56,650 --> 00:36:01,360
basically all my meditators there was a

791
00:35:59,409 --> 00:36:04,420
display but they weren't open there was

792
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:06,550
boxes and I guess it is what it is and

793
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:09,809
that was one part of the negative part

794
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:09,810
for me about the conference was

795
00:36:19,869 --> 00:36:24,440
and we didn't give a lot of weightless

796
00:36:22,849 --> 00:36:27,410
growing pains it was nice and everybody

797
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:29,869
liked it and I made the promise paper

798
00:36:27,409 --> 00:36:31,159
today we'll then the Med Tanner guys so

799
00:36:29,869 --> 00:36:33,190
you don't want that get the big gun in

800
00:36:31,159 --> 00:36:36,230
the back so thank you very much because

801
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:39,099
it was just horrible good products I

802
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:44,659
think on the right hands probably that

803
00:36:39,099 --> 00:36:47,298
was how good did your head taste if mine

804
00:36:44,659 --> 00:36:49,429
tasted as well as good as it did oh that

805
00:36:47,298 --> 00:36:53,179
was amazing that's the barb oh my god

806
00:36:49,429 --> 00:36:55,118
and the barb I find when you do a

807
00:36:53,179 --> 00:36:57,889
ridiculously huge head of the bargain

808
00:36:55,119 --> 00:37:02,210
there's almost a reason to do it just

809
00:36:57,889 --> 00:37:03,949
for the taste first part of it I mean

810
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:06,440
Joan and I are well past like trying to

811
00:37:03,949 --> 00:37:08,058

812
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:09,409
our 20s and it's fun and it's awesome

813
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:11,809
you guys should keep doing it for sure

814
00:37:09,409 --> 00:37:13,730
just keep hitting those huge ribs and

815
00:37:11,809 --> 00:37:15,410
you know that's your the biggest rip you

816
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:17,119
can box in the two layers but it does

817
00:37:15,409 --> 00:37:18,858
get to a point where you acquire your

818
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:21,829
stash and you have your medicine all the

819
00:37:18,858 --> 00:37:24,670
time in full melts around it you can

820
00:37:21,829 --> 00:37:24,670
just have it whenever you want

821
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:30,670
just cool that's it I mean that hit was

822
00:37:29,778 --> 00:37:35,719
a destroyer

823
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:38,420
for most yeah yeah just like take one of

824
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:46,129
those and then like try to like do your

825
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:48,259
taxes or no you know what you turn let's

826
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:50,240
try editing this video no no we get on

827
00:37:48,259 --> 00:37:54,108
Facebook and we laugh at people doesn't

828
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:56,508
know exactly the video that I'm editing

829
00:37:54,108 --> 00:37:58,219
right now is the video we're filming

830
00:37:56,509 --> 00:38:00,230
right now so trippy is that that's

831
00:37:58,219 --> 00:38:02,239
pretty cool yeah it's just a ending of

832
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:04,719
this video we'd like to stay slightly

833
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:07,758
ahead of our time just like Panasonic

834
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:10,259
that's their motto is that just just

835
00:38:07,759 --> 00:38:12,240
just slightly ahead of our time

836
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:13,890
Panasonic if you're too far ahead of

837
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:18,679
your time it's your panel summer coming

838
00:38:13,889 --> 00:38:18,679
well not really I have one katasonych

839
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:26,190
yeah but I'm like a little bit more than

840
00:38:24,659 --> 00:38:27,719
slightly ahead of my time I've always

841
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:32,220
been just a little bit too much ahead of

842
00:38:27,719 --> 00:38:35,250
my time and then it kind of misses some

843
00:38:32,219 --> 00:38:40,199
jobs like having the vapor bar in 2002

844
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:41,489
in Vancouver like ten years before so

845
00:38:40,199 --> 00:38:42,809
what's gonna be probably like what

846
00:38:41,489 --> 00:38:44,279
should we think right now tell everybody

847
00:38:42,809 --> 00:38:46,289
because we got to make this popular now

848
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:48,750
and not ten years well let me think

849
00:38:46,289 --> 00:38:50,279
what's the next thing that I'm feeling

850
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:52,829
is really well you know what

851
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:54,210
mark low-key nailed it with mega L pizza

852
00:38:52,829 --> 00:38:56,069
I think he's doing a great job with that

853
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:57,480
medicated pizza and medicated truths

854
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:59,789
about a catered food across the country

855
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:02,880
I've got another friend who's basically

856
00:38:59,789 --> 00:39:05,130
doing one and it's not really my thing

857
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:07,079
to say on camera but he's got another

858
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:10,410
idea that's very similar but different

859
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:12,539
doesn't involve pizza at all and it's a

860
00:39:10,409 --> 00:39:13,559
great great idea great concept and so

861
00:39:12,539 --> 00:39:15,869
hopefully we'll be able to talk about

862
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:18,420
that soon once he's organized himself

863
00:39:15,869 --> 00:39:20,190
into getting kind of closer to effect

864
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:21,780
well you'd hate to give a great idea way

865
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:23,730
up on camera and just have someone

866
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:25,380
that's what was yesterday was always

867
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:26,699
there was a lot of great ideas at this

868
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:29,190
conference that people want to invest

869
00:39:26,699 --> 00:39:31,079
into to make these great ideas bigger I

870
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:32,909
had three people approached me at the

871
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:34,739
conference and you know say that they

872
00:39:32,909 --> 00:39:35,969
thought that they could help mean you

873
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:39,809
know make a lot of money in this

874
00:39:35,969 --> 00:39:41,849
business and whatnot but I just sort of

875
00:39:39,809 --> 00:39:45,389
was like polite and took their cards but

876
00:39:41,849 --> 00:39:50,569
didn't I'm not really it it feels

877
00:39:45,389 --> 00:39:52,559
strange it feels strange when someone

878
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:54,360
approaches you that way probably because

879
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:56,099
I've never been really approached that

880
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:59,039
way I've been approached for my skills

881
00:39:56,099 --> 00:40:00,940
like photography or consulting to make

882
00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:05,050
hash or something but never

883
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:07,659
like just someone that wanted to use the

884
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:08,740
name that I've built for myself you know

885
00:40:07,659 --> 00:40:10,059
what I mean like I've never had anyone

886
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:11,368
approaching you that way so it felt a

887
00:40:10,059 --> 00:40:13,539
little bit weird

888
00:40:11,369 --> 00:40:15,099
for me my perspective even though I

889
00:40:13,539 --> 00:40:16,509
could see from from a certain

890
00:40:15,099 --> 00:40:17,680
perspective it could be very exciting

891
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:21,810
like oh my god this could be my big

892
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:25,568
break but I just sort of let it you know

893
00:40:21,809 --> 00:40:28,210
let it sit and just kind of move forward

894
00:40:25,568 --> 00:40:32,108
I mean John is smart the way he got

895
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:34,838
involved with next-gen next-gen is all

896
00:40:32,108 --> 00:40:36,068
about education and conferences I think

897
00:40:34,838 --> 00:40:37,719
they're going to be doing an analytical

898
00:40:36,068 --> 00:40:39,130
company which will all be all about

899
00:40:37,719 --> 00:40:42,519
testing and doing all these other things

900
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:44,920
so for John it's communication and he's

901
00:40:42,519 --> 00:40:48,369
not he hasn't sold his name to anyone

902
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:50,409
he's not like backing an LP or you know

903
00:40:48,369 --> 00:40:52,030
anything he's he's just John BIRT fellow

904
00:40:50,409 --> 00:40:54,129
that it's not one that you think you

905
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:55,119
guys who without John I wouldn't have

906
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:56,050
been at the conference

907
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,818
Jodi wouldn't have been at the

908
00:40:56,050 --> 00:41:01,269
conference Curtis all wooden bed the

909
00:40:57,818 --> 00:41:02,769
conference he brought and and quite a

910
00:41:01,269 --> 00:41:04,719
few people came up to me and said oh you

911
00:41:02,769 --> 00:41:07,300
know it's really neat that this this

912
00:41:04,719 --> 00:41:09,098
part this middle part of this conference

913
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:10,750
brought me to the conference like I

914
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:11,380
don't know any of these financial people

915
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:14,858
and it just

916
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:16,869
if these names brought me and I you know

917
00:41:14,858 --> 00:41:18,098
was about three but you picked it you

918
00:41:16,869 --> 00:41:21,430
had a group of people out of the

919
00:41:18,099 --> 00:41:22,510
business or out of our scene into that

920
00:41:21,429 --> 00:41:24,098
business you have you have a lot of

921
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:26,350
friends in it you can I into 20

922
00:41:24,099 --> 00:41:28,750
different people

923
00:41:26,349 --> 00:41:30,489
know so much I'm gonna pioneer then and

924
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:32,530
I look up to a lot with your skills out

925
00:41:30,489 --> 00:41:34,059
there and I'd like to see what we have

926
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:36,490
to offer to this industry in which

927
00:41:34,059 --> 00:41:38,889
someone all of us do we all have a

928
00:41:36,489 --> 00:41:40,929
different aspect but I think these are

929
00:41:38,889 --> 00:41:43,059
the people that people are listening to

930
00:41:40,929 --> 00:41:44,409
in the financial guys here our names -

931
00:41:43,059 --> 00:41:46,539
none of the guys talking about

932
00:41:44,409 --> 00:41:48,460
hey we watch your [ __ ] my videos hey

933
00:41:46,539 --> 00:41:50,110
I could make you a lot of money and that

934
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:51,429
was funny we know software is that I

935
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:54,460
just came up from the US I think I've

936
00:41:51,429 --> 00:41:56,230
seen that all areas so it was it was

937
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:57,880
kind of cool that people are paying

938
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:59,860
attention to exactly what we're doing

939
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:02,019
we're educating one another and now the

940
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:04,570
people that really need the education I

941
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:06,099
mean another and we're edging and we're

942
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:08,200
bringing more people in that are

943
00:42:06,099 --> 00:42:10,119
educating they want to get the education

944
00:42:08,199 --> 00:42:12,250
and it's being able to great to be able

945
00:42:10,119 --> 00:42:14,079
to actually just be involved and bring

946
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:16,809
everybody together it's not a cool like

947
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:18,039
we're all inspiration it was cool this

948
00:42:16,809 --> 00:42:19,420
there's no doubt about it

949
00:42:18,039 --> 00:42:21,309
it was cool and you know you know we

950
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:22,780
came this inspiration you know what this

951
00:42:21,309 --> 00:42:25,809
just talked about gives you going a few

952
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:27,730
people said that Michelle Rainey a group

953
00:42:25,809 --> 00:42:30,759
of people together we can obviously do

954
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:32,650
this this way and you know my Michelle

955
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:34,750
is great she was one of the big

956
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:36,670
inspirations of Y for for me why my

957
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:38,650
moment was involved with this conference

958
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:40,420
was was something that I remember it was

959
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:41,829
about me bringing that medical aspect

960
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:43,210
she would have been all over this five

961
00:42:41,829 --> 00:42:45,400
hundred percent that's what I mean it

962
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:47,949
got these moms think about that yeah or

963
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:50,950
stuff like that bro she gave me that

964
00:42:47,949 --> 00:42:52,809
inspiration that was just I actually say

965
00:42:50,949 --> 00:42:54,699
thank you to Michelle for being a big

966
00:42:52,809 --> 00:42:56,920
part of the inspiration of where I am

967
00:42:54,699 --> 00:42:59,919
right now - Michelle Rainey for those of

968
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:02,409
you that don't know she was a bank

969
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:04,780
teller that Marc Emery often went to the

970
00:43:02,409 --> 00:43:06,940
bank and dealt with and they had

971
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:09,220
interactions and they spoke and he

972
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:11,289
learned over the I don't know if it was

973
00:43:09,219 --> 00:43:13,209
months or a year over a year but he

974
00:43:11,289 --> 00:43:15,309
learned that she had promised

975
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:17,860
and I don't know if he had turned her

976
00:43:15,309 --> 00:43:19,570
onto cannabis or probably he did but

977
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:21,280
maybe she was using it before but anyway

978
00:43:19,570 --> 00:43:23,410
he eventually pulled her out of that job

979
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:26,050
and said come work for me and Michelle

980
00:43:23,409 --> 00:43:27,730
really held together cannabis culture

981
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:30,160
and all these things not so much

982
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:32,590
cannabis culture but the the BC MP the

983
00:43:30,159 --> 00:43:34,659
the bookstore at most she always was a

984
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:37,450
pleasure to deal with with fresh heavies

985
00:43:34,659 --> 00:43:39,460
orders she promoted bubble bags huge she
