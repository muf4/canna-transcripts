the the Banger M festival and that was

79
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,480

80
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,759
incredible just an incredible run of of

81
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:54,840

first time but it was one of the longest

87
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:05,878
ones they did and I guess it was a

88
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,200
special enough one that they felt they

89
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:09,919

118
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:23,959
message yesterday from Ian Davidson and

119
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,759
he I've been trying to get him on to

120
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:28,399
Hash church for a long time to come and

121
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:31,160
share all of his incredible knowledge on

122
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:33,079
not only like growing in green houses

123
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:35,600
but also like starting the tissue

124
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:39,038
culture company and kind of getting into

125
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:42,280
the explanation of initiation

126
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:45,719
and um you know

127
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:47,478
multiplication and Meemic propag

128
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,960
micropropagation basically everything I

129
00:05:47,478 --> 00:05:54,199
learned about tissue culture like 95% of

130
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:56,279
it has come uh from from Ian and

131
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:57,759
probably another probably 5% of it came

132
00:05:56,279 --> 00:06:00,239
from Chimera because he was talking

133
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:02,520
about it almost 20 years ago uh way

134
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,360
before anyone was I guess really able to

135
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:07,279
make it economically viable as a

136
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:12,000
business I know skunkman Sam as well had

137
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:14,000
done it 25 plus years ago uh so it would

138
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,839
have been good to have him on he's

139
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,720
impossible to get on in the weekends

140
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:20,318
because he's got a little girl uh that

141
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,199
he spends his time with his daughter but

142
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,160
um he he said last night he was going to

143
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:25,598
try and make it in so I'm really hoping

144
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,280
today he's going to be able to come in

145
00:06:25,598 --> 00:06:30,399
and share with us uh some good stuff on

146
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:31,839
tissue culture

147
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,638
but otherwise we can chill out and puff

148
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:35,079
some

149
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,000
bowls we'll do that regardless yeah I

150
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:39,918
had a I knew a group in central

151
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,240
California who did that a decade ago but

152
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:43,839
W they had brought in a woman from South

153
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,240
Africa who had did it in South Africa

154
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:49,198
for 27 years and just after she did it

155
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:53,280
she's like okay I'm going to retire now

156
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:55,560
goodbye oh wow so they couldn't continue

157
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:56,758
it they basically had it started and

158
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:00,079
they had to let it die because they

159
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:02,400
couldn't perpetuate it yeah so

160
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:04,478
with with tit culture do you guys like

161
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:07,120

that um you know the main theme that I

167
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:23,839
keep being told is it will replace your

168
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:26,759
mother room now is that something that

169
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:29,918
it that everyone feels like the

170
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:32,199
techniques and and the

171
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:34,038
I guess the Sops that you would follow

172
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:36,520
are are that solid that we would not

173
00:07:34,038 --> 00:07:38,159
have to keep live plants any longer or

174
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:40,598
would you say that we would want to keep

175
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,199
maybe both at the same time what what

176
00:07:40,598 --> 00:07:44,959
are your thoughts on that kind of stuff

177
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:50,080
as somebody who's worked with h tissue

178
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:53,799
culture I can say that uh when you

179
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:57,439
reproduce uh mems under tissue culture

180
00:07:53,800 --> 00:08:01,120
so in a glass container with egg or

181
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:04,399
angger or whatever your formula for for

182
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:07,079
nutrients uh one of the problems is

183
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:11,318
every few years you really need to take

184
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:13,918
the plants out and refresh them by

185
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:18,720
growing them as a big plant and taking

186
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:23,000
fresh new pieces so I mean it definitely

187
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:26,520
takes up less room uh but and if you're

188
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:30,879
big enough it may make economic sense uh

189
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:34,559
but Ian at SRA is the to talk to about

190
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:37,000
this and uh yeah anybody who's

191
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:39,639
interested can't

192
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,278
wait I hope he I hope he shows up I'm

193
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:43,439
really go

194
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:45,639
ahead it's an interesting discussion

195
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,680
because the uh uh it was perpetuated in

196
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:49,240
a lab so I always thought about that

197
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:52,079
what would you do would you maintain the

198
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:54,720
genetic but as well as you know keep it

199
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,600
perpetually going you know my thought

200
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,399
would always keep some sort of backup

201
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:01,000
data always I mean I have that problem

202
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,958
with the computer so exactly the only

203
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,240
thing I would think of to do would be to

204
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:09,599
maintain that same situation with jeans

205
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,360
because you know if electricity goes out

206
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,320
and then you know the chamber that

207
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,879
that's stored in dies you know now what

208
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,560
you crack start from those start

209
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:20,559
collecting genetics from other people

210
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:23,799
you know I think I think one of the

211
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:27,319
great I think one of the great ways is

212
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:29,759
um um maintaining it under like very

213
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:31,278
small pieces of it just the tissue it

214
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:33,799
doesn't even have to be the living plant

215
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:36,360
and you can you can maintain that on um

216
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:39,599
in liquid nitrogen in a very small

217
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:41,399
inexpensive method and I think that way

218
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,959
you can really get into redundancies

219
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:45,000
where you could have two or three

220
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:47,599
different sites where you maintain your

221
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,600
library and it takes up a very very

222
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,720
small amount of room versus how much

223
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,159
room it would take for um you know you

224
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,720
know you to keep those mothers but I'm

225
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:58,120
in the same boat I don't think it's

226
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:00,000
gotten quite to the point yet you know

227
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:02,679
and it's also when we compare comp it to

228
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,200
strawberries or raspberries they don't

229
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:07,120
seem to have the same variation when it

230
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,278
comes to commercial production you know

231
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:12,078
you've got your one banana and your your

232
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:13,838
driscolls does like your one strawberry

233
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:15,078
and it's this one sort of cultivar that

234
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,480
everyone's just kind of like oh I'm

235
00:10:15,078 --> 00:10:18,199
happy I'll just buy the Driscoll

236
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,039
strawberries I think they grew 10

237
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,720
billion plantlets this year all over the

238
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:24,480
world in different parts of the world so

239
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,000
from the for from those companies

240
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,360
perspectives obviously it's going to be

241
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,839
a lot easier to keep a plant that's one

242
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,800
single genetic we come from the Cannabis

243
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,440
industry where you know on average I'm

244
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:39,719
sure we're going to want to have at

245
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:42,120
least 500 plus genetics kept alive maybe

246
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,720
it's a thousand maybe it's 1500 I don't

247
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,799
know but there's a lot of different

248
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:48,519
varieties of cannabis out there little

249
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:51,479
variations in phenotypes and you know

250
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:54,480
losing those from a cannabis connoisseur

251
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:57,079
perspective is is is frightening you you

252
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,720
know you really you want to maintain you

253
00:10:57,078 --> 00:11:01,000
know all those flavors and all those

254
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,920
different effects and when you think of

255
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,639
the Nostalgia that occurs in an old

256
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:06,919
school puffer when they're like oh yeah

257
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:08,519
we used to get this one thing and I mean

258
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:11,000
I've asked Sam how many times people

259
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:12,320
have asked him about the roadkill skunk

260
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,320
oh what whatever happened to the

261
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,879
roadkill skunk like we have Nostalgia

262
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:21,200
over these different flavors and it's um

263
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:24,759
Road Hill Road Hill skunk actually got

264
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:27,680
ran over on the road and uh doesn't

265
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:30,399
exist anymore yeah I'm feeling you on

266
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:32,078
that one

267
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,240
well you said you you heard it here

268
00:11:32,078 --> 00:11:35,599
first

269
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:39,440
folks it's

270
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:44,320
per it's it's doing this work originally

271
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:47,880
30 years ago was exactly to keep it

272
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:50,399
maintained so I wanted I had 600 clones

273
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:53,559
at that time and keeping them all alive

274
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,600
and maintain was a pain in the butt so I

275
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:59,759
wanted a method where I could take

276
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:03,120
mirums or callus freeze it

277
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:06,919
and keep it the way you're talking about

278
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:10,399
in liquid nitrogen then uh you

279
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:13,599
know like you could have a thousand in a

280
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:15,799
small portable unit it doesn't even have

281
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,000
to be liquid nitrogen because you can

282
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:21,278
get freezers that are minus 50 really

283
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,440
easy I think that'll do

284
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:26,039
it yeah it in in m to Marcus's point

285
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:28,279
it's it's frightening to lose some of

286
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:30,120
these varieties I mean it's you know the

287
00:12:28,278 --> 00:12:32,039
the security that always had was to give

288
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:34,120
it to your closest buddies and and make

289
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:35,639
sure that you know if if anything were

290
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:38,519
to happen you could at least call upon

291
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:40,399
them but it's you know we're so we're so

292
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:42,519
far from that now you know the the

293
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,759
paradigm's really shifted you know 1800

294
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:45,919
square feet of moms you're not going to

295
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:49,000
be sharing 1800 square feet of of cuts

296
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:52,838
you know it's tough what I was was I'm

297
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:58,000
sure many more varieties than exist now

298
00:12:52,839 --> 00:13:01,440
have been lost in the past think about

299
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,600
it yeah got some good news it's good

300
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:08,199
point it's a good way to put it I like

301
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:11,959
good news so I got word from ebony

302
00:13:08,198 --> 00:13:15,159
Worley who is Shan Worley who is the

303
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:18,119
veteran arrested in Alabama for

304
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:21,278
traveling through with cannabis and our

305
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:24,839
our group the uh veterans Action Council

306
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:26,799
actually sent a letter to Alabama full

307
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:30,399
of a whole bunch of people who have

308
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:33,000
served saying let him out let him go

309
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,919
and uh ebony let us go that let us know

310
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:39,120
that Alabama is going to be releasing

311
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:42,799
him uh on parole so we got some positive

312
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:46,639
news there and on the same side we got

313
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:48,958
some bad news um friend of mine at the

314
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:52,440
veterans uh virtual happy hour Jose

315
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:54,599
Balon and them were vying for uh a

316
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:57,279
reschedule uh and they applied to the

317
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:59,240
Supreme Court of the United States and

318
00:13:57,278 --> 00:14:01,519
got all the way through to there and and

319
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:04,519
then uh this week the Supreme Court

320
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:07,159
decided not to hear the case so

321
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:10,560
unfortunately um the you know

322
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:12,439
rescheduling that we tried for Vi for

323
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:14,638
unfortunately again it was on

324
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:17,880
hypotheticals where the court wants to

325
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:19,919
see you actually be you know damaged or

326
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:23,120
hurt by the proceedings somewhere along

327
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:25,919
the lines and they just threw it out so

328
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:28,000
we got to try again yeah you got to try

329
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:29,639
again and wait till after the Democrats

330
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,879
win and pack

331
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:37,079
Supreme Court then use it with facts

332
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:38,720
instead of theory and you'll do it right

333
00:14:37,078 --> 00:14:40,319
and that's what we're trying to use

334
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,800
we've assembled the veterans from across

335
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,560
the United States and we're going to use

336
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:50,278
our power to you know go after uh Biden

337
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:50,278
to work on a Bo Biden medical marijuana

338
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,480
bill you know because his son as even he

339
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,039
spoke of could even have used it so

340
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,320
we're going to not stop we're going to

341
00:14:58,039 --> 00:15:01,120
embarrass them we're going to use our

342
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:03,440
power and our voices to continue the

343
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,519
pressure so you know two steps forward

344
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,600
One Step pack take it on the chin

345
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:11,039
regroup reorganize and fight

346
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,800
again but but Mr Worley's going home so

347
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:15,759
you know that least some good news a

348
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:18,120
drug war prisoner is going home and dude

349
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:21,320
when the [ __ ] does anyone ever get let

350
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:24,919
out of prison in in like

351
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:28,519
Louisiana it's Alabama too Alabama so

352
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:28,519
yeah it was a

353
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:35,078
yeah I mean it was hard finding him

354
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:37,399
councel uh there's a lot of challenges

355
00:15:35,078 --> 00:15:40,159
there because there's no medical defense

356
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:42,440
and he had been busted in Alabama prior

357
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:45,240
and was let go to Arizona to do his

358
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:47,920
parole and he got busted on parole there

359
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:51,519
which is why he went back to Alabama so

360
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:54,120
that he was even to get parole due to

361
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:56,440
this is pretty much a miracle in itself

362
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:59,078
and one we're thankful for and hopefully

363
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:00,360
our pressure helped if not you know then

364
00:15:59,078 --> 00:16:02,799
matter we're going to continue to use

365
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:05,399
whatever voices we have to help people

366
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:07,758
who are still hurt so you know don't

367
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:10,000
forget if you're free send the elevator

368
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:12,440
back down help out people brothers and

369
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,120
sisters are still in jail for this so

370
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:16,839
sharing is caring which reminds me to

371
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:20,318
give a big shout out to one of my

372
00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:24,440
mentors Ron hickey my my good old buddy

373
00:16:20,318 --> 00:16:27,360
Ron who recently sent me two beautiful 5

374
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:29,720
foot tall congales plants and I guess

375
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,519
it's full circle cuz five or six or

376
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:33,680
seven or eight years ago I don't know

377
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:36,039
when whenever I started really giving

378
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:37,719
the Congo away uh he was one of the

379
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:39,679
first people I actually gave it

380
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:41,519
to uh you know it was kind of a

381
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:43,958
controlled cultivar for a while some

382
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:46,159
people felt like they were going to keep

383
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:48,119
this cultivar and and really control

384
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:49,759
this cultivar and make seeds and sell it

385
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:52,759
and make the money and I kind of put the

386
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:54,959
kibos on that by giving it away to I to

387
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:58,199
everyone literally like Dr Atomic and

388
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:59,679

talking about the Congo and I got that

414
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,720
cut a couple years back when we went up

415
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:05,759
there to do the regen conference in

416
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:07,960
Vancouver it trickled its way down and

417
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:09,480
um I've been pollinating with it I've

418
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:12,360
got a few rounds of pollination on it

419
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:14,319
and it's it's a cool Plant Man the are

420
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:16,719
we the Robert's Creek one I guess is the

421
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:19,279
one we're probably all talking about

422
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,720
yeah yeah I mean I I go I call it Lano

423
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:23,200
Negra cut because it was my friend Alex

424
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:25,640
who actually collected it from the

425
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,919
pygmies in the Congo then it went to

426
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:29,679
reeferman and reeferman I think ended up

427
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:31,440
taking it to the Sun Sunshine Coast and

428
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:34,038
then people on the Sunshine Coast got

429
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,759
control of it and then you had you had

430
00:18:34,038 --> 00:18:38,558
your Green Supreme and your Al The

431
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:40,599
Alchemist and befriended Lano negro's

432
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:42,879
wife Raina genga and started trying to

433
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:45,599
control this plant that just needed to

434
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:47,600
be shared it needed to be gifted it

435
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:50,000
needed to be given to people because it

436
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:52,678
it is a really unique cultivar it has a

437
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,079
nice you know I've heard it has thcv in

438

stacking Congo here Cali what's the

469
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:14,279
profile like i' I've had the tpin I

470
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:16,400
believe uh from the Blue River tpin

471
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:19,038
Marcus of the Congo but I've not smoked

472
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,880
the flour or hash from it what what's

473
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:24,319
the what's the profile it's very exotic

474
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:27,000
it's very tarpine it's very like

475
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:29,279
perfumey it's uh it's just something

476
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,519
different than what you you constantly

477
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:32,960
get with the gases and the fruits and

478
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:35,798
all these different sort of musky

479
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:38,679
flavors the Congo is definitely a

480
00:20:35,798 --> 00:20:40,319
special one it's uh I got a big bag of

481
00:20:38,679 --> 00:20:42,440
it right now actually I'm pretty excited

482
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:44,839
to start uh to start squishing it I

483
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:46,279
squished the hash church last night and

484
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:48,558
made a little bit of rosin but I think

485
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:51,000
today maybe even during church I might

486
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:53,720
press out a little Congo with my little

487
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,480
bit of nug that I got left how much of

488
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:58,200
that hash Church did you press and how

489
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:00,079
much came out I pressed a very small

490
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:02,080
amount and I didn't get a ton but I

491
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:07,359
pressed it on my Helix Pro and I didn't

492
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:08,879
have it um sort of uh tied to my table

493
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:10,439
with these you need a really proper

494
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,640
table because when you crank the last

495
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:16,038
little bit where you go from about 8,000

496
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:17,679
lb up to like 14,000 lbs you really need

497
00:21:16,038 --> 00:21:20,440
it to be steady so I couldn't really get

498
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:23,240
it much over 10,000 and it was low I

499
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:27,080
mean I got I put in four grams and I got

500
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:30,558
out like 0.5 so it was about like

501
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:33,319
12% uh but then I did hit it a second

502
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:36,038
time and I actually didn't collect the

503
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:40,240
rosin from the second Cress so I'm

504
00:21:36,038 --> 00:21:42,879
guessing it's probably around like 18%

505
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:46,278
he said he got around 20 to 22% when he

506
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:48,640
pressed uh when he pressed Rosen um it

507
00:21:46,278 --> 00:21:50,759
makes me a little suspicious as to how

508
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,120
it can be so resinous maybe it is these

509
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:56,119
hooked tricomes I'm going to get in on

510
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:58,079
the bud later today and photograph it it

511
00:21:56,119 --> 00:21:59,079
really reminds me of an old cultivar I

512
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:01,119
used to grow

513
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:03,558
years back like I'm talking almost 30

514
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:06,558
years ago from Holland that I got called

515
00:22:03,558 --> 00:22:08,000
Dutch Treat and it was it's I've never

516
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:09,798
seen another Dutch Treat that looked

517
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,200
like this one it was just coated in res

518
00:22:09,798 --> 00:22:14,798
and it had a really musky kind of like

519
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:16,798
almost hash plant smell so for me I've

520
00:22:14,798 --> 00:22:18,599
got a little Nostalgia on it I love the

521
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:20,558
way the plant looks and I'm still going

522
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:22,959
to wash it see how much the Melt comes

523
00:22:20,558 --> 00:22:25,399
out what kind of yields I get uh and I'm

524
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:29,480
pretty excited about it actually it's

525
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:32,519
pretty nice H um I wanted to hop in back

526
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:34,240
on the um the Congo before we moved on I

527
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:37,599
was just on the phone with a vision

528
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:39,558
Creator last week um talking about the

529
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:40,798
Congo and he and I can't remember his

530
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:43,798
partner's name but they're working with

531
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:46,480
a university up there in BC and they've

532
00:22:43,798 --> 00:22:49,119
done S1 line of it that they are just

533
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,640
about to release they have 1500 seeds I

534
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:53,558
think of s1's they're going to release

535
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,480
on that so wow just maybe maybe give a

536
00:22:53,558 --> 00:22:56,678
follow out to Vision Creator if you guys

537
00:22:55,480 --> 00:23:00,360
are interested in getting a hold of

538
00:22:56,679 --> 00:23:01,440
those genetics he's been in the chat

539
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:02,798
yeah he's been really cool I mean he's

540
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,519
the one that was getting it out to to

541
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:07,918
all of us you know and it trickled out

542
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:09,599
too in my kind of circle here so yeah

543
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:11,880
that's awesome that's awesome you know

544
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:14,199
it's one of those cuts especially now

545
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:16,640
where legality isn't really a problem I

546
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:18,600
generally just if I have it I give it to

547
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:21,000
whoever asks me for it I just I can't

548
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:22,839
imagine being like you know one one of

549
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,558
my one of the guys that likes to control

550
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:26,119
this cul ofar and I won't call him out

551
00:23:24,558 --> 00:23:27,759
because it's just makes him sound like

552
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:30,038
such a piece of [ __ ] but he was kind of

553
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:31,798
like you know I got to make sure uh I

554
00:23:30,038 --> 00:23:33,919
got to make sure that uh you know the

555
00:23:31,798 --> 00:23:35,400
person is worthy and I'm like whoa like

556
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:37,080
dude like that is everything that's

557
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:39,278
wrong in the world right now like the

558
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:41,639
person is worthy like what if the person

559
00:23:39,278 --> 00:23:43,558
isn't worthy but his little girl is

560
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:45,400
worthy and is having seizures and needs

561
00:23:43,558 --> 00:23:48,798
this cultivar to stop those seizures

562
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:52,080
like why do we create these reasons to

563
00:23:48,798 --> 00:23:53,879
not to be greedy and to maintain control

564
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:55,839
over something as awesome as a cannabis

565
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:59,120
cultivar it's like listen I get it if

566
00:23:55,839 --> 00:24:00,599
you spent 20 years in 10 or 10 years in

567
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:03,439
your greenhouse and you collected the

568
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:06,119
seeds all I get that but this is a

569
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:08,480
cultivar that was collected in Africa it

570
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:11,000
was meant to be given out as a gift you

571
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:13,839
know the pygmy meant it to be a gift and

572
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,919
it just seems like a strange thing to

573
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:19,959
try and collect and control someone

574
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:23,600
else's work just give that [ __ ] away I I

575
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:27,759
had a I had a variety from the Congo one

576
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:32,839
time was given to the from the pigies to

577
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:37,278
Jean Paul halette who was a uh a famous

578
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:39,558
explorer down there and I I had all

579
00:24:37,278 --> 00:24:43,960
these plans to grow massive amounts of

580
00:24:39,558 --> 00:24:47,558
it and I I had a logo all picked out get

581
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:51,880
small but uh the problem was the weed

582
00:24:47,558 --> 00:24:51,879
just didn't cut it your Congo

583
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:57,079
[Music]

584
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,960
is can I ask you this Sam because you

585
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,918
you're probably the guy that's gone

586
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,600
through the biggest

587
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:01,919
populations you know like when when I

588
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:03,038
was hear Marcus say that I was thinking

589
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,240
you know well that's usually someone

590
00:25:03,038 --> 00:25:05,599
that has a lot of insecurities it's

591
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,798
holding on to something and as I've

592
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:10,599
started to run through larger sifts you

593
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:12,000
know a 500,000 I've gotten really

594
00:25:10,599 --> 00:25:13,158
confident that I don't I don't really

595
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,798
kind I'm kind of sitting in this

596
00:25:13,159 --> 00:25:16,840
position right now and maybe it's it's

597
00:25:14,798 --> 00:25:19,599
an immature position to be in but I feel

598
00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:22,079
like I don't need anyone specific Elite

599
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:24,558
cut I can find enough stuff if I go

600
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:26,639
through big enough populations and so I

601
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:27,960
guess that the question is do you find

602
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,320
that to be true or do you still think

603
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:32,159
that it's it's like yeah those Elites

604
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:35,000
are Elites and they they're outliers

605
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:36,679
what do you consider a big population I

606
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,240
don't know you tell me I mean I it could

607
00:25:36,679 --> 00:25:40,919
be whatever it could be a thousand it

608
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:43,519
could be 10,000 it could be 20,000 you

609
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:47,600
know yeah well at

610
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:51,599
20,000 you uh will probably get a very

611
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:56,319
elite cut in in a in a closet with 10

612
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:59,079
plants you're lucky to get an elite

613
00:25:56,319 --> 00:26:00,759
cut right

614
00:25:59,079 --> 00:26:04,278
absolutely

615
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:06,759
agree they tried to do the same thing

616
00:26:04,278 --> 00:26:09,319
with OG Kush you know where they uh you

617
00:26:06,759 --> 00:26:11,158
know people tried to hold on to it and

618
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:13,398
it people swore and it wasn't until the

619
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:15,559
person who made that original swear died

620
00:26:13,398 --> 00:26:18,678
that it finally made its propagation out

621
00:26:15,558 --> 00:26:20,759
through the 90s and made its way out so

622
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:23,840
yeah I've never understood the

623
00:26:20,759 --> 00:26:26,398
absolute sentencing of a of a of a

624
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:29,199
genetic to private use and nobody

625
00:26:26,398 --> 00:26:33,119
getting access to it sorry there's also

626
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:35,360
different ways to uh pass things out if

627
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:38,199
if you felt you worked for years and

628
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:42,119
years in selection and selection to get

629
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:45,360
a particular cut then make seeds and

630
00:26:42,119 --> 00:26:47,759
sell those I mean you can make millions

631
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:50,319
of seeds and pass it out to the

632
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:53,000
community and everybody that wants one

633
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:54,918
can get one what I like is that you

634
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,440
actually speak from experience when you

635
00:26:54,919 --> 00:27:01,038
said you can make millions of seeds I

636
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:03,919
thought that [ __ ] has done this

637
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:07,798
already I have done it many

638
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:09,759
times how about sweet skunk cross with

639
00:27:07,798 --> 00:27:12,359
congales sweet

640
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:15,398
skunk

picking yellow foots actually

651
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:43,640
shantell's and uh a horse was walking

652
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:45,960
through the forest at first we thought

653
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:48,679
it was a wild horse but it actually had

654
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:50,159
had a person with it but uh it reminded

655
00:27:48,679 --> 00:27:53,640
me of you I know how much your daughter

656
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:56,519
likes to uh to ride horses yeah we had

657
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:58,919
some breakouts this morning here but

658
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:00,480
it's all good how's everybody doing

659
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:02,679
we're doing pretty good we got a little

660
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,319
bit into the conversation actually etan

661
00:28:02,679 --> 00:28:05,720
asked a good or maybe it wasn't etan I

662
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:08,678
can't remember who asked the question

663
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:10,480
but it was basically like where are we

664
00:28:08,679 --> 00:28:12,159
in a place with tissue culture in

665
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:15,200
cannabis right now where people oh it

666
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:17,919
was Colin who could that we could get to

667
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:19,360
a point and I mean actually before I ask

668
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:21,399
this question what I would really like

669
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:22,639
Ian is for you to introduce yourself let

670
00:28:21,398 --> 00:28:24,719
everyone know a little bit of your

671
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,960
history in the industry and let them

672
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:30,278
know how you became how you came to

673
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:32,278
start and become a part of uh the tissue

674
00:28:30,278 --> 00:28:35,398
culture company SAR International that

675
00:28:32,278 --> 00:28:38,640
would be a good start actually sure we a

676
00:28:35,398 --> 00:28:39,959
little Spiel here oh hold on what I do

677
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,600
pushing the

678
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:44,360
buttons oh yeah you know I mean probably

679
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:48,038
like most people here have been in this

680
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:50,240
for a long time in California primarily

681
00:28:48,038 --> 00:28:52,839
and uh any you guys have heard of my

682
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:55,679
business I started this company biologic

683
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:56,839
systems and we've got a whole line of

684
00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:00,679
certified

685
00:28:56,839 --> 00:29:02,918
organic uh St amendments and Etc down

686
00:29:00,679 --> 00:29:05,440
here in Cali primarily in

687
00:29:02,919 --> 00:29:07,000
Oregon um so I've done that for a long

688
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,480
time kind of seen the industry through

689
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:12,200
that lens quite a bit and um you know I

690
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:14,480
ended up spending about four years uh

691
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:16,278
down in Santa Barbara County scaling a

692
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,720
fair bit of the several of the big green

693
00:29:16,278 --> 00:29:19,880
houses down there working with these

694
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:23,038
Dutch guys and helping them to kind of

695
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:24,880
figure out uh you know what to do and

696
00:29:23,038 --> 00:29:28,839
you know in that process we scaled up to

697
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:32,440
producing about um uh around 150,000

698
00:29:28,839 --> 00:29:33,839
clones a month and um uh it just really

699
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:36,519
got out of control you know I mean

700
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:38,798
trying to manage a Halfacre of mother

701
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:41,278
plants and trying to do all that you

702
00:29:38,798 --> 00:29:44,480
know with the the pesticides that we

703
00:29:41,278 --> 00:29:47,119
have at hand and and uh it's just a huge

704
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:49,319
Challenge and so you know about four

705
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:51,319
years ago I started looking at tissue

706
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:54,879
culture I mean down in Cali you know we

707
00:29:51,319 --> 00:29:56,079
watch these strawberry Growers come out

708
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,760
and you know they'll plant a million

709
00:29:56,079 --> 00:29:59,639
strawberry plants over a weekend right

710
00:29:57,759 --> 00:30:02,119
all from from TC they all look exactly

711
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:04,000
the same and uh you know that's the way

712
00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:05,599
that their business ticks you know they

713
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,558
got a little jet they're flying around

714
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:09,519
with their tisue culture plants making

715
00:30:07,558 --> 00:30:12,240
it happen you know in all their

716
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:14,079
locations um and so you know the

717
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,519
question was like why can't we do it for

718
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:18,918
cannabis right we can do it for these

719
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:21,278
other plants um and uh so you know I

720
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:23,559
started doing my homework and I spent

721
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:26,038
about a year traveling around the world

722
00:30:23,558 --> 00:30:28,158
I met pretty much every company I could

723
00:30:26,038 --> 00:30:30,798
find that was claiming to do this work

724
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:32,679
on cannabis and learned all about it

725
00:30:30,798 --> 00:30:34,798
along the way I learned the questions

726
00:30:32,679 --> 00:30:38,759
that you ask and you know the the key

727
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:40,839
metrics how the business Works um and uh

728
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:44,000
and then I met the team at SRA in

729
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:46,879
Vancouver there and they really to me

730
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:50,440
seem to be kind of the clear um leader

731
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:52,640
in the in the space um really for two

732
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:54,600
reasons you know our doctor zide that

733
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:57,360
runs our TC program he's been working on

734
00:30:54,599 --> 00:31:00,678
cannabis for 15 years uh under a federal

735
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:03,038
research license in Canada um and then

736
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:05,440
uh you know we also have a genotyping

737
00:31:03,038 --> 00:31:07,278
lab that allows us to do you know we do

738
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:10,360
over a thousand samples a month right

739
00:31:07,278 --> 00:31:13,240
now um just uh checking everything right

740
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:16,000
checking to make sure we don't mix stuff

741
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:18,679
up um you know starting to look and

742
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:21,359
observe at and managing uh somaclonal

743
00:31:18,679 --> 00:31:24,240
variation which is uh you know a huge

744
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:26,319
piece of the uh of the TC puzzle and is

745
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:29,440
really kind of the big risk that's

746
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:31,398
involved in it um if I can elaborate on

747
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,720
that a bit I'm on a little bit of a a

748
00:31:31,398 --> 00:31:34,879
tangent now but it's probably a real

749
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,839
important one um so you know you got all

750
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:40,240
these TC Labs popping up all over for

751
00:31:36,839 --> 00:31:42,359
cannabis right now um and you know what

752
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,558
happens in uh conventional tissue

753
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:46,638
culture you know it's usually around

754
00:31:44,558 --> 00:31:49,398
like four years after making clones from

755
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:51,759
clones from clones in TC uh you start to

756
00:31:49,398 --> 00:31:54,079
see mutation right the plants start to

757
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:55,879
mutate um and uh you know you're you're

758
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:58,079
literally uh you know compounding that

759
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:59,519
clonal process and if there's any kind

760
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:01,079
mutation that happens there's a good

761
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:03,038
chance it can carry on because you're

762
00:32:01,079 --> 00:32:06,158
making these clones so fast from each

763
00:32:03,038 --> 00:32:08,038
other so you know managing that risk

764
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:12,039
like we're seeing in cannabis at about

765
00:32:08,038 --> 00:32:13,759
two years into the process uh that sooc

766
00:32:12,038 --> 00:32:16,319
colonal variation starting to rear its

767
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:18,919
head at like statistically relevant

768
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:20,599
levels um and uh so you know there's a

769
00:32:18,919 --> 00:32:22,919
whole process of how you manage that

770
00:32:20,599 --> 00:32:24,678
right you can isolate shoots you know we

771
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:26,799
have a genotyping lab so we can isolate

772
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:28,798
100 shoots that have not mutated and you

773
00:32:26,798 --> 00:32:30,440
start building a population from those

774
00:32:28,798 --> 00:32:32,679
you ramp that population up and you

775
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:34,200
start ramping down the old population

776
00:32:32,679 --> 00:32:37,320
and that's what they do you know

777
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:39,399
blueberries bananas papayas Etc you know

778
00:32:37,319 --> 00:32:40,960
that's the way that business Works where

779
00:32:39,398 --> 00:32:42,759
you know they all know the mutation is a

780
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:45,200
risk and you watch for it and you

781
00:32:42,759 --> 00:32:47,200
monitor it and you react to it and uh

782
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,038
you can actually manage it now you know

783
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:51,798
if you're running a TC lab and you're

784
00:32:49,038 --> 00:32:53,798
not watching those things and you don't

785
00:32:51,798 --> 00:32:57,278
have the capacity to do that kind of

786
00:32:53,798 --> 00:32:59,359
testing it can be a huge disaster and

787
00:32:57,278 --> 00:33:01,398
we're starting to see that in Cali right

788
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:03,319
now I've seen several of these Labs out

789
00:33:01,398 --> 00:33:04,599
here where they're at about that process

790
00:33:03,319 --> 00:33:05,599
you know they're two years in two and a

791
00:33:04,599 --> 00:33:07,638
half years in and they're starting to

792
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:10,000
see really weird things happening and

793
00:33:07,638 --> 00:33:11,319
they don't really know any idea why or

794
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,359
like the tools to be able to study it

795
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:18,678
and figure out what's going on there um

796
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:20,678
so question that was

797
00:33:18,679 --> 00:33:22,240
awesome would you see the same thing

798
00:33:20,679 --> 00:33:24,120
like that and the say mom's over years

799
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,159
of taking cuts and trying to hold that

800
00:33:24,119 --> 00:33:27,479
Mom say over 10 or 20 years would you

801
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:29,080
see the same in what you're talking

802
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:30,440
about right now because I'm just raising

803
00:33:29,079 --> 00:33:32,678
question to myself as you're talking

804
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:35,000
about that I've had the same strength

805
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:37,960
genetic drift genetic drift 15 years

806
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,079
right 18 years yeah so so genetic drift

807
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:42,880
is when you're going to have that

808
00:33:39,079 --> 00:33:46,439
mutation happen in live plants right

809
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:48,240
outside of TC um however you know our

810
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:50,038
assumption at this point from everything

811
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:53,919
that we see all this research we're

812
00:33:50,038 --> 00:33:57,240
doing right now is that 99% of those

813
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:58,880
symptoms that you're seeing are not

814
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:02,079
mutation

815
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:04,840
they are either viruses or they're inter

816
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:07,000
cellular bacteria right and more than

817
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:08,639
likely the second of those categories

818
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,280
the intercellular bacteria where what

819
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:11,559
that is is when you're making clones

820
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:13,599
right like you say you're the mother

821
00:34:11,559 --> 00:34:15,398
plant and I come in with my razor blades

822
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:17,200
and I'm slicing you up all over the

823
00:34:15,398 --> 00:34:21,118
place you're probably going to get some

824
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:22,559
infections right and uh you know

825
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:24,720
bacteria are going to start working

826
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:27,719
their way in your body so like when we

827
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:30,118
do the tissue culture process with these

828
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:32,439
serial clones like these really really

829
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:35,519
old clones um a couple of the worst have

830
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:38,240
come from yours truly on this call or

831
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:40,759
Marcus truly on this call um you know

832
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:43,118
these old clones they've been they've

833
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:45,919
been cut so many times and each time

834
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:48,358
you're building up this bacterial load

835
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:50,398
and these aren't plant pathogens these

836
00:34:48,358 --> 00:34:52,838
are essentially functioning like a

837
00:34:50,398 --> 00:34:55,319
parasite in the plant it's kind of like

838
00:34:52,838 --> 00:34:57,320
yeast infection right and they slow the

839
00:34:55,320 --> 00:35:00,440
plant down they make the plant's immune

840
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:02,480
system drop um you know and uh and when

841
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:04,079
you do the tissue culture the initiation

842
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,920
process you know we've got a Technique

843
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:07,240
we do that literally migrates all that

844
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,680
stuff out of the plant it looks like

845
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:11,118
snot coming out of the side of the stem

846
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:13,440
and uh and you know there's some tricks

847
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:17,800
you do to just kind of keep sucking it

848
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:21,280
out it's it's really wild so you know so

849
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:23,920
mutation from cloning is very very rare

850
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:25,480
um and it does it does happen absolutely

851
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,760
um but it happens very slowly over the

852
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:30,280
course of time and and uh and from what

853
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:33,079
we can see um from all the genotype

854
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:36,280
testing we're doing in cannabis um we

855
00:35:33,079 --> 00:35:37,480
haven't seen an example yet with a clone

856
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:39,560
uh where we've seen a documented

857
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:42,519
mutation between two clones and any

858
00:35:39,559 --> 00:35:44,078
connection to a symptom so you know what

859
00:35:42,519 --> 00:35:46,559
we all really need to be focused on

860
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:48,400
there is the uh you know the pathogen

861
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:51,400
side of the equation that's really

862
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:53,960
what's causing the problem uh in the

863
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:58,400
cloning you know serial cloning process

864
00:35:53,960 --> 00:36:00,280
can I ask a definition question um T

865
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,160
tissue culture versus like marry stem

866
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:03,920
scrubbing you know I think that a lot

867
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:05,279
lot of people I've heard and this why

868
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,079
I'm asking you can clarify it for me and

869
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:09,160
for everyone else but I've heard a lot

870
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:10,720
of people misuse the word tissue culture

871
00:36:09,159 --> 00:36:11,920
when they're not going to a true tissue

872
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:14,480
culture or they're doing some sort of

873
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:16,358
scrub I don't know can you expl that to

874
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:18,920
me I'm kind of I'm kind of guilty right

875
00:36:16,358 --> 00:36:21,679
here misusing it okay so you know tissue

876
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:24,720
tissue culture is um is a family of

877
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:26,559
Technologies right okay um and so you

878
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:28,318
know the majority of people in the world

879
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:30,719
who are studying the field of plant

880
00:36:28,318 --> 00:36:32,960
tissue culture um they're actually in

881
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:36,000
the genetic engineering World okay so

882
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:39,119
like um there's there's really two forms

883
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,199
that you can execute tissue culture from

884
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:43,760
one is

885
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:46,199
callous right you've got a little blob

886
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,880
of undifferentiated cells like you'll

887
00:36:46,199 --> 00:36:51,199
see in pictures it's a little blob in

888
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:53,960
like a petri dish and those cells um are

889
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:55,519
essentially like stem cells right and

890
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:57,960
that's where you can go and like insert

891
00:36:55,519 --> 00:37:00,079
your pig genes or you know whatever kind

892
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:01,720
of crazy GMO you're trying to do right

893
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:04,760
that all happens through callous tissue

894
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:07,838
culture um which has nothing to do with

895
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:09,599
mass production nodal propagation right

896
00:37:07,838 --> 00:37:11,440
where you start with meristematic tissue

897
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:12,720
culture you isolate the meristem you

898
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,119
know that's what we do you start growing

899
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:16,318
from there and then literally you're

900
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:18,240
making clones from clones from clones

901
00:37:16,318 --> 00:37:20,199
right you'd refer to that as nodal

902
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:23,959
propagation right or you know

903
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:26,519
micropropagation right so so 90% of the

904
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:28,599
field of tissue culture are these got

905
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:31,119
probably more 95 are these guys that are

906
00:37:28,599 --> 00:37:32,720
studying callous tissue culture really

907
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:35,480
with the goal of developing genetically

908
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:38,318
engineered plants the people doing nodal

909
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:40,599
propagation for production is this

910
00:37:38,318 --> 00:37:42,519
really small subset of the business like

911
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:44,440
you know this guy Dr zide that works for

912
00:37:42,519 --> 00:37:46,358
us there's only about a hundred of those

913
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:48,358
guys in the world that know how to

914
00:37:46,358 --> 00:37:51,000
manage these Labs that produce over 10

915
00:37:48,358 --> 00:37:54,279
million plants a year um and it's a it's

916
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:56,480
a you know that world is as much farming

917
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:57,560
as it is a science right like these guys

918
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,280
that know how to run these big

919
00:37:57,559 --> 00:38:00,960
production Labs you know they can look

920
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,240
at a crop of jars like you could

921
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,800
probably look at a room full of edge

922
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:05,919
plants and be like oh they need a little

923
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:08,599
more of this or a little less of that

924
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:10,358
you know so it's um you know it's Art

925
00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:12,559
and Science but yeah the uh you know

926
00:38:10,358 --> 00:38:14,719
there's a whole Suite of Technologies

927
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:16,920
like synthetic seeds and you know it

928
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:19,598
goes on that all of these Technologies

929
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:21,480
fit within the field of tissue culture

930
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:23,640
um but what we're really focused on is

931
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,800
just that micropropagation micro and I

932
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:27,639
didn't understand that I wasn't trying

933
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:29,720
to call you out I just take k no no no

934
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:32,199
that's an important starting point right

935
00:38:29,719 --> 00:38:34,679
it's like we should really be talking

936
00:38:32,199 --> 00:38:36,039
micropropagation the most part so if you

937
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:37,519
know and like you're saying this is

938
00:38:36,039 --> 00:38:39,480
going on in strawberries and I'm hearing

939
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:40,719
you say how how actually small the

940
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:43,838
percentage of people you said that under

941
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:47,919
a 100 people are actually doing M micro

942
00:38:43,838 --> 00:38:50,119
proficiently you know is it I mean is is

943
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:54,079
bger Big lab yeah because there's about

944
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:55,838
a hundred of them in the world gotcha so

945
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:57,680
they're just the ones that are doing it

946
00:38:55,838 --> 00:38:59,279
can throw out so much that they're

947
00:38:57,679 --> 00:39:01,960
making a significant impact like

948
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:05,480
strawberry industry vitro vitro plus

949
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:07,159
vitro plus uh in Poland they produce 80%

950
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:10,318
of all the ornamental ferns the entire

951
00:39:07,159 --> 00:39:12,719
planet from a single lab

952
00:39:10,318 --> 00:39:14,719
Ian quick question there's a bunch of

953
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:16,318
people who are watching and if there's

954
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:18,879
only a hundred of these people in the

955
00:39:16,318 --> 00:39:20,800
world what would they if somebody were

956
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:23,000
watching and wanted to learn how to do

957
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,400
this propagation and learn this science

958
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,358
what would you recommend that they take

959
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,960
in

960
00:39:25,358 --> 00:39:31,199
college um I

961
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:34,838
recommend that they go to Cha University

962
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:36,679
in Japan and study with Dr Kai who is

963
00:39:34,838 --> 00:39:38,199
the father of tissue culture and they

964
00:39:36,679 --> 00:39:40,159
have the most advanced tissue culture

965
00:39:38,199 --> 00:39:43,639
program in the world there um that's

966
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:46,679
where doctors zide studied and uh uh so

967
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:49,598
you know it's um you know it's great

968
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:51,559
question like like to get into the field

969
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:54,200
um you got to get into these Labs you

970
00:39:51,559 --> 00:39:55,960
know it's like I see a lot of people

971
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:57,799
passing around this like plant and test

972
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:59,400
tubes book like you're not going to

973
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:01,920
learn how to do mass production through

974
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:04,800
that book you know like the uh the the

975
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:08,760
real what really kind of qualifies these

976
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:11,000
professionals is experience at scale um

977
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:12,599
and you know the ability to like I kind

978
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,159
of started out talking about that somac

979
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:16,599
clonal thing it's like managing all of

980
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:19,199
the stuff it it's farming you know like

981
00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:22,720
you you get good at it over years and

982
00:40:19,199 --> 00:40:24,279
Decades of experience and uh you know

983
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:25,959
that's kind of the most profound part to

984
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:27,880
me of this whole business is like it's

985
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:31,000
this crazy intersection of like

986
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:32,760
manufacturing and plants you know where

987
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,880
we really are getting about as close as

988
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:38,079
you can get to like a manufacturing

989
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:40,800
process still working with a with a

990
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:43,200
plant are the schools in Japan you're

991
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:45,640
talking about do they teach in Japanese

992
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:48,439
or English do you have to learn Japanese

993
00:40:45,639 --> 00:40:50,118
first no no you don't they teach the the

994
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:51,639
science is taught in English yeah

995
00:40:50,119 --> 00:40:55,680
doctors zide went there is a English

996
00:40:51,639 --> 00:40:59,480
teacher or English uh student so no you

997
00:40:55,679 --> 00:41:01,519
don't so in this micro propop concept um

998
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:02,800
in my my mind I hear I've heard tissue

999
00:41:01,519 --> 00:41:04,199
culture and I think that you know you

1000
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,079
can hand over your genetics to a

1001
00:41:04,199 --> 00:41:07,318
scientist they can chop it up they put

1002
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:09,440
it in the solution and then it's in a

1003
00:41:07,318 --> 00:41:11,119
refrigerator and then I can pull it out

1004
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:13,358
of that refrigerator whenever I want or

1005
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:15,400
they can and they can grow it out is

1006
00:41:13,358 --> 00:41:18,559
that the same with the microor or is it

1007
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:18,559
more like micro you're

1008
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:22,759
just yeah yeah there's there's two

1009
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:24,838
different um kind of approaches on the

1010
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:26,839
storage side is we're doing it right now

1011
00:41:24,838 --> 00:41:29,799
like at SRA we've got germ plasm

1012
00:41:26,838 --> 00:41:32,119
collection now for 10 of the big LPS in

1013
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:34,519
Canada and we're like backing up their

1014
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:37,000
stuff and you know in some cases doing

1015
00:41:34,519 --> 00:41:41,199
micropropagation right um but all of

1016
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:45,280
that storage um in our method right um

1017
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:48,598
we're storing all the plants um still as

1018
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:50,519
uh as nodes as live nodes in the jars um

1019
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:53,720
but what we do is we put them in a

1020
00:41:50,519 --> 00:41:55,519
special media um that makes them grow

1021
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:57,239
really really slow right or it just

1022
00:41:55,519 --> 00:41:59,280
doesn't you know so they you know

1023
00:41:57,239 --> 00:42:01,279
typically in TC we have to move all of

1024
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:03,960
our plantlets into a fresh jar with

1025
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:06,119
fresh media every four weeks right and

1026
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:07,240
if you don't they die right because

1027
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:09,760
they're you know all the nutrients

1028
00:42:07,239 --> 00:42:11,199
they're taking up are in the agar right

1029
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:13,280
their their whole carbon source is in

1030
00:42:11,199 --> 00:42:14,838
the agar their the light isn't even the

1031
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,440
light is basically just tricking them to

1032
00:42:14,838 --> 00:42:19,318
kind of Stay Alive like they're growing

1033
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:22,079
off of the the sugar from the agar

1034
00:42:19,318 --> 00:42:24,279
rather than photosynthesis right so you

1035
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:25,359
know we can store plants by slowing them

1036
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,880
down where then now we don't have to

1037
00:42:25,358 --> 00:42:29,598
transfer every month we can transfer

1038
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:31,480
every three months right and and in that

1039
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:33,240
kind of storage you can call it up

1040
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:35,519
really fast right like let's say you

1041
00:42:33,239 --> 00:42:37,318
decide oh I want that plant you know

1042
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:39,199
then the other option is

1043
00:42:37,318 --> 00:42:40,880
cryopreservation right and in

1044
00:42:39,199 --> 00:42:43,318
cryopreservation we can actually put

1045
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:45,480
that stuff away in the freezer um but if

1046
00:42:43,318 --> 00:42:47,639
you say you want and and and there you

1047
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:50,000
know without touching it it can last

1048
00:42:47,639 --> 00:42:51,558
essentially indefinitely right um but if

1049
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,159
you say you want to call something up

1050
00:42:51,559 --> 00:42:55,800
from prior preservation right you know

1051
00:42:54,159 --> 00:42:58,519
for us right now you know that's still

1052
00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:00,280
an experiment and uh you know we think

1053
00:42:58,519 --> 00:43:02,838
that timeline is probably somewhere

1054
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:04,480
between 6 and 12 months to be able to

1055
00:43:02,838 --> 00:43:07,558
bring something out and actually start

1056
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:08,400
working with it again so Ian before we

1057
00:43:07,559 --> 00:43:11,240
get

1058
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:14,119
to taking something out or even putting

1059
00:43:11,239 --> 00:43:16,838
something in for storage can you explain

1060
00:43:14,119 --> 00:43:19,000
now as you explained the you know how 80

1061
00:43:16,838 --> 00:43:21,480
to 90% of problems with plants are

1062
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:24,920
actually these viruses or fungi or

1063
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:27,280
intracellular bacterias can you explain

1064
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:29,680
the importance of tissue culture in the

1065
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,680
sense of

1066
00:43:30,318 --> 00:43:36,159
initiation yeah so so you know TC right

1067
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:37,440
tissue culture and micropropagation

1068
00:43:36,159 --> 00:43:39,639
right more specifically here it's a

1069
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:41,480
four-step process right so You' got you

1070
00:43:39,639 --> 00:43:42,679
know initiation it's the same four steps

1071
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:44,679
whether you're doing blueberries or

1072
00:43:42,679 --> 00:43:46,118
cannabis right you know initiation is

1073
00:43:44,679 --> 00:43:48,679
the process where you're going to remove

1074
00:43:46,119 --> 00:43:50,400
all the contamination uh and then you

1075
00:43:48,679 --> 00:43:53,118
move into multiplication where you're G

1076
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54,680
to you know grow them multiply them

1077
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:56,640
third stage is rooting where you put the

1078
00:43:54,679 --> 00:43:58,318
roots on the plantlets um and then the

1079
00:43:56,639 --> 00:44:00,400
fourth stage acclamation where you're

1080
00:43:58,318 --> 00:44:01,920
going to you know just like with clones

1081
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:04,440
right slowly reduce the humidity and

1082
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:07,480
bring them out into the real world um so

1083
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:09,079
you know the initiation process is is

1084
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:10,440
really quite fascinating and I think

1085
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:12,880
that's where a lot of people are really

1086
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:14,358
struggling where you know they think

1087
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:16,079
that they've made it through the process

1088
00:44:14,358 --> 00:44:18,159
and they think that they've got a clean

1089
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:19,920
culture and they start trying to move

1090
00:44:18,159 --> 00:44:21,318
into the next phase and multiplication

1091
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:23,639
and they really don't right there's

1092
00:44:21,318 --> 00:44:25,400
still some intercellular bacteria in

1093
00:44:23,639 --> 00:44:27,480
there there's still things or virus that

1094
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:31,358
are that are slowing that process down

1095
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:35,079
so you know initiation for us um we've

1096
00:44:31,358 --> 00:44:36,440
done now uh over 150 Cult of ours and

1097
00:44:35,079 --> 00:44:37,880
we've been successful at all of them we

1098
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:39,960
haven't had one we haven't been able to

1099
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:42,000
get through the process yet um but they

1100
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:45,280
range you know some of them are going as

1101
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:49,239
fast as um five months through that

1102
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:53,319
process some are taking 12 or 14 months

1103
00:44:49,239 --> 00:44:53,318
and it really depends on how dirty that

1104
00:44:53,559 --> 00:44:58,839
stuff when it comes into us right so you

1105
00:44:56,679 --> 00:45:00,279
know these serial clones um that have

1106
00:44:58,838 --> 00:45:02,239
come in yeah some of them have taken a

1107
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:03,359
year to get through that process other

1108
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:05,399
times when we're working right from a

1109
00:45:03,358 --> 00:45:06,920
seed you know that can go super fast why

1110
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:08,838
because the seed isn't chalk full of all

1111
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:11,480
this you know contamination yet we can

1112
00:45:08,838 --> 00:45:13,000
move a lot faster with it so you know

1113
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:16,119
you'll hear a lot of people talking

1114
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:18,519
about you know doing this process in in

1115
00:45:16,119 --> 00:45:20,880
a you know two three four months and

1116
00:45:18,519 --> 00:45:23,039
that's just really not realistic um you

1117
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:24,800
know you really like when we make a

1118
00:45:23,039 --> 00:45:27,558
promise to a client you know we say it's

1119
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:30,240
going to take 9 to 12 months and um

1120
00:45:27,559 --> 00:45:32,839
we've done about 80% of the cultivars in

1121
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:34,959
like six or seven months um and really

1122
00:45:32,838 --> 00:45:36,719
it's just these outliers that you know

1123
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,838
do take that extra time and you know

1124
00:45:36,719 --> 00:45:40,879
basically what we're doing right is

1125
00:45:37,838 --> 00:45:42,119
we're isolating the meristem you know so

1126
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:44,440
you know in the plant you know the

1127
00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:46,358
meristems essentially separated from the

1128
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:48,400
vascular system of the plant it's

1129
00:45:46,358 --> 00:45:51,078
floating right and there's kind of a gel

1130
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:52,480
layer that separates it from the plant

1131
00:45:51,079 --> 00:45:54,680
and that's how these plants have evolved

1132
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:57,519
to protect themselves from viruses so

1133
00:45:54,679 --> 00:45:59,639
that growing tip is essentially growing

1134
00:45:57,519 --> 00:46:02,639
faster than the viruses can move in and

1135
00:45:59,639 --> 00:46:04,719
infect it so you isolate that little

1136
00:46:02,639 --> 00:46:05,799
tiny marem you know it's microscopic

1137
00:46:04,719 --> 00:46:07,239
right and then you're going to grow that

1138
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:10,440
out and then we're going to go through

1139
00:46:07,239 --> 00:46:12,799
that process again and potentially again

1140
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:14,318
if we have to and uh you know so that's

1141
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,920
where you know if it's clean enough we

1142
00:46:14,318 --> 00:46:18,358
can kind of catch it on that first turn

1143
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:20,800
but usually it's going to take more than

1144
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:22,679
uh more than one cycle to get through

1145
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:25,039
there thing the other thing you're going

1146
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:29,199
to need of course in and I'm sure you

1147
00:46:25,039 --> 00:46:33,159
guys got it already is uh test to

1148
00:46:29,199 --> 00:46:36,838
confirm the fungi was there and gone now

1149
00:46:33,159 --> 00:46:40,279
test to confirm a bacteria is there and

1150
00:46:36,838 --> 00:46:43,719
then gone and test to confirm viruses

1151
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:45,480
were there and gone and few people know

1152
00:46:43,719 --> 00:46:49,000
how to do that

1153
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:51,039
properly yeah good question so you know

1154
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,480
we've got a lab our lab our molecular

1155
00:46:51,039 --> 00:46:55,639
biology lab in Richmond you know we've

1156
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:59,599
developed uh molecular based assays now

1157
00:46:55,639 --> 00:47:01,199
for was like pther RIS octonia

1158
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:03,559
sclerotinia

1159
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:06,639
Bettis uh there's a couple more on there

1160
00:47:03,559 --> 00:47:10,119
that we we have um and then the uh you

1161
00:47:06,639 --> 00:47:12,960
know the virus testing right now is uh

1162
00:47:10,119 --> 00:47:16,318
really a disaster like in our in our

1163
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:18,960
opinion we haven't seen a lab yet um

1164
00:47:16,318 --> 00:47:21,279
that we consider to be validated uh

1165
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:23,559
doing a virus test on cannabis like ANL

1166
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:26,160
in Canada they're ripping tons of these

1167
00:47:23,559 --> 00:47:28,960
tests they're issuing uh what we're

1168
00:47:26,159 --> 00:47:30,759
assuming are false false positives left

1169
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:32,199
and right you know virus testing like

1170
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:34,079
we're learning with Corona virus it's

1171
00:47:32,199 --> 00:47:36,239
like it's the hardest analytical testing

1172
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:39,240
in the world right like viruses are

1173
00:47:36,239 --> 00:47:42,479
constantly changing and mutating and are

1174
00:47:39,239 --> 00:47:46,358
extremely difficult to fingerprint and

1175
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:50,519
identify um and and so you know the uh

1176
00:47:46,358 --> 00:47:53,039
the let me get it didn't beyond that Ian

1177
00:47:50,519 --> 00:47:56,318
the truth of it is is most of these

1178
00:47:53,039 --> 00:47:58,920
companies don't know how many viruses

1179
00:47:56,318 --> 00:48:01,159
have been at identified in Cana in

1180
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:04,240
cannabis whether they have symptoms or

1181
00:48:01,159 --> 00:48:08,000
not is a separation right but identifi

1182
00:48:04,239 --> 00:48:10,598
27 yeah now are you seeing things with

1183
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,480
the older clones like fusarium and and

1184
00:48:10,599 --> 00:48:17,200
things that have been passed on from

1185
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:19,358
from just backyard to tent grower to

1186
00:48:17,199 --> 00:48:22,239
indoor grower and back again be honest

1187
00:48:19,358 --> 00:48:24,799
we were not testing for fungus and

1188
00:48:22,239 --> 00:48:27,279
bacteria we were looking at viruses that

1189
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:30,920
was our Focus yeah

1190
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:32,760
y y yeah I think the uh the key here is

1191
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:34,960
like if you look at how these other

1192
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:38,520
Industries manage this risk like

1193
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:41,318
strawberries right um you know in the

1194
00:48:38,519 --> 00:48:43,159
strawberry business like they know that

1195
00:48:41,318 --> 00:48:46,759
you know the use of meristematic tissue

1196
00:48:43,159 --> 00:48:46,759
culture removes uh

1197
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:52,119
99.999% of any of these risks viruses

1198
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:54,079
bacteria Etc and uh you know yeah

1199
00:48:52,119 --> 00:48:55,318
they're like studying the viruses of

1200
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:57,359
course you know there's millions of

1201
00:48:55,318 --> 00:48:59,838
dollars that goes into that however

1202
00:48:57,358 --> 00:49:02,639
you know really from the production side

1203
00:48:59,838 --> 00:49:05,838
um you know they're like the dris and

1204
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:09,000
stuff you know they're not wasting their

1205
00:49:05,838 --> 00:49:11,000
time right because they know that the

1206
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,639
technique removes all that stuff and

1207
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:15,159
yeah on a very rare occasion something

1208
00:49:12,639 --> 00:49:16,798
slips through it um so I mean you know

1209
00:49:15,159 --> 00:49:19,558
of course they're trying to understand

1210
00:49:16,798 --> 00:49:21,559
these things but you know the key

1211
00:49:19,559 --> 00:49:23,480
backbone of all this is that when you

1212
00:49:21,559 --> 00:49:25,599
look across all of these other crops

1213
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:27,519
that have gone through this process you

1214
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:29,760
know that's the statistical reality is

1215
00:49:27,519 --> 00:49:32,318
if you do the process correctly um

1216
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:35,119
you're going to remove everything right

1217
00:49:32,318 --> 00:49:37,000
so you know it might be another 20 years

1218
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:38,838
before we really understand all of these

1219
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:41,679
viruses that are in cannabis and

1220
00:49:38,838 --> 00:49:43,239
absolutely they're there and you know

1221
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:45,399
the majority of them may well be

1222
00:49:43,239 --> 00:49:47,279
completely benign and we're in really

1223
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:50,079
really early days to be able to

1224
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:52,480
understand that and I would use huge

1225
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:55,200
caution in trusting the data coming from

1226
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:57,960
any lab on these virus assays like you

1227
00:49:55,199 --> 00:50:00,798
know our uh you know our chief science

1228
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:04,159
officer is a PhD virologist 30 years he

1229
00:50:00,798 --> 00:50:07,519
taught epidemiology at UBC and uh you

1230
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:09,318
know his take on this is basically like

1231
00:50:07,519 --> 00:50:12,039
you know for us even at SRA it's going

1232
00:50:09,318 --> 00:50:14,599
to take us probably another two years to

1233
00:50:12,039 --> 00:50:16,519
have our first virus assays out you know

1234
00:50:14,599 --> 00:50:18,838
really trying to do it the right way and

1235
00:50:16,519 --> 00:50:21,119
we're talking like you know millions of

1236
00:50:18,838 --> 00:50:24,798
dollars of of research money that's

1237
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:28,680
being designated to get to that goal so

1238
00:50:24,798 --> 00:50:30,280
you know it's uh it's it's a very um uh

1239
00:50:28,679 --> 00:50:33,159
tricky issue right now because we really

1240
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:35,680
don't have the analytical tools and and

1241
00:50:33,159 --> 00:50:38,239
uh you know several of these labs are

1242
00:50:35,679 --> 00:50:39,519
appear to really be kind of running wild

1243
00:50:38,239 --> 00:50:42,000
with this testing I mean like in

1244
00:50:39,519 --> 00:50:44,679
California now the whole um hop late and

1245
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:47,960
virro deal here you know there's several

1246
00:50:44,679 --> 00:50:49,519
Labs offering it and um you know we've

1247
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:51,440
been doing our due diligence like

1248
00:50:49,519 --> 00:50:52,679
interviewing these Labs trying to see if

1249
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:54,480
we can find a partner anywhere in the

1250
00:50:52,679 --> 00:50:56,318
world to do this testing and we haven't

1251
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:59,519
found anybody yet that we feel like has

1252
00:50:56,318 --> 00:51:01,880
really uh has a validated process for

1253
00:50:59,519 --> 00:51:03,639
looking at them so um but I think the

1254
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:05,920
key for all of us in the near term is

1255
00:51:03,639 --> 00:51:07,759
like we do know like from looking at

1256
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:10,480
these other crops we have a technology

1257
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:13,160
that statistically should remove all of

1258
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:15,400
those things um but no we don't have you

1259
00:51:13,159 --> 00:51:17,118
know the ability to do all of that

1260
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:19,318
testing like you know when things leave

1261
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:20,720
our door we go through our list of six

1262
00:51:19,318 --> 00:51:22,838
you know we've got these six uh

1263
00:51:20,719 --> 00:51:23,719
pathogens we can test for now and then

1264
00:51:22,838 --> 00:51:25,838
obviously you know we're doing

1265
00:51:23,719 --> 00:51:28,639
microscopy and you know everything that

1266
00:51:25,838 --> 00:51:32,480
we can um but yeah it's really early

1267
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:35,000
days um still in uh have incredible you

1268
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:38,000
know virus detection at scale for for

1269
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:41,000
this business it may be the early days

1270
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:45,000
but at the same time it is the future if

1271
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:47,280
you look at uh uh wine Growers so when

1272
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:49,838
they plant a new field of grape

1273
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:53,040
varieties you better believe they're all

1274
00:51:49,838 --> 00:51:57,119
certified virus free because they don't

1275
00:51:53,039 --> 00:51:58,798
use anything else it is the future yeah

1276
00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:01,039
and who you know who's developing most

1277
00:51:58,798 --> 00:52:03,798
of those cultivars right it's University

1278
00:52:01,039 --> 00:52:05,920
Systems you know and and they've got you

1279
00:52:03,798 --> 00:52:08,559
know yeah like UC Davis you know they

1280
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:10,920
got hundreds of millions of dollars that

1281
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:13,599
goes into you know developing these

1282
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:15,880
lines and developing the processes and

1283
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:18,559
you know so you know I think as as you

1284
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:20,880
start seeing like you know the big uh

1285
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:22,920
you know a institutional universities in

1286
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:24,880
the country in the world start to

1287
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:26,639
descend on this you know we're going to

1288
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:29,160
get answers a lot faster but you know

1289
00:52:26,639 --> 00:52:31,318
right now relying on you know like small

1290
00:52:29,159 --> 00:52:33,759
companies like CRA and you know private

1291
00:52:31,318 --> 00:52:35,480
small labs to like figure this out like

1292
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:38,760
you know none of us have the budgets to

1293
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:41,519
be able to really um to really do it you

1294
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:44,000
know did you say there did you say

1295
00:52:41,519 --> 00:52:48,960
there's only 27 viruses that have been

1296
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,960
isolated at this time well so I

1297
00:52:49,798 --> 00:52:54,039
I what did you say David I don't I don't

1298
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:57,160
have a I don't have a number on that I

1299
00:52:54,039 --> 00:53:01,880
think you threw a number out there

1300
00:52:57,159 --> 00:53:06,279
uh i' I've found 27 viruses that have

1301
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:09,119
been identified in cannabis uh more than

1302
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:11,240
half of them do not have any symptoms

1303
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:14,640
but there's some controversy whether or

1304
00:53:11,239 --> 00:53:18,399
not if you have 10 of those non-symptom

1305
00:53:14,639 --> 00:53:22,078
viruses then collectively they may start

1306
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:24,559
to show uh symptoms and are these listed

1307
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:26,960
in the hemp viruses and diseases book or

1308
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:29,880
are these unclassified at this

1309
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:35,119
no maybe maybe half of them are there

1310
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:37,318
the other ones uh I've collected uh and

1311
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:40,519
uh been in contact with viral

1312
00:53:37,318 --> 00:53:44,480
researchers and AD them one by one by

1313
00:53:40,519 --> 00:53:47,798
one by one until now the total is

1314
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:52,760
27 so I have a question you I've seen a

1315
00:53:47,798 --> 00:53:55,239
good bit at scale in terms of viral um

1316
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:57,280
decline in a in a plant's health and and

1317
00:53:55,239 --> 00:54:00,199
specifically when it when it goes from

1318
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:03,319
Veg into flower you you see the you see

1319
00:54:00,199 --> 00:54:05,480
the transformation happen um I've

1320
00:54:03,318 --> 00:54:08,000
documented with with photos and and I've

1321
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:11,639
done this over the past few years and my

1322
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:13,119
question is is is from you know a couple

1323
00:54:11,639 --> 00:54:14,960
of these things I've kept just to just

1324
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:17,680
in hopes that I could bring them into a

1325
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:19,358
tissue culture environment and kind of

1326
00:54:17,679 --> 00:54:21,719
clean them and bring them back to quote

1327
00:54:19,358 --> 00:54:24,318
unquote life and I guess the real

1328
00:54:21,719 --> 00:54:25,759
question is is you know that hope and

1329
00:54:24,318 --> 00:54:28,759
that dream to bring that specific

1330
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:30,640
variety back Is that real in terms of

1331
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:34,480
what you were talking about when you

1332
00:54:30,639 --> 00:54:37,400
bring it in to clean it are you going to

1333
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:40,159
come out with genetic drift and how real

1334
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:42,039
is that um and what does that look like

1335
00:54:40,159 --> 00:54:44,558
for someone like myself that wants to

1336
00:54:42,039 --> 00:54:46,199
save things and kind of preserve and and

1337
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:47,760
keep things it's not that everything is

1338
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:49,279
has been like that it's just there's two

1339
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:51,559
or three varieties that I've noticed

1340
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:55,839
that just don't perform the same way and

1341
00:54:51,559 --> 00:54:55,839
you can clearly see it through photos

1342
00:54:58,199 --> 00:55:01,318
yeah you just got to get them into the

1343
00:54:59,679 --> 00:55:02,719
into the tissue culture process right I

1344
00:55:01,318 --> 00:55:04,480
mean it's like we can't you know we

1345
00:55:02,719 --> 00:55:06,759
can't answer those questions yet of

1346
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:09,519
exactly what's uh you know what's there

1347
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:11,240
or what's not right and uh um but it's

1348
00:55:09,519 --> 00:55:14,159
really kind of unimportant it's like

1349
00:55:11,239 --> 00:55:15,798
remove the stuff and you know let's see

1350
00:55:14,159 --> 00:55:18,598
what happens with the plant I mean some

1351
00:55:15,798 --> 00:55:20,358
of these plants like uh you know we did

1352
00:55:18,599 --> 00:55:22,480
uh over the last year and a half we've

1353
00:55:20,358 --> 00:55:24,199
done trials with four of the big LPS

1354
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:26,480
where we built the TC lab in their

1355
00:55:24,199 --> 00:55:28,598
facility we grew their strains we

1356
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:31,719
flowered the Clones next to the TC

1357
00:55:28,599 --> 00:55:33,960
plants like 18 months later right right

1358
00:55:31,719 --> 00:55:36,118
and uh I mean in some of those examples

1359
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:37,880
some of those examples the plants came

1360
00:55:36,119 --> 00:55:40,519
out and they don't even look like the

1361
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:43,400
same strain like there was one that was

1362
00:55:40,519 --> 00:55:46,920
like a was like a um you know narrow

1363
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:48,680
Leaf indicia uh you know seven years ago

1364
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:51,720
and the plants that we initiated looked

1365
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:53,798
like a long leaf sativa and after we

1366
00:55:51,719 --> 00:55:55,798
removed whatever we did I don't know

1367
00:55:53,798 --> 00:55:57,480
what we removed plants look totally

1368
00:55:55,798 --> 00:55:59,960
different they looked and the grower was

1369
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:01,358
like holy [ __ ] like he showed me a

1370
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:03,679
picture he's like dude look at this

1371
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:06,318
plant from you know six years ago that's

1372
00:56:03,679 --> 00:56:09,639
what it looked like right interesting

1373
00:56:06,318 --> 00:56:12,358
you know so it's the the effect of all

1374
00:56:09,639 --> 00:56:14,279
of this on the plane you know is is Far

1375
00:56:12,358 --> 00:56:16,719
and Beyond you know potentially just

1376
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:18,720
like slowing it down or you know you

1377
00:56:16,719 --> 00:56:20,399
know having little little differences

1378
00:56:18,719 --> 00:56:22,159
you know it can be it can be drastic now

1379
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:24,599
that's an extreme example I'm giving you

1380
00:56:22,159 --> 00:56:27,000
you know most of the plants you know

1381
00:56:24,599 --> 00:56:28,640
what I see are extreme examples like I I

1382
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,639
could I should send you some photos I

1383
00:56:28,639 --> 00:56:33,960
mean they're extreme you see the even

1384
00:56:30,639 --> 00:56:35,679
the inter internal lanks are just it's

1385
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:37,679
insane I mean you you're you're looking

1386
00:56:35,679 --> 00:56:38,759
at very different completely different

1387
00:56:37,679 --> 00:56:41,239
plants

1388
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:44,599
almost so

1389
00:56:41,239 --> 00:56:45,719
y um well cool that's that's that's

1390
00:56:44,599 --> 00:56:46,720
really good

1391
00:56:45,719 --> 00:56:47,879
information

1392
00:56:46,719 --> 00:56:51,159
[Music]

1393
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:53,559
um so are we at the point where you

1394
00:56:51,159 --> 00:56:57,038
think we can replace mother rooms and

1395
00:56:53,559 --> 00:56:59,440
and put them into uh

1396
00:56:57,039 --> 00:57:03,799
you know with a with the trained

1397
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:05,159
operator to really run uh your varieties

1398
00:57:03,798 --> 00:57:08,559
over and over like you're saying with

1399
00:57:05,159 --> 00:57:10,318
micro propagation or or are we still in

1400
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:13,160
that in between stage where we're still

1401
00:57:10,318 --> 00:57:16,920
learning um what the best path forward

1402
00:57:13,159 --> 00:57:18,639
is yeah I think uh you know I think

1403
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:21,000
we're we're still kind of in the middle

1404
00:57:18,639 --> 00:57:22,798
of that right now you know like at at S

1405
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:25,358
I mean we're doing it you know we're

1406
00:57:22,798 --> 00:57:27,119
we're now producing plants at scale we

1407
00:57:25,358 --> 00:57:31,038
shipped out orders this year up to

1408
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:34,599
40,000 in a single order um you know so

1409
00:57:31,039 --> 00:57:37,440
it's happening um the um you know the

1410
00:57:34,599 --> 00:57:39,960
real challenge well a couple things you

1411
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:42,000
know is um cultivars you know they don't

1412
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:44,720
all perform the same in tissue culture

1413
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,440
there's some uh that you know really

1414
00:57:44,719 --> 00:57:48,558
seem to slip right in there and be very

1415
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:51,280
happy and there's others that aren't

1416
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:53,640
right they don't multiply as easily um

1417
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:55,839
you know and so you know like I said you

1418
00:57:53,639 --> 00:57:57,798
know we've got about 250 cultivars that

1419
00:57:55,838 --> 00:58:00,199
we've put through the process you know

1420
00:57:57,798 --> 00:58:02,759
and out of that there's about 30 now you

1421
00:58:00,199 --> 00:58:04,439
know that we feel really confident you

1422
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:06,799
know in our ability to consistently

1423
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:09,079
produce them and and the acclamation you

1424
00:58:06,798 --> 00:58:10,199
know to know how to bring them out right

1425
00:58:09,079 --> 00:58:11,400
because you'll see you'll see a lot of

1426
00:58:10,199 --> 00:58:14,759
these plants they come out looking like

1427
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:17,318
Chia Pets or you know kind of crazy you

1428
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:19,880
know and uh you know that's that's again

1429
00:58:17,318 --> 00:58:22,119
the whole Talent of like how do you make

1430
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:24,519
that transition really smooth you know

1431
00:58:22,119 --> 00:58:25,798
as you're coming out of the process and

1432
00:58:24,519 --> 00:58:29,440
and you know that's something that takes

1433
00:58:25,798 --> 00:58:32,559
years years of of uh of Trials and and

1434
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:34,280
so you know there's really kind of a

1435
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:36,000
like at this point in the in the

1436
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:37,839
evolution of tissue culture for cannabis

1437
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:40,079
at least for us you know it's really

1438
00:58:37,838 --> 00:58:42,239
kind of a phenotyping process that we go

1439
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:44,599
through again right with the plant where

1440
00:58:42,239 --> 00:58:46,279
it's like you give me your thing that's

1441
00:58:44,599 --> 00:58:48,640
got everything you like and you know I

1442
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:51,319
put it in TC and you know it's going to

1443
00:58:48,639 --> 00:58:53,038
take us some time to figure out how to

1444
00:58:51,318 --> 00:58:54,558
work with it in that environment you

1445
00:58:53,039 --> 00:58:56,319
know and we've got some Cult of ours

1446
00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:58,760
that we're just like that one's going on

1447
00:58:56,318 --> 00:59:00,480
the Shelf like we're you know we could

1448
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:02,319
maybe spend a bunch of time and energy

1449
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:03,880
working with it and figuring it out but

1450
00:59:02,318 --> 00:59:05,880
it's you know at this point in the game

1451
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:09,358
we can't you know we're trying to just

1452
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:11,519
focus on going with what we have um so

1453
00:59:09,358 --> 00:59:14,679
the uh you know I think the the

1454
00:59:11,519 --> 00:59:17,440
integration into like production the

1455
00:59:14,679 --> 00:59:20,358
thing that's been really interesting is

1456
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:21,639
um that you know these TC plants you

1457
00:59:20,358 --> 00:59:24,159
know there's this term called like a

1458
00:59:21,639 --> 00:59:25,838
signal curve right so like when you look

1459
00:59:24,159 --> 00:59:27,598
at the growth of a of a cannabis plant

1460
00:59:25,838 --> 00:59:29,199
you you know it kind of exponentially

1461
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:31,640
starts growing faster and producing more

1462
00:59:29,199 --> 00:59:34,639
biomass as it as it gains momentum and

1463
00:59:31,639 --> 00:59:37,279
gains size um and uh you know what we've

1464
00:59:34,639 --> 00:59:39,719
noticed with the TC plants is you know

1465
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:41,519
for the first uh two to three weeks of

1466
00:59:39,719 --> 00:59:44,719
their life they grow they do grow way

1467
00:59:41,519 --> 00:59:46,920
slower than a clone word right so you

1468
00:59:44,719 --> 00:59:49,598
know essentially if you're going to do

1469
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:52,440
this you really are adding about two

1470
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:56,880
weeks of time two to three weeks of time

1471
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:58,639
into the overall growth cycle of that PL

1472
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:59,798
right so that sounds like a bad thing

1473
00:59:58,639 --> 01:00:01,400
right it's like wait a minute I got to

1474
00:59:59,798 --> 01:00:02,920
grow that plant for another three weeks

1475
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:05,680
right that's time and money and

1476
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:07,119
resources Etc you know however you know

1477
01:00:05,679 --> 01:00:09,759
what we're what we're tending to do now

1478
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:11,039
is you know our product is um if you

1479
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:13,359
look on our website you know we call

1480
01:00:11,039 --> 01:00:16,480
them a micr plug where they're tiny you

1481
01:00:13,358 --> 01:00:18,078
know they're um they're uh instead of a

1482
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:20,719
a 50 cell tray of clones you know

1483
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:22,480
there's 200 in that same spacing right

1484
01:00:20,719 --> 01:00:23,719
um and you know most of our clients are

1485
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:26,679
taking those and then they're putting

1486
01:00:23,719 --> 01:00:29,078
them into a 50 cell tray right and

1487
01:00:26,679 --> 01:00:31,358
putting them on a rack for two weeks so

1488
01:00:29,079 --> 01:00:33,480
like yeah it's taking an extra two weeks

1489
01:00:31,358 --> 01:00:35,838
but it's at on a vertical rack using

1490
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:37,880
almost no square footage and very little

1491
01:00:35,838 --> 01:00:39,318
lighting you know so yeah you know

1492
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:41,440
little energy what you get in the

1493
01:00:39,318 --> 01:00:44,000
tradeoff is you get a plant that's

1494
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:47,039
consistent and clean right but yeah it

1495
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:49,079
does have that extra workflow um so you

1496
01:00:47,039 --> 01:00:51,559
know there's a lot of complaints around

1497
01:00:49,079 --> 01:00:54,160
oh that you know the TC plants grow you

1498
01:00:51,559 --> 01:00:55,599
know too slowly they take too long and

1499
01:00:54,159 --> 01:00:57,199
yeah they do take a little longer and

1500
01:00:55,599 --> 01:00:58,960
like let's say you're doing a you know

1501
01:00:57,199 --> 01:01:02,719
an ultra highdensity indoor where you

1502
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:05,000
only veg for two weeks right right yeah

1503
01:01:02,719 --> 01:01:06,919
that's like you know uh that's a

1504
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:08,960
challenge because you know it's it's

1505
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:11,000
going to take longer you know our little

1506
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:14,720
plants grow so slowly in that in that

1507
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:16,358
first phase so you know that's uh you

1508
01:01:14,719 --> 01:01:17,798
know one of the challenges like you know

1509
01:01:16,358 --> 01:01:19,960
the two real big challenges that we're

1510
01:01:17,798 --> 01:01:21,838
trying to manage are you know getting

1511
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:24,039
that consistent growth coming out of

1512
01:01:21,838 --> 01:01:26,639
acclamation and then you know keeping

1513
01:01:24,039 --> 01:01:29,200
our eyes on this whole mutation

1514
01:01:26,639 --> 01:01:32,598
risk essentially Ian there was a

1515
01:01:29,199 --> 01:01:36,798
question in the chat it was about

1516
01:01:32,599 --> 01:01:39,599
viruses and they said are the viruses

1517
01:01:36,798 --> 01:01:44,559
airborne and as far as I know they're

1518
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:48,240
spread by tools by people and by insects

1519
01:01:44,559 --> 01:01:50,599
with direct contact yep the only place I

1520
01:01:48,239 --> 01:01:53,959
think there could be an Airborne risk is

1521
01:01:50,599 --> 01:01:57,200
um is uh in uh you know post Harvest

1522
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:58,720
processing like if you're grinding up uh

1523
01:01:57,199 --> 01:02:00,399
you know lots of fresh Mater you know if

1524
01:01:58,719 --> 01:02:02,118
you're literally grinding material and

1525
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:04,039
putting it in the air yeah you could

1526
01:02:02,119 --> 01:02:06,318
have you know but it's particles flying

1527
01:02:04,039 --> 01:02:08,240
around in the air it's not like you know

1528
01:02:06,318 --> 01:02:10,480
necessarily just you know like like us

1529
01:02:08,239 --> 01:02:12,278
with co co of like breathing bacteria

1530
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:14,559
you know it's not going to just breathe

1531
01:02:12,278 --> 01:02:17,440
off the off the stomas of the plants

1532
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:19,640
right so yeah tools you know and I mean

1533
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:21,720
like you see uh you know down here in

1534
01:02:19,639 --> 01:02:23,239
California like guys that I know down

1535
01:02:21,719 --> 01:02:25,480
here that are getting more sophisticated

1536
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:27,879
yeah they've got systems now where like

1537
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:31,318
every employee is sanitizing all of

1538
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:33,519
their tools between plants um you know

1539
01:02:31,318 --> 01:02:35,960
and that's sanitization is an enormous

1540
01:02:33,519 --> 01:02:38,400
deal like cloning you know like if you

1541
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:40,559
are doing cloning like you should be

1542
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:43,079
doing it in like a laboratory type

1543
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:45,559
environment you know like you should be

1544
01:02:43,079 --> 01:02:47,359
doing everything you can you know like I

1545
01:02:45,559 --> 01:02:49,000
mean I'm guilty over the years you know

1546
01:02:47,358 --> 01:02:50,639
it's like you just start getting used to

1547
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:53,000
it and you know 's an old cutting board

1548
01:02:50,639 --> 01:02:55,318
and some razor blade or whatever you

1549
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:56,599
know like the use of you know peroxide

1550
01:02:55,318 --> 01:03:00,199
and uh

1551
01:02:56,599 --> 01:03:02,000
and uh uh what's the stuff in cleanse is

1552
01:03:00,199 --> 01:03:03,919
it calcium hypoc what do they call it

1553
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:06,798
stuff hypoc chlorate um there's this

1554
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:08,760
other substance hyp chlorus acid yeah

1555
01:03:06,798 --> 01:03:12,159
hypoc chloris acid you know you should

1556
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:13,880
be using these tools you know to to make

1557
01:03:12,159 --> 01:03:15,798
the absolute cleanest plant that you

1558
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:17,838
possibly can like you know just going

1559
01:03:15,798 --> 01:03:20,079
into the grow room with your dirty hands

1560
01:03:17,838 --> 01:03:22,599
and your dirty scissors and and your

1561
01:03:20,079 --> 01:03:24,798
tray and chopping away like you know

1562
01:03:22,599 --> 01:03:27,599
you're asking for trouble so you know

1563
01:03:24,798 --> 01:03:30,798
definitely cleaning up that workflow can

1564
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:33,278
make you know enormous uh you know

1565
01:03:30,798 --> 01:03:36,759
differences in your ability to manage

1566
01:03:33,278 --> 01:03:38,599
manage the problem um you know but the

1567
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:40,440
uh you know the real solution will be a

1568
01:03:38,599 --> 01:03:42,278
concert of these things right it's like

1569
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:44,880
moving to a real clean stock kind of

1570
01:03:42,278 --> 01:03:47,920
starting material like TC you know and

1571
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:50,200
then also you know amping up the the

1572
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:53,358
hygiene you know like like when you go

1573
01:03:50,199 --> 01:03:55,879
in the big uh tomato green houses you

1574
01:03:53,358 --> 01:03:57,038
know those guys have uh in a couple of

1575
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:58,798
them I've seen these things like I

1576
01:03:57,039 --> 01:04:00,559
haven't seen the product yet in can in

1577
01:03:58,798 --> 01:04:02,599
in productize they make them themselves

1578
01:04:00,559 --> 01:04:04,000
where like when they squeeze their Tri

1579
01:04:02,599 --> 01:04:06,160
their scissors on the

1580
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,880
plants it like shoots out a little bit

1581
01:04:06,159 --> 01:04:09,679
of this sanitizing liquid right onto the

1582
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:11,440
blade of the scissors you know and

1583
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:13,879
they've got a little like pouch of their

1584
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:15,358
of their uh you know little sanitizer

1585
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:17,880
stuff that they're actually like using

1586
01:04:15,358 --> 01:04:19,318
out in the garden I've seen that in a

1587
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:20,798
couple of these big million square foot

1588
01:04:19,318 --> 01:04:22,798
green houses and like they both made

1589
01:04:20,798 --> 01:04:24,798
them themselves I'm curious if anybody's

1590
01:04:22,798 --> 01:04:27,239
ever seen a product like that like I've

1591
01:04:24,798 --> 01:04:31,000
searched around for one and I may find

1592
01:04:27,239 --> 01:04:35,479
one but uh but yeah you the closest I've

1593
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:38,480
seen in is uh where people use a tool

1594
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:42,079
for one plant whether it's one chop or

1595
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:46,278
100 chops on that plant and then they

1596
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:49,559
put the tool in a jar of a disinfectant

1597
01:04:46,278 --> 01:04:51,440
of some sort and uh use a different tool

1598
01:04:49,559 --> 01:04:54,599
and leave them soaking in there a half

1599
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:56,960
an hour or so then they can reuse them

1600
01:04:54,599 --> 01:04:58,798
yeah it sounds like fun

1601
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:00,838
right it's like you're on the greenhouse

1602
01:04:58,798 --> 01:05:03,119
with 100,000 plants trying to use clean

1603
01:05:00,838 --> 01:05:05,400
tools on every plant so you know but

1604
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:08,200
it's it it will definitely make you know

1605
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:11,039
all the sanit sanitization efforts like

1606
01:05:08,199 --> 01:05:13,480
really do really do it also it depends

1607
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:16,599
how big your plants are my mother plants

1608
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:19,519
used to be 15 feet tall I could easily

1609
01:05:16,599 --> 01:05:24,559
get thousands of clones from one mother

1610
01:05:19,519 --> 01:05:27,318
then change a tool yeah yeah so most of

1611
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:29,519
these viruses and bacteria come through

1612
01:05:27,318 --> 01:05:32,038
the cut part of a plant they're not

1613
01:05:29,519 --> 01:05:33,798
being uh transferred between each plant

1614
01:05:32,039 --> 01:05:35,480
as they touch each other they basically

1615
01:05:33,798 --> 01:05:37,079
get stored in the plant because of how

1616
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:39,960
it's

1617
01:05:37,079 --> 01:05:42,240
propagated well you're you know the cut

1618
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:43,760
is um you know just creating an open

1619
01:05:42,239 --> 01:05:45,679
wound site I mean you know you think

1620
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:47,240
about in a greenhouse or a Grove like

1621
01:05:45,679 --> 01:05:49,358
the amount of bacteria flying around in

1622
01:05:47,239 --> 01:05:52,038
the air in there you know of thousands

1623
01:05:49,358 --> 01:05:54,078
and thousands of species so yeah it's

1624
01:05:52,039 --> 01:05:55,680
really that you know that cutting

1625
01:05:54,079 --> 01:05:57,640
process so you know like again when

1626
01:05:55,679 --> 01:05:59,759
you're making your moms you know using

1627
01:05:57,639 --> 01:06:01,558
sanitized tools you know if you're

1628
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:04,319
making really big cuts on a plant you

1629
01:06:01,559 --> 01:06:06,839
know using something uh you know any of

1630
01:06:04,318 --> 01:06:09,558
these tree tree wound type substances

1631
01:06:06,838 --> 01:06:10,599
you know to to cover up that big wound

1632
01:06:09,559 --> 01:06:12,760
you know it's like you wouldn't walk

1633
01:06:10,599 --> 01:06:14,880
around with a huge cut on your arm like

1634
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:18,480
you're going to put something over it to

1635
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:21,119
to keep things clean you know um and uh

1636
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:23,559
and you know I uh like anecdotally you

1637
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:25,240
know these these risks really from what

1638
01:06:23,559 --> 01:06:26,599
I've seen so far seem to be much higher

1639
01:06:25,239 --> 01:06:28,639
with people over running soil based

1640
01:06:26,599 --> 01:06:31,440
systems unfortunately you know I mean

1641
01:06:28,639 --> 01:06:33,920
I'm a big Organics guy myself but gosh

1642
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:36,960
you know when you got soil in that room

1643
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:39,559
and you know all the biology that comes

1644
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:41,798
in with that you know is uh is just

1645
01:06:39,559 --> 01:06:44,278
another you know another another

1646
01:06:41,798 --> 01:06:46,199
variable right you know however you know

1647
01:06:44,278 --> 01:06:48,798
a lot of those organisms may be really

1648
01:06:46,199 --> 01:06:51,078
good at keeping your plant clean too you

1649
01:06:48,798 --> 01:06:54,559
know all the good guys so it's it's a

1650
01:06:51,079 --> 01:06:56,680
it's a game of roulette right so

1651
01:06:54,559 --> 01:07:01,160
beneficial versus is non beneficial

1652
01:06:56,679 --> 01:07:01,159
right who wins yep

1653
01:07:02,159 --> 01:07:06,399
exactly

1654
01:07:03,838 --> 01:07:08,239
awesome I think the real key with it is

1655
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:11,039
that we want to you know support

1656
01:07:08,239 --> 01:07:14,078
ecosystems that promote beneficial

1657
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:16,079
organisms you know the the the

1658
01:07:14,079 --> 01:07:19,079
microbacteria within the soil that are

1659
01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:21,798
going to feed the plants but while at

1660
01:07:19,079 --> 01:07:24,839
the same time creating a sterile you

1661
01:07:21,798 --> 01:07:26,519
know propagation line that that way that

1662
01:07:24,838 --> 01:07:28,199
you know each time time we propagate

1663
01:07:26,519 --> 01:07:31,038
that uh

1664
01:07:28,199 --> 01:07:33,038
clone it comes out more sterile than the

1665
01:07:31,039 --> 01:07:34,960
than the previous time and then you know

1666
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:38,000
it's just a matter of as as you see

1667
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:40,199
those bad you know whether bad insects

1668
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:42,920
or bad microbes show up there's there's

1669
01:07:40,199 --> 01:07:44,480
generally a a bigger insect or microb

1670
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:46,880
that'll eat

1671
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:50,199
them um you just have to you know

1672
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:51,559
there's for example lactobacillus eating

1673
01:07:50,199 --> 01:07:55,838
uh mil some of the

1674
01:07:51,559 --> 01:07:57,599
Milos but the you know I with the rules

1675
01:07:55,838 --> 01:08:00,119
and regulations around cannabis you have

1676
01:07:57,599 --> 01:08:02,440
to you know start from as clean of a

1677
01:08:00,119 --> 01:08:04,318
cutting as possible just to minimize

1678
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:07,599
that contamination when you're re

1679
01:08:04,318 --> 01:08:11,119
restarting rooms or or green

1680
01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:15,239
houses Ian I want to say one thing and

1681
01:08:11,119 --> 01:08:18,520
that was that uh many viruses can be

1682
01:08:15,239 --> 01:08:20,119
transmitted by both seeds and

1683
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:23,520
pollen

1684
01:08:20,119 --> 01:08:26,439
absolutely so I don't know about

1685
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:29,880
bacteria and uh

1686
01:08:26,439 --> 01:08:32,000
guy but uh viruses I would say the

1687
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:35,159
majority of them can be

1688
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:38,198
transported uh in SE

1689
01:08:35,158 --> 01:08:39,879
and that's a that's a a key comment

1690
01:08:38,198 --> 01:08:45,238
right there I mean it's like if you look

1691
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:46,640
at um crops like pasas right you know um

1692
01:08:45,238 --> 01:08:49,479
you know they are produced through

1693
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:51,838
tissue culture um they're also you know

1694
01:08:49,479 --> 01:08:53,959
they're a prolific seed producing plant

1695
01:08:51,838 --> 01:08:56,238
right it's like and why they're still

1696
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:58,279
done through TC is because the virus

1697
01:08:56,238 --> 01:09:00,358
issues where you know they carry right

1698
01:08:58,279 --> 01:09:04,080
through the seed and uh you know you

1699
01:09:00,359 --> 01:09:07,279
wouldn't have today like a global viable

1700
01:09:04,079 --> 01:09:11,559
um you know papaya industry without the

1701
01:09:07,279 --> 01:09:14,159
ability to control and and manage the uh

1702
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:16,199
the virus right um hold on just one sec

1703
01:09:14,158 --> 01:09:19,879
guys be right

1704
01:09:16,198 --> 01:09:21,439
back I was just going to say on the um

1705
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:23,319
the reason I was so quick to pop on on

1706
01:09:21,439 --> 01:09:25,759
the hypochlorous acid is because I I

1707
01:09:23,319 --> 01:09:27,920
bought this machine about a year ago

1708
01:09:25,759 --> 01:09:32,479
that makes hypochlorous acid water for

1709
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:34,798
me um it's kind of a weird deal and um

1710
01:09:32,479 --> 01:09:36,519
it's expensive the the brand that I

1711
01:09:34,798 --> 01:09:38,000
bought it's not really for Farm use but

1712
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:39,719
I think there's there's some models out

1713
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:42,319
there that are for Farm use and they

1714
01:09:39,719 --> 01:09:45,759
basically electroly and use salt water

1715
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:50,279
to make a a sterile low PH

1716
01:09:45,759 --> 01:09:52,798
2.5 elect electrolyzed water and um I

1717
01:09:50,279 --> 01:09:56,480
got it as as it was sold as an IPM deal

1718
01:09:52,798 --> 01:09:58,960
like I could spray the low ph

1719
01:09:56,479 --> 01:10:02,158
to kill insects and then spray the

1720
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:03,880
extremely high pH to kill pathogens um

1721
01:10:02,158 --> 01:10:05,519
and it's it's been all right we working

1722
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:07,119
for me you know to be honest I haven't

1723
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:09,480
used it as much for that but what I have

1724
01:10:07,119 --> 01:10:12,279
used it for and it's really up my game

1725
01:10:09,479 --> 01:10:14,039
and in in taking my cuts and and all my

1726
01:10:12,279 --> 01:10:16,639
tools because I just push this [ __ ]

1727
01:10:14,039 --> 01:10:18,560
button and out comes this W it's it's

1728
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:21,199
sterile but it's not bleach it does not

1729
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:22,920
toxic like I don't mind being being on

1730
01:10:21,198 --> 01:10:24,198
me or spilling or whatever using

1731
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:25,600
excessive amounts because I have this

1732
01:10:24,198 --> 01:10:27,759
machine I just push the but button and

1733
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:29,079
out it comes and so I use it all over

1734
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:31,920
the place and it's really stepped my

1735
01:10:29,079 --> 01:10:33,479
game up in in my sterility you know

1736
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:35,079
because I am an organic guy and there's

1737
01:10:33,479 --> 01:10:37,799
a lot of lot of stuff floating around

1738
01:10:35,079 --> 01:10:40,158
and then the other comment on that is

1739
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:42,199
just like being being smart you know yes

1740
01:10:40,158 --> 01:10:43,719
things compost yes there's a bigger guy

1741
01:10:42,198 --> 01:10:45,759
to eat something but you know there's a

1742
01:10:43,719 --> 01:10:47,439
time and a place for that and I I I

1743
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:50,159
leave the composting for the compost

1744
01:10:47,439 --> 01:10:52,359
pile and try to keep you know things

1745
01:10:50,158 --> 01:10:53,879
pretty as clean as I can given the fact

1746
01:10:52,359 --> 01:10:55,079
that I have a really you know tons of

1747
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:57,440
plants growing in there that are not

1748
01:10:55,079 --> 01:11:01,960
just cannabis there all sorts of

1749
01:10:57,439 --> 01:11:03,479
[ __ ] but my what for what about another

1750
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:05,760
uh thing I wanted to talk about in

1751
01:11:03,479 --> 01:11:08,079
regards to you know what you guys are

1752
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:11,039
doing with tissue culture is is the lab

1753
01:11:08,079 --> 01:11:14,679
work and the potential future of being

1754
01:11:11,039 --> 01:11:16,640
able to use I guess genetic

1755
01:11:14,679 --> 01:11:19,440
identification like being able to see

1756
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:21,280
the gene synthesis find them in a way I

1757
01:11:19,439 --> 01:11:22,919
know we're not quite there yet but C can

1758
01:11:21,279 --> 01:11:24,559
you talk a little bit about that if you

1759
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:26,679
have any idea what I'm actually talking

1760
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:28,159
about

1761
01:11:26,679 --> 01:11:29,760
uh I mean anything about the breeding

1762
01:11:28,158 --> 01:11:33,519
side

1763
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:35,119
yeah yeah so I mean it's yeah like at

1764
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:36,600
you know at SRA like I mentioned we've

1765
01:11:35,119 --> 01:11:39,279
got two different businesses really

1766
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:41,880
there's the tissue culture operation led

1767
01:11:39,279 --> 01:11:43,759
by this guy Dr zide and then we have a

1768
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:46,079
separate facility that's really run like

1769
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:48,480
a different business um that's our

1770
01:11:46,079 --> 01:11:50,960
molecular biology lab run by this guy Dr

1771
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:52,718
John brunstein and uh you know they're

1772
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:55,239
very intentionally in two different

1773
01:11:52,719 --> 01:11:57,239
places um you know like at the

1774
01:11:55,238 --> 01:12:01,079
genotyping lab we've got permits there

1775
01:11:57,238 --> 01:12:04,039
to um possess and uh do testing with all

1776
01:12:01,079 --> 01:12:05,359
these controlled pathogens uh so like

1777
01:12:04,039 --> 01:12:08,880
obviously we want that to be in a

1778
01:12:05,359 --> 01:12:10,839
different place so um so you know in

1779
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:13,319
that in that division of the of the

1780
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:15,800
company you know we are working on

1781
01:12:13,319 --> 01:12:18,198
developing um a bunch of different

1782
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:20,440
genomics tools that should lead us

1783
01:12:18,198 --> 01:12:22,000
towards the ability to start doing um

1784
01:12:20,439 --> 01:12:25,519
marker assisted

1785
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:27,479
breeding um and uh you know there's for

1786
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:29,400
us there's a there's a couple things I'd

1787
01:12:27,479 --> 01:12:31,279
mention here where you know the first

1788
01:12:29,399 --> 01:12:37,158
genotyping test we developed is called

1789
01:12:31,279 --> 01:12:39,158
this v&amp; test um and b&amp; is what's used in

1790
01:12:37,158 --> 01:12:41,879
essentially every forensics lab in the

1791
01:12:39,158 --> 01:12:43,839
world right and b&amp; has been established

1792
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:47,000
to do to be able to tell like is the

1793
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:48,760
blood on the table your blood and uh you

1794
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:52,039
know if so you're going to prison for

1795
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:53,840
life right so um and it's you know used

1796
01:12:52,039 --> 01:12:55,399
in all of these forensics labs around

1797
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:57,360
the world so they have you know a

1798
01:12:55,399 --> 01:12:59,319
standardized test to be able to do this

1799
01:12:57,359 --> 01:13:00,920
fingerprinting and everybody uses the

1800
01:12:59,319 --> 01:13:04,198
same thing right wouldn't that be nice

1801
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:06,199
in cannabis so you know so we developed

1802
01:13:04,198 --> 01:13:09,158
that test where like if you give me a

1803
01:13:06,198 --> 01:13:12,519
plant sample right two you give me two

1804
01:13:09,158 --> 01:13:14,839
leaves I can test the two of them and I

1805
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:16,280
can tell you like a fingerprint if

1806
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:18,039
they're the same or not right if they

1807
01:13:16,279 --> 01:13:20,759
have the same fingerprint but I can't

1808
01:13:18,039 --> 01:13:22,880
tell any of the trait information I

1809
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:24,840
can't tell you know if that plant's

1810
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:28,199
going to be tall or short or high THC or

1811
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:31,319
low THC like you know that vntr looks at

1812
01:13:28,198 --> 01:13:33,238
12 markers uh which is like we found

1813
01:13:31,319 --> 01:13:35,519
statistically to be just enough for us

1814
01:13:33,238 --> 01:13:37,359
to be able to you know with an extremely

1815
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:40,320
high level of certainty guarantee two

1816
01:13:37,359 --> 01:13:42,559
things are the same or not right um but

1817
01:13:40,319 --> 01:13:44,960
like the key there is you know as we're

1818
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:48,120
collaborating with other organizations

1819
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:49,639
right you can give us your germ plasm

1820
01:13:48,119 --> 01:13:52,238
and you know that's the only kind of

1821
01:13:49,639 --> 01:13:53,719
genotype test we would do on that plant

1822
01:13:52,238 --> 01:13:56,238
right it's in our contract it says we'll

1823
01:13:53,719 --> 01:13:58,079
do a vntr and that's just so we can

1824
01:13:56,238 --> 01:14:00,718
guarantee that we're not mixing things

1825
01:13:58,079 --> 01:14:01,880
up and that when we ship it out we b&amp; it

1826
01:14:00,719 --> 01:14:04,800
make sure it's exactly what it's

1827
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:07,199
supposed to be um uh but then you know

1828
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:08,880
behind the scenes we're developing um

1829
01:14:07,198 --> 01:14:12,399
other genomics tests that are really

1830
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:15,400
going to be useful for plant breeding

1831
01:14:12,399 --> 01:14:17,519
and um you know the the whole kind of

1832
01:14:15,399 --> 01:14:20,439
genomics world of late has really been

1833
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:23,120
chasing this alumina testing like you'll

1834
01:14:20,439 --> 01:14:25,238
hear you know phus bioscience does you

1835
01:14:23,119 --> 01:14:27,158
know and that's like extremely high

1836
01:14:25,238 --> 01:14:29,599
resolution testing it's really really

1837
01:14:27,158 --> 01:14:31,679
expensive and uh we've been developing

1838
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:34,960
tools it's kind of like um like that's

1839
01:14:31,679 --> 01:14:40,319
like a digital recording you know versus

1840
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:42,359
um um uh you know the um I lost my train

1841
01:14:40,319 --> 01:14:44,158
of thought there yeah the the you know

1842
01:14:42,359 --> 01:14:46,359
the really high resolution testing like

1843
01:14:44,158 --> 01:14:48,960
um alumina is like looking at a digital

1844
01:14:46,359 --> 01:14:51,000
recording whereas like the v&amp; is kind of

1845
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:54,359
like a cassette tape right it's much

1846
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:56,399
lower resolution um and uh but it's way

1847
01:14:54,359 --> 01:14:58,198
cheaper right right we can run these v&amp;

1848
01:14:56,399 --> 01:14:59,920
tests for super cheap so you know we're

1849
01:14:58,198 --> 01:15:04,359
working on developing tests that are

1850
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:06,279
kind of between alumina and um vntr that

1851
01:15:04,359 --> 01:15:09,559
are like stepping stones to getting you

1852
01:15:06,279 --> 01:15:12,119
to those to to using the um the higher

1853
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:15,159
resolution test like a um like the

1854
01:15:12,119 --> 01:15:18,119
alumina alumina test so you know the

1855
01:15:15,158 --> 01:15:21,439
whole like World here of being able to

1856
01:15:18,119 --> 01:15:23,679
identify high value markers um and

1857
01:15:21,439 --> 01:15:25,638
utilize those markers actively in a

1858
01:15:23,679 --> 01:15:27,359
breeding program

1859
01:15:25,639 --> 01:15:29,960
um you know is still very much in its

1860
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:32,238
infancy like we figure we're probably

1861
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:34,880
about another you know two to three

1862
01:15:32,238 --> 01:15:37,359
years out from being able to apply these

1863
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:39,520
Technologies to actually utilizing

1864
01:15:37,359 --> 01:15:41,799
marker assisted breeding and you know

1865
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:44,920
I'm sure some of these big LPS are are

1866
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:47,119
making some moves there um but uh it's

1867
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:49,719
going to take quite a while to uh for

1868
01:15:47,119 --> 01:15:52,920
those like you say it's not it's not so

1869
01:15:49,719 --> 01:15:55,679
simple Ian because some markers for

1870
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:58,880
example for a particular canal anoid or

1871
01:15:55,679 --> 01:16:01,679
for a particular tpine that that you can

1872
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:04,279
see relatively easy but what you can't

1873
01:16:01,679 --> 01:16:07,399
see is how much is the plant going to

1874
01:16:04,279 --> 01:16:09,158
express under optimal conditions in

1875
01:16:07,399 --> 01:16:13,119
other words is it going to produce a

1876
01:16:09,158 --> 01:16:15,279
whole lot of CBC or practically none but

1877
01:16:13,119 --> 01:16:17,679
nobody's really got their hands around

1878
01:16:15,279 --> 01:16:20,920
that yet and here's another question if

1879
01:16:17,679 --> 01:16:25,359
they do see that synthes can they tell

1880
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:25,359
if it will be on or off

1881
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:30,279
not with certainty

1882
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:33,159
yet yeah it's it's you know I think all

1883
01:16:30,279 --> 01:16:35,000
of this is uh you know we're in uh we're

1884
01:16:33,158 --> 01:16:38,439
in h The Dugout here we're not even in

1885
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:40,319
the first inning you know with um the

1886
01:16:38,439 --> 01:16:43,439
application of you know molecular

1887
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:45,519
breeding tools for for cannabis and I

1888
01:16:43,439 --> 01:16:48,000
think it's you know like a big part of

1889
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:50,800
this is like you know really like the

1890
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:53,079
University Systems like once they start

1891
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:55,079
getting in and and sinking their budgets

1892
01:16:53,079 --> 01:16:58,119
into this stuff it's going to start

1893
01:16:55,079 --> 01:16:59,359
really really rolling a lot faster um

1894
01:16:58,119 --> 01:17:00,840
you know because like on the private

1895
01:16:59,359 --> 01:17:02,880
sector you know the companies that

1896
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:05,119
really have the tech you know they're

1897
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:07,760
not in cannabis yet you know they're not

1898
01:17:05,119 --> 01:17:09,439
they're not here so you know there's you

1899
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:11,440
know small companies like ours that are

1900
01:17:09,439 --> 01:17:14,599
you know chipping away at the bigger

1901
01:17:11,439 --> 01:17:16,279
picture but you know I think the uh you

1902
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:18,159
know the big boys will be coming in here

1903
01:17:16,279 --> 01:17:21,399
at some

1904
01:17:18,158 --> 01:17:24,079
point it they they know it from many

1905
01:17:21,399 --> 01:17:25,519
other commercial crops much better than

1906
01:17:24,079 --> 01:17:28,319
cannabis but

1907
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:32,400
they have scratch of surface you know

1908
01:17:28,319 --> 01:17:37,158
they can find syntheses and tpes and

1909
01:17:32,399 --> 01:17:40,238
other uh markers but uh the ones that

1910
01:17:37,158 --> 01:17:43,198
they really need for Vigor for

1911
01:17:40,238 --> 01:17:45,399
resistance those are the ones that uh

1912
01:17:43,198 --> 01:17:48,319
are going to really change the

1913
01:17:45,399 --> 01:17:52,439
industry yep you're

1914
01:17:48,319 --> 01:17:54,158
right so all right I um I apologize I'm

1915
01:17:52,439 --> 01:17:57,039
gonna have to jump off here fellas I got

1916
01:17:54,158 --> 01:17:59,079
to go something here at 10:30 um dude

1917
01:17:57,039 --> 01:18:01,039
thanks for throwing it down well it's a

1918
01:17:59,079 --> 01:18:04,479
good start we uh I mentioned you Marcus

1919
01:18:01,039 --> 01:18:08,800
we're doing this webinar on Thursday um

1920
01:18:04,479 --> 01:18:12,399
uh with Dr zabid is doing um the ABCs of

1921
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:14,840
PTC on Thursday afternoon and if any of

1922
01:18:12,399 --> 01:18:16,238
you guys want to learn more um that's

1923
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:18,319
going to be an awesome opportunity we'll

1924
01:18:16,238 --> 01:18:20,718
have an hour he's going to go through a

1925
01:18:18,319 --> 01:18:23,399
deck that like goes through you know all

1926
01:18:20,719 --> 01:18:25,239
the different Technologies and um and

1927
01:18:23,399 --> 01:18:26,759
then we're going to have a Q&amp;A and we're

1928
01:18:25,238 --> 01:18:28,519
going to try and start doing those like

1929
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:30,039
once a month or something like that

1930
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:31,960

01:19:52,479 --> 01:19:57,039
one well I felt like uh that was some

1964
01:19:55,479 --> 01:19:58,919
pretty good information nice little

1965
01:19:57,039 --> 01:20:00,760
conversation for about an hour there on

1966
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:02,679
tissue culture and hopefully I'll be

1967
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:05,119
able to get Ian back here one day

1968
01:20:02,679 --> 01:20:07,480
because he is a wealth of information

1969
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:10,359
when it comes to this

1970
01:20:07,479 --> 01:20:12,158
stuff that was fascinating I I love

1971
01:20:10,359 --> 01:20:12,549
asking questions when I can understand

1972
01:20:12,158 --> 01:20:15,648
what's

1973
01:20:12,550 --> 01:20:15,649
[Music]

1974
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:27,079
going let me tell you it is the future

1975
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:28,560
of cannabis breeding and mass production

1976
01:20:27,079 --> 01:20:30,679
that's the way they do strawberries

1977
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:32,719
that's the way they do grapes it's the

1978
01:20:30,679 --> 01:20:36,359
future well if we're going to have our

1979
01:20:32,719 --> 01:20:37,840
Costco ounces yeah no doubt it has to be

1980
01:20:36,359 --> 01:20:40,198
that way you know if it's going to be

1981
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:43,400
propagated nationally in a way that is

1982
01:20:40,198 --> 01:20:45,359
consistent so I can get my same OG kush

1983
01:20:43,399 --> 01:20:46,920
here is the same OG Kush on the East

1984
01:20:45,359 --> 01:20:49,119
Coast without any issues you know what

1985
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:50,960
I'm saying or congales or whatever

1986
01:20:49,119 --> 01:20:54,920
genetic that's still the issue and still

1987
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:57,760
the problem so every grower manufacturer

1988
01:20:54,920 --> 01:21:00,319
producers dealing with this problem of

1989
01:20:57,760 --> 01:21:02,520
how to propagate safely their genetics

1990
01:21:00,319 --> 01:21:04,000
and it's one I had problems with when I

1991
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:05,719
was working with Ed because we

1992
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:08,039
definitely Ed Rosenthal went because we

1993
01:21:05,719 --> 01:21:10,679
were definitely not in a sterilized room

1994
01:21:08,039 --> 01:21:13,238
and environment and we had you know

1995
01:21:10,679 --> 01:21:15,560
certain problems that just inadvertently

1996
01:21:13,238 --> 01:21:17,359
happen and to know that this type of

1997
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:20,039
research is out there that they're

1998
01:21:17,359 --> 01:21:22,799
calling and pulling out these viruses

1999
01:21:20,039 --> 01:21:25,198
and bacteria and that there's actually

2000
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:29,279
methodologies that are sound that can be

2001
01:21:25,198 --> 01:21:31,759
doing so I can't see why any type of

2002
01:21:29,279 --> 01:21:34,119
large company isn't looking for these

2003
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:35,960
type of propagator so people are

2004
01:21:34,119 --> 01:21:38,599
watching they gave you the university in

2005
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:41,119
Japan to go to and learn this this a lot

2006
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:44,039
of we need a lot of

2007
01:21:41,119 --> 01:21:47,880
you big growers in the future when they

2008
01:21:44,039 --> 01:21:51,359
have a choice will take the safe road

2009
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:53,159
you know the clean Road I love it as an

2010
01:21:51,359 --> 01:21:54,719
opportunity for small Growers I love

2011
01:21:53,158 --> 01:21:56,559
cannabis to get to a point where you

2012
01:21:54,719 --> 01:21:58,359
could just open up the computer and be

2013
01:21:56,560 --> 01:22:00,080
like I'm going to order up some of these

2014
01:21:58,359 --> 01:22:02,079
uh different cultivars that I hear them

2015
01:22:00,079 --> 01:22:04,800
talking about on hash church and and

2016
01:22:02,079 --> 01:22:06,639
then knowing with like it's it's amazing

2017
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:07,960
to me how many people in the chat were

2018
01:22:06,639 --> 01:22:09,880
kind of tripping they were like oh

2019
01:22:07,960 --> 01:22:12,239
they're hacking plants they're this is

2020
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:13,840
some scientific GMO [ __ ] I'm like no no

2021
01:22:12,238 --> 01:22:15,599
no he's literally telling you this is

2022
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:18,440
the opposite of that he's not doing that

2023
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:21,840
he's taking fingerprints and and marking

2024
01:22:18,439 --> 01:22:24,359
a plant so that if you order it he can

2025
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:26,119
give you a guarantee and out of a lab

2026
01:22:24,359 --> 01:22:28,039
that that's actually been validated

2027
01:22:26,119 --> 01:22:29,920
which is not a cheap thing to do it

2028
01:22:28,039 --> 01:22:33,960
takes a couple years and it's millions

2029
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:38,639
of dollars to validate a lab I know they

2030
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:41,158
did yeah to do with DMO it has nothing

2031
01:22:38,639 --> 01:22:43,079
to do it's actually cloning that's the

2032
01:22:41,158 --> 01:22:46,079
first thing Ian ever told me about Dr

2033
01:22:43,079 --> 01:22:48,880
schile he said he's as much a farmer as

2034
01:22:46,079 --> 01:22:52,760
he is a scientist and he has to be an

2035
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:55,560
equal of both for this world to exist

2036
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:58,159
this is not callous tissue culture this

2037
01:22:55,560 --> 01:23:02,560
is Meemic and to think that you could

2038
01:22:58,158 --> 01:23:05,679
order micr plugs of safe genetics holy

2039
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:07,800
my God right dude what a huge advantage

2040
01:23:05,679 --> 01:23:09,960
to give that's the true gift for a

2041
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:12,560
patient in my opinion like if patience

2042
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:14,399
could be ordering clean plants do you

2043
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:17,080
know what a listen let's all be honest

2044
01:23:14,399 --> 01:23:18,799
it's not as easy as people sometimes say

2045
01:23:17,079 --> 01:23:20,359
it is to grow cannabis it's a lot of

2046
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:22,239
attention it's like having a bloody

2047
01:23:20,359 --> 01:23:24,279
puppy dog you got to take care of this

2048
01:23:22,238 --> 01:23:26,599
thing or it's it's going to die like you

2049
01:23:24,279 --> 01:23:29,000
really have to take care of it and so to

2050
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:31,360
be able to order clean plantlets and

2051
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:33,679
have that sort of Advantage right from

2052
01:23:31,359 --> 01:23:37,639
the beginning rather than get like mited

2053
01:23:33,679 --> 01:23:40,199
aphed out pests ridden bacteria loaded

2054
01:23:37,639 --> 01:23:41,840
virus and fungi the whole nine yards and

2055
01:23:40,198 --> 01:23:44,479
then you're supposed to Crow something

2056
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:46,639
with that you're like oh I got like 26

2057
01:23:44,479 --> 01:23:49,359
grams it's like come on man they need

2058
01:23:46,639 --> 01:23:52,119
the advantage we all do it's also that

2059
01:23:49,359 --> 01:23:54,839
way with seeds Marcus you buy seeds in

2060
01:23:52,119 --> 01:23:58,198
the hope that they're going to give you

2061
01:23:54,840 --> 01:24:00,800
what the breeder has promised and that

2062
01:23:58,198 --> 01:24:04,638
may or may not be the case you may get

2063
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:08,400
one with 10 different phenotypes in each

2064
01:24:04,639 --> 01:24:11,400
seed batch and a virus in that

2065
01:24:08,399 --> 01:24:13,638
seed yeah who knows also yeah I didn't

2066
01:24:11,399 --> 01:24:17,238
even want to get into that or how many

2067
01:24:13,639 --> 01:24:20,279
of those 27 potentially are in that

2068
01:24:17,238 --> 01:24:22,638
seed oh that's what I'm saying I think

2069
01:24:20,279 --> 01:24:24,198
it's great for initiation I love it as a

2070
01:24:22,639 --> 01:24:26,159
service can you imagine if there was

2071
01:24:24,198 --> 01:24:28,599
just a facility one day where you can

2072
01:24:26,158 --> 01:24:31,638
just bring your dirty ass nasty infested

2073
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:34,719
[ __ ] plant pay a fee and in like 6

2074
01:24:31,639 --> 01:24:37,119
months just like return back and be like

2075
01:24:34,719 --> 01:24:39,079
have the chance to a put it into the

2076
01:24:37,119 --> 01:24:40,719
library you know especially if they

2077
01:24:39,079 --> 01:24:42,359
fingerprint it and it's nothing they've

2078
01:24:40,719 --> 01:24:44,480
ever seen it's not a part of anything

2079
01:24:42,359 --> 01:24:46,799
they connect it to you now you somehow

2080
01:24:44,479 --> 01:24:48,479
are making something off that plant and

2081
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:50,039
you you give it to them to to let the

2082
01:24:48,479 --> 01:24:51,959
rest of the world have access to it or

2083
01:24:50,039 --> 01:24:54,880
you give it to them only to hold just

2084
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:56,719
for you whatever your mentality is I

2085
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:59,039
just like the idea of being able to

2086
01:24:56,719 --> 01:25:01,279
clean the plants make them available to

2087
01:24:59,039 --> 01:25:03,000
people uh I certainly wouldn't like it

2088
01:25:01,279 --> 01:25:05,238
if it just got locked into like giant

2089
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:08,158
universities and it was like oh no no

2090
01:25:05,238 --> 01:25:10,439
random no regular people could access it

2091
01:25:08,158 --> 01:25:12,439
or you could only buy the product I mean

2092
01:25:10,439 --> 01:25:14,439
so be it that's still probably going to

2093
01:25:12,439 --> 01:25:17,198
happen but I like the idea of it being

2094
01:25:14,439 --> 01:25:19,799
available to everyone that to me is a

2095
01:25:17,198 --> 01:25:22,198
successful successful business model it

2096
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:26,279
would be nice if it was a little faster

2097
01:25:22,198 --> 01:25:28,039
like a car wash you know 24 hour

2098
01:25:26,279 --> 01:25:30,319
yeah that would that's uh that's the

2099
01:25:28,039 --> 01:25:33,639
super uer duper future you're you're

2100
01:25:30,319 --> 01:25:36,158
living in there or even the super duper

2101
01:25:33,639 --> 01:25:38,480
future of you could actually test that

2102
01:25:36,158 --> 01:25:40,799
seed to find out what viruses are

2103
01:25:38,479 --> 01:25:43,919
actually inside there you have to grow

2104
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:47,119
the plant out currently right uh Sam to

2105
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:50,520
actually you can test seed Embry it's no

2106
01:25:47,118 --> 01:25:53,799
problem you can do the seed okay

2107
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:56,760
yes course that destroys the seed then

2108
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:59,760
you know I have that sea right whereas

2109
01:25:56,760 --> 01:26:03,159
with a little plantlet you just need a a

2110
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:03,159
punch of of a

2111
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:10,760
leaf need the Home

2112
01:26:07,719 --> 01:26:12,719
unit need a home unit Johnny I need a

2113
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:15,400
home

2114
01:26:12,719 --> 01:26:17,000
unit I saw you going in your garden and

2115
01:26:15,399 --> 01:26:18,118
looking at your garden like yeah that

2116
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:21,319
ain't

2117
01:26:18,118 --> 01:26:24,960
sterile oh [ __ ] I'm just like I got like

2118
01:26:21,319 --> 01:26:27,039
I got plants everywhere I got like yeah

2119
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:28,439
I'm just yeah doing different feeding

2120
01:26:27,039 --> 01:26:30,519
different grow meeting seeing what's

2121
01:26:28,439 --> 01:26:33,638
taking what under what LEDs and what's

2122
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:35,440
feeding better and seeing what's yeah

2123
01:26:33,639 --> 01:26:36,359
I'm just having fun and having for

2124
01:26:35,439 --> 01:26:38,479
months

2125
01:26:36,359 --> 01:26:39,839
so yeah but there's nothing sterile here

2126
01:26:38,479 --> 01:26:42,198
at all zero right so I'm just kind of

2127
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:44,960
looking around go you know that's my own

2128
01:26:42,198 --> 01:26:49,359
research Johnny I've had a greenhouse

2129
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:51,079
for uh 30 years it was never sterile if

2130
01:26:49,359 --> 01:26:54,799
it would have the plants wouldn't have

2131
01:26:51,079 --> 01:26:54,800
grown as good

2132
01:26:56,158 --> 01:27:01,799
yeah it's

2133
01:26:58,600 --> 01:27:03,639
definitely a lot of fun looking at how

2134
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:05,840
he's doing I mean I did some of those

2135
01:27:03,639 --> 01:27:07,239
first grows with Segar I got the strains

2136
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:09,360
right here remember that Mark so I

2137
01:27:07,238 --> 01:27:10,839
remember that first tissue culture one

2138
01:27:09,359 --> 01:27:12,880
and just thinking about that I'm just

2139
01:27:10,840 --> 01:27:15,719
thinking how he's able to kind of keep

2140
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:17,679
those strains alive and at the same time

2141
01:27:15,719 --> 01:27:19,920
just like you say disease bug free

2142
01:27:17,679 --> 01:27:21,960
everything that comes to your freshia

2143
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:24,239
curious after like 15 years of having

2144
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:26,239
the strain I mean what what where the

2145
01:27:24,238 --> 01:27:28,198
problems lie where I have the tops of

2146
01:27:26,238 --> 01:27:30,079
buds just dying and just little things

2147
01:27:28,198 --> 01:27:31,678
with different I look at my plants and

2148
01:27:30,079 --> 01:27:35,600
kind of Wonder now

2149
01:27:31,679 --> 01:27:37,880
so I'm sure it uh it would be quite

2150
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:40,280
different if uh you got it all cleaned

2151
01:27:37,880 --> 01:27:40,279
up and

2152
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:44,880
initiated yeah I'd love a mechanic shop

2153
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:47,840
where I could take my plant in will you

2154
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:49,520
please pull this [ __ ] out okay boom yeah

2155
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:51,719
like you said earlier can you imagine

2156
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:53,440
that you know clean your genetics

2157
01:27:51,719 --> 01:27:56,480
somebody would make a killing off of

2158
01:27:53,439 --> 01:27:59,319
clean your genetics company I mean but

2159
01:27:56,479 --> 01:28:02,879
that would take decade to even just get

2160
01:27:59,319 --> 01:28:06,759
up not only clean your genetics but

2161
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:09,319
imagine taking a plant or a Seedling or

2162
01:28:06,760 --> 01:28:12,000
a leaf or whatever it is that they need

2163
01:28:09,319 --> 01:28:15,399
they examine the DNA and they say well

2164
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:19,000
this plant has the ability to produce uh

2165
01:28:15,399 --> 01:28:23,559
medium large amounts of DC medium large

2166
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:26,439
amounts of XYZ and they know not only

2167
01:28:23,560 --> 01:28:29,679
which compounds they have the ability to

2168
01:28:26,439 --> 01:28:33,359
produce but in what sort of ratios and

2169
01:28:29,679 --> 01:28:33,359
amounts that will be the

2170
01:28:37,439 --> 01:28:41,799
future yeah it'll be interesting to see

2171
01:28:39,719 --> 01:28:44,840
anyway I like the idea of clean genetics

2172
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:46,239
I feel a lot of Growers you know are

2173
01:28:44,840 --> 01:28:49,159
would

2174
01:28:46,238 --> 01:28:51,879
would probably instantaneously take the

2175
01:28:49,158 --> 01:28:54,198
credit but uh they're taking the you

2176
01:28:51,880 --> 01:28:56,118
know the grief when they're growing

2177
01:28:54,198 --> 01:28:58,599
these plants that are just unable to

2178
01:28:56,118 --> 01:29:01,118
express themselves even with fairly

2179
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:03,440
decent Growers you know you get plants

2180
01:29:01,118 --> 01:29:06,279
that are sick enough and it's uh once

2181
01:29:03,439 --> 01:29:10,799
they're sick do you not agree Sam that

2182
01:29:06,279 --> 01:29:12,840
they tend to um attack attract pests

2183
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:15,880
like it's like these little insects like

2184
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:20,480
just see that they're weak of course

2185
01:29:15,880 --> 01:29:22,960
because they uh their resistance is down

2186
01:29:20,479 --> 01:29:25,919
it's either dialed down or it just

2187
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:28,600
doesn't exist anymore those bugs see

2188
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:28,600
that in some

2189
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:35,198
way so

2190
01:29:31,439 --> 01:29:38,000
yeah everybody would prefer to have the

2191
01:29:35,198 --> 01:29:41,158
best not only the variety they want but

2192
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:44,198
expresses the smells and effects and

2193
01:29:41,158 --> 01:29:46,638
taste and can avoids they want but

2194
01:29:44,198 --> 01:29:49,799
they'd like the plant to be dependable

2195
01:29:46,639 --> 01:29:51,960
so it doesn't have health problems when

2196
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:56,039
you treated it in the normal way you

2197
01:29:51,960 --> 01:29:56,039
treat plants successfully

2198
01:29:56,479 --> 01:30:04,158
yeah true enough true

2199
01:30:00,319 --> 01:30:06,519
enough well that's uh it's a lot to uh

2200
01:30:04,158 --> 01:30:10,319
take in today Ian was uh going off on a

2201
01:30:06,520 --> 01:30:13,360
pretty high level of uh of tissue

2202
01:30:10,319 --> 01:30:15,319
culture my brain's mush man after that

2203
01:30:13,359 --> 01:30:20,559
I'm just like I

2204
01:30:15,319 --> 01:30:25,079
have right in my head going

2205
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:27,400
man oh me too I'm

2206
01:30:25,079 --> 01:30:27,399
you

2207
01:30:28,439 --> 01:30:35,039
what you love science you don't just

2208
01:30:31,679 --> 01:30:37,359
like science you passionately love

2209
01:30:35,039 --> 01:30:39,479
science in a way that porn producers

2210
01:30:37,359 --> 01:30:44,039
could never get the pictures

2211
01:30:39,479 --> 01:30:46,879
of uh absolutely true I science is

2212
01:30:44,039 --> 01:30:50,118
almost a religion to me but I'm not a

2213
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:50,118
particularly religious

2214
01:30:51,439 --> 01:30:57,319
person but your perpetuation of Sciences

2215
01:30:54,679 --> 01:31:00,079
help propagate generations of genetics

2216
01:30:57,319 --> 01:31:02,799
that we wouldn't have known or had

2217
01:31:00,079 --> 01:31:05,880
otherwise so thank you for your uh

2218
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:07,840
science nerdness and willingness to you

2219
01:31:05,880 --> 01:31:09,719
know go there because you know you've

2220
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:12,159
you you made your mistakes early on to

2221
01:31:09,719 --> 01:31:14,158
realize I mean I would assume that you

2222
01:31:12,158 --> 01:31:15,479
realize early on that science was your

2223
01:31:14,158 --> 01:31:18,638
friend and not your

2224
01:31:15,479 --> 01:31:21,879
enemy yeah I mean and I I can honestly

2225
01:31:18,639 --> 01:31:24,440
say that because most of my life I've

2226
01:31:21,880 --> 01:31:27,199
been doing research and development

2227
01:31:24,439 --> 01:31:30,879
that I often learn more from

2228
01:31:27,198 --> 01:31:36,158
mistakes than uh I mean I I definitely

2229
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:39,920
have made more mistakes than uh

2230
01:31:36,158 --> 01:31:42,920
successes but you learn a lot when you

2231
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:44,920
remember don't do this and

2232
01:31:42,920 --> 01:31:48,760
intellectually you may know it but when

2233
01:31:44,920 --> 01:31:51,480
you do do it then you don't do it

2234
01:31:48,760 --> 01:31:54,679
again that's the key don't do it again

2235
01:31:51,479 --> 01:31:54,678
when it's

2236
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:59,880
would they say Einstein made like over a

2237
01:31:57,639 --> 01:32:02,000
thousand mistakes before he invented the

2238
01:31:59,880 --> 01:32:03,960
light bulb or something or there's all

2239
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:05,880
these things if you don't make mistakes

2240
01:32:03,960 --> 01:32:07,560
you're not learning you're not moving

2241
01:32:05,880 --> 01:32:09,520
forward you're not growing forward you

2242
01:32:07,560 --> 01:32:11,840
gotta make

2243
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:13,920
mistar did you just say Einstein

2244
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:15,960
invented the light bulb no I said that

2245
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:17,600
wrong I'm high I'm completely that was

2246
01:32:15,960 --> 01:32:19,760
awesome that was like a Johnny B quote

2247
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:23,039
I'm going back and that's going to be

2248
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:26,039
that is going to be the I I was going to

2249
01:32:23,039 --> 01:32:28,760
use one of Ian's little audio bits for

01:33:50,679 --> 01:33:54,639
to chat for another half an hour I'm I'm

2285
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:56,679
down with making it a couple hours but I

2286
01:33:54,639 --> 01:33:58,639
did just plan for a really short hash

2287
01:33:56,679 --> 01:34:01,118
church this morning because it was such

2288
01:33:58,639 --> 01:34:03,239
last minute if you guys had things you

2289
01:34:01,118 --> 01:34:05,000
wanted to discuss I'm absolutely down

2290
01:34:03,238 --> 01:34:06,319
we've polarized the chat pretty good or

2291
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:08,118
maybe it was just one guy I had to

2292
01:34:06,319 --> 01:34:10,519
bounce from the chat because he was uh

2293
01:34:08,118 --> 01:34:12,920
seemingly upset uh about our

2294
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:14,520
conversation about tissue culture he he

2295
01:34:12,920 --> 01:34:16,679
suggested that we were going to be

2296
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:20,480
creating the technology and giving it to

2297
01:34:16,679 --> 01:34:22,440
the Sharks to rape us I feel that uh

2298
01:34:20,479 --> 01:34:24,519
some people are not puffing on very good

2299
01:34:22,439 --> 01:34:27,559
herbs these days and I know that people

2300
01:34:24,520 --> 01:34:30,880
are stressful and uh or stressed out due

2301
01:34:27,560 --> 01:34:33,039
to uh you know this whole weird mind

2302
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:36,159
control thing everyone's going through

2303
01:34:33,039 --> 01:34:40,560
it's like any other tool Marcus it can

2304
01:34:36,158 --> 01:34:42,960
be used for good or for evil let's be

2305
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:44,440
honest yeah of course I just try to keep

2306
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:46,118
it good I'm trying you know it's just

2307
01:34:44,439 --> 01:34:48,158

good day and enjoy each other's Vibes

2309
01:34:48,158 --> 01:34:52,559
and not not give audience to you know

2310
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:54,639
because we worked hard for for this

2311
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:57,679
audience and it's if when I see people

2312
01:34:54,639 --> 01:34:59,679
being negative in the chat I feel like

2313
01:34:57,679 --> 01:35:01,279
you know what there's just uh you got to

2314
01:34:59,679 --> 01:35:03,520

sterilizing my cloners as

2330
01:35:42,600 --> 01:35:47,840
we was on my list today which I have I

2331
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:51,199
have four you know big clone or water

2332
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:53,079
cloners and it was on my list today and

2333
01:35:51,198 --> 01:35:54,960
like there is a lazy part inside me

2334
01:35:53,079 --> 01:35:56,960
still you guys guys and there you know I

2335
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:58,800
had this voice of this this guy ringing

2336
01:35:56,960 --> 01:36:01,000
in my head he's like oh I just [ __ ]

2337
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:03,119
put a little bleach in there run him and

2338
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:04,679
and go again and I I actually work him

2339
01:36:03,118 --> 01:36:07,279
down and scrub them really hard and it

2340
01:36:04,679 --> 01:36:09,800
takes me almost all day to clean my four

2341
01:36:07,279 --> 01:36:11,719
cloners and uh so he said that I was

2342
01:36:09,800 --> 01:36:14,440
like damn it rord like do your thing

2343
01:36:11,719 --> 01:36:18,118
clean that [ __ ] up proper so I just

2344
01:36:14,439 --> 01:36:18,118
started that's awesome

2345
01:36:18,639 --> 01:36:23,159
dude yeah sorry I'm just torching a bowl

2346
01:36:21,238 --> 01:36:24,638
and probably nobody wants to hear the uh

2347
01:36:23,158 --> 01:36:27,000
torch

2348
01:36:24,639 --> 01:36:28,600
I'm WR no I love the conversation I'll

2349
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:32,800
I'll just hop in like I'm always

2350
01:36:28,600 --> 01:36:35,119
thinking from uh you know I long time

2351
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:37,360
ago realized the food system and

2352
01:36:35,118 --> 01:36:39,238
realized cannabis is going that way and

2353
01:36:37,359 --> 01:36:42,198
it's taken a lot longer than I thought

2354
01:36:39,238 --> 01:36:44,118
it would take but I'm okay with it like

2355
01:36:42,198 --> 01:36:46,359
I'm okay with the folks that want to

2356
01:36:44,118 --> 01:36:47,920
[ __ ] us not not really that but I just

2357
01:36:46,359 --> 01:36:50,198
I'm okay that they exist and that's

2358
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:52,000
going to happen and it's a reality and

2359
01:36:50,198 --> 01:36:54,399
there there's going to be B big Mega

2360
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:56,118
cannabis and it's going to have a lot of

2361
01:36:54,399 --> 01:36:57,960
bad impacts but it's also going to have

2362
01:36:56,118 --> 01:37:00,158
a lot of good impacts it's going to have

2363
01:36:57,960 --> 01:37:03,760
accessibility there's this whole mixed

2364
01:37:00,158 --> 01:37:06,559
box but I look at like my place and our

2365
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:09,600
place in it and and it's always like we

2366
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:11,400
say the smaller thing and so you know

2367
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:14,719
yeah let let them tissue culture their

2368
01:37:11,399 --> 01:37:17,319
triploid you know [ __ ] sour dub that

2369
01:37:14,719 --> 01:37:19,439
comes in at like 67% you know total

2370
01:37:17,319 --> 01:37:21,399
cannaboids and blows everyone out of the

2371
01:37:19,439 --> 01:37:23,118
water that's going to be here in a

2372
01:37:21,399 --> 01:37:26,439
couple years and that's going to be in

2373
01:37:23,118 --> 01:37:29,000
production and what we have is something

2374
01:37:26,439 --> 01:37:31,759
a lot more unique that that cannot be

2375
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:33,639
produced you know with our our you know

2376
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:36,760
terara if you will you know whether it's

2377
01:37:33,639 --> 01:37:40,118
regional individual the way we cultivate

2378
01:37:36,760 --> 01:37:41,679
Etc you know just and then and then

2379
01:37:40,118 --> 01:37:44,158
thinking how does tissue culture play

2380
01:37:41,679 --> 01:37:45,679
into that into my like craft breeding

2381
01:37:44,158 --> 01:37:48,079
program because there's no way I'm going

2382
01:37:45,679 --> 01:37:50,279
to compete in my breeding with these

2383
01:37:48,079 --> 01:37:52,079
these Mega Cult of ours so I have to

2384
01:37:50,279 --> 01:37:54,279
focus on doing something that's unique

2385
01:37:52,079 --> 01:37:56,880
and and that's some might want to you

2386
01:37:54,279 --> 01:37:58,319
know smoke because they they care about

2387
01:37:56,880 --> 01:38:01,359
it a little bit more rather than buying

2388
01:37:58,319 --> 01:38:02,519
the Costco weed you know and yeah so

2389
01:38:01,359 --> 01:38:04,079
it's just really interesting thinking

2390
01:38:02,520 --> 01:38:07,040
like yeah maybe I need to figure this

2391
01:38:04,079 --> 01:38:09,760
out on on a small scale and set up a

2392
01:38:07,039 --> 01:38:11,760
small little sterile room so I can be

2393
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:13,599
running batches this way and breeding

2394
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:16,000
larger batches like I don't know it just

2395
01:38:13,599 --> 01:38:18,800
really I mean just having the ability to

2396
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:20,639
initiate your plants would be incredible

2397
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:21,639
if you just have a little closet area

2398
01:38:20,639 --> 01:38:23,118
where you're like I'm just going to

2399
01:38:21,639 --> 01:38:25,520
clean my plants and you clean them and

2400
01:38:23,118 --> 01:38:27,319
you plant them and start growing them I

2401
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:28,599
mean I saw some of the plants before you

2402
01:38:27,319 --> 01:38:29,840
breed with it like you're like hey I'm

2403
01:38:28,599 --> 01:38:31,760
going to I'm going to set off this room

2404
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:33,319
for laal and I've got everyone lined up

2405
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:35,159
what I'm going to do let's sterilize it

2406
01:38:33,319 --> 01:38:37,920
all and then breed with that clean and

2407
01:38:35,158 --> 01:38:40,118
you'll make the best seed

2408
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:42,199
right sorry I didn't mean to just run

2409
01:38:40,118 --> 01:38:44,799
over you

2410
01:38:42,198 --> 01:38:47,319
there oh no problem I'm also listen

2411
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:49,520
trying to talk to a dude in chat who's

2412
01:38:47,319 --> 01:38:52,158
asking me something about like

2413
01:38:49,520 --> 01:38:54,840
pgs he's like he can only get like three

2414
01:38:52,158 --> 01:38:58,279
and four star from p EGS I'm like well

2415
01:38:54,840 --> 01:38:59,880
no [ __ ] like so so your consideration

2416
01:38:58,279 --> 01:39:03,079
then is going towards something that's

2417
01:38:59,880 --> 01:39:05,159
more Artisan specific Artisan specific

2418
01:39:03,079 --> 01:39:06,479
genetics you know is that what you're

2419
01:39:05,158 --> 01:39:08,519
considering that's kind of what I was

2420
01:39:06,479 --> 01:39:10,158
saying yeah Artisan specific you know

2421
01:39:08,520 --> 01:39:12,520
unique the old stuff the stuff that

2422
01:39:10,158 --> 01:39:14,598
doesn't work on mass scale which is what

2423
01:39:12,520 --> 01:39:16,360
I was doing when I took a break and did

2424
01:39:14,599 --> 01:39:18,440
tomato farming I was growing these

2425
01:39:16,359 --> 01:39:20,839
heirlooms that no company can grow

2426
01:39:18,439 --> 01:39:22,678
because they can't ship and whatever so

2427
01:39:20,840 --> 01:39:25,079
if I grow them in regionally and support

2428
01:39:22,679 --> 01:39:26,599
just the local industry and I can drop

2429
01:39:25,079 --> 01:39:28,279
off my heirlooms on Friday that they're

2430
01:39:26,599 --> 01:39:30,039
going to cut up that afternoon and serve

2431
01:39:28,279 --> 01:39:32,238
Friday and Saturday night it worked and

2432
01:39:30,039 --> 01:39:35,439
I could get a high dollar so this is my

2433
01:39:32,238 --> 01:39:37,238
whole like you know I I I took a break

2434
01:39:35,439 --> 01:39:39,519
from Cannabis and learned all this by

2435
01:39:37,238 --> 01:39:42,158
reading organic agriculture books and

2436
01:39:39,520 --> 01:39:43,920
how to like you know do all the things

2437
01:39:42,158 --> 01:39:45,920
that we talk about take your product and

2438
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:48,399
and stack the benefits by maybe make it

2439
01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:51,000
into something else and and be just

2440
01:39:48,399 --> 01:39:52,559
being an outlier and and and not you

2441
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:54,319
know I don't know I just kind of gave in

2442
01:39:52,560 --> 01:39:56,520
like you guys won a long time ago you

2443
01:39:54,319 --> 01:39:57,639
won you got it you have big business

2444
01:39:56,520 --> 01:39:59,880
you're going to take

2445
01:39:57,639 --> 01:40:02,480
cannabis where I love cannabis where can

2446
01:39:59,880 --> 01:40:04,118
I fit in this you know that's I don't

2447
01:40:02,479 --> 01:40:06,638
think they realize how cannabis is going

2448
01:40:04,118 --> 01:40:08,399
to affect them you know where you that

2449
01:40:06,639 --> 01:40:10,400
is the other Factor you're right that's

2450
01:40:08,399 --> 01:40:12,279
what people people should have faith in

2451
01:40:10,399 --> 01:40:14,198
cannabis because uh you know there's a

2452
01:40:12,279 --> 01:40:17,439
reason why they kept it at Bay for so

2453
01:40:14,198 --> 01:40:20,279
long and kept the 9 foot steel door shut

2454
01:40:17,439 --> 01:40:23,000
on cannabis for so long because even

2455
01:40:20,279 --> 01:40:26,118
deep down they have to know how deep

2456
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:27,840
it's going to get into everyone's heads

2457
01:40:26,118 --> 01:40:29,319
whether they're wearing it or eating it

2458
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:31,719
for health or taking different

2459
01:40:29,319 --> 01:40:33,840
cannabinoids that are different from THC

2460
01:40:31,719 --> 01:40:36,880
or straight dabbing or recreational

2461
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:39,119
using or preventative using or you know

2462
01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:41,000
then the the Dozen new methods of using

2463
01:40:39,118 --> 01:40:43,679
that will pop up over the course of the

2464
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:46,399
next 10 or 20 years as the science gets

2465
01:40:43,679 --> 01:40:48,599
deeper and the cultivars get you know

2466
01:40:46,399 --> 01:40:50,000
you know bred and created that have

2467
01:40:48,599 --> 01:40:52,880
higher contents of different

2468
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:55,319
cannabinoids different ratios and I for

2469
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:57,639
one looking forward to uh where we're

2470
01:40:55,319 --> 01:41:00,000
going with cannabis well look what they

2471
01:40:57,639 --> 01:41:01,639
did with wine I mean wine you know they

2472
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,880
had bottles of wine and they realize

2473
01:41:01,639 --> 01:41:05,199
well just selling bottles of wine

2474
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:06,880
doesn't work so maybe if we create an

2475
01:41:05,198 --> 01:41:11,559
area where people could come and taste

2476
01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:14,279
the wine okay so I could see many

2477
01:41:11,560 --> 01:41:17,560
Cottage or Artisan cannabis doing

2478
01:41:14,279 --> 01:41:19,960
exactly that model creating a nice area

2479
01:41:17,560 --> 01:41:22,199
a beautiful experience when people come

2480
01:41:19,960 --> 01:41:24,920
in from when they drive up to when they

2481
01:41:22,198 --> 01:41:27,598
walk in come sample the Cannabis here's

2482
01:41:24,920 --> 01:41:29,639
our smoke room our ingestion room and

2483
01:41:27,599 --> 01:41:31,639
create that Vibe and that's the way

2484
01:41:29,639 --> 01:41:34,000
they'll sell their genetics just the

2485
01:41:31,639 --> 01:41:36,118
same way as there's certain venters here

2486
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:38,198
in California that only sell their wine

2487
01:41:36,118 --> 01:41:41,479
through a mailing list or through their

2488
01:41:38,198 --> 01:41:44,039
door like Visa tuille you'll never find

2489
01:41:41,479 --> 01:41:45,839
them on a store shelf but you'll go to

2490
01:41:44,039 --> 01:41:47,880
that Winery and pick up a couple of

2491
01:41:45,840 --> 01:41:50,119
cases because that shit's good and they

2492
01:41:47,880 --> 01:41:52,679
just produce enough just to sell that

2493
01:41:50,118 --> 01:41:55,839
way or through their mailing list so I

2494
01:41:52,679 --> 01:41:58,880
see that that model definitely becoming

2495
01:41:55,840 --> 01:42:00,880
Regional like in the Humbolt or mesino

2496
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:03,719
some of the the terroirs have now been

2497
01:42:00,880 --> 01:42:07,319
set here in California I can see that

2498
01:42:03,719 --> 01:42:09,760
type of you know communal but as well as

2499
01:42:07,319 --> 01:42:12,759
for the Artisan himself to show your

2500
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:15,239
wees such as you know here's you know

2501
01:42:12,760 --> 01:42:17,560
you could show a glass off you know wall

2502
01:42:15,238 --> 01:42:19,879
that shows the actual cannabis growing

2503
01:42:17,560 --> 01:42:22,159
etc etc so you know they could have the

2504
01:42:19,880 --> 01:42:24,719
experience of seeing it just like the

2505
01:42:22,158 --> 01:42:27,198
wines growing there at the you know at

2506
01:42:24,719 --> 01:42:30,359
the winery they get the whole experience

2507
01:42:27,198 --> 01:42:32,719
there in a regional situation you walk

2508
01:42:30,359 --> 01:42:35,960
in you you're buying outs you get a you

2509
01:42:32,719 --> 01:42:38,599
get a two grams of oil rosin you get 10

2510
01:42:35,960 --> 01:42:41,719
cuts and you go home and you get excited

2511
01:42:38,599 --> 01:42:43,920
for six months or down the road [ __ ]

2512
01:42:41,719 --> 01:42:45,920
I I hope you're right maybe you can call

2513
01:42:43,920 --> 01:42:48,319
the maybe you can call call me the

2514
01:42:45,920 --> 01:42:50,359
breeder and say hey what's going on with

2515
01:42:48,319 --> 01:42:52,079
me in July and I'm like oh hey you need

2516
01:42:50,359 --> 01:42:54,158
a compost tea I'll Brew you one up come

2517
01:42:52,079 --> 01:42:56,960
and pick it whatever like that is would

2518
01:42:54,158 --> 01:42:58,479
be the man I would I just cry just

2519
01:42:56,960 --> 01:43:02,118
dreaming of that you

2520
01:42:58,479 --> 01:43:05,118
know well I I I'm sure it's going to be

2521
01:43:02,118 --> 01:43:10,118
true not only that I would not be

2522
01:43:05,118 --> 01:43:12,598
surprised if Costco and Kmart also have

2523
01:43:10,118 --> 01:43:15,479
uh tasting rooms smoking rooms I mean

2524
01:43:12,599 --> 01:43:18,119
come on it's better for society The

2525
01:43:15,479 --> 01:43:20,718
Wider it spreads and you know some

2526
01:43:18,118 --> 01:43:25,118
people like Bud some people like you

2527
01:43:20,719 --> 01:43:27,039
know uh crap beer and

2528
01:43:25,118 --> 01:43:30,238
I I think there's room for

2529
01:43:27,039 --> 01:43:31,920
everybody yeah know the way it came in

2530
01:43:30,238 --> 01:43:33,479
through medical it doesn't seem like

2531
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:35,480
they're going to be able to pull it away

2532
01:43:33,479 --> 01:43:37,638
I mean here in Canada we have it's very

2533
01:43:35,479 --> 01:43:39,439
easy to get a license you can grow your

2534
01:43:37,639 --> 01:43:41,239
own even if you don't have a license you

2535
01:43:39,439 --> 01:43:43,359
can grow four plants everyone in the

2536
01:43:41,238 --> 01:43:46,559
country that's over 19 can grow four

2537
01:43:43,359 --> 01:43:48,198
plants but um if you want you just go

2538
01:43:46,560 --> 01:43:51,360
get yourself a license and you can grow

2539
01:43:48,198 --> 01:43:54,479
30 or 50 or 100 or 200 you know well

2540
01:43:51,359 --> 01:43:56,319
within reason uh it's not very difficult

2541
01:43:54,479 --> 01:43:57,959
um you know because cannabis is so

2542
01:43:56,319 --> 01:44:02,439
effective for inflammation really

2543
01:43:57,960 --> 01:44:04,880
anything with inflammation can get you a

2544
01:44:02,439 --> 01:44:06,799
permit so I'm surprised no one's trying

2545
01:44:04,880 --> 01:44:08,920
to done it like Christmas tree places

2546
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:11,760
where you can come buy a live Christmas

2547
01:44:08,920 --> 01:44:14,279
tree just go cut your tree that's a

2548
01:44:11,760 --> 01:44:16,719
nursery talking about that in Washington

2549
01:44:14,279 --> 01:44:18,559
but it's all the laws you know we've

2550
01:44:16,719 --> 01:44:20,679
been talking about that for patients

2551
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:22,520
specifically in in Co it's kind of

2552
01:44:20,679 --> 01:44:24,239
gotten the legislators a little more

2553
01:44:22,520 --> 01:44:25,920
open to look at this and that was one of

2554
01:44:24,238 --> 01:44:27,839
the things like hey we can bring a plant

2555
01:44:25,920 --> 01:44:29,158
all the way to fruition and they didn't

2556
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:30,840
they don't have to pay for the trimming

2557
01:44:29,158 --> 01:44:32,319
processing drying they can take it home

2558
01:44:30,840 --> 01:44:35,840
they can make it into oil whatever they

2559
01:44:32,319 --> 01:44:37,759
need to do um yeah you could have a

2560
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:41,719
freezer on site they could flash freeze

2561
01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:45,520
it so it's transportable yeah I I've

2562
01:44:41,719 --> 01:44:49,800
been pushing this idea for for 10 20

2563
01:44:45,520 --> 01:44:52,480
years and I absolutely agree and uh

2564
01:44:49,800 --> 01:44:55,400
economically I think if you grew a

2565
01:44:52,479 --> 01:44:59,000
100,000 plants and you sold them for

2566
01:44:55,399 --> 01:45:02,479
$100 each for a plant that can

2567
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:04,719
yield kilo or two uh after it's cleaned

2568
01:45:02,479 --> 01:45:07,000
and dried uh it's a lot of economic

2569
01:45:04,719 --> 01:45:09,439
sense but I think in California the laws

2570
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:12,319
are in the way at this moment but we can

2571
01:45:09,439 --> 01:45:15,079
change laws oh we've we've established

2572
01:45:12,319 --> 01:45:17,000
that we didn't like 215 we changed that

2573
01:45:15,079 --> 01:45:19,198
and we don't like 64 so we'll change

2574
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:22,359
that so if we just know what the

2575
01:45:19,198 --> 01:45:24,359
parameters are we'll faking fix it hell

2576
01:45:22,359 --> 01:45:27,519
yeah we did the same thing man we had

2577
01:45:24,359 --> 01:45:30,000
that uh the the amazing group The

2578
01:45:27,520 --> 01:45:31,719
Coalition that took on with John conro I

2579
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:34,238
took on the federal government here and

2580
01:45:31,719 --> 01:45:37,399
just basically destroyed the federal

2581
01:45:34,238 --> 01:45:39,559
government and maintain the ability to

2582
01:45:37,399 --> 01:45:43,039
grow change governments and that's what

2583
01:45:39,560 --> 01:45:45,199
Coalition did the medical community got

2584
01:45:43,039 --> 01:45:48,198
together and fought for a cause and we

2585
01:45:45,198 --> 01:45:49,879
won that was awesome patients stood up

2586
01:45:48,198 --> 01:45:51,439
for their rights and we stand up more

2587
01:45:49,880 --> 01:45:53,039
for cannabis than we have and it's great

2588
01:45:51,439 --> 01:45:55,039
to see we need the rest of the world

2589
01:45:53,039 --> 01:45:57,000
legalized don't we we got to do this for

2590
01:45:55,039 --> 01:45:58,729
everybody exactly what's happening here

2591
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:01,880
in Canada in different parts of the

2592
01:45:58,729 --> 01:46:03,959
[Music]

2593
01:46:01,880 --> 01:46:09,079
world access

2594

is every person for any reason anywhere

2595
01:46:09,079 --> 01:46:14,079
in the

2596
01:46:10,840 --> 01:46:14,079
world I

2597
01:46:15,800 --> 01:46:19,800
10 amen

2598
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:28,599
all right I'll talk what about these

2599
01:46:26,639 --> 01:46:31,639
amonita mushrooms behind me how sweet is

2600
01:46:28,599 --> 01:46:34,719
that saw those are those your house are

2601
01:46:31,639 --> 01:46:37,639
those local those are like literally in

2602
01:46:34,719 --> 01:46:39,960
the parking lot of my work yeah I have

2603
01:46:37,639 --> 01:46:41,639
those all over my yard these are they're

2604
01:46:39,960 --> 01:46:44,198
all over Richmond they're all over

2605
01:46:41,639 --> 01:46:46,079
Squamish which is both directions of my

2606
01:46:44,198 --> 01:46:49,359
from my house North and South they're

2607
01:46:46,079 --> 01:46:51,479
actually just fairly prolific in and

2608
01:46:49,359 --> 01:46:54,759
around

2609
01:46:51,479 --> 01:46:56,319
Vancouver I actually took some a couple

2610
01:46:54,760 --> 01:46:59,199
of

2611
01:46:56,319 --> 01:47:00,439
times and how did you like the amas

2612
01:46:59,198 --> 01:47:03,000
aren't you supposed to dry them and

2613
01:47:00,439 --> 01:47:06,559
smoke them isn't that the no you don't

2614
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:10,238
have to smoke them mine were dried I had

2615
01:47:06,560 --> 01:47:12,760
collected them in Santa Cruz and uh it

2616
01:47:10,238 --> 01:47:18,319
gives you it's it's sort of a

2617
01:47:12,760 --> 01:47:19,960
dispersal drug and uh it it it it makes

2618
01:47:18,319 --> 01:47:24,198
you sort of take

2619
01:47:19,960 --> 01:47:26,439
Daydreams where you have uh

2620
01:47:24,198 --> 01:47:29,919
dreams that you can remember

2621
01:47:26,439 --> 01:47:34,198
hallucination dreams or whatever it's uh

2622
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:37,199
yeah it it's not my idea of a good clean

2623
01:47:34,198 --> 01:47:40,399
psychedelic but uh there are people who

2624
01:47:37,198 --> 01:47:42,759
liked it I mean the ancient Vikings were

2625
01:47:40,399 --> 01:47:45,559
called Berserkers because they would eat

2626
01:47:42,760 --> 01:47:48,599
these and a funny thing about them is of

2627
01:47:45,560 --> 01:47:51,880
course that you could

2628
01:47:48,599 --> 01:47:55,239
take the urine from a reindeer that ate

2629
01:47:51,880 --> 01:47:58,199
them and cleaned out the impurities that

2630
01:47:55,238 --> 01:48:01,559
made you more sick if you can swallow

2631
01:47:58,198 --> 01:48:04,479
the reindeer piss and the Berserker

2632
01:48:01,560 --> 01:48:07,560
Vikings would pee into the bowls of

2633
01:48:04,479 --> 01:48:10,279
their servants who would eat it drink it

2634
01:48:07,560 --> 01:48:12,520
and and uh they actually had a better

2635
01:48:10,279 --> 01:48:15,158
trip than the Berserkers because the

2636
01:48:12,520 --> 01:48:17,119
mushrooms also have toxic chemicals

2637
01:48:15,158 --> 01:48:19,198
which are not passed along but the

2638
01:48:17,118 --> 01:48:22,399
Psychedelic is pretty much yeah the

2639
01:48:19,198 --> 01:48:24,799
psych the Psychedelic doesn't metabolize

2640
01:48:22,399 --> 01:48:28,238
in your liver it

2641
01:48:24,800 --> 01:48:29,880
it piss it out active it's

2642
01:48:28,238 --> 01:48:32,359
incredible

2643
01:48:29,880 --> 01:48:34,960
yeah if you going to harvest them it's

2644
01:48:32,359 --> 01:48:37,960
good to let dry them expose them to 130

2645
01:48:34,960 --> 01:48:39,960
de degrees so that 130 degrees will

2646
01:48:37,960 --> 01:48:42,599
break it Fahrenheit will break down the

2647
01:48:39,960 --> 01:48:45,079
hydren I believe is the poison that

2648
01:48:42,599 --> 01:48:45,079
causes the

2649
01:48:45,359 --> 01:48:51,198
nausea so Sam have you drank actual

2650
01:48:48,840 --> 01:48:55,279
reindeer

2651
01:48:51,198 --> 01:49:00,319
piss no I I had never seen that or a

2652
01:48:55,279 --> 01:49:03,359
Berserker piss but uh the uh I cannot

2653
01:49:00,319 --> 01:49:07,279
recommend these people uh it blurs your

2654
01:49:03,359 --> 01:49:09,039
vision it's not a true clear psychedelic

2655
01:49:07,279 --> 01:49:11,079
I I wouldn't be eating it I'll tell you

2656
01:49:09,039 --> 01:49:13,840
that much but I find them beautiful to

2657
01:49:11,079 --> 01:49:16,359
photograph and that's really why I share

2658
01:49:13,840 --> 01:49:20,520
reason they always remind me of Santa

2659
01:49:16,359 --> 01:49:20,519
Claus or maybe it's a

2660
01:49:20,719 --> 01:49:26,439
kabouter yeah well well why don't I

2661
