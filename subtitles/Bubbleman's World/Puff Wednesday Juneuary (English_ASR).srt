not sorry but uh no it sure feels like

11
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:47,280
summer I tell you we've uh we waited for

12
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,280
a while to film cuz there was all sorts

13
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,399
of different noises going on it isn't it

14
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,198
funny a helicopter first it was a

15
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,920
chainsaw then we had the planner then it

16
00:00:54,198 --> 00:00:58,159
was the planer then we had the chopsaw

17
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,440
we had the chopsaw we had the kid the

18
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:01,839
kid we had my son going off and

19
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:03,399
everything was doing really well we

20
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,719
doing helicopters all right we're cool

21
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:07,239
with it you know what we just decided

22
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:09,280
we'd rather film something uh which

23
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:11,319
really will probably consist of me and

24
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,879
Johnny sitting here puffing on our own

25
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:15,599
motherships John's got the straight Fab

26
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:18,719
with the ey dab drop down and the

27
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:21,759
silicon carbide nail from denail and

28
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:23,599
I've got the uh Fab egg from Mothership

29
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,719
as well as the straight Fab uh with the

30
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:30,879
pooking be the puking bee um quartz

31
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:33,200
crystal bowl and DM love lovely so why

32
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:36,599
don't we start this off with a rip I

33
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:39,200
think um I got some different nice sift

34
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:41,919
here that I've played up well I'm always

35
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,439
down for some of that you know I didn't

36
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,280
oh there's the helicopter I finally see

37
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:47,919
it it's way up there such a beautiful

38
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,200
day it's funny how certain people might

39
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,320
get it in their heads that on a

40
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,439
beautiful day like this the best thing

41
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:55,758
to do would probably be to light up uh

42
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:57,919
your leaf blower or light up your lawn

43
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,599
mower maybe go out and Hammer your nail

44
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,039
gun into the wall a couple thousand

45
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:02,919
times

46
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:04,879
maybe get your planer out maybe get your

47
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,519
chainsaw out maybe just run the boat

48
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:08,159
motor for a couple of hours straight

49
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:10,919
just you know filter the gas out of the

50
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:12,199
engine I don't know you made me laugh so

51
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:14,878
hard when you said this like it seems

52
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:17,238
like when the sun comes out a few people

53
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:19,039
decide they want to ruin it for

54
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:20,439
everybody else for the day well you know

55
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:22,679
what you guys can see the view right

56
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:24,239
this is the most epic of views we have

57
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,760
very few neighbors they're Fair they're

58
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:29,920
fairly sparse but because it's so quiet

59
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:32,479
that really any little noise you make

60
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:34,518
let alone a big noise is going to be

61
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:36,919
fairly heard by The Neighborhood uh for

62
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:39,280
instance I'm sure right now there are

63
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:41,719
people hearing our episode of puff

64
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,199
Wednesday while they just walk by on the

65
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:45,318
street or whether they're out on their

66
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:47,518
decks across you know n next door or

67
00:02:45,318 --> 00:02:50,280
across the street so what do we got here

68
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,319
a um that there whoa upside down that's

69
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:55,280
okay that's okay got a live that's going

70
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:57,280
to actually be the Afghan the Afghan and

71
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,360
that would be the the first bounce and

72
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,919
then I've taken it past the first bounce

73
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,120
then I've actually clean it all right

74
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:05,399
here we go Johnny stepping up his game

75
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,680
you might have heard me in hash Church

76
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,039
the other day saying John come on step

77
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,040
up your game you're so close that last

78
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:13,598
little bit well it seems makes sense

79
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:15,199
right cuz I grow my own res and I put

80
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:16,798
all the own effort into it why wouldn't

81
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:18,119
I be cleaning it look at that Johnny

82
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:20,799
which cuz I was just like that's

83
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:25,959

85
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:31,759
everybody

86
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:48,680
notice your thumb was on the

87
00:03:45,878 --> 00:03:50,518
carb cool eh I didn't notice for the

88
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,159
first few few hits I took that that

89
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:53,879
thing had a carb on it this thing right

90
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:56,598
the little hole yeah I know and I

91
00:03:53,878 --> 00:03:58,878
watched you do that so when I I saw that

92
00:03:56,598 --> 00:04:00,679
beautiful little carb C there a couple

93
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:02,679
well what I really like it is it fits on

94
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:05,680
the silicone carbide which is a monster

95
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:07,799
nail you can see how other caps fit in

96
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,719
it but inevitably that just gets the

97
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:11,120
outside of the cap kind of nasty dirty I

98
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:13,000
don't think you like the original cap

99
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,759
that big metal piece that went on I do

100
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,199
like it there's just a few things that

101
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:19,238
I'm nervous about other people using it

102
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,919
on this pipe I wouldn't be as much but

103
00:04:19,238 --> 00:04:25,159
this piece where it's right here that if

104
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:27,159
it fell it would just hit the egg O

105
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:29,759
can't do that I worry I have to admit

106
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:32,080
since uh since seeing Brett Maverick's

107
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,360
Broken Egg on Instagram there and just

108
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:37,478
knowing that glass break seeing glass

109
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:39,879
break over the years I really take

110
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:42,399
Precious care as much as I you know I I

111
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:44,959
clean these things every day but as

112
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:48,239
often as I clean them I still take very

113
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:51,000
precious care to make sure that their uh

114
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:54,439
their safety is secured here you go oh

115

wow that was bigger than I thought

137
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:08,279

00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:10,080
that's how big that rip was mine's still

smoldering that's what the carb cap

140
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:12,839
comes in handy for

141
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:20,439

142
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,960
dabbers if they get

143
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:27,199

was a little sore yeah I guess coughing

150
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:48,758
can uh cause you a little pain when

151
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:50,758
you're got a sore back and a sore neck

which is okay um you know what it's it's

166
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:22,598
my health and stuff but I mean I'm not

167
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:24,639
stopping um uh looking at I I'm always

168
00:07:22,598 --> 00:07:26,159
locking the standing leg right you know

169
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,800
what I mean it's it's about your health

170
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,160
and stuff like that so paying a little

171
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,120
bit more attention to certain things

172
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:34,199
mean mass as natural supplements eating

173
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:37,120

little hit of the diesel oh wow it's

179
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:50,038
looking

180
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:53,000
proper God it's just such a beautiful

181
00:07:50,038 --> 00:07:54,680
relaxing puff wed I'm just you know it's

182
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,199
nice it's thinking about the the new

183
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:58,519
growing season that's coming up we're

184
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,038
talking about the outdoors we want to

185
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:02,439
start doing oh yeah you know like just a

186
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:04,918
few of the plants to see how they're

187
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:06,918
going to well that outdoor resident I

188
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:09,560
would really really really like to take

189
00:08:06,918 --> 00:08:11,519
a better look on this year's crop that

190
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:14,598
I've never paid attention to which is

191
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:15,959
going to be the stock and and just uh

192
00:08:14,598 --> 00:08:18,639
what the difference is between the

193
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:20,239
indoor and outdoor stock because

194
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,439
something was brought up with uh you

195
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,639
know like with the inside LED light we

196
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:27,158
found that the stock in the center was

197
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,918
was more healthier where with the LED it

198
00:08:27,158 --> 00:08:31,680
was it was thicker and heavier which

199
00:08:28,918 --> 00:08:34,439
actually even healthier right so it's

200
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,000
interesting looking yep we're always

201
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,479
we're always curious interesting

202
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,320
information if you guys haven't already

203
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:41,639
checked out hash Church obviously check

204
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:44,080
out those episodes there's 22 of them 19

205
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:46,759
was awesome on the lighting 22 Episodes

206
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,879
far episode 22 was all G like dude I'm

207
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:51,120
telling you they've all got gems in them

208
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:53,879
oh even every single one's got a gem

209
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:56,720
it's probably like 40 hours of them but

210
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:59,000
uh or maybe more maybe maybe 80 hours of

211
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,600
I actually have pieces of paper written

212
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,360
with a has on the top and you I have

213
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,000
times and people talking to go back and

214
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,200
reference nice yeah I'm sure there's a

215
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,078
few people out there that's what you got

216
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,879
to do because it's there's so much good

217
00:09:07,078 --> 00:09:13,519
information being passed on there it's

218
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:17,519
uh it's hard not to not watch

219
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,519
pastri I'm pretty sure you guys all

220
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:26,360
are man loving this FB bag I got to say

221
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:28,120
kind of missed the drop down I was I was

222
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:30,800
I really enjoying the drop down on it

223
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:33,159
but uh I think one that's a little bit

224
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:35,000
smaller is in order for the Fab EG this

225
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:36,559
one's a really good side size for the

226
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,240
straight

227
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:41,759
Fab one that's a little bit

228
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,440
smaller for the Fab bag I'm sure it'll

229
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:46,039
uh come down the pipeline here in the

230
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:49,040
near near future I made that this one

231
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:51,799
nice which one's this Barb

232
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:55,039
yeah nice look at that I like how this

233
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:56,679
looks like silver okay yeah like if in

234
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:59,399
the right shade of the light it

235
00:09:56,679 --> 00:10:03,479
literally looks like pieces of silver

236
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:04,639
are on the rim of the I mean really uh

237
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,240
I'm telling you though the Barb is

238
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:07,799
special resin though did I not tell you

239
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,600
that from day one I know that's why I

240
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:12,759
have in my garden I mean look at it dude

241
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,040
it's ridiculous it's ridiculous and and

242
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:16,039
I'll show you guys don't worry I'll take

243
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:18,039
some macro photos and I'll do a nice

244
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:19,360
little closeup of video with it as well

245
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:21,439
cuz in the sunlight it just looks

246
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:25,440
beautiful doesn't it look beautiful I

247
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:28,399
mean did you hit this uh nycd oh did did

248
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,680
you Happ hit that no I just hit the nycd

249
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,679
I'll hit this a few seconds after you

250
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:34,479
hit one of those so that you don't have

251
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:36,838
to uh back to

252
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:39,519
back and then the only thing I would say

253
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:42,399
with this nail is kind of as you're

254
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:45,959
using it you just lightly any little

255
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:48,519
minimal amounts of carbon carbon little

256
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:50,359
residuals that are left I just lightly

257
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:52,560
scrape off and then I usually pick up

258
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:54,480
the bomb kind of hold it over the edge

259
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:56,359
you know CL towards yeah and then but

260
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,839
with my eyes closed cuz wow getting that

261
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:02,039
in your eye I got it in my eye one time

262
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:04,079
and I'll tell it was not a good plan it

263
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:06,078
was in Jamaica on my last trip and I

264
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:09,399
blew the silicone carbide

265
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:11,039
nail man [ __ ] went right in my eye and

266
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:13,399
it wasn't until the next day that I felt

267
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:14,838
better was kind of a never want to muck

268
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:16,039
up your eye when you're out traveling I

269
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:18,360
mean really you never want to muck out

270
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:19,719
your eye anywhere but doing it while

271
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,759
you're out and about in a different

272
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:27,320
country is

273
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:29,319
freaky tasty hey so tasty so good so

274
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,160
good interesting though how it's

275
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:33,000
buttered

276
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:37,120
out like I was barely able to put put

277
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:39,039
that into uh into uh a a piece I was

278
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:42,159
barely able to press that into a solid

279
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:45,120
piece of hash it seems to have absorbed

280
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:45,120
some moisture from the

281
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:53,000
air well that's the problem even with

282
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:53,000
the the medy here I opened it up and it

283
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:59,639
uhp ITP put a dirty

284
00:11:57,159 --> 00:12:01,399
down but there's another one that I went

285
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:05,480
spent

286
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:08,240
uh well I had to step it up yeah why not

287
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:10,560
it's worth it and I can tell

288
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:14,399
you what a

289
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:15,958
difference I know it's like what a

290
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:19,159
difference when you really start when

291
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:21,679
you get those screens out yeah and and

292
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:23,600
without them you cannot get what you get

293
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:25,039
John's talking about the dry sift quiver

294
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,720
for those of you that may have missed

295
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:27,919
the boat and don't know about it you get

296
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,278
you can check these out at bubble

297
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:30,838
bag.com

298
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:34,240
you go on the left side and look under

299
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:37,079
dryy sift tools and it's uh yeah it's

300
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:40,720
there it's just there like it's

301
00:12:37,078 --> 00:12:42,958
it's it's it's just for me every time

302
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,240
it's I get lazy I was doing the first

303
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:45,479
bounce and I thought it was really nice

304
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,000
and then I was bringing you resin to

305
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,480
clean for me and stuff like that and

306
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,799
then I was stuck in Horatio with bring

307
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,639
me some really nice and and then it was

308
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:54,439
just a matter of sitting down and uh

309
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:57,039
after spending so much uh love and

310
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:59,760
growing it and and this time I decided

311
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:02,078
to uh dry sift it all yeah good and uh

312
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:04,600
last time I was uh I was fresh frozen

313
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:06,359
and stuff like that so um and I always

314
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,639
talk about you know the dry SI for me I

315
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,000
was always carding for hours and it was

316
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:13,639
that's why I got away from it a little

317
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:17,159
bit but now with with with with with

318
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:19,039
just the the temperatures the humidities

319
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:21,039
I paid a big attention to and I talked

320
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:22,198
about that you talked about me all the

321
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:23,519
time you need to get the temperatures

322
00:13:22,198 --> 00:13:26,240
down cold you got to get the humidities

323
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,519
down cold so so that's what I've done

324
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,039
I've now taken it to get those

325
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:33,240
humidities down to 30% Mak the

326
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:36,439
temperatures and and with that hands

327
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:40,440
down the resin is coming out perfect and

328
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:43,519
and and then the curing at at at those

329
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:47,399
temperates nice

330
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:50,600
so want to hear your Jamaican yes see

331
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:53,078

333
00:13:53,078 --> 00:13:56,399

tasty

335
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:11,000
she's a melty God and she smells so

336
00:14:08,278 --> 00:14:13,480
unique it's hard to really explain it's

337
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,240
just a smell that I don't recognize

338
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,240
every time I smell

339
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,320
it just

340
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,240
different my God ready for something

341
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:33,639
different there's our planer there's the

342
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:35,198
planer we got the planer we got all

343
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:37,240
sorts of different sounds here on Bubble

344
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:39,159
as well I can pretty much um say next

345
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:41,799
time the that was just the first bounce

346
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:44,559
of the Jamaican left friend

347
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:46,679
yeah now we got to clean it yeah no

348
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:48,319
exactly now now now I got to take we

349
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:50,039
just wait until we have like a kilo of

350
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,240
this and we can clean it down to like

351
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:55,639
100 gram

352
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:58,198
oh oh the flavor I've been puffing all

353
00:14:55,639 --> 00:15:00,639
this all the last week all my resin I've

354
00:14:58,198 --> 00:15:03,399
been cleaning and I got that and I just

355
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:05,839
like smiled oh yeah because it's it's so

356
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:08,799
unique just wait until it's grown with

357
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:11,079
the Tropical Sun you know cuz as much as

358
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:13,319
we want to try right now we know that

359
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:15,838
our lights are insufficient

360
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:18,720
yes obviously it's going to be hard to

361
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:22,000
create a light that uh can compete with

362
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:25,320
that giant glowing orb in the

363
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:28,078
sky it's good to try I salute all of you

364
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:30,759
that are but at the same time wow Su

365
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:31,799
grown resonance is going to be the

366
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:33,399
something that I'm really looking

367
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:34,958
forward to in the future of all these

368
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:36,480
different projects that are uh being

369
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:40,439
worked

370
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:43,000
on couple more grapes if you had a grape

371
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:45,880
Johnny pretty

372
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:49,480
good I mean uh I had a

373
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:51,519
greate Jamaican outdoor grown resin come

374
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:53,600
on we already know where it's going to

375
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:55,919
be

376
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,920
at yeah it'll certainly be a unique that

377
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:59,599
whole light spectrum and the difference

378
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:01,879
between the indoor

379
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,920
outdoor and what we've been trying to

380
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:06,838
achieve for the last well since light

381
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:09,318
bulbs is outdoor spectrum and and with

382
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:10,839
the Sun every there's many many

383
00:16:09,318 --> 00:16:11,919
countries in the world will be able to

384
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:14,959
become

385
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:17,278
contenders for growing a unique

386
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:18,679
cannaboid profile a unique turpine

387

489
00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:45,720
year here and right now it must be 13 or

490
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:48,319
14° C there was no snow on the local

491
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,960
mountains I came over today are they CL

492
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:52,038
beautiful view well there's no snow they

493
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:54,759
must be closed 100% has to be closed

494
00:20:52,038 --> 00:20:56,079
Gross Mountain has got no snow zero you

495
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:59,400
see the whole Runway going all the way

496
00:20:56,079 --> 00:21:02,759
up to the peak like it's unbelievable

497
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:05,840
still I remember I remember 10 years ago

498
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:08,359
when I was skiing all 15 years ago going

499
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:10,599
to go wow see I'm yeah in my 40s now so

500
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:12,959
let's step that back 15 years ago when I

501
00:21:10,599 --> 00:21:14,599
was 20 years ago when I was skiing we

502
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,120
were skiing to April 30th when they

503
00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:17,079
supposed to close and then we stay open

504
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:19,239
for the another two weeks cuz there's

505
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:20,678
still snow on the mountains oh yeah and

506
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:25,120
and the difference when you hear a

507
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:27,519
chainsaw or a planer please take a hit

508
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:30,558
it'll be a game we do

509
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:32,200
uhoh could be kind of fun little puff

510

cold in any way that that is actually

518
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:52,000
that one that that might be the Afghan

519
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:53,038
this one might be the afan cuz I clean

520
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,038

521
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:57,480
morning well I'm going to take a rip of

522
00:21:55,038 --> 00:21:59,119
it and find out and like I did an extra

523
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:01,000
clean that's why I was like look The

524
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:03,239
House of the great Gardener House of the

525
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,240
great

526
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:08,479
Gardener House of the great

527
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:12,158
Gardener House of the great

528
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:14,278
chainsaw house the great wood plane

529
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:16,600
backing up the car house the helicopter

530
00:22:14,278 --> 00:22:19,880
House of the backing up of the car there

531
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:24,558
we go pretty much uh we I'm I'm being

532
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:24,559
called out here with the sound of the

533
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:30,519
Chainsaw

534
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,359
no this is The Afghani I

535
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:49,879
think that's real creamy and melted like

536
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,519
water that's what I was trying to

537
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:57,439
achieve start to cough like a maniac too

538
00:22:54,519 --> 00:22:59,480
water meltin got some right here

539
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,320
nice

540
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:04,079
well it's always much easier when you

541
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:05,519
control the variables there are hash

542
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:07,158
makers that they get their material

543
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:10,879
given to them and then there are hash

544
00:23:07,159 --> 00:23:14,320
makers that either a grow their material

545
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:16,200
or have their or are in control of in

546
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:18,759
control of growing their material you

547
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:21,240
know uh talking with um some different

548
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:24,200
hash makers recently I find that the

549
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:26,359
guys that are able to grow their own on

550
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:28,919
a large enough scale that they can

551
00:23:26,359 --> 00:23:31,119
actually produce decent amounts of resin

552
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:33,278
have really they they seem to shine a

553
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:34,879
little bit above uh the rest you know

554
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:36,599
the people that are using trim and

555
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,159
whatnot to make to make their hash it's

556
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:41,678
hard to compete with a guy who's growing

557
00:23:39,159 --> 00:23:45,159
dank bud and then using that bud to make

558
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:47,038
say um The Growers they have the Holy

559
00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:49,480
Grail of

560
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:51,919
hash cuz the first

561
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:54,480
bounce and now that you I mean that

562
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:55,759
that's what you want so if you're buying

563
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,759
butt you're doing it I'm sorry you're

564
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:59,038
just not getting exactly what what the

565
00:23:57,759 --> 00:24:01,480
grow is going to achieve

566
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:03,319
right they they get the Epic it hangs

567
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:05,519
it's perfect it's right there we're

568
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:07,278
control of everything we control of the

569
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:10,400
everything I control that whole plant

570
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:13,919
take a bom R yeah and do one

571
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,919
too it's going

572
00:24:14,798 --> 00:24:17,960

578
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,120
mystery we don't know we could end up on

579
00:24:36,038 --> 00:24:41,240
a boat driving around the house sound

580
00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:43,918
looking for killer whales if we do we'll
