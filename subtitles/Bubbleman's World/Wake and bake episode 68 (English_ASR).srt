00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:10,710
welcome to the wake-and-bake episode 68

4
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:12,149
in the house and today we're going to

5
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:18,289
give away something a little different

6
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:22,410
we're gonna give away an MTG hat it's uh

7
00:00:18,289 --> 00:00:24,539
grow big or grow home I kind of left

8
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:26,759
this hat I had one myself that fit

9
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:28,920
perfect I lost it in Jamaica in Kingston

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,080
I remember driving in this guy's car and

11
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,719
we had all the windows open at one point

12
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:35,759
my hat blew off inside his car and it

13
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:38,609
went right to the back of the car not

14
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:40,229
the back seat but the back and I was all

15
00:00:38,609 --> 00:00:42,030
excited getting dropped off at a buddy's

16
00:00:40,229 --> 00:00:43,589
house in Uptown Kingston we were gonna

17
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:46,469
go dirtbike riding which I made a video

18
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:49,020
of and it's on bubble man's world anyway

19
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:51,780
I never went back and got the Hat so I

20
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:54,359
lost it so I'm gonna give this one away

21
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:58,289
today it doesn't fit me it's a 7 and 3/8

22
00:00:54,359 --> 00:01:00,719
all right 7 and 3/8 this means don't

23
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:03,179
guess the answer if your head is way

24
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,680
bigger or way smaller I mean unless you

25
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:06,478
just really kind of want to have but I'd

26
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,720
love to see this hat go to someone that

27
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:12,780
actually fits their head Keegan

28
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:14,429
someone like Keegan or someone else

29
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,259
whatever I'm good to go with whoever

30
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:18,900
wants to win it and the question is

31
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:20,250
gonna be simple I want you to understand

32
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,500
that the question I'm looking for a

33
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:25,379
specific meaning that if you abbreviate

34
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:27,780
if you use a different term if you don't

35
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:31,078
say exactly what I said in the video

36
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:34,259
that I'm about to link you with it's not

37
00:01:31,078 --> 00:01:37,589
gonna be a win so those of you whose

38
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:39,209
size hat this is alright alright alright

39
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:41,219
I know it's gonna be impossible to get

40
00:01:39,209 --> 00:01:42,809
everyone else to stop guessing as well

41
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:45,840
but I really would be disappointed if

42
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:48,210
someone wins this hat and it's it's you

43
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,859
know under a in a box under a desk

44
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:52,819
somewhere much like this one's been

45
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:55,890
sitting for probably over a year now so

46
00:01:52,819 --> 00:01:58,109
I'm about to tell you what the video was

47
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:05,489

54
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:23,650
minute of the video in the first minute

55
00:02:18,848 --> 00:02:26,348
of the video I pull out a white little

56
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:27,280
tub with some something-something in it

57

there's that we've given away something

78
00:03:25,628 --> 00:03:31,568
why don't we get now to the puffing had

79
00:03:29,769 --> 00:03:33,310
the West Coast guys well the East Coast

80
00:03:31,568 --> 00:03:35,018
guys I guess they're the East Coast guys

81
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:37,750
now they got their new packaging here if

82
00:03:35,019 --> 00:03:41,590
he goes around Toronto they brought some

83
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:43,329
Larry lemon Larry og flower rosin which

84
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:46,930
was okay pretty pretty nice you know a

85
00:03:43,329 --> 00:03:48,729
little bit dark for my likes but that's

86
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:51,010
okay they also brought me their

87
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:53,199
distillate I'm not a distillate guy but

88
00:03:51,009 --> 00:03:55,090
they wanted me to check it out and I was

89
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:57,879
probably gonna do a little experimenting

90
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:59,408
with adding some turps to this I won't

91
00:03:57,878 --> 00:04:01,810
be puffing on it but we'll see what my

92
00:03:59,408 --> 00:04:03,698
friends think and so that is their

93
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:06,609
distillate right there quite clear

94
00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:10,000
almost no color to the west coast East

95
00:04:06,609 --> 00:04:12,099
Coast distillate and there is that oh

96
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,219
yeah they also sent me this little bit

97
00:04:12,098 --> 00:04:17,139
of butter rosin which is also very nice

98
00:04:15,219 --> 00:04:19,930
it's very barely sitting on there so it

99
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:21,900
could slip off so we have all sorts of

100
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:25,860
lovely options for puffing this morning

101
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:28,079
yeah west coast of good guys I met with

102
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:29,280
Jim Ian and Brett from West Coast

103
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:31,949
yesterday and we had a nice little

104
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:33,839
conversation and it was good to see

105
00:04:31,949 --> 00:04:35,699
those guys because they've been out on

106
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:37,739
the East Coast for the longest time oh I

107
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:39,449
don't really smoke chemical solvent

108
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:43,530
extracts myself

109
00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:47,069
I'm not a big distillates BHO hexane

110
00:04:43,529 --> 00:04:49,769
propane guy okay Josh Warner see you

111
00:04:47,069 --> 00:04:51,689
later have a good one but at the same

112
00:04:49,769 --> 00:04:55,279
time I would sure fight for someone's

113
00:04:51,689 --> 00:04:58,410
right - presumably there is no solvent

114
00:04:55,279 --> 00:05:01,258
list distillate well that's correct in a

115
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:03,360
sense most so all distillates that I

116
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:05,788
know of are washed with solvents like

117
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,900
ethanol or something and then run

118
00:05:05,788 --> 00:05:10,348
through short paths molecular

119
00:05:06,899 --> 00:05:12,959
distillation units the problem is is if

120
00:05:10,348 --> 00:05:15,389
it's been sprayed with pesticides you

121
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:17,668
can't get them out what's going on Brad

122
00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:20,870
kay oh look at that I got some torch

123
00:05:17,668 --> 00:05:20,870
torch action here

124
00:05:21,649 --> 00:05:26,668
here's your best dry sniff tip

125
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:28,350
I don't know man get great material I

126
00:05:26,668 --> 00:05:31,949
mean it couldn't be better than that

127
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:33,360
use exceptional material I couldn't give

128
00:05:31,949 --> 00:05:35,279
you a better dry sip tip than that

129
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,610
honestly like that is as accurate as it

130
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:37,829
gets

131
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:43,290
don't bother [ __ ] around the garbage

132
00:05:37,829 --> 00:05:44,930
it's just a waste of time energy and not

133
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:47,310
worth it really

134
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:49,829
most distillate is made from complete

135
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:51,300
garbage Wow let's just be honest a lot

136
00:05:49,829 --> 00:05:54,959
of distillate is made from complete

137
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:58,490
garbage not all of it but a lot of it is

138
00:05:54,959 --> 00:06:01,469
I've known a lot of people that you know

139
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:04,110
trying to get that prohibition dollar

140
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:05,639
back out of cannabis as cannabis was

141
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:07,860
lowering the price and as we were

142
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:09,509
getting these great prices you know the

143
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:11,250
oil game stepped right up and said hey

144
00:06:09,509 --> 00:06:13,168
guess what we'll still take those

145
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:15,329
prohibition prices and it's still pretty

146
00:06:13,168 --> 00:06:17,039
high up there but luckily you know once

147
00:06:15,329 --> 00:06:21,120
people start making this on a larger

148
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:22,830
agricultural level we'll have the price

149
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,720
go down obviously it's not going to be

150
00:06:22,829 --> 00:06:27,509
this expensive forever I'm sure some

151
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,940
people would love it to be but um it's

152
00:06:27,509 --> 00:06:31,978
just not gonna be the case there's too

153
00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:35,240
many options all right what am I looking

154

00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:24,910
yeah Tyler he's a cutie

166
00:07:30,899 --> 00:07:39,359
it was really amazing that he let me do

167
00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:41,889
it I I spent 12 hours with him yesterday

168
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,250
at the beach and all over the place and

169
00:07:41,889 --> 00:07:46,800
we had a great time nothing better than

170
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:57,279
you know spending time with the youth

171
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:59,590
such amazing inspirations all right four

172
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:01,599
completely white heads one gram dad one

173
00:07:59,589 --> 00:08:04,329
gram Deb oh my god I couldn't think of

174
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:06,490
something more waste worthy than taking

175
00:08:04,329 --> 00:08:10,479
one grab dab right now but I will take a

176
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:15,970
nice little rip of this who is it master

177
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:17,850
kosher Paula Piera Paul piera is the

178
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:22,360
strain on that one and the other

179
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:25,510
cultivar was oh yeah the lemon Larry the

180
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:27,160
lemon laude all right hey it's not a

181
00:08:25,509 --> 00:08:28,899
waste if you love it and it's for you

182
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:31,800
and you want it I just I'm not I have

183
00:08:28,899 --> 00:08:36,819
zero interest in taking one gram Debs

184
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:39,060
like zero maybe when I was 17 I'd have

185
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:42,709
been all over that [ __ ]

186
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:46,838
lemon Larry for the win

187
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:46,838
let's get our dabs up shall we everybody

188
00:08:48,269 --> 00:08:52,970
to talk a little bit about what's going

189
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:55,789
on in there in the community these days

190
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:57,720
you know as they want to legalize

191
00:08:55,789 --> 00:08:59,669
decriminalize whatever you want to call

192
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,439
it yes 800 grams Keegan

193
00:08:59,669 --> 00:09:02,789
that's not dry no why don't you go on

194
00:09:01,438 --> 00:09:05,009
the website because you're gonna [ __ ]

195
00:09:02,789 --> 00:09:07,799
that up the website says everything the

196
00:09:05,009 --> 00:09:10,769
dry weights are very simple 56 grams for

197
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:14,068
if 1 gallon 200 grams for a 5-gallon

198
00:09:10,769 --> 00:09:16,769
1,000 grams for a 20 gallon so those are

199
00:09:14,068 --> 00:09:18,748
dry weights now you multiply by 4 or 5

200
00:09:16,769 --> 00:09:20,698
those dry weights to get the weight of

201
00:09:18,749 --> 00:09:23,249
fresh frozen that you would run in the

202
00:09:20,698 --> 00:09:26,969
same size kit so you're confusing the 5

203
00:09:23,249 --> 00:09:28,350
gallon wet fresh frozen with dry so it's

204
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:30,149
very important not to confuse those

205
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:33,269
numbers because Wow can that ever [ __ ]

206
00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:36,240
you up and I don't want you to have have

207
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:42,600
a [ __ ] up there like that yeah chat does

208
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:43,980
move pretty quick well that's right you

209
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,499
heard it backwards but I for sure

210
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:48,300
probably did not say it backwards cuz

211
00:09:46,499 --> 00:09:51,028
well this is just one of those things

212
00:09:48,299 --> 00:09:53,609
that are I don't really I just know it

213
00:09:51,028 --> 00:09:56,818
it's like ingrained in me I know it like

214
00:09:53,610 --> 00:10:00,169
I know anything oh yeah I've been

215
00:09:56,818 --> 00:10:00,169
watching that as well track home city

216
00:10:09,769 --> 00:10:13,409
if you don't have anything positive to

217
00:10:11,909 --> 00:10:15,110
say sometimes it's best not to say

218
00:10:13,409 --> 00:10:19,799
anything at all

219
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:22,050
Mark's very opinionated he's got strong

220
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:27,419
opinions and I guess he said some

221
00:10:22,049 --> 00:10:30,509
negative things about the LGBTQ

222
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:31,349
community which obviously is you know

223
00:10:30,509 --> 00:10:33,029
you don't wanna be saying anything

224
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:36,149
negative about any community regardless

225
00:10:33,029 --> 00:10:39,659
of whether you see their way or not

226
00:10:36,149 --> 00:10:45,959
whether you agree with it or not you

227
00:10:39,659 --> 00:10:48,779
just have to let people live their life

228
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:51,420
I mean honestly I'm down with whatever

229
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:53,490
people want to identify as you know if

230
00:10:51,419 --> 00:10:57,659
they want to identify as a man as a

231
00:10:53,490 --> 00:11:00,419
woman as a [ __ ] lion I support it

232
00:10:57,659 --> 00:11:01,949
it doesn't affect me it's you know just

233
00:11:00,419 --> 00:11:05,879
support people let people do what they

234
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:07,710
want to do you know you know people so

235
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:09,809
are so worried about the world changing

236
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:12,300
in the world is changing the world is

237
00:11:09,809 --> 00:11:13,799
not gonna be recognizable in the next 20

238
00:11:12,299 --> 00:11:17,969
to 30 years for a lot of people that

239
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:20,789
live in it so you know just do you just

240
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:22,850
do you and don't worry about about

241
00:11:20,789 --> 00:11:25,199
anyone else that's right Roger Cobb

242
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:28,230
live-and-let-live I think it's a fairly

243
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:31,620
simple method a fairly simple rule to

244
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:33,570
follow I do plan to make another pure

245
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:35,250
hash joint video stoner Smurf you know I

246
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:37,080
think the next one will be out on a boat

247
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:44,909
and maybe we'll smoke like five or six

248
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:49,680
of them we are indeed the pioneers of

249
00:11:44,909 --> 00:11:50,730
change yes yes exactly Jay plot and we

250
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:52,620
don't want to be affecting anyone

251
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:56,159
survival health well-being or freedom

252
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:57,690
happiness whatever those things are and

253
00:11:56,159 --> 00:12:00,000
we don't really you know like it's

254
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:01,920
sometimes it's unnecessary I mean often

255
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,809
it's unnecessary to say something that's

256
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:07,139
just hurtful and mean for no good reason

257
00:12:03,809 --> 00:12:09,479
I mean why would you do it why would you

258
00:12:07,139 --> 00:12:11,759
do it you know I guess because we're

259
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:14,200
insecure and when we get insecure we

260
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:16,899
lash out we say negative thing

261
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:22,120
we become well we become the fallible

262
00:12:16,899 --> 00:12:24,340
human beings that we are are the hash

263
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:26,169
joint six star oh gosh no bingo you

264
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:28,780
could never smoke a six star hashed past

265
00:12:26,169 --> 00:12:31,779
joint it would melt right off the tip

266
00:12:28,779 --> 00:12:34,959
the hash joints are specifically mixed

267
00:12:31,779 --> 00:12:37,959
with a lower grade of hash like a 1 60

268
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:40,509
or 120 DRI sift mixed in with some nice

269
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:43,810
bubble and he's got the ratio right down

270
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:46,600
for producing the perfect paper that he

271
00:12:43,809 --> 00:12:48,369
then rolls into which becomes the hash

272
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,590
spliff the paper of course is made out

273
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:52,539
of hash he flattens it out and I'm not

274
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:54,970
sure if he's rolling it over a toothpick

275
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:56,169
or what exactly he's doing I've asked

276
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:58,180
him on a few occasions if he wanted to

277
00:12:56,169 --> 00:12:59,919
share the the technique and the method

278
00:12:58,179 --> 00:13:03,009
and he was kind of a little bit leery

279
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:04,449
but maybe one day we'll get him in the

280
00:13:03,009 --> 00:13:05,830
least I will be ordering some more of

281
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,540
those joints in the near future and

282
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:09,040
doing a video I still can't believe

283
00:13:07,539 --> 00:13:11,409
there's over a million views on that

284
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:13,449
video just from sitting at my desk one

285
00:13:11,409 --> 00:13:15,370
day and smoking a hash joy you never

286
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:18,580
know through social media how many

287
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:21,429
people you can touch I mean I'm happy to

288
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:22,629
touch 100 to 200 of you each well I

289
00:13:21,429 --> 00:13:24,549
guess it ends up being a couple of

290
00:13:22,629 --> 00:13:27,700
thousand to three thousand each

291
00:13:24,549 --> 00:13:29,349
wake-and-bake video but that's I'm happy

292
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:35,620
with that so you can imagine when you

293
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:38,290
get suddenly get something like 1.3 1.4

294
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:40,870
million people that is an enormous

295
00:13:38,289 --> 00:13:42,699
amount of people much larger than the

296
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:44,470
thought of like a stadium that the

297
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:46,540
Rolling Stones would sell out or even

298
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:48,850
like one of those Russian concerts that

299
00:13:46,539 --> 00:13:53,289
Metallica would sell out four or five

300
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:56,409
hundred thousand people 1.3 1.2 million

301
00:13:53,289 --> 00:13:58,000
people it's just well Shawn Zoe I think

302
00:13:56,409 --> 00:13:59,679
we know enough I think we know each

303
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,240
other well enough now that you can just

304
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:03,489
let me have a little touch but don't you

305
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:09,370
think just a little touch come on man

306
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:12,940
don't be so so uh prude are you prude

307
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:14,740
so another bond rip I think and we'll

308
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:16,140
finish it off it's a short one 14

309
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:18,399
minutes gave a little something away

310
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:20,559
dropped a little bit of knowledge not

311
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,449
too much today the hash knowledge will

312
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:25,449
come I'm still writing the blog if you

313
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:26,350
can imagine Hoffa add a bonsai breeder

314
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:28,820
half a

315
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:30,230
yeah still writing this blog so this

316
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:33,770
should hopefully go up I'm down to the

317
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:35,480
45 micron bag so once I get all the bags

318
00:14:33,769 --> 00:14:37,278
emptied I'll now start going through the

319
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:40,190
process of how to break it up properly

320
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:41,059
and then how to dry it properly it's

321
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:43,910
gonna be pretty good

322
00:14:41,059 --> 00:14:46,369
and what else what else what else oh

323
00:14:43,909 --> 00:14:48,500
[ __ ] you know I should say r.i.p to

324
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:51,769
Micky Martin I never really knew Mickey

325
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:53,958
Martin to me he seemed like this real

326
00:14:51,769 --> 00:14:56,750
kind of troll II internet character that

327
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:58,909
was just like trolling everyone at epic

328
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:02,149
levels but apparently it was a really

329
00:14:58,909 --> 00:15:04,789
amazing guy a family man a proponent of

330
00:15:02,149 --> 00:15:06,830
medical cannabis and after seeing so

331
00:15:04,789 --> 00:15:09,409
many of my friends in the community say

332
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:13,100
nice things about him in his passing of

333
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:15,169
course which was crazy cuz you just it's

334
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:17,629
wild to sort of see like here you got

335
00:15:15,169 --> 00:15:20,269
marc emery saying a bunch of ignorant

336
00:15:17,629 --> 00:15:21,950
[ __ ] to fuel the whole community to hate

337
00:15:20,269 --> 00:15:23,329
him and he's got lots of people jumping

338
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:25,399
on him right now for the some of the

339
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:27,770
comments that he made there even jumping

340
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:30,649
on Jodie it's kind of harsh actually cuz

341
00:15:27,769 --> 00:15:32,689
she never made the comments but yeah

342
00:15:30,649 --> 00:15:34,700
they're jumping all over Marc and in the

343
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:36,860
meantime this guy Mickey who was very

344
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:39,079
much a troll like character like he was

345
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:41,120
a troll on the internet he had the [ __ ]

346
00:15:39,078 --> 00:15:43,549
Mickey Awards if you can imagine which

347
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,860
mark of course won many years in a row

348
00:15:43,549 --> 00:15:47,958
it was just interesting to see I guess

349
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:50,120
when we passed we just everyone's gonna

350
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:52,519
say the nicest things about us and so

351
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:54,649
Mickey had some really incredible things

352
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:57,049
to say they had some incredible things

353
00:15:54,649 --> 00:15:58,759
to say about Mickey so our IP and I

354
00:15:57,049 --> 00:16:00,049
raised my bong to you Mickey I never

355
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:02,269
really knew you didn't have the

356
00:16:00,049 --> 00:16:04,729
connection with you thought you were an

357
00:16:02,269 --> 00:16:08,088
internet troll but it turns out that you

358
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:09,320
were a real cannabis activists and we

359
00:16:08,089 --> 00:16:11,360
thank you for the work you did and

360
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:13,490
really you know our thoughts go out to

361
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,089
your family and friends that you left

362
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:16,700
behind

363
00:16:14,089 --> 00:16:18,740
never good passing away and leaving

364
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:21,770
people behind that's kind of sad but it

365
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:24,680
is the sort of circle of life as we say

366
00:16:21,769 --> 00:16:27,980
so let's load it up for Mickey

367
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:29,509
r.i.p Mickey I was kind of scared of him

368
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:31,190
I'm not gonna lie I was kind of like I

369
00:16:29,509 --> 00:16:33,319
hope I don't get on this guy's radar and

370
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:35,860
have him start trolling me incessantly

371
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,860
but

372
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:42,920
I've attracted a few good ones over the

373
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:46,409
year yes rest well Mickey Abraham

374
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:48,599

375
00:16:46,409 --> 00:16:50,850
the matrix yeah we're gonna do a bong

376
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:53,070

his way to help people like that and

383
00:17:06,269 --> 00:17:11,369

cannabis world very very knowledgeable

454
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:03,209

yes trichome City we are looking for

457
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:10,079
that kind of help I'll probably grab a

458
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:11,940
couple of interns through interviews

459
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:13,980
gonna have to be able to trust them but

460
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:17,130
to be able to have them also come and do

461
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:18,660
work under Ron and myself you know

462
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:20,400
whether it's helping with editing

463
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:23,160
helping with filming helping with

464
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,060
growing helping with hash making helping

465
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:26,340
with a whole bunch of different things

466
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:28,169
like that obviously people who are local

467
00:21:26,339 --> 00:21:29,939
are ideal because it's an intern

468
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:31,769
position we're not looking to you know

469
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:34,110
right away be paying out of the gate

470
00:21:31,769 --> 00:21:36,660
we're definitely not looking to tell

471
00:21:34,109 --> 00:21:38,909
people to move from other countries and

472
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:40,800
far away to come here with the hopes

473
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:43,350
that this will be a job that opens up

474
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:45,990
their future and we don't want that

475
00:21:43,349 --> 00:21:48,509
responsibility but a couple of ships

476
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:50,220
will be there for sure for people who

477
00:21:48,509 --> 00:21:51,809
are local for people who live here who

478
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:53,880
have their support system here and for

479
00:21:51,809 --> 00:21:55,619
people we know aren't gonna have to

480
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:59,060
bugger off back to home after three or

481
00:21:55,619 --> 00:22:01,769
four weeks if things don't go proper

482

00:22:04,529 --> 00:22:10,079
gonna lie I'm I'm really excited at the

485
00:22:07,589 --> 00:22:12,659
idea of just having Ron back in my life

486
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:14,599
he lived so far away ten ten hours away

487
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:16,610

524
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:37,429
that you could control the flowering the

525
00:23:34,669 --> 00:23:39,410
photo period by simply making it dark or

526
