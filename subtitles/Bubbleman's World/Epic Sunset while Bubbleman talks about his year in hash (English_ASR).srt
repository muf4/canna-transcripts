really pushing the boundaries of water

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,320
extraction and dry sifting I've seen a

15
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:58,479
huge growth in the last just year even

16
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,840
um I even have to thank you know Believe

It or Not BHO you know all these people

18
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:07,118
that have come to learn about cannabis

19
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:08,679
through BHO are now finding themselves

20
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:11,319
looking for something else they're

21
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,640
looking for that next thing and you know

22
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:14,399
while a certain amount of those people

23
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,799
will stay with the BHO when they'll

24
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,320
specialize upon it and they'll become

25
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,439
you know the the people at the top of

26
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:23,758
that game the majority of people aren't

27
00:01:20,438 --> 00:01:25,359
accessing really clean good quality oils

28
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,159
um it's dangerous people are getting

29
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:30,840
injured so it's really nice to see a lot

30
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:33,680
of people um coming around and

31
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,560
just seeing that that dry sifting and

32
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:39,079
wet washing can produce equally as

33
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,399
dabbable of a product as you uh often

exciting year for Bubble

55
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:54,000
Bags um with the with the growth of

56
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:56,158
water extraction over the last few years

57
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
um Bubble Bags

58
00:02:56,158 --> 00:03:02,598

markets um welcome in how we produce and

60
00:03:02,598 --> 00:03:10,598
sell bags we've I guess what Bubble Bags

61
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:12,839
has done is we've um listened to the

62
00:03:10,598 --> 00:03:14,318
marketplace we understand that the

63
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,200
high-end Bubble Bags will always have

64
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:18,798
their place but we also this year

65
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:20,798
decided to come out with a more

66
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:23,280
inexpensive version of the Bubble Bags

67
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:25,840
uh the bubble bag lights you may have

68
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,878
seen the video on Urban Remo's channel

69
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,360
the urban grower on his YouTube channel

70
00:03:27,878 --> 00:03:32,598
of us making bubble together with the

71
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:35,200
lights or um John Bell and I making

72
00:03:32,598 --> 00:03:37,759
bubble together uh using the bubble bag

73
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:40,000
lights with his whole uh fresh frozen

74
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,598
plants those are all on on the channel

75
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,759
you can check them out if you haven't

76
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:45,039
already so that's really been great and

77
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:50,359
and another thing that's been really

78
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:55,000
great is the act absolute explosion of

79
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:57,720
of dry sifting you know for the longest

80
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,318
time I just didn't see a lot of dry sift

81
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:01,318
and it seemed everywhere I turned this

82
00:03:59,318 --> 00:04:02,878
year from being at when I asked everyone

83
00:04:01,318 --> 00:04:05,238
at the Cannabis Cup this year if anyone

84
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:07,039
had full m dry sift I saw many hands go

85
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:09,878
up in the crowd which was a huge jump

86
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:12,199
from last year's none so that's really

87
00:04:09,878 --> 00:04:13,598
great um sharing this information over

88
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:15,478
the course of the last few years

89
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:18,319
teaching people how to do the carting

90
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:21,600
techniques um you know showing people

91
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:23,879
how to gently and lightly extract heads

92
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,240
versus uh a rough extraction and a

93
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:29,159
cleaning they both have their place it's

94
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:32,038
just been great um saw some absolute

95
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:34,479
beautiful full 99% gland head hash

96
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:36,038
probably by at least half a dozen people

97
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:38,839
at the Cannabis Cup this year so that

98
00:04:36,038 --> 00:04:42,399
was really uh really great to

99
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:47,000
see and uh my own friends you know John

100
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:49,599
B um d420 K on Instagram he's been

101
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,360
making some really beautiful beautiful

102
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,800
hash some dry sifting we'll have a video

103
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,759
uh coming up with him in the next uh

104
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,360
month or two I'm not sure if I'm going

105
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:59,560
to be making it up to his neck of the

106
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,720
woods or if he's going to be coming down

107
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,759
down here but we're definitely going to

108
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,240
get together uh we're going to do some

109
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:05,800
dry sifting we're going to talk about

110
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,600
techniques we're going to you know show

111
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:10,000
some macro photography and get you guys

112
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:13,360
get you guys inspired to make this this

113
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:17,038
full melt wet wash and dry sift you know

114
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:19,319
these 99% pure gland heads that were

115
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:21,079
grown properly allowed to mature and

116
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:23,960
because of it you get that melty

117
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:28,279
dabbable product does it dab does it

118
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:30,879
melt the Purity is only half if that the

119
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:34,839
real trick is the quality plus the

120
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:34,839
Purity then you get something worth

121
00:05:43,129 --> 00:05:46,230
[Music]

122
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:04,519
smoking well favorite products of

123
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:05,879
2013 let me see most of them are sitting

124
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:09,198
here with me right

125
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:11,439
now this Mothership bong I can't

126
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:14,160
remember being this happy with a pipe in

127
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:16,199
a long time it was also the first time I

128
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,919
actually bought a pipe in a long time I

129
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:20,280
almost forgot people have been giving me

130
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:22,198
pipes for so long and I've always

131
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:24,439
appreciated it but it's like the

132
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:26,038
conversation I had with Brian from denil

133
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:28,918
another product that I've absolutely

134
00:06:26,038 --> 00:06:31,639
loved this year one of my favorites is

135
00:06:28,918 --> 00:06:34,120
that I prefer to feel the sting of

136
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:37,680
buying a product so I can actually judge

137
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:39,840
it accurately and really feel that

138
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,240
that's something I like based upon the

139
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:44,839
money that I I put out it's a big deal

140
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:48,439
it's it's easy to get given a product

141
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:50,959
and have that skew your perspective on

142
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:53,759
how much you actually like it because

143
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:55,519
often when we pay for things the earning

144
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,479
of money and the spending of the money

145
00:06:55,519 --> 00:07:01,560
we like to compare the value versus that

146
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:04,439
money so we'll buy something for $1,000

147
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:06,439
when we using it we'll think was that

148
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:08,639
$1,000 worth of whatever that product

149
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:10,079
was that I got no matter the product

150
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,879
people do it inevitably whether they

151
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:14,359
admit it or not and I I just felt for

152
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:16,319
the money that I spent on the denail

153
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:18,639
which was well below

154
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:21,199
$1,000 I've just been really happy with

155
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,478
it it we took it to the Cannabis Cup it

156
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:27,160
performed exceptional I love that I can

157
00:07:23,478 --> 00:07:30,478
use it um on a pipe and I can move it

158
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:31,919
freely uh this piece here is light

159
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:34,680
sometimes it gets a little bit twisted

160
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:38,279
which is simply untwisted by just

161
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:40,199
twisting because the cord is so light

162
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:42,159
you can actually do it I find that the

163
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:45,759
cord doesn't get caught on things I I

164
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:47,879
find that it's not um pulling things off

165
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,598
of my table if I have it up on the table

166
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:51,919
it's not knocking over jars of hash and

167
00:07:50,598 --> 00:07:56,360
that's one of the things I really like

168
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:59,740
about this unit I could go on for uh for

169
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:01,680
for a long time about uh the efficiency

170
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:04,158
[Music]

171
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:08,319
it's something to say that since I got

172
00:08:04,158 --> 00:08:10,800
this unit I think I may have lit a beine

173
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:13,319
like twice and each time I did it it was

174
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:16,800
just less enjoyable I've just gained

175
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:18,639
I've gotten used to this sort of hit um

176
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,478
also a product that's not here that I

177
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,960
want to give a mention to which is

178
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:24,120
really the first product that I got

179
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:27,079
turned on to this year that gave me

180
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,800
similar Bubble Hits to this but on an

181
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:31,519
even different level because this

182
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:34,839
product you can use cannabis combined

183
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:35,958
with bubble or either or and that would

184
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:38,479
be the

185
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:40,918
sublimator I know I've uh posted a few

186
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:44,080
videos of it before it is a bigger more

187
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:46,720
Awkward unit I think it's best suited

188
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,160
right now to be brought you go to the

189
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,680
sublimator it's not something you want

190
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:52,559
to pass around and you have to sometimes

191
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:54,479
explain to people that it's hot not to

192
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:55,639
touch much like the Dil I like to tell

193
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,560
people this is very hot and you

194
00:08:55,639 --> 00:09:00,720
shouldn't touch it and so um with doing

195
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:02,399
those two simple things you can really

196
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,120
uh share quite an experience with

197
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,958
someone and give them a nice sublimator

198
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:08,000
rip because to this day I got to give it

199
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:11,958
up to the sublimator for being one of

200
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,919
the tastiest hits I've ever taken hands

201
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:17,838
down John B would agree with me CU it

202
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:19,838
was his uh cush as we were puffing I

203
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,680
think he had finger rub and he even one

204
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:25,000
day brought over fresh cut herb that we

205
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:28,078
hit through the sublimator and it even

206
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,159
tasted amazing so it's quite something

207
00:09:28,078 --> 00:09:33,399
to check out um um you can check them

208
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:36,559
out uh at sublimator tocom I believe if

209
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:38,320
not we definitely also carry them uh on

210
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:41,639
Fresh hey.com

211
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:44,320
uh we also carry the denail we however

212
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:47,240
do not carry the motherships but you can

213
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:50,360
check out high integrity glass art uh on

214
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:52,159
Facebook or Instagram for these bad boys

215
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:54,159
I know they specialize uh in the

216
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:55,679
province of British Columbia but they

217
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:56,958
may or may not be able to sell you a

218
00:09:55,679 --> 00:10:00,199
piece if you're outside of British

219
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:02,479
Columbia you can check it out with them

220
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,079
um another little product I mean I don't

221
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,560
mention too often but you see me always

222
00:10:04,078 --> 00:10:09,000
using are the skillet tools I've seen a

223
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:11,879
few come and go since Skillet tool has

224
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,480
been around and I still am a favorite of

225
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:16,278
the skillet tool I love the bucket on

226
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,639
the the scooper I think it's just

227
00:10:16,278 --> 00:10:20,480
perfect for dry sift and bubble and the

228
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:22,838
little corner piece the little Dabber on

229
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,879
the other end it's perfect as well it's

230
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:28,560
just I can dab my my bubble with it I

231
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:29,879
can scoop my powder granul stuff with it

232
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:32,559
and I just think it's a really uh

233
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:36,519
allaround great product and one that I

234
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:39,199
use every day I obviously actually use

235
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:41,200
all of these products every day and of

236
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:45,879
course my favorite is the one that my

237
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:48,720
product makes bubble hash yeah 99% pure

238
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:51,240
gland heads extracted with the help the

239
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,600
water and the ice are doing everything

240
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:55,480
for you so as long as you follow simple

241
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,120
instructions and allow them to isolate

242
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:00,200
the gland heads for

243
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:04,240
you it's a no-brainer

244
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:08,639
you can ex expect to have some of the

245
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:12,759
purest gland head hash you've ever seen

246
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:17,000
water and ice made that possible pre

247
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:18,919
9798 um which is when the world really

248
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,159
learned about water extraction and I say

249
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:22,958
that in a public manner many people knew

250
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:26,439
about it decades

251
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:29,518
earlier but more the information was

252
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:31,279
more uh um isolated

253
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,360
now the information with the Internet is

254
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:37,480
more it's almost everywhere so many

255
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:39,320
people know about it and so um that

256
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:41,839
really changed the game to allow people

257
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:43,920
to have something at this level I I

258
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:44,959
remember it specifically because really

259
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:47,399
before

260
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:49,399
1999 which was when Bubble Bags came out

261
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:52,240
and really popularized the method we

262
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:54,958
really threw overgrow and the timing and

263
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,959
digital cameras and everything just kind

264
00:11:54,958 --> 00:12:01,759
of clicked and it became

265
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:03,638
that it became you know it was the time

266
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:05,360
for that information to spark and for

267
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:07,879
people to grab it I know I hear a lot of

268
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,839
people now saying that it's it's really

269
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:12,838
happening now because that's exponential

270
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:17,320
from what all the work that was done in

271
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:21,560
the late 90s to to you know to 2005 and

272
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:23,278
then 2005 to 2010 and 200 each time each

273
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:25,078
you know four or five years it's this

274
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:27,639
exponential growth and it's seemingly

275
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:30,278
been like that for almost since its

276
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:32,039
Inception so look very forward to see

277
00:12:30,278 --> 00:12:35,240
where water extraction as well as dry

278
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:36,719
sifting will take us in the 2014 year I

279
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,440
look forward to sharing a lot of cool

280
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,278
videos with you I've got ideas of

281
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,720
potentially going to Jamaica potentially

282
00:12:40,278 --> 00:12:44,399
going to Nepal

283
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:47,000
CMU um of course this winter we want to

284
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:50,159
do an ice cave session take you guys out

285
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,919
to the pton ice caps by snowmobile and

286
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:54,838
maybe make some dry sift and some wet

287
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:56,879
wash in an ice cave you know stay

288
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:58,480
overnight do some time- lapse

289
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:00,439
photography of the stars and put

290
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,639
together an nice video for you guys I

291
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:05,800
hope you guys have been enjoying this um

292
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:08,839
