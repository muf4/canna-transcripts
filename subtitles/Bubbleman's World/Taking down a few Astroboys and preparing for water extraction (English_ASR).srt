00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,198
hey guys welcome to Bubble man's world

3
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:26,719
uh it's been a bit since I actually

4
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:28,960
mentioned anything about my garden I'm

5
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:33,878
uh just in the middle of chopping down a

6
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:35,520
little Astro Boy so the Astro Boy here

7
00:00:33,878 --> 00:00:37,479
give you an idea of the quality of this

8
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:41,399
nugget is quite

9
00:00:37,479 --> 00:00:43,119
nice very very nice nugget um it's been

10
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:46,558
growing for N9

11
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:50,000
weeks really nice smelling as Astro Boy

12
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:52,119
always is I've got my screen out I've

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,799
got one nugget already here trimmed

14
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:58,000
lovely I've also trimmed about a plant's

15
00:00:54,799 --> 00:01:01,878
worth here and I've got another

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,280
plant and a bit right here so just sort

17
00:01:01,878 --> 00:01:08,319
of wanted to go over the quickness of

18
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:10,359
how I prepare um my plants for washing

19
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:12,359
of course usually I cut them down fresh

20
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:14,159
do a fresh frozen these have actually

21
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:16,118
been hanging for a few days and I do

22
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,560
notice already just a little bit of a

23
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:22,438
difference even in how the resin feels

24
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:26,159
to touch so I basically just do a quick

25
00:01:22,438 --> 00:01:28,478
snippety snip and remove fan leaves you

26
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,280
know when you're washing the resin off

27
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:32,879
of the plant you want the resin to stay

28
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,239
on there you don't want to cut it off

29
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:37,839
like the way you would uh you know for

30
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:39,199
if you were smoking just the buds I

31
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,520
understand that you want to remove all

32
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,359
that plant matter as possible I just

33
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:45,959
take it a step further and I say leave

34
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:47,680
all the plant matter so you can take it

35
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:51,359
all off with the

36
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,920
bags so boom

37
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:54,640
boom

38
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,799
boom

39
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,840
boom

40
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,520
boom and a

41
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:03,399
boom

42
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:03,399
and about three more

43
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:09,840
booms just getting them right down to

44
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,919
nice manageable size

45
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,239
buds this will make for an easier

46
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:17,518
extraction now I also Sav the stock the

47
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:21,878
Stock's completely sticky and covered in

48
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:24,400
lemon lemon type smelling um tpin those

49
00:02:21,878 --> 00:02:27,679
tpin are inside glandular triome heads

50
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,560
so why would we get rid of them so I'll

51
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,319
actually do um this is of course not

52
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:34,920
going to be a first run by any means

53
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:38,000
this is fan leaves and stock everything

54
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:41,199
in here will be just butt and then I

55
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,280
have a small pile of uh just the small

56
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:46,000
trim Leaf but I I don't get very much of

57
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,840
it because mostly I leave it all on for

58
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,598
the bud

59
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:55,959
run so this is the Astro Boy I had uh I

60
00:02:52,598 --> 00:02:58,759
think I have three four plants of the

61
00:02:55,959 --> 00:03:02,680
Astro Boy total this crop uh downstairs

62
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:06,399
in the tent I still have medic Kush My

63
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:09,000
Little Pony an

64
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:12,920
Afghan and I believe a

65
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,360
Hos number 10 hos number 10 from Mr

66
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:19,119
Burell so that's all exciting I kind of

67
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:21,760
uh I should probably leave those medy

68
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:25,439
kushes or medy hazes and the My Little

69
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:27,519
Ponies um however it is getting to a

70
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:30,318
point where I have to go away again I do

71
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:33,039
have N9 to 10 plants already prepped and

72
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:36,438
ready for the plant uh for the for the

73
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:38,598
tent and one of those is actually uh a

74
00:03:36,438 --> 00:03:39,759
couple of them actually are the jamaan

75
00:03:38,598 --> 00:03:43,238
so I'm

76
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:47,759
fairly interested in getting those out

77
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:50,680
so I may very well chop the medy haze

78
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:52,399
and the My Little Pony Even though it I

79
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,200
guess it's probably potentially about a

80
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,280
week to two weeks what you would

81
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:59,158
consider early for that particular

82
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,239
strain um I only have a few plants I'm

83
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:01,878
going to be running running them for

84
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,878
hash anyway and like I've mentioned

85
00:04:01,878 --> 00:04:05,679
before that you know sometimes you can

86
00:04:03,878 --> 00:04:08,359
affect the profile by cutting it early

87
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:11,239
or late and it's not necessarily a

88
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:12,959
negative uh effect so sometimes you want

89
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:14,719
to try it this is going to be one of

90
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,160
those trimes that I believe I'm going to

91
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:20,238
try it so I'll keep you guys informed as

92
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:22,720
to what goes on with

93
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:25,758
that and uh yeah I'll also keep you guys

94
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,600
informed with what goes in exactly to

95
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,120
the tent cuz I had it written down

96
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,360
somewhere I don't see my book anywhere

97
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,959
but I had written down all the different

98
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,840
strains that I have ready right now and

99
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:36,038
there's about nine or 10 of them and I

100
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:38,399
I'm not sure if there's an East Coast

101
00:04:36,038 --> 00:04:40,918
Sour Diesel in there and a congales and

102
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:42,758
some Jamaicans and maybe even a northern

103
00:04:40,918 --> 00:04:44,319
lights but it's a nice selection

104
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:47,280
nonetheless it's not everything I have

105
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:50,959
obviously just nine plants ready to go

106
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:51,879
so we'll uh keep you informed of that as

107
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:55,120
it

108
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:58,360
happens and once again this plant uh was

109
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:01,079
flushed for four jeez about five five of

110
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:02,120
the nine weeks that it was growing I

111
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:05,319
just

112
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:08,280
decided pretty much less than a month in

113
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:11,719
even to just start watering it and the

114
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:13,959
plant never really turned yellow so it's

115
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:16,080
quite

116
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:21,198
nice that medy

117
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:24,318
one OG flavors simple very simple simple

118
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:26,639
feeding product one part uh it's very

119
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:29,879
low in PH so when you when you dump it

120
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:33,639
into an eight or a 7 pH water uh you're

121
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:37,038
looking down at 3 to 3.5 so a little bit

122
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:42,000
of pH to bring it back up to that 6.2 to

123
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:43,719
6.8 perfect sort of cannabis friendly pH

124
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,038
and that's how this was grown basically

125
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:51,080
in that tent under 2600 wet light

126
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:54,879
bulbs uh Nano Lux were the

127
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:56,519
ballasts secret jardan were the tents so

128
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:58,639
yeah I'm really really quite happy with

129
00:05:56,519 --> 00:06:02,159
how it all turned out especially for a

130
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,720
summer crop um Summer's always harder as

131
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,400
you guys know the bugs like to move in

132
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:08,080
in summer uh you can get heat issues you

133
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:10,679
can get me DS you can get all these

134
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:13,120
different things um aside from the

135
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,840
smallest smallest amount uh I saw a

136
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,240
little bit of white flies uh just on the

137
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:24,038
bottom and I

138
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:26,199
just just had the hint of a might or two

139
00:06:24,038 --> 00:06:28,279
so I'm really glad that I safer soap

140
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:30,280
these before I put them into flour uh

141
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:33,000
knowing that summertime these bugs just

142
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:34,679
come out of nowhere and so that was good

143
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,319
I'm looking forward to cleaning the tent

144
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:41,478
right out once I cut those medy hazes

145
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:44,639
and my little ponies down as well as the

146
00:06:41,478 --> 00:06:46,758
hos and The Afghani The Afghani looks so

147
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,720
good and I'm telling you it

148
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:52,520
smells almost identical to Old School

149
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:54,000
Romulan Romulan from Romulan Joe back in

150
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:56,159
the days of the Compassion Club you know

151
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,199
I hear so many people talk about that

152
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,360
strain and I don't remember any of them

153
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:02,680
being around back then I used to get the

154
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:05,000
herb from Joe himself I would trade him

155
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,519
my own Dutch Treat that I was growing

156
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,519
for the club I would trade him an ounce

157
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:12,240
or 2 ounces for an ounce or 2 ounces of

158
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:14,878
his herb and I remember that Romulan

159
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:18,800
very very well I've been looking for it

160
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:21,520
for a long time I am really really under

161
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,598
the belief now after getting the uh The

162
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:26,758
Afghani from the great Gardener that the

163
00:07:23,598 --> 00:07:29,878
Romulan if it wasn't that Afghan it was

164
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:31,879
definitely an afghan that Pine py

165
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:34,720
incredibly piny taste that the uh

166
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:37,919

he acquired it and uh you know to follow

171
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,759
it back as far as possible obviously

172
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,360

extract even though it's lower quality I

207

can still offer it uh to friends to

208
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:36,880
myself uh when I don't want to eat a

209
