that OG Kush standard sour dream I'm

52
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:55,480
guessing a sour cross with blue dream

53
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:57,518
and then a granddaddy perss up on top

54
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:59,238
there so we'll be trying these out later

55
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,879
guys we'll get the microscope out and

56
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:02,840
photograph and we're also hoping on

57
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:04,919
making some bubble with those uh not

58
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,560
obviously these single little buds but

59
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:08,598
with some serious amounts actually what

60
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,439
we could do with each of these is we

61
00:03:08,598 --> 00:03:12,399
could do the parchment the rosin

62
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:14,199
technique sure right we could Tony's

63
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,200
going to be bringing the um hair

64
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:18,318
straightener and the parchment paper so

65
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:19,639
maybe we'll give a get a couple of Dabs

66
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:21,679
out of each of these buds I don't even

67
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:23,359
know what the uh what the returns are

68
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:27,519
but I I suspect there must be a dab or

69
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,760
so or two in each bud so right on

70
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:33,039
there's

71
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:33,039
that liking this

72
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,480
hash can see cuz we have the overhead

73
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:51,158

leave it on too long when we have it

78
