42
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:07,118
exactly Darren's

43
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,360
around big dabs will

44
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:11,239
flow nice you put the little cheese

45
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,440
plate with the berries and the fruit on

46
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:16,319
the table too well I like to have a

47
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:18,079
snack when we're uh in between Puffs

48
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:19,839
right cleanse the

49
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,120
pallet

50
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,878
true just give the nail a little bit of

51
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:27,280
a

52
00:02:23,878 --> 00:02:27,280
cleansing here we

53
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:31,759
go

54
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:50,480
nice man the Melt Factor on that's

55
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:54,359
incredible it just boils

56
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:54,359
eh it's exactly what it

57
00:02:54,519 --> 00:03:00,400
does very fine fine amount of uh of

58
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:02,120
residue which of course will be

59
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,158
um when when you're dealing with hash

60
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,239
and not

61
00:03:03,158 --> 00:03:07,679
Oil we're always going to be left over

62
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:10,560
with that tiny little bit of wax

63
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,159
membrane don't be alarmed let it smoke

64
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,120
off and then just blow it off the nail

65
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:16,878
it's not something you need to be uh

66
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:19,080
feeling that you have to

67
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:22,919
inhale the first part of the hit at

68
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:26,599
first 90% is just so good that's that's

69
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:28,958
what I I love doing

70
00:03:26,598 --> 00:03:32,280
the you got all sorts of nice treats in

71
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:34,120
the House eh yeah well this is uh what i

72
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,479
g what I gave you there and this is some

73
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,759
stuff that's that's cured up since the

74
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:42,199
last time you were up oh yeah that's

75
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:44,479
been curing since then and it's uh in

76
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:47,119
the glass jar you know it's Whited out

77
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:49,479
you know it's done that thing but you uh

78
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,360
showed me the method there one of your

79
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:53,000
videos there on how to get it gooey

80
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,000
again absolutely pretty pretty

81
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,680
straightforward and Y and uh works well

82
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,199
but I you know for myself if I'm if I'm

83
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,000
dabbing it like that I like like to have

84
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:05,000
that consistency but it sure is

85
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,400
interesting how like how the resin can

86
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,400
pull moisture oh man like especially

87
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,560
when it's left open for any amount of

88
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,280
time yeah especially coming down here

89
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,720
yeah like it's uh it their presses up

90
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:20,759
nice though yeah well this stuff is uh

91
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:23,639
is new I made this last week it was just

92
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:26,240
sifting I was sifting literally well two

93
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:30,519
hours before we left on the trip my my

94
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:32,519
uh my bro chance from Iron heads he uh

95
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:34,198
he come down and picked me up so I was

96
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:36,319
sifting about two hours before that just

97
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:37,360
finishing up putting that stuff in there

98
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:38,959
well we're going to definitely send you

99
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,520
back with some new screens we got the

100
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:43,279
250 Micron and the 180 Micron yes I'm

101
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:45,079
very excited for that the quick little

102
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:47,519
trick you know you just this is a real

103
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:49,519
quick trick with the 250 to the 180 you

104
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:51,639
can throw your material over it very

105
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:54,159
gently lift up the two screens and you

106
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:56,360
should have a very clean high percentage

107
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,280
of gland heads I mean you know nothing

108
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:01,080
compared to how much uh Darren's making

109
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:03,239
on on a regular basis using carding

110
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:05,038
techniques but I look forward to hearing

111
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,639
about what he comes up with with the two

112
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:09,199
extra screen sizes and how he starts

113
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,160
playing with them same here um I I like

114
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,160
it I find the different like what I got

115
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:16,919
here is two different screen sizes one's

116
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:19,600
the uh 70 Micron or 73 one's the 107

117
00:05:16,918 --> 00:05:22,359
one's the 107 and uh I like the 107 I

118
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:25,840
like the 107 a lot the I've even caught

119
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:27,840
it on the um 120 I've even got heads off

120
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:30,038
that and they're so fat you look at them

121
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:32,719
under the microscope and you take a to

122
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:35,279
of that and you yeah no it's definitely

123
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,600
interesting how uh you can separate the

124
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:38,478
different profiles and the different

125
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:41,800
effects via just the size of the

126
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:43,758
glandular Tricom heads I mix both the

127
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,520
the the grades just cuz I'm a bit of a

128
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,840
pig that way you got a nice big fat dab

129
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:50,318
there yeah I'll be able to talk for 15

130
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:51,879
minutes while he's hitting that cheers

131
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:53,080
so we're basically going to do a few

132
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:54,839
different things today we want to take

133
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:56,800
you guys for a little bit of a SE to sky

134
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:59,198
highway motorcycle ride we've got the

135
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:02,478
GoPros mounted on the Harley's so we'll

136
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:04,478
do a a little bit of that um we want to

137
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:06,719
get out on the boat and take you guys

138
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:08,879
out on the house sound a little bit just

139
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,880
float around maybe bring the denail or a

140
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:14,079
pure hash joint and chill out for 15 or

141
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:16,360
20 minutes with you guys out on the boat

142
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:19,399
and then we will also potentially go

143
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:21,520
into the city today and maybe we'll see

144
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:24,038
if Mega ill is open see what they're

145
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:25,918
saying if not we'll find another spot

146
00:06:24,038 --> 00:06:28,439
where we can go potentially have a

147
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:31,639
session down at the uh cchq or one of

148
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:33,160
the dispens yes sir yes sir so we got a

149
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:34,478
full day planned with you guys here

150
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:37,160
we're definitely going to do a whack of

151
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:39,519
cool stuff I'm super looking forward to

152
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,880
getting on the Harley I can't even tell

153

the bike I had purchased it for him for

164
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:14,199
his 50th birthday and he by the time he

165
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:15,719
was 55 him and his wife uh hid a deer

166
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:17,879
and they were going quite fast on the

167
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:22,000
highway and all that were involved

168
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:24,479
perished so I fixed up the bike and it's

169
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,800
sort of how I visit with my dad so I

170
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:27,279
haven't been thinking about him quite as

171
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,199
much lately it's been nine years since

172
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:32,119
his passing as well as his wife so

173
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:34,000
it'll be another day for me to sort of

174
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,399
awesome connecting it's an awesome way

175
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,360
to connect for sure so while we're

176
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:41,878
cruising around you you know that I'm in

177
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:43,800
my head talking to my dad and his wife

178
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:47,560
so looking forward to that too it's a

179
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:50,720
beautiful day for it it's a beautiful

180
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:52,319
day and we're surrounded by cannabis

181
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,319
what do we got here we got that's the

182
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,158
Jamaican seedling that's 7 and 1/2 weeks

183
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,360
old was it Lamb's breath that was the

184
00:07:56,158 --> 00:08:00,360
Lamb's bread the bread of the Lamb yeah

185
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:03,800
the bread of the Lamb um then we have

186
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:08,598
John's medic Kush John Bell Sharon is

187
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:10,759
medicine good guy John Remo the urban

188
00:08:08,598 --> 00:08:13,120
grower has shared his medicine of course

189
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:17,720
as well this is the UBC

190
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:21,598
chemo and then uh this is the first

191
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:24,720
cut from the Jamaican and it's already

192
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:27,038
rooted and happily growing and in fact

193
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:30,120
you can see that it's missing a top and

194
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:33,598
that top is in my cloner and it's

195
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:37,479
red so I already have a clone from the

196
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:39,320
seedling cloned nice so I'm ready to

197
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:41,839
start sharing the jamaic see what it see

198
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:43,800
what it looks like when it's in full bud

199
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,240
yeah exactly it freeze your face or

200
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:47,599
something you're telling me like yeah

201
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:50,879
totally numbed out my mouth that was 20

202
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:54,519
years ago it was in 1995 so 19 and a

203
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:56,559
half years ago right wow January

204
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:58,519
February March April May June July

205
00:08:56,559 --> 00:09:02,119
October November like substantially like

206
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:03,879
about 19 .2 years ago now there's the

207
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:06,480
now in that process how did you store

208
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:08,399
your seed was it in a special container

209
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,680
was it in a freezer in a fridge was it

210
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:13,399
just in a drawer yes all of the above

211
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:16,319
none of the last um I took care of it I

212
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:19,120
knew that keeping it cold was essential

213
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:22,760
so um for the longest time it was just

214
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,879
in a sealed plastic casing and then

215
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:28,559
inside you know a little container

216
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:30,159
inside um the fridge now after probably

217
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:33,000
several years years of being in the

218
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:36,679
fridge maybe upwards of 5 to

219
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,200
7 I put it in the freezer and now I

220
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:39,719
remember kind of being like I wasn't

221
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,879
sure if the freezer you you don't want

222
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,839
the freezer to get too cold you can't

223
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:45,838
have it like crystallize the embryo

224
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:48,640
right so I had it in a freezer that was

225
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:51,320
basically turned substantially down but

226
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:54,879
it still produced ice so it was

227
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:56,120
still excuse me no problem these rips

228
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:59,078
are

229
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:01,120
intense so I mean uh you know for most

230
00:09:59,078 --> 00:10:03,359
most of its 20 years it was in a freezer

231
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,639
for some of its you know for a third of

232
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,240
it it was in the fridge and I dare say

233
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:10,159
there was probably a year or two that it

234
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:11,720
was just at room temperature so which is

235
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:13,799
incredible cuz the last seat I brought

236
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:16,240
back from Jamaica at room temperature in

237
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:17,958
this warm weather cracked in my pocket

238
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,839
it was basically cracked before I put it

239
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:22,838
in paper towels so and that one's now

240
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:25,560
growing you've seen it it's almost 3 in

241
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:27,360
tall it it wanted to grow so we've got

242
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:29,439
all sorts of Life blooming forward from

243
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,079
these Jamaican trips of course just got

244
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,760
back from Jamaica I was there with John

245
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:35,239
and some other friends we were working

246
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:37,720
on some projects there that we'll

247
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:40,240
hopefully be able to talk to uh if they

248
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:43,200
pan out and if if the future allows us

249
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:47,120
to do so and so I'm back to Jamaica in

250
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,639
10 days back to Kingston so I'm glad uh

340
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:39,319
about water or do you want to hit this

341
00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:42,440
dry we can do it dry we can do it dry

342
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:45,079
yeah let's do a dry rip on our uh next

343
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:47,440
off we'll hit the uh we'll fill the

344
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:49,119
cooler up with Waters and ice so we have

345
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:52,000
water for nextra time it's not very

346
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:54,359
often that the focus isn't 100% THC but

347
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,759
when you get Darren and I on our bikes

348
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:59,359
THC just takes a back seat to getting

349
00:18:56,759 --> 00:19:01,558
onto the highway and I mean this highway

350
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:03,558
was built for riding for riding and our

351
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:04,960
bikes were built for this highway yeah

352
00:19:03,558 --> 00:19:06,519
it's supposed to we supposed to hit this

353
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,480
highway no matter what so it's a pretty

354
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:12,599
beautiful thing yeah so I grabbed some

355
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:16,640
dry sift off the uh off my desk

356
00:19:12,599 --> 00:19:18,519
there if you want to uh do the heating

357
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,038
upage of the no you know I'm never sure

358
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:22,079
on how long I heat this up for just heat

359
00:19:20,038 --> 00:19:24,038
it up till it kind of turns a little

360
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:25,918
orange you know make sure you can kind

361
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:28,000
of it is a bit tricky outside I'd say

362
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,440
hold it good and close like that kind of

363
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,558
on that one side away from the you know

364
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:34,360
like right where you're hitting it on

365
00:19:31,558 --> 00:19:35,918
that other side perfect right there just

366
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:39,158
kind of hold it up against the side

367
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:41,480
there and once it gets nice and hot

368
00:19:39,159 --> 00:19:44,039
we'll dab this little

369
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:45,279
dab so this is the Pacific Ocean behind

370
00:19:44,038 --> 00:19:47,359
us you've seen me out there the other

371
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:50,319
day on my boat we got killer

372
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:54,038
whales uh Pacific seals Pacific Whit

373
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:56,319
sided dolphins sea lions you know giant

374
00:19:54,038 --> 00:19:58,319
octopuses the whole nine yards the

375
00:19:56,319 --> 00:20:02,639
Pacific Ocean is definitely stocked with

376
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:05,038
epic ocean uh mammals and and uh fish

377
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,320
very cool you ready I think so let's

378
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:07,319
give it a

379
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:24,880
shot it was

380
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:26,480
ready pretty smooth for a dry hit too

381
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,679
nice nice those little Hitman baby cakes

382
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:32,000
look at that dry sip beautiful keep that

383
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:34,880

384
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
go of Goo a gooey goodness just in the

385

00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,319
to all right

387
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:44,439
so we're not sure exactly how far we're

388
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:46,279
set we're heading up we'll stop at

389
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:49,480
Shannon Falls and check out the

390
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:51,960
waterfall we'll uh maybe stop it in

391
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:53,798
Squamish and check out the new Gondola

392
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,600
um maybe we'll go past Squamish and go

393
00:20:53,798 --> 00:20:57,119
check out Alice Lake which side did you

394

going to relax here and enjoy the view

399
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:14,199
till we've uh feel the full feelings of

400
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:16,278
our medicine wearing off so we're safe

401

403
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:30,038
Whistler

404
00:21:37,558 --> 00:21:42,399

405
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,400
across over there

406
00:21:57,038 --> 00:22:00,038
Beach

turn it off hello okay we're here we got

409
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:11,038
to Shannon Falls this is uh one of the

410
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:13,240
Epic stops if you're heading from

411
00:27:11,038 --> 00:27:15,000
Vancouver to Whistler Shannon Falls is

412
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:17,000
generally a spot to stop at it's one of

413
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,159
our taller waterfalls even here in

414
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,599
Canada aside from maybe Niagara Falls

415
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:23,320
which is epically huge beautiful here

416
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:24,959
beautiful even seen it this this one's

417
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:26,319
pretty sweet the creek starts right here

418
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,960
it's literally right behind us there's

419
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:30,599
people there's a little creek and then

420
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:33,960
it's feeding out

421
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:35,798
from up in behind those trees up there

422
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:39,038
you kind of see it it's serious

423
00:27:35,798 --> 00:27:41,519
[ __ ] so I guess uh we're just

424
00:27:39,038 --> 00:27:42,839
going to walk up here right D [ __ ] yeah

425
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:44,960
did you want to go have a session at the

426
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:46,119
base of that thing or what sure why not

427
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,120
it's kind of what I'm feeling let's do

428
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:49,678
it it's kind of what I'm feeling drink

429
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:50,879
the water when we get there yeah and

430
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:52,399
fill the pipe up with water more

431
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,519
importantly I've stood Under The Falls

432
00:27:52,398 --> 00:27:56,119
it's pretty awesome I mean it's

433
00:27:54,519 --> 00:27:59,240
summertime now so the Falls won't be

434
00:27:56,119 --> 00:28:01,000
falling quite as uh you know they won't

435
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:03,640
be quite as Raging as they normally are

436
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,798
in the winter but um definitely it'll

437
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:08,240
still be a humbling experience to stand

438
00:28:05,798 --> 00:28:08,240
underneath

439
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:15,278
it yeah this is all new a lot of this

440
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:16,960
stuff this all is new to me so we can do

441
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:19,919
the trail we can walk in the trail so

442
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,919
there's the fall right

443
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,759
there I'm going to have to bring my

444
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,880
honey here yeah this is a good spot to

445
00:28:24,759 --> 00:28:28,079
bring the girls I've definitely brought

446
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:29,760
my wife here many of times well she'll

447
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:31,240
be my wife in it next month and then

448
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:33,240
this is also the beginning of the Stow

449
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:34,919
Miss Chief if you notice that giant rock

450
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:38,038
of granite as we rolled in around the

451
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:39,720
corner a huge chunk of granite that's

452
00:28:38,038 --> 00:28:41,440
called the chief and that's a pretty

453
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:45,640
epic

454
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,640
trail so I say we head in this

455
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:51,159
way there some Boulder hoppin some rock

456
00:28:48,798 --> 00:28:51,158
hopp

457
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:57,960
absolutely so this is all coming from

458
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:59,519
the waterfall feeding out

459
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:01,679
and going right down and feeding into

460
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:01,679
the

461
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:11,000
ocean and upper

462
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,398
everywhere that's awesome in

463
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:21,240
here so we'll have to climb up through

464
00:29:17,398 --> 00:29:23,518
the falls into the

465
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:25,558
uh might have to put the GoPro on for

466
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:27,599
that

467
00:29:25,558 --> 00:29:29,759
footage although I could probably hold

468
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,759
this

469
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:49,798

the old school Romulan that Romulan Joe

950
01:02:53,278 --> 01:02:57,318
used to have it's one of the first

951
01:02:54,599 --> 01:02:59,680
things that I've seen in a long time

952
01:02:57,318 --> 01:03:01,960
that had that smell and that

953
01:02:59,679 --> 01:03:05,118
taste oh yeah look did this guy go he's

954

955
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:08,599
Woody Dr Tomic said the same thing when

956
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:09,838
he was here the other day that's the

957
01:03:08,599 --> 01:03:11,920
only way to do it man and then many

958
01:03:09,838 --> 01:03:14,239
people said no that's not true which is

959
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:16,480
great cannabis is the dichotomous plant

960
01:03:14,239 --> 01:03:18,118
where you just have so much one guy says

961
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:19,838
one thing and it's like no the other guy

962
01:03:18,119 --> 01:03:22,119
swears against that one thing they're so

963
01:03:19,838 --> 01:03:24,400
resilient it's awesome it'll do anything

964
01:03:22,119 --> 01:03:25,838
it'll do the opposite it'll do the two

965
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:27,680
opposite things and then people like no

966
01:03:25,838 --> 01:03:29,078
I'm doing it right no I'm doing it right

967
01:03:27,679 --> 01:03:31,318
it's like dude you're both doing it

968
01:03:29,079 --> 01:03:34,318
right and simultaneously both doing it

969
01:03:31,318 --> 01:03:35,480
wrong so exactly Barb is right next to

970
01:03:34,318 --> 01:03:37,639
you

971
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:40,318
there the first two that he picked

972
01:03:37,639 --> 01:03:42,118
Afghani and Barb great to share I know

973
01:03:40,318 --> 01:03:44,599
the great Gardener is happy to share his

974
01:03:42,119 --> 01:03:46,119
genetics I mean most people are that are

975
01:03:44,599 --> 01:03:47,838
selling them because they sell the

976
01:03:46,119 --> 01:03:49,278
genetics so whether you're sharing them

977
01:03:47,838 --> 01:03:52,000
or not people are able to buy them and

978
01:03:49,278 --> 01:03:54,239
acquire them so both of these two the

979
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:56,278
Barb and The Afghani are purch

980
01:03:54,239 --> 01:03:57,719
purchasable in seed form via the

981

so loose at first I remember remember it

1020
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:59,559
being just like it was so weird it had a

1021
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:01,719
tall stock and then it had this like

1022
01:05:59,559 --> 01:06:03,559
Mass just right here and it was like

1023
01:06:01,719 --> 01:06:05,519
kind of falling over and loose and I was

1024

OG skunk and John was just like you

SI it looks all of his OG crosses have

1030
01:06:15,199 --> 01:06:19,000
been great so far I mean it's hard to

1031
01:06:16,719 --> 01:06:21,598
not like it's hard to hit something with

1032
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:23,559
OG and not come out with something

1033

Sizzle you can hear that Sizzle on the

1311
01:17:40,279 --> 01:17:45,198
camera bet there's no way you can't it

1312
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:49,119
just boils

1313
01:17:45,198 --> 01:17:51,079
oils it just goes then silence and a

1314
01:17:49,119 --> 01:17:53,000
clear dome for like a substantial amount

1315
01:17:51,079 --> 01:17:55,679
of time oh and then you get this rip

1316
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:57,840
that he's about to get followed by the

1317
01:17:55,679 --> 01:17:59,560
oh my God I can't believe the taste it's

1318
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:01,520
on my lips it's in my throat took the

1319

01:18:03,359 --> 01:18:07,599
right down like a [ __ ] blanket all

1322
01:18:05,039 --> 01:18:09,639
over every part you can taste the

1323
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:12,000
parentage and there's so much man I love

1324
01:18:09,639 --> 01:18:16,359
that and even if you're smoking OG out

1325
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:19,079
of that next you're still T an AST boy

1326
01:18:16,359 --> 01:18:21,238
after smoking OG which to me I've never

1327
01:18:19,079 --> 01:18:23,479
smoked anything that dominated over that

1328
01:18:21,238 --> 01:18:26,799
because had such a strong taste but C's

1329
01:18:23,479 --> 01:18:29,279
like the Congo just lingers man it

1330
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:31,480
really [ __ ] lingers was that for some

01:18:29,279 --> 01:18:31,479
[ __ ]

1332
01:18:33,439 --> 01:18:38,638
maneuverability that's aent yeah like I

1333
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:40,199
said this was found in my freezer so the

1334
01:18:38,639 --> 01:18:43,319
sizzle is more from the fact that

1335
01:18:40,198 --> 01:18:46,039
there's moisture still in it water but

1336

well Perfect Look at

1468
01:25:13,198 --> 01:25:17,759
that I think that we'll just won't have

1469
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:20,760
luck pushing the Jamaicans through here

1470
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:24,719
with roots on them

1471
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:28,280
oh I've taken has such big

1472
01:25:24,719 --> 01:25:31,039
cuts that uh I don't want to stress them

1473
01:25:28,279 --> 01:25:34,479
out any more than they need to

1474
01:25:31,039 --> 01:25:34,479
be so

1475
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:46,439
Jamaican darn

1476
01:25:48,639 --> 01:25:54,279
you all

1477
01:25:51,279 --> 01:25:54,279
right

1478
01:25:54,880 --> 01:26:00,359
Jamaican killer so that's four yeah and

1479
01:25:58,158 --> 01:26:01,479
you can go ahead and plop the Clones

1480
01:26:00,359 --> 01:26:03,439
that I gave you because they have tags

1481
01:26:01,479 --> 01:26:05,039
right on the cuts all right so now we're

1482
01:26:03,439 --> 01:26:07,759
going to do

1483
01:26:05,039 --> 01:26:09,479
these these can go right in here as you

1484
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:13,440
are correct because they have tags right

1485
01:26:09,479 --> 01:26:16,319
on the cuts how professional is that oh

1486
01:26:13,439 --> 01:26:18,000
running a a large a large license

1487
01:26:16,319 --> 01:26:19,759
breeding facility I don't even need this

1488
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:25,039
much I'm going to cut these down quite a

1489
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:27,560
bit I just did it in half a second you

1490
01:26:25,039 --> 01:26:31,760
lots to work with it's plenty to work

1491
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:33,880
with for sure that's very good so we'll

1492
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:36,360
give this

1493
01:26:33,880 --> 01:26:38,440
guy you know at least his inch and a

1494
01:26:36,359 --> 01:26:43,118
half to two Ines

1495
01:26:38,439 --> 01:26:43,118
below I'll probably trim this Leaf out a

1496
01:26:48,158 --> 01:26:54,198
little all

1497
01:26:51,198 --> 01:26:54,198
right

1498
01:26:59,399 --> 01:27:05,839
so that was the OG yeah that's the

1499
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:05,840
OG

1500
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:11,719
beautiful there's another one for you

1501
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:14,719
sir mhm stripped her a little bit on the

1502
01:27:11,719 --> 01:27:17,920
way out but all right she's

1503
01:27:14,719 --> 01:27:17,920
o she

1504
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:25,118
is I just really walk through the room

1505
01:27:22,639 --> 01:27:27,039
last night and uh it's basically like a

1506
01:27:25,118 --> 01:27:29,079
Jumanji jungle in there and tried to

1507
01:27:27,039 --> 01:27:31,399
figure out what nice what you would like

1508
01:27:29,079 --> 01:27:32,840
to have that's basically what well I got

1509
01:27:31,399 --> 01:27:34,439
to say all this seems like a real nice

1510
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:37,119
surprise I never talked to you about any

1511
01:27:34,439 --> 01:27:40,960
of this so I wasn't really expecting um

1512
01:27:37,118 --> 01:27:43,719
a big slurry of uh beautiful

1513
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:45,399
genetics now it seems as though since

1514
01:27:43,719 --> 01:27:48,719
I've been giving them away I have to

1515
01:27:45,399 --> 01:27:51,238
admit they are coming more readily like

1516
01:27:48,719 --> 01:27:52,719
this not just because people want but

1517
01:27:51,238 --> 01:27:56,839
people seem genuinely

1518
01:27:52,719 --> 01:27:58,639
to want to share of course man that's I

1519
01:27:56,840 --> 01:27:59,760
wouldn't be a breeder I wouldn't be a

1520
01:27:58,639 --> 01:28:01,760
medical

1521
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:04,199
breeder it would just go against

1522
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:05,760
everything that I'm about and and you

1523
01:28:04,198 --> 01:28:08,079
need to share that's why I started

1524
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:11,560
reading in the first place not to just

1525
01:28:08,079 --> 01:28:13,559
cure my own disease and illness was to

1526
01:28:11,560 --> 01:28:16,119
spread it onto other people and I've

1527
01:28:13,560 --> 01:28:18,080
done exactly that it's definitely the

1528
01:28:16,118 --> 01:28:20,559
righteous thing to

1529
01:28:18,079 --> 01:28:25,039
do it's definitely the righteous thing

1530
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:29,520
to do all right so that was Orga I

1531
01:28:25,039 --> 01:28:34,439
believe Ortega we did what two

1532
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:34,440
ogs yeah OG OG Orga

1533
01:28:42,359 --> 01:28:51,000
Orga you get them in there pretty good

1534
01:28:44,840 --> 01:28:54,000
bud I gots to admit you do you do oh

1535
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:54,000
yeah

1536
01:28:57,960 --> 01:29:02,359
these to be much longer than I normally

1537
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:04,560
do they're pretty big and Woody that's

1538
01:29:02,359 --> 01:29:07,708
that's okay though it's very

1539
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:07,709
[Music]

1540
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:12,639
good if you put them in the uh the auto

1541
01:29:10,920 --> 01:29:15,118

half a foot you don't talk oh yeah I

1543

01:29:23,639 --> 01:29:28,239
it's hard to deny it no you can try it's

1547
01:29:26,719 --> 01:29:30,000
just hard to flush if you're fully

01:33:11,880 --> 01:33:15,520
more that we're going to cut what do you

1629
01:33:13,238 --> 01:33:17,799
need there doc

1630
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:22,440
atomics okay

1631
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:23,800
uhoh oh good one that's a jammy perfect

1632
01:33:22,439 --> 01:33:26,279
and this is going to have roots oh

1633
01:33:23,800 --> 01:33:27,960
you're so lucky there's two that aren't

1634
01:33:26,279 --> 01:33:30,759
like all rooted out the roots are going

1635
01:33:27,960 --> 01:33:32,679
to get damaged sticking them in there so

1636
01:33:30,760 --> 01:33:34,480
this will be somewhat sensitive it'll

1637
01:33:32,679 --> 01:33:37,319
probably droop over I can see Roots

1638
01:33:34,479 --> 01:33:39,279
starting in this one there we go right

1639
01:33:37,319 --> 01:33:42,519
down to the Head it'll probably be a

1640
01:33:39,279 --> 01:33:42,519
little droopy but it'll be

1641
01:33:45,719 --> 01:33:50,319
fine it's just cuz it's been a while

1642
01:33:47,920 --> 01:33:52,359
since we turned the the cloner off now

1643
01:33:50,319 --> 01:33:55,920
the Clones are starting to

1644
01:33:52,359 --> 01:33:55,920
hopefully that will secure

1645
01:34:00,238 --> 01:34:04,839

01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:47,359
away is I'll probably cut here take a

1761
01:39:45,560 --> 01:39:48,960
cut and I'll get this will be a clone

1762
01:39:47,359 --> 01:39:51,118
and this will be a clone so I'll get two

1763
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:53,079
cuts off of it just this little top

1764

right here two cuts we'll go right into

1765
01:39:53,079 --> 01:39:56,399

the greenhouse behind the house here but

1884
01:44:47,399 --> 01:44:51,118
for now it's uh it's a decent facility

1885
01:44:49,679 --> 01:44:52,840
I'm happy with it I'm I'm able to grow

1886
01:44:51,118 --> 01:44:54,399
my mothers and my plants have a couple

1887
01:44:52,840 --> 01:44:57,079
of tents for

1888
01:44:54,399 --> 01:44:59,598
Blooming it is getting hard summertime

1889
01:44:57,079 --> 01:45:00,960
is is tough I don't have any special uh

1890
01:44:59,599 --> 01:45:03,760
air conditioning or anything like that

1891
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:06,279
so my tents get warm definitely going to

1892
01:45:03,760 --> 01:45:08,920
end up with uh with potential bug

1893
01:45:06,279 --> 01:45:11,279
problem if I don't uh you know cut the

1894
01:45:08,920 --> 01:45:13,000
crop down that's in there now it's fine

1895
01:45:11,279 --> 01:45:15,519
but the new tent is like I seen some

1896
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:16,840
white flies in there going to have to

1897
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:18,639
[ __ ] figure out what I'm going to do

1898
01:45:16,840 --> 01:45:20,679
there well you know the good thing is is

1899
01:45:18,639 --> 01:45:23,560
that you have enough that you can take

1900
01:45:20,679 --> 01:45:25,840
them out individually clean them up put

1901
01:45:23,560 --> 01:45:27,159
them back take them all out clean it up

1902
01:45:25,840 --> 01:45:28,599
in there like you don't have especially

1903
01:45:27,158 --> 01:45:29,839
the stuff that's not flowering yet and

1904
01:45:28,599 --> 01:45:32,599
you don't have to use anything with it

1905
01:45:29,840 --> 01:45:34,279
you could just rub all everything off

1906
01:45:32,599 --> 01:45:35,599
rub all the leaves everything like that

1907
01:45:34,279 --> 01:45:38,719
you really want to get down to it not

1908
01:45:35,599 --> 01:45:41,560
use your you any anything any Solution

1909
01:45:38,719 --> 01:45:43,639
on it yeah not in bud anyway pre-bd like

1910
01:45:41,560 --> 01:45:45,159
this I use safer soap yeah for sure give

1911
01:45:43,639 --> 01:45:46,400
them a couple shots of it a month and

1912
01:45:45,158 --> 01:45:48,238
just make sure everything's down that

1913
01:45:46,399 --> 01:45:50,519
way when people come and grab cuts from

1914
01:45:48,238 --> 01:45:52,399
me I'm secure in knowing that I'm not

1915
01:45:50,520 --> 01:45:54,560
giving them a bunch of bugs but my

1916
01:45:52,399 --> 01:45:56,359
mothers do hang out outside all day long

1917
01:45:54,560 --> 01:45:58,119
so you know the safer soap is going to

1918
01:45:56,359 --> 01:46:02,118
be essential especially with this hot

1919
01:45:58,118 --> 01:46:02,118
