00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:26,198
hey guys welcome to Bubble man's world

3
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:28,640
and welcome to Bubble man's room I am

4
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:30,880
visiting uh my family in Manitoba

5
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,759
Winnipeg Manitoba and this is actually

6
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:37,359
the room that I grew up in from around

7
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:40,239
12 years to around 17 16 17 before I

8
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:41,679
moved out so yeah this is my little room

9
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:42,919
there's not much to see really I'll kind

10
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:44,200
of give you guys a little tour once we

11
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:47,679
have a dab but what I thought would be

12
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:51,719
cool was to do a little dab in bubble

13
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:53,359
man's room so I got my dabs right here

14
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:54,920
nice variety I got a little headband

15
00:00:53,359 --> 00:01:00,160
left over

16
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:00,160
still we scoop up a little bit of that

17
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,920
oh yeah when the rosin is the right

18
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:08,840
texture it just cleans up so

19
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:11,359
perfectly all right so yeah this is

20
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:13,799
literally the room I lived in when I

21
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:15,478
started smoking cannabis and in fact

22
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:17,280
today not that it's that exciting but

23
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:19,359
it's part of my history I was thinking

24
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,439
of taking us down just down the street

25
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:24,359
where I smoked my first joint so I

26
00:01:22,438 --> 00:01:27,359
thought that would be kind of fun and in

27
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:31,000
the meantime I got the mother ship the

28
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:32,239
gold denail and we are ready

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,719
to

30
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:37,679
rock all right headband Rous and dabs

31
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:39,599
first dab I've ever taken in my room in

32
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,360
fact aside from maybe some hot knives

33
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:44,919
that I did years ago in my uh closet

34
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:46,359
here I didn't smoke very often in this

35
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:48,920
room because it's on the same floor as

36
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:52,159
my parents and uh it' be pretty pretty

37
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:53,519
easy to get caught so uh my mom's down

38
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,479
by the pool right now hopefully she

39
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:59,239
doesn't come up and catch us but for now

40
00:01:56,478 --> 00:02:00,399

48
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,959
passion for cannabis and it really

49
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:35,560
happened in this area in this home

50
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:38,120
another home that I used to live in with

51
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:40,759
my father and his uh wife as well as my

52
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,000
step sister and my step brother uh we

53
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:43,479

00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:53,158
joints uh in the back little shed always

58

when the family gets divorced you

62
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:02,878
usually uh especially if you're a

63
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,159
teenage boy you can get away with some

64

75
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:33,280
started here for bubble man at this home

76
00:03:30,438 --> 00:03:36,560
when I was uh about 14 years old smoked

77
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,000
my first joint down the road and uh well

78
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,158
I really never looked back after that

79
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,158
did

80
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:05,120
I all right let's give you guys the huge

81
00:04:01,318 --> 00:04:08,598
tour of this amazing

82
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:11,920
bedroom that's it look I've even got my

83
00:04:08,598 --> 00:04:14,679
old uh skateboard painting still

84
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:17,918
up and this is where uh you know the

85
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:21,160
early days were formed for the bubble

86
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:23,159
man just out the old

87
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,639
street we have a stop sign right in

88
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,360
front so we always had mad action in

89
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:29,720
front of this house there's always cars

90
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,800
non-stop there's actually three uh stop

91
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,360
stop signs out in front of this house

92
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,478
but enough of the stop signs out in

93
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,960
front of my house we will see you very

94
00:04:35,478 --> 00:04:38,560
soon and I suspect the next time we

95
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:40,159
light this camera up we're going to be

96
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,600
where the bubble man smoked his very

97
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,520
first joint ever here in Winnipeg

98
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,759
Manitoba so stay tuned for that we'll

99
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:49,120
catch you guys in a

100
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:51,038
bit hey guys bubble man here uh I'm in a

101
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,319
unique place right now that I have not

102
00:04:51,038 --> 00:04:57,439
been in a very long time this is the

103
00:04:54,319 --> 00:05:00,240
very location right here by this BFI can

104
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:03,360
this big garbage can that I smoked my

105
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,160
first cannabis joint ever in my entire

106
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,560
life so I thought it would be kind of a

107
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,039
neat thing to come back here get the

108
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,680
mother ship all loaded up and do a

109
00:05:08,038 --> 00:05:12,478
little bit of a torch rip on some bubs

110
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,759
and uh it's quite quite a few people

111
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:15,000
there's trucks over here that are

112
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,319
working and there's a bunch of people

113
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,680
over here that are working and I am

114
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:20,639
behind some

115
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,680
stores um Bibles for Missions over here

116
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,680
and uh I think we got a hair salon over

117
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:29,079
here so I just figured let's do this

118
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:32,439
let's have a rip in the spot where I

119
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:34,279
literally have had my first rib so it'll

120
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:37,240
be interesting to see if we

121
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:39,519
get if we get some people looking to see

122
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:42,000
what I am doing but

123
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:44,240
uh first time I ever smoked herb I was

124
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,560
14 years old I was with my good buddy

125
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,560
Steve

126
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,839
maoy and this was where we smoked right

127
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:55,198
by this can in fact so that's where I'm

128
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:57,719
going to smoke

129
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,919
today that's where I'm going to smoke

130
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,400
today and I've already got people people

131
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:04,680
watching

132
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:05,799
me all right so let's see what we got we

133
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,000
got

134
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:10,360
quartz then we got

135
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,959
bubs so first things first let's have a

136
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,960
little rip a

137
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:19,478
dip it'll be interesting to see what

138
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,000
these people think I'm doing back here

139
00:06:19,478 --> 00:06:24,879
cuz I'm sure people don't regularly come

140
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,279
back here to uh smoke anymore city has

141
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:28,879
dispensaries and other uh types of uh

142
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:30,478
lounges that you can go and actually

143
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:34,159
enjoy your camp and and you're not

144
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:36,199
forced like I was as a kid to come to

145
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:39,720
the back of an industrial neighborhood

146
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:41,879
and smoke next to a garbage can but alas

147
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:44,560
it is part of my history and I wanted to

148
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:45,879
share it with you guys so we are going

149
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,720

157
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:20,399
backup it's always good to have a backup

158
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:21,840
when you're uh looking to have a blaze

159

prefer it that

166
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:46,199
way to be

167
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:54,439
honest think they're just doing a little

168
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:59,959
cleaning behind me right

169
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:59,959
now all right well here we go guys

170
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:13,038
well there it

171
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:16,319
is probably the first time I've had a

172
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:20,240
puff at this location since I was 14

173
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:21,639
years old smoking my first joint so I

174
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,240
know it's not very exciting but I

175
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:27,079
figured I wanted to share it with you

176
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:29,240
guys and uh I guess there it is we have

177
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:31,478
smoked at bubble Man's first spot we'll

178
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:34,719
talk talk to you soon bye-bye hey guys

179
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:36,479
welcome back we are now at the in at the

180
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,440
forks uh I don't know if it's like a

181
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,000
four-star restaurant it's a fourstar

182
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:42,080
hotel it's a pretty nice little spot I'm

183
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,600
no longer at my mom's place over in the

184
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:47,480
east of Winnipeg but I'm here on the uh

185
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,519
edge of St bonfice and in fact if you

186
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:51,399
can see in the background there's a big

187
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:54,839
large building with four posts and to

188
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:57,440
the left of it uh there is a cross that

189
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:59,720
is the hospital that I was born on this

190
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,399
is a very cool little area the fork all

191
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,120
sorts of Little Shop set up and you got

192
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:06,519
the Children's Museum right across the

193
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,959
way and tons of beautiful places to go

194
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:11,360
dab outside which I'm going to go do

195
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:13,679
after this but I figured we would start

196
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:17,399
it off with a

197
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:19,078
dab inside the room I've already done a

198
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:20,839
few of these let me tell you we had hash

199
00:09:19,078 --> 00:09:23,879
church today which was a nice church a

200
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:25,240
little bit slower than usual uh everyone

201
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:26,759
was kind of in a party sort of space

202
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,000
with chalice last night and we didn't

203
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:29,919
have quite the amount of people that

204
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,159
normally come in but uh still a great

205
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:34,719
panel still some great discussion and uh

206
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:35,838
yeah I look forward to next week's hash

207
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,959
church for sure where we're going to

208
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:40,839
continue the hash discussion continue

209
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:43,838
the discussion on Rosen uh the efficacy

210
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:45,600
and the safety of pressing in screens uh

211
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,959
if there's any chemicals releasing if

212
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,680
there are plant foods that are left

213
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:52,799
behind in that plant matter and then

214
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:54,039
rosin and how is that affecting it so we

215
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:55,639
had all these different discussions

216
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:56,719
today if you watched P church it was

217
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:59,000
pretty

218
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,680
awesome um hopefully I'm going to bump

219
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
into to maybe one or two people locally

220
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:05,759
here I also uh love the idea of going to

221
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,159
Vapes on Main it's just on Main Street

222
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:10,639
which is just right behind me maybe even

223
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:12,120
tonight I can head down there and uh you

224
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:13,720
know maybe see the guys do a little

225
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,360
interview talk about what it's like

226
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:18,000
having the only Vapor Lounge in uh

227
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:21,120
Manitoba in Winnipeg and of course share

228
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:25,039
some dabs with those guys so my denail

229
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:29,879
is just about up to Temp it's at 570

230
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:31,439
degrees uh I've got it set today at 720

231
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:33,480
uh however what I was talking about in

232
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:37,680
hash church I I've lowered it from my

233
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:40,800
normal 750 to 720 and I dropped it right

234
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:43,078
below 600 so it's actually at

235
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:45,919
615 right now and that's where we're

236
00:10:43,078 --> 00:10:47,159
going to hit it let that quartz get a

237
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:49,240
little

238
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:51,838
bit

239
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:54,278
warmer always nice to have patience for

240
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:56,079
the dabs have patience for your dabs

241
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:58,360
people so yeah I've been here in

242
00:10:56,078 --> 00:10:59,919
Manitoba for about a week uh it's been a

243
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,639
lot of bugs there's definitely a lot of

244
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:03,159
bugs in Manitoba I've noticed even

245
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:05,440
thinking about going up by the river

246
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:07,719
tonight I think uh you know if the sun

247
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,240
goes down uh which I hope because it's

248
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:13,800
about 34° C out there which I don't know

249
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:16,399
it has to be 90 90 something degrees 85

250
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:19,719
90° it's definitely warm all right so

251
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,720
here we go

252
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,600
Beauty well that Rosen dab is going to

253
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:44,000

254
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:46,560
going I was looking for some uh butane

255
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,559
to get into the big shot gt800

256
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:51,679
here unfortunately we're going to have

257
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:55,679
to go Manitoba style and rock the giant

258
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:57,958
propane tank so we'll see how that goes

259
00:11:55,679 --> 00:12:01,159
we'll we'll go outside and we'll go uh

260
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:02,439
hit some dabs I got the new uh titanium

261
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:03,719
Banger so I think I'm going to bring

262
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:06,320
that with me this time and leave the

263
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:07,839
quartz at home and uh of course I'm

264
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,800

00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,198
on hey guys so just standing out in

268
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:28,958
front of my hotel room here and I

269
00:12:27,198 --> 00:12:30,799
figured we'd check out the river for the

270
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:32,278
start start of the day it's pretty early

271
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:34,439
do a little bit of a wake and bake down

272
00:12:32,278 --> 00:12:35,639
by the water Winnipeg Styles and then

273
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:38,680
later on today we're going to hopefully

274
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:40,839
hook up with my buddy Al and uh maybe go

275
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:43,078
byy Vapes on Maine which is the new uh

276
00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:45,079
vaporizer Lounge here in Winnipeg and if

277
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:46,359
I have time I'll also go byy the

278
00:12:45,078 --> 00:12:48,120
dispensary and check out what they've

279
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:50,120
got going on remember this is the city

280
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,519
that it all started for me so it's kind

281
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:53,600
of exciting even though it may seem a

282
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:56,720
little boring to you guys let's go puff

283
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,720
a bowl

284
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:17,239
it's a big

285
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:20,039
shoe so I guess this is the celebration

286
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:23,560
Circle it's kind of cool how they have

287
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:23,559
words carved into

288
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:32,759
the all right

289
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:35,559
the North Portage

290
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:37,838
partnership all

291
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:39,078
right should I go take a rip right in

292
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:42,839
the middle of this

293
00:13:39,078 --> 00:13:42,838
circle for everyone to

294
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:51,919
see well it is the celebration Circle

295
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:05,159
River's just over the bank

296
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:06,879
there H maybe I'll hit a bowl in the

297
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:08,719
celebration Circle in a bit I'll start

298
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:12,519
off by the

299
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,519
river seems like a good

300
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:32,639
plan maybe a bridge

301
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,639
a bridge over troubled

302
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:38,000
water looking for that morning and wake

303
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,000
and bake

304
00:14:50,278 --> 00:14:54,759
spot pretty cool Bridge

305
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:13,278
all right and there's the St bunny fast

306
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,278
Hospital across the

307
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,000
way

308
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,720
well

309
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,198
yeah all right guys so I'm here on the

310
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,680
bridge um going to have a little bowl

311
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:29,078
got the mother ship out got the torch

312
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:30,638
got the whole 9 yards so I guess really

313
00:15:29,078 --> 00:15:33,159
turn on this torch and see what we can't

314
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,600
get done here I am in a very open public

315
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:38,120
place but

316
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:40,319
uh from what I've heard a license is a

317
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:43,519
license and as long as you're

318
00:15:40,318 --> 00:15:45,360
uh you know within reason not in a super

319
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,278
duper public place and I'm on a bridge

320
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,639
right now with nobody so I think they

321
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:50,600
would allow me to get away with it it's

322
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,159
kind of hard to tell but I guess the

323
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,519
only real way you know in this day and

324
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:54,838
age is when the police come up to you

325
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,879
and talk to

326
00:15:54,839 --> 00:16:00,079
you nobody's on the bridge I feel pretty

327
00:15:57,879 --> 00:16:01,039
pretty confident I'm going to take a rip

328

good friend Reggie the Rody who I don't

367
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:24,240
know if you guys remember him he was an

368
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:25,840
old school guy that was on uh true

369
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:29,558
Stoners back in the

370
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:30,959
day he was um yeah he was on true

371
00:18:29,558 --> 00:18:32,480
Stoners back in the day that's where I

372
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,240
originally met him but he was from the

373
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,480
same city as me so I eventually ended up

374
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:39,359
meeting him in person years ago 12 plus

375
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,960
years ago and you would have seen him uh

376
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:45,158
on the recent degenerate art uh videos

377
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:47,240
that I released uh the backstage footage

378
00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:48,960
the sort of behind the scene interviews

379
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:51,759
that never made it into the actual

380
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,880
documentary but uh yeah check that out

381
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:55,640
if not and you'll recognize Reggie the

382
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,960
Rody and hopefully he's going to give us

383
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:59,280
a little tour of the city today maybe

384
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,720
some dispensaries Vaped on Maine and

385
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:03,480
potentially uh go to a really nice grow

386
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:05,798
of a friend of his so uh I guess we'll

387
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:08,240
stay tuned for that I'm really nicely

388
00:19:05,798 --> 00:19:09,759
medicated after a couple of Rosen dabs

389
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,359
so I'm going to walk this River a little

390
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:14,079
bit and uh we'll catch up with you guys

391
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:16,119
in a bit hey guys I just hooked up with

Winnipeg dude super good to see you

394
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,720
how's it going man Wicked This has been

395
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:24,080
uh like I said I've known Reggie for it

396
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:25,519
has to be over 12 years oh yeah 12 to 15

397
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:27,879
or something through true Stoners and

398
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:29,558
whatnot so he was finally telling me

399
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,559
about this building in the background

400
00:19:29,558 --> 00:19:33,759
that I I was like what is this building

401
00:19:31,558 --> 00:19:35,519
that you guys have I've never so tell us

402
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:37,558
again this is the human rights yeah the

403
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:42,158
Human Rights Museum in winipeg and they

404
00:19:37,558 --> 00:19:44,119
spent about $350 million on It come on

405
00:19:42,159 --> 00:19:47,080
and uh yeah I just read in the paper

406
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:49,279
hardly anybody goes to it and man for

407
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:51,480
$350 million you think that you could

408
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:53,918
probably uh really forward the Human

409
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:55,360
Rights Movement by actually helping

410
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,600
people whose human rights are being

411
00:19:55,359 --> 00:20:00,158
violated oh you would think so you would

412
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:01,319

00:23:44,679 --> 00:23:52,159
himself his father his daughter with

492
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:57,439
cannabis wow his his dad had ALS uh I

493
00:23:52,159 --> 00:24:00,840
think Bill is PTSD I'm not positive but

494
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:04,360
uh and I forget his daughter's ailment

495
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:06,558
but she has something nasty as well wow

496
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:08,359
so really stepping out really stepping

497
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:10,240
out from what he knows 30 years on the

498
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:11,678
police force to become sort of a can

499
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,240
well I guess not sort of but really a

500
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:16,600
cannabis activist well he's heavy

501
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:20,278
especially I'm sure getting busted was a

502
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:22,839
big part of it but uh although be very

503
00:24:20,278 --> 00:24:24,480
well may have supported leap before that

504
00:24:22,839 --> 00:24:26,158
I'm not sure well it'll be interesting

505
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,360
to get a couple questions to Bill and

506
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:30,320

force yep you can definitely see the

528
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:23,319
influence of the Ukrainian culture here

529
00:25:20,278 --> 00:25:26,839
in Manitoba with a church like that

530

check out Winnipeg's first dispensary

539
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:53,159
I'm so proud of Winnipeg for pulling

540
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,320
this together it's uh been a long time

541
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:57,080
coming keep in mind it was over 20 years

542
00:25:55,319 --> 00:26:00,359
ago that we did the hemp activism that

543
00:25:57,079 --> 00:26:01,960
led to cannabis hemp being grown uh

544
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:04,359
legally here for the first time in over

545
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:06,840
73 years and that hemp's been growing

546
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:08,918
non-stop ever since so uh hopefully we

547
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:11,079
can get the herbs uh going as well and

548
00:26:08,919 --> 00:26:13,320

I'm a volunteer here um it's Winnipeg's

566
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,798
first disc

567
00:26:58,839 --> 00:27:02,359
dude I'm so impressed that you guys are

568
00:27:00,798 --> 00:27:05,359
pushing the envelope pushing the

569
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:07,558
boundaries and uh you know making the

570
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:10,798
steps that are necessary to allow people

571
00:27:07,558 --> 00:27:12,918
that currently are being say let down by

572
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:15,038
the current license production

573
00:27:12,919 --> 00:27:17,320
facilities now I'm not blaming the

574
00:27:15,038 --> 00:27:20,119
licensed producers they have their hands

575
00:27:17,319 --> 00:27:22,278
tied so tightly uh that they're unable

576
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:24,439
to make extracts they're unable to

577
00:27:22,278 --> 00:27:27,119
produce Edibles and I'm sure that you

578
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:29,480
know as well as I do that um the best

579
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:32,519
way to use cannabis a medicine isn't

580
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:35,519
always to smoke it that's right I agree

581
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:39,240
uh the extract form is um very helpful

582
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:42,679
in medicinal ways uh the current uh

583
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:46,079
regulations don't allow total freedom of

584
00:27:42,679 --> 00:27:48,759
uh human of of our human rights and um

585
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:51,398
and for it is our right to decide what

586
00:27:48,759 --> 00:27:54,119
we put in our bodies um you know let's

587
00:27:51,398 --> 00:27:56,558
face it one can actually debate that the

588
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:59,879
Draconian law the narcotics act from

589
00:27:56,558 --> 00:28:02,558
1923 was uh introduced because of a

590
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:05,200
opium issue that we had in Canada they

591
00:28:02,558 --> 00:28:07,519
threw a marijuana prohibition within the

592
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,480
cardic act and one could actually say

593
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:13,278
that these Draconian laws are creating

594
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:15,839
societal ills today and that this is a

595
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:19,200
wonderful medicine that cures cancer

596
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:21,599
helps epilepsy I myself been diagnosed

597
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:24,080
with post-traumatic stress disorder I've

598
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:27,079
met a lot of individuals from the

599
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:28,839
military uh that is doing wonderful

600
00:28:27,079 --> 00:28:32,038
success there's been in scientific

601
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:34,199
research how the cannaboids help uh the

602
00:28:32,038 --> 00:28:37,480
brain and its memory function to

603
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:39,759
actually delete the trauma um from

604
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:41,519
individuals for pts that's huge I mean

605
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:44,278
that's uh it's pretty incredible to

606
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:47,359
think that cannabis is the plant that

607
00:28:44,278 --> 00:28:49,440
has the backs of our soldiers of our men

608
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:51,959
and women that have gone uh to fight in

609
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,960
Wars around the world uh both in America

610
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:55,679
and Canada and when they come back it's

611
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:57,159
not the government who has their back

612
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:59,559
the government whose Freedom they fought

613
00:28:57,159 --> 00:29:02,480
for it's the plant who the government

614
00:28:59,558 --> 00:29:04,759
has been trying to eradicate uh since

615
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:07,038
you know for close to 100 years yes and

616
00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:08,759
getting back to licensed producers uh

617
00:29:07,038 --> 00:29:11,038
I'm with the licensed producers that I

618
00:29:08,759 --> 00:29:13,480
found out that are radiating the product

619
00:29:11,038 --> 00:29:16,079
which puts fear into my system I'm

620
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:19,278
extremely healthy individual um I

621
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:23,398
believe in uh high protein uh High

622
00:29:19,278 --> 00:29:27,880
upline diet um and I do not want any

623
00:29:23,398 --> 00:29:31,479
other um process done I I like organic

624
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:33,840
and I really want to choose I should

625
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:36,480
have a choice my constitutional right to

626
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:38,480
choose where I get a healthy product and

627
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:41,319
nothing that's been tampered with even

628
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:44,360
from the largest licensed producer in

629
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:46,759
Canada so uh you know you you want to be

00:31:26,558 --> 00:31:30,558
people in the business um especially

670
00:31:28,278 --> 00:31:33,880
from Vancouver because it's a successful

671
00:31:30,558 --> 00:31:36,240
model the legalization in the states in

672
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:39,159
Denver Colorado and Seattle Washington

673
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:42,159
these are successful models on raising

674
00:31:39,159 --> 00:31:46,519
money to help with infrastructure and

675
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:50,278
lower crime this and most importantly

676
00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:53,319
increase quality of life in sick

677
00:31:50,278 --> 00:31:56,679
individuals and prevent sickness in

678
00:31:53,319 --> 00:31:59,638
healthy individuals my my 74 year-old

679
00:31:56,679 --> 00:32:02,759
mother who's suffering incredible pain

680
00:31:59,638 --> 00:32:05,599
from arthritis uh and she has incredible

681
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:08,679
anxiety I'm taking her off larzipan

682
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:12,398
she's already off it and she's taking

683
00:32:08,679 --> 00:32:14,798
cookies um baked goods inestables and

684
00:32:12,398 --> 00:32:17,119
she's actually doing a lot better she's

685
00:32:14,798 --> 00:32:19,278
sleeping and she's not uh in chronic

686
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:21,518
pain anymore that's awesome so this is

687
00:32:19,278 --> 00:32:23,599
proof I have people coming in here

688
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:26,880
saying my wife is cured of cancer from

689
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:28,959
the CBD oil and people are actually have

690
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,600
real testimonies and that's that's the

691
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,159
real thing so we always like to tell

692
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:33,959
people that it shuts it off and that

693
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:35,600
they should be careful uh because if

694
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:38,038
they have that cancer in them it they it

695
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:41,240
can shrink it and sort of shut it off

696
00:32:38,038 --> 00:32:43,558
but I would still maintain uh a a fairly

697
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:45,919
solid saturation of my endoc canabo

698
00:32:43,558 --> 00:32:48,638
system meaning I would still orally

699
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:51,399
consume canabo potentially maybe uh

700
00:32:48,638 --> 00:32:54,439
extracted in uh maybe a coconut oil

701
00:32:51,398 --> 00:32:56,638
daily just to prevent that cancer from

702
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:58,679
ever sort of growing back and and taking

703
00:32:56,638 --> 00:33:01,719
root again uh that's that's a great

704
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:03,639
maintaining program um definitely it's I

705
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:07,759
I mean it's it's part of a high alkaline

706
00:33:03,638 --> 00:33:09,678
diet I mean when uh you do um get

707
00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:11,720
diagnosed with cancer they do suggest to

708
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:14,000
have a high alkaline leafy diet first

709
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:16,159
thing and go and we're talking about

710
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,159
cannaboids this is the only plant in the

711
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:21,320
world that produces it it works great

712
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:24,360
with our body and it helps heal so this

713
00:33:21,319 --> 00:33:27,319
is um something very positive and it's

714
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:29,119
becoming uh mainstream and it's becoming

715
00:33:27,319 --> 00:33:31,519
accepted as in today's society what we

716
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:33,079
do need is politicians and we we are

717
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:36,960

to think for the 21st century and they

722
00:33:43,798 --> 00:33:50,319

thumbs up to you guys for standing up to

772
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:48,199
open a dispensary here in Manitoba in

773
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:51,280
Winnipeg uh it's really pushing the

774
00:35:48,199 --> 00:35:54,439
envelope and I think it's right on time

775
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:56,800
with uh Vancouver mayor uh regulating

776
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:58,440
dispensaries and I think that uh your

777
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:01,119
timing is literally perfect and I

778
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:04,440
applaud you uh for doing it because it's

779
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:07,400
still Brave in this part of the world it

780
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:10,119
you're really uh you're putting yourself

781
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:12,039
out there yeah but you have to do for

782
00:36:10,119 --> 00:36:14,240
what you believe in right yeah and I

783
00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:18,119
believe in this and believe in that

784
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:20,838
people it helps people and once I

785
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:22,599
started helping people I couldn't stop

786
00:36:20,838 --> 00:36:25,440
yeah it's a bit addicted isn't it yeah

787
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:27,359
and so how did you get into uh you know

788
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,559
a brief history I I assume that you've

789
00:36:27,358 --> 00:36:33,480
had relationship with cannabis for a

790
00:36:29,559 --> 00:36:35,639
while started smoking at 9 I'm 54 so we

791
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:39,079
got we got some some Decades of of

792
00:36:35,639 --> 00:36:41,519
cannabis uh use under our belts so what

793
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:44,160
what really sort of sparked the idea

794
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:47,920
that you would start a dispensary here

795
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:52,239
in W because there was no one doing

796
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:56,119
anything to educate people and move

797
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:58,078
ahead with the dispensary yes uh there's

798
00:36:56,119 --> 00:37:01,400
other places in winipeg that open up and

799
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:04,480
they're doing a great job

800
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:06,480
but I don't know I just I just felt they

801
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:08,599
had to do this get the education out

802
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,679
there to get the education out there to

803

that's a good call that's really where

816
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:46,199
it starts you need to educate the

817
00:37:44,039 --> 00:37:48,119
doctors locally and uh I would

818
00:37:46,199 --> 00:37:50,519
definitely urge you guys to pull out as

819
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:52,440
much information as you can from uh the

820
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:54,719
local Sunday show I run called hash

821
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:57,079
church it's a a panel I'd love to have

822
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:58,799
you on Monday actually come to yeah

823
00:37:57,079 --> 00:38:00,119
absolutely come let let us know what's

824
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,960
going on in Winnipeg it would be a good

825
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:03,559
way for you to get your message out let

826
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:06,000
people know in Manitoba how to get in

827
00:38:03,559 --> 00:38:09,039
touch with you and uh just sort of kind

828
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,880
of meet you through this unique platform

829
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:13,480
that is uh the bubble man's world really

830
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,880
yeah appreciate so I guess today we're

831
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:16,440
going to sit down and I I told these

832
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:19,000
guys I would show them a little rosin

833
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:20,838
Tech and I got my little rosin kit here

834
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:25,280
I've got the uh the little mini hair

835
00:38:20,838 --> 00:38:28,119
straightener the raw um parchment paper

836
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:30,200
and of course the bubble bag screen now

837
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:32,000
the straightener has to be flat it has

838
00:38:30,199 --> 00:38:33,759
no edges to it whatsoever yeah you want

839
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,480
it to be flat and that's you'll see

840
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,520
right away when we do this process now

841
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:39,119
we're going to do a little bit of

842
00:38:36,519 --> 00:38:42,280
headband hash it's got a real nice smell

843
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:45,640
to it it's a 120 headand is my favorite

844
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:47,800
oh nice yeah it's a it's real nice oh it

845
00:38:45,639 --> 00:38:51,078
smells like the oh yeah it's got a real

846
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:54,160
rank sort of dank some some pepper

847
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:56,680
pepper smell some oh yeah nice e

848
00:38:54,159 --> 00:38:58,039
spicy it was Dwayne right that's right

849
00:38:56,679 --> 00:38:59,799
right I didn't introduce Dwayne and

850
00:38:58,039 --> 00:39:01,599
Kelly I did introduce Kelly earlier but

851
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:03,119
Dwayne and Kelly are also here with us

852
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:05,838
and we're uh we're just going to make

853
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:08,200
some rosin let's do this we'll use a

854
00:39:05,838 --> 00:39:09,880
nice fresh spot on the screen so you can

855
00:39:08,199 --> 00:39:13,399
really kind of get an

856
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:15,760
idea and uh and how good is this size of

857
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:19,599
screen to this is a good size screen

858
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:21,880
this is a 25 micron um the hash itself

859
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:24,800
is a 120 Micron so this hash was

860
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:26,838
collected in 120 Micron screen so all of

861
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:30,039
these glandular heads would be larger

862
00:39:26,838 --> 00:39:32,838
than 20 microns and smaller than 160

863
00:39:30,039 --> 00:39:34,639
microns which is the other next bag

864
00:39:32,838 --> 00:39:37,039
above 120 if you're familiar with the

865
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:39,559
Bubble Bags they start at a blue bag

866
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:42,719
which is a 220 goes to a green bag which

867
00:39:39,559 --> 00:39:44,799
is a 190 and trim and trim identifies it

868
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:46,439
well this is uh the trim does identify

869
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,200
it on the bags but the bags are all that

870
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:51,679
one color so you'll get a blue bag a

871
00:39:48,199 --> 00:39:53,199
green bag 190 then I thought a red 160

872
00:39:51,679 --> 00:39:57,719
the one that's right above this the

873
00:39:53,199 --> 00:40:00,919
orange 120 uh 90 which is black 7 which

874
00:39:57,719 --> 00:40:02,879
is gold 45 white and then finally the 25

875
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:05,519
which is this size screen is a purple

876
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:07,920
bag so the bags come with these as

877
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:10,358
pressing screens to dab the water out of

878
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:12,838
the hash to prepare it for micro planing

879
00:40:10,358 --> 00:40:15,440
or seing which is another show

880
00:40:12,838 --> 00:40:18,358
altogether but yeah we'll just get this

881
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:22,519
wrapped up in a little kind of

882
00:40:18,358 --> 00:40:24,440
ball looks the P pretty much Little

883
00:40:22,519 --> 00:40:26,400
Ghost little hash that's exactly what

884
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:28,119
it's going to be a little hash ghost so

885
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,760
it's a good idea to put press it too you

886
00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:31,838
can kind of see just from pressing it

887
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:34,440
that the oils are already starting to

888
00:40:31,838 --> 00:40:36,279
appear on on the tiny amount it's a very

889
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:37,760
tiny amount so you know it's not like

890
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:39,319
we're going to get a huge amount back

891
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:42,520
but it'll definitely be enough that

892
00:40:39,318 --> 00:40:45,039
you'll see it on the parching table is

893
00:40:42,519 --> 00:40:47,358
uh are we plugged in with the uh the

894
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:48,679
hair straightener should be okay we are

895
00:40:47,358 --> 00:40:50,719
plugged in

896
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:52,279
yeah all right so you guys got to see

897
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:53,799
that simply enough right there's nothing

898
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:56,000
oh no she's not warm at all no no don't

899
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:57,440
worry I can turn it on okay and it when

900
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,039
I turn it on it can only be turned turn

901
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:01,079
on for a small amount of time before

902
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:04,119
it'll get too warm so I'll have to do

903
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:06,280
the pressing and then we'll turn it

904
00:41:04,119 --> 00:41:09,119
off e up

905
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:11,640
so here we go with this now you'll hear

906
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:14,680
it sizzling night

907
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:17,239
potentially but you'll also seees start

908
00:41:14,679 --> 00:41:19,199
leaking out of

909
00:41:17,239 --> 00:41:23,078
these the

910
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:27,838
paper the top yeah the sides oh yeah

911
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:27,839
it's all right so that's one

912
00:41:30,519 --> 00:41:35,480
okay now now do you that's a nice smell

913
00:41:33,679 --> 00:41:37,318
yeah it's like beautiful oil with no

914
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:40,318
solvents like made in a fraction of a

915
00:41:37,318 --> 00:41:40,318
second that's Bey

916
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:46,719
smell plus is good work

917
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:48,039
out yep and just a small little amount

918
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:52,399
of

919
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:56,079
hash and we've got dabs wow boom dabs

920
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:57,920
and then uh a tiny little puck oh W of

921
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:01,039
hash that you could then take and you

922
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:03,440
could put that into a coconut oil you

923
00:42:01,039 --> 00:42:04,880
could soak this cuz there's still oil

924
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,679
soaked into the pressing screen you

925
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:08,400
could soak and recollect that either in

926
00:42:06,679 --> 00:42:11,838
an Ever Clear I would say is probably

927
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:13,240
the safest a 190 proof Vapor evaporate

928
00:42:11,838 --> 00:42:15,159
out the alcohol and you'll be left with

929
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:16,598
like glass like literally like very

930
00:42:15,159 --> 00:42:18,440
potent medicine that you could once

931
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:20,480
again stuff people would have been

932
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:23,559
throwing away produce a highgrade

933
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:25,519
coconut extract with it and you know

934
00:42:23,559 --> 00:42:27,760
some kidney and liver cancer can you use

935
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:29,358
a larger amount than you just did

936
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:31,359
yeah yeah you can my friends are using

937
00:42:29,358 --> 00:42:33,838
50 60 G at a time and using giant

938
00:42:31,358 --> 00:42:35,920
t-shirt presses getting

939
00:42:33,838 --> 00:42:39,199

954
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:28,838
is right in front of your own eyes this

955
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:30,880
is organic as like there's no you know

956
00:43:28,838 --> 00:43:34,519
what I like about this there's nothing

957
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:36,880
as adults we are able to find the safest

958
00:43:34,519 --> 00:43:39,079
way to do things easier than we were

959
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,838
when we were kids and so what I love

960
00:43:39,079 --> 00:43:43,800
about this is that the younger people

961
00:43:40,838 --> 00:43:47,558
the younger generation that were just

962
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:50,119
yesterday even blowing up making butan

963
00:43:47,559 --> 00:43:52,319
not the best way to go about things blow

964
00:43:50,119 --> 00:43:54,039
kids blowing up is by far the worst

965
00:43:52,318 --> 00:43:55,880
thing that's ever happened in me

966
00:43:54,039 --> 00:43:57,558
cannabis world before that it was the

967
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:59,680
DEA it was the

968
00:43:57,559 --> 00:44:02,240
that's why Health Canada is smart and

969
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:04,358
and we're allowed to produce uh uh

970
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:07,239
resins and oils but without the butane

971
00:44:04,358 --> 00:44:08,799
process because because of its dangerous

972
00:44:07,239 --> 00:44:10,759
activity to well you don't want to be

973
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,480
blowing yourself up or whatnot this this

974
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:17,599
is just much

975
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:17,599
easier man it's t cleaner it's so

976
00:44:18,358 --> 00:44:25,318

while as you guys know the Owen Smith

992
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:05,720
case in British Columbia which really

993
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:08,679
cracked open derivatives for all of

994
00:45:05,719 --> 00:45:12,039
Canada based on seven uh Supreme Court

995
00:45:08,679 --> 00:45:14,000
just justices who just decided was all

996
00:45:12,039 --> 00:45:15,719
oh yeah all seven of them voted that it

997
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,400
had to change I love you Supreme Court

998
00:45:15,719 --> 00:45:19,639
Justices and that derivatives had to be

999
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:21,920
allowed but before they did that how

1000
00:45:19,639 --> 00:45:25,598
that case got to the Supreme Court was

1001
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:28,159
it was given um a descent I believe it's

1002
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:29,640
called out of the Supreme Court of DC

1003
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:32,598
which is the provincial Supreme Court

1004
00:45:29,639 --> 00:45:34,598
three judges uh they took the case there

1005
00:45:32,599 --> 00:45:36,920
and one of the judges basically struck

1006
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:39,760
down the law changed the word dried to

1007
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:41,838
just marijuana and for a couple of years

1008
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:43,640
in British Columbia we were allowed

1009
00:45:41,838 --> 00:45:45,759
derivatives and extracts I've been

1010
00:45:43,639 --> 00:45:47,279
allowed them in for my Canadian license

1011
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:49,599
for several years now and now it's

1012
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:51,920
Federal now it's it's Federal before I

1013
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:55,359
was not allowed to bring my concentrates

1014
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:57,440
to Manitoba or to Ontario or to any of

1015
00:45:55,358 --> 00:46:00,078

00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:07,838
wonderful and delicious was great to

1082
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:10,000
share uh some raos and dabs with you

1083
00:49:07,838 --> 00:49:12,000
guys show you the process which I

1084
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,559
suspect in the near future you'll be

1085
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:17,519
able to come down to the uh cannabis

1086
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:19,798
headquarters and uh potentially pick up

1087
00:49:17,519 --> 00:49:22,159
some rosin of of their own I believe you

1088
00:49:19,798 --> 00:49:24,039
will be so you can do it with flowers as

1089
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:25,719
well so you can make flower rosin and

1090
00:49:24,039 --> 00:49:27,920
you can make hash rosin and can you use

1091
00:49:25,719 --> 00:49:29,798
the same screen for for both you don't

1092
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:32,559
even need a screen for for flowers you

1093
00:49:29,798 --> 00:49:33,960
can just put it bre there close it just

1094
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:35,640
understand the smaller the bud you use

1095
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:37,838
the higher the yield seems to be the

1096
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:39,598
more bud you put if there's not enough

1097
00:49:37,838 --> 00:49:42,318
water or moisture in

1098
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:44,559
the steaming it out it has a further

1099
00:49:42,318 --> 00:49:46,480
distance to travel you want to use dense

1100
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:48,400
dense yeah you just want yeah it's nice

1101
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:51,639
to even some people take and kind of

1102
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:53,838
press it up to get it pre- ready for for

1103
00:49:51,639 --> 00:49:55,558
pressing Al will be able to walk you

1104
00:49:53,838 --> 00:49:57,279
guys through that when he comes back

1105
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:58,559
he'll press out some buds show you what

1106
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:02,240
you've seen it once now you'll be able

1107
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:04,480
to riding the bike ring bik just don't

1108
00:50:02,239 --> 00:50:06,719
over press or you'll get a very very

1109
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:08,358
dark product hash is always going to

1110
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:10,558
produce a darker product so you'll get

1111
00:50:08,358 --> 00:50:12,358
something like that right whereas with

1112
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:15,480
uh you know with the bud you can get

1113
00:50:12,358 --> 00:50:17,239
clear and and yellow product very easily

1114
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:19,079
and sativas are probably best to work

1115
00:50:17,239 --> 00:50:20,959
with they they all work great all the

1116
00:50:19,079 --> 00:50:24,839
plants that have resin will will you'll

1117
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:26,798
be able to learn a lot about your plants

1118
00:50:24,838 --> 00:50:28,000
and the buds by how much sometimes

1119
00:50:26,798 --> 00:50:29,519
you'll take a butt and you'll squeeze it

1120

good

1122

someone sitting with

1124
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:38,000

a button you press it you open it up and

1126

oil everywhere other times you get like

1128
