going to run through and we've been

10
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:25,518
basically dry sifting it with some new

11
00:00:22,839 --> 00:00:29,079
screens that I'm selling these large 5ft

12
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:31,278
by 3T screens we're breaking the butt up

13
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:32,839
over them gently

14
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:35,000
and then under that is a secondary

15
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:38,160
screen that we capture the resin on top

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,039
of and then a small amount of the resin

17
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:44,479
is making its way below the secondary

18
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:45,800
