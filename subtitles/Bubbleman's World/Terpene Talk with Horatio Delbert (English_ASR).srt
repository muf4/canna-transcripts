[Music]

2
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,000
well welcome to Bubble man's world guys

3
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,599
bubble man here with my good buddy

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,640
Horatio in the house sir and uh sh what

5
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,679
are we going to talk about today we're

6
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,719
going to talk about an interesting

7
00:00:29,678 --> 00:00:35,079
little yeah we're gonna I mean on the

8
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:39,079
hash Church where me and Tony and K from

9
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:41,520
Tri Technologies got into uh tpin to a

10
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:44,759
high degree Kenny kind of isolated that

11
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:47,239
the main thrust was to I get at that 90%

12
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:49,839
of what's lost during the drying process

13
00:00:47,238 --> 00:00:51,599
because that's what we don't experience

14
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,920
those are the most volatile we know them

15
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:58,198
from smelling Frozen cth that's just off

16
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:00,399
gassing and I kind of already knew that

17
00:00:58,198 --> 00:01:02,399
if there's there's only so many ways we

18
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,879
can get back to the plant in its full

19
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,439
Essence and we've seen the trend of live

20
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:10,240
resin and things like that we've seen

21
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:13,438
live sift pop up here and there it's

22
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:15,679
pretty unstable but it's happened and um

23
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:18,199
I always look at sustainable methods to

24
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,280
recreate that end without the downside

25
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:23,759
so uh right now we're going to be

26
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,840
looking at uh some pecs uh we saw that

27
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:29,000
on our Mega chill episode is that the

28
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:31,920
Pineapple Express yeah packs nice the

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,920
packs

30
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:39,640
so this is the PEX wet it's been crushed

31
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:43,759
all day so that's never been

32
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,759
dry okay so you get the raw

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,560
raw interesting yeah so you can kind of

34
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,399
see I mean it's been going you know I

35
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:56,680
can literally remember being like uh

36
00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:00,320
like maybe even before high school and

37
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:02,200
buying herb like this and thinking

38
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:03,758
at this herb look at how crazy you smell

39
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,039
this you smell it no but like feel it

40
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,239
bro feel how it's like spongy like that

41
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:09,719
this is going to roll so good and then

42
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:11,959
my buddy's like yeah it's like 80% water

43
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:14,120
dude the [ __ ] are you doing this is wet

44
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:15,840
weed so that's interesting okay we've

45
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,400
got the wet sample which is a nice kind

46
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,400
of in my opinion it's a great way if

47
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:23,200
you're going to go through a a series

48
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:25,400
what he has is fresh dry yeah so let's

49
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:27,719
check out dry and really I got to

50
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:31,640
package this up cuz this is still off

51
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:33,199
gasing like crazy and taking

52
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:35,878
taking the room so kind of when you

53
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:38,759
smell that oh yeah what's cured versus

54
00:02:35,878 --> 00:02:41,639
what's lost yes exactly you can

55
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:44,359
definitely smell the smell much stronger

56
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:47,318
in this that is in that but is being

57
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:49,000
masked by all that water it's just being

58
00:02:47,318 --> 00:02:52,359
held

59
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,598
back interesting and I wonder if that's

60
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:57,280
because the turps are preserved in the

61
00:02:54,598 --> 00:02:59,560
fresh herb completely and you would need

62
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,719
to um you know release some of that

63
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,959
water in order for some of those tpin to

64
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:06,639
volatize and evaporate away before you

65
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:10,000
were released with that properly cured

66
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:12,000
properly dried herb well I do have a

67
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,519
piece of Bud up my nose I don't know how

68
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,158
that happened but my eyes are watering

69
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:20,239
but but my eyes are watering but it's

70
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:22,519
like the the confusing part about

71
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:26,719
smelling this is because it's wet you

72
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:29,360
can't tell the water from the volatiles

73
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:31,799
I mean I do no not until you smell that

74
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,280
yeah now if you smell this and then go

75
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:36,200
back to this I think you're going to be

76
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,519
able to smell those because this is that

77
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:41,438
smell without the the water it's those

78
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:43,360
volatiles volatiles without the water Al

79
00:03:41,438 --> 00:03:45,680
many many are gone from there as well

80
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,159
well that's so now you have this is why

81
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,879
I T got to the point where I'm like okay

82
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:53,039
there's many ways to isolate Tarpin

83
00:03:49,878 --> 00:03:55,840
there's whole tarpine packages and

84
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:59,120
because my developmental aim was on that

85
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:02,158
isolate knowing this came from this

86
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,840
means I'm know the TPS that I have right

87
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:06,560
are only what I would lose because this

88
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:09,680
is still representing good bud this is

89
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:12,400
what I know right what medicinal aspects

90
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,959
are present in because you I split the

91
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,280
water from those turps are these super

92
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,720
turps are these do these turps enhance

93
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:21,798
or high is it just a percentage of these

94
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,680
same turps we need a lab to test them

95
00:04:21,798 --> 00:04:26,239
and find out the names of these turps

96
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,120
well I mean even just being able to test

97
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,879
through suggested they were the

98
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,478
sesquiterpenoids that were the most

99
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:34,478
volatile the super tarpine well it t i

100
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:36,758
mean now okay so for instance we've got

101
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:39,839
the dry and we know this PEX is made

102
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:41,800
from dried material I didn't try any um

103
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:44,239
okay livick technology I think dry

104
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:48,319
sifting is not a misnomer when you're

105
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:52,079
dry sifting you should dry and then sift

106
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:55,159
if you try to turn this into a frozen

107
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:57,639
Rock and then quickly try to pulverize

108
00:04:55,160 --> 00:05:00,600
it isolate the

109
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:04,160
heads all throughout the pro process

110
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:07,080
every bit of head every w w look I got

111
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,439
to make a point in that dry eyes process

112
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:11,758
all of the contaminate are all I got a

113
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:14,360
second one probably you do don't worry

114
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:17,840
we'll fluff it um that just gets mashed

115
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:19,639
into a wet sugary paste right it's not

116
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:22,519
like when debris hits dry heads hard

117
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:24,360
heads brittle heads that in that bounce

118
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:26,120
you essentially make a smear Patty now

119
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,879
I've tried to keep it cold and cold and

120
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:30,360
cold and sift it and then try to dry

121
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:33,360
those remaining heads

122
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:35,759
but it's always been a polka do kidcope

123
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,520
of pasties that are essentially because

124
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:41,199
it dries perfect on the

125
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:43,478
diluted the the dilution that it occurs

126
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,759
on naturally on the plant that's where

127
00:05:43,478 --> 00:05:48,079
it dries the best I mean that's kind of

128
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,720
why I mean we don't know where this is

129
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:52,758
going to last preservative wise but

130
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:54,479
being able to do this process correctly

131
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:56,680
versus reaching out to methods that

132
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:59,279
aren't appropriate and then being able

133
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,959
to reintroduce it back it's more of an

134
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:03,879
ultimate made experience then to try to

135
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:06,000
process wet material unnaturally now you

136
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:08,159
have a piece of butt on your nose tip

137
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,199
after I got one up my nose you know what

138
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,000
I was just noticing the sift just is the

139
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:15,879
perfect example of the flavor of that

140
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,120
bud but now instead of the water smell

141
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:20,759
missing like the way this smelled from

142
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,959
this you have that chlorophyll plant

143
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:24,720
matter Haze smell missing that you don't

144
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:27,159
even really notice when you first smell

145
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,880
this just smells like nice Bud yeah then

146
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:32,560
you smell this and you're like oh that

147
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:35,159
was nice bud with the smell of hay and

148
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:39,199
plant matter and chlorophyll along with

149
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:42,400
that smell that's kind of to process

150
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:44,280
your sift with that even just the juices

151
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:46,079
from that chlorophyll present are going

152
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:48,399
to be altering and bathing your sift you

153
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:51,079
can dry it but it's why it's called dry

154
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:52,279
sift it's um you know it really is I

155
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:54,199
know a lot of people are stoked on

156
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:56,799
trying to do dry ice and then clean it

157
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:58,720
from there but the problem is not that

158
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,319
the dry ice is making the hash wet it's

159
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,319
that the hash is wet it's never been

160
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:07,280
properly dried and they don't think that

161
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:09,598
it's wet what I mean I can get a result

162
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:11,598
but that result changed I'm like these

163
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:13,719
particles aren't supposed to be at this

164
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:16,038
Micron size but they're stuck here cuz

165
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,639
they came on Tri they get all clumped up

166
00:07:16,038 --> 00:07:19,079
together whereas it's like now you're

167
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:21,319
trying to dry them all in this weird

168
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:23,318
Clump in a way that they never occur in

169
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:25,639
nature that's pretty much it you let

170
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:27,439
them dry in these like could you imagine

171
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:29,240
if you were trying to design a perfect

172
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:30,839
way to dry tricomb heads look at that

173
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,960
picture on the wall isn't that what you

174
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:34,719
would design the elaborated space just

175
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:36,799
like a bunch of nail heads and then you

176
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,160
just balance a ball on only the thing is

177
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:42,840
it's only nature that could do the

178
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:45,120
subdivisional spacing so

179
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:47,560
perfectly it's awesome clearly I'm

180
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,399
somebody who has the power to choose um

181
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,839
I've done the wet material I've looked

182
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:53,719
at the result and by the time I dry it I

183
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:57,000
get the same tarpine profile cuz it's

184
00:07:53,720 --> 00:08:00,360
dry but with a whole bunch of [ __ ] in it

185
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,519
the quality changes and it can never

186
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,120
static nothing can change the fact that

187
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:06,279
the contaminants were pasted into the

188
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:08,639
heads wet yeah yeah that's unfortunate

189
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:10,719
so they're on like stickers I I'll say

190
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:14,158
it again when you're trying and playing

191
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:16,560
around with dry sift try with the driest

192
00:08:14,158 --> 00:08:19,879
material possible that's a good

193
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,399
foundation to get you on the way for to

194
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:24,319
discovering new and great things if

195
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:26,560
you're mocking around with wet with wet

196
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,439
heads uh you're going to you know not to

197
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,879
say don't do that cuz maybe someone

198
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:31,719
that's the game they want to play or

199
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:34,719
whatnot and they might have a huge

200
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:36,519
Discovery but truly um I I believe dry

201
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,839
sifting is not a misnomer it's an

202
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:39,240
accurate description for what we're

203
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:44,039
doing we're

204
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:46,799
dry sifting even when you I cuz I

205
00:08:44,038 --> 00:08:48,199
remember live sift oh my God what if

206
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:50,479
what if oh I got to try I got to try I'm

207
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,839
smart enough I can do anything and I'm

208
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,000
like this is neat but this isn't

209
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:56,800
practical this isn't this is actually

210
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,600
impractical and now I'm going to have to

211
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:02,240
[ __ ] my product um because somebody

212
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,600
who just puts in the harder work um is

213
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,480
going to get a better result now I'm in

214
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:09,120
a position now

215
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,720
where I can get the best of both worlds

216
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,600
but I'm also speaking to the fact I

217
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,360
dried this to get this and what I

218
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:17,278
isolate from this we're going to work

219
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:19,039
out ways to reincorporate that back um

220
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:21,720
it'll be interesting to see how that

221
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:23,480
affects white out um because of the

222
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,639
direct introduction of tpin to the

223
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:27,440
outside of the head so I wouldn't mind

224
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:30,000
doing some time lapse trials where we

225
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,440
just see that macro and see if it breaks

226
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,720
down how it breaks down does it dilute

227
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,880
does it become a shatter it's an option

228
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:40,680
that pure chlorophyll free heads gives

229
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:42,240
us so well I'm about ready to dip into

230
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:45,838
these

231
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:49,560
unadulterated pure chlorophyll free

232
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:53,040
heads it just looks so darn

233
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:54,759
nice clean my dab BR out so nice before

234
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:56,799
I put it in

235
00:09:54,759 --> 00:10:01,319
there nice

236
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:01,319
little a nice little dab

237
00:10:04,078 --> 00:10:09,838
all right I'm excited uh peex yeah

238
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,159
Express's the car

239
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:44,360
I don't know what that was that wasn't

240
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,240
from your head that was something

241
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,519
totally

242
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,360
different

243
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:53,720
excellent you going to hit some of the

244
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:55,320
packs yeah so I mean in the coming weeks

245
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,680
that's what I'm really excited about is

246
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:02,680
developing a technique to

247
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:05,439
reintroduce the UND dryable aspects of

248
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:08,399
the plant I mean we're always searching

249
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,399
for the message the messenger seems to

250
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,320
always be changing every new test says

251
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,879
something different you almost threw

252
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,680
away a a canabo that you didn't know

253
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:19,799
existed and um this is now your chance

254
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:22,359
to redevelop it so I mean that's kind of

255
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:24,679
why all these canabo with the

256
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:27,680
abbreviation of V seem to be so exciting

257
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:30,239
because we keep finding new secondary

258
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:33,159
thcv CBD

259
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:36,120
it's going in so I'm pretty excited to

260
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:38,958
see how are these precursor tpin are

261
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:41,120
they simpler why are they feel so wet

262
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:43,679
sure yeah no it's very exciting to learn

263
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,879
more and more about the profiles as we

264
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:48,719
um categorize and name all these unknown

265
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:51,320
tpin and unknown canabo for that matter

266
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:54,720
and perhaps even a whole new underlining

267
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:56,120
U molecule for all we know um it'll just

268
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,000
be interesting as the science goes

269
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:00,120
deeper into it and we have younger

270
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,039
people up and coming and going to school

271
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:05,000
for these specific subjects I'm really

272
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:06,919
excited to see what countries jump on

273
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,399
board and what universities get on board

274
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:11,838
for offering courses in agriculture and

275
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:14,440
botney and the chemistry well I

276
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:16,519
specifically of cannabis well I mean

277
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:18,560
when I hear these tpine names just

278
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:20,839
because I focus so long on herbs that

279
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:22,518
were medicinal and other type of

280
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:23,920
derivative products that I'm like I know

281
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:26,360
that name I know what it does I just

282
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:29,278
have to go back to my book and then I

283
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:31,639
get a whole new picture of what this can

284
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:34,320
this plant's message might be based on

285
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:36,120
those tpine profiles even when we know

286
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,879
that science of really discovering every

287
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:41,278
name to everything is always a Perpetual

288
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:42,759
Rubik's Cube spot even just going

289
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:45,078
through a name of 30 of the most

290
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:49,120
dominant and then matching it I'm

291
00:12:45,078 --> 00:12:51,599
abolutely okay no alone 160 to 300 I'm

292
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,600
like it's not just a guess this is the

293
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,560
smell of pain relief I bet you I could

294
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,839
make an arom theic product that would

295
00:12:55,559 --> 00:13:00,479
without the weed even just looking at

296
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,399
again that isolate without destroying my

297
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,079
medicine in the bud taking something

298
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,440
we've never known could people be

299
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:08,120
getting a benefit from whatever

300
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:11,639
Pineapple Express offers in just its

301
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:13,560
light tur profile yeah yeah so well if

302
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:15,600
it modulates cannaboids what else does

303
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:17,759
it modulate is the is the question right

304
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,879
can it modulate mood I believe of course

305
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:22,120
it can modulate mood that's the entire

306
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:23,639
aroma therapy industry is based on the

307
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:27,278
modulation of mood through the

308
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:31,000
inhalation of of of essential oil Vapors

309
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:33,039
through different um what you find is um

310
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,639
all kinds of plants have found without

311
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:36,679
legs have found their way all around the

312
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:39,519
world just because the tarpine profile

313
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:41,159
they put out controls human beings it

314
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:44,000
controls their noses it controls their

315
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:46,360
memories it's imprinted smell goes as

316
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,879
far back with us as sight to the

317
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:50,800
beginning so you know these plants

318
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:53,120
didn't get around the planet and don't

319
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:55,479
persist even when we want to bulldoze

320
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:58,240
without the power of those tpin Roses we

321
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,600
don't eat but there's a massive industry

322
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,000
off of those light

323
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:05,600
yeah based on our desire tpin are part

324
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:09,639
of human desire to to want those smells

325
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:11,560
and flavors and tastes is is a simple

326
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:14,278
desire of humans and if you read Michael

327
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:16,198
Poland's the botney of Desire that book

328
00:14:14,278 --> 00:14:17,759
really breaks it down in a beautiful way

329
00:14:16,198 --> 00:14:20,039
almost in a way that like nothing would

330
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:22,240
happen if it weren't for human desire

331
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:24,919
absolutely like it literally fires

332
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,440
everything that we do well that's when I

333
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:29,759
got to when I finally isolated this and

334
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:34,040
I'm like is this what the Growers are

335
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:36,560
living with is this how do they even how

336
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:39,919
can they recognize weed when they live

337
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:42,758
in such a pungent aromatically Rich

338
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:45,078
environment that even when the Great

339
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:47,440
Gardener's place is unbelievable how how

340
00:14:45,078 --> 00:14:49,919
stinky it is I'm sure he's numb he must

341
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,839
be numb to it I think that he still

342
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:54,120
smells it but he's definitely slightly

343
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:56,600
numb to it what did you also have some

344
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:58,720
uh lemon oil there yeah we got some

345
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:02,040
Pineapple Express lhu I wanted to check

346
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:04,199
that out as well all right check out all

347
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:07,439
these different things you guys know I'm

348
00:15:04,198 --> 00:15:10,000
not into the oils but uh Horatio uses a

349
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,720
turpine so he's literally making oil

350
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,639
with a

351
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:19,600
turpine a turpine that he produces on

352
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:22,720
his own and and cleans to a degree that

353
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:25,278
um makes this really beautiful nice

354
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:28,600
product so now when you smell that do

355
00:15:25,278 --> 00:15:30,958
you feel you smell the dry weed weed or

356
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,959
the

357
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:38,399
weed well I mean that has a bit of a

358
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:40,239
funk from being in the bag yeah it was a

359
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,559
long date we it was a couple of hours

360
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,720
since we've did actually let's get it

361
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:45,838
out of the bag completely it out and not

362
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:49,720
that one I'll smell the other

363
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,720
one the want I crushed for

364
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,720
science this one's juicy God it is

365
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:58,000
closer to the to the a little closer to

366
00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:00,079
the fresh but the dry has it too it's

367
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,759
different it has text of both of them

368
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:06,519
mhm that's pretty much now that has the

369
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:09,560
tpin reintroduced of that wet experience

370
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:12,159
but with that dry note I basically it's

371
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:13,958
either the lighter component like the

372
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:16,120
the Citrus you smell versus the one you

373
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:20,119
taste and

374
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:22,480
um an interesting

375
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:24,120
texture every strain is different

376
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,319
because if you noticed I can only

377
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:28,639
imagine how wet the tpin from that train

378
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:30,799
wreck we tried would be that would

379
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:33,159
pretty pry much be more of a liquid like

380
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:35,359
that's a pretty much Auto white out even

381
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:36,958
that train wreck I'm like if I had Turf

382
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,560
back to this this thing is a goner it's

383
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:40,119
just going to it's just going to go out

384
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:42,799
in the container but if that's the W

385
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:44,720
that seems pretty stable though yeah I

386
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:47,159
mean every strain is different for

387
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,519
stability this train wreck having more

388
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:51,240
um well it's gooey in the sense that

389
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:52,879
it's not hard and shatter it's it's a

390
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:54,600
little bendable and malleable but it

391
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:57,078
definitely isn't like dripping down the

392
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:59,720
parchment well everybody knows the

393
00:16:57,078 --> 00:17:02,958
luming process removes all the lip and

394
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:05,120
as the current uh myth goes lipids

395
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:07,359
create the structure for Shatter um it's

396
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:10,639
not something I believe but my products

397
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:12,038
always been a softer degree because I

398
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,640
won't smoke those lipids if you're going

399
00:17:12,038 --> 00:17:16,919
to do a non-polar extract you've got to

400
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,640
eliminate those polar components that

401
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:22,000
are not it's not the wax lipids from

402
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,880
something like sift right it's plant

403
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,919
waxes and they're a whole different

404
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:29,200
Beast um at a way higher concentration

405
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:31,160
so this thing is still having had this

406
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,000
thing on in like so

407
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:36,400
long I just feel like I want to take uh

408
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,200
vaporize some of that but the dry herb

409
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,919
yeah maybe I have

410
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:44,640
uh I've always got something within

411
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:46,520
reach maybe this guy yeah cuz I know

412
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,038
great Gardener was talking about well

413
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:51,599
what if I could get

414
00:17:48,038 --> 00:17:53,798
to smoke Frozen bubble in my walk-in

415
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:56,879
freezer I should have the ultimate

416
00:17:53,798 --> 00:17:58,519
experience and I think to a degree but

417
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,919
except for we can't leave the freezer

418
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:01,759
what does he want saying he wants to I

419
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:04,120
remember he was saying to know basically

420
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:06,798
to know the strain to its full degree

421
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:09,000
what if I um I think it was sifted or

422
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:11,158
dobble in a walk-in freezer and be able

423
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,240
to smoke the product so I think it was

424
00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:16,480
just make the bubble and uh cure it out

425
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,359
frozen so it essentially never lost

426
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,200
those tpin okay and I thought well

427
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:23,558
that's interesting except yeah you can't

428
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:26,240
leave the environment um but I'm hoping

429
00:18:23,558 --> 00:18:30,038
that uh there'll be a process for the

430
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:34,599
bud uh for the the sift for the bubble

431
00:18:30,038 --> 00:18:36,759
for the L CH that's all whole and um I'm

432
00:18:34,599 --> 00:18:38,639
not getting the turps from another plant

433
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:40,759
uh the turps come literally from this

434
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,360
dried bud so you know that bud smells

435
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:44,200
good when I broke it up there yeah you

436
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:46,000
know the bud wasn't raped for turps or

437
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:49,519
anything like that so it's getting this

438
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,519
up to 420° my little I guess they call

439
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:54,480
it the herb Titan I don't know uh trippy

440
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:56,759
sticks calls it the herbal unit so

441
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,798
that's what I'm going to call it their

442
00:18:56,759 --> 00:19:02,158
version of it I think it's a

443
00:18:59,798 --> 00:19:04,158
a few companies have a a similar design

444
00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:05,440
but it's so far so good I have to say it

445
00:19:04,159 --> 00:19:08,039
works pretty good looks like it's

446
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,038
heating up

447
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:16,640
fast oh wow get that super medicinal um

448
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:22,600
almost

449
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:22,600
uh what's the word like eucalypticola

450
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:34,119
oh wow no

451
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:42,759
no I don't know you tell me what that

452
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:44,158
is it's really nice sharp almost like

453
00:19:42,759 --> 00:19:46,279
lime

454
00:19:44,159 --> 00:19:48,919
rindes that's pretty

455
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:50,279
lemony it's getting like almost so

456
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:52,840
lemony so that you have to lick your

457
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:54,440
lips to even taste it you know what I

458
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:57,000
mean cuz it comes in like antiseptic

459
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:59,120
this actually PR [ __ ] good this I'm

460
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,599
telling you dude I like it I like that's

461
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:04,079
getting that's that's pretty [ __ ]

462
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:06,439
good that's a turp rip right that's a

463
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:09,359
real [ __ ] no cuz I usually have to

464
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:12,640
wait that's actually it's going that

465
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:15,558
actually tasted really [ __ ] huh so

466
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:17,799
now this becomes my next question is the

467
00:20:15,558 --> 00:20:20,960
drying process that I'm using to get to

468
00:20:17,798 --> 00:20:22,759
bone dry preserving more turps even in

469
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,240
that product while I've stolen turps

470
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:28,079
from it well is this what you call bone

471
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:30,000
dry at this point could get much bone I

472
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:32,240
think it could get this is about 4% I

473
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,640
think it's a little higher but I only

474
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:37,440
guessed that from this and how here's

475
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:39,440
the thing about that though the the hits

476
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,480
that we got I don't want to grind up

477
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,000
over the shatter but I feel like

478
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:45,120
grinding up a bit in my finger to feel

479
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,599
it those that taste though is um there's

480
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:48,719
a little bit of water in there which is

481
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:51,240
key to get that tarpine if you bone it

482
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:53,440
out you'll get these deeper smokier

483
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:54,919
Vapor ribs but you won't get the no it's

484
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,679
the thing is I'm actually I'm cuz the

485
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:59,320
thing is when you meter it you get it at

486
00:20:56,679 --> 00:21:01,919
three about 3% and and then I'm thinking

487
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:05,079
what I where I've kept this Bud since

488
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:07,038
right cuz it does feel this doesn't feel

489
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:08,720
ready to sift if I ask my fingers I

490
00:21:07,038 --> 00:21:10,879
think it's I think it's probably close

491
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,200
to like 6 to

492
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,760
10% just from the way it's like when I

493
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,798
broke it up and stuffed it in here yeah

494
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:19,158
cuz this is still in that smoking range

495
00:21:17,798 --> 00:21:20,720
yeah I think you could roll a joint and

496
00:21:19,159 --> 00:21:22,159
someone would be quite pleased like Remo

497
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,600
who smokes lots of joints I don't think

498
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:26,520
he would tell you that that's too dry no

499
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:28,038
whereas for me when I get ready for to

500
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:30,240
sift something no that's what I'm saying

501
00:21:28,038 --> 00:21:33,240
I'm like I didn't sift this with this

502
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:36,159
particular I pulled this for the dry Bud

503
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:37,679
now like yeah there was dried for

504
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:39,840
smoking I wanted to see if it was an

505
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:41,600
actually good smokable product and

506
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:44,359
that's this handful cuz I didn't think I

507
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:46,319
had that and I found it that makes sense

508
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:50,959
cuz it doesn't feel sift ready I'm still

509
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:53,200
getting um it can still Patty but um

510
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,720
it's fresh I'm pretty excited about this

511
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:58,159
is a drawing technique for the smoke as

512
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:00,240
well um I don't know where it stands

513
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:03,480
when it comes to preservant compared to

514
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:06,159
the different rooms people use but uh as

515
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:09,319
an as an actual industrial

516
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:12,000
process so I hit the bud I hit the dry

517
00:22:09,319 --> 00:22:13,639
sift now everyone's wondering is bubble

518
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:19,079
man going to hit that

519
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:19,080
oil is this oil oil

520
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:26,759
oil little bit of dirty bud I do want I

521
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:29,798
don't vaporize a ton but when I do I get

522
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:32,359
like neurotic about um I just go back to

523
00:22:29,798 --> 00:22:35,720
being the smoker me that just collected

524
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:37,558
Ash for a living and I realize that I'm

525
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:39,519
like why am I collecting this vaporized

526
00:22:37,558 --> 00:22:40,678
nonsense and I'm like I don't know

527
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:42,440
there's just something that tells you

528
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:45,880
you're going to smoke it again we're

529
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:49,360
don't waste it we could make coconut

530
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:51,440
Butters and you could coconut Butters if

531
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:53,918
you're serious about vaping there are

532
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:56,880
medicinal aspects that you could extract

533
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:59,080
into coconut oil um so anyone saving a

534
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,880
mountain of vaporized trash I don't want

535
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:03,278
you Chuck in it yeah don't do that but

536
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:06,159
we're not smoking it don't do that well

537
00:23:03,278 --> 00:23:09,119
let's give this L shot all right let's

538
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:11,640
uh let's do it

539
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:13,599
up do I have it at a good temperature do

540
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,480
you think I should turn it down if you

541
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:19,240
would kindly sir yeah of course if

542
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:21,519
you're the L show guy so I'm not uh now

543
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:23,798
this is quartz So What temperature would

544
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:26,519
you like just drop it to 710 not as low

545
00:23:23,798 --> 00:23:29,000
as that 350 stuff I do sure I think that

546
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:30,558
only works on titanium

547
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I don't think it's needed for quartz

548
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:35,278
perfect we go down to 710 we can always

549
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:39,839
waste it to taste it it's not the end of

550
00:23:35,278 --> 00:23:44,240
the world if can't finish like that yes

551
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:47,480
exactly well I guess I could use this so

552
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:49,679
now cuz that's my my question is cuz I'm

553
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:52,640
big on figuring out a way to introduce

554
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:55,480
this back into the sift what is the co

555
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,120
when how much hash traveled pressed

556
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:59,960
introduce what back into the sift

557
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:02,918
introduce the w TPS that's pretty much

558
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:06,000
the way to call them the wet turps um

559
00:24:02,919 --> 00:24:07,840
but I've never been all my hash came

560
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,880
press press mystery press now there's

561
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:12,038
the new culture of the powder and we run

562
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,600
around with the powder well you know

563
00:24:12,038 --> 00:24:16,200
what and I feel fairly a big part of

564
00:24:14,599 --> 00:24:18,319
that because I always told people like

565
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:20,240
you know like you can see what if you

566
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:22,240
don't have anything to hide then leave

567
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,759
it in powder the only reason you need to

568
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,519
press it well there was two reasons

569
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:28,519
originally why we pressed hash and that

570
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:31,679
was to adulterate to raise the weights

571
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:33,839
with non- glandular material and then to

572
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:37,480
smuggle to move that product over

573
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:39,839
borders across into International zones

574
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:42,679
so we don't really need either of those

575
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:45,639
things in my opinion now and so I think

576
00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:48,320
it's just a matter of uh cuz I keep I'm

577
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:50,278
figuring all my product with that much

578
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:52,639
with basically with this amount of

579
00:24:50,278 --> 00:24:55,839
unstable tpin in it it's going to

580
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,640
everything is going to grease into a new

581
00:24:55,839 --> 00:24:59,158
consistency just press it against the

582
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,840
table

583
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:02,360
I just want to get myself a little rip

584
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:04,798
and it just keeps coming more and more

585
00:25:02,359 --> 00:25:06,959
and more just holding on itself he's not

586
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:08,639
an old oil man folks he doesn't have the

587
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,240
tech did I got the TCH what are you

588
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,559
talking about well you're not sitting

589
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:15,558
there what are you talking about

590
00:25:11,558 --> 00:25:18,839
flapping and it's true definitely

591
00:25:15,558 --> 00:25:22,359
not definitely not but I'm hitting a

592
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:24,599
little bit of my buddy's uh LH no

593
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:26,158
solvents uh well no chemical solvents

594
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:28,439
like BHO no

595
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:30,520
hydrocarbons used in the extraction

596
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:32,880
process so well we better have a little

597
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:32,879
rip of

598
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:38,639
it right temperature yeah

599
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,320
it's very

600
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:11,918
smooth then again I didn't take a

601
00:26:09,038 --> 00:26:14,558
monster rip I think I took you took good

602
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:19,120
that's not my size ABS oh no no you're

603
00:26:14,558 --> 00:26:21,398
good um this that unique everyone has

604
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:23,439
that why is it so smooth mhm I took the

605
00:26:21,398 --> 00:26:25,918
lipids out you don't take those lipids

606
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:28,278
out it gets rougher and rougher now

607
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:31,360
there's many views of what removing Li

608
00:26:28,278 --> 00:26:34,759
lipids are and I'm always been in the

609
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:36,639
gym your air camp and uh Winter Rising

610
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:39,278
is a completely different process than

611
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:41,080
dexing lemine is not even something you

612
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:43,119
can freeze and chill down and try to get

613
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:45,960
waxes out that's a butane only

614
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:47,599
phenomenon but if you go into tped

615
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:50,679
isolation if you go into the molecule

616
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:53,879
world of um essential oil extracts it's

617
00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:55,640
a natural process it CO2 extracts tons

618
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:57,480
of lipids and they have to use a

619
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:59,120
secondary solvent to remove it or it can

620
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,839
be just as

621
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:03,319
they have to use a form of alcohol one

622
00:27:00,839 --> 00:27:05,558
way or another you need a polar to push

623
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:07,558
it out if you don't use some form of

624
00:27:05,558 --> 00:27:09,918
polar you're going to get caught one of

625
00:27:07,558 --> 00:27:12,119
those discs well no what I mean by

626
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:15,559
polarity you literally push the fat if

627
00:27:12,119 --> 00:27:16,839
you don't push fat out of the um nonar

628
00:27:15,558 --> 00:27:18,839
and you just try to separate it with

629
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:21,439
temperature you don't get a complete jum

630
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:24,879
it's not a full profile it's a partial

631
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:26,640
profile of fat removal interesting so uh

632
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,399
well maybe one day we'll be over at

633
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,960
Horatio and we'll end up showing you all

634
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:32,519
this madness that he does in his

635
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:34,159
laboratory uh one day you never know

636
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:35,918
soon enough we're always working it's

637
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:38,840
totally possible but you should hit one

638
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:41,960
of these uh L so I feel like pretty good

639
00:27:38,839 --> 00:27:45,839
I hit the I hit the sift yeah I hit the

640
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:49,200
bud yeah I hit the LH yeah I've got a

641
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:51,199
Pex I wish there was a way to hit

642
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:54,399
weto that's the only thing there's no

643
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,759
way to vape is with a sublimator you can

644
00:27:54,398 --> 00:27:57,038
that would probably you can you can

645
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:58,839
literally put that butt into the

646
00:27:57,038 --> 00:28:00,240
sublimator all turned that would roast

647
00:27:58,839 --> 00:28:02,558
it oh my God I'm telling you would it

648
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,839
work in a volcano um I don't think so

649
00:28:02,558 --> 00:28:06,440
cuz I when I asked people who tried to

650
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:08,678
vaporize wet weed they said I didn't

651
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:11,399
like the coral aspect and I'm like well

652
00:28:08,679 --> 00:28:13,278
of course it's there but it's not the

653
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:15,639
and cuz I always wondered would my water

654
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:18,599
turn green um after extracting the turf

655
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:21,159
which is a stupid concept but um because

656
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:25,240
I pulled that water clean you tried that

657
00:28:21,159 --> 00:28:27,559
water on that last video it uh it's

658
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:29,440
Unique in itself I'm developing a lotion

659
00:28:27,558 --> 00:28:32,639
out of it that hopefully maybe we have

660
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:34,880
to demo by the time my laboratory is

661
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,720
ready for the public see I didn't take

662
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,159
much more than that dude that's all I go

663
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,038
for that's what I'm saying but you said

664
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:42,360
that I took a big one it looked big to

665
00:28:40,038 --> 00:28:44,679
me cuz these dabbers are huge that's a

666
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:46,000
big hit is all I'm saying it is I'm

667
00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:48,679
going to choke out where you probably

668
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:52,720
won't well whatever I don't think it's a

669
00:28:48,679 --> 00:28:52,720
contest I'm choking out on my own

670
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:59,519
[ __ ] I'll tell everyone Horatio was so

671
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:01,000
wasted on his own [ __ ]

672
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:03,278
first we hit the

673
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
sift then we hit the bud although you

674
00:29:03,278 --> 00:29:07,398
only really got one taste feel free if

675
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:10,000
you feel the urge to taste take more uh

676
00:29:07,398 --> 00:29:13,119
rips on the well I actually is that

677
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:16,359
product in the stores yet yeah yeah yeah

678
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:18,278
I know um I have now got a collection of

679
00:29:16,359 --> 00:29:20,398
itty bitty baggies like this but I don't

680
00:29:18,278 --> 00:29:22,119
enjoy them cuz I've always I'm like well

681
00:29:20,398 --> 00:29:24,158
I'll just roll one up since I'm watching

682
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:25,278
Dr Green Thumb and then I'm like two

683
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:27,679
hits I don't know what to do with this

684
00:29:25,278 --> 00:29:28,798
thing um I was just in the mood but I

685
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:32,038
like

686
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:34,839
just puff that in like 3 minutes easy

687
00:29:32,038 --> 00:29:36,158
you just be puffed yeah poof I'm like

688
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:38,839
Remo you are a

689
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:42,159
fiend I did like that I actually got

690
00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:45,319
probably the best fate taste how much is

691
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:48,760
it how much is what these in stores do

692
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:52,119
you know these what these oh those 100

693
00:29:48,759 --> 00:29:55,798
bucks okay they 100 bucks yeah sure you

694
00:29:52,119 --> 00:29:58,479
a better price I just I have so many one

695
00:29:55,798 --> 00:30:00,720
time all right I don't really want this

696
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,759
well I'll tell you I got it and once

697
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,159
again I I was like I don't think I need

698
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:05,398
this thing and then I stuffed it and I

699
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:07,080
used it once and I was like w this

700
00:30:05,398 --> 00:30:08,479
thing's pretty good all of a sudden all

701
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:10,038
the bud that people have been giving me

702
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,519
over the last 6 months that I've got

703
00:30:10,038 --> 00:30:14,398
stashed I started taking it out started

704
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:16,640
enjoying it and I thought man I'll tell

705
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:18,199
you if that thing can offer that to me

706
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,720
so how do I load it up let's do this

707
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:25,519
again you pop the top off

708
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:29,519
yeah dump the herb dump his herbs and

709
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:32,599
then just break some herbs I

710
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:35,319
put that over there end the T then I'll

711
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:36,519
clean this a little bit for you this one

712
00:30:35,319 --> 00:30:38,960
there's a screen right there on the

713
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:41,679
bottom the piece that screws on which I

714
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:44,798
like this piece also screws off so you

715
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:47,038
can clean the screen yeah cuz I'm I

716
00:30:44,798 --> 00:30:48,679
noticed the ones that drove me crazy

717
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:50,879
were the ones where I couldn't reload it

718
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:52,320
while I was walking to the transit yeah

719
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,320
well that's definitely a Reload while

720
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:58,158
you're yeah cuz it's got the just grind

721
00:30:54,319 --> 00:31:00,398
me up above yep all right stuffing this

722
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:03,240
that's the

723
00:31:00,398 --> 00:31:06,319
one oh yeah I am happy with how that

724
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:09,120
dried I never I basically I forgot I had

725
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:11,319
that so I only really smelling it today

726
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:13,719
all right it pops on easy push the big

727
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:15,918
oval button five times 1 two three four

728
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:17,880
five did it turn on yep okay hold it

729
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:20,919
down for 4

730
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:23,720
seconds okay yeah and then it'll go up

731
00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:26,960
to 420° which I've been finding I was

732
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:28,558
doing 380 and it was just too light 420

733
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,038
seems to be the perfect temperature to

734
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:33,319
actually get it to a point where you get

735
00:31:30,038 --> 00:31:35,119
that perfect Vapor rip and not burnt by

736
00:31:33,319 --> 00:31:37,638
any means as you

737
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:41,359
no it was I didn't expect that I

738
00:31:37,638 --> 00:31:43,398
expected The herbal hit I didn't expect

739
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:45,038
um a tur rip it's pretty good little

740
00:31:43,398 --> 00:31:46,398
unit I'm not going to lie trippy sticks

741
00:31:45,038 --> 00:31:48,679
they also sent me these which are

742
00:31:46,398 --> 00:31:51,479
awesome they sent me like a bunch of uh

743
00:31:48,679 --> 00:31:53,679
trippy wipes alcohol yeah but like you

744
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:55,319
know these full like three or four of

745
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:58,679
them

746
00:31:55,319 --> 00:32:03,079
so thanks H uh uh

747
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:05,440
alilio Horatio alelo guys with your wild

748
00:32:03,079 --> 00:32:08,158
names I've just got the classical

749
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,679
Biblical name it's all on our mothers I

750
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:11,559
would start hitting it right now right

751
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:14,559
around 400 is where yeah you'll get like

752
00:32:11,558 --> 00:32:16,319
3 390 to 420 is just you get this really

753
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:18,480
you have to push the button no I didn't

754
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:21,079
think push the button no but you'll

755
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:24,319
already be getting some tasty ribs just

756
00:32:21,079 --> 00:32:26,720
those light antiseptic

757
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:29,119
Tarpin yeah no no that remember when I

758
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:31,880
said the alcohol remember that alcohol

759
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:34,638
fraction I feel like that's where the

760
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:36,200
this part of the hit went yes for sure

761
00:32:34,638 --> 00:32:37,240
it's I think of it when I clean when I

762
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:40,278
take the hit I think like you could

763
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:41,880
clean a hospital room with this smell m

764
00:32:40,278 --> 00:32:45,038
whatever this is like how's that a way

765
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:47,799
to antip antiseptic a whole room where

766
00:32:45,038 --> 00:32:49,798
you just have this crazy intense just

767
00:32:47,798 --> 00:32:52,879
basically put the G put the Turing on

768
00:32:49,798 --> 00:32:54,200
the atomizer and fog it out yep that's I

769
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:57,080
like it we're coming up with good ideas

770
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:59,360
here all the time yeah no this reminds

771
00:32:57,079 --> 00:33:01,839
me most of the the alcohol portion the

772
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:07,479
portion that was the whitest and the

773
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:10,278
most yikes and it's good it's very

774
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:13,038
good that's I'm pretty I still have my

775
00:33:10,278 --> 00:33:14,919
solo here from arer which ariser which

776
00:33:13,038 --> 00:33:17,359
was a unit that I used for the longest

777
00:33:14,919 --> 00:33:20,240
time but you can tell between these two

778
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:23,319
units it's got that pocket you know this

779
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:25,440
this is just too con damn convenient

780
00:33:23,319 --> 00:33:28,918
this is more the home yeah this is for

781
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:32,519
home um but the reason why vaporizing is

782
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:34,759
to Quality Control an essay yeah I love

783
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:37,278
the fact that this is in glass but yet

784
00:33:34,759 --> 00:33:39,720
this does not hit like it's in a metal

785
00:33:37,278 --> 00:33:40,919
container well and someone else told me

786
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,679
they were like oh that thing has a

787
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:44,799
rubber thing and it tastes super bad and

788
00:33:42,679 --> 00:33:47,399
I was like I don't taste like I'm pretty

789
00:33:44,798 --> 00:33:49,398
OCD and I'm not going to lie like if I

790
00:33:47,398 --> 00:33:51,439
PL taste plastic or I taste something I

791
00:33:49,398 --> 00:33:53,319
don't like no I know that's kind of why

792
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,960
I'm looking at the construction to go

793
00:33:53,319 --> 00:33:56,558
why do I think it's made out of one

794
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,720
thing but it behaves like another

795
00:33:56,558 --> 00:34:02,599
because look the red is one thing but

796
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:04,798
look inside see this black here and here

797
00:34:02,599 --> 00:34:06,558
that's the whole heating chamber that

798
00:34:04,798 --> 00:34:08,918
you see in there so this piece probably

799
00:34:06,558 --> 00:34:11,199
pulls right out probably goes to like

800
00:34:08,918 --> 00:34:13,118
here this is made out of the same stuff

801
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:15,078
my vaporizer mouth piece is made out of

802
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:16,838
why I don't get bur to the mouth pretty

803
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:18,280
much that's a pretty good unit anyway I

804
00:34:16,838 --> 00:34:21,039
can't say enough about it so far it's

805
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:22,960
been really travel friendly and it's

806
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:24,719
worked every time I've needed it and one

807
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:27,280
thing I really like about it is it just

808
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:28,918
it doesn't just die super fast yeah

809
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,919
which that drives me [ __ ] nuts with

810
00:34:28,918 --> 00:34:32,000
some of these

811
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:33,319
units you know you hit the button three

812
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,358
times and all of a sudden it's blinking

813
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:39,320
cuz it's dead that's where Apex really

814
00:34:36,358 --> 00:34:42,078
came in holy Christ with the five day

815
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:44,000
this is a five day battery from Apex

816
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:46,159
these guys no they put basically they

817
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,119
put the real batteries in the units they

818
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:50,159
they use what I Ed bird did it up he

819
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:53,119
really took the pen to the next level

820
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:55,919
and created the Apex pen in my mind is

821
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:58,640
not like a vapor pen of any sort it's

822
00:34:55,918 --> 00:35:01,879
more like a comparable it's the battery

823
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:04,358
power to feed the experience I mean yes

824
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:06,680
the same reason why the sublimator is

825
00:35:04,358 --> 00:35:10,078
borderline dangerous but it creates such

826
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:12,639
a borderline smoking experience yep all

827
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:15,440
sorts of different heads here so I could

828
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:15,440
do something like

829
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:22,239
this and

830
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:23,639
then I don't know I guess I need that

831
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:27,039
might be able to

832
00:35:23,639 --> 00:35:29,239
like you know get that into there so now

833
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:32,639
you just push this button yeah and you

834
00:35:29,239 --> 00:35:34,719
can take these crazy insane rips through

835
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:38,039
that so that's another little fun toy so

836
00:35:34,719 --> 00:35:40,078
many fun toys to try out here but uh you

837
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:42,639
know what I had awesome little taster

838
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:44,480
test there um next time we're sorry we

839
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:46,118
did he did forget the little tpin we

840
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:48,559
were going to smell the tpin as well as

841
00:35:46,119 --> 00:35:52,240
the fresh Bud the wet Bud the dry sift

842
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:55,358
the L I can honestly say this as well um

843
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:58,118
I definitely smell the slightest Orange

844
00:35:55,358 --> 00:36:00,440
in this but it's by far the least I've

845
00:35:58,119 --> 00:36:03,838
ever smelled in any product that you've

846
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:07,159
had and it didn't really overwhelm me in

847
00:36:03,838 --> 00:36:12,358
the taste it still tasted substantially

848
00:36:07,159 --> 00:36:14,639
like this the but I just finished smell

849
00:36:12,358 --> 00:36:16,679
that can you smell the orange Citrus

850
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:19,000
smell in there I remember that diesel

851
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:22,559
cuz I remember smelling it and I'm like

852
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:25,318
this has got that this candied orange

853
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:28,519
this had a slight like a a slight

854
00:36:25,318 --> 00:36:30,920
candied orange uh addition to the the

855
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:33,318
Pineapple Express which I didn't get off

856
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:35,920
the sift or the bud but I still smell

857
00:36:33,318 --> 00:36:38,279
the tasted the flavor of this and this

858
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:41,760
in here which was it's pretty wild when

859
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:45,440
you think about it like he's using tpin

860
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:49,440
a turpine to extract resin it's a pretty

861
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:51,400
neat concept and one day if we can um

862
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,880
turn all of these turpins instead of

863
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:57,639
just into a single turpine profile which

864
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:59,760
is what um Horatio and uh Tony are doing

865
00:36:57,639 --> 00:37:01,838
at this point K's taking it to the next

866
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:04,280
level and he's fractioning them into

867
00:37:01,838 --> 00:37:05,920
individual tpin I don't believe he's

868
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:07,839
fractioned all of them at this point in

869
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:11,480
time but when we can fraction them into

870
00:37:07,838 --> 00:37:13,799
their two to 300 plus varieties of

871
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:15,760
Tarpin that are present in

872
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:18,280
cannabis um I think it's just going to

873
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:20,200
be an incredible way to come up with new

874
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:22,920
ways to do things much like what you're

875
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:25,879
doing with delimiting it gets it's I

876
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:28,159
mean even when you look at well what if

877
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:31,280
we split it off and I'm like

878
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:33,318
I'm so look it's scary because we could

879
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:36,160
do 20 years of just chasing these

880
00:37:33,318 --> 00:37:37,440
strains and the missing components and

881
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:40,318
then you have people who are going to be

882
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:42,200
able to isolate and say well let's up we

883
00:37:40,318 --> 00:37:43,880
lost this strain but we know the

884
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:46,879
difference between what we have and what

885
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:48,519
it was was this tpine and that's when it

886
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:52,240
worked well that's it I want to be able

887
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:54,239
to recognize on graphs or in like with

888
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:56,479
the names of tpin and the percentages of

889
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:58,799
tpin it's going to be graphs I want to

890
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:00,559
be able to recognize like that's Haze

891
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:03,000
that's road kill skunk that's super

892
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:05,920
fruity that's blueberry that's warlock

893
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:10,159
that's God bud that's I the one thing

894
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:14,240
that because until we can homogenize

895
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:17,920
Growers I've found too much data of how

896
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:19,919
easily I can manipulate the dry SI right

897
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,760
in the grow and I'm like if it's in the

898
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,720
heads forget the plant material forget

899
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:26,040
wood forget everything else that comes

900
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:28,239
with which always had to do with [ __ ]

901
00:38:26,039 --> 00:38:29,440
with Bud for its own s

902
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:32,039
if

903
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:36,039
smells get heads it'll be trapped in the

904
00:38:32,039 --> 00:38:38,838
chlh material when I see suar is being

905
00:38:36,039 --> 00:38:40,599
uptake from Salt products that's when I

906
00:38:38,838 --> 00:38:42,440
get worried I'm like if we follow the

907
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:44,720
wrong tpine profiles if everything

908
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:47,960
tested was tested have you seen salts

909
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:51,519
invade the heads I seen sugars carry

910
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:53,838
over that are unnatural yeah absolutely

911
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:56,079
unnatural and to the point of distorting

912
00:38:53,838 --> 00:38:58,279
the tpine profile completely and like

913
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:00,960
tasting bad or just no tasting like pure

914
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:03,200
sugar like literally like candy huh

915
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:05,199
that's interesting absolutely artificial

916
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:08,559
candy to the point of losing that

917
00:39:05,199 --> 00:39:11,399
medicinal antiseptic aspect that's when

918
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:13,960
I I started to go well this doesn't

919
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:15,599
really that's not that's not like just a

920
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:18,358
a strain thing that you think that

921
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:20,680
that's a food regimen thing no because

922
00:39:18,358 --> 00:39:23,318
I've now been able I just went through

923
00:39:20,679 --> 00:39:26,000
organic versus inorganic and uh seeing

924
00:39:23,318 --> 00:39:27,838
the actual result off the same clone and

925
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,800
now I have two different Growers who

926
00:39:27,838 --> 00:39:33,119
produced a train wreck and um the

927
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:35,359
problem was every other strain this one

928
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:37,240
grower produced had the persistent

929
00:39:35,358 --> 00:39:39,679
sucrose effect but what if he was

930
00:39:37,239 --> 00:39:41,959
spraying that plant with something while

931
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:43,879
it was in flow that to me is the only

932
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:46,720
way that it I just don't believe that

933
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:48,920
this the plant the tricomb could pull it

934
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:51,159
out of the plant matter into the head

935
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:53,000
you well I don't understand I think more

936
00:39:51,159 --> 00:39:55,078
like strings that produce natural sweet

937
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,800
taste why couldn't that be enhanced for

938
00:39:55,079 --> 00:39:58,640
sure I can [ __ ] with the bricks level

939
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:01,640
spraying with

940
00:39:58,639 --> 00:40:04,318
this is not these colada flushes and

941
00:40:01,639 --> 00:40:05,679
stuff like I'm not talking about that

942
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:07,559
I'll tell you one thing when it comes to

943
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:09,559
the growing aspect of testing you can

944
00:40:07,559 --> 00:40:11,159
only really ever trust yourself you have

945
00:40:09,559 --> 00:40:12,920
to almost be in control of that to know

946
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:15,078
that your science is solid well this is

947
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:16,358
what I looked at I'm like what do you do

948
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:18,599
different and they're like I use

949
00:40:16,358 --> 00:40:20,880
finisher and I'm like what's finisher

950
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:23,440
it's a bulking agent what does it bulk

951
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:25,960
with it promises sweetener so it

952
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:27,599
promises that it can bulk with sugar I

953
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:30,039
know how to do that to an orange General

954
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:32,318
how you add to a potato I know this art

955
00:40:30,039 --> 00:40:34,000
for from add once you're adding messy

956
00:40:32,318 --> 00:40:35,599
things into your plants yeah that's just

957
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,559
mocked up that's as bad as spraying your

958
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:39,400
plant that's like finishing it that's

959
00:40:37,559 --> 00:40:42,559
what I mean that's kind of what I mean

960
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:45,039
I'm basically shedding light on if it's

961
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:47,719
in if I'm finding that flavor in this

962
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:49,279
head that means it's what you're looking

963
00:40:47,719 --> 00:40:51,799
for what stimulates the actual

964
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,960
production of T and the mix phenols and

965
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:56,200
tpin well now I'm saying I know a

966
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:58,440
product that is negatively able to

967
00:40:56,199 --> 00:41:00,639
influence that now is there a positive

968
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:01,880
side is but nobody does know a product

969
00:41:00,639 --> 00:41:03,440
they don't even know it's phenols and

970
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:05,318
Tarpin that are producing all the

971
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:08,440
cannabinoids that are producing all the

972
00:41:05,318 --> 00:41:11,358
tpin they have most people have no idea

973
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:13,119
of that simple scientific fact they just

974
00:41:11,358 --> 00:41:15,000
know it works and I get so that's why

975
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:16,119
when I I always say I said it to Remo

976
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,920
the other day I said listen if you're

977
00:41:16,119 --> 00:41:19,358
doing a nutrient company and you end up

978
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:22,519
with a lab and some

979
00:41:19,358 --> 00:41:25,199
scientists get them to look into how

980
00:41:22,519 --> 00:41:27,480
canabo are cooked into existence inside

981
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:28,960
the glandular triome head because if you

982
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:30,760
guys can start understanding that

983
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:33,519
relationship of how the phenols and the

984
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:37,160
tpin are produced in these organal these

985
00:41:33,519 --> 00:41:39,000
vacs and plastids and push upwards if if

986
00:41:37,159 --> 00:41:40,598
we can figure out why and how that's

987
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,679
happening you might actually be able to

988
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:44,880
feed the plant that gives it what it

989
00:41:42,679 --> 00:41:47,279
needs to produce a higher concentration

990
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:50,119
of phenols and tpin which then produce

991
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:52,079
all the canono so that would be but

992
00:41:50,119 --> 00:41:54,599
people don't know that well I cuz I'm

993
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:56,760
taking my agricultural background and

994
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:58,720
looking at it and going wait a minute I

995
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:00,880
could never never feed a field full of

996
00:41:58,719 --> 00:42:03,118
oranges enough sugar to plump up the

997
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:07,039
oranges with sugar sugar doesn't come

998
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:09,400
from sugar but you can precursors though

999
00:42:07,039 --> 00:42:11,639
but I remember from a child if I can

1000
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:14,519
feed my yellow canary carrots and change

1001
00:42:11,639 --> 00:42:16,799
the pigment in its feathers right yeah

1002
00:42:14,519 --> 00:42:18,759
then I don't see any reason why the

1003
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,559
sweetening agents don't persist

1004
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:23,000
especially when when you read the bottle

1005
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:25,680
label they say this grape flavors is to

1006
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,679
enhance the flavor of grape and I'm like

1007
00:42:25,679 --> 00:42:29,519
but we don't grow grapes here

1008
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:31,279
what is it doing here it's clearly to

1009
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:33,000
either because I've seen people make the

1010
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:35,240
not oh no we don't use the grape flavor

1011
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,599
on our OG that would be a mistake and

1012
00:42:35,239 --> 00:42:37,959
I'm like well then you clearly

1013
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:41,119
acknowledge that you just don't want to

1014
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:44,079
mix the wrong flavor but you definitely

1015
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:46,280
support that so in a more not the

1016
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:48,519
bastard end I don't think people

1017
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:50,119
realize there's no point in the natural

1018
00:42:48,519 --> 00:42:51,880
fall season where sugar just magically

1019
00:42:50,119 --> 00:42:54,880
appears in the soil for a plant to

1020
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:56,559
uptake and unfortunately it gives a

1021
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:59,318
pleasant result but I'm looking for

1022
00:42:56,559 --> 00:43:02,319
medicine so I find the more antiseptic

1023
00:42:59,318 --> 00:43:04,440
the more wild the turpe profile the more

1024
00:43:02,318 --> 00:43:07,279
chance it's going to be a real

1025
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:09,240
experience rather than a sugar bear I

1026
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:13,400
think the easiest way for us to get into

1027
00:43:09,239 --> 00:43:15,759
the new um the next 5 to 10 years of

1028
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:18,119
tpine profiles that we're going to find

1029
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:20,480
is to get into strains that do not

1030
00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:22,760
produce large amounts and take a long

1031
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:24,440
time to flour cuz that's what mostly

1032
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:26,240
everyone's avoiding right now so that's

1033
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:28,559
where you're going to find things that

1034
00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:30,799
will have you the thing is that is so

1035
00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:33,200
true in so many other Industries there

1036
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:36,079
is standard pump and out lavender oil

1037
00:43:33,199 --> 00:43:40,118
then there's Mediterranean long summer

1038
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:42,760
dry Coastal season and that stuff I only

1039
00:43:40,119 --> 00:43:44,039
focus on if I want to be the best I want

1040
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:45,640
to focus on the best what's the

1041
00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:47,838
complexities and subtleties I need to

1042
00:43:45,639 --> 00:43:49,480
know so French have the bomb lavender

1043
00:43:47,838 --> 00:43:51,759
well I mean the thing is the French have

1044
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:54,199
a natural condition we need to study and

1045
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:56,599
emulate it's as simple as that so I'm

1046
00:43:54,199 --> 00:43:58,679
like if I know this person admitted the

1047
00:43:56,599 --> 00:44:01,039
only different between them and all the

1048
00:43:58,679 --> 00:44:04,000
other Growers is this product and I read

1049
00:44:01,039 --> 00:44:06,558
the product and it says I contain masses

1050
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:09,039
and I contain magnesium sulfate which is

1051
00:44:06,559 --> 00:44:12,599
epson salt I mean I believe it could get

1052
00:44:09,039 --> 00:44:14,440
into the into the um the plant uh the

1053
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:16,920
leaf and stuff it's just like wow if

1054
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:19,000
it's getting up into the Tricom head

1055
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:21,000
when I could taste it then I started I'm

1056
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,599
like this is an abnormal amount of sugar

1057
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:25,719
for train wreck train wreck is supposed

1058
00:44:22,599 --> 00:44:28,838
to be a very medicinal strain not really

1059
00:44:25,719 --> 00:44:30,919
as much for fun but for effect and this

1060
00:44:28,838 --> 00:44:34,639
just tastes like a Candy Land Experience

1061
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:36,639
a train wreck so I started asking I just

1062
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:38,199
asked hey is there anything you know

1063
00:44:36,639 --> 00:44:40,480
that they did different than you do

1064
00:44:38,199 --> 00:44:41,919
different and they asked and asked hey

1065
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:43,318
do you know do you know and then I

1066
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:46,039
looked at the product and I'm like okay

1067
00:44:43,318 --> 00:44:48,119
I understand the point of the salt is to

1068
00:44:46,039 --> 00:44:51,558
bind the sugar into the plant to raise

1069
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:53,079
its bricks level I use a refractor meter

1070
00:44:51,559 --> 00:44:55,720
press the plant how much sugar do you

1071
00:44:53,079 --> 00:44:57,318
contain this is a we read this to

1072
00:44:55,719 --> 00:44:59,239
project how much sugar will it be the

1073
00:44:57,318 --> 00:45:02,440
fruit right this is the fruit of that

1074
00:44:59,239 --> 00:45:05,318
plant so they load that plant with sugar

1075
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:07,119
and it doesn't flush but it's not

1076
00:45:05,318 --> 00:45:09,639
something that negatively affects burn

1077
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:12,200
so how would we know it's just you have

1078
00:45:09,639 --> 00:45:14,799
to test it that's thing is I really want

1079
00:45:12,199 --> 00:45:18,919
to test content in there well you taste

1080
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:21,760
it I know by that same C wanting to

1081
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:24,440
break down it it's more like honey than

1082
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:26,280
ever and um I've never had that on

1083
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:28,559
streams that are well testing into the

1084
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:31,280
GC would really tell you yeah I what I

1085
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:33,359
really would like to see is no sugar

1086
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:37,160
added how much sugar could you add how

1087
00:45:33,358 --> 00:45:38,679
much sugar is there on the GC okay well

1088
00:45:37,159 --> 00:45:40,879
give me a strain that hasn't had no

1089
00:45:38,679 --> 00:45:43,000
sugar added it produces tons of sugar

1090
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:44,599
what does it eat I want to that's the

1091
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,920
ideal thing you get your greenhouse and

1092
00:45:44,599 --> 00:45:47,519
you're just growing all these different

1093
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:49,119
varieties in three different ways from

1094
00:45:47,519 --> 00:45:51,920
Tuesday and then you're doing like these

1095
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:53,760
tests where you can truly not just

1096
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:55,400
control the extraction process but

1097
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:57,200
control exactly you don't have to have

1098
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:59,720
anyone's word or trust of what they

1099
00:45:57,199 --> 00:46:02,960
sprayed or didn't spray on it ex well

1100
00:45:59,719 --> 00:46:05,679
now that I taste it I'm like whoa now I

1101
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:08,318
ask a ton of questions now I read every

1102
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:11,279
bottle now I if you're in a position to

1103
00:46:08,318 --> 00:46:15,558
interact with your designated uh grower

1104
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:17,319
um one last one for the you bet so it's

1105
00:46:15,559 --> 00:46:19,200
that's kind of what's exciting it it

1106
00:46:17,318 --> 00:46:23,279
sounds like a bad thing but Sugar's not

1107
00:46:19,199 --> 00:46:25,239
going to kill us in one uh rip no but uh

1108
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:27,359
knowing that tells me I can go in the

1109
00:46:25,239 --> 00:46:30,159
opposite direction and find a new

1110
00:46:27,358 --> 00:46:31,838
Paradigm for the plant so I still

1111
00:46:30,159 --> 00:46:33,639
believe for all the potential

1112
00:46:31,838 --> 00:46:35,519
marijuana's offered us we've never

1113
00:46:33,639 --> 00:46:37,920
offered marijuana the perfect grow other

1114
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:40,079
than random outdoor instances where it

1115
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:42,318
got everything it needed the swore was

1116
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:45,480
what it wanted just like I just keep

1117
00:46:42,318 --> 00:46:47,800
thinking about red volcanic soils

1118
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:50,480
cannabis perfect drainage and the

1119
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:51,960
strains that are desert Hardy and hard

1120
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:53,838
to grow and indoor environments with

1121
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:55,519
high humidity that's exactly what

1122
00:46:53,838 --> 00:46:58,440
Jamaica is built for in the mountains

1123
00:46:55,519 --> 00:47:00,159
were in the Flatlands it's a whole

1124
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:02,960
different soil and a whole different

1125
00:47:00,159 --> 00:47:05,078
plan so I sorry I brought up Jamaica but

1126
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:09,240
I just literally saw it in my mind where

1127
00:47:05,079 --> 00:47:10,920
I've traveled and uh how coffee behaves

1128
00:47:09,239 --> 00:47:13,078
and how you get your different grades of

1129
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:17,240
coffee just by changing

1130
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:20,200
altitudes the uh amount of uh well you

1131
00:47:17,239 --> 00:47:23,679
just imagine that high altitude cush

1132
00:47:20,199 --> 00:47:25,919
versus low altitude cush yep different

1133
00:47:23,679 --> 00:47:29,000
and then you find out that high altitude

1134
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:30,440
is producing a one in a million turine

1135
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:33,519
that

1136
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:36,240
is whatever for whatever condition we

1137
00:47:33,519 --> 00:47:37,719
every day we're finding out more I think

1138
00:47:36,239 --> 00:47:39,399
someone sent me an article that the

1139
00:47:37,719 --> 00:47:41,239
liver has tpine receptors looking for

1140
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:44,880
citronella and I'm like why are you

1141
00:47:41,239 --> 00:47:47,279
smelling for citrus and anti-cancerous

1142
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:49,720
properties and I'm like really a key

1143
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:51,720
there your liver is sniffing and

1144
00:47:49,719 --> 00:47:54,838
controlling your behavior to see those

1145
00:47:51,719 --> 00:47:57,639
terms so uh unbelievable man just like

1146
00:47:54,838 --> 00:48:01,400
the science on us as we know more about

1147
00:47:57,639 --> 00:48:03,879
how we're run um we'll run to the things

1148
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:05,480
that work best so it's going to be

1149
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:08,039
pretty exciting next five to 10 years

1150
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:09,838
let's just say that much definitely

1151
00:48:08,039 --> 00:48:13,039
definitely definitely and a lot of

1152
00:48:09,838 --> 00:48:16,480
exciting characters seem to be falling

1153
00:48:13,039 --> 00:48:18,159
with the right crowd to survive um

1154
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:20,559
instead of going for the short-term

1155
00:48:18,159 --> 00:48:22,159
product realizing when the government's

1156
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:24,200
really start to pay attention when

1157
00:48:22,159 --> 00:48:27,039
pharmaceutical companies try to take it

1158
00:48:24,199 --> 00:48:29,039
all and legislate us out you what felt

1159
00:48:27,039 --> 00:48:31,558
the same way like I just got I it's been

1160
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:34,239
only about I guess it's only been about

1161
00:48:31,559 --> 00:48:37,160
a year since I've been applied for a

1162
00:48:34,239 --> 00:48:39,439
license or been waiting for a license in

1163
00:48:37,159 --> 00:48:42,440
Jamaica maybe even less like six months

1164
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:44,440
yeah and I just you know I it's

1165
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:46,440
obviously been 25 years of my life in

1166
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:49,240
the Cannabis activism and the Cannabis

1167
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:51,280
world before that but uh yeah I just

1168
00:48:49,239 --> 00:48:52,679
felt like when I saw that it was

1169
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:54,079
happening I thought man like the people

1170
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:55,838
that are getting involved better be

1171
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:57,519
really good people like I just felt like

1172
00:48:55,838 --> 00:49:00,358
kind of protective

1173
00:48:57,519 --> 00:49:02,920
of of cannabis and of Jamaica you can um

1174
00:49:00,358 --> 00:49:04,558
you can imagine my perspective I don't

1175
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:08,000
emphasize the subject but I'm clearly

1176
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:11,400
Jamaican and I can only conceive I'm

1177
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:14,239
like what if J LH was a Jamaican product

1178
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:15,960
through and through be pretty cool I'd

1179
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:19,078
be pretty satisfied to go home like you

1180
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:21,838
plant oranges specifically for it

1181
00:49:19,079 --> 00:49:23,839
there's already oranges Wai to get the

1182
00:49:21,838 --> 00:49:25,838
thing is I just look at I'm like there's

1183
00:49:23,838 --> 00:49:28,519
new money in your oranges is the orange

1184
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:32,199
industry dying you know I want your RS

1185
00:49:28,519 --> 00:49:33,880
yeah and come work with me and develop

1186
00:49:32,199 --> 00:49:35,159
this develop that I want you to grow

1187
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:37,119
this with your oranges and you'll

1188
00:49:35,159 --> 00:49:39,759
actually produce better tpin a higher

1189
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:42,720
percentage of lemine versus the other T

1190
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:45,640
and uh you know I don't tend to be

1191
00:49:42,719 --> 00:49:47,679
nationalistic publicly but um as I've

1192
00:49:45,639 --> 00:49:50,440
developed in my own process to something

1193
00:49:47,679 --> 00:49:53,118
that is uh competitive market

1194
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:55,480
alternative to hydrocarbons for large

1195
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:58,440
scale production of medicine um and its

1196
00:49:55,480 --> 00:50:00,240
extraction I'm not really concerned with

1197
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:02,200
what you're going to dab in the future

1198
00:50:00,239 --> 00:50:04,558
I'm concerned with the thousands of

1199
00:50:02,199 --> 00:50:06,239
pounds of the invisible products that

1200
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:07,839
are not for recreational smoking that

1201
00:50:06,239 --> 00:50:10,639
are going to be produced I don't want to

1202
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:12,199
rub on something that has the frequency

1203
00:50:10,639 --> 00:50:13,480
even if you if you're a spiritual person

1204
00:50:12,199 --> 00:50:15,960
if you look at things that as

1205
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:17,719
frequencies I don't want that vibration

1206
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:20,318
going through and adulterating my

1207
00:50:17,719 --> 00:50:23,118
medicine on a level I can't prove I hear

1208
00:50:20,318 --> 00:50:25,039
but I feel it and I know it so it's the

1209
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:26,920
derivatives that people are really going

1210
00:50:25,039 --> 00:50:28,400
to be counting on to save their Liv

1211
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:31,639
that's where the hope is in the creams

1212
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:33,400
and the medicines and the orals um I

1213
00:50:31,639 --> 00:50:35,480
make a product that's competitive

1214
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:37,400
recreationally and I'm proud of it um

1215
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:40,159
we're all smokers and we all like to you

1216
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:43,200
know be purist but uh at the end of the

1217
00:50:40,159 --> 00:50:46,399
day if uh a bunch if basically if

1218
00:50:43,199 --> 00:50:49,118
arthritis which is afflicting many of us

1219
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:51,599
if even just in Jamaica milons that was

1220
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:54,240
a simple give back program where oh my

1221
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:56,200
God I managed to isolate develop I found

1222
00:50:54,239 --> 00:50:58,519
a tpine that punctures right through the

1223
00:50:56,199 --> 00:51:01,078
skin and gives relief and I'm giving it

1224
00:50:58,519 --> 00:51:03,079
away it's way further than what I could

1225
00:51:01,079 --> 00:51:05,400
imagine if I'd have gone to med school

1226
00:51:03,079 --> 00:51:08,119
well you know that uh the second that

1227
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:10,599
crd can acquire a license in Jamaica

1228
00:51:08,119 --> 00:51:13,240
will definitely be uh calling you up a

1229
00:51:10,599 --> 00:51:15,920
ratio it'll be exciting times to go home

1230
00:51:13,239 --> 00:51:18,838
yeah it will be absolutely taking the LI

1231
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:20,880
the limitting to uh to the next level

1232
00:51:18,838 --> 00:51:24,078
and of course the dry sifts and the wet

1233
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:25,760
washes and uh even gide up I believe is

1234
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:28,880
uh going to be down there so that'll be

1235
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:31,079
a big project if that can get off the

1236
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:33,039
ground and we're just you know waiting

1237
00:51:31,079 --> 00:51:37,039
every day we hear new news from Jamaica

1238
00:51:33,039 --> 00:51:39,159
that the cabinet is is is is arguing the

1239
00:51:37,039 --> 00:51:40,880
the debating the the facts and I guess

1240
00:51:39,159 --> 00:51:43,598
they're both both parties it's

1241
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:45,838
bipartisan they're both um everybody's

1242
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:48,359
on board it's literally like the amount

1243
00:51:45,838 --> 00:51:49,920
of things they never thought well we got

1244
00:51:48,358 --> 00:51:52,598
to give licenses for tourism well we got

1245
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:54,599
to designate yeah there could be Resorts

1246
00:51:52,599 --> 00:51:57,240
it's basically it's overwhelming the

1247
00:51:54,599 --> 00:51:59,119
amount of subtleties to actually make it

1248
00:51:57,239 --> 00:52:01,798
and I'm like yeah licenses to grow

1249
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:04,200
licenses for tourist attraction loues

1250
00:52:01,798 --> 00:52:06,719
spaces designated smoking nonsmoking

1251
00:52:04,199 --> 00:52:09,118
beaches it's what people have dreamed of

1252
00:52:06,719 --> 00:52:11,000
and always that's what's always sucked

1253
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:13,720
is you go to Jamaica and there's so much

1254
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:16,400
plenty but you felt that same

1255
00:52:13,719 --> 00:52:18,679
prohibition whip yeah no matter who you

1256
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:20,200
are no matter what status I'm like yeah

1257
00:52:18,679 --> 00:52:22,838
but you're smoking in your private

1258
00:52:20,199 --> 00:52:25,960
location you're not free Freedom isn't

1259
00:52:22,838 --> 00:52:29,318
really there so true if it can lift an

1260
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:31,519
island economy back into a stage where

1261
00:52:29,318 --> 00:52:34,000
they're endemic products you cannot get

1262
00:52:31,519 --> 00:52:36,079
our sun you cannot get our soil you

1263
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:38,639
cannot produce these strains no it's

1264
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:40,559
their Niche Jamaica is Jamaica that's

1265
00:52:38,639 --> 00:52:44,719
why their coffee isn't a isn't can't be

1266
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:46,359
copied so right I'm it's it's blowing

1267
00:52:44,719 --> 00:52:48,558
their minds and that's why it's going so

1268
00:52:46,358 --> 00:52:50,639
slow but every step of the way it seems

1269
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:53,240
to be the more they weigh out each

1270
00:52:50,639 --> 00:52:54,719
factor seems the more it's going to be

1271
00:52:53,239 --> 00:52:57,039
viable seems it seems like they have a

1272
00:52:54,719 --> 00:52:59,480
lot to go over so I just you know I get

1273
00:52:57,039 --> 00:53:01,719
I see the releases in the newspaper and

1274
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:04,159
I post them on my Facebook account and

1275
00:53:01,719 --> 00:53:07,639
uh it seems like the last one covered a

1276
00:53:04,159 --> 00:53:09,239
ridiculous amount of awesome stuff so

1277
00:53:07,639 --> 00:53:10,798
we'll just uh see where it goes

1278
00:53:09,239 --> 00:53:12,679
hopefully in the next couple of months

1279
00:53:10,798 --> 00:53:15,559
we're uh down in Jamaica I'm actually

1280
00:53:12,679 --> 00:53:17,519
going to Jamaica uh next week this end

1281
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:19,480
