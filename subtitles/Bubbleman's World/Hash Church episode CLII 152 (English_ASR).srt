driving over people with cars on the RAM

66
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:09,729
blast just terrible terrible [ __ ] and I

67
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:12,789
don't know it goes to show that the

68
00:03:09,729 --> 00:03:14,259
world is in pain and maybe the next time

69
00:03:12,789 --> 00:03:17,319
you interact with someone that seems

70
00:03:14,259 --> 00:03:18,759
like there is maybe instead of flipping

71
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:21,849
out on them and getting into an argument

72
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:23,769
with them you could you could share the

73
00:03:21,849 --> 00:03:34,359
little share a little positivity with

74
00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:36,519
with them welcome Johnny B so would you

75
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:38,830
feel that negative energy walk by give

76
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:40,420
it a hey buddy good morning and bring

77
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:41,860
that energy back up for that person

78
00:03:40,419 --> 00:03:44,349
because that all that needs is that

79
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:47,590
little bit of hay and some people that

80
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:50,739
just brightens their day it's very true

81
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:53,170
morning to all you guys yes we had

82
00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:55,180
recently here in Vancouver we had I

83
00:03:53,169 --> 00:03:56,799
guess a right-wing group was gonna do

84
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:58,989
some hate speech thing that they were

85
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:01,239
applying for and so people were like

86
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:04,959
let's go down to City Hall and protest

87
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:07,930
and well Vancouver showed up in drones I

88
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,900
suspect there was four or five thousand

89
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:12,010
people that showed up for this little

90
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:15,969
protest and it's just good to see that

91
00:04:12,009 --> 00:04:17,829
some people are gonna maintain and keep

92
00:04:15,969 --> 00:04:20,918
things on track the way they need to be

93
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:22,449
because it seems like hate is really

94
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:24,279
rooting itself and I'm not sure that

95
00:04:22,449 --> 00:04:28,089
it's actually rooting itself as much as

96
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:28,839
we are seeing it more we're covering it

97
00:04:28,089 --> 00:04:31,269
more than ever

98
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:32,919
it's what the news is sharing with us so

99
00:04:31,269 --> 00:04:35,469
there's tons of love going on out there

100
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:37,660
as well I know for a fact because well

101
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:42,220
because I love my bong and here it is

102
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:47,139
with me and so Johnny loves his bong I

103
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:48,460
see him smiling I love mine too but yeah

104
00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:50,918
they're gonna try and do that next week

105
00:04:48,459 --> 00:04:53,199
in Berkeley

106
00:04:50,918 --> 00:04:54,668
they have no permit but already

107
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,500
fortunately some very intelligent

108
00:04:54,668 --> 00:04:59,589
friends of mine are doing what they did

109
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:01,839
in Germany and are sponsoring a Nazi to

110
00:04:59,589 --> 00:05:03,909
walk so for every mile the Nazi walk

111
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:06,219
they're raising money for anti hate

112
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:08,230
groups so they raise money over on

113
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:11,650
GoFundMe for Berkeley loves a freak show

114
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:14,680
an anti-nazi fundraiser a fund raiser to

115
00:05:11,649 --> 00:05:17,229
end hate so if you want to that's over

116
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:21,639
on GoFundMe and we're just trying to use

117
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:23,560
positivity to cook you know to knock

118
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:25,060
down some of this hate so you know no

119
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,918
one's going to confront them no one's

120
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:29,290
gonna get in their faces from our group

121
00:05:26,918 --> 00:05:31,449
that is because you know nothing good

122
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:33,069
was gonna hey they're raising money

123
00:05:31,449 --> 00:05:34,509
though so why would you confront them

124
00:05:33,069 --> 00:05:37,360
it's like keep going man that guy in

125
00:05:34,509 --> 00:05:40,959
Europe in Germany we think 10 euros per

126
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:43,000
mile walked and they're encouraging

127
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:45,099
people to bring bananas and other foods

128
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,589
and fruits to keep them walking and

129
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:49,270
moving so they're trying to also keep

130
00:05:47,589 --> 00:05:51,189
them healthy on top of that so they're

131
00:05:49,269 --> 00:05:53,859
missing one thing everybody's just gotta

132
00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:56,800
get a bomb no you can't really do that

133
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:57,879

134
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,740

00:05:57,879 --> 00:06:01,360
kill them with love you know meet the

136
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:04,509
hate with nothing but love because

137

138
00:06:04,509 --> 00:06:14,800

after it's empty oh no dude break it

277
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:20,590
right away you know that way we can

278
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:23,740
figure out what one of the weaknesses is

279
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:26,259
and like I'm looking for critiques not

280
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:27,970
like you know oh it's Vince and it's

281
00:13:26,259 --> 00:13:29,439
that it's so great it's just like we

282
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:32,230
want to find out what we can make better

283
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,900
right away cuz it's obviously not the

284
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:37,120
be-all end-all pen it's the first

285
00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:40,389
generation it's version one and now you

286
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:42,909
can play with it cuz yeah I'm looking

287
00:13:40,389 --> 00:13:44,379
for it myself because I've given up one

288
00:13:42,909 --> 00:13:46,959
pens altogether because it's just like

289
00:13:44,379 --> 00:13:48,549
all of you I went on a trip a couple of

290
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:53,070
years ago and I started off with eight

291
00:13:48,549 --> 00:13:53,069
pens and day one seven of them broke

292
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:59,100
really drove literally drove to

293
00:13:56,649 --> 00:14:01,689
Flagstaff on the the the first head II

294
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:03,700
smoke shop I could find and went and

295
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:06,070
bought a [ __ ] manual rig for the rest

296
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:09,580
of the trip because I was just done with

297
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:12,430
it done I just I hate when [ __ ] doesn't

298
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:14,710
work and I I love people who and I have

299
00:14:12,429 --> 00:14:18,039
friends who have made these but the pens

300
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:21,370
suck so now that bubble man which I love

301
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:23,019
this stuff as well as Omicron which was

302
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:25,360
the only pen that works for me

303
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:28,029
consistently but there's still kind of

304
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,409
messy to deal with I'm definitely

305
00:14:28,029 --> 00:14:32,549
looking forward to giving this an

306
00:14:29,409 --> 00:14:35,049
opportunity dude this one gives a damn

307
00:14:32,549 --> 00:14:36,669
and it gives it right to the end I just

308
00:14:35,049 --> 00:14:40,509
probably took my last rep because it's

309
00:14:36,669 --> 00:14:43,059
pretty much empty and it tasted as good

310
00:14:40,509 --> 00:14:45,850
as the first rib and the battery lasted

311
00:14:43,059 --> 00:14:47,619
the whole [ __ ] like how whatever

312
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:48,970
brilliant thing is that yeah I designed

313
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:53,320
the battery so it would last the whole

314
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:55,629
cartridge I'm like thank you another

315
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:57,850
thing about these pens as well as with

316
00:14:55,629 --> 00:15:00,309
my traveling the way I've done it up I

317
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:02,440
don't you know I don't like smoking and

318
00:15:00,309 --> 00:15:04,449
driving and everything it thinks the

319
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:08,260
truck up and everything else then you

320
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:10,120
get you know exposed if you get pulled

321
00:15:08,259 --> 00:15:11,620
over you're oh it smells like weed in

322
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:13,539
here then you're getting jacked up and

323
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:16,899

324
00:15:13,539 --> 00:15:19,179
removing this proving that now the Pens

325
00:15:16,899 --> 00:15:20,409
that I've taken on the trips there they

326
00:15:19,179 --> 00:15:22,329
were great that 1/8

327
00:15:20,409 --> 00:15:24,250
I really like that was a good one but

328
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:26,080
the thing is is you reload it yeah and

329
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:28,480
you keep your load reload and you leave

330
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:30,730
that a packs in the pen overnight in the

331
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,200
cab of the truck overnight and it smells

332
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:34,180
like you've been smoking a joint in

333
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:36,820
there because of the residue that's left

334
00:15:34,179 --> 00:15:38,649
on it that still stinks so even those

335
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:41,710
ones were shitty and then the disposal

336
00:15:38,649 --> 00:15:43,840
disposable throwaway ones you're they're

337
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:45,910
disposable throw aways and the stuff

338
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:48,790
that's usually in them is really

339
00:15:45,909 --> 00:15:54,639
disposable throwaway [ __ ] to beat beaver

340
00:15:48,789 --> 00:15:56,199
turps exactly beaver turps so I don't

341
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,120
know I'm looking forward to this one

342
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:01,210
really looking forward to it especially

343
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:03,070
with being able to mix your own you know

344
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:05,920
you got the turkey kit mix into with

345
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:07,360
your rosin the whole spectrum of it

346
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:08,769
right there and then you're not smoking

347
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,810
you nuts and small like roaches and

348
00:16:08,769 --> 00:16:13,929
everything else it's well it sounds like

349
00:16:10,809 --> 00:16:15,639
it maintains a hell of a long charge -

350
00:16:13,929 --> 00:16:18,399
how long have you gotten it to go there

351
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:20,799
be meant well with the lanyard on there

352
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,539
I want to that'll be perfect with the

353
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:25,389
lanyard for my fishing out in the water

354
00:16:22,539 --> 00:16:28,389
and everything flow ambulance earth over

355
00:16:25,389 --> 00:16:30,189
over 24 hours at 10:00 it was like 36 or

356
00:16:28,389 --> 00:16:33,250
37 hours that we were just hitting the

357
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:33,820
[ __ ] out of this thing so that's pretty

358
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,919
impressive

359
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:39,190
it's tasty the thing here's the thing

360
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:40,809
the pen itself I'm you know I'd love to

361
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:43,360
give it props and whatnot but it's it's

362
00:16:40,809 --> 00:16:45,669
a pen that's been made it's it's like

363
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,620
it's just a pen that looked at all the

364
00:16:45,669 --> 00:16:47,949
other pens and made it way made it

365
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,899
better

366
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:51,970
just like improved all of these

367
00:16:49,899 --> 00:16:53,350
different things that were bothering us

368
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:55,480
you know temperatures that could be

369
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:58,779
achieved this pen can hit a low temp tab

370
00:16:55,480 --> 00:17:01,269
at 300 or you could literally hit it for

371
00:16:58,779 --> 00:17:04,029
312 seconds and get it up to like like a

372
00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:06,490
Johnny me thousand degree hits like

373
00:17:04,029 --> 00:17:09,369
those big hit it will give it will give

374
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:11,170
clouds it will make you cough like

375
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:12,639
you've never coughed and the thing is is

376
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:16,990
that more importantly than the pen

377
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:19,420
itself it's the Terp oil that's like six

378
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:23,109
drops of terpenes into half a gram of

379
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:24,939
rosin to create this viscous oil this is

380
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:27,068
what you're really hitting for the first

381
00:17:24,939 --> 00:17:29,090
time when Tony first told me is like

382
00:17:27,068 --> 00:17:31,249
dude it tastes way better than your

383
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:32,720
and I was like well dude how could it

384
00:17:31,249 --> 00:17:36,558
tastes better than the rig and he's like

385
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:39,319
bro the terpenes it's got more terpenes

386
00:17:36,558 --> 00:17:41,990
than anything you're smoking on your rig

387
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:45,288
so when you hit it in the pen every hit

388
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:47,058
you you take coats your lips in the tur

389
00:17:45,288 --> 00:17:50,499
prim so even five minutes later you

390
00:17:47,058 --> 00:17:54,079
could lick your lips and be like oh yeah

391
00:17:50,499 --> 00:17:58,069
it's unreal truly blown away by it I was

392
00:17:54,079 --> 00:18:00,528
a little nervous I'm happy well don't

393
00:17:58,069 --> 00:18:01,398
don't hit it so hard Mackey khlo if you

394
00:18:00,528 --> 00:18:04,278
don't want a coffee

395
00:18:01,398 --> 00:18:06,048
don't hit the three buttons in a row you

396
00:18:04,278 --> 00:18:07,970
know one twelve second another twelve

397
00:18:06,048 --> 00:18:10,368
second another twelve second that's the

398
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:13,579
three the three presses that is the JB

399
00:18:10,368 --> 00:18:18,579
that's the Johnny be like 1200 degree

400
00:18:13,579 --> 00:18:20,808
rip rip now you know what after this

401
00:18:18,579 --> 00:18:22,609
torches man they're just such a headache

402
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:27,259
I got like four year finally got one to

403
00:18:22,609 --> 00:18:29,028
work nice go with the Blazers Blazers

404
00:18:27,259 --> 00:18:31,490
make the best torches I was gonna say

405
00:18:29,028 --> 00:18:34,308
yeah and they just work yeah I've played

406
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:36,798
around with all the little stuff but who

407
00:18:34,308 --> 00:18:39,168
goes back to way back in the 90s I

408
00:18:36,798 --> 00:18:41,388
bought a blazer torch at Arnold

409
00:18:39,169 --> 00:18:43,730
Schwarzenegger cigar place down in Los

410
00:18:41,388 --> 00:18:46,788
Angeles and I still have that lighter

411
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:50,179
and it still works so it's Japanese

412
00:18:46,788 --> 00:18:54,138
company B la zer and they make the

413
00:18:50,179 --> 00:18:56,600
finest most consistent working just keep

414
00:18:54,138 --> 00:18:59,269
a good fuel in it and they'll go last

415
00:18:56,599 --> 00:19:01,248
year that's the whole thing we all have

416
00:18:59,269 --> 00:19:05,118
torch problems I know we've all thrown

417
00:19:01,249 --> 00:19:07,009
them out the door out the window or if

418
00:19:05,118 --> 00:19:09,288
you had them like light up on you or it

419
00:19:07,009 --> 00:19:15,440
almost exploded on you or the gas shoot

420
00:19:09,288 --> 00:19:17,658
at the bottom of it right yeah I just

421
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,999
had that live you saw the bigfooting

422
00:19:17,659 --> 00:19:22,309
so yeah I'm such a big big flame etc you

423
00:19:19,999 --> 00:19:24,409
know that's the problem that's probably

424
00:19:22,308 --> 00:19:26,480
the torch tubes you know I have a couple

425
00:19:24,409 --> 00:19:27,950
of torch tubes and they're great and one

426
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,808
time Todd and I were on our way to the

427
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:31,548
airport I had the torch chip in the back

428
00:19:29,808 --> 00:19:34,398
of this limo on the way and we hit a

429
00:19:31,548 --> 00:19:38,808
bump and the bump caused just enough of

430
00:19:34,398 --> 00:19:40,339
a cause in the airflow that it still was

431
00:19:38,808 --> 00:19:42,680
shooting out

432
00:19:40,339 --> 00:19:45,169
the gas was shooting out now the flame

433
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:47,180
was completely ensconced and around

434
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:51,710
because the vapor spread out and went

435
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:54,620
basically around it I was like holy [ __ ]

436
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:56,930
I blew it out turn it off blew it out

437
00:19:54,619 --> 00:20:00,049
and it finally went out and it was just

438
00:19:56,930 --> 00:20:02,060
um Jesus one of those moments for you

439
00:20:00,049 --> 00:20:03,559
like uh I was glad I was in artillery to

440
00:20:02,059 --> 00:20:06,559
know my safety training and how to

441
00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:08,690
handle intense situations because that

442
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:10,369
could have ended up really bad so it

443
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:12,320
showed me again that you know even

444
00:20:10,369 --> 00:20:17,659
though again torch tubes are great

445
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:20,089
inside of a you know on a safe surface

446
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:22,940
not in a car bouncing so what I mean by

447
00:20:20,089 --> 00:20:27,829
torch to people is they actually have a

448
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:29,779
a gas chamber on an actual pipe and

449
00:20:27,829 --> 00:20:31,669
there's an actual gas release where you

450
00:20:29,779 --> 00:20:34,639
can actually fill it and release it and

451
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:38,570
it's all in one piece so it's actually a

452
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:39,530
torch tube and a pipe all in one so

453
00:20:38,569 --> 00:20:42,789
that's what I was talking about not

454
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:45,769
talking about separately an actual torch

455
00:20:42,789 --> 00:20:47,720
altogether but as you saw it does happen

456
00:20:45,769 --> 00:20:49,789
with like Johnny be right there you just

457
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:51,490
saw you know a three-foot flame that

458
00:20:49,789 --> 00:20:54,500
shoots off there which can be

459
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:56,210
uncomfortable and disconcerting to

460
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,740
people around you as you know it's not

461
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:59,390
heating up the nail either that's the

462
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:01,069
main concern right now well you know

463
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:02,960
what someone gave me a torch when I was

464
00:21:01,069 --> 00:21:06,079
last in Toronto it was I think it was

465
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:08,000
710 Kingston the the shop and I'll

466
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:09,859
definitely shout out the right ones if

467
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,559
it wasn't Steve comes to mind it was a

468
00:21:09,859 --> 00:21:14,509
green blazer and when my friend Neil

469
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:16,970
gave it to me through this guy he said

470
00:21:14,509 --> 00:21:19,549
you know make sure it was actually John

471
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:22,009
when his business partner who said

472
00:21:19,549 --> 00:21:23,599
listen when you fill up the torch you

473
00:21:22,009 --> 00:21:26,539
really have to let it settle for a while

474
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:28,250
and let it let the butane you know it's

475
00:21:26,539 --> 00:21:30,349
basically like something about and I

476
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:32,210
think I mentioned it one time but I got

477
00:21:30,349 --> 00:21:34,129
it wrong and someone came on my youtube

478
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:36,500
and explained it really beautifully I

479
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:39,260
can't remember which which episode or

480
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:44,569
what what comment it was but it's

481
00:21:39,259 --> 00:21:48,619
basically like not filling the torch and

482
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:50,389
then using a little o-ring on the inside

483
00:21:48,619 --> 00:21:52,309
of the torch and I guess it can do what

484
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:53,059
Johnny's is doing and it can also leak

485
00:21:52,309 --> 00:21:54,950
like

486
00:21:53,058 --> 00:21:57,619
assistant li leak so you're just using

487
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:59,509
gas for no good reason so when you put

488
00:21:57,619 --> 00:22:01,518
your your gas and those torches

489
00:21:59,509 --> 00:22:04,519
definitely leave them for a bit don't be

490
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:05,778
hitting that [ __ ] right away and make

491
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:07,669
sure when you're traveling make sure

492
00:22:05,778 --> 00:22:09,288
it's screwed off or empty is the best

493
00:22:07,669 --> 00:22:12,559
case I saw a picture the other day of

494
00:22:09,288 --> 00:22:15,138
somebody who had a gas leak inside a

495
00:22:12,558 --> 00:22:19,369
vehicle and somebody lit a cigarette and

496
00:22:15,138 --> 00:22:20,928
the car was unrecognizable so you don't

497
00:22:19,369 --> 00:22:23,239
be aware of those they do leak and

498
00:22:20,929 --> 00:22:25,570
things like Blazers actually have a red

499
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:27,888
cat that you can actually put over the

500
00:22:25,569 --> 00:22:30,048
opening valve so that that can't happen

501
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:34,729
while you travel so be aware it and be

502
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:36,589
safe it is explosive gas and it will

503
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:39,230
harm you it will burn you and those

504
00:22:36,589 --> 00:22:41,959
torches are 2200 degrees they will scar

505
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:44,149
you yeah for life

506
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:46,429
I can like it's about to say I think

507
00:22:44,148 --> 00:22:48,548
everybody's got a baron somewhere you

508
00:22:46,429 --> 00:22:52,580
know a couple of little circular

509
00:22:48,548 --> 00:22:55,339
half-moons here they're always the most

510
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:58,849
sensitive part of your body like inside

511
00:22:55,339 --> 00:23:01,220
your arm it's like reaching across the

512
00:22:58,849 --> 00:23:02,990
dirty table here's one right here yeah I

513
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:05,868
was just reaching across the table and I

514
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:09,558
on the inside there we need to get the

515
00:23:05,868 --> 00:23:11,388
dim Sun table with the wired email

516
00:23:09,558 --> 00:23:13,249
wallah that goes down through the center

517
00:23:11,388 --> 00:23:15,229
and you can just roll that thing around

518
00:23:13,249 --> 00:23:19,129
here you go get it out of my way I need

519
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:23,808
to reach battle scars puff scars that's

520
00:23:19,128 --> 00:23:28,009
what that is puffs scars my last burn is

521
00:23:23,808 --> 00:23:32,298
from an electric nail so it's not gas

522
00:23:28,009 --> 00:23:36,499
related at all it's just stupid related

523
00:23:32,298 --> 00:23:38,109
Oh dad I've done that too I'm still

524
00:23:36,499 --> 00:23:40,819
human last time I checked

525
00:23:38,109 --> 00:23:43,908
man remember hot knives those things

526
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:45,499
used to scar the [ __ ] out of people oh

527
00:23:43,909 --> 00:23:47,570
come on I went to school with the

528
00:23:45,499 --> 00:23:48,618
perfect knife mark on my chin at least

529
00:23:47,569 --> 00:23:52,519
five times

530
00:23:48,618 --> 00:23:55,548
oh and you notice how the tips of your

531
00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:57,710
knives always stay that tempered color

532
00:23:55,548 --> 00:24:01,099
here never change bag no matter how hard

533
00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:02,440
you try to polish it Jesus I never burnt

534
00:24:01,099 --> 00:24:04,599
my lip but I had

535
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:09,460
that did it and I had one friend that

536
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:11,888
passed out unconscious on the stove had

537
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:15,759
like the bullseye on his chest that was

538
00:24:11,888 --> 00:24:17,349
an ER visit that one the lip that's just

539
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:20,440
bad but passing out on the stove

540
00:24:17,349 --> 00:24:22,359
unconscious and burning while you're

541
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:25,240
stoned friends talk around the kitchen

542
00:24:22,359 --> 00:24:28,298
table with their backs to you that's

543
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:30,038
yeah don't recommend that don't

544
00:24:28,298 --> 00:24:32,168
recommend that that's probably the worst

545
00:24:30,038 --> 00:24:34,778
sort of hot knife injury that you can

546
00:24:32,169 --> 00:24:36,129
get really the unconscious I mean maybe

547
00:24:34,778 --> 00:24:37,869
it could be worse if you had a glass

548
00:24:36,128 --> 00:24:40,509
there and you cut yourself while you

549
00:24:37,869 --> 00:24:44,619
fell so you were born maybe if you were

550
00:24:40,509 --> 00:24:47,048
making BHO and breathing nitrous oxide

551
00:24:44,619 --> 00:24:49,989
and doing that all at the same time

552
00:24:47,048 --> 00:24:51,490
there you go that's stepping it up let

553
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:57,220
me guess you've patented that already

554

575
00:25:52,778 --> 00:25:56,470
and folding the corners roughly and

576
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:58,929

585
00:26:18,259 --> 00:26:21,319
a good little squishy I liked how you

586
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:23,090
just those little because I use the bags

587
00:26:21,319 --> 00:26:25,849
I was frustrated with him right

588
00:26:23,089 --> 00:26:29,179
my dad will have the Sasquatch um this

589
00:26:25,849 --> 00:26:31,369
the new little thing that I like because

590
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:34,009
I like that the two gram little press

591
00:26:31,369 --> 00:26:38,329
this with myself every day a good little

592
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:40,480
squisher 30% it was nice like 10 percent

593
00:26:38,329 --> 00:26:44,089
more than what people are getting

594
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:47,360
generally in their highest ratios it's

595
00:26:44,089 --> 00:26:49,250
[ __ ] insane dude so what John was

596
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:51,289
talking about in that little video if

597
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:54,230
you haven't seen it was making sure the

598
00:26:51,289 --> 00:26:55,609
corners are full here let me just mute

599
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:57,079
you for a second John because it'll

600
00:26:55,609 --> 00:26:57,669
change the camera when I'm trying to

601
00:26:57,079 --> 00:27:01,970
show it

602
00:26:57,670 --> 00:27:04,160
yeah the corners are squared so he makes

603
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:05,539
sure that herb packs into those corners

604
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:08,000
and sometimes when you're using really

605
00:27:05,539 --> 00:27:10,279
nice dense nugget you really have to

606
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,900
work the bud into those corners you have

607
00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:13,609
to break it up real small and get the

608
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:17,000
corners filled up it's important because

609
00:27:13,609 --> 00:27:18,859
what happens is is the oil fills up

610
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,589
those little empty spaces anywhere

611
00:27:18,859 --> 00:27:24,169
there's empty spaces oil will sit on the

612
00:27:21,589 --> 00:27:26,869
screen and hang out you can press it off

613
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:29,509
and get it out it's it's it's not ideal

614
00:27:26,869 --> 00:27:32,059
you know especially when you if you saw

615
00:27:29,509 --> 00:27:35,150
that first press if you didn't see that

616
00:27:32,059 --> 00:27:36,980
first press oh my god I feel like I

617
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:39,680
should play it for you right now

618
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:44,420
like it's that it's worthy of a hash

619
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:46,100
Church I looked at that in the first

620
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:47,660
thing I did is I ran outside and grab

621
00:27:46,099 --> 00:27:48,939
the little corners and I was like okay

622
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:51,500
there you go

623
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:53,269
well that's what we're learning you know

624
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:55,400
this is about the technology it's still

625
00:27:53,269 --> 00:27:57,950
new so any information that we can

626
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:59,750
spread or make people aware of you know

627
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:01,789
everybody wants their gut right

628
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:03,619
everybody wants their oil so nobody

629
00:28:01,789 --> 00:28:06,829
wants to lose it inside there squish

630
00:28:03,619 --> 00:28:09,679
bags so any techniques or ways that they

631
00:28:06,829 --> 00:28:12,049
can learn is only it makes a betterment

632
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:14,000
for all because you know hey even when I

633
00:28:12,049 --> 00:28:16,159
went to Alaska a couple of weeks ago

634
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,470
what was the guy doing he made me fresh

635
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:20,540
rosin while I was there in Alaska and I

636
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:22,190
couldn't have been happier which means

637
00:28:20,539 --> 00:28:24,170
you know before listening people are

638
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:25,490
paying attention and they want to know

639
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:27,679
they want to learn

640
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:29,029
you know what is the temperature you're

641
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:31,250
both played what is the temperature of

642
00:28:29,029 --> 00:28:33,279
the below plate those things are key

643
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:36,890
situations for people to know because

644
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:38,690
they also you know as much information

645
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:39,920
they can get on quality products so that

646
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:41,058
they can run through and get a

647
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:43,700
consistent product

648
00:28:41,058 --> 00:28:45,889
I tell everybody months I mean watching

649
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:48,019
the video here that marks playing and

650
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:49,580
you can just see how it will starts

651
00:28:48,019 --> 00:28:51,410
pushing out the sides and I was like how

652
00:28:49,579 --> 00:28:53,629
do we go back it grounds with

653
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:55,100
percentages and just even talking over

654
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:57,410
the temperatures but that key thing was

655
00:28:55,099 --> 00:28:59,359
putting that squishing that butter

656
00:28:57,410 --> 00:29:01,730
laughter and you notice you notice I'm

657
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:03,709
using the hand pump like how like three

658
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:05,779
pumps got the bag it's closed and

659
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:08,090
suddenly like this right here would have

660
00:29:05,779 --> 00:29:11,629
been a great press if it just stopped

661
00:29:08,089 --> 00:29:14,149
right here what is what temperatures

662
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:16,370
were using there and on your place he

663
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:18,309
was kicking around 200 degrees maybe

664
00:29:16,369 --> 00:29:20,928
hotter and we'll see when we pull back

665
00:29:18,308 --> 00:29:22,759
could have been between two he had them

666
00:29:20,929 --> 00:29:24,050
hotter than I thought and people like oh

667
00:29:22,759 --> 00:29:25,730
you can get rid of those bubbles I'm

668
00:29:24,049 --> 00:29:27,529
like yeah I know I understand Matt was

669
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:29,179
doing all the pressing he owns the

670
00:29:27,529 --> 00:29:31,609
company he built the press I'm gonna

671
00:29:29,179 --> 00:29:35,480
watch him do it I love the flow on that

672
00:29:31,609 --> 00:29:36,919
right far right piece there it's just

673
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:41,299
like look at that thing

674
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:43,308
bending down the neck Bobby dude and it

675
00:29:41,299 --> 00:29:47,419
tasted so good here was a unique thing

676
00:29:43,308 --> 00:29:50,480
about the the where is my bike very very

677
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:54,140
chirpy Nalini very you know almost a

678
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:56,360
narrow leaf drug cultivar esque and it

679
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:59,179
just had such a beautiful taste and

680
00:29:56,359 --> 00:30:02,000
terpene profile I put in six drops of

681
00:29:59,179 --> 00:30:07,040
Clementine terpenes with a half a gram

682
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:11,630
of this rosin and the rosin absolutely

683
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:14,359
completely 100% absorbed and changed the

684
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:16,550
terpene profile of the Clementine to the

685
00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:19,250
where is my bike profile it was just a

686
00:30:16,549 --> 00:30:22,759
hundred percent where is my bike because

687
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:25,700
we put this particular resin rosin into

688
00:30:22,759 --> 00:30:29,329
the bubbleman cartridge that we hit on

689
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:30,380
it that Ken lasted us almost two days it

690
00:30:29,329 --> 00:30:31,849
was unbelievable

691
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:34,070
super tasty one of the things I also

692
00:30:31,849 --> 00:30:35,719
wanted to say when Tim was talking about

693
00:30:34,069 --> 00:30:38,000
the importance of the variables and the

694
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,899
temperatures when people ask hey what

695
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,878
temperature did

696
00:30:38,898 --> 00:30:43,158
did you hit you have to understand that

697
00:30:40,878 --> 00:30:44,868
that's not necessarily going to be the

698
00:30:43,159 --> 00:30:47,389
temperature that works for you because

699
00:30:44,868 --> 00:30:50,509
the moisture content of your bud the

700
00:30:47,388 --> 00:30:52,848
resin content the density of the bud all

701
00:30:50,509 --> 00:30:55,038
of these little variables change and

702
00:30:52,848 --> 00:30:57,798
make these sweet spots on a sliding

703
00:30:55,038 --> 00:30:59,329
scale so what I suggest to people with

704
00:30:57,798 --> 00:31:01,668
bubble hash with everything whether you

705
00:30:59,329 --> 00:31:03,128
want to learn how to properly c4 with

706
00:31:01,669 --> 00:31:06,379
whether you want to learn how to

707
00:31:03,128 --> 00:31:08,748
properly make rosin from bud or hash

708
00:31:06,378 --> 00:31:11,658
there's a sweet spot you can go too far

709
00:31:08,749 --> 00:31:13,700
and you can go not far enough and in the

710
00:31:11,659 --> 00:31:15,769
middle for most of us is where you're

711
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:18,169
gonna find that sweet spot so for rosin

712
00:31:15,769 --> 00:31:20,298
it's really simple if you have a hundred

713
00:31:18,169 --> 00:31:22,969
grams of bud or ten grams a bud take

714
00:31:20,298 --> 00:31:25,098
like half a gram or a gram and press it

715
00:31:22,969 --> 00:31:26,538
at a hotter temperature and see what

716
00:31:25,098 --> 00:31:28,368
your yield is because the hotter

717
00:31:26,538 --> 00:31:29,838
temperature will get out the majority of

718
00:31:28,368 --> 00:31:32,509
the resin you'll be like okay and now I

719
00:31:29,838 --> 00:31:34,638
know basically what the yield is maybe I

720
00:31:32,509 --> 00:31:36,950
went a little I personally I've never

721
00:31:34,638 --> 00:31:38,508
tasted my rosin go too hot yet I haven't

722
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:40,729
heated up rosin where it tastes like

723
00:31:38,509 --> 00:31:43,038
burnt popcorn I have smoked other

724
00:31:40,729 --> 00:31:47,088
people's rosin that tasted like that but

725
00:31:43,038 --> 00:31:51,079
I myself at 200 and 210 degrees have not

726
00:31:47,088 --> 00:31:53,118
gone over the point where it's it's it's

727
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:55,249
I feel like it's ruined but it's easy

728
00:31:53,118 --> 00:31:56,959
enough to go low it's easy enough to go

729
00:31:55,249 --> 00:32:02,838
high meet yourself somewhere in the

730
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:04,489
middle you're measuring the temperature

731
00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:08,118
from a built-in digital temperature

732
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:10,548
gauge or is that the is a temperature

733
00:32:08,118 --> 00:32:13,098
gauge on these machines the the

734
00:32:10,548 --> 00:32:17,719
temperature that is trying to make it or

735
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:19,939
is it the temp ends on the PID the Omega

736
00:32:17,719 --> 00:32:22,009
P IDs that I have are extremely

737
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:25,700
extremely accurate like within point 1

738
00:32:22,009 --> 00:32:28,308
most other pids are accurate within 3 to

739
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:31,159
5 degrees the other thing I was gonna

740
00:32:28,308 --> 00:32:33,950
say is that also too I can member in the

741
00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:38,089
old days when if we pressed a piece of

742
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:43,338
hash and pressed it hard enough it got

743
00:32:38,088 --> 00:32:46,069
hot yeah so just just the act of

744
00:32:43,338 --> 00:32:48,168
pressing increases temperatures what I'm

745
00:32:46,069 --> 00:32:49,759
saying yes but what I'm saying is the

746
00:32:48,169 --> 00:32:52,210
temperature doesn't matter they're just

747
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:54,160
numbers on a box what matters is

748
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:56,110
or bioassay and whether you like those

749
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:58,779
numbers high or whether you like those

750
00:32:56,109 --> 00:33:01,479
numbers low what the temperatures really

751
00:32:58,779 --> 00:33:03,339
are to me really doesn't matter because

752
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:05,589
it's my bioassay that matters I know

753
00:33:03,339 --> 00:33:07,539
that if I lower the numbers I can butter

754
00:33:05,589 --> 00:33:10,029
out the hash it usually stays a little

755
00:33:07,539 --> 00:33:12,129
more tasty and when I heat it up a

756
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:14,349
little hotter you get the full yield but

757
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:16,240
you might lose some terpene content with

758
00:33:14,349 --> 00:33:20,799
lower temperatures do you need a

759
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:22,779
stronger it's a longer squish and a

760
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:24,399
stronger squish sure like ideally you

761
00:33:22,779 --> 00:33:28,720
have that 20 ton plate

762
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:31,720
some people can compress it on less but

763
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:35,079
yeah I was wrong press that's why I love

764
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:37,809
sasquatch like even with with with like

765
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:39,939
pressing like just dry sift or hash or

766
00:33:37,809 --> 00:33:42,159
flour like I found that when I'm

767
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:43,690
pressing my sister my hash I'm doing a

768
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:45,130
lower temperature definitely I'm not

769
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:46,779
pressing as long as when I'm pressing

770
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:49,630
the flour because I'm trying to steam it

771
00:33:46,779 --> 00:33:51,309
at that point so I mean that's me

772
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:53,470
personally so it gives all different

773
00:33:51,309 --> 00:33:57,579
temperatures like mark saying depending

774
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:59,289
on what you're trying to achieve your

775
00:33:57,579 --> 00:34:01,089
sweet spot that's it it's all about

776
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:02,349
finding your sweet spot and and you know

777
00:34:01,089 --> 00:34:03,669
what everyone's so different and

778
00:34:02,349 --> 00:34:06,099
everyone has different materials so

779
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:08,680
here's here's a perfect example I'll

780
00:34:06,099 --> 00:34:11,170
squish out at like 200 degrees like that

781
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:13,089
car that where is my bike obviously the

782
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:15,340
terpene profile is off the charts

783
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:17,980
because it absorbed the Clementine

784
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:20,680
profile afterwards and all we could

785
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:22,210
taste was where is my bike yet I have

786
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:24,009
people texting me telling me oh you're

787
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:26,320
burning off half your terpene profile

788
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:29,560
maybe even more above above a blonde I'm

789
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:31,630
thinking these guys are not using bud of

790
00:34:29,559 --> 00:34:33,099
this quality with this level of terpene

791
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:36,610
they're probably using buds that are

792
00:34:33,099 --> 00:34:38,860
like 1% or less terpenes and because for

793
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:41,140
them at 200 degrees truly they don't

794
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:42,910
have many turquoise left at the end of a

795
00:34:41,139 --> 00:34:44,799
press but when you're using something

796
00:34:42,909 --> 00:34:48,159
that's more like three to four percent

797
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:51,490
terpenes they hold their own all the way

798
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:53,769
through without a shadow of a doubt so

799
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:55,239
everyone's using different quality and

800
00:34:53,769 --> 00:34:56,829
different you know there's different

801
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:58,569
levels to this [ __ ] so having

802
00:34:56,829 --> 00:35:00,699
conversations on the internet about it

803
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:02,920
is very difficult it's too bad we didn't

804
00:35:00,699 --> 00:35:04,329
have a testing device that hooked up to

805
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:05,550
all our computers and you could just put

806
00:35:04,329 --> 00:35:06,840
your little button

807
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:08,730
then it tested it and then it was like

808
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:11,250
okay you're in this room for this

809
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:14,719
conversation with this with these people

810
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:17,610
that have the same you know level of

811
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:20,339
resin terpenes profile whatever you want

812
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:21,990
to call it and as you said you know

813
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:23,370
humidity and other things are key

814
00:35:21,989 --> 00:35:25,309
factors depending on what you're

815
00:35:23,369 --> 00:35:27,809
squishing and when you're squishing so

816
00:35:25,309 --> 00:35:30,029
those are all key components and it's

817
00:35:27,809 --> 00:35:31,949
all about you know how long did it take

818
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:35,100
you to finally find your sweet spot so

819
00:35:31,949 --> 00:35:36,899
it takes some time as well to play with

820
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:38,400
it it's not something I know people who

821
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:40,769
get I've seen people get frustrated

822
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:43,710
because they tried it once or twice you

823
00:35:40,769 --> 00:35:46,050
can come out and they they give up and

824
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:48,599
that's the persistence is one of the

825
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:51,000
keys you know and there's also some

826
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:52,949
varietals will not squish we found that

827
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,829
out as well or it won't squish very well

828
00:35:52,949 --> 00:35:58,489
at all you know unfortunately that's

829
00:35:55,829 --> 00:36:09,239
just the reality of the situation

830
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:13,069
it's 100% the truth and I want to see

831
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:16,589
vaporizer where the temperature starts

832
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:19,650
low for taste and then within a few

833
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:22,110
seconds goes up to a high temperature

834
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:25,340
yes that's what my pen does that's

835
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:28,110
exactly what the pen is right now right

836
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:32,430
this second it starts out at like 300

837
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:33,809
goes up to 800 goes up to 1200 you keep

838
00:36:32,429 --> 00:36:35,869
holding that button it's just gonna get

839
00:36:33,809 --> 00:36:39,929
hotter and hotter and hotter and honor

840
00:36:35,869 --> 00:36:42,750
it's awesome no I think that's a great

841
00:36:39,929 --> 00:36:47,099
idea because first you get the taste and

842
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:49,469
then you get all the punch we got it

843
00:36:47,099 --> 00:36:51,389
from you bro it was your idea you've

844
00:36:49,469 --> 00:36:54,750
been talking about it we put it in the

845
00:36:51,389 --> 00:36:58,480
pen that patented I'll be coming to

846
00:36:54,750 --> 00:37:00,829
talking to you really soon I'll [ __ ] you

847
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:04,500
[Laughter]

848
00:37:00,829 --> 00:37:06,779
[ __ ] I'm really happy to hear somebody's

849
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:08,820
done that I wanted to finish off what Ed

850
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:10,560
tan was saying which was a very very

851
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:12,120
important part one of the most important

852
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:14,250
knowledge drops of this hash Church in

853
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:15,960
fact if you can listen don't be afraid

854
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:18,849
to make the mistake to find the sweet

855
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:21,670
spot that's the value everyone's afraid

856
00:37:18,849 --> 00:37:25,150
to make the mistake the mistakes are

857
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:28,030
what you pay for the knowledge it's not

858
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:30,070
a costly mistake it's a [ __ ] valuable

859
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:32,080
lesson you have to and you're not

860
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:33,910
necessarily ruining anything but it's

861
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:36,639
okay to find your envelope where you

862
00:37:33,909 --> 00:37:39,670
don't go far enough and you go too far

863
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:41,619
and then pull it back and pull it back

864
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:44,170
and in trying all of those different

865
00:37:41,619 --> 00:37:46,719
resins you may be surprised which one

866
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:48,930
you like you really may be surprised

867
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:54,000
sure it's cool for every Phil had Sam I

868
00:37:48,929 --> 00:37:57,099
guarantee you're right that mistakes

869
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:59,530
makes you realize that when you know how

870
00:37:57,099 --> 00:38:04,119
to do things the right way you remember

871
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:06,490
them because yeah when you screw things

872
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:10,269
up over and over and over and over and

873
00:38:06,489 --> 00:38:13,000
you finally do it right you remember how

874
00:38:10,269 --> 00:38:14,679
to do it right [ __ ] right so you know

875
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,780
it's the truth now when I show how to

876
00:38:14,679 --> 00:38:18,609
people how to make bubble they they'll

877
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:20,080
have me come in and do consulting and

878
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:21,490
make some water hash and I'll be like

879
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:24,000
all right well just so you understand

880
00:38:21,489 --> 00:38:26,979
we're gonna start off with some mistakes

881
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,690
what I paid you here to come here and

882
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:30,940
make no mistakes I'm like listen dude

883
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:32,829
you will not get your money's worth if I

884
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:34,329
don't make mistakes with you so I'm

885
00:38:32,829 --> 00:38:36,279
gonna show you some key mistakes that

886
00:38:34,329 --> 00:38:39,130
people make they won't be too bad we'll

887
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:40,900
still save the resin and it'll be very

888
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:42,910
very important for you to learn with

889
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:45,820
other materials to find your sweet spot

890
00:38:42,909 --> 00:38:47,739
rather than assume it's a [ __ ] recipe

891
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:51,039
that stays the same all the time

892
00:38:47,739 --> 00:38:52,809
it changes that's the nuance that's the

893
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:55,389
value when you can understand the

894
00:38:52,809 --> 00:39:00,699
changes and if you can't understand the

895
00:38:55,389 --> 00:39:03,639
changes make some [ __ ] mistakes and

896
00:39:00,699 --> 00:39:05,679
it's okay it's it's fine all of us here

897
00:39:03,639 --> 00:39:08,079
did not get where we are by getting it

898
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:09,549
right the first time oh my god people

899
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:11,259
like how'd you get so good at this I'm

900
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:13,600
like I made way more [ __ ] mistakes

901
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:16,060
than you that's how do you want to be

902
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:17,650
better than me you got about a hundred

903
00:39:16,059 --> 00:39:20,469
and fifty thousand mistakes you better

904
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:21,970
get on makin and you will surpass me no

905
00:39:20,469 --> 00:39:24,419
problem it's gonna happen there's a lot

906
00:39:21,969 --> 00:39:27,069
of younger I'm in along with people

907
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:29,110
there's etiquette mistakes as we speak

908
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:31,360
you know in their 20s they're like yeah

909
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:32,090
I'm inspired I'm gonna make some serious

910
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:35,059
[ __ ]

911
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:37,250
stays so my biggest mistakes were my

912
00:39:35,059 --> 00:39:39,949
greatest mistakes like I would not ever

913
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:41,840
change getting busted at the roadblock

914
00:39:39,949 --> 00:39:46,099
was 16 pounds in 6 grand cash

915
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:48,019
that [ __ ] was extremely like a huge

916
00:39:46,099 --> 00:39:50,420
bummer but it was a very valuable lesson

917
00:39:48,019 --> 00:39:52,519
that that led me in a direction that

918
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:54,970
really brought me here today where we

919
00:39:52,519 --> 00:39:57,739

00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:14,710
neck of the woods I think it's happening

986
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:16,720
everywhere in the world I was gonna say

987
00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:19,720
that it is happening on like that no

988
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:21,639
question no the world's flat dude it's a

989
00:43:19,719 --> 00:43:25,750
disc we only live on one side and it's

990
00:43:21,639 --> 00:43:27,789
upright like this I figured it all out I

991
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:29,980
figured I figured it all out with math

992
00:43:27,789 --> 00:43:34,210
I'll show you later Johnny B you can do

993
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:37,030
a video on it it'll be young it's now

994
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:40,720
flood earth Church now with more Beaver

995
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:45,250
chirps now with more beaver Terps I like

996
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:50,230
that my goodness

997
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:51,820
I picked up that soil balance that came

998
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:55,179
to nail for me last week this week I

999
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:57,750
should say so of course with my few

1000
00:43:55,179 --> 00:43:59,489
plants litter outside and have

1001
00:43:57,750 --> 00:44:01,980
we looked after that well just kind of

1002
00:43:59,489 --> 00:44:03,629
getting them ready got treated them and

1003
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:05,449
see how it goes and take a look at the

1004
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:08,670
product didn't kind of interested to see

1005
00:44:05,449 --> 00:44:10,109
you know the difference in what they're

1006
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:13,380
claiming so I'm kind of cool when the

1007
00:44:10,110 --> 00:44:17,849
next three or four months if it does

1008
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:19,410
affect the same strain where I was yeah

1009
00:44:17,849 --> 00:44:20,880
I'm looking forward to it as well

1010
00:44:19,409 --> 00:44:23,069
what strain you're gonna be playing with

1011
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:25,200
Danny medica

1012
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:27,780
that's the one that works that's my

1013
00:44:25,199 --> 00:44:28,859
that's my medicine that's I was having

1014
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:31,950
problems eating like the other day I

1015
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:34,320
mean he's really bad and just you need

1016
00:44:31,949 --> 00:44:35,759
something that works so well last night

1017
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:38,190
got some chocolates that were made

1018
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:40,380
there's some same pain terpene profiles

1019
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:42,000
taking THC levels and wow it's just

1020
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:44,519
amazing how well it works it looks uh

1021
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,690
it's really key thing that affects me

1022
00:44:44,519 --> 00:44:48,449
that's what I need and I know what

1023
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:51,869
strange like use for that wherever I go

1024
00:44:48,449 --> 00:44:54,779
now so because okay this so speaking as

1025
00:44:51,869 --> 00:44:57,630
we were earlier of trial and error being

1026
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:59,820
a patient a patient that you are I want

1027
00:44:57,630 --> 00:45:02,730
you to give some [ __ ] up reality here

1028
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:06,080
how long did it take you to find that

1029
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:08,309
particular genetic that works for you

1030
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:09,989
well you know what I mean I've been

1031
00:45:08,309 --> 00:45:12,179
using cannabis as medicine for basically

1032
00:45:09,989 --> 00:45:16,739
my whole life in a way but I mean at ton

1033
00:45:12,179 --> 00:45:18,210
venture in 2005 when I fell I then came

1034
00:45:16,739 --> 00:45:19,949
across a strain about a year and a half

1035
00:45:18,210 --> 00:45:22,860
two years later and I really realized

1036
00:45:19,949 --> 00:45:24,869
how it helped me and over the years I

1037
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:27,329
tried some other strange different ways

1038
00:45:24,869 --> 00:45:29,489
how to decarboxylate with edibles throw

1039
00:45:27,329 --> 00:45:31,409
stuff between those there's all kinds of

1040
00:45:29,489 --> 00:45:34,199
different ways but I mean in reality

1041
00:45:31,409 --> 00:45:36,299
honestly it's taken it's taken this long

1042
00:45:34,199 --> 00:45:38,250
it's taken eleven twelve years of me

1043
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:40,980
dealing with my anger jokers everyday

1044
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:43,079
I'm realizing what benefits me more and

1045
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:45,420
how I can use CBD in the morning and use

1046
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:47,219
this strain at night so it's always a

1047
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:49,440
learning lesson for me that Jenna that's

1048
00:45:47,219 --> 00:45:52,230
pretty much saying that now I know the

1049
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,700
profile that helps so good with my pain

1050
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:55,679
I'm starting to see that you know

1051
00:45:53,699 --> 00:45:58,019
anything over 400 milligrams of CBD

1052
00:45:55,679 --> 00:46:00,659
really helps me with my knees and and

1053
00:45:58,019 --> 00:46:02,489
that has to deal with neuropathy and the

1054
00:46:00,659 --> 00:46:03,149
spinal cord injury so I see what works

1055
00:46:02,489 --> 00:46:07,259
for me now

1056
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:09,840
and help you say you know the profile is

1057
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:12,660
that the cannabinoid to enter P profile

1058
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:14,760
or just to cannabinoid while learning

1059
00:46:12,659 --> 00:46:16,259
with the terpene profile with myself

1060
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:17,880
because I know the peppy or the murse

1061
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:19,800
you know those type of strains work for

1062
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:21,539
me and also like more of like anywhere

1063
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:23,700
for three to five percent see me from

1064
00:46:21,539 --> 00:46:26,250
anywhere from to say 25 to 29 percent

1065
00:46:23,699 --> 00:46:28,469
THC I see those ratios that work for me

1066
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:30,780
quite consistently like Mark says I like

1067
00:46:28,469 --> 00:46:33,000
to hit things hot things in that

1068
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:35,040
direction I know what works for me and

1069
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,630
that's what I was it's like I said I'm

1070
00:46:35,039 --> 00:46:38,159
still learning every day and that's one

1071
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:40,170
thing I learn about dealing with my fan

1072
00:46:38,159 --> 00:46:42,089
it's something that you have to work on

1073
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:43,829
all the time I went off my amino acids

1074
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:46,350
for a while I'm back on them I realized

1075
00:46:43,829 --> 00:46:48,420
how much they pay a key role dealing

1076
00:46:46,349 --> 00:46:50,579
when I'm eating cannabis to help with

1077
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:52,680
the safe passing blood Granberry with

1078
00:46:50,579 --> 00:46:54,900
natural GABA and tyrosine and all the

1079
00:46:52,679 --> 00:46:58,980
stuff that I take I'm always testing to

1080
00:46:54,900 --> 00:47:00,539
see how it looks with my life so yeah

1081
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:02,219
the question is is you're gonna keep

1082
00:47:00,539 --> 00:47:04,529
learning every day you know what it

1083
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:06,119
takes it takes the rest of your life to

1084
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:06,540
understand it and then you'll get used

1085
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:08,279
to it

1086
00:47:06,539 --> 00:47:09,690
I know it works for me you know what I

1087
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:11,420
mean my stuff doesn't go away like

1088
00:47:09,690 --> 00:47:14,610
everybody else everybody we deal with

1089
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:17,400
and that's what I want you to point out

1090
00:47:14,610 --> 00:47:19,860
is that it takes time and one of the

1091
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:22,079
frustrations if patients come to me and

1092
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:24,539
they expect since we have such this wide

1093
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:26,880
variety of what immediately is going to

1094
00:47:24,539 --> 00:47:29,940
work for them and I have to back them

1095
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:31,559
off to that constant reality that some

1096
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:32,700
of this may not even work for you at all

1097
00:47:31,559 --> 00:47:34,079
and you're gonna have to go through a

1098
00:47:32,699 --> 00:47:36,359
trial and error just because it's called

1099
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:38,670
marijuana it doesn't mean there's just

1100
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:41,190
one fail swoop of marijuana and to make

1101
00:47:38,670 --> 00:47:43,920
them aware of now they have to figure

1102
00:47:41,190 --> 00:47:46,200
out what works for them that's basically

1103
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:48,420
what I'm talking about is finding out

1104
00:47:46,199 --> 00:47:50,339
after your condition and then finding

1105
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:53,039
something that is beneficial for you

1106
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:56,130
takes a deal of time and unfortunately

1107
00:47:53,039 --> 00:47:57,690
people expect because of Western modern

1108
00:47:56,130 --> 00:47:58,860
medicine that the pill I'm going to take

1109
00:47:57,690 --> 00:48:00,750
is going to have an immediate effect

1110
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:03,120
they expect that same thing with

1111
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:06,000
cannabis and it can be true in in some

1112
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:08,940
cases to most cases but in some cases

1113
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:11,219
it's not the case at all 33

1114
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:13,440
pharmaceutical drugs I took a day they

1115
00:48:11,219 --> 00:48:14,519
changed my medication so many times

1116
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:16,329
because they didn't know what was

1117
00:48:14,519 --> 00:48:18,280
working for what's going on with me

1118
00:48:16,329 --> 00:48:20,110
it's the same thing it's true that's

1119
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:21,730
what the doctors do to ninety percent of

1120
00:48:20,110 --> 00:48:23,590
the patients out there you can always

1121
00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:25,329
try this ad and I'll try an oxycontin

1122
00:48:23,590 --> 00:48:27,670
and try and morphine we'll try this

1123
00:48:25,329 --> 00:48:29,409
sudden I mean they try so many because

1124
00:48:27,670 --> 00:48:30,610
you know what it's the same with canvas

1125
00:48:29,409 --> 00:48:32,739
you can find some that's in the work

1126
00:48:30,610 --> 00:48:34,300
Marc did it with me with the turf means

1127
00:48:32,739 --> 00:48:36,459
when those terpenes wonder Neath my nose

1128
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:39,580
after surgery not one turfing what that

1129
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:41,769
did to me it it put another thought my

1130
00:48:39,579 --> 00:48:43,929
brain how much that helps so much so

1131
00:48:41,769 --> 00:48:46,030
it's really like I say for patients you

1132
00:48:43,929 --> 00:48:48,279
get a chance starts smelling all the

1133
00:48:46,030 --> 00:48:50,080
different profiles and that one that

1134
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:51,670
lights up your brain it's the one that

1135
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:54,849
you want to look at and start taking a

1136
00:48:51,670 --> 00:48:56,590
look at the TCC me levels are CBN levels

1137
00:48:54,849 --> 00:48:58,750
are the cannabinoid profile to see now

1138
00:48:56,590 --> 00:49:01,990
now you got that her peanuts working for

1139
00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:03,820
now start trying to dial in the

1140
00:49:01,989 --> 00:49:06,729
cannabinoids in a way so I guess that's

1141
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:08,200
what I've been doing over time just

1142
00:49:06,730 --> 00:49:09,760
thinking about it that's what I mean I

1143
00:49:08,199 --> 00:49:11,109
mean seeing what works for me and then

1144
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,820
developing the cannabinoids in the

1145
00:49:11,110 --> 00:49:15,309
ratios that works for me throughout the

1146
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:17,200
net but Sammy took it to a whole other

1147
00:49:15,309 --> 00:49:18,880
level for the rest of the world when you

1148
00:49:17,199 --> 00:49:28,239
couldn't find what you wanted and you

1149
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:34,329
created skunk amongst others classical

1150
00:49:28,239 --> 00:49:36,309
plant breeding and if if I wouldn't have

1151
00:49:34,329 --> 00:49:38,739
done it then there would have been some

1152
00:49:36,309 --> 00:49:40,900
other variety that would have been the

1153
00:49:38,739 --> 00:49:45,279
first one that was widely distributed so

1154
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:48,280
it's I just happen to be there at the

1155
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:54,190
time the happy accidents they're lucky

1156
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:58,210
miracle mix skunk III I think what's

1157
00:49:54,190 --> 00:50:00,130
really really important is well depends

1158
00:49:58,210 --> 00:50:01,500
for medical and recreational it's a

1159
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:07,090
little bit different but for

1160
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:11,019
recreational it's lots of THC with the

1161
00:50:07,090 --> 00:50:14,440
turbine that you terpenes excuse me that

1162
00:50:11,019 --> 00:50:16,659
you prefer and of course that can be

1163
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:20,010
bred for it just like cannabinoids can

1164
00:50:16,659 --> 00:50:24,309
be bred for either for or against and

1165
00:50:20,010 --> 00:50:28,240
it's in the future that will be we will

1166
00:50:24,309 --> 00:50:29,179
have varieties that are so much higher

1167
00:50:28,239 --> 00:50:32,328
in Turkey

1168
00:50:29,179 --> 00:50:35,838
content because people really like these

1169
00:50:32,329 --> 00:50:40,400
and they really do modify the effects

1170
00:50:35,838 --> 00:50:44,690
and potentiation dat true and you gotta

1171
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:47,358
think if you take a cultivar that's like

1172
00:50:44,690 --> 00:50:50,358
five and make a concentrate with it that

1173
00:50:47,358 --> 00:50:52,730
the level of terpenes is going to be off

1174
00:50:50,358 --> 00:50:56,029
the chart probably higher than what we

1175
00:50:52,730 --> 00:50:59,119
are even putting in these pens yeah well

1176
00:50:56,030 --> 00:51:02,420
it used to be that one two percent was

1177
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:05,329
pretty normal better being content then

1178
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:08,300
people started noticing that there were

1179
00:51:05,329 --> 00:51:13,609
three fours and five percents that will

1180
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:16,970
ruin the the Emerald cup and events like

1181
00:51:13,608 --> 00:51:22,279
this because high turbine content is

1182
00:51:16,969 --> 00:51:25,338
consistently blamed with winning of

1183
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:31,040
these cannabis cups people like the high

1184
00:51:25,338 --> 00:51:33,440
terpene contents and I there are

1185
00:51:31,039 --> 00:51:37,358
varieties that exists that are as high

1186
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:43,338
as 10% but have been created by man

1187
00:51:37,358 --> 00:51:48,318
well normal breeding but man bred not

1188
00:51:43,338 --> 00:51:50,119
just found in nature I want to say thank

1189
00:51:48,318 --> 00:51:51,469
you and as well as reflecting many of

1190
00:51:50,119 --> 00:51:53,480
the people in chat just wanted to say

1191
00:51:51,469 --> 00:51:55,789
thank you Sam for your creations over

1192
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:57,769
the years once again used to still don't

1193
00:51:55,789 --> 00:51:59,420
think you get enough love for what

1194
00:51:57,769 --> 00:52:01,548
you've done for the world of cannabis

1195
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:03,710
and now it's becoming more and more

1196
00:52:01,548 --> 00:52:05,630
normalized for people in certain states

1197
00:52:03,710 --> 00:52:07,699
and in time and will become more and

1198
00:52:05,630 --> 00:52:10,490
more normalized in other states and in

1199
00:52:07,699 --> 00:52:12,048
other countries and you know you late

1200
00:52:10,489 --> 00:52:13,578
you later groundwork be at the happy

1201
00:52:12,048 --> 00:52:15,318
accident that it was that I could have

1202
00:52:13,579 --> 00:52:17,510
been somewhere else it wasn't someone

1203
00:52:15,318 --> 00:52:21,440
else it happened to be you so thank you

1204
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:24,260
and 75 there was no cannabis seed

1205
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:28,429
companies hardly anybody knew how to

1206
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:31,040
make clones and very few people who are

1207
00:52:28,429 --> 00:52:35,088
using artificial lights few people were

1208
00:52:31,039 --> 00:52:37,608
using fluorescence but 75 there weren't

1209
00:52:35,088 --> 00:52:41,779
that many people using metal halides

1210
00:52:37,608 --> 00:52:42,900
maybe a couple and all those are the

1211
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:46,380
events that

1212
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:52,680
changed cannabis and made it unstoppable

1213
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:54,450
and completely uncontrollable and yeah I

1214
00:52:52,679 --> 00:52:56,098
didn't realize what until I was you know

1215
00:52:54,449 --> 00:52:57,989
doing it I didn't realize that you know

1216
00:52:56,099 --> 00:53:00,240
cloning cannabis didn't really start

1217
00:52:57,989 --> 00:53:03,298
until the early 70s as well so that's

1218
00:53:00,239 --> 00:53:05,608
that's a key way of spreading genetics

1219
00:53:03,298 --> 00:53:07,259
that I mean back when I was you know

1220
00:53:05,608 --> 00:53:09,239
definitely it's passed the statue of

1221
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:12,170
limitation so background pumping out

1222
00:53:09,239 --> 00:53:14,519
5000 clothes a week I was in utilizing

1223
00:53:12,170 --> 00:53:16,740
genetics that were going out there and I

1224
00:53:14,519 --> 00:53:18,719
started to think of who started this

1225
00:53:16,739 --> 00:53:22,048
originally because back in the day was

1226
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:24,750
only see yeah you didn't need to clone

1227
00:53:22,048 --> 00:53:29,519
until you had lights then you need to

1228
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:31,710
maintain your best preps true story

1229
00:53:29,519 --> 00:53:34,139
yeah either you maintain them or lose

1230
00:53:31,710 --> 00:53:36,000
them and we've lost many many genetics

1231
00:53:34,139 --> 00:53:38,639
over the years because they weren't

1232
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:40,679
necessarily maintained or happy

1233
00:53:38,639 --> 00:53:43,038
accidents happen such as hermaphrodites

1234
00:53:40,679 --> 00:53:46,259
or males it's happened to slip in

1235
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:50,670
somewhere and a pollen in and next thing

1236
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:52,470
you know your crops changed that's why

1237
00:53:50,670 --> 00:53:54,240
it's good to share your cuts it's good

1238
00:53:52,469 --> 00:53:56,459
to share your cuts it's good to share

1239
00:53:54,239 --> 00:53:58,199
your cuts if you can get them out there

1240
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:59,940
at least to a couple of people have them

1241
00:53:58,199 --> 00:54:01,649
get them out to a couple of people I

1242
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:06,480
mean it's not the worst thing I know

1243
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:10,528
everyone's worried keep a clone easy for

1244
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:13,710
25 years I've done it but they can pick

1245
00:54:10,528 --> 00:54:16,829
up viruses so you have to be careful

1246
00:54:13,710 --> 00:54:21,858
that you don't have insect vectors or

1247
00:54:16,829 --> 00:54:26,910
other problems which are spreading virus

1248
00:54:21,858 --> 00:54:33,028
what that can do is really reduce yield

1249
00:54:26,909 --> 00:54:36,328
and bigger of your clone right how does

1250
00:54:33,028 --> 00:54:39,059
one look for that Sam how does one when

1251
00:54:36,329 --> 00:54:43,528
that starts to happen there are tests

1252
00:54:39,059 --> 00:54:46,079
and that one of the the needs up there

1253
00:54:43,528 --> 00:54:48,028
by Davis in the wine industry was

1254
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:51,450
offering to do it for cannabis people

1255
00:54:48,028 --> 00:54:54,179
and yeah I don't have a lot of

1256
00:54:51,449 --> 00:54:55,960
experience I know that there is a bunch

1257
00:54:54,179 --> 00:54:59,489
of viruses which have been

1258
00:54:55,960 --> 00:55:02,710
in cannabis and some of them are fairly

1259
00:54:59,489 --> 00:55:05,709
free say they don't cause economic

1260
00:55:02,710 --> 00:55:17,108
damage and other ones are quite economic

1261
00:55:05,710 --> 00:55:19,630
causing damage Oh some viruses are

1262
00:55:17,108 --> 00:55:24,098
spurred by seed - people think if you

1263
00:55:19,630 --> 00:55:40,240
grow from tea no that's true some

1264
00:55:24,099 --> 00:55:42,660
viruses are can be spread by seed three

1265
00:55:40,239 --> 00:55:42,659
more hours

1266
00:55:48,179 --> 00:55:56,319
well 2017 High Times Cannabis Cup Canada

1267
00:55:53,619 --> 00:55:59,170
is just around the corner there's been

1268
00:55:56,320 --> 00:56:02,440
some pretty big changes with the

1269
00:55:59,170 --> 00:56:07,180
changing of the whole Cup and they got W

1270
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:08,380
Y genes was it a logical gene or

1271
00:56:07,179 --> 00:56:09,848
whatever I don't even though they don't

1272
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:11,170
probably saying it wrong we've got a few

1273
00:56:09,849 --> 00:56:14,920
good artists haven't even released the

1274
00:56:11,170 --> 00:56:19,720
main app memo so it's really filling up

1275
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:22,510
and changing they were you just trying

1276
00:56:19,719 --> 00:56:26,549
to say Wyclef Jean yes say thank you my

1277
00:56:22,510 --> 00:56:26,550
question what were you saying I was

1278
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:34,570
wrong my name is my club yahwah why i

1279
00:56:32,650 --> 00:56:36,579
was taking a rip out of my pen knock I

1280
00:56:34,570 --> 00:56:41,740
was kind of listening but not really and

1281
00:56:36,579 --> 00:56:47,348
then I was like what W clap I'm like I

1282
00:56:41,739 --> 00:56:49,449
never said that I a [ __ ] funny dude

1283
00:56:47,349 --> 00:56:52,599
ah you know what it's looking pretty

1284
00:56:49,449 --> 00:57:01,919
pretty pretty awesome we know Johnny's

1285
00:56:52,599 --> 00:57:07,440
not a music promoter [ __ ] wyc LEF

1286
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:08,579
yeah that fellow with the cliff I

1287
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:11,730
I get have to listen someone's music

1288

00:58:47,130 --> 00:58:54,480
think everything that you're gonna need

00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:55,920
is there no no it's it's really easy

1331
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:57,210
it's like all the other hard time canvas

1332
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:58,349
cups they have all over the world and

1333
00:58:57,210 --> 00:59:00,869
stuff like that and I'm really looking

1334
00:58:58,349 --> 00:59:02,400
forward to do it now it's not just like

1335
00:59:00,869 --> 00:59:05,099
all the other cannabis come well that's

1336
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:07,289
how much country just decided to make it

1337
00:59:05,099 --> 00:59:09,750
a High Times Cannabis Cup what three

1338
00:59:07,289 --> 00:59:12,090
weeks before the event a couple weeks

1339
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:14,280
before the so that that to me is a minor

1340
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:16,470
spider sense my spider sense tingling

1341
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:18,390
when I was asked about it because I I

1342
00:59:16,469 --> 00:59:18,989
like the I listen I know high times

1343
00:59:18,389 --> 00:59:20,489
bring

1344
00:59:18,989 --> 00:59:24,059
for me what they've always done is

1345
00:59:20,489 --> 00:59:26,609
they've been able to bring an audience

1346
00:59:24,059 --> 00:59:28,529
where if I'm gonna go do business it's

1347
00:59:26,610 --> 00:59:31,470
worth while for me to do business I know

1348
00:59:28,530 --> 00:59:33,119
High Times can bring the group but that

1349
00:59:31,469 --> 00:59:35,789
being said that usually takes them six

1350
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:38,610
plus months of advertising and

1351
00:59:35,789 --> 00:59:41,460
promotions and magazines and videos and

1352
00:59:38,610 --> 00:59:43,710
social media postings and so three weeks

1353
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:45,000
to take over this BC one just made me

1354
00:59:43,710 --> 00:59:46,139
nervous I know you'll be there and

1355
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,480
you'll check it out and give us an

1356
00:59:46,139 --> 00:59:50,789
honest review I know you even enjoyed it

1357
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:52,110
last year although I did hear some one

1358
00:59:50,789 --> 00:59:54,029
guy got punched in the face or something

1359
00:59:52,110 --> 00:59:56,039
there was like a alcohol cannabis

1360
00:59:54,030 --> 00:59:59,040
mixture thing going on that hopefully

1361
00:59:56,039 --> 01:00:01,769
they figure out this year I hope for the

1362
00:59:59,039 --> 01:00:04,349
best but I won't be there myself I'm I

1363
01:00:01,769 --> 01:00:08,009
know we'll be there are your stickers I

1364
01:00:04,349 --> 01:00:10,049
don't want you there and in spirit and I

1365
01:00:08,010 --> 01:00:12,300
know that hard times just taking over

1366
01:00:10,050 --> 01:00:13,800
there's me a lot of big different

1367
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:16,769
vendors who come in they don't go by X

1368
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:18,960
150 booze they got people coming in from

1369
01:00:16,769 --> 01:00:20,250
all over Europe there's be certain

1370
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:24,030
things I've already completely sold out

1371
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:26,699
so it has changed High Times comes with

1372
01:00:24,030 --> 01:00:28,710
their whole entourage so for sure I just

1373
01:00:26,699 --> 01:00:30,750
like settling in over two weeks

1374
01:00:28,710 --> 01:00:35,039

oh we're not gonna have time to prepare

1382
01:00:47,039 --> 01:00:53,369
for that I like a little bit of time

1383
01:00:51,420 --> 01:00:55,320
maybe preparing this for probably about

1384
01:00:53,369 --> 01:00:57,269
a month no stuff like that but it'll

1385
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:59,010
definitely be the first one it'll be fun

1386
01:00:57,269 --> 01:01:00,509
we'll look forward to the year after

1387
01:00:59,010 --> 01:01:04,109

01:01:21,449 --> 01:01:24,210
come home for the part of the year

1397
01:01:22,409 --> 01:01:26,549
always say if you're in cannabis if you

1398
01:01:24,210 --> 01:01:28,400
can make it make sure you bring a tent

1399
01:01:26,550 --> 01:01:31,500
because it's camping there's no hotels

1400
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:32,338
there's uh no it's not like that but

1401
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:35,278
they do have

1402
01:01:32,338 --> 01:01:38,400
full shower facilities bathrooms it's

1403
01:01:35,278 --> 01:01:39,900
it's it's not like and it's got some

1404
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:41,880
luxury camping involved to it and

1405
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:43,619
punishing got this huge cannabis village

1406
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:46,650
there's some like I said the event has

1407
01:01:43,619 --> 01:01:47,880
changed quite a bit in the last just 48

1408
01:01:46,650 --> 01:01:50,369
hours with the amount of people coming

1409
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:54,690
in the new vendors coming in and and are

1410
01:01:50,369 --> 01:01:56,009
the tragically hip still playing I don't

1411
01:01:54,690 --> 01:01:57,900
know what's going on with that whole

1412
01:01:56,009 --> 01:01:59,130
thing at all zero they were talks about

1413
01:01:57,900 --> 01:02:00,778
that in the beginning but I mean maybe

1414
01:01:59,130 --> 01:02:03,119
that was just a laugh their city they

1415
01:02:00,778 --> 01:02:05,670
haven't announced the main event yet

1416
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:08,219
that will be for Saturday so we're

1417
01:02:05,670 --> 01:02:11,130
waiting on that there's some rumors of

1418
01:02:08,219 --> 01:02:12,989
what's happening and who's coming in but

1419
01:02:11,130 --> 01:02:14,278
everything's rumored right now high

1420
01:02:12,989 --> 01:02:15,929
times just holding that tight to the

1421
01:02:14,278 --> 01:02:18,630
chest and what you're opposed sooner

1422
01:02:15,929 --> 01:02:19,978
than later and when it does that's why

1423
01:02:18,630 --> 01:02:21,390
they moved their vendors village because

1424
01:02:19,978 --> 01:02:23,788
they anticipate it's gonna pack the

1425
01:02:21,389 --> 01:02:25,618
whole area when Venezuelan vendors

1426
01:02:23,789 --> 01:02:27,569
village was last year so they

1427
01:02:25,619 --> 01:02:29,579
anticipated such a big volume people

1428
01:02:27,568 --> 01:02:31,528
coming on the Saturday that they moved

1429
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:32,640
the whole village out of the way for the

1430
01:02:31,528 --> 01:02:34,228
mountain people so they're really

1431
01:02:32,639 --> 01:02:35,788
preparing this there's a different

1432
01:02:34,228 --> 01:02:38,129
security they've mentioned putting in

1433
01:02:35,789 --> 01:02:40,140
for road and stuff like that for access

1434
01:02:38,130 --> 01:02:41,608
we're gonna get in so there's being some

1435
01:02:40,139 --> 01:02:43,108
pretty big changes and some pretty good

1436
01:02:41,608 --> 01:02:45,659
changes so we're we looking forward to

1437
01:02:43,108 --> 01:02:47,429
it for sure very cool excellent well

1438
01:02:45,659 --> 01:02:49,739

doing her cup for four years straight

1451
01:03:11,849 --> 01:03:17,940
one of the sort of strong Canadian

1452
01:03:14,478 --> 01:03:18,808
cannabis events much smaller no

1453
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:21,450
Camping's

in the city only a couple of days but

1455
01:03:21,449 --> 01:03:25,768
still pretty damn fun good gathering

1456
01:03:23,608 --> 01:03:27,719
still kind of rootsy like what you might

1457
01:03:25,768 --> 01:03:29,848
say like what the cannabis cup was like

1458
01:03:27,719 --> 01:03:31,979
you know 20 years ago or it's still a

1459
01:03:29,849 --> 01:03:35,249
little bit of a smaller event but but

1460
01:03:31,978 --> 01:03:38,578
very very good a lot of people's good

1461
01:03:35,248 --> 01:03:41,278
speakers good booths and just a fun kind

1462
01:03:38,579 --> 01:03:44,099
of very different vibe almost the polar

1463
01:03:41,278 --> 01:03:46,050
opposite of the camping British Columbia

1464
01:03:44,099 --> 01:03:49,530
experience this is like a

1465
01:03:46,050 --> 01:03:52,769
the Toronto experience but if Sarah will

1466
01:03:49,530 --> 01:03:55,200
be a celebrity judge at the High Times

1467
01:03:52,769 --> 01:03:58,440
cop and definitely

1468
01:03:55,199 --> 01:04:01,559
yeah serous cup is like he said it's

1469
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:03,809
definitely some more roots it was it was

1470
01:04:01,559 --> 01:04:05,210
quite quite an experience when I was out

1471
01:04:03,809 --> 01:04:08,130
they lost you had a really good time

1472
01:04:05,210 --> 01:04:09,929
yeah I was good last year I had a I'm

1473
01:04:08,130 --> 01:04:12,300
going back this year again for that very

1474
01:04:09,929 --> 01:04:15,359
reason just to uh rock it out again

1475
01:04:12,300 --> 01:04:17,490
hopefully it's uh hopefully it's as good

1476
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:19,680
as last year always hoping for the best

1477
01:04:17,489 --> 01:04:21,479
with these events I I just don't do as

1478
01:04:19,679 --> 01:04:24,269
many of them anymore I am much more

1479
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:28,019
picky these days I think I miss like 80%

1480
01:04:24,269 --> 01:04:30,809
of the events and go to maybe 20% of the

1481

1499
01:05:15,570 --> 01:05:19,019
hasn't been a change in those bands but

1500
01:05:17,250 --> 01:05:20,730
they've added some other bigger bands to

1501
01:05:19,019 --> 01:05:23,369

1555
01:07:41,050 --> 01:07:48,519

01:07:43,030 --> 01:07:50,140
at 4:20 a.m. interrupt both youth

1557

says likes to talk to customs B man does

1559
01:07:54,159 --> 01:07:58,929
not well it's not that Johnny B likes to

1560
01:07:56,469 --> 01:08:03,789
talk to customs and fellow man doesn't

1561
01:07:58,929 --> 01:08:05,859
it's just that Johnny B wasn't it didn't

1562
01:08:03,789 --> 01:08:08,139
Johnny B call that lady a [ __ ] or

1563
01:08:05,860 --> 01:08:09,789
something like that it customs that was

1564
01:08:08,139 --> 01:08:10,949
a different time that was that could

1565
01:08:09,789 --> 01:08:12,599
that could be marked

1566
01:08:10,949 --> 01:08:14,219
that could be marked in the airport for

1567
01:08:12,599 --> 01:08:17,159
sure

1568
01:08:14,219 --> 01:08:18,988
the custom-bike told me he goes but I

1569
01:08:17,159 --> 01:08:20,039
could talk to interesting people so he

1570
01:08:18,988 --> 01:08:21,358
slayed me because he thought I was

1571
01:08:20,039 --> 01:08:24,600
interesting to talk to

1572
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:25,949
dude dude that's so not what happened

1573
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:28,500
you looked like an utter and complete

1574
01:08:25,948 --> 01:08:30,629
sketch ball your hair was pointing out

1575
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:31,770
in every direction he asked you what you

1576
01:08:30,630 --> 01:08:35,039
were doing and you said you were

1577
01:08:31,770 --> 01:08:40,650
training doctors that's why he wanted to

1578
01:08:35,039 --> 01:08:42,119
touch my god not to mention here here's

1579
01:08:40,649 --> 01:08:45,269
another poor thing that happened that is

1580
01:08:42,119 --> 01:08:46,829
was not Johnny B's fault didn't they

1581
01:08:45,270 --> 01:08:49,080
lose your luggage or something or no you

1582
01:08:46,829 --> 01:08:51,269

1583
01:08:49,079 --> 01:08:54,179
gonna fly back you only had clothes for

1584
01:08:51,270 --> 01:08:57,150
two days he ended up staying for like

1585
01:08:54,179 --> 01:08:59,640
three extra days with only this set of

1586
01:08:57,149 --> 01:09:01,920
clothes so the shirt that he passed

1587
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:04,469
through customs with he had worn for

1588
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:05,819
like three days straight so that was

1589
01:09:04,469 --> 01:09:08,219
also not his fault

1590
01:09:05,819 --> 01:09:12,210
he didn't have the like I always ice

1591
01:09:08,219 --> 01:09:14,179
[ __ ] you know I save an outfit that

1592
01:09:12,210 --> 01:09:17,009
means think what happened in Jamaica

1593
01:09:14,179 --> 01:09:20,310
just happened so we spent the next day

1594
01:09:17,009 --> 01:09:22,619

1620
01:10:11,939 --> 01:10:15,029
what works for me I can say that's what

1621
01:10:13,710 --> 01:10:16,679
it's taking years and know exactly what

1622
01:10:15,029 --> 01:10:18,809
straight and what cushions work for me

1623
01:10:16,679 --> 01:10:21,480
because I could smells like that's what

1624
01:10:18,810 --> 01:10:23,760
works gonna have that please yeah for

1625
01:10:21,479 --> 01:10:24,329
sure well we got right lit sitting there

1626
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:27,300
and talking

1627
01:10:24,329 --> 01:10:29,819
Archy and Shawn was also there a friend

1628
01:10:27,300 --> 01:10:33,720
of ours from Jamaica which was oh it's

1629
01:10:29,819 --> 01:10:35,609
always nice to see familiar faces you

1630
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:37,320
know what we were talking about we're

1631
01:10:35,609 --> 01:10:38,819
doing there and educating on the pran

1632
01:10:37,319 --> 01:10:40,229
line and the hemp lines and stuff like

1633
01:10:38,819 --> 01:10:43,139
that and starting to see some of these

1634
01:10:40,229 --> 01:10:46,319
new products that have come to light

1635
01:10:43,140 --> 01:10:50,039
I dropped with cannabinoids in it nasal

1636
01:10:46,319 --> 01:10:52,380
sprays all kinds of the ordering stick

1637
01:10:50,039 --> 01:10:53,970
I'm seeing it's amazing the amount of

1638
01:10:52,380 --> 01:10:55,890
these raw ones and all these different

1639
01:10:53,970 --> 01:10:58,020
products are coming up with CBD now it's

1640
01:10:55,890 --> 01:10:59,369
not one but this it's loads of different

1641
01:10:58,020 --> 01:11:03,000
products like this that are happening

1642
01:10:59,369 --> 01:11:05,130
just wait wait when they release the

1643
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:06,750
rest of the cannabinoids you know even

1644
01:11:05,130 --> 01:11:08,369
though they haven't really released CBD

1645
01:11:06,750 --> 01:11:10,819
it's just what everyone thinks they have

1646
01:11:08,369 --> 01:11:13,739
and it's this weird kind of like social

1647
01:11:10,819 --> 01:11:15,420
distorted perspective on cannabinoids

1648
01:11:13,739 --> 01:11:16,829
that everyone's like oh it's the CVB's

1649
01:11:15,420 --> 01:11:19,140
like they're allowed to have the CBD

1650
01:11:16,829 --> 01:11:21,479
he's like I I get mine from Switzerland

1651
01:11:19,140 --> 01:11:23,640
and yeah it's the CBeebies it's like man

1652
01:11:21,479 --> 01:11:26,009
when they finally release this when

1653
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:28,789
banking federal banking is allowed and

1654
01:11:26,010 --> 01:11:31,079
like federal release of this like

1655
01:11:28,789 --> 01:11:33,659
ridiculous peace treaty that all these

1656
01:11:31,079 --> 01:11:36,390
countries the drunken narcotics peace

1657
01:11:33,659 --> 01:11:38,519
treaty act whatever it's called get rid

1658
01:11:36,390 --> 01:11:40,710
of it like let countries do what they

1659
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:43,230
want let people innovate how they want

1660
01:11:40,710 --> 01:11:45,569
let you know let the cream rise to the

1661
01:11:43,229 --> 01:11:49,169
top it's gonna be ridiculous how much

1662
01:11:45,569 --> 01:11:51,529
[ __ ] we see in our lifetime in regards

1663
01:11:49,170 --> 01:11:55,980
to you know new unique amazing

1664
01:11:51,529 --> 01:11:59,939
cannabinoid and terpene products seeing

1665
01:11:55,979 --> 01:12:04,109
it now think so already just hidden it's

1666
01:11:59,939 --> 01:12:05,309
like it's amazing the thing is just

1667
01:12:04,109 --> 01:12:07,649
seeing it now just the amount of

1668
01:12:05,310 --> 01:12:11,970
products that are coming up it's like 70

1669
01:12:07,649 --> 01:12:13,319
words think I drop sprays are coming on

1670
01:12:11,970 --> 01:12:16,170
probably yeah there's so much stuff

1671
01:12:13,319 --> 01:12:19,259
coming out there with anything to infuse

1672
01:12:16,170 --> 01:12:22,409
it families into your system so you know

1673
01:12:19,260 --> 01:12:24,150
smoke it or taste it you know well it's

1674
01:12:22,409 --> 01:12:25,889
cool too the way it happened because you

1675
01:12:24,149 --> 01:12:27,629
know prohibition wanted to keep us in

1676
01:12:25,890 --> 01:12:30,360
the dark ages forever but before

1677
01:12:27,630 --> 01:12:32,340
prohibition fell we took ourselves out

1678
01:12:30,359 --> 01:12:34,049
of the dark ages you know from just like

1679
01:12:32,340 --> 01:12:36,480
rolling spliffs to learning about

1680
01:12:34,050 --> 01:12:37,380
concentrates and isolating separating

1681
01:12:36,479 --> 01:12:40,289
terpenes

1682
01:12:37,380 --> 01:12:43,020
cannabinoids and just learning so much

1683
01:12:40,289 --> 01:12:45,329
about the plants and and opening you

1684
01:12:43,020 --> 01:12:47,219
know the deeper in you go the bigger it

1685
01:12:45,329 --> 01:12:49,948
gets like Terrence says how come the

1686
01:12:47,219 --> 01:12:52,198
bigger in you go or the deeper in you go

1687
01:12:49,948 --> 01:12:54,719
the bigger it gets just seems to work

1688
01:12:52,198 --> 01:12:57,299
like that with cannabis it's an endless

1689
01:12:54,719 --> 01:13:01,260
you get lifetimes you could do lifetimes

1690
01:12:57,300 --> 01:13:04,409
on this plant no problem no matter how

1691
01:13:01,260 --> 01:13:11,610
many questions you answer also does this

1692
01:13:04,408 --> 01:13:13,439
raise more questions it's true someone's

1693
01:13:11,609 --> 01:13:16,859
asking me what my take on tolerance

1694
01:13:13,439 --> 01:13:18,448
brakes are useful or pointless well you

1695
01:13:16,859 --> 01:13:20,609
know tolerance breaks are good if you

1696
01:13:18,448 --> 01:13:22,559
have resin that has a ceiling if you've

1697
01:13:20,609 --> 01:13:24,929
somehow acquired some like low quality

1698
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:27,289
resin that just has a ceiling that every

1699
01:13:24,929 --> 01:13:29,969
time you hit it it doesn't elevate you

1700
01:13:27,289 --> 01:13:33,090
then a tolerance break might be amazing

1701
01:13:29,969 --> 01:13:36,329
however better than a tolerance break in

1702
01:13:33,090 --> 01:13:39,659
my opinion is growing better resin you

1703
01:13:36,329 --> 01:13:42,059
know creating better plants making

1704
01:13:39,658 --> 01:13:45,210
better isolates so that when you want

1705
01:13:42,060 --> 01:13:47,159
those effects regardless of how many

1706
01:13:45,210 --> 01:13:50,219
times you like I'll tell you for sure

1707
01:13:47,158 --> 01:13:51,629
like the first time I met Sam well not

1708
01:13:50,219 --> 01:13:54,480
the first time I met him the first time

1709
01:13:51,630 --> 01:13:57,420
I smoked his hash on a grand scale like

1710
01:13:54,479 --> 01:14:00,238
I got to hit many many times I couldn't

1711
01:13:57,420 --> 01:14:03,270
believe that every time I hit it it got

1712
01:14:00,238 --> 01:14:06,000
me much much much higher like it wasn't

1713
01:14:03,270 --> 01:14:08,219
it was incredible like how high how high

1714
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,869
can you get it almost felt like the

1715
01:14:08,219 --> 01:14:13,020
difference between just like eating a

1716
01:14:09,869 --> 01:14:14,789
tab of acid and eating like 25 tabs of

1717
01:14:13,020 --> 01:14:16,350
acid where you're like literally become

1718
01:14:14,789 --> 01:14:18,750
pure light and you're just sitting there

1719
01:14:16,350 --> 01:14:20,699
that's how I remember it anyway and

1720
01:14:18,750 --> 01:14:22,889
don't get me wrong I was smoking some

1721
01:14:20,698 --> 01:14:25,259
pretty good resin prior to that full

1722
01:14:22,889 --> 01:14:27,750
melt drips through the screen like it

1723
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:30,179
just wasn't you know it wasn't the

1724
01:14:27,750 --> 01:14:32,520
strong genetics that he had it was

1725
01:14:30,179 --> 01:14:35,010
probably some weird hermaphroditic

1726
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:37,860
version because Renee in my opinion is a

1727
01:14:35,010 --> 01:14:41,310
skunk number one you know mutant or

1728
01:14:37,859 --> 01:14:43,859
cross hybrid something they said it was

1729
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:45,659
a Himalayan sativa crossed with a skunk

1730
01:14:43,859 --> 01:14:48,089
number one but that sounded like more

1731
01:14:45,658 --> 01:14:49,929
rumor than anything I never really put

1732
01:14:48,090 --> 01:14:52,599
much stock into it

1733
01:14:49,929 --> 01:15:00,340
it was a very nice smile at Jenny looked

1734
01:14:52,599 --> 01:15:07,840
almost smitten honeybee he's packing it

1735
01:15:00,340 --> 01:15:10,840
up packing up the old doubler this is um

1736
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:13,029
yeah an old double Butler actually my

1737
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:15,429
girl lethal oscillate as she made this

1738
01:15:13,029 --> 01:15:18,668
and this is she gave this to me about a

1739
01:15:15,429 --> 01:15:20,679
year ago right now when I first met her

1740
01:15:18,668 --> 01:15:22,389
well I met her 50 fine but this is when

1741
01:15:20,679 --> 01:15:24,729
we it's kind of like our anniversary's

1742
01:15:22,389 --> 01:15:26,050
coming up and I remember waking up in

1743
01:15:24,729 --> 01:15:29,469
the morning and finding this pipe

1744
01:15:26,050 --> 01:15:31,538
sitting in my my little area here and

1745
01:15:29,469 --> 01:15:35,498
there was a short gift she gave me so

1746
01:15:31,538 --> 01:15:36,728
yeah nice and I've always missing her

1747
01:15:35,498 --> 01:15:38,349
ever since I'm never really taking it

1748
01:15:36,729 --> 01:15:39,939
out of here I always just come in here

1749
01:15:38,349 --> 01:15:43,708
like how my local traditions and this is

1750
01:15:39,939 --> 01:15:50,829

1754
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:59,199
kind of tight I thought we're gonna be

1755
01:15:57,609 --> 01:16:01,179
doing some squishing live I'm talking

1756
01:15:59,198 --> 01:16:02,859
about that stuff well I kind of was

1757
01:16:01,179 --> 01:16:05,050
feeling it but at the same time I'd

1758
01:16:02,859 --> 01:16:06,969
rather have soil grown and the Sasquatch

1759
01:16:05,050 --> 01:16:10,269
crew in here and really believe in that

1760
01:16:06,969 --> 01:16:15,578
video so have like a stacked rosin panel

1761
01:16:10,269 --> 01:16:18,128
for come on show I don't even have it

1762
01:16:15,578 --> 01:16:25,029
turned on I gotta get up and go around

are they mold fishing huh I'm being for

1790
01:17:51,729 --> 01:17:56,049
a few years used to fish a lot but you

1791
01:17:54,039 --> 01:17:58,029
sit on the river and they go 4 or 5 a.m.

1792
01:17:56,050 --> 01:17:59,920
is that some well you see just everybody

1793
01:17:58,029 --> 01:18:01,599
to see big fatties being burnt you see

1794
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:03,969
the big cherries you know who's on the

1795
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:05,500
river well someone's over there let me

1796
01:18:03,969 --> 01:18:06,819
not have some of the guys on the river

1797
01:18:05,500 --> 01:18:08,679
if they do and you think I'm they got

1798
01:18:06,819 --> 01:18:10,479
their blazons there they're up there

1799
01:18:08,679 --> 01:18:11,920
earlier they disable the engine of

1800
01:18:10,479 --> 01:18:13,119
there's reasons why they're on the river

1801
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:14,920
and they're just like anything morning

1802
01:18:13,119 --> 01:18:18,510
rises love the fish but I mean it's uh

1803
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:21,069
it's definitely if you're out there

1804
01:18:18,510 --> 01:18:22,449
where you're I've been fishing out there

1805
01:18:21,069 --> 01:18:24,759
on the veter and everything but I've

1806
01:18:22,448 --> 01:18:27,460
also fists on rivers where you're you

1807
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:30,880
know six feet apart from people taking

1808
01:18:27,460 --> 01:18:33,340
turns cos you got 12 14 foot rods going

1809
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:35,440
everywhere you get a fish on people are

1810
01:18:33,340 --> 01:18:37,539
reeling in the places that I'm going to

1811
01:18:35,439 --> 01:18:40,149
up here you take about three hours to

1812
01:18:37,539 --> 01:18:41,590
four hours just to drive into on dirt

1813
01:18:40,149 --> 01:18:43,629
roads you got to use a little for

1814
01:18:41,590 --> 01:18:46,210
wheeling and the place you're going

1815
01:18:43,630 --> 01:18:48,730
you're lucky to see anybody and that's

1816
01:18:46,210 --> 01:18:50,439
the perfect part because you're coming

1817
01:18:48,729 --> 01:18:52,959
on a riverbed and here you see in

1818
01:18:50,439 --> 01:18:55,419
wildlife you know it's it's it's

1819
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:57,489
beautiful country that you feel you

1820
01:18:55,420 --> 01:18:59,350
hasn't even been touched but other

1821
01:18:57,488 --> 01:19:01,718
people have been there had to find out

1822
01:18:59,350 --> 01:19:04,150
somehow as well tour these see good

1823
01:19:01,719 --> 01:19:07,600
spots right need an hour ago Darren he

1824
01:19:04,149 --> 01:19:10,929
can go well I've got my Rhino

1825
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:12,190
I go two spots but the farther you go

1826
01:19:10,929 --> 01:19:14,560
with the better the fishing you're

1827
01:19:12,189 --> 01:19:16,509
fishing and catching all day that's

1828
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:19,059
where that's fun

1829
01:19:16,510 --> 01:19:22,150
it's good to see Michigan catching I

1830
01:19:19,059 --> 01:19:25,079
think the Pink's are flowing up in here

1831
01:19:22,149 --> 01:19:27,518

1832
01:19:25,078 --> 01:19:28,868
co-host they're coming up I don't know

1833
01:19:27,519 --> 01:19:30,969
if they're gonna be open or not but

1834
01:19:28,868 --> 01:19:34,748

1835
01:19:30,969 --> 01:19:36,729

1836
01:19:34,748 --> 01:19:38,708
my boat later today not to go fishing

1837
01:19:36,729 --> 01:19:40,420
but to drive around cruise around maybe

1838
01:19:38,708 --> 01:19:42,939
check the water I saw herring jumping

1839
01:19:40,420 --> 01:19:45,399

1840
01:19:42,939 --> 01:19:55,618
Pink's coming in if not already so we'll

1841
01:19:45,399 --> 01:19:58,509
see what happens here pretty cool yeah

1842
01:19:55,618 --> 01:20:02,170
on the rivers and got some monster

1843
01:19:58,510 --> 01:20:04,119

1845
01:20:04,118 --> 01:20:09,038
caught on the kid in Mighty River Wow

1846
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:12,819
check out the ground - it's not no

1847
01:20:09,038 --> 01:20:14,380
[ __ ] proof is in the pictures poof

1848
01:20:12,819 --> 01:20:19,049

1849

Photoshop yeah I won't have in the shop

1850
01:20:19,050 --> 01:20:28,840
what's that Photoshop oh yeah

1851
01:20:27,158 --> 01:20:31,719
everybody's got something to say when it

1852
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:36,779
comes to the fish stories but videos

1853
01:20:31,719 --> 01:20:40,809
pictures I got if you had that you know

1854
01:20:36,779 --> 01:20:44,639
took the time to do that I guess I'd

1855
01:20:40,809 --> 01:20:44,639
rather take the time to go fishing I

1856
01:20:45,059 --> 01:20:52,869
like eating them but yeah fishing

1857
01:20:49,559 --> 01:20:56,829
I don't want to spend lots and lots of

1858
01:20:52,868 --> 01:21:00,368
time doing it although for example I'm

1859
01:20:56,828 --> 01:21:02,529
he did one of his left nut sport I guess

1860
01:21:00,368 --> 01:21:06,279
his left back because he doesn't have to

1861
01:21:02,529 --> 01:21:07,899
him Yeah right you only have one left

1862
01:21:06,279 --> 01:21:10,029
although I guess you could put the right

1863
01:21:07,899 --> 01:21:12,268
one in the left position and if you were

1864
01:21:10,029 --> 01:21:12,268
good

1865
01:21:14,470 --> 01:21:21,860

1869
01:21:27,319 --> 01:21:31,489

1873
01:21:38,090 --> 01:21:43,159

1874
01:21:41,329 --> 01:21:43,720

1875
01:21:43,159 --> 01:21:45,920
river

1876
01:21:43,720 --> 01:21:49,909
everyone quiet down to the river with

1877
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:52,430

will be happy I won't grow up here let a

1880
01:21:56,779 --> 01:22:00,380
little grow but it'll die before it

1881
01:21:58,609 --> 01:22:02,000
finishes because there's too cold

1882
01:22:00,380 --> 01:22:06,859
weathers already changing up here oh

1883
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:08,600
it's changing down here too can feel it

1884
01:22:06,859 --> 01:22:10,849
I was up in Whistler a couple days ago

1885
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:15,170
and I could really feel it there winter

1886
01:22:10,850 --> 01:22:18,230
is definitely just around the cold Lise

1887
01:22:15,170 --> 01:22:19,850
almost everything that I do catch unless

1888
01:22:18,229 --> 01:22:22,789
I'm gonna eat it I like keeping the

1889
01:22:19,850 --> 01:22:26,090
rainbows because we're allowed to it's

1890
01:22:22,789 --> 01:22:31,340
like to smoke those but we catch and

1891
01:22:26,090 --> 01:22:32,720
release most everything okay lots of

1892
01:22:31,340 --> 01:22:34,610
grab kit it's got to take them fishing

1893
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:37,159
to catch fish too if I fish them all

1894
01:22:34,609 --> 01:22:43,069
there won't be none right

1895
01:22:37,159 --> 01:22:50,029
I could fish them all nah you are a new

1896
01:22:43,069 --> 01:22:55,880
feet I hope so - my blood by blood I'll

1897
01:22:50,029 --> 01:22:58,939
do it fly fish fish fish fish yep fly

1898
01:22:55,880 --> 01:23:03,440
fish and casting I like all kinds the

1899
01:22:58,939 --> 01:23:05,029
coffee grinders the level winders I love

1900
01:23:03,439 --> 01:23:07,849
fly-fishing - there's something about

1901
01:23:05,029 --> 01:23:09,199
fly-fishing that really uh you know if

1902
01:23:07,850 --> 01:23:10,670
you're you go to the river you look

1903
01:23:09,199 --> 01:23:12,079
around you see the bugs that are on the

1904
01:23:10,670 --> 01:23:14,210
rocks you see the bugs that are flying

1905
01:23:12,079 --> 01:23:16,220
around you maps those ones you put it on

1906
01:23:14,210 --> 01:23:18,170
you let it float then you see it come

1907
01:23:16,220 --> 01:23:20,180
and take it

1908
01:23:18,170 --> 01:23:22,550
it's [ __ ] amazing when that happens

1909
01:23:20,180 --> 01:23:23,930
and you landed that real nicely - like

1910
01:23:22,550 --> 01:23:26,180
it's it's pretty neat when you trick

1911
01:23:23,930 --> 01:23:31,619
them that good

1912
01:23:26,180 --> 01:23:33,900
and lures or castings at all about David

1913
01:23:31,619 --> 01:23:35,939
David says why is that even fun to catch

1914
01:23:33,899 --> 01:23:37,829
a fish and put holes in their face and

1915
01:23:35,939 --> 01:23:40,319
then toss them back

1916
01:23:37,829 --> 01:23:42,869
he's a barkless hawk so it just comes on

1917
01:23:40,319 --> 01:23:44,639
as like a piercing humans do it's just

1918
01:23:42,869 --> 01:23:46,199
his perspective right because he's not a

1919
01:23:44,640 --> 01:23:48,570
fisherman you know what David you have

1920
01:23:46,199 --> 01:23:50,489

01:25:37,708 --> 01:25:47,488
fish story I have a fish story I was

1962
01:25:42,510 --> 01:25:49,349
much younger I went fishing outside of

1963
01:25:47,488 --> 01:25:50,759
Florida a little deep-sea on a three or

1964
01:25:49,349 --> 01:25:54,840
four day where you have to sleep on a

1965
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:57,329
boat and it sounds sounded like a really

1966
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:59,069
fun time and I think I was like 16 or 15

1967
01:25:57,328 --> 01:26:01,469
and I said yeah let's go out with my

1968
01:25:59,069 --> 01:26:04,859
brothers we're gonna we're gonna go out

1969
01:26:01,469 --> 01:26:08,519
on a deep sea fish in and basically uh

1970
01:26:04,859 --> 01:26:11,130
you know I was I had different picture

1971
01:26:08,519 --> 01:26:14,070
in my mind about what that adventure

1972
01:26:11,130 --> 01:26:17,010
would be but really that what ended up

1973
01:26:14,069 --> 01:26:21,418
happening was it was a fishing boat that

1974
01:26:17,010 --> 01:26:23,880
had like probably 15 people and the

1975
01:26:21,418 --> 01:26:27,389
whole time it was like a 24-hour fishing

1976
01:26:23,880 --> 01:26:29,069
day and night and like you pay to go to

1977
01:26:27,389 --> 01:26:32,069
this fishing trip but yet we were

1978
01:26:29,069 --> 01:26:33,719
catching like you know we're trying to

1979
01:26:32,069 --> 01:26:35,759
catch schools of yellow tails or

1980
01:26:33,719 --> 01:26:38,550
groupers or snapper we're trying to find

1981
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:41,010
all these things but we weren't really

1982
01:26:38,550 --> 01:26:43,199
fishing to keep the fish the next thing

1983
01:26:41,010 --> 01:26:44,969
I know I was like about day two I tried

1984
01:26:43,198 --> 01:26:46,799
to lose it man I'm really tired I was

1985
01:26:44,969 --> 01:26:49,739
like weird where do people sleep and you

1986
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:53,279
go downstairs like downstairs okay so I

1987
01:26:49,738 --> 01:26:55,078
go downstairs which is like cots right

1988
01:26:53,279 --> 01:26:56,788
that are stacked there's like a cot and

1989
01:26:55,078 --> 01:26:59,069
then a cot and then it caught and

1990
01:26:56,788 --> 01:27:00,509
literally I remember trying to get sleep

1991
01:26:59,069 --> 01:27:02,219
and I was laying in one of these cots

1992
01:27:00,510 --> 01:27:05,820
and there was another human being like

1993
01:27:02,219 --> 01:27:07,618
right above me in their cot and so I was

1994
01:27:05,819 --> 01:27:09,719
like if they pass gas or they make a

1995
01:27:07,618 --> 01:27:11,938
sound or they do anything it's within a

1996
01:27:09,719 --> 01:27:13,229
couple inches of your body like very

1997
01:27:11,939 --> 01:27:16,289
sleep in there so I was like trying to

1998
01:27:13,229 --> 01:27:18,090
sleep there for a while and I was and I

1999
01:27:16,288 --> 01:27:20,759
couldn't sleep there's like three people

2000
01:27:18,090 --> 01:27:23,849
snoring it was like human body right on

2001
01:27:20,760 --> 01:27:25,260
top of you and I went out to the deck I

2002
01:27:23,849 --> 01:27:28,469
tried to sleep on the deck when there's

2003
01:27:25,260 --> 01:27:30,300
a big moon and I got this great idea

2004
01:27:28,469 --> 01:27:32,429
that I'm just gonna take one of the

2005
01:27:30,300 --> 01:27:34,320
pieces of like this Barracuda that we

2006
01:27:32,429 --> 01:27:36,840
caught with a giant hook with a giant

2007
01:27:34,319 --> 01:27:40,759
metal leader and just like go deep-sea

2008
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:43,559
and try to catch a shark so I spent like

2009
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:46,380
like 30 minutes rigging this thing up

2010
01:27:43,559 --> 01:27:48,739
giant piece of bait like just huge like

2011
01:27:46,380 --> 01:27:50,750
off of a 3-footer than just

2012
01:27:48,739 --> 01:27:53,569
like wrapped around this hook and

2013
01:27:50,750 --> 01:27:56,510
dropped it and weighed it and I must

2014
01:27:53,569 --> 01:27:57,829
have waited like I don't know like an

2015
01:27:56,510 --> 01:27:59,270
hour and a half - where you get like

2016
01:27:57,829 --> 01:28:02,180
delusional what do you think the like

2017
01:27:59,270 --> 01:28:03,980
rod is actually moving when it's not you

2018
01:28:02,180 --> 01:28:07,700
know you're I think I might got a hit I

2019
01:28:03,979 --> 01:28:09,169
might have a hit and I think one of my

2020
01:28:07,699 --> 01:28:10,279
brothers like you don't have a head come

2021
01:28:09,170 --> 01:28:12,289
on man it's like 3:00 in the morning

2022
01:28:10,279 --> 01:28:14,840
signal it's like moving kind of weird

2023
01:28:12,289 --> 01:28:16,189
he's like all you probably hit bottom or

2024
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:18,800
something there's no way we have

2025
01:28:16,189 --> 01:28:20,539
bottomed out here I don't know it is

2026
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:23,150
like this it's weird so the pole just

2027
01:28:20,539 --> 01:28:28,220
started to move like you know just like

2028
01:28:23,149 --> 01:28:31,279
moving like this and about an hour and

2029
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:32,720
45 minutes online I'm sitting there

2030
01:28:31,279 --> 01:28:35,359
struggling with it struggling way that

2031
01:28:32,720 --> 01:28:37,699
my arms are [ __ ] dead I've passed

2032
01:28:35,359 --> 01:28:39,979
this pulled two brothers the captain

2033
01:28:37,699 --> 01:28:41,479
different people like break it up break

2034
01:28:39,979 --> 01:28:43,099
it up let's see what it is and I'm

2035
01:28:41,479 --> 01:28:46,879
pulling all the way up and I was like I

2036
01:28:43,100 --> 01:28:50,030
was like a giant huge like 11 foot nurse

2037
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:52,550
shark and like as soon as the captain

2038
01:28:50,029 --> 01:28:54,769
saw it took the knife out and cut the

2039
01:28:52,550 --> 01:28:58,940
thing and he's like it's like we're done

2040
01:28:54,770 --> 01:29:00,260
here boom just cut that I was like and I

2041
01:28:58,939 --> 01:29:02,299
remember I was like what are you doing

2042
01:29:00,260 --> 01:29:04,310
he's like it's a nurse shark we're not

2043
01:29:02,300 --> 01:29:06,739
catching on out here for nurse shark and

2044
01:29:04,310 --> 01:29:09,080
he just cut it and let it go it was like

2045
01:29:06,739 --> 01:29:11,599
one of my fishing stories there's a huge

2046
01:29:09,079 --> 01:29:14,659
inner shark it's pretty ridiculous the

2047
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:18,530
ikana shark a nurse Jean a nurse shark

2048
01:29:14,659 --> 01:29:21,170
bottom P excellent story - I must say

2049
01:29:18,529 --> 01:29:27,679
good fish story to be jumping right on

2050
01:29:21,170 --> 01:29:34,730
Church and we went from a 50 pound

2051
01:29:27,680 --> 01:29:36,530
salmon to an 11-foot but you know like

2052
01:29:34,729 --> 01:29:39,199
the letdown it was a three-hour ordeal

2053
01:29:36,529 --> 01:29:40,939
so like when the left from the concept

2054
01:29:39,199 --> 01:29:43,389
to getting a fish but like when that guy

2055
01:29:40,939 --> 01:29:47,359
took out that knife and without even

2056
01:29:43,390 --> 01:29:49,250
hesitation just cut it he just cut the

2057
01:29:47,359 --> 01:29:50,269
line he's like you're done here he's

2058
01:29:49,250 --> 01:29:53,180
like what are you doing trying to catch

2059
01:29:50,270 --> 01:29:55,520
a nurse shark like it was like he was

2060
01:29:53,180 --> 01:29:57,140
just he was like we're done you know it

2061
01:29:55,520 --> 01:30:00,050
was like that the excitement was gone

2062
01:29:57,140 --> 01:30:01,640
man like in a second I didn't understand

2063
01:30:00,050 --> 01:30:03,038
it as a kid look what do you mean we

2064
01:30:01,640 --> 01:30:06,280
could eat it he's like

2065
01:30:03,038 --> 01:30:09,469
we're not bringing that into the boat

2066
01:30:06,279 --> 01:30:11,509
but yeah at the end it was like I kind

2067
01:30:09,469 --> 01:30:13,760
of like realized what was going on as a

2068
01:30:11,510 --> 01:30:15,349
commercial fishing boat so I said what

2069
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:17,059
about all these fish that we caught he's

2070
01:30:15,349 --> 01:30:18,409
like yeah you paid you know if you

2071
01:30:17,059 --> 01:30:21,439
caught a certain amount of fish you paid

2072
01:30:18,408 --> 01:30:23,029
your way so he's gonna refund the four

2073
01:30:21,439 --> 01:30:24,409
or five hundred bucks and I was like man

2074
01:30:23,029 --> 01:30:26,809
we've been catching fish for three days

2075
01:30:24,408 --> 01:30:28,819
here we got thousands of pounds of

2076
01:30:26,809 --> 01:30:30,889
commercial grade fish for restaurants

2077
01:30:28,819 --> 01:30:32,688

01:31:28,130 --> 01:31:31,788
telling you there was like live coolers

2105
01:31:29,988 --> 01:31:34,089
didn't like it was a pretty big

2106
01:31:31,788 --> 01:31:45,708
commercial boat and all we did was fish

2107
01:31:34,090 --> 01:31:48,319
24 hours day and night like late 90 so

2108
01:31:45,708 --> 01:31:57,198
you know things were touched by the

2109
01:31:48,319 --> 01:32:02,688
sounds well I got some nice sleep today

2110
01:31:57,198 --> 01:32:05,299
though yeah yeah I needed it I slept

2111
01:32:02,689 --> 01:32:06,800
yesterday and today I have a toddler so

2112
01:32:05,300 --> 01:32:10,070
I just don't sleep at all

2113
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:15,159
that's horrible ah you get over it after

2114
01:32:10,069 --> 01:32:15,158
like year to year too

2115
01:32:18,819 --> 01:32:25,609
get used to operating in this like

2116
01:32:21,229 --> 01:32:31,819
extreme sleep deprivation state where

2117
01:32:25,609 --> 01:32:34,179
you just make it happen make it work we

2118
01:32:31,819 --> 01:32:37,670
need a run in need to run into at thien

2119
01:32:34,180 --> 01:32:43,220
next week he was at a game I've got a

2120
01:32:37,670 --> 01:32:46,520
little present for ya I can always pop

2121
01:32:43,220 --> 01:32:48,890
over to yep that's the way to do it

2122
01:32:46,520 --> 01:32:53,000
right girlie

2123
01:32:48,890 --> 01:32:54,560
the strawberry banana goo full melt it's

2124
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:56,479
really interesting I'm waiting for these

2125
01:32:54,560 --> 01:33:00,200
terpene reports to see the difference

2126
01:32:56,479 --> 01:33:03,709
between full melt a hash rosin and a

2127
01:33:00,199 --> 01:33:05,630
flower rosin and the flower this should

2128
01:33:03,710 --> 01:33:08,449
be interesting because this they all

2129
01:33:05,630 --> 01:33:10,279
uniquely smell different but I do you

2130
01:33:08,449 --> 01:33:13,670
think I do you think I like the smell of

2131
01:33:10,279 --> 01:33:16,609
the full mount better to expel more

2132
01:33:13,670 --> 01:33:18,710
strawberry or more banana this full Mel

2133
01:33:16,609 --> 01:33:25,210
smells more strawberry mmm

2134
01:33:18,710 --> 01:33:27,859
but the I would say the the hash rosin I

2135
01:33:25,210 --> 01:33:29,539
have that someone to see the hash with

2136
01:33:27,859 --> 01:33:34,279
the banana come out in the flavor then

2137
01:33:29,539 --> 01:33:37,130
and that when you hit it the hash frozen

2138
01:33:34,279 --> 01:33:38,899
has a good balance of the two if I smoke

2139
01:33:37,130 --> 01:33:41,239
through all that hash dropping I think I

2140
01:33:38,899 --> 01:33:44,299
did that tells you what's better that's

2141
01:33:41,239 --> 01:33:46,519
exactly what tells you that's the

2142
01:33:44,300 --> 01:33:48,230
ultimate like test right there like what

2143
01:33:46,520 --> 01:33:50,570
God smoked first like I don't give a

2144
01:33:48,229 --> 01:33:53,599
[ __ ] what I don't want numbers and what

2145
01:33:50,569 --> 01:33:55,759
you think of the effects and then the

2146
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:57,320
blah blah blah put it on the table put a

2147
01:33:55,760 --> 01:33:59,420
bunch of heads in the room and tell me

2148
01:33:57,319 --> 01:34:03,199
which one's gone first that is for sure

2149
01:33:59,420 --> 01:34:05,409
the best yeah it's one Thomas how's the

2150
01:34:03,199 --> 01:34:08,359
Hat frozen gone that's crazy

2151
01:34:05,409 --> 01:34:12,590
how's the hash rosin gone no Tony you're

2152
01:34:08,359 --> 01:34:16,399
a fiend Wow it's gone

2153
01:34:12,590 --> 01:34:22,250
well it was sitting on the table the

2154
01:34:16,399 --> 01:34:25,639
longest oh yeah but yeah you're right

2155
01:34:22,250 --> 01:34:27,359
because the it's hard to tell it's like

2156
01:34:25,640 --> 01:34:29,699
and also the hashes

2157
01:34:27,359 --> 01:34:33,960
like full melts a little more subtle you

2158
01:34:29,698 --> 01:34:36,299
know I just let this thing melt and it

2159
01:34:33,960 --> 01:34:38,130
is more strawberry for sure we'll find

2160
01:34:36,300 --> 01:34:40,110
out though because it looks like Monday

2161
01:34:38,130 --> 01:34:41,909
I'll have all the turkey test back it's

2162
01:34:40,109 --> 01:34:46,319
weird the terpene test is the last thing

2163
01:34:41,908 --> 01:34:48,000
usually the pesticides right well it's

2164
01:34:46,319 --> 01:34:54,479
always good to get the pesticide free

2165
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:56,698
one in yeah be like right on well you

2166
01:34:54,479 --> 01:34:58,678
know that's like your when we were

2167
01:34:56,698 --> 01:35:00,269
talking about resin profiles nowadays

2168
01:34:58,679 --> 01:35:02,908
especially in California and I think

2169
01:35:00,270 --> 01:35:05,310
it'll be a trend everywhere especially

2170
01:35:02,908 --> 01:35:07,289
when you're smoking something is to the

2171
01:35:05,310 --> 01:35:09,929
parts of rebellion and pesticides for

2172
01:35:07,289 --> 01:35:15,510
concentrates and flowers goes back to

2173
01:35:09,929 --> 01:35:16,739
the farmer so you know people a lot of

2174
01:35:15,510 --> 01:35:20,639
people say oh yeah I don't use

2175
01:35:16,738 --> 01:35:21,689
pesticides and then they fail it you

2176
01:35:20,639 --> 01:35:23,130
know based on where they're getting

2177
01:35:21,689 --> 01:35:26,039
their clones from and things like that

2178
01:35:23,130 --> 01:35:31,199
so or that they're liars or they're

2179
01:35:26,039 --> 01:35:33,359
liars a little bit of both yeah you know

2180
01:35:31,198 --> 01:35:34,829
I think that like some of these people

2181
01:35:33,359 --> 01:35:36,630
just oh they're not lying though they're

2182
01:35:34,829 --> 01:35:39,569
just like growing outdoors or trying to

2183
01:35:36,630 --> 01:35:41,789
as they can and they get like maybe a

2184
01:35:39,569 --> 01:35:43,859
tainted clone they don't know it the

2185
01:35:41,789 --> 01:35:47,429
flowers don't test positive or there's a

2186
01:35:43,859 --> 01:35:49,408
nearby field or they're like you know

2187
01:35:47,429 --> 01:35:52,980
other farms that aren't cannabis or

2188
01:35:49,408 --> 01:35:54,269
spraying really devastates you know if

2189
01:35:52,979 --> 01:35:55,500
you're not lying and you're trying to do

2190
01:35:54,270 --> 01:35:57,420
the right thing and you get that it

2191
01:35:55,500 --> 01:35:59,988
really like it just devastates people

2192
01:35:57,420 --> 01:36:03,600
and their and their hard work you know I

2193
01:35:59,988 --> 01:36:06,718
think you had an episode with Brian from

2194
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:09,960
vital on talking about clone

2195
01:36:06,719 --> 01:36:12,000
certification we did yep yeah that's

2196
01:36:09,960 --> 01:36:15,448
gonna be the next that's like the next

2197
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:18,118
move for sure I invited him in today but

2198
01:36:15,448 --> 01:36:20,609
he I'm not sure it was last minute I

2199
01:36:18,118 --> 01:36:22,229
didn't give anyone any I didn't plan the

2200
01:36:20,609 --> 01:36:24,479
show today I was just like just do a

2201
01:36:22,229 --> 01:36:27,329
show it's 152 episodes were four

2202
01:36:24,479 --> 01:36:32,849
episodes away from three years are you

2203
01:36:27,329 --> 01:36:35,639
kidding me well no three years it's

2204
01:36:32,850 --> 01:36:37,910
pretty ridiculous actually it is

2205
01:36:35,639 --> 01:36:40,279
ridiculous

2206
01:36:37,909 --> 01:36:42,590
DAB's up I see you have the fat end of

2207
01:36:40,279 --> 01:36:47,059
the scoop yeah

2208
01:36:42,590 --> 01:36:51,260
bone rep mother lovers let's do this oh

2209
01:36:47,060 --> 01:36:55,370
this is the last this is a bog rat

2210
01:36:51,260 --> 01:36:58,880
mother lovers mmm pen I like the pen

2211
01:36:55,369 --> 01:37:01,699
while hitting the the dab rig as well I

2212
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:04,699
find that it gives me a super Spacey

2213
01:37:01,699 --> 01:37:06,319
trippy high okay so now that you've had

2214
01:37:04,699 --> 01:37:08,510
it for like a week it made your own

2215
01:37:06,319 --> 01:37:09,199
stuff you kind of see what I'm talking

2216
01:37:08,510 --> 01:37:12,619
about

2217
01:37:09,199 --> 01:37:14,449
well you don't take a you know really

2218
01:37:12,619 --> 01:37:16,880
taking like this little chirping hits

2219
01:37:14,449 --> 01:37:22,130
before but there is a I feel there's a

2220
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:25,430
completely different experience but

2221
01:37:22,130 --> 01:37:26,680
you've had it for a week what's your

2222
01:37:25,430 --> 01:37:29,270
thoughts on it

2223
01:37:26,680 --> 01:37:31,070
well my unique anomaly that I

2224
01:37:29,270 --> 01:37:35,240
experienced right off the bat was my

2225
01:37:31,069 --> 01:37:36,949
first cartridge I used that where's my

2226
01:37:35,239 --> 01:37:39,920
bike squish did you see that 30 percent

2227
01:37:36,949 --> 01:37:42,199
squish we did [ __ ] videos ridiculous

2228
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:46,159
it's a hundred and thirty grams per

2229
01:37:42,199 --> 01:37:56,630
pound for those that are 136 136 grams

2230
01:37:46,159 --> 01:37:58,099
yeah the cuts on the way anyway gotta

2231
01:37:56,630 --> 01:38:02,180
give that away to some people that's

2232
01:37:58,100 --> 01:38:05,180
important it's what it did was okay I

2233
01:38:02,180 --> 01:38:08,329
put like five point seven drops of

2234
01:38:05,180 --> 01:38:11,840
Clementine into a half gram of this

2235
01:38:08,329 --> 01:38:15,949
rosin then it was like it didn't quite

2236
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:19,520
get half gram or gram Oh a gram yeah

2237
01:38:15,949 --> 01:38:22,340
yeah okay it's 5.7 yeah I just say it

2238
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:24,350
was a grab it was a gram so okay good

2239
01:38:22,340 --> 01:38:26,900
gram which made two cartridges now check

2240
01:38:24,350 --> 01:38:29,750
this out we couldn't taste the

2241
01:38:26,899 --> 01:38:31,759
Clementine and we couldn't Tate I also

2242
01:38:29,750 --> 01:38:33,770
put a drop of sour tangi in there just

2243
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:35,449
for good measure because it was also

2244
01:38:33,770 --> 01:38:36,440
citrusy and beautiful and I had it there

2245
01:38:35,449 --> 01:38:38,329
and I was just like I'm just gonna throw

2246
01:38:36,439 --> 01:38:41,629
a drop of this in to made it real nice

2247
01:38:38,329 --> 01:38:44,510
and oil was just perfect but all it

2248
01:38:41,630 --> 01:38:47,119
tasted like was where is my bike it was

2249
01:38:44,510 --> 01:38:50,060
100% - where is my bike terpene profile

2250
01:38:47,119 --> 01:38:51,000
it's like it took but it was so loud it

2251
01:38:50,060 --> 01:38:53,280
was like so

2252
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:55,310
Oh loud like ten times louder than it

2253
01:38:53,279 --> 01:38:58,050
was so basically instead of getting like

2254
01:38:55,310 --> 01:39:00,120
clementines it assimilated the

2255
01:38:58,050 --> 01:39:02,940
Clementine turned it into its own turf

2256
01:39:00,119 --> 01:39:06,989
profile and that pen hit right to the

2257
01:39:02,939 --> 01:39:21,750
last drop dude perfection so [ __ ]

2258
01:39:06,989 --> 01:39:27,389
good almost died but yeah the that's why

2259
01:39:21,750 --> 01:39:28,770
I say the last video I'm gonna make for

2260
01:39:27,390 --> 01:39:32,369
those that are I know that they're

2261
01:39:28,770 --> 01:39:35,730
selling them already empty but there's

2262
01:39:32,369 --> 01:39:38,909
videos on bubbleman brand YouTube not

2263
01:39:35,729 --> 01:39:41,369
your you not your bubble men's world but

2264
01:39:38,909 --> 01:39:43,319
there's a how to turn it on how to get

2265
01:39:41,369 --> 01:39:45,420
different controlled tabs out of it how

2266
01:39:43,319 --> 01:39:48,449
to fill it how to clean it I can show

2267
01:39:45,420 --> 01:39:49,770
them right now yeah I'll do it I'll show

2268
01:39:48,449 --> 01:39:52,800
a couple of the videos while you're

2269
01:39:49,770 --> 01:39:55,650
talking one thing I would say that I get

2270
01:39:52,800 --> 01:39:57,810
a lot of people that they don't get it

2271
01:39:55,649 --> 01:40:02,699
and you can tell the different tank is

2272
01:39:57,810 --> 01:40:04,950
like that that is the top part or if any

2273
01:40:02,699 --> 01:40:06,989
of like if you put a lie bras or any

2274
01:40:04,949 --> 01:40:09,179
sauces in there and then what it does

2275
01:40:06,989 --> 01:40:12,630
it's so powerful that it warms it up and

2276
01:40:09,180 --> 01:40:17,550
turns it into oil and then that goes

2277
01:40:12,630 --> 01:40:19,199
through four holes so it's just it's

2278
01:40:17,550 --> 01:40:22,320
different you know people got to get

2279
01:40:19,199 --> 01:40:28,889
used to it yeah I'm showing the video of

2280
01:40:22,319 --> 01:40:30,269
you filling in when I first looked at

2281
01:40:28,890 --> 01:40:33,060
these I thought holy [ __ ] these are

2282
01:40:30,270 --> 01:40:34,950
gonna be really hard to fill but when I

2283
01:40:33,060 --> 01:40:37,890
filled the first two I didn't I actually

2284
01:40:34,949 --> 01:40:39,929
spilt one single drop that fell off the

2285
01:40:37,890 --> 01:40:43,740
tip of my syringe and if I ended up

2286
01:40:39,930 --> 01:40:45,329
scooping it up and the one thing with it

2287
01:40:43,739 --> 01:40:47,849
is that if you see how I go in a little

2288
01:40:45,329 --> 01:40:49,800
little around I did the same thing you

2289
01:40:47,850 --> 01:40:52,650
got to do that circular thing and go

2290
01:40:49,800 --> 01:40:54,960
because it doesn't Wow

2291
01:40:52,649 --> 01:40:56,759
it's like I hit the pan and hit my rig

2292
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:58,939
and I'm honestly I think my pen tastes

2293
01:40:56,760 --> 01:40:58,940
better

2294
01:40:59,090 --> 01:41:03,789
yeah well Sam was talking about today he

2295
01:41:02,430 --> 01:41:06,760
was like is there a pen that start

2296
01:41:03,789 --> 01:41:09,220
or a dabber that starts out low and it

2297
01:41:06,760 --> 01:41:10,810
gets warmer and gets warmer and that's

2298
01:41:09,220 --> 01:41:12,789
exactly what we did bro

2299
01:41:10,810 --> 01:41:14,289
yeah talking about it for the lat he's

2300
01:41:12,789 --> 01:41:19,149
definitely been talking about it for the

2301
01:41:14,289 --> 01:41:20,560
last two-plus years yeah well that was

2302
01:41:19,149 --> 01:41:22,329
the thing I figured out cuz you know

2303
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:23,289
it's a new thing and talking with Gary

2304
01:41:22,329 --> 01:41:25,659
I'm like alright what are these

2305
01:41:23,289 --> 01:41:28,149
temperature settings and like if you hit

2306
01:41:25,659 --> 01:41:30,880
it for like 3 to 4 seconds you're

2307
01:41:28,149 --> 01:41:33,879
definitely gonna get a you're definitely

2308
01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:36,670
gonna get like that 550 low temp tab

2309
01:41:33,880 --> 01:41:39,250
yeah but if you hold it to full 12

2310
01:41:36,670 --> 01:41:42,909
you're more like 650 and then if you

2311
01:41:39,250 --> 01:41:46,210
hold it again for another 12 it's like

2312
01:41:42,909 --> 01:41:49,059
over 750 but the way I've been doing it

2313
01:41:46,210 --> 01:41:51,699
is I'll go I'll kind of hit it like for

2314
01:41:49,060 --> 01:41:53,890
3 seconds I let off of it and then I'll

2315
01:41:51,699 --> 01:41:56,729
hit it again for 3 seconds or 5 seconds

2316
01:41:53,890 --> 01:42:00,250
I'll let off of it so I'm kind of like

2317
01:41:56,729 --> 01:42:02,859
controlling like the the dab by the by

2318
01:42:00,250 --> 01:42:07,810
the seconds but honestly a 12 second a

2319
01:42:02,859 --> 01:42:10,899
12 second drip is this really good good

2320
01:42:07,810 --> 01:42:12,580
cloud - yeah clouds out it gives me a

2321
01:42:10,899 --> 01:42:14,710
dab I actually got an anxiety attack

2322
01:42:12,579 --> 01:42:16,090
from awake and baked with this paint pen

2323
01:42:14,710 --> 01:42:19,090
the other day I was like damn that's

2324
01:42:16,090 --> 01:42:23,590
impressive brought me right to the brink

2325
01:42:19,090 --> 01:42:25,510
I was like holy [ __ ] that's a cloud for

2326
01:42:23,590 --> 01:42:31,390
sure what were you hitting bubble man

2327
01:42:25,510 --> 01:42:33,010
that was the where is my bike it was the

2328
01:42:31,390 --> 01:42:37,350
where is my bike right now I have this

2329
01:42:33,010 --> 01:42:39,730
is lemon tree with headbanger cush and

2330
01:42:37,350 --> 01:42:41,610
it's all lemon tree there's no

2331
01:42:39,729 --> 01:42:45,459
headbanger curse profile whatsoever

2332
01:42:41,609 --> 01:42:48,899
where is my bike was it named by

2333
01:42:45,460 --> 01:42:52,180
Hoffman when he took his first trip I

2334
01:42:48,899 --> 01:42:54,849
think it was named by karma genetics

2335
01:42:52,180 --> 01:42:57,270
when he lost his bike after smoking it

2336
01:42:54,850 --> 01:42:57,270
in Amsterdam

2337
01:42:58,729 --> 01:43:06,919
I could be wrong it might be two people

2338
01:43:04,789 --> 01:43:09,590
no he lives in Amsterdam it's the story

2339
01:43:06,920 --> 01:43:12,770
I assumed I'll ask him maybe we'll have

2340
01:43:09,590 --> 01:43:14,569
karma on on hash search in the near

2341
01:43:12,770 --> 01:43:15,440
future maybe I'll invite him right

2342
01:43:14,569 --> 01:43:19,880
[ __ ] now

2343
01:43:15,439 --> 01:43:21,769
oh one thing I was gonna say aw so if

2344
01:43:19,880 --> 01:43:26,480
you have and it's so hard I kept telling

2345
01:43:21,770 --> 01:43:28,460
you pull press pull the console one pull

2346
01:43:26,479 --> 01:43:30,079
air through it and I'm only saying this

2347
01:43:28,460 --> 01:43:32,000
because I know Gary started selling

2348
01:43:30,079 --> 01:43:35,269
these things and I was trying to explain

2349
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:39,409
the oil content you don't mess eh you

2350
01:43:35,270 --> 01:43:41,120
don't necessarily have to do do it with

2351
01:43:39,409 --> 01:43:42,769
turf means the terpenes and then there's

2352
01:43:41,119 --> 01:43:44,479
other questions online the terpenes

2353
01:43:42,770 --> 01:43:47,690
aren't diluted with anything there's

2354
01:43:44,479 --> 01:43:51,559
nothing to dilute them with they are the

2355
01:43:47,689 --> 01:43:55,309
dilution for the Ross yeah that was a

2356
01:43:51,560 --> 01:43:57,830
weird one but the one thing I was gonna

2357
01:43:55,310 --> 01:44:05,000
say is you could do like if you look at

2358
01:43:57,829 --> 01:44:13,340
how to clean the tanks and now he's

2359
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:14,779
watching what's up yeah so so the main

2360
01:44:13,340 --> 01:44:16,970
thing like that I noticed with this

2361
01:44:14,779 --> 01:44:18,529
keeping this thing clean like you can

2362
01:44:16,970 --> 01:44:19,970
always clean it with a q-tip if there's

2363
01:44:18,529 --> 01:44:22,429
ever a little oil but this has a hole

2364
01:44:19,970 --> 01:44:24,590
that goes all the way through the goes

2365
01:44:22,430 --> 01:44:26,780
all the way through the tank which is on

2366
01:44:24,590 --> 01:44:29,779
you could see it right there it's

2367
01:44:26,779 --> 01:44:32,029
different than other ones so if you're

2368
01:44:29,779 --> 01:44:34,039
if you just can I see a lot of people do

2369
01:44:32,029 --> 01:44:35,719
this you know I've been trying to get

2370
01:44:34,039 --> 01:44:37,909
them not to if you hit this button and

2371
01:44:35,720 --> 01:44:40,460
you just hold this button before you hit

2372
01:44:37,909 --> 01:44:42,380
it you're just you're hitting it wrong

2373
01:44:40,460 --> 01:44:44,239
everyone's like oh let me just more let

2374
01:44:42,380 --> 01:44:47,380
me just crush this button this is a very

2375
01:44:44,238 --> 01:44:50,000
powerful battery get the pole press pull

2376
01:44:47,380 --> 01:44:52,159
and then I was gonna say you could if

2377
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:54,800
you didn't have terpenes at home you

2378
01:44:52,159 --> 01:44:57,050
could take your rosin like flower oz and

2379
01:44:54,800 --> 01:45:00,050
you could take things in it it's not

2380
01:44:57,050 --> 01:45:01,850
something I like I would do but it I've

2381
01:45:00,050 --> 01:45:05,390
done it just to try to see if I could do

2382
01:45:01,850 --> 01:45:09,620
it which was you could gently take your

2383
01:45:05,390 --> 01:45:12,289
rosin in a in a bowl and gently double

2384
01:45:09,619 --> 01:45:16,849
boil it put it in a water bath

2385
01:45:12,288 --> 01:45:19,309
and and that will slowly go from a th da

2386
01:45:16,849 --> 01:45:20,510
and you're gonna slowly do carpet when

2387
01:45:19,309 --> 01:45:22,338
you're doing it this way we're really

2388
01:45:20,510 --> 01:45:24,469
low temps I'm talking in a bowl that's

2389
01:45:22,338 --> 01:45:26,118
like you know a glass one of these

2390
01:45:24,469 --> 01:45:28,189
things just like we show on the how to

2391
01:45:26,118 --> 01:45:30,818
clean the video and we put it inside

2392
01:45:28,189 --> 01:45:34,338
another one you could put that inside a

2393
01:45:30,819 --> 01:45:37,760
little pot of water and get it down to

2394
01:45:34,338 --> 01:45:39,889
in the you know hundred and 110 degree

2395
01:45:37,760 --> 01:45:40,548
one hundred and five hundred and twenty

2396
01:45:39,889 --> 01:45:42,139
degree

2397
01:45:40,548 --> 01:45:43,788
you'd have to play with it based on your

2398
01:45:42,139 --> 01:45:45,949
elevation and where you're living but

2399
01:45:43,788 --> 01:45:48,618
you could gently warm your flour rosin

2400
01:45:45,948 --> 01:45:50,719
and if you warm it up it'll melt down a

2401
01:45:48,618 --> 01:45:53,238
little bit you could whip it it'll turn

2402
01:45:50,719 --> 01:45:55,849
into a much more kind of the viscosity

2403
01:45:53,238 --> 01:45:59,268
is gonna change and while it's warm you

2404
01:45:55,849 --> 01:46:01,819
could suck it up with a glass or inch so

2405
01:45:59,269 --> 01:46:05,179
you don't necessarily need terpenes in

2406
01:46:01,819 --> 01:46:07,729
my opinion to necessarily get it to get

2407
01:46:05,179 --> 01:46:09,378
it to work in here I've actually put put

2408
01:46:07,729 --> 01:46:14,619
that in here it's it's more of a terpene

2409
01:46:09,378 --> 01:46:17,719
content if something is like 7% 5% 10%

2410
01:46:14,618 --> 01:46:19,728
terpene content it'll work you follow

2411
01:46:17,719 --> 01:46:21,229
what I'm saying bubbleman it doesn't

2412
01:46:19,729 --> 01:46:23,838
actually have to have terpenes this

2413
01:46:21,229 --> 01:46:27,289
thing is powerful this will if you can

2414
01:46:23,838 --> 01:46:28,849
get your oil in here it will work it

2415
01:46:27,288 --> 01:46:31,279
works for distillate to distillate

2416
01:46:28,849 --> 01:46:33,048
actually a distillate with terpenes

2417
01:46:31,279 --> 01:46:36,018
actually tastes really good or live

2418
01:46:33,048 --> 01:46:37,609
rosin or live resin like a live resin

2419
01:46:36,019 --> 01:46:42,168
with a little bit of terpenes I've tried

2420
01:46:37,609 --> 01:46:44,389
it with a lot of different things but

2421
01:46:42,168 --> 01:46:46,068
ultimately you know what we're trying to

2422
01:46:44,389 --> 01:46:47,809
do is do everything without heat so

2423
01:46:46,069 --> 01:46:57,679
we're trying to preserve everything we

2424
01:46:47,809 --> 01:46:59,510
can but that's a way to do it if you

2425
01:46:57,679 --> 01:47:01,158
have hash rosin or flour azam gently

2426
01:46:59,510 --> 01:47:03,128
warm enough to get it warm to get it in

2427
01:47:01,158 --> 01:47:05,688
the vial then to get it into your tank

2428
01:47:03,128 --> 01:47:11,599
so I'm gonna do a couple of videos of

2429
01:47:05,689 --> 01:47:14,359
that too for some chirp sugar well yeah

2430
01:47:11,599 --> 01:47:16,849
Etsy and come by if you can man I've got

2431
01:47:14,359 --> 01:47:22,809
I'll have a little I'll have a little

2432
01:47:16,849 --> 01:47:22,809
basket for you and Steve sweet yeah

2433
01:47:23,279 --> 01:47:33,118
Jack Frost herb sugar such a shot of

2434
01:47:31,229 --> 01:47:35,760
goodness in like you can't even really

2435
01:47:33,118 --> 01:47:40,618
explain it how nice that tastes well

2436
01:47:35,760 --> 01:47:44,760
super sweet full-blown terpene profile

2437
01:47:40,618 --> 01:47:47,578
in the fall like what the [ __ ] dude it's

2438

2439
01:47:47,578 --> 01:47:55,679
it's like but it's Jack Frost sugar then

2440
01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:57,300
long after the sugar is gone after

2441
01:47:55,679 --> 01:48:00,868
you've picked the last piece out of your

2442
01:47:57,300 --> 01:48:02,849

couldn't believe nothing was in there

2464

yeah they said they came in and they're

2465
01:49:17,890 --> 01:49:21,700
like no it's not here I was like well

2466
01:49:20,050 --> 01:49:24,310
could be oh when I open this freezer

2467
01:49:21,699 --> 01:49:25,809
like what's in this freezer I was like

2468
01:49:24,310 --> 01:49:28,600
oh files of terpenes

2469
01:49:25,810 --> 01:49:30,580
they're like house of terpenes okay you

2470
01:49:28,600 --> 01:49:33,280
know plant essence and things like that

2471
01:49:30,579 --> 01:49:35,170
it's like perfumes in essence you know

2472
01:49:33,279 --> 01:49:38,289
we'll open up the freezer and I did it

2473
01:49:35,170 --> 01:49:43,510
was a wolf oh that must be what it is

2474
01:49:38,289 --> 01:49:46,359
and like yeah could be could be that's

2475
01:49:43,510 --> 01:49:48,310
why it's kept in a freezer yeah but no I

2476
01:49:46,359 --> 01:49:51,699
have that rabid air there was a guy on

2477
01:49:48,310 --> 01:49:54,520
past church that messaged me didn't like

2478
01:49:51,699 --> 01:49:57,399
January this rabbit air filter for the

2479
01:49:54,520 --> 01:50:00,490
home has been great and then I'm using a

2480
01:49:57,399 --> 01:50:04,089
I'm in a different location but I'm

2481
01:50:00,489 --> 01:50:06,300
using a pure air it's a little I'll show

2482
01:50:04,090 --> 01:50:11,920
you this other device this does like

2483
01:50:06,300 --> 01:50:14,350
this just like by bipolar ionization so

2484
01:50:11,920 --> 01:50:17,800
it's positive and negative it does like

2485
01:50:14,350 --> 01:50:21,280
I don't know we've been using them in

2486
01:50:17,800 --> 01:50:24,279
the lab facility so pure air they do

2487
01:50:21,279 --> 01:50:28,019
like up to 3,000 square feet and they're

2488
01:50:24,279 --> 01:50:34,119
you kill all dust microbes pathogens

2489
01:50:28,020 --> 01:50:39,130
bacterias molds it's like really good

2490
01:50:34,119 --> 01:50:43,779
air purification and odor so I'll show

2491
01:50:39,130 --> 01:50:46,840
you this little one I think that's what

2492
01:50:43,779 --> 01:50:51,340
the terpenes in the forest do I love

2493
01:50:46,840 --> 01:50:52,949
living in a forest this sort of anti

2494
01:50:51,340 --> 01:50:55,590
septic

2495
01:50:52,948 --> 01:50:57,710
you know just Terps flowingly hair all

2496
01:50:55,590 --> 01:51:01,050
around us

2497
01:50:57,710 --> 01:51:18,420
cedar Terps and douglas-fir turks and

2498
01:51:01,050 --> 01:51:21,840
maple Terps puff on the rig puffing

2499
01:51:18,420 --> 01:51:23,159
today apparently this little thing I

2500
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:26,489
mean pretty solid on the pop this

2501
01:51:23,159 --> 01:51:32,488
company this company a lot it's called

2502
01:51:26,488 --> 01:51:37,709
green tech your hair oh yeah

2503
01:51:32,488 --> 01:51:40,159
that's little bad boy small super small

2504
01:51:37,710 --> 01:51:42,480
it's got a little filter on the back

2505
01:51:40,159 --> 01:51:46,109
said an ionizer what is it

2506
01:51:42,479 --> 01:51:52,109
so it does positive and negative well I

2507
01:51:46,109 --> 01:52:03,420
got to get the thing I'm tell you it's

2508
01:51:52,109 --> 01:52:06,988
the ionizer buh-buh-buh-buh grip let's

2509
01:52:03,420 --> 01:52:12,929
do this once again I've been bombed in

2510
01:52:06,988 --> 01:52:18,899
the whole time we're holding it down are

2511
01:52:12,929 --> 01:52:21,719
we doing yep I mean we use quest but

2512
01:52:18,899 --> 01:52:23,369
this is also this is for the air quality

2513
01:52:21,719 --> 01:52:26,039
this is supposed to like you know you

2514
01:52:23,369 --> 01:52:29,869
won't get sick less people getting sick

2515
01:52:26,039 --> 01:52:29,869
at work - let's see what it says here

2516
01:52:36,829 --> 01:52:42,179
clean the filter that's it here of

2517
01:52:40,738 --> 01:52:45,259
course this doesn't have the selling

2518
01:52:42,179 --> 01:52:45,260
pictures all in the box

2519
01:52:45,469 --> 01:52:53,670
okay uses filtrations bipolar ionization

2520
01:52:49,170 --> 01:52:55,829
ozone removes some of the toughest odors

2521
01:52:53,670 --> 01:53:00,210
and contaminations for nose we clean and

2522
01:52:55,829 --> 01:53:02,760
fresher space the ionizer creates the

2523
01:53:00,210 --> 01:53:05,939
ozone yeah that's what it looked like to

2524
01:53:02,760 --> 01:53:08,079
me and ionizer yeah it does positive and

2525
01:53:05,939 --> 01:53:10,849
negative

2526
01:53:08,079 --> 01:53:14,029
they're positively negative they're both

2527
01:53:10,850 --> 01:53:17,060
yeah bipolar it says to go either way

2528
01:53:14,029 --> 01:53:19,460
but I mean between the rabbit Aaron that

2529
01:53:17,060 --> 01:53:26,380
it's pretty pretty damn on points no no

2530
01:53:19,460 --> 01:53:31,969
it's schizophrenic no no different

2531
01:53:26,380 --> 01:53:35,300
different neurosis is or worse will help

2532
01:53:31,969 --> 01:53:41,000
cure the bipolar well I gotta tell you

2533
01:53:35,300 --> 01:53:45,110
that was pretty melty that was from the

2534
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:54,979
greenhouse to not even the indoor I love

2535
01:53:45,109 --> 01:53:58,880
greenhouse yeah the home is bad for you

2536
01:53:54,979 --> 01:54:02,329
ozone is bad for you yeah I don't think

2537
01:53:58,880 --> 01:54:07,069
it's super great it depends on how much

2538
01:54:02,329 --> 01:54:08,350
comes out of it but oh three very small

2539
01:54:07,069 --> 01:54:12,139
amount of it

2540
01:54:08,350 --> 01:54:16,940
what lightning goes off in this guy you

2541
01:54:12,139 --> 01:54:20,600
can this guy when lightning goes off in

2542
01:54:16,939 --> 01:54:24,559
the sky in the sky in the sky in the sky

2543
01:54:20,600 --> 01:54:27,739
yes oh cool well the rabbit ear does not

2544
01:54:24,560 --> 01:54:31,880
use ozone the rabbit ear has like seven

2545
01:54:27,738 --> 01:54:37,669
filters that it pulls air through and

2546
01:54:31,880 --> 01:54:40,400
that thing has been unstoppable so I was

2547
01:54:37,670 --> 01:54:42,889
it but that's also like a six or $700

2548
01:54:40,399 --> 01:54:47,059
filter for your house this thing I think

2549
01:54:42,889 --> 01:55:00,560
was like maybe 200 bucks so and gave it

2550
01:54:47,060 --> 01:55:04,190
to me condo huh would like to know how

2551
01:55:00,560 --> 01:55:10,940
much ozone it puts out I would like to

2552
01:55:04,189 --> 01:55:16,189
squish a pound that's pretty ridiculous

2553
01:55:10,939 --> 01:55:17,928
that's ridiculous I know what do you so

2554
01:55:16,189 --> 01:55:20,119
all right so what does it actually taste

2555
01:55:17,929 --> 01:55:22,760
like what terpene is to what was

2556
01:55:20,119 --> 01:55:28,369
dude like terpene alene it's like a haze

2557
01:55:22,760 --> 01:55:30,170
it's like interesting it's nice and land

2558
01:55:28,369 --> 01:55:32,329
alike cuz I almost have to I wish I had

2559
01:55:30,170 --> 01:55:34,699
my my where's my bike right here if the

2560
01:55:32,329 --> 01:55:37,909
Breslin was so beautiful looking like it

2561
01:55:34,699 --> 01:55:40,519
came out golden and when it got like

2562
01:55:37,909 --> 01:55:44,329
combined it kinda was orange II amber

2563
01:55:40,520 --> 01:55:45,950
and it was just everyone there liked it

2564
01:55:44,329 --> 01:55:47,510
the most like it was just we squished a

2565
01:55:45,949 --> 01:55:50,689
bunch of things and everyone was like oh

2566
01:55:47,510 --> 01:55:53,900
look at that one you knew what's the

2567
01:55:50,689 --> 01:55:55,219
genetics of it you check real quick cuz

2568
01:55:53,899 --> 01:55:57,049
I don't want to make a mistake and I

2569
01:55:55,220 --> 01:56:04,900
wish I could just invite karma in right

2570
01:55:57,050 --> 01:56:13,699
now just see real quick here what the

2571
01:56:04,899 --> 01:56:16,639
genetics where is my bike so tell us

2572
01:56:13,699 --> 01:56:20,000
what it is no yes okay the mother is

2573
01:56:16,640 --> 01:56:22,579
Karma's award-winning amnesia cut across

2574
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:24,739
to the biker cush male the biker cush

2575
01:56:22,579 --> 01:56:28,279
has changed the THC profile giving it

2576
01:56:24,739 --> 01:56:33,469
some very high test results and the

2577
01:56:28,279 --> 01:56:36,529
amnesia is the D cut variety mostly

2578
01:56:33,470 --> 01:56:38,300
sativa yield high plant height 170

2579
01:56:36,529 --> 01:56:39,949
centimeters blah blah

2580
01:56:38,300 --> 01:56:42,920
what's a flower time what's the flower

2581
01:56:39,949 --> 01:56:46,449
cycle the flower cycle is nine to eleven

2582
01:56:42,920 --> 01:56:50,060
weeks okay so it's a little longer yeah

2583
01:56:46,449 --> 01:56:53,109
but it's not too long not for 32 song

2584
01:56:50,060 --> 01:56:56,090
not for that kind of your turn

2585
01:56:53,109 --> 01:56:59,029
listen wow if there's listened in a

2586
01:56:56,090 --> 01:57:02,270
perfect world in a perfect world when

2587
01:56:59,029 --> 01:57:04,849
you saw the Rossum sasquatch rose and

2588
01:57:02,270 --> 01:57:07,070
presses you can send these cuts these

2589
01:57:04,850 --> 01:57:08,870
are the cuts that we've been you know we

2590
01:57:07,069 --> 01:57:10,729
have spending cuts to all our people and

2591
01:57:08,869 --> 01:57:12,349
people send us cuts back and we do the

2592
01:57:10,729 --> 01:57:15,439
test and these are the highest yields

2593
01:57:12,350 --> 01:57:18,980
the nicest profiles the other thing yeah

2594
01:57:15,439 --> 01:57:20,689
30% is unique because it's really nice

2595
01:57:18,979 --> 01:57:22,579
it's like a profile that you would

2596
01:57:20,689 --> 01:57:25,069
expect to be on something that didn't

2597
01:57:22,579 --> 01:57:27,979
yield much but didn't produce much it's

2598
01:57:25,069 --> 01:57:30,559
like that plus it has this crazy high

2599
01:57:27,979 --> 01:57:31,669
THC so it's also like not only do you

2600
01:57:30,560 --> 01:57:34,039
get this

2601
01:57:31,670 --> 01:57:40,510
like anxious terpene profile but you get

2602
01:57:34,039 --> 01:57:44,659
this wicked strong THC like I liked it a

2603
01:57:40,510 --> 01:57:46,670
lot mm-hmm well it'd be interesting to

2604
01:57:44,659 --> 01:57:48,619
see that crossing with other things but

2605
01:57:46,670 --> 01:57:50,510
that sounds delicious that sounds like a

2606
01:57:48,619 --> 01:57:55,309
really nice and I know them Nita haze

2607
01:57:50,510 --> 01:57:57,619
it's a really high terpene allene and

2608
01:57:55,310 --> 01:58:01,429
that profile that terpene might just

2609
01:57:57,619 --> 01:58:04,609
come out really my work really well in a

2610
01:58:01,429 --> 01:58:08,000
heat temperature treasure type of thing

2611
01:58:04,609 --> 01:58:10,009
with sash blush you know my I said that

2612
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:12,340
it was amnesia haze and someone was like

2613
01:58:10,010 --> 01:58:15,800
no it's not i'm nita haze it's amnesia

2614
01:58:12,340 --> 01:58:18,170
just amnesia yeah it might be some other

2615
01:58:15,800 --> 01:58:19,850
different cut but I I think it's that I

2616
01:58:18,170 --> 01:58:21,619
thought it was that Musa haze it tasted

2617
01:58:19,850 --> 01:58:23,600
like it for sure but I don't want to

2618
01:58:21,619 --> 01:58:25,010
we're on hashed Church and I don't want

2619
01:58:23,600 --> 01:58:27,829
to give away anything that's the wrong

2620
01:58:25,010 --> 01:58:30,920
so you know maybe karma can come on and

2621
01:58:27,829 --> 01:58:38,960
talk about it but whatever the D cut is

2622
01:58:30,920 --> 01:58:42,319
you know what's that oh no sound like

2623
01:58:38,960 --> 01:58:45,260
somebody said fluorine it did sound like

2624
01:58:42,319 --> 01:58:50,329
someone said is that fluorine no it was

2625
01:58:45,260 --> 01:58:55,010
my WAP she has a big mouth Wow what'd

2626
01:58:50,329 --> 01:58:58,039
she say she she was talking about

2627
01:58:55,010 --> 01:58:59,659
something but she didn't realize she was

2628
01:58:58,039 --> 01:59:02,600
sitting right next to a microphone

2629
01:58:59,659 --> 01:59:09,139
that's awesome we barely heard her okay

2630
01:59:02,600 --> 01:59:11,090
it is oh wait yes if she has anything

2631
01:59:09,140 --> 01:59:15,440
important I'll get her to speak a little

2632
01:59:11,090 --> 01:59:17,270
louder huh okay great yes please please

2633
01:59:15,439 --> 01:59:19,428
let her know that if she has anything

2634
01:59:17,270 --> 01:59:21,350
important to share with us we can use

2635
01:59:19,429 --> 01:59:25,340
all the help we can get sometimes so

2636
01:59:21,350 --> 01:59:28,640
most of the time amnesia is different

2637
01:59:25,340 --> 01:59:30,350
okay so amnesia is like an amnesia oh

2638
01:59:28,640 --> 01:59:32,300
gee or something we'll get Carmen here

2639
01:59:30,350 --> 01:59:35,179
to talk about it either way really

2640
01:59:32,300 --> 01:59:38,119
really nice profile when particularly

2641
01:59:35,179 --> 01:59:41,179
mixed with the Clementine which just

2642
01:59:38,119 --> 01:59:43,550
produced more of it was like putting

2643
01:59:41,179 --> 01:59:44,810
terpenes of the same profile into this

2644
01:59:43,550 --> 01:59:50,390
rosin

2645
01:59:44,810 --> 01:59:53,090
it was ridiculous and what was the

2646
01:59:50,390 --> 01:59:56,930
Ronson maid problem was it from water

2647
01:59:53,090 --> 02:00:02,350
hatch dry sip but yeah it was from a bud

2648
01:59:56,930 --> 02:00:05,659
didn't you see the squish now now I mean

2649
02:00:02,350 --> 02:00:11,329
unless what you just had on a while ago

2650
02:00:05,659 --> 02:00:15,189
was just wish I didn't see it but 30%

2651
02:00:11,329 --> 02:00:19,189
from bud Jesus Christ I mean that's

2652
02:00:15,189 --> 02:00:21,589
that's a religious experience it was I

2653
02:00:19,189 --> 02:00:23,179
was like even my friend Neil who told me

2654
02:00:21,590 --> 02:00:26,810
because it was his body's like I got a

2655
02:00:23,180 --> 02:00:29,180
cultivar that should press out about 30%

2656
02:00:26,810 --> 02:00:31,820
I was like 30% he's like I'm telling you

2657
02:00:29,180 --> 02:00:34,280
I did only a couple grams before but I

2658
02:00:31,819 --> 02:00:36,019
got like 30% and now I have an 8 grand

2659
02:00:34,279 --> 02:00:39,859
buddy I'm like all right well we'll do

2660
02:00:36,020 --> 02:00:42,170
it so it was the first thing I pressed

2661
02:00:39,859 --> 02:00:46,579
on my M once a squash press it was the

2662
02:00:42,170 --> 02:00:48,619
first thing and lo and behold like 29

2663
02:00:46,579 --> 02:00:52,579
points something they're saying like it

2664
02:00:48,619 --> 02:00:55,340
was 8 grams in and 2.35 grams

2665
02:00:52,579 --> 02:00:57,170
out and we didn't even squish the pack a

2666
02:00:55,340 --> 02:01:01,630
second time and there was a little bit

2667
02:00:57,170 --> 02:01:03,760
of oil in it so it was ridiculous

2668
02:01:01,630 --> 02:01:08,119
crushed it

2669
02:01:03,760 --> 02:01:11,570
but like he said the the folks that are

2670
02:01:08,119 --> 02:01:14,869
selling wish they they should include

2671
02:01:11,569 --> 02:01:16,579
the clone with each Swisher for real I'm

2672
02:01:14,869 --> 02:01:18,319
telling you in a perfect world you would

2673
02:01:16,579 --> 02:01:20,239
and the same with bubble bags and dry

2674
02:01:18,319 --> 02:01:23,689
sip screens and all that stuff like

2675
02:01:20,239 --> 02:01:25,939
cultivars that are tried and driven that

2676
02:01:23,689 --> 02:01:30,319
super perform under a particular

2677
02:01:25,939 --> 02:01:33,109
methodology yeah they that knowledge

2678
02:01:30,319 --> 02:01:36,979
should spread around absolutely it's

2679
02:01:33,109 --> 02:01:42,469
100% an imperative piece of the puzzle

2680
02:01:36,979 --> 02:01:44,149
but you know you're in scarcity people

2681
02:01:42,470 --> 02:01:45,409
like to hold their [ __ ] close I'm sure

2682
02:01:44,149 --> 02:01:47,719
now that I've been promoting this

2683
02:01:45,409 --> 02:01:52,609
Karma's bike that the cut will be harder

2684
02:01:47,720 --> 02:01:54,230
to get it's like except for me cuz when

2685
02:01:52,609 --> 02:01:56,989
I get it I'll [ __ ] give it to

2686
02:01:54,229 --> 02:01:58,368
everyone why wouldn't you why wouldn't

2687
02:01:56,989 --> 02:02:00,378
you give that cut to people

2688
02:01:58,368 --> 02:02:02,628
like that could use it but it's like

2689
02:02:00,378 --> 02:02:05,510
people that are like well if you had to

2690
02:02:02,628 --> 02:02:06,288
grow a million plants to find that one

2691
02:02:05,510 --> 02:02:09,110
plant

2692
02:02:06,288 --> 02:02:14,809
I can understand it or particulars to

2693
02:02:09,109 --> 02:02:17,089
find it but if my buddy bought the seeds

2694
02:02:14,809 --> 02:02:19,128
from karma genetics and crafted he was

2695
02:02:17,090 --> 02:02:23,918
like it's just a it's just a seed like

2696
02:02:19,128 --> 02:02:28,149
you can you can get it to no problem

2697
02:02:23,918 --> 02:02:31,010
what why do you think it gives 30% I

2698
02:02:28,149 --> 02:02:33,619
mean I have no idea but I suspect the

2699
02:02:31,010 --> 02:02:35,899
planets lined up when mom and dad got

2700
02:02:33,618 --> 02:02:40,819
together and [ __ ] was just like you know

2701
02:02:35,899 --> 02:02:43,669
when the angels sing like oh I have no

2702
02:02:40,819 --> 02:02:46,308
idea I cannot pretend yeah you would

2703
02:02:43,668 --> 02:02:48,559
have a way better idea why such a it

2704
02:02:46,309 --> 02:02:52,399
would be nice to handle eyes it the Raza

2705
02:02:48,559 --> 02:02:56,958
MC is the super high in terpenes or THC

2706
02:02:52,399 --> 02:02:58,789
or what is the profile yeah it

2707
02:02:56,958 --> 02:03:00,698
absolutely will be getting tested in the

2708
02:02:58,788 --> 02:03:03,618
very near future

2709
02:03:00,698 --> 02:03:07,428
very near future and I suspect it will

2710
02:03:03,618 --> 02:03:10,518
be shared far and wide go check out

2711
02:03:07,429 --> 02:03:13,998
karma genetics if you want yours by the

2712
02:03:10,519 --> 02:03:18,019
way I did want to say that after the

2713
02:03:13,998 --> 02:03:19,118
last hash search we pulled I will share

2714
02:03:18,019 --> 02:03:21,349
it with you I didn't want to actually

2715
02:03:19,118 --> 02:03:23,268
have it today because it would have

2716
02:03:21,349 --> 02:03:29,300
ruined my Sunday but it's a I have a

2717
02:03:23,269 --> 02:03:32,899
blue vial of azulene terpenes that we

2718
02:03:29,300 --> 02:03:37,458
sent out for testing on like Thursday or

2719
02:03:32,899 --> 02:03:42,110
Friday so we've tested out for chirping

2720
02:03:37,458 --> 02:03:46,760
analysis as well as potency but it is it

2721
02:03:42,109 --> 02:03:51,288
smells like a like a like a fuel e

2722
02:03:46,760 --> 02:03:52,628
gasoline like super super absurd like

2723
02:03:51,288 --> 02:03:56,958
gasoline smell

2724
02:03:52,628 --> 02:04:00,219
that's a terpene that came off of came

2725
02:03:56,958 --> 02:04:00,219
out of concentrate

2726
02:04:02,859 --> 02:04:11,988
crazy you don't like it though it's yeah

2727
02:04:06,529 --> 02:04:13,939
oh it's horrible no cuz you know a lot

2728
02:04:11,988 --> 02:04:16,158
of people like look down on let's say

2729
02:04:13,939 --> 02:04:19,969
the process of distillation which I find

2730
02:04:16,158 --> 02:04:22,069
pretty funny because distillation is

2731
02:04:19,969 --> 02:04:25,250
just like a a method is just a

2732
02:04:22,069 --> 02:04:26,448
purification at the very end it doesn't

2733
02:04:25,250 --> 02:04:28,969
mean like you've taken something

2734
02:04:26,448 --> 02:04:30,888
horrible and made it better because it

2735
02:04:28,969 --> 02:04:33,230
only makes it worse under the microscope

2736
02:04:30,889 --> 02:04:35,029
meaning if it starts out tainted it's

2737
02:04:33,229 --> 02:04:37,729
going to get worse and worse especially

2738
02:04:35,029 --> 02:04:40,880
if you on a distillate so it's like you

2739
02:04:37,729 --> 02:04:42,319
can't just pull everything out you can't

2740
02:04:40,880 --> 02:04:43,550
pull pesticides out but if you use

2741
02:04:42,319 --> 02:04:45,920
distillate correctly and you're doing

2742
02:04:43,550 --> 02:04:49,429
whole plant extractions and there's just

2743
02:04:45,920 --> 02:04:50,929
a part of the last process it's just you

2744
02:04:49,429 --> 02:04:55,579
know people are just using like steam

2745
02:04:50,929 --> 02:04:58,460
and vacuum to separate and different

2746
02:04:55,579 --> 02:05:02,510
temperatures to separate out different

2747
02:04:58,460 --> 02:05:04,730
things that would be in the resin to get

2748
02:05:02,510 --> 02:05:06,920
to a purer form so in that process

2749
02:05:04,729 --> 02:05:11,329
terpenes are eliminated fats are

2750
02:05:06,920 --> 02:05:14,210
eliminated different things to get to a

2751
02:05:11,329 --> 02:05:18,819
95 or 94 percent clean distillate

2752
02:05:14,210 --> 02:05:23,389
without any pesticide so in that process

2753
02:05:18,819 --> 02:05:25,009
there was there is there is a terpene

2754
02:05:23,389 --> 02:05:29,630
that can come off of it called as alia

2755
02:05:25,010 --> 02:05:32,900
which is what we were talking about it's

2756
02:05:29,630 --> 02:05:39,650
a blue it's like pretty blue it's like

2757
02:05:32,899 --> 02:05:40,279
the color of the sky blue show it to you

2758
02:05:39,649 --> 02:05:42,469
next week

2759
02:05:40,279 --> 02:05:45,259
it's really raunchy it's disgusting I

2760
02:05:42,469 --> 02:05:49,489
just had an incredible Jack Frost Terp

2761
02:05:45,260 --> 02:05:52,369
burp sure it was yeah you would not want

2762
02:05:49,488 --> 02:05:54,229
to have an azulene burp no I wouldn't

2763
02:05:52,369 --> 02:05:56,210
welcome some cool to the room your mic

2764
02:05:54,229 --> 02:05:58,549
is on mute if you've been trying to talk

2765
02:05:56,210 --> 02:06:00,760
we haven't heard you yet you came in

2766
02:05:58,550 --> 02:06:03,020
when Tony was talking and it was

2767
02:06:00,760 --> 02:06:05,989
reverberating the mic so I had to mute

2768
02:06:03,020 --> 02:06:09,440
it but feel free to unmute it and say

2769
02:06:05,988 --> 02:06:13,158
hello if you are indeed here and can

2770
02:06:09,439 --> 02:06:15,710
hear me what cultivar would you give a

2771
02:06:13,158 --> 02:06:18,319
recommend with bubble bags versus screen

2772
02:06:15,710 --> 02:06:20,630
well you know screams I'd probably go

2773
02:06:18,319 --> 02:06:22,909
for some likes like summer Sam Scouts

2774
02:06:20,630 --> 02:06:25,579
number one or that Sleestak crossed with

2775
02:06:22,909 --> 02:06:27,469
skunk number one or even Sleestak alone

2776
02:06:25,579 --> 02:06:30,199
was that also good Samara was at the

2777
02:06:27,469 --> 02:06:34,730
Sleestak skunk that really rained no

2778
02:06:30,199 --> 02:06:37,519
Sleestak by itself we respect skunk I

2779
02:06:34,729 --> 02:06:40,659
tried combining the two of them in the

2780
02:06:37,520 --> 02:06:47,840
dream but the dream was not fulfilled

2781
02:06:40,659 --> 02:06:49,849
okay well no worries no ways subs in the

2782
02:06:47,840 --> 02:06:53,390

very nice that's awesome

2784
02:06:53,390 --> 02:07:02,630
I just took a 480 temp tab rock in the

2785
02:06:57,199 --> 02:07:04,039
480 for that bubble yeah the subs been

2786
02:07:02,630 --> 02:07:09,409

episodes away from our three year

2806
02:08:10,488 --> 02:08:15,169
anniversary and I got to make a plan for

2807
02:08:12,439 --> 02:08:18,738
that show to be like just absolute

2808
02:08:15,170 --> 02:08:21,420
crusher of a show three years is a big

2809
02:08:18,738 --> 02:08:24,269
milestone you know every Sunday gear

2810
02:08:21,420 --> 02:08:28,020
and up and meet having these little

2811
02:08:24,270 --> 02:08:32,810
events oh you did people don't even have

2812
02:08:28,020 --> 02:08:36,660
emails for three years anymore right

2813
02:08:32,810 --> 02:08:38,730
hey sub did you um there's one of your

2814
02:08:36,659 --> 02:08:41,698
varieties that you've created called

2815
02:08:38,729 --> 02:08:53,988
cheese Quakers that somebody else oh I

2816
02:08:41,698 --> 02:08:56,309
think cheese quake is said by accident

2817
02:08:53,988 --> 02:08:58,049
exactly he's coming back Johnny B just

2818
02:08:56,310 --> 02:09:05,100
bounced out of the room his foot

2819
02:08:58,050 --> 02:09:07,140
unplugged his microphone and camera I

2820
02:09:05,100 --> 02:09:10,500
thought he was in a rally car at first

2821
02:09:07,140 --> 02:09:12,119
and I saw the baby seat I thought it was

2822
02:09:10,500 --> 02:09:14,488
like a razor like one of those little

2823
02:09:12,119 --> 02:09:20,670
mini side-by-side cards he looks kind of

2824
02:09:14,488 --> 02:09:25,169
like in this but yes sub has cheesecake

2825
02:09:20,670 --> 02:09:29,279
she's queen slick mm-hmm quake I just

2826
02:09:25,170 --> 02:09:34,109
got a like a couple pounds of it whole

2827
02:09:29,279 --> 02:09:36,899
plant to Terp for the first time they

2828
02:09:34,109 --> 02:09:39,179
actually extract her beans from it so it

2829
02:09:36,899 --> 02:09:41,099
happen ice is uh it's kind of

2830
02:09:39,179 --> 02:09:44,579
interesting because though I've only

2831
02:09:41,100 --> 02:09:46,380
seen a few subs things but each time

2832
02:09:44,579 --> 02:09:48,600
I've seen it like the Jillybean but each

2833
02:09:46,380 --> 02:09:50,190
time I've seen it there's always like an

2834
02:09:48,600 --> 02:09:53,820
expression of the terpene it's just

2835
02:09:50,189 --> 02:09:55,379
really profound in the plant I don't

2836
02:09:53,819 --> 02:09:59,130
know if something he's always just bred

2837
02:09:55,380 --> 02:10:00,750
for looks for early on in the day he

2838
02:09:59,130 --> 02:10:04,560
just said I'm gonna breathe for terpenes

2839
02:10:00,750 --> 02:10:08,000
but really a strong expression we'll see

2840
02:10:04,560 --> 02:10:10,920
how it comes out the extraction process

2841
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:12,899
there's another one ordering seeds of

2842
02:10:10,920 --> 02:10:15,480
the where is my bike Colin James

2843
02:10:12,899 --> 02:10:22,019
Clifford let us know if you're getting

2844
02:10:15,479 --> 02:10:25,109
those 30% yields even if you [ __ ] up and

2845
02:10:22,020 --> 02:10:27,600
get 2024 okay I was thinking the same

2846
02:10:25,109 --> 02:10:30,089
thing if you [ __ ] up and you only get 24

2847
02:10:27,600 --> 02:10:32,219
percent it's still pretty good anything

2848
02:10:30,090 --> 02:10:35,219
over 20 you're dancing you know that's

2849
02:10:32,219 --> 02:10:37,289
like you're doing good

2850
02:10:35,219 --> 02:10:39,869
dude in my opinion you should be like

2851
02:10:37,289 --> 02:10:43,409
add vases should be producing where is

2852
02:10:39,869 --> 02:10:45,809
my bike clones to supply all of their

2853
02:10:43,409 --> 02:10:47,279
growers and the relationships that they

2854
02:10:45,810 --> 02:10:53,670
it's like hey you should try this one

2855
02:10:47,279 --> 02:10:58,460
just give it a shot yeah anything

2856
02:10:53,670 --> 02:10:58,460
that'll get more than 25 percent wrong

2857
02:10:58,850 --> 02:11:03,110
yeah did out by the rosin press

2858
02:11:01,590 --> 02:11:06,810
companies

2859
02:11:03,109 --> 02:11:11,149
yeah that's your staple let's you can

2860
02:11:06,810 --> 02:11:12,510
make all kinds of medicine from that too

2861
02:11:11,149 --> 02:11:15,869
yeah

2862
02:11:12,510 --> 02:11:17,579
oh no Tony with that what what cleaning

2863
02:11:15,869 --> 02:11:19,349
do you need to do to keep it and

2864
02:11:17,579 --> 02:11:22,469
maintain it currently or that you've

2865
02:11:19,350 --> 02:11:25,260
found that there tips and tricks of the

2866
02:11:22,469 --> 02:11:30,390
trade that your friends of keeping walk

2867
02:11:25,260 --> 02:11:32,400
home the this the new stick all the

2868
02:11:30,390 --> 02:11:36,230
Trinity so there's a video on there how

2869
02:11:32,399 --> 02:11:39,509
to clean it I'll put it up put it up

2870
02:11:36,229 --> 02:11:42,689
this is the best trick and how often are

2871
02:11:39,510 --> 02:11:45,690
you cleaning it every time every time

2872
02:11:42,689 --> 02:11:47,939
you go through your tank so if you go if

2873
02:11:45,689 --> 02:11:51,210
you smoke a whole like it's a it's a

2874
02:11:47,939 --> 02:11:52,948
point eight tank you could put more than

2875
02:11:51,210 --> 02:11:56,730
point five in there if you wanted the

2876
02:11:52,948 --> 02:11:59,009
first round but it's a point eight tank

2877
02:11:56,729 --> 02:12:01,529
and I would say I've smoked so I've I

2878
02:11:59,010 --> 02:12:03,239
filled it up after I went so I filled

2879
02:12:01,529 --> 02:12:05,159
the first tank up I went through it and

2880
02:12:03,238 --> 02:12:06,839
then I filled it up again and went

2881
02:12:05,159 --> 02:12:09,180
through it it's not that I didn't go

2882
02:12:06,840 --> 02:12:11,550
through it I would say if it was on a

2883
02:12:09,180 --> 02:12:15,090
taste rating of a hundred percent being

2884
02:12:11,550 --> 02:12:16,800
clean all the way through you know

2885
02:12:15,090 --> 02:12:19,380
you're in the hundred when it first

2886
02:12:16,800 --> 02:12:22,680
starts to I'd say the sweet spot when

2887
02:12:19,380 --> 02:12:24,449
this tank gets going is like twenty five

2888
02:12:22,680 --> 02:12:26,430
percent of the way through it it starts

2889
02:12:24,448 --> 02:12:27,869
to taste really really good halfway

2890
02:12:26,430 --> 02:12:29,789
through and towards the end it's even

2891
02:12:27,869 --> 02:12:32,609
better and better then if you try to

2892
02:12:29,789 --> 02:12:36,149
reload this again the taste is still

2893
02:12:32,609 --> 02:12:40,948
okay I feel like it probably loses maybe

2894
02:12:36,149 --> 02:12:42,899
five percent in the process and you

2895
02:12:40,948 --> 02:12:45,238
could go through it a second time but I

2896
02:12:42,899 --> 02:12:46,920
feel like that's kind of like wearing

2897
02:12:45,238 --> 02:12:48,539
and tearing it so if you wanted to like

2898
02:12:46,920 --> 02:12:51,210
keep this you know say

2899
02:12:48,539 --> 02:12:54,000
ten times over the best thing in my

2900
02:12:51,210 --> 02:12:56,460
opinion is use it and then clean it and

2901
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:58,949
then fill it and then use it again and

2902
02:12:56,460 --> 02:13:04,279
you know you could get like you know ten

2903
02:12:58,949 --> 02:13:07,710
times ten times out of it you know easy

2904
02:13:04,279 --> 02:13:09,300
but if you push it and you keep and you

2905
02:13:07,710 --> 02:13:11,010
just keep filling it without cleaning it

2906
02:13:09,300 --> 02:13:13,230
I think that's when you're gonna blow

2907
02:13:11,010 --> 02:13:17,940
this thing out I've done it three times

2908
02:13:13,229 --> 02:13:19,289
before but I wouldn't recommend it I

2909
02:13:17,939 --> 02:13:21,089
would just clean it every time it's easy

2910
02:13:19,289 --> 02:13:24,269
to clean it if you could actually if you

2911
02:13:21,090 --> 02:13:26,159
actually just follow the instructions I

2912
02:13:24,270 --> 02:13:30,480
mean it's like take the screw cap off

2913
02:13:26,159 --> 02:13:32,849
drop it in I so 99% wait 24 hours drop

2914
02:13:30,479 --> 02:13:34,919
it in filtered water rinse it again in

2915
02:13:32,850 --> 02:13:37,070
filtered water you can leave it sit

2916
02:13:34,920 --> 02:13:40,529
there for a few hours even in just water

2917
02:13:37,069 --> 02:13:42,899
which tells you this thing's made a

2918
02:13:40,529 --> 02:13:46,079
different differently if you're able to

2919
02:13:42,899 --> 02:13:48,509
just soak it in water but use filtered

2920
02:13:46,079 --> 02:13:51,809
water or Fiji water you know something

2921
02:13:48,510 --> 02:13:54,060
something that's really clean and let it

2922
02:13:51,810 --> 02:13:57,260
air dry and then refill it it doesn't

2923
02:13:54,060 --> 02:13:59,400
really take that much to to clean them

2924
02:13:57,260 --> 02:14:00,720
but you definitely want to have two of

2925
02:13:59,399 --> 02:14:04,819
them so you could have one cleaning

2926
02:14:00,720 --> 02:14:04,820
while the other one is being used

2927
02:14:05,989 --> 02:14:16,380
ya know I played the video while you

2928
02:14:11,430 --> 02:14:19,039
were talking actually so that's so in

2929
02:14:16,380 --> 02:14:21,779
that video there's a hot bath method oh

2930
02:14:19,039 --> 02:14:23,640
yeah yeah yeah so that's the fastest way

2931
02:14:21,779 --> 02:14:25,559
so if you didn't want it like I feel

2932
02:14:23,640 --> 02:14:28,410
like a deep cleaners let it sit in ISO

2933
02:14:25,560 --> 02:14:30,720
24 but if you did the hot bath and went

2934
02:14:28,409 --> 02:14:35,279
like 15 20 minutes it does a pretty damn

2935
02:14:30,720 --> 02:14:38,310
good job like cleaning at all I didn't

2936
02:14:35,279 --> 02:14:40,619
see any problems with it or difference

2937
02:14:38,310 --> 02:14:42,720
but I would say that maybe if he if he

2938
02:14:40,619 --> 02:14:44,579
did the quick hot bath like the first

2939
02:14:42,720 --> 02:14:49,350
five times like maybe your fifth time to

2940
02:14:44,579 --> 02:14:50,880
a deep clean so I mean that's the big

2941
02:14:49,350 --> 02:14:53,280
thing about the tank is that you get to

2942
02:14:50,880 --> 02:14:55,380
reuse it sell them in six-packs

2943
02:14:53,279 --> 02:14:57,609
someone says I like the word quiver

2944
02:14:55,380 --> 02:15:02,079
myself it would be cool to get like a

2945
02:14:57,609 --> 02:15:05,049
stank Oh do like a do like a cream yeah

2946
02:15:02,079 --> 02:15:09,250
live rosin sauce like like six different

2947
02:15:05,050 --> 02:15:12,070
ones yeah okay that's pretty dope get

2948
02:15:09,250 --> 02:15:15,489
like a case yeah exactly that's quiver

2949
02:15:12,069 --> 02:15:27,609
like a quiver case a swimmer will have

2950
02:15:15,489 --> 02:15:31,269
you quivering case Tony do you have big

2951
02:15:27,609 --> 02:15:36,269
hands or is the pen just tiny I kind of

2952
02:15:31,270 --> 02:15:36,270
have big hands but the pen is not tiny I

2953
02:15:36,600 --> 02:15:44,380
don't think so but those hands might

2954
02:15:42,399 --> 02:15:53,469
have been Gary's hands if they're on

2955
02:15:44,380 --> 02:15:55,180
Instagram no when the video I guess I'm

2956
02:15:53,470 --> 02:16:02,350
gonna have big hands I mean can you fit

2957
02:15:55,180 --> 02:16:04,000
your whole pen behind yours the pen yeah

2958
02:16:02,350 --> 02:16:11,650
can you put it all behind your hand just

2959
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:19,060
like this alright I got big hands two

2960
02:16:11,649 --> 02:16:22,329
men yeah I puffed really hard to this

2961
02:16:19,060 --> 02:16:24,640
whole show well mr. Hyde if it seems

2962
02:16:22,329 --> 02:16:27,640
like a waste when you clean it clean it

2963
02:16:24,640 --> 02:16:30,100
out with like ethanol instead of I so

2964
02:16:27,640 --> 02:16:32,579
then you can evaporate the ethanol and

2965
02:16:30,100 --> 02:16:34,930
or whatever that you know the the pure

2966
02:16:32,579 --> 02:16:37,719
alcohol that people use green alcohol

2967
02:16:34,930 --> 02:16:40,270
yep you can do that too you can use

2968
02:16:37,719 --> 02:16:42,760
green alcohol too but it does a really

2969
02:16:40,270 --> 02:16:45,310
good job getting all the oil all the way

2970
02:16:42,760 --> 02:16:46,899
down that's for sure there's a little

2971
02:16:45,309 --> 02:16:49,119
bit there is like if you get like a

2972
02:16:46,899 --> 02:16:51,760
creamy stuff I will admit there is a

2973
02:16:49,120 --> 02:16:54,130
little bit up on the tank but what I've

2974
02:16:51,760 --> 02:16:56,889
done with that is I will warm it up on

2975
02:16:54,129 --> 02:17:00,009
the edge of I know Garrow probably

2976
02:16:56,889 --> 02:17:02,800
madami but I just like leave it just the

2977
02:17:00,010 --> 02:17:06,341
edge of the til it drips down yeah

2978
02:17:02,800 --> 02:17:08,139
exactly so you know just like on the

2979
02:17:06,341 --> 02:17:09,489
Dean I'll just warm it up a little bit

2980
02:17:08,139 --> 02:17:10,949
and it just turns into an oil and it

2981
02:17:09,489 --> 02:17:14,309
drips down

2982
02:17:10,950 --> 02:17:15,690
but that's just if it's cream you know

2983
02:17:14,309 --> 02:17:19,468
like nada we were talking about the

2984
02:17:15,690 --> 02:17:23,880
different resin and not everything's

2985
02:17:19,468 --> 02:17:26,789
gonna turn creamy you know but the

2986
02:17:23,879 --> 02:17:28,199
creamy stuff does that sure it's true

2987
02:17:26,790 --> 02:17:30,650
for those of you wondering what we're

2988
02:17:28,200 --> 02:17:30,650
talkin about

2989
02:17:30,979 --> 02:17:35,729
excuse me

2990
02:17:33,209 --> 02:17:39,839
pull that pen really rips some of the

2991
02:17:35,729 --> 02:17:44,189
olih ills when you put the rosin in with

2992
02:17:39,840 --> 02:17:46,250
the terpenes it just well I have a

2993
02:17:44,190 --> 02:17:50,700
perfect example actually main sort of

2994
02:17:46,250 --> 02:17:55,170
types that you'll get which is a really

2995
02:17:50,700 --> 02:17:57,870
nice kind of cream on the right there on

2996
02:17:55,170 --> 02:18:00,270
the lemon tree it's actually on the left

2997
02:17:57,870 --> 02:18:02,040
its flipped and then on the other side

2998
02:18:00,270 --> 02:18:05,370
the Clementine which is much more of a

2999
02:18:02,040 --> 02:18:08,160
saucy oily you know pull and snap not

3000
02:18:05,370 --> 02:18:11,100
really because it pours but those two

3001
02:18:08,159 --> 02:18:14,430
different roses were very different to

3002
02:18:11,100 --> 02:18:19,890
work with and and Terp sauces i guess i

3003
02:18:14,430 --> 02:18:22,170
should call them Terp oils it's uh the

3004
02:18:19,889 --> 02:18:24,840
thing is is this pen really tony is just

3005
02:18:22,170 --> 02:18:27,149
in time for terpenes going down in price

3006
02:18:24,840 --> 02:18:29,639
cuz trying to fill these up in the

3007
02:18:27,149 --> 02:18:32,430
canadian market at ten dollars a drop or

3008
02:18:29,639 --> 02:18:37,139
whatever is damn near impossible got to

3009
02:18:32,430 --> 02:18:38,819
be able to do do the be able to make the

3010
02:18:37,139 --> 02:18:40,170
terpenes and be able to get them at a

3011
02:18:38,819 --> 02:18:42,479
price where you can put them in these

3012
02:18:40,170 --> 02:18:44,159
pens and it's not you know like four

3013
02:18:42,479 --> 02:18:46,739
hundred dollars per cartridge or

3014
02:18:44,159 --> 02:18:49,319
something so there's a lot of Terps in

3015
02:18:46,739 --> 02:18:52,500
these pens so and then and they are not

3016
02:18:49,319 --> 02:18:54,840
fruit terpenes or someone else's weird

3017
02:18:52,500 --> 02:18:58,290
little recipe but they've come up with

3018
02:18:54,840 --> 02:19:03,210
it's like beautiful cannabis profiles

3019
02:18:58,290 --> 02:19:06,060
cannabis terpene profiles well [ __ ]

3020
02:19:03,209 --> 02:19:09,479
Jerry Lee Lewis is dead huh well it's

3021
02:19:06,059 --> 02:19:11,189

02:20:04,489 --> 02:20:08,629
year around hurricane time which is

3043
02:20:06,620 --> 02:20:11,240
Labor Day weekend he did his telethon

3044
02:20:08,629 --> 02:20:12,858
and raised you know how many millions of

3045
02:20:11,239 --> 02:20:15,680
dollars and awareness to you know

3046
02:20:12,859 --> 02:20:19,510
diseases and you know helped many so

3047
02:20:15,680 --> 02:20:23,600

3048
02:20:19,510 --> 02:20:28,340
started as a crazy actor he is mad sons

3049
02:20:23,600 --> 02:20:30,489
after humanitarian you don't see it

3050
02:20:28,340 --> 02:20:34,159
every day

3051
02:20:30,489 --> 02:20:37,969
Wow so I've slowly melt that all the way

3052
02:20:34,159 --> 02:20:41,978
down off the edges 105 people die a

3053
02:20:37,969 --> 02:20:44,420
minute 105 people die minute on earth

3054
02:20:41,978 --> 02:20:47,750
how many people are born though a minute

3055
02:20:44,420 --> 02:20:50,809
I don't know that's the real question

3056
02:20:47,750 --> 02:20:53,600
right yeah exactly

3057
02:20:50,809 --> 02:20:57,859
but then again every once in a while but

3058
02:20:53,600 --> 02:21:00,640
that's that 106 are born every minute

3059
02:20:57,859 --> 02:21:08,020
and how many are dead every minute

3060
02:21:00,639 --> 02:21:10,909
hundred of five so it's one in one out

3061
02:21:08,020 --> 02:21:14,960
jeez how many people really die every

3062
02:21:10,909 --> 02:21:18,739
minute yeah

3063
02:21:14,959 --> 02:21:20,449
I'm just screwing around would you say

3064
02:21:18,739 --> 02:21:22,159
that term was bubble man would you say

3065
02:21:20,450 --> 02:21:24,409
it was how many people die per minute

3066
02:21:22,159 --> 02:21:26,090
now I'm in an argument because people

3067
02:21:24,409 --> 02:21:28,279
are like oh I can't believe you put him

3068
02:21:26,090 --> 02:21:30,350
down like I didn't mean to put him down

3069
02:21:28,279 --> 02:21:32,420
as well I've mentioned that mention that

3070
02:21:30,350 --> 02:21:33,649
millions of other people are dying as

3071
02:21:32,420 --> 02:21:36,200
well and although they may not have

3072
02:21:33,648 --> 02:21:36,569
raised money for MIT for children and

3073
02:21:36,200 --> 02:21:39,420
disease

3074
02:21:36,569 --> 02:21:41,220
Jesus it doesn't make them any less sort

3075
02:21:39,420 --> 02:21:43,079
of I don't know we put a lot of weird

3076
02:21:41,220 --> 02:21:45,449
[ __ ] into Fame and when people are

3077
02:21:43,079 --> 02:21:47,190
famous regardless of what they do he

3078
02:21:45,450 --> 02:21:49,440
didn't even have to raise money for kids

3079
02:21:47,190 --> 02:21:51,710
he could have written a [ __ ] song and

3080
02:21:49,440 --> 02:21:54,601
we would have all been like home alright

3081
02:21:51,709 --> 02:21:57,449
so instead no I know I know but you know

3082
02:21:54,601 --> 02:22:00,360
you don't have here I know I know I'm

3083
02:21:57,450 --> 02:22:02,909
just saying it's like I we tend to put

3084
02:22:00,360 --> 02:22:05,700
certain people on pedestals above other

3085
02:22:02,909 --> 02:22:08,369
people and all I'm saying is hey r.i.p

3086
02:22:05,700 --> 02:22:13,710

lewis but just yeah saying hey jerry

3088
02:22:13,709 --> 02:22:19,560
lewis and one of the things that he did

3089
02:22:16,620 --> 02:22:22,620
that I liked was he only wore a pair of

3090
02:22:19,560 --> 02:22:26,610
socks once and then he gave them away

3091
02:22:22,620 --> 02:22:30,721
yeah you know who else does that Floyd

3092
02:22:26,610 --> 02:22:34,261
money Mayweather wears a new pair of

3093
02:22:30,720 --> 02:22:37,909
socks once every time why do I know that

3094
02:22:34,261 --> 02:22:43,880
because my head is full of useless [ __ ]

3095
02:22:37,909 --> 02:22:43,879
what am I gonna do life is fragile

3100
02:22:58,950 --> 02:23:03,120
great person I'm sure he was why I

3101
02:23:00,659 --> 02:23:05,399
didn't know him at all in any way shape

3102
02:23:03,120 --> 02:23:09,920
or form for all I know he ran some

3103

well he was an interesting guy

3105
02:23:12,870 --> 02:23:15,540
I wouldn't put the past he could have

3106
02:23:14,310 --> 02:23:16,729
done that too and he still would have

3107
02:23:15,540 --> 02:23:21,721
been all right

3108
02:23:16,729 --> 02:23:25,289

02:23:40,590 --> 02:23:44,851
room reminded me of Casey Kasem like a

3116
02:23:43,140 --> 02:23:46,590
guy who just kept getting older but

3117

3120
02:23:53,450 --> 02:23:58,130
wanted to be oh that's what I wanted to

3121
02:23:56,420 --> 02:24:09,739
say how many people are I think of a

3122
02:23:58,129 --> 02:24:12,289
Nutty Professor yeah I can't imagine

3123
02:24:09,739 --> 02:24:15,530
Dana Larson lobbying the BC government

3124
02:24:12,290 --> 02:24:19,070
to use micro butanol we'd have to have

3125
02:24:15,530 --> 02:24:23,570
Dana on to talk about that but well

3126
02:24:19,069 --> 02:24:26,539
maybe next week well I'm gonna get some

3127
02:24:23,569 --> 02:24:33,170
food and for those that did get the

3128
02:24:26,540 --> 02:24:34,760
tanks just to know that you know you're

3129
02:24:33,170 --> 02:24:39,739
gonna need some glass syringe or some

3130
02:24:34,760 --> 02:24:43,639
little small applicator I use a glass

3131
02:24:39,739 --> 02:24:45,319
syringe with a 14 gauge or 12 gauge the

3132
02:24:43,639 --> 02:24:48,949
biggest one they have to pull it up and

3133
02:24:45,319 --> 02:24:50,659
then I use the smaller like 10 gauge tip

3134
02:24:48,950 --> 02:24:54,700
I just switched the tip to a smaller one

3135
02:24:50,659 --> 02:24:57,379
to fill up to fill it up I've got Gary

3136
02:24:54,700 --> 02:24:59,720
finding ones for us right now so they

3137
02:24:57,379 --> 02:25:01,569
can be included in the kits in the air

3138
02:24:59,719 --> 02:25:05,149
yeah for sure

3139
02:25:01,569 --> 02:25:06,469
well he raised two billion dollars - yes

3140
02:25:05,149 --> 02:25:10,069
muscular dystrophy

3141
02:25:06,469 --> 02:25:12,139
so here's the thing has a person have

3142
02:25:10,069 --> 02:25:14,060
there been any breakthroughs in must

3143
02:25:12,139 --> 02:25:15,770
muscular dystrophy with that 2 billion

3144
02:25:14,060 --> 02:25:17,060
dollars there must have been cuz I

3145
02:25:15,771 --> 02:25:19,280
always am leery of sort of

3146
02:25:17,060 --> 02:25:20,719
pharmaceutical raising like the money to

3147
02:25:19,280 --> 02:25:24,110
raise for disease like the cancer

3148
02:25:20,719 --> 02:25:26,539
raising I think it was more like giving

3149
02:25:24,110 --> 02:25:30,500
them a home or like a hospital bed or

3150
02:25:26,540 --> 02:25:33,320
like care not so much like which is

3151
02:25:30,500 --> 02:25:35,209
right and to st. Jude's Hospital rise

3152
02:25:33,319 --> 02:25:37,520
like that you know it's a pretty serious

3153
02:25:35,209 --> 02:25:40,669
dude that's why I think you billion

3154
02:25:37,521 --> 02:25:45,170
dollars dude audience was was right to

3155
02:25:40,670 --> 02:25:49,149
jump on you a little bit yeah kids he

3156
02:25:45,170 --> 02:25:52,819
gave to the kids well like I said r.i.p

3157
02:25:49,149 --> 02:25:54,709
ya know kind of like the cancer research

3158
02:25:52,819 --> 02:25:56,959
money that's what I'm saying star Delta

3159
02:25:54,709 --> 02:25:58,909
I'm always worried about so it's a lot

3160
02:25:56,959 --> 02:26:01,909
of you'd have to have an incredible team

3161
02:25:58,909 --> 02:26:02,389
of people in charge of raising money and

3162
02:26:01,909 --> 02:26:04,639
just

3163
02:26:02,389 --> 02:26:06,439
meaning it accurately that would be

3164
02:26:04,639 --> 02:26:08,930
something that just seems like human

3165
02:26:06,439 --> 02:26:11,449
nature would be you'd really really

3166
02:26:08,930 --> 02:26:13,398
really really have to watch that well

3167
02:26:11,449 --> 02:26:15,350
think about this think about how much of

3168
02:26:13,398 --> 02:26:17,028
a good person you must have been to be

3169
02:26:15,350 --> 02:26:19,970
able to do that because how many

3170
02:26:17,029 --> 02:26:23,870
companies out there actually can grossly

3171
02:26:19,969 --> 02:26:26,028
pull in two billion dollars let alone

3172
02:26:23,870 --> 02:26:27,590
make two billion he's trying to give it

3173
02:26:26,029 --> 02:26:31,579
away he's trying to collect it

3174
02:26:27,590 --> 02:26:33,680
stack it stamp it certify it and give it

3175
02:26:31,579 --> 02:26:36,590
away well you got to realize Saint Jude

3176
02:26:33,680 --> 02:26:38,300
hospital doesn't charge families if

3177
02:26:36,590 --> 02:26:40,398
you're accepted there it's covered

3178
02:26:38,299 --> 02:26:42,408
exactly and I donate to them too yeah

3179
02:26:40,398 --> 02:26:44,719
and I have as well because you know

3180
02:26:42,408 --> 02:26:47,119
they're they're at the forefront they're

3181
02:26:44,719 --> 02:26:49,188
literally at the spear tip of helping

3182
02:26:47,120 --> 02:26:52,640
and definitely pushing things on a level

3183
02:26:49,189 --> 02:26:54,670
that you know a Schnurr and all kinds of

3184
02:26:52,639 --> 02:26:56,689
other for you know forefront of

3185
02:26:54,670 --> 02:26:59,120
hospitals are doing and it's really

3186
02:26:56,689 --> 02:27:00,648
needed because these are if to see kids

3187
02:26:59,120 --> 02:27:02,689
suffering is horrible it's bad enough

3188
02:27:00,648 --> 02:27:06,500
seeing adults suffering but seeing kids

3189
02:27:02,689 --> 02:27:08,840
suffering is yeah it yeah it wreaks us

3190
02:27:06,500 --> 02:27:12,500
it's everybody in the soul it's

3191
02:27:08,840 --> 02:27:14,510
definitely [ __ ] up in fact are we

3192
02:27:12,500 --> 02:27:16,908
gotta send a shout-out to forest we

3193
02:27:14,510 --> 02:27:18,738
invited him today and he hasn't been

3194
02:27:16,908 --> 02:27:20,770
able to come because Silas had a bad

3195
02:27:18,738 --> 02:27:22,879
night last night he's not doing too well

3196
02:27:20,770 --> 02:27:26,120
so we'll put our thoughts and prayers

3197
02:27:22,879 --> 02:27:27,769
with with those guys and all suffering

3198
02:27:26,120 --> 02:27:31,699
children everywhere my goodness we're

3199
02:27:27,770 --> 02:27:34,329
definitely it's a it's a terrible thing

3200
02:27:31,699 --> 02:27:37,040
for kids to be born with some of these

3201
02:27:34,329 --> 02:27:39,709
diseases and some of these obstacles

3202
02:27:37,040 --> 02:27:42,620
that you just can't really fathom or

3203
02:27:39,709 --> 02:27:44,028
imagine yet some of them come out of you

3204
02:27:42,620 --> 02:27:46,970
know it lived throughout these

3205
02:27:44,029 --> 02:27:49,790
experiences with such strength that it's

3206
02:27:46,969 --> 02:27:51,920
very inspirational and the cost the

3207
02:27:49,790 --> 02:27:54,560
hidden costs of the caregivers and those

3208
02:27:51,920 --> 02:27:58,219
that have to take care of those such as

3209
02:27:54,559 --> 02:28:01,398
forests that sacrifice I mean I watched

3210
02:27:58,219 --> 02:28:03,108
him I'm multiple posts you know over

3211
02:28:01,398 --> 02:28:05,658
time of different things you know

3212
02:28:03,109 --> 02:28:08,658
they're planned to attend but now that

3213
02:28:05,658 --> 02:28:12,049
changes because everything becomes the

3214
02:28:08,658 --> 02:28:14,840
most important is the child then in that

3215
02:28:12,049 --> 02:28:16,129
situation and it's they sacrifice so

3216
02:28:14,840 --> 02:28:18,319
much for their kids so

3217
02:28:16,129 --> 02:28:20,000
much love and respect there well he was

3218
02:28:18,319 --> 02:28:23,689
saying last time for us was saying that

3219
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:25,549
the divorce rate is 87 percent for you

3220
02:28:23,689 --> 02:28:27,319
know parents of these catastrophic ly

3221
02:28:25,549 --> 02:28:29,420
ill children and and that's just what's

3222
02:28:27,319 --> 02:28:31,969
notated so it's probably been higher

3223
02:28:29,420 --> 02:28:33,049
than that if you know house you know if

3224
02:28:31,969 --> 02:28:35,539
they're rich they're not reaching

3225
02:28:33,049 --> 02:28:37,819

about Forrest and Silas he's really had

3233
02:28:52,309 --> 02:29:02,329
a rough week a couple hours a night of

3234
02:28:56,530 --> 02:29:03,890
when Silas isn't sleep seizing and Silas

3235
02:29:02,329 --> 02:29:06,139
was supposed to start school this week

3236
02:29:03,889 --> 02:29:12,369

3237
02:29:06,139 --> 02:29:12,369
to class yet that's too bad mmm-hmm

3238
02:29:12,489 --> 02:29:16,579
sorry for my late joining this morning

3239
02:29:15,319 --> 02:29:18,889

02:29:16,579 --> 02:29:20,840
oh no problem glad you made it in we're

3241
02:29:18,889 --> 02:29:23,148
not gonna be going to too much longer

3242
02:29:20,840 --> 02:29:26,659
it's been a pretty chill chill day but

3243
02:29:23,148 --> 02:29:31,279
definitely want to build a good audience

3244
02:29:26,659 --> 02:29:33,530
and a big a good group for the 150

3245
02:29:31,280 --> 02:29:36,020
whatever it'll be I guess it's fifty two

3246
02:29:33,530 --> 02:29:40,970
fifty two fifty two hundred and fifty

3247
02:29:36,020 --> 02:29:44,930
six episodes it'll be nice a nice

3248
02:29:40,969 --> 02:29:47,719
gathering in here so we can have like 20

3249
02:29:44,930 --> 02:29:49,250
or 30 or 40 panelists come through over

3250
02:29:47,719 --> 02:29:51,409
the course of the four hours and just

3251
02:29:49,250 --> 02:29:53,389
really organize a cool little

3252
02:29:51,409 --> 02:29:57,139
conversation maybe even have some people

3253
02:29:53,389 --> 02:29:59,629
like nya Hawkins on you know for who's

3254
02:29:57,139 --> 02:30:02,869
on an earlier episodes get Samantha elf

3255
02:29:59,629 --> 02:30:06,859
and vlv why don't you do a 50-50 panel

3256
02:30:02,870 --> 02:30:09,140
women and men like do a rotational like

3257
02:30:06,860 --> 02:30:12,710
how you had the the ladies my money win

3258
02:30:09,139 --> 02:30:14,478
yeah they got some roughly 20 men and 20

3259
02:30:12,709 --> 02:30:16,309
women but they would help organize it

3260
02:30:14,478 --> 02:30:17,840
too because the way that went was like

3261
02:30:16,309 --> 02:30:20,059
that's the only way you're gonna get

3262
02:30:17,840 --> 02:30:21,530
like you know the way they were they

3263
02:30:20,059 --> 02:30:26,680
just came a little bit more organized

3264
02:30:21,530 --> 02:30:29,230
than us it's true I can't organize

3265
02:30:26,681 --> 02:30:32,530
the dudes it's like impossible but she

3266
02:30:29,229 --> 02:30:36,310
attaches like I sent him emails I sent

3267
02:30:32,530 --> 02:30:39,551
out messages it was like this CNN panel

3268
02:30:36,310 --> 02:30:41,351
where was like it was like everyone had

3269
02:30:39,550 --> 02:30:44,109
the exact same shot of the exact

3270
02:30:41,351 --> 02:30:46,091
shoulder thing now all keyed in the

3271
02:30:44,110 --> 02:30:48,250
exact lighting was good for everyone

3272
02:30:46,091 --> 02:30:50,710
they had all perfect sound and it was

3273
02:30:48,250 --> 02:30:51,940
like and it was in and out in and out

3274
02:30:50,709 --> 02:30:54,310

just absolutely insanity so like not

3277
02:30:58,989 --> 02:31:04,979
just a little bit different than us like

3278
02:31:00,851 --> 02:31:08,440
I mean noticeably more organized I know

3279
02:31:04,979 --> 02:31:10,779
noticeably huge props it was they were

3280
02:31:08,440 --> 02:31:12,909
very impressive I learned a lot yet I

3281
02:31:10,780 --> 02:31:16,120
don't know how to execute any of what I

3282
02:31:12,909 --> 02:31:17,709
learned so I feel like I feel like we've

3283
02:31:16,120 --> 02:31:20,170
been making like mashed potatoes and

3284

3286
02:31:21,640 --> 02:31:26,140

3287
02:31:23,170 --> 02:31:28,989
they came in and like just boom moose

3288
02:31:26,140 --> 02:31:31,390

3289
02:31:28,989 --> 02:31:34,959
