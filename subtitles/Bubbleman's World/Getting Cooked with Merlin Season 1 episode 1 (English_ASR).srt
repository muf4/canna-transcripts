harm like you said

37
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,799
i brought a flat bread with a ball of

38
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:44,158
fresh mozzarella cheese and i don't know

39
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,600
if you have sauce but i actually brought

40
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,079
some sauce too i figured we could do a

41
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:51,519
little starter flatbread

42
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:54,000
yeah in the oven some

43
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:55,679
some of the mushrooms some mozzarella

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,959
you know a little bit of garlic a little

45
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,159
bit of sauce

46
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:59,839
well i think what we're going to do is

47
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,600
we'll fry all these mushrooms with the

48
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,280
onion and the garlic keep them on the

49
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:05,039
side and then mix it with all the pasta

50
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,399
with the sage butter is ready i love it

51
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,640
i'm thinking a similar thing for the

52
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,759
pizza like i think i would fry i think

53
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,679
that's what we're gonna do fry the

54
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,958
mushrooms up with some garlic and butter

55
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,400
this and this all together we'll

56
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,000
separate some a little bit of that can

57
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,920
go on top of the pizza even in the last

58
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,239
like two minutes of baking it yeah let

59

172
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:13,199
circle yeah

173
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:13,199
no

174
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:17,038
here

175
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,439
that'll help with that if you heat it up

176
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:21,680
a bit first with the torch yeah and then

177
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:23,038
pour that in it'll melt it and pull it

178
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,720
off but it's going to put it all on the

179
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:26,399
sides of the wall so i usually just have

180
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,240
one of these that i just sit right there

181
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:29,839
as it's doing it

182
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,840
like you don't know how to clean the

183
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:34,079
banger

184
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:36,239
giving him a mansplaining to merlin how

185
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:37,199

187

men do it to each other too oh it's our

188
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:43,439
oh my goodness this is not something we

189
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:45,439
just do to females my apologies to all

190
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:46,959
the females i've ever done it too

191
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:48,879
it's a disease i'm trying to break

192
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:52,399
myself of it i just told my girl that

193
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,400
she had to clean the banger properly

194
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:56,159
you were mansplaining yet i was

195
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:00,318
kim's cool

196
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,478
kim would never take that the wrong way

197
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,479
no

198
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:10,399
all right

199
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:12,240
tasty tasty treats

200
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:14,638
you know dabs are similar to a

201
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,319
multi-course meal you know instead of

202
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,319
having what would really be a session

203
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,240
where you're smoking joints and haunted

204
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,319
stuff afterwards yeah yeah yeah you have

205
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,800
like a dab yeah and then you're like no

206
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,639
we'll try this one for a little bit yeah

207
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,160
please do

208
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,079
please do

209
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,158
that will come onto the uh come off onto

210
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:34,559
your dabber really nicely it's still got

211
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:36,319
a nice uh texture it's gonna butter out

212
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,718
soon though

213
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,120
oh yeah that's a nice texture yeah it'll

214
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:44,159
pull out nice that's for sure

215
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,560
kind of pulling snappy

216
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:46,559
okay

217
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:54,278
excellent another little cold start for

218
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:54,278
you yeah

219
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,600
here i'll get the rest off for you

220
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,760
joint smoker

221
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,000
you got some in there yeah i did

222
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:17,838
i don't like to do big dabs anyway

223
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,320
well

224
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,240
i like your style

225
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,040
a bunch of small dab is better than one

226
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,480
big one that hurts your legs forever

227
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:28,559
yeah i'm pretty consistent i don't know

228
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,320
if what i i don't know if what i hit is

229
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:32,399
small because most i certainly don't

230
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,760
think this is big either but it's not

231
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,360
something i give to people that don't

232
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:36,720
dab a lot

233
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,639
you know because even what you put in

234
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,240
there it was a very very little bit but

235
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:41,759
look how much it turned into when it

236
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,080
when it expanded

237
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:45,679
exactly and it i just like little puffs

238
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,600
like that that just tastes super good

239
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:50,000
i'd rather do it that's not like sheer

240
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,759
terps yeah

241
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,159
with the carb cap on the cold start it

242
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:56,319
really stays all those volatile stains

243
00:09:54,159 --> 00:10:00,079
oh yeah well you're getting first just

244
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:02,000
the volatiles you're getting tur pits

245
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,920
and then you're kind of finishing it off

246
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,159
towards the end it won't have near the

247
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:07,679
flavor but that's where all the strength

248
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:11,679
will lie

249
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:14,958
i like cold starting but i do prefer

250
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:17,359
just hitting it from the start to finish

251
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:18,319
if i can get it in one or two small

252
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,759
poles

253
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,920
that being said

254
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:23,919
i mean there's nothing tastier than just

255
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:25,838
hitting the turf

256
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:27,278
starving you know what i mean yeah it's

257
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,279
always that first hit that's like that

258
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:31,600
person off the joint oh my god i always

259
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:32,958
called it the king's hit or the queen's

260
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,639
hit

261
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:37,039
you know because that was like man could

262
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:38,480
you imagine if the only hits you took

263
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:40,480
were those always tasted like you're

264
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,360
just like i'm the queen king of england

265
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,000
england

266
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,919
i'm smoking only first starts

267
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,320
essentially that's how dabs are though

268
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:49,919
compared to joints you know like a joint

269
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,839
for the in comparison the amount of

270
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:53,519
totes that you get you get that first

271
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,519
two or three tasty ones and then after

272
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,519
that it's like it's good but dude and i

273
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,720
can even still hear people like arguing

274
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,799
with us in the comments right now

275
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,480
because i do remember when i was younger

276
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:04,319
at least thinking

277
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,320
that some of that [ __ ] tasted good right

278
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,000
down until it was burning my fingers but

279
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,000
you were lying to yourself i might have

280
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,679
been yeah i might i must have been i've

281
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,759
said that's interesting cognitive

282
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:15,439
dissonance is definitely interesting and

283
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:17,600
how it creates in

284
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,200
our reality the one we experience at

285
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,120
least remember the guy in high school

286
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,640
that was always like i like the taste of

287
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,240
roaches

288
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:27,039
i had a roach collection that was like

289
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,919
several pounds towards the end and i

290
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:32,000
remember i gave it away through a friend

291
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:34,159
that ended up giving it

292
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,639
i can't remember who got it but they

293
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:39,039
said that those roaches lasted them and

294
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:40,799
the person who got it was

295
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:42,319
you know someone who loved cannabis but

296
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:43,439
didn't have a lot of money to spend on

297
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,240
cannabis

298
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,560
and because i was going to throw it away

299
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,399
no they were huge fat crazy hazes and

300
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:51,919
all like special like

301
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,000
they might have looked like garbage to

302
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:55,919
most people but that person

303
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
really appreciated it and i remember

304
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:59,199
them saying like i got two christmases

305
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,879
out of it

306
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,200
it's like celebration like they were

307
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:06,240
celebrating like bubble beds all men's

308
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:10,879
roads yeah well and that's from the day

309
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,759
exactly it was like 97 98 and then by 99

310
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:14,159
hit

311
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:15,759
i was just puffing only bubble yeah once

312
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:17,600
i could make this stuff i was like are

313
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:19,600

314

00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:33,838
guy's body that leads the interesting

320

322
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:40,559
i was like i don't always smoke joints

323
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:42,559
but when i do they're pure hats

324
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:44,000
you know that is a good it's the same or

325
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:45,919

326
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,839

327
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:49,360
man thank you i knew you knew

328
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,440
you know

329

all right well listen i'm appropriately

330
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,440
baked i might have one more rip here in

331
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:58,000
a second but uh we're gonna go make this

332
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,560
food because really this whole video

333
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,639
has been about the inspiration of the

334
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:05,199
last scene of putting the plates down

335
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,720
and showing you what can be done

336
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,560
and you can see how we did it it was

337
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,639
very fun we got to take brixton for a

338
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:12,879
walk we got to explore the forest we got

339
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,879
to discover new mushrooms

340
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:16,399
um and now we're going to eat eat them

341
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,838
and enjoy them so

342
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:21,039
satisfying would you catch yeah let's do

345
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,360
forage all right so merlin has prepared

346
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,679
pretty much everything here he's just

347
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,680
kind of doing some finishing touches and

348
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:33,278
he's kind of gonna walk us through how

349
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:34,958
he's gonna prepare

350
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:37,120
this dish and i'm just going to be the

351
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:39,518
cameraman and the voice behind the

352
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,440
camera there you go

353
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,679
cast iron pan

354
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,680
hot

355
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:51,559
preheat it nice start with the onions

356
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,560
get them caramelized a little

357
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,289
a little olive oil there

358
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,079
you just want to make them translucent

359
00:14:06,289 --> 00:14:11,078
[Music]

360
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:11,078
nice

361
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,480
so the other day we were driving and you

362
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:23,919
told me your favorite line from the

363
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:26,800
sopranos that you finally kind of got it

364
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:28,719
yeah the best the best line is from in

365
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:30,479
sopranos is tony when he says

366
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,560
christopher you'll understand the

367
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:35,199
importance of good produce and when you

368
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:36,399
get older and it's the best line out of

369
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:38,319
the entire

370
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,078
series in my opinion

371
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:44,199
that's awesome

372
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:44,198
pepper up those efforts yeah

373
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:53,120
all right those are getting close

374
00:14:54,078 --> 00:14:59,198
now next step is we'll turn our water on

375
00:14:57,278 --> 00:15:00,720
get our pasta boiling we've got our

376
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:04,879
tagatelli there

377
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:06,800
and then our pizza as well what's that

378
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:08,720
he's feeling we're filming

379
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:11,359
come say hi

380
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:14,959
don't be sorry

381
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,959
so now we'll get the mushrooms

382
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,000
oh yeah

383
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:23,440
about uh

384
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,559
60 dollars worth of mushrooms

385
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:28,320
that's awesome

386
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:29,838
you have one other kind right here too

387
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,360
these are the yellow mushrooms all right

388
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,440
all right so we'll just slice these ones

389
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,440
up

390
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:39,278
what's that

391
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:41,198
uh i film with this uh panasonic

392
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:41,820
this little 4k unit

393
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:44,159
here

394
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:45,759
[Music]

395
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:48,480
yeah we're filming for the channel right

396
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:51,278
now we're just uh merlin's walking us

397
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,039
through uh the homemade pasta with the

398
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:55,120
mushroom

399
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:56,480
how beautiful sauce looks yeah it looks

400
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,320
really nice

401
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,800
now once the mushrooms are in you don't

402
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,160
want to move them much you want to get

403
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:04,240
the water to

404
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:06,399
to stay inside the mushroom rather than

405
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,399
get the whole pan super soggy

406
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:12,078
and put your garlic on after

407
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:14,399
so once they're mixed in don't move them

408
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:15,679
for until they sear in

409
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,399
all right

410
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:18,399
there's a time

411
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:24,879
oh no you're running out of time

412
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,959
he's like don't worry i'm growing it in

413
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:35,078
a plant out back

414
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:35,078
you got one of those time plants

415
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,159
let that sit

416
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:42,399
this is coming along salt your water

417
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:44,319
that tastes like the seed

418
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:46,240
we'll do this bread too we'll create a

419
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,800
bit of cheese for it

420
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,720
i'm gonna make a mushroom sauce for this

421
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:53,359
flatbread yeah and then this is

422
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,360
mozzarella

423
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,318
at this point you can see the water kind

424
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:08,240
of bubbling out of there you really want

425
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:10,558
to get all that moisture out of the

426
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,160
mushrooms so that they can caramelize

427
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:14,000
yeah it's steaming nicely look it's

428
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,319
steamed at the front of the camera it's

429
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,318
awesome

430
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:21,759
did i clean it well not really and then

431
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,600
for the towel i guess we'll just get

432
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:25,119
that um

433
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:27,119
yeah you got the water boiling got a

434
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:30,399
little salt in there oh yeah lots of

435
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,399
salt it tastes like the sea

436
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,160
i'm gonna get the tagatell in there

437
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:38,319
this is gonna be super quick and then

438
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,720
we'll cool it down to stop it from

439
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:40,720
cooking

440
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,200
what's super quick like three four

441
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:47,119
minutes yeah at the moment

442
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,279
two three yeah

443
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:50,879
you're one really nice heat and not

444
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:53,200
really move them you want them to stay

445
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,360
like that it's definitely steaming less

446
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,319
yeah well you can see it bubbling out

447
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:58,079
here

448
00:17:56,319 --> 00:18:00,558
and that's just the flavor getting back

449
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:02,159
into the mushrooms

450
00:18:00,558 --> 00:18:05,279
you almost want to see like onions

451
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:07,679
starting to caramelize

452
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:09,839
before you start turning it

453
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,120
all right she's going oh i'm steaming

454
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:13,199
her up again

455
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:15,678
trying to get this food

456
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,679
so here we go pasta just came out of the

457
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,840
pot that was about three minutes

458
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:22,400
yeah

459
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:23,759
and these are still going hard

460
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,759
and the onions are starting to

461
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:29,440
caramelize and there's a lot well

462
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:31,038
there's almost no more water um

463
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,279
bubbling but definitely certainly there

464
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:34,640
is moisture coming off of the mushrooms

465
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:37,440
you really want to cool these noodle

466
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:39,200
boxes yeah

467
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:42,640
oh yeah so they're not still cooking in

468
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:46,400
themselves exactly

469
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,400
now you're ready to take that around

470
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,919
well you know as much as i saw that as a

471
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:55,879
first turn it really looked like a

472
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:55,880
second or a third time

473
00:18:56,319 --> 00:19:00,319
first turns now we hit a little bit of

474
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:03,038
pepper

475
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:03,038
pepidepa

476
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,160
this is all looking quite well

477
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:26,319
mm-hmm

478
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:30,038
chop up a bit of garlic

479
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:30,038
this one for the pizza

480
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:43,279
a bit of ricotta

481
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,440

482
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:47,440

00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:05,759
we'll take all the flavor that's from in

508
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:09,600
this pan and we'll start making our safe

509
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:11,440
butter sauce for the pasta ah

510
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:13,929
and there'll be a lot of that flavor in

511
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:16,240
the pan won't there

iron

515
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:24,000
yeah and it's also consistency of heat

516
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:27,200
is the key to it

517
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,359
since it's kind of like a sage butter

518
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,679
tangerine some gin has a little piney

519
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:31,678
flavor

520
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:35,809
get all that flavor up from the

00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:41,309

well maybe we'll let this uh

525
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,759
melt up

526
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:13,359
just mix up with all that flavor on the

527
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:15,759
bottom

528
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:17,839
like the gin and the

529
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:20,839
butter and the mushroom

530
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:20,839
remnants

531
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:27,359
like heat on here

532
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:33,599
that smells so good it looks good

533
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:35,359
and it's only got like two sage leaves

534
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:37,918
in it

535
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:39,199
well then once we put all these in what

536
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:40,480
happens is these are going to pull out

537
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,798
all the

538
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,278
all that incredible flavor

539
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:47,759
but they also crisp up and turn into

540
00:23:45,278 --> 00:23:48,720
sage leaf chips which are all right i

541
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:51,278
love them

542
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:54,798
the best yeah

candied sage leaf buttered

00:23:54,798 --> 00:24:01,440
buttered to perfection

545
00:23:57,839 --> 00:24:01,439
so i'm just gonna let this go

546
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,480
what's that

547
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:08,720
a pizza it's a flapper that looks really

nice

00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:13,359
yeah we've got some pizza cheese on

00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:16,559
there

551
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:16,558
not too much cheese

less is better

00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:24,798
on pizzas it's not that

00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:24,798
it's not dominoes

555
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:34,960
there we go

556
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:34,959
um we'll heat up the pan too

00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:41,359
making pizza

in an oven

560
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:46,798
preheat your pan

561
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:49,359
and we get crispy dough

562
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:52,000
very good advice yeah

563
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:54,000
500 degrees get in there for a good 5-10

564
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,798
minutes heat it up and then just slide

565
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,839
your pizza in on some parchment paper

566
00:24:56,798 --> 00:25:01,519
a little garlic in there as

567
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:03,439
well this is looking pretty nice you

568
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:05,038
threw a clove of garlic in there oh yeah

569
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,960
a little extra flavor

570
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:10,960
oh yeah did you break that or anything

571
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,960
yeah just crushed it okay yeah i figured

572
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,558
now we're almost turning this to

573
00:25:12,798 --> 00:25:17,519
clarified butter as you can see all that

574
00:25:14,558 --> 00:25:19,278
foam coming off that's all the lactose

575
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:21,440
essentially if you cook butter down

576
00:25:19,278 --> 00:25:24,880
enough and keep taping taking that foam

577
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,880
off it becomes ghee yes

578
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:30,158
but flavor is starting to happen you

579
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:31,470
want your butter to be like a brown

580
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,559

a little nice amount of little olive oil

on the side crisp it up

concentrates the heat on those tips and

594
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:15,200
gives them a little darkening huh yeah

separately to keep their flavors intact

mix up mushrooms with everything so you

lose the flavor

that's the key

now
