6

pretty busy morning here but I never

00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:16,740
forget about my wake-and-bake crew

on the boat the water is like glass

10
00:00:18,868 --> 00:00:23,100

18
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:41,128

time to get this bowl out and have a

70
00:02:50,818 --> 00:02:55,469

71
00:02:53,969 --> 00:02:58,669

72
00:02:55,469 --> 00:03:00,900

77
00:03:08,009 --> 00:03:15,780
little calm wake-and-bake after I clean

78
00:03:13,829 --> 00:03:18,750
my pepper I'll tell you here's a pet

79
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:20,219
peeve of mine the dabber never gets

80
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:22,500
cleaned properly

81
00:03:20,219 --> 00:03:24,539
nobody cleans off the dabber when they

82
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:27,150
take their rip and so at the end of the

83
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:30,269
session once I've already developed out

84
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:32,909
you know a dozen or so rips I find that

85
00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:34,829
my dabber needs to get put away and

86
00:03:32,909 --> 00:03:37,409
brought somewhere and then generally I

87
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:39,120
put it somewhere stupid get fibers all

88
00:03:37,409 --> 00:03:41,039
over it and have to do the old clean

89
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,889
with your fingers mentality which is

90
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:45,599
fine until you get transfer until I

91
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:48,359
start sticking my hands everywhere and

92
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:50,340
then I'd the whole boats full of full of

93
00:03:48,359 --> 00:03:52,829
resin which is fine clean before and

94
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,719
after I like yeah me too tough puffin

95
00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:56,819
but I don't when I'm puffing with like

96
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:57,959
five or six other people and then I feel

97
00:03:56,818 --> 00:04:00,358
like why the [ __ ] should I be taking

98
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:02,250

about on this beautiful wake-and-bake

200
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:24,139
why is it that that that first bake of

201
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:25,940
the day I mean I could wait eight hours

202
00:09:24,139 --> 00:09:28,669
after I do my first bank of the day the

203
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:30,290
amount of time that I sleep and I won't

204
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:31,939
feel the same way there really is

205
00:09:30,289 --> 00:09:33,889
something about sleeping and waking up

206
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:36,500
and enjoying cannabinoids for the first

207
00:09:33,889 --> 00:09:38,509
time I'm sure there's a science behind

208
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,559
it that explains you know there's

209
00:09:38,509 --> 00:09:42,610
something a little bit different going

210
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:45,109
on after a good sleep

230
00:10:29,289 --> 00:10:34,159

231
00:10:33,019 --> 00:10:35,870
it was so good to see him the other day

232
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:40,039
he came by my house and picked up a

233
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:42,350
trailer he's really busy guy now it's

234
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:44,000
good to see him blowing up in his life

235
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:46,100
and doing so good with his business and

236
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,840
his grows back on and

237
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:50,240
I mean what can you say about Johnny B

238
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:54,050
he's literally an all-around awesome guy

239
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:55,850
he's the people's man how about a light

240
00:10:54,049 --> 00:10:57,709
anyone everyone someone you want to like

241
00:10:55,850 --> 00:11:00,379
I'll give you a like there you go

242
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:02,000
I like it you try any of his crop I

243
00:11:00,379 --> 00:11:07,700
smoked a little bit of his crop yeah he

244
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:09,500
brought some Medi cush Mitte cush ready

245
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,970
one Medi cush Jesus can't believe I

246
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,279
forgot the name of that uh yeah he

247
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:15,050
brought some of the rosin that he made

248
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:17,629
I'm not gonna lie I miss the days where

249
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:19,729
Johnny B had hash Johnny B doesn't have

250
00:11:17,629 --> 00:11:21,159
hash too much these days he's got rosin

251
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:23,539
which is really the case for everyone

252
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:25,370
which isn't the worst case in the in the

253
00:11:23,539 --> 00:11:26,870
world but it's definitely like when the

254
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:28,610
when the hash dries up and you start

255
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:30,799
seeing less and less of it it's

256
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:34,039
generally telling me that the material

257
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:36,289
is less good it's less quality and

258
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:38,389
therefore them they're all pressing it

259
00:11:36,289 --> 00:11:40,730
into into rosin because let's be honest

260
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:44,539
if you get a five or a six star you're

261
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:46,399
not going to be you're not gonna be

262
00:11:44,539 --> 00:11:50,240
doing it you're not gonna be pressing

263
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:57,549
that I don't Oh what camera lens do I

264
00:11:50,240 --> 00:12:02,269
use I use a 5d Mark mark three let's say

265
00:11:57,549 --> 00:12:04,639
canon and i use the MPE nice Brett yeah

266
00:12:02,269 --> 00:12:06,559
I get that from a lot of people I'm

267
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,059
gonna go on the grow to brown table

268
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:12,949
sometime Jack lees we're trying to get

269
00:12:08,059 --> 00:12:17,179

270
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:20,360
oh and we'll make it happen and sub cool

271
00:12:17,179 --> 00:12:25,939
set links before I don't think much

272
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:29,210
about h HT f SE myself alright do know

273
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:30,920
some people that just don't like hash

274
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:34,690
and we take rosin over sixty yeah John

275
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:37,490
you know what or Dan you know what I I

276
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:40,070
call [ __ ] I say if those people

277
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:42,259
actually had six-star resin like

278
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:45,350
constantly along with their oil they

279
00:12:42,259 --> 00:12:50,120
would very like it's just I've met very

280
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:52,310
few people who choose that oil over hash

281
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:54,080
when the hash is top quality most people

282
00:12:52,309 --> 00:12:55,819
don't have access to top quality hash

283
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,170
the type of hash that you see selling

284
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:59,278
for a hundred to two hundred dollars a

285
00:12:57,169 --> 00:13:02,039
gram six star that leaves

286
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:03,568
nothing behind it basically is oil they

287
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:06,328
say that because it's all they have

288
00:13:03,568 --> 00:13:09,899
exactly yeah it's easy to say that when

289
00:13:06,328 --> 00:13:11,698
you don't have six star you know but

290
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:13,019
having a bunch of six star and just

291
00:13:11,698 --> 00:13:14,429
seeing it sit there and go yeah I don't

292
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:17,879
even puff that [ __ ] I just hit the oil

293
00:13:14,429 --> 00:13:19,229
it's like now no no no no no what's the

294
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:20,909
price of six star out here if you can

295
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:25,170
find it it could be up to 100 bucks a

296
00:13:20,909 --> 00:13:27,509
gram easy yeah lots of people have been

297
00:13:25,169 --> 00:13:28,889
scared by meds for sure a lot of people

298
00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:30,808
when they think hash they just don't

299
00:13:28,889 --> 00:13:32,698
here's the bottom line there's something

300
00:13:30,808 --> 00:13:35,399
in the hash that's not in the oil the

301
00:13:32,698 --> 00:13:37,740
oil is pulling a specific fraction

302
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:41,399
depending on the polarity of it and it's

303
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:43,379
leaving behind certain things and when

304
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:45,058
you when you keep those certain things

305
00:13:43,379 --> 00:13:47,389
in particular that fibrous matte that

306
00:13:45,058 --> 00:13:51,120
all of the cannabinoids and terpenoids

307
00:13:47,389 --> 00:13:54,058
isten Svea there's something to be had

308
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:56,938
in there there's something that is more

309
00:13:54,058 --> 00:13:59,519
I feel like it's a full course meal

310
00:13:56,938 --> 00:14:01,259
compared to a dessert when I hit

311
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:05,339
Rossum's even when the rosin is made

312
00:14:01,259 --> 00:14:07,379
from hash now of course that's just my

313
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:08,639
opinion but you know as I get deeper

314
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:11,100
into these conversations with people

315
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,539
with different opinions it's often the

316
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,308
first thing I'll ask is do you have

317
00:14:12,539 --> 00:14:16,198
access to six star hash and is it always

318
00:14:14,308 --> 00:14:19,948
in your stash and the answer is pretty

319
00:14:16,198 --> 00:14:22,049
much 99% of the time no no I do not

320
00:14:19,948 --> 00:14:24,299
no I do not now they might think they

321
00:14:22,049 --> 00:14:27,479
smoked full melt but it might have been

322
00:14:24,299 --> 00:14:30,508
foam l2f aux because a lot of people

323
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:32,459
have the faux melt and so if you have

324
00:14:30,509 --> 00:14:33,899
the faux melt and you're hitting that

325
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:35,188
you're not gonna be impressed you're

326
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:37,078
seriously gonna be like you know what my

327
00:14:35,188 --> 00:14:39,389
oil is way better than that and I would

328
00:14:37,078 --> 00:14:41,849
agree with you but if you're hitting six

329
00:14:39,389 --> 00:14:43,980
star oh my god okay here's the thing if

330
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:45,899
you're hitting six star and you love oil

331
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:48,240
then here's something that you should do

332
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:48,539
take the six star and make your oil with

333
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,250
it

334
00:14:48,539 --> 00:14:51,778
because if you make oil with a full

335
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:53,220
whole plant you're pulling a lot of

336
00:14:51,778 --> 00:14:55,078
bulbous heads and I can promise you

337
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:56,370
those are the heads that if I could

338
00:14:55,078 --> 00:14:58,799
extract them and isolate them

339
00:14:56,370 --> 00:15:00,720
mechanically and separate them you would

340
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:02,609
see that they are not the heads you want

341
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,790
to smoke they make up a wonderful chunk

342
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:07,949
of yield and that's why oil goes from

343
00:15:04,789 --> 00:15:11,188
from hash going from ten to 12 to 15%

344
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:12,359
tops on returns you see oil getting into

345
00:15:11,188 --> 00:15:13,769
the 20s

346
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:16,980
that's because of those bulbous heads

347
00:15:13,769 --> 00:15:18,778
those heads have a profile they're just

348
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:21,269
not from my perspective a connoisseur

349
00:15:18,778 --> 00:15:24,389
smoked so if I was a big oil head I

350
00:15:21,269 --> 00:15:26,820
would still you know separate all my

351
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:29,730
gland heads via dry sifting or wet wash

352
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:32,160
make hash and then make your oil with

353
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:33,659
those specific heads whether you mix

354
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:35,909
them whether you make them all separate

355
00:15:33,659 --> 00:15:38,129
and have your 90 micron oh and your 73

356
00:15:35,909 --> 00:15:39,328
micro and oil is up to you but it

357
00:15:38,129 --> 00:15:43,078
definitely gives you a different

358
00:15:39,328 --> 00:15:43,979
overview of just removing those bulbous

359
00:15:43,078 --> 00:15:45,389
heads I don't want to call them

360
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:46,800
contaminants because they have medicinal

361
00:15:45,389 --> 00:15:49,679
components to them that are very

362
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:51,719
important I have a theory that they are

363
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:56,578
the ones that produce more of the CBD

364
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:58,170
and CBD high CBD ratio cultivars and the

365
00:15:56,578 --> 00:16:02,000
reason that is is because of when we

366
00:15:58,169 --> 00:16:04,588
make water hash or dry sift with

367
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,799
Halley's Comet or any of the high CBD

368
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:10,500
cultivars the yields are very very very

369
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:12,359
poor and generally most of those people

370
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:14,399
already know that oil is the best way to

371
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:16,949
go about whether it's a rosin process or

372
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:19,440
a chemical extraction you're going to

373
00:16:16,948 --> 00:16:21,299
need that melting factor to pull those

374
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,790
bulbous heads off and to acquire that

375
00:16:21,299 --> 00:16:26,909
profile

376
00:16:22,789 --> 00:16:28,799
Jannik 73 for the wind I'll tell you

377
00:16:26,909 --> 00:16:31,379
what a beautiful buzz out here on the

378
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:33,269
house sound really always enjoy hanging

379
00:16:31,379 --> 00:16:35,490
out with you guys and chillin with you I

380
00:16:33,269 --> 00:16:37,620
can give you some knowledge on curing

381
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:41,399
hasher you know curing is an opinion

382
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:43,129
it's not a fact so the way you cure and

383
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:45,448
we're not talking about drying okay Oh

384
00:16:43,129 --> 00:16:48,120
peace Brooklyn Hillier please send me

385
00:16:45,448 --> 00:16:50,879
the email BC bubbleman at icloud.com

386
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:53,190
today right away and I will absolutely

387
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:54,289
send you that I hope you're feeling

388
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:57,360
better buddy

389
00:16:54,289 --> 00:16:58,919
okay so drying and curing drying is very

390
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,350
different from curing we want to get the

391
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:03,809
moisture content out of the gland wax

392
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:05,220
membrane we want to make sure all the

393
00:17:03,809 --> 00:17:07,259
water that's on the outside of that

394
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:09,209
gland membrane is also dried off so it's

395
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:10,949
sort of a two-part process first getting

396
00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:11,500
the water on the outside of the gland

397
00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:15,610
heads

398
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:18,910
removed and then getting the moisture

399
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:21,818
content inside the wax membrane properly

400
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:27,670
removed once those are done you can now

401
00:17:21,818 --> 00:17:29,680
actually cure your hash people always

402
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:31,360
ask me what's the best way to cure your

403
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:33,850
hash well that's like asking me what's

404
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:36,159
the best time to cut your plants down

405
00:17:33,849 --> 00:17:38,649
and preserve the cannabinoid and terpene

406
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:41,710
profile as they are that's going to also

407
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:44,350
be an opinion so you know I tell people

408
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:45,819
try a variety of things with your plants

409
00:17:44,349 --> 00:17:48,339
cut them down a couple weeks early a

410
00:17:45,819 --> 00:17:50,589
week early right on time a week later a

411
00:17:48,339 --> 00:17:52,659
couple of weeks later find your sweet

412
00:17:50,589 --> 00:17:54,339
spot find the differences find the

413
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:56,710
changes that are occurring in the

414
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:59,500
cannabinoid and terpene profile in those

415
00:17:56,710 --> 00:18:02,140
specific times keep the data it's

416
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:04,029
valuable and then moving on to how do

417
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:06,910
you cure the resin well it's the same

418
00:18:04,029 --> 00:18:08,139
thing you can cure it okay if you're

419
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:09,910
putting it in a fridge or a freezer

420
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:12,730
that's more preserving it and although

421
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:14,800
you will moisture can be removed that

422
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:17,110
way and it can't affect terpene profiles

423
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:18,849
I don't really call it a cure I call it

424
00:18:17,109 --> 00:18:20,169
more of a preservation like I like this

425
00:18:18,849 --> 00:18:22,179
the way it is and I want it to stay that

426
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:23,560
way I don't want it to change I don't

427
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:26,380
want it to butter up I want everything

428
00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:27,009
to stay the same boom into the fridge or

429
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:29,710
the freezer

430
00:18:27,009 --> 00:18:32,349
that's preserving hearing on the other

431
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:34,630
hand is something that you can do in

432
00:18:32,349 --> 00:18:40,259
different environments so dark

433
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:43,810
environments cold environments different

434
00:18:40,259 --> 00:18:45,400
textures and and like substances to

435
00:18:43,809 --> 00:18:47,289
cover the hash in some people put it

436
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:49,240
away in glass some people put it away

437
00:18:47,289 --> 00:18:51,399
and like a humidor type thing on screen

438
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:53,740
some people there's such a variety of

439
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:55,960
ways to put hash you're going to have to

440
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:57,339
find the best way for you well the

441
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,630
freeze dryer is something a little

442
00:18:57,339 --> 00:19:00,519
different right you'll notice that if

443
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:02,470
you dry your hash naturally using a

444
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:04,569
desiccant like the pizza box cardboard

445
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:08,140
technique that I've shown that the hash

446
00:19:04,569 --> 00:19:10,389
will cure differently than if you suck

447
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:12,190
with a vacuum the moisture content out

448
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:14,650
of the wax membrane so you can do that

449
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:16,360
as well but you'll notice differences

450
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:18,190
and those differences are so subtle and

451
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:19,469
so small that I couldn't really explain

452
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:21,580
to you exactly what they are

453
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:23,140
particularly because you might be using

454
00:19:21,579 --> 00:19:24,159
different cultivars in different

455
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:26,500
environments it's set

456
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:29,080
etc but I will say that the freeze dryer

457
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:31,869
I told Tony when we got the freeze

458
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:34,509
dryers that I would still want to have

459
00:19:31,869 --> 00:19:36,250
hash that is done the old-school way so

460
00:19:34,509 --> 00:19:38,799
we have because they're sort of like

461
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:41,170
different products any time you mess

462
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:43,089
with the terpene content of the of the

463
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:45,550
plant you're going to be affecting the

464
00:19:43,089 --> 00:19:50,619
modulation and therefore the effects of

465
00:19:45,549 --> 00:19:52,839
that plant and so yeah it's curing is a

466
00:19:50,619 --> 00:19:54,759
tricky one I have that 10 year old hash

467
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:57,009
I have I have it in wood I have it in

468
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:58,660
glass I have it out in the open I have

469
00:19:57,009 --> 00:20:00,400
some in the fridge I have some in a

470
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:03,490
colder environment and I have some at

471
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:07,390
room temperature yeah there's a whole

472
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:09,549
bunch of different ways who you trying

473
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:12,580
to be I don't know who I'm trying to be

474
00:20:09,549 --> 00:20:14,289
man I think just me I think just me you

475
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:18,220
know it's the only person I know how to

476
00:20:14,289 --> 00:20:20,170
be really I prefer it to I'll it's a

477
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:22,900
it's like psychedelic experience being

478
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:25,269
me which I'm sure it's like that to be

479
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:27,370
you as well how long bubbleman product

480
00:20:25,269 --> 00:20:30,549
being cured well it really depends angel

481
00:20:27,369 --> 00:20:32,889
you know the cute the the cure in my

482
00:20:30,549 --> 00:20:36,460
opinion more importantly happens along

483
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:38,860
the line of properly you know desiccant

484
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:40,299
room to a little colder than room

485
00:20:38,859 --> 00:20:43,469
temperature once you get into the

486
00:20:40,299 --> 00:20:46,359
science of extracting and and with

487
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:48,250
laboratory grade freeze dryers then

488
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:50,829
you're getting into a perspective that

489
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:53,200
sure you can cure the hash as long as

490
00:20:50,829 --> 00:20:55,779
you want but the effects aren't really

491
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:58,870
going to be you know what I noticed with

492
00:20:55,779 --> 00:21:00,220
the majority of hash that hits the

493
00:20:58,869 --> 00:21:03,159
marketplace especially in places like

494
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:05,740
California just sounded like a stone

495
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:09,490
what was that stone stone mr. Rogers

496
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:11,079
right I like that sorry I've got a small

497
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:13,599
little when I turned my phone sideways I

498
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:15,099
only get a couple of lines of text so I

499
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:17,049
really have to read everything you guys

500
00:21:15,099 --> 00:21:19,719
are saying and trust me I'm reading at

501
00:21:17,049 --> 00:21:20,919
all while I'm talking to you yeah what's

502
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:23,110
the longest you have cured hash ten

503
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:26,560
years ten years is my oldest hash right

504
00:21:23,109 --> 00:21:28,119
now and yeah can you talk about the new

505
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:30,700
terpene syrup I can tell you this much

506
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:33,069
okay it is really really

507
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:35,620
interesting I've never had such an

508
00:21:33,069 --> 00:21:37,869
experience I mean it's really

509
00:21:35,619 --> 00:21:39,309
Tony's I got to give my hats off to the

510
00:21:37,869 --> 00:21:41,529
guy because he's changing the game you

511
00:21:39,309 --> 00:21:43,869
know the idea first of all how high I

512
00:21:41,529 --> 00:21:45,460
got off of it was incredible it and I

513
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:47,319
dabbed like twenty or thirty minutes

514
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:49,059
earlier so I wasn't expecting to feel

515
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:50,859
anything even though I'm well aware of

516
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:52,839
the modulating effects of terpenes I

517
00:21:50,859 --> 00:21:54,449
always kind of understood that they

518
00:21:52,839 --> 00:21:57,639
would happen together simultaneously

519
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:59,799
instantaneously and when he put he said

520
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:01,840
put a mil of the syrup in the water I

521
00:21:59,799 --> 00:22:03,460
put it in i watched it dissipate I'll

522
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:05,799
show you guys I'll make a video I

523
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:09,100
watched it dissipate into these long

524
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:12,399
strands that kind of vibrated and and

525
00:22:09,099 --> 00:22:15,369
just dispersed into this cloud and then

526
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:17,440
disappeared I also put in some of the

527
00:22:15,369 --> 00:22:19,179
xylitol which is like his Terp sugar

528
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:23,230
it's not sugar at xylitol it's a

529
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:25,360
sweetener and it's pretty sweet like

530
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:27,400
it's nice and it's Jack Frost that he

531
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:28,899
sent me and some oh gee 18 so I put in

532
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,940
the Jack Frost I put a little of the

533
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:33,250
syrup in I drank half this glass of

534
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:35,380
water it was really tasty you know light

535
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:37,240
light but like to a connoisseur

536
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:39,070
especially someone say that had that

537
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:41,200
cultivar that just took a dab of it then

538
00:22:39,069 --> 00:22:44,379
to be given that water I could really

539
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:47,319
see it being used as a pairing in a dab

540
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:49,900
bar I could really see it transferring

541
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:51,819
over the whole differences of the vibes

542
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:53,530
of hanging out and getting super high

543
00:22:51,819 --> 00:22:55,990
versus people hanging out in drinking

544
00:22:53,529 --> 00:22:58,359
alcohol socially I loved the idea of

545
00:22:55,990 --> 00:23:00,370
creating a more social aspect of

546
00:22:58,359 --> 00:23:02,319
cannabis use with large amounts of

547
00:23:00,369 --> 00:23:04,809
people I noticed when I go to certain

548
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:06,819
events like cannabis cups people are

549
00:23:04,809 --> 00:23:08,980
smoking concentrates and they don't have

550
00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:10,720
the same ability to articulate and stay

551
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:12,759
awake and their zombied out there just

552
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,950
like kind of like this and there's a lot

553
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:17,109
of them and I love the idea of getting

554
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:20,140
together with people and smoking a lot

555
00:23:17,109 --> 00:23:22,629
and medicating but not to fall asleep I

556
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:24,610
love the idea of micro doses of dabs

557
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:26,980
with the terpenes in conjunction with

558
00:23:24,609 --> 00:23:29,319
the terpene water it's a really Spacey

559
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:31,720
almost psychedelic headspace that you

560
00:23:29,319 --> 00:23:32,950
get into and it keeps you awake and it

561
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,509
doesn't burn you out and it doesn't make

562
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:36,819
you want to go to sleep and I'm telling

563
00:23:34,509 --> 00:23:38,680
you I not that I'm against lounges where

564
00:23:36,819 --> 00:23:40,299
people just go and get annihilated and

565
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,060
fall asleep I'm not saying get rid of

566
00:23:40,299 --> 00:23:43,159
those okay

567
00:23:41,059 --> 00:23:45,440
I'm not fighting against anything that

568
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:46,970
already exists I'm fighting for more so

569
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:52,610
I just see the day where we could get

570
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:55,190
into more of that social aspect and and

571
00:23:52,609 --> 00:23:57,049
really help at the same time people move

572
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:58,940
away slowly from alcohol use because I

573
00:23:57,049 --> 00:24:01,639
know when people use cannabis even in

574
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:05,330
micro micro amounts they tend to drink

575
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:06,860
less be cool to have in bars at great

576
00:24:05,329 --> 00:24:08,599
concerts you know where you could go and

577
00:24:06,859 --> 00:24:11,449
get a pairing terpene water a little

578
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:13,250
vapor hit you have hash and the

579
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,660
dispensaries around don't offer it to my

580
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:16,039
knowledge yeah it's a tough one dude

581
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:17,810
that's awesome sounds so nice can't wait

582
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:18,980
to see that being put out in bulk funny

583
00:24:17,809 --> 00:24:21,049
I've never noticed anything like that

584
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:23,029
not into sleeping lounges I prefer

585
00:24:21,049 --> 00:24:23,419
energy filter cafes that's what I'm

586
00:24:23,029 --> 00:24:25,730
saying

587
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:27,230
Peter I'm not into sleeping lounges

588
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:29,420
either I don't get tired it doesn't make

589
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:32,240
me want to go to sleep so I get really

590
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:35,720
excited and no-neck Lutz I don't smoke

591
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:38,480
Chemical extracted resins so people

592
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:40,730
using butane and propane and hexane it's

593
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,470
pretty pretty standard most people know

594
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:47,839
that I don't use those products at all

595
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:49,910
my whole thing is I am promoting solvent

596
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:52,519
lists methods of extraction chemical

597
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:54,769
solvents you know ones that come from

598
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:56,450
petrochemical factories not the chemical

599
00:24:54,769 --> 00:24:58,549
solvents that are naturally occurring in

600
00:24:56,450 --> 00:25:01,340
cannabis again oh don't be sorry bro

601
00:24:58,549 --> 00:25:03,169
don't be sorry it gets tricky when we

602
00:25:01,339 --> 00:25:04,759
talk about it and I hear Tony be like oh

603
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:07,340
we're doing solvent list it's like well

604
00:25:04,759 --> 00:25:09,740
you know terpenes our solvents they are

605
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:12,139
hydrocarbons so that's not solvent list

606
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:14,509
it's not solvent free it's like there's

607
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:16,370
solvents in all of our cannabis extracts

608
00:25:14,509 --> 00:25:18,589
what I'm trying to say is I'm not

609
00:25:16,369 --> 00:25:20,359
talking about the beautiful hydrocarbon

610
00:25:18,589 --> 00:25:24,709
solvents that cannabis produces I'm

611
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:28,799
talking about the petrochemical extracts

612
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:31,990
that multi-national conglomerate

613
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:34,659
corporations are sucking out of the

614
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:36,579
earth and poisoning the world with so

615
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:38,170
that's really what I'm trying maybe we

616
00:25:36,579 --> 00:25:40,389
just say poisons that's a good way to

617
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:42,550
say it Shawn's Shawn's oh you know

618
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:44,320
poison free it might be a little harsh

619
00:25:42,549 --> 00:25:46,750
but it's the truth you know we don't

620
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:48,579
want to you know Tony and I are coming

621
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:51,220
from a perspective where we're trying to

622
00:25:48,579 --> 00:25:54,369
be the most conscious and because of it

623
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:57,190
I can promise you this that as the the

624
00:25:54,369 --> 00:25:58,959
higher the integrity is the lower the

625
00:25:57,190 --> 00:26:00,670
profits will be that's why we're trying

626
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,740
to come in at a low dollar we're trying

627
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:05,500
to wholesale these products out for not

628
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:07,690
insane dollars so they end up as $200

629
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:09,279
grams we want to keep them under $100

630
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:11,259
and you know these [ __ ] are

631
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:12,940
doubling their money so if you can come

632
00:26:11,259 --> 00:26:15,369
in between thirty and forty five dollars

633
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:17,920
a gram for really beautiful product and

634
00:26:15,369 --> 00:26:19,959
hey I'd love to see it get cheaper love

635
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:21,880
to see it get cheaper if we could grow

636
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:24,160
it cheaper if we could grow acres of

637
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:26,800
this [ __ ] we could I do not smoke weed

638
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:28,450
Fuli not for 15 years but I do have an

639
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:30,639
appreciation for it because all of the

640
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:32,529
hashish comes from the weed and of

641
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,720
course the fibers and the cellulose and

642
00:26:32,529 --> 00:26:36,910
the essential amino acid rich seed

643
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:39,250
embryos everything about it is wonderful

644
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:44,279
I wear it I eat it I smoke it I put it

645
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:47,140
on my skin and yeah it's a good thing

646
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:49,119
yeah well I hope so too NIC Lutz I do

647
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:50,800
hope so too we've got a bunch of cool

648
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:52,359
things on the horizon I haven't been

649
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:55,659
talking about too much I don't like to

650
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:58,059
get into the full-blown shameless

651
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:59,950
plugging of brands but you guys can go

652
00:26:58,059 --> 00:27:01,569
check out bubble man brand that on

653
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:03,400
Instagram and that's that's the best way

654
00:27:01,569 --> 00:27:05,829

on the boat

658
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:17,690
what about rosin prices yeah what about

659
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:20,509
rosin prices a lot of work can go into

660
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:21,798
rosin prices that's why it depends on if

661
00:27:20,509 --> 00:27:23,239
you're first making hash and then

662
00:27:21,798 --> 00:27:28,269
squishing the hash and turning it into

663
00:27:23,239 --> 00:27:28,269
rosin I get seasick too man

664
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:41,538
[Music]

669
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:08,120
press the mute Oh weird where the hell

670
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:10,309

671
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:12,409
tripped me out sorry guys yes there was

672
00:28:10,309 --> 00:28:14,450
a pot of killer whales here last year we

673
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:17,360
saw there's been many dolphins humpback

674
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:18,860
whales blue whales it's pretty cool

675
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:20,779
actually the amount of wildlife that

676
00:28:18,859 --> 00:28:22,549
comes in here yeah it must have been the

677
00:28:20,779 --> 00:28:24,589
edge of my hand but I try very hard not

678
00:28:22,549 --> 00:28:26,119
to touch the bottom or the top of the

679
00:28:24,589 --> 00:28:27,619
phone these phones look so similar I

680
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:32,199
can't tell which ones which when I'm on

681
00:28:27,619 --> 00:28:35,599
these on these shows there's the Lions

682
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:39,529
there they are look they're in my hand

683
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:42,619
I'm holding that mountain it is so calm

684
00:28:39,529 --> 00:28:44,329
Indra what is your expected return when

685
00:28:42,619 --> 00:28:46,519
sifting good material we'll sift is the

686
00:28:44,329 --> 00:28:48,710
only a particular type of heads only a

687
00:28:46,519 --> 00:28:50,329
particular size of heads so it's not

688
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:52,610
like you're getting everything sift

689
00:28:50,329 --> 00:28:55,699
isn't about getting everything the magic

690
00:28:52,609 --> 00:28:58,219
about sift is getting specific heads

691
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:59,870
trying to get it all is awesome at the

692
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:02,420
end if you want to make medicine but I

693
00:28:59,869 --> 00:29:05,119
always tell people first let's get out

694
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:06,740
the best the ones that will blow your

695
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:08,479
mind and that's what Sam was doing when

696
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:10,370
I first met him his you know of course

697
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,720
he had bred his cultivars from seeds he

698
00:29:10,369 --> 00:29:13,699
had collected from hash producing

699
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:15,799
countries around the world bred those

700
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:19,309
seeds grew those seeds processed that

701
00:29:15,799 --> 00:29:21,710
resin it was perfection on all accounts

702
00:29:19,309 --> 00:29:24,220
oh yes happy fourth of July to all my

703
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:25,880
American friends happy fourth of July

704
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:28,819
that's awesome

705
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:33,110
so it's all about really pulling out Sam

706
00:29:28,819 --> 00:29:35,779
would brag about getting 1% so I was

707
00:29:33,109 --> 00:29:38,029
always like yeesh 1% that's not enough

708
00:29:35,779 --> 00:29:40,069
so sift in my opinion is something that

709
00:29:38,029 --> 00:29:41,720
you do and then afterwards you're going

710
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:43,789
to want to take the material and do

711
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:47,990
something else with because you are not

712
00:29:43,789 --> 00:29:49,490
getting everything how did Sam be able

713
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:51,410
to become legally to do all the work he

714
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:53,029
did well FSS you know what when he got

715
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:54,440
into trouble in Santa Cruz he left

716
00:29:53,029 --> 00:29:55,490
California knowing that he was just

717
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,750
going to continue to get in trouble

718
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:59,150
because he wasn't gonna stop what he was

719
00:29:56,750 --> 00:30:01,519
doing and he thought the best idea for

720
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:03,200
him to do would be to kind of go in

721
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:05,298
under a pharmaceutical come

722
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,490
or a nutraceutical company under that

723
00:30:05,298 --> 00:30:09,558
model and apply for licensing and

724
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:13,370
permits exactly how those companies do

725
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:16,190
and put CEOs in in place for you know to

726
00:30:13,369 --> 00:30:18,500
shake hands and sign documents and he

727
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:22,038
basically did some great work I mean the

728
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:24,319
guy bred some incredible cannabis when I

729
00:30:22,038 --> 00:30:26,720
first went to Holland in 95 and all the

730
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:30,019
herb was skunk number one in the coffee

731
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:32,298
shops that was all Dave's and not grown

732
00:30:30,019 --> 00:30:33,919
by him or profited by him but taken the

733
00:30:32,298 --> 00:30:36,200
clones from his greenhouse through

734
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:41,990
workers or whatever and and you know

735
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:43,580
passed on to everyone and Voula

736
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:44,659
you're kind of a character yeah skunk

737
00:30:43,579 --> 00:30:47,418
what am I talking about I'm talking

for him yeah you know he's done some

746
00:31:05,179 --> 00:31:10,610

749
00:31:12,619 --> 00:31:17,058
trying to get it going on yeah Andrew

750
00:31:14,659 --> 00:31:20,289
you can catch all sorts of fish here a

751
00:31:17,058 --> 00:31:22,548
lot of people from China and Vietnam

752
00:31:20,288 --> 00:31:26,480
Asian countries

753
00:31:22,548 --> 00:31:29,480
come along the the rocks and and just

754
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:31,849
fish for rock fish very popular amongst

755
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:33,919
those cultures and then everyone pretty

756
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:36,230

760
00:31:43,669 --> 00:31:48,559
years ago yeah dude we have an amazing

761
00:31:46,579 --> 00:31:50,599
Asian culture here in Vancouver and

762
00:31:48,558 --> 00:31:52,369
because of it I get to enjoy many many

763
00:31:50,599 --> 00:31:56,119
aspects of their culture food being

764
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:59,329
probably the number one I do love me

765
00:31:56,119 --> 00:32:01,638
some some some food like whether it's

766
00:31:59,329 --> 00:32:04,519
from Thailand whether it's from India

767
00:32:01,638 --> 00:32:07,819
whether it's from China whether I just

768
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:09,710
really love all of those types of foods

769
00:32:07,819 --> 00:32:12,799
Indian maybe one of my favorites

770
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:15,069
actually really spicy wicked hot Indian

771
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:17,450
food love that [ __ ]

772
00:32:15,069 --> 00:32:19,309
Bank rivers Chinatown yeah dude we have

773
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:22,360
an amazing Chinatown we have an amazing

774
00:32:19,309 --> 00:32:25,309
you know NorCal nugget I'm sure we have

775
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:27,619
we do have a Filipino community for sure

776
00:32:25,309 --> 00:32:30,319
I grew up in Winnipeg and we had a huge

777
00:32:27,619 --> 00:32:33,559
filipino community I had some great

778
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:36,169
great times kind of gaining access to

779
00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:38,750
that community as a kid back in back in

780
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:41,900
Winnipeg someone is over fished that

781
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:46,130
killer whales can't produce young well

782
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:48,470
Alex you know salmon spawns every year

783
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:50,060
like millions and millions of them there

784
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:51,740
every four years actually but there's

785
00:32:50,059 --> 00:32:54,919
different spawns that happen this pink

786
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:58,250
spawn that's coming right now was four

787
00:32:54,920 --> 00:33:02,930
years ago four years ago it was the

788
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:04,519
highest spawn of salmon since 1918 so

789
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:07,160
that goes against what you're saying in

790
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:09,710
the sense that it was more than we've

791
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:11,720
seen in over a hundred years so I think

792
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:13,850
sometimes there are cycles that we don't

793
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:15,799
understand on the planet and I get that

794
00:33:13,849 --> 00:33:17,869
we're doing damage and we're doing all

795
00:33:15,799 --> 00:33:20,000
sorts of shitty things but I think the

796
00:33:17,869 --> 00:33:22,669
world has ways of balancing itself out

797
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,619
and when I sometimes think that if our

798
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:27,140
history was allowed to go back further

799
00:33:24,619 --> 00:33:29,089
than this this 2,000 years I think it's

800
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:30,620
a big part of the manipulation if we had

801
00:33:29,089 --> 00:33:31,970
history that went back twenty or thirty

802
00:33:30,619 --> 00:33:34,189
or forty thousand years and we're

803
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:36,230
allowed to actually know that history we

804
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:39,220
would see these larger cycles at work

805
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:41,269
for instance people are often you know

806
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:43,009
obviously we're bummed out when we hear

807
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:44,750
about a new animal species making it

808
00:33:43,009 --> 00:33:46,579
onto the endangered list

809
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:49,549
and even more bummed out when they

810
00:33:46,579 --> 00:33:53,689
become extinct but how about this for a

811
00:33:49,549 --> 00:33:56,059
thought probably 95 plus percent of the

812
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:59,420
life that's lived on this planet is

813
00:33:56,059 --> 00:34:01,099
extinct so it's kind of trippy it's like

814
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:03,140
this evolution right we're just

815
00:34:01,099 --> 00:34:06,230
completely evolving and you know the

816
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:09,079
olds goes to the way just like the cycle

817
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:10,730
of life so I try to keep a positive vibe

818
00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:12,650
on it I used to get really bummed out

819
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:14,599
and go deep into conspiracy and the

820
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:16,430
agenda and all the crazy harsh [ __ ] that

821
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:18,079
was happening in the world and then I

822
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:19,980
kind of felt like maybe that was part of

823
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:22,289
their agenda like they wanted me to

824
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:23,639
you know like why am i sharing negative

825
00:34:22,289 --> 00:34:25,469
information when I could be sharing

826
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:27,269
positive information why do people when

827
00:34:25,469 --> 00:34:29,158
they pull out their phones do they want

828
00:34:27,269 --> 00:34:31,980
to say oh you got to see what Donald

829
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:33,990
Trump tweeted or what Ted Cruz said it

830
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:35,699
was just so stupid it's like why do you

831
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:37,168
want me to be bummed out and listen to

832
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:39,000
something so stupid like why don't you

833
00:34:37,168 --> 00:34:40,618
bring me a knowledge bomb like why don't

834
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,329
you say hey dude listen to this you're

835
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:44,579
gonna be blown away it's Alan Watts and

836
00:34:42,329 --> 00:34:47,190
he's talking about the the you know what

837
00:34:44,579 --> 00:34:49,608
is the meaning of life and the fabric of

838
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:52,530
the universe that's what I want to be

839
00:34:49,608 --> 00:34:54,090
getting turned on to yeah Sean so I mean

840
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:55,530
my goodness what the hell are we

841
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:58,350
thinking guys and we're all guilty of it

842
00:34:55,530 --> 00:35:00,240
on some level or another sharing bad

843
00:34:58,349 --> 00:35:04,319
information with people whether it's

844
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:06,509
politics or propaganda or bunk in any

845
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,430
way shape or form it's keeping you from

846
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:11,430
doing good work it's keeping you from

847
00:35:08,429 --> 00:35:14,989
sharing good information exactly terence

848
00:35:11,429 --> 00:35:18,029
mckenna ralph abraham Rupert Sheldrake

849
00:35:14,989 --> 00:35:20,159
just to name a few Erik Kay Drexler

850
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:23,010
wrote a wonderful book called engines of

851
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:25,440
creations and recently radical abundance

852
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:27,270
about nanotechnology though that's

853
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:29,490
interesting stuff you know there's a lot

854
00:35:27,269 --> 00:35:32,849
of fun stuff out there science has no

855
00:35:29,489 --> 00:35:36,599
agenda other than truth and more so than

856
00:35:32,849 --> 00:35:40,079
truth is too you know uncover this truth

857
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:41,400
to uncover lies and so yeah Jason Silva

858
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:44,009
is great he's got some really

859
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:46,470
inspirational kind of two three minute

860
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:48,000
videos that you can go check out very

861
00:35:46,469 --> 00:35:50,939
much you know I put him in line with

862
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,429
sort of a Terrence and Alan Watts you

863
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:59,490
know philosophical deeply intelligent

864
00:35:53,429 --> 00:36:02,159
and very able to articulate his his

865
00:35:59,489 --> 00:36:04,259
information in and just in a real

866
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:06,679
positive manner it's inspiring actually

867
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:09,080
it's quite inspiring

868
00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:10,909
albeit chalice he says all right Marcus

869
00:36:09,079 --> 00:36:12,259
we may be at chalice Toni's gonna try

870
00:36:10,909 --> 00:36:17,329
and get down there we're not sure for

871
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:19,880
sure but we'll see what happens 5:01

872
00:36:17,329 --> 00:36:22,340
cajones I'm humbled that you say that I

873
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:25,160
don't feel that I am but I guess that's

874
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:28,250
kind of those are my inspirations so

875
00:36:25,159 --> 00:36:29,690
it's best if I could do them justice and

876
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:31,159
really it's all about just sharing

877
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:32,539
information that's what we're all here

878
00:36:31,159 --> 00:36:33,920
doing that's why we have all these

879
00:36:32,539 --> 00:36:35,809
phones we're trying to connect we're

880
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:38,420
trying to learn we're trying to you know

881
00:36:35,809 --> 00:36:40,519
and I will say this right now Oh have I

882
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:45,590
read a behold a pale horse come on I

883
00:36:40,519 --> 00:36:47,869
read that book in 1990 or 1980 even 1989

884
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:49,490
behold a pale horse was sort of how it

885
00:36:47,869 --> 00:36:51,559
all started that in Robert Anton Wilson

886
00:36:49,489 --> 00:36:54,439
I read the Illuminati's trilogy in

887
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:56,000
Schrodinger's cat and what are the the

888
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:58,070
part one and two three oh cosmic

889
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,539
triggers I read all those and then I

890
00:36:58,070 --> 00:37:01,190
eventually got into Terence and I

891
00:36:59,539 --> 00:37:03,500
started listening to his lectures and I

892
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:05,389
started reading all his books I read

893
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:07,550
archaic revival and food of the gods and

894
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:10,250
true hallucinations trial logs at the

895
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:12,530
edge of the West pretty much all of them

896
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:14,630
very inspired by those guys I ordered

897
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:17,000
spores from Terence from his company and

898
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:19,700
in Hawaii called Sidney that he had with

899
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,349
his wife Kath at the time and I grew

900
00:37:19,699 --> 00:37:23,359
those spores and I passed those

901
00:37:21,349 --> 00:37:25,880
psychedelic mushrooms out to many many

902
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:28,220
many many people and I felt like it was

903
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:30,320
really good work it was like fighting

904
00:37:28,219 --> 00:37:32,480
the demons it was like this tool that

905
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:33,980
you could take bring into a place like

906
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:36,050
Winnipeg where people are suffering from

907
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:38,119
alcoholism and pharmaceutical addiction

908
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:40,340
and bring this psychedelic mushroom into

909
00:37:38,119 --> 00:37:41,599
my community and with the information

910
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:43,519
that we had which was like we're not

911
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:45,860
partying man we're going and taking five

912
00:37:43,519 --> 00:37:47,840
ground dried grams in a darkroom we're

913
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:49,940
blowing our ego right out the backdoor

914
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:52,039
to remove that discomfort which will

915
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:53,780
follow you through a trip if you try to

916
00:37:52,039 --> 00:37:57,110
hold on to your ego you really have to

917
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:59,000
let go of your ego if you do try octo

918
00:37:57,110 --> 00:38:00,950
Tom I would urge you to have very good

919
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,809
friends with you potentially one at

920
00:38:00,949 --> 00:38:04,730
least that's a watcher who's not

921
00:38:02,809 --> 00:38:06,289
involved in the psychedelic journey that

922
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:07,969
can take care of you guys make sure

923
00:38:06,289 --> 00:38:10,309
you're in a safe environment you don't

924
00:38:07,969 --> 00:38:11,959
want to be around glass or certain

925
00:38:10,309 --> 00:38:13,789
things that if you start flailing around

926
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:16,220
or moving in a way that might not be

927
00:38:13,789 --> 00:38:17,960
conducive to being around those those

928
00:38:16,219 --> 00:38:20,089
types of things it's important to think

929
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,480
about first also it's good to look into

930
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:22,430
your

931
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,570
certain things are going to upset your

932
00:38:22,429 --> 00:38:26,509
stomach if you take psychedelics

933
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:28,190
afterwards and that could upset your ego

934
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:30,800
and if you don't take enough to blow

935
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:35,570
your ego out you're gonna have this real

936
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:36,980
intense vibe well you know what they say

937
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:39,470
about tryptamines is that our body

938
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:41,210
recognize them recognizes them so for

939
00:38:39,469 --> 00:38:44,439
safety aspects you know certain

940
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:47,329
psychedelics take 9 to 10 hours to

941
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:49,519
dissolve you know to be removed from the

942
00:38:47,329 --> 00:38:52,340
body to be broken down so they are no

943
00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:54,469
longer psychedelic things like LSD the

944
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:56,660
body doesn't quite recognize that form

945
00:38:54,469 --> 00:38:58,759
of the molecule but in in tryptamine

946
00:38:56,659 --> 00:39:00,889
form in the pure tryptamine form it can

947
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:02,770
be five minutes long not that that

948
00:39:00,889 --> 00:39:05,119
should give you a feeling of safety

949
00:39:02,769 --> 00:39:07,130
because truly that five minutes you

950
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:09,469
could live a thousand lifetimes and die

951
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:11,990
a thousand deaths so I don't know if I

952
00:39:09,469 --> 00:39:13,809
would say it's safe but it's an inward

953
00:39:11,989 --> 00:39:16,459
journey that each person has to take

954
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:18,139
some people wouldn't say that it's safe

955
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:19,760
to change their entire lives and when

956
00:39:18,139 --> 00:39:21,920
you go in and you have these perspective

957
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:23,780
changes a lot can change in a real quick

958
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,820
hurry I feel blessed to have done them

959
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:28,670
as a young man and to have been able to

960
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:31,340
shape myself before I became in my 40s

961
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:36,200
you know throughout my late teens 20s

962
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:38,150
and 30s I was able to really get get

963
00:39:36,199 --> 00:39:40,609
close and intimate with psychedelics

964
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:42,619
particularly mushrooms mushrooms along

965
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:44,630
with potentiate errs met mao inhibitors

966
00:39:42,619 --> 00:39:47,750
like harmine and harmaline that are

967
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:50,450
present in banisteriopsis in all forms

968
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:52,690
we were using the route and of course

969
00:39:50,449 --> 00:39:55,539
Syrian rule which can be purchased at

970
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:58,340
Iranian or middle-eastern grocery stores

971
00:39:55,539 --> 00:40:02,210
edible ones so they don't have poisons

972
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:04,400
sprayed on them and yeah just a little

973
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:06,230
bit of Syrian rule with some psychedelic

974
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:08,660
mushrooms will produce an ayahuasca like

975
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:10,250
effect where you have the tryptamine

976
00:40:08,659 --> 00:40:11,839
aspect from the psilocybin and the

977
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:13,460
sillas in' and you have the mao

978
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:16,280
inhibitors the harming and the harm

979
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:17,780
alene from the whatever source you're

980
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:21,920
using the syrian roof seeds or the

981
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:23,780
banisteriopsis caapi Oh how's that going

982
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:27,740
drew micro doses of dimethyltryptamine

983
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:29,150
rips do we have to ban Lully I could

984
00:40:27,739 --> 00:40:30,439
just get rid of them I mean I kind of

985
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:32,869
wanted to leave them because I felt like

986
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:34,019
maybe he was learning but you know what

987
00:40:32,869 --> 00:40:36,750
when a respected member

988
00:40:34,019 --> 00:40:38,460
of the of the of the group here asks

989
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:40,380
that someone be banned I'm gonna respect

990
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:42,090
that I know you guys aren't just trying

991
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:44,430
to ban people for no good reasons I

992
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:46,350
think I banned him yeah he was kind of

993
00:40:44,429 --> 00:40:48,179
like he's kind of seemed like a troll

994
00:40:46,349 --> 00:40:50,940
but I've had these kind of you know like

995
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:52,199
not really like he might be learning you

996
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:53,730
know what I mean a few times I would

997
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:56,000
reply to him and instead of trolling

998
00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:57,960
back he'd be like oh okay that's cool so

999
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,489
anyway I think we dropped some pretty

1000
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:01,829
good knowledge today I think the boat is

1001
00:40:59,489 --> 00:41:03,689
very conducive to getting me to talk I

1002
00:41:01,829 --> 00:41:05,279
think we're gonna be doing a lot of

1003
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:07,409
these boat wake-and-bake so I will try

1004
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:09,690
to bring guests we have a lot of seats

1005
00:41:07,409 --> 00:41:11,730
here it would be nice who would I

1006
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:14,130
recommend for Sullivant 'less companies

1007
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:17,730
in Canada I would check out in Ontario

1008
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:20,849
glacial melts here in Vancouver you can

1009
00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:23,309
check out west coast concentrates I

1010
00:41:20,849 --> 00:41:26,909

1011
00:41:23,309 --> 00:41:29,789

don't use derogatory terms that's

1028
00:42:12,389 --> 00:42:19,519
negative that's mean it's hateful and

1030
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:24,269
your division and I understand the value

1031
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:26,220
of life is our splices where we come

1032
