I've watched every episode of 1.0 and

65
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:54,439

66
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:56,719
times so yeah um this is the it's it's

67

71
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:10,919
quite honored to be honest and I'm very

72
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:13,560
excited you know the the time spent not

73
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:15,119
seeing people during this pandemic um

74
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,280
has been hard for everyone and so this

75
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,400
for me this is kind of my first time

76
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,759
getting out and um I think it will be

77
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,599
for a lot of folks and so it's just

78
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:24,479
going to come with a lot of excitement a

79
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:27,959
lot of good

80
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:30,919
feelings and um you

81
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:31,959
know pretty cool deal and so yeah we're

82
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:33,318
going to invite some of the other

83
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:35,640
speakers on and we're just going to kind

84
00:03:33,318 --> 00:03:37,919
of wrap it up you know about what we do

85
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:40,199
what the show is um like marker said I

86
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:43,438
put it on it's it's kind of a an intense

87
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:45,959
show but also uh lowkey in the same way

88
00:03:43,438 --> 00:03:49,239
um we don't hype it up there's not any

89
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:52,158
sponsorships or tables or boothing or

90
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:53,959
things being sold albeit we you know

91
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:56,078
some people might sell some seeds uh

92
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:58,438
here and there but it's nothing it's not

93
00:03:56,079 --> 00:04:00,519
a show it's not a profit driven thing um

94
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:02,359
some of the speakers do have

95
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:04,319
products or brands that they they are

96
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:07,079
associated with um but we ask them not

97
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:08,958
to not to pump them up and to really be

98
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:11,799
about education and

99
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,039
so it kind of the tickets are 450 bucks

100
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:15,640
and I always feel really bad because

101
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:17,680
it's a chunk of money but uh in reality

102
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:19,759
it it is such a value and and that you

103
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,879
are paying for the speakers to be there

104
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,600
and to interact with these speakers um

105
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:25,360
and so today you'll get a little taste

106
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,160
of of some of the the quality of of

107
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,439
folks we have um it's like I said it's

108
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,039
quite humbling for me to get to spend

109
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:33,240
time with each each and every one of

110
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:35,918

118
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,639
you know a vital part of the the the

119
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,199

support um yeah so it's you know it's

122
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:04,639
it's a real heady crew and and you know

123
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,759
they I asked them to uh spend time there

124
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,199
they don't just come up and do their

125
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,000
lecture and bounce out they're they I

126

get them two two Hotel nights and so two

127
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,639
or three Hotel nights sometimes the

128
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,680
whole thing if if they want to stay and

129
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:18,360
so you'll be able to smoke it up with

130
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,879
with Eric and with Kevin for sure and

131
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,160
and they'll be around and you can chop

132
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:23,478
it up with these guys and get real

133
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:25,120
connection and and and and it ends up

134
00:05:23,478 --> 00:05:26,959
going beyond that for most folks you

135
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,759
know I there's a lot of folks in our

136
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:30,560
community that I I'm in contact with at

137
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:31,919
least that that have come to these

138
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,120

139
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:36,318
connections and started businesses and

142
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:43,159

143
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:45,079

the rest of the tour it's going to be

166
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:43,839
cool so really stoked to have you here

167
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:46,039
bro dude I love I love what you just

168
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:48,159
said and it was very reminiscent of hash

169
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:49,759
church where you were kind of like and I

170
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,800
didn't know this about the conference to

171
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,598
be to be honest about how it's not

172
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:56,079
really like don't come and promote

173
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:58,439
yourself overly come and just promote

174
00:06:56,079 --> 00:07:00,159
your knowledge and I absolutely love

175
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:01,918
that and I I get that

176
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,720
you know the way the World Turns and the

177
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:05,560
way we hustle and we make our money is

178
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,599
by promoting ourselves selling our

179
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,439
products and doing all of that there

180
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:11,759
really is something to say about

181
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:13,800
maintaining the Integrity of the

182
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,319
information I've always felt the same

183
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:19,639
way about hash Church um you know to not

184
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:21,879
monetize it um specifically because I

185
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:23,400
felt like it would affect the Integrity

186
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:25,479
of the information that we were sharing

187
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:27,519
and the minute you put that filter of

188
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:29,159
kind of monetization sometimes that

189
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:31,359
people are you know I mean we just did

190
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:33,160
it with pass church this uh last month

191
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,759
in in Los Angeles it was the first one

192
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,960
we ever threw where we allowed some

193
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:38,560
sponsorships and we kind of we changed

194
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:40,318
it up a little bit just trying to grow

195
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,918
it a little bit but I I gotta say man I

196
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:45,400
appreciate that about your conference

197
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:48,878
that is uh that's on point thanks man

198
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:50,279
yeah it you know I it's not that I don't

199
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,759
I'm not trying to make money you know

200
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:54,478
but I want to do that in other ways and

201
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,080
So like um I feel that and I feel that

202
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:57,439
you know other speakers can speak for

203
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:59,758
themselves but I feel like folks have

204
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:01,319
got recognition in this that is kind of

205
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,319
let them make money in their own

206
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:05,960
sideways you know and it's it's if

207
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:08,360
anything it's just been a validation of

208
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:10,318
uh to the community you know so I'm

209
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:12,439
really grateful that that I I can do it

210
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,439
and be a part of it and you know and

211
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:16,199
actually people buy my seeds because of

212
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:18,879
the exposure so it's it's a blessing

213
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:18,879
that way too you

214
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:25,680
know I'm having minor technical

215
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,439
difficulties I see on YouTube the link

216
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,400

217
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:33,719

while so uh why don't you just tell us

234

235
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:22,359
years is that weird sure no

236
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:24,919
cool um uh yeah no I mean uh I have it's

237
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,879
been a whirlwind I I I haven't caught up

238
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:28,679
with a lot of people um everybody

239
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:30,120
everybody's been pretty busy one way or

240
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:33,120
the other and

241
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:35,159
the last um you know year or two I guess

242
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,959
with the the way the world's been going

243
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:40,199
it's been harder to connect in some

244
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:42,159
cases but nevertheless um after leaving

245
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,959
the greenhouse company three years ago I

246
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:46,120
started my own company called Greenhouse

247
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:48,919
Advisory Group and I just been

248
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:52,200
Consulting um I took a little job with a

249
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:54,199
Distribution Company the gate um doing

250
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:56,399
procurement just to try to kind of keep

251
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:59,800
some keep some things going while I was

252
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:01,559
starting my uh my you know my company

253
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:03,559
and uh I did that for like a year and a

254
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:05,679
half running around the hills of humble

255
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:08,000
actually sleeping in tents and trying to

256
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:10,039
find trim and flower and stuff for the

257
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,600
distribution companies and it was

258
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:14,078
actually super fun but it was pretty

259
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,560
hardcore at the same time and then uh

260
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:19,639
March of 2020 my consulting company

261
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:23,359
really took off and uh I've been busy

262
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:26,039
ever since and and uh um it's been cool

263
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,879
you know I mean uh I I I don't work in

264
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:29,319
California as much anymore I think

265
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:30,879
because of the market tanking and

266
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,320
certain things that people are laying

267
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:35,078
people off more than they're hiring

268
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,560
anyone so um I've kind of been fortunate

269
00:10:35,078 --> 00:10:39,559
to stay busy in some other states and

270
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:42,039
and learning a lot along the way I I

271
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:44,559
gotta say that you know as much as I'm

272
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:46,360
there to help I feel like I'm I'm I'm

273
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:50,518
getting to learn so much at the same

274
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:50,519
time that it's pretty rewarding on that

275
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:59,720
part you're muted are you

276
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,399
muted oh I was going to say maybe on

277
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:03,079
that note what's maybe an interesting

278
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:04,720
grow or technique that you've come

279
00:11:03,078 --> 00:11:07,559
across that you weren't you weren't

280
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,560
seeing you know

281
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,240
Cali uh you know I mean that's a good

282
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,320
question the techniques are all over the

283
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,159
place you kind of see that even in Cali

284
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,399
I mean it's hard to go to one farm and

285
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:20,278
them doing exactly the same thing I mean

286
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,919
everybody does something a little bit

287
00:11:20,278 --> 00:11:25,078
different uh but what I would say that

288
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:28,120
I'd see difference in other states than

289
00:11:25,078 --> 00:11:31,039
I see in Cali is the equipment like the

290
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:32,720
the bells and whistles or the the fancy

291
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:35,278
stuff that people throw at these green

292
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,759
houses and I think in some cases it's

293
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:39,879
because the price of cannabis is worth

294
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:41,879
more in other states so the price the

295
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:45,159
cost of production I guess can be more

296
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:46,679
and so the the willingness to throw more

297
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:49,278
equipment and stuff at these green

298
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:51,199
houses is increased and so it doesn't

299
00:11:49,278 --> 00:11:53,559
necessarily in my opinion make them run

300
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,040
better or better green houses in a lot

301
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:57,119
of ways they can kind of be a little bit

302
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:59,679
more of a headache but man I've seen

303
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,919
more crazy fancy equipment and

304
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:03,838
dehumidifiers and certain things that I

305
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:06,919
haven't seen in California before

306
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,839
because uh people decided to go I guess

307
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:11,120
crazy in some of these other

308
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:13,160
states are you enjoying that because

309
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,879
like when I first kind of tuned into you

310
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:16,159
you were the guy who was saying like not

311
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:18,198
let's knock some of this equipment out

312
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:20,120
of here and try to use natural air flow

313
00:12:18,198 --> 00:12:23,278
and be wise about this you know the

314
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:25,078
environment we're in and um I me how do

315
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:26,759
you feel about all is are are you

316
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:29,319
welcoming the technology a little bit or

317
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:31,319
you still kind of cutting some of it out

318
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,839
well it's it's it's one of those things

319
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:35,639
where you know when I show up it's

320
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:37,600
either I try to bring you know you know

321
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:39,680
uh earn the paycheck or bring the value

322
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,600
that I can by trying to make things work

323
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:43,039
rather than you know saying none of this

324
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,759
is going to work and this is the way I

325
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:47,639
would do things or whatever I try to

326
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:49,399
incorporate what I like and understand

327
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:52,360
and what I believe works best with

328
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:54,000
whatever system there is and um you know

329
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:56,919
at the end of the day sometimes trying

330
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,480
to dial in these things and and and work

331
00:12:56,919 --> 00:13:00,159
with what they got has been the

332
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,839
challenge for me to kind of learn about

333
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:04,439
all these things and then how to make it

334
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:06,880
work right because again I come from the

335
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,760
idea of supportive environments a lot of

336
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:10,240
people have this controlled environment

337
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:11,720
that they still carry around everybody

338
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,959
wants a controlled environment a

339
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:16,120
controlled environment and I still don't

340
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:19,518
see green houses as being as controlled

341
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:21,120
of an of an environment as as say an

342
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:25,039
indoor you know an indoor is a little

343
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:26,959
bit more controllable um 365 247 but

344
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:28,360
when it comes to green houses I mean

345
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:30,000
shoot in the middle of the summer it

346
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,680
gets really hot not all of them cool

347
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,639
down like you want them to and so green

348
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:35,439
houses really are more of a controlled

349
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:37,278
environment in my opinion in the winter

350
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,240
time and the summer comes and yeah you

351
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:40,838
have all these pieces of the puzzle but

352
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:43,440
how do you create the best support

353
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:45,079
system because in my mind the control

354
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,519
thing really kind of goes out the window

355
00:13:45,078 --> 00:13:48,799
because there's really not any control

356
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:51,360
it's like getting these systems to do

357
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:53,198
the best they can to reach the closest

358
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,278
to the parameters that we want which

359
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:58,240
isn't really control it's like you know

360
00:13:56,278 --> 00:13:59,879
hopes and dreams and like I said if you

361
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,919
don't have the right support system in

362
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:04,278
there all that control stuff doesn't

363
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:07,319
necessarily work and then dialing it all

364
00:14:04,278 --> 00:14:09,600
in to make it work together is another

365
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:11,839
difficult part so for me it's fun I like

366
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,399
go wow what is this place gonna have

367
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:15,040
here you know and the next Greenhouse

368
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:17,198
wow what is this place gonna have here

369
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:19,360
and a lot of times I wonder who signed

370
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:22,000
off on this [ __ ] and how is there no

371
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:25,519
liability for some of these companies I

372
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:29,559
don't know but um it's definitely eye

373
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:32,120
opening so um all the different growth

374
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:33,958
Styles Greenhouse indoor you know

375
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:36,278
growing controlled Greenhouse in the

376
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:37,879
winter uh what what are you setting up

377
00:14:36,278 --> 00:14:39,799
if you have an unlimited budget for a

378
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:42,838
personal

379
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:45,240
grow well I mean my personal grow I mean

380
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:47,639
I like beds so I mean you know organic

381
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,639
living

382
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:55,199
soil you know if you were going into the

383
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:57,838
commercial space what I've been learning

384
00:14:55,198 --> 00:15:00,639
and and working with at scale is more of

385
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:02,680
the um grow that do an organic approach

386
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:05,720
with dosatrons and like three gallon

387
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:07,479
pots and so you know at scale one of the

388
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:09,720
reasons that people kind of start to shy

389
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:12,440
away from the Organics is yeah one the

390
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:14,560
cost but two is the delivery system and

391
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:17,920
the ability to not have clogged emitters

392
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:17,919
and and

393
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:26,360
and well so it's been a real fine line

394
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:28,480
to find the right you know uh products

395
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:30,800
and and stuff to to work into these

396
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,759
systems and so I've I've seen a lot of

397
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:35,439
good things with a couple special

398
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:38,959
Farmers with you know three gallon pots

399
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:40,600
on a really good organic system um that

400
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:42,439
I don't see everywhere else and it's

401
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,480
starting to work and and I'm starting to

402
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:46,480
notice its scalability and things like

403
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,680
that and so with my travels and all

404
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:51,519
these big farms and all this other stuff

405
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:53,919
it's surprising a lot of people strive

406
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:56,959
or wish for Organics but it really comes

407
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:59,120
down to sometimes a the cost and B the

408
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:01,879
deliverability of everything and to make

409
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,399
it work right um consistently and so

410
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:05,039
some of the farmers that I've seen being

411
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:06,958
able to pull that off lately have been

412
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:09,000
in the game for like 25 years and

413
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:11,119
they've done everything under the sun

414
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,839
and they've kind of come to this place

415
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,720
and I'm like all over it going whoa what

416
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:16,240
are we doing here like I want you know I

417
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,399
want to check this out a little bit

418
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,360
because it's really hard to take a salt

419
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,519
farm and convert them to beds but it's

420
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:24,440
easier to take their two or three gallon

421
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:28,480
pots and start to trickle in some type

422
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:30,639
of an organic uh approach or even trial

423
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:33,560
to have them do so that they can sort it

424
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:35,839
out and see if it's worth you know U

425
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:35,838
going

426
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,560
into what up

planes Lots you you have a client and

the Ohio fact you got two things going

441
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:27,199
yeah yeah you want to tell us about the

442
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:29,319
the Ohio fire Factory yeah sure so um a

443
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:32,320
year a year and a half ago or so some of

444
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:34,079
my my old Marine brothers and I I'm a

445
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:37,480
Marine Corps veteran for those of you

446
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:40,000
that didn't know um and we get together

447
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:41,519
every year and have a reunion uh and

448
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,000
just kind of hang out and shoot the [ __ ]

449
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:48,639
and catch up and a couple of my brothers

450
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,279
had expressed interest this was right

451
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:55,000
during the 2019 season when I was doing

452
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:56,558
the 100 Acre uh hemp hemp grow and was

453
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,279
talking to them about it was very

454
00:17:56,558 --> 00:18:03,519
excited and also had um the stuff going

455
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:06,359
on in seram and so uh they had kind of

456
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:08,679
expressed interest in you know doing

457
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:11,399
something together and you know I I just

458
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:13,840
kind of laughed it off as a you know oh

459
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:15,880
that would be really cool you know but

460
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:19,038
it'll never happen type of situation and

461
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:21,679
then as we kept talking it the the idea

462
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:25,200
really started to uh consolidate and

463
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:27,480
condense into reality and before we know

464
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:30,440
it we were actually you know putting

465
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:33,480
plans together to do to an indoor

466
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:36,600
facility um there in Ohio one of my

467
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:38,519
partners owns owns the building outright

468
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:40,839
and had a whole half of the building

469
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:43,158
that was kind of being leased to

470
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:45,599
somebody else and he was like I'll kick

471
00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:48,159
them out and let's do this thing you

472
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:50,558
know and so you know it it slowly became

473
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:53,360
a reality and um we're in the middle of

474
00:18:50,558 --> 00:18:55,000
our first cycle of our first phase of a

475
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:57,279
buildout it's eventually going to be

476
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:01,319
about a 100 lighter um we're it's going

477
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:02,558
to be all indoor and um you know just

478
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:04,519
cultivating the way I've been

479
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:08,599
cultivating over the years with just

480
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:11,720
very minimal inputs um focusing on Dr

481
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:14,319
laning M's kind of soil food web

482
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:16,919
biologically complete compost as being

483
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:20,119
the the main uh vehicle that kind of

484
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:22,360
drives our fertility um that's kind of

485
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:23,759
what I want to be talking about too U

486
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:25,918
unfortunately I really wish I could have

487
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:28,158
made it to the humble I was just uh

488
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:31,320
priorly committed that weekend and it

489
00:19:28,159 --> 00:19:32,960
was it was there was no budge there so

490
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:34,678
um I'm really bummed because I know a

491
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,240
lot of a lot of my friends and

492
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:39,080
colleagues are going to be at the

493
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:42,079
Humbolt uh get together

494
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:44,918
but uh it it the other three I'm I'm

495
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:46,199
open and available for so that's that's

496
00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:47,880
really kind of one of the things that I

497
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:51,640
wanted to talk about was just to share

498
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:53,000
my experience and what I've learned from

499
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:55,120
the last time because I haven't been

500
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,558
very active on YouTube I pretty much

501
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:59,558
just don't do anything on YouTube

502
00:19:56,558 --> 00:20:02,558
anymore so I haven't been

503
00:19:59,558 --> 00:20:04,639
um as as much of an open book as I have

504
00:20:02,558 --> 00:20:06,000
in the past with what's going on with me

505
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,280
and so I think this is a really good

506
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,759
opportunity to share what I've learned

507
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:14,960
over the years um what I picked up from

508
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:17,558
Dr ela's Foundation course material um

509
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:21,159
how that changed my perspective in

510
00:20:17,558 --> 00:20:23,279
regards to uh chemistry and fertility H

511
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:26,400
you know as related to you know and how

512
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:29,119
how much more important biology is in

513
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,640
that um in that scenario than CH istry

514
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:33,558
necessarily so and we and there's some

515
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:37,679
interesting anecdotal evidence that we

516
00:20:33,558 --> 00:20:39,279
had found from our 2019 grow and um

517
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:42,759
we're going to be pushing forward in

518
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:45,759
this indoor living soil space with a

519
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:50,000
with a heavy focus on biology being the

520
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:51,599
main driving uh uh factor to uh the

521
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,960
plant's fertility and so we're going to

522
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:57,079
try to we're going to document that with

523
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:59,960
uh chemistry analysis and and plant sap

524
00:20:57,079 --> 00:21:02,558
and tissue analysis as well as the

525
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:05,840
biological U monitoring and Analysis as

526
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:08,440
well and just hopefully in a few years

527
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:12,278
we'll have a lot of uh really good data

528
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:14,640
to to to present and to and to discuss

529
00:21:12,278 --> 00:21:17,558
um you know along the veins doing in

530
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:20,038
cannabis kind of what John Kemp is doing

531
00:21:17,558 --> 00:21:22,440
in main a and big a you know they've got

532
00:21:20,038 --> 00:21:24,558
some really interesting data um that's

533
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:27,440
been that's repeatable you know that

534
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:29,519
points to say a soybean field they're

535
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,840
they're taking a chemistry analysis of

536
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:35,240
the of the soil before planting and

537
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:38,798
let's say there's in this arbitrary 130

538
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:42,400
units or 120 units of nitrogen available

539
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:44,879
um they plant their uh soybeans or or

540
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,919
whatever their crop is and the crop uses

541
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,440
130 units of nitrogen and then they

542
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:51,919
retest at the end of the year and the

543
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:55,080
soil has the same 120 units of nitrogen

544
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:57,960
that it had to begin with and and so if

545
00:21:55,079 --> 00:22:00,240
we think about biology and our our soil

546
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:03,640
and our parent material as kind of an

547
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:06,319
inexhaustible resource and a mine for

548
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:09,320
the NPK and Trace that kind of any crop

549
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:11,798
needs um then we can really start having

550
00:22:09,319 --> 00:22:14,599
uh um discussions about the importance

551
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:17,480
of biology and that interaction with the

552
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:19,759
plant so that's that's kind of what I'm

553
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:21,798
hoping to have a discussion with folks

554
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:23,879
when we don't dude I mean every time I

555
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:25,798
pop on your your lives on Instagram

556
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:27,880
you're doing some cool experiments I

557
00:22:25,798 --> 00:22:31,240
watched compost through the spring and

558
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:33,520
summer last year and um at the Ohio fire

559
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:35,679
Factory are you taking the same approach

560
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:37,558
as in like a a water kind of only

561
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:40,798
approach where you're compost base no

562
00:22:37,558 --> 00:22:43,599
compost teas oh well extracts compost

563
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:45,679
extract so we're not gonna the only time

564
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:47,719
we would do the the actual brood tea

565
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:49,759
would be if we were doing a foler

566
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:53,000
application and right now that's just

567
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:55,278
kind of not in our regimen at you know

568
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,159
like we're really keeping to that very

569
00:22:55,278 --> 00:23:00,960
simple simplistic approach we do have a

570
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:04,840
very simple kind of IPM regimen you know

571
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:08,440
that's a kelp and Alo foler with uh you

572
00:23:04,839 --> 00:23:10,918
know um entics or really kind of like in

573
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:12,919
the mountain organic stuff you know uh

574
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:15,880
uh it's a really nice product that's

575
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:18,520
kind of pre-formulated um and works

576
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:20,760
works for us but yeah everything is

577
00:23:18,519 --> 00:23:23,319
going to be very much um the same kind

578
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:25,200
of water only approach um any kind of

579
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:27,879
biology addition that's going to happen

580
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:32,000
will happen in between Cycles so once

581
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:34,159
cash CR is in um nothing but water uh is

582
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,480
is the ultimate goal you know I think in

583
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:38,480
this first cycle first and second cycle

584
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:41,798
we are going to be doing some compost

585
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:43,679
extracts mid cycle just because it's the

586
00:23:41,798 --> 00:23:45,759
biology isn't at the levels that we

587
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,400
would we would necessarily want right

588
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:49,879
off the bat so we're just trying to

589
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:51,600
Kickstart those um the the biggest

590
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:54,679
problem is is if you're not making your

591
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:57,199
own compost you're pretty much buying a

592
00:23:54,679 --> 00:24:00,000
A reduced waste compost which is not

593
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:02,000
going to have a lot of that uh a lot of

594
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,519
the protozoa and the things that you

595
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,200
need to really kind of cycle nutrients

596
00:24:04,519 --> 00:24:08,798
and mine those nutrients from your

597
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:11,960
parent material in your soil so we're

598
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:14,599
implementing our own composting program

599
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:16,038
at firef factory and anybody that I talk

600
00:24:14,599 --> 00:24:18,599
to or work with I really kind of

601
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:20,720
encourage encouraging them to you know

602
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:23,278
Implement these kind of composting

603
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:26,120
programs in place um that are really

604
00:24:23,278 --> 00:24:29,119
going to afford you the ability to um

605
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:31,839
you know uh generate your own um biology

606
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:34,000
reserves that you can use on at your

607
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:37,798
facility or your hom growth are you

608
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,519
doing the composting indoors as well um

609
00:24:37,798 --> 00:24:40,798
no not not necessarily I think what

610
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:42,240
we're going to do at fire Factory is

611
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:45,000
we're going to just build a little kind

612
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,919
of a pole barn uh type uh open

613
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,278
open-sided po barn and we're going to do

614
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:52,278
the bulk of our composting in the spring

615
00:24:50,278 --> 00:24:54,200
and summer and then store it through the

616
00:24:52,278 --> 00:24:57,000
winter so so we're just going to kind of

617
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:58,880
do Mad Dash when it's nice warm and not

618
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,880
have to deal with the cold as as you can

619
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,919
imagine Ohio is pretty chilly um and I'm

620
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:07,399
I'm not interested in in composting

621
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:08,679
indoors necessarily so I think uh we're

622
00:25:07,398 --> 00:25:11,639
we're just going to we have plenty of

623
00:25:08,679 --> 00:25:14,440
space outside of the facility to um

624
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:15,720
there's even like a big concrete slab um

625
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:17,440
that we're going to end up using because

626
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:19,759
we're pretty close to a river and I know

627
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:22,360
that the EPA gets a little funny when

628
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:24,038
you start composting their water sources

629
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:26,240
so we're fortunate we've got the slab to

630
00:25:24,038 --> 00:25:28,558
work on and uh we're just going to kind

631
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,079
of Leverage that

632
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:32,480
so you said you're you're going to build

633
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:35,278
up to 100 lights um what's your first

634
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:38,200
phase right now what size is it a 20 uh

635
00:25:35,278 --> 00:25:41,159
right now we're at 28 lights uh so yeah

636
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:42,759
28 lights 14 beds and uh that's the the

637
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:44,840
most recent pictures you've seen if

638
00:25:42,759 --> 00:25:47,960
you've seen on Instagram that's kind of

639
00:25:44,839 --> 00:25:50,278
where we're at um in my typical fashion

640
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:51,720
we kind of overgrew it a little bit um

641
00:25:50,278 --> 00:25:53,440
but I I've only been able to be there

642
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:56,200
one week out of the month and my two

643
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:58,000
partners have zero cultivation

644
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:00,679
experience and when I say zero I mean

645
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,319
[ __ ] zero one of them's an electrician

646
00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:06,480
by trade owns his own you know business

647
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:08,480
contractor and the other guy is a runs a

648
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,679
very successful kind of finished

649
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,319
carpentry business where he goes in and

650
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:14,840
and does the finished carpentry for

651
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:19,398
hospitals and vas and I mean he's booked

652
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:22,038
out till 2026 the guy's a a whiz and

653
00:26:19,398 --> 00:26:25,479
really a really great micromanager so a

654
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:27,919
I've really found over the years to find

655
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:31,079
people in your what the talents are in

656
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:32,520
the in your team and even if they're

657
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:34,278
kind of conflicting with your

658
00:26:32,519 --> 00:26:36,319
personality like I am not a

659
00:26:34,278 --> 00:26:38,960
micromanager I mean I'm the furthest

660
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:40,960
thing from a micromanager but you kind

661
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,798
of need somebody on the team who has

662
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:45,440
those skills who has that attention to

663
00:26:42,798 --> 00:26:48,440
detail um to to really kind of push the

664
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:50,519
projects through and so he's been a a a

665
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:52,640
huge benefit in that regard and I've

666
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:53,798
really learned a lot from him in the

667
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,278
little bit of time that we've been

668
00:26:53,798 --> 00:26:58,398
working together um you know in this

669
00:26:56,278 --> 00:27:00,599
capacity I we've known each other for

670
00:26:58,398 --> 00:27:02,918
years but you really don't really know

671
00:27:00,599 --> 00:27:04,959
somebody until you you move in together

672
00:27:02,919 --> 00:27:09,120
or start start a business together you

673
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:11,120
know it's pretty true yeah well you got

674
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:12,558
you you guys served together so you had

675
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:14,199
you know that's maybe a little bit more

676
00:27:12,558 --> 00:27:16,240
than you you would have with a normal

677
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:18,080
friend yeah because we can cut we can

678
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,558
cut through the [ __ ] you know like

679
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:20,918
you know there's always going to be

680
00:27:19,558 --> 00:27:22,759
times where there's a there's a

681
00:27:20,919 --> 00:27:24,679
potential headbutting situation or you

682
00:27:22,759 --> 00:27:26,839
have kind of conflicting ideologies on

683
00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:29,000
how to approach things and the fact that

684
00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:31,319
we have this kind of this together where

685
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,278
we can we're really comfortable like

686
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:35,558
family calling each other out or being

687
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:37,119
like hey that's [ __ ] stupid you know

688
00:27:35,558 --> 00:27:38,639
I don't agree with that or I don't

689
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:40,319
understand and we don't really let

690
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:43,559
feelings get in the way which which

691
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:45,359
helps a lot um at at kind of keeping

692
00:27:43,558 --> 00:27:49,079
keeping things moving forward and not

693
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:51,798
stagnating um communication in the team

694
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:55,918
um or lack thereof is what can make or

695
00:27:51,798 --> 00:27:59,200
break a business in in in most

696
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:01,120

you want to share with folks real

730
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:26,120
briefly what you're up to [ __ ] um yeah

731
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:29,079
you know I've been doing a lot of

732
00:29:26,119 --> 00:29:30,639
different work the it's funny be like on

733
00:29:29,079 --> 00:29:33,278
the regen group I'm I'm the least

734
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,720
qualified to be on the panel but when

735
00:29:33,278 --> 00:29:37,558
it's when it comes time to hustle and

736
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:40,640
move my feet that's something I can do

737
00:29:37,558 --> 00:29:42,558
well and what I've been working on is

738
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,240
really Global work I mean I'm in I'm in

739
00:29:42,558 --> 00:29:46,079
I think five different countries right

740
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:49,679
now so I have operations in five

741
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:53,798
countries that I'm owner of so I I went

742
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:56,519
Global in cannabis because California

743
00:29:53,798 --> 00:29:58,599
Cannabis is such a [ __ ] disaster that

744
00:29:56,519 --> 00:30:01,399
I didn't want to die in it

745
00:29:58,599 --> 00:30:03,319
mentally you you you can't struggle

746
00:30:01,398 --> 00:30:05,319
indef and I'm someone who likes struggle

747
00:30:03,319 --> 00:30:08,918
but you can't struggle indefinitely

748
00:30:05,319 --> 00:30:11,678
without diminishing your energy and you

749
00:30:08,919 --> 00:30:14,480
end up getting bitter and burned out and

750
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:16,759
so what I did is I started just trying

751
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:20,240
to understand better like how do I keep

752
00:30:16,759 --> 00:30:22,359
myself mentally fresh and it's it's

753
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,399
really allowing yourself to go and work

754
00:30:22,359 --> 00:30:28,119
all over the planet where there's things

755
00:30:24,398 --> 00:30:29,639
that are possible and so I I've been

756
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:32,278
hell excited about that because it's

757
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:34,640
awesome to work globally and what I

758
00:30:32,278 --> 00:30:36,839
worked on locally you know like in homeo

759
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:39,640
was we we worked really on trying to

760
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:42,720
drive attention to the Appalachian

761
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:46,200
program and uh regenerative type

762
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:48,720
Agriculture and so I came up with a a

763
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:50,000
concept that uh I was able to work with

764
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,399
cookies on where I said hey we should

765
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,000
cover humble appellations we should

766
00:30:52,398 --> 00:30:57,158
bring in this information I wrote The

767
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:01,079
Press we laid out the piece and we just

768
00:30:57,159 --> 00:31:02,799
broke 5 million views this week so 5

769
00:31:01,079 --> 00:31:06,038
million views on a 30-minute video is

770
00:31:02,798 --> 00:31:08,759
not bad so what I know is my marketing

771
00:31:06,038 --> 00:31:10,278
is on point and and that's what I've

772
00:31:08,759 --> 00:31:12,519
been working on is really trying to

773
00:31:10,278 --> 00:31:16,000
drive awareness and attention to the

774
00:31:12,519 --> 00:31:18,679
people who do the work because that's

775
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,919
not where they shine they shine in what

776
00:31:18,679 --> 00:31:22,679
they do which is regenerative a which is

777
00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:25,278
really extremely time and labor

778
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:28,840
intensive so it doesn't allow you the

779
00:31:25,278 --> 00:31:31,079
opportunity to do all the other stuff

780
00:31:28,839 --> 00:31:33,678
and we worked on the development of the

781
00:31:31,079 --> 00:31:35,599
ganier so uh the ganier I came up with

782
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:38,080
like eight years ago I sold it to green

783
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:40,439
flower and it's been an incredible

784
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:42,638
program and it it's the same situation

785
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:45,080
it's how do you drive attention to craft

786
00:31:42,638 --> 00:31:46,678
producers and it's not even just craft

787
00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:49,720
producers it's all producers because I

788
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:52,200
don't have a beef with big

789
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:54,278
operations you if you don't like big

790
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:56,960
operations tell me you [ __ ] walk to

791
00:31:54,278 --> 00:31:59,079
work every day and I I'll listen to you

792
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:02,798
but if you jump in a car then I don't

793
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:06,398
want to hear your [ __ ] so it's really

794
00:32:02,798 --> 00:32:09,278
about trying to to do the best job you

795
00:32:06,398 --> 00:32:11,678
can and to bring attention to cannabis

796
00:32:09,278 --> 00:32:13,960
and cultivation in general it's not just

797
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:15,639
for little it's for all because what

798
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:17,558
happens is when you start to polarize

799
00:32:15,638 --> 00:32:20,759
the conversation especially in the

800
00:32:17,558 --> 00:32:23,440
United States anytime you point at

801
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:26,240
someone being not good or you're

802
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:29,120
complaining Americans look at it like

803
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:31,638
you're a loser and so what happens is

804
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:33,439
it's the opposite effect the more you

805
00:32:31,638 --> 00:32:34,959
cry about getting the [ __ ] kicked out of

806
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,200
you the more people believe you get the

807
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,880
[ __ ] kicked out of you and so for me I

808
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:41,120
don't play that game you never [ __ ]

809
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,480
see me cry or set a goddamn tear since

810
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:46,278
you've known me because I know where I'm

811
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:48,919
from I know that no one gives a [ __ ]

812
00:32:46,278 --> 00:32:52,159
what we have to do is is highlight the

813
00:32:48,919 --> 00:32:55,759
positive and what you have to do is is

814
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:58,360
is get people enthused and caught up in

815
00:32:55,759 --> 00:33:01,879
what we do which is really the beauty of

816
00:32:58,359 --> 00:33:03,719
agricultural appreciation at any level

817
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:05,440
and so that's what I've been really

818
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:08,880
working on I mean I work on Business

819
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:11,519
Development around the world but in my

820
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:14,600
area it's strictly been to drive

821
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:16,278
attention to the craft situation by

822
00:33:14,599 --> 00:33:18,519
using humbal so we brought all the

823
00:33:16,278 --> 00:33:21,038
ganier into humbal County so Humbolt is

824
00:33:18,519 --> 00:33:23,159
where all the education happens which is

825
00:33:21,038 --> 00:33:24,558
a [ __ ] inconvenience for everyone

826
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:27,240
really because it's you know it's it's

827
00:33:24,558 --> 00:33:29,278
up the hill but what it does it allows

828
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:31,200
the students to come in it lets me

829
00:33:29,278 --> 00:33:33,960
introduce them to craft cultivators in

830
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,960
the area it lets them Tor Craft Farms

831
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:37,278
and the impact has been excellent on a

832
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:39,399
lot of these Farmers because we've been

833
00:33:37,278 --> 00:33:40,960
able to highlight their product and all

834
00:33:39,398 --> 00:33:42,879
of a sudden when all your product sells

835
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:45,840
out you're kind of enthused about the

836
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:48,679
program and so what you have is Buy in

837
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:50,720
when there's results and and that's

838
00:33:48,679 --> 00:33:53,559
really all I care about I mean [ __ ] I'm

839
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:55,360
55 years old I've been I've been I've

840
00:33:53,558 --> 00:33:57,918
been in the game My Whole Life what I

841
00:33:55,359 --> 00:33:59,439
want to see is posit positive stuff com

842
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:04,360
forward or otherwise what we end up

843
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:07,159
having is just a a decimation of

844
00:34:04,359 --> 00:34:09,639
agricultural appreciation by virtue of

845
00:34:07,159 --> 00:34:12,480
the fact that you you can't get any type

846
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:14,399
of traction in sales and so when it

847
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,918
comes right down to it man it's really

848
00:34:14,398 --> 00:34:18,638
can you sell the flow you make and and

849
00:34:16,918 --> 00:34:21,039
how do you get people to be aware of it

850
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:22,200
and how do you drive that information

851
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:24,358
and that that's really what I've been

852
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:27,239
doing I mean I got so much [ __ ] going on

853
00:34:24,358 --> 00:34:28,319
you know me I'm [ __ ] never sto moving

854
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:30,279
but that's

855
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:32,399
what I'm trying to do can you explain

856
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:34,720
the ganier program a little bit more

857
00:34:32,398 --> 00:34:37,118
because um I think it's I didn't

858
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:38,638
understand it first and you know I now

859
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:40,440
what I Now understand I think it's

860
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:43,000
really cool and it has the potential to

861
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:44,599
really help us all move our product you

862
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,159
know and in the way that you guys are

863
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:49,159
developing the students to come out and

864
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:50,480
do the grading system and kind of create

865
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:53,320
a scale can you explain that a little

866
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:56,000
bit Yeah the the the basis of the ganier

867
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:58,079
was really common language and so the

868
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,400
problem is that we all used different

869
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:03,560
terminology it's like the the the the

870
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:05,119
the biblical Babel where uh everyone's

871
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:08,960
talking a different language and no one

872
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:11,838
has any ability to to make any type of

873
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:14,440
progress and so with the ganier it was

874
00:35:11,838 --> 00:35:17,400
really trying to determine how does one

875
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:18,960
teach people how to evaluate cannabis

876
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:21,320
and then how do you give them some

877
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:23,440
historical background on cannabis so

878
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:27,039
they can understand really where we came

879
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:29,720
from we we're really stealing everything

880
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:31,559
we know from from the past right and so

881
00:35:29,719 --> 00:35:34,159
how do you take some of that information

882
00:35:31,559 --> 00:35:35,759
and and bring it into the current and

883
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:37,199
then how do you teach people how to look

884
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,839
at cannabis and and give him an

885
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:42,399
evaluation process that is pretty

886
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:44,679
[ __ ] thorough and so the beauty of

887
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,760
the ganier was that it wasn't one person

888
00:35:44,679 --> 00:35:49,078
I think there was like 18 of us that got

889
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:52,400
together and I want to say we spent

890
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:55,000
almost like 7,000 man hours combined

891
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:58,318
over a two-year period to create it the

892
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:00,440
the arguments the wars over what we were

893
00:35:58,318 --> 00:36:02,519
looking at and what's graded and what's

894
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:05,039
noted and what's important and what's

895
00:36:02,519 --> 00:36:07,639
the weight it was hysterical because all

896
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:10,000
of us were care so we're blasting on

897
00:36:07,639 --> 00:36:11,719
each other constantly to determine

898
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,318
what's really something that we can

899
00:36:11,719 --> 00:36:17,000
agree on that we believe is valid and

900
00:36:15,318 --> 00:36:20,358
what it did is it gave us a really

901
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:22,440
really thorough evaluation process which

902
00:36:20,358 --> 00:36:26,239
allows you to be able to compare apples

903
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:29,240
to apples and my goal was was to it was

904
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:32,000
to identify the best which I always know

905
00:36:29,239 --> 00:36:34,439
comes out of craft and to identify the

906
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,079
value which comes out of commercial

907
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:38,358
because the commercial operation should

908
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:39,960
be able to sell at a cheaper price point

909
00:36:38,358 --> 00:36:42,039
and those two are the only two points I

910
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:44,480
really care about the what's the what's

911
00:36:42,039 --> 00:36:46,199
the best quality flower and what's the

912
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:49,318
stuff that's affordable for people who

913
00:36:46,199 --> 00:36:51,879
don't have the budget so the masses need

914
00:36:49,318 --> 00:36:54,440
to know where the value is and those

915
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:56,200
that want to experience really premium

916
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:58,400
cannabis need to know how do you how do

917
00:36:56,199 --> 00:37:02,358
you come to that conclusion

918
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:04,280
and so it's been uh a fantastic

919
00:37:02,358 --> 00:37:07,318
experience

920
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:10,640
because the the industry is in such

921
00:37:07,318 --> 00:37:14,239
disarray but the students have such hope

922
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:16,480
for their future that it's infectious

923
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:19,719
and so when you when you get to be an

924
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:22,800
instructor to help people work on their

925
00:37:19,719 --> 00:37:24,439
goals of moving into this new industry

926
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:28,519
not So Much from the old industry but

927
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:32,920
the new industry and they're trying to

928
00:37:28,519 --> 00:37:35,838
bring such a a heartfelt Drive oh [ __ ]

929
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:38,039
it couldn't be a better time you know

930
00:37:35,838 --> 00:37:39,639
and the diversity of it's incredible and

931
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:42,800
the part that I I'll be honest the part

932
00:37:39,639 --> 00:37:44,719
I like most is that the we have probably

933
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:47,039
right now with ganier graduates I bet

934
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:50,838
there's almost $2.8 billion dollar in

935
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:53,199
flower sold under ganier graduate lead

936
00:37:50,838 --> 00:37:56,159
buyers so some of the largest msos in

937
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:57,960
the country are graduates of the program

938
00:37:56,159 --> 00:37:59,759
and what that means is that those people

939
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:01,079
who graduated that program and now

940
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,200
pretty [ __ ] aware of what good

941
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:05,640
quality is and when you're controlling

942
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:08,358
$2.8 billion dollar in total sales in

943
00:38:05,639 --> 00:38:10,039
the United States because I added it all

944
00:38:08,358 --> 00:38:11,838
up myself I just said like all you

945
00:38:10,039 --> 00:38:14,079
people are these heads of these massive

946
00:38:11,838 --> 00:38:17,880
companies and what it does it allows

947
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:22,880
them to be able to start bringing

948
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:24,920
forth a uh smaller cultivators smaller

949
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,680
producers and highlight them because

950
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:28,000
they know that is the upper shelf they

951
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:30,199
learned to that

952
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,800
at the meeting what we're able to do is

953
00:38:30,199 --> 00:38:33,480
we're able to bring these people into

954
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:35,480
the building but we're able to bring in

955
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:37,039
because it's local I can bring in local

956
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,679
farmers so season needs to get your ass

957
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:40,719
over there we got to get you in the room

958
00:38:38,679 --> 00:38:42,679
season I'd love to have you come by and

959
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:44,078
meet the students it'd be awesome

960
00:38:42,679 --> 00:38:45,960
because that's what I do is I just bring

961
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:47,760
locals in that can speak to them and

962
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:49,920
then we bring in all kinds of weird herb

963
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:52,160
that no one's ever consumed [ __ ] that's

964
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:54,519
not on the market stuff that we like to

965
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:57,000
[ __ ] around with and so it lets people

966
00:38:54,519 --> 00:38:59,440
really get to experience the fringes of

967
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,679
cannabis in a way they normally don't

968
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:05,400
and it allows them to see the bigger

969
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:07,759
picture and they also get to get the the

970
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:09,000
emotional connection to the cultivators

971
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:12,599
because they get to meet them they get

972
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:14,559
to travel to the farms and it starts to

973
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:18,079
personalize that

974
00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:21,000
sale and so to me you know the ganier

975
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:23,680
isn't it's it's it's about cannabis

976
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:26,440
evaluation appreciation but for me it's

977
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:28,118
always about move that [ __ ] weed

978
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:31,119
because if you're not moving it we all

979
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:32,440
going broke and and I used to get these

980
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:34,000
people used to bust my balls where they

981
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:35,480
would talk about I'm on the regen

982
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,280
conference but they would say that I

983
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:39,519
should be doing my own genitor

984
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:42,319
conference because it's it's what I

985
00:39:39,519 --> 00:39:44,280
focus on so much but I'm like listen you

986
00:39:42,318 --> 00:39:46,639
you want to work you know doing what you

987
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:49,240
do you do what you do but in cannabis we

988
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:51,759
need to have intelligent marketing and

989
00:39:49,239 --> 00:39:54,118
we need to have a a higher level

990
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:56,319
understanding of what makes quality and

991
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:58,240
that has to be able to be easily

992
00:39:56,318 --> 00:40:01,199
explained

993
00:39:58,239 --> 00:40:04,719
and driven forward in a way that doesn't

994
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:07,000
go they're bad we're good it's it's not

995
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:08,959
about you or ey it's about the product

996
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,079
the product has to stand on its own and

997
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,720
we know that it can it just needs to be

998
00:40:11,079 --> 00:40:15,160
highlighted and I think the ganier is

999
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:17,519
doing an excellent job with it and I

1000
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:20,318
think that the quality of the student

1001
00:40:17,519 --> 00:40:21,480
that came through the program I was you

1002
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:22,599
know how it is you're going to deal with

1003
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,039
a couple hundred people in your

1004
00:40:22,599 --> 00:40:26,720
educational program there's going to be

1005
00:40:24,039 --> 00:40:28,599
a couple of [ __ ] Wing nuts and they

1006
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:32,159
were without question some of the nicest

1007
00:40:28,599 --> 00:40:35,519
people I've met in in [ __ ] years it

1008
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:39,838
couldn't have been nicer people who were

1009
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:41,838
so about the new world of cannabis and

1010
00:40:39,838 --> 00:40:43,639
so you know that's the kind of stuff

1011
00:40:41,838 --> 00:40:45,279
that really just it gets me gets me

1012
00:40:43,639 --> 00:40:47,960
moving

1013
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:50,200
because we you need all the pieces

1014
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:52,318
together you need you need to have the

1015
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:54,279
development of the land you need to have

1016
00:40:52,318 --> 00:40:56,480
the development of your genes you need

1017
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:58,680
to have the development of yourself and

1018
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:00,880
then that has to showcased and marketed

1019
00:40:58,679 --> 00:41:03,199
correctly and most people don't have the

1020
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:05,920
ability to Market they really don't

1021
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:10,000
you're spending too much time doing your

1022
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:12,440
craft and so what do you do and I think

1023
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,719
that you know with the with the ganier

1024
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:16,679
when we brought them all in you got to

1025
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:19,078
see the diversity of who they were where

1026
00:41:16,679 --> 00:41:22,480
it was people in every facet of the

1027
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:24,480
industry and their desire was to build a

1028
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,920
a a new industry that they could be part

1029
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,800
of because most of them were definitely

1030
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:31,159
younger than me

1031
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:33,440
so it's it's a great program and the

1032
00:41:31,159 --> 00:41:35,519
feedbacks been excellent and the the

1033
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:38,838
ramifications for cultivators that got

1034
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:40,599
highlighted it moved their product and

1035
00:41:38,838 --> 00:41:42,799
so that's where you start to see the

1036
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:45,400
changes when I because what happens is

1037
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:47,318
they all fly into San Francisco and then

1038
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:49,240
I tell them where to go up and down the

1039
00:41:47,318 --> 00:41:51,519
state to buy products so when they're

1040
00:41:49,239 --> 00:41:53,199
coming up the hill I say look these are

1041
00:41:51,519 --> 00:41:54,519
all the dispensaries that sell craft

1042
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:56,559
here are some Farms that have released

1043
00:41:54,519 --> 00:41:58,440
some really killer product I have no

1044
00:41:56,559 --> 00:42:00,799
money in it I mean it's not like I'm I'm

1045
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:03,119
trying to sell my [ __ ] I'm just pointing

1046
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:05,519
out people who have really good product

1047
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:08,400
and where you can access it and what it

1048
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:10,000
did was it emptied out their [ __ ] and

1049
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:12,039
all of a sudden when all your gear is

1050
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,719
being emptied out of dispensaries

1051
00:42:12,039 --> 00:42:15,880
because you have hundreds of people

1052
00:42:13,719 --> 00:42:18,959
highlighting your product and posting it

1053
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:21,599
and talking about it and consuming it it

1054
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:25,559
it allows there to be that that

1055
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:27,960
Spotlight that we need and it it has to

1056
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:29,680
be the product that does the talking

1057
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:32,079
it's the product that people have the

1058
00:42:29,679 --> 00:42:35,358
relationship with ultimately and so when

1059
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:37,519
people get to consume uh a product from

1060
00:42:35,358 --> 00:42:40,039
a a regen Farm or I would just call it

1061
00:42:37,519 --> 00:42:42,880
biologically driven there's a there's a

1062
00:42:40,039 --> 00:42:47,159
there's a there's a magic to it and the

1063
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:49,960
Gan students allow that to be seen so it

1064
00:42:47,159 --> 00:42:52,159
it's I'm I love it I really do man I

1065
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:54,358
love the students it's uh it's similar

1066
00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:55,679
to like you know how I got to know you

1067
00:42:54,358 --> 00:42:57,880
and and got to work with all these

1068
00:42:55,679 --> 00:42:58,149
breeders that you know

1069
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:01,260
were

1070
00:42:58,150 --> 00:43:01,260
[Music]

1071
00:43:04,838 --> 00:43:10,799
bring it with Shango and and put those

1072
00:43:07,838 --> 00:43:12,358
videos up all those guys went on and and

1073
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,920
have sold tons of seeds and I'm sure

1074
00:43:12,358 --> 00:43:16,199
they were selling lots before but that

1075
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:18,200
that was really set a platform for

1076
00:43:16,199 --> 00:43:20,118
everybody and like you say put a

1077
00:43:18,199 --> 00:43:22,039
spotlight where we can I could see that

1078
00:43:20,119 --> 00:43:23,599
you know different people were doing

1079
00:43:22,039 --> 00:43:26,079
different things and I could align with

1080
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:28,039
them you know for what my my my needs

1081
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:29,680
type thing and and that's kind of what

1082
00:43:28,039 --> 00:43:32,558
you what one thing that I see you bring

1083
00:43:29,679 --> 00:43:35,440
big time to the table in this conference

1084
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:37,000
is is a getting the genetics out there

1085
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:39,200
but be bringing breeders that are

1086
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,239
getting their genetics out and making

1087
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:42,879
the connection with the farmers you know

1088
00:43:41,239 --> 00:43:45,598
well the Breeders the Breeders we dealt

1089
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:47,318
with I used them for years as as

1090
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:49,200
partners you know like they would

1091
00:43:47,318 --> 00:43:51,719
produce work I would sift through the

1092
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:53,439
work I would find outliers and say Hey I

1093
00:43:51,719 --> 00:43:55,759
want to push this into the system and

1094
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:57,599
then they would get full credit for it

1095
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:01,040
and what it did is it allowed to then

1096
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:03,318
steer business back to them and when the

1097
00:44:01,039 --> 00:44:05,159
industry was changing I realized that

1098
00:44:03,318 --> 00:44:07,199
maybe you know 2% of them were going to

1099
00:44:05,159 --> 00:44:09,480
move forward because they didn't have

1100
00:44:07,199 --> 00:44:11,879
industrial assets which is what you need

1101
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:15,280
to have a license to do Nursery work to

1102
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:17,200
sell into the system and so I realized

1103
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:19,640
that all these people that I worked with

1104
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:22,318
were going to get Nate out of existence

1105
00:44:19,639 --> 00:44:24,358
and so what I did is I publicity work

1106
00:44:22,318 --> 00:44:26,119
for the Breeders because I wanted other

1107
00:44:24,358 --> 00:44:29,119
people to be able to see them on a

1108
00:44:26,119 --> 00:44:32,240
platform and hopefully be able to work

1109
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:34,119
with them in some uh combinate combined

1110
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:35,879
projects where you know you could bring

1111
00:44:34,119 --> 00:44:38,079
them in they could do work I didn't want

1112
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:40,119
to see them get knocked out of existence

1113
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:42,119
because they didn't have what I had

1114
00:44:40,119 --> 00:44:45,880
which was

1115
00:44:42,119 --> 00:44:47,720
infrastructure and it it was and I I

1116
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:49,480
paid for all that [ __ ] like all those

1117
00:44:47,719 --> 00:44:51,558
[ __ ] things all that stuff was out of

1118
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:53,440
the pocket there was no it wasn't like

1119
00:44:51,559 --> 00:44:56,160
uh I'm charging the breeder to be on

1120
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:59,000
stage I paid for all of it as a thank

1121
00:44:56,159 --> 00:45:01,960
you for all the work we got to do all

1122
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:06,358
the years together and so I still do it

1123
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:08,400
now if if you're solid I'll support you

1124
00:45:06,358 --> 00:45:12,199
because what I know is that all of us as

1125
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:14,838
a group make a a a healthy cannabis

1126
00:45:12,199 --> 00:45:16,879
community and I'm just grateful that I

1127
00:45:14,838 --> 00:45:19,440
got to spend you know [ __ ] since I was

1128
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:22,960
12 I've been in herb so I'm 55 so 43

1129
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:27,519
years of my life I spent here and if I

1130
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:31,639
could be positive in that role then then

1131
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:33,239
I'm grateful it it that's a full life so

1132
00:45:31,639 --> 00:45:35,519
it's the same with what we do here it's

1133
00:45:33,239 --> 00:45:38,239
all it's really about we used to be able

1134
00:45:35,519 --> 00:45:40,838
to just grow and move herb but the game

1135
00:45:38,239 --> 00:45:42,159
changed and if you're not really really

1136
00:45:40,838 --> 00:45:44,599
clear about what you're doing you're

1137
00:45:42,159 --> 00:45:47,719
going to get killed and what I'm seeing

1138
00:45:44,599 --> 00:45:52,000
is is a decimation for the small farmer

1139
00:45:47,719 --> 00:45:54,639
and it's it's uh shocking especially in

1140
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,639
my area where we have such a massive

1141
00:45:54,639 --> 00:45:58,239
collection of small farmers and so every

1142
00:45:56,639 --> 00:45:59,639
single person I know is basically on

1143
00:45:58,239 --> 00:46:02,959
their hands and knees getting kicked in

1144
00:45:59,639 --> 00:46:04,719
the [ __ ] face it's it's it's not it

1145
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:06,440
doesn't have to continue like this it

1146
00:46:04,719 --> 00:46:08,239
just what we have to do is we have to

1147
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:10,000
work in a way where we drive attention

1148
00:46:08,239 --> 00:46:12,439
to the product Drive attention to the

1149
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,559
people and create an attraction to the

1150
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:17,079
public that makes them want to play with

1151
00:46:14,559 --> 00:46:19,040
you you have to make it fun it's the Tom

1152
00:46:17,079 --> 00:46:20,280
Sawyer [ __ ] where I'm painting fences

1153
00:46:19,039 --> 00:46:23,599
and I'm getting people to paint the

1154
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:27,160
[ __ ] things with me not for me but

1155
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:28,760
with me and that that's what gets people

1156
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:32,118
involved people want to be part of

1157
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:34,160
things they want to be involved in our

1158
00:46:32,119 --> 00:46:38,079
lifestyle it's just a matter of how do

1159
00:46:34,159 --> 00:46:41,039
you expose them to it and and how do you

1160
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:42,359
how do you frame it and so I just am I

1161
00:46:41,039 --> 00:46:45,119
just seem like I found out over the

1162
00:46:42,358 --> 00:46:46,960
years that I'm I'm good at marketing and

1163
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:49,519
so what I'm trying to do is use the

1164
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:51,358
skills that I have to drive attention

1165
00:46:49,519 --> 00:46:53,559
and I just got lucky that I was really

1166
00:46:51,358 --> 00:46:57,279
creative years ago and came up with a

1167
00:46:53,559 --> 00:47:00,880
lot of different things that we're to

1168
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:03,839
use today as as those tools those

1169
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:07,760
vehicles and it's just it's it's uh it's

1170
00:47:03,838 --> 00:47:07,759
an odd position because it's not one

1171
00:47:20,159 --> 00:47:25,039
that dude I want to kind of introduce

1172

super exciting that you're Hest still

1196
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:40,519
back with us you uh have been in a lot

1197
00:48:38,838 --> 00:48:42,440
of transition in the last couple years

1198
00:48:40,519 --> 00:48:45,719
in your life and you want to just kind

1199
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:47,760
of share what you've been up to uh yeah

1200
00:48:45,719 --> 00:48:50,959
yeah um you know

1201
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:54,599
I mainly been uh working with farmers

1202
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:57,880
and food um across a bunch of different

1203
00:48:54,599 --> 00:49:04,318
Industries um and some in landscaping in

1204
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:10,039
um in golf um turf management um uh big

1205
00:49:04,318 --> 00:49:13,519
Old Farm in Iowa um doing corn soy

1206
00:49:10,039 --> 00:49:17,119
Alfalfa um wine grapes in Napa and uh

1207
00:49:13,519 --> 00:49:20,440
really for me uh what I feel like is a

1208
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:22,920
service I think to kind of the mission

1209
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:26,079
is um just finding the parameters of

1210
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:28,760
what what is what makes Financial sense

1211
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:32,000
for farmers um in natural farming we

1212
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:35,160
know the tech works but where are those

1213
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:39,000
those edges and those places where um

1214
00:49:35,159 --> 00:49:42,639
Farmers making a living because this um

1215
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:45,719
is streamlined in their operation and so

1216
00:49:42,639 --> 00:49:48,960
uh farming that uh finding that in you

1217
00:49:45,719 --> 00:49:52,039
know uh thousand acres of corn and soy

1218
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:56,079
and Alfalfa has been a interesting

1219
00:49:52,039 --> 00:49:59,159
journey and uh 700 Acres of wine grapes

1220
00:49:56,079 --> 00:50:01,680
you know it's not just because natural

1221
00:49:59,159 --> 00:50:03,558
farming super cool doesn't mean that

1222
00:50:01,679 --> 00:50:07,000
those Industries already know how to

1223
00:50:03,559 --> 00:50:09,920
plug it into a massive operation and so

1224
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:12,920
um kind of with my background I felt

1225
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:15,358
like that's been kind of the best use of

1226
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:18,200
uh moving this ball forward use of my

1227
00:50:15,358 --> 00:50:21,400
time and so it's been a lot of fun and a

1228
00:50:18,199 --> 00:50:24,558
lot of challenges um but some really

1229
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:27,318
cool success I hope to interview um some

1230
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:30,160
of those Farmers um and next several

1231
00:50:27,318 --> 00:50:33,079
months and get that online so we can

1232
00:50:30,159 --> 00:50:35,598
talk about uh a lot of those things and

1233
00:50:33,079 --> 00:50:38,000
just continue to get better at um

1234
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:42,119
basically returning to Tech we used to

1235
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:45,039
use a few Generations ago and um yeah

1236
00:50:42,119 --> 00:50:47,318
and then I'm sorry go ahead no go I was

1237
00:50:45,039 --> 00:50:50,798
just I was curious I've seen a lot of

1238
00:50:47,318 --> 00:50:53,400
Instagram photos of big IMO piles and I

1239
00:50:50,798 --> 00:50:56,639
was curious if you have a

1240
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:59,358
tally maybe how many pounds you've done

1241
00:50:56,639 --> 00:51:01,920
in a in a year or you know like some

1242
00:50:59,358 --> 00:51:06,159
sort of because they're pretty pretty

1243
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:09,639
big ones it's been fun to watch yeah um

1244
00:51:06,159 --> 00:51:11,960
truthfully like before anybody was

1245
00:51:09,639 --> 00:51:13,960
hashtagging k&amp;f is when I was probably

1246
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:16,720
making the most IO I was out in Hawaii

1247
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:19,318
making it for our farm um and we were

1248
00:51:16,719 --> 00:51:22,639
making 990,000 pound piles with the

1249
00:51:19,318 --> 00:51:28,039
right equipment and um but yeah no it's

1250
00:51:22,639 --> 00:51:30,960
been uh I think last year I made um

1251
00:51:28,039 --> 00:51:33,558
three

1252
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:38,039
um I made

1253
00:51:33,559 --> 00:51:42,280
uh yeah four four P four big old piles

1254
00:51:38,039 --> 00:51:46,000
um and uh one of them was 40,000 pounds

1255
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:50,400
one was 20,000 and I think one ended up

1256
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:56,239
at 80,000 PB so whatever that uh adds up

1257
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:57,559
to 1500 lb 15 150,000 lbs of IMO by Skid

1258
00:51:56,239 --> 00:52:00,479
steering

1259
00:51:57,559 --> 00:52:02,119
um it it was it was good fun um and it's

1260
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:05,079
worked really well for the farmers has

1261
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:08,680
been the kind of the main thing um right

1262
00:52:05,079 --> 00:52:12,400
now I'm in Colorado um I think I'm gonna

1263
00:52:08,679 --> 00:52:14,558
um kind of put my head down we've we

1264
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:17,318
played with that project with the um

1265
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:20,680
with the Brinker hofs out here and um I

1266
00:52:17,318 --> 00:52:22,480
feel like um what's needed is a little

1267
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:24,919
bit of finding those parameters what

1268
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:27,480
works here's what we're doing here's

1269
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:28,798
what didn't work you know and here's

1270
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:30,280
here's what's been played with and

1271
00:52:28,798 --> 00:52:32,759
here's what's working well and just

1272
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:36,519
really talking about that super publicly

1273
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:38,799
and and uh letting letting it be a a

1274
00:52:36,519 --> 00:52:41,358
group discussion is I think maybe the

1275
00:52:38,798 --> 00:52:43,920
better the best service for the industry

1276
00:52:41,358 --> 00:52:47,759
and like Kevin said you know what is

1277
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:51,960
what is it that um puts the spotlight to

1278
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:54,960
the product to um move uh move the

1279
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:56,760
flower and uh I think that's something

1280
00:52:54,960 --> 00:53:00,920
uh I'm looking forward to learning about

1281
00:52:56,760 --> 00:53:02,799
this year and uh Kevin appreciate the

1282
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:06,639
candid way in which you talk about all

1283
00:53:02,798 --> 00:53:08,719
things cannabis industry um and um yeah

1284
00:53:06,639 --> 00:53:11,358
and wondering what kind of ganier we

1285
00:53:08,719 --> 00:53:14,798
have out here in Colorado you know who's

1286
00:53:11,358 --> 00:53:18,598
who's looking for the craft cannabis um

1287
00:53:14,798 --> 00:53:21,318
but yeah I've um it was it was a lot of

1288
00:53:18,599 --> 00:53:23,559
um a lot of moving Parts last year as

1289
00:53:21,318 --> 00:53:26,000
far as um working with um bunch of

1290
00:53:23,559 --> 00:53:29,480
different Industries and um there was a

1291
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:31,599
lot of work work a lot of fun and uh

1292
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:35,798
this year I'm hoping not to run around

1293
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:38,640
quite as much um but um yeah still want

1294
00:53:35,798 --> 00:53:42,639
to kind of move the ball forward and uh

1295
00:53:38,639 --> 00:53:46,679
I've learned a ton um more than I knew a

1296
00:53:42,639 --> 00:53:49,000
year ago in natural farming and um I

1297
00:53:46,679 --> 00:53:51,558
feel like that's uh kind of the point is

1298
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:55,400
that as a International Community we

1299
00:53:51,559 --> 00:53:58,280
grow in um being able to apply you know

1300
00:53:55,400 --> 00:54:00,119
this really B basic technology you know

1301
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:02,359
people get into natural farming and they

1302
00:54:00,119 --> 00:54:05,318
want to get their microscope and it's

1303
00:54:02,358 --> 00:54:07,880
super cool and and wonderful and I

1304
00:54:05,318 --> 00:54:12,920
applaud it and at the same time like

1305
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:15,880
this technology is about using like the

1306
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:19,079
the really inexpensive and simple things

1307
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:22,280
to uh make the uh food world and

1308
00:54:19,079 --> 00:54:24,880
Medicine world go around so um kind of

1309
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:28,359
just honing that in personally and

1310
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:28,358
hopefully for the community

1311
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:35,200
awesome um I was going to ask about uh

1312
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:38,720
uh liquid IMO that's kind of the focus

1313
00:54:35,199 --> 00:54:41,000
of what you're G to talk about you wanna

1314
00:54:38,719 --> 00:54:43,199
drop

1315
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:47,960
any yeah

1316
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:50,919
um it's uh it's been fun um actually

1317
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:54,000
Steve and I have been playing with uh

1318
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:56,880
some of the parameters of producing

1319
00:54:54,000 --> 00:55:02,000
um uh kind of um

1320
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:07,440
indigenous um fungal Predators for um

1321
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:07,440
for kist uh insects

1322
00:55:19,798 --> 00:55:25,318
and about how versatile that is anywhere

1323
00:55:23,318 --> 00:55:26,838
you are in the world is uh definitely

1324
00:55:25,318 --> 00:55:28,599
something we'll do this year

1325
00:55:26,838 --> 00:55:32,440
getting into how do you

1326
00:55:28,599 --> 00:55:35,359
cultivate um fungi that will um chew on

1327
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:39,838
all the your beetle pests and your uh

1328
00:55:35,358 --> 00:55:43,318
your um you know various uh bugs with

1329
00:55:39,838 --> 00:55:45,798
carapus and and that's um that's fun

1330
00:55:43,318 --> 00:55:48,599
because you know whether you're in the

1331
00:55:45,798 --> 00:55:52,639
US with a high value crop like cannabis

1332
00:55:48,599 --> 00:55:55,079
or struggling with um you know uh

1333
00:55:52,639 --> 00:55:57,759
different different things caterpillars

1334
00:55:55,079 --> 00:55:59,960
in Zimbabwe like uh Steve was messing

1335
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:03,480
with you're you're able to use this

1336
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:07,280
technology um without uh a purchase you

1337
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:09,880
know really just by um cultivating uh

1338
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:13,000
Nature's Tech which has been um that's

1339
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:16,519
been a blast um because I think that

1340
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:18,559
with that um with kind of an sop with

1341
00:56:16,519 --> 00:56:22,038
that for the world I think we're going

1342
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:25,798
to have a a pretty effective

1343
00:56:22,039 --> 00:56:28,280
um Pest Management we call it IPO uh

1344
00:56:25,798 --> 00:56:32,358
integration Pest Management

1345
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:34,798
organisms and uh we're um you know I

1346
00:56:32,358 --> 00:56:37,279
think that's something that could be uh

1347
00:56:34,798 --> 00:56:41,519
further developed but also I think is

1348
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:44,920
really ready for any um you know uh

1349
00:56:41,519 --> 00:56:50,440
hobby farmer to apply a great effect and

1350
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:53,280
so that's fun to talk about also just um

1351
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:57,119
using the

1352
00:56:53,280 --> 00:57:00,519
um technology and resources available to

1353
00:56:57,119 --> 00:57:03,318
feed plants based on your growing style

1354
00:57:00,519 --> 00:57:05,960
not everybody's producing um really

1355
00:57:03,318 --> 00:57:08,279
amazing living soil you know some people

1356
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:10,720
that's a struggle you know they they

1357
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:12,680
it's winter they got no time to

1358
00:57:10,719 --> 00:57:14,199
cultivate their soil and they're just

1359
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:15,838
trying to go in with whatever raw

1360
00:57:14,199 --> 00:57:19,399
materials they can bring together and

1361
00:57:15,838 --> 00:57:22,440
they need to feed their plants and so um

1362
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:25,160
natural farming has tools for that but

1363
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:29,079
it's not all kind of laid out in some

1364
00:57:25,159 --> 00:57:31,719
ready uh you know sop for any different

1365
00:57:29,079 --> 00:57:34,839
scenario especially in cannabis with the

1366
00:57:31,719 --> 00:57:38,558
need to properly feed so I think um

1367
00:57:34,838 --> 00:57:41,519
talking about um how what ways you can

1368
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:44,319
add to the uh Witches Brew so to speak

1369
00:57:41,519 --> 00:57:47,440
to to make it more ready for your your

1370
00:57:44,318 --> 00:57:50,000
product um I think is uh something we'll

1371
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:52,599
get into kind of the versatility or the

1372
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:55,400
adaptability of it here's the base model

1373
00:57:52,599 --> 00:57:58,200
and uh what do you need for your farm so

1374
00:57:55,400 --> 00:58:01,760
that'll be fun to get into and just um

1375
00:57:58,199 --> 00:58:05,480
you know uh generally the technology

1376
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:09,039
isn't about chasing NPK but at the same

1377
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:11,440
time some people want to use it to just

1378
00:58:09,039 --> 00:58:13,880
push their their NES through the system

1379
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:16,960
and it's like you can do that yes that's

1380
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:18,519
not what this is all about but it can be

1381
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:20,639
done and there's a right way and a wrong

1382
00:58:18,519 --> 00:58:23,318
way to do it there's a way that can

1383
00:58:20,639 --> 00:58:25,239
create some more pest problems if you

1384
00:58:23,318 --> 00:58:27,440
get a imbalance then there's ways that

1385
00:58:25,239 --> 00:58:30,439
you can keep melon system right if

1386
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:32,679
you're doing like you know tissue sap

1387
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:34,760
tissue sap can't you're doing sap

1388
00:58:32,679 --> 00:58:36,759
analysis you know then you can make a

1389
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:40,280
correction you know really quickly with

1390
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:42,480
a foler feed or even a micro um soil

1391
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:45,519
feed you know type thing

1392
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:47,119
totally so super cool well I think we

1393
00:58:45,519 --> 00:58:49,960
might want to keep keep going down and

1394
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:53,119
get everyone in do we have you necklace

1395
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:56,318
think we got you bro can you hear me we

1396
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:58,720
can hear you welcome all right I'm

1397
00:58:56,318 --> 00:59:01,719
terrible at this stuff uh I'm good I I

1398
00:58:58,719 --> 00:59:03,239
I'm down at the our original Farm turn

1399
00:59:01,719 --> 00:59:06,199
turned out I was down here today so I

1400
00:59:03,239 --> 00:59:08,439
wanted to chime in but um but yeah uh

1401
00:59:06,199 --> 00:59:13,838
it's it's I'm excited for the conference

1402
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:13,838
and and I'm looking forward to sharing

1403
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:18,079
perspective what have you been up to the

1404
00:59:16,039 --> 00:59:19,799
last two years I know I know you've been

1405
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:21,839
uh putting some seeds out in the market

1406
00:59:19,798 --> 00:59:23,960
I've seen I'm sure you're putting

1407
00:59:21,838 --> 00:59:26,480
cannabis still into the Oregon market

1408
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:28,639
and what's going on you guys had a baby

1409
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:31,838
uh that's been probably big huge

1410
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:34,639
transition yep yep congratulations thank

1411
00:59:31,838 --> 00:59:37,639
you it's it's been it's been

1412
00:59:34,639 --> 00:59:37,639
uh

1413
00:59:50,159 --> 00:59:56,318
I um it's it's a real challenge I I it's

1414
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:58,920
definitely a challenge and and there's

1415
00:59:56,318 --> 01:00:00,318
all this balance between like passion

1416
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:02,358
and then feeling like it's you're

1417
01:00:00,318 --> 01:00:05,558
starting to get robbed of your passion

1418
01:00:02,358 --> 01:00:09,119
by just grinding away to try and you

1419
01:00:05,559 --> 01:00:11,200
know try and stay in it uh for whatever

1420
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:13,880
but you know the truth is is is having

1421
01:00:11,199 --> 01:00:18,519
the license and having the ability to be

1422
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:20,200
in a a public view has has given me a

1423
01:00:18,519 --> 01:00:22,440
lot of opportunity and and that

1424
01:00:20,199 --> 01:00:24,399
opportunity to explore genetics through

1425
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:27,200
the license is really you know it's

1426
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:29,680
really given me the office that I needed

1427
01:00:27,199 --> 01:00:33,239
in order to understand that process a

1428
01:00:29,679 --> 01:00:35,838
lot more um but my background really

1429
01:00:33,239 --> 01:00:37,598
like you know when I when I stop and

1430
01:00:35,838 --> 01:00:40,798
reflect on everything right now because

1431
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:43,760
it's such a crazy time and uh you know

1432
01:00:40,798 --> 01:00:46,038
there's a my background has really been

1433
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:48,280
uh about being in the wilderness and and

1434
01:00:46,039 --> 01:00:53,440
exploring wild places and and

1435
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:53,440
understanding the Earth uh and it's

1436
01:01:05,639 --> 01:01:10,920
you know and and that's really the the

1437
01:01:08,639 --> 01:01:14,078
the grounding component that connected

1438
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:16,280
me to cannabis because I was I was high

1439
01:01:14,079 --> 01:01:20,160
as you could be in all those places when

1440
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:22,720
I wasn't with students um but you know

1441
01:01:20,159 --> 01:01:24,960
uh having that ability to then explore

1442
01:01:22,719 --> 01:01:26,919
cannabis and and all that it's given to

1443
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:29,679
me and all of my connections to those

1444
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:31,720
places like has just driven me further

1445
01:01:29,679 --> 01:01:33,719
down the path uh exploring the

1446
01:01:31,719 --> 01:01:36,480
commercial side has been a little bit

1447
01:01:33,719 --> 01:01:38,919
like it's been a kind of a bummer uh to

1448
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:41,480
be realistic you know it makes me wonder

1449
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:44,119
sometimes if I was maybe you know just

1450
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:46,358
got into something that is just like I'm

1451
01:01:44,119 --> 01:01:49,200
not commercially driven like my passion

1452
01:01:46,358 --> 01:01:52,358
isn't about production and and per

1453
01:01:49,199 --> 01:01:54,278
square foot and you know uh what I

1454
01:01:52,358 --> 01:01:57,679
really want to share is is passion for

1455
01:01:54,278 --> 01:01:59,760
the Earth and and and changing systems

1456
01:01:57,679 --> 01:02:02,399
and and not trying to figure out how to

1457
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:06,839
squeeze some process into a commercial

1458
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:09,200
thing but rather changing systems uh you

1459
01:02:06,838 --> 01:02:11,558
know from the ground up and and

1460
01:02:09,199 --> 01:02:13,838
understanding where true Health lies and

1461
01:02:11,559 --> 01:02:16,880
so the last couple years has been quite

1462
01:02:13,838 --> 01:02:20,440
a an exploration into health and and a

1463
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:22,119
re-evaluation of what I'm doing um and

1464
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:24,318
and thank God for the genetic

1465
01:02:22,119 --> 01:02:26,440
Explorations and and the the time

1466
01:02:24,318 --> 01:02:28,838
devoted to you know

1467
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:32,200
observing how things respond to

1468
01:02:28,838 --> 01:02:33,960
environments and then asking ourselves

1469
01:02:32,199 --> 01:02:36,919
how do we want to relate to the

1470
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:38,960
environment and in going forward in in

1471
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:42,000
something such as a commercial business

1472
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:44,000
which I think kind of you know has its

1473
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:46,239
more downsides than upsides especially

1474
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:49,519
if you're coming from a simple uh

1475
01:02:46,239 --> 01:02:51,759
existence is is you know exploring that

1476
01:02:49,519 --> 01:02:54,239
relationship and then and then really

1477
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:56,440
you know remembering the important

1478
01:02:54,239 --> 01:03:00,000
things that got us to the the places

1479
01:02:56,440 --> 01:03:03,278
that we are at least for myself which is

1480
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:06,760
nature and and and the way the cosm

1481
01:03:03,278 --> 01:03:09,760
cosmic forces uh display themselves on

1482
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:12,160
Earth and and how we receive that energy

1483
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:14,960
and and how to work with those energies

1484
01:03:12,159 --> 01:03:18,078
and and exploring the idea that energy

1485
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:20,679
is actually a free resource that we have

1486
01:03:18,079 --> 01:03:22,960
to we have to be able to interpret it

1487
01:03:20,679 --> 01:03:24,919
well and when we think we got to take it

1488
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:26,960
transform it into something store it in

1489
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:28,639
a box and put it into a bunch of metal

1490
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:31,559
and then shoot it back out into the

1491
01:03:28,639 --> 01:03:33,239
world to me just seems a little bit like

1492
01:03:31,559 --> 01:03:34,839
you know at this point I don't know if

1493
01:03:33,239 --> 01:03:37,798
that's the right choice I don't know if

1494
01:03:34,838 --> 01:03:40,679
we need to keep it scaling our efforts

1495
01:03:37,798 --> 01:03:43,519
up in in production and I don't know if

1496
01:03:40,679 --> 01:03:45,318
we need to try and fit into a commercial

1497
01:03:43,519 --> 01:03:47,519
industry I I almost think it's the

1498
01:03:45,318 --> 01:03:51,400
commercialization and the industry that

1499
01:03:47,519 --> 01:03:53,278
has gotten us to these places so um and

1500
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:56,278
then you tack on all the kind of

1501
01:03:53,278 --> 01:03:58,760
[ __ ] stuff going on in in in in the

1502
01:03:56,278 --> 01:04:01,199
government and all that and just it's

1503
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:04,400
just it's you know I'm not I don't I'm

1504
01:04:01,199 --> 01:04:07,558
not sitting on any real clear Direction

1505
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:10,240
except for reconnecting to the natural

1506
01:04:07,559 --> 01:04:13,319
processes to better understand how we

1507
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:16,879
can create something with less energy uh

1508
01:04:13,318 --> 01:04:21,119
at least through the perverted system of

1509
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:23,160
of Industry um you know I I'm I'm always

1510
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:25,720
like you know the more things I package

1511
01:04:23,159 --> 01:04:28,480
and sell to the market the more depend

1512
01:04:25,719 --> 01:04:32,318
dependent I am on a manufacturing plant

1513
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:34,679
to make bags and and stickers and and

1514
01:04:32,318 --> 01:04:37,239
you know and it's hard to it's hard to

1515
01:04:34,679 --> 01:04:40,639
see myself wanting to keep doing more

1516
01:04:37,239 --> 01:04:42,199
than that um so or more of that so you

1517
01:04:40,639 --> 01:04:44,679
know I don't know really what it means I

1518
01:04:42,199 --> 01:04:48,118
just want to share perspective and and

1519
01:04:44,679 --> 01:04:51,000
and try to try to get to the heart and

1520
01:04:48,119 --> 01:04:54,039
soul of what it means to be working in

1521
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:56,239
relationship in a healthy way with our

1522
01:04:54,039 --> 01:04:59,240
planet in our Cosmos

1523
01:04:56,239 --> 01:05:01,118
um so I want to understand that the sun

1524
01:04:59,239 --> 01:05:04,078
is here to take care of us and that the

1525
01:05:01,119 --> 01:05:06,480
water is the most important and complete

1526
01:05:04,079 --> 01:05:09,920
essence of life that we have to we have

1527
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:11,880
to honor it and not control it and you

1528
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:14,960
know I don't want to play God I want to

1529
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:16,920
play participant in a much bigger thing

1530
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:19,358
than I can imagine I don't want to

1531
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:21,880
pretend I'm a creator of genetics I want

1532
01:05:19,358 --> 01:05:26,000
to understand that we are just Shepherds

1533
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:27,640
of this and and and we none of us create

1534
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:30,719
any of these genetics you know these

1535
01:05:27,639 --> 01:05:33,679
genetics are just us working with nature

1536
01:05:30,719 --> 01:05:36,278
in a way that helps change things in in

1537
01:05:33,679 --> 01:05:39,159
some way but so yeah you

1538
01:05:36,278 --> 01:05:41,119
know I'm I'm kind of at loss for words

1539
01:05:39,159 --> 01:05:45,239
I've had a lot of loss I've had a lot of

1540
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:47,119
gain uh it's a journey you know we we

1541
01:05:45,239 --> 01:05:48,838
both have that back the Outward Bound

1542
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:51,720
background we both worked for Outward

1543
01:05:48,838 --> 01:05:54,838
Bound and and kind of shared the similar

1544
01:05:51,719 --> 01:05:56,480
experience um and and it was the that my

1545
01:05:54,838 --> 01:05:58,639
experience in nature that really changed

1546
01:05:56,480 --> 01:06:00,039
me and and enlightened me that I wanted

1547
01:05:58,639 --> 01:06:01,278
to farm and when I you know when I

1548
01:06:00,039 --> 01:06:02,920
actually got injured that was like all

1549
01:06:01,278 --> 01:06:05,880
right this is where I'm I'm

1550
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:08,720
moving into and and I just reflecting

1551
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:10,880
back on that that time you know the the

1552
01:06:08,719 --> 01:06:12,919
the we would always we eat these stupid

1553
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:14,119
crackers called bickies and I'm sure you

1554
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:17,200
guys had them down in the South and

1555
01:06:14,119 --> 01:06:18,880
there these highly caloric crackers that

1556
01:06:17,199 --> 01:06:20,759
we'd eat with every meal because you

1557
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:22,720
know we could just pack them and and so

1558
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:24,520
we tell the story to the to the students

1559
01:06:22,719 --> 01:06:26,480
like on the first day and it was about

1560
01:06:24,519 --> 01:06:28,119
the concept of leave not trace and you

1561
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:29,719
you know did you guys do the same thing

1562
01:06:28,119 --> 01:06:31,160
when the the cookie crumbs or the

1563
01:06:29,719 --> 01:06:33,278
cracker crumbs would come down you talk

1564
01:06:31,159 --> 01:06:34,960
about the impacts in the environment of

1565
01:06:33,278 --> 01:06:38,960
you know dropping

1566
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:41,079
micro you we talked about micro trash

1567
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:42,440
and and we talked about Le no tray stuff

1568
01:06:41,079 --> 01:06:45,760
but I don't I don't recall the same

1569
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:47,559
crackers and stuff I was up in time okay

1570
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:48,839
we would use the story of the when the

1571
01:06:47,559 --> 01:06:50,798
kids would eat the crackers and the

1572
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:52,920
crumbs would fall to the ground and the

1573
01:06:50,798 --> 01:06:54,599
kid would just dust off you know these

1574
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:57,039
you know cracker crumbs all over and

1575
01:06:54,599 --> 01:06:58,519
we're like hey hey like think about this

1576
01:06:57,039 --> 01:07:00,079
what's going to happen to the it was

1577
01:06:58,519 --> 01:07:03,159
just like a teaching moment what do you

1578
01:07:00,079 --> 01:07:05,480
think happens to those cracker crumps a

1579
01:07:03,159 --> 01:07:07,159
mouse will probably eat it you know and

1580
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:09,358
they're like all right cool well what

1581
01:07:07,159 --> 01:07:11,759
what happens when mice have more energy

1582
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:13,278
you know and like someone like well they

1583
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:15,039
they probably [ __ ] and they probably

1584
01:07:13,278 --> 01:07:16,639
have some more mice like cool yeah yep

1585
01:07:15,039 --> 01:07:19,079
and we just kind of Follow that out

1586
01:07:16,639 --> 01:07:22,440
until we get to this like thing like

1587
01:07:19,079 --> 01:07:25,680
whoa my little micro litter here it

1588
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:27,559
really C it does cause an impact and and

1589
01:07:25,679 --> 01:07:29,879
it really just kind of sets the tone for

1590
01:07:27,559 --> 01:07:32,278
would set the tone for how we were to be

1591
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:34,960
respectfully moving through this through

1592
01:07:32,278 --> 01:07:36,639
the Wilderness you know and um anyways

1593
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:39,278
that that kind of has really impacted

1594
01:07:36,639 --> 01:07:41,118
the way I view gardening too and the way

1595
01:07:39,278 --> 01:07:43,838
I just view my impact on the whole

1596
01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:45,798
situation and yeah yeah I think that

1597
01:07:43,838 --> 01:07:48,719
that you know a lot of the reasons I

1598
01:07:45,798 --> 01:07:51,318
kind of left that space was I felt like

1599
01:07:48,719 --> 01:07:53,798
there was a big disconnection between

1600
01:07:51,318 --> 01:07:55,960
food and and I thought it was always

1601
01:07:53,798 --> 01:07:57,278
really weird to be traveling around

1602
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:59,278
you know when you talk about that I

1603
01:07:57,278 --> 01:08:00,639
think about like oh the the mouse

1604
01:07:59,278 --> 01:08:02,639
probably is going to get cancer now

1605
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:04,358
because of the glyphosate you know and

1606
01:08:02,639 --> 01:08:06,000
so like well it's probably not going to

1607
01:08:04,358 --> 01:08:09,038
do a whole lot more reproduction it

1608
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:12,239
might actually render itself infertile

1609
01:08:09,039 --> 01:08:15,559
uh however um I saw there there was a

1610
01:08:12,239 --> 01:08:17,399
big uh there was a big disconnect and

1611
01:08:15,559 --> 01:08:19,319
and I think my work has everything to do

1612
01:08:17,399 --> 01:08:20,639
with integration so I want to get back

1613
01:08:19,319 --> 01:08:22,759
out into the Wilderness but I don't want

1614
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:26,079
to carry bags of crap you know I don't

1615
01:08:22,759 --> 01:08:29,000
want to carry uh glyphosate drench

1616
01:08:26,079 --> 01:08:31,238
uh cookies and biscuit mix and and junk

1617
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:33,238
you know I I want to understand you know

1618
01:08:31,238 --> 01:08:35,358
the environment and the ecosystem and I

1619
01:08:33,238 --> 01:08:38,919
want to I want to go to these places I

1620
01:08:35,359 --> 01:08:43,838
want to integrate you know camping uh or

1621
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:46,239
or gardening and and uh I guess it would

1622
01:08:43,838 --> 01:08:49,079
be more of like you know I'm not I'm not

1623
01:08:46,238 --> 01:08:51,399
100% set that we we need to be farmers

1624
01:08:49,079 --> 01:08:53,198
and production oriented I I think an

1625
01:08:51,399 --> 01:08:55,039
integration piece we all need to

1626
01:08:53,198 --> 01:08:57,479
understand that in life you get stuck

1627
01:08:55,039 --> 01:08:59,119
doing one thing for too long I'm like I

1628
01:08:57,479 --> 01:09:02,119
always think it's important that

1629
01:08:59,119 --> 01:09:04,519
everybody knows how to grow food um that

1630
01:09:02,119 --> 01:09:06,640
doesn't mean everybody has to farm that

1631
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:08,520
means maybe for 10 years in your life

1632
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:10,719
you dedicate yourself to taking care of

1633
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:13,880
the community by growing food and then

1634
01:09:10,719 --> 01:09:15,439
that service pays you back later because

1635
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:17,039
now your kids are doing it and then you

1636
01:09:15,439 --> 01:09:19,879
get to eat that food from the people who

1637
01:09:17,039 --> 01:09:22,319
are farming but I I don't wish upon

1638
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:24,920
anybody a lifetime full of farming in

1639
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:27,239
this modern day because you see it

1640
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:28,960
especially from a commercial perspective

1641
01:09:27,238 --> 01:09:30,919
is like you just end up down the rabbit

1642
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:32,600
hole or you know like what we got going

1643
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:35,798
on in Oregon is you got a bunch of

1644
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:38,560
hidden um you got companies that are

1645
01:09:35,798 --> 01:09:40,679
buying licenses and and getting bigger

1646
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:42,839
they're not letting you know who's all

1647
01:09:40,679 --> 01:09:46,199
who but they're all connected they're

1648
01:09:42,838 --> 01:09:49,158
creating really uh easy for the

1649
01:09:46,198 --> 01:09:51,719
dispensary One-Stop shop like they pull

1650
01:09:49,158 --> 01:09:54,119
up they they've changed some of the laws

1651
01:09:51,719 --> 01:09:56,920
around manifest and making it easier for

1652
01:09:54,119 --> 01:09:58,960
the big guy to come in with everything

1653
01:09:56,920 --> 01:10:01,600
that one dispensary could need the

1654
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:03,719
intake manager then buys everything they

1655
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:05,760
need in that one time and now they no

1656
01:10:03,719 --> 01:10:07,679
longer have a budget for anybody else

1657
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:10,239
but it was so much easier with this guy

1658
01:10:07,679 --> 01:10:12,158
that showed up and he would take all the

1659
01:10:10,238 --> 01:10:14,879
product back that didn't sell and he

1660
01:10:12,158 --> 01:10:17,439
would you know provide you new options

1661
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:19,119
and then so it's like competing with

1662
01:10:17,439 --> 01:10:21,599
that and and being involved in the

1663
01:10:19,119 --> 01:10:23,319
market helps you realize wow from a a

1664
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:25,520
passionate without something like what

1665
01:10:23,319 --> 01:10:27,840
Kevin was talking about with is like

1666
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:31,679
somebody spearheading an ability to kind

1667
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:33,920
of Corral some really quality farmers in

1668
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:36,039
to a space that just is like hey man

1669
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:38,960
just do what you do and and create what

1670
01:10:36,039 --> 01:10:41,519
you create and we got a place for you um

1671
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:44,800
you know to play every component to be

1672
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:47,000
the marketer to be the you know all this

1673
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:48,880
stuff that goes on in the chain to get

1674
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:51,760
it to the end point even though we have

1675
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:54,199
some advantages here in Oregon being

1676
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:56,280
eaten up because we got other people who

1677
01:10:54,198 --> 01:10:58,238
are so competitive from a capitalist

1678
01:10:56,279 --> 01:11:00,559
standpoint that they're just making it

1679
01:10:58,238 --> 01:11:02,198
easier and easier and easier and then

1680
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:04,679
you got the little people who are like

1681
01:11:02,198 --> 01:11:08,479
well I actually need to make more than

1682
01:11:04,679 --> 01:11:10,399
you know $400 on a pound so uh how's

1683
01:11:08,479 --> 01:11:13,198
this going to function when they're

1684
01:11:10,399 --> 01:11:15,879
offering $200 pounds at at endless

1685
01:11:13,198 --> 01:11:19,399
amounts at any testing result that you

1686
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:21,880
could um you could you could imagine so

1687
01:11:19,399 --> 01:11:24,639
you know I

1688
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:26,440
there's I'm not here to speak about how

1689
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:28,119
great the market is by and none of us

1690
01:11:26,439 --> 01:11:31,639
really are we're all here to talk about

1691
01:11:28,119 --> 01:11:35,719
our passion um and and and I think you

1692
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:37,719
know the only reason that our farm still

1693
01:11:35,719 --> 01:11:40,319
exists has everything to do with our

1694
01:11:37,719 --> 01:11:42,399
ability to produce without stuff so it's

1695
01:11:40,319 --> 01:11:44,079
like you know you can measure how

1696
01:11:42,399 --> 01:11:46,559
regenerative You Are by how many

1697
01:11:44,079 --> 01:11:49,198
products you buy and the least amount

1698
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:53,400
that you buy as a product from a store

1699
01:11:49,198 --> 01:11:53,399
to make your operation exist

1700
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:10,199
out some indigenous microorganisms

1701
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:12,440
whatever you're doing if you can do it

1702
01:12:10,198 --> 01:12:15,399
with the resources from your space in

1703
01:12:12,439 --> 01:12:17,638
whatever ways I think wow you're you're

1704
01:12:15,399 --> 01:12:20,960
you're able to at least exist in that

1705
01:12:17,639 --> 01:12:23,319
place if you really want to um and so

1706
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:25,198
you know we can drop our prices to these

1707
01:12:23,319 --> 01:12:26,679
places that even the corporate people

1708
01:12:25,198 --> 01:12:29,079
people don't really like but it doesn't

1709
01:12:26,679 --> 01:12:32,000
serve us and it doesn't it doesn't

1710
01:12:29,079 --> 01:12:34,679
really uh get us where we want to get to

1711
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:38,479
which is essentially you know I I I

1712
01:12:34,679 --> 01:12:41,158
don't wantan to I I'm not trying to like

1713
01:12:38,479 --> 01:12:45,000
get crazy rich I I want to own land one

1714
01:12:41,158 --> 01:12:47,439
day you know I'm the owner of our farm

1715
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:51,920
however uh it's not like that doesn't

1716
01:12:47,439 --> 01:12:55,439
come with a whole slw of debt so you

1717
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:58,840
know I'm thankful I have access to land

1718
01:12:55,439 --> 01:13:01,079
um I'm thankful and and grateful for

1719
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:03,239
having the experience of holding a

1720
01:13:01,079 --> 01:13:05,039
license of working with genetics and and

1721
01:13:03,238 --> 01:13:09,919
being able to do the things that I need

1722
01:13:05,039 --> 01:13:12,719
to do uh in that way um but I I you know

1723
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:15,079
I I don't know if any farming Pursuit is

1724
01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:17,239
the one if you don't already own land I

1725
01:13:15,079 --> 01:13:21,519
don't know if you're GNA buy your land

1726
01:13:17,238 --> 01:13:23,678
off of your farming so uh because one

1727
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:25,920
the to scale up the infrastructure costs

1728
01:13:23,679 --> 01:13:28,600
so much so you know you

1729
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:30,840
know H I've thought I've thought about

1730
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:32,840
vertical integration and taking on

1731
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:35,119
another half a million in debt and had

1732
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:37,920
opportunities and but you know it's like

1733
01:13:35,119 --> 01:13:40,158
I don't see myself as I go further down

1734
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:42,119
this route ending up in Las Vegas and

1735
01:13:40,158 --> 01:13:44,638
and and rubbing elbows with a bunch of

1736
01:13:42,119 --> 01:13:46,639
people in hot tubs to [ __ ] sell some

1737
01:13:44,639 --> 01:13:47,960
weed you know it's like it's not my it's

1738
01:13:46,639 --> 01:13:52,119
not my gig

1739
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:56,560
so I I use this time as a as a way to

1740
01:13:52,119 --> 01:13:59,679
bank a whole lot of uh value in seeds um

1741
01:13:56,560 --> 01:14:01,880
and so you know I'm just banking value

1742
01:13:59,679 --> 01:14:04,600
of what I believe has value which is

1743
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:06,760
something that feeds the future which is

1744
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:09,440
seeds beyond anything else the thing

1745
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:11,760
that holds the most value is is our seed

1746
01:14:09,439 --> 01:14:13,079
banks it always has been and and always

1747
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:15,840
will be at least to anybody who

1748
01:14:13,079 --> 01:14:18,679
cultivates now there's uh hunter

1749
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:20,840
gatherers that do an amazing job hardly

1750
01:14:18,679 --> 01:14:23,840
with having to do so that's the thing

1751
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:23,840
that

1752
01:14:35,679 --> 01:14:42,000
are working with the powers and the

1753
01:14:38,279 --> 01:14:44,679
forces that are way stronger than we are

1754
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:47,000
um and that is again the cosmos the the

1755
01:14:44,679 --> 01:14:50,600
the reason we are holding some kind of

1756
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:54,760
orbit around a sun is certainly what

1757
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:57,000
keeps us capable of breathing and living

1758
01:14:54,760 --> 01:14:59,880
so so I want to connect with those

1759
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:02,760
strong forces so we can stay alive

1760
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:04,960
through all the craziness of this

1761
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:06,639
perverted reality that humans have

1762
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:08,239
created and a lot of it has to do with

1763
01:15:06,639 --> 01:15:10,920
patriarchy a lot of it has to do with

1764
01:15:08,238 --> 01:15:14,279
industrialism a lot of it has to do with

1765
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:16,199
um with capitalism and economy and

1766
01:15:14,279 --> 01:15:17,479
colonialism like these are all the

1767
01:15:16,198 --> 01:15:20,039
things that have brought us to this

1768
01:15:17,479 --> 01:15:21,519
point and at some point we really got to

1769
01:15:20,039 --> 01:15:23,679
look at it all and we really have to

1770
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:26,679
change the systems from from the bottom

1771
01:15:23,679 --> 01:15:29,158
up and change our foundation so we can

1772
01:15:26,679 --> 01:15:31,600
not continue to feed the system we don't

1773
01:15:29,158 --> 01:15:34,960
believe in which is what I believe we do

1774
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:37,159
the further into business we get so you

1775
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:38,480
know I don't know what the answers are I

1776
01:15:37,158 --> 01:15:41,000
know that it feels good to watch a

1777
01:15:38,479 --> 01:15:42,638
sunset still and I want to always honor

1778
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:44,399
that space I want to be able to go

1779
01:15:42,639 --> 01:15:47,239
outside and watch the birds with a

1780
01:15:44,399 --> 01:15:50,279
little boy who's Blown Away by them so I

1781
01:15:47,238 --> 01:15:51,919
can remember the awe of the cosmos and

1782
01:15:50,279 --> 01:15:54,519
and how it is incredible that we are

1783
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:57,840
here breathing and living and I don't

1784
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:59,960
want to live in fear of of the natural

1785
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:02,440
world like it's coming out to kill us I

1786
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:04,158
don't believe that I don't believe a lot

1787
01:16:02,439 --> 01:16:05,799
of the common things that are going

1788
01:16:04,158 --> 01:16:07,319
around right now

1789
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:10,480
so

1790
01:16:07,319 --> 01:16:13,158

1791
01:16:10,479 --> 01:16:15,079

I mean it was just not necessarily like

1800
01:16:29,238 --> 01:16:35,399
a blast of pure joy and fun but like a

1801
01:16:32,158 --> 01:16:39,000
blast of reality now post when I was

01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:39,880
the ganier program you know I've been

1825
01:17:38,039 --> 01:17:42,198
able to host a lot of those students

1826
01:17:39,880 --> 01:17:45,079
here on the farm through my camping and

1827
01:17:42,198 --> 01:17:46,759
hip camp and hearing Nick say like you

1828
01:17:45,079 --> 01:17:49,439
know having the integration I really

1829
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:51,880
feel lucky to just be able to serve this

1830
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:54,039
community with a really tiny tiny Farm

1831
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:56,239
you know I scaled down when all this

1832
01:17:54,039 --> 01:17:59,920
happened and I got way way way way way

1833
01:17:56,238 --> 01:18:01,879
smaller sold off a farm and I feel like

1834
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:04,480
um you know I'm just really lucky to be

1835
01:18:01,880 --> 01:18:08,279
able to participate in this level and be

1836
01:18:04,479 --> 01:18:10,319
on H church with you guys and you know

1837
01:18:08,279 --> 01:18:12,238
it is a great great great experience and

1838
01:18:10,319 --> 01:18:14,759
a great honor to be able just share my

1839
01:18:12,238 --> 01:18:17,198
garden with so many

1840
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:19,600
people

1841
01:18:17,198 --> 01:18:21,279
yeah you know this right now I'm just

1842
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:24,560
going through building a bathroom with

1843
01:18:21,279 --> 01:18:25,639
the trellis program um funds and I've

1844
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:28,560
got

1845
01:18:25,639 --> 01:18:30,400
Equity grants and I you know I for me I

1846
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:33,000
feel really supported by the planning

1847
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:34,960
department I feel supported by the

1848
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:36,198
county and it's like that's way

1849
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:37,520
different than what most people are

1850
01:18:36,198 --> 01:18:41,519
thinking and I just have to be really

1851
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:43,800
really grateful to be able to as myself

1852
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:46,440
you know just one person on this Farm I

1853
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:48,039
have 3,000 square feet and you know Nick

1854
01:18:46,439 --> 01:18:50,279
was saying you can measure your your

1855
01:18:48,039 --> 01:18:52,960
regenerative by the products you buy and

1856
01:18:50,279 --> 01:18:55,359
it's like I really buy anything so I

1857
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:57,760
feel pretty good about that

1858
01:18:55,359 --> 01:18:59,960
no 100% you have a beautiful beautiful

1859
01:18:57,760 --> 01:19:02,600
garden and and it's cool that the way

1860
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:04,439
you work through and turn your shop into

1861
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:06,440
like you're turning it into a community

1862
01:19:04,439 --> 01:19:08,519
space and she's right across the you

1863
01:19:06,439 --> 01:19:10,559
know two-minute drive from the

1864
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:13,480
Richardson Grove RV park where we have

1865
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:15,520
the conference right by One Log and you

1866
01:19:13,479 --> 01:19:17,238
know really close to benbo and and and

1867
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:19,520
you know kind of where like like Kev was

1868
01:19:17,238 --> 01:19:21,079
saying where he does the ganier but um

1869
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:22,920
you're going to be able to do the goal

1870
01:19:21,079 --> 01:19:25,399
is to do courses like little classes

1871
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:28,199
mini classes and education and that you

1872
01:19:25,399 --> 01:19:30,238
can also use that facility for what else

1873
01:19:28,198 --> 01:19:33,759
I think Farmers to do processing a

1874
01:19:30,238 --> 01:19:37,399
little bit know it's it's a model that's

1875
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:37,400
not really accessible right

1876
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:54,840
now steps you know for me to build this

1877
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:56,759
bathroom I have to get my old septic

1878
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:59,520
permit signed off and you know yesterday

1879
01:19:56,760 --> 01:20:01,320
I was digging holes for five feet deep

1880
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:04,760
just working on that I mean it's just a

1881
01:20:01,319 --> 01:20:06,439
ton of tiny tiny steps and I do feel

1882
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:08,520
supported and it does give me

1883
01:20:06,439 --> 01:20:10,158
inspiration to keep moving forward but

1884
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:12,719
at the same time it is true it's like

1885
01:20:10,158 --> 01:20:15,279
how much more can I take on it does take

1886
01:20:12,719 --> 01:20:18,158
community support and I do feel like I'm

1887
01:20:15,279 --> 01:20:20,198
in a really great position you know and

1888
01:20:18,158 --> 01:20:22,839
a great place and I'm involved in the

1889
01:20:20,198 --> 01:20:25,000
right things so if I just have to keep

1890
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:27,440
you know taking the baby steps not

1891
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:29,840
expecting too much to happen at once and

1892
01:20:27,439 --> 01:20:32,519
just be grateful for the opportunity and

1893
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:34,159
the space that I've created and the

1894
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:37,560
interest that there is you know I wish

1895
01:20:34,158 --> 01:20:40,679
more Farmers had the community or the

1896
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:42,159
consumer Outreach that I have because

1897
01:20:40,679 --> 01:20:44,239
for me I see that there are people

1898
01:20:42,158 --> 01:20:46,679
valuing craft and they don't know how to

1899
01:20:44,238 --> 01:20:48,359
identify it and just having a place

1900
01:20:46,679 --> 01:20:51,399
where they feel comfortable with the

1901
01:20:48,359 --> 01:20:53,119
vernacular and the language and know and

1902
01:20:51,399 --> 01:20:55,319
I can about other brands you know

1903
01:20:53,119 --> 01:20:57,679
there's not very many far Farms that are

1904
01:20:55,319 --> 01:21:01,119
out there promoting multiple other

1905
01:20:57,679 --> 01:21:03,399
brands you know on a weekly basis and so

1906
01:21:01,119 --> 01:21:05,079
I feel really lucky to just have you

1907
01:21:03,399 --> 01:21:06,759
know that personal interaction and in

1908
01:21:05,079 --> 01:21:08,760
place where people can have access to

1909
01:21:06,760 --> 01:21:10,600
the plant in such a natural way it is

1910
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:13,280
more of a garden and less of a

1911
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:14,760
production Zone and I think that's

1912
01:21:13,279 --> 01:21:17,479
really different on what they see when

1913
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:19,719
they go on a cannabis tour so I mean I

1914
01:21:17,479 --> 01:21:21,678
just feel lucky to be able to offer

1915
01:21:19,719 --> 01:21:23,399
something different and so sweet you

1916
01:21:21,679 --> 01:21:25,079
know people often tell me like you're

1917
01:21:23,399 --> 01:21:27,198
the last person still having fun growing

1918
01:21:25,079 --> 01:21:30,319
weed and it's because it is just me in

1919
01:21:27,198 --> 01:21:31,839
my garden I had a huge staff and it was

1920
01:21:30,319 --> 01:21:34,920
like you know the pressure that I had

1921
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:38,319
before that wasn't as fun it was organic

1922
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:39,880
and it was in native soil but it was

1923
01:21:38,319 --> 01:21:41,679
high production and a lot of pressure

1924

to a couple people I'm like I got to get

1957
01:23:01,679 --> 01:23:06,840
Josh to come do a building course you

1958
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:08,639
know and I would just love to learn how

1959

to do that man it's and you've been

1960
01:23:08,639 --> 01:23:11,279
building a lot too so that's what I I

1961
01:23:10,158 --> 01:23:15,238
wanted to lead

1962
01:23:11,279 --> 01:23:18,840
into yeah where oh we're um you know

1963
01:23:15,238 --> 01:23:22,119
what uh amazing um and uh the one of the

1964
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:24,600
things that we've been able to do in our

1965
01:23:22,119 --> 01:23:27,840
life is continue to follow our dreams

1966
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:30,840
and passions and by giving each other

1967
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:34,360
enough space you know I've been able to

1968
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:36,679
to Really dive into what I do and Kelly

1969
01:23:34,359 --> 01:23:39,439
also has been able to dive into what you

1970
01:23:36,679 --> 01:23:42,520
know she does and supporting the the

1971
01:23:39,439 --> 01:23:45,759
human microbiome and the soil microbiome

1972
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:49,080
and the connection of the two and and uh

1973
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:53,440
but um you know the building is part of

1974
01:23:49,079 --> 01:23:54,840
what's really amazing on our farm and uh

1975
01:23:53,439 --> 01:23:56,799
we you know natural building and

1976
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:58,600
building from local materials and not

1977
01:23:56,800 --> 01:24:00,719
even not going out to get commercial

1978
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:03,079
style wood you know and figuring out how

1979
01:24:00,719 --> 01:24:06,520
to gather it out of the lake or after a

1980
01:24:03,079 --> 01:24:09,639
big storm or instead of clearing roads

1981
01:24:06,520 --> 01:24:13,080
you know hey there's a nice building log

1982
01:24:09,639 --> 01:24:13,079
and keeping it on the side

1983
01:24:13,238 --> 01:24:20,479
or branches figuring out how to

1984
01:24:17,319 --> 01:24:24,519
incorporate them in the soil or

1985
01:24:20,479 --> 01:24:27,359
make or divert the groundwater in the

1986
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:30,600
winter during a big rainstorm or how to

1987
01:24:27,359 --> 01:24:32,799
use that material as fungal filters to

1988
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:36,639
filter the Earth so that our po our farm

1989
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:38,360
has a positive impact on the farm but I

1990
01:24:36,639 --> 01:24:39,800
think some of the most powerful work

1991
01:24:38,359 --> 01:24:41,799
that we've been doing in the last two

1992
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:43,960
years is a lot of the work that Kelly's

1993
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:43,960
been

1994
01:24:44,198 --> 01:24:49,238
doing I think that a lot of the work

1995
01:24:47,359 --> 01:24:52,960
that's been going on has been what Josh

1996
01:24:49,238 --> 01:24:55,118
has been doing so um first of all I just

1997
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:57,198
wanted to say that we're really stoked

1998
01:24:55,118 --> 01:24:59,599
about the regenerative conference

1999
01:24:57,198 --> 01:25:02,399
because what we do is we support

2000
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:04,239
regenerative lifestyle we support

2001
01:25:02,399 --> 01:25:08,319
regenerative small farmers the whole

2002
01:25:04,238 --> 01:25:11,039
idea of D pure everything that doing is

2003
01:25:08,319 --> 01:25:14,238
supporting small farmers and that means

2004
01:25:11,039 --> 01:25:17,399
actually supporting sovereignty of small

2005
01:25:14,238 --> 01:25:20,079
farmers we can't just put out this idea

2006
01:25:17,399 --> 01:25:22,719
that oh let's have them be called a

2007
01:25:20,079 --> 01:25:24,840
small farmer but let's them have access

2008
01:25:22,719 --> 01:25:26,800
to all of the licensing that all of the

2009
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:29,319
big corporate entities all of the same

2010
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:31,520
fees all of the same fines that doesn't

2011
01:25:29,319 --> 01:25:34,118
make any sense at all so what we've been

2012
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:37,960
working on is sovereignty for small

2013
01:25:34,118 --> 01:25:40,000
farmers sovereignty for our own human

2014
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:42,198
microbiome um the reason why we're not

2015
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:44,000
coming down for the for the regenerative

2016
01:25:42,198 --> 01:25:45,879
conference is we've never aligned with

2017
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:49,039
any federal government and we're not

2018
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:51,118
going to start now so just laying that

2019
01:25:49,039 --> 01:25:53,158
out like everything that's going on is

2020
01:25:51,118 --> 01:25:56,399
just not where we want to be aligned at

2021
01:25:53,158 --> 01:25:58,599
all we have the ability to come down but

2022
01:25:56,399 --> 01:26:01,559
we just don't want to partake in that

2023
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:03,480
and that is also representative of our

2024
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:05,360
life and where we're going not just

2025
01:26:03,479 --> 01:26:07,919
representative of this pandemic and

2026
01:26:05,359 --> 01:26:10,599
whatever [ __ ] is happening there but

2027
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:14,239
representative of us becoming more and

2028
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:16,239
more Sovereign and and really educating

2029
01:26:14,238 --> 01:26:17,559
that out there and how is it that we can

2030
01:26:16,238 --> 01:26:21,238
truly

2031
01:26:17,560 --> 01:26:22,679
change the laws so these big corporate

2032
01:26:21,238 --> 01:26:25,959
entities and these big political

2033
01:26:22,679 --> 01:26:28,960
structures basically lay P the [ __ ] off

2034
01:26:25,960 --> 01:26:31,319
of the small farmer why is it that we

2035
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:33,359
can't grow many multiple

2036
01:26:31,319 --> 01:26:34,920
crops the reason why is because we have

2037
01:26:33,359 --> 01:26:36,880
to spend all of our money and all of our

2038
01:26:34,920 --> 01:26:39,960
financing and all of our land and all of

2039
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:43,679
everything on cannabis I mean all of us

2040
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:46,039
in the regenerative um farming uh module

2041
01:26:43,679 --> 01:26:48,279
and everybody in Dem pure grows a

2042
01:26:46,039 --> 01:26:49,760
tremendous amount of food and flowers

2043
01:26:48,279 --> 01:26:51,920
and they use their land for all

2044
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:54,320
different types of Education components

2045
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:58,199
tourism tourism I mean we could go on

2046
01:26:54,319 --> 01:27:00,519
and on so we really need to be talking

2047
01:26:58,198 --> 01:27:03,000
about what is the next level cannabis

2048
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:05,840
has got us to this point but cannabis

2049
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:08,118
has always opened up doors and right now

2050
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:11,199
cannabis is opening up a door of a

2051
01:27:08,118 --> 01:27:12,960
myriad of plant medicine a myriad of of

2052
01:27:11,198 --> 01:27:16,039
vegetable growing everything that Nick

2053
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:19,079
was saying Nick by the way love you you

2054
01:27:16,039 --> 01:27:22,198
I mean everything about you and Liz and

2055
01:27:19,079 --> 01:27:25,399

2056
01:27:22,198 --> 01:27:26,960
know the support we love sheris Daniel

2057
01:27:25,399 --> 01:27:31,920
everything that you all have been going

2058
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:34,520
through I mean it it's just just here

2059
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:35,359
and and listening to you talk makes my

2060
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:38,239
heart

2061
01:27:35,359 --> 01:27:40,639
expand thank you and and all of you all

2062
01:27:38,238 --> 01:27:43,238
seeing all of you all after all of this

2063
01:27:40,639 --> 01:27:46,239
time makes me realize what it is that

2064
01:27:43,238 --> 01:27:48,279
we're doing and and and why it is that

2065
01:27:46,238 --> 01:27:50,839
we're so passionate about the work that

2066
01:27:48,279 --> 01:27:52,800
we're doing every single day we wake up

2067
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:54,960
every single day and we're thinking

2068
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:56,679
about the small farmer the sovereignty

2069
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:59,840
of the small farmer and we're going to

2070
01:27:56,679 --> 01:28:01,399
be really blessed this summer to have

2071
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:04,000
even though we don't align with the

2072
01:28:01,399 --> 01:28:05,638
federal government the federal uh

2073
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:08,439
Department of Agriculture is going to be

2074
01:28:05,639 --> 01:28:11,400
coming to our farm with the premiere

2075
01:28:08,439 --> 01:28:13,359
again because they want to start talking

2076
01:28:11,399 --> 01:28:14,759
about what it is that we're doing

2077
01:28:13,359 --> 01:28:17,198
because what it is that we're doing

2078
01:28:14,760 --> 01:28:20,079
represents every single one of you on

2079
01:28:17,198 --> 01:28:23,000
this camera and so many of you all who

2080
01:28:20,079 --> 01:28:24,840
are listening and that is the next step

2081
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:26,679
in cannabis cultivation is the

2082
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:29,360
sovereignty of the small farmer so we

2083
01:28:26,679 --> 01:28:32,079
have the ability to grow a myriad of all

2084
01:28:29,359 --> 01:28:34,799
of those plant medicines because plant

2085
01:28:32,079 --> 01:28:37,359
medicine is the next step to us being

2086
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:38,760
able to be Sovereign for us to be able

2087
01:28:37,359 --> 01:28:42,439
to have an

2088
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:46,360
independence and cannabis came

2089
01:28:42,439 --> 01:28:49,719
from uh a place of herbalism and a place

2090
01:28:46,359 --> 01:28:53,639
of of the medicine man or the wise woman

2091
01:28:49,719 --> 01:28:57,880
and we want to keep cannabis sacred and

2092
01:28:53,639 --> 01:28:59,880
keep regenerative Lifestyles alive which

2093
01:28:57,880 --> 01:29:02,159
the teachings are in the wilderness the

2094
01:28:59,880 --> 01:29:06,000
teachings are in nature the teachings

2095
01:29:02,158 --> 01:29:08,920
are within regenerative family and so

2096
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:12,359
like the plants that we ingest we want

2097
01:29:08,920 --> 01:29:13,679
to become adaptable so in this time it's

2098
01:29:12,359 --> 01:29:16,198
difficult we've laid out some of the

2099
01:29:13,679 --> 01:29:20,800
things that are hard but like the

2100
01:29:16,198 --> 01:29:24,158
microbiome eats pathogens we need to eat

2101
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:27,480
oppression and turn it into opportunity

2102
01:29:24,158 --> 01:29:29,599
so through our adaptogenic ability and

2103
01:29:27,479 --> 01:29:31,079
our ability to connect like mycelium

2104
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:33,600
underground with these intelligent

2105
01:29:31,079 --> 01:29:36,238
beings we're going to will always be

2106
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:37,960
here we are going to always be here

2107
01:29:36,238 --> 01:29:40,198
because we're strong we're powerful we

2108
01:29:37,960 --> 01:29:43,039
matter and we have an alignment with

2109
01:29:40,198 --> 01:29:46,359
nature and if we're going to talk about

2110
01:29:43,039 --> 01:29:48,479
water water pulses through our body at

2111
01:29:46,359 --> 01:29:51,799
the highest percentage of anything in

2112
01:29:48,479 --> 01:29:55,519
our body water covers the earth water

2113
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:59,039
surrounds the Earth we we may live in an

2114
01:29:55,520 --> 01:30:01,679
amniotic fluid the the Earth is probably

2115
01:29:59,039 --> 01:30:04,639
covered in amniotic fluid and that's

2116
01:30:01,679 --> 01:30:07,399
what the northern lights shine on and

2117
01:30:04,639 --> 01:30:09,639
glisten and they show us the colors of

2118
01:30:07,399 --> 01:30:12,359
of the infinite they they show us that

2119
01:30:09,639 --> 01:30:15,480
we live in a multi-dimensional space

2120
01:30:12,359 --> 01:30:20,479
because of water yeah and water is the

2121
01:30:15,479 --> 01:30:24,718
essence of life so when we Ally with

2122
01:30:20,479 --> 01:30:27,759
with helping water transform nut nut we

2123
01:30:24,719 --> 01:30:30,359
become smarter when we drink water

2124
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:32,960
that's dumbed down with toxicity then it

2125
01:30:30,359 --> 01:30:36,238
tells other water in our body to not be

2126
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:39,639
smart and not regenerate we want our

2127
01:30:36,238 --> 01:30:43,000
water to regenerate uh masimoto the you

2128
01:30:39,639 --> 01:30:47,000
know the the the the scientist you know

2129
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:50,079
shows how water you know changes through

2130
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:52,479
thoughts and through Harmony and through

2131
01:30:50,079 --> 01:30:56,800
well-being so

2132
01:30:52,479 --> 01:30:59,799
we're for in our land and texturing our

2133
01:30:56,800 --> 01:31:03,360
land to structure the water as it falls

2134
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:06,039
from the sky and structure through some

2135
01:31:03,359 --> 01:31:09,319
intricate system to go into our body to

2136
01:31:06,039 --> 01:31:11,679
build our intelligence and to pulse the

2137
01:31:09,319 --> 01:31:13,439
protoplasm of every plant and every tree

2138
01:31:11,679 --> 01:31:16,719
to create polypores and magical

2139
01:31:13,439 --> 01:31:19,319
secondary metabolites water is life and

2140
01:31:16,719 --> 01:31:23,920
when we choose to build our

2141
01:31:19,319 --> 01:31:26,599
soil like a sponge to grow fungi

2142
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:29,639
waterers our our Ultimate Ally our

2143
01:31:26,600 --> 01:31:32,320
ultimate wellness and when we eat it we

2144
01:31:29,639 --> 01:31:33,880
become more intelligent when it breathes

2145
01:31:32,319 --> 01:31:36,519
with the plants we become more

2146
01:31:33,880 --> 01:31:39,319
intelligent and water is something we

2147
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:41,400
all need to really uh look into on how

2148
01:31:39,319 --> 01:31:44,039
we can have a healthy Source when you

2149
01:31:41,399 --> 01:31:46,839
look for a piece of property try and

2150
01:31:44,039 --> 01:31:49,679
find good water number one without good

2151
01:31:46,840 --> 01:31:52,639
water it's hard to be healthy it's hard

2152
01:31:49,679 --> 01:31:54,800
to be healthy so luckily our

2153
01:31:52,639 --> 01:31:58,159
regenerative lifestyle we've paid off

2154
01:31:54,800 --> 01:32:01,320
our land we have the ability to to to

2155
01:31:58,158 --> 01:32:04,399
Ally with nature we have the ability

2156
01:32:01,319 --> 01:32:06,039
to live on the edge of wilderness and

2157
01:32:04,399 --> 01:32:07,638
create our own world and if we're going

2158
01:32:06,039 --> 01:32:10,399
to create our own world it's going to be

2159
01:32:07,639 --> 01:32:12,840
super magical and also just speaking

2160
01:32:10,399 --> 01:32:15,198
about secondary metabolites I just

2161
01:32:12,840 --> 01:32:17,600
wanted to say that so much of us have

2162
01:32:15,198 --> 01:32:19,238
been growing and this regenerative

2163
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:21,280
conference is going to be the first time

2164
01:32:19,238 --> 01:32:24,039
that a lot of people are coming out I

2165
01:32:21,279 --> 01:32:28,439
know that the emerald cup was as well

2166
01:32:24,039 --> 01:32:30,639
and you know as we've been uh uptaking

2167
01:32:28,439 --> 01:32:33,599
all of this energy of what's been going

2168
01:32:30,639 --> 01:32:36,880
on in the last two years it forms

2169
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:39,360
secondary metabolites on how we uh

2170
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:41,960
integrate that knowledge and and and

2171
01:32:39,359 --> 01:32:44,079
that nutrition or that toxicity that

2172
01:32:41,960 --> 01:32:48,039
we've been uptaking and I and I really

2173
01:32:44,079 --> 01:32:50,079
want to um encourage people that you

2174
01:32:48,039 --> 01:32:52,118
know that that uptake that we've all

2175
01:32:50,079 --> 01:32:53,479
gotten that the secondary metabolites

2176
01:32:52,118 --> 01:32:55,479
that we're forming which is going to be

2177
01:32:53,479 --> 01:32:59,759
our communication and coming together

2178
01:32:55,479 --> 01:33:03,678
and communing is is is that of Love Is

2179
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:06,280
that of coming together is that of of of

2180
01:33:03,679 --> 01:33:08,440
us really understanding that we've all

2181
01:33:06,279 --> 01:33:11,118
come from incredible hardship of the

2182
01:33:08,439 --> 01:33:12,839
last two years and that the secondary

2183
01:33:11,118 --> 01:33:15,679
metabolites that we're sharing with each

2184
01:33:12,840 --> 01:33:17,880
other from our plants and also from our

2185
01:33:15,679 --> 01:33:20,800
own internal struggles and our own

2186
01:33:17,880 --> 01:33:24,400
internal growth is that of love and

2187
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:27,360
connection and laying down that ego and

2188
01:33:24,399 --> 01:33:29,599
that dogma of what we might have picked

2189
01:33:27,359 --> 01:33:32,198
up within the last two years so that we

2190
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:35,360
can come together because the most

2191
01:33:32,198 --> 01:33:38,079
important thing about all of this is

2192
01:33:35,359 --> 01:33:41,399
that small farmers and regenerative

2193
01:33:38,079 --> 01:33:44,760
people and Educators need to come

2194
01:33:41,399 --> 01:33:46,638
together because this is bigger than us

2195
01:33:44,760 --> 01:33:49,039
this is bigger than diversity it's

2196
01:33:46,639 --> 01:33:51,319
bigger than hip hop it's way bigger than

2197
01:33:49,039 --> 01:33:53,479
hip hop and Hip Hop is Big it's even

2198
01:33:51,319 --> 01:33:56,880
bigger than cannabis because this is

2199
01:33:53,479 --> 01:33:59,000
going to Define small farmers into the

2200
01:33:56,880 --> 01:34:01,118
Next Generation okay we talked lot hang

2201
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:03,399
on and and we have we have to respect

2202
01:34:01,118 --> 01:34:06,039
the polyculture you know and the

2203
01:34:03,399 --> 01:34:08,158
polyculture comes in the Entourage

2204
01:34:06,039 --> 01:34:11,158
effect of our of our medicine and the

2205
01:34:08,158 --> 01:34:13,679
Entourage effect of Us coming together

2206
01:34:11,158 --> 01:34:16,079
we are the Entourage and we didn't and

2207
01:34:13,679 --> 01:34:19,359
we didn't pay off our land with just one

2208
01:34:16,079 --> 01:34:21,559
single source of things we have scrapped

2209
01:34:19,359 --> 01:34:24,158
we have sold Tomatoes we have sold

2210
01:34:21,560 --> 01:34:25,880
strawberries we'

2211
01:34:24,158 --> 01:34:28,479
we've done

2212
01:34:25,880 --> 01:34:30,960
festivals we've done everything we've

2213
01:34:28,479 --> 01:34:33,039
done everything we've trimmed for other

2214
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:35,679
people for Seasons we've done everything

2215
01:34:33,039 --> 01:34:37,800
that we possibly could so that's part of

2216
01:34:35,679 --> 01:34:41,118
the poly culture is what Nick said don't

2217
01:34:37,800 --> 01:34:43,679
get caught up into believing that you're

2218
01:34:41,118 --> 01:34:46,279
just one thing because polyculture is

2219
01:34:43,679 --> 01:34:47,920
going to give us a well-rounded version

2220
01:34:46,279 --> 01:34:51,079
of our best

2221
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:52,719
selves um that just stay on there I

2222
01:34:51,079 --> 01:34:55,319
wanted to ask you I mean that paying off

2223
01:34:52,719 --> 01:34:57,239
your farm that has just that that's my

2224
01:34:55,319 --> 01:34:59,719
big dream is I just feel that's when my

2225
01:34:57,238 --> 01:35:01,238
when my first step of real freedom is

2226
01:34:59,719 --> 01:35:02,600
going to happen you know getting getting

2227
01:35:01,238 --> 01:35:04,039
the property and getting on and getting

2228
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:06,079
use of it and having the contract and

2229
01:35:04,039 --> 01:35:07,800
the bank loan that was a big one but as

2230
01:35:06,079 --> 01:35:09,359
I started developing it's been like this

2231
01:35:07,800 --> 01:35:11,800
ain't my thing someone can take it away

2232
01:35:09,359 --> 01:35:13,439
from me really and um especially that

2233
01:35:11,800 --> 01:35:17,159
that I grow cannabis like they could

2234
01:35:13,439 --> 01:35:18,559
literally take my my loan um but I just

2235
01:35:17,158 --> 01:35:20,158
I just curious about when that not

2236
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:22,039
necessarily when but when that happened

2237
01:35:20,158 --> 01:35:24,719
how that felt and like how you know how

2238
01:35:22,039 --> 01:35:27,840
that transformed I don't know

2239
01:35:24,719 --> 01:35:30,840
well originally we left you know our

2240
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:34,880
area as underground family you know we

2241
01:35:30,840 --> 01:35:37,600
were uh you know refugees and for so for

2242
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:40,199
years we were just you know living at

2243
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:43,239
the herbalist you know the nature life

2244
01:35:40,198 --> 01:35:46,238
and then we figured out hey we can we

2245
01:35:43,238 --> 01:35:48,839
can transform this and and and and bring

2246
01:35:46,238 --> 01:35:50,839
this you know and and get a piece of

2247
01:35:48,840 --> 01:35:52,679
land and did you well I just wanted to

2248
01:35:50,840 --> 01:35:54,440
answer your question is that we just

2249
01:35:52,679 --> 01:35:57,480
paid it off last month

2250
01:35:54,439 --> 01:36:01,638
it was the very last payment we just

2251
01:35:57,479 --> 01:36:04,238
made our last payment January 1

2252
01:36:01,639 --> 01:36:07,159
2022 that's how we came into this New

2253
01:36:04,238 --> 01:36:10,000
Year we're now in our 50s this was a you

2254
01:36:07,158 --> 01:36:12,000

2255
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:15,279
Josh said we've been caretaking other

2256
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:17,319
land renting places and all the we've

2257
01:36:15,279 --> 01:36:20,079
been on this land for 15 years now and

2258
01:36:17,319 --> 01:36:24,158
it's been a 15 years and it's been you

2259
01:36:20,079 --> 01:36:28,679

Freedom we do have a feeling of you

2261
01:36:28,679 --> 01:36:33,600
know mo more than anything because we've

2262
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:36,280
always been Outlaws and because the way

2263
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:39,920
that we look at the world I I have this

2264
01:36:36,279 --> 01:36:41,759
feeling of don't [ __ ] with us I I know

2265
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:43,679
that that sort of is silly but like

2266
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:45,719
given the world it's just like now I

2267
01:36:43,679 --> 01:36:48,960
don't have to talk to anyone I don't

2268
01:36:45,719 --> 01:36:51,000
have to you know it's just it's just now

2269
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:54,039
us and that feels really good well it's

2270
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:57,719
EMP it's empowering because

2271
01:36:54,039 --> 01:37:00,639
you know how we got how we got here so

2272
01:36:57,719 --> 01:37:02,560
now we're here you know and we have this

2273
01:37:00,639 --> 01:37:04,199
land and we have all this infrastructure

2274
01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:06,679
so for the last two years you know you

2275
01:37:04,198 --> 01:37:08,678
say you've been on lockdown but uh and

2276
01:37:06,679 --> 01:37:11,000
there's so many places we can't go you

2277
01:37:08,679 --> 01:37:12,920
know like we're stuck and so we're here

2278
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:15,198
making our land

2279
01:37:12,920 --> 01:37:16,960
spectacular it's kind of a perfect

2280
01:37:15,198 --> 01:37:21,118
situation so we we've made we've turned

2281
01:37:16,960 --> 01:37:22,760
this into a a spectacular opportunity to

2282
01:37:21,118 --> 01:37:23,960
for so many years no one knew what we

2283
01:37:22,760 --> 01:37:25,560
were doing and then we came out and

2284
01:37:23,960 --> 01:37:30,000
started teaching now we're just back

2285
01:37:25,560 --> 01:37:31,600
into our internal just do your craft

2286
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:34,198
like what have you learned who cares

2287
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:36,639
whatever anyone thinks about it do your

2288
01:37:34,198 --> 01:37:39,399
craft that's the teaching and did we

2289
01:37:36,639 --> 01:37:43,599
celebrate no we've been too busy working

2290
01:37:39,399 --> 01:37:45,519
so we is the work done because we paid

2291
01:37:43,599 --> 01:37:47,960
off our land absolutely not it's just

2292
01:37:45,520 --> 01:37:50,159
totally begun because today is a new day

2293
01:37:47,960 --> 01:37:52,198
and and and the thing is in Canada you

2294
01:37:50,158 --> 01:37:54,479
know the Family Farm has never really

2295
01:37:52,198 --> 01:37:56,559
been represented in can Canabis to be

2296
01:37:54,479 --> 01:38:00,079
honest it's been a very corporate thing

2297
01:37:56,560 --> 01:38:01,480
here in Canada and so we in this Zone

2298
01:38:00,079 --> 01:38:03,880
and and other places in Canada we never

2299
01:38:01,479 --> 01:38:05,678
really got to represent ourselves you

2300
01:38:03,880 --> 01:38:07,480
know in the way that people in Oregon

2301
01:38:05,679 --> 01:38:09,399
California other places have so we've

2302
01:38:07,479 --> 01:38:12,598
had to stick with that compassionate

2303
01:38:09,399 --> 01:38:15,960
medicine style you know that that get

2304
01:38:12,599 --> 01:38:18,760
get the medicine to the masses style and

2305
01:38:15,960 --> 01:38:21,719
that that's that's Timeless and and

2306
01:38:18,760 --> 01:38:24,000
nature farming got us here like Nick

2307
01:38:21,719 --> 01:38:26,920
says it's it's what you don't spend that

2308
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:30,158
makes you money and and it's allying

2309
01:38:26,920 --> 01:38:32,560
with nature and nature farming and it's

2310
01:38:30,158 --> 01:38:36,039
that whole realization of

2311
01:38:32,560 --> 01:38:38,000
wow I don't need to spend thousands of

2312
01:38:36,039 --> 01:38:39,920
dollars to start Farm every year I can

2313
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:41,520
just do it in the fall and let nature

2314
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:44,440
take care of it over the winter and wow

2315
01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:46,080

2347
01:39:47,679 --> 01:39:53,399
medicine living soils thank you thank

2348
01:39:50,679 --> 01:39:56,239
you guys so much I uh we're doing a long

2349
01:39:53,399 --> 01:39:57,759
intro but it's really cool and um so I

2350
01:39:56,238 --> 01:40:02,479
want to I want to move on to Stevie

2351
01:39:57,760 --> 01:40:04,599
tricks next next potent ponics um we

2352
01:40:02,479 --> 01:40:07,079
talk actually often so this this is a

2353
01:40:04,599 --> 01:40:09,599
leading question if you

2354
01:40:07,079 --> 01:40:11,000
will um what have you been up to for the

2355
01:40:09,599 --> 01:40:13,440
last two

2356
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:15,238
years been uh since I got back from

2357
01:40:13,439 --> 01:40:17,118
Africa I caught one of the last planes

2358
01:40:15,238 --> 01:40:19,118
out of southern Africa in the middle of

2359
01:40:17,118 --> 01:40:21,399
the plague which was fun it's mostly me

2360
01:40:19,118 --> 01:40:22,439
and Embassy workers uh and then came

2361
01:40:21,399 --> 01:40:23,839
back and I've been just working here in

2362
01:40:22,439 --> 01:40:25,158
Oklahoma with a a bunch of different

2363
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:27,840
people on both living soil and

2364
01:40:25,158 --> 01:40:29,519
aquaponics Farms um for my talk we're

2365
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:32,159
going to be talking a lot about living

2366
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:34,239
aquatic soil and how it can complement

2367
01:40:32,158 --> 01:40:35,799
um your terrestrial soils so how to take

2368
01:40:34,238 --> 01:40:38,439
you know different types of aquatic

2369
01:40:35,800 --> 01:40:40,000
inputs aquatic IMO kind of some

2370
01:40:38,439 --> 01:40:41,919
different methodologies and add it to

2371
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:43,639
your existing soil facility so if you're

2372
01:40:41,920 --> 01:40:45,319
doing regenerative soil and you already

2373
01:40:43,639 --> 01:40:46,359
got your stuff down um this is just

2374
01:40:45,319 --> 01:40:48,639
going to help you increase your

2375
01:40:46,359 --> 01:40:50,439
biodiversity even more um we also have

2376
01:40:48,639 --> 01:40:52,760
some different side by sides and some

2377
01:40:50,439 --> 01:40:54,719
comparisons between tpin and some other

2378
01:40:52,760 --> 01:40:55,920
things with one groups I've been uh

2379
01:40:54,719 --> 01:40:57,439
talking to and working with a little bit

2380
01:40:55,920 --> 01:40:59,199
up in Canada so we'll have some some

2381
01:40:57,439 --> 01:41:01,759
hard data on on those types of things

2382
01:40:59,198 --> 01:41:03,960
with compost so this is compost with and

2383
01:41:01,760 --> 01:41:05,599
without the Aquatic input so you know

2384
01:41:03,960 --> 01:41:07,679
very similar to what people are doing to

2385
01:41:05,599 --> 01:41:09,679
kind of give people more of an idea of

2386
01:41:07,679 --> 01:41:11,960
of a exact comparison to what a lot of

2387
01:41:09,679 --> 01:41:13,840
people are already doing uh out there

2388
01:41:11,960 --> 01:41:15,719
and then we're also going to be talking

2389
01:41:13,840 --> 01:41:17,279
about um a new initiative that I've been

2390
01:41:15,719 --> 01:41:19,920
helping try to put together called open

2391
01:41:17,279 --> 01:41:23,439
nutrient project which is kind of a a

2392
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:25,599
open source aggregated um uh methodology

2393
01:41:23,439 --> 01:41:28,039
for uh having all of the information for

2394
01:41:25,599 --> 01:41:30,279
different plant inputs in one place so

2395
01:41:28,039 --> 01:41:31,880
that people can know for organic inputs

2396
01:41:30,279 --> 01:41:34,880
what plants in their yard they can

2397
01:41:31,880 --> 01:41:36,440
ferment or compost or make into teas or

2398
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:38,840
whatever their methodology that they

2399
01:41:36,439 --> 01:41:40,399
prefer is into one centralized open

2400
01:41:38,840 --> 01:41:42,039
source database that anyone can get

2401
01:41:40,399 --> 01:41:44,399
along with all the different tests and

2402
01:41:42,039 --> 01:41:46,198
whatever else they need to analyze that

2403
01:41:44,399 --> 01:41:47,319
uh and try to break it down to

2404
01:41:46,198 --> 01:41:50,238
understand it in the same way that a lot

2405
01:41:47,319 --> 01:41:52,439
of the the salt people do but for

2406
01:41:50,238 --> 01:41:54,519
specifically ferments and teas and

2407
01:41:52,439 --> 01:41:56,678
organic input the way that all of us are

2408
01:41:54,520 --> 01:41:58,239
are so passionate about so that's uh

2409
01:41:56,679 --> 01:41:59,279
some of the other stuff and then talking

2410
01:41:58,238 --> 01:42:00,919
about a little bit about some of the

2411
01:41:59,279 --> 01:42:02,920
more advanced k&amp;f stuff Chris was

2412
01:42:00,920 --> 01:42:05,399
touching a little bit about the IPO

2413
01:42:02,920 --> 01:42:07,399
which is um utilizing some local um Pest

2414
01:42:05,399 --> 01:42:09,799
Control agents we had a lot of success

2415
01:42:07,399 --> 01:42:11,679
with that in in Zimbabwe and we're

2416
01:42:09,800 --> 01:42:14,159
excited to talk about uh that and share

2417
01:42:11,679 --> 01:42:16,118
that methodology with people um as well

2418
01:42:14,158 --> 01:42:17,559
as um just some of the other different

2419
01:42:16,118 --> 01:42:19,198
things I've been working on in terms of

2420
01:42:17,560 --> 01:42:20,560
refinement on on some of the other

2421
01:42:19,198 --> 01:42:22,799
things we're going to go over um the

2422
01:42:20,560 --> 01:42:24,239
blue Labs which is the FICO and isolates

2423
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:25,880
and some of the other really cool

2424
01:42:24,238 --> 01:42:27,399
organic inputs that we've been tinkering

2425
01:42:25,880 --> 01:42:29,520
with that are kind of building Upon A

2426
01:42:27,399 --> 01:42:31,960
lot of the great work that um a lot of

2427
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:33,920
the uh the previous uh uh people in the

2428
01:42:31,960 --> 01:42:35,800
organic space have helped us give us a

2429
01:42:33,920 --> 01:42:38,440
wonderful foundation on kind of and then

2430
01:42:35,800 --> 01:42:40,039
iterating upon that and and U you know

2431
01:42:38,439 --> 01:42:42,198
adding a whole bunch of new twists and

2432
01:42:40,039 --> 01:42:43,960
turns to uh that methodology so I'm

2433
01:42:42,198 --> 01:42:45,439
super excited about that and super

2434
01:42:43,960 --> 01:42:48,158
excited to share a lot of this stuff for

2435
01:42:45,439 --> 01:42:51,879
the first time with

2436
01:42:48,158 --> 01:42:54,158
people he just [ __ ] like boom half of

2437
01:42:51,880 --> 01:42:57,079
those things I kind of understand and

2438
01:42:54,158 --> 01:42:59,559
and uh Steve goes deep he's really deep

2439
01:42:57,079 --> 01:43:00,920
into all this stuff and it's uh it's

2440
01:42:59,560 --> 01:43:03,360
something that you're you're a very

2441
01:43:00,920 --> 01:43:06,440
unique individual and how you deep dive

2442
01:43:03,359 --> 01:43:08,439
and I appreciate it and um he he's he's

2443
01:43:06,439 --> 01:43:10,439
had a great talk Steve has been at uh

2444
01:43:08,439 --> 01:43:12,678
every one of

2445
01:43:10,439 --> 01:43:17,039
these you miss all them except for the

2446
01:43:12,679 --> 01:43:17,039
ones in Africa yeah yeah and

2447
01:43:20,238 --> 01:43:24,678
um the Deep dive you take like I said

2448
01:43:22,520 --> 01:43:26,880
I'm just going to repeat myself um into

2449
01:43:24,679 --> 01:43:28,480
all this stuff and I'm excited to hear

2450
01:43:26,880 --> 01:43:29,800
your your iterations on that I know we

2451
01:43:28,479 --> 01:43:32,039
spent a lot of time talking about

2452
01:43:29,800 --> 01:43:34,039
terrestrial and Aquatic microbes and and

2453
01:43:32,039 --> 01:43:36,880
you help me figure out my system and

2454
01:43:34,039 --> 01:43:38,719
dial it in and and kind of build build

2455
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:40,880
upon it and so it's it's been really

2456
01:43:38,719 --> 01:43:43,079
really awesome man so I want to

2457
01:43:40,880 --> 01:43:44,880
introduce a best friend farms uh I think

2458
01:43:43,079 --> 01:43:47,639
we've we've spoken or at least I've seen

2459
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:50,480
you on hash Church before um maybe not

2460
01:43:47,639 --> 01:43:52,079
officially we've met but what's up bro

2461
01:43:50,479 --> 01:43:54,399
how you doing how you doing nice to see

2462
01:43:52,079 --> 01:43:57,238
you nice to meet I I think I've seen you

2463
01:43:54,399 --> 01:43:59,238
there a couple once or twice too you w

2464
01:43:57,238 --> 01:44:01,959
to just introduce yourself and what you

2465
01:43:59,238 --> 01:44:04,399
got going on you're in Maine yeah oh

2466
01:44:01,960 --> 01:44:08,439
yeah yeah I'm up in Maine it's pretty

2467
01:44:04,399 --> 01:44:10,479
cold here right now um got a well I have

2468
01:44:08,439 --> 01:44:12,919
a larger Acreage Farm but I've got about

2469
01:44:10,479 --> 01:44:18,000
10 acres working it was a clearcut when

2470
01:44:12,920 --> 01:44:20,079
we came in and have actually the water

2471
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:22,238
conversation's pretty cool cuz Maine has

2472
01:44:20,079 --> 01:44:23,960
such good such volume of water and

2473
01:44:22,238 --> 01:44:27,079
really good water

2474
01:44:23,960 --> 01:44:29,520
and it's something that on this land was

2475
01:44:27,079 --> 01:44:32,279
like one of the key factors as Josh and

2476
01:44:29,520 --> 01:44:33,920
Kelly were saying with you know with or

2477
01:44:32,279 --> 01:44:36,279
as far as how important it is to the

2478
01:44:33,920 --> 01:44:39,560
land and the whole conversation you guys

2479
01:44:36,279 --> 01:44:40,519
are having around water so water was

2480
01:44:39,560 --> 01:44:43,760
kind of

2481
01:44:40,520 --> 01:44:46,639
a uh Central Focus here where we have a

2482
01:44:43,760 --> 01:44:50,400
good well and it goes deep but I've also

2483
01:44:46,639 --> 01:44:52,440
dug a couple ponds which um I don't know

2484
01:44:50,399 --> 01:44:54,638
not to go on on but if it's on the water

2485
01:44:52,439 --> 01:44:56,598
topic it's we've actually drawn some of

2486
01:44:54,639 --> 01:44:59,118
the water away from the Cannabis site

2487
01:44:56,599 --> 01:45:01,239
where we are because Maine has so much

2488
01:44:59,118 --> 01:45:03,679
ambient water that I've drained off of

2489
01:45:01,238 --> 01:45:06,759
the medical cannabis portion which is

2490
01:45:03,679 --> 01:45:10,760
about a 10,000 to 15,000 square foot

2491
01:45:06,760 --> 01:45:13,480
portion all in all um for the area and

2492
01:45:10,760 --> 01:45:15,800
on each North and South I've pulled off

2493
01:45:13,479 --> 01:45:18,959
the water kind of sailed in and drained

2494
01:45:15,800 --> 01:45:21,719
off coming into it so um yeah just

2495
01:45:18,960 --> 01:45:23,599
wanted to let you know you know we're

2496
01:45:21,719 --> 01:45:25,679
we're taking water and importantly and

2497
01:45:23,599 --> 01:45:27,920
and trying to work with it here where we

2498
01:45:25,679 --> 01:45:30,399
actually have so much of it and are

2499
01:45:27,920 --> 01:45:32,760
blessed by so much water that I'm trying

2500
01:45:30,399 --> 01:45:36,158
to kind of you know collect it and drain

2501
01:45:32,760 --> 01:45:38,360
off but anyhow hey that's the same thing

2502
01:45:36,158 --> 01:45:41,839
I'm doing man I I'm in a really wet

2503
01:45:38,359 --> 01:45:46,598
space half there's a I have 10 acres and

2504
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:48,920
at least uh two of those is is Wetlands

2505
01:45:46,599 --> 01:45:51,159
but where my cannabis disability is not

2506
01:45:48,920 --> 01:45:52,639
but um it's still very wet and I've had

2507
01:45:51,158 --> 01:45:55,039
to make I've had to actually had to make

2508
01:45:52,639 --> 01:45:56,440
Road so that I can get through and with

2509
01:45:55,039 --> 01:45:58,000
my tractor that I purchased and just

2510
01:45:56,439 --> 01:46:00,439
equipment so we can process because it's

2511
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:01,719
like even the areas where I where I have

2512
01:46:00,439 --> 01:46:03,678
to walk to my towards my shipping

2513
01:46:01,719 --> 01:46:06,439
container it's all mud like I can't even

2514
01:46:03,679 --> 01:46:08,599
wear you know um clogs or anything you

2515
01:46:06,439 --> 01:46:10,079
have to so it's it's I've really learned

2516
01:46:08,599 --> 01:46:12,480
about that I've actually Dug Dug a

2517
01:46:10,079 --> 01:46:14,079
couple ponds and I've built a filtration

2518
01:46:12,479 --> 01:46:15,598
system where I'm filtering the water and

2519
01:46:14,079 --> 01:46:17,559
collecting it off all my Greenhouse

2520
01:46:15,599 --> 01:46:20,000
spaces and my house and every roof and

2521
01:46:17,560 --> 01:46:22,400
everything drains all into this Pond

2522
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:24,079
system that I that I'm now kind of my

2523
01:46:22,399 --> 01:46:26,158
property is Hill and it slop so I'm

2524
01:46:24,079 --> 01:46:28,158
going to continue these ponds uphill and

2525
01:46:26,158 --> 01:46:29,598
I'll just kind of slowly trickle it

2526
01:46:28,158 --> 01:46:34,000
through them all so they're all moving

2527
01:46:29,599 --> 01:46:36,079
and and I'm shooting for um I think 500

2528
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:37,719
some thousand gallons of water storage

2529
01:46:36,079 --> 01:46:41,039
that I that'll get me through the four

2530
01:46:37,719 --> 01:46:42,719
months of you know just kind of this big

2531
01:46:41,039 --> 01:46:44,319
dream if I maxed it all out and blew it

2532
01:46:42,719 --> 01:46:46,198
all the hell wherever you know and I

2533
01:46:44,319 --> 01:46:49,238
just kind of want to have this like

2534
01:46:46,198 --> 01:46:50,799
super powerful H water system that I can

2535
01:46:49,238 --> 01:46:54,319
you know rely

2536
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:56,679
on but

2537
01:46:54,319 --> 01:46:59,840
dream you got your dream for your water

2538
01:46:56,679 --> 01:47:01,719
system that that was definitely um I was

2539
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:04,360
the last five years before I moved back

2540
01:47:01,719 --> 01:47:06,520
here now for five I was off the grid up

2541
01:47:04,359 --> 01:47:09,359
in well in southern humble and we were

2542
01:47:06,520 --> 01:47:12,400
just uh pulling gravity fed water there

2543
01:47:09,359 --> 01:47:14,598
the whole time so kind of got familiar

2544
01:47:12,399 --> 01:47:16,879
with water from the hills without a

2545
01:47:14,599 --> 01:47:19,360
system and then moved back to Maine it

2546
01:47:16,880 --> 01:47:21,520
was like this huge blessing besides the

2547
01:47:19,359 --> 01:47:23,639
peace and the freedom out here it's

2548
01:47:21,520 --> 01:47:26,599
pretty isolated but the water blessing

2549
01:47:23,639 --> 01:47:29,079
is just just you know water everywhere

2550
01:47:26,599 --> 01:47:31,319
so it became kind of one of those things

2551
01:47:29,079 --> 01:47:34,439
like move from back you know back from

2552
01:47:31,319 --> 01:47:36,359
west to east again that were trying to

2553
01:47:34,439 --> 01:47:38,479
you know work with the water and build

2554
01:47:36,359 --> 01:47:40,598
the water dream here too I got this

2555
01:47:38,479 --> 01:47:42,959
little you know kind of dream going

2556
01:47:40,599 --> 01:47:45,440
where I could actually pasture pump out

2557
01:47:42,960 --> 01:47:47,560
with a solar P you know uh inversion

2558
01:47:45,439 --> 01:47:49,839
into even a little bank and then I've

2559
01:47:47,560 --> 01:47:52,000
got enough drop of like 20 or 30 feet

2560
01:47:49,840 --> 01:47:54,440
with this rock staircase waterfall

2561
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:56,719

2570
01:48:11,279 --> 01:48:16,519

2571
01:48:14,238 --> 01:48:18,879
I'd like to aate the pond you know get

2572
01:48:16,520 --> 01:48:21,960
some brook trout in there with some we

2573
01:48:18,880 --> 01:48:23,639
just put shiners in actually in the

2574
01:48:21,960 --> 01:48:25,760
trying to set the

2575
01:48:23,639 --> 01:48:28,039
you know to get the ecosystem in the

2576
01:48:25,760 --> 01:48:29,719
pond too not just for use for

2577
01:48:28,039 --> 01:48:32,920
agriculture but where we have like a

2578
01:48:29,719 --> 01:48:35,599
habitat and ecosystem even some food

2579
01:48:32,920 --> 01:48:38,319
that could come out of it so I was

2580
01:48:35,599 --> 01:48:40,079
actually kind of wondering if anyone oh

2581
01:48:38,319 --> 01:48:41,359
oh no go ahead I I was just gonna ask I

2582
01:48:40,079 --> 01:48:42,960
just heard that you were recently Dem

2583
01:48:41,359 --> 01:48:46,319
Pier certified so I was just GNA ask

2584
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:49,639
about that process and you know who came

2585
01:48:46,319 --> 01:48:49,639
out and yeah you know share

2586
01:48:49,840 --> 01:48:54,960
about talking to Josh and Kelly for gez

2587
01:48:53,238 --> 01:48:58,079
over a couple years and then this

2588
01:48:54,960 --> 01:49:00,239
pandemic thing kind of happened so um I

2589
01:48:58,079 --> 01:49:02,118
haven't got to show them the land which

2590
01:49:00,238 --> 01:49:04,000
would be probably you know what I would

2591
01:49:02,118 --> 01:49:05,679
love to do the most is be able to show

2592
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:08,679
those folks you know what we got going

2593
01:49:05,679 --> 01:49:10,880
here and get some feedback and such but

2594
01:49:08,679 --> 01:49:13,880
um I've worked with ancient Green Farm

2595
01:49:10,880 --> 01:49:15,719
out here quite a bit and they've both

2596
01:49:13,880 --> 01:49:17,920
been out here Bobby you know a lot I've

2597
01:49:15,719 --> 01:49:20,279
seen him even in the last month or so so

2598
01:49:17,920 --> 01:49:22,760
we've over the last few years um he

2599
01:49:20,279 --> 01:49:24,519
became pretty familiar with my farm and

2600
01:49:22,760 --> 01:49:26,400
and then we talked about it there a lot

2601
01:49:24,520 --> 01:49:29,440
too and again the last couple years were

2602
01:49:26,399 --> 01:49:31,359
so fast that uh I just recently right

2603

shop that's going on here so I'm I'm

2636
01:50:59,679 --> 01:51:03,118
doing some hash but it's more

2637
01:51:01,078 --> 01:51:05,479
traditional and I know these guys are

2638
01:51:03,118 --> 01:51:07,880
into the full melt stuff and you know I

2639
01:51:05,479 --> 01:51:07,879
have some

2640
01:51:20,118 --> 01:51:24,279
Ro you look like you want Mar to pop in

2641
01:51:22,719 --> 01:51:26,439
just we can open it up the discussion I

2642
01:51:24,279 --> 01:51:28,639
just wanted to introduce everybody and

2643
01:51:26,439 --> 01:51:30,319
you know this this kind of thing was was

2644
01:51:28,639 --> 01:51:32,760
is is somewhat intended to be a little

2645
01:51:30,319 --> 01:51:34,960
bit of a marketing for the conference

2646
01:51:32,760 --> 01:51:36,880
and uh I don't mind doing it because I

2647
01:51:34,960 --> 01:51:39,639
do feel that that it is kind of a

2648
01:51:36,880 --> 01:51:42,000
nonprofit thing that that we're the

2649
01:51:39,639 --> 01:51:44,078
content is so good and and I'm not doing

2650
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:45,760
it to make a buck and um so I kind of

2651
01:51:44,078 --> 01:51:48,639
really just appreciate uh you know

2652
01:51:45,760 --> 01:51:49,880
Marcus given the space and and I just

2653
01:51:48,639 --> 01:51:51,840
also kind of feel guilty when I'm

2654
01:51:49,880 --> 01:51:54,880
marketing like I I just so against it

2655
01:51:51,840 --> 01:51:57,039
but I you know I'm kind of justifying so

2656
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:59,239
anyways I want a bunch of people to come

2657
01:51:57,039 --> 01:52:01,519

2659
01:52:01,520 --> 01:52:06,320

2660
01:52:03,880 --> 01:52:08,078
the thing really has been uh you know a

2661
01:52:06,319 --> 01:52:10,158
powerful part of my life and I'm I'm

2672
01:52:30,039 --> 01:52:34,560
cannabis but vegetables I know there was

2673
01:52:31,719 --> 01:52:36,880
a guy that gave me some pre um Civil War

2674
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:38,520
era like okra seeds that are super

2675
01:52:36,880 --> 01:52:40,440
amazing that I've been keeping going and

2676
01:52:38,520 --> 01:52:42,199
breeding out as well and whole bunch of

2677
01:52:40,439 --> 01:52:43,399
other just amazing vegetable and herbal

2678
01:52:42,198 --> 01:52:45,960
genetics that people are willing to

2679
01:52:43,399 --> 01:52:48,238
share um so definitely bring seeds to

2680
01:52:45,960 --> 01:52:49,399
share if you are coming out um and and

2681
01:52:48,238 --> 01:52:51,000
you know you'll get a whole bunch of

2682
01:52:49,399 --> 01:52:53,719
wonderful ones in return um just

2683
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:55,479
remember like a ziplocks and Sharpies

2684
01:52:53,719 --> 01:52:58,679
because there never seems to be enough

2685
01:52:55,479 --> 01:53:01,198
of those don't write Sharpies on a

2686
01:52:58,679 --> 01:53:03,039
Ziploc it you end up getting home and

2687
01:53:01,198 --> 01:53:06,919
going what the [ __ ]

2688
01:53:03,039 --> 01:53:09,238
kush you'd like I have boxes and boxes

2689
01:53:06,920 --> 01:53:10,840
of seeds that I don't know what they are

2690
01:53:09,238 --> 01:53:12,799
I'm I [ __ ] you not like I've started my

2691
01:53:10,840 --> 01:53:15,360
seed company off of the gifts during

2692
01:53:12,800 --> 01:53:17,480
these seed swaps it's it's absolutely

2693
01:53:15,359 --> 01:53:19,839
amazing I've got to look through a ton

2694
01:53:17,479 --> 01:53:21,959
of stuff and um but I do have a ton of

2695
01:53:19,840 --> 01:53:23,840
stuff that I'm like damn maybe someday

2696
01:53:21,960 --> 01:53:25,118
I'll open it but if I don't know I don't

2697
01:53:23,840 --> 01:53:27,639
know it's just kind of one of those

2698
01:53:25,118 --> 01:53:30,000
things so I suggest riding on a card

2699
01:53:27,639 --> 01:53:33,520
inside a Ziploc or you know just kind of

2700
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:36,880
think through how that works but in that

2701
01:53:33,520 --> 01:53:39,280
same uh notion like I I came up with a

2702
01:53:36,880 --> 01:53:41,480
concept talking with Kev one day he had

2703
01:53:39,279 --> 01:53:43,399
gifted me um some chem dog Special

2704
01:53:41,479 --> 01:53:46,359
Reserve root beer seeds or root beer

2705
01:53:43,399 --> 01:53:48,879
chem dog Special Reserve seeds and um I

2706
01:53:46,359 --> 01:53:51,198
opened them up and found a couple killer

2707
01:53:48,880 --> 01:53:53,440
females that were just they they held

2708
01:53:51,198 --> 01:53:56,198
through the first or second week of

2709
01:53:53,439 --> 01:53:58,919
November here and we had a gnarly wet

2710
01:53:56,198 --> 01:54:00,919
year a gnarly gnarly wet year rained all

2711
01:53:58,920 --> 01:54:02,920
all it was cold and they they hung

2712
01:54:00,920 --> 01:54:05,199
through with with you know no mold

2713
01:54:02,920 --> 01:54:06,719
issues and they they kind of represented

2714
01:54:05,198 --> 01:54:09,879
the two ends of the spectrum one the

2715
01:54:06,719 --> 01:54:11,760
chem dog one the root beer and so I

2716
01:54:09,880 --> 01:54:13,440
pulled a couple males and I'm I'm open

2717
01:54:11,760 --> 01:54:15,679
pollinating those right now in a in in

2718
01:54:13,439 --> 01:54:17,198
an indoor space and um along with the

2719
01:54:15,679 --> 01:54:18,639
with the purchase of the conference

2720
01:54:17,198 --> 01:54:21,039
ticket everyone's getting a pack of

2721
01:54:18,639 --> 01:54:23,480
these seeds um and it's where the

2722
01:54:21,039 --> 01:54:27,198
attempt is to do kind of Regional group

2723
01:54:23,479 --> 01:54:28,959
breeding project um and so you know we

2724
01:54:27,198 --> 01:54:31,118
kind of have the humble California area

2725
01:54:28,960 --> 01:54:33,880
we got the Michigan the Maine and

2726
01:54:31,118 --> 01:54:35,559
Oklahoma and we're gonna you know I'm

2727
01:54:33,880 --> 01:54:36,960
I'm working on organizing honestly I've

2728
01:54:35,560 --> 01:54:38,960
been very busy I thought I'd have it

2729
01:54:36,960 --> 01:54:40,920
organized on by now but I want to get

2730
01:54:38,960 --> 01:54:43,279
each of those regions into a social

2731
01:54:40,920 --> 01:54:44,840
media area where we can do group voting

2732
01:54:43,279 --> 01:54:46,759
you know we'll grow all the seeds out

2733
01:54:44,840 --> 01:54:48,719
people will test they'll make hash do

2734
01:54:46,760 --> 01:54:50,119
all the things that we do and and around

2735
01:54:48,719 --> 01:54:51,800
this time next year we'll get together

2736
01:54:50,118 --> 01:54:54,679
on social media and kind of work through

2737
01:54:51,800 --> 01:54:56,440
and say okay in the Humbolt region um

2738
01:54:54,679 --> 01:54:58,039
kev's Kev pulled a couple couple killer

2739
01:54:56,439 --> 01:54:59,678
males and they got this and that and we

2740
01:54:58,039 --> 01:55:02,238
all decided we want to use his males and

2741
01:54:59,679 --> 01:55:04,840
Eric found a cool female and so hey you

2742
01:55:02,238 --> 01:55:06,879
two guys do this project and maybe you

2743
01:55:04,840 --> 01:55:08,719
know maybe Nicholas will will actually

2744
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:11,118
do the breeding and you know and then we

2745
01:55:08,719 --> 01:55:13,198
can can even take that further and

2746
01:55:11,118 --> 01:55:15,078
structure it I want to incorporate

2747
01:55:13,198 --> 01:55:16,919
technology in the blockchain so that we

2748
01:55:15,078 --> 01:55:19,559
can incorporate a payment structure so

2749
01:55:16,920 --> 01:55:22,078
that people um that do the work can get

2750
01:55:19,560 --> 01:55:24,199
paid as we end up selling these seeds um

2751
01:55:22,078 --> 01:55:26,759
and everyone that that that took part in

2752
01:55:24,198 --> 01:55:29,399
the conference will also potentially get

2753
01:55:26,760 --> 01:55:32,239
dividend back down the line so I kind of

2754
01:55:29,399 --> 01:55:34,719
broke it out and uh a very simple sales

2755
01:55:32,238 --> 01:55:37,000
plan uh two years from now you could get

2756
01:55:34,719 --> 01:55:39,840
paid back your your ticket purchase just

2757
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:41,359
through participating in this process

2758
01:55:39,840 --> 01:55:43,639
and um I think it's really cool and

2759
01:55:41,359 --> 01:55:44,960
it'll be really fun and um you know big

2760
01:55:43,639 --> 01:55:46,960
thanks to Kev for kind of helping

2761
01:55:44,960 --> 01:55:49,800
inspire that you know and gifting the

2762
01:55:46,960 --> 01:55:51,158
seeds that we get to do this with um if

2763
01:55:49,800 --> 01:55:53,679
you don't if you guys don't know root

2764
01:55:51,158 --> 01:55:55,839
beer is uh mean jeene from

2765
01:55:53,679 --> 01:55:58,399
mesino um and the chem dog Special

2766
01:55:55,840 --> 01:56:00,960
Reserve is from a fici andado that Leo

2767
01:55:58,399 --> 01:56:03,238
had and so Leo gifted the pollen to Jean

2768
01:56:00,960 --> 01:56:05,719
and Jean made these seeds and gifted

2769
01:56:03,238 --> 01:56:08,598
them to Kev and he held on to them for a

2770
01:56:05,719 --> 01:56:10,039
while and the chem dog you know K Kev

2771
01:56:08,599 --> 01:56:11,840
you could probably talk about the chem

2772
01:56:10,039 --> 01:56:15,238
dog a little bit more than I could to be

2773
01:56:11,840 --> 01:56:18,319
honest yeah the um the seeds are B

2774
01:56:15,238 --> 01:56:19,638
probably I don't know eight years old so

2775
01:56:18,319 --> 01:56:22,000
it was back when they all rolled

2776
01:56:19,639 --> 01:56:24,239
together as a crew and they gave me the

2777
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:26,319
St and I just put it away and then years

2778
01:56:24,238 --> 01:56:28,158
later when root beer gets blistering hot

2779
01:56:26,319 --> 01:56:30,279
I went through my collection I I I

2780
01:56:28,158 --> 01:56:32,439
remembered I had something connected to

2781
01:56:30,279 --> 01:56:33,960
it and we just thought you know you and

2782
01:56:32,439 --> 01:56:36,799
I Josh and I were talking about you know

2783
01:56:33,960 --> 01:56:38,800
how do we add value to the regen and and

2784
01:56:36,800 --> 01:56:41,440
how do you connect people into a

2785
01:56:38,800 --> 01:56:44,320
collaborative project that allows many

2786
01:56:41,439 --> 01:56:47,678
people to work together to find common

2787
01:56:44,319 --> 01:56:50,840
benefit and so when you tap into lines

2788
01:56:47,679 --> 01:56:53,599
that have a heavy traction it's a lot

2789
01:56:50,840 --> 01:56:55,880
easier and and the main point is that

2790
01:56:53,599 --> 01:56:58,119
you get to have people work together

2791
01:56:55,880 --> 01:57:00,880
sifting stock doing collaborative

2792
01:56:58,118 --> 01:57:02,799
breeding and that root beer is the first

2793
01:57:00,880 --> 01:57:05,000
gen root beer it's not the subsequent

2794
01:57:02,800 --> 01:57:07,679
Generations that's the original one so

2795
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:10,238
there's nobody with that plant in seed

2796
01:57:07,679 --> 01:57:11,599
form I mean it's that old yeah every

2797
01:57:10,238 --> 01:57:14,959
every everything that's been released

2798
01:57:11,599 --> 01:57:17,119
root beer is is a cross a bx2 a bx3 this

2799
01:57:14,960 --> 01:57:19,560
is the original one that's the original

2800
01:57:17,118 --> 01:57:21,319
one so it's and and and so and Jean

2801
01:57:19,560 --> 01:57:23,360
knows too so like for me you know when I

2802
01:57:21,319 --> 01:57:25,039
grab your jeans if you want me to put

2803
01:57:23,359 --> 01:57:27,479
him in the market I do and if you don't

2804
01:57:25,039 --> 01:57:29,319
I don't it's just it's just really

2805
01:57:27,479 --> 01:57:31,519
respect to the individual so I mean I

2806
01:57:29,319 --> 01:57:35,679
move jeans continuously but I don't step

2807
01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:37,159
on anybody's toes and so with Jean um

2808
01:57:35,679 --> 01:57:39,560
you know he's about it because it's a

2809
01:57:37,158 --> 01:57:42,879
good project and that chem dog special

2810
01:57:39,560 --> 01:57:47,599
was a a project they did up in in

2811
01:57:42,880 --> 01:57:51,078
mesino and it was um a star dog I want

2812
01:57:47,599 --> 01:57:53,078
to say star dog like KMD and and it's

2813
01:57:51,078 --> 01:57:55,000
controversial in all it's little

2814
01:57:53,078 --> 01:57:56,840
permutations and how it all happened but

2815
01:57:55,000 --> 01:58:00,439
the main point is that chem dog special

2816
01:57:56,840 --> 01:58:03,760
line was some really good herb and I had

2817
01:58:00,439 --> 01:58:08,399
the female that won that 2012 Cup in

2818
01:58:03,760 --> 01:58:09,880
hand and uh Ellie and Leo had the male

2819
01:58:08,399 --> 01:58:11,439
and then they took the pollen and threw

2820
01:58:09,880 --> 01:58:14,880
it on it and the problem with the chem

2821
01:58:11,439 --> 01:58:17,439
dog special is it's so dominant in its

2822
01:58:14,880 --> 01:58:20,118
profile that it masks a lot of the stuff

2823
01:58:17,439 --> 01:58:22,158
you hit it with so you have to be able

2824
01:58:20,118 --> 01:58:25,039
to make sure you do a large enough

2825
01:58:22,158 --> 01:58:29,519
population hunt to get what you want

2826
01:58:25,039 --> 01:58:32,760
which is that gas tone but with other

2827
01:58:29,520 --> 01:58:34,480
nuances from the female present so the

2828
01:58:32,760 --> 01:58:36,280
black lime Reserve if you look through

2829
01:58:34,479 --> 01:58:38,439
the population you'll pull out the right

2830
01:58:36,279 --> 01:58:41,198
ones that have the lime that's intense

2831
01:58:38,439 --> 01:58:43,238
but still has that gaseous background

2832
01:58:41,198 --> 01:58:44,799
and I think the same with the root bear

2833
01:58:43,238 --> 01:58:46,519
is that you just have to go through and

2834
01:58:44,800 --> 01:58:48,000
I'm glad that when you open the pack you

2835
01:58:46,520 --> 01:58:50,760
found some Killers I think you said you

2836
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:52,719
got one that was like like vanilla soda

2837
01:58:50,760 --> 01:58:55,199
yeah one that was total vanilla soda

2838
01:58:52,719 --> 01:58:56,399
and really interesting yeah but the M

2839
01:58:55,198 --> 01:58:59,118
it's it's the same thing it's just

2840
01:58:56,399 --> 01:59:01,679
trying to you got to tie the people

2841
01:58:59,118 --> 01:59:03,439
together in a way to where you really

2842
01:59:01,679 --> 01:59:05,399
you form community community is a

2843
01:59:03,439 --> 01:59:07,598
[ __ ] great word but what does it mean

2844
01:59:05,399 --> 01:59:09,839
it means collaborative effort and

2845
01:59:07,599 --> 01:59:11,560
support and that's what a community is

2846
01:59:09,840 --> 01:59:13,279
it's where people put effort in and and

2847
01:59:11,560 --> 01:59:17,000
support each other and do your best you

2848
01:59:13,279 --> 01:59:18,639
can to to be a human race and so the

2849
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:20,880
idea of like letting the regen

2850
01:59:18,639 --> 01:59:22,920
conference be a place where people can

2851
01:59:20,880 --> 01:59:25,719
get together to do project s that

2852
01:59:22,920 --> 01:59:28,760
transcend time so in two years you'll

2853
01:59:25,719 --> 01:59:31,359
see the the ramifications of that

2854
01:59:28,760 --> 01:59:33,599
project and then I did another one too

2855
01:59:31,359 --> 01:59:35,238
where I was able to access a bunch of

2856
01:59:33,599 --> 01:59:37,599
stock out of

2857
01:59:35,238 --> 01:59:39,158
Afghanistan and I I talked to the group

2858
01:59:37,599 --> 01:59:41,039
in Afghanistan and said hey what I want

2859
01:59:39,158 --> 01:59:43,359
to do is I want to take it I'll do a

2860
01:59:41,039 --> 01:59:45,760
selection I'll do a pollination and then

2861
01:59:43,359 --> 01:59:47,639
I want to give the seeds out for free in

2862
01:59:45,760 --> 01:59:50,000
limited quantities so that people can

2863
01:59:47,639 --> 01:59:53,359
access the stock and what it does it

2864
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:56,118
drives attention to Farmer was in

2865
01:59:53,359 --> 01:59:58,118
Afghanistan and it's funny but I got hit

2866
01:59:56,118 --> 02:00:01,198
up by an Afghani guy that was telling me

2867
01:59:58,118 --> 02:00:03,519
I was a [ __ ] like a colonialist and I

2868
02:00:01,198 --> 02:00:05,759
was screwing the afghanis by giving

2869
02:00:03,520 --> 02:00:07,719
these seeds away and I'm like but it was

2870
02:00:05,760 --> 02:00:09,400
afghanis that sent me the seed and it

2871
02:00:07,719 --> 02:00:12,198
was afghanis that told me to give them

2872
02:00:09,399 --> 02:00:15,078
away but it's a question of how do you

2873
02:00:12,198 --> 02:00:17,598
send value back to the farmers because

2874
02:00:15,078 --> 02:00:19,000
they're in the same situation we're in

2875
02:00:17,599 --> 02:00:20,760
and so we're trying to figure out you

2876
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:22,920
know how do you really Drive attention

2877
02:00:20,760 --> 02:00:24,960
to people who are struggling

2878
02:00:22,920 --> 02:00:27,639
and allow there to be benefit in a world

2879
02:00:24,960 --> 02:00:29,359
that's really difficult to do but at

2880
02:00:27,639 --> 02:00:32,800
least what we'll do is we'll take these

2881
02:00:29,359 --> 02:00:34,359
uh Z Afghani lines and I'll I'll give

2882
02:00:32,800 --> 02:00:36,920
packs of them out at at the four

2883
02:00:34,359 --> 02:00:38,960
different shows and it just lets people

2884
02:00:36,920 --> 02:00:40,679
access stock it's like 200 bucks a pack

2885
02:00:38,960 --> 02:00:42,399
if you bought them but I'm I'm gonna

2886
02:00:40,679 --> 02:00:44,000
give out you know like 20 packs at each

2887
02:00:42,399 --> 02:00:46,319
event and what it'll do is it'll allow

2888
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:48,599
people to get really good stock that you

2889
02:00:46,319 --> 02:00:50,279
can't access and it should allow people

2890
02:00:48,599 --> 02:00:52,639
to do two things it should allow you to

2891
02:00:50,279 --> 02:00:55,399
do preservation where you keep the line

2892
02:00:52,639 --> 02:00:57,279
pure so that what you have is you have

2893
02:00:55,399 --> 02:00:58,960
the connection to the past and then

2894
02:00:57,279 --> 02:01:01,158
outcross it which is what I've been

2895
02:00:58,960 --> 02:01:03,880
playing around with in addition to bring

2896
02:01:01,158 --> 02:01:07,359
some of those unique profiles

2897
02:01:03,880 --> 02:01:09,239
and uh cannaboid ratios into modern

2898
02:01:07,359 --> 02:01:11,000
cultivar so that you get rid of some of

2899
02:01:09,238 --> 02:01:13,638
this blandness that's happening in the

2900
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:16,960
quality of the high we're we're we're

2901
02:01:13,639 --> 02:01:19,440
driving cannabis for morphological

2902
02:01:16,960 --> 02:01:21,599
traits we drive it for numerical traits

2903
02:01:19,439 --> 02:01:22,879
we drive it for a lot of [ __ ] but I

2904
02:01:21,599 --> 02:01:25,279
don't really don't care about any of

2905
02:01:22,880 --> 02:01:27,159
that I mean I I do for the market but in

2906
02:01:25,279 --> 02:01:29,000
terms of what I want for cannabis what I

2907
02:01:27,158 --> 02:01:32,839
want is I want really good cannabis that

2908
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:34,760
lifts me up I want to feel it and I

2909
02:01:32,840 --> 02:01:36,560
think that you know the the ability for

2910
02:01:34,760 --> 02:01:39,239
all of us to to work together in this

2911
02:01:36,560 --> 02:01:39,239
form is just

2912
02:01:41,198 --> 02:01:45,279
awesome I just wanted to say really

2913
02:01:43,479 --> 02:01:47,718
quick that one of the most potent

2914
02:01:45,279 --> 02:01:51,639
strains we grew this year was a Tangi

2915
02:01:47,719 --> 02:01:53,560
land chem Special Reserve number four

2916
02:01:51,639 --> 02:01:55,800
and the Kevin Special Reserve number

2917
02:01:53,560 --> 02:01:58,599
four not sure where it came from but it

2918
02:01:55,800 --> 02:02:01,320
was came from me was it yeah yeah that's

2919
02:01:58,599 --> 02:02:03,560
the mail I put in yeah the number four

2920
02:02:01,319 --> 02:02:06,118
and it's true that that every we grew a

2921
02:02:03,560 --> 02:02:08,920
bunch of different chem Special Reserve

2922
02:02:06,118 --> 02:02:11,078
number four because we had there was a a

2923
02:02:08,920 --> 02:02:13,719
person in Eugene up in Oregon who grew

2924
02:02:11,078 --> 02:02:16,759
it and uh made some seeds out of it and

2925
02:02:13,719 --> 02:02:20,118
it it does dominate the profile but the

2926
02:02:16,760 --> 02:02:24,280
way Tangi dominates the profile it was

2927
02:02:20,118 --> 02:02:27,279
this amazing Union and it had like dark

2928
02:02:24,279 --> 02:02:32,039
blue tones to the plant right it was

2929
02:02:27,279 --> 02:02:33,840
super interesting and just fire flavor

2930
02:02:32,039 --> 02:02:36,118
we brought it to the Unicorn cup in the

2931
02:02:33,840 --> 02:02:39,279
area here and we didn't enter it but it

2932
02:02:36,118 --> 02:02:42,198
was wow moment you know to putting it up

2933
02:02:39,279 --> 02:02:44,118
so yeah know knowing your tpping

2934
02:02:42,198 --> 02:02:46,559
profiles and how dominant they can be

2935
02:02:44,118 --> 02:02:49,479
and bringing two together two dominant

2936
02:02:46,560 --> 02:02:51,840
ones can be really obviously P pretty

2937
02:02:49,479 --> 02:02:54,118
powerful so thanks for that number

2938
02:02:51,840 --> 02:02:56,599
number four Kevin

2939
02:02:54,118 --> 02:02:58,279
really it it's got the resistance in it

2940
02:02:56,599 --> 02:03:00,078
too you know I had it so right right

2941
02:02:58,279 --> 02:03:03,198
next to it I had the Mean Mug which is a

2942
02:03:00,078 --> 02:03:05,399
GMO root beer BX cross root beer

2943
02:03:03,198 --> 02:03:06,638
bx2 and they they couldn't make it they

2944
02:03:05,399 --> 02:03:08,118
couldn't handle it they you know they

2945
02:03:06,639 --> 02:03:09,560
they grew well they looked good but when

2946
02:03:08,118 --> 02:03:11,319
the when the pressure came they they

2947
02:03:09,560 --> 02:03:13,880
folded at the end you know they do do

2948
02:03:11,319 --> 02:03:15,559
good in the greenhouse but it just just

2949
02:03:13,880 --> 02:03:17,118
kind of was very clear to see what the

2950
02:03:15,560 --> 02:03:21,039
what the chem dog was throwing in there

2951
02:03:17,118 --> 02:03:21,039
you know in that instance

2952
02:03:24,158 --> 02:03:27,759
yeah it's a it's a good line you know

2953
02:03:26,039 --> 02:03:29,679
when when it first popped out we dug

2954
02:03:27,760 --> 02:03:32,560
through it

2955
02:03:29,679 --> 02:03:34,239
and we just that at that time you know

2956
02:03:32,560 --> 02:03:36,199
we would just releasing material into

2957
02:03:34,238 --> 02:03:38,319
the system so people had access and I

2958
02:03:36,198 --> 02:03:40,399
started releasing Mals into the system

2959
02:03:38,319 --> 02:03:42,880
that I had used that really threw some

2960
02:03:40,399 --> 02:03:44,879
interesting traits and I would just I

2961
02:03:42,880 --> 02:03:47,400
was releasing it all over the place and

2962
02:03:44,880 --> 02:03:49,679
it was free I wasn't selling the the the

2963
02:03:47,399 --> 02:03:51,799
the work it was just really so that

2964
02:03:49,679 --> 02:03:54,199
people had access to some stuff that

2965
02:03:51,800 --> 02:03:55,440
they gave him some value and so it's

2966
02:03:54,198 --> 02:03:56,960
just funny because all the years down

2967
02:03:55,439 --> 02:03:59,319
the road you still see all this stuff

2968
02:03:56,960 --> 02:04:00,719
popping out but you know that that's the

2969
02:03:59,319 --> 02:04:03,198
whole point and I think that that's why

2970
02:04:00,719 --> 02:04:05,559
I love being you know be invited to be

2971
02:04:03,198 --> 02:04:08,519
part of the regenerative crew is that

2972
02:04:05,559 --> 02:04:10,599
it's just really a healthy human group

2973
02:04:08,520 --> 02:04:12,280
and it's it's just really refreshing

2974
02:04:10,599 --> 02:04:15,800
because

2975
02:04:12,279 --> 02:04:17,319
it it lets you feel like you're alive

2976
02:04:15,800 --> 02:04:18,679
everything else is just basically you

2977
02:04:17,319 --> 02:04:21,078
just keep your head down and move your

2978
02:04:18,679 --> 02:04:24,000
feet but when you get to do work with

2979
02:04:21,078 --> 02:04:26,319
other people in a in a in a genuine way

2980
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,319
it's

2981
02:04:27,439 --> 02:04:32,039
enriching I I wanted to ask you Kev did

2982
02:04:29,960 --> 02:04:33,880
you ever find any perennial genetics in

2983
02:04:32,039 --> 02:04:35,039
the zamal I know you've grown quite a

2984
02:04:33,880 --> 02:04:37,359
bit of it or worked with people that

2985
02:04:35,039 --> 02:04:41,559
have worked with quite a bit of it you

2986
02:04:37,359 --> 02:04:45,279
know um I I I started to tap into it but

2987
02:04:41,559 --> 02:04:47,360
then I I ran out of uh space and so I

2988
02:04:45,279 --> 02:04:49,800
never got to dive deep into the zamal

2989
02:04:47,359 --> 02:04:51,439
populations and I I ran zamal hybrids

2990
02:04:49,800 --> 02:04:54,719
but they had been hybridized down to

2991
02:04:51,439 --> 02:04:56,558
where had a reasonable finish time but

2992
02:04:54,719 --> 02:04:59,239
I've I've never got a chance to run the

2993
02:04:56,559 --> 02:05:01,199
two-year cut you know where where it's

2994
02:04:59,238 --> 02:05:05,319
going to grow for a year then flower the

2995
02:05:01,198 --> 02:05:07,118
next year almost like a banial and I

2996
02:05:05,319 --> 02:05:09,840
haven't and it's it's just really a

2997
02:05:07,118 --> 02:05:12,639
matter of you you you only have so much

2998
02:05:09,840 --> 02:05:15,520
space and time to chase all your [ __ ]

2999
02:05:12,639 --> 02:05:17,440
and I end up chasing so much [ __ ] that I

3000
02:05:15,520 --> 02:05:20,480
I end up cutting most of my personal

3001
02:05:17,439 --> 02:05:23,039
life right out of my life and I have

3002
02:05:20,479 --> 02:05:26,039
kids and try to make sure that my kids

3003
02:05:23,039 --> 02:05:29,960
get priority and then everything else

3004
02:05:26,039 --> 02:05:32,198
comes after that and so it you you can

3005
02:05:29,960 --> 02:05:33,840
only take on so much at a time you know

3006
02:05:32,198 --> 02:05:37,759
what I mean but I'm fascinated with the

3007
02:05:33,840 --> 02:05:37,760
zamal work I always wanted to go to the

3008
02:05:50,238 --> 02:05:54,598
re from out there there we didn't find

3009
02:05:52,599 --> 02:05:57,159
any there but there is I still have 12

3010
02:05:54,599 --> 02:05:59,319
seeds left sitting in Zimbabwe which is

3011
02:05:57,158 --> 02:06:00,679
very close in Latitude which I thought

3012
02:05:59,319 --> 02:06:01,880
if I if I'm going to have that

3013
02:06:00,679 --> 02:06:04,399
expression that's where I'm going to

3014
02:06:01,880 --> 02:06:06,118
have it so we are gonna once we get

3015
02:06:04,399 --> 02:06:08,799
fired back up again uh we're going to

3016
02:06:06,118 --> 02:06:10,839
pop those we just we're working on CBD

3017
02:06:08,800 --> 02:06:13,079
uh early on but uh everything's still

3018
02:06:10,840 --> 02:06:14,880
kind of on pause due to the virus and

3019
02:06:13,078 --> 02:06:16,799
basically the inability to export stuff

3020
02:06:14,880 --> 02:06:19,760
through South Africa right now and for

3021
02:06:16,800 --> 02:06:19,760
the last year and a half

3022
02:06:20,399 --> 02:06:25,319
basically this great um I really

3023
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:27,479
appreciate uh being on here with

3024
02:06:25,319 --> 02:06:29,799
everybody here I I I respect everybody

3025
02:06:27,479 --> 02:06:32,238
that's here uh and and and really

3026
02:06:29,800 --> 02:06:34,639
appreciate everybody's work um I like

3027
02:06:32,238 --> 02:06:39,439
hearing about people talking about the

3028
02:06:34,639 --> 02:06:39,440
Turin and the the together you know

3029
02:06:50,359 --> 02:06:55,839
I um as those come as you as you develop

3030
02:06:54,279 --> 02:06:57,158
that and then you cross them back

3031
02:06:55,840 --> 02:06:58,639
against something that's really

3032
02:06:57,158 --> 02:07:01,679
different and this comes back to what

3033
02:06:58,639 --> 02:07:04,559
Josh you were talking about Josh and

3034
02:07:01,679 --> 02:07:06,800
Kelly Dragonfly um just getting two that

3035
02:07:04,559 --> 02:07:08,599
blend really well to me it seems like if

3036
02:07:06,800 --> 02:07:10,599
you've got one poly hybrid and you got

3037
02:07:08,599 --> 02:07:13,319
one inbred line and you cross them you

3038
02:07:10,599 --> 02:07:16,279
get a dominated thing but if you've got

3039
02:07:13,319 --> 02:07:19,558
two really solid uh predictable at least

3040
02:07:16,279 --> 02:07:22,559
in one level traits and and in this case

3041
02:07:19,559 --> 02:07:24,800
maybe tpin and you go back and put them

3042
02:07:22,559 --> 02:07:27,400
together what happens it seems based on

3043
02:07:24,800 --> 02:07:29,840
coas and what I've done is it brings

3044
02:07:27,399 --> 02:07:32,198
both of those tpine groups in and

3045
02:07:29,840 --> 02:07:33,960
complexifies the end result and gives

3046
02:07:32,198 --> 02:07:35,759
you say if you have a terpinolene

3047
02:07:33,960 --> 02:07:38,880
dominant and you have a mine dominant

3048
02:07:35,760 --> 02:07:40,960
and you make a real F1 with two f6s or

3049
02:07:38,880 --> 02:07:43,078
something what you end up seeing is a

3050
02:07:40,960 --> 02:07:46,399
collaborative uh joining and

3051
02:07:43,078 --> 02:07:48,479
strengthening an overall tpine um

3052
02:07:46,399 --> 02:07:50,279
numbers which you know this is the kind

3053
02:07:48,479 --> 02:07:52,319
of stuff that I've just been kind of you

3054
02:07:50,279 --> 02:07:55,840
know one season at a time just looking

3055
02:07:52,319 --> 02:07:57,920
at and and um I'm stoked that other

3056
02:07:55,840 --> 02:08:00,000
people are as interested in that stuff

3057
02:07:57,920 --> 02:08:01,840
and and looking at it because I think

3058
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:04,439
when we all come together and start to

3059
02:08:01,840 --> 02:08:08,279
share these genetics we really can

3060
02:08:04,439 --> 02:08:11,598
further the potential of of really

3061
02:08:08,279 --> 02:08:14,439
Nuance stuff within the Cannabis genome

3062
02:08:11,599 --> 02:08:15,559
and and and yeah I have to get going

3063
02:08:14,439 --> 02:08:17,479
because I got a little one who's GNA

3064
02:08:15,559 --> 02:08:21,480
have to take over the space and and and

3065
02:08:17,479 --> 02:08:23,519
get a nap here pretty soon so um I I app

3066
02:08:21,479 --> 02:08:24,959
app everybody I I don't even know how to

3067
02:08:23,520 --> 02:08:28,000
use this thing that well as I can't even

3068
02:08:24,960 --> 02:08:30,279
tell who's on this thing I just have my

3069
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:33,039
wife set it up and um I don't know how

3070
02:08:30,279 --> 02:08:34,759
to write say goodbye and stuff but um

3071
02:08:33,039 --> 02:08:36,880
just wanted to say that uh it was a

3072
02:08:34,760 --> 02:08:38,840
pleasure being here uh I I'd love to be

3073
02:08:36,880 --> 02:08:42,480
in a room with you all it would it would

3074
02:08:38,840 --> 02:08:44,159
make a little more sense to me um but

3075
02:08:42,479 --> 02:08:45,558
thanks and and it's good seeing some

3076
02:08:44,158 --> 02:08:47,799
faces that I haven't seen in a while I

3077
02:08:45,559 --> 02:08:49,840
look forward to the

3078
02:08:47,800 --> 02:08:53,440
conference cheers homie I look forward

3079
02:08:49,840 --> 02:08:53,440
to seeing you thanks for coming on

3080
02:08:54,238 --> 02:08:58,158
Big Love Eric Eric what's going on with

3081
02:08:56,238 --> 02:09:00,039
you in genetics you got anything that

3082
02:08:58,158 --> 02:09:02,879
you're you're excited about these days I

3083
02:09:00,039 --> 02:09:02,880
know you're a big hash

3084
02:09:04,158 --> 02:09:10,759
head uh man I'm excited about all kinds

3085
02:09:07,639 --> 02:09:12,520
of things I mean I I I feel like

3086
02:09:10,760 --> 02:09:15,599
whenever I run into someone there's

3087
02:09:12,520 --> 02:09:17,880
something uh exciting going on and you

3088
02:09:15,599 --> 02:09:20,719
know for right now a genetic acquisition

3089
02:09:17,880 --> 02:09:23,400
is really a Hot Topic I feel like for

3090
02:09:20,719 --> 02:09:25,800
small farm fs and big farms just

3091
02:09:23,399 --> 02:09:28,519
because um things get watered down

3092
02:09:25,800 --> 02:09:30,639
pretty easy out there in the market and

3093
02:09:28,520 --> 02:09:33,239
um not all cuts are the same I mean

3094
02:09:30,639 --> 02:09:35,599
there's you know you know people are

3095
02:09:33,238 --> 02:09:37,879
talking about this stuff on LinkedIn and

3096
02:09:35,599 --> 02:09:39,239
social other social media platforms on

3097
02:09:37,880 --> 02:09:42,159
the fact that you know a lot of the

3098
02:09:39,238 --> 02:09:43,678
genetics out there um are really hyped

3099
02:09:42,158 --> 02:09:45,399
up by the name but you know the

3100
02:09:43,679 --> 02:09:47,158
selection process from Nursery to

3101
02:09:45,399 --> 02:09:48,519
Nursery or Farm to farm is quite

3102
02:09:47,158 --> 02:09:50,679
different and so some of these things

3103
02:09:48,520 --> 02:09:54,199
get turned into memes when in fact they

3104
02:09:50,679 --> 02:09:56,319
are you know uh quite fascinating when

3105
02:09:54,198 --> 02:09:58,919
you have the right cut and so I think

3106
02:09:56,319 --> 02:10:01,399
it's really going to be up to farms and

3107
02:09:58,920 --> 02:10:03,239
and uh people in general to really get

3108
02:10:01,399 --> 02:10:05,118
this selection process figured out

3109
02:10:03,238 --> 02:10:08,638
because you can have a hype name and be

3110
02:10:05,118 --> 02:10:11,279
a complete winner um in some cases but

3111
02:10:08,639 --> 02:10:13,599
at the same time um you can you know

3112
02:10:11,279 --> 02:10:15,719
have some of these great names and and

3113
02:10:13,599 --> 02:10:17,078
it's a complete [ __ ] at the end of

3114
02:10:15,719 --> 02:10:18,880
the day and some of the [ __ ] of

3115
02:10:17,078 --> 02:10:20,158
what's gotten propelled in can in

3116
02:10:18,880 --> 02:10:22,559
California through a lot of these

3117
02:10:20,158 --> 02:10:24,078
nurseries just by maybe it's just been

3118
02:10:22,559 --> 02:10:25,800
by accident maybe it looked like a

3119
02:10:24,078 --> 02:10:27,599
winner at first but it didn't turn out

3120
02:10:25,800 --> 02:10:31,480
to stay that way or something I don't

3121
02:10:27,599 --> 02:10:33,480
know but um and that because of the Hop

3122
02:10:31,479 --> 02:10:35,759
late and vroid the nursery side of the

3123
02:10:33,479 --> 02:10:38,759
things are really getting uh uh

3124
02:10:35,760 --> 02:10:40,679
difficult too I mean um you know people

3125
02:10:38,760 --> 02:10:42,679
are turning to seeds more and so that's

3126
02:10:40,679 --> 02:10:46,118
why I say the selection process is

3127
02:10:42,679 --> 02:10:47,920
really you know the next uh key you know

3128
02:10:46,118 --> 02:10:49,719
strategy in learning how to do that

3129
02:10:47,920 --> 02:10:51,559
properly from Farm to farm I'm sure the

3130
02:10:49,719 --> 02:10:54,118
interpretation is different from person

3131
02:10:51,559 --> 02:10:56,239
to person place to place but sourcing

3132
02:10:54,118 --> 02:10:57,839
the right seeds picking the right winner

3133
02:10:56,238 --> 02:10:59,919
out of those and trying to

3134
02:10:57,840 --> 02:11:02,319
circumnavigate some of this Nursery

3135
02:10:59,920 --> 02:11:05,679
stuff while this you know hop situation

3136
02:11:02,319 --> 02:11:07,558
gets uh uh dealt with I mean tissue

3137
02:11:05,679 --> 02:11:10,279
culture is definitely an option too as

3138
02:11:07,559 --> 02:11:11,960
long as the Sops are followed but um I

3139
02:11:10,279 --> 02:11:13,960
just see it's kind of a difficult time

3140
02:11:11,960 --> 02:11:17,480
right now for certain Farms to navigate

3141
02:11:13,960 --> 02:11:20,078
things when when uh you know we we've

3142
02:11:17,479 --> 02:11:22,158
got you know Brands to kind of fulfill

3143
02:11:20,078 --> 02:11:24,880
or names to fulfill we also are trying

3144
02:11:22,158 --> 02:11:26,558
to get healthy plants passed around and

3145
02:11:24,880 --> 02:11:28,239
it even makes it hard to pass things

3146
02:11:26,559 --> 02:11:30,719
around like we used to people are more

3147
02:11:28,238 --> 02:11:33,319
reluctant to pass around to cut anymore

3148
02:11:30,719 --> 02:11:36,599
than they are sharing some

3149
02:11:33,319 --> 02:11:36,599
seeds well

3150
02:11:37,039 --> 02:11:41,760
it's I just lost my train of thought

3151
02:11:39,639 --> 02:11:45,719
damn Stoner

3152
02:11:41,760 --> 02:11:48,079
hey is there a is there an OG cut still

3153
02:11:45,719 --> 02:11:49,719
an original OG cut rolling around glass

3154
02:11:48,078 --> 02:11:53,759
Grass Valley Zone because I know that

3155
02:11:49,719 --> 02:11:57,158
you are of huge lover of the original

3156
02:11:53,760 --> 02:11:59,559
OG yeah dude it's so [ __ ] hard to

3157
02:11:57,158 --> 02:12:02,359
find anymore like it used to be just you

3158
02:11:59,559 --> 02:12:04,159
know everything was OG gas and it's like

3159
02:12:02,359 --> 02:12:05,960
man and I buddy there's a couple people

3160
02:12:04,158 --> 02:12:07,439
around here that have the original one

3161
02:12:05,960 --> 02:12:09,158
and I talked to somebody the other day

3162
02:12:07,439 --> 02:12:11,439
just about getting the sack to smoke I

3163
02:12:09,158 --> 02:12:13,198
don't you know I'm not worried about

3164
02:12:11,439 --> 02:12:15,319
exactly getting the cut and growing it

3165
02:12:13,198 --> 02:12:17,799
myself anymore just because of where I'm

3166
02:12:15,319 --> 02:12:20,840
at these days and my traveling and

3167
02:12:17,800 --> 02:12:23,199
ability to you know uh you know farm at

3168
02:12:20,840 --> 02:12:25,400
the same times especially keeping some

3169
02:12:23,198 --> 02:12:27,000
cannabis plants around and so I just

3170
02:12:25,399 --> 02:12:28,879
like to smoke it you know like the beta

3171
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:30,679
car offene thing's cool and all that

3172
02:12:28,880 --> 02:12:32,760
stuff and there's definitely some tasty

3173
02:12:30,679 --> 02:12:34,679
stuff but at the end of the day when you

3174
02:12:32,760 --> 02:12:37,199
want to sit down and smoke your gas it's

3175
02:12:34,679 --> 02:12:39,239
a little bit harder to get to but seeing

3176
02:12:37,198 --> 02:12:42,279
the genetics out there is amazing

3177
02:12:39,238 --> 02:12:44,479
because I was just actually in Florida

3178
02:12:42,279 --> 02:12:46,359
at a farm that's you know trying to deal

3179
02:12:44,479 --> 02:12:48,558
with genetics and there's a lot of bushy

3180
02:12:46,359 --> 02:12:51,920
plants and things that are called OG and

3181
02:12:48,559 --> 02:12:54,320
Kush and stuff like that but they really

3182
02:12:51,920 --> 02:12:56,559
just in the in as far as looking at a

3183
02:12:54,319 --> 02:12:58,920
plant as a teen even don't have the

3184
02:12:56,559 --> 02:13:00,520
characteristics that the real OG had and

3185
02:12:58,920 --> 02:13:02,199
then all of a sudden when you do see it

3186
02:13:00,520 --> 02:13:04,239
it's like wow it's all almost like

3187
02:13:02,198 --> 02:13:06,960
something you hadn't seen in a long time

3188
02:13:04,238 --> 02:13:09,198
stretches really far not a lot of sights

3189
02:13:06,960 --> 02:13:10,880
just you know starts to want to lean

3190
02:13:09,198 --> 02:13:12,759
over it's almost like a plant that you

3191
02:13:10,880 --> 02:13:13,719
see in the wintertime that doesn't get

3192
02:13:12,760 --> 02:13:17,039
enough

3193
02:13:13,719 --> 02:13:18,679
light they just elongate and stretch but

3194
02:13:17,039 --> 02:13:20,399
you know under the right conditions with

3195
02:13:18,679 --> 02:13:22,559
the right light everything's doing fine

3196
02:13:20,399 --> 02:13:24,359
but you look over and see those ogs just

3197
02:13:22,559 --> 02:13:25,520
stretched out like that and you go wow

3198
02:13:24,359 --> 02:13:27,558
that's something I haven't seen in a

3199
02:13:25,520 --> 02:13:29,320
long time and it's no wonder in some

3200
02:13:27,559 --> 02:13:31,520
cases that it's not in production as

3201
02:13:29,319 --> 02:13:33,158
much it just is uh you know some of

3202
02:13:31,520 --> 02:13:35,199
those original ones aren't the biggest

3203
02:13:33,158 --> 02:13:37,078
producers in this day and age and

3204
02:13:35,198 --> 02:13:39,198
especially the price of cannabis and

3205
02:13:37,078 --> 02:13:41,759
Cali you got to get the most bang for

3206
02:13:39,198 --> 02:13:44,839
your buck it's interesting that the sour

3207
02:13:41,760 --> 02:13:47,440
diesel mother clone has still really

3208
02:13:44,840 --> 02:13:48,960
kind of you can find it you know and

3209
02:13:47,439 --> 02:13:51,158
it's interesting how that one stayed

3210
02:13:48,960 --> 02:13:54,078
pretty steady it's just like bam we got

3211
02:13:51,158 --> 02:13:57,479
Sour Diesel you know and I love that

3212
02:13:54,078 --> 02:13:59,679
that's around so and I I'm just a little

3213
02:13:57,479 --> 02:14:01,359
curious about how kangan water is used

3214
02:13:59,679 --> 02:14:04,118
in the nursery

3215
02:14:01,359 --> 02:14:08,279
if you may have already talked about

3216
02:14:04,118 --> 02:14:08,279
that but it seems like

3217
02:14:09,319 --> 02:14:14,000
a I got a sack for you Eric when you

3218
02:14:11,800 --> 02:14:15,079
come in when you come in humal I got I I

3219
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:18,359
you know me I still have all the

3220
02:14:15,078 --> 02:14:21,880
original [ __ ] and I and I still grow it

3221
02:14:18,359 --> 02:14:22,960
for myself because I like to smoke OG

3222
02:14:21,880 --> 02:14:26,480
and

3223
02:14:22,960 --> 02:14:28,840
uh I'll bring you bag when you roll into

3224
02:14:26,479 --> 02:14:30,238
town yeah yeah I'm excited to come up

3225
02:14:28,840 --> 02:14:32,559
for the region and you know I signed up

3226
02:14:30,238 --> 02:14:35,000
for the [ __ ] ganier like I'm all

3227
02:14:32,559 --> 02:14:37,320
about it like it took me a minute to get

3228
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:39,439
signed up but I'm excited I mean I've

3229
02:14:37,319 --> 02:14:41,799
been a big fan ever since you developed

3230
02:14:39,439 --> 02:14:43,638
the concept and getting the community

3231
02:14:41,800 --> 02:14:45,840
together and going to the spring kickoff

3232
02:14:43,639 --> 02:14:48,078
was a big one and you know going to the

3233
02:14:45,840 --> 02:14:49,960
golden tarp Awards I remember speaking

3234
02:14:48,078 --> 02:14:52,479
at the one of the first golden tarp

3235
02:14:49,960 --> 02:14:54,880
Awards in uh I'm not really a public

3236
02:14:52,479 --> 02:14:56,319
speaker by any accounts I kind of just

3237
02:14:54,880 --> 02:14:58,199
had to it was something I felt like I

3238
02:14:56,319 --> 02:15:00,279
had to do in the business side of things

3239
02:14:58,198 --> 02:15:01,759
and so when I was at the golden tarp

3240
02:15:00,279 --> 02:15:03,158
Awards they didn't have a projector and

3241
02:15:01,760 --> 02:15:05,000
it was the first time that I did a

3242
02:15:03,158 --> 02:15:07,399
presentation without a slid screen

3243
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:09,800
because I kind of used that to move me

3244
02:15:07,399 --> 02:15:12,158
along and so it was more off the cuff

3245
02:15:09,800 --> 02:15:13,920
and I remember using my hands so much

3246
02:15:12,158 --> 02:15:15,598
that I banged into the microphone and

3247
02:15:13,920 --> 02:15:18,520
knocked it over I was a nervous [ __ ]

3248
02:15:15,599 --> 02:15:21,119
wreck but yeah man it's going to be good

3249
02:15:18,520 --> 02:15:23,199
to hang out and go through the process

3250
02:15:21,118 --> 02:15:24,920
excited impressed with what you guys

3251
02:15:23,198 --> 02:15:26,719
have done well you know the beauty of

3252
02:15:24,920 --> 02:15:28,679
the the ganier is that you know we use

3253
02:15:26,719 --> 02:15:29,719
those four categories of perception as

3254
02:15:28,679 --> 02:15:31,800
the

3255
02:15:29,719 --> 02:15:33,800
classifications and a woman named Ellen

3256
02:15:31,800 --> 02:15:37,000
Holland just released a really good book

3257
02:15:33,800 --> 02:15:39,239
called weed and the first 90 pages of it

3258
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:41,960
are the four categories and then the

3259
02:15:39,238 --> 02:15:46,000
next section is all the craft Farmers

3260
02:15:41,960 --> 02:15:46,000
aren't you in that season are you in

3261
02:15:46,039 --> 02:15:52,439
weed what do you mean am I in weed are

3262
02:15:48,880 --> 02:15:54,319
you in that b weed no I'm no there's a

3263
02:15:52,439 --> 02:15:55,558
ton of craft Farmers that she brought in

3264
02:15:54,319 --> 02:15:57,679
to talk about all the different

3265
02:15:55,559 --> 02:16:00,360
production methodologies which Drive

3266
02:15:57,679 --> 02:16:03,039
quality but the first third of the book

3267
02:16:00,359 --> 02:16:05,920
is is all based off of my my four

3268
02:16:03,039 --> 02:16:07,960
categorical divisions and so what it

3269
02:16:05,920 --> 02:16:11,118
does is it starts just to allow us to be

3270
02:16:07,960 --> 02:16:14,880
able to use some of these simplified but

3271
02:16:11,118 --> 02:16:16,558
accurate methods of explanation so that

3272
02:16:14,880 --> 02:16:17,920
what you get is you get an ability to

3273
02:16:16,559 --> 02:16:19,400
have conversations with people because

3274
02:16:17,920 --> 02:16:22,039
when you start taking them

3275
02:16:19,399 --> 02:16:24,479
into you you start take down the

3276
02:16:22,039 --> 02:16:26,439
metabolite route you lose people too

3277
02:16:24,479 --> 02:16:28,879
quickly and what you want to be able to

3278
02:16:26,439 --> 02:16:31,000
do is get them enthused not wow them

3279
02:16:28,880 --> 02:16:32,760
with your incredible [ __ ] memory of

3280
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:35,079
recollection of what profiles are

3281
02:16:32,760 --> 02:16:37,719
present but it smells like a

3282
02:16:35,079 --> 02:16:41,280
banana and it it's it's a lot easier to

3283
02:16:37,718 --> 02:16:42,879
say than it has aamine and so when you

3284
02:16:41,280 --> 02:16:45,280
when you put it all together it works

3285
02:16:42,879 --> 02:16:47,718
and it's just a matter of of you know

3286
02:16:45,280 --> 02:16:49,519
trying to work together where we can use

3287
02:16:47,718 --> 02:16:51,638
the all the different skill sets from

3288
02:16:49,519 --> 02:16:54,079
all of us to present information that

3289
02:16:51,638 --> 02:16:56,799
allows people to make better choices and

3290
02:16:54,079 --> 02:16:58,318
more more better for them not not so

3291
02:16:56,799 --> 02:17:00,239
much better for me it's just better

3292
02:16:58,318 --> 02:17:02,519
better choices in general so you're

3293
02:17:00,239 --> 02:17:05,398
gonna dig it you really like the program

3294
02:17:02,519 --> 02:17:07,559
and I the the the location we're going

3295
02:17:05,398 --> 02:17:09,679
to shift it from my spot at the One log

3296
02:17:07,558 --> 02:17:12,358
because the cookies uh Equity program

3297
02:17:09,679 --> 02:17:14,439
goes in this spring so they get an

3298
02:17:12,359 --> 02:17:16,920
equity program where you got uh Chris

3299
02:17:14,439 --> 02:17:18,920
Weber out of Detroit he put together a

3300
02:17:16,920 --> 02:17:21,239
huge uh facility in Detroit and they're

3301
02:17:18,920 --> 02:17:23,318
they're having people that qualify as

3302
02:17:21,239 --> 02:17:25,398
Equity participants from around the US

3303
02:17:23,318 --> 02:17:28,000
fly up to us to spend a couple months at

3304
02:17:25,398 --> 02:17:29,959
the One log so they can get an education

3305
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:32,920
on basically what's the new industry and

3306
02:17:29,959 --> 02:17:35,558
also how do you use your Equity

3307
02:17:32,920 --> 02:17:37,040
situation to your best potential because

3308
02:17:35,558 --> 02:17:38,558
that's the issue that you have these

3309
02:17:37,040 --> 02:17:41,639
individuals with

3310
02:17:38,558 --> 02:17:43,840
Equity ability but they end up getting

3311
02:17:41,638 --> 02:17:46,839
[ __ ] because you you kind of use it as

3312
02:17:43,840 --> 02:17:49,439
a a an a door to get into a license and

3313
02:17:46,840 --> 02:17:51,679
the thing is what they get is a stien

3314
02:17:49,439 --> 02:17:53,760
not generational wealth which is what

3315
02:17:51,679 --> 02:17:55,318
you should get from these businesses you

3316
02:17:53,760 --> 02:17:58,359
should have an ability to create

3317
02:17:55,318 --> 02:18:01,799
something [ __ ] longterm that benefits

3318
02:17:58,359 --> 02:18:03,800
for time and so when we run that program

3319
02:18:01,799 --> 02:18:08,438
at the One log it'll it'll it'll take

3320
02:18:03,799 --> 02:18:11,039
over the facility and so uh uh Derek has

3321
02:18:08,439 --> 02:18:13,318
a beautiful location up in Salmon Creek

3322
02:18:11,040 --> 02:18:15,000
so he's got like a 200 acre location in

3323
02:18:13,318 --> 02:18:17,199
Salmon Creek where we're GNA have the

3324
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:19,200
events and it'll be killer because we'll

3325
02:18:17,200 --> 02:18:22,880
be able bring farmers in and it'll be a

3326
02:18:19,200 --> 02:18:24,439
lot easier for people to and go but it's

3327
02:18:22,879 --> 02:18:27,638
been a really good program and the

3328
02:18:24,439 --> 02:18:29,519
feedbacks been excellent and you know

3329
02:18:27,638 --> 02:18:31,558
the main point is just trying to be able

3330
02:18:29,519 --> 02:18:33,519
to get the public to understand better

3331
02:18:31,558 --> 02:18:35,039
what it is they buy and why they buy it

3332
02:18:33,519 --> 02:18:38,318
so that you Empower them to make the

3333
02:18:35,040 --> 02:18:41,800
right choices be it whatever and for the

3334
02:18:38,318 --> 02:18:43,799
smaller farmer the the quality of

3335
02:18:41,799 --> 02:18:45,879
product is where we shine because you're

3336
02:18:43,799 --> 02:18:49,959
going to bring cultivars forward that

3337
02:18:45,879 --> 02:18:51,279
are not on the five pounds per 25 square

3338
02:18:49,959 --> 02:18:54,000
foot

3339
02:18:51,280 --> 02:18:56,599
um metric you know you're you're you're

3340
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:59,519
you're going for quality of experience

3341
02:18:56,599 --> 02:19:01,318
more than I'm getting x amount out and

3342
02:18:59,519 --> 02:19:04,559
the only way that can happen is if the

3343
02:19:01,318 --> 02:19:05,959
price is above $400 a pound and so I

3344
02:19:04,558 --> 02:19:07,759
have some really cool [ __ ] I'm working

3345
02:19:05,959 --> 02:19:10,558
on but I'll break all that out at the EV

3346
02:19:07,760 --> 02:19:12,200
I've been busy your boy been busy yeah

3347
02:19:10,558 --> 02:19:14,039
no it sounds like it and I've always

3348
02:19:12,200 --> 02:19:16,040
love the fact that we qualify the weed

3349
02:19:14,040 --> 02:19:19,280
based on the smells you know like not

3350
02:19:16,040 --> 02:19:21,200
all these other reports and you know THC

3351
02:19:19,280 --> 02:19:22,840
and stuff like that and so you know I

3352
02:19:21,200 --> 02:19:25,880
mean the hemp people had to do that you

3353
02:19:22,840 --> 02:19:28,679
know with the phytology and the phyto

3354
02:19:25,879 --> 02:19:31,239
facts and you know some of that stuff is

3355
02:19:28,679 --> 02:19:33,159
based on smokable flour being tarine

3356
02:19:31,239 --> 02:19:36,359
driven because you're not looking for

3357
02:19:33,159 --> 02:19:38,039
how much CBD it has and so you know

3358
02:19:36,359 --> 02:19:39,639
combining some of these things with what

3359
02:19:38,040 --> 02:19:42,559
you've done and what they're talking

3360
02:19:39,638 --> 02:19:44,839
about to educate people on this tpine

3361
02:19:42,558 --> 02:19:46,558
aspect of a qualitative you know way of

3362
02:19:44,840 --> 02:19:48,200
looking at cannabis is awesome we just

3363
02:19:46,558 --> 02:19:50,959
have to get the chain of distribution

3364
02:19:48,200 --> 02:19:52,439
not to [ __ ] it up in between well that's

3365
02:19:50,959 --> 02:19:54,519
the issue is I mean that's the issue we

3366
02:19:52,439 --> 02:19:57,520
go into is that you know how do you

3367
02:19:54,520 --> 02:19:59,000
approach the business you're in because

3368
02:19:57,520 --> 02:20:01,280
the issue is that you take this

3369
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:03,600
beautiful product at the farm and then

3370
02:20:01,280 --> 02:20:06,040
you to a supply chain that's as [ __ ]

3371
02:20:03,600 --> 02:20:08,559
broken as could be and by the time the

3372
02:20:06,040 --> 02:20:09,920
end person consumes it it's trash and so

3373
02:20:08,559 --> 02:20:11,439
like for me when I'm doing breeding

3374
02:20:09,920 --> 02:20:12,639
projects right now a lot of the stuff

3375
02:20:11,439 --> 02:20:15,200
that I'm working on is we're doing

3376
02:20:12,639 --> 02:20:17,318
holdability testing to find out what's

3377
02:20:15,200 --> 02:20:18,840
the degreg when it's not held in in

3378
02:20:17,318 --> 02:20:21,680
refrigerated

3379
02:20:18,840 --> 02:20:24,000
stasis does it actually Ain any

3380
02:20:21,680 --> 02:20:26,720
qualities and does the plant have an

3381
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:28,799
ability to handle the vibration and

3382
02:20:26,719 --> 02:20:30,959
movement through the supply chain

3383
02:20:28,799 --> 02:20:33,920
because I've never seen a a container

3384
02:20:30,959 --> 02:20:35,679
that wasn't kicked and pushed and you

3385
02:20:33,920 --> 02:20:38,920
know I mean like they just get Beat to

3386
02:20:35,680 --> 02:20:41,398
Death how do we create plants that fit

3387
02:20:38,920 --> 02:20:42,879
that reality so that what you have is

3388
02:20:41,398 --> 02:20:44,318
you have something that can make it

3389
02:20:42,879 --> 02:20:46,079
through the system because some of the

3390
02:20:44,318 --> 02:20:48,680
fine product I would say like what's a

3391
02:20:46,079 --> 02:20:51,439
good example um that white Thorn rose

3392
02:20:48,680 --> 02:20:53,960
that Gali does it makes some of the best

3393
02:20:51,439 --> 02:20:57,200
I've smoked in years the quality of the

3394
02:20:53,959 --> 02:20:59,639
profile is phenomenal and the flowers

3395
02:20:57,200 --> 02:21:02,720
are gorgeous but they don't hold up to

3396
02:20:59,639 --> 02:21:05,199
supply chain movement and so the problem

3397
02:21:02,719 --> 02:21:08,079
is if he puts that flower in the system

3398
02:21:05,200 --> 02:21:10,359
and it doesn't move smoothly it just it

3399
02:21:08,079 --> 02:21:12,680
gets destroyed and it ends up making

3400
02:21:10,359 --> 02:21:14,680
Johnny look like he's an inferior farmer

3401
02:21:12,680 --> 02:21:17,280
with an inferior product and it couldn't

3402
02:21:14,680 --> 02:21:19,200
be any further from the truth he's a

3403
02:21:17,280 --> 02:21:22,359
great farmer and he's got a great

3404
02:21:19,200 --> 02:21:25,079
product but the syst screwed up and so

3405
02:21:22,359 --> 02:21:28,239
you you do the best you can

3406
02:21:25,079 --> 02:21:29,760
to fix problems in the in the short term

3407
02:21:28,239 --> 02:21:31,799
so that there's marketability and

3408
02:21:29,760 --> 02:21:33,439
movement of product for farmers and at

3409
02:21:31,799 --> 02:21:35,398
the same time you're developing it's

3410
02:21:33,439 --> 02:21:37,159
almost like a duality of what I do one

3411
02:21:35,398 --> 02:21:38,519
of them is epicurian and the other one

3412
02:21:37,159 --> 02:21:41,200
is just dealing with the fact that the

3413
02:21:38,520 --> 02:21:42,800
system's [ __ ] and if you can't get

3414
02:21:41,200 --> 02:21:44,280
paid you're not staying alive as a

3415
02:21:42,799 --> 02:21:46,199
farmer so you have to have something

3416
02:21:44,280 --> 02:21:48,319
that can make it through the chain it

3417
02:21:46,200 --> 02:21:51,920
has to have hot numbers has to have

3418
02:21:48,318 --> 02:21:54,239
agronomic abilities and it has to to

3419
02:21:51,920 --> 02:21:56,120
handle and then the other product that

3420
02:21:54,239 --> 02:21:58,600
you can release in limited form that

3421
02:21:56,120 --> 02:21:59,760
really allows you to have an identity as

3422
02:21:58,600 --> 02:22:02,318
a craft

3423
02:21:59,760 --> 02:22:05,800
producer and that's that's important to

3424
02:22:02,318 --> 02:22:09,159
note that this week in California a lot

3425
02:22:05,799 --> 02:22:12,639
of small family farmers and craft

3426
02:22:09,159 --> 02:22:15,559
Farmers went to Sacramento to lobby at

3427
02:22:12,639 --> 02:22:17,159
the at the the Capitol building so you

3428
02:22:15,559 --> 02:22:18,959
know a lot of love to every person that

3429
02:22:17,159 --> 02:22:21,239
showed up to Capitol Building I think

3430
02:22:18,959 --> 02:22:23,879
Supernova woman on in stagram I think is

3431
02:22:21,239 --> 02:22:26,239
one woman that uh or one one group that

3432
02:22:23,879 --> 02:22:28,039
that uh covered the event Alp and glow

3433
02:22:26,239 --> 02:22:29,478
so many people were there um and it's

3434
02:22:28,040 --> 02:22:31,560
really important to note that you know

3435
02:22:29,478 --> 02:22:33,279
as we talk about regenerative farming we

3436
02:22:31,559 --> 02:22:35,478
have to continue like season does you

3437
02:22:33,280 --> 02:22:39,800
know so many people you know just work

3438
02:22:35,478 --> 02:22:42,159
actively with uh creating the the

3439
02:22:39,799 --> 02:22:44,039
environment to to embody what we're

3440
02:22:42,159 --> 02:22:46,520
doing you know like a lot of people in

3441
02:22:44,040 --> 02:22:49,880
California you can't even make products

3442
02:22:46,520 --> 02:22:51,840
so it's hard to be an amazing grower

3443
02:22:49,879 --> 02:22:53,959
with product that embody what you're

3444
02:22:51,840 --> 02:22:56,439
doing on the land because you ultimately

3445
02:22:53,959 --> 02:22:59,159
have to give it to a whole other entity

3446
02:22:56,439 --> 02:23:01,639
and hope that they represent you in in

3447
02:22:59,159 --> 02:23:03,559
the right way and I I I I that's why and

3448
02:23:01,639 --> 02:23:06,119
and and it's a global issue with

3449
02:23:03,559 --> 02:23:08,600
cannabis so uh you know just make it

3450
02:23:06,120 --> 02:23:10,439
make everyone in the world it's a global

3451
02:23:08,600 --> 02:23:12,479
issue with Farmers well let's just feel

3452
02:23:10,439 --> 02:23:15,279
represented it's everywhere in the world

3453
02:23:12,478 --> 02:23:19,159
that people are fighting corporate

3454
02:23:15,279 --> 02:23:21,600
entities India it's huge in India on at

3455
02:23:19,159 --> 02:23:24,119
this moment you know Thailand you know

3456
02:23:21,600 --> 02:23:26,079
you say oh it's legal in Thailand but a

3457
02:23:24,120 --> 02:23:27,760
lot of our friends in Thailand you know

3458
02:23:26,079 --> 02:23:30,559
are having a really hard time finding

3459
02:23:27,760 --> 02:23:32,960
something authentic that represents Thai

3460
02:23:30,559 --> 02:23:35,359
cannabis you know in their Market it's

3461
02:23:32,959 --> 02:23:37,679
very University driven and very

3462
02:23:35,359 --> 02:23:40,040
corporate driven so it's very important

3463
02:23:37,680 --> 02:23:43,479
to us as a global Community to continue

3464
02:23:40,040 --> 02:23:45,040
to work on uh you know what when we say

3465
02:23:43,478 --> 02:23:47,760
when we say support the small farmer

3466
02:23:45,040 --> 02:23:49,840
it's supporting Farmgate sales and the

3467
02:23:47,760 --> 02:23:51,760
ability for Farmers to create their own

3468
02:23:49,840 --> 02:23:55,079
their own products and get it to the the

3469
02:23:51,760 --> 02:23:58,000
people and and you can still have you

3470
02:23:55,079 --> 02:23:59,760
know uh requirements that that make the

3471
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:01,879
products you know up to standards and

3472
02:23:59,760 --> 02:24:04,398
everything but you know having to be

3473
02:24:01,879 --> 02:24:08,839
separate from your

3474
02:24:04,398 --> 02:24:10,879
retail chain it it kills the consumer

3475
02:24:08,840 --> 02:24:13,478
too because then you get limited amount

3476
02:24:10,879 --> 02:24:16,839
of products so in the end you're trying

3477
02:24:13,478 --> 02:24:21,000
to find a lot of products to to fit to

3478
02:24:16,840 --> 02:24:23,359
fit an ailment and in the recreational

3479
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:27,719
legalization it's just it's very limited

3480
02:24:23,359 --> 02:24:27,720
on what you can get and Farms would be

3481
02:24:35,079 --> 02:24:39,439
amazingly set of herbs to work with

3482
02:24:37,600 --> 02:24:42,079
along with cannabis and it would be nice

3483
02:24:39,439 --> 02:24:44,040
to see that represented as we move

3484
02:24:42,079 --> 02:24:45,959
forward you know

3485
02:24:44,040 --> 02:24:48,080
what's oh I was just going to throw a

3486
02:24:45,959 --> 02:24:49,839
toss in we're we we're right in in

3487
02:24:48,079 --> 02:24:50,920
Washington you know we're we're nine

3488
02:24:49,840 --> 02:24:52,359
years in

3489
02:24:50,920 --> 02:24:54,478
and they threw up a bill I posted

3490
02:24:52,359 --> 02:24:56,439
earlier in this week to do direct Farm

3491
02:24:54,478 --> 02:24:58,159
sales and the way we're structure a

3492
02:24:56,439 --> 02:25:00,600
little different than California in

3493
02:24:58,159 --> 02:25:02,239
order for me to get product to store I

3494
02:25:00,600 --> 02:25:04,520
have a processor license and that

3495
02:25:02,239 --> 02:25:06,439
license lets me do anything you know I

3496
02:25:04,520 --> 02:25:08,319
could I could make food if I was able to

3497
02:25:06,439 --> 02:25:09,639
put in a septic system I can't put a you

3498
02:25:08,318 --> 02:25:11,719
know wanted to put them in the septic

3499
02:25:09,639 --> 02:25:13,039
system and have a a kitchen I could do

3500
02:25:11,719 --> 02:25:15,639
that on my property I could make

3501
02:25:13,040 --> 02:25:18,200
whatever products I wanted period you

3502
02:25:15,639 --> 02:25:20,000
know I could even add in blasting and

3503
02:25:18,200 --> 02:25:22,079
and and whatever sort of processing I

3504
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:23,478
wanted Under the Sun I could do I would

3505
02:25:22,079 --> 02:25:25,879
you know maybe require some additional

3506
02:25:23,478 --> 02:25:28,079
fire stuff but with this direct Farm

3507
02:25:25,879 --> 02:25:30,959
thing it really gives me the ability to

3508
02:25:28,079 --> 02:25:32,639
do craft things and and you know I was I

3509
02:25:30,959 --> 02:25:35,159
my testimony when I got on the public

3510
02:25:32,639 --> 02:25:38,000
thing Friday was hey I want to do maybe

3511
02:25:35,159 --> 02:25:40,879
one event a month tops like maybe

3512
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:42,398
quarterly you know maybe by twice a year

3513
02:25:40,879 --> 02:25:44,398
have an event where I sell some products

3514
02:25:42,398 --> 02:25:45,760
direct you know have an educational

3515
02:25:44,398 --> 02:25:47,398
event and have some my products

3516
02:25:45,760 --> 02:25:49,559
available on the side type thing and

3517
02:25:47,398 --> 02:25:52,478
like make it real and then maybe sell to

3518
02:25:49,559 --> 02:25:56,119
my neighbors as they came by you know um

3519
02:25:52,478 --> 02:25:58,278
and uh it would it would be huge for our

3520
02:25:56,120 --> 02:26:00,319
family because even though I have the

3521
02:25:58,279 --> 02:26:02,359
ability and all those licenses in order

3522
02:26:00,318 --> 02:26:04,079
for me to take it on I can't do it

3523
02:26:02,359 --> 02:26:06,359
personally by myself I I need a whole

3524
02:26:04,079 --> 02:26:08,760
processing facility I need a warehouse I

3525
02:26:06,359 --> 02:26:10,600
need employees to even to get herb you

3526
02:26:08,760 --> 02:26:13,079
know into the store I have I I kind of

3527
02:26:10,600 --> 02:26:15,120
started down these paths and then I I

3528
02:26:13,079 --> 02:26:17,398
realized and learned how challenging it

3529
02:26:15,120 --> 02:26:19,600
is similar to what Nick was saying and

3530
02:26:17,398 --> 02:26:22,159
it's like this isn't what I want to do

3531
02:26:19,600 --> 02:26:24,000
when I signed for this I didn't want to

3532
02:26:22,159 --> 02:26:27,559
like learn how to run a sticker printer

3533
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:29,639
and do graphic design and and test this

3534
02:26:27,559 --> 02:26:32,439
cannabis for all this [ __ ] like I wanted

3535
02:26:29,639 --> 02:26:34,119
to grow and farm and and and and those

3536
02:26:32,439 --> 02:26:35,840
laws I'm just backing it up it's so if

3537
02:26:34,120 --> 02:26:38,040
you're in Washington please support like

3538
02:26:35,840 --> 02:26:39,960
this is huge in in Washington I've

3539
02:26:38,040 --> 02:26:42,359
watched and and been been a little bit a

3540
02:26:39,959 --> 02:26:44,318
part of this stuff for a decade now and

3541
02:26:42,359 --> 02:26:46,520
and the legislators really do hear the

3542
02:26:44,318 --> 02:26:47,799
the the voice of the people emailing or

3543
02:26:46,520 --> 02:26:48,640
just taking the time to send in a

3544
02:26:47,799 --> 02:26:51,079
written

3545
02:26:48,639 --> 02:26:53,278
testimony does a lot at least in our

3546
02:26:51,079 --> 02:26:55,760
state and and our state supports small

3547
02:26:53,279 --> 02:26:58,399
farmers and so as they hear that how

3548
02:26:55,760 --> 02:27:00,920
what a big impact um it really can make

3549
02:26:58,398 --> 02:27:03,478
a difference so that's my little plug on

3550
02:27:00,920 --> 02:27:06,079
that what you gonna you were gonna say

3551
02:27:03,478 --> 02:27:08,559
Kev what you have

3552
02:27:06,079 --> 02:27:11,478
is you have an issue that because the

3553
02:27:08,559 --> 02:27:13,799
United States is the destination sale

3554
02:27:11,478 --> 02:27:16,639
for most of these countries that I work

3555
02:27:13,799 --> 02:27:19,519
in they're they're they're having this

3556
02:27:16,639 --> 02:27:21,840
incredible conundrum about how do they

3557
02:27:19,520 --> 02:27:24,439
get the product that are from their area

3558
02:27:21,840 --> 02:27:27,120
into the US market and be accepted

3559
02:27:24,439 --> 02:27:28,520
because we're obsessed with morphology

3560
02:27:27,120 --> 02:27:30,680
right the Americans are obsessed with

3561
02:27:28,520 --> 02:27:32,640
looks of cannabis and so the tie are

3562
02:27:30,680 --> 02:27:35,200
trying to

3563
02:27:32,639 --> 02:27:38,159
reclassify how cannabis is viewed so

3564
02:27:35,200 --> 02:27:40,840
that you don't use as one of the

3565
02:27:38,159 --> 02:27:42,478
criteria and what I'm I'm trying to help

3566
02:27:40,840 --> 02:27:43,960
the groups that I work with understand

3567
02:27:42,478 --> 02:27:46,478
that there's really the two markets you

3568
02:27:43,959 --> 02:27:48,919
create the internal Market in your

3569
02:27:46,478 --> 02:27:50,679
country where you specialize and focus

3570
02:27:48,920 --> 02:27:54,760
on what is indigenous

3571
02:27:50,680 --> 02:27:56,398
what is your base form and then from

3572
02:27:54,760 --> 02:27:59,079
there you can create other things that

3573
02:27:56,398 --> 02:28:02,079
are hybrids to move globally that'll

3574
02:27:59,079 --> 02:28:04,760
work in supply chain shipment but

3575
02:28:02,079 --> 02:28:06,639
because the US is the destination it's

3576
02:28:04,760 --> 02:28:09,239
almost like everyone wants to throw

3577
02:28:06,639 --> 02:28:13,000
everything they're creating out and come

3578
02:28:09,239 --> 02:28:16,398
after um what sells here and it couldn't

3579
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:19,159
be a worse decision you know it it it's

3580
02:28:16,398 --> 02:28:21,760
it I'm like whoa if I went to Thailand I

3581
02:28:19,159 --> 02:28:24,359
want to smoke tie if I'm in La I want to

3582
02:28:21,760 --> 02:28:27,159
smoke louse if you sold me a [ __ ] bag

3583
02:28:24,359 --> 02:28:29,520
of white runts I'd be pissed because I

3584
02:28:27,159 --> 02:28:33,119
can buy that and anywhere in America but

3585
02:28:29,520 --> 02:28:35,040
I can't buy thae in America and I grow

3586
02:28:33,120 --> 02:28:37,680
it but it's not Thai because I don't

3587
02:28:35,040 --> 02:28:39,760
have the the sun and the back I don't

3588
02:28:37,680 --> 02:28:41,920
have the I don't have the combination to

3589
02:28:39,760 --> 02:28:45,760
make it what it is so it's an it's an

3590
02:28:41,920 --> 02:28:47,760
Americanized bastardized diminished form

3591
02:28:45,760 --> 02:28:49,000
and I know that because I I get I get to

3592
02:28:47,760 --> 02:28:52,040
[ __ ] around with all these things in

3593
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:53,639
real time so I know the difference and

3594
02:28:52,040 --> 02:28:55,439
that's really what's tough is that we're

3595
02:28:53,639 --> 02:28:59,478
all we're all so busy trying to figure

3596
02:28:55,439 --> 02:29:02,439
out how to sell weed that you're you're

3597
02:28:59,478 --> 02:29:04,760
creating the square tomato so that it

3598
02:29:02,439 --> 02:29:06,840
boxes easy it ships easy and what we're

3599
02:29:04,760 --> 02:29:08,600
losing is we're losing this diversity

3600
02:29:06,840 --> 02:29:10,398
and we're losing the ability for each

3601
02:29:08,600 --> 02:29:13,600
one of these places to have their own

3602
02:29:10,398 --> 02:29:15,478
individual identity and so same thing

3603
02:29:13,600 --> 02:29:18,000
with Colombia we're developing lines in

3604
02:29:15,478 --> 02:29:20,879
Colombia but there has to be hybrids

3605
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:22,959
that can be sold other places that

3606
02:29:20,879 --> 02:29:25,599
desire American

3607
02:29:22,959 --> 02:29:27,478
morphology and then how do you develop

3608
02:29:25,600 --> 02:29:31,439
the internal markets within the country

3609
02:29:27,478 --> 02:29:34,358
to focus on what is their cultural

3610
02:29:31,439 --> 02:29:37,359
smoke so you know like these these

3611
02:29:34,359 --> 02:29:39,200
conversations are huge and it it there

3612
02:29:37,359 --> 02:29:40,920
has to be the the farmers have to be

3613
02:29:39,200 --> 02:29:42,560
able to get together and communicate so

3614
02:29:40,920 --> 02:29:45,719
they can understand don't throw your

3615
02:29:42,559 --> 02:29:47,760
population away to become a runs farmer

3616
02:29:45,719 --> 02:29:50,159
because when runs goes away what do you

3617
02:29:47,760 --> 02:29:51,639
do you know you've You've Lost Your

3618
02:29:50,159 --> 02:29:53,359
identity and now you just basically

3619
02:29:51,639 --> 02:29:55,959
you're shill you grab whatever the

3620
02:29:53,359 --> 02:29:57,479
nursery sells and you grow it and and

3621
02:29:55,959 --> 02:29:59,119
that [ __ ] I'm telling people I'm like

3622
02:29:57,478 --> 02:30:01,199
listen they sell about 18 different

3623
02:29:59,120 --> 02:30:02,560
plants in the [ __ ] Market if you grow

3624
02:30:01,200 --> 02:30:05,000
any of those you're going out of

3625
02:30:02,559 --> 02:30:07,680
business you can't you can't compete and

3626
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:10,040
like Eric Eric similar to me where he

3627
02:30:07,680 --> 02:30:12,159
and I both go to the largest operations

3628
02:30:10,040 --> 02:30:14,600
in the United States and then I go to

3629
02:30:12,159 --> 02:30:17,239
ones out of the country that are [ __ ]

3630
02:30:14,600 --> 02:30:19,040
huge it lets you get a really good idea

3631
02:30:17,239 --> 02:30:20,639
of what your competition is and what

3632
02:30:19,040 --> 02:30:22,560
they're doing and I'm like you can't

3633
02:30:20,639 --> 02:30:24,318
compete with these guys because they can

3634
02:30:22,559 --> 02:30:26,359
get the product to the table cheaper

3635
02:30:24,318 --> 02:30:28,478
than you you have to get out of their

3636
02:30:26,359 --> 02:30:30,880
realm and you have to go into things

3637
02:30:28,478 --> 02:30:34,119
that they can't produce won't

3638
02:30:30,879 --> 02:30:36,358
produce and the the the issue with that

3639
02:30:34,120 --> 02:30:39,520
is how do we Market it but the bottom

3640
02:30:36,359 --> 02:30:41,680
line is you can't go and Chase large

3641
02:30:39,520 --> 02:30:43,239
producers as a technique when you're not

3642
02:30:41,680 --> 02:30:45,920
a large

3643
02:30:43,239 --> 02:30:47,719
producer it's it's it's that's where I

3644
02:30:45,920 --> 02:30:50,639
love the idea of the root

3645
02:30:47,719 --> 02:30:52,079
bear chem dog special PR project is that

3646
02:30:50,639 --> 02:30:53,318
what it does it allows a tremendous

3647
02:30:52,079 --> 02:30:55,398
number of people that you've brought

3648
02:30:53,318 --> 02:30:57,119
together through the regen conference to

3649
02:30:55,398 --> 02:30:58,278
be able to get access to a common

3650
02:30:57,120 --> 02:31:00,520
breeding

3651
02:30:58,279 --> 02:31:02,359
project and over the course of a year or

3652
02:31:00,520 --> 02:31:05,560
two what you come out of with all those

3653
02:31:02,359 --> 02:31:06,840
seeds is really the true outliers and

3654
02:31:05,559 --> 02:31:09,039
what you're doing is you're having

3655
02:31:06,840 --> 02:31:11,559
people from around the US and hopefully

3656
02:31:09,040 --> 02:31:14,279
Global participate in this so what you

3657
02:31:11,559 --> 02:31:17,439
have is communication participation and

3658
02:31:14,279 --> 02:31:19,319
movement of product that starts that

3659
02:31:17,439 --> 02:31:21,600
chain of events to occur where what

3660
02:31:19,318 --> 02:31:24,079
you're doing is you're using many people

3661
02:31:21,600 --> 02:31:26,720
to create things because I don't think

3662
02:31:24,079 --> 02:31:28,318
any of us are are so uniquely bright

3663
02:31:26,719 --> 02:31:30,639
we're limited you know we know what we

3664
02:31:28,318 --> 02:31:34,039
know but outside of that I I don't know

3665
02:31:30,639 --> 02:31:35,959
anything but if I have hundred of us we

3666
02:31:34,040 --> 02:31:38,319
we seem to have a far better picture on

3667
02:31:35,959 --> 02:31:41,398
what to do and and how to go forward and

3668
02:31:38,318 --> 02:31:43,439
how do we really go after the market in

3669
02:31:41,398 --> 02:31:45,239
the way we need so that the small farmer

3670
02:31:43,439 --> 02:31:47,120
has some ability to survive because

3671
02:31:45,239 --> 02:31:49,359
nobody's living on 400 bucks a pound

3672
02:31:47,120 --> 02:31:51,399
winning Cali it's running you almost

3673
02:31:49,359 --> 02:31:53,920
like by the time you're done with tax

3674
02:31:51,398 --> 02:31:56,278
and trimming you're already at [ __ ]

3675
02:31:53,920 --> 02:32:00,359
350 right so you're in the you're in

3676
02:31:56,279 --> 02:32:02,239
this range of cost that's a nickel below

3677
02:32:00,359 --> 02:32:04,359
what you're G to sell it for it's

3678
02:32:02,239 --> 02:32:06,840
impossible you can't do business like

3679
02:32:04,359 --> 02:32:09,040
that and it's killing the

3680
02:32:06,840 --> 02:32:11,040
farmer globally I don't care what

3681
02:32:09,040 --> 02:32:16,359
country I'm in it's the same

3682
02:32:11,040 --> 02:32:18,319
issue selling flowers is is the lowest

3683
02:32:16,359 --> 02:32:20,720
price that you'll get for your you know

3684
02:32:18,318 --> 02:32:22,000
for your product and so make products

3685
02:32:20,719 --> 02:32:24,239
from your

3686
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:26,318
flower yeah and that's where hash and

3687
02:32:24,239 --> 02:32:28,639
rosin you know come in because that's

3688
02:32:26,318 --> 02:32:31,879
that's a product at at the end of the

3689
02:32:28,639 --> 02:32:33,318
day and then in in some cases you can't

3690
02:32:31,879 --> 02:32:35,358
make it or maybe you don't want to

3691
02:32:33,318 --> 02:32:37,318
because it's too much infrastructure and

3692
02:32:35,359 --> 02:32:39,479
all that but um you know that's that's

3693
02:32:37,318 --> 02:32:41,398
the the idea of of there's there's

3694
02:32:39,478 --> 02:32:44,039
places in Ontario right now where their

3695
02:32:41,398 --> 02:32:46,519
pounds are $25 a pound and I just

3696
02:32:44,040 --> 02:32:48,439
talking to people out there but you know

3697
02:32:46,520 --> 02:32:50,040
the the big up to the families you know

3698
02:32:48,439 --> 02:32:51,760
out there that are you know doing and

3699
02:32:50,040 --> 02:32:54,200
hash and everything because that still

3700
02:32:51,760 --> 02:32:57,239
has value you know quite a

3701
02:32:54,200 --> 02:33:00,359
bit and taking away ability for the

3702
02:32:57,239 --> 02:33:01,439
farmer to have a value added product

3703
02:33:00,359 --> 02:33:04,520
with their

3704
02:33:01,439 --> 02:33:06,680
own you know product with their own

3705
02:33:04,520 --> 02:33:08,439
produce is ridiculous it's like telling

3706
02:33:06,680 --> 02:33:11,239
the Tomato farmer hey you know what

3707
02:33:08,439 --> 02:33:14,120
tomato farmer you can't make tomato

3708
02:33:11,239 --> 02:33:16,239
sauce when really you know maybe for

3709
02:33:14,120 --> 02:33:18,279
small tomato Farmers the only way that

3710
02:33:16,239 --> 02:33:21,639
they can actually stay a small Farmer

3711
02:33:18,279 --> 02:33:23,720
Feed their family pay their taxes is to

3712
02:33:21,639 --> 02:33:26,000
make a value added product and I just

3713
02:33:23,719 --> 02:33:28,599
think that it's again another

3714
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:30,600
restrictive policy that's put onto

3715
02:33:28,600 --> 02:33:33,318
cannabis Farmers as if we're growing

3716
02:33:30,600 --> 02:33:35,559
something other than produce or another

3717
02:33:33,318 --> 02:33:37,278
crop and I think that that's the stigma

3718
02:33:35,559 --> 02:33:39,600
that needs to be lifted and that's the

3719
02:33:37,279 --> 02:33:42,920
direction that we all need to you know

3720
02:33:39,600 --> 02:33:44,800
move into is you know the ability for us

3721
02:33:42,920 --> 02:33:47,200
to work with our sentient beings that

3722
02:33:44,799 --> 02:33:50,239
we're talking talking about from the

3723
02:33:47,200 --> 02:33:51,920
very beginning to the end so if Kevin is

3724
02:33:50,239 --> 02:33:54,239
growing something that he knows that

3725
02:33:51,920 --> 02:33:57,359
what's being put out to the market is

3726
02:33:54,239 --> 02:34:00,199
what he originally grow what he intended

3727
02:33:57,359 --> 02:34:02,520
to put out to the market to Consumers

3728
02:34:00,200 --> 02:34:06,479
that's incredibly important for Farmers

3729
02:34:02,520 --> 02:34:08,399
because we want that Essence that energy

3730
02:34:06,478 --> 02:34:11,719
of the good tasting good nutritional

3731
02:34:08,398 --> 02:34:14,079
tomato to be able to be shown to

3732
02:34:11,719 --> 02:34:15,639
community in the way that you know you

3733
02:34:14,079 --> 02:34:17,439
encompassed your energy and your

3734
02:34:15,639 --> 02:34:19,318
intention into it and if you want that's

3735
02:34:17,439 --> 02:34:21,359
important with medicine especially take

3736
02:34:19,318 --> 02:34:25,398
Ty for example like if they started

3737
02:34:21,359 --> 02:34:29,520
making products out of Thai Spices and

3738
02:34:25,398 --> 02:34:32,239
Thai roots and the atic Chinese medicine

3739
02:34:29,520 --> 02:34:34,479
mashup that happens in Thailand you know

3740
02:34:32,239 --> 02:34:36,639
I mean that you you'd find incredible

3741
02:34:34,478 --> 02:34:39,719
products coming out of there or let's

3742
02:34:36,639 --> 02:34:42,959
say Yoruba and Nigeria West Africa I

3743
02:34:39,719 --> 02:34:45,199
mean there's really important roots and

3744
02:34:42,959 --> 02:34:48,879
tonics that come from from these areas

3745
02:34:45,200 --> 02:34:51,520
and to be able to compound medicine even

3746
02:34:48,879 --> 02:34:54,119
compounding cannabis is is banned in

3747
02:34:51,520 --> 02:34:56,840
some areas so you know the ability to

3748
02:34:54,120 --> 02:34:58,720
compound cannabis with other products

3749
02:34:56,840 --> 02:35:01,439
and what he means by compounding is

3750
02:34:58,719 --> 02:35:04,959
literally just taking two herbs and

3751
02:35:01,439 --> 02:35:08,639
putting them together that's how

3752
02:35:04,959 --> 02:35:11,478
restrictive this has gotten like come on

3753
02:35:08,639 --> 02:35:15,119
sillyness they're trying to compare us

3754
02:35:11,478 --> 02:35:19,159
putting spearmint into cannabis leaves

3755
02:35:15,120 --> 02:35:22,479
for a smoking blend as to that of mixing

3756
02:35:19,159 --> 02:35:26,478
two pharmaceutical drugs to go together

3757
02:35:22,478 --> 02:35:30,679
come on we have now created Loops that

3758
02:35:26,478 --> 02:35:33,398
we can no longer fit into it is so

3759
02:35:30,680 --> 02:35:35,680
stupid humans are ridiculous we are

3760
02:35:33,398 --> 02:35:39,119
always creating these systems that we

3761
02:35:35,680 --> 02:35:41,318
can't even work in so I think that if

3762
02:35:39,120 --> 02:35:44,439
we've learned anything through these

3763
02:35:41,318 --> 02:35:47,600
last two years is we need to simp

3764
02:35:44,439 --> 02:35:50,479
simplify and we need to humanize more

3765
02:35:47,600 --> 02:35:52,760
things so that it makes it easier the

3766
02:35:50,478 --> 02:35:56,079
reason why they've complicated a system

3767
02:35:52,760 --> 02:35:59,040
is so that we have to pay somebody else

3768
02:35:56,079 --> 02:36:01,680
not only to translate it but then to be

3769
02:35:59,040 --> 02:36:03,720
able to carry out the work to do it so

3770
02:36:01,680 --> 02:36:06,720
what it does is it just takes us further

3771
02:36:03,719 --> 02:36:09,239
and further away from the work and

3772
02:36:06,719 --> 02:36:12,278
empowerment of us becoming again

3773
02:36:09,239 --> 02:36:14,559
Sovereign independent beings and this is

3774
02:36:12,279 --> 02:36:17,120
where we need to move not just in

3775
02:36:14,559 --> 02:36:20,318
Canabis not just in farming but in every

3776
02:36:17,120 --> 02:36:22,680
single occup the world I just I love

3777
02:36:20,318 --> 02:36:25,398
that that you're using that vocabulary

3778
02:36:22,680 --> 02:36:28,279
it's really really strikes me and I you

3779
02:36:25,398 --> 02:36:28,278
know identify with

3780
02:36:34,680 --> 02:36:38,840
it I

3781
02:36:36,439 --> 02:36:40,840
agree I was just when we were break we

3782
02:36:38,840 --> 02:36:43,159
were talking about hash and stuff it's

3783
02:36:40,840 --> 02:36:45,680
like I just really agree with with the

3784
02:36:43,159 --> 02:36:47,279
the direct sale and the and the you

3785
02:36:45,680 --> 02:36:50,318
taking it Beyond hash because right now

3786
02:36:47,279 --> 02:36:52,239
in Washington we're we're California's

3787
02:36:50,318 --> 02:36:54,680
kind of almost like its own country in

3788
02:36:52,239 --> 02:36:56,079
in a way you know the Cal the Cannabis

3789
02:36:54,680 --> 02:36:58,439
industry can operate because it's so

3790
02:36:56,079 --> 02:37:01,000
huge but we only have like six 700

3791
02:36:58,439 --> 02:37:03,880
farmer producers that you know

3792
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:05,760
processors and uh there is a ton of

3793
02:37:03,879 --> 02:37:07,639
folks in the hash game like everyone

3794
02:37:05,760 --> 02:37:09,800
that that used to be doing a small home

3795
02:37:07,639 --> 02:37:11,519
grow convinced the guy who was having a

3796
02:37:09,799 --> 02:37:14,278
hard time to let him you know spend 10

3797
02:37:11,520 --> 02:37:15,760
grand and put up a hash lab and so we

3798
02:37:14,279 --> 02:37:17,680
have in in the market we have really

3799
02:37:15,760 --> 02:37:20,279
high quality rosin especially you know

3800
02:37:17,680 --> 02:37:23,760
hash rosin available you know for 60

3801
02:37:20,279 --> 02:37:26,359
bucks 50 bucks a gram um that's pretty

3802
02:37:23,760 --> 02:37:29,439
decent stuff all the way up to $75 a

3803
02:37:26,359 --> 02:37:33,800
gram and if if you're in that $60 range

3804
02:37:29,439 --> 02:37:36,279
$65 range um it's only it's it's sub

3805
02:37:33,799 --> 02:37:38,199
$800 a pound to the farmer is is my

3806
02:37:36,279 --> 02:37:40,040
point when you break it down it's not

3807
02:37:38,200 --> 02:37:42,479
much and you have to have that expensive

3808
02:37:40,040 --> 02:37:44,120
lab you have to do this extra thing you

3809
02:37:42,478 --> 02:37:45,599
know what I mean it's and and you have

3810
02:37:44,120 --> 02:37:48,760
to still package it and put it all out

3811
02:37:45,600 --> 02:37:50,520
into one gram units and uh I've I've

3812
02:37:48,760 --> 02:37:52,079
really deled into do it this you know

3813
02:37:50,520 --> 02:37:54,560
this this year I used to make a lot of

3814
02:37:52,079 --> 02:37:56,200
hash back in the in the in the medical

3815
02:37:54,559 --> 02:37:57,760
days and I took a break from it and then

3816
02:37:56,200 --> 02:37:59,760
I I hoop back in this year and so I

3817
02:37:57,760 --> 02:38:01,279
broke down the economics and I have a a

3818
02:37:59,760 --> 02:38:03,318
a friend who owns a store here and he's

3819
02:38:01,279 --> 02:38:05,079
really cool and he'll sell anything I I

3820
02:38:03,318 --> 02:38:06,439
give him but you know when I start

3821
02:38:05,079 --> 02:38:07,639
working through the volume that I have

3822
02:38:06,439 --> 02:38:09,398
to do it's just kind of like a

3823
02:38:07,639 --> 02:38:12,358
non-starter I just keep coming back to

3824
02:38:09,398 --> 02:38:14,719
like I need to reduce this down to a a a

3825
02:38:12,359 --> 02:38:16,479
real neighborhood Nursery you know that

3826
02:38:14,719 --> 02:38:18,079
that people can come by my neighbors can

3827
02:38:16,478 --> 02:38:20,920
come by and they can buy some clones

3828
02:38:18,079 --> 02:38:22,920
some seedlings a couple ounces of herb

3829
02:38:20,920 --> 02:38:24,520
maybe some some honey infused honey like

3830
02:38:22,920 --> 02:38:26,760
these basic products that I'm you know

3831

working in the DM pure Network that are

3848
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:11,760

Food Network even conscious uh Meats

3850

regenerative meat growing you know and

3851
02:39:14,398 --> 02:39:18,639
and in some cases in some places in the

3852
02:39:16,439 --> 02:39:20,398
world you can't even get like say meat

3853

or raw milk

3854
02:39:20,398 --> 02:39:24,920
um you know so there to be able to

3855
02:39:22,318 --> 02:39:27,680
provide that for the community is also a

3856
02:39:24,920 --> 02:39:30,639
microbial Rich entity that you know you

3857
02:39:27,680 --> 02:39:32,680
you'd uh like to get into your body so

3858
02:39:30,639 --> 02:39:35,039
yeah mixing mix mix and matching the

3859
02:39:32,680 --> 02:39:36,680
food sovereignty along with the medicine

3860
02:39:35,040 --> 02:39:38,240
sovereignty is important and it is

3861
02:39:36,680 --> 02:39:41,760
happening you know in different parts of

3862
02:39:38,239 --> 02:39:44,079
the world um so yeah give thanks to the

3863
02:39:41,760 --> 02:39:47,000
people that are creating networks in

3864
02:39:44,079 --> 02:39:48,840
their area to you know to provide their

3865
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:50,520
their Community with intentional

3866
02:39:48,840 --> 02:39:54,079
products

3867
02:39:50,520 --> 02:39:56,120
because you know processed food is is

3868
02:39:54,079 --> 02:40:00,279
not very good for us and processed

3869
02:39:56,120 --> 02:40:00,279
medicine is not the best for us as

3870
02:40:13,279 --> 02:40:19,159
well I don't know that's uh I I I amen

3871
02:40:21,279 --> 02:40:24,880
I don't know where where we at we've

3872
02:40:22,639 --> 02:40:27,879
been going for a while two and a half

3873
02:40:24,879 --> 02:40:27,879
hours

3874
02:40:30,318 --> 02:40:34,559
nice are you talking listen

3875
02:40:35,559 --> 02:40:38,959
to go ahead

3876
02:40:39,318 --> 02:40:43,359
Josh no but anyway that and that's the

3877
02:40:41,840 --> 02:40:44,840
spirit of the regenerative conference

3878
02:40:43,359 --> 02:40:46,800
and everyone coming together is that

3879
02:40:44,840 --> 02:40:49,520
you're you're highlighting each bio

3880
02:40:46,799 --> 02:40:51,759
region and and what they can do um you

3881
02:40:49,520 --> 02:40:53,159
know and and every and on this panel

3882
02:40:51,760 --> 02:40:57,318
right now you already have people in

3883
02:40:53,159 --> 02:40:59,359
every different area and uh in Canada we

3884
02:40:57,318 --> 02:41:01,559
can't make new

3885
02:40:59,359 --> 02:41:04,000
lies you know it's just not the way the

3886
02:41:01,559 --> 02:41:06,119
law works but I mean we can we can make

3887
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:08,239
a new license but we can't alter the

3888
02:41:06,120 --> 02:41:09,960
licenses that are there currently so

3889
02:41:08,239 --> 02:41:12,079
that's the kind of work that we're

3890
02:41:09,959 --> 02:41:16,039
looking and moving forward is hey can we

3891
02:41:12,079 --> 02:41:19,719
create a new addendum a new addendum to

3892
02:41:16,040 --> 02:41:21,520
the laws to the laws because in Canada

3893
02:41:19,719 --> 02:41:24,438
is a good representation of the world

3894
02:41:21,520 --> 02:41:26,479
this is a federally legalized country

3895
02:41:24,439 --> 02:41:28,279
and um how does regenerative farming and

3896
02:41:26,478 --> 02:41:30,199
Lifestyles fit into that Federal

3897
02:41:28,279 --> 02:41:31,560
legalized you know markup and at this

3898
02:41:30,200 --> 02:41:32,880
moment it really doesn't it doesn't

3899
02:41:31,559 --> 02:41:34,719
match up and I just sort of wanted to

3900
02:41:32,879 --> 02:41:37,239
remind everybody out there that Health

3901
02:41:34,719 --> 02:41:40,239
Canada is what you know handles our

3902
02:41:37,239 --> 02:41:42,398
license here in Canada and that's like

3903
02:41:40,239 --> 02:41:45,239
our health and medical system that is

3904
02:41:42,398 --> 02:41:48,840
not our agricultural system that the the

3905
02:41:45,239 --> 02:41:51,359
Canada a has nothing to do with cannabis

3906
02:41:48,840 --> 02:41:54,000
so that can really tell you the

3907
02:41:51,359 --> 02:41:57,439
wormholes of where cannabis is going

3908
02:41:54,000 --> 02:41:59,279
which is pharmaceutical drug involved

3909
02:41:57,439 --> 02:42:01,840
because that's what they know they're

3910
02:41:59,279 --> 02:42:03,960
going with what it is that they know but

3911
02:42:01,840 --> 02:42:07,398
you know you can see how incredibly

3912
02:42:03,959 --> 02:42:09,398
detrimental this is that Canada being

3913
02:42:07,398 --> 02:42:12,519
one of the main big countries that's

3914
02:42:09,398 --> 02:42:15,478
ferally legalized cannabis has taken it

3915
02:42:12,520 --> 02:42:16,760
into a federally legalized faction of

3916
02:42:15,478 --> 02:42:19,599
the

3917
02:42:16,760 --> 02:42:22,398
pharmaceutical um trickle down if you

3918
02:42:19,600 --> 02:42:24,920
will and I just think that that's the

3919
02:42:22,398 --> 02:42:27,840
wrong way to go if we're talking about

3920
02:42:24,920 --> 02:42:30,439
small farmers so for us to be able to

3921
02:42:27,840 --> 02:42:33,439
have a conversation with the government

3922
02:42:30,439 --> 02:42:35,960
of Canada and say hey there's a whole

3923
02:42:33,439 --> 02:42:39,398
other faction of cannabis that's going

3924
02:42:35,959 --> 02:42:42,199
on that isn't just pharmaceutical grade

3925
02:42:39,398 --> 02:42:46,000
that isn't just talking about drug

3926
02:42:42,200 --> 02:42:48,680
mixing and isolation and compounding in

3927
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:52,159
in compounding isolates we're talking

3928
02:42:48,680 --> 02:42:55,439
about farming and this being used as

3929
02:42:52,159 --> 02:42:58,559
product that small farmers can have in

3930
02:42:55,439 --> 02:43:01,880
addition to their multi-op their

3931
02:42:58,559 --> 02:43:04,039
multi-products on their property so you

3932
02:43:01,879 --> 02:43:06,519
know I think that these conversations

3933
02:43:04,040 --> 02:43:09,279
are are incredibly important and

3934
02:43:06,520 --> 02:43:11,880
especially Canada because if we're able

3935
02:43:09,279 --> 02:43:14,359
to get Canada to make that movement then

3936
02:43:11,879 --> 02:43:18,039
the rest of the world looks at it oh

3937
02:43:14,359 --> 02:43:20,359
yeah hey there is a small area for

3938
02:43:18,040 --> 02:43:23,840
Farmers to be able

3939
02:43:20,359 --> 02:43:27,120
to bring up different parts

3940
02:43:23,840 --> 02:43:28,960
of you know maybe what they're trying to

3941
02:43:27,120 --> 02:43:30,279
accomplish in the federal government

3942
02:43:28,959 --> 02:43:33,679
which is basically they're not even

3943
02:43:30,279 --> 02:43:36,079
making any money in cannabis at least in

3944
02:43:33,680 --> 02:43:37,639
the way that they wanted to all of the

3945
02:43:36,079 --> 02:43:40,359
promises that these big corporate

3946
02:43:37,639 --> 02:43:42,680
entities made with health Canada they're

3947
02:43:40,359 --> 02:43:46,520
not necessarily getting that that

3948
02:43:42,680 --> 02:43:50,040
percentage back that was promised out to

3949
02:43:46,520 --> 02:43:51,560
them so even that's not working but

3950
02:43:50,040 --> 02:43:53,920
there's but there's still a network

3951
02:43:51,559 --> 02:43:56,079
there we're thankful that Canada has

3952
02:43:53,920 --> 02:43:58,680
federally legalized absolutely there's a

3953
02:43:56,079 --> 02:44:01,159
lot to work with it opens a door um

3954
02:43:58,680 --> 02:44:03,040
there are intentional businesses out

3955
02:44:01,159 --> 02:44:05,359
there coming online there is good

3956
02:44:03,040 --> 02:44:07,960
medicine I know Marcus knows works with

3957
02:44:05,359 --> 02:44:09,800
a lot of them Whistler Technologies

3958
02:44:07,959 --> 02:44:12,239
works with a lot of them more and more a

3959
02:44:09,799 --> 02:44:14,438
lot of them and you and and I know a lot

3960
02:44:12,239 --> 02:44:16,079
of regenerative Farmers that are

3961
02:44:14,439 --> 02:44:17,359
entering the the licensed producer

3962
02:44:16,079 --> 02:44:19,159
Market here in Canada that are

3963
02:44:17,359 --> 02:44:22,640
continuing to Lobby every day for

3964
02:44:19,159 --> 02:44:25,159
certain ingredients even n you know like

3965
02:44:22,639 --> 02:44:28,478
they have to Lobby to put nettles in

3966
02:44:25,159 --> 02:44:30,719
their soil you know so it becomes really

3967
02:44:28,478 --> 02:44:34,239
crazy when you're talking about

3968
02:44:30,719 --> 02:44:37,039
like sacred herbalist regenerative

3969
02:44:34,239 --> 02:44:38,318
farming and then you look at the actual

3970
02:44:37,040 --> 02:44:39,920
system you're trying to work with and

3971
02:44:38,318 --> 02:44:42,119
you're like oh [ __ ] they have and then

3972
02:44:39,920 --> 02:44:44,639
they create a hoop that's this big and

3973
02:44:42,120 --> 02:44:47,520
then they only they isolated forms of

3974
02:44:44,639 --> 02:44:51,079
ourselves can jump through

3975
02:44:47,520 --> 02:44:53,120
it sorry maybe too soon but we're

3976
02:44:51,079 --> 02:44:54,840
thankful but there's a lot to be

3977
02:44:53,120 --> 02:44:56,359
thankful for I mean it's the same thing

3978
02:44:54,840 --> 02:44:57,680
like you know when I put that post up

3979
02:44:56,359 --> 02:44:59,359
there lot there's a handful of folks

3980
02:44:57,680 --> 02:45:01,920
that are like yeah but this per this

3981
02:44:59,359 --> 02:45:03,640
type of person can can you know take

3982
02:45:01,920 --> 02:45:05,639
advantage of it or this kind type of you

3983
02:45:03,639 --> 02:45:07,920
know I'm like you know what it's it's

3984
02:45:05,639 --> 02:45:09,920
one step at a time I've literally had a

3985
02:45:07,920 --> 02:45:12,680
license recreational license for nine

3986
02:45:09,920 --> 02:45:14,279
years you know uh and it's one step at a

3987
02:45:12,680 --> 02:45:17,359
time and like I've been saying I need

3988
02:45:14,279 --> 02:45:20,079
this thing for nine years like I used to

3989
02:45:17,359 --> 02:45:22,920
sell direct tomatoes and all my products

3990
02:45:20,079 --> 02:45:25,639
in Minnesota and I used to walk into to

3991
02:45:22,920 --> 02:45:27,840
chefs and and with food and be like buy

3992
02:45:25,639 --> 02:45:29,799
it and they'd buy it for top dollar and

3993
02:45:27,840 --> 02:45:32,120
I it's it's not what I can do right now

3994
02:45:29,799 --> 02:45:33,719
so like it's I don't know I'll just go

3995
02:45:32,120 --> 02:45:36,240
off on it but

3996
02:45:33,719 --> 02:45:38,559
like and the reason why that's so

3997
02:45:36,239 --> 02:45:40,799
important is not only is it supporting

3998
02:45:38,559 --> 02:45:45,039
the small farmer but it's supporting the

3999
02:45:40,799 --> 02:45:49,039
nutrient dense fresh food that you have

4000
02:45:45,040 --> 02:45:52,520
to offer right at that time these tpin

4001
02:45:49,040 --> 02:45:54,680
of what the farmer has created off their

4002
02:45:52,520 --> 02:45:57,520
farm and the way that they want to cure

4003
02:45:54,680 --> 02:46:00,479
it is very different in the end which is

4004
02:45:57,520 --> 02:46:03,840
exactly very different than you know

4005
02:46:00,478 --> 02:46:07,639
dare I say a Rotten Tomato so much of

4006
02:46:03,840 --> 02:46:10,719
the fresh flowers or that people are

4007
02:46:07,639 --> 02:46:13,680
putting out creates a certain type of

4008
02:46:10,719 --> 02:46:16,318
Entourage medicine and then when it's on

4009
02:46:13,680 --> 02:46:18,920
the shelves it's not treated properly or

4010
02:46:16,318 --> 02:46:21,439
it's gone through another process or

4011
02:46:18,920 --> 02:46:25,478
darn if it's even contaminated with

4012
02:46:21,439 --> 02:46:28,239
another farm that isn't using uh organic

4013
02:46:25,478 --> 02:46:32,039
things at the very least it can cause so

4014
02:46:28,239 --> 02:46:34,879
many problems and to me that's really

4015
02:46:32,040 --> 02:46:38,399
just the same as going

4016
02:46:34,879 --> 02:46:40,839
to a market with a bunch of rotten

4017
02:46:38,398 --> 02:46:43,278
tomatoes and saying this is what I have

4018
02:46:40,840 --> 02:46:45,359
to offer the market it isn't

4019
02:46:43,279 --> 02:46:49,439
representative of the small farmer and

4020
02:46:45,359 --> 02:46:52,559
it is only harming us to be able to

4021
02:46:49,439 --> 02:46:54,680
have value in you know the history I

4022
02:46:52,559 --> 02:46:59,278
mean into the future of what small

4023
02:46:54,680 --> 02:46:59,279
farming should even have capab and how

4024
02:47:05,239 --> 02:47:10,119
dare I honestly will not eat tomatoes

4025
02:47:08,239 --> 02:47:11,639
that are store-bought like even at the

4026
02:47:10,120 --> 02:47:13,200
we at the we shop at the co-op and they

4027
02:47:11,639 --> 02:47:15,478
had good food and I know most the

4028
02:47:13,200 --> 02:47:18,040
farmers but the tomatoes that they have

4029
02:47:15,478 --> 02:47:19,639
to grow for them to sit for a week don't

4030
02:47:18,040 --> 02:47:22,520
[ __ ] drive with my

4031
02:47:19,639 --> 02:47:23,840
mouth like I don't [ __ ] want them you

4032
02:47:22,520 --> 02:47:25,640
know I'll only buy the stuff at the

4033
02:47:23,840 --> 02:47:28,120
farmers market or grow my own you know

4034
02:47:25,639 --> 02:47:29,879
and it's I basically don't eat tomatoes

4035
02:47:28,120 --> 02:47:31,279
unless I've grow them because up here

4036
02:47:29,879 --> 02:47:33,879
folks you know they have all sorts of

4037
02:47:31,279 --> 02:47:36,960
greenhous and how many of us would say

4038
02:47:33,879 --> 02:47:39,398
that as cultivators of cannabis we

4039
02:47:36,959 --> 02:47:42,000
really only smoke what's super close to

4040
02:47:39,398 --> 02:47:44,719
us and ingest what's super close to us

4041
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:47,159
because we know we know it that we know

4042
02:47:44,719 --> 02:47:49,719
it it has the value it has the flavor

4043
02:47:47,159 --> 02:47:52,680
that we're all looking for even for us

4044
02:47:49,719 --> 02:47:55,959
to want to smoke somebody else's product

4045
02:47:52,680 --> 02:47:58,079
you know it it's to me the same as that

4046
02:47:55,959 --> 02:48:00,159
tomato that even though it may be good

4047
02:47:58,079 --> 02:48:03,318
it's been on the shelf for a really long

4048
02:48:00,159 --> 02:48:06,039
time to finally get to the consumer so

4049
02:48:03,318 --> 02:48:08,318
we need to have a lot of compassion for

4050
02:48:06,040 --> 02:48:12,120
consumers in the Cannabis Market

4051
02:48:08,318 --> 02:48:14,039
especially in Canada not receiving what

4052
02:48:12,120 --> 02:48:16,760
it is that the producers or the

4053
02:48:14,040 --> 02:48:18,479
cultivators even wanted to put out and

4054
02:48:16,760 --> 02:48:21,800
to shout up to Tomato a little bit our

4055
02:48:18,478 --> 02:48:24,239
friend at PE seedlings uh grew 200

4056
02:48:21,799 --> 02:48:27,719
different strains of

4057
02:48:24,239 --> 02:48:31,600
tomatoes so wow seedings

4058
02:48:27,719 --> 02:48:34,000
200 yeah yeah peace seedlings

4059
02:48:31,600 --> 02:48:36,479
blogspot.com you can find incredible

4060
02:48:34,000 --> 02:48:38,600
food seeds and they've been growing 200

4061
02:48:36,478 --> 02:48:40,959
different varietal of tomatoes for about

4062
02:48:38,600 --> 02:48:45,640
40 years along with Incredible flower

4063
02:48:40,959 --> 02:48:48,000
variet where's their Farm corval Coral

4064
02:48:45,639 --> 02:48:50,519
nice I'll definitely check it out yeah

4065
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:53,439
and there their father Alan capill we

4066
02:48:50,520 --> 02:48:57,760
had on on hash church one time uh he's a

4067
02:48:53,439 --> 02:48:59,720
genetic biologist uh in his 70s and PE

4068
02:48:57,760 --> 02:49:02,159
seeds was his company and his kids run

4069
02:48:59,719 --> 02:49:04,119
peace seedlings so everyone should know

4070
02:49:02,159 --> 02:49:07,119
about Alan cular

4071
02:49:04,120 --> 02:49:10,040
anded the as if we're we're talking

4072
02:49:07,120 --> 02:49:13,760
about all these incredible varietals of

4073
02:49:10,040 --> 02:49:18,080
cannabis because we can because it's

4074
02:49:13,760 --> 02:49:19,840
still here because it's still relevant

4075
02:49:18,079 --> 02:49:23,238
to cons

4076
02:49:19,840 --> 02:49:26,000
consumers you know fast forward us

4077
02:49:23,238 --> 02:49:28,680
talking about you know 70 different

4078
02:49:26,000 --> 02:49:30,159
varietals of broccoli we would lose all

4079
02:49:28,680 --> 02:49:32,720
of the people who are listening right

4080
02:49:30,159 --> 02:49:34,719
now and just the same as if 20 years

4081
02:49:32,719 --> 02:49:36,719
down the road we're talking about all

4082
02:49:34,719 --> 02:49:38,238
these different varietals that have now

4083
02:49:36,719 --> 02:49:40,799
been crisper

4084
02:49:38,238 --> 02:49:42,279
technology in Israel right now but

4085
02:49:40,799 --> 02:49:44,639
they're going to put out four different

4086
02:49:42,279 --> 02:49:46,279
varietals of cannabis where all of these

4087
02:49:44,639 --> 02:49:49,840
70 different varietals that we're

4088
02:49:46,279 --> 02:49:51,800
talking about right now have no value in

4089
02:49:49,840 --> 02:49:54,238
people's minds they have no idea what

4090
02:49:51,799 --> 02:49:56,840
we're talking about but yet this is

4091
02:49:54,238 --> 02:49:59,639
what's going to bring us to the Future

4092
02:49:56,840 --> 02:50:01,760
so that's why it's so important that we

4093
02:49:59,639 --> 02:50:04,119
continue to bring this forward because

4094
02:50:01,760 --> 02:50:06,439
we know the degradation that has

4095
02:50:04,120 --> 02:50:08,319
happened to the food industry for us to

4096
02:50:06,439 --> 02:50:11,040
only have four different varial of

4097
02:50:08,318 --> 02:50:13,439
broccoli and we don't believe in editing

4098
02:50:11,040 --> 02:50:16,760
the Genome of foods through crisper

4099
02:50:13,439 --> 02:50:20,318
technology we believe in bigging up the

4100
02:50:16,760 --> 02:50:23,439
genome through regenerative culture seed

4101
02:50:20,318 --> 02:50:26,600
saving that's our future our future is

4102
02:50:23,439 --> 02:50:30,318
in the unknown the soil microbiome and

4103
02:50:26,600 --> 02:50:33,479
how endid bacteria and fungi store

4104
02:50:30,318 --> 02:50:35,760
themselves in seeds to create a new you

4105
02:50:33,478 --> 02:50:39,000
know plant the following year and yes we

4106
02:50:35,760 --> 02:50:40,760
do believe that it's a short track to

4107
02:50:39,000 --> 02:50:43,079
health and well-being of the cannabis

4108
02:50:40,760 --> 02:50:44,719
plant in the same way that antibiotics

4109
02:50:43,079 --> 02:50:46,079
is a short track to the health and

4110
02:50:44,719 --> 02:50:49,238
well-being of our

4111
02:50:46,079 --> 02:50:51,318
microbiology I said it I'm sorry I know

4112
02:50:49,238 --> 02:50:53,639
that humans love to go down these long

4113
02:50:51,318 --> 02:50:57,000
roads of science but when we start

4114
02:50:53,639 --> 02:50:59,879
crisper technology you know all of the

4115
02:50:57,000 --> 02:51:02,398
varietals that have taken our ancestry

4116
02:50:59,879 --> 02:51:06,079
thousands of years to get here and we

4117
02:51:02,398 --> 02:51:09,079
just maybe ruin it with some great idea

4118
02:51:06,079 --> 02:51:11,120
that the human has when we really have

4119
02:51:09,079 --> 02:51:15,359
no idea what's going to happen to the

4120
02:51:11,120 --> 02:51:18,960
future of those seeds so even though we

4121
02:51:15,359 --> 02:51:22,120
can look into you know a very small

4122
02:51:18,959 --> 02:51:24,719
picture of what this may do it's awesome

4123
02:51:22,120 --> 02:51:27,079
to have questions about it but what we

4124
02:51:24,719 --> 02:51:29,519
continue seeing is that those questions

4125
02:51:27,079 --> 02:51:33,000
now are taking over industry right left

4126
02:51:29,520 --> 02:51:35,560
and center it's not just oh let us

4127
02:51:33,000 --> 02:51:39,000
question because we have these ideas but

4128
02:51:35,559 --> 02:51:41,799
when it then takes over an entire

4129
02:51:39,000 --> 02:51:44,719
industry then you realize it's not just

4130
02:51:41,799 --> 02:51:48,199
us questioning it the how what and why

4131
02:51:44,719 --> 02:51:50,879
because we are curious It's because it's

4132
02:51:48,200 --> 02:51:54,120
there take over the world and and we

4133
02:51:50,879 --> 02:51:56,599
really need to see that that is

4134
02:51:54,120 --> 02:51:58,239
happening earlier I was going to pop in

4135
02:51:56,600 --> 02:52:01,238
and say you know there's kind of a a

4136
02:51:58,238 --> 02:52:03,318
thing there's folks will kind of Judge

4137
02:52:01,238 --> 02:52:05,119
you on Instagram or social media if

4138
02:52:03,318 --> 02:52:07,639
you're if folk if there's a breeder

4139
02:52:05,120 --> 02:52:09,600
that's taking an F2 in or F3 in or F4 in

4140
02:52:07,639 --> 02:52:11,920
someone else's thing and you hear people

4141
02:52:09,600 --> 02:52:13,920
talk down on it and it's like I really

4142
02:52:11,920 --> 02:52:15,719
don't hold that belief whatsoever I

4143
02:52:13,920 --> 02:52:17,799
think there is significant value I was

4144
02:52:15,719 --> 02:52:19,238
going to say it when Nick was on to

4145
02:52:17,799 --> 02:52:20,639
taking something if you think it's

4146
02:52:19,238 --> 02:52:22,279
really cool and it worked really well

4147
02:52:20,639 --> 02:52:24,358
for you or you want have potential for

4148
02:52:22,279 --> 02:52:27,040
it to to take it down those lines and

4149
02:52:24,359 --> 02:52:29,760
hold it and remake it year after year

4150
02:52:27,040 --> 02:52:33,279
because in my experience it takes two or

4151
02:52:29,760 --> 02:52:36,719
three seasons or grows uh for a genetic

4152
02:52:33,279 --> 02:52:37,880
to really jive with the biology you know

4153
02:52:36,719 --> 02:52:40,199
and

4154
02:52:37,879 --> 02:52:42,398
like you know that that's true of of

4155
02:52:40,200 --> 02:52:44,040
human beings too when when when we move

4156
02:52:42,398 --> 02:52:46,079
and move into different environments

4157
02:52:44,040 --> 02:52:48,840
different places it takes people get

4158
02:52:46,079 --> 02:52:50,359
sick often you know in the first while

4159
02:52:48,840 --> 02:52:51,840
takes their biome especially if you

4160
02:52:50,359 --> 02:52:53,720
drastically move to a different part of

4161
02:52:51,840 --> 02:52:56,920
the world you know you could really [ __ ]

4162
02:52:53,719 --> 02:52:59,398
you up um you know so it's just a to

4163
02:52:56,920 --> 02:53:01,279
consider like to to not get rid of that

4164
02:52:59,398 --> 02:53:03,719
machismo thing or whatever the [ __ ] it

4165
02:53:01,279 --> 02:53:05,439
is and like make seeds you know like and

4166
02:53:03,719 --> 02:53:07,358
that's why I always I I I appreciate

4167
02:53:05,439 --> 02:53:08,720
hearing about peace seedlings because

4168
02:53:07,359 --> 02:53:11,200
I've always bought like from Uprising

4169
02:53:08,719 --> 02:53:13,398
seeds here in Bellingham area and they

4170
02:53:11,200 --> 02:53:15,399
grow only open pollinated seeds and i'

4171
02:53:13,398 --> 02:53:17,079
I've been growing those seeds for so

4172
02:53:15,398 --> 02:53:20,159
many years I can't remember you know

4173
02:53:17,079 --> 02:53:22,600
making theth generation and you know

4174
02:53:20,159 --> 02:53:25,200
it's it's something of significant value

4175
02:53:22,600 --> 02:53:27,640
to me because it it it's it's embodied

4176
02:53:25,200 --> 02:53:29,560
with not only within me and and the food

4177
02:53:27,639 --> 02:53:30,879
tastes good to me but it's it does well

4178
02:53:29,559 --> 02:53:32,760
in my environment and it's something

4179
02:53:30,879 --> 02:53:34,959
that I can pass on you know that I've

4180
02:53:32,760 --> 02:53:36,920
maybe improve this just for this region

4181
02:53:34,959 --> 02:53:39,159
and just for this technique that's all

4182
02:53:36,920 --> 02:53:42,879
that's enough you know or or kept it

4183
02:53:39,159 --> 02:53:42,879
alive and kept it around go ahead

4184
02:53:43,719 --> 02:53:49,559
Josh I also agree that it's climatizing

4185
02:53:47,120 --> 02:53:51,079
you know to an area so it's not to say

4186
02:53:49,559 --> 02:53:52,519
that you know it's you shouldn't grow

4187
02:53:51,079 --> 02:53:53,959
someone else's seeds of course you

4188
02:53:52,520 --> 02:53:56,560
should because that's the whole entire

4189
02:53:53,959 --> 02:53:59,959
point of making seeds you can say hey

4190
02:53:56,559 --> 02:54:03,039
the origins of this came from Pacific

4191
02:53:59,959 --> 02:54:06,559
Northwest Roots Ross kapul you know or

4192
02:54:03,040 --> 02:54:08,399
Nick or you know whoever it came from

4193
02:54:06,559 --> 02:54:09,680
and then that's that's that's nice

4194
02:54:08,398 --> 02:54:11,398
because then it's being gracious then

4195
02:54:09,680 --> 02:54:13,600
you're giving you know small farmer

4196
02:54:11,398 --> 02:54:16,358
maybe it's Kevin JRE you know or or

4197
02:54:13,600 --> 02:54:18,079
whatever and you can continue you know

4198
02:54:16,359 --> 02:54:19,960
the the the representation of where it

4199
02:54:18,079 --> 02:54:21,359
came from but being able to climatize

4200
02:54:19,959 --> 02:54:23,478
the seed like you said is really

4201
02:54:21,359 --> 02:54:25,159
powerful and it makes it you know even

4202
02:54:23,478 --> 02:54:28,159
taste a little different for the zone

4203
02:54:25,159 --> 02:54:29,879
and that's that gives a Zone value I

4204
02:54:28,159 --> 02:54:32,799
think Kevin brings that up a lot you

4205
02:54:29,879 --> 02:54:36,199
know you know you got to find Value and

4206
02:54:32,799 --> 02:54:37,000
and value is not homogenization value is

4207
02:54:36,200 --> 02:54:39,720
is

4208
02:54:37,000 --> 02:54:42,079
uniqueness um and and climatization

4209
02:54:39,719 --> 02:54:45,959
brings on the uniqueness of of Any Given

4210
02:54:42,079 --> 02:54:49,200
flavor so yes we encourage anyone to

4211
02:54:45,959 --> 02:54:51,438
always grow out the seeds um and and and

4212
02:54:49,200 --> 02:54:53,680
and of course you know like you know do

4213
02:54:51,439 --> 02:54:55,639
something with them if you feel called

4214
02:54:53,680 --> 02:54:58,479
to it you know that's that's a beautiful

4215
02:54:55,639 --> 02:55:02,000
thing so that's why seed swaps are

4216
02:54:58,478 --> 02:55:05,799
powerful and that's part of us as human

4217
02:55:02,000 --> 02:55:08,719
beings sifting through these seeds to

4218
02:55:05,799 --> 02:55:10,679
create incredibly beautiful varietals in

4219
02:55:08,719 --> 02:55:13,119
the same way that a lot of these

4220
02:55:10,680 --> 02:55:15,880
scientists with this crisper technology

4221
02:55:13,120 --> 02:55:18,399
are trying to create something so our

4222
02:55:15,879 --> 02:55:21,759
ability as Community to breathe through

4223
02:55:18,398 --> 02:55:24,680
some really fire genetics that may have

4224
02:55:21,760 --> 02:55:27,318
you know a a lot of Tendencies towards

4225
02:55:24,680 --> 02:55:30,359
powdery mildew or other Leaf feeding

4226
02:55:27,318 --> 02:55:32,559
fungi you know if we continue to trade

4227
02:55:30,359 --> 02:55:34,920
them and we put them in different areas

4228
02:55:32,559 --> 02:55:37,199
and regions then we're going to find an

4229
02:55:34,920 --> 02:55:40,040
area in a region and a farmer that grows

4230
02:55:37,200 --> 02:55:43,159
it out really well to be able to keep

4231
02:55:40,040 --> 02:55:44,760
that you know varietal present because

4232
02:55:43,159 --> 02:55:46,680
just like you were saying Joshua you

4233
02:55:44,760 --> 02:55:49,639
know like nobody's talking about the

4234
02:55:46,680 --> 02:55:52,279
Tomato we need to talk about the plant

4235
02:55:49,639 --> 02:55:54,599
as an entity too a lot of us are talking

4236
02:55:52,279 --> 02:55:56,880
about the manipulation of the plant and

4237
02:55:54,600 --> 02:55:59,159
all of the different varietals that we

4238
02:55:56,879 --> 02:56:03,000
can create with the plant but we need to

4239
02:55:59,159 --> 02:56:05,238
always pull up a chair for the plant

4240
02:56:03,000 --> 02:56:09,799
that the plant is is is what's important

4241
02:56:05,238 --> 02:56:12,318
and moving forward viate all of her

4242
02:56:09,799 --> 02:56:15,000
potentialities in the medicine that we

4243
02:56:12,318 --> 02:56:17,920
ingest then all we're doing is doing her

4244
02:56:15,000 --> 02:56:19,840
a favor and we're true stewards of the

4245
02:56:17,920 --> 02:56:22,760
plant and that's and that's what we

4246
02:56:19,840 --> 02:56:25,600
really need to be doing stewards of

4247
02:56:22,760 --> 02:56:27,680
every single seed that we create because

4248
02:56:25,600 --> 02:56:29,680
that's creating that's that's completing

4249
02:56:27,680 --> 02:56:31,960
the whole cycle of what regeneration

4250
02:56:29,680 --> 02:56:31,960
even

4251
02:56:32,359 --> 02:56:37,439
means the other the other thing I wanted

4252
02:56:34,760 --> 02:56:39,880
to add to the the regenerative talk too

4253
02:56:37,439 --> 02:56:42,000
was I learned more of the first year and

4254
02:56:39,879 --> 02:56:45,438
back in I was it 2018 was the first year

4255
02:56:42,000 --> 02:56:46,840
of the region conference Josh um I

4256
02:56:45,439 --> 02:56:48,359
learned more at that first meeting in

4257
02:56:46,840 --> 02:56:50,600
Portland than I did in probably the

4258
02:56:48,359 --> 02:56:52,159
previous 5 to 10 years of going to other

4259
02:56:50,600 --> 02:56:54,079
cannabis and agricultural conventions

4260
02:56:52,159 --> 02:56:56,000
and listening to talks it was just this

4261
02:56:54,079 --> 02:56:57,799
wholly different level and people are

4262
02:56:56,000 --> 02:56:59,439
hanging out at dinner talking science

4263
02:56:57,799 --> 02:57:00,719
talking you know all these different

4264
02:56:59,439 --> 02:57:02,238
methodologies it's a completely

4265
02:57:00,719 --> 02:57:03,358
different kind of experience than any

4266
02:57:02,238 --> 02:57:05,478
other kind of conference you're going to

4267
02:57:03,359 --> 02:57:06,800
go to and you'll learn more about more

4268
02:57:05,478 --> 02:57:09,358
different things that you didn't know

4269
02:57:06,799 --> 02:57:10,920
exist that'll help you have insight into

4270
02:57:09,359 --> 02:57:12,439
why your plants are doing that weird

4271
02:57:10,920 --> 02:57:15,520
thing that you didn't can't quite figure

4272
02:57:12,439 --> 02:57:17,398
out or why you know X Y and Z and it

4273
02:57:15,520 --> 02:57:19,000
certainly will will uh open a whole lot

4274
02:57:17,398 --> 02:57:20,599
of new doors for you and help you figure

4275
02:57:19,000 --> 02:57:22,879
out some stuff that you you were

4276
02:57:20,600 --> 02:57:25,680
struggling with before for

4277
02:57:22,879 --> 02:57:27,438
sure I there's been a lot of folks that

4278
02:57:25,680 --> 02:57:29,639
it's that came to the first couple years

4279
02:57:27,439 --> 02:57:32,079
that are now like in career you know

4280
02:57:29,639 --> 02:57:34,760
Consultants running big grows when they

4281
02:57:32,079 --> 02:57:34,760
first came in

4282
02:57:35,520 --> 02:57:40,000
not the connections and the and the kind

4283
02:57:37,920 --> 02:57:42,159
of lead off and the base really did lead

4284
02:57:40,000 --> 02:57:44,040
does lead you know like I think if I was

4285
02:57:42,159 --> 02:57:45,279
going to advise someone that was 2020

4286
02:57:44,040 --> 02:57:46,560
whatever trying to figure out and I want

4287
02:57:45,279 --> 02:57:49,800
to be in the career I'd say hit the

4288
02:57:46,559 --> 02:57:51,000
ganier hit all the regen conferences try

4289
02:57:49,799 --> 02:57:52,920
to figure out how to get demure

4290
02:57:51,000 --> 02:57:54,359
certified and [ __ ] you know you'll

4291
02:57:52,920 --> 02:57:57,279
have all that you need right there to go

4292
02:57:54,359 --> 02:57:57,279
figure it out you

4293
02:57:57,600 --> 02:58:05,000
know hey I got a split guys my uh my my

4294
02:58:01,799 --> 02:58:07,238
human seed is demanding some

4295
02:58:05,000 --> 02:58:08,799
attention so I want to say thanks Marcus

4296
02:58:07,238 --> 02:58:10,760
for letting me be on your platform I

4297
02:58:08,799 --> 02:58:13,079
appreciate you Josh for uh inviting me

4298
02:58:10,760 --> 02:58:14,719
on to speak and it's like I said it's

4299
02:58:13,079 --> 02:58:17,559
always an honor to hang out with all of

4300
02:58:14,719 --> 02:58:19,079
you you're uh you're all wonderful

4301
02:58:17,559 --> 02:58:20,799
people and it's just a blessing to be

4302
02:58:19,079 --> 02:58:22,639
part of your crew so thank you so much

4303
02:58:20,799 --> 02:58:24,799
and I look forward to seeing you all a

4304
02:58:22,639 --> 02:58:26,719
couple weeks in Humble and I'll I'll

4305
02:58:24,799 --> 02:58:28,398
I'll bring you ounce of OG Eric I got

4306
02:58:26,719 --> 02:58:30,398
some killer OG you're gonna love that

4307
02:58:28,398 --> 02:58:32,719
[ __ ] I got you sa me a [ __ ] a save me

4308
02:58:30,398 --> 02:58:34,799

02:59:54,840 --> 03:00:00,200

more doors that we can push her through

4361
03:00:49,079 --> 03:00:53,639

03:02:46,879 --> 03:02:51,559
great to listen to today Steve was

4412
03:02:49,200 --> 03:02:54,200
helping me in the background uh with

4413
03:02:51,559 --> 03:02:55,799
some uh sort of Zoom co-hosting things

4414
03:02:54,200 --> 03:02:57,640
so we're going to be able to figure out

4415
03:02:55,799 --> 03:02:59,398
maybe so hash Church doesn't have to

4416
03:02:57,639 --> 03:03:01,318
change links when it goes live it's

4417
03:02:59,398 --> 03:03:03,559
going to help me figure that out so

4418
03:03:01,318 --> 03:03:05,639
shout out to him for that and yeah thank

4419
03:03:03,559 --> 03:03:07,318
you guys for you know doing this today

4420
03:03:05,639 --> 03:03:10,439
on here it was really really nice to

4421
03:03:07,318 --> 03:03:13,079
listen to everyone it was neat to hear a

4422
03:03:10,439 --> 03:03:14,559
group of people who seemingly you know

4423
03:03:13,079 --> 03:03:17,120
have this great information and

4424
03:03:14,559 --> 03:03:19,159
knowledge but even some of the things

4425
03:03:17,120 --> 03:03:21,040
like when Kevin spoke and what he spoke

4426
03:03:19,159 --> 03:03:23,238
about and how honest he was about how he

4427
03:03:21,040 --> 03:03:26,520
spoke it and then Nicholas really kind

4428
03:03:23,238 --> 03:03:30,359
of quite different it was uh it was nice

4429
03:03:26,520 --> 03:03:32,200
to see people not necessarily agreeing

4430
03:03:30,359 --> 03:03:34,318
but sharing different points of

4431
03:03:32,200 --> 03:03:37,239
perspective without like getting on one

4432
03:03:34,318 --> 03:03:39,680
another and just staying true to the

4433
03:03:37,238 --> 03:03:42,238
topics I it was really refreshing I

4434
03:03:39,680 --> 03:03:44,120
appreciated it it's something that we

4435
03:03:42,238 --> 03:03:45,680
we've we've strived for and like because

4436
03:03:44,120 --> 03:03:48,720
there is a lot of there can be a lot of

4437
03:03:45,680 --> 03:03:51,960
little micro Nicky stuff within within

4438
03:03:48,719 --> 03:03:53,478
subcultures and um you know even in our

4439
03:03:51,959 --> 03:03:55,559
conference there's there's there's

4440
03:03:53,478 --> 03:03:57,679
conflict between k&amp;f and soil food web

4441
03:03:55,559 --> 03:03:59,600
and but uh we we really just do a good

4442
03:03:57,680 --> 03:04:01,120
job of of talking it through and I think

4443
03:03:59,600 --> 03:04:03,359
we'll kind of move past that at this

4444
03:04:01,120 --> 03:04:04,920
point but that was a thing uh there for

4445
03:04:03,359 --> 03:04:06,720
you know it's things like that and I I

4446
03:04:04,920 --> 03:04:08,920
you know I just really appreciate all

4447
03:04:06,719 --> 03:04:11,278
the speakers even you know just just

4448
03:04:08,920 --> 03:04:13,600
willing to hold space with each other

4449
03:04:11,279 --> 03:04:14,960
and learn from each other and um that's

4450
03:04:13,600 --> 03:04:16,640
been uh you know one of the biggest

4451
03:04:14,959 --> 03:04:18,278
blessings is being able to take

4452
03:04:16,639 --> 03:04:20,959
everybody out to dinner after afterwards

4453
03:04:18,279 --> 03:04:22,760
and just uh drink a beer and listen to

4454
03:04:20,959 --> 03:04:24,639
people learn and from each other you

4455
03:04:22,760 --> 03:04:26,520
know and and and discuss and there's

4456
03:04:24,639 --> 03:04:28,119
there's contradictions and and

4457
03:04:26,520 --> 03:04:29,840
understanding and it's it's been

4458
03:04:28,120 --> 03:04:32,160
powerful how we how we kind of figure it

4459
03:04:29,840 --> 03:04:34,279
out together you know um I I know for

4460
03:04:32,159 --> 03:04:36,318
sure every speaker has changed their

4461
03:04:34,279 --> 03:04:37,680
vocabulary and their understanding from

4462
03:04:36,318 --> 03:04:38,680
those from those meetings and it's been

4463
03:04:37,680 --> 03:04:41,680
really

4464
03:04:38,680 --> 03:04:41,680
powerful

4465
03:04:42,719 --> 03:04:48,119
so awesome well if that's it thanks

4466
03:04:45,478 --> 03:04:50,879

4467
03:04:48,120 --> 03:04:53,399
recording and shut down YouTube and uh
