1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,080
okay so moving on to the bubble bags

2
00:00:03,388 --> 00:00:10,650
originals eight colors we got them right

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:16,948
here the originals blue the to 20 micron

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:19,859
bag the green 190 bag the red 160 micron

5
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:23,070

6
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:27,449

7
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,698
white 45 and the purple 25 micron the

8
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:33,780
bubble bags original are still untouched

9
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:35,910
in the marketplace for quality really

10
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:38,100
it's since day one I always went with

11
00:00:35,909 --> 00:00:39,479
the nicest highest gsm thread count I

12
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,558
could go with the highest grade

13
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:46,500
pharmaceutical screen whether night XR

14
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:49,799
polyethylene parachute thread to sew the

15
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:52,820
two together just really never cut any

16
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:55,229
corners in the manufacturing and in the

17
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:56,820
materials that were purchased these

18
00:00:55,229 --> 00:00:58,140
materials are all purchased in different

19
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,179
countries and then flown to another

20
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:03,299
country because the that's where the

21
00:01:00,179 --> 00:01:06,629
best sewing job gets done so all these

22
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:08,548
things correlate to a higher-end product

23
00:01:06,629 --> 00:01:11,129
that's why we put the lifetime warranty

24
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:14,400
on it we know that these bags will last

25
00:01:11,129 --> 00:01:16,228
for you know between 10 and 20 years no

26
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,030
problem and I wouldn't be surprised one

27
00:01:16,228 --> 00:01:20,879
day when the company is older than 15

28
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:24,150
years if we hear there's bags that made

29
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:26,368
it 30 40 years on my Facebook page just

30
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:30,000
yesterday a gentlemen posted a set of

31
00:01:26,368 --> 00:01:32,040
his 12 year old bags from 2001 all

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,659
stacked inside a bucket and showing all

33
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,970
the labels nicely and just saying you

34
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:39,359
know still in great use so it's great to

35
00:01:35,969 --> 00:01:41,819
see that the bubble bags they still

36
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:43,769
demand a high price but they are

37
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:46,349
respected in the industry they're the

38
00:01:43,769 --> 00:01:49,199
tool of many of the top quality extract

39
00:01:46,349 --> 00:01:50,750
artists out there and people respect

40
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,810
bubble bags people like bubble bags

41
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:56,509
along with the quality along with the

42
00:01:53,810 --> 00:02:01,200
material we also offer top

43
00:01:56,509 --> 00:02:02,609
top-of-the-line customer service like I

44
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,930
said when you offer something like a

45
00:02:02,609 --> 00:02:06,010
lifetime warranty it's best to make it

46
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:07,570
easier for your customers to

47
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:09,219
actually get that lifetime warranty

48
00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:11,319
rather than make it difficult for them

49
00:02:09,219 --> 00:02:12,759
so we usually just ask a few little

50
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:14,379
questions here in there but if the bags

51
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:16,149
have been defective in any way shape or

52
00:02:14,379 --> 00:02:19,240
form we urge you to get in touch with us

53
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:21,520
and we'll replace them so thanks for

54
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,409
tuning in here today with me a beautiful

55
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,409
beautiful day here in British Columbia

56
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:29,340
and I'll finish off with showing you a

57
00:02:26,409 --> 00:02:29,340
little bit of the sunset
