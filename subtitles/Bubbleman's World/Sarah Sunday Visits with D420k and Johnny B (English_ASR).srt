just dry SI roll to damn near Perfection

25
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:20,798
that is you should really get in there

26
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:23,959
at the camera and show the camera what

27
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:26,759
it looks like wow look at actually here

28
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:28,239
bring the camera a little closer so you

29
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:30,439
guys can see what we're talking about

30
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:32,640
here

31
00:01:30,438 --> 00:01:34,639
it grabbing it get it on the end so they

32
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,640
can see the little

33
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:40,920
spiral yeah yeah getting up and looking

34
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,960
at that well it is beautiful it's a work

35
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,439
of a master work you know what you know

36
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:46,039
there a lot of art that goes into making

37
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:47,199
a pure H joint that's for sure

38
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,799
definitely care and attention I think

39
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,640
you've talked about it yeah a little bit

40
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,719
you know my friend that makes them does

41
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,399
a wonderful job he's been making them

42
00:01:52,718 --> 00:01:58,158
for like 12 years at this point in time

43
00:01:55,399 --> 00:01:59,519
and I say we smoke it I think that's

44
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,520
probably a really good idea a nice

45
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:03,798
little on the end of The Joint look at

46
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:06,000
that nice blue smoke coming off of it

47
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:09,080
instantly very

48
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,680
blue nice and dense looking I love how

49
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:14,000
when you blew on that the smoke went

50
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,400
through the other end like nor when you

51
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,840
blow on the end of a joint and it just

52
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:22,039
kind of go you blew on that just blew

53
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,039
right the other end like yeah it's

54
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:28,799
like well there you go Sarah welcome to

55

00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:42,560
we've had a pretty epic summer this year

61
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:44,359
nicer than uh usual oh beautiful summer

62
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,479

weather basically and we've gotten your

64
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:52,399
weather it's been shitty and cold and

65
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:55,920
cold at night such a burn cu the winter

66
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,400
was so harsh too know right [ __ ] that

67
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:59,679
barely got to

68
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,760
30° they let me past yeah I just got

69
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,080
back back from Jamaica and I have to say

70
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:07,079
it is you know as hot right now right

71
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,760
here as it was when I left really really

72
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,360
oh when you left yes it hasn't changed I

73
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:12,399
was going to say cuz Jamaica what was it

74
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,799
like it looked like it rained a little

75
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,080
bit there for you uh we got a little bit

76
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:17,799
of rain it was nice it hadn't rained in

77
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,719
like over 13 weeks in some of the

78
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:22,560
parishes so they were very very happy to

79
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:24,878
have uh that rainfall there while we

80
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,120
were there and of course we were joking

81
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:28,318
that we brought the

82
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:30,519
rain who brought the rain man come on

83
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:33,119
there you go rain maker and he ended

84
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:36,039
giddy actually told me that he he done

85
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,519
some turtle thing that he drew in the

86
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:40,318
sand or something I don't know what it

87
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,640
was about some rain look at the ash on

88
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:44,919
that by the way you should probably show

89
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:46,479
the camera how lovely the ash is nice

90
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:48,518
color I don't want to put it too close

91
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:51,598
cuz then we lose the Sun but it's a nice

92
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:54,799
white ash there you go this looks very

93
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:57,119
fine and mhm like like it would be just

94
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:59,280
like the lightest dust you don't really

95
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,079
get a chance really I think it's um

96
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,560
maybe we can um learn how we can all

97
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:05,280
make our own house strengths at home oh

98
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:07,479
wouldn't that be great I'd love to know

99
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,919
how I'd love to know all your tricks cuz

100
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:11,518
I'm sure you're very I did a post on

101
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:13,158
Facebook that definitely inspired a lot

102
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,840
of people to do it and quite a few

103
00:04:13,158 --> 00:04:16,639
people have posted pictures and whatnot

104
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,879
but I I could probably do a video easy

105
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,680
enough I was kind of waiting to talk to

106
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:23,199
my friend cuz I was really hoping on

107
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,879
getting him to do it cuz he's the master

108
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,240
you know I could do it but he's the

109
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:28,918
master he knows the ratios of the

110
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,800
quality of resin that are required he

111
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:32,839
knows the temperature to meld them

112
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,960
together in the shapes and sizes that

113
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:36,799
are needed the thickness how to roll it

114
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:38,519
how to the whole nine yards right it's

115
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,400
lovely it's beautiful when the ash you

116
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:45,639
just hit it it just it's just so soft

117
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:49,399
it's like soft powder but

118
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:51,560
um you should do that yeah I I I will

119
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:53,319
one day it'll it'll it's a matter of

120
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,600
it's a matter of going back to uh the

121
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:57,719
cies and visiting my friend Ron and when

122
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,520
I'm visiting him uh I'm going to go

123
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,160

two birds one stuff it's a two for one

127
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:14,599
trip nowadays it's usually a four or

128
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:17,519
five for one trip it's good to be busy

129
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:19,680
yeah there's always a few dang that's

130

quite lovely yeah I'm really liking

131
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,600
these uh these pure hash joints it's a

132
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:26,159
nice thing to get back to that yes this

133
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,720
is perfect for me because I don't like

134
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,199
bugs really I'm not so much for I mean I

135
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,199
can deal I be enjoying the dabs of this

136
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:36,080
morning because they haven't killed me

137

you're inspiring me man yeah right on

139
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:43,439
yeah first time I ever saw those things

140
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,520
I just thought that's a great concept

141
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:46,918
come

142
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:51,639
on yeah it's definitely um you got to be

143
00:05:46,918 --> 00:05:54,439
very careful end super tasty yep 100%

144
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:57,600
wow that's so nice it's way taster than

145
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:59,038
um in any other format it's insane it's

146
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,319
because there's so much it's a gr of

147
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:02,918
hash we right now well sounds reasonable

148
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:05,520
let's do it I want to do that every day

149
00:06:02,918 --> 00:06:07,758
multiple times you can do it okay I know

150
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:10,038
I can I uh I did a video of just smoking

151
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,360
one of these to my own head and it's

152
00:06:10,038 --> 00:06:13,879
almost my most popular video there you

153

159
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:30,680
earlier that's what you need do that

160
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:33,000
pure giant house make let's see how big

161
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:35,560
we can get it we do them in steps figure

162
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,079

surrounded by beautiful strings and

170
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:56,280
talking about medicine that's it man

171
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:58,000
absolutely that's how the ideas flow I

172
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:59,959
want to try something I got this little

173
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,160

00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:18,919
CBC

181
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,720

185
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:31,759
yeah is two days wow craziness how time

186
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:31,758
flies it's f when you're

187
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,120
flying and I was thinking we should go

188
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:41,399
put the boat in the water yes great idea

189
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:44,240
I was lured with hash and boat ideas so

190
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:46,878
hash and boat ideas yeah I heard of that

191
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,240
the boat might happen the smoking on the

192
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:51,000
water I believe was the the O this is

193
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:54,000
cracking

194
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
uhoh

195
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:00,680
uhoh I do the two two finger like put

196
00:07:58,158 --> 00:08:02,879
your other finger on it hold it yeah so

197
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:06,000
it's more like if you use one finger

198
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:08,720
it'll just collapse I understand it

199
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,478
requires a technique it it

200
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,400
does it's uh the trick is really to try

201
00:08:11,478 --> 00:08:15,839
and leave the ash on the Cherry it seems

202
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:16,878
to cool the Cherry down I actually have

203
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:21,598
this phone

204
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:21,599
call while we're on the video

205
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,720

206
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,960
was serious there for a second I was

207
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,599
like I'm going to take this phone call

208
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:33,240

209

have time for The Joint

212
00:08:36,038 --> 00:08:39,240
either you know what the best thing

213
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:40,799
about the house joint is when it comes

214
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,000
apart we can still throw that in the

215
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:45,799
bong and smoke it boom and it's even

216
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,919
better no no good for the environment

217
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:48,439

everybody has their standards I think it

306
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,440

00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:51,359
it's the it's the

610
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:57,519
start full right in there this is uh

611
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:59,880
first bounce this morning which um of

612
00:28:57,519 --> 00:29:02,599
course I did a video on the other day

613
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,600
for my Sifty

614
00:29:02,798 --> 00:29:09,038
Sundays and I love giving away that hash

615
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:11,159
because as Sarah knows and as he's about

616
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:14,879
ready to explain that taste of the first

617
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:17,960
bounce woohoo to I love my dry SI

618
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:21,159
screens they're useful they're extremely

619
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:22,960
useful I really like that ceramic

620
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:24,360
insert that was a little bit different

621
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,038
from the one that sat on the top where

622
00:29:24,359 --> 00:29:27,359
before that one's actually inside now I

623
00:29:26,038 --> 00:29:28,839
like that yeah well you know what

624
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:30,199
happened was the other one sat on the

625
00:29:28,839 --> 00:29:32,319
top because do you notice how this is a

626
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,759
little taller right here yeah okay

627
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:35,678
because I was going to put a screen on

628
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:38,000
top of mine I asked them to shave this

629
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:41,679
down so it was even with this when they

630
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,839
shaved this down it made this fatter oh

631
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:45,840
and so this no longer went inside so

632
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:47,558
this won't fit in my other tie nail top

633
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:49,720
but it fits in the one that has not been

634
00:29:47,558 --> 00:29:52,678
shaved down that's

635
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:54,038
hilarious well Sarah um we're all going

636
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:56,399
to do a hit of medy here and then we're

637
00:29:54,038 --> 00:29:58,519
going to do all hit of uh each one so

638
00:29:56,398 --> 00:30:00,678
I'm allow Mark to dump that on there for

639
00:29:58,519 --> 00:30:02,319
thank you thank you all right there is a

640
00:30:00,679 --> 00:30:05,080
bit of a trick to it in the sense that

641
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:06,839
uh if you don't get it off if you put if

642
00:30:05,079 --> 00:30:08,359
you hold it over the tie nail for any

643
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:09,759
amount of time it melts to the skillet

644
00:30:08,359 --> 00:30:11,678
to I'm going to say it melts and then

645
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:12,839
you've got to scoop it off the titanium

646
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:15,399
and the whole trip is is that we're

647
00:30:12,839 --> 00:30:18,199
hitting it off the ceramic and it is a

648
00:30:15,398 --> 00:30:19,398
different tasting hit subtly but it's

649
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:22,159
still

650
00:30:19,398 --> 00:30:25,158
different one for you Jo super tasty in

651
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:27,200
here for that and going down the line I

652
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:29,200
clean the skillet tool as well thank you

653
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:31,480
very much I saw that we always talk

654
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:33,960
about scle clean your Skillet tool

655
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:35,360
before you pass you have seen in Jamaica

656
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:37,360
Tony opened up all these beautiful

657
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:39,879
hashes and I looked inside it was like

658
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:41,398
flow OG it was just all like like a

659
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:44,080
dirty Skillet tool got put in there like

660
00:30:41,398 --> 00:30:45,918
four or five times to perfect hash it's

661
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:48,960
it hurt my

662
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:51,278
soul we puffed it nonetheless of course

663
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,960
it it's just an OC it's an OCD thing you

664
00:30:51,278 --> 00:30:56,200
know the thing that I kind of laughed

665
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:58,720
about um is when you're like where's the

666
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:01,720
Bruce Banner it's all gone well this

667
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:03,519
same thing happened in Barcelona the

668
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:06,360
Bruce Banner when the Bruce Banner the

669
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:08,558
full Mountain I got one little hit that

670
00:31:06,359 --> 00:31:10,879
Tony saved me and then I I pressed it

671
00:31:08,558 --> 00:31:13,038
out and I put it on top of my denail and

672
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:15,600
it was there for days when I put it

673
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:19,000
pulled it off of the denail and put it

674
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:21,558
on like a the top of a a little

675
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,919
container Giddy Up came and and puffed

676
00:31:21,558 --> 00:31:25,918
like 80 to 90% of it which was like

677
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:27,639
totally legit that his nose found the

678
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:30,240
sweet piece and that he was but it was

679
00:31:27,638 --> 00:31:31,599
one I I just kept forgetting that like

680
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,759
when you're puffing with a big group of

681
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:36,278
people and everything's game they're

682
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:38,759
going to want the same thing that you

683
00:31:36,278 --> 00:31:40,240
want so it's like and but the funny

684
00:31:38,759 --> 00:31:41,879
thing was and I share all my stuff

685
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,558
evenly that was just something that Tony

686
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:46,440
said I saved this for you yes this I've

687
00:31:44,558 --> 00:31:48,918
been saving this for a year for you it's

688
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:51,120
one little hit I want you to have it and

689
00:31:48,919 --> 00:31:53,278
then I turn around and it's almost it's

690
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:56,719
almost all gone and when he said

691
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:58,960
it was funny I I remember when we were

692
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:01,679
um no it was actually

693
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:03,399
amdam and and uh the Bruce Banner

694
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:05,320
someone actually took it all and put it

695
00:32:03,398 --> 00:32:07,199
into a joint remember yeah that's why I

696
00:32:05,319 --> 00:32:09,960
laugh so hard because this had already

697
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:12,200
happened previously almost almost a year

698
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:14,240
ago with tobacco yeah and they mixed it

699
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:16,679
with tobacco too yeah that was even the

700
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:20,200
worst part about it oh my God the

701
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:22,360
kill all of it the [ __ ] no it was it was

702
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:25,159
like that's why when he said this I'm

703
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:28,319
not saying you can't say it but listen

704
00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:30,039
but funny thing was was Tony was was

705
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:31,558
upset he was like but then he was like

706
00:32:30,038 --> 00:32:32,720
oh I rolled it he's like where's that

707
00:32:31,558 --> 00:32:34,480
hash and he's like I rolled it into a

708
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,079
joint you rolled it into a joint well

709
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,120
let's puff it so then Tony took a hit of

710
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:40,278
it and it was full of tobacco so then he

711
00:32:38,119 --> 00:32:40,278
was

712
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:47,880
like the hell else smokes with tobac on

713
00:32:44,038 --> 00:32:50,599
there sure oh it was funny it it was um

714
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:53,679
one of those things that uh for me when

715
00:32:50,599 --> 00:32:55,038
you said it on your last trip in Jamaica

716
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:57,480
I personally I called G I was like what

717
00:32:55,038 --> 00:32:59,240
are you doing man I laughed out loud so

718
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:02,240
hard watching that video yesterday

719
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:05,599
because I know a story yeah it was the

720
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:08,599
second yeah I was just like o again

721
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:11,359
second time oo so that would be the

722
00:33:08,599 --> 00:33:13,278
Astra boy that was um I that one got a

723
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:15,638
kick I grew this this actually

724
00:33:13,278 --> 00:33:18,720
particular resin I grew at between the

725
00:33:15,638 --> 00:33:20,759
temperatures of 65 and 70° Fahrenheit

726
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,759
and I kept my humidities around 30% the

727
00:33:20,759 --> 00:33:23,879
whole time so it was kind of like m

728
00:33:22,759 --> 00:33:25,440
talked about growing at a lower

729
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:26,639
temperature to try after David Allen

730
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:29,159
told us that growing at a lower

731
00:33:26,638 --> 00:33:30,839
temperature would it was 100% David

732
00:33:29,159 --> 00:33:32,519
Allen mentioned it and I said I'll do it

733
00:33:30,839 --> 00:33:34,439
and and well even before that I said I

734
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:36,000
was very interested in it I never did

735
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:37,960
anything in the regards to it cuz I

736
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,638
don't have uh the air conditioning units

737
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:41,600
or anything I run a very simple system

738
00:33:39,638 --> 00:33:44,278
and summertime is not an option for me

739
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:47,119
but I'd love the idea of a cold room

740
00:33:44,278 --> 00:33:49,278
grow so um this is the cold room grow

741
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:52,719
experiment um what we're smoking yeah

742
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:54,960
nice it's an idea do it with the My

743
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:57,798
Little Pony dessert hash oh some dessert

744
00:33:54,960 --> 00:34:00,360
hash that Astro Boy too will give you

745
00:33:57,798 --> 00:34:02,119
almost an anxiet is high like that c99

746
00:34:00,359 --> 00:34:04,959
sort of some people hit it and they're

747
00:34:02,119 --> 00:34:06,879
just like okay so do you want to enjoy

748
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:09,358
that asra boy high and then hit them for

749
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:12,000
a couple minutes you know the longest

750
00:34:09,358 --> 00:34:13,598
time sit back we're in the shade now we

751
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,918
uh had if you noticed we Jerry rigged

752
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:19,519

753
00:34:16,918 --> 00:34:23,000
umbrella it's giving us it's giving us

754
00:34:19,519 --> 00:34:25,280
shade certain level of it we could give

755
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,159
uh give joh a little bit more shade

756
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:30,720
seems like he's coming no I don't think

757
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:33,280
I'm going to get the sun's pass that

758
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:35,000
point it's not too hot anyway yet this

759
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:38,040
at this point in time I just lean back I

760
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:40,480
get down here mhm chill oh we've got our

761
00:34:38,039 --> 00:34:43,320
ice water we've definitely had a nice

762
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:45,838
hashy day today is BC day and we did it

763
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:48,159
up I would first swim in the Pacific

764
00:34:45,838 --> 00:34:49,759
Ocean yes before yourent first time

765
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:52,480
before your acent first time in years

766
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:55,040
and the best part about it EXC about two

767
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:58,000
weeks ago I was swimming in the ocean in

768
00:34:55,039 --> 00:35:00,279
Jamaica you I was there with you I know

769
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,599
it's like twice in almost 30 days that's

770
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:05,079
like Wicked aw I don't know it's um Good

771
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:07,039
Vibes I've always had the urge to swim

772
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:08,560
in the ocean when it was near and it was

773
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:10,920
one of the reasons why I wanted to live

774
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:12,199
near the ocean absolutely I people don't

775
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:14,480
think about it too much but when you

776
00:35:12,199 --> 00:35:17,319
look at the ocean it's a freedom to get

777
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,880
you can go in that ocean on a boat and

778
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:20,680
literally go anywhere in the world if

779
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,760
you have the proper vessel that's

780
00:35:20,679 --> 00:35:24,799
basically that's what that why do we Ser

781
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:27,280
Road don't even do that why because it's

782
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,599
Freedom you can go anywhere that is a

783
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:32,000
great way looking at

784
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:33,280
terrifying sa out into the world well

785
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,480
considering what you said it was a good

786
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:40,240
day that we only had the speaker come

787
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:44,280
down didn't get towed there was

788
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:46,078
no you know wasn't too much money ripped

789
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:48,800
all the way to Horseshoe Bay oh my God

790
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:52,280
that was so fast that was great but

791
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:54,160
great great great so much fun yeah like

792
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:55,720
I'm all like super paying attention

793
00:35:54,159 --> 00:35:56,960
making sure there's no it's the ocean

794
00:35:55,719 --> 00:35:58,439
you know you guys out there that have

795
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,679
boats on lakes

796
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:03,280
it's not the same no it's not the same

797
00:36:00,679 --> 00:36:05,759
there's killer whales in

798
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,560
there well I didn't we didn't see any no

799
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,880
but they jumped saw eag though remember

800
00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:13,159
we see a bag and I saw a seal oh you did

801
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,720
I did yes oh ex I did see that seal too

802
00:36:13,159 --> 00:36:16,799
I was I felt bad actually cuz when we

803
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:18,759
were on Boer I probably could have just

804
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:21,960
gone around the island and showed you

805
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:25,160
guys uh baby seals out on the Rocks dang

806
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:28,119
well next time they're out

807
00:36:25,159 --> 00:36:32,039
there I found I like nature

808
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:34,280
it's like that's why I'm here so is that

809
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:35,960
why you're here I well I like you came

810
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:38,240
for a beautiful wedding for some friends

811
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:39,760
well I didn't I'm here for a multitude

812
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:43,239
of reasons but one of which is the

00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,318
anniversary or something like

835

that I'm a baby whenever he gives me big

840

841
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:50,838
back and then my next one's a more

842
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:52,599

00:38:12,519 --> 00:38:16,280
like sounds like a political person I

852
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:18,960
don't care is it an MLP I'm past the

853
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:21,160
point that's pretty close to MLB this is

854
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:24,119
good res Major League Baseball Major

00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:27,519
thinking that

857
00:38:29,559 --> 00:38:35,078
Ripper that pure dry sift to Will Rock

858
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,960
You with the full tur content right yeah

859
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:40,599
I know it's still

860
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:42,760
makes but it's a good cough like got

861
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:44,838
like kind of like dho like I feel like

862
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:47,720
I'm being suffocated cough yeah that's

863
00:38:44,838 --> 00:38:50,799
scary yeah this is more just like very

864
00:38:47,719 --> 00:38:52,879
expectorant it is for sure and I find

865
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,280
the more you cough you know I I'm not

866
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,960
really a big fan of that if you don't

867
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:57,680
cough you don't get off saying I don't

868
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:59,679
think that's true but I'll tell you the

869
00:38:57,679 --> 00:39:01,879
more you cough sometimes wow the more

870
00:38:59,679 --> 00:39:03,480
you do get off it is true was because um

871
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:05,480
you're choking yourself with oxygen you

872
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:06,960
can't breathe so of course you're going

873
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:08,039
to get a little to the brain you're

874
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,358
going to get a little bit of a buzz from

875
00:39:08,039 --> 00:39:12,800
it just

876
00:39:09,358 --> 00:39:15,239
saying yeah that's just my theory but

877
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:17,640
you know what Ian what's up Pooch oh

878

scratching me up oh oh

883
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:35,920
nice why you hurt me like that so I was

884
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:38,359
thinking I got I got I got um I got like

885
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:41,159
280 gram of fresh Frozen asra boy in the

886
00:39:38,358 --> 00:39:44,679
freezer yeah nice I got another like 70

887
00:39:41,159 --> 00:39:47,159
gram of uh nice dry popcorn nice I got

888
00:39:44,679 --> 00:39:48,759
another like qu pound of nice solid big

889
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:50,679
buds awesome and then I got another

890
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:52,880
about 70 80 grams of some smaller other

891
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:55,480
popcorn so I want to run a test I want

892
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:58,760
to take 70 gram crush it crust get all

893
00:39:55,480 --> 00:40:01,358
this get let's clean it run the 70 grams

894
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:04,400
of fresh Frozen clean it or run it like

895
00:40:01,358 --> 00:40:06,480
a a single bounce we'll do uh clean it

896
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:09,240
crush it down completely see how much

897
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:11,679
resin we get from 70 gr of dry and then

898
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:14,118
two how much grams we get from 280 gam

899
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:16,598
of fresh okay there you go cuz then it

900
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:18,838
gives us a ratio the ratio should be

901
00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:22,800
accurate if you dry yeah you can also do

902
00:40:18,838 --> 00:40:25,279
it this way dry the material that you

903
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:27,318
use fresh afterwards and you'll get the

904
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:29,800
dry weight of that herb so we'll do that

905
00:40:27,318 --> 00:40:31,880
so it'll tell you the cuz this people

906
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:33,760
are always so confused like they like

907
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:35,160
dry yields way better well it's like

908
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,280
well dude of course it does it's a

909
00:40:35,159 --> 00:40:39,199
higher ratio of plant matter that's just

910
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,519
common sense dry yields way better

911
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:43,519
course it would be it doesn't yield any

912
00:40:40,519 --> 00:40:45,880
different it yields the same yield the

913
00:40:43,519 --> 00:40:48,800
Yi's not going to change it course

914
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:50,318
obviously yeah oh my go for me I'm not

915
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,880
looking at the actually the I'm not

916
00:40:50,318 --> 00:40:54,039
looking at the yield that I'm curious

917
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:56,559
about I'm more I'm more curious I'm more

918
00:40:54,039 --> 00:40:58,838
Curious on get no no not the ratio

919
00:40:56,559 --> 00:41:02,199
either curious on

920
00:40:58,838 --> 00:41:05,000
the let's let's just take this whole a

921
00:41:02,199 --> 00:41:06,078
lack of Tes in the dry obviously I mean

922
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,079
that you won't have to be curious about

923
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:10,599
it it's a fact of science dry material

924
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:15,280
or have less Tarin than fresh material

925
00:41:10,599 --> 00:41:17,400
100% however dry um triome membranes are

926
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:20,440
easier to dry with water hash and in a

927
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:22,160
sense in my opinion give like a nicer

928
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:24,159
fresh Frozen's awesome for a short

929
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:25,960
period yeah but then it Butters out hard

930
00:41:24,159 --> 00:41:28,239
and it's like it's just so hard to dry

931
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:30,240
that stuff properly it can be done but

932
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:31,838
here in the Northwest Pacific Northwest

933
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:33,439
we should mention really that's where we

934
00:41:31,838 --> 00:41:34,759
are thanks for the kick there yeah I was

935
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:38,159
like he's doing a little freak Now give

936
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:41,040
me a kick um the humidity is high here

937
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:43,279
it's like really high so you maybe even

938
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:46,480
getting room that's more controlled so

939
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:48,079
high it Butters out Matt's dryp I know

940
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:49,519
like come on all the time look this is

941
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:51,880
it right here let's smoke some of that

942
00:41:49,519 --> 00:41:54,039
there Matt's dryp look at it's buttered

943
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:55,519
it should be just powdered out stuff

944
00:41:54,039 --> 00:41:57,519
nice he even said that he's like check

945
00:41:55,519 --> 00:42:00,239
this out so it takes the argument out of

946
00:41:57,519 --> 00:42:03,000
the white out sort of all water hash is

947
00:42:00,239 --> 00:42:05,318
wet yeah it's hard you know Jen do on

948
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:08,400
Facebook she's mentioning her theory is

949
00:42:05,318 --> 00:42:10,079
is that it's natural plant acids I don't

950
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,639
know if it's natural plant acids if it's

951
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:14,160
tpin there's all sorts of different

952
00:42:11,639 --> 00:42:15,480
solvents in the resin itself thanks Matt

953
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:17,639
it could be breaking down the wax

954
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:19,838
membrane but it seems to have something

955
00:42:17,639 --> 00:42:23,719
to do with

956
00:42:19,838 --> 00:42:27,358
moisture I believe what do I know though

957
00:42:23,719 --> 00:42:29,598
so I'm well baked here and I'm actually

958
00:42:27,358 --> 00:42:33,239
you know I just did a rip of that

959
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:39,240
um was that the Barb or the

960
00:42:33,239 --> 00:42:39,239
off Barb uh Barb or blue blue uh

961
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:45,519
blue blue Blue's Barb too I have no idea

962
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:46,640

964
00:42:46,639 --> 00:42:50,639
more because I just I just I just had

965
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:53,400
this one Barb you must have been puffing

966
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:55,358
Barb with uh Matt and um I believe there

967
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:58,119
was some Barb I believe there was some

968
00:42:55,358 --> 00:42:59,880
Barb and some CBD Renee and some there

969
00:42:58,119 --> 00:43:01,800

parents brought you here it's a little

1014
00:44:32,318 --> 00:44:35,599
harder when you just go by yourself I

1015
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:37,400
thought I came when I was three man like

1016
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:40,119
you know what I hitchhiked into BC when

00:44:46,039 --> 00:44:50,000

1023
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,800

1024
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:56,440
something I did Jasper and I did Lake

1025
00:44:53,800 --> 00:45:00,200

1026
00:44:56,440 --> 00:45:01,800
to vanc couver it was very fun my last

1027
00:45:00,199 --> 00:45:03,679
ride dropped me off and I thought they

1028
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:05,440
were pretty cool people but I left my

1029
00:45:03,679 --> 00:45:08,000
backpack in there with all my like these

1030
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:10,079
clothes I bought in Central America and

1031
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,280
like a CD player with like a you know

1032
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:14,760
like a a bunch of good CDs and I never

1033
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:16,760
they never came back they were the ones

1034
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:19,839
that dropped me off they knew the house

1035
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:22,319
damn yeah it was a bummer it was what it

1036
00:45:19,838 --> 00:45:24,639
was you know it happens I got pulled

1037
00:45:22,318 --> 00:45:27,719
over in that same van in the interior in

1038
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:32,118
B and we're like way up in this mountain

1039
00:45:27,719 --> 00:45:34,959
town and his whole dashboard is full of

1040
00:45:32,119 --> 00:45:36,559
what did he have he had like sugar cubes

1041
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:38,760
wrapped in tin foil or something and

1042
00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:40,200
each one had two hits of LSD in them

1043
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:42,440
then he had a giant ashtray on the

1044
00:45:40,199 --> 00:45:45,318
dogghouse just full of roaches and we

1045
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:50,400
got pulled over me driving by the RCMP

1046
00:45:45,318 --> 00:45:53,558
oh and and it wasn't insured the vehicle

1047
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:56,079
wasn't God so think of this how is this

1048
00:45:53,559 --> 00:45:58,000
possible in any way shape of that you

1049
00:45:56,079 --> 00:45:59,880
could get away

1050
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,199
from that situation could you imagine

1051
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:03,160
how impossible that would be it be

1052
00:46:01,199 --> 00:46:06,399
pretty hard so this is what happened

1053
00:46:03,159 --> 00:46:09,920
okay he doesn't see the LSD he seemingly

1054
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:13,720
ignores the joints yeah he doesn't ask

1055
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:15,800
to search the van who he tells us that

1056
00:46:13,719 --> 00:46:18,078
if we make a promise to just pull up the

1057
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:20,880
street a bit here he'll take us to a

1058
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:22,680
park and just sleep in the van overnight

1059
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,760
and then walk down the hill and right at

1060
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:25,480
the bottom of the hill there's an

1061
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:28,400
insurance place and buy insurance for

1062
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:30,480
the van that if we did that he he'd be

1063
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:32,720

the Jamaican field the blueberry I know

1181
00:51:05,318 --> 00:51:09,159
skunk so this is the orange Hill

1182
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:13,039
blueberry skunk from the field that John

1183
00:51:09,159 --> 00:51:14,639
and I were in I saved one seed actually

1184
00:51:13,039 --> 00:51:15,960
this wasn't from the field we were in

1185
00:51:14,639 --> 00:51:19,440
this one was

1186
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:22,519
from um the nicest Bud we saw at inad

1187
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:24,000
yard while we were in Kingston and

1188
00:51:22,519 --> 00:51:25,838

00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:32,318
while we were there the whole time so

1192
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:34,000
this is that nice so I'm definitely

1193
00:51:32,318 --> 00:51:35,880
going to get a cutting of

1194
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,679
this I don't know I think this is the

1195
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:39,680
one you said didn't have much of a smell

1196
00:51:37,679 --> 00:51:40,960
yeah it doesn't have much G it's kind of

1197
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:43,558
like

1198
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:46,199
tomatoey average Stander smell the the

1199
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:50,720
other Jamaican that I have has a really

1200
00:51:46,199 --> 00:51:53,919
nice stock smell I it's deep it's piny

1201
00:51:50,719 --> 00:51:55,838
yeah really piny as well the uh sweet

1202
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:57,240
skunk and the congales which is right

1203
00:51:55,838 --> 00:51:58,639
behind you

1204
00:51:57,239 --> 00:52:00,078
and I don't know you just moved away

1205
00:51:58,639 --> 00:52:01,519
from that and after you put that plant

1206
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:02,720
over there and rubbing it it smells

1207
00:52:01,519 --> 00:52:05,079
really nice

1208
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:08,159
right M what about that one what's that

1209
00:52:05,079 --> 00:52:11,079
barb or Afghan I think that's

1210
00:52:08,159 --> 00:52:12,279
Afghan from the great Gardener it's

1211
00:52:11,079 --> 00:52:14,480

interesting genetics I uh I'll be

1213
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:18,719
interested to see what comes of this

1214
00:52:16,639 --> 00:52:21,759
particular strain that lived its life in

1215
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:25,480
Jamaica and is now here it's an

1216
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:27,680

1222
00:52:37,639 --> 00:52:41,118
and he just like tied it up with a rope

1223
00:52:39,559 --> 00:52:43,480

row of uh sweet peppers that we're

1232
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:03,160
growing and we planted the sunflowers

1233
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:05,960

cell going we have an

1235
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:12,280
avocado yeah just a potato that needs

1236
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:12,280
watering desperately up in the

1237
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:17,159

some water it needs some water it's a

00:53:17,159 --> 00:53:20,960
potato though it'll have water to feed

1240
00:53:19,079 --> 00:53:22,240
those leaves for so much longer than

1241

most of these those leaves are all

1242
00:53:22,239 --> 00:53:27,318
coming out of the potato yes they're

1243
00:53:24,358 --> 00:53:28,759
good solid greens yes quite nice but I

1244
00:53:27,318 --> 00:53:31,838
imagine that would impact your potato

1245
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:35,359
production uh it big

1246

smoke and that's why you're watching I

1553
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:38,760
bet you most of the people watching

1554
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:41,318
right now are smoking something of some

1555
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:43,079
sort while we're puffing cuz it would be

1556
01:06:41,318 --> 01:06:44,480
weird just to watch us puff you got to

1557
01:06:43,079 --> 01:06:45,920
puff with us yeah if they're not they

1558
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:47,679
should be if you don't have anything to

1559
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:50,400
Puff then it's not weird you can just be

1560
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:52,960
like inspired and realize that you two

1561
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:55,798
can puff the best that there is by

1562
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:57,838
simply making different choices yes like

1563
01:06:55,798 --> 01:07:00,559
I'm going to grow this and I'm going to

1564
01:06:57,838 --> 01:07:01,880
extract this with care and attention

1565
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:03,400
with care and attention then again if

1566
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:05,519
you don't decide to do those things I

1567
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:09,039
have a funny feeling that enough people

1568
01:07:05,519 --> 01:07:11,639
are going to in invest their time in the

1569
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:14,640
near future to get it done so that

1570
01:07:11,639 --> 01:07:17,519
people on all levels have access to it

1571
01:07:14,639 --> 01:07:19,759
whether you grow and and isolate and

1572
01:07:17,519 --> 01:07:24,440

1723
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:37,400
like Colorado left California in the

1724
01:13:34,639 --> 01:13:39,560
dust and California forever was the most

1725
01:13:37,399 --> 01:13:42,119
Progressive the most on point the most

1726
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:44,080
like I I don't know get the vote they

1727
01:13:42,119 --> 01:13:46,880
didn't get the vote gone through at

1728
01:13:44,079 --> 01:13:50,559
least once maybe tce just seemed insane

1729
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:50,560
like how did California not get the

1730
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:55,719
vote too Stone to go in and vote they

1731
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:57,520

1732
01:13:55,719 --> 01:14:02,119

1735
01:14:06,079 --> 01:14:11,880
right yeah it is on a different level

1736
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:14,359
too though they all have different state

1737
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:15,960
rules so I think it needs to be flipped

1738
01:14:14,359 --> 01:14:18,279
to Federal cuz you have right now

1739
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:19,800
families with epileptic children who are

1740
01:14:18,279 --> 01:14:21,359
like I live in Utah I can't get the

1741
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:23,440
medicine that will stop my child from

1742
01:14:21,359 --> 01:14:27,000
having seizures every day which is like

1743
01:14:23,439 --> 01:14:28,719
canis cids the from the Cannabis and so

1744
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:30,479
they move they drive to states where

1745
01:14:28,719 --> 01:14:32,079
they're allowed to have it and it's like

1746
01:14:30,479 --> 01:14:33,919
that's insane what kind of country is

1747
01:14:32,079 --> 01:14:35,559
that making [ __ ] people move over to

1748
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:38,480
another state the whole I mean the

1749
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:40,120
recreational use I mean I can see people

1750
01:14:38,479 --> 01:14:42,439
debating it yeah no problem debate it

1751
01:14:40,119 --> 01:14:44,279
all day long here here's the thing the

1752
01:14:42,439 --> 01:14:46,039

1754
01:14:46,039 --> 01:14:49,719
everyone's like it's the most medicinal

1755
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:51,480
thing it's so medicinal you can actually

1756
01:14:49,719 --> 01:14:56,158
take it just for its euphoric After

1757
01:14:51,479 --> 01:14:57,759

they on it's all just crazy it's like

1766
01:15:14,119 --> 01:15:17,800
man like from up from up here I think

1767
01:15:16,319 --> 01:15:19,599
like it's the land of the free it's

1768
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:21,079
America it's like we're fighting for the

1769
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:23,639
so it's like how do you do that to your

1770
01:15:21,079 --> 01:15:25,800
people how long has Vancouver has beenal

1771
01:15:23,639 --> 01:15:28,159
here like forever um it's not you know

1772
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:30,119
it's just decriminalized in a way that

1773
01:15:28,158 --> 01:15:33,719
we have Federal licensing so you can get

1774
01:15:30,119 --> 01:15:35,198
a license here federally but it's like

1775
01:15:33,719 --> 01:15:37,000
it's a special license that you go and

1776
01:15:35,198 --> 01:15:39,039
get from your doctor it's not just legal

1777
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:42,439
it's not legal regation

1778
01:15:39,039 --> 01:15:44,399
here accepted totally accepted vapor

1779
01:15:42,439 --> 01:15:46,839
bars

1780
01:15:44,399 --> 01:15:49,079
dispensaries so so if you go into those

1781
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:51,199
those stores or place you have to have a

1782
01:15:49,079 --> 01:15:55,559
card yeah they be but they'll give you a

1783
01:15:51,198 --> 01:15:56,279
card pretty darn fast $ see a

1784
01:15:55,560 --> 01:15:58,960
they

1785
01:15:56,279 --> 01:16:01,279
gots oh yeah it's not too much different

1786
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:04,198
from the California model I think it's a

1787
01:16:01,279 --> 01:16:05,639
model that is okay for beginners and

1788
01:16:04,198 --> 01:16:08,039
eventually once we get into something

1789
01:16:05,639 --> 01:16:09,920
more established you know maybe let that

1790
01:16:08,039 --> 01:16:12,198
small amount be the grandfather din or

1791
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:15,239
something cuz you always need like We'll

1792
01:16:12,198 --> 01:16:18,079
always need dispensaries and Vapor

1793
01:16:15,238 --> 01:16:20,678
Lounge type bars regardless if cannabis

1794
01:16:18,079 --> 01:16:23,559
goes to a more pharmaceutical 10 years

1795
01:16:20,679 --> 01:16:26,079
will be eating material store in every

1796
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:27,600
corner it's about end canabo system and

1797
01:16:26,079 --> 01:16:30,039
feeding the bodies of

1798
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:31,440
TAC that's pretty heavy it sounds insane

1799
01:16:30,039 --> 01:16:33,639
but if you learn that you have an endoc

1800
01:16:31,439 --> 01:16:35,319
canabo system and that every cell in

1801
01:16:33,639 --> 01:16:37,119
your body has receptors for these

1802
01:16:35,319 --> 01:16:38,880
particular type of canono which are

1803
01:16:37,119 --> 01:16:40,719
produced androgynously in your body are

1804
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:42,679
called endoc canabo and how they're

1805
01:16:40,719 --> 01:16:45,480
produced they they use the building

1806
01:16:42,679 --> 01:16:47,880
blocks of Omega-3s and Omega 6s

1807
