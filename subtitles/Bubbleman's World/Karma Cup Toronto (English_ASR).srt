207
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:02,509
cuffs I'm honest with the painting

208
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:09,350
so looks good so it was a total

209
00:10:06,929 --> 00:10:12,149
last-minute thing and we didn't have any

210
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:16,460
firsts left right

211
00:10:12,149 --> 00:10:19,649
so we had we had you just clean that

212
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:21,180
five-minute run right and the seconds

213
00:10:19,649 --> 00:10:23,490
was there we had the D mail there were

214
00:10:21,179 --> 00:10:26,250
like oh let's test everything and the

215
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:28,680
seconds of that run was still super

216
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:30,028
melty while it was still super baldie so

217
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:32,429
we were like yeah well that's already

218
00:10:30,028 --> 00:10:34,889
here let's enter the seconds let's see

219
00:10:32,429 --> 00:10:39,509
on the second the seconds of the of the

220
00:10:34,889 --> 00:10:41,399
process does and voila we sort of get

221
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:43,379
second place with that awesome well

222
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:47,669
second place is no slouch for the second

223
00:10:43,379 --> 00:10:49,429
pass of Dreyse if it wasn't the first

224
00:10:47,669 --> 00:10:52,139
but it was the seconds and go figure

225
00:10:49,429 --> 00:10:53,278
Matt took home the second second-place

226
00:10:52,139 --> 00:10:54,600
couple I'll be looking forward to

227
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:56,129
hitting that when we get back home I'll

228
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,750
come by and have a have a session with

229
00:10:56,129 --> 00:10:59,370
the end of that pipe one day it was

230
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:01,379
fantastic and a great event again I

231
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:04,259
can't say enough about the Carbon Copy

232
00:11:01,379 --> 00:11:07,080
I had a fantastic time and I look

233
00:11:04,259 --> 00:11:10,259
forward to next year karma come to or

234
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:11,910
yeah I think you know what the only my

235
00:11:10,259 --> 00:11:13,439
only complaint and this this is the same

236
00:11:11,909 --> 00:11:15,000
complaint that you get every where we

237
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,550
have the same problem at our legends of

238
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,830
hash party every year the sheer velocity

239
00:11:17,549 --> 00:11:22,349
and amount of smoke that just fills the

240
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:24,420
air and moves around and it just becomes

241
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:25,528
I mean at Legends it's a little

242
00:11:24,419 --> 00:11:27,479
different because there's no paper no

243
00:11:25,528 --> 00:11:29,220
glue and no plant matter in the air but

244
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,509
it doesn't matter once you get a certain

245
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:32,990
amount of smoke in the air you're no

246
00:11:30,509 --> 00:11:35,759
longer getting oxygen and it just slowly

247
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:37,769
it the hardest of the hard core is I've

248
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:39,870
seen walk outside and just be like I'm

249
00:11:37,769 --> 00:11:41,789
just gonna have a little bit

250
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:43,350
I saw the same thing last night I think

251
00:11:41,789 --> 00:11:45,689
next year good next year at the karma

252
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:48,180
cup i I definitely will only say that it

253
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:49,770
same with legends little ventilation fan

254
00:11:48,179 --> 00:11:51,449
go a long way

255
00:11:49,769 --> 00:11:53,309
tiny little ventilate like a hyper fan

256
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:55,379
sure but I was thinking of how many

257
00:11:53,309 --> 00:11:57,958
growers were in the room with Matt there

258
00:11:55,379 --> 00:11:59,338
and Thaddeus med men and Sarah Sunday

259
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:00,659
and all these other people that I

260
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:03,089
recognize I'm thinking man there's like

261
00:12:00,659 --> 00:12:04,679
50 growers in the room right now and we

262
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:08,190
don't have any ventilation in this room

263
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:09,719
but other than that killer event

264
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:12,150
definitely will come back next year

265
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:14,820
really great I mean Sarah Sunday

266
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:17,370
collected so many prizes to give away at

267
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:20,430
that event I honestly believe she had

268
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:22,830
almost a prize for each person that was

269
00:12:20,429 --> 00:12:25,169
their books and lights and

270
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:26,790
and bubble mouths I mean literally that

271
00:12:25,169 --> 00:12:29,939
was enough I ended up putting a little

272
00:12:26,789 --> 00:12:32,990
package of papers lighters sticker and

273
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:39,510
then I put a jar of the barb

274
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:41,759
seventy-three micron here you go man yes

275
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:45,000
man what ideas goes out picks it up

276
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:47,700
we're all just like how ironic is sort

277
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,200
of bad bad winds winds the sample I

278
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,850
throw it I think there's like I don't

279
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,890
know how many people were in there 50

280
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:54,600
undred oh that's hilarious it was

281
00:12:52,889 --> 00:12:56,279
hilarious good moment I liked it was

282
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,350
great it was Karma

283
00:12:56,279 --> 00:13:00,629
so left over on the day today I'm gonna

284
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:02,759
try and go do a hash Church over at

285
00:13:00,629 --> 00:13:04,110
vapor central I'm hoping that that's

286
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:05,549
gonna happen even if it's only for an

287
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:07,850
hour I really want to make it happen but

288
00:13:05,549 --> 00:13:09,929
I do fly did you make it today yeah and

289
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:10,889
you know that nervous feeling of

290
00:13:09,929 --> 00:13:13,259
whenever you're flying to another

291
00:13:10,889 --> 00:13:14,850
country I'd like to be organized and

292
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:16,830
prepared it'll be a weird thing to go do

293
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:18,659
a hash Church for two hours and then do

294
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:20,400
a minutes was gonna run into the air go
