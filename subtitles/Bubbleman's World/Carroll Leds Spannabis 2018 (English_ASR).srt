4
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:31,469

biggest font supporters right here

12
00:00:45,969 --> 00:00:50,289
[ __ ] awesome guys saved our ass in

13
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:52,689
the blue river party a couple of years

14
00:00:50,289 --> 00:00:53,719
ago I was talking today I got your back

15
00:00:52,689 --> 00:00:55,250
bubble man up on a year

16
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:58,119
biggest supporter so I thought maybe you

17
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:58,119
could take us on camera

18
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:04,378
put them up to the show hey it's no

19
00:01:03,009 --> 00:01:06,179
secret man

20
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:07,240
people like to hide their past I don't

21
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,720
play

22
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:15,489
I was a dealer back in the day for many

23
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:17,620
in the Midwest okay and I acquired a lot

24
00:01:15,489 --> 00:01:20,619
of rare genetics but they were all

25
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:23,760
coming from humble so when these

26
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:23,760
genetics would appear

27
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,480
it wouldn't happen if it was snow

28
00:01:29,049 --> 00:01:33,939
only one seeds okay now I'll never

29
00:01:31,569 --> 00:01:37,089
forget that when that seed popped out of

30
00:01:33,939 --> 00:01:39,879
that last bud pretty much that was

31
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:40,930
buddy Richie was with me this is no [ __ ]

32
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:44,769
he

33
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:47,480
and I was spoken all certain pop

34
00:01:44,769 --> 00:01:50,329
exploded smoke just like a plane going

35
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:53,109
down my skis I thought I was seeing

36
00:01:50,329 --> 00:01:53,109
things when the seed

37
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:59,310
crash what happened then is that

38
00:01:57,269 --> 00:02:01,408
basically started trying to preserve

39
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:04,909
genetics

40
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:04,909
right and that

41
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:07,969
as we talked to a pest trying to read to

42
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,460
do

43
00:02:07,969 --> 00:02:13,560
that lying into the jungle it's been

44
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:15,129
danger added apart we headed in

45
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,780
captivity

46
00:02:15,129 --> 00:02:21,449
we've been working with the Spain now

47
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:21,449
for close to eight years okay so

48
00:02:24,449 --> 00:02:28,659
some of the originals that were there

49
00:02:26,889 --> 00:02:31,180
right

50
00:02:28,659 --> 00:02:34,680
some of the

51
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:38,540
nice sativas that were coming along

52
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,540
that was what I favorite

53
00:02:39,189 --> 00:02:42,300
the special treat

54
00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:51,098
but you could see the super orange haze

55
00:02:45,789 --> 00:02:53,769
it has that crystally profile it has

56
00:02:51,098 --> 00:02:56,949
that nice aroma in the color of course

57
00:02:53,769 --> 00:03:01,120
you know that vibrant orange no these

58
00:02:56,949 --> 00:03:03,488
are LEDs okay all these bugs grown by

59
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:10,500
the LEDs today are proof you know that

60
00:03:03,489 --> 00:03:10,500
no you know I never tire of it brings

61
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,039
back memories that's beautiful so we can

62
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:18,700
use that again that right there's the

63
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:21,669
super orange haze super orange we

64
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:26,858
actually won awards with that I've won

65
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:29,649
three demos I was in Barcelona in 2016

66
00:03:26,859 --> 00:03:31,900
with the first rosin competition ever

67
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:34,689
and again went first with that that was

68
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:37,219
with the super orange haze later in time

69
00:03:34,689 --> 00:03:41,259
there was the blueberry haze

70
00:03:37,219 --> 00:03:41,259
and then also as well

71
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:50,530
terr p bud profile almost kind of a

72
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:52,990
cheese mix I would I would kind of call

73
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:56,060
it and you can kind of see the blue hues

74
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:58,909
and really

75
00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:03,920
taste that profile when you are smoking

76
00:03:58,909 --> 00:04:06,229
it either rosin vaping it rosin are also

77
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:07,609
just you know old-fashioned bong hit

78
00:04:06,229 --> 00:04:10,609
as I am

79
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:13,330
very famous for my bong hits but I loved

80
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:15,470
smoking with that dog I love really

81
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:16,430
having something that's unique that's

82
00:04:15,469 --> 00:04:22,129
different

83
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:23,780
no there was cultivar that came along

84
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:27,350
I preserved it along with silver

85
00:04:23,779 --> 00:04:29,449
colloidal spray you know using my fence

86
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:32,780
but I'm a strong believer in regular

87
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:34,639
seeds as well okay so my clone you know

88
00:04:32,779 --> 00:04:36,349
I do the feminized seeds I do the

89
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,659
regular seeds I believe that really you

90
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:41,270
need to maintain everything okay don't

91
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:44,090
give up okay so basically this is a

92
00:04:41,269 --> 00:04:47,899
incredible strain and then I call it

93
00:04:44,089 --> 00:04:51,060
greasy and the reason is that that

94
00:04:47,899 --> 00:04:53,429
greasy profile that comes

95
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:55,829
when you're making hash really what we

96
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:58,500
want we're hashed farmers aren't we I am

97
00:04:55,829 --> 00:05:00,089
Trang coalminers yes right well that's

98
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,189
what we want and when you smell that you

99
00:05:00,089 --> 00:05:04,139
smell those chirps that comes off in

100
00:05:02,189 --> 00:05:06,029
that rosin that would have been in the

101
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:08,099
competition this year I wasn't able to

102
00:05:06,029 --> 00:05:11,579
flood off so good thanks men

103
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:15,930
but we will be up next year with that

104
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:19,019
greasy stream but it's a wonderful 1980s

105
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:21,060
treat it's been kept apart but you know

106
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:25,229
you guys I appreciate you and I support

107
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:26,910
Paul van 100% this guy is legend

108
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:30,270
you know as I've always said in a

109
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:35,990
repeated winners come and go

110
00:05:30,269 --> 00:05:35,990
legends are forever bubbleman is allege

111
00:05:38,978 --> 00:05:43,779

yep I'm gonna get you in they believe

113
00:05:43,779 --> 00:05:48,329
they hear that people need to know that

114
00:05:45,459 --> 00:05:48,329
