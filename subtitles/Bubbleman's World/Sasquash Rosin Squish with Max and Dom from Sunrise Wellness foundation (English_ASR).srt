00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,160
am here with dom and Max from the

4
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:30,960
sunrise Wellness Foundation welcome guys

6
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,759
as you can remember from the last puff

7
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:38,000
Wednesday part two the sunrise Wellness

8
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:39,878
Foundation episode um Johnny and I went

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,439
and we purchased uh a bunch of different

10
00:00:39,878 --> 00:00:44,920
flow flavors to squish for our personal

11
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:46,238
head and these guys were like hey we

12
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,280
have some stuff that we would also like

13
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:50,799
squished so they gave me a jar of uh the

14
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:53,760
Teflon and they gave me about 36 gram of

15
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:56,238
the o09 cookies uh and because I was

16
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:59,000
playing around with um the materials

17
00:00:56,238 --> 00:01:01,119
that I had purchased from them which was

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,519
um Platinum girl cookies crossed with

19
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:08,319
WiFi 43 and Teflon those were the two I

20
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:11,080
had then Johnny B had the o09 cookies

21
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:12,639
and gorilla Cooks that's right so we

22
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:13,759
pressed all of that had a great time

23
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,560
learned a lot about the different

24
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:18,438
temperatures cuz I don't put press a lot

25
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:21,079
of flour I press mostly hash bubble hash

26
00:01:18,438 --> 00:01:23,000
dry sift finger rub for that matter but

27
00:01:21,078 --> 00:01:25,559
not a lot of flour little bit of a

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,239
learning curve came out uh pretty high

29
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,960
temperature 240° was pressing for about

30
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:32,879
15 to 20 seconds and getting a really

31
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:34,280
really stable shaty uh rosin that still

32
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:36,478
had a wonderful taste didn't have any

33
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:38,000
burnt popcorn flavor to it a lot of

34
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:40,078
people were like stressing on me and

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,959
saying I was pressing too hot people

36
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:45,359
throwing around numbers like

37
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:47,158
180° 200° 210 so I started experimenting

38
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:49,040
with those with a little bit of flour

39
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:50,759
that I had and immediately came to the

40
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,640
conclusion obviously that I'm sure a lot

41
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:54,560
of you have already come to that a low

42
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,280
temperature longer press is going to

43
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:00,759
produce a buttery rosin compared to a

44
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,799
shorter press with a much warmer

45
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:05,200
temperature you get this more consistent

46
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,840
sort of pull and snap or even a shatter

47
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,800
uh type end product so I didn't want to

48
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,280
press the material without them because

49
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,000
it's really kind of a personal choice

50
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,120
that you need to make how you want your

51
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
rosin to come out both of them were

52
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,640
producing the same yields I was getting

53
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,439
20 plus% from the rosin whether it was

54
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:23,559
butter or whether it was shatter so I

55
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:26,519
think we're going to do a variety of

56
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:28,360
things today um Dom and Max have uh

57
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:30,480
already processed and gotten the the

58
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:33,040
plant matter uh you know broken up

59
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:35,518
properly which we we contacted Phil soil

60
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:37,280
grown uh and I asked him hey what's the

61
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,800
best way to process flour he told us you

62
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,479
know fill the pouches about half fill um

63
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:45,080
leave the nugs in full you know leave

64
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:47,560
them basically as nugs but break them up

65
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:49,200
for the first few that you put in so

66
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,840
that the corners of the screen are

67
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:53,199
filled up which I thought you guys both

68
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,719
knew that tip when I mentioned it to you

69
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:56,958
I think that's a really great tip and if

70
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:59,239
you want to know a really great tip that

71
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,800
is one because the oil will pull into

72
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:02,878
those corners and you'll lose a

73
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,280
substantial amount in the screen and I

74
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:07,318
think it's why people don't like to use

75
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:10,039
screens and why they say hey I'm losing

76
00:03:07,318 --> 00:03:11,479
oil so we're going to do a variety of

77
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:13,199
things today we've already done a little

78
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:16,079
press we pressed my last butt of the

79
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:18,679
Teflon and actually can I offer you guys

80
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,360
a dab I love a dab a Teflon right do you

81
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:24,000
want to maybe prepare a few there and

82
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,680
I'll get the pipe over here and I'm

83
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,639
actually uh going to put a little bit of

84
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,480
water in the

85
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:32,759
bubbler I think I think so I will be

86
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:32,759
right

87
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,438
back oh yeah that's proper yeah this

88
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,000
stuff looks really

89
00:03:44,438 --> 00:03:49,680
good right and yeah we pressed this

90
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,199
stuff um what was the temperature 220 or

91
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:56,079
230 220 220 so this uh Teflon Bud was

92
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:57,639
processed or processed pressed extracted

93
00:03:56,079 --> 00:04:02,360
at

94
00:03:57,639 --> 00:04:04,878
220° I'd say it was under a minute like

95
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:06,200
yeah so we didn't time it we were just

96
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:08,199
kind of doing it Loose we wanted to have

97
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:12,078
some nice dabs for the uh for the rosin

98
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:15,479
vide so why don't we pull yourself off

99
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:18,280
one get it ready on the Dabber there Max

100
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:20,599
and uh oh yeah let's use the little root

101
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:22,078
Sciences root Sciences hooked me up with

102
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,720
a little dab mat the other day and it's

103
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:27,478
funny I have so many different oil

104
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,400
slick of dab mats different kinds that

105
00:04:27,478 --> 00:04:31,319
just seeing another different one like a

106
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:34,239
c circular one that's just fits the pipe

107
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:38,439
so perfect is uh appealing to

108
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:41,160
me let me make sure you have uh one more

109
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:44,719
exactly can't leave you hanging and give

110
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:46,880
you a carb cap less rip it's just not

111
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,880
the

112
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:53,519
same friends don't let friends dab

113
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:55,680
without carb caps unless well unless you

114
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:59,719
absolutely don't have one but then we

115
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:01,240
mver that [ __ ] there you go Bud find way

116
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,080
so pretty excited to get squishing on

117
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,439
this flower I'm not going to lie we've

118
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:06,000
uh we're going to film it of a nice you

119
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:08,439
know we're going to show you the full

120
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,120
preparation of you know putting it in

121
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:12,600
squishing it out opening it and

122
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:14,038
collecting all of the rosin and uh after

123
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:17,680
that because we have so many packs here

124
00:05:14,038 --> 00:05:19,159
there's about 10 here um or 11 even uh

125
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,439
we're going to just really show you the

126
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,919
Quick Clip of each one getting pressed

127
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:26,000
and the squish that we got out of each

128
00:05:22,918 --> 00:05:29,120
one did we weigh each one yeah we did

129
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,918
they're all weighed to 6.9 to 7.1 G okay

130
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,680
so uh this was another thing that we

131
00:05:30,918 --> 00:05:35,719
talked to Phil about soil grown cell uh

132
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,000
he mentioned to us that you know

133
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:40,120
starting at about 240 degrees doing a

134
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,120
15-second press finding out your

135
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:44,319
stability finding out your quality

136
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:47,038
finding out your yields that lets you

137
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:49,319
know from there that you can move down

138
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:50,800
uh in temperature and you know notice

139
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:53,360
the differences that you get it's

140
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,240
obviously people don't want to waste

141
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,479
they want to get as much as they can but

142
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:59,800
they don't want to get especially us we

143
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:01,519
are not coming at this from the the

144
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,879
point where we want to get so much at

145
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:06,240
the expense of any of the quality or

146
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:07,800
flavor that's right you know so I I can

147
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,478
tell people out there already are saying

148
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,360
well then you got to press it all at

149
00:06:09,478 --> 00:06:14,279
180 you know there's definitely a higher

150
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:16,240
concentration of flavor in the lower

151
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:20,279
temperature

152
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:22,038
um uh presses but at the same time God

153
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:24,439
it's still such quality when it's

154
00:06:22,038 --> 00:06:26,318
pressed a little warmer and that snap in

155
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:27,918
and there's still tons of flavor in that

156
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:31,120
that's delicious absolutely this one is

157
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:34,719
kind of an in between um butter and

158
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,840
shatter texture thank you sir just

159
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:40,280
lovely nice to have you guys over for a

160
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:40,279
little dab session yeah it's yours

161
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:46,879
Mark

162
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,879
booah jeez it's a house

163
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:53,840
fire not bad at all all right here we

164
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:57,360
go like it it's a nice strong buzz off

165
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:01,280
that

166
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:04,160
Teflon yeah

167
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:08,478
a hashy kind of creamy taste it really

168
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:11,080
does great tasting oil for uh with you

169
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:11,079
know flour

170
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:21,400
rosin it's nice for me I got to admit

171
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:24,720
because for water hash for dry

172
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:28,120
sift I really need to have a decent

173
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:30,520
amount to be able to play with

174
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:33,280
rosin you can have a very small amount

175
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:34,719
of Bud and still get in the game yeah

176
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:36,198
and I think it's one one of the things

177
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,879
why it's going to be such a popular why

178
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:41,120
it is such a popular uh method and

179
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:42,680
growing every day because it's so easy

180
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:47,158
to get in the game I mean even this

181
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:49,199
machine for 2300 us is pretty amazing

182
00:07:47,158 --> 00:07:53,240
considering what you would spend on a a

183
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:54,639
butane closed loop extractor CO2 machine

184
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,918
any other machine that makes oil is

185
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,560
going to be a fairly high cost this is

186
00:07:56,918 --> 00:08:00,680
one of the higher end units on the

187
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,839
marketplace right now for commercial

188
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:06,519
production and it's you know a couple of

189
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:08,399
grand us three grand Canadian so I say

190
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:09,639
uh we're dabbed up let's get squish

191
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:10,839
let's uh let's get squishing I'm going

192
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:12,478
to head over to the other side of the

193
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:15,478
table and we're going to kind of operate

194
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:17,758
the press as a as a team here so let's

195
00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:20,439
do that now all right so we're over here

196
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:23,158
on the other side of the press and uh

197
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:25,759
basically real nice uh presentation we

198
00:08:23,158 --> 00:08:28,680
packed the the all screen mesh bags

199
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:31,520
exactly how Phil has requested uh

200
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:33,839
leaving a nice open sort of half well a

201
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:36,038
third of of the lip of screen which you

202
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,880
can just it's nice and packed in there

203
00:08:36,038 --> 00:08:40,598
and we're going to slap that into our

204
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:45,360
parchment unbleached crack that open for

205
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:49,759
me there d a little bit more that's

206
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,759
perfect try to get this kind of into

207
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:57,838
the some nice

208
00:08:53,759 --> 00:09:01,439
flow that's even tight like that's

209
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,440
pretty good A little bit more yeah

210
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:13,759
Perfect all

211

right all right gentlemen shall

212
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:18,559
we give that a little press or what go

213
00:09:19,029 --> 00:09:30,159
[Music]

214
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:30,159
ahead nice keep going a little

215
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:39,200
yep got a timer going

216
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,440
for all right pop it

217
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,278
open then you want to close that back

218
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:56,278
down so we can the plates

219
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:56,278
up

220
00:09:56,759 --> 00:10:00,958
yeah got a nice little collection there

221
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:02,759
it's nice and creamy just you want to

222
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:03,838
hold this guy by the I think God we

223
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:05,439
could have squish that more oh we're

224
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,839
going to squish it more for sure but

225
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,200
just to give these guys an idea of what

226
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:10,800
came out we were looking for about a

227
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,720
gram and a half of rosin and I would

228
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:15,199
definitely say we probably got about a

229
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,839
half to a gram so we probably got a

230
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,839
little bit more to go um do you want to

231
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:22,920
gra run that out and put it gently on

232
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:27,640
that metal piece out back

233
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:27,639
there close that up y

234
00:10:31,278 --> 00:10:36,159
I needed more pressure too like go down

235
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:37,958
a couple more times me

236
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:40,759
too cuz it

237
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:42,759
really really just started right at the

238
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:45,559
end I could start hearing it going but

239
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:48,559
the color on that oh the da we'll need

240
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:50,078
the Dabber look at that oh yeah oh yeah

241
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:52,359
we got most of it on one side from

242
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:56,919
closing it which is always a nice

243
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,919
maneuver yeah all right so

244
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:10,480
the color is incredible it's like the

245
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:10,479
creamiest lightest

246
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:25,480
blondest God does that feel right

247
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:25,479
between creamy and porn

248
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:32,759
sap God it just feels like ice cream I'm

249
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,879
serious holy

250
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:36,039
Mo all right so we'll find out how

251
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:42,200
efficient we

252
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:45,958
were by merely um getting this first

253
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,959
Wade so was a good

254
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:52,079
plan it'll be interesting to see how

255
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:53,680
much more squishes out of that on our

256
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:56,599
second Squish and it'll let us know what

257
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:58,078
we need to do for for time wise for

258
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,800
allowing it to squish out so yeah that

259
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:02,919
was about a half a gram so we definitely

260
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:05,879
have a good solid

261
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:08,838
like8 to another gram of of rosin that

262
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:10,720
should come out of uh out of the next

263
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:13,399
squish all right so we're just going to

264
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,360
do a quick little secondary press on

265
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:17,278
this

266
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:19,839
guy we weren't using all the pressure

267
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:23,198
I've also folded it in half just to let

268
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:26,000
you know there it's not pressing up as a

269
00:12:23,198 --> 00:12:30,799
whole flat piece I like to flatten it up

270
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,799
for my second one here we go

271
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:37,198
it

272
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:44,519
click you can always go

273
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:48,039
back that's what I thought it was going

274
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:51,078
to be like there you go blasted it out a

275
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:53,360
tiny little bit we blasted out the bud

276
00:12:51,078 --> 00:12:56,239
just the tiniest little

277
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:58,759
bit

278
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,480
but one little guy right there was

279
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:02,078
pretty good

280
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,639
but as you can

281
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:07,759
see we got that missing

282
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:09,519
gram so that gram we were looking for

283
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:11,198
here it is right here I would definitely

284
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,759
say that's probably about a gram

285
00:13:11,198 --> 00:13:14,278
compared to what that was and that's a

286
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:17,000
half gram you want to just go drop her

287
00:13:14,278 --> 00:13:18,679
on there for uh what I was saying is

288
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,399
when you're pressing such great quality

289
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:22,159
material and it's unfortunate that the

290
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,958
majority of the dispensaries this isn't

291
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:26,039
the easiest thing to find there's just

292
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:27,119
not a lot of supply of it there's not a

293
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:28,719
lot of supply of it lot of people want

294
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:32,240
to grow things that you know don't take

295
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,759
long to flower and yield a lot M and

296
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,399
these things the truth is they're harder

297
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:38,639
to grow you know where some things are

298
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:40,600
just easy to do it right as well yeah

299
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:44,519
well God bless those that are doing it

300
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,519
right how we doing on that

301
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:52,880
good wo jeez look at that just giant

302
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,879
pile of buty

303
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:09,120
and there we go right there guess and

304
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:15,240
that's about a

305
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:16,399
gram one one G so 1.5 G from s g yeah

306
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,440
there we go that's what we're looking

307
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,879
for pretty killer for sure uh we'll

308
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,959
press this out as well it's going to

309
00:14:19,879 --> 00:14:24,799
look a little bit darker there with the

310
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:27,638
uh how thick it is but I guarantee you

311
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:29,278
when we press out that uh thicker piece

312
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:31,879
it's not going to have a very different

313
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:34,679
color maybe a tiny tiny little bit

314
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:36,759
darker but we'll do that later as well

315
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:39,120
so that is but is that is the second

316
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:41,680
press too that is the second press yeah

317
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,078
so but a unique second press in the

318
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:45,638
sense of not the if we had gotten most

319
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:47,278
of that out and there was only a little

320
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:49,120
bit it almost protects itself when

321
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:51,120
there's a lot of it if there's less of

322
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,959
it you get this much darker color that

323
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,399
comes out of your rosin second presses

324
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:56,559
aren't usually very exciting in

325
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,159
particular if you've gotten 80 to 90%

326
00:14:56,559 --> 00:15:01,039
out in the first press but when you've

327
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:01,039
left

328
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:06,600
66% it still comes out pretty damn nice

329
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:08,198
we've got the pressure down we've got

330
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,759
the temperature down I think this next

331
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:14,198
squish we're going to go for like a 1.3

332
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:16,320
1.4 return on one squish so I think we

333
00:15:14,198 --> 00:15:18,559
can do it see what we can get I think we

334
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:21,800
have it in us do

335
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:21,799
it all

336
00:15:27,078 --> 00:15:30,958
right 219

337
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:47,359
open a little

338
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:53,240
more you want to open that up for me

339
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:05,559
nice little squish right there I'd say

340
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:08,120
we probably got about a gram on this one

341
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:09,719
maybe a tiny little bit less like 0.9 so

342
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,039
we' still got another point4 to get out

343
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,240
of our second Squish and we'll get a

344
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:14,198
little more efficient I think if we

345
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,639
would have left that for a little bit

346
00:16:14,198 --> 00:16:20,318
longer I think we would have seen our

347
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,318
close to full return uh

348
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:25,519
return God she's pretty

349
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:30,120
though yeah it's a nice color

350
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:34,720
got

351
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:34,720
going all right so more

352
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:46,799
collection 1.4

353
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:50,039
1.3 so we just pulled like 21

354
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:52,278
22% off of in a square so that's the

355
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:54,439
success we're looking for that's what we

356
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:57,159
want to do right there and you can see

357
00:16:54,440 --> 00:17:00,600
it's got a real turpy sort of almost wet

358
00:16:57,159 --> 00:17:02,719
look to it little bit of pulling pulling

359
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:05,279
uh snap texture to it but this is going

360
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:08,318
to be butter in a in a day or two and

361
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:11,519
man about 19 and a half% all right so

362
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:14,318
that was a great return 1.4 from

363
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:15,519
seven and as you can see an absolute

364
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:17,759
beautiful

365
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:19,959
quality you know pretty cool that you

366
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:25,279
can just go buy flowers and produce a

367
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:25,279
quality of of rosin like this

368
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,360
Max is going to collect this

369
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:51,519
up yeah

370
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:53,440
buddy all right okay so we just uh

371
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:55,639
pressed out a little bit of our first

372
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,320
batch there you can hold that up to the

373
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:00,200
camera real nice and close it'll if you

374
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:02,279
put it Clos enough it'll snap to it

375
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:05,360
perfect so I'm about to take a dab of

376
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:08,200
that nice little slice of pie I like how

377
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:12,000
Dom made it into a pie that's a very

378
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:12,000
nice uh very nice

379
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:26,279
touch wow that foamed up really nice

380
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,279
that almost looked like bubble has when

381
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:30,879
it was it stopped pretty quick in about

382
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:32,119
a second or two in it turned to just oil

383
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:36,440
that's why I kind of went to show you

384
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:36,439
but it was like done and it foamed up

385
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:47,879
nice lovely

386
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,880
strong

387
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:56,280
satiating let's get uh a piece of pie

388
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,159
for you I find actually that's not the

389
00:18:56,279 --> 00:19:00,000
right

390
00:18:57,159 --> 00:19:03,120
one that's not the right one there's the

391
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,119
pie that one's mine

392
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,840
actually my last nugget the

393
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:11,159
[Music]

394
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:11,158
Teflon that's so

395
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:15,720
delicious we should have a Cherry Pie

396
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:19,839
pizza

397
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:22,440
party many pieces of good things oh yeah

398
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:24,879
that just Foams up it looks totally like

399
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:29,080
foam out and then it dissipates within 2

400
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,080
seconds it dissipates

401
00:19:29,159 --> 00:19:32,799
little help we're friends for

402
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:40,000
cheers all right it's very good going to

403
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:42,759
get in here for a piece of uh cherry pie

404
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,839
there Don I just did that ninja dab oh

405
00:19:42,759 --> 00:19:47,279
you did the ninja dab first awesome okay

406
00:19:44,839 --> 00:19:50,000
the uh the Dabber let's get back to

407
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:52,079
pressing all right so we are grabbing

408
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,839
the

409
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:57,240
third third bag third bag of Teflon that

410
00:19:54,839 --> 00:20:00,000
we're about to press uh the last third

411
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:02,839
uh pouch that we pressed was actually 09

412
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,038
cookies and that uh that is this one

413
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:07,240
here and Dom's written all the

414
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:10,240
information out quite quite lovely the

415
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:13,279
09 top left corner 1.3 out of seven top

416
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:16,839
right corner third pouch First Press 60

417
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:18,599
seconds 220° Fahrenheit so uh We've

418
00:20:16,839 --> 00:20:21,240
lowered the temperature it's dropping

419
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:23,839
right now it's 2113 as I speak and we're

420
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:26,558
going to get it down to about

421
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:27,879
210 and 210 we're going to probably

422
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:30,399
press what do you guys think for a

423
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:32,400
minute a minute 15 yeah I can think

424
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,480
about a minute minute 15 see how see how

425
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:38,519
it sounds see how it smells maybe even I

426
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:41,880
mean I pressed uh 200 or 210 I pressed

427
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:43,119
210 at at 2 minutes and got my yield so

428
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:45,240
we'll check it out we'll see what's

429
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:46,678
going on of course uh it's always nice

430
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,319
to figure out your ratios without

431
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:50,320
sacrificing that second round you want

432
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:51,839
to get as much as uh you can out of that

433
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:54,839
first round and get that really lovely

434
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:56,959
color but uh I mean hey if you've left

435
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:58,639
some behind and it's more than a point

436
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,240
it's definitely worth going for so why

437
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:04,960
don't we put this one in

438
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,960
Teflon the Teflon

439
00:21:08,349 --> 00:21:15,278
[Laughter]

440
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:17,400
Dawn there's a little bit of the uh that

441
00:21:15,278 --> 00:21:20,720
kind of buttery rosin that came out

442
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,720
really beautiful

443
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:28,679
quality Dom said right away what did you

444
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:31,519
say I said I don't care about the yield

445
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:33,919
it's the best best press We Done Yet

446
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:36,558
boom Going

447
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:38,720
lower we're just collecting this rosin

448
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:40,359
and laughing at the sliver that's uh

449
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,159
good good looking out Max that's uh

450
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:43,879
that's proper right there so we

451
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,640
collected some lovely raw in here but

452
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:48,600
this big sliver just came off in one

453
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:54,919
piece and I thought that was pretty

454
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:57,158
uh pretty sweet all right so we'll just

455
00:21:54,919 --> 00:22:00,400
drop that in there Max is about to load

456
00:21:57,159 --> 00:22:02,320
is this our fifth pouch now this will be

457
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,759
the four right this will be our fifth

458
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:06,000
squish yeah yeah so this is our fifth

459
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:08,200
squish we've uh we're still at 210°

460
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,038
we're actually down a little lower

461
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:14,440
26° so uh never never a bad thing to go

462
00:22:12,038 --> 00:22:14,440
a little bit

463
00:22:15,558 --> 00:22:20,678
lower going in for the straight I like

464
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:20,678
it I like

465
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:27,240
[Music]

466
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:29,480
it look at the color of that it's like

467
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:31,919
brown sugar lots of it on here still so

468
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:34,159
we'll get that off in the okay I mean

469
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:37,080
not lots of it but enough that it's

470
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:39,919
we'll be collecting it this is so

471
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:43,879
nice that

472
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:48,799
buttery sappy it's like cake it is like

473
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:53,840
cake we just baked a cake a cherry pie

474
00:22:48,798 --> 00:22:53,839
cake it's like cake batter rosin good

475
00:22:55,599 --> 00:23:04,038
Lord there you are 4K

476
00:22:59,798 --> 00:23:04,038

477
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,278
goodness very

478
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:23,839
clean see what kind of you guys tighten

479
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,840
the paper

480
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:39,440
woo so that's what we just

481
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:41,159
uh produced I really got to get the

482
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,120
macro lens out there's all sorts of good

483
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:45,080
stuff going on

484
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:47,798
here would have been a great thing for

485
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:49,319
me to shoot each one on the Dabber but o

486
00:23:47,798 --> 00:23:51,359
just so much more

487
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:55,918
work all right so we're going in with

488
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:58,798
our fifth pouch correct gentlemen yes

489
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:02,200
yes we brought the temperature up to 211

490
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:05,200
de5 is that where you wanted it it's

491
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:06,679
exactly where we want it okay great so

492
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,400
we've got

493
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:12,038
uh we've got it right where we want it

494
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:16,880
200 two 212 now it's up

495
00:24:12,038 --> 00:24:16,879
to that's okay give her a

496
00:24:19,278 --> 00:24:23,038
shot all right so we're opening it up

497
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:26,240
here

498
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:28,919
215° pressed for about a minute and 45

499
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,240
seconds let's see the squish oh it looks

500
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:32,320
buttery and delicious you want to pull

501
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:35,759
that out for

502
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:39,000
me oh my gosh that looks real nice very

503
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:41,480
nice so we'll get that collected and do

504
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,519
the next squish uh all right we've got

505
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:48,200
press number seven here ready we've got

506
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:51,000
the 215 to 216° temperature in goes the

507
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:54,159
pouch Dom's working the

508
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,159
compressor all

509
00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:00,799
right how much I like a cultivar

510
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,440
you know we can look at these all we

511
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:07,200
want but the way you'd really tell what

512
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:08,880
are the best is by having them all and

513
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:12,319
which we will all have and we'll have to

514
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:16,360
let each other know which ones we smoked

515
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:18,918
first because that to me is the ultimate

516
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:21,918
test 50 more

517
00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:21,919
seconds

518
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:30,319
okay definitely more about

519
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:46,399
better rugs and okay so this is a second

520
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:49,080
press we're not too sure why we got an

521
00:25:46,398 --> 00:25:50,959
incredible quality off the last hit but

522
00:25:49,079 --> 00:25:53,240
it was only point4 and we've been

523
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:58,038
getting pretty pretty consistently like

524
00:25:53,240 --> 00:26:01,159
1.1 1.2 return you know 6.7 on a lower

525
00:25:58,038 --> 00:26:04,839
end but quite a few that hit over 1

526
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:04,840
point0 uh yeah go ahead

527
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:12,959
Max yeah all right here we go one minute

528
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:15,119
press nice little

529
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,159
squish we were wondering where the rest

530
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:18,599
of it

531
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:21,399
went tiny little blowout but we'll

532
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:21,398
collect only the

533
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:31,558
bottoms a little dark darker color like

534
00:26:29,398 --> 00:26:34,278
what happens with a second

535
00:26:31,558 --> 00:26:35,639
press yeah very nice you know looks

536
00:26:34,278 --> 00:26:37,079
nicer out here than it did in there

537
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:39,559
that's for

538
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:42,079
sure so a little bit of contaminant over

539
00:26:39,558 --> 00:26:44,639
on the edges here we'll avoid uh picking

540
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:48,240
that up but uh we'll

541
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:50,320
definitely very nice to have a big um

542
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,200
you know one of those lenses over top of

543
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:53,639
it that elderly people use to read it

544
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,159
would be nice to have that for rosin

545
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:57,440
collection because you could really with

546
00:26:55,159 --> 00:26:59,120
Precision avoid the contamination that's

547
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,600
in there all right so we're doing our

548
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:03,879
second uh pouch of the cookies we had

549
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:06,879
five cou pouches of cookies there's four

550
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:08,320

551
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,159
it at

552
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:12,200
212° and we're probably going to do

553
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:14,080
about a minute to a minute and 45

554
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:17,519
seconds yeah and we're going for the

555
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:17,519

556
00:27:19,398 --> 00:27:24,398
down 1 minute 45 seconds is this a

557
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:26,839

564
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:41,399
a mixture if you look at it here right

565
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:42,360
in here in particular you get this sort

566
00:27:41,398 --> 00:27:48,839
of

567
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:48,839

yeah

593
00:28:48,839 --> 00:28:53,359
incredible so a 10 degree difference

594
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:56,319
this was an accidental uh squish on our

595
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:58,119
third pouch when I was pressing uh uh

596
00:28:56,319 --> 00:28:59,839
squishing the Teflon and I accidentally

597
00:28:58,119 --> 00:29:01,479
grabed an 09 cooks and then this is the

598

% a little below less yeah eight8 and a

621

can oh yeah you can hear it

655
00:31:43,079 --> 00:31:48,278
bubbling P it open soon yeah it's there

656
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:48,278
taper

657
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:00,639
off just a second press on that one

658
00:31:58,558 --> 00:32:02,480
right there yep here you go fold it in

659
00:32:00,638 --> 00:32:04,038
half and get that pressed up all right

660
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:08,360
this is the second press we got a fairly

661
00:32:04,038 --> 00:32:11,519
low yield on that last pouch uh 3 came

662
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:13,879
out um you know still a minute and 45

663
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:15,720
seconds 212 de so it's really trippy I

664
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:17,360
don't know where the consistency is

665
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:20,639
being lost we're not seeing it super

666
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:21,918
often so it is an anomaly but uh we are

667
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:25,319
seeing

668
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:28,080
it oh yeah look at that that's there it

669
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:30,038
is

670
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:32,359
there's the

671
00:32:30,038 --> 00:32:34,319
uh there's that yield oh you want to

672
00:32:32,359 --> 00:32:37,158
grab that piece there no problem it's

673
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:40,278
nothing it's nothing worth nothing worth

674
00:32:37,159 --> 00:32:40,278
saving there we

675
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:47,159
go so there's that

676
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:49,320
yield

677
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:52,960
beautiful all right so that was our last

678
00:32:49,319 --> 00:32:57,000
press um where's the three right here so

679
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:59,798
we got we got A3 uh very low first year

680
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,880
uh return and then we hit it again uh

681
00:32:59,798 --> 00:33:03,359
for a little longer it looks quite dark

682
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,399
actually in this video right now but

683
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:08,240
it's

684
00:33:04,398 --> 00:33:11,278
actually not as dark as it looks but a

685
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:13,359
little bit darker for certain and a real

686
00:33:11,278 --> 00:33:17,200
nice smell to

687
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:19,599
it nice bouquet so we got our 20% yield

688
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:22,399
anyway and we managed to uh still get

689
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:26,158
that3 separated so a nice lighter

690
00:33:22,398 --> 00:33:28,879
color and I guess uh yeah we'll just get

691
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:30,760
these all lined up on the

692
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,440
all right boys what do you have to say

693
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:35,000
about what we got here so we did some

694
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:37,639
squishing today a couple different

695
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,319
flavors uh top side over here we got the

696
00:33:37,638 --> 00:33:42,398
09 cookies squared and then at the

697
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:44,678
bottom we got the Teflon all right and

698
00:33:42,398 --> 00:33:47,158
so what is the top row that is three

699
00:33:44,679 --> 00:33:50,519
versus the top the second row in the top

700
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:52,159
that is five are those all seconds these

701
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:54,519
are all our first presses so this was

702
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:56,880
the first poach second poach third

703
00:33:54,519 --> 00:33:58,759
fourth fifth poach so the first and

704
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:01,679
second we really were so efficient that

705
00:33:58,759 --> 00:34:03,798
there was really no need for a second

706
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:05,278
squish yeah we were content with the

707
00:34:03,798 --> 00:34:06,918
with the yield on those ones these ones

708
00:34:05,278 --> 00:34:09,320
we uh we figured there was definitely

709
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:10,960
more more left in the pouches so that's

710
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:13,559
why there's uh second presses and those

711
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:14,760
are the the top three here all right so

712
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:17,000
just to give them a little bit of a

713
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:18,599
better idea all the numbers written here

714
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,398
these are the second presses these top

715
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:22,039
three yeah and then these are all first

716
00:34:20,398 --> 00:34:24,319
presses this was The Accidental press

717
00:34:22,039 --> 00:34:25,838
that we did during the Teflon um this

718
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,280
was one of the first buttery ones that

719
00:34:25,838 --> 00:34:30,078
came out that we were really impressed

720
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:31,839
with and of course some uh inet on both

721
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:34,720
of these and even this third one little

722
00:34:31,838 --> 00:34:38,000
surprising when we only got the uh3 but

723
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:41,279
we squished out uh although dark still a

724
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:44,599
damn near gram of uh of nice rosin and

725
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:47,639
then down here we've got the Cherry Pie

726
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:50,399
Teflon yep Cherry Cherry Pie cross with

727
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:51,280
Wi-Fi Alien OG and 09 cookies the pie

728
00:34:50,398 --> 00:34:53,078
gave it

729
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:55,919
away all right and these are all the

730
00:34:53,079 --> 00:34:59,160
first presses on top or no yes exactly

731
00:34:55,918 --> 00:35:02,639
and what is this uh so that's a that's a

732
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:04,920
second press second press damn yeah that

733
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:06,559
looks really good for a second press so

734
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:08,440
this is a first press this is the first

735
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:10,078
this first this one came out and we were

736
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,559
just so happy I mean look at the color

737
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:14,480
on that it's just

738
00:35:11,559 --> 00:35:17,239
ridiculous another 1.6 on that one but a

739
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:19,800
second press of 6 much darker color no

740
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:21,399
doubt about it uh Phil soil grown s

741
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:24,320
absolutely told us that we would notice

742
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:27,320
that very lovely peaches color on this

743
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:30,119
one that one's nice 0.9 no second press

744
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:32,320
on that one one and then our point4 also

745
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:34,440
came out very nice color even lighter

746
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:38,880
than the one the peachy orange one but

747
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:38,880
more lemony and yellow esque

748
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:45,039
so I would say that is a success what do

749
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:47,880
you guys say that we each pick one to

750
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:50,679
dab on and finish this video with a nice

751
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:53,358
dab think we can do that

752
00:35:50,679 --> 00:35:56,358
excellent all right so this is the one

753
00:35:53,358 --> 00:35:58,559
that Max is choosing as you can see a

754
00:35:56,358 --> 00:36:01,358
finely buttered with mild shatter

755
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:04,199
consistency to it a first bag a second

756
00:36:01,358 --> 00:36:06,078
bag First Press minute and 45 seconds

757
00:36:04,199 --> 00:36:08,960
2111 fhe

758
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:10,960
1.2 out of seven so there's no second

759
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,440
press on that one and uh that's the one

760
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,199
Max is going to be hitting all right Max

761
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:15,440
is going to take his rip we'll check

762
00:36:14,199 --> 00:36:19,919
this

763
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:19,920
out definitely a lovely foam to

764
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:28,079
it and this is the on Cooks 9

765
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:28,079
cookies 09 cookies

766
00:36:31,159 --> 00:36:36,920
how does how does that sound it's it's

767
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:38,838
it tastes really nice consistent with

768
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:40,800
the flower taste that you're used to and

769
00:36:38,838 --> 00:36:42,239
the and the the color of it was really

770
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,000
nice too when it was actually foaming it

771
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:46,039
was very light it foamed up light brown

772
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,318
for sure we'll try and show you that as

773
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:51,000
well the on cookies is strong too got

774
00:36:49,318 --> 00:36:51,920
quite a lot of quite a lot of horsepower

775
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,920
to

776
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,318
it all right Dom which one are you

777
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:59,400
picking I'm going to go with the Teflon

778
00:36:56,318 --> 00:37:01,358
and I'm going to go with the third pouch

779
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,880
going base purely off looks we got a

780
00:37:01,358 --> 00:37:04,759
really nice buttery batch out of there

781
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,079
nice you g to squeeze off a piece of

782
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:07,240
that bar or what I think that's what I'm

783
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:11,800
going to go for right there I like that

784
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:11,799
I think that's a good idea boom it's on

785
00:37:11,838 --> 00:37:16,920
secured all right so we're going to

786
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,920
catch the foam on this

787
00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:29,519
one much darker color but it's lighting

788
00:37:25,318 --> 00:37:29,519
lightening up now there at the end boom

789
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:43,358
[Music]

790
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:48,838
rip I like Max coughing for Dom's hit

791
00:37:43,358 --> 00:37:48,838
that was bros I'm still feeling that

792
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:54,359
09 all right so now it is my choice

793
00:37:52,519 --> 00:37:57,838
tough choice that it is I just want to

794
00:37:54,358 --> 00:38:02,159
kind of puff on all of them but uh you

795
00:37:57,838 --> 00:38:02,159
know I think I am going to go

796
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:07,039
for the point

797
00:38:05,239 --> 00:38:09,279
for

798
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:12,480
teflon wow

799
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,480
crazy good

800
00:38:12,519 --> 00:38:16,480
choice that one's one of the brightest

801
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:20,680
actually she came off

802
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:24,000
nice she's definitely active

803
00:38:20,679 --> 00:38:28,000
yeah all right here we go Dabber

804
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,000
nearby salute

805
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:46,279
wow taste was on point powerful strong

806
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:49,679
for for certain really tasted

807
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:49,680
that cherry

808
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:58,639
pie I do appreciate the way that mildly

809
00:38:54,440 --> 00:39:00,000
shatter in between butter Ros and r rips

810
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:02,719
seems to grab you a little differently

811
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,199
than the TP Rich butter which also I

812
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:06,919
can't say which one is better but it's

813
00:39:05,199 --> 00:39:09,118
just personal preference I went for that

814
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:12,960
one because of its shininess and its

815
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:16,800
color yeah anyway super big shout out to

816
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:18,800
soil grown s uh for the sasqua Rosen

817
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,640
press and his whole team over there
