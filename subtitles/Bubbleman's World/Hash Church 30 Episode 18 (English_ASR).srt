87
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,879

years after being in

California uh and started um developing

90
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:53,400
methods to elucidate the chemical

91
00:03:49,878 --> 00:03:57,438
constituents that are in the plant and

92
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:59,400
um use that methods those methods to

93
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:02,560

117
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:10,759

138
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:58,918
on my channel as well uh once they've

139
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:01,080
gotten past trying to whatever they're

140
00:05:58,918 --> 00:06:03,038
doing with the IR iring uh you know

141
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:05,318
contacts and whatnot with it but yeah it

142
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:05,318
was a

143
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:09,639
great yeah it was was interesting it's

144
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:11,079
funny there a whole group of people that

145
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:13,960
kind of freaked out about it think it's

146
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:15,918
something that it isn't just not to be

147
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:18,719
surprised in the Cannabis

148
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:20,038
industry but uh yeah I mean it's just

149
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,039
talking about basic breeding it's

150
00:06:20,038 --> 00:06:26,800
nothing too in depth

151
00:06:22,038 --> 00:06:28,439
or um I don't know conspiratorial minded

152
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,478
It's funny when you start talking about

153
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:33,360
cannabis breeding in the post phos world

154
00:06:31,478 --> 00:06:36,159
everybody thinks that it's all about big

155
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,038
companies coming in to steal your [ __ ]

156
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,880
and I don't think they realize that you

157
00:06:38,038 --> 00:06:42,000
know I mean there's 500 licensed

158
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:44,159
companies in Canada that are

159
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,038
operating um so there's like yeah there

160
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,120
are some big cars but in case anybody

161
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:50,240
hasn't been paying attention they're

162
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:52,759
failing big time in the

163
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,960
marketplace and a lot of the smaller

164
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:56,520
cultivators that you know have a smaller

165
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:58,878
footprint and put a lot more care into

166
00:06:56,519 --> 00:07:01,918
their flowers are starting to do sales

167
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:04,360
and and do a decent amount of sales and

168
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:07,560
you know maybe they're not multi-billion

169
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:09,080
dollar businesses but they're successful

170
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,399
cultivators providing flowers to the

171
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:13,000
market a lot of these people are

172
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:15,239
transitions from the Legacy Marketplace

173
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,240
so I don't know I

174
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:22,120
just the the whole conspiracy thing is

175
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:24,160
is is kind of funny but H I was a bit

176
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:27,519
disappointed by it I will be honest when

177
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,800
you said uh that Sam had posted on IC

178
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:29,758
mag I was like oh I want to go check it

179
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,400
out and see what people people are

180
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:35,840
saying and I I was kind of disappointed

181
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:38,000
to see the sort of low brow level of of

182
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:39,560
I was just like oh man this must be why

183
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,680
I don't really post on the boards

184
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,360
anymore like which is hard for me to say

185
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,439
because those boards and I I don't turn

186
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,960
my back on those boards easily they were

187
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:49,719
everything to us you know like when when

188
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:51,918
the Cannabis Cup only existed in

189
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:54,520
Amsterdam and the only boards were

190
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:56,878
overgrow in cannabis world and you know

191
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:58,839
cannabis St like these these boards were

192
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,680
everything to us they were the community

193
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:03,519
we didn't have the social media we were

194
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,158
segregated onto these small little

195
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:06,918
platforms and they really were

196
00:08:05,158 --> 00:08:09,639
everything and and when I look back at

197
00:08:06,918 --> 00:08:11,719
it now I I mean I went into the IC mag

198
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:14,598
chat yesterday just to kind of try and

199
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:16,199
like even see what everyone was up to in

200
00:08:14,598 --> 00:08:18,240
there and it just seems like it's really

201
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:20,120
stagnant I it's it's like I guess we

202
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,759
left those boards and we started sharing

203
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:25,079
this information everywhere else almost

204
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:26,720
but those boards thank God for you Sam

205
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:28,318
because you're still on there sharing

206
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,879
valid information do you find that

207
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:33,918
there's still decent dialogue to be

208
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,918
found on the board

209
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:43,439
Sam Sam paging skunkman Sam he's like

210
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:46,399

00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:58,399
self- muted myself how in the the day

215
00:08:55,958 --> 00:09:00,278
are you right now just out of curiosity

216
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,360
what what is that now I said how many

217
00:09:00,278 --> 00:09:05,439
bong rips into your day are you

218
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:10,200
currently oh I know exactly I counted on

219
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:13,399
my uh iPhone uh it's

220
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,800
792 that's impressive so yeah about the

221
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:16,480
boards though do you find that there's

222
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:19,039
quality conversation and dialogue

223
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:22,839
happening on these on these well let's

224
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:26,439
say that there's uh a handful or two

225
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:28,800
handfuls of individuals who are capable

226
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:32,640
of discussing it without you know

227
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:35,000
sinking down to aluminum

228
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:36,360
hats and they're they're not all on this

229
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,799
podcast right

230
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:45,200
now uh no because uh there's a few I

231
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:47,078
know who are quite nice people and

232
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,800
privately message me saying they

233
00:09:47,078 --> 00:09:51,799
appreciate what I'm doing but whatever I

234
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:55,399
mean if you're really interested check

235
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:58,759
out the uh bibliography that I have

236
00:09:55,399 --> 00:10:01,320
posted that's maybe the most interesting

237
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:01,319
thing

238
00:10:06,278 --> 00:10:08,600
that's

239
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:17,480
all you're muted Marcus we can't hear

240
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:19,159
you sir yeah sorry guys I'm just talking

241
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:21,120
to myself I wanted to welcome Jeremy

242
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:23,879
Plum to the room this is a gentleman

243
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,839
that for some reason I just did not know

244
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:27,879
in the industry like our paths have not

245
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:30,360
crossed but in the last few days since

246
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:33,240
the segra panel catching him on

247
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:36,440
clubhouse uh and listening to him speak

248
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:38,720
uh so absolutely passionately and

249
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:40,600
eloquently I think I'm not the only one

250
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,399
that shares that sort of perspective

251
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,480
it's absolutely a joy and a pleasure to

252
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:47,519
have you here on hash Church Jeremy

253
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,639
thank you for showing up and honored to

254
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:52,200
be with you Marcus uh really excited to

255
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:54,000
see the crew and I remember one day in

256
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,959
the Netherlands where we ended up at

257
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Sam's and had a few bong rips and Sam

258
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:01,399
helped me to understand the error of my

259
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,759
way and that the open cannabis project

260
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:05,759
was a [ __ ] terrible bomb about ready

261
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:07,879
to detonate I think he was one of the

262
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:10,000
first people who said you know with

263
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:11,879
absolutely no minced words that that was

264
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,679
not going to work in any sort of way

265
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:16,679
shape or form just appreciating that

266
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:19,159
moment when we were together in the

267
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:20,759
Netherlands um anyways so great to be

268
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:23,278
here really really a joy to connect on

269
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:26,078
clubhouse too seeing some like amazing

270
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:28,519
dialogue and really really the level of

271
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:31,838
depth and conversation that just keeps

272
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:34,039
it going keeps it growing it's funny you

273
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,880
know I think I have pictures of of all

274
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:37,480
of us together outside that restaurant

275
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:40,120
in Amsterdam so I'm amazed that you guys

276
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:44,639
didn't cross paths before then I think I

277
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:47,799
do too Ryan yeah yeah it's pretty

278
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:49,839
amusing Jeremy's good [ __ ] he uh been a

279
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:52,278
good friend for the last few years I

280
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,959
when we cross pass Jeremy I think it was

281
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:55,919
2013 or

282
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:58,000
2014 when you were speaking at the

283
00:11:55,919 --> 00:12:00,039
emerald Cup on tpin with

284
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,799
Mark um

285
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:04,599
but yeah Jeremy for those don't know he

286
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:07,199
runs proof cultivation or does the

287
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,959
cultivation and data analytics I guess

288
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,278
well why don't you tell us what you're

289
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:10,679
doing at proof I'm gonna let you put it

290
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:12,679
in your own words Jeremy because it's

291
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:16,078
some pretty impressive stuff down at

292
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:18,838
proof and thank you Ryan I I admit I I

293
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:20,439
just know that uh to have this time with

294
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:22,000
you guys actually like means a lot I

295
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:24,680
haven't been on social media in two

296
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,039
years until the last 24 hours and just

297
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:28,799
kind of went underground because

298
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:30,639
primarily proof has been the total focus

299
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:32,559
I really gave everything like every

300
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:35,000
minute of every day for the last four

301
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:37,159
years pretty much to turn the ship I

302
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,078
took over this uh high-tech sort of

303
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:41,719
indoor controlled environment facility

304
00:12:39,078 --> 00:12:43,799
about four and a half years ago and it's

305
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:46,040
been quite a ride when I started there

306
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:48,198
was a huge amount of pest pressure and

307
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:50,519
all kinds of issues but bottom line is

308
00:12:48,198 --> 00:12:53,359
we are now actually by sales data the

309
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:55,159
top producer in Oregon we're all organic

310
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,360
cultivation I've been the director of

311
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:58,759
production science I've had an Ops

312
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,159
director that's kind of my right-hand

313
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:02,759
guy that ran a Microsoft Factory and

314
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:05,319
helped me to really bring like lean

315
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:08,159
manufacturing and some really stringent

316
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:09,440
approaches to consistent execution and I

317
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:12,120
think we've done a lot of exciting

318
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:14,120
things we've done photobiology trials in

319
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,720
partnership with a bunch of different uh

320
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:19,078
University folks that have like Dave

321
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,120
Holly from fluence and presented some

322
00:13:19,078 --> 00:13:22,559
data on Far red wavelength at the

323
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,360
Cannabis science conference a couple

324
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:26,919
years ago we've done incredible Agronomy

325
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,159
I think right now I'm in this huge

326
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:31,599
Wormhole of balancing minerals and

327
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:33,759
really understanding sort of Nutrition

328
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,720
By diverse variety at a level that

329
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:37,838
completely surpasses anything that I've

330
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,639
experienced in the past being able to

331
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,639
respond to some of the erratic and

332
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:43,600
interesting things that show up that you

333
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:46,480
know were entirely Organic Crop

334
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,560
Production but also uh just excited to

335
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,879
see the constantly booming yield by

336
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:53,799
virtue of pursuing the data to the N

337
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:55,039
degree one of the coolest Parts was uh I

338
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:57,120
actually worked with a team from

339
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:59,879
Colorado that does a lot of data science

340
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,120
and analytics we built a custom platform

341
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:03,799
called proos that essentially was an

342
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:06,198
environmental control system with a

343
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:09,599
bunch of extra features to bring in

344
00:14:06,198 --> 00:14:11,879
phenotyping capabilities um back in the

345
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,440
day I actually did do some phenotyping

346
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:17,000
partnership with phos but then that all

347
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,440
of course went to [ __ ] um so there's a

348
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,679
bunch of other partners that I've worked

349
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,839
with to do basic stuff we don't have any

350
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:24,278
kind of geneic science per se happening

351
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:26,680
other than what we're doing with

352
00:14:24,278 --> 00:14:29,198
cultivar Discovery we've had some great

353
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:32,000
seed sifts gone through about population

354
00:14:29,198 --> 00:14:34,559
of thousand seeds and had all kinds of

355
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,759
exciting sort of really unique varieties

356
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:38,599
come out um I've of course been working

357
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:40,440
on my own hybrids for a long time but at

358
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,360
proof I've been able to actually grow

359
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:44,399
many of them out and see some really

360
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:46,639
exciting things like this dog walker

361
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:49,240
strawberry Malawi cut that actually has

362
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:51,560
the recessive pining uh expression and

363
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:53,879
is getting like 6% total oil of all

364
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:55,958
Alpha and beta pining um I found an

365
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:58,198
array of other really exciting type ones

366
00:14:55,958 --> 00:15:00,319
but been principally focused on type two

367
00:14:58,198 --> 00:15:02,639
hybrids I have a plant called astral

368
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,278
works that I read years ago it's won a

369
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,039
bunch of gold medals actually one of the

370
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:08,519
sweet spots I'll just share this this

371
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:10,759
was a cross-section of my life where in

372
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:12,959
October I won a gold medal at the

373
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:14,480
cultivation classic which was an event

374
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:16,518
that I founded five years ago with

375
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,920
Congressman Bloomin hour it's become the

376
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:20,799
largest craft cannabis event in Oregon

377
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:23,479
and of course Ryan you came and blessed

378
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:25,519
us and many others have have joined over

379
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:27,720
the years but uh pandemic has [ __ ] all

380
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,399
that up but anyways it was amazing to

381
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,680
kind of close the gap on the supply

382
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:34,000
chain where as works the plant that I

383
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:36,198
bred won the gold medal in the type two

384
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,318
category at the event that IID started

385
00:15:36,198 --> 00:15:40,318
which then was grown in the facility I

386
00:15:38,318 --> 00:15:42,519
direct and then sold at the retail I

387
00:15:40,318 --> 00:15:44,679
founded called Pharma and it was like

388
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:46,318
each one of these things to me are weird

389
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:48,439
in their own way you know they're

390
00:15:46,318 --> 00:15:50,360
distinct from the other versions of

391
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:52,639
those things happening elsewhere and I'm

392
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:55,039
just trying to in my own way build a

393
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,680
small narrative about some of the themes

394
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:59,039
that I've learned from you and a lot of

395
00:15:56,679 --> 00:16:01,679
other people here certainly Mark and

396
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:03,719
just uh Sam and Marcus and they're

397
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:05,399
trying to build this kind of different

398
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,519
version of the supply chain while I'm

399
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:09,440
watching you know all the capitalist

400
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,039
crashing going around in in the market

401
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,560
down here of course everybody's going

402
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:15,039
[ __ ] crazy now with Federal

403
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:16,758
regulatory reform around the corner and

404
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:19,599
there's lots of like stupid money coming

405
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:21,360
in again after a pretty big deficit four

406
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,879
years ago we didn't understand what

407
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,680
would happen with the supply glut we

408
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:28,919
expected it but then had to ride through

409
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:31,439
that and it's been a incredible effort

410
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:33,958
and efficiency and being pragmatic but

411
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,720
also pursuing as much research as I can

412
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:37,359
so some really exciting things in the

413
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,879
controlled environment there and would

414
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,039
love to get to share more about some of

415
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:43,159
the strategies I've uncovered that have

416
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:45,399
really helped to evoke some of the most

417
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:47,000
expressive chem of ours and just really

418
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:48,720
thrilled about what's going on but I've

419
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,600
also finished my employment contract and

420
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,560
now I'm engaged with a number of uh

421
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,240
different producers internationally I

422
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:55,919
have a partnership in New Zealand that

423
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,680
I'm really excited about because they're

424
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:59,439
doing [ __ ] differently there's a mauy

425
00:16:57,679 --> 00:17:02,039
owned company there called Rua

426
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,959
bioscience uh Ethan and I were there in

427
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:05,720
January or February right as the

428
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:07,279
pandemic was hitting and I'm really

429
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,959
excited about what they're doing they

430
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:11,879
have a different sort of ethical spine

431
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:14,400
than what you typically see here it's

432
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:16,240
it's a little it's pretty inspiring but

433
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,679
anyways that's some of the stuff there's

434
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,959
also actually one other thing I should

435
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,240
mention Ryan there's a cool new Advisory

436
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:22,880
Board role that I've just started I

437
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:26,720
don't know if anybody's heard of Dr

438
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:28,960
Barry BC Barry is an MD from Colorado

439
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:32,200
who for 50 years has been going between

440
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:34,558
Nepal and Colorado and in Nepal at kman

441
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:36,640
do University he's brought together a

442
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:38,918
team that I think will probably over

443
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,600
time ambition to include many of you

444
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:42,960
it's called the multi-dimensional

445
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:44,439
Cannabis Research Center and they

446
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,480
they're building this really cool

447
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:48,679
International collaboration near Center

448
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,120
of origin just have some great vision

449
00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:51,519
about how he's approaching that and

450
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:53,000
really including like you know

451
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:54,558
everything in the kitchen sink and the

452
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,359
kind of research and approach they're

453
00:17:54,558 --> 00:17:59,440
doing um hoping you know postvaccine

454
00:17:57,359 --> 00:18:00,959
getting out there in October getting to

455
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,320
check up on them but that's another neat

456
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,519
thing that's just been bubbling anyways

457
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:08,079
just [ __ ] great to get to be together

458
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:11,038
with family on a Sunday with a lot of

459
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:14,439
bows to look forward to and ideas to

460
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:17,000
share shout out to Nepal um shout out to

461
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:18,440
markk Rose and jti and the whole Nepali

462
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,200
family who have been making and

463
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:23,679
producing Bubble Bags uh almost since

464
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:26,400
day one my wife sewed up the first ones

465
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:28,480
and we've had them made in Catman de

466
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,280
ever since so that's awesome to hear

467
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,400
that that's going down in Catman do and

468
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:35,200
Mike Rose actually recently got in touch

469
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,840
with us which is really exciting because

470
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,600
he has a beautiful piece of property

471
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:41,599
outside of Catman do that he wants to

472
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:44,000
completely and fully convert to

473
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:48,439
regenerative agriculture in Nepal he's

474
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:52,440
already burying logs on Contour in the

475
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:54,960
hillside fully ready to sink and

476
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:57,960
recharge the land with water and build

477
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,880
the microbiology for those very

478
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:03,679
extremely rare Cult of ours that can

479
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:06,919
show up in Nepal at times big up to Mark

480
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:10,960

00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,440
two cannabis thank you thank you thank

483
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:19,039
you thank you because I really think

484
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,038
that's where the magic in healing

485
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:24,839
is why don't we get into a little bit of

486
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:26,359
that conversation the different types of

487
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:27,639
cannabis you know just for I mean

488
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:29,199
obviously you guys are all at the

489
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:31,320
highest caliber but it would be nice for

490
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,640
some of the listeners to say hey what

491
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:33,639
what does he what did he mean by type

492
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,919
two

493
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:39,640
cannabis I could probably take a stab at

494
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:41,400
that Marcus we uh love that we we we

495
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:44,038
we've been in type Twos for a long time

496
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:47,000
they're they're tasty um but what's cool

497
00:19:44,038 --> 00:19:51,200
is you type one cannabis is Mo most of

498
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:53,839
us are aware is high TC cannabis was

499
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:58,880
previously defined as having both two

500
00:19:53,839 --> 00:20:00,759
btbt Al the TCA synthes genes

501
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:04,760
um type three cannabis is essentially

502
00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:08,200
your hemp um mostly CBD or not

503
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:11,119
containing THC as we are learning that

504
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:15,720
hemp is defined by an arbitrary metric

505
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:18,839
of less than 3% thca and not much else

506
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:22,159
um and type two cannabis arises when you

507
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:25,959
breed a a type one parental with a type

508
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:29,960
three parental and you get some sort of

509
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:34,079
mixture of uh THC and CBD in the

510
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:36,798
flower um and we I think one of our

511
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:39,558
really good favorite people molecular

512
00:20:36,798 --> 00:20:42,000
Farms they started really focus on

513
00:20:39,558 --> 00:20:45,519
creating parental lines in the type one

514
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:50,759
world and the type three World I.E hemp

515
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:53,038
and THC only plants Ryan helped uh lay

516
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:56,079
the foundations for that breeding

517
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:58,759
program and what's really cool is they

518
00:20:56,079 --> 00:21:00,519
created parentals of type three hemp

519
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:02,720
that have all of the noses that are

520
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:04,879
commercially favorable and even some

521
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:07,079
other noses that you know don't exist in

522
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,039
the marketplace you know that they have

523
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:11,480
a hemp line well technically it's not

524
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:15,359
hemp because it will it will go hot and

525
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:18,240
have approximately 6% thca but it smells

526
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:20,599
exactly like OG Kush so if you take that

527
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,319
type one that smells like OG Kush and

528
00:21:20,599 --> 00:21:25,000
the type three that smells exactly like

529
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:28,038
OG Kush and you hybridize them they will

530
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:32,200
create a homozygous seed line that has a

531
00:21:28,038 --> 00:21:35,319
nose that's OG Kush and then a thca to

532
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:38,319
cbda ratio that will vary depending on

533
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:40,918
the parental um certain parentals will

534
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:45,119
yield and the most common and most

535
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:48,840
dominant uh parentals yield seeds with

536
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:50,918
one to two THC to CBD so it' be a CBD

537
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:53,480
dominant plant but then there are other

538
00:21:50,919 --> 00:21:55,080
parentals that yield one to one and

539
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,880
others yet that yield two to one and

540
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:59,599
four to one and so forth and some are

541
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,640
mixed chemotype as they breathe out like

542
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:03,798
uh you know you'll have a a scatter of

543
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:06,720
them and similarly if you take a type

544
00:22:03,798 --> 00:22:09,798
two plant and you cross it with another

545
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:13,038
type two plant you'll get type one two

546
00:22:09,798 --> 00:22:16,440
and three back out in that F1 population

547
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:20,278
because it segregates so as blessing may

548
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:22,600
be when they passed the farm bill uh we

549
00:22:20,278 --> 00:22:25,319
had groups sitting on parentals of type

550
00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:28,038
three hemp that has all the beautiful

551
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:30,599
noses and they're still being hoarded

552
00:22:28,038 --> 00:22:35,640
because the first two lines they leted

553
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:38,839
out were legendary OG and Jack's blend

554
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:41,919
and Heavenly pepper there three and

555
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:46,240
there wasn't any real hemp with tpine

556
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:47,600
dominant noses in it uh prior to that

557
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,480
and the very next year of course

558
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:52,000
everybody had tpine dominant so some of

559
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:54,679
these more exotic noses they're hoarding

560
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,919
until there's a way to create or find a

561
00:22:54,679 --> 00:22:59,440
group of farmers who want to exclusively

562
00:22:56,919 --> 00:23:01,960
grow these you know EX IC pineapple

563
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:04,320
hemps and all this different stuff but

564
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:07,360
uh it's really cool the way that that

565
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:09,720
you can create those parental

566
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:11,158
lines thanks for sharing I was wondering

567
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,798
maybe Ryan if you could get into a

568
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:14,320
little bit about what Mark was referring

569
00:23:12,798 --> 00:23:16,460
to when he said you laid some of that

570
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:18,319
ground

571
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:20,798
[Music]

572
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:24,759
work I was one of the first employees at

573
00:23:20,798 --> 00:23:26,480
Nao so I was kind of brought into set up

574
00:23:24,759 --> 00:23:29,558
the breeding programs

575
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:33,120
really um

576
00:23:29,558 --> 00:23:35,759
yeah so I mean we just we just you know

577
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:38,719
we the group down there had a bunch of

578
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:40,839
affiliations with dispensaries and the

579
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:44,839
idea was to get some novel medicines for

580
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:46,720
these dispensaries and so um through

581
00:23:44,839 --> 00:23:50,158
like a really big kind of M Market

582
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:51,919
survey using a really sophisticated

583
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,880
laboratory that we

584
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:57,520
built we were able to to see what

585
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,120
chemotypes existed in the marketplace

586
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:01,000
right essentially it was just to you're

587
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:02,839
just running thousands of of samples

588
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,519
through the lab and cataloging all the

589
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:07,319
the turpine profiles and the canono

590
00:24:04,519 --> 00:24:09,119
profiles and in doing so when you're

591
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:10,639
starting to organize the data you

592
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:13,079
realize that there's groupings that

593
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,559
again Mark can talk more about that um

594
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:18,119
it's kind of he's

595
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:20,200
been pull I I want to talk about all the

596
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:22,479
hugs you had to give me because of the

597
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:24,080
freaking Girl Scout cookies vaporizer

598
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,640
incidents where you know the panic

599
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:28,759
attack came in I was like man I wish we

600
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:31,520
had a Girl Scout cookies type to so I

601
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:31,519
wouldn't feel this

602
00:24:32,278 --> 00:24:37,159
way yeah well I mean I don't know it's a

603
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:38,759
different crowd here I mean I think most

604
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:41,000
of the hash churches are probably like

605
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:42,839
pretty heavy type one dabbers so you

606
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,919
know dabbing the the plants that are you

607
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:49,278
know 25 to 30 plus THC acid percentage

608
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:50,960
um and in certain people that can induce

609
00:24:49,278 --> 00:24:53,319
anxiety when you hit it if you if you

610
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:56,240
take a big dab and we were rocking the

611
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:58,798
volcano back in the day uh down at the

612
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:01,480
farm or one of the Farms

613
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:05,158
and um Mark yeah mark would have these

614
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:06,839
like anxiety moments where he'd have a

615
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:08,440
big dab and would freak out but was

616
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:09,720
going I don't think it was only the THC

617
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,240
I mean you had a pretty high pressure

618
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:14,360
life at that point in time a lot was on

619
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:16,640
the line but um like I think your body

620
00:25:14,359 --> 00:25:19,558
changes over time too because in college

621
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:21,559
you know I I'd get hot I'd get rosted

622
00:25:19,558 --> 00:25:24,079
before every pra practice and every

623
00:25:21,558 --> 00:25:25,519
football game I get high all before

624
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:28,678
tests and everything wouldn't have a

625
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:31,038
problem with high THC and then it's like

626
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:33,200
I don't know get a little older a little

627
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:35,119
wiser got more bills to pay I don't know

628
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:38,080
it's kind of interesting but the type

629
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:41,199
twos are are perfect like you can I can

630
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:44,918
smoke as much of a 1.5 to one like high

631
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:47,360
higher THC and CBD and I get high I get

632
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:50,240
good it lasts longer I just don't get

633
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:52,319
the the where's my keys or the what the

634
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:55,319
[ __ ] what's going on you know what I

635
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:57,720
mean about feeling good it's about

636
00:25:55,319 --> 00:25:59,278
feeling good as versus how high can you

637
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:01,679
get you can tear the top of your head

638
00:25:59,278 --> 00:26:04,558
off with enough THC and it doesn't feel

639
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:06,360
good I love THC but I've had too much a

640
00:26:04,558 --> 00:26:11,158
couple times in my life and it's just

641
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:14,038
not fun type twos type twos uh they dab

642
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:17,360
beautifully and there's just this

643
00:26:14,038 --> 00:26:19,558
physical as well as mental experience of

644
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:22,199
feeling good which there's nothing wrong

645
00:26:19,558 --> 00:26:24,000
with feeling good yeah Mark's another

646
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:26,278
interesting thing about the Ty twos that

647
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,960
we discovered at the cultivation classic

648
00:26:26,278 --> 00:26:32,440
which Dr ad Ray ran the back end as a

649
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:34,720
neuroscientist evaluating judges who

650
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:36,798
were actually like a massive group over

651
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:39,839
many years were actually going to

652
00:26:36,798 --> 00:26:41,839
publish and sometime shortly I think uh

653
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:44,278
in the next hopefully month or two this

654
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:46,798
piece that summarizes all the findings

655
00:26:44,278 --> 00:26:49,599
one of the most interesting things the

656
00:26:46,798 --> 00:26:53,119
women overwhelmingly when blinded and

657
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:55,199
randomized selected type two and so we

658
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:56,839
created this women's Choice Award that

659
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,200
was you know I don't think there has

660
00:26:56,839 --> 00:27:01,959
been trials like this with contemporary

661
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:04,640
product a large population over time

662
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:06,558
with rigorous analytics and the sort of

663
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,840
credibility that 80 brings to the

664
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:11,319
research piece so really exciting to see

665
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:13,480
that here's a product mix issue and not

666
00:27:11,319 --> 00:27:15,319
serving you know this broad demographic

667
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:17,960
and like being inclusive with all the

668
00:27:15,319 --> 00:27:19,918
people coming in that I also agree that

669
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:22,319
just with everything Mark said I I

670
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:25,278
really genuinely like I really love type

671
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:28,480
twos in the daytime I I absolutely feel

672
00:27:25,278 --> 00:27:30,480
grounded focused and able to have kind

673
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:33,000
of really really tight focus on a task

674
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:35,079
and carry through to complete execution

675
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,599
I like the type ones a lot more in the

676
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:39,278
night I mean it's just that's been a lot

677
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:41,639
of the Rhythm but I currently have about

678
00:27:39,278 --> 00:27:43,038
14 different type twos and of course

679
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:45,519
we're working on different tpping

680
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:47,640
dominance as Works was a terpinolene

681
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:49,159
dominant type to which was funny because

682
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:51,000
it definitely I got some of that

683
00:27:49,159 --> 00:27:53,240
feedback there was certainly some people

684
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,839
that that was not a positive thing for

685
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:56,839
and then a lot of others that have

686
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:58,959
really loved it for me it's a little bit

687
00:27:56,839 --> 00:28:00,959
psychedelic I I absolutely have an

688
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,480
altered state of consciousness that's

689
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,919
distinct from just high THC there's

690
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:07,919
there's a kind of an expansive state

691
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,720
that I think it's beautiful and I love

692
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,360
the idea that there's a way in which

693
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:13,798
this might open the door to a whole lot

694
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:16,199
of people that are not currently um

695
00:28:13,798 --> 00:28:18,240
engaging with cannabis Therapeutics to

696
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:20,440
kind of replace way more harmful things

697
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,399
and have a sustainable lifelong

698
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:24,159
relationship with our with this

699
00:28:22,398 --> 00:28:27,719
beautiful plant it's interesting you

700
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:30,200
mentioned the product uh trials with

701
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:33,038
specific specific audiences because you

702
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:35,919
know um I have a classical education in

703
00:28:33,038 --> 00:28:38,919
Academia so I I presented a lot of

704
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:42,399
non-cannabis conferences and one of the

705
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:44,720
most interesting conferences I uh talk

706
00:28:42,398 --> 00:28:48,319
at is called the food flavor and

707
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:50,079
fragrance uh conference and when you're

708
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:52,278
trying to figure out what potato is best

709
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:54,720
for a french fry or what Tomatoes best

710
00:28:52,278 --> 00:28:56,640
for tomato sauce you actually have to

711
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,839
segregate your populations because some

712
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,600
people don't have a certain type of

713
00:28:58,839 --> 00:29:03,639
taste bud so they can't taste a certain

714
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:05,798
flavor and so when you're creating your

715
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:07,240
demographic your target audience you

716
00:29:05,798 --> 00:29:09,679
have to break them apart and use

717
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:11,960
different um products to see which ones

718
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:14,080
they like and then actually create a

719
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:16,079
prog product that is targeted to a

720
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:19,398
specific audience and that that's

721
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:22,079
exactly what the Innovations in behind

722
00:29:19,398 --> 00:29:24,359
enhanced or type two flowers are um our

723
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:25,639
group calls them enhanced because when

724
00:29:24,359 --> 00:29:28,240
you get to the store level and the

725
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:30,559
consumer level they love them but but

726
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,599
when you say hey type two they kind of

727
00:29:30,558 --> 00:29:35,158
get lost but when you say enhanced it's

728
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:37,519
like enhanced with CBD or whatever it

729
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:39,960
sounds a little bit more um palatable on

730
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:41,720
the consumer tone you know I kind of

731
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:44,319
want to go down the rabbit hole of that

732
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:47,038
anxiety experience because I have always

733
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:49,038
smoked type one like dabbed large rips

734
00:29:47,038 --> 00:29:51,200
you know had a high tolerance you know

735
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:53,440
the first time I ever met Sam I'm quite

736
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,600
certain he was trying to kill me uh and

737
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,759
he didn't and I survived and it's almost

738
00:29:55,599 --> 00:30:00,678
what bonded our friendship I remember

739
00:29:57,759 --> 00:30:02,200
the next day when he smoked a bowl with

740
00:30:00,679 --> 00:30:03,919
someone at the Cannabis Cup and knocked

741
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,360
them unconscious and then they got up

742
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:07,640
and they had been sharing a booth with

743
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:09,918
me uh the guy was working for hemp

744
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:12,038
employed uh and he said oh I want you to

745
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:13,759
do that to him and he was pointing to me

746
00:30:12,038 --> 00:30:15,759
and Sam was like yeah yeah that's not

747
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:17,240
going to happen to him sort of thing and

748
00:30:15,759 --> 00:30:19,119
you know it wasn't until my father was

749
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:21,798
killed in a motorcycle accident with his

750
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:24,479
wife U my stepmother um on a motorcycle

751
00:30:21,798 --> 00:30:26,720
I purchased him for his 50th birthday

752
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,720
that I had this sort of trauma and

753
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:32,159
stress that occurred in my body that had

754
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:34,798
never occurred before in my life and

755
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:36,919
cannabis high THC in particular seemed

756
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:38,639
to bring it up to the surface and I I

757
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:40,159
can't say it was a bad thing because I

758
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,480
think it's how I worked through that

759
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:44,960
anxiety and stress I pulled it out I

760
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,599
experienced it I held it and I

761
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:50,079
transformed it uh and it took years I'll

762
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:52,079
be honest um it happened again years

763
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:54,439
later when I was in a very bad dirt bike

764
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:56,439
accident of my own and I absolutely

765
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:59,000
crushed my lower back I mean I was

766
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:01,600
walking you know like like like a like a

767
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,960
baby for about three and a half months I

768
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:06,439
still have pain four years later I go

769
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:09,079
see an IMS guy all the time and you know

770
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:11,720
when it flares up I and I'll take that

771
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:14,759
what really high THC particularly High

772
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:17,480
terpinolene narrowleaf drug cultivar

773
00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:19,158
that it almost flares up that pain and

774
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:21,159
and and and creates these sorts of

775
00:31:19,159 --> 00:31:22,679
anxiety attacks now for me I've sort of

776
00:31:21,159 --> 00:31:24,200
worked through those as well and I've

777
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:27,080
gotten back to that place where I can

778
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:29,038
really enjoy a big dab but those were

779
00:31:27,079 --> 00:31:31,798
two instances in my life where I was

780
00:31:29,038 --> 00:31:34,398
unable to take big dabs uh even in my

781
00:31:31,798 --> 00:31:36,278
YouTube videos you know I'll I'll do the

782
00:31:34,398 --> 00:31:38,199
video where I did the the rosin press

783
00:31:36,278 --> 00:31:39,960
it's got almost five million views on it

784
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:42,080
and I took a half pound and I ran it

785
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:43,679
through the pure pressure and at the end

786
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:45,720
I take a little dab there's probably a

787
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:47,519
hundred people on there that comment on

788
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:49,880
the small size of the dab that I took

789
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:51,960
well the cultivar was where is my bike

790
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:54,080
and where is my bike is a biker cush

791
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:56,639
crossed with an Amnesia Haze so it's

792
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:58,759
extremely high in terpinolene and it's a

793
00:31:56,638 --> 00:32:00,599
very strong cultivar that gives people

794
00:31:58,759 --> 00:32:03,158
anxiety attacks and I wonder if we could

795
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:05,599
get into that what is the psychology of

796
00:32:03,159 --> 00:32:08,159
that are we pulling up stress to

797
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:09,678
transform it is it you know like is it

798
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:12,360
finding something that's there that

799
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:14,080
needs to be processed or are we just at

800
00:32:12,359 --> 00:32:16,918
a point in our lives where we need to

801
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:19,918
look at maybe some of the type two uh

802
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:22,960
and and and type three plants I can

803
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:26,679
speak to the chemistry if you want

804
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:28,440
I terpinolene is basically a structural

805
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:30,600
isomer with lyine

806
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:32,278
and on the phytx terpinolene is red

807
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:34,278
because of that exact reason it's like

808
00:32:32,278 --> 00:32:37,519
one of the most sativa it gives you the

809
00:32:34,278 --> 00:32:40,839
most sativa like effects right lyine is

810
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:42,000
also um a stimulant and anti-depressant

811
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:44,079
the only difference between the two

812
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,919
molecules is the location of the double

813
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:49,558
bond and the first time I ever smoked a

814
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:52,759
tpine cultivar was train wreck in Santa

815
00:32:49,558 --> 00:32:55,480
Barbara and some dude's house who he

816
00:32:52,759 --> 00:32:57,558
slept on the couch and every bedroom had

817
00:32:55,480 --> 00:33:00,038
black and white paper being sucked in

818
00:32:57,558 --> 00:33:01,960
from all the carbon filters and I had

819
00:33:00,038 --> 00:33:03,679
the same experience Marcus was

820
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:05,480
describing with David where I was like

821
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:07,200
oh [ __ ] I'm he's setting me up

822
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:09,159
somebody's coming to bust me right now

823
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:12,440
and and was like then after that we

824
00:33:09,159 --> 00:33:15,480
super bonded and it was the research we

825
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:18,880
did with the type two terpinolene

826
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:23,798
cultivars where we noticed in the blind

827
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:26,320
study that as you added CBD to THC the

828
00:33:23,798 --> 00:33:28,638
tpine uh the tpine Entourage effect

829
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:31,079
became more apparent

830
00:33:28,638 --> 00:33:33,000
so you know people would feel that

831
00:33:31,079 --> 00:33:35,519
stimulating effect and we also used to

832
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,079
just take tpin and put them on the

833
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:41,240
volcano and inhale them and see how they

834
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:43,480
made us feel right and terpinolene and

835
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:44,960
and it sometimes made things sparkly and

836
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:47,120
definitely increased your heart rate

837
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:49,278
like with loning make you talk a little

838
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:51,638
faster that's kind of the background on

839
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:52,759
that thanks Mark Sam you had something

840
00:33:51,638 --> 00:33:56,759
to

841
00:33:52,759 --> 00:33:58,440
say yeah but I'm spaced out and I forgot

842
00:33:56,759 --> 00:34:01,599
we were talking about anx xiety and

843
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:04,080
stress and uh you know in inducing those

844
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:07,199
things when they're deep down no I was

845
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:10,759
just going to say that a lot of times

846
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:14,480
it's fear of like with psychedelics it's

847
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:17,440
fear of the fear that pushes people

848
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:20,240
really over the edge when they've uh

849
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:22,878
smoke too much for themselves if they

850
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:27,118
just relax let go and don't worry about

851
00:34:22,878 --> 00:34:30,039
it they're actually fine yeah we know we

852
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:32,919
know from DC is anagenic Right which

853
00:34:30,039 --> 00:34:34,838
just means that it it promotes

854
00:34:32,918 --> 00:34:36,638
anxiety but there's you know on the

855
00:34:34,838 --> 00:34:38,559
terpinene front there's definitely

856
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:40,760
something there because I mean that's

857
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:43,199
kind of been anecdotal about those

858
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:45,919
Amnesia hazes and that that class of

859
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:47,878
weed um for years people have said that

860
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:49,319
you know it kind of makes them squirly

861
00:34:47,878 --> 00:34:51,838
so there there might actually be

862
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:53,240
something to that um I think something

863
00:34:51,838 --> 00:34:55,159
that maybe wasn't totally clear when

864
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:57,239
Mark was describing the ratios and the

865
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:59,760
typ twos when we started doing all these

866
00:34:57,239 --> 00:35:02,679
crosses and and making these original

867
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:04,839
type two lines um from unstabilized

868
00:35:02,679 --> 00:35:07,598
parents we realized that there was

869
00:35:04,838 --> 00:35:09,239
different plants um that would that

870
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:12,200
would essentially spit different ratios

871
00:35:09,239 --> 00:35:14,319
of canabo in The Offspring so we had you

872
00:35:12,199 --> 00:35:17,000
know the first ones to come out or like

873
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:19,160
the like Mark was saying the one to tws

874
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,519
the one to ones and then the two to ones

875
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:23,960
we always put THC first because it's you

876
00:35:22,519 --> 00:35:26,119
know in the ratio just because it's easy

877
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:27,280
to understand most people it's the it's

878
00:35:26,119 --> 00:35:29,400
the it's the number most people are

879
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:31,599
looking at

880
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:33,920
um but after breeding and creating par

881
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:36,280
parental lines that would make each of

882
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:39,240
those crosses and and doing some kind of

883
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:41,400
nifty breeding tricks in between the the

884
00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:44,719
types we actually found that there was

885
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:49,400
plants that were like 4 to one THC to

886
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:52,679
CBD and and 8 to1 um THC to CB or sorry

887
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:55,160
THC to CBD and those numbers aren't

888
00:35:52,679 --> 00:35:56,639
really like those those plants you have

889
00:35:55,159 --> 00:35:58,078
to do special breeding tricks to pull

890
00:35:56,639 --> 00:36:02,838
them out like they're not just floating

891
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:04,599
around the drug the the marketplace okay

892
00:36:02,838 --> 00:36:06,838
um and we started to realize when you

893
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:09,240
have those different ratios of THC and

894
00:36:06,838 --> 00:36:11,039
CBD really the different it's like you

895
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:12,639
have a total THC with a little bit of a

896
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:15,440
CBD buffer I think is what we were

897
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:17,239
calling it at first it really changes it

898
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,760
takes a lot of the edge off of that

899
00:36:17,239 --> 00:36:22,118
anxiety from the

900
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:23,200
THC um which for some people it's just

901
00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:24,599
too much you know there's a whole

902
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:26,838
segment of the popul I know everybody

903
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:28,160
likes to do these massive dabs and get

904
00:36:26,838 --> 00:36:29,920
as high as you can but when you're you

905
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:32,118
know when you're using cannabis for

906
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,039
medicine um and you you don't come from

907
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:36,119
that world where you're just trying to

908
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:37,679
get blitzed all the time there are

909
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:39,599
adverse you know some of these these

910
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:42,480
anxiety effects that you have with THC

911
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:44,559
are kind of like adverse right it's not

912
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,119
it's not ideal for Mom to be getting way

913
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:47,519
too high to the point where she doesn't

914
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:49,400
want to use the medicine right because

915
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:50,719
you lose the benefit you lose the

916
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:52,760
medical benefit if you're getting too

917
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:56,559
high you're scaring people away from the

918
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:58,359
medicine um and so having these you know

919
00:36:56,559 --> 00:37:00,519
we what we we realize is that having

920
00:36:58,358 --> 00:37:03,519
these these kind of different levels of

921
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:05,639
CBD buffer it kind of takes the edge off

922
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:07,519
the THC for a whole different group of

923
00:37:05,639 --> 00:37:11,000
people

924
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:13,559
um type in the market you know could

925
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,599
that be could that be action on on

926
00:37:13,559 --> 00:37:18,078
dopamine

927
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:21,599
release I I because I I I I I think CBD

928
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:24,599
is different than THC isn't it in

929
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:26,680
dopamine the man when we're talking

930
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:28,000
about these kind of things it's for me

931
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:29,239
it's like you know I I studied

932
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,358
Neuroscience in

933
00:37:29,239 --> 00:37:34,239
University um and after coming out of

934
00:37:32,358 --> 00:37:36,719
that process I kind of my feeling on the

935
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:39,118
brain is that we're still just pushing

936
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:41,279
buttons right like what does this lever

937
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:43,119
do kind of thing it's because they're

938
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:45,240
such complicated hair balls right it's

939
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:47,440
like THC interacts with dopamine which

940
00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:49,239
cross talks with norepinephrine which

941
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:52,039
you know impacts the opioid system and

942
00:37:49,239 --> 00:37:54,559
serotonin to say conclusively that X

943
00:37:52,039 --> 00:37:56,440
does y is really really difficult

944
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:57,880
especially when we're you know we're

945
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,760
we're essentially just specul it

946
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:01,760
mechanism and we find what we find a new

947
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,680
receptor every month or well not

948
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:05,599
literally but kind of and I think it's

949
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:07,440
going to have to be big data that ever

950
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:09,720
figures it out no human's gonna figure

951
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:12,440
it out it's gonna be big blue or

952
00:38:09,719 --> 00:38:13,959
whatever on an individual basis it's

953
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:15,880
really important to remember every

954
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:17,519
person's endoc canono system is

955
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:19,160
different and their need for this

956
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:21,920
cannabis chemistry

957
00:38:19,159 --> 00:38:24,399
differs I love the idea of building data

958
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:28,440
sets so we can sort of generalize more

959
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:30,920
fully but yeah um our bodies are not

960
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:33,639
single molecule systems and and the

961
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:36,240
plant is not single molecule so it's

962
00:38:33,639 --> 00:38:39,719
really I love that image of a hairball

963
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:41,598
of of things going on in the body it's a

964
00:38:39,719 --> 00:38:43,000
big knot it's like a big yarn knot right

965
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:44,400
like how do you tease that whole thing

966
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,800
apart when you're trying to understand

967
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:50,318
the the bits at play and you know we we

968
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:51,640
exist in a system where you know a

969
00:38:50,318 --> 00:38:53,639
doctor doesn't like the idea of having

970
00:38:51,639 --> 00:38:54,920
to try you on T 10 different drugs

971
00:38:53,639 --> 00:38:56,960
before they figure out which one works

972
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:58,960
they want to say oh you're this type we

973
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:01,440
need to give this type of drug and we're

974
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:04,240
just not at that point in time yet but

975
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:07,920
um the you know the range of type two

976
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:09,399
plants that we now have and I assume

977
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,960
Mark that you've continued to put those

978
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:13,400
canono ratios into all the different

979
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:15,199
flavor PL profiles it's like you're

980
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:17,440
essentially creating a spectrum of

981
00:39:15,199 --> 00:39:20,519
plants that people can then you know

982
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:21,838
choose from and and really you know

983
00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:24,079
sounds lame but it's like Choose Your

984
00:39:21,838 --> 00:39:27,039
Own Adventure right like you can dial

985
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:29,240
the the the experience into the user

986
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:31,639
when you have all these different types

987
00:39:29,239 --> 00:39:33,879
yeah um just for a second Ryan one of

988
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:36,199
the product lines out here that these

989
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:39,800
technologies have gone into is called

990
00:39:36,199 --> 00:39:42,239
special and it's uh it basically is a

991
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:46,079
like a lemon crush or a really gassy OG

992
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:49,559
nose and there is a low THC version a

993
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:53,200
one:1 version and a high THC version the

994
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:55,799
1.5 to1 version uh is is on the market

995
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:58,318
as well so it's basically all the the

996
00:39:55,800 --> 00:40:01,519
flavors of a gassy OG

997
00:39:58,318 --> 00:40:03,559
and the the the THC to CBD ratios cross

998
00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:05,639
the whole spectrum and you know you

999
00:40:03,559 --> 00:40:08,639
mentioned you know all the people on the

1000
00:40:05,639 --> 00:40:10,639
show or or big dabbers or whatever but

1001
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:14,358
we have consumers that once we turn them

1002
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:16,759
on to an enhanced or like a one: one or

1003
00:40:14,358 --> 00:40:19,199
a two to one dab that's how they start

1004
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:21,440
the day and they find and even in the

1005
00:40:19,199 --> 00:40:23,960
surveys show that they feel like they

1006
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:26,280
get higher at night when they use their

1007
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:28,720
type one again so it's almost like you

1008
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:30,880
look at the science and mcpartland and

1009
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:32,959
the study out of Australia it it's like

1010
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:35,358
you you have this endocannabinoid tone

1011
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:37,679
or health that you're trying to maintain

1012
00:40:35,358 --> 00:40:41,000
and if you're constantly banging a large

1013
00:40:37,679 --> 00:40:43,199
signal of 80% THC your body actually

1014
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:46,239
changes and you start downregulating

1015
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:49,199
receptors so not only is your ball of

1016
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:51,399
yarn or hairball complex to tease out

1017
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:54,199
it's constantly changing and rewrapping

1018
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:56,960
itself so if you if you're a heavy user

1019
00:40:54,199 --> 00:40:59,279
of THC I'd just urge you to just try it

1020
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:01,960
a couple couple times in the morning

1021
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:03,960
some coffee and then then go back to

1022
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:05,880
your high THC and you'll find that it's

1023
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:08,159
actually that's perfect it's like a

1024
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:11,920
great thing that's that's actually how I

1025
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:15,239
use now it's you know perfect yes yes

1026
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:16,920
yes I wanted sorry and also there's

1027
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:18,679
something about what Marcus brought up

1028
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:20,480
as the intro this that I really wanted

1029
00:41:18,679 --> 00:41:23,598
to catch that I love um there's a

1030
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:26,119
psychological perspective about anxiety

1031
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:28,440
different than biochemical I think about

1032
00:41:26,119 --> 00:41:30,480
the role of anxiety um and this is my

1033
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:33,880
background I went my graduate degree was

1034
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:36,159
at Pacifica I was really a Yan but the

1035
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:39,358
reality is I think about the ego

1036
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:40,960
distonic experience and the way in which

1037
00:41:39,358 --> 00:41:43,480
one of the things Universal to

1038
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:46,800
psychedelics is that you must have this

1039
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:49,679
ego distonic moment in order to have the

1040
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:52,440
opportunity to leave behind a lot of the

1041
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:55,199
baggage and complexity of this kind of

1042
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:57,240
last awareness to be very very present I

1043
00:41:55,199 --> 00:42:00,159
think about fear as Sam brought up and

1044
00:41:57,239 --> 00:42:02,759
the kind of low-laying a latent anxiety

1045
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:04,759
like modern living disease and the way

1046
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:07,119
in which you know most of us throughout

1047
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:09,440
varying levels of stress that would

1048
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:12,119
surpass what other humans and other

1049
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:14,039
Generations may have even uh possibly

1050
00:42:12,119 --> 00:42:16,039
conceived of that there is a a

1051
00:42:14,039 --> 00:42:17,639
fundamental stress Baseline that I think

1052
00:42:16,039 --> 00:42:19,519
is quite high you can look at

1053
00:42:17,639 --> 00:42:21,199
epinephrine and biochemistry and stuff

1054
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:23,119
but the bottom line is I think we're

1055
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:25,399
primarily producing cortisol throughout

1056
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:26,920
the day most of the time I actually did

1057
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:29,400
a trial at one point where I had heart

1058
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:31,318
rate monitoring and I was really working

1059
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:34,200
to understand at what point I could

1060
00:42:31,318 --> 00:42:36,880
reduce cortisol production I could not

1061
00:42:34,199 --> 00:42:39,399
even get to that state in a sitting

1062
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:41,800
meditating position the only way I could

1063
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:44,079
achieve it was in a slow walking

1064
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:46,240
meditation following really slow

1065
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:48,559
breathing and eventually I got there and

1066
00:42:46,239 --> 00:42:50,919
then realized we're basically on these

1067
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:53,079
really hard drugs so much of the time

1068
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:55,159
and this of course is very damaging but

1069
00:42:53,079 --> 00:42:57,359
again back to the anxiety I feel there's

1070
00:42:55,159 --> 00:43:00,039
like Marcus was saying an invitation

1071
00:42:57,358 --> 00:43:02,000
towards an opportunity to be present and

1072
00:43:00,039 --> 00:43:04,759
to filter some of the fear and the

1073
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,880
latent trauma and the experiences that

1074
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:08,720
hopefully do get cleared so I think

1075
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:10,640
there's a really like I've always been a

1076
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:11,959
pretty high anxiety person I think

1077
00:43:10,639 --> 00:43:13,719
that's one of the things that's drawn me

1078
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:16,280
to cannabis in general but I've been

1079
00:43:13,719 --> 00:43:18,519
able to mitigate the worst expressions

1080
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:20,480
of that and be high functioning by

1081
00:43:18,519 --> 00:43:23,079
virtue in part and especially in the

1082
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:24,838
last eight years or so with type twos

1083
00:43:23,079 --> 00:43:26,480
I'm excited about what that represents

1084
00:43:24,838 --> 00:43:28,558
and that also one other thing you said

1085
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:31,480
Mark just this notion that I actually

1086
00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:33,440
get I I really enjoy my type 1 highs

1087
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:35,358
more there's a dimensionality there's

1088
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:37,599
something it's punctuated when I get

1089
00:43:35,358 --> 00:43:40,039
into a Groove where I'm on type one a

1090
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:43,200
whole bunch throughout many many days it

1091
00:43:40,039 --> 00:43:45,800
it's just it it flattens out I'm missing

1092
00:43:43,199 --> 00:43:48,199
nuance and depth and dimension it's that

1093
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:50,200
it's opening up this much bigger space

1094
00:43:48,199 --> 00:43:53,199
so I I really love that diverse endoc

1095
00:43:50,199 --> 00:43:55,519
canabo diet to accommodate also diverse

1096
00:43:53,199 --> 00:43:57,960
endoc canabo tone I just think it's such

1097
00:43:55,519 --> 00:44:01,239
a a cool Direction you know one thing

1098
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:04,159
more I'll oh go ahead Kelly hi everybody

1099
00:44:01,239 --> 00:44:06,279
um and welcome oh thank you so much it's

1100
00:44:04,159 --> 00:44:08,558
so nice to be here the conversation is

1101
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:10,519
super important and and really awesome

1102
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:12,160
um I just think that when we're talking

1103
00:44:10,519 --> 00:44:14,318
about cannabis and we're talking about

1104
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:16,598
analogic effects of cannabis I think

1105
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:19,039
that it's really important that we don't

1106
00:44:16,599 --> 00:44:22,079
forget that this is a conscious

1107
00:44:19,039 --> 00:44:24,599
changing uh plant this is not

1108
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:27,559
necessarily A symptomatic plant this

1109
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:30,039
plant can get to the root of things

1110
00:44:27,559 --> 00:44:32,920
very quickly so when we're talking about

1111
00:44:30,039 --> 00:44:35,159
analgesics we need to also delve into

1112
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:37,599
the analgesics of the emotions of the

1113
00:44:35,159 --> 00:44:41,480
mind that this plant is not just going

1114
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:44,480
to hit some type of a symptomatic effect

1115
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:47,639
it's going to go way deep into the root

1116
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:51,039
so when people consume this they're

1117
00:44:47,639 --> 00:44:53,799
going to be maybe uplifting a tremendous

1118
00:44:51,039 --> 00:44:56,838
amount of past emotions because they're

1119
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:59,559
not just dealing with the symptoms and

1120
00:44:56,838 --> 00:45:01,558
this where plants are so different than

1121
00:44:59,559 --> 00:45:04,119
Pharmaceuticals because Pharmaceuticals

1122
00:45:01,559 --> 00:45:06,800
are so incredibly symptomatic you take

1123
00:45:04,119 --> 00:45:08,480
it it deals with a symptom but when we

1124
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:10,160
smoke cannabis or when we ingest

1125
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:12,440
cannabis or even when we use it

1126
00:45:10,159 --> 00:45:15,199
topically it's going to be going to the

1127
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:16,960
root it's going to be attacking it's

1128
00:45:15,199 --> 00:45:20,159
going to be breaking

1129
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:22,639
down those subconscious layers that we

1130
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:24,558
have that hold us back from our ultimate

1131
00:45:22,639 --> 00:45:26,358
healing and that's where we're talking

1132
00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:30,200
about fear we're talking about all these

1133
00:45:26,358 --> 00:45:33,279
things because we also have pain is

1134
00:45:30,199 --> 00:45:35,078
associated with emotional ties just like

1135
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:37,760
you were saying Marcus you know when you

1136
00:45:35,079 --> 00:45:40,640
hurt your back that there's so much

1137
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:44,839
emotions that are tied into that like we

1138
00:45:40,639 --> 00:45:47,960
have symptoms upon immediate effect of

1139
00:45:44,838 --> 00:45:50,480
some type of an injury and then when we

1140
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:53,318
ingest cannabis it brings it all up to

1141
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:55,480
the surface so in talking about the

1142
00:45:53,318 --> 00:45:57,519
scientific measures of it in talking

1143
00:45:55,480 --> 00:46:00,318
about the cannabinoids

1144
00:45:57,519 --> 00:46:02,159
there's this whole unknown that comes

1145
00:46:00,318 --> 00:46:03,838
into play Maybe Jeremy you were talking

1146
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:06,399
about it as the ego and I'd like to go

1147
00:46:03,838 --> 00:46:09,358
even deeper than the egoo this is our

1148
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:11,079
ultimate you know bodily function that

1149
00:46:09,358 --> 00:46:14,480
we have and how we're dealing and of

1150
00:46:11,079 --> 00:46:16,760
course cortisol is a huge player to this

1151
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:20,559
so when people are ingesting it's like

1152
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:22,960
they have to un how many layers of onion

1153
00:46:20,559 --> 00:46:26,160
you know do you have to be able to get

1154
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:28,599
to the center of dealing with the issue

1155
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:31,000
that you're trying to get to and I find

1156
00:46:28,599 --> 00:46:33,720
that in dealing with patients you know

1157
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:36,159
I'll be treating a knee injury and then

1158
00:46:33,719 --> 00:46:38,598
one month later wow we really were

1159
00:46:36,159 --> 00:46:41,558
dealing with some massive childhood

1160
00:46:38,599 --> 00:46:43,838
trauma that the plant brought up all of

1161
00:46:41,559 --> 00:46:46,720
these different symptoms and then that

1162
00:46:43,838 --> 00:46:49,039
was what healed the knee so I think that

1163
00:46:46,719 --> 00:46:51,639
if we pull more away from symptomatic

1164
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:54,639
healing which was what alpath and which

1165
00:46:51,639 --> 00:46:56,960
is what w Western medicine has shown us

1166
00:46:54,639 --> 00:46:59,679
then we will be aligning with the true

1167
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:04,039
healing nature of this plant which is to

1168
00:46:59,679 --> 00:47:06,759
bring science and bring ex uh um

1169
00:47:04,039 --> 00:47:09,920
observational experience to bring

1170
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:13,000
emotional experience and not

1171
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:16,280
differentiate when we talk about um pain

1172
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:19,039
and healing that we don't differentiate

1173
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:21,200
the physical pain and healing with the

1174
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:23,079
emotional pain and healing because they

1175
00:47:21,199 --> 00:47:25,239
are all one and the plant continues to

1176
00:47:23,079 --> 00:47:27,839
show us that I would just add that you

1177
00:47:25,239 --> 00:47:31,000
know our disposition of our microbiome

1178
00:47:27,838 --> 00:47:32,599
affects our endocannabinoid system so

1179
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:35,079
health and well-being through food is

1180
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:40,400
going to affect the Cannabis as it comes

1181
00:47:35,079 --> 00:47:43,760
in also toxicity in the plant can often

1182
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:45,519
create anxiety in the person and we know

1183
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:47,200
often we've met people and and have

1184
00:47:45,519 --> 00:47:49,318
close family members with you know that

1185
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:52,598
have gone through hyper Mesa syndrome or

1186
00:47:49,318 --> 00:47:55,719
or or or anxiety with cannabis and they

1187
00:47:52,599 --> 00:47:57,440
will smoke a regeneratively grown

1188
00:47:55,719 --> 00:47:59,959
organic flour

1189
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:02,079
and it will not give them the same

1190
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:04,400
effects so we are dealing with toxic

1191
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:06,640
overloads it's very important for us to

1192
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:08,358
detox ourselves so that this medicine

1193
00:48:06,639 --> 00:48:10,199
can be so powerful we love and

1194
00:48:08,358 --> 00:48:12,119
appreciate and I just I'm sorry just to

1195
00:48:10,199 --> 00:48:14,519
jump on it one more time I believe that

1196
00:48:12,119 --> 00:48:16,240
when we talk a lot about the science and

1197
00:48:14,519 --> 00:48:18,280
we're pushing a lot about the

1198
00:48:16,239 --> 00:48:21,358
cannabinoids that we really need to

1199
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:25,160
almost step back a little bit and we

1200
00:48:21,358 --> 00:48:27,799
need to not ask more of the plant than

1201
00:48:25,159 --> 00:48:29,920
what she can offer I believe that this

1202
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:32,599
new time and this new outcoming this

1203
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:35,838
plant is having you know an outcoming

1204
00:48:32,599 --> 00:48:38,760
from a time of victimization of of being

1205
00:48:35,838 --> 00:48:41,759
shrouded and and we're asking so much of

1206
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:45,680
her and we're trying to come to like all

1207
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:47,720
of these finite answers and magical

1208
00:48:45,679 --> 00:48:51,960
remedies without letting her just sort

1209
00:48:47,719 --> 00:48:54,118
of unravel and show herself and and and

1210
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:56,400
watch the experience that we're all

1211
00:48:54,119 --> 00:48:59,680
having with this plant rather than

1212
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:01,798
trying to come to definitive definitions

1213
00:48:59,679 --> 00:49:06,078
of it right away because each person is

1214
00:49:01,798 --> 00:49:09,318
having such a differential experiential

1215
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:11,760
effect could agree more with that I mean

1216
00:49:09,318 --> 00:49:15,480
when we do our panels one of the things

1217
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:18,160
we notice is that um it's it's not just

1218
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:21,039
a high it's a behavioral distinct change

1219
00:49:18,159 --> 00:49:23,279
things taste better things feel better

1220
00:49:21,039 --> 00:49:25,159
you're more intuitive so there is

1221
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:27,160
definitely a spiritual component and

1222
00:49:25,159 --> 00:49:30,558
what's beautiful about chemistry is that

1223
00:49:27,159 --> 00:49:32,399
you can take a dive into everything that

1224
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:34,359
I mean you can look at thousands of

1225
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:36,838
compounds that are in this plant I mean

1226
00:49:34,358 --> 00:49:39,199
you can dig down to the the heavy metals

1227
00:49:36,838 --> 00:49:42,440
the flavonoids the tpin and and then you

1228
00:49:39,199 --> 00:49:44,719
can cross-compare and analyze and have a

1229
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:46,559
whole panel where people discuss you

1230
00:49:44,719 --> 00:49:49,558
know it changes the flavor of salts to

1231
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:51,480
some it makes sweets sweeter to others

1232
00:49:49,559 --> 00:49:53,760
and it ties right back into what Rafi

1233
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:56,880
mulam says where he thinks that the you

1234
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:59,559
know indoc canabo system has a major

1235
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:04,838
contribution to your your personality

1236
00:49:59,559 --> 00:50:04,839
right Ryan I mean that one of his famous

1237
00:50:06,679 --> 00:50:11,719
sayings yeah there's another uh thing

1238
00:50:09,199 --> 00:50:14,239
that we would be remiss to uh bring up

1239
00:50:11,719 --> 00:50:16,358
if as move is not with us today and you

1240
00:50:14,239 --> 00:50:18,199
know Mojave has a variety that he's

1241
00:50:16,358 --> 00:50:20,838
worked with for a very long time called

1242
00:50:18,199 --> 00:50:23,358
Zeta it's a terpinolene Dom variety it

1243
00:50:20,838 --> 00:50:25,039
reminds me a bit of zel's gift actually

1244
00:50:23,358 --> 00:50:27,798
which I love that plant she's so

1245
00:50:25,039 --> 00:50:30,960
beautiful I uh but that I think of

1246
00:50:27,798 --> 00:50:33,480
Mojave reminiscing about moderate THC

1247
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:36,199
combined with terpinolene as this

1248
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:39,159
spiritual plant from Big Sur and and

1249
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:41,118
this population at the root of that kind

1250
00:50:39,159 --> 00:50:44,039
of moment in time was the most

1251
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:45,358
sought-after and and spiritual cannabis

1252
00:50:44,039 --> 00:50:47,558
I just think it's fascinating though

1253
00:50:45,358 --> 00:50:51,358
that that was again probably like 10 to

1254
00:50:47,559 --> 00:50:53,200
15% THC and turpening da and I think

1255
00:50:51,358 --> 00:50:56,000
that's a that's a really beautiful

1256
00:50:53,199 --> 00:50:58,279
profile and and hey this is Colin this

1257
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,880
is Al also touching on on a conversation

1258
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:02,200
we had the other day which was you know

1259
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:06,519
the physiological and the the the sense

1260
00:51:02,199 --> 00:51:09,399
of of memory tied to uh the different

1261
00:51:06,519 --> 00:51:11,679
tpine profiles or chemical profiles I

1262
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:14,440
think there's a lineage directly

1263
00:51:11,679 --> 00:51:18,399
correlated to those things and and how

1264
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:20,240
we're associating our personal uh you

1265
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:23,318
know opinions of what is good and what

1266
00:51:20,239 --> 00:51:25,358
is bad um and over the years you know

1267
00:51:23,318 --> 00:51:27,719
trinoline I think has been a dominant in

1268
00:51:25,358 --> 00:51:29,598
terms of everyone's profile and I think

1269
00:51:27,719 --> 00:51:31,798
there's there's no mistake over that

1270
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:34,318
there there's definitely some memory uh

1271
00:51:31,798 --> 00:51:36,400
sensories uh you know being evoked in

1272
00:51:34,318 --> 00:51:39,000
things in you know in our bodies and in

1273
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:40,880
our minds and I think that's uh also the

1274
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,280
the connection that that happens with

1275
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:44,920
with all these different chemicals is

1276
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:46,920
the the sensory of memory and how that

1277
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:49,519
uh brings us into into

1278
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:51,480
now yeah and I believe one of our trials

1279
00:51:49,519 --> 00:51:53,838
also showed that you know you add a

1280
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:56,760
little bit of CBD and it actually helps

1281
00:51:53,838 --> 00:51:59,039
with the memory loss issue um so there

1282
00:51:56,760 --> 00:52:00,760
definitely formulations for that and you

1283
00:51:59,039 --> 00:52:03,079
know that's why we like to call the the

1284
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:05,240
type twos enhanced because we feel like

1285
00:52:03,079 --> 00:52:07,200
they can enhance every aspect of your

1286
00:52:05,239 --> 00:52:08,919
life whether it's you know waking up in

1287
00:52:07,199 --> 00:52:12,000
the morning being creative going on a

1288
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:15,760
run or partying down it's like there's

1289
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:18,599
there's this ability to find a chemical

1290
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:21,480
mixture cocktail that's going to improve

1291
00:52:18,599 --> 00:52:23,400
your life and you know what in the world

1292
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:26,159
isn't chemistry you

1293
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:28,200
know yeah you know also I've noticed

1294
00:52:26,159 --> 00:52:30,759
that a little little uh splash of that

1295
00:52:28,199 --> 00:52:34,318
CBD and working with patients over the

1296
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:37,319
years and then really fiting our oneto

1297
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:40,199
one I really am believing that that

1298
00:52:37,318 --> 00:52:44,159
splash of CBD is what brings those

1299
00:52:40,199 --> 00:52:48,879
cortisol levels down which

1300
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:48,879
helps you know have

1301
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:58,318
aiz of what is actually going on where

1302
00:52:55,358 --> 00:53:00,920
it that

1303
00:52:58,318 --> 00:53:03,239
weers you know need to focus think that

1304
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:05,000
that CD brings it down just and realize

1305
00:53:03,239 --> 00:53:07,118
where the medicine needs to go also

1306
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:10,079
something that we're not talking about

1307
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:13,400
here is that in working with patients

1308
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:16,318
there's an incredible intrical um almost

1309
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:20,119
electric energy that's going on when a

1310
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:23,719
person is ingesting cannabis it's so

1311
00:53:20,119 --> 00:53:27,400
it's it's it's so experiential it's so

1312
00:53:23,719 --> 00:53:29,798
incredibly personal that almost to

1313
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:32,639
have a

1314
00:53:29,798 --> 00:53:34,679
relationship with the person that is

1315
00:53:32,639 --> 00:53:36,519
offering the medicine to you or Dr Lis

1316
00:53:34,679 --> 00:53:39,440
you know you're talking about having

1317
00:53:36,519 --> 00:53:41,679
patient studies having these patient

1318
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:44,358
studies that are more intimate and more

1319
00:53:41,679 --> 00:53:47,399
involved I'm finding we really get to

1320
00:53:44,358 --> 00:53:50,558
the root of things much faster which is

1321
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:52,798
again not an alpath model it's following

1322
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:55,200
something a little bit more different a

1323
00:53:52,798 --> 00:53:57,039
little bit more natural and following

1324
00:53:55,199 --> 00:53:59,199
more about what the plan

1325
00:53:57,039 --> 00:54:00,960
and Kelly there's a wonderful piece uh

1326
00:53:59,199 --> 00:54:03,118
there with

1327
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:05,199
psychopharmacology there's this whole

1328
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:08,039
body of research that illustrates say

1329
00:54:05,199 --> 00:54:10,159
you give somebody an SSRI and they have

1330
00:54:08,039 --> 00:54:12,519
depressive features you'll actually find

1331
00:54:10,159 --> 00:54:14,798
statistically over time very often that

1332
00:54:12,519 --> 00:54:17,239
will not benefit the person at all but

1333
00:54:14,798 --> 00:54:19,318
if you pair that with counseling now you

1334
00:54:17,239 --> 00:54:22,078
have this unbelievable opportunity so

1335
00:54:19,318 --> 00:54:23,920
it's a relational element that I feel is

1336
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:26,000
often missing in our therapeutic

1337
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:28,639
conversation I've approached that in a

1338
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:30,318
way the Pharma counter that I got to

1339
00:54:28,639 --> 00:54:32,480
experiment with a huge community of

1340
00:54:30,318 --> 00:54:34,480
patients where it always felt like when

1341
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:36,599
people were new to cannabis there was

1342
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:39,240
this simple orientation to here's an

1343
00:54:36,599 --> 00:54:41,400
array of phytochemical profiles but you

1344
00:54:39,239 --> 00:54:43,919
know don't attach too much value to that

1345
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:45,680
but at least have some association with

1346
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:47,760
what s of different profiles you're

1347
00:54:45,679 --> 00:54:49,838
consuming but then you know titration

1348
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:52,040
and dosage start with these tiny

1349
00:54:49,838 --> 00:54:53,679
increments and really get to know those

1350
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:55,440
different increments at different times

1351
00:54:53,679 --> 00:54:57,000
and then let's move into the Delivery

1352
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:59,159
Systems and here's the array of

1353
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,760
different ways to relate with the plant

1354
00:54:59,159 --> 00:55:02,920
but at some point bringing in a

1355
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:05,520
journaling process and an observation

1356
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:08,400
process and then watching people's lives

1357
00:55:05,519 --> 00:55:11,039
transform again and again by essentially

1358
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:13,880
providing both education but more than

1359
00:55:11,039 --> 00:55:16,159
that empathic Attunement really feeling

1360
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:18,400
into that hugeness as somebody

1361
00:55:16,159 --> 00:55:20,199
approaches the possibility of bringing

1362
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:22,798
an altered state of consciousness into

1363
00:55:20,199 --> 00:55:25,199
their life I do think to help that

1364
00:55:22,798 --> 00:55:26,838
altered state of consciousness to then

1365
00:55:25,199 --> 00:55:29,879
uh sort of be midwife

1366
00:55:26,838 --> 00:55:32,400
or carried toward a sort of therapeutic

1367
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:34,200
Direction can be a relational Dynamic

1368
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:36,639
and that cannabis very often provides

1369
00:55:34,199 --> 00:55:38,879
that opportunity the spirit is there but

1370
00:55:36,639 --> 00:55:41,118
also now there's this one other element

1371
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:43,680
that I feel Community actually needs to

1372
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:46,079
uphold and to hit that highest level of

1373
00:55:43,679 --> 00:55:48,318
meaningful benefits it's great because

1374
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:50,720
that's what the plant plant medicine

1375
00:55:48,318 --> 00:55:53,759
continues to teach us over and over

1376
00:55:50,719 --> 00:55:56,919
again is that set in setting and how

1377
00:55:53,760 --> 00:56:00,000
wonderful that now plant medicine is is

1378
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:01,519
even infiltrating into Western medicine

1379
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,960
and they're even starting to have

1380
00:56:01,519 --> 00:56:07,000
conversations about set in setting and

1381
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:09,480
maybe even painting their their offices

1382
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:12,119
a color that you know is more soothing

1383
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:15,119
to their patients these things are all

1384
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:17,519
coming from from plant medicine you said

1385
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:20,760
color you said color that that's why we

1386
00:56:17,519 --> 00:56:22,119
developed the phyt OFA was because

1387
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:24,240
people couldn't know what was in their

1388
00:56:22,119 --> 00:56:27,039
medicine before I have a question for

1389
00:56:24,239 --> 00:56:32,439
you Dr Lewis which is

1390
00:56:27,039 --> 00:56:32,440
what's type four type five type

1391
00:56:35,679 --> 00:56:39,798
six what's four is what

1392
00:56:40,318 --> 00:56:46,519
cbga five is canabo

1393
00:56:43,079 --> 00:56:49,039
list Rose by Any Other Name who cares

1394
00:56:46,519 --> 00:56:50,280
who cares well it's it's it's important

1395
00:56:49,039 --> 00:56:52,480
because right now this is a

1396
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:54,359
one-dimensional product in a Marketplace

1397
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:56,240
that craves multi-dimensional products

1398
00:56:54,358 --> 00:56:58,358
you add CBD now you have it

1399
00:56:56,239 --> 00:57:01,118
two-dimensional product plus with all

1400
00:56:58,358 --> 00:57:05,440
the tpin oh look there's a phytx that's

1401
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:07,480
nice I absolutely agree with you so so

1402
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:10,639
when you're dealing with all of these

1403
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:12,318
these things these components and then

1404
00:57:10,639 --> 00:57:14,639
you have all the you have the cultivar

1405
00:57:12,318 --> 00:57:17,000
strain names on top of it it creates

1406
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:19,440
this white noise where no one can hear

1407
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:21,239
anything and this is why we developed

1408
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:24,318
the phyto fact was so that people could

1409
00:57:21,239 --> 00:57:27,279
look at a tool and and and recognize

1410
00:57:24,318 --> 00:57:29,279
things for instance somebody comes in

1411
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:31,519
and they're looking for something that's

1412
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:33,480
limine dominant and they usually use the

1413
00:57:31,519 --> 00:57:36,280
space force one that's on the right it's

1414
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:39,119
high THC thing but then they have all

1415
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:41,440
these other googly Gob names out there I

1416
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:44,760
don't know I've heard a bunch

1417
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:46,798
on for you you we put these up a lot or

1418
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:48,799
not I I just think that a lot of people

1419
00:57:46,798 --> 00:57:50,239
have SE these for the first time so why

1420
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:52,159
don't you walk us through the different

1421
00:57:50,239 --> 00:57:53,838
sections of the phyto fact so people can

1422
00:57:52,159 --> 00:57:57,920
understand how to read them like the

1423
00:57:53,838 --> 00:58:00,159
Canada and then the you know sounds good

1424
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:01,960
so if you if you look at the sorry

1425
00:58:00,159 --> 00:58:03,358
Marcus can you make that a little bigger

1426
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:04,798
because I feel I find it a little hard

1427
00:58:03,358 --> 00:58:07,279
to read and if if you could that would

1428
00:58:04,798 --> 00:58:08,920
be cool bring the screen in but go ahead

1429
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:10,880
you can also Zoom it in on your computer

1430
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:12,960
Control Plus or if you're on a Mac just

1431
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:16,200
use

1432
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:18,358
your your your scroll pad or whatever

1433
00:58:16,199 --> 00:58:20,159
yeah on Zoom also you can move your bar

1434
00:58:18,358 --> 00:58:23,358
over so it gets

1435
00:58:20,159 --> 00:58:25,759
larger nice cool while he messes with

1436
00:58:23,358 --> 00:58:27,960
that I'll get started here so are these

1437
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:32,760
are these DET turpine profiles of cured

1438
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:36,559
bud or of Fresh Harvest okay these are

1439
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:38,920
so the reason that this was developed

1440
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:42,519
just so give you a little backstory

1441
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:45,680
here was back in the wild wild west days

1442
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:48,038
at dispensaries you know intake day

1443
00:58:45,679 --> 00:58:50,118
where they were buying flowers would be

1444
00:58:48,039 --> 00:58:54,319
a a a line

1445
00:58:50,119 --> 00:58:56,240
of people out the door with duffel bags

1446
00:58:54,318 --> 00:58:58,960
and you know managers would be on the

1447
00:58:56,239 --> 00:59:01,399
spot to Eton knows exactly what I'm

1448
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:04,240
talking about especially in Berkeley I

1449
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:06,559
mean you would have like 80 people lined

1450
00:59:04,239 --> 00:59:10,639
up half of them with dirty fingernails

1451
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:14,079
and like cat hair in their weed oh yeah

1452
00:59:10,639 --> 00:59:16,038
yeah so much cat hair dog hair sometimes

1453
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:18,680
it out right yeah dude we found bloody

1454
00:59:16,039 --> 00:59:20,359
razor blades I mean you you name it it's

1455
00:59:18,679 --> 00:59:22,598
in there and you would actually be

1456
00:59:20,358 --> 00:59:25,119
physically sick for a day or two after

1457
00:59:22,599 --> 00:59:28,119
from smelling all the mold and and pests

1458
00:59:25,119 --> 00:59:31,000
and pathogens are you know coming up

1459
00:59:28,119 --> 00:59:33,559
anyway so we would find that there was

1460
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:35,960
no quality standard for the products

1461
00:59:33,559 --> 00:59:38,880
being purchased and you know favoritism

1462
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:41,119
was a thing we got commissioned to

1463
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:44,280
create a certificate of analysis for

1464
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:46,200
finished products so this isn't a phyto

1465
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:48,680
effect of a wet flower these are

1466
00:59:46,199 --> 00:59:51,000
chemical analysis of finished products

1467
00:59:48,679 --> 00:59:53,759
and starting at the top or at the very

1468
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:56,639
bottom because it ties into the top uh

1469
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:57,920
is the phyto print that's essentially a

1470
00:59:56,639 --> 01:00:00,920
tpine

1471
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:03,680
fingerprint that is you know our

1472
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:05,200
laboratory analyzes like 60 plus low

1473
01:00:03,679 --> 01:00:09,038
molecular weight and high molecular

1474
01:00:05,199 --> 01:00:12,038
weight tpes and molecules that actually

1475
01:00:09,039 --> 01:00:13,680
create the total nose bouquet these

1476
01:00:12,039 --> 01:00:16,839
aren't all of the molecules that

1477
01:00:13,679 --> 01:00:19,558
contribute to the uh flavor and Aroma

1478
01:00:16,838 --> 01:00:23,199
but they are the top 17 that are

1479
01:00:19,559 --> 01:00:28,640
commonly occurring and most biologically

1480
01:00:23,199 --> 01:00:31,118
relevant Okay so it's colorcoded from

1481
01:00:28,639 --> 01:00:34,598
just like Roy G Biv like a rainbow and

1482
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:38,079
the warm tones are associated with

1483
01:00:34,599 --> 01:00:40,440
sativa like um effects we don't have a

1484
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:42,039
terpinolene dominant plant in here but

1485
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:44,119
that would be the red bar at the very

1486
01:00:42,039 --> 01:00:46,799
top and you've heard us discuss how

1487
01:00:44,119 --> 01:00:49,680
terpinolene has a tendency to make some

1488
01:00:46,798 --> 01:00:52,400
people anxious While others like David

1489
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:54,078
really liked the train wreck bubble hash

1490
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:57,280
that was hydrenaline because he said it

1491
01:00:54,079 --> 01:01:00,839
was the most sativa uh hash that was

1492
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:03,480
available when he visited um lyine is a

1493
01:01:00,838 --> 01:01:05,719
warm tone as well so those represent

1494
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:09,000
kind of sativa like plants and then as

1495
01:01:05,719 --> 01:01:11,759
you go down into the green is pining you

1496
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:14,559
know the blues are the your your cesa

1497
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:17,039
Turpin your humin your caropines and

1498
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:18,480
then linol and mercine are at the bottom

1499
01:01:17,039 --> 01:01:21,880
they're more associated with your

1500
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:26,079
indicia like effects so you can kind of

1501
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:28,480
associate your cultivar name so like if

1502
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:31,200
you look at a Girl Scout cookies if it

1503
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:34,199
would be just beta Carling dominant with

1504
01:01:31,199 --> 01:01:37,199
little huming and limine little

1505
01:01:34,199 --> 01:01:40,118
mercy and then once you find a cultivar

1506
01:01:37,199 --> 01:01:41,759
you like based on nose and flavor you

1507
01:01:40,119 --> 01:01:43,680
don't have to remember all the strain

1508
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:46,359
names associated with it it just becomes

1509
01:01:43,679 --> 01:01:50,118
color pattern recognition which is way

1510
01:01:46,358 --> 01:01:52,000
easier for our Simple Minds to to grasp

1511
01:01:50,119 --> 01:01:54,200
I like the purple ones I like the yellow

1512
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:57,559
ones and you know Dave would like the

1513
01:01:54,199 --> 01:02:00,199
red ones right so um if you go

1514
01:01:57,559 --> 01:02:02,640
back it's important to notice too that

1515
01:02:00,199 --> 01:02:04,759
like the colors for example that you see

1516
01:02:02,639 --> 01:02:07,759
on this Bottom bar graph like the actual

1517
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:09,760
colored bar graph is correlated to the

1518
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:12,039
Entourage effect and the smell and the

1519
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:15,079
aroma um so you can see that the

1520
01:02:12,039 --> 01:02:17,799
Entourage effect they're also um they're

1521
01:02:15,079 --> 01:02:18,920
also colorcoded so for example on this

1522
01:02:17,798 --> 01:02:22,400
one that we're looking at here on the

1523
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:24,440
left it's hyamine which is the orange um

1524
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:27,240
on the the lower section of the phyo

1525
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:29,519
print or the turbine profile is you can

1526
01:02:27,239 --> 01:02:31,679
if you look up one panel above it on the

1527
01:02:29,519 --> 01:02:34,400
right side you can see that it's also

1528
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:35,838
highest in in the orange triangle which

1529
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:40,200
is associated with

1530
01:02:35,838 --> 01:02:42,679
Comm right so the idea is that this is a

1531
01:02:40,199 --> 01:02:44,439
lab report format that either that a lab

1532
01:02:42,679 --> 01:02:46,318
will give you that you might see at a

1533
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:49,240
dispensary or you might see it on a

1534
01:02:46,318 --> 01:02:50,759
packaging but the idea is that like Mark

1535
01:02:49,239 --> 01:02:52,719
is saying even without getting in all

1536
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:55,079
the nitty-gritty details you're

1537
01:02:52,719 --> 01:02:57,318
subliminally being fed these these

1538
01:02:55,079 --> 01:02:58,880
messages um like Mark can you actually

1539
01:02:57,318 --> 01:03:00,480
scroll up a little bit since you're on

1540
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:04,240
we're sharing your

1541
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:06,920
screen how much VAR do you see inine

1542
01:03:04,239 --> 01:03:09,118
profile from from Harvest to harvest

1543
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:11,519
from grow to grow it seems like that

1544
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:14,440
would be really variable and that

1545
01:03:11,519 --> 01:03:16,119
ultimately is gonna affect that graph

1546
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:18,079
above and the other thing I just wanted

1547
01:03:16,119 --> 01:03:20,838
to ask you Mark we had an interesting

1548
01:03:18,079 --> 01:03:23,960
discussion in in clubhouse with Mike

1549
01:03:20,838 --> 01:03:27,199
Backus the other night and I asked him

1550
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:29,798
specifically um does he see what change

1551
01:03:27,199 --> 01:03:33,358
in the tpine profile between Fresh

1552
01:03:29,798 --> 01:03:36,480
Harvest and and cure does he see and

1553
01:03:33,358 --> 01:03:41,318
specifically does he see uh any increase

1554
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:43,358
in lenol with decrease in in uh in

1555
01:03:41,318 --> 01:03:45,599
Marine and the correlated question I

1556
01:03:43,358 --> 01:03:47,679
would ask based on what we dis what you

1557
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:50,640
had discussed earlier is you know

1558
01:03:47,679 --> 01:03:53,480
terpinolene is one of what four isomers

1559
01:03:50,639 --> 01:03:57,558
of of turpine and all of those can

1560
01:03:53,480 --> 01:04:01,639
oxidize to terpenol and tpol certainly

1561
01:03:57,559 --> 01:04:04,079
has a very different fragrance than than

1562
01:04:01,639 --> 01:04:06,838
T terpinolene itself so I was wondering

1563
01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:11,240
if you could comment on how these tpine

1564
01:04:06,838 --> 01:04:15,400
profiles change between Harvest and cure

1565
01:04:11,239 --> 01:04:17,598
okay um real quick I I'll hit that in a

1566
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:20,318
second just that you see the cultiv our

1567
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:22,559
name at the top of this report and then

1568
01:04:20,318 --> 01:04:24,639
the top three tpin create that color

1569
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:26,640
code so that's that was the pattern

1570
01:04:24,639 --> 01:04:29,400
recognition I was talking about about

1571
01:04:26,639 --> 01:04:31,400
now when we discovered so one of the

1572
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:34,760
things we do in the laboratory when

1573
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:37,440
we're trying you know Skunk Works no pun

1574
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:39,960
intended actually we'll buy analytical

1575
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:41,679
standards and we'll smell them you know

1576
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:43,159
because we'll find little blips and hit

1577
01:04:41,679 --> 01:04:44,679
on the mass spec and determine its

1578
01:04:43,159 --> 01:04:47,199
molecular weight and like oh I wonder if

1579
01:04:44,679 --> 01:04:49,159
it's this or that and one day we opened

1580
01:04:47,199 --> 01:04:51,960
up a bottle of hexal

1581
01:04:49,159 --> 01:04:54,278
butyrate and it's it's it smells like

1582
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:57,039
luden's cherry cough drops I mean it

1583
01:04:54,278 --> 01:04:59,838
literally a string Cherry makes your mou

1584
01:04:57,039 --> 01:05:03,359
mouth water as soon as you you smell it

1585
01:04:59,838 --> 01:05:05,838
so very different than Beric acid right

1586
01:05:03,358 --> 01:05:09,480
very very different yes and so acid

1587
01:05:05,838 --> 01:05:12,400
smells like puke so what we did was we

1588
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:14,599
went straight to the chromatograms uh

1589
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:16,519
well we shot that on the on the GC we

1590
01:05:14,599 --> 01:05:18,200
looked at it retention time we looked at

1591
01:05:16,519 --> 01:05:20,759
all the chromatograms for all the plants

1592
01:05:18,199 --> 01:05:23,159
that we'd analyze and um we found little

1593
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:26,240
blips then we immediately called up

1594
01:05:23,159 --> 01:05:28,078
molecular farms and said hey these code

1595
01:05:26,239 --> 01:05:30,719
numbers have those blips start

1596
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:33,200
inbreeding them and they they imbred

1597
01:05:30,719 --> 01:05:36,480
like four generations until that blip

1598
01:05:33,199 --> 01:05:38,919
became so concentrated it was almost 1%

1599
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:40,880
hexalite and I mean that plant when it's

1600
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:43,680
in the field you you get that little

1601
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:45,920
Tricom rub and smell it makes your mouth

1602
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:49,440
water smells like luden's cherry cough

1603
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:52,639
drops it's pining dominant with merine

1604
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:56,318
in it you take that plant and you cure

1605
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:58,318
it dry it and cure it and you know it's

1606
01:05:56,318 --> 01:06:01,239
best fresh not like sitting for a month

1607
01:05:58,318 --> 01:06:04,199
or anything but over time the hexal rate

1608
01:06:01,239 --> 01:06:09,399
will just and it be gone because it's a

1609
01:06:04,199 --> 01:06:11,598
low molecular weight tpine right and Dr

1610
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:14,000
is that just evaporation it's not

1611
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:17,599
transforming into something else correct

1612
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:22,639
correct it's just fugitive okay yeah so

1613
01:06:17,599 --> 01:06:24,240
um so and if you it can let me back up

1614
01:06:22,639 --> 01:06:27,759
it can transform to something else if

1615
01:06:24,239 --> 01:06:31,000
you leave it in the jar too long and it

1616
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:36,160
get oxidized but if you look at the

1617
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:37,599
flowers on the plant to to to the I mean

1618
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:41,199
sorry the Turpin on the plant to the

1619
01:06:37,599 --> 01:06:43,559
finished product um there can be little

1620
01:06:41,199 --> 01:06:46,199
change or there can be massive change to

1621
01:06:43,559 --> 01:06:48,599
the relative profile and it all depends

1622
01:06:46,199 --> 01:06:51,159
on your post Harvest

1623
01:06:48,599 --> 01:06:53,720
postprocessing um conditions and that's

1624
01:06:51,159 --> 01:06:57,078
that's one of the things that Nao really

1625
01:06:53,719 --> 01:06:59,798
helps cultivators with because most

1626
01:06:57,079 --> 01:07:02,599
cultivators and you know I I know that

1627
01:06:59,798 --> 01:07:04,278
the people listen to show aren't most

1628
01:07:02,599 --> 01:07:06,200
cultivators the people on the show

1629
01:07:04,278 --> 01:07:08,358
probably know how to dry and cure a

1630
01:07:06,199 --> 01:07:10,719
plant to preserve their Turpin but most

1631
01:07:08,358 --> 01:07:12,078
people destroy the plant like they

1632
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:15,278
they're they're worried about cost of

1633
01:07:12,079 --> 01:07:18,480
goods they're worried about bus business

1634
01:07:15,278 --> 01:07:20,798
stuff you know not not not like us we

1635
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:25,000
worship the plant you know it's like we

1636
01:07:20,798 --> 01:07:26,960
want that exact flavor of a fresh flour

1637
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:28,798
in in our products at the end because

1638
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:32,720
that smells so freaking good and it

1639
01:07:28,798 --> 01:07:35,079
tastes so so good and the you know we

1640
01:07:32,719 --> 01:07:38,118
work with folks in the on the hemp side

1641
01:07:35,079 --> 01:07:41,960
who um do tpine distillation of the hemp

1642
01:07:38,119 --> 01:07:45,480
and they they exclusively beg for the

1643
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:47,720
the the bi um hemp genetics because they

1644
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:50,559
have that happy pineapple in hemp they

1645
01:07:47,719 --> 01:07:52,919
have pining dominant cultivars and hemp

1646
01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:55,599
so they can get those cannabis drive

1647
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:56,798
tpin and they they they literally chop

1648
01:07:55,599 --> 01:07:58,838
the plant down and throw it in the

1649
01:07:56,798 --> 01:08:01,199
extractor immediately don't freeze it

1650
01:07:58,838 --> 01:08:04,480
don't take it anywhere and the tpine

1651
01:08:01,199 --> 01:08:07,278
profiles are very very similar to those

1652
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:10,039
that you find in the plant and then

1653
01:08:07,278 --> 01:08:12,199
those cannabinoid or those hemp or

1654
01:08:10,039 --> 01:08:16,838
cannabis Drive tpin can be used in Vape

1655
01:08:12,199 --> 01:08:18,798
pins in in the you know THC Marketplace

1656
01:08:16,838 --> 01:08:21,238
and when you hit those Vape pins and

1657
01:08:18,798 --> 01:08:23,439
exhale it smells like fresh flour it's

1658
01:08:21,238 --> 01:08:25,559
really it's really amazing um and I'd

1659
01:08:23,439 --> 01:08:27,079
like to if you want to pull up the phofa

1660
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:28,798
I can finish going through it or or we

1661
01:08:27,079 --> 01:08:31,519
can ditch it it's up to you Marcus

1662
01:08:28,798 --> 01:08:34,838
you're the sort of the moderator but I I

1663
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:36,520
would like to show that you know this

1664
01:08:34,838 --> 01:08:39,359
thing has these two bar charts at the

1665
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:42,759
top that have cannabinoids and

1666
01:08:39,359 --> 01:08:45,838
terpenoids and we set this scale at 25%

1667
01:08:42,759 --> 01:08:48,640
and 2.5% because when people would come

1668
01:08:45,838 --> 01:08:50,640
to the dispensaries with you know pounds

1669
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:52,359
from the hill or whatever if we just

1670
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:54,440
looked at these two bars and they were

1671
01:08:52,359 --> 01:08:56,400
pegged the manager would know that's

1672
01:08:54,439 --> 01:09:00,079
good flower that's that's that's some

1673
01:08:56,399 --> 01:09:02,719
good [ __ ] but most of the stuff in

1674
01:09:00,079 --> 01:09:06,359
California even to this day doesn't test

1675
01:09:02,719 --> 01:09:09,039
above 1.5% TP sometimes in the two 2%

1676
01:09:06,359 --> 01:09:10,239
range and you know canabo are all over

1677
01:09:09,039 --> 01:09:13,560
the place and it depends on your

1678
01:09:10,238 --> 01:09:16,278
laboratory and whatnot but this uh you

1679
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:20,239
go down below that bar chart um and you

1680
01:09:16,279 --> 01:09:22,040
have a a dial of THC to the next highest

1681
01:09:20,238 --> 01:09:25,399
cannabinoid in this case of happy

1682
01:09:22,039 --> 01:09:30,119
pineapple it's cbga so this is about 20%

1683
01:09:25,399 --> 01:09:33,838
THC about 8% CBG and this is a very very

1684
01:09:30,119 --> 01:09:37,158
unique cultivar it tastes delicious and

1685
01:09:33,838 --> 01:09:40,600
when you long cure this particular flow

1686
01:09:37,158 --> 01:09:43,198
it takes on an distinct vanilla Aroma

1687
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:45,199
it's totally unique but when it's fresh

1688
01:09:43,198 --> 01:09:48,879
it smells straight up like fresh

1689
01:09:45,198 --> 01:09:52,759
pineapple because you know this osaman

1690
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:56,000
dominance there was only one plant uh of

1691
01:09:52,759 --> 01:09:57,560
osaman dominant cannabis ever tested did

1692
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:00,840
in the state of California until like

1693
01:09:57,560 --> 01:10:03,400
two and a half three years ago and um

1694
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:05,199
and now is there more there there's a

1695
01:10:03,399 --> 01:10:07,679
couple more yeah well I mean most of I

1696
01:10:05,198 --> 01:10:09,319
mean molecular has about 10 of them that

1697
01:10:07,679 --> 01:10:11,440
goes through the system but you know

1698
01:10:09,319 --> 01:10:15,519
there was the live reson of this taste

1699
01:10:11,439 --> 01:10:17,559
like yeah I was gonna ask Dr Lewis we've

1700
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:20,400
we've only done the and shout out to

1701
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:23,239
Marcus for turning us on to the the pure

1702
01:10:20,399 --> 01:10:28,879
pressure we've all we've only done the

1703
01:10:23,238 --> 01:10:31,359
flower rosin um they they just uh this

1704
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:35,079
they just planted enough this this

1705
01:10:31,359 --> 01:10:38,000
spring to be able to do a large run of

1706
01:10:35,079 --> 01:10:40,439
of you know the the bubble hash to live

1707
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:42,840
Ros and thing I'm more of a scientist

1708
01:10:40,439 --> 01:10:44,359
and you know I I see oversee the quality

1709
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:46,319
control of those types of things but

1710
01:10:44,359 --> 01:10:48,960
there's like hash experts that do that

1711
01:10:46,319 --> 01:10:51,799
stuff um and we just do the chemical

1712
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:54,719
analysis right or offer ways to improve

1713
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:57,400
the performance of their extraction um I

1714
01:10:54,719 --> 01:11:01,800
I have a question for you Dr Lewis with

1715
01:10:57,399 --> 01:11:04,479
your phofa the happy pineapple it shows

1716
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:07,279
what like an orangish color then blue

1717
01:11:04,479 --> 01:11:10,839
then green why those

1718
01:11:07,279 --> 01:11:13,679
colors because osine is colored orange

1719
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:16,039
and it's the top tpine beta carara

1720
01:11:13,679 --> 01:11:18,560
offene is blue in the phyto print and

1721
01:11:16,039 --> 01:11:22,479
it's the second most abundant and the

1722
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:25,840
green is the tiny I I yeah I can't see

1723
01:11:22,479 --> 01:11:28,359
the entire bottom of the photo by pack

1724
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:31,039
so that's why

1725
01:11:28,359 --> 01:11:33,639
gotcha now it's becomes much more

1726
01:11:31,039 --> 01:11:37,238
apparent right so so then you think

1727
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:38,560
about uh the smoothness of a smoke right

1728
01:11:37,238 --> 01:11:41,079
like because that was one of the things

1729
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:42,679
that you know Ryan and I always wanted

1730
01:11:41,079 --> 01:11:44,880
was smooth

1731
01:11:42,679 --> 01:11:46,719
smoke it all it all has to do with

1732
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:48,960
having beta carry offline in there I

1733
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:52,000
mean that that really takes the edge off

1734
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:54,800
of any tarpine and you know some turpins

1735
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:56,760
if you like Alpha pining if it's really

1736
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:58,639
pining dominant and there isn't a whole

1737
01:11:56,760 --> 01:12:01,079
lot of anything else it can be pretty

1738
01:11:58,639 --> 01:12:05,400
harsh on the back of your

1739
01:12:01,079 --> 01:12:09,479
throat so so it's it's similarly with

1740
01:12:05,399 --> 01:12:10,759
terpinolene um but it you have to

1741
01:12:09,479 --> 01:12:14,678
balance that and when when you're

1742
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:16,239
breeding parentals or other things for a

1743
01:12:14,679 --> 01:12:18,840
product you have to take all of that

1744
01:12:16,238 --> 01:12:20,519
into account you can't just pheno hunt

1745
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:22,440
you know I mean that's part of it that's

1746
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:24,400
the funnest part but you have to be

1747
01:12:22,439 --> 01:12:26,799
really thoughtful on how you design a

1748
01:12:24,399 --> 01:12:29,238
new technology like a plant like this

1749
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:30,320
holy crunch right here I mean this thing

1750
01:12:29,238 --> 01:12:34,839
has

1751
01:12:30,319 --> 01:12:39,000
28% you know canabo and it's beta carene

1752
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:42,079
lming it's a one to one basically and it

1753
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:45,520
it it is the smoothest tastiest smoke

1754
01:12:42,079 --> 01:12:47,319
and most people you a lot of these

1755
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:49,440
products you just have people smoke them

1756
01:12:47,319 --> 01:12:51,759
and they can't distinguish you know

1757
01:12:49,439 --> 01:12:53,399
they'll be like that's great and be like

1758
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:55,719
hey you know that's enhanced you know

1759
01:12:53,399 --> 01:12:58,399
type to and they'll be like know what

1760
01:12:55,719 --> 01:13:00,679
I'm like yeah see you can get high off

1761
01:12:58,399 --> 01:13:02,359
this stuff it's not CBD is not a buzz

1762
01:13:00,679 --> 01:13:04,639
killer it just makes you feel good you

1763
01:13:02,359 --> 01:13:06,519
know what I mean and it's like this one

1764
01:13:04,639 --> 01:13:11,760
is very very popular it actually won the

1765
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:14,360
emerald Cup in uh last year uh or two

1766
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:18,239
last year yeah I think so in the CBD

1767
01:13:14,359 --> 01:13:20,759
flower category technically CBD can be a

1768
01:13:18,238 --> 01:13:23,839
buzz killer if you smoke a 100

1769
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:28,239
milligrams of pure CBD early in the

1770
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:29,480
morning then try to smoke uh even 100

1771
01:13:28,238 --> 01:13:32,238
milligrams of

1772
01:13:29,479 --> 01:13:35,799
THC but you know wait like a half an

1773
01:13:32,238 --> 01:13:39,759
hour or so and and you'll find out that

1774
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:44,400
the THC has little or no effect if you

1775
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:45,960
fled yourself with CBD first yeah well

1776
01:13:44,399 --> 01:13:47,679
nobody I don't think anyone really wants

1777
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:50,480
to bedge in themselves with CBD when

1778
01:13:47,679 --> 01:13:53,199
they wake up in the morning that's it's

1779
01:13:50,479 --> 01:13:54,559
painful so there's there's a couple of

1780
01:13:53,198 --> 01:13:56,238
things with with type twos in the

1781
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:59,199
marketplace I mean they've tried to roll

1782
01:13:56,238 --> 01:14:00,678
them out and granted I think the vast

1783
01:13:59,198 --> 01:14:02,439
majority of type twos that have been on

1784
01:14:00,679 --> 01:14:05,840
the market in Canada have been M SE

1785
01:14:02,439 --> 01:14:07,439
dominant they're all canonic and canonic

1786
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:11,279
hybrids

1787
01:14:07,439 --> 01:14:13,479
um but they they're having like zero

1788
01:14:11,279 --> 01:14:15,319
uptake on the market right like it's all

1789
01:14:13,479 --> 01:14:18,638
type one everybody wants everything over

1790
01:14:15,319 --> 01:14:20,319
20% THC actually Ryan there's an amazing

1791
01:14:18,639 --> 01:14:22,239
shift that's been happening in the

1792
01:14:20,319 --> 01:14:24,399
Oregon market we've been fighting this

1793
01:14:22,238 --> 01:14:26,238
battle for a while of course to out

1794
01:14:24,399 --> 01:14:28,759
production space

1795
01:14:26,238 --> 01:14:30,079
to Sor I know what happens down there in

1796
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:31,639
California I'm just trying to make a

1797
01:14:30,079 --> 01:14:34,840
point about the Canadian Marketplace how

1798
01:14:31,639 --> 01:14:38,119
it's not able to adopt you guys been

1799
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:40,719
able to do a bunch of product knowledge

1800
01:14:38,119 --> 01:14:43,238
you know Market education that that has

1801
01:14:40,719 --> 01:14:44,760
led to the acceptance right so how do

1802
01:14:43,238 --> 01:14:47,439
how do we go about doing that in in

1803
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:49,480
markets where they're not as refined

1804
01:14:47,439 --> 01:14:52,678
like how do you how do you go about

1805
01:14:49,479 --> 01:14:55,439
rolling out in a new market the question

1806
01:14:52,679 --> 01:14:57,560
often is the popular education element

1807
01:14:55,439 --> 01:14:59,559
combined with the genetics combined with

1808
01:14:57,560 --> 01:15:01,639
The Talented folks who are producing

1809
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:03,679
breeding growing but I really love that

1810
01:15:01,639 --> 01:15:05,679
I think cultivation classic was a big

1811
01:15:03,679 --> 01:15:08,480
impact in Oregon Market because there

1812
01:15:05,679 --> 01:15:11,399
was huge emphasis on type two it got

1813
01:15:08,479 --> 01:15:13,519
equal attention to ones and threes and

1814
01:15:11,399 --> 01:15:15,799
obviously there was way fewer entries

1815
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:17,560
but I just remember back to only three

1816
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:21,039
years ago when I was trying to sell type

1817
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:22,719
tws and couldn't get $400 a pound I am

1818
01:15:21,039 --> 01:15:24,079
now selling astral works and this is one

1819
01:15:22,719 --> 01:15:26,239
of the more exciting personal

1820
01:15:24,079 --> 01:15:27,880
accomplishments that like it exists for

1821
01:15:26,238 --> 01:15:30,799
at least more than the cost of

1822
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:33,000
production and it is finally a viable

1823
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:34,600
product that lives and now there's about

1824
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:36,479
three other products that are also

1825
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:38,639
almost at that level it's been such a

1826
01:15:36,479 --> 01:15:40,839
battle though like you said I I just the

1827
01:15:38,639 --> 01:15:42,880
question is really how do we help a lot

1828
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:45,000
of people come into a kind of new

1829
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:46,359
awareness about a new product category I

1830
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:48,319
loved what Mark said that there really

1831
01:15:46,359 --> 01:15:50,839
are these kind of entirely new

1832
01:15:48,319 --> 01:15:53,158
categories and this is why I like types

1833
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:55,600
I mean the CBG dominant varieties now

1834
01:15:53,158 --> 01:15:58,679
seeing type four hybrid

1835
01:15:55,600 --> 01:16:00,760
coming into this uh this new space I'm

1836
01:15:58,679 --> 01:16:03,719
really excited to see like I've yet to

1837
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:07,239
see a type four hybrid on the market in

1838
01:16:03,719 --> 01:16:09,439
the wreck market and I feel like that's

1839
01:16:07,238 --> 01:16:11,638
going to represent a whole new set of

1840
01:16:09,439 --> 01:16:14,399
interesting possibilities and i' and

1841
01:16:11,639 --> 01:16:17,000
I've yet to wonder and I've yet to see a

1842
01:16:14,399 --> 01:16:18,960
type four hybrid with tpping like

1843
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:21,279
somehow when they knocked out that

1844
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:24,119
cannabinoid pathway I mean they don't

1845
01:16:21,279 --> 01:16:27,158
test higher than 6% turps it's very

1846
01:16:24,119 --> 01:16:29,119
bizarre but they smell kind of like all

1847
01:16:27,158 --> 01:16:31,679
of them have a similar like citrusy kind

1848
01:16:29,119 --> 01:16:33,719
of smell note to them and they look

1849
01:16:31,679 --> 01:16:35,520
really beautiful like Frosty kind of

1850
01:16:33,719 --> 01:16:37,319
like blackberry kush did back in the day

1851
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:40,400
remember it like was the frostiest

1852
01:16:37,319 --> 01:16:42,840
flower and like where's the triome heads

1853
01:16:40,399 --> 01:16:44,079
but pretty pretty interesting production

1854
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:46,600
plant

1855
01:16:44,079 --> 01:16:49,399
there hey guys this might be a good uh

1856
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:51,719
opportunity to um hear from a few people

1857
01:16:49,399 --> 01:16:55,119
who we haven't heard from um I thought

1858
01:16:51,719 --> 01:16:57,359
Alec was going to come in and sort of uh

1859
01:16:55,119 --> 01:16:59,079
introduce his friend Joe who I'm

1860
01:16:57,359 --> 01:17:01,519
actually just meeting so I wanted to

1861
01:16:59,079 --> 01:17:03,479

the emerald cup flower judging this year

1864
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:09,159
and Alec thought it would be good for

1865
01:17:07,079 --> 01:17:11,079
you to be a part of the conversation and

1866
01:17:09,158 --> 01:17:13,920

years um I'm also a buyer for a couple

1879

dispensaries in our area um so it's

1880

awesome to hear you guys talk about tpin

1881
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:48,679
uh Dr Lewis I was actually uh can

1882
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:50,520
sympathize with sitting in those rooms

1883
01:17:48,679 --> 01:17:52,440
when the people were coming down off the

1884
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:55,000
hill and those lines you know kind of

1885
01:17:52,439 --> 01:17:56,119
going through those different bags um it

1886
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:59,079
it's kind of awesome we're one of the

1887
01:17:56,119 --> 01:18:00,039
first dispensaries to do require testing

1888
01:17:59,079 --> 01:18:02,479
um that's kind of how I have my

1889
01:18:00,039 --> 01:18:03,800
relationship with Alec over at SC Labs

1890
01:18:02,479 --> 01:18:06,039
um we've been rolling out a whole

1891
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:08,279
turpine education program over the last

1892
01:18:06,039 --> 01:18:09,800
six months um and then yeah with the

1893
01:18:08,279 --> 01:18:11,079
judging this year it's funny I've

1894
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:12,800
actually been you know listening to you

1895
01:18:11,079 --> 01:18:14,880
guys talk I love it I'm really curious

1896
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:16,800
to know kind of what those tpping levels

1897
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:19,239
are in some of those enhanced strains

1898
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:20,880
you're talking about um that's actually

1899
01:18:19,238 --> 01:18:24,039
how I've been curating now with the

1900
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:26,440
tpine profiles on the R&amp;D it allows me

1901
01:18:24,039 --> 01:18:28,800
to have a more diverse menu on the shelf

1902
01:18:26,439 --> 01:18:30,000
and really start to focus on the tpin

1903
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:31,520
and the different effects you're getting

1904
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,760
from those plants with their

1905
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:37,199
relationship with conoids and it's not

1906
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:38,800
just all about those 20 25% hitters so

1907
01:18:37,198 --> 01:18:40,000
yeah we're going through the flowers

1908
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:41,079
right now I actually have a bunch of

1909
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,679
them right here it's kind of cool

1910
01:18:41,079 --> 01:18:45,000
they're they're actually you can see

1911
01:18:42,679 --> 01:18:48,319
they're they're uh they're typed out by

1912
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:50,760
their different profile what you do

1913
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:53,079
working my way through that right now he

1914
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:54,880
and um yeah it's really interesting but

1915
01:18:53,079 --> 01:18:56,719
um I am curious to know kind of what

1916
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:59,400
those tpine levels are um that you're

1917
01:18:56,719 --> 01:19:00,840
seeing in those enhanced strains um so

1918
01:18:59,399 --> 01:19:03,279
yeah thank you guys I'm really happy to

1919
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:06,039
be here hey are you uh using the phyt

1920
01:19:03,279 --> 01:19:08,319
OFA now that se Labs is uh pumping them

1921
01:19:06,039 --> 01:19:10,719
out yeah we've been using the phofa for

1922
01:19:08,319 --> 01:19:12,399
a while um I started we started reaching

1923
01:19:10,719 --> 01:19:15,840
out obviously for myself I started

1924
01:19:12,399 --> 01:19:18,519
watching cultivars die in our space as

1925
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:20,000
Growers were unable to make money off

1926
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:21,880
them anymore because they didn't hit

1927
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:24,760
certain THC percentages which we know

1928
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:26,960
with the labs can vary so much right and

1929
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:29,400
so when we switch from our traditional

1930
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:31,760
Market Days to U the new Rec days the

1931
01:19:29,399 --> 01:19:33,679
way it was marketed is um everyone's

1932
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:35,039
coming in for that you know that that

1933
01:19:33,679 --> 01:19:37,079
liquor proof you know it's like you

1934
01:19:35,039 --> 01:19:38,399
don't go to the bar looking for Hunter

1935
01:19:37,079 --> 01:19:39,479
proof schnaps all the time you might

1936
01:19:38,399 --> 01:19:40,879
want a beer might want something a

1937
01:19:39,479 --> 01:19:44,079
little lighter so everyone's been kind

1938
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:46,279
of trained to go to that THC and so

1939
01:19:44,079 --> 01:19:48,760
using the phofa we actually have a QR

1940
01:19:46,279 --> 01:19:50,759
code um that we put on all the flavors

1941
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:53,159
that are um displayed in the store next

1942
01:19:50,760 --> 01:19:55,000
to the tpine wheel um and it kind of

1943
01:19:53,158 --> 01:19:56,319
directs them straight to those so

1944
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:58,840
getting people to understand it it

1945
01:19:56,319 --> 01:20:00,759
starts with um the butt tenders um you

1946
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:04,000
know at our store we're lucky enough to

1947
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:06,000
see around 25,000 people a month um and

1948
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:08,520
so for us we feel like you know that's a

1949
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:10,000
good platform to start and we we wanted

1950
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:12,080
to work with SC we've been testing with

1951
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:13,760
them for a long time and you start

1952
01:20:12,079 --> 01:20:15,119
looking at these different R&amp;D tests and

1953
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:17,719
you start and you start seeing where the

1954
01:20:15,119 --> 01:20:19,238
tpin are um and you start noticing that

1955
01:20:17,719 --> 01:20:22,079
you know mostly if you're seeing those

1956
01:20:19,238 --> 01:20:24,678
top 25 30% THC with like you were saying

1957
01:20:22,079 --> 01:20:27,119
in our Marketplace mostly it's around 1%

1958
01:20:24,679 --> 01:20:28,600
% tpine you know a little less you're

1959
01:20:27,119 --> 01:20:31,359
basically looking at biomass in my

1960
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:33,039
opinion so for us being able to cult uh

1961
01:20:31,359 --> 01:20:35,439
curate something that's that's

1962
01:20:33,039 --> 01:20:37,399
beneficial um on a medicinal level

1963
01:20:35,439 --> 01:20:38,719
considering that we were rooted in that

1964
01:20:37,399 --> 01:20:40,879
and that's that's kind of our culture

1965
01:20:38,719 --> 01:20:42,800
here in our area is the medicinal

1966
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:45,039
benefits from the plant um it's really

1967
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:47,400
being able to pair that right cultivar

1968
01:20:45,039 --> 01:20:49,479
with the person so um yeah it's it's

1969
01:20:47,399 --> 01:20:51,439
been a challenge um but that's why

1970
01:20:49,479 --> 01:20:54,959
conversations like this are so important

1971
01:20:51,439 --> 01:20:57,399
and I feel so great to be here

1972
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:58,800
wow thanks thanks for that oh I was just

1973
01:20:57,399 --> 01:21:01,119
going to add on to something that he

1974
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:04,079
just said so does it matter if Labs like

1975
01:21:01,119 --> 01:21:07,359
SC labs are in sort of high throughput

1976
01:21:04,079 --> 01:21:10,600
testing mode and using GC to profile

1977
01:21:07,359 --> 01:21:11,599
their tpin or I think you guys use hlc

1978
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:15,719
is there going to be a real big

1979
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:18,400
difference no what just just so just a

1980
01:21:15,719 --> 01:21:20,480
little background on Neo um I brought a

1981
01:21:18,399 --> 01:21:23,238
bunch of chemists from my grad school

1982
01:21:20,479 --> 01:21:24,879
from Big Pharma to help develop these

1983
01:21:23,238 --> 01:21:27,759
methodologies

1984
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:31,279
um and we wrote a paper we validated a

1985
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:34,960
method for a ro robust reliable um

1986
01:21:31,279 --> 01:21:36,639
analysis of Turin and cannaboids that

1987
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:38,239
essentially became the gold standard for

1988
01:21:36,639 --> 01:21:40,000
the Laboratory Testing industry we made

1989
01:21:38,238 --> 01:21:41,399
it free we paid extra to make it free

1990
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:43,319
open source to everyone because we

1991
01:21:41,399 --> 01:21:45,439
really wanted to fix the laboratory

1992
01:21:43,319 --> 01:21:47,439
problem because we want you know it's

1993
01:21:45,439 --> 01:21:50,919
important that if you want to compare

1994
01:21:47,439 --> 01:21:52,919
apples to apples your Labs can't be you

1995
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:54,600
know doing that confirmational bias

1996
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:56,960
thing where're like well if we say it's

1997
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:58,639
28% we're going to get more business and

1998
01:21:56,960 --> 01:22:02,560
it's like that doesn't work when you're

1999
01:21:58,639 --> 01:22:04,560
trying to you know create a an an in a

2000
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:07,239
real industry right like you don't go to

2001
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:09,159
the pharmacy and pick up the generic

2002
01:22:07,238 --> 01:22:12,439
Tylenol and look at it and be like oh it

2003
01:22:09,158 --> 01:22:16,479
says it's 500 milligrams and it's really

2004
01:22:12,439 --> 01:22:20,559
only 200 um so we made that paper open

2005
01:22:16,479 --> 01:22:23,079
source and the Laboratories uh you know

2006
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:27,400
base their methods off of it and you

2007
01:22:23,079 --> 01:22:29,760
know groups like SC Labs we work we

2008
01:22:27,399 --> 01:22:32,479
service clients who are producers who

2009
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:36,039
are Distributors who we actually SC

2010
01:22:32,479 --> 01:22:37,718
laabs is one of our clients so when we

2011
01:22:36,039 --> 01:22:40,279
send products

2012
01:22:37,719 --> 01:22:42,000
or uh when when one of our clients sends

2013
01:22:40,279 --> 01:22:43,479
a product SC Labs or there's a problem

2014
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:45,719
with pesticide or there's a problem with

2015
01:22:43,479 --> 01:22:47,919
heavy metals what we do is a root cause

2016
01:22:45,719 --> 01:22:50,079
analysis so and then we work directly

2017
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:52,039
with the with the Testing Laboratories

2018
01:22:50,079 --> 01:22:53,559
to try to figure out where the problem

2019
01:22:52,039 --> 01:22:55,039
was was the problem with the producer

2020
01:22:53,560 --> 01:22:59,400
was the problem with the Laboratory

2021
01:22:55,039 --> 01:23:02,079
Testing and SC lab's chemistry is super

2022
01:22:59,399 --> 01:23:04,198
tight like I mean I'm very impressed

2023
01:23:02,079 --> 01:23:07,639
with those guys have been for nearly a

2024
01:23:04,198 --> 01:23:09,198
decade now and yeah so the methodology

2025
01:23:07,639 --> 01:23:10,679
is pretty ironed out and it doesn't

2026
01:23:09,198 --> 01:23:13,960
matter if they're going high throughput

2027
01:23:10,679 --> 01:23:17,600
because you can only go so fast in a in

2028
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:19,039
a in a in a run for like a GC because

2029
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:20,800
you have to get you know Baseline

2030
01:23:19,039 --> 01:23:22,519
resolution and you have to run your

2031
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:25,239
check standards between every run and

2032
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:27,560
all that stuff and those guys are ISO

2033
01:23:25,238 --> 01:23:29,238
certified so you know they've got their

2034
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:31,080
chemistry buttoned up really tight so I

2035
01:23:29,238 --> 01:23:33,519
don't think there's really a difference

2036
01:23:31,079 --> 01:23:37,079
the the difference between a lab like SC

2037
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:41,320
labs and lab like Neo is that we focus

2038
01:23:37,079 --> 01:23:43,000
100% on R&amp;D so we develop methods with

2039
01:23:41,319 --> 01:23:45,079
like perk and Elmer for their

2040
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:47,560
instrumentation so then when a new

2041
01:23:45,079 --> 01:23:48,960
laboratory opens up they can say hey

2042
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:52,159
here's this method that we've already

2043
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:54,679
validated over here and you can analyze

2044
01:23:52,158 --> 01:23:57,879
heavy metals or pesticides or whatever

2045
01:23:54,679 --> 01:24:00,158
it is and you know the it's a it's it's

2046
01:23:57,880 --> 01:24:02,679
a symbiosis right you know everybody

2047
01:24:00,158 --> 01:24:05,759
helping everybody and Meanwhile we're

2048
01:24:02,679 --> 01:24:08,960
developing methods for Growers um you

2049
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:12,920
know whether it's breeding projects or

2050
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:16,920
or or just simply increasing yields and

2051
01:24:12,920 --> 01:24:18,719
lowering the need for pesticides or you

2052
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:21,359
know things like that it's all

2053
01:24:18,719 --> 01:24:25,600
optimization for us and we have a really

2054
01:24:21,359 --> 01:24:28,039
good template so any farmer or or

2055
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:30,320
cultivators who ever need assistance you

2056
01:24:28,039 --> 01:24:31,880
know look us up for sure I mean that's

2057
01:24:30,319 --> 01:24:34,439
what we

2058
01:24:31,880 --> 01:24:37,159
do you know and really quickly like what

2059
01:24:34,439 --> 01:24:39,839
the base how to preserve the T beines in

2060
01:24:37,158 --> 01:24:43,638
a grow you know is valuable for people

2061
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:46,639
to hear again and I maybe the a quick uh

2062
01:24:43,639 --> 01:24:49,520
just what is your best quick way for

2063
01:24:46,639 --> 01:24:52,960
people on farms to preserve their chines

2064
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:56,719
for the market our saying is 60%

2065
01:24:52,960 --> 01:25:00,480
humidity 60% degrees for two weeks or

2066
01:24:56,719 --> 01:25:04,719
what what we call mpm minimally process

2067
01:25:00,479 --> 01:25:07,158
minimally handle slow and cold so you

2068
01:25:04,719 --> 01:25:08,840
got it down if you have a vacuum cooler

2069
01:25:07,158 --> 01:25:10,359
those are there's fun experiments there

2070
01:25:08,840 --> 01:25:13,520
that you know when you when you harvest

2071
01:25:10,359 --> 01:25:16,799
lots of lettuce um you have to use an

2072
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:19,600
actual gigantic vacuum cooler because

2073
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:21,400
otherwise you'll get a mold front as the

2074
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:23,880
head of lettuce begins to try to get

2075
01:25:21,399 --> 01:25:24,839
cold so you have to cold get it cold

2076
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:26,400
fast

2077
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:29,039
there's lots of cool things you can do

2078
01:25:26,399 --> 01:25:31,599
and I'm sure I'm sure Marcus is fluent

2079
01:25:29,039 --> 01:25:34,158
in terpanes with all of the the bubble

2080
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:37,199
hash he's done around the

2081
01:25:34,158 --> 01:25:39,679
world hell yeah you know I'm uh

2082
01:25:37,198 --> 01:25:42,198
definitely fluent in tanese shout out to

2083
01:25:39,679 --> 01:25:44,359
Young turp shout out to Chile for those

2084
01:25:42,198 --> 01:25:47,158
of you that know you know for those of

2085
01:25:44,359 --> 01:25:49,479
you that don't you'll figure it out uh I

2086
01:25:47,158 --> 01:25:52,000
did want to also welcome move to the

2087
01:25:49,479 --> 01:25:53,519
room um how you doing buddy you want to

2088
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:55,198
uh tell everyone a little bit about

2089
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:57,760
yourself and what you're working on your

2090
01:25:55,198 --> 01:25:59,638
name came up a few times uh while uh in

2091
01:25:57,760 --> 01:26:02,000
the last hour and a half so it's great

2092
01:25:59,639 --> 01:26:05,480
that you showed up yeah man thanks for

2093
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:08,319
having me um sorry I came in late it's a

2094
01:26:05,479 --> 01:26:10,279
had one of those family mornings Break

2095
01:26:08,319 --> 01:26:13,279
Free then all a sudden everyone went off

2096
01:26:10,279 --> 01:26:15,158

01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:22,800
I you know um I had such a great

2121
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:27,158
opportunity to sit on the panel with

2122
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:28,600
Ryan and Mark and Rob on Thursday for uh

2123

01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:33,600
panel and uh I just want to listen you

2125
01:27:31,479 --> 01:27:36,079

gets so high and I just want to you know

2127
01:27:36,079 --> 01:27:40,359
more than chiming in I love I love you

2128
01:27:38,158 --> 01:27:42,479
know learning and I I I thought it was

2129
01:27:40,359 --> 01:27:44,880
really interesting what uh what Ryan was

2130
01:27:42,479 --> 01:27:48,839
talking about earlier about trying to

2131
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:51,800
bring these uh other tpine profiles into

2132
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:53,679
um the Canadian Market I had this really

2133
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:54,960
interesting just on that kind of topic I

2134
01:27:53,679 --> 01:27:56,399
I've been having having this interesting

2135
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:58,118
discussion with a couple Distributors

2136
01:27:56,399 --> 01:28:00,359
here down south southern

2137
01:27:58,118 --> 01:28:03,479
California who say the entire Southern

2138
01:28:00,359 --> 01:28:07,399
California Market doesn't want Jack

2139
01:28:03,479 --> 01:28:09,279
train wreck hay Sage that their tpen

2140
01:28:07,399 --> 01:28:12,198
dominant varieties just don't do well in

2141
01:28:09,279 --> 01:28:14,559
Southern California for whatever reason

2142
01:28:12,198 --> 01:28:17,599
and they do continue to do well in

2143
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:18,880
Northern California and you know there

2144
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:21,800
there's been some people have kind of

2145
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:24,319
made this hypothesis that it has to do

2146
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:27,159
with the nature of the Southern

2147
01:28:24,319 --> 01:28:28,880
California consumer um which might have

2148
01:28:27,158 --> 01:28:31,799
some validity to it you know there's

2149
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:33,639
definitely is a a a different kind of

2150
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:35,600
ethos going on down in Southern

2151
01:28:33,639 --> 01:28:37,480
California but more than anything I

2152
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:39,320
think it's just about exposure you know

2153
01:28:37,479 --> 01:28:41,718
specifically because these tpine

2154
01:28:39,319 --> 01:28:43,679
dominant varieties are they grow well

2155
01:28:41,719 --> 01:28:47,198
they grow really great Under the Sun

2156
01:28:43,679 --> 01:28:48,520
make big beautiful trees um and there's

2157
01:28:47,198 --> 01:28:50,118
a lot of that going on in Northern

2158
01:28:48,520 --> 01:28:52,639
California but very little in Southern

2159
01:28:50,118 --> 01:28:54,639
California so you see what about the

2160
01:28:52,639 --> 01:28:56,960
pears can I ask you about the purples

2161
01:28:54,639 --> 01:28:59,000
like I mean you know grbs and that blue

2162
01:28:56,960 --> 01:29:01,439
dream is in that same family

2163
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:03,359
and you know a lot of these other ones

2164
01:29:01,439 --> 01:29:05,238
are high in mirene how do they sell down

2165
01:29:03,359 --> 01:29:07,639
in Souther in SoCal like I'm wondering

2166
01:29:05,238 --> 01:29:09,479
you is it is it actually that they don't

2167
01:29:07,639 --> 01:29:12,039
like the terpinolene or is it that

2168
01:29:09,479 --> 01:29:15,359
they're only so focused on the beta

2169
01:29:12,039 --> 01:29:17,439
carry off lean like OG Sour Diesel class

2170
01:29:15,359 --> 01:29:19,599
well I I think it has to do with

2171
01:29:17,439 --> 01:29:21,158
exposure like for instance I mean the

2172
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:23,199
the terpinolene thing I think is just

2173
01:29:21,158 --> 01:29:26,118
because there's not enough tpine uh

2174
01:29:23,198 --> 01:29:27,919
dominant varieties on the market because

2175
01:29:26,118 --> 01:29:29,399
um they just traditionally haven't been

2176
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:31,639
grown here but it's the interesting

2177
01:29:29,399 --> 01:29:34,519
point about the purples I mean in the

2178
01:29:31,639 --> 01:29:38,600
late 9s early 2000s Southern Northern

2179
01:29:34,520 --> 01:29:42,280
California Purple Kush purple Urkel uh

2180
01:29:38,600 --> 01:29:43,800
GDP they were everywhere you know and in

2181
01:29:42,279 --> 01:29:45,800
Southern California they weren't and

2182
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:49,560
they still slowly started to trickle in

2183
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:53,079
in the the the um you know the prop 215

2184
01:29:49,560 --> 01:29:56,039
Medical Market but what I found was back

2185
01:29:53,079 --> 01:29:58,118
in the day people just there wasn't this

2186
01:29:56,039 --> 01:30:02,000
open sharing of genetics like there is

2187
01:29:58,118 --> 01:30:04,920
today so it really showed up there first

2188
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:07,920
it bloomed created a market had the

2189
01:30:04,920 --> 01:30:10,480
following and then slowly it trickled

2190
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:12,279
down to Los Angeles and then eventually

2191
01:30:10,479 --> 01:30:13,599
those purple varieties got down here and

2192
01:30:12,279 --> 01:30:15,599
people started working with them and

2193
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:17,159
Crossing them and then they have now you

2194
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:19,920
know I know cultivators who won't grow

2195
01:30:17,158 --> 01:30:21,559
anything unless it's purple that's

2196
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:25,239
that's okay this is all this is all

2197
01:30:21,560 --> 01:30:27,080
we'll grow so um anyway it's yeah it's

2198
01:30:25,238 --> 01:30:29,399
it's just really interesting how you see

2199
01:30:27,079 --> 01:30:32,198
these different markets and there's like

2200
01:30:29,399 --> 01:30:34,399
a legacy of what varieties were first

2201
01:30:32,198 --> 01:30:38,279
introduced into that market that still

2202
01:30:34,399 --> 01:30:40,359
kind of ripples as the market shifts and

2203
01:30:38,279 --> 01:30:41,960
and now we have full access to cultivar

2204
01:30:40,359 --> 01:30:43,920
through the nursery system we can get

2205
01:30:41,960 --> 01:30:47,480
any cultivar that's available up and

2206
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:51,079
down the state um but yeah mve I have a

2207
01:30:47,479 --> 01:30:54,399
quick question when you say purple and

2208
01:30:51,079 --> 01:30:58,439
tpine you know historically uh outside

2209
01:30:54,399 --> 01:31:00,638
of the the Nao ecosystem we don't see

2210
01:30:58,439 --> 01:31:05,000
cultivars at test much higher than right

2211
01:31:00,639 --> 01:31:08,118
at 20 low 20s maybe 20% THC most of the

2212
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:10,158
purples are dip under 20% and I just

2213
01:31:08,118 --> 01:31:14,000
wonder if it's the buying habit of the

2214
01:31:10,158 --> 01:31:16,238
SoCal consumer shooting for that 30% or

2215
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:17,719
more so than and same with the tpine

2216
01:31:16,238 --> 01:31:20,319
dominant lines they they don't they

2217
01:31:17,719 --> 01:31:22,560
don't get at it it takes some breeding

2218
01:31:20,319 --> 01:31:24,719
tricks to get those things up into close

2219
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:27,560
to the 30s and maintain that tpine

2220
01:31:24,719 --> 01:31:28,760
Integrity what do you think about that I

2221
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:30,159
I think that there's something to be

2222
01:31:28,760 --> 01:31:32,560
said for that I think the the purple

2223
01:31:30,158 --> 01:31:35,960
phenomenon has a lot more to do with

2224
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:38,440
marketing you know and and certain very

2225
01:31:35,960 --> 01:31:39,960
successful marketing campaigns behind

2226
01:31:38,439 --> 01:31:42,599
bigger groups that have been able to

2227
01:31:39,960 --> 01:31:44,880
really sell you know I mean it's just

2228
01:31:42,600 --> 01:31:47,480
crazy you know just the other day there

2229
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:50,279
was you know SE junkies did a drop at

2230
01:31:47,479 --> 01:31:53,079
blah blah and and in the valley and

2231
01:31:50,279 --> 01:31:54,759
people were lined up overnight camping

2232
01:31:53,079 --> 01:31:57,600
out waiting

2233
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:58,840
to purchase seeds you know and and I do

2234
01:31:57,600 --> 01:32:00,760
think you know same with the cookie

2235
01:31:58,840 --> 01:32:02,600
store every time a cookie store opens up

2236
01:32:00,760 --> 01:32:06,280
you know there's lines around the block

2237
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:08,320
It's like Star Wars in 1977 you know so

2238
01:32:06,279 --> 01:32:10,118
it's it's far out you know but and

2239
01:32:08,319 --> 01:32:12,439
that's that to me that has so much more

2240
01:32:10,118 --> 01:32:14,880
to do with marketing and how far your

2241
01:32:12,439 --> 01:32:17,399
social media reach goes than it really

2242
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:19,960
is about how desirable those varieties

2243
01:32:17,399 --> 01:32:22,519
are um so and that's the challenge you

2244
01:32:19,960 --> 01:32:24,319
know that the purple's just like like I

2245
01:32:22,520 --> 01:32:25,840
mentioned on the in our our breeding

2246
01:32:24,319 --> 01:32:28,319
panel purple is a beautiful color that

2247
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:31,880
people love you know and in attaching

2248
01:32:28,319 --> 01:32:35,359
that your predisposition to Aromas

2249
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:38,118
colors flavor flavors kind of leads you

2250
01:32:35,359 --> 01:32:40,719
into what varieties you first try as

2251
01:32:38,118 --> 01:32:42,399
soon as they become available and it it

2252
01:32:40,719 --> 01:32:44,439
can kind of grab hold of your

2253
01:32:42,399 --> 01:32:47,319
preferences in a powerful way like me

2254
01:32:44,439 --> 01:32:50,238
for instance I don't really like purple

2255
01:32:47,319 --> 01:32:54,238
varieties but I love the flavor I love

2256
01:32:50,238 --> 01:32:56,279
grape I love purple flavors so you know

2257
01:32:54,238 --> 01:32:58,439
there's like this battle where like I as

2258
01:32:56,279 --> 01:33:00,079
I'm inhaling and I'm enjoying the smoke

2259
01:32:58,439 --> 01:33:02,479
I'm like wow that brings back all these

2260
01:33:00,079 --> 01:33:04,000
memories of all these different these

2261
01:33:02,479 --> 01:33:05,799
different uh you know you remember when

2262
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:09,238
you were a kid purple was a flavor back

2263
01:33:05,800 --> 01:33:11,560
in the 70s you know you got all great it

2264
01:33:09,238 --> 01:33:13,718
was great right yeah know but it often

2265
01:33:11,560 --> 01:33:15,960
was like purple and red and green those

2266
01:33:13,719 --> 01:33:17,359
are your flavors um so it brings back

2267
01:33:15,960 --> 01:33:19,198
all those memories why you said that

2268
01:33:17,359 --> 01:33:21,839
because they're not necessarily the same

2269
01:33:19,198 --> 01:33:23,919
and I that's exactly the question I had

2270
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:27,800
so purple and grape aren't necessarily

2271
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:29,760
the same in cannabis no not at all not

2272
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:31,440
at all not to me at least you know a lot

2273
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:33,320
of the grape the grapey flavors that I

2274
01:33:31,439 --> 01:33:36,879
get come from more like that that tarte

2275
01:33:33,319 --> 01:33:38,759
grape skin you know a lot of a lot of

2276
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:40,600
the stuff with the new purples that

2277
01:33:38,760 --> 01:33:43,079
you're seeing like C junky genetics and

2278
01:33:40,600 --> 01:33:44,880
stuff a lot of the Allure there is that

2279
01:33:43,079 --> 01:33:46,639
through some of the breeding tricks

2280
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:48,639
they've able to kind of turn some of

2281
01:33:46,639 --> 01:33:52,719
those purples by eye more of like a

2282
01:33:48,639 --> 01:33:54,159
gassy limine dominant tpine profile when

2283
01:33:52,719 --> 01:33:56,520
when you're opening those back up or

2284
01:33:54,158 --> 01:33:58,118
you're smelling that it tricks the brain

2285
01:33:56,520 --> 01:34:01,000
um it's not more of like that kind of

2286
01:33:58,118 --> 01:34:02,599
traditional GDP or like uh the grape

2287
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:04,279
Vape which is a little more creamy and

2288
01:34:02,600 --> 01:34:06,880
it's going to remind you more of that

2289
01:34:04,279 --> 01:34:09,559
grape flavor so I I see at least in our

2290
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:10,880
area too um most of the people now

2291
01:34:09,560 --> 01:34:12,960
especially with the purples I mean

2292
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:15,079
traditional Market obviously we know

2293
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:17,760
that's just Unstoppable the ogs are so

2294
01:34:15,079 --> 01:34:19,399
dominant down south um it's starting to

2295
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:21,800
it's starting to come up here but mostly

2296
01:34:19,399 --> 01:34:23,879
now with those purple crosses with more

2297
01:34:21,800 --> 01:34:25,719
of the lening effect little a little

2298
01:34:23,880 --> 01:34:27,760
more of that gas to it that's we're

2299
01:34:25,719 --> 01:34:30,760
definitely seeing a lot of that um in

2300
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:33,199
the lining category in the Cup this year

2301
01:34:30,760 --> 01:34:35,239
um I want to say at least by I think our

2302
01:34:33,198 --> 01:34:37,960
records with SC Labs I think mine's the

2303
01:34:35,238 --> 01:34:39,799
most heavily dominant tpine uh in

2304
01:34:37,960 --> 01:34:42,118
cannabis tested throughout the state

2305
01:34:39,800 --> 01:34:43,800
here and so when we're when we're

2306
01:34:42,118 --> 01:34:46,559
starting to see these different tpine

2307
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:47,920
profiles with the monot Turpin um those

2308
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:49,600
different combinations that's where I'm

2309
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:51,560
starting to see these Trends uh

2310
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:53,920
happening at least by um going tripping

2311
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:56,320
first at the store um it's kind of what

2312
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:58,039
I'm seeing with that here and you just

2313
01:34:56,319 --> 01:35:01,319
reminded me of a question that Mark

2314
01:34:58,039 --> 01:35:05,039
asked like an hour ago about um seasonal

2315
01:35:01,319 --> 01:35:09,679
change in tpine profiles and if you're

2316
01:35:05,039 --> 01:35:11,319
if it you know as you you all know um if

2317
01:35:09,679 --> 01:35:12,800
you're growing in a greenhouse you're

2318
01:35:11,319 --> 01:35:14,439
obviously going to have red shift and

2319
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:16,360
blue shift different types of the Year

2320
01:35:14,439 --> 01:35:17,879
times of the year and that's why a lot

2321
01:35:16,359 --> 01:35:19,279
of people really like those depths

2322
01:35:17,880 --> 01:35:21,400
because they're getting that really

2323
01:35:19,279 --> 01:35:24,559
intense light for 12 hours and then

2324
01:35:21,399 --> 01:35:26,000
getting blacked out and um

2325
01:35:24,560 --> 01:35:28,320
not to spend a lot of time here because

2326
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:32,880
you need data for me to show this but I

2327
01:35:28,319 --> 01:35:36,238
did a a canmed talk a long time ago that

2328
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:38,159
is online and I showed tpine variation

2329
01:35:36,238 --> 01:35:41,118
across multiple harvests in a single

2330
01:35:38,158 --> 01:35:42,960
genotype and you know basically what

2331
01:35:41,118 --> 01:35:46,479
happens if the if the plant is suffering

2332
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:50,359
at all whether it's sunlight stress

2333
01:35:46,479 --> 01:35:52,359
merine starts to take over um it almost

2334
01:35:50,359 --> 01:35:55,198
seems like it's a stress default um

2335
01:35:52,359 --> 01:35:56,319
tarine so

2336
01:35:55,198 --> 01:35:59,000
it's funny you were talking about the

2337
01:35:56,319 --> 01:36:00,279
turpine preservation too um I I was

2338
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,880
actually talking to Alec about this the

2339
01:36:00,279 --> 01:36:03,759
other day that we know there's some

2340
01:36:01,880 --> 01:36:06,480
Farmers up here that actually turned to

2341
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:08,880
harvesting at night uh obviously we know

2342
01:36:06,479 --> 01:36:10,479
some of those tpin the monot Turpin they

2343
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:12,400
they boil they boil down that lowest

2344
01:36:10,479 --> 01:36:14,279
temperature so you're automatically

2345
01:36:12,399 --> 01:36:17,759
losing these tping as they're going off

2346
01:36:14,279 --> 01:36:19,559
so um I'm curious to know kind of you

2347
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:21,760
know if anyone on the panel has has

2348
01:36:19,560 --> 01:36:23,600
heard of other people using utilizing

2349
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:25,560
that trick or technique as far as t

2350
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:28,320
reservations concerned there's a patent

2351
01:36:25,560 --> 01:36:31,800
for harvesting on a full moon on a

2352
01:36:28,319 --> 01:36:35,118
certain day of the month isn't there

2353
01:36:31,800 --> 01:36:37,880
Ryan can't Pat verbalism come on that's

2354
01:36:35,118 --> 01:36:40,719
unfair even if SCU man Sam does it it's

2355
01:36:37,880 --> 01:36:43,920
not fair and it's not cool I'm not

2356
01:36:40,719 --> 01:36:46,920
making this up herbalism I'm I'm not

2357
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:48,199
making this up sure you're not so so on

2358
01:36:46,920 --> 01:36:49,480
the East Coast you know you brought

2359
01:36:48,198 --> 01:36:50,960
something up that's interesting that

2360
01:36:49,479 --> 01:36:52,919
I've paid attention to and I've I've

2361
01:36:50,960 --> 01:36:55,439
been doing some some studies on is is

2362
01:36:52,920 --> 01:36:57,600
our lights a lot Bluer um especially

2363
01:36:55,439 --> 01:36:59,479
when we're growing in in uh green houses

2364
01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:01,440
out here so we are getting very

2365
01:36:59,479 --> 01:37:04,759
different expressions from different

2366
01:37:01,439 --> 01:37:06,799
varietals um and then to someone else's

2367
01:37:04,760 --> 01:37:08,760
point when we're harvesting especially

2368
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:10,920
during the fall it's just naturally

2369
01:37:08,760 --> 01:37:12,760
cooler we're getting different CO2

2370
01:37:10,920 --> 01:37:15,158
levels we're you know different things

2371
01:37:12,760 --> 01:37:18,440
are happening um because of the

2372
01:37:15,158 --> 01:37:19,759
environment and it's changing um the

2373
01:37:18,439 --> 01:37:23,198
Expressions on all these different

2374
01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:27,239
varieties that I see versus a much uh

2375
01:37:23,198 --> 01:37:29,238
you know more uh you know 4200 Spectrum

2376
01:37:27,238 --> 01:37:30,959
or something like that so it's we're

2377
01:37:29,238 --> 01:37:33,479
we're getting a different expression

2378
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:35,158
from the chines and and also the canono

2379
01:37:33,479 --> 01:37:37,198
expression and then all the way through

2380
01:37:35,158 --> 01:37:40,279
Harvest we're able to keep things really

2381
01:37:37,198 --> 01:37:41,919
cool a certain time of year you know if

2382
01:37:40,279 --> 01:37:43,319
we do light depth usually June's a

2383
01:37:41,920 --> 01:37:47,199
little bit different for us out here

2384
01:37:43,319 --> 01:37:50,158
where it's dry but it's it's still um it

2385
01:37:47,198 --> 01:37:52,000
gets hot so um it it's just different

2386
01:37:50,158 --> 01:37:54,238
but but absolutely over the years the

2387
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:56,359
fall has been a key placee for doing

2388
01:37:54,238 --> 01:37:59,158
those chem and ogs and sours that's

2389
01:37:56,359 --> 01:38:02,279
really where and I think why our sour

2390
01:37:59,158 --> 01:38:03,879
when we did them well um during the fall

2391
01:38:02,279 --> 01:38:06,279
they just they really were a great

2392
01:38:03,880 --> 01:38:08,159
expression of those particular

2393
01:38:06,279 --> 01:38:10,198
varietals just goes to show how

2394
01:38:08,158 --> 01:38:13,479
important environment is

2395
01:38:10,198 --> 01:38:15,759
Right absolutely I was gonna say thing

2396
01:38:13,479 --> 01:38:17,799
because we're also talking about

2397
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:19,599
microbiology because in the morning

2398
01:38:17,800 --> 01:38:22,679
there's a tremendous amount of

2399
01:38:19,599 --> 01:38:25,000
microbiology in the air in the early

2400
01:38:22,679 --> 01:38:26,960
morning and this is why ancient

2401
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:29,279
practices of when you're trying to

2402
01:38:26,960 --> 01:38:32,158
collect sort of those volatile oils of

2403
01:38:29,279 --> 01:38:35,198
any types of herbs and ancient herbology

2404
01:38:32,158 --> 01:38:38,319
tells you you know before the Sun Peaks

2405
01:38:35,198 --> 01:38:40,919
on the horizon is is when anything

2406
01:38:38,319 --> 01:38:43,639
should be picked for its aromatic

2407
01:38:40,920 --> 01:38:46,118
effects and that just goes back I I mean

2408
01:38:43,639 --> 01:38:47,279
I think thousands of years even 5,000

2409
01:38:46,118 --> 01:38:50,519
years in

2410
01:38:47,279 --> 01:38:52,479
Chinese I don't know about that but um

2411
01:38:50,520 --> 01:38:55,639
it's a you know when we're talking about

2412
01:38:52,479 --> 01:38:58,158
curing we're talking about microbiology

2413
01:38:55,639 --> 01:39:03,319
and it is so important I loved you know

2414
01:38:58,158 --> 01:39:05,000
that cool long dry cure is so helpful

2415
01:39:03,319 --> 01:39:07,198
for the stabilization of the

2416
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:09,599
microbiology during that time and I and

2417
01:39:07,198 --> 01:39:12,759
I think that there's a really big role

2418
01:39:09,599 --> 01:39:15,840
in uh tpine preservation and

2419
01:39:12,760 --> 01:39:18,159
microbiology so it it's it's sort of a

2420
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:20,639
an unknown it's another fractal

2421
01:39:18,158 --> 01:39:25,319
immersion yeah another fractal that we

2422
01:39:20,639 --> 01:39:27,359
have to look at changing the same I

2423
01:39:25,319 --> 01:39:30,079
couldn't agree more it's like and it's

2424
01:39:27,359 --> 01:39:31,839
also you tie the chemistry in right like

2425
01:39:30,079 --> 01:39:34,399
it at cooler temperatures most of those

2426
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:37,239
aromatic plants have tricomes tricomes

2427
01:39:34,399 --> 01:39:39,879
are made out of waxes and fatty acids

2428
01:39:37,238 --> 01:39:42,519
which when they're colder are stronger

2429
01:39:39,880 --> 01:39:44,079
and hold the aromatics in better and

2430
01:39:42,520 --> 01:39:46,199
then when the sun's out you have the

2431
01:39:44,079 --> 01:39:48,840
heat hitting the molecules causing them

2432
01:39:46,198 --> 01:39:51,238
to turn into a gas and then it's gone

2433
01:39:48,840 --> 01:39:53,880
and I found this patent by the way it's

2434
01:39:51,238 --> 01:39:56,198
uh if you want the patent number

2435
01:39:53,880 --> 01:39:57,880
the the actual title is about moon

2436
01:39:56,198 --> 01:40:00,279
phases it's

2437
01:39:57,880 --> 01:40:02,480
um very interesting would you guys like

2438
01:40:00,279 --> 01:40:04,599
to look it up or do you care yeah yeah

2439
01:40:02,479 --> 01:40:06,479
put it in put it into the chat and I'll

2440
01:40:04,599 --> 01:40:08,000
also I'll put it into the comment

2441
01:40:06,479 --> 01:40:11,118
section I think you know getting into

2442
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:13,840
the the microbi biology of the soil

2443
01:40:11,118 --> 01:40:16,039
leads perfectly into an introduction uh

2444
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:18,199
with Peter and you know a bunch of us

2445
01:40:16,039 --> 01:40:20,880
have been going deep down the rabbit

2446
01:40:18,198 --> 01:40:23,399
hole on clubhouse the last couple of

2447
01:40:20,880 --> 01:40:24,760
days uh into all of these things that

2448
01:40:23,399 --> 01:40:28,158
we're talking about right now and this

2449
01:40:24,760 --> 01:40:31,320
is a perfect time to bring in the

2450
01:40:28,158 --> 01:40:33,799
microbiology so welcome Peter how are

2451
01:40:31,319 --> 01:40:37,319
you my friend cool Marcus thanks so much

2452
01:40:33,800 --> 01:40:39,599
for having me um it's uh great to be in

2453
01:40:37,319 --> 01:40:41,319
this room with all of you Minds you guys

2454
01:40:39,599 --> 01:40:43,159
uh just sitting here listening man the

2455
01:40:41,319 --> 01:40:46,279
the minds in here are beautiful and I'm

2456
01:40:43,158 --> 01:40:48,039
so just like humbled to be in the same

2457
01:40:46,279 --> 01:40:50,639
room as you guys and your industry

2458
01:40:48,039 --> 01:40:52,760
knowledge it's it's amazing I'm like a

2459
01:40:50,639 --> 01:40:57,000
listener you know in the audience just

2460
01:40:52,760 --> 01:40:59,440
blown away by by you guys so um but um

2461
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:00,679
yeah Jeremy and Mojave and I have been

2462
01:40:59,439 --> 01:41:04,598
having some really interesting

2463
01:41:00,679 --> 01:41:06,199
conversations on clubhouse lately and

2464
01:41:04,599 --> 01:41:07,840
one of the things that I thought was

2465
01:41:06,198 --> 01:41:09,479
cool that we could bring up was the

2466
01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:12,679
concept of

2467
01:41:09,479 --> 01:41:16,439
saites which sapres are a type of

2468
01:41:12,679 --> 01:41:20,399
organism which are so important uh for

2469
01:41:16,439 --> 01:41:23,319
turpine production and canono production

2470
01:41:20,399 --> 01:41:27,079
um they're like you know the Frontline

2471
01:41:23,319 --> 01:41:30,079
workers of the uh of the work that needs

2472
01:41:27,079 --> 01:41:32,279
to be done in the rizosphere to actually

2473
01:41:30,079 --> 01:41:35,079
increase uh what's called Trace nutrient

2474
01:41:32,279 --> 01:41:36,479
absorption right so what we're what we

2475
01:41:35,079 --> 01:41:40,000
have found and I'll give you guys just a

2476
01:41:36,479 --> 01:41:43,959
little bit of background is uh in

2477
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:46,880
2019 uh our group consulted for 162 uh

2478
01:41:43,960 --> 01:41:49,520
largescale hemp farmers and what we

2479
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:52,560
found was that the trace nutrient

2480
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:53,920
absorption your coppers your zinc your

2481
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:56,119
your borons

2482
01:41:53,920 --> 01:41:58,719
were like the physics or or the

2483
01:41:56,118 --> 01:42:01,198
foundation of of the necessary

2484
01:41:58,719 --> 01:42:04,000
absorption in that risos spere to build

2485
01:42:01,198 --> 01:42:08,359
the different types of Tarpin within the

2486
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:10,319
profile so it was uh seen by us that the

2487
01:42:08,359 --> 01:42:13,479
Growers that had a biologically active

2488
01:42:10,319 --> 01:42:16,399
system with a with a good amount of of

2489
01:42:13,479 --> 01:42:18,919
of sapric organisms and I I can go into

2490
01:42:16,399 --> 01:42:19,879
what those are a little bit more but

2491
01:42:18,920 --> 01:42:23,719
those

2492
01:42:19,880 --> 01:42:26,719
Farmers uh were getting like 25 types of

2493
01:42:23,719 --> 01:42:30,319
tpin in their profile and then the The

2494
01:42:26,719 --> 01:42:33,679
Growers that had maybe five types of of

2495
01:42:30,319 --> 01:42:35,279
good sapri organisms or I'm sorry um

2496
01:42:33,679 --> 01:42:37,359
that had low amounts of saprophytic

2497
01:42:35,279 --> 01:42:39,920
organisms were getting maybe five or six

2498
01:42:37,359 --> 01:42:41,799
types of tpin and they were all really

2499
01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:43,840
high so you'd have like four or five

2500
01:42:41,800 --> 01:42:46,679
spikes in the profile but then the

2501
01:42:43,840 --> 01:42:49,199
biologically active soil would have like

2502
01:42:46,679 --> 01:42:51,639
25 different types of tpin but they were

2503
01:42:49,198 --> 01:42:54,439
more balanced so you would have like 15

2504
01:42:51,639 --> 01:42:55,880
types that were all over like point one

2505
01:42:54,439 --> 01:42:58,799
versus you

2506
01:42:55,880 --> 01:43:01,400
know the the uh the soils that didn't

2507
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:02,599
didn't have the sacrifice and so one of

2508
01:43:01,399 --> 01:43:06,679
the one of the things that I thought

2509
01:43:02,599 --> 01:43:10,119
would be cool to talk about today is the

2510
01:43:06,679 --> 01:43:13,920
um the uh the way that sapres can

2511
01:43:10,118 --> 01:43:17,519
actually help with powdery and dowy

2512
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:19,199
M so this is this is just a cool concept

2513
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:24,080
and it's just part of nature it's the

2514
01:43:19,198 --> 01:43:27,319
way that it that it works um and

2515
01:43:24,079 --> 01:43:29,198
so a sapry is a living organism right

2516
01:43:27,319 --> 01:43:31,279
and and to understand powdery and dowy

2517
01:43:29,198 --> 01:43:32,919
mildew what you kind of want to

2518
01:43:31,279 --> 01:43:36,359
understand is is maybe where it comes

2519
01:43:32,920 --> 01:43:37,960
from so in in the soil in all organic

2520
01:43:36,359 --> 01:43:40,960
material there's this there's this

2521
01:43:37,960 --> 01:43:42,639
little tiny ball it's called an O Spore

2522
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:44,439
and it's like a little bowling ball it's

2523
01:43:42,639 --> 01:43:46,118
super small it's microscopic so you got

2524
01:43:44,439 --> 01:43:48,839
to take your mind and think really tiny

2525
01:43:46,118 --> 01:43:52,158
right now so this little o Spore is like

2526
01:43:48,840 --> 01:43:55,000
a bowling ball uh particle inside the

2527
01:43:52,158 --> 01:43:57,399
soil and inside of it lives this

2528
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:59,399
organism called peronospora which is

2529
01:43:57,399 --> 01:44:00,359
another which is the scientific name for

2530
01:43:59,399 --> 01:44:03,439
Downey

2531
01:44:00,359 --> 01:44:05,399
Milo so no amount of chemicals like if

2532
01:44:03,439 --> 01:44:07,759
you hit it with methyl bromide or a

2533
01:44:05,399 --> 01:44:11,960
systemic fungicide or whatever is going

2534
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:14,199
to destroy this little oo Spore so it's

2535
01:44:11,960 --> 01:44:18,719
very hard to to to

2536
01:44:14,198 --> 01:44:21,000
destroy and once you get the correct uh

2537
01:44:18,719 --> 01:44:24,239
physics and the and the correct uh

2538
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:26,840
temperature and the correct um moisture

2539
01:44:24,238 --> 01:44:27,598
levels that little o Spore in the soil

2540
01:44:26,840 --> 01:44:31,079
it

2541
01:44:27,599 --> 01:44:33,319
cracks and out comes this this this

2542
01:44:31,079 --> 01:44:35,079
peronospora this dowy mildo and it

2543
01:44:33,319 --> 01:44:38,118
begins to just kind of colonize the

2544
01:44:35,079 --> 01:44:40,279
carbon in the soil right so what's

2545
01:44:38,118 --> 01:44:43,279
pretty cool is if you have an abundance

2546
01:44:40,279 --> 01:44:46,238
of these types of of bacteria and fungi

2547
01:44:43,279 --> 01:44:48,079
called called saprophytic organisms what

2548
01:44:46,238 --> 01:44:50,839
they'll do is they can actually grow on

2549
01:44:48,079 --> 01:44:53,158
all the carbon and then when that uh

2550
01:44:50,840 --> 01:44:55,719
that disease that soil born pathogen

2551
01:44:53,158 --> 01:44:58,399
begins to to colonize and and it has the

2552
01:44:55,719 --> 01:45:01,079
perfect environment it doesn't have any

2553
01:44:58,399 --> 01:45:03,079
space because there's all these these

2554
01:45:01,079 --> 01:45:05,079
good guys that are on all the rest of

2555
01:45:03,079 --> 01:45:06,359
the carbon that are basically like

2556
01:45:05,079 --> 01:45:08,880
having a party on there and they're

2557
01:45:06,359 --> 01:45:10,719
doing a really special form of work so

2558
01:45:08,880 --> 01:45:12,480
what happens is the bad you know the

2559
01:45:10,719 --> 01:45:14,560
path he's not a bad guy but he's a

2560
01:45:12,479 --> 01:45:18,359
pathogen who just wants to eat to

2561
01:45:14,560 --> 01:45:20,679
survive right and take and and and so

2562
01:45:18,359 --> 01:45:22,519
what this little guy uh does is he tries

2563
01:45:20,679 --> 01:45:25,158
to get into the party on the carbon and

2564
01:45:22,520 --> 01:45:27,920
there's no room for him to jump in there

2565
01:45:25,158 --> 01:45:30,279
so so biologically speaking he can't

2566
01:45:27,920 --> 01:45:33,319
gain traction he can't gain confidency

2567
01:45:30,279 --> 01:45:35,479
now normally what paranos would do is it

2568
01:45:33,319 --> 01:45:37,399
would actually colonize the carbon and

2569
01:45:35,479 --> 01:45:39,759
then it would actually colonize the the

2570
01:45:37,399 --> 01:45:42,719
root and there's another cool little

2571
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:44,520
thing in in the soil it's a little worm

2572
01:45:42,719 --> 01:45:47,198
and sometimes those little worms called

2573
01:45:44,520 --> 01:45:49,960
nematodes can actually make holes in the

2574
01:45:47,198 --> 01:45:51,519
roots so now what happens is the

2575
01:45:49,960 --> 01:45:53,359
peronospora that came out of that little

2576
01:45:51,520 --> 01:45:55,880
bowling ball will actually go into the

2577
01:45:53,359 --> 01:45:57,839
plant's vascular system it'll Cruise in

2578
01:45:55,880 --> 01:45:59,560
through that hole and it'll and it'll

2579
01:45:57,840 --> 01:46:02,400
get into the glucose and the sugar and

2580
01:45:59,560 --> 01:46:03,840
it just has a a field B it's like oh man

2581
01:46:02,399 --> 01:46:06,679
there's all this food and delicious

2582
01:46:03,840 --> 01:46:10,159
stuff so now it's traveling through the

2583
01:46:06,679 --> 01:46:13,359
plant and guess what happens so in a in

2584
01:46:10,158 --> 01:46:15,759
a in a nutrient deficient plant uh

2585
01:46:13,359 --> 01:46:18,920
system what ends up happening is you get

2586
01:46:15,760 --> 01:46:21,400
this this like this area where there's a

2587
01:46:18,920 --> 01:46:23,920
lack of Trace nutrients so you don't

2588
01:46:21,399 --> 01:46:26,679
have your your boron your zincs your

2589
01:46:23,920 --> 01:46:29,279
coppers all these amazing you know um

2590
01:46:26,679 --> 01:46:31,719
minerals that the plant needs to to

2591
01:46:29,279 --> 01:46:34,238
Really you know produce its full genetic

2592
01:46:31,719 --> 01:46:37,158
expression and that's where the the the

2593
01:46:34,238 --> 01:46:39,319
peronospora will begin to eat and then

2594
01:46:37,158 --> 01:46:41,879
what happens is is it will colonize so

2595
01:46:39,319 --> 01:46:43,960
much that it gets on the top of the soil

2596
01:46:41,880 --> 01:46:47,118
um and and then like in a natural

2597
01:46:43,960 --> 01:46:49,599
environment a big wind comes or or a

2598
01:46:47,118 --> 01:46:52,279
droplet of rain comes and that can

2599
01:46:49,599 --> 01:46:54,599
spread it to the all the other plants

2600
01:46:52,279 --> 01:46:58,039
right so this is how this guy gains

2601
01:46:54,599 --> 01:47:00,440
traction and so what we do as Farmers as

2602
01:46:58,039 --> 01:47:02,880
Growers is we actually you know will

2603
01:47:00,439 --> 01:47:06,079
just figure out organic oils or

2604
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:07,800
different things or hopefully um or

2605
01:47:06,079 --> 01:47:10,158
we'll hit it with something called a

2606
01:47:07,800 --> 01:47:12,119
systemic fungicide now systemic

2607
01:47:10,158 --> 01:47:14,279
fungicides go into the vascular system

2608
01:47:12,118 --> 01:47:16,799
of the plant and into our food so what

2609
01:47:14,279 --> 01:47:18,759
ends up happening is this this uh

2610
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:21,279
chlorinated hydrocarbon just kills not

2611
01:47:18,760 --> 01:47:24,000
only the peronospora but it kills uh all

2612
01:47:21,279 --> 01:47:28,840
the beneficial bacteria that is so

2613
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:33,719
crucial to tpine uh uh synthes enzyme

2614
01:47:28,840 --> 01:47:38,639
CBD THC synthes enzyme so so we got to

2615
01:47:33,719 --> 01:47:40,719
go back to the the the the the saites so

2616
01:47:38,639 --> 01:47:43,480
this is what's so cool about certain

2617
01:47:40,719 --> 01:47:47,599
saprophytic organisms so the definition

2618
01:47:43,479 --> 01:47:50,919
of a sapry is is a organism that eats

2619
01:47:47,599 --> 01:47:52,840
and digests carbon so think about like

2620
01:47:50,920 --> 01:47:54,359
like composting right when we're growing

2621
01:47:52,840 --> 01:47:57,039
growing organically the first thing that

2622
01:47:54,359 --> 01:47:59,279
any organic farmer does is he um

2623
01:47:57,039 --> 01:48:01,599
composts his soil for two to three years

2624
01:47:59,279 --> 01:48:03,359
to get that soil biologically to a point

2625
01:48:01,599 --> 01:48:09,159
of Competency that it can actually have

2626
01:48:03,359 --> 01:48:11,839
these natural um efficacies right so we

2627
01:48:09,158 --> 01:48:14,000
don't have enough compost to compost a

2628
01:48:11,840 --> 01:48:16,279
100 million Acres we just don't have the

2629
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:19,399
resources the material but we do have

2630
01:48:16,279 --> 01:48:22,198
enough beneficial bacteria we do have

2631
01:48:19,399 --> 01:48:24,198
enough uh sapres in the form of fungi

2632
01:48:22,198 --> 01:48:25,839
which are also mushrooms right which is

2633
01:48:24,198 --> 01:48:27,678
a big a big trending thing right now

2634
01:48:25,840 --> 01:48:30,360
people are really connecting with with

2635
01:48:27,679 --> 01:48:32,880
mushrooms and starting to explore that

2636
01:48:30,359 --> 01:48:35,679
um which is fantastic it's it's it's

2637
01:48:32,880 --> 01:48:40,199
it's it's this it's this Unseen World of

2638
01:48:35,679 --> 01:48:42,719
life that is the defining factor in

2639
01:48:40,198 --> 01:48:47,118
quantifying quality and and producing

2640
01:48:42,719 --> 01:48:48,880
quality I should say so um so one of the

2641
01:48:47,118 --> 01:48:52,319
cool things about saites and then I'll

2642
01:48:48,880 --> 01:48:54,118
I'll shut up but uh the um the cool

2643
01:48:52,319 --> 01:48:56,719
thing about sapric is they have these

2644
01:48:54,118 --> 01:48:58,559
two main objectives right so one of the

2645
01:48:56,719 --> 01:49:00,439
first things that they do when they

2646
01:48:58,560 --> 01:49:04,119
first get into the soil which is which

2647
01:49:00,439 --> 01:49:08,118
is awesome is they will um begin to like

2648
01:49:04,118 --> 01:49:11,079
decompose old carbon so like a plant is

2649
01:49:08,118 --> 01:49:14,399
trying to place carbon into the soil

2650
01:49:11,079 --> 01:49:16,679
right with its roots so as a plant grows

2651
01:49:14,399 --> 01:49:19,000
it deposits its its roots in the form of

2652
01:49:16,679 --> 01:49:22,399
carbon into the soil and these

2653
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:26,479
saprophytes will actually go on it and

2654
01:49:22,399 --> 01:49:29,279
they be begin to um to live in in the

2655
01:49:26,479 --> 01:49:31,279
symbiotic relationship with the root

2656
01:49:29,279 --> 01:49:33,559
exit dates that the plant is producing

2657
01:49:31,279 --> 01:49:35,479
in the form of sugars and carbohydrates

2658
01:49:33,560 --> 01:49:37,719
so think of it as like the root is

2659
01:49:35,479 --> 01:49:39,399
producing like a bead of sweat you know

2660
01:49:37,719 --> 01:49:42,399
it's like this it's it's like this

2661
01:49:39,399 --> 01:49:44,960
little bead of sweat and the sapres love

2662
01:49:42,399 --> 01:49:47,079
to eat sugars and carbohydrates you know

2663
01:49:44,960 --> 01:49:48,840
and so do my kids they they love the

2664
01:49:47,079 --> 01:49:50,840
donuts sometimes and I give it to them

2665
01:49:48,840 --> 01:49:53,039
you know we try by organic point of the

2666
01:49:50,840 --> 01:49:55,719
riseof fasi cycle that's the point of

2667
01:49:53,039 --> 01:49:58,479
the riseof fasy cycle where the Endo

2668
01:49:55,719 --> 01:50:00,719
fidic fungi and bacteria enter into the

2669
01:49:58,479 --> 01:50:04,439
roots and enter into the plants so it's

2670
01:50:00,719 --> 01:50:08,439
not just saprophytic fungi right the

2671
01:50:04,439 --> 01:50:11,079
whole entire totally nod factors

2672
01:50:08,439 --> 01:50:13,638
right I'm trying to just give it a give

2673
01:50:11,079 --> 01:50:15,319
it an overview for the audience to to to

2674
01:50:13,639 --> 01:50:18,520
give it kind of like there's so much

2675
01:50:15,319 --> 01:50:20,719
diversity right so much abely yeah and I

2676
01:50:18,520 --> 01:50:22,679
think that we can bring it back really

2677
01:50:20,719 --> 01:50:24,880
easily to understanding the mic

2678
01:50:22,679 --> 01:50:28,118
microbiome of the plant is really no

2679
01:50:24,880 --> 01:50:30,400
different than the human microbiome so

2680
01:50:28,118 --> 01:50:32,118
what we're feeding the soil is the same

2681
01:50:30,399 --> 01:50:34,679
as what we're feeding our human

2682
01:50:32,118 --> 01:50:37,118
digestive system so whenever we're out

2683
01:50:34,679 --> 01:50:40,920
of balance with say like an

2684
01:50:37,118 --> 01:50:43,719
oyes or some other type of a yeast uh

2685
01:50:40,920 --> 01:50:46,158
Leaf eeding mildew we have a yeast

2686
01:50:43,719 --> 01:50:48,399
infection the plant has a yeast

2687
01:50:46,158 --> 01:50:51,559
infection it's absolutely no different

2688
01:50:48,399 --> 01:50:53,719
than if our own microbiome is totally

2689
01:50:51,560 --> 01:50:57,920
out of balance with a tremendous amount

2690
01:50:53,719 --> 01:51:00,198
of yeast or or different types of of um

2691
01:50:57,920 --> 01:51:03,118
aggressive microorganisms that will eat

2692
01:51:00,198 --> 01:51:06,198
up our beneficial so having a really

2693
01:51:03,118 --> 01:51:08,319
well-rounded diet that has a lot you

2694
01:51:06,198 --> 01:51:11,279
know doesn't have sugars that isn't

2695
01:51:08,319 --> 01:51:13,639
feeding a lot of those yeast and mildew

2696
01:51:11,279 --> 01:51:16,599
is the same way that we need to look at

2697
01:51:13,639 --> 01:51:19,520
our soils so when our soils have a

2698
01:51:16,599 --> 01:51:22,000
tremendous amount of carbon then we are

2699
01:51:19,520 --> 01:51:24,000
actually drawing and and composting

2700
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:26,479
carbon like Peter was just talking about

2701
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:30,279
and satic fungi and sapric fungi then

2702
01:51:26,479 --> 01:51:33,479
we're also drawing a myriad of different

2703
01:51:30,279 --> 01:51:36,158
types of fungi which is a a huge

2704
01:51:33,479 --> 01:51:38,039
decomposing raw materials that's why

2705
01:51:36,158 --> 01:51:41,198
we're raw materials Farmers because you

2706
01:51:38,039 --> 01:51:44,039
can't stop goodness from coming in yeah

2707
01:51:41,198 --> 01:51:48,759
and I think that once you you have this

2708
01:51:44,039 --> 01:51:53,399
sort of balanced soil then you have a

2709
01:51:48,760 --> 01:51:54,920
that that beautiful clean

2710
01:51:53,399 --> 01:51:57,719
balanced

2711
01:51:54,920 --> 01:52:00,199
endid system the same as the microbiome

2712
01:51:57,719 --> 01:52:02,480
so it's high fungal soil is what you're

2713
01:52:00,198 --> 01:52:04,158
saying we're agreeing with you yeah and

2714
01:52:02,479 --> 01:52:06,399
as you're talking Peter it's awesome

2715
01:52:04,158 --> 01:52:08,799
because I'm always drawing which which I

2716
01:52:06,399 --> 01:52:10,960
always do as my background in human

2717
01:52:08,800 --> 01:52:13,320
health I'm always drawing the two to

2718
01:52:10,960 --> 01:52:15,439
human health and soil and plant and

2719
01:52:13,319 --> 01:52:19,198
human health and and how they're so

2720
01:52:15,439 --> 01:52:21,078
incredibly related what you so spot on

2721
01:52:19,198 --> 01:52:22,960
what you said so spot on I love

2722
01:52:21,078 --> 01:52:24,319
everything you're you're putting out so

2723
01:52:22,960 --> 01:52:26,800
yeah you guys are

2724
01:52:24,319 --> 01:52:29,078
amazing uh in what you're doing I'm I'm

2725
01:52:26,800 --> 01:52:30,760
so appreciative of your permaculture of

2726
01:52:29,078 --> 01:52:32,759
the way that you certify people like

2727
01:52:30,760 --> 01:52:34,440
it's beautiful I'm I'm humbled to be on

2728
01:52:32,760 --> 01:52:36,920
the same stage as you guys you guys are

2729
01:52:34,439 --> 01:52:40,879
that amazing to me like beautiful what

2730
01:52:36,920 --> 01:52:42,319
you're doing um true feel the Sameer I

2731
01:52:40,880 --> 01:52:44,440
love what you putting down it's so

2732
01:52:42,319 --> 01:52:46,599
incredibly important for people to be

2733
01:52:44,439 --> 01:52:48,559
able to get this information everyone on

2734
01:52:46,599 --> 01:52:50,360
this panel is amazing this panel today

2735
01:52:48,560 --> 01:52:52,079
has been awesome like totally

2736
01:52:50,359 --> 01:52:54,279
mind-blowing thank you guys so much

2737
01:52:52,078 --> 01:52:56,000
every single person on here I've smoked

2738
01:52:54,279 --> 01:52:59,000
so many bong hits sitting here just

2739
01:52:56,000 --> 01:53:01,679
blown away this has really re-sparked

2740
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:03,198
something in me thank you so much bong

2741
01:53:01,679 --> 01:53:05,840
rip mother

2742
01:53:03,198 --> 01:53:07,479
lovers Peter if I may there's also one

2743
01:53:05,840 --> 01:53:09,000
thing that I think is a really important

2744
01:53:07,479 --> 01:53:10,359
implication of what you're bringing up

2745
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:13,840
and what Josh and Kelly were just

2746
01:53:10,359 --> 01:53:16,880
emphasizing yes Jeremy right now we we

2747
01:53:13,840 --> 01:53:18,920
have this massive industry scaling with

2748
01:53:16,880 --> 01:53:21,880
Consultants around the world telling

2749
01:53:18,920 --> 01:53:24,319
people with money that the only reliable

2750
01:53:21,880 --> 01:53:27,000
production model is a mineral salt

2751
01:53:24,319 --> 01:53:29,359
program under HID lights with this one

2752
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:30,960
siiz fits all crap one of the exciting

2753
01:53:29,359 --> 01:53:32,719
things that I have fought for for a long

2754
01:53:30,960 --> 01:53:35,399
time and I'm really proud of in Oregon

2755
01:53:32,719 --> 01:53:37,920
is that reality is I think that the

2756
01:53:35,399 --> 01:53:41,198
Organic Crop Production model finally we

2757
01:53:37,920 --> 01:53:44,399
can point to like the rale crop trials

2758
01:53:41,198 --> 01:53:47,039
has been more successful in out yielding

2759
01:53:44,399 --> 01:53:49,039
out consistent or more consistently

2760
01:53:47,039 --> 01:53:51,399
yielding and of course from all the

2761
01:53:49,039 --> 01:53:53,118
qualitative attributes performing as a

2762
01:53:51,399 --> 01:53:55,839
production model on the whole and

2763
01:53:53,118 --> 01:53:58,118
absolutely convinced it's because of

2764
01:53:55,840 --> 01:54:00,000
belonging to biology in an intentional

2765
01:53:58,118 --> 01:54:02,679
way participating with Biology

2766
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:04,439
encouraging biology I can't pretend to

2767
01:54:02,679 --> 01:54:06,480
understand all of the biological

2768
01:54:04,439 --> 01:54:08,719
elements and in fact I think soil doctor

2769
01:54:06,479 --> 01:54:10,238
does some great talks about that where

2770
01:54:08,719 --> 01:54:12,800
you know we look at the various kind of

2771
01:54:10,238 --> 01:54:14,678
biological assays and the complexity of

2772
01:54:12,800 --> 01:54:16,840
being able to really understand those

2773
01:54:14,679 --> 01:54:19,158
Dynamics and it gets incredibly complex

2774
01:54:16,840 --> 01:54:21,639
it reminds me of Ryan's hairball earlier

2775
01:54:19,158 --> 01:54:24,158
but this notion that we can create the

2776
01:54:21,639 --> 01:54:26,078
conditions by which biology can flourish

2777
01:54:24,158 --> 01:54:29,279
and I'm so excited about whether it's

2778
01:54:26,078 --> 01:54:32,359
rise ofy or this kind of overall sort of

2779
01:54:29,279 --> 01:54:34,519
um Shield against like a bios Shield all

2780
01:54:32,359 --> 01:54:37,399
pathogen pressure I am convinced one of

2781
01:54:34,520 --> 01:54:39,320
the reasons that proof has only 6,500

2782
01:54:37,399 --> 01:54:41,598
square foot of canopy and many of the

2783
01:54:39,319 --> 01:54:43,880
other tier 2 folks are like 10,000 and

2784
01:54:41,599 --> 01:54:46,520
we're producing in most cases two to

2785
01:54:43,880 --> 01:54:48,639
three times the output it is simply

2786
01:54:46,520 --> 01:54:50,840
about working with Organic cultures and

2787
01:54:48,639 --> 01:54:52,599
that the organic cultures you know are

2788
01:54:50,840 --> 01:54:54,199
absolutely in addition to all those

2789
01:54:52,599 --> 01:54:56,480
qualitative attributes you mentioned so

2790
01:54:54,198 --> 01:54:59,799
eloquently Peter in my data I always

2791
01:54:56,479 --> 01:55:01,638
show more chemo diversity in a profile

2792
01:54:59,800 --> 01:55:03,760
and whereas when I contrast that to the

2793
01:55:01,639 --> 01:55:06,159
mineral salt products it's more chemo

2794
01:55:03,760 --> 01:55:08,440
intensity but it's a far less desirable

2795
01:55:06,158 --> 01:55:10,479
product I just I would never choose that

2796
01:55:08,439 --> 01:55:13,198
product if I have the options from a

2797
01:55:10,479 --> 01:55:15,598
sensory perspective from a physiological

2798
01:55:13,198 --> 01:55:18,039
perspective from a spiritual perspective

2799
01:55:15,599 --> 01:55:20,078
but yet we continue to see these scaled

2800
01:55:18,039 --> 01:55:21,719
Gardens moving forward without any of

2801
01:55:20,078 --> 01:55:24,078
this awareness so it's one of my

2802
01:55:21,719 --> 01:55:26,118
missions to be able to quantify and

2803
01:55:24,078 --> 01:55:28,319
characterize this sort of production

2804
01:55:26,118 --> 01:55:30,598
performance to simply be able to help

2805
01:55:28,319 --> 01:55:33,359
people who are not as amazing as all of

2806
01:55:30,599 --> 01:55:36,159
the humans on this panel uh who are new

2807
01:55:33,359 --> 01:55:38,078
and fearful of losing capital and

2808
01:55:36,158 --> 01:55:40,719
listening to the kind of prevailing

2809
01:55:38,078 --> 01:55:42,920
ethos of all the existing Consultants

2810
01:55:40,719 --> 01:55:44,880
that actually in fact obviously the only

2811
01:55:42,920 --> 01:55:47,039
way forward is to really create these

2812
01:55:44,880 --> 01:55:49,679
hyper biological systems and to tend

2813
01:55:47,039 --> 01:55:51,238
that with care anyways I so love every

2814
01:55:49,679 --> 01:55:53,399
it's been such a joy to communicate with

2815
01:55:51,238 --> 01:55:57,279
you over the last days by the way

2816
01:55:53,399 --> 01:56:00,439
well I think we could really easily just

2817
01:55:57,279 --> 01:56:03,158
ask the plant like if we bring the plant

2818
01:56:00,439 --> 01:56:05,399
into this conversation so often exactly

2819
01:56:03,158 --> 01:56:07,638
what you were just saying Jeremy is that

2820
01:56:05,399 --> 01:56:09,238
we're talking about mergers and wagers

2821
01:56:07,639 --> 01:56:13,400
and all of these different signed

2822
01:56:09,238 --> 01:56:15,559
documents and and Sops and IPS and

2823
01:56:13,399 --> 01:56:18,519
everything that's got a letter and

2824
01:56:15,560 --> 01:56:21,360
sometimes it's just so simple to pull up

2825
01:56:18,520 --> 01:56:24,480
a chair for the plant and ask her how

2826
01:56:21,359 --> 01:56:27,598
she would like to be grown ask her you

2827
01:56:24,479 --> 01:56:31,198
know how is it that that she would like

2828
01:56:27,599 --> 01:56:33,360
to to to have medicine Prevail inside of

2829
01:56:31,198 --> 01:56:35,638
humans on the planet in the relationship

2830
01:56:33,359 --> 01:56:37,078
that she would like to have with humans

2831
01:56:35,639 --> 01:56:39,400
and of course she's going to say that

2832
01:56:37,078 --> 01:56:42,238
she would love to grow outside under

2833
01:56:39,399 --> 01:56:44,198
polyculture in deep soil what plant

2834
01:56:42,238 --> 01:56:47,559
wouldn't want to say that and I think

2835
01:56:44,198 --> 01:56:50,198
that now that we get to actually match

2836
01:56:47,560 --> 01:56:53,920
that scientific testing with what the

2837
01:56:50,198 --> 01:56:56,479
plants ultimate you know wants would

2838
01:56:53,920 --> 01:56:58,399
want to be and in in growing out and

2839
01:56:56,479 --> 01:57:00,759
also speeding and onto the next

2840
01:56:58,399 --> 01:57:02,839
varietals and onto the next

2841
01:57:00,760 --> 01:57:06,280
Generations it's really going to be

2842
01:57:02,840 --> 01:57:09,560
amazing to match that science with what

2843
01:57:06,279 --> 01:57:11,238
we perceive a plant and what we perceive

2844
01:57:09,560 --> 01:57:13,599
that she would really like to be

2845
01:57:11,238 --> 01:57:16,598
involved in and even to see that Dynamic

2846
01:57:13,599 --> 01:57:18,679
happen indoors as well yes yeah that's

2847
01:57:16,599 --> 01:57:20,119
that's the trick well that's that's the

2848
01:57:18,679 --> 01:57:22,279
trick that's everything and that's what

2849
01:57:20,118 --> 01:57:24,559
you were speaking to Jeffrey is or

2850
01:57:22,279 --> 01:57:27,599
Jeremy is is how do we how do we

2851
01:57:24,560 --> 01:57:29,039
assimilate the two so many of the top

2852
01:57:27,599 --> 01:57:31,159
producers that I've been talking to

2853
01:57:29,039 --> 01:57:35,078
lately that are that are producing

2854
01:57:31,158 --> 01:57:37,638
cannabis in volume uh indoor you know

2855
01:57:35,078 --> 01:57:39,799
there's this huge separation between how

2856
01:57:37,639 --> 01:57:41,920
can we Implement Organics how can we

2857
01:57:39,800 --> 01:57:44,880
Implement a biologically active system

2858
01:57:41,920 --> 01:57:47,199
in a sterile environment right so

2859
01:57:44,880 --> 01:57:49,239
there's a whole business Dynamic around

2860
01:57:47,198 --> 01:57:51,719
this which is listen my investors don't

2861
01:57:49,238 --> 01:57:54,118
give a [ __ ] uh what the quality is right

2862
01:57:51,719 --> 01:57:57,118
now we're being purchased on output and

2863
01:57:54,118 --> 01:57:59,839
so dude if I if I bring some Organics in

2864
01:57:57,118 --> 01:58:02,559
here I'm going to [ __ ] up my whole grow

2865
01:57:59,840 --> 01:58:05,719
and I can't use it my my investors will

2866
01:58:02,560 --> 01:58:07,679
cut my cut my funding off and Joe's

2867
01:58:05,719 --> 01:58:09,520
saying yes on this so you know exactly

2868
01:58:07,679 --> 01:58:11,279
what I'm what I'm talking about so most

2869
01:58:09,520 --> 01:58:13,040
of my most of my Growers most of my

2870
01:58:11,279 --> 01:58:15,559
customers you know that are that are

2871
01:58:13,039 --> 01:58:17,479
cultivating conventionally um this is

2872
01:58:15,560 --> 01:58:20,599
the biggest this is the biggest

2873
01:58:17,479 --> 01:58:22,638
separation of state right now between

2874
01:58:20,599 --> 01:58:26,360
the two between

2875
01:58:22,639 --> 01:58:28,679
between redefining quality and and and

2876
01:58:26,359 --> 01:58:33,000
and and and and being able to actually

2877
01:58:28,679 --> 01:58:34,319
do that in a practical way yeah so

2878
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:36,920
that's one of the things that we've done

2879
01:58:34,319 --> 01:58:39,559
with soil balance is we're trying to

2880
01:58:36,920 --> 01:58:43,359
work with with salt-based conventional

2881
01:58:39,560 --> 01:58:45,199
Growers primarily by incorporating Riso

2882
01:58:43,359 --> 01:58:46,639
bacteria that actually have a certain

2883
01:58:45,198 --> 01:58:48,078
mode of action and I want to tell you

2884
01:58:46,639 --> 01:58:51,560
guys this mode of action because it's

2885
01:58:48,078 --> 01:58:54,000
far out it's super interesting um and it

2886
01:58:51,560 --> 01:58:56,039
helps you just kind of see the

2887
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:58,439
relationship that we're all talking

2888
01:58:56,039 --> 01:59:01,399
about here so eloquently um and I'll

2889
01:58:58,439 --> 01:59:03,839
keep it very simple so go just

2890
01:59:01,399 --> 01:59:06,679
digressing back to you know going back

2891
01:59:03,840 --> 01:59:09,480
into the soil and and feeling into you

2892
01:59:06,679 --> 01:59:11,319
know what's happening in there these

2893
01:59:09,479 --> 01:59:13,559
sapres so just think of them as these

2894
01:59:11,319 --> 01:59:15,279
tiny little microscopic you know

2895
01:59:13,560 --> 01:59:16,679
organisms right and they're growing and

2896
01:59:15,279 --> 01:59:20,639
they're living and they're feeding on

2897
01:59:16,679 --> 01:59:22,440
these roots now these sapres can be in

2898
01:59:20,639 --> 01:59:24,560
conventional operations they be in

2899
01:59:22,439 --> 01:59:27,078
Hydroponics they can be in soilless

2900
01:59:24,560 --> 01:59:30,119
mediums because they only like to live

2901
01:59:27,078 --> 01:59:32,599
on the on the roots of plants um compost

2902
01:59:30,118 --> 01:59:34,679
te is not going to necessarily do this

2903
01:59:32,599 --> 01:59:36,960
these these are not the type of Riso

2904
01:59:34,679 --> 01:59:38,960
bacteria there are going to be some in

2905
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:41,560
there but a lot of the compost tees that

2906
01:59:38,960 --> 01:59:43,399
you'll find will have microbes from uh

2907
01:59:41,560 --> 01:59:45,239
you know crop residue or animal

2908
01:59:43,399 --> 01:59:47,118
intestines not necessarily the types of

2909
01:59:45,238 --> 01:59:50,078
strains that are going to grow on the

2910
01:59:47,118 --> 01:59:52,319
root comprehensively and proliferate

2911
01:59:50,078 --> 01:59:54,759
like crazy and that's what we need in

2912
01:59:52,319 --> 01:59:56,920
these sterile environments because what

2913
01:59:54,760 --> 01:59:59,159
what happens in the sterile en sterile

2914
01:59:56,920 --> 02:00:01,319
environments is people kill the kill the

2915
01:59:59,158 --> 02:00:02,920
microbes then they reinoculate them they

2916
02:00:01,319 --> 02:00:04,479
kill them they reinoculate them they

2917
02:00:02,920 --> 02:00:08,078
kill them they reinoculate all in the

2918
02:00:04,479 --> 02:00:11,118
Quest for higher tpine levels so just to

2919
02:00:08,078 --> 02:00:15,039
kind of break down how this works um

2920
02:00:11,118 --> 02:00:18,000
it's very simple so as these Riso

2921
02:00:15,039 --> 02:00:20,279
bacteria are living on the root in a

2922
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:23,198
hydroponic setting right what they're

2923
02:00:20,279 --> 02:00:25,439
doing is they're eating the sugars and

2924
02:00:23,198 --> 02:00:28,678
carbohydrates that come out of the root

2925
02:00:25,439 --> 02:00:30,000
all plants create it as they eat these

2926
02:00:28,679 --> 02:00:33,078
sugars and

2927
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:35,000
carbohydrates they they have to go to

2928
02:00:33,078 --> 02:00:38,599
the bathroom so they have to create a

2929
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:40,399
waste product right scientifically a

2930
02:00:38,599 --> 02:00:44,078
microb waste

2931
02:00:40,399 --> 02:00:45,519
product is called a secondary metabolite

2932
02:00:44,078 --> 02:00:47,799
so this is the way that microbes

2933
02:00:45,520 --> 02:00:50,360
communicate just like how tpin or how

2934
02:00:47,800 --> 02:00:53,000
plants communicate um microbes

2935
02:00:50,359 --> 02:00:55,359
communicate by creating secondary

2936
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:57,560
metabolites now a secondary metabolite

2937
02:00:55,359 --> 02:00:59,719
can be all kinds of things it could be a

2938
02:00:57,560 --> 02:01:02,639
chemical it could be an acid it could be

2939
02:00:59,719 --> 02:01:05,000
a you know a hormone an enzyme it could

2940
02:01:02,639 --> 02:01:07,279
be the saliva in your mouth it could be

2941
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:10,078
the the liquid in your eyes those are

2942
02:01:07,279 --> 02:01:13,880
all secondary metabolites

2943
02:01:10,078 --> 02:01:15,880
so in in The Roots what we want is a is

2944
02:01:13,880 --> 02:01:17,880
a secondary metabolite that can be in an

2945
02:01:15,880 --> 02:01:19,920
acid base because what that's going to

2946
02:01:17,880 --> 02:01:23,000
do is it's going to micronize and

2947
02:01:19,920 --> 02:01:24,760
pulverize your salt-based nutrients so

2948
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:27,760
as you're cultivating if you're actually

2949
02:01:24,760 --> 02:01:29,719
able to implement you know these

2950
02:01:27,760 --> 02:01:32,480
microorganisms they're going to break

2951
02:01:29,719 --> 02:01:34,118
down your calcium particle into a size

2952
02:01:32,479 --> 02:01:37,158
that the that the plant can actually

2953
02:01:34,118 --> 02:01:40,399
absorb and like I said if you can absorb

2954
02:01:37,158 --> 02:01:42,198
iron and copper and zinc those are the

2955
02:01:40,399 --> 02:01:46,078
the physics the building blocks that are

2956
02:01:42,198 --> 02:01:50,238
actually going to uh go into the turpine

2957
02:01:46,078 --> 02:01:53,559
production to create this very highlevel

2958
02:01:50,238 --> 02:01:55,238
um you know connoisseur s smell and and

2959
02:01:53,560 --> 02:01:57,360
variance where you've got all these

2960
02:01:55,238 --> 02:01:59,158
different notes and it seems like that's

2961
02:01:57,359 --> 02:02:01,719
where the industry is trending right

2962
02:01:59,158 --> 02:02:05,198
it's going not so much for the for the

2963
02:02:01,719 --> 02:02:08,520
THC but it's going towards the the the

2964
02:02:05,198 --> 02:02:10,879
the craft cultivators like a good IPA

2965
02:02:08,520 --> 02:02:13,280
and supporting that in our expansion

2966
02:02:10,880 --> 02:02:13,279
into the

2967
02:02:14,319 --> 02:02:21,000
future for sure and um I'd like to just

2968
02:02:18,078 --> 02:02:22,880
add that you know when we look at all

2969
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:25,399
the different growing

2970
02:02:22,880 --> 02:02:28,000
techniques um because we have

2971
02:02:25,399 --> 02:02:29,960
Hydroponics indoors LEDs all that stuff

2972
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:31,880
and it's like you know growing on a

2973
02:02:29,960 --> 02:02:35,639
spaceship it's cool that we can do that

2974
02:02:31,880 --> 02:02:37,480
right but like Kelly said the plants

2975
02:02:35,639 --> 02:02:40,239
perform by far the best when they're

2976
02:02:37,479 --> 02:02:44,319
actually in the soil that is connected

2977
02:02:40,238 --> 02:02:47,158
to the Earth not in a pot um and Under

2978
02:02:44,319 --> 02:02:50,039
the Sun and they actually perform better

2979
02:02:47,158 --> 02:02:52,118
Outdoors than in Greenhouse typically if

2980
02:02:50,039 --> 02:02:53,639
you could keep out the Environmental

2981
02:02:52,118 --> 02:02:56,039
other environmental factors like if you

2982
02:02:53,639 --> 02:02:58,800
could just remove the plastic and or or

2983
02:02:56,039 --> 02:03:03,198
poly and and have the the plant in the

2984
02:02:58,800 --> 02:03:05,320
sun in the soil getting the air from

2985
02:03:03,198 --> 02:03:07,479
Earth it's great it's true but for the

2986
02:03:05,319 --> 02:03:09,559
market in California that's not the case

2987
02:03:07,479 --> 02:03:11,879
the indoor is way better and it's way

2988
02:03:09,560 --> 02:03:14,880
tighter the buds are tighter um there

2989
02:03:11,880 --> 02:03:18,319
you know I I'm based I'm I'm sorry I'm

2990
02:03:14,880 --> 02:03:20,279
based in California and I would have to

2991
02:03:18,319 --> 02:03:22,399
humbly disagree now if you're talking

2992
02:03:20,279 --> 02:03:24,519
about I would Su at you Dr I'm in

2993
02:03:22,399 --> 02:03:26,238
California and that's not my experience

2994
02:03:24,520 --> 02:03:28,560
either here's the thing there's a big

2995
02:03:26,238 --> 02:03:29,959
difference I think so there's indoor and

2996
02:03:28,560 --> 02:03:32,039
outdoor right and everybody who's a

2997
02:03:29,960 --> 02:03:34,760
cultivator understands this and you

2998
02:03:32,039 --> 02:03:37,279
can't distinguish outdoor from indoor me

2999
02:03:34,760 --> 02:03:39,560
personally an outdoor flower grown in

3000
02:03:37,279 --> 02:03:41,800
soil with a tap rot you know I mean the

3001
02:03:39,560 --> 02:03:43,880
tap rot is everything and and and

3002
02:03:41,800 --> 02:03:46,279
growing with the son and growing with

3003
02:03:43,880 --> 02:03:48,559
with the with our mother yeah of course

3004
02:03:46,279 --> 02:03:50,960
like that's the way it should be grown

3005
02:03:48,559 --> 02:03:53,000
um 100% so I agree with you I'm I'm an

3006
02:03:50,960 --> 02:03:54,719
organic Regin ative agriculture

3007
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:58,840
consultant I've been doing that for 20

3008
02:03:54,719 --> 02:04:00,840
years so I'm a soil dirt farmer um not

3009
02:03:58,840 --> 02:04:03,078
an not an indoor grower at all I don't

3010
02:04:00,840 --> 02:04:04,880
really know much about indoor grower

3011
02:04:03,078 --> 02:04:07,198
growing what I do know is what my

3012
02:04:04,880 --> 02:04:09,880
customers tell me um and what what

3013
02:04:07,198 --> 02:04:13,439
they're doing and to be able to you know

3014
02:04:09,880 --> 02:04:16,239
try and bring in the organic experience

3015
02:04:13,439 --> 02:04:18,558
that I have for 20 years into that type

3016
02:04:16,238 --> 02:04:22,479
of cultivation is something that's going

3017
02:04:18,559 --> 02:04:25,880
to hopefully change the the quality uh

3018
02:04:22,479 --> 02:04:28,078
of of the uh of the commodity so you you

3019
02:04:25,880 --> 02:04:32,078
know you mentioned your work with daddy

3020
02:04:28,078 --> 02:04:34,439
Milo I work with um Dr Jim Simon out of

3021
02:04:32,078 --> 02:04:36,679
ruter and helped them breed a Downey

3022
02:04:34,439 --> 02:04:39,519
mildew resistant basil because in the

3023
02:04:36,679 --> 02:04:41,480
early 2000s Downey Milo practically

3024
02:04:39,520 --> 02:04:42,760
wiped out the basil industry in South

3025
02:04:41,479 --> 02:04:45,678
America and North

3026
02:04:42,760 --> 02:04:52,440
America and one of the things that we

3027
02:04:45,679 --> 02:04:55,800
learn there is that outdoor plants grown

3028
02:04:52,439 --> 02:04:58,158
have um stronger cuticles taste more

3029
02:04:55,800 --> 02:05:00,119
like leafy green but if you grow them in

3030
02:04:58,158 --> 02:05:03,238
the greenhouse they're softer they're

3031
02:05:00,118 --> 02:05:05,920
more like uh more edible in general more

3032
02:05:03,238 --> 02:05:08,198
palatable um and what I was trying to

3033
02:05:05,920 --> 02:05:10,760
say about cannabis I didn't say if it

3034
02:05:08,198 --> 02:05:13,198
were outdoor I said if were if you could

3035
02:05:10,760 --> 02:05:15,440
remove the plastic off of a greenhouse

3036
02:05:13,198 --> 02:05:18,759
and remove all of the environmental

3037
02:05:15,439 --> 02:05:23,319
inputs like the wind the dust the

3038
02:05:18,760 --> 02:05:27,400
rain that product is far far better than

3039
02:05:23,319 --> 02:05:30,679
a product grown under lights it is

3040
02:05:27,399 --> 02:05:32,960
100% not comp correct and it's IND

3041
02:05:30,679 --> 02:05:34,599
distinguish I mean I'm GNA tell you

3042
02:05:32,960 --> 02:05:37,840
right now I know Growers that have been

3043
02:05:34,599 --> 02:05:40,960
growing in green houses for you know

3044
02:05:37,840 --> 02:05:43,800
decades and their products were always

3045
02:05:40,960 --> 02:05:47,480
indistinguishable from

3046
02:05:43,800 --> 02:05:49,760
indoors and they got sold as indoors so

3047
02:05:47,479 --> 02:05:51,638
when you look at quality it's about the

3048
02:05:49,760 --> 02:05:52,639
chemistry and the bag appeal it doesn't

3049
02:05:51,639 --> 02:05:55,279
doesn't really matter where it's

3050
02:05:52,639 --> 02:05:59,359
cultivated but if you want the best best

3051
02:05:55,279 --> 02:06:03,960
best product it's it's soil Sun hands

3052
02:05:59,359 --> 02:06:06,000
down from seed period cure exactly I I I

3053
02:06:03,960 --> 02:06:07,920
couldn't agree more Joe Joe really

3054
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:09,840
wanted yeah I wanted to jump in yeah

3055
02:06:07,920 --> 02:06:11,078
because I I obviously there you're not

3056
02:06:09,840 --> 02:06:13,480
going to get a better expression of the

3057
02:06:11,078 --> 02:06:15,439
plant than full seed full sun in the

3058
02:06:13,479 --> 02:06:16,839
soil I think what Peter what you were

3059
02:06:15,439 --> 02:06:20,279
talking about is more like what's

3060
02:06:16,840 --> 02:06:21,800
commercially viable in our right and

3061
02:06:20,279 --> 02:06:24,319
that's just the case like I have right

3062
02:06:21,800 --> 02:06:26,239
now I have 266 cultivars right sitting

3063
02:06:24,319 --> 02:06:28,759
right next to me right here uh there's

3064
02:06:26,238 --> 02:06:31,000
personal use entry mix light entry full

3065
02:06:28,760 --> 02:06:33,119
sun grun full sungrown entry and there's

3066
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:35,039
indoor uh these are from some of the

3067
02:06:33,118 --> 02:06:38,719
best growers in the whole world in the

3068
02:06:35,039 --> 02:06:40,399
Triangle uh the outdoor is far by far

3069
02:06:38,719 --> 02:06:42,599
distinguishable from the indoor you can

3070
02:06:40,399 --> 02:06:45,598
tell tell it apart anyone who looks as

3071
02:06:42,599 --> 02:06:47,119
many colds of bars um as we do Can it

3072
02:06:45,599 --> 02:06:49,440
can easily distinguish what's from

3073
02:06:47,118 --> 02:06:50,960
outdoor and indoor um it's really just

3074
02:06:49,439 --> 02:06:54,000
about what you're getting from the full

3075
02:06:50,960 --> 02:06:56,399
canono uh Spectrum from that full sun

3076
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:57,840
and for us obviously you know looking at

3077
02:06:56,399 --> 02:06:59,638
all these entries they're going to have

3078
02:06:57,840 --> 02:07:01,960
a Best in Show from what goes up it's

3079
02:06:59,639 --> 02:07:04,599
going to be a sungrown plant that wins

3080
02:07:01,960 --> 02:07:07,920
um it's not always about the high THC

3081
02:07:04,599 --> 02:07:09,480
but with um you know craft cannabis by

3082
02:07:07,920 --> 02:07:13,078
definition not really being able to

3083
02:07:09,479 --> 02:07:15,638
scale with the cost of uh what it cost

3084
02:07:13,078 --> 02:07:18,359
to produce a plant and to have the um

3085
02:07:15,639 --> 02:07:20,639
batch sizes uh makes sense for the for

3086
02:07:18,359 --> 02:07:23,679
the farmers to to have some of these

3087
02:07:20,639 --> 02:07:26,118
higher-end um um strains you know they

3088
02:07:23,679 --> 02:07:28,599
they need um they need to have they need

3089
02:07:26,118 --> 02:07:30,039
to have a large bulk flower gr so you

3090
02:07:28,599 --> 02:07:31,800
lose a lot of that craft scale the

3091
02:07:30,039 --> 02:07:34,359
farmers that I work with who are working

3092
02:07:31,800 --> 02:07:35,920
more mixed light um they have the light

3093
02:07:34,359 --> 02:07:37,719
deps or they have some of the smaller

3094
02:07:35,920 --> 02:07:38,880
outdoor Farms they're getting much

3095
02:07:37,719 --> 02:07:40,920
better they just have more attention to

3096
02:07:38,880 --> 02:07:42,279
the plant the the harvesting they

3097
02:07:40,920 --> 02:07:44,880
actually take the time to harvest

3098
02:07:42,279 --> 02:07:47,840
they're not rushing to get to Market

3099
02:07:44,880 --> 02:07:49,599
because they have um you know investors

3100
02:07:47,840 --> 02:07:51,039
they have to get payb or they're not

3101
02:07:49,599 --> 02:07:52,880
having a distributor that's um

3102
02:07:51,039 --> 02:07:54,479
controlling it um and they maybe not

3103
02:07:52,880 --> 02:07:56,319
know how to house it and that kind of

3104
02:07:54,479 --> 02:07:58,439
ruins the flower so there's a lot

3105
02:07:56,319 --> 02:08:00,679
involved um with it what actually comes

3106
02:07:58,439 --> 02:08:02,479
to Market I think just the indoor with

3107
02:08:00,679 --> 02:08:03,559
the faster turnaround time what's how

3108
02:08:02,479 --> 02:08:05,759
it's marketed and what's more

3109
02:08:03,559 --> 02:08:08,119
commercially viable it sends those mixed

3110
02:08:05,760 --> 02:08:10,079
messages so uh you know I'm battling it

3111
02:08:08,118 --> 02:08:12,039
all the time and for the other people

3112
02:08:10,078 --> 02:08:14,719
that might be in the the the retailer

3113
02:08:12,039 --> 02:08:17,158
space it's either highend or lowend

3114
02:08:14,719 --> 02:08:18,960
there there's no middle anymore um you

3115
02:08:17,158 --> 02:08:20,598
know and most people don't understand

3116
02:08:18,960 --> 02:08:22,840
that some of the stuff that's on my

3117
02:08:20,599 --> 02:08:24,639
shelf that might be priced you know at

3118
02:08:22,840 --> 02:08:26,599
at a lower price brings just as much

3119
02:08:24,639 --> 02:08:28,400
medicinal value or better value than

3120
02:08:26,599 --> 02:08:30,400
some of those higher and indoor Str the

3121
02:08:28,399 --> 02:08:32,039
Cults of our so I think there's a lot

3122
02:08:30,399 --> 02:08:34,479
more involved with it than just you know

3123
02:08:32,039 --> 02:08:36,920
how it's grown yeah totally and and

3124
02:08:34,479 --> 02:08:41,078
getting back to you know getting back to

3125
02:08:36,920 --> 02:08:43,399
the essence um you know it all comes

3126
02:08:41,078 --> 02:08:45,238
down to costs really and affordability

3127
02:08:43,399 --> 02:08:47,319
and and the protection right the

3128
02:08:45,238 --> 02:08:49,000
integrated Pest Management so that's one

3129
02:08:47,319 --> 02:08:51,519
of the biggest things that I that I

3130
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:54,439
think is important to recognize is that

3131
02:08:51,520 --> 02:08:56,280
um if we can really take our our time

3132
02:08:54,439 --> 02:08:58,039
and do and follow some of the things

3133
02:08:56,279 --> 02:09:00,238
that like dragonfly Earth medicine is

3134
02:08:58,039 --> 02:09:03,760
doing and really Implement try and

3135
02:09:00,238 --> 02:09:05,799
Implement a lot of those practices um

3136
02:09:03,760 --> 02:09:09,440
especially the the higher amounts of

3137
02:09:05,800 --> 02:09:13,679
biology in into any operation um whether

3138
02:09:09,439 --> 02:09:16,839
it be a you know your closet or a large

3139
02:09:13,679 --> 02:09:19,800
scale operation um really working to to

3140
02:09:16,840 --> 02:09:21,880
to find the right microorganisms and in

3141
02:09:19,800 --> 02:09:24,960
my opinion what are called saprof

3142
02:09:21,880 --> 02:09:28,719
is really the beginning um aspect of

3143
02:09:24,960 --> 02:09:31,800
just improving any environment because

3144
02:09:28,719 --> 02:09:34,719
um because they're the composters so so

3145
02:09:31,800 --> 02:09:37,440
we have to get the soil filled with the

3146
02:09:34,719 --> 02:09:39,599
right U layers of humus which is what

3147
02:09:37,439 --> 02:09:41,678
sapry create then you're going to have

3148
02:09:39,599 --> 02:09:43,159
bioavailable nutrients so the

3149
02:09:41,679 --> 02:09:45,279
conversation keeps coming back to

3150
02:09:43,158 --> 02:09:47,319
Quality and tpin and quality and tpin

3151
02:09:45,279 --> 02:09:50,719
and that's the future and the only way

3152
02:09:47,319 --> 02:09:53,399
to get quality inpin is is if you have

3153
02:09:50,719 --> 02:09:55,880
bio a ailable nutrients in a particle

3154
02:09:53,399 --> 02:09:58,439
size that the plant can absorb your

3155
02:09:55,880 --> 02:10:00,960
Trace nutrients that that's everything

3156
02:09:58,439 --> 02:10:03,799
for for triome density for triome

3157
02:10:00,960 --> 02:10:06,399
strength for for

3158
02:10:03,800 --> 02:10:09,000
um you know and both of those things

3159
02:10:06,399 --> 02:10:11,399
triome density and strength are

3160
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:13,639
indicative of your biology they really

3161
02:10:11,399 --> 02:10:17,399
are you can see a much tighter like if

3162
02:10:13,639 --> 02:10:20,679
you measure a square centimeter of plant

3163
02:10:17,399 --> 02:10:23,399
tissue biologically grown and

3164
02:10:20,679 --> 02:10:26,199
conventionally grown in low biologically

3165
02:10:23,399 --> 02:10:30,039
active we have Quantified that you will

3166
02:10:26,198 --> 02:10:33,519
have three to 10 times in that square

3167
02:10:30,039 --> 02:10:35,198
centimeter of of of triome heads than

3168
02:10:33,520 --> 02:10:37,880
the

3169
02:10:35,198 --> 02:10:41,198
non-treated total oil production total

3170
02:10:37,880 --> 02:10:45,840
CBD and THC synthes enzyme production

3171
02:10:41,198 --> 02:10:48,078
has been um um bio enzymatically

3172
02:10:45,840 --> 02:10:51,360
stimulated so the plant's biosynthetic

3173
02:10:48,078 --> 02:10:52,599
Pathways have actually been stimulated

3174
02:10:51,359 --> 02:10:55,639
by these

3175
02:10:52,599 --> 02:10:58,679
microorganisms to to create more oil and

3176
02:10:55,639 --> 02:11:02,000
a more diverse uh flavor compounds

3177
02:10:58,679 --> 02:11:04,199
within that oil yeah isn't fundamentally

3178
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:06,238
one of their one of their main roles is

3179
02:11:04,198 --> 02:11:08,839
is to fix nitrogen because the plant

3180
02:11:06,238 --> 02:11:10,759
doesn't fix nitrogen itself and these

3181
02:11:08,840 --> 02:11:14,440
things are the things that make soluble

3182
02:11:10,760 --> 02:11:16,840
nitrogen so the plant can make proteins

3183
02:11:14,439 --> 02:11:19,158
and peptides which all need to be made

3184
02:11:16,840 --> 02:11:21,840
those that's the Machinery that makes

3185
02:11:19,158 --> 02:11:24,158
the right here's a really crazy thing

3186
02:11:21,840 --> 02:11:26,319
about the industry Mark is that right

3187
02:11:24,158 --> 02:11:28,679
now what most microbial companies are

3188
02:11:26,319 --> 02:11:30,880
doing is they're focus on what a microb

3189
02:11:28,679 --> 02:11:33,559
can do on its own so they're like okay

3190
02:11:30,880 --> 02:11:35,559
this microbe solubilizes phosphorus or

3191
02:11:33,559 --> 02:11:38,880
this this makes nitrogen available or

3192
02:11:35,559 --> 02:11:41,039
this this does this right but what's

3193
02:11:38,880 --> 02:11:43,679
really important just like in strains

3194
02:11:41,039 --> 02:11:46,279
and cannabis and just like human beings

3195
02:11:43,679 --> 02:11:48,520
it's not necessarily what one microb

3196
02:11:46,279 --> 02:11:50,719
does but what they produce in

3197
02:11:48,520 --> 02:11:51,840
combination that make them truly

3198
02:11:50,719 --> 02:11:54,000
effective

3199
02:11:51,840 --> 02:11:56,119
so what we've been doing is studying

3200
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:58,118
microbial combinations and the different

3201
02:11:56,118 --> 02:12:01,118
secondary metabolites they they produce

3202
02:11:58,118 --> 02:12:04,920
in in combination for 20 years and so

3203
02:12:01,118 --> 02:12:06,439
when you have a a a bunch of givers is

3204
02:12:04,920 --> 02:12:08,639
what I like to call them because there's

3205
02:12:06,439 --> 02:12:10,839
like these different kinds of organisms

3206
02:12:08,639 --> 02:12:13,159
in the soil there's there's the

3207
02:12:10,840 --> 02:12:15,360
microorganisms that live on the root

3208
02:12:13,158 --> 02:12:17,439
that they just give like a lot of

3209
02:12:15,359 --> 02:12:19,759
cannabis providers and Growers just like

3210
02:12:17,439 --> 02:12:21,479
us right these types of microbes are

3211
02:12:19,760 --> 02:12:23,960
going to give give give give give to the

3212
02:12:21,479 --> 02:12:27,519
plant to keep it alive because they

3213
02:12:23,960 --> 02:12:30,000
innately understand that their survival

3214
02:12:27,520 --> 02:12:32,440
and the survival of future Generations

3215
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:34,719
their children is based on how much they

3216
02:12:32,439 --> 02:12:36,960
can give to the plant so it's almost

3217
02:12:34,719 --> 02:12:39,960
like they create this protective biome

3218
02:12:36,960 --> 02:12:42,279
around the plant to to care for their

3219
02:12:39,960 --> 02:12:45,639
children and to care for their planet to

3220
02:12:42,279 --> 02:12:47,118
care for future Generations right so now

3221
02:12:45,639 --> 02:12:48,960
there's the other types of

3222
02:12:47,118 --> 02:12:50,598
microorganisms and they're not bad

3223
02:12:48,960 --> 02:12:54,319
they're just a part of the natural

3224
02:12:50,599 --> 02:12:56,239
system and what they believe innately is

3225
02:12:54,319 --> 02:12:58,519
that if they don't eat they're going to

3226
02:12:56,238 --> 02:13:00,399
die so they will go and they will eat

3227
02:12:58,520 --> 02:13:02,639
your [ __ ] plant that you're trying to

3228
02:13:00,399 --> 02:13:04,279
grow that you're trying to take care of

3229
02:13:02,639 --> 02:13:06,279
so there's there's this there's this

3230
02:13:04,279 --> 02:13:09,118
system and what I'm talking about is if

3231
02:13:06,279 --> 02:13:10,679
you can get the good guys the guys that

3232
02:13:09,118 --> 02:13:12,479
are giving to your plant that are that

3233
02:13:10,679 --> 02:13:14,800
are breaking down nutrients that are

3234
02:13:12,479 --> 02:13:18,198
giving it all of this love and energy

3235
02:13:14,800 --> 02:13:20,920
and light and utilizing you know

3236
02:13:18,198 --> 02:13:22,879
that then when the bad guys come to the

3237
02:13:20,920 --> 02:13:24,639
par party and they want to smoke a bowl

3238
02:13:22,880 --> 02:13:26,400
you're like dude there's no room for you

3239
02:13:24,639 --> 02:13:28,118
guys get the [ __ ] out of here that

3240
02:13:26,399 --> 02:13:29,359
that's kind of how it is Peter you

3241
02:13:28,118 --> 02:13:33,880
mentioned

3242
02:13:29,359 --> 02:13:36,839
Rd that showed three to 10 times as much

3243
02:13:33,880 --> 02:13:40,559
uh triome heads per centimeter or

3244
02:13:36,840 --> 02:13:43,319
whatever well is that published and I

3245
02:13:40,559 --> 02:13:45,320
I'd love to post it in this room and I

3246
02:13:43,319 --> 02:13:47,118
I'd be happy to share it publicly sure

3247
02:13:45,319 --> 02:13:50,198
let me bring it up right

3248
02:13:47,118 --> 02:13:53,439
now I can facilitate uh getting it to

3249
02:13:50,198 --> 02:13:57,078
you as well from Peter Sam oh we we'd

3250
02:13:53,439 --> 02:13:59,000
all like to see it actually um because

3251
02:13:57,078 --> 02:14:01,000
we've been running studies like this

3252
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:03,439
including time course analysis on

3253
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:05,679
metabolite accumulation for well over a

3254
02:14:03,439 --> 02:14:07,879
decade in cannabis specifically and as

3255
02:14:05,679 --> 02:14:11,039
mentioned we work with basil and other

3256
02:14:07,880 --> 02:14:14,279
culinary herbs but um can't wait to see

3257
02:14:11,039 --> 02:14:19,198
that yeah there it is so if you if you

3258
02:14:14,279 --> 02:14:22,679
wanted to zoom in on it Marcus and

3259
02:14:19,198 --> 02:14:24,960
just I'll be honest I I I can't zoom in

3260
02:14:22,679 --> 02:14:26,880
on it anymore because I'm now on my

3261
02:14:24,960 --> 02:14:29,559
phone driving up to Whistler to catch

3262
02:14:26,880 --> 02:14:32,840
some powder I I couldn't give a past

3263
02:14:29,559 --> 02:14:34,760
church or powder today so uh I can't I

3264
02:14:32,840 --> 02:14:37,520
can't do that

3265
02:14:34,760 --> 02:14:40,400
man Peter I was wondering pet there's

3266
02:14:37,520 --> 02:14:45,440
been some connection oh sorry please no

3267
02:14:40,399 --> 02:14:49,558
I have a quick one which is did the THC

3268
02:14:45,439 --> 02:14:54,039
or Andor cannaboid levels of those

3269
02:14:49,559 --> 02:14:57,039
varieties increase Le three to 10 times

3270
02:14:54,039 --> 02:15:00,198
yes the the total oil production went up

3271
02:14:57,039 --> 02:15:03,279
accordingly uh to the plants uh genetic

3272
02:15:00,198 --> 02:15:07,319
predispositions so this was done on hemp

3273
02:15:03,279 --> 02:15:09,679
right yeah on 162 hemp farms and you

3274
02:15:07,319 --> 02:15:11,920
know we had University professors

3275
02:15:09,679 --> 02:15:13,639
overview it and study it and and it

3276
02:15:11,920 --> 02:15:16,000
showed the impact of what a highly

3277
02:15:13,639 --> 02:15:18,880
biologically active system can do in

3278
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:21,679
cannabis cultivation for Quality so if

3279
02:15:18,880 --> 02:15:26,480
we're talking about yields as far as the

3280
02:15:21,679 --> 02:15:29,199
organic versus the the other guys um we

3281
02:15:26,479 --> 02:15:31,000
hit 5,000 pounds per the acre the

3282
02:15:29,198 --> 02:15:33,598
conventional Fields were hitting 3,000

3283
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:35,800
pounds approximately so we had that as a

3284
02:15:33,599 --> 02:15:38,639
huge Advantage um we produced

3285
02:15:35,800 --> 02:15:42,159
approximately 30% more total oil

3286
02:15:38,639 --> 02:15:45,480
production than than the non-organic the

3287
02:15:42,158 --> 02:15:47,598
other thing is that we also Sam to

3288
02:15:45,479 --> 02:15:50,279
answer your question saw some really

3289
02:15:47,599 --> 02:15:53,159
unique things in the canono expression

3290
02:15:50,279 --> 02:15:56,279
so one of the things that we saw was

3291
02:15:53,158 --> 02:15:59,638
through the the biological mitigation of

3292
02:15:56,279 --> 02:16:04,559
stress induction on the plant in the

3293
02:15:59,639 --> 02:16:06,719
soil uh we saw um the the delta in in

3294
02:16:04,559 --> 02:16:10,400
it's interesting in the hemp plant we

3295
02:16:06,719 --> 02:16:12,118
saw Delta 9 actually levels

3296
02:16:10,399 --> 02:16:15,839
decrease

3297
02:16:12,118 --> 02:16:18,719
um and the CBD uh levels increased so

3298
02:16:15,840 --> 02:16:21,119
the cannabinoids increased the CBD but

3299
02:16:18,719 --> 02:16:23,439
then in medical marijuana we saw the

3300
02:16:21,118 --> 02:16:26,399
Delta 9 go through the roof so it was

3301
02:16:23,439 --> 02:16:28,439
just interesting how the biology just

3302
02:16:26,399 --> 02:16:30,279
give allows the plant to just achieve

3303
02:16:28,439 --> 02:16:33,558
its full genetic

3304
02:16:30,279 --> 02:16:35,519
Expressions um which was interesting so

3305
02:16:33,558 --> 02:16:38,159
the Delta 9 mitigation in hemp was

3306
02:16:35,519 --> 02:16:41,880
interesting because what

3307
02:16:38,159 --> 02:16:46,679
we concluded or hypothesized was that

3308
02:16:41,879 --> 02:16:49,279
the um the actual uh stress induced by a

3309
02:16:46,679 --> 02:16:52,040
lot of the plant parasitic nematodes or

3310
02:16:49,280 --> 02:16:55,040
the uh the health ISS ISU in the soil

3311
02:16:52,040 --> 02:16:57,200
weren't as present um so for instance in

3312
02:16:55,040 --> 02:16:58,559
heterogeneous soils especially

3313
02:16:57,200 --> 02:17:00,719
conventionally treated where they were

3314
02:16:58,558 --> 02:17:03,638
cultivating large scale cannabis they

3315
02:17:00,718 --> 02:17:06,678
ended up um you know just putting the

3316
02:17:03,638 --> 02:17:10,159
plant right into Old tobacco fields in

3317
02:17:06,679 --> 02:17:13,679
North Carolina and this particular plant

3318
02:17:10,159 --> 02:17:15,478
instead of like you know the cannabis

3319
02:17:13,679 --> 02:17:18,200
plant instead of when it got hit with

3320
02:17:15,478 --> 02:17:19,920
all these health issues this disease

3321
02:17:18,200 --> 02:17:21,399
instead of like the leaves curling up

3322
02:17:19,920 --> 02:17:24,120
and you seeing all the Sun L like you

3323
02:17:21,398 --> 02:17:25,920
would like a tomato plant um this plant

3324
02:17:24,120 --> 02:17:30,200
just said [ __ ] you I'm not going to give

3325
02:17:25,920 --> 02:17:32,679
you guys any oil so we got like 9% CBD

3326
02:17:30,200 --> 02:17:34,920
and the Delta 9 was through the roof

3327
02:17:32,679 --> 02:17:37,000
whereas once we mitigated a lot of those

3328
02:17:34,920 --> 02:17:39,079
stress inductions that were over the

3329
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:42,679
limit of what it would be to trigger a

3330
02:17:39,079 --> 02:17:47,318
turpine reaction we ended up seeing um

3331
02:17:42,679 --> 02:17:51,079
uh really high cannaboid output like 21%

3332
02:17:47,318 --> 02:17:53,239
CBD and tpes that went up as high as 3%

3333
02:17:51,079 --> 02:17:55,478
in hemp which was pretty significant

3334
02:17:53,239 --> 02:17:59,318
what was the THC level in that

3335
02:17:55,478 --> 02:18:02,039
case so they usually went hot so it was

3336
02:17:59,318 --> 02:18:07,398
based on the genetics so the THC would

3337
02:18:02,040 --> 02:18:10,200
actually go up um based on the again the

3338
02:18:07,398 --> 02:18:12,558
the plant's genetic expression so

3339
02:18:10,200 --> 02:18:15,479
usually they would be up as if the

3340
02:18:12,558 --> 02:18:17,398
cannabinoids went up the T the THC went

3341
02:18:15,478 --> 02:18:19,159
up so so you you didn't see any

3342
02:18:17,398 --> 02:18:21,638
differential change in the relative

3343
02:18:19,159 --> 02:18:23,879
amounts the only difference we saw was

3344
02:18:21,638 --> 02:18:26,759
that the Delta 9 was lower in the

3345
02:18:23,879 --> 02:18:29,079
biologically active treated but the thca

3346
02:18:26,760 --> 02:18:32,040
was the same I want to throw in a

3347
02:18:29,079 --> 02:18:33,519
thought uh to kind of revisit what Kelly

3348
02:18:32,040 --> 02:18:35,599
was talking about earlier around the

3349
02:18:33,519 --> 02:18:37,639
needs of the plant one of the things

3350
02:18:35,599 --> 02:18:39,920
I've come to realize and believe is that

3351
02:18:37,638 --> 02:18:42,638
the genetics of the plant suggest what

3352
02:18:39,920 --> 02:18:44,760
it's going to produce but the

3353
02:18:42,638 --> 02:18:47,199
epigenetics the environment it's in and

3354
02:18:44,760 --> 02:18:49,280
how it's treated and how it grows is

3355
02:18:47,200 --> 02:18:52,159
going to have some a lot to do with how

3356
02:18:49,280 --> 02:18:55,559
much of that potential it

3357
02:18:52,159 --> 02:19:00,159
expresses and uh what I'm realizing or

3358
02:18:55,558 --> 02:19:04,000
feeling somehow is that um the the

3359
02:19:00,159 --> 02:19:07,519
cannabis plant itself because

3360
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:12,359
of is producing this chemistry for its

3361
02:19:07,519 --> 02:19:15,079
needs to address its situation its place

3362
02:19:12,359 --> 02:19:18,200
in the garden or in industrial facility

3363
02:19:15,079 --> 02:19:20,359
that's it's in or whatever but the the

3364
02:19:18,200 --> 02:19:22,960
Cannabis chemistry is at least partially

3365
02:19:20,359 --> 02:19:25,719
shaped by the needs of the plant like I

3366
02:19:22,959 --> 02:19:30,000
think certain tpes might Express where a

3367
02:19:25,718 --> 02:19:31,959
plant is being attacked by pests and I

3368
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:33,519
I'm just there's some Beautiful Minds in

3369
02:19:31,959 --> 02:19:35,879
this conversation I'd really love to

3370
02:19:33,519 --> 02:19:39,800
hear some thoughts on that point of view

3371
02:19:35,879 --> 02:19:41,638
of how does the how is that is that real

3372
02:19:39,799 --> 02:19:44,000
is it the plants needs that are actually

3373
02:19:41,638 --> 02:19:44,759
causing the expression of this chemistry

3374
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:48,040
thank

3375
02:19:44,760 --> 02:19:50,800
you well I know that in the trials that

3376
02:19:48,040 --> 02:19:53,439
we so Neo oversees a lot of different

3377
02:19:50,799 --> 02:19:57,358
cultivations right and similar to

3378
02:19:53,439 --> 02:20:00,280
Peter's study um we look at same

3379
02:19:57,359 --> 02:20:02,359
genotypes across multiple environments

3380
02:20:00,280 --> 02:20:05,120
within the same identical environment I

3381
02:20:02,359 --> 02:20:08,000
mean our data set is definitely the

3382
02:20:05,120 --> 02:20:10,760
largest in the world for replicates of a

3383
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:13,920
single genotype Andor seed hybrids over

3384
02:20:10,760 --> 02:20:16,239
the course of um the past 10 years and

3385
02:20:13,920 --> 02:20:19,840
the variations and experiments where

3386
02:20:16,239 --> 02:20:22,119
we've altered one thing at a time not

3387
02:20:19,840 --> 02:20:24,000
not like having an open field trial

3388
02:20:22,120 --> 02:20:26,760
where you have all these different

3389
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:29,520
environments micro environments micro

3390
02:20:26,760 --> 02:20:31,880
micro environments but instead if you

3391
02:20:29,520 --> 02:20:33,960
know we're using the identical soil

3392
02:20:31,879 --> 02:20:37,679
across three rooms the rooms are

3393
02:20:33,959 --> 02:20:39,239
identical height width length and in one

3394
02:20:37,680 --> 02:20:42,280
room we use

3395
02:20:39,239 --> 02:20:43,559
conventional uh salt and every all the

3396
02:20:42,280 --> 02:20:45,920
other inputs all the other Pest

3397
02:20:43,559 --> 02:20:48,398
Management everything is the same the

3398
02:20:45,920 --> 02:20:51,639
other room we use convention ass assault

3399
02:20:48,398 --> 02:20:54,239
plus a bio stimulant or you you know

3400
02:20:51,639 --> 02:20:59,119
another amendment and generally the

3401
02:20:54,239 --> 02:21:02,000
trend is when you use the salts you have

3402
02:20:59,120 --> 02:21:04,319
higher cannaboid concentrations and

3403
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:07,040
lower and less diverse turpenoid

3404
02:21:04,318 --> 02:21:11,359
concentrations and when you use more and

3405
02:21:07,040 --> 02:21:14,960
more um organic techniques you have uh

3406
02:21:11,359 --> 02:21:18,479
lower overall cannaboid production but

3407
02:21:14,959 --> 02:21:21,438
higher and more diverse more body in

3408
02:21:18,478 --> 02:21:23,119
your turpenoid production so on that

3409
02:21:21,439 --> 02:21:26,720
part we agree but the yields are

3410
02:21:23,120 --> 02:21:30,040
consistently lower uh with more and more

3411
02:21:26,719 --> 02:21:31,599
increasing organic uh contributions but

3412
02:21:30,040 --> 02:21:34,040
again you know you can only have so much

3413
02:21:31,600 --> 02:21:37,680
good and so much bad and you got to

3414
02:21:34,040 --> 02:21:41,200
weigh what you do and and like you were

3415
02:21:37,680 --> 02:21:43,120
asking about the tpes and pests you know

3416
02:21:41,200 --> 02:21:46,280
there's there's certain tpine profiles

3417
02:21:43,120 --> 02:21:48,600
that attract cannabis aphids certain

3418
02:21:46,280 --> 02:21:51,439
turpine profiles that attract the broad

3419
02:21:48,600 --> 02:21:53,920
Mite so it's it's very interesting

3420
02:21:51,439 --> 02:21:56,559
because it it's almost like those are

3421
02:21:53,920 --> 02:21:58,719
singing out to the bug saying hey come

3422
02:21:56,559 --> 02:22:01,920
on over here and they they go over there

3423
02:21:58,719 --> 02:22:04,559
and it's really really neat they're

3424
02:22:01,920 --> 02:22:07,159
attracting pollinators right I mean

3425
02:22:04,559 --> 02:22:09,279
isn't that the the reason why the the

3426
02:22:07,159 --> 02:22:12,318
tpine profiles are expressed in the plan

3427
02:22:09,280 --> 02:22:16,159
to begin with it's in in an evolutionary

3428
02:22:12,318 --> 02:22:20,600
sense is to attract pollinators and it's

3429
02:22:16,159 --> 02:22:22,879
is wind pollinated Mark well I'm sorry

3430
02:22:20,600 --> 02:22:24,800
well actually it's human pollinated and

3431
02:22:22,879 --> 02:22:27,398
it has attract the [ __ ] out of us

3432
02:22:24,799 --> 02:22:29,679
because I love the SM okay but I meant

3433
02:22:27,398 --> 02:22:32,159
before us

3434
02:22:29,680 --> 02:22:34,079
humans hey uh Mark I just wanted to

3435
02:22:32,159 --> 02:22:37,439
mention how funny that you work with Jim

3436
02:22:34,079 --> 02:22:40,120
Simon at Ruckers um I I also worked with

3437
02:22:37,439 --> 02:22:44,120
them on a completely different plant too

3438
02:22:40,120 --> 02:22:47,040
on on cat Min so oh yes yes yes the

3439
02:22:44,120 --> 02:22:49,120
tiger deterrent uh for well for the

3440
02:22:47,040 --> 02:22:51,600
insect repellent sorry but you don't

3441
02:22:49,120 --> 02:22:55,160
want it to attract the Tiger

3442
02:22:51,600 --> 02:22:57,120
as it turns out that's a um an effect

3443
02:22:55,159 --> 02:23:00,639
that's conserved throughout the feline

3444
02:22:57,120 --> 02:23:04,079
Kingdom so so yeah they they they have

3445
02:23:00,639 --> 02:23:06,840
the same I guess reaction to these

3446
02:23:04,079 --> 02:23:08,120
nepetalactone uh containing oils so and

3447
02:23:06,840 --> 02:23:09,960
you definitely don't want a mosquito

3448
02:23:08,120 --> 02:23:12,840
repellent that attracts the cat to come

3449
02:23:09,959 --> 02:23:14,759
play with you right yeah but again help

3450
02:23:12,840 --> 02:23:18,359
us postulate we've talked about this on

3451
02:23:14,760 --> 02:23:21,239
hash Church before you know why would

3452
02:23:18,359 --> 02:23:25,200
why would a plant like cat catnip is

3453
02:23:21,239 --> 02:23:27,079
just really variety that is again just

3454
02:23:25,200 --> 02:23:30,680
something that just intrigues me just in

3455
02:23:27,079 --> 02:23:34,279
terms of plant evolutionary biology is

3456
02:23:30,680 --> 02:23:37,520
it attracts cats and it actually it's

3457
02:23:34,279 --> 02:23:40,000
insect repellent but it attracts the uh

3458
02:23:37,520 --> 02:23:41,880
I I think a certain lace Wing so I think

3459
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:44,680
there's a certain insect that it

3460
02:23:41,879 --> 02:23:48,239
actually attracts but it it repels most

3461
02:23:44,680 --> 02:23:50,639
but wh why would evolutionary biology

3462
02:23:48,239 --> 02:23:52,520
end up having such peculiar properties

3463
02:23:50,639 --> 02:23:55,879
for one

3464
02:23:52,520 --> 02:23:58,880
plant well lce swing is a beneficial it

3465
02:23:55,879 --> 02:24:01,679
goes after apids and all kinds of other

3466
02:23:58,879 --> 02:24:04,278
pest right right so it attracts actually

3467
02:24:01,680 --> 02:24:06,159
a good a good insect but I don't get the

3468
02:24:04,279 --> 02:24:07,520
cat connection that's what I'm trying to

3469
02:24:06,159 --> 02:24:10,760
figure

3470
02:24:07,520 --> 02:24:12,239
out what I don't have any Notions there

3471
02:24:10,760 --> 02:24:14,359
but there's an interesting thing that

3472
02:24:12,239 --> 02:24:17,279
I've observed in canopies we've talked

3473
02:24:14,359 --> 02:24:19,960
about sort of chemistry calling in sort

3474
02:24:17,279 --> 02:24:21,600
of other allies or adversaries but I

3475
02:24:19,959 --> 02:24:23,199
think about one of the most interesting

3476
02:24:21,600 --> 02:24:26,040
things was when I started getting a lot

3477
02:24:23,200 --> 02:24:29,240
of terpinolene dominant varieties into

3478
02:24:26,040 --> 02:24:31,960
mixed cultivar rooms suddenly varieties

3479
02:24:29,239 --> 02:24:34,799
that had no terpinolene expression began

3480
02:24:31,959 --> 02:24:37,559
to have low-level terpinolene presence

3481
02:24:34,799 --> 02:24:40,840
and even uptick over time I'm fascinated

3482
02:24:37,559 --> 02:24:43,039
about VOC signaling above ground as well

3483
02:24:40,840 --> 02:24:45,040
as root exudates and the fact that you

3484
02:24:43,040 --> 02:24:47,840
can co-mingle varieties and clearly have

3485
02:24:45,040 --> 02:24:49,560
an impact I even wonder then could you

3486
02:24:47,840 --> 02:24:52,200
take and I've never done any of this

3487
02:24:49,559 --> 02:24:54,519
work but you know a certain distilled

3488
02:24:52,200 --> 02:24:56,600
turpine say lemoning and have that same

3489
02:24:54,520 --> 02:24:58,279
sort of impact without even the plant

3490
02:24:56,600 --> 02:25:00,479
present but that that conversation

3491
02:24:58,279 --> 02:25:02,359
that's happening in voc's is something

3492
02:25:00,478 --> 02:25:04,478
we're starting to measure there's these

3493
02:25:02,359 --> 02:25:06,920
high density sensor networks that are

3494
02:25:04,478 --> 02:25:10,599
these little bluetooth enabled devices

3495
02:25:06,920 --> 02:25:12,840
that pick up the VPD and CO2 and ppfd

3496
02:25:10,600 --> 02:25:15,079
but now they're adding voc's to them and

3497
02:25:12,840 --> 02:25:17,079
every three feet in the canopy at two to

3498
02:25:15,079 --> 02:25:19,398
three layers you're able to really get

3499
02:25:17,079 --> 02:25:21,478
this comprehensive view it'll be very

3500
02:25:19,398 --> 02:25:24,000
very interesting to then correlate some

3501
02:25:21,478 --> 02:25:26,000
of the aromatic expression in the choar

3502
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:27,600
or in the chemotypes within what we

3503
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:30,239
observe in the highdensity sensor

3504
02:25:27,600 --> 02:25:31,840
Network just trying to observe and

3505
02:25:30,239 --> 02:25:35,199
listen to in a way that we can

3506
02:25:31,840 --> 02:25:36,600
analytically quantify that dialogue I

3507
02:25:35,200 --> 02:25:39,159
there's another thread that I think is

3508
02:25:36,600 --> 02:25:41,279
so important that Josh asked earlier and

3509
02:25:39,159 --> 02:25:43,039
that has been kind of floating around a

3510
02:25:41,279 --> 02:25:45,479
little bit that I just think for folks

3511
02:25:43,040 --> 02:25:47,399
who might tune in and who are looking to

3512
02:25:45,478 --> 02:25:49,599
sort of some information about how do

3513
02:25:47,398 --> 02:25:52,439
you once you've harvested all of these

3514
02:25:49,600 --> 02:25:54,760
incredible aromatic compounds get that

3515
02:25:52,439 --> 02:25:57,840
to the patient to the consumer in a

3516
02:25:54,760 --> 02:26:00,159
meaningful way I what I see universally

3517
02:25:57,840 --> 02:26:02,359
in the Oregon and California market and

3518
02:26:00,159 --> 02:26:05,159
I I do mean a vast majority of all of

3519
02:26:02,359 --> 02:26:07,920
the flower that I'm seeing is what the

3520
02:26:05,159 --> 02:26:10,478
Hops Growers would call spoiled flower

3521
02:26:07,920 --> 02:26:13,200
and hops when I interact with the team

3522
02:26:10,478 --> 02:26:16,079
at yaka Chief hops a lot they they

3523
02:26:13,200 --> 02:26:19,000
Define a spoiled hops a variety as

3524
02:26:16,079 --> 02:26:22,000
something that has lost more than 50% of

3525
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:24,120
the aromatic contribution that was

3526
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:26,478
analyzed at the beginning and then they

3527
02:26:24,120 --> 02:26:28,760
have really incredible time trials where

3528
02:26:26,478 --> 02:26:31,318
they pack at zero degrees and myar with

3529
02:26:28,760 --> 02:26:33,840
noble gases and are able to extend the

3530
02:26:31,318 --> 02:26:35,879
longevity of the profile that was there

3531
02:26:33,840 --> 02:26:38,520
at the beginning it's fascinating

3532
02:26:35,879 --> 02:26:41,079
contrasting preserving the original

3533
02:26:38,520 --> 02:26:43,800
expression as opposed to the distinct

3534
02:26:41,079 --> 02:26:46,079
effects of uh curing and all of the kind

3535
02:26:43,799 --> 02:26:48,039
of Transformations that can occur I I

3536
02:26:46,079 --> 02:26:49,959
think there's a bit of a tension between

3537
02:26:48,040 --> 02:26:52,279
those two different goals but in any

3538
02:26:49,959 --> 02:26:54,599
case I think a vast majority of all of

3539
02:26:52,279 --> 02:26:56,760
the flour that is being served at retail

3540
02:26:54,600 --> 02:26:58,800
dispensaries is currently what we should

3541
02:26:56,760 --> 02:27:01,040
Define as spoiled and there are a

3542
02:26:58,799 --> 02:27:03,639
variety of practical strategies that I

3543
02:27:01,040 --> 02:27:05,760
think can be put into place to really

3544
02:27:03,639 --> 02:27:09,079
preserve freshness and that we have a

3545
02:27:05,760 --> 02:27:11,279
freshness crisis as especially scaled

3546
02:27:09,079 --> 02:27:14,398
options came and people stopped putting

3547
02:27:11,279 --> 02:27:16,760
love into that postprocess and a few of

3548
02:27:14,398 --> 02:27:19,879
the observations I've had is essentially

3549
02:27:16,760 --> 02:27:23,239
if we're packing at about 10% moisture

3550
02:27:19,879 --> 02:27:26,879
and we are able to uh alleviate that

3551
02:27:23,239 --> 02:27:29,719
8% water activity Mark pretty rapidly in

3552
02:27:26,879 --> 02:27:31,839
drawing as Dr Allison Justice actually

3553
02:27:29,719 --> 02:27:33,478
if anybody's not aware of Allison's work

3554
02:27:31,840 --> 02:27:35,279
she's one of the only people I've heard

3555
02:27:33,478 --> 02:27:37,719
of who's really done some strong

3556
02:27:35,279 --> 02:27:39,399
analytics looking at postprocess and

3557
02:27:37,719 --> 02:27:41,398
she's lecturing about this in a few

3558
02:27:39,398 --> 02:27:43,478
different podcasts she's easy to find

3559
02:27:41,398 --> 02:27:46,840
but the basic gist is that if you can

3560
02:27:43,478 --> 02:27:48,920
hit 8% water activity buritis cannot

3561
02:27:46,840 --> 02:27:51,359
form you're not going to have fungal

3562
02:27:48,920 --> 02:27:53,920
pathogens so typically she's advocating

3563
02:27:51,359 --> 02:27:56,079
more that aggressive dry for the first

3564
02:27:53,920 --> 02:27:58,239
48 hours to just simply be able to

3565
02:27:56,079 --> 02:28:01,039
attain that of course that point8

3566
02:27:58,239 --> 02:28:03,079
doesn't remain static over time it does

3567
02:28:01,040 --> 02:28:05,880
sort of obviously the exterior of the

3568
02:28:03,079 --> 02:28:07,799
flow is going to lose moisture first and

3569
02:28:05,879 --> 02:28:10,278
things will equilibrate as they're in a

3570
02:28:07,799 --> 02:28:12,000
sort of drying room together over time

3571
02:28:10,279 --> 02:28:14,200
or they're packed together so there's

3572
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:17,159
ongoing monitoring that's needed but if

3573
02:28:14,200 --> 02:28:19,760
you can hit that and then really slow

3574
02:28:17,159 --> 02:28:22,000
and low kind of carry it as as far as

3575
02:28:19,760 --> 02:28:24,478
possible without being concerned about

3576
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:26,639
the fungal issues which in Oregon I mean

3577
02:28:24,478 --> 02:28:29,079
easily the greatest loss of crop value

3578
02:28:26,639 --> 02:28:31,879
is related to Bettis and everything we

3579
02:28:29,079 --> 02:28:34,920
can do to prevent that loss is is just a

3580
02:28:31,879 --> 02:28:36,599
tremendous means of staying afloat and

3581
02:28:34,920 --> 02:28:39,040
it's very very important so I think that

3582
02:28:36,600 --> 02:28:41,559
is one of the most important pieces but

3583
02:28:39,040 --> 02:28:43,600
then in terms of packing I do think it's

3584
02:28:41,559 --> 02:28:46,079
fascinating when I was in a wholesale

3585
02:28:43,600 --> 02:28:48,239
buying trip for this company that had

3586
02:28:46,079 --> 02:28:51,318
helped uh hired me to get wholesale

3587
02:28:48,239 --> 02:28:53,318
flour for them which ESS I was able to

3588
02:28:51,318 --> 02:28:55,600
secure a lot of exclusively

3589
02:28:53,318 --> 02:28:57,639
regeneratively grown produce from people

3590
02:28:55,600 --> 02:29:00,200
like Tina moonmaid and all kinds of our

3591
02:28:57,639 --> 02:29:02,278
peers in Northern California last year

3592
02:29:00,200 --> 02:29:04,880
um what I saw almost universally was

3593
02:29:02,279 --> 02:29:06,720
that it was all packed in Turkey bags

3594
02:29:04,879 --> 02:29:09,519
and that we still are using porous

3595
02:29:06,719 --> 02:29:12,199
membranes to hold in this incredible

3596
02:29:09,520 --> 02:29:14,200
sensuous Aroma and of course are losing

3597
02:29:12,200 --> 02:29:16,560
a lot of that Aroma as a result but then

3598
02:29:14,200 --> 02:29:18,680
there's this issue with myar where now

3599
02:29:16,559 --> 02:29:20,799
do we want another massive waste stream

3600
02:29:18,680 --> 02:29:22,960
like the gram containers and the

3601
02:29:20,799 --> 02:29:24,719
pre-roll containers that literally are

3602
02:29:22,959 --> 02:29:27,318
littering the streets of Portland

3603
02:29:24,719 --> 02:29:30,119
anywhere you go it is an absolute you

3604
02:29:27,318 --> 02:29:33,039
know eyesore [ __ ] that has to get

3605
02:29:30,120 --> 02:29:35,600
solved but the so obviously glass as

3606
02:29:33,040 --> 02:29:37,359
Josh is lifting up is like the Fantastic

3607
02:29:35,600 --> 02:29:38,960
solution and I love even I don't know

3608
02:29:37,359 --> 02:29:40,840
how many people are using this sort of

3609
02:29:38,959 --> 02:29:43,719
fermentation equipment where you can

3610
02:29:40,840 --> 02:29:45,680
pump oxygen out of glass there's a lid

3611
02:29:43,719 --> 02:29:48,559
that attaches to any normal sort of

3612
02:29:45,680 --> 02:29:50,559
glass jar and then like a wine preserver

3613
02:29:48,559 --> 02:29:53,000
you sort of pump out the oxygen

3614
02:29:50,559 --> 02:29:54,840
and then with removing that oxidative

3615
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:56,959
stress and bringing that into

3616
02:29:54,840 --> 02:29:58,799
potentially a refrigerated environment

3617
02:29:56,959 --> 02:30:01,478
but being able to just extend the

3618
02:29:58,799 --> 02:30:04,438
longevity of that Aroma intensity I

3619
02:30:01,478 --> 02:30:06,920
think is one of these giant qaqc pieces

3620
02:30:04,439 --> 02:30:09,000
one more tiny riff here is that I think

3621
02:30:06,920 --> 02:30:11,159
that sensory science has been coming up

3622
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:13,279
a lot in the clubhouse conversations

3623
02:30:11,159 --> 02:30:15,879
recently and that one of the fascinating

3624
02:30:13,279 --> 02:30:18,520
things is here we may be um according to

3625
02:30:15,879 --> 02:30:20,519
the Hops people overweighting the

3626
02:30:18,520 --> 02:30:22,760
importance of the Analytics obviously

3627
02:30:20,520 --> 02:30:24,560
the analytics are unbelievably important

3628
02:30:22,760 --> 02:30:26,520
it's just that from a product quality

3629
02:30:24,559 --> 02:30:28,959
perspective and the average patient and

3630
02:30:26,520 --> 02:30:31,640
consumer perspective it's so much more

3631
02:30:28,959 --> 02:30:34,039
about sort of the experience of of that

3632
02:30:31,639 --> 02:30:36,318
product and the fact is there's really

3633
02:30:34,040 --> 02:30:39,040
amazing technical ways to do

3634
02:30:36,318 --> 02:30:41,199
sophisticated sensory evaluation that I

3635
02:30:39,040 --> 02:30:43,760
do not see generally happening in our

3636
02:30:41,200 --> 02:30:46,439
space I see individuals practicing that

3637
02:30:43,760 --> 02:30:48,680
but there's a woman named Lauren salzar

3638
02:30:46,439 --> 02:30:51,720
who's at new Belgian Brewery for 10

3639
02:30:48,680 --> 02:30:53,559
years who built this really robust

3640
02:30:51,719 --> 02:30:55,519
sensory science program that now has

3641
02:30:53,559 --> 02:30:57,119
gone out to all kinds of other breweries

3642
02:30:55,520 --> 02:30:58,920
she's just recently started working in

3643
02:30:57,120 --> 02:31:01,600
cannabis and she has some fantastic

3644
02:30:58,920 --> 02:31:04,520
podcasts this notion of in order to move

3645
02:31:01,600 --> 02:31:07,840
from more subjective perception of

3646
02:31:04,520 --> 02:31:10,520
effects into a more objective evaluation

3647
02:31:07,840 --> 02:31:12,318
of sensory using the human old factory

3648
02:31:10,520 --> 02:31:15,120
which I mean we could say that we could

3649
02:31:12,318 --> 02:31:16,519
detect up to a trillion potential Aromas

3650
02:31:15,120 --> 02:31:18,479
but really let's just go into the

3651
02:31:16,520 --> 02:31:20,600
infinite with numbers we can't quantify

3652
02:31:18,478 --> 02:31:22,519
or characterize it's and that we don't

3653
02:31:20,600 --> 02:31:25,120
even have language or will ever have

3654
02:31:22,520 --> 02:31:27,760
language to describe the Nuance of that

3655
02:31:25,120 --> 02:31:29,920
kind of vastness but we can take panels

3656
02:31:27,760 --> 02:31:32,920
of people who are highly trained to

3657
02:31:29,920 --> 02:31:35,960
identify their own anosmia which are the

3658
02:31:32,920 --> 02:31:37,840
things we can't smell well or at all and

3659
02:31:35,959 --> 02:31:40,478
essentially through a diverse group over

3660
02:31:37,840 --> 02:31:42,639
time get pretty consistent results and

3661
02:31:40,478 --> 02:31:43,879
talk about that in a lot of ways I feel

3662
02:31:42,639 --> 02:31:46,119
like this is one of the things that

3663
02:31:43,879 --> 02:31:49,119
challenges the hegemony of purchasing

3664
02:31:46,120 --> 02:31:52,359
high THC product to open the door to all

3665
02:31:49,120 --> 02:31:54,240
of the modern potency poetic incredible

3666
02:31:52,359 --> 02:31:56,239
expressions of the plant that I think

3667
02:31:54,239 --> 02:31:58,398
she genuinely wants to be in the world

3668
02:31:56,239 --> 02:32:02,199
because I keep finding some of the most

3669
02:31:58,398 --> 02:32:04,159
Aroma intense profiles beneath 20% THC

3670
02:32:02,200 --> 02:32:05,600
and that ultimately is like just a

3671
02:32:04,159 --> 02:32:07,559
really valuable experience to be

3672
02:32:05,600 --> 02:32:09,720
cherished but literally can't exist in

3673
02:32:07,559 --> 02:32:11,600
the wholesale Market I can't sell that

3674
02:32:09,719 --> 02:32:13,278
product I can't grow that product I will

3675
02:32:11,600 --> 02:32:15,359
lose every dime that I put into that

3676
02:32:13,279 --> 02:32:17,520
product which is absolutely horrifying

3677
02:32:15,359 --> 02:32:20,079
to me that if we have an educated

3678
02:32:17,520 --> 02:32:22,439
sensory approach that then we'll have a

3679
02:32:20,079 --> 02:32:24,478
lot more uptake there so one last bit is

3680
02:32:22,439 --> 02:32:26,760
that the cultivation classic has data

3681
02:32:24,478 --> 02:32:28,639
over the last couple of years that Dr ad

3682
02:32:26,760 --> 02:32:30,559
Ray Jeremy sacket and myself will be

3683
02:32:28,639 --> 02:32:32,760
coming forward with shortly that looks

3684
02:32:30,559 --> 02:32:34,639
at that population Dynamic that's I've

3685
02:32:32,760 --> 02:32:37,840
already described that one of the cool

3686
02:32:34,639 --> 02:32:40,358
findings was that aoma intensity when

3687
02:32:37,840 --> 02:32:43,079
blinded and randomized was by far the

3688
02:32:40,359 --> 02:32:45,800
most important qualitative attribute in

3689
02:32:43,079 --> 02:32:48,359
cannabis um when blinded and randomized

3690
02:32:45,799 --> 02:32:51,519
seven out of 10 people would always

3691
02:32:48,359 --> 02:32:53,359
choose varieties that were under 20% THC

3692
02:32:51,520 --> 02:32:55,359
that is exactly the inverse of what's

3693
02:32:53,359 --> 02:32:57,640
happening in wholesale and now in the

3694
02:32:55,359 --> 02:32:59,960
new scaling production environment so I

3695
02:32:57,639 --> 02:33:01,760
just want to pay an homage to all the

3696
02:32:59,959 --> 02:33:04,358
sensory scientists and the people who

3697
02:33:01,760 --> 02:33:06,559
are working to describe in a pretty

3698
02:33:04,359 --> 02:33:08,359
objective fashion that element and then

3699
02:33:06,559 --> 02:33:10,760
that to counterbalance the amazing

3700
02:33:08,359 --> 02:33:13,000
analytic work to ultimately open the

3701
02:33:10,760 --> 02:33:15,639
door to more product diversity more

3702
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:17,559
product enjoyment a deeper connection to

3703
02:33:15,639 --> 02:33:20,000
the diversity of the product and not

3704
02:33:17,559 --> 02:33:22,959
just get stuck in Fruit floral fuel or

3705
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:24,920
sort of like massive archetypal sort of

3706
02:33:22,959 --> 02:33:26,919
descriptions and missing all of this

3707
02:33:24,920 --> 02:33:29,040
Nuance especially that's coming out of

3708
02:33:26,920 --> 02:33:31,279
the organically grown products which I

3709
02:33:29,040 --> 02:33:33,640
consistently experience as exactly as

3710
02:33:31,279 --> 02:33:35,239
Mark described uh slightly less

3711
02:33:33,639 --> 02:33:38,159
cannabinoids potentially although I

3712
02:33:35,239 --> 02:33:40,119
routinely I'm getting up to 34% total

3713
02:33:38,159 --> 02:33:42,439
canabo in many varieties that we're

3714
02:33:40,120 --> 02:33:45,920
cultivating but in general lower but

3715
02:33:42,439 --> 02:33:49,279
more diverse more sensuous more present

3716
02:33:45,920 --> 02:33:50,520
more evocative few thoughts there yeah

3717
02:33:49,279 --> 02:33:52,760
man

3718
02:33:50,520 --> 02:33:56,439
when you talk like that Jeremy that

3719
02:33:52,760 --> 02:33:58,639
you're just really in total um alignment

3720
02:33:56,439 --> 02:34:01,120
with what exactly what I was saying

3721
02:33:58,639 --> 02:34:04,439
before with if we're rolling up a chair

3722
02:34:01,120 --> 02:34:06,319
for the plant and we're asking the plant

3723
02:34:04,439 --> 02:34:09,680
what is it that she would like to come

3724
02:34:06,318 --> 02:34:12,359
out with it is you know quantifying in

3725
02:34:09,680 --> 02:34:15,920
all of those different expressions and

3726
02:34:12,359 --> 02:34:18,439
in that same way we find that full

3727
02:34:15,920 --> 02:34:20,520
expression when we put her in deep soil

3728
02:34:18,439 --> 02:34:22,398
when we put her out in the sun she is

3729
02:34:20,520 --> 02:34:24,960
able to have those full natural

3730
02:34:22,398 --> 02:34:28,519
Expressions because her ultimate

3731
02:34:24,959 --> 02:34:31,879
potential is fully ripe at the full

3732
02:34:28,520 --> 02:34:35,600
expression during fall when we have all

3733
02:34:31,879 --> 02:34:39,079
of the microb biome in full expression

3734
02:34:35,600 --> 02:34:41,840
yeah all of these things then fall into

3735
02:34:39,079 --> 02:34:43,840
full Harmony and holistic expression of

3736
02:34:41,840 --> 02:34:45,840
the plant and I think that that's really

3737
02:34:43,840 --> 02:34:47,719
important with with what you're talking

3738
02:34:45,840 --> 02:34:50,439
about and really quickly when you were

3739
02:34:47,719 --> 02:34:52,159
saying about drying that is also you

3740
02:34:50,439 --> 02:34:54,880
know what we are following here on the

3741
02:34:52,159 --> 02:34:57,039
farm but it's also what's happening in a

3742
02:34:54,879 --> 02:34:59,839
natural expression when you let your

3743
02:34:57,040 --> 02:35:02,240
plants go to full fruition there's a lot

3744
02:34:59,840 --> 02:35:05,760
of moisture in the air during the fall

3745
02:35:02,239 --> 02:35:09,559
time and then when you bring it into a

3746
02:35:05,760 --> 02:35:12,760
5050 or a 6060 you are going to get that

3747
02:35:09,559 --> 02:35:16,879
quick dry and then that prolonged sort

3748
02:35:12,760 --> 02:35:19,120
of balanced expression of a good cure so

3749
02:35:16,879 --> 02:35:20,799
thank you for uh talking about that I

3750
02:35:19,120 --> 02:35:22,800
think it's not natur Al happening as

3751
02:35:20,799 --> 02:35:24,000
well and Dr Lewis you can say something

3752
02:35:22,799 --> 02:35:26,679
on this too in a sec I was just

3753
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:28,559
wondering that the the tpin are higher

3754
02:35:26,680 --> 02:35:30,520
in the organic you know or the

3755
02:35:28,559 --> 02:35:32,439
regenerative Gran and maybe the

3756
02:35:30,520 --> 02:35:34,479
cannaboids are lower but do the tpin

3757
02:35:32,439 --> 02:35:36,439
make the cannabinoids more powerful I

3758
02:35:34,478 --> 02:35:40,159
mean I I would think Ethan Russo or

3759
02:35:36,439 --> 02:35:43,200
someone would also well you said

3760
02:35:40,159 --> 02:35:45,879
remember our analysis were with the same

3761
02:35:43,200 --> 02:35:49,359
genotypes when I make that assertion

3762
02:35:45,879 --> 02:35:51,398
that lower canono in general and higher

3763
02:35:49,359 --> 02:35:54,120
and more more robust terpenoids in

3764
02:35:51,398 --> 02:35:55,559
general that's comparing the same plant

3765
02:35:54,120 --> 02:35:56,720
to each other in the two different

3766
02:35:55,559 --> 02:35:59,278
environments I want to make sure to

3767
02:35:56,719 --> 02:36:01,358
distinct that it's not in overall

3768
02:35:59,279 --> 02:36:04,359
because if you have you know something

3769
02:36:01,359 --> 02:36:06,600
that naturally produces 30% canabo it's

3770
02:36:04,359 --> 02:36:08,159
still going to get almost 30% canabo

3771
02:36:06,600 --> 02:36:09,760
it's just going to be in general a

3772
02:36:08,159 --> 02:36:13,039
little bit lower and their tpine

3773
02:36:09,760 --> 02:36:16,120
profiles will be a little bit higher and

3774
02:36:13,040 --> 02:36:18,600
one thing that we didn't talk about with

3775
02:36:16,120 --> 02:36:21,399
respect to you know pres preservation of

3776
02:36:18,600 --> 02:36:25,120
tpine profile is genetics has a

3777
02:36:21,398 --> 02:36:27,398
contribution to how a plant cures one of

3778
02:36:25,120 --> 02:36:29,040
the biggest problems that we experienced

3779
02:36:27,398 --> 02:36:32,000
in the early days of breeding the

3780
02:36:29,040 --> 02:36:35,439
enhanced flowers which that contain the

3781
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:37,719
CBD is that they'd turn gold really fast

3782
02:36:35,439 --> 02:36:40,318
like it it was you know so we were we

3783
02:36:37,719 --> 02:36:42,799
tried to get the you know TOA forall

3784
02:36:40,318 --> 02:36:44,680
content up to preserve that shelf life

3785
02:36:42,799 --> 02:36:47,679
so they stay a little bit Greener and

3786
02:36:44,680 --> 02:36:51,040
and brighter and more poppy but also

3787
02:36:47,680 --> 02:36:52,639
some things if you store them uh they'll

3788
02:36:51,040 --> 02:36:55,319
turn they'll kind of start smelling like

3789
02:36:52,639 --> 02:36:57,719
wine or you know kind of kind of smell

3790
02:36:55,318 --> 02:37:00,119
old really fast while other things

3791
02:36:57,719 --> 02:37:02,278
preserve really well and overall the

3792
02:37:00,120 --> 02:37:05,359
best way to preserve anything is as soon

3793
02:37:02,279 --> 02:37:06,760
as it's dried to just freeze it and then

3794
02:37:05,359 --> 02:37:08,680
you pull it out of the freezer a year

3795
02:37:06,760 --> 02:37:11,398
later it's still going to smell fresh

3796
02:37:08,680 --> 02:37:13,600
and gassy like an OG um but you have to

3797
02:37:11,398 --> 02:37:15,239
have it sealed properly or else it can

3798
02:37:13,600 --> 02:37:16,439
collect water moisture and all those

3799
02:37:15,239 --> 02:37:18,159
different things and don't open the

3800
02:37:16,439 --> 02:37:20,159
freezer a whole lot all that kind of

3801
02:37:18,159 --> 02:37:22,159
stuff so

3802
02:37:20,159 --> 02:37:23,799
well it helps to displace the oxygen

3803
02:37:22,159 --> 02:37:26,680
doesn't it

3804
02:37:23,799 --> 02:37:29,000
Mark it does but it depends on the size

3805
02:37:26,680 --> 02:37:31,520
of your container and the amount of free

3806
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:33,159
space because if you have a really large

3807
02:37:31,520 --> 02:37:34,600
container that's really full to the rim

3808
02:37:33,159 --> 02:37:35,799
and you don't have a whole lot of oxygen

3809
02:37:34,600 --> 02:37:37,960
it's not going to get harmed a whole

3810
02:37:35,799 --> 02:37:39,959
bunch or if you pull out that oxygen

3811
02:37:37,959 --> 02:37:42,438
it's going to obviously preserve better

3812
02:37:39,959 --> 02:37:44,559
right and you know we've done studies

3813
02:37:42,439 --> 02:37:48,159
where you know we use nitrogen or argon

3814
02:37:44,559 --> 02:37:50,879
to you know displace the oxygen but

3815
02:37:48,159 --> 02:37:53,439
really if it's stored properly the

3816
02:37:50,879 --> 02:37:55,478
differences are relatively insignificant

3817
02:37:53,439 --> 02:37:58,000
it's actually you see in our experience

3818
02:37:55,478 --> 02:38:01,438
you see more changes in the

3819
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:04,239
TCA uh to THC conversion than you do in

3820
02:38:01,439 --> 02:38:07,680
the tpine nose if you store it properly

3821
02:38:04,239 --> 02:38:10,478
of course well I I know that in the not

3822
02:38:07,680 --> 02:38:12,800
that it's related but in the potato chip

3823
02:38:10,478 --> 02:38:15,039
um industry they've they've switched to

3824
02:38:12,799 --> 02:38:16,920
now blowing up those potato chip bags

3825
02:38:15,040 --> 02:38:19,960
with nitrogen because what they find is

3826
02:38:16,920 --> 02:38:24,159
that the nitrogen does blanket you know

3827
02:38:19,959 --> 02:38:27,959
the the uh I guess the polyunsaturates

3828
02:38:24,159 --> 02:38:30,600
in potato chips that would degrade and

3829
02:38:27,959 --> 02:38:33,199
create you know oxidative degradated

3830
02:38:30,600 --> 02:38:35,159
smells and other aldah and other [ __ ]

3831
02:38:33,200 --> 02:38:37,279
like that I'm sure it would be the same

3832
02:38:35,159 --> 02:38:40,600
thing with canvas maybe much to a much

3833
02:38:37,279 --> 02:38:42,319
lesser extent than say potato chips

3834
02:38:40,600 --> 02:38:44,640
right well think about a potato chip

3835
02:38:42,318 --> 02:38:47,119
it's like the maximum surface area

3836
02:38:44,639 --> 02:38:50,840
possible right so and you think about a

3837
02:38:47,120 --> 02:38:53,439
bud it's it's all compact typically and

3838
02:38:50,840 --> 02:38:55,760
most of the flavor and compounds are

3839
02:38:53,439 --> 02:38:57,000
protected by the triome and the cuticle

3840
02:38:55,760 --> 02:38:59,000
so you have a couple layers of

3841
02:38:57,000 --> 02:39:00,359
protection there and and actually that's

3842
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:02,478
that's one of the things that we did for

3843
02:39:00,359 --> 02:39:05,640
a client about eight years ago is

3844
02:39:02,478 --> 02:39:08,959
started uh they started using different

3845
02:39:05,639 --> 02:39:10,639
um the sorbent bags that like you know

3846
02:39:08,959 --> 02:39:12,919
nuts come in and stuff and they would

3847
02:39:10,639 --> 02:39:15,680
blow them up and only fill them up about

3848
02:39:12,920 --> 02:39:18,000
halfway so that you couldn't you could

3849
02:39:15,680 --> 02:39:19,680
not squeeze it to crush the bud you know

3850
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:21,359
whereas with turkey bags they spin them

3851
02:39:19,680 --> 02:39:23,680
all down and pull them tight and smash

3852
02:39:21,359 --> 02:39:26,120
them into duffel bags or whatever and

3853
02:39:23,680 --> 02:39:28,318
that really helped with preserving the

3854
02:39:26,120 --> 02:39:30,720
uh Aroma as well because you weren't

3855
02:39:28,318 --> 02:39:33,799
destroying the physical structure that

3856
02:39:30,719 --> 02:39:35,840
encased the aroma and and the molecules

3857
02:39:33,799 --> 02:39:37,879
it's funny you bring up the nitrogen we

3858
02:39:35,840 --> 02:39:39,960
actually switched to nitrogen sealed

3859
02:39:37,879 --> 02:39:42,358
packaging about three years ago with our

3860
02:39:39,959 --> 02:39:45,639
Collective um it changed the game

3861
02:39:42,359 --> 02:39:47,200
completely for us and for me as a buyer

3862
02:39:45,639 --> 02:39:50,079
um you know we went from housing

3863
02:39:47,200 --> 02:39:52,840
probably 15 to 20 cultivars to at 1

3864
02:39:50,079 --> 02:39:56,120
point4 regulation I think we had 108

3865
02:39:52,840 --> 02:39:57,719
cultivars on the Shelf um how long are

3866
02:39:56,120 --> 02:39:59,200
you how long are you storing those

3867
02:39:57,719 --> 02:40:00,879
packages so the things that you're

3868
02:39:59,200 --> 02:40:02,880
putting under nitrogen how long are they

3869
02:40:00,879 --> 02:40:05,278
in storage for before they're opened up

3870
02:40:02,879 --> 02:40:08,358
again and are they at room temperature

3871
02:40:05,279 --> 02:40:10,520
sure no yeah so we keep those uh we keep

3872
02:40:08,359 --> 02:40:12,840
those in a temperature controlled Vault

3873
02:40:10,520 --> 02:40:14,960
um obviously just to help with retention

3874
02:40:12,840 --> 02:40:16,398
there we've seen and we've done studies

3875
02:40:14,959 --> 02:40:20,119
I mean I've opened cans that were two

3876
02:40:16,398 --> 02:40:21,639
years old and still had a crazy nose and

3877
02:40:20,120 --> 02:40:25,279
um you know we're we're out of this

3878
02:40:21,639 --> 02:40:26,959
world it took a long time to um gain the

3879
02:40:25,279 --> 02:40:28,399
consumer trust because they're used to

3880
02:40:26,959 --> 02:40:30,679
opening and seeing and being able to

3881
02:40:28,398 --> 02:40:33,879
look at that but for us as far as being

3882
02:40:30,680 --> 02:40:35,359
able to um create consistency for the

3883
02:40:33,879 --> 02:40:37,478
consumer as far as being able to

3884
02:40:35,359 --> 02:40:40,880
purchase enough to have it be stable on

3885
02:40:37,478 --> 02:40:43,000
the Shelf um and also um add variety it

3886
02:40:40,879 --> 02:40:45,920
is was game changer for us um you know

3887
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:47,959
it allows me to buy more um and and also

3888
02:40:45,920 --> 02:40:51,000
we can house it a little longer and and

3889
02:40:47,959 --> 02:40:52,478
we've seen you know um retention there

3890
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:54,600
with the tpin it's kind of out of this

3891
02:40:52,478 --> 02:40:56,639
world it's it's sealed you know and with

3892
02:40:54,600 --> 02:40:58,920
the jars you see with glass and anything

3893
02:40:56,639 --> 02:41:01,239
else it's still dis dissipating oxygen

3894
02:40:58,920 --> 02:41:03,279
they're not completely sealed and so uh

3895
02:41:01,239 --> 02:41:05,439
it's a ticking time bomb and we all know

3896
02:41:03,279 --> 02:41:08,000
how hard supply chain is um on the

3897
02:41:05,439 --> 02:41:11,318
retail side most times when I see

3898
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:13,279
something that is a sample um I feel so

3899
02:41:11,318 --> 02:41:16,278
bad for the farmer Because by the time

3900
02:41:13,279 --> 02:41:18,359
it's to me uh like Dr Le was saying it's

3901
02:41:16,279 --> 02:41:21,000
either um oxidized to a point where

3902
02:41:18,359 --> 02:41:22,479
maybe it's gold there um those tpin

3903
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:23,600
start to change to like narid dool and

3904
02:41:22,478 --> 02:41:26,679
some of the other ones that are a little

3905
02:41:23,600 --> 02:41:28,120
less appealing um so it's um it's a race

3906
02:41:26,680 --> 02:41:31,439
against the clock the whole time for the

3907
02:41:28,120 --> 02:41:32,560
tpin um luckily for us uh we have a

3908
02:41:31,439 --> 02:41:34,239
situation where we're a little more

3909
02:41:32,559 --> 02:41:36,519
vertically integrated I'm allowed to

3910
02:41:34,239 --> 02:41:38,478
work with the farmer directly um we have

3911
02:41:36,520 --> 02:41:41,200
our own distribution that packages one

3912
02:41:38,478 --> 02:41:43,318
door down from the retail so once you

3913
02:41:41,200 --> 02:41:46,439
know um you know really just having the

3914
02:41:43,318 --> 02:41:48,359
Sops in place to make sure that um you

3915
02:41:46,439 --> 02:41:49,720
know your your dryness levels the

3916
02:41:48,359 --> 02:41:52,159
moisture the humidity everything in the

3917
02:41:49,719 --> 02:41:53,879
room when your packaging is ideal um it

3918
02:41:52,159 --> 02:41:55,719
all takes place and making sure that you

3919
02:41:53,879 --> 02:41:57,879
can retain that

3920
02:41:55,719 --> 02:42:00,199
tpine

3921
02:41:57,879 --> 02:42:03,679
yeah oh sorry I was just gonna say

3922
02:42:00,200 --> 02:42:06,319
something totally obvious is uh you know

3923
02:42:03,680 --> 02:42:10,120
bridging that communication from the

3924
02:42:06,318 --> 02:42:12,119
farmer to the packager to the final you

3925
02:42:10,120 --> 02:42:15,359
know person that's going to sell it even

3926
02:42:12,120 --> 02:42:18,600
the bud tenders because what what you

3927
02:42:15,359 --> 02:42:21,520
just said Mark about you know different

3928
02:42:18,600 --> 02:42:24,800
variet have different needs and how we

3929
02:42:21,520 --> 02:42:28,279
want to preserve them and as Growers we

3930
02:42:24,799 --> 02:42:30,959
really understand that we know that you

3931
02:42:28,279 --> 02:42:33,079
know certain open varietals might be

3932
02:42:30,959 --> 02:42:34,639
drying faster they need to be more

3933
02:42:33,079 --> 02:42:37,478
upfront and that's something that we

3934
02:42:34,639 --> 02:42:39,318
could really pass on that information

3935
02:42:37,478 --> 02:42:41,639
all the way to the bud tender so that

3936
02:42:39,318 --> 02:42:44,478
they even know how to touch it in the

3937
02:42:41,639 --> 02:42:46,559
very end so I I know this is really

3938
02:42:44,478 --> 02:42:49,239
obvious but I love it that we're even

3939
02:42:46,559 --> 02:42:51,519
having little drips of conversations

3940
02:42:49,239 --> 02:42:53,600
here of having that bridging

3941
02:42:51,520 --> 02:42:55,960
communication all the way back to the

3942
02:42:53,600 --> 02:42:57,000
farmer because I think we really have an

3943
02:42:55,959 --> 02:43:00,239
understanding of all those different

3944
02:42:57,000 --> 02:43:03,840
varietals from a different view from the

3945
02:43:00,239 --> 02:43:06,520
packager and the distributor of them so

3946
02:43:03,840 --> 02:43:08,318
I love this I I love Kelly we were just

3947
02:43:06,520 --> 02:43:09,640
on the same wavelength I I was just

3948
02:43:08,318 --> 02:43:11,559
thinking the other part of the

3949
02:43:09,639 --> 02:43:14,119
connection is when consumers and

3950
02:43:11,559 --> 02:43:16,359
patients are going to retail and saying

3951
02:43:14,120 --> 02:43:18,040
gosh if you have that big jar of flour

3952
02:43:16,359 --> 02:43:20,279
with all of the breakage on the bottom

3953
02:43:18,040 --> 02:43:22,439
under lights and you're taking more than

3954
02:43:20,279 --> 02:43:24,760
a week to go through that inventory this

3955
02:43:22,439 --> 02:43:27,079
is disrespectful to the farmer to the

3956
02:43:24,760 --> 02:43:29,239
plants to the whole equation and that

3957
02:43:27,079 --> 02:43:32,039
there needs to be some reconciliation

3958
02:43:29,239 --> 02:43:35,119
around how even that last point in the

3959
02:43:32,040 --> 02:43:37,800
chain works I know at Pharma I created a

3960
02:43:35,120 --> 02:43:39,800
Russian nesting doll strategy where it

3961
02:43:37,799 --> 02:43:42,079
had to be a series of progressively

3962
02:43:39,799 --> 02:43:44,679
smaller containers all to the point

3963
02:43:42,079 --> 02:43:46,760
where never would we expose the flower

3964
02:43:44,680 --> 02:43:48,559
to the environment if it wasn't an

3965
02:43:46,760 --> 02:43:50,359
amount we were going to go through in

3966
02:43:48,559 --> 02:43:51,639
that day and interestingly I don't know

3967
02:43:50,359 --> 02:43:54,000
if everybody knows but Oregon is

3968
02:43:51,639 --> 02:43:56,278
actually the only sort of deli style

3969
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:58,520
Market where we don't have forced pre

3970
02:43:56,279 --> 02:44:00,960
packaging which was a battle that I won

3971
02:43:58,520 --> 02:44:03,279
at the OLCC roeming advisory committee

3972
02:44:00,959 --> 02:44:04,799
there was many I lost but I did get that

3973
02:44:03,279 --> 02:44:07,159
unfortunately in the pandemic that's

3974
02:44:04,799 --> 02:44:10,278
kind of out the window but the idea that

3975
02:44:07,159 --> 02:44:12,000
you can connect people to Aroma and

3976
02:44:10,279 --> 02:44:14,239
actually View and connect with the

3977
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:16,920
product is a really important part of I

3978
02:44:14,239 --> 02:44:18,719
think the selection process but back to

3979
02:44:16,920 --> 02:44:20,639
uh I think the Russian nesting doll

3980
02:44:18,719 --> 02:44:22,719
strategy is one Element another thing

3981
02:44:20,639 --> 02:44:25,398
that we've tried I've ordered pickle

3982
02:44:22,719 --> 02:44:27,760
jars off of sort of like Alibaba that

3983
02:44:25,398 --> 02:44:30,199
are stainless steel that have clasps

3984
02:44:27,760 --> 02:44:32,760
that can fit a half pound and enough

3985
02:44:30,200 --> 02:44:34,640
room to then we've used a mixed gas I

3986
02:44:32,760 --> 02:44:37,680
was in Chile working with my friend

3987
02:44:34,639 --> 02:44:39,199
Pablo Mendes at diam three years ago and

3988
02:44:37,680 --> 02:44:42,000
they had some really interesting food

3989
02:44:39,200 --> 02:44:44,399
scientists and Mark or Dr Lewis I don't

3990
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:47,439
know if um you might know more but their

3991
02:44:44,398 --> 02:44:50,840
strategy was to have an 8020 80%

3992
02:44:47,439 --> 02:44:53,279
nitrogen 20% CO2 and they claimed that

3993
02:44:50,840 --> 02:44:56,279
that addition of the CO2 actually helped

3994
02:44:53,279 --> 02:44:57,960
to suppress fungal pathogen over time

3995
02:44:56,279 --> 02:44:59,600
and that there was a lot of food packing

3996
02:44:57,959 --> 02:45:01,519
that was using that solution in South

3997
02:44:59,600 --> 02:45:03,880
America so we just adopted that I

3998
02:45:01,520 --> 02:45:06,159
haven't seen a lot of data to support or

3999
02:45:03,879 --> 02:45:08,199
substantiate that but then I like this

4000
02:45:06,159 --> 02:45:10,279
idea of packing small increments we

4001
02:45:08,200 --> 02:45:12,000
wanted to create a reuse program and buy

4002
02:45:10,279 --> 02:45:14,359
these containers and then have a

4003
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:18,200
sanitation process where we would drop

4004
02:45:14,359 --> 02:45:20,760
only in 228 gram increments all so like

4005
02:45:18,200 --> 02:45:23,159
mountain of these like containers into

4006
02:45:20,760 --> 02:45:25,239
the retails and then request those

4007
02:45:23,159 --> 02:45:27,359
containers back unfortunately it was

4008
02:45:25,239 --> 02:45:29,559
literally I kept running into compliance

4009
02:45:27,359 --> 02:45:31,840
issues and the sanitation issue was a

4010
02:45:29,559 --> 02:45:33,719
big cost in terms of getting the kind of

4011
02:45:31,840 --> 02:45:35,359
equipment that you need to clean that

4012
02:45:33,719 --> 02:45:37,559
it's just that we're really in this

4013
02:45:35,359 --> 02:45:39,000
conundrum right now with packaging and

4014
02:45:37,559 --> 02:45:40,879
thankfully actually one other little

4015
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:43,040
highlight is that in the last year for

4016
02:45:40,879 --> 02:45:45,239
the first time uh if you're aware of

4017
02:45:43,040 --> 02:45:46,880
sauna packaging there's a few people who

4018
02:45:45,239 --> 02:45:49,318
are working with like you know

4019
02:45:46,879 --> 02:45:51,759
compostable packaging with uh recycled

4020
02:45:49,318 --> 02:45:53,719
ocean plastic with 100% postc consumer

4021
02:45:51,760 --> 02:45:56,318
stuff and you know it's there's at least

4022
02:45:53,719 --> 02:45:59,079
some options that just in the last year

4023
02:45:56,318 --> 02:46:02,079
are now cost effective maybe it's only

4024
02:45:59,079 --> 02:46:04,520
like 2x the cost of the Dube tube that

4025
02:46:02,079 --> 02:46:06,439
is the crap that fills the landfill but

4026
02:46:04,520 --> 02:46:07,960
as companies are starting to feel

4027
02:46:06,439 --> 02:46:10,279
pressure from consumers that are

4028
02:46:07,959 --> 02:46:12,639
informed my hope would be that nobody is

4029
02:46:10,279 --> 02:46:14,399
going to be able to make a bottomline

4030
02:46:12,639 --> 02:46:15,840
decision with regard to this

4031
02:46:14,398 --> 02:46:19,680
unbelievable waste stream that the

4032
02:46:15,840 --> 02:46:20,960
industry has just created um

4033
02:46:19,680 --> 02:46:23,120
I think what you're you're illustrating

4034
02:46:20,959 --> 02:46:25,519
is something you know me on the East

4035
02:46:23,120 --> 02:46:28,640
Coast it's it's we don't have this this

4036
02:46:25,520 --> 02:46:32,200
luxury of deli style or the badega style

4037
02:46:28,639 --> 02:46:35,199
um you know experience so to speak it's

4038
02:46:32,200 --> 02:46:36,920
it is a cpg world so we have to look at

4039
02:46:35,200 --> 02:46:40,720
the supply chain and then we have we

4040
02:46:36,920 --> 02:46:43,879
have ratios of medical versus wreck that

4041
02:46:40,719 --> 02:46:46,840
we have to keep at all times and it just

4042
02:46:43,879 --> 02:46:49,959
forces us in a regulatory way to have to

4043
02:46:46,840 --> 02:46:52,040
to to package you know we chose to go

4044
02:46:49,959 --> 02:46:54,519
with glass I chose with you know to

4045
02:46:52,040 --> 02:46:57,040
induction seal and to try to do the best

4046
02:46:54,520 --> 02:46:58,760
that I could but I don't you know like

4047
02:46:57,040 --> 02:47:00,840
you're illustrating we just we have so

4048
02:46:58,760 --> 02:47:03,439
many things we have to look at what is

4049
02:47:00,840 --> 02:47:05,478
enough to package how many batches do we

4050
02:47:03,439 --> 02:47:08,559
really go through a day do we really

4051
02:47:05,478 --> 02:47:10,760
need to have all this packaged up um you

4052
02:47:08,559 --> 02:47:13,159
know all really valid questions and I

4053
02:47:10,760 --> 02:47:16,639
think you know for myself it's it's

4054
02:47:13,159 --> 02:47:18,600
really hard because I see a totally

4055
02:47:16,639 --> 02:47:21,920
different product behind the scenes that

4056
02:47:18,600 --> 02:47:24,040
I see my customer walk away with and

4057
02:47:21,920 --> 02:47:26,879
it's just a really hard thing to go

4058
02:47:24,040 --> 02:47:29,319
through because yeah we're we're we're

4059
02:47:26,879 --> 02:47:30,639
essentially packaging up you know dying

4060
02:47:29,318 --> 02:47:32,799
flowers you know things that are

4061
02:47:30,639 --> 02:47:35,119
changing composition as it's sitting

4062
02:47:32,799 --> 02:47:37,159
there right before our eyes so it's it's

4063
02:47:35,120 --> 02:47:38,960
a really tough tough thing you know I'm

4064
02:47:37,159 --> 02:47:41,760
always looking at new containers like I

4065
02:47:38,959 --> 02:47:43,759
have this caly container here while I

4066
02:47:41,760 --> 02:47:46,960
really love where their heads at I want

4067
02:47:43,760 --> 02:47:49,800
to see it glass you know like it's got a

4068
02:47:46,959 --> 02:47:52,398
seal and has this I idea where you can

4069
02:47:49,799 --> 02:47:56,519
you know snap it shut so you know we

4070
02:47:52,398 --> 02:47:58,519
have our our CR right here so it's

4071
02:47:56,520 --> 02:48:00,920
there's a lot of people thinking about

4072
02:47:58,520 --> 02:48:02,600
this but I think we just you know we've

4073
02:48:00,920 --> 02:48:05,120
got to keep pushing to get glass we've

4074
02:48:02,600 --> 02:48:09,479
got to get keep pushing to get reusables

4075
02:48:05,120 --> 02:48:12,240
here we go nice so yeah so if yeah and

4076
02:48:09,478 --> 02:48:14,760
what you're talking about um Jeremy is

4077
02:48:12,239 --> 02:48:16,559
amazing I use those in the lab for any

4078
02:48:14,760 --> 02:48:18,960
oil that I've made it's like immediately

4079
02:48:16,559 --> 02:48:21,600
I'll do that to preserve to try to try

4080
02:48:18,959 --> 02:48:25,000
to um then put that in refrigeration or

4081
02:48:21,600 --> 02:48:27,920
a a you know refriger a freezer if you

4082
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:30,680
will so I think we're in this conundrum

4083
02:48:27,920 --> 02:48:33,439
right now where we have this amazing

4084
02:48:30,680 --> 02:48:35,680
behind the scenes uh efforts happening

4085
02:48:33,439 --> 02:48:40,359
that are then like you're illustrating

4086
02:48:35,680 --> 02:48:43,279
Jeremy just quite simply being uh being

4087
02:48:40,359 --> 02:48:45,239
not uh represented at at a at a retail

4088
02:48:43,279 --> 02:48:47,359
level so it's it's really heartbreaking

4089
02:48:45,239 --> 02:48:49,920
in some respect and I know I go through

4090
02:48:47,359 --> 02:48:52,520
that with my hash all the time

4091
02:48:49,920 --> 02:48:54,920
where it's you know I can only do so

4092
02:48:52,520 --> 02:48:58,279
much it's a cold chain item you know

4093
02:48:54,920 --> 02:49:01,079
yeah it's a huge conundrum because we as

4094
02:48:58,279 --> 02:49:04,000
the consumer level we see more people

4095
02:49:01,079 --> 02:49:06,000
just putting things in a jar whereas the

4096
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:09,040
jar is this big and the products this

4097
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:11,959
big so you're left with an overabundance

4098
02:49:09,040 --> 02:49:14,319
of you know decomposition due to the

4099
02:49:11,959 --> 02:49:16,759
oxygen then that's left in there and how

4100
02:49:14,318 --> 02:49:18,719
few and I think Joe can probably attest

4101
02:49:16,760 --> 02:49:21,520
this is how few people are actually

4102
02:49:18,719 --> 02:49:23,358
doing any type of nitrogen spiking or

4103
02:49:21,520 --> 02:49:25,399
that 8020 that you were talking about

4104
02:49:23,359 --> 02:49:26,760
Jeremy which I think is is very

4105
02:49:25,398 --> 02:49:29,000
fascinating because some people were

4106
02:49:26,760 --> 02:49:31,478
playing early on with nitrogen and they

4107
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:34,760
were concerned of degradation and there

4108
02:49:31,478 --> 02:49:38,438
was some degradation depending on ratio

4109
02:49:34,760 --> 02:49:40,960
so uh I love the concept of the 8020 but

4110
02:49:38,439 --> 02:49:44,200
again still the consumer in California

4111
02:49:40,959 --> 02:49:45,199
majority of what they get is very dry

4112
02:49:44,200 --> 02:49:48,040
very

4113
02:49:45,200 --> 02:49:50,520
unfortunately over oxygenated product so

4114
02:49:48,040 --> 02:49:52,800
that they don't get an actual

4115
02:49:50,520 --> 02:49:55,319
representation really depending on when

4116
02:49:52,799 --> 02:49:57,679
that comes to Market of what that flower

4117
02:49:55,318 --> 02:50:00,039
expression fully is and that's a shame

4118
02:49:57,680 --> 02:50:01,639
you're 100% correct it's um it is a

4119
02:50:00,040 --> 02:50:03,640
shame I mean you just think about the

4120
02:50:01,639 --> 02:50:06,000
supply chain and how many cooks are in

4121
02:50:03,639 --> 02:50:08,318
the kitchen right you have you have to

4122
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:10,318
bring it into from the you know the

4123
02:50:08,318 --> 02:50:12,278
cultivator to distribution then

4124
02:50:10,318 --> 02:50:14,199
depending on the distributor's Sops and

4125
02:50:12,279 --> 02:50:15,720
how they handle the flower then you have

4126
02:50:14,200 --> 02:50:17,159
to schedule it with the lab then you

4127
02:50:15,719 --> 02:50:18,920
have to wait for the lab to come then

4128
02:50:17,159 --> 02:50:20,318
the lab touches the flower then it goes

4129
02:50:18,920 --> 02:50:22,398
back into quarantine then it comes out

4130
02:50:20,318 --> 02:50:24,639
of quarantine so you're getting touched

4131
02:50:22,398 --> 02:50:26,439
and moved over from different climates

4132
02:50:24,639 --> 02:50:29,358
and different areas throughout the whole

4133
02:50:26,439 --> 02:50:32,040
entire process and unfortunately not

4134
02:50:29,359 --> 02:50:34,439
everyone um as as a good fortune as we

4135
02:50:32,040 --> 02:50:35,600
are to have been vertically integrated

4136
02:50:34,439 --> 02:50:38,159
you know there's a lot of people that

4137
02:50:35,600 --> 02:50:40,880
just don't have that and so being able

4138
02:50:38,159 --> 02:50:42,680
to tell that story um like you guys were

4139
02:50:40,879 --> 02:50:44,199
talking about earlier of the plant and

4140
02:50:42,680 --> 02:50:46,398
of the cultivators you know it's really

4141
02:50:44,200 --> 02:50:48,640
about establishing those relationships

4142
02:50:46,398 --> 02:50:50,000
and and really trying to um get that

4143
02:50:48,639 --> 02:50:51,478
flower to Market where you're really

4144
02:50:50,000 --> 02:50:53,680
giving it the true representation of

4145
02:50:51,478 --> 02:50:56,159
what that plant's supposed to be um it

4146
02:50:53,680 --> 02:50:58,680
is frustrating especially with taxes uh

4147
02:50:56,159 --> 02:51:00,920
in the state to see these eights go out

4148
02:50:58,680 --> 02:51:02,800
the door where yeah they half the jar

4149
02:51:00,920 --> 02:51:04,120
three a quarter of the jar is full you

4150
02:51:02,799 --> 02:51:06,438
have all the air in there you have the

4151
02:51:04,120 --> 02:51:08,200
tax you open it up and it's uh it's gone

4152
02:51:06,439 --> 02:51:11,238
it's dry it's dust you can't even roll a

4153
02:51:08,200 --> 02:51:13,479
joint and so yeah it's a shame um I

4154
02:51:11,238 --> 02:51:14,920
don't think a lot of The Growers who are

4155
02:51:13,478 --> 02:51:16,559
just getting purchased out they don't

4156
02:51:14,920 --> 02:51:19,000
even get they they don't see what their

4157
02:51:16,559 --> 02:51:21,000
flower looks like on the end result and

4158
02:51:19,000 --> 02:51:23,799
uh so really it's just that battle

4159
02:51:21,000 --> 02:51:25,719
against the clock on top of that it's

4160
02:51:23,799 --> 02:51:27,358
you know and I think this is a terrible

4161
02:51:25,719 --> 02:51:28,879
Injustice you know there's four

4162
02:51:27,359 --> 02:51:31,559
universities here in the United States

4163
02:51:28,879 --> 02:51:33,799
that teach packaging and one's here at

4164
02:51:31,559 --> 02:51:36,199
San Jose State University and so they

4165
02:51:33,799 --> 02:51:38,679
actually have a nitrogen infusing

4166
02:51:36,200 --> 02:51:40,399
machine right there in the classroom

4167
02:51:38,680 --> 02:51:43,120
just to show them how they actually do

4168
02:51:40,398 --> 02:51:45,238
coffee and we were discussing that

4169
02:51:43,120 --> 02:51:47,040
literally a decade ago on infusing that

4170
02:51:45,238 --> 02:51:49,119
with cannabis so I mean there's four

4171
02:51:47,040 --> 02:51:51,439
universities here people so if you

4172
02:51:49,120 --> 02:51:53,560
contact San Jose State University they

4173
02:51:51,439 --> 02:51:56,079
have over a thousand students that

4174
02:51:53,559 --> 02:51:58,398
actually have that are in the market

4175
02:51:56,079 --> 02:52:01,559
right now they can find your properly

4176
02:51:58,398 --> 02:52:03,719
biodegradable or secondary use uh un

4177
02:52:01,559 --> 02:52:05,959
recycled products it's just it's going

4178
02:52:03,719 --> 02:52:08,199
to cost more thenan that's the reality

4179
02:52:05,959 --> 02:52:11,639
but the consumer has shown that they

4180
02:52:08,200 --> 02:52:14,479
will pay more if they know a product is

4181
02:52:11,639 --> 02:52:16,519
quality and sound and even packaged in

4182
02:52:14,478 --> 02:52:19,438
quality so there needs to be an

4183
02:52:16,520 --> 02:52:21,880
education so that more manufacturers and

4184
02:52:19,439 --> 02:52:24,200
Distributors actually make that

4185
02:52:21,879 --> 02:52:25,799
investment so that the consumers can

4186
02:52:24,200 --> 02:52:29,040
benefit from it otherwise we're left

4187
02:52:25,799 --> 02:52:32,318
with tons of trash and not including

4188
02:52:29,040 --> 02:52:33,600
cartridges well etan alsoo I appreciate

4189
02:52:32,318 --> 02:52:35,639
one of the things you just brought up

4190
02:52:33,600 --> 02:52:38,479
was that the negative Impressions on

4191
02:52:35,639 --> 02:52:40,159
nitrogen packed cannabis in the Oregon

4192
02:52:38,478 --> 02:52:43,119
early wreck Market we saw these

4193
02:52:40,159 --> 02:52:44,879
survivalist tins that had packed eights

4194
02:52:43,120 --> 02:52:46,319
and there was like some big IP deal

4195
02:52:44,879 --> 02:52:48,679
where you had to pay a lot of money to

4196
02:52:46,318 --> 02:52:50,359
use that technology but bottom line is I

4197
02:52:48,680 --> 02:52:52,520
think one of the issues that we saw was

4198
02:52:50,359 --> 02:52:54,800
people simply weren't measuring moisture

4199
02:52:52,520 --> 02:52:57,760
with like a moisture analyzer or getting

4200
02:52:54,799 --> 02:52:59,478
consistently correct 10% and if they

4201
02:52:57,760 --> 02:53:02,200
were packing just a little bit over

4202
02:52:59,478 --> 02:53:03,719
moist then you we seal it you or unseal

4203
02:53:02,200 --> 02:53:05,880
it you get this moment of you've got the

4204
02:53:03,719 --> 02:53:08,000
nose but then the product is crap and we

4205
02:53:05,879 --> 02:53:09,959
saw a lot of bad brand Impressions

4206
02:53:08,000 --> 02:53:12,760
exactly but now that we're getting the

4207
02:53:09,959 --> 02:53:15,159
moisture really on point and packing in

4208
02:53:12,760 --> 02:53:17,600
that way I am seeing absolutely benefit

4209
02:53:15,159 --> 02:53:19,000
from suppressing that oxidative Force

4210
02:53:17,600 --> 02:53:20,318
there's one other quick trial I just

4211
02:53:19,000 --> 02:53:22,478
wanted to mention that's happening right

4212
02:53:20,318 --> 02:53:24,680
now that I think is fascinating Ethan

4213
02:53:22,478 --> 02:53:27,959
has been coming down to proof and we're

4214
02:53:24,680 --> 02:53:29,720
doing this trial on a sort of folk cryo

4215
02:53:27,959 --> 02:53:31,879
it's very much this is a little bit of

4216
02:53:29,719 --> 02:53:33,959
an aside but I think very related it's

4217
02:53:31,879 --> 02:53:35,959
all about preserving these attributes

4218
02:53:33,959 --> 02:53:37,278
that we see at the production then

4219
02:53:35,959 --> 02:53:39,879
hopefully getting it all the way to the

4220
02:53:37,279 --> 02:53:42,319
end point uh essentially he's made a

4221
02:53:39,879 --> 02:53:44,278
freezer that is a chest freezer or

4222
02:53:42,318 --> 02:53:47,039
excuse me it's like a cooler that we

4223
02:53:44,279 --> 02:53:49,040
have dry ice on the bottom a metal

4224
02:53:47,040 --> 02:53:51,439
vessel we put the flower on on top of

4225
02:53:49,040 --> 02:53:54,200
that's conductive and then a metal tray

4226
02:53:51,439 --> 02:53:56,720
on top with dry ice above it then the

4227
02:53:54,200 --> 02:53:59,479
cooler has a spigot and the spigot is

4228
02:53:56,719 --> 02:54:01,879
left open and it creates a convection

4229
02:53:59,478 --> 02:54:05,000
and it is like a very cheap way to get

4230
02:54:01,879 --> 02:54:07,559
to a lyophilization like process we took

4231
02:54:05,000 --> 02:54:10,079
fresh harvested plants we immediately

4232
02:54:07,559 --> 02:54:13,000
put the fresh harvested plants in the

4233
02:54:10,079 --> 02:54:15,639
cryo chamber then we did a very brief

4234
02:54:13,000 --> 02:54:18,439
dry of the fresh material then put that

4235
02:54:15,639 --> 02:54:21,358
into a mechanical separator we have lab

4236
02:54:18,439 --> 02:54:24,720
results from light scale Labs uh for the

4237
02:54:21,359 --> 02:54:27,479
flower before it was keed the flower uh

4238
02:54:24,719 --> 02:54:29,278
after it was keed and the KE we did that

4239
02:54:27,478 --> 02:54:32,039
process and now we're contrasting it in

4240
02:54:29,279 --> 02:54:34,479
the second wave with my my typical like

4241
02:54:32,040 --> 02:54:36,600
technical drying process and we're doing

4242
02:54:34,478 --> 02:54:39,278
the exact same sort of three points of

4243
02:54:36,600 --> 02:54:41,120
data the first thing that we saw was a

4244
02:54:39,279 --> 02:54:43,079
low yield of course because we actually

4245
02:54:41,120 --> 02:54:44,960
did it too short of a dry and didn't

4246
02:54:43,079 --> 02:54:47,959
have a very hashy plant and there was a

4247
02:54:44,959 --> 02:54:48,879
few variables there but what we saw was

4248
02:54:47,959 --> 02:54:52,278
remark

4249
02:54:48,879 --> 02:54:56,079
the exact tpes that were in the flower

4250
02:54:52,279 --> 02:54:57,840
at the same ratios were in the cryoe and

4251
02:54:56,079 --> 02:55:00,318
even when I'm running normal Keith

4252
02:54:57,840 --> 02:55:02,200
process I do not see that I see

4253
02:55:00,318 --> 02:55:04,680
variation uh whether we're seeing

4254
02:55:02,200 --> 02:55:06,359
degradation of monot Turpin or other

4255
02:55:04,680 --> 02:55:08,600
elements that just seem to have moved

4256
02:55:06,359 --> 02:55:11,000
around we were able with a freshly

4257
02:55:08,600 --> 02:55:13,200
harvested plant to really really secure

4258
02:55:11,000 --> 02:55:16,000
that and I do think hash is one of the

4259
02:55:13,200 --> 02:55:17,920
ANS like the most ancient answer to that

4260
02:55:16,000 --> 02:55:19,879
preservation of this product that

4261
02:55:17,920 --> 02:55:22,159
creates a shelf stability with this like

4262
02:55:19,879 --> 02:55:23,959
incredible rind and there's this wisdom

4263
02:55:22,159 --> 02:55:26,119
in that process that I still feel is

4264
02:55:23,959 --> 02:55:28,839
very underrepresented in this freshness

4265
02:55:26,120 --> 02:55:30,840
conversation but I really love flower

4266
02:55:28,840 --> 02:55:33,398
and I want people to see the flower as

4267
02:55:30,840 --> 02:55:35,600
we do these unbelievable passionate

4268
02:55:33,398 --> 02:55:38,238
massive expressions and I think we have

4269
02:55:35,600 --> 02:55:38,238
some ways to

4270
02:55:38,398 --> 02:55:43,799
go yeah well if you think back you know

4271
02:55:41,478 --> 02:55:46,000
10 15 years ago when you walked into a a

4272
02:55:43,799 --> 02:55:48,759
health food store all the essential

4273
02:55:46,000 --> 02:55:50,639
fatty acids and the

4274
02:55:48,760 --> 02:55:51,439
probiotics were still just sitting on

4275
02:55:50,639 --> 02:55:54,478
the

4276
02:55:51,439 --> 02:55:56,398
shelf and you know like my my old Co-op

4277
02:55:54,478 --> 02:55:57,760
they didn't keep it so cold in there you

4278
02:55:56,398 --> 02:56:00,238
know because they were running on a

4279
02:55:57,760 --> 02:56:02,238
budget it wasn't like going to Vans but

4280
02:56:00,238 --> 02:56:03,680
then over time we all started to demand

4281
02:56:02,238 --> 02:56:05,439
that you know our probiotics and

4282
02:56:03,680 --> 02:56:08,000
essential fatty acids needed to be

4283
02:56:05,439 --> 02:56:09,680
refrigerated and if and then you saw for

4284
02:56:08,000 --> 02:56:11,879
a while they had some of them still on

4285
02:56:09,680 --> 02:56:13,960
the shelf and then some manufacturers

4286
02:56:11,879 --> 02:56:16,398
who were really adamant that this

4287
02:56:13,959 --> 02:56:19,278
product has to stay in the coal chain

4288
02:56:16,398 --> 02:56:22,119
all the way through manufact in shipping

4289
02:56:19,279 --> 02:56:24,319
and then eventually retail and then we

4290
02:56:22,120 --> 02:56:26,120
you know as consumers we started we got

4291
02:56:24,318 --> 02:56:28,159
more educated and then we only bought

4292
02:56:26,120 --> 02:56:30,520
the probiotics that were in the

4293
02:56:28,159 --> 02:56:31,959
refrigerated section you know and

4294
02:56:30,520 --> 02:56:34,040
obviously to there's some that are more

4295
02:56:31,959 --> 02:56:36,519
shelf stable and some that are more you

4296
02:56:34,040 --> 02:56:38,800
know dependent on temperature and all

4297
02:56:36,520 --> 02:56:40,560
that so yeah it's really about the the

4298
02:56:38,799 --> 02:56:43,759
cold chain you know I was talking to a

4299
02:56:40,559 --> 02:56:45,559
cultivator the other day um about some

4300
02:56:43,760 --> 02:56:47,000
products that they had me sample and you

4301
02:56:45,559 --> 02:56:49,039
know I was trying to be polite and just

4302
02:56:47,000 --> 02:56:50,398
the turps were a little low and I was

4303
02:56:49,040 --> 02:56:52,000
asking him about why his trips were a

4304
02:56:50,398 --> 02:56:54,680
little low and I looked at the COA and

4305
02:56:52,000 --> 02:56:56,719
the water activity level was very low

4306
02:56:54,680 --> 02:56:58,960
and he said straight out he said look I

4307
02:56:56,719 --> 02:57:01,920
can't control what happens when when

4308
02:56:58,959 --> 02:57:04,719
this flower leaves my farm and we've had

4309
02:57:01,920 --> 02:57:06,920
big issues with mold and sometimes it

4310
02:57:04,719 --> 02:57:09,438
sits through the manufacturer I mean in

4311
02:57:06,920 --> 02:57:11,040
the distribution then it sits at the lab

4312
02:57:09,439 --> 02:57:14,159
by the time it's tested we don't really

4313
02:57:11,040 --> 02:57:15,960
know what they're testing so to mitigate

4314
02:57:14,159 --> 02:57:19,439
that they they bring the water activity

4315
02:57:15,959 --> 02:57:21,519
low below 50% which is you know at

4316
02:57:19,439 --> 02:57:24,439
serious risk for turpine loss obviously

4317
02:57:21,520 --> 02:57:26,159
depending on your your your profile but

4318
02:57:24,439 --> 02:57:27,639
that's their fear they're just like look

4319
02:57:26,159 --> 02:57:31,439
like you said Jeremy the biggest one of

4320
02:57:27,639 --> 02:57:34,719
the biggest losses for for um Farmers is

4321
02:57:31,439 --> 02:57:36,880
is failure on testing so I was also

4322
02:57:34,719 --> 02:57:39,159
wondering you know it's anyone heard

4323
02:57:36,879 --> 02:57:40,839
anyone using oxygen absorbers in their

4324
02:57:39,159 --> 02:57:42,760
packaging I never see oxygen absorbers

4325
02:57:40,840 --> 02:57:45,639
in cannabis nearly as much as I do in

4326
02:57:42,760 --> 02:57:47,800
other food products I am move I've I've

4327
02:57:45,639 --> 02:57:48,799
been deploying these food grade oxygen

4328
02:57:47,799 --> 02:57:50,559
absor

4329
02:57:48,799 --> 02:57:52,559
there's an issue where if you have too

4330
02:57:50,559 --> 02:57:54,318
much of course they get hot they're

4331
02:57:52,559 --> 02:57:56,318
creating heat in a small environment

4332
02:57:54,318 --> 02:57:58,799
it's a nominal amount of heat I'm not

4333
02:57:56,318 --> 02:58:01,559
overly concerned but that's the primary

4334
02:57:58,799 --> 02:58:03,159
consideration I typically I my ideal

4335
02:58:01,559 --> 02:58:06,959
process was the rigid lightproof

4336
02:58:03,159 --> 02:58:08,959
container airtite um packed by hand then

4337
02:58:06,959 --> 02:58:11,199
filled topped off with gas not a

4338
02:58:08,959 --> 02:58:13,919
scientific process for nitrogen sealing

4339
02:58:11,200 --> 02:58:17,040
just simply literally uh running the the

4340
02:58:13,920 --> 02:58:21,318
gas for a count and then uh packing with

4341
02:58:17,040 --> 02:58:22,840
about two oxygen absorbers per 228 grams

4342
02:58:21,318 --> 02:58:25,760
that's been essentially where I've seen

4343
02:58:22,840 --> 02:58:27,840
the best uh sort of shelf stability of

4344
02:58:25,760 --> 02:58:29,478
some of the more nuanced profiles one

4345
02:58:27,840 --> 02:58:31,238
tiny thing moav you missed this part

4346
02:58:29,478 --> 02:58:33,199
about terpinolene there was this whole

4347
02:58:31,238 --> 02:58:35,359
riff in the beginning that was so like

4348
02:58:33,200 --> 02:58:37,239
part of your soul and one of the things

4349
02:58:35,359 --> 02:58:39,600
I think about that's fascinating in My

4350
02:58:37,238 --> 02:58:41,760
Vault when I have astral Works which is

4351
02:58:39,600 --> 02:58:43,520
a terpinolene dominant type two it's

4352
02:58:41,760 --> 02:58:44,800
been there like we couldn't sell it when

4353
02:58:43,520 --> 02:58:48,680
we were first growing it because people

4354
02:58:44,799 --> 02:58:51,679
would not buy a 6% THC profile but it

4355
02:58:48,680 --> 02:58:54,200
lasted in the vault for two years two

4356
02:58:51,680 --> 02:58:57,439
years later it's still the terpinolene

4357
02:58:54,200 --> 02:58:59,920
was so remarkably stable it was a bright

4358
02:58:57,439 --> 02:59:01,760
foral intense note that I mean it was in

4359
02:58:59,920 --> 02:59:04,079
a temperature controlled situation like

4360
02:59:01,760 --> 02:59:07,159
that but there's no other product I have

4361
02:59:04,079 --> 02:59:09,120
that had that longevity or rather any

4362
02:59:07,159 --> 02:59:10,639
other profile that I've seen that has

4363
02:59:09,120 --> 02:59:13,239
had that kind of longevity it's a

4364
02:59:10,639 --> 02:59:15,959
fascinating thing that it's so I I wish

4365
02:59:13,238 --> 02:59:17,478
Dr uh Lewis had not I left because I am

4366
02:59:15,959 --> 02:59:19,478
fascinated about that stability and I

4367
02:59:17,478 --> 02:59:22,799
don't know if even uh Mark might have

4368
02:59:19,478 --> 02:59:26,238
information yeah so so so maybe it's a

4369
02:59:22,799 --> 02:59:29,719
sacrificial scavenger like maybe it it

4370
02:59:26,238 --> 02:59:33,000
scavenges oxygen with time and so if

4371
02:59:29,719 --> 02:59:35,879
there is any uh infiltration of oxygen

4372
02:59:33,000 --> 02:59:38,398
into the packaging the high terpinolene

4373
02:59:35,879 --> 02:59:41,278
content would react with that remember

4374
02:59:38,398 --> 02:59:43,959
that I yeah what we were saying earlier

4375
02:59:41,279 --> 02:59:46,279
Jeremy and I don't know if uh Mark kind

4376
02:59:43,959 --> 02:59:51,278
of picked up on the question which was

4377
02:59:46,279 --> 02:59:54,279
that um terpinolene if it oxidizes makes

4378
02:59:51,279 --> 02:59:56,840
terpenol and and depending on where

4379
02:59:54,279 --> 02:59:59,920
those double bonds are in the molecule

4380
02:59:56,840 --> 03:00:02,318
because these are all isomers of of

4381
02:59:59,920 --> 03:00:05,040
lyine right and and and so when these

4382
03:00:02,318 --> 03:00:06,000
are made in the plant you're kind of in

4383
03:00:05,040 --> 03:00:08,920
some

4384
03:00:06,000 --> 03:00:11,040
thermodynamic well which is that okay

4385
03:00:08,920 --> 03:00:14,600
you get a little bit of limine you get a

4386
03:00:11,040 --> 03:00:18,600
little bit of terpinolene but I I think

4387
03:00:14,600 --> 03:00:20,760
terpinolene oxidizes on curing to

4388
03:00:18,600 --> 03:00:22,880
penol and you know again I don't have

4389
03:00:20,760 --> 03:00:25,120
any data to support that but you you

4390
03:00:22,879 --> 03:00:28,278
just look at the structure and you say

4391
03:00:25,120 --> 03:00:31,120
Well it wants to be an aromatic ring now

4392
03:00:28,279 --> 03:00:33,359
Pine is the completely aromatic ring

4393
03:00:31,120 --> 03:00:35,479
with a methyl group on one side and an

4394
03:00:33,359 --> 03:00:38,040
isopropyl group on the other but when

4395
03:00:35,478 --> 03:00:40,559
you have two double bonds like you do in

4396
03:00:38,040 --> 03:00:42,960
terpinolene that wants to do chemistry

4397
03:00:40,559 --> 03:00:45,359
and it wants to do chemistry with oxygen

4398
03:00:42,959 --> 03:00:48,599
and if it does chemistry with oxygen I

4399
03:00:45,359 --> 03:00:51,318
think it makes turpine null so it'd be

4400
03:00:48,600 --> 03:00:53,559
interesting to look in that sample and

4401
03:00:51,318 --> 03:00:56,238
see if you see a little bit of TP your

4402
03:00:53,559 --> 03:00:58,119
tpol Spike going up I want to measure

4403
03:00:56,238 --> 03:01:00,398
that I will do exactly as you've said

4404
03:00:58,120 --> 03:01:03,000
one question is I've never smelled a

4405
03:01:00,398 --> 03:01:05,680
standard of terpenol only

4406
03:01:03,000 --> 03:01:07,680
terpinolene isolated have you smelled

4407
03:01:05,680 --> 03:01:10,680
that and would you describe them as

4408
03:01:07,680 --> 03:01:13,639
relatively pretty tight or one's a

4409
03:01:10,680 --> 03:01:17,279
little more kind of like I guess I would

4410
03:01:13,639 --> 03:01:19,159
call it less fuy and more nutty I I

4411
03:01:17,279 --> 03:01:22,920
nutty isn't isn't the right word it's

4412
03:01:19,159 --> 03:01:25,879
just it's got kind of like a a cinnamon

4413
03:01:22,920 --> 03:01:28,520
more like a Caraway but less like a

4414
03:01:25,879 --> 03:01:30,559
cinnamon but I spicy wouldn't you

4415
03:01:28,520 --> 03:01:32,359
wouldn't you say I I have some

4416
03:01:30,559 --> 03:01:36,478
degraded

4417
03:01:32,359 --> 03:01:39,399
funny this is it gets

4418
03:01:36,478 --> 03:01:40,920
rounder spicy and round yeah this is

4419
03:01:39,398 --> 03:01:43,039
exactly what we were trying to talk

4420
03:01:40,920 --> 03:01:46,000
about in the room the other day in

4421
03:01:43,040 --> 03:01:49,479
clubhouse and we just we diverted to

4422
03:01:46,000 --> 03:01:51,120
well tpin are aign unto themselves you

4423
03:01:49,478 --> 03:01:53,079
can't put words let me grab some

4424
03:01:51,120 --> 03:01:54,680
actually I have some degraded turpion

4425
03:01:53,079 --> 03:01:57,359
let me I'll be right back so you can't

4426
03:01:54,680 --> 03:02:01,200
necessarily put a word to it so again

4427
03:01:57,359 --> 03:02:06,399
like when I think about like so so turpy

4428
03:02:01,200 --> 03:02:10,680
turpy n is less gassy more nutty uh

4429
03:02:06,398 --> 03:02:13,199
terpinolene to me anyway smells gassy

4430
03:02:10,680 --> 03:02:15,359
smells like and and I can't really smell

4431
03:02:13,200 --> 03:02:18,120
the difference between it and some of

4432
03:02:15,359 --> 03:02:21,238
the other monot Turpin certainly lyine

4433
03:02:18,120 --> 03:02:24,840
smells completely different but limine

4434
03:02:21,238 --> 03:02:27,398
is is very shallow Citrus where venine

4435
03:02:24,840 --> 03:02:29,398
that other um cesa turpine we were

4436
03:02:27,398 --> 03:02:32,559
talking about the other day has a much

4437
03:02:29,398 --> 03:02:36,358
more Fuller bodied orange kind of you

4438
03:02:32,559 --> 03:02:38,079
know bottom note to it um one's the

4439
03:02:36,359 --> 03:02:41,040
Contra bassoon and the other's the

4440
03:02:38,079 --> 03:02:41,840
piccolo flute you know what I mean in

4441
03:02:41,040 --> 03:02:45,120
the

4442
03:02:41,840 --> 03:02:47,359
orchestra so they just have different

4443
03:02:45,120 --> 03:02:49,359
frequencies as well as the different

4444
03:02:47,359 --> 03:02:51,520
volume and I think what was really

4445
03:02:49,359 --> 03:02:55,359
interesting in in those graphs that Mark

4446
03:02:51,520 --> 03:02:58,000
was showing earlier is that one osam

4447
03:02:55,359 --> 03:03:00,359
dominant thing you know osine is very is

4448
03:02:58,000 --> 03:03:02,920
like it's kind of like merine it's very

4449
03:03:00,359 --> 03:03:05,720
fleeting it it's going to evaporate and

4450
03:03:02,920 --> 03:03:09,359
depending on again how well that stuff

4451
03:03:05,719 --> 03:03:11,879
is cured how well the the uh the the

4452
03:03:09,359 --> 03:03:15,800
butt is grown to begin with you might

4453
03:03:11,879 --> 03:03:18,559
see that Peak go go up and down quite a

4454
03:03:15,799 --> 03:03:21,478
bit so mark it really

4455
03:03:18,559 --> 03:03:22,879
it's quite it has this like mint this is

4456
03:03:21,478 --> 03:03:25,599
from Jack

4457
03:03:22,879 --> 03:03:28,358
herrer this is very it has a mint kind

4458
03:03:25,600 --> 03:03:30,520
of vibe to it and it's very round like

4459
03:03:28,359 --> 03:03:34,040
it just has this like

4460
03:03:30,520 --> 03:03:38,720
soft mint and then you can kind of like

4461
03:03:34,040 --> 03:03:41,439
just kind of barely smell the the Jackie

4462
03:03:38,719 --> 03:03:44,000
trinoline uh sharpness in there on the

4463
03:03:41,439 --> 03:03:47,359
very touch end of it really back end of

4464
03:03:44,000 --> 03:03:48,799
it though yeah not nearly as bright as

4465
03:03:47,359 --> 03:03:50,600
as

4466
03:03:48,799 --> 03:03:53,599
it's really odd I mean

4467
03:03:50,600 --> 03:03:55,760
it's yeah but it's so you're smelling

4468
03:03:53,600 --> 03:03:58,318
cannabis derived tpin not the pure ones

4469
03:03:55,760 --> 03:04:00,040
right yeah just cannabis drive so

4470
03:03:58,318 --> 03:04:02,478
there's more going on here right but

4471
03:04:00,040 --> 03:04:04,800
it's a dominant right it's a whole

4472
03:04:02,478 --> 03:04:07,119
different b as soon as you combine them

4473
03:04:04,799 --> 03:04:09,879
with other right it's a whole different

4474
03:04:07,120 --> 03:04:11,880
thing right right still beautiful it's

4475
03:04:09,879 --> 03:04:14,039
so it's so like no I'm not saying it's

4476
03:04:11,879 --> 03:04:16,438
not beautiful I bet you it's much better

4477
03:04:14,040 --> 03:04:19,439
than smelling the monot Turpin but the

4478
03:04:16,439 --> 03:04:21,398
monot Turpin are overpowering and they

4479
03:04:19,439 --> 03:04:25,238
don't really have the full

4480
03:04:21,398 --> 03:04:28,519
bodess that that a cannabis profile of

4481
03:04:25,238 --> 03:04:32,478
tpin would have so Mark I was I was

4482
03:04:28,520 --> 03:04:35,720
looking at beta aamine and Alpha aamine

4483
03:04:32,478 --> 03:04:38,278
do do you know the distinct differences

4484
03:04:35,719 --> 03:04:39,639
between the effects of those two um

4485
03:04:38,279 --> 03:04:41,680
because I really haven't really found

4486
03:04:39,639 --> 03:04:43,879
any

4487
03:04:41,680 --> 03:04:46,120
definitive no and I think what's even

4488
03:04:43,879 --> 03:04:48,839
crazy with anything definitive about it

4489
03:04:46,120 --> 03:04:51,399
I I I don't know this for but aren't

4490
03:04:48,840 --> 03:04:54,000
those two forms of osine

4491
03:04:51,398 --> 03:04:55,680
interconvertible yes they are yeah so

4492
03:04:54,000 --> 03:04:58,398
it's like one's a cyst and the other

4493
03:04:55,680 --> 03:05:00,479
one's a trans double bond and if you

4494
03:04:58,398 --> 03:05:04,398
stare at them crossey they kind of

4495
03:05:00,478 --> 03:05:06,840
interconvert so yeah Mother Nature you

4496
03:05:04,398 --> 03:05:09,358
know playing with their Tinker Toys yeah

4497
03:05:06,840 --> 03:05:12,120
I mean you could really you know move

4498
03:05:09,359 --> 03:05:14,840
the atoms around and make different

4499
03:05:12,120 --> 03:05:18,000
molecules and it's just it's so crazy

4500
03:05:14,840 --> 03:05:21,719
again how sophisticated are old faction

4501
03:05:18,000 --> 03:05:25,840
response is in being able to detect

4502
03:05:21,719 --> 03:05:28,199
slight differences in say you know those

4503
03:05:25,840 --> 03:05:31,279
those molecules in these in these

4504
03:05:28,200 --> 03:05:33,920
fragrant mixtures Mother Nature playing

4505
03:05:31,279 --> 03:05:37,279
with her Tinker Toys that is the best

4506
03:05:33,920 --> 03:05:41,200
thing I got out of this whole thing

4507
03:05:37,279 --> 03:05:44,238
today it's about time I did something

4508
03:05:41,200 --> 03:05:46,720
useful no I I think the discussion with

4509
03:05:44,238 --> 03:05:48,680
Mark was just great Marcus so thank you

4510

4514
03:05:57,079 --> 03:06:00,920
just

4515
03:05:58,359 --> 03:06:03,238
we're it's just off the hook right I

4516
03:06:00,920 --> 03:06:06,040
mean we get a certain critical mass of

4517
03:06:03,238 --> 03:06:08,039
people in a room and before you know it

4518
03:06:06,040 --> 03:06:09,840
it's just like yeah a bunch of stone

4519
03:06:08,040 --> 03:06:12,960
people talking about our favorite

4520
03:06:09,840 --> 03:06:14,960
subject how long could that go on right

4521
03:06:12,959 --> 03:06:17,000
our spouses don't like it at all they

4522
03:06:14,959 --> 03:06:19,159

03:06:17,000 --> 03:06:21,159
every night

4524
03:06:19,159 --> 03:06:24,119
yeah exactly true

4525
03:06:21,159 --> 03:06:27,000
story no where it's like uh it's like

4526

4564
03:08:06,760 --> 03:08:12,398
the moment yeah Peter thanks for sharing

4567
03:08:15,799 --> 03:08:20,719

03:08:23,159 --> 03:08:27,959
hash Church um Facebook page or

4571
03:08:26,120 --> 03:08:30,520
something I think I could share a PDF

4572
03:08:27,959 --> 03:08:33,159
there totally man that'd be an honor

4573

4574
03:08:33,159 --> 03:08:39,279
awesome yeah it looks really cool I mean

4575
03:08:35,959 --> 03:08:41,119
I I think as more studies like this come

4576
03:08:39,279 --> 03:08:44,760
out I think they're really going to see

4577
03:08:41,120 --> 03:08:47,160
the power to regenerative growing right

4578
03:08:44,760 --> 03:08:48,279
I mean when it actually makes a yield

4579
03:08:47,159 --> 03:08:50,279
imp

4580
03:08:48,279 --> 03:08:52,840
and people can understand the economic

4581
03:08:50,279 --> 03:08:56,319
impact that it has that I have this

4582
03:08:52,840 --> 03:08:58,840
field producing this and this field only

4583
03:08:56,318 --> 03:09:02,238
producing this what's the

4584
03:08:58,840 --> 03:09:05,200
difference yeah yeah so it's it's real

03:09:55,439 --> 03:10:00,159
into a country's legal cannabis Market

4606

4628
03:10:54,478 --> 03:10:59,438
supply chain isn't really addressing all

4629

Marcus and hey everybody go easy on the

4679
03:13:15,760 --> 03:13:20,760
man just because this decides to do

4680
03:13:17,680 --> 03:13:22,520
Clubhouse because it's easier to access

4681
03:13:20,760 --> 03:13:25,639
Etc doesn't mean you have to give them a

4682
03:13:22,520 --> 03:13:28,319
whole bunch of Guff you know uh we we do

4683

this out of love this is all volunteer

4684
03:13:28,318 --> 03:13:32,760
so you know we just do it because we

4685
03:13:30,318 --> 03:13:35,920
want to share the knowledge as well but

4686
03:13:32,760 --> 03:13:38,439
you know don't get all up in Marcus's

4687
03:13:35,920 --> 03:13:41,000
Grill just because he's unable to do a

4688
03:13:38,439 --> 03:13:42,680
hash Church you know uh go easy there

4689
03:13:41,000 --> 03:13:44,600
kids that's all I'm saying we do what we

4690
03:13:42,680 --> 03:13:46,600
can when we can and we appreciate when

4691
03:13:44,600 --> 03:13:48,600
we're here but we can't do this every

4692
03:13:46,600 --> 03:13:51,279
single day you know that's the reality

4693
03:13:48,600 --> 03:13:53,760
but sometimes we can on clubhouse so you

4694
03:13:51,279 --> 03:13:55,279
know go easy yeah join Clubhouse if you

4695
03:13:53,760 --> 03:13:57,079
guys want to get in on on the

4696
03:13:55,279 --> 03:14:00,840
conversation it's always open to

4697
03:13:57,079 --> 03:14:02,559
everyone it's here because of each other

4698
03:14:00,840 --> 03:14:04,238
yeah it seems CL house is actually not

4699
03:14:02,559 --> 03:14:06,039
open to everyone it's only open to

4700
03:14:04,238 --> 03:14:07,639
iPhone users that was the point of

4701
03:14:06,040 --> 03:14:10,120
contention but I do appreciate you

4702
03:14:07,639 --> 03:14:12,358
mentioning that atan because uh yeah we

4703
03:14:10,120 --> 03:14:15,000
took a little bit of gruff

4704
03:14:12,359 --> 03:14:17,680
there yeah and you can also do it on the

4705
03:14:15,000 --> 03:14:20,439
iPad too but hopefully they'll expand

4706
03:14:17,680 --> 03:14:22,840
onto you know other platforms because

4707
03:14:20,439 --> 03:14:25,318
it's expanding quickly and largely you

4708
03:14:22,840 --> 03:14:28,200
know because it's an accessible platform

4709
03:14:25,318 --> 03:14:30,680
for everybody and it's uh it's mobile

4710
03:14:28,200 --> 03:14:33,159
and we can you know jump on whenever as

4711
03:14:30,680 --> 03:14:34,520
well as jump off whenever whereas we got

4712
03:14:33,159 --> 03:14:37,600
a specific time and date that we're

4713
03:14:34,520 --> 03:14:39,560
trying to the so you know uh if you get

4714
03:14:37,600 --> 03:14:41,079
the opportunity people try Clubhouse

4715
03:14:39,559 --> 03:14:43,559
it's worth a shot you know if you're on

4716
03:14:41,079 --> 03:14:45,398
able to be patient it's coming soon and
