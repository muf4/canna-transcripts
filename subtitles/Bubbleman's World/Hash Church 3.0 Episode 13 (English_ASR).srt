get our crew because for whatever reason

16
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:46,359
the way Zoom works now is it doesn't let

17
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:48,719
me go live from the actual video that

18
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:50,519

19
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,879
used to do that but now it starts a

20
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,359
whole new link so there's 80 people in

21
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:57,039

22
00:00:54,359 --> 00:01:00,039

it yes yes of course of course I felt

47
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,920
bad last week we didn't talk about the

48
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:58,519
hash Church uh we did have a great hash

49
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,439
Church episode though and I think that

50
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:02,599
was the problem there was just so much

51
00:02:00,438 --> 00:02:04,199
to talk about and it was pulling us into

52
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:07,078
the mushroom and once the mushroom gets

53
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,598
a hold of you well you know that's uh

54
00:02:07,078 --> 00:02:11,399
that's usually five or six hours before

55
00:02:08,598 --> 00:02:11,399
it lets go

56
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:16,439
so but we got you back today um I'm not

57
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,160
sure who's gon to come in today it might

58
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:22,400
be kind of a small hash Church it might

59
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:24,199
be a big hash Church um last week I sent

60
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,200
the link through Facebook but some of

61
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:28,318
the people in that link didn't receive

62
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:30,679
it Dr Mark shalone said he didn't

63
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:32,679
receive the link uh which I haven't

64
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:35,000
figured out how that is because there's

65
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,599
two groups I send out emails to certain

66
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,318
groups Wade for instance is on the

67
00:02:36,598 --> 00:02:42,199
emails and then I do Facebook Messenger

68
00:02:39,318 --> 00:02:43,839
invites as well uh of which most of the

69
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:49,000
rest of you guys uh probably would have

70
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:53,360
gotten your link that way welcome Johnny

71
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,759
B maybe Johnny B can't hear yet welcome

72
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,080
Johnny

73
00:02:54,759 --> 00:03:01,199

81
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:25,439
guys this morning I think uh like I said

82
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:27,639
I kind of put it together last minute I

83
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:30,039
would prefer to just do any old hash

84
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:31,518
church just to keep it consistent that's

85
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:33,158
what kind of everyone's looking for

86
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,799
right now in these crazy times that

87
00:03:33,158 --> 00:03:37,120
we're living in um and I just figured

88
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:39,159
you know what even if we got together

89
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,799
for a couple hours and shot the [ __ ]

90
00:03:39,158 --> 00:03:42,719
puffed some bowls and talked a little

91
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,438
bit about the hash church cultivar and

92
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:47,400
some other things uh I figured we'd be

93
00:03:45,438 --> 00:03:51,639
good yeah Johnny's trying to configure

94
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:55,438
his audio by looking at his shelf he's

95
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:57,878
just like what the [ __ ] is going on what

96
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:57,878
the

97
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:02,439
[ __ ] he'll figure it out

98
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,400
it's usually a setting in your Zoom

99
00:04:02,438 --> 00:04:07,280
though you have to sometimes it

100
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,360
automatically uh switches your audio to

101
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,719
your mic if you have an external mic so

102
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,720
you have to switch it to your internal

103
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:17,160
audio I just switched it to my Yeti so

104

while ago he first hit me up with that

155
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:36,478
infamous picture which I wish I kind of

church thing so there you go that is

166
00:06:55,918 --> 00:07:01,198
what started it all now so so plant

167
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,800
plant porn you got some plant porn and

168
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,319
that started all up some some plant porn

169
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,598
right and you know lots of people were

170
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:09,879
like oh you know is that the hooked

171
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:11,878
triome cultivar I don't see you know

172
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:15,039
there's I don't see the heads as clearly

173
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:16,599
as I should is it you know so you know

174
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:20,000
Mark hit me up and he said listen I've

175
00:07:16,598 --> 00:07:21,399
got this cultivar I want to name it hash

176
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,160
church and I was kind of like a little

177
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:25,959
bit like oo I was a little bit like I'm

178
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,080
kind of a little bit protective of like

179
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:30,399
the hash Church name you know I haven't

180
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:32,279
monetized it I haven't done anything

181
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:33,959
like that and I told him like I'm not

182
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:35,758
going to I don't want to be up I don't

183
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:38,399
want to take anything from you I'm not

184
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:40,280
trying to be that greasy guy that just

185
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:42,279
starts monetizing everything that I'm

186
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:43,638
doing with you guys I just didn't really

187
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:46,758
you know feel that it was the thing I

188
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:49,918
wanted to do but he he said look let me

189
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:52,240
let me send you a cut you can grow it

190
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:54,279
you can Harvest it you can let me know

191
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,079
if you think it's it's it's it could

192
00:07:54,279 --> 00:08:00,679
hold the name hash church and so he sent

193
00:07:57,079 --> 00:08:03,279
me the cut and I managed to get one to

194
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:05,879
Flav and I completely [ __ ] uh the rest

195
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:07,158
of it up and uh I just for whatever

196
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:08,800
reason it was one of the first plants

197
00:08:07,158 --> 00:08:10,478
and I don't think this has anything to

198
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,720
do with the plant itself cuz Flav is

199
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:14,399
crushing it but generally whenever I've

200
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,280
had a small tent I've been able to throw

201
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:18,359
a couple of plants in there and never

202
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:19,878
have a problem with this one it just

203
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,520
gave me a problem for whatever reason

204
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:24,800
and and funny enough I ended up putting

205
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:26,158
a Congo just to sort of save face as to

206
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,800
you know realize that I'm not talking

207
00:08:26,158 --> 00:08:30,240
[ __ ] on the hash church I threw a Congo

208
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,759
into the same tent and the exact same

209
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,918
thing started happening it just started

210
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:37,000
looking like it was nutrient deficient

211
00:08:34,918 --> 00:08:38,918
like it was locking like and I mean like

212
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,679
I know how to grow weed I feed very

213
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:43,958
simple Med I'm using medy one of course

214
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:47,159
no what light I'm listen I'm not gonna

215
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:49,319
get into a huge alian LED conversation

216
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:51,480
with you right now but it is I had an

217
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,959
LED light in from one of the companies

218
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:55,480
and I had an HPS in there as well the

219
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:57,119
old tried and true which I've always

220
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,959
been able to grow great resin with full

221
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,440
melt resin anyway totally [ __ ] that up

222
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:04,559
and you know Mark being as awesome as he

223
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:06,519
is was like well maybe I could send you

224
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:08,359
some flour and you could just like make

225
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:10,879
a batch like run run some hash or

226
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:12,440
something I was like oh man like I feel

227
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:14,360
bad you know like I told him well if you

228
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:16,760
send me flour I'm not smoking any of the

229
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:18,839
hash it's all been sitting in these um

230
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:21,600
pizza boxes since I made it I actually

231
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:23,160
made it for my course on camera uh but I

232
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,200
wanted to talk about it and the hash

233
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:28,199
came out completely white I mean

234
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:30,519
complete like super light colored uh it

235
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,278
did have a melt Factor to it it wasn't

236
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:34,078
uh like a six-star but it definitely was

237
00:09:32,278 --> 00:09:37,039
melty for me what I really loved about

238
00:09:34,078 --> 00:09:39,838
it is it reminded me of an old cultivar

239
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:42,759
I used to grow back like 25 plus years

240
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,760
ago called The Dutch Treat now people

241
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:47,319
may hear that name and think they had

242
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:49,919
exactly the Dutch Treat that I have or

243
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,720
had I never really saw it as that again

244
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:53,759
and I saw the Dutch Treat many times

245
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:56,040
over the years but this particular Dutch

246
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:58,559
Treat looked very much like this it was

247
00:09:56,039 --> 00:10:01,278
very coated it had this real sort of

248
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:05,000
unique flavor which I also found this

249
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:06,919
particular cultivar had a little bit so

250
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,958
Mark why don't you tell us a little bit

251
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:11,120
about how this cult ofar came to be the

252
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:13,799
parental stock that was used to create

253
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,519
it and just a little bit about uh a

254
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:17,278
little bit about the hash church I also

255
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:20,399
want to mention before Mark starts is

256
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:23,078
that he's been you know beyond like okay

257
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:25,278
look he's he's he's like all of us like

258
00:10:23,078 --> 00:10:27,599
there we're all hurting you know this

259
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:30,639
covid-19 was is a real Crusher to him

260
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,399
and his family it took a lot away from

261
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:34,759
him and now he's in a position where

262
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,759
he's got this thing I started posting it

263
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,720
people were like where can I get that

264
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:38,278
where can I get that and they're hitting

265
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,680
him up like you wouldn't believe like we

266
00:10:38,278 --> 00:10:41,759
want to buy seeds we want to buy this we

267
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:43,479
want to buy that and he's told me he's

268
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:45,519
like listen I'm not selling it I'm not

269
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:48,039
giving it away until you give me the

270
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,679
okay that I can use this name and so I

271
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:51,439
feel a little bit bad because it's taken

272
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:53,439
a long time and if I really think of

273
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,480
what CO's taken away from this guy maybe

274
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,440
I would get off my ass a little bit more

275
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,759
and make it happen and so today that's

276
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,920
what we're doing we're talking about

277
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:03,720
hash Church on hash Church uh he's going

278
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:05,679
to let us know a little bit about the

279
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:08,720
genetics a little bit about you know

280
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:11,599
running it growing it Etc uh and then

281

started with uh years of watching hurch

292
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:43,799
to be quite honest um you know ever

293
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:47,159
since this show started I've kind of

294
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:48,799
tuned in uh I see dragonfly has just

295
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:50,719
signed out now those guys have been a

296
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:54,479
big inspiration to me I I kind of

297
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:58,040
started uh in the hydroponic type area

298
00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:00,159
back in the early 90s and then once uh

299
00:11:58,039 --> 00:12:02,799
stumbling across h church and realizing

300
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:06,240
you know Organics are definitely the the

301
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:09,599
full way um I just kind of going down

302
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:13,320
that dragonfly rout of like a fully

303
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:17,839
regenerative organic kind of uh growing

304
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:20,000
style so from that point um I just want

305
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,720
to say a big shout out to all you guys

306
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,639
every one of you Growers on here whether

307
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:27,160
you are hash makers or not uh big

308
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:29,240
inspiration for the this cultiv I don't

309
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:31,519
think and I've told this Demarcus before

310
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:34,560
I don't think the thing would exist uh

311
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:36,759
without the show or the man channel so

312
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:40,838
to give you quick rundown this fast

313
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:43,919
story of how this come to be um I was uh

314
00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:47,800
skimming across online and stumbled

315
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:50,919
across a bubble man's Channel and

316
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:53,958
um he was advertising his solventless

317
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:56,159
extraction class um so I thought what

318
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:59,000
you know to pay bit bit of respect back

319
00:12:56,159 --> 00:13:00,600
I'll will sign up for that and the thing

320
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,399
that blew me the way it was literally

321
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:06,199
like a light switch going off in my head

322
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:09,958
um he does uh his introduction a part of

323
00:13:06,198 --> 00:13:13,198
this solventless class uh hosted by ganj

324
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:15,439
University um he starts off his

325
00:13:13,198 --> 00:13:17,679
introduction in his wakeboard boat

326
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:21,279
actually uh sitting in the middle of the

327
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:23,319
ocean and dude you break down that plant

328
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:25,919
within the 20 to 30

329
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:28,480
minutes uh it was like a light switch

330
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:30,958
literally going off my head of how

331
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:34,079
little I really didn't know about the

332
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:36,039
plant and from that point I realized yes

333
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:40,120
I needed to you know I wanted to create

334
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:41,679
my own kind of hash plant so at that

335
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:45,278
point

336
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:47,399
um I I I did my first cross it didn't

337
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:49,838
turn out that great I'm just a small

338
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:54,000
little grower in in you know little 4x4

339
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:56,480
t0 so uh very very limited of what I

340
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,559
could do inside that so I figured I'm

341
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,800
going to go back at it again I I'll try

342
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:03,319
it again why not I I really wanted a

343
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:05,439
good hasher um I just didn't have access

344
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:08,839
around this area to anything any quality

345
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:11,920
like you guys talk about so uh that's

346
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:13,480
when I crossed the DNA's kosher sorbet

347
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:15,559
with uh kuu

348
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:20,839
cookies

349
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:22,479
um I collected roughly about 190 seeds

350
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:26,160
off that particular

351
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:28,920
cross and I I figured oh like I got to

352
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:31,639
give this a shot I popped the first seed

353
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:34,919
uh um as this thing was progressing into

354
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:36,680
flower I just noticed that the large

355
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:38,000
number in of Tri chromes that were

356
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:40,000
growing on it and I had enough

357
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,679
experience in the past where I realized

358
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,519
that I had uh something that I thought

359
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:48,719
was a little special as far as the tri

360
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:51,120
Chrome production went so at that point

361
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:54,040
um I just you know kept growing it out

362
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,919
taking as many photos as I could and the

363
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:59,360
cool thing was it started to produce um

364
00:14:56,919 --> 00:15:02,519
this turine like Marx had mentioned it

365
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,879
reminded me more of a a northern light

366
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:09,000
skunk cross I grew back in the 90s it

367
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:13,039
just was a super super gassy dank coming

368
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:15,839
off of it and uh my lights the photo

369
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:17,879
period would go off from s at night to 7

370
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:20,240
in the morning and I just noticed that

371
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:22,720
the the carbon filters in my indoor tent

372
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:26,680
just were not keeping up to it um that's

373
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:30,199
how gassy and stinky she was so as it

374
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:32,758
got later into flower the the the thing

375
00:15:30,198 --> 00:15:36,559
that struck me for the hash Church name

376
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:38,680
was I was taking an upshot of fan leaf

377
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:40,518
and to me it screamed like it looked

378
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:43,758
like a church window stained glass

379
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:47,159
window of a church which was super cool

380
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:51,159
so I thought [ __ ] well how cool would it

381
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:53,318
be to H you know have a a strain named

382
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:56,120
hatrid I thought the potential could be

383
00:15:53,318 --> 00:16:01,519
there um I knew I needed to make cash at

384
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:03,679
that point so I ran a B of has um and I

385
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,919
pulled the 120 I was telling Marcus the

386
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:08,559
very first run I had made of this I

387
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:10,958
pulled the 120 and it was just jammed

388
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:13,000
full jammed full I couldn't believe it

389
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:16,399
how bad this thing dumped in the

390
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,799
120 um my previous runs past that point

391
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:22,278
it just seems to have changed into a 90

392
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:24,078
and a 73 now but just a mysterious part

393
00:16:22,278 --> 00:16:27,240
of it but anyway at that point it

394
00:16:24,078 --> 00:16:29,479
reached out to uh Marcus I said hey I

395
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:31,919
think I have something that you might

396
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:34,399
want to look at I think it's got a good

397
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:36,799
potential um I'm sure he probably said

398
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,799
you know gez who's this guy why you know

399
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:41,758
why is he want me to name at

400
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:43,838
hurch um so at that point I said well

401
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:46,879
let's make you know a little bargain

402
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:49,800
deal I'll ship you some clones you guys

403
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:51,078
grow them out um at first I thought that

404
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:53,159
you know they they were going to flip

405
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:54,758
them a little bit sooner and I know Flav

406
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:58,958
had his in quarantine which was super

407
00:16:54,759 --> 00:17:01,079
cool I respect that um so I thought

408
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:03,879
yeah sorry no sorry to cut you off I

409
00:17:01,078 --> 00:17:05,279
just want to show everyone um you know

410
00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:06,679
when you're like yeah so I shipped them

411
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:09,000
off a couple of clones we talked about

412
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:10,519
this before but look what he shipped the

413
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,318
Clones off

414
00:17:10,519 --> 00:17:15,439
in this is what the Clones showed up in

415
00:17:13,318 --> 00:17:19,359
just for everyone to know this guy is

416
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:22,400
top [ __ ] Notch okay I couldn't

417
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:25,359
believe it when these custom homemade

418
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:29,000
PVC pipes that he's glued a couple of

419
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:33,359
tops onto who the [ __ ] has ever sent you

420
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:35,798
clones in a clone oh and he also added

421
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:37,839
lights he had tiny little lights

422
00:17:35,798 --> 00:17:40,440
inserted into the unit with a little

423
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:43,000
battery pack taped onto the outside so

424
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:44,880
they were they never were dark at all

425
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:49,279
the entire time that he shipped them I

426
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:51,400
have never received clones in anything

427
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:53,480
this absolutely beautiful I'll keep

428
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:56,200
these forever bro like I'm telling you

429
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:58,038
this is some tattoo art that you sent me

430
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:00,200
on the on the on the tubing that you

431
00:17:58,038 --> 00:18:02,038
sent the Clones so sorry to interrupt

432
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,798
but I needed to let everyone know the

433
00:18:02,038 --> 00:18:05,319
level of Awesomeness and the level of

434
00:18:03,798 --> 00:18:07,519
caliber that you're that you're

435
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:09,720
operating at I'm loving

436
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:10,960
that that's beautiful yeah no I

437
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:14,440
appreciate

438
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,880
that thank you appreciate that um I knew

439
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,880
yeah I definitely [ __ ] the bed the first

440
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:21,280
time was ever very first time I had

441
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:23,240
shipped clones actually and uh the very

442
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:24,558
first ones I sent to Marcus he probably

443
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:27,319
laughed when he opened them up and

444
00:18:24,558 --> 00:18:30,119
thought what the [ __ ] is this but anyway

445
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:31,918
uh he I said up you know I knew I had to

446
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:34,558
take care special care of the second

447
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:38,038
batch so I packed them up and sent them

448
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:40,798
off to them um but pretty much at that

449
00:18:38,038 --> 00:18:42,798
point uh yeah I wanted to kind of speed

450
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:44,879
the process up for Marcus at least to

451
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:47,720
get an idea of what the tpin were like

452
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,840
on this particular cultiv bar so I said

453
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:51,919
dude you know can what's chances I can

454
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:54,319
ship you some flour yeah man he says

455
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:55,679
send me some out so I shipped him out a

456
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:57,720
small little bit of flow so he could

457
00:18:55,679 --> 00:19:00,120
watchh just to see and and you know

458
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:02,480
obviously pictures one thing and at

459
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:06,359
least he could put a tpine profile to

460
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:09,159
the to the photo anyway um and at that

461
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:11,439
point now I just pretty much continue to

462
00:19:09,159 --> 00:19:14,799
run it out and try to get all I can out

463
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:16,600
of her uh trying to push her as much as

464
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:20,200
I can and I know Marcus had said you

465
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:23,480
can't really wave a a magic wand and be

466
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:26,360
a a a full melt grower right off the bat

467
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:30,120
so I'm definitely a a little dragonfly

468
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:31,959
in training I'm going to say uh but that

469
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:36,079
that's pretty much the story of where

470
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:38,480
where you know how it came to be and um

471
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:41,158
yeah mad respect to you all like I don't

472
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,720
think honestly it would exist without

473
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:43,840
the knowledge drops that you guys have

474
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,400
done in the

475
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:51,199
past Mark those designs that you dropped

476
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:54,280
on there what were they from and uh why

477
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:56,319
did you select those on the packaging

478
00:19:54,279 --> 00:19:58,839
that's pretty epic all in all to send

479
00:19:56,319 --> 00:20:00,399
such one a nice packaging but of course

480
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:02,639
you wanted to make an impression and

481
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:05,280
apparently you very much did so how'd

482
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:08,120
you go about the art selection

483
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:11,319
process uh to be honest that's a it was

484
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:13,918
the temporary tattoos so it was quite

485
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:15,599
easy there were like an armband tattoo

486
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:18,038
you would purchase that you would just

487
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:20,439
stick on and I thought you know I got to

488
00:20:18,038 --> 00:20:22,319
go all out and make a little impression

489
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:24,679
for Marcus that I've you know took a

490
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:27,240
little extra care this time and thought

491
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:29,960
what what the heck why

492
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:32,720
not how many weeks is the uh is the

493
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:35,640
cultivar in terms of flowering times um

494
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,960
and what are you doing um you want to

495
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,559
talk to talk a little bit about what

496
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:42,000
you're vegging how long you're vegging

497
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:46,158
for and um what you think the the cult

498
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:49,400
ofar likes and what have you seen so

499
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:52,400
far yeah thanks col I'm a big fan of

500
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:53,919
yours too dude I I mad respect to the

501
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,679
hash you've been making too I've been

502
00:20:53,919 --> 00:21:00,640
checking that out all you guys man it's

503
00:20:56,679 --> 00:21:02,559
it's incredible uh but but veg time has

504
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:06,120
changed I've just been pretty much

505
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:11,079
playing around with it um the node

506
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:14,519
spacing could be tighter um if flower

507
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:17,678
time sits which I'm experimenting with

508
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:21,440
uh sits about anywhere from I'm guessing

509
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:24,720
55 to 60 days somewhere in that

510
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:26,960
neighborhood um the one thing that I did

511
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,558
and I think Bubble Man may be seen some

512
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,759
photos of is I was harvesting fresh

513
00:21:29,558 --> 00:21:34,038
frozen

514
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:36,240
flour once every about four days as it

515
00:21:34,038 --> 00:21:38,798
was growing late in flour and trying to

516
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:43,000
run hash that way in Mason jards just to

517
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:44,879
see how it actually acts and you know at

518
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,640
what point is is it going to smoke the

519
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,760
best so I got a lot of work to do yet

520
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:52,919
but just trying to get all I can out of

521
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:56,038
her how much does she usually yield on a

522
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:56,038
wash percentage

523
00:21:56,839 --> 00:22:02,759
wise um

524
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:05,240
I've even pushed probably closer to

525
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:09,240
quarter pound per

526
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:12,440
plant that's in a 4x4 single plant run

527
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:14,200
though you know it's not it's not a huge

528
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:16,798
yielding plant there's no doubt about

529
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:18,919
that doesn't have uh but I you know I

530
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:21,720
think Frost makes up for the yield

531
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:24,960
myself when you wash her what percentage

532
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:27,240
of uh rosin are you left with in the end

533
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:30,679
um I was for the rosin I was getting

534
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:33,359
back anywhere from 20 to the highest I

535
00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:35,759
got was 22% so

536
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:37,639
far it's not too bad at all I

537
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:39,359
unfortunately when I washed it was I

538
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:42,400
didn't have a scale and I was unable to

539
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:44,599
do the math on the returns I think from

540
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,400
a bubble has perspective it was probably

541
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:48,678
around like 14

542
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,798
15% uh but I wasn't actually able to do

543
00:22:48,679 --> 00:22:52,640
the accurate math I did squish a little

544
00:22:50,798 --> 00:22:56,639
Ros and and I also got I got a little

545
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:59,559
under I think I got around like 16 14 to

546
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:01,120
16 I only I got to admit felt bad having

547
00:22:59,558 --> 00:23:03,000
this guy's flower and I didn't want to

548
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:04,599
like smoke it all and press it all and

549
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,679
wash it all I was just like you know

550
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:09,519
I'll I'll make it and then I'll send it

551
00:23:06,679 --> 00:23:11,600
back to him so I've got 99% of his hash

552
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:13,278
I did uh someone did just ask me hey why

553
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:15,278
don't you just take a quick little bowl

554
00:23:13,278 --> 00:23:18,319
so I've got a little bit right here I'm

555
00:23:15,278 --> 00:23:20,079
going to dump in the old Bowl right now

556
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:23,439
and it's definitely bubbling and and

557
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:23,439
melting and and and

558
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:30,679
boiling and just another thing qu to

559
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:33,440
mention is that you know

560
00:23:30,679 --> 00:23:35,320
hopefully one day all you guys get a

561
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,759
chance to grow it out that would be

562
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:39,798
super cool that was kind of my overall

563
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:42,200
goal was you know eventually if all you

564
00:23:39,798 --> 00:23:45,879
guys could have the cut or if at least

565
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:47,640
you wanted to try it out um that that

566
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:50,000
kind of was my goal eventually would be

567
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,000
super

568
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:58,278
cool very cool

569
00:23:55,278 --> 00:24:01,319
man it's it's good there's no doubt

570
00:23:58,278 --> 00:24:02,359
about about it it's reminiscent of that

571
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:05,200
sort

572
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:07,519
of Dutch Treat flavor it doesn't have a

573
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,840
really super there's not a fruity flavor

574
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:14,000
to it I hear what you're saying with the

575
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:17,079
gassy flavor but even in this dab it's

576
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,679
it's more like a Musky kind of I don't

577
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:21,639
know just like a Dutch Treat really nice

578
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:24,120
that was my first high of The Day My

579
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:26,200
Little My waking bake if you will uh and

580
00:24:24,119 --> 00:24:28,439
very much like right in right in here

581
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:31,720
almost like a headband feeling pretty

582
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:34,038
good it's got a really nice high when I

583
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,200
first hit it I was like oh it's it's the

584
00:24:34,038 --> 00:24:37,359
hash church it's got to have the most

585
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,278
resin it's got to knock people out and I

586
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:41,918
HIIT it and I didn't get knocked out but

587
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:43,679
I realized I don't need it to knock me

588
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:45,480
out I've got like wedding cake and some

589
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:47,240
other cultivars that are nice and heavy

590
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:49,599
that I can go to bed with but this one

591
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:52,159
was a really nice sort of you know a lot

592
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:54,319
of my hashes I've got congales in the

593
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:56,278
morning that's the one that lifts me up

594
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:58,720
you know I hit the heavier ones in the

595
00:24:56,278 --> 00:25:01,240
evening and I hit some of the real tasty

596
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:03,798
kind of upbeat ones in the middle of the

597
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:07,079
day as to not burn out and fall asleep

598
00:25:03,798 --> 00:25:08,879
but hash Church funny enough I can hit

599
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:10,439
it in any of those categories I'm happy

600
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,679
to hit it at night I'm happy to hit it

601
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:16,200
in the morning I haven't hit it much but

602
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:18,640
I know how bad I want to hit it and

603
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:20,360
that's generally what decides for me if

604
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,080
I like something it's very easy if I

605
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:25,000
have something on my desk that sits for

606
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:26,798
a month and it's not really generally

607
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,919
something that I'm that I'm excited

608
00:25:26,798 --> 00:25:30,960
about or that I'm feeling good about so

609
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:33,320
hash Church definitely is a nice

610
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,399
cultivar I would I'm going to get clones

611
00:25:33,319 --> 00:25:38,000
back from Flav so I can actually grow it

612
00:25:35,398 --> 00:25:39,719
in my tent try and get one over to some

613
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,278
over to Johnny B and maybe to the

614
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:45,679
dragonfly Earth medicine folks and any

615
00:25:42,278 --> 00:25:47,919
of the other Canadian um yeah welcome by

616
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:50,200
the way you guys welcome by the way I

617
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:53,200
have one one quick question just uh for

618
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:55,840
Mark real quick uh if when you water

619
00:25:53,200 --> 00:26:00,240
wash it which Micron had the best uh

620
00:25:55,839 --> 00:26:00,240
glands on it for hash chur

621
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:07,558
90 120 going back to yeah I'm going back

622
00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:10,798
to that very first wash at 10 that I did

623
00:26:07,558 --> 00:26:13,200
the first run um it dumped in 120 and

624
00:26:10,798 --> 00:26:15,519
had a beautiful beautiful melt point and

625
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,960
I hadn't been able to achieve that since

626
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:20,480
for some strange reason it seems to be

627
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:24,319
all in the you know my last few runs of

628
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:27,880
it have been in the 70 and the 90 73 and

629
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:31,079
90 that's what I saw as well uh I just

630
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:33,240
hit the 73 and it it really is a nice

631
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:36,319
Vibe hash like there's no doubt about

632
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:39,359
that the plant looks beautiful under uh

633
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:41,599
the macro lens maybe I can actually um

634
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:43,839
find I'm pretty sure I photographed it

635
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:46,398
and uploaded those pictures unless

636
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:47,959
they're on my camera right now in which

637
00:26:46,398 --> 00:26:49,759
case obviously I would not be able to

638
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:50,960
open them up but let me just go look

639
00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:54,879
real quick and

640
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:59,319
see if I can't find at least a

641
00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:01,919
few macro shots of

642
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:03,519
the this plant we love so much okay so

643
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:05,759
yeah I think I do I'll have to open it

644
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:07,319
up in Lightroom give me a second here

645
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:09,480
welcome to the dragonfly Earth medicine

646
00:27:07,319 --> 00:27:11,038

know and I love the idea that we're all

661
00:27:41,798 --> 00:27:46,079
sharing it and learning about it and

662
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:47,839
stuff and it's just uh it's an exciting

663
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:49,720
time it gives us something positive to

664
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:52,398
to think about and work with the plant

665
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:54,480
and everything so good to see everyone

666
00:27:52,398 --> 00:27:56,038
this morning and just when we think that

667
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,558
you know like all of the best strains

668
00:27:56,038 --> 00:27:59,720
are already out there it's really

669
00:27:57,558 --> 00:28:01,678
awesome to see a new one come out and

670
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:04,440
then and then how it rolls out and how

671
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:06,559
we're looking at it and it's just really

672
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:08,640
awesome conversation this morning good

673
00:28:06,558 --> 00:28:12,119
job on the Clone delivery as well I'll

674
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:14,320
have to Second That Emotion yeah yeah

675

thank

676
00:28:14,679 --> 00:28:19,000
you keep chatting guys I'm looking for

677
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:22,759
these pictures here and I can't both

678
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:26,000
chat and so Mark um you said at first it

679
00:28:22,759 --> 00:28:28,278
came out heavy on the 120 and then now

680
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,880
you find it coming out more you know

681
00:28:28,278 --> 00:28:34,679
heavy on the 70 and 90 do you have any

682
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:37,200
gut feelings or intuition about that um

683
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:37,200
in your

684
00:28:37,319 --> 00:28:42,000
experience uh I I just I'm a little

685
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,600
confused by that I actually had

686
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,960
mentioned that to bubble man that the

687
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:47,918
very first run was all in the 120 and

688
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:50,159
and for some reason it's just you know

689
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:52,559
I'm getting a big amount in the 90 and

690
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:55,919
the 73 and even the

691
00:28:52,558 --> 00:28:58,839
45 um the melty is sitting in the 90 the

692
00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:02,799
last couple runs so

693
00:28:58,839 --> 00:29:06,240
uh I I I'm just trying to find that I

694
00:29:02,798 --> 00:29:08,599
guess um I I've started using live worm

695
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:11,120
castings and that was kind of stemmed on

696
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:14,319
by you guys as well I've kind of Taken

697
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:17,879
and started composting in indoor using

698
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:19,480
uh a live worm casting worm B and I

699
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:21,679
believe you know it's it's getting

700
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:24,919
approaching about three years old now

701
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:27,278
and and the the microbiology and you

702
00:29:24,919 --> 00:29:29,759
know like you can just pop it open and

703
00:29:27,278 --> 00:29:32,599
you're seeing all the the

704
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:34,839
microbes all the tiny little beneficial

705
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:37,678
bugs got some questions for you Mark I

706
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:40,278
was just curious on like temperatures uh

707
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:42,320
DLI if you know what your da integrals

708
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:44,919
are if you if you're running like your

709
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:47,319
VPD uh what's your temperatures humidity

710
00:29:44,919 --> 00:29:49,480
levels like I'm really curious on the

711
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:51,439
strain because of course I do so many

712
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:53,120
testings on different varieties so I'm

713
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,080
kind of curious on like how are you

714
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:57,639
running the

715
00:29:55,079 --> 00:30:00,798
strength hey Johnny a big big fan of

716
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:02,480
YouTube brother um I I just going to

717
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:04,200
throw this out quick too Johnny because

718
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,278
I know you're running LEDs so the two

719
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:09,159
lights that I've been running with this

720
00:30:06,278 --> 00:30:12,038
particular cultivar were the op the 8

721
00:30:09,159 --> 00:30:16,200
and uh the electric sky

722
00:30:12,038 --> 00:30:19,879
300s I've had the most success um under

723
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:22,440
that electric sky uh both are you know

724
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:27,159
getting huge amount of frost but

725
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:30,159
Electric Sky seems to excel I I'm not

726
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:32,679
sure and you know I got a total draw

727
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:34,720
watt for my two electric Skies can

728
00:30:32,679 --> 00:30:37,480
approach to be about 600 watts if I

729
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:39,960
fully crank them and this cultivar likes

730
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:42,480
to sit about the 300 mark which is you

731
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:45,240
know quite quite low lighting so I think

732
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:48,558
it likes uh particularly low lighting

733
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:51,640
compared to my optic8 is is you know

734
00:30:48,558 --> 00:30:52,599
crazy amount of it's it's bright those

735
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:55,399
cob

736
00:30:52,599 --> 00:30:57,798
lights um so it just prefers a little

737
00:30:55,398 --> 00:31:01,319
bit of a lower lighting as far as VPD I

738
00:30:57,798 --> 00:31:05,158
have haven't really messed with BPD too

739
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:06,759
much um yeah dude I I I just haven't

740
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:10,480
really messed with that I kind of did a

741
00:31:06,759 --> 00:31:13,079
little bit but uh I found that that BPD

742
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,798
is a little strange as far as how high

743
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:17,759
they you know they wanted the humidity

744
00:31:14,798 --> 00:31:19,759
at certain points just seemed like a

745
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:24,558
almost a nightmare ready to begin as far

746
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:26,519
as PM but um I I could see uh uh trying

747
00:31:24,558 --> 00:31:28,678
to get into you know a little bit better

748
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:30,798
range of that over time hopefully it's

749
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:34,559
hard to dial into my basement the way

750
00:31:30,798 --> 00:31:37,119
I'm growing in just a small 4x4 t0 so oh

751
00:31:34,558 --> 00:31:39,319
God that really changes

752
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:41,918
everything is really hard to control so

753
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:47,278
I understand that are you planning on

754
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:47,278
making any seed or germ plasm of hash

755
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:53,839
Church sorry atan I didn't get that are

756
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:56,519
you planning on making any seeds or germ

757
00:31:53,839 --> 00:32:01,199
plasm of hash

758
00:31:56,519 --> 00:32:02,960
Church besides I know it's you what

759
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:05,159
you'll have to explain germ plasm that's

760
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:11,159
new one to me that's just another word

761
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:13,519
for seeds oh okay um I'm sitting the f1s

762
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:17,120
I'm sitting on about 180

763
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:19,480
and math says if I've only popped one of

764
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:21,879
those seeds happen to be the hasch I've

765
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:23,319
popped I think four more just to run the

766
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:26,519
outdoor just to see what they were going

767
00:32:23,319 --> 00:32:29,759
to actually be like still Frosty and and

768
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:31,519
turpy but not quite like that first one

769
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:34,519
and I you know math says there's got to

770
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:36,638
be some other ones in that package uh

771
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:42,000
I'd like to make an F2 cross though

772
00:32:36,638 --> 00:32:44,199
eventually but uh I'm just kind of uh

773
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,919
following bubble man's guidance kind of

774
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,919
with this one of what he recommends

775
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:55,200
honestly I want to an opinion um one of

776
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:58,399
the things that I learned early on in

777
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:00,319
this work is that the health and

778
00:32:58,398 --> 00:33:03,038
vitality of the mother plant that you're

779
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:06,278
taking cuting from has a lot to do with

780
00:33:03,038 --> 00:33:09,759
the Vitality of those cuting once you

781
00:33:06,278 --> 00:33:12,200
try growing them out and so if your

782
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:15,119
Nursery your mother plants are also in

783
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:18,440
that 4x4 tint or in that same

784
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:21,199
basement uh it's likely the

785
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:22,679
uh the Vitality of those mothers might

786
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,240
be deteriorating and that's why you're

787
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:29,440
seeing a reduction in the size of your

788
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:31,278
tricomes just a thought yeah agree Wade

789
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,919
um I've had a tough time actually

790
00:33:31,278 --> 00:33:35,200
keeping the original mother alive she's

791
00:33:32,919 --> 00:33:39,320
looking a lot better than it did about a

792
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:41,759
month ago uh but yeah it's it's it's

793
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:43,759
tough I'm finding it super tough to keep

794
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:46,038
a a mother around for as long as I have

795
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:47,359
now and um just trying to keep her as

796
00:33:46,038 --> 00:33:50,398
healthy as possible like you had

797
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:52,519
mentioned and uh yeah I realized that if

798
00:33:50,398 --> 00:33:53,918
the healthy healthier the mother is the

799
00:33:52,519 --> 00:33:56,919
better the Clones are going to be for

800
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:56,919
sure

801
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:03,798
yeah I second what Wade saying about

802
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:07,319
propagation uh propagation is the most

803
00:34:03,798 --> 00:34:11,519
important part of your cycle

804
00:34:07,319 --> 00:34:13,799
um if you don't start with the right uh

805
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:15,119
cuts and take care of them uh you're

806
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,800
going to have a really hard time through

807
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:20,639
your through your growth

808
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:23,519
cycle so um rejuven rejuvenating those

809
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:26,760
moms often or is usually very

810
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:30,039
helpful and um don't give up on it it's

811
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:33,440
it's it's it's a battle

812
00:34:30,039 --> 00:34:35,398
sometimes Ohad

813
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:38,480
no come on

814
00:34:35,398 --> 00:34:40,799
now um you know with mothers too you

815
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,679
know I mean I broad mites and and russet

816
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,800
mites have been around for a good amount

817
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:48,000
of time for a lot of people but you'd be

818
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:51,599
unbelievably surprised how often they

819
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,878
still go by without being diagnosed yeah

820
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:58,079
and the only way to really know whether

821
00:34:53,878 --> 00:35:00,920
you have them is a trained eye you know

822
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:02,320
or a a microscope and looking at the

823
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:04,079
bottom of the leaf and it doesn't have

824
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:06,838
to be a microscope like a table

825
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:08,760
microscope but one that's around 60 you

826
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:10,559
know and and well and then you look at

827
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:12,520
the bottom of the leaf and at the bottom

828
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:15,199
of the leaf looks like it has tricomes

829
00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:17,079
on it the bottom of the sunleaf you know

830
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:19,199
that there's not tricomes on the bottom

831
00:35:17,079 --> 00:35:22,800
of the sunleaf and that it's broad Mite

832
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:25,559
eggs or rusted eggs and and often the

833
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:28,480
plant can look like it's depleted the

834
00:35:25,559 --> 00:35:30,920
plant can often look like it has hmag

835
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:33,000
deficiency or it doesn't have the growth

836
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:35,159
that it's looking for when really it's

837
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,679
just eat being eaten by a microscopic

838
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:39,519
might so and and people have all kinds

839
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:42,639
of different regimens but you know just

840
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:46,960
the the simple regimen of of a sski and

841
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:49,879
cucko Maris uh Duo of predator mites in

842
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:54,280
with your mother right in with your

843
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:56,800
mother and your clones of course you

844
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:57,839
you're put it in your closet on your put

845
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,280
some of the Predators on your your

846
00:35:57,838 --> 00:36:02,159
closet you uh on your jackets and

847
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:04,560
everything you know just get Predators

848
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:07,920
everywhere eating so you become a

849
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:10,639
beneficial organism when you go around

850
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:12,760
and then um and then as you propagate

851
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:15,639
and put it into the flower room you have

852
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:17,359
another fresh round you know on in the

853
00:36:15,639 --> 00:36:19,719
flower room and then that allows your

854
00:36:17,358 --> 00:36:22,759
plant leaves the leaves of your plants

855
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:25,838
to be flat and people in this community

856
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:28,200
need to understand that flat

857
00:36:25,838 --> 00:36:30,920
leaves and preing

858
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:34,559
is Health that's our goal that's our

859
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:36,519
goal we all the tricomes come all of the

860
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:39,639
the good smoke the Melt everything comes

861
00:36:36,519 --> 00:36:42,039
after you have a flat healthy leafed

862
00:36:39,639 --> 00:36:44,559
plant and that's a h you know something

863
00:36:42,039 --> 00:36:46,880
to for everyone to just re get to know

864
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:49,318
about and I think that you know we go to

865
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:51,838
a lot of uh different Grow rooms and a

866
00:36:49,318 --> 00:36:55,759
lot of outdoor Gardens and I'd say that

867
00:36:51,838 --> 00:36:58,078
in the indoor grow rooms you know a huge

868
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,560
percentage of people have broad m

869
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:01,079
and people always say Hey you know I

870
00:36:59,559 --> 00:37:04,279
don't see the broad mes well if you

871
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:07,599
actually see a m then you're way over

872
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:11,319
infested they're super fast moving

873
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:14,720
they're incredibly fast moving and also

874
00:37:11,318 --> 00:37:17,440
the male broad mites disperse the female

875
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:19,879
eggs throughout the leaf so it's not

876
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:22,318
like you find like a bundle of eggs or

877
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:23,720
anything go ahead John had a question I

878
00:37:22,318 --> 00:37:25,159
like this cuz I'm actually seeing

879
00:37:23,719 --> 00:37:26,799
exactly what you're talking about right

880
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:28,480
now I mean talking about this because

881
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:31,359
what happened is I got some clones from

882
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:33,599
a friend Mark no and Monty went to the

883
00:37:31,358 --> 00:37:35,838
neighbors who had these mites and they

884
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:37,880
were in his bathroom and at the about

885
00:37:35,838 --> 00:37:39,960
week seven I started getting him in my

886
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:42,318
flower room so I I it was didn't make a

887
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:44,159
difference to me um because it came in

888
00:37:42,318 --> 00:37:46,119
but now that I'm seeing him on my mom's

889
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:48,440
I'm like okay next step so I'm on the

890
00:37:46,119 --> 00:37:50,160
bug lady right now I'm like I've always

891
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:52,039
sprayed I've gone around that thing but

892
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:53,759
I don't want to spray this time I'm like

893
00:37:52,039 --> 00:37:57,239
okay you guys are so convinced me right

894
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:59,880
now so right here now bug lady what do I

895
00:37:57,239 --> 00:38:02,639
got order you know

896
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:04,680
like try try to look beneficial

897
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:09,118
nematodes are really helpful as well I

898
00:38:04,679 --> 00:38:11,960
found a lot of comfort in using them um

899
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:14,519
it quite a bit in my soils in the past

900
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:18,480
because just all that all of it together

901
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:20,318
is just a great IPM system and it's I

902
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,599
love what Josh and Kelly are saying it's

903
00:38:20,318 --> 00:38:25,358
it's so needed this is one of the

904
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:27,880
reasons why I have an appreciation for

905
00:38:25,358 --> 00:38:30,078
tissue culture right Meemic tissue

906
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:31,800
culture just just micropropagation

907
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:34,839
you're still cloning but you're cloning

908
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:37,359
like a a tiny tiny tiny tiny little

909
00:38:34,838 --> 00:38:39,880
fraction of the marem and then growing

910
00:38:37,358 --> 00:38:42,679
it up right growing it in this agar

911
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:45,039
medium in a little in a little jar and

912
00:38:42,679 --> 00:38:48,838
it it starts growing and all of its uh

913
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:51,559
fungi and bacteria and viruses it they

914
00:38:48,838 --> 00:38:54,440
they try to keep up but they can't keep

915
00:38:51,559 --> 00:38:56,759
up and so you cut that little marem you

916
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:58,720
get it into their that that Medium which

917
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:00,520
is really the IP that's going to

918
00:38:58,719 --> 00:39:02,879
convince that plant to grow a dominant

919
00:39:00,519 --> 00:39:04,800
Chute and and start growing upwards and

920
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:06,358
so you do this for about four to six

921
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,920
months in tissue culture and they call

922
00:39:06,358 --> 00:39:11,679
it initiation and so what it does is it

923
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:14,960
removes all of those fungi bacterias and

924
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:16,838
viruses by the plant growing faster and

925
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,838
faster and faster so now you've got your

926
00:39:16,838 --> 00:39:21,639
clone you're cutting it up here you've

927
00:39:18,838 --> 00:39:23,199
got your viruses and fungi and bacteria

928
00:39:21,639 --> 00:39:25,159
that are trying to keep up and

929
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:28,439
eventually you can get them out of that

930
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:31,118
plant completely and which is what Wade

931
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:33,679
began this discussion with in regards to

932
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:35,599
hey you know you might have some sort of

933
00:39:33,679 --> 00:39:37,759
thing going on with your mother stock

934
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:41,240
that now the triome production is down

935
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:44,720
well that thing would be fungi bacteria

936
00:39:41,239 --> 00:39:47,159
and viruses impregnating your plant and

937
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:49,838
slowing down its ability to express

938
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:52,719
itself under the perfect conditions that

939
00:39:49,838 --> 00:39:55,318
you're trying to to to to produce for it

940
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:58,118
so had Ian from segra been here today

941
00:39:55,318 --> 00:40:00,719
he's with his uh daughter this morning

942
00:39:58,119 --> 00:40:02,358
so Props to him for being a good dad but

943
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:04,838
I really wanted him to be here and he

944
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:07,559
would have been able to uh say what I

945
00:40:04,838 --> 00:40:10,838
just said much more elegantly and maybe

946
00:40:07,559 --> 00:40:13,480
even clearer but well not only that not

947
00:40:10,838 --> 00:40:15,318
only that um you know my other company

948
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:18,639
that I have is bio agronomics group with

949
00:40:15,318 --> 00:40:21,039
Rob Clark and Mojave and our genetics

950
00:40:18,639 --> 00:40:24,000
were just cleaned up by SRA and so on

951
00:40:21,039 --> 00:40:26,599
our bio agronomics site we have three

952
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:29,199
cultivars that were actually fully

953
00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:32,920
biologic cleaned up and it took some

954
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:34,679
time and it's a quite a process but um

955
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:37,559
quite excited that we're getting ready

956
00:40:34,679 --> 00:40:40,078
to put out a press release uh regarding

957
00:40:37,559 --> 00:40:42,119
uh our our cultivar so uh look for that

958
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:43,640
in the coming dude amazing yeah I know

959
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:45,559
all about it I just didn't want to say

960
00:40:43,639 --> 00:40:47,519
anything but amazing that you got to say

961
00:40:45,559 --> 00:40:51,078
it and I can't wait for you to release

962
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:52,838
the uh the uh the public release that'll

963
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:54,519
be awesome to hear about that's really

964
00:40:52,838 --> 00:40:57,679
cool that you're involved with bio

965
00:40:54,519 --> 00:41:00,000
agronomics with Mojave and Rob Clark uh

966
00:40:57,679 --> 00:41:02,239
that's a pretty strong Trio of people

967
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,079
right

968
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:07,039
there very very cool that's a that's a

969

great group right there you are you guys

970
00:41:07,039 --> 00:41:11,239
um are you guys working with any older

971
00:41:09,318 --> 00:41:13,119
older stuff that you can talk about is

972
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:15,838
there anything that's exciting that you

973
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:17,640
wanna tell us about uh you know we're

974
00:41:15,838 --> 00:41:20,519
just in the midst of Licensing you know

975
00:41:17,639 --> 00:41:23,480
we're doing what uh old Driscoll does

976
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:26,280
here in the states which licens uh

977
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:27,760
blackberries and raspberries so we're

978
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:30,119
doing that with

979
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:32,920
uh the older cultivars and genetics that

980
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:35,480
robs has collected over the decades as

981
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:39,318
well as Mojave since he's you know his

982
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:41,240
master botanist so uh we have a few

983
00:41:39,318 --> 00:41:42,759
things that are in the pipes but you

984
00:41:41,239 --> 00:41:45,559
know the contracts and all that we're

985
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:47,560
still waiting for so as those come

986
00:41:45,559 --> 00:41:50,440
forward we'll be more more than happy to

987
00:41:47,559 --> 00:41:52,799
to make those aware but and you know

988
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:56,000
contracts but uh yes there's a lot of

989
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:58,480
interest as well as uh especially toward

990
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,920
the old world genetics because they're

991
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:03,358
just so missing on top of that you know

992
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:05,039
we were subjective to such as Dave's

993
00:42:03,358 --> 00:42:07,719
palette Dave liked the sweeter type of

994
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:10,559
palette so now we'll have access to the

995
00:42:07,719 --> 00:42:13,159
full range of the older pallet for new

996
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:15,799
cultivars to be developed and made from

997
00:42:13,159 --> 00:42:18,639
so uh that's what I'm most excited about

998
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:20,720
is to to you know bring back the old so

999
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:22,679
that we can pull out some of those

1000
00:42:20,719 --> 00:42:25,239
things that we miss because we've all

1001
00:42:22,679 --> 00:42:28,199
been subjective to the pallets of the

1002
00:42:25,239 --> 00:42:30,039
actual botanists who have made these PL

1003
00:42:28,199 --> 00:42:32,118
and there may be some that I like that

1004
00:42:30,039 --> 00:42:35,440
you not like or there may be some

1005
00:42:32,119 --> 00:42:37,680
nuances that we're going to find but um

1006
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:39,519
yeah it's gonna be an exciting next

1007
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:41,960
couple of years for sure that's awesome

1008
00:42:39,519 --> 00:42:44,400
that's awesome at the same time I just

1009
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:48,599
uh took cuts and and reup a bunch of

1010
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:51,800
older stuff um that I've kept for around

1011
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:53,838
21 years to date and it's um it's been a

1012
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:56,200
battle for to keep these things going

1013
00:42:53,838 --> 00:42:58,719
but um you know it's I'm in the same

1014
00:42:56,199 --> 00:43:01,239
boat I've had my stuff for 15 18 years

1015
00:42:58,719 --> 00:43:03,358
20 years the Northern Light number five

1016
00:43:01,239 --> 00:43:04,959
like the I call medic Kush is more like

1017
00:43:03,358 --> 00:43:07,239
a pure kush if you look at the land

1018
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:09,199
races and the strains that were around

1019
00:43:07,239 --> 00:43:11,078
back in the days and just the eror and

1020
00:43:09,199 --> 00:43:13,879
the time that I was in place of just

1021
00:43:11,079 --> 00:43:16,160
genetics I got myself on some of those

1022
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:18,920
those rare ones those first ogs those

1023
00:43:16,159 --> 00:43:20,799
first Hindu kushes and Bubba kushes and

1024
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:22,639
the lemon ties I'm well that's all we

1025
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,119
ran that's all my friends said we laugh

1026
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:26,400
about said that's all we used to run

1027
00:43:24,119 --> 00:43:27,960
back in those days and right was all the

1028
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,440
seeds we were popping and I'm hearing

1029
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:30,838
stories about this and we're like we're

1030
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:33,400
laughing I said that's the one I called

1031
00:43:30,838 --> 00:43:35,719
an M4 cuz it was a it was the fourth cut

1032
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:38,000
of the M of this and it came out some

1033
00:43:35,719 --> 00:43:40,358
name over there and it's it's pretty

1034
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,719
cool to start seeing how people are

1035
00:43:40,358 --> 00:43:43,279
looking at those old genetics and

1036
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:45,000
realizing that that's where the fire

1037
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:47,119
started and that's what they need in

1038
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,719
order to kind of there's a lot of a lot

1039
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:51,119
of stuff out there it tastes really good

1040
00:43:48,719 --> 00:43:53,000
but it just doesn't get you there you

1041
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:55,079
know it's like it's like it's nice but

1042
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,440
it's like doesn't give me that punch

1043
00:43:55,079 --> 00:43:58,318
though I'm still that's the problem

1044
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:00,400
we're all going in different

1045
00:43:58,318 --> 00:44:02,838
places

1046
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:05,400
yeah there's a lot of theirs could be

1047
00:44:02,838 --> 00:44:08,239
the beauty beauty of it all though too

1048
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:10,119
hidden beauty of course every you know I

1049
00:44:08,239 --> 00:44:12,719
I kind of appreciate the older varieties

1050
00:44:10,119 --> 00:44:15,640
that that are um that are more floral

1051
00:44:12,719 --> 00:44:18,279
and more ecuatorial um they they have um

1052
00:44:15,639 --> 00:44:21,358
a certain Entourage effect to them that

1053
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:22,800
I I don't get from a lot of uh the newer

1054
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:24,440
stuff that I that I some like that

1055
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:26,240
peanut butter breath that came to me one

1056
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:27,720
time it was just like oh I have to have

1057
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:29,558
it please and

1058
00:44:27,719 --> 00:44:31,519
someone else had this wedding crash I'm

1059
00:44:29,559 --> 00:44:33,480
like can you can I get that cut from you

1060
00:44:31,519 --> 00:44:35,679
like by any chance because it's just so

1061
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:37,159
tasty I like that I mean it's the

1062
00:44:35,679 --> 00:44:39,399
variety is out there with the Breeders

1063
00:44:37,159 --> 00:44:41,679
and the people just popping and growing

1064
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:43,639
for 2021 it's just like a whole new

1065
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:46,199
beginning a whole new whole new

1066
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:48,440
generation of of Growers and seeds and

1067
00:44:46,199 --> 00:44:50,358
varietals coming out there it's it's

1068
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:52,159
pretty cool it's it's really nice to see

1069
00:44:50,358 --> 00:44:54,358
that 20201 is going to be a growing year

1070
00:44:52,159 --> 00:44:56,519
for everybody and looking forward to all

1071
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:58,639
these new strains but let's try and find

1072
00:44:56,519 --> 00:44:59,960
those genetic that they're com from

1073
00:44:58,639 --> 00:45:02,598
because some of these names I hear I'm

1074
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:05,519
like what is that I'm on seedfinder it

1075
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:07,079
doesn't exist like like give me tell me

1076
00:45:05,519 --> 00:45:09,159
what these strains are where are they

1077
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:12,240
coming from like what are their parents

1078
00:45:09,159 --> 00:45:13,719
right and and it's it's like they just

1079
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:15,519
you can't call this you got to call

1080
00:45:13,719 --> 00:45:18,000
something else and then now you don't

1081
00:45:15,519 --> 00:45:20,639
know what it is so

1082
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,920
well sorry go ahead Kelly I was just

1083
00:45:20,639 --> 00:45:23,519
saying I think that it's more important

1084
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:25,800
than ever like I know I had said this

1085
00:45:23,519 --> 00:45:29,159
one time before on hash church is to pop

1086
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:31,400
those 2021 because of all the intention

1087
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:33,799
that went into the 2020 you know

1088
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:35,960
breeding time you know we're all in this

1089
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:37,720
crazy lockdown there's so much energy

1090
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:41,519
going on we're all dealing with really

1091
00:45:37,719 --> 00:45:43,159
heightened emotions or heartstrings and

1092
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:45,280
all of this energy has been going into

1093
00:45:43,159 --> 00:45:48,239
our Gardens and now we have this great

1094
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:50,839
opportunity to pop these 21 you know

1095
00:45:48,239 --> 00:45:52,919
seeds that see what kind of answers that

1096
00:45:50,838 --> 00:45:55,159
the plant can give us as a as a

1097
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:57,119
collective Consciousness so super

1098
00:45:55,159 --> 00:45:58,639
exciting to me and I love it that you

1099
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:00,119
know John you're you're really you know

1100
00:45:58,639 --> 00:46:02,480
bringing up the energy of popping those

1101
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:04,480
seeds so I'm encouraging everybody share

1102
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:06,719
your seeds pop them let's get them out

1103
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:08,960
there let's let's let's really let

1104
00:46:06,719 --> 00:46:12,399
cannabis you know do what she's meant to

1105
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:14,000
do which is really heal heal the planet

1106
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,880
well that's why I was asking Mark about

1107
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,280
seeds earlier but you know it's

1108
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:20,358
interesting um I got selected to be a

1109
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:22,160
judge for the emerald cup uh and it's

1110
00:46:20,358 --> 00:46:23,838
happening in the spring this year

1111
00:46:22,159 --> 00:46:26,759
unfortunately it's not a gathering but

1112
00:46:23,838 --> 00:46:30,358
we're going to be doing the um you know

1113
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:31,880
the the uh sampling and judging part uh

1114
00:46:30,358 --> 00:46:34,558
this year they're actually going to be

1115
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:37,760
be doing it by tarpine profile they're

1116
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:41,440
not doing it by names so it's GNA be

1117
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:43,319
very interesting to see how because we

1118
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:46,519
had I've always had the issue of names

1119
00:46:43,318 --> 00:46:49,358
or suggestions or tars Etc so now we're

1120
00:46:46,519 --> 00:46:52,280
going to be issued them by tpine profile

1121
00:46:49,358 --> 00:46:54,119
so that's going to be very interesting

1122
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:57,680
uh SC Labs is actually doing all the

1123
00:46:54,119 --> 00:47:00,079
testing again and uh we're they're still

1124
00:46:57,679 --> 00:47:02,000
receiving currently for the next couple

1125
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:06,400
of weeks uh so you can go to the emerald

1126
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:08,679
cup uh uh online and if you are domestic

1127
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:11,079
uh they're also having a traditional

1128
00:47:08,679 --> 00:47:13,399
Market cup as well so it's not just a

1129

1134

going to be very inter to see how

1135
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:31,200

say something go ahead no I got one

1167
00:48:37,838 --> 00:48:40,719
other thing I wanted to say we were

1168
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:44,358
talking about all the beautiful old

1169
00:48:40,719 --> 00:48:46,358
cultivars that are coming to hand maybe

1170
00:48:44,358 --> 00:48:49,759
uh at Johan thank you for doing that

1171
00:48:46,358 --> 00:48:52,598
work um and others everybody uh I want

1172
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,920
to add in not just tpes like everybody's

1173
00:48:52,599 --> 00:48:57,200
talking about all the different

1174
00:48:53,920 --> 00:49:00,559
experiences that primarily type one

1175
00:48:57,199 --> 00:49:03,480
cannabis THC gives you and I'm really a

1176
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:05,599
big fan as you probably know of type two

1177
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:08,280
cannabis where you've got THC and CBD

1178
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:11,960
and other conoids together and I think

1179
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:15,480
that's part of the minor conoids and CBD

1180
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:20,280
in relation to THC is where I think the

1181
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:22,639
Feelgood part of cannabis usage comes in

1182
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:25,359
type one high THC is really about

1183
00:49:22,639 --> 00:49:26,879
psychoactivity and and it's can get

1184
00:49:25,358 --> 00:49:28,239
literally psychedelic we were talking

1185
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:30,240
about mushrooms last week and I was

1186
00:49:28,239 --> 00:49:33,519
thinking about people whose first

1187
00:49:30,239 --> 00:49:36,919
experience with cannabis was a really

1188
00:49:33,519 --> 00:49:38,358
fat edible that some friend gave them

1189
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:41,559
that because they said they wanted to

1190
00:49:38,358 --> 00:49:43,558
try cannabis so they got a 150 milligram

1191
00:49:41,559 --> 00:49:47,880
dose of THC the very first time they

1192
00:49:43,559 --> 00:49:51,960
ever tried it and got obliterated I mean

1193
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:57,838
that I've had that experience

1194
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:59,599
myself and it's um anyway yeah cannabis

1195
00:49:57,838 --> 00:50:01,719
can be not just about getting high but

1196
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:03,559
it can also be about feeling good and I

1197
00:50:01,719 --> 00:50:06,279
think that's one of the things that I'm

1198
00:50:03,559 --> 00:50:08,920
personally very excited about because it

1199
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:10,760
works in my life makes me feel good

1200
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:12,280
makes me feel happy I like being happy

1201
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:15,079
people like oh you're a stone I'm like

1202
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:17,079
so I like being happy so I I use

1203
00:50:15,079 --> 00:50:19,000
cannabis Because I'm Happy it makes me

1204
00:50:17,079 --> 00:50:21,000
happy and I'm addicted to being happy

1205
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,920
I'm addicted to feeling good and

1206
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:25,280
cannabis makes me feel good so what's

1207
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:26,920
wrong with that like nothing wrong with

1208
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:28,680
feeling good that's the best thing it's

1209
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:31,240
like we feel good and if that makes you

1210
00:50:28,679 --> 00:50:32,639
feel good then that's fantastic and and

1211
00:50:31,239 --> 00:50:34,399
and someone's mentioned something on my

1212
00:50:32,639 --> 00:50:36,558
Facebook page oh you're just a junkie

1213
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,920
and I mean people like like s Mission

1214
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:40,960
some people are just like ragging on the

1215
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:43,838
sky like I use cannabis because it makes

1216
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:46,318
me feel good and that is the best part

1217
00:50:43,838 --> 00:50:48,558
about being who we what we do we use it

1218
00:50:46,318 --> 00:50:50,719
because it makes us feel good it it it

1219
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:52,599
inspires our mind it makes us do better

1220
00:50:50,719 --> 00:50:54,118
things for ourselves or for others I

1221
00:50:52,599 --> 00:50:56,480
mean most people smoke a joint want to

1222
00:50:54,119 --> 00:50:57,960
help people oh hey can I help you can I

1223
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:00,519
do do something for you like look at

1224
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:03,000
this cannabis community and uh the I

1225
00:51:00,519 --> 00:51:05,838
think that the walls are down things are

1226
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:08,760
changing people are growing and enough

1227
00:51:05,838 --> 00:51:11,078
of what's happening and and let's goow

1228
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:13,280
forward for 2021 that's that's the whole

1229
00:51:11,079 --> 00:51:15,318
idea there are some major obstacles for

1230
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:17,839
Californians this year with the fire

1231
00:51:15,318 --> 00:51:19,679
development and the widening of Roads

1232
00:51:17,838 --> 00:51:21,480
there's a lot of people in California

1233
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:24,358
that are feeling like their whole entire

1234
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:26,079
growing season is under threat with new

1235
00:51:24,358 --> 00:51:27,598
law their whole Farm not their season

1236
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:30,359
their whole Farm is under threat for

1237
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:33,440
them to be able to receive a new license

1238
00:51:30,358 --> 00:51:36,000
so if they don't widen the roads to

1239
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:39,318
where there's a truck turnaround that

1240
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:41,079
every fire truck can make a turnaround

1241
00:51:39,318 --> 00:51:44,279
that they're not going to allow any

1242
00:51:41,079 --> 00:51:48,519
licensing of any type of businesses up

1243
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:51,319
those roads so a tremendous amount of

1244
00:51:48,519 --> 00:51:54,239
California licensed Farms are under

1245
00:51:51,318 --> 00:51:55,960
threat right now um and a lot of uh the

1246
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:58,118
farms and a lot of people who are very

1247
00:51:55,960 --> 00:52:00,440
politically involved feel like it's a

1248
00:51:58,119 --> 00:52:03,079
definite attack against the small

1249
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:06,119
cannabis farmer rather than just a good

1250
00:52:03,079 --> 00:52:09,240
idea for wildf virus in in California

1251
00:52:06,119 --> 00:52:11,480
there's lots of other ways that um you

1252
00:52:09,239 --> 00:52:13,639
know things could happen other than the

1253
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:15,838
farmers are responsible for widening the

1254
00:52:13,639 --> 00:52:18,199
roads or basically put everybody out of

1255
00:52:15,838 --> 00:52:20,318

says oh I'm addicted to feeling good and

1276
00:53:08,159 --> 00:53:13,838
that's why I smoke cannabis we're

1277
00:53:10,239 --> 00:53:17,519
addicted to to to helping the Earth

1278
00:53:13,838 --> 00:53:19,679
while we create cannabis to feel good so

1279
00:53:17,519 --> 00:53:22,559
we're creating all these systems to say

1280
00:53:19,679 --> 00:53:26,798
hey the Earth is also ailing and so I'm

1281
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:30,240
not going to take a a a a a compound or

1282
00:53:26,798 --> 00:53:33,358
or a plant like cannabis grow it

1283
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:35,479
degenerativa human Humanity so like I

1284
00:53:33,358 --> 00:53:37,519
just want to encourage people to

1285
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:39,119
recognize that all of the actions that

1286
00:53:37,519 --> 00:53:40,759
you do are part of the health and

1287
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:43,079
well-being that we're going you know

1288
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:45,280
that we're moving towards and uh we're

1289
00:53:43,079 --> 00:53:48,119
working really really hard on on um

1290
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:50,839
making our medicine available um in

1291
00:53:48,119 --> 00:53:52,680
Canada and creating a new website for

1292
00:53:50,838 --> 00:53:55,199
Compassionate Care to make it available

1293
00:53:52,679 --> 00:53:57,598
to patients for medical patients in

1294
00:53:55,199 --> 00:54:00,639
Canada so this is going to be a really

1295
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:02,160
big new step for us and and uh we're

1296
00:54:00,639 --> 00:54:04,679
really excited about it and it's not

1297
00:54:02,159 --> 00:54:07,358
finished yet so we can't share exact

1298
00:54:04,679 --> 00:54:10,960
details on it but uh I think it's for

1299
00:54:07,358 --> 00:54:12,598
the betterment of all people on Earth

1300
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:14,798
and I hope it's all going to be great

1301
00:54:12,599 --> 00:54:16,720
for uh Canadians and also it's called

1302
00:54:14,798 --> 00:54:20,000
plant medicine I just want to remind

1303
00:54:16,719 --> 00:54:22,199
everybody it's plant medicine so all of

1304
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:24,079
those plants out there are speaking to

1305
00:54:22,199 --> 00:54:26,679
us as humans we have this long

1306
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:28,798
incredible in-depth history with with

1307
00:54:26,679 --> 00:54:31,039
these plant

1308
00:54:28,798 --> 00:54:32,358
medicines I want to jump in about this

1309
00:54:31,039 --> 00:54:34,798
thing you mentioned happening in

1310
00:54:32,358 --> 00:54:38,039
California and it sounds like in Maine

1311
00:54:34,798 --> 00:54:41,920
as well uh the specifics of it is the

1312
00:54:38,039 --> 00:54:45,719
board of Forestry uh is considering the

1313
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:48,880
new updating of the fire

1314
00:54:45,719 --> 00:54:51,279
regulations and where it applies to

1315
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:53,838
where it affects cannabis Farmers it

1316
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:57,680
also affects everyone who lives in rural

1317
00:54:53,838 --> 00:55:00,119
areas in California because the way it's

1318
00:54:57,679 --> 00:55:03,598
going to play out is if you want a

1319
00:55:00,119 --> 00:55:07,559
permit to do anything like repair the

1320
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:10,480
deck on your house or build a house or

1321
00:55:07,559 --> 00:55:14,200
uh have a cannabis commercial activity

1322
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:17,079
on your property you have to have a road

1323
00:55:14,199 --> 00:55:20,639
that allows a firr to come in and a car

1324
00:55:17,079 --> 00:55:22,680
to come out at the same time which is 20

1325
00:55:20,639 --> 00:55:25,279
feet wide plus a couple of feet wide on

1326
00:55:22,679 --> 00:55:27,838
each side and every so often you have to

1327
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:29,599
have turnouts and it's it's basically

1328
00:55:27,838 --> 00:55:32,880
appropriate if you wanted to put a

1329
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:35,760
Walmart or a gas station or a shopping

1330
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:38,200
center on your farm you would need a

1331
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:40,960
road like that but to require that for

1332
00:55:38,199 --> 00:55:43,558
any kind of permit especially a cannabis

1333
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:46,599
permit means a lot of the Heritage farms

1334
00:55:43,559 --> 00:55:48,960
in California are being faced with the

1335
00:55:46,599 --> 00:55:52,838
environmental impacts of putting in a

1336
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:55,119
commercial scale road to their Farm in

1337
00:55:52,838 --> 00:55:57,960
order to get a permit to get have

1338
00:55:55,119 --> 00:56:00,760
cannabis license and really the whole

1339
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:02,559
idea of legislation or legalization as

1340
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:04,520
it's called it's really

1341
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:09,240
commercialization but the whole idea of

1342
00:56:04,519 --> 00:56:12,038
legalization was to give Heritage free

1343
00:56:09,239 --> 00:56:15,239
market Farmers a chance a way to come

1344
00:56:12,039 --> 00:56:17,039
into compliance with the law this this

1345
00:56:15,239 --> 00:56:19,639
effort through the board of Forestry is

1346
00:56:17,039 --> 00:56:22,520
a thinly disguised effort to shut that

1347
00:56:19,639 --> 00:56:25,879
effort down and perpetuate in my opinion

1348
00:56:22,519 --> 00:56:27,000
prohibition and the whole War on Drugs

1349
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:29,519
thing

1350
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:32,880
one last little remnant of

1351
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:36,639
the only a few more days left president

1352
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:39,318
if you will in the United States

1353
00:56:36,639 --> 00:56:41,358
pardon people have to understand that

1354
00:56:39,318 --> 00:56:43,519
most once you get into Northern

1355
00:56:41,358 --> 00:56:45,759
California once you get off the main

1356
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:47,880
roads it's all dirt roads you get up

1357
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:50,640
into Sonoma you get into medino you get

1358
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:52,960
into Humbolt you know that's the reality

1359
00:56:50,639 --> 00:56:57,879
I mean one Farm I went to was literally

1360
00:56:52,960 --> 00:57:01,358
45 minutes off the County Road okay so

1361
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:04,280
it is uh honorous and um very

1362
00:57:01,358 --> 00:57:06,838
frustrating because I was a previously

1363
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:10,440
Legacy Traditional Market grower up in

1364
00:57:06,838 --> 00:57:13,599
mesino myself so we had a farm and we

1365
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:15,519
had legal numbers Etc and then the next

1366
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:19,359
year they changed it from 99 plants to

1367
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:20,920
25 you know so it's unfortunately been a

1368
00:57:19,358 --> 00:57:22,318
frustration because then we lost our

1369
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:24,599
farm because we couldn't afford to keep

1370
00:57:22,318 --> 00:57:26,279
it open because the numbers just didn't

1371
00:57:24,599 --> 00:57:28,440
make sense in the end for what we were

1372
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:31,720
trying to do whereas 99 plants it made

1373
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:33,679
it okay to do but uh very challenging

1374
00:57:31,719 --> 00:57:37,199
given the terroir and what we were

1375
00:57:33,679 --> 00:57:41,879
dealing with so um it's definitely a

1376
00:57:37,199 --> 00:57:45,000
frustration and so this is um a a direct

1377
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:46,079
threat to the traditional Market uh and

1378
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,239
some people that I know in the

1379
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:49,440
traditional Market because I know

1380
00:57:47,239 --> 00:57:51,239
somebody who purchased our farm in

1381
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:54,119
mesino county and now they're a legal

1382
00:57:51,239 --> 00:57:56,598
Market but these types of restrictions

1383
00:57:54,119 --> 00:57:58,400
will run them out of business because

1384
00:57:56,599 --> 00:58:00,838
how far off they are in the road and the

1385
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:05,079
cause will get it to get there etc etc

1386
00:58:00,838 --> 00:58:07,199
it's illogical and on top of that um

1387
00:58:05,079 --> 00:58:09,359
yeah it's just a frustration all in all

1388
00:58:07,199 --> 00:58:11,679
so I'm sorry to hear that that's also

1389
00:58:09,358 --> 00:58:13,279
happening in Maine and other states but

1390
00:58:11,679 --> 00:58:15,960
uh this is where push back needs to

1391
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:17,359
happen we are having uh challenges so

1392
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:18,960
this is why you need to show up at your

1393
00:58:17,358 --> 00:58:21,279
waterboard meetings your forestry

1394
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:23,720
meetings uh people say oh I don't want

1395
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:26,160
to get involved in politics well all

1396
00:58:23,719 --> 00:58:27,598
this is politics around you affecting

1397
00:58:26,159 --> 00:58:30,078
everything from your roads to your

1398
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:33,760
sewage to your access and your access

1399
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:36,119
point so we really have to uh you know

1400
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:39,799
always think you know globally but act

1401
00:58:36,119 --> 00:58:41,920
locally completely so you know plug in

1402
00:58:39,798 --> 00:58:44,440
um be at the table otherwise you're on

1403
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:47,400
the menu and nobody wants to be on the

1404
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:49,720
menu so show up and be at the table you

1405
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:51,720
know it's a pain in the ass that's the

1406
00:58:49,719 --> 00:58:54,399
the the price of Liberty unfortunately

1407
00:58:51,719 --> 00:58:56,318
but if you want to continue you know

1408
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:58,798
what we did in the past sitting back and

1409
00:58:56,318 --> 00:59:01,159
hiding in our shelters growing our

1410
00:58:58,798 --> 00:59:04,119
cannabis quietly no longer works for us

1411
00:59:01,159 --> 00:59:06,318
we have to actually plug in and speak up

1412
00:59:04,119 --> 00:59:10,640
on top of that we have to figure out a

1413
00:59:06,318 --> 00:59:12,558
way in California to uh raise up the

1414
00:59:10,639 --> 00:59:15,318
traditional market we've been able to do

1415
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:18,400
it with the over regulated market but we

1416
00:59:15,318 --> 00:59:20,798
need to figure out how to make the

1417
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:23,079
traditional Market safer for consumers

1418
00:59:20,798 --> 00:59:24,920
because consumers have chosen that but

1419
00:59:23,079 --> 00:59:27,160
we know the unscrupulous cannabis that

1420
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:28,960
does not make the Great

1421
00:59:27,159 --> 00:59:31,920
in the legal Market goes to the

1422
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:34,400
traditional market so uh I'm always

1423
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:36,639
fascinated from traditional marketi ists

1424
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:39,358
on the frustrations that they that I

1425
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:43,639
hear from them which is you know the

1426
00:59:39,358 --> 00:59:47,000
over uh uh salification of their plants

1427
00:59:43,639 --> 00:59:49,318
uh that they get and the the Cannabis is

1428
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:51,519
uh no longer the craft quality they used

1429
00:59:49,318 --> 00:59:53,318
to get prior it's it's kind of a

1430
00:59:51,519 --> 00:59:55,599
commercial quality that people are

1431
00:59:53,318 --> 00:59:58,159
utilizing to make money so we've got

1432
00:59:55,599 --> 01:00:00,440
this fortunate continuation of the

1433
00:59:58,159 --> 01:00:01,960
prohibition that has led to back in the

1434
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:03,358
day remember we used to import all that

1435
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:07,000
stuff from

1436
01:00:03,358 --> 01:00:09,318
Canada in those bags Etc that extra wet

1437
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:11,920
weed that we would get back in the day I

1438
01:00:09,318 --> 01:00:16,159
remember that yeah you

1439
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:20,039
knowers beers beers beers you you know

1440
01:00:16,159 --> 01:00:22,639
yeah so I mean we we all we let me just

1441
01:00:20,039 --> 01:00:25,640
defend Canada for half a

1442
01:00:22,639 --> 01:00:28,239
second because it didn't start like that

1443
01:00:25,639 --> 01:00:31,078
but I will say

1444
01:00:28,239 --> 01:00:35,078
this I met quite a few buyers over the

1445
01:00:31,079 --> 01:00:37,839
years that would tumble the

1446
01:00:35,079 --> 01:00:41,039
flowers before they brought it down to

1447
01:00:37,838 --> 01:00:44,000
sell it to their American Brethren they

1448
01:00:41,039 --> 01:00:45,880
would tumble the flowers and I'm talking

1449
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:48,719
hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of

1450
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:51,200
pounds they're pulling like so much

1451
01:00:48,719 --> 01:00:53,598
resin off that plant and then the poor

1452
01:00:51,199 --> 01:00:55,679
Canadian Growers were getting like

1453
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:58,480
burned for like oh you guys are growing

1454
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:59,759
the swag up there we call it no trikes

1455
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:02,838
it's like yeah well you should talk to

1456
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:06,559
your brother who's selling it to you

1457
01:01:02,838 --> 01:01:09,798
because that's not cool

1458
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:12,920
[ __ ] Al go ahead also an issue of

1459
01:01:09,798 --> 01:01:17,199
hydroponic growing taking off you know

1460
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:20,200
and the whole Warehouse grown hydroponic

1461
01:01:17,199 --> 01:01:22,519
blast blast off mode that happened in

1462
01:01:20,199 --> 01:01:25,038
British Columbia and then of course mies

1463
01:01:22,519 --> 01:01:27,318
that with the the syndicates that bring

1464
01:01:25,039 --> 01:01:30,280
things back and forth then you just have

1465
01:01:27,318 --> 01:01:31,719
those remnants around still today and

1466
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:33,480
when we talk about commercial weed not

1467
01:01:31,719 --> 01:01:35,719
being very good well we can talk about

1468
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:38,280
that in the same light as beaster that's

1469
01:01:35,719 --> 01:01:40,719
exactly what it was it was really sort

1470
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:44,720
of the first time that North America had

1471
01:01:40,719 --> 01:01:47,038
seen such volume of that salted

1472
01:01:44,719 --> 01:01:51,038
commercial weed and that was definitely

1473
01:01:47,039 --> 01:01:54,039
coming from you know a particular uh

1474
01:01:51,039 --> 01:01:56,680
variety of of people up here in Canada

1475
01:01:54,039 --> 01:01:58,640
but even that even that didn't start

1476
01:01:56,679 --> 01:02:00,919
like that you know cuz I remember how

1477
01:01:58,639 --> 01:02:03,199
that started and and breeder Steve was

1478
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:06,119
really one of the people who he gave

1479
01:02:03,199 --> 01:02:08,639
that cut to key people and uh they were

1480
01:02:06,119 --> 01:02:10,920
just like oh wow like we can do this

1481
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:13,679
instead of this other very dangerous

1482
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:15,798
thing and I remember back in the day

1483
01:02:13,679 --> 01:02:18,239
like when those guys first started doing

1484
01:02:15,798 --> 01:02:20,759
it it was actually it was grapefruit and

1485
01:02:18,239 --> 01:02:23,519
it was they it was unbelievable that

1486
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:25,920
people that never grew before were

1487
01:02:23,519 --> 01:02:29,318
growing like this beautiful grapefruit

1488
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:32,760
flow the problem was within about two to

1489
01:02:29,318 --> 01:02:34,558
3 years they were just like we get the

1490
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:35,920
same money we don't even have to dry it

1491
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:38,039
we don't even have to finish it it's

1492
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:39,720
like five weeks whatever and it sort of

1493
01:02:38,039 --> 01:02:41,319
turned into this sort of thing where it

1494
01:02:39,719 --> 01:02:45,078
was like that was a big part of the

1495
01:02:41,318 --> 01:02:47,519
beers at uh name as as well 100% but I

1496
01:02:45,079 --> 01:02:50,400
remember when it first started I was

1497
01:02:47,519 --> 01:02:53,559
blown away at the Quality that they were

1498
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:56,079
able to produce early very early on it

1499
01:02:53,559 --> 01:02:59,039
surprised me most people go in the other

1500
01:02:56,079 --> 01:03:01,519
Direction the cies of of British

1501
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:03,440
Columbia are one of the the homelands of

1502
01:03:01,519 --> 01:03:05,278
cannabis in all of Canada right I mean

1503
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:07,358
there's there's one of them there's

1504
01:03:05,278 --> 01:03:09,639
Vancouver and there's the islands and

1505
01:03:07,358 --> 01:03:11,798
there you know there's certain areas but

1506
01:03:09,639 --> 01:03:14,358
is a big one I I'll be honest because I

1507
01:03:11,798 --> 01:03:16,719
I I first went to the Cy almost 30 years

1508
01:03:14,358 --> 01:03:18,759
ago and they were growing and digging

1509
01:03:16,719 --> 01:03:20,719
holes on the mountain and mixing soils

1510
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:22,960
and had a deep knowledge of Organics and

1511
01:03:20,719 --> 01:03:25,838
sustainability and I'm telling you like

1512
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:28,760
some of the flower that I saw there in

1513
01:03:25,838 --> 01:03:31,880
particular one that I would love to find

1514
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:33,599
if anyone ever knew the the the

1515
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:36,480
background of this lineage it was called

1516
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:39,039
the A1 magenta and it was one of the

1517
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:41,960
most beautiful cutney grown flowers it

1518
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:43,680
turned ever so purple but very very

1519
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:45,199
light purple not that purple that you

1520
01:03:43,679 --> 01:03:48,558
look at and go that's probably not going

1521
01:03:45,199 --> 01:03:51,879
to be very strong or tasty but this

1522
01:03:48,559 --> 01:03:54,359
really nice light light almost like a

1523
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:56,240
light pink would come over this plant

1524
01:03:54,358 --> 01:03:59,000
and it was just such a

1525
01:03:56,239 --> 01:04:03,278
beautiful beautiful high I would compare

1526
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:05,760
it high wise to um ka's

1527
01:04:03,278 --> 01:04:08,679
coffee oh yeah that sort of very

1528
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:13,200
uplifting just like this is beautiful

1529
01:04:08,679 --> 01:04:16,598
stuff and that was that was probably in

1530
01:04:13,199 --> 01:04:18,838
1990 or 91 that I went there and dug

1531
01:04:16,599 --> 01:04:21,240
holes and planted those plants and and

1532
01:04:18,838 --> 01:04:23,278
helped my my friends from the Cy grow

1533
01:04:21,239 --> 01:04:26,239
one of their I me we first came to we

1534
01:04:23,278 --> 01:04:29,318
first came to the cies in '98 and our

1535
01:04:26,239 --> 01:04:31,759
mind our brain exploded we we came from

1536
01:04:29,318 --> 01:04:34,519
Oregon and Northern California and it

1537
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:38,278
was so militant and so hardcore and

1538
01:04:34,519 --> 01:04:40,358
harsh and had this like super Edge like

1539
01:04:38,278 --> 01:04:42,199
I'm from there like I I know the edge

1540
01:04:40,358 --> 01:04:43,759
it's it's fine it's a beautiful thing

1541
01:04:42,199 --> 01:04:47,278
you know but when you come up to to the

1542
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:48,839
C oh my God especially back then this

1543
01:04:47,278 --> 01:04:52,358
place is serious and then we were

1544
01:04:48,838 --> 01:04:56,558
smoking weed like in town in a store in

1545
01:04:52,358 --> 01:04:57,719
1998 smoking hash oil off of coold

1546
01:04:56,559 --> 01:05:01,960
you

1547
01:04:57,719 --> 01:05:04,679
know dude we were smoking hash oil in 98

1548
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:07,838
and then um you know those guys who do

1549
01:05:04,679 --> 01:05:09,639
you think I was talking about exactly

1550
01:05:07,838 --> 01:05:11,239
and uh you know and these families are

1551
01:05:09,639 --> 01:05:13,719
are you know what I love about this

1552
01:05:11,239 --> 01:05:15,719
region and is a kind of a potent for

1553
01:05:13,719 --> 01:05:18,038
this time of politics and everything is

1554
01:05:15,719 --> 01:05:20,318
the conscientious objectors that live in

1555
01:05:18,039 --> 01:05:23,960
this area it's important for people to

1556
01:05:20,318 --> 01:05:25,480
know the term conscientious objector and

1557
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:27,119
they were the ones that came from you

1558
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:29,960
know decided that they didn't want to go

1559
01:05:27,119 --> 01:05:32,278
to the Vietnam War and a tremendous

1560
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:35,559
amount of them came up to the cies to

1561
01:05:32,278 --> 01:05:38,599
grow ganja and they were the ones when

1562
01:05:35,559 --> 01:05:41,240
we first came here in 98 it was all the

1563
01:05:38,599 --> 01:05:43,318
the 50y olds you know now our age people

1564
01:05:41,239 --> 01:05:45,879
that were giving us all these seeds that

1565
01:05:43,318 --> 01:05:48,119
they had been breeding for 15 and 20

1566
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:50,240
years and they just sort of set us out

1567
01:05:48,119 --> 01:05:52,480
like here you go kids good luck here's

1568
01:05:50,239 --> 01:05:55,358
some good pointers and you know go for

1569
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:57,278
it so I'm going back 10 years to 88 when

1570
01:05:55,358 --> 01:05:59,719
I was sitting on the back of the steps

1571
01:05:57,278 --> 01:06:01,318
of a police station in car me smoking a

1572
01:05:59,719 --> 01:06:02,719
joint hanging out with the guys that

1573
01:06:01,318 --> 01:06:04,798
were growing all through there and

1574
01:06:02,719 --> 01:06:06,679
that's where that's where my best

1575
01:06:04,798 --> 01:06:08,038
friend's dad lived and that's where they

1576
01:06:06,679 --> 01:06:09,919
were growing that's where some of the

1577
01:06:08,039 --> 01:06:13,880
seeds that I started getting back in

1578
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:16,920
those days ' 89 991 so we have seen we

1579
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:18,519
have a lot of oh yeah common Commons

1580
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:20,559
right there just because you guys are

1581
01:06:18,519 --> 01:06:22,679
like 10 years later but we know the same

1582
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:26,640
type of that whole thing going all the

1583
01:06:22,679 --> 01:06:28,639
way up into Ashcraft under Vernon yeah

1584
01:06:26,639 --> 01:06:30,358
um a lot of fire came out of there in

1585
01:06:28,639 --> 01:06:32,078
those days a lot of genetics back then

1586
01:06:30,358 --> 01:06:33,838
created a lot of the companies out there

1587
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:38,160
today that people don't know there's a

1588
01:06:33,838 --> 01:06:40,960
lot of Hardcore lges back in those days

1589
01:06:38,159 --> 01:06:42,798
and it was the buyer again you know I

1590
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:45,400
you know Marcus just mentioned it it was

1591
01:06:42,798 --> 01:06:47,400
the buyers that were you know sifting

1592
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:50,200
out flour whatever and it was also the

1593
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:51,680
buyers that started to tell us way back

1594
01:06:50,199 --> 01:06:53,919
in the day that they didn't want it to

1595
01:06:51,679 --> 01:06:56,440
smell that they wanted it to look some

1596
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:58,599
certain way that they didn't want potent

1597
01:06:56,440 --> 01:07:00,838
and you know not potency as far as you

1598
01:06:58,599 --> 01:07:03,960
know potency of feeling but you know the

1599
01:07:00,838 --> 01:07:06,519
tpin so it was just like remember these

1600
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:09,199
t a real family vibe that turned into

1601
01:07:06,519 --> 01:07:11,639
sort of like a commercial buyer thing

1602
01:07:09,199 --> 01:07:14,038
and that's what really made those

1603
01:07:11,639 --> 01:07:17,679
awesome amazing old school varietals up

1604
01:07:14,039 --> 01:07:20,760
here in Canada turn into the beers and

1605
01:07:17,679 --> 01:07:23,199
and and that's how we got that that um

1606
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:25,000
reputation later on before the beaster

1607
01:07:23,199 --> 01:07:28,399
started was when we got here and we got

1608
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:32,079
98 so by 99 we start we got given a soil

1609
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:34,119
recipe by a local gondra grower here who

1610
01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:36,559
had just come from Victoria and lived

1611
01:07:34,119 --> 01:07:38,798
over and and worked in a a food

1612
01:07:36,559 --> 01:07:41,480
production where uh greenhouse on the on

1613
01:07:38,798 --> 01:07:44,960
the island and he came back and and the

1614
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:47,480
the soil recipe was very similar to The

1615
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:51,760
Living soil no till recipes of today

1616
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:55,119
which was pyroclastic clay um you know

1617
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:58,000
three third of compost third Pete Moss

1618
01:07:55,119 --> 01:08:00,480
was big here you know there was no cocoa

1619
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:04,400
at that time you know the oyster shells

1620
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:06,599
the glacial Rock Dust the um there was

1621
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:08,680
key components the the clay that but

1622
01:08:06,599 --> 01:08:10,880
anyway it was very similar almost almost

1623
01:08:08,679 --> 01:08:14,719
identical it sounds like what we were

1624
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:18,079
mixing in like 90 and 91 those guys have

1625
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:21,119
known for so long we've been making

1626
01:08:18,079 --> 01:08:23,559
these soils you know since that since

1627
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:25,559
then and and it's cool to everyone's oh

1628
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:27,920
theyve changed so much well I think the

1629
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:31,000
way they've changed is we add more

1630
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:32,960
actual raw materials and Haze and living

1631
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:35,520
cover crop like that part's changed like

1632
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:37,399
we didn't put living seeds and and

1633
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:40,799
living things on so it's definitely

1634
01:08:37,399 --> 01:08:42,759
hybridized nowadays but the base soil of

1635
01:08:40,798 --> 01:08:45,399
has is damn you're exactly the same and

1636
01:08:42,759 --> 01:08:47,759
I think those originally those soil

1637
01:08:45,399 --> 01:08:50,920
recipes came from Cornell University I

1638
01:08:47,759 --> 01:08:53,319
mean those those old organic so a lot of

1639
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:55,199
them you know Cornell University is is a

1640
01:08:53,319 --> 01:08:57,080
is a Homeland for that but I just also

1641
01:08:55,198 --> 01:08:58,559
like we were doing soils we were you

1642
01:08:57,079 --> 01:09:01,439
know down in Oregon and we were just

1643
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:03,400
digging holes and trying to put as much

1644
01:09:01,439 --> 01:09:05,079
stuff as we possibly could put in the

1645
01:09:03,399 --> 01:09:06,920
holes make the holes as big as you

1646
01:09:05,079 --> 01:09:09,079
possibly could because that's what we

1647
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:11,399
thought was the right thing to do so in

1648
01:09:09,079 --> 01:09:15,198
the early 90s we were growing hug hug

1649
01:09:11,399 --> 01:09:17,599
Among Us plants in sort of Virgin soil

1650
01:09:15,198 --> 01:09:20,000
that was really awesome and amazing too

1651
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:22,079
so learning about soil recipes off of

1652
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:24,000
that and like oh wow I guess that's what

1653
01:09:22,079 --> 01:09:26,640
we were doing when we were mixing them

1654
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:28,198
in these big holes and and uh you know

1655
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:30,159
even putting like some of the dead

1656
01:09:28,198 --> 01:09:32,599
animals in the bottom of the hole oh you

1657
01:09:30,158 --> 01:09:34,679
find a dead frog on the road put him in

1658
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:36,120
the bottom of the hole or dead snake or

1659
01:09:34,679 --> 01:09:37,560
something put him in the bottom of a

1660
01:09:36,119 --> 01:09:39,920
hole the rule of thumb as we were

1661
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:42,480
growing up was to like she said put you

1662
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:45,520
know a fish or some kind of actual

1663
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:47,559
living dead animal in in the hole and

1664
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:49,239
then to have fish like when I was in

1665
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:51,960
high school so this is like 80s or

1666
01:09:49,238 --> 01:09:54,678
whatever it was uh you know my I have

1667
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:55,960
close friends that were rotting fish in

1668
01:09:54,679 --> 01:09:58,520
water

1669
01:09:55,960 --> 01:10:00,399
and and it was the the the the the goal

1670
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:02,520
was to make it the most disgusting

1671
01:10:00,399 --> 01:10:05,198
smelling liquid you could possibly make

1672
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:07,600
because that's how you make stinky weed

1673
01:10:05,198 --> 01:10:10,519
yeah so like you know you get the the

1674
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:12,520
Purple Kush was very common back in the

1675
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:15,159
late 80s in southern Oregon it was

1676
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:17,239
probably the most potent good purple

1677
01:10:15,158 --> 01:10:21,000
kush that you could ever get and I just

1678
01:10:17,238 --> 01:10:23,359
remember absolutely amazing flavors on

1679
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:26,158
those on those herbs back then in seller

1680
01:10:23,359 --> 01:10:28,000
Oregon incredible just just to mention

1681
01:10:26,158 --> 01:10:30,000
how prolific and I'm sure it's as

1682
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:32,760
prolific now but how prolific it was

1683
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:35,560
just even in the early early 90s growing

1684
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:37,239
cannabis and the Cy while we were out

1685
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:40,080
there digging these holes and planting

1686
01:10:37,238 --> 01:10:43,119
these plants you know it's it's the

1687
01:10:40,079 --> 01:10:45,000
cutney a lot of it is around cotney Lake

1688
01:10:43,119 --> 01:10:47,599
and it's like this one road and so it's

1689
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:49,399
a very kind of In-N-Out sort of thing

1690
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:51,159
and so they would set up roadblocks and

1691
01:10:49,399 --> 01:10:55,399
they would actually be looking for

1692
01:10:51,158 --> 01:10:57,039
gardening equipment shovels pots uh mud

1693
01:10:55,399 --> 01:10:59,198
like and the first time I ever went

1694
01:10:57,039 --> 01:11:01,679
through one I just couldn't believe it I

1695
01:10:59,198 --> 01:11:04,439
was like are you kidding me that the

1696
01:11:01,679 --> 01:11:07,359
police are doing roadblocks just to see

1697
01:11:04,439 --> 01:11:08,919
if you guys have like shovels and pots

1698
01:11:07,359 --> 01:11:10,399
and stuff and then they just like write

1699
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:12,279
your license plate down he's like oh

1700
01:11:10,399 --> 01:11:14,158
yeah man it's like all everyone here

1701
01:11:12,279 --> 01:11:15,479
it's just like and they just they're

1702
01:11:14,158 --> 01:11:17,079
going for it they're like ah just throw

1703
01:11:15,479 --> 01:11:18,839
a tarp over that they won't be able to

1704
01:11:17,079 --> 01:11:21,479
see it it's like well what if they ask

1705
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:23,840
to lift the tarp oh whatever man we'll

1706
01:11:21,479 --> 01:11:26,439
figure it out I just loved the attitude

1707
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:29,039
back then it was uh

1708
01:11:26,439 --> 01:11:31,359
Wild Wild West we're smoking weed in

1709
01:11:29,039 --> 01:11:32,719
town you know but then now all of a

1710
01:11:31,359 --> 01:11:34,198
sudden there's a roadblock on the way

1711
01:11:32,719 --> 01:11:35,679
home you're it's like what the what are

1712
01:11:34,198 --> 01:11:38,039
we

1713
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:40,199
missing we always used to have you know

1714
01:11:38,039 --> 01:11:42,079
some wildcrafted stuff in the car and

1715
01:11:40,198 --> 01:11:44,238
just say that we were wildcrafting all

1716
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:46,119
the time you know that was just always

1717
01:11:44,238 --> 01:11:47,839
the thing always make sure you've got

1718
01:11:46,119 --> 01:11:49,319
some kind of nettle or something in the

1719
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:51,400
car that would say that you out

1720
01:11:49,319 --> 01:11:53,039
wildcrafting for your Gardens and most

1721
01:11:51,399 --> 01:11:55,119
most people didn't get in trouble back

1722
01:11:53,039 --> 01:11:57,158
then and we know at least a good amount

1723
01:11:55,119 --> 01:11:59,279
of of people that when when they did get

1724
01:11:57,158 --> 01:12:02,719
in trouble there you know they could

1725
01:11:59,279 --> 01:12:04,880
have in the past retrieved the goods

1726
01:12:02,719 --> 01:12:07,600
taken from them out of the dumpster out

1727
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:10,000
of the back of the cop shop this is true

1728
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:11,679
story I've heard the same thing to be

1729
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:13,279
honest but it's that's the thing it's

1730
01:12:11,679 --> 01:12:15,239
not like they were arresting tons of

1731
01:12:13,279 --> 01:12:17,759
people but they would go and take your

1732
01:12:15,238 --> 01:12:19,879
plants and for and for the Cy that was

1733
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:22,199
like pretty devastating to have your

1734
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:24,079
crop taken uh you know like to me like

1735
01:12:22,198 --> 01:12:26,279
all my friends in the cies were not

1736
01:12:24,079 --> 01:12:28,039
driving Ferraris uh and living in

1737
01:12:26,279 --> 01:12:29,359
mansions they all had like nice little

1738
01:12:28,039 --> 01:12:32,279
homesteads and they were all like

1739
01:12:29,359 --> 01:12:33,599
working really hard to get this crop out

1740
01:12:32,279 --> 01:12:35,519
so that they could kind of have this

1741
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:37,920
money to invest into everything they

1742
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:40,280
needed for the next year they could

1743
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:42,399
travel in the winter and their life

1744
01:12:40,279 --> 01:12:44,800
through cultures well and also you know

1745
01:12:42,399 --> 01:12:47,638
like our our patch was a seven and a

1746
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:50,560
half hour hike that was like you know a

1747
01:12:47,639 --> 01:12:52,639
really big hike so we'd have to leave

1748
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:55,880
you know at dark and if we wanted to get

1749
01:12:52,639 --> 01:12:58,159
home you know having you know some kind

1750
01:12:55,880 --> 01:13:01,000
of a farm home life with the animals and

1751
01:12:58,158 --> 01:13:04,638
stuff at home we'd have to leave at dark

1752
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:08,439
and then um you know come back at

1753
01:13:04,639 --> 01:13:11,199
dark super intense and really amazing

1754
01:13:08,439 --> 01:13:13,439
Kelly did you guys ever look at Korean

1755
01:13:11,198 --> 01:13:18,000
far natural farming early on I it was

1756
01:13:13,439 --> 01:13:20,879
one of my first foray into just getting

1757
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:25,760
out of salts and looking deeper into the

1758
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:27,159
land um you guys yeah it was just really

1759
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:30,239
inspiring because at the time there was

1760
01:13:27,158 --> 01:13:33,599
just nothing that I could read at all

1761
01:13:30,238 --> 01:13:35,198
there just was nothing um but then there

1762
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:36,520
this and there was books and I so I

1763
01:13:35,198 --> 01:13:39,519
really honed in on that I was I'm

1764
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:41,600
curious to see if you guys maybe did

1765
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:43,400
some of course of course yeah it's a

1766
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:46,440
it's a great question so when we first

1767
01:13:43,399 --> 01:13:48,439
came um when we first started growing uh

1768
01:13:46,439 --> 01:13:51,839
cannabis we learned about what was

1769
01:13:48,439 --> 01:13:54,119
called weed teas so you know you put a

1770
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:56,000
garbage can in your garden in your

1771
01:13:54,119 --> 01:13:58,158
vegetable garden and you take all of

1772
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:00,639
your weeds and you throw all of your

1773
01:13:58,158 --> 01:14:03,238
weeds into basically is a liquid

1774
01:14:00,639 --> 01:14:05,639
composter so you're throwing them into

1775
01:14:03,238 --> 01:14:07,599
water and you're liquid composting your

1776
01:14:05,639 --> 01:14:09,960
plants well then we started doing

1777
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:12,360
research on like all of the different

1778
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:14,920
cultures that do liquid composting so

1779
01:14:12,359 --> 01:14:16,559
the Japanese did Li liquid composting

1780
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:19,119
all of the Europeans did liquid

1781
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:22,080
composting we got a lot of um those weed

1782
01:14:19,119 --> 01:14:25,399
te recipes even from uh some of the

1783
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:27,119
Quakers that live in in our community in

1784
01:14:25,399 --> 01:14:29,000
this area so they would even say Hey you

1785
01:14:27,119 --> 01:14:31,679
know if you do nettle and you do some

1786
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:35,560
chickweed so we really started out our

1787
01:14:31,679 --> 01:14:38,239
growing doing sort of this liquid herbal

1788
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:42,320
uh decoction mixed with raw materials

1789
01:14:38,238 --> 01:14:44,198
going mix in with no Bashi like so

1790
01:14:42,319 --> 01:14:46,359
basically what she's saying is in 99 we

1791
01:14:44,198 --> 01:14:48,439
got here and we were following natural

1792
01:14:46,359 --> 01:14:50,639
farming Concepts without knowing the

1793
01:14:48,439 --> 01:14:53,799
word natural yeah we had already been

1794
01:14:50,639 --> 01:14:56,560
doing liquid liquid composting and using

1795
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:59,600
herbal uh decoctions and a lot of the

1796
01:14:56,560 --> 01:15:03,120
tea recipes that we do today came from

1797
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:06,440
that not necessarily from k&amp;f and then

1798
01:15:03,119 --> 01:15:10,319
later we we went to Hawaii in 2008 in

1799
01:15:06,439 --> 01:15:12,479
2008 and do Master Cho was doing a h a

1800
01:15:10,319 --> 01:15:14,639
workshop the very first workshop on the

1801
01:15:12,479 --> 01:15:17,039
big island on the big island in Hawaii

1802
01:15:14,639 --> 01:15:18,880
at that time and he was talking about oh

1803
01:15:17,039 --> 01:15:20,960
all these k&amp;f ideas and we were like

1804
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:24,079
whoa that's sort of what we're already

1805
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:26,319
doing that's really amazing and and then

1806
01:15:24,079 --> 01:15:29,639
we sort of find United some of our

1807
01:15:26,319 --> 01:15:32,000
skills with the lab adding lab to it so

1808
01:15:29,639 --> 01:15:34,679
we took some some little treasures and

1809
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:37,639
Little Gems from a lot of the old world

1810
01:15:34,679 --> 01:15:39,639
farming practices and we took some of

1811
01:15:37,639 --> 01:15:42,119
those gems from k&amp;f as well you know

1812
01:15:39,639 --> 01:15:44,000
we're not fully entrenched in k&amp;f

1813
01:15:42,119 --> 01:15:46,399
because we really want to do what's

1814
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:48,760
easiest for us what works on our farm

1815
01:15:46,399 --> 01:15:51,119
what works for what we have growing what

1816
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:53,320
type of biomass that we have growing and

1817
01:15:51,119 --> 01:15:55,439
we're really specific on what we bring

1818
01:15:53,319 --> 01:15:58,479
in we really don't bring in any anything

1819
01:15:55,439 --> 01:16:00,879
we bring in a C90 which is a 90 Trace

1820
01:15:58,479 --> 01:16:04,079
mineral onto our farm other than that

1821
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:06,600
we're 100% closed loop so a lot of the

1822
01:16:04,079 --> 01:16:09,479
k&amp;f recipes asked to bring in things

1823
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:11,440
that just wasn't conducive for us as all

1824
01:16:09,479 --> 01:16:13,439
so we just continued on with a lot of

1825
01:16:11,439 --> 01:16:15,879
the old school recipes that we had been

1826
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:17,719
doing since the beginning of our growing

1827
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:21,199
practices and then again fin nighted it

1828
01:16:17,719 --> 01:16:22,639
with knf in 2008 so like a a hybrid if

1829
01:16:21,198 --> 01:16:24,439
you will of all these different

1830
01:16:22,639 --> 01:16:26,039
ideologies and and you really kind

1831
01:16:24,439 --> 01:16:29,599
borrowed from the things that you felt

1832
01:16:26,039 --> 01:16:32,238
were important yeah great yeah because

1833
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:34,079
we we walked out seven and a half hours

1834
01:16:32,238 --> 01:16:36,479
so we really couldn't carry anything

1835
01:16:34,079 --> 01:16:38,238
with us at all so we had to really look

1836
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:40,439
at what type of herbs were out there

1837
01:16:38,238 --> 01:16:42,399
that were good for different types of

1838
01:16:40,439 --> 01:16:45,279
nutrients and different types of

1839
01:16:42,399 --> 01:16:47,519
minerals so with all of my herbology

1840
01:16:45,279 --> 01:16:50,559
background I know what has high

1841
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:53,560
magnesium what has high Cobalt what has

1842
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:56,480
you know high calcium so we just started

1843
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:59,679
you know doing tee ferments with those

1844
01:16:56,479 --> 01:17:01,638
type of herbs um in treating plants for

1845
01:16:59,679 --> 01:17:04,319
whatever malades and nutrients that they

1846
01:17:01,639 --> 01:17:06,359
needed at the time I I would just add I

1847
01:17:04,319 --> 01:17:07,679
would just add one more thing really

1848
01:17:06,359 --> 01:17:10,238
quick which

1849
01:17:07,679 --> 01:17:13,158
is so all through the 90s we're studying

1850
01:17:10,238 --> 01:17:15,238
Midwifery right we're studying plant

1851
01:17:13,158 --> 01:17:16,479
tees and naturopathic medicine for women

1852
01:17:15,238 --> 01:17:18,879
right we've already said this plenty of

1853
01:17:16,479 --> 01:17:20,678
times and locally but then we move up to

1854
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:22,560
you know this far away place we're not

1855
01:17:20,679 --> 01:17:24,520
citizens we have to survive out in the

1856
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:27,560
mountains we have to be underground no

1857
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:30,159
one can know we live here you know so we

1858
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:32,080
chose to mean take that as like oh okay

1859
01:17:30,158 --> 01:17:33,399
we're not going to the grow store so now

1860
01:17:32,079 --> 01:17:35,359
we're we're we're living on the land

1861
01:17:33,399 --> 01:17:38,039
we're going to be self-sufficient

1862
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:40,039
homesteaders we moved to one of the most

1863
01:17:38,039 --> 01:17:41,600
you know powerful places probably in all

1864
01:17:40,039 --> 01:17:43,679
of British Columbia to do that to be

1865
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:45,560
real and we have this incredible root so

1866
01:17:43,679 --> 01:17:49,039
now we're like okay we're going to grow

1867
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:51,159
gardens in this herbology Midwifery

1868
01:17:49,039 --> 01:17:53,279
style oh we're gonna do stuff like

1869
01:17:51,158 --> 01:17:55,519
biodynamics I mean good God since you

1870
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:58,880
know forever you know

1871
01:17:55,520 --> 01:18:02,239
uh uh Rudolph Steiner has M millions of

1872
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:05,159
pages on on spiritual sacred cultivation

1873
01:18:02,238 --> 01:18:08,959
our library in our community is filled

1874
01:18:05,158 --> 01:18:12,119
with books of biodynamics homesteading

1875
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:14,079
you know uh stuff from Europe stuff from

1876
01:18:12,119 --> 01:18:15,920
Asia and so we're we're we're we're

1877
01:18:14,079 --> 01:18:17,800
engulfed in this there's no internet

1878
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:20,960
there's no way of communication there's

1879
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:23,440
so that that's part of our inoculation

1880
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:26,039
let's say so then we get into this you

1881
01:18:23,439 --> 01:18:28,198
know growing the Hillside and then we

1882
01:18:26,039 --> 01:18:30,519
and then we find this Revelation you

1883
01:18:28,198 --> 01:18:32,599
know of Korean natural farming you know

1884
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:35,080
and then we put all the parts together

1885
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:37,880
and then we find oh hu hugle culture you

1886
01:18:35,079 --> 01:18:41,158
know and and so one of our biggest

1887
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:43,600
things is Unleash Your Dogma because

1888
01:18:41,158 --> 01:18:47,238
when you become a k&amp;f person you think

1889
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:49,199
that you are in the dogma of life like

1890
01:18:47,238 --> 01:18:51,359
Korean national farming has to be this

1891
01:18:49,198 --> 01:18:53,479
way or it's not actually crean natural

1892
01:18:51,359 --> 01:18:55,198
farming you know or or maybe even

1893
01:18:53,479 --> 01:18:57,799
biodynamics you know you can't be a

1894
01:18:55,198 --> 01:19:00,119
demer certified Farm unless you use

1895
01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:02,039
biodynamic preps you know I mean which

1896
01:19:00,119 --> 01:19:04,599
is then you can do all sorts of other

1897
01:19:02,039 --> 01:19:06,800
things that don't make any sense so I

1898
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:09,480
think what Josh means by unleashing your

1899
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:12,039
Dogma is just do what works for your

1900
01:19:09,479 --> 01:19:14,519
farm you know accept other people's

1901
01:19:12,039 --> 01:19:16,840
means and ways if there's you know

1902
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:19,040
natural processes that you're using it's

1903
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:20,960
awesome we say that you need closed

1904
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:24,158
loops with the demm certification well

1905
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:27,719
we hear about new closed Loops every day

1906
01:19:24,158 --> 01:19:30,399
it's so awesome the incredible

1907
01:19:27,719 --> 01:19:33,960
creativity that people come up with to

1908
01:19:30,399 --> 01:19:35,719
create natural closed Loops by utilizing

1909
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:38,000
all these different modalities of

1910
01:19:35,719 --> 01:19:39,639
ancient growing practices and now every

1911
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:42,960
year all the time it's just constantly

1912
01:19:39,639 --> 01:19:47,000
validated give thanks we love family

1913
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:48,719
question uh for dragonfly uh if if you

1914
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:51,198
were going to summarize what you're

1915
01:19:48,719 --> 01:19:54,039
doing or people who are listening what

1916
01:19:51,198 --> 01:19:57,399
they could do to optimize their soil

1917
01:19:54,039 --> 01:19:59,079
health wouldn't you say that like really

1918
01:19:57,399 --> 01:20:01,559
what we're what we're trying to do is

1919
01:19:59,079 --> 01:20:04,439
capture the biology that's already

1920
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:07,560
happening on your soil in your land

1921
01:20:04,439 --> 01:20:09,879
around you uh and taking advantage of

1922
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:12,199
the inputs that are already there and

1923
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:15,000
just recognizing them for what they are

1924
01:20:12,198 --> 01:20:19,960
and building again not so much things

1925
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:23,198
like worm castings or um any specific

1926
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:26,560
tees but it's more about the biology the

1927
01:20:23,198 --> 01:20:28,638
microbiology the micro biome if you will

1928
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:30,520
of fungus and bacteria and viruses all

1929
01:20:28,639 --> 01:20:33,159
of the various things that are happening

1930
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:35,440
that's really what we're trying to

1931
01:20:33,158 --> 01:20:40,039
enhance if you will with closed loop

1932
01:20:35,439 --> 01:20:42,319
systems would and as my teacher on this

1933
01:20:40,039 --> 01:20:44,399
kind of thing I'd love to hear your

1934
01:20:42,319 --> 01:20:47,519
thoughts

1935
01:20:44,399 --> 01:20:50,319
on one of the number one reasons to do

1936
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:52,840
Clos Loop was if it's not coming from

1937
01:20:50,319 --> 01:20:55,920
your farm where is it coming from how

1938
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:58,920
did it get there and and what what was

1939
01:20:55,920 --> 01:21:01,279
it made from you know so that that was a

1940
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:03,560
thing that said if and maybe you live on

1941
01:21:01,279 --> 01:21:05,800
a farm that doesn't have everything that

1942
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:07,480
you need on it you know so there's might

1943
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:09,800
maybe reasons that's why you want to

1944
01:21:07,479 --> 01:21:11,879
grow different plants and also for the

1945
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:14,119
success of the farmer so just to add

1946
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:17,079
real quickly when you bring on things we

1947
01:21:14,119 --> 01:21:20,920
were noticing some omry listed things

1948
01:21:17,079 --> 01:21:23,198
were were not uh were failing tests for

1949
01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:27,960
Farmers so we really wanted the ultimate

1950
01:21:23,198 --> 01:21:31,158
success for farmers go ahead and um yeah

1951
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:34,439
just the idea that it puts you in a more

1952
01:21:31,158 --> 01:21:36,039
self-reliant more powerful place like I

1953
01:21:34,439 --> 01:21:38,319
again we have to look at to where we are

1954
01:21:36,039 --> 01:21:41,039
in life right now are we reliant on the

1955
01:21:38,319 --> 01:21:43,158
system to be healthy are we reliant on

1956
01:21:41,039 --> 01:21:45,600
the system to create health and

1957
01:21:43,158 --> 01:21:48,158
well-being in our soil well we think

1958
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:50,120
it's more powerful not to well and I

1959
01:21:48,158 --> 01:21:52,759
think if you we think it's more powerful

1960
01:21:50,119 --> 01:21:54,920
to get your power from nature which has

1961
01:21:52,760 --> 01:21:57,560
survived mass extinction in the past you

1962
01:21:54,920 --> 01:22:00,520
know so we're trying to Ally with that

1963
01:21:57,560 --> 01:22:04,039
that survives you know and and

1964
01:22:00,520 --> 01:22:07,760
microbiology is what survives science is

1965
01:22:04,039 --> 01:22:09,880
is a is a Folly in in the in the in the

1966
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:11,000
in the evolution of nature you know so

1967
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:12,600
here it's very helpful with the

1968
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:14,840
evolution of nature but we're always

1969
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:17,840
proving something different with science

1970
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:19,239
it's an Ever Changing you know end line

1971
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:21,199
you know where is the endline and

1972
01:22:19,238 --> 01:22:23,439
science is always changing the end line

1973
01:22:21,198 --> 01:22:26,519
but nature never really seems to change

1974
01:22:23,439 --> 01:22:28,960
her endline her goal number one goal is

1975
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:31,159
to make soil so if we want to mimic

1976
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:33,000
nature and what her closed Loops are

1977
01:22:31,158 --> 01:22:36,638
then all of our number one goal is to

1978
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:38,520
make soil so if we want to you know

1979
01:22:36,639 --> 01:22:40,199
continue on the path of what Nature has

1980
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:42,760
shown Us in her health and well-being

1981
01:22:40,198 --> 01:22:45,319
and being able to overcome such

1982
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:47,800
incredible amounts of opposition with

1983
01:22:45,319 --> 01:22:50,599
what she's been thrown at uh by humanity

1984
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:54,079
and toxicity then we can recognize that

1985
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:55,039
nature is able to uh detoxify almost

1986
01:22:54,079 --> 01:22:59,319
every

1987
01:22:55,039 --> 01:23:01,920
so why not utilize her as as the main

1988
01:22:59,319 --> 01:23:03,880
Mentor basically and enhance the the the

1989
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:05,199
ability of your plant to evolve you know

1990
01:23:03,880 --> 01:23:07,800
I mean we're we're trying to give it

1991
01:23:05,198 --> 01:23:09,759
more microbiology so that it can enhance

1992
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:14,320
its own medicine so we feel like that's

1993
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:16,760
done through local uh raw

1994
01:23:14,319 --> 01:23:19,119
materials I came to the practices you

1995
01:23:16,760 --> 01:23:20,880
guys recommend uh through trying to make

1996
01:23:19,119 --> 01:23:24,039
the cleanest possible version of

1997
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:26,079
cannabis so that we could make medicine

1998
01:23:24,039 --> 01:23:28,719
uh and that was really what it was all

1999
01:23:26,079 --> 01:23:31,039
about for me and yeah I remember hearing

2000
01:23:28,719 --> 01:23:34,399
about I guess somebody was at the that

2001
01:23:31,039 --> 01:23:37,158
same event on the big island when and a

2002
01:23:34,399 --> 01:23:41,359
friend came back talking to me about k&amp;f

2003
01:23:37,158 --> 01:23:45,000
when I was still working indoors uh and

2004
01:23:41,359 --> 01:23:46,319
uh uh it was an exciting concept but I

2005
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:48,279
couldn't see how to make that any of

2006
01:23:46,319 --> 01:23:52,039
that work inside a warehouse in San

2007
01:23:48,279 --> 01:23:54,840
Francisco so not to be confused with

2008
01:23:52,039 --> 01:23:58,399
KFC for sure had one of those just down

2009
01:23:54,840 --> 01:24:00,159
the street from the warehouse also we we

2010
01:23:58,399 --> 01:24:02,679
there it's also important to note that

2011
01:24:00,158 --> 01:24:05,519
natural farming is not just from Korea

2012
01:24:02,679 --> 01:24:08,440
so like there's a whole natural farming

2013
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:12,239
modality from Japan you know and all of

2014
01:24:08,439 --> 01:24:16,158
the Asian countries and again all of the

2015
01:24:12,238 --> 01:24:17,238
Asian countries um but uh Em which is

2016
01:24:16,158 --> 01:24:20,559
effective

2017
01:24:17,238 --> 01:24:24,599
microorganisms has been um you know has

2018
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:25,400
lactic acid bacteria untreated uh or U

2019
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:29,440
uh

2020
01:24:25,399 --> 01:24:32,359
purple H nonsulfur bacteria pnsb and

2021
01:24:29,439 --> 01:24:34,678
yeast so em is the yeast the purple

2022
01:24:32,359 --> 01:24:36,559
non-sulfur bacteria and lactic acid

2023
01:24:34,679 --> 01:24:38,800
bacteria and you can do a million things

2024
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:42,280
that's where you learn how to make Bashi

2025
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:45,039
so you know Bashi is locking in lactic

2026
01:24:42,279 --> 01:24:47,719
acid bacteria and yeast and those most

2027
01:24:45,039 --> 01:24:51,439
vigorous fermenting microbes and locking

2028
01:24:47,719 --> 01:24:53,960
it into brand right but most of the

2029
01:24:51,439 --> 01:24:55,919
okashi originally that people would

2030
01:24:53,960 --> 01:24:58,359
cheap out and the brand would not be

2031
01:24:55,920 --> 01:25:00,158
organic because they'd be like oh the

2032
01:24:58,359 --> 01:25:03,158
microorganisms are going to change over

2033
01:25:00,158 --> 01:25:04,638
the toxicity of the plant no and then

2034
01:25:03,158 --> 01:25:07,079
also it would be like oh well we're

2035
01:25:04,639 --> 01:25:09,719
gonna we're gonna activate em or we're

2036
01:25:07,079 --> 01:25:12,600
gonna activate bokashi with

2037
01:25:09,719 --> 01:25:14,000
nonorganic molasses and then you're just

2038
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:17,119
like well that's a horrible thing right

2039
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:19,000
there because you know sugar in itself

2040
01:25:17,118 --> 01:25:21,719
when produced you know is is a terrible

2041
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:23,719
thing so you have to be careful um so

2042
01:25:21,719 --> 01:25:26,239
the you know anyway there's incredible

2043
01:25:23,719 --> 01:25:29,560
manuals of of farming modalities from

2044
01:25:26,238 --> 01:25:33,879
the Philippines from India from Thailand

2045
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:38,199
from Myanmar Pakistan all using just em

2046
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:41,079
technology um so it's Dr Chu oiga from

2047
01:25:38,198 --> 01:25:43,000
uh Japan has an incredible manuals on

2048
01:25:41,079 --> 01:25:45,800
there and um so but you know there's

2049
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:48,319
jadam the newer manuals you know using a

2050
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:50,920
lot of leaf molds and things I think

2051
01:25:48,319 --> 01:25:53,960
it's just use what you can to enhance

2052
01:25:50,920 --> 01:25:56,679
your Zone and try not to get caught up

2053
01:25:53,960 --> 01:25:58,239
in things that you don't know about and

2054
01:25:56,679 --> 01:26:01,079
a lot of these natural farming

2055
01:25:58,238 --> 01:26:04,079
techniques are really to speed up what

2056
01:26:01,079 --> 01:26:07,600
nature is already doing at a really slow

2057
01:26:04,079 --> 01:26:12,319
rate which is making a a a soil it's

2058
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:14,159
creating a wonderful microbiology medium

2059
01:26:12,319 --> 01:26:17,319
and with all of these different

2060
01:26:14,158 --> 01:26:19,479
modalities it's speeding up the process

2061
01:26:17,319 --> 01:26:21,799
so that we can farm and we can get those

2062
01:26:19,479 --> 01:26:23,919
nutrients faster it's sort of part of

2063
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:26,360
farming that you know you want to be

2064
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:29,960
added a lot of mulch rather than waiting

2065
01:26:26,359 --> 01:26:32,238
for the mulch to come by the leaves

2066
01:26:29,960 --> 01:26:35,760
falling so you know you're speeding up

2067
01:26:32,238 --> 01:26:37,959
the process of of getting rich soil and

2068
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:39,639
and and having healthier plants and hey

2069
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:41,760
Mark scalone how you doing you know

2070
01:26:39,639 --> 01:26:44,400
maybe uh you I don't know if you could

2071
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:46,159
talk about Endo fidic fungi and bacteria

2072
01:26:44,399 --> 01:26:48,319
maybe you can but you know part of

2073
01:26:46,158 --> 01:26:51,359
living soils and all this crazy Natural

2074
01:26:48,319 --> 01:26:54,960
farming and stuff is to create a healthy

2075
01:26:51,359 --> 01:26:56,960
bi Liv PL to to supposedly extractor to

2076
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:58,600
use in full but I just wonder what

2077
01:26:56,960 --> 01:27:01,679
you're up to Mark and and what's

2078
01:26:58,600 --> 01:27:03,480
happening with you well hey everybody uh

2079
01:27:01,679 --> 01:27:06,158
I I was out in the gallery last week

2080
01:27:03,479 --> 01:27:07,959
listening I was I was uh what was I

2081
01:27:06,158 --> 01:27:10,719
doing was I cleaning the

2082
01:27:07,960 --> 01:27:12,960
house I uh but I listen last week it was

2083
01:27:10,719 --> 01:27:14,639
a good episode and uh yeah for some

2084
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:16,760
reason I I didn't get the link but I got

2085
01:27:14,639 --> 01:27:19,600
it this week so hi everybody uh great to

2086
01:27:16,760 --> 01:27:23,719
see everybody um yeah you know part of

2087
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:27,480
the essential role that biology plays in

2088
01:27:23,719 --> 01:27:30,480
the soil is because um biology has

2089
01:27:27,479 --> 01:27:34,718
figured out how to fix nitrogen from the

2090
01:27:30,479 --> 01:27:38,439
air and and nitrogen is this um

2091
01:27:34,719 --> 01:27:40,480
wonderfully abundant uh gas that's in

2092
01:27:38,439 --> 01:27:42,638
the oxygen and the air or not in the

2093
01:27:40,479 --> 01:27:47,399
oxygen it's in the air we breathe it's

2094
01:27:42,639 --> 01:27:50,679
in the atmosphere I think 79% is

2095
01:27:47,399 --> 01:27:52,479
nitrogen right and it's pretty inert it

2096
01:27:50,679 --> 01:27:54,520
it's pretty what we call inert it's

2097
01:27:52,479 --> 01:27:56,519
chemically inert there are things that

2098
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:59,440
react with nitrogen but for the most

2099
01:27:56,520 --> 01:28:01,360
part bacteria have figured out how to

2100
01:27:59,439 --> 01:28:03,559
fix nitrogen and the reason why that's

2101
01:28:01,359 --> 01:28:05,399
important and they don't spend a lot of

2102
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:07,920
energy doing it that's that's the other

2103
01:28:05,399 --> 01:28:10,399
important thing so man's figured out how

2104
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:12,920
to fix nitrogen but it costs a lot of

2105
01:28:10,399 --> 01:28:15,238
petrochemical derived energy to do it

2106
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:17,760
and that's something called the the

2107
01:28:15,238 --> 01:28:20,439
habber process which was basically how

2108
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:23,679
to turn nitrogen into ammonia which

2109
01:28:20,439 --> 01:28:27,079
created liquid fertilizers that began

2110
01:28:23,679 --> 01:28:30,719
the whole you know use of chemicals to

2111
01:28:27,079 --> 01:28:34,479
fortify soil I think Josh and Kelly will

2112
01:28:30,719 --> 01:28:37,079
agree that bacteria have have long since

2113
01:28:34,479 --> 01:28:39,599
figured this out because they've been

2114
01:28:37,079 --> 01:28:41,800
playing chemistry in Mother Nature's lab

2115
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:44,639
here for billions of

2116
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:46,920
years but you know France Haber did I

2117
01:28:44,639 --> 01:28:49,440
mean it was it was important at the

2118
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:50,840
beginning of the Industrial Revolution

2119
01:28:49,439 --> 01:28:53,479
when they figured out how to fix

2120
01:28:50,840 --> 01:28:56,159
nitrogen because it really it it started

2121
01:28:53,479 --> 01:28:59,559
the whole chemical industry mostly again

2122
01:28:56,158 --> 01:29:03,399
for making liquid fertilizers because

2123
01:28:59,560 --> 01:29:04,920
you know they just hadn't figured out um

2124
01:29:03,399 --> 01:29:07,198
they hadn't figured out regenerative

2125
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:09,679
farming at the time they actually did

2126
01:29:07,198 --> 01:29:13,000
but they didn't know it right and you

2127
01:29:09,679 --> 01:29:16,039
know was funny uh Josh the the point you

2128
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:18,319
made about making stinky fish broth and

2129
01:29:16,039 --> 01:29:20,118
that's how you can grow stinky weed you

2130
01:29:18,319 --> 01:29:22,559
know for us kids who are out on Grateful

2131
01:29:20,118 --> 01:29:24,359
Dead tour during the 80s you know for a

2132
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:26,080
lot of us you know Grateful Dead tour

2133
01:29:24,359 --> 01:29:29,039
was where we went out and we bought we

2134
01:29:26,079 --> 01:29:31,198
got our stinky weed and yeah I remember

2135
01:29:29,039 --> 01:29:34,238
talking to some Growers who were like

2136
01:29:31,198 --> 01:29:36,599
man we take everything from the apple

2137
01:29:34,238 --> 01:29:39,839
orchard and we take everything from our

2138
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:43,239
garden and we just we make this compost

2139
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:46,039
of just just just the richest darkest

2140
01:29:43,238 --> 01:29:48,519
soil you could possibly imagine and in

2141
01:29:46,039 --> 01:29:49,479
that you know they created you know

2142
01:29:48,520 --> 01:29:53,880
these

2143
01:29:49,479 --> 01:29:54,718
really aromatic varieties of of of weed

2144
01:29:53,880 --> 01:29:58,159
that

2145
01:29:54,719 --> 01:30:01,800
would fill Arenas on East Coast Dead

2146
01:29:58,158 --> 01:30:04,920
tours with the smoke of noral right and

2147
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:07,960
so yeah I would also say Southern Oregon

2148
01:30:04,920 --> 01:30:10,840
just just saying

2149
01:30:07,960 --> 01:30:12,800
you Garcia well you know and and the and

2150
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:15,960
the dead were connected to Oregon

2151
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:17,840
because as you know like ramrod and

2152
01:30:15,960 --> 01:30:19,800
Sparky and most of the crew they were

2153
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:22,560
all from Oregon and key they were all

2154
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:24,560
from Oregon so the the trip Carn

2155
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:27,440
Garcia that that that's right so the

2156
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:30,679
Grateful Dead scene down in the bay and

2157
01:30:27,439 --> 01:30:33,960
and Oregon was was was was connected and

2158
01:30:30,679 --> 01:30:35,239
um yeah I mean you guys are connected

2159
01:30:33,960 --> 01:30:38,840
with mountain girl and you know Mountain

2160
01:30:35,238 --> 01:30:42,599
girl wrote one of the first uh seminal

2161
01:30:38,840 --> 01:30:44,840
textbooks on on regenerative growing and

2162
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:47,639
is is that is that right can I say that

2163
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:50,880
isn't that right it's definitely right

2164
01:30:47,639 --> 01:30:54,600
1976 the Primo plant and it's specific

2165
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:57,520
to cannabis regenerative cannabis that

2166
01:30:54,600 --> 01:30:59,880
book specific to regenerative growing

2167
01:30:57,520 --> 01:31:02,199
like there wasn't a oh yeah no her her

2168
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:04,639
father is a botanist she came from

2169
01:31:02,198 --> 01:31:07,118
growing she loves weed she's super

2170
01:31:04,639 --> 01:31:09,800
inquisitive she's an awesome person what

2171
01:31:07,118 --> 01:31:11,960
a cool time in Grateful Dead history you

2172
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:14,400
know because that's right when when when

2173
01:31:11,960 --> 01:31:17,480
Trixie and Annabelle were were were

2174
01:31:14,399 --> 01:31:20,960
young kids and and Jerry was they were

2175
01:31:17,479 --> 01:31:24,198
living in Stinson Beach and Jerry was

2176
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:27,399
in they you know she they had gone and

2177
01:31:24,198 --> 01:31:29,118
left and gone up to Oregon at that time

2178
01:31:27,399 --> 01:31:30,759
because there was so many they had got

2179
01:31:29,118 --> 01:31:32,679
you know that there was like issues in

2180
01:31:30,760 --> 01:31:34,920
California they were flee they like kind

2181
01:31:32,679 --> 01:31:37,440
of like left the California scene and

2182
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:40,000
and lived on the coast over in Port

2183
01:31:37,439 --> 01:31:41,839
Orford and lived over in the beach so a

2184
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:43,760
that was a lot of that was written while

2185
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:45,440
they were you know had kind of left they

2186
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:49,560
said left the scene or whatever and went

2187
01:31:45,439 --> 01:31:53,359
up to Oregon and things so but it's all

2188
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:55,480
it still just a wonderful time of of uh

2189
01:31:53,359 --> 01:31:57,719
all kind of things going on in the scene

2190
01:31:55,479 --> 01:31:59,839
and and you know me being a young kid

2191
01:31:57,719 --> 01:32:03,359
from from the from the East Coast I mean

2192
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:06,520
again a lot of us it was uh uh for Mo

2193
01:32:03,359 --> 01:32:09,319
many years easier to get things like

2194
01:32:06,520 --> 01:32:11,280
cocaine from New York City you know you

2195
01:32:09,319 --> 01:32:12,759
could just drive over George Washington

2196
01:32:11,279 --> 01:32:15,198
Bridge and go get a little sack of

2197
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:17,320
cocaine go back to your suburban party

2198
01:32:15,198 --> 01:32:20,000
in New York City and and the only weed

2199
01:32:17,319 --> 01:32:22,118
that you can get was this little manila

2200
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:24,439
envelope which was Chuck full of seeds

2201
01:32:22,118 --> 01:32:27,158
and stems it was just the worst

2202
01:32:24,439 --> 01:32:29,879
thing in the world but on dead tour we

2203
01:32:27,158 --> 01:32:31,319
had stinky green Bud from the from the

2204
01:32:29,880 --> 01:32:33,239
West Coast I know I've said it a bunch

2205
01:32:31,319 --> 01:32:35,319
of times on hash church but hey that's

2206
01:32:33,238 --> 01:32:38,000
where the chem dog came it's pretty cool

2207
01:32:35,319 --> 01:32:39,880
because you know I was I was slinging

2208
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:41,760
the kind bud I that's how I made my way

2209
01:32:39,880 --> 01:32:43,359
through university University of Oregon

2210
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:46,520
thank you very much for the degree

2211
01:32:43,359 --> 01:32:48,880
everybody off the kind butt um little

2212
01:32:46,520 --> 01:32:51,520
did I know that that that that kind bud

2213
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:54,679
was DJ shorts blueberry strains and that

2214
01:32:51,520 --> 01:32:57,639
was all coming from him and

2215
01:32:54,679 --> 01:33:00,440
old world genetics

2216
01:32:57,639 --> 01:33:03,480
old and and and and Marcus will tell you

2217
01:33:00,439 --> 01:33:06,599
that that easily transition from kind of

2218
01:33:03,479 --> 01:33:09,519
like the Grateful Dead scene over to

2219
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:11,360
fish fish was certainly the people who

2220
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:13,639
took the torch from the Grateful Dead

2221
01:33:11,359 --> 01:33:15,799
and carried it on because again you can

2222
01:33:13,639 --> 01:33:19,520
go on fish scene and you could get

2223
01:33:15,800 --> 01:33:21,320
really kind stinky nugs in the mid90s

2224
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:22,480
right Mark and it wasn't beaster you

2225
01:33:21,319 --> 01:33:25,238
know when you guys were talking about

2226
01:33:22,479 --> 01:33:28,158
beaster before that's funny because I

2227
01:33:25,238 --> 01:33:31,399
remember people slinging beers on fish

2228
01:33:28,158 --> 01:33:35,599
lot and be like yeah yeah yeah we let

2229
01:33:31,399 --> 01:33:37,759
you know it looked good it just didn't

2230
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:39,280
it didn't it wasn't it wasn't as good as

2231
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:41,480
as as all the other [ __ ] and that's

2232
01:33:39,279 --> 01:33:43,198
right around the time that again chem

2233
01:33:41,479 --> 01:33:45,759
dog really started taking off Sour

2234
01:33:43,198 --> 01:33:49,439
Diesel started taking off the late to

2235
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:51,199
mid 90s and then you know right around

2236
01:33:49,439 --> 01:33:54,519
that time I would say that you know

2237
01:33:51,198 --> 01:33:58,638
again is is is there again a a sort of

2238
01:33:54,520 --> 01:34:01,520
like a Next Generation that sort of took

2239
01:33:58,639 --> 01:34:04,079
really good weed and made sure that you

2240
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:05,800
know it was just distributed to the

2241
01:34:04,079 --> 01:34:09,198
masses

2242
01:34:05,800 --> 01:34:11,719
or music or things that were were

2243
01:34:09,198 --> 01:34:13,759
cultural icons that brought people in

2244
01:34:11,719 --> 01:34:15,679
and were like holy [ __ ] did you smell

2245
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:18,119
that weed that's not like the [ __ ] that

2246
01:34:15,679 --> 01:34:20,840
we get at home let's go buy some weed so

2247
01:34:18,118 --> 01:34:24,000
people would go to the shows stock up on

2248
01:34:20,840 --> 01:34:27,639
weed and go home it was a dangerous time

2249
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:30,920
I would like to say because first of all

2250
01:34:27,639 --> 01:34:33,760
great weed stinks loud and you'd go to

2251
01:34:30,920 --> 01:34:36,399
these shows in the early to mid90s on

2252
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:39,000
the East Coast the Midwest even on the

2253
01:34:36,399 --> 01:34:42,198
west coast to a degree but more so in

2254
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:43,679
places like Montana and even Spokane but

2255
01:34:42,198 --> 01:34:46,719
like on the East Coast all these

2256
01:34:43,679 --> 01:34:49,679
different shows in New York cops would

2257
01:34:46,719 --> 01:34:51,920
literally sit in buildings around the

2258
01:34:49,679 --> 01:34:54,118
parking lots with walkie-talkies and

2259
01:34:51,920 --> 01:34:56,760
then literally just H have people get

2260
01:34:54,118 --> 01:34:59,719
busted on on the lot like it was a

2261
01:34:56,760 --> 01:35:03,639
dangerous game we were playing and yet

2262
01:34:59,719 --> 01:35:05,719
you couldn't not go and play the game it

2263
01:35:03,639 --> 01:35:07,319
the the beautiful thing was in the

2264
01:35:05,719 --> 01:35:09,158
parking lot if anyone was ever

2265
01:35:07,319 --> 01:35:10,880
identified as a narc there would be

2266
01:35:09,158 --> 01:35:14,559
probably 15 people walking around the

2267
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:19,199
dude going NC n NC this guy's a n this

2268
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:22,719
guy on on fish tour it was six up six

2269
01:35:19,198 --> 01:35:24,319
six up six up meant there were cops

2270
01:35:22,719 --> 01:35:27,399
heading your way they could be

2271
01:35:24,319 --> 01:35:29,238
undercover they could be uh uniformed

2272
01:35:27,399 --> 01:35:32,238
but if you heard that six up it was like

2273
01:35:29,238 --> 01:35:34,839
a wave traveling with them as they

2274
01:35:32,238 --> 01:35:36,559
walked down shake down everything would

2275
01:35:34,840 --> 01:35:38,400
roll right up man you just watch

2276
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:41,039
everybody just pull their [ __ ] up and

2277
01:35:38,399 --> 01:35:43,759
start stepping yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

2278
01:35:41,039 --> 01:35:45,800
and serious H H how key do you think

2279
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:48,520
those years you know the Grateful Dead

2280
01:35:45,800 --> 01:35:51,440
touring years and then like Mark like

2281
01:35:48,520 --> 01:35:54,560
the years that you were on fish tour and

2282
01:35:51,439 --> 01:35:56,559
like the mid90s in in in into this next

2283
01:35:54,560 --> 01:35:59,600
millennium how important do you think

2284
01:35:56,560 --> 01:36:03,360
that those years were in the

2285
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:07,039
proliferation of really good herb out to

2286
01:36:03,359 --> 01:36:09,079
the masses of people right think it was

2287
01:36:07,039 --> 01:36:12,679
important right along with psychedelic

2288
01:36:09,079 --> 01:36:15,760
mushrooms and LSD gota add I used to

2289
01:36:12,679 --> 01:36:18,920
walk around fish lot uh late 90s with

2290
01:36:15,760 --> 01:36:20,880
overgrow flyers and hand them out to get

2291
01:36:18,920 --> 01:36:24,199
people stoked on going and learning

2292
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:27,920
about growing I was that

2293

things scoo actually sent me a flyer

2298
01:36:35,639 --> 01:36:40,639

TR Dr Mark I would say for sure back in

2330
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:54,880
the day like when I was in West Virginia

2331
01:37:51,639 --> 01:37:57,039
all we would get is pressed Mexican

2332
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:58,920
cocacola so when we heard about good

2333
01:37:57,039 --> 01:38:01,920
weed we heard the dead would come

2334
01:37:58,920 --> 01:38:04,840
through my ass would go up to Pittsburgh

2335
01:38:01,920 --> 01:38:06,440
and just roll through Shakedown Street

2336
01:38:04,840 --> 01:38:08,000

2340
01:38:13,039 --> 01:38:17,719
once I got turned onto that weed and

2341
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:19,520
then then we were back back when I

2342
01:38:17,719 --> 01:38:21,118
finally you didn't stay for the show you

2343
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:23,080
turned around and went home right you

2344

2349
01:38:32,439 --> 01:38:36,598
was a sharp skin heads against racial

2350
01:38:34,039 --> 01:38:38,439
Prejudice so we beat up Nazis but you

2351

2353
01:38:40,238 --> 01:38:44,039
the military I'm in the National Guard

2354
01:38:42,198 --> 01:38:46,039
but I need some weed because I'm a

2355
01:38:44,039 --> 01:38:47,118
patient now but you can't really talk

2356
01:38:46,039 --> 01:38:48,840
about that because there's so much

2357
01:38:47,118 --> 01:38:52,118
[ __ ] music and people are like

2358
01:38:48,840 --> 01:38:54,480
shrooms shrooms weed bud bud bud so you

2359
01:38:52,118 --> 01:38:57,759
know you gotta it's it's so tricky back

2360
01:38:54,479 --> 01:38:59,198
then but when we got to California and

2361
01:38:57,760 --> 01:39:01,039
then of course we're here at the Dead

2362
01:38:59,198 --> 01:39:02,960
shows when I was with the Cannabis

2363
01:39:01,039 --> 01:39:05,880
Action Network they would let us set up

2364
01:39:02,960 --> 01:39:07,480
legally on Shakedown Street right and

2365
01:39:05,880 --> 01:39:09,599
then they would let us go inside and

2366
01:39:07,479 --> 01:39:12,000
gather signatures and that's how I met

2367
01:39:09,599 --> 01:39:13,800
bear and everybody else but even still

2368
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:15,238
back then when I was with K and I was

2369
01:39:13,800 --> 01:39:16,840
bald behind the thing they'd be like you

2370
01:39:15,238 --> 01:39:19,399
sure you're not a cop like I'm on

2371
01:39:16,840 --> 01:39:21,840
Shakedown you there 30 people around me

2372
01:39:19,399 --> 01:39:23,238
yelling narc right now and people they

2373
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:25,000
look around and people like yeah yeah

2374
01:39:23,238 --> 01:39:26,598
yeah oh yeah we would [ __ ] that that's

2375
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:29,679
that's how Justice goes here he'd be

2376
01:39:26,599 --> 01:39:32,800
[ __ ] shun the [ __ ] off but look

2377
01:39:29,679 --> 01:39:34,560
seriously not been for at the dead lot

2378
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:36,440
and and and going around and traveling

2379
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:39,080
around I do not think we would see the

2380
01:39:36,439 --> 01:39:41,079
proliferation of cannabis and the high

2381
01:39:39,079 --> 01:39:43,198
quality of cannabis in the time that we

2382
01:39:41,079 --> 01:39:44,840
did because there was no understanding

2383
01:39:43,198 --> 01:39:46,479
that that quality was there and once I

2384
01:39:44,840 --> 01:39:48,560
had tried it from somebody who had a

2385
01:39:46,479 --> 01:39:50,079
dead lot when I was in [ __ ] West

2386
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:51,520
Virginia I was like I got to go to a

2387
01:39:50,079 --> 01:39:53,960
[ __ ] dead show and get some [ __ ]

2388
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:55,599
weed because that's where real weed is

2389
01:39:53,960 --> 01:39:57,039
because whatever I'm getting and selling

2390
01:39:55,599 --> 01:40:00,360
isn't real [ __ ]

2391
01:39:57,039 --> 01:40:03,560
weed that's just how you're a Baldhead

2392
01:40:00,359 --> 01:40:05,839
dread yes yes totally bald dread yes

2393
01:40:03,560 --> 01:40:08,199
that's what it called me yes so many

2394
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:09,920
times I would go out onto dead tour with

2395
01:40:08,198 --> 01:40:12,319
with you know beautiful kind bud and

2396
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:15,480
people didn't even know that it was weed

2397
01:40:12,319 --> 01:40:18,158
no joke way back in you know like the

2398
01:40:15,479 --> 01:40:19,439
early early 90s late 80s I'd have a nice

2399
01:40:18,158 --> 01:40:20,719
stack of weed and people would be like

2400
01:40:19,439 --> 01:40:22,638
that's not weed what are you trying to

2401
01:40:20,719 --> 01:40:25,399
sell me what is that be like no it's

2402
01:40:22,639 --> 01:40:27,159
it's kind bud this is really weed they

2403
01:40:25,399 --> 01:40:28,960
didn't even really know what it was or

2404
01:40:27,158 --> 01:40:31,279
yeah the first time that people had ever

2405
01:40:28,960 --> 01:40:33,319
seen Keef or just when you're just

2406
01:40:31,279 --> 01:40:35,679
separating so you know before there was

2407
01:40:33,319 --> 01:40:38,479
bubble you know there was Keef and

2408
01:40:35,679 --> 01:40:40,599
people were using Keef and at dead tour

2409
01:40:38,479 --> 01:40:44,000
you would get these little teeny tiny

2410
01:40:40,599 --> 01:40:46,599
gorgeous pressed blocks tiny little

2411
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:48,960
pressed blocks of Kei that was so

2412
01:40:46,599 --> 01:40:51,199
exciting you know to to be able to smoke

2413
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:54,158
that and feel that high I remember that

2414
01:40:51,198 --> 01:40:56,839
well I had I actually when I got busted

2415
01:40:54,158 --> 01:40:59,719
back in the late 90s with many pounds of

2416
01:40:56,840 --> 01:41:03,159
cannabis I Had a Little Rock of

2417
01:40:59,719 --> 01:41:05,399
beautiful ke that was just like clean ke

2418
01:41:03,158 --> 01:41:06,920
that was like rocked up and uh they

2419
01:41:05,399 --> 01:41:08,399
thought it was crack cocaine they tested

2420
01:41:06,920 --> 01:41:10,800
it until it was gone and then I couldn't

2421
01:41:08,399 --> 01:41:12,359
get charged for that particular batch

2422
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:14,239
but it reminds me what you just said of

2423
01:41:12,359 --> 01:41:17,519
when I first started posting on overgrow

2424
01:41:14,238 --> 01:41:19,439
in 1999 bubble has and people would be

2425
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:21,159
like that looks like Mr whippy Mouse

2426
01:41:19,439 --> 01:41:23,439
[ __ ] like there's no way that that's

2427
01:41:21,158 --> 01:41:24,960
hash like they just people didn't know

2428
01:41:23,439 --> 01:41:26,759
and when I put it in their pipes and it

2429
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:29,079
would bubble and boil and melt into a

2430
01:41:26,760 --> 01:41:31,760
liquid they would just be like what the

2431
01:41:29,079 --> 01:41:33,039
[ __ ] is that like is that some like that

2432
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:35,239
I don't think that was hash that that

2433
01:41:33,039 --> 01:41:38,238
guy smoked with us plus back then

2434
01:41:35,238 --> 01:41:40,439
because it was so unknown it used to and

2435
01:41:38,238 --> 01:41:42,238
maybe Sam could agree with me I don't

2436
01:41:40,439 --> 01:41:46,198
see people getting knocked out the way I

2437
01:41:42,238 --> 01:41:47,879
used to people used to fall like flies

2438
01:41:46,198 --> 01:41:50,279
when they smoked bubble for the first

2439
01:41:47,880 --> 01:41:52,400
time and I'm sure Sam has stories of of

2440
01:41:50,279 --> 01:41:56,319
his dry sift way before bubble was even

2441
01:41:52,399 --> 01:42:00,279
a glimmer uh in in the eye yeah but to

2442
01:41:56,319 --> 01:42:04,880
tell you the truth even cannabis back in

2443
01:42:00,279 --> 01:42:08,238
those days uh I mean I saw people smoke

2444
01:42:04,880 --> 01:42:10,840
original Haze in the early 70s and they

2445
01:42:08,238 --> 01:42:15,479
would turn white and pass out or throw

2446
01:42:10,840 --> 01:42:18,760
up so I mean it's just the relative if

2447
01:42:15,479 --> 01:42:21,198
you're used to smoking you know 10% and

2448
01:42:18,760 --> 01:42:28,920
all of a sudden you hit something that's

2449
01:42:21,198 --> 01:42:31,759
you know 50 60 70 80 uh yeah it it is

2450
01:42:28,920 --> 01:42:35,760
you you'll turn white you'll turn pale

2451
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:38,199
your your heart I mean you know you've

2452
01:42:35,760 --> 01:42:40,400
seen it happen a million times well not

2453
01:42:38,198 --> 01:42:41,839
only that you also had the huge

2454
01:42:40,399 --> 01:42:43,519
proliferation because people weren't

2455
01:42:41,840 --> 01:42:46,400
just going to smoke this amazing weed

2456
01:42:43,520 --> 01:42:48,360
and hash just out of anything this is

2457
01:42:46,399 --> 01:42:50,000
when the Snodgrass and everything

2458
01:42:48,359 --> 01:42:53,399
started to appear I mean Johnny B is

2459
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:55,920
showing his huge chalice over here I

2460
01:42:53,399 --> 01:42:57,960
mean this was a huge proliferation I

2461
01:42:55,920 --> 01:43:00,639
mean if it wasn't for the dead lot and

2462
01:42:57,960 --> 01:43:04,079
the turning on the fish scene I mean how

2463
01:43:00,639 --> 01:43:05,639
would the glass you know whole art thing

2464
01:43:04,079 --> 01:43:08,399
that is taken off that is a whole

2465
01:43:05,639 --> 01:43:10,520
underground art movement here in America

2466
01:43:08,399 --> 01:43:13,319
I mean it would have never taken hold I

2467
01:43:10,520 --> 01:43:15,119
mean snot grass was the one I mean guys

2468
01:43:13,319 --> 01:43:17,719
would always whip out and say this is a

2469
01:43:15,118 --> 01:43:20,359
snotty this pipe cost thousand two

2470

like Johnny B Johnny V and it just felt

2504
01:44:40,319 --> 01:44:45,799
so amazing and at that time when where I

2505
01:44:43,039 --> 01:44:47,840
was I was in Mexico I mar mar orenda and

2506
01:44:45,800 --> 01:44:50,119
I actually picked up this pipe that was

2507
01:44:47,840 --> 01:44:52,119
blown at a fish concert by Slinger and

2508
01:44:50,118 --> 01:44:53,598
got his hat on here and stuff like that

2509
01:44:52,118 --> 01:44:55,319
and I brought it home because it was a

2510
01:44:53,599 --> 01:44:57,440
memory that had to come back to Canada

2511
01:44:55,319 --> 01:44:59,519
way I looked at it so it's just pretty

2512
01:44:57,439 --> 01:45:01,000
cool to show that pipe a little bit I

2513
01:44:59,520 --> 01:45:03,520
was going to comment on your hat the

2514
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:06,960
Slinger hat caught me in the immed this

2515
01:45:03,520 --> 01:45:09,800
was made at at a Grateful Dead concert

2516
01:45:06,960 --> 01:45:12,198
this is uh from what I understand um

2517
01:45:09,800 --> 01:45:13,599
this is this is a sling this is a collab

2518
01:45:12,198 --> 01:45:15,839
this is because someone's torches were

2519
01:45:13,599 --> 01:45:17,199
stolen or something no yeah oh right

2520
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:18,800
right right yeah let me think about that

2521
01:45:17,198 --> 01:45:20,439
we got to get SL we got to get Slinger

2522
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:22,119
and some of the glass community on here

2523
01:45:20,439 --> 01:45:24,598
one day as well someone mentioned it in

2524
01:45:22,118 --> 01:45:27,319
the chat so this is this is some epic

2525
01:45:24,599 --> 01:45:29,520
piece that I I know a little about but

2526
01:45:27,319 --> 01:45:31,920
not too much but I know Dave knows a lot

2527
01:45:29,520 --> 01:45:33,760
about it so does uh Ro high integrity

2528
01:45:31,920 --> 01:45:36,359
and they told me some cool stuff about

2529
01:45:33,760 --> 01:45:37,800
it they're like this is a classic so I'm

2530
01:45:36,359 --> 01:45:39,439
about ready to smoke some bubble out of

2531
01:45:37,800 --> 01:45:42,320
this thing for the first time ever with

2532
01:45:39,439 --> 01:45:45,238
you guys I remember when Jason Lee

2533
01:45:42,319 --> 01:45:47,479
figured out that particular Weld and

2534
01:45:45,238 --> 01:45:49,238
showed Slinger and I remember when they

2535
01:45:47,479 --> 01:45:52,198
all started doing it it was during

2536
01:45:49,238 --> 01:45:54,118
overgrow days actually and they would do

2537
01:45:52,198 --> 01:45:55,678
um first they did the double bubbler

2538
01:45:54,118 --> 01:45:58,238
then they did the triple then they did

2539
01:45:55,679 --> 01:46:00,158
the quad then they did this the the five

2540
01:45:58,238 --> 01:46:02,559
and then they did the sex Tupper and I I

2541
01:46:00,158 --> 01:46:04,960
bought them all I had the sex Tupper I

2542
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:08,520
ended up selling that

2543
01:46:04,960 --> 01:46:10,719
to a drum from Amsterdam ended up fixing

2544
01:46:08,520 --> 01:46:12,560
it one day because it got broken there

2545
01:46:10,719 --> 01:46:14,399
and he did a pretty good job fixing it

2546
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:17,280
but instead of cleaning it he just

2547
01:46:14,399 --> 01:46:20,960
heated it up while it was all still

2548
01:46:17,279 --> 01:46:22,479
dirty and so it fumed the the gold clear

2549
01:46:20,960 --> 01:46:25,079
glass so it was almost like this

2550
01:46:22,479 --> 01:46:27,799
metallic black looked pretty cool I

2551
01:46:25,079 --> 01:46:29,920
think I think maybe like s or Gypsy

2552
01:46:27,800 --> 01:46:32,400
Nirvana or some one of those characters

2553
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:34,399
ended up with that piece but uh I know

2554
01:46:32,399 --> 01:46:35,960
there's S Class blowers on this one

2555
01:46:34,399 --> 01:46:38,399
because this is a certain blower that's

2556
01:46:35,960 --> 01:46:40,439

like Slinger that's a uranium marble I

2561
01:46:47,560 --> 01:46:50,840
like a some kind of a tool that's I

2562
01:46:49,439 --> 01:46:53,960

I'm I'm puffing on this is the medic

2716
01:53:31,840 --> 01:53:36,880
cush that I did the fresh frozen from

2717
01:53:33,760 --> 01:53:39,520
from my last grow and with this one I

2718
01:53:36,880 --> 01:53:42,840
put it in the freeze dryer and it was

2719
01:53:39,520 --> 01:53:45,239
all so this is the 7390 n120 I was going

2720
01:53:42,840 --> 01:53:50,639
to press it but it melts so I'm not

2721
01:53:45,238 --> 01:53:54,000
pressing it so I me smoking it so longer

2722
01:53:50,639 --> 01:53:54,000
next up

2723
01:53:54,118 --> 01:53:59,960
just so oh go ahead go no go

2724
01:53:57,158 --> 01:54:02,879
Mark just so happens fellas I'm I got

2725
01:53:59,960 --> 01:54:05,719
some a little bit of uh has Church flour

2726
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:08,400
rosin it's all buttered up

2727
01:54:05,719 --> 01:54:10,158
nice just a tiny little bit I press the

2728
01:54:08,399 --> 01:54:12,238
morning it butter go up pretty much

2729
01:54:10,158 --> 01:54:16,000
instantly mine did the same thing and

2730
01:54:12,238 --> 01:54:19,879
looked the exact same color super light

2731
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:22,479
yeah and just to clarify uh atan there

2732
01:54:19,880 --> 01:54:25,719
earlier you asked me about the yield on

2733
01:54:22,479 --> 01:54:28,959
and I kind of [ __ ] that up um it I'm

2734
01:54:25,719 --> 01:54:32,039
getting about in a 4x4 area whether it's

2735
01:54:28,960 --> 01:54:35,800
a single plant or four plants I'm

2736
01:54:32,039 --> 01:54:37,599
getting about just under a pound so not

2737
01:54:35,800 --> 01:54:40,639
too bad but not the

2738
01:54:37,599 --> 01:54:43,039
best no no that's that's still solid for

2739
01:54:40,639 --> 01:54:47,520
what you're getting re reaping in trikes

2740
01:54:43,039 --> 01:54:50,479
you know I got starg here I guess my

2741
01:54:47,520 --> 01:54:52,440
background is just unbelievable starg

2742
01:54:50,479 --> 01:54:54,879
and garlic and then I also have a little

2743
01:54:52,439 --> 01:54:58,638
lemon cake here um

2744
01:54:54,880 --> 01:55:01,639
90120 and then I also have uh some 73

2745
01:54:58,639 --> 01:55:03,359
right here so I was I was interest

2746
01:55:01,639 --> 01:55:06,760
interested because I was listening last

2747
01:55:03,359 --> 01:55:08,880
week and you guys were talking about the

2748
01:55:06,760 --> 01:55:10,760
hash Church strain and that's that's

2749
01:55:08,880 --> 01:55:13,039
really cool that there's actually one

2750
01:55:10,760 --> 01:55:15,520
that exists so as you know what makes

2751
01:55:13,039 --> 01:55:17,479
these you know strain I don't like using

2752
01:55:15,520 --> 01:55:20,840
the word strain variety cult ofir

2753
01:55:17,479 --> 01:55:23,158
whatever K ofar what makes these things

2754
01:55:20,840 --> 01:55:26,599
unique are the

2755
01:55:23,158 --> 01:55:28,598
uh you know phytochemical profile so

2756
01:55:26,599 --> 01:55:30,920
what what's the what's the cannaboid

2757
01:55:28,599 --> 01:55:35,319
profile and the turine profile in this

2758
01:55:30,920 --> 01:55:38,279
in this new variety here do we

2759
01:55:35,319 --> 01:55:41,679
know uh so what what I've had tested so

2760
01:55:38,279 --> 01:55:43,519
far and it's been at a fairly small lab

2761
01:55:41,679 --> 01:55:46,000
so it's not a commercialized lab by any

2762
01:55:43,520 --> 01:55:48,599
means they do have good equipment but

2763
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:53,039
what I've gotten so far is just the THC

2764
01:55:48,599 --> 01:55:56,000
test back and it come back at 26

2765
01:55:53,039 --> 01:55:58,880
3% um I'm just waiting on the T beIN to

2766
01:55:56,000 --> 01:56:02,840
come back at this point right so that's

2767
01:55:58,880 --> 01:56:06,440
the only uh canono that is uh is shows

2768
01:56:02,840 --> 01:56:09,639
up in the canono profile of the of the

2769
01:56:06,439 --> 01:56:12,198
of the of the biom of of the plant

2770
01:56:09,639 --> 01:56:14,118
material well I actually had it tested

2771
01:56:12,198 --> 01:56:15,439
through a friend of mine and that's

2772
01:56:14,118 --> 01:56:17,639
pretty much the only thing that they've

2773
01:56:15,439 --> 01:56:20,359
given me so far I'm they're supposed to

2774
01:56:17,639 --> 01:56:23,800
be doing a pro a full profile of tpin on

2775
01:56:20,359 --> 01:56:23,799
it here shortly

2776
01:56:25,599 --> 01:56:30,960
yeah typically they'll do a profile of

2777
01:56:27,479 --> 01:56:33,000
at least no less than seven of the major

2778
01:56:30,960 --> 01:56:36,319
canabo you know because they all have

2779
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:38,800
hopefully standards in their hlc to tell

2780
01:56:36,319 --> 01:56:41,279
you what the minor profile and yeah

2781
01:56:38,800 --> 01:56:43,400
you'd expect because it's a a strain

2782
01:56:41,279 --> 01:56:46,359
that gets you high you kind of know it's

2783
01:56:43,399 --> 01:56:48,799
it's got THC in it so what makes it

2784
01:56:46,359 --> 01:56:51,279
unique are all the other minor

2785
01:56:48,800 --> 01:56:54,560
cannabinoids that are around the THC not

2786
01:56:51,279 --> 01:56:56,039
necessarily the th see I I think what's

2787
01:56:54,560 --> 01:56:58,159
even more important I couldn't agree

2788
01:56:56,039 --> 01:57:03,000
more is the

2789
01:56:58,158 --> 01:57:05,359
Tes yeah well T tpin to yeah the entire

2790
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:07,920
phytochemical profile which includes the

2791
01:57:05,359 --> 01:57:11,799
tpin but most when you look at most

2792
01:57:07,920 --> 01:57:14,359
smoking marijuana it's but basically

2793
01:57:11,800 --> 01:57:18,159
just THC with little or none of the

2794
01:57:14,359 --> 01:57:21,359
minor Turpin or canab excuse me that's

2795
01:57:18,158 --> 01:57:24,238
not true at all that's not that's that's

2796
01:57:21,359 --> 01:57:27,000
not that you're not looking at data on

2797
01:57:24,238 --> 01:57:29,238
of uh commercial cannabis and that's

2798
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:32,198
just not true at all there's a whole

2799
01:57:29,238 --> 01:57:36,799
bunch of the minor uh canono that are in

2800
01:57:32,198 --> 01:57:40,960
there as much as a a fraction uh to uh a

2801
01:57:36,800 --> 01:57:42,480
single digit percent of of CBC CBG

2802
01:57:40,960 --> 01:57:47,279
there's varieties that are out there

2803
01:57:42,479 --> 01:57:50,279
that are uh 2:1 6:1 7:1 CBD I mean CBD

2804
01:57:47,279 --> 01:57:52,439
is all throughout the Commerce chain now

2805
01:57:50,279 --> 01:57:56,399
most of those wer

2806
01:57:52,439 --> 01:58:00,559
most of those weren't bred for for to be

2807
01:57:56,399 --> 01:58:02,960
smoking marijuana they they were they're

2808
01:58:00,560 --> 01:58:05,400
a newer variety with medical because

2809
01:58:02,960 --> 01:58:08,439
when you look at the traditional

2810
01:58:05,399 --> 01:58:12,158
analysis it's really just

2811
01:58:08,439 --> 01:58:15,759
THC uh with little of the other canids

2812
01:58:12,158 --> 01:58:19,399
until indica or WID Leaf started being

2813
01:58:15,760 --> 01:58:23,679
used because it had a lot of the minor

2814
01:58:19,399 --> 01:58:26,198
canono but ganja K stick columia and

2815
01:58:23,679 --> 01:58:29,239
stuff like that was really just T mostly

2816
01:58:26,198 --> 01:58:31,118
THC a little bit of other

2817
01:58:29,238 --> 01:58:33,799
things yeah well it depends what you

2818
01:58:31,118 --> 01:58:36,359
mean by a little bit so today's hlc

2819
01:58:33,800 --> 01:58:38,279
methods pick up what that little bit is

2820
01:58:36,359 --> 01:58:42,118
and what that little bit ends up being

2821
01:58:38,279 --> 01:58:44,960
you know a few percent and a few

2822
01:58:42,118 --> 01:58:47,000
percent AR made about looking at the

2823
01:58:44,960 --> 01:58:49,560
picture of the Mona Lisa from across the

2824
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:52,238
street you kind of know there's THC in

2825
01:58:49,560 --> 01:58:54,000
there right so forget about the woman in

2826
01:58:52,238 --> 01:58:56,559
the picture look at everything else and

2827
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:59,679
everything else is yes the turpine

2828
01:58:56,560 --> 01:59:02,320
profile the canono profile we know these

2829
01:58:59,679 --> 01:59:05,078
things are monsters that create a lot of

2830
01:59:02,319 --> 01:59:08,319
THC you kind of got to look beyond the

2831
01:59:05,078 --> 01:59:10,679
THC to really find the real unique right

2832
01:59:08,319 --> 01:59:13,960
but also you got to remember something

2833
01:59:10,679 --> 01:59:17,840
else Mark the other canono don't get too

2834
01:59:13,960 --> 01:59:21,599
high and they have very

2835
01:59:17,840 --> 01:59:23,560
minor yeah but they have this you know

2836
01:59:21,599 --> 01:59:28,199
ENT or what what do we call it on this

2837
01:59:23,560 --> 01:59:28,199
show Ensemble effect Ensemble

2838
01:59:30,439 --> 01:59:35,598
effect way way more well I I tell you

2839
01:59:33,399 --> 01:59:36,960
what though I mean I I hear this more

2840
01:59:35,599 --> 01:59:39,319
and more and again because I've been

2841
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:43,078
doing lots of work in the hemp space

2842
01:59:39,319 --> 01:59:46,799
There's real a real thing when it comes

2843
01:59:43,078 --> 01:59:49,679
to that minor cannaboid profile that's

2844
01:59:46,800 --> 01:59:54,000
in full spectrum oils that just aren't

2845
01:59:49,679 --> 01:59:56,520
in isolates and I I've seen it I I've

2846
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:59,118
gotten witness testim not uh witness

2847
01:59:56,520 --> 02:00:02,119
testimony feedback on products where

2848
01:59:59,118 --> 02:00:05,319
they're like oh yeah this is it it's all

2849
02:00:02,118 --> 02:00:08,799
about there is some full spectrum

2850
02:00:05,319 --> 02:00:11,238
biological efficacy and that's why I ask

2851
02:00:08,800 --> 02:00:12,840
about the minor canabo profile because I

2852
02:00:11,238 --> 02:00:16,039
think there is something about the minor

2853
02:00:12,840 --> 02:00:18,599
canabo profile that drives that full

2854
02:00:16,039 --> 02:00:20,560
spectrum you're you're both right you're

2855
02:00:18,599 --> 02:00:22,279
just talking about different things of

2856
02:00:20,560 --> 02:00:24,520
course what you're saying mark is

2857
02:00:22,279 --> 02:00:27,039
totally true and Sam himself is one of

2858
02:00:24,520 --> 02:00:29,119
the people who started that discussion

2859
02:00:27,039 --> 02:00:30,158
in early 2000 when he had all the

2860
02:00:29,118 --> 02:00:33,880
variety

2861
02:00:30,158 --> 02:00:35,479
ofy definitely you were you were no

2862
02:00:33,880 --> 02:00:37,239
doubt about it yet I also see where

2863
02:00:35,479 --> 02:00:40,039
Sam's coming from where he's looking

2864
02:00:37,238 --> 02:00:42,238
about he's looking about getting high

2865
02:00:40,039 --> 02:00:44,560
he's just looking for that rip that gets

2866
02:00:42,238 --> 02:00:47,839
him high and when he says those other

2867
02:00:44,560 --> 02:00:51,079
minor canabo they don't do anything for

2868
02:00:47,840 --> 02:00:52,520
for that particular thing in him you

2869
02:00:51,078 --> 02:00:54,559
know but that's not to say that a full

2870
02:00:52,520 --> 02:00:57,800
spectrum oil is not going to be more

2871
02:00:54,560 --> 02:01:00,599
appreciated uh from a medical patient

2872
02:00:57,800 --> 02:01:03,320
suffering from some sensitive disorder

2873
02:01:00,599 --> 02:01:05,679
and I can appreciate that really easily

2874
02:01:03,319 --> 02:01:07,799
that medical people have different

2875
02:01:05,679 --> 02:01:11,960
priorities and different needs and

2876
02:01:07,800 --> 02:01:14,039
different yeah I totally understand that

2877
02:01:11,960 --> 02:01:16,679
I think almost I almost think of it like

2878
02:01:14,039 --> 02:01:19,319
like like almost like a volume like a

2879
02:01:16,679 --> 02:01:22,078
volume issue and that people who listen

2880
02:01:19,319 --> 02:01:25,078
to music at a lower volume than you you

2881
02:01:22,078 --> 02:01:27,559
do Sam those minor things make make a

2882
02:01:25,078 --> 02:01:30,039
difference and so people who use less

2883
02:01:27,560 --> 02:01:32,840
THC who have like a lower tolerance than

2884
02:01:30,039 --> 02:01:34,639
say like heavy users than us you know

2885
02:01:32,840 --> 02:01:36,920
people who use a lot maybe that doesn't

2886
02:01:34,639 --> 02:01:39,880
really impact but people who are lighter

2887
02:01:36,920 --> 02:01:41,118
users I think that minor canono profile

2888
02:01:39,880 --> 02:01:44,560
and that full

2889
02:01:41,118 --> 02:01:47,639
spectrum uh uh bioefficacy is a is a

2890
02:01:44,560 --> 02:01:51,079
real thing I will also add that in

2891
02:01:47,639 --> 02:01:54,400
Canada I've seen a so many coas I can't

2892
02:01:51,078 --> 02:01:57,920
even explain how many COA I've seen and

2893
02:01:54,399 --> 02:02:00,439
they are very often not ripe with minor

2894
02:01:57,920 --> 02:02:03,039
canabo it seems to be more often than

2895
02:02:00,439 --> 02:02:04,919
not it's a decent tarpine profile and

2896
02:02:03,039 --> 02:02:07,719
then it's going to be THC somewhere

2897
02:02:04,920 --> 02:02:10,078
between you know 12 and and 28% or

2898
02:02:07,719 --> 02:02:14,679
something like that and this

2899
02:02:10,078 --> 02:02:17,880
is what right here on your test results

2900
02:02:14,679 --> 02:02:19,800
on biomass on plant material yeah of

2901
02:02:17,880 --> 02:02:22,520
course we can't process anything until

2902
02:02:19,800 --> 02:02:25,159
we see um so what you just talking about

2903
02:02:22,520 --> 02:02:26,840
on sorry talk about these these

2904
02:02:25,158 --> 02:02:28,960
different you're talking about canono so

2905
02:02:26,840 --> 02:02:31,199
here here's here's something that's 20

2906
02:02:28,960 --> 02:02:33,039
40 milligrams now these don't do

2907
02:02:31,198 --> 02:02:34,479
anything to me I take a I took a couple

2908
02:02:33,039 --> 02:02:36,479
of them last week I got a little bit of

2909
02:02:34,479 --> 02:02:38,238
anxiety from it but most people these

2910
02:02:36,479 --> 02:02:41,078
are flooring them someone like salmon

2911
02:02:38,238 --> 02:02:43,118
myself I I like I I was talking about

2912
02:02:41,078 --> 02:02:44,399
this I think the CBD is blocking those

2913
02:02:43,118 --> 02:02:47,238
those different and those different

2914
02:02:44,399 --> 02:02:49,719
cannabinoids are cuz I mean this is a

2915
02:02:47,238 --> 02:02:51,598
full profile basically this is what I'm

2916
02:02:49,719 --> 02:02:53,078
using for my pain right now and this

2917
02:02:51,599 --> 02:02:54,880
seems seems to be working and it doesn't

2918
02:02:53,078 --> 02:02:56,799
get me high it just actually helps ease

2919
02:02:54,880 --> 02:02:58,520
my pain so I mean these are the

2920
02:02:56,800 --> 02:03:01,320
different canabo that we will be talking

2921
02:02:58,520 --> 02:03:04,079
about all right I wanted to just do a

2922
02:03:01,319 --> 02:03:07,359
clarification for those who are watching

2923
02:03:04,078 --> 02:03:09,479
uh as you know uh Dr Mulan says uh it's

2924
02:03:07,359 --> 02:03:12,319
the Entourage effect but if you actually

2925
02:03:09,479 --> 02:03:15,399
look at nomenclature entourage is just a

2926
02:03:12,319 --> 02:03:19,519
group of people arriving together uh

2927
02:03:15,399 --> 02:03:21,039
where as uh Ensemble is exactly like

2928
02:03:19,520 --> 02:03:23,480
listening to an orchestra if you're

2929
02:03:21,039 --> 02:03:25,399
listening to One note you hear the horns

2930
02:03:23,479 --> 02:03:28,279
but when you hear the whole Orchestra

2931
02:03:25,399 --> 02:03:30,039
That's The Ensemble and so that's why I

2932
02:03:28,279 --> 02:03:33,279
and others have coined the phrase The

2933
02:03:30,039 --> 02:03:34,760
Ensemble effect so just to clarify for

2934
02:03:33,279 --> 02:03:38,399
new people who are watching who are

2935
02:03:34,760 --> 02:03:41,800
saying Entourage so just wanted to

2936
02:03:38,399 --> 02:03:43,960
clarify so uh I wanted to bring up a

2937
02:03:41,800 --> 02:03:46,559
thing I sent a COA number over to you

2938
02:03:43,960 --> 02:03:50,078
Marcus that was

2939
02:03:46,559 --> 02:03:52,480
10.75 came back from I remember that was

2940
02:03:50,078 --> 02:03:55,719
great job separating great job for

2941
02:03:52,479 --> 02:03:58,479
breaching the laws of everything of of

2942
02:03:55,719 --> 02:04:02,800
of of of yeah breaching the laws of of

2943
02:03:58,479 --> 02:04:04,359
Def redefining physics yeah um it uh so

2944
02:04:02,800 --> 02:04:05,840
I just wanted to just just talk about

2945
02:04:04,359 --> 02:04:08,920
this idea because I think there's a lot

2946
02:04:05,840 --> 02:04:10,800
of um a lot of nuance with all these

2947
02:04:08,920 --> 02:04:12,599
terms and things that we've we have and

2948
02:04:10,800 --> 02:04:14,719
pop culture seems to move way faster

2949
02:04:12,599 --> 02:04:17,559
than science in for some reason in in

2950
02:04:14,719 --> 02:04:22,000
this field so Dr Mark in your

2951
02:04:17,559 --> 02:04:23,559
professional opinion um where does 10.75

2952
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:26,760
really makes sense I know that there's

2953
02:04:23,559 --> 02:04:28,440
minors put in there but when the thca

2954
02:04:26,760 --> 02:04:31,760
comes back at

2955
02:04:28,439 --> 02:04:34,759
98 98 and then there's like all these

2956
02:04:31,760 --> 02:04:36,239
other minors it just feels odd to to

2957
02:04:34,760 --> 02:04:38,480
read that and then put that on a package

2958
02:04:36,238 --> 02:04:41,118
for a patient just because I just feel

2959
02:04:38,479 --> 02:04:44,078
like we're at a zero to 100 range at

2960
02:04:41,118 --> 02:04:45,479
what point do we feel like it's okay to

2961
02:04:44,078 --> 02:04:47,799
have the Liberty to go beyond these

2962
02:04:45,479 --> 02:04:50,118
lines and and what does that really mean

2963
02:04:47,800 --> 02:04:53,360
because t as we know means absolutely

2964
02:04:50,118 --> 02:04:55,558
nothing um there's so much more uh to

2965
02:04:53,359 --> 02:04:57,078
The Ensemble and and as you really

2966
02:04:55,559 --> 02:04:59,800
beautifully put it the

2967
02:04:57,078 --> 02:05:01,759
Dynamics um if you're using recording

2968
02:04:59,800 --> 02:05:03,279
instruments you know for example you

2969
02:05:01,760 --> 02:05:06,199
want to record things at a low level

2970
02:05:03,279 --> 02:05:08,078
with great compressors and eqs and you

2971
02:05:06,198 --> 02:05:10,479
know and all that Dynamics really adds

2972
02:05:08,078 --> 02:05:13,759
to the overall experience to that sound

2973
02:05:10,479 --> 02:05:15,238
so what's your take on that so so there

2974
02:05:13,760 --> 02:05:17,320
there's two things you got to consider

2975
02:05:15,238 --> 02:05:20,678
so when when you're when you're when

2976
02:05:17,319 --> 02:05:22,920
you're trying to measure potency when

2977
02:05:20,679 --> 02:05:25,960
you're trying to me measure the amount

2978
02:05:22,920 --> 02:05:27,000
of a cannabinoid either like in hash or

2979
02:05:25,960 --> 02:05:32,279
in

2980
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:34,399
flour um it's 90% of it is how you

2981
02:05:32,279 --> 02:05:37,479
prepare the sample and so like in a

2982
02:05:34,399 --> 02:05:39,879
typical hlc method you would take

2983
02:05:37,479 --> 02:05:42,158
something like about a couple hundred

2984
02:05:39,880 --> 02:05:44,400
milligrams of material and you have to

2985
02:05:42,158 --> 02:05:47,439
weigh it out like you can't weigh

2986
02:05:44,399 --> 02:05:50,638
out just well this is almost 200

2987
02:05:47,439 --> 02:05:54,960
milligrams it has to be

2988
02:05:50,639 --> 02:05:57,639
200.1 two milligrams it can't be 20013

2989
02:05:54,960 --> 02:06:00,000
or two that level of precision will have

2990
02:05:57,639 --> 02:06:01,639
an impact on the measurement you're

2991
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:04,319
making because what you're doing is

2992
02:06:01,639 --> 02:06:06,400
you're taking that measured amount of

2993
02:06:04,319 --> 02:06:09,439
stuff and then you're going to do a

2994
02:06:06,399 --> 02:06:12,158
number of delusions to it and every time

2995
02:06:09,439 --> 02:06:15,919
you do a dilution to it you you

2996
02:06:12,158 --> 02:06:17,558
basically are are um I was going to say

2997
02:06:15,920 --> 02:06:19,840
deluding it

2998
02:06:17,559 --> 02:06:22,719
right you're you're making it less

2999
02:06:19,840 --> 02:06:25,639
concentrated until it gets down to the

3000
02:06:22,719 --> 02:06:28,198
level of concentration that your machine

3001
02:06:25,639 --> 02:06:31,039
has calibrated to read now these

3002
02:06:28,198 --> 02:06:34,399
machines separate things I know Marcus

3003
02:06:31,039 --> 02:06:38,039
we've talked about hlc a lot on on U on

3004
02:06:34,399 --> 02:06:40,439
hash church and we've had people like uh

3005
02:06:38,039 --> 02:06:43,880
the fellow from Su Labs his name's

3006
02:06:40,439 --> 02:06:47,359
escaping me now Alec yeah people talk

3007
02:06:43,880 --> 02:06:49,679
about hlc but how in hplc works is there

3008
02:06:47,359 --> 02:06:52,639
there's a column that you take this

3009
02:06:49,679 --> 02:06:55,039
diluted solution of your of your sample

3010
02:06:52,639 --> 02:06:58,679
and the the sample goes through the

3011
02:06:55,039 --> 02:07:01,158
column and the column think of it like a

3012
02:06:58,679 --> 02:07:03,039
uh like a water filter cartridge like

3013
02:07:01,158 --> 02:07:05,198
that's on your refrigerator if you have

3014
02:07:03,039 --> 02:07:07,599
filtered water that comes through your

3015
02:07:05,198 --> 02:07:11,319
refrigerator or your house or wherever

3016
02:07:07,599 --> 02:07:14,520
so as the solution goes through there

3017
02:07:11,319 --> 02:07:16,519
the canabo have a different affinity for

3018
02:07:14,520 --> 02:07:19,679
sticking to the packing material which

3019
02:07:16,520 --> 02:07:21,719
is called the column and they elute out

3020
02:07:19,679 --> 02:07:23,960
the other end of the column and there's

3021
02:07:21,719 --> 02:07:26,439
something called a detector that's

3022
02:07:23,960 --> 02:07:30,599
looking at a particular wavelength in

3023
02:07:26,439 --> 02:07:33,000
the ultraviolet spectrum that knows what

3024
02:07:30,599 --> 02:07:36,880
wavelength each of the individual

3025
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:38,719
cannabinoids absorb at and so there's

3026
02:07:36,880 --> 02:07:41,679
something that they call standards and

3027
02:07:38,719 --> 02:07:44,639
so in order to calibrate this machine

3028
02:07:41,679 --> 02:07:47,399
properly what they do is you have to buy

3029
02:07:44,639 --> 02:07:50,279
a standard of each of the individual

3030
02:07:47,399 --> 02:07:52,279
purified cannabinoids right and then you

3031
02:07:50,279 --> 02:07:54,960
take that standard and again you do

3032
02:07:52,279 --> 02:07:57,238
what's called serial dilutions which

3033
02:07:54,960 --> 02:07:59,599
basically dilutes the concentration of

3034
02:07:57,238 --> 02:08:03,519
that standard and you inject this into

3035
02:07:59,599 --> 02:08:05,559
your hlc column and what you see is yes

3036
02:08:03,520 --> 02:08:08,880
Johnny showing one right there what you

3037
02:08:05,559 --> 02:08:11,719
see is that there's a linear response

3038
02:08:08,880 --> 02:08:14,279
between the amount of material that

3039
02:08:11,719 --> 02:08:17,158
comes out and that delusion that you've

3040
02:08:14,279 --> 02:08:20,198
made and you you read what's called a

3041
02:08:17,158 --> 02:08:22,558
calibration curve because the intensity

3042
02:08:20,198 --> 02:08:24,719
that the detector picks up of the

3043
02:08:22,559 --> 02:08:26,520
compounds coming out of the column is

3044
02:08:24,719 --> 02:08:29,118
directly proportional to how much of

3045
02:08:26,520 --> 02:08:32,280
that compound is in there and so for

3046
02:08:29,118 --> 02:08:34,960
like 2500 PPM you'll get a signal up

3047
02:08:32,279 --> 02:08:37,078
here and then for like 500 PPM you'll

3048
02:08:34,960 --> 02:08:39,639
get a signal down here and then for like

3049
02:08:37,078 --> 02:08:42,399
100 PPM it'll be down here and so you'll

3050
02:08:39,639 --> 02:08:43,920
draw what's called a calibration curve

3051
02:08:42,399 --> 02:08:47,359
and now what you can do with your

3052
02:08:43,920 --> 02:08:50,800
calibration curve yes Johnny showing a

3053
02:08:47,359 --> 02:08:53,598
chromatogram here so Johnny can now take

3054
02:08:50,800 --> 02:08:55,760
the peak Heights from that which is

3055
02:08:53,599 --> 02:08:57,880
called the chromatogram which is the

3056
02:08:55,760 --> 02:08:59,000
reading of the detector as the compounds

3057
02:08:57,880 --> 02:09:03,000
come out of the

3058
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:07,238
hlc go to your calibration curve and say

3059
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:09,880
if that Peak which is exactly that high

3060
02:09:07,238 --> 02:09:12,439
is that reads this on the calibration

3061
02:09:09,880 --> 02:09:14,039
curve then the concentration is this you

3062
02:09:12,439 --> 02:09:16,319
back it out through your dilution

3063
02:09:14,039 --> 02:09:19,078
calculation you can calculate how much

3064
02:09:16,319 --> 02:09:21,078
canono is actually in a sample so you

3065
02:09:19,078 --> 02:09:23,639
can see with all the mathematics that

3066
02:09:21,078 --> 02:09:26,319
you need to do there and all of the

3067
02:09:23,639 --> 02:09:29,078
manipulation of the sample itself right

3068
02:09:26,319 --> 02:09:32,039
because you have to weigh out exactly to

3069
02:09:29,078 --> 02:09:35,960
the you know what

3070
02:09:32,039 --> 02:09:38,359
0.0000001 gram yeah you know Precision

3071
02:09:35,960 --> 02:09:41,078
that means you you need an analytical

3072
02:09:38,359 --> 02:09:43,839
balance right there that cost like what

3073
02:09:41,078 --> 02:09:47,359
three four5 th000 I mean those are not

3074
02:09:43,840 --> 02:09:50,360
cheap the hlc machines most of them run

3075
02:09:47,359 --> 02:09:52,479
somewhere between maybe 25 $30,000 you

3076
02:09:50,359 --> 02:09:54,279
could get them used for less than that

3077
02:09:52,479 --> 02:09:56,359
but the really good ones with the

3078
02:09:54,279 --> 02:09:59,000
detectors and then you have to buy the

3079
02:09:56,359 --> 02:10:02,319
standards and the standards are really

3080
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:04,960
expensive because the labs that make the

3081
02:10:02,319 --> 02:10:07,519
standards have to have a schedule one

3082
02:10:04,960 --> 02:10:09,880
license because they have to have a lot

3083
02:10:07,520 --> 02:10:12,719
of that material and then they dilute it

3084
02:10:09,880 --> 02:10:15,760
down to the level that the DEA says it's

3085
02:10:12,719 --> 02:10:17,559
okay to ship off as a standard and a

3086
02:10:15,760 --> 02:10:19,599
little bottle like this right Johnny

3087
02:10:17,559 --> 02:10:21,000
cost like a thousand bucks it's really

3088
02:10:19,599 --> 02:10:23,159
expensive it's really expensive but at

3089
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:25,279
the same time you just can't buy it not

3090
02:10:23,158 --> 02:10:26,558
anyone can buy it so not only have to

3091
02:10:25,279 --> 02:10:31,158
buy it

3092
02:10:26,559 --> 02:10:34,119
fromed you can buy it I I was lucky just

3093
02:10:31,158 --> 02:10:37,558
the way things worked and

3094
02:10:34,118 --> 02:10:39,238
most you need a license they they don't

3095
02:10:37,559 --> 02:10:40,719
they don't just give those standards out

3096
02:10:39,238 --> 02:10:42,439
to anybody and then there's another

3097
02:10:40,719 --> 02:10:45,158
thing is that you know even these

3098
02:10:42,439 --> 02:10:47,359
instrument manufacturers I mean they

3099
02:10:45,158 --> 02:10:50,519
will not unless you can show that you

3100
02:10:47,359 --> 02:10:52,960
have a license to operate in your state

3101
02:10:50,520 --> 02:10:54,719
legally they're not going to sell you

3102
02:10:52,960 --> 02:10:58,639
this instrumentation because they don't

3103
02:10:54,719 --> 02:11:01,118
want to be liable for some clandestine

3104
02:10:58,639 --> 02:11:03,559
operation and so it's important I guess

3105
02:11:01,118 --> 02:11:05,759
to have standardized testing and all

3106
02:11:03,559 --> 02:11:08,159
this but you could see that it's really

3107
02:11:05,760 --> 02:11:10,920
easy to come up with a result that's

3108
02:11:08,158 --> 02:11:13,759
101% because what that means is that

3109
02:11:10,920 --> 02:11:16,639
somewhere along the lines in the sample

3110
02:11:13,760 --> 02:11:19,920
preparation most likely or in the

3111
02:11:16,639 --> 02:11:22,159
mathematics that takes the raw data that

3112
02:11:19,920 --> 02:11:25,039
the machine measures and converts it

3113
02:11:22,158 --> 02:11:27,920
into milligram per gram canono or

3114
02:11:25,039 --> 02:11:30,719
percent weight or whatever measurement

3115
02:11:27,920 --> 02:11:34,000
unit you're using all of that is going

3116
02:11:30,719 --> 02:11:36,039
to be impacted on the sample that that

3117
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:38,198
the machine meas the machine just is

3118
02:11:36,039 --> 02:11:41,000
measuring its thing and then you have to

3119
02:11:38,198 --> 02:11:42,439
assume that these machines get clogged

3120
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:44,238
if people don't know what they're doing

3121
02:11:42,439 --> 02:11:47,399
there's all kinds of crap that goes in

3122
02:11:44,238 --> 02:11:49,439
there we use these two Micron syringe

3123
02:11:47,399 --> 02:11:51,679
filters that are really useful to filter

3124
02:11:49,439 --> 02:11:53,879
out any crap because you don't want any

3125
02:11:51,679 --> 02:11:56,039
crap going in there and if you're

3126
02:11:53,880 --> 02:11:58,760
testing a lot of biomass that already

3127
02:11:56,039 --> 02:12:00,639
has a lot of fats waxes and lipids it's

3128
02:11:58,760 --> 02:12:02,760
really advisable to put what's called a

3129
02:12:00,639 --> 02:12:05,559
guard on your column and what that does

3130
02:12:02,760 --> 02:12:07,480
is it it just it extends the lifetime of

3131
02:12:05,559 --> 02:12:10,000
your column because it keeps a lot of

3132
02:12:07,479 --> 02:12:12,238
the high molecular weight [ __ ] from

3133
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:14,319
dumbing up your column because once so

3134
02:12:12,238 --> 02:12:16,919
mark this this material was was

3135
02:12:14,319 --> 02:12:19,679
solventless thca that I had

3136
02:12:16,920 --> 02:12:22,760
extracted mechanically so it came back

3137
02:12:19,679 --> 02:12:26,039
that high I just felt like I just

3138
02:12:22,760 --> 02:12:29,320
couldn't I just don't it's like Tall

3139
02:12:26,039 --> 02:12:31,519
Tails to me you know yes so if if your

3140
02:12:29,319 --> 02:12:34,000
sample doesn't have doesn't have fats

3141
02:12:31,520 --> 02:12:36,840
waxes or lipids it's probably best to

3142
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:39,158
dissolve that in methanol but like

3143
02:12:36,840 --> 02:12:41,480
Johnny was seeing when you dissolve

3144
02:12:39,158 --> 02:12:43,558
samples that have fats waxes and lipids

3145
02:12:41,479 --> 02:12:46,638
and methanol Johnny remember this we

3146
02:12:43,559 --> 02:12:48,840
were seeing white floaties in there

3147
02:12:46,639 --> 02:12:52,159
that's yeah

3148
02:12:48,840 --> 02:12:53,559
that's years ago and it was interesting

3149
02:12:52,158 --> 02:12:55,319
the way I had to figure it out is

3150
02:12:53,559 --> 02:12:57,960
because then I had put it in hexane and

3151
02:12:55,319 --> 02:12:59,599
the hexane melted the fats right so I

3152
02:12:57,960 --> 02:13:01,439
saw that we thought it was they thought

3153
02:12:59,599 --> 02:13:02,760
it was stuff coming from the parment so

3154
02:13:01,439 --> 02:13:04,399
then I called the parchment people and

3155
02:13:02,760 --> 02:13:06,280
they're like there's no [ __ ] way the

3156
02:13:04,399 --> 02:13:08,158
parchment is breaking down and that was

3157
02:13:06,279 --> 02:13:09,599
had to do with the raos in back then so

3158
02:13:08,158 --> 02:13:12,279
it was a lot of fat when we were

3159
02:13:09,599 --> 02:13:14,920
squishing temperat so so what that says

3160
02:13:12,279 --> 02:13:17,158
is that is as that part of what you

3161
02:13:14,920 --> 02:13:20,359
weighed out as part of your analytical

3162
02:13:17,158 --> 02:13:22,238
sample is that fats waxes and lipids

3163
02:13:20,359 --> 02:13:25,279
that that aren't being included so that

3164
02:13:22,238 --> 02:13:27,919
whole measurement is just that you can't

3165
02:13:25,279 --> 02:13:29,399
quantify anything based on that but here

3166
02:13:27,920 --> 02:13:31,199
here's the thing now like if you use

3167
02:13:29,399 --> 02:13:33,158
something like acetone or something to

3168
02:13:31,198 --> 02:13:35,919
dissolve all that stuff now you're

3169
02:13:33,158 --> 02:13:38,000
raming all that [ __ ] into your those

3170
02:13:35,920 --> 02:13:39,319
columns cost about a thousand bucks a

3171
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:41,198
piece or they're you know they're

3172
02:13:39,319 --> 02:13:44,479
expensive and the Machine you're running

3173
02:13:41,198 --> 02:13:48,158
it on is like you know $20,000 machine

3174
02:13:44,479 --> 02:13:50,319
and it it you know there's so again

3175
02:13:48,158 --> 02:13:54,679
answer your question column lots of

3176
02:13:50,319 --> 02:13:57,319
places for that error to occur but um if

3177
02:13:54,679 --> 02:13:59,599
you're looking to do like a a purity

3178
02:13:57,319 --> 02:14:02,799
analysis where you need to get like

3179
02:13:59,599 --> 02:14:05,119
absolute you know you have to do a lot

3180
02:14:02,800 --> 02:14:07,960
of testing to develop a relationship

3181
02:14:05,118 --> 02:14:10,359
with a lab and I would say the Alex

3182
02:14:07,960 --> 02:14:11,920
operation SC is probably one of the more

3183
02:14:10,359 --> 02:14:14,839
better ones I don't know ATN if you

3184
02:14:11,920 --> 02:14:17,118
would agree but I would say the SC in

3185
02:14:14,840 --> 02:14:18,679
general the Steep Hill lab that we work

3186
02:14:17,118 --> 02:14:21,839
with over here in Maryland they're

3187
02:14:18,679 --> 02:14:24,279
really good um Steep Hill Labs they're

3188
02:14:21,840 --> 02:14:26,199
really hit and miss because I've seen

3189
02:14:24,279 --> 02:14:28,399
results on stuff that I know that we've

3190
02:14:26,198 --> 02:14:29,879
already tested and other people T like

3191
02:14:28,399 --> 02:14:31,439
this is what we're saying I'm like hey

3192
02:14:29,880 --> 02:14:33,078
you know what we have the data to

3193
02:14:31,439 --> 02:14:36,039
support it right I mean that's what's

3194
02:14:33,078 --> 02:14:39,078
good about the hlc is that if your

3195
02:14:36,039 --> 02:14:41,840
analytical methods are all proper and

3196
02:14:39,078 --> 02:14:44,439
you have everything that you need to do

3197
02:14:41,840 --> 02:14:47,199
you could challenge the result of some

3198
02:14:44,439 --> 02:14:49,359
marginal lab now what we found is that

3199
02:14:47,198 --> 02:14:51,279
some labs are in high throughput mode

3200
02:14:49,359 --> 02:14:53,519
you know why because their business bus

3201
02:14:51,279 --> 02:14:56,158
model is to run as many [ __ ] samples

3202
02:14:53,520 --> 02:14:59,559
through that lab as they possibly can do

3203
02:14:56,158 --> 02:15:01,399
they give a [ __ ] whether it's. 28.9

3204
02:14:59,559 --> 02:15:02,840
point they don't give a flying [ __ ] they

3205
02:15:01,399 --> 02:15:05,719
just want to get their report and get

3206
02:15:02,840 --> 02:15:08,078
their money that's it right so not us

3207
02:15:05,719 --> 02:15:10,198
we're a little more careful because we

3208
02:15:08,078 --> 02:15:12,679
need to make sure especially in hemp

3209
02:15:10,198 --> 02:15:14,039
operations that we're totally compliant

3210
02:15:12,679 --> 02:15:17,239
and you know what that means that means

3211
02:15:14,039 --> 02:15:20,279
that you know your THC is compliant

3212
02:15:17,238 --> 02:15:22,558
right at that3 level and you know you're

3213
02:15:20,279 --> 02:15:24,118
putting your business at risk if you

3214
02:15:22,559 --> 02:15:26,599
don't know what the hell it is you're

3215
02:15:24,118 --> 02:15:29,279
sending out the door because that stuff

3216
02:15:26,599 --> 02:15:32,000
can be confiscated or other people are

3217
02:15:29,279 --> 02:15:35,399
using those products again to formulate

3218
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:37,078
into soaps or tinctures or whatever and

3219
02:15:35,399 --> 02:15:39,960
if it's not at the right level then that

3220
02:15:37,078 --> 02:15:41,519
means their their doses aren't at the

3221
02:15:39,960 --> 02:15:44,279
right level neither so it's really

3222
02:15:41,520 --> 02:15:47,000
important to have accurate testing all

3223
02:15:44,279 --> 02:15:49,599
along the way the lab that I use is is a

3224
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:51,719
well-known lab I I don't I don't this

3225
02:15:49,599 --> 02:15:54,078
particular one I that's quite surprising

3226
02:15:51,719 --> 02:15:56,279
to me and it was just it was just the

3227
02:15:54,078 --> 02:15:58,198
whole thing surprising and and I see a

3228
02:15:56,279 --> 02:16:01,639
lot because I'm always sending samples

3229
02:15:58,198 --> 02:16:05,319
out um like yourself you just just had

3230
02:16:01,639 --> 02:16:06,800
to ask ask out safe but here's these old

3231
02:16:05,319 --> 02:16:10,078
samples this is kind of some memories

3232
02:16:06,800 --> 02:16:11,559
for me these are old so here's the

3233
02:16:10,078 --> 02:16:13,399
little boxes they used to come in they

3234
02:16:11,559 --> 02:16:14,800
used to come from Switzerland we had to

3235
02:16:13,399 --> 02:16:17,319
order them through a different company

3236
02:16:14,800 --> 02:16:18,840
sent to a different address it was they

3237
02:16:17,319 --> 02:16:21,439
were so hope you're keeping those in the

3238
02:16:18,840 --> 02:16:23,679
freezer Johnny oh these no these on I

3239
02:16:21,439 --> 02:16:25,558
have samples in my fridge ones for a had

3240
02:16:23,679 --> 02:16:26,480
from hlc and these are just the boxes

3241
02:16:25,559 --> 02:16:29,480
from like

3242
02:16:26,479 --> 02:16:32,959
1988 that's how old yeah these are from

3243
02:16:29,479 --> 02:16:35,119
like 1988 like I said this is from 1988

3244
02:16:32,959 --> 02:16:37,318
oh my God yeah the other ones I have are

3245
02:16:35,120 --> 02:16:39,359
in the fridge I got those in like 2012

3246
02:16:37,318 --> 02:16:41,478
but these are when I first started uh

3247
02:16:39,359 --> 02:16:43,040
working with Paul on the with the hplc

3248
02:16:41,478 --> 02:16:44,478
and he taught me a lot of just how to

3249
02:16:43,040 --> 02:16:46,559
use it how the call everything you

3250
02:16:44,478 --> 02:16:48,039
talked about just put me into memories

3251
02:16:46,558 --> 02:16:49,358
of looking at all those different Peaks

3252
02:16:48,040 --> 02:16:51,639
and profiles and all the different

3253
02:16:49,359 --> 02:16:53,318
strains and and really chasing those

3254
02:16:51,638 --> 02:16:54,558
profiles and seeing what was happening

3255
02:16:53,318 --> 02:16:56,879
with all the different strains it was

3256
02:16:54,558 --> 02:16:59,199
interesting to learn that knowledge so

3257
02:16:56,879 --> 02:17:00,638
thanks for that memory oh well that's

3258
02:16:59,200 --> 02:17:03,200
why we had to bring somebody in

3259
02:17:00,638 --> 02:17:05,358
internationally who made the solutions

3260
02:17:03,200 --> 02:17:07,880
so that's why we did that and he taught

3261
02:17:05,359 --> 02:17:10,479
us how to then suspend it in 100%

3262
02:17:07,879 --> 02:17:12,638
alcohol and so we had a standardized

3263
02:17:10,478 --> 02:17:13,920
methodology right so that we could

3264
02:17:12,638 --> 02:17:16,039
actually because we were just going for

3265
02:17:13,920 --> 02:17:17,679
THC originally remember that's where we

3266
02:17:16,040 --> 02:17:19,479
started yeah see there's the old Sigma

3267
02:17:17,679 --> 02:17:21,439
samples CU we were looking at that

3268
02:17:19,478 --> 02:17:23,239
originally we're were like oh my God and

3269
02:17:21,439 --> 02:17:24,840
then they wanted to know who we were

3270
02:17:23,239 --> 02:17:27,119
because this is way before testing we

3271
02:17:24,840 --> 02:17:28,760
were in a lab we're a dispensary and

3272
02:17:27,120 --> 02:17:30,399
they're like get the [ __ ] out of here

3273
02:17:28,760 --> 02:17:32,200
with that [ __ ] so that's when we

3274
02:17:30,398 --> 02:17:34,159
realized when I started asking Ethan

3275
02:17:32,200 --> 02:17:36,880
Russo and all the other experts I was

3276
02:17:34,159 --> 02:17:41,799
like okay who can I pull to actually

3277
02:17:36,879 --> 02:17:44,398
test but my question goes to Sam is so

3278
02:17:41,799 --> 02:17:48,239
you were originally testing for

3279
02:17:44,398 --> 02:17:50,959
THC I guess originally and then when did

3280
02:17:48,239 --> 02:17:53,239
the other cannaboids start to get added

3281
02:17:50,959 --> 02:17:56,919
when did you start to add from the

3282
02:17:53,239 --> 02:17:59,519
beginning we were we were testing for uh

3283
02:17:56,920 --> 02:18:02,120
at least the top 10 con

3284
02:17:59,519 --> 02:18:05,679
cannaboids so you had those you had

3285
02:18:02,120 --> 02:18:11,079
those those standards yes we had them

3286
02:18:05,679 --> 02:18:13,638
all legally and uh also too we we had uh

3287
02:18:11,079 --> 02:18:16,760
more than I think 50

3288
02:18:13,638 --> 02:18:20,199
54 uh of the uh

3289
02:18:16,760 --> 02:18:24,478
tping uh and that was you know very

3290
02:18:20,200 --> 02:18:26,639
early in the uh in the late 80s we were

3291
02:18:24,478 --> 02:18:29,000
doing that because see we had to start

3292
02:18:26,638 --> 02:18:31,679
with THC and then when we had THC then

3293
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:33,398
we found that secondary Spike you know

3294
02:18:31,679 --> 02:18:36,120
and then we did research and found that

3295
02:18:33,398 --> 02:18:40,439
was CBD but you know we didn't have any

3296
02:18:36,120 --> 02:18:43,040
of the standards of CBG CBN you know any

3297
02:18:40,439 --> 02:18:44,960
of that so we' had to add that so it's

3298
02:18:43,040 --> 02:18:47,000
quite amazing I thought it would have

3299
02:18:44,959 --> 02:18:49,199
been a step-by-step process but to know

3300
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:51,318
that you had access to them is kind of

3301
02:18:49,200 --> 02:18:57,359
mindblowing we just we just bought them

3302
02:18:51,318 --> 02:19:00,199
all we had thcv CBC CBG the propyl

3303
02:18:57,359 --> 02:19:01,318
homologues of all those I mean we we had

3304
02:19:00,200 --> 02:19:03,840
them

3305
02:19:01,318 --> 02:19:06,079
all how did you know to have those and

3306
02:19:03,840 --> 02:19:09,239
which ones to have versus ones not to

3307
02:19:06,079 --> 02:19:12,280
have well I didn't know which ones were

3308
02:19:09,239 --> 02:19:16,879
which but uh since I had them all I

3309
02:19:12,280 --> 02:19:19,359
tried them all and uh I I found out no

3310
02:19:16,879 --> 02:19:21,839
it was known the hlc characterization of

3311
02:19:19,359 --> 02:19:24,559
cannabis extracts was was discovered was

3312
02:19:21,840 --> 02:19:29,079
not discovered was reported actually by

3313
02:19:24,558 --> 02:19:32,358
Canadians uh in the early 60s and so

3314
02:19:29,079 --> 02:19:35,359
this was actually just prior to M mum's

3315
02:19:32,359 --> 02:19:39,040
paper in in 64 on the structural

3316
02:19:35,359 --> 02:19:44,840
elucidation so hlc fractionation of the

3317
02:19:39,040 --> 02:19:49,120
canavs uh was was no was hlc was new

3318
02:19:44,840 --> 02:19:51,079
wasn't hlc didn't ex how old as we as we

3319
02:19:49,120 --> 02:19:53,640
know it I mean this is like this is such

3320
02:19:51,079 --> 02:19:55,280
such cool because like if you look at if

3321
02:19:53,639 --> 02:19:57,639
you and you know it's really interesting

3322
02:19:55,280 --> 02:20:01,720
I just I wrote an article that I think

3323
02:19:57,639 --> 02:20:03,559
is being published um on the thing that

3324
02:20:01,719 --> 02:20:07,959
I think I've talked about on hash Church

3325
02:20:03,559 --> 02:20:09,879
which is the group from uh England that

3326
02:20:07,959 --> 02:20:14,239
first isolated

3327
02:20:09,879 --> 02:20:18,119
THC in the late 1800s so in

3328
02:20:14,239 --> 02:20:19,239
1896 is the first reported isolation by

3329
02:20:18,120 --> 02:20:23,120
vacuum

3330
02:20:19,239 --> 02:20:24,079
distillation of THC distillate and if

3331
02:20:23,120 --> 02:20:27,680
you

3332
02:20:24,079 --> 02:20:30,879
look uh no not Todd no Todd was Todd was

3333
02:20:27,680 --> 02:20:33,359
a contemporary of Adams in the 30s no

3334
02:20:30,879 --> 02:20:35,920
man this is in the 1890s this is wood

3335
02:20:33,359 --> 02:20:39,399
Spivy and easterfield oh yeah I've got

3336
02:20:35,920 --> 02:20:41,239
their paper yeah yeah we didn't I Comm

3337
02:20:39,398 --> 02:20:45,239
didn't I send you the preprint that I

3338
02:20:41,239 --> 02:20:47,159
wrote on this Dave sorry um I think

3339
02:20:45,239 --> 02:20:50,680
might sent you one of their papers you

3340
02:20:47,159 --> 02:20:53,559
didn't have too yeah yeah yeah yeah okay

3341
02:20:50,680 --> 02:20:56,840
so so so actually if if you go back and

3342
02:20:53,559 --> 02:20:57,639
it just it's such a fascinating Story

3343
02:20:56,840 --> 02:20:59,239
the

3344
02:20:57,639 --> 02:21:02,159
premum

3345
02:20:59,239 --> 02:21:05,359
THC chemistry you know and and and and

3346
02:21:02,159 --> 02:21:08,119
the way it happened and so this group

3347
02:21:05,359 --> 02:21:10,680
from from England in fact one of the

3348
02:21:08,120 --> 02:21:12,840
guys died I think before the paper

3349
02:21:10,680 --> 02:21:14,760
actually came out wood speed and

3350
02:21:12,840 --> 02:21:17,680
easterfield

3351
02:21:14,760 --> 02:21:20,200
still the stuff that they characterized

3352
02:21:17,680 --> 02:21:22,280
as toxic red oil and that they the way

3353
02:21:20,200 --> 02:21:24,479
they describe it they describe it just

3354
02:21:22,280 --> 02:21:27,200
like THC disl it would be you know it's

3355
02:21:24,478 --> 02:21:29,959
very sticky and they called it toxic but

3356
02:21:27,200 --> 02:21:32,600
to them toxic really was just short for

3357
02:21:29,959 --> 02:21:34,719
intoxicating it wasn't it wasn't toxic

3358
02:21:32,600 --> 02:21:37,600
like the way that we think of the word

3359
02:21:34,719 --> 02:21:40,478
toxic now it was it was the intoxicating

3360
02:21:37,600 --> 02:21:42,640
oil the intoxicating fraction and and

3361
02:21:40,478 --> 02:21:45,599
they thought it was actually canaban o

3362
02:21:42,639 --> 02:21:48,559
and they did Elemental studies and they

3363
02:21:45,600 --> 02:21:50,120
called it canaban all and when you do

3364
02:21:48,559 --> 02:21:53,199
Elemental studies what you're actually

3365
02:21:50,120 --> 02:21:55,399
doing is you're actually burning a

3366
02:21:53,200 --> 02:21:58,960
little bit of the material and when you

3367
02:21:55,398 --> 02:22:02,000
burn carbon containing material it goes

3368
02:21:58,959 --> 02:22:05,879
to carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide

3369
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:07,959
right so from calcul or from calculation

3370
02:22:05,879 --> 02:22:10,478
how much carbon dioxide and how much

3371
02:22:07,959 --> 02:22:12,519
carbon monoxide you measure from the

3372
02:22:10,478 --> 02:22:15,679
burning of a sample this is just called

3373
02:22:12,520 --> 02:22:19,720
combustion analysis you can go back and

3374
02:22:15,680 --> 02:22:21,680
figure out what the carbon and hydrogen

3375
02:22:19,719 --> 02:22:24,639
empirical form formula of the material

3376
02:22:21,680 --> 02:22:27,880
that you're analyzing was I mean this is

3377
02:22:24,639 --> 02:22:30,279
this is 20 years before the discovery of

3378
02:22:27,879 --> 02:22:32,239
the electron folks okay this is

3379
02:22:30,280 --> 02:22:34,920
contemporary with the discovery of the

3380
02:22:32,239 --> 02:22:38,439
light bulb the this is like the

3381
02:22:34,920 --> 02:22:41,239
1890s okay it tells you how far ahead of

3382
02:22:38,439 --> 02:22:44,559
time this this science was that these

3383
02:22:41,239 --> 02:22:48,000
people were doing so their their

3384
02:22:44,559 --> 02:22:50,199
Elemental formula came really close to

3385
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:53,120
canab andol but they didn't quite get it

3386
02:22:50,200 --> 02:22:57,240
but called it canaban all on the paper

3387
02:22:53,120 --> 02:23:00,160
and then later in the 20s in three or

3388
02:22:57,239 --> 02:23:03,239
four backtack papers in four consecutive

3389
02:23:00,159 --> 02:23:06,000
years a British chemist named Sydney

3390
02:23:03,239 --> 02:23:08,079
Khan uh who actually I think he was a

3391
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:10,000
Australian chemist but I think he ended

3392
02:23:08,079 --> 02:23:13,120
up at a at a British

3393
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:16,159
University um figured out the empirical

3394
02:23:13,120 --> 02:23:18,640
formula of THC and figured out for the

3395
02:23:16,159 --> 02:23:21,920
most part the structure and this is all

3396
02:23:18,639 --> 02:23:24,920
before Todd and Adams so this is prior

3397
02:23:21,920 --> 02:23:28,000
to Todd and Adams man they had this [ __ ]

3398
02:23:24,920 --> 02:23:30,439
[ __ ] figured out dude and this is

3399
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:33,040
[ __ ] crazy [ __ ] so then when Todd and

3400
02:23:30,439 --> 02:23:36,079
Adams came along he thing the thing that

3401
02:23:33,040 --> 02:23:40,840
that messed up I think it was more Adams

3402
02:23:36,079 --> 02:23:44,799
than Todd because Adams in uh in two

3403
02:23:40,840 --> 02:23:48,040
years published about 30 papers on his

3404
02:23:44,799 --> 02:23:50,519
isolation of CBD and THC and what he

3405
02:23:48,040 --> 02:23:52,920
thought their structures were were and

3406
02:23:50,520 --> 02:23:55,600
remind yourself that they didn't have

3407
02:23:52,920 --> 02:23:57,359
hlc they didn't have NMR they didn't

3408
02:23:55,600 --> 02:23:59,439
have all the modern methods of

3409
02:23:57,359 --> 02:24:02,840
instrumentation that the later chemists

3410
02:23:59,439 --> 02:24:06,600
that follow like michan and myself have

3411
02:24:02,840 --> 02:24:08,840
so it's just it's just so great for us

3412
02:24:06,600 --> 02:24:10,960
now to be able to understand that

3413
02:24:08,840 --> 02:24:13,359
history and understand where all that

3414
02:24:10,959 --> 02:24:17,719
this stuff came from and so this is way

3415
02:24:13,359 --> 02:24:22,239
before mulam and so so it what

3416
02:24:17,719 --> 02:24:25,959
complicated Adams's assignment was in as

3417
02:24:22,239 --> 02:24:29,639
we know there's a uh a configuration of

3418
02:24:25,959 --> 02:24:31,839
the double bond in THC called Delta 9

3419
02:24:29,639 --> 02:24:33,079
and if given the opportunity Delta 9

3420
02:24:31,840 --> 02:24:35,398
under goes what's called an

3421
02:24:33,079 --> 02:24:38,520
isomerization over to Delta 8 and Delta

3422
02:24:35,398 --> 02:24:41,639
8 we hear a lot about of today because

3423
02:24:38,520 --> 02:24:45,600
there's a lot of people who are using U

3424
02:24:41,639 --> 02:24:48,519
mul chemistry to convert CBD over to

3425
02:24:45,600 --> 02:24:50,680
Delta 8 because Delta 8 is the

3426
02:24:48,520 --> 02:24:52,760
thermodynamic resting spot for that

3427
02:24:50,680 --> 02:24:54,760
double bond you know when you're looking

3428
02:24:52,760 --> 02:24:57,120
at the chemical structure of THC it

3429
02:24:54,760 --> 02:24:58,600
looks like chicken wire you know there's

3430
02:24:57,120 --> 02:25:00,120
kind of like in that North piece of

3431
02:24:58,600 --> 02:25:02,279
chicken wire there's kind of like a

3432
02:25:00,120 --> 02:25:04,600
double bond and where that double bond

3433
02:25:02,279 --> 02:25:07,239
resides is is whether it's not it's

3434
02:25:04,600 --> 02:25:09,680
Delta 9 or Delta 8 and if given the

3435
02:25:07,239 --> 02:25:11,719
opportunity it likes to get away from

3436
02:25:09,680 --> 02:25:14,760
the Benzene ring so it likes to move

3437
02:25:11,719 --> 02:25:19,119
from Delta 9 to Delta 8 it's favored

3438
02:25:14,760 --> 02:25:22,559
just on an energy profile by itself so

3439
02:25:19,120 --> 02:25:24,960
you know Mark that that when you find

3440
02:25:22,559 --> 02:25:28,519
archaeological remains that were high

3441
02:25:24,959 --> 02:25:32,759
THC or even moderate THC it's often

3442
02:25:28,520 --> 02:25:35,920
found as Delta 8 because the Delta 9 is

3443
02:25:32,760 --> 02:25:39,000
gone or converted and the Delta 8 sticks

3444
02:25:35,920 --> 02:25:40,719
around yeah I I I've described it before

3445
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:42,520
on hash Church go back and do our

3446
02:25:40,719 --> 02:25:45,239
homework as kind of like a roller

3447
02:25:42,520 --> 02:25:46,960
coaster right and and that like Delta

3448
02:25:45,239 --> 02:25:48,680
Delta 99's at the top of the hill but

3449
02:25:46,959 --> 02:25:52,000
Delta Eight's at the bottom of the hill

3450
02:25:48,680 --> 02:25:54,840
and once Delta 9ine goes to Delta 8 it

3451
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:57,359
doesn't go back it's like it's the it's

3452
02:25:54,840 --> 02:26:00,478
the more thermodynamically favored

3453
02:25:57,359 --> 02:26:04,079
resting point and and your observation

3454
02:26:00,478 --> 02:26:07,398
there Sam totally speaks to that so so

3455
02:26:04,079 --> 02:26:12,159
anyway and again Delta 8 and Delta 9 by

3456
02:26:07,398 --> 02:26:14,439
most uh hplc methods can be separated so

3457
02:26:12,159 --> 02:26:16,200
you can separate and you can distinguish

3458
02:26:14,439 --> 02:26:19,120
between those two isomers there's a lot

3459
02:26:16,200 --> 02:26:21,640
of talk about this online because

3460
02:26:19,120 --> 02:26:24,600
there's concern about about hemp derived

3461
02:26:21,639 --> 02:26:27,079
Delta a on its quasi legality on and

3462
02:26:24,600 --> 02:26:29,680
that's a whole different uh ball of wax

3463
02:26:27,079 --> 02:26:32,359
but to just go back to the mulam story

3464
02:26:29,680 --> 02:26:35,840
and the and and and Adams is if you go

3465
02:26:32,359 --> 02:26:37,880
back and look at Adams's work it's all

3466
02:26:35,840 --> 02:26:40,639
he doesn't know where that double bond

3467
02:26:37,879 --> 02:26:42,278
is and so he puts it I think in the nine

3468
02:26:40,639 --> 02:26:44,639
position but I think his methyl

3469
02:26:42,279 --> 02:26:48,040
assignment was wrong or they just didn't

3470
02:26:44,639 --> 02:26:50,680
have all the structural data that you

3471
02:26:48,040 --> 02:26:53,080
know michul and others had later in the

3472
02:26:50,680 --> 02:26:56,359
60s after NMR was invented and then when

3473
02:26:53,079 --> 02:26:58,039
hlc was invented I think right away like

3474
02:26:56,359 --> 02:27:00,880
right after there were commercial

3475
02:26:58,040 --> 02:27:02,760
systems the paper I have in fact Marcus

3476
02:27:00,879 --> 02:27:04,318
I believe we talked about this on hash

3477
02:27:02,760 --> 02:27:07,719
church too because it was a group of

3478
02:27:04,318 --> 02:27:11,159
Canadians that did it um uh first

3479
02:27:07,719 --> 02:27:14,879
characterized the hlc separation of the

3480
02:27:11,159 --> 02:27:17,279
cannabinoids and I believe the tpin on

3481
02:27:14,879 --> 02:27:19,759
of of of cannabis I think that was a

3482
02:27:17,279 --> 02:27:22,120
Canadian group that did that when did GC

3483
02:27:19,760 --> 02:27:24,398
start being used Mark do you know yeah

3484
02:27:22,120 --> 02:27:26,840
then GC was around the same time so it

3485
02:27:24,398 --> 02:27:29,358
was important for like all these

3486
02:27:26,840 --> 02:27:31,760
chromatographic methods that they

3487
02:27:29,359 --> 02:27:35,040
actually have the the the packing

3488
02:27:31,760 --> 02:27:37,439
materials and so what made hlc work was

3489
02:27:35,040 --> 02:27:39,720
the column what makes the column work is

3490
02:27:37,439 --> 02:27:42,398
the stuff that goes inside the column

3491
02:27:39,719 --> 02:27:45,159
well check it out that was invented by a

3492
02:27:42,398 --> 02:27:47,639
guy named Jack Kirkland who I actually

3493
02:27:45,159 --> 02:27:48,680
had the unbelievable honor of meeting at

3494
02:27:47,639 --> 02:27:51,920
one

3495
02:27:48,680 --> 02:27:54,559
point um Jack used to work at Dupont

3496
02:27:51,920 --> 02:27:57,318
many many years ago and he left when

3497
02:27:54,559 --> 02:28:00,199
they splintered off uh hulet Packard

3498
02:27:57,318 --> 02:28:02,359
which became now agilant and he was a

3499
02:28:00,200 --> 02:28:05,439
kind old guy I mean really nice guy but

3500
02:28:02,359 --> 02:28:08,239
um they they invented macroporous silica

3501
02:28:05,439 --> 02:28:10,960
which was required in order to make the

3502
02:28:08,239 --> 02:28:15,239
packing material for these

3503
02:28:10,959 --> 02:28:18,318
columns and that enabled the whole

3504
02:28:15,239 --> 02:28:21,520
hlc thing to exist and when they did

3505
02:28:18,318 --> 02:28:23,359
that for GC so gas chromatography rather

3506
02:28:21,520 --> 02:28:25,840
than dissolving the material what you're

3507
02:28:23,359 --> 02:28:28,520
doing is you're again going through that

3508
02:28:25,840 --> 02:28:31,439
elaborate sampling process where you're

3509
02:28:28,520 --> 02:28:34,200
weighing out the sample you know exactly

3510
02:28:31,439 --> 02:28:38,040
what it is and then what you're doing is

3511
02:28:34,200 --> 02:28:42,600
you're you're injecting it into a uh

3512
02:28:38,040 --> 02:28:44,960
injection Port which is a very hot um uh

3513
02:28:42,600 --> 02:28:47,399
plate and on that hot metal plate when

3514
02:28:44,959 --> 02:28:50,398
your sample hits it it's instantly

3515
02:28:47,398 --> 02:28:52,879
vaporized and and and that Vapor now

3516
02:28:50,398 --> 02:28:55,760
travels through the column and so rather

3517
02:28:52,879 --> 02:28:57,879
than a solution traveling through the

3518
02:28:55,760 --> 02:29:00,719
column and separating Things based on

3519
02:28:57,879 --> 02:29:03,959
polarity in the GC what you're doing is

3520
02:29:00,719 --> 02:29:06,358
you're basing things uh Separation on

3521
02:29:03,959 --> 02:29:09,519
differences in boiling points and so

3522
02:29:06,359 --> 02:29:11,680
your your your most volatile components

3523
02:29:09,520 --> 02:29:13,319
are going to come out first right so as

3524
02:29:11,680 --> 02:29:16,079
they percolate through the column your

3525
02:29:13,318 --> 02:29:18,039
tpes come out and then your cannaboids

3526
02:29:16,079 --> 02:29:20,680
come out later because they're your

3527
02:29:18,040 --> 02:29:23,000
higher boiling stuff because gas

3528
02:29:20,680 --> 02:29:25,880
chromatography is based on

3529
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:28,079
separation based on uh boiling through

3530
02:29:25,879 --> 02:29:30,719
the column which is basically just kind

3531
02:29:28,079 --> 02:29:33,439
of like a maze that the compounds have

3532
02:29:30,719 --> 02:29:35,318
to get through and then like hlc there's

3533
02:29:33,439 --> 02:29:37,880
a detector on the other side of that

3534
02:29:35,318 --> 02:29:40,639
column that lights up and makes a peak

3535
02:29:37,879 --> 02:29:43,879
every time a compound comes

3536
02:29:40,639 --> 02:29:45,920
out oh that's a lot we went through GC

3537
02:29:43,879 --> 02:29:48,759
and

3538
02:29:45,920 --> 02:29:51,879
hlc that was a lot but very well said

3539
02:29:48,760 --> 02:29:54,239
and people appreciate that that is uh

3540
02:29:51,879 --> 02:29:56,398
that's good information on a Sunday

3541
02:29:54,239 --> 02:29:58,359
morning it's cool because you know I'm

3542
02:29:56,398 --> 02:30:00,439
getting a lot of inquiries Mark people

3543
02:29:58,359 --> 02:30:02,960
go back and they watch hash church and

3544
02:30:00,439 --> 02:30:05,040
they want to know about like things like

3545
02:30:02,959 --> 02:30:08,559
this I'm going to reference this church

3546
02:30:05,040 --> 02:30:11,439
just because people will know oh what is

3547
02:30:08,559 --> 02:30:13,719
hlc or what is you know one thing i'

3548
02:30:11,439 --> 02:30:16,479
have to say is thatc is really important

3549
02:30:13,719 --> 02:30:18,920
for measuring your canabo and GC is

3550
02:30:16,478 --> 02:30:20,760
really important for measuring your tpin

3551
02:30:18,920 --> 02:30:23,398
and the thing about GC remember you're

3552
02:30:20,760 --> 02:30:25,800
squirting it onto that hot plate on that

3553
02:30:23,398 --> 02:30:27,000
hot plate canabo decarbox silation

3554
02:30:25,799 --> 02:30:28,840
happens

3555
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:31,040
instantaneously so you're not going to

3556
02:30:28,840 --> 02:30:34,318
get a measurement of your

3557
02:30:31,040 --> 02:30:37,120
canabo uh uh profiles in terms of what

3558
02:30:34,318 --> 02:30:38,920
you're going to see in your in your hlc

3559
02:30:37,120 --> 02:30:40,760
because in your hlc you don't see

3560
02:30:38,920 --> 02:30:43,520
decarbox

3561
02:30:40,760 --> 02:30:45,960
silation so I'll add it in the comments

3562
02:30:43,520 --> 02:30:48,600
section as well Mark so when people come

3563
02:30:45,959 --> 02:30:50,639
back what was that I said I'll add it in

3564
02:30:48,600 --> 02:30:51,920
the in the comment section that you me

3565
02:30:50,639 --> 02:30:53,760
that you're what you you know the

3566
02:30:51,920 --> 02:30:55,200
breakdown between the differences and a

3567
02:30:53,760 --> 02:30:57,680
little bit of the history are there any

3568
02:30:55,200 --> 02:31:00,200
questions class I was going to say Mark

3569
02:30:57,680 --> 02:31:02,680
when I had that GC in my garage I found

3570
02:31:00,200 --> 02:31:04,880
that a lot easier to use than the hlc

3571
02:31:02,680 --> 02:31:06,680
was a lot more technical a lot more prep

3572
02:31:04,879 --> 02:31:08,239
work a lot more time where just putting

3573
02:31:06,680 --> 02:31:10,920
it in the side and heating it up and

3574
02:31:08,239 --> 02:31:13,600
putting it into the machine itself um

3575
02:31:10,920 --> 02:31:15,799
was great again there's two types of

3576
02:31:13,600 --> 02:31:17,279
analysis there's qualitative analysis

3577
02:31:15,799 --> 02:31:18,438
where you're looking to qualitate

3578
02:31:17,279 --> 02:31:20,319
something and then there's something

3579
02:31:18,439 --> 02:31:22,520
called quantitative analysis where

3580
02:31:20,318 --> 02:31:24,760
you're just looking to find out how much

3581
02:31:22,520 --> 02:31:26,520
of something is in there and sometimes

3582
02:31:24,760 --> 02:31:28,719
just a yes or no decision you know you

3583
02:31:26,520 --> 02:31:31,159
want to just get a quick shoot on the GC

3584
02:31:28,719 --> 02:31:33,039
and you want to just see your big THC

3585
02:31:31,159 --> 02:31:35,478
Peak and maybe a couple other Peaks and

3586
02:31:33,040 --> 02:31:37,680
that's fine and dandy but if you need to

3587
02:31:35,478 --> 02:31:40,119
correlate it or measure it and

3588
02:31:37,680 --> 02:31:42,279
especially measure it because now you're

3589
02:31:40,120 --> 02:31:46,359
going to take that stuff and put it into

3590
02:31:42,279 --> 02:31:49,359
say I don't know MCT or you're going to

3591
02:31:46,359 --> 02:31:51,640
make some type of product that has to be

3592
02:31:49,359 --> 02:31:53,840
dosed at a particular label

3593
02:31:51,639 --> 02:31:57,239
concentration I don't know how you do

3594
02:31:53,840 --> 02:32:00,639
that without having hlc in internally

3595
02:31:57,239 --> 02:32:01,559
you know U question about uh things like

3596
02:32:00,639 --> 02:32:04,000
orange

3597
02:32:01,559 --> 02:32:06,680
photonics uh these I can't remember

3598
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:08,920
there's a few other um different yeah

3599
02:32:06,680 --> 02:32:10,920
the products like this that you know I

3600
02:32:08,920 --> 02:32:12,398
dream of walking into my hemp fields and

3601
02:32:10,920 --> 02:32:13,920
just like plopping it down and being

3602
02:32:12,398 --> 02:32:16,519
like yeah let's go grab all these

3603
02:32:13,920 --> 02:32:20,520
samples how realistic is a lot of this

3604
02:32:16,520 --> 02:32:21,840
stuff um AR very ACC

3605
02:32:20,520 --> 02:32:23,840
it's not that they're not accurate they

3606
02:32:21,840 --> 02:32:25,639
can only give you a level of precision

3607
02:32:23,840 --> 02:32:27,120
that that's good for you know if you're

3608
02:32:25,639 --> 02:32:28,920
making a decision on whether or not to

3609
02:32:27,120 --> 02:32:31,920
take a crop out of a field you could

3610
02:32:28,920 --> 02:32:36,279
probably use one of those but you can't

3611
02:32:31,920 --> 02:32:38,398
use that to basically use those numbers

3612
02:32:36,279 --> 02:32:40,880
in say like the dosing of a product to

3613
02:32:38,398 --> 02:32:42,159
meet a label requirement no way because

3614
02:32:40,879 --> 02:32:46,199
you're just not going to have the level

3615
02:32:42,159 --> 02:32:48,359
of accuracy it's plus or minus two or 3%

3616
02:32:46,200 --> 02:32:50,399
that just doesn't you know like I said

3617
02:32:48,359 --> 02:32:52,559
that's not even ballpark that's that's

3618
02:32:50,398 --> 02:32:54,478
exit that the ball parks that results

3619
02:32:52,559 --> 02:32:57,199
that's close

3620
02:32:54,478 --> 02:33:00,239
enough I don't find them very accurate

3621
02:32:57,200 --> 02:33:04,240
at all we did all of our lab work for

3622
02:33:00,239 --> 02:33:08,559
both GC and hlc because we had both we

3623
02:33:04,239 --> 02:33:12,680
always had to First dehumidify the

3624
02:33:08,559 --> 02:33:15,559
sample down to almost zero humidity

3625
02:33:12,680 --> 02:33:17,639
moisture and so if you don't if you

3626
02:33:15,559 --> 02:33:19,559
don't have it together you don't have it

3627
02:33:17,639 --> 02:33:22,398
together yeah I mean I mean you bring up

3628
02:33:19,559 --> 02:33:25,359
a a great Point Sam and this is probably

3629
02:33:22,398 --> 02:33:28,318
again a a potential source of that of

3630
02:33:25,359 --> 02:33:31,600
that 101% error that you're seeing which

3631
02:33:28,318 --> 02:33:34,119
is that if you're not drying the

3632
02:33:31,600 --> 02:33:38,399
material and and there could be water

3633
02:33:34,120 --> 02:33:40,279
there as we know you know biomass and uh

3634
02:33:38,398 --> 02:33:42,959
there's Alec okay we get the authority

3635
02:33:40,279 --> 02:33:45,640
in here to tell us about it so it's this

3636
02:33:42,959 --> 02:33:47,919
this sample that just be aware is what's

3637
02:33:45,639 --> 02:33:50,439
called hydroscopic which means it'll

3638
02:33:47,920 --> 02:33:52,359
absorb moisture from the air

3639
02:33:50,439 --> 02:33:55,520
and certainly like if you take

3640
02:33:52,359 --> 02:33:58,200
biomaterial that's been dried and you

3641
02:33:55,520 --> 02:34:00,560
reintroduce it to a moist ambient

3642
02:33:58,200 --> 02:34:02,880
moisture environment it's going to draw

3643
02:34:00,559 --> 02:34:04,799
in moisture and that's going to affect

3644
02:34:02,879 --> 02:34:07,599
the weight of what you're trying to

3645
02:34:04,799 --> 02:34:10,079
measure down to the hundredth of a

3646
02:34:07,600 --> 02:34:12,279
milligram and if you're really trying to

3647
02:34:10,079 --> 02:34:15,920
be really really really really really

3648
02:34:12,279 --> 02:34:19,359
accurate it has to be dried to the point

3649
02:34:15,920 --> 02:34:22,159
of zero water every time every time

3650
02:34:19,359 --> 02:34:23,840
every time and if it's not yeah you're

3651
02:34:22,159 --> 02:34:25,840
gonna have a little bit of Squish in

3652
02:34:23,840 --> 02:34:28,398
your data right so that material was

3653
02:34:25,840 --> 02:34:31,000
bone dry it was just straight thca you

3654
02:34:28,398 --> 02:34:33,199
know mechanically

3655
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:39,680
separated I mean you're talking long

3656
02:34:33,200 --> 02:34:39,680
presses I mean exorb right send me a

3657
02:34:40,200 --> 02:34:45,359
sample I'm only I'm only kidding I would

3658
02:34:42,879 --> 02:34:47,959
but yeah I I appreciate your Insight on

3659
02:34:45,359 --> 02:34:49,920
on thaty you know I I think the FED has

3660
02:34:47,959 --> 02:34:51,839
something bigger on their mind these

3661
02:34:49,920 --> 02:34:53,439
days it does things to my head when I

3662
02:34:51,840 --> 02:34:56,079
put that into the market and I have to

3663
02:34:53,439 --> 02:34:59,479
put that on the label but here here's

3664
02:34:56,079 --> 02:35:01,318
the thing you know like like with thca I

3665
02:34:59,478 --> 02:35:06,199
mean this is this is just a real kind of

3666
02:35:01,318 --> 02:35:08,680
cool thing so you could melt thca at a

3667
02:35:06,200 --> 02:35:11,479
lower temperature below which it

3668
02:35:08,680 --> 02:35:13,920
decarboxylates at yeah so think think

3669
02:35:11,478 --> 02:35:15,679
about that for a second you could

3670
02:35:13,920 --> 02:35:20,398
melt

3671
02:35:15,680 --> 02:35:23,520
thca into a liquid before it'll decarbox

3672
02:35:20,398 --> 02:35:26,760
so if if you have a melting point

3673
02:35:23,520 --> 02:35:31,920
apparatus that's a wonderful wonderful

3674
02:35:26,760 --> 02:35:35,200
way to see how pure your sample is right

3675
02:35:31,920 --> 02:35:37,000
and in fact you know you can in my

3676
02:35:35,200 --> 02:35:39,359
melting point apparatus I could do side

3677
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:41,799
by side samples you know where you can

3678
02:35:39,359 --> 02:35:44,040
do maybe another recrystallization or

3679
02:35:41,799 --> 02:35:46,959
multiple recrystallizations try to

3680
02:35:44,040 --> 02:35:49,359
recrystallize that stuff to

3681
02:35:46,959 --> 02:35:51,079
99.9999% and do side by-side mouthing

3682
02:35:49,359 --> 02:35:55,120
points and see how sharp your melting

3683
02:35:51,079 --> 02:35:55,120
point is sounds like you need to do my

3684
02:35:55,520 --> 02:36:00,840
testing melting point apparatus are

3685
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:02,000
pretty cheap and and I think you can buy

3686
02:36:00,840 --> 02:36:04,478
them I don't think they're that

3687
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:07,719
expensive but it's a great indication

3688
02:36:04,478 --> 02:36:10,119
for crystals like CBD isolate on on

3689
02:36:07,719 --> 02:36:12,679
Purity so it's kind of like Poor Man's

3690
02:36:10,120 --> 02:36:16,000
hlc just to tell you how pure your stuff

3691
02:36:12,680 --> 02:36:17,398
is hey welcome to Alec Mr Alec must have

3692
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:20,279
heard us chatting I don't know if he's

3693
02:36:17,398 --> 02:36:22,920
still there I see a blank blank spot

3694
02:36:20,279 --> 02:36:25,520
where his camera was but uh he

3695
02:36:22,920 --> 02:36:28,439
definitely was here for a

3696
02:36:25,520 --> 02:36:31,720
bit we'll give him a

3697
02:36:28,439 --> 02:36:34,398
welcome he connected telepathically

3698
02:36:31,719 --> 02:36:35,959
right that's it he did he just he felt

3699
02:36:34,398 --> 02:36:38,239
his ears burning he was like I think

3700
02:36:35,959 --> 02:36:40,879
those guys and they're doing the

3701
02:36:38,239 --> 02:36:42,600
testing testing for the emerald cup so

3702
02:36:40,879 --> 02:36:44,639
you know he's the authority right

3703
02:36:42,600 --> 02:36:46,720
remember the day he came on hash church

3704
02:36:44,639 --> 02:36:48,358
and he was like he had just done the

3705
02:36:46,719 --> 02:36:50,569
emerald cup and he's like I kind of feel

3706
02:36:48,359 --> 02:36:54,079
like the Grinch Who Stole

3707
02:36:50,569 --> 02:36:56,719
[Laughter]

3708
02:36:54,079 --> 02:36:58,920
Christmas we l him for it because we

3709
02:36:56,719 --> 02:37:00,959
could see through the talk and the lies

3710
02:36:58,920 --> 02:37:03,079
there he is he's moving around again you

3711
02:37:00,959 --> 02:37:05,199
know because now we had real science to

3712
02:37:03,079 --> 02:37:07,120
see through the the [ __ ] and the

3713
02:37:05,200 --> 02:37:09,800
hearsay in the conjecture you know

3714
02:37:07,120 --> 02:37:11,000
science ended it and yeah Alec felt bad

3715
02:37:09,799 --> 02:37:13,358
because he kicked a whole bunch of

3716
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:15,879
people in the groin because they all

3717
02:37:13,359 --> 02:37:17,120
[ __ ] used you know pesticides and

3718
02:37:15,879 --> 02:37:19,519
things they shouldn't have been used and

3719
02:37:17,120 --> 02:37:21,560
they got caught so it just was

3720
02:37:19,520 --> 02:37:23,720
surprising I think the amount of numbers

3721
02:37:21,559 --> 02:37:27,039
that you know Alec and them found at SC

3722
02:37:23,719 --> 02:37:28,760
Labs you know that uh people thought

3723
02:37:27,040 --> 02:37:30,479
that could got away with so you know

3724
02:37:28,760 --> 02:37:32,840
shame on those people for trying to

3725
02:37:30,478 --> 02:37:34,679
compete with tainted product and go on

3726
02:37:32,840 --> 02:37:35,760
Alec in them for actually catching them

3727
02:37:34,680 --> 02:37:38,079
using real

3728
02:37:35,760 --> 02:37:41,680
science well I don't know that I don't

3729
02:37:38,079 --> 02:37:45,159
know how widespread that issue in in

3730
02:37:41,680 --> 02:37:48,920
water has was really known right I mean

3731
02:37:45,159 --> 02:37:50,398
Mark I mean it we we talked about it on

3732
02:37:48,920 --> 02:37:52,359
hash

3733
02:37:50,398 --> 02:37:54,398
and at the time I did a little poking

3734
02:37:52,359 --> 02:37:56,680
around on the internet but it wasn't

3735
02:37:54,398 --> 02:37:58,760
universally known that if your cakes

3736
02:37:56,680 --> 02:38:02,120
aren't [ __ ] dry they're GNA start

3737
02:37:58,760 --> 02:38:04,279
molding within hours right I mean this

3738
02:38:02,120 --> 02:38:06,920
is just like a biological process that

3739
02:38:04,279 --> 02:38:10,040
you just cannot stop and you need to

3740
02:38:06,920 --> 02:38:13,639
keep your [ __ ] dry right I mean that

3741
02:38:10,040 --> 02:38:16,240
that happened I think in or

3742
02:38:13,639 --> 02:38:18,398
frozen but but didn't that that whole

3743
02:38:16,239 --> 02:38:20,600
Revelation wasn't known in the hash

3744
02:38:18,398 --> 02:38:23,119
Community was it well it kind of got

3745
02:38:20,600 --> 02:38:24,600
learned this way first you know there's

3746
02:38:23,120 --> 02:38:26,520
lot you know I'm not going to go over

3747
02:38:24,600 --> 02:38:28,720
the entire history but at a time where I

3748
02:38:26,520 --> 02:38:31,680
was doing this let's just say there was

3749
02:38:28,719 --> 02:38:33,959
almost nobody online on the internet

3750
02:38:31,680 --> 02:38:37,000
promoting this process and I made a

3751
02:38:33,959 --> 02:38:38,799
massive mistake I made the mistake that

3752
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:41,040
I would take the bubble especially here

3753
02:38:38,799 --> 02:38:44,318
in the Pacific Northwest and I would end

3754
02:38:41,040 --> 02:38:45,960
up you know leave it in patties let it

3755
02:38:44,318 --> 02:38:47,799
so you think it's dry but then it's

3756
02:38:45,959 --> 02:38:50,079
really not dry you roll it into balls

3757
02:38:47,799 --> 02:38:51,759
you get this really beautiful Mar marble

3758
02:38:50,079 --> 02:38:54,039
but if you're getting that marble that

3759
02:38:51,760 --> 02:38:56,159
always told me you know that hash is not

3760
02:38:54,040 --> 02:38:57,840
dry yet it's gone through stages of

3761
02:38:56,159 --> 02:38:59,439
drying and then you're breaking it open

3762
02:38:57,840 --> 02:39:01,840
releasing the lighter color to the

3763
02:38:59,439 --> 02:39:03,359
darker on the outside and mixing it all

3764
02:39:01,840 --> 02:39:05,600
up into a marble and what happened with

3765
02:39:03,359 --> 02:39:08,000
an enormous amount of the the earliest

3766
02:39:05,600 --> 02:39:11,439
water hashes made from bubble bags at

3767
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:14,920
least from 1999 and and and upwards to

3768
02:39:11,439 --> 02:39:16,720
about 2003 or four um we weren't drying

3769
02:39:14,920 --> 02:39:18,760
the hash properly it just wasn't being

3770
02:39:16,719 --> 02:39:20,119
dried so it would do this buttering

3771
02:39:18,760 --> 02:39:22,079
thing where it would just start to kind

3772
02:39:20,120 --> 02:39:25,120
of fall apart and when you crack open a

3773
02:39:22,079 --> 02:39:26,478
ball and smell it you'd have that funky

3774
02:39:25,120 --> 02:39:28,359
smell where you were like there's

3775
02:39:26,478 --> 02:39:30,438
something not right going on in that

3776
02:39:28,359 --> 02:39:32,840
hash like that's a guarantee not right

3777
02:39:30,439 --> 02:39:35,639
that took me

3778
02:39:32,840 --> 02:39:37,920
years of promoting seing and

3779
02:39:35,639 --> 02:39:40,159
microplaning and trying to show people

3780
02:39:37,920 --> 02:39:43,000
like don't P don't put it into a pile

3781
02:39:40,159 --> 02:39:44,799
don't put it you know then people like

3782
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:47,359
Nick te came out was like oh you can dry

3783
02:39:44,799 --> 02:39:48,799
hash in like a day a day and a half but

3784
02:39:47,359 --> 02:39:49,840
not really going over the fact that he

3785
02:39:48,799 --> 02:39:52,318
was in colle

3786
02:39:49,840 --> 02:39:53,840
in this in this dry Aid Place versus the

3787
02:39:52,318 --> 02:39:56,000
Pacific Northwest if you're telling

3788
02:39:53,840 --> 02:39:57,439
someone over and vice versa you know for

3789
02:39:56,000 --> 02:39:59,359
me to be telling him hey it's going to

3790
02:39:57,439 --> 02:40:01,800
take you at least seven days to dry your

3791
02:39:59,359 --> 02:40:04,318
hash my God it would have no turps left

3792
02:40:01,799 --> 02:40:06,000
in it so we learned things like that by

3793
02:40:04,318 --> 02:40:08,239
being different people promoting these

3794
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:10,040
similar things in different places we

3795
02:40:08,239 --> 02:40:11,680
learned that the hash acts differently

3796
02:40:10,040 --> 02:40:14,359
and which you mentioned earlier in

3797
02:40:11,680 --> 02:40:17,000
regards to hydrophilic when the hash is

3798
02:40:14,359 --> 02:40:20,079
sitting out and there's tons of moisture

3799
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:23,279
in the air trust me it's never going to

3800
02:40:20,079 --> 02:40:24,840
dry it'll literally get more wet by

3801
02:40:23,279 --> 02:40:26,439
pulling that [ __ ] out of the out of the

3802
02:40:24,840 --> 02:40:29,200
air so that's where the desicant came

3803
02:40:26,439 --> 02:40:31,120
into play and that's why I always wanted

3804
02:40:29,200 --> 02:40:33,319
people to dry on something like a food

3805
02:40:31,120 --> 02:40:35,279
grade thick cardboard before freeze

3806
02:40:33,318 --> 02:40:37,278
dryer something for home use that didn't

3807
02:40:35,279 --> 02:40:38,680
cost thousands of dollars people are

3808
02:40:37,279 --> 02:40:41,000
already bitching about the cost of

3809
02:40:38,680 --> 02:40:42,520
bubble bags this was 22 years ago and

3810
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:44,279
they were a couple hundred bucks for a

3811
02:40:42,520 --> 02:40:46,560
pair so they certainly weren't going to

3812
02:40:44,279 --> 02:40:48,479
be going out and buying a $8,000 freeze

3813
02:40:46,559 --> 02:40:50,559
dryer to uh you know to take this to

3814
02:40:48,478 --> 02:40:52,079
that level it was for personal and if

3815
02:40:50,559 --> 02:40:54,439
you did it right you could get the hash

3816
02:40:52,079 --> 02:40:56,680
dry in the Pacific Northwest without

3817
02:40:54,439 --> 02:40:59,760
using a desant it was very very

3818
02:40:56,680 --> 02:41:02,760
difficult grading it or seing it very

3819
02:40:59,760 --> 02:41:05,439
very thin so it wasn't piled up and

3820
02:41:02,760 --> 02:41:07,279
holding you know itself inside itself

3821
02:41:05,439 --> 02:41:10,239
again sealing up that hash because it

3822
02:41:07,279 --> 02:41:13,000
would do that even freshly seed so you

3823
02:41:10,239 --> 02:41:14,879
know these are definitely things that um

3824
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:16,840
we Lear the point that I was making and

3825
02:41:14,879 --> 02:41:19,358
I think Alec is is here now and maybe he

3826
02:41:16,840 --> 02:41:22,318
could comment is that I think our

3827
02:41:19,359 --> 02:41:25,159
discussion about this on hash church

3828
02:41:22,318 --> 02:41:29,799
with the data that Alec presented and

3829
02:41:25,159 --> 02:41:32,920
this whole awareness now I I think was a

3830
02:41:29,799 --> 02:41:35,519
outcrop of that of of that episode that

3831
02:41:32,920 --> 02:41:37,439
ATN was talking about which is that you

3832
02:41:35,520 --> 02:41:41,840
know I hate to give you the bad news but

3833
02:41:37,439 --> 02:41:43,680
you know um so totally is that right I

3834
02:41:41,840 --> 02:41:44,559
mean is that the first time that data

3835
02:41:43,680 --> 02:41:47,159
that

3836
02:41:44,559 --> 02:41:50,639
supported um

3837
02:41:47,159 --> 02:41:55,200
microbial contamination of improperly

3838
02:41:50,639 --> 02:41:55,199
dried hash is a widespread

3839
02:41:58,760 --> 02:42:03,159
phenomena iiz was that was that for a

3840
02:42:02,040 --> 02:42:08,319
question to

3841
02:42:03,159 --> 02:42:09,799
me yeah yeah well so so yeah I mean uh

3842
02:42:08,318 --> 02:42:12,879
it it yeah it's been very fascinating I

3843
02:42:09,799 --> 02:42:14,959
think I feel like through through um you

3844
02:42:12,879 --> 02:42:17,119
know incredible kind of vehicles like

3845
02:42:14,959 --> 02:42:19,039
hash Church you know I definitely feel

3846
02:42:17,120 --> 02:42:20,640
as though it kind of helped to push kind

3847
02:42:19,040 --> 02:42:22,600
of forward a lot of the Consciousness

3848
02:42:20,639 --> 02:42:24,760
and understanding of these these kind of

3849
02:42:22,600 --> 02:42:26,600
shortfalls in or pitfalls with certain

3850
02:42:24,760 --> 02:42:28,920
types of extraction whether you know

3851
02:42:26,600 --> 02:42:31,120
kind of you know microbial kind of

3852
02:42:28,920 --> 02:42:33,239
overgrowth is a PO because of the

3853
02:42:31,120 --> 02:42:35,319
presence of moisture or in the case of

3854
02:42:33,239 --> 02:42:37,159
pesticides the way kind of pesticides

3855
02:42:35,318 --> 02:42:38,519
carry over and concentrate in extraction

3856
02:42:37,159 --> 02:42:41,039
processes especially ones that aren't

3857
02:42:38,520 --> 02:42:43,840
necessarily water soluble but um yeah I

3858
02:42:41,040 --> 02:42:45,760
mean I definitely dig up pastur just

3859
02:42:43,840 --> 02:42:47,719
understanding how many people kind of uh

3860
02:42:45,760 --> 02:42:50,478
that are passionate enthusiasts of this

3861
02:42:47,719 --> 02:42:52,079
plant and of of perfecting that have

3862
02:42:50,478 --> 02:42:56,438
kind of gained and learned from this

3863
02:42:52,079 --> 02:42:58,600
this uh this Avenue um but yeah I mean

3864
02:42:56,439 --> 02:43:01,840
but but Mark I because I I I I tuned

3865
02:42:58,600 --> 02:43:04,559
into the the live YouTube and I I heard

3866
02:43:01,840 --> 02:43:06,239
you talking about hcgc and and you so

3867
02:43:04,559 --> 02:43:07,318
much respect to you I mean I'm not in

3868
02:43:06,239 --> 02:43:08,799
any way I mean I'm one of the

3869
02:43:07,318 --> 02:43:10,879
co-founders of SC Labs I'm not a

3870
02:43:08,799 --> 02:43:12,318
scientist myself I'm kind of more from

3871
02:43:10,879 --> 02:43:14,239
you know the cultivation kind of

3872
02:43:12,318 --> 02:43:16,639
cannabis side of um you know

3873
02:43:14,239 --> 02:43:17,959
front-facing side of our business but I

3874
02:43:16,639 --> 02:43:20,079
you know I'd like to think of become a

3875
02:43:17,959 --> 02:43:22,478
trained parakeet and being able to you

3876
02:43:20,079 --> 02:43:24,639
know at least grasp understand talk and

3877
02:43:22,478 --> 02:43:26,599
convey you know some high scientific

3878
02:43:24,639 --> 02:43:28,199
kind of perspectives and understandings

3879
02:43:26,600 --> 02:43:29,840
that you know I've come to learn and

3880
02:43:28,200 --> 02:43:31,640
we've come to learn from Trends you know

3881
02:43:29,840 --> 02:43:34,040
from testing over the last

3882
02:43:31,639 --> 02:43:35,639
decade yeah totally I mean I I think

3883
02:43:34,040 --> 02:43:37,800
that you know I mean you mentioned hash

3884
02:43:35,639 --> 02:43:39,599
church and before we were talking about

3885
02:43:37,799 --> 02:43:44,199
kind of like the Grateful Dead scene and

3886
02:43:39,600 --> 02:43:48,600
it's like to me man I mean h how how

3887
02:43:44,200 --> 02:43:51,200
lucky are we to live when we did we

3888
02:43:48,600 --> 02:43:52,640
Traverse a millennium okay we were born

3889
02:43:51,200 --> 02:43:55,399
in another

3890
02:43:52,639 --> 02:43:57,959
Millennium and and and we were alive

3891
02:43:55,398 --> 02:44:00,639
during during miles DAV we were alive

3892
02:43:57,959 --> 02:44:03,599
during Bob Marley I was I saw Jerry

3893
02:44:00,639 --> 02:44:07,639
Garcia in a building I think what almost

3894
02:44:03,600 --> 02:44:12,680
200 times I it just to me it's like we

3895
02:44:07,639 --> 02:44:14,599
we we have a really unique opportunity

3896
02:44:12,680 --> 02:44:18,479
to really bring

3897
02:44:14,600 --> 02:44:21,120
together this you know passion that all

3898
02:44:18,478 --> 02:44:24,639
of us have for the plant and people who

3899
02:44:21,120 --> 02:44:26,240
really love you know where this industry

3900
02:44:24,639 --> 02:44:27,478
is going when I say industry yeah

3901
02:44:26,239 --> 02:44:29,600
there's a lot of things that I don't

3902
02:44:27,478 --> 02:44:32,959
like about it because there's like suits

3903
02:44:29,600 --> 02:44:35,079
and ties and money and having to raise

3904
02:44:32,959 --> 02:44:37,079
tons of money but you know on the other

3905
02:44:35,079 --> 02:44:39,600
side of that you have an industry that

3906
02:44:37,079 --> 02:44:42,039
has standardized testing you have people

3907
02:44:39,600 --> 02:44:44,040
who understand that hlc is not just

3908
02:44:42,040 --> 02:44:46,279
something that you're paying for at the

3909
02:44:44,040 --> 02:44:48,600
testing lab but I have to have that at

3910
02:44:46,279 --> 02:44:50,720
my production facility too because how

3911
02:44:48,600 --> 02:44:53,200
the hell do I know what I'm making if

3912
02:44:50,719 --> 02:44:56,358
I'm making extracts and I I don't do any

3913
02:44:53,200 --> 02:44:58,560
internal testing before so we use

3914
02:44:56,359 --> 02:45:00,760
thirdparty testing all the time and it's

3915
02:44:58,559 --> 02:45:03,519
always to validate things that we've

3916
02:45:00,760 --> 02:45:05,880
already tested 10 ways between now and

3917
02:45:03,520 --> 02:45:07,359
last Sunday we know what that result's

3918
02:45:05,879 --> 02:45:09,000
going to come back when we send it over

3919
02:45:07,359 --> 02:45:10,840
to fence to third party lab because

3920
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:13,719
we've already tested it a whole bunch of

3921
02:45:10,840 --> 02:45:16,079
times and we're making sure that a

3922
02:45:13,719 --> 02:45:19,559
tinure bottle or whatever I mean the

3923
02:45:16,079 --> 02:45:23,079
right label information is coherent with

3924
02:45:19,559 --> 02:45:25,879
you know again every best you know

3925
02:45:23,079 --> 02:45:27,359
analytical method that we have now we do

3926
02:45:25,879 --> 02:45:29,599
have the luxury of standing on the

3927
02:45:27,359 --> 02:45:32,079
shoulders of these Giants that came

3928
02:45:29,600 --> 02:45:34,760
before us and as you look at you know

3929
02:45:32,079 --> 02:45:38,120
all the cannaboid chemistry literature

3930
02:45:34,760 --> 02:45:41,000
which is Rich with just Discovery

3931
02:45:38,120 --> 02:45:43,279
discovery made in an environment with

3932
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:45,879
Incredible headwinds where you can't do

3933
02:45:43,279 --> 02:45:47,800
research on this plant you know and

3934
02:45:45,879 --> 02:45:50,119
still people did research because they

3935
02:45:47,799 --> 02:45:52,159
knew how important this plant was and it

3936
02:45:50,120 --> 02:45:54,079
happened in other places other than the

3937
02:45:52,159 --> 02:45:56,039
United States because of it and and

3938
02:45:54,079 --> 02:45:58,879
that's fine I mean the chemical

3939
02:45:56,040 --> 02:46:00,960
literature for a scientist like me is my

3940
02:45:58,879 --> 02:46:04,119
crystal ball right and I could look into

3941
02:46:00,959 --> 02:46:07,559
that crystal ball and I could see I

3942
02:46:04,120 --> 02:46:09,720
could see what can be and and only I

3943
02:46:07,559 --> 02:46:11,959
because my eyes grew up I mean I used to

3944
02:46:09,719 --> 02:46:14,079
play with Legos when I was a kid right

3945
02:46:11,959 --> 02:46:16,559
and not like Star Wars Legos and these

3946
02:46:14,079 --> 02:46:19,439
were just the the blocks here's just a

3947
02:46:16,559 --> 02:46:22,239
bunch of red and green and blue there

3948
02:46:19,439 --> 02:46:25,559
were no no directions and I think

3949
02:46:22,239 --> 02:46:28,478
nonlinear thought and how kids are able

3950
02:46:25,559 --> 02:46:31,840
to really put together in a nonlinear

3951
02:46:28,478 --> 02:46:34,278
way things helps people understand you

3952
02:46:31,840 --> 02:46:35,960
know that you know we're just part of

3953
02:46:34,279 --> 02:46:38,600
this Continuum you know and we're all

3954
02:46:35,959 --> 02:46:40,879
lucky to be alive right now because man

3955
02:46:38,600 --> 02:46:43,880
where the plant is right now and we're

3956
02:46:40,879 --> 02:46:45,478
at the BRD of a new uh Administration

3957
02:46:43,879 --> 02:46:48,438
that's going to get in there and change

3958
02:46:45,478 --> 02:46:51,239
a lot of the laws that are wrong and

3959
02:46:48,439 --> 02:46:53,200
still we need to be proactive and I'm

3960
02:46:51,239 --> 02:46:54,680
sure ATM will agree with me that there's

3961
02:46:53,200 --> 02:46:56,520
still a lot of things that are wrong

3962
02:46:54,680 --> 02:46:58,840
that need to be fixed you know we need

3963
02:46:56,520 --> 02:47:01,239
to be able to get records expunged we

3964
02:46:58,840 --> 02:47:04,239
need to be able to get away from this

3965
02:47:01,239 --> 02:47:06,959
all the things that prohibition did to

3966
02:47:04,239 --> 02:47:09,318
drag down our society and to me it's

3967
02:47:06,959 --> 02:47:11,519
like the Grateful Dead was this thing

3968
02:47:09,318 --> 02:47:13,000
that was going along and that was just

3969
02:47:11,520 --> 02:47:16,120
gonna

3970
02:47:13,000 --> 02:47:17,680
again eventually expel its fruits into

3971
02:47:16,120 --> 02:47:20,040
something that was going to be bigger

3972
02:47:17,680 --> 02:47:21,840
than it ever imagined it would be and

3973
02:47:20,040 --> 02:47:23,720
that's where we're at so are you saying

3974
02:47:21,840 --> 02:47:26,439
are you saying you don't play with Star

3975
02:47:23,719 --> 02:47:26,438
Wars Lego

3976
02:47:26,600 --> 02:47:30,960
anymore no I'm just saying that the

3977
02:47:28,680 --> 02:47:33,079
Legos that my kids grew up playing with

3978
02:47:30,959 --> 02:47:35,199
were different than the Legos that I had

3979
02:47:33,079 --> 02:47:38,000
when I was a kid right I mean we were

3980
02:47:35,200 --> 02:47:40,359
lucky to have the Legos where I can put

3981
02:47:38,000 --> 02:47:44,239
two little rubber tires and a wheel in

3982
02:47:40,359 --> 02:47:46,600
there you know but I you guys um my dad

3983
02:47:44,239 --> 02:47:48,318
just walked in the door so thanks very

3984
02:47:46,600 --> 02:47:51,600
much and I've had such a great morning

3985
02:47:48,318 --> 02:47:53,719

3988
02:47:56,959 --> 02:48:02,358
Johnny B and and I'd love to love to

3989
02:47:59,840 --> 02:48:06,159
build on a part of Marcus's I'm sorry uh

3990
02:48:02,359 --> 02:48:08,880
um um yes Dr Mark's points he was just

3991
02:48:06,159 --> 02:48:10,760
making um you know that's one of the

3992
02:48:08,879 --> 02:48:12,759
most fascinating things and I mean I

3993
02:48:10,760 --> 02:48:14,880
I've described it kind of in in effort

3994
02:48:12,760 --> 02:48:16,120
kind of across uh different episodes of

3995
02:48:14,879 --> 02:48:19,278
House Church that I've been able to be

3996
02:48:16,120 --> 02:48:20,960
part of but you know just learning from

3997
02:48:19,279 --> 02:48:22,680
the data you know the trends in the data

3998
02:48:20,959 --> 02:48:24,318
over hundreds of thousands of data

3999
02:48:22,680 --> 02:48:26,239
points over the last 10 years you know

4000
02:48:24,318 --> 02:48:27,760
it's it's really so much brought me such

4001
02:48:26,239 --> 02:48:29,478
excitement and optimism about where this

4002
02:48:27,760 --> 02:48:31,398
is going although there's all these

4003
02:48:29,478 --> 02:48:33,119
efforts and corporate Predator

4004
02:48:31,398 --> 02:48:34,799
capitalism trying to come in to try to

4005
02:48:33,120 --> 02:48:36,120
pillage and you know kind of take

4006
02:48:34,799 --> 02:48:38,079
advantage of this plant or profit on

4007
02:48:36,120 --> 02:48:40,000
this plant but there's so many built-in

4008
02:48:38,079 --> 02:48:41,639
teachings and lessons that you either

4009
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:43,359
have learned or you have not even you

4010
02:48:41,639 --> 02:48:45,959
don't even [ __ ] have a clue you know

4011
02:48:43,359 --> 02:48:50,720
excuse my language but you know kind of

4012
02:48:45,959 --> 02:48:50,719
you know service to this plant in

4013
02:48:54,520 --> 02:48:58,920
various methods of hash extraction I

4014
02:48:56,799 --> 02:49:00,519
mean there's so much to learn and and

4015
02:48:58,920 --> 02:49:02,318
and you know kind of if you you know

4016
02:49:00,520 --> 02:49:03,520
just using cultivation as example if

4017
02:49:02,318 --> 02:49:05,639
you've never gotten hit by broad mites

4018
02:49:03,520 --> 02:49:07,200
and spider mites and white rud AIDS and

4019
02:49:05,639 --> 02:49:08,799
white flies and you know all the

4020
02:49:07,200 --> 02:49:10,359
potential pests how do you know how to

4021
02:49:08,799 --> 02:49:11,478
deal with it and so I just feel like

4022
02:49:10,359 --> 02:49:13,559
this's this built-in like tribal

4023
02:49:11,478 --> 02:49:15,079
knowledge and awareness that that those

4024
02:49:13,559 --> 02:49:17,719
that have been serviced plant for so

4025
02:49:15,079 --> 02:49:19,478
long have that is a massive competitive

4026
02:49:17,719 --> 02:49:22,000
advantage in the in a coming Global

4027
02:49:19,478 --> 02:49:24,079
regulated market especially you know and

4028
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:25,959
and and and on this idea of how do we

4029
02:49:24,079 --> 02:49:27,840
you know kind of as thought leaders in

4030
02:49:25,959 --> 02:49:29,879
the community really help drive you know

4031
02:49:27,840 --> 02:49:31,920
kind of the way this is all shaped up

4032
02:49:29,879 --> 02:49:35,199
you know because in California you know

4033
02:49:31,920 --> 02:49:37,398
we're seeing so many efforts uh you know

4034
02:49:35,200 --> 02:49:39,239
to kind of just monocrop and just blow

4035
02:49:37,398 --> 02:49:41,159
this plant up but you know I feel like

4036
02:49:39,238 --> 02:49:42,119
the level of huis that people come into

4037
02:49:41,159 --> 02:49:44,478
this plant with thinking they're just

4038
02:49:42,120 --> 02:49:46,520
going to throw money at it and kind of

4039
02:49:44,478 --> 02:49:48,840
just Crush everybody is proportional to

4040
02:49:46,520 --> 02:49:51,200
how quickly face plant you know off The

4041
02:49:48,840 --> 02:49:53,040
Starting Line you know and you know just

4042
02:49:51,200 --> 02:49:55,600
I'm I'm just witnessing everybody

4043
02:49:53,040 --> 02:49:57,600
invests so much money into the worst

4044
02:49:55,600 --> 02:49:59,960
spaces in the state to grow that are

4045
02:49:57,600 --> 02:50:02,559
just right in the deepest heart of you

4046
02:49:59,959 --> 02:50:04,959
know the EG the industrial egg kind of

4047
02:50:02,559 --> 02:50:07,238
legacy and and you know in areas like

4048
02:50:04,959 --> 02:50:09,398
Selenas which you know I'm in Santa Cruz

4049
02:50:07,238 --> 02:50:12,119
California and you know Selenas is you

4050
02:50:09,398 --> 02:50:14,680
know kind of a 45 minute drive Selenas

4051
02:50:12,120 --> 02:50:16,600
you know and that area is you know the

4052
02:50:14,680 --> 02:50:19,479
the solid bowl of the United States you

4053
02:50:16,600 --> 02:50:21,238
know like 70 80 plus % of the you know

4054
02:50:19,478 --> 02:50:23,000
vegetables and produce kind of produced

4055
02:50:21,238 --> 02:50:24,719
out of that area and so whenever you

4056
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:27,040
have cultivation kind of happening in

4057
02:50:24,719 --> 02:50:29,079
the in in the heart of these areas you

4058
02:50:27,040 --> 02:50:30,560
know it's like that area particularly

4059
02:50:29,079 --> 02:50:32,359
you know it's not just one crop that

4060
02:50:30,559 --> 02:50:33,920
they're growing like almonds where

4061
02:50:32,359 --> 02:50:35,559
there's a set regimen of Organo

4062
02:50:33,920 --> 02:50:38,120
phosphates and pesticides and fungicides

4063
02:50:35,559 --> 02:50:40,278
they spray each year it's a rotation of

4064
02:50:38,120 --> 02:50:42,680
all these different crops from brasas to

4065
02:50:40,279 --> 02:50:43,800
Greens to kind of you know in each crop

4066
02:50:42,680 --> 02:50:45,439
planted throughout different times of

4067
02:50:43,799 --> 02:50:47,920
the year sprayed with different levels

4068
02:50:45,439 --> 02:50:49,800
of pesticides and fungicides and so I

4069
02:50:47,920 --> 02:50:51,359
feel like you know just uh on that idea

4070
02:50:49,799 --> 02:50:53,840
you were talking about Mark with the you

4071
02:50:51,359 --> 02:50:55,439
know the the crystal ball you know from

4072
02:50:53,840 --> 02:50:57,000
the data I almost feel the same thing

4073
02:50:55,439 --> 02:50:59,600
almost see like this back of future

4074
02:50:57,000 --> 02:51:01,639
sports Almanac of you know to seeing who

4075
02:50:59,600 --> 02:51:05,120
are you coming potential winners and

4076
02:51:01,639 --> 02:51:06,920
losers of where it's going and and um

4077
02:51:05,120 --> 02:51:09,600
you know just I feel like as long as you

4078
02:51:06,920 --> 02:51:11,799
know we have this eternal vigilance to

4079
02:51:09,600 --> 02:51:14,040
kind of not have things kind of be

4080
02:51:11,799 --> 02:51:15,318
deregulated or allow the deregulation of

4081
02:51:14,040 --> 02:51:17,000
this you know because they put in so

4082
02:51:15,318 --> 02:51:19,238
much regulation and I think there's yeah

4083
02:51:17,000 --> 02:51:22,040
tons of it taxation kinds of stuff that

4084
02:51:19,238 --> 02:51:25,318
is um incredibly important that we work

4085
02:51:22,040 --> 02:51:26,760
to kind of Reform and change but you

4086
02:51:25,318 --> 02:51:28,920
know with regard to the testing

4087
02:51:26,760 --> 02:51:31,200
regulations you know I feel like um it's

4088
02:51:28,920 --> 02:51:33,120
a it's a barrier of Entry it's a it's a

4089
02:51:31,200 --> 02:51:35,120
leveling of the playing field you know

4090
02:51:33,120 --> 02:51:38,319
you know once this goes National you

4091
02:51:35,120 --> 02:51:40,720
know you can't just plant a 100 acres of

4092
02:51:38,318 --> 02:51:42,600
of cannabis in the middle of the Cal you

4093
02:51:40,719 --> 02:51:44,318
know in the middle of the heartland of

4094
02:51:42,600 --> 02:51:48,040
Agriculture like the the millions of

4095
02:51:44,318 --> 02:51:49,639
Acres of uh of dust bowl across the

4096
02:51:48,040 --> 02:51:51,399
Midwest

4097
02:51:49,639 --> 02:51:53,119
you know because that has there massive

4098
02:51:51,398 --> 02:51:55,238
bi remediation fire remediation has to

4099
02:51:53,120 --> 02:51:57,239
occur you know before there can be any

4100
02:51:55,238 --> 02:51:58,680
potential to grow cannabis that's going

4101
02:51:57,238 --> 02:52:00,760
to compete on a national Market that's

4102
02:51:58,680 --> 02:52:02,398
going to pass and be able to you know be

4103
02:52:00,760 --> 02:52:03,880
made available to the public you know

4104
02:52:02,398 --> 02:52:06,238
with these levels of public health

4105
02:52:03,879 --> 02:52:08,159
safety standards sorry go ahead Mark

4106
02:52:06,238 --> 02:52:10,000
what I see Alec I mean I think the the

4107
02:52:08,159 --> 02:52:11,600
these are all great points I think Colin

4108
02:52:10,000 --> 02:52:14,760
might be able to comment on this too as

4109
02:52:11,600 --> 02:52:16,960
well is as programs open up out in the

4110
02:52:14,760 --> 02:52:19,200
eastern United States out in the states

4111
02:52:16,959 --> 02:52:21,278
be uh this side in Mississippi

4112
02:52:19,200 --> 02:52:23,640
is that I think they recognize the

4113
02:52:21,279 --> 02:52:25,960
importance of the testing industry has

4114
02:52:23,639 --> 02:52:27,920
to kind of like be a sister industry to

4115
02:52:25,959 --> 02:52:29,879
the to the production industry itself

4116
02:52:27,920 --> 02:52:31,439
meaning that they need to have two sets

4117
02:52:29,879 --> 02:52:33,318
of businesses in the state they need to

4118
02:52:31,439 --> 02:52:36,439
have the producers the people who are

4119
02:52:33,318 --> 02:52:38,478
growing extracting making formulated

4120
02:52:36,439 --> 02:52:41,279
products and dispensing those products

4121
02:52:38,478 --> 02:52:43,438
but we also need to have third-party

4122
02:52:41,279 --> 02:52:46,760
independent Testing Lab that need to be

4123
02:52:43,439 --> 02:52:49,318
completely different set of people doing

4124
02:52:46,760 --> 02:52:51,159
those business operations not the same

4125
02:52:49,318 --> 02:52:53,359
set of people you know and I think

4126
02:52:51,159 --> 02:52:55,238
there's always a confusion I think that

4127
02:52:53,359 --> 02:52:58,120
people always have about testing that

4128
02:52:55,238 --> 02:53:00,478
it's somehow it's some Panacea and some

4129
02:52:58,120 --> 02:53:02,200
it's some box oh well they'll they'll

4130
02:53:00,478 --> 02:53:04,599
test it everything will be test it's

4131
02:53:02,200 --> 02:53:07,680
like again I think that it's really

4132
02:53:04,600 --> 02:53:08,840
naive to even open up a production

4133
02:53:07,680 --> 02:53:11,720
facility where you're going to be

4134
02:53:08,840 --> 02:53:14,398
spending you know hundreds of thousands

4135
02:53:11,719 --> 02:53:17,559
if not millions of dollars uh to put

4136
02:53:14,398 --> 02:53:20,238
into developing a licensed production

4137
02:53:17,559 --> 02:53:22,600
facility without having internal

4138
02:53:20,238 --> 02:53:24,719
analytics and if you don't have internal

4139
02:53:22,600 --> 02:53:27,040
analytics and you're just going to send

4140
02:53:24,719 --> 02:53:28,879
all your stuff over the fence well then

4141
02:53:27,040 --> 02:53:31,920
you're going to have prohibitively long

4142
02:53:28,879 --> 02:53:33,879
production timelines because in order to

4143
02:53:31,920 --> 02:53:35,760
your formulate your distillate you need

4144
02:53:33,879 --> 02:53:37,199
to know what your distillate test that

4145
02:53:35,760 --> 02:53:39,318
so what are you going to do test your

4146
02:53:37,200 --> 02:53:41,239
distillate then wait around 10 days for

4147
02:53:39,318 --> 02:53:43,278
that result to come back before you

4148
02:53:41,238 --> 02:53:45,199
formulate the distillate no you want to

4149
02:53:43,279 --> 02:53:48,238
test it right then and there and and

4150
02:53:45,200 --> 02:53:50,640
have testing capabilities all throughout

4151
02:53:48,238 --> 02:53:53,639
the selection of your biomass you know

4152
02:53:50,639 --> 02:53:55,760
you don't just take a COA from some Farm

4153
02:53:53,639 --> 02:53:58,398
you should be testing the biomass

4154
02:53:55,760 --> 02:54:00,398
yourself any type of whether you're

4155
02:53:58,398 --> 02:54:02,318
buying crude or whether you're buying

4156
02:54:00,398 --> 02:54:04,000
distillate or whether you're buying any

4157
02:54:02,318 --> 02:54:06,398
process intermediate yeah it's going to

4158
02:54:04,000 --> 02:54:09,159
show up with a COA but wouldn't it be

4159
02:54:06,398 --> 02:54:11,119
great to do the testing yourself and

4160
02:54:09,159 --> 02:54:13,238
what we found I mean this is in

4161
02:54:11,120 --> 02:54:15,479
interesting Alec because again I don't

4162
02:54:13,238 --> 02:54:18,039
usually say this with a lot of people is

4163
02:54:15,478 --> 02:54:19,639
that some testing labs are again in this

4164
02:54:18,040 --> 02:54:22,640
high throughput mode and they're just

4165
02:54:19,639 --> 02:54:25,639
sort of like you know grinding out never

4166
02:54:22,639 --> 02:54:30,398
failing yeah totally yeah so you know

4167
02:54:25,639 --> 02:54:34,599
how you run your hlc is kind of like how

4168
02:54:30,398 --> 02:54:36,719
you drive your car in a way well and and

4169
02:54:34,600 --> 02:54:38,079
if I real quick to it and I apologize

4170
02:54:36,719 --> 02:54:39,519
Colin I think you were about to jump in

4171
02:54:38,079 --> 02:54:41,238
but just I'd love to make a point real

4172
02:54:39,520 --> 02:54:43,159
quick because you know that's another

4173
02:54:41,238 --> 02:54:44,760
thing we're seeing from California and

4174
02:54:43,159 --> 02:54:46,639
and some of the leadership that the way

4175
02:54:44,760 --> 02:54:48,880
California you know regulated the you

4176
02:54:46,639 --> 02:54:51,159
know test or just as far as testing

4177
02:54:48,879 --> 02:54:53,519
let me just finish my car analogy I

4178
02:54:51,159 --> 02:54:57,520
think I think it's funny so how you

4179
02:54:53,520 --> 02:54:59,880
drive your car is how you run your hplc

4180
02:54:57,520 --> 02:55:02,279
so if there's a road with a bunch of

4181
02:54:59,879 --> 02:55:04,879
potholes in it you ever drive down it

4182
02:55:02,279 --> 02:55:06,880
really fast and you hardly hit any

4183
02:55:04,879 --> 02:55:09,159
potholes at all right because you're

4184
02:55:06,879 --> 02:55:11,238
driving down so fast that you never hit

4185
02:55:09,159 --> 02:55:14,398
any of the but when you drive really

4186
02:55:11,238 --> 02:55:18,478
slow you hit every every [ __ ] pothole

4187
02:55:14,398 --> 02:55:21,478
right that's a beautiful analogy

4188
02:55:18,478 --> 02:55:24,079
my point of um Mark it's like having

4189
02:55:21,478 --> 02:55:26,879
this awesome instrument here and not

4190
02:55:24,079 --> 02:55:29,079
being able to know what it sounds

4191
02:55:26,879 --> 02:55:31,519
like you know what I mean I'm like it

4192
02:55:29,079 --> 02:55:33,039
just it looks so good and it's I know

4193
02:55:31,520 --> 02:55:34,720
what I'm playing I know I'm playing the

4194
02:55:33,040 --> 02:55:37,840
right chords and the right in the right

4195
02:55:34,719 --> 02:55:39,879
key and I know exactly what's what's I

4196
02:55:37,840 --> 02:55:43,079
think what's happening but you're

4197
02:55:39,879 --> 02:55:45,438
missing that call and response that um

4198
02:55:43,079 --> 02:55:48,559
as a formulator as a product developer

4199
02:55:45,439 --> 02:55:51,520
and a hash maker I I just I yearn for

4200
02:55:48,559 --> 02:55:54,119
that immediacy because that to me is the

4201
02:55:51,520 --> 02:55:57,399
art and that call and response is

4202
02:55:54,120 --> 02:56:00,000
necessary for myself to really make

4203
02:55:57,398 --> 02:56:03,119
decision making that's actually educated

4204
02:56:00,000 --> 02:56:04,840
rather than waiting around I wait around

4205
02:56:03,120 --> 02:56:07,680
I mean I've

4206
02:56:04,840 --> 02:56:09,880
waited waited long times guys like

4207
02:56:07,680 --> 02:56:12,040
months where to just be like well where

4208
02:56:09,879 --> 02:56:14,159
is the sample this stuff it's just been

4209
02:56:12,040 --> 02:56:16,040
sitting on ice for me essentially it's a

4210
02:56:14,159 --> 02:56:18,359
hurry up and weight situation in in the

4211
02:56:16,040 --> 02:56:19,720
regulated market sometimes and it's it

4212
02:56:18,359 --> 02:56:22,159
becomes actually

4213
02:56:19,719 --> 02:56:24,799
frustrating I think and to your point

4214
02:56:22,159 --> 02:56:26,478
mark yeah if you're constantly throwing

4215
02:56:24,799 --> 02:56:28,719
things over the over the fence you're

4216
02:56:26,478 --> 02:56:32,278
just it's h you're at the mercy of of

4217
02:56:28,719 --> 02:56:34,398
them so it's yeah and yeah really I

4218
02:56:32,279 --> 02:56:36,079
couldn't agree more I and I apologize

4219
02:56:34,398 --> 02:56:38,799
for any Interruption there um no don't

4220
02:56:36,079 --> 02:56:40,879
don't be never apologize I I appre I

4221
02:56:38,799 --> 02:56:42,318
appreciate these these points you know

4222
02:56:40,879 --> 02:56:44,679
and you know I think so much of the

4223
02:56:42,318 --> 02:56:46,398
foundation though is quality analytics

4224
02:56:44,680 --> 02:56:49,680
and and to actually do the work to learn

4225
02:56:46,398 --> 02:56:52,398
how to drive um or or to to play that

4226
02:56:49,680 --> 02:56:53,840
instrument you know and and uh and what

4227
02:56:52,398 --> 02:56:55,680
and I was going to hit on two points one

4228
02:56:53,840 --> 02:56:57,040
around kind of internal testing and then

4229
02:56:55,680 --> 02:56:58,398
the other one on kind of third party

4230
02:56:57,040 --> 02:57:00,479
testing because you know if you're going

4231
02:56:58,398 --> 02:57:03,318
to put people through so much

4232
02:57:00,478 --> 02:57:05,278
regulations and burdensome testing you

4233
02:57:03,318 --> 02:57:07,278
know for third party certification to

4234
02:57:05,279 --> 02:57:09,319
ensure for public health and safety you

4235
02:57:07,279 --> 02:57:11,079
know you have to be overly regulating

4236
02:57:09,318 --> 02:57:12,799
the analytical labs doing the testing

4237
02:57:11,079 --> 02:57:15,439
because if you don't have you know

4238
02:57:12,799 --> 02:57:17,759
substantial kind of auditing and ongoing

4239
02:57:15,439 --> 02:57:19,439
data package review processes from the

4240
02:57:17,760 --> 02:57:21,880
regulat body on the labs doing the

4241
02:57:19,439 --> 02:57:23,439
testing you know then then there's no

4242
02:57:21,879 --> 02:57:25,278
point in even having testing regulations

4243
02:57:23,439 --> 02:57:27,279
on people because if Labs aren't held to

4244
02:57:25,279 --> 02:57:28,920
a certain standard and you know they can

4245
02:57:27,279 --> 02:57:30,880
just you know and people know you know

4246
02:57:28,920 --> 02:57:32,520
there there becomes an economic dis to

4247
02:57:30,879 --> 02:57:34,559
work with good labs for good reasons of

4248
02:57:32,520 --> 02:57:37,079
accuracy and precision you know to more

4249
02:57:34,559 --> 02:57:38,439
chase out high THC numbers or to just

4250
02:57:37,079 --> 02:57:40,879
always go through these Labs because

4251
02:57:38,439 --> 02:57:42,600
they would pass you know but you know

4252
02:57:40,879 --> 02:57:44,719
kind of as an example just with turpine

4253
02:57:42,600 --> 02:57:46,960
testing you know um whenever we run a

4254
02:57:44,719 --> 02:57:49,159
turpine test or a GC you know it go go

4255
02:57:46,959 --> 02:57:51,679
you know the runtime through our column

4256
02:57:49,159 --> 02:57:53,238
is about 90 minutes per example you know

4257
02:57:51,680 --> 02:57:55,920
so that we can ensure that there's full

4258
02:57:53,238 --> 02:57:58,199
separation for every individual Peak

4259
02:57:55,920 --> 02:58:00,760
because if you if you if you rush it and

4260
02:57:58,200 --> 02:58:02,159
you have the 15 minute run time because

4261
02:58:00,760 --> 02:58:04,600
you're trying to do this High throughput

4262
02:58:02,159 --> 02:58:06,238
thing then you can see it in the data

4263
02:58:04,600 --> 02:58:08,800
being completely wrong because of the

4264
02:58:06,238 --> 02:58:11,318
ident misidentification of co- alluding

4265
02:58:08,799 --> 02:58:13,199
compounds that you know you identify as

4266
02:58:11,318 --> 02:58:15,639
eucalyptol or something that's not even

4267
02:58:13,200 --> 02:58:17,279
ever showing up in any substantial

4268
02:58:15,639 --> 02:58:19,000
amount in cannabis and so I think you

4269
02:58:17,279 --> 02:58:21,800
know the foundation of

4270
02:58:19,000 --> 02:58:23,920
of good chemistry good science good

4271
02:58:21,799 --> 02:58:25,599
analytical chemistry is is is doing the

4272
02:58:23,920 --> 02:58:27,238
work and validation to ensure that

4273
02:58:25,600 --> 02:58:29,960
you're actually test identifying what

4274
02:58:27,238 --> 02:58:32,279
you're looking to test you know and and

4275
02:58:29,959 --> 02:58:34,478
you know I completely agree I think I

4276
02:58:32,279 --> 02:58:37,238
think the partnership between you know

4277
02:58:34,478 --> 02:58:38,519
um thirdparty Labs like ourself and and

4278
02:58:37,238 --> 02:58:40,719
those that are in cultivation or

4279
02:58:38,520 --> 02:58:42,319
manufacturing is you know especially as

4280
02:58:40,719 --> 02:58:44,879
as groups are bringing on their own

4281
02:58:42,318 --> 02:58:46,079
internal hplc and GC capabilities it's

4282
02:58:44,879 --> 02:58:48,519
to develop that relationship and

4283
02:58:46,079 --> 02:58:50,680
partnership and helping to you know in

4284
02:58:48,520 --> 02:58:53,319
in you know show that we're you know the

4285
02:58:50,680 --> 02:58:53,318
same

4286
02:58:57,879 --> 02:59:02,679
page uh third third party testing Labs

4287
02:59:00,920 --> 02:59:03,920
but also individual groups setting up

4288
02:59:02,680 --> 02:59:07,120
Labs because you know if you're

4289
02:59:03,920 --> 02:59:08,639
formulating off of a bad method um you

4290
02:59:07,120 --> 02:59:11,560
know then then you're then you know

4291
02:59:08,639 --> 02:59:13,840
there's no ability to be consistent

4292
02:59:11,559 --> 02:59:16,478
or in comparing that to third party

4293
02:59:13,840 --> 02:59:18,600
testing yeah like to your point that

4294
02:59:16,478 --> 02:59:20,398
that you just made right there the

4295
02:59:18,600 --> 02:59:23,279
the differentiation from batch to batch

4296
02:59:20,398 --> 02:59:25,358
or the same batch tested unknowingly to

4297
02:59:23,279 --> 02:59:27,520
them or maybe they do know because it's

4298
02:59:25,359 --> 02:59:29,279
batch number related but they do come

4299
02:59:27,520 --> 02:59:32,680
back differently at times and we've

4300
02:59:29,279 --> 02:59:34,159
addressed that um and yeah think good

4301
02:59:32,680 --> 02:59:36,720
things take time and that's the other

4302
02:59:34,159 --> 02:59:40,680
half of it is that you're illustrating

4303
02:59:36,719 --> 02:59:43,278
the the most the biggest point it's it's

4304
02:59:40,680 --> 02:59:45,880
it's I take a lot of time in Minecraft

4305
02:59:43,279 --> 02:59:48,279
and and doing what they're doing in in

4306
02:59:45,879 --> 02:59:49,879
the lab that's the same way if you cut C

4307
02:59:48,279 --> 02:59:52,238
Corners you're going to see in the data

4308
02:59:49,879 --> 02:59:53,719
and that's you're exactly right and I

4309
02:59:52,238 --> 02:59:56,639
don't know what the answer to that stuff

4310
02:59:53,719 --> 02:59:58,599
is but it's you know I know from my

4311
02:59:56,639 --> 03:00:00,439
point of view because of all the

4312
02:59:58,600 --> 03:00:01,840
ceilings that we or the lower ceilings

4313
03:00:00,439 --> 03:00:05,040
that we have in the particular state

4314
03:00:01,840 --> 03:00:08,359
that I'm in in our facility it's just it

4315
03:00:05,040 --> 03:00:10,279
it becomes um I just want things faster

4316
03:00:08,359 --> 03:00:13,520
I'm it's only human though I guess you

4317
03:00:10,279 --> 03:00:16,319
know um so I think it's it's good that

4318
03:00:13,520 --> 03:00:18,520
we can push labs to to to think about

4319
03:00:16,318 --> 03:00:22,000
this but to your point what there's a

4320
03:00:18,520 --> 03:00:23,439
give and take um yeah and you know in

4321
03:00:22,000 --> 03:00:25,359
California for compliance testing you

4322
03:00:23,439 --> 03:00:27,120
know we're at two to three days so I

4323
03:00:25,359 --> 03:00:31,200
mean you shouldn't you should never you

4324
03:00:27,120 --> 03:00:34,800
know be satisfied with 30 days you know

4325
03:00:31,200 --> 03:00:37,200
and see I would I would be happy to get

4326
03:00:34,799 --> 03:00:39,438
there that would be

4327
03:00:37,200 --> 03:00:41,600
incredible and you know it's taken us

4328
03:00:39,439 --> 03:00:43,720
long time to get to that but um you know

4329
03:00:41,600 --> 03:00:44,960
but but to the Quality uh conversation

4330
03:00:43,719 --> 03:00:46,840
that's where I think California you I

4331
03:00:44,959 --> 03:00:49,358
think a lot of states that have

4332
03:00:46,840 --> 03:00:51,719
regulated in the past haven't taken

4333
03:00:49,359 --> 03:00:53,600
haven't done their job of regulating

4334
03:00:51,719 --> 03:00:55,278
labs to they should be and so what

4335
03:00:53,600 --> 03:00:57,200
happens in California you know

4336
03:00:55,279 --> 03:00:59,200
eventually as every lab is fully

4337
03:00:57,200 --> 03:01:01,479
licensed no lab has their full license

4338
03:00:59,200 --> 03:01:04,760
currently you know every lab that's

4339
03:01:01,478 --> 03:01:08,398
currently uh licensed is operating on

4340
03:01:04,760 --> 03:01:10,000
provisional license at most and and um

4341
03:01:08,398 --> 03:01:12,959
by the end of the regulation there's so

4342
03:01:10,000 --> 03:01:14,799
much ongoing auditing accreditation and

4343
03:01:12,959 --> 03:01:17,039
and the be the Bureau of cannabis

4344
03:01:14,799 --> 03:01:18,639
control in California has this process

4345
03:01:17,040 --> 03:01:21,920
known as data pack

4346
03:01:18,639 --> 03:01:23,478
review um and so at any time the BCC can

4347
03:01:21,920 --> 03:01:26,000
reach out to a lab and they they come

4348
03:01:23,478 --> 03:01:28,639
from client driven complaints on uh in

4349
03:01:26,000 --> 03:01:30,639
consistency and quality or from just

4350
03:01:28,639 --> 03:01:32,840
random audit but they'll request a data

4351
03:01:30,639 --> 03:01:34,358
package it's about 12 gigabytes of data

4352
03:01:32,840 --> 03:01:37,279
the lab has to get to them by the end of

4353
03:01:34,359 --> 03:01:39,159
the following day and so and and it's

4354
03:01:37,279 --> 03:01:41,760
all the calibration data quality data

4355
03:01:39,159 --> 03:01:43,719
who touched it went every aspect of of

4356
03:01:41,760 --> 03:01:45,880
uh the of every test that was done on

4357
03:01:43,719 --> 03:01:48,238
that batch and then the BCC has a panel

4358
03:01:45,879 --> 03:01:49,799
of PhD analytical chemists then

4359
03:01:48,238 --> 03:01:52,079
essentially grade these data packages

4360
03:01:49,799 --> 03:01:54,398
and review and you know and and

4361
03:01:52,079 --> 03:01:56,318
scrutinize these data packages and if

4362
03:01:54,398 --> 03:01:58,119
they see any issue with the data they'll

4363
03:01:56,318 --> 03:01:59,840
reach out to the lab you have to the end

4364
03:01:58,120 --> 03:02:01,239
they'll ask you a question and you have

4365
03:01:59,840 --> 03:02:03,398
to the end of that day at four in the

4366
03:02:01,238 --> 03:02:04,639
afternoon to answer that question and

4367
03:02:03,398 --> 03:02:05,799
based on your ability to answer the

4368
03:02:04,639 --> 03:02:08,398
question they'll either say all right

4369
03:02:05,799 --> 03:02:10,599
cool you're good or they'll initiate an

4370
03:02:08,398 --> 03:02:12,000
investigation and so once they initiate

4371
03:02:10,600 --> 03:02:14,000
investigation they begin doing deeper

4372
03:02:12,000 --> 03:02:16,478
Dives and auditing you know the lab's

4373
03:02:14,000 --> 03:02:19,478
Quality Systems and uh different batches

4374
03:02:16,478 --> 03:02:21,318
of data and from uh their findings they

4375
03:02:19,478 --> 03:02:23,599
they'll issue a tier tier two or tier

4376
03:02:21,318 --> 03:02:26,359
three violation tier one's like a fix it

4377
03:02:23,600 --> 03:02:28,120
ticket tier two is a suspension and

4378
03:02:26,359 --> 03:02:29,920
ended there's you know I mean lab has

4379
03:02:28,120 --> 03:02:31,000
been suspended for five six weeks you

4380
03:02:29,920 --> 03:02:33,520
know currently in the state of

4381
03:02:31,000 --> 03:02:35,120
California from this type of uh you know

4382
03:02:33,520 --> 03:02:37,479
and and you know and then the top tier

4383
03:02:35,120 --> 03:02:39,040
violation is a tier three violation and

4384
03:02:37,478 --> 03:02:40,519
that's like um identifying you know

4385
03:02:39,040 --> 03:02:42,520
because tier two violation you're

4386
03:02:40,520 --> 03:02:43,880
suspended until the until you can

4387
03:02:42,520 --> 03:02:45,800
demonstrate to the BCC that you

4388
03:02:43,879 --> 03:02:47,839
corrected the action that they found a

4389
03:02:45,799 --> 03:02:49,559
violation in you know in the quality of

4390
03:02:47,840 --> 03:02:52,439
data and the method development or

4391
03:02:49,559 --> 03:02:55,278
validation um you know and and um and

4392
03:02:52,439 --> 03:02:57,159
then so so tier 2 is a suspension for

4393
03:02:55,279 --> 03:02:58,720
however long it takes to fix the

4394
03:02:57,159 --> 03:03:00,398
violation and then a tier three

4395
03:02:58,719 --> 03:03:01,639
violation has happened to you know

4396
03:03:00,398 --> 03:03:03,680
probably about 10 Labs already in

4397
03:03:01,639 --> 03:03:05,199
California and that's a full revocation

4398
03:03:03,680 --> 03:03:07,840
of license because they found

4399
03:03:05,200 --> 03:03:09,640
fraudulence or gross negligence you know

4400
03:03:07,840 --> 03:03:11,680
just juicing numbers like you know kind

4401
03:03:09,639 --> 03:03:13,719
of tweaking their methods to never see

4402
03:03:11,680 --> 03:03:15,439
pesticides and whenever the tier three

4403
03:03:13,719 --> 03:03:17,959
violation happens know they essentially

4404
03:03:15,439 --> 03:03:19,600
do a consumer level product recall going

4405
03:03:17,959 --> 03:03:22,119
back to the beginning of the date of the

4406
03:03:19,600 --> 03:03:23,680
investigation began and uh you know

4407
03:03:22,120 --> 03:03:26,040
there's a few labs in California that

4408
03:03:23,680 --> 03:03:28,079
happened to and the the most horrifying

4409
03:03:26,040 --> 03:03:29,800
part of it is you know the the producers

4410
03:03:28,079 --> 03:03:31,559
and processors and manufacturers of

4411
03:03:29,799 --> 03:03:33,079
batches are the ones that take the

4412
03:03:31,559 --> 03:03:34,799
biggest hit in those cases because they

4413
03:03:33,079 --> 03:03:36,318
have to go through these product recalls

4414
03:03:34,799 --> 03:03:38,079
after they already you know got cashed

4415
03:03:36,318 --> 03:03:40,000
out you know you know counted on you

4416
03:03:38,079 --> 03:03:41,120
know you know invested their money back

4417
03:03:40,000 --> 03:03:44,000
into their business you know all of a

4418
03:03:41,120 --> 03:03:45,960
sudden product recall and so you know we

4419
03:03:44,000 --> 03:03:48,600
we really pride ourselves in kind of you

4420
03:03:45,959 --> 03:03:51,719
know working to be a leader in the

4421
03:03:48,600 --> 03:03:53,340
leader in in the space of what we do um

4422
03:03:51,719 --> 03:03:56,418
and and

4423
03:03:53,340 --> 03:03:56,418
[Music]

4424
03:03:59,920 --> 03:04:05,680
and testing regulations as know spot not

4425
03:04:04,318 --> 03:04:09,000
just because we're in the business of

4426
03:04:05,680 --> 03:04:11,479
testing but as a cultural um you know on

4427
03:04:09,000 --> 03:04:12,719
a cultural kind of uh sociological level

4428
03:04:11,478 --> 03:04:13,840
you know we see you know testing as a

4429
03:04:12,719 --> 03:04:14,599
way of evening the playing field again

4430
03:04:13,840 --> 03:04:16,960
back to the other part of the

4431
03:04:14,600 --> 03:04:19,479
conversation where you know if everybody

4432
03:04:16,959 --> 03:04:21,159
is on the same account held you know

4433
03:04:19,478 --> 03:04:23,438
there you know it's David can complete

4434
03:04:21,159 --> 03:04:25,079
comp against Goliath and um and then

4435
03:04:23,439 --> 03:04:27,359
once we're all on the same level of

4436
03:04:25,079 --> 03:04:29,238
quality and data you know then then you

4437
03:04:27,359 --> 03:04:30,720
we can begin to actually you know really

4438
03:04:29,238 --> 03:04:33,039
help people tune their methods and their

4439
03:04:30,719 --> 03:04:36,519
internal labs and kind of you know the

4440
03:04:33,040 --> 03:04:39,200
whole industry can progress um but yeah

4441
03:04:36,520 --> 03:04:42,120
what's your take on Tac uh do do you

4442
03:04:39,200 --> 03:04:43,840
mark Dr Mark and and also you Alec uh

4443
03:04:42,120 --> 03:04:46,960
and everyone here what do you what do

4444
03:04:43,840 --> 03:04:48,600
you guys feel T what do you mean by Tac

4445
03:04:46,959 --> 03:04:52,039
well you know how Market is really

4446
03:04:48,600 --> 03:04:58,600
looking at Tac as a as a mechanism in in

4447
03:04:52,040 --> 03:05:00,200
retail um 30% the 20% Club it's the you

4448
03:04:58,600 --> 03:05:02,359
know the these types of terms that are

4449
03:05:00,200 --> 03:05:04,600
being have been historically thrown

4450
03:05:02,359 --> 03:05:06,399
around you know what do you think they

4451
03:05:04,600 --> 03:05:08,680
mean in terms of of science I'm not

4452
03:05:06,398 --> 03:05:11,920
familiar I've never heard of ATT before

4453
03:05:08,680 --> 03:05:11,920
at all total active

4454
03:05:12,120 --> 03:05:17,800
canids canids Okay

4455
03:05:14,879 --> 03:05:20,000
total sure sure yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

4456
03:05:17,799 --> 03:05:21,879
okay yeah well I mean yeah to I mean

4457
03:05:20,000 --> 03:05:23,680
because you know I mean I think that's

4458
03:05:21,879 --> 03:05:26,278
that's the whole thing thing I mean

4459
03:05:23,680 --> 03:05:30,079
everybody been so focused hyperfocused

4460
03:05:26,279 --> 03:05:31,439
on THC in regulated markets as the sole

4461
03:05:30,079 --> 03:05:32,799
indicator of quality and it's really had

4462
03:05:31,439 --> 03:05:34,439
an effect on the market in a huge way

4463
03:05:32,799 --> 03:05:35,639
not only because Bad Lab data exists

4464
03:05:34,439 --> 03:05:37,639
where numbers are just Juiced and it

4465
03:05:35,639 --> 03:05:40,639
just throws off the whole thing but also

4466
03:05:37,639 --> 03:05:42,559
because you know I mean when I think Tac

4467
03:05:40,639 --> 03:05:44,760
combined with total tping content and

4468
03:05:42,559 --> 03:05:46,159
the relative ratio is really one of the

4469
03:05:44,760 --> 03:05:48,000
best numbers you could ever judge or

4470
03:05:46,159 --> 03:05:50,680
value weed on right because you could

4471
03:05:48,000 --> 03:05:52,719
have a you know 30% t total active

4472
03:05:50,680 --> 03:05:54,760
cannabinoid you know kind of containing

4473
03:05:52,719 --> 03:05:56,799
strain but if you had less if you know

4474
03:05:54,760 --> 03:05:59,520
if you dried it and cured it like you

4475
03:05:56,799 --> 03:06:01,719
know terribly and you volatilized all

4476
03:05:59,520 --> 03:06:04,159
your monot turps you could have say less

4477
03:06:01,719 --> 03:06:07,278
than 0.2% total turpine content so now

4478
03:06:04,159 --> 03:06:10,879
you got 35 canab or 3% total canab total

4479
03:06:07,279 --> 03:06:13,640
cannabinoids you got less than 0 2% tpin

4480
03:06:10,879 --> 03:06:15,679
that's like a 90 to1 95 to1 cannaboid

4481
03:06:13,639 --> 03:06:17,680
detering ratio and in my opinion that's

4482
03:06:15,680 --> 03:06:19,720
what really begins to Define what bio

4483
03:06:17,680 --> 03:06:21,880
masses everybody's using that word in my

4484
03:06:19,719 --> 03:06:23,079
opinion biomass is when material that

4485
03:06:21,879 --> 03:06:25,839
has no other

4486
03:06:23,079 --> 03:06:28,879
value because the turpins are gone or

4487
03:06:25,840 --> 03:06:31,398
it's old or degraded to where then dis

4488
03:06:28,879 --> 03:06:33,398
distilling it is the only real option to

4489
03:06:31,398 --> 03:06:35,159
capture value from that material whereas

4490
03:06:33,398 --> 03:06:37,760
if there's a bunch of tpine content

4491
03:06:35,159 --> 03:06:39,039
because preservation and ongoing like

4492
03:06:37,760 --> 03:06:41,680
you know because you know a lot of

4493
03:06:39,040 --> 03:06:43,880
people are farming cannabis but not tpin

4494
03:06:41,680 --> 03:06:45,800
right and and you know we see from the

4495
03:06:43,879 --> 03:06:48,278
time of harvest even if you dry and cure

4496
03:06:45,799 --> 03:06:50,879
in the most ideal condition

4497
03:06:48,279 --> 03:06:53,120
you know you there's 60 to 80% of tpping

4498
03:06:50,879 --> 03:06:54,799
content lost you know so I if you

4499
03:06:53,120 --> 03:06:56,880
harvest in the middle of the day versus

4500
03:06:54,799 --> 03:06:58,398
of the night you know by going to field

4501
03:06:56,879 --> 03:07:00,119
harvesting in the middle of the heat of

4502
03:06:58,398 --> 03:07:01,799
the day you smell turpins in the air

4503
03:07:00,120 --> 03:07:04,040
they volatilized into your nose right

4504
03:07:01,799 --> 03:07:05,639
and so I think you know and and and and

4505
03:07:04,040 --> 03:07:07,880
so going back to that analogy right if

4506
03:07:05,639 --> 03:07:10,799
you had a if you had a strain that was

4507
03:07:07,879 --> 03:07:13,079
15% total active cannabinoids when

4508
03:07:10,799 --> 03:07:15,959
unfortunately and these regulated

4509
03:07:13,079 --> 03:07:18,559
licensed legalized markets you know can

4510
03:07:15,959 --> 03:07:20,839
can have uh deflated value because

4511
03:07:18,559 --> 03:07:24,478
they're not above 20% right if it was

4512
03:07:20,840 --> 03:07:27,760
15% but it had like but if it was Harve

4513
03:07:24,478 --> 03:07:29,000
if it was cultivated optimally harvested

4514
03:07:27,760 --> 03:07:31,238
in the middle of the night around the

4515
03:07:29,000 --> 03:07:33,159
full moon um you know dried cured

4516
03:07:31,238 --> 03:07:35,520
preserved under like ideal conditions

4517
03:07:33,159 --> 03:07:37,879
below 60 degrees you know or or more

4518
03:07:35,520 --> 03:07:40,238
whatever you know like the you you know

4519
03:07:37,879 --> 03:07:42,879
you can see that in the relative ratio

4520
03:07:40,238 --> 03:07:44,398
of canab cannaboids the tping and so all

4521
03:07:42,879 --> 03:07:47,238
of a sudden you you could have three and

4522
03:07:44,398 --> 03:07:50,039
a half to 5 and a half% tpine content in

4523
03:07:47,238 --> 03:07:52,520
the dried flour relative to 15%

4524
03:07:50,040 --> 03:07:54,439
cannaboids that's like a 3:1 cannaboid

4525
03:07:52,520 --> 03:07:56,600
deter ratio you know so so all of a

4526
03:07:54,439 --> 03:07:58,760
sudden reality of the Entourage effect

4527
03:07:56,600 --> 03:08:00,520
or The Ensemble effect and how much the

4528
03:07:58,760 --> 03:08:03,478
the effect is going to hit you know

4529
03:08:00,520 --> 03:08:05,640
because the lining is 3% and versus you

4530
03:08:03,478 --> 03:08:07,199
know half a percent right so I think

4531
03:08:05,639 --> 03:08:09,119
there's something really big there in

4532
03:08:07,200 --> 03:08:11,279
the future you know because it's it's

4533
03:08:09,120 --> 03:08:13,319
it's you know paying Les less I mean

4534
03:08:11,279 --> 03:08:16,120
total active cannaboids I think is much

4535
03:08:13,318 --> 03:08:18,439
more important than total you know THC

4536
03:08:16,120 --> 03:08:20,040
you know right because what other canabo

4537
03:08:18,439 --> 03:08:23,479
are in there and what amounts right but

4538
03:08:20,040 --> 03:08:26,359
but total act canono in relation to

4539
03:08:23,478 --> 03:08:28,199
Total tpine content the relative ratio

4540
03:08:26,359 --> 03:08:30,200
that's like a that's more of a measure

4541
03:08:28,200 --> 03:08:32,960
to actually judge so what is your what's

4542
03:08:30,200 --> 03:08:36,760
a good measurement for you that you see

4543
03:08:32,959 --> 03:08:38,599
in terms of tpin um you know I mean we

4544
03:08:36,760 --> 03:08:40,680
see like anything I think you see so

4545
03:08:38,600 --> 03:08:42,200
much that's why I'm asking I just I feel

4546
03:08:40,680 --> 03:08:44,840
like it's good for the viewers and even

4547
03:08:42,200 --> 03:08:46,880
myself to you know because we we've

4548
03:08:44,840 --> 03:08:48,238
arrived in this regulated market we have

4549
03:08:46,879 --> 03:08:49,879
a lot of

4550
03:08:48,238 --> 03:08:52,600
terms and things that are being thrown

4551
03:08:49,879 --> 03:08:54,920
around every day and it all amounts to

4552
03:08:52,600 --> 03:08:57,318
Art and commerce to me at least at the

4553
03:08:54,920 --> 03:09:00,398
end of the day and how they quantify

4554
03:08:57,318 --> 03:09:02,600
that is just so op it's there's a lot of

4555
03:09:00,398 --> 03:09:07,079
opinion around

4556
03:09:02,600 --> 03:09:09,399
it well uh so we can thank we can thank

4557
03:09:07,079 --> 03:09:11,398
our friends in Italy again for helping

4558
03:09:09,398 --> 03:09:14,000
another piece of the puzzle become

4559
03:09:11,398 --> 03:09:18,920
unraveled right so not only did they

4560
03:09:14,000 --> 03:09:20,478
discover the the the T8 CP and the

4561
03:09:18,920 --> 03:09:23,559
cbdp

4562
03:09:20,478 --> 03:09:26,760
C7 cannabinoids so they've now

4563
03:09:23,559 --> 03:09:29,119
discovered the C6 cannabinoids right and

4564
03:09:26,760 --> 03:09:31,478
I posted the link in our chat Marcus I

4565
03:09:29,120 --> 03:09:34,319
don't think I can't post it over in the

4566
03:09:31,478 --> 03:09:35,840
in the um I can try to do it right now

4567
03:09:34,318 --> 03:09:38,760
in the YouTube chat if you guys want to

4568
03:09:35,840 --> 03:09:40,639
put that in there but so so this is the

4569
03:09:38,760 --> 03:09:43,680
this is the cannabinoid structure but

4570
03:09:40,639 --> 03:09:47,039
rather than having the C5 tail it's got

4571
03:09:43,680 --> 03:09:49,960
a C6 tail so it makes sense that you

4572
03:09:47,040 --> 03:09:51,680
know all of these things are in the

4573
03:09:49,959 --> 03:09:56,599
Cannabis that we've been smoking for

4574
03:09:51,680 --> 03:10:01,439
years the C6 the C3 or the varens the

4575
03:09:56,600 --> 03:10:05,720
C7 are the P's and the c5s are the ones

4576
03:10:01,439 --> 03:10:09,279
that were you know analyzing routinely

4577
03:10:05,719 --> 03:10:13,079
but constantly finding that we're not

4578
03:10:09,279 --> 03:10:16,040
characterizing the full amount of what

4579
03:10:13,079 --> 03:10:19,318
we have well you know these are all the

4580
03:10:16,040 --> 03:10:19,319
little pieces that are

4581
03:10:19,600 --> 03:10:24,640
you you're saying that these compounds

4582
03:10:21,879 --> 03:10:26,438
are affecting the high I doubt it the

4583
03:10:24,639 --> 03:10:28,719
found it I I didn't say they're

4584
03:10:26,439 --> 03:10:31,398
affecting the high who said that I

4585
03:10:28,719 --> 03:10:34,079
didn't say they're affecting the high oh

4586
03:10:31,398 --> 03:10:36,680
okay I misunderstood good thing because

4587
03:10:34,079 --> 03:10:38,760
he doesn't agree with that well well

4588
03:10:36,680 --> 03:10:40,720
wait wait this group of Italian this

4589
03:10:38,760 --> 03:10:44,318
group of Italians did show that the

4590
03:10:40,719 --> 03:10:49,760
compounds are active I think in a mouse

4591
03:10:44,318 --> 03:10:52,278
uh paw pain assay for no Ive uh uh pain

4592
03:10:49,760 --> 03:10:54,559
I I I read the paper really quickly but

4593
03:10:52,279 --> 03:10:57,439
um it's just another again it's

4594
03:10:54,559 --> 03:10:59,760
fascinating because as analytical

4595
03:10:57,439 --> 03:11:02,318
chemistry is happening and as varieties

4596
03:10:59,760 --> 03:11:05,159
I think if I remember correctly the name

4597
03:11:02,318 --> 03:11:07,318
of the variety was the fm2 if you look

4598
03:11:05,159 --> 03:11:09,039
at the paper in nature and I think the

4599
03:11:07,318 --> 03:11:11,600
paper is widely available it's not like

4600
03:11:09,040 --> 03:11:13,160
you need some subscription to a journal

4601
03:11:11,600 --> 03:11:15,359
so all you need to do is click on that

4602
03:11:13,159 --> 03:11:18,879
link but you'll see that they have the

4603
03:11:15,359 --> 03:11:21,720
CBD version and THC version that they

4604
03:11:18,879 --> 03:11:24,759
isolated in very very small quantities

4605
03:11:21,719 --> 03:11:27,318
but it's just Again part of what the

4606
03:11:24,760 --> 03:11:29,318
plant is making the plants making these

4607
03:11:27,318 --> 03:11:32,519
compounds that totally makes sense that

4608
03:11:29,318 --> 03:11:34,840
the biosynthetic pathway exists and the

4609
03:11:32,520 --> 03:11:37,920
thing I'll leave everyone with is that

4610
03:11:34,840 --> 03:11:41,040
now that they've basically been able to

4611
03:11:37,920 --> 03:11:43,680
make cannaboids in yeast they can now

4612
03:11:41,040 --> 03:11:46,720
genetically engineer yeast just to make

4613
03:11:43,680 --> 03:11:49,920
specifically now this one with the C6

4614
03:11:46,719 --> 03:11:52,039
tail or with the C3 tail and then

4615
03:11:49,920 --> 03:11:54,639
combine them later on so you know you're

4616
03:11:52,040 --> 03:11:56,680
not limited by just plant genetics

4617
03:11:54,639 --> 03:11:59,199
because you know they know the

4618
03:11:56,680 --> 03:12:03,359
biochemical mechanisms and how to

4619
03:11:59,200 --> 03:12:03,359
basically engineer yeast to make these

4620
03:12:04,000 --> 03:12:08,359
compounds how valuable do you think

4621
03:12:06,040 --> 03:12:10,399
that's going to be longterm Mark oh I

4622
03:12:08,359 --> 03:12:12,640
think it's really valuable I think the

4623
03:12:10,398 --> 03:12:14,959
yeah I it's incredibly valuable these

4624
03:12:12,639 --> 03:12:18,079
compounds are incredibly medically

4625
03:12:14,959 --> 03:12:21,000
active and making small subtle changes

4626
03:12:18,079 --> 03:12:23,680
to the structure seems to have impact on

4627
03:12:21,000 --> 03:12:25,920
the biological activity so I think those

4628
03:12:23,680 --> 03:12:30,359
small subtle changes to the structure

4629
03:12:25,920 --> 03:12:32,920
just even if you compare t8c to T8 CV or

4630
03:12:30,359 --> 03:12:37,399
if you compare the C the ones in the

4631
03:12:32,920 --> 03:12:39,760
CBD um uh uh a family I mean all of

4632
03:12:37,398 --> 03:12:41,879
these compounds basically are active in

4633
03:12:39,760 --> 03:12:45,559
the same way the question is is what do

4634
03:12:41,879 --> 03:12:47,719
the subtle changes in the structures do

4635
03:12:45,559 --> 03:12:50,238
impact their safety and efficacy and I

4636
03:12:47,719 --> 03:12:54,679
think for the most part that's widely

4637
03:12:50,238 --> 03:12:54,680
unknown so an open field worth

4638
03:12:57,680 --> 03:13:03,880
study right no absolutely I agree 100% I

4639
03:13:03,000 --> 03:13:06,760
would think

4640
03:13:03,879 --> 03:13:09,478
so I mean more stady more stady changing

4641
03:13:06,760 --> 03:13:11,520
in regulation yeah does invite all the

4642
03:13:09,478 --> 03:13:14,438
corporate aspects of this but it also

4643
03:13:11,520 --> 03:13:16,600
invites opportunity to uncover

4644
03:13:14,439 --> 03:13:19,040
incredible value propositions which is

4645
03:13:16,600 --> 03:13:21,720
that these molecules which you know the

4646
03:13:19,040 --> 03:13:23,840
plant has basically taught us are

4647
03:13:21,719 --> 03:13:26,478
biologically active and oh yeah by the

4648
03:13:23,840 --> 03:13:29,200
way they're also safe for humans have

4649
03:13:26,478 --> 03:13:32,159
all kinds of myriads of biological

4650
03:13:29,200 --> 03:13:35,840
properties that are you know we need to

4651
03:13:32,159 --> 03:13:38,959
discover and exploit in terms of you

4652
03:13:35,840 --> 03:13:41,639
know manifesting it for human health and

4653
03:13:38,959 --> 03:13:45,639
not taking all this pharmaceutical crap

4654
03:13:41,639 --> 03:13:45,639
that they're trying to sell us

4655
03:13:49,600 --> 03:13:52,359
yeah I've been really I've been I've

4656
03:13:50,959 --> 03:13:54,839
been really I've been really freaked out

4657
03:13:52,359 --> 03:13:56,200
about the Frank and canono you know kind

4658
03:13:54,840 --> 03:13:58,680
of future

4659
03:13:56,200 --> 03:14:01,319
idea Prevagen what the hell is in

4660
03:13:58,680 --> 03:14:03,600
Prevagen some ground up jellyfish

4661
03:14:01,318 --> 03:14:06,079
there's commercials on it all over TV I

4662
03:14:03,600 --> 03:14:09,399
see it on the Nightly News I see it all

4663
03:14:06,079 --> 03:14:11,639
during you know Prevagen it's like some

4664
03:14:09,398 --> 03:14:13,278
you know herbal supplement that old

4665
03:14:11,639 --> 03:14:15,278
people are taking and it says it

4666
03:14:13,279 --> 03:14:17,120
improves their memory I look at these

4667
03:14:15,279 --> 03:14:20,000
commercials I'm like why aren't these

4668
03:14:17,120 --> 03:14:22,000
people smok in the ganja it'll improve

4669
03:14:20,000 --> 03:14:23,359
their memory what the [ __ ] they don't

4670
03:14:22,000 --> 03:14:25,600
they don't want to say goodbye to the

4671
03:14:23,359 --> 03:14:29,040
anal leakage they get from their

4672
03:14:25,600 --> 03:14:31,800
pharmaceutical uh yeah but Prevagen is

4673
03:14:29,040 --> 03:14:34,279
totally not FDA regulated it's just

4674
03:14:31,799 --> 03:14:37,000
herbal flying under the radar of some

4675
03:14:34,279 --> 03:14:39,640
herbal supplement [ __ ] with some

4676
03:14:37,000 --> 03:14:41,920
nice you know you know whizbang

4677
03:14:39,639 --> 03:14:44,920
marketing it's snake oil for Christ

4678
03:14:41,920 --> 03:14:46,680
sakes they I mean again they say I don't

4679
03:14:44,920 --> 03:14:49,120
know it improves your memory they say a

4680
03:14:46,680 --> 03:14:52,520
key ingredient is derived from jellyfish

4681
03:14:49,120 --> 03:14:55,359
you know so it's interesting I don't

4682
03:14:52,520 --> 03:14:57,520
know just wondering you know stick to

4683
03:14:55,359 --> 03:15:00,000

Bitcoin he'll get you some yeah but what

4686
03:15:02,719 --> 03:15:08,599
about my Beaver anus I love my Beaver

4687
03:15:05,879 --> 03:15:10,759
anus I want I'm really

4688
03:15:08,600 --> 03:15:13,960
fascinated I'm I'm really fascinated too

4689
03:15:10,760 --> 03:15:16,398
with kind of uh um and you know and I'm

4690
03:15:13,959 --> 03:15:19,039
curious to Sam if you have any thoughts

4691
03:15:16,398 --> 03:15:21,318
on just uh you know cuz you know a lot

4692
03:15:19,040 --> 03:15:24,279
of in medicinal mushrooms like um you

4693
03:15:21,318 --> 03:15:25,478
know cabs chaga all the different you

4694
03:15:24,279 --> 03:15:27,479
know kind of medicinal mushrooms it

4695
03:15:25,478 --> 03:15:29,599
seems like there's TR they're TR Turpin

4696
03:15:27,478 --> 03:15:33,159
that are some of the major compounds

4697
03:15:29,600 --> 03:15:35,359
behind their medicinal values and so so

4698
03:15:33,159 --> 03:15:38,159
just this future of uh combining these

4699
03:15:35,359 --> 03:15:39,720
triterpenes with cannabinoids you know

4700
03:15:38,159 --> 03:15:41,840
and and you know whether you know there

4701
03:15:39,719 --> 03:15:44,119
might be some interesting unique kind of

4702
03:15:41,840 --> 03:15:46,318
you know shifting of you know the way

4703
03:15:44,120 --> 03:15:48,720
that cannabinoids or these tropin are

4704
03:15:46,318 --> 03:15:52,278
binding the or having effects on the

4705
03:15:48,719 --> 03:15:53,719
system um are you asking me that what

4706
03:15:52,279 --> 03:15:55,600
you what what you think about that is

4707
03:15:53,719 --> 03:15:59,039
that yes he is and you better have the

4708
03:15:55,600 --> 03:16:03,159
answer I hardly know what to say because

4709
03:15:59,040 --> 03:16:06,160
uh I never did any real science on you

4710
03:16:03,159 --> 03:16:09,398
know mushrooms cannabis together other

4711
03:16:06,159 --> 03:16:13,159
than you know personally enjoying both

4712
03:16:09,398 --> 03:16:17,119
but uh I I I really don't know what to

4713
03:16:13,159 --> 03:16:20,760
say well I'll go back to the

4714
03:16:17,120 --> 03:16:22,680
found in mushrooms whereas I've studied

4715
03:16:20,760 --> 03:16:25,800
them extensively we'll send you the

4716
03:16:22,680 --> 03:16:28,920
paper that Josh shared last hash Church

4717
03:16:25,799 --> 03:16:31,719
which is I downloaded that paper did did

4718
03:16:28,920 --> 03:16:34,318
you check it out no I didn't read it to

4719
03:16:31,719 --> 03:16:36,039
be honest want paper check it out I

4720
03:16:34,318 --> 03:16:38,879
think it'll pull you in it's called

4721
03:16:36,040 --> 03:16:41,040
traversing the fungal

4722
03:16:38,879 --> 03:16:43,238
terpenome I'd love to send it to you as

4723
03:16:41,040 --> 03:16:43,239
well

4724
03:16:43,559 --> 03:16:48,398
Alec it's a good one I again another

4725
03:16:46,520 --> 03:16:50,960
thing that I think the hippie and

4726
03:16:48,398 --> 03:16:56,719
Grateful Dead culture got right

4727
03:16:50,959 --> 03:17:00,799
psychedelics is uh a way to deliver your

4728
03:16:56,719 --> 03:17:04,398
mind uh from the oppression of what's

4729
03:17:00,799 --> 03:17:07,318
going on in your life and uh it's useful

4730
03:17:04,398 --> 03:17:09,760
for uh all kinds of folks that I know

4731
03:17:07,318 --> 03:17:12,680
who started going down and doing the

4732
03:17:09,760 --> 03:17:15,439
iasa down in South America who claimed

4733
03:17:12,680 --> 03:17:17,920
that it basically saved their lives that

4734
03:17:15,439 --> 03:17:20,238
they would not be alive today if they

4735
03:17:17,920 --> 03:17:23,120
didn't go down there two or three times

4736
03:17:20,238 --> 03:17:24,879
a year and have this experience and the

4737
03:17:23,120 --> 03:17:27,359
other thing I wanted to say is that man

4738
03:17:24,879 --> 03:17:29,719
isn't it just great to see kind of

4739
03:17:27,359 --> 03:17:31,840
psychedelics follow in the wake of

4740
03:17:29,719 --> 03:17:33,760
cannabis when you look at you know

4741
03:17:31,840 --> 03:17:36,719
policies that are being opened up and

4742
03:17:33,760 --> 03:17:38,478
say like Oregon and Denver where now you

4743
03:17:36,719 --> 03:17:40,559
start basically saying okay you know

4744
03:17:38,478 --> 03:17:42,959
what yeah everything's going to turn

4745
03:17:40,559 --> 03:17:46,879
into a big parking lot at a Grateful

4746
03:17:42,959 --> 03:17:48,679
Dead show I mean it it just it goes to

4747
03:17:46,879 --> 03:17:51,839
show you again you know I I don't know

4748
03:17:48,680 --> 03:17:54,960
if there is uh you know an equivalent to

4749
03:17:51,840 --> 03:17:57,000
like religion or what replaced religion

4750
03:17:54,959 --> 03:17:59,238
for a lot of people in their life but

4751
03:17:57,000 --> 03:18:01,959
whatever that experience was that

4752
03:17:59,238 --> 03:18:03,639
delivered them and the dudes who were

4753
03:18:01,959 --> 03:18:05,278
psyched all week they were going to see

4754
03:18:03,639 --> 03:18:07,318
The Grateful Dead Friday and they had a

4755
03:18:05,279 --> 03:18:09,199
bag of shrooms and then they ate those

4756
03:18:07,318 --> 03:18:12,639
shrooms and then Garcia and the boys

4757
03:18:09,199 --> 03:18:14,840
came on that was like a moment for that

4758
03:18:12,639 --> 03:18:17,119
guy you know well that was the Rapture

4759
03:18:14,840 --> 03:18:21,040
that was that was the true experience

4760
03:18:17,120 --> 03:18:24,279

4783
03:19:10,040 --> 03:19:13,600
at the definition of the word apocalypse

4784
03:19:11,680 --> 03:19:16,479
it's the time of Revelation or the great

4785
03:19:13,600 --> 03:19:18,600
unveiling and and on that idea time of

4786
03:19:16,478 --> 03:19:20,438
re of G veiling it kind of feels like

4787
03:19:18,600 --> 03:19:22,840
we're in that right now you know it

4788
03:19:20,439 --> 03:19:24,159
feels like and and and and Mark I love

4789
03:19:22,840 --> 03:19:25,238
what you're were talking about with

4790
03:19:24,159 --> 03:19:26,719
cannabis and you know because I feel

4791
03:19:25,238 --> 03:19:29,478
like cannabis and hemp are the leading

4792
03:19:26,719 --> 03:19:30,920
Horsemen of this Apocalypse in a way you

4793
03:19:29,478 --> 03:19:33,358
know that are charging and kind of

4794
03:19:30,920 --> 03:19:35,079
leading this way you know you know

4795
03:19:33,359 --> 03:19:37,120
providing this great plant that's

4796
03:19:35,079 --> 03:19:39,559
helping to alleviate suffering and

4797
03:19:37,120 --> 03:19:41,600
provide empowerment and kind of and all

4798
03:19:39,559 --> 03:19:43,799
the all the tools for the you know new

4799
03:19:41,600 --> 03:19:46,238
economy and and Green Revolution that's

4800
03:19:43,799 --> 03:19:48,039
to come you know with this plant and and

4801
03:19:46,238 --> 03:19:50,119
you know and so I feel like it's helping

4802
03:19:48,040 --> 03:19:52,760
us with to gain Clarity in this time of

4803
03:19:50,120 --> 03:19:54,960
Revelation and and the way it's leading

4804
03:19:52,760 --> 03:19:57,398
the path for these other plants and

4805
03:19:54,959 --> 03:19:59,478
entheogens and ancient medicines to have

4806
03:19:57,398 --> 03:20:00,840
their way forward and through this

4807
03:19:59,478 --> 03:20:02,159
pathway you know I feel like are you

4808
03:20:00,840 --> 03:20:04,799
know they're the other horsemen of this

4809
03:20:02,159 --> 03:20:06,279
apocalypse this giant full circle I mean

4810
03:20:04,799 --> 03:20:08,559
when Mark said it's like we're all

4811
03:20:06,279 --> 03:20:10,479
instead of you know instead basically

4812
03:20:08,559 --> 03:20:11,959
the story of the immortality key and and

4813
03:20:10,478 --> 03:20:15,000
that shell is that there was this

4814
03:20:11,959 --> 03:20:17,519
unknown unnamed religion that had to

4815
03:20:15,000 --> 03:20:19,079
have had something major going on in it

4816
03:20:17,520 --> 03:20:22,000
because it wasn't about faith it was

4817
03:20:19,079 --> 03:20:25,120
more like this ancient Greek methodology

4818
03:20:22,000 --> 03:20:28,040
of thinking and Sciences and physics and

4819
03:20:25,120 --> 03:20:29,680
yeah the yeah the yeah exactly and that

4820
03:20:28,040 --> 03:20:32,120
Elixir that they were drinking and then

4821
03:20:29,680 --> 03:20:33,880
him having to go to Barcelona to find

4822
03:20:32,120 --> 03:20:36,720
proof that there was

4823
03:20:33,879 --> 03:20:39,198
erotized uh grain that was made into

4824
03:20:36,719 --> 03:20:41,000
this Elixir and just really incredible

4825
03:20:39,199 --> 03:20:42,479
story and then you got your Palo

4826
03:20:41,000 --> 03:20:44,959
Christians and they come along and they

4827
03:20:42,478 --> 03:20:47,119
kind of remove all these sacraments

4828
03:20:44,959 --> 03:20:49,358
replace it with the blood of of Christ

4829
03:20:47,120 --> 03:20:50,680
and the bread ritual which is very just

4830
03:20:49,359 --> 03:20:52,520
all of a sudden there's no Rapture

4831
03:20:50,680 --> 03:20:54,318
there's no experience it's all faith and

4832
03:20:52,520 --> 03:20:57,000
you're just sitting there talking to the

4833
03:20:54,318 --> 03:20:58,719
priest who controls it all and you can

4834
03:20:57,000 --> 03:21:02,639
kind of see how we're coming out of that

4835
03:20:58,719 --> 03:21:04,039
after so many Millennium really you know

4836
03:21:02,639 --> 03:21:06,039
like coming out of that experience

4837
03:21:04,040 --> 03:21:08,120
getting back and cannabis is of course

4838
03:21:06,040 --> 03:21:10,479
you know the leading uh Horseman like

4839
03:21:08,120 --> 03:21:12,720
you mentioned and and psych cannabis you

4840
03:21:10,478 --> 03:21:15,599
have okay we can take care of you know

4841
03:21:12,719 --> 03:21:17,799
it's very much reminiscent to me of the

4842
03:21:15,600 --> 03:21:20,720
bag ofa's and the way they look at yoga

4843
03:21:17,799 --> 03:21:22,920
for the body and meditation for the mind

4844
03:21:20,719 --> 03:21:24,879
you've got cannabis really I I'm sure

4845
03:21:22,920 --> 03:21:26,680
you can say it's for the mind and body

4846
03:21:24,879 --> 03:21:29,639
but then you have the psychedelics that

4847
03:21:26,680 --> 03:21:32,559
are for now you know outside that five

4848
03:21:29,639 --> 03:21:35,879
cense prison you know Spirit exactly

4849
03:21:32,559 --> 03:21:38,159
like completely removed from goad Alec a

4850
03:21:35,879 --> 03:21:41,719
question I have so as psychedelics

4851
03:21:38,159 --> 03:21:44,680
become less regulated and more prevent

4852
03:21:41,719 --> 03:21:48,318
in kind of recreational ways are are

4853
03:21:44,680 --> 03:21:52,279
Labs like SC are you guys doing testing

4854
03:21:48,318 --> 03:21:54,159
of psychedelics or are are is is there

4855
03:21:52,279 --> 03:21:56,040
testing of psychedelics or what what

4856
03:21:54,159 --> 03:21:58,520
would that look like I mean is that

4857
03:21:56,040 --> 03:22:02,680
again an industry that has to kind of

4858
03:21:58,520 --> 03:22:04,800
parallel the developing of psychedelic

4859
03:22:02,680 --> 03:22:06,600
products or mushrooms or whatever you

4860
03:22:04,799 --> 03:22:09,840
know people are going to be ingesting or

4861
03:22:06,600 --> 03:22:11,720
eating totally yes so um so so real

4862
03:22:09,840 --> 03:22:13,040
quick before that um just to to wrap

4863
03:22:11,719 --> 03:22:14,920
that other thought too you know because

4864
03:22:13,040 --> 03:22:16,040
on the like immortality key and

4865
03:22:14,920 --> 03:22:17,840
everything you know I'm really

4866
03:22:16,040 --> 03:22:20,040
fascinated by this new kind of field of

4867
03:22:17,840 --> 03:22:22,199
archo chemistry you know where they're

4868
03:22:20,040 --> 03:22:24,920
kind of scraping the insides of these

4869
03:22:22,199 --> 03:22:28,120
ancient found kind of you know artifacts

4870
03:22:24,920 --> 03:22:31,398
you know of like chalice and um and also

4871
03:22:28,120 --> 03:22:34,000
of H like you know the the kipe which is

4872
03:22:31,398 --> 03:22:36,478
a tool that you administer you know this

4873
03:22:34,000 --> 03:22:39,478
these South American Brazilian Amazon

4874
03:22:36,478 --> 03:22:41,039
kind of powders you know uh through your

4875
03:22:39,478 --> 03:22:42,238
through your nasal cavity right um you

4876
03:22:41,040 --> 03:22:44,359
know there you know they found one in

4877
03:22:42,238 --> 03:22:47,238
Chile you scraped it did some aroch

4878
03:22:44,359 --> 03:22:49,318
chemistry on it and found five Meo ndmt

4879
03:22:47,238 --> 03:22:50,079
bantine which you know essentially you

4880
03:22:49,318 --> 03:22:53,198
know

4881
03:22:50,079 --> 03:22:54,879
and the the tool carbonated like 7,000

4882
03:22:53,199 --> 03:22:57,120
years ago and so essentially it's

4883
03:22:54,879 --> 03:23:00,639
predating kind of the use of this tool

4884
03:22:57,120 --> 03:23:02,520
to administer YOLO or Vila which are two

4885
03:23:00,639 --> 03:23:04,879
kind of uh you know really powerful

4886
03:23:02,520 --> 03:23:06,279
Spirit medicines you know through your

4887
03:23:04,879 --> 03:23:07,599
through your nasal cavity to your nose

4888
03:23:06,279 --> 03:23:09,479
you know and so and and it's just

4889
03:23:07,600 --> 03:23:10,960
fascinating how deep it's going you know

4890
03:23:09,478 --> 03:23:13,039
kind of and all the compounds they're

4891
03:23:10,959 --> 03:23:15,079
finding but but to your to your point in

4892
03:23:13,040 --> 03:23:16,880
question on on testing you know I'm

4893
03:23:15,079 --> 03:23:19,000
really excited about you know CU with

4894
03:23:16,879 --> 03:23:21,639
right now you know it's it's you know I

4895
03:23:19,000 --> 03:23:24,120
mean prop 215 set you know in California

4896
03:23:21,639 --> 03:23:27,198
set for where Labs could you know had

4897
03:23:24,120 --> 03:23:29,960
legal abil or had had had at least state

4898
03:23:27,199 --> 03:23:32,040
Proposition of coverage to be able to

4899
03:23:29,959 --> 03:23:34,398
take you know these federally illegal

4900
03:23:32,040 --> 03:23:36,080
schedule one substances you know and you

4901
03:23:34,398 --> 03:23:37,639
know order analytical reference

4902
03:23:36,079 --> 03:23:39,359
standards and begin testing so there was

4903
03:23:37,639 --> 03:23:41,039
a little bit of coverage like right now

4904
03:23:39,359 --> 03:23:42,680
there's no coverage right so you know

4905
03:23:41,040 --> 03:23:44,160
all the compounds you know that we're

4906
03:23:42,680 --> 03:23:45,760
talking about that are coming to be

4907
03:23:44,159 --> 03:23:47,559
liberalized or legalized are all

4908
03:23:45,760 --> 03:23:51,159
currently still ferally one Controlled

4909
03:23:47,559 --> 03:23:53,039
Substances you know complicates matters

4910
03:23:51,159 --> 03:23:56,439
right you can't you have to have

4911
03:23:53,040 --> 03:24:00,000
standards for it like I said

4912
03:23:56,439 --> 03:24:02,960
and it's like all those compounds unlike

4913
03:24:00,000 --> 03:24:07,000
the canabo I believe all these compounds

4914
03:24:02,959 --> 03:24:10,000
are water soluble um there uh you don't

4915
03:24:07,000 --> 03:24:12,520
necessarily have to have oil oil

4916
03:24:10,000 --> 03:24:14,238
solubility but the nice thing is that if

4917
03:24:12,520 --> 03:24:16,680
they're def phenethylamines they have a

4918
03:24:14,238 --> 03:24:21,959
nice chromophor so they're good

4919
03:24:16,680 --> 03:24:23,920
candidates for hlc detection and again I

4920
03:24:21,959 --> 03:24:25,358
have like no clue like maybe you guys

4921
03:24:23,920 --> 03:24:28,279
know or maybe just throw up for

4922
03:24:25,359 --> 03:24:30,040
discussion like when we look at cannabis

4923
03:24:28,279 --> 03:24:31,640
like this beautiful picture of the hash

4924
03:24:30,040 --> 03:24:36,439
Church variety we're looking at we see

4925
03:24:31,639 --> 03:24:39,559
something that's got like 20% canono on

4926
03:24:36,439 --> 03:24:43,238
that on that flower material what what's

4927
03:24:39,559 --> 03:24:45,039
the percentage of uh of psilocybin on

4928
03:24:43,238 --> 03:24:48,318
mushrooms does anyone know I mean is it

4929
03:24:45,040 --> 03:24:48,319
like 5% 10%

4930
03:24:48,680 --> 03:24:52,159
well well so and so and so and that that

4931
03:24:50,959 --> 03:24:53,438
kind of leads to finish that thought

4932
03:24:52,159 --> 03:24:55,119
though because because I think that's I

4933
03:24:53,439 --> 03:24:56,559
mean there's a lot to that you know to

4934
03:24:55,120 --> 03:24:58,199
be discovered just like kind of was

4935
03:24:56,559 --> 03:24:59,959
happen avonoids in testing cannabis

4936
03:24:58,199 --> 03:25:02,840
whenever that kind of came to be but in

4937
03:24:59,959 --> 03:25:05,519
Oregon measure 109 passed which is which

4938
03:25:02,840 --> 03:25:07,478
legalizes cybin and now um now the the

4939
03:25:05,520 --> 03:25:10,479
state has the next year and a half or

4940
03:25:07,478 --> 03:25:14,119
two to develop uh licensing and

4941
03:25:10,478 --> 03:25:15,760
regulation for for for licensed and

4942
03:25:14,120 --> 03:25:19,319
legalized cybin and so there's going to

4943
03:25:15,760 --> 03:25:22,359
be three LIC includ analytical testing

4944
03:25:19,318 --> 03:25:24,159
standards yeah there there's three

4945
03:25:22,359 --> 03:25:28,238
production this is how you make it and

4946
03:25:24,159 --> 03:25:29,439
this is how you that produ well yeah

4947
03:25:28,238 --> 03:25:30,760
yeah totally totally well there so

4948
03:25:29,439 --> 03:25:32,639
there's there's a there's a cultivation

4949
03:25:30,760 --> 03:25:34,680
license there's a therapy center

4950
03:25:32,639 --> 03:25:37,079
therapist license and then there's an

4951
03:25:34,680 --> 03:25:39,279
analytical Testing Lab license and so

4952
03:25:37,079 --> 03:25:40,879
and the and this and this and the the

4953
03:25:39,279 --> 03:25:42,800
organ Health authorities going to be the

4954
03:25:40,879 --> 03:25:45,398
ones regulating and Licensing the

4955
03:25:42,799 --> 03:25:47,159
testing labs and we're already regulated

4956
03:25:45,398 --> 03:25:49,039
by the organ health to the highest of

4957
03:25:47,159 --> 03:25:50,840
degree for cannabis and up in you know

4958
03:25:49,040 --> 03:25:53,040
for we have a lap up in Tiger just south

4959
03:25:50,840 --> 03:25:54,520
of Portland and so we're really excited

4960
03:25:53,040 --> 03:25:56,239
because we're we're hoping that that

4961
03:25:54,520 --> 03:25:57,880
kind of gives us just a bit of a shoe in

4962
03:25:56,238 --> 03:26:00,079
to be able to do start doing that

4963
03:25:57,879 --> 03:26:01,719
testing because we have a group that

4964
03:26:00,079 --> 03:26:05,398
we're we're going to be working with

4965
03:26:01,719 --> 03:26:07,760
that has over 120 unique psilocybin

4966
03:26:05,398 --> 03:26:10,599
geographical discerned varidol that

4967
03:26:07,760 --> 03:26:13,159
they're looking to have us begin to like

4968
03:26:10,600 --> 03:26:15,279
develop testing to identify the MCO

4969
03:26:13,159 --> 03:26:16,879
characterize or whatever to Cho you know

4970
03:26:15,279 --> 03:26:19,000
the chemotype of all these different

4971
03:26:16,879 --> 03:26:21,318
mushrooms so I'm really excited to see

4972
03:26:19,000 --> 03:26:23,559
how that comes about but until then you

4973
03:26:21,318 --> 03:26:25,478
know kind of then you have to have da

4974
03:26:23,559 --> 03:26:27,318
schedule one license would't it be

4975
03:26:25,478 --> 03:26:29,879
interesting when you walk in you walk

4976
03:26:27,318 --> 03:26:31,760
into the dispensary or the the mushroom

4977
03:26:29,879 --> 03:26:35,000
dispensary or whatever the hell it is

4978
03:26:31,760 --> 03:26:37,520
someday and people are buying based on

4979
03:26:35,000 --> 03:26:41,439
hey that's got 20% this has got 15

4980
03:26:37,520 --> 03:26:44,319
that's got 20 oh you know and the kovar

4981
03:26:41,439 --> 03:26:47,520
the kovar oh this one's got Bist and nor

4982
03:26:44,318 --> 03:26:48,639
Bist I'm grabbing these yes exactly I

4983
03:26:47,520 --> 03:26:50,159
was just about you just finished my

4984
03:26:48,639 --> 03:26:54,920
sentence I was just going to bring up

4985
03:26:50,159 --> 03:26:56,318
nor nor noris or noros yeah yeah but

4986
03:26:54,920 --> 03:26:59,639
there's and then there's certain varials

4987
03:26:56,318 --> 03:27:01,119
and have kind of their own maois in them

4988
03:26:59,639 --> 03:27:03,039
and so it'll be really interesting to

4989
03:27:01,120 --> 03:27:05,800
see where that goes but ultimately one

4990
03:27:03,040 --> 03:27:09,600
of my biggest passions in life is around

4991
03:27:05,799 --> 03:27:12,079
ethnobot and and the Ooty and um and to

4992
03:27:09,600 --> 03:27:13,680
be able to build off of what we've

4993
03:27:12,079 --> 03:27:15,680
learned and been able you know because

4994
03:27:13,680 --> 03:27:17,398
cannabis you know for what it's worth

4995
03:27:15,680 --> 03:27:19,279
represents probably one of the most

4996
03:27:17,398 --> 03:27:21,198
difficult matrices that analytical

4997
03:27:19,279 --> 03:27:23,560
chemistry has ever had to approach or

4998
03:27:21,199 --> 03:27:25,520
test you know and so to be able to have

4999
03:27:23,559 --> 03:27:28,119
learned um you know and so it's an

5000
03:27:25,520 --> 03:27:29,560
incredibly difficult process to learn

5001
03:27:28,120 --> 03:27:32,279
and to actually get right because of how

5002
03:27:29,559 --> 03:27:34,600
much you know 30% resin content up to

5003
03:27:32,279 --> 03:27:37,359
that you know gunks up all part of the

5004
03:27:34,600 --> 03:27:39,520
hlc's gc's mass effects and so to be

5005
03:27:37,359 --> 03:27:41,680
able to develop methods to resolve that

5006
03:27:39,520 --> 03:27:43,880
Matrix so that you can do the testing

5007
03:27:41,680 --> 03:27:45,760
accurately and repeatedly is is such an

5008
03:27:43,879 --> 03:27:47,318
Endeavor and you know I think those labs

5009
03:27:45,760 --> 03:27:49,559
that have

5010
03:27:47,318 --> 03:27:51,119
that that do the work and learn how to

5011
03:27:49,559 --> 03:27:52,278
how to operate on such level are going

5012
03:27:51,120 --> 03:27:54,000
to be some of the highest performing

5013
03:27:52,279 --> 03:27:56,159
analytical labs in the world you know

5014
03:27:54,000 --> 03:27:57,959
because I mean it's we're not you know

5015
03:27:56,159 --> 03:27:59,520
testing dirt testing water Sol you know

5016
03:27:57,959 --> 03:28:01,759
a lot of water Sol they're relatively

5017
03:27:59,520 --> 03:28:03,279
straightforward but you know cannabis is

5018
03:28:01,760 --> 03:28:05,639
just presented this very difficult to

5019
03:28:03,279 --> 03:28:07,800
challenge to analytical chemistry but

5020
03:28:05,639 --> 03:28:10,000
but from there you know being able to

5021
03:28:07,799 --> 03:28:11,478
learn and ultimately test all these

5022
03:28:10,000 --> 03:28:13,959
other coming you know incredibly

5023
03:28:11,478 --> 03:28:15,840
important plant compounds you know is

5024
03:28:13,959 --> 03:28:17,278
one of my excitements and passions for

5025
03:28:15,840 --> 03:28:19,880
you know where where I'm going

5026
03:28:17,279 --> 03:28:22,359
personally so Alec then when I when I

5027
03:28:19,879 --> 03:28:25,759
start the traversing the fungal

5028
03:28:22,359 --> 03:28:27,880
terpenome live show on my channel here

5029
03:28:25,760 --> 03:28:32,318
which is going to be a similar one to

5030
03:28:27,879 --> 03:28:34,759
hasur you're in right yeah yeah all in

5031
03:28:32,318 --> 03:28:37,000
all in thank you so much that that's

5032
03:28:34,760 --> 03:28:38,960
such a beautiful beautiful that's such a

5033
03:28:37,000 --> 03:28:40,559
beautiful name of the paper too and I I

5034
03:28:38,959 --> 03:28:44,000
appreciate that turning me

5035
03:28:40,559 --> 03:28:46,519
on for sure yeah absolutely Dr isn't

5036
03:28:44,000 --> 03:28:49,238
that just funny that you know again not

5037
03:28:46,520 --> 03:28:51,120
to go back to the Grateful Dead but so

5038
03:28:49,238 --> 03:28:54,039
as a Young dead head you would have your

5039
03:28:51,120 --> 03:28:57,160
shrooms and you have your bag of weed

5040
03:28:54,040 --> 03:29:00,640
right so in a way they kind of

5041
03:28:57,159 --> 03:29:02,359
knew ABS knew right they totally knew

5042
03:29:00,639 --> 03:29:06,519
what are you talking about forget about

5043
03:29:02,359 --> 03:29:08,479
kind of was like 100% are you kidding me

5044
03:29:06,520 --> 03:29:09,920
so you know one thing takes you one way

5045
03:29:08,478 --> 03:29:12,119
and another thing takes you completely

5046
03:29:09,920 --> 03:29:14,398
in a different direction I will mention

5047
03:29:12,120 --> 03:29:16,359
again because I I love saying traversing

5048
03:29:14,398 --> 03:29:18,879
the fungal terpenome it's just just

5049
03:29:16,359 --> 03:29:22,079
awesome but I did start a Facebook group

5050
03:29:18,879 --> 03:29:24,318
called traversing the fungal turpino and

5051
03:29:22,079 --> 03:29:26,279
we've been sharing all sorts of edible

5052
03:29:24,318 --> 03:29:28,278
mushrooms and psychedelic mushrooms and

5053
03:29:26,279 --> 03:29:30,640
identification tips and tricks and

5054
03:29:28,279 --> 03:29:32,399
stories and books and it's actually

5055
03:29:30,639 --> 03:29:35,559
becoming a pretty cool little community

5056
03:29:32,398 --> 03:29:37,198
so if you are on Facebook um if you're

5057
03:29:35,559 --> 03:29:39,600
not and you hate Facebook I don't need

5058
03:29:37,199 --> 03:29:41,960
to hear about it it's all good um but if

5059
03:29:39,600 --> 03:29:43,680
you are join the group check us out

5060
03:29:41,959 --> 03:29:46,039
we're uh we're in there and it'll be the

5061
03:29:43,680 --> 03:29:47,600
same name of the show uh when I hope

5062
03:29:46,040 --> 03:29:50,199
hopefully get it together so I'll try to

5063
03:29:47,600 --> 03:29:51,960
send out an email here soon to Alec and

5064
03:29:50,199 --> 03:29:54,120
Dr Mark and a few other people I've been

5065
03:29:51,959 --> 03:29:55,398
thinking about for this particular show

5066
03:29:54,120 --> 03:29:57,359
it's going to have some different people

5067
03:29:55,398 --> 03:29:59,959
on it for sure and we'll be talking

5068
03:29:57,359 --> 03:30:02,439
about uh you know not just mushrooms but

5069
03:29:59,959 --> 03:30:05,719
uh you know a variety of the Psychedelic

5070
03:30:02,439 --> 03:30:08,079
uh plants and and fungi that we yeah

5071
03:30:05,719 --> 03:30:10,278
Colin I got your comment last week you

5072
03:30:08,079 --> 03:30:12,680
know on hash Church you were like oh I

5073
03:30:10,279 --> 03:30:16,159
wish Mark was here because he lives near

5074
03:30:12,680 --> 03:30:19,960
kenet yeah you're near kenet and uh yeah

5075
03:30:16,159 --> 03:30:23,238
also was read you know I'm a I'm a big

5076
03:30:19,959 --> 03:30:28,519
fan of of you know of psychedelics and I

5077
03:30:23,238 --> 03:30:31,398
was reading about you know um f mayo and

5078
03:30:28,520 --> 03:30:35,120
the Frog and hunting hunting frogs just

5079
03:30:31,398 --> 03:30:38,159
from you know it's it's fascinating how

5080
03:30:35,120 --> 03:30:40,720
the work that was left behind led to

5081
03:30:38,159 --> 03:30:44,279
synthesizing that

5082
03:30:40,719 --> 03:30:45,679
and um perhaps we can get a couple

5083
03:30:44,279 --> 03:30:47,520
friends of mine to come on and talk

5084
03:30:45,680 --> 03:30:51,398
about about

5085
03:30:47,520 --> 03:30:53,079
that um as well as as you know so what

5086
03:30:51,398 --> 03:30:54,840
are your thoughts what what are your

5087
03:30:53,079 --> 03:30:58,478
thoughts on on that is you think that

5088
03:30:54,840 --> 03:31:03,559
area is going to get reinvigorated

5089
03:30:58,478 --> 03:31:06,559
again well uh you mean in fungus

5090
03:31:03,559 --> 03:31:06,559
yeah

5091
03:31:07,079 --> 03:31:14,799
well F fungus is so fungi is so diverse

5092
03:31:12,760 --> 03:31:16,920
they have their own goddamn Kingdom for

5093
03:31:14,799 --> 03:31:20,119
Christ sakes right I mean they're their

5094
03:31:16,920 --> 03:31:22,238
own [ __ ] thing dude they're just like

5095
03:31:20,120 --> 03:31:24,680
yeah they figured out how to make very

5096
03:31:22,238 --> 03:31:28,920
complex molecules and everything from

5097
03:31:24,680 --> 03:31:30,720
yeast to uh what filous fungi I probably

5098
03:31:28,920 --> 03:31:34,719
just said that wrong but you know the

5099
03:31:30,719 --> 03:31:38,639
fungi that are in our guts the fungi

5100
03:31:34,719 --> 03:31:41,438
that are behind Marcus my family in uh

5101
03:31:38,639 --> 03:31:44,358
Upstate New York uh used to be Avid

5102
03:31:41,439 --> 03:31:46,680
hunters and Seekers of the so-called Hen

5103
03:31:44,359 --> 03:31:49,520
of the Woods which is sort of

5104
03:31:46,680 --> 03:31:52,359
domesticated here down in kenet square

5105
03:31:49,520 --> 03:31:56,600
Phillips calls it the Mitaki mushrooms

5106
03:31:52,359 --> 03:31:59,680
which they grow on um on towers that are

5107
03:31:56,600 --> 03:32:02,279
made I think of a PVC pipe and they have

5108
03:31:59,680 --> 03:32:05,000
some kind of meshing where the nutrient

5109
03:32:02,279 --> 03:32:08,720
around it and the flower bodies are kind

5110
03:32:05,000 --> 03:32:12,439
of growing radially from the nutrients

5111
03:32:08,719 --> 03:32:15,238
that flow through this thing and um they

5112
03:32:12,439 --> 03:32:17,199
they really only get to only so big when

5113
03:32:15,238 --> 03:32:19,559
they're uh when they're grown

5114
03:32:17,199 --> 03:32:22,840
commercially but when you find those in

5115
03:32:19,559 --> 03:32:26,318
the wild those things could be as big as

5116
03:32:22,840 --> 03:32:29,639
the trunk of a Volkswagen I mean I've

5117
03:32:26,318 --> 03:32:31,198
seen these mushrooms be so huge and

5118
03:32:29,639 --> 03:32:33,439
they're delicious they're wonderful

5119
03:32:31,199 --> 03:32:35,439
pickled they're great just in any

5120
03:32:33,439 --> 03:32:38,040
mushroom recipe you know whether you're

5121
03:32:35,439 --> 03:32:39,439
making soups or whatever you do with

5122
03:32:38,040 --> 03:32:41,960
mushrooms I mean it's a wonderfully

5123
03:32:39,439 --> 03:32:46,318
edible mushroom and of the woods I like

5124
03:32:41,959 --> 03:32:48,599
to gobble them gobble gobble

5125
03:32:46,318 --> 03:32:50,799
there's a couple restaurants of noted

5126
03:32:48,600 --> 03:32:52,199
Variety in Vermont called Hen of the

5127
03:32:50,799 --> 03:32:54,840
Woods and there are five-star

5128
03:32:52,199 --> 03:32:58,359
restaurants that are absolutely worth

5129
03:32:54,840 --> 03:33:00,478
going to so if you're ever in Vermont in

5130
03:32:58,359 --> 03:33:03,040
Waterberry go to The Hen of the Woods

5131
03:33:00,478 --> 03:33:07,039
It's a Wonderful restaurant sweet I'll

5132
03:33:03,040 --> 03:33:08,560
check that out listen I I wanna oh go

5133
03:33:07,040 --> 03:33:10,520
ahead I was gonna add one one thing

5134
03:33:08,559 --> 03:33:12,519
about psychedelics Mark and you'll love

5135
03:33:10,520 --> 03:33:15,439
this is that you know again if you go

5136
03:33:12,520 --> 03:33:17,960
like the fish tour where fish tour kind

5137
03:33:15,439 --> 03:33:22,238
of got kind of crazy is when people

5138
03:33:17,959 --> 03:33:24,119
started doing powders and like MDMA and

5139
03:33:22,238 --> 03:33:27,680
all other [ __ ] kind of came in there and

5140
03:33:24,120 --> 03:33:30,479
to me it's like the TR right all that

5141
03:33:27,680 --> 03:33:32,720
other crap kind of like was this

5142
03:33:30,478 --> 03:33:36,000
toxicity in the scene that was now we're

5143
03:33:32,719 --> 03:33:38,478
using the word toxicity to mean toxic

5144
03:33:36,000 --> 03:33:41,959
and to me it's like the only true thing

5145
03:33:38,478 --> 03:33:45,478
the only true thing was was mushrooms

5146
03:33:41,959 --> 03:33:48,478
and you know LSD if it was good LSD now

5147
03:33:45,478 --> 03:33:50,318
that's big if but you know but to me I

5148
03:33:48,478 --> 03:33:53,039
we stayed away from everything else

5149
03:33:50,318 --> 03:33:55,478
because I just saw that tear people up

5150
03:33:53,040 --> 03:33:57,160
and make idiots out of people and

5151
03:33:55,478 --> 03:33:59,679
eventually lead to people who are no

5152
03:33:57,159 --> 03:34:02,359
longer here and change the vibe of the

5153
03:33:59,680 --> 03:34:04,318
whole scene like it really did Chang the

5154
03:34:02,359 --> 03:34:07,040
vibe when I showed up accidentally you

5155
03:34:04,318 --> 03:34:10,119
were going right Mark right I mean I I

5156
03:34:07,040 --> 03:34:13,800
showed up in 93 and it felt like it was

5157
03:34:10,120 --> 03:34:16,040
still pretty legit it felt like this is

5158
03:34:13,799 --> 03:34:19,759
yeah it felt pretty OG it seemed like it

5159
03:34:16,040 --> 03:34:21,680
was around I don't know maybe 97 or yeah

5160
03:34:19,760 --> 03:34:24,719
maybe even 99 there was a little bit of

5161
03:34:21,680 --> 03:34:26,680
it in 97 on the East Coast but yeah it

5162
03:34:24,719 --> 03:34:29,478
is what it is they they made it through

5163
03:34:26,680 --> 03:34:31,800
they're still alive they're rock stars

5164
03:34:29,478 --> 03:34:34,278
they had to have some stories but it was

5165
03:34:31,799 --> 03:34:37,879
it was heavy for sure the whole powdered

5166
03:34:34,279 --> 03:34:39,680
drug thing seemed unnecessary but uh you

5167
03:34:37,879 --> 03:34:42,358
always have a

5168
03:34:39,680 --> 03:34:44,639
choice terrible humans love white

5169
03:34:42,359 --> 03:34:47,199
powders I don't know what it is well

5170
03:34:44,639 --> 03:34:49,358
humans love seems as though you know not

5171
03:34:47,199 --> 03:34:51,399
to get too heavy into it but you know if

5172
03:34:49,359 --> 03:34:54,680
we can agree on that it's likely that we

5173
03:34:51,398 --> 03:34:56,559
came from some somewhere maybe a source

5174
03:34:54,680 --> 03:34:58,479
maybe we were all one energy and we're

5175
03:34:56,559 --> 03:35:00,359
going all to this one energy and this

5176
03:34:58,478 --> 03:35:03,119
particular experience is a splintered

5177
03:35:00,359 --> 03:35:05,079
fractured ego version that you get to be

5178
03:35:03,120 --> 03:35:06,840
you and you get to do whatever you want

5179
03:35:05,079 --> 03:35:08,680
and you don't have you're not a part of

5180
03:35:06,840 --> 03:35:10,398
everything yet you kind of are but you

5181
03:35:08,680 --> 03:35:12,479
get to make mistakes and you get to make

5182
03:35:10,398 --> 03:35:15,000
bad choices and some people are here to

5183
03:35:12,478 --> 03:35:17,879
make bad choices they want to make lots

5184
03:35:15,000 --> 03:35:19,680
of bad choices and guess what that's

5185
03:35:17,879 --> 03:35:21,198
that's the freedom of life right there

5186
03:35:19,680 --> 03:35:23,800
they get to do that if that's so what

5187
03:35:21,199 --> 03:35:25,479
they choose to do other people we try to

5188
03:35:23,799 --> 03:35:27,840
make good choices and we end up making

5189
03:35:25,478 --> 03:35:29,679
some bad choices along the way so it all

5190
03:35:27,840 --> 03:35:31,359
seems to be a challenge around every

5191
03:35:29,680 --> 03:35:33,559
corner it's like should I eat the

5192
03:35:31,359 --> 03:35:34,960
mushroom or should I snort the cocaine

5193
03:35:33,559 --> 03:35:37,600
and I mean metaphorically because I'm

5194
03:35:34,959 --> 03:35:39,198
not a big cocaine snorter at all but

5195
03:35:37,600 --> 03:35:41,520
metaphorically there's always those two

5196
03:35:39,199 --> 03:35:43,000
options it's kind of like should I make

5197
03:35:41,520 --> 03:35:45,000
take this Choice over here or should I

5198
03:35:43,000 --> 03:35:47,559
take this Choice over here and they all

5199
03:35:45,000 --> 03:35:50,079
tend to lead us to one place where we

5200
03:35:47,559 --> 03:35:52,680
all get to end up which is 6 feet in the

5201
03:35:50,079 --> 03:35:56,680
ground uh unless you're getting like

5202
03:35:52,680 --> 03:35:59,920
Prince you know we gonna die what what a

5203
03:35:56,680 --> 03:36:02,880
shame again that that he had a doctor

5204
03:35:59,920 --> 03:36:05,879
who was feeding him with all that toxic

5205
03:36:02,879 --> 03:36:09,198
[ __ ] and as talented as Prince was and

5206
03:36:05,879 --> 03:36:11,719
it it's terrible to lose someone and now

5207
03:36:09,199 --> 03:36:15,680
to just have his musical Legacy around

5208
03:36:11,719 --> 03:36:18,519
but you know just um yeah we've all lost

5209
03:36:15,680 --> 03:36:21,199
loved ones to substance abuse and it's

5210
03:36:18,520 --> 03:36:22,720
it's just it's terrible and you'd think

5211
03:36:21,199 --> 03:36:24,920
man if they just would have ate some

5212
03:36:22,719 --> 03:36:28,959
mushrooms and smoke some weed they'd

5213
03:36:24,920 --> 03:36:31,639
still be here well you know and and I I

5214
03:36:28,959 --> 03:36:33,358
really appreciate both those those those

5215
03:36:31,639 --> 03:36:36,039
those two thoughts you know um I feel

5216
03:36:33,359 --> 03:36:37,800
like I've been on a mission kind of uh

5217
03:36:36,040 --> 03:36:39,359
especially you know kind of doing as

5218
03:36:37,799 --> 03:36:41,840
much work as I've been doing over the

5219
03:36:39,359 --> 03:36:44,359
last decade with with other plant

5220
03:36:41,840 --> 03:36:47,040
ceremonies medicine work kind of iasa

5221
03:36:44,359 --> 03:36:48,840
etc etc um you I feel I'm on a mission

5222
03:36:47,040 --> 03:36:52,160
to help uh my friends learn how to do

5223
03:36:48,840 --> 03:36:53,799
better drugs you know and and and and

5224
03:36:52,159 --> 03:36:55,079
and to be you know I feel like we have

5225
03:36:53,799 --> 03:36:57,639
an obligation in this life to be

5226
03:36:55,079 --> 03:36:59,359
spiritual forklifts for each other and

5227
03:36:57,639 --> 03:37:02,719
and I feel like there's a lot of really

5228
03:36:59,359 --> 03:37:04,520
like basic like low vibration you know

5229
03:37:02,719 --> 03:37:06,198
Vibes that are just overly consumed and

5230
03:37:04,520 --> 03:37:08,079
leveraged you know by some of you know

5231
03:37:06,199 --> 03:37:10,640
our closest friends and family you know

5232
03:37:08,079 --> 03:37:12,478
and so to be able to help you know in

5233
03:37:10,639 --> 03:37:14,079

5235
03:37:14,079 --> 03:37:18,478
benefited us I feel like we can

5236
03:37:16,159 --> 03:37:20,039
hopefully help kind of you know that

5237
03:37:18,478 --> 03:37:21,959
hundredth monkey effect of you know

5238
03:37:20,040 --> 03:37:23,960
getting off the bed and onto the real

5239
03:37:21,959 --> 03:37:27,839
medicines that are actually quite

5240
03:37:23,959 --> 03:37:29,438
fascinating my my my wife and I we with

5241
03:37:27,840 --> 03:37:31,680
a couple other couples and we had

5242
03:37:29,439 --> 03:37:34,840
dropped some acid and we were sitting at

5243
03:37:31,680 --> 03:37:37,040
this one outdoor uh restaurant we were

5244
03:37:34,840 --> 03:37:38,880
just laughing up a storm we were just

5245
03:37:37,040 --> 03:37:40,920
having such a great time we were having

5246
03:37:38,879 --> 03:37:44,079
such a great time that the table next to

5247
03:37:40,920 --> 03:37:47,799
us said we want whatever they're

5248
03:37:44,079 --> 03:37:51,279
drinking so I mean yeah I mean I I think

5249
03:37:47,799 --> 03:37:53,920
it kind of like it radiates people know

5250
03:37:51,279 --> 03:37:56,520
they're like those people are extra

5251
03:37:53,920 --> 03:37:58,680
happy that's when you bring them a tiny

5252
03:37:56,520 --> 03:38:00,479
you bring them a tiny tiny little shot

5253
03:37:58,680 --> 03:38:01,800
glass and you're like here you go

5254
03:38:00,478 --> 03:38:04,559
they're like what the hell is this it's

5255
03:38:01,799 --> 03:38:06,799
like it's about 250 milligrams uh here

5256
03:38:04,559 --> 03:38:06,799
you

5257
03:38:06,879 --> 03:38:11,000
go

5258
03:38:08,719 --> 03:38:13,079
yes well listen it was a great

5259
03:38:11,000 --> 03:38:15,959
conversation today I completely enjoyed

5260
03:38:13,079 --> 03:38:18,439
it I did want to finish up one thing

5261
03:38:15,959 --> 03:38:21,679
which Alex just meant in regards to we

5262
03:38:18,439 --> 03:38:24,120
need to be spiritual

5263
03:38:21,680 --> 03:38:26,880
forklifts um for each other and I think

5264
03:38:24,120 --> 03:38:28,600
that is a very good um term I really

5265
03:38:26,879 --> 03:38:30,839
like it and what I wanted to mention

5266
03:38:28,600 --> 03:38:32,439
about that was you know I've been

5267
03:38:30,840 --> 03:38:34,359
following this guy on YouTube for a

5268
03:38:32,439 --> 03:38:36,159
while even wait for quite a while now

5269
03:38:34,359 --> 03:38:37,920
he's a rapper freestyle guy I've

5270
03:38:36,159 --> 03:38:40,199
mentioned him a few him a few times

5271
03:38:37,920 --> 03:38:41,879
Harry Mack is his name he used to rap on

5272
03:38:40,199 --> 03:38:44,960
Venice Beach and he was at one of the

5273
03:38:41,879 --> 03:38:47,599
High Time Cannabis cups and uh he's got

5274
03:38:44,959 --> 03:38:49,839
a video out right now on his channel

5275
03:38:47,600 --> 03:38:52,559
it's called making an emotional

5276
03:38:49,840 --> 03:38:54,840
connection through freestyle it's from

5277
03:38:52,559 --> 03:38:56,680
two days ago I'll share it in the chat I

5278
03:38:54,840 --> 03:39:00,159
would definitely implore everyone to go

5279
03:38:56,680 --> 03:39:03,079
see that because man what he does in

5280
03:39:00,159 --> 03:39:05,199
that video is he is he becomes a

5281
03:39:03,079 --> 03:39:07,959
spiritual forklift for the guy right at

5282
03:39:05,199 --> 03:39:10,319
the end so this this heavy set guy comes

5283
03:39:07,959 --> 03:39:12,599
in at the end he's kind of he seems

5284
03:39:10,318 --> 03:39:14,439
pretty drunk and he's kind of happy but

5285
03:39:12,600 --> 03:39:16,120
he's really sad at the same time and the

5286
03:39:14,439 --> 03:39:17,960
way Harry connects with them and

5287
03:39:16,120 --> 03:39:19,239
freestyles about what this guy's going

5288
03:39:17,959 --> 03:39:21,879
through from having a two-minute

5289
03:39:19,238 --> 03:39:23,559
conversation with him is absolutely

5290
03:39:21,879 --> 03:39:24,839
phenomenal it'll definitely bring a tear

5291
03:39:23,559 --> 03:39:27,879
to your eye and I thought what a great

5292
03:39:24,840 --> 03:39:29,760
way to end the Sunday show uh with that

5293
03:39:27,879 --> 03:39:31,759
if I thought it wouldn't breach um a

5294
03:39:29,760 --> 03:39:33,040
copyright law I would sh I would share

5295
03:39:31,760 --> 03:39:34,760
it right here and now but I wouldn't

5296
03:39:33,040 --> 03:39:36,439
want to take the chance to lose this
