bit of Canadian politics in regards to

23
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:14,560
should start it off with a

24
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:18,159
rift what do you think

25
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,400
I'm I'm not saying definit you're not

26
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,040
saying no you want me to squeeze your

27
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:25,280
one out there nice little piece of rosin

28
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:27,240
that I pressed out for uh to check out

29
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,478
that's not that's that's not a little

piece I can show you let me show you

31
00:01:29,478 --> 00:01:35,840
this nice little piece of r that I

32
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:35,839
pressed up it's about about

33
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:40,560
KS you know what it's so nice to have in

34
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:43,519
the background because I can

35
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,879
just hear him saying legalize what's

36
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:47,560
just recently

37
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:50,158
happen yeah I think both Bob and Peter

38
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:54,000
of course it was Peter Tosh's 70th 70th

39
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,960
or 71st Earth strong the other day I I I

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,280
think he was 70 or 71 or he would have

41
00:01:55,959 --> 00:02:01,118
been had he uh still been around today

puffing

52
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:28,318
bowls right now of course there is the

53
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:30,159
background is the Blue Jays game which

54
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:32,560
is like the first time in 30 years or

55
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:34,280
some ridiculous thing that they made it

56
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,318
to close to the World Series I guess

57
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:38,080
they have this one more game what's up

58
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:39,359
yeah World Series it's a big deal for

59
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,080
people that care about this sort of

60
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:45,040
thing Johnny B and

61
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:47,280
I in the alternative group I knew the f

62
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:48,759
i KN I knew they were got in and I know

63
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,800
he's talking about legalizing cannibis

64
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:52,399
and I know what's happening in the

65
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,800
cannibis but in in in the realm of

66
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,120
what's happening in baseball not as much

67
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,239
unless he was puffing I would know hear

68
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,400
you you know so well here here's to a

69
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:04,519
nice uh Puff Wednesday rip with you

70
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,879
Wednesday and of course I decided to

71
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:08,080
bring my beautiful ball rig but you know

72
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:10,439
what we're going to probably use this

73
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,719
somewhere else because uh of course we

74
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:14,000
got a dual denail set up here and uh

75
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:15,560
Mark was telling me more about how he

76
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,479
has a second one set up because he's

77
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:19,560
getting I I know it's kind of

78
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:21,119
interesting when you explaining it to me

79
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,400
and I'm asking him a question while he

80
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,879
does his Great Big B to that is what

81
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,920
friends do just so they know that when

82
00:03:25,878 --> 00:03:30,438
they're finished they got to start

83
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:31,798
talking it's awesome yeah basically uh

84
00:03:30,438 --> 00:03:34,438
I unplug it at

85
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:37,640
620 throw it into the base

86
00:03:34,438 --> 00:03:41,079
unit this one's turned up to just over

87
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:43,158
1,000° oh cool okay I like that it'll

88
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,400
heat up the bowlt really the only thing

89
00:03:43,158 --> 00:03:47,479
we're missing right now is a Q-tip I

90
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,719
have been using Q-tips and I don't have

91
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:52,479
one on me if you have one that'd be

92
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:54,799
great beautiful so it's always just with

93
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:58,679
the Q-tip Tech of course you see how how

94
00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:00,239
clean that that washes out check it out

95
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,319
I know and then it's just matter of

96
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,920
really giving it that last little pump

97
00:04:02,318 --> 00:04:05,839
of air it'll probably be less than 5

98
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:07,479
minutes and we'll be able to uh a lot of

99
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,079
people when I was using the Q-tip they

100
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:12,518
freak up like what are you doing I'm

101
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:14,319
like clean out the residual clean out

102
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:16,199
the residual youan about carbon and it's

103
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:18,879
not lighting on fire it's interesting

104
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:20,400
how this isn't it does the job you know

105
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:23,478
I mean the the nail itself has only

106
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:26,000
really turned up to about 600° so I've

107
00:04:23,478 --> 00:04:28,519
even kind of cleaned it up out of a bowl

108
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,720
that was uh close to 800° and still

109
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:34,279
haven't had that do the same thing so

110
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:36,080
Q-tips guys yeah the Q-tip definitely

111
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:38,159
works I hate to call it a tech cuz

112
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:40,120
really all it is is taking a Q-tip and

113
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,000
cleaning a bowl with it it's hard to

114
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:45,720
give everything a name with tech

115
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,519
now but uh it does the good job and uh

116
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:51,440
especially this is a tech yeah this is a

117
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:52,639
tech that's huffing certain ways in

118
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:54,199
certain what do you think of that new

119
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,400
paper instead of partment haven't seen

120
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:58,038
this before well you know the thing I

121
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:00,599
like about this is that it has no

122
00:04:58,038 --> 00:05:02,319
special coating uh unlike parchment

123
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,879
which is silicone coated and the

124
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:07,599
parchment coating comes off uh in the

125
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:09,680
heat pressing of the of the rosin as

126
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,280
well as the constant opening and closing

127
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,879
it on the on the on the oil what you get

128
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:16,038
is you get that coating starting to

129
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:18,759
release and people can see it in how

130
00:05:16,038 --> 00:05:20,439
they start noticing that the rosin isn't

131
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:22,680
coming off nice anymore it's starting to

132
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:24,120
stick to the part you almost seek into

133
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,439
it that generally means that your

134
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,280
coating is gone and I don't really

135
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:29,918
understand exactly what's happening but

136
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:33,000
I know enough that if the coating is

137
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:34,839
coming off in the hash or I don't want

138
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,000
to be smoking no pretty much if it's

139
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:41,679
coming off is it going exactly that's

140
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,879
the way I feel about it for sure so um I

141
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,240
don't know let's have another couple of

142
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:47,038

it was just it happened so naturally and

206
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:05,199
then it just sort of petered out as we

207
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,960
gained more interest in our own channels

208
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,879
and producing uh different shows and

209
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:12,318

215
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:24,799
because of this crazy country that's

216
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:26,279
awesome and so we have three different

217
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,158
perspectives here and I'll say three

218
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:29,758
different perspectives I'm a unique in

219
00:08:28,158 --> 00:08:32,599
the sense that I have all three

220
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:35,158
perspectives uh but say I come from the

221
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:38,360
perspective of the idea of Consulting

222
00:08:35,158 --> 00:08:41,479
for a licensed producer these guys are

223
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:44,360
uh producing hash on a dispensary level

224
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:46,040
Johnny B is a patient let's have a

225
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,320
discussion about Justin Trudeau and the

226
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:49,278
federal government and how that's going

227
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:52,680
to affect all three of those platforms

228
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:55,080
in the canas industry yeah I mean 100%

229
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:58,519
you know what I'm saying patient uh uh

230
00:08:55,080 --> 00:09:01,519
local Grassroots dispensary industry and

231
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:04,039
of course large large scale uh license

232
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:06,120
production facilities for uh Canadian

233
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:07,759
citizens these are the three things that

234
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,639
of course I think I speak for all of us

235
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:13,559
when I say uh I welcome them all

236
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:15,600
definitely I'm going to say as a patient

237
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:18,319
that's exactly what I want to see I want

238
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:21,440
to see access I want to see access from

239
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,079
someone that I trust it's a local I like

240
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,440
I like to shop within 100 miles of my

241
00:09:23,078 --> 00:09:27,799
house I support local economy so I want

242
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,920
to support my Farmer or my friends I

243
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:33,359
also want access to like that and I need

244
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:35,399
it can I go to a pharmacy and have

245
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,079
access granted in that way or some way

246
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:41,000
or a form where if I have the same

247
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:43,799
standardized over and over or do I

248
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,919
choose like I choose I grow my own I

249
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:48,838
make my own Med gr medicine it's won't

250
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:51,240
gain Med but you yourself know how much

251
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:53,760
time and energy that takes mean I'm I'm

252
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:56,600
I'm not working I mean all the other

253
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:58,439
patients out there in the country so you

254
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,759
you need to be able to have your own

255
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:02,959
license a patient perspective there's

256
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:05,559
John's perspective right there he

257
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:09,199
absolutely requires to be able to grow

258
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:11,958
his own but on the side note he loves

259
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,759
the idea of having it available both

260
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:17,119
through dispensaries as well as through

261
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:20,039
the LIC producers or no license or NOC

262
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,839
if every way growing you know time or

263
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:23,278
basil in your backyard you want to grow

264
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,480
it by all means I'm sure there's going

265
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:27,439
to be some kind of PL count or some kind

266
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,800
of Maximum that you're allowed to do but

267
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,880
it's kind of like everything what we

268
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:31,919
have now

269
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:33,639
people tomatoes in the backyard people

270
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:35,759
go tomatoes in the backyard and then we

271
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:38,240

272
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:40,240

273
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,879

going going to have all different types

275
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:47,679
of platform but the best thing about it

276
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:50,440
is hey he said he's going to legalize

277

and he's going to do that for the

279
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,078
recreational the

280
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:59,559
medicinal for for preventative

281
00:10:56,078 --> 00:11:01,278

287
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:13,479
passion it's an exciting time right

288
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:17,000
because there's so many people that I

289
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:19,320
mean I don't we sit what we do I mean

290

passion and the love of a plan and I

292
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:24,838
mean that's what I see I see a lot of

293
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:26,479
good people in the room in the places

294
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:28,160
where they have but then there's a lot

295
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,839
of people that aren't in that for that

296
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:31,719
reason very true so I mean we're going

297
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,519
to see every end of it now that's for

298
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,959
sure but we say the shark used to be

299
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,519
circling they're there're they're in

money involved and well this is the

302
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:43,278
thing it's big money and that's my one

303
00:11:41,078 --> 00:11:46,239
worry when when Adam says or maybe no

304
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:48,720
license in a perfect world yeah there

305
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,120
would be no licensing but you can tell

306
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,639
that the the profits that will be

307
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,200

and buy your extracted resin um but

326
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:44,479
that's the best part about it we as in

327
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,440
like myself as Mar where we get able to

328
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,639
go and no one can ever

329
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:51,079
access they can't access what we're

330
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:54,560
sitting here just doesn't exist in any

331
00:12:51,078 --> 00:12:56,799
of the clubs like and I me and then in

332
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:58,759
the street there is just no absess of

333
00:12:56,799 --> 00:13:00,958
this type of medication understand so

334
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:02,919
much you need the access so the access

335
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:04,599
is more BR and with the big LP is not

336
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:06,919
larger production maybe because people

337
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,879
are so with with the with you know the

338
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:11,000
yields we get from our extractions I use

339
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:13,039
full plant matter you crazy I put in

340
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,958
Fire get up fire I don't use Shake I

341
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:19,159
don't use I use everything you use your

342
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:20,799
medicine exactly as in as in for

343
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:22,240
commercial L they're going to use the

344
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:23,719
buds here they're going to use that

345
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,879
there so I mean where there going to be

346
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,959
a point where actually need get true

347
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:30,240
medicine and use the whole time it will

348
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:32,039
be everything because

349
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,480
see how it goes I like the idea

350
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:37,599
personally of being able to see the

351
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:39,959
positive effects of a cannabis industry

352
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,920
in like what Bruce Lipton said in the

353
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:45,078
CBC this morning I read a quote from him

354
00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:47,479
uh saying that uh when we see the

355
00:13:45,078 --> 00:13:49,278
airports that this tax builds and when

356
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:51,440
we see the bridges and the

357
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:53,679
infrastructure that will be the most

358
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:57,079
powerful thing that uh cannabis

359
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:58,198
legalization in Canada uh will show in

360
00:13:57,078 --> 00:14:00,519
my opinion and just stop making

361
00:13:58,198 --> 00:14:02,000
criminals at this yeah that's it that's

362
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:03,879
it that's it I don't feel like a

363
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,839
criminal you know I don't I never really

364
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:09,000
felt like a criminal I mean I because

365
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:09,000
you

366
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:13,319
said we're going to catch up with you

367
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:15,838
guys in a

368
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:18,320
bit all right so just bumped into Chris

369
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,720
Bennett here guys and uh I wanted to

370
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,440
just stop real quick on this puff

371
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,959
Wednesday we we got to have a puff up

372
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:26,079
there but we didn't film it um oh that's

373
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:28,399
cool hey yeah I when I got it I kind of

374
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:30,519
was like what is this weird plastic

375
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,919
grinder thing and then when I saw cuz

376
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:33,879
here's the thing about stores and Boll

377
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:35,559
this is the mighty vaporizer here these

378
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:38,480
guys kind of don't [ __ ] around when it

379
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:40,919
comes to uh like efficiency uh they're

380
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,920
they're German of course and uh I I was

381
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:44,559
like I saw the little plastic grinder I

382
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:46,919
thought I'm not really sure I'd ever use

383
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:49,000
this and then when I saw how it fit into

384
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:51,120
the unit I was like that's some smart

385
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,919
[ __ ] so as long as you don't open it

386
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,360
upside down which I've got the stone D I

387
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:56,958
did it the first time actually I'm not

388
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,199
going to lie so I wanted to ask you

389
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:02,518
quickly about your feelings in in

390
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:05,439
regards to uh Harper being gone and

391
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:07,560
Trudeau being in well you know I think

392
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,959
I'm so stoked to see Harper gone I

393
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:10,479
thought there was a possibility still

394
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:12,599
might hold in CU he has such a solid

395
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,560
base but uh pretty clear of that all the

396
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:18,440
new voters out there uh um picked up the

397
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:20,479
torch and got him out uh Trudeau you

398
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:22,639
know like I had been a pretty stun

399
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,199
Trudeau support up until he supported BC

400
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:27,639
51 and then it was hard for me to do it

401
00:15:25,198 --> 00:15:29,198
you know um I think I you know I think

402
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:30,680
it would have been that it would a

403
00:15:29,198 --> 00:15:32,159
little bit more NDP influenc I don't

404
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:34,758
think Justin's a bad guy I think he made

405
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:37,198
a mistake on c-51 got bad advice

406
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:39,000
pressure uh um you know that was a hard

407
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:40,519
call on the on the Canadian public you

408
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,519
know the reality is when you're a

409
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:44,759
politician at that level if you don't

410
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:47,000
make some uh personal compromises in

411
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:48,600
your world viiew then you're probably

412
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,759
not going to get to be prime minister of

413
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:53,319
this country right you know what I mean

414
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:56,360
uh um so you know I was disappointed in

415
00:15:53,318 --> 00:15:57,719
the c-51 uh um talk and stuff like that

416
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,800
but I think he's you know I think he's a

417
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,959
decent human being I think you know seen

418
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:03,318
him in personally seemed like he had a

419
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:05,799
good vibe and uh you know spent a lot of

420
00:16:03,318 --> 00:16:08,000
time here in BC and I think he's honest

421
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:09,679
about legalization I'm worried that

422
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,839
under the libs it might be a little bit

423
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:13,078
too corporate for most people you know

424
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,880
uh um and I would have liked to have

425
00:16:13,078 --> 00:16:17,439
seen the NDP there for that to kind of

426
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:19,000
make sure of a more of a kind of smaller

427
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,440
business and stuff like that who knows

428
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,559
you know what I mean and he seemed to be

429
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:24,199
supportive of dispensaries he seemed and

430
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:25,638
he said the personal growing comments

431
00:16:24,198 --> 00:16:26,919
when you know we compared to brewing

432
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:28,318
your own beer when he was talking about

433
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:30,639
medical marijuana and I'm hoping that

434
00:16:28,318 --> 00:16:32,240
pulls through for uh things and you know

435
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:35,440
like if we have some sort of model poose

436
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:37,000
to what we have for liquor with uh um

437
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:40,759
restaurants and things like that having

438
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,879
some liquor licenses and uh craft beer

439
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:45,839
and uh um Cottage wine industry as well

440
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:47,078
as the big things then that would

441
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,639
probably you know keep most people

442
00:16:47,078 --> 00:16:50,638
pretty happy I tell you what though

443
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,360
looking at Oregon when I was just down

444
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,759
there on the weekend in Portland

445
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:57,120
legalization just looks so fabulous you

446
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:59,560
know what I mean you see like Billboards

447
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:02,799
uh uh with you know gum cannabis bears

448
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:04,480
and opening of new dispensaries and uh

449
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:06,359
and then picking up newspapers the

450
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,199
Georgia Straight style newspapers and

451
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:10,438
more than half the advertising is all

452
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:13,240
cannabis related you got to think about

453
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:15,439
how this affects the economy overall you

454
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:17,880
know I'm not talking pizza sales it

455
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:19,959
always has affected the economy overall

456
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,959
people it was just in this sort of

457
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:23,519
underground that it was squeezing into

458
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:25,240
the economy in places that people

459
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:26,000
couldn't really see clearly and I think

460
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,679
now that

461
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,319
it's yeah now that it's lifted up out of

462
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:31,919
those sort of Shadows that we'll be able

463
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:34,879
to see that very thing I was talking

464
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:36,640
about it earlier when airports and uh

465
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,520
you know infrastructure and all these

466
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,679
things start actually getting produced

467
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:42,440
here in Canada from taxes that were paid

468
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:44,200
on Canada that's right that's right you

469
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,960
know and it's it's going to be a huge

470
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:48,480
boom you know what I mean Colorado's

471
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:51,360
already making a 100 million bucks you

472
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,480

Canada has uh on cannabis and cannabis

558
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:39,079
uh you know legalization versus the uh

559
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:40,918
the prohibition of it should be a good

560
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:43,000
question to ask them if they come around

561
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:44,759

the full 45 seconds that you're used to

599

[ __ ] no the two legistic quick but yeah

850
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:02,719
the dry pipe too such a nice piece I was

851
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:05,119
like I probably should have gone and put

852
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:06,639
a little salt water in but I think this

853
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:08,838
there was a weird like water not

854
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:11,159
suitable for swimming sign so I figured

855
00:35:08,838 --> 00:35:12,639
if it's not suitable for for swimming

856
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:15,358
should put we probably shouldn't filter

857
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:17,879
things through our lungs I'm see all

858
