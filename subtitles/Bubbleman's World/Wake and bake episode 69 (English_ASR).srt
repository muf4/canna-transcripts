arrested at the bel-air mansion put on

92
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:49,590
bail and told that if he used cannabis

93
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:51,688
while he was out he would have they

94
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:53,908
would take his mother's house away who

95
00:03:51,688 --> 00:03:55,888

96

Peter suffered from non-hodgkins

97
00:03:55,889 --> 00:04:00,419
lymphoma and unfortunately he passed

98
00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:03,419
away by choking on his own vomit as he

99
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:05,939

00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:30,439
the chat and about the whole

130
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:34,100
wake-and-bake episode really makes me

131
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:36,319
want to continue on I I was stupid to

132
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:38,450
pick this this spot it's beside my house

133
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:40,009
probably if I just jumped off the

134
00:05:38,449 --> 00:05:43,819
internet connection it would have been

135
00:05:40,009 --> 00:05:46,250
much better but apologies guys not the

136
00:05:43,819 --> 00:05:48,560
smartest move from the bubble man today

137
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:50,120
so I'm just gonna have a quick rip maybe

138
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,220
we'll call it a day nice quick

139
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:55,180
five-minute we can make session we don't

140
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:55,180
all have to be 45

141
00:05:57,329 --> 00:06:01,589
oh I know Jeff it's just the whole

142
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:04,680
conversation so it becomes kind of like

143
00:06:01,589 --> 00:06:07,049
why bother kind of becomes like maybe I

144
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:09,240
should have just like take a quick rip

145
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:10,829
and end this I always try to just I feel

146
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,090
like a responsibility every day but it's

147
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:14,068
getting to the point where you know what

148
00:06:12,089 --> 00:06:16,408
maybe a 5-10 minute one is worth it when

149
00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:18,360
it's just not I mean my phone is

150
00:06:16,408 --> 00:06:20,459
flashing very bad connection

151
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,110
very bad connection but unfortunately I

152
00:06:20,459 --> 00:06:24,089
have so much stuff here that it would be

153
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:26,669
impossible for me to move everything and

154
00:06:24,089 --> 00:06:28,318
we'll just have to push through get a

155
00:06:26,668 --> 00:06:32,430
couple of bong rips out of the way if

156
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:34,199
possible and yeah good stuff John great

157
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:35,879
you know here's the bottom line whether

158
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:39,629
it's a really bad connection or a good

159
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:41,370
connection suck it up and deal with it

160
00:06:39,629 --> 00:06:43,169
there's no really reason to make the

161
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:44,550
whole chat about how bad or good the

162
00:06:43,168 --> 00:06:46,348
connection is let's just talk about

163
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:48,030
something I'm here for maybe five more

164
00:06:46,348 --> 00:06:49,949
minutes if you guys have questions if

165
00:06:48,029 --> 00:06:53,239
you guys want to get into some hashish

166
00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:53,240
talk if you want to have a bowl

167
00:07:04,829 --> 00:07:10,959
that's what I'm saying let's let's not

168
00:07:07,149 --> 00:07:13,239
worry too much about the lag on the

169
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:14,560
connection otherwise it kind of hijacks

170
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,329
the conversation and then all we're

171
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,850
talking about is the connection can you

172
00:07:16,329 --> 00:07:22,000
kind of see the value of like we could

173
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:25,540
be talking about hash dry sifting bond

174
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:29,050
ripping bubble hash making curing

175
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:30,760
sieving micro planing proper curing of

176
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:33,639
the plant material to gear it up and get

177
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:35,620
ready for hash making so much yeah

178
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:39,129
Vinnie you know what the whining really

179
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:41,649
just it hijacks the conversation and it

180
00:07:39,129 --> 00:07:47,980
changes the vibe as you can tell I'm

181
00:07:41,649 --> 00:07:50,709
slightly annoyed glad that it's working

182
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:52,360
out now that's wonderful we were patient

183
00:07:50,709 --> 00:07:55,329
and it went away and now we have a

184
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:57,550
decent connection so let's have are you

185
00:07:55,329 --> 00:08:00,189
a certified legend no I'm definitely not

186
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:02,740
a legend I'm not the king I'm not the

187
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:05,170
Prince I'm not anything that's anywhere

188
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:08,620
above anyone else I sit at the same

189
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:16,660
level ground level with everyone else I

190
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:18,970
am a humble servant of Job well I would

191
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:21,460
offer you some advice if you're asking a

192
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:24,550
question say in a chat room with 200

193
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:26,279
people put the person's name in front of

194
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:28,860
the question then and then they'll know

195
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:31,479
who you're asking the question - I

196
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:33,460
assume all the questions are asked being

197
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:35,349
asked to me as I'm just trying to answer

198
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:36,759
them but if it's not for me just put the

199
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:41,050
other person's name in there and we'll

200
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:42,519
hammer it out pretty good well long did

201
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:43,839
you drive the herb to make hash well it

202
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:46,439
really depends on which herb you're

203
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,440
talking about

204
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:56,100
did I forget my of course I did of

205
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:58,860
course I did I don't know what Alex QC

206
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:01,649
is on Instagram but I'm sure we could

207
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:05,370
get him to answer us easy enough are you

208
00:09:01,649 --> 00:09:08,699
there Alex are you there my brother if

209

to connect on Instagram and of course on

216
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:28,440
BC bubbleman and mafioso no I'm

217
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:30,330
definitely not a mafioso interesting

218

question though yeah throw up your

219
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:36,840
instagrams I'm going to clean my bowl I

220
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:40,379
went to get my q-tips there so I could

221
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:42,060
clean out the Chazz not that there's any

222
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:47,429
Chazz right now it's actually pretty

223
00:09:42,059 --> 00:09:50,129
clean it's actually pretty clean X

224
00:09:47,429 --> 00:09:52,620
double XL is definitely a serious bowl

225
00:09:50,129 --> 00:09:54,120
to clean whoa what about that's

226
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:56,669
something that's never happened before I

227
00:09:54,120 --> 00:10:00,860
ended up getting resin all over my

228
00:09:56,669 --> 00:10:03,779
finger cleaning that she was a dirty one

229
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:05,970
all right so what's everyone up to on

230
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:09,120
this beautiful Monday afternoon

231
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:11,399
oh Vitor is taking off on us

232
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:15,029
peace out Vitor any tips when your

233
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:16,409
bubble doesn't full melt I love this

234
00:10:15,029 --> 00:10:18,269
question doesn't pool melt and kind of

235
00:10:16,409 --> 00:10:21,659
gets black and burns yeah Cuban chronic

236
00:10:18,269 --> 00:10:24,480
I got a great hint for you grow better

237
00:10:21,659 --> 00:10:26,879
weed bro that's bunk I'm not trying to

238
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,889
be mean but for real dude if your shits

239
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:30,029
burning black and it's not melting I

240
00:10:28,889 --> 00:10:31,799
mean the bags are the Word of God

241
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:33,990
they're basically telling you that what

242
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:37,740
you've grown or what whoever's grown

243
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:39,930
that you've accessed is no bueno no

244
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:41,460
bueno no bueno no bueno it's amazing how

245
00:10:39,929 --> 00:10:43,199
many people ask that question hey how do

246
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:46,139
I get mine my bubble to melt it's not

247
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,570
melting and the answer obviously it

248
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:50,399
sounds terrible nobody is excited to

249
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:52,470
hear well you have to grow better weed

250
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,600
but it's a very important message to

251
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:56,160
learn from the bags when you put

252
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,360
something in that you think is great and

253
00:10:56,159 --> 00:11:00,269
it doesn't come out great

254
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:03,180
the bags are the Word of God the

255
00:11:00,269 --> 00:11:07,049
eggs are the pump you are wrong and the

256
00:11:03,179 --> 00:11:09,059
bags are right so how you got that

257
00:11:07,049 --> 00:11:11,549
bubble to burn black is incredible

258
00:11:09,059 --> 00:11:13,289
because often the food the salts do not

259
00:11:11,549 --> 00:11:14,939
really transfer into the glandular

260
00:11:13,289 --> 00:11:18,959
trichomes head the things that would

261
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:20,580
make the the ash black on herb for

262
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,830
instance are salts in the plant matter

263
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:24,960
that don't really contaminate the

264
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:27,450
glandular head meaning I have taken

265
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,980
glandular heads from organic material

266
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:30,810
that was grown outside but was never

267
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:34,850
properly flushed and so the material

268
00:11:30,809 --> 00:11:37,289
burned very dark and I ended up taking

269
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:38,909
that same sweet skunk and turning it

270
00:11:37,289 --> 00:11:41,549
into hash and the dry sift and the wet

271
00:11:38,909 --> 00:11:44,309
wash was really nice it smoked smooth so

272
00:11:41,549 --> 00:11:45,509
I don't know if the person that you got

273
00:11:44,309 --> 00:11:47,429
that material from was spraying

274
00:11:45,509 --> 00:11:50,250
chemicals on it to make it burn black

275
00:11:47,429 --> 00:11:52,229
like that but definitely that doesn't

276
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:54,000
sound good and if it's not melty if your

277
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:55,889
bubble doesn't stick together if it's

278
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,129
not if it's just like sand that falls

279
00:11:55,889 --> 00:12:01,350
apart it's low-quality its you've grown

280
00:11:59,129 --> 00:12:03,600
what I like to call Tootsie Pops which

281
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:06,000
are you know those little lollipops that

282
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,649
are a thick candy coating and then a

283
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,080
tiny little bit of the goodness in the

284
00:12:07,649 --> 00:12:12,090
inside we don't want to see pops we want

285
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:14,370
water balloons we want water balloons

286
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:16,740
that are blown up so big they're about

287
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:19,679
to burst because the balloon itself is

288
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:21,659
as thin as it could possibly get and on

289
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:23,339
the inside the water that would

290
00:12:21,659 --> 00:12:25,620
represent the cannabinoids and the

291
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:28,320
terpenes and they the profiles that we

292
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:30,450
seek so most people are focused on

293
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,550
vegetative growth they are focused on

294
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:34,290
vegetative yields how much can I get and

295
00:12:32,549 --> 00:12:37,319
how fast can I get it and unfortunately

296
00:12:34,289 --> 00:12:40,319
because of that the resin tends to pay

297
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:42,840
the price the integrity of the quality

298
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,900
it pays the price you can still take it

299
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:49,610
and purify it to 99.9% heads but if the

300
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:52,919
resin heads are Tootsie Pops instead of

301
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:54,690
water balloons you can see and trust me

302
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:57,120
most people are growing the Tootsie Pops

303
00:12:54,690 --> 00:13:00,030
I'm telling you and it's just like thick

304
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,980
wax heads with a tiny little bit of oil

305
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:04,409
on the inside and that wax tends to burn

306
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:06,690
a little darker it doesn't melt the same

307
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:08,669
way as the oil it's just not what we're

308
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:12,270
looking for it's the carrier it's kind

309
00:13:08,669 --> 00:13:13,919
of the pizza box and that's that's my

310
00:13:12,269 --> 00:13:16,679
metaphor for today maybe one more

311
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:19,708
bong rip we are having before we head

312
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:21,419
off all right does anyone regulate the

313
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:23,879
thickness of the wax head during growth

314
00:13:21,419 --> 00:13:25,889
does anything regulate the thickness yes

315
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:28,860
luster burn I'd suggest that it's

316
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:33,149
regulated by the ability of the grower

317
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:35,669
and the genetics of the plant to express

318
00:13:33,149 --> 00:13:37,769
itself perfectly so it needs to express

319
00:13:35,669 --> 00:13:39,750
its terpene and cannabinoid profile to

320
00:13:37,769 --> 00:13:41,310
perfection and in order to do that all

321
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:44,070
the variables have to line up

322
00:13:41,309 --> 00:13:44,489
I've had many companies tell me for

323
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:46,800
instance

324
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:48,509
Ramos company talking about nutrients

325
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:51,448
and getting the plant what it needs to

326
00:13:48,509 --> 00:13:53,250
grow into this massive structure a night

327
00:13:51,448 --> 00:13:55,319
I said listen if you really want to

328
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:57,179
focus on a nutrient company if you

329
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:59,820
understand the science that phenols

330
00:13:57,179 --> 00:14:01,528
phenols and terpenes hydrocarbons and

331
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:03,410
alcohols are the building blocks for all

332
00:14:01,528 --> 00:14:06,419
of the cannabinoids and terpenoids

333
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:08,100
inside the glandular head then why don't

334
00:14:06,419 --> 00:14:11,129
we try to come up with a food that can

335
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:13,769
somehow manipulate or increase those

336
00:14:11,129 --> 00:14:15,509
levels of production in the plant

337
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:17,339
because if we can produce more building

338
00:14:15,509 --> 00:14:20,370
blocks more hydrocarbons and phenols

339
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:22,199
terpenes and FINA alcohols that pump up

340
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:23,789
into the upper membrane of the head the

341
00:14:22,198 --> 00:14:27,240
fibrous mat that cooks those

342
00:14:23,789 --> 00:14:30,360
cannabinoids into being if we can raise

343
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:32,190
those levels to me that is a point of

344
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:36,360
interest much more than trying to raise

345
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:37,589
the levels of growing you know oh the

346
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,149
troll hammer who do we have to get rid

347
00:14:37,589 --> 00:14:41,209
of you just tell me what's his name I'll

348
00:14:39,149 --> 00:14:44,129
get rid of this [ __ ]

349
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:48,509

00:15:01,049 --> 00:15:06,328
three-year-old overweight balding man in

356
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:10,619
his mom's basement sending out those

357
00:15:06,328 --> 00:15:13,528
links the troll King too bad the troll

358

see one I'll pay attention now I'm on

363
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:28,730
the spam hunt so

364
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,320
we'll make sure if we see anymore that

365
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:32,690
it's kind of funny though like that that

366
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:35,060
people are coming on here and and doing

367
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:36,620
that did you hear about the biochemist

368
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:37,969
who implanted th see developing genes

369
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:39,679
into citrus fruit and able to grow

370
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:42,649
oranges with THC doesn't surprise me

371
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:45,919
definitely heard about yeast was another

372
00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:48,708
one ah Thank You Celeste steel gardener

373
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:51,189
I hope I've been a good one sorry for

374
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:53,599
being such a human and fallible but

375
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:56,209
that's the way it is hey there's Betty

376
00:15:53,600 --> 00:16:01,420
looks like Betty is also looking to get

377
00:15:56,208 --> 00:16:07,088
locked out on the goodbye Betty alright

378
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:07,088
no more that it is the Internet

379
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:14,629
well yes or no it depends on what kinds

380
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:16,969
of trichome there is a quality

381
00:16:14,629 --> 00:16:20,240
difference there's a profile difference

382
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:22,610
in different types of trichome heads now

383
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,049
you know there are articles that'll tell

384
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:25,759
you there's six different types of

385
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:27,588
trichome heads but really what they're

386
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,800
talking about is cystal if hairs and

387
00:16:27,589 --> 00:16:31,790
other really what I call non glandular

388
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:34,278
components so really there are three

389
00:16:31,789 --> 00:16:36,049
trichomes that we're looking for and

390
00:16:34,278 --> 00:16:38,509
really only two that I'm looking for now

391
00:16:36,049 --> 00:16:40,458
from a medicinal standpoint absolutely I

392
00:16:38,509 --> 00:16:42,589
would always not leave the other ones

393
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:46,250
behind the bulbous heads the ones that

394
00:16:42,589 --> 00:16:48,949
are less appropriate for the smoker the

395
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:50,690
connoisseur but that have great relief

396
00:16:48,948 --> 00:16:52,789
for people with different elements

397
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:54,709
Crohn's and cancers and pain related

398
00:16:52,789 --> 00:16:56,809
diseases there are you know different

399
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:58,879
cannabinoid profiles in the bulbous

400
00:16:56,809 --> 00:17:02,000
heads as from the sessile and the

401
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:06,439
capitate stalked and so you know the

402
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:08,000
smoker generally looks for something

403
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:09,890
along the lines of a sessile or a

404
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,599
capitate stock and the bulbous are these

405
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:13,730
little ones that are stuck to the leaf

406
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:16,129
and these ones are the ones that beef up

407
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:19,419
the oil returns and make it seem like

408
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:19,419
Bubble returns are small

409
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:40,529
yeah I don't know about that natural

410
00:17:38,009 --> 00:17:41,690
pine bug spray I've heard all sorts of

411
00:17:40,529 --> 00:17:45,680
things

412
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:48,059
remember Remo was using the turbinator

413
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:50,220
but I'm thinking that it was producing a

414
00:17:48,059 --> 00:17:51,569
much higher you know those things need

415
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:57,420
to be grown and very very

416
00:17:51,569 --> 00:17:59,039
environmentally controlled rooms where

417
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:05,279
you have scientists kind of writing down

418
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:07,259
all the information really keeping track

419
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:09,539
of things and the reason I say scientist

420
00:18:07,259 --> 00:18:11,819
is because you're gonna need some gas

421
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:14,279
chromatograph some HPLC you're gonna

422
00:18:11,819 --> 00:18:17,569
need to do some work where you test

423
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:21,029
these materials before during and after

424
00:18:17,569 --> 00:18:23,009
I'm just not into taking anyone's word I

425
00:18:21,029 --> 00:18:28,440
love the idea I got a company got in

426
00:18:23,009 --> 00:18:29,519
touch with me recently soil I don't want

427
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,990
to mix up their name but this soil

428
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:34,859
company got in touch made and producing

429
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:38,849
living soils beneficial microbes the

430
00:18:34,859 --> 00:18:40,979
whole nine yards probiotics and they

431
00:18:38,849 --> 00:18:43,919
have a claim that they're also raising

432
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:46,039
oh sorry Clara Olson just saw you there

433
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:48,840
let me block you real quick you thought

434
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:50,730
they just mentioned that they were going

435
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:52,139
to be releasing a product I don't know

436
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:54,660
if it's in the soil but that basically

437
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:56,940
can manipulate terpene levels and raise

438
00:18:54,660 --> 00:19:00,960
terpene levels so once again I never

439
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:02,220
really really trust um yeah I knew you

440
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,840
guys would get a hold of that listen

441
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:06,150
alright I get a kick out of that I'm

442
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:08,669
kind of the class clown I'll often say

443
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:11,550
little things for a laugh so it's a

444
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:12,930
punchline it's like a comedian so please

445
00:19:11,549 --> 00:19:14,789
don't ever get offended with me I

446
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:16,440
sometimes you guys send me emails like

447
00:19:14,789 --> 00:19:18,779
that I've embarrassed you in chat

448
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:20,759
there's no embarrassing anyone in chat I

449
00:19:18,779 --> 00:19:22,319
think you're all great I'm not trying to

450
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:25,109
embarrass anyone and don't be worried

451
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:26,639
about being liked shown to be wrong or

452
00:19:25,109 --> 00:19:29,549
something don't let your ego and your

453
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,770
insecurities attack you from your inner

454
00:19:29,549 --> 00:19:33,210
self it's okay to be wrong it's how I

455
00:19:31,769 --> 00:19:36,029
learned almost everything that I know

456
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:37,329
today and that means I had to be wrong a

457
00:19:36,029 --> 00:19:39,460
lot of the time

458
00:19:37,329 --> 00:19:41,500
to get this kind of knowledge stacked up

459
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:45,190
particularly in regards to cannabis

460
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:47,019
knowledge I had to be wrong a lot to get

461
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:48,880
to the level that I'm at now people ask

462
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:50,710
me how do you take such great photos I'm

463
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,690
like well you're only seeing the great

464
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:55,210
photo and not the ten thousand shitty

465
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:58,690
ones that I took before the great photo

466
00:19:55,210 --> 00:20:00,670
so valuable mistakes instead of costly

467
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:03,220
or sorry valuable lessons instead of

468
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:05,110
costly mistakes the boats gettin picked

469
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:07,089
up tomorrow I am going to get the boat

470

472
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:12,580
she just put up hearts I have a feeling

473
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,589
she's gonna pull some spam action on us

474
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:17,409
and you know what we can't be having

475
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:21,789
that we are getting some serious sex

spam going on today oh I got her thank
