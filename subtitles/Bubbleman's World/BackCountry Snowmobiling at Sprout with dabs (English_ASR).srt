2
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:24,959
hey guys welcome to Bubble man's world I

3
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:26,880
am freshly back from Jamaica and instead

4
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,880
of uploading all the Jamaican videos as

5
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:30,559
I would normally do after a trip what

6
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:32,118
I've noticed is after I've uploaded four

7
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:34,320
or five or six of them you guys tend to

8
00:00:32,118 --> 00:00:36,439
get a little bored and the views go uh

9
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,119
substantially down and uh I want the

10
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:40,599
Jamaican videos to get some nice views

11
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:41,878
so I thought I would intermix the videos

12
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,640
that I

13
00:00:41,878 --> 00:00:46,878
do in between uploading the Jamaican

14
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,119
videos so first off I wanted to start

15
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:50,759
with

16
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:53,439
saying a very happy birthday to my good

17
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:56,000
buddy Johnny B uh it is his birthday

18
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:58,599
today we usually celebrated in Amsterdam

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,840
but today uh you know we're in Canada so

20
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:03,920
I'm hoping on seeing him later on on for

21
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,760
some birthday Puffs and for now what I'm

22
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,040
planning on doing is I've loaded up my

23
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,400
sled I'm actually sweating like a maniac

24
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:13,040
I got my Leafa on ready for the winter

25
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,000
out there and my my old crew from up in

26
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,320
Whistler Ryan and Dave some great guys

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,560
have called me up and they've said we're

28
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:21,478
going to go sledding today it is early

29
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,240
the mountain only opened up yesterday

30
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:25,280
but uh you know if the Mountain's good

31
00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:26,920
to ski on the Mountain's good to sled on

32
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,359

uh just the day after I landed actually

55
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:21,518
I'm not sure if you guys can see that

56
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:25,120
but you see the quality on that there

57
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:27,519

bubble hash right there and I got to

59

give it up to those West Coast

60
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:32,000
concentrate crew you know I always think

61
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,480
of them as a solventless Company the

62
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,199
company does make a lot of BHO and other

63
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:39,799
things but these particular guys um Adam

64
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:41,399
and Brett and Phil they're really on the

65
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,959
solventless quiver so they've got the

66
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,000
dry sift they've got the rosin they've

67
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:48,039
got the wet wash and uh you know really

68
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,759

69
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:52,280
so uh my hats off to all of you guys

70

73
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,719
you know you give it a tiny little bit

74
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,480
of a finger

75
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:07,359
and uh you get

76
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:08,719
that so very nice very nice little dab a

77
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,480
doodle I'm sure someone's going to

78
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:14,280
comment on how my finger was dirty

79
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:17,359
but I'm smoking it so don't worry about

80
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,439
it we're doing this Whistler thing today

81
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,400
and we're going to be in the Whistler

82
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:22,318
Back Country so we won't be on Whistler

83
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,158
Mountain obviously uh They Don't Really

84
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:27,639
uh they frown a little bit upon taking

85
00:03:25,158 --> 00:03:29,239
sleds onto the mountain but uh we'll be

86
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:31,919
across the street actually either on

87
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:33,959
Brandy or Sprout so who knows maybe

88
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:36,199
we'll see some of you guys out there and

89
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:40,519
uh let's have this hit and start making

90
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:40,518
our way up to Whistler shall

91
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:01,479
we yummy

92
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:10,239
all

93
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:20,399
right wakey wakey now that we bakey

94
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:20,399
let's get on with the show see you

95
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:30,959
there well we just went by Furry Creek

96
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,959
with which is actually the golf course

97
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:34,638
where Adam Sandler and Bob Barker got

98
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:36,758
into the fight in the movie Happy

99
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,400
Gilmore kind of wanted to film that for

100
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:39,600
you guys uh hopefully on the way back

101
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:41,719
it'll still be light out and I'll be

102
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,360
able to just film going by it and add it

103
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,919
into this little spot because uh ah it's

104
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,919
a cool spot when you see the hole and

105
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:51,359
recognize it right by the ocean there a

106
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:51,359
lot of you might have thought it was a a

107
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:59,719
lake so this is the last little spot

108
00:04:55,959 --> 00:05:01,000
right before Squamish so the Pacific

109
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,680
ocean which you could probably barely

110
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,319
see just ends up here and then there's

111
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,519
the glacier in the background up there

112
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:08,159
and I guess soon we'll come around the

113
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:10,279
corner and we'll see Diamond Head as

114
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,080
well and then we'll be into the uh

115
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:14,839
Tantalus mountain range Tantalus

116
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:16,959
mountain range has been in countless

117
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:19,399
snowboard and ski videos as well as sled

118
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:21,198
videos for that matter it's a pretty

119
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:24,000
epic Mountains they're very European

120
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:26,160
esque very pointy and sharp uh not quite

121
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,600
like the ones you see up around Whistler

122
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,759
and and blackholm which are a lot more

123
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,240
rounded out even though you you can find

124
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,720
some peaked out mountains up at Brandy

125
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:37,000
Wine that look uh almost French

126
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,319
Alish line up here I'm not sure you guys

127
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,759
are going to be able to catch it I'll

128
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:41,520
try to give you a little shot of it yeah

sees the gray aliens in the silhouette

135
00:05:52,240 --> 00:06:00,360

335
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:16,759
don't all right we got up to the top

336
00:22:12,038 --> 00:22:16,759
time for a beer and a puff yeah bro

337
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:25,319
woo oh yeah it's such tractiony riding

338
00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:27,038
nice to find some no crust somewhere but

339
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:29,558
I don't think that's happening and I had

340
00:22:27,038 --> 00:22:31,038
no idea like really well going up there

341
00:22:29,558 --> 00:22:34,519
I saw you got little bus and then you

342
00:22:31,038 --> 00:22:35,839
got on top and hit it again nice that's

343
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:37,798
what you need to do because if you just

344
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:39,519
give up every time that happens you'll

345
00:22:37,798 --> 00:22:41,119
be [ __ ] you see I ended up on the

346
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:42,720
wrong side of the slope down there too I

347
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:44,158
had to tweak it around yeah know I saw

348
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,558
that you're doing really

349
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:48,278
well you have to be a little aggressive

350
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:50,200
for sure are these your first days or

351
00:22:48,278 --> 00:22:52,640
what uh first day of the season but

352
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:54,798
you've been sledding for some years no

353
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:58,799

500 on Sunny Beach days oh yeah yeah

355
00:22:58,798 --> 00:23:02,879
sort of this is that's a bit bump I

356
00:23:01,038 --> 00:23:04,240
think I'm only three three years in

357
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,640
maybe or four

358

maximum and he hasn't been riding that's

359
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:11,720
on her own either so definitely it's a

360
00:23:09,278 --> 00:23:24,848
bit more oomph than the

00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:40,158
hit hey Elena got some water here back

499
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:43,200
this and then maybe a little juice after

500
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:46,278
that it's 100 times better in

501
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,798
there 100 times better you think I did

502
00:30:46,278 --> 00:30:50,440
the calculation I think it was somewhere

503
00:30:47,798 --> 00:30:52,960
around that somewhere around that all

504
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:55,200
right cameraman should I stop filming or

505
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:58,120
I'll just take the

506
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:00,639
camera oh Greg can I steal some of that

507
00:30:58,119 --> 00:31:03,038
there you go dab that in not in the hole

508
00:31:00,638 --> 00:31:03,038
but in the

509
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:07,960
moat oh

510
00:31:05,638 --> 00:31:09,278
yeah a little hard on your nerves right

511
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,960
this is this is what we're talking about

512
00:31:09,278 --> 00:31:12,359
right

513
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:15,038
here proper dabbing did you get it a

514
00:31:12,359 --> 00:31:16,678
little bit you want to hit some there

515
00:31:15,038 --> 00:31:18,240
probably some smoke still in there yeah

516
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:20,440
and then just drop the rest of the dab

517
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,440
in

518
00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:24,880
too and we'll cover it

519
00:31:23,038 --> 00:31:26,000
too now let's get you a fresh one

520
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:29,519
careful that's hot don't touch your

521
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,519
finger around there

522
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:38,080
got

523
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:42,120
a you know what let's decide when we get

524
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:43,839
there [ __ ] uh put you on a of me

525
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:46,959
remember you were saying like it's even

526
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:49,278
like difficult these guys are gone as

527
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,679
long as you put the right line there's a

528
00:31:49,278 --> 00:31:52,440
there's just a bit of a ridge in one

529
00:31:50,679 --> 00:31:53,278
spot but if you going on the WR side of

530
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:56,038
it you're going

531
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:58,398
to but you guys punch the line they got

532
00:31:56,038 --> 00:31:59,839
a line in there's no track

533
00:31:58,398 --> 00:32:02,798
you're the first track there's nobody

534
00:31:59,839 --> 00:32:04,879
there just follow someone down and just

535
00:32:02,798 --> 00:32:06,398
stay in the track right and then when

536
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,720
you're down the bottom you can decide if

537
00:32:06,398 --> 00:32:10,398
you want to try it or not and uh one of

538
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:13,079
us will go behind you and if you can't

539
00:32:10,398 --> 00:32:14,439
do it you'll come up with one of us get

540
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:17,319
and not like one of us will take your

541
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:18,440
side off it's not a problem we'll get

542
00:32:17,319 --> 00:32:21,200
her

543
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:23,720
done it's I like how BR the snow it's

544
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:25,159
different not the same it does have a

545
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,798
crust but not like this it doesn't get

546
00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:28,919
the sun it doesn't get the late day sun

547
00:32:26,798 --> 00:32:30,558
because of the bowl there day sun now

548
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:32,038
but it's not it must be not getting the

549
00:32:30,558 --> 00:32:34,319
early or something cuz it's definitely

550
00:32:32,038 --> 00:32:34,319
not as

551
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:42,480
crusty point is like even me I'm like

552
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:45,798
destroyed

553
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:49,399

00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:25,638
problem and if somebody struggles we got

566
