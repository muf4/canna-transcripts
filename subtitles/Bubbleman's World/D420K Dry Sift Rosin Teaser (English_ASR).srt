[Music]

2
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:25,679
hey guys welcome to Bubble man's world

3
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:27,359
uh got a special guest in today d420 K

4
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:29,039
and uh this is kind of a little teaser

5
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,039
video that we're going to give you uh

6
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,439
Darren's been uh anxious anxious to get

7
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:37,600
some of his sift pressed up here into

8
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:40,199
some rosin uh he's uh his denail press

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,039
is still on uh the back order but uh I

10
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,480
guess what we're going to do is we're

11
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:44,079
going to give them a little taste give

12
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:46,159
you a little taste and then we're going

13
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,480
to film an actual like full video where

14
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:51,000
you have uh I've got this is this is

15
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:53,159
some jars that we got put aside for it

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,920
but I got about the same amount of jars

17
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:57,718
as well to do double that amount pretty

18
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,879
much we'll pull out the big preps right

19
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:00,320
now I just thought because it was a

20
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:02,358
short video and I didn't want to have

21
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,959
this giant thing blocking us here on the

22
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:06,280
uh on the couch figured we pull out the

23
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:08,559
small unit cuz you haven't even tried

24
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:10,280
the small unit yet no I haven't no no I

25
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,719
want I want every one of the units

26
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:14,599
though just because they're they're

27
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:16,599
tools I like it's like a mechanic a

28
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:18,199
heavy duty mechanic a hot rod mechanic

29
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:20,919
you got your tool chest I want these

30
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:23,680
tools for my [ __ ] shop yeah for your

31
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:25,680
quiver for your solventless hash quiver

32
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,960
you got all right well why don't we get

33
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,960
to it you got some beautiful NL yeah

34
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:34,599
some Northern Lights me and

35
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:37,639
uh me and uh old Jakey this looks

36
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:40,719
beautiful it's it's really nice it was

37
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:42,519
uh it was the the screen of the 73

38
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:45,158
screen that before I really did much

39
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:47,239
sifting you know the that little trick

40
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:50,200
that you showed it's like a solid like

41
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:51,640
50 to 60% head I'd say yeah I'd see that

42
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,880
for sure looking at it under the

43
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:56,079
microscope it's you can see a lot of the

44
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:57,560
crystals all right well I guess we could

45
00:01:56,078 --> 00:01:59,959
load up a little pressing screen I've

46
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:02,280
got a little 25 micron screen here that

47
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:04,879
that uh we're just going to load up and

48
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,920
wrap up sort of been I guess the

49
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:08,519
technique that I found to be the

50
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,598
simplest so

51
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,280
far I'm sure lots of different people

52
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:14,079
are doing lots of different things but

53
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:16,479
uh too much oh no you can pack in a

54
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,920
whole whole whack more

55
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:21,000
good probably most of what's loose and

56
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:24,799
maybe even a bit

57
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,318
more okay let's bust a little bit looks

58
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:31,120
nice bust some of that loose one of my

59
00:02:27,318 --> 00:02:33,119
first Ros in videos was doing dry sift

60
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:38,280
and I haven't really come gone back to

61
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,280
it much since but uh here we

62
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:48,039
go beautiful more or less I think that's

63
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,360
a fine amount I mean it's hard to say

64
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:51,639
what that is like whether that's a

65
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,120
couple of grams or four grams or no

66
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:55,359
three maybe two I don't know well I find

67
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,280
the pure the the pure the heavier right

68
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,879
yeah yeah

69
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:02,878
totally for sure find out in a in a

70
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:06,079
blink here once a week uh as we press it

71
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:08,158
out so I like the idea of using a a

72
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,719
having a screen that's a little sticky

73
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:15,280
like this cuz it does make it a little

74
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:15,280
bit easier for closing it

75
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:24,959
up how big of a

76
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:27,679
piece um you know what if you P pull out

77
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,479
a little bit more there well it's about

78
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,560
like that and then I would just do two

79
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:35,000
of them and we'll put one on top and one

80
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:37,400
on the bottom okay I give this a tiny

81
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,280
little bit of prepress just to get it

82
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:42,360
sort

83
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,360
of ready for

84
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,400
business there's that Mothership on the

85
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:53,719
corner of the table again while we're

86
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:57,799
pressing little put one on the botom one

87
00:03:53,719 --> 00:04:01,079
on to then I guess here yeah all

88
00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:02,239
right here actually let's do this way go

89
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:05,280
like

90
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,680
this go like this kind of give it a

91
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,640
little bit of a press this way or

92
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:11,120
forward O Okay forward yep all right so

93
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:14,158
what this the first time I got to use

94
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,600
this thing happy dropping that on the

95
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:18,759
floor yeah this will be good you can you

96
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,600
can do well n spilled so but you're

97
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:23,479
right spilling it would would have been

98
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:25,080
damn damn near drug abuse so let's see

99
00:04:23,478 --> 00:04:27,039
what kind of a squeeze this gives off

100
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:31,560
it's not going to give us tons of room

101
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,560
on the side but we want to close it up

102
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,720
all right then it's got a timer that's

103
00:04:36,918 --> 00:04:42,839
set up on it you can leave it even for a

104
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:45,600
little bit longer on the than the timer

105
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:48,679
or you can open it up give it an open

106
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:52,879
it's coming out the size there we

107
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,879
go oh yeah look at

108
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:03,120
that wow we better press that again yeah

109
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,800
yeah in like in like for 5 seconds in

110
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,759
because it's so much it was coming out I

111
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,960
could see it see it on the pan there

112
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:12,800
yeah yeah I was like

113
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:14,680
whoa that is just beautiful [ __ ]

114
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,038
beautiful and we will press that again

115
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:19,720
let me just get that off for you drop it

116
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:22,399
there for a second to show these guys

117
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:24,800
what we just pulled out cuz of course

118
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:24,799
they want to

119
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:31,199
see let's see what we got here

120
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:33,359
you see that

121
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,960
guys it's kind of hard to tell you go

122
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,800
ahead and do it and then that one there

123
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:40,560
we go that looks absolutely beautiful

124
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,720
real nice color I'm going to give it a

125
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,959
little taste of course

126
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,440
Sweet let's get a little bit off this

127
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:51,439
pan here I've never actually had any

128
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:54,918
rosin on my might need a little bit of

129
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:57,478
uh parchment paper to wipe that

130
00:05:54,918 --> 00:06:00,439
clear Let It Burn get it off the let's

131
00:05:57,478 --> 00:06:03,120
see how well this collects too oh yeah

132
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:05,759
real nice real nice see got a collection

133
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,759
on that

134
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:13,759
mhm well that's enough for a

135
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:16,519
dab sir you go for it are you sure yep

136
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,520
gentleman and a

137
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:28,840
scholar this is thesis on uh bong

138
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:30,960
rip I said that loud almost scared me I

139
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:32,279
was like zoned right in on that hoot

140
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:35,279
just looking at the

141
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:35,279
Melt

142
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,960
wow

143
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:48,160
wow that is insanely

144
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:52,318
smooth how's the

145
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:55,400
flavor Northern lady growing growing oh

146
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:57,199
nice building nice came out literally so

147
00:06:55,399 --> 00:07:00,120
smooth now I can now I can feel that

148
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:02,840
grabbing

149
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:05,560
excellent and this has been curing for a

150
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:08,239
long time too holy [ __ ] man did that

151
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,240
come out

152
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,800
nice I get bet you we get a couple more

153
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:14,918
presses I think it would have been the

154
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:18,280
only thing now you see the difficulty of

155
00:07:14,918 --> 00:07:19,560
using a smaller unit you only have so

156
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:22,239
much

157
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:24,439
room for things to go

158
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,918
down so this time I think we should give

159
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:30,319
a 5sec

160
00:07:26,918 --> 00:07:32,000
press cleans up so nice hey

161
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:35,520
I'm going to grab the uh camera and show

162
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,160
them because uh oh man I want to be able

163
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:40,680
to really show

164
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,000
that without the Shadow and I keep

165
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:46,280

tonight yeah and [ __ ] check it out

191
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,480
like I haven't been to a heavy metal

192
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,360
concert in a while and we're pressed for

193
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,360
time and we want to have the proper

194
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,200
parchment paper so the fibers and that

195
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,079
sort of stuff that bubble man mentioned

196
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,720
in hash church on Sunday exactly we get

197
00:09:10,078 --> 00:09:15,000
the proper stuff cuz we want no

198
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,600
contaminant because this is

199
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,320
absolute solventless let's finish it off

200
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,040
with one more rip and I'm going to tell

201
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,720
you guys that I'm going to take macro

202
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:24,599
photographs of this and share it in the

203
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,920
video because I can tell already from my

204
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:30,600
naked eye the quality uh under the lens

205
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:32,879
is going to look r ridiculous because

206
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:36,040
bubble has creates a certain type type

207
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:38,639
of of look to the rosin dryft produces a

208
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:40,958
different type of uh rosin as does

209
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:42,799
flower rosin so you can see we still got

210
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:45,399
a really nice light color with a little

211
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:47,240
bit of darkness in there uh the flavor

212
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:49,320
and the the smoothness of the rip is

213
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:51,600
just unbelievable it's like we got rid

214
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:53,079
of everything that was harsh in there uh

215
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,040
then it sort of delays and comes and

216
00:09:53,078 --> 00:09:56,679
grabs you at the end but uh another do

217
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:59,639
another squish on it yeah let's squish

218
00:09:56,679 --> 00:10:01,599
it up do it up for sure

219
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:03,240
I knew you were going to love this thing

220
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:08,360
[ __ ] yeah

221
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:08,360
man careful of the mothership there you

222
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,639
bet can you hear it sizzling open her

223
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:25,600
up booah so you got a real nice uh yield

224
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:27,039
on that first one we're going to still

225
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,040
you could still do it a third time and

226
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:31,439
what I would do is tell you to fold that

227
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:33,240
in half half yes just fold it right in

228
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,480
half put it in between another piece of

229
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,839
parchment and that'll be the third one

230
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:39,480
that's the one I'll leave for like a

231
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:42,639
good little chunk of time yeah just fold

232
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:45,480
it right in half maybe even once more if

233
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:47,959
you want why not just to just to make a

234
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:50,120
smaller spot I mean the bottom line is

235
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:52,039
as it should for that you've got the the

236
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,919
power and the press to to squeeze that

237
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:55,399
out pretty good okay let's take this and

238
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:58,439
move it somewhere

239
00:10:55,399 --> 00:11:00,000
too sure to the edge of the table just

240
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:03,120
