1
00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:05,418
all right we are at the Magic Fountain

2
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:05,419
in Barcelona

3
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:11,699
came and came in 2004

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:15,500
Magic Fountain

5
00:00:11,699 --> 00:00:15,500
it's a really cool spot to hang out

6
00:00:16,138 --> 00:00:19,679
some epic buildings looks like it's all

7
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:22,519
turned off right now I think it turns on

8
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:22,519
at night but

9
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,300
cool nonetheless

10
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:43,900
[Music]

11
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:59,760
[Laughter]

12
00:00:43,899 --> 00:01:02,959
[Music]

13
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:02,960
oh my God

14
00:01:06,829 --> 00:01:34,599
[Music]

15
00:01:31,938 --> 00:01:55,618
thank you

16
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:57,969
[Music]

17
00:01:55,618 --> 00:02:01,159
thank you

18
00:01:57,969 --> 00:02:04,319
[Music]

19
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:05,579
I just walked around the Magic Fountain

20
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:07,500
here like I mentioned this is one of the

21
00:02:05,578 --> 00:02:09,659
first places I ever went to in Barcelona

22
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,818
at my first spanibus which was before

23
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:15,900
spanipus it was actually called la

24
00:02:11,818 --> 00:02:17,878
Fiera high life and a Gentleman born and

25
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,439
bred local to Barcelona said you must

26
00:02:17,878 --> 00:02:20,878
let me take you to some of my favorite

27
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:22,500
spots this is a beautiful spot

28
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:24,179
overlooking the city you can see

29
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:27,000
everything in the city in the background

30
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,920
it's really cool and then bring a tripod

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,020
however

32
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:34,139
there's a small possibility I can make

33
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:36,959
this work we'll see we'll see sometimes

34
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:38,579
life works sometimes it doesn't

35
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,400
I think we're gonna go for the it

36
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:43,319
doesn't methodology here

37
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,760
sort of it's pretty sketchy you could

38
00:02:43,318 --> 00:02:48,659
break my camera

39
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:52,039
let's try another option over here

40
00:02:48,659 --> 00:02:52,039
this one looks a little better maybe

41
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:03,179
oh is that sketchy

42
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:05,039
sometimes you gotta go with what you got

43
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:06,480
and right now sketch is all I got

44
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:07,979
although you know what I could put it on

45
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:10,079
this case I think and it would be a

46
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:12,419
little safer

47
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,000
pull this out

48
00:03:12,419 --> 00:03:17,579
Q-tips

49
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,318
we're gonna put this right on here I

50
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:24,200
think that's gonna be a little less

51
00:03:19,318 --> 00:03:24,199
sketchy maybe maybe not I don't know

52
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:29,579
pull out some of the flavors that we got

53
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:32,219
from the masters of rosin which have

54
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:35,280
been substantial and wonderful I'm not

55
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:38,840
sure that I brought my Dabber

56
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,840
pain in my butt if I haven't

57
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:45,840
dropping things

58
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:49,280
luckily there was nothing in there

59
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,280
my little lens cap

60
00:03:51,539 --> 00:03:55,919
oh and there's my Dabber too very nice

61
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,080
very nice

62
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:59,458
very good very good very good I'm not

63
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,900
sure where we're upside down right now

64
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:04,560
but nope

65
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:07,260
okay so we're gonna take that too

66
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,500
do this up

67
00:04:07,259 --> 00:04:10,979
that on there like that

68
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:13,438
[Music]

69
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:16,199
and I think

70
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:19,019
will be a way to the races

71
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:20,639
a little crooked it's okay

72
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:22,199
do our best that we can we're just gonna

73
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,639
take a quick dab here because what a

74
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:26,100
beautiful place and if I didn't take a

75
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:28,259
dab I would be remiss

76
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:31,820
I have some of my tops here right now

77
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:31,819
we're gonna hit 47.

78
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,418
I believe this was skittles it could be

79
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:39,560
wrong I think it was one of the top

80
00:04:36,418 --> 00:04:39,560
three though that placed

81
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:45,600
and we'll be hitting out of the Legends

82
00:04:42,019 --> 00:04:48,180
Carter 2. so we'll hit this up one two

83
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,160
three four five on the top button

84
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:53,180
she turns on

85
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,180
her little visual

86
00:04:53,339 --> 00:04:58,500
um all right still got 60 which is great

87
00:04:56,699 --> 00:05:00,540
I only had 20 percent when I woke up

88
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:04,500
this morning I was kind of lazy

89
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:06,360
last night I spaced putting it together

90
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,220
oh yeah I'm gonna take a big one of this

91
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,540
you know what I'm gonna finish it that's

92
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:11,699
what we gotta do

93
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:13,560
we gotta finish these dabs so that's

94
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:16,639
another one finished

95
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,639
down the tubes

96
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:22,199
push the top button again twice once

97
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:24,239
you've turned it on and that ignites the

98
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:26,340
uh the the temperature I don't know if

99
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,319
you can really see the screen

100
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:30,599
but it basically shows you it climbing

101
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:32,879
in speed in temperature

102
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,900
and then once it reaches temperature it

103
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:37,699
basically

104
00:05:33,899 --> 00:05:37,698
um turns on a timer for you

105
00:05:38,459 --> 00:05:41,060
here we go

106
00:05:51,478 --> 00:05:54,319
so tasty

107
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,180
and I have not been putting water in

108
00:05:58,978 --> 00:06:02,099
mine

109
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:04,319
for the most part because it's going in

110
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:07,220
and out of my bag very quickly but the

111
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,219
water just becomes a pain

112
00:06:12,149 --> 00:06:18,978
[Laughter]

113
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:18,978
not bad

114
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:28,919
so many of the rosins of uh masters of

115
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:31,799
rosin's entries were absolute fire

116
00:06:28,918 --> 00:06:34,159
um I want to get my Q-tips out and do a

117
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,160
little bit of

118
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:39,000
washing

119
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:40,560
cleaning

120
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,300
gooping

121
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,939
actually pulled them out actually the

122
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:47,520
other pack oh yeah they're right next to

123
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:49,319
me I kind of figured I did but you know

124
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:51,180
what

125
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:53,300
sometimes it's easy to forget these

126
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,300
things

127
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:57,500
okay

128
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,339
it's good to clean this

129
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:04,139
as soon as you're done it's a very good

130
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:06,239
rosin pipe too I put a little bit of

131
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:08,639
melt in and there was some residuals

132
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,500
whoa we're shaking now aren't we

133
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,660
a little bit of residuals but otherwise

134
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:14,399
really good

135
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:16,199
and that's about how quick and easy you

136
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:18,719
can hit the Magna Carta I like the wind

137
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:20,780
effect actually I'm going to leave that

138
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,580
because it's a trip there shut her down

139
00:07:20,779 --> 00:07:26,159
I had a nice dab I'm gonna go find my

140
00:07:23,579 --> 00:07:28,198

Mountain Highway I wish I could have

155

shown it to you guys on the GoPro but I

156
