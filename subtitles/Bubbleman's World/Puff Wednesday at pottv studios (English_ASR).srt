7
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,760
We're going to be sublimating and

right. So, I kind of forgot I had to go

16
00:02:55,039 --> 00:03:00,519

23
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,280
can check out the sign

24
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:31,439

25
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,519
a ring a doorbell thing. But we are at

26

little bit video for Bubble Man's World.

32
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,598
Awesome. So, that is Squish, one of our

33
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:51,598
uh employees that has come back to join

34
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:53,839

35
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:56,000
it up with the Burning Man crew, which

36
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,280
is always good. True. Can't go wrong.

37
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
So, yeah, we're just going to take these

38
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:03,039
guys for a little tour through the shop.

39
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,039
Check out some hoodlm

40
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:09,680
stuff. Oo, some screens.

41
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:12,680
Large dry scripts of screen is

42
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,680
excellent.

43
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:49,680
How's it going, Stu?

44
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,280
This is our hard at work, Stew. He's

45
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,720
been our shipping agent for oh, over 10

46
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:56,319
years. Now moved into the position of

47
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,320

Get the He's the jack of all trades.

49
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:03,199
He's the jack of all trades. If you

50
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:05,680
bought bubble bags, most likely Stu has

51
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:08,000
packaged them and mailed them to you.

52
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,160
So, very cool. You got an order coming

53
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,399
out here. Is Matt's order around? Yeah,

54
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,720
it's just at the back. Oh, great. So,

55
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:17,279
all ready to go. Excellent. Wow. The

56
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,800
hoodlams are looking scarce. Yeah.

57
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:21,439
Excellent. That means they're all in

58
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:24,478
stores where they belong. And this is

59
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:26,639

00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:35,519
Great. Well, I'm going to take these

65
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:37,038
guys for a little tour into my office,

66
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:39,159
show them a little of my old glass, and

67
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:41,599
then head down to Paw TV and do some

68
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:44,039
filming. All right, so here's my little

69
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:47,759
office. I never come in here,

70
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:49,439
but nonetheless, here it is. People of

71
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,680
Bubble Man's World, people that are

72
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:56,120
watching out there, um this is some of

73
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,120
my glass collection from over the years.

74
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,519
you know, something

75
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:02,840
like

76
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:06,560
Marcel

77
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:09,359
1999. Uh, number one of three. This

78
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:14,800
piece was about just under $5,000 back

79
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,800
in 1999. Very, very fun little

80
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,840
piece.

81
00:06:17,478 --> 00:06:22,639
Yeah. So, hopefully we'll be doing a

82
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:25,679
show with Flav in the near future where

83
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:28,400
we hit some of these wonderful pipes.

84
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,360
This one I won first place at the

85
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:32,959
Toker's bowl years ago, 2003 or four.

86
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,000
And it was, this was a double bubbler

87
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:39,239
blown by Slinger. Some old school. He's

88
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,000
got a uranium marble in there. Just

89
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:44,319
really kind of old school fun glass.

90
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,038
Glass you don't see every day. So

91
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,560
hopefully I'll be able to uh go through

92
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:50,079
some of that and show it to you next

93
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,759
time I'm here. Here's a really cool

94
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:54,560
Gates and piece. I'm not sure how many

95
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:57,120
Gates and Reco made of these pieces, but

96
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,598
two huge marbles with this little spoon

97
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:03,720
in the middle. It's

98
00:06:58,598 --> 00:07:07,199
just really, really a cool piece. Heavy,

99
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:11,520
too. Uh, how about this one? The Jason

100
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:13,680
Lee water encased bubble man chillum.

101
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:15,918
Yeah, Jason did that back for me. Oh

102
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:19,120
god, I don't even know. Must have been

103
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:20,879
in 2000 or something. Water encased on

104
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:24,519
the top. So when you put anything in, it

105
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:27,199
magnifies around the water.

106
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:30,000
Yeah. Anyway, just wanted to show you a

107
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:32,240
few of those. I'm going to head down to

108
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,759
Pot TV and meet with Matt as well as

109
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,680

00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:10,958
over the influence but constantly under.

with

133
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:29,759
Excellent. Excellent.

134
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,399
All right, Al, you're in my show today.

135
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:33,838

time to uh you know, Puff Joints and

144
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,360

00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:55,600
B is on his way as well with a bunch of

146
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,159
different flavors and a sublimator. Do

147
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,278
you have a suppleator? I do. Well, we

148
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:00,958
should get it plugged in cuz that's

149
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:04,639
really the only way I can enjoy the

150
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:06,719
herb. Ah, yeah. In the meantime, we'll

151

this a sweet skunk or island? No, that's

165
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,360
the that's the original. So here's

166
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:43,519
here's the sweet skunk not cleaned.

167
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,120
Okay. And then and then that one it's a

168
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:48,639
little bit lighter. You can start seeing

169
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,320
it. That one's fresh frozen. Wow. Mhm.

170
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:52,399
But it's really gunk. You can really

171
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,079
notice it on the bouquet. This one has

172
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,839
really notice it on the clean. This one

173
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:59,519
has like an adhesive smell to it. Smell

174
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:02,079
these two. Smell this one. This is

175
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:05,440
cleaned. Smell it deep and then smell

176
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:09,278
this one and see which one you find has

177
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:12,240
that more. What we got here?

178
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:13,919
I get the perfy. That's a fresh frozen

179
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,399
though. I think I put it in too early

180
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:17,919
cuz it's all gummed up. It's been drying

181
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,240
for two about two days. This one's

182
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:22,639
brighter. Looks lovely. Yeah, it's it's

183
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,680
it's more intense, isn't it? It stays

184
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:28,439
longer. I don't It's It's This one has

185
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:31,199
something deeper in it. There's like a

186
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:32,640
woody a woody spiciness to this one.

187
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,640
Probably more plant matter. Oh, for

188
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:36,799
sure. Let me take a little of this one

189
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:38,559
here. Oh, I like that. Which one is

190
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:41,278
that? This is the It's We call it the

191
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:44,479
JT15. It's a fish variety of some sort,

192
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:46,000
but I I just think I It's about 2 days.

193
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,920
Is that dry sifted as well? No, that's

194
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:53,120
fresh frozen. That looks wet wash.

195
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:53,120
Beautiful oil. Gorgeous. I love the way

196
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:57,120
it should let it dry a little bit

197
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,880
though. I think no matter what if you

198
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,278
let it keep letting it dry that it it'll

199
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:04,000
still sort of come up like that. You dry

200
00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:05,120
it to a degree just just the warmth too.

201
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,039
You know what I just talked about this

202
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,959
recently about getting the moisture out

203
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:11,199
which is why it's so important to to

204
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:13,759
wick the moisture out and then it allows

205
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:16,879
you to actually cure the hash which is

206
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:18,319
basically dehydrating the wax membrane.

207
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:19,439
You know the wax membrane is thicker

208
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,120
when it's got that little bit of

209
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,600
moisture. If you've seen the photographs

210
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,679
of the live dry homes, they just look so

211
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,440
good. And it's crazy that I haven't shot

212
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:29,120
as much dry nug because it doesn't look

213
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,720
as good, but I'm going to get into it

214
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,120
because those heads, they look like

215
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,040
raisins, you know? They just dry right

216
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,360
out. That that the heads get a lot of

217
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:39,039
ridges in them and they that stuff. And

218
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,680
I really learned this from guys like Sam

219
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:45,559
and Rob. It becomes infinitely smoother

220
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:47,759
to smoke on. Yeah. When you cure

221
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:50,958
it, you might lose a little bit of the

222
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:54,639
turppen in in the in the long run just

223
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:57,799
through sort of natural uh volatility of

224
00:12:54,639 --> 00:13:01,039
the turppines. But that

225
00:12:57,799 --> 00:13:02,639
smoothness nemesis. Wow, that nemesis is

226
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:05,199
nice. Look at the sparkle it leaves on

227
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:08,159
the table. So airy and and fluffy, but

228
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,879
look at that. Dank.

229
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:12,879
Really nice. That was nice island sweet

230
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:15,360
skunk as well. No, just regular sweet

231
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:17,120
scum. Oh, sweet scum. Yeah, just from

232
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,759
everyone's always just from holding and

233
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:23,440
passing those nugs. I prefer regular to

234
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:25,120
be honest. That's sticky. Um, which one

235
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,560
was the one you the wet wash that you

236
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:30,320
pulled and stretched? Uh, that was this

237
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:32,879
one here. All right, let's see that

238
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:35,200
little guy.

239
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:38,399
It's a cush of some sort. Oh, yeah. Very

240
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:40,959
melty, that's for sure.

241
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,480
to uh try and get some macro shots for

242
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:44,638
those of you guys watching at home right

243
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,839
now.

244
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:51,159
Don't really uh

245
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:51,160
see it otherwise.

246
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,440
Good job.

247
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:57,679
Yeah, they're fresh frozen. I'm sort of

248
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,160
digging it.

249
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:02,799
That's good stuff, man.

250
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:05,360
Have you ever ripe live off the plant

251
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:08,479
into a buck and vice?

252
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:11,519
No. I have. Try that. It's fun. Yeah,

253
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,759
it's really fun. I have some stuff that

254
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,360
in the summertime it was like it was

255
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:18,000
snapping. There was like pieces of

256
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,000
shatter falling off it and then when it

257
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,839
got really hot and humid, it changed

258
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,240
consistency and since then it's been the

259
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:26,560
same. It's like this oil slick. It's the

260
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,879
weirdest. Yeah, it's really good. I got

261
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:30,559
some in my bag. Yeah, I have some oily

262
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:32,639
uh water hash that's about to 5 years

263
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:34,799
old now. And it's just over time has

264
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:37,360
completely it's like the the wax

265
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:39,439
membranes have like just disintegrated

266
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,519
and it's just this I have it out on an

267
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,000
oil slick and people constantly like

268
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:46,480
you're hitting oil like no no it's just

269
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,559
some water extracted.

270
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:51,519
Yeah it's interesting that's all the

271
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:53,359
time. No concentrate is that no

272
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,120
concentrate some dry sip. Just some dry

273
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,360
sip. You know it really is interesting

274
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,919
to see the reemergence of dry sip coming

275
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:03,199
back around though. Yeah, California

276
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:05,519
guys. Yeah. And people just and those

277
00:15:03,198 --> 00:15:08,000
boys, they're they're Yeah. Well, I

278
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,440
think Nik's doing a lot of solventless

279
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,198
water extraction. I'm not sure if he's

280
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:15,040
played around with uh with um dry sift

281
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:17,679
yet. I I gave him a bubble box, not this

282
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:18,958
year at the cup, but last year. And I' I

283
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:20,799
haven't seen him post any pictures yet,

284
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:22,719
but I'm waiting. It's not a big amount

285
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:25,919
of screen to play with, but he's got the

286
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,759
fire. So, you got to think that um that

287
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:29,198
he'll produce some in the near future.

288
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:31,360
calling you out, Nick. We want to see

289
00:15:29,198 --> 00:15:33,919
your dry sift. Make some dry sift for

290
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,959
us. If it's anything like your hash, uh

291
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:38,759
I think we'll be

292
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:41,759
pleasantly pleasantly happy with your

293
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:43,360
results. All right. So, this one is

294
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:46,720
watermelon. Uh this one is not

295
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:50,879
watermelon. This one is um

296
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:52,800
um Bubba and OG. Not like together like

297
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:54,159
across, but just two separate mixed

298
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:56,559
together. Yeah. And and then mixed

299
00:15:54,159 --> 00:16:00,480
together.

300
00:15:56,559 --> 00:16:03,758
Drop that in there. Melt up here. I need

301
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:05,600
to give it a little push.

302
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:11,959
Yeah, sure. Oh, we got things coming at

303
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:11,959
us from all angles. Oh, that was crazy.

304
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:19,360
What do we got here? I don't know. Jeez.

305
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:21,120
Who's packing the uh 20 hits of this

306
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,360
bubble? Is this like a single shot or am

307
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,519
I passing this around? Okay, it's a

308
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,919
single shot. Why the I'm the kind of guy

309
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:30,639
King Kong. The rule is the rule. It's a

310
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:32,078
big Samson dab.

311
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,919
Can you pull that out or anything? Uh,

312
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:37,319
no. Just Yeah, just kind of leave it

313
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:41,360
like that. Do a little

314
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:43,600
uh carbon. It was a huge hit. So, don't

315
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,440
feel that letting it go is a bad thing.

316
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,360
That's for sure.

317
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,680
I'm about to take a hint and join these

318
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,680
guys in Coughville.

319
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:55,239
Wow. Is that

320
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:09,360
Oh, wow. That reminded me of being at

321
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:11,679
S's place. I swear to God.

322
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:14,879
That really reminded me of being at S's

323
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:19,000
place, I think, because S that was at JT

324
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:22,959
also just loves to

325
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:25,199
pack huge bowls. And so I have to admit

326
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:27,839
I do appreciate a hit like that because

327
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:33,440
I mean I got mostly like a tarpine hit

328
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:37,359
but a huge crazy smoky tarpine hit.

329
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:39,440
We thank our uh unknown donor and

330
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:41,678
marijuana man as well who's just uh

331
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,600
sitting off camera puffing as tough as

332
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:45,080
he poss

333
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:47,279
to the unknown

334
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:49,599
donor. I didn't even realize there was

335
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:52,720
water in that pipe.

336
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:55,519
Not too much. But like enough that it's

337
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,600
covering all the purse. Oh, I love the

338
00:17:55,519 --> 00:18:00,160
smell of that.

339
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:02,879
Amazing. Absolutely.

340
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,880
Need a little

341
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:08,558
bit last night. It was interesting, too,

342
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:10,720
cuz I was sitting with the scope. Yep.

343
00:18:08,558 --> 00:18:12,720
Exactly. Hey, look at that. Brought my

344
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,720
little scope. Sell these at fresh

345
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:17,519
headies. They even got the little black

346
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:21,919
light for seeing if uh counterfeit

347
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:24,759
money. There's a I got one, too.

348
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:30,720
Oh yeah, crystally.

349
00:18:24,759 --> 00:18:30,720
Yeah, we're looking at a good solid 70

350
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:37,840
plus 80 back.

351
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,279
Oh, I love I wish I could share this.

352
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:41,678
Actually, I'm going to I'm going to get

353
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:43,119
my macro macros and and cuz you have to

354
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,880
see it. We can't just talk about it.

355
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:46,879
That would be absolutely annoying,

356
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:50,240
right? And of course, we have to hit it

357
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:52,880
as well cuz this is the Let's Get

358
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:55,200
as stoned as we can episode. We're at

359
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,200
the Paw TV studios.

360
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,600
Look, there's a We got Mark Emory

361
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:02,200
representing. Nice blanket of smoke.

362
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:05,119
Dude, that looks killer. Hovering just

363
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:06,640
above 3 ft or 2 and 1/2 ft above the

364
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:09,839
ground. That does look very nice,

365
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:13,400
doesn't it? Yeah. All right, here we go.

366
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:13,399
Which one is this? Another

367
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:21,839
That's the number one. That's pretty

368
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,759
much the number one seed that we sell.

369
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:26,159
It's the afghani from the house of the

370
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:28,879
great gardener. I think there's another

371
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:34,360
head.

372
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:34,360
Number one for pain at the club

373
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,038
of what we have anyway. Yeah, that's

374
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:41,519
nice. I love Afghanany. I love the

375
00:19:39,038 --> 00:19:44,240
taste. I love the strength, potency.

376
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:46,400
What uh where these genetics were

377
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,558
collected or grown like how were these

378
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:52,160
these genius genetics were a sort of

379
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:53,599
collection of the best trains and

380
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,960
combashion clubs all the way across

381
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:59,359
Canada. Nice. Uh that's a great source.

382
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:01,519
Well, we well we just got to the a lot

383
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:03,038
of the clubs together and we were you

384
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:04,720
said you know what's what works good for

385
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:06,558
you. This is what's good for us. We're

386
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,000
willing to trade. Let's trade. You guys

387
00:20:06,558 --> 00:20:10,000
can have these ones. We can have these

388
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,759
ones. So open up the gene pool. Yeah.

389
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,759
You know, like we got the Jean Ge out of

390
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:18,640
Montreal and you know, and the Homa

391
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:21,038
strain, which is here, that strain was

392
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:23,038
phenotype selected by the members of the

393
00:20:21,038 --> 00:20:24,798
club, you know, which one do you guys

394
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:26,640
like the best? We sort of we narrowed it

395
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:28,400
down to Yeah. the three top phenotypes

396
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,000
and then we put it to the members and

397
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,679
and then they tell us which one they

398
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,159
like. To me, that's kind of the ultimate

399
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:36,080
cup. You know, it's reminiscent of Shiva

400
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:37,919
Rachie in Nepal each year, which is

401
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:39,519
Shiva's birthday, and it lasts for

402
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,280
months. But you know they'll have these

403
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:43,918
gatherings lots of the sadus and the

404
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:46,399
babas the shivite babas show up and of

405
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:49,038
course these guys puff extremely tough

406
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:51,120
uh chillums and grams of hash in a puff

407
00:20:49,038 --> 00:20:54,319
type of thing and they just put out

408
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:58,319
their hash on little plates right and

409
00:20:54,319 --> 00:21:00,798
whoseever hash is gone first

410
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:03,279
right that's it there's no trophy

411
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:06,639
there's no like posting it on Facebook

412
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:08,480
there's just your hash got smoked first

413
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,559
and that says everything. Everybody

414
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,079
knows nothing else needs to be said.

415
00:21:10,558 --> 00:21:13,759
What a beautiful thing. So that was the

416
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:15,918
way it was in Australia, too. The

417
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:18,599
winners of the cup, the plates were

418
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:21,038
empty. Exactly. Right. That was

419
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:22,959
nim two years in a row. That's I

420
00:21:21,038 --> 00:21:25,119
remember Barge's photos cuz he went with

421
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:29,440
you that year, did you not? Yeah. Yeah,

422
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:31,599
that was great. Good. Uh good historical

423
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:35,120
barge. Yeah, absolutely. I'll take a hit

424
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:37,839
to to Barge aka the Tricom farmer. good

425
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:41,639
friend of ours, cannabis photographer

426
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:44,079
here for years. Um, he moved off to

427
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:45,080
Switzerland and lo and behold, he never

428
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:47,918
came

429
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:50,079
back. So, we miss him. I think about

430
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:52,080
him. I used to see him every once in a

431
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:53,918
while at shows in Europe. I'd go do a

432
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:56,960
show in Switzerland or go do a show in

433
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:58,799
Germany. And he was right there. He'd

434
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,519
show up with chocolate. He'd show up

435
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:03,519
with chocolate and, you know, be ready

436
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:04,720
to work the bubble. Truly a bubble

437
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:06,759
ambassador.

438
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:09,440
Tricom farmer was a bubble

439
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:12,158
ambassador. It's true. Of the of the of

440
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,840
the highest caliber. I thought I dropped

441
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:16,080
it, but I did not. I didn't really know

442
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:19,038
Barge, but I met him once. Okay. And it

443
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:22,240
was at Amsterdam at S's place. At his

444
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:24,720
old place, and we were hanging out at

445
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,720
his old place when he had the It was

446
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,360
like two tier.

447
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:31,440
Oh, yeah. It was Maybe it was above the

448
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:34,719
above I don't I don't think it was above

449
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:36,240
the uh hardware store. He

450
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,159
used to used to go up the stairs and

451
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,599
then there was a fluff with the flat and

452
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:41,360
then you'd go up the stairs and his

453
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:44,399
apartment still his apartment is there.

454
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:45,759
No, no, he's in he's in a new place

455
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,120
because he used to be able to go down to

456
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:49,519
the second floor and you would open up

457
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:50,959
the whole wall and then you'd go in. Oh,

458
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:52,400
vaguely. I mean, I've known someone for

459
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:56,960
a long time, but that must be going back

460
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:58,320
a long goes back to like 98 or 99. I

461
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,600
would have definitely been there then,

462
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:01,918
too. I might have even been there when

463
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:03,599
you met Barge,

464
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:05,520
depending on what year that was. It

465
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:07,678
would have been me. It would have been I

466
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:11,319
usually had a booth. Yeah, Kyle Kushman

467
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:14,000
and those guys were lecturing that year.

468
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:15,599
Uh there were a lot of guys back then.

469
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,440
The good old Cannabis Cup. I got

470
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:19,038
millions of Cannabis Cup stories, let me

471
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,679
tell you.

472
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:23,919
Going since 1995. We had a good time

473
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:25,679
this year. [ __ ] a good year. I don't

474
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:27,200
have anything to compare to, but it was

475
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,440
uh it was fun. Well, I can tell you I've

476
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,440
been like 17 or 18 times and it was

477
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,360
really fun. It was really good. It was a

478
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,679
good group of people. I mean, I think

479
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:38,639
the cup is what you make it, you know.

480
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:40,720
It's really kind of like if you are in

481
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,960
with I mean, you got treated like gold

482
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:45,120
by Arian in the greenhouse. That's

483
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,038
that's very unique. You know, if you can

484
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:49,038
have that experience, that's great. You

485
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:50,558
know, when when I used to hang out with

486
00:23:49,038 --> 00:23:53,359
breeder Steve back in the day in

487
00:23:50,558 --> 00:23:54,798
Amsterdam, Arian also loved Steve and

488
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:57,439
always treated him with the utmost

489
00:23:54,798 --> 00:24:00,639
respect and just the few times I got in

490
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:02,960
with Steve to receive that, you know,

491
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,799
shine that he was doing. It was a good

492
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,279
feeling for certain, you know. I met

493
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:10,000
Neville and Howard Marx like up in his

494
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:11,519
apartment, you know, that was all all

495
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,440
people closed doors that you would just

496
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:14,639
never get behind back then. So, you

497
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,720
would have had what? The cannabis

498
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:19,038
castle. I just missed the cannabis

499
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:21,120
castle. That was in '95 that they shut

500
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:23,200
it down. Uh I think '96 it was shut

501
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:26,158
down, but '94 95 there were tours for

502
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,679
the cannabis castle and uh I remember my

503
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:29,120
friend's daughter was actually the girl

504
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,880
that worked on the bus and another

505
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:32,719
friend of mine recently just told me his

506
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,799
daughter also was working during those

507
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,880
years. So two of my friends, their

508
00:24:34,798 --> 00:24:38,798
daughters were running the sort of tours

509
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,440
back and forth to the cannabis castle.

510
00:24:38,798 --> 00:24:42,960
So yeah, that was an amazing place. If

511
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,200
if you got lucky enough to go to

512
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:47,600
Canada's castle, you know, in '94 or

513
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:50,240
'95, it was a very unique place just

514
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:52,558
outside of Amsterdam that uh a lot of

515
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,640
magic happened in the Oh my goodness.

516
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:56,079
Yeah. All sorts of incredible breeding,

517
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,720
all sorts of incredible cannabis

518
00:24:56,079 --> 00:25:01,678
strains. So, came out of that place. It

519
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:04,079
was definitely one of my, you know, not

520
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:06,240
quite my favorite place I've ever got to

521
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:08,960
visit in Holland, but it's up there in

522
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,640
the top three for sure.

523
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,159
There's uh a lot of things have happened

524
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,919
in Holland in regards to breeding

525
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:16,159
cannabis. I think that people forget

526
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:17,759
sometimes. It's easy to go to Amsterdam

527
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:19,760
and buy shitty weed at a coffee shop and

528
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:21,119
be like, "This place sucks." I think

529
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:23,119
people have the same experience. They

530
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:25,119
come to Vancouver, potentially try to

531
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:27,038
buy weed off a sketch bag on the street,

532
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:28,719
get robbed, get robbed, or lose their

533
00:25:27,038 --> 00:25:30,480
money in the least. And then they don't

534
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,400
like Vancouver or they or even worse,

535
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:35,120
they get shitty weed and then tell

536
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:37,679
everyone Vancouver has shitty weed. It's

537
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:40,319
like it's your ability to find good weed

538
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:42,320
that's at stake here, not Vancouver's

539
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:43,839
ability to produce good weed. You get

540
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:45,599
good weed anywhere. Anywhere. You just

541
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:47,199
got to be able to find that person. I

542
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:48,558
found the same thing even about

543
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,960
anywhere. Awesome hash. It doesn't

544
00:25:48,558 --> 00:25:52,200
matter where you go. That's it. You

545
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,960
know, with

546
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:56,480
computer website rooms and chats now,

547
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,038
you know, like-minded people finding

548
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,360
each other. I started a site on uh

549
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:03,919
Facebook called Team Drysift just a

550
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:05,918
couple months ago. Team Dryift. Team dry

551
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:08,320
sift. Oh, team dry setift. Team dry.

552
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:12,320
Yeah, team. And I said team dry.

553
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:15,759
Definitely not team dry. Team team. A

554
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:17,278
group of people together functioning as

555
00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:19,440
So yeah, it's been good. There's like

556
00:26:17,278 --> 00:26:22,480
300 members in there. There's there's

557
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:25,038
people producing 99% gland head hash in

558
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,960
there. Go in there, see the pictures.

559
00:26:25,038 --> 00:26:28,720
It's Yeah, it's good. It's People need

560
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:31,679
to know that this isn't something that,

561
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:34,000
you know, only the few can do. It's

562
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:35,759
something that only the few choose to

563
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,919
do.

564
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:41,200
Put a screen under the under your drying

565
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:43,679
cannabis. Trim your dry dry cannabis

566
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:47,200
onto a screen. Just let it bounce onto a

567
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:50,640
screen. Put your dry your drying your

568
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:53,840
drying rack should be made of of screen.

569
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:55,679
And every time you flip your shake,

570
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:59,759
you'll be you'll be amazed at the

571
00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:02,000
quality of the dry sift you get as the

572
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:04,558
shake dries. Yeah, it'll change. Oh,

573
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,319
absolutely. Right. And it and it'll be

574
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:08,079
And that's all you do is just flip your

575
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:09,639
shake. Flip your shake. Cut your buds

576
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:12,798
up. Yeah. You can get some

577
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:15,440
incredibly good quality hash doing just

578
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:17,839
that. Totally. Even without cleaning.

579
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,400
Like depending on how gentle you are,

580
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:22,879
you can get some amazing I tell people

581
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:25,120
this is falling off your plants anyway.

582
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,960
Just because you're not collecting it

583
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:28,158
doesn't mean off the drying line. Take

584
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,840
it off the drying line to get that

585
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:29,840
little snap. Sh. They're like, "Won't

586
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:29,918
Won't Won't Won't Won't Won't Won't

587
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:29,918
Won't Won't Won't Won't Won't Won't

588
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:31,679
Won't Won't Won't Won't Won't Won't

589
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:33,360
Won't Won't that lower the quality?

590
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:35,519
We're not telling you to bounce all your

591
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:37,918
buds. We're telling you to You got to

592
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:39,519
cut it off the stock anyway.

593
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:42,720
You're cutting it off into a into a

594
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:45,119
plastic dish or a bowl or just have a

595
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,120
screen and cut it off. Let it bounce on

596
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:49,359
the screen and that's it. You don't Al's

597
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:51,278
making hash. Don't bounce it again. You

598
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:53,599
don't even need a screen while you do.

599
00:27:51,278 --> 00:27:55,200
Let's not say that. But truly, just

600
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:56,719
throw any even like a piece of glass

601
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,319
under there and you'll see what you're

602
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,079
losing.

603
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:01,839
It's uh it's definitely And for the

604
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:04,319
screen size for those of you that might

605
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:06,319
not know the proper size, you know, what

606
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:09,918
would you say anywhere between a 140 and

607
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:11,918
a I would say like a 140 to a 155. Some

608
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:14,080
people like to go big. A lot of people

609
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:15,840
online are talking. I use the lines per

610
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:17,519
inch more just cuz you get the stain.

611
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:19,918
You get the stainless steel. I use lines

612
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:21,599
per inch as well. It's silk as well.

613
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,799
Lines per inch. I just talk micron

614
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:24,558
because when I talk lines per most

615
00:28:22,798 --> 00:28:27,278
people understand micron. Well, because

616
00:28:24,558 --> 00:28:29,599
200 lines per inch is like 70 micron.

617
00:28:27,278 --> 00:28:32,880
And people are like, "What?" So, you put

618
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:35,199
the 200 on the bottom. Uh, yeah. The 100

619
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,720
goes on the top or 110, I guess, would

620
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,360
be around what you would want. Those are

621
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:42,159
what I sell on my site. And the 200 I

622
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:44,479
used to sell a 300, which is like a 45.

623
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:46,399
It's too tight. I got a 325. It's very

624
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:49,519
hard to clean on. It's like It's like

625
00:28:46,398 --> 00:28:53,359
It's like It's extremely tight mesh

626
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:55,359
cloth. Yeah. Yeah. It's like uh the 70 I

627
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:57,599
like for people to learn on and see

628
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:59,759
results. Yeah. And then if you want to

629
00:28:57,599 --> 00:29:02,480
play with the 50, that is patient man's

630
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:05,119
work. And hopefully you have a cold

631
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,798
environment cuz trying to break any type

632
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:09,759
of contaminant through those little

633
00:29:06,798 --> 00:29:12,158
holes is a [ __ ] Yeah. Who needs a

634
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:13,919
bonnet? We haven't been puffing enough.

635
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:16,760
I'll take one. Well, I did put it right

636
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:20,720
in front of you. All

637
00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:22,158
right. Loving all the hash.

638
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:26,798
I look at it all on the inside of my

639
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:29,760
medain. Oh, yes. Medainer John missing

640
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:32,079
Puff Wednesdays. Can you believe it? He

641
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:33,759
was uh supposed to be on his way here

642
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:35,519
with his sublimator and all his flavors.

643
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:38,240
We might still get uh a little bit of

644
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:40,480
that happening. Hold on, John. He's

645
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:43,679
busy. He's running around doing the good

646
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:47,200
work. Yeah, he is. He's always hustling.

647
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:49,519
All right, there you go. You want to dab

648
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:52,159
yourself?

649
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:52,158
Dab it

650
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:57,119
up. Well, I've never filmed an episode

651
00:29:55,278 --> 00:29:58,960
down here at Pot TV. I mean, I've gone

652
00:29:57,119 --> 00:30:00,558
on my friends shows, but I've never

653
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:03,679
actually come and filmed Bubble Man's

654
00:30:00,558 --> 00:30:05,359
World down here. It's pretty cool.

655
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:08,000
I've never been on a Bubble Man show.

656
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:10,079
Also, who I've known for 25 years, knows

657
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,839
Ron really, really well. So, I know a

658
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:13,199
lot of you guys were big fans of Ron.

659
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:14,959
Did you get any footage of Ron while you

660
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,880
were done? Tons of footage. It's all on

661
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,480
on YouTube. That's why I'm telling you,

662
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,559
like people are like, "Ron's amazing.

663
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:24,960
Who is this guy? What an eccentric Ron

664
00:30:20,558 --> 00:30:27,440
is a [ __ ] icon and um a pioneer in

665
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:29,600
indoor gardening in Canada. Absolutely.

666
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:32,880
Like really like 100%. That guy was

667
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:35,359
growing indoors in the ' 70s. Yeah. You

668
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:37,039
know, even he said in the late '60s

669
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:38,639
talking about like 1,000 light bulbs

670
00:30:37,038 --> 00:30:40,480
that we're we're talking about, you

671
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,880
know, like

672
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:45,839
I think I think Ed Rosenthal talks about

673
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:47,520
they they didn't really figure out um

674
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:50,558
the flowering the flowering thing till

675
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:53,679
around 77 or 78 where we got guys like

676
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:56,398
Ron who was in [ __ ] Winnipeg in that

677
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:59,360
freezing cold,

678
00:30:56,398 --> 00:31:03,199
you know, growing under staircases and

679
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:06,000
flowering plants. Totally.

680
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:08,000
So really like it's pretty wild. And

681
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,440
he's still flowering plants. Yeah. Even

682
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,599
after serving 11 [ __ ] years in prison

683
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:16,159
in a in a federal penitentiary, too. Not

684
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:19,119
like the farm. Like in a hardcore

685
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:21,679
prison. As hardcore as it gets for

686
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:23,278
Canada anyway. It's good to see him out

687
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:25,038
and it's good to see him growing great

688
00:31:23,278 --> 00:31:27,759
pot.

689
00:31:25,038 --> 00:31:29,519
It really is cuz that's you know you

690
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:31,278
take that out of somebody's life who's

691
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:34,319
been doing it their whole life and it's

692
00:31:31,278 --> 00:31:38,079
it creates a void and that void creates

693
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:39,240
sadness creates all sorts of things. So

694
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:41,359
he was

695
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:43,759
definitely more bummed when he wasn't

696
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:45,759
allowed. Yeah. Like really not allowed.

697
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:49,038
Like just got out for the second time

698
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:51,440
and he's got to like seriously

699
00:31:49,038 --> 00:31:52,960
be good. But then he gets a license.

700
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:56,600
Awesome. That's what getting moving to

701
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,600
BC gets you.

702
00:31:58,798 --> 00:32:04,558
So, what do you got here? I was going to

703
00:32:01,278 --> 00:32:05,919
ask that same question.

704
00:32:04,558 --> 00:32:07,038
Oh, this this little thing or this

705
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:08,720
little thing? No, you're asking that

706
00:32:07,038 --> 00:32:11,359
thing. I want to know. Okay. Well, this

707
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:14,240
is the oil slick. This is oil slick is

708
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:17,839
the company. They do these uh uh

709
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:19,720
platinum grade silicone. Uh big in the

710
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:22,000
oil community because the oil doesn't

711
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:23,679
stick. You know, in the hash community

712
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,359
that I'm in, I like to stay on top of

713
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:28,000
things. And so, you know, when the guys

714
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:29,759
at Oil Slick, Lars actually, um, via the

715
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,038
guys at Oil Slick passed this on to me,

716
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:32,798
I started playing around with it. I

717
00:32:31,038 --> 00:32:34,720
melted some bubble onto it and I pressed

718
00:32:32,798 --> 00:32:37,519
some. It can be heated up and stuff. You

719
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:39,679
can cook cookies in the oven, too. Oh,

720
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:41,359
yeah. So, you could just like It's nice

721
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:42,640
to work on. Yeah. Yeah. You know what I

722
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:44,000
mean? It's a nice surface to work on.

723
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:46,559
I'm not sure. I need one of those for

724
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,919
myself. How well dry it would be. Maybe

725
00:32:46,558 --> 00:32:50,000
on the other side, which is a lot

726
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:52,559
smoother. Got one up on it. Yeah. It's a

727
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:56,480
little Well, not it's it's hard to say.

728
00:32:52,558 --> 00:32:59,440
And this one is the K9 tube. Who? Um I

729
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:01,120
guess Zion in Holland. I'm sorry. I

730
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,480
still have this Zion. I have to send

731
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:04,158
this back to you and I will send this

732
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:07,360
back to you this week. It just makes

733
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:10,240
such a great carb cap. And so I've been

734
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:12,479
using it to to carve. Yeah. It's a

735
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,200
little pipe that has a nail and a dome.

736
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:17,679
It's a little ring that goes around your

737
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:20,399
neck on a little uh pendant thing or

738
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:22,880
whatever. Seems tricky. Yeah, all these

739
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:24,959
fun little things. Little microscopes,

740
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,799
little containers, trippy sticks,

741
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:31,240
skillet tools. These are the tools we

742
00:33:26,798 --> 00:33:34,798
need to chain smoke cannabis

743
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:37,798
resin. So, ready for another rip there,

744
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:37,798
Matt?

745
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,679
Not sure what you're hitting or what

746
00:33:39,278 --> 00:33:43,079
you're feeling. Also, it's a little This

747
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:44,840
is kind of

748
00:33:43,079 --> 00:33:47,480
different.

749
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:53,278
Older, I

750
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:55,919
think. This is this is the last of this.

751
00:33:53,278 --> 00:33:58,398
This is a great little unit. I have to

752
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:00,320
say I do I have been enjoying fit that

753
00:33:58,398 --> 00:34:02,918
you can pretty much fit that on any sort

754
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:07,240
of head. Yeah, that particular nail is

755
00:34:02,919 --> 00:34:09,519
um is a 14. There you

756
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:10,800
go. And then you can use that as well if

757
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:13,599
you would like to carve it. You'll find

758
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:16,359
that it's a lot easier once you sort of

759
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:20,720
bring it down. Mr. John

760
00:34:16,358 --> 00:34:23,039
B in the house for Puff Wednesdays. Yes.

761
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:25,358
Puff Wednesday. All right. We're going

762
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:27,519
to sit down with John here in a minute.

763
00:34:25,358 --> 00:34:29,598
We'll be back.

764
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:31,759
All right. Welcome back. John has

765
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:32,960
finally made it to Puff Wednesdays. I

766
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,960
guess you had a little bit of drama

767
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,398
there. Small. It's okay. Excellent.

768
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:39,519
Well, you brought your sublimator and

769
00:34:36,398 --> 00:34:41,838
some flavors. Yes. And Matt Matt left

770
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:44,639
some some nice things as well here. So,

771
00:34:41,838 --> 00:34:48,078
I'm not really happy about that.

772
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:50,399
Al, can Al also left this ridiculous,

773
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:52,720
which I'm going to start it off with.

774
00:34:50,398 --> 00:34:55,440
Um, almost much like my 5-year cured

775
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:59,439
Master Kush.

776
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:59,440
I think I think just like oiled

777
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:04,400
out resin. Oh, I know. That's just what

778
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:07,519
I was trying. It's really It really

779
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:09,119
reminds me of that only. And honestly,

780
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:12,480
if I didn't have Bubble that was doing

781
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:15,160
this right now and I didn't know Al, I'd

782
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:18,039
be like, "What is

783
00:35:15,159 --> 00:35:20,719
this?" But you can still see it's got

784
00:35:18,039 --> 00:35:22,279
that hash thickness to it, even though

785
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:25,759
it is pretty much an

786
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:27,640
oil. All right. Do you clean this out a

787
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:32,720
little

788
00:35:27,639 --> 00:35:36,000
bit? Here we go. Thank you, Al.

789
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:38,159
Thanks, Al. No problem. Enjoy it. We're

790
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,159
in

791
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:53,199
John. Look, we're surely bubbling up the

792
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,199
clear

793
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:59,480
domes. That's nice.

794
00:35:56,559 --> 00:36:01,759
What do you got there? Some of

795
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:03,838
the just some herbs are in the bag. So

796
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:06,480
one and you can see all her just stuck

797
00:36:03,838 --> 00:36:08,078
to it right now. Doesn't have a name. We

798
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,240
just call it her. We call it number

799
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:14,480
three. Uh number three. Yeah. Number

800
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:16,319
three. It's not cushy.

801
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:19,519
What can I offer you a hit of John? I

802
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:21,599
would I would like to try um what's in

803
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:23,599
what? What's new? I haven't tried

804
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:25,280
something that's new that I haven't

805
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:26,800
tried. Well, why don't we go right to

806
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:29,200
what I just had? I haven't tried that,

807
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:31,440
but we'll try it again. It's worth

808
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:33,838
trying. Is that Oh, no. actually not. I

809
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:35,440
was looking at this for some reason.

810
00:36:33,838 --> 00:36:36,880
That one you definitely This is one of

811
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,920
my favorites. But we will hit that.

812
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:41,640
Well, we'll double you up. We'll give

813
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,639
you a small one of this

814
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:46,358
and we'll get you on that.

815
00:36:55,358 --> 00:37:02,078
Nice rib. Come on, John. You can do it.

816
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:02,078
peer

817
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:07,358
pressure. All right. So, what uh what's

818
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:10,480
John doing for the rest of the day after

819
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:11,920
uh after this? Oh, well, I'm going to

820
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,159
hang out here and I'm going to puff hard

821
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:16,320
with Greg and Al after this. Excellent.

822
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:18,239
They got their uh weekly uh under the

823
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,838
influence. Under the influence. And

824
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:21,039
because we're puffing on Wednesday at

825
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:22,400
your place most of the time, I don't get

826
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:24,719
a chance to come by and see these guys.

827
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,240
True enough. Since I'm here, of course,

828
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:27,519
I'm going to say it would make sense. It

829
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:30,000
would make sense. Plus, I want to puff

830
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:31,920
their herb anyways. Yes. Yes, got some

831
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,280
killing. There's no shortage of it. No

832
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,519
shortage. There's plenty of it to be

833
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:37,839
had.

834
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:41,320
So, I'm uh down to the nitty-g gritties

835
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:43,920
of me having to go do some

836
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:46,240
work. So, this was something here that I

837
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:48,320
recently just kind of did a quick, but

838
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:51,078
as you can see, it's going to be some I

839
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:54,559
mean, I think lots

840
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:56,320
of contaminant. Well, let's see. I

841
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:58,159
brought a little microscope today with

842
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,359
nuts. Yeah. Yeah, you know, just

843
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:00,319
something I just grabbed quickly and I

844
00:37:59,358 --> 00:38:02,159
thought, you know what, this is

845
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:04,960
something that uh definitely needs some

846
00:38:02,159 --> 00:38:06,399
work cuz I know it doesn't melt. Haven't

847
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:08,639
tried because I already know the work I

848
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,240
did with it was just minimal in there.

849
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:12,000
Just a little bit of contaminant like

850
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:14,078
you said, probably about maybe 30 or

851
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,880
40%. Yeah. Yeah, that's what I figured.

852
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:19,880
Lots of nice heads though. That was um

853
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:22,320
that there is my um

854
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:24,400
Ocross. When you get down and look at it

855
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:26,720
at that level and you see how small

856
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,559
these things are with the naked eye,

857
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:30,799
they seem to be bigger to me when I look

858
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:32,480
at them under my macro lens because

859
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,240
sometimes I have the back of my camera,

860
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:37,599
other times I do live view shooting with

861
00:38:34,239 --> 00:38:39,279
a monitor and so I can see it very big.

862
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:41,920
And this to look through this little

863
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:44,400
scope and to see how tiny these little

864
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:47,280
things are. if you want to check it out.

865
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:49,440
It's uh it's pretty incredible to think

866
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:51,960
of the work that it takes to get those

867
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:55,760
contaminants out separated from just the

868
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:58,960
heads. That's tricky work. No, it's uh

869
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:02,800
definitely not my next step. Yeah, but

870
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:05,079
something that you don't Absolutely.

871
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:08,240
Yeah. Generally at this level, it's just

872
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:09,680
around 60% won't quite melt. It might

873
00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:11,519
sizzle a little bit. Usually when you

874
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:13,199
get up to about 80 is when people think

875
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:15,440
they have full melt because it does

876
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:18,000
actually melt a bit. But it's really

877
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:21,920
into the 90s that you you see the real

878
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:24,880
like even this year. Um is it really a

879
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:27,280
phone? No. No. I got a little lazy

880
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:31,838
sometimes. Yeah. I get to the 90s and

881
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:33,920
I'm like I got to go. And is that 90? Um

882
00:39:31,838 --> 00:39:36,480
I'm comfortable.

883
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:39,680
We have this microscope. That's the joy

884
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:41,599
of that. So um how was your

885
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:44,559
Oh, it was really great. Had a great

886
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:46,720
time seeing uh seeing my friend Ron. I

887
00:39:44,559 --> 00:39:47,759
definitely watched the videos, but uh I

888
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:50,799
have a chance to sit down and say,

889
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:52,000
"Hey." Seeing Paul, seeing like Yeah, it

890
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,599
was just good, you know. How are the

891
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,599
guys from the Holy Smoke when I saw

892
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:59,039
those guys? And well, I ended up just

893
00:39:55,599 --> 00:40:02,320
seeing Paul. Um Holy Smokes is actually

894
00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:05,519
not around anymore. They closed a while

895
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:07,359
ago. I should say the the people,

896
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:10,320
but I got to see Paul and I got to see

897
00:40:07,358 --> 00:40:12,078
Dave, the the garden sage. It was nice.

898
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:14,400
He came over with the tumble now and we

899
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:16,240
did the little video and yeah, just all

900
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:18,720
all around fun. The cooties is a great

901
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:22,000
place to uh go see a bunch of cool

902
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:24,639
people and and 5:00 a.m. you sifting? Uh

903
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,719
3 3:00 a.m. Yeah. I can't remember the

904
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:28,239
time, but

905
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:30,159
yeah, it was 3:00 a.m. I was out in

906
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:33,439
Ron's backyard with the dry sip screens

907
00:40:30,159 --> 00:40:35,759
and the T5s. He had like 15 of them

908
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:37,599
lighting up the whole like back of his

909
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:40,960
yard. All the trees looked like daytime

910
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:42,800
back there. And it was pretty cold, too,

911
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,159
which is definitely helpful. Not only

912
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:47,519
when you're doing a single screen

913
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:49,838
extraction, but when you're um the fresh

914
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:52,639
frozen, the last of them. Oh, really?

915
00:40:49,838 --> 00:40:55,679
Yeah. I brought it over the platform.

916
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:57,519
Oh, the last fresh frozen.

917
00:40:55,679 --> 00:40:59,919
The last of John's fresh frozen. I only

918
00:40:57,519 --> 00:41:01,358
say ours cuz I narrated while he made

919
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:03,039
the whole batch and cleaned all the

920
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:07,679
bags.

921
00:41:03,039 --> 00:41:07,679
Hey, you know what? I found

922
00:41:07,719 --> 00:41:13,919
ours find when you get things down to uh

923
00:41:11,358 --> 00:41:16,358
really really pure and clean. Little

924
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:19,440
things like hair and dust and debris can

925
00:41:16,358 --> 00:41:21,519
really jump in and affect things easily.

926
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:24,559
Well, that's what's happening now to the

927
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:27,719
end of these being full and finding the

928
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:27,719
I keep.

929
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:42,079
Ah, yes. What's next then?

930
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:44,000
Nice and stuff here. How was this? Uh,

931
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:45,920
this is all from uh Matt. We were just

932
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:49,159
hitting this house of the great

933
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:52,639
gardener. So that was a little fresh

934
00:41:49,159 --> 00:41:55,279
frozen myoma. This one is his afghan.

935
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:57,559
That was I think dry set. I remember

936
00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:02,319
what this

937
00:41:57,559 --> 00:42:04,159
one was a nice piece. Oh, very nice.

938
00:42:02,318 --> 00:42:05,838
Smoked a lot of them, but now I've

939
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:07,519
smoked Oh, I haven't smoked yours yet.

940
00:42:05,838 --> 00:42:10,159
I'm about to do that. But I smoked Al's

941
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:12,679
and I smoked mine of three varieties and

942
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:14,719
I smoked like two or three varieties of

943
00:42:12,679 --> 00:42:16,239
Mats. So there's so many different

944
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:18,239
flavors at this point. I don't even know

945
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:19,919
what to try. But maybe this is the fresh

946
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:21,358
frozen you said. Yeah. Well, I should

947
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:24,240
probably hit this. This is some of the

948
00:42:21,358 --> 00:42:27,279
last hash that John and I made. Not on

949
00:42:24,239 --> 00:42:30,639
the boat. No. But in the back area when

950
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:34,000
we um we had that beautiful rose color

951
00:42:30,639 --> 00:42:37,000
water. Yes. Yeah. Exactly. Very nice.

952
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Okay.

953
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:43,280
So, I have been puffing on it like paper

954
00:42:40,159 --> 00:42:44,639
every day and uh that'll bring it out

955
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,680
and I figured I would definitely bring

956
00:42:44,639 --> 00:42:49,759
the last little bit of the

957
00:42:46,679 --> 00:42:52,480
120 because of course the '90s been gone

958
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:54,240
for probably 3 weeks.

959
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:56,719
Wa! Something just came in on the side.

960
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:58,959
Sublimate on the right. Wa! You had to

961
00:42:56,719 --> 00:43:01,039
step up. I'm going to guess Go out on a

962
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:03,119
limb and say this is Sublimate. Oh,

963
00:43:01,039 --> 00:43:05,358
yeah. from the sublimator that Al the

964
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:10,240
Alchemist just put on the It's very

965
00:43:05,358 --> 00:43:13,279
sick. Did he know? Oh my goodness.

966
00:43:10,239 --> 00:43:15,118
And so what sublimate is this from like

967
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:17,680
a hundred varieties of herb? All the

968
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:21,200
herb you smoke on a daily basis? Oh

969
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:23,519
yeah. Yeah. It's uh it tastes like just

970
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:25,679
killer flowers. Tastes like killer

971
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:28,000
flowers. You know, hard to say no to

972
00:43:25,679 --> 00:43:30,480
that. We'll let John step up to bat

973
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,679
first. He's always so nice. out. You

974
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,280
know that he's always like, "Well, let

975
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:37,078
John try this first." Well, you're the

976
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:37,079
guest on the show, dude.

977
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:41,200
Very rude. Like, I'm just going to sit

978
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:43,679
here and pop when I see Well, my guest

979
00:43:41,199 --> 00:43:46,480
sits there and is like, "Yeah." Hey, can

980
00:43:43,679 --> 00:43:47,639
I have the All right. Here you go. When

981
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:50,440
you're

982
00:43:47,639 --> 00:43:52,809
ready.

983
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:54,318
Sublimate. This is

984
00:43:52,809 --> 00:43:57,078
[Music]

985
00:43:54,318 --> 00:44:00,079
triple filter. Here we

986
00:43:57,079 --> 00:44:00,079
go.

987
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:05,960
Beautiful. Yeah. The sublimator is this

988
00:44:04,318 --> 00:44:09,719
little product right

989
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:12,079
here. Beautiful uh unreal beyond

990
00:44:09,719 --> 00:44:14,399
vaporizer which uh you've seen me use

991
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:17,680
before. You've seen John use before.

992
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:19,760
Enrio Bushard, who's the inventor, is a

993
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:22,000
real wild guy and an amazing character

994
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:23,920
that we we get to spend time with often

995
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,079
here in Vancouver when he visits and and

996
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:28,079
staying here. We spent time with him at

997
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:29,880
the cannabis cup this year and he's he's

998
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:33,400
come up with this, you

999
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:38,200
know, kind of unbelievable way of

1000
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:40,480
extracting using hot air, the resin from

1001
00:44:38,199 --> 00:44:43,279
cannabis. And it's not your everyday

1002
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:45,440
vaporizer. It's literally like what guys

1003
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,960
like me and Tricom Farmer and even even

1004
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,400
Skunk Man Sam have been saying for

1005
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,480
years. If we could only get like, you

1006
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:52,480
know, like 50 or 100 of those volcano

1007
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:54,480
bags all put into one bag, then that

1008
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:55,838
would be that would be a good product.

1009
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:58,639
And that's, you know, pretty much what

1010
00:44:55,838 --> 00:45:00,078
the uh what the sublimator is. And then,

1011
00:44:58,639 --> 00:45:02,719
of course, in the meantime, it makes

1012
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:06,560
this oil.

1013
00:45:02,719 --> 00:45:08,399
That is by far so medicinal. Like I just

1014
00:45:06,559 --> 00:45:10,880
I just kind of relax. While you're just

1015
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:12,880
hitting it, make hitting the sublimator,

1016
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,720
you're making oil. So, it's kind of like

1017
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:17,280
the sublimator is like a like bubble

1018
00:45:14,719 --> 00:45:20,159
bags. It's It's not really The real

1019
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:23,839
product is the thing you make. It puts

1020
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:25,920
the fun back in working. Yeah. I'm just

1021
00:45:23,838 --> 00:45:28,000
making resin, man. Still here. It's

1022
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:32,119
payback.

1023
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:34,559
It's payback. Here, have some grams of

1024
00:45:32,119 --> 00:45:37,559
resin. All right. Get a little

1025
00:45:34,559 --> 00:45:37,559
sublimate.

1026
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:54,079
Al's going to come rock something. the

1027
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:56,240
set. He's like, "Wait a second here. I'm

1028
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:58,079
invading the set." Oh, you know, he he

1029
00:45:56,239 --> 00:46:00,159
he puts his supplement on there and he

1030
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:01,920
goes, "Cuz I want to do it right. Why

1031
00:46:00,159 --> 00:46:04,000
don't you try this?" Cuz I need to get

1032
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:05,838
high right now. Oh, no. I'm I'm getting

1033
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:09,039
high over there. I smoked some really

1034
00:46:05,838 --> 00:46:10,318
nice batfish just now.

1035
00:46:09,039 --> 00:46:14,199
You're getting high over here, too. That

1036
00:46:10,318 --> 00:46:14,199
does taste beautiful.

1037
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:27,720
Boom. Perfect.

1038
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:30,639
Perfection. I was discussing this

1039
00:46:27,719 --> 00:46:34,239
uh little contraption that all of a

1040
00:46:30,639 --> 00:46:38,759
sudden just so nice. Take care. All

1041
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:41,118
right. Thanks. Flower

1042
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:43,280
supplate. Hot air extracted and

1043
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:46,240
basically recondensed in the stem.

1044
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:50,079
Pulled out and puffed. Not reclaimed. I

1045
00:46:46,239 --> 00:46:52,000
use the D nail. It produces reclaim in

1046
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:54,800
the stem here. It is not the same stuff

1047
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:57,358
at all. I find that the D nail and the

1048
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:58,880
sublimator are standalone products that

1049
00:46:57,358 --> 00:47:00,719
I don't even really compare. People ask

1050
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:02,880
me all the time which I which one I like

1051
00:47:00,719 --> 00:47:06,639
better and I find them different for

1052
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:08,720
different reasons. 100%. Yeah. 100%.

1053
00:47:06,639 --> 00:47:10,719
Yeah. No. Um that's one thing I've

1054
00:47:08,719 --> 00:47:12,399
learned with all even the volcano for me

1055
00:47:10,719 --> 00:47:14,159
hits me differently if I like to do an

1056
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:16,000
ice bag in the morning cuz I volcano at

1057
00:47:14,159 --> 00:47:18,159
home. Sure. I really like a nice little

1058
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,679
smooth little

1059
00:47:18,159 --> 00:47:21,118
little rip in the morning to get Yeah. I

1060
00:47:19,679 --> 00:47:22,799
always have that bag sitting there,

1061
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:24,160
right? So, it's it's kind of nice when I

1062
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:26,400
get up in the morning and I got a little

1063
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:28,480
bit of thing going on. I can plug that

1064
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,079
volcano in and I come out of the shower

1065
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:31,679
and it's there and I kind of walk around

1066
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:34,480
with the bag and set it down when I'm

1067
00:47:31,679 --> 00:47:37,039
doing things. So, well, the sublimator

1068
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:39,039
of course it's fixed with that. So,

1069
00:47:37,039 --> 00:47:40,559
little little little fun things.

1070
00:47:39,039 --> 00:47:42,800
Absolutely.

1071
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:44,799
Well, jeez, I don't know. You don't

1072
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:48,119
know? I don't. There's all this great

1073
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:52,079
hash on the table and just hit the

1074
00:47:48,119 --> 00:47:55,280
sublimate a couple times. What to do? I

1075
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:58,119
can feel that quite nicely. Mhm. Yeah.

1076
00:47:55,280 --> 00:48:00,720
Feeling nicely baked, you know? Feeling

1077
00:47:58,119 --> 00:48:03,119
like feeling like Mark Emory should be

1078
00:48:00,719 --> 00:48:05,118
out of jail and in Vancouver right now.

1079
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:06,480
He's popping on all of us. Yeah. Kind of

1080
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:08,160
feeling that right now. You know, it's

1081
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:10,079
like I don't know how long it's been

1082
00:48:08,159 --> 00:48:13,598
since our since the US said that they

1083
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:15,760
would let him go if Canada accepted him.

1084
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:17,760
But wow, we should really be getting in

1085
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:20,560
touch with the minister, you know. Well,

1086
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:25,160
6 months ago, like Jody was saying, it's

1087
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:25,159
uh it's unbelievable. Being labeled him

1088
00:48:26,639 --> 00:48:30,239
just doesn't look built upon the

1089
00:48:28,719 --> 00:48:32,399
government. You know, it's like, come

1090
00:48:30,239 --> 00:48:34,318
on, he's a Canadian. He's down in

1091
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:36,480
prison. If you want to keep him in jail,

1092
00:48:34,318 --> 00:48:38,960
keep him in jail, but do it up here.

1093
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:41,119
Bring him up here. Let him finish his

1094
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:45,199
sentence up here. He sold seeds. He did

1095
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:47,280
sell seeds. Wow. I I mean, it's crazy

1096
00:48:45,199 --> 00:48:48,879
that you can sell and be in jail in the

1097
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:50,720
US for 5 years. It's pretty

1098
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:52,318
unbelievable, which we've all talked

1099
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:54,239
about. It'll be good to have him back

1100
00:48:52,318 --> 00:48:57,159
anyway in July. I believe he's scheduled

1101
00:48:54,239 --> 00:49:01,118
to be released regardless of Canada's

1102
00:48:57,159 --> 00:49:03,279
um inability to accept him from the US.

1103
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:05,599
He will be released in uh July, I

1104
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:07,920
believe, Jody was saying. So, that'll be

1105
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:11,440
really good to have him back. And I'm

1106
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:14,440
sure he'll be doing the all the shows.

1107
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:17,079
the Afghan. You're going for some

1108
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:19,838
Afghani after all that. Hit

1109
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:22,680
it. See how that does for paint.

1110
00:49:19,838 --> 00:49:26,119
Apparently, this was chosen by all the

1111
00:49:22,679 --> 00:49:29,679
members. And uh

1112
00:49:26,119 --> 00:49:29,680
yeah, sure. Nice

1113
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:35,838
[Applause]

1114
00:49:33,159 --> 00:49:39,039
looking. Always nice to bump into other

1115
00:49:35,838 --> 00:49:42,119
hash makers. Matt is a a one of the

1116
00:49:39,039 --> 00:49:44,480
island hash makers. always got nice

1117
00:49:42,119 --> 00:49:45,760
product. House of the great gardener.

1118
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:49,039
These guys definitely know what they're

1119
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:50,640
doing. They've got the, in my opinion, a

1120
00:49:49,039 --> 00:49:52,960
good foundation. They're good people.

1121
00:49:50,639 --> 00:49:55,440
They're doing it for the right reasons

1122
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:58,000
and it shows in their end product, you

1123
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:59,318
know. Definitely nice. Tasty organic

1124
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:03,039
medicine. Oh,

1125
00:49:59,318 --> 00:50:05,759
exactly. You know, exactly.

1126
00:50:03,039 --> 00:50:06,558
Which is what we all want. Tasty organic

1127
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:08,559
medicine.

1128
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:10,480
It's nice, but I mean, come April 1st,

1129
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:13,519
I'm going to have to take all of this

1130
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:14,639
and mix it with cow batter and water and

1131
00:50:13,519 --> 00:50:17,199
put it over my curve. You know what?

1132
00:50:14,639 --> 00:50:19,279
What if we had a March 31st bubble man's

1133
00:50:17,199 --> 00:50:21,919
birthday bash, which just happens to

1134
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:23,359
actually be my birthday, March 31st.

1135
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:25,358
That would be like And we could I could

1136
00:50:23,358 --> 00:50:28,159
throw a party in Vancouver and invite

1137
00:50:25,358 --> 00:50:30,719
everyone down who has herb and hash that

1138
00:50:28,159 --> 00:50:33,279
they need to destroy and we'll have a

1139
00:50:30,719 --> 00:50:36,399
big destroy party. I think that's an

1140
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:38,480
awesome idea. Epic. Epic. I think it's

1141
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:40,880
gonna happen. Stay tuned for that. We'll

1142
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:42,480
see. That's a good thing, you know.

1143
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:44,519
We'll see what happens on that. I think

1144
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:46,639
it's going to be

1145
00:50:44,519 --> 00:50:49,358
So, all right, John and I are going to

1146
00:50:46,639 --> 00:50:51,039
finish a couple more rips here, but

1147
00:50:49,358 --> 00:50:52,639
we're going to end it here. We'll talk

1148
00:50:51,039 --> 00:50:57,679
to you soon. You might hear more about

1149
00:50:52,639 --> 00:51:01,598
this big end of the MMA license bash

1150
00:50:57,679 --> 00:51:05,199
with Bubble Man, John B, and many more.

1151
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:08,200
So, peace. Peace, guys. All

1152
00:51:05,199 --> 00:51:08,199
right.

1153
00:51:08,210 --> 00:51:25,429
