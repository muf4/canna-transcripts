Hey everybody, welcome back to the

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,599
Cannabis Journal Club. Uh we did just

3
00:00:06,878 --> 00:00:12,558
drop you one little gem here recently.

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,480
Uh Dr. Allen has another few revelations

5
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:18,960
that he wants to share with us. So Dr.

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:22,359
Allen, without further ado, please.

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,359
Thank you, Marcus.

8
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:29,679
Everybody knows this, but no one will

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,000
say it, that cannabis and hemp are in

10
00:00:29,678 --> 00:00:34,079
fact

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,960
money. And if you legalize cannabis or

12
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,960
hemp in your

13
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:40,679
state, money will come to your state in

14
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,640
one of two

15
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:47,119
fashions. If the citizens can grow, the

16
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,759
money will come to the citizens and they

17
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:52,558
will spend the money inside the state.

18
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:55,759
If the citizens are not allowed to grow,

19
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:58,959
then outofstate cannabis cartel carpet

20
00:00:55,759 --> 00:01:02,079
bagger companies will come to the state

21
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:05,359
and extort the citizens and spend the

22
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:07,760
money outside of the state. So, let the

23
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:07,760
people

24
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,640
grow. It'll change your economy.

25
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,799
Wonderful. Thank you so much for that

26
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,040
little tidbit. Uh, and we'll be back

27
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:24,400
soon with more Cannabis Journal Club.

28
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,400
Thanks for watching.
