2
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:14,160
ladies and gentlemen good morning it's

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,948
an absolute pleasure to be up here and

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,028
to be able to say so I see quite a few

5
00:00:15,948 --> 00:00:27,868
familiar faces out there

6
00:00:18,028 --> 00:00:30,359
I feel energy thank you it's my pleasure

7
00:00:27,868 --> 00:00:32,099
now to introduce two people one before

8
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,070
the break after the break the first one

9
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:36,988
dr. Ethan Russo

10
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:39,299
Ethan's us neither promise not to make

11
00:00:36,988 --> 00:00:41,968
this a 30 minute introduction of it it

12
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:44,718
can easily go beyond that but even as a

13
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:47,550
board-certified neurologist

studies there the dialects were going on

25
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:22,049
down in the states of that he's

26
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:23,250

him here today I just like to have a

43
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:09,770
wonderful note he's also a wonderful

[Applause]

46
00:02:43,209 --> 00:02:47,709
thank you it's a great pleasure to be

47
00:02:45,669 --> 00:02:49,509
here I am afraid we're going to be

48
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:53,860
moving from the sublime to the

49
00:02:49,509 --> 00:02:55,899
ridiculous but I don't disagree with any

50
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:59,620
philosophy you've heard so far this

51
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:03,549
morning I come to you with certainly as

52
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:06,640
an iconic the establishment but that is

53
00:03:03,549 --> 00:03:09,909
not the way I feel I also may be dressed

54
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:16,119
in the suit but in my heart I'm wearing

55
00:03:09,908 --> 00:03:19,060
hemp anyway my email is here those of

56
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:21,658
you who know me will admit that I answer

57
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:24,069
my email so well please feel free to

58
00:03:21,658 --> 00:03:27,039
take that down if you have subsequent

59
00:03:24,068 --> 00:03:31,388
questions and I may be busy but I will

60
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:34,259
get back to you so of course we're

61
00:03:31,389 --> 00:03:37,840
talking about the plant cannabis sativa

62
00:03:34,259 --> 00:03:40,328
cultivated cannabis and how this works

63
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,908
among other things it relates to the

64
00:03:40,329 --> 00:03:46,689
endocannabinoid system so we have this

65
00:03:42,908 --> 00:03:49,269
plant wasn't put on God's green earth to

66
00:03:46,688 --> 00:03:51,400
get us high because the plant has been

67
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:54,159
around a lot longer than the human

68
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,629
species but through a convenient

69
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:59,229
accident of nature

70
00:03:55,628 --> 00:04:02,439
it makes chemicals that react with our

71
00:03:59,229 --> 00:04:05,289
own receptors these are cannabinoid

72
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:08,919
receptors cb1 the psychoactive receptor

73
00:04:05,289 --> 00:04:13,449
and CP 2 and immunomodulatory

74
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:17,048
and pain believing receptor the reason

75
00:04:13,449 --> 00:04:20,519
this works is one chemical in particular

76
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:23,500
in cannabis THC resembles natural

77
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:27,430
cannabinoids within us the endogenous or

78
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:29,529
at endocannabinoids best known Erica

79
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:35,019
terminal glycerol and the end of mind

80
00:04:29,529 --> 00:04:38,469
and two AG he's bind to the receptors in

81
00:04:35,019 --> 00:04:40,930
the same way that THC does and the

82
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:43,330
endocannabinoid system is composed of

83
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:45,759
those endogenous chemicals these

84
00:04:43,329 --> 00:04:50,109
receptors and the enzymes that make that

85
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:52,899
would break them down now there's been a

86
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:55,930
great deal of confusion about what we

87
00:04:52,899 --> 00:04:59,469
should call cannabis beyond the hundreds

88
00:04:55,930 --> 00:05:03,160
of slang terms frequently you'll hear it

89
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:05,830
this is indica this is sativa on my

90
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,860
opinion this is all nonsense we could go

91
00:05:05,829 --> 00:05:11,109
into the Nitty Gritty of what is a

92
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:13,900
species we know that all cannabis can

93
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:17,259
interbreed what you really need to know

94
00:05:13,899 --> 00:05:19,810
is what's in it but will its effects be

95
00:05:17,259 --> 00:05:23,319
of course that depends to a certain

96
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:26,709
extent on the internal milieu of the set

97
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:28,870
and setting these inevitable things that

98
00:05:26,709 --> 00:05:33,409
we try to

99
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:35,840
but it is important to describe to plant

100
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:38,150
what does it look like is it tall as a

101
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:41,179
short is it broad-leaved as a narrow

102
00:05:38,149 --> 00:05:44,439
leaved more importantly what are its

103
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:46,908
components not just the kidnappin words

104
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:51,139
we're going to talk today a great deal

105
00:05:46,908 --> 00:05:54,860
about cannabis as beyond THC the other

106
00:05:51,139 --> 00:05:58,939
components that synergize and if you

107
00:05:54,860 --> 00:06:02,000
will really make it a gift to humanity

108
00:05:58,939 --> 00:06:04,038
rather than a bunch of chemicals which

109
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,129
is the way it's going to sound as I

110
00:06:04,038 --> 00:06:10,279
describe them we need to know the turbid

111
00:06:07,129 --> 00:06:14,810
content the essential oils that give

112
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:18,348
cannabis its unique scent we also need

113
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:20,240
to know the smell and taste and most

114
00:06:18,348 --> 00:06:23,060
importantly the effects that it might

115
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:28,280
provide particularly from a therapeutic

116
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:30,348
standpoint one manner of classification

117
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:33,468
that I found most useful is this one

118
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:36,250
that comes from paper research and if

119
00:06:33,468 --> 00:06:39,288
you concentrating the panel on the right

120
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:42,709
you'll see that there are a number of

121
00:06:39,288 --> 00:06:45,050
sections that describe the percentages

122
00:06:42,709 --> 00:06:48,120
of the cannabinoids and terpenoids

123
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:50,939
their proportions picture of the

124
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:53,250
but and then in the third panel you see

125
00:06:50,939 --> 00:06:55,709
something interesting other plants in

126
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:59,490
this instance of lemon and some

127
00:06:55,709 --> 00:07:02,189
peppercorns why is that it is because

128
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:05,490
the terpenoid content of limonene from

129
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:10,050
weapons and carry off a lien from black

130
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:12,889
pepper are also common to cannabis also

131
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:16,470
in the third panel you see nice colored

132
00:07:12,889 --> 00:07:18,750
wedges they give an idea of what people

133
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:23,010
have reported in terms of the effect

134
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:26,250
that this has had on and left third

135
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:29,550
panel you see a description of the smell

136
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:33,269
and taste when it's inhaled preferably

137
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:35,009
by by vaporization the bottom panel is

138
00:07:33,269 --> 00:07:36,870
most interesting to me because I think

139
00:07:35,009 --> 00:07:40,110
the terpenoids have been ignored and

140
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:43,709
these are really the refined aspects of

141
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:46,470
cannabis that give each type Akim of our

142
00:07:43,709 --> 00:07:49,019
chemical variety sometimes miss named

143
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:51,780
strains give them their unique

144
00:07:49,019 --> 00:07:54,240
attributes in this instance we'll see

145
00:07:51,779 --> 00:07:56,638
it's very high in limonene this is

146
00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:00,689
likely to produce an effect as an

147
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:03,629
antidepressant and bright agent and the

148
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:06,629
carry off lien of the blue very high

149
00:08:03,629 --> 00:08:10,769
mrs. Kermit being an agent that affects

150
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:14,310
cb2 produces anti information and

151
00:08:10,769 --> 00:08:17,519
reduces pain also at the bottom you see

152
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:19,410
a very narrow purple bar this is mercy

153
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:22,079
mercy is usually Pradhan

154
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:24,210
most key burst of cannabis and is

155
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:27,209
responsible for the couch lock and

156
00:08:24,209 --> 00:08:31,109
sedation that is all too common with

157
00:08:27,209 --> 00:08:35,340
most commercial types of cannabis but

158
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:37,139
there's so much more than that as we

159
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:39,149
follow through this panel which comes

160
00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:41,610
from an upcoming book chapter that it

161
00:08:39,149 --> 00:08:44,009
did with jae-hyun our COO we moved from

162
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:45,960
the plant into the leaf to the

163
00:08:44,009 --> 00:08:48,659
unfertilized in the flower and

164
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:51,990
particularly in the upper right to its

165
00:08:48,659 --> 00:08:55,529
trichomes the real action area of the

166
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:58,259
cannabis flower where the cannabinoids

167
00:08:55,529 --> 00:09:00,659
and terpenoids are produced but beyond

168
00:08:58,259 --> 00:09:03,360
that we have the beautiful chemistry of

169
00:09:00,659 --> 00:09:07,230
the seeds even the sprouts as we'll get

170
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:11,009
into on so and then the roots the roots

171
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:13,980
have none of the same chemicals that are

172
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:15,720
in the flowers and vice versa but they

173
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:18,690
also have a remarkable healing power

174
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,960
that heretofore has been largely ignored

175
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:24,510
in modern societies

176
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:26,269
the chemistry part so these are the

177
00:09:24,509 --> 00:09:28,980
vital cannabinoids the plant

178
00:09:26,269 --> 00:09:31,620
communicates and you'll see a bunch here

179
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:35,759
most familiar to me THC and cannabidiol

180
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:39,750
but there are all of these depicted here

181
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:40,029
have had sufficient investigation to

182
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:43,269
know

183
00:09:40,029 --> 00:09:47,649
what their pharmacological effects and

184
00:09:43,269 --> 00:09:50,019
what the therapeutic effects may be and

185
00:09:47,649 --> 00:09:52,659
this is the buy synthetic pathway by

186
00:09:50,019 --> 00:09:54,819
which the cannabinoids that remain we're

187
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:58,240
not going to go through in detail we're

188
00:09:54,820 --> 00:10:00,490
gonna focus on one precursor one of the

189
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:04,570
parent chemicals geranyl pyrophosphate

190
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:06,789
and as you see this is a parent chemical

191
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:09,340
not just for the cannabinoids but if you

192
00:10:06,789 --> 00:10:12,759
follow it to the right it also has a

193
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:13,210
parent compound for the interpreter

194
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:15,490
winds

195
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:17,580
so the cannabinoids and terpenoids are

196
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:20,560
half-siblings and as I like to say

197
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:24,460
unlike its unblended family as they get

198
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:26,649
along beautifully let's talk a little

199
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:28,600
bit about THC of course this is going to

200
00:10:26,649 --> 00:10:31,689
be most familiar to you and there are

201
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:33,909
many people and governments out there

202
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:36,220
that would like you to believe that all

203
00:10:33,909 --> 00:10:38,980
the pharmacology of cannabis relates to

204
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:42,850
this one chemical this is so far from

205
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:45,009
true if it were true in 1985 cannabis

206
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:48,460
would have disappeared because synthetic

207
00:10:45,009 --> 00:10:50,889
THC is marinol became available when any

208
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:54,460
money was taken it will tell you it's a

209
00:10:50,889 --> 00:10:57,129
lousy drug with no therapeutic index the

210
00:10:54,460 --> 00:11:00,639
difference between the amount that will

211
00:10:57,129 --> 00:11:02,820
produce benefit perhaps on symptoms and

212
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:05,590
the amount that produces side-effects is

213
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:08,140
negligible but they're like this with

214
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:10,950
cannabis it can be like this a huge

215
00:11:08,139 --> 00:11:15,279
merchant of state DM to the right

216
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:18,550
this does bind to CP 1 in the brain and

217
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:20,709
elsewhere it of course has pink healing

218
00:11:18,549 --> 00:11:22,839
properties directly it's also a

219
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:25,480
bronchodilator and opens up the lungs

220
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:27,759
and there used to be cannabis cigarettes

221
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:31,659
for asthma the smoke Burke wasn't

222
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:34,269
helpful but the THC was beyond the

223
00:11:31,659 --> 00:11:37,329
receptor activity it's a very strong

224
00:11:34,269 --> 00:11:39,929
painkiller an anti-inflammatory 20 times

225
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:43,170
the anti-inflammatory capacity of

226
00:11:39,929 --> 00:11:46,269
aspirin and twice that of hydrocortisone

227
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:50,169
it also the muscle relaxant that's the

228
00:11:46,269 --> 00:11:52,000
basis for its approval as santa been

229
00:11:50,169 --> 00:11:54,819
excessive prescription medicine in

230
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,480
canada and 20 other countries around the

231
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:59,410
world and of course it's an antiemetic

232
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:03,879
particularly in situations like

233
00:11:59,409 --> 00:12:06,519
chemotherapy and we're going to spend

234
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:08,919
more time i can have a dial TC gets one

235
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:13,449
slide today I forgot before I can have a

236
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:15,579
dial so this is non-intoxicating Guinea

237
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:18,370
here it's non psychoactive that isn't

238
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:21,220
true because it does affect the brain

239
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:23,500
it's an anti-anxiety agent that can

240
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:26,230
counteract the effect of too much THC

241
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:29,559
it's also an anti-psychotic there have

242
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:34,480
been now two phase two

243
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:37,299
trials of either CBD alone or as an

244
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,940
extract in treating schizophrenia with

245
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:43,599
less side effects than conventional

246
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:46,420
medicines it is a very interesting

247
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:49,060
property it doesn't bind to the cb1

248
00:12:46,419 --> 00:12:52,419
receptor but when it's around even in

249
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:54,969
tiny amounts it antagonizes the effect

250
00:12:52,419 --> 00:12:57,159
of THC now that may sound like a bad

251
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:59,769
thing but it isn't what it's doing is

252
00:12:57,159 --> 00:13:04,389
counteracting some of the less desirable

253
00:12:59,769 --> 00:13:06,389
effects of THC while also boosting is P

254
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:09,309
killing and anti-inflammatory properties

255
00:13:06,389 --> 00:13:12,850
it was recently discovered that it does

256
00:13:09,309 --> 00:13:15,519
this through being a negative allosteric

257
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:18,370
modulator this is a way of saying it's

258
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:21,759
not binding here or a TC does but over

259
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:22,419
here and me P it produces live long and

260
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:25,750
prosper

261
00:13:22,419 --> 00:13:28,259
and as we together I don't know I just

262
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,259
made that up

263
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:36,940
you've heard that before oh it isn't

264
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:39,370
neuroprotective antioxidant is much more

265
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:42,850
powerful than vitamin C or vitamin E in

266
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:45,879
this regard and me and the future be

267
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:47,860
used under conditions of insults of the

268
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:50,919
brain whether it be strokes and injury

269
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:53,528
etcetera it also is what's called a trip

270
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:56,469
v1 agonist like capsaicin the active

271
00:13:53,528 --> 00:13:58,509
ingredient in Chili Peppers and so this

272
00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:03,190
is important in treating a number of

273
00:13:58,509 --> 00:14:08,169
neuropathic pain conditions one of its

274
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:11,950
primary effects over time may be that it

275
00:14:08,169 --> 00:14:14,559
is a modulator at the endocannabinoid

276
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:18,190
system it boosts the amount of entered

277
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:21,669
cannabinoid inand amide and inhibits its

278
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:25,950
breakdown on overtime this may be a very

279
00:14:21,669 --> 00:14:28,539
powerful effect it is a very strong

280
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:31,899
anticonvulsant I expect that epic

281
00:14:28,539 --> 00:14:34,509
dialects which is a predominantly

282
00:14:31,899 --> 00:14:38,500
cannabidiol extract will be fda-approved

283
00:14:34,509 --> 00:14:42,240
later this year the problem will be when

284
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:42,240
we see what it costs

285
00:14:42,889 --> 00:14:49,068
that remains to be seen as mentioned in

286
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:51,350
anti-anxiety agent in high doses CBD

287
00:14:49,068 --> 00:14:54,858
shares with the other cannabinoids a

288
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:57,920
unique ability to selectively kill

289
00:14:54,859 --> 00:15:01,278
cancer cells while being preservative

290
00:14:57,919 --> 00:15:03,828
for normal cells this is exactly 180

291
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:06,289
degrees from conventional chemotherapy

292
00:15:03,828 --> 00:15:08,838
where it's generally toxic and you hope

293
00:15:06,289 --> 00:15:13,308
that you kill the tumor before you lose

294
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:17,350
all your hair or you've got wine so this

295
00:15:13,308 --> 00:15:17,350
really needs to move forward

296
00:15:19,058 --> 00:15:26,659
additionally has a wide variety another

297
00:15:22,928 --> 00:15:30,188
25 mechanisms of medicine that account

298
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:33,588
for it being a strong anti-inflammatory

299
00:15:30,188 --> 00:15:36,798
additionally how it works as an 18 xiety

300
00:15:33,589 --> 00:15:40,779
it's mediated through serotonin as are a

301
00:15:36,798 --> 00:15:42,649
number of other effects including

302
00:15:40,778 --> 00:15:47,809
disturbances of thinking

303
00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:50,539
in advanced liver disease potentially it

304
00:15:47,809 --> 00:15:53,719
could either fear with slow viruses men

305
00:15:50,539 --> 00:15:55,610
count disease and things like there is

306
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,259
not the likelihood we'll ever have a

307
00:15:55,610 --> 00:16:00,019
clinical trial in those disorders

308
00:15:57,259 --> 00:16:03,019
because fortunately they're pretty rare

309
00:16:00,019 --> 00:16:05,899
a recent one that's interesting is that

310
00:16:03,019 --> 00:16:09,139
CBD promotes bone healing in the future

311
00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:12,259
it may be that this heretofore forbidden

312
00:16:09,139 --> 00:16:15,949
drug is used to treat athletes that

313
00:16:12,259 --> 00:16:18,169
break limbs in sports now there are a

314
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:20,900
lot of misconceptions about seeking a

315
00:16:18,169 --> 00:16:24,169
recently written articles specifically

316
00:16:20,899 --> 00:16:29,360
addressing those misconceptions one is

317
00:16:24,169 --> 00:16:32,120
on some purveyors will say oh it's got a

318
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:35,539
point five percent CBD as if that's a

319
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:38,120
great thing this is a wonderful compound

320
00:16:35,539 --> 00:16:40,759
however it's not quote that's a way of

321
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:44,029
saying he need a good amount of it to

322
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:45,799
exert these beneficial effects we've

323
00:16:44,029 --> 00:16:49,539
already addressed this one it is

324
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:53,029
psychoactive it's non-intoxicating if

325
00:16:49,539 --> 00:16:54,980
for lack of a better word all you will

326
00:16:53,029 --> 00:16:58,519
commonly hear that it's a dating it is

327
00:16:54,980 --> 00:17:01,639
not pure CBD is actually quite alerting

328
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:04,119
the problem is that most key movers have

329
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:07,088
keep that you have cannabidiol

330
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:09,759
any amount also a very high immersing

331
00:17:07,088 --> 00:17:13,389
the couch light factor and so this is

332
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:17,379
created a misconception in there and we

333
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:19,169
have proved with eg Ximena like that

334
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:21,819
this is an alerting molecule

335
00:17:19,169 --> 00:17:26,140
south-of-the-border you'll commonly hear

336
00:17:21,818 --> 00:17:27,938
some base CVD purveyors claim that it's

337
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:31,080
legal in all 50 states

338
00:17:27,939 --> 00:17:34,980
it isn't it is illegal in all 50 states

339
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:38,288
it's just that the law has not been

340
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:39,038
prosecuted I didn't say the way it

341
00:17:38,288 --> 00:17:40,960
should be

342
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:43,778
because I don't believe that at all but

343
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:47,409
if you want to know what the lodge

344
00:17:43,778 --> 00:17:50,038
really says it is illegal the problem

345
00:17:47,409 --> 00:17:53,919
being that the Controlled Substances Act

346
00:17:50,038 --> 00:17:56,319
allows hemp stocks and seeds if they're

347
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,840
clean but once you go and extract

348
00:17:56,319 --> 00:18:01,028
chemicals from them it is an exception

349
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:04,538
to the exception and they're illegal

350
00:18:01,028 --> 00:18:07,119
again another one when this came up last

351
00:18:04,538 --> 00:18:11,019
year in an article where they stimulated

352
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:14,319
gastric acid exposed CBD to it for an

353
00:18:11,019 --> 00:18:18,369
hour and got some of it to turn into KC

354
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:20,798
this does not happen in your body it

355
00:18:18,369 --> 00:18:22,839
doesn't hang around for an hour even

356
00:18:20,798 --> 00:18:23,929
though this reaction has been known

357
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:26,898
since night

358
00:18:23,929 --> 00:18:29,179
forty it does not occur in the human

359
00:18:26,898 --> 00:18:33,729
body and you have known in semantic

360
00:18:29,179 --> 00:18:36,379
equipment to convert CBD in Bettina see

361
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:38,440
this shows some the same things the

362
00:18:36,378 --> 00:18:42,368
natural history from the count plant

363
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:46,730
down to the pure crystalline chemical

364
00:18:42,368 --> 00:18:49,278
and as you see in the last part your

365
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:51,999
body converts it into something else 7

366
00:18:49,278 --> 00:18:56,148
min ago ex-ac media doesn't convert it

367
00:18:51,999 --> 00:18:59,089
into THC you can do that in the test

368
00:18:56,148 --> 00:19:01,038
tube now in each and you meet your

369
00:18:59,089 --> 00:19:05,538
effort less about tetrahydrocannabinol

370
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:08,089
Baron this is president small amounts in

371
00:19:05,538 --> 00:19:14,028
cannabis from southern Africa South

372
00:19:08,089 --> 00:19:16,579
Africa Zimbabwe etc for a long time it

373
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:18,648
wasn't known how this worked but it's an

374
00:19:16,579 --> 00:19:21,019
interesting chemical in that at low

375
00:19:18,648 --> 00:19:23,778
concentrations that's in the antagonist

376
00:19:21,019 --> 00:19:25,940
yet cb1 what's called a neutral

377
00:19:23,778 --> 00:19:28,730
antagonist so it's quite different to

378
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:31,039
run them again if weight loss drug that

379
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:33,680
was subsequently yanked from the market

380
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:35,869
as a horrible side effects that actually

381
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:37,460
knocks down the activity the

382
00:19:35,869 --> 00:19:40,879
endocannabinoid system

383
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:46,279
it's just occupies space and receptor

384
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:49,610
and would allay hunger and help with the

385
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:52,460
metabolic syndrome that is affecting so

386
00:19:49,609 --> 00:19:55,939
many people in Western societies so he

387
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:58,539
has been shown to produce weight loss in

388
00:19:55,940 --> 00:20:04,240
the obese it's also storing

389
00:19:58,539 --> 00:20:08,779
anticonvulsant and also a painkiller

390
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:10,519
so unfortunately aside from GW

391
00:20:08,779 --> 00:20:13,789
Pharmaceuticals which has a plan that

392
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:14,599
has 92 percent of its cannabinoids as th

393
00:20:13,789 --> 00:20:17,450
CV

394
00:20:14,599 --> 00:20:20,029
there's nothing analogous elsewhere but

395
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:23,539
this could come about with selective

396
00:20:20,029 --> 00:20:29,960
breeding not with genetic modification

397
00:20:23,539 --> 00:20:33,920
to which I'm totally against so moving

398
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:35,750
back for a second on TV is like teensy

399
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:39,920
but with a three carbon sidechain

400
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:41,480
instead of five so that brings us to CBD

401
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:45,890
P can have a diaper

402
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:50,000
it is like CBD with the three carbons

403
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:53,090
sidechain um this is a interesting

404
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,220
anticonvulsant you know that CBD is an

405
00:20:53,089 --> 00:20:58,579
anticonvulsant this works on a different

406
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:59,269
type of seizures seizures of a partial

407
00:20:58,579 --> 00:21:01,669
onset

408
00:20:59,269 --> 00:21:05,900
focal seizures and maybe that the two

409
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:10,430
together are gonna make a better job as

410
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:14,960
presented in the plant now it will also

411
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:18,140
care a lot about the raw acid

412
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:22,090
cannabinoids so what the planet

413
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:24,920
generally makes it's not THC but TCA

414
00:21:22,089 --> 00:21:29,000
tetrahydrocannabinol like acid some will

415
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:31,700
convert indicates a in the plan if we

416
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,759
look carefully at literature of the past

417
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:38,269
there were a lot of medical uses for raw

418
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:41,240
cannabis that wasn't decarboxylated

419
00:21:38,269 --> 00:21:44,750
where you lose the co2 group on the

420
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:47,569
molecule and this largely revolved

421
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:51,170
around its anti-inflammatory properties

422
00:21:47,569 --> 00:21:53,689
and abilities to treat a tumor it does

423
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:54,680
something that teach he does not affect

424
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:57,650
something called

425
00:21:54,680 --> 00:22:01,390
tumor necrosis factor-alpha it's very

426
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:03,890
important in certain autoimmune diseases

427
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:07,910
inflammatory bowel conditions also

428
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:11,180
rheumatoid arthritis man it's also being

429
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:12,920
used successfully in small amounts to

430
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:17,900
trade seizure disorders that have

431
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:20,840
responded to THC or CBD predominant

432
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:22,519
preparations now why this is isn't clear

433
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:25,279
because there's a lot about this we

434
00:22:22,519 --> 00:22:27,529
don't understand it seemingly does not

435
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:30,139
cross the blood-brain barrier that

436
00:22:27,529 --> 00:22:32,420
filter system that keeps toxins out of

437
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:33,600
the brain but we know in seizures that

438
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:35,999
that rate

439
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:38,248
and maybe it just gets them to the

440
00:22:35,999 --> 00:22:41,669
extent it needs to and people that have

441
00:22:38,249 --> 00:22:45,058
that kind of problem also it's unclear

442
00:22:41,669 --> 00:22:47,639
whether this binds to that cb1 receptor

443
00:22:45,058 --> 00:22:51,108
some experiments of safety on others and

444
00:22:47,638 --> 00:22:54,238
said no it's an inherently unstable

445
00:22:51,108 --> 00:22:56,569
molecule and so if it converts to th see

446
00:22:54,239 --> 00:23:01,139
if you could get some spurious results

447
00:22:56,569 --> 00:23:04,108
bottom line we're studying it so it has

448
00:23:01,138 --> 00:23:07,138
a counterpart in cannabidiol I guess and

449
00:23:04,108 --> 00:23:10,528
CBD a so this is what CBD looks like

450
00:23:07,138 --> 00:23:12,298
before it decarboxylation this is a

451
00:23:10,528 --> 00:23:14,970
natural herbicide

452
00:23:12,298 --> 00:23:17,429
hemp reading plans were infamous for

453
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:20,909
producing good weed killers also killing

454
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:23,729
worms and things of this story it seems

455
00:23:20,909 --> 00:23:25,919
to be an extremely powerful antiemetic

456
00:23:23,729 --> 00:23:31,348
against nausea about a hundred times

457
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:33,749
more powerful than CBD so again it looks

458
00:23:31,348 --> 00:23:36,749
also based on the historical literature

459
00:23:33,749 --> 00:23:39,629
that this was a very very effective

460
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:42,419
agent in treating tumors if you look at

461
00:23:39,628 --> 00:23:45,329
the renaissance herbalist in europe they

462
00:23:42,419 --> 00:23:47,940
were always discussing raw amp as a

463
00:23:45,329 --> 00:23:52,319
treatment for tumors so a great deal

464
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:55,649
more work needed there this is taken

465
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:57,289
from 2011 article called taming TSE and

466
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:59,559
you see again

467
00:23:57,289 --> 00:24:03,889
a number of different familiar plants

468
00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:07,029
that depict their representative scents

469
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:12,070
that are also finding in cannabis on

470
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:15,109
basically the terpenoids are antibiotic

471
00:24:12,069 --> 00:24:19,369
anti-inflammatory there are often things

472
00:24:15,109 --> 00:24:23,719
that work on emotions and synergize with

473
00:24:19,369 --> 00:24:25,369
THC monitor birds are the ones with ten

474
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:27,110
carbons and you'll see that there's some

475
00:24:25,369 --> 00:24:30,169
different structures but what they have

476
00:24:27,109 --> 00:24:33,589
in common is as ten card ten carbon

477
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:36,860
structure no nitrogen and all a

478
00:24:33,589 --> 00:24:38,779
difference very powerfully and we'll

479
00:24:36,859 --> 00:24:42,919
talk about some now there's a lot of

480
00:24:38,779 --> 00:24:45,440
fine print here I did this to try and

481
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:48,110
impress but we're not gonna read all of

482
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:52,160
these what I want to say what else up I

483
00:24:48,109 --> 00:24:56,629
mean is it is much too little abundant

484
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:58,850
in modern Canada scheme of ours a lot of

485
00:24:56,630 --> 00:25:01,880
people particularly people my age the

486
00:24:58,849 --> 00:25:04,579
great years of a wax prosaic about the

487
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:07,520
cannabis of the past because you know

488
00:25:04,579 --> 00:25:09,919
remember that strain you know the one

489
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:13,220
where you can smoke as much as you like

490
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:15,350
and still have a clear head well there

491
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:19,569
isn't much of that around these days and

492
00:25:15,349 --> 00:25:22,929
the reason is a lack of pining paintings

493
00:25:19,569 --> 00:25:25,309
is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor

494
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:27,950
acetylcholine is the memory

495
00:25:25,309 --> 00:25:32,960
neurotransmitter in the brain so if it's

496
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:35,440
broken down too rapidly you forget what

497
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:38,960
was I saying

498
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:41,690
okay that's fun if you need to forget

499
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:46,600
how lousy a day you have at work I'm

500
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:49,429
going to prick your your boss was but

501
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:51,618
under other conditions if you're in pain

502
00:25:49,429 --> 00:25:52,278
and you have to work or study you need

503
00:25:51,618 --> 00:25:54,319
this

504
00:25:52,278 --> 00:25:58,999
the counteract that short-term memory

505
00:25:54,319 --> 00:26:01,278
impairment so in addition to that it's

506
00:25:58,999 --> 00:26:05,659
really a phenomenal antibiotic to

507
00:26:01,278 --> 00:26:07,819
broad-spectrum in you know it's just

508
00:26:05,659 --> 00:26:09,950
great for clearing the head the Japanese

509
00:26:07,819 --> 00:26:12,980
have a wonderful term for this they call

510
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:16,129
it shinrin yoku which is called forest

511
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:18,200
bathing and for anybody else the fortune

512
00:26:16,128 --> 00:26:21,378
as most of us do to live in the

513
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:23,330
northwest but life gets you down you

514
00:26:21,378 --> 00:26:26,209
need to take a walk and in evergreen

515
00:26:23,329 --> 00:26:31,038
forest because that mining in the air is

516
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:34,490
gonna clear there all right next merci

517
00:26:31,038 --> 00:26:36,470
um this is a very useful molecule if you

518
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:39,159
need to sleep and it does have a

519
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:43,038
analgesic effects it actually is a very

520
00:26:39,159 --> 00:26:45,769
narcotic liked effect so this practice

521
00:26:43,038 --> 00:26:49,038
is of pain relief that responds to

522
00:26:45,769 --> 00:26:51,288
naloxone no lock zone is the opiate

523
00:26:49,038 --> 00:26:54,200
blocker the same thing they give on the

524
00:26:51,288 --> 00:26:55,980
street on the east side to people who've

525
00:26:54,200 --> 00:27:01,410
overdosed on heroin

526
00:26:55,980 --> 00:27:03,990
Janell okay but this is all too

527
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:06,419
prevalent due to modern breeding

528
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:09,750
techniques and produces this couch lock

529
00:27:06,419 --> 00:27:12,390
that you know again some people like

530
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:14,400
that a lot of people don't and again if

531
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:18,780
you have to work or study it's just not

532
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:21,660
conducive to that lightning I've

533
00:27:18,779 --> 00:27:24,240
mentioned before again this is more

534
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:27,630
common in the olden days but certainly

535
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:30,210
can be brought back you've all

536
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:32,790
experienced this if you walk down the

537
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:35,720
aisle in the supermarket there's a bunch

538
00:27:32,789 --> 00:27:38,730
of artificial limonene in there because

539
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:41,940
psychologically we equate this with

540
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:43,919
cleanliness and bright thoughts but

541
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:46,590
that's not just psychological it is a

542
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:50,278
biochemical you can do the same thing by

543
00:27:46,589 --> 00:27:53,648
running your thumb on a citrus rind

544
00:27:50,278 --> 00:27:57,368
and you'll get that but this is a very

545
00:27:53,648 --> 00:28:00,598
powerful antidepressant in Japan they

546
00:27:57,368 --> 00:28:03,218
did a interesting trial hospitalized

547
00:28:00,598 --> 00:28:05,888
depressed patients they cut their

548
00:28:03,219 --> 00:28:09,338
depression scores in half got most of

549
00:28:05,888 --> 00:28:12,728
them off other standard antidepressant

550
00:28:09,338 --> 00:28:17,588
drug regimens and it's also a very

551
00:28:12,729 --> 00:28:19,028
powerful in the instrument it has some

552
00:28:17,588 --> 00:28:21,788
other facts that are still being

553
00:28:19,028 --> 00:28:26,259
explored on a thing called adenosine a

554
00:28:21,788 --> 00:28:28,118
2a where THC and CBD both work but three

555
00:28:26,259 --> 00:28:31,358
different mechanisms there's some kind

556
00:28:28,118 --> 00:28:35,048
of synergy going on there that I with my

557
00:28:31,358 --> 00:28:37,718
colleagues are exploring now little ole

558
00:28:35,048 --> 00:28:40,148
this again may be familiar for those of

559
00:28:37,719 --> 00:28:45,399
these still are grandmothers who may

560
00:28:40,148 --> 00:28:48,278
have the lavender about for its various

561
00:28:45,398 --> 00:28:51,758
beneficial properties very powerful

562
00:28:48,278 --> 00:28:53,648
eating xiety agent also spectacular

563
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:56,409
local anaesthetic

564
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:58,328
if you cook you should keep a bottle of

565
00:28:56,409 --> 00:29:01,709
lavender essential oil in the fridge

566
00:28:58,328 --> 00:29:05,769
when you get a burn just put it on meat

567
00:29:01,709 --> 00:29:07,479
cover it with an ice cube and the beam

568
00:29:05,769 --> 00:29:11,769
will be gone in a few minutes and

569
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:14,048
there's almost no chance of a blister it

570
00:29:11,769 --> 00:29:16,450
also has a powerful anticonvulsant we've

571
00:29:14,048 --> 00:29:20,078
now had documentation from my colleagues

572
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:22,160
Dustin Sulak and Bonnie goldstein of the

573
00:29:20,078 --> 00:29:26,720
presence of a small amount of

574
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:28,788
in given Kiev are producing the key

575
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:32,240
difference in the ability to control

576
00:29:28,788 --> 00:29:37,940
seizures and children taking cannabis

577
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:39,769
first treatment so we move on to the

578
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:42,650
secretary points we're only going to

579
00:29:39,769 --> 00:29:44,389
discuss one today these are 15 carbon

580
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:48,559
molecules a little bit higher molecular

581
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:52,450
weight foremost among these is carry off

582
00:29:48,558 --> 00:29:55,099
lien which is often the predominant

583
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:57,890
remaining turpenoid in the extracts

584
00:29:55,099 --> 00:29:58,629
which tend to burn off the monitored

585
00:29:57,890 --> 00:30:01,549
monoids

586
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:02,659
now it's been known for a long time that

587
00:30:01,548 --> 00:30:06,230
this is a very powerful

588
00:30:02,659 --> 00:30:08,870
anti-inflammatory agent but unlike all

589
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:11,029
the non-steroidal drugs out there and

590
00:30:08,869 --> 00:30:13,668
produce ulcers this is a guest or a

591
00:30:11,029 --> 00:30:17,210
protective it actually prevents that

592
00:30:13,669 --> 00:30:19,190
kind of involvement it was only ten

593
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:21,319
years ago that it was discovered that

594
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:23,870
this is not just a terpenoid but a

595
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:27,439
cannabinoid is small because it works

596
00:30:23,869 --> 00:30:31,119
selectively on that cb2 receptor the non

597
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:35,500
psychoactive receptor that mediates

598
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:39,678
inflammation and pain so what we've got

599
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:41,808
is in the pharmacology wrong there are a

600
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:44,990
bunch of companies working on synthetic

601
00:30:41,808 --> 00:30:48,769
cp2 agonist that would do the same thing

602
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:52,700
but they've all failed mainly due to

603
00:30:48,769 --> 00:30:53,990
toxicity modern pharmacology usually

604
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:57,440
rests around

605
00:30:53,990 --> 00:31:00,289
FIO receptor using a computer design

606
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:03,230
molecule that will Lodge there the

607
00:31:00,289 --> 00:31:05,569
highest affinity and highest potency you

608
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:07,549
work on that for seven years spent six

609
00:31:05,569 --> 00:31:10,519
hundred million dollars and find out

610
00:31:07,549 --> 00:31:12,500
that it causes aplastic anemia or liver

611
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:18,200
failure or something else that's

612
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:20,558
backwards rather on plants hemp and

613
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:24,710
medicine for almost all of our history

614
00:31:20,558 --> 00:31:26,690
just a hundred years where we decided in

615
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:28,990
our hubris that we could do it better

616
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:35,539
than nature and I think we've been wrong

617
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:37,819
for the most part this also appears to

618
00:31:35,539 --> 00:31:41,420
be an agent that could fight addictions

619
00:31:37,819 --> 00:31:44,329
to other substances we know from animal

620
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:47,300
work with synthetics that rats who were

621
00:31:44,329 --> 00:31:50,000
trained to be addicted to cocaine will

622
00:31:47,299 --> 00:31:52,279
stop pressing a lever together when

623
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,660
they're exposed to cb2 agonist so we

624
00:31:52,279 --> 00:31:58,339
could do the same thing with carry

625
00:31:53,660 --> 00:32:01,460
awfully dirty and with no risk of those

626
00:31:58,339 --> 00:32:03,439
toxicities so we move on to what I'd

627
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:05,179
like to call the cannabis odds and ends

628
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,788
and there's a reason for that because

629
00:32:05,179 --> 00:32:10,298
the

630
00:32:06,788 --> 00:32:15,729
dogs are involved again a lot of fine

631
00:32:10,298 --> 00:32:18,338
print here freed Ellen is us a trite or

632
00:32:15,729 --> 00:32:23,739
annoyed a thirty carbon molecule

633
00:32:18,338 --> 00:32:25,138
none of the tops just in the roots so

634
00:32:23,739 --> 00:32:28,298
this is a very powerful

635
00:32:25,138 --> 00:32:30,098
anti-inflammatory agent again a not one

636
00:32:28,298 --> 00:32:31,838
that's going to be permit all the side

637
00:32:30,098 --> 00:32:34,658
effects from under on steroids

638
00:32:31,838 --> 00:32:37,708
and it's shown benefit against a number

639
00:32:34,659 --> 00:32:40,569
of cancer cell lines

640
00:32:37,709 --> 00:32:43,089
this is particularly intriguing although

641
00:32:40,568 --> 00:32:45,668
the roots don't make a tremendous amount

642
00:32:43,088 --> 00:32:48,338
of this we know one must be working

643
00:32:45,669 --> 00:32:50,799
because they're any number of people

644
00:32:48,338 --> 00:32:53,528
particularly Natasha R is is going to be

645
00:32:50,798 --> 00:32:55,868
speaking to you later that are using

646
00:32:53,528 --> 00:32:59,769
this in artisanal preparations to great

647
00:32:55,868 --> 00:33:03,338
advantage to treat skin inflammation and

648
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:08,798
other disorders it also can be taken

649
00:33:03,338 --> 00:33:11,769
internally so this is really intriguing

650
00:33:08,798 --> 00:33:15,190
to me because as it is for throwing this

651
00:33:11,769 --> 00:33:18,568
stuff away so we have a neglected herbal

652
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:20,828
resource of possibly great value here

653
00:33:18,568 --> 00:33:22,588
similarly there's an agent you probably

654
00:33:20,828 --> 00:33:26,269
haven't heard of called canna preen

655
00:33:22,588 --> 00:33:30,528
another potential maintain flam

656
00:33:26,269 --> 00:33:33,108
agent is in a fear concentration in the

657
00:33:30,528 --> 00:33:34,909
leaves and for those of you taking

658
00:33:33,108 --> 00:33:36,708
pictures all this is going to come out

659
00:33:34,909 --> 00:33:40,039
in that article that would be published

660
00:33:36,709 --> 00:33:42,849
in August so if you want to contact me

661
00:33:40,038 --> 00:33:46,158
then we'll get you the key information

662
00:33:42,848 --> 00:33:49,668
and we should forget the seeds mostly

663
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:52,659
we're dealing with sin Samir ganja the

664
00:33:49,669 --> 00:33:55,429
unfertilized female flowers but when

665
00:33:52,659 --> 00:33:58,489
allowed to fertilize itself it makes

666
00:33:55,429 --> 00:34:00,649
this wonderful seed which is probably

667
00:33:58,489 --> 00:34:04,009
the most complete single food on earth

668
00:34:00,648 --> 00:34:08,179
in that it has a digestible protein in

669
00:34:04,009 --> 00:34:13,760
Destin a perfect balance of omega-3 and

670
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:15,528
omega-6 essential fatty acids and you

671
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,990
know if you had to pick one food upon

672
00:34:15,528 --> 00:34:22,250
which to survive this would be a good

673
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:25,068
choice now the interesting Lee um when

674
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:28,639
you sprout it other things happen Kim

675
00:34:25,068 --> 00:34:32,898
Fleeman is what's called a flavor an

676
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:37,010
anti-inflammatory chemical it was

677
00:34:32,898 --> 00:34:38,898
discovered about 25 years ago it's never

678
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:41,480
gonna be developed as a job because

679
00:34:38,898 --> 00:34:45,259
can't flame behaves too hard to separate

680
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:48,139
from can flavor and be so to purify it's

681
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:50,180
too difficult which is good for us

682
00:34:48,139 --> 00:34:52,909
it raises the possibility that could be

683
00:34:50,179 --> 00:34:56,960
used as an herbal agent and it's been

684
00:34:52,909 --> 00:34:59,179
discovered that when you sprout this you

685
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:01,460
increase the amount of canned flavor and

686
00:34:59,179 --> 00:35:02,690
if you have the right caliber cannabis

687
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:05,510
it's not yes

688
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:09,200
yep producing cannabinoids so it might

689
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:11,240
be legal in a number of jurisdictions so

690
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:14,299
this is a very promising agent for the

691
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:17,299
future again not affecting cox-1 and

692
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:20,380
cox-2 with all their side effects to

693
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:22,789
produce ulcers strokes and heart attacks

694
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:27,230
to finish off I want to give you some

695
00:35:22,789 --> 00:35:31,250
examples using the fighter facts what

696
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:33,889
they can do now this is a type 1 plan TT

697
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:35,840
predominant this is mostly what is

698
00:35:33,889 --> 00:35:38,389
available out there in the realm of

699
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:40,820
cannabis commerce but this one's called

700
00:35:38,389 --> 00:35:43,639
type 1 climbing and the reason is you

701
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:47,510
see the big green bar so we have an

702
00:35:43,639 --> 00:35:47,980
agent very rich in THC but yeah low and

703
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:51,650
merci

704
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:54,079
elucidation high in mining not having

705
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:56,420
that short term memory impairment and so

706
00:35:54,079 --> 00:36:01,269
if you needed THC to treat your muscle

707
00:35:56,420 --> 00:36:04,970
spasticity spasms or pain good choice

708
00:36:01,269 --> 00:36:07,639
type 2 plants have roughly equal amounts

709
00:36:04,969 --> 00:36:10,879
of THC and CBD this is the way cannabis

710
00:36:07,639 --> 00:36:12,868
used to be before selective breeding for

711
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:16,548
the recreational market made it

712
00:36:12,869 --> 00:36:20,160
type one now this one's too high and my

713
00:36:16,548 --> 00:36:24,088
glutes got a lot of CBD which is good

714
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:27,568
and inflammation and burns the CBD is

715
00:36:24,088 --> 00:36:32,578
good for for epilepsy it's also high in

716
00:36:27,568 --> 00:36:35,880
low which is sort of violet bar down

717
00:36:32,579 --> 00:36:36,778
there so it burns and epilepsy what do

718
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:39,028
they have in common

719
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:40,579
my guess is the need for this type 2

720
00:36:39,028 --> 00:36:44,969
legend

721
00:36:40,579 --> 00:36:49,710
type 3 plants are high CBD and and

722
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:52,980
Lohmann THC this one because it's very

723
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:54,929
high and carry off lean and he has CBD

724
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:59,548
predominantly it would be very good for

725
00:36:54,929 --> 00:37:01,259
plane pain inflammation behind carry

726
00:36:59,548 --> 00:37:04,108
ethylene it's also good to treat

727
00:37:01,259 --> 00:37:07,440
addiction so again these are things that

728
00:37:04,108 --> 00:37:11,719
seem very disparate but have in common

729
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:11,720
the need for these various components

730
00:37:12,889 --> 00:37:19,558
this is another type 3 CBD predominant

731
00:37:16,318 --> 00:37:22,498
um because it's very high in limonene

732
00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:23,999
and low and sedative aspects it should

733
00:37:22,498 --> 00:37:27,629
be very good for a treating depression

734
00:37:23,998 --> 00:37:31,558
and anxiety that's got a fear of them

735
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:34,200
all another type 3 this one I'm really

736
00:37:31,559 --> 00:37:37,710
excited about because it's not only rich

737
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:41,038
in CBD it's got a good amount of CBD v

738
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:43,940
so it should work on generalized

739
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:47,369
seizures and Cedars and partial on the

740
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:48,650
carry Halloween will provide reduction

741
00:37:47,369 --> 00:37:51,870
of before

742
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:54,329
we'll also contribute to it being an

743
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:56,519
anticonvulsant what we call a wide

744
00:37:54,329 --> 00:38:00,619
spectrum into convulsive it should work

745
00:37:56,519 --> 00:38:05,039
in most of the many kinds of seizures

746
00:38:00,619 --> 00:38:07,079
and finally I wanted to show this but we

747
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:10,199
left to right we have a title implant

748
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:12,659
high THC type two in the middle equal

749
00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:15,629
amounts of THC and CBD and type three

750
00:38:12,659 --> 00:38:17,929
predominantly CBD on the right if you

751
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:21,599
look at the terpenoid bars at the bottom

752
00:38:17,929 --> 00:38:24,869
they look the same in each one so then

753
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:26,849
having the ability to compare these in

754
00:38:24,869 --> 00:38:30,569
patients who really tell us a great deal

755
00:38:26,849 --> 00:38:32,969
about what the contributions are of the

756
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:35,400
different components were keeping one

757
00:38:32,969 --> 00:38:38,429
side of the same and we're altering the

758
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:42,360
balance of the cannabinoids so this is

759
00:38:38,429 --> 00:38:45,409
very promising for future clinical use

760
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:48,750
and I hope they haven't exceeded my time

761
00:38:45,409 --> 00:38:51,359
I'm happy to answer questions I know

762
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:52,860
it's your break time and if you need to

763
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:56,048
leave for any reason

764
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:58,179
please do so

765
00:38:56,048 --> 00:38:59,650
hard feelings thank you for your

766
00:38:58,179 --> 00:39:04,050
attention

767
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:20,650
