we know he does great things so he

26
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:18,759
should have the TGA genetics the

27
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:21,039
watermelon and anything else that uh I

28
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:22,400
that comes across my plate I'm glad to

29
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,960
share with Matt cuz I know he's not

30
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,799
going to hoard it I know he's going to

31
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:27,679
share it and even more importantly I

32
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:30,040
know he's going to work with it and

33
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,439

IND hey guys just got to the ferry

77
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,360
terminal here and uh we got about 25

78
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,120
minutes to kill the cars are just

79
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,800
unloading but I think that's actually a

80
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,478
bow and Island fairy they're unloading

81
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:40,560
from so I think we're going to have a

82
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:42,519
little session here straighten this

83
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,038
camera a tiny little bit CU I'm

84
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:45,038
obsessive

85
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:51,280
compulsive there we go all right so I've

86
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:56,399
have brought

87
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:59,918
the product case with the Hitman rig

88
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:02,279
inside the little little baby case

89
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:04,079
really been loving this piece just to

90
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:05,679
keep the plastic bag and the kleenex in

91
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:08,758
there so it absorbs any little bit of

92
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:11,519
bong water that I've uh left over not

93
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:14,280
sure if I even brought any

94
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:15,599
extra water in here so we're going for

95
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:18,599
some dry hits

96
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,639
today dry hits are better than no hits I

97
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:24,360
always

98
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:26,600
say I always say so we got our

99
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:29,879
nail got to have

100
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:32,240
that we got our little creme brle torch

101
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:33,360

102
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,639
different

103
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,680
bubbles so we are going to see Matt from

104
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:41,400

105
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:44,400

106
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:46,239
some great Gardener dry sift look at

108
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,680

109
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:56,240

152
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:10,239
whole time until um I realized the guy

153
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:11,878
in front of me is starting his car and

154
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:16,360
driving onto the

155
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:18,680
ferry that's usually my um my cue to

156
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,720
realize that hey Bal man if you're

157
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,000

158
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:24,319

Matt always has the most incredible I

161
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:29,959
was talking to John about this today and

162
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:31,639
you know obviously it has a lot to do

163
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:33,559
with the resin that you grow when you

164
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:36,158
start sifting the majority of your resin

165
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:39,119
you really see what you're growing you

166
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:41,000
really get to see the resin uncovered uh

167
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,278
isolated and taken from the plant and

168
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,480

this last time and I failed miserably so

291
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:46,919
I figured the only thing to do was to

292
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:52,439
come back and make another

293
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:54,519

420
00:25:08,679 --> 00:25:13,960
different than my other screens this is

421
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:15,480
a 250 Micron and a 180 so it's a bigger

422
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:17,278
size we're going to use the dry sift

423
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:19,240
Wizards trick we're going to put all the

424
00:25:17,278 --> 00:25:22,200
herb gently and do a super light bounce

425
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:24,480
get like 99% pure heads and then you can

426
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:27,558
literally use the the bottom one the 180

427
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,880

430
00:25:33,319 --> 00:25:42,398
is um 180 Micron and you've got a 60

431
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:44,159
Mash lines per inch which is 250 Micron

432
00:25:42,398 --> 00:25:47,079
the smaller the number for lines per

433
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:49,240
inch or mesh the bigger the Micron

434
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:51,678

448
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:35,519

449
00:26:32,919 --> 00:26:37,919
you can see the crystals dude this is

450
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:40,278
and it's super dry beautiful

451
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:41,720
herb these two almost look like

452
00:26:40,278 --> 00:26:45,558
completely separate

453
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:47,960
fenos it does look like a different Bud

454
00:26:45,558 --> 00:26:49,599
hey if it wasn't for if it wasn't for

455
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:51,399
sort of down in here yeah as you get

456
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:53,079
lower you can tell it's exactly the same

457
00:26:51,398 --> 00:26:54,119
TI it must have been close to the light

458
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:56,918
holy

459
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:59,038
Moes D I can only imagine how much dry

460
00:26:56,919 --> 00:27:03,038
sift is inside

461
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:04,879
these bins so and this is a non seated

462
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:07,519
this is seated oh it is seated I can't

463
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:09,480
even see the seated feminized seed

464
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:10,759
beautiful yeah they're in there yeah you

465
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,798
got to crush them up to get them out do

466
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:14,440
you find it's because when all those

467
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:16,440
hair like all these leaves dry and

468
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:19,159
everything right like just prot it

469
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:21,798
totally protects the bud and when you

470
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:26,679
start you start taking off these little

471
00:27:21,798 --> 00:27:29,679
leaves I do it over the bins and get

472
00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:32,399
into just CED it is incredible you can

473
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:35,798
get really close on that too it's a

474
00:27:32,398 --> 00:27:38,558
quite a quality little uh little

475
00:27:35,798 --> 00:27:41,679
camera for showing the quality of uh the

476
00:27:38,558 --> 00:27:43,960
resin it's unbelievable often too often

477
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:47,120
I'm uh working with people's material

478
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:50,558
and you just don't see that yeah the

479
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:51,839
bottom of this producer the bottom will

480
00:27:50,558 --> 00:27:55,678
but you think you think if people are

481
00:27:51,839 --> 00:28:00,079
trimming this wet that all all these

482
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:03,159
crystals a get smashed ruptured oh yeah

483
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:04,319
um all all these leaves and stuff I

484
00:28:03,159 --> 00:28:06,399
don't know how many people out there

485
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:08,398
throw away their Leaf it's sort of a

486
00:28:06,398 --> 00:28:10,879
more of a '90s thing where everybody

487
00:28:08,398 --> 00:28:13,359
just threw away their Leaf the quality

488
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,960
of the resin on that leaf is really no

489
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:16,558
different than the quality of the resin

490
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,319
right inside the butt if you were to

491
00:28:16,558 --> 00:28:22,158

492
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:23,798

would that have come via like NYPD yeah

502
00:28:43,278 --> 00:28:47,839
okay so then that guaranteed that lets

503
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:49,719
me know that because it was uh NYPD that

504
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:51,439
had it um it would have come from

505
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:54,319
breeder Steve it would have been an

506
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:56,200
original shry either a red line a red

507
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:57,798
line Red Line okay cool there were two

508
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:59,759
lines the red line and the yellow line

509
00:28:57,798 --> 00:29:02,639
that used the two afghanis that were

510
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:05,158
used in the creation of shisher and both

511
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:08,240
are exceptional slightly different but

512
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:11,240
still so always it's always been number

513
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:14,519
one if someone makes hash out of it it's

514
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:16,839
it's it's a star it is the first bubble

515
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:18,720
hash I ever made that let me know that

516
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:20,558
there was something special with these

517
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,839
bags that these bags could do something

518
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:24,759
that was special cuz before that I had

519
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:27,278
seen it done a few times and I was very

520
00:29:24,759 --> 00:29:28,798
unimpressed with the wet sort of

521
00:29:27,278 --> 00:29:30,839
substance that came out of the one

522
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:33,158
single the two single bags one work bag

523
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:34,959
and one catch bag and then breeder Steve

524
00:29:33,159 --> 00:29:37,240
brought over it was the yellow line of

525
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:39,440
shishkaberry a pure sherberry and when

526
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:41,880
we made that into water

527
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:44,440
hash it was the first time I was like

528
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:46,600
okay there's something here this is a

529
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:50,240
real thing so so in Spain too the

530
00:29:46,599 --> 00:29:52,199
reaction in Spain for the barber Bud was

531
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,038
oh yeah I was having I was having people

532
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:56,600
I respect come up to me and sort of tap

533
00:29:54,038 --> 00:29:58,359
me on the shoulder and be like hey can I

534
00:29:56,599 --> 00:30:02,158

535
00:29:58,359 --> 00:30:03,839
like nice of course you can of course

536
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:06,360
you were so generous with your dry sip

537
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:07,879
so many I bumped into so many people

538
00:30:06,359 --> 00:30:09,918
they'd be like hey do you have any of

539
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:11,320

I like that's amazing that's awesome it

543
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:22,399

544
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:24,000
different people smoked me up with your

545
00:30:22,398 --> 00:30:26,398
hash in

546
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,558
Barcelona like apart from you like you

547
00:30:26,398 --> 00:30:30,439
weren't even around yeah very generous

548
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:32,440
of you it's nice to give your hash away

549
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:33,640
fun you know it's good to share so I

550
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:35,558
guess next up we're going to lay these

551
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:37,919
screens down and do a little bit of

552
00:30:35,558 --> 00:30:41,200
breaking up this bud so we'll uh let's

553
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:44,000
do it catch up with you guys in a

554
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:46,720
bit be the best seed run was a little

555
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,558
late when I are you serious like best

556
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:52,240
for seeds or best for resin oh it's

557
00:30:49,558 --> 00:30:54,759
great for resin but uh when I fmed it I

558
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,919
it was sort of last minute thing so the

559
00:30:54,759 --> 00:31:00,398
right didn't work as good as it should

560
00:30:56,919 --> 00:31:03,000
have all right well we're back you can

561
00:31:00,398 --> 00:31:07,558
hear us yapping away here um we've got

562
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:10,798
the large 5 foot by 3ft screen setup and

563
00:31:07,558 --> 00:31:13,158
that's going to uh break up some nugget

564
00:31:10,798 --> 00:31:15,519
man does that powder up

565
00:31:13,159 --> 00:31:17,519
amazing holy

566
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:18,798
Christ yeah there's some nice seeds

567
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:21,960
there's some seeds in there for sure

568
00:31:18,798 --> 00:31:23,519
yeah absolutely feminized Barber bud so

569
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:27,000
we're doing the little light trick the

570
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:29,679
quick bounce we're um basically going to

571
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,119
break some nugs up over this quite quite

572
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:32,960
delicately because it's a very large

573
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:35,119
screen you don't want to really rub too

574
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,759
much on top of the screen because it's a

575
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:39,638
larger size we're working with a 250

576
00:31:36,759 --> 00:31:42,079
Micron underneath here we have a 180

577
00:31:39,638 --> 00:31:44,918
Micron and what we do is just the more

578
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:47,278
gentle we are we want to just get the

579
00:31:44,919 --> 00:31:50,159
pure heads so if we can get the pure

580
00:31:47,278 --> 00:31:50,159
heads we're

581
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:59,519
happy crappy bin you need a bin yeah I

582
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:02,320
need a crappy bin be right back all

583
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:04,399
right amazing resin content on these

584
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:05,678
plants like these guys uh are definitely

585
00:32:04,398 --> 00:32:08,439
not messing

586
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:11,000
around it's just

587
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:13,519
beautiful reminiscent of that old school

588
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,519
shishka

589
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:16,839
[Music]

590
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:19,759
Berry so

591
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:22,798
nice it's nice to see you know special

592
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:25,119
genetics stay around but also be worked

593
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:27,240
and bred into into something more

594
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:28,798
special I would gladly help you but

595
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:30,440
without gloves I'm not going to even

596
00:32:28,798 --> 00:32:32,398
attempt it I'll melt so much of this

597
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:34,159
resin onto my uh oh yeah you got some

598
00:32:32,398 --> 00:32:36,158
over

599
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:38,159
there I don't know if there's any in

600
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:40,039
there no I don't think there is I think

601
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:42,039
this is like you I wouldn't even use

602
00:32:40,038 --> 00:32:44,759
plastic gloves for stripping like this

603
00:32:42,038 --> 00:32:46,038
yeah this is really only the heavy duty

604
00:32:44,759 --> 00:32:48,519
I only wear the gloves cuz you'll just

605
00:32:46,038 --> 00:32:51,000
you'll get crazy blisters oh yeah I've

606
00:32:48,519 --> 00:32:53,720
been there I have been there so we're

607
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,798
just going to go through and break them

608
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:59,720
up because I'm I'm I'm destocking like

609
00:32:55,798 --> 00:33:02,480
this because it's a seed run uh uh seeds

610
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:05,600
don't mind if buds are broken up people

611
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:08,679
do so yeah people definitely we can go

612
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:11,319
we can go through it fairly quickly and

613
00:33:08,679 --> 00:33:14,960
my God is this ever just

614
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:18,879
perfect perfect perfect so we let this

615
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:20,440
just hang and dry and dry like it's

616
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:23,679
interesting cuz when you get the

617
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:26,480
opportunity to let things really dry out

618
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:30,080
uh wow you can you can play with it

619
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:33,079
right you can get it so so dry but then

620
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:35,879
you can close the door and just let it

621
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:39,079
sit and it's like you know gets a little

622
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:41,679
mo get that that sort of perfect butd

623
00:33:39,079 --> 00:33:44,000
consistency no you can get too

624
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:45,639
dry you know well most people never find

625
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,359
out when they're just so damn worried of

626
00:33:45,638 --> 00:33:49,359
selling it and getting it off the you

627
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:51,839
know and it's so much herb is just sold

628
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:53,918
wet that there's always extremely high

629
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:57,959
moisture content this has an extremely

630
00:33:53,919 --> 00:34:00,399
low moisture content

631
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:04,120
yet you know some of the stocks can

632
00:34:00,398 --> 00:34:05,239
still Bend yeah so that's definitely a

633
00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:08,759
good

634
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:08,760
sign take that

635
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,480
off the stock is

636
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:21,519
reading man I'm excited to see what's

637
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:23,559
under this screen I got to say yeah so

638
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:25,918
we're going to do this for a

639
00:34:23,559 --> 00:34:28,960
bin every time so you always want to

640
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:30,480
move move your product gently so then

641
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,918
when you're doing it you're always doing

642
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,838
it onto the screen cuz all of a sudden

643
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:35,878
you have a big pile of weed and you're

644
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:37,279
trimming buds onto the top of the weed

645
00:34:35,878 --> 00:34:39,398
those triome heads even though they've

646
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:41,960
fallen off they have to now sort of

647
00:34:39,398 --> 00:34:43,279
navigate yeah Plinko their way down

648
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:45,240
that's why we have a huge screen here

649
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,480
too so you you know if you've got a big

650
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:49,279
screen don't be afraid to use it if

651
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:51,000
you've got multiple people all using

652
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,839
their own this would literally be a

653
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,760
screen for four people you could have

654
00:34:52,838 --> 00:34:56,480
two workers on that side two workers on

655
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:58,640
this side and just working over these

656
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:01,800
screens doing exactly he's doing this is

657
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:04,319
a good chunk of screen to do this work

658
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:06,839
or one worker

659
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:09,320
working yeah serious I'm not really

660
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:12,519
working am I I'm a talker come on I'm

661
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:14,119
here to talk no my work will be lifting

662
00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:16,280
these screens and seeing what's

663
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:19,599
underneath them and then of course

664
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:23,040
dropping that onto the ceramic

665
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:25,680
uh little plate that Dil sent you what

666
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:27,838
do they call that little ceramic insert

667
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:29,639
I think that's what it's called you put

668
00:35:27,838 --> 00:35:32,400
it inside the tie nail or you use it on

669
00:35:29,639 --> 00:35:33,838
top oh no I just use it on top yeah yeah

670
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,000
I did that by accident and that's how

671
00:35:33,838 --> 00:35:37,320
people are using them now they laughed

672
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,559
at me they were like what are you doing

673
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:41,359
with the thing and I'm like it didn't

674
00:35:38,559 --> 00:35:44,279
fit in my tie cuz it's the original

675
00:35:41,358 --> 00:35:46,960
titanium bowls and Nails it fits right

676
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:48,519
in but mine was ground down so that

677
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:51,199
little piece in the middle that was

678
00:35:48,519 --> 00:35:52,838
keeping the screen from oh yeah I wanted

679
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:55,879
them to grind it down and it thickened

680
00:35:52,838 --> 00:35:58,318
the walls anyway it's how that became to

681
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:02,358
be I think it's good for photography too

682
00:35:58,318 --> 00:36:04,599
oh it makes great photos oh my God I put

683
00:36:02,358 --> 00:36:06,559
too much on one the other day and I gave

684
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:08,200
it to a rookie you I don't believe it no

685
00:36:06,559 --> 00:36:10,159
I gave it to one of the one of the the

686
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:13,000
king of putting too much on and he like

687
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:15,199
the guy just like and just like right

688
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,199
down

689
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:20,078
the slowly yeah that's that's where the

690
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:22,440
drop down comes in

691
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:24,280
handy right the that little yeah there's

692
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:26,599
a little piece it's a little glass piece

693
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:28,160
that goes up and then goes down and then

694
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:30,280
points up again and you put your bowl

695
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:31,879
and the D nail down there that way

696
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:33,960
things that drop through don't go into

697
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:35,920
the pipe they sit down in this little

698
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:38,760
chamber at which you could literally

699
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:41,240
just torch later for a

700
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:43,560

that weren't entering you know dedicated

741

their tickets more new people could come

742
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:19,159
because there are at least 25 people

743
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:20,318

769
00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:25,519
do a 10 minute then 1 Hour 1 hour and

770
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:28,078
then we'll do the 24h hour 24 hour well

771
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:31,480
we'll do the 1 hour and then we'll go

772
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:33,079
and uh get the seed out 24 hours when

773
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:36,039
Matt first said that to me I was like

774
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:38,680
this guy is insane that he's spinning

775
00:39:36,039 --> 00:39:40,838
his material for 24 hours he's not

776
00:39:38,679 --> 00:39:43,118
actually insane his herb is just so much

777
00:39:40,838 --> 00:39:45,719
better than most people's herb that his

778
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:47,119
24 hour which you couldn't even run the

779
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:49,279
majority of people's herb you could not

780
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:51,200
run for 24 hours it would be like uh

781
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:53,119
lawn clippings at the end of it but

782
00:39:51,199 --> 00:39:56,279
you've seen what we pull out on his

783
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:58,480
24hour big bag of golden sift that still

784
00:39:56,280 --> 00:40:00,440
slightly sticks to to itself sure it's

785
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:02,599
contaminated it's been spinning for 24

786
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:04,720
hours but the fact that you get the

787
00:40:02,599 --> 00:40:07,880
amount that you get after already doing

788
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:12,039
the 10 and the one hour it blows my mind

789
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:17,680
man like it really does this is

790
00:40:12,039 --> 00:40:20,519
um THC ladened herb unadulterated canabo

791
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:22,559
been collecting them for years well you

792
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:24,880
know you know go through hundreds of

793
00:40:22,559 --> 00:40:27,440
strains to find that one that's just

794
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:29,680
like oh my God it's so different right

795
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:31,358
there there's only a few strains like

796
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:33,759
the sweet skunk is one of those strains

797
00:40:31,358 --> 00:40:36,199
for me the the Warlock is one of those

798
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:38,440
strains for me the Warlock has a unique

799
00:40:36,199 --> 00:40:40,279
smell both of those totally the ha which

800
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:44,039
sort of comes from the old pers and the

801
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:46,760
perss is you know smells are

802
00:40:44,039 --> 00:40:49,318
extraordinary I mean it really is just

803
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:51,880
about a profile you know there's of

804
00:40:49,318 --> 00:40:54,759
course visual things that show us

805
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:57,559
different structures and genetics in the

806
00:40:54,760 --> 00:41:00,400
plants but it's in those profiles the

807
00:40:57,559 --> 00:41:02,279
ratios of cannabinoids versus THC versus

808
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:04,880
the tpin and terpenoids and

809
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:07,160
monoterpenoids and sesquiterpenoids and

810
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:10,200
you can read about all these cool things

811
00:41:07,159 --> 00:41:12,239
uh Google it up this is uh this is the

812
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:14,399
the next the next level of cannabis

813
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:17,639
learning people are not just growing

814
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:19,200
herb uh this is the messenger well you

815
00:41:17,639 --> 00:41:23,199
think because of prohibition right

816
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:26,439
people grew plants for size sure no

817
00:41:23,199 --> 00:41:28,879
smell you know canot smell you know

818
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:31,280
these are sort of before carbon cans and

819
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:34,519
you search for houses with high chimneys

820
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:36,440
and oh yeah or you search for a house

821
00:41:34,519 --> 00:41:38,920
the best house we ever found was on the

822
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:42,358
train tracks and right where the train

823
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:44,680
came around on this property it it shot

824
00:41:42,358 --> 00:41:46,719
it's it gave it a big boost of power and

825
00:41:44,679 --> 00:41:49,358
shot out a huge amount of diesel out the

826
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:51,959
top of the the stack so it was just

827
00:41:49,358 --> 00:41:54,960
perfect for the um for the diesel

828
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:57,920
generator that was also 24/7 pumping out

829
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:59,880
diesel smoke to just have this train

830
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:03,200
doing it like six times a day or

831
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:05,160
something and I remember grower so mad

832
00:42:03,199 --> 00:42:07,399
because you gave him a stinky stinky

833
00:42:05,159 --> 00:42:11,519
strain oh of course my God man that

834
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:14,720
plant is so the [Â __Â ] your problem man

835
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:16,318
it's like oh sorry that's so true here

836
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:17,919
you go and then it was and then it's why

837
00:42:16,318 --> 00:42:20,599
it's probably one of the reasons why

838
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:21,920
only the few seem to have the ability

839
00:42:20,599 --> 00:42:24,880
and it's funny that this would even

840
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:26,720
still be connected you know the Barb has

841
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:29,519
Shish Berry in it that Shish came from

842
00:42:26,719 --> 00:42:32,358
Steve Steve and Matt to me remind me of

843
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:35,400
one another in one sense that they both

844
00:42:32,358 --> 00:42:38,159
recognize quality they both don't just

845
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:39,800
smoke joints they know what full melt

846
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:41,639
resin is they know the grades and the

847
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:43,160
levels and from all the Breeders I've

848
00:42:41,639 --> 00:42:45,920
met over the years the ones that

849
00:42:43,159 --> 00:42:47,879
recognize the qualities of the resin to

850
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:51,400
me seem to be the ones that have better

851
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:54,200
luck in producing strains go figure that

852
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:56,480
produce melty resin for sure you know

853
00:42:54,199 --> 00:42:57,919
you just can't figure that out sming

854
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:01,760
because of the CL and then you get to

855
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:03,920
see you to see that those same smelly

856
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:05,079
plants are the same plants that people

857
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:08,119
in the

858
00:43:05,079 --> 00:43:10,280
clubs are using to feel better right cuz

859
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:12,519
there's something

860
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:16,160
to the the

861
00:43:12,519 --> 00:43:19,480
synergistic smells and flavors that go

862
00:43:16,159 --> 00:43:20,719
along with the high or the pain relief

863
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:23,318
or

864
00:43:20,719 --> 00:43:25,719
the

865
00:43:23,318 --> 00:43:27,800
so oh I just accidentally dropped that

866
00:43:25,719 --> 00:43:30,039
big oops I Did It Again so there well

867
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:33,400
let's do that that's one oh no we're not

868
00:43:30,039 --> 00:43:37,000
done one bin we're not done one bin we

869
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:39,000
didn't empty it out

870
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,400
man all

871
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:44,519
right there you

872
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:48,960
go it's so reminiscent to of that old

873
00:43:44,519 --> 00:43:52,199
school lime bud you know the light

874
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:54,400
colored herb it's

875
00:43:52,199 --> 00:43:55,598
just puts a smile on my face I'm

876
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,400
definitely going to do some macro

877
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:59,079
photography for you guys here get a

878
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:02,280
little bit of

879
00:43:59,079 --> 00:44:04,079
um uh the the resin on the plant I

880
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:05,720
pulled a few buds aside here that I'll

881
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:09,519
shoot for you to show you the quality of

882
00:44:05,719 --> 00:44:11,639
the resin and how intact it is this dry

883
00:44:09,519 --> 00:44:15,519
uh still on the on the plant so how long

884
00:44:11,639 --> 00:44:18,440
did you hang and dry this for two weeks

885
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:21,440
I think three weeks but at least at

886
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:24,679
least two at for a week hung for a week

887
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:28,000
it sat in a bin or it hung for two weeks

888
00:44:24,679 --> 00:44:30,639
uh and then it sat in a bin for a couple

889
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:33,760
days and then uh we open the lid and

890
00:44:30,639 --> 00:44:36,078
just uh and we stuck it in one room that

891
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:38,680
was warm I would suggest also just to uh

892
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:40,800
crisp it up right before we uh the fact

893
00:44:38,679 --> 00:44:43,000
that you're leaving the stock on is is

894
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:45,200
huge that people think that they can do

895
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:48,838
this by taking the buds off the stock

896
00:44:45,199 --> 00:44:51,799
your bud will get way drier so realize

897
00:44:48,838 --> 00:44:54,000
that if you're going to copy him and uh

898
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:56,240
come out with the same results make sure

899
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,719
that you leave your plant on the stick

900
00:44:56,239 --> 00:44:59,519
the stock is super Super Key cuz it

901
00:44:57,719 --> 00:45:01,838
holds moisture just the right amount in

902
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:03,920
the inside the cellulose of the stock

903
00:45:01,838 --> 00:45:07,078
and just hold that perfect amount of

904
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:08,720
moisture so that your buds don't uh

905
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:11,519
don't literally turn to dust cuz as

906
00:45:08,719 --> 00:45:14,838
violent as he's being there's still Bud

907
00:45:11,519 --> 00:45:14,838

908
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:19,159

1035
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:22,838
something the cut is yeah perfect yeah

1036
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:25,039
we just kept it under fluorescence and

1037
00:51:22,838 --> 00:51:26,880
just kept it on the back burner so it

1038

genetics breeding growing and supporting

1044
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:44,640
the community in a way that uh I can

1045

only give uh two thumbs up too so two

1046

thumbs up okay we're back um it's been

1047
00:51:48,119 --> 00:51:52,079
hard getting Matt to not like touch the

1048
00:51:50,159 --> 00:51:54,519
resin on the screen cuz he's so like on

1049
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:56,160
autopilot he wants to card up all the

1050
00:51:54,519 --> 00:51:57,759
resin this is a different uh process

1051
00:51:56,159 --> 00:51:59,440
we're doing we can card that up later so

1052
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:01,480
we're going to take this we're going to

1053
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:04,280
gently put it over

1054
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:06,599
there rotate a my way

1055
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:07,760
yeah put it down gently cuz there's

1056
00:52:06,599 --> 00:52:11,440
obviously

1057
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:13,559
still resin to fall through there yeah

1058
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:16,440
like look at that dude I've never seen

1059
00:52:13,559 --> 00:52:20,119
anything like that that's ridiculous

1060
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:22,358
okay so now we need to lift this yeah

1061
00:52:20,119 --> 00:52:25,960
and put it right

1062
00:52:22,358 --> 00:52:27,039
here this whole thing SW look at this I

1063
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:28,760
just want to look look at that it's

1064
00:52:27,039 --> 00:52:30,759

1066
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:36,559

off that's incredible the quality of

1070
00:52:43,039 --> 00:52:49,159
that so much fell breaking it up yeah so

1071
00:52:46,798 --> 00:52:53,480
let's see uh what managed to fall

1072
00:52:49,159 --> 00:52:53,480
through below that

1073
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:01,559
uh put your end

1074
00:53:03,798 --> 00:53:10,480
down all

1075
00:53:06,159 --> 00:53:16,199
right so this right

1076
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:20,039
here should be very very very very very

1077
00:53:16,199 --> 00:53:22,558
pure another card pure than normal I I

1078
00:53:20,039 --> 00:53:26,239
had you give you one yeah I have some

1079
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:29,240
other harder different ones oh okay yeah

1080
00:53:26,239 --> 00:53:31,879
this looks like it's uh the right

1081
00:53:29,239 --> 00:53:31,879
texture as

1082
00:53:32,358 --> 00:53:37,598
well always doing things on a different

1083
00:53:35,719 --> 00:53:40,239
level with the great

1084
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:42,798
Gardener I card that resin up slower you

1085
00:53:40,239 --> 00:53:45,838
can see just in the corner here how I I

1086
00:53:42,798 --> 00:53:45,838
gummed a little bit of it

1087
00:53:48,449 --> 00:53:51,609
[Applause]

1088
00:53:55,440 --> 00:54:01,679
up beautiful color on this dry sift it's

1089
00:53:58,639 --> 00:54:05,039
absolutely golden I'm suspecting under

1090
00:54:01,679 --> 00:54:08,558
the macro lens it's going to be uh damn

1091
00:54:05,039 --> 00:54:08,558
near pure heads

1092
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:33,838
so that's a nice amount to get for a

1093
00:54:30,519 --> 00:54:33,838
first little

1094
00:54:34,159 --> 00:54:41,838
run quality

1095
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:44,240
looks really high it's uh melts right

1096
00:54:41,838 --> 00:54:46,639
into a liquid just in your fingers I got

1097
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:49,558
just a little piece there and it's

1098
00:54:46,639 --> 00:54:53,199
uh it's gummy and

1099
00:54:49,559 --> 00:54:54,798
melty looks to be I'd say 99% pure heads

1100
00:54:53,199 --> 00:54:57,199
just from the way it's glistening and

1101
00:54:54,798 --> 00:55:00,920
Diamond like but I'll get my macro lens

1102
00:54:57,199 --> 00:55:02,558
out and I'll photograph this and um we

1103
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:03,960
still have one more trick to do to get a

1104
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:06,119
second grade and then I guess really

1105
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:07,880
we're going to get a third grade what's

1106
00:55:06,119 --> 00:55:11,640
left on top of this screen or we could

1107
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:16,079
card it through as well it's uh always a

1108
00:55:11,639 --> 00:55:19,199
pleasure working with the great Gardener

1109
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:22,960
wow yeah look at that quality even

1110
00:55:19,199 --> 00:55:22,960
what's sitting on top here is

1111
00:55:24,239 --> 00:55:29,318
incredible there's like random little

1112
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:32,000
red hairs and then that's it everything

1113
00:55:29,318 --> 00:55:32,000
else is just

1114
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:38,159
gold

1115
00:55:36,039 --> 00:55:39,839
well great to know when you use the

1116
00:55:38,159 --> 00:55:42,798
right genetics and you use the right

1117
00:55:39,838 --> 00:55:44,358
tools that you can get uh some pretty

1118
00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:46,239
great

1119
00:55:44,358 --> 00:55:48,199
results so we'll wait for the great

1120
00:55:46,239 --> 00:55:50,399
Gardener to get back up here we'll show

1121
00:55:48,199 --> 00:55:52,358
them this last little second grade trick

1122
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:56,358
that we're going to

1123
00:55:52,358 --> 00:55:58,598
do just for a quick quick run you know

1124
00:55:56,358 --> 00:56:01,279
look at that even look at this though I

1125
00:55:58,599 --> 00:56:03,599
know that's I bet you that's 99% heads

1126
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:06,000
I'm going to photograph it with my macro

1127
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:07,798
lens but even the quality on this is

1128
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:10,639
unbelievable so you want to do the

1129
00:56:07,798 --> 00:56:12,519
second trick 99% heads we'll do it

1130
00:56:10,639 --> 00:56:15,798
together you going to click it yeah

1131
00:56:12,519 --> 00:56:17,400
we'll give it a one two three I usually

1132
00:56:15,798 --> 00:56:20,639
do one in the middle but I would suggest

1133
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:20,639
we don't all you ready

1134
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:27,760
yeah perfect it almost didn't even move

1135
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:30,760
in the middle I know now so let's bring

1136
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:34,079
this back over to our original pile put

1137
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:37,079
it gently over there holy moly that was

1138

flick this is the flick number

1140
00:56:41,679 --> 00:56:46,639

1143
00:56:50,639 --> 00:56:56,239
sift Micron

1144
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:59,318

00:56:59,798 --> 00:57:05,199
screen look at it move it almost like if

1147

you do it too hard it catches

1148
00:57:05,199 --> 00:57:08,639
there he it's

1149
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:14,670
[Music]

1150
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:19,720
nice it's catching a little bit of the

1151
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:22,720
uh I have a room that uh we're going to

1152
00:57:19,719 --> 00:57:25,519
put a AC unit in I'm going to make like

1153
00:57:22,719 --> 00:57:27,759
a super cold room I think that's a

1154
00:57:25,519 --> 00:57:31,000
pretty darn good idea and I'm going to

1155
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:32,920
make it with these put these in there

1156
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:36,480
somehow we should get a hinge on it or

1157
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:38,480
something that'd be cool hydraulic

1158
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:41,719
hinge

1159
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:44,400
well I'm sure whatever you do with them

1160
00:57:41,719 --> 00:57:48,358
be oh you're going to leave them here oh

1161
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:50,920
yeah dude oh man I brought those for you

1162
00:57:48,358 --> 00:57:52,838
dude last time I brought you bubble bags

1163
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:54,480
this time I felt like for the quality of

1164
00:57:52,838 --> 00:57:56,440
resin that you're producing and stuff I

1165
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:58,240
mean I love the idea that you home make

1166
00:57:56,440 --> 00:58:00,679
your screens and stuff but you need a

1167
00:57:58,239 --> 00:58:03,679
professional version of screens these

1168
00:58:00,679 --> 00:58:05,239
screens are oh they're just so tight

1169
00:58:03,679 --> 00:58:07,000
that's what I'm saying it's a special

1170
00:58:05,239 --> 00:58:09,639
machine ours are

1171
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:12,880
like we can never get it tight but yeah

1172
00:58:09,639 --> 00:58:14,679
the machine the stretch it out it' be

1173
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:18,200
interesting to see the process quality

1174
00:58:14,679 --> 00:58:18,199
from from just a

1175
00:58:20,719 --> 00:58:24,759
flick and I mean it's not like we're

1176
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:26,440
done now we've gotten a first grade over

1177
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:29,200
there a second grade over here here

1178
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:31,559
wherever we decide to card this up is a

1179
00:58:29,199 --> 00:58:34,679
third grade and I would suspect whatever

1180
00:58:31,559 --> 00:58:37,000
falls through will once again be another

1181
00:58:34,679 --> 00:58:40,679
at what point does it stop melting yeah

1182
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:43,119
exactly with a barber butt never no

1183
00:58:40,679 --> 00:58:45,199
exactly and then you know that's why you

1184
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:47,039
always want to double stack the screens

1185
00:58:45,199 --> 00:58:49,558
cuz it'll it'll collect this this is

1186
00:58:47,039 --> 00:58:51,799
what you would have collected like on

1187
00:58:49,559 --> 00:58:53,640
here like it's almost like you know but

1188
00:58:51,798 --> 00:58:55,280
you managed to pull these little like a

1189
00:58:53,639 --> 00:58:58,318
couple of grams of heads out on either

1190
00:58:55,280 --> 00:59:01,319
pile you pull out it's almost like you

1191
00:58:58,318 --> 00:59:04,558
further refined you don't have to

1192
00:59:01,318 --> 00:59:06,880
clean it doesn't have to this has to be

1193
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:08,559
cleaned but now you can literally get

1194
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:11,000
like quality of resin like what I was

1195
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:13,200
cleaning for you with just like a single

1196
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:15,119
bounce without the secret without the

1197
00:59:13,199 --> 00:59:18,199
secret it's a different secret secret

1198
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:19,640
Sam secret recipe or secret technique

1199
00:59:18,199 --> 00:59:22,078
stays a

1200
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:24,440
secret well I mean until he allow still

1201
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:27,039
make it yeah well caring's allowed us to

1202
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:29,400
do that um this allows us to do that and

1203
00:59:27,039 --> 00:59:31,640
of course you know Sam's technique still

1204
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:33,680
will always have its place cuz you know

1205
00:59:31,639 --> 00:59:36,239
when guys have like large amounts of it

1206
00:59:33,679 --> 00:59:37,798
that they want cleaned uh that's it I

1207
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:40,639
was just had a conversation about sort

1208
00:59:37,798 --> 00:59:43,119
of dry sift and getting dry sift to the

1209
00:59:40,639 --> 00:59:44,920
point where it's like this and then

1210
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:46,519
they're saying like how much is that

1211
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:49,200
worth and you're

1212
00:59:46,519 --> 00:59:52,440
like you know what are you comparing it

1213
00:59:49,199 --> 00:59:56,038
to are you comparing it to the 20% that

1214
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:59,000
the 20 25% that the BHO guys are getting

1215
00:59:56,039 --> 01:00:00,960
or the 10 to 15% that the ice guys are

1216
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:03,838
doing when you get to this stuff yeah

1217
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:07,838
and you're pulling out like a 1% it's

1218
01:00:03,838 --> 01:00:12,119
one like 1% pulling 1% out of all the SI

1219
01:00:07,838 --> 01:00:14,920
to put a value on it is really where

1220
01:00:12,119 --> 01:00:17,838
prohibition comes into play because

1221
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:21,798
because of prohibition you can't grow

1222
01:00:17,838 --> 01:00:24,599
enough of it to make the true quality

1223
01:00:21,798 --> 01:00:26,639
medicine that is deserved like this is

1224
01:00:24,599 --> 01:00:28,760
the stuff people should be smok of

1225
01:00:26,639 --> 01:00:31,239
course not the plants well the plants it

1226
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:32,480
has their place well the plants bring us

1227
01:00:31,239 --> 01:00:34,159
to the resin you know and they're

1228
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:36,719
definitely like I would never want to

1229
01:00:34,159 --> 01:00:39,279
take away whole plant medicine from

1230
01:00:36,719 --> 01:00:41,598
anyone but I would hope that anyone

1231
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:46,280
would never try to keep you

1232
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:48,960
know to have this on a daily available

1233
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:50,519
basis would take an enormous amount of

1234
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:52,760
cannabis well did you just see the

1235
01:00:50,519 --> 01:00:54,480
amount of cannabis we used to break up

1236
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:56,599
over that screen I'm sure many of you

1237
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:58,240
were like oh my God

1238
01:00:56,599 --> 01:01:00,480
and you know it's not like we've wasted

1239
01:00:58,239 --> 01:01:03,118
it there's still a ton of resin still on

1240
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:05,079
that bud still on the screens but when

1241
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:06,400
you break it down to the small pile of

1242
01:01:05,079 --> 01:01:10,440
the pure

1243
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:13,639
heads it is beyond rare it's it's the

1244
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:15,200
Holy Grail let's go try the seconds yeah

1245
01:01:13,639 --> 01:01:17,199
absolutely you want to lift up and bring

1246
01:01:15,199 --> 01:01:18,879
the First with us as well of course I

1247
01:01:17,199 --> 01:01:21,000
mean I can't just you can't just grab

1248
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:22,920
the seconds put

1249
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:27,000
this good

1250
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:28,358
call we're going to go back yeah

1251
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:30,960
you could probably get away with

1252
01:01:28,358 --> 01:01:34,279
flicking it multiple times because you

1253
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:37,199
have so much resin on there and it's

1254
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:40,720
yeah you can tell this is a different

1255
01:01:37,199 --> 01:01:43,759
grade yeah oh for sure for sure you know

1256
01:01:40,719 --> 01:01:45,919
what I'm saying it's a tinge of green

1257
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:47,319
that we're not getting here now it's not

1258
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:49,720
that this is contaminated they're

1259
01:01:47,318 --> 01:01:49,719
different

1260
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:56,240
heads you know which definitely makes

1261
01:01:52,159 --> 01:01:56,239
them a little less uh

1262
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:09,240
picks up nice off of the uh poly

1263
01:02:04,039 --> 01:02:09,240
head nice fresh poly fresh

1264
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:19,559
poly got a little snake ready for the

1265
01:02:16,278 --> 01:02:22,719
Dil Ren like this you can put it on the

1266
01:02:19,559 --> 01:02:25,240
card and leave it for all of a

1267
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:27,199
minute and it gums up and it'll gum up

1268
01:02:25,239 --> 01:02:29,639
and harden up and make it a lot safer

1269
01:02:27,199 --> 01:02:31,078
for us to move that from here to

1270
01:02:29,639 --> 01:02:34,639
downstairs where we're going to go hit

1271
01:02:31,079 --> 01:02:36,400
that D now because after all that time

1272
01:02:34,639 --> 01:02:38,598
of growing beautiful cannabis and

1273
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:40,519
hanging it and putting it in the drum

1274
01:02:38,599 --> 01:02:42,278
the bins and flipping it and then

1275
01:02:40,519 --> 01:02:44,358
bringing it over to the screen and deep

1276
01:02:42,278 --> 01:02:48,599
stalking it and collecting the resin the

1277
01:02:44,358 --> 01:02:52,318
way we collected it to drop it is an ABS

1278
01:02:48,599 --> 01:02:55,838
[Â __Â ] loot no go you can't you can't

1279
01:02:52,318 --> 01:02:57,719
do that that's like uh I don't know

1280
01:02:55,838 --> 01:02:59,440
that's a faux paaw Beyond faux paw that

1281
01:02:57,719 --> 01:03:01,959
was amazing you just dropped a tiny

1282
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:03,880
little drop of it and it exploded when

1283
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:05,798
it landed as we're talking about

1284
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:08,039
dropping it but hey you dropped it where

1285
01:03:05,798 --> 01:03:09,639
you're supposed to drop it t yeah that's

1286
01:03:08,039 --> 01:03:12,319
listen dropping it on the table is one

1287
01:03:09,639 --> 01:03:15,239
thing dropping it on the wood stairs

1288

that's a nogo so uh yeah let's head

1289
