7
00:00:57,878 --> 00:01:03,718
attacks me says thing God we thought she

8
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:03,718
was

9
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:12,118
lesan she story nothing wrong with

10
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:16,000
that not inappropriate but I realized

11
00:01:12,118 --> 00:01:16,000
immediately this was a man with no

12
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,880
filter and a unique

13
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:24,239
individual and over the

14
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:27,319
years I

15
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:29,118
learned how to become friends with him

16
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:30,798
and to appreciate him and his very

17
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:34,000
strange

18
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:37,399
and sometimes inappropriate as of

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,759
humor but he was uh he was always very

20
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:39,759
good to

21
00:01:47,629 --> 00:01:50,738
[Music]

22
00:01:54,438 --> 00:02:00,758
me for a

23
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:04,159
second so know 25 years a long time

24
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:06,718
right so years passed by but I remember

25
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,239
really nice memories and when when M and

26
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:10,399
I didn't have a lot of money she go

27
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,000
let's go over to my mom and dad's to

28
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:15,919
bite

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:20,000
ribs or sushi or whatever we like B

30
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:24,039
ourselves over and and he would

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,719
always say all by you fly that's right

32
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:31,519
and I would fly off and go get the ribs

33
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:33,759
and come back and those are good days

34
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:36,000
and I remember going to the

35
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:37,439
greenhouse and uh he was very proud of

36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,959
his

37
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:44,439
work but we loved the beans and the

38
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:46,719
tomatoes and the corn we grow beans and

39
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:49,560
tomatoes and corn and we would just love

40
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:51,000
it you know and then of course you know

41
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,000
all the Christmases all all the

42
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
birthdays he was always very generous

43
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,840
and uh and then C was born

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,959
2005 and he was a really great grand

45
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:04,680
father

46
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:06,120
Surge and she was born on Christmas Day

47
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,040
and that made Christmases even more

48
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,519
special the only problem was that he

49
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:13,959
would buy too many

50
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:17,080
presents and I'm not kidding serious I

51
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:19,439
we had to talk to him about it once the

52
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,959
Dave it's cool it's

53
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:23,439
great but you know we don't have space

54
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:27,039
for all this

55
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:29,239

so um I'm going to start off with a

86
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,439
little story that I want to

87
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:26,759
share um some of you know that I'm

88
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:28,639
planning on studying film next year and

89
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:32,000
I actually made my first movie with my

90
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:34,519
grandfather when I was 7even and it was

91
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,360
called draw a picture and it was a 3

92
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:41,240
minute movie of me coming home from

93
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:43,720
school and drawing a picture of my day

94
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:46,000
and um he was the

95
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:49,319
cameraman and when we watched back the

96
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,279
videos to edit them together all I could

97
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:54,039
hear was his Extremely Loud breathing

98
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:56,599
straight into the

99
00:05:54,038 --> 00:05:58,360
microphone that was the day that my

100
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:01,639
grandfather taught me the importance of

101
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,639
adding music to film

102
00:06:02,038 --> 00:06:07,240
he taught me a lot of other important

103
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:09,680
things um that I will remember

104
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:12,120
forever he taught me that one could

105
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:16,519
never receive too many Christmas

106
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:19,079
gifts and um that or watch too many

107
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:21,399
movies and he taught me that having fun

108
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:23,680
is more important than being an

109
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:26,359
adult and and that it's never the wrong

110
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,560
time to make a joke and it's never too

111
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:31,038
cold to wear

112
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:34,160
flipflops even with socks on

113
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:35,759
he taught me that teachers can be wrong

114
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:39,319
and uh that you have to drink at least

115
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,319
one can of Coca-Cola every

116
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:46,719
day he he also taught me how to build

117
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:49,560
the biggest Lego Cities and um taught me

118
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,840
the funniest ways to play with cats and

119
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:54,280
the best way to make French toast

120
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:57,198
obviously with an entire bottle of

121
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:59,799
cinnamon um to him the most important

122
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,800
lesson that he wanted to share was to

123
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:04,199
never get

124
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:06,240
old which is a scary one because you

125
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:07,680
know that growing up and getting old is

126
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,280
inevitable for

127
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,319
everybody and um unfortunately the last

128
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:13,519
thing he taught me is that grandparents

129
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,560
aren't

130
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:18,478
Immortal and I used to think he was

131
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:21,839
Immortal I thought that we had plenty of

132
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:25,519
time to travel together and go to

133
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:28,519
restaurants and sit in our lazy boys and

134
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:31,719
watch movies drinking Cokes all

135
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:35,598
day whenever we used to say goodbye we

136
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:37,479
wouldn't hug we would kiss our fingers

137
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:39,079
and touch them

138
00:07:37,478 --> 00:07:41,758
together

139
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:43,878
Opa please know that I cherish all the

140
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,960
time we had together even though it

141
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:51,000
seemed short and I'll keep your lessons

142
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:51,000
with me forever I love

arly the most influential cus breeder in

things to say that every CIS breeder

operating over the last 40 years owe him

a depth of

187

gratitude heardman Sam as a young boy

188
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:29,360
here in Amsterdam I'm a local time board

189
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:31,559
in Amsterdam never imagining that I'm

190
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,039
might someday call him a friend it was

191
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:35,159
only after becoming a successful

192
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:37,679
academist entrepreneur and historian

193
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:40,600
myself that I eventually built up the

194
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:42,159
courage to reach out to him knowing he

195
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,759
lived here and answer them I asked our

196
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:46,958
mutual friend Valerie Coral to make an

197
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:49,200
introduction about four years ago I

198
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:51,199
initiated email conversation with him

199
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,399
and began sending in pictures of some of

200
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,839
the items I was collecting for my world

201
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:57,360
of canist Museum project being as

202
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,279
private as he was he didn't want to

203
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,600
speak to me at first but eventually he

204
00:11:00,278 --> 00:11:05,000
began to reply and after many months he

205
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:07,639
finally visited me at his home for a

206
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,120
sash after overcoming his initial

207
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:11,320
hesitation I felt like we made a

208
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,240
connection and hit it off I later

209
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:15,680
invited him to my place to show him my

210
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:17,480
collection of Canabis arts and artifacts

211
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:19,078
I started making an effort to spend more

212
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:21,720
time with him and before long I figured

213
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:24,239
out the trick I realized that it took

214
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:27,320
him that if I took him out for a nice

215
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:31,480
lunch or dinner I could get him to talk

216
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:33,399
so uh only off the records of course I

217
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,959
was uh always trying to convince him to

218
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:37,278
let us interview in for the world of

219
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:39,239
canist but he would never agree as I'm

220
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:41,360
sure you all know he was not very father

221
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,360
of

222
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:47,838
J in fact one of my Fest memories with

223
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,759
Dave was in the time that I convinced

224
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:52,200
him to have dinner with me and and the

225
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:54,559
world of cist partner Bobby black who as

226
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:57,278
many of you know for high times for over

227
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:59,879
20 years Bobby sensing his regards by

228
00:11:57,278 --> 00:12:01,838
the way he refused to at first but

229
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:04,000
ultimately thanks to thanks to the

230
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:06,920
promise of a mission and star meal in

231
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,480
the Ura and and by sincere personal

232
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:12,958
insurances he finally agreed to

233
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:15,039
come Char characteristically arriving at

234
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:18,119
the upskill restaurant wearing flick

235
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:21,000
flops and shirt with canab sleeves

236
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,839
on knowing Bobby was a journalist he was

237
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,600
highly regarded at first but as the

238
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:26,160
evening went on and he realized Bobby

239
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,639
was the thre he opened up and began

240
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:31,439
sharing stories again off the record of

241
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,839
course if we weren't if it wer for death

242
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,560
that dinner Bobby would never had the

243
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:36,959
opportunity know so I'm happy I could

244
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:39,638
make that happen over the past several

245
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:42,799
years I was fortunity to share much

246
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:44,959
meals with da as well as much at his

247
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:46,519
house where I would sit and smoke with

248
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:49,838
him discussing our Collections and

249
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:51,720
listening to many stories or RS the most

250
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:54,079
in to the most in academ this world he

251
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:56,278
was controversial and then metic icon

252
00:12:54,078 --> 00:12:58,838
who shot the spotlight forbade photos of

253
00:12:56,278 --> 00:13:01,519
himself to be made public and operated

254
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:03,920

255
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:07,560

SES Pudo Mr Jingles and of

257
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:11,838
course but of those who were lucky

258
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,639
enough to be let in who actually knew

259

293
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:30,958

but

296
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:42,720
D made the most amazing hash I

297
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:45,480
have I mean when I would smoke his hash

298
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,480
I would go into

299
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:53,160
another and one time he BR me to his

300
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:56,720
Greenhouse showed me the most amazing

301
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:59,159
plant but for about at least 10 years I

302
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:02,959
lived with a stock

303
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:06,439
this stock that was that this W um

304
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:10,958
drive and I lived with it in my house

305
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:12,880
I like a magic

306
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:16,599
I

307
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:20,240
and many times I P that stock and I go I

308
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:22,120
Che go this this what my pants are made

309
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:27,560
out of is made out of this

310
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:29,440
stock and this made can too

311
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:33,198
but I

312
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:34,399
that St and then one day Doug called me

313
00:16:33,198 --> 00:16:38,120
and

314
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:41,519
said can I possibly get that

315
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:45,159
stock I didn't like that

316
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:48,039
but I already like put so much energy in

317
00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:51,838
prayer into that stock that stock

318
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:54,838
influenced me so much showed me what

319
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:56,319
this stuff could be what the raw

320
00:16:54,839 --> 00:17:00,440
material

321
00:16:56,318 --> 00:17:03,278
was and so I gave back to

322
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:06,160
dog and on the way here today I found

323
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:09,078
out where that stock lives

324
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,880
now it was with that

325
00:17:09,078 --> 00:17:14,119
guy

326
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:16,400
and that made me feel so good that Trier

327
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:19,078
has that St that I put energy into for

328
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:21,439
10 years it was kind of that wasn't

329
00:17:19,078 --> 00:17:23,038
planned that was going to just magical

330
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:26,240
because everything

331
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:26,240
around a

332
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:35,080
from very mag and one time I went to a

333
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:38,520
birthday party at of Adams

334
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:43,359

337
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:56,960

338
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:59,840
says he has a ball in his head

so but an hour later I went back home my

343
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,359
three-year-old granddaughter she was

344
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:21,159
there because she's lived in my house

345
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:21,158
over and she

346
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:27,918

347
00:18:24,558 --> 00:18:29,879
there it hadn't hit me yet it was just

348
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:31,880

349
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:34,600
and I said The Three Little Pigs I it

350
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:36,280

351
00:18:34,599 --> 00:18:38,558

353
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:41,759
straw and

354
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:49,080

420
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:33,080
order just happened because someone was

421
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:35,480
talking about the hempstock number one

422
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:37,720
which actually now is with the then okay

423
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:41,839
so I'll explain how it came how I came

424
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:44,600
here um and I came here in about 92 and

425
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:44,599
we started the

426
00:22:46,759 --> 00:22:53,240
C it's all good dog good bro you

427
00:22:56,599 --> 00:23:01,959
you anyways um

428
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:05,520
so he got us all started in the business

429
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:07,759
and um taught us about breeding and I

430
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:10,639
I'll go to a funny story just because uh

431
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:14,158
I got to get to that place and

432
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:15,960
um uh like when we first moved here we

433
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,120
were really young we started the CIA

434
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:20,240
which was like um hem clothing and

435
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:23,759
things which all came from you know the

436
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:26,120
ideas came from uh David and uh got us

437
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:28,960
into the seed business which it's like

438
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:32,519
everyone here I see I know through

439
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:35,079
this and um like Julian how I got into

440
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:39,400
business

441
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:44,079
Sor I didn't think I'd do this anyways

442
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:45,440
so um you know like he taught um about

443
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:47,759
breeding and everything about the

444
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:49,000
quality and it's like uh when we first

445
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:51,720
came it was like if you asked like

446
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,359
someone that was Dutch in the business

447
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:56,798
they just said oh it's the best and you

448
00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:59,319
say you know and you're like why he like

449
00:23:56,798 --> 00:24:01,119
because it's super you you know so Sam

450
00:23:59,319 --> 00:24:03,399
had skunk and then everyone else had

451
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:06,558
super skunk and

452
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:10,038
you're saying super that's

453
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:11,678
all um so but what he what he taught us

454
00:24:10,038 --> 00:24:14,119
you know we were really young you know

455
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:17,840
when we started the business and de and

456
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:19,519
Sam and Rob Clark were older you know so

457
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:22,038
they really uh taught us how to do

458
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:24,400
things right I mean we gave our like say

459
00:24:22,038 --> 00:24:27,679
sage and MK Ultra to him he would

460
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:29,720
quarantine it and um then he would make

461
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:31,840
the seeds so then those seeds just

462
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:34,399
spread out it wasn't just me it was most

463
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:36,158
of the Dutch companies at the time uh he

464
00:24:34,398 --> 00:24:39,319
was making them so that's why everything

465
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:41,960
has skunk in it and that's how we're you

466
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:43,639
know very connected uh not just from him

467
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:46,640
but through the genetics and the breing

468
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:49,399
that he was doing so this is Julian and

469
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:52,960
um he came to the Canabis cup once and

470
00:24:49,398 --> 00:24:55,278
had this amazing amazing Sage so I knew

471
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:57,159
that that was uh from Sam because when

472
00:24:55,278 --> 00:24:59,119
we had regular seeds he was making it

473
00:24:57,159 --> 00:25:01,600
with the skunk number one

474
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:04,319
so then uh I brought Julian into the

475
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:07,558
business he's French so I called it lost

476
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:10,240
Ag and that's just kind of how we all

477
00:25:07,558 --> 00:25:12,879
are interconnected um and it's like he's

478
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:15,720
the first seed and then it goes out you

479
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:19,399
know from us to everyone else in the

480
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:21,120
Canada's World um so

481
00:25:19,398 --> 00:25:25,759
yeah

482
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:29,000
sorry and you got any of that stage SM

483
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:32,158
um no actually Julian he didn't bring

484
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:37,679
any up he just flew up from uh from

485
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:37,679
Barcelona and um yeah and his

486
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:42,678
daughter gave me the first the

487
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:53,640
first so everything is kind of like from

488
00:25:50,398 --> 00:25:55,599
that seed of Sam David was just went out

489
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:58,480
and it's still out there in the canas

490
00:25:55,599 --> 00:26:00,719
community um and so about three years

491
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:04,399
ago I was looking through my fridges and

492
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:08,120
I found um uh some old seeds that I got

493
00:26:04,398 --> 00:26:11,119
from him I was um later on I was like

494
00:26:08,119 --> 00:26:13,439
buying bulk of his skunk and the ones

495
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:15,839
and I found two strains sitting there

496
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:19,038
for like I think they're from the mate

497
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:21,519
90s and I selected uh like 10 of them

498
00:26:19,038 --> 00:26:23,960
and I did germination test on them and

499
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:25,759

01:20:55,719 --> 01:21:00,560

754
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:04,359

01:21:06,439 --> 01:21:10,678
double dipping I've already spoken in

758
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:13,119
California so I'm going to try to find

759
01:21:10,679 --> 01:21:16,239
something different to

760
01:21:13,119 --> 01:21:18,000
say I've been thinking a lot about uh

761
01:21:16,238 --> 01:21:21,000
David over the

762
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:23,039
last month and a half and trying to kind

763
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:26,000
of make sense

764
01:21:23,039 --> 01:21:28,479
of just everything and losing him and

765
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:32,119
looking back at his life and trying

766
01:21:28,479 --> 01:21:34,839
to you know just make sense of things

767
01:21:32,119 --> 01:21:36,719
and I keep coming back to this thing

768
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:38,880
that there was people that understood

769
01:21:36,719 --> 01:21:41,600
David and there was people that just did

770
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:44,600
not understand David at all I saw

771
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:48,440
someone right online that they said that

772
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:51,480
David was a a car wreck with

773
01:21:48,439 --> 01:21:52,919
credentials and I you know I thought to

774
01:21:51,479 --> 01:21:54,238
myself I couldn't be farther from the

775
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:57,560
truth this was clearly something that

776
01:21:54,238 --> 01:21:59,959
didn't understand who David was you know

777
01:21:57,560 --> 01:22:01,920
if if if you were a car wrecker an

778
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:03,359
accidental spilling of pain it would

779
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:06,000
have been the Mona

780
01:22:03,359 --> 01:22:09,079
Lisa um and that kind of art and beauty

781
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:12,600
and accomplishment just doesn't happen

782
01:22:09,079 --> 01:22:15,639
freely or without intention and I think

783
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:19,520
that you know if you gave life skill to

784
01:22:15,639 --> 01:22:22,840
people on a scale of 1 to 10 David was

785
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:24,719
aain like he was so far intelligent and

786
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:27,600
accomplished beyond what people really

787
01:22:24,719 --> 01:22:31,399
understood that he was and he wore this

788
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:34,840
kind of HIIT dog costume as a

789
01:22:31,399 --> 01:22:36,359
cloak um in fact once he was you know

790
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:39,440
when he was in high school the principal

791
01:22:36,359 --> 01:22:41,319
wanted him to cut his hair and his

792
01:22:39,439 --> 01:22:42,719
choice was to you know cut his hair and

793
01:22:41,319 --> 01:22:45,599
comply with the dress code or not

794
01:22:42,719 --> 01:22:48,679
graduate so David decided not to

795
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:52,120
graduate um because he wanted to live

796
01:22:48,679 --> 01:22:54,119
life on his own terms and like I said

797
01:22:52,119 --> 01:22:58,319
last time David found a way in life to

798
01:22:54,119 --> 01:23:00,519
turn turn all the NOS in life into yeses

799
01:22:58,319 --> 01:23:03,079
he he wouldn't he wouldn't accept that

800
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:05,880
you couldn't do something and so he

801
01:23:03,079 --> 01:23:08,880
always found a way to make that happen

802
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:11,560
be getting a license in Holland or you

803
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:13,239
know finally achieving working with a

804
01:23:11,560 --> 01:23:15,159
pharmaceutical company to develop this

805
01:23:13,238 --> 01:23:19,319
medicine that he experienced himself and

806
01:23:15,158 --> 01:23:23,039
he knew that had this this therapeutic

807
01:23:19,319 --> 01:23:26,000
potential and

808
01:23:23,039 --> 01:23:27,479
um you know like one example is these

809
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:30,719
you know these soaps that are here

810
01:23:27,479 --> 01:23:33,198
people can come and take a soap or a

811
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:34,960
shampoo they were made with skunk one

812
01:23:33,198 --> 01:23:36,799
ham seed oil that David produced in

813
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:40,800
Hungary he he

814
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:43,360
had the head of the Hungarian research

815
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:44,719
world who was responsible for you know

816
01:23:43,359 --> 01:23:46,839
the police would hire him to come when

817
01:23:44,719 --> 01:23:48,880
there was a bus they'd hire him to come

818
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:52,039
and say this Farm was growing hemp

819
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:55,639
cannabis or drug cannabis and David had

820
01:23:52,039 --> 01:23:58,079
him produce his drug cul car by the

821
01:23:55,639 --> 01:24:00,760
multi-ton load in

822
01:23:58,079 --> 01:24:03,359
Hungary um and and David used to say

823
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:06,280
there is two types of cannabis breeders

824
01:24:03,359 --> 01:24:09,359
those that need a forklift to move the

825
01:24:06,279 --> 01:24:11,679
Harvest and those that don't and and

826
01:24:09,359 --> 01:24:15,519
David truly was the only one in the

827
01:24:11,679 --> 01:24:17,920
former group right and that level of

828
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:18,639
success and achievement that he did in

829
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:21,880
our

830
01:24:18,639 --> 01:24:24,800
industry was so unique it was

831
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:26,639
so I think it was quite resenting by a

832
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:29,480
lot of the people in the industry that

833
01:24:26,639 --> 01:24:31,279
they figured out the path how to do the

834
01:24:29,479 --> 01:24:32,279
things how to get the license how to do

835
01:24:31,279 --> 01:24:35,519
the

836
01:24:32,279 --> 01:24:38,439
work and

837
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:41,400
um yeah how to summarize that

838
01:24:38,439 --> 01:24:44,118
all you do just just to say that you

839
01:24:41,399 --> 01:24:46,719
know David he he I think that the people

840
01:24:44,118 --> 01:24:49,238
that didn't understand him they were

841
01:24:46,719 --> 01:24:52,359
fooled by the hippie dog costum and they

842
01:24:49,238 --> 01:24:55,559
didn't realize what he had going on in

843
01:24:52,359 --> 01:24:56,639
his mind and his game plan and his view

844
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:58,360
of

845
01:24:56,639 --> 01:25:02,920
life

846
01:24:58,359 --> 01:25:05,279
um I watched those photos and you know

847
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:07,199
all I see is him having fun and like I

848
01:25:05,279 --> 01:25:09,158
said in California you know David's

849
01:25:07,198 --> 01:25:12,439
really philosophy of life it

850
01:25:09,158 --> 01:25:16,079
was as long as he got up every day and

851
01:25:12,439 --> 01:25:17,678
had fun and caused a little bit of havoc

852
01:25:16,079 --> 01:25:20,479
and learned or taught something new

853
01:25:17,679 --> 01:25:22,960
about cannabis then he was

854
01:25:20,479 --> 01:25:25,839
satisfied and I think that that's a

855
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:27,319
really a beautiful way to live and um

856
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:31,770
yeah he's that's that's why he's

857
01:25:27,319 --> 01:25:37,000
inspired to me so anyhow God bless

858
01:25:31,770 --> 01:25:41,000

howdy all right and um you

901
01:27:55,639 --> 01:28:01,000
know he was a farmer you guys you know

902
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:04,360
he I would ask him when did you get up

903
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:06,560
oh 500 a.m. six a why do you get up so

904
01:28:04,359 --> 01:28:09,799
early I would ask him he would say well

905
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:12,960
because I consider myself a farmer and

906
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:14,400
no [ __ ] he'd get up that early and I

907
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:17,079
think that's what he admired about me

908
01:28:14,399 --> 01:28:19,920
and now I have cattle for the past 5

909
01:28:17,079 --> 01:28:24,639
years I've been working very hard on my

910
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:28,319
farm David saw this and he saw

911
01:28:24,639 --> 01:28:30,400
and knew what hard work can do for you

912
01:28:28,319 --> 01:28:33,079
uh the environment that I live in is is

913
01:28:30,399 --> 01:28:35,079
animals you guys but I I give a lot of

914
01:28:33,079 --> 01:28:36,639
respect to my animals and I speak to my

915
01:28:35,079 --> 01:28:39,840
animals just like as if they were my

916
01:28:36,639 --> 01:28:43,880
friends or people okay and um David

917
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:47,800
liked that he admired that and he he he

918
01:28:43,880 --> 01:28:50,960
um kind of liked to to see this

919
01:28:47,800 --> 01:28:53,679
environment as he started slowing down a

920
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:56,319
bit and couldn't walk as much I felt

921
01:28:53,679 --> 01:28:58,600
like if I was his legs a little bit

922
01:28:56,319 --> 01:29:02,079
showing them my artch choke fields that

923
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:06,480
I was growing my orange Orchards my

924
01:29:02,079 --> 01:29:09,238
cannabis of course cannabis first and I

925
01:29:06,479 --> 01:29:12,039
mean let's face it you know that's that

926
01:29:09,238 --> 01:29:16,439
was the one thing that bam and and

927
01:29:12,039 --> 01:29:20,920
Marcus helped many of us connect with

928
01:29:16,439 --> 01:29:23,319
him from meeting him to to having um

929
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:26,239
celebrations and things like that and

930
01:29:23,319 --> 01:29:29,279
and that was that was something that

931
01:29:26,238 --> 01:29:33,000
that David was always um happy and proud

932
01:29:29,279 --> 01:29:35,759
of of of certain people that um did

933
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:37,960
things in his life for him you know now

934
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:39,320
I want to tell you that that there's a

935
01:29:37,960 --> 01:29:41,560
way that I think that we can kind of

936
01:29:39,319 --> 01:29:43,920
transform this kind of sadness that we

937
01:29:41,560 --> 01:29:47,199
feel when we think about them and it

938
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:50,480
happened to me you know I'm I don't have

939
01:29:47,198 --> 01:29:52,839
a lot of cookie thoughts and that but I

940
01:29:50,479 --> 01:29:54,799
don't really know how to explain it

941
01:29:52,840 --> 01:29:56,639
first there was

942
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:58,679
time when I contacted him just before

943
01:29:56,639 --> 01:30:00,560
his passing and we had a very long

944
01:29:58,679 --> 01:30:02,480
discussion he was very positive very

945
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:06,400
upbeat I can tell you that the day

946
01:30:02,479 --> 01:30:11,479
before that was passing and the day of

947
01:30:06,399 --> 01:30:12,839
and and and which was like wild and it's

948
01:30:11,479 --> 01:30:16,238
hit us so hard because we have no

949
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:19,639
warning like car accident no warning

950
01:30:16,238 --> 01:30:21,519
nothing just bam and they that now so

951
01:30:19,639 --> 01:30:24,118
how do we process this how do we deal

952
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:27,639
with it and how do we change that memory

953
01:30:24,118 --> 01:30:30,198
into something Grand something and and

954
01:30:27,639 --> 01:30:33,039
it's happened to me a little quicker

955
01:30:30,198 --> 01:30:34,799
okay it's I still get emotional but I

956
01:30:33,039 --> 01:30:37,800
was working very hard getting Forge for

957
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:42,039
the cows crying actually thinking of

958
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:45,039
David and and a double rainbow

959
01:30:42,039 --> 01:30:46,519
appeared now when this happens to you I

960
01:30:45,039 --> 01:30:48,079
mean imagine you got some tears

961
01:30:46,520 --> 01:30:50,679
streaming you look up you see this

962
01:30:48,079 --> 01:30:53,600
rainbow my God that's I that's what I

963
01:30:50,679 --> 01:30:56,239
needed I really needed it and I I

964
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:58,159
thought well that's that's crazy you

965
01:30:56,238 --> 01:31:01,559
know it can't happen twice you know kind

966
01:30:58,158 --> 01:31:04,920
of thing and uh two days later it

967
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:07,840
happened again and I called Diana and I

968
01:31:04,920 --> 01:31:09,520
was like Diana look because I called her

969
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:12,279
and I told her I said

970
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:14,320
David this is crazy she said I wish

971
01:31:12,279 --> 01:31:18,198
you'd send me

972
01:31:14,319 --> 01:31:20,759
rainbows and I said Diana here I guess

973
01:31:18,198 --> 01:31:22,158
he's only doing them here something you

974
01:31:20,760 --> 01:31:24,840
know and

975
01:31:22,158 --> 01:31:27,599
um he he was really something else I

976
01:31:24,840 --> 01:31:29,719
mean marijuana botney was was was really

977
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:33,480
dear to my heart I don't think we can

978
01:31:29,719 --> 01:31:36,000
mention uh marijuana botney without

979
01:31:33,479 --> 01:31:38,118
mentioning David Watson and we can't

980
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:41,039
mention David Watson without mentioning

981
01:31:38,118 --> 01:31:44,639
Robert colell Clark because those two

982
01:31:41,039 --> 01:31:46,719
guys um are like salt and pepper you

983
01:31:44,639 --> 01:31:48,800
know there's that two sides of the coin

984
01:31:46,719 --> 01:31:51,760
well I say salt and pepper you know what

985
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:55,239
I mean and um it's it's pretty amazing

986
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:58,560
because uh I would uh you know asked

987
01:31:55,238 --> 01:32:01,238
David hey I can almost hear you in

988
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:04,239
marijuana botney sometimes and you know

989
01:32:01,238 --> 01:32:07,118
in these chaps and he said well yeah man

990
01:32:04,238 --> 01:32:09,638
that's because I wrote all the cool

991
01:32:07,118 --> 01:32:12,599
stuff and

992
01:32:09,639 --> 01:32:17,880
it's you know and and he had a way of

993
01:32:12,600 --> 01:32:21,480
hiring the best he knew J Jer he he knew

994
01:32:17,880 --> 01:32:25,760
the best he he wanted quality he knew

995
01:32:21,479 --> 01:32:32,399
how to make you strive for the best and

996
01:32:25,760 --> 01:32:35,639
and today um he's not only um a legend

997
01:32:32,399 --> 01:32:38,399
but he he's someone that I think that we

998
01:32:35,639 --> 01:32:40,679
can all want to be like and if I can

999
01:32:38,399 --> 01:32:42,879
just end with this I probably went over

1000
01:32:40,679 --> 01:32:45,600
the three minutes that's fine but I I

1001
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:48,600
just want to say that you know he took

1002
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:50,560
me under his wing you guys for Christmas

1003
01:32:48,600 --> 01:32:53,360
and and he's known to have a [ __ ]

1004
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:54,520
detective right but he also had a

1005
01:32:53,359 --> 01:32:57,960
compion

1006

01:34:37,118 --> 01:34:46,279
this I first met David uh well I first

1034
01:34:41,238 --> 01:34:49,919
learned of David in I want to say 1996

1035
01:34:46,279 --> 01:34:51,359
he had come to Canada and he was at a a

1036
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:53,440
a hemp

1037
01:34:51,359 --> 01:34:55,359
Symposium uh that we were having we were

1038
01:34:53,439 --> 01:34:56,960
kind of the Manitoba hemp guys at the

1039
01:34:55,359 --> 01:34:59,198
time me and my partners were trying to

1040
01:34:56,960 --> 01:35:00,600
get hemp growing well we had actually we

1041
01:34:59,198 --> 01:35:03,519
had just gotten hemp growing for the

1042
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:05,520
first time in 73 years in our Province

1043
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:07,000
we brought over Zola toosha from the

1044
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:09,199
Ukraine and so we were at this hemp

1045
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:13,238
Symposium and we saw Dave who was

1046
01:35:09,198 --> 01:35:14,919
actually he spoke at this uh event and

1047
01:35:13,238 --> 01:35:17,678
I've got a pretty high level of

1048
01:35:14,920 --> 01:35:19,960
awareness and when I saw him speak I was

1049
01:35:17,679 --> 01:35:22,118
just like this guy is different he is

1050
01:35:19,960 --> 01:35:25,679
not the same as everyone else and there

1051
01:35:22,118 --> 01:35:28,118
was Rumblings and rumors of who he was

1052
01:35:25,679 --> 01:35:31,480
and he was this sort of Infamous

1053
01:35:28,118 --> 01:35:33,399
character uh I wouldn't really meet him

1054
01:35:31,479 --> 01:35:35,718
for a few more years but I would meet

1055
01:35:33,399 --> 01:35:38,319
Robert uh conell Clark through my dear

1056
01:35:35,719 --> 01:35:39,920
friend Hillary black and she would bring

1057
01:35:38,319 --> 01:35:41,679
she brought Rob to my house in the in

1058
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:44,239
the mid 90s and I ended up kind of

1059
01:35:41,679 --> 01:35:47,560
getting to know rob a little bit and on

1060
01:35:44,238 --> 01:35:49,319
a trip to Amsterdam um I bumped into Rob

1061
01:35:47,560 --> 01:35:51,119
and he happened to have a RAR pipe with

1062
01:35:49,319 --> 01:35:53,359
him and he smoked some of this dryft

1063
01:35:51,118 --> 01:35:55,319
with me and he said if it don't if it

1064
01:35:53,359 --> 01:35:57,198
don't bubble it ain't worth the trouble

1065
01:35:55,319 --> 01:35:58,840
and that really stuck in my mind I'd

1066
01:35:57,198 --> 01:36:02,118
never seen hash melt like that little

1067
01:35:58,840 --> 01:36:04,279
did I know that that was David's hash uh

1068
01:36:02,118 --> 01:36:06,319
and in fact that was also David's saying

1069
01:36:04,279 --> 01:36:09,840
and so when I started my company uh in

1070
01:36:06,319 --> 01:36:11,920
1999 fresh hes I used that as the as the

1071
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:14,319
slogan uh if it don't bubble it ain't

1072
01:36:11,920 --> 01:36:16,399
worth of trouble well about I want to

1073
01:36:14,319 --> 01:36:19,439
say 2 days later but it probably was

1074
01:36:16,399 --> 01:36:21,439
more like 2 hours later I get this like

1075
01:36:19,439 --> 01:36:24,039
email from this like

1076
01:36:21,439 --> 01:36:25,839
skunkman yahoo.com

1077
01:36:24,039 --> 01:36:27,319
and he's like if it don't bubble it

1078
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:31,440
ain't worth of trouble do you know who

1079
01:36:27,319 --> 01:36:34,079
first said that and I was like yeah oh

1080
01:36:31,439 --> 01:36:37,118
[ __ ] okay I was like I was like okay I

1081
01:36:34,079 --> 01:36:39,479
got this I replied back I do know who

1082
01:36:37,118 --> 01:36:41,319

1083
01:36:39,479 --> 01:36:43,000
respect for you I will never use it

1084
01:36:41,319 --> 01:36:45,198
again if you don't want or I'll pay you

1085
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:47,279
to use it what do you want me to do and

1086
01:36:45,198 --> 01:36:49,638
for whatever reason that seemed to be

1087
01:36:47,279 --> 01:36:53,800
the right combinations of things to say

1088
01:36:49,639 --> 01:36:56,079
to Dave because he slowly and this is

1089
01:36:53,800 --> 01:36:57,440
1999 for those of you that have known

1090
01:36:56,079 --> 01:37:00,238
Dave a long

1091
01:36:57,439 --> 01:37:03,599
time he was a little bit more difficult

1092
01:37:00,238 --> 01:37:08,959
to to to connect with in 1999 and he was

1093
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:10,760
in 2010 or 2015 it was really uh and and

1094
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:12,719
that was because of his dedication to

1095
01:37:10,760 --> 01:37:14,440
his work he had this incredible

1096
01:37:12,719 --> 01:37:17,639
dedication to this work and as much as

1097
01:37:14,439 --> 01:37:19,399
he did want to have fun as well he would

1098
01:37:17,639 --> 01:37:20,719
sacrific the fun that he could have to

1099
01:37:19,399 --> 01:37:22,960
make sure that the work that he was

1100
01:37:20,719 --> 01:37:25,319
doing was executed properly and so that

1101
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:27,000
was why you know no pictures and much

1102
01:37:25,319 --> 01:37:28,920
more of a private life but somehow

1103
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:31,760
through this bubble bag thing I managed

1104
01:37:28,920 --> 01:37:34,039
to you know meet him at the Pack's party

1105
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:36,280
house for the first time and we were

1106
01:37:34,039 --> 01:37:38,600
like school children all excited and

1107
01:37:36,279 --> 01:37:40,559
Giddy and I remember we he smoked a bowl

1108
01:37:38,600 --> 01:37:43,119
of hash with me and he said look look

1109
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:44,960
when it's really good it's it full melts

1110
01:37:43,118 --> 01:37:46,839
like that and I'm like oh yeah and look

1111
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:48,639
it's got a clear Dome and we're you know

1112
01:37:46,840 --> 01:37:51,159
we're geeking out together and we're

1113
01:37:48,639 --> 01:37:53,159
creating language and vernacular that

1114
01:37:51,158 --> 01:37:55,598
will be used 20 years from now that we

1115
01:37:53,158 --> 01:37:58,238
don't even know we're doing you know it

1116
01:37:55,599 --> 01:38:00,639
wasn't many years later that we decided

1117
01:37:58,238 --> 01:38:02,039
um why don't we you know what if we

1118
01:38:00,639 --> 01:38:03,920
could take all the people at the

1119
01:38:02,039 --> 01:38:05,840
Cannabis Cup in Amsterdam and run them

1120
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:08,760
through your bubble bags and just

1121
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:11,920
collect like the 73 heads and that

1122
01:38:08,760 --> 01:38:14,560
became the legends of hashish dinner and

1123
01:38:11,920 --> 01:38:16,480
so it was an amazing honor to be able to

1124
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:19,000
throw that party with him over the years

1125
