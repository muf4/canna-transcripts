1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:04,560
Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:07,359
It is another beautiful day here in

3
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:10,320
British Columbia. We got Monday morning.

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:12,400
It's about 11:00 a.m. and I just got off

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,879
the deck. I'm going to see my good

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,399
friend Flav 421. Apparently, he's got

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,320
some new mother ships in the house that

8
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:20,679
I need to go see. So, we're going to go

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,800
down there and have a little mothership

10
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:25,600
session. And then, more importantly than

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,359
that, I've got this. It looks like just

12
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,279
a bag that I picked up at the Bob Marley

13
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:35,558
Museum in Kingston, Jamaica. But in

14
00:00:30,278 --> 00:00:37,920
fact, in fact, what it truly is is an

15
00:00:35,558 --> 00:00:40,238
unbelievable collection of genetics that

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,160
could take some a lifetime. Well, Flav's

17
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:44,718
going to get them all in a day. So,

18
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:47,279
let's see what we're giving Flav today.

19
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:50,399
We've got from the good guys at True

20
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,719
Genetics, Phil. We got the sweatb band,

21
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,920
the F1. Got to share when you get

22
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,840
wonderful things. Of course, I'm going

23
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,719
to give Dave the sweatb band. It's

24
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,359
special. the work that's gone into it uh

25
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:04,478
means a lot and uh he's a good friend so

26
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:06,400
I want him to have it. Tried and true

27
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:07,760
Astro Boy. Got to give him the Astro

28
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,080
Boy. It's one of my favorites. The

29
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,600
smell, the taste, the It's just so

30
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:14,478
unbelievable. I I don't know if you guys

31
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:17,000
even saw this uh Astro Boy bud that I

32
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:19,000
just chopped

33
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,040
down. There we

34
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,040
go. Let's see what we got there.

35
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:31,519
It's dank, I'll tell you that

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,319
much. Smells [ __ ] awesome. 100%

37
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:36,000
deliciousness. So, got that just curing

38
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:39,199
away in a in a drawer with a bunch of

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,478
dry sip. So, the Astro Boy going to be

40
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:45,439
giving Flav the Harmony. Now, this came

41
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:47,280
via Doc Atomic from Reefer Man. So,

42
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:51,438
that's a Reefer Man strain, the Harmony.

43
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:53,599
And I threw a couple of little um uh

44
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:55,039
kixes that were on the plant. The plant

45
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:56,559
was stressed and I guess went into a bit

46
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,799
of flour before Doc gave it to me. It

47
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,640
just had these kixes with with resin on

48
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,719
them. I threw those in there just to

49
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:07,439
give Flav a little taste of what this

50
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:10,239
actual nug uh tastes like. Um oh, great

51
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:12,560
gardener Matt the Barbara. I mean, come

52
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,000
on. That's a favorite. The resin

53
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,360
production on this thing, I don't care

54
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,360
what else you have in the room. This

55
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,920
starts producing resin first and it

56
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,160
continues to produce resin last. So the

57
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:23,799
barb is essential to have in the room.

58
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:26,039
Some great gardener

59
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:28,480
genetics. Haven't given this one out

60
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:30,000
yet. Remo gave this one to me when I

61
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:33,280
went there last time and gave him sweet

62
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,479
skunk congo and astro boy. He gave me

63
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:40,239
the UBC chemo kush. So that's from Remo

64
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:42,639
and that's going to flower 421.

65
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,319
Ah, this was a gift again from Phil from

66
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:46,159
the guys at True Genetics, I believe,

67
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:48,399
from his new partner. I'm not sure if

68
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:50,959
that's where it came from, but old

69
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,800
school Ortega. I remember this strain

70
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,519
from the '9s, and I got to tell you, I'm

71
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:59,040
pretty damn excited. It's also in the

72
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:02,400
Astro Boy, the Apollo uh 13 crossed,

73
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:04,000
smacked the um Ortega C99 cross. So,

74
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,319
there's the pure Ortega right there

75
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,840
going to

76
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:09,679
Flav. What else we got? Well, Doc

77
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,280
Atomic. Can't just give a reefer man

78
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,879
strain away via Doc. We got to give

79
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,439
Doc's strain away. So that's the

80
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:17,199
Northern Lights. The one that he picked

81
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:19,199
out for me. I asked him for his most

82
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:22,479
special one and I got to say this one

83
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:23,959
reeks lemons. Major lemons. So that's

84
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:25,719
the

85
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:28,878
Docatomic. We

86
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:31,598
got the always. Oh, what would we call

87
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:33,439
this one? This one is This one causes

88
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:35,439
trouble when you share it. I'm not too

89
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:37,598
sure why. It's no more special than any

90
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:39,799
of the ones I just went by. Although it

91
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:41,679
is special and we do love it, it's the

92
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:45,280
Congolese. So, I got a couple of

93
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:47,920
Congalles cuts uh going to Flab 421

94
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,560
because unlike some uh we believe that

95
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:52,719
it is uh a strain that that should be

96
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,400
shared as all the strains are. I don't

97
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:57,199
really understand the whole rule thing

98
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,719
on strains. I should reiterate that the

99
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:02,479
strain was given to me 100%. I was able

100
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:04,719
to have this strain and I was even told

101
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:06,318
by Raina Ginga that she didn't mind if I

102
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:08,719
had this strain. And I was never given

103
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:10,639
any rules in regards to this strain. So,

104
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:12,719
I just want to reiterate that I'm not

105
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:14,878
one to go [ __ ] around and cause problems

106
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:16,079
in the world. I just believe that a

107
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:18,319
special strain like that should be

108
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:21,759
available to people who are in need of

109
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:23,680
it. So, Flab 421, it's coming your way.

110
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,960
Last, but certainly not least, and this

111
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,600
one I'm going to have to go out on a

112
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:29,918
limb as saying it's the rarest of all

113
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,639
that I just went through because this is

114
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:35,560
the 20-year-old lamb's bread that I craw

115
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:38,319
uh that I popped just a couple of months

116
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:40,240
ago. And this guy right here, um,

117
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:42,879
there's three of them. One is rooted and

118
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,439
two were freshly cut. This is going to

119
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:48,159
be very exciting to see what happens.

120
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:51,279
I'm really quite excited to to to see

121
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,639
what we get produced out of uh out of

122
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:54,239
that lamb's spread. I have some other

123
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,079
Jamaican strains going, but this one is

124
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,240
the only one I have that's 20 years old,

125
00:04:56,079 --> 00:05:02,159
and I'm very excited to get it over the

126
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:04,600
flabs. So, I guess all that is left is

127
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,840
to take a nice big

128
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:11,840
rip and

129
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:13,758
uh actually and make our way uh down to

130
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:15,839
to C Flav and check out these mother

131
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,120
ships. pretty excited. I got to tell

132
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:19,198
you, when Flav calls me and says, "You

133
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,959
got to come by and we got to do a video

134
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,319
on these new pipes I got." I'm like,

135
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:24,319
"All right, I I hear

136
00:05:34,038 --> 00:05:38,000
that." So, hitting the tie nail with the

137
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,280
ceramic insert. You probably can't

138
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,079
really see it there,

139
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:45,638
but I assure you it's there. Keeping the

140
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:48,000
dabber

141
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:49,600
clean. And I think we better do one more

142
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,038
before we head out there. I know it's

143
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,639
going to be tough puffing over there, so

144
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:56,240
we might as well start it out

145
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:58,720
right. Always excited to go to Flabs and

146
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,639
hit sick glass. Sick glass. I mean, the

147
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,639
guy just has the most ridiculous

148
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,639
collection.

149
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,319
Delicious. All right. Well, let's go

150
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,319
deliver us some strains to Flav, shall

151
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,319
we?

152
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,600
Well, guys, I made it to Flabs. I'm here

153
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,360
with Flab 421. And man, you got a nice

154
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,479
little selection of glass out on the

155
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,319
table. Thought I'd bring out a couple

156
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:43,599
pieces that we hadn't hit in a while.

157
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,520
And I think a few of these aren't even

158
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,840
on film. I think this Marcel's not on

159
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:49,439
film. I think this Punty, the Alice

160
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:54,079
tube,

161
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:56,959
uh the custom Man United uh Punty tube.

162
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:59,439
This beautiful new Jake C, which is

163
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:00,879
honestly it's one of my faves right now.

164
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:03,279
Yeah, that's a nice piece. We hit that

165
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:04,959
on your birthday. It is nice. It is.

166
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:06,879
Definitely down to rip that up. And then

167
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:10,478
this, which is one of my favorites. It's

168
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:13,519
my wife's piece, but this Marcel tube

169
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:16,639
that was done for um the other part of

170
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:18,879
High Integrity Glass Art Mhm. and was

171
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:21,280
gifted to me a little later on. But this

172
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:23,199
Marcel piece is just spectacular. Yeah,

173
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:26,638
that's a beauty, man. Really unique

174
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:28,879
stuff that you don't see on a Marcel

175
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,439
pipe all the time. No, definitely. The

176

00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,400
up in the sunlight and I'll make sure to

181
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,400
go through it and and show each piece. I

182
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:45,598
think uh I obviously brought you some

183
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:47,758

Okay, I'm ripping this. The FTK. Ah,

186

very good. Very good. So we have some

187

beline. Oh, we do. We got to split it

188
00:07:55,038 --> 00:08:00,560
into two, but we have some hash.

189
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:03,519
Nice. I brought out some of the

190

00:08:54,559 --> 00:09:01,199
of the guys like Marcel and Jason Lee

206
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:03,679
and Clinton Roman. I mean, the art, the

207

sculpture work, the just the lines, the

208
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:07,439
color choices, everything. It's so

209
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,480
they're they're just so perfect in every

210
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:13,480
way. Yeah. Well, cheers, brother.

211
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,480
Cheers.

212
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:32,120
Oh, that puddle to perfection.

213
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,120
Lovely.

214
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:37,278
We should uh also note that

215
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:39,760
uh you have a bloody World Cup trophy

216
00:09:37,278 --> 00:09:41,679
here. Yeah. And this thing weighs

217
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:43,278
serious. It's a lifesize. Like Wait, is

218
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:46,079
this 30 lb? Yeah, probably something

219
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:47,278
like that. Wow. I just thought that was

220
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,120
hilarious. Yes. I had to have it on the

221
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:50,879
table. Flav collecting the World Cup

222
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,278
trophy. Only English fan to actually

223
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:55,120
hold the World Cup for €150,000. It

224
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:56,399
could be yours.

225
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,759
But don't tell the Germans cuz they're

226
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,958
still looking for it. Yeah. Don't tell

227
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:03,240
the Germans. You don't want the Germans

228
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:05,679
after No, the Germans are coming. Oh no.

229
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:08,159
So, got this bag at the Bob Marley

230
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:11,759
Museum on my last trip to Kingston. And

231
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:14,879
I thought, what better way to bring you

232
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:18,600
these treats. Oh, more gifts. So, we

233
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:21,360
start gifts. with the Jamaican lamb's

234
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:23,600
bread. This is a fully rooted one. Okay.

235
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,560
Like with about 8 in of roots hanging

236
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:29,920
off of it and then two fresh nice cuts.

237
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:29,919
Thank you, sir. So, those are

238
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:37,278
yours. Ah, the ever elusive

239
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:41,120
congalles. Two fresh cuts of the

240
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:43,039
congalles for you, my friend. Thank you.

241
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,480
Um, well, this will be a nice thing for

242
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:46,879
you to have come at you. I know you're

243
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,959
friends with the Doc. Doc dropped these

244
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:51,120
off the NL a couple months, maybe a

245
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:53,359
month and a bit ago. So, this is a his

246
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:56,078
pick, the NL, the Doc atomic NL. I took

247
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,399
two nice cuts. All these cuts are very

248
00:10:56,078 --> 00:11:00,639
clean. You know, I looked after Doc's uh

249
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,879
some of Doc's plants. I remember that.

250
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:04,958
Yeah. For a while when he was on holiday

251
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:06,879
out searching for some some new land

252
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:08,319
races and whatnot out in Thailand. Very

253
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:10,958
nice. Yeah, I Yeah, that's right. He

254
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:14,720
ended up finding them in Cambodia. Yeah.

255
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:16,399
Um, Ortega from uh, True Genetics from

256
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,000
Phil Pearson. Those guys seem to be

257
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,759
doing some really nice work. Yeah, you

258
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,039
know, they have the right foundation.

259
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:25,200
Yep. So, that's a special one. As is

260
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:28,319
this, maybe. All of these are special

261
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,959
ones. Here's a couple from Remo, the UBC

262
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,959
chemo kush. Very nice, dude. He says,

263
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:35,199
"Vegee it longer and you will get bigger

264
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:37,838
buds." Like substantially bigger. Thank

265
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:40,720
you, Remo. Thank you, Bubble Mat. And

266
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:43,120
right from Remo, we go to Matt the great

267
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:47,440
gardener. The Barbara bud. Two fresh

268
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:49,039
cuts of the Barbara. Lovely.

269
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,120
Now, those ones were on a mother that

270
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:53,199
have been outside quite a bit. I dipped

271
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,200
them. I didn't see anything, but some of

272
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,800
the leaves looked a little funky to me.

273
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,879
This is the only one you might have to

274
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:01,919
quarantine. Okay. All of these are as

275
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:03,759
clean as a whistle. Uh, this came via

276
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:07,120
Doc Atomic

277
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:11,120
um from Reefer Man and it's the Harmony

278
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,120
and I actually put a couple of

279
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:15,839
little This is fun cuz I wanted to do

280
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:26,399
this. All right.

281
00:12:22,278 --> 00:12:30,838
So, put those in your hand for a sec and

282
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,839
give those a squeeze and smell those.

283
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:36,879
Oh,

284
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:38,560
dude. Harmony.

285
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:39,759
Yeah, I could sing without harmony.

286
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:41,199
Isn't that ridiculous, though? That is.

287
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:42,399
Yeah. I literally was like searching the

288
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,959
plan. I was like, I got to find one

289
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,559
more. Cuz I accidentally ripped one off

290
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:48,239
and then I I smelt my fingers. I was

291
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:49,518
like, you got to be kidding. Wow. Is

292
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:53,639
that not dank?

293
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,639
little smell of that thing, dude.

294
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:59,039
That has such a nice sweetness to it.

295
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:01,760
Yeah, that's going to be something to uh

296
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:05,360
enjoy. Yeah. And so, right behind that,

297
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:07,039
TGA Genetics, the Astro Boy. Come on,

298
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,680
dude. Of course, I'm going to give you

299
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:13,519
the Astro Boy. What a kickown head here,

300
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:17,039

301
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:19,600
Pearson's True Genetics sweatb band. Oh,

302
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:22,958
the sweatb band.

303
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:25,200
So there it is, dude. This this is this

304
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:28,479

306
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,360
Thank you so much. Absolutely. Sharing

307
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:35,199
is caring. Uh yeah, it's never a bad

308
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,639
thing to share your genetics. Uh

309
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,079
especially if you know the people that

310
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,399
you're sharing them with are righteous

311
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:42,719
people who are looking to also get the

312
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:46,879
genetics out there or just grow the

313
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:48,800
genetics and uh use it as a medicine.

314
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:50,559
So, there's those. I'm sure you might

315
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:52,078
want to put them in your fridge. I will.

316
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:53,439
For the time being or whatnot. They'll

317
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:56,159
definitely be good in there for a bit.

318
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,720
Yeah. And then we're going to get to I

319
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:00,399
think we should puff sampling the wares.

320
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,800
Yes. So, that's what's happening. On

321
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:07,000
from sampling the strains to sampling

322
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:07,000
the boro. Hell yeah.

323
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:12,799
We'll get it

324
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:17,440
going. So, after an epic genetic

325
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:19,439
giveaway or an epic genetic give, re

326
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,839
reception, we need to puff. Oh, yes. You

327
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:25,040
know, so I'm feeling that.

328
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:28,639
Oh, yeah. Can I borrow a flame? By all

329
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:32,639
means. So nice.

330
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:34,079
Yeah. The Alice piece by Panty. Ponty.

331
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:38,600
That was done when he was still at the

332
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:38,599
mother ship. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

333
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,519
Now

334
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:59,679
that was the season. Yeah, that was very

335
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:03,560
nice.

336
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:03,559
Very nice. That's incredible.

337
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:12,799
Like come on. Yeah, he's not shabby.

338
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:15,120
It's incredible. I'll show you guys.

339
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:16,559
This This one is my personal favorite

340
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:20,000
hunting piece, but only because I'm such

341
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:21,838
a giant United supporter. Glory. Glory.

342
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,799
Here's two things you've never seen

343
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:26,800
together. Yeah. I don't even know. Have

344
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:29,519
they ever won? Well, that's this is for

345
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:31,519
nations. This is for just a club. Yeah.

346
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:34,240
So, England has won the World Cup in

347
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,919
1966, but they pick a bunch of people

348
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:39,198
from their favorite. Oh, yeah. There's a

349
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:40,399
United players on the team, but um most

350
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:41,679
I don't know. I don't No, I know. No, I

351
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,839
know you're not a big footie fan. No, I

352
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:46,000
know for sure. But um but I respect the

353
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,760
fact that you are. Yes. You're

354
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,120
Manchester United. That is I remember

355
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:52,319
even when you got this how stoked you

356
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:54,278
were. Oh, yes, I do. In in life, my most

357
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:57,120
cherished things on this planet are

358
00:15:54,278 --> 00:16:01,039
family, United, and then everything

359
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:02,799
else. Nice. Damn. Yeah, I'm under

360
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:05,519
United.

361
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:07,359
Sorry. It's cool. Uh, well, my love for

362
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,639
myself is even under my love for United.

363
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,919
Should pack it up with a little bit of

364
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,480
dry stuff that I made. Oh, yeah.

365
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:15,360
Wonderful.

366
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,920
Oh, it's like an apple a day.

367
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,800
An apple a day will feed your

368
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:22,198
endockinabonoid system and keep the

369
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:22,198
doctor away.

370
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:28,160
Cuz you got to keep that system fully

371
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:29,518
fed, fully charged. Absolutely. I had

372
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:31,198
quite a few people talk to me in the

373
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,679
last couple of days with loved ones that

374
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:38,399
have uh that are just being told that

375
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:40,078
they have uh fairly harsh cancers and I

376
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,000
mean I tell people to go to the Facebook

377
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:44,799
page the endockinabonoid system. It

378
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,799
seems to me to be a very good source of

379
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:48,639
as much of that information as possible.

380
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:50,719
Yeah, it is. And then without even, you

381
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:53,039
know, I tell people also that just to

382
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,800
consume it, to eat cannabis to get it

383
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:57,120
into your body, whether it's the extract

384
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:59,120
or the oil or the hash or the bud,

385
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,519
that's a good start right there. You you

386
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,519
need to consume it. I mean, yeah, what

387
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:06,720
we're doing is is more of a euphoric

388
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:08,400
enjoyed feeling. Um, it opens our minds

389
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,000
to the fact that we do also need to

390
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,038
consume it. I consume a little bit of it

391
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,679
every day and coconut oil infused hash

392
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:18,400
and I put creams on my my arm and my

393
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:21,679
back where I have pain from broken bones

394
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:24,000
with me in the fence. Yeah, CBD and CBC.

395
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:26,559
That's a good thing to do. Yeah. And so

396
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,599
many other ways too, right? It's

397
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:31,678
definitely um Yeah, it's a good thing to

398
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:33,519
feed your endockinabonoid system and in

399
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,519
more ways than just combustion. In more

400
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:37,119
ways than just combustion. My god. If

401
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:38,720
you're going to do it with combustion,

402
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:40,959
you might as well do it this way. We

403
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,798
certainly picked the most beautiful,

404
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,079
ridiculous pieces. Let's go on this guy

405
00:17:42,798 --> 00:17:47,759
now. That's what I was looking at. This

406
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:50,399
This Marcel here, I'll I'll you can hold

407
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:52,798
you can to I'll pack and I'll light cuz

408
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,720
this one's just more enjoyable to hold

409
00:17:52,798 --> 00:17:56,359
and have others do the work for you. Oh,

410
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,798
what do you want? Dry

411
00:17:56,359 --> 00:18:02,959
sift. Some of this sift. Some of this

412
00:17:59,798 --> 00:18:05,759
bubble. Some of your bubble. Let's try a

413
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,000
little bit of this. Ooh, the Astro.

414
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:10,640
Yeah, I love

415
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:13,279
it. Just put a little a little patty in

416
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:16,120
there. Look at this thing. Arms length.

417
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:21,480
How does your wife use this pipe?

418
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:21,479
Um, she handles it like a champ. Nice.

419
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:44,720
I know that there's a big rage, you

420
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,400
know, for all the smaller tubes and

421
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:49,038
smaller pieces, but there's just

422
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:51,679
something about a large piece like this

423
00:18:49,038 --> 00:18:53,359
that's just I could imagine being so

424
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,880
much harder to keep from cracking in the

425
00:18:53,359 --> 00:19:00,038
kiln. The size of the kil you're going

426
00:18:54,880 --> 00:19:03,520
to need. Oh, yes. from big to

427
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:05,759
tiny little chip work uh mini Carlson

428
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:07,918
Shirley. Yeah, that's unreal. Yeah, the

429
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:10,558
constru uh the the the way he put this

430
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:13,038
together, the constriction points are

431
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:15,200
very good for a big bong. It does not

432
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:17,679
feel like a huge bong. No, it really

433
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,919
feels like it's tight and it's small in

434
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:22,000
there. not this huge open cuz as you

435
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:24,080
know as we start to smoke less of the

436
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,919
herb or none of the herb in my case and

437
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:27,599
all concentrates the better the

438
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,840
concentrate shop the better the

439
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:32,558
concentrates are I just seem to

440
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:34,720
appreciate them more through a smaller

441
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:36,879
piece yes I I actually do agree with you

442
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,519
and although this is a big piece it's

443
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,120
not really that big you know you feel it

444
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:42,720
the restrict the restriction in it yeah

445
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:44,719
it's got a it's got a nice chug to it

446
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,919
yeah the restriction is good yeah it is

447
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,519
very good considering there's like a

448
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:50,240
half liter of water in the base of it

449
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:51,839
Wow. Yeah. Well, that's probably the key

450
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,720
right there. Not leaving that. You bring

451
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:58,639
that right up to the top here. I noticed

452
00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:01,160
there it is. Got to love visiting Flav.

453
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:04,400
Hitting glass like this. And this little

454
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:06,240
guy, as you can see,

455
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,320
put your hand behind it and then hold it

456
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,079
up close to the camera and it'll grab it

457
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:12,480
real nice.

458
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:15,279
It's very small. Mhm. We can show it in

459
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:18,480
the sunlight as well. It's a pretty damn

460
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:18,480
nice little piece.

461
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,519
doing it

462
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:34,079
up. Such beautiful

463
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:42,158
pieces. Like they really are just

464
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:46,879
beautiful, beautiful artistic pieces.

465
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:50,000
Yeah. Marcel's just obviously, you know,

466
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:51,760
OG. He's just OG and he's just in a

467
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,599
sense the same way Mothership is on

468
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:56,558
another level, I find Marcel to be on

469
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:59,240
another level. Agreed. He's my favorite.

470
00:20:56,558 --> 00:21:02,240
They're just uh completely on different

471
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:04,400
levels from the majority. Oh my god. I

472
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:07,038
love that. Jake, see is the water's in

473
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:10,159
there. Yeah. That it's open. Yeah,

474
00:21:07,038 --> 00:21:12,720
that's the best. The marble on the back

475
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:16,039
is hollow and it's shows the water line

476
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,038
of the pipe.

477
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:25,798
How is the water right now? It's just um

478
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:25,798
in the disc. All of it?

479
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:32,720
Put a little more. Yeah.

480
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:37,720
But yeah, these this JC amazing the work

481
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,720
that the mothership crew is doing now is

482
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:45,120
man that little Carlson. Holy

483
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:45,119
Christ.

484
00:21:45,558 --> 00:21:48,558
Pretty

485
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:57,798
cool. Always such a pleasure to be

486
00:21:53,839 --> 00:22:02,439
around such beautiful glass. Punty

487
00:21:57,798 --> 00:22:05,400
Marcel Marcel fat plan forest from

488
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:07,840
mothership Manchester

489
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:10,159
United. And uh he's coming back with

490
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:12,240
that uh

491
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:14,159
what do you call that? It's a JC mini

492
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,880
straight fab.

493
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:19,200
JC Mini straight. Yeah. Made the line

494
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:22,960
work. So nice. I like the way he's got

495
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:24,880
this up high. Yeah. Yeah. And just boom.

496
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,400
Everything's attached.

497
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,400
Yeah.

498
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,400
Fixed bucket. Slides. No, everything's

499
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,919
fixed. See, I don't know the lingo. I

500
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,159
like that I'm learning it, though.

501
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:37,038
Everything's attached. It's called fixed

502
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:39,159
bubble man. That's cool. I can admit my

503
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:41,839
ignorance in the regards to

504
00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:43,919
uh to your knowledge in the glass scene.

505
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:46,798
It's always a pleasure. You keep me

506
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:51,640
updated. Be kind to my eyes and my ears.

507
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:51,639
Indeed. Sure is beautiful.

508
00:22:54,798 --> 00:23:04,119
Shall we dab it? Uh yeah. We need some

509
00:22:58,798 --> 00:23:06,240
melty goodness and some heat. And we're

510
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:08,639
graing. Yeah. The hit on this one

511
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,640
actually is really nice. This is one of

512
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:15,440
the better hitting pieces that I've

513
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:18,080
acquired more recently. I like it.

514
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,080
Darn

515
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:24,960
tootin. We're going to hit a little. You

516
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:28,479
know, I did forget my my carb cap

517
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,840
downstairs. Ooh, always good. So, I'm

518
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,120
just going to heat this up pretty good

519
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:32,480
here. I'm just going to give us

520
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:34,558
reasonable hits so we don't need the

521
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,558
carb cap. Okay. I find when you put a

522
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:38,480
bigger one in that the carb cap is

523
00:23:36,558 --> 00:23:41,759
extremely necessary. Yeah, we're just

524
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:43,200
hitting nice little one bangers. Be

525
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:46,200
good. It's right on the bottom there.

526
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,200
Yeah.

527
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:00,108
[Applause]

528
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,640
This is a banger. Yeah, I can hear it up

529
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:09,119
a little more. I think actually I think

530
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:13,559
it did okay though. It worked.

531
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:13,558
You know your pipe. Yeah.

532
00:24:37,278 --> 00:24:40,480
Booya. Oh

533
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:45,559
wow. That one open up.

534
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:53,200
Oh yeah. Oh, that is [ __ ] tasty.

535
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:55,839
Booyah. Shine indeed. Yeah, that Homa.

536
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,919
His afghan. That's the one I wished I

537
00:24:55,839 --> 00:24:59,678
would have brought you. The Afghany. Oh

538
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:01,440
yeah. Next time. Next time. Got to leave

539
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:03,360
something for next time. I love that

540
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,278
Afghany. It's soon becoming one of my

541
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:07,199
favorites in the in the garden. It just

542
00:25:05,278 --> 00:25:09,119
res both the Afghani and the barb. I

543
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,640
mean the barb obviously has the Afghany

544
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:14,798
in it. It's

545
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:17,440
um they're nice. They really they they

546
00:25:14,798 --> 00:25:19,679
they thicken up faster. They produce

547
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,519
resin quicker. Other than Astro Boy.

548
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,600
Astro Boy produces resin very early on.

549
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:25,519
Astro Boy makes I mean it's all about

550
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:27,839
the the resin farming, right? So I mean

551
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:29,359
the ones that create the the great

552
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:31,119
resin, the Astro Boy has always been

553
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:34,240
great for that. It's always made such

554
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:36,798
good hash. Oh my gosh. As it ever. Yeah.

555
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:39,120
So yeah, you have a pretty healthy

556
00:25:36,798 --> 00:25:41,278
collection. Thank you. To add to the

557
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:44,599
show. I look forward to seeing what you

558
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:47,440
do with it. Yeah.

559
00:25:44,599 --> 00:25:49,359
Well, there is certainly plans in the in

560
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:55,360
the works.

561
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:55,359
We have uh a little bit of the star

562
00:25:57,159 --> 00:26:02,000
dog. It sure has a nice bouquet on it.

563
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:03,400
Hey, it does. Yeah. Yeah. It's kind of

564
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,720
hard for me to

565
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:10,320
pinpoint. Exactly.

566
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:13,200
That's you. Um you know, it's it's kind

567
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:16,519
it's kind of hard to pinpoint. I It's

568
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:20,000
like It's kind of caramelly, but

569
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:20,000
like like

570
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,640
like evergreen. Yeah, there's it's

571
00:26:27,038 --> 00:26:30,480
smooth though and caramelly. It is

572
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:33,360
smooth. It definitely smells like like

573
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:35,839
burnt sugars. Smells flushed if that

574
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:37,599
makes any sense. Yeah.

575
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:40,079
How long of a flush did you do on that?

576
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:41,678
Long like 3 weeks, four weeks. Four and

577
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:45,119
a half. Awesome. That's the way to do

578
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:47,360
it. Yeah. This was this was this is all

579
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:50,319
from leftovers from a plant that was in

580
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:52,399
a big 20 g. Yeah. I can't wait to uh I

581
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:54,960
have this going from the clone you gave

582
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,559
me. Nice. I managed to keep it alive

583
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,840
while I was away in Jamaica. My wife

584
00:26:56,558 --> 00:27:02,558
kept it alive, so that was wonderful. I

585
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:05,439
um it's rooted and transplanted and

586
00:27:02,558 --> 00:27:07,278
growing. So, should start producing into

587
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:10,480
a little plant here soon. I've got a

588
00:27:07,278 --> 00:27:12,919
couple of other tents that are blooming.

589
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:15,200
seem to be a little bit slow on the

590
00:27:12,919 --> 00:27:17,919
blooming. They're they're they're

591
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:20,400
blooming, but they're they're sativas.

592
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:21,759
So, yeah, they're at two weeks or or 3

593
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,240
weeks, and they look like they're at one

594
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:26,640
week, two weeks. Another 10 to go. Yeah.

595
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,880
I mean, some of them have a good two and

596
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:31,919
a half months left. Totally. Another 10

597
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:33,520
weeks, even longer, depending on. So, I

598
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,679
do have in the other in the other tent,

599
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:39,679
one's just pure sativa. It's East Coast

600
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:41,840
sour Diesel, it's Congalles, and it's um

601
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:43,759
Sweet skunk. Nice. The other one I have

602
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:47,038
a variety. I have John's My Little Pony

603
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:48,319
in there. I have I I have a Jamaican.

604
00:27:47,038 --> 00:27:51,440
The first one that I'm blooming with the

605
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:53,839
Jamaican that I'm awesomely excited.

606
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:55,679
Yeah. Exactly. Right. I know. It's not

607
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:57,839
the most amazing looking plant. No. But

608
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:00,159
just because like from the history of

609
00:27:57,839 --> 00:28:01,678
it, from the seed to like how long it

610
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:03,200
was sitting, whether whether or not

611
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,480
we're going to keep it, you know,

612
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,840
whether or not all the people I gave

613
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,360
that cut to were going to be like, "Oh,

614
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:08,798
I was just excited to see it cuz you're

615
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:10,879
the first one to have flowers from it."

616
00:28:08,798 --> 00:28:12,158
Yeah. Exactly. I will be. Absolutely.

617
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,919
So, I'm pretty excited about that. And

618
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:17,039
there's a couple other strains in in

619
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:18,880
with those as well. I have some other

620
00:28:17,038 --> 00:28:21,119
things. I can't remember off the top of

621
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:23,760
my head, but I think an Afghany and a

622
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:25,759
barb. Yeah. It's always nice to have one

623
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:27,759
of those in each. You won't believe it.

624
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:31,519
For hasht

625
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:33,640
Yeah, that that that uh that barb really

626
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:36,798
produces resin like you wouldn't

627
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:38,320
believe, man. That's nice.

628
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:42,398
Well, I think we're going to continue on

629
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:45,119
and puff uh puff some bowls. We might uh

630
00:28:42,398 --> 00:28:47,278
I'll I'll I'll I'll show you a nice uh

631
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:49,199
sort of lineup of all the pipes in the

632
00:28:47,278 --> 00:28:53,200
sun with the video camera so you get a

633
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:55,200
real nice breakdown. And uh dude, as

634
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:58,558
always, it's a pleasure, man. Thanks for

635
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:01,558
having me over, man. Boom. Peace out,

636
