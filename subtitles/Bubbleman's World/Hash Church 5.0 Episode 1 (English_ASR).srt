in to the one that's live and then I go

66

00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:23,000
started hash church I think I did 162

112
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:25,439
Sundays in a row and that was uh that

113
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,079
was absolutely insane around 1:40 my

114
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:29,759
wife sort of pulled me aside and she's

115

stressful trying to make sure the

119
00:05:35,478 --> 00:05:38,639
episode was perfect that the panelists

120
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,919
would show up that everything would

121
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,199
start on time that I would have internet

122
00:05:40,918 --> 00:05:46,038
depending on the country that I was in

123
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:49,038

um at that point uh according to my

203

cancer and uh

212
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,480
to make it really short uh the real

213
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:09,680
issue here is pain and uh I'm here to

214
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:12,159
testify for the beauty and efficacy of

215
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:16,799
cannabis in the relief of

216
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:17,958
pain I have uh my oncologist asked me to

217
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:22,199

there's really lovely tastes available

223
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:46,639
by consumption into the gut as versus

224
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:48,240
inhaling uh so that's a whole

225
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:51,759
conversation

cotherapy

228
00:10:53,159 --> 00:11:00,159
again and after being off of it since

00:10:57,799 --> 00:11:01,559
May and

230
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:03,159
I suppose one of the things that I'm

231
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:06,759
really looking forward to chatting with

232
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:09,278
you all about is I came across a paper

233
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:11,919
in a journal called

234
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:15,240
biofactors and they looked at three

235
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:18,278
different multiple myom cell lines and

236
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:21,320
compared those multiple my cell lines to

237
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:23,078
how did they react to quote unquote

238
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:28,160
minor phyto

239
00:11:23,078 --> 00:11:33,159

golf and CBN as in Nancy have really

241
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:40,078
remarkable effects at slowing the growth

242
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:43,800
of multiple my cells and at the right

243
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:46,559

them not just to me but to any person

281
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:42,639
who shows up at our local dispensary

282
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:45,399
with a cannabis recommendation we have a

283
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:49,159
program to give these products at no

284
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:52,120
cost for the persons who need them and

285
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:54,240
uh for the first time I'm actually a

286
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:58,679
recipient of a program that I help set

287
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:59,639
up that way and I I would I would just

say uh my spirit I I feel very full of

291
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:14,800
myself in the spirit but the body is

292
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:18,159
really having a lot of trouble and

293
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:22,359
um I will note that for most people

294
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:24,078
multiple myma is not a fatal condition

295
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:26,680
there other things that happen as a

296
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:29,719
result of proving the condition that

297
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:33,319
usually results in death

298
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:35,680
so I'm here for years to come let's keep

299

310
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:08,439
want to share any of those names in the

311
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,320
chat I can put them in the description

312
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:12,800
so maybe some people who are living in

313
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,399
your area hear what you say and rather

314
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:18,000
than you know in inable to shorten the

315
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:19,839
ability for them get to A to B we can

316
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,320
remove sort of all the middle things by

317
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,519
just putting up a few links for

318
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,278
companies we're not trying to blow

319
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:27,159
companies up that are doing good work

320
00:15:24,278 --> 00:15:29,399
and and donating but I would also say

321
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:31,399
perhaps for some of the Growers may be

322
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:33,360
watching as well if we put up these

323
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:35,559
links you know maybe they won't just be

324
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,480
people reaching out who need oil but

325
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:39,758
there'll be people reaching out who have

326
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:41,920
biomass to donate for companies like

327
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:44,480
this that can give that oil away because

328
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:46,639
without that aspect it's really just out

329
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,959
of pocket for the one group and what a

330
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,919
great thing to be a part of uh you know

331
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:52,679
gifting out oil to people who are really

332
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:54,599
in the needs you know a lot of people

333
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:56,479
are looking to fill a hole in their soul

334
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:59,879
right now and it doesn't happen with new

335
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:02,440
Nikes uh and and and Bugatti Veyrons it

336
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:04,958
happens by serving the people and when

337
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:07,639
you can do that you will uh you will

338
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:10,399
feel you know God or whatever it is you

339
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:11,959
believe in in your heart uh by by

340
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,879
serving others and I always feel it when

341
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:16,638
Wade comes in and shares with us I can

342
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:18,759
it's so crazy to think 10 years ago he

343
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:21,000
was sharing about the harleyquinn and

344
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:24,120
about like creating and doing this work

345
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,679
himself giving away biomass and now he's

346
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:29,720
on the receiving end of it uh in this

347
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:31,359
beautiful sort of uh karmic retribution

348
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:33,120
where it just came right around and said

349
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,919
hey homie like you took care of so many

350
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,879
people for so long now there's going to

351
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:40,919
be people taking care of you so it's

352
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:43,639
really uh quite powerful to see um

353
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:46,799
welcome to uh to to best friend Farms

354
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:48,680
who just popped in um you know we're

355
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:51,000
just chilling out you probably caught

356
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:52,919
the end of of Wade's update he's been

357
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,679
fighting the good fight against uh

358
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:58,519
against cancer and uh looking good and

359
00:16:56,679 --> 00:17:00,679
yeah and and looking good man and you

360
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:02,360
know didn't even skip a beat doctor told

361
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:05,438
him he couldn't smoke anymore he's like

362
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:07,558
he's gobbling it down which I will say I

363
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:11,079
have never seen a human being eat more

364
00:17:07,558 --> 00:17:13,480
canabo in my life than Thomas up in the

365
00:17:11,078 --> 00:17:16,240
corner of the screen with the rain

366
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:18,199
falling down that [ __ ] guy ate like

367
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,439
24 every time I say this he's like oh it

368
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:23,279
wasn't that much man it was only like

369
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:25,279
1,800 no it was 2400 milligrams for a

370
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:27,798
plane ride I can't remember if it was

371
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:31,558
Berlin or Barcelona it was one of those

372
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:33,918
places but this is this gets into the

373
00:17:31,558 --> 00:17:36,359
chemistry and the science of the body

374
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:38,480
obviously Mark we're all metabolizing at

375
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:41,279
different rates how is it that someone

376
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:45,120
can get destroyed by two milligrams and

377
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:47,480
another person can take 2400 milligrams

378
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:48,959
and totally be cognitive talking to me

379
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,880
like right sitting next to me like hey

380
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,640
man you want a

381
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:57,480
bagel

382
00:17:52,640 --> 00:18:00,880
CBD CV no that was thca THC is what he

383
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:02,440
was he was consuming I just uh yeah it's

384
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,720
mind-blowing to think that someone could

385
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:06,840
consume that much I don't mind eating it

386
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,400
myself but I'm kind of like once I get

387
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:11,199
into the 30 milligram range that's like

388
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:14,000
I'm like oh I'm like more High than I

389
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,640
want to be you know I'm good with 10 and

390
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,319
20 I don't know about the rest of the

391
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:21,080
the group here I probably got some

392
00:18:17,319 --> 00:18:24,399
Hondos in the in the mix but oh yeah how

393
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:27,079
B available it is right I mean but does

394
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:29,360
it not also depend on how you metabolize

395
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:32,879
in your liver

396
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:35,959
right well yeah yeah it depends on a lot

397
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:39,360
of things you know like is it so if it's

398
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:43,960
if it's T8 CA right it's one thing if

399
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:46,199
it's THC it's another right but yeah I I

400
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:49,400
think that like if you're just eating

401
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:51,400
hash if just the a lot of it is just

402
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:54,200
going to be sort of you know making it

403
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:56,038
down to the gut yeah it's probably

404
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:58,159
entering in the system more in the

405
00:18:56,038 --> 00:18:59,480
stomach than in the liver but I I I I

406
00:18:58,159 --> 00:19:01,799
don't know I

407
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:05,038
I think it's bioavailable you know when

408
00:19:01,798 --> 00:19:07,279
it gets metabolized and yeah I mean

409
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:10,000
that's probably helping him and in great

410
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:12,440
ways and you know I mean again this is

411
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,960
like the full what do we call this the

412
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:19,120
Entourage effect or Ensemble effect or

413
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:21,558
whatever the fact that CBN and CBG both

414
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:24,918
play a role so You' imagine that you

415
00:19:21,558 --> 00:19:26,798
know you could almost dial that in to a

416
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:29,600
specific oil that's got a specific

417
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:31,960
amount of CBN um that's what I was going

418
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:35,279
to ask you Wade I mean like what what's

419
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:37,600
effective in terms of CBN concentration

420
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:40,960
in the products that you taking I mean

421
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:43,399
is it um highly concentrated CBN because

422
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,200
actually there is CBN isolate but I

423
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:48,559
think it's completely synthetic that's

424
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:52,558
out there but there's also just tied you

425
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:55,960
know in concentration CBN oil um are you

426
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:58,759
doing more of a full spectrum or isolate

427
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:03,759
treatment I haven't uh I have not had

428
00:19:58,759 --> 00:20:07,879
had any uh success so far in sourcing

429
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:10,640
CBN uh particularly at the quantities of

430
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:13,640
milligrams that I'm hoping to be able to

431
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,640
access

432
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:19,960
um yeah I I have access to Abundant CBG

433
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:24,240
still working on

434
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:25,840
CBM and um from my point of view one of

435
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:29,279
the things I think is most interesting

436
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:32,359
is the canono that are produced very

437
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:34,200
early in the plant's life cycle and the

438
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:36,759
degradation products at the end of the

439
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:39,960
plant's life cycle show the greatest

440
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:42,839
promise for this particular cancer and

441
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:46,279
it's intriguing to me that as a consumer

442
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:50,119
of cannabis I tended to avoid CBG and

443
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:52,279
CBM right of course see any anti-cancer

444
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:54,279
effects from my can from my cannabis

445
00:20:52,279 --> 00:20:58,200
consumption that we've

446
00:20:54,279 --> 00:20:59,720
always go ahead um yeah so there's a

447
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:03,319
there's something that's going on to

448
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:07,798
make sort of so-called um compliant

449
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:10,119
distill it so when they um distill you

450
00:21:07,798 --> 00:21:13,480
know quote unquote hemp like it's like a

451
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:17,239
21 variety or better or something like

452
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:19,599
that and you still have enough THC in

453
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:22,038
the distillate um what they've been

454
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:25,038
doing is if you uh heat up that

455
00:21:22,038 --> 00:21:29,119
distillate and bubble air through it the

456
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:30,200
air um will oxidize the THC convert it

457
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:33,839
over to

458
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:36,600
CBN such that you can actually make a

459
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:37,678
quote unquote compliable oil that's

460
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:40,319
below

461
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:44,000
the3 threshold because a lot of these

462
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:46,240
distillates are like a couple percent in

463
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,440
THC and even you could do this at the

464
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:52,679
crude level too so it's just like a

465
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:55,440
crude ethanol extract if you bubble air

466
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:59,240
through while you're heating the oil the

467
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:00,840
air will convert the THC into CBN

468
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,640
so you might be able to do that on your

469
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:05,759
own and not have to rely on somebody

470
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:08,400
else providing it to

471
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:10,839
you thank you Mark that sounds like a

472
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,640
plan I will be talking to some of our

473
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:14,240
local

474
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:16,799
manufacturers thank you yeah they do

475
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:19,120
that to make so socalled uh well they

476
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:21,440
they call remediated oil or what's

477
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:23,319
called tea free oil or tea free

478
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:27,400
distillate and the way that they're

479
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:29,960
pulling off that stunt is Yeah by um in

480
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,278
that process you don't lose a lot of

481
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:34,840
your

482
00:22:31,278 --> 00:22:36,720
CBD you could eventually start

483
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:39,558
converting some of your CBD but you

484
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:42,880
could sort of finesse that process to

485
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:45,960
basically remove THC or get it below the

486
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:48,159
detectable limit or at least below the

487
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:50,720
three limit and make it what's called T

488
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:53,520
free so when you see that category of

489
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:56,000
tfree distillator tfree crude that's

490
00:22:53,519 --> 00:23:00,440
probably how they did it which is this

491
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,440
remediation process by using just simp

492
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:05,918
air we have it available in Canada by

493
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,519
the leader uh

494
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:09,759
CBN fairly pure but it's expensive it's

495
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:12,119
like the last time I checked I think it

496
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:15,440
was $11,000 a liter whereas like

497
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:18,759
distillate like THC or CBD is I want to

498
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:20,720
say like below $2 like maybe under a

499
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:23,000
dollar even I somewhere around there

500
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:26,480
anyway per gram yeah so you could buy

501
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:29,278
CBN isolate for cheaper than that right

502
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:31,919
now CBN isolate down here is somewhere

503
00:23:29,278 --> 00:23:34,278
like about three or 4 thousand a kilo

504
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:36,640
American this will be from a plant like

505
00:23:34,278 --> 00:23:38,720
derived right from cannabis for sure I

506
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:41,880
don't think that Canada allows any type

507
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:44,159
of synthesis on can this is completely

508
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:45,960
synthetic Mark yeah yeah yeah no I I

509
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,400
knew I that's why I mentioned it I

510
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:49,798
figured you were talking about the

511
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:51,440
synthetic I I couldn't I was actually

512
00:23:49,798 --> 00:23:53,679
talking with someone yesterday and they

513
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:56,960
said it was $1,200 in Canada for

514
00:23:53,679 --> 00:24:00,360
distillate that was 92% THC I I was kind

515
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:03,319
of mind blown buy it a dollar T I was

516
00:24:00,359 --> 00:24:05,079
like well what's the point of growing uh

517
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:07,278
when you can buy it at that cost and I

518
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:09,678
wanted to ask Wade are you taking

519
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:15,839
everything or

520
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:18,400
orally yes yeah okay um my uh cousin 18

521
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:21,240
months ago was diagnosed with stage four

522
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:24,000
liver cancer and um he can't take

523
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:25,399
anything or orally just he gets way too

524
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,119
high and he can't really smoke but he's

525
00:24:25,398 --> 00:24:30,599
been taking it suppository and pretty

526
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:32,959
it's pretty incredible in the they just

527
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:34,839
did like um like they tested all his

528
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,640
tumors they did X-rays and in three

529
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:38,798
months they haven't had any growth at

530
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,840
all and he's been just take yeah it's

531
00:24:38,798 --> 00:24:42,440
it's pretty incredible and you know he

532
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:46,000
he was told he only had six months to

533
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:47,200
live 18 months ago and he was he came

534
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,480
and actually stayed with me and he's

535
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:52,120
been just like taking so much oil and he

536
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:54,120
goes in um in a hyper barar chamber I

537
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:55,678
think it's called We're with pressure

538
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:57,519
and it seems like the combination of

539
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:59,000
these two um it's pretty incredible that

540
00:24:57,519 --> 00:24:59,918
he's still with us anyway I just wanted

541
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,720

guys that you see yourself in like his

550
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:27,840
passion and his excitement about hash um

551
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:31,640
I couldn't have my brand in a place like

552
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:33,240
Michigan without Ryan or someone exactly

553
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:35,000
like him you know someone that has the

554
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,679
passion someone that's been like I watch

555
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,278
the hash churches I studyed what you

556
00:25:36,679 --> 00:25:41,440
guys are doing I listen to every video

557
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:43,440
I've learned from my own mistakes I went

558
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:46,120
off and did my own mistakes and created

559
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,919
this knowledge that uh you know you just

560
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:50,719
obviously we need great Growers and we

561
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:52,880
need a variety of things to do a brand

562
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,798
but really without uh without a guy like

563
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,600
Ryan the brand wouldn't uh wouldn't be

564
00:25:54,798 --> 00:26:00,200
going anywhere fast so why don't you

565

fun um yeah lately we're working on some

580
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:41,440
brick hash and some hash hits that we're

581
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:45,120
about to bring to the market and then we

582

00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,200
to just one person's screen when they're

593

uh tell us a little bit about yourself

601
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,240
Thomas I don't think you've ever been on

602
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:37,359
hash church people have obviously seen

603
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:39,038
your show on my channel but yeah Thomas

604
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:40,278
and I have been working together for a

605
00:27:39,038 --> 00:27:42,480
little while now I don't know if it's

606
00:27:40,278 --> 00:27:44,919
been six months or even if it's almost a

607
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:47,919
year um but yeah he's got The

608
00:27:44,919 --> 00:27:50,559
Grandmaster LEDs the UVC lights the

609
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:52,919
whole variety of insanity Thomas is kind

610
00:27:50,558 --> 00:27:55,519
of like a mad scientist Savant when it

611
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:58,960
comes to producing and creating lights

612
00:27:55,519 --> 00:28:02,720
that uh if you tell them you can't do it

613
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:04,919
he will absolutely [ __ ] do it yeah

614
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:07,079
well my team kind of gets mad at me that

615
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:09,038
sometimes because uh well in just even

616
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:10,798
the light that you're looking at we re

617
00:28:09,038 --> 00:28:13,278
uh redesigned it three different times

618
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:14,879
or well you know when doing something

619
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:16,480
you have a completed product and then

620
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,399
all of a sudden you see a better way of

621
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:21,038
doing it um so I've been in the lighting

622
00:28:19,398 --> 00:28:23,599
business for seven and a half years I've

623
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:26,720
been growing indoor since 96 been

624
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:29,759
growing outdoor since 94 it's a it's a

625
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:31,519
really big passion um for me and to me

626
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:34,158
like I obviously I got involved in this

627
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:36,839
originally to make money but then just

628
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:38,600
obviously fell in love with the plant um

629
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:39,959
we actually had like a really big

630
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:41,119
breakthrough well there's a couple

631
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:43,720
things that I really wanted to talk

632
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:47,239
about I think the biggest breakthrough

633
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:49,600
is the UVC and using it as a pesticide

634
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:52,120
because um well in all my years of

635
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:54,319
growing we've broken the rules by just

636
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:56,278
using a little small amount of light

637
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:58,519
with a small amount of wattage for a

638
00:28:56,278 --> 00:29:00,319
short period of time and we we've

639
00:28:58,519 --> 00:29:02,919
developed a way to be able to completely

640
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:05,480
just eliminate the need for predator

641
00:29:02,919 --> 00:29:07,880
bugs and pesticides when you're to deal

642
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:09,880
with thrips and other um pests that

643
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:11,360
we're still working on so it's been

644
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:13,360
really really exciting another thing

645
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:16,519
that's like just absolutely huge that's

646
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:18,398
uh changing growing for everybody is

647
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:21,558
under canopy lighting and it's been

648
00:29:18,398 --> 00:29:23,918
highly debated for years and um I

649
00:29:21,558 --> 00:29:26,519
actually you know two years ago had

650
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:28,320
designed an inter canopy light where it

651
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:30,000
kind of goes in the middle of your canop

652
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:32,439
and it's kind of like a low wattage and

653
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,240
then I we just did not see really good

654
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:35,960
data or anything and then I saw other

655
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:39,000
clients of ours using under canopy

656
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:43,079
lighting and having stupid results when

657
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:46,079
I say stupid we're talking 30 to 40%

658
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:48,879
gains and not not only that at the same

659
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:51,558
time eliminating all your be Buds and

660
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,559
all the color differences so um it's

661
00:29:51,558 --> 00:29:55,480
pretty exciting and a lot of people have

662
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:57,359
been making this argument about oh it

663
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:59,399
doesn't line up with the science well

664
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:01,798
the science of it is the light is

665
00:29:59,398 --> 00:30:04,518
actually going through the leave and the

666
00:30:01,798 --> 00:30:05,798
leaves and being caught um that's the

667
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:08,319
only thing that makes sense because

668
00:30:05,798 --> 00:30:10,038
we've just seen incredible um results so

669
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:12,000
that's one thing that's just um we've

670
00:30:10,038 --> 00:30:13,839
just kind of finished developing too and

671
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,640
just kind of exciting seeing what's been

672
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:18,079
happening with the um because it's

673
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:20,240
really changing um the game and just

674
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:21,678
it's so hard like uh like I've been

675
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,159
seeing for some of the people like it

676
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:25,360
depending on where you're producing I

677
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:27,000
know well Michigan we've just set up

678
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:29,079
shop in Michigan oursel and it's cuz

679
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,839
it's so much cheaper to operate and real

680
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:32,558
estate is so much cheaper over there

681
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:34,158
than California like when I was seeing

682
00:30:32,558 --> 00:30:37,079
the cost of what people are having to

683
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:40,080
deal with and operating in California it

684
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:41,359
is insane like I thought we had it bad

685
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:44,519
here in

686
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:48,038
Canada like the California rent and just

687
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:51,440
the cost of everything it is

688
00:30:48,038 --> 00:30:53,278
insane seriously how it's it's so many

689
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:56,480
of my friends that have I mean I I'm

690
00:30:53,278 --> 00:30:58,798
sure move and Wade have a bigger list

691
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,558
but uh just lots of people dropped out

692
00:30:58,798 --> 00:31:03,558
dropped off they just were like [ __ ] I

693
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:07,000
can't [ __ ] with this this is absolutely

694
00:31:03,558 --> 00:31:08,678
impossible yeah yeah like scenes people

695
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:12,119
paying

696
00:31:08,679 --> 00:31:14,080
$37,000 a month rent at like un certain

697
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:17,839
places and these

698
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:19,599
$20,000 um bills like it just I it just

699
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:21,319
it would be so hard to operate I just

700
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:23,240
can only imagine just seeing the and

701
00:31:21,319 --> 00:31:25,960
some of the red tape like Canada has

702
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:27,960
some really disgustingly bad red tape

703
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:29,840
especially like but it's gotten EAS

704
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:32,679
easier to do things like it's so much

705
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:35,519
easier to become it has yeah like five

706
00:31:32,679 --> 00:31:38,080
years ago becoming an LP took like

707
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:39,960
millions of dollars like you need almost

708
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:44,119
needed like $5 million do liquid cash

709
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:46,558
five years ago to do it you did yeah

710
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:48,319
absolutely did we we rented our facility

711
00:31:46,558 --> 00:31:49,759
my partners rented the facility before

712
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:51,079
they brought me on to the company and I

713
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:54,278
was like I came and looked at the

714
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:57,199
facility it's 45,000 square feet three

715
00:31:54,278 --> 00:31:59,200
stories this just gigantic building I'm

716
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:01,639
like how much are you paying for rent

717
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:04,080
they're like oh it's like 60 Grand I'm

718
00:32:01,638 --> 00:32:07,479
like $60,000 for

719
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:09,000
rent then because there was a cannabis

720
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:11,240
shop right down the street from us

721
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,638
called zenabis we figured well this is a

722
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:16,240
no no problem like we'll be able to get

723
00:32:13,638 --> 00:32:18,278
in all day long we got licensing came

724
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:22,319
fast from the government within reason

725
00:32:18,278 --> 00:32:24,919
like six months fast but the city of

726
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:27,960
Delta decided that they were going to do

727
00:32:24,919 --> 00:32:29,679
a caseby case study on each company

728
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:31,558
wanted to bring cannabis to their to

729
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:33,440
their City because they were convinced

730
00:32:31,558 --> 00:32:35,359
that what we were really going to do is

731
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,519
take the Cannabis out of the facility

732
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:40,439
and go down to the high schools and sell

733
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:43,000
it for $358 this was the mentality of

734
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:45,038
these people and it cost us an enormous

735
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:49,319
amount of money because they didn't give

736
00:32:45,038 --> 00:32:53,119
us the um you know the their okay for us

737
00:32:49,319 --> 00:32:56,918
to put a cannabis company in that

738
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:58,599
building for almost two years paying

739
00:32:56,919 --> 00:33:01,440
60,000

740
00:32:58,599 --> 00:33:03,879
a month rent if you can imagine Thomas

741
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:06,679
how how's that for a Burn It To The

742
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:08,840
Ground like what are we doing here guys

743
00:33:06,679 --> 00:33:11,519
like oh my God I was so naive I just

744
00:33:08,839 --> 00:33:14,319
thought as long as I make cash we should

745
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:16,558
be okay as long as every day I've just

746
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:19,798
got the equipment operating and making

747
00:33:16,558 --> 00:33:22,240
hash we should be okay in the end that

748
00:33:19,798 --> 00:33:26,079
company was not okay they flailed it

749
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:28,638
[ __ ] it right into um uh

750
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:31,599
bankruptcy but it still exist this my

751
00:33:28,638 --> 00:33:34,158
new partners we have no debt we have you

752
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:36,678
know no equipment debt no CRA debt no

753
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:39,720
partnership debt the company is a

754
00:33:36,679 --> 00:33:41,278
unicorn in Canada for processing now we

755
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:44,240
still have the same facility it's just

756
00:33:41,278 --> 00:33:46,200
on one floor of the three stories uh all

757
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,440
the equipment's paid off and we're full

758
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:51,480
up with you know rosin presses from

759
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:53,880
sasquash 55 tons we've got the [ __ ]

760
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:56,798
Creek filtration electr plasmatic dry

761
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:58,480
sifting unit we have the Whistler 300 uh

762
00:33:56,798 --> 00:34:01,879
wt300

763
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:03,919
uh washing equipment uh we have a ton of

764
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:06,679
well not a ton but like three XL

765
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:09,240
resonators with a walk-in freezer so we

766
00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:12,398
have the abilities to get a lot of stuff

767
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:15,358
done uh without those crucial mistakes

768
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:18,000
that were made by early companies and uh

769
00:34:15,358 --> 00:34:20,000
wow did we ever see it a lot in Canada

770
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,599
and you got to think like that's that's

771
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,760
people's money you know that's not just

772
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:27,320
like some dude like burning It To The

773
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:29,919
Ground cuz he's incompetent that's like

774
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:31,800
it's an entire team of people all from

775
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:34,358
what I saw and it's not like they were

776
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:38,039
all terrible people it just seemed

777
00:34:34,358 --> 00:34:40,199
like they were coming from Corporate

778
00:34:38,039 --> 00:34:42,000
America or cor corporate North America

779
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:44,078
because they were all Canadians and

780
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,800
bringing all the things that they

781
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:47,079
learned the marketing people were like

782
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,839
we're going to bring all the things we

783
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:51,399
learned at marketing school it's like I

784
00:34:48,838 --> 00:34:53,519
would try to tell them you can't it

785
00:34:51,398 --> 00:34:56,199
won't work that way it won't come across

786
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:57,920
as authentic you actually have to you're

787
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:59,598
going to have to start a new which your

788
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,880
knowledge this is an opportunity for you

789
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:04,519
to Pioneer something you can take the

790
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:06,480
Little Gems that you brought from your

791
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:08,519
education but what you're going to need

792
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,960
to do is you're going to need to shift

793
00:35:08,519 --> 00:35:14,079
your perspectives and

794
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:15,880
apply something new and novel to how you

795
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:17,560
bring this to the market and I've seen

796
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:20,880
little bits of it happen but for the

797
00:35:17,559 --> 00:35:23,279
most part there's highly regulated rules

798
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:25,240
that say you know this is what your

799
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:28,359
package can look like you know in

800
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:30,239
America it looks so much nicer but in

801
00:35:28,358 --> 00:35:32,440
Canada that's what you get you know this

802
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:34,919
is a totally different product totally

803
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:38,679
different product in Canada look at that

804
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:40,039
can you imagine like that is insane

805
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:42,199
people go into stores they don't

806
00:35:40,039 --> 00:35:43,880
recognize the products at all they're

807
00:35:42,199 --> 00:35:45,639
kind of like so they're still we're not

808
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:47,920
under prohibition the same way as we

809
00:35:45,639 --> 00:35:50,039
were but they're still stifling they're

810
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:52,159
still like let's see what key like I

811
00:35:50,039 --> 00:35:54,039
swear they must have had a think tank of

812
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:56,159
brilliant people because they could not

813
00:35:54,039 --> 00:35:59,279
have accidentally [ __ ] this up this

814
00:35:56,159 --> 00:36:01,279
bad this absolutely Ely has to be on on

815
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,880
purpose I'm not a paranoid delusional

816
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:05,359
person I'm just saying that these people

817
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:07,358
government officials and the people that

818
00:36:05,358 --> 00:36:09,400
are passing these regulations really

819
00:36:07,358 --> 00:36:11,679
don't Health Canada less than two years

820
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:15,318
ago in Canada said we still believe

821
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:18,078
there's no medical uh factors no medical

822
00:36:15,318 --> 00:36:19,559
aspects of cannabis in any way uh while

823
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:21,359
interacting with the human body like

824
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:24,318
they made a statement even though they

825
00:36:21,358 --> 00:36:27,119
have a medical platform all across one

826
00:36:24,318 --> 00:36:28,519
of the only Federal Medical Platforms in

827
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:31,720
the whole world you know one of the

828
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:34,280
first and yet um they still don't

829
00:36:31,719 --> 00:36:36,318
acknowledge it so I don't know I'm

830
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:40,400
rambling sorry about that guys probably

831
00:36:36,318 --> 00:36:42,679
need another dab I was oh go on sorry I

832
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,599
was just gonna say that you know that's

833
00:36:42,679 --> 00:36:47,199
like in California California is like

834
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:50,318
the fifth largest economy in the world

835
00:36:47,199 --> 00:36:53,358
agriculture is a huge component of their

836
00:36:50,318 --> 00:36:56,199
of the economy here we've had we have a

837
00:36:53,358 --> 00:36:59,119
serious Heritage Legacy with cannabis

838
00:36:56,199 --> 00:37:01,199
you know the story The worldwide story

839
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:03,079
and California dropped the ball and it's

840
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:06,358
almost like it's impossible to think

841
00:37:03,079 --> 00:37:08,079
they dropped the ball that much you know

842
00:37:06,358 --> 00:37:10,519
like and I'm not a conspiracy person at

843
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:13,160
all and but I think it is a weird it's

844
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:15,119
it's super [ __ ] complicated you know

845
00:37:13,159 --> 00:37:19,639
and I do get that that nobody really

846
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:22,000
understood what to do um but I think

847
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:23,159
your point about the the the leadership

848
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,719
that we

849
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:28,159
didn't there was no like I have this

850
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:30,399
like you think of company like uh a car

851
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:32,679
company or some invention it starts with

852
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:34,800
like the founder it builds it becomes

853
00:37:32,679 --> 00:37:37,358
bigger and bigger and then it becomes a

854
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:39,720
giant industry and then maybe someone

855
00:37:37,358 --> 00:37:42,039
else takes it over like the outside

856
00:37:39,719 --> 00:37:44,439
influence like you could build a you

857
00:37:42,039 --> 00:37:46,358
could build a manufacturing company and

858
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:48,760
then 30 years later you're super

859
00:37:46,358 --> 00:37:51,239
successful and your new CEO is from

860
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:53,720
insurance or entertainment or whatever

861
00:37:51,239 --> 00:37:56,919
or the CFO so you bring in this other

862
00:37:53,719 --> 00:37:58,719
guy but we as an industry we brought in

863
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:01,880
that guy from the beginning as soon as

864
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:03,838
we transitioned all the leadership

865
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:06,200
across the board was like oh we need

866
00:38:03,838 --> 00:38:08,679
business specialist guys we need people

867
00:38:06,199 --> 00:38:11,679
who know how to do business but none of

868
00:38:08,679 --> 00:38:13,838
them were Ground Up cannabis people none

869
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:16,199
of them understood cannabis a lot of

870
00:38:13,838 --> 00:38:20,679
them made really bad decisions and

871
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:24,159
influen policy in a big way and no

872
00:38:20,679 --> 00:38:25,679
one no one really predicted what no one

873
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:27,960
ever thought what would happen if

874
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:30,960
prohibition didn't exist

875
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:33,199
and what is cannabis really worth what's

876
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:35,679
the real value of cannabis not just to

877
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:38,519
people as a as a medicine but the

878
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:40,440
commodity to the farmer the manufacturer

879
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:43,679
the distributor nobody thought like

880
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:45,280
what's a real number and and if that's

881
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:47,679
the real number then that's the number

882
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:50,440
we're all headed towards and if we're

883
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:52,399
all headed towards that number then how

884
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:55,440
do we transition from where right now

885
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:59,358
it's 3,000 bucks a pound but it should

886
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:01,280
probably be 100 or 200 bucks a pound and

887
00:38:59,358 --> 00:39:02,719
you're paying $8 a square foot for

888
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,960
cultivation

889
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:06,399
facility it's like that's not right the

890
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,880
the state shouldn't have allowed that

891
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,280
because and then you're paying a half a

892
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:12,680
million dollars for a license and

893
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:14,960
spending $80,000 a month on rent and

894
00:39:12,679 --> 00:39:17,078
like the state the a state should have

895
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:19,639
like had the foresight to say look in

896
00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:21,839
order to transition out of prohibition

897
00:39:19,639 --> 00:39:24,799
we got to be realistic with people about

898
00:39:21,838 --> 00:39:26,199
what their opportunities are and they

899
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,079
because everyone everyone wanted to

900
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:30,480
transition out of proh

901
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:33,480
and not have jail anymore but nobody

902
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:34,960
wanted to let that prohibition dollar go

903
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:36,358
you know that prohibition dollar the

904
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,720
people came in they were like all right

905
00:39:36,358 --> 00:39:39,559
we're going to legalize this we're going

906
00:39:37,719 --> 00:39:41,639
to change everything oh wait a minute

907
00:39:39,559 --> 00:39:44,279
Bill uh let's not change the prohibition

908
00:39:41,639 --> 00:39:47,639
dollar it used to make sense getting you

909
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:51,400
know say $3,000 a pound which is like

910
00:39:47,639 --> 00:39:53,318
4500 Canadian that is like we're growing

911
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:56,760
it for like you know in the 90s maybe

912
00:39:53,318 --> 00:39:59,519
2000s you know 1500 so the profit margin

913
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:02,640
of we from Canada to America was just

914
00:39:59,519 --> 00:40:04,599
astronomical now it was that way because

915
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:07,239
if you got caught depending on the state

916
00:40:04,599 --> 00:40:10,359
you were probably doing like a five or a

917
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:12,799
10 year sentence depending on where you

918
00:40:10,358 --> 00:40:14,119
got caught the higher the the the money

919
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,839
amount like if you're going down to

920
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:18,440
Arkansas and getting 6,200 well you're

921
00:40:16,838 --> 00:40:20,838
definitely doing the 10 if you get

922
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:24,480
caught like even with like a zip let

923
00:40:20,838 --> 00:40:26,519
alone you know a 100 pounds so it made

924
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,079
sense in the in a sense it didn't really

925
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:31,199
but it made sense in in the sense that

926
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:34,240
this horrific jail sentence was the

927
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:35,838
reward or the the anti-reward you know

928
00:40:34,239 --> 00:40:38,519
of making this enormous amount of money

929
00:40:35,838 --> 00:40:41,039
they got rid of the jail sentence and

930
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:44,119
then suddenly the they wanted to keep

931
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:46,719
the same prices right the algorithm the

932
00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:48,358
algorithm changed and and the funny

933
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:50,959
thing is the corporate guys who first

934
00:40:48,358 --> 00:40:53,920
the first Rush the first wave they were

935
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:56,079
chasing that prohibition dollar because

936
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:58,000
they didn't come from a they weren't a

937
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:59,760
tech people they weren't people who were

938
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,119
ethnobotanists they didn't really

939
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,280
understand cannabis so they were like oh

940
00:41:02,119 --> 00:41:05,680
[ __ ] man there's a lot of money to be

941
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:10,040
made even if it's 500 bucks a pound

942
00:41:05,679 --> 00:41:12,279
we're still making crazy money and now

943
00:41:10,039 --> 00:41:13,239
the can costs more than what's inside

944
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:16,040
the

945
00:41:13,239 --> 00:41:18,279
can dude how about even crazier I'll

946
00:41:16,039 --> 00:41:20,880
I'll step it up for you when I go to

947
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:22,599
Cannabis stores and I try to explain to

948
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:24,079
everyone cuz all the corporate people

949
00:41:22,599 --> 00:41:26,599
want the same thing they're like we need

950
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:29,039
to stabilize and Shelf ready these

951
00:41:26,599 --> 00:41:33,240
products I'm like oh you want us to take

952
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:35,079
a volatile compounds and stabilize them

953
00:41:33,239 --> 00:41:36,719
for the Shelf all right well that I

954
00:41:35,079 --> 00:41:39,839
don't know a ton about a ton but that

955
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:41,358
sounds very difficult um that's what

956
00:41:39,838 --> 00:41:43,440
they want to do they want to stabilize

957
00:41:41,358 --> 00:41:46,598
it then what do they do you go to the

958
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:50,280
stores and the only thing that is being

959
00:41:46,599 --> 00:41:52,960
made cold are 10 milligram shots of

960
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:55,920
distillate nanoemulsified into a

961
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:57,800
beverage in a little can sitting in the

962
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:59,280
fridge and I'm like looking at all the

963
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,920
hash at room temperature I'm looking at

964
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:03,599
all the weed I'm trying to explain to

965
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:05,838
them that all of your volatile compounds

966
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:07,800
they're they're they're they're boiling

967
00:42:05,838 --> 00:42:10,039
right now at room temperature and

968
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:13,359
they're oh yeah the Vault smells amazing

969
00:42:10,039 --> 00:42:15,599
I'm like no no the and the companies are

970
00:42:13,358 --> 00:42:17,199
so new that they've gone so big so fast

971
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:19,440
that they're not growing exceptional

972
00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:22,358
cannabis yet some are some are doing a a

973
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:25,079
great job but many are not so already

974
00:42:22,358 --> 00:42:27,400
you have the disadvantage of the the

975
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:30,119
volatile organic compounds are already

976
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:32,200
in smaller amounts than they would have

977
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:33,960
been had they been grown more properly

978
00:42:32,199 --> 00:42:36,439
by better people under better conditions

979
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:38,838
with better cultivars and and now

980
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:42,639
they're boiling those off it's like dude

981
00:42:38,838 --> 00:42:45,318
it's only 1.5% as it is by the time the

982
00:42:42,639 --> 00:42:47,879
guy gets it and he it's dry and the

983
00:42:45,318 --> 00:42:50,480
Tarpin and all these beautiful volatiles

984
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:52,119
have have boiled off it's not the same

985
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,679
experience and that's that's where you

986
00:42:52,119 --> 00:42:56,240
get people being a little bit

987
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:58,279
disgruntled with uh with their purchase

988
00:42:56,239 --> 00:43:00,399
it's come a long way Canada I will say

989
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:02,680
there's a lot more companies that are

990
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:04,599
sort of on the par for you know

991
00:43:02,679 --> 00:43:06,078
producing nice things people from the

992
00:43:04,599 --> 00:43:08,280
the black and gray Market that have

993
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:10,839
transitioned over and understand that

994
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:13,640
growing smaller Amounts is probably a

995
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:16,000
better idea uh than trying to grow you

996
00:43:13,639 --> 00:43:20,199
know a million square feet when the only

997
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,199
thing you've ever grown is [ __ ]

998
00:43:21,358 --> 00:43:26,519
chickpeas you know we were talking about

999
00:43:24,199 --> 00:43:29,078
um just about government screwing things

1000
00:43:26,519 --> 00:43:32,000
up it's crazy to see what's happening in

1001
00:43:29,079 --> 00:43:34,318
Germany right now like boy if they like

1002
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,079
they have just really screwed everything

1003
00:43:34,318 --> 00:43:38,719
up where I I think they're basically

1004
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:42,680
limitating or limitating people to only

1005
00:43:38,719 --> 00:43:45,039
able to do like 55 light shows I forget

1006
00:43:42,679 --> 00:43:47,159
how many people they can do it for so

1007
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:49,119
then you have to extend groups I we've

1008
00:43:47,159 --> 00:43:51,639
been talking with multiple people out

1009
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:53,838
there and it just just sounds like such

1010
00:43:51,639 --> 00:43:56,000
a headache and just such a bad idea a

1011
00:43:53,838 --> 00:43:57,759
bunch of real bad ideas that aren't

1012
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,280
going to be sustainable

1013
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,880
who would have thought that the Germans

1014
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,800
would come up with a bureaucratic

1015
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:05,000
nightmare for cannabis like I would have

1016
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:08,039
never

1017
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:11,358
thought so weird it's like a weird it's

1018
00:44:08,039 --> 00:44:14,079
like a it's like a a Spain weird hash

1019
00:44:11,358 --> 00:44:15,358
it's like a club membership based thing

1020
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:19,079
that's what they want to do in Germany

1021
00:44:15,358 --> 00:44:20,880
exactly a quota base perk patient it's

1022
00:44:19,079 --> 00:44:23,480
it's impossible for any businesses to

1023
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:25,119
make money really but they're like I

1024
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:26,599
think the logic was like well we'll

1025
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:28,440
figure out a way for you guys to smoke

1026
00:44:26,599 --> 00:44:30,599
weed but no one gets to make money off

1027
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:32,960
it yet

1028
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:36,079
exactly they they figured it out they

1029
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:37,800
figure it out to make it be like if you

1030
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:40,960
do the numbers and I can't remember the

1031
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:43,318
exact numbers it's like five Keys a

1032
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:44,679
month or something or some small amount

1033
00:44:43,318 --> 00:44:46,558
if you do the math you're allowed to

1034
00:44:44,679 --> 00:44:47,879
have a certain amount of members 200

1035
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:50,800
members or something they're allowed to

1036
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:54,119
buy a maximum amount of cannabis twice a

1037
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:55,680
month and if you do the max numbers and

1038
00:44:54,119 --> 00:44:57,680
all of those guys are buying then it's

1039
00:44:55,679 --> 00:45:00,399
like okay this is an okay little

1040
00:44:57,679 --> 00:45:02,279
business but the problem is is unless

1041
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:03,680
you're producing great cannabis they're

1042
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:05,200
going to be a part of other groups

1043
00:45:03,679 --> 00:45:07,239
they're going to get cannabis from a

1044
00:45:05,199 --> 00:45:10,000
multitude of places it'll dilute your

1045
00:45:07,239 --> 00:45:13,199
sales you won't be selling 100% And your

1046
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,760
number is already small it seems like uh

1047
00:45:13,199 --> 00:45:16,558
and then they're all they're all

1048
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:18,440
investing in their own grows which from

1049
00:45:16,559 --> 00:45:20,760
you know The Grandmaster LED perspective

1050
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:22,679
is like woohoo like instead of just like

1051
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:24,480
a bunch of big companies coming in it's

1052
00:45:22,679 --> 00:45:27,598
literally going to be like I think they

1053
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:29,719
put the cap at 10,000 and I I could be

1054
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:31,359
wrong but I thought I heard when we were

1055
00:45:29,719 --> 00:45:35,719
in Berlin that they're going to allow

1056
00:45:31,358 --> 00:45:38,039
10,000 private clubs uh throughout

1057
00:45:35,719 --> 00:45:39,639
Germany yeah be be growing their own

1058
00:45:38,039 --> 00:45:42,039
weed processing their own house and

1059
00:45:39,639 --> 00:45:45,000
selling it to their own private members

1060
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:46,519
that's uh that's a lot of work I don't

1061
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:49,079
think 10,000 people are going to find

1062
00:45:46,519 --> 00:45:49,079
success in

1063
00:45:49,519 --> 00:45:53,880
that

1064
00:45:51,519 --> 00:45:56,119
yeah all right I want you all taking a

1065
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:59,039
dab right now and I want Brian to tell

1066
00:45:56,119 --> 00:46:00,800
me about what his best hash Dash rosin

1067
00:45:59,039 --> 00:46:03,000
is that he's that he's growing and

1068
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:07,640
smoking right now because I I miss your

1069
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:12,039
deep radio voice describing in detail

1070
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:13,719
rosins and hashes I do man I miss that I

1071
00:46:12,039 --> 00:46:17,119
grabbed a couple just in case we're

1072
00:46:13,719 --> 00:46:20,598
talking about that kind of thing yeah I

1073
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:23,838
got awesome this is Rosen form but this

1074
00:46:20,599 --> 00:46:28,599
is some lime peels I'm calling it and my

1075
00:46:23,838 --> 00:46:30,480
friend uh Jacob habash friend bred this

1076
00:46:28,599 --> 00:46:32,519
yeah I shared some breeding technique in

1077
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:34,800
my last year out in Humble which was

1078
00:46:32,519 --> 00:46:37,679
eight years ago we worked together in

1079
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:40,960
the field and he sent me some seeds he

1080
00:46:37,679 --> 00:46:45,440
made a couple years back and this was a

1081
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:47,559
lemon peel by uh lemon peel again on on

1082
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:50,000
ghost train banana sherbet by

1083
00:46:47,559 --> 00:46:52,359
zace that like really creative he made

1084
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,280
and it's super duper loud like can't

1085
00:46:52,358 --> 00:46:55,960
wait to share it with him back but

1086
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:58,000
anyway there's a look it's hard to smell

1087
00:46:55,960 --> 00:47:02,358
through the computer but it's definitely

1088
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:04,679
like you stepped on some like gassy lime

1089
00:47:02,358 --> 00:47:06,519
Peels and it's right in your face and

1090
00:47:04,679 --> 00:47:08,519
the taste is almost louder than the

1091
00:47:06,519 --> 00:47:12,480
smell on this one like the translation

1092
00:47:08,519 --> 00:47:15,119
is almost overboard out of your ears on

1093
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:16,318
the taste that even from the smell so

1094
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:18,960
I'm liking this one it's got a really

1095
00:47:16,318 --> 00:47:22,159
good sativa kick too in that profile the

1096
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:25,920
lemon G on the I95 shines in this

1097
00:47:22,159 --> 00:47:27,558
one F yeah dude that's what I'm saying

1098
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:30,000
yeah so I'm liking that one I stick to

1099
00:47:27,559 --> 00:47:32,760
my gas mask heavy and then I just did

1100
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:35,119
finish um well breeding and working with

1101
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:37,760
my new 207 headband kind of threw back

1102
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:39,880
to the old East Coast headband clone I

1103
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:42,880
came into when I was first moving back

1104
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:46,160
here so I'm kind of on the gas ticket as

1105
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:47,760
usual but working with some I got a

1106
00:47:46,159 --> 00:47:49,799
whole list of interesting new ones

1107
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:52,400
coming up to talk about when the time's

1108
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:54,039
right but I'm excited I hear I want to

1109
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:57,480
hear about every one of them for sure

1110
00:47:54,039 --> 00:47:59,400
once you holding the jar in your hand ah

1111
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:01,358
well I got a few new ones I'm turning

1112
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:03,400
that is I got a strawberry headband I

1113
00:48:01,358 --> 00:48:05,000
made from my strawberry Midas into the

1114
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:07,639
headband clone I call Strawberry

1115
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:10,960
headband and I crossed that into the gas

1116
00:48:07,639 --> 00:48:13,000
mask for a strawberry gas mask I did I

1117
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:15,240
also am like checking fenos outside on

1118
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:17,679
these projects right now and seeing

1119
00:48:15,239 --> 00:48:21,239
which ones shine which ones keep or make

1120
00:48:17,679 --> 00:48:23,118
it and I've got a like the strawberry

1121
00:48:21,239 --> 00:48:24,598
headband lines into some different

1122
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:26,440
things because it just shines so well

1123
00:48:24,599 --> 00:48:27,640
outside last year is actually most of

1124
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:30,159
that

1125
00:48:27,639 --> 00:48:32,960
and I did a sour banana sherbet on the

1126
00:48:30,159 --> 00:48:35,558
strawberry headband for like a straw

1127
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:38,119
Nana band type of thing like an you know

1128
00:48:35,559 --> 00:48:40,119
contemporary straw nana I got that

1129
00:48:38,119 --> 00:48:41,680
Citrus smoothie which is the comes

1130
00:48:40,119 --> 00:48:43,599
that's what the lime peels I Nam the

1131
00:48:41,679 --> 00:48:46,519
feno but it's actually his creation is

1132
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:49,280
called Citrus smoothie Jacob the habash

1133
00:48:46,519 --> 00:48:51,400

1135
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:56,480
G profile on me like the the lemon peel

1136
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:59,079
profile so I'm working those out in the

1137
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:00,599
yard I seem to see like we talked about

1138
00:48:59,079 --> 00:49:02,798
this I think a couple few years ago but

1139
00:49:00,599 --> 00:49:06,640
I see a really good resistance kick on

1140
00:49:02,798 --> 00:49:09,798
the lemon or the lemon tpine out into

1141
00:49:06,639 --> 00:49:13,279
Maine um as far as like Health carry

1142
00:49:09,798 --> 00:49:16,000
through the season but yeah so I got

1143
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:17,720
some different interesting gas mask on

1144
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,480
GMO is a new one that I'm really working

1145
00:49:17,719 --> 00:49:22,318
with calling

1146
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:25,358

time we wash it we'll we'll do the same

1154
00:49:38,358 --> 00:49:43,480
but um yeah I could go on and on and on

1155
00:49:41,318 --> 00:49:46,318
there's all kinds of that love for the

1156
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:48,039
for the strain work and just trying to

1157

you know I I just love how you

1158

1159
00:49:50,679 --> 00:49:55,679
and hear the passion in it and you can

00:49:55,679 --> 00:50:01,118
grown and touched and like experienced

1162
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:04,720
the expression of this plant he's also

1163
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:08,200
like processed it and and and dabbed it

1164
00:50:04,719 --> 00:50:10,118
out on all levels and and you're able to

1165
00:50:08,199 --> 00:50:13,879

1168
00:50:16,719 --> 00:50:22,598
the East Coast um

1169
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:25,519
headband I have a I have a a kind of

1170
00:50:22,599 --> 00:50:27,280
strange relationship with headband um

1171
00:50:25,519 --> 00:50:30,559
just real quick

1172
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:32,519
um my uh good friend I think he's known

1173
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:35,200
in this in the on the social media as

1174
00:50:32,519 --> 00:50:36,838
Manny in the whole story of Sour Diesel

1175
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:39,239
he was the guy who put the seed in the

1176
00:50:36,838 --> 00:50:41,639
ground but in the pot he wasn't the you

1177
00:50:39,239 --> 00:50:43,239
know it's a long story but he he's a

1178
00:50:41,639 --> 00:50:47,679
close friend of mine and when he came

1179
00:50:43,239 --> 00:50:52,159
out to um the West Coast in the late

1180
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:55,919
90s um I did a swap with him with Sour

1181
00:50:52,159 --> 00:50:57,960
Diesel and kush before it was called OG

1182
00:50:55,920 --> 00:51:00,358
um so we did a bet trade and I gave the

1183
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:02,199
OG guys the sour for the first time and

1184
00:51:00,358 --> 00:51:06,000
I gave the sour guys the OG for the

1185
00:51:02,199 --> 00:51:08,759
first time and long story crazy story

1186
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:11,760
short but when he was up in the Bay Area

1187
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:15,520
707 at first he was up in in mindo area

1188
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:19,839
but when he was in somoma um I told him

1189
00:51:15,519 --> 00:51:22,239
not to I suggested not calling the OG OG

1190
00:51:19,838 --> 00:51:25,599
okay call it Kush because it was a weird

1191
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:27,598
a weird time in the scene you know and

1192
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:29,280
not that many people that cut at the

1193
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:31,200
time and it was just a little bit

1194
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:34,519
volatile and just the weird money

1195
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:38,118
element around it anyway he called it

1196
00:51:34,519 --> 00:51:40,599
headband okay and that's where the 707

1197
00:51:38,119 --> 00:51:43,400
Headband came from and the whole story

1198
00:51:40,599 --> 00:51:46,440
was that when he back in the east coast

1199
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:49,480
when he was a kid in the 80s you know

1200
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:52,559
late 80s early 90s they used to use the

1201
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:54,480
term headband as a descriptor for like a

1202
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:55,880
certain effect which you know we've all

1203
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:58,240
had you know that rubber band coming off

1204
00:51:55,880 --> 00:52:00,119
your head right yeah but so so the

1205
00:51:58,239 --> 00:52:01,679
question I had to him and I've asked

1206
00:52:00,119 --> 00:52:04,640
this of other people who were on that

1207
00:52:01,679 --> 00:52:07,118
scene back in the day is was there ever

1208
00:52:04,639 --> 00:52:10,960
a real was there ever a

1209
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:13,240
cut ever called headband that survived

1210
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:15,000
through that transition because from

1211
00:52:13,239 --> 00:52:17,838
what I know everything that's called

1212
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:21,599
headband today came from that renaming

1213
00:52:17,838 --> 00:52:23,039
of OG he was selling OG and sour at the

1214
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:25,318
same time and some of it was called

1215
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:27,719
headband and some of it was seated and

1216
00:52:25,318 --> 00:52:29,599
some of it was just OG it was just sour

1217
00:52:27,719 --> 00:52:31,439
so I've always been trying to trace like

1218
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:34,480
if anyone can have an origin of an

1219
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:38,039
original East Coast headband cut that

1220
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:40,480
predates 99 2000 era it's a great part

1221
00:52:38,039 --> 00:52:42,318
of thetive around Kim dog and OG and

1222
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:43,679
stuff I love the story yeah those are

1223
00:52:42,318 --> 00:52:45,318
great pieces you're throwing in right

1224
00:52:43,679 --> 00:52:46,919
there that's the history I think like

1225
00:52:45,318 --> 00:52:48,719
it's none of it's really well it's

1226
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:50,358
written down but none of it's locked in

1227
00:52:48,719 --> 00:52:52,399
you know written into stone where a lot

1228
00:52:50,358 --> 00:52:55,199
of pieces move with the OG story and the

1229
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:58,358
sour diesel story I only really know

1230
00:52:55,199 --> 00:53:00,279
like what my history line with it is and

1231
00:52:58,358 --> 00:53:02,798
um definitely raised up on that real

1232
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:06,519
ecsd cut that I've heard Source back to

1233
00:53:02,798 --> 00:53:08,759
the Albany called such things um this

1234
00:53:06,519 --> 00:53:11,079
had been when I was out west I lived in

1235
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:13,440
in NorCal and did this work medical work

1236
00:53:11,079 --> 00:53:16,200
for 11 years so I got to touch some

1237
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:18,200
really good genetics out there and I I

1238
00:53:16,199 --> 00:53:20,919
did work through a different a batch of

1239
00:53:18,199 --> 00:53:22,480
kushes to get to that true OG cut it was

1240
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:23,960
called out of Southern humble

1241
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:27,358
circulation from

1242
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:30,079
oaksterdam or Oakland area and I really

1243
00:53:27,358 --> 00:53:33,558
love that one and I would say as far as

1244
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:35,680
the headband out west I tried the 707

1245
00:53:33,559 --> 00:53:38,160
and maybe another looma or something a

1246
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:40,318
couple few of them that like my glass

1247
00:53:38,159 --> 00:53:43,440
blower friends up in Arcada were in love

1248
00:53:40,318 --> 00:53:45,318
with that 707 and a couple variations

1249
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:48,039
that were more cush sided out there that

1250
00:53:45,318 --> 00:53:49,639
I noticed definitely more OG sided and

1251
00:53:48,039 --> 00:53:51,039
then when I moved back here I just had a

1252
00:53:49,639 --> 00:53:52,759
friend kind of blessed me with some

1253
00:53:51,039 --> 00:53:55,318
plants when I stepped in doing the first

1254
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:57,760
light dep and there was a Super Lemon

1255
00:53:55,318 --> 00:53:59,480
Haze CL cut that it was amazing and then

1256
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:01,839
there was this headband cut just

1257
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:03,880
reported to me as it moved through the

1258
00:54:01,838 --> 00:54:06,920
lines people shared it it was definitely

1259
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:08,720
like East Coast heavy head band cut that

1260
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:11,680
some people reported to be possibly

1261
00:54:08,719 --> 00:54:14,039
what's termed or original diesel or the

1262
00:54:11,679 --> 00:54:16,199
day wrecker that's been thrown in the

1263
00:54:14,039 --> 00:54:19,000
mix with it which it might be that same

1264
00:54:16,199 --> 00:54:20,679
synonymous same cut and then what I

1265
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:23,639
noticed part of the story as well when I

1266
00:54:20,679 --> 00:54:26,000
first went out west myself in ' 06

1267
00:54:23,639 --> 00:54:27,679
0607 I had a friend from out east doing

1268
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:30,400
workout there that grabbed a cutting

1269
00:54:27,679 --> 00:54:32,558
from Vermont we were in Maine but he

1270
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:35,519
called it all day he called it Eco Sour

1271
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:37,480
Diesel and it was not the Alban C that I

1272
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:41,079
was used to but it was so dank like

1273
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:43,119
peanut butter fudgy thick like not your

1274
00:54:41,079 --> 00:54:45,440
mass Super Skunk as much sided it was

1275
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:48,599
more thick like a Kush thickness to it

1276
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:50,480
versus you know the ecsd and you know

1277
00:54:48,599 --> 00:54:52,240
that was East that was Sour Diesel D

1278
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:54,318
youco Sour Diesel but then I heard other

1279
00:54:52,239 --> 00:54:56,439
people out there when I was in working

1280
00:54:54,318 --> 00:54:58,279
in the you know the Santa Ros sonomi

1281
00:54:56,440 --> 00:55:00,079
area was some actually a market like a

1282
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:02,319
farmers market and such some people had

1283
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:04,400
some clones and some medicine or some

1284
00:55:02,318 --> 00:55:07,039
flour of it and some people termed it

1285
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:08,880
the mistress cut I don't know if you've

1286
00:55:07,039 --> 00:55:11,079
heard that one thrown around out there

1287
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:14,519
like the the sour diesel you cheat on

1288
00:55:11,079 --> 00:55:17,359
your other Sour Diesel with yeah yeah

1289
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:19,480
yeah God there could be another story

1290
00:55:17,358 --> 00:55:22,519
attached to the mistress cut but that's

1291
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:24,599
that that's maybe getting a little

1292
00:55:22,519 --> 00:55:27,599
too no but that's a really interesting

1293
00:55:24,599 --> 00:55:31,240
story because um I think so the first

1294
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:34,119
time I showed these guys the the OG

1295
00:55:31,239 --> 00:55:36,519
around 98 99 they took a look at it and

1296
00:55:34,119 --> 00:55:39,280
go that's the diesel where'd you get

1297
00:55:36,519 --> 00:55:40,759
diesel and and and I I mean like and

1298
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:42,359

1300
00:55:42,358 --> 00:55:46,759

1301
00:55:45,039 --> 00:55:48,520
Diesel's just sour Kim and then they

1302
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:50,720
just Chang it to diesel because diesel

1303
00:55:48,519 --> 00:55:52,759
was a popular you know so did you did

1304
00:55:50,719 --> 00:55:54,199
you hear this you'd be one I think I can

1305
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:57,079
ask about because you have some of this

1306
00:55:54,199 --> 00:55:58,598
folklore the story

1307
00:55:57,079 --> 00:56:02,920
my friends that circulated around the

1308
00:55:58,599 --> 00:56:05,599
first early cuting like oh 99 2000 even

1309
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:07,200
2001 that came around for us back then

1310
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:08,920
um years later when I came back a friend

1311
00:56:07,199 --> 00:56:11,239
of mine said that he had heard the sour

1312
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:12,838
diesel Story coming out of this you know

1313
00:56:11,239 --> 00:56:15,959
the East Coast side actually pertaining

1314
00:56:12,838 --> 00:56:18,318
more to that it was diesel was like a

1315
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:21,119
term like you're saying that referred to

1316
00:56:18,318 --> 00:56:23,440
like strength power it was you know that

1317
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:25,838
Powerhouse right so and then what I

1318
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:28,639
heard is the sour got flipped onto it

1319
00:56:25,838 --> 00:56:31,679
because if you had that real cut of that

1320
00:56:28,639 --> 00:56:34,440
diesel then other Crews were sour over

1321
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:37,879
it have you heard that one a lot well

1322
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:40,720
well that's that's part of yeah that's

1323
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:42,680
that's part of it yeah AJ right yeah

1324
00:56:40,719 --> 00:56:45,639
soured

1325
00:56:42,679 --> 00:56:49,558
relationships yeah but it was originally

1326
00:56:45,639 --> 00:56:53,199
it was the the first seeds were from Kim

1327
00:56:49,559 --> 00:56:55,200
dog and it's unknown male for two two

1328
00:56:53,199 --> 00:56:58,199
generations basically so the whole Mass

1329
00:56:55,199 --> 00:57:00,118
sco super skun side nobody really knows

1330
00:56:58,199 --> 00:57:01,679
but the basically the seeds were as far

1331
00:57:00,119 --> 00:57:05,200
as I remember you know in my memory

1332
00:57:01,679 --> 00:57:07,598
Fades man it ju they were it was our Kim

1333
00:57:05,199 --> 00:57:09,399
on the seed pack on the little film box

1334
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:12,240
and then they put the s in front of our

1335
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:14,119
Kim and then it was Sour Kim and then

1336
00:57:12,239 --> 00:57:16,598
once and then once it because it was Kim

1337
00:57:14,119 --> 00:57:19,280
dog and then once it hit the

1338
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:21,318
market when people started purchasing it

1339
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:23,400
it was like oh it sells we'll sell it as

1352
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:55,079
saw this on some video that the piff

1353
00:57:53,639 --> 00:57:58,318
they called it the piff because the

1354
00:57:55,079 --> 00:58:00,839
Dominican guys that were and Hayes were

1355
00:57:58,318 --> 00:58:02,759
calling it purple it was nl5 Hayes but

1356
00:58:00,838 --> 00:58:05,480
they were calling it purple hay cuz hay

1357
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:07,640
and purple Hayes just were attached and

1358
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:09,679
the guys who are hearing it didn't get

1359
00:58:07,639 --> 00:58:11,239
the accent right I don't know if that's

1360
00:58:09,679 --> 00:58:13,960
just an internet story but I've always

1361
00:58:11,239 --> 00:58:16,719
wondered where the word piff come from

1362
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:16,720
I'd like to know the

1363
00:58:17,199 --> 00:58:25,078
same how to get those Miami guys in

1364
00:58:21,838 --> 00:58:26,798
here they all we called it Haze back in

1365
00:58:25,079 --> 00:58:30,359
the day and then piff came later for me

1366
00:58:26,798 --> 00:58:32,639
actually after I moved back even ago so

1367
00:58:30,358 --> 00:58:34,759
it was always Haze for up us up in in

1368
00:58:32,639 --> 00:58:38,598
Manitoba you know it was that that's

1369
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:40,760
what it was 18 plus weak flower right

1370
00:58:38,599 --> 00:58:45,519
you know big monster plants little tiny

1371
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:48,359
buds just I was so lucky to truly

1372
00:58:45,519 --> 00:58:51,000
that as much of a commercial grower as

1373
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:52,719
my mentor Ron hickey was because he was

1374
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:56,318
just all about like building these like

1375
00:58:52,719 --> 00:58:58,879
secret grows and houses all across he he

1376
00:58:56,318 --> 00:59:01,038
was also um you know one that would be

1377
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:03,760
like let's just grow this it's it's 20

1378
00:59:01,039 --> 00:59:04,960
weeks of flowering and just like people

1379
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:06,640
would be like whoa what are you talking

1380
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:09,318
about Ron like we could Hammer off like

1381
00:59:06,639 --> 00:59:11,719
three crops like we can't we can't do

1382
00:59:09,318 --> 00:59:14,440
that it's like oh we're he'd be like oh

1383
00:59:11,719 --> 00:59:17,519
we're doing it and that weed was just so

1384
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:19,400
spectacular to have that in my history

1385
00:59:17,519 --> 00:59:21,038
of that you know people would come into

1386
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:23,880
the room and they'd be like they think

1387
00:59:21,039 --> 00:59:26,400
it was like perfume like literally just

1388
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:28,559
on their tongues in their mouth down

1389
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:32,920
their throats like what is that

1390
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:34,760
perfumey smell like it's the haze and in

1391
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:37,798
fact this is an amazing thing because my

1392
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:39,960
wife is not a huge proponent of cannabis

1393
00:59:37,798 --> 00:59:42,358
obviously she has an appreciation for

1394
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:46,039
the fact that it's been um funding our

1395
00:59:42,358 --> 00:59:47,838
life uh for the last 35 years um and she

1396
00:59:46,039 --> 00:59:50,480
has her own relationships with wearing

1397
00:59:47,838 --> 00:59:52,318
hemp and CBD and whatnot but uh yeah

1398
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:55,318
just not overly a huge cannabis

1399
00:59:52,318 --> 01:00:01,038
proponent but uh when my first son was

1400
00:59:55,318 --> 01:00:03,159
born and we named him Tosh she suggested

1401
01:00:01,039 --> 01:00:05,079
that we use the name Hayes for his

1402
01:00:03,159 --> 01:00:07,118
middle name which in fact is his name

1403
01:00:05,079 --> 01:00:08,480
he's Tosh Hayes and I just thought that

1404
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:10,480
was such a cool thing and I even asked

1405
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:12,119
her later I was like what made you do

1406
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:14,639
that like what made you say that and

1407
01:00:12,119 --> 01:00:16,480
she's like you would always just get so

1408
01:00:14,639 --> 01:00:18,598
excited about the haze I wanted to

1409
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:20,838
transfer a little bit of that over to to

1410
01:00:18,599 --> 01:00:24,880
our son I was like that's

1411
01:00:20,838 --> 01:00:26,838
amazing the haze it's the haze that's

1412
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:28,960
how excited we would be I you guys know

1413
01:00:26,838 --> 01:00:30,838
I'm sure you were the same my my wife

1414
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:32,960
did the exact same thing with my son

1415
01:00:30,838 --> 01:00:35,199
it's so weird you said that man because

1416
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:37,159
she it was she suggests my son's middle

1417
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:41,159

1462
01:02:19,278 --> 01:02:22,719
he had this apartment that he didn't

1463
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:24,960
really live in but it just held like

1464
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:27,639
boxes of all of his stuff I was always

1467
01:02:30,119 --> 01:02:34,079
can't count the amount of times that I

1468
01:02:31,559 --> 01:02:36,119
would go visit him at that apartment the

1469
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:38,400
old one on the toll Sprout

1470
01:02:36,119 --> 01:02:40,039
there and he would have just gotten back

1471
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:43,160
from somewhere so we'd have all these

1472
01:02:40,039 --> 01:02:45,920
crazy like tools from you know

1473
01:02:43,159 --> 01:02:48,480
harvesting hemp in Vietnam and like

1474
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:52,159
cloths and Beads and like just going

1475
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:54,798
through Rob stuff with Rob uh was uh one

1476
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:56,358
of my coolest memories of hanging out

1477
01:02:54,798 --> 01:02:57,798
and getting to know Rob

1478
01:02:56,358 --> 01:02:59,440
really get to know that guy when you let

1479
01:02:57,798 --> 01:03:02,159
him go through the stuff that he's

1480
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:05,159
collected around the world and sort of

1481
01:03:02,159 --> 01:03:08,038
Express his passion that he has for the

1482
01:03:05,159 --> 01:03:10,519
weaves and the culture and the once

1483
01:03:08,039 --> 01:03:13,319
again I just have uh I'm attracted to

1484
01:03:10,519 --> 01:03:15,199
Passion I really have an attraction to

1485
01:03:13,318 --> 01:03:16,838
Passion it doesn't even have to be

1486
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:20,519
passionate about something that I

1487
01:03:16,838 --> 01:03:22,960
personally love if it's palpable and the

1488
01:03:20,519 --> 01:03:24,480
person is just truly authentic in their

1489
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:27,159
passion for the thing they're sharing

1490
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:28,719
with you it's it's a pretty lovely

1491
01:03:27,159 --> 01:03:31,558
experience I think if more people put

1492
01:03:28,719 --> 01:03:34,480
their phones down in fact uh and hung

1493
01:03:31,559 --> 01:03:37,559
out with people uh just you know next to

1494
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:38,838
each other rather than uh s what what

1495
01:03:37,559 --> 01:03:40,440
what what were you saying here oh did

1496
01:03:38,838 --> 01:03:42,199
you see this you got to check this out

1497
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:46,358
it's like I don't want to check that out

1498
01:03:42,199 --> 01:03:48,558
I want to relax and connect and uh puff

1499
01:03:46,358 --> 01:03:48,558
some

1500
01:03:49,679 --> 01:03:55,078
dabs

1501
01:03:52,239 --> 01:03:57,078
indeed indeed Thomas are you going to

1502
01:03:55,079 --> 01:03:59,480
tell us about the UVC light a little bit

1503
01:03:57,079 --> 01:04:00,760
I feel like we should probably talk

1504
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:04,400
about that a little

1505
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:06,920
bit sure um you know what I think I can

1506
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:08,400
actually let me start it off you you do

1507
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:10,680
what you're GNA do what I'll start off

1508
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:12,760
is how Thomas I've known for a long time

1509
01:04:10,679 --> 01:04:14,440
he's Grandmaster LED he's got popular

1510
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:16,760
YouTube channel he's lots of traction

1511
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:19,000
he's always been doing stuff um but it

1512
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:21,480
was only about a year ago he he was

1513
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:23,119
reaching out to me on Instagram which is

1514
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:25,039
a terrible way to reach out to me for

1515
01:04:23,119 --> 01:04:26,920
anyone that wants to know it's much

1516
01:04:25,039 --> 01:04:30,400
easier to just hit hit me up on my BC

1517
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:32,680
bubbleman at icloud.com you can find it

1518
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:35,559
almost in all my social medias but he

1519
01:04:32,679 --> 01:04:37,519
hit me up on on Instagram and I I get so

1520
01:04:35,559 --> 01:04:39,760
many messages on there I'm not always

1521
01:04:37,519 --> 01:04:40,759
quick and he had sent me maybe three or

1522
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:43,359
four

1523
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:44,799
messages and I hadn't gotten back to him

1524
01:04:43,358 --> 01:04:45,920
he was like I have something the

1525
01:04:44,798 --> 01:04:47,639
messages were like I have something

1526

1527
01:04:47,639 --> 01:04:51,159
it's crazy blah blah blah blah blah I

1528
01:04:49,199 --> 01:04:53,838

1530
01:04:53,838 --> 01:04:58,798
messages in the in the list finally get

1531
01:04:56,278 --> 01:05:02,239
back to him and he's he's like I got

1532
01:04:58,798 --> 01:05:05,880
this light that like uh kills bugs and

1533
01:05:02,239 --> 01:05:08,159
I'm like I'm like okay dude like sure

1534
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:10,720
you do and he starts telling me about

1535
01:05:08,159 --> 01:05:12,838
this UVC light it's listen he got me

1536
01:05:10,719 --> 01:05:14,959
hooked I will admit I had to go and

1537
01:05:12,838 --> 01:05:16,960
photograph the garden that he showed

1538
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:20,000
which was full of I think the first one

1539
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:22,000
he showed was full of thrips and as a

1540
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:23,920
grower I you know I haven't been growing

1541
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:26,199
every day for the last 35 years but I

1542
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:28,200
started growing almost 35 years ago and

1543
01:05:26,199 --> 01:05:30,519
I've grown some crops and I know what it

1544
01:05:28,199 --> 01:05:32,919
looks like when you get bugs and I know

1545
01:05:30,519 --> 01:05:35,358
how devastating it is when the plants

1546
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:38,119
look the way they looked when he showed

1547
01:05:35,358 --> 01:05:40,239
the crop with the thrips and so he

1548
01:05:38,119 --> 01:05:43,039
showed a crop you know the same crop

1549
01:05:40,239 --> 01:05:44,558
later I don't know if it was 30 or 40

1550
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:46,480
days later this was when he really first

1551
01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:48,319
got the light and didn't understand

1552
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:51,119
there's still a lot to learn about this

1553
01:05:48,318 --> 01:05:52,960
light a lot um but he was using it for

1554
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:56,200
very very short intervals it was like

1555
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:58,199
five minutes um a day

1556
01:05:56,199 --> 01:06:01,199
on and it's they're just little five

1557
01:05:58,199 --> 01:06:03,639
watt scrip lights that point up Under

1558
01:06:01,199 --> 01:06:05,838
The Canopy uh and they disrupt these

1559
01:06:03,639 --> 01:06:07,759
bugs in a big way the the the what were

1560
01:06:05,838 --> 01:06:10,759
the other ones the aphids they were like

1561
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:13,559
literally running away go ahead Thomas

1562
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:15,880
yeah absolutely jff can you spotlight or

1563
01:06:13,559 --> 01:06:17,960
spotlighter pin my video here and I'll

1564
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:20,400
hit play yeah let me see how I can do

1565
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:23,358
that um Spotlight for everyone here we

1566
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:25,720
go so this is actually like thrips in my

1567
01:06:23,358 --> 01:06:30,358
own medical Garden on the very first day

1568
01:06:25,719 --> 01:06:32,519
I was testing them out myself um and

1569
01:06:30,358 --> 01:06:34,519
what's like really crazy about this is

1570
01:06:32,519 --> 01:06:38,000
well before I'd even started this we had

1571
01:06:34,519 --> 01:06:41,559
already done tests and been totally

1572
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:45,079
successful so we were taking basically a

1573
01:06:41,559 --> 01:06:47,079
a tent taking just like one plant and

1574
01:06:45,079 --> 01:06:48,760
introducing spider mites we started off

1575
01:06:47,079 --> 01:06:50,359
our very first test were spider mites

1576
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:52,760
where we were introducing five to seven

1577
01:06:50,358 --> 01:06:55,318
mites and within seven days we're

1578
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:57,200
completely beating them like I'm talking

1579
01:06:55,318 --> 01:06:59,400
like at this point I thought okay I can

1580
01:06:57,199 --> 01:07:01,879
beat spider mites and we're also um

1581
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:03,960
beating thrips so this was the fir but

1582
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:06,519
it was only like on an individual plant

1583
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:08,119
with like one or two thrips and or with

1584
01:07:06,519 --> 01:07:09,519
only like five or seven mites so this

1585
01:07:08,119 --> 01:07:12,119
was the first thing where we actually

1586
01:07:09,519 --> 01:07:13,639
have an actual thrip infestation and you

1587
01:07:12,119 --> 01:07:15,798
can see how they're just like bars that

1588
01:07:13,639 --> 01:07:19,078
go underneath your canopy they're only

1589
01:07:15,798 --> 01:07:21,278
five watts each and we were only doing

1590
01:07:19,079 --> 01:07:23,480
five minute just trying to think right

1591
01:07:21,278 --> 01:07:25,559
no at this point we were only doing

1592
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:27,880
that's right five minute treatment so

1593
01:07:25,559 --> 01:07:29,880
this is actually going to jump um 10

1594
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:32,880
days later of doing five minute

1595
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:36,440
treatments and seven or 3 days before

1596
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:38,358
this footage like we have about four or

1597
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:42,318
15 hours worth of footage crammed into

1598
01:07:38,358 --> 01:07:44,119
about 15 minutes here um but three days

1599
01:07:42,318 --> 01:07:46,318
before this I cleaned the bottoms up and

1600
01:07:44,119 --> 01:07:48,119
I moved the lights up and I like I I

1601
01:07:46,318 --> 01:07:50,440
couldn't really find any thrips or thrip

1602
01:07:48,119 --> 01:07:52,680
damage at that point and so right before

1603
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:55,200
I took this footage I had found thrips

1604
01:07:52,679 --> 01:07:58,558
in the corner it's going to show it in a

1605
01:07:55,199 --> 01:08:00,038
sec in the one area where I didn't strip

1606
01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:01,960
the leaves like I totally forgot to

1607
01:08:00,039 --> 01:08:05,039
strip the leaves and it's like the one

1608
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:06,920
area where the lights not treating so it

1609
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:10,799
was pretty incredible this was on the

1610
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:12,480
ver at this point um like basically the

1611
01:08:10,798 --> 01:08:14,278
footage is just trying to show like you

1612
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:16,158
can't really hi you can't hide the

1613
01:08:14,278 --> 01:08:18,319
damage that thrips do it has like almost

1614
01:08:16,158 --> 01:08:21,679
like a slug paste that goes everywhere

1615
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:23,480
and this is where um this is right where

1616
01:08:21,679 --> 01:08:24,920
I found him and you can see I I moved

1617
01:08:23,479 --> 01:08:26,439
the light into the corner right before

1618
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:27,480
I'd taken the footage but you could see

1619
01:08:26,439 --> 01:08:31,318
they went

1620
01:08:27,479 --> 01:08:34,798
right into the corner and as the crop

1621
01:08:31,319 --> 01:08:37,039
went on I thought like I it you know I

1622
01:08:34,798 --> 01:08:39,439
considered it 97 to

1623
01:08:37,039 --> 01:08:41,719
98% um protection because we couldn't

1624
01:08:39,439 --> 01:08:44,000
kill them or beat them at at five

1625
01:08:41,719 --> 01:08:46,920
minutes a day but you couldn't see a

1626
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:50,798
trace of any damage in the top 30 plus

1627
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:54,119
inches which to me was beating them um

1628
01:08:50,798 --> 01:08:56,119
because you know you you I just we you

1629
01:08:54,119 --> 01:08:59,559
can't normally beat them and they will

1630
01:08:56,119 --> 01:09:03,119
just spread like um just insanely fast

1631
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:06,600
so anyways um we we started then wanting

1632
01:09:03,119 --> 01:09:10,278
to use UV to stress out the plant

1633
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:12,640
because UVA and UVB have been or UVA is

1634
01:09:10,279 --> 01:09:15,839
commonly used to like enhanced THC inter

1635
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:17,679
turpins and then you know UVB there's a

1636
01:09:15,838 --> 01:09:19,679
lot of evidence that it works a lot

1637
01:09:17,679 --> 01:09:22,199
better so then we started you know UVC

1638
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:25,480
has a much higher efficacy so we started

1639
01:09:22,198 --> 01:09:27,318
doing um two 15minute treatments and six

1640
01:09:25,479 --> 01:09:30,000
days later the thrips were completely

1641
01:09:27,319 --> 01:09:32,199
gone from the room completely just you

1642
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:34,798
could not find a thrip we uh we blew

1643
01:09:32,198 --> 01:09:37,079
Matthew Gates out from California he's

1644
01:09:34,798 --> 01:09:39,039
like a IPM specialist just to see if he

1645
01:09:37,079 --> 01:09:41,679
could find any and it was just kind of

1646
01:09:39,039 --> 01:09:44,920
mindblowing we accidentally dude I came

1647
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:47,319
out there with my macro [ __ ] lens and

1648
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:50,798
photographed that cop that crop looking

1649
01:09:47,319 --> 01:09:52,679
for thrips or any type of bug I have the

1650
01:09:50,798 --> 01:09:54,840
macro photographs there's not a bug

1651
01:09:52,679 --> 01:09:58,840
there's no bug [ __ ] there's no there's

1652
01:09:54,840 --> 01:10:00,159
no there's no sign of any bugs which

1653
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:03,079
which was the thing that caught my

1654
01:10:00,158 --> 01:10:05,079
attention that was my full circle yeah

1655
01:10:03,079 --> 01:10:07,158
it it was just kind of mindblowing to

1656
01:10:05,079 --> 01:10:09,039
kind of see that well we didn't even end

1657
01:10:07,158 --> 01:10:10,799
up beating them until like the sixth

1658
01:10:09,039 --> 01:10:14,399
week and when we were trying to enhance

1659
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:16,039
THC so at this point right now and this

1660
01:10:14,399 --> 01:10:17,879
is another shipping container I have

1661
01:10:16,039 --> 01:10:19,760
where I had three tents and there was

1662
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:21,199
another lab that participated with this

1663
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:24,440
and then someone else in Michigan and

1664
01:10:21,198 --> 01:10:26,479
someone else in Oregon where we're and

1665
01:10:24,439 --> 01:10:28,359
at this point when I was developing this

1666
01:10:26,479 --> 01:10:30,519
there was all different types of UVC

1667
01:10:28,359 --> 01:10:32,119
diodes they all have different types of

1668
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:34,159
efficacy they all have kind of different

1669
01:10:32,119 --> 01:10:35,920
types of wavelengths so we were trying

1670
01:10:34,158 --> 01:10:38,279
to determine what is going to be the

1671
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:39,840
most effective and so we were make and

1672
01:10:38,279 --> 01:10:41,960
we were also using different diode

1673
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:43,560
counts and we're um and we were running

1674
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:45,319
different mamps through the diodes just

1675
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:47,000
kind of developing it and at the same

1676
01:10:45,319 --> 01:10:50,759
time this is when we were testing

1677
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:53,560
spidermites and um and at the same time

1678
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:55,880
while we this is when we're we're we're

1679
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:57,840
taking like on our very first test we're

1680
01:10:55,880 --> 01:11:00,880
taking five to seven spider mites now

1681
01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:03,360
we're taking hundreds of spider mites

1682
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:06,679
and with lima bean leaves that have eggs

1683
01:11:03,359 --> 01:11:08,679
and letting them establish for hours

1684
01:11:06,679 --> 01:11:11,359
while these ones what you're looking at

1685
01:11:08,679 --> 01:11:15,039
right now this Leaf was clean 12 hours

1686
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:16,679
ago um so they've had 12 hours to like

1687
01:11:15,039 --> 01:11:18,600
what you can see the damage of what

1688
01:11:16,679 --> 01:11:21,399
they've done in 12 hours and it's pretty

1689
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:22,520
mind-blowing what they can do um it

1690
01:11:21,399 --> 01:11:25,639
hurts my

1691
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:28,480
soul yeah so then the every all the

1692
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:30,840
footage that you're seeing they had 36

1693
01:11:28,479 --> 01:11:32,759
hours to establish like well this is at

1694
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:34,279
TW the 12-h hour mark But W with this

1695
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:36,840
treatment before we actually started

1696
01:11:34,279 --> 01:11:38,599
using the light they had 36 hours to

1697
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:40,920
establish and we started doing 10-minute

1698
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:42,039
treatments and like we're about to do a

1699
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:44,079
whole bunch of more testing on

1700
01:11:42,039 --> 01:11:46,119
spidermites but it's still pretty

1701
01:11:44,079 --> 01:11:47,760
incredible so this is seven days later

1702
01:11:46,119 --> 01:11:50,279
so you can remember what they did to

1703
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:52,840
those leavs in the first 12 hours and we

1704
01:11:50,279 --> 01:11:55,880
can come to the very top leaf and it's

1705
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:58,600
totally clean and like the still alive

1706
01:11:55,880 --> 01:12:00,279
on the plant but the simple fact that

1707
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:01,719
after they're they've been like after

1708
01:12:00,279 --> 01:12:03,319
they get treated they get suppressed and

1709
01:12:01,719 --> 01:12:06,520
they just start walking around almost

1710
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:08,519
aimlessly you can see the adults are

1711
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:09,600
they're on the plant and they're but a

1712
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:11,400
lot of them are just kind of sitting

1713
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:13,400
there they're not doing setting up shop

1714
01:12:11,399 --> 01:12:17,519
what they normally do it screws with

1715
01:12:13,399 --> 01:12:18,839
their DNA and their RNA um like I said

1716
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:20,400
we have a un we're working with a

1717
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:21,840
university that is assisting with the

1718
01:12:20,399 --> 01:12:24,039
white paper so we don't have all the

1719
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:26,239
science on it yet but we do know that it

1720
01:12:24,039 --> 01:12:29,079
just a totally disrupts them without

1721
01:12:26,238 --> 01:12:30,559
question it's slowing um the spread down

1722
01:12:29,079 --> 01:12:34,679
by 90 to to

1723
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:38,120
95% but that's not to say that when we

1724
01:12:34,679 --> 01:12:40,359
incre with two 15 minute treatments that

1725
01:12:38,119 --> 01:12:41,479
we like we we have a chance to still

1726
01:12:40,359 --> 01:12:43,479
potentially beat them because we

1727
01:12:41,479 --> 01:12:45,000
couldn't like 10 minutes treatments

1728
01:12:43,479 --> 01:12:46,718
could not thrip like we couldn't beat

1729
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:49,279
thrips with two 10 minute or with a

1730
01:12:46,719 --> 01:12:51,079
10-minute treatment but two 15 minute uh

1731
01:12:49,279 --> 01:12:53,519
treatments we absolutely can beat them

1732
01:12:51,079 --> 01:12:56,158
where they are completely gone

1733
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:58,760
eradicated and right behind here you can

1734
01:12:56,158 --> 01:13:02,638
see these are kale plants that have

1735
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:06,239
hundreds of regular aphids and we

1736
01:13:02,639 --> 01:13:08,199
um it's within a couple days you can see

1737
01:13:06,238 --> 01:13:11,319
that there's like a trail of them

1738
01:13:08,198 --> 01:13:13,599
leaving and dying and it's extremely it

1739
01:13:11,319 --> 01:13:17,319
has a high very high efficacy on aphids

1740
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:19,920
within 14 days over 90% of them are dead

1741
01:13:17,319 --> 01:13:22,439
on the plant just right in their tracks

1742
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:25,158
breaking down so I will say the first

1743
01:13:22,439 --> 01:13:29,119
prop that he showed which was that death

1744
01:13:25,158 --> 01:13:30,399
buba with the um thrips I went there I

1745
01:13:29,119 --> 01:13:34,238
photographed

1746
01:13:30,399 --> 01:13:36,839
it then we harvested it he harvested it

1747
01:13:34,238 --> 01:13:39,319
and we ran it through bubble bags in my

1748
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:43,119
living room because I just wanted to see

1749
01:13:39,319 --> 01:13:44,799
I to me it it didn't seem possible that

1750
01:13:43,119 --> 01:13:46,880
a plant could get that bad of an

1751
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:49,560
infestation and not be drastically

1752
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:53,039
affected in its yield and or quality and

1753
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:57,000
caliber of resin and it came out like

1754
01:13:53,039 --> 01:14:00,399
festar resin and we I think we got about

1755
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:03,079
22 or 23% so the yield was there the

1756
01:14:00,399 --> 01:14:04,920
quality was there it kind of blew my

1757
01:14:03,079 --> 01:14:07,000
mind I'm not going to lie and that's

1758
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:08,760
that was really sort of the the the

1759
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:10,719
nudge I needed to be like you know what

1760
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:13,320
this seemed I just remember being a

1761
01:14:10,719 --> 01:14:15,560
young grower and how de I mean listen

1762
01:14:13,319 --> 01:14:17,719
from the perspective of like even food

1763
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:19,239
production peppers and all these other

1764
01:14:17,719 --> 01:14:22,239
different things like this

1765
01:14:19,238 --> 01:14:24,439
is pretty insane when you think about it

1766
01:14:22,238 --> 01:14:27,158
now obviously I have always concerns

1767
01:14:24,439 --> 01:14:28,439
about just disruption of DNA and RNA and

1768
01:14:27,158 --> 01:14:30,359
I wouldn't want to be in the room while

1769
01:14:28,439 --> 01:14:33,960
this thing is on Thomas suggests that

1770
01:14:30,359 --> 01:14:37,319
you're not in the room while it's on um

1771
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:39,679
because it is UVC yeah ABS well

1772
01:14:37,319 --> 01:14:41,519
absolutely like uh this can cause cancer

1773
01:14:39,679 --> 01:14:43,679
it's just a fact so you absolutely don't

1774
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:45,159
want to be anywhere near this and you

1775
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:46,960
want to use it in the middle of the

1776
01:14:45,158 --> 01:14:49,559
darkness and that's where well we came

1777
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:51,198
across an article that kind of led to

1778
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:53,600
everything and how everything developed

1779
01:14:51,198 --> 01:14:55,479
but um bugs are attracted to light in

1780
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:57,880
the middle of darkness and even though

1781
01:14:55,479 --> 01:14:59,638
UV 5 Watts might to our human eye

1782
01:14:57,880 --> 01:15:01,719
doesn't look like very much and it's not

1783
01:14:59,639 --> 01:15:04,079
enough to disrupt the plant sleeping but

1784
01:15:01,719 --> 01:15:07,079
it's a lot to an insect and it's enough

1785
01:15:04,079 --> 01:15:09,920
for them to be kind of like attracted in

1786
01:15:07,079 --> 01:15:12,119
and um what what's really exciting here

1787
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:15,520
is what we haven't discussed yet is we

1788
01:15:12,119 --> 01:15:18,039
had a timer failure um that led to

1789
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:19,719
another really incredible Discovery Well

1790
01:15:18,039 --> 01:15:21,399
we have like I already brought up that

1791
01:15:19,719 --> 01:15:22,279
people it's commonly known that people

1792
01:15:21,399 --> 01:15:26,198
use

1793
01:15:22,279 --> 01:15:29,279
UVA um to enhance THC Turpin which UVA

1794
01:15:26,198 --> 01:15:32,799
is basically like a blue it's 315

1795
01:15:29,279 --> 01:15:35,559
nanometer to 400 nanometer wavelength

1796
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:37,560
and um you know going back almost seven

1797
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:40,000
years ago I saw a whole bunch of people

1798
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:44,600
that participated when they're go going

1799
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:47,800
and using UVA against UVB UVB is 280 to

1800
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:50,960
3155 and we saw like a like the UVA

1801
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:52,960
there was almost no gain um but the UVB

1802
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:56,920
there was a huge gain so we knew with

1803
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:58,920
UVC with like 100 to 280 nmet that there

1804
01:15:56,920 --> 01:16:00,719
is um well it's going to have the

1805
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:04,359
highest efficacy for hurting or doing

1806
01:16:00,719 --> 01:16:07,359
damage so anyways we had a timer fail

1807
01:16:04,359 --> 01:16:09,079
and came in the room and the plants

1808
01:16:07,359 --> 01:16:11,639
every part of the plant was completely

1809
01:16:09,079 --> 01:16:13,439
[ __ ] like so that's when we learned

1810
01:16:11,639 --> 01:16:16,199
that the light can be systemically

1811
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:17,759
admitted into the plant um so that is

1812
01:16:16,198 --> 01:16:19,879
something that we're going to be playing

1813
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:21,800
with um it was also really good that

1814
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:23,480
this actually happened because we

1815
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:25,119
realized like hey oh my goodness if

1816
01:16:23,479 --> 01:16:27,119
someone has a timer failure they could

1817
01:16:25,119 --> 01:16:30,000
kill their crop with these lights so we

1818
01:16:27,119 --> 01:16:31,679
were able to develop our driver um the

1819
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:33,840
MCU and the driver so it can only run

1820
01:16:31,679 --> 01:16:36,960
for 15 minutes at a

1821
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:40,360
time anyways I don't really have too

1822
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:42,480
much more than that on it um well simple

1823
01:16:40,359 --> 01:16:45,719
fact that we're developing it we have a

1824
01:16:42,479 --> 01:16:47,839
Utility Patent too on how it mounts and

1825
01:16:45,719 --> 01:16:50,000
um like I I believe in two years from

1826
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:52,960
now anybody that's doing commercial

1827
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:55,238
growing will be using it or like a

1828
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:58,480
knockoff of it because it it break the

1829
01:16:55,238 --> 01:17:01,799
rules of growing um we it's also the

1830
01:16:58,479 --> 01:17:04,359
very first EPA certified pesticide light

1831
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:04,360
in the United

1832
01:17:04,760 --> 01:17:10,239
States Thomas can I ask you can I ask

1833
01:17:07,399 --> 01:17:12,279
you a question about how um is it is it

1834
01:17:10,238 --> 01:17:13,799
drawing because you said it the small

1835
01:17:12,279 --> 01:17:16,679
amount of Lights attract insects so is

1836
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:21,199
it drawing the plants to the UV and then

1837
01:17:16,679 --> 01:17:22,920
the UV is having the effect well I I it

1838
01:17:21,198 --> 01:17:25,039
definitely draws it to them and then

1839
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:26,440
it's screwing them up but like we were

1840
01:17:25,039 --> 01:17:28,840
confused by the science when we

1841
01:17:26,439 --> 01:17:31,319
absolutely like eradicated them like the

1842
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:33,000
first time like when I thought that we

1843
01:17:31,319 --> 01:17:35,559
it was you know stopping them from being

1844
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:37,840
able to reproduce initially so I was

1845
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:39,920
thinking okay it's taken us five or six

1846
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:43,279
weeks to get to this point and now all

1847
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:44,719
of a sudden they're gone but then uh and

1848
01:17:43,279 --> 01:17:47,158
here's another thing in the very first

1849
01:17:44,719 --> 01:17:48,920
test we were also moving the lights up

1850
01:17:47,158 --> 01:17:51,000
to get it as close as possible to

1851
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:52,760
anywhere where it was infected where on

1852
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:54,880
the following crop we realized we didn't

1853
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:57,400
have to even move the lights up we just

1854
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:59,920
ran it for those two 15minute cycles and

1855
01:17:57,399 --> 01:18:02,079
it's like they were gone so like they I

1856
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:05,199
I definitely think that they are um

1857
01:18:02,079 --> 01:18:06,800
attracted to it I can't say I can't say

1858
01:18:05,198 --> 01:18:09,719
just all the science behind it but all I

1859
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:12,279
can say is that 100% eradicates thrips

1860
01:18:09,719 --> 01:18:14,600
and like I actually believe that spider

1861
01:18:12,279 --> 01:18:16,840
mites it's possible well we we already

1862
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:18,840
have like 90 to 95% protection with

1863
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:21,000
spider mites but I think if like 250

1864
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:24,840
minute treatments could have a similar

1865
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:27,039
effect on um like as it is to thrips and

1866
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:29,760
know thrips and spider mites are what I

1867
01:18:27,039 --> 01:18:31,600
would consider the two biggest pests in

1868
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:33,960
cannabis obviously there's a lot of you

1869
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:36,199
know fungus snats and aphids and

1870
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:38,560
obviously rude aphids are another kind

1871
01:18:36,198 --> 01:18:40,039
of level and um broad mites and rusted

1872
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:42,039
mites but I actually believe it would be

1873
01:18:40,039 --> 01:18:43,920
very effective against broad mites and

1874
01:18:42,039 --> 01:18:46,079
rusted mites the problem with rud aphids

1875
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:48,880
is they can stay their whole life in the

1876
01:18:46,079 --> 01:18:51,198
soil even if they're a full

1877
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:53,000
adult I like the idea that as a

1878
01:18:51,198 --> 01:18:54,799
preventative you know like for sure

1879
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:56,158
there's going to be people in initially

1880
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:57,480
that are like I got an infestation I'm

1881
01:18:56,158 --> 01:19:00,638
going to go out and get these lights and

1882
01:18:57,479 --> 01:19:02,399
blast it hard you know I like it more as

1883
01:19:00,639 --> 01:19:04,560
a just have them in your room they're

1884
01:19:02,399 --> 01:19:06,238
five minutes twice a day they're just

1885
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:07,760
preventative like you said Thomas it's

1886
01:19:06,238 --> 01:19:09,559
not like you're going to get 20,000

1887
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:14,400
spidermites at once it's going to be

1888
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:15,960
like a few and if you exactly yeah it

1889
01:19:14,399 --> 01:19:18,399
also someone I saw someone in the

1890
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:20,960
comments asked about mold and it will

1891
01:19:18,399 --> 01:19:22,719
fact kill mildew so like you could put

1892
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:24,800
it right in front of mildew and it will

1893
01:19:22,719 --> 01:19:27,399
kill it but it's not going to kill or

1894
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:30,079
solve a mildew problem like a mildew

1895
01:19:27,399 --> 01:19:32,519
problem is like if you're um for example

1896
01:19:30,079 --> 01:19:35,279
if your VPD is totally way off the

1897
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:38,320
biggest reason why people get mildew in

1898
01:19:35,279 --> 01:19:40,198
my opinion is in the nighttime the cycle

1899
01:19:38,319 --> 01:19:42,519
it gets too cold with your humidity that

1900
01:19:40,198 --> 01:19:46,238
gets too high and you get a doe point

1901
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:47,920
and that's like how um it's it can't

1902
01:19:46,238 --> 01:19:50,119
can't fix or it's not going to solve

1903
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:51,760
something like that but like I said it

1904
01:19:50,119 --> 01:19:55,119
definitely is going to fight and help

1905
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:57,719
microbials um too it's kind like the

1906
01:19:55,119 --> 01:20:01,238
ultimate well like it works to enhance

1907
01:19:57,719 --> 01:20:02,600
THC and turpins it fights mold and it

1908
01:20:01,238 --> 01:20:05,718
fights um

1909
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:08,960
bugs and for such a low wattage and um

1910
01:20:05,719 --> 01:20:10,920
like let's be realistic even using 10

1911
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:12,399
watts for 30 minutes a day is not going

1912
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:15,279
to make it it's not going to change

1913
01:20:12,399 --> 01:20:15,279
anybody's Bill

1914
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:18,840
basically per

1915
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:24,119
light yeah they're tiny tiny little

1916
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:26,480
little Dodgers I'm always interested in

1917
01:20:24,119 --> 01:20:29,639
um

1918
01:20:26,479 --> 01:20:32,799
I mean obviously my all-time favorite is

1919
01:20:29,639 --> 01:20:34,679
outdoor regenerative organic like that's

1920
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:37,000
that's that's my favorite but I do love

1921
01:20:34,679 --> 01:20:39,239
the fact that like I've even grown some

1922
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:42,079
incredible cannabis like just

1923
01:20:39,238 --> 01:20:44,000
indoors just with food that I bought at

1924
01:20:42,079 --> 01:20:45,600
the store I mean it was an organic I

1925
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:48,119
think I used like what was that [ __ ]

1926
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:51,199
called Earth Juice I think was something

1927
01:20:48,119 --> 01:20:53,639
I used like 25 years ago or something

1928
01:20:51,198 --> 01:20:56,198
just smelt like fish emulsions and other

1929
01:20:53,639 --> 01:20:57,760
like death Tea open that [ __ ] up and

1930
01:20:56,198 --> 01:20:59,919
someone was like oh my god did someone

1931
01:20:57,760 --> 01:21:02,320
die in here it's like no man it's my

1932
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:04,319
Earth Juice got to put a little bit on

1933
01:21:02,319 --> 01:21:07,399
oh I [ __ ] have got some on my hand oh my

1934
01:21:04,319 --> 01:21:07,399
God that's gonna smell for a

1935
01:21:08,719 --> 01:21:14,119
while the

1936
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:16,360
concentrate like really strong yeah it

1937
01:21:14,119 --> 01:21:19,279
was super concentrated we come out

1938
01:21:16,359 --> 01:21:20,960
like like a little did not pour very

1939
01:21:19,279 --> 01:21:23,519
well that Earth Juice especially if it

1940
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:25,600
aged for any amount of time but uh what

1941
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:27,360
I was meaning was I still appreciate

1942
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:29,120
cannabis expressed in all these

1943
01:21:27,359 --> 01:21:31,119
different ways obviously I'm not a big

1944
01:21:29,119 --> 01:21:33,399
fan of cannabis that's been sprayed by

1945
01:21:31,119 --> 01:21:36,439
deadly chemicals because I am going to

1946
01:21:33,399 --> 01:21:39,198
uh vaporize uh the materials and inhale

1947
01:21:36,439 --> 01:21:41,919
them into my lung so you know organic is

1948
01:21:39,198 --> 01:21:45,399
is definitely it's crazy that we have to

1949
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:48,199
use a word for just normal this is just

1950
01:21:45,399 --> 01:21:49,839
normal like no no it's organic organic

1951
01:21:48,198 --> 01:21:51,399
that sounds expensive it's like no it

1952
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:54,239
can't be like it has to be more

1953
01:21:51,399 --> 01:21:56,559
expensive to buy chemicals and spray

1954
01:21:54,238 --> 01:21:59,599
them all over your plant then to not put

1955
01:21:56,560 --> 01:22:01,039
chemicals on your plant it has to be I

1956
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:03,000
don't know what kind of [ __ ] crazy

1957
01:22:01,039 --> 01:22:04,760
world we're living in the Bizarro world

1958
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:07,359
that Mojave was talking about earlier

1959
01:22:04,760 --> 01:22:11,840
where they just subsidize things so that

1960
01:22:07,359 --> 01:22:14,759
it makes no sense in the economy because

1961
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:16,880
clearly what's that do you see bit pin

1962
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:21,280
Scandal here in California over the last

1963
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:24,079
couple months with the remind me oh man

1964
01:22:21,279 --> 01:22:26,359
well the LA Times went and pulled

1965
01:22:24,079 --> 01:22:29,719
products Off the Shelf at a at a few

1966
01:22:26,359 --> 01:22:32,039
dispensaries and had them tested by a

1967
01:22:29,719 --> 01:22:35,679
far more comprehensive lab than the

1968
01:22:32,039 --> 01:22:38,000
state mandated labs and found they were

1969
01:22:35,679 --> 01:22:39,600
filled man they were filled with things

1970
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:41,439
that are banned in the US not just

1971
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:44,360
banned for cannabis but banned in the

1972
01:22:41,439 --> 01:22:47,638
entire us they were they had some stuff

1973
01:22:44,359 --> 01:22:50,279
that was in the single use potential

1974
01:22:47,639 --> 01:22:53,079
harm realm you know just for irritance

1975
01:22:50,279 --> 01:22:55,519
and all that stuff and and pack

1976
01:22:53,079 --> 01:22:57,880
lutrol which is has nothing to do with

1977
01:22:55,520 --> 01:23:01,440
fighting off any it's not going to kill

1978
01:22:57,880 --> 01:23:04,319
your crop it's just about rock hard nugs

1979
01:23:01,439 --> 01:23:05,879
so so it was still everywhere and

1980
01:23:04,319 --> 01:23:07,399
basically what it comes down to is and

1981
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:10,679
the whole California supply chain is

1982
01:23:07,399 --> 01:23:12,479
[ __ ] and there's like elicit [ __ ] that

1983
01:23:10,679 --> 01:23:14,600
makes it in and it gets all flopped

1984
01:23:12,479 --> 01:23:16,799
around but the crazy part is now they're

1985
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:20,039
realizing that out of the three big

1986
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:22,520
distillate manufacturers in the state

1987
01:23:20,039 --> 01:23:25,479
you could have as many as 80 Farms

1988
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:27,480
contributing to one Vape pan

1989
01:23:25,479 --> 01:23:29,759
because they're literally dumping it all

1990
01:23:27,479 --> 01:23:33,599
in the big

1991
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:36,119
VAP and so if one out of the 80 Farms is

1992
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:37,800
a a dirty player which there were and

1993
01:23:36,119 --> 01:23:40,238
there probably were more than one out of

1994
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:42,360
the 80 but just the idea that we've

1995
01:23:40,238 --> 01:23:47,359
gotten to this point where it's this big

1996
01:23:42,359 --> 01:23:49,719
giant you know uh corn syrup world that

1997
01:23:47,359 --> 01:23:51,439
we live in you know high fructose corn

1998
01:23:49,719 --> 01:23:54,639
syrup that came from how many different

1999
01:23:51,439 --> 01:23:58,238
corn fields and the fact that there's

2000
01:23:54,639 --> 01:24:00,000
still the greed element is a big part of

2001
01:23:58,238 --> 01:24:01,439
it and failing farms and all the

2002
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:05,000
problems and everyone's like oh I got to

2003
01:24:01,439 --> 01:24:06,719
make money but the reality is you know

2004
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:09,960
and the sad part was you know the the

2005
01:24:06,719 --> 01:24:12,439
DCC had just done a $5 million campaign

2006
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:16,158
to show DC is the Department of cannabis

2007
01:24:12,439 --> 01:24:18,479
control use tax money collected from C

2008
01:24:16,158 --> 01:24:20,079
cannabis Revenue to do a $5 million

2009
01:24:18,479 --> 01:24:22,638
campaign to show people that buying

2010
01:24:20,079 --> 01:24:25,158
cannabis was safe you could walk into a

2011
01:24:22,639 --> 01:24:29,319
dispensary and just like we test it and

2012
01:24:25,158 --> 01:24:32,359
all this stuff and then they test it and

2013
01:24:29,319 --> 01:24:35,279
you know it it exposed the dirty supply

2014
01:24:32,359 --> 01:24:37,039
chain it also diso exposed that the labs

2015
01:24:35,279 --> 01:24:40,479
aren't necessarily testing as much as

2016
01:24:37,039 --> 01:24:43,319
they should it exposed that some Labs

2017
01:24:40,479 --> 01:24:44,759
don't do some Labs give you a pass you

2018
01:24:43,319 --> 01:24:47,118
know some Labs will say like you know

2019
01:24:44,760 --> 01:24:49,079
hey we'll give you a pass you know shop

2020
01:24:47,118 --> 01:24:51,960
with us and we give you the highest THC

2021
01:24:49,079 --> 01:24:54,439
numbers and we also pass your you know

2022
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:56,760
so the whole the whole industry is all

2023
01:24:54,439 --> 01:24:59,279
[ __ ] and and it's kind of the fast

2024
01:24:56,760 --> 01:25:02,360
food side of it it's not the Su grown

2025
01:24:59,279 --> 01:25:05,599
you know Family Farm Boutique organic

2026
01:25:02,359 --> 01:25:09,519
thing it's the big commercial failed

2027
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:12,920
Farm trim Market you know where people

2028
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:15,520
are selling five or $10 pounds of of trm

2029
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:18,480
or moldy weed or whatever and turning it

2030
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:22,040
into distillate and isolate and now you

2031
01:25:18,479 --> 01:25:25,198
know we've got a a huge vape and gummy

2032
01:25:22,039 --> 01:25:28,118
and you know edible market and it's just

2033
01:25:25,198 --> 01:25:29,279
uh it's been exposed so now shops are

2034
01:25:28,118 --> 01:25:30,920
like going through like you know a lot

2035
01:25:29,279 --> 01:25:33,279
of a lot of customers are showing up

2036
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:35,480
saying hey is this safe so some shops

2037
01:25:33,279 --> 01:25:39,920
have taken it on to actually test their

2038
01:25:35,479 --> 01:25:42,759
own products with the expanded panel um

2039
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:45,118
that the state doesn't mandate because

2040
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:47,560
we now know that there's things in there

2041
01:25:45,118 --> 01:25:49,519
that they're not even testing for and

2042
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:53,159
it's just far that's exactly

2043
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:55,520
it yeah so anyway so all these years

2044
01:25:53,158 --> 01:25:57,759
later you know working in cannabis it's

2045
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:59,760
still a mess and there's still a lot of

2046
01:25:57,760 --> 01:26:03,000
people you know that came into this

2047
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:05,400
industry to make money and and the state

2048
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:08,079
hasn't managed the transition well but

2049
01:26:05,399 --> 01:26:10,799
this Vape pin thing was really a big

2050
01:26:08,079 --> 01:26:13,479
story you can look it up it's a LA Times

2051
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:14,960
piece and it it's got a lot of traction

2052
01:26:13,479 --> 01:26:16,279
this is why I need hash Church in my

2053
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:18,279
life because I would not have been

2054
01:26:16,279 --> 01:26:20,599
exposed to this otherwise and I'm always

2055
01:26:18,279 --> 01:26:23,079
happy to hear about things like this and

2056
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:25,280
make sure that uh you know we're going

2057
01:26:23,079 --> 01:26:27,118
deeper with our own

2058
01:26:25,279 --> 01:26:28,439
hardware for the brand like make sure

2059
01:26:27,118 --> 01:26:31,118
that you're picking and choosing the

2060
01:26:28,439 --> 01:26:33,039
right things obviously we're already on

2061
01:26:31,118 --> 01:26:34,960
the conscious side of things in the

2062
01:26:33,039 --> 01:26:36,880
sense that we're not using moldy

2063
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:39,000
material we're not using chemically

2064
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:42,000
sprayed material and we're not making

2065
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:45,719
distillate we're making live hash rosin

2066
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:47,719
which is um yeah it's so crazy how greed

2067
01:26:45,719 --> 01:26:49,880
is such a crazy factor that it turns

2068
01:26:47,719 --> 01:26:52,520
into these monster scandals it's like

2069
01:26:49,880 --> 01:26:54,279
people don't start out evil they just

2070
01:26:52,520 --> 01:26:56,400
they just kind of like one step at a

2071
01:26:54,279 --> 01:26:57,960
time as they get into a deeper hole and

2072
01:26:56,399 --> 01:27:00,679
they need to be pulled out it's like

2073
01:26:57,960 --> 01:27:02,880
well I can just sell all this moldy herb

2074
01:27:00,679 --> 01:27:05,880
to the lab and we could turn it into

2075
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:10,880
distillate then we could put it in

2076
01:27:05,880 --> 01:27:13,239
with uh uh tpin uh Botanical Turpin that

2077
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:16,560
also have contaminations you know I

2078
01:27:13,238 --> 01:27:19,519
think when when Horatio bought his um D

2079
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:23,880
lemoning the contaminant was called

2080
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:28,320
Citrus oil and it made up 5% of what was

2081
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:31,279
in in that five gallon drum it was like

2082
01:27:28,319 --> 01:27:33,039
a full leader of just like

2083
01:27:31,279 --> 01:27:35,279
orange

2084
01:27:33,039 --> 01:27:37,158
strange [ __ ] that he pulled out of a

2085
01:27:35,279 --> 01:27:41,000
clear liquid which I think you might

2086
01:27:37,158 --> 01:27:45,920
have helped him with Dr Mark if I do so

2087
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:50,359
remember yeah I did oh my God man it's

2088
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:55,158
it's a it's a [ __ ] show what what what

2089
01:27:50,359 --> 01:27:58,359
um you know um I it's hard to even know

2090
01:27:55,158 --> 01:28:01,039
where to begin I think you have to begin

2091
01:27:58,359 --> 01:28:05,000
at least and you know we haven't been on

2092
01:28:01,039 --> 01:28:08,359
hash church too much since um um the

2093
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:12,238
Farmville right so

2094
01:28:08,359 --> 01:28:14,880
um it it it's just it was never intended

2095
01:28:12,238 --> 01:28:19,039
I think when they signed a farm bill I

2096
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:22,239
think they got snookered on seeds oil

2097
01:28:19,039 --> 01:28:25,000
and rope right I mean I I don't I don't

2098
01:28:22,238 --> 01:28:29,039
even think they contemplated C CBD

2099
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:31,880
because CBD at the time had just gotten

2100
01:28:29,039 --> 01:28:36,960
its approval as the active ingredient

2101
01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:41,239
for epid dialects so um there was no and

2102
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:44,439
yeah you the the um the food drug and

2103
01:28:41,238 --> 01:28:47,879
cosmetic act prohibits the use of FDA

2104
01:28:44,439 --> 01:28:50,719
approved active in ingredient in food

2105
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:55,079
feeder Cosmetics so basically that means

2106
01:28:50,719 --> 01:28:58,158
the whole CBD industry as it exists

2107
01:28:55,079 --> 01:29:01,639
was never contemplated because they're

2108
01:28:58,158 --> 01:29:03,319
basically in violation of federal law it

2109
01:29:01,639 --> 01:29:05,679
it's interesting because if you read

2110
01:29:03,319 --> 01:29:08,559
that law it basically says for

2111
01:29:05,679 --> 01:29:10,880
interstate commerce so I guess guess as

2112
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:15,280
long as you keep within a state I guess

2113
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:19,520
it's okay but um that's where it it kind

2114
01:29:15,279 --> 01:29:23,800
of started Marcus really I mean I think

2115
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:27,159
yeah I mean this this vape pen thing is

2116
01:29:23,800 --> 01:29:31,520
the fact that um you

2117
01:29:27,158 --> 01:29:37,759
can chemically convert CBD into

2118
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:39,920
THC at about one1 the cost of yeah and

2119
01:29:37,760 --> 01:29:41,719
you Mojave will tell you too it depends

2120
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:44,880
on you know what your economics and your

2121
01:29:41,719 --> 01:29:50,118
supply chain are but when CBD has

2122
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:52,960
cratered to $250 a kilogram it only adds

2123
01:29:50,118 --> 01:29:56,679
a little bit of cost to now convert that

2124
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:58,480
into Delta nine so the people who were

2125
01:29:56,679 --> 01:30:01,239
originally converting it were converting

2126
01:29:58,479 --> 01:30:04,919
it into Delta 8 and that's you see all

2127
01:30:01,238 --> 01:30:08,319
these delta8 products really proliferate

2128
01:30:04,920 --> 01:30:11,920
for the most part in states where there

2129
01:30:08,319 --> 01:30:14,519
isn't you know good cannabis products

2130
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:18,399
now California again is a notable

2131
01:30:14,520 --> 01:30:21,119
exception and so there's a a lawsuit

2132
01:30:18,399 --> 01:30:25,638
between several dispensaries in the Los

2133
01:30:21,118 --> 01:30:28,118
Angeles area and these hemp

2134
01:30:25,639 --> 01:30:32,880
manufacturers who are basically making

2135
01:30:28,118 --> 01:30:34,679
$8 disposable vape pens that you know I

2136
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:37,079
I I don't know it really depends on like

2137
01:30:34,679 --> 01:30:39,719
what your cost of production are but

2138
01:30:37,079 --> 01:30:42,118
whatever the cost of production is the

2139
01:30:39,719 --> 01:30:44,520
hemp guys are a whole lot cheaper

2140
01:30:42,118 --> 01:30:47,000
because they don't have the regulation

2141
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:49,320
and they have a much larger addressable

2142
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:51,960
Market as soon as they could sell on the

2143
01:30:49,319 --> 01:30:54,479
internet two clicks after saying you're

2144
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:57,679
21 years old they're asking for your

2145
01:30:54,479 --> 01:31:00,279
credit card information so I mean how do

2146
01:30:57,679 --> 01:31:02,440
you compete and how do you expect a

2147
01:31:00,279 --> 01:31:04,639
population of people to go to the

2148
01:31:02,439 --> 01:31:06,719
dispensary and buy stuff at the

2149
01:31:04,639 --> 01:31:10,279
dispensary when they could get stuff

2150
01:31:06,719 --> 01:31:13,000
online or at a gas station a whole lot

2151
01:31:10,279 --> 01:31:16,719
cheaper yeah a lot of these places you

2152
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:18,800
could still go to jail for smoking weed

2153
01:31:16,719 --> 01:31:21,639
but on the way to jail you could stop at

2154
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:25,039
the gas station and get yourself a Delta

2155
01:31:21,639 --> 01:31:26,359
eight pen or you know some gummies and

2156
01:31:25,039 --> 01:31:28,760
now that they're in gummies and

2157
01:31:26,359 --> 01:31:32,399
beverages Mark you know like beverages

2158
01:31:28,760 --> 01:31:35,360
is huge what what um what Minnesota did

2159
01:31:32,399 --> 01:31:37,319
so there's just the patchwork of

2160
01:31:35,359 --> 01:31:40,719
Regulation down here in the States and

2161
01:31:37,319 --> 01:31:44,559
what Minnesota did is the the the liquor

2162
01:31:40,719 --> 01:31:47,079
people who sell alcohol in Minnesota saw

2163
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:50,400
this THC beverage thing coming and all

2164
01:31:47,079 --> 01:31:53,920
of a sudden they're like okay um uh uh

2165
01:31:50,399 --> 01:31:58,719
liquor stores in Minnesota could sell uh

2166
01:31:53,920 --> 01:32:02,000
10 mgram CBD you know cans of Seltzer

2167
01:31:58,719 --> 01:32:04,198
and fruity soda and [ __ ] like that and

2168
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:07,719
that just opened up this huge Market

2169
01:32:04,198 --> 01:32:10,158
because basically you know let's face it

2170
01:32:07,719 --> 01:32:12,960
we are a

2171
01:32:10,158 --> 01:32:15,799
commodity um in a

2172
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:19,039
commodity uh it's the race to the bottom

2173
01:32:15,800 --> 01:32:22,840
so you need to reduce your production

2174
01:32:19,039 --> 01:32:25,519
cost at all wherever you can and in

2175
01:32:22,840 --> 01:32:29,360
reduction of production cost yeah at the

2176
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:31,400
end of the day why am I going to spend

2177
01:32:29,359 --> 01:32:34,639
10 times the amount of money to make

2178
01:32:31,399 --> 01:32:37,638
that 10 milligrams of THC when I could

2179
01:32:34,639 --> 01:32:40,440
chemically convert that from cheap ass

2180
01:32:37,639 --> 01:32:42,960
CBD so in my building I'm bringing in

2181
01:32:40,439 --> 01:32:44,879
CBD right which has been made legal

2182
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:46,840
because of the farm bill and now I'm

2183
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:50,639
chemically converting that what people

2184
01:32:46,840 --> 01:32:52,679
really want not CBD THC right and the

2185
01:32:50,639 --> 01:32:55,679
converters have gotten sophisticated

2186
01:32:52,679 --> 01:32:57,319
enough so they're chemistry at first was

2187
01:32:55,679 --> 01:32:58,760
their chemistry gain wasn't as good as

2188
01:32:57,319 --> 01:33:01,840
it should be and they were basically

2189
01:32:58,760 --> 01:33:05,400
dumping everything into Delta 8 which is

2190
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:08,480
basically the thermodynamic product uh

2191
01:33:05,399 --> 01:33:12,000
so Delta 8 is not made by the plant

2192
01:33:08,479 --> 01:33:14,638
Delta 8 is a de is a regul is a um is a

2193
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:19,279
degradation product right plant only

2194
01:33:14,639 --> 01:33:21,359
makes Delta n configured canono but the

2195
01:33:19,279 --> 01:33:24,118
Delta 8 that's there is usually just in

2196
01:33:21,359 --> 01:33:26,759
Trace Amounts and usually I think it's

2197
01:33:24,118 --> 01:33:30,000
just a artifact of the measurement

2198
01:33:26,760 --> 01:33:32,360
itself so in that sampling of the

2199
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:34,158
process you're actually converting some

2200
01:33:32,359 --> 01:33:36,519
the Delta 8 there's no delta8 in the

2201
01:33:34,158 --> 01:33:39,599
plant there's no Delta 8 made in that

2202
01:33:36,520 --> 01:33:43,040
biochemical pathway only Delta 9 but

2203
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:45,960
like Delta 8 is not mentioned in the

2204
01:33:43,039 --> 01:33:48,760
farm bill so it created this loophole

2205
01:33:45,960 --> 01:33:52,600
for people to say okay as long as I

2206
01:33:48,760 --> 01:33:54,760
convert my CBD into Delta 8 people get

2207
01:33:52,600 --> 01:33:57,280
high they don't give a [ __ ] they can

2208
01:33:54,760 --> 01:33:59,600
just put some SpongeBob kind of cartoon

2209
01:33:57,279 --> 01:34:03,439
character on some label and next thing

2210
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:05,960
you know gummies vape pens soda pop all

2211
01:34:03,439 --> 01:34:08,198
that [ __ ] will be sold and not out of a

2212
01:34:05,960 --> 01:34:11,520
dispensary and not the kind of products

2213
01:34:08,198 --> 01:34:15,118
that you guys like like Marcus and you

2214
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:18,560
know quality Growers and quality single

2215
01:34:15,118 --> 01:34:21,880
Source hash this is just THC the

2216
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:25,039
molecule in some fruity drink or some

2217
01:34:21,880 --> 01:34:27,520
fruity candy that kids can eat and sneak

2218
01:34:25,039 --> 01:34:30,679
while they're in high school and yeah I

2219
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:33,400
think it's a real big problem and it's

2220
01:34:30,679 --> 01:34:36,199
probably only possible because of

2221
01:34:33,399 --> 01:34:39,279
prohibition itself that this problem

2222
01:34:36,198 --> 01:34:41,839
actually exists it wouldn't exist if if

2223
01:34:39,279 --> 01:34:45,840
people had access to good quality weed

2224
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:49,400
they wouldn't need delta8 and hhcp and

2225
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:52,199
thcp and and and and acetate there's

2226
01:34:49,399 --> 01:34:54,920
been a lot of people going to the

2227
01:34:52,198 --> 01:34:57,638
hospital because the T C acetate that's

2228
01:34:54,920 --> 01:34:59,560
not very clean and I guess what they now

2229
01:34:57,639 --> 01:35:01,800
found is that when you heat up THC

2230
01:34:59,560 --> 01:35:03,360
acetate it converts into something

2231
01:35:01,800 --> 01:35:05,480
called ketene which is something you

2232
01:35:03,359 --> 01:35:08,719
don't want to be breathing into your

2233
01:35:05,479 --> 01:35:12,039
lungs but yeah all artificially made

2234
01:35:08,719 --> 01:35:14,319
because of prohibition I'll stop

2235
01:35:12,039 --> 01:35:16,238
there you know it's crazy I have some

2236
01:35:14,319 --> 01:35:18,319
friends out in North Carolina and they

2237
01:35:16,238 --> 01:35:20,599
they're super conscious like they grow

2238
01:35:18,319 --> 01:35:22,799
organically they process everything

2239
01:35:20,600 --> 01:35:24,920
themselves they do live has rosin but

2240
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:27,199
they're in that World they don't do the

2241
01:35:24,920 --> 01:35:29,600
deltan 8 they're just literally making

2242
01:35:27,198 --> 01:35:33,879
the you know they're using that

2243
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:36,440
that weakness in the farm bill and

2244
01:35:33,880 --> 01:35:39,679
exploiting it to get

2245
01:35:36,439 --> 01:35:41,399
like yeah well exactly with live has

2246
01:35:39,679 --> 01:35:42,239
roosen though so they do it in a way

2247
01:35:41,399 --> 01:35:46,960
that's

2248
01:35:42,238 --> 01:35:51,118
like I can't exact well it it's

2249
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:53,279
THC a well that's the other thing is

2250
01:35:51,118 --> 01:35:57,639
that is that it when they read the farm

2251
01:35:53,279 --> 01:36:00,359
bill only references to thca or THC but

2252
01:35:57,639 --> 01:36:03,118
we all know that thca is the precursor

2253
01:36:00,359 --> 01:36:05,519
to THC in the plant so these people are

2254
01:36:03,118 --> 01:36:09,479
all hiding behind this

2255
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:12,000
so-called loophole sing that somehow but

2256
01:36:09,479 --> 01:36:15,039
if you read the code of federal

2257
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:17,479
regulations and most lawyers would it

2258
01:36:15,039 --> 01:36:20,079
says that you have to apply gas

2259
01:36:17,479 --> 01:36:23,759
chromatography which as you know will

2260
01:36:20,079 --> 01:36:26,158
decarbox your thca and convert it into t

2261
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:29,840
see so there is no real loophole there

2262
01:36:26,158 --> 01:36:32,799
but you'll see like cookies and other

2263
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:36,520
brands like this Mark selling oh yeah

2264
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:38,360
t8c diamonds that gram at a time and it

2265
01:36:36,520 --> 01:36:40,360
depends like some State like Vermont

2266
01:36:38,359 --> 01:36:42,799
doesn't allow it so you can't ship it

2267
01:36:40,359 --> 01:36:45,319
into Vermont but in certain States you

2268
01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:46,760
could ship that [ __ ] over line overstate

2269
01:36:45,319 --> 01:36:50,000
lines and the other thing that's

2270
01:36:46,760 --> 01:36:52,760
happening is they're taking cheap bulk

2271
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:55,039
pemp that's grown outdoors and they're

2272
01:36:52,760 --> 01:36:57,039
spraying it and not only spraying it

2273
01:36:55,039 --> 01:37:01,238
they're actually adding

2274
01:36:57,039 --> 01:37:04,600
thca isolate so you could actually add

2275
01:37:01,238 --> 01:37:06,678
thca isolate to have flour and then

2276
01:37:04,600 --> 01:37:08,719
putting it into the pre-roll I mean how

2277
01:37:06,679 --> 01:37:10,239
[ __ ] up is the market that that's

2278
01:37:08,719 --> 01:37:13,880
that's like throwing sand down at the

2279
01:37:10,238 --> 01:37:15,439
beach right like so can I explain the

2280
01:37:13,880 --> 01:37:20,039
way that they actually do get that

2281
01:37:15,439 --> 01:37:22,399
loophole and and so the the testing of

2282
01:37:20,039 --> 01:37:27,439
the flow is a

2283
01:37:22,399 --> 01:37:29,000
USDA um um umbrella so and that has a 30

2284
01:37:27,439 --> 01:37:31,879
day Harvest

2285
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:34,639
window so you need to test 30 days

2286
01:37:31,880 --> 01:37:38,400
before Harvest to show that you're at

2287
01:37:34,639 --> 01:37:39,400
below 3% Delta 9 and that is combined

2288
01:37:38,399 --> 01:37:42,039
total

2289
01:37:39,399 --> 01:37:46,879
THC right so that's where that's where

2290
01:37:42,039 --> 01:37:49,760
it gets decarbo decarbo decarbox so if

2291
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:51,639
you're growing a 60-day variety I know

2292
01:37:49,760 --> 01:37:52,880
everyone is going to like just like Jaws

2293
01:37:51,639 --> 01:37:56,159
are going to drop but if you're going a

2294
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:59,000
60-day variety and you send in your

2295
01:37:56,158 --> 01:38:00,158
Harvest sample at day 30 there's not a

2296
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:03,599
lot on the

2297
01:38:00,158 --> 01:38:06,960
plant okay so then you pass your Delta 9

2298
01:38:03,599 --> 01:38:09,880
USDA inspection right so then you go to

2299
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:12,079
full Harvest on that plant and you

2300
01:38:09,880 --> 01:38:14,960
harvest it and now you know that you're

2301
01:38:12,079 --> 01:38:18,238
way over on the total THC right because

2302
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:20,880
you now got a right plant USDA it's no

2303
01:38:18,238 --> 01:38:23,000
longer in their purview now all that

2304
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:27,359
needs to happen is that your COA has to

2305
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:30,118
show that you're at 3% Delta 9 so now

2306
01:38:27,359 --> 01:38:33,399
the thca number regardless of whether

2307
01:38:30,118 --> 01:38:36,039
it's a total THC it never gets decarbox

2308
01:38:33,399 --> 01:38:37,679
elated because it's separate so now all

2309
01:38:36,039 --> 01:38:40,079
you got to do is keep the supply chain

2310
01:38:37,679 --> 01:38:42,719
cold enough that your. three never goes

2311
01:38:40,079 --> 01:38:44,599
over3 yeah and now you can sell that all

2312
01:38:42,719 --> 01:38:47,000
over the place even though your total

2313
01:38:44,599 --> 01:38:50,199
combined could be in the 30s it could be

2314
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:52,639
all over the place so it's a ridiculous

2315
01:38:50,198 --> 01:38:54,960
loophole and and it's all about the

2316
01:38:52,639 --> 01:38:57,239
Harvest window but the other thing that

2317
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:59,560
I I I I find interesting because there

2318
01:38:57,238 --> 01:39:01,559
the guy Rod Knight the attorney who's

2319
01:38:59,560 --> 01:39:03,159
had a lot of he's had he's the guy who's

2320
01:39:01,560 --> 01:39:06,800
been kind

2321
01:39:03,158 --> 01:39:08,479
of right yeah he he's he's the guy who's

2322
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:12,480
I think's on the cookies website but

2323
01:39:08,479 --> 01:39:15,678
basically the what he says is that even

2324
01:39:12,479 --> 01:39:19,759
though they only mention Delta 9 in the

2325
01:39:15,679 --> 01:39:22,118
farm bill they exclude a bunch of other

2326
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:23,960
things and the fact that they put an

2327
01:39:22,118 --> 01:39:27,479
exclusion in there

2328
01:39:23,960 --> 01:39:30,158
implies that there was it was on purpose

2329
01:39:27,479 --> 01:39:32,799
meaning if they excluded derivatives

2330
01:39:30,158 --> 01:39:34,920
they excluded alkaloids salts whatever

2331
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:38,480
other things they said let's give it

2332
01:39:34,920 --> 01:39:41,639
broad language so you're saying it's

2333
01:39:38,479 --> 01:39:43,198
only Delta 9 not all these other things

2334
01:39:41,639 --> 01:39:45,840
let's not mention what the other things

2335
01:39:43,198 --> 01:39:48,399
are but let's just say not all the other

2336
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:52,400
things you got to remember Mojave with

2337
01:39:48,399 --> 01:39:54,879
all due respect that he is a paid shill

2338
01:39:52,399 --> 01:39:57,359
for the hemp in

2339
01:39:54,880 --> 01:40:00,079
this guy is hey before we get to off off

2340
01:39:57,359 --> 01:40:01,799
off point Wade had his hand up so I want

2341
01:40:00,079 --> 01:40:03,679
him to be able to speak on what we were

2342
01:40:01,800 --> 01:40:06,920
talking about before we go too deep into

2343
01:40:03,679 --> 01:40:06,920
it and then we can get back to the page

2344
01:40:07,319 --> 01:40:14,679
shell because uh I just got to speak up

2345
01:40:11,238 --> 01:40:18,638
as a patient and a longtime advocate for

2346
01:40:14,679 --> 01:40:22,079
patients um on the one hand the ready

2347
01:40:18,639 --> 01:40:24,560
availability of hemp products if they

2348
01:40:22,079 --> 01:40:27,760
are free of contaminant is a real gift

2349
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:30,719
it's a boom to people it's inexpensive

2350
01:40:27,760 --> 01:40:33,599
etc etc the problem is as we've

2351
01:40:30,719 --> 01:40:36,880
discussed greed comes into it and people

2352
01:40:33,599 --> 01:40:39,840
will do whatever they can to create a

2353
01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:42,440
product that will sell and what's

2354
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:44,920
happening in the California Market is

2355
01:40:42,439 --> 01:40:47,559
the people who are good actors are being

2356
01:40:44,920 --> 01:40:50,560
undercut and undermined by the whole

2357
01:40:47,560 --> 01:40:53,560
hemp industry and the sad part is there

2358
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:55,360
are actors in The Hemp industry who are

2359
01:40:53,560 --> 01:40:58,080
good at this who are doing good work who

2360
01:40:55,359 --> 01:41:01,519
are creating good product but we don't

2361
01:40:58,079 --> 01:41:03,559
know who they are for sure and then if

2362
01:41:01,520 --> 01:41:06,320
you go into the legal

2363
01:41:03,560 --> 01:41:10,280
Market to what uh Mojave was talking

2364
01:41:06,319 --> 01:41:11,719
about with this thing down in La uh yeah

2365
01:41:10,279 --> 01:41:15,759
what we're seeing

2366
01:41:11,719 --> 01:41:18,639
is cannabis crops showing up with

2367
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:21,520
compounds that are not listed in the

2368
01:41:18,639 --> 01:41:24,159
prohibited compounds under California

2369
01:41:21,520 --> 01:41:26,239
law they're not even they're they're

2370
01:41:24,158 --> 01:41:28,158
prohibited under federal law so of

2371
01:41:26,238 --> 01:41:30,919
course California didn't call them out

2372
01:41:28,158 --> 01:41:32,279
extra but they're showing up in cannabis

2373
01:41:30,920 --> 01:41:34,480
that's in legal

2374
01:41:32,279 --> 01:41:35,719
dispensaries because California law

2375
01:41:34,479 --> 01:41:39,718
doesn't

2376
01:41:35,719 --> 01:41:41,319
require producers to test for that

2377
01:41:39,719 --> 01:41:43,840
particular

2378
01:41:41,319 --> 01:41:45,920
contaminant and I and I'm I know I'm

2379
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:48,719
ranting I may not be making a lot of

2380
01:41:45,920 --> 01:41:51,480
sense but to me the real tragedy here is

2381
01:41:48,719 --> 01:41:55,800
again prohibition has created all of

2382
01:41:51,479 --> 01:41:58,638
this crazy [ __ ] that is not serving

2383
01:41:55,800 --> 01:42:01,800
anyone other than maybe some bureaucrats

2384
01:41:58,639 --> 01:42:06,440
who are looking to keep a job

2385
01:42:01,800 --> 01:42:08,440
um yeah I grow your own and do it

2386
01:42:06,439 --> 01:42:10,559
regeneratively you can make your own

2387
01:42:08,439 --> 01:42:13,279
medicine fairly

2388
01:42:10,560 --> 01:42:15,520
easily I'll stop there and if you can't

2389
01:42:13,279 --> 01:42:17,519
do it come to Nevada county in

2390
01:42:15,520 --> 01:42:20,719
California there's a whole bunch of

2391
01:42:17,520 --> 01:42:24,119
regenerative practitioners right here

2392
01:42:20,719 --> 01:42:26,599
and I'll I'll stop there much love

2393
01:42:24,118 --> 01:42:28,559
awesome thanks W all right back to the

2394
01:42:26,599 --> 01:42:31,960
page

2395
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:34,639
shill no exactly and and that I think

2396
01:42:31,960 --> 01:42:37,079
that that the point that that we're all

2397
01:42:34,639 --> 01:42:38,520
seeing is that is it a loophole and how

2398
01:42:37,079 --> 01:42:40,599
long are people going to profit during

2399
01:42:38,520 --> 01:42:42,800
the loophole and then what's going to

2400
01:42:40,599 --> 01:42:44,279
come on the other side because it

2401
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:46,199
something will and they'll definitely

2402
01:42:44,279 --> 01:42:48,880
ratify it or change it because there's a

2403
01:42:46,198 --> 01:42:51,198
it's kind of cuckoo but and also just to

2404
01:42:48,880 --> 01:42:53,480
to follow up on what Wade said all the

2405
01:42:51,198 --> 01:42:55,279
the HP products and the thca products

2406
01:42:53,479 --> 01:42:58,799
and the thcp and all the different

2407
01:42:55,279 --> 01:43:01,439
things that are sold all over La at head

2408
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:04,159
shops those are dirtier than the flow

2409
01:43:01,439 --> 01:43:06,319
than the products that were tested so it

2410
01:43:04,158 --> 01:43:08,198
let's not assume that the hemp versions

2411
01:43:06,319 --> 01:43:10,000
that are being sold in gas stations and

2412
01:43:08,198 --> 01:43:12,479
stuff are cleaner than the state

2413
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:14,198
regulated stuff that was really dirty so

2414
01:43:12,479 --> 01:43:16,399
it's like they're not even being tested

2415
01:43:14,198 --> 01:43:19,719
they don't even have it's just wild wild

2416
01:43:16,399 --> 01:43:22,399
west so it's it's just kind of mess and

2417
01:43:19,719 --> 01:43:24,039
you know it's yeah I I don't even know

2418
01:43:22,399 --> 01:43:25,479
what to say about

2419
01:43:24,039 --> 01:43:28,118
there there's a gentleman in the chat

2420
01:43:25,479 --> 01:43:31,079
named Dennis K he he wrote the loophole

2421
01:43:28,118 --> 01:43:32,759
was almost 30 pages that defined D9 as

2422
01:43:31,079 --> 01:43:35,639
the controlled substance that's not a

2423
01:43:32,760 --> 01:43:37,960
loophole that's an intentional act He

2424
01:43:35,639 --> 01:43:40,039
also mentioned while you were talking

2425
01:43:37,960 --> 01:43:42,840
about how to keep the numbers down he

2426
01:43:40,039 --> 01:43:44,840
said I run a grow in Wisconsin we test

2427
01:43:42,840 --> 01:43:49,039
our plants at week two of flower to get

2428
01:43:44,840 --> 01:43:51,239
less than 3% thca D Delta 9 then do an

2429
01:43:49,039 --> 01:43:55,039
independent Freeze Drive sample at week

2430
01:43:51,238 --> 01:43:57,879
nine to get a clean COA just prior to

2431
01:43:55,039 --> 01:43:59,960
harvest so just wanted to throw that in

2432
01:43:57,880 --> 01:44:05,039
he seemed to have some knowledge uh in

2433
01:43:59,960 --> 01:44:07,840
regards to uh well so so like like with

2434
01:44:05,039 --> 01:44:11,158
um with the regulation at harvest the

2435
01:44:07,840 --> 01:44:14,480
usda's regulation ends so like if you

2436
01:44:11,158 --> 01:44:19,279
wanted to produce corn and produce cans

2437
01:44:14,479 --> 01:44:22,158
of corn then you would need to build a

2438
01:44:19,279 --> 01:44:25,399
factory where your Productions of cans

2439
01:44:22,158 --> 01:44:26,960
of corn are Reg ulated under FDA

2440
01:44:25,399 --> 01:44:29,039
guidelines because you're now taking

2441
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:33,520
that harvested crop and you're turning

2442
01:44:29,039 --> 01:44:35,920
it into food right and so this is where

2443
01:44:33,520 --> 01:44:38,119
the ball has been dropped which is that

2444
01:44:35,920 --> 01:44:41,440
the Food and Drug Administration is

2445
01:44:38,118 --> 01:44:43,759
supposed to regulate crops after they're

2446
01:44:41,439 --> 01:44:47,879
harvested because that's where the USDA

2447
01:44:43,760 --> 01:44:50,079
sort of washes their hands and so with

2448
01:44:47,880 --> 01:44:53,118
no regulatory

2449
01:44:50,079 --> 01:44:55,079
pathway that's compliant to bring CBD

2450
01:44:53,118 --> 01:44:58,639
products to Market what did they expect

2451
01:44:55,079 --> 01:45:00,439
to happen so so now all this CBD was

2452
01:44:58,639 --> 01:45:03,279
produced you know the beginning of the

2453
01:45:00,439 --> 01:45:07,118
farm bill a kilogram of CBD was like

2454
01:45:03,279 --> 01:45:09,679
$7,000 a kilogram then uh maybe a year

2455
01:45:07,118 --> 01:45:12,158
later it was about 2,000 bucks a

2456
01:45:09,679 --> 01:45:17,480
kilogram now that same kilogram is down

2457
01:45:12,158 --> 01:45:21,158
to $200 a kilogram so the conversion of

2458
01:45:17,479 --> 01:45:25,879
CBD into THC has been known for a long

2459
01:45:21,158 --> 01:45:30,279
time um and and you know it's not a

2460
01:45:25,880 --> 01:45:32,199
clean process and it depends on how well

2461
01:45:30,279 --> 01:45:35,359
engineered that process is you're going

2462
01:45:32,198 --> 01:45:37,198
to get multiple products um to say that

2463
01:45:35,359 --> 01:45:39,479
we don't know what's in these products

2464
01:45:37,198 --> 01:45:43,960
is not entirely accurate because if you

2465
01:45:39,479 --> 01:45:48,279
look at uh like Josh swier from Affinity

2466
01:45:43,960 --> 01:45:51,679
in San Diego for one or or Chris hudalla

2467
01:45:48,279 --> 01:45:54,639
from um from Pro in Massachusetts

2468
01:45:51,679 --> 01:45:57,760
they'll show you on the COA that they

2469
01:45:54,639 --> 01:46:01,520
test for all these non-natural isomers

2470
01:45:57,760 --> 01:46:05,360
not all of them but like things like ISO

2471
01:46:01,520 --> 01:46:07,800
Delta 8 and ISO Delta 48 there's now

2472
01:46:05,359 --> 01:46:10,920
certified reference materials so third

2473
01:46:07,800 --> 01:46:13,440
parties can basically test for those

2474
01:46:10,920 --> 01:46:15,800
those things and so people like Josh

2475
01:46:13,439 --> 01:46:19,559
will tell you that yeah I could

2476
01:46:15,800 --> 01:46:23,480
distinguish a synthetic THC that's been

2477
01:46:19,560 --> 01:46:25,280
chemically derived versus a natural th C

2478
01:46:23,479 --> 01:46:27,118
which has been extracted from cannabis

2479
01:46:25,279 --> 01:46:30,039
plants which I think is where we all

2480
01:46:27,118 --> 01:46:33,238
want to be but this synthetic thing kind

2481
01:46:30,039 --> 01:46:36,359
of popped up because of what Wade

2482
01:46:33,238 --> 01:46:38,399
mentioned the one word greed but it also

2483
01:46:36,359 --> 01:46:41,198
mentioned from the fact that they

2484
01:46:38,399 --> 01:46:44,638
unleash this 800 pound gorilla in the

2485
01:46:41,198 --> 01:46:47,399
room which is the hemp industry without

2486
01:46:44,639 --> 01:46:50,000
properly contemplating how to properly

2487
01:46:47,399 --> 01:46:52,439
regulate it you know it's not a drug

2488
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:54,840
well I guess epidex is a drug it's AED

2489
01:46:52,439 --> 01:46:56,839
drug that you can get a prescription for

2490
01:46:54,840 --> 01:46:59,079
that you can buy at a drugstore yeah

2491
01:46:56,840 --> 01:47:02,440
that's an approved drug but cannabis for

2492
01:46:59,079 --> 01:47:05,118
the mo most part is a medicated herb

2493
01:47:02,439 --> 01:47:08,439
right and and they need to come up with

2494
01:47:05,118 --> 01:47:10,238
sensible regulation and even FDA threw

2495
01:47:08,439 --> 01:47:12,519
up their hands and said yeah this

2496
01:47:10,238 --> 01:47:14,879
doesn't really fit into our

2497
01:47:12,520 --> 01:47:17,239
monomolecular medicine model which you

2498
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:19,679
take a active ingredient through

2499
01:47:17,238 --> 01:47:21,638
clinical trials to show that

2500
01:47:19,679 --> 01:47:23,560
statistically the outcome for that

2501
01:47:21,639 --> 01:47:26,159
patient works better when they take that

2502
01:47:23,560 --> 01:47:28,119
medicine at this particular dose well

2503
01:47:26,158 --> 01:47:30,319
cannabis doesn't work like that right

2504
01:47:28,118 --> 01:47:32,359
and if michul teaches us anything

2505
01:47:30,319 --> 01:47:34,198
teaches us it's not just about the

2506
01:47:32,359 --> 01:47:35,880
single ingredient it's about all the

2507
01:47:34,198 --> 01:47:37,799
ingredients that are in there and

2508
01:47:35,880 --> 01:47:40,319
everything that we like about the

2509
01:47:37,800 --> 01:47:42,639
varieties that you guys breed and the

2510
01:47:40,319 --> 01:47:43,519
hash that you guys make I mean it's just

2511
01:47:42,639 --> 01:47:46,279
it's an

2512
01:47:43,520 --> 01:47:49,880
incredible thing but it can't be

2513
01:47:46,279 --> 01:47:52,238
regulated and I think the hemp industry

2514
01:47:49,880 --> 01:47:55,079
and the Cannabis industry are fighting

2515
01:47:52,238 --> 01:47:58,198
at one another and in some estimates

2516
01:47:55,079 --> 01:48:00,599
they they they size that that hemp

2517
01:47:58,198 --> 01:48:03,559
industry is being greater than 60

2518
01:48:00,599 --> 01:48:06,119
billion dollars you know that's that's

2519
01:48:03,560 --> 01:48:08,159
greater than all of the collective

2520
01:48:06,118 --> 01:48:10,559
cannabis Industries in all the different

2521
01:48:08,158 --> 01:48:12,158
states you add all that together the

2522
01:48:10,560 --> 01:48:14,880
hemp industry is bigger than that

2523
01:48:12,158 --> 01:48:16,598
because large addressable Market

2524
01:48:14,880 --> 01:48:19,199
everything's about cost everything's

2525
01:48:16,599 --> 01:48:20,960
about making the cheapest thing that

2526
01:48:19,198 --> 01:48:23,759
suffices out

2527
01:48:20,960 --> 01:48:25,840
there you you you know how do you how do

2528
01:48:23,760 --> 01:48:27,880
you tie that together somehow you got to

2529
01:48:25,840 --> 01:48:29,800
figure out a way to tie that together

2530
01:48:27,880 --> 01:48:32,599
big beverage is now in here because of

2531
01:48:29,800 --> 01:48:35,480
what's Happening places like Minnesota

2532
01:48:32,599 --> 01:48:37,560
so now you have you know these canning

2533
01:48:35,479 --> 01:48:40,479
lines that could make literally

2534
01:48:37,560 --> 01:48:44,320
thousands of cans in hour of this hemp

2535
01:48:40,479 --> 01:48:46,759
dve D9 10 milligram beverage I tell you

2536
01:48:44,319 --> 01:48:50,279
when it's not emulsified Mark even

2537
01:48:46,760 --> 01:48:52,560
seasoned THC users like us I can taste

2538
01:48:50,279 --> 01:48:54,639
it about halfway through the can I have

2539
01:48:52,560 --> 01:48:57,599
like whoa holy [ __ ] that

2540
01:48:54,639 --> 01:48:59,960
nanoemulsification really does something

2541
01:48:57,599 --> 01:49:02,760
to the biological activity and the onset

2542
01:48:59,960 --> 01:49:05,439
of activity so I'll stop there but I

2543
01:49:02,760 --> 01:49:07,679
just think that yeah Mojave I don't know

2544
01:49:05,439 --> 01:49:10,198
what you're seeing in California but

2545
01:49:07,679 --> 01:49:12,639
everywhere else in the United States the

2546
01:49:10,198 --> 01:49:16,279
Cannabis industry and the profitability

2547
01:49:12,639 --> 01:49:20,440
are in the toilet because they have to

2548
01:49:16,279 --> 01:49:22,238
compete with this unwieldy hemp industry

2549
01:49:20,439 --> 01:49:24,719
which I I think they're losing the

2550
01:49:22,238 --> 01:49:24,718
battle

2551
01:49:25,760 --> 01:49:30,599
I think the hemp Farmers too if they

2552
01:49:27,479 --> 01:49:34,238
only really understood that you

2553
01:49:30,599 --> 01:49:36,719
know there's huge money in the grain of

2554
01:49:34,238 --> 01:49:40,799
the plant like here in Canada our hemp

2555
01:49:36,719 --> 01:49:43,198
industry is not CBD it's just not a big

2556
01:49:40,800 --> 01:49:45,360
part of what we do we grow grain we grow

2557
01:49:43,198 --> 01:49:48,479
the seed and then the seed gets either

2558
01:49:45,359 --> 01:49:51,079
crushed into oil or it gets dehaul and

2559
01:49:48,479 --> 01:49:54,439
and sold as hemp parts and that that is

2560
01:49:51,079 --> 01:49:56,719
a a massive business right right which

2561
01:49:54,439 --> 01:49:59,519
is not a drug variety you're not you're

2562
01:49:56,719 --> 01:50:03,239
not growing a canopy right it's just

2563
01:49:59,520 --> 01:50:07,199
completely different I think actually it

2564
01:50:03,238 --> 01:50:08,839
actually follows the law I don't know

2565
01:50:07,198 --> 01:50:11,319
Mojave don't you think that that the

2566
01:50:08,840 --> 01:50:13,719
people in Washington were snookered on

2567
01:50:11,319 --> 01:50:16,960
what exactly what Mark is saying I think

2568
01:50:13,719 --> 01:50:20,800
that they viewed pemp as being this

2569
01:50:16,960 --> 01:50:23,399
industrial grain that makes seed oil uh

2570
01:50:20,800 --> 01:50:25,880
by the way there's new studies that show

2571
01:50:23,399 --> 01:50:28,559
what we predicted back on H hash Church

2572
01:50:25,880 --> 01:50:30,800
many years ago uh that if you feed hemp

2573
01:50:28,560 --> 01:50:33,880
seeds to chicken those chickens are

2574
01:50:30,800 --> 01:50:35,920
healthier well now Tyson has got that

2575
01:50:33,880 --> 01:50:38,560
data and it's just yeah it's a wonderful

2576
01:50:35,920 --> 01:50:41,599
we predicted it on hash church weits

2577
01:50:38,560 --> 01:50:45,800
claic but yeah I think our government

2578
01:50:41,599 --> 01:50:50,560
was thinking steed's oil rope they did

2579
01:50:45,800 --> 01:50:52,239
not contemplate CBD right I and if

2580
01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:53,599
Robert here he would say because we've

2581
01:50:52,238 --> 01:50:55,759
written about about this quite a bit is

2582
01:50:53,599 --> 01:50:58,159
just simply what is hemp because that's

2583
01:50:55,760 --> 01:51:01,719
that's the big discussion in the US and

2584
01:50:58,158 --> 01:51:04,679
I've consulted in Minnesota for the past

2585
01:51:01,719 --> 01:51:06,679
almost four years now and it's pretty

2586
01:51:04,679 --> 01:51:08,599
weird the transition that's happened

2587
01:51:06,679 --> 01:51:10,880
there and it's kind of like become this

2588
01:51:08,599 --> 01:51:14,000
petri dish for what is cannabis what is

2589
01:51:10,880 --> 01:51:18,880
The Big C genus cannabis because it

2590
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:21,560
started as um a no flower medical only

2591
01:51:18,880 --> 01:51:24,920
state where it was just Vapes and

2592
01:51:21,560 --> 01:51:28,039
gummies in the in the Delta 9 world and

2593
01:51:24,920 --> 01:51:29,319
then quickly CBD became a thing and

2594
01:51:28,039 --> 01:51:30,679
people wanted to grow but they didn't

2595
01:51:29,319 --> 01:51:32,719
know like what they did literally

2596
01:51:30,679 --> 01:51:35,000
farmers were growing plants they didn't

2597
01:51:32,719 --> 01:51:36,639
even the farmers themselves didn't know

2598
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:39,238
what the downstream product they were

2599
01:51:36,639 --> 01:51:42,118
making was someone just literally showed

2600
01:51:39,238 --> 01:51:43,799
up and said hey plant these seeds it's

2601
01:51:42,118 --> 01:51:46,960
going to be good for you and they kind

2602
01:51:43,800 --> 01:51:50,480
of had an idea so is it CBD is it fiber

2603
01:51:46,960 --> 01:51:52,760
is it is it grain it was literally that

2604
01:51:50,479 --> 01:51:55,238
confusing and I can tell you stories got

2605
01:51:52,760 --> 01:51:57,719
literal harvests where people backed

2606
01:51:55,238 --> 01:52:00,279
semis filled with plants into big

2607
01:51:57,719 --> 01:52:01,760
manufacturing floors and they didn't

2608
01:52:00,279 --> 01:52:04,920
even know what was the product that was

2609
01:52:01,760 --> 01:52:07,079
going to be made because they jumped so

2610
01:52:04,920 --> 01:52:09,000
fast as Farmers like hey we grow plants

2611
01:52:07,078 --> 01:52:12,359
and they say this is a big economic boom

2612
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:15,078
in this anyway over the years it's

2613
01:52:12,359 --> 01:52:18,639
transitioned to the most almost the most

2614
01:52:15,078 --> 01:52:20,479
liberal model for cannabis on Earth I

2615
01:52:18,639 --> 01:52:24,279
mean I drive from Minnesota gas station

2616
01:52:20,479 --> 01:52:27,078
to gas station every single gas station

2617
01:52:24,279 --> 01:52:30,479
is selling cannabis Beverages and Vapes

2618
01:52:27,078 --> 01:52:33,840
gummies you can get you can get cannabis

2619
01:52:30,479 --> 01:52:36,039
beverages on tap at a bar in

2620
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:37,400
Minnesota which I don't even understand

2621
01:52:36,039 --> 01:52:40,078
how that works because they do have

2622
01:52:37,399 --> 01:52:42,000
regulations on per serving amounts and

2623
01:52:40,078 --> 01:52:44,960
it on tap it's pretty vague what 16

2624
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:47,118
ounces is or 12 or and anyway and they

2625
01:52:44,960 --> 01:52:50,840
have adult use you can grow up to eight

2626
01:52:47,118 --> 01:52:53,679
plants at Home they've been incredibly

2627
01:52:50,840 --> 01:52:55,360
um uh for Ward thinking in their social

2628
01:52:53,679 --> 01:52:58,279
Equity program with the tribal

2629
01:52:55,359 --> 01:53:01,679
relationship in terms of giving tribes

2630
01:52:58,279 --> 01:53:03,399
uh a head start into the wck market um

2631
01:53:01,679 --> 01:53:05,118
that being said the whole thing is still

2632
01:53:03,399 --> 01:53:07,679
wacky because it's an island in the

2633
01:53:05,118 --> 01:53:10,399
middle of this big crazy continent of

2634
01:53:07,679 --> 01:53:13,279
cannabis laws and they also have a

2635
01:53:10,399 --> 01:53:16,078
interstate commerce band on what can and

2636
01:53:13,279 --> 01:53:18,599
can come in but the far out thing is

2637
01:53:16,078 --> 01:53:21,559
just like like um other states it's not

2638
01:53:18,599 --> 01:53:24,319
based off of federal DEA guidelines it's

2639
01:53:21,560 --> 01:53:27,440
their own like in like in California you

2640
01:53:24,319 --> 01:53:29,799
can't order order a BB gun on Amazon

2641
01:53:27,439 --> 01:53:31,238
right they'll ship it to you in other

2642
01:53:29,800 --> 01:53:32,880
states but you can't order one because

2643
01:53:31,238 --> 01:53:35,598
that's just a California law we don't

2644
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:37,199
take BB guns online you know and

2645
01:53:35,599 --> 01:53:40,440
Minnesota's like well we also don't take

2646
01:53:37,198 --> 01:53:42,759
thca online it's like it's not whether

2647
01:53:40,439 --> 01:53:44,638
thca is legal in the state or whether

2648
01:53:42,760 --> 01:53:46,480
it's legal wherever but we just have a

2649
01:53:44,639 --> 01:53:48,440
ban on Imports because they know how

2650
01:53:46,479 --> 01:53:51,078
threatening it is to their emerging

2651
01:53:48,439 --> 01:53:54,118
market that California Colorado and

2652
01:53:51,078 --> 01:53:55,759
Oklahoma who are now not even you know

2653
01:53:54,118 --> 01:53:58,719
now and that's this is the big question

2654
01:53:55,760 --> 01:54:00,400
mark is that it's CBD is so cheap

2655
01:53:58,719 --> 01:54:04,078
because people grew so much that they

2656
01:54:00,399 --> 01:54:07,039
couldn't sell or process are they now

2657
01:54:04,078 --> 01:54:11,078
going to be growing

2658
01:54:07,039 --> 01:54:15,238
thca instead of high CBD varieties in

2659
01:54:11,078 --> 01:54:17,519
order to just circumvent the processing

2660
01:54:15,238 --> 01:54:20,198
completely and is that going to be the

2661
01:54:17,520 --> 01:54:22,719
new Farm built crop in these states that

2662
01:54:20,198 --> 01:54:25,879
are still

2663
01:54:22,719 --> 01:54:27,800
well the the the problem with well

2664
01:54:25,880 --> 01:54:29,599
there's there's there's lots of problems

2665
01:54:27,800 --> 01:54:33,159
there you know I I I come from the

2666
01:54:29,599 --> 01:54:36,520
regulated cannabis world you know I I

2667
01:54:33,158 --> 01:54:39,839
know about the hemp world but I'm more

2668
01:54:36,520 --> 01:54:42,960
along the lines of like you know getting

2669
01:54:39,840 --> 01:54:44,960
licensed operations growing you know and

2670
01:54:42,960 --> 01:54:46,800
we have to do background checks on all

2671
01:54:44,960 --> 01:54:50,039
of our employees we have to have

2672
01:54:46,800 --> 01:54:52,440
security cameras 247 you know the whole

2673
01:54:50,039 --> 01:54:54,719
nine yards I mean this is like the

2674
01:54:52,439 --> 01:54:56,759
cannabis industry treat it like nuclear

2675
01:54:54,719 --> 01:54:59,880
waste kind of [ __ ] believe me I'm not

2676
01:54:56,760 --> 01:55:01,800
about the or over orous regul

2677
01:54:59,880 --> 01:55:05,078
regulations that apply that they apply

2678
01:55:01,800 --> 01:55:09,239
to it but if you look at it again I I

2679
01:55:05,078 --> 01:55:13,759
don't think the intention of when

2680
01:55:09,238 --> 01:55:15,959
Congress passed the farm bill was to

2681
01:55:13,760 --> 01:55:19,520
unleash active pharmaceutical

2682
01:55:15,960 --> 01:55:21,639
ingredients on the farm I I I just don't

2683
01:55:19,520 --> 01:55:23,800
think that that was the case and I I I

2684
01:55:21,639 --> 01:55:27,599
don't think again they P I think they

2685
01:55:23,800 --> 01:55:29,920
were snookered on seeds and rope and oil

2686
01:55:27,599 --> 01:55:32,520
I don't think they ever thought about

2687
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:35,920
you know the CBD versus THC and

2688
01:55:32,520 --> 01:55:39,119
converting CBD into THC hell that

2689
01:55:35,920 --> 01:55:42,039
chemistry is as old as Roger Adams so

2690
01:55:39,118 --> 01:55:44,960
the the the worst thing is that is that

2691
01:55:42,039 --> 01:55:48,279
there's products like thcp which don't

2692
01:55:44,960 --> 01:55:51,000
come from hemp and don't come from CBD

2693
01:55:48,279 --> 01:55:53,039
that are just completely synthetic and

2694
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:55,880
if they're completely synthetic well now

2695
01:55:53,039 --> 01:55:58,399
where can you get completely synthetic

2696
01:55:55,880 --> 01:56:00,760
active ingredients Pharmaceuticals made

2697
01:55:58,399 --> 01:56:02,198
places like China and India so now it's

2698
01:56:00,760 --> 01:56:04,520
just you know

2699
01:56:02,198 --> 01:56:06,399
again these are these aren't being

2700
01:56:04,520 --> 01:56:08,280
extracted from plants that are grown in

2701
01:56:06,399 --> 01:56:10,439
the ground they're chemicals that are

2702
01:56:08,279 --> 01:56:13,559
made in the laboratory that are

2703
01:56:10,439 --> 01:56:15,399
exploiting the wonderful activity and

2704
01:56:13,560 --> 01:56:17,760
safety really of

2705
01:56:15,399 --> 01:56:20,879
phytochemicals but I've heard from a few

2706
01:56:17,760 --> 01:56:23,239
people that have tried this thcp thing

2707
01:56:20,880 --> 01:56:25,840
and it is serious business it like puts

2708
01:56:23,238 --> 01:56:27,718
you down in your chair and like for two

2709
01:56:25,840 --> 01:56:30,360
days you don't want to smoke anything or

2710
01:56:27,719 --> 01:56:32,800
be around any like weed and it's like

2711
01:56:30,359 --> 01:56:35,198
that's not a very pleasurable experience

2712
01:56:32,800 --> 01:56:37,719
yeah can you turn up the volume of

2713
01:56:35,198 --> 01:56:39,759
compounds that can agonize your C CB1

2714
01:56:37,719 --> 01:56:42,760
receptors absolutely that's the way

2715
01:56:39,760 --> 01:56:44,159
Medicinal Chemistry works but there's

2716
01:56:42,760 --> 01:56:46,560
something that's great about the

2717
01:56:44,158 --> 01:56:49,638
cannabis plant is it's got more than

2718
01:56:46,560 --> 01:56:51,400
just THC right so you'll know that your

2719
01:56:49,639 --> 01:56:54,239
experience with cannabis doesn't

2720
01:56:51,399 --> 01:56:57,000
necessarily have have to do with the THC

2721
01:56:54,238 --> 01:56:59,559
level the reason why the THC level is so

2722
01:56:57,000 --> 01:57:02,238
important in Commerce is because of

2723
01:56:59,560 --> 01:57:04,079
prohibition and because like when

2724
01:57:02,238 --> 01:57:06,198
dispensaries and Distributors are doing

2725
01:57:04,078 --> 01:57:08,920
bulk buying and they're like gee am I

2726
01:57:06,198 --> 01:57:12,078
going to buy the 25% or am I going to

2727
01:57:08,920 --> 01:57:14,319
buy the stuff that analyzes for 15%

2728
01:57:12,078 --> 01:57:18,960
chances are the stuff that's analyzing

2729
01:57:14,319 --> 01:57:21,118
for 25% is really 15% they they're just

2730
01:57:18,960 --> 01:57:23,719
cherry-picking their data that they're

2731
01:57:21,118 --> 01:57:26,238
getting their COA is made on all this is

2732
01:57:23,719 --> 01:57:27,920
just an artifact of prohibition and I

2733
01:57:26,238 --> 01:57:32,238
think like the last thing just about the

2734
01:57:27,920 --> 01:57:33,760
hemp thing is that you know there's yeah

2735
01:57:32,238 --> 01:57:35,879
probably people who are going to listen

2736
01:57:33,760 --> 01:57:37,639
to what I say and say oh man you're

2737
01:57:35,880 --> 01:57:40,039
against the plant you're against taking

2738
01:57:37,639 --> 01:57:42,239
it's like no I'm all about the plant but

2739
01:57:40,039 --> 01:57:45,359
if people want cannabis and they want

2740
01:57:42,238 --> 01:57:48,519
thca they need to end prohibition

2741
01:57:45,359 --> 01:57:50,799
because only when prohibition is so I've

2742
01:57:48,520 --> 01:57:52,800
said this many times before as long as

2743
01:57:50,800 --> 01:57:55,039
there's prohibition everywhere

2744
01:57:52,800 --> 01:57:58,000
and anywhere there'll be a black market

2745
01:57:55,039 --> 01:58:00,198
everywhere and so like in California for

2746
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:02,359
example right it doesn't matter what the

2747
01:58:00,198 --> 01:58:04,919
laws are in California the laws are

2748
01:58:02,359 --> 01:58:07,719
[ __ ] up in other places so California

2749
01:58:04,920 --> 01:58:09,399
becomes basically the supply chain and I

2750
01:58:07,719 --> 01:58:11,439
think the worst thing that's happening

2751
01:58:09,399 --> 01:58:13,920
now again is that there's this war

2752
01:58:11,439 --> 01:58:16,039
between businesses that are trying to

2753
01:58:13,920 --> 01:58:18,039
get products out through the camp

2754
01:58:16,039 --> 01:58:21,078
channels versus cannabis channels

2755
01:58:18,039 --> 01:58:23,078
they're in law suits together right now

2756
01:58:21,078 --> 01:58:25,519
because again the folks in Southern

2757
01:58:23,078 --> 01:58:28,799
California because they've had to pay

2758
01:58:25,520 --> 01:58:30,880
large dollars to get their places

2759
01:58:28,800 --> 01:58:33,480
licensed and to get their places up and

2760
01:58:30,880 --> 01:58:35,760
running and now there's an unfair

2761
01:58:33,479 --> 01:58:37,799
competition from this you know

2762
01:58:35,760 --> 01:58:40,119
competitive landscape that's outside

2763
01:58:37,800 --> 01:58:42,520
their jurisdiction that's bringing cheap

2764
01:58:40,118 --> 01:58:44,839
products into their state you know it's

2765
01:58:42,520 --> 01:58:48,520
the perfect storm I it's going to be

2766
01:58:44,840 --> 01:58:51,279
interesting to see how this changes if

2767
01:58:48,520 --> 01:58:53,760
it changes at all in the next version of

2768
01:58:51,279 --> 01:58:56,519
the farm bill which as you know Mojave

2769
01:58:53,760 --> 01:58:59,280
they just kicked the can down the road

2770
01:58:56,520 --> 01:59:02,280
uh but you know it's an election year um

2771
01:58:59,279 --> 01:59:04,840
who knows maybe things will happen and

2772
01:59:02,279 --> 01:59:07,319
they'll end up deregulating the plant I

2773
01:59:04,840 --> 01:59:10,000
think moving to schedule three is an

2774
01:59:07,319 --> 01:59:10,759
absolute nonstarter because if you read

2775
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:14,039
the

2776
01:59:10,760 --> 01:59:16,639
regulations you you know none of the

2777
01:59:14,039 --> 01:59:19,000
Cannabis supply chain that exists today

2778
01:59:16,639 --> 01:59:21,599
would be compliant with schedule 3

2779
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:24,238
listing so I think this is basically an

2780
01:59:21,599 --> 01:59:28,599
invitation for big farmer to come in and

2781
01:59:24,238 --> 01:59:32,118
start acquiring msos that are positioned

2782
01:59:28,599 --> 01:59:34,119
to get you know their their GMP

2783
01:59:32,118 --> 01:59:35,839
certifications so I know I'm doing a lot

2784
01:59:34,118 --> 01:59:38,559
of talking here but yeah things are

2785
01:59:35,840 --> 01:59:41,039
[ __ ] up down in the states Mark but

2786
01:59:38,560 --> 01:59:43,679
you know hopefully everything will move

2787
01:59:41,039 --> 01:59:46,319
forward because of people's love for the

2788
01:59:43,679 --> 01:59:49,078
plant and I like to almost put it back

2789
01:59:46,319 --> 01:59:52,920
to like micr Brew I mean once you let

2790
01:59:49,078 --> 01:59:55,198
the micr Brew kind of bug out there were

2791
01:59:52,920 --> 01:59:57,520
no you know no going back for some of us

2792
01:59:55,198 --> 02:00:00,198
who will never drink Budweiser again

2793
01:59:57,520 --> 02:00:02,880
I'll only drink a locally brewed micr

2794
02:00:00,198 --> 02:00:05,319
Brew right so I think maybe with

2795
02:00:02,880 --> 02:00:08,159
cannabis again art artisan quality will

2796
02:00:05,319 --> 02:00:11,039
really come through on that and that'll

2797
02:00:08,158 --> 02:00:16,000
end up winning um

2798
02:00:11,039 --> 02:00:16,000
anyway so much about Walmart hemp and

2799
02:00:16,520 --> 02:00:21,599
cannabis give there's no shortage of it

2800
02:00:19,439 --> 02:00:23,279
for sure yeah it's it's always a balance

2801
02:00:21,599 --> 02:00:26,199
right you know the whole

2802
02:00:23,279 --> 02:00:30,000
time there's that I bet you most people

2803
02:00:26,198 --> 02:00:34,638
are happy with the vape pen gas station

2804
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:38,198
thcp diluted with CBN or whatever like I

2805
02:00:34,639 --> 02:00:40,840
I don't know I just we are the anomalies

2806
02:00:38,198 --> 02:00:42,439
our group is a special group that's like

2807
02:00:40,840 --> 02:00:45,000
you know part of a smaller group that

2808
02:00:42,439 --> 02:00:46,078
will grow just like I'm sure IPA beer

2809
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:48,920
has grown I don't know what the

2810
02:00:46,078 --> 02:00:52,039
percentage of IPA beer is versus like

2811
02:00:48,920 --> 02:00:55,880
Kors and Old Milwaukee and Budweiser

2812
02:00:52,039 --> 02:00:59,238
micro mean in general you mean like

2813
02:00:55,880 --> 02:01:01,920
locally brewed micro brew yeah compared

2814
02:00:59,238 --> 02:01:04,718
to big beer you know what do big beer

2815
02:01:01,920 --> 02:01:07,840
own of the beer industry is it like 50%

2816
02:01:04,719 --> 02:01:09,599
or is it like 80 or 90% I have no idea

2817
02:01:07,840 --> 02:01:12,360
that that's it

2818
02:01:09,599 --> 02:01:15,599
Marcus to my Costco down here and I

2819
02:01:12,359 --> 02:01:18,078
could certainly buy huge pallets of Bud

2820
02:01:15,599 --> 02:01:20,599
Light but right next to the Bud Light

2821
02:01:18,078 --> 02:01:22,519
there's locally brewed Vermont Beer

2822
02:01:20,599 --> 02:01:24,639
that's so much better right

2823
02:01:22,520 --> 02:01:28,480
so yeah but but people aren't buying it

2824
02:01:24,639 --> 02:01:30,480
by the pallet probably you probably not

2825
02:01:28,479 --> 02:01:32,879
it's gr it's growing we'll put it this

2826
02:01:30,479 --> 02:01:34,879
way it's funny because me and Rob write

2827
02:01:32,880 --> 02:01:37,279
a lot about the comparison between Hops

2828
02:01:34,880 --> 02:01:42,319
and cannabis and also the craft beer and

2829
02:01:37,279 --> 02:01:44,479
craft cannabis kind of um issues but um

2830
02:01:42,319 --> 02:01:46,599
as craft beer grew what what happened

2831
02:01:44,479 --> 02:01:48,799
Marcus was the big alcohol bought the

2832
02:01:46,599 --> 02:01:51,039
craft all the crafts companies so that

2833
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:52,679
so there are now that's why micro brew

2834
02:01:51,039 --> 02:01:54,560
became a thing you know and now it's

2835
02:01:52,679 --> 02:01:56,719
actually Nano Brew because even the

2836
02:01:54,560 --> 02:02:00,360
micro Brews are often owned by anheiser

2837
02:01:56,719 --> 02:02:02,439
Bush but but to that point it got them

2838
02:02:00,359 --> 02:02:04,880
and I say this you know it's like hey if

2839
02:02:02,439 --> 02:02:06,960
if uh you know if it made their beer

2840
02:02:04,880 --> 02:02:09,039
better and it expanded they said hey

2841
02:02:06,960 --> 02:02:13,000
we're aner Bush and we think we can sell

2842
02:02:09,039 --> 02:02:15,479
that to our customers as well then it it

2843
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:17,840
to me that's a better world and I think

2844
02:02:15,479 --> 02:02:19,479
our quality of canab the issue the big

2845
02:02:17,840 --> 02:02:21,920
issue to me is that cannabis is really

2846
02:02:19,479 --> 02:02:24,319
complex but growing it is just

2847
02:02:21,920 --> 02:02:26,039
Agriculture and as soon as we figure out

2848
02:02:24,319 --> 02:02:28,559
the growing part it's actually not a lot

2849
02:02:26,039 --> 02:02:31,399
harder to grow amazing cannabis that

2850
02:02:28,560 --> 02:02:34,320
tastes amazing and has a great effect

2851
02:02:31,399 --> 02:02:36,359
versus complete [ __ ] once they figure it

2852
02:02:34,319 --> 02:02:38,679
out it's like you can get I mean I can

2853
02:02:36,359 --> 02:02:40,519
go and buy blueberries from Chile or I

2854
02:02:38,679 --> 02:02:42,599
can buy an Apple from New Zealand and

2855
02:02:40,520 --> 02:02:46,000
it's perfect and it's like the whole

2856
02:02:42,599 --> 02:02:48,599
supply chain we can grow amazing weed

2857
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:50,560
for people and they can be big giant

2858
02:02:48,599 --> 02:02:52,078
corporations that will be involved and

2859
02:02:50,560 --> 02:02:54,280
there'll be small companies that'll be

2860
02:02:52,078 --> 02:02:56,078
involved but ultimately right now it's

2861
02:02:54,279 --> 02:02:58,960
just a mess because there's so

2862
02:02:56,078 --> 02:03:01,799
much data and so much transition going

2863
02:02:58,960 --> 02:03:04,399
on that people you know it just opens up

2864
02:03:01,800 --> 02:03:06,079
a can of worms but I do think like when

2865
02:03:04,399 --> 02:03:08,198
when like and that's one of the biggest

2866
02:03:06,078 --> 02:03:10,399
issues for me is like you can't hold the

2867
02:03:08,198 --> 02:03:13,118
plant to a higher standard than other

2868
02:03:10,399 --> 02:03:15,799
plants so you can't blame agriculture

2869
02:03:13,118 --> 02:03:18,238
for wanting to be involved you can't

2870
02:03:15,800 --> 02:03:19,639
blame business as usual for being

2871
02:03:18,238 --> 02:03:21,158
involved because that's just the way it

2872
02:03:19,639 --> 02:03:22,279
works we've always tried to normalize

2873
02:03:21,158 --> 02:03:23,920
the plant

2874
02:03:22,279 --> 02:03:25,719
but like we're supposed to be like the

2875
02:03:23,920 --> 02:03:28,840
Shepherds that make it through that

2876
02:03:25,719 --> 02:03:30,639
transition to hand the plant over to

2877
02:03:28,840 --> 02:03:33,360
those people who are going to take it

2878
02:03:30,639 --> 02:03:36,159
anyway like so we have a little bit of a

2879
02:03:33,359 --> 02:03:38,679
like protector kind of entitlement over

2880
02:03:36,158 --> 02:03:40,399
like shaping the future industry and the

2881
02:03:38,679 --> 02:03:42,639
cool thing is I think we can I think

2882
02:03:40,399 --> 02:03:45,638
like working with the right people

2883
02:03:42,639 --> 02:03:47,920
becoming successful with your Brands and

2884
02:03:45,639 --> 02:03:50,800
your genetics and all that [ __ ] really

2885
02:03:47,920 --> 02:03:53,559
shapes the future of cannabis so it's

2886
02:03:50,800 --> 02:03:56,119
like you know I just I don't I don't

2887
02:03:53,559 --> 02:03:57,960
think that you know it's all doom and

2888
02:03:56,118 --> 02:03:59,598
gloom I just think that it's going to be

2889
02:03:57,960 --> 02:04:01,920
a completely different thing on the

2890
02:03:59,599 --> 02:04:03,360
other side you know and that's cool

2891
02:04:01,920 --> 02:04:06,399
because that's what we all kind of

2892
02:04:03,359 --> 02:04:09,198
wanted you know it's just it's difficult

2893
02:04:06,399 --> 02:04:11,679
to hold the hand through the transition

2894
02:04:09,198 --> 02:04:13,238
and take the blows but you know we I

2895
02:04:11,679 --> 02:04:15,239
think if you look at if you look at like

2896
02:04:13,238 --> 02:04:18,439
what's happened in retail in general I

2897
02:04:15,238 --> 02:04:22,439
mean we've reduced it down to Costco

2898
02:04:18,439 --> 02:04:24,238
Walmart and Jeff Bezos right I mean the

2899
02:04:22,439 --> 02:04:27,118
the the whole

2900
02:04:24,238 --> 02:04:29,279
distribution business model I mean those

2901
02:04:27,118 --> 02:04:31,519
big corporations you talk about Mojave

2902
02:04:29,279 --> 02:04:35,479
those are the ones that are basically

2903
02:04:31,520 --> 02:04:38,440
predicated on roads and cheap gasoline

2904
02:04:35,479 --> 02:04:41,039
for their trucks to basically go from

2905
02:04:38,439 --> 02:04:43,558
their fulfillment centers out to those

2906
02:04:41,039 --> 02:04:45,519
stores and put all those goods and so

2907
02:04:43,559 --> 02:04:47,760
like when you're in Walmart and when

2908
02:04:45,520 --> 02:04:48,760
you're making Walmart purchase yeah it

2909
02:04:47,760 --> 02:04:51,679
would be

2910
02:04:48,760 --> 02:04:53,639
great like again I don't know when

2911
02:04:51,679 --> 02:04:55,679
Walmart and cannabis are going to team

2912
02:04:53,639 --> 02:04:58,000
up but when they do you know it's going

2913
02:04:55,679 --> 02:05:00,920
to be like yeah it's just going to be

2914
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:03,118
part of your shopping right like oh I

2915
02:05:00,920 --> 02:05:07,078
can get a pair of blue jeans I can get

2916
02:05:03,118 --> 02:05:09,118
motor oil I can get you know a pack of

2917
02:05:07,078 --> 02:05:12,679
chicken breast and oh yeah I can pick up

2918
02:05:09,118 --> 02:05:15,039
some weed all underneath One Roof

2919
02:05:12,679 --> 02:05:17,960
because they own that distribution

2920
02:05:15,039 --> 02:05:20,238
Channel and that's super powerful

2921
02:05:17,960 --> 02:05:23,118
because like when you're looking at like

2922
02:05:20,238 --> 02:05:25,959
dispensaries like I was giving some

2923
02:05:23,118 --> 02:05:27,558
advice to a client of mine around you

2924
02:05:25,960 --> 02:05:28,760
know they're like okay we gotta we gotta

2925
02:05:27,559 --> 02:05:30,760
think about where we want to put our

2926
02:05:28,760 --> 02:05:34,880
dispensaries I was like you know what

2927
02:05:30,760 --> 02:05:37,520
next to the BMW dealer you know you

2928
02:05:34,880 --> 02:05:40,118
right I mean it's like like today in

2929
02:05:37,520 --> 02:05:42,760
retail I mean you have to think about so

2930
02:05:40,118 --> 02:05:45,679
many different patterns about like how

2931
02:05:42,760 --> 02:05:48,199
humans purchase things and where humans

2932
02:05:45,679 --> 02:05:50,800
go to get things and my god when you're

2933
02:05:48,198 --> 02:05:53,558
sitting at the uh I don't know

2934
02:05:50,800 --> 02:05:55,520
McDonald's uh a drive-thru let's hope

2935
02:05:53,559 --> 02:05:57,239
you're not if you're watching the show

2936
02:05:55,520 --> 02:05:58,760
but you're looking at I don't know some

2937
02:05:57,238 --> 02:06:01,078
sign like hey you know what I'm going to

2938
02:05:58,760 --> 02:06:02,719
go pop over to that store because I just

2939
02:06:01,078 --> 02:06:04,599
was looking at that sign while I'm

2940
02:06:02,719 --> 02:06:08,239
sitting here waiting for my kids in

2941
02:06:04,599 --> 02:06:10,760
their Big Mac you know like today retail

2942
02:06:08,238 --> 02:06:12,558
is a completely different game it's

2943
02:06:10,760 --> 02:06:15,840
completely different just even in the

2944
02:06:12,559 --> 02:06:17,360
last four or five years and I I don't

2945
02:06:15,840 --> 02:06:20,319
know I mean like if you're going to

2946
02:06:17,359 --> 02:06:24,000
introduce like retail

2947
02:06:20,319 --> 02:06:25,639
cannabis I mean I mean my God as the

2948
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:28,078
companies that have put a lot of money

2949
02:06:25,639 --> 02:06:32,920
into their dispensaries you have to you

2950
02:06:28,078 --> 02:06:34,439
know really the again draw people in you

2951
02:06:32,920 --> 02:06:36,960
have to have aquariums you have to have

2952
02:06:34,439 --> 02:06:39,439
like nice couches and

2953
02:06:36,960 --> 02:06:41,800
everything what's the differentiator at

2954
02:06:39,439 --> 02:06:43,638
cannabis retail and ultimately like yeah

2955
02:06:41,800 --> 02:06:46,800
what are you up against someone just

2956
02:06:43,639 --> 02:06:48,559
putting an 8 vape pen on their credit

2957
02:06:46,800 --> 02:06:50,880
card you know that they're going to get

2958
02:06:48,559 --> 02:06:54,119
shipped to them a day later with their

2959
02:06:50,880 --> 02:06:56,199
Jeff BAS package from Amazon you know

2960
02:06:54,118 --> 02:06:58,479
it's a different retail Marketplace it

2961
02:06:56,198 --> 02:06:58,479
really

2962
02:06:58,559 --> 02:07:02,760
is yeah and you're not even getting into

2963
02:07:00,880 --> 02:07:04,760
predictive algorithms that actually

2964
02:07:02,760 --> 02:07:06,520
manipulate and predict the buying

2965
02:07:04,760 --> 02:07:08,840
patterns of the humans because it's not

2966
02:07:06,520 --> 02:07:11,320
just about fitting in and finding your

2967
02:07:08,840 --> 02:07:13,840
place that's a rabbit hole that unless

2968
02:07:11,319 --> 02:07:15,118
you're a complete and total sociopath

2969
02:07:13,840 --> 02:07:17,400
you probably don't really want to go

2970
02:07:15,118 --> 02:07:20,198
down that rabbit

2971
02:07:17,399 --> 02:07:23,000
hole well Marcus I I don't mean to make

2972
02:07:20,198 --> 02:07:25,319
cracks at like some celebrity branded

2973
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:27,319
cannabis but I I've always thought that

2974
02:07:25,319 --> 02:07:29,679
you know if you need celebrity branding

2975
02:07:27,319 --> 02:07:33,238
to sell your cannabis find better

2976
02:07:29,679 --> 02:07:34,880
cannabis right I mean like right I mean

2977
02:07:33,238 --> 02:07:36,678
don't you feel like that too in a way I

2978
02:07:34,880 --> 02:07:40,000
mean just like this whole branding thing

2979
02:07:36,679 --> 02:07:42,639
I mean you might buy that Bob Marley jar

2980
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:44,279
once right and now oh you got that nice

2981
02:07:42,639 --> 02:07:48,159
jar what do you do with it put it on the

2982
02:07:44,279 --> 02:07:50,118
Shelf with all your other J yeah for me

2983
02:07:48,158 --> 02:07:51,519
I'm more interested in the Branded ones

2984
02:07:50,118 --> 02:07:54,799
that like the name means something

2985
02:07:51,520 --> 02:07:57,079
something like a hash maker or a grower

2986
02:07:54,800 --> 02:07:59,760
or both who's doing you know what I mean

2987
02:07:57,078 --> 02:08:01,960
and that and at that point it's like uh

2988
02:07:59,760 --> 02:08:05,079
I I think of my brand more along in the

2989
02:08:01,960 --> 02:08:08,760
lines of that like people are like okay

2990
02:08:05,078 --> 02:08:10,880
this guy like sort of helped Pioneer the

2991
02:08:08,760 --> 02:08:13,559
water extraction thing it's been like

2992
02:08:10,880 --> 02:08:15,719
focused on producing quality what's that

2993
02:08:13,559 --> 02:08:18,960
has before hip hop

2994
02:08:15,719 --> 02:08:21,198
right right

2995
02:08:18,960 --> 02:08:23,520
exactly yeah well geez I think we've

2996
02:08:21,198 --> 02:08:25,919
done two hours I that was pretty good

2997
02:08:23,520 --> 02:08:28,360
for me today I think uh I really

2998
02:08:25,920 --> 02:08:31,359
appreciated the conversation it was very

2999
02:08:28,359 --> 02:08:33,039
natural like it was a year plus ago just

3000
02:08:31,359 --> 02:08:35,558
getting into it and having good

3001
02:08:33,039 --> 02:08:37,078
discussions and I learned things today

3002
02:08:35,559 --> 02:08:38,679
that I didn't know that were going on

3003
02:08:37,078 --> 02:08:40,880
I'm definitely going to look deeper into

3004
02:08:38,679 --> 02:08:43,599
that LA Times story Mojave about the

3005
02:08:40,880 --> 02:08:45,159
vape pens and the hardware and the the

3006
02:08:43,599 --> 02:08:49,000
[ __ ] that they're putting in those

3007
02:08:45,158 --> 02:08:52,439
that's uh that is not a good scene at

3008
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:54,039
all um Brian always a pleasure dude I

3009
02:08:52,439 --> 02:08:56,558
hope you come back with more flavors

3010
02:08:54,039 --> 02:08:59,198
we'll have another hash church here next

3011
02:08:56,559 --> 02:09:01,719
Sunday uh Mojave thank you so much for

3012
02:08:59,198 --> 02:09:04,238
your perspective and your your knowledge

3013
02:09:01,719 --> 02:09:05,760
and your stories love love the stories

3014
02:09:04,238 --> 02:09:07,519
when you and Brian were going back and

3015
02:09:05,760 --> 02:09:09,679
forth I love that old history you know

3016
02:09:07,520 --> 02:09:11,599
because it really is like you know we

3017
02:09:09,679 --> 02:09:13,920
need we we need to get Chris Bennett

3018
02:09:11,599 --> 02:09:15,719
back on the the Cannabis historian

3019
02:09:13,920 --> 02:09:17,520
because Chris has always gone further

3020
02:09:15,719 --> 02:09:20,840
back into the history but I think his

3021
02:09:17,520 --> 02:09:24,079
ability to keep history to receive these

3022
02:09:20,840 --> 02:09:28,360
stories and to put them to pen would be

3023
02:09:24,078 --> 02:09:31,599
uh a very valuable um addition to to our

3024
02:09:28,359 --> 02:09:33,639

3028
02:09:37,238 --> 02:09:40,158
between the Osprey and the hashte

3029
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:42,679

3031
02:09:42,679 --> 02:09:47,199

02:09:56,880 --> 02:10:02,039
away from one another like four

3038
02:09:59,880 --> 02:10:03,960
hours that's not too bad that's worth

3039
02:10:02,039 --> 02:10:06,519
