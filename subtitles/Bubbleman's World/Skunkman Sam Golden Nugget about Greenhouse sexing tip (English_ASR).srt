1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,759
early. So, I was going to maybe start

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,919
with Micah. Bubble Man, you got

3
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:07,439
something you want to say? Oh, I was

4
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:08,800
just going to say there's Skunk Man's

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,559
here as well if you guys want to hear a

6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,920
quick intro from him. I know a lot of

7
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:13,518
people know a lot about him, but it

8
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:16,160
might be a neat thing to hear a couple

9
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:18,000
of words from uh from the man himself.

10
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,000
Yeah, definitely. Sorry about that. I

11
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
forgot.

12
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:26,640
No problem whatsoever. Here he is now.

13
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:31,039
Howdy, howdy. Howdy, everybody in Hash

14
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:33,039
Church. Uh yeah, I I my experience with

15
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:36,160
green houses was I built my own

16
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:39,359
greenhouse about 40 years ago and then I

17
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:42,238
moved to the Netherlands where I ran

18
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:44,558
many many many professional green houses

19
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:49,038
with computerized darkening,

20
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:51,359
computerized watering and and uh I my

21
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:54,239
favorite way to grow is green houses.

22
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:54,238
Although

23
00:00:56,198 --> 00:01:02,799
there's but uh I I I I I've been there.

24
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,640
I've seen most of the changes. We were

25
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:08,959
one of the very first in the world to

26
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,719
use darkening for uh to mature cannabis

27
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:13,199
flowers in the when we were in a

28
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:16,000
northern environment in the greenhouse.

29
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,960
And uh if anybody has any questions, I'm

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'll be happy to step up to the box. But

31
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:24,959
except for that, uh, I am what I am and

32
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,118
I think pretty much everybody knows me.

33
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:29,919
True story right there. Awesome, Sam.

34
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:32,000
Thanks for sharing. We bring out and

35
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,680
maybe skunk man. Sam, I don't know. I

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,680
would be interested to hear about your

37
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,680
progression of, you know, greenhouse

38
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,680
growing and and some of your maybe your

39
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,400
life deprivation experiences. Yeah.

40
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:45,680
Where is it on? It's on. Go ahead. Yep.

41
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:47,680
Howdy. Howdy. Uh the I I've been growing

42
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:51,118
in green houses ever since the first

43
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:54,118
year I grew cannabis in Santa Cruz. That

44
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:58,319
was in uh uh maybe

45
00:01:54,118 --> 00:02:00,759
70 72 or something out like that. And uh

46
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:03,758
that was just a homemade primitive

47
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:06,640
greenhouse once. And friends of mine

48
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:09,520
were doing darkening for sexing, not for

49
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,159
flowering, but for sexing and that was

50
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,360
in Northern California. But tell tell

51
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:14,878
them what we just talked about about the

52
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,200
sexing and yeah, one of the problems

53
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:18,479
with the sexing was at that time they

54
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:20,639
didn't really understand what they were

55
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:24,159
doing. So they would darken it for two

56
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:26,559
weeks until the plant showed sex.

57
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:28,239
Whereas what the research that I found

58
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,878
when we were doing the research in

59
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:33,120
Holland was that most indica varieties

60
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:35,598
you can darken for one day and then two

61
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,159
weeks later they will show sex. They and

62
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:42,399
they will not stay.

63
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:44,639
And with with veg with uh excuse me,

64
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,959
with sativa varieties, sometimes they

65
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:49,279
need to be darkened two or three days at

66
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:53,120
the very most, but then two weeks later

67
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,800
they show the sex just and so uh it's I

68
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,680
mean I had a friend who produced

69
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,760
thousands and thousands of seedlings and

70
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:05,519
then darkened them off just for uh

71
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:09,919
sexing to sell early known female plants

72
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:11,759
to people. And uh a few times he cuz he

73
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:14,318
darkened them for 2 weeks, they would

74
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:16,878
not come back. So the customers were

75
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:19,280
rather irate that they had these little

76
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:21,039
plants that were, you know, 2 feet tall

77
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,360
and flowered off and they would not

78
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:26,799
return veg. Can you also tell the story

79
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:29,239
of how you discovered uh like greenhouse

80
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:32,719
light depth uh in in

81
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:35,360
Holl? Uh uh what happened was I went

82
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:37,039
into a crysanthemum greenhouse. I uh

83
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,799
because I was interested in building my

84
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:44,479
own greenhouse or or or buying one or

85
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:47,200
renting one or whatever. And so uh I saw

86
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:51,518
the chrosanthms were being darkened to

87
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:54,000
induce flowering and I a light went on

88
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:56,640
in my head and I went Jesus Christ. I

89
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,878
mean, I had seen people darken plants

90
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:04,639
with a tarp in the uh late 70s and early

91
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:07,518
80s, but I wasn't interested because uh

92
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:10,798
I I I wanted a greenhouse that was

93
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:12,719
multiple acres and uh you you you you

94
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,920
can't hand darken multiple acres. Well,

95
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:16,839
actually, you can if you have enough

96
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:21,199
labor, but it's uh

97
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:23,359
so once I saw what darkening could do, I

98
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:27,360
I instantly understood what this was for

99
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:29,600
cannabis. And uh so that was I don't

100
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,759
know, maybe 86 or something like that.

101
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,080
And

102
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:36,319
uh once I saw that uh yeah, I never

103
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:39,519
stepped back. uh for for the

104
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:41,599
Netherlands, you need darkening because

105
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:45,680
you you can you can grow multiple crops

106
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:50,479
a year or you can grow one big good

107
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:53,759
heavy crop and uh darken it and get it

108
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:57,120
out before the cold it comes and your

109
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:59,680
heating bills are $10,000 a day a week.

110
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,639
And can you also comment uh Sam on

111
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,079
earlier Mah was talking Micah was

112
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,079
talking and he mentioned how he kind of

113
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:07,918
likes to keep them a little bit smaller

114
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:09,599
which might be perfect for what he's

115
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:12,000
doing and and producing super high

116
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,600
quality flowers but you came in as a

117
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,279
sort of like oh I like to have really

118
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,000
big green houses and maybe just talk to

119
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:20,478
why that is. Well the main reason is is

120
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,360
I like big plants. A lot of the work I'm

121
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:26,719
doing is not commercial production. It's

122
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:29,600
breeding work. And for breeding work, I

123
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:32,840
start seeds, thousands and thousands of

124
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:36,879
seeds. And then what I do is

125
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:39,519
uh I I want to pick the best plants. And

126
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:42,399
to pick the best plant from seed, it's

127
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:44,719
very difficult to do with a a little one

128
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:46,879
or two foot plant. You grow it 12 feet

129
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,360
tall and you get a really good idea of

130
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:51,759
its positive and negative qualities,

131
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:55,120
right? And for for a breeder, it's it

132
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:57,439
it's really required. So I I that's why

133
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,280
I had a very high ceiling. My ceiling

134
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:01,519
was I don't know maybe 20 feet or so and

135
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:04,318
I could grow 15 foot tall plants if I

136
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:06,478
want get three, four or five kilos of

137
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,879
dried material.

138
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:11,038
Boom. Thanks Sam. Let me ask you Sam

139
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:12,918
about the sexing one more time. you

140
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:15,599
know, for people that are, you know,

141
00:06:12,918 --> 00:06:17,439
maybe don't have a lot of power still in

142
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,600
Humboldt or, you know, these craft

143
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:21,600
farmers, if they were to sex their

144
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,919
plants, like you were saying, how long

145
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,759
if it was, it's depending on strain, you

146
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:27,599
would say, but if somebody was to do it,

147
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:30,160
would you say to darken it for a day or

148
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,840
two instead of the two weeks like your

149
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,000
friend had done? Because I experienced

150
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:35,839
the same thing. I've seen plants that

151
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,918
didn't come back out of the veg and it

152
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:39,359
was a huge pain in the ass. So, could

153
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:41,680
you talk a little bit more about that?

154
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,000
like your recommendation.

155
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:48,400
Is my mic on? You're on. Okay. The the

156
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:52,160
main thing is that uh cannabis will take

157
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:55,439
two weeks to express its sex, but one or

158
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,840
two days of darkening is enough to trip

159
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:59,759
the expression two weeks later. That's

160
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:03,439
the main thing you have to understand.

161
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:06,400
With earlier varieties, only one day. If

162
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:08,240
it's a very late late uh equatorial

163
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:10,799
variety, maybe it takes two or three

164
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,840
days at the very most. And then when you

165
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:16,879
put them back on a long cycle, two weeks

166
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:20,159
later they sex, but they don't stay

167
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:21,519
flowering. They are totally veg and you

168
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,880
grow them really really big and then

169
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:24,639
flower them off and you know what sex

170
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:26,959
they are. That's almost like at the end

171
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:29,038
of that you should also say you're

172
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:34,399
welcome because that was a gem right

173
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:36,318
there for those dude. Dude,

174
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:38,079
absolute game changer. Thank you for

175
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,879
dropping that knowledge. Yes, I think

176
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:42,478
would help that.

177
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:44,159
You know what I mean? Like, can we can't

178
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:45,598
we quantify things with lab tests

179
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,439
sometimes? Because I know that I've

180
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:49,279
talked to a few lab companies that have

181
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:51,519
said over the course of time some of the

182
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:55,359
greenhouse material they've been testing

183
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:57,359
has has tested higher in the THC, CBD,

184
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,960
and even the tarpin percentages. And I

185
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,479
know that the tarpin companies, bubble,

186
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:01,839
man, maybe you might know something

187
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:03,598
about that.

188
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:05,519
um with greenhouse material and the

189
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:09,120
tarpine production that you might have

190
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:11,758
heard about or known.

191
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:14,319
Let me see. Am I unmuted? Yeah. Okay. Uh

192
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,319
yeah, from you know, right from Tony's

193
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,720
mouth, almost always the light depth,

194
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:22,039
the greenhouse is going to produce like

195
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:24,319
a way higher level of tarpine

196
00:08:22,038 --> 00:08:26,439
production. You know, not just a smaller

197
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,800
amount, but like a substantially larger

198
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:30,639
amount. And not to change the subject

199
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,479
completely, but while I have the mic,

200
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,799
um, one of the things Sam was mentioning

201
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:38,320
about greenhouse, um, triggering

202
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:39,799
flowering as well, um, particularly in I

203
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,719
guess it was in like,

204
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:45,519
uh, close to the equator countries where

205
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:48,240
they have 12 hours and 12 hours of light

206
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:50,959
and darkness. Um, and often people are

207
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,399
trying to grow with added light,

208
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:54,239
additional light. They'll maybe put it

209
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,839
on for another five or six hours. Sam

210
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,360
had an interesting bit of information to

211
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:02,360
share on tropical uh cannabis growing.

212
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:06,000
Basically what we found is that

213
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:09,039
uh e in the Netherlands when uh I would

214
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,159
grow big giant plants at 10 12 feet tall

215
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:16,639
over the winter uh I could give as

216
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:21,679
little as uh I was using uh these little

217
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:24,399
60 watt blue incandescent uh agriculture

218
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:26,879
balls agricultural bulbs from Phillips

219
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:29,519
and uh so they were geared towards but

220
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:31,759
but they were only 60 watts. And I would

221
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:35,679
use one of those for every 10 square

222
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:38,639
meters. So that's 100 square ft. And uh

223
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:42,000
it absolutely prevented flowering. Not

224
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:45,199
not only that, but you could use as

225
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,919
little as just in the instead of giving

226
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,560
them six or eight hours of light to keep

227
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:52,159
them veg, what you could do is just in

228
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:56,239
the middle of the night, give them two

229
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:56,240
hours of light. That's all they needed.

230
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:00,559
Yeah, I've been doing this for 30 years.

231
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,480
That's a big one for people that have

232
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:04,159
been especially in countries where, you

233
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,000
know, he was mentioning like only having

234
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:07,919
one generator, only being able to turn

235
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,759
on enough light in one section of the

236
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:11,199
greenhouse, you could do a quarter here,

237
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:12,720
a quarter there, a quarter there, and

238
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,839
instead of leaving it on for that eight

239
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:18,800
additional hours, I I I'll tell you how

240
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:21,279
severe I've done it. I actually uh was

241
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:24,240
storing plants under refrigeration at at

242
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:28,078
about plus 3 4°. So they're in a

243
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:31,519
refrigerator with lights and alls I gave

244
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:35,599
them was 15 minutes of light four times

245
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:38,078
a a day. So every 5 hours I'd give them

246
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,920
or five or six hours I give them 15

247
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:41,838
minutes of light. Totally prevented

248
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:43,838
flowering. They stayed veg. They also

249
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,440
weren't growing because it was so cold.

250
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,079
Alls I was trying to do was keep the

251
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:50,880
plants alive as a library. Did you see

252
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:54,639
that there was any reduction in actual

253
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:56,799
growth? Um, no growth practically. I

254
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:59,919
mean, under under three degrees there's

255
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:01,759
practically zero growth.

256
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:04,479
I wasn't trying to grow them. I was

257
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:06,559
trying to maintain them. Yeah. Yeah. U,

258
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,639
but my I guess my question is is, you

259
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:10,159
know, I think some people would argue,

260
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:12,399
well, they keep all these lights on

261
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:14,399
because not only do they want to uh keep

262
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,159
the photo period going, but they're also

263
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,759
trying to have the plant grow at the

264
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:20,958
same time. So, I'm just curious if you

265
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:23,919
saw any difference at any point uh in

266
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:26,399
your in your experiences where there you

267
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:29,120
could see like a a difference in growth

268
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,480
uh growth rates. The more lumens and the

269
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,240
more hours, of course, you're going to

270
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:36,720
get more growth, of

271
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:39,839
course. But that wasn't my goal. My my

272
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,440
goal was to I I had big plants in the

273
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:44,000
ground which I conserved in my

274
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,600
greenhouse. I had a small collection on

275
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,879
on eb and flow tables under under

276
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:54,879
hallides and uh just as a library and I

277
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:58,320
had a third collection in uh I had

278
00:11:54,879 --> 00:12:02,320
specially made uh like a refrigerator

279
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:05,600
with lights built into it which uh and

280
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:09,200
and those I I gave them as little as an

281
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:12,079
hour a day broken up in 15 minutes uh so

282
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:14,480
that uh they never received really long

283
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:16,159
periods of dark at any one time. It's

284
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,120
awesome information. Thanks for sharing

285
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:20,879
that.

286
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,799
Yeah, I just met a guy in Humboldt. A

287
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:25,200
lot of my research comes from old old

288
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:27,199
school growers in Humbult County and

289
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:30,240
they said the same thing Sam was saying

290
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:32,639
as far as keeping the plants in veg. Uh

291
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,560
the guy came here recently and did a

292
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,159
greenhouse tour and he goes, "No, I only

293
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:39,039
have my light on in the middle of the

294
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:40,879
night for one hour in the wintertime to

295
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:43,039
keep them in veg." And I thought, "One

296
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:45,278
hour?" And so, yeah, to save on

297
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:47,679
generator and power and all these things

298
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:50,159
that people deal with, they can't use

299
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:52,159
all this electricity or access to it

300
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:54,480
maybe in the middle of the night, you

301
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:56,799
know? So, when he told me that in the

302
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,879
veg period he that he only uses the

303
00:12:56,799 --> 00:13:00,958
light for one hour in the middle of the

304
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:02,958
night, I was just like, "Holy crap." And

305
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:04,559
now I'm starting to hear little bits and

306
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:06,799
pieces of it. And then, of course, now

307
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:09,119
Sam is kind of confirming that whole

308
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:10,879
thing, too. So, I mean, I'm going to try

309
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,120
it, you know, like I think it's pretty

310
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:14,399
cool. I want to try the sexing stuff and

311
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:18,480
play around with all those things. I

312
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:20,720
like doing experiments and and uh

313
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:24,000
another good thing to remind yourself is

314
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:27,920
is uh lots of lumens, less time, like an

315
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,200
hour, but less lumens, maybe two hours

316
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:32,240
to prevent flowering to prevent

317
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,839
flowering, you know, so keep that in

318
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:37,759
mind as your sort of recipe as you get

319
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:39,519
into it. Well, yeah, because a

320
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:40,720
Oh, sorry. So, I'm just I just want to

321
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,399
make sure I'm hearing you right. So, the

322
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,200
thought process is don't don't give them

323
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:47,120
a long period of no light. You're saying

324
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,759
just break it up and you're you're

325
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,839
turning the light on for 15 minutes

326
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:53,919
every hour. I've I've heard that and I

327
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:56,000
know Sam was saying that for his library

328
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:57,838
and part of his experimentation was to

329
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,799
keep these plants from growing but to

330
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:02,880
keep the library and so he said he dosed

331
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:05,359
them in a couple times 15 minutes at a

332
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:07,198
time if I heard you right Sam and then

333
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:10,159
at two hours and what he was just

334
00:14:07,198 --> 00:14:12,639
confirming was the two hours for a low

335
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:14,958
lumen light

336
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:17,039
right exactly if you had higher lumens

337
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:19,439
you could use maybe less time thing you

338
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:21,360
wanted to share about talking about

339
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,000
lumens

340
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:27,440
BA. Basically, what we found is that

341
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:31,240
absolutely need lots of lumens to

342
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:34,880
produce biomass in

343
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:37,440
veget or more and pretty much all it's

344
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:41,120
going to do then is uh fill out the

345
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:43,760
flowers and uh maybe uh add a lot of

346
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:46,000
weight from resin and stuff. I found

347
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:48,958
lower light levels I'm talking about

348
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,679
from the sun or from artificial lights

349
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:54,319
actually produce superior product. Also

350
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:56,799
what I found is that the high

351
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:59,760
temperatures associated with flowering

352
00:14:56,799 --> 00:15:02,159
really high temperatures it's not really

353
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:05,120
positive because it has a tendency to

354
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:07,039
vaporize tarpen right on the plant. So

355
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:12,000
lower temperatures, little bit lower

356
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:13,919
lumens I found produced superior product

357
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,519
here when we were on mute that uh well

358
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:17,198
do you want to mention it Sam? What was

359
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,879
it? I forget. It was about the size of

360
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:20,399
the resin glands versus the size of the

361
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:24,838
plant. I I just wanted to mention that

362
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:27,519
when I grew the identical clone big,

363
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:30,240
small, even in vitro, so that the

364
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:32,078
flowered off plant was only uh maybe an

365
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:35,600
inch or two tall when it was completely

366
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:38,479
flowered in ager agar in vitro in a test

367
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,800
tube. The resin is much smaller. The

368
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,759
resin individual resin heads on that

369
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:45,599
plant. when you grow it two three feet

370
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:48,639
tall like you're talking about for sea

371
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:51,199
green or something the the resin is is

372
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:54,159
uh quite a bit a bit bigger but when I

373
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:59,399
grew my same clone and it was 12 feet

374
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:59,399
tall the resin was again a little bit

375
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:05,440
that's important it's important to me we

376
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:08,559
we missed that last that last little

377
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:11,279
part but

378
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:14,799
well the the last little part was that

379
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:16,720
if your plant is 12t tall and you uh

380
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:19,359
flower it off and then you collect the

381
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:23,040
resin from that, it's again a little bit

382
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:25,278
bigger than the uh three-foot plant. The

383
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:27,360
each individual resin head is a little

384
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:30,000
bit bigger. And for hashmakers, that's

385
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,000
important.
