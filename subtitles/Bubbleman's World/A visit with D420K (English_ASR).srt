38
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,000
carburation this one's got a hole there

39
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:31,840
this one has a tiny hole right on the

well we'll give you a little bit of

44
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:49,080
Horatio Seven

45
00:02:45,318 --> 00:02:51,079
Star T City T City yeah t City you can

46
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,599
let us know how you like

47
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:56,239

48
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:58,158
boom so

49
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,158
yeah we're actually going to be heading

50
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:01,639
out for a dinner here in the near future

51
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:03,798
we're going to be hooking up with row

52
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:06,119
from high integrity glass art have a

53
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:08,799
little Easter dinner out at a nice

54
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:11,680
restaurant but before then D thought uh

55
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:13,159
you know de and I thought we would do a

56
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,480
a little video cuz we hadn't done one

57
00:03:13,158 --> 00:03:18,239
for a while puff some bowls show off the

58
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:20,719
new ball rig and then uh I guess do a

59
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,799
little bit of rosin because there's not

60
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:25,439
enough of that being done in the well

61
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:28,879
you know I uh I want to see exactly how

62
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:30,680
we're doing this properly with with some

63
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:32,959
really good

64
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,760
dry sift dry sift yeah and without

65
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,239
without me doing a few tests on it

66
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:40,039
because I'm really I'm really partial

67
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:42,120
about wasting any bit of my dry sift if

68
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:44,479
I'm not knowing the tech proper

69
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,158
technique and makes sense I I I put too

70
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:48,919
much time into it I think it's why we'll

71
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:50,798
do very you know I mean it always looks

72
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:53,158
great to do a big ball and get a good

73
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:55,360
amount but we'll do smaller amounts and

74
00:03:53,158 --> 00:03:57,719
we'll just do exactly cuz it's just too

75
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,680
valuable of a product so yeah I got the

76
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:02,438
fresh hes uh rosin screen the uh

77
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,920
pressing screen blotting screen whatever

78
00:04:02,438 --> 00:04:07,438
you want to call it 25 micron it's a

79
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:10,119
nice new clean screen so we'll probably

80
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:12,120
just go right into the corner

81
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:16,040
here create a

82
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:19,079
little a little dish and then uh I guess

83
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:22,319
we'll get a little a little rock of this

84
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:25,319
dry set absolutely man give her don't be

85
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:25,319
shy

86
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:37,120
clean for

87
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,120
me all right so let's see what we got

88
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:48,038
here all right it's not too much by any

89
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:51,240
means yeah nice little piece twist it up

90
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:54,639
real tight in the 25 micron we'll turn

91
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:56,840
on our little hair straightener

92
00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:00,240
here and then we're going to use the uh

93
00:04:56,839 --> 00:05:00,239
dabbing screen

94
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:07,279
yep it clean had just a little bit of

95
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:08,879
rosin left over on it from before and

96
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:10,439
basically fold that over the same way

97
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:12,639
you would with

98
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:15,199
parchment like along that lines right

99
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:18,160
there yeah and

100
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:20,478
then now with the parchment paper or

101
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,680
with the slick sheet the oil slick sheet

102
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:25,639
that's a slick sheet that's the Teflon

103
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:27,519
Pap uh sheet stuff with both of those

104
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:30,439
you have to be more careful because the

105
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:32,680
heat is so much closer to direct

106
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:34,918
this thing is so thick and it absorbs up

107
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:37,680
a bunch of the heat you actually have to

108
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:40,120
give it a press for longer like if I do

109
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:43,199
a 5-second press with parchment paper

110
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:47,199
I'll easily do a 10 or a 15c press or

111
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:49,400
two 7 Minute presses uh with this with

112
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,400
this

113
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:55,560
amount see some gooiness out of there

114
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:55,560
already oh it's

115
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,639
coming it's just right off the bat

116
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,759
holy that's that's that's

117
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:10,639
beautiful

118
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:12,479
right wow check it out so that uh we

119
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,918
could probably and we will probably

120
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:17,360
press that out at least one more time

121
00:06:14,918 --> 00:06:20,519
and get another a chunk of it but yeah

122
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,680
take your Dabber and uh pick some of

123
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:22,680
that

124
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:34,360

lots there I know take a I can't wait to

132
00:06:55,478 --> 00:07:02,839
see what D thinks of his full melt OG

133
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:06,039
cook dryft yeah full melt OG cush 99%

134
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:07,758
ratio heads squeezed with a hair

135
00:07:06,038 --> 00:07:11,759
straightener

136
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:14,240
into an eight star full

137
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:18,439
melt now what I'm mostly interested in

138
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:20,960
seeing is if he gets the Head Rush that

139
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:24,079
I first got the first few times I smoked

140
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:27,159
rosin made with really nice sift or hash

141
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:31,478
it was a different kind of a rip that I

142
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:35,479
got from just you know normal a normal

143
00:07:31,478 --> 00:07:37,399
same size rip of hash just was

144
00:07:35,478 --> 00:07:39,800
different we'll see what he has to say

145
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:39,799
here in a

146
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,759
second boom boom

147
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:52,400
boom

148
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:57,159
wow flavorful got to photograph it dude

149
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:57,158
very flavorful right like

150
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:04,719
uh feel kind of kind of like really good

151
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:08,560
honey oil from what I used to remember

152
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:10,280
right but uh but

153
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:14,079
not

154
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:16,439
interesting not like a cleaner it

155
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:18,318
doesn't have that harsh piece right here

156
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:19,959
where you you remember smoking over you

157
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,598
know this hash real well though don't

158
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:25,598
you yes exactly yeah but but it gave me

159
00:08:22,598 --> 00:08:27,439
a a total like I made oil out of it

160
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:31,158
honey oil out of it or shatter or

161
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:34,759
something like that you just did did and

162
00:08:31,158 --> 00:08:37,679
uh you literally just did good flavor

163
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:39,918
and a good Buzz interesting isn't it

164
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:41,158
yeah it it creeps up on you it just

165
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:43,559
started

166
00:08:41,158 --> 00:08:45,559

168
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:49,000
photographing rosin all

169
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:57,959

177
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:19,199
hit that one like that whole the rest of

178
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,959
it I think you should those things I'm

179
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,278
used to hearing fall over those little

180
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:25,759
quartz pieces yeah and I don't even

181
00:09:24,278 --> 00:09:27,200
worry about them so much like on the

182
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:29,838
base of my Mothership and stuff the

183
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,680
titanium ones I worry about when someone

184
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:34,000
puts a titanium one on my bowl and then

185
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:36,639
leaves it I worry about it just going

186
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,440
like this it's such a hard thing yeah

187
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:40,278
that if it touches this you know for

188
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:42,040
sure it's going to oh yeah you don't

189
00:09:40,278 --> 00:09:43,600
want that no you really don't that's why

190
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:45,919
I use the quartz more often than not

191
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,680
this one was the Super nerve racker cuz

192
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:49,278
it gets hot so if you're holding it on

193
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:52,919
there for a long point of time it gets

194
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:55,519
hot and it's just pure

195
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:58,319
titanium so I guess I better take this

196
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:01,120
rip you just got yours it was nice and

197

clothes that was really really really

209
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:10,958
nice rosin with high-grade dry sift and

210
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:14,039
bubble hash who would have thought it we

211
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:15,000
would have thought it and indeed did

212

are we going to do another squeeze on

219
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:31,919
that we can

220
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:38,720

249
00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:00,000

250
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:03,078
bad whatsoever just to give you guys oh

251
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,799
the show don't want to skip the audience

252
00:13:03,078 --> 00:13:07,278
they're all wondering what is it they're

253
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:08,958
looking at over there just a little Ros

254
00:13:07,278 --> 00:13:11,399
and

255
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:12,518
smile I'll show you guys the photos as

256
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:15,519
well of

257
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:18,039
course and uh yeah there it is man dry

258
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:20,560
SI turned into Ros and not too shabby

259
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:21,439
you got to admit something different

260
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:24,399
very

261
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,680
potent yeah you know for the hit one

262
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:28,679
thing I noticed too is how long it lasts

263
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:32,159
when I take a rip of the rosin compared

264
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:35,239
to a rip of the bubs of the dry sift

265
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:38,278
it's very long lasting it's um it's a

266
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:40,919
treat absolute treat it's so much a

267
00:13:38,278 --> 00:13:43,039
treat I don't want to hit it again I

268
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:45,439
think you should going I'm going to hit

269
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:48,240
it in my honey bucket do

270
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,600
it honey bucket it

271
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:53,399
upst I saw the kid Nathan or whatever

272
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:54,920
his name was he posted it on for sale

273
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:57,799
2600

274
00:13:54,919 --> 00:14:00,078
yeah and uh they they said they have a

275
00:13:57,799 --> 00:14:02,879
timer on there

276
00:14:00,078 --> 00:14:05,359
on on their quartz yeah but it depends

277
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:08,120
on what you're hitting you know longer

278
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:10,519
leave I I would leave it longer for this

279
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:12,320
type of product which is an oil but like

280
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:15,799
say if you were hitting dry s for full

281
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:19,959
melt I would hit it within 10 seconds 30

282
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:23,078
to 45 seconds um if it's an oil like a

283
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:25,758
rosin but really within 10 seconds I'll

284
00:14:23,078 --> 00:14:28,039
drop it on there if it's full melt or

285
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:30,959
dry sift or wet

286
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:33,958
wash how was

287
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:33,958
that

288
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:43,199
Holy that's awesome isn't

289
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:46,120
it yeah dude super stoked on this whole

290
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:49,599
process coming out and being popularized

291
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:53,440
a way to make shitty hash uh great Hash

292
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:55,120
a way for me to access a dab out of Bud

293
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,759
almost the whole thing yeah I just

294
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,679
wanted to photograph that last little

295
00:14:56,759 --> 00:15:02,039
bit

296
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:02,039
it's

297
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:08,120
good

298
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:12,039
sweet I love

299
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:14,440
it man got to love the oil slick pad for

300
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:16,319
for doing the the rosin technique on I

301
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:18,440
don't think I'll use parchment or Teflon

302
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:21,079
sheet again to be honest it's just comes

303
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:23,279
off the easiest I've seen from the oil

304
00:15:21,078 --> 00:15:25,838
slick pad and I like the way it

305
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:28,120
insulates the Heat and allows me to

306
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:29,560
really press with more pressure and more

307
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:32,000
heat than I would nor normally be able

308
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:37,198
to do with just parchment or the uh

309
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:39,278
slick sheet yep yeah very good well I

310
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:42,519
think uh that's it for now we're going
