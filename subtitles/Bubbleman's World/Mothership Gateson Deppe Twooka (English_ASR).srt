hey how's it going everybody Welcome to

3
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:25,919
Bubble man's world kind of in the dark

4
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,278
here kind of I got to lean back so you

5
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,840
guys can see my face or I guess I could

6
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:30,960
always turn my head around backwards we

7
00:00:28,839 --> 00:00:32,878
could do it this way so I am over here

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,558
at high integrity glass

9
00:00:32,878 --> 00:00:40,280
art for those of you that aren't

10
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:42,919
familiar um and as always he's got some

11
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:44,879
epic piece of glass out for me to enjoy

12
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:48,079
I did do a video of this a very short

13
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:50,039
video 35 or 38 seconds I believe it was

14
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:54,480
and this is of course the mothership

15
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:57,039
Gates and deppy Tuka so it's got the two

16
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:59,358
spots right here um originally designed

17
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,760
it was going to have hoses uh Row from

18
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,079
high integrity glass art requested some

19
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:06,079
customization and got these mouthpieces

20
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:07,679
done so uh I'll show those up to the

21
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:09,798
camera later so you guys can see the

22
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,560
quality in that so you can have the two

23
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:14,520
rips at once and I've got some West

24
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,000
Coast concentrate here that I'm going to

25
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:20,199
dip into something new I was going to

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,799
try the three times crazy uh just

27
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,719
getting up actually not even up on the

28
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,159
website although by the time I edit this

29
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:30,840
video and share this video it could

30
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:33,399
potentially be up by then so super cushy

31
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:37,079
overtones very strong almost like a c

32
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:40,399
Like A og of sorts and so we'll just do

33
00:01:37,078 --> 00:01:41,879
a little uh just do a little rosin dab

34
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:46,280
with a Turk

35
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:47,798
dip three times crazy out of the Tuka

36
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,118

00:01:50,118 --> 00:01:53,759
this little Universe marble that gateson

39
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:56,000
is of course very well known with with a

40
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,519
star explosion and a little red ruby

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,599
mars-like planet floating at the top As

42
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:03,759
you move yourself around you see this

43
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:06,280
variety of planets and galaxies showing

44
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,679
up it's just nothing shy of Epic between

45
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,759
deppy and gateson the base is covered in

46
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:14,280
a collage of marbles done by the two

47
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:16,479
artists to nothing short of perfection

48
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,959
and uh got a little drop down in here

49
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:20,840
with a denail this is of course the

50
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:23,920

this five or six seed perk that goes up

60
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:07,639
through the

61
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:10,959
center almost like a Taurus such a great

62
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:14,199
