bit but it's 230 we've got the ceramic

8
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,160
insert cleaned very nicely we found out

9
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:41,679
that the torch definitely does clean the

10
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:43,359
ceramic better than trying to scrape it

11
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:48,558
with a skillet

12
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:52,000

33
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,920
going to hit the Barb 45 the Barb nice

34
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:10,878
difference in the colors I just want to

35
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:12,839
show them real quick the Barb you can

36
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:16,639
tell that there's a difference in tpin

37
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:18,120
right there one is almost a reddish

38
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:20,479
color this one here this one has much

39
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,599
more of a blonde color to it and this is

40
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:24,518
the 45 the reddish darker one and the

41
00:02:22,598 --> 00:02:27,719
more I wouldn't say reddish but almost

42
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:33,239
the orangish tinge to it compared to the

43
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:33,239
the more blonde for sure there you

44
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:39,878
go pretty stoked on this little ceramic

45
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:41,759
insert that Dil sent me um now that

46
00:02:39,878 --> 00:02:45,639
we've actually figured out torching it

47
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:48,000
and getting it um getting it properly

48
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:50,279
cleaned it's it's a pretty pretty neat

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,878
little unit just paint the the the Melt

50
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:55,199
right onto it and it

51
00:02:51,878 --> 00:02:57,318
just bubbles quite

52
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:59,799
lovely nice save

53
00:02:57,318 --> 00:03:01,000
though it's not as Tippy as you think

54
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,840
think

55
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,919
hey m i find just a right angle you hit

56
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,439
it on the side it find when I touch it I

57
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:10,399
I'm more inclined to touch it in the

58
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:12,479
middle almost then on the edge on the

59
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,879
edge it tends to do its little I'm sure

60
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:16,000
the guys will figure it out this was

61
00:03:13,878 --> 00:03:18,798
originally designed to insert into the

62
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,759
titanium nail my titanium nail that I

63
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:22,879
have was a special nail that they ground

64
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:25,479
down and the walls were a little thicker

65
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:27,639
so it didn't fit into it so I figured if

66
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:29,199
it sits on the tie nail like that it

67
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:31,199
could sit on the quartz nail like that

68
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:32,679
so they were surprised they had no

69
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:36,039
intentions of using it with a quartz

70
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:38,879
nail but uh I'll tell you I have every

71
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:42,318
intention of using it with a quartz

72
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:42,318
nail anybody

73
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:49,158
else off

74
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:50,919
camera I'll do one more on camera which

75
00:03:49,158 --> 00:03:53,078
one you going to hit I think I'm going

76
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:56,878
to hit this Barbara

77
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:57,760
120 the light the light have you seen

78
00:03:56,878 --> 00:03:59,840
the

79
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:02,959
light all right let's see if we can just

80
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,280
paint that on there you're losing it I

81
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,319
lost it I better heat it up

82
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,598
first sometimes it's best to heat the

83
00:04:07,318 --> 00:04:13,359
Dabber up just a tiny little bit on the

84
00:04:10,598 --> 00:04:15,238
nail or on the

85
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,400
ceramic you can

86
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:22,319
literally pick up a nice big

87
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:22,319
rock and paint that on

88
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,600
there

89
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:41,319
bring around the

90
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,319

ceramic that was delicious we're going

93
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:54,319
to continue to do much of this and we'll

94
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,680
get back to some hash making uh probably

95
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:58,319
in the near

96
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:01,120
future more importantly some uh some

97
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:03,560
interviews with uh great gardener about

98
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,639
