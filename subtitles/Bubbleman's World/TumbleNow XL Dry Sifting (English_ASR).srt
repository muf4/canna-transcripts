11
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:49,919
actually you know what I'm excited a dry

12
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,719
sifter of your stature I would expect so

13
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,079
um I love dry sift so much for my

14
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:56,120
medicine so absolutely I'm sorry I open

15
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,640
this up that's okay yeah of course crack

16
00:00:56,119 --> 00:01:00,518
it open check it out we got the

17
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:03,239
stainless steel mesh happening in here

18
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:04,959
pull that out pretty easy too yeah

19
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:06,158
absolutely wanted to do something a

20
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,959
little bit different you know all these

21
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,159
plastic models on the market today I

22
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:13,239
thought uh originally what I also wanted

23
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:15,280
to do was um add cold packs but I

24
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:16,640
thought you know this is metal so people

25
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,320
could throw this in the in the deep

26
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,478
freezer and get it all cold before they

27
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:22,758
fill it up for a little uh for a little

28
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:24,118
dry sifting and then of course one of

29
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:26,319
the things you'll really like about this

30
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:28,959
unit I'm looking right here the screen

31
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:30,478
here our secondary screen 70 micr which

32
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:31,798
is my favorite

33
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:35,319
screen what did you actually make this

34
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:37,479
for me 200 lines per inch 70 Micron and

35
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:39,438
uh good for cleaning up the resin that

36
00:01:37,478 --> 00:01:42,039
you've once already extracted instead of

37
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:44,000
falling onto a catch tray we've got a

38
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:46,159
secondary screen that will allow us to

39
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,718
clean out the contaminants that we've

40
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,159
depending on how rough you've extracted

41
00:01:48,718 --> 00:01:51,679
if you tumbled for a minute you'll have

42
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,118
a lot less cleaning if you tumbled for

43
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,079
10 or 15 minutes you're going to have a

44
00:01:54,118 --> 00:02:00,399
lot more cleaning to do

45
00:01:57,078 --> 00:02:02,438
so I gu great

46
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,640
yeah we're pretty excited about this uh

47
00:02:02,438 --> 00:02:08,439
this bigger unit too I'm suspecting I'll

48
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:11,000
be able to get at least a pound and a

49
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:13,159
half worth of material into this unit

50
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,878
here as the other unit is uh much

51
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:18,159
smaller that way well my um I have a

52
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:19,759
friend of M that actually they gave me

53
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:21,719
some material that she needed cleaning

54
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:23,359
she's uh by that mess and she wants to

55
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:25,519
just use the tripo heads and do some

56
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:30,200
education with it okay and and I

57
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:31,759
mentioned it to you and her and dude I

58
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:34,079
actually brought something for you to do

59
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:36,759
that with all right well why don't we uh

60
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,319
let John go find what he found for us to

61
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:39,959
do and we're going to maybe make some

62
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:42,000
medicine for someone today that's

63
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:44,360
awesome yeah sweet just give me a minute

64
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,800
I'll be back in a minute man hell

65
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:50,519
yeah so uh just to show you the smaller

66
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:53,200
tumble now I have over here just out of

67
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:55,400
camera this is the original unit right

68
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:57,759
here you can see the different size

69
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:01,120
difference quite a bit of a smaller can

70
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:03,039
on the inside smaller tray

71
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,759
um this one I've already used you can

72
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:06,719
see that there's not much left on top of

73
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:08,560
the screen but I have quite a bit of

74
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:10,479
catch what I call catch and this is

75
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,280
mostly uh you know not to say that

76
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:14,919
there's no actives left in there but

77
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,000
there's definitely a lot fewer than when

78
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:21,359
I began uh anything smaller than a 70

79
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,439
Micron screen will be uh will be pushed

80
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,760
through to there so there is some uh

81
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:30,639
some actives just not a terrible

82
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:32,120
amount sweet we'll take this one down

83
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:33,559
yeah that's the original unit the

84
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,878
smaller unit more and more people have

85
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:38,039
been asking me for a bigger unit so well

86
00:03:35,878 --> 00:03:40,359
this is this is what uh what you gave me

87
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:42,359
it's in the freezer so excellent yeah

88
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:44,439
it's nice and cold nice and

89
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:47,439
cold all

90
00:03:44,438 --> 00:03:49,000
right beautiful all right one thing I

91
00:03:47,438 --> 00:03:50,719
don't suggest is doing what we're doing

92
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,878
right now and having your unit sit in

93
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:56,359
the sun just from having this lid open

94
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:58,158
the unit lid is extremely warm so before

95
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:01,720
we start this mix what I'm going to do

96
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:01,719
is just take this guy out

97
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,759
go pop them in the freezer for a quick

98
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:09,359
minute and you can maybe uh tell them a

99
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:11,679
little bit about

100
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,840
that I am too also going to take this

101
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,519
out of the sun I mean uh that's why

102
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,879
we're doing this so uh this looks like

103
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:20,319
some really fine medicine here it's uh

104
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:23,120
just a popcorn and the trim that uh

105
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:26,319
she's actually kept for herself and

106
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,639
she's uh asked me to clean it for her

107
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:30,360
because uh with her condition she's

108
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,160
realized that just using the the triones

109
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:35,800
work very well for her condition because

110
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,600
she she has she has Ms and um now she's

111
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,079
able to medicate and still be able to do

112
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,879
her job which she works in a

113
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:43,279
professional field so for her just

114
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:45,478
taking a little bit of Mount um of just

115
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:48,959
medicine clean like what I do myself um

116
00:04:45,478 --> 00:04:51,038
works very well for her so uh just just

117
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:53,319
some good old

118
00:04:51,038 --> 00:04:55,319
uh we take a better look at that I can

119
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:57,478
show you that so it's pretty good

120
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:59,918
material but it's it's not the worst so

121
00:04:57,478 --> 00:05:01,240
gives you an idea all right nice you got

122
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:03,719
that one coming out of the

123
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,960
freezer yeah so why don't we uh I was

124
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,880
just showing them all that Crystal you

125
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:09,478
can even see a gling in their ey very

126
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:13,918
nice yeah glisteny glisteny so maybe we

127
00:05:09,478 --> 00:05:13,918
should fill this up I'm just going to do

128
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:20,719
this that's one yeah we might as well

129
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,720
throw a secondary one in there see have

130
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,960
uh I have a second one look at that same

131
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,960
same

132
00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:30,918
[Applause]

133
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:32,918
material all right

134
00:05:30,918 --> 00:05:35,159
maybe do a third or you good yeah we'll

135
00:05:32,918 --> 00:05:37,198
start with this TR try a single one on

136
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,680
the small one maybe yeah yeah exactly so

137
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,240
we'll put this down this is magnetic

138
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,400
seals nice and

139
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:47,600
tight get this guy in

140
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:50,038
here basically sits in pretty easy

141
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,479
anybody can do this yeah put the square

142
00:05:50,038 --> 00:05:53,918
in

143
00:05:51,478 --> 00:05:56,120
first this drops into the other

144
00:05:53,918 --> 00:06:01,439
component so that just dropped in there

145
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:04,759
perfectly just plugged in and

146
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:08,000
she starts spinning not a terribly fast

147
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:12,639
spin but you can kind of see the resin

148
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,519
clouds yeah can you see those yeah nice

149
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,038
can smell it too smell that right away

150
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:17,719
yeah AB I start turning that actually

151
00:06:16,038 --> 00:06:20,478
started really smelling I'll keep the

152
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,080
lid closed just because um I don't that

153
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:23,478
once again that sun is really hot and I

154
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:25,719
don't want the metal to heat up in

155
00:06:23,478 --> 00:06:28,519
anyway I would urge you to do this in a

156
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:31,240
cold place if you can a walk-in freezer

157
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:33,918
a basement a seller something colder

158
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:38,400
than your average room in your

159
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:40,159
house yeah you can tumble for as long as

160
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:44,239
you want I personally really like to

161
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:46,520
Tumble for 15 to 30 seconds call it a

162
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,918
day and then see what I got and see how

163
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:52,159
long it's going to take me to clean it

164
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:54,560
with my microscope so open up the screen

165
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,680
you can definitely see a nice glaze of

166
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,918
heads if you oh look at that oh yeah

167
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:01,439
those are glycerin too yeah that's uh

168
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:04,959
that's pretty exactly the side of the

169
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:08,439
tum and stuff oh yeah there's that's

170
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:11,038
diamondy so oh she's going to be excited

171
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:13,879
absolutely we'll uh get some photographs

172
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:13,878
with the macro

173
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:20,839
camera and we're going to do some more

174
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,160
tumbling but out of the camera and we'll

175
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:24,198
be right back John and I are going to

176
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,759
sit and talk for a while we'll be back

177
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:27,919
in just a little

178
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,889
bit all right so just doing a little bit

179
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:31,318
more tumbling here

180
00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:33,439
[Music]

181
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:37,879
do a quick

182
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:37,879
check what we got happening on the

183
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:50,158
screen decent little

184
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,639
amount was after a couple more

185
00:07:50,158 --> 00:07:56,158
minutes so this particular material I

186
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:59,519
wouldn't say is drenched in mature heads

187
00:07:56,158 --> 00:08:02,399
but still is um going to make some nice

188
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:02,399
medicine for someone in

189
00:08:02,918 --> 00:08:07,000
need one more pile to work

190
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:14,319
with so from the little bit that we got

191
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:18,199
just from our 15 to

192
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:20,560
202 tumble that we did I've now kind of

193
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:23,919
collected it all into the middle

194
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:26,959
photographed it it's it's it's your

195
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:31,038
average Farmer's grade you know probably

196
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:33,278
maybe 50 to 60% contaminant maybe maybe

197
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:35,158
a little bit more I've seen it as high

198
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:39,360
as 90 so I don't consider that to be

199
00:08:35,158 --> 00:08:42,080
extremely high but now I just kind of

200
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,959
gently cart it over the

201
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:47,040
screen get those contaminants pushed

202
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:50,079
through it's a nice big screen so you

203
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:53,079
can work with as much of it as you

204
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,839
want contaminant will go through faster

205
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,440
you see little hairs or fibers it's

206
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:59,560
never a bad idea to just get them out

207
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:01,200
with your hand

208
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:03,838
and so I'll generally just do this for a

209
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,200
little while until I see the the dry

210
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:09,320
sift reacting the way I want it to

211
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:12,040
clinging together a little more and and

212
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:13,640
it'll also be a little like it's what I

213
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:16,439
would call fluffy right now and

214
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:19,319
eventually as you clean it it becomes

215
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:21,200
you know more more lumpy so that's kind

216
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:23,200
of what I'm looking for not to say that

217
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,720
you know smoking this wouldn't be a real

218
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,160
nice experience but it's still you know

219
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:30,600
massive contaminant and the whole

220
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:33,240
purpose of the secondary is so you can

221
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,680
clean up what you extract so we're just

222
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:38,480
going to clean a little bit of this up

223
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:39,759
get it to about 90% glandular heads and

224
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,720
uh then John and I are each going to

225
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:43,360
have a nice rip and then we'll do a

226
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:48,440
little bit more tumbling

227
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,440
and we'll talk more with John about dry

228
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:56,278
sifting so I've just been carding it for

229
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,200
a little bit here can't really tell that

230
00:09:56,278 --> 00:10:00,000
much has gone through unless you open up

231
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:04,519
the top scream and screen and then you

232
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,720
see the black plate it's uh it's a fair

233
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:09,480
bit

234
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:12,879
of of stuff that's gone through

235
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:14,399
there very talcum powdery still going to

236
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:16,519
be some heads all the heads that are

237
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,759
smaller than 70 Micron will end up under

238
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:20,480
there

239
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:22,759
but nothing above 70 Micron is going to

240
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,120
go through this screen so we should

241
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:28,078
manage to once we get the rest of the

242
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:31,039
contaminant out and I've only been doing

243
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:33,879
this for maybe 5 minutes so 5 minutes I

244
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:37,120
managed to push I'd say at least 25 to

245
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:40,240
30% of the weight right through we were

246
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:44,440
guessing it was at least 60% contaminant

247
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:46,240
so I've increased it its quality just by

248
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:48,040
reducing the

249
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,440
impurities and we're just going to keep

250
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:50,719
at it for another 5 or 10 minutes and

251
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,519
we'll come back and have a nice melty

252
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,519
bong rip with you

253
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:58,439
guys move no no you're good you just hit

254
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:01,528
all like

[Music]

257
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,879
almost all the heads you got over here

258
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:25,959
look at this so just

259
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:28,639
gently sort of running this resin over

260
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:32,599
the screen now by all means this is not

261
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:34,399
like the only way to to do this and I

262
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,639
urge you all to come up with new ways

263
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:39,440
and play around and have

264
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:41,919
fun but it is one guaranteed way of

265
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:45,760
getting yourself down up to 90 you know

266
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:48,639
90 and even upwards of 98 99% pure gland

267
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:51,360
heads by just slowly reducing and

268
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:52,839
removing the impurities that are trapped

269
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,639
in the extraction because of course

270
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:56,720
everything's falling without with the

271
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:59,919
help of gravity no no water keeping

272
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,200
things aoat like in bubble has

273
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:02,439
so we kind of got to do this slow

274
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,920
process but I'll tell you when you take

275
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:09,959
a hit of this no yeah no chemicals no

276
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:13,519
footprint not even lost tur it's all

277
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:16,958
right there in the

SI clean the tastiest and the best

279
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:22,838
medicine yeah everyone loves it I kind

280
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,839
of call it the Holy Grail

281
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:35,319
hit see how fast pressed up there just

282
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:38,159
off the end of the

283
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:42,399
card some nice

284
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:42,399
stuff like everything takes time to

285
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:48,319
get to AI this yeah it's starting to

286
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:51,159
look a lot pure it's funny the purer it

287
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:54,560
gets the easier it is to see the

288
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:56,319
contaminants and so when I really start

289
00:12:54,559 --> 00:13:00,278
to the naked eye it looks real clean and

290
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:03,680
then as I get it cleaner it looks

291
00:13:00,278 --> 00:13:03,679
dir strange

292
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:09,159

here soon and see uh See if we've

298
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:30,078
cleaned up a noticeable amount of

299
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:32,799
contaminant all right we've uh tumbled

300
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:33,838
up a little bit of uh dry SI we've done

301
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:36,039
a little bit of

302
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:37,519
cleaning and uh now we're just kind of

303
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:40,039
at the point where we felt like should

304
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,039
be doing some

it's someone else's medicine but John

309
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:03,720
has some really nice dry that I've been

310
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:05,440
holding hostage in my pocket here and I

311

have a nice little rock of full melt
