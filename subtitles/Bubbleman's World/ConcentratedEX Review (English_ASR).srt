00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:25,118
hey guys welcome to Bubble man's world

3
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:28,039
and today I'm going to be reviewing a

4
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:30,079
really really great guys product uh you

5
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:31,719
probably know him from Instagram if you

6
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:35,359
checked them out at

7
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:39,239
concentrated X so that's the word

8
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:41,000
concentrated with an ex ex at the end um

9
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:44,479
I've got a wonderful variety of products

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,079
from him the guy is super on point for

11
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:50,479
his ability to choose and find uh

12
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,600
cultivars that have absolutely beautiful

13
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:56,119
expressions of their tpine profiles and

14
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:58,239
their cannabinoid profiles uh he's been

15
00:00:56,119 --> 00:01:00,079
uh sending me stuff for a little while

16
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:02,119
here and he's got himself into some

17
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,519
really nice DNA genetics he's got a

18
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:08,359
beautiful cut of strawberry banana and

19
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:11,240
so he has sent me a little 120 Micron

20
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:14,159
bubble hash uh from the strawberry

21
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:17,839
banana he has sent me a little bit of

22
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:20,200
the golden Berry uh this is 120 microns

23
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:23,520
as well and then we have three different

24
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:26,118
rosins so we have the cookies and cream

25
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:28,199
dry sift rosin with kosher kush dry sift

26
00:01:26,118 --> 00:01:30,319
rosin this is head stash he's written on

27
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,478
the thing and he gave me another one

28
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:34,398
cookies and cream Kos cush dry sift

29
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:36,359
rosin head stash and those are both

30
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:39,159
rosins and then of course here's a

31
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:41,239
bubble has uh strawberry banana rosins

32
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:43,759
so these strawberry bananas just have

33
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:46,640
the most incredible flavor profile on

34
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,959
them when you pull them out people their

35
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,280
eyebrows go up if you exhale a hit of

36
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:54,078
this people are around you asking what

37
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:57,159
is that so great job on that and then of

38
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:59,599
course he actually sent me some bud as

39
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:01,600
well so I've got some cookies and cream

40
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:04,078
here on the case this is from uh the

41
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:05,718
cultivars came from exotic genetics

42
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:08,359
right off the bat I apologize for the

43
00:02:05,718 --> 00:02:10,719
darkness today um I wanted to get myself

44
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:12,680
lit up as beautiful as possible but for

45
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:14,598
whatever reason today I'm just not

46
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:16,400
having it I've got the back light on me

47
00:02:14,598 --> 00:02:18,399
I hope you guys prefer the view over a

48
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,480
bright bubble man but uh I don't think

49
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,280
it'll stop us from doing a really nice

50
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:25,199
uh review video on these products and of

51
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:27,280
course I'm going to photograph up close

52
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:29,318
macro each one of these products so you

53
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,479
can actually see what it looks like uh

54
00:02:29,318 --> 00:02:32,199
close up

55
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:35,598
we've got ourselves a little bit High

56
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:37,159
here going I think we're good get myself

57
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:41,878
up to about

58
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:43,519
5.95 boom there we go and what to start

59
00:02:41,878 --> 00:02:48,000
with what to start with

60
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:49,319
well ah I say we start with the bud cuz

61
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,759
that's what everyone starts with I've

62
00:02:49,318 --> 00:02:52,598
got a nice little vaporizer I'm going to

63
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:55,280
grab and I'll be back all right so the

64
00:02:52,598 --> 00:02:57,560
vaporizer I grabbed is of course the

65
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:01,400
grasshopper um this came from Vape fiend

66
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:03,840
in London and uh yeah let's get this

67
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,080
happening little bit of an empty bowl to

68
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,360
be cleaned

69
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:10,120
out which is never a big deal with the

70
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:13,680
grasshopper it comes out so

71
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,680
easy get it all

72
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:20,158
out there we

73
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:24,238
go give that last little

74
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:26,798
blow make sure everything's cleared out

75
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:29,400
nicely just cuz you want that nice taste

76
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,400
in your rip and this is particularly

77
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,879
lovely

78
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:36,280
herb so we want to make sure that we

79
00:03:33,878 --> 00:03:39,039
maximize it and don't have

80
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:40,120
any leftover remnants in here so for

81
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:41,840
those of you that don't know about the

82
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:45,158
Grasshopper Vaporizer this is a great

83
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:47,080
little unit really clean really easy

84
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:49,519
fits in the pocket does not look like a

85
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,480
vaporizer like most of these pen units

86
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,039
um it really looks like a pen as you can

87
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:54,399
see a little bit dark as I've mentioned

88
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:56,280
before but you can still see this is a

89
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,599
great little unit great little

90
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,039
grasshopper unit and uh we're going to

91
00:03:58,598 --> 00:04:03,719
put a little butt in there we're going

92
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:05,199
to start with the concentrated X review

93
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:06,759
and really all you have to do is hear me

94
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:10,039
in a review you don't really have to see

95
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:12,840
everything what uh you will see is very

96
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:15,000
clear very bright macro photographs of

97
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,519
these materials as you can see right now

98
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,040
here's the bud that I'm about to pull

99
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:22,959
out beautiful kaix formation on this

100
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:25,720
product and uh as always just grown to

101
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:30,758
DAR near Perfection and we just stuff it

102
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:33,280
into the uh into the the vaporizer here

103
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:36,120
I don't usually hit herb this way I will

104
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:37,918
admit I'm more of a a concentrate guy I

105
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:41,000
would probably take this herb and squish

106
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:42,359
it in the sasquash Press uh but I

107
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,120
thought for the review that it would be

108
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,919
cool if I started

109
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:48,360
uh with a little Vape hit out of this

110
00:04:46,918 --> 00:04:49,719
particular cookies and cream this isn't

111
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,520
the first time I've hit the cookies and

112
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:54,000
cream of course exotic genetics gifted

113
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:57,560
me some uh

114
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,399
99.9% uh dry sift from Cuban uh year and

115
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,160
a half ago or so when we were in Jamaica

116
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:02,758
and that was really nice I took some

117
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,720
pretty epic photos of it if you don't

118
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:07,680
remember uh you can check them out on my

119
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,400
Instagram as well as Cuban's Instagram

120
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,478
and so this unit is real simple you push

121
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:13,478
the button once you get a line of red

122
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:16,439
lights in the bottom there's like 10

123
00:05:13,478 --> 00:05:18,360
little dots and within about 3 to 5

124
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:20,478
Seconds you'll see that it will reach

125
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:23,038
temperature those dots will turn blue as

126
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:28,120
it just turned and then I usually give

127
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:28,120
it a little bit of time and gently pull

128
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,399
wow really really nice flavor on that

129
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:40,519
Cookies and Cream came in really nice

130
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:42,599
and light and vaporized um good cont uh

131
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:44,159
moisture content on this Bud by no means

132
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,800
does it break into powder when you break

133
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,160
it it actually squishes and it's more

134
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:50,400
marshmallowy so that's always nice we've

135
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,600
got this on maximum all right let's give

136
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:52,599
it a

137
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:58,960
shot all right here we go

138
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,720
really nice flavor profile on both of

139
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,720
those

140
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,680
rips not sure if you guys are catching

141
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:22,598
it it's a fairly light Vapor um I'm sure

142
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,519
if you stuffed it more and turned up the

143
00:06:22,598 --> 00:06:27,159
temperature you could get a a bigger Rip

144
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:29,079
but you know for me for vaporizers the

145
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:31,439
rip that I want I'm going to get out of

146
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:34,318
my mother's ship in the sapphire denail

147
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:36,800
dish this is more just like nice nice

148
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:39,800
tasting nice nice flavor you know give

149
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,800
you a little bit of a buzz

150
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:48,959
too this is also my wake and bake today

151
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:52,359
so I can tell you from three light rips

152
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:55,359
on the vaporizer it is lovely great job

153
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,360
as always concentrated

154
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:02,719
X concentrated evolution

155
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:05,759
craft cannabis products organically

156
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:08,120
grown hand water and trimmed naturally

157
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:11,160
sourced nutrients never sprayed with

158
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:13,639
chemicals why because quality matters

159
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,280
and that's one of the reasons I love to

160
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:19,120
support concentrated

161
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:19,119
X nice packaging as

162
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:29,639
well all right well me turn that guy off

163
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:41,080
I guess we need to get that Dabber out a

164
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:41,079
little bit there we go and out she

165
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:46,639
comes fairly nice little unit it's got a

166
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:48,280
real nice tight little screen laser

167
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,840
perforated on the inside and then it

168
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:52,719
also has a little laser screen

169
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:54,839
perforated on the inside of the uh

170
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,599
mouthpiece which is classic because the

171
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:59,519
last thing I want to taste is remnants

172
00:07:56,598 --> 00:08:01,199
of pot coming through in my mouthpiece

173
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:03,399
when I'm hitting a vaporizer so that's a

174
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,879
real deal breaker for me Grasshopper

175
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:08,679
Vaporizer along with some uh cookies and

176
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:12,199
cream via exotic genetics through

177
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:14,360
concentrated X so I managed to clean the

178
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:16,120
denail all up here for the next little

179
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,960
part of our adventure I'm not going to

180
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:20,240
lie I'm looking pretty forward to this

181
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:22,598
get this nice and

182
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,079
clean oh what should we do should we go

183
00:08:22,598 --> 00:08:28,000
into the rosin next because I find yeah

184
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:29,839
I find you know for me the best the best

185
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,959
the best

186
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:33,759
is the bubble hash that's my favorite

187
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:37,199
I've got two of them right here so why

188
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:39,399
don't we start with um well why don't we

189
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,719
start with the head stash cookies and

190
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:45,799
cream kosher cush dry sift

191
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:47,920
rosin as always beautiful packaging you

192
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:49,679
smell it right away with concentrated X

193
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:52,879
it doesn't take long before you open the

194
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:55,479
package and it's on point got some real

195
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:58,120
lovely looking shaty stuff right

196
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:01,079
here tiny little bubbles really show

197
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:03,000
that it's uh yeah it's it's stable you

198
00:09:01,078 --> 00:09:06,679
know I can flip it off of the

199
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,480
parchment and uh it's a fairly stable

200
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:10,919
product right there so let us have a

201
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,920
little dab of it and we'll talk a little

202
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:14,919
bit about

203
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:17,120
it super clean you open up concentrated

204
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:18,919
uh excess products and there's just no

205
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,078
contaminant whatsoever which is always

206
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:22,958
nice to see uh as you know you're going

207
00:09:21,078 --> 00:09:23,838
to be paying top quality for a product

208
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:26,799
like

209
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:30,200
this all right so let's do this dry sift

210
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:32,958
rosin from concentrated X via the

211
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:35,560
cookies and cream and the Kosher Kush on

212
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:37,518
a freshly clean Sapphire dish that I

213
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:39,679
can't tell you it's just white as white

214
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:42,159
can be really lovely I'll do some macro

215
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:43,799
rips of the bubble hash at least as for

216
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:46,078
me rosin isn't really something very

217
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:48,439
exciting it's an oil watching oil melt

218
00:09:46,078 --> 00:09:50,239
into a liquid is kind of a no-brainer

219
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:53,079
but when you see a solidified chunk of

220
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,720
hash melting into uh and bubbling into a

221
00:09:53,078 --> 00:09:56,838
liquid there's something really quite

222
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,920
visually stunning about that so we will

223
00:09:56,839 --> 00:10:01,200
make sure that we sell uh we share those

224
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:03,240
with you so here we go grab your Dabber

225
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:07,320
if you got them grabbing it to grab the

226
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:07,320
Mother Ship let's do this 3 2

227
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,519
1 oh my God that was so nice that was so

228
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:26,958
light flavored I was expecting it to

229
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:29,519
really pound me but the Kosher Kush

230
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:33,000
seems to really have

231
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,000
Gass up that cookies and

232
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:47,919
cream very very very little product left

233
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,720
on the Halo dish I am just going to

234
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:52,519
quickly grab a Q-tip and we'll be right

235
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:55,360
back grab a nice handful

236
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:56,600
here wow that was really really really

237
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,919
nice

238
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:02,120
rosin um very very little

239
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:04,559
left over on that

240
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:07,320
rosin which is great to

241
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:10,679
see it's definitely what I like to see

242
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:12,360
anyway um you don't want to see a ton of

243
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:15,278
wax membranes or whatever it is that's

244
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:18,000
getting left behind it's nice when the

245
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:20,078
rosin uh you know boils away to almost

246
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,519
nothing pardon me while I catch my

247
00:11:20,078 --> 00:11:25,519
breath I ran down three flights of

248
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:29,639
stairs to grab the

249
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:32,240
Q-tips all right so put the cookies in

250
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:34,759
cream and the kosher sift dry sift that

251
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,320
is definitely head stash these are both

252
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:38,879
the same so we'll put them over there

253
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:41,720
along or actually we'll put them up here

254
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:44,879
with the cooks boom and

255
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:47,240
boom next up some strawberry banana

256
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:50,838
rosin this is a strong

257
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:52,000
cultivar um cookies and cream Kimbo Kush

258
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:54,279
I've never found them to be

259
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,839
overwhelmingly strong as much as I love

260
00:11:54,278 --> 00:11:58,120
the flavors and the Purity and the

261
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:59,680
beautifulness of the resin uh which is

262
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,759
often the case I have to to ad met with

263
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:02,958
a lot of different cultivars

264
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:04,759
particularly ones that taste incredible

265
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:07,199
Calo being a perfect

266
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:10,919
example however with this strawberry

267
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:14,160
banana it really does have oh this one's

268
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:15,919
butter oh my God it really does have

269
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:17,679
this incredibly high turpine profile

270
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:19,479
that I'm telling you when you hit it

271
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:22,198
when you taste it when you have that

272
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:24,399
flavor profile pass across your palette

273
00:12:22,198 --> 00:12:27,078
uh it's unmistakable and you will

274
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:29,519
absolutely remember it in the future so

275
00:12:27,078 --> 00:12:34,198
we're going to take a nice little

276
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:37,600
nice little dab of this buttered up TP

277
00:12:34,198 --> 00:12:40,838
Rich strawberry banana rosin and it is

278
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:46,360
bubble has rosin for those of you

279
00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:46,360
wondering jeez okay here we go

280
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,560
yeah I'm not sure what the THC

281
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:05,559
percentage is in this strawberry banana

282
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:05,559
but it's definitely

283
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:12,240
high with a very unique tarpine profile

284
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:15,079
as well that modulates it in this

285
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,278
powerful sort of way that you actually

286
00:13:15,078 --> 00:13:19,278
very much

287
00:13:16,278 --> 00:13:19,278
feel

288
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:30,039
instantly once again very little residue

289
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:31,799
in the um in the dish maybe a little bit

290
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:34,278
more on the strawberry banana than there

291
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:36,240
was on the dry

292
00:13:34,278 --> 00:13:38,078
sifted

293
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,720
material always nice to make sure you

294
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:41,799
clean both sides of the dish if you get

295
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:44,800
it dirty on the outside it's easy to

296
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:47,078
wipe up boom boom boom get it

297
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:50,399
clean it's always nice to keep these

298
00:13:47,078 --> 00:13:52,919
things clean cleaner we can the less we

299
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:55,278
have to clean them all right and what I

300
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:56,958
mean clean them I mean like the longterm

301
00:13:55,278 --> 00:13:58,399
plugging it into my whip into a

302
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:59,719
different denail that set at a much

303
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,159
warmer temperature sure cuz I know

304
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:04,040
someone's going to say how do you clean

305
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:06,319
your dish bubble man how I clean my dish

306
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:07,958
is simple I unplug my whip I plug it

307
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,120
into my Dil that sits on top of my

308
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:14,198
dabinator and my denail sits around 1,00

309
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:17,959
to 1100° fah and uh it turns this orange

310
00:14:14,198 --> 00:14:19,958
hot the the flat coil and it basically

311
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:21,638
takes about 10 to 15 minutes if you

312
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:23,838
actually are q-tipping it and keeping it

313
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:25,320
clean if you let it get crusty and

314
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,759
someone's hitting some nasty stuff at

315
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:29,240
too hot of a temperature and they're not

316
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:31,800
q-tipping it and it's blacking out uh

317
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:33,440
that'll probably take about an hour an

318
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:35,159
hour and a half at that temperature to

319
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,600
just clean right out you can usually

320
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:39,919
walk over and just blow into it uh and

321
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,040
it'll just clear this uh light light

322
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:44,559
colored dust that seems to dissipate to

323
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:45,958
nothing um that's of course my stash

324
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:47,958
that I'm puffing on it it may be

325
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:49,599
different for you in your stash but uh

326
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:52,119
I'm sharing my own experience with you

327
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,839
here today so let us move on we've hit

328
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:55,639
the two rosins the dry sift rosin and

329
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,959
the bubble hash rosin we've hit the bud

330
00:14:55,639 --> 00:15:00,799
which was very light but tasty kind of

331
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:02,439
set the motion almost almost like uh a

332
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:04,879
little sip of orange juice before

333
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:07,480
breakfast if you will so uh we've had

334
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:10,360
the eggs we've had some toast uh let's

335
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:12,120
get into the meat and potatoes of this

336
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:14,199
breakfast which is kind of funny to say

337
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:16,560
as a vegetarian um I'm going to go for

338
00:15:14,198 --> 00:15:19,120
GB as I did just hit the strawberry

339
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:22,000
banana and he's got a nice little method

340
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,078
that he um he seals these jars with a

341
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,679
sticker that goes all the way around so

342
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:28,439
you definitely want to use something

343
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:30,519
sharp that you can kind of scrape away

344
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:33,279
at the stick

345
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:36,159
er um not always the easiest to open

346
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:37,679
I'll have to admit but uh I guess in

347
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:39,559
that sense they're not opening by

348
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:41,479
accident which is always a good thing

349
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:43,758
when it comes to stash and

350
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:46,759
containers and it also really lets you

351
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:49,560
know like if you open this to look at it

352
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:52,680
you have absolutely breached the label

353
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:54,879
there's no trying to trick anyone into

354
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:57,958
thinking that you have not opened this

355
00:15:54,879 --> 00:16:01,720
when it's been opened so I do appreciate

356
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:03,159
that there we go I usually just pull the

357
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:06,079
little remnants

358
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:08,078
of material uh sticker that are hanging

359
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:11,679
just so they don't end up in the

360
00:16:08,078 --> 00:16:14,278
hash and uh yeah go give concentrated X

361
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:17,239
if you haven't already uh a follow on

362
00:16:14,278 --> 00:16:19,559
Instagram good guy posting beautiful

363
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:21,519
photos and good information of his grow

364
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:24,239
and his compost teas

365
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:26,120
Etc uh would you look at that I'd love

366
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:29,759
to show you guys this but it's all on

367
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:32,159
the side it's all on the side

368
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,839
it's never fun when it does that

369
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:35,439
especially because a lot of it is Fallen

370
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:39,279
this is one of the reasons I personally

371
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:42,759
am not a huge fan of the

372
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:45,639
um parchment paper

373
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:48,039
inside um a plastic little case like

374
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:50,560
this I find that I might have just

375
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:54,519
preferred the hash to be right

376
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:56,879
into um let me put that down there just

377
00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:58,560
right into the case but uh We've saved

378
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:00,919
the day nothing too uh brutal here

379
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:02,399
happen I've managed to uh get a nice

380
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:04,558
little piece out of here it looks like

381
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,720
it's kind of buttery so I'm going to

382
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:08,519
have to not be able to pick it up the

383
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,240
way I normally

384
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:14,240
do

385
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:17,120
but get a little heat happening on our

386
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:20,679
Dabber a little heat can go a long way

387
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:22,519
there we go picked up a nice chunk not

388
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:24,640
going to lie my mouth watered a tiny

389
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:28,160
little bit as I picked that

390
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,440
up and so this is very very valuable

391
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,160
stuff that you do don't want to if

392
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,558
you're leaving it open you don't want to

393
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:35,840
be leaving it in any situation where it

394
00:17:33,558 --> 00:17:38,319
could be bumped and knocked off the

395
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:41,839
table because let me tell you grown men

396
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:45,119
will weep grown men will weep all right

397
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:46,119
let's hit this concentrated x 120 Micron

398
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:49,479
bubble

399
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:51,599
hash uh strawberry banana no golden

400
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:53,360
Berry that's right all right it's a new

401
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:58,359
flavor I haven't hit this one yet let's

402
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:58,359
give it a shot smells beautiful

403
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,200
interesting yeah that's a different

404
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:17,199
profile

405
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,319
completely has a little bit of a berry

406
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,360
taste going in but it's it changes into

407
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:24,079
a fuy kind of cush but then at the end

408
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:27,599
when you exhale it's got this soapy sort

409
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:27,599
of thing going on

410
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:39,199
yeah I taste that Berry on the

411
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:41,720
inhale kind of taste it on your lips a

412
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:46,200
little bit but a really interesting

413
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:46,200
middle part to this that's uh

414
00:18:52,759 --> 00:18:58,158
fuy definitely melted in a very unique

415
00:18:55,679 --> 00:19:00,519
way left a a quite a bit more residual

416
00:18:58,159 --> 00:19:05,480
on the screen obviously being bubble

417
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:08,038
has um didn't melt right away did not

418
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:11,279
melt right away it kind of uh sat there

419
00:19:08,038 --> 00:19:14,079
for a second made me think for about

420
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:16,359
half a second that maybe I unplugged the

421
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:18,639
denail and that it wasn't on anymore and

422
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:22,000
then I saw it sort of slump and start

423
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:25,200
melting usually a sign of a product that

424
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,720
is a little less melty than more melty

425
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,880
but I'll tell you the flavor and the

426
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:33,720
obviously kind of hard to describe the

427
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:35,840
high being um behind two rips of uh Ros

428
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:39,200
and dry sift and bubble hash and

429
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:41,399
vaporizer rips of kind herb obviously uh

430
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,319
I can describe the effects that I feel

431
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,919
after I hit it on top of what I've

432
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:46,558
already hit but I'm not giving an

433
00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:49,240
accurate description of the potency of

434
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:51,319
these particular cultivars concentrates

435
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:52,919
uh through the wake and bake as you if

436
00:19:51,319 --> 00:19:55,119
you uh you know if you did that it's

437
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:56,600
going to be substantially different than

438
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:59,439
uh hitting them all in a row the way I

439
00:19:56,599 --> 00:20:02,119
do but um I'm a fi

440
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,919
so and perhaps I will add wake and bakes

441
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:05,719
uh just not on this particular video but

442
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,919
you might just see small little wake and

443
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:09,519
bake videos hit the YouTube I'll try to

444
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,919
do a wake and bake with each one of

445
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:14,879
these in the next couple of weeks uh and

446
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:16,679
in the meantime I guess we are down to

447
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,880
our last

448
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:21,400
cultivar uh the strawberry banana bubble

449
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,320
HH 120 this is amazing I've already

450
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:26,600
smoked like a couple of grams of it it

451
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:28,359
was just spectacular uh took some

452
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:29,959
amazing macro photographs of it which

453
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:32,678
I've already shared on Instagram and I

454
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:35,038
will share on this video and uh just

455
00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:38,600
impressive you know really really nice

456
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:41,200
nice nice product uh lot of energy and

457
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:43,558
time goes into um controlling the

458
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:46,200
variables to come up with a product like

459
00:20:43,558 --> 00:20:48,399
this so so my hats are off to you

460
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,080
concentrated X it's uh it's a lot of

461
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,840
work you know it's not just about

462
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:53,759
watering some plants there's a lot of

463
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:56,558
work that goes into finding these

464
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:59,359
cultivars and then growing them properly

465
00:20:56,558 --> 00:21:00,960
uh etc etc it's not easy easy as you can

466
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:03,439
see because otherwise everyone would

467
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:06,960
have these products and uh clearly they

468
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:08,880
don't all right so actually let's use

469
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:12,278
this one seeing as that one's a little

470
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,960
hot these carb caps get hot I'll tell

471
00:21:12,278 --> 00:21:15,679
you doesn't take long sitting on the

472
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:19,278
Halo dish at

473
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:21,880
580° uh before it gets fairly hot all

474
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:24,798
right here we go strawberry

475
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:27,278
banana straw

476
00:21:24,798 --> 00:21:30,480
Nana this one's got the little top on it

477
00:21:27,278 --> 00:21:33,759
I like that

478
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:36,440
oh she's on the side as well but that's

479
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:38,200
okay that is just such fire definitely

480
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:43,000

00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,200

00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:21,799
doing it via the computer and so I would

494
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:23,720
ask them can you put a poster up with it

495
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:26,440
if you take four small pieces can you

496
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:30,200
put a poster on the wall that is great

497
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:32,798
hash this is a poster hash so to you

498
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:34,759
concentrated X for the last rip of this

499
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:37,400

00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:47,200
a be able to acquire this beautiful

503
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:47,200
product so keep doing you and uh here we

504
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:59,319
go what the [ __ ]

505
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:14,079
all right well it's officially a good

506
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:17,278
review man maybe even a great review

507
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:19,240
because indeed as you guys can see the

508
00:23:17,278 --> 00:23:22,038
the whip somehow got unplugged a little

509
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:24,038
bit and it did turn off the denail I

510
00:23:22,038 --> 00:23:26,200
don't even know what I hit that golden

511
00:23:24,038 --> 00:23:28,798
Berry rip at I think I'm going to hit

512
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:30,880
the golden Berry again here but uh for

513
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:35,359
now I've got the strawberry banana

514
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:38,679
loaded up loaded it up real nice and of

515
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:40,719
course I should probably clean this Halo

516
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:43,400
dish that is uh smoking off from the

517
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:46,000
remnants of the hit that I hit at uh oh

518
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:47,400
I don't know room temperature so I

519
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,960
thought that was funny usually I would

520
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:51,960
edit stuff out like that but uh why I

521
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:55,000
can show you guys my failures as well as

522
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:56,679
my successes and uh it's something uh to

523
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,038
laugh about anyway so I thought it was

524
00:23:56,679 --> 00:24:01,960
kind of funny I'm sure you were like

525
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:05,319
what the [ __ ] anyway let's do this last

526

530
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:35,919
my favorite by far of everything from

531
00:24:33,558 --> 00:24:38,720
the dry sift rosin to the bud to the

532
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:41,640
bubble has Ros and the bubble hash hits

533
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,798
just like I guess I am biased being

534
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:46,520

535
