00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:21,720
he now after I uh volunteered for a long

6
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:24,879
time around here and did a few things

7
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:26,439
and buged them enough to give me a job

8
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:29,160
well not exactly before I started

9
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:32,719
working I finally got a thing to do with

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,159
Mark there was a situation that came up

11
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:38,359
here in the city where they were trying

12
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:40,159
to even ban herbs and spices and put all

13
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:41,719
sorts of regulations on it so we were

14
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:45,238
going out around the city putting up

15
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:47,600
tables and giving out flyers and I was

16
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:50,519
elected to go with Mark set up a table

17
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:53,679
in front of the uh library on denin

18
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,280

Vancouver but it was not as

81
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:45,599
[Music]

82
00:03:43,158 --> 00:03:47,519
cool but I remember Marius as well in

83
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:48,798
the old days we had a club at Simon FR

84
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,719
University he would come with his

85
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:54,120
marijuana flag and March around and

86
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:56,280
stuff and uh Chris Bennett was a Venable

87
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,799
old man of the Wana movement to me back

88
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,158
then he'd come with this little piece of

89
00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:05,480
hemp Fabric and stories of marijuana

90
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:07,078

91
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:09,078
five's real this is

92
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:12,000
true

93
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:13,360
that and it looking back in all those

94
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,400
years and all those times it makes me

95
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,400
realize how much we've really

96
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,120
accomplished over the last 10 20 years

97
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,918
and how many changes we've really made

98
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,680
in this in this country and around the

99
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:25,478
world and what our influence has been

100
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:28,319
and um oh God I don't know there's a lot

101
00:04:25,478 --> 00:04:30,639
of stories but I I remember reading Mark

102
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:33,439
first time I guess uh the late great Ian

103
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:36,360
Hunter was uh putting on some Rally or a

104
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:38,319
pub crawl in Vancouver and I just was

105
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,319
heading off to South Africa for 10 weeks

106
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:43,000
which was a great time a lot of good

107
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:44,399
weed down there a lot of good hash and

108
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,759
uh and when I came and he said I'm going

109
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:47,159
to be opening this store with this guy

110
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,600
Mark gamry or something I haven't really

111
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,320
heard of Mark before I don't know why I

112
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,840
heard of Chris Clay and some other

113
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:54,000
people out east there but we were mostly

114
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:56,279
doing our own thing in Vancouver and I

115
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,600
thought okay Dre Ian had a lot of flaky

116
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:58,879
ideas and I thought well he's going open

117
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,759
a store good luck to him I hope that

118
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:03,319
works out and I came back 10 weeks later

119
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,400
and uh there was this beautiful tiny

120
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:07,159
little store on Hastings and it's

121
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:09,038
amazing to think that how small it was

122
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:11,639
but a tiny little place that was and how

123
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:15,879
huge multi level floors locations all

124
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:17,879
the things that we have now but uh and

125
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:20,038
um I started working there for a while

126
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:21,560
with regular SN on holidays I came in to

127
00:05:20,038 --> 00:05:24,879
work behind the counter a job which I

128
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:27,399
was not very good at at all I'm not made

129
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:29,439
for that kind of work I think I uh me

130
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:31,399
and another fellow maronia were hired to

131
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:32,639
to so temporarily mark would be out

132
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:34,239
there sleeping in the front lot and

133
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,600
working away and I'd be like sleeping on

134
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,199
the front desk there trying to stay

135
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,479
awake so I didn't I didn't get to stay

136
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:42,919
on on that job which was for the best I

137
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:44,359
think Mark made a wise decision on that

138
00:05:42,918 --> 00:05:46,000
but uh but what I was good at was

139
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,680
writing and editing and Mark was working

140
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,639
on a newsletter the marijuana H

141
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,560
newsletter it started off pretty small

142
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,680
and Mark when he came had jillions of

143
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,280
projects and managed to offend pretty

144
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:58,000
much everybody in the marijuana that was

145
00:05:56,279 --> 00:06:00,119
already here and told us all we were all

146
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:05,560
ads and not very good at it he was going

147
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:08,000
to so much better and he did and uh so

148
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,560
and was you know it was interesting

149
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,079
seeing all these people how aggravated

150
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,800
they were by Mark and pretty much all of

151
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:14,918
them ended up working for him eventually

152
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,720
and

153
00:06:14,918 --> 00:06:19,318
uh and that's a beautiful thing and yeah

154
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,160
so I started working on that newsletter

155
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:23,319
and uh soon we turned it into cannabis

156
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,319
Culture magazine and that's how I spent

157
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:26,680
in the next 10 years was working on that

158
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:28,879
with Marcus publisher and we went

159
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:32,199
through so many raids and so many

160
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:33,800
challenges so many things and one of the

161
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:35,680
things I learned from Mark mostly is not

162
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,400
to give up and to keep on pushing and to

163
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,000
find new ways you can bounce back from

164
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:40,719
so many challenges and so many things

165
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,759
and if you just keep on going and don't

166
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,160
don't stop find a new angle find a new

167
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:47,720
way and just be persistent and you'd be

168
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:50,919
amazed that you can get away with and uh

169
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,919
I certainly take him that to

170
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:58,839
heart I'm just some of the things you

171
00:06:56,839 --> 00:07:00,719
know the the night my daughter was born

172
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:02,478
um I have a daughter Lily she's 11 years

173
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,160
old she's a cover girl on cannabis

174
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:07,038
culture and a very early issue there a

175
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:10,720
little child with a big adant joint in

176
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:13,439
her hand she'll sign copies for you most

177
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,160
mostly and uh as you know the night well

178
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:17,240
the night that she was born was the same

179
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:19,199
night that uh one of I think the biggest

180
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,918
raid that we went through that was a

181
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,240
really defining raid one that ultimately

182
00:07:20,918 --> 00:07:24,878
led to the W store shutting down for a

183
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,280
while and Mar shelling everything off

184
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:29,080
and going into the ma order seeds only

185
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:31,359
it was a very traumatic difficult raid

186
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:33,359
and it was a pretty strange Karma my

187
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,919
partner at the time Yan Lily's mom she's

188
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,160
a lovely woman she was the manager of

189
00:07:34,918 --> 00:07:38,878
the Cannabis Cafe and I was the editor

190
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:41,360
of cannabis Culture magazine and our

191
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:43,960
whole romances tied up in a lot of that

192
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,598
stuff and uh that daughter being uh

193
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:47,120
being born that night that that raid was

194
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:48,598
happening with some pretty weird Karma

195
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,598
you know going downstairs and see my

196
00:07:48,598 --> 00:07:53,399
friends and allies getting getting

197
00:07:50,598 --> 00:07:55,158
punished by the police on TV and uh and

198
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:57,079
upstairs and was given birth to our to

199
00:07:55,158 --> 00:07:58,439
our child that was uh I don't know one

200
00:07:57,079 --> 00:08:00,038
of those weird karmas I don't know what

201
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:02,519
it all means but it was very magical

202
00:08:00,038 --> 00:08:04,199
night in many ways and uh and although a

203
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:06,359
lot of things changed that night it also

204
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:08,199
pushed us to new to new things and I

205
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:10,000
always you know seeing Mark the the

206
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:11,598
pushing into seeds was often in a time

207
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,680
of desperation we got to do something

208
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:14,038
new we got to find a way to make more

209
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,079
money put that Seed Catalog in the

210
00:08:14,038 --> 00:08:18,439
magazine or put your seing seed to the

211
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:20,878
US or whatever the decision was at that

212
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:22,439
time at that to make that money to keep

213
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,439
things going pushing things forward and

214
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:25,680
you know I you don't ever know where

215
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:27,399
it's going to end up where it's going to

216
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,519
be and I don't think Mark imagined that

217
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:30,878
that that 10 years later 15 years l

218
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:32,199
later he'd be sitting here in this room

219
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,038
with all these people doing these things

220
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,959
you know we knew it was going to be a

221
00:08:34,038 --> 00:08:37,879
long and strange Adventure but you never

222
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:39,399
really know what's going to happen and

223
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:40,759
and something I I've seen about Mark is

224
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:42,440
he always really lives in the present

225
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:44,559
and tries to focus on the present moment

226
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:46,600
in a very kind of zen master sort of way

227
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:48,159
not really Ming too much about anything

228
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,040
beyond the next week or the next few

229
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:52,278
hours really in terms of getting that

230
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:53,879
money today or just do deal with it and

231
00:08:52,278 --> 00:08:56,559
uh and we'll find those sign those

232
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:58,159
Solutions tomorrow on the next day and

233
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:59,439
uh and getting in Deb and having these

234
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:00,838
challenges being really highly

235
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,360
motivating in terms of we got to find

236
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:04,480
that money somehow we got to get to work

237
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:06,159
and get up early and and make that

238
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,159
happen and then give it all the way so

239
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:09,159
we can start it again the next

240
00:09:15,078 --> 00:09:19,039
day so I just also want to say one thing

241
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:21,360
you know that we're here and it's sort

242
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:23,000
of like Mark like dying or something

243
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,320
terrible is happening but we should be

244
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,278
celebrating because this is really the

245
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,320
the Pinnacle of Mark's career this is

246
00:09:26,278 --> 00:09:30,278
what it's been working towards the whole

247
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,200
time that he's been doing these things

248
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:35,200
and and and and and we find we when we

249
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,839
prohibit something well or we we ban

250
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,000
something we make it stronger than ever

251
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:40,399
before and whether it's marijuana and

252
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,679
sometimes I wonder if marijuana hadn't

253
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,759
been banned if if our culture would be

254
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:46,879
the same as it was and if somehow this

255
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:49,000
prohibition period wasn't necessary for

256
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:51,120
us to really understand how useful this

257
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,200
plan can be for us and that by Banning

258
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,720
it they made us somehow stronger and you

259
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,399
know what that NP convention that I was

260
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,959
at when they banned me from being there

261
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,879
they made me a hundred times stronger

262
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:01,559
now the fact that I go to an n

263
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:03,439
it's new nobody cared before but now

264
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:05,958
that they ban me now it's a big deal

265
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,959
that I got

266
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,959
in and so you know when they come and

267
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:14,879
they raid Mark or they put these

268
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:16,359
challenges together it's not fun no one

269
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:18,838
no one wants to do that and it's not

270
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:20,919
easy for anybody certainly not for Mark

271
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:24,040
but it's also it's part of the process

272
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:26,120
of of making these changes and that by

273
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:27,679
by by this these things happening it's

274
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,879
only going to make Mark more powerful

275
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:31,759
like Obi-Wan Kenobi and and dark Creator

276
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:33,159
when you strike him down stronger than

277
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:35,120
ever before if the if these things

278
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:36,679
hadn't happened Mark's voice would not

279
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,200
be able to reach so many people around

280
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:40,599
the world and we would not be able to do

281
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,278
the things that we're doing and so this

282
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,480
this attention that it brings it's a

283
00:10:42,278 --> 00:10:46,200
positive thing and it's not fun for Mark

284
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,399
to go to jail for those of us who love

285
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,800
them and you know we can cry our tears

286
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,278
at a different place or whatever but I

287
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:54,240
know we're all going to mism mark but

288
00:10:52,278 --> 00:10:56,000
it's it's it's an important thing that's

289
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,440
happening and by doing this it's going

290
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,120
to bring so many other people that are

291
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,920
also hurting of there that are also in

292
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,600
prison and I don't have these groups

293
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:05,159
around them to help them people that are

294
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,120
alone in jail and there's millions of

295
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:11,759
them all around the world and Mark he

296
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,759
has behind

297
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:18,240
get out sure that he stay and as soon as

298
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,759
possible but most marijuana pars don't

299
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,159
have those people and so what we're

300
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:23,078
doing here it's more than just about

301
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:25,480
Mark and we all recognize that that Mark

302
00:11:23,078 --> 00:11:27,319
is is sacrificing himself for a greater

303
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:29,440
good and I hope that that inspires all

304
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:31,839
of us to also make those sacrifices to

305
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,160
put some money into this or to or to put

306
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,000
a little more effort into it and to work

307
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:37,439
just a little bit harder because we've

308
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,399
seen the Terrible Things of this war can

309
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,360
do to us and we've seen what kind of

310
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:42,879
things we can do to make a change and I

311
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,720
just hope that that Mark being in that

312
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:47,120
jail inspires us to do more inspires

313
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,000
Canadians and Americans and people

314
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,720
around the world to do more to end this

315
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,720
war and if that's the case then every

316
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,639
day he spends in jail of time well spent

317
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,759
and Mark will come back stronger and

318
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,360
more powerful and and a better human

319
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:59,879
being and a better person for these

320
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,680
experiences I know we well and I know

321
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:03,559
he'll survive and thrive anywhere he

322
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:07,638
goes and bring life and goodness because

323
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:07,638
that's what Mark Henry does

324
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:22,149
[Applause]

325
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,800
thank W well
