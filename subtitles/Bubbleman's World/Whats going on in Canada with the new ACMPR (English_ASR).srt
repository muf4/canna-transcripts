8
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,840
battle um is uh you know in every in

9
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,480
every respective area where cannabis

10
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,359
legalization is going on whether it's

11
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:51,119
under medical or recreational offices uh

12
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:55,198
you have these U uh these Gatekeepers

13
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:58,599
these oracles these these certain uh

14
00:00:55,198 --> 00:01:01,159
individuals that have uh been there for

15
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,719
a long long time in this battle for a

16
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:04,719
long long time because before this

17
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:11,079
became an issue of Economics it was an

18
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:11,079
issue of just pure Justice okay and uh

19
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:16,280
uh I

20
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:20,600
mean it's so important to understand

21
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:23,599
that that when when we're the there's

22
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:26,118
there's how do I say this I'm sry I

23
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:28,798
never prepare any notes by the way um

24
00:01:26,118 --> 00:01:30,400
but obviously you can tell uh there's

25
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:35,360
oracles there's Gaye and these

26
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:37,320
Gatekeepers are are what we go to as the

27
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:41,519
foundation from what everything Springs

28
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:45,478
from and there's a certain amount of uh

29
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:45,478
lawyers can be real shyers

30
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:52,280
okay but in every but in every that's

31
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,880
what I was trying

32
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:56,200
to but in every in every in every

33
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:58,798
respective area where there is the

34
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:01,560
legalization and Recreation recreational

35
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:05,399

36
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:08,719
lawyers that are Hardy activists there's

37
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:10,878
always a few lawyers that actually Lobby

38
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:14,919
against their own interests in terms of

39
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:17,840
making money and that is by reducing and

40
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:20,280

themselves as much as we are um yeah I'm

63
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:26,719
going to just give you the format of

64
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:27,598
what we're going to do here uh today I'm

65
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:29,400
going to give a little bit of an

66
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:30,598
introduction of these two fine gentlemen

67
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,519
in my

68
00:03:30,598 --> 00:03:35,919
give an overview of Canada's current

69
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:37,799
medical cannabis regulatory policies I'm

70
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:40,639
going to pose a couple of questions to

71
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:42,120
to these very smart individuals and

72
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:44,039
they're hopefully to make me look good

73
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,519
with their answers and then we're going

74
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:47,199
to kind of turn it into just a

75
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,120
discussion we're hoping to have a lot of

76
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:51,318
participation from the audience uh I

77
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,400
think you know if you've got a question

78
00:03:51,318 --> 00:03:55,199
about the medical regime the transition

79
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,519
towards legalization it's probably

80
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:59,199
shared by everyone in the room uh and

81
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:02,120
we'll do our best to sort of dust off

82
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:03,798
our our the balls and and prognosticate

83
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,400
a bit and and try to talk about how

84
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:08,159
things are right now and and where

85
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:10,000
things might be going as we move this uh

86
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:13,919
this policy this industry this culture

87
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:17,160
forward here in Canada so to my right uh

88
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:19,159
joined uh on the panel here is Rob Lori

89
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,840
uh he's the principal of AD lome law

90
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:24,840

91
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:26,560
attended UBC uh in Oxford University was

92
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:28,719
called the bar in the United Kingdom in

93
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,560
2006 in province of British Columbia in

94
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,520
2011 uh Rob's doing a ton of work right

95
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,399
now working with dispensaries and and

96
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:38,319
others in the Canabis industry here in

97
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:39,959
Vancouver and really across the province

98
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:43,399
uh and it's a real pleasure to have him

99
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:43,399
on the stage with us right

100
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:52,680
now immediately to Rob's right is a man

101
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:57,439
who probably needs no introduction he's

102
00:04:52,680 --> 00:05:00,160
the The Godfather of ganja litigation

103

00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,639
of

105
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,759
our I think it's fair to say without

106
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:08,759
John Conway Rob and I would be uh not

107
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:10,120
doing what we're doing uh and certainly

108
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:12,680
not doing it anywhere near as

109
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:17,199
successfully it's John Conroy QC Conroy

110
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:19,199
law uh and and really his list of

111

00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,478
fighting for human rights and fighting

113
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,918
for people's rights and being founder of

114

1971 uh there's not much you can say my

116
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:32,120
mentor one of best lawyers I've ever

117
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:35,000
known one of the best people I've ever

118
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,000
known that's John

119
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,199
C thank

120
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:45,960
you thank

121
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:49,199
you so let's kick this off with a sort

122
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:53,560
of where we are right now um as a result

123
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:57,439
of uh litigation uh brought by U John

124
00:05:53,560 --> 00:06:00,879
and and a team of lawyers um back in

125
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:02,680
2013 2014 uh when the government of

126
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:05,199
Canada moved away from the medical

127
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:07,680
marijuana access regulations a medical

128
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:10,639
Canabis exemption scheme that had its

129
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,400
primary focus personal and caregiver

130
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:16,199
designated production for a limited

131
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:18,399
number of patients um a lawsuit was

132
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:20,520
filed called Allard versus candada

133
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:22,359
because the government candidate chose

134
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:24,159
to transition away from that system

135
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:27,120
towards a commercially oriented system

136
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,160
called the mmpr or Marland for medical

137
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,038
purposes regulations that system took

138
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:34,520
away home and and personal and caregiver

139
00:06:32,038 --> 00:06:37,199
production rights uh entirely from all

140
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:40,439
patients uh and it forced you instead to

141
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:42,319
access your cannabis from uh a group of

142
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:44,038
then non-existing but now existing

143
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,400
licensed producers who have managed to

144
00:06:44,038 --> 00:06:49,759
navigate a very top heavy bureaucracy

145
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:52,598
and obtain licenses to produce and self

146
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:55,080
cations I think it's fair to say that

147
00:06:52,598 --> 00:06:56,360
that system has not worked very well uh

148
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:58,719
up to this point I don't think we

149
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:02,400
necessarily need to be labor that right

150
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:06,400
now um but that lawsuit triggered uh

151
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:08,038
success uh earlier this year uh the mmpr

152
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:10,038
was struck down in their entirety as

153
00:07:08,038 --> 00:07:13,439
being unconstitutional in February of

154
00:07:10,038 --> 00:07:15,560
this year uh the court in a very I

155
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:18,879
thought well thought out and strong

156
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:20,240
opinion eviscerated the crown Witnesses

157
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:22,160
uh who suggested that there was some

158
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,120
sort of intrinsic danger in producing

159
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,319
cannabis and need destroy your homes and

160
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:29,759
burn your neighborhoods down and do all

161
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:32,319
these terrible things that was

162
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,759
because it's not true uh not believed by

163
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,960
the court and so uh the court gave the

164
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:39,160
government six months to fix the access

165
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:40,359
problems existing with the mmpr and so

166
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,240
what the government did is brought in

167
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:44,520
this new acronym this new regulatory

168
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,120
scheme in August of this year called the

169
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:49,878
acmpr so we're really in the infancy of

170
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,280
this new program and the acmpr the

171
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:54,560
access to cannabis for medical purposes

172
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:56,079
uh regulations prolongated under the

173
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,478
control drugs and Substances Act

174
00:07:56,079 --> 00:08:00,359
essentially did did a couple of things

175
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:02,279
they breathed new life into the

176
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,439
commercial production aspects of the

177
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:06,878
mmpr that was sort of brought back but

178
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:08,879
the licensed producer system remains in

179
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:11,240
place it is not been significantly

180
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,800
streamlined as of yet there continue to

181
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,840
be hundreds of applications in the

182
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,639
pipeline that aren't really moving at

183
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:18,598
the pace that are necessary becomes it's

184
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:22,720
also very difficult to navigate and they

185
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:25,918
sort of mushed that together um um with

186
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:29,199
the old MMA uh and and in effect the

187
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:31,318
acmpr and the old mm are pretty much the

188
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:33,759
same they feature pretty much the same

189
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:35,158
process we're getting uh it's no longer

190
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:36,799
called the license now it's called the

191
00:08:35,158 --> 00:08:38,399
registration I'll probably call it a

192
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,838
license at time during the course of

193
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,679
this talk but it it's basically the same

194
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:44,279
alpath ACC physician signs a medical

195
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:46,199
documents sets out your dosage you

196
00:08:44,278 --> 00:08:48,439
submit that to the to the government you

197
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,759
can then register yourself as a personal

198
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,720
producer of a number of plants that are

199
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:55,278
calculated based on that dosage at

200
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,440
roughly five plans per gram per day for

201
00:08:55,278 --> 00:09:00,159
indoor production or two plans per gram

202
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,160
per day for outdoor production

203
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:04,120
um or you can designate someone to

204
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:07,000
produce for you on your behalf they

205
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:09,759
become the grower uh and they can then

206
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,879
for and they can charge you uh they can

207
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:13,919
provide the medicine to you designated

208
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:15,838
producers can service at most a maximum

209
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:17,199
of two patients that's a feature the old

210
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,120
system that was preserved in the new

211
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,040
system I think a constitutional we can

212
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,600
maybe get into that later and you can

213
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:26,799
have a total of four uh production

214
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:29,639
licenses or registrations at any one

215
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:33,078
physical site again that's a whole over

216
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:35,240
from the old system um there are a

217
00:09:33,078 --> 00:09:37,838
number of tweaks and features uh to the

218
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:39,079
acmpr but sort of broad brush Strokes

219
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:42,320
that that's what we have we have the

220
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:43,919
mmpr and the F muchh together and you

221
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,839
have one system for commercial producers

222
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:48,719
and one system for home and or

223
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:51,160
designated producers uh the injunction

224
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,440
that was granted that preserved mm

225
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:55,399
rights for about 28,000 patients

226
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,760
continues to have Vitality today if you

227
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:58,559
were protected then you're still

228
00:09:56,759 --> 00:10:00,399
protected now government's going to have

229
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:01,958
to go back to to try to undo that

230
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,159
injunction and they may do that at some

231
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:07,439
point in the future if however anything

232
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:11,838
needed to change from that status quo as

233
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:13,880
of at the end of 20 uh 13 early 2014 you

234
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,320
need to now go through the acmpr to

235
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:18,120
moove your licenses to to grow at a

236
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,760
different location to increase your

237
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:22,159
dosages to change your designated

238
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:23,759
producer any any changes to the status

239
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:25,519
quo at the time of the injunction

240
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:28,759
requiring you to be the new participant

241
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:30,278
in the new system so that's the broad

242
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:33,278
brush Strokes overview I'm going to kick

243
00:10:30,278 --> 00:10:36,519
this off by uh asking rob a

244
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:39,000
question uh and that's uh if in his

245
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:40,519
review of the new acmpr are there

246
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,399
pressure points and issues that he's

247
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:45,919
identified that could be problematic in

248
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:48,039
that regime as we move forward all right

249
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:50,759
Thank you Kirk and let me just start off

250
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:53,278
by saying it's a real honor to be up on

251
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:55,519
a panel with these two and to be part of

252
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:57,879
this great conference so give yourself a

253
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,839
round of applause for coming

254
00:10:57,879 --> 00:11:02,958
here all right

255
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:07,000
so limitations and problems with the

256
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:09,199
acmpr now to start out with this acmpr

257
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,078
was really you know it's designed to

258
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:15,839
salvage two medical programs that have

259
00:11:13,078 --> 00:11:18,278
been in place for a while the difficulty

260
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,880
is is as Kirk mentioned in the panel

261
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:22,838
this morning doctors have been forced

262
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:25,679
with the role of Gatekeepers and so

263
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:28,320
under the acmpr you still have to go to

264
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:30,799
a doctor to get a what would be known as

265
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,600
a prescription usually and uh the

266
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:35,278
problem still is doctors are not signing

267
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:38,680
those uh as readily as we would like to

268
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:41,278
see so that's one issue um even though

269
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:43,239
if you do get a permit under the acmpr

270
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:46,120
to grow cannabis well it's not like you

271
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:49,360
can pop down to crop King seeds or you

272
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:52,360
know Mark Amor's or wherever you have to

273
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,399
buy your seeds from limited Supply and

274
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:56,639
limited sources so in my opinion that

275
00:11:54,399 --> 00:12:00,240
doesn't really seem like a free and fair

276
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:03,440
market um again Limited strains the

277
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:07,480
licensed producers uh in many respects

278
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:10,560
are limited with what they can supply

279
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:13,959
the patient Market with respect to what

280
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:16,359
health Canada says they can so really if

281
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:18,599
unless you fit within that very those

282
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:20,680
very limited exceptions you have a

283
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,560
problem even if you do get your

284
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:24,919
prescription or

285
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:27,759
recommendation to grow well what do you

286
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:31,240
do for the six three to six months of

287
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:33,198
your first cycle right so again that's

288
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:35,879
why we're seeing dispensaries

289
00:12:33,198 --> 00:12:38,399
unfortunately or fortunately however you

290
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:41,480
want to see it are really going to

291
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:43,958
remain the the reasonable dignified

292
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,959
patient

293
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:53,799
access and um let me just see the other

294
00:12:52,278 --> 00:12:56,838
Pitfall

295
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:59,439
um I'll give you a story my dad was

296
00:12:56,839 --> 00:13:01,959
recently diagnosed with cancer and had

297
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:04,079
followed the law and waited for him to

298
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:07,799
get a doctor's prescription and so on

299
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:10,319
and so forth his stage one uh can

300
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:13,078
reptile cancer would have spread in fact

301
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:15,839
I gave him a an address of a farm and

302
00:13:13,078 --> 00:13:17,559
Mission and he's been on the suppository

303
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:20,199
so I guess it illustrates the the

304
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:22,000
problem of do I follow the law or do I

305
00:13:20,198 --> 00:13:23,958
help my dad and I can assure you I'm

306
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
going to help my dad and I know the

307
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:28,198
majority of the folks out there that are

308
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,519
requiring access to cannabis can't get

309
00:13:28,198 --> 00:13:32,479
it without feeling like they're in a

310
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:34,600
position where they're breaking the law

311
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:37,800
and and I think that's the biggest issue

312
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:41,199
that this legalization question has to

313
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:43,240
address so those are my my thoughts on

314
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:46,039
the limitation and

315
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:49,079
pitfalls what do you think her I you

316
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:51,399
know I think Rob identified six points

317
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:53,559
uh one was the doctor's gatekeeper the

318
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:55,559
second one was The Limited sources for

319
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:57,958
starting genetics third is limited

320
00:13:55,559 --> 00:14:00,119
strains available in the lp system

321
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:02,359
fourth is access home producers or

322
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:05,039
designated producers during increase

323
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:06,480
Cycles or downtimes or get crop failures

324
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:08,799
the fifth is that dispensaries are not

325
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,440
part of the legal regime and yet they're

326
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:13,240
the primary access point for most

327
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:15,519
patients in Canada and then six is is

328
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:17,639
related to that and that's there's a

329
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:21,000
limited range of products available in

330
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:22,959
the lawful regime so John hearing

331
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,958
hearing these problems identified uh

332
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:26,799
with the

333
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:29,278
acmpr um what are your thoughts on as we

334
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:31,479
transition towards legalization

335
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:33,159
um how some of these different uh points

336
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:36,759
can be

337
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:40,198
addressed well my hope is that uh many

338
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:42,839
people will apply under the acmpr

339
00:14:40,198 --> 00:14:44,758
whether they like it or not if for no

340
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:47,279
other reason than to tell us what

341
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:50,039
problems they're having with because

342
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:52,559
remember Allard uh the injunction

343
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:54,519
continues until the court orders

344
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:56,479
otherwise or until further order of the

345
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:59,039
court so those people who were fortunate

346
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:01,120
to be grandfathered by the injunction

347
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:03,120
are protected by the injunction but they

348
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,879
they don't lose that status if they

349
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:08,440
applied under the acmpr and you've got

350
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:11,039
all of the people who weren't uh who

351
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:13,199
were called the left outs or who who

352
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:17,278
weren't covered by the the out

353
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:19,958
injunction who now can finally uh apply

354
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:21,958
to get their licenses again and at the

355
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:23,719
locations that they want to because one

356
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:25,359
of the biggest problems was trying to

357
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:29,000
change your your

358
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:32,159
location and so you have to remember

359
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,839
remember that this was a temporary

360
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:36,198
solution that was forced on the

361
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:39,480
government by the order in Allard they

362
00:15:36,198 --> 00:15:42,159
had 6 months to come up with something

363
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:46,079
to fix the defects in the

364
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:49,639
mmpr and also remember that the evidence

365
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:52,679
uh in allardt pointed to the defects in

366
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:54,759
the mmpr which led to the patients

367
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:57,318
voting with their feet and going to the

368
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:59,720
dispensaries which led to the surge in

369
00:15:57,318 --> 00:16:02,759
dispensaries which leads the argument

370
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:05,440
that really the dispensaries are lawful

371
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:07,440
in that they're simply filling the void

372
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:10,480
that was created by the

373
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:13,240
mmpr um so it's still a temporary

374
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:15,120
solution we need to know what the

375
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:17,720
problems are that people are having with

376
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:20,759
it because there are going to be more

377
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:23,360
changes the task force on

378
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:26,519
legalization uh there's a whole part of

379
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:31,079
their mandate that deals with medical

380
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:34,519
and so U my view is as we move towards

381
00:16:31,078 --> 00:16:36,159
legalization uh hopefully uh it seems

382
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:39,000
very difficult to get some people to

383
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:41,679
overcome this attitude that they have to

384
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,399
to cannabis at marijuana but hopefully

385
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:46,958
they'll realize that uh they no longer

386
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:49,120
need all this security they no longer

387
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:51,318
need all of these limitations and

388
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:55,159
restrictions that they've imposed simply

389
00:16:51,318 --> 00:16:57,318
because of this somewhat ridiculous fear

390
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:59,958
that uh it's all going to go into the

391
00:16:57,318 --> 00:17:03,038
illicit market and there's you know the

392
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:06,159
the idea in my view is to flood the

393
00:17:03,038 --> 00:17:07,959
market so that uh there's lots of

394
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,959
cannabis around and there's no longer

395
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:13,679
any interest or profit to be made as far

396
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:16,000
as organized crime which they always

397
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:18,519
throw up as being the the people who are

398
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:22,720
out there trying to make a profit out of

399
00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:26,119
it so you hopefully we will transition

400
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:28,400
into a situation where as is apparently

401
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:30,639
happening now in California they're

402
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,919
trying to to ensure that the small

403
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:35,520
producers are protected and are able to

404
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:38,280
participate in the market not just big

405
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:40,079
producers so that all of the people who

406
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:42,839
have leared how to do it well and

407
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:45,639
produce uh good strains will be able to

408
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:48,879
continue and and to to participate on a

409
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:52,038
fair basis with others that the

410
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:55,200
dispensaries will continue to exist in

411
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:57,960
terms of the medical but as a distinct

412
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,600
perhaps group compared to stores that

413
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:03,000
will be able to

414
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:06,879
provide uh legal access to people for

415
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:10,480
social purposes and so my hope and it is

416
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:12,360
a hope but I'm not um i' I've been

417
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,960
around and been involved in this for so

418
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:17,079
long that I am somewhat cynical as to

419
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,159
what will happen once the task force

420
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:21,678
hands this over to the politicians even

421
00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:22,559
though the politicians are saying they

422
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:26,919
will

423
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:29,359
legalize how what form that takes is of

424
00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:31,840
significant concern but

425
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:34,240
hopefully uh they will come to their

426
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:37,038
senses and realize that there's an

427
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:40,120
existing Market with existing suppliers

428
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:42,720
with existing Distributors with existing

429
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:46,000
stores and they will try to Simply

430
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:49,600
regulate them in a fair way as opposed

431
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,640
to trying to change it uh by squeezing

432
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:53,798
this or squeezing that they're just

433
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:57,960
going to create more problems and and

434
00:18:53,798 --> 00:19:00,400
more litigation so as I say they they've

435
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:03,679
created the as perck points out part one

436
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:06,400
of the acmpr is the old mmpr part two is

437
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:09,960
the old mm with a few tweaks it's

438
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:12,440
essentially the same but uh because of

439
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:15,038
the abuses by doctors in

440
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:17,240
particular the colleges across the

441
00:19:15,038 --> 00:19:19,679
country and the Canadian Medical

442
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:23,038
Association and provincial associations

443
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:24,798
have clamped down on the doctors and

444
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:27,200
this has created a problem for those

445
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:30,000
doctors that did have a positive

446
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,440
attitude or new something about Canabis

447
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,919
and they're all fearful that they're

448
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,080
going to be hauled up in front of the

449
00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:38,360
colleges and stuff when really it's the

450
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:41,279
doctors who were charging huge fees uh

451
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:43,158
and who were you know having people just

452
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:45,079
line up and signing for them without

453
00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:47,320
bothering to do anything as far as their

454
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:50,720
medical situation is concerned or I

455
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:53,359
heard even charging on a per plant basis

456
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,440
was the last one that I heard so so you

457
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:57,279
can understand why the colleges have

458
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,279
come in because they see some of their

459
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:01,960
members clearly just you know in a total

460
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:04,399
conflict of interest just doing it in

461
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:08,120
order to make money nothing to do with

462
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:11,480
with uh the medical situation and

463
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:15,000
so the doctor gatekeeper thing I see as

464
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:17,798
as the looming problem which is not a

465
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:21,279
problem necessarily with the acmpr it is

466
00:20:17,798 --> 00:20:23,440
to the extent that we've always said uh

467
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:25,319
doctors of traditional Chinese medicine

468
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:28,759
naturopaths people who know something

469
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:31,918
about real cold plant medicine uh should

470
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:34,200
be involved not just Al apathic medicine

471
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:37,480
types who are used to prescribing a pill

472
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:41,319
and take two of these and mail in the $5

473
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:45,038
type of thing so you know that certainly

474
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:47,960
is a tweak that could be I think part of

475
00:20:45,038 --> 00:20:50,558
a a criticism of the acmpr but the

476
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:54,558
bigger problem is how to get these

477
00:20:50,558 --> 00:20:57,279
colleges to come to their senses and uh

478
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:59,240
to you know get up to date in terms of

479
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:02,399
the the information that's out there

480
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:05,759
about cannabis and its uses for medical

481
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:07,798
purposes in in in particular and so you

482
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:08,640
know we had the M case some years ago

483
00:21:07,798 --> 00:21:11,240
which

484
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,159
unfortunately didn't get through due to

485
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:16,359
a lack of evidence on some of the areas

486
00:21:13,159 --> 00:21:18,880
so we really need to to document the

487
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:21,399
problems people are having because

488
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:24,919
Allard is until further order of the

489
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:26,559
court and so at some point in time

490
00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:29,240
whether it's us or whether it's the

491
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:33,319
government we'll be back in court

492
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:35,960
and we need to know and have evidence to

493
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:38,798
show the court what the problems

494
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:41,919
continue to be so that the court will

495
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:43,440
hopefully not just say okay the acmpr is

496
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,919
the solution what are you complaining

497
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,720
about it's all over so that's why I've

498
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:50,038
been

499
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,839
saying fine if you're protected great

500
00:21:50,038 --> 00:21:54,119
but if you're not protected both

501
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:57,599
protected and unprotected should apply

502
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:59,879
so we can see what the problems are and

503
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:01,759
document them and then we can at least

504
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:03,720
have that body of evidence to produce

505
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:06,960
the Justice feeling when we do have to

506
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:09,360
get back into court I certainly hope

507
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:13,038
that the government legalization model

508
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:15,319
will uh undo huge numbers of these

509
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:18,200
restrictions but I'm troubled when I

510
00:22:15,319 --> 00:22:20,319
hear the chairperson the other day was

511
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:22,159
quoted as saying that young people

512
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:24,599
shouldn't smoke anything because it

513
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:26,799
causes cancer which then I said to

514
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:29,798
myself well you obviously haven't kept

515
00:22:26,798 --> 00:22:31,480
up to date in terms of uh what the

516
00:22:29,798 --> 00:22:34,000
smoking of cannabis and the difference

517
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:36,000
between smoking cannabis and cigarettes

518
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,119
and that there is no evidence of cancer

519
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,480
in fact the opposite that there isn't

520
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:42,519
empyema that it is a bronco dilate or

521
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,480
these sorts of things and that patients

522
00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:47,119
some patients need to smoke it because

523
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,720
they need rapid onset eating it and

524
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:51,918
waiting an hour isn't going to work for

525
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:54,679
them so you know getting them to

526
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:56,240
understand exactly how it works I mean I

527
00:22:54,679 --> 00:22:58,720
I shake my head because I've been

528
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,519
involved in it since the early 70s

529
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,960
people were being sent to jail for

530
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:07,440
simple possession in those days and uh

531
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:10,880
you know so from where I sit things look

532
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:14,159
way better than they used to but we

533
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:17,440
still have these ongoing issues and

534
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:19,480
problems which uh Astound me that they

535
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:22,519
continue to some people to have this

536
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:25,200
sort of attitude but uh the fight isn't

537
00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:29,720
over we still have obviously some

538
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:32,440
looming issues to come and uh

539
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:34,000
again I I think you know our experience

540
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:36,480
with the task force those of us who

541
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,720
appeared in front of it was very good in

542
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,319
terms of being able to provide them with

543
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,440
information and the information seemed

544
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:45,720
to be very well received in terms of all

545
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:48,600
sorts of areas but again you know even

546
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:50,558
if they come up with a good model we

547
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:53,519
have seen even this

548
00:23:50,558 --> 00:23:55,278
government uh have committees not follow

549
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:57,319
the recommendations of the Committees

550
00:23:55,278 --> 00:23:59,038
not follow the recommendations of their

551
00:23:57,319 --> 00:24:03,278
independent Senate

552
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:06,400
so uh I have to say it's a wait and see

553
00:24:03,278 --> 00:24:08,200
a a as to what they recommend and B then

554
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,400
what the politicians do with it

555
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:12,240
afterwards all right so I think we're

556
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,759
going to turn it over to the audience

557
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:18,079
and see if we can get some questions if

558
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:18,079
anybody has anything they want to talk

559
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:27,278
about we'll take this guy here first

560
00:24:28,798 --> 00:24:32,119
thank you guys for coming here and

561
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:34,278
talking today um I just wanted to know

562
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:37,199
uh what kind of legal consequences could

563
00:24:34,278 --> 00:24:39,319
you expect for an unlicensed grower uh

564
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,120
arrested for cultivation if that grower

565
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:43,038
can prove the Cannabis was being sold

566
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:45,959
for medical purposes in a license

567
00:24:43,038 --> 00:24:47,960
dispensary oh wow yeah so that's a

568
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:49,319
sensing law question I could throw

569
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:53,360
something out there and John will tell

570
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:55,359
me where I get it wrong perhaps um but

571
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:57,519
where are you the numberal question is

572
00:24:55,359 --> 00:25:00,278
where are you uh because sentencing

573
00:24:57,519 --> 00:25:02,119
tends to be different in different

574
00:25:00,278 --> 00:25:03,679
provinces all right so you're in British

575
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:05,918
Columbia so there's there's a fairly

576
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:09,038
long line of sentencing Authority in

577
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:10,640
British Columbia imposing very lenient

578
00:25:09,038 --> 00:25:13,558
sentences for producing canvas for

579
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:15,559
medical purposes even if contrary to

580
00:25:13,558 --> 00:25:19,398
existing licensing are outside the

581
00:25:15,558 --> 00:25:21,158
licensing scheme now a lot of that case

582
00:25:19,398 --> 00:25:22,719
law imposed what's called a discharge

583
00:25:21,159 --> 00:25:24,320
which is a finding of guilt and no entry

584
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,880
of criminal conviction that's that's

585
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:28,079
obviously a pretty good result if you

586
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:29,919
get to that point the difficulty is that

587
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:31,759
the conservative government's changes to

588
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:34,200
the control drugs and Substances Act

589
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:37,200
increasing the maximum penalty for

590
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:39,240
production from 7 years to 14 years and

591
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:42,120
imposing mandatory sentencing in some

592
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:44,640
cases uh means that production as an

593
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:46,839
offense is no longer discharge eligible

594
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,399
so you you cannot receive that outcome

595
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:49,918
of guilt but no entry in criminal

596
00:25:48,398 --> 00:25:51,879
conviction if you're if you're found

597
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:53,278
guilty you will be convicted you will

598
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:55,039
have a criminal conviction entered

599
00:25:53,278 --> 00:25:57,480
against you and the penalty is going to

600
00:25:55,038 --> 00:25:58,960
range from at the low end perhaps a

601
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:02,159
suspended sentence

602
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:05,200
or a fine or some kind of probationary

603
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:07,240
disposition uh to at the higher end

604
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,840
potential mandatory minimum sensing

605
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:10,558
legislation based on the number of

606
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:14,000
plants and the presence or the absence

607
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:17,038
of any aggravating factors um those laws

608
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:20,000
those sensing laws have been from time

609
00:26:17,038 --> 00:26:22,558
to time found to be uh

610
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,759
unconstitutional and so it remains to be

611
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:26,639
seen whether they would have any

612
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:28,759
continued Vitality uh going forward but

613
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,360
they they still are on the books

614
00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:31,679
and I don't believe the litigations

615
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:34,158
progress to the point where you could

616
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:36,440
say with confidence that they would not

617
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:39,039
necessarily apply to you and those tend

618
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:40,558
to kick in after six plants between 6

619
00:26:39,038 --> 00:26:42,839
and 200 grown for the purpose of

620
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:44,879
trafficking between 200 and 500 there's

621
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:46,798
another range of penalties and over 500

622
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,440
there's yet another range of potential

623
00:26:46,798 --> 00:26:51,918
man during minimum

624
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:54,960
sentences it used to be that uh what

625
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:57,799
prejudiced you in life was getting a

626
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,840
conviction uh and I've written a paper

627
00:26:57,798 --> 00:27:02,599
on the prejudicial consequences of a

628
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:04,720
non-conviction in Canada where people

629
00:27:02,599 --> 00:27:07,199
get stays of proceedings because the

630
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,159
crown suddenly drops the charge

631
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,278
everybody's happy thinking oh the charge

632
00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:13,399
has been dropped but you'll still have

633
00:27:11,278 --> 00:27:15,398
problems at the border with a stay

634
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:18,038
you'll have problems in other places

635
00:27:15,398 --> 00:27:22,199
with the stay another thing they do is

636
00:27:18,038 --> 00:27:25,480
withdraw the charge and but this digital

637
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:27,200
age I'm afraid has created a situation

638
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:29,880
where whatever is in the digital

639
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:32,399
database some where oh you were seen in

640
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:35,240
a car with somebody who had a joint in

641
00:27:32,398 --> 00:27:37,359
your passenger had a joint 10 years ago

642
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:41,319
and a guy like corpal homequest who was

643
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:43,398
the main witness in in uh Allard who I

644
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:46,359
just spent the last week arguing about

645
00:27:43,398 --> 00:27:48,719
again and another case he's going he's

646
00:27:46,359 --> 00:27:51,798
the guy who goes to these databases and

647
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:55,839
digs it up and causes these problems so

648
00:27:51,798 --> 00:27:58,398
we've got convictions and sentences and

649
00:27:55,839 --> 00:28:00,398
referred to the discharges it was uh

650
00:27:58,398 --> 00:28:02,278
prime minister's father Pierre Trudeau

651
00:28:00,398 --> 00:28:05,319
who introduced absolute and conditional

652
00:28:02,278 --> 00:28:07,919
discharges because of cannabis offenses

653
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:11,240
so to try and reduce the consequences

654
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:12,600
for people of of having a record and you

655
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:14,599
should know that even if you get an

656
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:16,319
absolute discharge the record remains

657
00:28:14,599 --> 00:28:18,038
for a year before they have to take it

658
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:20,599
off and a conditional discharge it

659
00:28:18,038 --> 00:28:23,158
remains for three years and then in more

660
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:25,158
recent times uh because we've always

661
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:27,559
complained about the over incarceration

662
00:28:25,159 --> 00:28:29,200
of people in the country the government

663
00:28:27,558 --> 00:28:31,558
brought in in conditional sentence

664
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,919
orders and a conditional sentence is

665
00:28:31,558 --> 00:28:35,000
quite distinct from a conditional

666
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:37,880
discharge is sort of the last step

667
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:40,720
before actually being sent to prison and

668
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:42,519
so you could have a conditional sentence

669
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,720
where you served your sentence at home

670
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:46,759
or at least in the community subject to

671
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,679
various conditions before conditional

672
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:52,278
sentence orders existed we used to be

673
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:53,840
able to get people probation and period

674
00:28:52,278 --> 00:28:55,798
of maybe a couple of months of house

675
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:57,639
arrest so they could still work support

676
00:28:55,798 --> 00:29:00,679
their families and so on and so for even

677
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:04,799
though was a sanction so I just argued a

678
00:29:00,679 --> 00:29:10,840
case of maybe 6 months ago now called

679
00:29:04,798 --> 00:29:12,319
nearer in Catan where we argued that now

680
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:13,480
with the government having said it's

681
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:17,200
going to

682
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:19,679
legalize so what is the crown supposed

683
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:22,640
to do what is the defense supposed to do

684
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:25,240
what's the judge supposed to do in

685
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:28,640
sentencing the principles of sentencing

686
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:31,319
that one looks at a major one is to deny

687
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:34,440
the conduct and so we said to the judge

688
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:36,960
in saskatch well uh the government here

689
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:39,120
is on one hand saying give this guy 15

690
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,079
to 19 months it was a trafficking

691
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:41,839
possession for the purpose of

692
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:44,398
trafficking case about

693
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:47,599
30 and on the other hand the government

694
00:29:44,398 --> 00:29:51,079
saying we're going to legalize so uh you

695
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:53,319
know denounce denounce conduct that you

696
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:55,678
say you're going to legalize another

697
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:58,558
sentencing principle is to deter others

698
00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:01,159
who are likeminded again

699
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:03,440
you know you're going to legalize so

700
00:30:01,159 --> 00:30:06,039
people are going to do it so you know

701
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:07,840
what what's going on here I mean the

702
00:30:06,038 --> 00:30:09,960
other ones are are you reformed and

703
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:11,798
rehabilitated well usually it's a year

704
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:14,679
later and the person has usually managed

705
00:30:11,798 --> 00:30:16,440
to do all sorts of things to appear at

706
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:18,360
least to be reformed

707
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:21,798
rehabilitated and the other one is

708
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:25,119
specific dets so so we said look you

709
00:30:21,798 --> 00:30:28,398
know J the crown here wants 15 to 19

710
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:30,239
months uh and they've taken away the

711
00:30:28,398 --> 00:30:32,398
conservatives took away the ability to

712
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:35,038
impose conditional sentence orders and

713
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:36,759
here was a classic fellow who would have

714
00:30:35,038 --> 00:30:39,480
got a conditional sentence order if they

715
00:30:36,759 --> 00:30:43,079
still existed and didn't need to be sent

716
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:46,159
actually into prison and to my surprise

717
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:49,599
the judge accepted that argument and he

718
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:52,320
said we are in an interregnum period

719
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:56,240
between Kings between

720
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:59,759
C and he gave him probation with a

721
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:02,480
couple of months of house arrest and uh

722
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:05,398
some other ancillary orders you know

723
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:08,278
Firearms etc etc and the government has

724
00:31:05,398 --> 00:31:10,398
appealed that uh so they run the risk of

725
00:31:08,278 --> 00:31:12,159
the Saskatchewan court of appeal

726
00:31:10,398 --> 00:31:13,719
hopefully accepting the position I just

727
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:15,159
heard the other day they want us to be

728
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:17,639
there November 10th but I think it's

729
00:31:15,159 --> 00:31:20,200
more likely to be at the end of November

730
00:31:17,638 --> 00:31:23,638
but I also heard U other Council have

731
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:26,038
succeeded in a dial of dope uh case to

732
00:31:23,638 --> 00:31:31,240
get a conditional discharge for somebody

733
00:31:26,038 --> 00:31:34,919
based on was it J yeah maybe it

734
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:37,720
was no no that's this is a recent

735
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:39,679
sentencing in British Columbia so we're

736
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:41,880
encouraging other lawyers and then

737
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:44,679
certainly people who are facing these

738
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:47,799
sorts of issues to get their lawyers to

739
00:31:44,679 --> 00:31:51,240
make that same argument and rely on Neri

740
00:31:47,798 --> 00:31:53,000
to point out this problem and I you know

741
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:55,000
you you criticize some of the crown

742
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,638
counsil I've known some of the people in

743
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,720
the federal department of justice for a

744
00:31:56,638 --> 00:32:01,119
long period of time and they're quite

745
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:03,319
candid some of them with me not all of

746
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:04,839
them but some of them uh about how

747
00:32:03,319 --> 00:32:06,839
they're in this awkward position you

748
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:09,480
know what are we supposed to do we're s

749
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:12,119
of getting conflicting positions here in

750
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:13,639
terms of what we're we're supposed to do

751
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:16,678
and of course as Kirk mentioned

752
00:32:13,638 --> 00:32:18,158
mandatory minimums it's ridiculous that

753
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:20,080
they've brought in these mandatory

754
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:22,159
minimums and and it's ridiculous that

755
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:23,879
this government hasn't moved to get rid

756
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:25,880
of them you know that should have

757
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:28,600
happened by now and yet we're still

758
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:30,519
forced into situations

759
00:32:28,599 --> 00:32:33,798
where we have to make these arguments

760
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:36,359
I've got a a guy next week who he he was

761
00:32:33,798 --> 00:32:38,158
a guy who went and watered plants to

762
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:40,479
make a little extra money he wasn't

763
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:44,159
involved in any other aspects of this

764
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:45,919
grow operation uh he wasn't he wasn't

765
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:48,080
benefiting in any other way from it

766
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:50,278
other than being paid and he's the only

767
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:52,199
one charged because they screwed up in

768
00:32:50,278 --> 00:32:54,359
relation to the main people and all the

769
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:58,080
rest of it and they're running three

770
00:32:54,359 --> 00:33:01,038
years mandatory minimum for this fellow

771
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:02,759
and so you say you know okay so we're

772
00:33:01,038 --> 00:33:04,519
going to have another challenge to the

773
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:06,240
mandatory minimum we're going to have

774
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:07,720
another challenge to the fact that they

775
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,359
took away the conditional sentence

776
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:12,079
orders and it's going to wind its way

777
00:33:10,359 --> 00:33:14,000
these cases are going to wind their way

778
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:16,359
up through the courts and come the

779
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,960
spring they're supposed to legalize or

780
00:33:16,359 --> 00:33:21,359
start the process so what are the judges

781
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:23,960
supposed to do you know they're sitting

782
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:26,519
there saying wait a minute you know this

783
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:28,639
doesn't make sense so there's a real

784
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:30,679
problem and we really need to somehow

785
00:33:28,638 --> 00:33:33,599
get the current federal liberal

786
00:33:30,679 --> 00:33:37,320
government to move quicker or move

787
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:40,558
faster and get this sorted out so that

788
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:43,278
we can put this behind us and uh move

789
00:33:40,558 --> 00:33:45,200
forward better take some more questions

790
00:33:43,278 --> 00:33:48,759
let's hear

791
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:50,679
from okay um hold close your okay first

792
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:54,319
of all I'd like to agree with your point

793
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:56,000
that um doctors are an issue um doctors

794
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:58,119
are not available in a lot of the

795
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,839
province I mean people don't have doctor

796
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:02,398
you can't get access to a doctor I mean

797
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:03,959
many people can so it's really an issue

798
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:06,599
I mean in Vancouver there's lots of

799
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:07,880
doctors but out in the country it's hard

800
00:34:06,599 --> 00:34:11,759
okay they're just simply not available

801
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:14,559
so that's a real barrier okay and um

802
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:17,440
secondly you know the license producers

803
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:20,440
in in the old mm regime they're getting

804
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:22,280
forced out because they can't afford the

805
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:24,599
the access barriers now that are in

806
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:26,240
place okay so we're changing the whole

807
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:27,879
base of the industry into these great

808
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:29,519
big players that are squishing out

809
00:34:27,878 --> 00:34:31,319
little guys that actually formed the

810
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:34,119
industry and have been on the front

811
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:36,838
lines fighting all the way okay so it's

812
00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:38,240
it's really not right and secondly um I

813
00:34:36,838 --> 00:34:40,878
just like to point I finally did get

814
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:43,358
access to a temporary doctor I managed

815
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:46,398
to get I applied for and got my U

816
00:34:43,358 --> 00:34:48,639
medical grow okay and um you were

817
00:34:46,398 --> 00:34:51,358
mentioning and I also saw on the website

818
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:52,320
that it's supposed to be um two plants

819
00:34:51,358 --> 00:34:55,759
per

820
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:58,680
gram an outdoor license is approximately

821
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:01,760
two plants per gram per day right well

822
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:05,199
they're issuing under the old uh amount

823
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:09,560
still so I got issued one plant program

824
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:12,399
outside and 3.7 for inside so oh you

825
00:35:09,559 --> 00:35:15,239
went with a with a split license indoor

826
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:17,240
outdoor so there is a different formula

827
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:19,559
for there is an indoor outdoor license

828
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:21,439
you can only grow indoors or Outdoors at

829
00:35:19,559 --> 00:35:23,239
any one time but the formula is

830
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,320
different if you apply for that

831
00:35:23,239 --> 00:35:26,759
licensing uh because the assumption is

832
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:29,119
that you're going to grow indoors during

833
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:30,520
the indoor cycle and Outdoors during the

834
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:32,440
outdoor cycle and they sort of think

835
00:35:30,519 --> 00:35:35,719
you'll you'll produce x amount of

836
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:38,000
cannabis as a result of those two three

837
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:39,919
Cycles a year that's one of the things

838
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,679
that's carried forward in the acmpr you

839
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,079
can only grow indoors or outdoors and

840
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:45,440
does that make sense I mean I would

841
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:47,240
think people would start indoors try to

842
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:49,079
get them Outdoors when you get some good

843
00:35:47,239 --> 00:35:50,959
weather to reduce your hydro cost and

844
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:54,318
bring them back in before the Bold sets

845
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,318
in you know

846
00:35:56,449 --> 00:35:59,519
[Applause]

847
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:02,240
so you know there continue to be these

848
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:05,039
issues there's no doubt the ACM and and

849
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:06,358
you know to be fair you can't reg no

850
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:08,800
regulatory scheme is going to capture

851
00:36:06,358 --> 00:36:10,039
every potential factual situation but

852
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,240
but that's why the scheme ought to have

853
00:36:10,039 --> 00:36:14,079
some more flexibility than that and at

854
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:16,078
the end of the day any plant number is

855
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:18,119
pretty arbitrary isn't it what does it

856
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:21,318
what does it matter I mean why why

857
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:23,720
should you have to grow four big plants

858
00:36:21,318 --> 00:36:25,719
instead of 40 really small plants maybe

859
00:36:23,719 --> 00:36:27,000
that's your preferred growing method at

860
00:36:25,719 --> 00:36:29,439
the end of the day the question ought to

861
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,920
be are you uh growing that for

862
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,358
commercial purposes in which case

863
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:34,039
there's a different system for you to be

864
00:36:32,358 --> 00:36:36,799
part of or are you growing it for your

865
00:36:34,039 --> 00:36:38,679
yourself or permision to caregiver um

866
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:42,240
then then it's a different ball game

867
00:36:38,679 --> 00:36:44,759
entirely what most people Overlook is

868
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:48,159
because it's been a criminal issue but

869
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:50,400
now we're looking at product liability

870
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:52,358
when I hear for the old mm Growers that

871
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:55,039
say but I had a right to grow in like

872
00:36:52,358 --> 00:36:58,119
solid people under M it's like no you

873
00:36:55,039 --> 00:37:00,318
didn't you had the ability to grow for

874
00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:03,079
yourself and grow for someone else and

875
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:05,440
that's it but when you then give that

876
00:37:03,079 --> 00:37:07,960
product or sell that product in a

877
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:09,599
commercial retail like setting there's a

878
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:11,240
whole bunch of other rules I mean for

879
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:14,000
any of the lawyers in the room you only

880
00:37:11,239 --> 00:37:16,239
have to look at Don ATU and Stevenson

881
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,239
which was a case of a snail in a bottle

882
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:22,159
of ginger beer in England about 100

883
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:24,639
years ago which essentially means that

884
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:27,679
you have a duty of care that is owed to

885
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:30,400
the ultimate consumer so if you're

886
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:32,639
selling or producing a prod a product

887
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:35,039
and then that goes to the dispensary and

888
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:37,679
then the dispensary sells it on to

889
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:40,519
somebody well you then have to ensure

890
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:42,598
that that that product and you meet the

891
00:37:40,519 --> 00:37:45,079
duty of care to the ultimate consumer

892
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:47,559
and so really until we figure out

893
00:37:45,079 --> 00:37:49,960
definitively how are we going to get can

894
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:52,759
cannabis by the mail dispensary liquor

895
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:56,318
store um that's really going to

896
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:59,119
determine a lot on that do we have

897
00:37:56,318 --> 00:38:01,759
another question

898
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:04,800
yeah I think we need a few good lawyers

899
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:07,119
by the sounds of it who are these people

900
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:09,160
are we not free I mean who gets to tell

901
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:11,400
you how many plants you can have and you

902
00:38:09,159 --> 00:38:13,279
know why why is cannabis treated hard

903
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:15,358
more harshly than tomatoes or potatoes

904
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,800
and all that stuff um we've actually

905
00:38:15,358 --> 00:38:18,440
known for a long time that they're full

906
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,280
of that they lied their through

907
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:22,159
their teeth about this that the Cannabis

908
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:24,839
was never a dangerous strug it was only

909
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:26,759
ever a threat to corporations and people

910
00:38:24,838 --> 00:38:29,279
that wanted to sell you their stuff and

911
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:31,800
so the whole thing is is a huge scam and

912
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,839
it's a huge crime against us and it's

913
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:35,079
continuing and there should be some

914
00:38:33,838 --> 00:38:36,519
repercussions for these people they

915
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:38,119
shouldn't be able to just get into the

916
00:38:36,519 --> 00:38:40,800
business of now selling us weed after

917
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:42,838
they spent their lives penalizing people

918
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:45,119
for it uh we need some lawyers to go

919
00:38:42,838 --> 00:38:47,969
after these people they should be held

920
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:50,960
to the fire it's a huge huge time

921
00:38:47,969 --> 00:38:53,199
[Applause]

922
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,800
that's you're obviously preaching the

923
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:58,919
choir at this

924
00:38:54,800 --> 00:39:00,599
conference we can't keep up with

925
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:03,480
I would say on the on the question of

926
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:05,760
you know should lawyers go after people

927
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:07,639
that are legislators that then get into

928
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,200
the Cannabis industry I mean you know in

929
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:11,000
law you have to have causes of action

930
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:13,118
you have to have base seats for lawsuits

931
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,800
you can't just sue people because you

932
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:16,400
think they're bad people or did bad

933
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,440
things they've hurt a lot of people and

934
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,960
they've known for a long time in law you

935
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:23,358
need a cause of action to sue someone

936
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:26,280
and it is not to my knowledge a cause of

937
00:39:23,358 --> 00:39:28,440
action to be wrong in legislative policy

938
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:29,920
change your mind vote for something new

939
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:31,838
and then later become part of that

940
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:33,760
industry there's that's not a cause of

941
00:39:31,838 --> 00:39:35,078
action that's just what happens I'm not

942
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,720
saying prosecutive for the ones getting

943
00:39:35,079 --> 00:39:38,200
into the Cannabis industry I'm saying

944
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:39,879
the ones that maintained these

945
00:39:38,199 --> 00:39:41,559
prohibitions knowing that they were

946
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:43,720
wrong and in violation of free people

947
00:39:41,559 --> 00:39:44,480
and hurting people they that's a huge

948
00:39:43,719 --> 00:39:47,318
huge

949
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:49,960
crime agree that it's politically UNR

950
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:52,559
morally reprehensible but I don't see a

951
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:56,389
legal cause of action how do you stop

952
00:39:52,559 --> 00:40:01,090
people supporting Donald Trump

953
00:39:56,389 --> 00:40:01,089
[Applause]

954
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:05,879
you elective that'll teach him well I

955
00:40:03,358 --> 00:40:07,440
mean your power comes in BX that's where

956
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:10,240
you exercise power over political

957
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:12,400
officials at the B they get away with it

958
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:13,959
yeah have another question next question

959
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:16,760
my quick answer to you is I think

960
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:18,880
education um how we help Donald Trump

961
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:21,000
supporters their education I think will

962
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:23,039
make some better decisions but um I have

963
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,119
two questions completely unrelated but

964
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:28,119
maybe sort of related um my first

965
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:29,920
question is um just wasting more of what

966
00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:31,440
jod was asking yesterday what is going

967
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,559
to happen to the people who have already

968
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:35,838
been wrongfully incarcerated for using

969
00:40:33,559 --> 00:40:37,440
cannabis simple possession once

970
00:40:35,838 --> 00:40:39,599
legalization comes about are those

971
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:41,119
people are going to be remaining in jail

972
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:43,838
what's going to happen with their

973
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:46,039
process um my second question as

974
00:40:43,838 --> 00:40:48,039
actually just more to what you were

975
00:40:46,039 --> 00:40:49,880
mentioning a lot of people in rural

976
00:40:48,039 --> 00:40:52,199
communities don't have access to doctors

977
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:53,920
that are on board that um choose not to

978
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:57,799
educate themselves and I know that

979
00:40:53,920 --> 00:41:00,639
that's very frustrating um

980
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:03,119
wondering isn't that doing harm by

981
00:41:00,639 --> 00:41:05,039
choosing to remain ignorant to something

982
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:07,599
that has a lot of theil right on the

983
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:10,039
head well really but it's philosophical

984
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:12,640
but it's also legal like I so those are

985
00:41:10,039 --> 00:41:14,519
my two questions sure why don't we uh

986
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:18,960
John you've had many more clients

987
00:41:14,519 --> 00:41:18,960
wrongfully incarcerated than I have

988
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:27,800
um John is actually an expert on Prison

989
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:29,400
reforms that's a great question is he's

990
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,760
he's an expert on Prison policy been

991
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:32,318
fighting for the rights of prisoners

992
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:35,560
just as long as the rights of canis

993
00:41:32,318 --> 00:41:38,358
consumers so so what does

994
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:40,559
happen what can and does happen uh when

995
00:41:38,358 --> 00:41:42,519
we legalize candidates all the victims

996
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:45,559
well you know my hope and expectation

997
00:41:42,519 --> 00:41:48,800
would be that we will have a government

998
00:41:45,559 --> 00:41:51,559
commuting providing amnesty or you know

999
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:53,960
these remission these sorts of things we

1000
00:41:51,559 --> 00:41:56,000
do have a process for getting Royal

1001
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:57,838
prerogatives of mercy and pardons and

1002
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,960
these sorts of things so I would expect

1003
00:41:57,838 --> 00:42:04,039
that there will be some movement to try

1004
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:09,000
and and decarcerate people who are in in

1005
00:42:04,039 --> 00:42:11,440
that situation I mean my uh position is

1006
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:14,358
broader than just cannabis I don't think

1007
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:16,280
that drug use of any kind should be

1008
00:42:14,358 --> 00:42:18,679
subjected to the criminal law it's a

1009
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,680
health

1010
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:28,920
issue with trying to control people's

1011
00:42:25,159 --> 00:42:32,159
use and providing a black market for

1012
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:35,760
organized crime essentially uh it's just

1013
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:37,558
absolutely stupid yeah um but in terms

1014
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:39,559
of your other question I mean I think

1015
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:42,680
again the digital age hopefully will

1016
00:42:39,559 --> 00:42:46,000
enable people by Skype and other sorts

1017
00:42:42,679 --> 00:42:49,199
of ways to be able to access doctors

1018
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,800
remotely uh in order to deal with that

1019
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:53,598
problem I know that some doctors are

1020
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:55,480
doing that again the college sometimes

1021
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:56,838
raises issues with them doing that if

1022
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:59,079
they're in different provinces and

1023
00:42:56,838 --> 00:43:01,239
things like that but surely that's the

1024
00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:03,039
obvious solution is if you're in a

1025
00:43:01,239 --> 00:43:05,039
remote community and you don't have a

1026
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:08,199
doctor and you're entitled to reasonable

1027
00:43:05,039 --> 00:43:10,079
access uh the doctors who understand the

1028
00:43:08,199 --> 00:43:12,558
issue and who are supportive should be

1029
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:14,440
able you should be able to access them

1030
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:18,000
online

1031
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:20,599
and you legal action those doctors who

1032
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:23,280
choose not to educate themselves or the

1033
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:26,599
college well I was going to throw that

1034
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:27,960
to Rob is there in your view a cause of

1035
00:43:26,599 --> 00:43:30,280
action against against an individual

1036
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:32,639
doctor or a college for its prescribing

1037
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:35,880
or or prescription type policies or

1038
00:43:32,639 --> 00:43:39,639
refusals to do assist patients well

1039
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:41,838
there's definitely a cause of action the

1040
00:43:39,639 --> 00:43:43,679
question is finding a cause of action

1041
00:43:41,838 --> 00:43:45,719
that the courts will take serious now

1042
00:43:43,679 --> 00:43:47,318
one of the big difficulties is when you

1043
00:43:45,719 --> 00:43:49,519
go up against a

1044
00:43:47,318 --> 00:43:54,440
regulator which has

1045
00:43:49,519 --> 00:43:57,559
had um what it Authority delegated or

1046
00:43:54,440 --> 00:44:00,039
power delegated to them by um the

1047
00:43:57,559 --> 00:44:02,800
government and there's an expectation

1048
00:44:00,039 --> 00:44:06,279
that well the government entrusted the

1049
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:09,400
college with power to essentially make

1050
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:12,200
mistakes I mean their job is to try to

1051
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:14,960
regulate policy the best as they can and

1052
00:44:12,199 --> 00:44:16,719
although look I'll be Devil's Advocate

1053
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:18,280
they may not get it right all the time

1054
00:44:16,719 --> 00:44:21,879
they get it right

1055
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:24,760
sometime and unfortunately that's really

1056
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:26,880
how things evolve and get better I think

1057
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:29,079
the answer that you need to be looking

1058
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:31,920
at is instead of like well I need to

1059
00:44:29,079 --> 00:44:33,760
deal with the college I need to you know

1060
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:36,440
fight all these battles I think the

1061
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:40,040
better way to look at it is you know did

1062
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:42,800
women wait around to get the vote no

1063
00:44:40,039 --> 00:44:45,599
they engaged in Civil Disobedience until

1064
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:47,359
the laws and the rules change what's so

1065
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:49,000
fascinating about you know we saw an

1066
00:44:47,358 --> 00:44:53,239
Allard they didn't really address the

1067
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:57,079
issue of dispensaries but despite the uh

1068
00:44:53,239 --> 00:44:59,239
intense enforcement in Ontario and the

1069
00:44:57,079 --> 00:45:03,119
lack of enforcement in British Columbia

1070
00:44:59,239 --> 00:45:05,199
creates this patch quilt scenario where

1071
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:06,880
the difficulty I see it I mean we had

1072
00:45:05,199 --> 00:45:09,000
brandan Kennedy this morning and it's

1073
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:11,440
all very impressive but this is a race

1074
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,000
to the bottom ladies and gentlemen folks

1075
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,440
have been growing and engaging in

1076
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
cannabis and some of our clients been

1077
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:17,280
doing this for 40 years and I'm

1078
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,079
confident tomorrow they're going to wake

1079
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:21,720
up and continue to do what they're doing

1080
00:45:19,079 --> 00:45:23,400
regardless right and so really these are

1081
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:25,719
who the corporate and I work I have a

1082
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:27,599
Wall Street background I worked in L

1083
00:45:25,719 --> 00:45:30,199
London city of London

1084
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:32,920
and New York with the cia's law firm on

1085
00:45:30,199 --> 00:45:35,519
Wall Street and all of this really is

1086
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:39,039
ladies and gentlemen is designed to be a

1087
00:45:35,519 --> 00:45:41,759
most trap to essentially work for the

1088
00:45:39,039 --> 00:45:44,239
people that Lobby and uh you know put

1089
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:46,400
policy for the system so every day that

1090
00:45:44,239 --> 00:45:49,239
you go to a dispensary and make that

1091
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:51,599
decision to shop there or to inform

1092
00:45:49,239 --> 00:45:53,358
yourself and educate yourself and make

1093
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:55,519
the decision that if cannabis is right

1094
00:45:53,358 --> 00:45:57,440
for you that's a decision that you need

1095
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:59,759
to make and so

1096
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:02,280
thank you you can wait for the

1097
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:04,599
government to get it right and actually

1098
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:06,440
I'll use an analogy as they say in Texas

1099
00:46:04,599 --> 00:46:09,559
you can wish in one hand in the

1100
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:11,480
other and see what fills up first so I

1101
00:46:09,559 --> 00:46:13,760
think the question is is the government

1102
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:15,679
may or may not get it right well show

1103
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:17,960
them how they should do it and so that's

1104
00:46:15,679 --> 00:46:20,399
where I think the future really is civil

1105
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:22,318
disobedience and social engagement

1106
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:24,519
because it's the communities that are

1107
00:46:22,318 --> 00:46:26,480
making the changes and the monies are

1108
00:46:24,519 --> 00:46:29,199
flowing up the Grassroots back into the

1109
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:31,199
community not to Ottawa let me just

1110
00:46:29,199 --> 00:46:34,118
speak to the issue you you said in terms

1111
00:46:31,199 --> 00:46:36,719
of the doctors and the colleges I me

1112
00:46:34,119 --> 00:46:38,358
again the colleges are doing the right

1113
00:46:36,719 --> 00:46:40,439
thing in my view and trying to clamp

1114
00:46:38,358 --> 00:46:43,639
down on the doctors that are abusing the

1115
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:46,119
system but it's having this impact in

1116
00:46:43,639 --> 00:46:47,920
affecting reasonable access and so I

1117
00:46:46,119 --> 00:46:50,440
think in the short term we need to get

1118
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:53,119
the doctors there is a group The

1119
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:55,200
practitioners for uh cannabis medicine I

1120
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:57,318
think it's if I'm getting the name right

1121
00:46:55,199 --> 00:46:59,639
but there a a group of doctors across

1122
00:46:57,318 --> 00:47:02,239
Canada who are fully supportive and

1123
00:46:59,639 --> 00:47:06,279
knowledgeable about cannabis these folks

1124
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:08,838
have to be the ones going after the

1125
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:11,160
heads of their colleges and and and

1126
00:47:08,838 --> 00:47:13,239
being the ones to try and bring them you

1127
00:47:11,159 --> 00:47:15,719
know educate them and so on just like we

1128
00:47:13,239 --> 00:47:18,959
lawyers if it's the Law Society or the

1129
00:47:15,719 --> 00:47:20,519
Canadian bar we need to be the ones who

1130
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:22,240
go there to do it rather than just

1131
00:47:20,519 --> 00:47:25,400
thinking you can start a court case and

1132
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:27,799
somehow that will uh will uh sort the

1133
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:29,318
problem up let me just for a quick story

1134
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:32,440
for you though because Rob mentioned

1135
00:47:29,318 --> 00:47:36,800
women on the right to vote uh you got to

1136
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:40,318
remember that uh it was uh uh one of the

1137
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:42,480
famous five who wrote the Black Candle

1138
00:47:40,318 --> 00:47:45,558
and uh it was the Black Candle that was

1139
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:47,519
serialized in uh in McLean's magazine

1140
00:47:45,559 --> 00:47:53,680
across Canada that was based on all the

1141
00:47:47,519 --> 00:47:56,318
stories in the US that uh led to uh 1923

1142
00:47:53,679 --> 00:48:00,118
cannabis being put in the schedule to

1143
00:47:56,318 --> 00:48:03,558
then opum narcotic act following on what

1144
00:48:00,119 --> 00:48:05,838
we did here in Vancouver when we had uh

1145
00:48:03,559 --> 00:48:08,920
all the Chinese who came and built the

1146
00:48:05,838 --> 00:48:10,838
railroads and were our best workers and

1147
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:13,240
many of them were killed doing so and we

1148
00:48:10,838 --> 00:48:15,400
had opium dens they brought the Opium

1149
00:48:13,239 --> 00:48:18,199
with them from China after the Opium

1150
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:19,880
Wars and so on we had opium dens all

1151
00:48:18,199 --> 00:48:22,000
over Vancouver Victoria and New

1152
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:26,440
Westminster more than the

1153
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:29,199
dispensaries and uh it was a Labor uh

1154
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:31,119
situ situation that led to them uh

1155
00:48:29,199 --> 00:48:32,558
kicking shutting them down and kicking

1156
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:34,440
them out if you go to the Dominion

1157
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:37,079
annual statistics you'll see China and

1158
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:39,240
deported possession of opium product and

1159
00:48:37,079 --> 00:48:42,599
so when you look into the history of

1160
00:48:39,239 --> 00:48:45,199
drug prohibition it all goes back to

1161
00:48:42,599 --> 00:48:47,720
that the Chinese in terms of opium the

1162
00:48:45,199 --> 00:48:49,919
black people in terms of cocaine it was

1163
00:48:47,719 --> 00:48:52,199
the Mexicans in terms of cannabis

1164
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:54,200
starting in I think Utah with the

1165
00:48:52,199 --> 00:48:56,960
Mormons and then spreading across the

1166
00:48:54,199 --> 00:49:00,118
United States so you know these sorts of

1167
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:02,559
things still happen where this people

1168
00:49:00,119 --> 00:49:05,760
say we're losing our jobs they blame

1169
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:09,400
people of color and these sorts of

1170
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:12,559
situations develop so we have to try and

1171
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:15,358
All Rise Above these sorts of things and

1172
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:17,160
try to educate people reason if I can

1173
00:49:15,358 --> 00:49:19,318
make an observation before we get to

1174
00:49:17,159 --> 00:49:20,480
another question a lot of people say

1175
00:49:19,318 --> 00:49:22,838
well what's going to happen what's going

1176
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:25,880
to happen and well let's look at another

1177
00:49:22,838 --> 00:49:28,719
simple example in Vancouver so history

1178
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:30,400
repeats itself uh the pentos nightclub

1179
00:49:28,719 --> 00:49:35,000
and the Commodore Ballroom got their

1180
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:37,000
licenses 1969 and 1971 respectively so

1181
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:40,679
what was happening during the 40s the

1182
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:44,280
50s the 60s and then you know early 70s

1183
00:49:40,679 --> 00:49:46,358
well they remained open and uh they you

1184
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:49,720
know I think really the key is is if you

1185
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:53,400
survive and stay open you will in 20 30

1186
00:49:49,719 --> 00:49:56,719
years get a history um commemoration CLA

1187
00:49:53,400 --> 00:50:00,200
from theal government so I think really

1188
00:49:56,719 --> 00:50:00,199
just think of the words of Fel

1189
00:50:00,719 --> 00:50:05,519
Castro condemn me it's not important

1190
00:50:03,239 --> 00:50:06,838
history will absolve me and I think

1191
00:50:05,519 --> 00:50:10,679
that's what's going to happen in this

1192
00:50:06,838 --> 00:50:10,679
market so I think we have time

1193
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:17,079
for might about it but I'm sure they'd

1194
00:50:14,318 --> 00:50:19,480
love to talk to you the hallway I got a

1195
00:50:17,079 --> 00:50:20,920
a question here I wanted to ask you

1196
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:22,838
people keep telling us oh it's going to

1197
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:24,880
be legal in the spring you're just

1198
00:50:22,838 --> 00:50:26,838
impatient once it's legalized in the

1199
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:28,440
spring I don't feel it's going to be

1200
00:50:26,838 --> 00:50:30,078
legal in the spring and and I would

1201
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:31,798
expect people to still be charged for

1202
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:34,480
possession all through

1203
00:50:31,798 --> 00:50:37,079
2017 I'm curious as to what you feel

1204
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:39,480
about the timeline for the federal and

1205
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:40,720
provincial and Municipal legalization if

1206
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:42,159
I if you think I'm right there will

1207
00:50:40,719 --> 00:50:44,679
still be possession arrest and

1208
00:50:42,159 --> 00:50:46,078
enforcement all of next year and what

1209
00:50:44,679 --> 00:50:47,759
what you should anticipate as the

1210
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:49,079
timeline over the next year or two and

1211
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:51,559
when we're actually going to be able to

1212
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:54,240
buy some kind of government approved

1213
00:50:51,559 --> 00:50:56,519
cannabis with Justin Trudeau's stamp on

1214
00:50:54,239 --> 00:50:57,279
it in a store at some point or going to

1215
00:50:56,519 --> 00:50:59,079
have

1216
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:01,680
so so I think we may have different

1217
00:50:59,079 --> 00:51:03,798
views on this I I uh gave my view

1218
00:51:01,679 --> 00:51:05,480
earlier today in an earlier panel I'll

1219
00:51:03,798 --> 00:51:06,960
just repeat that briefly and then I'll

1220
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:09,039
I'll flip it over to these other

1221
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:11,639
gentlemen to sort of look into their

1222
00:51:09,039 --> 00:51:14,279
murky crystal balls but you know the

1223
00:51:11,639 --> 00:51:15,519
timeline that we know is that next month

1224
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:17,280
the task force going to make its

1225
00:51:15,519 --> 00:51:21,000
recommendation to Bill Blair Bill Blair

1226
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:23,119
will then regurgitate and and that up to

1227
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:26,000
uh his bosses Ministers of Justice

1228
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:28,920
health and Public Safety uh with his own

1229
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:31,119
commentary added into it uh they they've

1230
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:32,760
told us that that's the timeline the

1231
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:35,318
government has promised to introduce

1232
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:37,000
legislation in the spring of 2017 spring

1233
00:51:35,318 --> 00:51:38,000
session of parliament lasted about mid

1234
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,760
June

1235
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,719
2017 uh I would expect if legislation is

1236
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:45,319
introduced at first reading in the

1237
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:48,358
spring 2017 it we don't get through

1238
00:51:45,318 --> 00:51:50,000
third reading uh in that spring session

1239
00:51:48,358 --> 00:51:52,880
so I expect the whole thing's over till

1240
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:55,440
the fall session of 2017 I expect there

1241
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:56,720
will be extensive committee hearings uh

1242
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:58,838
because despite the fact that the

1243
00:51:56,719 --> 00:52:00,199
government has said it's not about

1244
00:51:58,838 --> 00:52:02,199
whether we're going to do it it's how

1245
00:52:00,199 --> 00:52:04,239
we're going to do it they they know the

1246
00:52:02,199 --> 00:52:06,399
eyes of the world are abond Canada

1247
00:52:04,239 --> 00:52:07,798
they've said that repeatedly everybody's

1248
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:09,920
going to want to have their piece of the

1249
00:52:07,798 --> 00:52:12,798
action and piece of the publicity in

1250
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:14,440
Ottawa so you know I think that that

1251
00:52:12,798 --> 00:52:18,880
could drag on through the remainder of

1252
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:20,720
2017 then the bill goes to the um senate

1253
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:22,680
for review they do committee hearings

1254
00:52:20,719 --> 00:52:24,118
they look at it some more and then it

1255
00:52:22,679 --> 00:52:26,558
goes back to the house and if it goes

1256
00:52:24,119 --> 00:52:29,039
back change the house has to start of

1257
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:32,559
then either adopt those changes or try

1258
00:52:29,039 --> 00:52:35,119
to override them you know my own guess

1259
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:38,200
is that we we we don't have legislative

1260
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:39,720
change until early 2018 that legislative

1261
00:52:38,199 --> 00:52:41,239
change is also going to require each

1262
00:52:39,719 --> 00:52:43,558
province and territory in this country

1263
00:52:41,239 --> 00:52:46,118
to participate and to have a

1264
00:52:43,559 --> 00:52:47,720
distribution plan ready because the feds

1265
00:52:46,119 --> 00:52:49,160
have signal they're going to retain

1266
00:52:47,719 --> 00:52:51,078
jurisdiction over manufacturing

1267
00:52:49,159 --> 00:52:52,759
production the provinces are going to

1268
00:52:51,079 --> 00:52:55,798
deal and territories are going to deal

1269
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:57,799
with uh the distribution piece so you

1270
00:52:55,798 --> 00:53:01,639
know I I think we're a long ways out

1271
00:52:57,798 --> 00:53:04,239
from buying legal cannabis in a store uh

1272
00:53:01,639 --> 00:53:06,199
whatever that store might look like uh

1273
00:53:04,239 --> 00:53:08,078
and and you're right I mean the tragedy

1274
00:53:06,199 --> 00:53:10,798
of this all is that people continue to

1275
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:13,920
be arrested for violating these laws and

1276
00:53:10,798 --> 00:53:16,519
I got to tell you it it doesn't have to

1277
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:18,838
be that way the the public prosecution

1278
00:53:16,519 --> 00:53:21,199
service of Canada before filing charges

1279
00:53:18,838 --> 00:53:22,719
against individuals in British Columbia

1280
00:53:21,199 --> 00:53:24,719
have to determine whether filing those

1281
00:53:22,719 --> 00:53:26,078
charges is in the public interest and

1282
00:53:24,719 --> 00:53:28,598
whether there's a substantial likelihood

1283
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:31,359
of conviction not discharge conviction

1284
00:53:28,599 --> 00:53:33,359
if you file the charges you could stop

1285
00:53:31,358 --> 00:53:35,960
Prosecuting simple possession offenses

1286
00:53:33,358 --> 00:53:40,400
in this country as a matter of policy

1287
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:42,159
and prosecutorial discretion today and

1288
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:44,318
the reason it hasn't happened is because

1289
00:53:42,159 --> 00:53:47,279
the political pressure has not yet been

1290
00:53:44,318 --> 00:53:49,960
applied sufficient to make them liberals

1291
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:52,040
believe that this is a vote loser in the

1292
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:55,079
next election and they're they're

1293
00:53:52,039 --> 00:53:57,279
probably right about that um at the

1294
00:53:55,079 --> 00:53:59,240
current calculation but I you know I

1295
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:01,119
think pressure will continue to build

1296
00:53:59,239 --> 00:54:03,039
because the Jud you know judges as Johns

1297
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:04,599
recounted to you when you put in front

1298
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:06,119
of a judge the idea that you got to

1299
00:54:04,599 --> 00:54:07,599
sentence somebody for simple possession

1300
00:54:06,119 --> 00:54:10,318
or even for growing or trafficking

1301
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:11,960
cannabis when when we're making it legal

1302
00:54:10,318 --> 00:54:14,400
you know the judges are scratching their

1303
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:16,039
heads and saying what are we doing here

1304
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:17,960
uh and and at some point it may get

1305
00:54:16,039 --> 00:54:20,119
taken out of the hands of the government

1306
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:22,639
uh you know by the courts and there's

1307
00:54:20,119 --> 00:54:24,599
there's a I don't disagree with KK in

1308
00:54:22,639 --> 00:54:26,078
terms of the timeline I think you know

1309
00:54:24,599 --> 00:54:27,559
the spring they're supposed to introduce

1310
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:29,440
leg legislation and we'll see what

1311
00:54:27,559 --> 00:54:31,880
happens we have a similar problem to the

1312
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:33,599
us where the US you can have a

1313
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:35,599
government that takes a position but you

1314
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:37,559
got a congress that's stacked with still

1315
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:40,079
Republicans here we have a senate that

1316
00:54:37,559 --> 00:54:42,519
still has more conservatives so you know

1317
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:44,480
that needs to be fixed in order to make

1318
00:54:42,519 --> 00:54:47,159
sure everything goes through my

1319
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:49,920
experience with u you know as I say when

1320
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:51,960
I started people busted for very small

1321
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:55,159
amounts were're getting 30 days in jail

1322
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:58,079
and things like that and throughout the

1323
00:54:55,159 --> 00:55:00,519
70s and 80s and so on I've seen that

1324
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:02,720
reduce and reduce and reduce and to you

1325
00:55:00,519 --> 00:55:06,199
know it used to be a $100 fine was veryy

1326
00:55:02,719 --> 00:55:08,318
common and then discharges I do not get

1327
00:55:06,199 --> 00:55:11,439
people charged with possession anymore I

1328
00:55:08,318 --> 00:55:14,039
haven't had a possession case for ages

1329
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:15,798
other than sometimes a large amount that

1330
00:55:14,039 --> 00:55:17,279
in the past they would always charge

1331
00:55:15,798 --> 00:55:20,599
possession with the purpose of traffic

1332
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:22,960
now is a simple possession so I think

1333
00:55:20,599 --> 00:55:25,240
and I'm talking abord police who aren't

1334
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:27,358
known for necessarily them being very

1335
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:30,318
Progressive in in this at least in the

1336
00:55:27,358 --> 00:55:33,159
past uh and and even RCMP who are who

1337
00:55:30,318 --> 00:55:34,838
are known to be or less were thought to

1338
00:55:33,159 --> 00:55:37,558
be less Progressive although I I see

1339
00:55:34,838 --> 00:55:39,358
them coming around quite a bit as well

1340
00:55:37,559 --> 00:55:41,039
so that's pretty key but we still are

1341
00:55:39,358 --> 00:55:43,440
always going to run into that problem of

1342
00:55:41,039 --> 00:55:45,319
they'll use the smell in order to get

1343
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:48,639
into your car to find out what else

1344
00:55:45,318 --> 00:55:50,519
you've got or to arrest you simply to

1345
00:55:48,639 --> 00:55:53,078
then you know hassle you a bit before

1346
00:55:50,519 --> 00:55:56,480
they then drop the charge and again my

1347
00:55:53,079 --> 00:55:58,200
concern is is that you're in a database

1348
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:59,760
the minute that happens you're in the

1349
00:55:58,199 --> 00:56:01,439
database and there's some further

1350
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:05,880
information that can Prejudice you in

1351
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:09,119
the future so you know hopefully uh we

1352
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:12,318
will at least see a big movement in in

1353
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:15,000
the simple possession area uh but what

1354
00:56:12,318 --> 00:56:17,519
really needs to be addressed is as as

1355
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:20,358
Kirk said the the distribution and so on

1356
00:56:17,519 --> 00:56:22,440
you need to remember that at the moment

1357
00:56:20,358 --> 00:56:24,679
it's the federal government has the

1358
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:27,240
Constitutional power under its criminal

1359
00:56:24,679 --> 00:56:30,639
law power and control drugs and

1360
00:56:27,239 --> 00:56:33,798
Substances Act is a criminal law statute

1361
00:56:30,639 --> 00:56:35,920
okay and so if they take it out of the

1362
00:56:33,798 --> 00:56:39,119
control drugs and Substances Act out of

1363
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:41,440
the schedule then they're no longer

1364
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:44,358
using the criminal law power so what is

1365
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:46,960
the power it's health and that's a

1366
00:56:44,358 --> 00:56:49,519
divided field between the provinces and

1367
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:51,079
the federal government as Kirk said uh

1368
00:56:49,519 --> 00:56:53,679
so you need the provinces to get

1369
00:56:51,079 --> 00:56:58,200
involved as well and they've been not

1370
00:56:53,679 --> 00:57:00,719
jumping in at all I in uh in Seattle

1371
00:56:58,199 --> 00:57:03,679
Washington the district attorney there

1372
00:57:00,719 --> 00:57:05,279
made it a part of his uh platform when

1373
00:57:03,679 --> 00:57:07,318
he ran that he was not going to

1374
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:09,680
prosecute simple marijuana possession

1375
00:57:07,318 --> 00:57:11,838
cases he told the cops at and arrest

1376
00:57:09,679 --> 00:57:13,759
droughts this is before the initiative

1377
00:57:11,838 --> 00:57:16,960
passed to

1378
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:18,160
legalize and then uh to the other point

1379
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:19,838
about the two-part Point that's what

1380
00:57:18,159 --> 00:57:22,038
Oregon did they legalized possession

1381
00:57:19,838 --> 00:57:23,719
first and then came up with regulations

1382
00:57:22,039 --> 00:57:26,960
in order to get the ball rolling I think

1383
00:57:23,719 --> 00:57:28,439
we have time for two more

1384
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:31,000
I know you had your hand up the got to

1385
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:34,798
be quick I think it's 3:30 so long we

1386
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,798
got to make way for Ed Rosen here

1387
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:40,519
folks I've got a question for the panel

1388
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:42,318
um the M individuals were allowed to

1389
00:57:40,519 --> 00:57:44,798
grow for themselves friends and family

1390
00:57:42,318 --> 00:57:47,400
the mmpr allowed these joggernauts to

1391
00:57:44,798 --> 00:57:52,199
grow for multiple patients um thanks to

1392
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:54,480
two Smiths and one two saw the uh the

1393
00:57:52,199 --> 00:57:57,078
the derivatives um were allowed to be

1394
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:59,240
made by these joggernauts it seems that

1395
00:57:57,079 --> 00:58:01,880
they are limited to 3% potency which

1396
00:57:59,239 --> 00:58:04,000
seems like a form of insanity to me

1397
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:07,119
under the mm or sorry the

1398
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:09,318
acmpr um I'm told that individuals that

1399
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:12,000
used to be mm holders are now allowed to

1400
00:58:09,318 --> 00:58:13,480
make derivatives the legislation still

1401
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,318
states that you're allowed to collect

1402
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:17,480
four licenses to one property for

1403
00:58:15,318 --> 00:58:20,038
growing I've been told that you're

1404
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:22,039
allowed to collect the outdoor storage

1405
00:58:20,039 --> 00:58:23,520
facility under multiple licenses and

1406
00:58:22,039 --> 00:58:26,160
perhaps that would be a good place for

1407
00:58:23,519 --> 00:58:28,519
individuals to do extractions is there

1408
00:58:26,159 --> 00:58:30,879
limit on how many licenses can be in one

1409
00:58:28,519 --> 00:58:33,280
storage facility and is there a limit on

1410
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:36,760
the percentage value of the extraction

1411
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:39,920
made in those facilities yeah so uh in

1412
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:42,319
terms of uh patient uh making

1413
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:45,280
extractions or derivatives uh they don't

1414
00:58:42,318 --> 00:58:47,480
have any pocy limits in place uh you're

1415
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:50,359
not subject to the restrictions that the

1416
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:53,358
LIC producers are what you are

1417
00:58:50,358 --> 00:58:57,159
restricted to is that you're unable to

1418
00:58:53,358 --> 00:58:59,078
make any extractions using the acmpr

1419
00:58:57,159 --> 00:59:01,598
defines as organic solvents organic

1420
00:58:59,079 --> 00:59:03,760
solvents is then defined as butane

1421
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:05,119
couple other chemicals and and the

1422
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:07,480
katchall is basically anything that can

1423
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:10,358
blow up now you

1424
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:12,798
know let's be clear I think Smith

1425
00:59:10,358 --> 00:59:14,440
overrides that restriction I think that

1426
00:59:12,798 --> 00:59:16,199
derivative makers that are doing it

1427
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:18,000
safely have very good defenses under the

1428
00:59:16,199 --> 00:59:21,399
charter that that restriction supposed

1429
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:24,159
in the acmv is unconstitutional on its

1430
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:27,440
face uh I I've had I've got a couple of

1431
00:59:24,159 --> 00:59:30,719
cases currently of Prett big extract

1432
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:34,480
facilities uh that the Crown's making me

1433
00:59:30,719 --> 00:59:36,199
off as you can't refuse on um you know I

1434
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:39,920
don't think they want to litigate that

1435
00:59:36,199 --> 00:59:42,000
issue in the medical Arena right now so

1436
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:44,519
but but the answer to the question of

1437
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:47,239
extracting is no organic solvents uh

1438
00:59:44,519 --> 00:59:49,000
otherwise no potency limits you cannot

1439
00:59:47,239 --> 00:59:51,879
act your storage location under the

1440
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:54,440
acmpr for a production license has to

1441
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:57,440
either be at the production site or at

1442
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:59,440
your ordinary place of residence yeah so

1443
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:00,880
production site is artificially limited

1444
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:03,400
to four because you can only have four

1445
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:05,280
licenses at production site I suppose if

1446
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:07,599
you had like 20 people all living

1447
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:09,880
together in the same house there's no

1448
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:11,519
restriction that that those 20 people

1449
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:14,680
could have their storage site at that

1450
01:00:11,519 --> 01:00:16,838
one location I

1451
01:00:14,679 --> 01:00:19,118
mean you know but but then doing

1452
01:00:16,838 --> 01:00:21,239
extraction there uh you know the

1453
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:24,079
question would be is the extraction is

1454
01:00:21,239 --> 01:00:26,679
the derivative making part of production

1455
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:28,960
or is it part of possession right and

1456
01:00:26,679 --> 01:00:31,719
that's not defined by the acmpr so the

1457
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:34,760
locus of your derivative making hasn't

1458
01:00:31,719 --> 01:00:36,639
been mandated so you know I suppose

1459
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:38,920
theoretically you could aggregate a

1460
01:00:36,639 --> 01:00:41,798
whole ton of people living Under One

1461
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:44,280
Roof and tons of storage there and that

1462
01:00:41,798 --> 01:00:47,480
would give you protection for a great

1463
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:50,839
deal of cannabis to be stored there to

1464
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:52,719
process um but you know creative

1465
01:00:50,838 --> 01:00:55,038
compliance is sort of my manager right

1466
01:00:52,719 --> 01:00:57,239
the government makes rules lots of them

1467
01:00:55,039 --> 01:00:59,000
are arbitrary and

1468
01:00:57,239 --> 01:01:00,759
creatively comply with them you know as

1469
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:02,719
long as you're not breaking the rules

1470
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:04,599
you're not engaged in unlawful conduct

1471
01:01:02,719 --> 01:01:07,038
and I think that you know we're creative

1472
01:01:04,599 --> 01:01:08,079
people so we can do it but remember this

1473
01:01:07,039 --> 01:01:12,039
is

1474
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:14,720
politics and so every time you have an

1475
01:01:12,039 --> 01:01:19,039
explosion and a fire and somebody gets

1476
01:01:14,719 --> 01:01:21,558
hurt it sets back the cause okay every

1477
01:01:19,039 --> 01:01:22,920
time you have people stinking out the

1478
01:01:21,559 --> 01:01:24,440
neighborhood because they're not

1479
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:28,200
controlling the smell of their

1480
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:30,480
production you set back the cause I get

1481
01:01:28,199 --> 01:01:31,439
constant complaints from inspectors at

1482
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:34,639
various

1483
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:36,119
municipalities Conroy there's a grow

1484
01:01:34,639 --> 01:01:37,279
there and they're stinking out the

1485
01:01:36,119 --> 01:01:39,160
neighborhood and we got all the

1486
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:41,079
neighbors complaining so I have to get

1487
01:01:39,159 --> 01:01:42,719
somebody in there to teach them how to

1488
01:01:41,079 --> 01:01:44,960
do it without stinking out the

1489
01:01:42,719 --> 01:01:47,879
neighborhood we want the neighborhoods
