00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:24,719
All right. So, we're going to do another

3
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:25,880
little garden update here. I'm in about

4
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:28,399
week

5
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:30,320
four. The watermelon's producing very

6
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:33,000
nice nugs.

7
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:36,640
Nice resin content on the

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,719
leaves. Uh over here we have the Medi

9
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,280
Medic

10
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:45,320
Kush. And then we also have Oh, that's

11
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:49,039
nice. That mighty Kush. We also have

12
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:49,039
uh the Chem4

13
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:54,879
reunion. Under that Chem4 reunion, you

14
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:58,599
got a nice big fat watermelon nugget.

15
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:58,599
Look at that little guy.

16
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:02,439
Watermelon being the astro boy. You can

17
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:07,040
see some

18
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:07,039
nice nice nuggets stacking

19
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:13,719
here. Where's that other head? That this

20
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:18,360
guy here, this branch had a really

21
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:21,519
nice unique fat head. Got

22
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:23,200
to stake that one. Um, oh yeah, we got

23
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:25,359
the My Little Pony as well here in the

24
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,520
background. She hasn't really pushed out

25
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:30,118
her resin content yet. She's not covered

26
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:32,959
covered covered in resin, but

27
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:35,599
uh she sure has a real nice smell. So,

28
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:38,158
these are now being flushed. Um I'll

29
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:39,679
probably flush them for 5 weeks, if not

30
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,118
longer. I'm not exactly sure the

31
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,880
flowering times. I'm not really paying

32
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:45,680
attention, so it'll really be about what

33
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:47,759
I prefer. I'll uh probably snap off a

34
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:51,600
bud here and there, you know, cure it

35
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:53,759
out, dry it, and um dry sift it just to

36
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:55,478
see if the resin's melty and ready how I

37
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,478
like it. That's kind of a neat way to do

38
00:01:55,478 --> 00:02:00,000
it. And uh otherwise, yeah, I'll just

39
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:01,280
keep you guys updated on my little crop

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,438
here. I'll keep you updated on my

41
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,879
mother's. All right, so here we have the

42
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:08,439
Afghany and the Sweet Skunk. Just just

43
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:11,759
enjoying a little bit of

44
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:14,479
sun, you know. Little bit of beautiful

45
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:16,199
British Columbombian sun, ocean, and

46
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:18,000
mountains in the

47
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:20,679
background. This is going to be some

48
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,439
very happy moms. Both of these will be

49
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:25,200
moms. Uh Matt Safer soaped them before

50
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:28,400
he brought them. I see no signs of any

51
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:30,399
bugs or any mildews or any problems

52
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:34,560
whatsoever. Just real nice healthy

53
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,560
little plants. Sweet skunk and

54
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:42,959
Afghani. Next up we have the barb barra

55
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:46,639
bud update. Barbber's doing great. Um

56
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:48,800
really happy. Also bug free, mold free.

57
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:51,598
Really nice plant.

58
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:55,120
Uh, it's got a great tight interoting on

59
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:56,479
these arms. Matt's uh done a nice job. I

60
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,200
mean, this would be a great little plant

61
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:01,560
to uh to flower with just a single top.

62
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:03,759
It's growing four or five nice big

63
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,360
arms. Yeah. Well, it's not getting

64
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:06,199
flowered. Just going to be a mom for a

65
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,840
long

66
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:14,439
time. Mommy

67
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:14,439
styles. Thanks for watching. Peace.

morning. I've got to have me

80
00:04:09,878 --> 00:04:16,798
