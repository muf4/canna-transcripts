2
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:24,358
hey how's it going bubble man here uh

3
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:25,799
I've been filming my uh YouTube videos

4
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:27,400
with my good camera lately but it's

5
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,519
taken a long time to upload them so I'm

6
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:31,118
going to give you guys some mini

7
00:00:28,518 --> 00:00:33,280
episodes of what's going on right now we

8
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:35,200
are in a little makeshift hash making

9
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,679
room right now we've got uh a nice

10
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,480
little pile of Bud right here and a

11
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:43,960
bunch more right here I'm guessing we

12
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:47,558
must have I don't know 4 lb or something

13
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:49,000
3 or 4 lb uh mostly popcorn Buds and

14
00:00:47,558 --> 00:00:52,320
what we're doing is we're basically

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,840
gently we've got them out on the um 200

16
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:58,840
Lines no the 100 lines per inch yes 110

17
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,800
lines per inch which is a 140 Micron

18
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:03,800
screen it's a silk screen that's

19
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:05,599
extremely tightly uh glued to the frame

20
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:08,478
and what we do is we just gently bring

21
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:10,599
the buds back and forth ever so gently

22
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:13,079
not squeezing them not being too violent

23
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:14,438
with your work and uh what this is going

24
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:16,840
to do is it's going to give us a single

25
00:01:14,438 --> 00:01:19,559
screen extraction which by lifting the

26
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:21,520
screen up you can see there's a light

27
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,519
sift there and even in the corner I've

28
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:26,478
got a pile of gold over there already

29
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:29,118
it's nice slow work we're not trying to

30
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:30,799
beat the [ __ ] out of this material uh

31
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:32,920
like the Moroccans do with sticks to the

32
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:35,000
point where it's giving us you know 95%

33
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,079
contaminant we're really trying to

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,519
gently extract just the heads and from

35
00:01:37,078 --> 00:01:40,599
there we're going to do the secondary

36
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:42,280
process and we're going to do it outside

37
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:44,039
because that process is this is good to

38
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:46,159
do outside as well it makes the the

39
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,240
heads more brittle but the secondary

40
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,118
process of caring the material over the

41
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:51,798
screen and pushing that contaminant

42
00:01:50,118 --> 00:01:54,680
through the tighter hole while leaving

43
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:58,039
the gland heads on top of of the mesh

44
00:01:54,680 --> 00:02:00,479
it's um yeah it's a little bit of a

45
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:03,039
easier process much easier when done in

46
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:05,399
cold uh the capitate stocks and the cyth

47
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:08,080
hairs just seem to break much more uh

48
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:10,959
readily when it's very cold so stay

49
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:14,680
tuned for all of that and uh yeah we'll

50
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,680
be making more hash here

51
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:31,759
soon

52
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:01,759
